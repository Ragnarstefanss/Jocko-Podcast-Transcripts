00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.40 This is Jockel Pondcast number 279 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening,
00:00:06.40 --> 00:00:08.16 echo. Good evening.
00:00:10.56 --> 00:00:16.56 Helicopter blades slashed through the hot sky. The roar of engines
00:00:16.56 --> 00:00:20.24 deafening as the pilot twisted and turned on our final approach.
00:00:20.24 --> 00:00:24.32 Crammed into the back with my man, I tried to keep my balance by
00:00:24.32 --> 00:00:28.32 tensing my legs and focusing my gaze on the machine gun and the helicopter's door.
00:00:28.32 --> 00:00:34.32 My kit was heavy on my shoulders and sweat poured into my eyes from under the rim of my helmet.
00:00:34.32 --> 00:00:40.16 My palms were wet as they gripped the rifle. I pulled the closer to my chest and prepared
00:00:40.16 --> 00:00:46.48 myself for what was to come. The airman behind the machine gun turned to me. His face was
00:00:46.48 --> 00:00:51.36 covered by a scarf and the dark visor of his helmet, but I knew what he it meant when he
00:00:51.36 --> 00:01:01.04 held up his index finger. I turned and shouted to my man, one minute, one minute to landing
00:01:01.04 --> 00:01:09.20 and whatever was waiting there for us. Looking into the eyes of my young soldiers, I saw
00:01:09.20 --> 00:01:17.68 steely resolve the hardness of the paratrooper flying into battle. I was closest to the rear door
00:01:17.68 --> 00:01:22.72 which was now winching fully open. There was no doubt my mind that I had to be the first one
00:01:22.72 --> 00:01:30.08 down the ramp. I had waited years for this moment and now was my time. I'd practiced it over and
00:01:30.08 --> 00:01:36.72 over again on grass fields, in mock-up structures and on the real things during exercises all over
00:01:36.72 --> 00:01:43.12 the world, but this was different. For the first time in my life, I was flying into war.
00:01:43.12 --> 00:01:54.40 Our mission was a simple one to kill or capture a Taliban bomb maker. A bomb maker called
00:01:54.40 --> 00:02:00.48 Hajji Mohamed infamous for making the improvised bombs that were responsible for the deaths of
00:02:00.48 --> 00:02:08.56 dozens of British and Allied soldiers. We'd spent a week pouring over maps and aerial photographs
00:02:08.56 --> 00:02:14.56 of the village in which he was thought to live. My platoon, number eight platoon, on attachment to
00:02:14.56 --> 00:02:20.88 a company of the third battalion of the parachute regiment, was given the honor of landing first,
00:02:20.88 --> 00:02:28.56 right in Hajji Mohamed's back garden. It was our task to surround his house. It was a dangerous
00:02:28.56 --> 00:02:33.12 mission, but as the second counted down and I looked out the rear of the door of the helicopter
00:02:33.12 --> 00:02:38.80 towards the dusty plains below, I felt the tremendous sensation of both trepidation and sheer
00:02:38.80 --> 00:02:44.88 excitement. It was a lot of responsibility to shoulder, but I wanted to carry it.
00:02:46.48 --> 00:02:51.92 The helicopter got closer to the ground, whipping the Afghan dust into the air until it was
00:02:51.92 --> 00:02:58.40 a thick cloud around us. Ten seconds shouted the airman, holding tightly to a rope. The door
00:02:58.40 --> 00:03:04.88 was now fully open. The ramp hit the floor with a clunk and a shutter went through the airframe
00:03:04.88 --> 00:03:10.32 as the wheels touch down. Everyone wobbled but kept their feet. They knew how important it was
00:03:10.32 --> 00:03:13.68 to stay upright and get off the hea- the hea- the hea- the hea- the hea- the hea- the hea- the hea- the
00:03:14.88 --> 00:03:20.000 the Taliban had spies everywhere, scouts that reported the movement of helicopters. Every second
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:30.40 that we delayed detaining was a second for the enemy to train their weapons and kill those on the ramp.
00:03:30.40 --> 00:03:35.52 My self and my man picking up the call so that it rippled through the aircraft.
00:03:36.48 --> 00:03:40.48 And then we were running, greeting our teeth as though that would stop the bullets that may
00:03:40.48 --> 00:03:46.08 await us. My feet touch down on the Afghan soil and I breathed in the dirt as I ran through the
00:03:46.08 --> 00:03:51.36 cloud that the helicopters blades stirred up all around us. My rifle was up at eye level and I
00:03:51.36 --> 00:03:56.96 looked over my sights ready to snap shoot anyone that posed a threat to my men. My soldiers followed
00:03:56.96 --> 00:04:02.08 me. I felt like a giant leading them from a metal beast into the jaws of death.
00:04:05.12 --> 00:04:10.08 Except that when the helicopter lifted away and the dust settled, we were quite alone.
00:04:10.08 --> 00:04:20.32 Nobody home. Shit. I put someone my men into defensive positions and took others with me to
00:04:20.32 --> 00:04:26.16 search the house. This was still a dangerous time as the Taliban were not above booby trapping their own homes.
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.20 Other than a few sacks of opium, the drug of choice in those parts we found nothing.
00:04:34.64 --> 00:04:39.68 I walked back outside and was shrugging off the disappointment of another quiet mission
00:04:39.68 --> 00:04:44.40 when a whip-like sound echoed across the fields followed immediately by a crack.
00:04:46.64 --> 00:04:52.000 It wasn't the noise you hear in the films. It was all together more visceral and unnerving.
00:04:53.12 --> 00:04:57.92 Incoming shouted my platoon sergeant. I shouted at the men to jump into a nearby ditch and
00:04:57.92 --> 00:05:04.08 return fire. They looked at me unbelieving. It was like being on an exercise on the salt's
00:05:04.08 --> 00:05:10.64 buried plain except the noises were not the dull simulator. We'd been accustomed to. These were
00:05:10.64 --> 00:05:16.80 real and violent. Somebody was shooting with the evident intention of killing us.
00:05:19.52 --> 00:05:24.88 300 meters away, I saw the enemy moving in a line of trees. I took aim and fired.
00:05:24.88 --> 00:05:40.80 It was the start of a very long day. And that right there is an excerpt from a book called
00:05:41.68 --> 00:05:49.52 the Art of Exploration by a former British Army officer named Levison Wood who served in
00:05:49.52 --> 00:05:56.40 lead combat operations in Afghanistan. But who seemed to have found an equivalent level of
00:05:56.40 --> 00:06:05.76 excitement and danger as a writer for Tografer filmmaker and explorer. And we're lucky enough to
00:06:05.76 --> 00:06:14.40 have him on the show tonight to share some of his experiences with us. Levison, thanks for coming on, man.
00:06:14.40 --> 00:06:20.000 Thanks for having me. That's a good way to start this thing off. Bring back some memories, hey?
00:06:21.36 --> 00:06:29.52 For again, good way to kick it off. Before we jump into your your career in the army,
00:06:29.52 --> 00:06:34.88 let's let's start at the beginning. Let's start about, let's talk about your child's childhood and
00:06:34.88 --> 00:06:41.84 you grow up in England. Sure. Yeah. Stoke on Trent. That's it. Not many people have heard of it.
00:06:41.84 --> 00:06:48.08 And that's where you actually grew up. Yeah. So I was born and raised in a small village just outside
00:06:48.08 --> 00:06:52.40 of Stoke on Trent, right in the middle of England, sort of halfway between Manchester and Birmingham,
00:06:52.88 --> 00:06:58.80 kind of place that not many people sort of travel to. They just travel past it. And I think it was
00:06:59.36 --> 00:07:04.32 it was for that reason that I was always from a very young age curious about the outside world.
00:07:04.32 --> 00:07:10.72 I was very keen to get away from Stoke on Trent. It will always be home, but yeah, from up from
00:07:10.72 --> 00:07:16.40 a very early age, I was always excited by the prospect of traveling out into the big wide world.
00:07:16.40 --> 00:07:22.000 It was something that not many members of my family had done. But I always knew that there was
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.52 more to life than the provincial sort of suburbs of my hometown and that's one inspired me.
00:07:27.52 --> 00:07:33.84 And Stoke on Trent, that's a city where you're in, I guess it was prior to the pits shutting
00:07:33.84 --> 00:07:39.68 down. You were in the pits or there's a giant pottery factory, right? Yeah. Isn't it famous for
00:07:39.68 --> 00:07:45.12 making pottery? Stoke on Trent is the heart of the British ceramic industry. It has been for
00:07:45.12 --> 00:07:52.000 for centuries. And sadly, you know, a lot of those industries, the mines and the pottery industry
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.48 died a bit of a death through the mid-20th century. So there was a lot of unemployment. There was a lot
00:07:56.48 --> 00:08:02.16 of poverty in Stoke on Trent in the 80s when I grew up. And so there weren't that many opportunities.
00:08:02.16 --> 00:08:06.88 Not many people had the opportunities to travel very much. But I was very fortunate to be
00:08:06.88 --> 00:08:11.44 grown up in a family of teachers, both my parents were teachers. They encouraged this spirit
00:08:11.44 --> 00:08:17.68 of curiosity. And encouraged me to read a lot. So I read as a young star at all about history,
00:08:17.68 --> 00:08:24.08 geography, travels, all those stories of exploration of those very hairy men in the 19th century
00:08:24.08 --> 00:08:30.64 that went to the polls, living stone and shackle-turn and scot. And those are my heroes. So it
00:08:30.64 --> 00:08:35.60 was growing up, my dad read me a lot of books about exploration, Lawrence of Arabia, people like that.
00:08:35.60 --> 00:08:41.20 And so I think from about the age of seven or eight, I was determined to somehow follow in their
00:08:41.20 --> 00:08:47.04 footsteps, which wasn't exactly a very realistic sort of thing to go to my careers officer
00:08:47.04 --> 00:08:51.60 or say I want to be an explorer. But that's exactly what I did. And he sort of laughed at me and said,
00:08:51.60 --> 00:08:55.28 okay, well, let's see. Well, I'm kind of thinking you must have been even in a worse position than me.
00:08:55.28 --> 00:09:00.40 So when I was a little kid, you know, I like rock and roll music. And so when I started playing guitar
00:09:00.40 --> 00:09:06.000 and thinking, okay, I'm going to write some riffs. But it didn't take me very long to figure out that,
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.44 hey, all the, you know, if Jimmy Page already wrote that riff and Tony, I owe me already wrote those riffs.
00:09:11.44 --> 00:09:15.76 So what am I going to do? How am I going to write better riffs than those guys? So you had to be even
00:09:15.76 --> 00:09:22.40 in a worse position because the way you would explode. Yeah, actually you can make up new riffs. That's possible.
00:09:22.40 --> 00:09:28.16 But you know, the most of the known world has been explored. Yeah. So you're, you're in a worse
00:09:28.16 --> 00:09:33.92 part than I was in. Well, my, you know, I grew up with those stories. But I was also encouraged by
00:09:33.92 --> 00:09:40.72 stories of my grandfather. My granddad was a soldier in in the British army. He served in
00:09:40.72 --> 00:09:46.32 India and Burma and the Far East, fighting against the Japanese. And he told me these stories,
00:09:46.32 --> 00:09:52.32 which felt whilst it was still a long time ago, actually to hear them firsthand, somebody who'd
00:09:52.32 --> 00:09:58.40 been to the jungles of India who'd been to the mountains of, of, of East Asia. That was like my
00:09:58.40 --> 00:10:05.20 blog for me as a kid who'd never really traveled beyond the confines of the United Kingdom. So that's what
00:10:05.20 --> 00:10:08.88 I wanted to do. I wanted to go and see, not necessarily go with my Pythelmit and sort of cocky
00:10:08.88 --> 00:10:14.16 shorts and with a big union flag. But but at the very least, to go and see with my own eyes, the
00:10:14.16 --> 00:10:20.64 the kind of places that very few people had had traveled to within my own social circle, really.
00:10:20.64 --> 00:10:25.20 So it started pretty humbly and I'm just going off backpacking and, you know, doing what a lot
00:10:25.20 --> 00:10:30.000 of youngsters do and and travel around the world on a tight budget. And that was what I was determined
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.04 to do from from a very young age. Now, what was your relationship with your grandfather? How long
00:10:35.04 --> 00:10:40.64 was this he saw alive today? No, he's not. So he passed away when I was about 18. So, you know,
00:10:40.64 --> 00:10:46.08 but growing up it was like, say it was those really exciting stories and pretty gruesome stories.
00:10:46.08 --> 00:10:53.52 I know. Like if you were in Burma fight with the Japanese, good Lord. Yeah, and he was not only that,
00:10:53.52 --> 00:10:57.20 he was on pretty much one of the first ships into Japan. He was part of the occupying force in
00:10:57.20 --> 00:11:03.20 Japan. He was based in Hiroshima after they dropped the A-bomb. So some of his stories were just like,
00:11:03.20 --> 00:11:09.76 you know, crazy. Yeah. And what about your dad, did your dad, um, wasn't your dad in the army as
00:11:09.76 --> 00:11:15.92 well? So my dad was in the, he was a reservist. So, you know, throughout the 70s and 80s, you know, his
00:11:15.92 --> 00:11:20.64 period, it was, it was the Cold War. So he, you know, he likes to tell me he was off fighting the Russians
00:11:20.64 --> 00:11:24.64 and Germany, you know, it, it, it really, you know, realistically he was, he was out there.
00:11:25.36 --> 00:11:30.32 A lot of digging trenches on the plains of Germany, but obviously no, no actual fighting. But,
00:11:30.56 --> 00:11:36.56 but yeah, he always encouraged me to, to take an interest in the military. And, um, it was
00:11:36.56 --> 00:11:40.96 things like, you know, he was a cadet instructor and so on. So I remember growing up, you know,
00:11:40.96 --> 00:11:46.32 he'd sometimes bring his rifles back over and things like that. And, uh, as a kid, he'd give me a
00:11:46.32 --> 00:11:51.84 uniform and if I was, if I was a good, good kid, he'd give me an extra striped for, and if I was
00:11:51.84 --> 00:11:55.36 naughty, he'd hit, hit, hit, hit, what off my arm? So that's kind of, that was how I grew up. Yeah.
00:11:56.40 --> 00:12:00.64 And, what, when you, um, were you a, you're saying that you're reading all the time?
00:12:00.64 --> 00:12:02.64 Mm-hmm. Does that mean you were a good student?
00:12:02.64 --> 00:12:06.64 I was, I think I, I was always curious and, and that helps. I think that's a good stuff.
00:12:06.64 --> 00:12:08.72 You might be the first person on the podcast. That was a good thing.
00:12:08.72 --> 00:12:10.32 We ever had any good students on here?
00:12:10.32 --> 00:12:13.36 Everyone's never just bad students, myself included.
00:12:14.16 --> 00:12:18.56 So, so you were reading and you're doing pretty good in school. Your parents were,
00:12:18.56 --> 00:12:21.12 so both my parents were teachers as well. She'll, yeah.
00:12:21.12 --> 00:12:26.24 And, one was history, one was English, and, and people go, oh, that's right. And I was like,
00:12:26.24 --> 00:12:32.72 no, no, I didn't do it. I didn't do it in your homework. Um, were they teaching in your school?
00:12:32.72 --> 00:12:36.24 No, they weren't. Was your dad teaching in your school? No, no, no, no, so that, yeah, I think that helped.
00:12:36.24 --> 00:12:40.24 I don't think I would have liked having my teachers, my parents, as my own teachers.
00:12:40.24 --> 00:12:45.68 But, they, they got you on the reading path. And I, it must be, it must be something born.
00:12:45.68 --> 00:12:50.64 Like, you just must have been more naturally curious than me. I was like throwing rocks at my friends.
00:12:50.64 --> 00:12:52.24 No, I did that as well.
00:12:52.24 --> 00:12:58.32 Yeah, I mean, I think I, I was definitely a bit of a rebel. And I got a lot of trouble as a kid.
00:12:58.32 --> 00:13:03.92 I think I was just naturally inclined to, to be curious about history, particularly in that.
00:13:03.92 --> 00:13:09.20 It was, it was reading about, you know, the ancient Greeks, Alexander the Great, the Roman Empire, the Vikings.
00:13:09.20 --> 00:13:13.52 It was those sort of exciting, quite, you know, quite masculine, manly stories that,
00:13:13.52 --> 00:13:18.72 that really inspired me to sort of take an interest. And, and I did from a, from an early age.
00:13:18.72 --> 00:13:23.36 And of course, it's, it's those sort of things that you read and then develop.
00:13:23.36 --> 00:13:28.56 I mean, one of the first books that my dad read to me was, was a children's version of the Odyssey.
00:13:28.56 --> 00:13:32.000 And I thought, you know, one day I'd love to go off on a ship and explore the world.
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000 You know, I mean, hopefully not lose all my men in the process. But, you know,
00:13:36.72 --> 00:13:42.72 but yeah, I definitely thank those, those early years for my, what I'm doing now.
00:13:44.08 --> 00:13:48.48 So, the weird thing about, well, one of the big differences about England and America is the schooling
00:13:48.48 --> 00:13:53.04 system and kind of the way you test to get into certain levels and my wife's a Brit.
00:13:53.04 --> 00:13:58.08 So I have some idea of it. But you, so you went to what, what, what,
00:13:58.08 --> 00:14:01.52 pain's Lee is that right? Pain's Lee Catholic School? That's where you went to.
00:14:01.52 --> 00:14:06.16 Yeah. So it was a non-fee paying. It was just an ordinary state school.
00:14:07.12 --> 00:14:10.48 But it was, you know, as a Catholic school, the Catholic schools were,
00:14:10.48 --> 00:14:15.04 we're not sometimes, you know, considered better in, in some ways.
00:14:15.04 --> 00:14:21.76 You know, a real bent-ward science. That wasn't my bag at all. But good teachers. And, um,
00:14:21.76 --> 00:14:26.08 it was one of those schools that that you can, you can flourish in with, with the right attitude.
00:14:26.08 --> 00:14:30.96 But, but also you can get a lot of trouble if you don't have the right attitude. And I, I sort of
00:14:30.96 --> 00:14:37.92 do both. What, what, what sport were you playing? Um, so I wouldn't say I was hugely into sports.
00:14:37.92 --> 00:14:42.64 I, I preferred, I was into athletics. I was a good runner as a kid. But I wasn't,
00:14:42.64 --> 00:14:46.56 wasn't really know for its team sports. And that kind of frustrated me in, in some ways,
00:14:46.56 --> 00:14:53.36 because, you know, I knew that I was kind of, sold on the idea of the army from probably the age of about
00:14:53.36 --> 00:14:58.48 11 or 12 in fact. So I knew that I should probably be doing rugby or something like that. But
00:14:58.48 --> 00:15:03.28 it wasn't really unauthor in my school. So I had to be creative with, with what I was doing. So I took
00:15:03.28 --> 00:15:07.84 did a lot of personal fitness, did a lot of running, like I said. Um, I was interested in boxing
00:15:07.84 --> 00:15:11.44 from the ongagging that that's something that I took up. And, and that followed me into my
00:15:11.44 --> 00:15:16.96 army career as well. So what age, you start boxing now? Um, I mean, I was training from probably
00:15:16.96 --> 00:15:22.56 15, 16. Um, when I went to university at 18, I was in the university club. And then, like I said,
00:15:22.56 --> 00:15:28.48 did it throughout the army as well. So I know you, you went on like, uh, this is, I don't know if
00:15:28.48 --> 00:15:35.12 Americans do this or not. They go like traveling. Yeah. That's what you all call it, right? My wife did it.
00:15:35.12 --> 00:15:40.96 Oh, traveling, right? And so, and so you did that, too. Like, in America, you graduate high school,
00:15:40.96 --> 00:15:44.64 then if you're either going in the military or getting a job or you're, you're going, there's no
00:15:44.64 --> 00:15:50.72 traveling mode. There's no traveling thing. Echo did you go traveling? No, sir. No. We're not going
00:15:50.72 --> 00:15:55.52 traveling for a year, but it's real normal. Oh, yeah. And it's something that is now. You know, when I,
00:15:55.52 --> 00:16:04.48 when I left school, it was 18 in 2001, um, yeah, I knew that I wanted to join the army. And I was
00:16:04.48 --> 00:16:09.04 sort of, I really wanted to go to Sandhurst and go in as an officer and done. But because of my
00:16:09.04 --> 00:16:12.72 background, I wasn't, you know, one of these posh private schools, I hadn't, you know,
00:16:12.72 --> 00:16:16.48 necessarily got the sports background. So I knew I needed to do something that would give me a bit of
00:16:16.48 --> 00:16:22.56 an edge. And it was, it was a joke drinking an Australian. Yeah. That's exactly that. But it, it was
00:16:22.56 --> 00:16:26.32 actually a stroke of, unfortunately, not. So when I was a kid, I was, I was doing every odd job
00:16:26.32 --> 00:16:30.96 going. I worked in factories. I was in shops. I would even flip burgers up with Donald's just to try
00:16:30.96 --> 00:16:35.44 and get some cash together. I flip burgers at Wendy's. So we go. Yeah. It's got to be a
00:16:35.44 --> 00:16:39.52 kind of a building still making of great military leadership, flipping burgers, get some.
00:16:40.88 --> 00:16:44.80 So I was doing all of that to try and earn a bit of bit of cash before going to university.
00:16:44.80 --> 00:16:48.72 And one of the jobs I was doing was working as a theme park, um, the place called Altantowers.
00:16:49.28 --> 00:16:54.32 And I think, you know, I was basically, I must be on one of the rides upside down and I lost my wallet,
00:16:54.32 --> 00:16:58.56 fell out my pocket and I was a bit upset because I had my entire weeks earnings but about five pounds
00:16:58.56 --> 00:17:03.68 in. So it's quite surprise. A couple of days later when the wallet was returned in the post.
00:17:03.68 --> 00:17:08.56 And not only was the five pounds still in there, but there was also a note from the person who would
00:17:08.56 --> 00:17:13.52 found the wallet. And it was actually signed off. There was a note saying, don't be such a,
00:17:13.52 --> 00:17:18.80 you know, I won't say the word. If it's just an asshole for losing your wallet, keep, keep
00:17:18.80 --> 00:17:23.92 better, sort of carry your belongings. It was signed off by a certain lieutenant.
00:17:23.92 --> 00:17:28.96 Day in the odd in the Royal Artillery. And I thought, oh, that's a nice, nice guy. I was
00:17:28.96 --> 00:17:33.60 not everyone who would return a wallet. And so I, you know, I did the right thing and wrote a
00:17:33.60 --> 00:17:37.84 thank you letter back. I feel like I know what I said. You're lesson is cost new five.
00:17:39.44 --> 00:17:43.76 That's mine. So I said it, but it, because I was already interested in the career and they
00:17:43.76 --> 00:17:48.88 always said, if you got any hints or tips on how to get into Sandhurst. And by return of post
00:17:48.88 --> 00:17:54.80 came back a six page essay with all of these really great tips. It was like, you know, go and
00:17:54.80 --> 00:17:59.92 learn how to read a map and use a compass. This is how many press ups you need to do to pass the
00:17:59.92 --> 00:18:05.12 fitness test. All this really useful advice. But the last sentence is something I'll never
00:18:05.12 --> 00:18:10.72 forget. But it could said above all travel dot dot dot, because at the end of the day, you'll have
00:18:10.72 --> 00:18:16.72 some great stories in the bar and the mess. So I took that to heart. So I decided based on that letter,
00:18:16.72 --> 00:18:20.96 which was all the, this serenity of the results of me losing my wallet, that I was going to go
00:18:20.96 --> 00:18:25.60 when, do what we call an Englander gap year, which is exactly what you say, go drinking Australia.
00:18:26.16 --> 00:18:30.48 So my, my, I told my dad and he said, what on earth is a gap year? This wasn't particularly
00:18:30.48 --> 00:18:34.80 popular, you know, that time. And I said it, you know, it's going to go find myself on the beaches
00:18:34.80 --> 00:18:39.68 of Thailand. And he said, well, if you do that, you can go get yourself a bloody job. So that's
00:18:39.68 --> 00:18:43.84 what I had to go and start earning more cash. And, but eventually, I did, I went away backpacking.
00:18:44.56 --> 00:18:48.48 And at the age of 18, you know, to literally just disappear off the first place I went traveling
00:18:48.48 --> 00:18:53.04 was actually in South Africa. I was just pretty, pretty dodgy, you know, in that time,
00:18:53.04 --> 00:18:58.40 which is in Bobway, which, which at the age of 18, it was the first time I'd had a gun pulled on me
00:18:58.40 --> 00:19:05.60 by a taxi driver who tried to rob me. So it was all really quite, you know, sort of, it teaches you
00:19:05.60 --> 00:19:09.20 a lot about independence. So what do you learn about how to handle getting a gun pulled on you
00:19:09.20 --> 00:19:13.12 by the taxi driver? Well, you can't just throw that out there. I think we're just going to let it
00:19:13.12 --> 00:19:17.60 ride. So, so I've been in the, so you're in the bar, so it's in Bobway. I was traveling, I've met
00:19:17.60 --> 00:19:22.88 this random Dutch dude who was much older than me. I was 18, this guy must have been 2930.
00:19:23.60 --> 00:19:29.36 He was backpacking as well. And we were on the same route. And we got off the train as
00:19:29.36 --> 00:19:36.16 place called Bulloeway. And we sort of got into a taxi and asked the price to whatever the,
00:19:36.16 --> 00:19:41.12 the next bus station. And he said it was going to be $40, which is in Bobway, has dollars. So,
00:19:41.12 --> 00:19:45.36 $40 is equivalent of about $2 US dollars. And we like, yeah, and it brought me. So we put our
00:19:45.36 --> 00:19:49.44 bags in the trunk of the car off again. And it was like two minutes round of corner. We thought,
00:19:49.44 --> 00:19:55.28 okay, we got out and he said okay, $40. We got the Zimbabwe dollars out and he said, no, no,
00:19:55.28 --> 00:20:00.000 you rest dollars, 40 US dollars. And we thought he was joking. And laughed at him. He said, no, no,
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.60 police handling is Jack, it pulls out a piston, said 40 US dollars. And we're like, oh, shit,
00:20:05.60 --> 00:20:10.000 okay, well, I don't have 40 US dollars. I'm going to budget about $2 a day. So we said,
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.32 okay, we'll pay, but let's get our bags out. And it was quite a busy crowded sort of car park.
00:20:14.32 --> 00:20:20.08 So we got our bags out the boot and this guy's Dutch guy, who's called it, you know,
00:20:20.08 --> 00:20:25.04 called a hefty fella. He said, okay, come over here and the taxidol, I'll be put his pistol
00:20:25.04 --> 00:20:29.68 in the car, he got out. So he's on the arm at the time. And this guy just sort of, as he got
00:20:29.68 --> 00:20:35.04 his bag on his back just headbutted this taxi driver, right? And then looked at me and said,
00:20:35.04 --> 00:20:41.44 fucking run. So I ran and we escaped. But this guy then we jumped in another taxidol, drive.
00:20:41.44 --> 00:20:45.52 So, but the original guy was chasing us through the streets of, of,
00:20:45.52 --> 00:20:49.84 a bullet-away. So I had my first, not only my first sort of gunpulled on me, but my first car
00:20:49.84 --> 00:20:55.52 chase at the age of 18, which is all pretty wild. But it was those early travels that sort of
00:20:55.52 --> 00:21:00.24 encouraged me to sort of, yeah, be careful, be independent minded and start to think about
00:21:00.24 --> 00:21:03.12 looking after myself. What are the chances that you made it back
00:21:03.76 --> 00:21:08.24 through the first year of travels? Well, well, after that experience, it was all fairly
00:21:08.24 --> 00:21:12.64 tell you, I have to say, but you know, getting joined in Australia. But it was no, it was great.
00:21:12.64 --> 00:21:17.60 And it was probably that first year of travel really that motivated me to want to do more.
00:21:17.60 --> 00:21:22.96 Because, you know, I popped from that, that one sort of moment, it was usual backpacking stuff.
00:21:22.96 --> 00:21:28.32 But throughout my time at university, I went to more and more challenging and interesting places.
00:21:28.32 --> 00:21:34.96 I went to, in my second year at university, I was studying history. And my particular interest
00:21:34.96 --> 00:21:39.84 was the history of travel writing. So I looked at Marco Polo and his travels. I was reading about
00:21:39.84 --> 00:21:45.52 the Hippitraele of the 1960s, the great pilgrimages, all the big overland journeys. So I tried
00:21:46.16 --> 00:21:52.72 to make all my studies around that. So in my summer leave, I would try and go to the place that I've
00:21:52.72 --> 00:21:58.08 been studying around. So after one particular module, bear in mind, this was in 2001, just after
00:21:58.08 --> 00:22:02.72 none 11, had happened. So there's a real focus on the Middle East. And that was a place that I was
00:22:02.72 --> 00:22:07.44 fascinated by because of the history. But also what was going on in the news at the time.
00:22:08.64 --> 00:22:12.88 So me and a buddy decided on some of that we were going to go and travel around the Middle East.
00:22:12.88 --> 00:22:19.52 This was in 2003. So it was a second year at university. The Iraq war was happening.
00:22:20.16 --> 00:22:23.76 And we said, okay, we're going to go to Egypt and just have a look around that we're going to
00:22:23.76 --> 00:22:29.36 Israel. And then when we were in Israel, there was a bomb went off in Jerusalem, caused the borders
00:22:29.36 --> 00:22:35.44 to shut. So what we plan to do was take a boat from the coast, from high-fer to Greece, and then
00:22:35.44 --> 00:22:41.20 go back back into Europe. That was all now not on the cards. My parents thought, I thought,
00:22:41.20 --> 00:22:44.24 maybe I might make Alex, we're actually on holiday in Greece at the time. Anyway, so they had no
00:22:44.24 --> 00:22:49.28 idea where we actually were. The only board that was open was to the East to Jordan. So we went to
00:22:49.28 --> 00:22:53.68 Jordan. And then we were in Jordan, another bomb went off, which meant that we were stuck in Jordan.
00:22:53.68 --> 00:22:58.24 The only board of the end was open. It was actually further east, which was to Iraq. So we took
00:22:58.24 --> 00:23:03.76 a taxi from the capital of Jordan, a man all the way to Baghdad at a cost of $20. This was,
00:23:03.76 --> 00:23:10.40 I was 21 at the time, or 20. And I was met by a national guardman on the border who said,
00:23:10.40 --> 00:23:16.24 to have joined by a gun. He said you're going to need it. Wait, you're going to go. This is 2003.
00:23:16.24 --> 00:23:19.60 And we got to Baghdad because it was the only route that was open.
00:23:19.60 --> 00:23:25.92 And we went in 2003, August. So the war is it's on? It's on. Yeah, combat operations are just
00:23:25.92 --> 00:23:33.28 finished, more or less. But before the main insurgency had begun, but stuff was definitely exploding around
00:23:33.28 --> 00:23:40.24 us at the time. And what part of this idea sounded smart to you? Well, we didn't have another option.
00:23:40.24 --> 00:23:44.24 We couldn't afford to fly home from Israel because we had their money. And we thought it would
00:23:44.24 --> 00:23:49.92 just be a bit of an exciting adventure. And so we made it to Baghdad, but then we stayed in the hotel
00:23:49.92 --> 00:23:57.12 Palestine. Oh, I know where that is. That's freaking crazy. We couldn't afford a night there because
00:23:57.12 --> 00:24:01.92 it was 100 bucks, which is a lot of money when you were a student. And so we thought, okay,
00:24:01.92 --> 00:24:05.20 this was just after somebody had just shot the top of the hotel because they thought there's an
00:24:05.20 --> 00:24:10.40 Iraqi assert in Surgeon. It was actually a camera crew. So we thought if we can sneak up the fire
00:24:10.40 --> 00:24:14.96 escape up the ladders, then we can just sleep amongst the rubble on the roof. So we did that.
00:24:14.96 --> 00:24:20.56 We got into the roof and then there happened to be a UK, a British film crew filming a newspiece
00:24:20.56 --> 00:24:24.72 on the roof and they said, you know, what are you idiots doing here? And we explained that we
00:24:24.72 --> 00:24:28.40 are sort of backpacking through the middle east. And this guy's, I don't remember if we were
00:24:28.40 --> 00:24:33.44 to get his name Martin Geisler, who's an ITN correspondence, said, look, you must be the first
00:24:33.44 --> 00:24:38.08 tourist in Iraq. Tell you what, if we can do a newspiece about you, we'll pay for your room.
00:24:38.08 --> 00:24:42.08 So we ended up staying for a week because we couldn't get, we couldn't get out of Iraq at this point.
00:24:42.08 --> 00:24:49.20 And eventually we managed to escape by hitching a ride with some former SAS mercenary security
00:24:49.20 --> 00:24:53.76 guys who were doing the route up to Crete, which was before Saddam Hussein had been captured.
00:24:53.76 --> 00:24:57.76 So we actually had an intercrete before Saddam whilst he was still down his little hole.
00:24:58.32 --> 00:25:02.08 So eventually long story short, we got out to Turkey and then eventually did find it.
00:25:02.08 --> 00:25:07.36 Final way back to Europe. Major amount of survivor bias on this whole thing. So anyone that's
00:25:07.36 --> 00:25:14.88 listening, you have to overcome this survivor bias, I'm going to recommend not particularly following
00:25:14.88 --> 00:25:20.96 this extreme level of let's just go for it. What are you carrying in your backpack?
00:25:22.08 --> 00:25:26.000 It's little as possible, you know, a shemag just so we could kind of blend in. We had to go to the
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.24 local market to buy you sort of traditional how many liters is your backpack? Just a day sack.
00:25:32.24 --> 00:25:37.92 So we were talking about 20, 20 liters. You've got a 25 liter backpack. Yeah, that's it. That's it.
00:25:37.92 --> 00:25:43.04 And we even put that, you know those sort of plastic big bags, this sort of check check ones that
00:25:43.04 --> 00:25:49.60 people go to the market in it. Okay. Just so we didn't stand out and we bought those shiny
00:25:49.60 --> 00:25:53.68 shirts and black shoes that they were in the middle east so that we, you know, I'm quite
00:25:53.68 --> 00:25:58.24 sort of fairly dark in. So we could blend in and it worked and we were just sort of walking on
00:25:58.24 --> 00:26:05.68 the markets of back down and you know, it was fine. Do not try this at home. Do not try this.
00:26:05.68 --> 00:26:10.48 I did some of my parents still about sexual pleasure. So then you finally, so then you finally get out.
00:26:10.48 --> 00:26:14.88 How do you get back? You just hitch a ride with some wind. We hitched a ride. Contractors? Yeah,
00:26:14.88 --> 00:26:20.80 ride it to the untouch border and then we'll hitch the way home to the UK. How long is it to hitchhike these
00:26:20.80 --> 00:26:27.28 days? I actually, I was hitch out last week actually in the States. And you got picked up pretty
00:26:27.28 --> 00:26:32.32 fast. Yeah, it's fine. It depends where you are. But I, you know, I used to love it because it was
00:26:32.32 --> 00:26:38.16 a great way of meeting interesting people. And in fact, when I, it's also a great way to get
00:26:38.16 --> 00:26:44.40 kidding. It can happen. It can happen. But I think what my trips at taught me was you got
00:26:44.40 --> 00:26:48.72 out of a bit of faith in human nature. You have way more faith than human nature than I do. I've
00:26:48.72 --> 00:26:53.44 done too many, these five guests to be jumping in vehicles with random people. It's weird too
00:26:53.44 --> 00:26:57.28 because when I was a kid and I don't know, I guess I'm 10 years old as a new, maybe,
00:26:58.40 --> 00:27:02.32 yeah, something around 10 or 12. But when I was a kid hitchhiking was very normal. Yeah.
00:27:02.32 --> 00:27:05.84 You'd see it all the time. People, you know, you go get on the highway. Yeah. I hitchhike and there's
00:27:05.84 --> 00:27:09.36 no big deal. If I miss the school bus, we hitchhike. Yeah. You go on things like that. Yeah.
00:27:09.36 --> 00:27:13.84 But nowadays people, people are more scared. It's way more scared. And I guess that's part of
00:27:13.84 --> 00:27:17.92 that is just there's more news is more prevalent. Well, like when someone gets kidnapped and freaking
00:27:17.92 --> 00:27:25.28 raped and murdered, you know about it. Whereas in 1978, it was just no factor. No. In your mind,
00:27:25.28 --> 00:27:31.28 that didn't happen to people. You trusted human nature. Yeah. Yeah. And all this is taking place
00:27:31.28 --> 00:27:34.64 while you're going to college. So you're the worst. You have nodding him. That's right. Yeah. So I
00:27:34.64 --> 00:27:40.08 stood in history every summer we'd go off and do some crazy adventure. But it all kind of
00:27:40.08 --> 00:27:47.68 built up really to when I graduated in the summer of 2004. So I still desperate joined the army
00:27:47.68 --> 00:27:53.12 but I'd got the travel bucket at the stage. So I wanted to sort of do something even bigger and better.
00:27:53.84 --> 00:27:57.92 And because I've been studying about these overland journeys, I decided I should really
00:27:58.72 --> 00:28:04.08 do a bit do a really big one. And so I thought I'd want to actually hitchhike
00:28:04.08 --> 00:28:07.68 all the way to India following the ancient Silk Road and following the footsteps of sort of
00:28:07.68 --> 00:28:13.36 market polo. So I did. I hitchhiked from, I put my thumb up at notting them service station
00:28:13.36 --> 00:28:20.32 and five months later somehow made it to go or in India. And that was a wild journey because
00:28:20.32 --> 00:28:25.76 it went through all of Europe through Russia and through the Caucasus. I was in Chechnya.
00:28:26.72 --> 00:28:33.20 I went through Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan over the, you know, over the Kiber Pass and then
00:28:34.24 --> 00:28:39.28 and all of that, you know, I was fascinated by the stories of Victorian exploration,
00:28:39.28 --> 00:28:45.44 great game, particularly in Central Asia. Afghanistan was very much on my radar then because
00:28:46.64 --> 00:28:50.40 the Brachomia just sort of made deployments in Kabul. It hadn't, things hadn't really
00:28:50.40 --> 00:28:55.44 kicked off in the south yet at the stage but so it was probably a fairly, you know, safe as it gets
00:28:55.44 --> 00:29:01.76 an Afghanistan to go traveling there. But that was a journey I really really wanted to do and
00:29:01.76 --> 00:29:07.28 and so yeah, if I went and again very similar thing, I just went with a small day sack.
00:29:07.28 --> 00:29:13.52 I had no money, I had total of 500 pounds in my bank account. There was the all those left
00:29:13.52 --> 00:29:18.000 from my student loan and I thought I'll see how far I can get and it took five months. So I was
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.60 just, you were eating? Well, a lot of 500 pounds feeds me for like a day and a half. It does,
00:29:23.60 --> 00:29:28.16 it does mean now. But the hell are you eating? So not very much, I was pretty skinny.
00:29:29.28 --> 00:29:34.64 So yeah, I was, I was just, I kind of, maybe I was a bit reckless but I was just really
00:29:34.64 --> 00:29:42.48 pulling my faith in human nature. So I hitchhiked the whole way. Usually whoever I was hitchhiking
00:29:42.48 --> 00:29:47.28 with, you know, I was 21 right. So people look, and when you tell them what you're doing,
00:29:47.28 --> 00:29:51.92 they think you're either mad or they feel sorry for you. And off the back of that, I got
00:29:51.92 --> 00:29:57.44 invicing to people's homes, you know, I met lots of girls that were here. But people look after you
00:29:57.44 --> 00:30:02.96 and often they would stuff $10 into your pocket on the way out or fill your bag with apples or
00:30:02.96 --> 00:30:06.80 whatever it might be. So I think actually came about with more than I started with. Okay, so I'm
00:30:06.80 --> 00:30:12.000 starting to think, I'm starting to feel like maybe things are different in life for you and me.
00:30:13.28 --> 00:30:18.16 I'm just saying, maybe you're a sweet looking guy and I'm not. The last time somebody tried to
00:30:18.16 --> 00:30:24.08 slip me $10 was never. You think I get invited into people's homes? That doesn't happen.
00:30:25.44 --> 00:30:29.04 So you're, you're living a charm to life. I'm over here. I feel like the world might have
00:30:29.04 --> 00:30:36.32 been against me this whole time. If I put my thumb out as you did, there's no one's going to pick
00:30:36.32 --> 00:30:39.20 me up. Zero. The percentage of people that picked me up is zero.
00:30:40.80 --> 00:30:44.24 Yeah, I wouldn't happen these days for me. I don't think. I think it's definitely a thing
00:30:44.24 --> 00:30:49.68 when you're younger. It's it's formal like it. To happen. I don't think I would. How many pairs of pants
00:30:49.68 --> 00:30:54.48 are you bringing with you? I went fully light scales. I like to use brand the pants of your wife.
00:30:54.48 --> 00:31:02.80 I had one pair of pants, a couple of shirts. That's it, really. It was great. The freedom,
00:31:02.80 --> 00:31:07.60 the liberation of it all. It was brilliant. I was just sleeping at the side of the road. I had
00:31:07.60 --> 00:31:13.28 one poncho. Sorry, I had a bivvy bag. I had a ground pad. I didn't even have a ground pad.
00:31:13.28 --> 00:31:19.20 I was just, if somebody didn't invite me into that home, I would just sleep on it. I mean,
00:31:19.20 --> 00:31:23.28 in Russia, I remember sleeping in the middle of this roundabout because it was a busy city.
00:31:23.28 --> 00:31:27.44 There was nowhere to stay. I couldn't speak a word of the language. I just found this roundabout.
00:31:27.44 --> 00:31:35.92 It was a really gray industrial area. It was quite cold. It was a roundabout. I saw some
00:31:35.92 --> 00:31:41.28 top-end plastic sheeting as a perfect. This was going to keep me dry because it was about to rain.
00:31:41.28 --> 00:31:46.24 Gunned this top-end. I heard some rustling. I thought I should have shittled some rats in there.
00:31:46.24 --> 00:31:51.28 I looked underneath. There was actually two other homeless people sleeping under this
00:31:51.28 --> 00:31:57.92 bag. It had to move from there. It was sort of experiences like that. I looked back and
00:31:57.92 --> 00:32:04.40 think, what I thought was like doing. At the time, it felt like it was a big ground adventure.
00:32:04.40 --> 00:32:10.88 Again, what did you eat? Whatever I can get my hands on. I was usually one meal a day.
00:32:10.88 --> 00:32:17.84 I tried to budget it so I had three dollars or whatever per day to spend on food. In a ran, I remember
00:32:17.84 --> 00:32:27.12 I ran out of money in a ran. I think I had five dollars left. I knew I needed to pay for a visa
00:32:27.12 --> 00:32:33.20 at the Afghan border. Not only had I had my money in a ran, but I was going into Afghanistan completely
00:32:33.20 --> 00:32:38.96 penniless. I had it like one traveler's check, but you can't change any sort of Western traveler's
00:32:38.96 --> 00:32:45.60 checks in a ran because there was a big embargo on all that stuff. I remember staying. I went to
00:32:45.60 --> 00:32:51.28 this small hotel in the middle of the desert and explained to this. The Iranians of lovely people,
00:32:51.28 --> 00:32:55.44 and they're very, very hospitable. Everyone else had looked after me, but in this particular place,
00:32:55.44 --> 00:32:59.68 there was more than the Russians that had let you sleep in the free place. What are our
00:32:59.68 --> 00:33:03.20 damn? That restored my faith in Russians because I'm like the Russians didn't help you. Come on.
00:33:03.20 --> 00:33:07.76 No, they did. Honestly, I was like, it was tough for a Russian than a lot of places.
00:33:07.76 --> 00:33:14.24 Thank you. It was definitely, you know, going across the border into Georgia was great because
00:33:14.24 --> 00:33:20.16 there was a start difference there. So you're rolling to wear it in Iran? Well, I mean, a place
00:33:20.16 --> 00:33:25.60 called Mashad, which is a big holy city on the near the Afghan border, nowhere to stay. And I found
00:33:25.60 --> 00:33:31.28 this one hotel, like a motel thing, and I explained to this guy, said, look, can I have a room? I've got
00:33:31.28 --> 00:33:34.88 five dollars, but I really need three dollars to get the Afghan stamp because it was that so much
00:33:34.88 --> 00:33:39.20 of gossip. He said, look, you can stay for free on my office floor and I said, if you got any food,
00:33:39.20 --> 00:33:43.52 he said, no, there's no food, but I noticed there was a wedding sort of party happening. He said,
00:33:43.52 --> 00:33:48.24 just going to help yourself to the leftovers. So score. You know, there's always a way, there's always
00:33:48.24 --> 00:33:54.32 a way. But yeah, I ended up in Afghanistan, literally, no money. But I knew I'd been told that the
00:33:54.32 --> 00:33:59.76 Afghans are pretty hospitable. And they were, I mean, it's to sort of hitchhike across the whole country
00:33:59.76 --> 00:34:05.28 through her rat. I went through the central mountains through Chadsharan, Bamiyan, and an end up in
00:34:05.28 --> 00:34:09.52 Kabul. How are you as a kind, being able to cash that traveler's check? How are you overcome
00:34:09.52 --> 00:34:16.32 in the language barrier? By hand signals. I mean, I had a pretty good bid at that stage. So
00:34:17.12 --> 00:34:21.36 the places that I was traveling to were ethnically tragic because I was, I'd got a pretty good
00:34:21.36 --> 00:34:24.88 town of the beard. Everyone thought I was a pastor and so they all, they all sort of kept the distance
00:34:24.88 --> 00:34:29.84 because they thought it was a Taliban. But as a result, they were quite, you know, they kind of looked
00:34:29.84 --> 00:34:37.60 after me and, yeah, it was fine. And then where did that trip end? That ended in India. So maybe
00:34:37.60 --> 00:34:42.000 it through Afghanistan, always be Pakistan and then finally made it to the beach and go where I
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.40 sort of shaved the beard off and finally had a beard and celebrated still being alive.
00:34:50.64 --> 00:34:56.000 Once again, I'm over here, look, I got four kids. And my opinion is don't try this at home.
00:34:56.64 --> 00:35:00.72 I'm glad you did it. I'm glad you're telling me about it. I'm not encouraged you people to
00:35:00.72 --> 00:35:06.48 necessarily be the same. No, actually you wrote an entire book telling people to do this stuff. So
00:35:06.48 --> 00:35:12.96 I'm going to disagree with you. It comes with a disclaimer. All right, speaking the book,
00:35:12.96 --> 00:35:16.40 I'm going to go back to the book here for a second because at some point,
00:35:19.04 --> 00:35:25.52 well, before I jump into that, you, you, you, you get into Sanhurst. So what's the deal with Sanhurst?
00:35:25.52 --> 00:35:29.68 Sanhurst is not like West Point where you go there and you go to college for four years.
00:35:29.68 --> 00:35:35.04 No, Sanhurst is 12 months pretty much. That's 44 weeks. Spread over here.
00:35:35.04 --> 00:35:40.40 You, it tends to be mainly graduates, so people who've finished university,
00:35:40.96 --> 00:35:44.64 but there is, you know, it is open to people who haven't necessarily been to university.
00:35:45.44 --> 00:35:50.88 And you spend 12 months or then you commission into whichever regiments or call that you,
00:35:50.88 --> 00:35:54.24 that you choose to join. And how hard is it to get in the Sanhurst?
00:35:54.88 --> 00:35:59.92 Tough. Yeah, very tough. I started my application process. I think I was 17 when I went
00:35:59.92 --> 00:36:06.000 into the career's office with my dad. You then do the, what was then known as the Regimental,
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.24 sorry, the RCB. Basically, the selection in Sanhurst, so you have to go to a place called West
00:36:12.24 --> 00:36:18.08 Bre where you do all these sort of command tasks, lots of interviews, mental arithmetic,
00:36:18.08 --> 00:36:22.24 all this sort of stuff where you're tested for your aptitude and your personality. A lot of
00:36:22.24 --> 00:36:27.04 it's about leadership, but showing that not necessarily having experience in leadership, but the
00:36:27.04 --> 00:36:31.68 potential to develop your leadership. Is there any other ways to get your commission
00:36:32.80 --> 00:36:37.04 besides going like in America, you can go to West Point or the Naval Academy or whatever,
00:36:37.04 --> 00:36:42.64 or you can go to ROTC, which is you go to college while you're taking classes about whatever
00:36:42.64 --> 00:36:47.04 branch you're going into, or you can do Officer Canada School. So there's, or you can be a
00:36:47.04 --> 00:36:52.000 prior and listed guy. Yep. And you can get commissioned. How does it work in England? So all offices
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.88 have to go to Sanhurst. Even if you'd done O's, I was an O's, you see whilst at university, so I did
00:36:56.88 --> 00:37:01.44 three years there. Is it a different school for that army versus the Navy? Yes, so this three,
00:37:01.44 --> 00:37:06.88 so Sanhurst is for the Army, then you've got one down at Portsmouth Fort for the Navy,
00:37:06.88 --> 00:37:12.08 and then you've got Crown World, which is for the Royal Air Force. Yeah. But you're gonna go,
00:37:12.08 --> 00:37:15.44 if you're gonna get a commission, that's what you're doing. I want, yeah exactly, you've got to go
00:37:15.44 --> 00:37:20.88 Sanhurst. And so for me, it was quite, I'd heard about it, my dad had encouraged me, he didn't
00:37:20.88 --> 00:37:28.32 get into Sanhurst. He wanted to join his as a reservist back in the 70s, didn't work out for him.
00:37:28.32 --> 00:37:32.32 So I felt like I was, and my grandfather was, you know, he was an elicited private soldier,
00:37:32.32 --> 00:37:37.52 so there was no history of officership within my family, although I think there were five
00:37:37.52 --> 00:37:43.36 generations of soldiers previously, so we'd all served him one way or another. So to go to Sanhurst
00:37:43.36 --> 00:37:48.000 was a real privilege, but also a big challenge, because there was, it was quite a daunting prospect,
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.64 you know, I was from a pretty normal background, and then suddenly I was in the same
00:37:50.64 --> 00:37:56.88 platoon as Prince Harry. So I was, you know, surrounded by a totally different type of people
00:37:56.88 --> 00:38:02.40 that I hadn't necessarily met before. Lots of people who'd been big in sports who'd gone to
00:38:02.40 --> 00:38:08.48 a very prestigious universities, but I could say it's about leadership and demonstrating the
00:38:08.48 --> 00:38:13.68 potential to be an officer. Now let's jump into the book.
00:38:13.68 --> 00:38:20.72 Um, I passed the Army's commissioning board, which meant I could join his officer and command
00:38:20.72 --> 00:38:26.32 men, something I found both exciting and daunting. A young officer's training takes place at the
00:38:26.32 --> 00:38:31.92 Royal Military Academy Sanhurst, and when I arrived there age 23, I still wasn't sure where I
00:38:31.92 --> 00:38:38.24 wanted to end up. After visiting as many units as they want to see where they might fit in,
00:38:38.24 --> 00:38:46.08 officer cadets can select two regiments to have interviews within their final term. So before you
00:38:46.08 --> 00:38:51.04 go to Sanhurst, you go and meet with various units to see which ones you like. Yeah, you do think
00:38:51.04 --> 00:38:56.000 cool is that? You do these sort of familiarization visits, and they can be as formal or informal as
00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.88 the regiment chooses. So, you know, a lot of the cavalry units, which are known to attract quite
00:39:01.60 --> 00:39:06.88 posh well to do officers, they just go on a drinking bench for a weekend. Over units, you know,
00:39:06.88 --> 00:39:12.88 the engineers or the artillery do slightly more, you know, craft-focused exercises. The
00:39:12.88 --> 00:39:17.28 powers I didn't, I wasn't, I didn't look into the powers at this stage. So I, I got to visit my
00:39:17.28 --> 00:39:21.92 local unit, the Stafford's, I looked at the Gurkers, and I went to look at the intelligence
00:39:21.92 --> 00:39:26.32 course. So you go, you basically go and have a look around, see if it's the right fit for you,
00:39:26.32 --> 00:39:29.52 and it's a two-way thing they might not like you, and so you don't come back.
00:39:31.36 --> 00:39:36.48 So now you show up at Sanhurst, back to the book Sanhurst was hard work, and the late nights,
00:39:36.48 --> 00:39:41.28 ironing my uniforms, the parades, and long-accadeping assay, academic assays were only part of it.
00:39:41.28 --> 00:39:45.04 There was a lot of running marching and being shouted at along with field exercises,
00:39:45.04 --> 00:39:50.000 rifle ranges, and blowing things up as well as learning the more subtle arts of our officership,
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.72 fancy dinners, the intricacies of letter writing, and knowing the debrets guide to etiquette inside
00:39:56.72 --> 00:40:02.56 and out. It was an interesting and varied education, the debrets guide to etiquette.
00:40:02.56 --> 00:40:06.08 Yeah, I, I didn't know, this wasn't, I don't know what it is right now.
00:40:06.08 --> 00:40:09.84 So it's basically a manual of how to behave like a proper gentleman.
00:40:11.44 --> 00:40:15.60 Give us one example. Well, it's, you know, it's, I mean, the basics of, you know,
00:40:15.60 --> 00:40:20.32 if you're going to a seven-course meal, it's like which, which knife and fork do you start with first?
00:40:20.32 --> 00:40:25.44 Yeah. It's how to write, you know, if you're writing a letter to a member of the Royal Family,
00:40:25.44 --> 00:40:30.72 how do you address them? So when I, I would to officer candidate school, and this is only
00:40:30.72 --> 00:40:36.40 13 weeks long. So you, but you do get etiquette training. I believe the only thing I remember,
00:40:36.40 --> 00:40:39.84 this is a weird thing to remember. Echo Charles take notes. This could be important.
00:40:40.72 --> 00:40:45.68 Because I, it surprised me. If you get a piece of food in your mouth that you didn't want in there,
00:40:46.40 --> 00:40:51.36 the proper way to get it out of your mouth is to put it back on the fork and put it down.
00:40:52.40 --> 00:40:56.72 So in other words, if you, if you're eating a piece of chicken and there's a bone in there,
00:40:56.72 --> 00:41:03.68 you don't pull it out with your, with your hand. You, you put it back on the fork and you put it down.
00:41:03.68 --> 00:41:08.40 Now I think it's a lot more subtle to, you know, put the hand up. My face grab that thing.
00:41:08.40 --> 00:41:12.56 I'm like, no, I'm never going to know what I just did. As opposed to spitting the food back on the fork.
00:41:12.56 --> 00:41:16.32 Right? That's kind of, yeah. But hey, that's the tradition. That, that the rules.
00:41:16.32 --> 00:41:24.40 But that, so in regards to that, what if, so it has to be something like a bone, like,
00:41:24.40 --> 00:41:29.04 hey, I, I'm a piece of gristle, you're eating this steak and there's a piece of gristle that ain't going down.
00:41:29.04 --> 00:41:33.28 Yeah. What are we going to do? Put the fork back next to your mouth. This is a legit look.
00:41:33.28 --> 00:41:37.68 I'm not, I'm not even following this protocol. Because I think that's a lot nastier.
00:41:37.68 --> 00:41:42.80 I'll clan destine move. You won't know what happened. But that gristle is coming into my hand.
00:41:42.80 --> 00:41:46.40 It's going to be somewhere on the ground. Make sense. But what if,
00:41:46.40 --> 00:41:50.96 and this might go outside of the scope of even what you're talking about, what if you eat some chicken,
00:41:50.96 --> 00:41:55.36 that's like dry or like, well, you know, some new food like an S-car go or something like this.
00:41:55.36 --> 00:41:59.76 And you're like, oh, first time. Did you start liking it? I don't like this at all. Do you spit the whole
00:41:59.76 --> 00:42:05.44 S-car go on the fork? Or we have to go. Well, I have to consult the Nebraska.
00:42:05.44 --> 00:42:09.92 Oh, you said that's a good bread guide for, I don't know what to do. I think you're in a tough spot.
00:42:09.92 --> 00:42:14.64 Yeah. I had that happen. I was, I don't like seafood. And I was with, I was in
00:42:14.64 --> 00:42:24.48 Sierra Leone. And I was, there was stuff going on down there. And I was with my commanding officer.
00:42:24.48 --> 00:42:27.44 And there was like I said, there were things going on. We were trying to figure things out.
00:42:28.16 --> 00:42:32.000 So we get invited. And I was like, it's a little sidekick guy. I was a priori and
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.96 listen guy. But I was, had been commissioned as an officer. And he was just
00:42:36.32 --> 00:42:41.20 really taken care of me and showed me the ropes. And so he gets invited to go see the
00:42:41.20 --> 00:42:47.28 charge da fairs, which is the number two underneath the ambassador in the country. Unless there's
00:42:47.28 --> 00:42:51.68 no ambassador in which case they're, they're the, the bleed. And in this particular case, there was no
00:42:51.68 --> 00:42:56.24 ambassador. So this individual was the lead. So we roll up. And this isn't Sierra Leone. There's a
00:42:56.24 --> 00:43:02.32 freaking war going on there. The Ekomog versus all that craziness is happening in Liberia. It's just,
00:43:02.32 --> 00:43:08.56 it just mayhem down in Africa. So we roll up to this like really nice house and every there's
00:43:08.56 --> 00:43:13.12 servants in the whole nine yards. And the first thing they put in front of me is some kind of crazy
00:43:13.12 --> 00:43:22.000 like, just like, like, you mean like, no, it's like octopus shrimp and like raw fish all in one thing.
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.24 Yeah. And I'm trying to do what I remembered from, you know, adequate, which is you eat whatever,
00:43:28.24 --> 00:43:32.96 you know, they're putting something front of you. They went the distance. And so on, I was just,
00:43:32.96 --> 00:43:39.28 I sucked it up, bro. I did it for the good of the mission for the good of the YouTube. All right.
00:43:40.32 --> 00:43:45.52 Little detour there back to the book. I also took a boxing. Everyone had to be part of a sports club
00:43:45.52 --> 00:43:49.84 at Sanhurst. And I wasn't into rugby or rowing boxing seemed like a decent choice.
00:43:49.84 --> 00:43:56.16 Initially, I hated the 430 AM starts. But as fitness started to, as the fitness started to impact on me
00:43:56.16 --> 00:44:01.12 and I felt myself improving. I came to relish the early morning alarm calls. Plus there was the
00:44:01.12 --> 00:44:06.80 added carrot of the annual fight night in which the most dedicated committed boxers were chosen
00:44:06.80 --> 00:44:12.80 to fight, watched by the whole academy as well as the string of generals, politicians, and VIP guests.
00:44:13.60 --> 00:44:18.96 I was incredibly proud to be chosen as one of those fighters. And on 9 November 2005, I stood in the
00:44:18.96 --> 00:44:24.56 ring surrounded by over 1,000 people face to face with officer candidate, Mortimer.
00:44:25.60 --> 00:44:30.56 I won the fight by knocking my opponent to the ground, but I'm not retelling the story to discuss
00:44:30.56 --> 00:44:35.68 the win. I had a huge respect for my opponent and the opportunity that came next to a road simply
00:44:35.68 --> 00:44:41.76 from having stood in the arena. After the fight, all the boxers were invited to the sergeant's
00:44:41.76 --> 00:44:47.04 mess. A club of sorts, where many of our training instructors lived. This was a huge honor because
00:44:47.04 --> 00:44:51.28 it was because this particular mess was usually out of bounds and the sergeants themselves were
00:44:51.28 --> 00:44:58.16 only seen in their context as authoritarian figures, all muscles, tattoos, and shaved heads.
00:44:58.16 --> 00:45:02.72 The fact that we privilege few were allowed into their private domain was viewed with absolute
00:45:02.72 --> 00:45:08.40 envy by the other cadets. The sergeants crowded round the fighters and congratulated us all
00:45:08.40 --> 00:45:14.08 on our performance, victors and defeated alike. As I finished my second pint of beer, I found another
00:45:14.08 --> 00:45:20.08 one thrust into my hand. Looking up, I saw it was capped and true it. The sandhurt representative
00:45:20.08 --> 00:45:26.56 of the parachute regiment. Congratulations, Wood, which regiment are you joining? He said,
00:45:26.56 --> 00:45:32.32 sternly, I hesitated momentarily before applying. I'm not sure sir. I was looking at the staffers
00:45:32.32 --> 00:45:39.52 or the int corp. So until. Saw that, he said, you should join the Paris. My look of surprise must have
00:45:39.52 --> 00:45:45.28 been quite apparent. The Paris were the most fearsome soldiers in the British Army. I'm not good enough
00:45:45.28 --> 00:45:50.000 to get in the Paris, I thought you needed to be a muscle bound machine to get in. It wasn't even
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.96 all my radar. Sit down the captain barked. I sat on one of the little stools by the bar,
00:45:54.96 --> 00:45:58.16 beer still in hand. First two rounds of interviews have already been done. He told me,
00:45:58.80 --> 00:46:03.12 we had over a hundred applicants and now we're down to 20. I don't do this very often and I won't
00:46:03.12 --> 00:46:08.96 ask you twice, but do you want to interview? I sobered up pretty quickly. My entire future
00:46:08.96 --> 00:46:14.24 rested in the balance and all sorts of thoughts crossed my mind. What about the staffers? They
00:46:14.24 --> 00:46:18.80 seem like a nice enough bunch and the intelligence corp. They did some interesting, spy-related work.
00:46:18.80 --> 00:46:22.64 It could be a good start to my career, which would allow me to travel too. When it came to the
00:46:22.64 --> 00:46:27.44 Paris, there were a lot of unknowns. As a regiment, they are shrouded in mystery and are considered
00:46:27.44 --> 00:46:31.68 to be one of the countries if not the world's most elite military units. I didn't know what to
00:46:31.68 --> 00:46:36.24 expect and I didn't think I was capable of joining their ranks. The temptation was to play it safe
00:46:36.24 --> 00:46:42.32 and stick with a more achievable goal. I knew what I was getting into with the staffers.
00:46:43.68 --> 00:46:47.36 If I agreed to an interview with the Paris, I would automatically have to turn down one of the
00:46:47.36 --> 00:46:52.000 other options since you can only interview with two regiments and the Paris had the toughest selection
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:58.56 of all just peaking the intelligence corp. If I turned down the staffers and failed the board
00:46:58.56 --> 00:47:03.36 for the others, I ran the risk of not getting any of my choices. I could end up being a blanket
00:47:03.36 --> 00:47:07.84 stacker in logistics corp for the rest of my career. The captain was staring at me.
00:47:09.44 --> 00:47:14.40 I'd like to interview Sir. I told him expecting that it would take place in the coming weeks.
00:47:14.40 --> 00:47:18.48 Nope. Captain Truitt launched into a formal interview right there at the bar,
00:47:18.48 --> 00:47:24.000 grilling me about my own motivations experiences, education and skills. On other 15 after another
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.20 15 minutes he stood up, shook my hand and told me to report to his office at 6 a.m. the next morning.
00:47:29.60 --> 00:47:35.44 And that's what I did hang over in all. I was fast tracked to the final eight and then at the
00:47:35.44 --> 00:47:39.60 last interview with a panel headed by some of the most senior figures in the British Army.
00:47:39.60 --> 00:47:49.76 I was offered a place in the Parisian Regiment. That's how I got into the Paris.
00:47:52.40 --> 00:47:56.56 Yeah. I mean, in hindsight it's those little moments isn't it?
00:47:56.56 --> 00:48:01.52 That can change your entire the course of your life and it was that drunken moment in a bar
00:48:02.32 --> 00:48:07.60 that boxing is what got me in and that's probably if I hadn't had joined the Paris,
00:48:07.60 --> 00:48:11.44 there's no way I would have been able to do half the stuff I've done since then.
00:48:11.44 --> 00:48:16.88 Let alone have the confidence to go and spend ten years exploring the world.
00:48:16.88 --> 00:48:20.08 So I'm glad I took it up and I'm glad I took the risk.
00:48:21.60 --> 00:48:25.28 And you made that decision and split you literally hadn't thought about the Paris at all.
00:48:25.28 --> 00:48:26.88 I haven't even been on my radar.
00:48:28.48 --> 00:48:34.08 And you fought maybe you weren't quite capable of doing it. Is that what kept it off your radar?
00:48:34.08 --> 00:48:40.24 I think until that point, I mentioned there the Staffordshire Regiment which was my local
00:48:40.24 --> 00:48:46.000 regiment and the intelligence corps which was very difficult to get into more from an intellectual
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:52.08 capability. So I felt that in having the the ink corps that was going to that was quite a big
00:48:52.08 --> 00:48:57.52 risk. The Staffordshire was slightly more guaranteed in many respects. So the Paris, you know,
00:48:57.52 --> 00:49:02.24 like I say, I'm not the sort of biggest muscle bound guy in the world and looking around
00:49:02.24 --> 00:49:06.24 at some of the other guys that had been in the Paris, there's quite a there's quite an aggressive
00:49:06.24 --> 00:49:11.28 mentality to get in there and and like I said, there was a hundred applicants for only six
00:49:11.28 --> 00:49:17.44 places in the end. So no, it hadn't been on my radar but I think the boxing which had encouraged
00:49:17.44 --> 00:49:22.88 me to just have a bit more confidence is what did it for me. So at that and then the the
00:49:22.88 --> 00:49:27.36 probably the drinks I'd have for the in the bar at the time. If you were to say no, he'd
00:49:27.36 --> 00:49:32.32 hand it to another shot. Probably. Do you keep in touch with this guy? Yeah. He's got freaking
00:49:32.32 --> 00:49:36.48 change your life. He did. Yeah. He actually he sent me a message on LinkedIn the other day which
00:49:36.48 --> 00:49:40.16 is quite a coincidence because it's not heard from him for for quite a number of years and I
00:49:40.16 --> 00:49:44.72 mentioned that he was going to go in my book and he said, why? I said, well, actually so you
00:49:44.72 --> 00:49:49.60 were it was you that I can thank for all of all of what's happened. And then what about the guy
00:49:49.60 --> 00:49:53.44 that found your wallet? Naces guy ever. I've tried to track him down. I can't find him anyway.
00:49:53.44 --> 00:49:59.20 One day I'll send him a nice letter back. Yeah, it's just a good reminder to people to
00:49:59.20 --> 00:50:04.08 everybody. You know, you have the opportunity to like completely change people's lives and
00:50:04.08 --> 00:50:10.72 and just by doing something cool and nice and freaking those those guys. I mean, first of all,
00:50:10.72 --> 00:50:16.48 giving you your wallet back and your money, that's kind of crazy. But then just giving you all
00:50:16.48 --> 00:50:21.92 a six-page essay on how to move forward and and you know what's look not everyone's going to
00:50:21.92 --> 00:50:26.32 take you up on your advice, right? And you give people advice all the time and you might get sick of
00:50:26.32 --> 00:50:30.40 doing it and you think, well, it's not worth it. But you change one person's life and you're a
00:50:30.40 --> 00:50:40.000 perfect example of that of your world changing because these momentary decisions and momentary
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:46.24 mentorship from people. It's unbelievable. It's awesome. I mean, let's get to the pair as a little bit,
00:50:46.24 --> 00:50:50.96 going back to the book to join the parachute regimen candidates must undergo a tough selection
00:50:50.96 --> 00:50:57.92 process called pre-paracute selection run by Pegasus company, which is usually referred to as
00:50:57.92 --> 00:51:05.44 Pico. Pico company. Yeah. Based at the Infantry Training Center in Cadric, North Yorkshire,
00:51:05.44 --> 00:51:11.52 after 21 weeks of training candidates are put through a test to design, to test the resilience and
00:51:11.52 --> 00:51:18.000 determination, including a 20 mile endurance, March, late in with a 16 kilogram pack and a rifle in
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.36 under four hours and 10 minutes and intimidating assault course, which is what you guys call
00:51:23.36 --> 00:51:28.08 obstacle courses. How many of you do call them assault courses, too? Let's go with the Salt Sounds
00:51:28.08 --> 00:51:38.000 Way, Coulok. 17 meters above the ground called the train azium. And 60 seconds of milling.
00:51:38.88 --> 00:51:44.72 Milling arguably the flagship event of parachute selection is a boxing match between candidates
00:51:44.72 --> 00:51:50.000 of similar size and strength in which determination and aggression are awarded and dodging and blocking
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:57.04 lose points. In short, it amounts to being punched hard in the head for a minute straight while
00:51:57.04 --> 00:52:02.16 trying to hit the other guy as much and as hard as possible. If either combatting sheds blood or
00:52:02.16 --> 00:52:08.48 knocked to the floor, the clock is paused, blood wiped off and about resumes. It is forbidden to aim at
00:52:08.48 --> 00:52:15.44 any part of the opponent's body besides the head and the winner is the most aggressive candidate.
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:22.48 Milling is designed specifically to replicate, quote, the conditions of stress and personal
00:52:22.48 --> 00:52:29.36 qualities required in a combat situation and test quote determination and raw fighting spirit
00:52:30.16 --> 00:52:35.68 of the candidates. It is this raw spirit of controlled aggression that sets pairs apart from the
00:52:35.68 --> 00:52:41.68 rest of the army. Good times. Yeah. How do you go to YouTube on that?
00:52:41.68 --> 00:52:46.16 I just want to see Milling. It's pretty cool. It's freaking legit. It's freaking legit.
00:52:46.16 --> 00:52:51.04 Just go as hard as you can. It's such a huge audience. You're on a delta-rated aggression punching
00:52:51.04 --> 00:52:55.20 straight to the head. You can't back off. You can't turn away. If you turn away, that's you.
00:52:55.20 --> 00:52:59.52 If you screw you in tight career, it's all based on that worm movement, especially as an officer.
00:52:59.52 --> 00:53:04.72 If you show any weakness, if you if you cow her away, you won't get in the
00:53:04.72 --> 00:53:08.48 regiment. So you can have spent months doing all the other training. You can have passed all the
00:53:08.48 --> 00:53:13.12 interviews, done the test. I know guys that spent six months who were perfectly capable of doing
00:53:13.12 --> 00:53:16.80 everything else and then they were just a bit weak on the milling. That was them done.
00:53:16.80 --> 00:53:20.80 Do they actually fail? Yeah. And you're not in. And then you're not in. Then you'll get sent some
00:53:20.80 --> 00:53:28.72 more else. Did you have to like rearrange your brain from your boxing training to not
00:53:28.72 --> 00:53:34.16 you know, peri and slets very different. Yeah. Because I would think your instinct would be you'd be
00:53:34.16 --> 00:53:38.80 slipping and moving and head movement and everything that you've learned to be a good
00:53:38.80 --> 00:53:43.52 boxer. You have to throw out the win. And there's no training for milling. The only event that you do,
00:53:43.52 --> 00:53:48.96 you don't practice this at all. The first time most of the blocks actually mill is on their tests.
00:53:48.96 --> 00:53:54.16 So you're you're giving your gloves and you're told the rules and you just go ahead.
00:53:54.16 --> 00:53:58.96 I mean it's a great spectator's ball. Yeah, this is definitely a busy behavior for sure.
00:53:58.96 --> 00:54:04.80 It's everything like that the UFC wants. Right? Just punch each other as much as you possibly
00:54:04.80 --> 00:54:10.16 freaking hand. How often do you guys get knocked out? A lot. Yeah. Like it's every other one.
00:54:10.16 --> 00:54:13.84 This guy's going down. I mean it's it's pretty full on. I mean, especially the officers.
00:54:13.84 --> 00:54:18.48 Because you're in with the the enlisted guys as well. So there's probably, they're saying
00:54:18.48 --> 00:54:23.44 90 enlisted guys and like I say six officers and they always with the officers. I mentioned in
00:54:23.44 --> 00:54:27.84 there that you're usually put up against the person of your own size and weight. Officers,
00:54:27.84 --> 00:54:32.000 that's not true. They put you up against the biggest guy out there. So I was up against this
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.04 this huge guy and it's all you take your top soft. It's all done. You know, so you can really
00:54:37.04 --> 00:54:43.60 get the full the full experience. And I was up against this huge guy and I was absolutely terrified.
00:54:44.48 --> 00:54:48.08 Probably because I'd already had my boxing match show, you know, it's handhurt and which I'd
00:54:48.08 --> 00:54:54.80 once I was quite proud of myself undefeated one. One would win. And then to go milling where you're surrounded
00:54:54.80 --> 00:55:01.44 by not only your future brother officers, but also, you know, dozens of men that you will go on
00:55:01.44 --> 00:55:06.48 to command. They're all watching you. All their eyes are on you. So you know, you've got to put
00:55:06.48 --> 00:55:12.72 on a bit of an act, a brave face of course, but you don't want to lose. And thankfully I did win.
00:55:12.72 --> 00:55:16.80 And it was only afterwards. I mean, I was I got a lucky punch and not to be guy out, but it was only
00:55:16.80 --> 00:55:21.36 it was only afterwards that he came up to me. He'd much told me much bigger than me and he was
00:55:21.36 --> 00:55:25.92 like good fight. So he said, I'll be honest. I was terrified of sight. He's serious. Like I'm literally
00:55:25.92 --> 00:55:30.56 half your sight. He said, you were the same person. But, G-C, well, no, he just said, you're a parachute
00:55:30.56 --> 00:55:34.64 region officer. I was never going to win against that. And I think that it's the mindset
00:55:34.64 --> 00:55:39.84 is an mentality. And so he was bizarrely, it was nothing to do with physical presence. It was
00:55:39.84 --> 00:55:43.92 far more against, you know, it's just that what's going on in your mind. And for him, it was to
00:55:43.92 --> 00:55:49.68 be up against an officer was was was a big thing. Damn, they played that game in the seal. So
00:55:50.56 --> 00:55:55.44 you give the young e-dogs, it's shot at the title and gets off through that officer better. Hey,
00:55:55.44 --> 00:56:00.48 no, I was just going to bring it. The other cool thing is I was watching the videos. It's like
00:56:01.28 --> 00:56:05.92 basically the ring is formed from the crowd. Yeah. And it's small. What is it? It's probably looks like
00:56:05.92 --> 00:56:08.80 like you don't move it. You don't move your feet. You don't move your feet. You're just
00:56:08.80 --> 00:56:18.88 stay still. I got a good dive. How much did you wear at the? I was probably 80, 75 kilo, 80
00:56:18.88 --> 00:56:25.60 kilograms. Yeah. What are you challenging it? I'll leave now.
00:56:25.60 --> 00:56:34.08 Really. Going back to the book, nothing worth having comes easy. And we will need to work hard
00:56:34.08 --> 00:56:38.80 to achieve things that we want most out of life. Whether this is learning a new skill or advancement
00:56:38.80 --> 00:56:42.32 in our professional careers, we need to be prepared to stay the course and keep working to our
00:56:42.32 --> 00:56:46.88 goals. No matter which obstacles appear along the way, when I was on my way into the parachute
00:56:46.88 --> 00:56:52.88 regimen, I busped up to cataract for my pre parachute selection. At that point, I had no idea
00:56:52.88 --> 00:56:57.04 what the next 20 or so weeks would look like for me. All I knew was that they would be the most
00:56:57.04 --> 00:57:02.56 stressful demanding challenging of my life so far. But I had a goal in mind. I was determined to
00:57:02.56 --> 00:57:09.28 earn that purple buret at the end. The recognition of my achievement and my initiation into one of
00:57:09.28 --> 00:57:15.52 the world's elite fighting regiments. That level of drive is absolutely crucial. We can't give our
00:57:15.52 --> 00:57:21.28 all to anything if we're not motivated by the end result. And if we're not giving our all,
00:57:21.28 --> 00:57:25.92 we've no chance of sticking things through when the going gets tough. Over the first few weeks of
00:57:25.92 --> 00:57:30.40 selection, it was pretty clear that a lot of people didn't have what it took. Some couldn't handle
00:57:30.40 --> 00:57:34.72 the rigors of training and fell behind. Others decided that enough was enough and dropped out of
00:57:34.72 --> 00:57:40.88 their own accord midway through. I had my own moment. When I fought my time on selection was up.
00:57:40.88 --> 00:57:46.16 I came down with a shin injury that sent me back behind the rest of my cohort for a few days.
00:57:46.16 --> 00:57:50.64 I'm able to join in the rigorous drills and knowing that when I was back in action, things would
00:57:50.64 --> 00:57:56.24 be exponentially tougher for the time I'd missed. I'd wondered if this was worth it.
00:57:56.24 --> 00:58:01.84 I started thinking about what my life would be like if I failed selection. Probably not all that
00:58:01.84 --> 00:58:08.40 bad. I could probably go and reapply to one of the armies other more sedate regiments than what.
00:58:08.40 --> 00:58:12.80 Have a fairly average military career. Perhaps go on some go to some interesting places and do
00:58:12.80 --> 00:58:19.04 some interesting things. But nothing grabbed me about it. Even more so when I considered a life
00:58:19.04 --> 00:58:24.72 and career outside the army, having just passed out of sandhurst, I couldn't for a moment contemplate
00:58:24.72 --> 00:58:30.16 the prospect of a civilian life. All I wanted was that maroon beret. They kept appearing in front
00:58:30.16 --> 00:58:35.12 of me every time I closed my eyes in a way it would have taken some motivation to present myself to
00:58:35.12 --> 00:58:40.16 one of the officer's running selection and tell them that I wanted to drop out that I couldn't do it.
00:58:40.96 --> 00:58:45.60 But I had no desire to do anything besides recover, get back to training and persevere through
00:58:45.60 --> 00:58:49.84 the rest of selection. So that's what I did. I pushed myself harder than I'd previously thought
00:58:49.84 --> 00:58:55.92 possible. Quickly making up the ground, I'd lost on the rest of the cadets. I remember my
00:58:55.92 --> 00:59:02.88 fear of heights being pushed to the background when I tackled the transenium. My 60 seconds of
00:59:02.88 --> 00:59:08.40 milling past and such a blur, I can't remember them all. Besides an overwhelming need not to hurt
00:59:08.40 --> 00:59:13.28 the person I was paired with, but to prove to him and everyone looking on that I wasn't one
00:59:13.28 --> 00:59:17.68 for backing down whatever the circumstances. Perhaps I'm fortunate that I was born with this
00:59:17.68 --> 00:59:23.20 amount of grit and determination. It's not always a positive. I've been told many times that I'm
00:59:23.20 --> 00:59:29.44 a stuttered as a mule, but up there in the cold, wet, windy, cataract, these inner reserves of
00:59:29.44 --> 00:59:34.72 drive, vision, grit and resilience pulled me through and I got the beret I've been dreaming about.
00:59:35.76 --> 00:59:39.44 It's hard to think how different my life would have been without it.
00:59:42.72 --> 00:59:45.68 One of the reasons I wanted to read that little section was
00:59:45.68 --> 00:59:50.72 there's a point where you're doing a little bit of rationalization. Like, oh, you know,
00:59:50.72 --> 00:59:54.40 if I don't make it, you know, like, well, probably might not be that bad, you know, and I
00:59:54.40 --> 00:59:59.44 not to put up with this. I hear people rationalizing stuff all day long. It's matter of fact,
00:59:59.44 --> 01:00:05.04 there's a TV show echo truss. It's called lost and they basically take these people out
01:00:05.04 --> 01:00:08.48 in the middle of nowhere and buy yourself. I think it's called lost. No, it's called alone. Sorry,
01:00:08.48 --> 01:00:14.96 it's called alone. They go out and they put these people. My little daughter who's 10 at the time,
01:00:14.96 --> 01:00:19.92 she got really into it and we would watch it. And so you can quit at any time. You can
01:00:19.92 --> 01:00:25.76 keep your radio and send out a transponder and they come and get you. But you'd be listening to the
01:00:25.76 --> 01:00:31.20 people and you'd hear them start to rationalize. You know? And so I taught my daughter. I said,
01:00:31.20 --> 01:00:34.000 you know what they're doing right? They should be able to breath. Oh, he's rationalizing.
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.72 You know, because you know, the guys just know it's a, you know, I like being out here and I love
01:00:38.72 --> 01:00:42.88 the nature, but you know, I really miss my family. You know, I realize that my family's more and I
01:00:42.88 --> 01:00:46.72 look at my little daughter go, what's he doing right now? Rationalizing. He's about to quit.
01:00:47.76 --> 01:00:52.32 So I like the fact that you started going down a little bit down that path of rationalization.
01:00:52.32 --> 01:00:57.20 And then you said, you know what? No. Doesn't work. I think, you know, we're all to the
01:00:57.20 --> 01:01:03.20 prone to it to to varying degrees. And when when things get really tough, you know, they're
01:01:05.20 --> 01:01:09.92 elements of doubt do have a tendency to creep in and you just have to fight them. You have to sort of
01:01:09.92 --> 01:01:16.000 try and look at your situation objectively and realize what you're doing. And that rationalization
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:23.28 thankfully is is is is outrightly sort of castigated in the parachute regiment. And you're
01:01:23.28 --> 01:01:27.60 reminded stop rationalizing. And the instructors, it might sound like they're shouting at you,
01:01:27.60 --> 01:01:32.56 but what they're doing is just reminding you not to give up. So thankfully it's stamped out
01:01:32.56 --> 01:01:35.92 pretty quickly, but a lot of it's on your own shoulders. You know, nobody wants you to quit. You know,
01:01:35.92 --> 01:01:39.84 the, the unit needs officers that need soldiers. They don't want people to leave. They're not
01:01:39.84 --> 01:01:43.52 telling you to quit. They're telling you to not quit. But so it's down to you.
01:01:44.80 --> 01:01:50.24 And people do this with every freaking thing in everyday life all day long. Like that last rep
01:01:51.44 --> 01:01:57.76 or that donut that you're like, you know, I did work out. I did work out hard. And it's actually
01:01:57.76 --> 01:02:03.92 it's really good to board yourself. It's good to have a positive feedback. But I did work out hard
01:02:03.92 --> 01:02:08.72 yesterday. And yeah, I want to be said, I don't want to be in a grind all the time. You got to enjoy life.
01:02:08.72 --> 01:02:11.44 Yeah, right. Displaying, because freedom, how about the freedom part? Here's the freedom part.
01:02:11.44 --> 01:02:16.88 Leave it down. You can rationalize anything. You can literally rationalize anything. If you're
01:02:16.88 --> 01:02:23.12 if you're not freaking careful, you will rationalize stuff that's not good for you. So you, you get
01:02:23.12 --> 01:02:28.40 done with this train. Is the milling like the last final thing to close to the end? It's close to the end.
01:02:28.40 --> 01:02:33.84 I think, but the most important event of all is something called the log race. And basically,
01:02:33.84 --> 01:02:38.40 there's a big telegraph pole. I can't remember how much it weighs, but it's bloody heavy. And
01:02:38.40 --> 01:02:43.52 there's like eight, eight people on each log. And usually one or two officers on each log. And
01:02:43.52 --> 01:02:48.24 it's a race. So you've got four logs or however many. How many days is it, too? No, it's just
01:02:48.24 --> 01:02:54.48 it's one event. I think it's the second to last day or the final day. And it's basically you are.
01:02:54.48 --> 01:02:59.12 You'll set off. It's about, I think it's three miles or something like that. And it's a race between
01:02:59.12 --> 01:03:02.32 the different groups. But you've got to stay on the log. If you come off the logs and officer,
01:03:02.88 --> 01:03:08.32 that will stay with you for the rest of your career. I know generals who are in the 17
01:03:08.32 --> 01:03:14.16 is still reminded by their fellow officers that they came off the log in 1975. It happened. So
01:03:14.16 --> 01:03:19.20 you're made aware of this. So you used to, a couple of officers did come off the log. I stayed on it.
01:03:19.20 --> 01:03:23.60 There was only two people left on the log and this thing is bloody heavy. There's only two people left.
01:03:23.60 --> 01:03:28.32 Yeah. And so you're pretty much dragging this log up. So are you saying off the log? What do you mean?
01:03:28.32 --> 01:03:34.88 Like you start off? People just fall off and they just pass out. I mean, it's really heavy. You start with
01:03:34.88 --> 01:03:40.24 eight. You've got to, you know, like say two and a half or three miles on an off-road course. It's
01:03:40.24 --> 01:03:45.76 up these, you know, through through rivers and all this sort of stuff. And, uh, usually by the end of it,
01:03:45.76 --> 01:03:50.000 there's only like top couple of people left. Oh, really? Yeah. But there are other people still
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.84 graduate. Uh, they do. But if you fail to events on P company out of the 20 or so events, then you're
01:03:55.84 --> 01:04:01.84 off the course. So when I was, I was later in instructor on P company, usually with the soldiers,
01:04:01.84 --> 01:04:06.72 at least with the recruits, there's only about 10 or 11% pass rate. So we'd start off with a
01:04:06.72 --> 01:04:13.68 platoon of 90 or 100 recruits and we'd pass out 10 or 15. So that's how it's off at this.
01:04:13.68 --> 01:04:19.36 Yeah. Yeah. And how long is the whole training 21 weeks? Uh, yeah. So if we're on a log
01:04:20.64 --> 01:04:28.24 and we're going and I've passed every event, but I, you know, don't carry the log. I've
01:04:28.24 --> 01:04:33.44 go to the side or whatever. Yeah. I can still be a pair of only few, as don't come off one of the other
01:04:33.44 --> 01:04:38.08 events. So if you fail, let's say the assault course of the train A'sium, which is the area of
01:04:38.08 --> 01:04:41.44 assault course where you've got a sort of jump across the high nets and things like that, then you'll
01:04:41.44 --> 01:04:45.68 be off the course. So you can, you can get all the way to the end of the, you know, the course.
01:04:45.68 --> 01:04:49.04 And if you come off, if you fail two of these events, that's you off, then you'll get sent to another
01:04:49.04 --> 01:04:54.16 regiment. Is there a time limit on the log? Uh, imagine if there's only two of you left.
01:04:54.16 --> 01:04:58.96 Like it takes some time. It takes, it takes a while. Yeah. It's staying on is most important and not just
01:04:58.96 --> 01:05:05.68 giving up. In the seal training, you carry a log. You spend a lot of time with a log. But you also
01:05:05.68 --> 01:05:10.24 spend a lot of time with a boat like these little boats that that used to be made out of
01:05:10.24 --> 01:05:15.36 rubberized canvas. So they were really heavy. They're a lot lighter now than they were a good
01:05:15.36 --> 01:05:20.32 injury. But what's interesting, so when I went through, you know, you're carrying the boat on your
01:05:20.32 --> 01:05:24.48 head a lot. And this is sort of why I thought you were saying, you carry the boat on your head a lot.
01:05:24.48 --> 01:05:29.28 And you know, if we're all in a boat crew and there's eight of us in the boat crew,
01:05:30.48 --> 01:05:37.12 it's possible to sort of like shrink your head down a little bit and release your posture a little
01:05:37.12 --> 01:05:41.20 bit and not have your head carrying any weight, which means that everyone else carrying the weight.
01:05:41.20 --> 01:05:46.72 So when I went through it was like a sort of like it was happening and you'd see someone doing it
01:05:46.72 --> 01:05:50.64 and it'd be like, you'd hear people yelling like in another boat. Get your brick and in another
01:05:50.64 --> 01:05:56.08 boat man. Well, they didn't have this, but they haven't now. They have, you can actually you get
01:05:56.08 --> 01:06:02.72 written up for what they call duck boat. So they'd be like Charles, you're ducking boat. And you can
01:06:02.72 --> 01:06:07.68 get like a damaret. They didn't actually call it. They didn't have a name for it when I went through.
01:06:07.68 --> 01:06:13.76 But now they have a freaking name for it because it's like, it's like you're coming off your
01:06:13.76 --> 01:06:18.40 walk. You're not with the team and that's not cool. Well, we have the same thing. I mean,
01:06:18.40 --> 01:06:21.36 because we have that there's a stretcher race. So the same sort of thing where you carry a stretcher
01:06:21.36 --> 01:06:25.92 for five miles that one. So you can get through to the, as certainly as an officer, it's more
01:06:25.92 --> 01:06:29.92 apparent. But if you can get through to the whole course, even if you stayed on all of the events,
01:06:29.92 --> 01:06:34.64 you can get what's called a stand-up fail, which is basically you're still standing up, but
01:06:34.64 --> 01:06:38.64 you're failed on your attitude or personality. So you can still get a booted off if they don't
01:06:38.64 --> 01:06:45.12 like you. Yeah, that's as it should be, right? Because there's some non-conifiable leadership
01:06:45.12 --> 01:06:49.04 policies that some people have or don't have. And if somebody gets someone that's looking
01:06:49.04 --> 01:06:53.04 out for themselves and just trying to step on everyone's back to get to the top, we don't want
01:06:53.04 --> 01:07:00.80 that guy on the team. Yeah. So you get done with that. And now you show up, you show up at the
01:07:00.80 --> 01:07:06.40 regimen. More or less, you're still going to do the infantry battle school. So there's three
01:07:06.40 --> 01:07:12.48 months in Breckin' in Wales where you then go and do, no apologies, that was first, P company,
01:07:12.48 --> 01:07:21.92 and then yeah, that was to the unit. Yeah. So I joined the unit in 2006 just as they, my three
01:07:21.92 --> 01:07:25.68 power of getting back from Afghanistan on the first tour. So it was a pretty, that was a pretty
01:07:25.68 --> 01:07:30.88 punchy tour as well. And so Europe just, you know, it was, you meet, it was new me, straight in charge
01:07:30.88 --> 01:07:36.72 of 30 more veterans, and that was quite daunting challenge. Yeah. What was your, what was your,
01:07:36.72 --> 01:07:42.16 what lessons did you learn from that? Um, well, I'll never forget the day I was, I took over my
01:07:42.16 --> 01:07:46.24 pertune. I met the guys and you know, you sort of towards its handhairs that you're going to have
01:07:46.24 --> 01:07:49.84 this sort of general Montgomery moment where you're sort of, you know, standing on a land Rover,
01:07:49.84 --> 01:07:53.84 sort of addressing your soldiers as they're all on parade. Doesn't really work like that. I sort of
01:07:53.84 --> 01:07:58.88 walked into the barracks and they were all like bed. Oh, could I speak to the guys? So they all
01:07:58.88 --> 01:08:04.08 came together and there was a corporal, a couple of cram tree, Chris Cram tree, big guy, and
01:08:04.08 --> 01:08:09.92 said, sir, can I tell you a joke? He said, yeah, go on. And he said, how many, um, sangin veterans? Does
01:08:09.92 --> 01:08:13.92 it take to change a light bulb? I don't know. He says, of course you don't know. So because you
01:08:13.92 --> 01:08:21.60 weren't fucking there. Oh, thanks. Welcome aboard. But it was, no, it was daunting. But, you know,
01:08:21.60 --> 01:08:26.32 I felt prepared, you know, sandhurst, the injury battle school, peak and it prepares you. It gives
01:08:26.32 --> 01:08:32.56 you that confidence, you know, milling, boxing, all that stuff. So whilst it was like, quite
01:08:32.56 --> 01:08:36.08 something, I'd already, I'd hitchhiked through it, I've got to start, you know, a couple of
01:08:36.08 --> 01:08:39.20 it, a couple of it, a couple of it. I think when some of the guys started learning some of my
01:08:39.20 --> 01:08:44.24 stories, they had a slightly more respectful, than they probably could have had. But it's
01:08:44.24 --> 01:08:47.04 a big challenge, you know, you've got to prove to you, man, they're not going to, they're not
01:08:47.04 --> 01:08:52.000 just going to follow you until they know you're not, you know, not a dick, basically. How long
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.44 is it? Your, um, what's the training like now the guys come home? I'm sure they stand down for a
01:08:57.44 --> 01:09:01.68 little while and then they'd say we got to get ready to go back. So I think the turnaround was
01:09:01.68 --> 01:09:06.24 about 14 months before the next deployment. So there was a little bit of downtime. There was
01:09:06.24 --> 01:09:10.56 plenty of opportunity for the guys to get some rest and do things like adventure training.
01:09:11.84 --> 01:09:17.92 And I mean, there's the story in the book where, as a junior officer, the planning officer said,
01:09:17.92 --> 01:09:24.64 this is the kayak. What is the kayak on you? Oh well, go ahead. So basically the CEO said,
01:09:24.64 --> 01:09:28.56 like, all the new officers, so the six guys that we'd all just come out straight out of Sandears,
01:09:28.56 --> 01:09:34.48 you guys pick a sport each and then get all the guys to go and do something fun. So I said,
01:09:34.48 --> 01:09:38.96 okay, well, I was looking at sports and all my colleagues at, I would have pretty much chosen what
01:09:38.96 --> 01:09:46.16 they were, they're sort of chosen sports were. So somebody did soccer, football, somebody else did,
01:09:46.16 --> 01:09:50.48 you know, ran the rugby team. My only sport, of course, at that time was boxing, but three
01:09:50.48 --> 01:09:54.56 parrots already had very well-established boxing teams. So there's no way I could go and join that.
01:09:55.12 --> 01:09:58.000 So I was sort of scrambling around, thought, okay, well, I'll just do kayaking.
01:09:59.12 --> 01:10:03.36 It sounds like fun. You know, I had done a bit when I was a kid, so I'll do that.
01:10:03.36 --> 01:10:10.56 So I went into sort of, you know, as for volunteers, I got six or seven very unwilling volunteers
01:10:10.56 --> 01:10:14.16 from the soldiers because they'd rather be on leave, but they'd all been told they had to join
01:10:14.16 --> 01:10:18.40 one of these clubs as well. Now, that's when things started getting competitive because the
01:10:18.40 --> 01:10:21.76 parrots being the parrots, the commanding officer sort of then threw into the ring, he said,
01:10:21.76 --> 01:10:26.40 look, you've all got to apply for, whichever sport it is, apply for a competition and you've got
01:10:26.40 --> 01:10:30.64 to win it because you're parrots. So you were just thinking, we put together a kayak. It was
01:10:30.64 --> 01:10:33.52 better than fun. And we'll go out in the river and we'll have some fun and exactly.
01:10:33.52 --> 01:10:36.96 It'll be all good. You can probably travel. You see, you're always trying to find some scam to
01:10:36.96 --> 01:10:42.24 travel. Exactly. Yeah. But then he says, hey, I want competition. So, and I was based on
01:10:42.24 --> 01:10:49.68 place of colchester in Essex. Now, there's no sort of particular venue to go and learn kayaking
01:10:49.68 --> 01:10:54.96 in colchester, pop from the local canal system. Now, this is winter. So, I basically managed to get
01:10:54.96 --> 01:11:01.84 hold a bunch of these boats and we were out paddling in the frozen, dirty waters of Essex
01:11:01.84 --> 01:11:05.92 canals. Now, there's like shopping, probably floating in the water. There was like, you know,
01:11:05.92 --> 01:11:09.12 the homeless guys sort of taken a leak off the bridges, we were going under it. I mean,
01:11:09.12 --> 01:11:13.84 it was that kind of, it was pretty grim. And so the guys were not particularly inspired by this
01:11:13.84 --> 01:11:18.48 by this whole project. And I was trying to find a suitable competition to enter and that the
01:11:18.48 --> 01:11:25.52 main kayaking competition in the UK is basically a race. It's a hundred mile race along the
01:11:25.52 --> 01:11:32.08 tembs from a place called Henley to Westminster. It's called the Devises to Westminster race.
01:11:32.08 --> 01:11:35.44 But that wasn't until May, which was we were meant to be back in the training cycle
01:11:35.44 --> 01:11:39.76 plan. So, the other thing I think are, for find, it was over these two weekend, which was the
01:11:39.76 --> 01:11:45.76 army canoe polo championships, which was in a swimming pool, a pool in a town called Luldershop,
01:11:45.76 --> 01:11:51.04 which is the home of the parents. And so, I applied for this competition. They were like,
01:11:51.04 --> 01:11:54.88 yeah, we don't normally get power as applied, but find, turn up. So, after we, you know, we
01:11:54.88 --> 01:11:58.88 done like several weeks training the guys were just about competence in staying in the boats
01:11:58.88 --> 01:12:03.44 without falling out. But, you know, bile means none of them could do a proper escape of
01:12:03.44 --> 01:12:08.08 all at this stage. So, we turned up on, on Easter weekend. And the guys were all really annoyed
01:12:08.08 --> 01:12:12.24 because it was Easter weekend. They wanted to be a home with their families. And we found the
01:12:12.24 --> 01:12:15.52 swimming pool attendant that the guy was running the competition. He said, oh, you're
01:12:15.52 --> 01:12:20.08 didn't expect you to turn up. And we got now about to set right again the pool. And we
01:12:20.08 --> 01:12:23.20 look at that, where's all the other teams? There was a measure of like six other teams entering.
01:12:23.20 --> 01:12:26.96 He said, well, it's Easter. Obviously, nobody's bothered to do any people here. So, he said,
01:12:26.96 --> 01:12:31.92 well, what does that mean? He said, well, you've got the gold medal. So, out of all the teams that,
01:12:31.92 --> 01:12:35.28 in the Paris did all these sports, we were the only ones to actually win our competition.
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.60 Obviously, we didn't need to tell anyone that nobody else had turned up. We'd won by default.
01:12:39.60 --> 01:12:44.56 But it goes to show, you know, if you, if you, you've got to be in it to win it. So, it's the
01:12:44.56 --> 01:12:49.28 speed. Now, you guys are going, do you know that you're preparing to go to Afghanistan?
01:12:49.28 --> 01:12:53.28 Yeah, we knew. We knew that. So, in the deployment was in the spring of 2008.
01:12:55.60 --> 01:12:59.52 Especially off the back of the first tour that they'd been involved with the Paris or the first of
01:12:59.52 --> 01:13:03.92 the whole British Army to go into Southern Afghanistan into Helmond and it was like I say, it was a,
01:13:04.96 --> 01:13:09.44 it was a very kinetic tour. There was, there was a lot of stories coming out of it. So, there's,
01:13:09.44 --> 01:13:14.80 there's a lot of things to live up to. So, yeah, so we deployed to Helmond and
01:13:15.84 --> 01:13:20.80 Canned Har and we were on something called the Regional Command Group South. So, we were basically
01:13:20.80 --> 01:13:26.72 the rapid response unit to go and fly in helicopters to wherever they needed us. And it was a pretty
01:13:26.72 --> 01:13:30.40 varied role. It was, it was interesting because we weren't in one of the four operating bases,
01:13:30.40 --> 01:13:35.76 like two parrots who were stuck in in one of these fobs for the whole six months. We were bouncing
01:13:35.76 --> 01:13:40.48 around all over the place. Which meant that we would, you know, one day we'd be doing a raid on
01:13:40.48 --> 01:13:44.72 the Taliban commander. Another day we'd be helping the local police builder. Police station,
01:13:44.72 --> 01:13:48.56 another time we'd be going out, clearing the opium. You know, so it was a really interesting,
01:13:48.56 --> 01:13:54.24 varied role. But it did mean that we all had to get our heads into this, you know, 360 degree battle
01:13:54.24 --> 01:13:59.20 space, hybrid warfare, noted two days were the same. And so it was, it was quite a complicated
01:13:59.20 --> 01:14:03.76 environment in which to operate. What did you turn over, where did you get a turn over from somebody
01:14:03.76 --> 01:14:08.96 when you showed up there? Yeah, we did. I think it was the role Marines who were in there before us.
01:14:09.92 --> 01:14:15.68 But the role itself of, of RC South was pretty undefined. So, it was pretty much whatever the brigade
01:14:15.68 --> 01:14:21.12 commander said we'd go do. So, it might be the first job that we did was in a place called Maywanda.
01:14:21.12 --> 01:14:28.72 We had to go and clear this, this town of any, any Taliban elements. I'd read about Maywanda
01:14:28.72 --> 01:14:34.80 from my, my days doing history. And this was a place that the British Army had been in in 1842.
01:14:34.80 --> 01:14:39.44 And it turns out we were stationed in the same fort as the British Army 150 years previously.
01:14:39.44 --> 01:14:44.16 So that was pretty, you know, interesting from somebody who'd studied the region.
01:14:44.16 --> 01:14:52.24 You go into some of your, some of the operations in here and some of the leadership really
01:14:52.24 --> 01:14:57.76 lessons that you learned, which are great lessons. I'm going to the book here. Once on operations
01:14:57.76 --> 01:15:02.40 in Zabul province in southern Afghanistan, my platoon was given the mission to search a village for a
01:15:02.40 --> 01:15:07.12 known terrorist recruiter. For the most part, this involved being invited by friendly women for
01:15:07.12 --> 01:15:12.000 tea, scanning their kitchens and gardens with metal detectors, and then being cursed and told
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.84 the house belonged to an absent uncle. As we dug up room and removed caches of weapon. After
01:15:17.84 --> 01:15:21.60 walking around all day, we were low on the water and needed to get back to the helicopter pick-up
01:15:21.60 --> 01:15:27.12 point, which was five miles away across the desert. As we were leaving the village, I noticed a group of
01:15:27.12 --> 01:15:33.84 men huddled under, huddled around under the shade of a mulberry tree. They looked shifty and stared at
01:15:33.84 --> 01:15:41.28 us as we walked past. One of them wore a white turban and had coal around his eyes looking like a
01:15:41.28 --> 01:15:47.76 Taliban leader. I got the translator to say hello and ask their names, which he doly noted. I reported
01:15:47.76 --> 01:15:53.76 the names by radio to our intelligence cell and they said they were all clear, so we left the men
01:15:53.76 --> 01:15:59.44 and trek back across the desert to where my boss was waiting. By now, the whole platoon was exhausted
01:15:59.44 --> 01:16:06.16 and thirsty. We had not had time to eat all day and the temperature was over 50 degrees Celsius,
01:16:06.16 --> 01:16:11.20 which is like a hundred and twenty degrees Fahrenheit. One of the soldiers was beginning to wobble
01:16:11.20 --> 01:16:16.64 and I expected it might be heat exhaustion. Then to make matters worse, my boss came over.
01:16:17.28 --> 01:16:22.40 Left, you know that group of men in the village? Yes, well, the one in the white turban. The
01:16:22.40 --> 01:16:29.12 insell now says they want him in for questioning. What the hell? I reported his name on the radio
01:16:29.12 --> 01:16:35.12 and they said he was clear. I know they screwed up. So what now? Well, we've got two hours before
01:16:35.12 --> 01:16:42.000 your helicopter comes, go and get him. I shook my head. I had two hours and it was 10 miles, a 16
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.76 kilometer round trip. In the paras, we have a well-known physical stamina test known as the 10
01:16:47.76 --> 01:16:54.000 Miler, which is a punishing speed march while carrying kit. They can be hard work at home in the rain,
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.44 but out here in the desert, low on water, I knew it might be deadly. I looked at my man and could tell
01:16:59.44 --> 01:17:04.24 that half of them weren't up to it. They were exhausted, but orders were orders. I figured that I could
01:17:04.24 --> 01:17:10.56 do the job with 10 or 12 men, so half of the men could stay behind. I knew that in order to do so,
01:17:10.56 --> 01:17:15.92 I had to get them to buy into the vision and feel ownership. So instead of barking out an order,
01:17:15.92 --> 01:17:21.60 I gathered my section commanders around. I told them the situation and asked them what they thought
01:17:21.60 --> 01:17:27.84 were the best options. A lesson I learned early on is that even if you already know the answer
01:17:27.84 --> 01:17:32.72 asked the question, it makes people feel valued and part of the team and decision-making process.
01:17:32.72 --> 01:17:38.88 It doesn't matter who gets the credit for the decision and when you take your own ego out of the
01:17:38.88 --> 01:17:45.52 equation, it's amazing what happens. Sir, I have an idea, said the youngest corporal, why don't we
01:17:45.52 --> 01:17:50.48 leave half the men behind and take some of their water? I'm sure we can do the job with 10 or 12
01:17:50.48 --> 01:17:56.000 men. Men, that's a great idea. I said padding them on the back. He grin from ear to ear, and I made
01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.40 him the point man. I need 12 volunteers to come with me. I said the rest of you can stay here.
01:18:00.40 --> 01:18:04.48 The men looked at each other. The new would be one of the hardest tabs of their life,
01:18:04.48 --> 01:18:08.48 and that it would be dangerous because the Taliban now knew our strength and would have
01:18:08.48 --> 01:18:11.76 time to prepare an attack as they saw us walking back across the desert.
01:18:12.40 --> 01:18:16.88 Private Foster, one of the new soldiers put his hand up. I'll come sir. I need the exercise he
01:18:16.88 --> 01:18:23.12 joked. So Vester was next. Then another and another because we had a strong team bonded with trust.
01:18:23.12 --> 01:18:27.60 I had no shortage of volunteers. Even some of the men who I knew stood no chance of making
01:18:27.60 --> 01:18:32.96 it started to put their hands up because they felt ashamed, but I already had enough. We redistributed
01:18:32.96 --> 01:18:37.20 the water, gridded our teeth, and marched back across the desert to the village where we found the
01:18:37.20 --> 01:18:41.52 man in the white turban arrested him, and marched all the way back again being chased by an angry
01:18:41.52 --> 01:18:48.000 mob of Afghans. It was a hard slog, but one of the most determined team efforts I'd seen in my career.
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.04 To top it off, we later found out that the man in the white turban was at the top of the regional
01:18:53.04 --> 01:19:00.08 most wanted list. That victory and a shared hardship cemented the bonds of the Paltoon even stronger.
01:19:00.08 --> 01:19:03.28 There was nothing that my men didn't think they could accomplish.
01:19:07.28 --> 01:19:12.56 legit, I get it. Often I'll get asked, you know, how can I get my team to buy into the plan?
01:19:12.56 --> 01:19:14.24 I was saying, but then come up with the plan.
01:19:15.20 --> 01:19:18.16 Simple as it. Let them come up with the plan. That's what you do.
01:19:18.16 --> 01:19:24.000 That's something you say you learned it. Where do you think you picked that up? Was it something
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.84 that you saw the instructors doing at San Hurst? Is it what your sergeants ran thing?
01:19:29.84 --> 01:19:30.56 Ran things?
01:19:30.56 --> 01:19:35.12 I'll give you the honest answer. I was actually, I watched a series called Shop.
01:19:35.12 --> 01:19:42.72 I did if you've ever seen it. It was about, thanks so. It was basically about the war at the
01:19:42.72 --> 01:19:53.12 Peninsula War in the 19th century. It was basically a military drama series. It's often referred
01:19:53.12 --> 01:19:58.96 to a military circles because it was a fun war in the sense that it was in her. What's the name of
01:19:58.96 --> 01:20:05.76 this musical shop? Richard Shop. As an SHARP. So an America-We'd say,
01:20:05.76 --> 01:20:10.48 what you're saying right now sounds like SHARP. It's all good. I'm married to a Brit. I kind of understood it.
01:20:10.48 --> 01:20:20.40 So shop is a military officer. He's a commander in the rifles and basically often cited as a sort of
01:20:20.40 --> 01:20:25.52 figurehead in leadership. But I remember watching that as a kid and thinking, he does exactly the same.
01:20:26.08 --> 01:20:30.40 When did the series come out? Oh, it was back in the 1990s. This is an old series by a group
01:20:30.40 --> 01:20:35.68 watching shop. I think that was probably where I first saw that style of leadership. But again,
01:20:35.68 --> 01:20:42.000 of course, it was drilled into a soundhorses and in training to bring your team into the plan.
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.48 If you've got a vision that's great, but you've got to get people to buy into it. I think empowering
01:20:46.48 --> 01:20:53.68 people, letting them take ownership of those ideas is the best way of doing that. Totally agree.
01:20:55.84 --> 01:20:59.36 Yeah, a lot of times even if you think you have the answer and you ask the team what they think,
01:20:59.36 --> 01:21:01.84 they're going to come up with the better answer than you had in the first place. Exactly.
01:21:01.84 --> 01:21:07.44 So it's like, why not just ask them? Yeah. And I think ego is often the downfall of a lot of leaders
01:21:07.44 --> 01:21:12.08 in some ways because it's when you, when you sort of, when you think that, because I'm the leader,
01:21:12.08 --> 01:21:15.92 I have to have the answer. That's when things go wrong, especially in the military context.
01:21:15.92 --> 01:21:25.04 Yeah, 100% 100%. That's a, that's a killer. Leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.
01:21:25.04 --> 01:21:33.52 So also pays to be lucky sometimes. Another little section back to the book. One day we were
01:21:33.52 --> 01:21:38.24 setting up a temporary encampment on the outskirts of a lush valley. I got the call from my
01:21:38.24 --> 01:21:42.32 commanding officer that a vehicle had been blown up a couple miles away and I was to take my
01:21:42.32 --> 01:21:47.20 puttune out on a rescue mission. Our armored cars had special tracks that could go over any kind of
01:21:47.20 --> 01:21:52.96 terrain. We drove them across the desert and up to the top of an escarbman where the location of
01:21:52.96 --> 01:21:58.64 the explosion had been reported. As we got closer, I looked through the front windscreen and could
01:21:58.64 --> 01:22:05.52 see the remains of a land rover blown to smithereens. I was expecting the worst as there should have
01:22:05.52 --> 01:22:11.12 been four soldiers inside. I called the team medic and told him to get ready to treat any
01:22:11.12 --> 01:22:18.08 surviving casualties. We stopped short by 50 meters in case there were any other bombs nearby. And when
01:22:18.08 --> 01:22:23.52 I got out of my vehicle to my absolute surprise and joy, I saw that all the men were fine. When the
01:22:23.52 --> 01:22:28.48 landmine had exploded, it had sent a shockwave through the car sending everyone in it flying out
01:22:28.48 --> 01:22:33.12 onto the ground. They were all alive and seemingly unharmed. I asked them if they were okay and a
01:22:33.12 --> 01:22:37.44 part from being dizzy and shaken. They not had been walked over to where I was standing.
01:22:38.16 --> 01:22:42.88 There was space in one of our three vehicles. So I put the men in the back of the car at the front
01:22:42.88 --> 01:22:47.68 telling the lead vehicle that we should reverse back out of the danger area because we might be in a
01:22:47.68 --> 01:22:53.44 mind field. It seemed like a sensible option. So that's what we did. Making sure that we stayed
01:22:53.44 --> 01:22:58.88 exactly in our own tracks until we were well clear of the flat plateau. At that point, my three
01:22:58.88 --> 01:23:03.60 vehicles needed to turn around so that we didn't get stuck in a bottleneck between two large cliffs.
01:23:03.60 --> 01:23:09.44 So the front vehicle did a three point turn and pushed around the other two so that it was now
01:23:09.44 --> 01:23:14.88 facing forward again in the lead. We all did the same and drove off down a track back towards the
01:23:14.88 --> 01:23:19.60 encampment and by now I was in vehicle number two where the commander should always be.
01:23:21.20 --> 01:23:26.88 Then just as we left the scraggie bolder field, there was an enormous explosion. And I felt the
01:23:26.88 --> 01:23:31.76 shockwave hit my own car. After a second of deafness and ringing in my ears, I looked through
01:23:31.76 --> 01:23:36.96 my windscreen to see a massive cloud of dust as it cleared. I realized what had happened.
01:23:36.96 --> 01:23:42.32 The point vehicle had driven over another mind. And to make matters worse, it was the same four
01:23:42.32 --> 01:23:47.60 soldiers who had been in the first explosion. I shouted down the radio telling everyone to stop exactly
01:23:47.60 --> 01:23:52.72 where they were. We're whilst I considered the situation. I could see bodies lying in the dirt next to
01:23:52.72 --> 01:23:59.68 the car, which had the front end rip off of it. Now I knew I had to show some real leadership.
01:24:00.24 --> 01:24:04.80 And there was only one thing for it. The metal detectors were in the car at the back and it
01:24:04.80 --> 01:24:09.04 would take them a good 10 minute to clear the path between the cars. Let alone get to the front where
01:24:09.04 --> 01:24:14.16 we might have had heavy casualties. I got out of the car, pulled out my bandet and began to crawl
01:24:14.16 --> 01:24:20.88 forward, stabbing the sand in front of me to check for mines. Luckily the car in front wasn't too far
01:24:20.88 --> 01:24:26.000 and I was able to cover the distance quickly. I reached the car and to my relief found that yet again
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:32.56 by some miracle everyone was alive. And what's more uningered? One of the soldiers stood up,
01:24:32.56 --> 01:24:36.56 dusted himself off and looked at me stabbing around in the dirt. What are you doing, sir?
01:24:36.56 --> 01:24:41.52 He laughed. You won't find any Taliban down there. It was a lucky day. Made even lucky.
01:24:41.52 --> 01:24:45.68 You're as I was filling out the daily report back at camp when I found out that my team and the
01:24:45.68 --> 01:24:50.96 remaining vehicle had been tasked with denying the half blown up cars that meant going back to the
01:24:50.96 --> 01:24:55.28 site and blowing them up properly with explosives so the Taliban couldn't make use of them in the
01:24:55.28 --> 01:24:59.60 future. It was a simple task and I was told that I should remain behind with the other
01:24:59.60 --> 01:25:04.80 platoon commanders so that we could receive our orders for the next day. As the team were driving back,
01:25:04.80 --> 01:25:12.000 they too hit a land mine and the empty commander's seat where I normally would have been sitting
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.20 was completely destroyed by the explosion. You can't be a leader unless you're willing to put
01:25:17.20 --> 01:25:23.04 your team ahead of yourself when circumstances call for it. This requires moral courage and integrity
01:25:23.04 --> 01:25:28.80 the building blocks not only of great leadership but of a fulfilled purposeful life.
01:25:28.80 --> 01:25:37.68 Just out there digging for mines. There's a lucky day, a very lucky day.
01:25:37.68 --> 01:25:41.28 And no one got in your seat, no one got in your vehicle commander seat.
01:25:41.28 --> 01:25:48.56 Yeah. That was a, yeah. I look back now and thank my lucky stars that, yeah, that was a very lucky day.
01:25:50.24 --> 01:25:54.48 What was the uptempo? So like how often were you guys running out and going out on missions?
01:25:54.48 --> 01:26:00.16 Well, because of the nature of the job, we were like I said doing different things. So we'd go
01:26:00.16 --> 01:26:04.72 out and clear a valley one day. We might be out for a week and we'd come back to Kandar. We were
01:26:04.72 --> 01:26:09.68 based in Kandar area based alongside the Canadians for the most part. Most of the Brits were
01:26:09.68 --> 01:26:15.60 either in Bastion or in, you know, one of the fobs. So it was quite, I mean, Kandar Harb,
01:26:15.60 --> 01:26:20.32 Erbase, you know, had a Timmy Horton's coffee and a pizza hut. It had a burger king. I mean,
01:26:20.32 --> 01:26:25.44 it's a bizarre, it's a experience. So you're out there getting blown at one minute and then you're
01:26:25.44 --> 01:26:30.24 in, you're in with the, with the remps as we all, you're like to call them another and it's such a
01:26:30.24 --> 01:26:34.72 bizarre thing to get your head around. But we weren't in that long, we'd stay for a few days.
01:26:34.72 --> 01:26:39.12 We'd regroup, we'd clean ourselves up and then we'd get back out there. And we did some really
01:26:39.12 --> 01:26:44.08 fascinating, you know, operations. We did, according to the news report, at least, we'd just
01:26:44.08 --> 01:26:51.52 want the biggest airborne assaults of the entire, of the entire war. We flew to, into the bull with,
01:26:52.32 --> 01:26:57.84 kind of how many shunooks, it was like, 10 shunooks with Apache support to do a full battalion level
01:26:57.84 --> 01:27:02.96 assault. And stuff like that when you've got, when you've got right at the varker, he's blaring
01:27:02.96 --> 01:27:11.04 out of the speakers. It was pretty energising to the saber least. Equally, you know, we'd be out there
01:27:11.04 --> 01:27:16.32 helping rebuild a school painter, painter police station in the next shows. It was quite, it was,
01:27:17.20 --> 01:27:21.12 it was challenging on different levels. It wasn't that we were getting as many fights,
01:27:21.12 --> 01:27:25.28 because actually the guys in the fobs were getting attacked every day. They weren't immortal every
01:27:25.28 --> 01:27:32.72 day. We'd often go for it for a week without fire shot in anger. So it wasn't necessarily the,
01:27:33.28 --> 01:27:38.40 the intensity of the fighting, certainly for my tour. It was more of the variety and the scale of
01:27:38.40 --> 01:27:42.72 what we were trying to achieve. How long was the deployment in total? Normally there's six months,
01:27:42.72 --> 01:27:48.48 I needed four months because I was at the end of my tour as a bazoon commander. So my replacement
01:27:48.48 --> 01:27:52.72 was sort of brought in and then I had to move onto another job. So that's when I went to be a,
01:27:53.44 --> 01:28:00.32 an infantry at the recruitment centre. I was then a directing staff sort of recruiting and training
01:28:00.32 --> 01:28:07.28 recruits back where I'd done my training before. And that's a historical deployment for,
01:28:07.28 --> 01:28:10.88 for the paras down there. I know I was doing just some reading about it.
01:28:12.08 --> 01:28:17.28 Yeah, had a corporal Brian bud. He was posh, he was the word of the Victoria Cross. Sounds like he just
01:28:18.56 --> 01:28:25.76 led a flanking maneuver against enemy Taliban fighters and it up being killed, but was able to
01:28:25.76 --> 01:28:29.52 suppress enough fire that the rest of his team could maneuver. There's another guy named
01:28:29.52 --> 01:28:38.72 Corporal Mark Wright awarded the George Cross. Pretty, I mean, just you read the story. It's
01:28:40.72 --> 01:28:46.16 unbelievable story, heartbreaking story, but there in a minefield, there's guys wounded.
01:28:47.44 --> 01:28:52.32 He's, as he's trying to get his guys out of this minefield, like what he's singing happy birthday to
01:28:52.32 --> 01:28:57.36 one of his friends. That's, you know, in a really bad way and he ends up dying wounds, but I mean,
01:28:57.36 --> 01:29:05.76 just a just of incredible bravery and upholding that tradition of the paras, you know, to this day.
01:29:07.84 --> 01:29:15.52 Awesome stuff. When you get back, I know you mentioned in the book that you were
01:29:17.12 --> 01:29:24.24 considering going to selection for the special forces. And then,
01:29:24.24 --> 01:29:29.04 well, that was the, that was the natural progression. Like I say, after the tour,
01:29:30.56 --> 01:29:36.24 it's considered the next step is, is most of the officers then go to back to Catric to then train the next
01:29:37.60 --> 01:29:42.16 baz of recruits. I mean, it wasn't my first choice. I didn't really want to go and be in the wind
01:29:42.16 --> 01:29:46.08 of the rain, training recruits. I would have loved to have spent more time in Afghanistan, but
01:29:47.28 --> 01:29:52.80 that's the way it goes. You know, in the army, so I was up in Catric. I'd say them on my morale
01:29:52.80 --> 01:29:58.16 was sort of flagging a little bit because I would actually, I wouldn't say I necessarily enjoyed
01:29:58.16 --> 01:30:04.16 Afghanistan. Well, I'd do, I live, yeah, I did quite enjoy some of it. But that's why I joined the army.
01:30:04.16 --> 01:30:10.24 And so I was there. I thought, okay, well, you know, a gov-especially forces selection, that will be the next
01:30:10.24 --> 01:30:16.56 thing. So, past all the initial tests and it was meant to be going on the full selection in January
01:30:16.56 --> 01:30:25.92 2009. And I was at my peak fitness. I was good to go. And then I made the era of going to see my
01:30:25.92 --> 01:30:34.88 girlfriend in Mexico who had a ranch. And in a bout of silliness, I decided to get on the horse
01:30:34.88 --> 01:30:39.36 and do some rodeo on her ranch. The horse threw me over a six-foot war and I broke my leg
01:30:39.36 --> 01:30:47.52 a week before I was meant to be on selection. So, I had to sort of limp in back to the barracks and
01:30:47.52 --> 01:30:52.64 obviously I was told I couldn't do selection. Needless to say, and what was worse was all of the
01:30:52.64 --> 01:30:56.96 jobs for the next deploy, which was going to be happening in a few more months, had already been taken.
01:30:57.92 --> 01:31:04.48 So, it was a crux point in my career and I was like, well, okay, do I stay and then
01:31:04.48 --> 01:31:11.44 do a job that I don't enjoy for two years or do I look at this as an opportunity? And it was
01:31:11.44 --> 01:31:15.92 quite a pretty depressing time because I was desperate to get back out there and do what I
01:31:15.92 --> 01:31:20.80 loved the most. But equally, I didn't really fancy spending two years doing a desk job. That
01:31:20.80 --> 01:31:25.92 wasn't wise on the military at all. So, I rang up my, I said,
01:31:25.92 --> 01:31:29.12 they're not saying about those desk jobs, we just drove them out there. That's not even a thing.
01:31:29.12 --> 01:31:34.08 No, there's no recruiting poster that shows if officer sitting at a desk making a power
01:31:34.08 --> 01:31:44.000 point. Exactly. Yeah. Excellent job. So, I, after sort of really, you know, going through some
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.64 heart-wrenching decision-making, I thought, you know what, I think now's the time to do something
01:31:48.64 --> 01:31:53.12 else. And actually in hindsight, it was because I left Hungary, it was because I left still
01:31:53.12 --> 01:32:00.24 hand-curing for a bit of adventure. And I didn't feel as though I'd done everything I wanted to do
01:32:00.24 --> 01:32:04.80 in, on that side of things that I'd probably, it gave me the impetus to do what came next.
01:32:04.80 --> 01:32:11.76 So, I left them by a twist of luck I suppose when I, because you have to usually give 12 months,
01:32:11.76 --> 01:32:16.64 notice when you leave the military. But when I rang up the army personnel, somebody hadn't
01:32:16.64 --> 01:32:22.08 filled out the paperwork properly. So, I meant that I could actually leave informants. And my boss
01:32:22.08 --> 01:32:26.32 at the time took a look, just take the time off, get yourself together. So, I was on full pay. And
01:32:26.32 --> 01:32:30.80 off I went. So, as soon as my leg was fixed, that was me on to whatever came next. I didn't
01:32:30.80 --> 01:32:37.60 really have a plan other than thinking to that. Other than thinking actually now is probably the
01:32:37.60 --> 01:32:42.56 time I can go back to that schoolboy dream of somehow becoming an explorer.
01:32:42.56 --> 01:32:48.000 Well, what point did you climb mirror peak? Yeah. So, that was in, that was again, that was just
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:53.76 before I broke my leg, it was in October that year. So, I was, again, it bit of downtime,
01:32:53.76 --> 01:32:58.56 I was given the opportunity to do what, you know, as affectionate as adventure training in the
01:32:58.56 --> 01:33:02.64 army, but it's usually involves doing some hill walking in Wales. I wanted to do something
01:33:02.64 --> 01:33:07.52 a bit more exciting. So, I decided to organize a proper mountaineering exhibition to the Nepal
01:33:07.52 --> 01:33:14.32 Himalayas. So, I got together a bunch of the junior NCOs at Catric who were, you know, my training
01:33:14.32 --> 01:33:18.08 staff and said, let's go and climb a mountain. None of them had climbed a mountain before.
01:33:18.08 --> 01:33:23.60 But being Paris, they all sort of said this sounds like fun. It's three weeks off work. So,
01:33:23.60 --> 01:33:31.60 off we go. And that was my introduction to proper civilian style leadership in many ways,
01:33:31.60 --> 01:33:37.44 because it was, you know, we were not in uniform. We were doing a learning and new skill in a new
01:33:37.44 --> 01:33:43.28 environment. So, off we went and we went to Climera Peak, which is not a technical mountain,
01:33:43.28 --> 01:33:48.24 but it's six and a half thousand meters, which is what's that? That's like, I think it's about 21,000
01:33:48.24 --> 01:33:56.72 for 247 feet. Spot on. Good girl. So, it's a pretty high mountain and the air is thin up there,
01:33:56.72 --> 01:34:00.08 and you know, you can sort of have altitude sickness off, and it's a three-week expedition.
01:34:01.84 --> 01:34:05.28 And it was actually pretty demanding, especially for some of the guys who'd never
01:34:05.28 --> 01:34:09.04 been to that altitude before. And I'd been backpacking in Nepal and I'd done that sort of thing,
01:34:09.04 --> 01:34:15.28 but I'd never, never ever been to that sort of height. So, it was, it was a really interesting lesson
01:34:15.28 --> 01:34:21.36 in motivating soldiers who soldiers loved to complain at the best of times, especially when this
01:34:21.36 --> 01:34:26.88 is their vacation time. So, it was all fun and gamed until we got to sort of five thousand
01:34:26.88 --> 01:34:30.40 meters, so, 15,000 feet, and that's when things get really tough and cold.
01:34:30.40 --> 01:34:36.64 Yeah, you, you break it down really well. I'll go to the book here. After more than 10 days of
01:34:36.64 --> 01:34:41.44 hard trekking, we finally reached the snow line where the temperature is plummeted to minus 27 degrees.
01:34:43.28 --> 01:34:48.16 And with Gail Force winds making the setup of camp a dreadful prospect at least three of the
01:34:48.16 --> 01:34:52.80 others, and I were suffering severe headaches, dehydration, and very cold feet, as we tried
01:34:52.80 --> 01:34:58.88 unsuccessfully to sleep at 5,000 meters. On the summit day, we were greeted with clear conditions.
01:34:59.60 --> 01:35:04.000 But two of the local sherpas decided to remain with the tents in camp rather than the
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:10.56 center to the top. I led the way with Jordie. I led the way with Jordie and our mountain guide Jason.
01:35:10.56 --> 01:35:15.92 We plotted through the flick snow tied together in case a crevasse opened up. It was punishing
01:35:15.92 --> 01:35:21.68 slow going into every step was hard earned with short gasping breaths. The summit came into view.
01:35:21.68 --> 01:35:26.96 A few hundred meters ahead, but there was no time to celebrate. As we stop for a short break,
01:35:26.96 --> 01:35:30.72 one of the soldiers approached me complaining that he couldn't feel his feet anymore.
01:35:30.72 --> 01:35:35.92 His boots had been on the tight side, and as a result, his toes were right up against the edge of
01:35:35.92 --> 01:35:40.64 the boot. As we'd been trained, I ordered him to remove his boots and socks, and I placed his
01:35:40.64 --> 01:35:46.40 bare toe inside my jacket right up in my armpit, where it would be able to warm up to body
01:35:46.40 --> 01:35:52.000 temperature naturally. As we waited, I saw another soldier shifting about. He told me his feet
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.04 too were numb. And so after a while, I offered the same service to him, but before along my feet,
01:35:57.04 --> 01:36:02.80 we're also getting so cold, they were excruciating. We needed to move. So once we'd taken a rest,
01:36:02.80 --> 01:36:08.16 we pushed on another hundred meters to a crack. By then, just before the final push to the summit,
01:36:08.16 --> 01:36:13.20 disaster struck. A howling wind flared up the valley, followed immediately by a white blanket of
01:36:13.20 --> 01:36:18.08 cloud. I knew instantly that even if it was short lived, it would add time onto our exposure,
01:36:18.08 --> 01:36:22.80 which might mean the difference between someone keeping or losing their toes to frostbite.
01:36:22.80 --> 01:36:28.40 We had trekked for days and planned for months. No one wanted to give up.
01:36:29.12 --> 01:36:34.24 Boss, one of the soldiers shouted, shouted, we can make it. It's not far to go. 200 meters more.
01:36:34.88 --> 01:36:39.28 I looked up into the murky abyss of frozen air and then back at the faces of the two
01:36:39.28 --> 01:36:44.32 shivering soldiers. I was torn. From the looks around me, it was clear the overwhelming urge
01:36:44.32 --> 01:36:50.000 the group was to continue. These were all paratroopers. Men proud of their own hardiness and
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.72 expecting it above all from me, their leader. But I knew that if I decided to continue,
01:36:56.72 --> 01:37:02.24 I was putting all our safety and danger and the fault would be mine alone for any consequences.
01:37:03.68 --> 01:37:08.40 We turned back. I shouted, now. I hauled the youngest of the crew to his feet and pointed
01:37:08.40 --> 01:37:13.12 down the slope back to where the camp, back to the camp where the shirt was weighted for us.
01:37:13.12 --> 01:37:17.60 The most headstrong of the soldiers muttered and shook his head. I didn't say anything or blame him.
01:37:17.60 --> 01:37:23.12 I was disappointed as he was. We all knew that our chance of conquering the mountain was gone
01:37:23.12 --> 01:37:27.68 at least for this expedition. Months of anticipation and weeks of physical training had gone
01:37:27.68 --> 01:37:33.20 to waste. As we got back to the tents and packed up the camp, we were all silent. It wasn't until
01:37:33.20 --> 01:37:38.72 hours later when we descended beyond the snow line and to a sheltered gully where the sun had
01:37:38.72 --> 01:37:43.92 warmed up the rocks that one of the senior soldiers approached me. You made the right call there,
01:37:43.92 --> 01:37:50.32 boss, otherwise we might have died or at the very least. We'd all be missing a few toes.
01:37:50.32 --> 01:37:55.36 As we carried it on down the trail, the disappointment that we felt that not achieving our aim
01:37:55.36 --> 01:38:00.56 seemed to dissipate and we were glad to have come down unscathed, having lived the fight another day.
01:38:01.68 --> 01:38:06.80 I had not wanted to make the decision to turn back. They felt like failure and I was worried
01:38:06.80 --> 01:38:12.88 about the impact it would have on my soldiers estimation of me. But as I discovered afterwards,
01:38:12.88 --> 01:38:18.40 even those who had wanted to continue at the time had a lot of respect for the decision in hindsight.
01:38:19.52 --> 01:38:24.96 Moreover, that defeat instilled a wonderful attitude in those eight soldiers after the expected
01:38:24.96 --> 01:38:29.76 banter and complaining that all soldiers are good at, every single one of them said that the trip
01:38:29.76 --> 01:38:34.08 was one of the highlights of their military career. What's more, many of them later became
01:38:34.08 --> 01:38:38.24 serious climbers and mountaineers and went back to summit Merra Peak.
01:38:38.24 --> 01:38:46.32 If I had made the popular decision that day rather than the right one, it could have been a very
01:38:46.32 --> 01:38:47.28 different story.
01:38:50.16 --> 01:38:54.40 Just another. And look, I usually say this in the beginning of these things. I'm obviously reading
01:38:54.40 --> 01:38:58.56 only like tiny sections of the book. You got to get the book. There's all kinds of lessons
01:38:58.56 --> 01:39:05.04 learned throughout this book about leadership, about discovery, about exploration. Just it's full of them.
01:39:05.04 --> 01:39:10.96 It's still good the book. But that's a good highlight, a good lesson learned, and this is now.
01:39:10.96 --> 01:39:15.20 And so that's sort of your intro to, well, maybe I can do it, maybe I can do something like this
01:39:15.20 --> 01:39:20.32 in this civilian world. Yeah. It was. And so when I left, when I managed to get out of the,
01:39:20.32 --> 01:39:26.000 um, out of the army, like I said, broke my leg, I was disappointed at not being able to do special
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:30.64 forces selection, but I was still hungry. And that was the, that was the key ingredient because I was
01:39:30.64 --> 01:39:38.24 desperate to do something that I felt was worthwhile. Um, most most of my fellow officers who
01:39:38.24 --> 01:39:45.36 were who left the military, um, at the sort of rank of captain or junior major, they were sort of
01:39:45.36 --> 01:39:49.92 at the process of getting married, setting down and wanting something slightly more stable. You were
01:39:49.92 --> 01:39:54.000 just feeling distantable. And I was just getting water. So a lot of them went to work in London
01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:00.16 and finance or a consultancy, something with a cash. At that stage, I wasn't motivated by
01:40:00.16 --> 01:40:04.24 cash, you know, I just wanted to go and have adventures and approve things. And I was fine.
01:40:04.24 --> 01:40:11.44 You said, I'm going to go have adventure. Yeah, but some of us fun. So I thought there's got to
01:40:11.44 --> 01:40:14.80 be, there's got to be something in this. And so while I was kind of planning on wanting to bring
01:40:14.80 --> 01:40:20.40 together my passions of writing, of, I sort of had an amateur interest in photography, of course,
01:40:20.40 --> 01:40:25.44 travel was kind of at the heart of everything that I did. So I was planning and I was just
01:40:25.44 --> 01:40:30.16 into a friend of mine Tom Bogen, who was, um, and that's also also in the process of, of leaving the
01:40:30.16 --> 01:40:35.28 military. And we came at this idea of setting up some sort of a travel company taking people
01:40:35.28 --> 01:40:41.44 on adventures, expeditions. He saw a few months left to, before he left the military. So in the
01:40:41.44 --> 01:40:47.52 meantime, I volunteered for a, for a charity, a friend of mine had set up a charity in Africa,
01:40:47.52 --> 01:40:52.24 in Malawi. And what they really needed, all the know thing else, was vehicles. They needed a couple
01:40:52.24 --> 01:40:57.04 of ambulances. And so she was like, is there any way you can, you know, somehow, one, you're sitting
01:40:57.04 --> 01:41:01.68 around plotting an extra trip, why not you send me some ambulances, raise some money, or something
01:41:01.68 --> 01:41:06.88 like that. So I said, okay. But we're going to do this the fun way. So I, I basically got together
01:41:06.88 --> 01:41:11.76 a bunch of my friends, um, told them to take two months leave, whatever they were doing. And
01:41:11.76 --> 01:41:18.24 we're going to buy the ambulances on eBay and drive them to Malawi. 10,000 miles away. And that's
01:41:18.24 --> 01:41:22.40 what we did. I managed to raise probably up 50 grand, not a massive amount of money, but bought a
01:41:22.40 --> 01:41:27.68 couple of 20 year old land cruisers off the internet, painted them white, taught myself basic
01:41:27.68 --> 01:41:31.92 mechanics, stuck a flashing light on the top. And off we went. And we drove all the way through
01:41:31.92 --> 01:41:36.96 Europe through the Middle East, went through Syria, you know, all these crazy places and
01:41:36.96 --> 01:41:42.72 two months later went to, you know, finally delivered these ambulances to this little clinic in
01:41:42.72 --> 01:41:48.48 Malawi. And it was such a rewarding experience. I mean, it was a heck of a road trip, but it was, you
01:41:48.48 --> 01:41:52.56 know, it was for a good course. And these ambulances are still being used today to save lives. And
01:41:52.56 --> 01:41:57.28 there was something about that that really, I found really rewarding. And I thought, well, maybe
01:41:57.28 --> 01:42:02.000 if there's a way of commercializing this, I can turn this into a lifestyle. And that's what I did.
01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:07.20 So when Tom finally did leave the army, wind up setting up a company called Supercompers, which basically
01:42:07.20 --> 01:42:13.20 offered military style expeditions in some of the most remote places in the world to civilian
01:42:13.20 --> 01:42:17.04 clients. But with a very military thoughts, we're going from A to B, it's going to be tough.
01:42:17.04 --> 01:42:21.12 Everyone needs to get stuck in. Everyone needs to wash their own dishes. This is not a package
01:42:21.12 --> 01:42:26.72 tool. Let's go. So the first trip, the flagship trip we did was horse riding in Northern Afghanistan.
01:42:26.72 --> 01:42:32.56 Which in 2011 I think that was, I'm hoping to place called the Wakan corridor, which is completely
01:42:32.56 --> 01:42:38.000 unaffected by war and the Taliban. But it was, you know, it sold out. I can't believe it. So the
01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:44.24 how many people? It was only about 12 or so people. So it's small group trips. The next one we did was
01:42:44.24 --> 01:42:50.40 mounting climbing on the Iraq Iran border up in Kurdistan. And that was pretty special too. We're
01:42:50.40 --> 01:42:56.000 going to get across the hard desert in Sudan with camels. We rafed it down the Nile and south
01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:02.16 Sudan, watered across Malagascar, all these sorts of insane trips. But it was so popular. It wasn't
01:43:02.16 --> 01:43:05.84 long before we started getting the likes of Discovery Channel and National Geographic Calling.
01:43:05.84 --> 01:43:09.28 As I'm saying, look, we've seen these kind of trips that you can do. Can you take our journalists
01:43:09.28 --> 01:43:13.52 and our film crews. So that was a bit of a segue into the world of media. And before we knew it,
01:43:13.52 --> 01:43:20.32 we were taking these highly respected film crews and journalists and directors into Syria, Iraq, wherever
01:43:20.32 --> 01:43:25.20 you want it to go. And we met all sorts of people. I mean, I ended up doing sort of a security for
01:43:25.20 --> 01:43:30.000 George Clooney at one point. It was wild. But that was how it sort of led on to.
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:35.28 Easy and actor or something or a politician. George Clooney. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I was an average
01:43:35.28 --> 01:43:39.68 bit of by the Disney. Moving on. Yeah, Coach Ross. Yes, check.
01:43:40.88 --> 01:43:46.48 That was the movie you said. It was like, hey, yeah. At some point, I think it was 2010, you
01:43:46.48 --> 01:43:53.04 started writing your first book. Yes. And you write about it in this book. You write about
01:43:53.04 --> 01:43:57.12 writing your first book. And one of the things you say, you're like talking about the challenge
01:43:57.12 --> 01:44:03.20 of writing a book. And the quote that I liked was you said, are you really going to feel more inspired
01:44:03.20 --> 01:44:07.20 tomorrow? Or do you just need to be firm with yourself and get started? It's going to again,
01:44:07.20 --> 01:44:11.20 it's rationalization. Well, I really don't feel like writing to today. Maybe I can wait until tomorrow.
01:44:12.40 --> 01:44:16.48 So you started writing this book. And you go through your methods, you know, with some, you know,
01:44:16.48 --> 01:44:25.36 about how you lay it out and your very methodical about your writing. How that book, you know,
01:44:25.36 --> 01:44:30.24 what, what do publishers just jumped all over that one, huh? Sadly not. So this was when I was
01:44:30.24 --> 01:44:33.84 trying to set up a business. I was trying to have fun. I was trying to get over the fact that I
01:44:33.84 --> 01:44:37.84 left the army and wasn't, I hadn't quite achieved what we want to do. So I thought, okay, what
01:44:37.84 --> 01:44:41.84 I'm going to do is going to write about that trick that we discussed before when I hitchhiked to
01:44:41.84 --> 01:44:47.60 India. Because I thought it was interesting. Whether anyone else did was another matter. I wrote
01:44:47.60 --> 01:44:55.76 this book, 100,000 words, pitched it to agents, publishers, and basically got told to piss off at every
01:44:55.76 --> 01:45:03.28 turn. Nobody was interested. Nobody cares about your holidays. So it was quite disappointing.
01:45:03.28 --> 01:45:10.64 But I'd written 100,000 words. It was on my laptop. And I thought, okay, maybe this book's not good enough.
01:45:10.64 --> 01:45:16.40 But it's been a really useful learning curve. It's given me an introduction to writing and the process.
01:45:16.40 --> 01:45:22.88 And that inspired me to carry on. And I knew I needed to do something that was more impressive.
01:45:22.88 --> 01:45:30.000 Something that would get picked up. And that's how it led on to the bigger expeditions later on.
01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:34.000 So you were thinking, I've got to do cooler stuff. If I'm going to write a book about it and
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:38.80 people are actually going to be interested. Exactly. What was the first step towards that?
01:45:38.80 --> 01:45:41.84 What was the trick that you said, all right, this is worth writing about?
01:45:41.84 --> 01:45:47.12 So like I say, I was doing a really harsh writing. I've got to understand. Well, no,
01:45:47.12 --> 01:45:51.20 none of those were big or bold enough. They were all cool trips. But they were too. They were still too
01:45:51.20 --> 01:45:55.60 weak. You know, trips. Oh, you said two weeks. Two weeks. Yeah, these were all like short trips
01:45:55.60 --> 01:46:00.16 that paying clients could come on. And whilst it was fun guiding trips for paying clients,
01:46:00.16 --> 01:46:05.20 it wasn't the kind of stuff that I could write about. But it was all, it was all leading in the
01:46:05.20 --> 01:46:11.76 directions. Well, you guys profitable. Quite the opposite. So I was, I was homeless. I spent three
01:46:11.76 --> 01:46:16.88 years. Oh, you've been homeless until I've worked here. No, but this was proper home. I had,
01:46:17.68 --> 01:46:21.84 I had basically whatever money I'd saved up from the army. I'd invested into this company with my
01:46:21.84 --> 01:46:26.88 buddy, which meant I didn't have any money for rent. So I was basically staying on friends floors
01:46:28.08 --> 01:46:34.16 for three years. But I also had a rule that I'd learned in India. I'd stayed at a good war at the
01:46:34.16 --> 01:46:39.36 the Golden Temple in India. And it's part of the Sikh religion to off-a-hospitality.
01:46:39.36 --> 01:46:44.72 But only for three days and three nights after that, you can move on. So I adopted this,
01:46:44.72 --> 01:46:49.12 I quite liked that because you don't want to like, you know, sort of burn your bridges or
01:46:49.12 --> 01:46:53.60 or outstage or welcome. So I adopted this mentality and I was pretty rigid with it. So for three
01:46:53.60 --> 01:46:57.36 years, I never spent more than three nights in one place. So I stayed with friends and even if they
01:46:57.36 --> 01:47:02.000 insisted, I stayed longer, I said, now I'm going to move on. So I kind of did the big rotation.
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.56 Oh, my friends and London. But it did mean that there was a few occasions where there was gaps.
01:47:06.56 --> 01:47:13.12 So I slept on benches. I'll be honest. I slept outside and whatever it took. And it was a pretty
01:47:13.12 --> 01:47:17.04 tough experience because I was kind of living on one or two meals a day, maximum because that's
01:47:17.04 --> 01:47:22.56 all I could afford, especially in London. It's not cheap. And then I was surviving by going away
01:47:22.56 --> 01:47:26.96 on these short expeditions, where at least my expenses are paid for. You're stoked to go to Afghanistan
01:47:26.96 --> 01:47:30.72 and ride a horse so you can get a meal. Just suck you get fed. Yeah, for sure. And then,
01:47:30.72 --> 01:47:34.80 but whenever I was back in London for like a week or two weeks, I was poor. I had no money.
01:47:34.80 --> 01:47:39.36 What was the uptempo of these trips? How often are you going on those? A lot. You know, it would be
01:47:39.36 --> 01:47:44.000 a beer way for two or three weeks. Then back for a couple of weeks and a wave. So it was basically
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.08 nine or ten months of the year. I was away. Why wasn't the company profitable? I mean, I would
01:47:48.08 --> 01:47:52.88 imagine your clientele must have been people with a lot of money and for them the difference between
01:47:52.88 --> 01:47:56.64 but how much sort of cost? If I wanted to go horseback riding and have Ganeshan, what were you going to
01:47:56.64 --> 01:48:01.36 charge about? Well, it's probably two or three thousand pounds, so five thousand dollars. Okay. So not
01:48:01.36 --> 01:48:05.84 super money. I mean, we were aiming at that high inclined talent, but at that stage, we just didn't
01:48:05.84 --> 01:48:09.52 have the contacts. We didn't know that those circles of people. So we were trying to hammer
01:48:09.52 --> 01:48:13.92 it the more midrange budgets. People who were adventurous who had a bit of cash, but not we're not
01:48:13.92 --> 01:48:17.92 talking billionaires here. We're talking, you know, people at work in the city. I mean, we had
01:48:17.92 --> 01:48:22.80 also people, teachers. I mean, people who just saved up all the earth to do that one particular trip.
01:48:22.80 --> 01:48:27.76 What about your buddy Todd? Tom. Tom. What about him? Where's he living? Well, he was married. So
01:48:27.76 --> 01:48:32.48 he sort of, you know, he'd already sort of managed to game self sorted. So he had to have some
01:48:32.48 --> 01:48:39.12 with a live on like me. So we were in slightly different places. But for me, it was like, you know,
01:48:39.12 --> 01:48:43.76 I was using all of these trips as an opportunity to learn the craft of riding to do more photography.
01:48:43.76 --> 01:48:48.08 So I'd go away and do this horse riding and Afghanistan takes some photographs and I'd try and sell them
01:48:48.08 --> 01:48:52.40 to, you know, lonely planet guidebooks or the newspapers, whatever it might be. So I was trying to build
01:48:52.40 --> 01:48:55.44 up a single piece of stuff. Really? Really baits on that? Yeah, what? It took a while. I mean, I was
01:48:55.44 --> 01:49:01.04 doing my first show of weddings and baby photos, but it all, it was all building up. But it was
01:49:01.04 --> 01:49:08.08 on one of these trips. I was out in South Sudan doing a making a film out there. It was a fishing
01:49:08.08 --> 01:49:13.12 show about a guy that was fishing for an hour per each in the middle of a war zone. The only
01:49:13.12 --> 01:49:17.92 one was he, he didn't really catch any fish, which doesn't make for a particularly good fishing show.
01:49:19.20 --> 01:49:23.04 And when we were back in Juba, which I don't know if you've been to Juba, but it's, it's,
01:49:23.04 --> 01:49:26.80 there's nothing there. I mean, it's, it, the world's news country at the time, South Sudan.
01:49:27.52 --> 01:49:31.52 It had about three miles of paved road in the entire country. I mean, even in the city centre,
01:49:31.52 --> 01:49:35.92 it was just like dirt, huts. So pretty rudimentary place. We were out there trying to make a
01:49:35.92 --> 01:49:39.12 show about fishing, but having not caught any fish. The whole thing was a bit of a disaster.
01:49:39.12 --> 01:49:46.24 Turns out that George Clooney was in town doing some of his humanitarian work. And he, he'd landed,
01:49:46.24 --> 01:49:49.68 we tried to get him on the show. We thought at least if we got George Clooney in the film, it's kind of
01:49:49.68 --> 01:49:55.28 a self, just for the, like, that he's in it. The only problem is that the camera man who was supposed
01:49:55.28 --> 01:49:58.32 to be filming George Clooney, because it was so star-struck, turns out halfway through the
01:49:58.32 --> 01:50:03.36 interview to God's press record. So that was a disaster as well. But we were out there. We,
01:50:03.36 --> 01:50:08.000 kind of, as a reputation with it within the film crew, we thought this, this whole thing's a
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.80 complete mess, this shambles. And we're going to go back to Channel 4 who commissioned this thing
01:50:12.80 --> 01:50:18.56 with our reputation in tatters at this point. So they commissioned your company to film this?
01:50:18.56 --> 01:50:22.64 Wasn't my company. I was just freelance, health and safety guy. I was, you know,
01:50:22.64 --> 01:50:26.72 pot of secret compass, but we'd, you know, we'd basically sort of thought that. You got contracted out.
01:50:26.72 --> 01:50:30.96 Yeah. So, so Channel 4 is paying someone else to make this show. To make the show.
01:50:30.96 --> 01:50:35.04 And you're just a helper. I was a helper doing all the behind the scenes, logistics, safety,
01:50:35.04 --> 01:50:40.16 keeping people fed and more. And you recognize that this isn't going well. This guy hasn't caught
01:50:40.16 --> 01:50:44.16 the freaking fish yet. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't got a fish. George Clooney got a two.
01:50:44.16 --> 01:50:47.60 Show up. Yeah, exactly. I ended up having to be George Clooney's hand double,
01:50:47.60 --> 01:50:50.96 because they screwed up the first start of the interview. I mean, it was like,
01:50:50.96 --> 01:50:54.88 it was pretty bad. But that's how I met a guy called Neil. He was the second,
01:50:55.44 --> 01:51:00.96 he was the producer director on the show, second cameraman. And he said, look,
01:51:00.96 --> 01:51:05.44 look, you know, we could do this ourselves. Why don't we film one of your expeditions?
01:51:06.40 --> 01:51:10.24 You know, cut the crap. Let's go and do something cool. He said, if you got any ideas,
01:51:10.24 --> 01:51:13.04 and we were in South Sudan on the banks of the night. I was sort of looked left and right.
01:51:13.04 --> 01:51:16.72 So it's whopping great. Rick River, I said, well, I wonder if anyone's ever walked the length of
01:51:16.72 --> 01:51:21.44 the river Nile? And he said, well, I'd hardly doubt it. Because it's four or half thousand miles long.
01:51:21.44 --> 01:51:26.000 I'm full of war zones. So I said, well, let's do it. And so that's where the idea was born.
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.16 And I decided I wanted to be the first person to walk the entire length of the river Nile.
01:51:30.80 --> 01:51:34.80 And I thought that's that's big enough and bold enough to write a book about and get published.
01:51:35.92 --> 01:51:40.64 So that was the plan. And that was the plan. That was back in 2012. And it took me about
01:51:41.52 --> 01:51:46.16 almost two years, only 18 months of planning, fundraising, trying to get TV interest,
01:51:46.16 --> 01:51:50.40 trying to get a publisher, all that sort of stuff. But I was determined that come up with out.
01:51:50.40 --> 01:51:54.96 Even if we don't get the support of TV or a book, I'm going to go and do this. And just by
01:51:54.96 --> 01:52:00.56 committing mentally, I think that's what did it. It was the confidence of then just walking into these
01:52:00.56 --> 01:52:05.76 meetings saying, screw you, even if you don't give me any money, I'm doing it. And I think people saw that
01:52:05.76 --> 01:52:11.20 and the sort of the, I guess the credibility of having been a power trooper that got people bought
01:52:11.20 --> 01:52:16.72 into this vision. And somehow, I managed to get a TV commission, a book publishing deal and everything
01:52:16.72 --> 01:52:20.88 else. And got the whole thing fully funded. And so if I went, took nine months, walked four and
01:52:20.88 --> 01:52:27.76 half thousand miles from Rwanda through Tanzania, through Uganda, South Sudan, all the way to the
01:52:27.76 --> 01:52:34.24 Mediterranean in Egypt. And that was a, that was a rough one. I mean, I know, in reading through this,
01:52:35.12 --> 01:52:38.56 you had one of the guys that was with you guy, Matt, Matt, Matthew, power.
01:52:38.56 --> 01:52:45.84 Yeah, Matthew, he was a journalist and yeah, he came out to write about me for a magazine
01:52:47.28 --> 01:52:52.40 and sadly passed away from Heathrow, on the way. And that was a real kick at the ass because,
01:52:53.12 --> 01:52:59.20 it brought it home that this was real. This wasn't just some trip away, stuff can go wrong
01:52:59.20 --> 01:53:04.000 and sadly does go wrong sometimes. But it really brought it home. And it made me really question
01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:10.16 the validity of this. You know, what was what I was doing right, you know, but you know, it happened
01:53:10.16 --> 01:53:16.000 and I thought, I've got to carry on to, I've got to finish this. There is legacy as much as anything
01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:22.88 else to make, if I give up now, then what was the whole point in any of it? So, so this was,
01:53:24.64 --> 01:53:29.28 so a TV crew is with you and they're filming? That's the whole time. No, I mean, the journey,
01:53:29.28 --> 01:53:33.52 at the time when I set off, I didn't know how long this would take. I'd anticipated about a year
01:53:34.24 --> 01:53:39.76 and you know, you can't afford to pay a crew for a 12-month to follow me around. So they came out
01:53:39.76 --> 01:53:45.20 four or five times for anywhere between three or four days in a week. So they were only on the ground,
01:53:45.52 --> 01:53:51.44 probably a total of about a month out of the nine months that I was on my own, all with local guides,
01:53:51.44 --> 01:53:55.84 you know, I was always trying to have a local person with me as an accompaniment, but places like Sudan,
01:53:55.84 --> 01:54:00.16 they couldn't even get in because they weren't issuing journalists visa. So I was on my own
01:54:00.16 --> 01:54:07.84 for like two months in Sudan. How many miles were you doing a day? So I started to do
01:54:07.84 --> 01:54:14.80 probably 10 miles a day in places like Rwando, where it's quite hilly, but when I was really into my
01:54:14.80 --> 01:54:21.68 stride in the desert in Sudan, I mean it was hot, it was sort of August, September time, with 120
01:54:21.68 --> 01:54:28.80 degrees in the desert, but probably averaging 45 to 50 kilometers, so 30 miles a day.
01:54:30.08 --> 01:54:35.04 And then this TV show, this is a TV show, better eventually. So as a veteran,
01:54:35.04 --> 01:54:42.40 no, it's a four-pot series walking the Nile, which then aired in the UK, and in the states and globally,
01:54:42.40 --> 01:54:47.20 and it was a huge success, far more than I'd ever anticipated. But it became a bestseller,
01:54:47.20 --> 01:54:52.000 and yeah, it changed my life, suddenly wasn't homeless anymore.
01:54:54.24 --> 01:54:59.52 When is it like on Netflix, where do you watch it? It was on Discovery Channel in the US,
01:54:59.52 --> 01:55:04.08 it was on Channel 4 in the UK, but you know, you can still find it on line here, still out there.
01:55:04.08 --> 01:55:08.24 Did you feel like these bastards that filmed it only came on this thing for like three weeks?
01:55:08.24 --> 01:55:13.52 Now's out there for nine months? Well, we all became friends and actually to this day, like Neil,
01:55:13.52 --> 01:55:19.36 who is the guy who originally inspired me to do this for TV. We're still, you know, best buddies,
01:55:19.36 --> 01:55:24.48 and I've now set up my own production company, so I make shows for other people and for myself as well,
01:55:24.48 --> 01:55:30.000 and he's on the team. So yeah, we all became very close, so I'm new tend to when you're in those sort of
01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.80 circumstances. I mean, we were in South Sudan, in the middle of a war zone, you know, it was,
01:55:34.80 --> 01:55:38.80 I mean, they weren't there at the time, it was just me, but, um,
01:55:38.80 --> 01:55:42.96 I was going to say, because you become close and then they're like, hey, I'm out. I'm back there.
01:55:42.96 --> 01:55:46.40 Two months, well, all the exciting things happened. All the exciting things happened where they
01:55:46.40 --> 01:55:50.56 weren't there. I mean, we were in a place called Bore. This was during the, um, just the, uh,
01:55:50.56 --> 01:55:55.20 the sort of, uh, there's big, big civil war happening in South Sudan. It was, um,
01:55:55.20 --> 01:55:58.96 they just got the new country, but there's still a lot of tribal fighting. I turned up in this
01:55:58.96 --> 01:56:04.80 town called Bore, uh, the same morning that 60 members of a tribe had been murdered inside a
01:56:04.80 --> 01:56:09.92 inside the United Nations refugee camp. Um, do it. The whole thing was kicking off. I found myself
01:56:09.92 --> 01:56:14.72 on top of a, you know, that this bombed out hotel with the rebels approaching on one side,
01:56:14.72 --> 01:56:19.44 you know, Tracer Firegown over heads. There was mortars landing nearby in the only alternative
01:56:19.44 --> 01:56:23.52 pop from watching the fire. It was climbing down the ladder into the river now, which was filled
01:56:23.52 --> 01:56:28.72 with crocodiles. So it was, it was a pretty hairy time. And lots of things, you know, like I said,
01:56:28.72 --> 01:56:37.36 counting and do go wrong, but turns out that makes for good TV. Then you, so you get done with that.
01:56:37.36 --> 01:56:43.04 You, you got a place to live now. You're kind of going in a different direction as far as
01:56:43.04 --> 01:56:48.40 fighting hands with. Uh, but now you got to start plotting on things. Like, are you thinking of
01:56:48.40 --> 01:56:54.40 yourself? All right, I got to one up myself. Well, it came pretty quickly, you know, the, the show
01:56:54.40 --> 01:56:59.36 was successful. Um, I was then asked, you know, literally a couple months later, where's next?
01:56:59.36 --> 01:57:03.04 And of course, people won't be going better. I thought, and I've just walked into the river
01:57:03.04 --> 01:57:07.84 and I'll be, what's bigger and better than that? So I thought, well, what I'm going to do is,
01:57:07.84 --> 01:57:12.32 I don't want to be a one hit wonder or a sort of flash the pan, I need to sort of think the
01:57:12.32 --> 01:57:19.84 long game. So I, I sort of squared it away in my mind, the kind of journeys that I want to do,
01:57:19.84 --> 01:57:24.64 the kind of places that I want to visit. And I wrote down sort of my values, the things that I will
01:57:24.64 --> 01:57:30.32 not move away from. And it was actually going back to my degree in my degree at university. I,
01:57:30.32 --> 01:57:35.28 I'm going to, I'm going to visit places that hold a genuine interest. Um, because at this stage,
01:57:35.28 --> 01:57:40.40 I was getting all sorts of offers to go build, you know, sort of log cabins in, in the woods in Alaska
01:57:40.40 --> 01:57:46.24 and do fishing shows and do cooking shows, all of which are great and interesting. But if I was to
01:57:46.24 --> 01:57:52.40 actually see this as a long term career, I need to sort of call my own niche. And so, um, I thought by
01:57:52.40 --> 01:57:58.000 doing journeys, either on foot or certainly at the slowest pace into places that I've got
01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:03.12 bit of a bad reputation, there's, there's an interesting way of shining a spotlight on places that
01:58:03.12 --> 01:58:08.40 really need it. So I thought, why not pick a geographical feature? I, the Himalayas,
01:58:08.40 --> 01:58:12.16 see in the next obvious choice, the biggest mountain range in the world, mountain Everest,
01:58:12.16 --> 01:58:17.52 and walk the length of that. So I thought I'm going to start at the place that plays very close to my
01:58:17.52 --> 01:58:22.000 heart. I've got my stand in the Pami amount in some walk all the way to the Tibetan plateau. And
01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:26.24 that was another journey of, two and a half or three thousand miles. And that took about six months
01:58:26.24 --> 01:58:30.64 as well. So that was the next big journey which happened 12 months later. And then ever since then,
01:58:30.64 --> 01:58:34.96 I've been doing one big journey pretty much every year since then. Are you going to sort, were you
01:58:34.96 --> 01:58:39.44 solo when you are in the aisle? Uh, well, like I said, I always have a local guide. They were,
01:58:39.44 --> 01:58:43.84 they would change over depending on which country I was in. So I was able to do the entire.
01:58:43.84 --> 01:58:46.88 What about the Himalayas, solo? Uh, again. Other than,
01:58:46.88 --> 01:58:51.76 local guide. Yeah, and the crew would fly out and meet me along the way to film what they thought
01:58:51.76 --> 01:58:56.24 with the bankers. And then, but it, you know, it's always the way that the most interesting
01:58:56.24 --> 01:59:00.48 stuff happens when you're on your own or in a very small crew, because the moment you've got a car,
01:59:00.48 --> 01:59:05.20 with the crew there, things are not quite the same. People sort of close a bit and they're not as
01:59:05.20 --> 01:59:10.56 open. So, a lot of the interesting stuff happens, you know, when you're unaccompanied,
01:59:10.56 --> 01:59:16.40 which is what happened when I was in Nepal and my car has, the one time, the irony of a walking
01:59:16.40 --> 01:59:22.000 expedition is the one time that I decided to get an attack that he, because I was told I couldn't
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:25.84 camp in it in this particular village and I had to move on to the next. That was when I had
01:59:25.84 --> 01:59:28.80 a pretty big accident. Yeah, I talked a talkerously. You read about it in the book,
01:59:28.80 --> 01:59:36.72 I'll talk us through that one. So, it was, I'll never forget it. I was the 90th August, 2015. I was,
01:59:36.72 --> 01:59:42.08 I was in a town called Musicot with my local guide, Binod, and actually my brother who'd flown out
01:59:42.08 --> 01:59:49.92 to meet me a day before to join me for a week of what was his annual holiday. I know the story,
01:59:49.92 --> 01:59:54.64 so I think it's a bad and your brother. Yeah, cool. You're on classification? Yeah. So,
01:59:54.64 --> 02:00:01.28 so we're in the mountains and it was just, it was almost night time, it was getting dark and most of
02:00:01.28 --> 02:00:05.84 the time, you know, I'd already been walking for three months here. We just camp in villages or stay
02:00:05.84 --> 02:00:10.40 in locals houses, whatever it, whatever it took. But there was a mal-est interaction in this
02:00:10.40 --> 02:00:14.96 pot of Nepal, so the communists were taken over villages and they didn't take kindly to
02:00:14.96 --> 02:00:18.96 foreigners, because you know, they just said, and they weren't aggressive, they just said,
02:00:18.96 --> 02:00:23.28 look, you can't stay here, go to the town and then you can come back to my own car room,
02:00:23.28 --> 02:00:28.000 you walk, but you can't stay in this village because we're having an internal dispute. So we said
02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.80 fine, so we got a local taxi, got in it, drove over the mountain pass and just as we were
02:00:32.80 --> 02:00:40.000 going over the crest of the cliff, the brakes failed. So the car goes careering down this, this, this,
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:46.48 this road and unable to slow down, hits the side of the wall and bounces straight off this,
02:00:46.48 --> 02:00:52.72 this cliff top. And when I say cliff top, it was, it was a huge fall, straight into the forest,
02:00:52.72 --> 02:01:00.48 below about 150 meters, which is what's that, 450 feet to the bottom of the gorge and somehow,
02:01:00.48 --> 02:01:04.80 again, thank you, Malakistan's. Do you ever see Belpaan? There were no seat belts in this car,
02:01:04.80 --> 02:01:08.40 I mean, it's a, I guess the inner bend is one part of the tension, there were her bags.
02:01:08.40 --> 02:01:13.60 What kind of car was it? It was a Mahindra Jeep, so it was a metal frame, thankfully, not some,
02:01:13.60 --> 02:01:18.56 not some cheap stuff, but it was, yeah, it was a straight off the edge and that was me, I thought
02:01:18.56 --> 02:01:23.44 this is a long, how long were you no brick, I'm rolling out the hill. I'm difficult to tell,
02:01:23.44 --> 02:01:28.24 I think probably 10 seconds, I mean, the driver was trying to bounce it against the wall to slow it down,
02:01:28.24 --> 02:01:34.000 but you can imagine these roads, it's just a dirt track, sheer, sheer sort of rock face on the one hand
02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:39.12 and then a drop off, no barriers, nothing like that, and it was just a completely pitch of pitch black
02:01:39.12 --> 02:01:45.12 middle of the night. And that was it, I thought I was a goner and it was almost
02:01:45.12 --> 02:01:51.60 comedic in the sense that it didn't, it literally flew off the edge and we were airborne for
02:01:51.60 --> 02:01:56.48 what felt like an eternity, it was probably just a few seconds, but it was the only part of the,
02:01:58.16 --> 02:02:01.68 the road side where there were no trees because it was forested this, this bank,
02:02:02.80 --> 02:02:06.56 but we went off the bit where there was obviously a river running through, so it just kept on going
02:02:06.56 --> 02:02:11.28 and when we finally did hit the deck, it bounced and rolled and probably rolled 10 times,
02:02:11.28 --> 02:02:17.44 always the bottom of the valley and somehow I stayed in the vehicle, the driver and this random
02:02:17.44 --> 02:02:23.60 other guy that he picked up a local had been thrown through the windscreen somewhere up on the mountain,
02:02:23.60 --> 02:02:30.24 we stayed in the car and yeah, made it always the bottom, at which point I thought I'd lost my
02:02:30.24 --> 02:02:36.48 arm because I couldn't feel it or see it, my money stick. When the car settles, yeah, when it finally
02:02:36.48 --> 02:02:42.80 settles, are you conscious of all time? What are you saying to your brother besides it,
02:02:42.80 --> 02:02:46.96 bro, I'm sorry. Well, it was, I can thank my brother because
02:02:48.64 --> 02:02:53.52 when I, when I sort of figured out where I was, I crawled out the car, thought I'd lost my arm,
02:02:53.52 --> 02:02:57.36 my first instinct was to go find my arm, you know, it's seen on the beach and saving
02:02:57.36 --> 02:03:02.08 private Ryan, where he's looking, he's looking like days and confused, that was me in this car,
02:03:02.08 --> 02:03:05.28 I couldn't find it, then I realized it was still attached, but I couldn't feel it, it was
02:03:05.28 --> 02:03:08.88 pointing the wrong way, it was completely, I mean you can see the scar there,
02:03:10.64 --> 02:03:14.64 I had to sort of snap it back into place, that's when the pain started and I think it was me
02:03:14.64 --> 02:03:21.68 screaming that woke my brother up and he was relatively un-ingered, I mean he'd been bashed around,
02:03:21.68 --> 02:03:25.76 but he hadn't got anything broken, so I couldn't move, I was in such pain, been odd, the guide,
02:03:25.76 --> 02:03:34.000 he was pretty much unconscious and Pete, my brother, he came over and, you know, he's done a
02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:38.32 few trips, but nothing like this, you know, he used working in finance, you know, he's sort of
02:03:38.32 --> 02:03:43.60 for, he's back in finance, you know, well, no, it's the interesting thing, whilst Pete rescued us,
02:03:43.60 --> 02:03:48.24 he went and shouted for help, luckily the sound of the car crashing had woken up some local
02:03:48.24 --> 02:03:53.12 villagers and my, they'd come to investigate, probably to go out and how I may be for
02:03:53.12 --> 02:03:58.24 enough locals to come to carriers out, but then they had to carriers and my, through the jungle,
02:03:58.24 --> 02:04:03.60 to the local village, well you weren't bleeding, I mean, I wasn't bleeding,
02:04:03.60 --> 02:04:06.96 but I was bleeding bleeding, like you weren't, like threatening blood, no, it was just my
02:04:06.96 --> 02:04:12.96 arm was just completely mangled, the driver sadly was in a very different position he'd broken,
02:04:12.96 --> 02:04:16.16 everything is body, it's neck, you know, he was somewhere at the mountains, that's going to
02:04:16.16 --> 02:04:20.72 find him, we were taken to a very small clinic in the local village, and when I say small
02:04:20.72 --> 02:04:25.44 owners like chicken running around the ward, this was basic stuff, but luckily they're, yes,
02:04:25.44 --> 02:04:31.04 they're qualified, it was basic, they were rolling the hospital and chickens, but they had more
02:04:31.04 --> 02:04:36.48 feet, thankfully, so that, you know, took away some of the pain, but yeah my brother, he
02:04:36.48 --> 02:04:40.32 coordinates the rescue, took three days though because it was the rainy season we couldn't get
02:04:40.32 --> 02:04:45.28 helicopter in the road to all washed away, so it took three days for helicopters to come, so
02:04:45.68 --> 02:04:50.88 it was a, it was a trying time, so the least, and I think my brother was possibly regretting his
02:04:50.88 --> 02:04:56.24 his holiday distillation, but yeah, he was a real trooper throughout the whole experience,
02:04:56.24 --> 02:05:02.16 and yeah, so that, that really disrupted the trip a little bit, but I had to fly back to the UK
02:05:02.16 --> 02:05:06.40 for surgery because they couldn't do it in count on due because it was just after the 2015 earthquake
02:05:06.40 --> 02:05:12.56 which had screwed all the hospitals, so I went back to the UK, had surgery for the fix my own,
02:05:12.56 --> 02:05:16.40 but then I couldn't give up, this was my, I'd chosen this, this was my career, I wasn't going to give
02:05:16.40 --> 02:05:22.80 up, so whatever it was, 45 days later I flew back out to Nepal, went back to the car, still there
02:05:22.80 --> 02:05:30.64 in the jungle, rusting over and carried on walking, from another three months, the TV show came out,
02:05:30.64 --> 02:05:33.84 yeah, they came out, they enjoyed that, they like they filmed me in the hospital,
02:05:33.84 --> 02:05:39.36 gave surgery at all, rest of it, and then this becomes another TV show and did you write another
02:05:39.36 --> 02:05:44.80 book about this? Yeah, wrote a book, yeah, called Walk in Himalayas, give it simple, and then they
02:05:44.80 --> 02:05:50.16 of course they said, what's next, so I had to come up with another one, you're paying yourself
02:05:50.16 --> 02:05:56.000 into a corner, Matt? Yeah, absolutely, so what was the next one? Walking the Americas, so I
02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:59.84 wanted to do something in Central America, I'd have this girl from this Mexican girlfriend,
02:05:59.84 --> 02:06:06.40 so I knew Mexico quite well, but I was fascinated by the ancient mine civilization, I wanted to go
02:06:06.40 --> 02:06:13.44 to see places like Honduras and got a Marlera in Colombia because I knew that I would have a bit of
02:06:13.44 --> 02:06:20.16 edge, and so I decided to walk from where the Spanish first landed in the U.C. temperature, give it a bit of
02:06:20.16 --> 02:06:25.92 historical context all the way to South America across the Daryngap, which is probably one of
02:06:25.92 --> 02:06:30.000 the most remote and fierce, most stretch of the jungle, anywhere in the world, so that was another
02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:36.16 six months, another two thousand miles of walking, again, lots of scrapes there as well. And this is the
02:06:36.16 --> 02:06:40.96 same thing, TV crews coming out joining you for four or five days here and there, wherever they think
02:06:40.96 --> 02:06:45.28 there's going to be the most, to mayhem, that's when they're showing up, you're carrying a freaking
02:06:45.28 --> 02:06:55.12 backpack with like a water bottle, and 50 bucks. Yeah, yeah, and off we went, and that was a
02:06:55.12 --> 02:07:00.16 really enjoyable journey because the guy that came with me might my guide for that one was actually
02:07:00.16 --> 02:07:04.80 a guy who had known for a number of years called Alberto, who was the guy that got me into photography
02:07:04.80 --> 02:07:09.44 in the first place and he'd lived in Mexico, he'd never walked anywhere in his life, anywhere,
02:07:09.44 --> 02:07:13.60 and he certainly wasn't a professional guide, he was a studio photographer, he was far more at home,
02:07:13.60 --> 02:07:18.48 sitting on yachts with supermodels, but he had just got divorced and was looking for an adventure,
02:07:18.48 --> 02:07:22.72 so I said, let me come with me, we're going to go and have some fun, and off we went and we walked
02:07:22.72 --> 02:07:28.16 for six months through all these random countries and we went through the ganglands in Honduras,
02:07:28.88 --> 02:07:35.52 met the cartels along the way, we sort of had meetings with all sorts of gangsters,
02:07:35.52 --> 02:07:42.16 it was, that was a wild trip as well. What about a GoPro? I, so I had this little flip camera,
02:07:42.16 --> 02:07:46.08 that you're the interesting thing is actually you'd think sometimes that it would be tricky
02:07:46.08 --> 02:07:52.16 to film in these places, but actually having a camera does open up conversations, people are like,
02:07:52.16 --> 02:07:56.96 oh hang on, I want my first graph taken, or I want you to, I want to tell you my story,
02:07:56.96 --> 02:08:01.20 and particularly in places that don't get many tourists, because if you go to touristy places,
02:08:01.20 --> 02:08:06.56 people aren't that interesting, get the photos taken or telling you their story, but if you go to
02:08:06.56 --> 02:08:12.48 Honduras, I mean there's one story from there, we were in a town called San Pedro Sula,
02:08:12.48 --> 02:08:18.000 which other than Ciada Twaras, I think was the murder capital of the world, this is where the two
02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:24.96 main cartels you've got, MS 13 and Barrio 18, these two rival gangs that do pretty bad things to
02:08:24.96 --> 02:08:32.40 each other are based, they've got their own neighbourhoods, and we wanted to walk straight through
02:08:32.40 --> 02:08:36.72 this city, and the only way to do so was to cross between these two ganglands, but of course the
02:08:36.72 --> 02:08:41.60 police and the army were like, look, we don't go in there, we can't rely on us for backing. So we
02:08:41.60 --> 02:08:45.68 asked around and Alberto was sort of doing all the translation and we eventually found this street
02:08:45.68 --> 02:08:50.48 pastor who said, look, I know the gang leaders are both of these guys, I can probably get you in
02:08:50.48 --> 02:08:55.44 if you want, so I'll ask the question, so he got his, he got two phones out actually, and he
02:08:55.44 --> 02:08:59.76 called the leaders of both gangs and had them on speaker phone next to each other, which is
02:08:59.76 --> 02:09:06.08 bizarre, both of these leaders were both in jail, right, because they were, and he got them,
02:09:06.08 --> 02:09:10.08 they were, and he got them both on speaker phone and said, look, I've got these two two
02:09:10.08 --> 02:09:14.80 gringoes, I mean he wasn't malbusters, and Mexican, but he called us both gringoes and said, look,
02:09:14.80 --> 02:09:22.16 they want to walk through your turf, you know, will you let them, and to my surprise,
02:09:22.16 --> 02:09:27.36 these both these leaders like, yeah, absolutely, you know, as long as you give a fair honest
02:09:27.36 --> 02:09:32.16 representation of our story, you want to tell you our story, and why we have these gangs,
02:09:32.16 --> 02:09:35.36 but he said, just give us twenty fryzers because we're just going to even clean up the graffiti
02:09:35.36 --> 02:09:39.60 and pick up the trash from the streets, they wanted to show the best side of their gang walls,
02:09:39.60 --> 02:09:44.80 and it was the most bizarre experience, but we went through these areas, escorted by these kids,
02:09:44.80 --> 02:09:49.52 ten, twelve year olds, we had covered in tattoos with pistols down there jeans,
02:09:50.32 --> 02:09:54.64 and they showed us the Castle O'Cuz, the Crazy House, where they taught each other,
02:09:54.64 --> 02:09:59.20 and they, they should, oh, this is where we killed, you know, this person, this is where we
02:09:59.20 --> 02:10:05.44 hung, it was like tragic stuff, but in the most surreal setting, and it was, it was a very bizarre
02:10:05.44 --> 02:10:10.32 experience to go and see that, and we saw a guy shot at the side of the street, you know, just in,
02:10:10.32 --> 02:10:16.72 just, yeah, from the gang walls, so, and, and I'm not into voyeurism, I don't go there to sort of
02:10:16.72 --> 02:10:22.24 glamorize any of this, it's trying to show what, you know, the, what the struggle is like for a
02:10:22.24 --> 02:10:26.72 lot of people living in these circumstances and, and not shy away from some of those really difficult
02:10:27.36 --> 02:10:32.48 but compelling stories. Now, did you, did you have a film crew there when you did that section?
02:10:32.48 --> 02:10:36.80 They, they had come out and, and we had a real struggle with the channel to, to sort of,
02:10:37.84 --> 02:10:41.60 allow us to go into these places, because, you know, imagine the lawyers back home,
02:10:41.60 --> 02:10:44.56 and I'm like, well, this is, this is too sketchy, we're not sure about this.
02:10:44.56 --> 02:10:47.28 Plus people with brains back home, they're broke.
02:10:49.36 --> 02:10:54.16 But, you know, I think a lot of it was down to the fact that we'd found this guy who,
02:10:54.16 --> 02:10:58.72 he wasn't a cowboy, he was like, you know, I live, I've lived in these, in, on this, on, in these
02:10:58.72 --> 02:11:02.88 neighborhoods, all my life and sort of the camera come, crew come through or not. So they kept, yeah,
02:11:02.88 --> 02:11:07.28 they came through, they did. So all that footage, and so what's that, what's that show God walk
02:11:07.28 --> 02:11:11.60 walking through? Walking the Americas. Yeah, walking the Americas. How many hours is one of these?
02:11:12.40 --> 02:11:17.20 The series, each one, I mean, the Nile was four episodes, four hours,
02:11:17.20 --> 02:11:20.40 Himalayas was five, I think, walking the Americas as five as well.
02:11:21.68 --> 02:11:27.36 Yeah. Okay, so now you get back from that and you've got to step it up again, right?
02:11:27.36 --> 02:11:30.64 Okay, so the next one. Basically, there's a way you're getting into.
02:11:30.64 --> 02:11:35.36 Going back to my original point of going back to places that I'd studied, my studies at university have
02:11:35.36 --> 02:11:40.96 mainly been about, you know, the Middle East, about places where the old British Empire had
02:11:40.96 --> 02:11:46.48 a legacy, all places in, you know, in the news now, current affairs, and obviously Russia,
02:11:46.48 --> 02:11:52.32 Iran were both pretty high up on the agenda. This was back in 2017, Putin sort of just getting
02:11:52.32 --> 02:11:56.24 reelected all the sort of stuff. So I wanted to go and explore that region more, the Caucasus,
02:11:56.24 --> 02:12:02.32 as a historical region, as fascinating. So I thought one at Doer Journey from Europe into Asia
02:12:02.32 --> 02:12:07.12 over the Caucasus mountains from Russia into Iran. We called that one, crossing the wild frontier.
02:12:07.12 --> 02:12:11.68 So we started on the Black Sea, finished on the Caspy and Sea, and going through places like
02:12:11.68 --> 02:12:19.20 Chechnya, Dajestan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and then finished in Iran. Getting travel permits to go into
02:12:19.20 --> 02:12:23.28 those places was actually quite tricky, but, you know, we had to apply to it to rush in the
02:12:23.28 --> 02:12:27.68 first thing they asked on your visa application is have you or have you ever served in a foreign
02:12:27.68 --> 02:12:33.76 military? So they dig deep into your background. But thankfully, they let me in the same with
02:12:33.76 --> 02:12:38.64 Iran. I mean, they're getting into Iran as a trick you want, because initially they would
02:12:38.64 --> 02:12:43.52 like know where we didn't, you know, especially from the UK, when we're not friends right now.
02:12:45.36 --> 02:12:51.36 Eventually through a contacts, I was told that I could meet a person from the Iranian embassy,
02:12:51.36 --> 02:12:55.20 but not at the embassy. It was just very mysterious lady who wouldn't give me her name,
02:12:55.20 --> 02:12:59.92 but Sunglass is met me in a cafe in South Kensington and London and said, what do you want?
02:12:59.92 --> 02:13:05.52 I said, there's a link to all my shows, go and see for yourself. I gave her a copy of my books,
02:13:06.48 --> 02:13:12.48 and she said, okay, I'll go and read them. And the next day, it was on the present, you know,
02:13:12.48 --> 02:13:18.08 the present sort of promise is desk of Iran and I got approved of visa. And I think what they liked
02:13:18.08 --> 02:13:22.72 is the fact that I'm not there to do on the propaganda, but I'm not showing away from the hard
02:13:22.72 --> 02:13:27.92 story's either, but I'm certainly not there to do investigative journalism to within a gender-based
02:13:27.92 --> 02:13:32.96 sort of approach. I'm there to show what life is like for normal people and they let me in.
02:13:32.96 --> 02:13:40.16 And so I did this amazing trip through places that you just don't get a fair understanding of,
02:13:40.16 --> 02:13:46.000 especially place like Chechnya. And that was a really, really fascinating journey. Thankfully,
02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.84 nothing went particularly wrong with that one. I just got a really great understanding of what
02:13:49.84 --> 02:13:55.20 the region was like. Yeah, and I think a lot. You know, a lot of times when people asked me
02:13:55.20 --> 02:14:00.32 and I was just asked this, I was getting interviewed the other day. And you know, people started asking
02:14:00.32 --> 02:14:06.40 about, well, the war in Iraq should we have been there and all this? Was it, is it the moral right
02:14:06.40 --> 02:14:12.16 thing to do? And a lot of times what I try and do in those situations is I try and bring things
02:14:12.16 --> 02:14:15.92 down to a very granular level of what it was like on the ground and what I like about
02:14:15.92 --> 02:14:23.12 what you're doing is you're going beat. I guess the word is beneath the politics. I don't know if
02:14:23.12 --> 02:14:30.24 that's going to sound right, but you're going beneath the political atmosphere to the actual
02:14:30.24 --> 02:14:35.44 other human beings that are living their lives, that are, you know, trying to earn a living,
02:14:35.44 --> 02:14:40.48 trying to raise their family, trying to build their future. And there's so much commonality that
02:14:40.48 --> 02:14:45.92 gets missed. And that's often what I also say about Iraq, you know, it's like I would kick in the door
02:14:45.92 --> 02:14:51.44 to a building and there'd be, you know, a family in there and they, that's trying to build a business
02:14:51.44 --> 02:14:57.84 of selling whatever dates and the moms, you know, trying to so stuff that she can sell in the neighborhood
02:14:57.84 --> 02:15:02.96 and the kids are wanting to play soccer and they're just normal people. And yet you can never
02:15:03.60 --> 02:15:08.96 you can never see that when it's all screened out by the political viewpoint. So what, what's
02:15:08.96 --> 02:15:14.32 this clicking from me now and I'm starting to understand is that you're going beneath that level
02:15:15.04 --> 02:15:21.52 and talking to the people on the ground and getting a real look and probably I'm assuming exposing
02:15:21.52 --> 02:15:26.24 all these commonalities that we have as human beings with other human beings.
02:15:26.96 --> 02:15:32.40 Yeah, and I mean, that was never an outright intention. It's just sort of happened throughout
02:15:32.40 --> 02:15:39.12 these journeys. Is, is trying to find out what does unite as an actually trying to find those human
02:15:39.12 --> 02:15:43.92 stories and then actually there's a lot of positivity and what I found is the sense of hospitality
02:15:44.64 --> 02:15:49.60 you know, has been overwhelming throughout and that I've seen that in some of the places that you
02:15:49.60 --> 02:15:54.64 wouldn't expect it. Yeah, and even even, you know, I start off joking in the early part of this,
02:15:54.64 --> 02:15:58.24 you know, I'll know and whoever invite me in their house and then as I'm sitting in a listening
02:15:58.24 --> 02:16:01.76 view talk and I've been to, I mean, obviously I've been all over the world and been to all kinds
02:16:01.76 --> 02:16:06.32 of different countries and it's the same thing when you actually when you actually get past that
02:16:06.32 --> 02:16:12.56 get but underneath that political vision that we have of a place, you know, I've had people
02:16:12.56 --> 02:16:19.20 treat me unbelievably well all over the world and that's why you have to get, you have to,
02:16:19.20 --> 02:16:23.76 you have to make those human connections with other people and you'll realize, oh yeah,
02:16:23.76 --> 02:16:29.52 they'll help you out. I mean, like you said, most people, they'll give you some water if you
02:16:29.52 --> 02:16:33.84 need some water, they'll pull over the side of the road and help you if you need it. That's absolutely.
02:16:33.84 --> 02:16:40.72 So that's that's a very enlightening. I'll never forget when I was on the Nile, this was back in 2014,
02:16:40.72 --> 02:16:46.96 I was in Sudan and it was, this was a bit with, there's no crew there, it was me with with a local
02:16:46.96 --> 02:16:51.28 guy called Moas and it was getting very hot. We couldn't carry enough water just to survive.
02:16:51.28 --> 02:16:56.24 So we had to go and buy some camels from the local market. Now I don't know how to keep a camel,
02:16:56.24 --> 02:17:00.56 you know, keep a camel going. So we thought we'd better employ a couple of bedwinne camel handlers
02:17:00.56 --> 02:17:05.36 to come with us. So for two months we tracked across the entire Sahara following the river Nile.
02:17:05.36 --> 02:17:10.24 There was one bed of the Nile where we had to go sort of slightly into the desert because there was
02:17:10.24 --> 02:17:15.84 some security issues by the Nile. So we were going through these villages and everyone was so hospital
02:17:15.84 --> 02:17:21.76 people with saying come in, have some of our water and it was almost, it was so overwhelming.
02:17:21.76 --> 02:17:26.88 We were getting slowed down because we needed to reach the Egyptian border before Ramadan because
02:17:26.88 --> 02:17:31.84 that was the basis for which these two camel handles. So we'll come with you but only for 50 days
02:17:31.84 --> 02:17:35.36 because we're going to get back to our families. So that was the deadline. That was the hard stop.
02:17:36.72 --> 02:17:42.48 So off we went and we were getting further and further behind schedule because of the hospitality
02:17:42.48 --> 02:17:47.84 because people say, I'm going to teach my kids English and this is not the other. So my two
02:17:47.84 --> 02:17:53.28 camel handlers were on the verge of revolt at this stage. So we're going to go home if you're going
02:17:53.28 --> 02:17:58.72 to mess around doing your city filming in this time. So we came to an agreement and said okay what
02:17:58.72 --> 02:18:02.64 would do is day on day off. One day we'll go through the villages where we'll meet people and talk
02:18:02.64 --> 02:18:07.36 and film and just you know, all that and then we'll do another day walking in the desert,
02:18:07.36 --> 02:18:11.28 avoiding the villages and camping out in the desert and there but we can come and walk around.
02:18:11.28 --> 02:18:16.32 But there was one occasion where we'd done this within the middle of the desert.
02:18:16.32 --> 02:18:20.80 But a mile away from the nearest village we set up our camp made a little fire and the local
02:18:20.80 --> 02:18:25.52 villages are mile away. Must have seen the flickering of the flames in the desert and wasn't long
02:18:25.52 --> 02:18:31.68 before a crowd of men came out to investigate the support of you doing. And we said, well we explained
02:18:31.68 --> 02:18:35.60 that we were trying to avoid their hospitality. The most polite terms possible and they said they
02:18:35.60 --> 02:18:40.72 were getting really upset by this. So I know you must come and we said no one guy stormed off.
02:18:40.72 --> 02:18:44.96 And he came back half an hour later. He carried a bed on his head and he said if you're not
02:18:44.96 --> 02:18:50.16 going to come into my house, my home is coming to you. And that I think really demonstrates the
02:18:50.16 --> 02:18:54.16 incredible hospitality. I can't remember. I can't ever imagine that happening back in London if
02:18:54.16 --> 02:18:59.28 a student he's my sort of fussy gun on the street. But it's moments like that that really do
02:18:59.28 --> 02:19:06.72 kind of restore your faith in humankind. But you still have to step it up a little bit. It seems
02:19:06.72 --> 02:19:13.68 like we're just getting more and more hostile environments. And so now it's like 2017, 2018,
02:19:14.48 --> 02:19:22.08 the freaking war and Iraq and Syria with ISIS is just flaring up. So of course you're like a
02:19:22.08 --> 02:19:28.64 moth drawn to the fire. So that's the next one, right? So I'd always been fascinated by the mid
02:19:28.64 --> 02:19:35.76 least. Like I mentioned before I in 2003 I was in Iraq. I like the way you kick these stories off
02:19:35.76 --> 02:19:41.20 with like I've always been fascinated with you know how sharp a shark's teeth could be.
02:19:42.96 --> 02:19:46.64 All right so you got this fascination with the Middle East. So I've been there in 2003 which is
02:19:46.64 --> 02:19:53.28 when I hitchhiked through Baghdad and all this you know. So I'd wanted to return to Iraq and wanted
02:19:53.28 --> 02:19:58.80 to see more of the region ever since and I actually in fact after the Nile I pitched the idea of
02:19:58.80 --> 02:20:05.44 doing a trip around the Arabian Peninsula to the powers that be within TV. And sadly they said no
02:20:05.44 --> 02:20:11.36 they said one it's probably too dangerous and two they didn't feel as though there was sufficient
02:20:11.36 --> 02:20:16.08 interest they said. In fact the word the exact words were that's just the realm of current
02:20:16.08 --> 02:20:20.000 fers and news. Nobody's interested in the Middle East as a destination. It was a place to
02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:24.56 to find out more about. And I thought that was just a disappointing answer. So you're on I'd
02:20:24.56 --> 02:20:28.48 pitched this you know after the Himalayas I pitched it again they said no it's to the Americas
02:20:28.48 --> 02:20:33.52 after that I pitched it again they said no again. And that just wound me up. So after the Russia to
02:20:33.52 --> 02:20:39.12 run expedition I was like I am doing the Middle East I want to go to Arabia come want me with or
02:20:39.12 --> 02:20:45.20 you. So I've pretty much you know got told no we're not doing it by by the TV company by the TV
02:20:45.20 --> 02:20:51.28 guys and then I said well I'm doing it which didn't get out well in TV land in the UK but I decided
02:20:51.28 --> 02:20:57.36 that was that problem. So I set up my introduction company to facilitate this. When you say TV people
02:20:57.36 --> 02:21:02.80 these are the channel. This is the channel. This is the channel. And your pitching is it multiple
02:21:02.80 --> 02:21:06.72 channels that your pitching to is. No this is just like straight up one of the top. It wasn't the
02:21:06.72 --> 02:21:13.36 museum it was it was it was channel 4. They but you know it then got syndicates now to discover
02:21:13.36 --> 02:21:18.64 channel and whoever wants to buy it internationally. So you're pitching to the people that have
02:21:18.64 --> 02:21:24.16 made your other shows. Hey let me do this one and they're like look no not happening and you
02:21:24.16 --> 02:21:30.40 just say all right cool I'm doing it anyways. Yeah so I went to I got sacked but I kind of they said
02:21:30.40 --> 02:21:33.68 okay well you're not working with us if that's the case so I said okay that's fine I'm going to
02:21:33.68 --> 02:21:39.28 go do it. So I set up my introduction company and basically self finance this expedition with a
02:21:39.28 --> 02:21:44.000 couple of mates my friend Dave and Simon who chipped in and going back to that thing about
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:47.84 empowering people and bringing people on the team I said look if we all chip in the same amount of
02:21:47.84 --> 02:21:52.08 cash we'll take up the same amount of profit at the end of the day and they said okay and these
02:21:52.08 --> 02:21:56.96 guys who'd help me before on shows doing the health and safety and I got Neil my got my mate
02:21:56.96 --> 02:22:01.36 who's the director to come on board so we basically just club together and off we went and actually
02:22:01.36 --> 02:22:07.36 it freed up so many things because I was getting more and more frustrated with more and more
02:22:07.36 --> 02:22:13.84 restrictions and limitations on how things were produced and and actually I felt like my creative
02:22:13.84 --> 02:22:18.16 sort of my personal creative spirit was being somewhat suppressed a little bit so I said okay I'm
02:22:18.16 --> 02:22:23.76 going to give this a go what's the worst that can happen so we decided to go and just do this and
02:22:23.76 --> 02:22:29.92 the idea was to go and look at the Arabian Peninsula and all the countries that make that up
02:22:31.76 --> 02:22:36.000 in the same way not necessarily walking the whole route this time because there's a lot of
02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:40.64 empty empty stretch of desert where not much goes on but but certainly hitchhiking and traveling
02:22:40.64 --> 02:22:46.08 with locals so the plan was to start up on the Turkish border with with Syria up in
02:22:46.08 --> 02:22:52.08 Rajava and the Kurdish region and basically walk travel hitchhike whatever all the way around the
02:22:52.08 --> 02:22:57.44 entire Gulf and then finish up at Lebanon in the in the historic city of Biblos which is the
02:22:57.44 --> 02:23:03.68 oldest city in the world and revisit some of these places I've been to my earlier travels including
02:23:03.68 --> 02:23:08.72 Baghdad and to create a Mosul now of course this was in the height of the war against ISIS they
02:23:08.72 --> 02:23:15.44 still weren't defeated in Syria in Iraq so it was a pretty big challenge but doing it very
02:23:15.44 --> 02:23:19.44 light footprint it was only there was only ever three others traveling at once we it meant
02:23:19.44 --> 02:23:22.72 that we could actually go and achieve something that had never been done before which is actually
02:23:22.72 --> 02:23:28.08 travel through all these multiple countries so going through places like Syria we're embedded
02:23:28.08 --> 02:23:36.48 with the the Kurdish militia in Iraq we managed to join a group called the Hashtad the PMF
02:23:36.48 --> 02:23:41.12 the popular mobilisation forces who are sometimes the bad guys but these are the guys fighting
02:23:41.12 --> 02:23:47.76 against ISIS on this occasion but they're also Iranian backed militias I was embedded with them
02:23:47.76 --> 02:23:53.92 on the final awejya offensive which is the final battle against ISIS in Iraq on the front line
02:23:53.92 --> 02:23:59.28 I mean that was that was something else I mean it was it was an entire Afghan tour in three days
02:23:59.28 --> 02:24:05.68 I mean it was it was intense but now you guys are now you guys are the camera crew
02:24:05.68 --> 02:24:09.60 all the just the three of us yeah so now you got cameras rolling all the time and I watched
02:24:09.60 --> 02:24:14.40 some of your some of this stuff that's on YouTube I watch you rolling up to that offensive
02:24:14.40 --> 02:24:19.60 and the guys like all right lunch break and there's some you know having work with the Iraqi soldiers
02:24:19.60 --> 02:24:26.24 of bombs I was like I know what's going on there I know what that feels like yeah um but but
02:24:26.72 --> 02:24:30.32 like what was what was the proximity to the fighting that were you getting right in it?
02:24:30.32 --> 02:24:35.76 I know it was a it was kind of bizarre experience because we managed to hitch a life to the front line
02:24:35.76 --> 02:24:40.88 where these sort of that you know the the Iraqi volunteers these weren't the Iraqi army these
02:24:40.88 --> 02:24:45.28 were literally the guys too old or too young to join the join the military and they were fighting
02:24:45.28 --> 02:24:48.32 on their home turf they were fighting their neighbors so these were mainly sheer
02:24:49.04 --> 02:24:52.96 militia and fighters who volunteered mainly to come out of retirement to basically
02:24:52.96 --> 02:24:58.80 going you know kick ISIS off the of the land so we were rolling up not I mean they had about
02:24:58.80 --> 02:25:04.000 12 main battle tanks but mostly these guys were in flip flops and Toyota pickups you know
02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:08.80 with it with a 50 km on the on the back and driving in a straight line no-tath no-tactic
02:25:08.80 --> 02:25:14.72 no strategy literally taxi to the front line so we got a taxi to the front line said drop us off here
02:25:14.72 --> 02:25:20.40 hitched ride on a tank just jumped on a tank and just drove the main the point vehicle was a bulldozer
02:25:20.40 --> 02:25:27.44 with this Iraqi dude with a cowboy hat absolutely crazy yes smoking a cigar as the bullets were
02:25:27.44 --> 02:25:31.12 pinging off the front of this bulldozer and it was just a straight line waiting to get ambushed and
02:25:31.12 --> 02:25:35.20 we got ambushed and you know you could see the black flags of ISIS in these villages and we just
02:25:35.20 --> 02:25:40.80 drive up to and spread out bond the shit out of it and then go in there and we were in the mix you
02:25:40.80 --> 02:25:46.08 know right on the front line filming everything and liberating these villages and capturing
02:25:46.08 --> 02:25:50.80 ISIS we caught three ISIS commanders and I've still got a f*** so we're on the flags at home actually
02:25:50.80 --> 02:25:57.20 that took with me but it was it was quite it it felt very important to an historical moment you
02:25:57.20 --> 02:26:01.12 know these when the villagers were liberating they caught the like the commander the ISIS
02:26:01.12 --> 02:26:06.40 fighters the women would come out they'd rip their burgers off and they were thanking these Iraqi
02:26:06.40 --> 02:26:11.04 volunteers for for rescue and some of these women hadn't been outside of their own compound for three
02:26:11.04 --> 02:26:18.32 years so it was it was a very powerful thing to it to be witnessed too yeah we had another guest on
02:26:18.32 --> 02:26:25.12 and covered another book on here Holly who's book only cry for the living and she
02:26:25.12 --> 02:26:31.76 interviewed a lot of those women and what they went through so you know liberation was the
02:26:32.80 --> 02:26:37.92 the understatement of the year for what was happening to the people inside those villages that were
02:26:38.48 --> 02:26:47.20 you know and cities that were run by ISIS did you what you you're not I know that you're you
02:26:47.20 --> 02:26:53.36 don't carry a weapon when you do this stuff you just wearing body armor we managed to pick up some
02:26:53.36 --> 02:27:00.56 body armor from a bill you know to bought something local shop and not off you go but yeah going through
02:27:01.68 --> 02:27:06.56 this sort of the urban fighting in place that shark out I mean we were emotional this is a week or two
02:27:06.56 --> 02:27:11.36 after it had been liberated for ISIS I mean there was there was still a lot of clear operations going on
02:27:12.80 --> 02:27:16.56 you've obviously got to be careful but you know I've been doing this for long enough to know what
02:27:16.56 --> 02:27:20.16 to do and what not to do but at the same time we wanted to we wanted to see what was going on
02:27:20.16 --> 02:27:23.04 because nobody was filming this you know the any news reports that were coming out were coming out
02:27:23.04 --> 02:27:27.04 from Baghdad or a bill that's very few people were getting onto the front line and actually seeing
02:27:27.04 --> 02:27:32.72 what life is like for on both sides you know and we we met these ISIS fighters we got a camera in the face
02:27:32.72 --> 02:27:38.40 and that that was quite rare so it was it was fascinating to to see what was going on and to see
02:27:38.40 --> 02:27:42.80 the reality of life and and these guys the the volunteers who were fighting they've been fighting
02:27:42.80 --> 02:27:46.96 solidly for three years so you mentioned that the lunch break coming literally in the middle of the battle
02:27:46.96 --> 02:27:52.16 that the truck turned up with with the chicken sandwiches on on the back and and people just
02:27:52.16 --> 02:27:57.28 stopped there like well the fight's not going anywhere everyone just sat down and and had the chicken
02:27:57.28 --> 02:28:01.20 sandwich and then carried on and it was it was a kind of bizarre experience but it was no different
02:28:01.20 --> 02:28:04.48 to be on exercise in social reclaiming with it with the British Army really.
02:28:08.48 --> 02:28:14.16 As you as you wrap up getting well like how how did you how did you decide it's time to move on
02:28:14.16 --> 02:28:19.12 was it when was it like my zool is now pretty much done was it what what made you decide all right
02:28:19.12 --> 02:28:24.80 we can we can move on now. So on the last day I mean we've been attached with these guys we'd
02:28:24.80 --> 02:28:29.92 seen Mosul we've been attached to the to the to the to the front line fighting units for a couple of days
02:28:30.64 --> 02:28:35.68 there was one guy I mean it kind of it all sunk in I mean one we'd we'd kind of got enough fighting
02:28:35.68 --> 02:28:40.16 footage and we didn't want this show to be entirely about the fighting but but two I meant this one guy
02:28:40.16 --> 02:28:46.64 we've been told we must meet him his name was Abutasine now Abutasine his nickname was the Hawkeye he was
02:28:46.64 --> 02:28:53.68 a rax most feared sniper he'd been fighting he was 65 years old he'd fought in every war since
02:28:53.68 --> 02:29:00.48 1973 against the Israelis he'd fought in Bosnia and chicken year he'd fought in 91 and in the golf
02:29:00.48 --> 02:29:06.48 against you know the Americans he'd fought in 2003 against the British and Badgeroh he'd fought in 2007
02:29:06.48 --> 02:29:14.56 against you probably in in in Iraq in fulludioro and any come out of retirement to fight against
02:29:14.56 --> 02:29:20.88 ISIS. So yeah she had guy. He's a she had guy. Yeah and he was literally a rax most feared warrior I mean
02:29:20.88 --> 02:29:26.24 they'd been a booktrick about him and he was there fighting on his most bike with his big you know
02:29:26.24 --> 02:29:32.88 six foot sniper rifle and he agreed to speak to me he didn't normally do journalists interviews
02:29:32.88 --> 02:29:38.32 particularly not with with with Brits that's for sure but he agreed to speak to me sort of soldiers
02:29:38.32 --> 02:29:42.08 soldier when I sort of told him I was in the in the Paris and he said well I've you know
02:29:42.08 --> 02:29:46.16 probably killed some of your friends as long as you don't mind that and it was a big decision to
02:29:46.16 --> 02:29:51.84 have gone sit with this guy who had been my person and then be but and then be against my colleagues
02:29:51.84 --> 02:29:58.32 and friends but you kind of have to take that emotion out of it and it ultimately was in his
02:29:58.32 --> 02:30:03.84 country listening to his story and by the way now he was fighting against an enemy of
02:30:03.84 --> 02:30:09.36 often and yeah so he was British over on the American extent of and of humanity sure
02:30:10.24 --> 02:30:13.92 so we were centered around the campfire and he's a whole bit of story killed 400 odd people
02:30:15.84 --> 02:30:20.56 he was quite open about the fact that he was against you know others the coalition
02:30:20.56 --> 02:30:24.80 invading his country but we were on the right side of history this time around and he
02:30:24.80 --> 02:30:29.76 thought that what he was doing with the right thing which was to to rid his land of ISIS which
02:30:29.76 --> 02:30:37.44 he was convinced was a creation of the chaos of you know ten years of war and I think it was that moment
02:30:37.44 --> 02:30:41.52 I thought okay enough enough I've heard I've heard the story we should move on and it was probably
02:30:41.52 --> 02:30:47.36 about time actually because sadly seven days later he was himself killed by ISIS on that same battle
02:30:47.36 --> 02:30:54.80 on the last day of the war against ISIS so some sort of poetry in that but we left that behind
02:30:54.80 --> 02:31:00.08 and carried on the journey and continued around the Gulf and and like I said I didn't want
02:31:00.08 --> 02:31:04.48 this journey to be just about the conflict because that's what we associate so much with with the region
02:31:05.68 --> 02:31:10.24 but to then jump out of Iraq and then be in southern Iraq actually we were in the in amongst the
02:31:10.24 --> 02:31:15.20 the marshes around Nazarene Badrera you know this is the birthplace of civilisation god and
02:31:15.20 --> 02:31:21.04 of Eden and so on and to be in amongst the marsh Arabs I don't know if you served down there with
02:31:21.04 --> 02:31:29.28 these these these are very traditional tribes who literally you know live amongst the marshes in
02:31:29.28 --> 02:31:36.80 these in these ancient ways of living in the hot and called Mudhif and you know fishing and
02:31:36.80 --> 02:31:41.28 and farming buffalo I mean it's like going back to biblical times and it was that start contrast
02:31:41.28 --> 02:31:46.08 you know which was for me really really interesting and I wanted to give that balance and then
02:31:46.08 --> 02:31:52.16 to go from there into QA to then to do buy where you suddenly got these skyscrapers and
02:31:52.96 --> 02:31:58.48 Friday boozy brunches I wanted to show that whole spectrum of what life is like in in this region
02:31:58.48 --> 02:32:02.88 and it was some sort of really start contrast and to get your head into that and around that was
02:32:02.88 --> 02:32:07.92 was often quite difficult. I mean Dubai is just crazy it's crazy yeah like especially when you
02:32:07.92 --> 02:32:13.52 talk about that contrast between Mosul completely destroyed and you know just a living hell for
02:32:13.52 --> 02:32:20.16 everyone that's up there then you go to Dubai which is just I mean it's sort of a tomorrow yeah
02:32:20.16 --> 02:32:24.96 the entire city has been built for like 20 years or something like that and just everything is
02:32:26.40 --> 02:32:32.48 brand new and to the the highest standards of luxury in everything it's like
02:32:32.48 --> 02:32:37.04 you can't get more of a start contrast. It was a huge amount I mean I actually quite enjoyed
02:32:37.04 --> 02:32:41.52 going and it was a nice break having been in on this war zone for the first time. Yeah you probably
02:32:41.52 --> 02:32:47.68 got confused but you start like a bed. But that's what I wanted to show you I wanted to show
02:32:47.68 --> 02:32:52.96 these really start differences and this traditional way of life the beduined you know I studied
02:32:52.96 --> 02:32:57.04 all about Lawrence Arabia and the old sort of arabist explorers people like Wolf with
02:32:57.04 --> 02:33:02.40 Essageau who crossed the empty quarter and so to then go from there into a man which is a
02:33:02.40 --> 02:33:08.08 beautiful country you've got these amazing endless and dunes and very traditional way of life
02:33:08.08 --> 02:33:14.000 there and then it's Yemen again a country that was incredibly difficult to get into but we somehow
02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:22.40 managed it. It was yeah showed a fair representation. You get done with this trip and then you go
02:33:22.40 --> 02:33:25.92 back so how long is it take when you get done with the trip how long is it take for the production
02:33:25.92 --> 02:33:29.84 to have happened and then what did you do in this particular case did you now have to sell
02:33:29.84 --> 02:33:35.12 what you made? Well exactly yeah so with this one you know I got my own team on the case so we were
02:33:35.12 --> 02:33:39.36 editing on the go I mean we're kind of sending the rushes back and then we got an edit you know
02:33:39.36 --> 02:33:42.64 got an edit suite and we were doing it on the go so I think it ended up being
02:33:43.36 --> 02:33:48.96 then we got back from the trip in February March and it was on TV sort of two or three months later.
02:33:48.96 --> 02:33:54.08 Who did you go back to channel for them? They wouldn't take it. They were principal
02:33:54.08 --> 02:33:58.32 and they said principal little bit of the top to you but we sold it to discover a channel in the UK
02:33:58.32 --> 02:34:05.12 and then they're like what? And then it got shortlisted for a broadcast award so yeah that was
02:34:05.12 --> 02:34:11.84 that was a real sense of not just vindication but you know it was it was a very very good documentary
02:34:11.84 --> 02:34:17.60 and for me it took it back to the the organic authentic roots of what my journey's ultimately
02:34:17.60 --> 02:34:24.000 all and is that one also like four or five hours four or five shows yeah that one's five episodes as well.
02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:29.68 Were you profitable did you make money? It was just face just about didn't make that much money on it
02:34:29.68 --> 02:34:38.48 but it was worth it just because it set the ball very very high. So you get done with that one
02:34:38.48 --> 02:34:44.48 what how do you measure success on those in terms of I mean is it view like hey a YouTube video
02:34:44.48 --> 02:34:51.20 gets whatever a million views how are you judging success or if it's hitting the people right
02:34:51.20 --> 02:34:55.36 or is it just feedback from people telling you hey that was outstanding I never understood
02:34:55.36 --> 02:35:01.12 the Middle East like that now I do thank you is it how are you getting your your gratification?
02:35:01.12 --> 02:35:06.16 So for me the validation it's not just about ratings because obviously that's a lot to do with
02:35:06.16 --> 02:35:11.28 the the media landscape and the current politics of what's going on it's changed enormously just
02:35:11.28 --> 02:35:16.96 in the seven or eight years that I've been doing this you know in terms of TV what is you know
02:35:16.96 --> 02:35:22.32 it's changed enormously with the amount of streaming platforms out there the sheer you know
02:35:23.20 --> 02:35:27.28 just difference in demographics so people aren't watching TV live anymore they're watching on
02:35:27.28 --> 02:35:32.000 their laptop so watching on the mobile so and there's so many new new s-folds out there anyway so it's
02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:36.88 very difficult to sort of gauge in terms of ratings a lot of the stream pluffles don't even publish
02:35:36.88 --> 02:35:42.80 there viewing figures so I don't think for and that for me was never really as important as just
02:35:42.80 --> 02:35:50.40 doing what felt authentic and true to my own belief really and if there's a bit of feedback
02:35:50.40 --> 02:35:54.64 that's good and positive then great I mean you know of course when you go to controversial
02:35:54.64 --> 02:35:59.04 place you're going to get a bit of flack from different groups you know you didn't show my
02:35:59.04 --> 02:36:03.52 tribe and what we do or especially if you go to like the whole Israel Palestine question or if
02:36:03.52 --> 02:36:08.08 you're traveling in somewhere like Iran you know it's difficult it's difficult to tell everyone
02:36:08.08 --> 02:36:13.44 story you never gonna succeed in that but for me it was actually the slightly
02:36:14.88 --> 02:36:20.88 indirect feedback when when you get the head of a charity saying thank you you know we've been
02:36:20.88 --> 02:36:26.08 trying to put our country on the map for the last 20 years and just one of your episodes is
02:36:26.08 --> 02:36:31.04 double that revenue or something like that or you get individuals who call you and say you
02:36:31.04 --> 02:36:37.44 inspire me to quit my job in finance and you know go build a clinic in Nepal whatever it might
02:36:37.44 --> 02:36:43.68 be and as a result you know I've personally been asked to be an ambassador for probably hundreds
02:36:43.68 --> 02:36:47.76 of charities I'm currently ambassador for about 20 or so charities and it's things like that
02:36:47.76 --> 02:36:51.28 that make it all worthwhile for me so I'm not really that bother about the ratings obviously it's nice
02:36:51.28 --> 02:36:57.04 to get good feedback and it's nice to keep getting asked to do these journeys but it's hard now
02:36:57.04 --> 02:37:02.40 to do bigger and better when I feel as I've kind of done most of the journeys that I've
02:37:02.40 --> 02:37:07.52 really wanted to so I'm just trying to think about how do I diversify or stay true to my
02:37:08.08 --> 02:37:15.52 true to my sort of core beliefs but also to enjoy what I'm doing so I'm fun and yeah
02:37:16.32 --> 02:37:23.20 try and find something that's appropriate and useful. Did the so the next one was walking
02:37:23.20 --> 02:37:27.92 with the elephant says that right sure that coming after that came after yep so eventually they came
02:37:27.92 --> 02:37:32.56 back they came back with us sort of saying oh can you make another one for us so you kind of won
02:37:32.56 --> 02:37:37.44 strategic so I went in the end I guess in that way so yeah they came back and said we want to
02:37:37.44 --> 02:37:43.36 we want to do some eels and I've always been fascinated by conservation once again there he goes again
02:37:43.36 --> 02:37:46.56 he said that always been fascinated by conservation so I was wondering
02:37:46.56 --> 02:37:54.40 elephant's always been my thing when I was 10 years old I sort of I don't I've been begging
02:37:54.40 --> 02:37:58.08 my parents to take me to Kenya to go and see elephants and they couldn't afford it because
02:37:58.08 --> 02:38:01.84 they were teachers but eventually they did when I was I think I was 14 and it was my
02:38:01.84 --> 02:38:08.56 but I'm you know seeing Africa big skies the Savannah the wildlife so I had always wanted
02:38:08.56 --> 02:38:13.28 to try and incorporate a sort of an element of giving back in all my expressions so I always
02:38:13.28 --> 02:38:18.88 paired with the charity or or raising a shawl I'm a high net worth of which got a high high profile
02:38:18.88 --> 02:38:24.72 supporter for unicef so I do I do a bit of work with sort of children's charities along the way
02:38:26.48 --> 02:38:31.44 but conservation is it is something that I think is really important not just for the sake of
02:38:31.44 --> 02:38:38.88 animals but but habitats keeping wilderness areas wild and so I thought by going back to Africa
02:38:38.88 --> 02:38:45.44 particularly Botswana in this case and there's a real opportunity here to showcase what's happening
02:38:45.44 --> 02:38:51.12 in the natural world and by doing one of my sort of walks through a country but this time following
02:38:51.12 --> 02:38:56.56 her her developments on the ancient migration route there's a new way of telling this story
02:38:56.56 --> 02:39:01.36 so I was walking with her developments for 650 miles across Botswana all the way to the
02:39:01.36 --> 02:39:06.88 Occupang Hotel to how many often well there's 120,000 in Botswana how many were you are
02:39:06.88 --> 02:39:11.44 in the park and with them I mean it just dependent on the day really but we're getting pretty close to
02:39:11.44 --> 02:39:16.80 so pretty big groups like 10 or like 100 no it could be 30 50 yeah it's probably 50 was the
02:39:16.80 --> 02:39:20.40 maximum we saw it anyone did you get to my awesome of them you get to know some of the
02:39:20.40 --> 02:39:23.92 personalities yeah especially when they're flopping their ears and chasing after you
02:39:25.92 --> 02:39:32.72 but I mean it was a really really intense experience because you're when you're in an alien environment
02:39:32.72 --> 02:39:37.84 on the one hand that you're on your your on your guard the whole time you've got to watch out
02:39:37.84 --> 02:39:41.60 because at any time not just from the elephants but you know a snake like when you're
02:39:41.60 --> 02:39:44.88 when you're sort of out taking a dump as a snake might go and bite on the ass or whatever in my
02:39:44.88 --> 02:39:50.000 be you've got to be really careful we were camping the whole time staying inside the national parks
02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:54.40 we've got a very we we were sort of greeted with them by the Botswana government with with
02:39:54.40 --> 02:39:58.56 the outlustrous back because they said look you know not only encouraging tourism showcasing the
02:39:58.56 --> 02:40:05.12 Botswana such a tourism conservation success actually and and so we were able to camp inside
02:40:05.12 --> 02:40:11.68 these national parks and and really gets to know the wildlife but I'd say that as human beings coming
02:40:11.68 --> 02:40:15.84 from Africa that's what we're designed it we meant to be you know in that natural environment
02:40:15.84 --> 02:40:21.28 so it did feel like a very natural journey as well and that was that was the last big trip
02:40:21.28 --> 02:40:26.000 that you took that brings us up to current date pretty much that was in the summer of 2019
02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:31.92 last year doesn't count because of COVID so yeah that kind of brings us up to date on on this
02:40:31.92 --> 02:40:37.36 sort of big journey is ready so that's probably a pretty good place to stop other than to say so
02:40:37.76 --> 02:40:42.24 what the your latest book that's about to come out is the book that I've been referring back to
02:40:42.24 --> 02:40:46.80 some of but somewhat today the art of exploration so what what what made you decide you had
02:40:46.80 --> 02:40:51.44 need to get another because this is like what do we say was your ninth book this is my this is number
02:40:51.44 --> 02:40:58.000 nine and the last 12 months having been somewhat locked up as give me plenty of opportunity to
02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:04.24 reflect on some of the stories that I didn't put in my other books and I wanted to sort of
02:41:04.24 --> 02:41:09.92 I guess give some of the lessons that I've learned personally but not just that it lessons from
02:41:09.92 --> 02:41:16.08 other explorers from other key leaders and and reflect back on my time in the army as well so it
02:41:16.08 --> 02:41:22.08 really it's a bit of a summing up for me of the last sort of 10-15 years really of the lessons that
02:41:22.08 --> 02:41:27.44 I've learned and I've tried to put them into relevant themes and make them applicable and relevant
02:41:27.44 --> 02:41:31.92 to people in their daily life so it's not just me telling ten of my war stories this is
02:41:31.92 --> 02:41:37.04 some of the stories hopefully will all inspire people to hopefully you know integrate them into
02:41:37.04 --> 02:41:41.68 their own lives yeah I don't think I did a great job of what I selected to read in terms of the fact that
02:41:41.68 --> 02:41:48.16 you're you're you're you're kind of given your philosophy much throughout much of the book and
02:41:48.16 --> 02:41:52.24 you're explaining you know what lesson you learned but you know here's how I learned the lesson
02:41:52.24 --> 02:41:56.72 then you explain well this is what the lesson was and this is how you can apply it so it's a it's a
02:41:56.72 --> 02:42:01.92 it's a philosophical book as well not just like you said a book I read stories I read a lot of
02:42:01.92 --> 02:42:05.68 stories I like to read stories but and you know some of I said here's some of the leadership
02:42:05.68 --> 02:42:10.80 lessons you learned and I pointed out the the way that you lay those out so that people can and you
02:42:10.80 --> 02:42:14.40 it's not just about leadership though it's about decision making you got a whole section and
02:42:14.40 --> 02:42:20.72 they're about how you sort of lay out decision making based on your military education and what
02:42:20.72 --> 02:42:27.60 so there's all kinds of things that you can pull from this book and they're all rooted in what
02:42:27.60 --> 02:42:31.76 you've been through which is again that's where my all my books are just hey this is what I've
02:42:31.76 --> 02:42:37.76 been through and here's what I took away from it so you did this exact same thing and and anybody
02:42:37.76 --> 02:42:44.64 that's listening you're gonna you're gonna pull a lot of lessons out of this book I scratch the
02:42:44.64 --> 02:42:52.08 surface I let read less than 5% of this book on the air today so pick up the book it's freaking
02:42:52.08 --> 02:42:57.12 yeah I mean it's just just chalk as you would say in England it's chalk full of lessons learned
02:42:58.48 --> 02:43:05.52 where can people find you I know you got Levison Wood dot com what's Levison it's a family name right
02:43:05.52 --> 02:43:10.24 it's my that was my dad's name and his dad's name like it's just like on the fifth year
02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:15.12 but yeah no people can find out more about it on what I've got an Instagram page
02:43:15.84 --> 02:43:22.24 Levison dot wood I've got Twitter and yeah the new book is coming out in June in the UK
02:43:22.24 --> 02:43:28.000 and hopefully it will be out in the US shortly after yeah we need to get the pre order on Amazon
02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:35.52 yeah by the way yeah like you got about two weeks for today to make that happen to go uh echo
02:43:35.52 --> 02:43:42.48 Charles is any questions from anything else uh remember when you lost your wallet remember
02:43:43.84 --> 02:43:49.20 do you think if you didn't lose your wallet you would not have gone into the military when you think about it
02:43:51.04 --> 02:43:55.60 I think that you know when I lost my wallet the inspiration you know the main lesson that I learnt
02:43:55.60 --> 02:44:01.52 there was kind of told by this young lieutenant who found it was go-in travel and and perhaps if I
02:44:01.52 --> 02:44:05.44 hadn't have traveled if I hadn't have got those expert early experiences if I hadn't have
02:44:05.44 --> 02:44:12.16 had the gun pulled on me by the the guy in the taxi in Zimbabwe then maybe I wouldn't have enough
02:44:12.16 --> 02:44:16.64 stories to get me through the interviews that got me into the army so who knows I mean hindsight
02:44:16.64 --> 02:44:22.16 obviously a great thing but but yeah I think you know take opportunities when when they come
02:44:22.16 --> 02:44:30.08 come along say thank you to people you know you never know be courteous and it's it's you know
02:44:30.08 --> 02:44:34.80 writing back to that guy and just say thank you for handing all it back you know got me
02:44:35.44 --> 02:44:40.48 all those tips in the form of that six page essay so it's just little things like that it's just
02:44:40.48 --> 02:44:45.60 it's never passed by an opportunity and never passed by an opportunity to to be thankful and grateful
02:44:45.60 --> 02:44:50.88 and no matter how bad things get there's always an opportunity in that and so like when I wrote my
02:44:50.88 --> 02:44:54.96 leg and couldn't get in the special forces I now look back and join the dots and think actually
02:44:54.96 --> 02:45:00.32 it was that it was that well I thought was a low point actually was a real opportunity to go
02:45:00.32 --> 02:45:06.72 into something different yeah this crazy huh because on the surface you're like dang I lost my wallet
02:45:06.72 --> 02:45:13.44 because that sucks and I can't you lose your wallet oh man brutal and then yeah man it opens up this
02:45:13.44 --> 02:45:16.88 whole thing and it's like dang I'm kind of glad I did lose my wallet yeah of course at least I'm
02:45:16.88 --> 02:45:21.04 having a bit of faith that in every situation now whenever I'm feeling ah you know down at that
02:45:21.04 --> 02:45:25.76 that's gone really badly I'd remember myself all the times that the bad situations if you just
02:45:25.76 --> 02:45:32.16 view them right and have the right attitude then then you can turn defeat into victory and and I think
02:45:32.16 --> 02:45:35.68 that's what you got to remind yourself so when everything's really badly I try and just convince
02:45:35.68 --> 02:45:39.44 myself even if it's like a delusional that this is a great opportunity
02:45:41.44 --> 02:45:46.64 absolutely true man absolutely true well like I said probably a good place to wrap work
02:45:46.64 --> 02:45:53.12 approaching three hours right now thanks for joining us absolutely and and more important thanks
02:45:53.12 --> 02:46:02.48 for your service thanks your service to great Britain one of our maybe our most maybe our strongest
02:46:02.48 --> 02:46:08.72 ally not only for your service but your your fathers and your grandfather's I know I watched a
02:46:08.72 --> 02:46:15.04 video about your grandfather and it was just awesome that that that he was out there like you holding
02:46:15.04 --> 02:46:22.24 the line against tyranny and evil and thanks for sharing some of your stories I need you
02:46:22.24 --> 02:46:28.08 following me on like I said there's ten books I always try and prepare I couldn't read ten books
02:46:28.08 --> 02:46:34.88 get ready for this thing um to a ton of great stories and and the lessons that you you share
02:46:34.88 --> 02:46:45.68 and the experiences allow all of us to learn through your vicariously through your explorations of
02:46:45.68 --> 02:46:53.04 the world which you've made the best of I don't recommend them but I'm glad you did them and
02:46:53.04 --> 02:46:56.16 I'm glad we can take away those lessons bands awesome awesome to meet you man thanks for
02:46:56.16 --> 02:47:06.24 thank you so much thank you both and with that Levison Wood has left the building he left the building
02:47:06.24 --> 02:47:12.48 he wasn't he didn't have anything with him so he may be going I don't know he's going somewhere
02:47:12.48 --> 02:47:16.000 we don't know where he came in we don't know where he came from we don't know where he's going
02:47:16.64 --> 02:47:24.48 but he is out there all on the continual exploration with a pocket full of like
02:47:24.48 --> 02:47:34.40 you know two paper clips and as wallet that he found and we're good so awesome to have him
02:47:34.40 --> 02:47:40.64 on here for sure we were talking about exploration that's the name of his new book the art of
02:47:40.64 --> 02:47:49.12 exploration echo seems like exploration topic of the day can you recommend some ways we can
02:47:49.12 --> 02:47:58.64 explore getting better as humans for sure what he got so I think keeping ourselves capable
02:47:59.20 --> 02:48:06.40 good call really you know look we have a path the path is hard not all the time but it can be
02:48:06.40 --> 02:48:11.76 hard so I'm saying everyone's not a while we can deviate from that path but the best way to deviate
02:48:11.76 --> 02:48:17.68 from the path is when we explore if we explore as long as it's in the right direction don't slip off
02:48:17.68 --> 02:48:25.68 the path. I'm gonna go backwards keep moving forward anyway so while we're doing that we are improving
02:48:25.68 --> 02:48:30.32 ourselves we are working out there's certain fundamentals to the path we'll say for sure working out
02:48:30.32 --> 02:48:39.28 physical improvement capability strength the more I'd learn about strength and strength training
02:48:39.28 --> 02:48:44.64 or is this in training you know this kind of stuff the more benefits start to reveal themselves
02:48:44.64 --> 02:48:52.56 yep did you know strength training resistance training is the best thing for your cognitive
02:48:52.56 --> 02:48:58.16 capacity as you grow older yes yeah I did did I say that last time you did I remembered it why
02:48:58.16 --> 02:49:05.44 as I was out and for your immune system so you either like I think you hold vitamin D
02:49:05.44 --> 02:49:11.76 more efficiently or yes something with vitamin D where you can check you know anyway so
02:49:11.76 --> 02:49:16.88 stand the path in that way anyway through this path you might need supplementation yes all right
02:49:16.88 --> 02:49:24.08 chocolate supplements only the best kind by the way yeah you probably need unless you are just
02:49:24.08 --> 02:49:31.04 dedicating 24 hours a day for meal prep and you have your spare out shopping you're out harvesting
02:49:31.04 --> 02:49:37.20 your own meat you're out you're out in the garden pulling up carrots you know if that's what you're
02:49:37.20 --> 02:49:42.000 doing you can probably get away without supplementation look we we know that we don't we want to
02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:47.60 eat clean right if you're eating clean you don't need it the chances that are pretty small
02:49:47.60 --> 02:49:54.24 yeah very pretty small and again and there's a bigger picture going on as well and woo
02:49:54.24 --> 02:49:58.88 I have a huge advocate of garden I have a small little mini-chur garden not many things in there
02:49:58.88 --> 02:50:03.76 that's a tomato is in there either way it's not about my garden it's about efficiency
02:50:03.76 --> 02:50:10.56 apparently it is about good what kind of a little couple of rad it was just some tomatoes nonetheless
02:50:12.32 --> 02:50:19.36 you know if you if gardening is your thing then cool but for a lot of us if you dedicate all these hours
02:50:19.36 --> 02:50:25.92 daily weekly whatever meal prep or whatever it might become a little inefficient so supplementation
02:50:26.80 --> 02:50:32.32 might be kind of the jam as far as efficiency goes so good news supplementation for you very good news
02:50:32.32 --> 02:50:39.04 so what we got stuff for your joints stuff for protein stuff for cognitive health stuff for general health
02:50:39.04 --> 02:50:47.20 vitamin D3 joint warfare super cool got some more conditional protein called war
02:50:47.20 --> 02:50:50.88 cold war immunity
02:50:50.88 --> 02:50:59.12 that immunity sure all these things on jockel fuel the same punk milk yeah protein in the form of a
02:50:59.12 --> 02:51:08.72 dessert I authorized the next flavor of milk what is it one it's gonna be that banana cream oh yeah
02:51:08.72 --> 02:51:14.48 yeah no name yet no name yet look and it's hard to take banana cream and turn that into something
02:51:14.48 --> 02:51:20.48 tactical right so if anybody's got some ideas on banana cream like my my years are open yeah
02:51:20.48 --> 02:51:26.24 I'm ready for something cool you know about banana cream that's not what you got that's
02:51:26.24 --> 02:51:32.24 interesting because that's not like an obvious flavor but once you say you're like oh yeah that's
02:51:32.24 --> 02:51:37.12 a legitimate flavor yeah even okay so the pumpkin spice in my opinion this is just my opinion
02:51:37.12 --> 02:51:44.24 because kind of an obvious flavor in obvious flavor yes but and I'm like not that into it fine
02:51:44.24 --> 02:51:48.32 if that's my last flavor one would do not drink it no probably not but
02:51:49.92 --> 02:51:53.92 if when it comes to banana because I don't like pumpkin pie you know how certain people like
02:51:53.92 --> 02:51:59.68 really love pumpkin pie and that's it no but monopo I don't know anybody like that yeah I don't
02:51:59.68 --> 02:52:05.20 couple people really yes but are you sure bro are you exaggerating I think you know someone
02:52:05.20 --> 02:52:09.92 that old beats pumpkin pie it is not for your five you they won't eat keep high put it that's
02:52:09.92 --> 02:52:14.24 where you're at right okay so if I'm not mistaken I exaggerated a little bit but you know what I mean
02:52:14.24 --> 02:52:22.16 it's fine say that because there's not one single person on the planet that only eats just pumpkin
02:52:22.16 --> 02:52:28.16 by one hundred percent when the other prizes yes that yes or a pilgrim's pilgrims eat pumpkin pie that's
02:52:28.16 --> 02:52:35.52 all oh yeah I think they eat apple pie yeah they do anyway so cool the point is banana cream pie
02:52:36.48 --> 02:52:41.12 that is a legitimate one where it's like hey banana cream pie and then there's like everything else
02:52:41.12 --> 02:52:46.16 hmm I'm one of those people but dad's one of those people there you go be seated in a game in the
02:52:46.16 --> 02:52:55.04 game fully so banana cream milk like that's that's that's good no good flavor we also got the
02:52:55.04 --> 02:53:01.60 drinks I'm drinking one right now I check a lot of these drinks this one go in a can you can get it
02:53:02.32 --> 02:53:06.96 you can get it out wall wall if you're on the east coast and for a little while they were
02:53:07.52 --> 02:53:13.28 there was a little break pumping going on because the logistics train look logistics wins wars
02:53:13.28 --> 02:53:17.76 it took me a little bit of time to get that logistics train right now there's a hate can you pump
02:53:17.76 --> 02:53:24.000 the brakes a little bit guess what logistics train is a moving out of the tracks rolling the
02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:28.72 wall wall roll into wall wall clear out the shelves they didn't want me saying that for a little while
02:53:29.52 --> 02:53:33.92 I'm back saying it going to wall wall clear out the shelves also vitamin shop and by the way all this

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:20.16 it's a thing with us that's what I'm saying it's not a thing with anybody else I'm saying
02:54:20.16 --> 02:54:24.32 it actually there's no one else that said you know what oh we want our we want our energy drink
02:54:24.32 --> 02:54:30.08 to be healthy so we are going to go to the end degree and paste your eyes it so we don't have to put
02:54:30.08 --> 02:54:34.56 any chemicals in it yeah that's where we went who else is with us there oh look around you know
02:54:34.56 --> 02:54:39.12 who I see nobody yeah and you know it's not a thing it's a thing for us there's what I'm saying
02:54:39.12 --> 02:54:43.44 it is now so what and you're talking even from like a banking standpoint where it's like yeah
02:54:43.44 --> 02:54:47.76 we're not going to do that we're not going to do it we're just going to obviously good but as a human
02:54:47.76 --> 02:54:54.64 being I don't now I don't have to go hey I need some energy I'm going to pay the price a little bit
02:54:54.64 --> 02:54:59.04 but I need that energy right now say hey let's pay that price you know there's no sacrifice no
02:54:59.04 --> 02:55:03.52 sacrifice well pound it energy drink I don't I don't even need energy right now I just want
02:55:03.52 --> 02:55:07.92 to drink that energy drink and guess what I'm going to be more healthy afterwards
02:55:08.96 --> 02:55:14.32 when it comes down to it I'm going to be more healthy and I got my energy drink you done good
02:55:14.32 --> 02:55:22.56 you made up for your pumpkin pie station also at origin USA you can get American made
02:55:23.60 --> 02:55:29.76 stuff when I say stuff I mean jeans American made denim kind of a big deal it's a real big deal
02:55:29.76 --> 02:55:34.24 because you're probably thinking oh I you know I'm I'm supporting America I got these iconic

03:00:22.72 --> 03:00:28.08 about missing any any designs or anything like that you can subscribe to this podcast there's a
03:00:28.08 --> 03:00:33.60 bunch of different places where it's hosted we also have jockel and ravling which I've been
03:00:33.60 --> 03:00:40.64 recording with Darrell Cooper we're going deep into some crazy subjects unraveling history and
03:00:40.64 --> 03:00:45.52 seen where how we got where we're at we have the grounded podcast we have the warrior kid podcast
03:00:45.52 --> 03:00:53.76 we also the the underground jockel underground dot com we're doing we're recording a little podcast
03:00:53.76 --> 03:00:58.48 there the reason that we're doing that is so that we don't have to have sponsors
03:01:00.32 --> 03:01:05.20 because why because we don't want sponsors because then they dictate what we can and can't do
03:01:05.20 --> 03:01:09.68 which we don't like we also don't want to have the platforms themselves be able to dictate what we can
03:01:09.68 --> 03:01:15.20 and cannot do now look we the platforms been good to us so far everyone's been okay with what we're
03:01:15.20 --> 03:01:20.16 doing that's fine what happens when they're not what happens when they decide they're just going
03:01:20.16 --> 03:01:26.80 to take a sort of injecting advertisements onto our podcast and when I say all I mean everyone
03:01:26.80 --> 03:01:35.76 all of our suit what do we do then we don't have control so we made we made the jockel underground
03:01:35.76 --> 03:01:40.96 podcast jockel underground dot com across a dollars and eighteen cents a month great way to support
03:01:40.96 --> 03:01:45.84 what we're doing if you can't look if you can't afford it we're look we are a podcast of the people
03:01:47.12 --> 03:01:52.000 that's why this podcast is free that's why this podcast doesn't have advertising other than
03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:56.72 what we're doing right now what you could have turned off 48 minutes ago before echo even started talking
03:01:59.28 --> 03:02:03.68 but if you can't afford it that's cool email assistance ad jockel underground dot com
03:02:03.68 --> 03:02:08.48 we'll still hook you up that's what we're here for we have a youtube channel where echo post videos
03:02:08.48 --> 03:02:17.60 and you can subscribe to that one also origin USA has a YouTube channel is that what it's called
03:02:17.60 --> 03:02:22.000 origin USA has a youtube channel yet technically at the end of the day but it's like a series you
03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:29.12 know like you know a youtube channel but it's a super general thing but there's just like a series
03:02:29.12 --> 03:02:34.000 you know that's an origin HD rads a series yeah that's what that's what you're talking about right
03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:41.68 yeah because origin HD is on the youtube channel of origin or in USA yeah well and echo makes a lot of
03:02:41.68 --> 03:02:46.000 those videos and the ones that are really good are usually the ones on the system directorals
03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:52.32 uh psychological warfare yeah to double tracks you know you need jockel to help you
03:02:53.20 --> 03:02:57.44 get past the moment a week this you're like kind of like a therapist in a way or what you call
03:02:57.44 --> 03:03:02.16 like a life coach yeah it's a life coach your life coach because you don't like a coach with a baseball
03:03:02.16 --> 03:03:09.20 bat essentially know the life coach is the the what you call the classic with a stereotypical
03:03:09.20 --> 03:03:14.40 situation is like hey I'm about to I don't you know I just quit smoking and it's like I feel
03:03:14.40 --> 03:03:20.08 like really feel like smoking it's really like you know on my mind to call your life coach and they
03:03:20.08 --> 03:03:26.64 tell you gently like why you shouldn't smoke or give you a turn so far and all this stuff so
03:03:26.64 --> 03:03:30.64 jocquads is on version of that which is called psychological warfare so it's recorded what you
