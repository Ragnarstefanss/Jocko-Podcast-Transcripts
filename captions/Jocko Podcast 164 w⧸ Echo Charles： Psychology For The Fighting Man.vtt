00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is Jocco podcast number 164 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I crept ahead a few feet and raised carefully to look over the bank.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Crack! A rifle was thrust up and fired only inches from Hales head. The bullet split his scalp and the concussion broke as it yeardrums.

4
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Blood streamed over his face blinding him and I helped get him back to Stuart.

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Then I pitched a second bomb, close in. Meanwhile, McIntyre had not halted. He had rushed on and Sambro and I half raised as we hurried after him.

6
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
A machine gun blazed at us from a spot on the right and we dove into the mud. Crash! Slam!

7
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The stoaks gun was at work but it shells dropped short, falling almost in our path.

8
00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We rose again as the maximum stop firing, then a flaming white hot instant, a blivion.

9
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
When I recovered consciousness, my head was splitting with pain and a terrible nausea had seized my stomach.

10
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The stoaks shell had dropped beside me, throwing me bodily into the mud and Sambro was stunned as well.

11
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
He was lying in the slime and feeling his limbs certain that he was wounded.

12
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
All around us was a frightful clamor of guns and bombs and rifle shots.

13
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I heard McIntyre's voice shouting five rounds rapid, then it stopped, but my nose was bleeding and I was too dizzy to stand.

14
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We crawled towards the sound, then halted. There was a great plunging in the murk and two dim figures came toward us puffing and blowing tugging at something.

15
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
They were Germans, big men, and a machine gun and tripod.

16
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
They placed it just in front of us and one man yanked at a long cartridge belt.

17
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I pulled the pin from my last bomb and heaved the missile at a count of two.

18
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It burst just beneath the tripod. One man went down like a huge tree, the other struggled a moment before he stilled.

19
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We went by them, making sure the gun was ruined, and a new made crater found in man of a company with his wrist almost severed.

20
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We bandaged him quickly and sent him back and were rising to go on when Clark came stumbling through the mud and yelled at us.

21
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Come on, give them his shout was cut off. He pitched dead in front of us.

22
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The man scurried by with a stretcher and we went over to the bank where we could see men moving.

23
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
It was Lewis Gunner and he said McIntyre had been shot through the stomach and was dying.

24
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:46.000
They got him on the old stretcher but he went on the to the short bank in front and found old Bill, Mickey and Johnson crouched there shooting in a German gun with that street sparks,

25
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
not more than 30 yards away.

26
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Sambro had bombs with him and he and I hurled them.

27
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The burst seems right on the gun and it was silenced.

28
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I stared at the other man on the bank.

29
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They were all dead.

30
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Melville and Ira and Jennings lying there together rifle in hand all shot through the head by one sweep of the German gun.

31
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Old Bill had seen it and stayed there after trying to pop the gunner himself.

32
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
The fourth dead man was porered Sam at rest at last.

33
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We looked around and found all the rest of the party had gone but another fit of sickness seized me and I could not move for a long time.

34
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Sambro stayed with me.

35
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
We did not go back.

36
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
We had to crawl a distance to avoid the machine gun fire but the main fighting had shifted over to the left.

37
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.000
A light vapor was stealing over the ground making it harder to see and I stumbled over a body as we found the road bank.

38
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
It was the professor.

39
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Riddle with bullets dead.

40
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
He was covered with mud.

41
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
He had lost his steel helmet.

42
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
He had evidently lost in the darkness and there he lay after years of study and culture with glass eyes and face upturned to the sky.

43
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
A smashed cog of the war machine with not a hope of burial accepting by a chance shell.

44
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And the mist thickened and rolled suddenly over him.

45
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Night found us still crouched in our cover and I got up and went around the shell holes until I found old Bill and Johnson.

46
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
They told me that a relief was due and that there had been no orders.

47
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Then a corporal from another pontoon came and called to us to follow him.

48
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
We were to go back to EPRES.

49
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
The 16th Battalion was relieving us.

50
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:50.000
We went and met the incoming man by our old trench where we're joined by the remainder of the company and heard that big Glen had been killed.

51
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
That is he died gloriously in the fighting at the graph house.

52
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
All that long drag back was a hideous nightmare.

53
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
The track was worse than when we had come and then the shelling was inciscent.

54
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Incessant.

55
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
We moved with infinite slowness.

56
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Every step of struggle, a tearing physical effort and a vast noise was all thundering, rolling, clamor that dulled our thinking.

57
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Mercifully, some smothering, some of our agonized impressions of that night before.

58
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:38.000
The November rains were chilling us, freezing us, our feet were always soggy and we were almost despondent.

59
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
All that time we had been out, we had talked but little.

60
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Each man seemed busy with his own thoughts, disinclined to speak to one another.

61
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
There had been too many of our friends killed.

62
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
The men we had been with for months.

63
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I found that McCloud and farmer had died in the mud.

64
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Egglestone had been wounded and placed on a stretcher and then he and his bearers were all blown to fragments by a big shell.

65
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And porered, flinned, had been killed.

66
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000
We seemed to move in a days to do things as if we were automatons.

67
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
When it grew dark, we moved again to form a new line.

68
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
The hun spotted us and started shelling while machine gun fire raked the ground.

69
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Up him and I were together as we started digging, I saw a body just in front of us, a big man with his equipment over his great coat.

70
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Catch hold of that stiff, I said to up him.

71
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Pull him back here and we'll use him for part of our parapet.

72
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
He stared at me.

73
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Don't yell, don't touch him.

74
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I seized the corpse myself, rolling it over into place, and up him spring from where he had been,

75
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
spading and commenced out new hole over to the right.

76
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
A salvo of shells came and exploded.

77
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Wizzing fragments were all around me, but I was not touched.

78
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Up him fell and was dead when I reached him.

79
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
There was a strange cry further on.

80
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
It was the sergeant major who should have gone to the depot, the old original.

81
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.000
He and insisted and coming in for one more trip and his jaw had been carried away by shrapnel.

82
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
He died before morning.

83
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Two other men were down, Johnson and Baron both wounded.

84
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
The shelling continued all that night and the next day.

85
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:46.000
We had dug deep, v-shaped pits, connecting some of them, and there we crouched, grey faces under muddy helmets.

86
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Red, rimmed eyes, staring, dazed, wandering, our brains numbed beyond thinking by the incest and explosions.

87
00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
One of the new men pitched down between our shelter and the next one.

88
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
He was pierced in a dozen places, and one arm had been sheared from his body by shrapnel.

89
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Mickey sat beside me, shuddering, half-stoned, staring, unseeing.

90
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:24.000
His limbs twitching, conversively at each concussion.

91
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And that right there is a couple of pages worth of reading of the book.

92
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And we go on written by a guy by the name of Will Bird, who was a Canadian soldier that fought in World War I.

93
00:08:47.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And like I said, that's just a couple of pages from the book, but the pages go on and on and on just like that war did.

94
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And you you experience like the amount of people killed around him, wounded around him.

95
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
It's horrific.

96
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And it's hard to even fathom.

97
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:29.000
What that did to these men before, during and after combat, physically and mentally and psychologically.

98
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And the physical part, these are things that you can see.

99
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
You can see those wounds. You can understand them.

100
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But the psychological part is perhaps the hardest to understand.

101
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Now I say that this podcast is about human nature.

102
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And the reason it is and the reason that I focus on human nature is because in my opinion, in order to lead people, you have to understand people.

103
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
You have to understand what their nature is. You have to understand human nature.

104
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And a lot of human nature boils down to psychology.

105
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And I recently got a recommendation from a trooper out on the inner webs, who recommended a book called Psychology for the Fighting Man.

106
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And this is a book that was first printed in 1943.

107
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And the book is an incredible book.

108
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
It's filled with an immense amount of very useful information.

109
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And it's written as almost like a mental guide to the American military men that are getting ready to go fight the Germans and the Japanese in World War II.

110
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Obviously, 1943, that's when it's written.

111
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
This is right in the middle of World War II.

112
00:10:49.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And even though the book is 75 years old, the information that's in it, the knowledge that is contained inside of it, can still be utilized today in any leadership situation.

113
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And in fact, this book is so dense with information that I'm actually going to split it into two separate podcasts so that we can go into some more detail and not end up with a 14 hour podcast.

114
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So, let's kick it off.

115
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Going into this book, as I said, the title of the book is Psychology for the Fighting Man.

116
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And the subtitle is what you should know about yourself and others.

117
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:49.000
It kicks off part one, a psychology and combat. When the British 8th Army pursued the retreating access forces from Egypt through Libya, they found a long route.

118
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
They found along the route, great quantities of abandoned equipment.

119
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Some tanks and guns in perfect condition and gasoline for the tanks and ammunition for the guns.

120
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000
The physical material of a large access force was there, but it was useless to the access.

121
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
There were no men left to operate it.

122
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:17.000
You keep hearing it said that men cannot fight without weapons, but it is just a true that weapons cannot fight without men.

123
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
An army is men.

124
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Not any men at all for a crowd of men may only be a mob, but trained and equipped men.

125
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:38.000
What sort of equipment do men of an army need? Plains, tanks, guns and jeeps, mortars, grenades, rifles and bayonets, camouflage and mess kits.

126
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Above all food and water.

127
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Everything that the ordinance and quartermaster can supply, but that is not all.

128
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:57.000
No, the men need morale. They need courage. They must have confidence in each other and the belief in ultimate victory.

129
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Who is the quartermaster who can issue stocks of courage and confidence?

130
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Yet these are essential weapons.

131
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
So, let's start off with a great point.

132
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Where do you get your courage issued?

133
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
From the quartermaster, not from the supply guy.

134
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
No, it's got to come from somewhere else.

135
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:25.000
It is just as important part of winning a war as tanks, planes, bullets and bombs.

136
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Going on, and the army must have leaders too, plenty of them.

137
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Seos and NCOs, who supplies them?

138
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Besides leaders, it must have all sorts of special abilities and skills.

139
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Mechanical ability in particular is needed in this new mechanized war.

140
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Ability in a drive trucks, pilot ability, mathematical ability, cooking ability, clerks skills, lots and lots of abilities.

141
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
You can't fight a war without them.

142
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And the army needs efficiency too.

143
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And efficiency means not only effective organization.

144
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
There is also basic efficiency of the individual man.

145
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:14.000
His strength and health, his resistance to hardship and fatigue, his alertness, even when fatigue and despite freezing cold or exhausting heat.

146
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Toughness of body is a weapon indispensable to victory.

147
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
This book is so straightforward.

148
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
It's just so straightforward.

149
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And it doesn't pull any punches.

150
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
It's one of the best things about this.

151
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And you can tell it's written, it's directed for it like the frontline,

152
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Grunt Trooper.

153
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
That's who it's directed at.

154
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And not just the infantry guy, but anybody in the army doing any job.

155
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And it's refreshing to read something that's a straightforward as this book is.

156
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Going on, the army has a perpetual problem of psychological logistics, a problem of the supply of motives and emotions of aptitudes and abilities of habits and wisdom.

157
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
How does it get this mental material to the right places at the right time?

158
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
That is what this book is about.

159
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
So again, it's looking at the psychological aspect of warfare and saying,

160
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
How do you deliver these necessary supplies?

161
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
We need courage, right? We need abilities. We need emotions.

162
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
We need aptitudes. We need the right habits. How do you deliver those?

163
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Back to the book. If the army cannot find a man with needed ability,

164
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
an effort is made to find one with an aptitude for being trained in that ability.

165
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And then it trains them all.

166
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
In part by teaching them the rules and the techniques in part by giving them practice.

167
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
No troops are ready to go into combat until their training period is over.

168
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And even then they are still green troops.

169
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
The training is still going on in combat until finally the men are seasoned troops.

170
00:15:49.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Have learned how to meet the unexpected emergencies of war and have acquired that competence and confidence that is the basis of their courage.

171
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:10.000
It is this human material that determines more than any other one thing whether an army will win or lose.

172
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Guns and chow are essential too, but given equally of supply, victory goes to the better troops.

173
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Troops composed of men who know their jobs and do them willingly and well, men with initiative to act by themselves,

174
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
the trained troops which make up the season to army.

175
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:37.000
There are more over fundamental differences between people that affect their ways of fighting and their abilities to fight.

176
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Differentes are not however due to blood as the Nazis teach, but mostly due to training, tradition, home life and other things that have a powerful effect on the character of men.

177
00:16:50.000 --> 00:17:02.000
War is waged best by choosing methods of warfare best adapted to the nature of our own people and opposed to the nature of the enemy peoples.

178
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
American men have no particular love for killing.

179
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
For the most part, they hate killing.

180
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
They think it is wrong, sinful, or nearly punishable by death.

181
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:21.000
They do not look upon death as a beautiful and glorious experience, and most of them do not consider the military life as a suitable life work.

182
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:34.000
War to American men is a dirty, disagreeable business to be gotten over as soon as possible so that we as a nation can get along with what we were happily engrossed in.

183
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Inventing, producing, growing, making life more useful and satisfying.

184
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Americans can stand along hard pole.

185
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
They look forward, not back.

186
00:17:49.000 --> 00:18:01.000
They are slow to accept war, will not go all out until they are attacked or are sure their ideals are engraved danger.

187
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:10.000
But once they have started, they do not stop or spare themselves until the goal of victory seems to them to be secure.

188
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Perhaps in 1919, they made a mistake about having already made the world safe for democracy, but they would not have stopped, had they not fought themselves safe.

189
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Nor will they stop now.

190
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
They are not demoralized by temporary adversity or single defeats.

191
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:43.000
So, some good info right there, clearly trying to set the mental attitude of the American young American soldiers that are reading this.

192
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
We can stay at the long hard pole.

193
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
If you mess with us, we're going to finish it.

194
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:59.000
We're not demoralized by temporary adversity or single defeats, doesn't matter. You want a battle right on, watch this, we'll be back.

195
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Continuing on, it has been said that war is inevitable.

196
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
That men are so made that they just have to fight.

197
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:16.000
That is true if you mean they have to be aggressive, that they need to have power and to use it, that they are forever wanting to change things that are hard to change,

198
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
so as that they can get on with better living.

199
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:31.000
But the fact is that they do not have to fight each other, and not many Americans agree with Hitler in thinking fighting other nations a good thing for any nation,

200
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
even when the ugliest ugly business ends in victory.

201
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
There are other things than men and nations to fight.

202
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Men can fight calamity and disaster, flood, fire and famine with anger and zest, and even fight nature to prevent disasters happening.

203
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:58.000
They fight disease, having for a century been waging effective war upon it with a new mermal conquest which history now records.

204
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
They fight for freedom.

205
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Freedom to worship as they wish. Freedom to think and speak as they please.

206
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Freedom from want and poverty, freedom from fear.

207
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000
That's the American and Democratic philosophy. The reason why America is now at war.

208
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Every American ought to understand this to know why a nation that wants peace has to go to war.

209
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Because nobody likes murder, you have to kill the murderers.

210
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
You cannot get along without police, and this war is a policing job.

211
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
It's a large-scale job because it is a total war.

212
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:50.000
So clearly this book is answering a lot of questions for an 18-year-old kid that's heading out to war,

213
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
maybe doesn't fully understand why or what's happening.

214
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
And here it is, just laying out, look, these people are bad.

215
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.000
We're good. We're the police of the world, which sometimes in today's time,

216
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
people take that as a negative. Like we can't be the world police,

217
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
but here he straight up, this straight up saying, yes, we are the world police.

218
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
There's bad guys. We're going to go put him down.

219
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000
And it's interesting too. Nobody likes murder. You have to kill murderers.

220
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
That's the way it's got to be.

221
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Again, you know, these days we get so desensitized by media, right?

222
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
By movies and video games and music talking about killing.

223
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
And I like that's just, that's the way we grow up.

224
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000
But in these days, you had to convince people that, hey, this is the way it's going to go down.

225
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
You're going to go kill people. And that's okay.

226
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Total war is just what its name implies.

227
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
War on all fronts with all possible weapons.

228
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
There's the home front as well as all the battle fronts.

229
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000
There are also the military front, the economic front, and the psychological front.

230
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Military economic and psychological warfare make up total war.

231
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
The Germans had that big idea first, but the Americans can fight the devil with his own fire,

232
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
and a hotter one, and are doing it.

233
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
The three kinds of warfare are all related.

234
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000
A military success may also be an economic victory if it results in the capture of great quantities of

235
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000
enemy material or blocks important supply routes to the enemy nation.

236
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Or it can be a psychological victory if it lowers enemy morale,

237
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:48.000
helps to make soldiers expect defeat leads the enemy people to be ready to submit.

238
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:56.000
What I like about this idea of total war is when you apply it to other parts of your life.

239
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Right? If you apply it to business and how you can't just focus on one aspect of business,

240
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
you can't just focus on, hey, we're going to go out and create something new.

241
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Guess what? We got to create something new. We got to sell it.

242
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
We got to figure out the way to get the cost to produce down.

243
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
We got to figure out how we're going to beat our competitors.

244
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
We got to figure out how we're going to spread.

245
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000
You got to figure out all these things total war in business in life total war.

246
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Right? How do you win the total your life is war?

247
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Right? Your life is a war.

248
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
You're fighting against all these things that are happening and you're fighting to win.

249
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
You're fighting to be healthy.

250
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
You're fighting to be financially stable.

251
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
You're fighting to take care of your family in the best possible way.

252
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
It's total war.

253
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
And all these things you have to fight all these fronts at the same time all the time.

254
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
That's why you can't sleep at night because it's total war in life.

255
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Yeah. That's what you're doing.

256
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
So you can be like winning certain battles in life, you know?

257
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Like you can have a great job making great money.

258
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
But don't exercise and be poor health.

259
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Or opposite or what? There's so many like just as bad old as you know?

260
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Yeah, absolutely.

261
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
And you have to be paying attention to those.

262
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
You have to pay attention to all the fronts.

263
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Yeah.

264
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
And there's a lot of times where people get focused on one front.

265
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Yeah.

266
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
And it just doesn't. It doesn't help.

267
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
And even like inside of a business,

268
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
you'll get a business when they just focus on one thing.

269
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Yeah.

270
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
And they'll miss that they're getting flanked.

271
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Yeah.

272
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Yeah.

273
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
A lot of those times in this goes in life obviously.

274
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
That's what harm thinking of it.

275
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Yeah. And companies where they focus so much on one thing.

276
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
And then a lot of times is because that thing is like,

277
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
it has a big payoff.

278
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
You know, like you get it seems like dang I'm getting ahead huge times.

279
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Especially like at home, right?

280
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Where let me just put in just a few more hours of work.

281
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Right. A week from one to much three months.

282
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
And dang that paycheck comes in and you do so well for the come.

283
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
You go to work you the hero kind of thing.

284
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
And you're like dang I'm getting ahead big time.

285
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
But like something else will kind of falter which won't show itself right away.

286
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
You know, then when you like how you see get flanked,

287
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
you're like dang I hope just flanked.

288
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
You got to get focused on all fronts.

289
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Continuing on an economic success of our own can lead to a military defeat of the enemy.

290
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
If it robs of him of essential supplies,

291
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
it can become a psychological victory.

292
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
If it disheartens him and makes him ready or to give in.

293
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
On the other hand, of course,

294
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
a military victory is useless if it leads to a psychological defeat.

295
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
The Japanese may have done a great may have done great military damage at Pearl Harbor,

296
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:43.000
but it resulted in net loss to them because the effect of uniting the Americans in anger.

297
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Real defeats other than death are psychological in the end.

298
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
That's pretty powerful.

299
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Real defeats other than death itself are just psychological, right?

300
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
So they're just psychological.

301
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
The enemy gives up surrenders.

302
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
You have to kill the enemy or make him surrender.

303
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
There isn't any other kind of victory.

304
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
If he is fanatical, you may just have to kill him.

305
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Americans would rather just get him to surrender.

306
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
So this is something that's so important to remember is that

307
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
if you get beat, it's psychological.

308
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
If you're still alive, it's just a psychological defeat.

309
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
You just need to reframe it and how you're going to come back and win next time.

310
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Psychological Warfare is the newest arm in war.

311
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
It is directed at opinion, belief, confidence, courage, and the will to fight.

312
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000
It is both defensive and offensive for it tries to build up morale in our people and troops

313
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
and to break down the morale of the enemy.

314
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
The chief weapon of psychological warfare is propaganda.

315
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
The radio and the press are used to bolster on the home front.

316
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
The enemy is reached by newspapers and leaflets drop from airplanes and by short wave radio.

317
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Propaganda, in spite of what many people think is not necessarily dishonest,

318
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:11.000
truth is often the best propaganda, especially when it is fed to persons who are starving for it.

319
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
The most effective propaganda must be founded on fact.

320
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Must start from some important event that actually happened and is known to be true.

321
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Then the propaganda interprets the event, much as a good lawyer, interprets evidence in favor of his client,

322
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000
or as the honest advertiser makes a claim for his product.

323
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
This is another very important part when you're in a leadership position.

324
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
How much of being a leader is making sure that the propaganda gets out there?

325
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Have you ever heard of this expression when someone says, you're not really going to tell your story?

326
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Have you ever heard that before? Like a company.

327
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
They're out there trying to do great things and they are.

328
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
They're working hard and they're having some success but nobody knows it.

329
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:04.000
And when I work with companies, there are sometimes companies, no one even inside the companies knows about the successes that they're having.

330
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
They're failing to even spread the word within their own company.

331
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:18.000
And so they think they're getting crushed by the competitors because the competitors get with the competitors great at propaganda.

332
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Every time the competitors sign a new client, they put out a big LinkedIn post.

333
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
They put in a big social media blast.

334
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Hey, we're just the same.

335
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
It's great to welcome a board, our newest client.

336
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Meanwhile, a company is not doing that.

337
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
So everyone inside the company doesn't know that we're signing all these new clients.

338
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:48.000
So this idea of propaganda is very important in warfare and in leadership and in business.

339
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Yeah, and at the same time, you might have heard about this.

340
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Probably have, you know how.

341
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
I think it was Facebook, maybe Instagram, I forget.

342
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000
But they did like some study where it like it actually was linked to people getting depressed because of that.

343
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:11.000
And it's this this concept that concept that you just said, well, you know, people, this is nothing new where people they'll post just their highlights of their life.

344
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Oh, yeah.

345
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
And then like me as just a normal person, I'm looking at everyone else's highlights of their life.

346
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Dang, I don't live that kind of life.

347
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
I'm not traveling to Thailand.

348
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Yeah.

349
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
You know, all these places.

350
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
And maybe I do, but that was like once last year.

351
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
And this, you know, it's seen me.

352
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
So it kind of, that it's like propaganda.

353
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
Maybe on purpose.

354
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Oh, that's definitely not.

355
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:39.000
But it's like, yeah, it's like the perception, you know, where you have you, you know, your life and it's like the highlights are like one out of a thousand.

356
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Yeah.

357
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Everyone else seemingly is one out of one.

358
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Yeah.

359
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
It's just all highlights.

360
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
There's actually another sushi restaurant tonight.

361
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
You know, where the bunch of girls.

362
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Oh, yeah.

363
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
And a lamb or guini.

364
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
You know, when we're getting all that stuff, man.

365
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
And it's like everyone.

366
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Yeah.

367
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Except me.

368
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Yeah.

369
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
And also it's kind of that feeling back.

370
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Oh, echo Charles.

371
00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
He's not.

372
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Yeah.

373
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Yeah.

374
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
What ever.

375
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Not a fall for it.

376
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Not a fall.

377
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Yeah.

378
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
No, it's true.

379
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
It's true.

380
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:07.000
And that stuff does.

381
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000
It does build up.

382
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
It does.

383
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
And that's like propaganda in your own life.

384
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Now, believe you.

385
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
I'm not recommending that you do good propaganda.

386
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
All your it's the grab to show your positive life.

387
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
No.

388
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
No, I'm not saying that.

389
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
I'm saying don't believe the hype.

390
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Military psychology.

391
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Psychological warfare is not however the only way which psychology contributes to success and combat.

392
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
There are hundreds of others and soldiers and officers need to know what psychologists know and

393
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
what psychological methods can find out.

394
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:42.000
For instance, soldiers need to understand men in order to understand themselves and their comrades.

395
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.000
And officers must learn how to interpret and influence the conduct of those for whom they are responsible.

396
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
So this is exactly what I say all the time.

397
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000
If you want to be a good leader, you got to understand people.

398
00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:01.000
The soldier must know about human needs, motives and emotions about fear when it comes what to do about it.

399
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:08.000
About anger when it is useful when it makes trouble about zest, which is the core of good morale in a unit,

400
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:15.000
about anxiety and the sense of insecurity, about indignation against the enemy and irritation against comrades,

401
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
about the relation of food and of sex to military life.

402
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:33.000
He should know also of the relation of all these things to morale and thus learn how to avoid bad morale and to build up good morale.

403
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Clearly, and this is not just true for combat.

404
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
This is true for life.

405
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Every soldier ought to understand further the problems of the mental adjustment of men first to the army later to combat.

406
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Why men feel insecure?

407
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
What makes for courage?

408
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
The signs of approaching breakdown.

409
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
How to prevent breakdown and what to do about it when it happens.

410
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:04.000
The selection and training of leaders for the army has become one of the most important problems in the psychology of war.

411
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Not enough is known about it, but what is known to some should be known to all.

412
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
The good leader is the man who builds up morale.

413
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
How does he do it?

414
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
What kind of man must he be?

415
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.000
If he is a poor leader, can he become a better one?

416
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
And there are mobs and panics to be understood too.

417
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Civilian mobs and panics may be the concern of the soldier when the populace gets mixed up with the fighting,

418
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
or when the enemy's home front begins to break.

419
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Panics may moreover occur in well-disciplined troops if all the conditions for panic are present.

420
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
What are these conditions?

421
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Why are seasoned troops panicked less than green troops?

422
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:59.000
The army placed each man with his talents where he will be used to his best advantage,

423
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:05.000
but each individual must know how to get the most out of his talents.

424
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:13.000
The primitive fact of combat is that man pushes when he encounters an obstacle to the achievement of his desire.

425
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Push his more if blocked, gets angry if still thwarted, and then fights.

426
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:29.000
But to this fighting he eventually brings all of the knowledge and skill that is made him supreme among the animals.

427
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:36.000
He fights by learning how to use his eyes at night and learning how to arrange a system that will let him hear inside of an airplane.

428
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
He fights by selecting good leaders and good truck drivers.

429
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:49.000
He fights by understanding human nature in order to build up good morale that will overcome fear.

430
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:56.000
He fights by saying the right thing in the right way to the right people at the right time,

431
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
and sometimes that is propaganda.

432
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:15.000
He uses every resource of science and intelligence including psychology. He has to for this is total war.

433
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
I love to get about that.

434
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Every aspect of your life is to be prepared for total war, which by the way you're in. You might not be in combat at this moment in time, but you're fighting.

435
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
You're fighting all the time. You have to bring every asset, every resource that you have available.

436
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
You have to bring it to fight because this is total war.

437
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Now, the book goes into some pretty big sections right here. One of them is a weapon.

438
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
It's a weapon and then hearing as a tool.

439
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:59.000
It literally talks about how to see better things you can do to make your night vision better,

440
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
how to preserve your night vision, how to see sharper.

441
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Just all those things you talk about camouflage and stuff.

442
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:14.000
And then it talks about hearing and what you need to hear and how you can adjust your hearing and how to listen sharply.

443
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
I'm not going to talk about the site piece, but I'm going to talk about the noise.

444
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
There's some interesting points about noise.

445
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Loud sounds, especially when they are sudden and strange are natural causes of fear.

446
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Many sounds are terrifying.

447
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:35.000
A sudden loud noise like the discharge of a pistol will make anyone blink and jump. It will start to limb.

448
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.000
This is true even of well-trained men who pride themselves on their familiarity with firearms.

449
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000
It is an instantaneous response that may be all over before the eye can see it.

450
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000
It shows up however in slow motion pictures.

451
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000
Season troops get so that they don't appear to pay any particular attention to the den of battle.

452
00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Even horses will stand still under the rising roar of a diving bomber will only toss ahead impatiently.

453
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:12.000
The experienced soldier on the other hand needs first to become adapted to the noises of war.

454
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
He must be exposed to them in training as much as possible.

455
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
After the noise has become familiar, its loudness will not affect him so greatly in combat.

456
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Control over noise makes it less fearful.

457
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
You don't mind the noise of gunfire, so much as you are the one who is doing the shooting.

458
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.000
So talking about getting people used to the loud noises that you are going to come up against.

459
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
This is something that we used to do.

460
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
I don't even know if guys do it anymore because it's probably not that smart.

461
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
But we used to do immediate action drills with no ear protection in.

462
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
So we'd get used to shooting guns and having all that just massively loud noise.

463
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:55.000
We wouldn't do it every time, but we would do several rounds with no ear protection.

464
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
This is broken in theory.

465
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Now, in current times, guys have these nice headsets that have noise, there are noise canceling headsets, so they're actually pretty awesome.

466
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
So it's not that big of a deal anymore.

467
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000
But back in the day, they wanted to make sure, hey, you've got to realize how loud this is going to be if you get in a firefight.

468
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.000
If you get in your first firefight, you've never had an M60 machine gun two feet away from your ear.

469
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
You get getting crazy laying down a hundred round belts.

470
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
It'll be a shock to your system.

471
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.000
So that's what, and not to mention, they're hugging, you know, grenade simulators at you and artillery simulators.

472
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
There's explosions going off because that's what that's what they're trying to do.

473
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Get you used to that scenario.

474
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Men subjected to the excessive noises of war over a long period.

475
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Sometimes it build up an over-sensiveness to any sort of loud, sharp report.

476
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
They are in the state of a man with a hangover.

477
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000
The bang of a door will make them jump.

478
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
A loud shout is painful.

479
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
The noise of a truck exhaust is frightening.

480
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000
In the hospitals where men are convolicing from bad cases of these warnerves,

481
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:11.000
the dropping of a pan will startle a ward full of sleeping men so violently that the jerk will bring them out of their sleep and even.

482
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Out of their beds and onto the floor.

483
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:26.000
But this state of nerves, the link to in their minds with the noise and produced by the noise is do mainly to more disturbing things that have become associated with the noise.

484
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Noise is just as loud and originally just as distressing as the noises of war.

485
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:39.000
If they are only just a part of everyday work or fun are tolerated, men become used to the dinner of a boiler factory or a pneumatic drill.

486
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
It may defen them but it does not demoralize them.

487
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
So that's pretty obvious, right?

488
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:53.000
What's making these noise is horrible to use because every time a bomb goes off, you see your friends get blown up and killed and you're afraid that the same thing is going to happen to you.

489
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Whereas a pneumatic drill, you're just making a bunch of noise.

490
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
So you're not that worried about it.

491
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000
This was, again, there's a lot of real basic information.

492
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
You can imagine this book being issued to frontline troops, but I had to call this one out here.

493
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
To sooner or later, most soldiers have the experience of getting lost.

494
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000
And heavy words are jungle, just posplicate lost a few yards, just a few that yards off the trail.

495
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000
It gives a man a peculiar helpless feeling.

496
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:34.000
You are so accustomed all your life to knowing where you are and who you are and about what time it is that the feeling of not knowing one of these things comes to the end.

497
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
These things come to the great shock.

498
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
And then it goes on a little further.

499
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
It says, a compass is a big help.

500
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
But I was like, yeah, yes, it is.

501
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Indeed, there's another real captain obvious.

502
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
It is best to have a map in your pocket when you get lost.

503
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
If you can't have one, then you have to see one before you get into strange country.

504
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
So that's real obvious too.

505
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
The more a soldier knows about maps, the better equipy is for combat duty.

506
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
His training and how to read them and what to look for on them.

507
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
If he keeps practicing it, it should enable him to find himself if he ever gets lost and any training knows from map.

508
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:23.000
And the reason I called that part out is, think about all the situations that you get in, where you have the opportunity to gather some intelligence before you go into them.

509
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000
You know, if you're going for a job interview, what can you know about that company?

510
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
If you're going to meet with a client, you've never met with before.

511
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
How much information can you have?

512
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
With these days, you can Google someone, you get all kinds of information.

513
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:41.000
You go to their LinkedIn account, you can find out where they went to school and what sport they played, whatever you go to their Facebook page.

514
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000
You go to their give pull-up articles that were written about them, and there's all kinds of intelligence you can gather.

515
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:53.000
There's no reason to go into a meeting blind anymore without knowing the terrain that you're getting into, without understanding the culture that you're going into.

516
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000
There's no reason for it.

517
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Next, work in the army is much more than just shouldering a rifle and doing long foot marches.

518
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Soldiers work at several hundred different kinds of fighting jobs, and at even more kinds of jobs,

519
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:19.000
to directly relate it to combat and some not, which can be filled with men already trained for them or men who have the necessary aptitude for learning one of the jobs quickly.

520
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Leaders have the responsibility for seeing that the right man gets the right job and when mistakes are made, that misfits are transferred.

521
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
And this thing is this where this book gets pretty politically incorrect.

522
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
It's basically saying, look, some people can't do this jobs.

523
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Some people aren't fit for these jobs and some people aren't fit for these other jobs.

524
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Continuing on, thousands know how to drive a tractor, how to repair an ignition system.

525
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Well, the castings repair watches other timing instruments or road transit keep accounts.

526
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Carve carcasses of beef develop photographs.

527
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
The army needs many men who can do these things.

528
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
The British found that out in the first world war.

529
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
At first, they neglected to save their specialists.

530
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:11.000
They sent to the front professional men engineers and men in skilled trades.

531
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Many were killed in the early months of the war later than need for them in special posts behind the line became acute.

532
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:29.000
So yeah, this is all about forming up an army of civilians that have skills and saying, oh, you've been a truck driver for whatever, for six years in the civilian sector.

533
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Guess what you're going to do for us, you're going to drive a truck.

534
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Oh, you're a butcher guess what we need butchers and right on down the line and you can imagine.

535
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:45.000
World war one probably them being very short sighted on how long that war was going to last in like, oh, oh, you're a mechanic cool.

536
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
We're just going to send you the front with everyone else and you're going to die like everyone else.

537
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:57.000
And you look up in six months or a year and they don't have the necessary support logistically to carry on the war.

538
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:04.000
How soldiers differ.

539
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Men differ just as much inability to learn different sorts of duties as they do in size of feet in height or in weight.

540
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Some are as much as three times as able as others.

541
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000
I like that. Hey, some people are just three times more capable than you. That's the way it is.

542
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Most of course are just about average.

543
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Some men cannot learn a three figure telephone number by hearing it once. Some can learn as many as nine figures.

544
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:45.000
The average is around six or seven. Have you heard that before? Have you heard that the reason our numbers are seven inches long is because that's about the average that a human can memorize.

545
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:58.000
I'm saying no, I haven't and that's very interesting. I heard that could that possibly be not gross science, but urban.

546
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Yeah, could it be an imagined it could be. It's true. I like it.

547
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Yeah, it's awesome actually. Well, you, well, you have your doctorate in gross science.

548
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:24.000
And urban legend back to the book. Some men starting from scratch can learn in eight weeks to receive and send radio code at 16 words per minute.

549
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000
It takes others twenty two weeks.

550
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Some men used to handling certain types of machinery can learn to handle certain kinds of weapons much faster than others.

551
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:46.000
So the problem is to understand and measure aptitude aptitude is potential skill. The capacity for learning to do something quickly and accurately when given the chance to learn.

552
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Both speed and accuracy are important in learning. A soldier needs to learn rapidly, but also to be accurate at what he's learned.

553
00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:01.000
And men differ from one to another in both ways.

554
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:10.000
For one thing, men differ greatly in the speed with which they learned. Some aviation cadets can solo solo after four hours of instruction.

555
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Others are not allowed to solo even after 14 hours. Here the quick learners are urgently needed.

556
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Slow learners tie up the training planes too long. Besides quick learning might mean a shorter war.

557
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Yet the army cannot do without the slow learners. Man power is needed. And there are many military jobs which require other qualities than speed of learning.

558
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Jobs which the slow learners will prefer to have.

559
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Men also differ in speed and accuracy of reaction. The average driver requires from one half to three quarters of a second to put on the brakes after the stoplight goes red.

560
00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Yet some can apply the brakes in three tenths of a second. Others use up to a whole second.

561
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:09.000
These are important differences for riflemen and machine gunners as well as for truck drivers every tenth of a second counts in battle.

562
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000
You ever see that thing when they were.

563
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
They would do like the speed test for conamer Grecker.

564
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
And he was the fastest athlete they had tested.

565
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.000
He had like reaction time. When you see something you touch a button or whatever.

566
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Whenever they have these little tests set up then apparently Grecker was the fastest athlete that they had tested.

567
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Which is crazy.

568
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
It is crazy because you know some of these baseball players.

569
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000
I think that would be the fastest high and high coordination.

570
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:51.000
I mean, yeah. I've talked to my head seems like it. I mean because those balls come quick.

571
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Yeah. There is a test you can do when we're kids.

572
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
You know in science class.

573
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
You know they you get a ruler.

574
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Yeah.

575
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
And then you put a put it on your finger.

576
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Between your fingers right at the zero mark.

577
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
He dropped it and how quick you can.

578
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
How far do your fingers have to be open?

579
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
I don't know because it seems like that could be an advantage.

580
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Little bit of my grandfather used to do this.

581
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
He was called the dollar drop.

582
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Okay.

583
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
And he would fold the dollar lengthwise only to make it kind of aerodynamic.

584
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Yeah.

585
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
And if you can catch the dollar you could you could keep it.

586
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Okay.

587
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Yeah.

588
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000
It sounds pretty easy.

589
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Doesn't it?

590
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Yes.

591
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Sir it does.

592
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Some people can't catch that dollar.

593
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000
But yeah.

594
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:33.000
So it's the.

595
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Yeah.

596
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
So you think if you're you know you're saying you just said how far your fingers.

597
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Yeah.

598
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000
The thing is for the experiment as long as you designate kind of that.

599
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.000
No.

600
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Or even eyeball it.

601
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Yeah.

602
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
You know it might be a millimeter difference.

603
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
But you know usually it's like.

604
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
But there's always those people are looking for that edge.

605
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Right.

606
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
So it's actually a little bit like.

607
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Because I'm thinking I would be.

608
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Figure out how.

609
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Because I used to do that with a dollar drop right.

610
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
I'd get my fingers here.

611
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Yes.

612
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
That makes sense when the you know the dollar drop has more stakes.

613
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000
First year.

614
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000
But even the most important pulls out that.

615
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:13.000
You're really the guy in science class who wanted to win though even though wasn't a competition.

616
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Of course it's a competition.

617
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000
So.

618
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.000
And I don't know.

619
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000
I'm pretty sure that that stuff can be trained as well.

620
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
And that's one thing that.

621
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000
You know when you when you're bringing your kids up.

622
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000
You bring them up and you make them play multiple different sports.

623
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000
You don't focus on too young because they become they don't they don't develop

624
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
up the broader athletic skills.

625
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000
So you're supposed to.

626
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Get them involved in a bunch of different sports.

627
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000
And those kids will end up even if you took one kid and you say,

628
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000
Oh, you're just going to do 100% football is whole life and you took another kid and you did multiple sports.

629
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000
And but you did like a little bit more of a focus on football.

630
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
The chances are.

631
00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
The kid that did multiple sports, but focused on football is going to do better than the kid that just did football.

632
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
From what I understand.

633
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
I'm sure there's some broad science people out there that will.

634
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Object to my statement.

635
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Makes sense, you know, we brought more broadly athletic.

636
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Yeah, like you can and pretty I do imagine you be able to learn quicker too because your body is used to moving.

637
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000
No different ways rather than just the way.

638
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Yeah, because what are you doing things are a little bit different out on the football field.

639
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Right.

640
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
There's little situations that can unfold.

641
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
And if you're athletically adept at adapting to various situations, you're going to be better off.

642
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Yeah.

643
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000
That's true.

644
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Going on.

645
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Men differ also in the speed and accuracy of perceiving.

646
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:44.000
One clerk can check in five minutes a company roster that takes another man 20 minutes.

647
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Some men can see a white target in the dark 400 yards away to others.

648
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:56.000
It is invisible at 200 yards range finders differ in their ability to tell the distances of different objects.

649
00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.000
When the job is seeing, you must choose the best seers.

650
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.000
So that's interesting because you can have someone that has bad reactions, but they'll see you really well.

651
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
And if you ever read and sure, at some point we'll do Chuck Yagers book on here.

652
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Matter of fact Chuck Yagers on Twitter.

653
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000
I don't know if you know that, but Chuck Yagers on Twitter.

654
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:21.000
And I'm gone back and forth a couple times people have said come on the podcast, but in his podcast or in his book,

655
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Yager, he just had incredible vision like he'd be flying information and he could see the enemy way before.

656
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000
And way before anyone else could see the enemy.

657
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000
He'd be like, oh, boggies at four o'clock, boom, we go.

658
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000
And because his eyesight was apparently just amazing.

659
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
And that used to be a big deal for fighter pilots.

660
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000
I think it's the less of a big deal now.

661
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Could you got radar and all that?

662
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000
So it's not as big of a deal as it used to be.

663
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Just your eyes against the enemy's eyes.

664
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Back to the book.

665
00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:02.000
There is however much more to a good soldier than speed and accuracy with which he learns acts and perceives.

666
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.000
Every man has interests, likes and dislikes.

667
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:13.000
These determine in part what he will do well and how fast he will improve.

668
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:21.000
A man's interest, for instance, usually determine what he will do with what he learns.

669
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Mirror exposure to training never made a skilled soldier.

670
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:36.000
It is the interested man who remembers and profits by his training and is ready to apply it to new situations.

671
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000
Right?

672
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000
So true.

673
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000
So true.

674
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
How true?

675
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000
It's just so true.

676
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
So true.

677
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:50.000
We don't, and what I think is really important about this from a business perspective is what they're basically saying is put the right people in the right job.

678
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:55.000
That's the overall concept to put the right people in the right jobs.

679
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
That's what you need to do.

680
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:05.000
If you've got someone that might not be super talented but they're very interested, they're probably the better higher than someone that's just got a bunch of talent but doesn't care.

681
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000
In fact, I'll go ahead and say they straight up are the better higher.

682
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.000
Yeah.

683
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.000
Yeah.

684
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000
They'll wind up learning like so quick and you're specific.

685
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Think.

686
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.000
You know, you're specific.

687
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000
They're into it.

688
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Someone that's not into it, that's bad.

689
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Oh, like someone who has like a major degree and you know, his resume is not a degree but like, hey, I'm really into whatever it is that you're doing.

690
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Like for instance, you like making videos, you're into it.

691
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Right?

692
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Sure.

693
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:43.000
If you didn't like making them, if you got no enjoyment from it, think of how horrible it would be to try to get you to do it.

694
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.000
It's pretty hard to get you to do a video right now and you actually like doing it.

695
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Yeah.

696
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Or, you know, like politics, right?

697
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
You know, how like some people, they like politics, some people don't.

698
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.000
So you get someone who likes politics and then news comes on.

699
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000
They're going to be all up in there, learning everything what's going on like today.

700
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000
You know, then someone who's not there like all the news on let me watch.

701
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000
Yeah.

702
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Well, that's an interesting, I thought you were going to say that people that are into pop because I actually, that's one case where I would disagree because a lot of times people that would be

703
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000
really like politics, you don't want them in politics because they're just political machines, right?

704
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000
You want a normal person.

705
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Oh, yeah.

706
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000
I just don't normal every day.

707
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
You know what the person that's like, you don't have to do.

708
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.000
I'm going to be president.

709
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
I'm going to be, I'm going to be in charge.

710
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Like that person you don't want to be president.

711
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Yeah.

712
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000
My question is like, look, I don't really want to do this.

713
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Yeah.

714
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:36.000
And I think the other thing is, because when it's all hungry for the political life, they're there.

715
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000
They're a arrogant person that thinks that they should be in charge of it and it's like now.

716
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Yeah.

717
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.000
I don't want it.

718
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.000
I don't want it.

719
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Like on TV, like so like me, if I watch, I don't know, like okay.

720
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.000
So well, that's kind of a good example because I'm interested in Hawaii.

721
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Yeah.

722
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
So, you know, I'm not like, but like, okay.

723
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000
So on, so I make videos, right?

724
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Any some some visual effects, whatever.

725
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.000
There's a YouTube channel called video copilot.

726
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Right.

727
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000
So all of this, it's mainly just tutorials on how to do stuff.

728
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000
That's all it is, really.

729
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000
So when that like if a new video comes out or something, man, I'm all up in there.

730
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000
All up in it, but you don't care.

731
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.000
But you're going to watch that thing and you're going to, you're going to, you're not even going to click on it.

732
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Not even close.

733
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000
No.

734
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000
Unless I was like, my wonderful one to take Echo's job.

735
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000
Or okay.

736
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000
So okay.

737
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Case in point.

738
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000
I'm not interested.

739
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Right.

740
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000
So I could barely even get through one of those videos.

741
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000
That's why I'd be like, now I'm going to go over here and do burpees.

742
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Yeah.

743
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.000
Exactly.

744
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
If I say, hey, Jock, go click on this video.

745
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000
This will make, you know, you're brought in your horizon.

746
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000
I don't know, whatever.

747
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000
Click on this video.

748
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000
And just watch the whole thing.

749
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Watch it five times.

750
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000
Actually.

751
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.000
Bruh, when you're done watching it five times, it's about everything went over your head.

752
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Yeah, don't care.

753
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000
Right.

754
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
You don't even care.

755
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:59.000
So advice from this book is put people that are interested in the job.

756
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Truly inherently interested in it.

757
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.000
They're going to do a better work even then maybe someone that's more talented than they are.

758
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Back to the book.

759
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Other personal differences besides interests and likes and dislikes are important, especially for some military tasks.

760
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:26.000
One may feel, one man may feel completely ad-ease in the transparent cage in which a bombadier must sit.

761
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:35.000
While another ordinarily dexterous is so upset in the exposed position that the pupils of his eyes dilate his fingers

762
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:40.000
and the bombadier can't manipulate the bomb site properly.

763
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.000
So there you go.

764
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:46.000
You got a guy that's probably a better maybe as quick a reaction times, but he's just scared to be inside the turret.

765
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Yeah.

766
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Two equally wise officers may not be equally good leaders.

767
00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:02.000
One is at ease with his men talking with them freely getting their slant on matters of importance

768
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.000
and giving his orders and directions readily.

769
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:12.000
The other, although he wants his men to like him and respond alertly and willingly to him as a leader,

770
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:21.000
cannot bring himself to feel free and confident with them and open up with them in a way to gain their confidence in liking in turn.

771
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000
The first is of course the better leader.

772
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000
So there you go.

773
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
That's like straight up, hey.

774
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:36.000
This person, if you're more comfortable talking to your troops, they're going to sense that and you're going to be better than someone that's not comfortable talking to the troops.

775
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Indeed, leadership is the quality that the army most needs.

776
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:50.000
All advancement brings with it responsibility and responsibility for the conduct of others requires leadership.

777
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:56.000
That's interesting because what's interesting about that is that is

778
00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:03.000
it goes into this later on talking about the, we probably won't cover until the next podcast on this book,

779
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:08.000
but talking about the, you know, our leaders born or made.

780
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:17.000
And this is clearly leaning a little bit towards born, clearly, which I agree with, I think leaders are born and made.

781
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:24.000
Yeah, it feels like a lot of times when people use the expression or they born, whether it be leaders, whether it be whatever, you know,

782
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000
or he's a natural, whatever.

783
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:35.000
I get the expression and I'm sending an angry, of course, but technically, like if you say if your leader is made or born,

784
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:43.000
born meaning like he wasn't trained at a very specific point to be a leader, he brought to the training or to the position,

785
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:48.000
just a bunch of like talent or whatever, but he probably learned that through like his life.

786
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000
What he was exposed to, what he was, you know, true.

787
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:59.000
But there are certain aptitudes that people have and those play it in fact.

788
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000
So if you have somebody that's really articulate, they're going to make a better leader than someone that's not our team.

789
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:12.000
But even if someone is articulate, they learn that through sort of life, there's no possible, but some of it, maybe there's a shorter tongue or something.

790
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Because they have to be genetic, what I'm saying, I don't know if there's an articulate gene.

791
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000
For sure, no, it's not a gene, it's your brain.

792
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:29.000
How much capacity do you have the process words quickly and assemble together and descend, this isn't put them out to your comprehensible statement.

793
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000
How can you do that? How well can you do that?

794
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Yeah, but you're not born and going out of to, I guess, yeah, it's like a process.

795
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Yeah, you have what, yeah, that's it.

796
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.000
What process or what size, process, or do you have in your brain?

797
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000
You got the old 486.

798
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
What is it?

799
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000
You got the new Pentium, whatever.

800
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000
No, I don't know.

801
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:51.000
No, I don't know.

802
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.000
I don't know.

803
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
It's like a I7 or I9.

804
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000
I have no idea.

805
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
Anyway, but no, because there's, there's artically people who don't talk fast.

806
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Or don't, yeah, that's not the idea.

807
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000
You're able to assemble there.

808
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Okay, here's another one.

809
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:11.000
And this one's, and I've talked about these before, but the ability to look at complex problems and simplify them.

810
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Sure, some of that is learned.

811
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Some people just are born with it.

812
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Some people learn it in the streets.

813
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:25.000
Yeah, I think my, I'm drawing back on my bro's science background.

814
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:30.000
And I do think, I believe, I'm under, I believe it.

815
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:36.000
It's a belief that you get it from like, like you're getting some of it from life.

816
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:44.000
But I guarantee if you take someone that had a twin brother and you, one of them would be more apt at some of them.

817
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000
Or apt at some things than the other one.

818
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:54.000
There's gotta be some things that you are better at than your brother naturally and some things that your brother's better at than you.

819
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.000
I don't know of any, but I mean, put it this way.

820
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
All the differences that we have, I feel like I can map it back to why.

821
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Because just being second born, I was born a little bit smaller too.

822
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Not looking me like a bigger kind of like, I don't want to be bigger.

823
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Especially people would compare too, you know, like growing up with a twin brother.

824
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
They always compare.

825
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
They always live a little bit tall.

826
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
They use reddish, skinny ones.

827
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Yes, or whatever.

828
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
They train that no more are the one.

829
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Anyway, the point is, I'm not saying, I'm not saying you're, I think you're probably right, of course.

830
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000
But I think it's mostly learned.

831
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Bro, people have a certain,

832
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
genetic cognitive capacity without question.

833
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Yeah.

834
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
That's not even debatable.

835
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Yes, I would not debatable.

836
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:50.000
So what we're talking about is the ability to take that cognitive capacity and steer it towards the articulation of language.

837
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.000
If you have more cognitive capacity, you'll be able to articulate language better.

838
01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:09.000
And there's probably little modules inside the brain that are genetic that have even more capacity for the grabbing and assembling of linguistic patterns together

839
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000
where they flow off the tongue rapidly and sensibly.

840
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000
And there's got to be part of your brain that's better at that just genetically.

841
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Now, of course, if you spend a lot of time in that arena, you will get better at it over time.

842
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.000
But there's got to be some just like you have X amount of fast twitch muscle.

843
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000
And echo Charles, like how hard did you work at your vertical jump?

844
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Did you guys test that in football?

845
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Yes.

846
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Okay.

847
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
What was the highest vertical jump you ever had?

848
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
39 and an hour.

849
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Okay.

850
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
That's pretty good, right?

851
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Is there a way that people on your team that worked harder than you if not harder that never got to 39 and a half inches?

852
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Probably yes.

853
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Actually, yes.

854
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Oh, I think that's a very good thing.

855
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Yeah, because I didn't really work exactly.

856
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I knew this was a loaded question.

857
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:10.000
So, yes, sir. So, somewhat, there was someone on your team that they worked and they trained and they were doing jumpswats and don't

858
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Gary and lunges and split squats and they were just trying to get that vertical jump off.

859
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
They were wearing, remember those shoes with like the little dead bull?

860
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I was on them.

861
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I just get them hops.

862
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
When you get them hops.

863
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
So, this guy had all those things.

864
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
And he only got to 32 inches, right?

865
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
And he was bummed.

866
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Yeah.

867
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
But that's what I'm saying.

868
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Yes.

869
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
He has a certain genetic.

870
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
A genetic capability.

871
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:40.000
There's physical capabilities that are genetic and there's some some mental capabilities that are genetic.

872
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
And both of them have a max capacity.

873
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:50.000
And that dude with the toe shoes for vertical jump improvement that warm all some.

874
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
There was a kid one time.

875
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
He lived across the street for me.

876
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
And he was young.

877
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
This is when I was probably 25.

878
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
I was in the gym back in the day.

879
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
But this kid trained all summer long with those shoes.

880
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
He was, he wanted to do his dunk a basketball.

881
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Yeah.

882
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
And he did it eventually.

883
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
But he worked hard.

884
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
There are some people that don't even have to work hard.

885
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
They can dunk a basketball.

886
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
They just got it.

887
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Yeah, man.

888
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
My friend Kate Knott, who I mentioned.

889
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Can Kate Knott's dunk?

890
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
No.

891
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
We're talking about some different attribute.

892
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Now he always had like kind of like big, it's called big muscle bellies like the party or muscle.

893
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Anyway, he had kind of big muscle chin and it gives a thinner guy.

894
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
But and he was always cut.

895
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
So even into adulthood, he wouldn't have to watch his diet.

896
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Me and while if you're like a normal person, if you watch your diet like a lot, then you can get that cut.

897
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
You can get there.

898
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Oh yeah, totally can.

899
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
But Kate Knott's just cruising.

900
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
He's just cut shred abs.

901
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
And then he like lifts a bunch of weights over the summer.

902
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
What's work on I gave him by the way.

903
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
And he glistled by, he comes back and he's just huge.

904
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
But anyway, so it's like dang.

905
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
But you know, he just has it like that.

906
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
There you go.

907
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Genetic, genetic differences.

908
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
And that's what they're talking about in this book.

909
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:11.000
And I think sometimes people's attitude nowadays is like, well, you know, you can do whatever you want.

910
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Well, to know actually you should find out what's good for you.

911
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Yeah.

912
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
That's a digital look for me.

913
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Like I was a radio man.

914
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
You know, it was like radio man.

915
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Why?

916
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Because I was like smart, but I was big enough to carry a radio.

917
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Right?

918
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
The small guys in the sea of the tune, they become the point man.

919
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Because you don't have to carry an extra weight, generally.

920
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
So you're so right.

921
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.000
And consider like major industries and we'll just say sports, right?

922
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Where it's like, it's pretty clear when you win, you win when you lose you lose sports, right?

923
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
So get the established sports.

924
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
With very, very few exceptions is going to be the case.

925
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
You're going to get like, okay, football.

926
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Because there's a bunch of positions that do very different things.

927
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
The tight end, he's going to be a certain bill, generally.

928
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
For sure.

929
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
The quarterback, he's going to be a certain bill and receive or he's going to be a certain

930
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Build, the center and the line, certain builds.

931
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Like you grab a guy from a line guard, right?

932
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000
One of the guys in the line, you put him on defense as like a cornerback or something.

933
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Who needs literally opposite after you know what you do that to it happened.

934
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
So oh, no, no, no, just train them.

935
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Train them for 10 years.

936
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
No, no, negative.

937
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Probably make him better, but you make him successful.

938
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Exactly.

939
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Right?

940
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
So it's like it's such a clear example.

941
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Because there's more on the line with that, you know.

942
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:30.000
So if you're a youngster, you should look at your attributes and see number one where your attributes fit and then what your interests are.

943
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Sometimes people get their super interested and so they just try for it anyways.

944
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Yeah.

945
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
And that's cool.

946
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Yeah.

947
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
That's cool.

948
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:46.000
There's some people that would get really good at a sport, but there's still not good enough to go pro because they don't have the genetic.

949
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Yeah.

950
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
And gifts that are needed.

951
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Yeah.

952
01:05:50.000 --> 01:06:00.000
And that's why it's so prevalent and such a like big deal when you do find the like the super rare guy where it's like, hey, he's not really genetically gifted, but he works so hard.

953
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
That he made it to the pro.

954
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Yeah.

955
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And typically that's like a guy in basketball who's like not tall, not fast.

956
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Yeah.

957
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
You know, like the knocks and the knocks.

958
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Yeah, but he was a pretty fast though.

959
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And he could jump.

960
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Well, well, but he's small.

961
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Yes.

962
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000
And the thing was talking to Dallas who's the coach of the goals, the same thing.

963
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
The goals, the team.

964
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Yeah.

965
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
But a few years ago, not very long.

966
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:33.000
The hockey had become all these big giant guys, you know, six, four, six, five, two hundred and sixty pounds.

967
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
He's big monster guys.

968
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
And that's where everyone had started going in that direction.

969
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
All the teams are getting bigger because you guys are massive.

970
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
They can hit hard.

971
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000
And then recently it started going back again to guys that were smaller and quicker and could be a big monster guy.

972
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
And could move faster.

973
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
So that's an interesting evolution.

974
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Yeah.

975
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
But you can look at it.

976
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
You could have looked at it four years ago or whatever it was.

977
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
I don't really know.

978
01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:02.000
But 10 years ago, whatever, when if you were five, eleven, you're like, man, I'm not big enough to play pro hockey.

979
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
But some kids were like, you know what, I'm five, eleven would be fast.

980
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I mean, faster and everyone.

981
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Okay.

982
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Cool.

983
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
And they made it.

984
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
And now they're in the game.

985
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Yeah, make sense.

986
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Yeah, I'm not as familiar with like the necessities of being a good hockey.

987
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Player or team as far as a physical attributes.

988
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:25.000
But like football used that big, that example because the jobs of each position are so different.

989
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I meant not each position, but like the differences between, you know, like a cornerback,

990
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
why do you see we're in the difference between that and like a line man.

991
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
So yeah, that's what it's gonna be.

992
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Yeah.

993
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
So like basketball is different.

994
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Even though they have different positions where everyone has sword at,

995
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
I'm generally speaking, of course, this exception.

996
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
But everyone's gonna be tall.

997
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
No one's gonna be slow.

998
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
If you're like slow, it's like that's a big kind of deal.

999
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
You know, everyone's a little bit more uniform.

1000
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Yeah, hockey seems the same way.

1001
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Yeah, more uniform, hockey is more uniform.

1002
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Seal puttune is not uniform.

1003
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Yeah.

1004
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Because you got a big 60 gunner.

1005
01:07:59.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Yeah.

1006
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
And a peg gunner.

1007
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Yeah, makes sense.

1008
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
But you know what, not all peg gunners are big.

1009
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Yeah.

1010
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Because you can just be a tough.

1011
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
162 pound peg gunner.

1012
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Just can't go.

1013
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Just can grind it out.

1014
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Point man's usually a little bit smaller.

1015
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
But that's, but when you get to a seal team, guys look at you.

1016
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000
You're like, oh, you're, you're five seven, you're 140 pounds.

1017
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
You're gonna be a point man.

1018
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
That's the way to work.

1019
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Yeah.

1020
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Most of the time, sometimes you get a puttune and then like we already got a point man dude.

1021
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
You're gonna carry a peg.

1022
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Here you go.

1023
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Buck up and start doing some squats.

1024
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Boy.

1025
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
All right.

1026
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Personality.

1027
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
It takes more than brains to make a good soldier.

1028
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
It takes guts.

1029
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
It takes endurance.

1030
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
It takes a willingness to do hard to work.

1031
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000
It takes a keen interest in doing the job well.

1032
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Psychologists wish they could give the army right now a method of measuring these important

1033
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Pack personality assets.

1034
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Test that would be as accurate and reliable as a test for measuring the ability to do arithmetic

1035
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
or aptitude for learning radio code.

1036
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
They can't.

1037
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Some tests have been tried.

1038
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Many have been found useless few are promising.

1039
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
You know what's interesting?

1040
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I just thought of this.

1041
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
I went to communication school.

1042
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
The the seal communication school.

1043
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
And we had to learn Morris code.

1044
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:29.000
And there was probably 20 guys in my comms course.

1045
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
And we all had to learn Morris code.

1046
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
And this was very clear that some people were better at it than others.

1047
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Because you had to and we didn't have to send very fast.

1048
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
But we had to be able to receive like a certain amount of groups.

1049
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
It's called a group.

1050
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
It's five.

1051
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Five letters in a group.

1052
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000
And they would just come at you.

1053
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Yeah.

1054
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.000
And you had to be able to receive and write down what the letters were with no mistakes.

1055
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
But what's interesting is we all showed up no new anymore code when we showed up.

1056
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
And there was a complete bell curve when we got done.

1057
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
You know, some guys were really good at it naturally.

1058
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:11.000
And it took every ounce of mental power for them to figure out and get to be able to pass the test.

1059
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
And I had a crazy guy that was teaching the comm school.

1060
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:20.000
And someone would be like, hey, chief, why do we have to learn Morris code since no one uses it.

1061
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And he said, you know, in the event of a nuclear holocaust, Morris code is the only thing that's going to be punched through the ionosphere.

1062
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000
And of course, I was 18 years old and I was like, oh, dude, that's right.

1063
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Right.

1064
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Right.

1065
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I was, you know, my interest was peaked.

1066
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I was like, hey, in the event of a nuclear holocaust, I'm going to be on the HF radio hammer

1067
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
and out Morris code to the troops.

1068
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Let them know what's up.

1069
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
That makes sense.

1070
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Dude, but I was.

1071
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
What do you mean?

1072
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
So what?

1073
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
You don't agree with that?

1074
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Dude, if there's a nuclear holocaust, I wouldn't be alive.

1075
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Well, what if it would be dead.

1076
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
But you know, what if you're like one of the only shrubs or if you're right.

1077
01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
So if I was like me.

1078
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
But it's so, man, that's interesting.

1079
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000
That where you'd have to, I mean, that small little thing that you just had where you have to,

1080
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
it's less about putting it out of it's more about receiving.

1081
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Because Morris code, you don't communicate necessarily.

1082
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000
No, you just got to use it.

1083
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Here's the reason.

1084
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Here's the reason behind it.

1085
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
If you want to send Morris code, you can send it with your money.

1086
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
You can't.

1087
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Because the people are just going to sit there and take the letters that you're sending.

1088
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Right?

1089
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
They're not saying hurry up.

1090
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Right.

1091
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
So you can send it whatever pace you want.

1092
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
But receiving, you got to be ready.

1093
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
And I figured you would have to send it to them.

1094
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I think what I want to say was 20 groups of men.

1095
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000
And there's something like that.

1096
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
What's the path?

1097
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
You mean like not passing it.

1098
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
I forget I forget.

1099
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
But we weren't as good as a regular Navy guy who would just be,

1100
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
I don't even know what, but they way faster.

1101
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
We were like knuckle draggers compared to that.

1102
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
They're like a leg.

1103
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
We had to learn every day.

1104
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
And you had to do it every day until you tested out.

1105
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
And some people tested out in a few weeks.

1106
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Some people didn't test out until the last days.

1107
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Sit there, do more.

1108
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
You just code.

1109
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Do you still know more, Scott?

1110
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Not really.

1111
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
What if it came in it like,

1112
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
B.

1113
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
I would need to brush up on it.

1114
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
No, I need to brush up on it.

1115
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000
And which I need to do because if there is a new get a hall cost.

1116
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I want to be ready to get comms out.

1117
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
HF comms.

1118
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Yeah, every single, of course.

1119
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Yeah.

1120
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Check.

1121
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
But it's such a clear example of.

1122
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:25.000
And the guys, it wasn't like on that bell curve of guys that were good and bad.

1123
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.000
I'm like, everyone that was a good seal was up at the top.

1124
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
And the guys that weren't good at Morris Code were bad.

1125
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Seals know it was like some of the guys were awesome guys.

1126
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
And they sucked it Morris Code.

1127
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Yeah.

1128
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
And some guys were marginal guys, but they were a great Morris Code.

1129
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Yeah.

1130
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
And there's a perfect example.

1131
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Like, what do you do with that guy?

1132
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I don't put him in a make him a radio man.

1133
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Yeah.

1134
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
That's interesting.

1135
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Yeah, he had kicked that.

1136
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
When he was going through, I think this,

1137
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
but no, no, it was after.

1138
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
He kept saying, like, man, actually my other friend Jeremy was telling me that,

1139
01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
oh, yeah, he's good at, like, pretty much everything.

1140
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Yeah.

1141
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
He's just really good at stuff except for picking locks.

1142
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Yeah.

1143
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
He was like struggling with like, he could go locks,

1144
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
which was kind of a random thing to struggle with.

1145
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Pick and locks is a difficult thing.

1146
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:21.000
And it's a, it's more like playing a musical instrument that it is like doing a technical skill where you do ABC and you get D.

1147
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
No, picking locks is like you got a little art man.

1148
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
You got a few for it.

1149
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
And I've been with guys.

1150
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I was okay at picking locks.

1151
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:35.000
The guy that I learned from was he could walk up and put the, you know,

1152
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:41.000
walk up to a door knob and stand, not facing it and just stand there and just pick the lock open in seconds.

1153
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
It's pretty incredible.

1154
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Kind of like on that movie, the Italian job.

1155
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
You ever watched that?

1156
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:46.000
No.

1157
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Yeah, it's a good one.

1158
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
So this girl she was like the safe cracker.

1159
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
You know, they're like a den of thieves.

1160
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000
They're this group of thieves.

1161
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
So she was the safe cracker.

1162
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Guess what her dad was.

1163
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
That's a lot of safe cracker.

1164
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
You know, so it was like a genetic thing.

1165
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
They're good.

1166
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
You know, so the dad passed it on to the, you know, it's like genetics.

1167
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Some people that's how, you know?

1168
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Yeah.

1169
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Maybe it's a learned behavior as well that she learned from the old man.

1170
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:11.000
All right.

1171
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Going on back to the book.

1172
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
One trouble is that a man's person, this is important.

1173
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.000
One trouble is that a man's personality changes in different situations.

1174
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:25.000
For instance, the man who's brave is a lion in the test room at a reception center.

1175
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
May not be so brave when he gets into combat.

1176
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.000
The man who is able to make quick decisions wisely when things are quiet may go to pieces

1177
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000
when he is distracted by machine gunfire and do something that result in his own death or the death of others.

1178
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
And difficult situations may have the reverse effects on some men.

1179
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Men who have never distinguished themselves in training camp may become fired with new spirit

1180
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.000
when the going gets tough, astounding themselves and other men with what they can do in extreme emergency.

1181
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
So that's obviously important too.

1182
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
So even though you know someone, you don't even know him.

1183
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
You know what you're going to get.

1184
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
You might have something that freaks out when things go sideways.

1185
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Next section, training makes the soldier.

1186
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:15.000
When men enter the army, they are told the importance in the fighting areas of taking cover from enemy fire in sling.

1187
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:21.000
And when men be fired in slit trenches, this point is emphasized in books, lectures, training films, demonstrations and exhibits.

1188
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:27.000
By the time the soldier reaches the battles on his own, he is learned that he should take cover in a slit trench whenever he stops.

1189
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
That is one kind of learning.

1190
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
In one way, it is the most useful kind.

1191
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000
With knowledge of how things should be done and why they are important,

1192
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
a soldier is equipped to act in new situations.

1193
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
And there is nothing that produces so many new situations as combat.

1194
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.000
But this kind of learning, unfortunately, does not always result in action.

1195
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.000
A soldier may know perfectly well that he should dig a trench.

1196
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.000
He may have learned it from demonstrations exactly how to go digging it.

1197
01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Yet when the enemy planes come overhead, he may in his excitement, forget that what he was learned.

1198
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000
In such emergencies, he is more likely to act from habit than from reasoning.

1199
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:14.000
And since habit formation is a further stage of learning, it depends on practice experience and repetition.

1200
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:22.000
No action ever becomes automatic by learning in words, how to perform it, but without actually practicing it.

1201
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:31.000
But by repetition, the operation of a machine or a rifle gets itself reduced to habits so that it becomes almost entirely mechanical like walking.

1202
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.000
You do not have to think about putting your left foot forward after planning your right foot ahead.

1203
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
That is because you have walked so much.

1204
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:44.000
You could not get that way merely from listening to lectures on how to walk.

1205
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
If during maneuvers, a soldier practices taking cover instantly,

1206
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
whenever he sees your hears an erratack warning or plane coming close,

1207
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:59.000
if he always throws himself flat when he first hears the sudden whistle of a shell or the singing of bullets passes ears,

1208
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
these actions soon become second-major to him.

1209
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:08.000
The particular warning sites and sounds become fixed as signals for immediate actions.

1210
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
In real emergency, the soldier does not have to stop and think about what he should do.

1211
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000
He just does it.

1212
01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Straight forward, that's why we roll in jujitsu.

1213
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.000
That's why you look drilling is important. I get it.

1214
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000
You got to learn the move, but you got to roll.

1215
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Yeah, and one could argue that drilling serves the same purpose just in a more specific way.

1216
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
It does.

1217
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
It does. You got to do both.

1218
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Yeah. Now, if you drill correctly, but what you can't do is sit there and get shown to move.

1219
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Right. You got to do the move.

1220
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Yeah.

1221
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
And I used to do that too when we'd have guys going through CQC training.

1222
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:50.000
And a lot of times, you know, instructor might want to hear himself talk a lot and explain things.

1223
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Because you know, it's a poem to the ego and you get up there and you show people what to do.

1224
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
What?

1225
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Which is how I did it.

1226
01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Burt and you're doing it like this.

1227
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:06.000
So, you know, you get instructor that wants to hear himself talk and meanwhile, they sit there and talk for 20 minutes.

1228
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000
The seal puttune could done three more runs through the kill house in 20 minutes.

1229
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
So, I'll tell you what.

1230
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Say what you got to say. Say it quick and let the boys go pull that trigger because that's how we get good by doing.

1231
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Back to the book, this sort of learning of minor importance in high school or college is basic in the army.

1232
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.000
That is why drill is so important. Why discipline is so essential.

1233
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.000
In war games, the soldier gets conditioned to all sights and sounds of battle in early training.

1234
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.000
It may be possible to simulate realistically the noises of shells, dive bombers,

1235
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000
and bursting bombs by recordings reproduced by loud speakers.

1236
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:49.000
In advance training, a soldier may be taught to lie flat on the ground while real bullets strike within a few feet.

1237
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:55.000
If the cause sand to fall on the back of his neck, he knows he is safe as so long as he lies still,

1238
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
but if you get up and run, he will be killed.

1239
01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
That is good training for combat.

1240
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:05.000
A real bullet forms much better habits than a lecture about a bullet.

1241
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Such thoroughly drilled habits enable the soldier to act when there is no time for fought.

1242
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:19.000
They ensure that he will act correctly and mechanically even as mine is confused and thinking is almost impossible.

1243
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:25.000
But knowledge of the science of warfare and practice in solving novel military problems are important too,

1244
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:32.000
because they enable the soldier to act wisely in the thousands of unexpected emergencies that arise in battle.

1245
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Habit is safer than fought for standardized acts, but it won't work for brand new problems.

1246
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.000
That is why we would train our guys in brand new problems all the time.

1247
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000
That way you get a protocol for how to handle brand new problems.

1248
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
You start to understand what you are going to do.

1249
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
I don't know what is happening.

1250
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
What I am going to be going to be a step back.

1251
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I am going to look around.

1252
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
I am going to set a situation.

1253
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I am going to come up with some possible solutions.

1254
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
I am going to think about what the outcomes and solutions are, what the risks are,

1255
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.000
and make a decision we are going to move forward in that direction.

1256
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Because like,

1257
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:13.000
confronting or dealing with new problems or uncharted situations or whatever,

1258
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000
the skill of dealing with that is like another skill in and of itself.

1259
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
You think you are saying this like last time.

1260
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Yeah.

1261
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Protocol.

1262
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
People are asking about protocol.

1263
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Protocol for handling new problems.

1264
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.000
And eventually you get good at it.

1265
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Obviously, obviously the first thing is you do is you detach.

1266
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000
You have to take a step back.

1267
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
You have to turn around and look around.

1268
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Physically look around.

1269
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
So detach.

1270
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Look around.

1271
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Making assessment come up with possible solutions.

1272
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Think about what the outcomes of those solutions might be.

1273
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
And then pick the one that has the best possible outcome.

1274
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Pretty different than like.

1275
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Trained level 10 training.

1276
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Yeah.

1277
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Perfect training on situation ABCDEFGH.

1278
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
JKLMLP.

1279
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Yeah.

1280
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
And cue.

1281
01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Because you're going to get hit with Z.

1282
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Yeah.

1283
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000
When Z hits, it's like dang.

1284
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Can you then you've totally shut up?

1285
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
I just got a message from a guy that was in a police officer.

1286
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000
It was in a big firefight with some of his guys.

1287
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
And he was literally said,

1288
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
I was like thinking to myself, I'll get cover move.

1289
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Here's what we're going to do.

1290
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Prioritize next to you.

1291
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000
He was going through.

1292
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
He's like, there was pretty awesome.

1293
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Pretty awesome.

1294
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
To hear a guy say, yep.

1295
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
I can hear your voice saying cover move.

1296
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Put down color fire right now.

1297
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Yeah.

1298
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
When it's going down.

1299
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Yeah.

1300
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000
When it's going down.

1301
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000
They were in a 21 minute firefight.

1302
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000
It's a long, long.

1303
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
That's a long firefight for especially for police officers.

1304
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Back to the book.

1305
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Drill for combat changes the recruit squad into an efficient fighting machine.

1306
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Training can convert an unorganized civilian group into an organized unit with deadly power.

1307
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Military confidence,

1308
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:54.000
moral versus strips of war of its most repulsive and paralyzing horrors.

1309
01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:02.000
And knowledge takes from the enemy his most potent and effective weapon, surprise.

1310
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Drill combat training practice and discipline combined with the experience and war are things that make America's combat troops into seasoned troops.

1311
01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000
So even taking away the ability for the enemy to surprise you.

1312
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.000
It's like we talked about before.

1313
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:24.000
If you try and move on the NGJ2 and you have never seen it before, there's a chance it's going to work.

1314
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
There's the best possible chance it's going to work.

1315
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
As soon as I know what that move is,

1316
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.000
I mean, then it's the chances of it working are a lot less.

1317
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
A lot less.

1318
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Significantly less.

1319
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Yeah.

1320
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Yeah.

1321
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000
That's why roleplaying is so important.

1322
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Well, in the business world, it's very important because we can come out to you with different things.

1323
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000
That is a subordinate.

1324
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
It's going to save you.

1325
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Yeah.

1326
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Or even up the chain of command.

1327
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
If I had to go brief my boss on something that we were pretty sure he didn't like.

1328
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
And I was like, okay, I go you be the boss.

1329
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
You come at me with all the negatives about the plan I've come up with.

1330
01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000
And then we do that.

1331
01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
So then I go in.

1332
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000
I've already seen these.

1333
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
See the series though.

1334
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Yeah.

1335
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Even one time makes an incredible difference.

1336
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Back to the book and we need speed.

1337
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Democracy is always after hurry up at the last minute.

1338
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000
The enemy is always facing us.

1339
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Ready trained and there isn't much time.

1340
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.000
We must take advantage of every possible shortcut toward the goal of creating seasoned troops.

1341
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Troops armed with etiquette at equetraining.

1342
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.000
The first shortcut is an understanding of the few facts about how learning takes place.

1343
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
The most important requirement of learning is incentive.

1344
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Men marching to drill reluctantly can know more be taught swiftly and efficiently than a Jeep can be taught to run on.

1345
01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
And then we need to be taught to run on an empty tank.

1346
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
People need incentive.

1347
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:54.000
But fortunately for the army's instructors, there is a powerful motive for furnished by the situation itself.

1348
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000
No false incentives need be thought up and provided.

1349
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
The enemy has attacked us.

1350
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
We are at war and no man wants to go out and face the that enemy unprepared.

1351
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:09.000
No American wants to see American soldiers killed needlessly in unmatched battle.

1352
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:17.000
No one wants to see our armies defeated and the Gestapo policing New York City.

1353
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Success itself is a reward to the soldier.

1354
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
It makes him proud.

1355
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.000
This is when they start, I forgot to say that I'm skipping chunks of this book.

1356
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.000
But this is where he's talking about how the incentives that a soldier can have.

1357
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:38.000
His commander may commend him, but it's usually enough if he sees that a seal has noticed that he has done a good job.

1358
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Good morale depends on such rewards.

1359
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
A pro.

1360
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:50.000
A such awards by his officers and approval from his own comrades.

1361
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:57.000
In general, reward is much more effective for learning than is punishment.

1362
01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
This is good.

1363
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Punishment excites resentment and tends to make the soldier anxious not to comply if he can get away with careless and

1364
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
discerpt disobedience.

1365
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.000
If you can remember that right there, this podcast is worthwhile.

1366
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:19.000
If you remember the fact that as a leader, if you're constantly punishing people, what you're doing is it making them resentful,

1367
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:28.000
encouraging them to not comply and rebel against you and trying to get away with careless and disobediates.

1368
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Think about your kids do.

1369
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Because we do that with the kids, you're better to what I told you.

1370
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
They try to try to escape around you.

1371
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
The reward keeps his attention on the business and hand.

1372
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Punishment tends to shift his attention from the task to his own troubles.

1373
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:51.000
The best kind of reward because it is most effective in learning is the glow of satisfaction that a man has when he knows he has done something correctly and well.

1374
01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000
It is clicked.

1375
01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:02.000
The most effective punishment is the surge of disgust that comes when he knows he's missed the target.

1376
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:10.000
That sounds always good to have a reminder because it's natural to like, I mean with your kids or whatever,

1377
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:15.000
when they do something wrong, because that'll stick out more in your mind.

1378
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
They do something right, especially if it's not for the first time.

1379
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.000
It's like, oh yeah, that's how you're supposed to do it.

1380
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Right, kind of think so to stick out as much in your mind to commend them.

1381
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Yeah, like encourage me to reward kind of thing.

1382
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000
It's more powerful, but then in your mind as kind of the teacher or whatever,

1383
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:40.000
when they fail to miss the mark, especially if they do it like if they're having a hard time with something.

1384
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:46.000
You know, like to learn stuff you gotta do it over and say, they're having a hard time out of no swimming, potty, train, or whatever.

1385
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.000
When they don't miss the mark yet, so it comes with frustration sometimes.

1386
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Can't show that kind of thing, but even though it's like the most readily available reaction,

1387
01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.000
you know, the one they fail. So yeah, to be reminded of it helps, I think.

1388
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Yeah, it's an important point.

1389
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Next, this is why the Army has to, has been right to reduce greatly the emphasis on close order drill in recent years.

1390
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:22.000
In the light of modern knowledge and in the view of modern conditions of warfare, this drill conflicts with the methods which must be used in battle.

1391
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:30.000
So close energy drill is our close order drill is when you know you see the Marines army, they're like handing the rifle back real enforce and everything's all.

1392
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.000
It's like parade type stuff. That's our close order drill is, and they do more of it.

1393
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Now he's saying that they do less back to the book in the drill of the early basic training.

1394
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:44.000
The whole emphasis on teaching is on teaching the soldier to respond to spoken commands.

1395
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:53.000
When he yet when he goes into combat, spoken, spoken commands become impossible. The human voice is silent in the din of battle.

1396
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:59.000
If commands are given it all, there must be given in the form of a nudge, a kick or an arm and hand signal.

1397
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.000
And in drill, the soldier also forms the habit of acting children to shoulder with other men.

1398
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:09.000
He comes to rely on being in a group on doing what the other men do when they do it.

1399
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Yet in combat, such close order work would be suicidal.

1400
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Men are on their own. Men are then on their own or in twos or threes.

1401
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:28.000
They must keep at a distance from each other, both to do much of their fighting skillfully and to avoid making crowded targets for the enemies, bombs, shells or bullets.

1402
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:35.000
This means that in advance training, men must learn new habits which conflict some respects of the old.

1403
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:41.000
That's not good. The basic rule of learning is this, do it right from the beginning.

1404
01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Because if you form wrong habits, you must unlearn them before you can learn what is right.

1405
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:59.000
The rule to follow is never prepared for combat by learning to act on a signal that cannot be given after combat has started.

1406
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000
And then it talks about how to increase the speed of training.

1407
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Here's some things to do to increase the speed of training.

1408
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Number one, do things right the first time.

1409
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Number two, keep constant checks that you know immediately whether you are doing right or making a mistake.

1410
01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
That's a good one. That's why I like shooting steel so much.

1411
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
If you were shot steel before, no.

1412
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000
As soon as you pull the trigger and the shot goes, you know if you hit it or not.

1413
01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And so it's completely gratifying.

1414
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Make no unnecessary motions.

1415
01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:36.000
If you flourish your hands or putter around with your tools, like it or not, these profitless motions will become habit too.

1416
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
So when do everything as clean as you can?

1417
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Do things in the same order and in the same way stick to this rule as far as possible.

1418
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Avoid unnecessary lead links in the chains of your learning.

1419
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:56.000
This was interesting and I'm not going to read it because it went on about learning Morris Code.

1420
01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:01.000
And how you can put these multiple different steps in to learn it.

1421
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
In fact, you could just say that noise means this letter.

1422
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:09.000
You don't have to translate it to the little things in your mind or the sounds in your mind.

1423
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:14.000
The dot dash dash dash or you don't need to translate that in your mind.

1424
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000
That sound means this letter and you can get there quickly.

1425
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Like a language really.

1426
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1427
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000
When you're fluent in a language, you don't think in English anymore.

1428
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000
A little bit of a thing.

1429
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Yes.

1430
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
I don't I rarely go.

1431
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Maybe gotten to that a little with a few parts of espantial when I was in college,

1432
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:42.000
but I never carried on a conversation without translating when I was hearing, which is completely lame.

1433
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1434
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
It's a clunky for sure.

1435
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Yeah.

1436
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
But you know, that's part of the process of it.

1437
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Yeah.

1438
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Yeah.

1439
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Number six, aim at first first smoothness of performance rather than speed.

1440
01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Number seven.

1441
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Be sure to understand what you are trying to do.

1442
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000
What final objective you're aiming at.

1443
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
That's important.

1444
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.000
People should really, whoever you're training needs to understand what they're trying to do.

1445
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I found this in early jujitsu.

1446
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
There was a lot of lacking in this.

1447
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Where you didn't understand that getting the underhooks was a thing.

1448
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
You just understood it.

1449
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Like for this particular move, you put your arm here.

1450
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
I didn't understand it was a whole thing.

1451
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000
What would it matter be like, hey, you're always looking for the underhooks?

1452
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Yeah.

1453
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Make sense.

1454
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
That's actually what Dean taught me.

1455
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.000
He is the one to taught me that too.

1456
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000
And this is when he was a blue belt.

1457
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Yeah.

1458
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Number eight, learn series of actions rather than single moves.

1459
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
That's good for jujitsu as well.

1460
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
You don't just want to learn a one.

1461
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000
You want to learn how all those three four five moves tied together.

1462
01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:59.000
And how you set up the counters and how the counter leads to another trap.

1463
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Nine, keep on practicing.

1464
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Ten overlearn.

1465
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Number eleven, relax.

1466
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Interestingly enough, till people to relax and relax, harder.

1467
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Back to the book, ways have been worked out to help cut down the time required to master a subject to reading, understand a book or assignment to solve a problem or to memorize a rule or formula.

1468
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000
The man in the army, this is about studying.

1469
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000
And I was like, I don't know if I'm going to put this in there.

1470
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000
But then all you know, people are students.

1471
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
We would have a new job.

1472
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:44.000
And I learned something and this is the most cold, blooded way to talk about learning.

1473
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:50.000
The man in the army should not allow noise or other distractions or interrupts it to put him off his work.

1474
01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Working under such difficult circumstances is direct training for actual fighting conditions.

1475
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Also there's some annoying things going on when you're trying to read a book.

1476
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Cool.

1477
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Learn to ignore them.

1478
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:08.68
In the field, the most, in the field, the most vital and difficult decisions must be made in the midst of the most violent

1479
01:33:08.68 --> 01:33:12.68
distractions and under all sorts of physical and mental strains.

1480
01:33:12.68 --> 01:33:20.68
The officer had to wait until he could be free of noise or disturbance before he could work out a problem or make a decision would be useless in the army.

1481
01:33:20.68 --> 01:33:27.68
If he's used to it, a certain amount of noise and confusion may actually stimulate the army man to do better thinking.

1482
01:33:27.68 --> 01:33:31.68
If it's convenient, a definite time of the day should be assigned.

1483
01:33:31.68 --> 01:33:34.68
For studying the mind can be trained to be ready for work in a certain hour.

1484
01:33:34.68 --> 01:33:40.68
It happens as much the same way as you begin without being thinking about food or some other set time.

1485
01:33:40.68 --> 01:33:48.68
For the same reason it might be desirable to have a certain place set aside for study even if it is just your bunk in a noisy barracks or tent.

1486
01:33:48.68 --> 01:33:52.68
Then the act of sitting down in that place will immediately form habit.

1487
01:33:52.68 --> 01:33:56.68
Put you in the proper frame of mind for mental work.

1488
01:33:56.68 --> 01:34:03.68
If you are lucky enough to have a desk or a corner for your study, don't spoil its value by using it for relaxation or a no-fing.

1489
01:34:03.68 --> 01:34:17.68
But even if they are insistently disturbing, insistently disturbing is nearly always possible to ignore distractions and get down to the business at hand.

1490
01:34:17.68 --> 01:34:19.68
The mind is an excellent, sieve net.

1491
01:34:19.68 --> 01:34:22.68
You can read the newspapers and never see the advertisements.

1492
01:34:22.68 --> 01:34:29.68
You would hear a strange footsteps across the room yet never noticed the loud ticking of a clock on your own table.

1493
01:34:29.68 --> 01:34:40.68
The telegraph can sleep through the long continuous sounding of his instrument yet wake it once his own call when his own call comes in with the right dots and dashes.

1494
01:34:40.68 --> 01:34:50.68
In the same way it is possible to make yourself deaf and blind to all sorts of sights and sounds except those directly concerned with the problem being studied.

1495
01:34:50.68 --> 01:34:55.68
Do you get annoyed when you are trying to do what? Do you listen to music when you are doing work?

1496
01:34:55.68 --> 01:34:56.68
Do you think the depends on the work?

1497
01:34:56.68 --> 01:34:57.68
Yes.

1498
01:34:57.68 --> 01:35:00.68
Interesting.

1499
01:35:00.68 --> 01:35:07.68
At first it is fatiguing to shut out distractions. You know what I am like? I was just asking it.

1500
01:35:07.68 --> 01:35:10.68
This is what I am like.

1501
01:35:10.68 --> 01:35:14.68
If I let something start to bother me then it just bothers me.

1502
01:35:14.68 --> 01:35:18.68
And for some reason if I just don't let it bother me then it's fine.

1503
01:35:18.68 --> 01:35:27.68
Like my wife is in the other room with my youngest daughter and they are playing a game and making noise and having conversations about it and whatever.

1504
01:35:27.68 --> 01:35:34.68
If I am in the wrong mind said if I don't do what this book is telling me to do it you just shut it out.

1505
01:35:34.68 --> 01:35:39.68
Like a legit dude is supposed to do all there is to know is it is whatever.

1506
01:35:39.68 --> 01:35:41.68
Just lock it up.

1507
01:35:41.68 --> 01:35:48.68
Otherwise it is what weakness is.

1508
01:35:48.68 --> 01:35:58.68
Like you know you heard like a roommate or what but you know you have a mutual friend that when we used to go to fights we would stay in one room and the story would be pretty crazy.

1509
01:35:58.68 --> 01:36:01.68
But I would normally sleep right through it.

1510
01:36:01.68 --> 01:36:11.68
If I know what is happening it is weird like my crying kids when they were babies they would wake up my wife and my wife and I would sleep right through it.

1511
01:36:11.68 --> 01:36:18.68
But if there is a noise outside the house or whatever I am awake and she is sure it is like the perfect combination.

1512
01:36:18.68 --> 01:36:23.68
I think the mother and the crying child I think that is a genetic thing.

1513
01:36:23.68 --> 01:36:30.68
I think we are like a crying baby like you know did you know that in the house of brocids?

1514
01:36:30.68 --> 01:36:33.68
Does that make sense?

1515
01:36:33.68 --> 01:36:34.68
Yes it does.

1516
01:36:34.68 --> 01:36:40.68
And is there part of me because you know when we had small children my wife didn't work I did.

1517
01:36:40.68 --> 01:36:44.68
So that was her roles and responsibilities.

1518
01:36:44.68 --> 01:36:52.68
My roles and responsibilities were go to do my job during the day and whenever I was in the Navy her roles and responsibilities were to take care of those kids.

1519
01:36:52.68 --> 01:37:01.68
So there is probably a huge part of that where I am maybe in the beginning when the first baby was crying and I was like oh what is that?

1520
01:37:01.68 --> 01:37:03.68
And then eventually I just said oh she has got it.

1521
01:37:03.68 --> 01:37:05.68
Yeah that makes sense.

1522
01:37:05.68 --> 01:37:08.68
Got it handled.

1523
01:37:08.68 --> 01:37:12.68
Going back to the book at first it is fatiguing to shut out distractions.

1524
01:37:12.68 --> 01:37:15.68
You actually make your muscles tense and you are effort to attend to business.

1525
01:37:15.68 --> 01:37:20.68
Later you get so that things that distract you no longer worry you.

1526
01:37:20.68 --> 01:37:23.68
No it's when I'm on an airplane you're around screaming baby on an airplane.

1527
01:37:23.68 --> 01:37:25.68
Yeah no factor to me.

1528
01:37:25.68 --> 01:37:27.68
It's like no factor whatsoever.

1529
01:37:27.68 --> 01:37:30.68
Yeah we talked about this while we were on there.

1530
01:37:30.68 --> 01:37:32.68
Okay you brought it up too.

1531
01:37:32.68 --> 01:37:34.68
I was like oh you're that screaming is that bothered me?

1532
01:37:34.68 --> 01:37:36.68
Yes that's bothered me at all.

1533
01:37:36.68 --> 01:37:44.68
Still later they help and find that you miss them if they disappear like the man who has startled when his clock stopped ticking or the radio.

1534
01:37:44.68 --> 01:37:50.68
At first it prevents you from studying but if you keep it on continuously you may get so you cannot study without it.

1535
01:37:50.68 --> 01:37:55.68
Having set the stage as well as possible for most effective study the next important preparation is to develop

1536
01:37:55.68 --> 01:37:58.68
absorbing interest in the material to be mastered.

1537
01:37:58.68 --> 01:38:02.68
It is not necessary to resort to self-delivered mental pep talks.

1538
01:38:02.68 --> 01:38:10.68
Enthusiasm grows naturally out of the realization that a study is important in reaching a desirable goal that it will satisfy your curiosity

1539
01:38:10.68 --> 01:38:14.68
and will give you a chance to exercise some special talent.

1540
01:38:14.68 --> 01:38:22.68
Isn't that funny how that could very well be a self pep talk that those words are actually true.

1541
01:38:22.68 --> 01:38:25.68
True.

1542
01:38:25.68 --> 01:38:39.68
The chief aid to learning however is understanding when something makes sense when it all fits in with what you already know that it is easily filed away in the ready reference system of your memory.

1543
01:38:39.68 --> 01:38:43.68
Where it can be recalled later at need.

1544
01:38:43.68 --> 01:38:45.68
Learning without understanding is hard.

1545
01:38:45.68 --> 01:38:49.68
You probably learned the multiplication tables that way.

1546
01:38:49.68 --> 01:38:53.68
Learning with understanding may require no effort at all.

1547
01:38:53.68 --> 01:38:57.68
So try to understand sea relationships.

1548
01:38:57.68 --> 01:39:01.68
If chapter 8 depends on chapter 2 then you are uncertain about chapter 2 turn back.

1549
01:39:01.68 --> 01:39:03.68
See the depends.

1550
01:39:03.68 --> 01:39:05.68
Work it out for yourself rather than read it again.

1551
01:39:05.68 --> 01:39:11.68
If you learn a new scientific fact, see whether you can find instances of it in your own experience.

1552
01:39:11.68 --> 01:39:18.68
And then when you think you know it, when you think you know what you have studied, say it all over to yourself in your own words.

1553
01:39:18.68 --> 01:39:20.68
That test understanding.

1554
01:39:20.68 --> 01:39:25.68
Sometimes it gets clear for the first time as you explain it to yourself.

1555
01:39:25.68 --> 01:39:33.68
And if you can't get it said to your own satisfaction, then chances are you really do not understand it.

1556
01:39:33.68 --> 01:39:35.68
And what you don't understand you won't remember.

1557
01:39:35.68 --> 01:39:42.68
That's good information right there for the students of the world which everyone should be.

1558
01:39:42.68 --> 01:39:44.68
This is other good information.

1559
01:39:44.68 --> 01:39:47.68
Solving problems.

1560
01:39:47.68 --> 01:39:53.68
The method of bird's eye view first applies to rapid problems solving as well.

1561
01:39:53.68 --> 01:40:01.68
Haste too often tempts people to plunge into working out the first part of a problem or the easy parts before the entire problem is clearly in mind.

1562
01:40:01.68 --> 01:40:04.68
This may result in a fall start and needless work.

1563
01:40:04.68 --> 01:40:07.68
Read the whole problem through first.

1564
01:40:07.68 --> 01:40:10.68
Use care and setting the problem down.

1565
01:40:10.68 --> 01:40:15.68
If you are new at this particular sort of problem, don't try to take shortcuts in this.

1566
01:40:15.68 --> 01:40:22.68
A little extra time used on formulating the problem in your mind or on paper can save a great deal of time in finding the solution.

1567
01:40:22.68 --> 01:40:28.68
The next step is to rapidly review all possible methods of solving the problem until you find the one that seems right.

1568
01:40:28.68 --> 01:40:31.68
Then try that. If that file fails to work, try another.

1569
01:40:31.68 --> 01:40:34.68
That's the way you work with a mechanical puzzle.

1570
01:40:34.68 --> 01:40:37.68
You should use the same method on the technical problem.

1571
01:40:37.68 --> 01:40:42.68
And this is the same exact thing that I was saying about how to solve a complex tactical scenario.

1572
01:40:42.68 --> 01:40:44.68
You take a step back. You look at what the problem is.

1573
01:40:44.68 --> 01:40:46.68
You make sure you understand the whole problem.

1574
01:40:46.68 --> 01:40:48.68
You just don't say, oh, we're getting shot out from over there.

1575
01:40:48.68 --> 01:40:50.68
We're going to change everything in focus on them because you're getting flanked.

1576
01:40:50.68 --> 01:40:51.68
Yeah.

1577
01:40:51.68 --> 01:40:53.68
Or you're getting some recon by fire over there.

1578
01:40:53.68 --> 01:40:59.68
So you take a step back. You analyze the situation. You make sure you've understood it to the best of your possibility.

1579
01:40:59.68 --> 01:41:02.68
And then you start saying, okay, what are my options?

1580
01:41:02.68 --> 01:41:07.68
Once you figure out what your options are, you quickly assess what with the results of those options be.

1581
01:41:07.68 --> 01:41:11.68
What's the upside, what's the downside and then you pick one of them you go?

1582
01:41:11.68 --> 01:41:20.68
It's so funny that exact thing, not as complex, but that exact thing played itself out in my life very recently.

1583
01:41:20.68 --> 01:41:23.68
So I got a trampoline, right? You know, those big ones.

1584
01:41:23.68 --> 01:41:24.68
They're your kids.

1585
01:41:24.68 --> 01:41:25.68
And you got to put it together.

1586
01:41:25.68 --> 01:41:26.68
Yeah.

1587
01:41:26.68 --> 01:41:28.68
And then look at the whole structure.

1588
01:41:28.68 --> 01:41:31.68
Well, I do this thing where that they said I forget how they know it.

1589
01:41:31.68 --> 01:41:33.68
Said it the words they'd be using the book right there.

1590
01:41:33.68 --> 01:41:36.68
They you just said, but basically I looked at it.

1591
01:41:36.68 --> 01:41:37.68
I didn't understand the whole thing.

1592
01:41:37.68 --> 01:41:38.68
I didn't read the whole answer.

1593
01:41:38.68 --> 01:41:39.68
I don't know.

1594
01:41:39.68 --> 01:41:40.68
I looked at it. I was like, oh, I understand.

1595
01:41:40.68 --> 01:41:42.68
You know, I see the problem I'm dealing with here.

1596
01:41:42.68 --> 01:41:45.68
So I did it and how that worked out for it.

1597
01:41:45.68 --> 01:41:47.68
It broke three separate times.

1598
01:41:47.68 --> 01:41:50.68
I went, you know how like at a certain point you got to make sure you got to do something.

1599
01:41:50.68 --> 01:41:51.68
It's like that kind.

1600
01:41:51.68 --> 01:41:55.68
So I did make sure that the springs were aligned, you know, certain way.

1601
01:41:55.68 --> 01:41:57.68
For a reason that's going to come up late.

1602
01:41:57.68 --> 01:41:58.68
Yeah, that's right.

1603
01:41:58.68 --> 01:42:00.68
So I'm like, I get it.

1604
01:42:00.68 --> 01:42:01.68
I'm smart.

1605
01:42:01.68 --> 01:42:04.68
I've put on all this through the whole thing.

1606
01:42:04.68 --> 01:42:06.68
Everything took like an hour,

1607
01:42:06.68 --> 01:42:07.68
and we'll just over an hour to do it.

1608
01:42:07.68 --> 01:42:09.68
So I keep going, keep going.

1609
01:42:09.68 --> 01:42:09.68
Keep going.

1610
01:42:09.68 --> 01:42:13.68
Now it's time to put up like the, you know, the little barriers.

1611
01:42:13.68 --> 01:42:14.68
Yeah.

1612
01:42:14.68 --> 01:42:16.68
Kids don't fly out there, trampoline.

1613
01:42:16.68 --> 01:42:19.68
But the springs, or the springs are not aligned with hooks there.

1614
01:42:19.68 --> 01:42:21.68
So I can't put up the barriers.

1615
01:42:21.68 --> 01:42:22.68
Yeah, it's bummer isn't it?

1616
01:42:22.68 --> 01:42:23.68
It's a freaking bummer.

1617
01:42:23.68 --> 01:42:24.68
Yeah.

1618
01:42:24.68 --> 01:42:26.68
And it happened again with another thing later.

1619
01:42:26.68 --> 01:42:29.68
Actually, having four times, but the fourth thing was just the little basketball hoop.

1620
01:42:29.68 --> 01:42:31.68
And I was like, it's not worth it.

1621
01:42:31.68 --> 01:42:32.68
Yeah.

1622
01:42:32.68 --> 01:42:33.68
So I never put on the basketball hoop.

1623
01:42:33.68 --> 01:42:35.68
But yeah, I mean, if I were to under,

1624
01:42:35.68 --> 01:42:38.68
to read the whole thing, read the whole thing and I wouldn't read it.

1625
01:42:38.68 --> 01:42:41.68
Would it say me like three hours?

1626
01:42:41.68 --> 01:42:42.68
Back to the book.

1627
01:42:42.68 --> 01:42:43.68
When you are stumped,

1628
01:42:43.68 --> 01:42:46.68
maybe because you have taken the wrong approach to the problem,

1629
01:42:46.68 --> 01:42:48.68
it's easy to get into a rut in thinking.

1630
01:42:48.68 --> 01:42:51.68
And it's hard to shake yourself loose from one point of view

1631
01:42:51.68 --> 01:42:52.68
and see a completely new one.

1632
01:42:52.68 --> 01:42:55.68
This stuff is so simply stated that it's,

1633
01:42:55.68 --> 01:42:58.68
you underestimate the power of what's being said right here.

1634
01:42:58.68 --> 01:42:59.68
Yeah.

1635
01:42:59.68 --> 01:43:01.68
This stuff is life savers.

1636
01:43:01.68 --> 01:43:06.68
You tend to keep going back and repeating this same old kind of attack

1637
01:43:06.68 --> 01:43:08.68
that has always failed.

1638
01:43:08.68 --> 01:43:10.68
It's like feeling in the same,

1639
01:43:10.68 --> 01:43:15.68
it's like feeling in the same pocket six times when you've lost your cigarettes

1640
01:43:15.68 --> 01:43:18.68
and cannot find them.

1641
01:43:18.68 --> 01:43:23.68
Especially is it hard to try new methods when you are tired

1642
01:43:23.68 --> 01:43:26.68
or nervous over your failure to get the right answer.

1643
01:43:26.68 --> 01:43:30.68
At such times, it is best to close your book and work on something else

1644
01:43:30.68 --> 01:43:33.68
or to do something outdoors with fresh air

1645
01:43:33.68 --> 01:43:35.68
or even if you can afford the time, take a nap.

1646
01:43:35.68 --> 01:43:37.68
When you come back to your problem,

1647
01:43:37.68 --> 01:43:40.68
the new approach may come to you in a flash.

1648
01:43:40.68 --> 01:43:44.68
And from then on, the work may go quickly and smoothly.

1649
01:43:44.68 --> 01:43:46.68
Yeah.

1650
01:43:46.68 --> 01:43:49.68
I have to actually, that's one of those things.

1651
01:43:49.68 --> 01:43:53.68
I'm pretty instinctive on a lot of things that I do

1652
01:43:53.68 --> 01:43:55.68
in terms of things that I talk about

1653
01:43:55.68 --> 01:43:57.68
and the way I actually apply them in my life.

1654
01:43:57.68 --> 01:43:59.68
I'm pretty good at most of them.

1655
01:43:59.68 --> 01:44:02.68
Most of them, I'm not even, I don't have to consciously.

1656
01:44:02.68 --> 01:44:03.68
I can't kind of look back and go,

1657
01:44:03.68 --> 01:44:06.68
I see what I did and I'm really stoked on it.

1658
01:44:06.68 --> 01:44:09.68
I can do that, especially in GJ2.

1659
01:44:09.68 --> 01:44:12.68
I can get in a rut and be like, oh, I'm just going to do this right here

1660
01:44:12.68 --> 01:44:14.68
and it should work because I've done it before

1661
01:44:14.68 --> 01:44:15.68
and it's going to work this time.

1662
01:44:15.68 --> 01:44:19.68
And I'll have to consciously, oh, you're beating your head

1663
01:44:19.68 --> 01:44:20.68
against the wall.

1664
01:44:20.68 --> 01:44:22.68
And I'll have to do a different approach.

1665
01:44:22.68 --> 01:44:23.68
Yeah.

1666
01:44:23.68 --> 01:44:27.68
But I mean, that's very, it's kind of demonstrates you humility

1667
01:44:27.68 --> 01:44:29.68
because you've always, like, every time we roll in at,

1668
01:44:29.68 --> 01:44:32.68
actually, when I see you rolling with other, like, really good guys,

1669
01:44:32.68 --> 01:44:35.68
it seems like you adapt and make little changes

1670
01:44:35.68 --> 01:44:39.68
way quicker than most people in for dang sure way quicker than me.

1671
01:44:39.68 --> 01:44:40.68
I feel like I'm all that.

1672
01:44:40.68 --> 01:44:43.68
Like what you just said, I feel like that's just 100% me.

1673
01:44:43.68 --> 01:44:44.68
Yeah, yeah.

1674
01:44:44.68 --> 01:44:47.68
No, what I'm saying is, but I'm sure I'm okay at it.

1675
01:44:47.68 --> 01:44:50.68
I mean, I know I'm okay at it, but even me,

1676
01:44:50.68 --> 01:44:54.68
at this point, I'll be like, oh, he's not going to put his arm there.

1677
01:44:54.68 --> 01:44:56.68
You've tried it three times in a row.

1678
01:44:56.68 --> 01:44:57.68
It's not working.

1679
01:44:57.68 --> 01:44:59.68
You need to do something else.

1680
01:44:59.68 --> 01:45:00.68
Yeah, you can recognize me.

1681
01:45:00.68 --> 01:45:03.68
I recognize when I'm beating my head up against the wall.

1682
01:45:03.68 --> 01:45:04.68
Yeah.

1683
01:45:04.68 --> 01:45:06.68
And that's not a good feeling.

1684
01:45:06.68 --> 01:45:09.68
And it's, but the great feeling is as soon as you do something different,

1685
01:45:09.68 --> 01:45:13.68
generally, you may not get told success, but you won't get the same outcome

1686
01:45:13.68 --> 01:45:16.68
because the outcome is failing, which we don't like.

1687
01:45:16.68 --> 01:45:17.68
No, no, no.

1688
01:45:17.68 --> 01:45:20.68
How to make learning stick.

1689
01:45:20.68 --> 01:45:27.68
The two basic principles of learning anything are interest and participation.

1690
01:45:27.68 --> 01:45:31.68
It is not true that repetition alone is the basis of learning something well.

1691
01:45:31.68 --> 01:45:36.68
A man who repeats an act again and again with his mind only half of what he is doing.

1692
01:45:36.68 --> 01:45:39.68
It was mind only half on what he is doing.

1693
01:45:39.68 --> 01:45:44.68
May indeed learn it, but he will learn it neither quickly nor well.

1694
01:45:44.68 --> 01:45:50.68
Fortunately, doing a thing and practicing it usually reinforce a man's interest

1695
01:45:50.68 --> 01:45:54.68
so that there is really only one important principle,

1696
01:45:54.68 --> 01:45:57.68
interest at the bottom of learning.

1697
01:45:57.68 --> 01:46:03.68
Active participation is secured by practice lectures are used only when preliminary explanation

1698
01:46:03.68 --> 01:46:09.68
at some length is needed, or when men cannot be put through the work itself.

1699
01:46:09.68 --> 01:46:15.68
You're not only told how to fire a rifle, you are helped actually to do the firing.

1700
01:46:15.68 --> 01:46:19.68
And you work out of doors in the way that you will later work in combat.

1701
01:46:19.68 --> 01:46:26.68
You do under instruction what later on you are going to have to do in combat yourself.

1702
01:46:26.68 --> 01:46:28.68
So you have to do these things.

1703
01:46:28.68 --> 01:46:31.68
Interest is secured in a variety of ways.

1704
01:46:31.68 --> 01:46:36.68
Number one, the personality of the instructor is important.

1705
01:46:36.68 --> 01:46:38.68
It should be dynamic and fort.

1706
01:46:38.68 --> 01:46:43.68
It should be a dynamic and forceful person who appreciates the fact that learning takes time

1707
01:46:43.68 --> 01:46:45.68
and that some men are slower than others.

1708
01:46:45.68 --> 01:46:48.68
He must stimulate his men to want to learn.

1709
01:46:48.68 --> 01:46:52.68
Two instruction must finally become individual.

1710
01:46:52.68 --> 01:46:57.68
There must be close contact between some instructor in every soldier.

1711
01:46:57.68 --> 01:47:04.68
Three, the relation of the learning to the problems of combat must always be stressed.

1712
01:47:04.68 --> 01:47:09.68
Four, although non-essentials are admitted in army teaching,

1713
01:47:09.68 --> 01:47:15.68
it is important that the soldier should understand the basic principles of what he is doing.

1714
01:47:15.68 --> 01:47:21.68
If he is learning how to use a machine, then he should know how the machine works.

1715
01:47:21.68 --> 01:47:26.68
Critical.

1716
01:47:26.68 --> 01:47:35.68
And number five, the soldier must also have full knowledge of the purpose of what he learns of why he needs to know it.

1717
01:47:35.68 --> 01:47:40.68
Only with such knowledge can his interest be at the highest.

1718
01:47:40.68 --> 01:47:47.68
And only with such knowledge is he able to adapt what he has learned to different circumstances that arise in combat.

1719
01:47:47.68 --> 01:47:50.68
So he's got to know why.

1720
01:47:50.68 --> 01:47:59.68
And it also says here that all army commanders are leaders and teachers.

1721
01:47:59.68 --> 01:48:07.68
So if you're a leader, you are a teacher.

1722
01:48:07.68 --> 01:48:10.68
Talking a little bit here about efficiency and training,

1723
01:48:10.68 --> 01:48:17.68
the simplest kind of learning is to learn by trial and error, but this isn't the best, the most efficient way.

1724
01:48:17.68 --> 01:48:27.68
The way too much time ends are the army never uses an except in solving original problems where one method after another may be tried or at least imagined.

1725
01:48:27.68 --> 01:48:29.68
So trial and error is never the best.

1726
01:48:29.68 --> 01:48:31.68
Here's a good one.

1727
01:48:31.68 --> 01:48:36.68
In battle, a leader can give orders, but only brief ones sometimes by signal.

1728
01:48:36.68 --> 01:48:46.68
The soldier receiving such an order must also see the battle situation right around him in deciding how to best carry out that order.

1729
01:48:46.68 --> 01:48:51.68
Next, how to speed up training.

1730
01:48:51.68 --> 01:49:02.68
Will to learn soldiers' common sense tells him any must learn how to fight before he meets the enemy.

1731
01:49:02.68 --> 01:49:05.68
Number two, interest.

1732
01:49:05.68 --> 01:49:08.68
Number three, discipline.

1733
01:49:08.68 --> 01:49:13.68
Soldiers are trained to realize the serious importance of the things they are taught.

1734
01:49:13.68 --> 01:49:17.68
How much these things will mean in combat later on.

1735
01:49:17.68 --> 01:49:21.68
Number four, individual instruction.

1736
01:49:21.68 --> 01:49:25.68
Number five, experience of success.

1737
01:49:25.68 --> 01:49:31.68
Army instructors try their best to see that each man does a thing right the first time,

1738
01:49:31.68 --> 01:49:38.68
even by holding his hand and putting it through the correct movements if necessary.

1739
01:49:38.68 --> 01:49:42.68
Number six, elimination of non-essentials.

1740
01:49:42.68 --> 01:49:46.68
You've only supposed to be learning things that you actually need to know.

1741
01:49:46.68 --> 01:49:49.68
Number seven, all around attack.

1742
01:49:49.68 --> 01:49:55.68
Every possible way of reaching the soldier's student mind is utilized.

1743
01:49:55.68 --> 01:50:00.68
And then this instruction is immediately put to use in action on the job.

1744
01:50:00.68 --> 01:50:05.68
Soldiers learn by doing so as far as possible instruction is kept practical and concrete.

1745
01:50:05.68 --> 01:50:11.68
If an instructor puts too much emphasis on training men in the particular details of doing a job,

1746
01:50:11.68 --> 01:50:16.68
soldier fails to get a clear understanding of the result aimed at it.

1747
01:50:16.68 --> 01:50:22.68
Although men in training, although in training men in many different army jobs,

1748
01:50:22.68 --> 01:50:27.68
adequate attention must be paid to the detailed steps to be taken to reach the final objective.

1749
01:50:27.68 --> 01:50:33.68
The aim itself must also be made entirely clear to the soldier.

1750
01:50:33.68 --> 01:50:35.68
This is cool when I train little kids and jiu-jitsu.

1751
01:50:35.68 --> 01:50:37.68
I'm like, you just gotta get around their legs.

1752
01:50:37.68 --> 01:50:41.68
And you tell them that and they'll figure out how to do it.

1753
01:50:41.68 --> 01:50:45.68
And then when they get stumped, you teach them some actual technique.

1754
01:50:45.68 --> 01:50:58.68
Otherwise, he's apt to become confused in battle if the situation changes and he cannot follow the steps in exactly the way he was taught in training.

1755
01:50:58.68 --> 01:51:06.68
Efficiency in the army, every ounce of the soldier's energy should be concentrated on the defeat of the enemy.

1756
01:51:06.68 --> 01:51:16.68
Whenever he waste his strength on any sort of activity that does not contribute to that one end, it is an effect casualty.

1757
01:51:16.68 --> 01:51:20.68
No where is efficiency more important than in combat.

1758
01:51:20.68 --> 01:51:25.68
There, every man must work at the very peak of his powers.

1759
01:51:25.68 --> 01:51:28.68
His eyes must see better than the enemy's eyes.

1760
01:51:28.68 --> 01:51:30.68
His ears must hear better.

1761
01:51:30.68 --> 01:51:31.68
He must think better.

1762
01:51:31.68 --> 01:51:36.68
On this victory depends.

1763
01:51:36.68 --> 01:51:42.68
Wearyness, tired hands, or eyes, or nervous system.

1764
01:51:42.68 --> 01:51:48.68
Anything that reduces the soldier's efficiency at a critical moment in combat may cost him his life.

1765
01:51:48.68 --> 01:51:55.68
It may cost the army a position and advance a battle.

1766
01:51:55.68 --> 01:52:01.68
The enemy usually refuses to recognize the end of a work day.

1767
01:52:01.68 --> 01:52:04.68
Nature often provides the only lighting.

1768
01:52:04.68 --> 01:52:06.68
Bomb holes and sure ventilation.

1769
01:52:06.68 --> 01:52:14.68
When a soldier gets an actual combat, one of his calls upon to do seems to have no similarity at all to anything he had ever done in a civilian job.

1770
01:52:14.68 --> 01:52:19.68
There is no routine in battle, no standardization, no monotonous repetition.

1771
01:52:19.68 --> 01:52:24.68
Each moment is a challenging new experience calling for new decisions and fresh insight.

1772
01:52:24.68 --> 01:52:35.68
It is hard to see where the combat soldier can get any help at all from what he has learned about efficiency in a factory far from the battle zone.

1773
01:52:35.68 --> 01:52:43.68
That is why a soldier in training must learn from the start to cut out useless and round about movements that take need of this time.

1774
01:52:43.68 --> 01:52:46.68
Seconds count.

1775
01:52:46.68 --> 01:52:49.68
And a soldier's energy counts too.

1776
01:52:49.68 --> 01:52:57.68
He can't afford to get worn down before his job is done. He must keep his speed and accuracy up to top notch performance.

1777
01:52:57.68 --> 01:52:59.68
Any blundering combat may be fatal.

1778
01:52:59.68 --> 01:53:02.68
There he may not be able to miss an aim again.

1779
01:53:02.68 --> 01:53:08.68
He may never have another chance.

1780
01:53:08.68 --> 01:53:12.68
Now we get into this last little section that we're going to cover today.

1781
01:53:12.68 --> 01:53:13.68
It's about fatigue.

1782
01:53:13.68 --> 01:53:16.68
But sleep.

1783
01:53:16.68 --> 01:53:19.68
That other enemy.

1784
01:53:19.68 --> 01:53:26.68
Fettig is a fifth column enemy that is always ready to infiltrate and attack.

1785
01:53:26.68 --> 01:53:31.68
No man can stick at a job for long periods through the day and night and continue at top notch performance,

1786
01:53:31.68 --> 01:53:41.68
especially if his job involves using a great deal of strength, keeping alert and making accurate split second decisions.

1787
01:53:41.68 --> 01:53:44.68
So you're allegedly need rest.

1788
01:53:44.68 --> 01:53:47.68
I posted the other day sleep as the enemy.

1789
01:53:47.68 --> 01:53:51.68
And people get so it's a song by dango Jones.

1790
01:53:51.68 --> 01:53:53.68
And it's a great song.

1791
01:53:53.68 --> 01:54:00.68
But I kind of do feel that way because it's pretty easy just to fold to sleep and spend all day.

1792
01:54:00.68 --> 01:54:02.68
But I know you don't see it that way.

1793
01:54:02.68 --> 01:54:04.68
But I kind of do.

1794
01:54:04.68 --> 01:54:06.68
Sleep as enemy just like food is the enemy.

1795
01:54:06.68 --> 01:54:07.68
Yeah.

1796
01:54:07.68 --> 01:54:10.68
If you start a pubic in making, you know, like,

1797
01:54:10.68 --> 01:54:11.68
Good.

1798
01:54:11.68 --> 01:54:14.68
Good man. Good point.

1799
01:54:14.68 --> 01:54:21.68
Just how long men can work and continue to do their best depends upon a great many different things.

1800
01:54:21.68 --> 01:54:24.68
It depends first upon the man.

1801
01:54:24.68 --> 01:54:26.68
It depends also on the type of work.

1802
01:54:26.68 --> 01:54:31.68
It depends upon the conditions of the work, upon the foodie, and upon rest obtained during the job, upon

1803
01:54:31.68 --> 01:54:35.68
worry and excitement and finally upon the necessity for action.

1804
01:54:35.68 --> 01:54:40.68
A man can run fast and long if death or the devil is behind him.

1805
01:54:40.68 --> 01:54:49.68
He can fight hard for unbelievable lengths of time if there can be no retreat or a victory is in sight.

1806
01:54:49.68 --> 01:54:53.68
Most hazardous is the fatigue which comes from spurts of extreme effort.

1807
01:54:53.68 --> 01:55:01.68
The greatest of which a man is capable such supreme effort seldom if ever occurs in any job on the home front.

1808
01:55:01.68 --> 01:55:03.68
It does occur in sport.

1809
01:55:03.68 --> 01:55:05.68
It does occur in battle.

1810
01:55:05.68 --> 01:55:19.68
It's spurred by the necessity to extraordinary violence a man may actually put out so much effort that he burns up his body fuel at a rate eight times more than the normal rate.

1811
01:55:19.68 --> 01:55:21.68
I have no idea where they got these numbers.

1812
01:55:21.68 --> 01:55:23.68
I had eight times more.

1813
01:55:23.68 --> 01:55:24.68
That's a pretty accurate.

1814
01:55:24.68 --> 01:55:29.68
This he cannot keep up more than a few minutes at a time.

1815
01:55:29.68 --> 01:55:32.68
Otherwise, the sugar in his blood will fail.

1816
01:55:32.68 --> 01:55:35.68
The fall to a critically low level. His heart will fail.

1817
01:55:35.68 --> 01:55:38.68
His collapse or even death will follow.

1818
01:55:38.68 --> 01:55:41.68
What do you think, bro science right there?

1819
01:55:41.68 --> 01:55:44.68
Well, I mean, then you make a good point where you.

1820
01:55:44.68 --> 01:55:46.68
Where you got these?

1821
01:55:46.68 --> 01:55:48.68
I don't know where you got those numbers from.

1822
01:55:48.68 --> 01:55:49.68
Well, we do people get rabdo.

1823
01:55:49.68 --> 01:55:50.68
Yes.

1824
01:55:50.68 --> 01:55:54.68
But you get rabdo. You don't like fail on the moment.

1825
01:55:54.68 --> 01:55:56.68
Your heart doesn't fail.

1826
01:55:56.68 --> 01:56:03.68
I would like the first thing I thought of is like in the digits or MMA where you get to be a adrenaline dump, right?

1827
01:56:03.68 --> 01:56:06.68
Because you're so like,

1828
01:56:06.68 --> 01:56:11.68
I mean, it's through adrenaline, but like it's these external circumstances like around the stage.

1829
01:56:11.68 --> 01:56:14.68
Usually it's in your competitions, necessarily in training.

1830
01:56:14.68 --> 01:56:15.68
So you're on the stage.

1831
01:56:15.68 --> 01:56:16.68
So it's win.

1832
01:56:16.68 --> 01:56:17.68
It's a door die.

1833
01:56:17.68 --> 01:56:18.68
Yeah.

1834
01:56:18.68 --> 01:56:19.68
On stage.

1835
01:56:19.68 --> 01:56:20.68
It's not a door die.

1836
01:56:20.68 --> 01:56:22.68
But that's what you guys are.

1837
01:56:22.68 --> 01:56:23.68
This is a common story.

1838
01:56:23.68 --> 01:56:24.68
Yes, but so.

1839
01:56:24.68 --> 01:56:28.68
I was just thinking like, if this is true, like when a guy gets gasped in the UFC,

1840
01:56:28.68 --> 01:56:30.68
and he just can't go on,

1841
01:56:30.68 --> 01:56:35.68
but then what if somebody came in there with a machete and was like run.

1842
01:56:35.68 --> 01:56:36.68
Or a hacky to pieces.

1843
01:56:36.68 --> 01:56:37.68
Yeah.

1844
01:56:37.68 --> 01:56:38.68
I think the guy would do.

1845
01:56:38.68 --> 01:56:39.68
Yeah, you run.

1846
01:56:39.68 --> 01:56:42.68
But that's like another level of stress.

1847
01:56:42.68 --> 01:56:43.68
So that's door die.

1848
01:56:43.68 --> 01:56:44.68
Yes.

1849
01:56:44.68 --> 01:56:46.68
That's door die out there on the UFC or whatever.

1850
01:56:46.68 --> 01:56:47.68
And that's not accurate.

1851
01:56:47.68 --> 01:56:48.68
No, sir.

1852
01:56:48.68 --> 01:56:49.68
It's not.

1853
01:56:49.68 --> 01:56:50.68
It's very inaccurate.

1854
01:56:50.68 --> 01:56:53.68
But as an example, it feels like that's, you know,

1855
01:56:53.68 --> 01:56:57.68
like, they're so, but they're using like probably eight times the energy,

1856
01:56:57.68 --> 01:57:00.68
you know, because they're so pumped up because of their on stage and stuff,

1857
01:57:00.68 --> 01:57:01.68
the nerves and all that stuff.

1858
01:57:01.68 --> 01:57:02.68
So it's like that.

1859
01:57:02.68 --> 01:57:04.68
You know, it's another weird one.

1860
01:57:04.68 --> 01:57:06.68
When someone gasses or whatever,

1861
01:57:06.68 --> 01:57:07.68
and then they end up winning.

1862
01:57:07.68 --> 01:57:09.68
And then they get that other surge from the other.

1863
01:57:09.68 --> 01:57:10.68
And then they're just like,

1864
01:57:10.68 --> 01:57:11.68
I don't know.

1865
01:57:11.68 --> 01:57:11.68
Yeah.

1866
01:57:11.68 --> 01:57:13.68
You're like, I'm just a couple of 10 seconds ago.

1867
01:57:13.68 --> 01:57:15.68
Why don't you put that effort out, bro?

1868
01:57:15.68 --> 01:57:16.68
Yeah.

1869
01:57:16.68 --> 01:57:18.68
So that proves.

1870
01:57:18.68 --> 01:57:20.68
I read about this in the field manual.

1871
01:57:20.68 --> 01:57:22.68
Like sometimes you got to use emotion.

1872
01:57:22.68 --> 01:57:23.68
Sometimes you got to use logic.

1873
01:57:23.68 --> 01:57:24.68
Sometimes you got to use logic.

1874
01:57:24.68 --> 01:57:25.68
Sometimes you got to use that emotion come out.

1875
01:57:25.68 --> 01:57:26.68
Yeah.

1876
01:57:26.68 --> 01:57:30.68
So, but all that, the thing is like, that does sound funny and look funny.

1877
01:57:30.68 --> 01:57:32.68
If a guy like seems to be sort of guessing.

1878
01:57:32.68 --> 01:57:36.68
Then right, literally the second he wins, he's running with his hand in there.

1879
01:57:36.68 --> 01:57:40.68
But all that is, that's not like a, like a,

1880
01:57:40.68 --> 01:57:43.68
like a maybe a slack or a theerson, nothing like that.

1881
01:57:43.68 --> 01:57:45.68
That's like just the stress.

1882
01:57:45.68 --> 01:57:48.68
And winning is like, I don't know if I'd call it a stress,

1883
01:57:48.68 --> 01:57:50.68
but I guess this is what I heard this is.

1884
01:57:50.68 --> 01:57:52.68
I heard this from people.

1885
01:57:52.68 --> 01:57:54.68
I didn't really do this any official thing.

1886
01:57:54.68 --> 01:57:57.68
But you get like this boost of like hormones,

1887
01:57:57.68 --> 01:58:01.68
like testosterone and all these crazy hormones when you win the fight.

1888
01:58:01.68 --> 01:58:05.68
So maybe to that, it's like man, it's not like it's controllable.

1889
01:58:05.68 --> 01:58:11.68
You have to actually be confronted with a stimulus of winning for that free to get that boost.

1890
01:58:11.68 --> 01:58:17.68
Just like you're confronted with a stimulus of the crowd to get that overdrive scenario.

1891
01:58:17.68 --> 01:58:21.68
You're using eight times the energy.

1892
01:58:21.68 --> 01:58:22.68
Back to the book.

1893
01:58:22.68 --> 01:58:26.68
Yet such busy fatigue does not always make you inefficient.

1894
01:58:26.68 --> 01:58:30.68
If you have strong enough need or desire for action.

1895
01:58:30.68 --> 01:58:31.68
I like that right there.

1896
01:58:31.68 --> 01:58:34.68
Yeah, that's the machete scenario that you just introduced.

1897
01:58:34.68 --> 01:58:37.68
Sometimes I wonder if I'm like perpetually in a state of like,

1898
01:58:37.68 --> 01:58:40.68
or I wonder that my brain too.

1899
01:58:40.68 --> 01:58:43.68
Because sometimes I can't sleep at all.

1900
01:58:43.68 --> 01:58:45.68
I believe that.

1901
01:58:45.68 --> 01:58:51.68
And because I want to get up, I'm not like that all the time.

1902
01:58:51.68 --> 01:58:55.68
I mean, there's definitely days where I sleep really soundly.

1903
01:58:55.68 --> 01:58:58.68
But a lot of times it's like, no, it's not happening.

1904
01:58:58.68 --> 01:59:01.68
Because I got stuff I got to do or I'll war over here.

1905
01:59:01.68 --> 01:59:03.68
I'm lying over here.

1906
01:59:03.68 --> 01:59:04.68
I understand.

1907
01:59:04.68 --> 01:59:08.68
Mental work and emotional strain are also fatiguing.

1908
01:59:08.68 --> 01:59:11.68
But the man who gets tired from mental work or the strain of responsibility and

1909
01:59:11.68 --> 01:59:16.68
worry has additional problem. He may not consume the sugar in his blood as

1910
01:59:16.68 --> 01:59:19.68
does the man engage in a violent physical worker combat.

1911
01:59:19.68 --> 01:59:21.68
His blood therefore gets out of balance.

1912
01:59:21.68 --> 01:59:23.68
This is gross science coming out.

1913
01:59:23.68 --> 01:59:26.68
And the rest of sleep may not readily restore it's actually weird because

1914
01:59:26.68 --> 01:59:28.68
it's gross science, but it makes sense.

1915
01:59:28.68 --> 01:59:29.68
Yes.

1916
01:59:29.68 --> 01:59:30.68
I guess all gross science kind of makes sense.

1917
01:59:30.68 --> 01:59:31.68
That's gross science, right?

1918
01:59:31.68 --> 01:59:35.68
It is good for the man who's been under this sort of strain to get

1919
01:59:35.68 --> 01:59:37.68
some sort of physical exercise.

1920
01:59:37.68 --> 01:59:39.68
A swift game of tennis.

1921
01:59:39.68 --> 01:59:43.68
A long walk or a turn at shopping would.

1922
01:59:43.68 --> 01:59:47.68
A second effective fatigue is the tired feeling.

1923
01:59:47.68 --> 01:59:49.68
I think that's funny.

1924
01:59:49.68 --> 01:59:54.68
This is nature's natural protection against over fatigue.

1925
01:59:54.68 --> 01:59:59.68
When a man feels tired it becomes increasingly difficult for him to go on with his

1926
01:59:59.68 --> 02:00:06.68
job. He is more and more eager for rest and sleep less and less able to

1927
02:00:06.68 --> 02:00:09.68
spur himself on to go another mile.

1928
02:00:09.68 --> 02:00:13.68
The best antidote for this feeling of tiredness is high morale and the example of

1929
02:00:13.68 --> 02:00:14.68
other men.

1930
02:00:14.68 --> 02:00:19.68
It is the man working alone who has the hardest job in combating his own desire to lie

1931
02:00:19.68 --> 02:00:21.68
down and sleep.

1932
02:00:21.68 --> 02:00:25.68
But the most important effective fatigue is the effect it has on work.

1933
02:00:25.68 --> 02:00:27.68
When a man is tired he doesn't.

1934
02:00:27.68 --> 02:00:30.68
He cannot do his very best.

1935
02:00:30.68 --> 02:00:34.68
The amount of work he is able to do falls off and the quality of his work suffers

1936
02:00:34.68 --> 02:00:37.68
too. He does not see it as well.

1937
02:00:37.68 --> 02:00:39.68
It does not hear as well.

1938
02:00:39.68 --> 02:00:41.68
Nor is he so alert.

1939
02:00:41.68 --> 02:00:44.68
His movements may become clumsy and bungling.

1940
02:00:44.68 --> 02:00:46.68
In loss of loss and efficiency,

1941
02:00:46.68 --> 02:00:50.68
strange that may seem is not always related to feelings of fatigue.

1942
02:00:50.68 --> 02:00:55.68
A man may feel very tired when he has not been working particularly hard but is merely

1943
02:00:55.68 --> 02:00:58.68
bored or uninterested in his work.

1944
02:00:58.68 --> 02:01:01.68
When the ventilation is so bad that he gets dopey.

1945
02:01:01.68 --> 02:01:08.68
This is important. On the other hand, a man really close to exhaustion may be so excited

1946
02:01:08.68 --> 02:01:12.68
by his work that he is unable to rest and is not feel tired at all.

1947
02:01:12.68 --> 02:01:15.68
Consider this.

1948
02:01:15.68 --> 02:01:17.68
That's what I think.

1949
02:01:17.68 --> 02:01:19.68
Consider this like,

1950
02:01:19.68 --> 02:01:21.68
indudiu.

1951
02:01:21.68 --> 02:01:24.68
Right now, if I were to talk enough smack to you right now.

1952
02:01:24.68 --> 02:01:26.68
No matter how you feel, you be tired.

1953
02:01:26.68 --> 02:01:30.68
You can be one hour sleep. You can be doing all this stuff like before and whatever.

1954
02:01:30.68 --> 02:01:31.68
You can be tired.

1955
02:01:31.68 --> 02:01:35.68
Talking enough smack and telling you to roll outside. You'll probably do it.

1956
02:01:35.68 --> 02:01:36.68
There's no problem.

1957
02:01:36.68 --> 02:01:37.68
Yeah.

1958
02:01:37.68 --> 02:01:42.68
But if I say, okay, after this, go run on a treadmill.

1959
02:01:42.68 --> 02:01:43.68
It's easier.

1960
02:01:43.68 --> 02:01:44.68
It's easier.

1961
02:01:44.68 --> 02:01:45.68
I'll put.

1962
02:01:45.68 --> 02:01:46.68
Well.

1963
02:01:52.68 --> 02:01:54.68
I guess I kind of walked into that.

1964
02:01:54.68 --> 02:02:00.68
Anyway, it's debatably easier to run on a treadmill.

1965
02:02:00.68 --> 02:02:03.68
But man, you ever run a treadmill?

1966
02:02:03.68 --> 02:02:07.68
I've been riding a treadmill probably 10 times in my whole life.

1967
02:02:07.68 --> 02:02:08.68
Yeah.

1968
02:02:08.68 --> 02:02:10.68
And you know, I used to get into a treadmill, but man,

1969
02:02:10.68 --> 02:02:12.68
if when you get when that boredom hits you,

1970
02:02:12.68 --> 02:02:15.68
probably you're like, I can't run on a step on this damn thing.

1971
02:02:15.68 --> 02:02:17.68
Even though I could easily go train right now.

1972
02:02:17.68 --> 02:02:19.68
No, it's like a bunch of good guys.

1973
02:02:19.68 --> 02:02:20.68
Yeah.

1974
02:02:20.68 --> 02:02:21.68
So it's like, it's that exact thing.

1975
02:02:21.68 --> 02:02:24.68
And then you get bored, like, just a little bit of fatigue.

1976
02:02:24.68 --> 02:02:26.68
It's going to jam you at big time.

1977
02:02:26.68 --> 02:02:29.68
But even if you're really fatigued and you're doing something fun,

1978
02:02:29.68 --> 02:02:30.68
you'll go.

1979
02:02:30.68 --> 02:02:31.68
Yeah.

1980
02:02:31.68 --> 02:02:31.68
Oh, yeah.

1981
02:02:31.68 --> 02:02:34.68
For sure. That's why you did too such good exercise.

1982
02:02:34.68 --> 02:02:35.68
Because it's fun.

1983
02:02:35.68 --> 02:02:36.68
So true.

1984
02:02:36.68 --> 02:02:40.68
Men differ considerably in the rate at which they get tired on the same job.

1985
02:02:40.68 --> 02:02:44.68
They differ even more in their rates of recovery after work is over.

1986
02:02:44.68 --> 02:02:46.68
There's almost no general rule as to what will happen,

1987
02:02:46.68 --> 02:02:50.68
except that recovery is very rapid at first and slows down as the rest

1988
02:02:50.68 --> 02:02:51.68
of the approach.

1989
02:02:51.68 --> 02:02:56.68
The fact means however that a lot of good can be got out of short rest

1990
02:02:56.68 --> 02:02:59.68
and that many short rest are better than one long one.

1991
02:02:59.68 --> 02:03:02.68
That makes sense to me, taking a little power nap.

1992
02:03:02.68 --> 02:03:06.68
Students learn best if they do not do all learning at once.

1993
02:03:06.68 --> 02:03:08.68
Do not try and cram up before examinations,

1994
02:03:08.68 --> 02:03:12.68
but study a little and then quit for a while for a day or two.

1995
02:03:12.68 --> 02:03:18.68
In industry efficiency is highest when rest pauses are arranged at frequent intervals.

1996
02:03:18.68 --> 02:03:22.68
I agree with that. Although sometimes I just pull through stuff.

1997
02:03:22.68 --> 02:03:26.68
So it does not pay to overwork workers or soldiers.

1998
02:03:26.68 --> 02:03:31.68
Some fatigue is unavoidable and much fatigue must be undergone in the process of

1999
02:03:31.68 --> 02:03:33.68
toughening a soldier.

2000
02:03:33.68 --> 02:03:36.68
But chronic fatigue is not to be found along the shortest road

2001
02:03:36.68 --> 02:03:37.68
to victory.

2002
02:03:37.68 --> 02:03:39.68
So don't get tired.

2003
02:03:39.68 --> 02:03:42.68
Now it gets real specific on sleep.

2004
02:03:42.68 --> 02:03:44.68
You can stay up all night and keep awake.

2005
02:03:44.68 --> 02:03:48.68
And this I was surprised how accurate this reflects me.

2006
02:03:48.68 --> 02:03:51.68
I think you'll find it accurate as well.

2007
02:03:51.68 --> 02:03:55.68
You can stay up all night and keep awake provided you are active.

2008
02:03:55.68 --> 02:03:59.68
Provided you keep using some muscles at least the speaking muscles.

2009
02:03:59.68 --> 02:04:04.68
You can march all night play poker all night, fight all night and talk all night.

2010
02:04:04.68 --> 02:04:12.68
You will likely you will likely to get terribly sleepy somewhere between 0,300 and 0,600.

2011
02:04:12.68 --> 02:04:15.68
Unless you are doing something exciting or intensely interesting.

2012
02:04:15.68 --> 02:04:18.68
But you can get through that provided you are active.

2013
02:04:18.68 --> 02:04:19.68
So like this would happen a lot.

2014
02:04:19.68 --> 02:04:23.68
You go on a patrol and you patrol night to get to a position.

2015
02:04:23.68 --> 02:04:26.68
And then it's now 3 o'clock in the morning.

2016
02:04:26.68 --> 02:04:29.68
And that's when you get tired 4 o'clock in the morning.

2017
02:04:29.68 --> 02:04:31.68
You have a better that's when you get tired.

2018
02:04:31.68 --> 02:04:33.68
Then this happens.

2019
02:04:33.68 --> 02:04:35.68
You actually continue on.

2020
02:04:35.68 --> 02:04:40.68
That does not mean however that you can read or study all night using few muscles other than those of your eyes.

2021
02:04:40.68 --> 02:04:45.68
You have to study all night you may need to read out loud or stand up to read.

2022
02:04:45.68 --> 02:04:48.68
By the time because basically and that's totally true.

2023
02:04:48.68 --> 02:04:52.68
If you have a work to do and you're up working it's fine.

2024
02:04:52.68 --> 02:04:57.68
But if you are going to read this book in the next 10 hours and you're falling asleep.

2025
02:04:57.68 --> 02:05:06.68
Yeah and that's one of the reasons why if you like let's say you have a normal schedule job like a 9, 2, 5 and then you want to work out or go to your kids or something after work.

2026
02:05:06.68 --> 02:05:07.68
Don't go home.

2027
02:05:07.68 --> 02:05:16.68
Because when you go home you should run on the couch for a second or even if you just like you know just talk to your wife or whatever it's like.

2028
02:05:16.68 --> 02:05:21.68
Like rather than go home straight to the gym and you're that way.

2029
02:05:21.68 --> 02:05:23.68
That's advice you've ever given.

2030
02:05:23.68 --> 02:05:24.68
Seriously.

2031
02:05:24.68 --> 02:05:28.68
Like if you want to train don't go home go to the gym.

2032
02:05:28.68 --> 02:05:30.68
That's very good advice.

2033
02:05:30.68 --> 02:05:35.68
Then it goes on in it says by breakfast time you will be getting less sleepy.

2034
02:05:35.68 --> 02:05:38.68
And that's totally true if you stay up and that's once the sun's coming up.

2035
02:05:38.68 --> 02:05:40.68
You can get through the next day pretty well.

2036
02:05:40.68 --> 02:05:42.68
You may feel tired especially if you've been awake.

2037
02:05:42.68 --> 02:05:45.68
Especially if you've been marching and walking to keep awake.

2038
02:05:45.68 --> 02:05:46.68
You won't feel fresh.

2039
02:05:46.68 --> 02:05:47.68
You'll feel uncomfortable.

2040
02:05:47.68 --> 02:05:56.68
But other people will not notice anything wrong with you unless you sit down to relax with nothing important or interesting to do then very likely you'll do as off.

2041
02:05:56.68 --> 02:06:01.68
If you have a job that requires accurate movements or accurate thinking you'll probably make no more mistakes than you usually do.

2042
02:06:01.68 --> 02:06:03.68
So that's saying hey if you stay for 24 hours you're still going to go.

2043
02:06:03.68 --> 02:06:05.68
Next day.

2044
02:06:05.68 --> 02:06:07.68
Which I know you've done this at the master or close to it.

2045
02:06:07.68 --> 02:06:08.68
Right?

2046
02:06:08.68 --> 02:06:10.68
What you've done like an hour sleep to hours sleep?

2047
02:06:10.68 --> 02:06:11.68
Yeah.

2048
02:06:11.68 --> 02:06:12.68
Maybe for one day.

2049
02:06:12.68 --> 02:06:13.68
Yeah.

2050
02:06:13.68 --> 02:06:15.68
And the next second day you kind of hit the rag reel.

2051
02:06:15.68 --> 02:06:16.68
Yeah.

2052
02:06:16.68 --> 02:06:17.68
Big time.

2053
02:06:17.68 --> 02:06:21.68
The second night you won't want to stay up but you may have to.

2054
02:06:21.68 --> 02:06:26.68
Another March maybe necessary the enemy may attack and it's the second night and the second night is like the first.

2055
02:06:26.68 --> 02:06:27.68
But more difficult.

2056
02:06:27.68 --> 02:06:30.68
It's harder to keep active under your own power.

2057
02:06:30.68 --> 02:06:34.68
Yet you can if your officers in the enemy furnace the motivation.

2058
02:06:34.68 --> 02:06:38.68
You don't want to keep your mind on any topic very long.

2059
02:06:38.68 --> 02:06:41.68
Your thoughts and ideas will trail off into a relevant season.

2060
02:06:41.68 --> 02:06:45.68
If you can possibly get a chance to relax you will and then you'll go to sleep.

2061
02:06:45.68 --> 02:06:49.68
You ought not to be on century duty but you may keep awake by walking.

2062
02:06:49.68 --> 02:06:55.68
Or if you go off into an in-intensive days while you continue walking.

2063
02:06:55.68 --> 02:06:58.68
By this time you're probably getting quite irritable.

2064
02:06:58.68 --> 02:07:01.68
Little things provoke you and you may talk some nonsense.

2065
02:07:01.68 --> 02:07:04.68
Your anger does not last though you'd rather go to sleep.

2066
02:07:04.68 --> 02:07:09.68
The day after the second sleepless night is better than the preceding sleepless night.

2067
02:07:09.68 --> 02:07:16.68
But you'll be irritable, rambling and a logical and speech thought in in-intensive more than usually sensitive to pain.

2068
02:07:16.68 --> 02:07:19.68
Your eyes itch you may begin to see double you can't sit down or read.

2069
02:07:19.68 --> 02:07:22.68
Your hand ready becomes bad and pence made drop from your hand.

2070
02:07:22.68 --> 02:07:27.68
You may even begin to have hallucinations imagine events that do not really happen.

2071
02:07:27.68 --> 02:07:30.68
As if you'd be going to dream while you are still awake.

2072
02:07:30.68 --> 02:07:36.68
You can still be spurred to your full mental powers and manual dexterity if this is stimulus is strong enough.

2073
02:07:36.68 --> 02:07:42.68
If your commander demands your attention if a shell comes over but the effect of these things doesn't last as long as it would normally.

2074
02:07:42.68 --> 02:07:49.68
Pretty soon you're back to where you were with the most important thing in your world is to need the need to shut your eyes and go to sleep.

2075
02:07:49.68 --> 02:07:55.68
Wounded soldiers coming out of combat after many days and nights of continuing continuous flightings.

2076
02:07:55.68 --> 02:08:03.68
Fighting may be so terribly a need of sleep that even the severe pain of wounds is not keeping them from going sound asleep as soon as they are allowed to lie down.

2077
02:08:03.68 --> 02:08:06.68
Antisetics can be dispensed with.

2078
02:08:06.68 --> 02:08:11.68
So there you go. There's your second day and now you're in your second day.

2079
02:08:11.68 --> 02:08:16.68
Second full day without sleep. How long can you go without sleep?

2080
02:08:16.68 --> 02:08:24.68
You can manage a third night without sleep and maybe a fourth with all the symptoms getting worse with attention harder and harder to command.

2081
02:08:24.68 --> 02:08:27.68
With more activity necessary to keep you awake.

2082
02:08:27.68 --> 02:08:35.68
Psychologists once kept himself awake for four whole days spurred only on by scientific motive for seeing what would happen next.

2083
02:08:35.68 --> 02:08:38.68
With those doses of a stimulant.

2084
02:08:38.68 --> 02:08:43.68
Bens of dream which is like an anphetamine which I had to look up to help.

2085
02:08:43.68 --> 02:08:49.68
He may actually he actually kept himself awake for eight whole days and seven nights.

2086
02:08:49.68 --> 02:08:57.68
There was a man wants to believe that sleep was a bad habit which ought to and could be overcome.

2087
02:08:57.68 --> 02:09:02.68
He was given a watchman's clock on which to record every ten minutes the fact that he was awake.

2088
02:09:02.68 --> 02:09:11.68
He stayed awake almost continuously for nine and a half days missing only 31 out of 1,388 recordings of the ten minute intervals.

2089
02:09:11.68 --> 02:09:14.68
Of course he got some other catnaps during the ten minute intervals.

2090
02:09:14.68 --> 02:09:20.68
As time or on he became dazed. He could keep appointments at the wrong time or in the wrong place or both.

2091
02:09:20.68 --> 02:09:28.68
He got so he couldn't so that he was not always sure where he was at the end of the time he was beginning to have hallucinations and delusions of persecution

2092
02:09:28.68 --> 02:09:33.68
and had become so cantankerous that the experiment had to be stopped.

2093
02:09:33.68 --> 02:09:36.68
He just turned into seeing just got so angry.

2094
02:09:36.68 --> 02:09:38.68
It just had to shut it down.

2095
02:09:38.68 --> 02:09:41.68
Like it wasn't like he was going to die. He was just real mad at everyone.

2096
02:09:41.68 --> 02:09:44.68
Like we can't take this anymore.

2097
02:09:44.68 --> 02:09:48.68
So that's pretty accurate.

2098
02:09:48.68 --> 02:09:53.68
Going back to books sleep soon restores the sleepy man or animal.

2099
02:09:53.68 --> 02:09:58.68
The men who stay awake for two or three days are generally in pretty good shape after a 12 hour sleep

2100
02:09:58.68 --> 02:10:03.68
and show no effects at all after two or three normal nights. That's totally true.

2101
02:10:03.68 --> 02:10:07.68
You can get yourself back to normal real quick.

2102
02:10:07.68 --> 02:10:15.68
The whole trouble and sleeplessness is with attention and thus higher levels of the brain which are necessary for attention.

2103
02:10:15.68 --> 02:10:21.68
The soldier who loses sleep is becoming inefficient because he can no longer keep his mind on the job.

2104
02:10:21.68 --> 02:10:26.68
On any job except the one job of getting relaxation closed eyes and sleep.

2105
02:10:26.68 --> 02:10:32.68
He can be stimulated into attention by activity by a four-tative command by danger.

2106
02:10:32.68 --> 02:10:39.68
But the effect of the spur last less and less is time less and less time as he gets sleepier.

2107
02:10:39.68 --> 02:10:44.68
When spurred he can do almost any simple task as about as well as usual.

2108
02:10:44.68 --> 02:10:50.68
Unless it is a task that requires attention, alertness and judgment, then he begins to fail.

2109
02:10:50.68 --> 02:10:55.68
Being frustrated by not being allowed to sleep, he becomes irritable,

2110
02:10:55.68 --> 02:11:02.68
illiterate and perhaps even unmanageable. His morale goes down. He is no longer a good comrade.

2111
02:11:02.68 --> 02:11:09.68
But his recovery will be rapid. Given sleep, which is all he wants and pretty soon he'll be back, his old competent friendly alert self.

2112
02:11:09.68 --> 02:11:14.68
That's all right in an emergency, but ordinarily soldiers should have enough sleep.

2113
02:11:14.68 --> 02:11:24.68
They need to be alert whether for study or combat, whether driving a truck in America or firing an anti-tank gun in Africa or Europe.

2114
02:11:24.68 --> 02:11:29.68
Enough, regularly sleep from taps to first calls should be the rule.

2115
02:11:29.68 --> 02:11:37.68
Except when the enemy decrees otherwise, there is no rule about the amount of sleep the young adults must have.

2116
02:11:37.68 --> 02:11:43.68
Some get cranky and irritable when cut down from seven hours and night to five.

2117
02:11:43.68 --> 02:11:52.68
Others do not. The unit with high morale can do with less sleep, but sleepy men tend to have low morale.

2118
02:11:52.68 --> 02:11:56.68
These two forces work against each other.

2119
02:11:56.68 --> 02:12:01.68
There is also no rigid rules about the details of sleep.

2120
02:12:01.68 --> 02:12:05.68
No rules that apply to everyone alike.

2121
02:12:05.68 --> 02:12:11.68
And actually it's interesting because I'm here right now on a very minimal amount of sleep.

2122
02:12:11.68 --> 02:12:18.68
I had to fly to DC, I had a meeting in DC, it went late.

2123
02:12:18.68 --> 02:12:25.68
And when I got done with the meeting, got back to my hotel at midnight,

2124
02:12:25.68 --> 02:12:33.68
I had to prep this podcast. I was on West Coast time, so I was like, well, it's only 10 o'clock or whatever, 9 o'clock.

2125
02:12:33.68 --> 02:12:41.68
So I just stayed awake, my car pick up was at 3. I probably slept 40 minutes.

2126
02:12:41.68 --> 02:12:47.68
And then I did sleep on the plane, flying back from the east coast out to here.

2127
02:12:47.68 --> 02:12:52.68
I got at least probably three hours of sleep there uncomfortable.

2128
02:12:52.68 --> 02:12:56.68
You know, just not. Is that even sleep? We don't know. What does that count as?

2129
02:12:56.68 --> 02:13:02.68
And not try not. Don't have much sleep right now.

2130
02:13:02.68 --> 02:13:05.68
You don't pretty good. Yeah, it doesn't matter.

2131
02:13:05.68 --> 02:13:11.68
When people call you can't perform, I don't know. When people freak out and say, you can't.

2132
02:13:11.68 --> 02:13:17.68
There's no way you can perform as well. When you're sleeping, if you don't have enough sleep, it's like, I get it.

2133
02:13:17.68 --> 02:13:22.68
Hey, I'm not anti-sleep. If you need to sleep, mentally, as much as you can.

2134
02:13:22.68 --> 02:13:26.68
Sleep as much as you can. Sleep eight hours a day, sleep 10 hours a day.

2135
02:13:26.68 --> 02:13:29.68
I don't care. I'm not against you. I don't hold it against you.

2136
02:13:29.68 --> 02:13:40.68
But there's two things. Number one, if you have a lot of things that you need to do, and you spend a lot of time in bed, the things that you need to do, and it can happen.

2137
02:13:40.68 --> 02:13:45.68
So you may need to get out of bed and get things to happen. Number two, I don't even.

2138
02:13:45.68 --> 02:13:48.68
I have horrible feeling if I sleep a lot.

2139
02:13:48.68 --> 02:13:54.68
Not just, okay, I feel bad because I missed on doing some stuff that I'd probably need to do.

2140
02:13:54.68 --> 02:13:56.68
Also, I don't feel more rested.

2141
02:13:56.68 --> 02:14:00.68
Oh, yeah. Okay. I don't feel more rested if I sleep eight hours.

2142
02:14:00.68 --> 02:14:04.68
I feel sometimes worse.

2143
02:14:04.68 --> 02:14:10.68
So, yeah, and he essentially said everyone's different.

2144
02:14:10.68 --> 02:14:11.68
Yes.

2145
02:14:11.68 --> 02:14:12.68
Like there's no 100% of that.

2146
02:14:12.68 --> 02:14:14.68
So, man, I'm completely opposite.

2147
02:14:14.68 --> 02:14:17.68
I feel way more rested. Even seven hours, I'm good.

2148
02:14:17.68 --> 02:14:24.68
Six hours is I'm fine. Six hours. Two days in a row. I'm not that's when those symptoms start to creep.

2149
02:14:24.68 --> 02:14:28.68
Seven hours every single day, I find eight hours.

2150
02:14:28.68 --> 02:14:30.68
I feel like a boost.

2151
02:14:30.68 --> 02:14:36.68
I'm like, I'm a nine hours. I don't know if I could go nine hours more than one or two nights in a row.

2152
02:14:36.68 --> 02:14:38.68
Just physically, I just got up and went there.

2153
02:14:38.68 --> 02:14:42.68
But, oh, I could do the nine hours, and I'd be like, so all it's all it's all it's all it's all it.

2154
02:14:42.68 --> 02:14:46.68
After trying something out, after trying out and see if I feel more solid.

2155
02:14:46.68 --> 02:14:53.68
But you, you, you, you, you know, like you said people say, hey, you,

2156
02:14:53.68 --> 02:14:57.68
you, there's no way you can perform at your at your highest if you're like sleep deprived of whatever.

2157
02:14:57.68 --> 02:15:03.68
I would imagine just like how, you know, how they say in here that everyone's different.

2158
02:15:03.68 --> 02:15:05.68
Like your optimum versus your sub optimum,

2159
02:15:05.68 --> 02:15:11.68
you might be like super small, you know, where, you know, you feel little teeny tiny effects,

2160
02:15:11.68 --> 02:15:15.68
but your output or the results of your output or whatever are pretty similar.

2161
02:15:15.68 --> 02:15:18.68
They're almost pretty much unnoticable, even though,

2162
02:15:18.68 --> 02:15:23.68
you know, you could have done a little bit better with more sleep kind of thing, but, you know, just like,

2163
02:15:23.68 --> 02:15:26.68
and then opposed to me where, man, I go five hours of sleep.

2164
02:15:26.68 --> 02:15:29.68
The difference between six hours of sleep and five hours of sleep for me is like,

2165
02:15:29.68 --> 02:15:31.68
I feel like a completely different person.

2166
02:15:31.68 --> 02:15:34.68
Like, there is, yeah, I am, and there is one time,

2167
02:15:34.68 --> 02:15:36.68
it's like, remember because I was talking to life.

2168
02:15:36.68 --> 02:15:38.68
So it was the time when life was in town.

2169
02:15:38.68 --> 02:15:42.68
I got like, very hard-laning hours of sleep.

2170
02:15:42.68 --> 02:15:44.68
And I remember talking to them and thinking,

2171
02:15:44.68 --> 02:15:48.68
I believe, I think I'm stupid. I didn't even really make sense.

2172
02:15:48.68 --> 02:15:51.68
I mean, I don't know if you noticed it, but I noticed it.

2173
02:15:51.68 --> 02:15:54.68
But then, yeah, if I got like six or seven or whatever school?

2174
02:15:54.68 --> 02:15:57.68
Well, for everyone that freaks out,

2175
02:15:57.68 --> 02:16:00.68
I'm not saying don't sleep.

2176
02:16:00.68 --> 02:16:02.68
Sleep, sleep a bunch.

2177
02:16:02.68 --> 02:16:04.68
Sleep all you want.

2178
02:16:04.68 --> 02:16:05.68
It's fine.

2179
02:16:05.68 --> 02:16:10.68
You don't sound very confident, or you don't sound very like,

2180
02:16:10.68 --> 02:16:16.68
well, it's probably because I don't, because you only got three hours of sleep.

2181
02:16:16.68 --> 02:16:18.68
Well, yeah, you're irritable.

2182
02:16:18.68 --> 02:16:19.68
You're irritable right now.

2183
02:16:19.68 --> 02:16:24.68
I think it's because I get that you should sleep,

2184
02:16:24.68 --> 02:16:27.68
but I think people take advantage of it real quick.

2185
02:16:27.68 --> 02:16:28.68
That makes sense.

2186
02:16:28.68 --> 02:16:30.68
They start just getting into, you know,

2187
02:16:30.68 --> 02:16:32.68
I am just going to sleep all the time.

2188
02:16:32.68 --> 02:16:34.68
It's like when someone says, dark chocolate is good for you.

2189
02:16:34.68 --> 02:16:36.68
He don't know what's in it.

2190
02:16:36.68 --> 02:16:37.68
I don't know.

2191
02:16:37.68 --> 02:16:37.68
I don't know.

2192
02:16:37.68 --> 02:16:37.68
You don't know what's in it.

2193
02:16:37.68 --> 02:16:37.68
I don't know.

2194
02:16:37.68 --> 02:16:37.68
You don't know what's in it.

2195
02:16:37.68 --> 02:16:37.68
I don't know.

2196
02:16:37.68 --> 02:16:37.68
You don't know what's in it.

2197
02:16:37.68 --> 02:16:37.68
I don't know.

2198
02:16:37.68 --> 02:16:37.68
You don't know.

2199
02:16:37.68 --> 02:16:37.68
I don't know.

2200
02:16:37.68 --> 02:16:37.68
You don't know.

2201
02:16:37.68 --> 02:16:37.68
You don't know.

2202
02:16:37.68 --> 02:16:40.68
You don't know what's in it.

2203
02:16:40.68 --> 02:16:42.68
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2204
02:16:41.68 --> 02:16:42.68
And then it's like, well, is that include dark chocolate cake,

2205
02:16:42.68 --> 02:16:44.68
Is that include dark chocolate, triple-flunch ice cream?

2206
02:16:44.68 --> 02:16:45.68
Because is it dark chocolate?

2207
02:16:45.68 --> 02:16:46.68
Is good for you.

2208
02:16:46.68 --> 02:16:47.68
So I'm in the game.

2209
02:16:47.68 --> 02:16:48.68
So sleep is good for me.

2210
02:16:48.68 --> 02:16:49.68
So I'm not getting out of bed.

2211
02:16:49.68 --> 02:16:50.68
Yeah.

2212
02:16:50.68 --> 02:16:54.68
So, but whatever, I, I, I encourage people to sleep.

2213
02:16:54.68 --> 02:16:56.68
And I, it's not, the other thing is that it's crazy.

2214
02:16:56.68 --> 02:16:58.68
It's not like I don't sleep.

2215
02:16:58.68 --> 02:16:59.68
I sleep.

2216
02:16:59.68 --> 02:17:01.68
I sleep almost every day.

2217
02:17:01.68 --> 02:17:04.68
You know what I mean?

2218
02:17:04.68 --> 02:17:05.68
But it's good.

2219
02:17:05.68 --> 02:17:06.68
I don't want my everyday.

2220
02:17:06.68 --> 02:17:08.12
Go on this every day, I sleep.

2221
02:17:08.12 --> 02:17:10.40
No, I see just about every day.

2222
02:17:10.40 --> 02:17:14.96
I go to bed at 10, 10, 30, 11, 11, 30.

2223
02:17:14.96 --> 02:17:16.08
Somewhere in there.

2224
02:17:16.08 --> 02:17:21.08
I wake up at 4, 30, maybe 4, 20, maybe 4, 32.

2225
02:17:22.96 --> 02:17:25.32
But that's a lot of sleep.

2226
02:17:25.32 --> 02:17:29.000
That's between five and six hours every day.

2227
02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:30.80
Yeah, I mean, I guess, for your standards.

2228
02:17:30.80 --> 02:17:33.40
But to people freaking out.

2229
02:17:33.40 --> 02:17:34.88
So no reason.

2230
02:17:34.88 --> 02:17:37.04
Well, I mean, for people who are sleep deprived,

2231
02:17:37.04 --> 02:17:39.64
and they do have differences, which is very interesting.

2232
02:17:39.64 --> 02:17:40.88
OK, this much I do know.

2233
02:17:40.88 --> 02:17:42.12
I do know this for a fact.

2234
02:17:42.12 --> 02:17:45.92
When I have less sleep, I'm more emotional.

2235
02:17:45.92 --> 02:17:46.88
Oh, yeah.

2236
02:17:46.88 --> 02:17:48.80
And you know what?

2237
02:17:48.80 --> 02:17:51.80
I actually, it actually is helpful for me.

2238
02:17:51.80 --> 02:17:52.48
Oh, dang.

2239
02:17:52.48 --> 02:17:52.92
Yeah.

2240
02:17:52.92 --> 02:17:56.12
Like I like to be sleep deprived somewhat.

2241
02:17:56.12 --> 02:17:57.36
I don't know what sessions I say.

2242
02:17:57.36 --> 02:17:58.76
I like to sleep a little bit less,

2243
02:17:58.76 --> 02:18:04.40
because it's more, it makes my life a little bit more

2244
02:18:04.40 --> 02:18:05.72
on edge, which I like.

2245
02:18:05.72 --> 02:18:07.88
Actually, what's fun is you've said that one time.

2246
02:18:07.88 --> 02:18:09.80
When you're like, I like a little bit of sleep depth.

2247
02:18:09.80 --> 02:18:11.16
Just a little bit.

2248
02:18:11.16 --> 02:18:12.36
That was weird when you told me I was like,

2249
02:18:12.36 --> 02:18:15.16
I see where you're saying, because it's almost

2250
02:18:15.16 --> 02:18:16.40
like a comfort thing, right?

2251
02:18:16.40 --> 02:18:17.80
Like if you're too comfortable,

2252
02:18:17.80 --> 02:18:20.16
like you might be more inclined to relax.

2253
02:18:20.16 --> 02:18:22.32
Oh, it was kind of idea.

2254
02:18:22.32 --> 02:18:24.28
Even though, I mean, I can't really get down with it

2255
02:18:24.28 --> 02:18:28.44
because the more stress it, I am the more happy I'm going to feel.

2256
02:18:28.44 --> 02:18:30.48
And you, like, you say emotional.

2257
02:18:30.48 --> 02:18:32.72
And in the book, it's it irritable, right?

2258
02:18:32.72 --> 02:18:34.36
Or something that I think it's the same thing.

2259
02:18:34.36 --> 02:18:35.20
I'm with you.

2260
02:18:35.20 --> 02:18:36.04
I'm with you man.

2261
02:18:36.04 --> 02:18:37.40
Irritable like to kind of like,

2262
02:18:37.40 --> 02:18:41.12
I'm irritable with like stuff, not even like inanimate stuff.

2263
02:18:41.12 --> 02:18:45.16
But I'm like, my phone isn't connected to my Bluetooth.

2264
02:18:45.16 --> 02:18:46.80
And like, car quick enough.

2265
02:18:46.80 --> 02:18:48.92
I'm like, what's wrong with this thing in my head?

2266
02:18:48.92 --> 02:18:51.08
You know, that kind of stuff even.

2267
02:18:51.08 --> 02:18:52.60
But then if I'm rested, bad enough.

2268
02:18:52.60 --> 02:18:54.08
No factor.

2269
02:18:54.08 --> 02:18:55.08
Maybe it won't work at all.

2270
02:18:55.08 --> 02:18:55.92
I'm scared to death.

2271
02:18:55.92 --> 02:18:57.88
So I like that little bit of edge

2272
02:18:57.88 --> 02:19:00.84
because part of it is because things like that never bothered me.

2273
02:19:00.84 --> 02:19:03.12
So I was like, oh, whatever my phone didn't connect.

2274
02:19:03.12 --> 02:19:05.56
So you're kind of dead inside.

2275
02:19:05.56 --> 02:19:06.40
Yeah.

2276
02:19:06.40 --> 02:19:07.56
I'd rather bring it back to life.

2277
02:19:07.56 --> 02:19:09.64
So I'll let you get a little anchor.

2278
02:19:09.64 --> 02:19:11.000
Your ability.

2279
02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.64
Make it good.

2280
02:19:12.64 --> 02:19:17.64
Anyways, that's where I want to stop for this podcast

2281
02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.04
about this book and on the next book.

2282
02:19:21.04 --> 02:19:22.80
And actually this is like the warm up.

2283
02:19:22.80 --> 02:19:26.12
And I think the second half of the book is is even better.

2284
02:19:26.12 --> 02:19:28.04
It's when it gets into the morale.

2285
02:19:28.04 --> 02:19:29.56
It's when it gets into leadership.

2286
02:19:29.56 --> 02:19:32.04
It's when it gets into the psychological warfare,

2287
02:19:32.04 --> 02:19:34.56
offense and defense.

2288
02:19:34.56 --> 02:19:37.80
And so we'll pick that up on the next podcast.

2289
02:19:37.80 --> 02:19:42.84
I want to do one more little passage from this book here.

2290
02:19:42.84 --> 02:19:43.92
It's a shorter passage.

2291
02:19:43.92 --> 02:19:49.36
But it's just again, just a reminder of what

2292
02:19:50.68 --> 02:19:54.60
what war is going back to and we go on

2293
02:19:55.60 --> 02:19:57.24
by Will Bird.

2294
02:19:57.24 --> 02:19:57.92
Here we go.

2295
02:19:57.92 --> 02:20:01.56
We found the cartoon and hardly recognized it.

2296
02:20:01.56 --> 02:20:03.60
The sergeant was there and McDonald,

2297
02:20:03.60 --> 02:20:06.36
but the rest were strangers.

2298
02:20:06.36 --> 02:20:09.80
They told me that the 73rd of the fourth division

2299
02:20:09.80 --> 02:20:13.64
had been so caught up that they had been with Dron

2300
02:20:13.64 --> 02:20:18.28
and the 85th Nova Scotia Highlanders had taken their place.

2301
02:20:18.28 --> 02:20:20.48
The remnant of the 73rd had been divided

2302
02:20:20.48 --> 02:20:23.80
between us and the 13th.

2303
02:20:23.80 --> 02:20:28.20
I got McDonald to one side and asked questions.

2304
02:20:28.20 --> 02:20:31.08
It was far worse than I thought.

2305
02:20:31.08 --> 02:20:35.04
The 42nd had gone straight through to their objective

2306
02:20:35.04 --> 02:20:38.44
despite the slidysnow and mud and confusion

2307
02:20:38.44 --> 02:20:43.76
had driven back all opposition and seized their objective.

2308
02:20:43.76 --> 02:20:45.80
But on their left, the fourth division

2309
02:20:45.80 --> 02:20:51.60
had been held up and a flanking fire had taken a heavy toll.

2310
02:20:51.60 --> 02:20:53.32
Freddy was gone.

2311
02:20:53.32 --> 02:20:56.76
He had predicted truly.

2312
02:20:56.76 --> 02:20:59.88
A big shell had landed beside him, killing him

2313
02:20:59.88 --> 02:21:02.40
and burying him.

2314
02:21:02.40 --> 02:21:07.000
Charlie had fallen in the first rush, riddled with bullets.

2315
02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Joe, the ex-plameesman, had fought through to the objective

2316
02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:15.76
and had been killed by a sniper on the flank.

2317
02:21:15.76 --> 02:21:19.64
One shell had wiped out Stephenson, Therough,

2318
02:21:19.64 --> 02:21:24.44
and Roy as they grouped by a captured gun.

2319
02:21:24.44 --> 02:21:26.52
Mick Millen had been shot in the stomach

2320
02:21:26.52 --> 02:21:30.84
and it died after waiting hours in a trench.

2321
02:21:30.84 --> 02:21:34.12
Billy, the complainer, had fallen as he had charged

2322
02:21:34.12 --> 02:21:36.52
the machine gun, keeping on until he was almost

2323
02:21:36.52 --> 02:21:40.04
within reach of the gunners.

2324
02:21:40.04 --> 02:21:42.92
Little Gil Roy had been killed.

2325
02:21:42.92 --> 02:21:46.16
And Westcott, Smaley, had been wounded.

2326
02:21:49.24 --> 02:21:53.68
Huggy, the sergeant had been defied

2327
02:21:53.68 --> 02:21:55.88
and had been wounded at the same time

2328
02:21:55.88 --> 02:21:58.52
and had been taken away together.

2329
02:21:58.52 --> 02:22:00.68
Big Herman was missing.

2330
02:22:00.68 --> 02:22:04.28
They located his body a month later.

2331
02:22:04.28 --> 02:22:06.48
That morning, he had shaken hands with Freddy,

2332
02:22:06.48 --> 02:22:07.96
said goodbye to him.

2333
02:22:07.96 --> 02:22:13.20
And then when he had got going, had run a muck.

2334
02:22:13.20 --> 02:22:15.16
He was found to almost at the bottom of the ridge

2335
02:22:15.16 --> 02:22:18.28
near a battery position with eight dead Germans

2336
02:22:18.28 --> 02:22:21.56
about him, four of them killed by bayonet.

2337
02:22:21.56 --> 02:22:26.56
And then in the other platoons, besides Tommy,

2338
02:22:26.56 --> 02:22:30.56
Slim and Joe had survived, and Iron Sam,

2339
02:22:30.56 --> 02:22:34.56
and Big Glenn and Eddie, and Mickie and Jerry.

2340
02:22:34.56 --> 02:22:37.56
They sat in the dugout that night

2341
02:22:37.56 --> 02:22:39.56
after a hard day of rebuilding roads,

2342
02:22:39.56 --> 02:22:42.56
each man suffering from bodily fatigue,

2343
02:22:42.56 --> 02:22:44.56
and crawling with vermin,

2344
02:22:44.56 --> 02:22:47.56
and the clammy chill of mud, cate clothing,

2345
02:22:47.56 --> 02:22:49.56
their faces brooding, and agmatic,

2346
02:22:49.56 --> 02:22:52.56
even Mickie's curiously odd,

2347
02:22:52.56 --> 02:22:54.56
only their eyes moving.

2348
02:22:56.56 --> 02:22:58.56
They would not talk about the fighting,

2349
02:22:58.56 --> 02:23:00.56
and seemed utterly worn.

2350
02:23:02.56 --> 02:23:05.56
Six months ago, we had marched eagerly,

2351
02:23:05.56 --> 02:23:08.56
bravely, artin hats a skew,

2352
02:23:08.56 --> 02:23:11.56
and with a cheeky retort for every comment,

2353
02:23:11.56 --> 02:23:14.56
hiding whatever secret apprehensions we had,

2354
02:23:14.56 --> 02:23:16.56
not knowing the heavy ominous silence

2355
02:23:16.56 --> 02:23:19.56
that follows the burst of big shells,

2356
02:23:19.56 --> 02:23:21.56
and the cries of the wounded,

2357
02:23:21.56 --> 02:23:26.56
not knowing what it is to scrape a hasty grave at night,

2358
02:23:26.56 --> 02:23:29.56
and there, bayonet man,

2359
02:23:29.56 --> 02:23:30.56
who has worked with you,

2360
02:23:30.56 --> 02:23:34.56
and slept with you, since you enlisted.

2361
02:23:34.56 --> 02:23:43.56
And clearly, war is hell.

2362
02:23:43.56 --> 02:23:48.56
It's a physical, and it is a psychological hell.

2363
02:23:48.56 --> 02:23:53.56
And the more we know about it,

2364
02:23:53.56 --> 02:23:57.56
the more we should understand that war is to be avoided

2365
02:23:57.56 --> 02:24:00.56
as much as humanly possible.

2366
02:24:00.56 --> 02:24:06.56
But it also teaches us how strong we,

2367
02:24:06.56 --> 02:24:11.56
as human beings, can be what we can overcome.

2368
02:24:11.56 --> 02:24:15.56
It teaches us the importance of training,

2369
02:24:15.56 --> 02:24:17.56
the importance of preparation,

2370
02:24:17.56 --> 02:24:19.56
the importance of will,

2371
02:24:19.56 --> 02:24:23.56
not only the will to win in war,

2372
02:24:23.56 --> 02:24:29.56
but the will to carry on into win in life.

2373
02:24:29.56 --> 02:24:35.56
And we all have that power,

2374
02:24:35.56 --> 02:24:39.56
and we just need to find it.

2375
02:24:39.56 --> 02:24:44.56
And to win.

2376
02:24:44.56 --> 02:24:47.56
And I think that's all I've got tonight,

2377
02:24:47.56 --> 02:24:50.56
so echo Charles,

2378
02:24:50.56 --> 02:24:55.56
speaking of winning.

2379
02:24:55.56 --> 02:25:01.56
I know we are sort of trying to be on the path of winning mentally,

2380
02:25:01.56 --> 02:25:04.56
physically, psychologically, in life,

2381
02:25:04.56 --> 02:25:07.56
and on the mats.

2382
02:25:07.56 --> 02:25:11.56
And I know that's sort of the thing we're doing here,

2383
02:25:11.56 --> 02:25:13.56
the movement.

2384
02:25:13.56 --> 02:25:16.56
And I know you have some recommendations for that.

2385
02:25:16.56 --> 02:25:17.56
Yes, my be helpful.

2386
02:25:17.56 --> 02:25:19.56
Yes, they will be helpful.

2387
02:25:19.56 --> 02:25:21.56
Oh, actually.

2388
02:25:21.56 --> 02:25:22.56
Nice, nice.

2389
02:25:22.56 --> 02:25:23.56
What do you got?

2390
02:25:23.56 --> 02:25:25.56
I have, well, we're on the path, right?

2391
02:25:25.56 --> 02:25:26.56
We've got that.

2392
02:25:26.56 --> 02:25:27.56
Wait, war.

2393
02:25:27.56 --> 02:25:28.56
Life is war.

2394
02:25:28.56 --> 02:25:29.56
We're asshole.

2395
02:25:29.56 --> 02:25:30.56
What is it for?

2396
02:25:30.56 --> 02:25:31.56
We're all at war.

2397
02:25:31.56 --> 02:25:33.56
Yeah, all at war.

2398
02:25:33.56 --> 02:25:34.56
All at war.

2399
02:25:34.56 --> 02:25:37.56
Now, total war.

2400
02:25:37.56 --> 02:25:38.56
Total war.

2401
02:25:38.56 --> 02:25:39.56
That's what we're looking for.

2402
02:25:39.56 --> 02:25:40.56
Yes, total war.

2403
02:25:40.56 --> 02:25:42.56
So we're being that total war.

2404
02:25:42.56 --> 02:25:44.56
There's little battles.

2405
02:25:44.56 --> 02:25:47.56
I think people are not going to like that.

2406
02:25:47.56 --> 02:25:48.56
What?

2407
02:25:48.56 --> 02:25:49.56
Life is war.

2408
02:25:49.56 --> 02:25:50.56
But it's so true.

2409
02:25:50.56 --> 02:25:51.56
Yeah, I mean,

2410
02:25:51.56 --> 02:25:54.56
if you start looking at your life,

2411
02:25:54.56 --> 02:25:55.56
like it's war,

2412
02:25:55.56 --> 02:25:56.56
that's going to make you better.

2413
02:25:56.56 --> 02:25:57.56
Yeah.

2414
02:25:57.56 --> 02:26:00.56
If you look at everyday as a war,

2415
02:26:00.56 --> 02:26:03.56
on multiple fronts that you have to fight,

2416
02:26:03.56 --> 02:26:07.56
you know, where victory is the only choice you're going to have a better life.

2417
02:26:07.56 --> 02:26:08.56
Actually, it's really good.

2418
02:26:08.56 --> 02:26:10.56
Even for someone who look,

2419
02:26:10.56 --> 02:26:11.56
I get it.

2420
02:26:11.56 --> 02:26:13.56
The word war might trigger some people.

2421
02:26:13.56 --> 02:26:14.56
I get it.

2422
02:26:14.56 --> 02:26:15.56
Just like the word fight might trigger some people,

2423
02:26:15.56 --> 02:26:16.56
but you could say,

2424
02:26:16.56 --> 02:26:17.56
life is a fight.

2425
02:26:17.56 --> 02:26:18.56
It's always a fight.

2426
02:26:18.56 --> 02:26:19.56
Not against people.

2427
02:26:19.56 --> 02:26:22.56
My suspicion is the amount of people

2428
02:26:22.56 --> 02:26:25.56
listening to this podcast that is triggered by the word to war.

2429
02:26:25.56 --> 02:26:27.56
Or fight is zero.

2430
02:26:27.56 --> 02:26:28.56
Zero, yes.

2431
02:26:28.56 --> 02:26:29.56
I agree with you.

2432
02:26:29.56 --> 02:26:30.56
That's my suspicion.

2433
02:26:30.56 --> 02:26:30.56
Yeah.

2434
02:26:30.56 --> 02:26:31.56
I could be wrong.

2435
02:26:31.56 --> 02:26:33.56
But they're severely triggered at this point.

2436
02:26:33.56 --> 02:26:35.56
If that's where they're at.

2437
02:26:35.56 --> 02:26:38.56
So the only thing we talk about is fighting in war.

2438
02:26:38.56 --> 02:26:40.56
Yes, I think you're right.

2439
02:26:40.56 --> 02:26:41.56
I believe.

2440
02:26:41.56 --> 02:26:42.56
Okay.

2441
02:26:42.56 --> 02:26:43.56
You're right.

2442
02:26:43.56 --> 02:26:45.56
So within the,

2443
02:26:45.56 --> 02:26:47.56
all out war, there's little battles.

2444
02:26:47.56 --> 02:26:48.56
Right.

2445
02:26:48.56 --> 02:26:50.56
And in those battles,

2446
02:26:50.56 --> 02:26:54.56
one of those battles is the jujitsu.

2447
02:26:54.56 --> 02:26:57.56
When you do the jujitsu,

2448
02:26:57.56 --> 02:26:58.56
you're going to need a key.

2449
02:26:58.56 --> 02:26:59.56
Anirash card.

2450
02:26:59.56 --> 02:27:00.56
Just to begin.

2451
02:27:00.56 --> 02:27:01.56
That's what I think.

2452
02:27:01.56 --> 02:27:04.56
So actually technically you could wear basketball shorts on a tank top.

2453
02:27:04.56 --> 02:27:05.56
You could not recommend it.

2454
02:27:05.56 --> 02:27:06.56
Not recommend it.

2455
02:27:06.56 --> 02:27:07.56
Especially the basketball shorts.

2456
02:27:07.56 --> 02:27:08.56
Yeah.

2457
02:27:08.56 --> 02:27:09.56
They will be pulled down.

2458
02:27:09.56 --> 02:27:12.56
Pulled down, pulled up, caught on people's toes.

2459
02:27:12.56 --> 02:27:13.56
Yeah.

2460
02:27:13.56 --> 02:27:15.56
Sometimes just not a good plan.

2461
02:27:15.56 --> 02:27:17.56
Not as good as like, yeah.

2462
02:27:17.56 --> 02:27:20.56
Maybe some board shorts because they don't as far as,

2463
02:27:20.56 --> 02:27:21.56
yeah.

2464
02:27:21.56 --> 02:27:23.56
Nonetheless, this is where you get these things from.

2465
02:27:23.56 --> 02:27:24.56
Origin.

2466
02:27:24.56 --> 02:27:25.56
Origin main.com.

2467
02:27:25.56 --> 02:27:26.56
That's where you go.

2468
02:27:26.56 --> 02:27:28.56
Get a rash card.

2469
02:27:28.56 --> 02:27:29.56
Get a geek.

2470
02:27:29.56 --> 02:27:32.56
Basky in the world, factually, by the way.

2471
02:27:32.56 --> 02:27:34.56
Also happens to be made in America.

2472
02:27:34.56 --> 02:27:36.56
Are they the best because they're made in America?

2473
02:27:36.56 --> 02:27:37.56
Maybe, maybe not.

2474
02:27:37.56 --> 02:27:38.56
Mmhm.

2475
02:27:38.56 --> 02:27:40.56
But those are two separate ways.

2476
02:27:40.56 --> 02:27:41.56
Oh yeah.

2477
02:27:41.56 --> 02:27:42.56
Basky is in the world.

2478
02:27:42.56 --> 02:27:45.56
Many different options are also rash cards.

2479
02:27:45.56 --> 02:27:47.56
Like I said, also joggers.

2480
02:27:47.56 --> 02:27:48.56
Yeah.

2481
02:27:48.56 --> 02:27:50.56
Like I said before.

2482
02:27:50.56 --> 02:27:52.56
But yeah, a lot of clothes.

2483
02:27:52.56 --> 02:27:53.56
A pair of clothes.

2484
02:27:53.56 --> 02:27:55.56
What you're missing is jeans.

2485
02:27:55.56 --> 02:27:56.56
Yes.

2486
02:27:56.56 --> 02:27:57.56
There are jeans.

2487
02:27:57.56 --> 02:27:58.56
Yeah.

2488
02:27:58.56 --> 02:27:59.56
Wait, can we get jeans now?

2489
02:27:59.56 --> 02:28:01.56
We should be getting jeans now.

2490
02:28:01.56 --> 02:28:03.56
I know I have Origin jeans.

2491
02:28:03.56 --> 02:28:06.56
I know I'm in a little bit of a preferred scenario.

2492
02:28:06.56 --> 02:28:07.56
Well, yes.

2493
02:28:07.56 --> 02:28:08.56
I know people.

2494
02:28:08.56 --> 02:28:09.56
Yeah.

2495
02:28:09.56 --> 02:28:11.56
So I was going to say, wait, if we can all get jeans.

2496
02:28:11.56 --> 02:28:13.56
No, that's interesting because I didn't get jeans.

2497
02:28:13.56 --> 02:28:14.56
Yeah.

2498
02:28:14.56 --> 02:28:17.56
Well, the jeans are being made at this time.

2499
02:28:17.56 --> 02:28:18.56
Yeah.

2500
02:28:18.56 --> 02:28:20.56
So they're available.

2501
02:28:20.56 --> 02:28:21.56
We'll say.

2502
02:28:21.56 --> 02:28:22.56
I'm American denim.

2503
02:28:22.56 --> 02:28:24.56
American made.

2504
02:28:24.56 --> 02:28:25.56
Best jeans ever.

2505
02:28:25.56 --> 02:28:26.56
Obviously.

2506
02:28:26.56 --> 02:28:27.56
Obviously.

2507
02:28:27.56 --> 02:28:29.56
And yeah, check them out.

2508
02:28:29.56 --> 02:28:30.56
Yeah.

2509
02:28:30.56 --> 02:28:31.56
Orgy made.

2510
02:28:31.56 --> 02:28:32.56
Also supplements.

2511
02:28:32.56 --> 02:28:34.56
Best kind of supplements.

2512
02:28:34.56 --> 02:28:46.56
So I can't come to the conclusion that the harsh conclusion and that exercise generally speaking is probably the best thing you can do for yourself.

2513
02:28:46.56 --> 02:28:47.56
Okay.

2514
02:28:47.56 --> 02:28:50.56
Generally speaking, I'm not saying there's no exceptions.

2515
02:28:50.56 --> 02:28:51.56
I'm not saying that.

2516
02:28:51.56 --> 02:28:52.56
Yep.

2517
02:28:52.56 --> 02:28:56.56
And you're not saying that throw everything else into the dumpster.

2518
02:28:56.56 --> 02:28:56.56
Correct.

2519
02:28:56.56 --> 02:28:56.56
Yes.

2520
02:28:56.56 --> 02:28:59.56
So when it comes to supplements, okay.

2521
02:28:59.56 --> 02:29:02.56
So what's the best kind of supplements to take then?

2522
02:29:02.56 --> 02:29:06.56
If we understand that exercise is the best thing you can do for yourself.

2523
02:29:06.56 --> 02:29:07.56
What kind of supplements?

2524
02:29:07.56 --> 02:29:10.56
Is it like a muscle building supplements?

2525
02:29:10.56 --> 02:29:12.56
Or is it?

2526
02:29:12.56 --> 02:29:14.56
This is what I'm asking myself as I'm driving.

2527
02:29:14.56 --> 02:29:16.56
Because I drive some.

2528
02:29:16.56 --> 02:29:25.56
Or is it the kind of supplement that allows you to stay able to exercise at full capacity longer?

2529
02:29:25.56 --> 02:29:26.56
Probably those right?

2530
02:29:26.56 --> 02:29:27.56
I know what you think.

2531
02:29:27.56 --> 02:29:28.56
Yeah.

2532
02:29:28.56 --> 02:29:29.56
Yeah.

2533
02:29:29.56 --> 02:29:31.56
You like the joint warfare, acrylic oil.

2534
02:29:31.56 --> 02:29:32.56
Yes, sir.

2535
02:29:32.56 --> 02:29:34.56
You like the discipline.

2536
02:29:34.56 --> 02:29:35.56
Right.

2537
02:29:35.56 --> 02:29:38.56
Because I say this because it's not just intuitive.

2538
02:29:38.56 --> 02:29:42.56
You think supplements give my body bigger or whatever stronger.

2539
02:29:42.56 --> 02:29:46.56
But what if you do want to get more yoke to let's say how much you get some of that more?

2540
02:29:46.56 --> 02:29:50.56
The like you said, we don't throw everything else into the dumpster.

2541
02:29:50.56 --> 02:29:54.56
I'm just saying this is, you just say, I go in the road and I eating whatever.

2542
02:29:54.56 --> 02:29:56.56
And when I go on the road, I go on the trip.

2543
02:29:56.56 --> 02:30:00.56
I usually really good because I go on to a steak restaurant and I get rib eyes.

2544
02:30:00.56 --> 02:30:01.56
Yes, sir.

2545
02:30:01.56 --> 02:30:03.56
No matter what when I come home, I want to have more.

2546
02:30:03.56 --> 02:30:05.56
Yeah, I could have that mid-chalkochip mold.

2547
02:30:05.56 --> 02:30:06.56
Because it's like a dessert.

2548
02:30:06.56 --> 02:30:07.56
Boy, this is a dessert.

2549
02:30:07.56 --> 02:30:08.56
It's a dessert.

2550
02:30:08.56 --> 02:30:10.56
Without the guilt.

2551
02:30:10.56 --> 02:30:12.56
We actually crap.

2552
02:30:12.56 --> 02:30:13.56
Yeah.

2553
02:30:13.56 --> 02:30:15.56
That's literally good for you.

2554
02:30:15.56 --> 02:30:16.56
Yeah.

2555
02:30:16.56 --> 02:30:18.56
How can you get a dessert that's actually good for you?

2556
02:30:18.56 --> 02:30:19.56
I'll tell you how.

2557
02:30:19.56 --> 02:30:20.56
You go to originmate.com.

2558
02:30:20.56 --> 02:30:21.56
You get milk.

2559
02:30:21.56 --> 02:30:25.56
Kids.

2560
02:30:25.56 --> 02:30:28.56
Is it a feeding kids junk?

2561
02:30:28.56 --> 02:30:30.56
That's horrible for them.

2562
02:30:30.56 --> 02:30:31.56
You get them some more.

2563
02:30:31.56 --> 02:30:32.56
Your kid milk.

2564
02:30:32.56 --> 02:30:36.56
You will have kids that want to drink something that's awesome for them.

2565
02:30:36.56 --> 02:30:37.56
Yep.

2566
02:30:37.56 --> 02:30:40.56
And by the time it's a meal, by the way, they will be stoked to get your kid some more.

2567
02:30:40.56 --> 02:30:43.56
Your kid milk tasty.

2568
02:30:43.56 --> 02:30:46.56
People who are asking about what the strawberry adult milk is coming out.

2569
02:30:46.56 --> 02:30:48.56
I don't, I don't, I don't be little.

2570
02:30:48.56 --> 02:30:49.56
Do not mess this up.

2571
02:30:49.56 --> 02:30:51.56
I'm like, little.

2572
02:30:51.56 --> 02:30:53.56
The strawberry kids milk is epic.

2573
02:30:53.56 --> 02:30:54.56
It's epic.

2574
02:30:54.56 --> 02:30:55.56
Yeah.

2575
02:30:55.56 --> 02:31:01.56
I said, if you mess up and the adult strawberry milk is an epic, we're going to have an

2576
02:31:01.56 --> 02:31:03.56
issue.

2577
02:31:03.56 --> 02:31:04.56
It's a problem.

2578
02:31:04.56 --> 02:31:07.56
So be little on the case.

2579
02:31:07.56 --> 02:31:08.56
Yeah.

2580
02:31:08.56 --> 02:31:09.56
Well, he's on the case.

2581
02:31:09.56 --> 02:31:10.56
Yeah, man.

2582
02:31:10.56 --> 02:31:11.56
It's true.

2583
02:31:11.56 --> 02:31:12.56
Also, joc was a store.

2584
02:31:12.56 --> 02:31:14.56
It's called jocos store.

2585
02:31:14.56 --> 02:31:16.56
So go to jocos store.com.

2586
02:31:16.56 --> 02:31:18.56
This is where you can get.

2587
02:31:18.56 --> 02:31:21.56
Shirts, hoodies, restaurants.

2588
02:31:21.56 --> 02:31:22.56
More rashguards.

2589
02:31:22.56 --> 02:31:26.56
All representative of this path that we're on.

2590
02:31:26.56 --> 02:31:27.56
And we're on the path.

2591
02:31:27.56 --> 02:31:28.56
Certainly.

2592
02:31:28.56 --> 02:31:29.56
And we're going to stay on the path.

2593
02:31:29.56 --> 02:31:32.56
We just stay on the path until the path path ends and guess what?

2594
02:31:32.56 --> 02:31:34.56
The little answer to that little little.

2595
02:31:34.56 --> 02:31:35.56
That little little path doesn't hit.

2596
02:31:35.56 --> 02:31:36.56
That does.

2597
02:31:36.56 --> 02:31:40.56
So if you want to represent jocos store.com, got some new stuff on there by the way.

2598
02:31:40.56 --> 02:31:43.56
Well, a little new design of the hoodies.

2599
02:31:43.56 --> 02:31:45.56
You know, it's a little really like that one.

2600
02:31:45.56 --> 02:31:48.56
None of the let's hey, look, go check it out.

2601
02:31:48.56 --> 02:31:49.56
If you like something.

2602
02:31:49.56 --> 02:31:50.56
Trock it or something.

2603
02:31:50.56 --> 02:31:51.56
Trunks.

2604
02:31:51.56 --> 02:31:52.56
Stickers.

2605
02:31:52.56 --> 02:31:53.56
There's some.

2606
02:31:53.56 --> 02:31:55.56
Yeah, but there's bumper sticks on there.

2607
02:31:55.56 --> 02:31:56.56
This patches on there.

2608
02:31:56.56 --> 02:31:57.56
There's more.

2609
02:31:57.56 --> 02:31:59.56
I just designed a new rashguard.

2610
02:31:59.56 --> 02:32:01.56
It's not like totally new with a new rashguard.

2611
02:32:01.56 --> 02:32:02.56
Okay.

2612
02:32:02.56 --> 02:32:03.56
Sent it to Pete.

2613
02:32:03.56 --> 02:32:04.56
We're getting it done.

2614
02:32:04.56 --> 02:32:05.56
It should be there.

2615
02:32:05.56 --> 02:32:06.56
And you know, within the week.

2616
02:32:06.56 --> 02:32:08.56
Also, I know where you talk.

2617
02:32:08.56 --> 02:32:10.56
A lot of trashed me about light weight.

2618
02:32:10.56 --> 02:32:11.56
He's there.

2619
02:32:11.56 --> 02:32:12.56
We're going to do a light weight.

2620
02:32:12.56 --> 02:32:13.56
100%.

2621
02:32:13.56 --> 02:32:14.56
It's in the pipe.

2622
02:32:14.56 --> 02:32:14.56
Okay.

2623
02:32:14.56 --> 02:32:15.56
Jockel unapproved.

2624
02:32:15.56 --> 02:32:18.56
But when you see it, it's going to be approved.

2625
02:32:18.56 --> 02:32:20.56
Anyway, if you like something gets on.

2626
02:32:20.56 --> 02:32:23.56
If I was going to wear a light weight hoodie, I would just wear a t-shirt.

2627
02:32:23.56 --> 02:32:24.56
Bro.

2628
02:32:24.56 --> 02:32:25.56
Yeah, I did it.

2629
02:32:25.56 --> 02:32:28.56
But some of us, you know, we like that there's like this little intermediary

2630
02:32:28.56 --> 02:32:33.56
Puzzah situation where it's not hot.

2631
02:32:33.56 --> 02:32:36.56
It's cold, but it's not cold cold.

2632
02:32:36.56 --> 02:32:39.56
You don't like when the wind blows consistently.

2633
02:32:39.56 --> 02:32:43.56
And you're like, you know, I could only buy the grace of decentralized command.

2634
02:32:43.56 --> 02:32:45.56
That this is happening.

2635
02:32:45.56 --> 02:32:46.56
Yes.

2636
02:32:46.56 --> 02:32:51.56
Because despite what you're saying to me, a medium or whatever you said, a light weight hoodie

2637
02:32:51.56 --> 02:32:55.56
makes no logical sense to me as a human.

2638
02:32:55.56 --> 02:32:56.56
What?

2639
02:32:56.56 --> 02:32:58.56
You know, that's one of the many differences between me and you.

2640
02:32:58.56 --> 02:33:02.56
And I think that there are a lot of people out there who support me on this decision.

2641
02:33:02.56 --> 02:33:07.56
Which is what we will track and see if anyone buys light weight hoodie.

2642
02:33:07.56 --> 02:33:09.56
Going to the numbers.

2643
02:33:09.56 --> 02:33:10.56
Okay.

2644
02:33:10.56 --> 02:33:13.56
And also there's women's double present them to the people.

2645
02:33:13.56 --> 02:33:14.56
Yeah.

2646
02:33:14.56 --> 02:33:15.56
Cool. Well, there it is.

2647
02:33:15.56 --> 02:33:15.56
Yeah.

2648
02:33:15.56 --> 02:33:19.56
Anyway, jockelstore.com. There's some women's stuff on there that it's this cool stuff.

2649
02:33:19.56 --> 02:33:20.56
You've like something to get some.

2650
02:33:20.56 --> 02:33:22.56
It's a good way to represent for sure.

2651
02:33:22.56 --> 02:33:24.56
Also, jockel white tea.

2652
02:33:24.56 --> 02:33:25.56
Mm-hmm.

2653
02:33:25.56 --> 02:33:28.56
If you want to deadlift 8000 pounds, if you're not already.

2654
02:33:28.56 --> 02:33:30.56
Okay. This is the reason or one of the reasons.

2655
02:33:30.56 --> 02:33:32.56
Unless you're already a tea drinker.

2656
02:33:32.56 --> 02:33:35.56
Even if you're not a teacher, because that wasn't a teacher in the night.

2657
02:33:35.56 --> 02:33:36.56
Jockel white tea.

2658
02:33:36.56 --> 02:33:37.56
So I am a teacher in Karte.

2659
02:33:37.56 --> 02:33:38.56
Technically.

2660
02:33:38.56 --> 02:33:40.56
This is the original.

2661
02:33:40.56 --> 02:33:42.56
This is like the first thing.

2662
02:33:42.56 --> 02:33:43.56
What?

2663
02:33:43.56 --> 02:33:44.56
How am I to make something?

2664
02:33:44.56 --> 02:33:45.56
I'm going to make this tea.

2665
02:33:45.56 --> 02:33:46.56
Oh, the first thing.

2666
02:33:46.56 --> 02:33:47.56
Oh, the first thing.

2667
02:33:47.56 --> 02:33:48.56
The first thing.

2668
02:33:48.56 --> 02:33:49.56
The OG product.

2669
02:33:49.56 --> 02:33:50.56
Yeah.

2670
02:33:50.56 --> 02:33:51.56
I had some on the way over here.

2671
02:33:51.56 --> 02:33:52.56
Yeah.

2672
02:33:52.56 --> 02:33:53.56
You know what's funny, man?

2673
02:33:53.56 --> 02:33:55.56
Because I was a little bit chilly.

2674
02:33:55.56 --> 02:33:56.56
I wanted some warm tea.

2675
02:33:56.56 --> 02:33:58.56
I could have used a little light weight hoodie.

2676
02:33:58.56 --> 02:33:59.56
I could have used a little light weight hoodie.

2677
02:33:59.56 --> 02:34:01.56
I could have used a little light weight hoodie.

2678
02:34:01.56 --> 02:34:02.56
I could have used a little light weight hoodie.

2679
02:34:02.56 --> 02:34:06.56
Anyway, it's interesting how all these products is all stuff that you use.

2680
02:34:06.56 --> 02:34:10.56
So you're like, you're like walking, not walking, but you're just sort of existing.

2681
02:34:10.56 --> 02:34:13.56
You're like, instead of like, you know, getting this stuff, let me just make it.

2682
02:34:13.56 --> 02:34:16.56
So it, and it turns out, like, you make all your own stuff.

2683
02:34:16.56 --> 02:34:20.56
Well, the thing is, if you're going to, I'm picky.

2684
02:34:20.56 --> 02:34:21.56
That's my problem.

2685
02:34:21.56 --> 02:34:23.56
I'm picky about what I like and what I don't like.

2686
02:34:23.56 --> 02:34:24.56
Yeah.

2687
02:34:24.56 --> 02:34:27.56
And so yeah, well, I'm straightforward, but I'm picky.

2688
02:34:27.56 --> 02:34:29.56
I want this specific thing a specific way.

2689
02:34:29.56 --> 02:34:32.56
And you can't buy what I want or you couldn't.

2690
02:34:32.56 --> 02:34:33.56
Right.

2691
02:34:33.56 --> 02:34:34.56
You couldn't buy what I want.

2692
02:34:34.56 --> 02:34:35.56
Now you can.

2693
02:34:35.56 --> 02:34:37.56
This is what I want.

2694
02:34:37.56 --> 02:34:38.56
It makes sense.

2695
02:34:38.56 --> 02:34:39.56
It's like everything.

2696
02:34:39.56 --> 02:34:42.56
Like the jit like victory MMA and fitness are gym.

2697
02:34:42.56 --> 02:34:43.56
Yeah.

2698
02:34:43.56 --> 02:34:43.56
Why is that?

2699
02:34:43.56 --> 02:34:44.56
Why does it exist?

2700
02:34:44.56 --> 02:34:47.56
Because we want it to have the way we want things to be.

2701
02:34:47.56 --> 02:34:51.56
You can't just, you can't go to someone else's gym and expect it to be the way you want it.

2702
02:34:51.56 --> 02:34:52.56
Yeah.

2703
02:34:52.56 --> 02:34:56.56
You can't buy some supplement off the shelf and expect it to taste the way you want it to taste.

2704
02:34:56.56 --> 02:35:03.56
It's going to taste the way some random person in some other area.

2705
02:35:03.56 --> 02:35:05.56
You can't just want it to taste.

2706
02:35:05.56 --> 02:35:07.56
They don't know what tastes good.

2707
02:35:07.56 --> 02:35:09.56
Well, and they're going to take one.

2708
02:35:09.56 --> 02:35:14.56
Let's say figure that it's putting it there just trying to make the maximum profit margin.

2709
02:35:14.56 --> 02:35:17.56
So they're putting filer in whatever.

2710
02:35:17.56 --> 02:35:18.56
Yeah.

2711
02:35:18.56 --> 02:35:19.56
So it exists.

2712
02:35:19.56 --> 02:35:20.56
Make totally mix.

2713
02:35:20.56 --> 02:35:26.56
If you're going to make something, then if you have to, if you want to use something, why not make it the way you want it.

2714
02:35:26.56 --> 02:35:27.56
Origen jeans, by the way.

2715
02:35:27.56 --> 02:35:28.56
Same thing.

2716
02:35:28.56 --> 02:35:29.56
Yeah.

2717
02:35:29.56 --> 02:35:33.56
So the way I want them to be made, the way Pete likes or make.

2718
02:35:33.56 --> 02:35:34.56
Yeah.

2719
02:35:34.56 --> 02:35:36.56
You know, in America.

2720
02:35:36.56 --> 02:35:38.56
So anyway, yeah, that's how we end up doing this stuff.

2721
02:35:38.56 --> 02:35:39.56
Boom.

2722
02:35:39.56 --> 02:35:40.56
Yeah.

2723
02:35:40.56 --> 02:35:41.56
Good.

2724
02:35:41.56 --> 02:35:42.56
I'm glad you did it by the way.

2725
02:35:42.56 --> 02:35:44.56
Oh, and there's some people.

2726
02:35:44.56 --> 02:35:47.56
We joked about subscribing to the podcast.

2727
02:35:47.56 --> 02:35:54.56
I saw some comments that people didn't hadn't subscribed to the podcast until the last show.

2728
02:35:54.56 --> 02:36:00.56
This dude was like, I listened to a hundred and see 63 episodes and I never subscribed to the podcast.

2729
02:36:00.56 --> 02:36:06.56
Until you said and joked about who would listen to a hundred and 63 episodes and not subscribed to the podcast.

2730
02:36:06.56 --> 02:36:09.56
And he said, that was me.

2731
02:36:09.56 --> 02:36:17.56
So there might be one other person out there that hasn't subscribed to the podcast or hasn't subscribed to the YouTube channel.

2732
02:36:17.56 --> 02:36:20.56
Or hasn't subscribed to the Warrior Kid podcast.

2733
02:36:20.56 --> 02:36:25.56
So if you haven't subscribed to those things, do so.

2734
02:36:25.56 --> 02:36:27.56
Wait, what do you mean you stand corrected?

2735
02:36:27.56 --> 02:36:31.56
You're the one that always says like there might be someone that's an I didn't believe you.

2736
02:36:31.56 --> 02:36:34.56
I think I don't know if I'd ever say for subscribing.

2737
02:36:34.56 --> 02:36:35.56
But it was.

2738
02:36:35.56 --> 02:36:36.56
Yes.

2739
02:36:36.56 --> 02:36:40.56
I always said or feel that it seems obvious.

2740
02:36:40.56 --> 02:36:41.56
Yes.

2741
02:36:41.56 --> 02:36:42.56
Subscribe.

2742
02:36:42.56 --> 02:36:43.56
But subscribe.

2743
02:36:43.56 --> 02:36:46.56
And I always thought that that was dumb.

2744
02:36:46.56 --> 02:36:51.56
Yeah. And I thought to myself, who could listen to this podcast over and over again and not subscribe to it?

2745
02:36:51.56 --> 02:36:53.56
But that rubbed off on me and I started to feel that way.

2746
02:36:53.56 --> 02:36:56.56
In fact, because right now I'm trying to search my feelings and I do feel that way.

2747
02:36:56.56 --> 02:36:59.56
Like, yeah, why are you telling people to subscribe?

2748
02:36:59.56 --> 02:37:00.56
So we don't even know anyone.

2749
02:37:00.56 --> 02:37:05.56
But now what I'm saying is we got reports back from the field of people that didn't subscribe yet.

2750
02:37:05.56 --> 02:37:08.56
162 podcasts deep.

2751
02:37:08.56 --> 02:37:09.56
Huh.

2752
02:37:09.56 --> 02:37:13.56
And now we're 164 podcasts. If you haven't subscribed to the podcast, subscribe.

2753
02:37:13.56 --> 02:37:18.56
If you check out the YouTube channel, by the way, the YouTube channel echoes videos around there.

2754
02:37:18.56 --> 02:37:20.56
He's real proud of him.

2755
02:37:20.56 --> 02:37:23.56
He's a kid from the world.

2756
02:37:23.56 --> 02:37:25.56
He's real proud of him.

2757
02:37:25.56 --> 02:37:27.56
He puts little things explode.

2758
02:37:27.56 --> 02:37:29.56
Some people think it's too much.

2759
02:37:29.56 --> 02:37:31.56
Well, some people think it's too much.

2760
02:37:31.56 --> 02:37:33.56
Sometimes they're sometimes they're.

2761
02:37:33.56 --> 02:37:34.56
Sometimes they're right in there.

2762
02:37:34.56 --> 02:37:35.56
It's a dichotomy.

2763
02:37:35.56 --> 02:37:36.56
You got a balance in dichotomy.

2764
02:37:36.56 --> 02:37:37.56
No.

2765
02:37:37.56 --> 02:37:39.56
No effects too many effects.

2766
02:37:39.56 --> 02:37:44.56
Yeah, well, it's there's varying levels of appropriateness with effects.

2767
02:37:44.56 --> 02:37:45.56
Yeah.

2768
02:37:45.56 --> 02:37:48.56
So at some point, I want you to purposely make a video that's completely.

2769
02:37:48.56 --> 02:37:51.56
You take whatever I've said on this podcast.

2770
02:37:51.56 --> 02:37:52.56
That's over the top anyways.

2771
02:37:52.56 --> 02:37:53.56
Yeah.

2772
02:37:53.56 --> 02:37:55.56
And you just make the most over the top video.

2773
02:37:55.56 --> 02:37:56.56
That is a good idea.

2774
02:37:56.56 --> 02:38:02.56
I remember one time I said, don't sleep eat steak train her or something like that.

2775
02:38:02.56 --> 02:38:04.56
That's what that's what the video should be.

2776
02:38:04.56 --> 02:38:10.56
To be about that, just guys with broken legs crawling out on the mat with a steak hanging out of the mouth.

2777
02:38:10.56 --> 02:38:14.56
You know, like that kind of thing over the top, everything exploding.

2778
02:38:14.56 --> 02:38:15.56
A fire.

2779
02:38:15.56 --> 02:38:17.56
Because a lot of times your explosions don't have fire.

2780
02:38:17.56 --> 02:38:19.56
A lot of times they're just smoking more.

2781
02:38:19.56 --> 02:38:21.56
More like smoking dust.

2782
02:38:21.56 --> 02:38:22.56
Yeah.

2783
02:38:22.56 --> 02:38:23.56
You keep it dark.

2784
02:38:23.56 --> 02:38:29.56
Yeah, there's explosions more just like just like various levels of destruction.

2785
02:38:29.56 --> 02:38:31.56
What is it?

2786
02:38:31.56 --> 02:38:34.56
So check that out.

2787
02:38:34.56 --> 02:38:40.56
Check out the warrior kid soap and Irish Oaks Ranch.com young eight and making or your kids soap.

2788
02:38:40.56 --> 02:38:43.56
Check out psychological warfare.

2789
02:38:43.56 --> 02:38:50.56
Little kid bits of information to help you overcome momentary weakness.

2790
02:38:50.56 --> 02:38:52.56
I'll tell you how to do it.

2791
02:38:52.56 --> 02:38:54.56
It's not real complicated.

2792
02:38:54.56 --> 02:38:55.56
Yeah.

2793
02:38:55.56 --> 02:38:56.56
But it is effective.

2794
02:38:56.56 --> 02:38:57.56
Yeah.

2795
02:38:57.56 --> 02:38:58.56
Check.

2796
02:38:58.56 --> 02:38:59.56
Amazon music to see if you can get it.

2797
02:38:59.56 --> 02:39:00.56
Yeah.

2798
02:39:00.56 --> 02:39:01.56
I'm going to do by MP3.

2799
02:39:01.56 --> 02:39:03.56
That's really that's called psychological warfare.

2800
02:39:03.56 --> 02:39:04.56
It's a good one.

2801
02:39:04.56 --> 02:39:08.56
Very much so also you want to subscribe to the warrior kid podcast.

2802
02:39:08.56 --> 02:39:09.56
I said that.

2803
02:39:09.56 --> 02:39:11.56
I'm glad you're emphasizing it though.

2804
02:39:11.56 --> 02:39:12.56
Well.

2805
02:39:12.56 --> 02:39:13.56
Yeah.

2806
02:39:13.56 --> 02:39:14.56
I thought you didn't say that.

2807
02:39:14.56 --> 02:39:15.56
Okay.

2808
02:39:15.56 --> 02:39:16.56
I think I missed that.

2809
02:39:16.56 --> 02:39:17.56
That's nice.

2810
02:39:17.56 --> 02:39:18.56
Nonetheless, yeah, yeah.

2811
02:39:18.56 --> 02:39:19.56
It's a good one.

2812
02:39:19.56 --> 02:39:20.56
That's a good one for you and the kids.

2813
02:39:20.56 --> 02:39:21.56
Both of you guys.

2814
02:39:21.56 --> 02:39:22.56
They're there.

2815
02:39:22.56 --> 02:39:24.56
Good lessons, but they're super basic.

2816
02:39:24.56 --> 02:39:25.56
Just like this.

2817
02:39:25.56 --> 02:39:26.56
Just like this bookman.

2818
02:39:26.56 --> 02:39:27.56
Very much so.

2819
02:39:27.56 --> 02:39:28.56
Also.

2820
02:39:28.56 --> 02:39:29.56
On it.

2821
02:39:29.56 --> 02:39:30.56
On it dot com.

2822
02:39:30.56 --> 02:39:31.56
Go there slash.

2823
02:39:31.56 --> 02:39:33.56
Go on it dot com slash.

2824
02:39:33.56 --> 02:39:35.56
This is where you can get kettlebells.

2825
02:39:35.56 --> 02:39:37.56
Add to your home gym.

2826
02:39:37.56 --> 02:39:39.56
Add to your capability.

2827
02:39:39.56 --> 02:39:40.56
Rings.

2828
02:39:40.56 --> 02:39:41.56
Add to that capability.

2829
02:39:41.56 --> 02:39:42.56
I just got some.

2830
02:39:42.56 --> 02:39:43.56
The storm trooper.

2831
02:39:43.56 --> 02:39:44.56
One.

2832
02:39:44.56 --> 02:39:45.56
Star Wars.

2833
02:39:45.56 --> 02:39:46.56
Straight up.

2834
02:39:46.56 --> 02:39:47.56
Brad, don't hate on that.

2835
02:39:47.56 --> 02:39:48.56
Rises.

2836
02:39:48.56 --> 02:39:49.56
There they're dope.

2837
02:39:49.56 --> 02:39:50.56
Then last time we were a lot of good stuff on there.

2838
02:39:50.56 --> 02:39:51.56
Good fitness stuff.

2839
02:39:51.56 --> 02:39:52.56
When you think of storm troopers.

2840
02:39:52.56 --> 02:39:54.56
Do you actually think of like bad ass?

2841
02:39:54.56 --> 02:39:55.56
Yeah.

2842
02:39:55.56 --> 02:39:56.56
No.

2843
02:39:56.56 --> 02:39:57.56
Because I always think of them.

2844
02:39:57.56 --> 02:39:59.56
Things that get showled.

2845
02:39:59.56 --> 02:40:00.56
Yes.

2846
02:40:00.56 --> 02:40:01.56
And that is true.

2847
02:40:01.56 --> 02:40:02.56
That is true.

2848
02:40:02.56 --> 02:40:03.56
But.

2849
02:40:03.56 --> 02:40:04.56
Are they humans?

2850
02:40:04.56 --> 02:40:05.56
Yeah.

2851
02:40:05.56 --> 02:40:06.56
They're people.

2852
02:40:06.56 --> 02:40:07.56
They're troopers.

2853
02:40:07.56 --> 02:40:08.56
Actually, I think they're clones.

2854
02:40:08.56 --> 02:40:09.56
Okay.

2855
02:40:09.56 --> 02:40:10.56
People.

2856
02:40:10.56 --> 02:40:12.56
So they're just that's why they're just father.

2857
02:40:12.56 --> 02:40:14.56
They just get killed by laser beams all the time.

2858
02:40:14.56 --> 02:40:15.56
In the movie.

2859
02:40:15.56 --> 02:40:16.56
Yes.

2860
02:40:16.56 --> 02:40:18.56
But when you see a storm trooper kettlebell.

2861
02:40:18.56 --> 02:40:19.56
It's pretty cool.

2862
02:40:19.56 --> 02:40:20.56
Okay.

2863
02:40:20.56 --> 02:40:21.56
And there's a Darth Vader one.

2864
02:40:21.56 --> 02:40:22.56
There's an Iron Man one.

2865
02:40:22.56 --> 02:40:24.56
And there's a bubble fat guy.

2866
02:40:24.56 --> 02:40:25.56
We're single fat.

2867
02:40:25.56 --> 02:40:26.56
We're both on one.

2868
02:40:26.56 --> 02:40:27.56
We're all dead.

2869
02:40:27.56 --> 02:40:30.56
They're one is where the clone came from.

2870
02:40:30.56 --> 02:40:31.56
If I'm not mistaken.

2871
02:40:31.56 --> 02:40:32.56
I can't just.

2872
02:40:32.56 --> 02:40:33.56
I don't know.

2873
02:40:33.56 --> 02:40:36.56
I might have got my Star Wars mythology mixed up.

2874
02:40:36.56 --> 02:40:39.56
But nonetheless, they are kettlebells now on it.

2875
02:40:39.56 --> 02:40:40.56
Make some and they're dope.

2876
02:40:40.56 --> 02:40:42.56
A lot of cool stuff on there on it.

2877
02:40:42.56 --> 02:40:43.56
Nothing.

2878
02:40:43.56 --> 02:40:44.56
Slash.

2879
02:40:44.56 --> 02:40:45.56
Jockel.

2880
02:40:45.56 --> 02:40:46.56
We got Mikey in the Dragons book.

2881
02:40:46.56 --> 02:40:48.56
That's available right now.

2882
02:40:48.56 --> 02:40:50.56
For every kid that you know.

2883
02:40:50.56 --> 02:40:52.56

2884
02:40:52.56 --> 02:40:54.56

2885
02:40:54.56 --> 02:40:59.56
And way the warrior kid to marks mission.

2886
02:40:59.56 --> 02:41:03.56
Those are books to show your kid how to be on the path.

2887
02:41:03.56 --> 02:41:06.56
And now we have coming warrior kid.

2888
02:41:06.56 --> 02:41:07.56
Three.

2889
02:41:07.56 --> 02:41:09.56
Which now has a subtitle.

2890
02:41:09.56 --> 02:41:13.56
And the subtitle is where there's a will.

2891
02:41:13.56 --> 02:41:15.56
So he has to dig deep in this book.

2892
02:41:15.56 --> 02:41:17.56
Learn a little bit about digging deep.

2893
02:41:17.56 --> 02:41:20.56
He also learns a little bit about humility.

2894
02:41:20.56 --> 02:41:23.56
He learns about ego for the first time.

2895
02:41:23.56 --> 02:41:25.56
He starts getting involved.

2896
02:41:25.56 --> 02:41:29.56
So check out those books that I will let you know in a warrior kid.

2897
02:41:29.56 --> 02:41:31.56
Three is available for pre order.

2898
02:41:31.56 --> 02:41:33.56
Which we're going to be a little bit more efficient this time.

2899
02:41:33.56 --> 02:41:34.56
And we do pre order.

2900
02:41:34.56 --> 02:41:40.56
So we don't get into the Mikey in the Dragons situation where people have to wait a little extra time to get the book when it comes out.

2901
02:41:40.56 --> 02:41:42.56
So.

2902
02:41:42.56 --> 02:41:43.56
Book free.

2903
02:41:43.56 --> 02:41:44.56
I'll let you know when that's ready.

2904
02:41:44.56 --> 02:41:45.56
The field manual.

2905
02:41:45.56 --> 02:41:46.56
Discipline goes freedom.

2906
02:41:46.56 --> 02:41:47.56
Field manual.

2907
02:41:47.56 --> 02:41:48.56
Available right now.

2908
02:41:48.56 --> 02:41:50.56
I was with a buddy of mine that say.

2909
02:41:50.56 --> 02:41:54.56
In the finance world and has, you know, one of those.

2910
02:41:54.56 --> 02:42:00.56
I guess it would be a stereotypical office of the finance, the investment bankers.

2911
02:42:00.56 --> 02:42:01.56
So you know what I'm talking about?

2912
02:42:01.56 --> 02:42:03.56
Everything is all clean.

2913
02:42:03.56 --> 02:42:05.56
New York City type there.

2914
02:42:05.56 --> 02:42:11.56
And he showed me a picture in there as you walk in this beautiful clean office.

2915
02:42:11.56 --> 02:42:12.56
Entry way.

2916
02:42:12.56 --> 02:42:13.56
It's not even office.

2917
02:42:13.56 --> 02:42:14.56
It's like a thing.

2918
02:42:14.56 --> 02:42:15.56
A thing.

2919
02:42:15.56 --> 02:42:16.56
A four year.

2920
02:42:16.56 --> 02:42:17.56
Yeah.

2921
02:42:17.56 --> 02:42:17.56
Yeah.

2922
02:42:17.56 --> 02:42:18.56
One of those.

2923
02:42:18.56 --> 02:42:19.56
And there's a white table.

2924
02:42:19.56 --> 02:42:22.56
You know, it's probably eight by eight.

2925
02:42:22.56 --> 02:42:23.56
Yeah.

2926
02:42:23.56 --> 02:42:25.56
There's one book by itself.

2927
02:42:25.56 --> 02:42:26.56
Yeah.

2928
02:42:26.56 --> 02:42:27.56
The field manual.

2929
02:42:27.56 --> 02:42:31.56
And he says his, his, his, from office, growing up in the day said,

2930
02:42:31.56 --> 02:42:34.56
Everyone that comes in looks at that book and says,

2931
02:42:34.56 --> 02:42:35.56
What is this?

2932
02:42:35.56 --> 02:42:36.56
Where did this come from?

2933
02:42:36.56 --> 02:42:37.56
Where did you get this?

2934
02:42:37.56 --> 02:42:38.56
Every single person.

2935
02:42:38.56 --> 02:42:39.56
Yeah.

2936
02:42:39.56 --> 02:42:41.56
So that's the field manual.

2937
02:42:41.56 --> 02:42:42.56
Discipline goes freedom.

2938
02:42:42.56 --> 02:42:43.56
Field manual.

2939
02:42:43.56 --> 02:42:45.56
Get it for anyone that needs to.

2940
02:42:45.56 --> 02:42:46.56
It'll help.

2941
02:42:46.56 --> 02:42:51.56
Being on the path.

2942
02:42:51.56 --> 02:42:52.56
Yeah.

2943
02:42:52.56 --> 02:42:54.56
And you know, who needs help you on the path?

2944
02:42:54.56 --> 02:42:55.56
Everybody.

2945
02:42:55.56 --> 02:42:57.56
Extreme ownership.

2946
02:42:57.56 --> 02:42:58.56
First book.

2947
02:42:58.56 --> 02:42:59.56
I wrote with my brother, Lave Babin.

2948
02:42:59.56 --> 02:43:01.56
Leadership lessons from the battlefield.

2949
02:43:01.56 --> 02:43:05.56
And then we wrote that dichotomy of leadership, which

2950
02:43:05.56 --> 02:43:10.56
gives some guidance on how to be more balanced as a leader because if you get out of balance as a leader,

2951
02:43:10.56 --> 02:43:15.56
you go extreme in one direction or the other in a multitude of various dichotomies.

2952
02:43:15.56 --> 02:43:20.56
You will rip your team apart, which is not good.

2953
02:43:20.56 --> 02:43:22.56
So dichotomy of leadership and get that one.

2954
02:43:22.56 --> 02:43:24.56
We also got echelon front, which is.

2955
02:43:24.56 --> 02:43:26.56
Heart leadership consultancy.

2956
02:43:26.56 --> 02:43:29.56
And that's what we do is we solve problems through leadership.

2957
02:43:29.56 --> 02:43:30.56
It's me.

2958
02:43:30.56 --> 02:43:31.56
It's Lave Babin, J.P.

2959
02:43:31.56 --> 02:43:36.56
to now Dave Burke, Flynn, Cochran, Mike's Riley, Mike Bim, go to echelonfront.com.

2960
02:43:36.56 --> 02:43:39.56
If you want us to come and work with your company.

2961
02:43:39.56 --> 02:43:44.56
Get your leadership aligned and get your entire organization on the path to the victim.

2962
02:43:44.56 --> 02:43:45.56
Hit us up.

2963
02:43:45.56 --> 02:43:48.56
We have the master, which is our leadership event.

2964
02:43:48.56 --> 02:43:53.56
2019 we're doing May 23rd and 24th in Chicago.

2965
02:43:53.56 --> 02:43:58.56
We're doing September 19th and 20th in Denver and we're doing December 4th and 5th in Sydney, Australia.

2966
02:43:58.56 --> 02:43:59.56
Are you going to Australia with us?

2967
02:43:59.56 --> 02:44:00.56
Yes.

2968
02:44:00.56 --> 02:44:01.56
Okay.

2969
02:44:01.56 --> 02:44:03.56
So that's what's happening.

2970
02:44:03.56 --> 02:44:06.56
Every event that we've done has sold out.

2971
02:44:06.56 --> 02:44:11.56
And when I say sold out, I mean, we're personal friends of mine are saying, hey,

2972
02:44:11.56 --> 02:44:15.56
hey, it's a little late, but can you just say, I just need three seats.

2973
02:44:15.56 --> 02:44:18.56
You know, for me and my girlfriend and my buddy, we're going to go.

2974
02:44:18.56 --> 02:44:20.56
And I'm like, actually, no, I can't.

2975
02:44:20.56 --> 02:44:25.56
There's no more seats and the fire code will not allow any more human beings in there.

2976
02:44:25.56 --> 02:44:27.56
So these are all we're going to sell out.

2977
02:44:27.56 --> 02:44:32.56
They'll be no alibis.

2978
02:44:32.56 --> 02:44:36.56
Like, well, in the military, it's called Safe Rounds Rallibis, meeting like I got an extra round.

2979
02:44:36.56 --> 02:44:38.56
Hey, just go one more.

2980
02:44:38.56 --> 02:44:40.56
No, it's not going to happen.

2981
02:44:40.56 --> 02:44:43.56
So, and don't get mad if that does happen.

2982
02:44:43.56 --> 02:44:49.56
You know, oh, jok, you, you know, can't help you.

2983
02:44:49.56 --> 02:44:52.56
We have to talk to that fire march.

2984
02:44:52.56 --> 02:44:57.56
So, if you want to call sign up early, extremownership.com.

2985
02:44:57.56 --> 02:45:00.56
I'll tell you what, the Australia one is going to be.

2986
02:45:00.56 --> 02:45:03.56
It's going to sell out quick because I think there's 450 seats.

2987
02:45:03.56 --> 02:45:05.56
That is not a lot.

2988
02:45:05.56 --> 02:45:09.56
When I did a book signing up in Brizzy of the Brizbean Australia,

2989
02:45:09.56 --> 02:45:13.56
Brizbean, there was a ton of people there.

2990
02:45:13.56 --> 02:45:18.56
That fluid of Brisbane take to hang out for five minutes, you know,

2991
02:45:18.56 --> 02:45:19.56
get a book signed.

2992
02:45:19.56 --> 02:45:23.56
So, that one in Sydney is going to be sold out quick.

2993
02:45:23.56 --> 02:45:25.56
So, jump on there.

2994
02:45:25.56 --> 02:45:29.56

It will ingrain them into you.

3008
02:46:04.56 --> 02:46:06.56

02:46:46.56 --> 02:46:50.56
And if you want to talk to us,

3022
02:46:50.56 --> 02:46:57.56
or you want to share a good book with us like somebody shared this psychology for the fighting man with me on the interwebs.

3023
02:46:57.56 --> 02:47:01.56
That's what we can be found on Twitter, on Instagram,

3024
02:47:01.56 --> 02:47:04.56
and on Facebook.

3025
02:47:04.56 --> 02:47:05.56
Kish.

3026
02:47:05.56 --> 02:47:11.56
Eko is at Eko Charles and I am at Jaka Willink.

3027
02:47:11.56 --> 02:47:13.56
And of course,

3028
02:47:13.56 --> 02:47:18.56
thanks to all of those who serve our military personnel,

3029
02:47:18.56 --> 02:47:20.56
police and law enforcement firefighters,

3030
02:47:20.56 --> 02:47:22.56
paramedics, EMTs, correction officers,

3031
02:47:22.56 --> 02:47:26.56
border patrol, all first responders.

3032
02:47:26.56 --> 02:47:30.56
All of you that put on a uniform and protect us.

3033
02:47:30.56 --> 02:47:33.56
From evil in the world.

3034
02:47:33.56 --> 02:47:37.56
We can only do what we do because you do what you do.

3035
02:47:37.56 --> 02:47:39.56
So thank you.

3036
02:47:39.56 --> 02:47:43.56
And to everyone else out there that is listening,

3037
02:47:43.56 --> 02:47:46.56
remember to train hard.

3038
02:47:46.56 --> 02:47:48.56
Do your best to prepare.

3039
02:47:48.56 --> 02:47:50.56
Stay in the fight.

3040
02:47:50.56 --> 02:47:55.56
And even though you might not feel like it sometimes,

3041
02:47:55.56 --> 02:47:57.56
you can drive on.

3042
02:47:57.56 --> 02:48:00.56
You can push through.

3043
02:48:00.56 --> 02:48:06.56
You can deal with unimaginable adversity.

3044
02:48:06.56 --> 02:48:12.56
This long as you keep getting up every day,

3045
02:48:12.56 --> 02:48:16.56
moving forward and getting after it.

3046
02:48:16.56 --> 02:48:19.56
So until next time,

3047
02:48:19.56 --> 02:48:22.56
this is Eko and Jaka.

3048
02:48:22.56 --> 02:48:29.56
Out.
