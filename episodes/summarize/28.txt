So automatically you feel sense of competition when you see a guy near you in your, like, environment, you know, like, if you're, you got, you got to the gym or you got a GG2, like, what happens if the new guy walks in and he's about your size and he walks into the GG2? I was like a cool victory for the class and everyone was all laughing and fired up, you know, like we're going to be so perfect that people are going to get angry with us. There's like more to it, you know, it's like you're saying that, you know, you know, you're doing it. Yeah, and even at the time where it seems valuable, sure trust, but it's times like this where that trust is going to shine even more, you know, when you can just say, you don't even have to say why I do it because you just know. Let's say, you know, that really the question I was wondering is like in life, you know, God was there and he said, okay, I'm going to bestow one of these on you in just in your life. Like, like, a little bit of results, like, like, heradicate, remember heradicate when he's making them. And if I go too strong in one direction, I'm going to affect your, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to offend your ego. And if all you're going to do is beat your head against it, eventually you're going to, you're going to not make and you're going to die. You're like, hey, choose this class at this time and this time you're like, you almost, it's almost like one of the biggest tests in college is if you can pass everything that you just talked about. You know, and you're just like, yeah, guys are going, that's the last thing I want to do. So again, the better relationship you have, the easier this is going to be because you're going to have that little mental unification of the commanders intent and of the task and purpose and you're going to be able to be thinking along the same path. Yeah, or if I have a, yeah, anything, you know, anything that I think up to build or buy, you know, because of other people like me thought it up From being in platoons myself from growing up in the teams and then going into combat and then training platoons and then going into the corporate world and seeing what leadership does like there and the context of that. So if you're not that into grades and stuff in high school and you don't see that clearly like how you would if you're like 27, 28 years old coming back and seeing like the real value of education and college and stuff. Then you can imagine what the morale is like day after day you're going out as we just said, going out, walking through the bush just in order to get blown up. Then I'm going to hang out for a little bit, eat some dinner and then I'm going to go and, you know, finish up and review stuff. And only way you're going to be able to do that, the only way you're going to be able to figure out if you're just being too smart or not smart enough or too tough or not tough enough is to be able to detach and step back and look and see assess the situation. Because if you're letting your, let's say you got sales people and you say, oh, you know, what don't worry about making some phone calls today, you know what, I don't want to push you too hard. This is not some people here this kind of talk that I'm saying and all of a sudden they want to turn into a super hyper aggressive person that's going berserk on everybody and trying to enforce every little order and every little discipline so hard that it breaks the guys down. And you know, I think part of it, and you talked about this the other day, you were talking about how, when you know due to, if you know due to, then you can, you have a certain context that you can learn due to due. So the reason I highlighted that is because when we start talking about hackworth and what he does, you're going to see that he's going to, like the terms he uses here is gung-hole lieutenant drove the troops. Because if you make that decision that you want to crush it, if you want to make the decision that you're going to prove to people that you know what? And that's one of the things that I kind of think of why people like this podcast and that's sort of like what I have to offer is I've seen a lot of these things from a leadership perspective. Like when someone comes into the gym and they're mad dog and me, it's not hard for me to be like, hey man, what's going on? Now these kids that you're going to be going to college with, they're not going to have this attitude. Now, some classes you're going to love, and they're going to, you're going to learn a lot from. We're going to call in the meta-vac, we're going to get them out of the best weekend if they're not dead and then we're going to keep walking until it happens again. What we learned today, I'm using that, like, on a, like, back to a video game where, um, you know, you choose your guy or your kid. Like I said, when your 18 coming out of high school, everyone's talking with your parents or talking about it most likely kids around you're like, hey, I got into this college. Like boom, boom, playing to and then now when I get to up or whatever, I'm like, oh, shoot, I'm kind of like a upgraded person now. And then you tell them, you know, that's what you're going to look like. Like you're like, hey, I know I'm not mentally tough. Like whatever, like the test was like this almost a way to just show off how powerful that is.
