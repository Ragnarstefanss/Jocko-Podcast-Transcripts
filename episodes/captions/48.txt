[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 48 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:12] We found General Custer on the Bluffs and near him lay the bodies of 11 of his officers.
[00:00:19] As a tribute to his bravery, the Indians had not mutilated General Custer and he lay as if a sleep.
[00:00:29] But all the other men had been most brutally mangled and had been stripped of their clothing.
[00:00:36] Many of their skulls had been crushed in, eyes had been torn from their sockets, hands, feet, arms, legs, and noses had been wrenched off.
[00:00:47] Many had their flesh cut and stripped the entire length of their bodies.
[00:00:53] And there were others whose limbs were closely perforated with bullet holes, showing that the torture had been inflicted while the wretched victims were yet alive.
[00:01:07] There were 29 enlisted men missing from the field of blood and they undoubtedly had been taken prisoners and perished at the stake
[00:01:15] while the Indians were celebrating their scalp dance on the night of the 25th in sight of my camp.
[00:01:24] Lying almost at Custer's feet was young read, a nephew of the generals who had been visiting him at Fort Lincoln and who had pleaded to go on the campaign
[00:01:35] where this handsome lad of 19 met such an untimely fate.
[00:01:41] Within a few feet of the general lay his two brothers, Boston and Tom.
[00:01:48] There was in the whole army no more popular man than Galant Tom Custer.
[00:01:54] He was young, handsome, a prince of good fellows and full of that bravery that even characterized the Custers.
[00:02:02] He had served with distinction during the war and had fought frequently before
[00:02:11] been engaged in Indian fights.
[00:02:15] As we approached him, we were horrified to see that his body had been opened and is heart torn out.
[00:02:22] Thus I know that the vengeance of rain in the face had been at work.
[00:02:27] Several years before rain in the face had murdered two white men of our fort and afterwards
[00:02:34] boasted of it in the reservation. He was arrested and brought to trial by Tom Custer.
[00:02:40] But before the time appointed for his case had arrived, the Wiley Indian had escaped sending
[00:02:45] back word to Captain Tom that he would be revenge by cutting out his captors' heart.
[00:02:50] Rain in the face kept his word by literally tearing out the heart of young Tom Custer.
[00:03:00] Near these three brothers and their boyish nephew, lay their brother-in-law, Lt. Calhoun,
[00:03:06] who had fallen on the skirmish line. Custer's command was completely annihilated,
[00:03:12] not one of his men escaping. Good evening, Echo. Good evening.
[00:03:24] Not right there is an excerpt from a book called I Thought with Custer,
[00:03:33] which is the story of Charles Windolph, who is a young private that fought with one of the other
[00:03:39] companies in the same seventh cavalry regiment that General George Custer led.
[00:03:49] General George Custer, who was killed at the Battle of Little Big Horn, where he fought the
[00:03:56] Native Americans, including our friend Woodenleg, who we heard from on podcasts 45.
[00:04:05] But the opening section that I just read wasn't actually written by private Windolph.
[00:04:12] It is a section of an account that is written by a guy named Major Reno, who was one of the leaders
[00:04:18] of one of the other companies of men at the Battle that they include in this book.
[00:04:25] This book called I Thought with Custer, and this was obviously a brutal battle.
[00:04:31] And my goal as always, I shouldn't say, is always, but my goal,
[00:04:41] or where I like to focus, is not so much on what details happen in the battle, but what details
[00:04:51] happened with the human nature in the battle, the people, the leadership, the decisions.
[00:04:58] And we got some good understanding about the Native American perspective from Woodenleg.
[00:05:07] But now let's hear a little bit of what it was like for the troopers.
[00:05:15] And I know I use that term on a fairly regular basis, but that is a very specific term
[00:05:20] in a cavalry unit. And at this time a cavalry unit was literally units that they ride horses.
[00:05:32] That's what it is mounted cavalry, a soldier in a cavalry unit is specifically called a trooper.
[00:05:39] And the word nowadays, it actually is used to cover a lot of different people.
[00:05:45] You know, armored units use it airborne units. You know, you think of an airborne unit,
[00:05:49] parachuters, you think of a paratrooper, trooper being the key word.
[00:05:54] Obviously there's police, state troopers, and then obviously there's people that listen this podcast.
[00:06:02] But that is what we have here, the cavalry unit. And this, in particular, was the seventh cavalry regiment.
[00:06:10] And the trooper, like I said, is this guy private Charles Windolph, who was actually born in Germany.
[00:06:19] And emigrated to the United States, he became a cobbler.
[00:06:24] Like his dad, you know, the cobbler is people who fix shoes, people who fix shoes.
[00:06:30] And you know what, he fix shoes for a while, but he didn't like fixing shoes. So what did you do?
[00:06:34] Join the army. And he ended up fighting in some of the Indian wars.
[00:06:43] He actually received the Medal of Honor for his actions at Little Big Horn and
[00:06:49] we'll get into those. But let's hear what private Windolph has to say.
[00:06:57] I'm going to the book. June 25th, 1946 was the last time I saw him alive.
[00:07:11] Two days later, I looked down on him lying in the white in the Montana sun. That would have been
[00:07:17] June 27th, 1876. And the following day, I helped him. I helped Barry him and his brother,
[00:07:26] Captain Tom Custer. They were putting graves alongside one another. It was hard digging there
[00:07:33] on that high ridge that bordered Little Big Horn. It's a long time to remember
[00:07:39] details and little things. But when you've been thinking back on them all those years, they don't
[00:07:46] fade away as easily as you might think. They're like birds. They stick in your mind.
[00:07:52] People call it the Custer Massacre. It wasn't any massacre. It was a straight hard fight and
[00:08:03] the five troops who were with Custer simply got cut to ribbons and every last white man destroyed.
[00:08:10] I say every last white man because there were one or two crow scouts who claimed they saw the
[00:08:15] start of the fight and then skiddattled. A Crow Indian named Curly said he escaped from the battle
[00:08:21] field by putting a blanket over his head and pretending he was a wounded suit. I don't know whether
[00:08:27] there's any truth in that or not. I never quite believed it. There's been all kinds of stories
[00:08:32] about that battle. Even the men who were with Benteen and Reno and lived to tell the tale
[00:08:38] didn't come anywhere near telling the same stories about what they did and what they saw.
[00:08:44] Some of them wanted to make heroes out of themselves or of their officers.
[00:08:48] I only had one pair of eyes. So of course all I can tell is what I saw myself.
[00:08:56] If it is something that I only heard, I'll be sure to mark it down as that.
[00:09:04] Interestingly, this is something that we used to see all the time in that you go out of an operation
[00:09:09] and when things happen, two guys almost nobody will see the same thing.
[00:09:15] Everybody sees some things a little bit different and it's difficult to figure out what's actually
[00:09:21] accurate. So that's and he's he's going back when he's writing this book. I think it's been
[00:09:27] 70 years. So when he's being interviewed and he's writing this book, it's been 70 years. And he's
[00:09:33] saying he still remembers the details, but 70 years is a long time, long time. And the characters
[00:09:40] that he just brought up Benteen is a guy that he worked for and Reno was one of the other majors.
[00:09:47] And another word that they use here is Troop. Now this is a word that's
[00:09:51] we think of it as an individual. Hey, there's a trooper over there. There's a troop.
[00:09:54] It actually, it actually is another term that means basically like a company of guys. Now
[00:10:01] you can see it's small and this is more like a platoon. What they're talking about would be considered
[00:10:05] a platoon. I would say from Reedan he had five troops with him, custard did that got killed.
[00:10:13] You know, about 200 guys. And so we're not talking about a massive group of people in each troop.
[00:10:21] But that's what they're talking about. 20 guys per trooper. Actually, what did that be?
[00:10:24] 40 guys per troop for five. And so that's what they're talking about. And they refer to the
[00:10:29] troops. And even they use the word interchangeably and sometimes they refer to as companies and
[00:10:33] sometimes they say troops. Yeah. So you'll go and back to the book here when he's
[00:10:42] initially in the army and what they're doing and he talks about what they were doing
[00:10:48] at this time. It was pretty dull soldering down there in the south. The regiment was broken up into
[00:10:53] companies or small battalions and our job was to smash the Ku Klux Klant and run down a
[00:11:00] illicit whiskey distillers. It wasn't much fun for energetic spirited young men.
[00:11:08] And he now he's going to talk a little bit about the seventh cavalry. As I say, the seventh
[00:11:13] cavalry was only seven years old in 1873, but it had a fine reputation. Everybody in the country,
[00:11:19] new general custer. And he was always bragging about what a fine fighting regiment he had.
[00:11:26] He was supposed to be the best Indian fighter in the American army. In the civil war,
[00:11:32] they'd called them the boy general. And he'd been a dashing popular figure.
[00:11:38] The regiment had spent its first four years of its life on the Kansas Plains and an
[00:11:42] Indian Territory. The old timers in the outfit could sure tell some blood curling Indian stories.
[00:11:51] They used to say that it was worse than straight death to get captured by the Indians
[00:11:56] because you would be slowly tortured until you gave up the ghost. They told all of us young soldiers
[00:12:03] if we were ever wounded in an Indian fight and left behind and in danger of being captured
[00:12:08] that we must save our last cartridge to blow out our brains. So that's an interesting point when we
[00:12:16] remember wooden legs said that all the guys in custer's group ended up killing themselves. And
[00:12:23] maybe that's all, you know, that very well might have happened. Or at least some of them.
[00:12:34] Back to the book by the spring of 1873, the Plains Indians had been largely debased.
[00:12:39] Beaton and driven to the great reservations that had been allotted to the various tribes.
[00:12:43] It had not been a deliberate government policy, but it had been cruelly effective one.
[00:12:49] Treaty after treaty had been broken by the relentless pressure of white men and their civilization.
[00:12:56] Constantly pushing against the ineffective resistance of the red men.
[00:13:01] Now, when again, the Indians had struck back and as a rule, their angry flareups were put down
[00:13:08] by the army and then new and drastic treaties would be made and more land taken from them in punishment.
[00:13:15] But the ink would hardly be dry on these new government commitments before the white pressure would
[00:13:21] be resumed. Intrusions made. And once again, the bewildered and raged Indians would strike back
[00:13:27] only to be subdued by the army and harsh penalties imposed on them. It was a deadly and vicious
[00:13:34] cycle. The Indian found himself whirling endlessly in. So that's reminds me of a lot of
[00:13:45] conflicts where you have these things happen. The white man is putting pressure on the Indians.
[00:13:54] The Indians don't know what's going on. So they lash out a little bit. What are the white
[00:13:58] man do then? Go in there. Smash them. Take more land from them. Compress them more.
[00:14:04] Eventually, there's another lash out and you just get this vicious cycle.
[00:14:07] In 1864, a certain Colonel Shivington with a regiment of volunteer Colorado cavalry had suddenly
[00:14:21] moved against a large encampment of shions and indiscriminately killed some 300 Indians.
[00:14:28] The massacre unquestionably had turned many lukewarm Indians into out and out hostiles.
[00:14:35] This bitterness of the shions was inflamed two or three years later when
[00:14:41] Custer led his newly formed seventh cavalry against black kettle and his band. In a sudden attack
[00:14:48] against their sleeping village on the Washtida in Texas. The shions who were recognized as the most
[00:14:56] brilliant Indian fighters of the plains never forgave either Custer or his seventh cavalry
[00:15:02] for this whirling attack on their sleeping village in the dead of winter.
[00:15:11] Another big, yeah, so atrocities on both sides clearly, I'll talk a little bit about those as
[00:15:20] well, but one of the biggest atrocities beyond the killing of the Indians themselves, the Native
[00:15:27] Americans themselves and those type of atrocities was what they did with the buffaloes.
[00:15:30] Because the white man was coming and killing all the buffaloes.
[00:15:36] And I'll go to the book here. Once the buffalo around who's existance the whole economy of
[00:15:42] the Indian was based was killed off. The nomads had nothing to do but submit to government control
[00:15:48] and become agency Indians. Degraded, whiskey crazed and beaten.
[00:15:55] Only the various tribes of the Sue and the fighting shions refused to be broken on the
[00:16:00] wheel of civilization. A few determined leaders such as sitting bull, crazy horse,
[00:16:06] gall, American horse, two moon, white bull, spotted eagle and chief hunk, stubbornly held out
[00:16:14] against the threats and blandishments of the whites. But by the spring of 1873,
[00:16:20] they were beginning to be branded as hostile. So that's something that I didn't focus on enough
[00:16:27] when I talked about how the Sue and the Cheyenne kind of faded. Well, one of the main reasons
[00:16:33] that they faded was, you know, again, they gave up their guns at a certain point. But we the white man
[00:16:40] had decimated the buffaloes. And so that was their main way of survival. If you remember from
[00:16:45] wooden leg, that's where they lived. They lived in shelters that were made from buffalo skins.
[00:16:49] And obviously they ate buffalo all the time. They hunted buffalo. They ate them. They made their
[00:16:54] weapons out of buffalo. Everything that they did was with buffalo. And so when the white man
[00:17:00] came in and killed all the buffalo, that put them in a real precarious situation.
[00:17:08] Now we go back to the book talking a little bit about what it was like being the cavalry at this
[00:17:12] time. Each man would look after his own horse and we'd usually give him a little exercise and a good
[00:17:19] rubbed down. A trooper thought a lot of his mount. And a cavalry man would have to be a pre-mean.
[00:17:26] It would have to be pretty mean who didn't take good care of his horse. If we got a good chance,
[00:17:30] we'd steal him a little extra oats or hay for individual mounts. My horse at this time was named
[00:17:37] pig. That wasn't his real name. But I called him that because nothing could keep him from rolling
[00:17:43] in a mud hole when he was being watered. After we'd come in from a long ride, he was fast and he
[00:17:49] could show his heels to most of the horses in the regiment. I fought a lot of them, but the army
[00:17:53] condemned him after we'd been beaten in the Dakota country a year or two. After we'd been in the
[00:17:59] Dakota country a year or two. I'll tell you later about the horse I rode in the battle of little
[00:18:05] big horn. But one one thing about pig. Two or three years after the army sold him, I saw him
[00:18:12] in a contractor's six horse team in the black hills. He looked so poor and abused. I'd have bought
[00:18:18] him from that contractor on the spot, but I didn't have the money. I went up to him and headed him.
[00:18:25] He knew me all right. He knickered and looked at me as much to say, come on, please Charlie,
[00:18:30] get me out of here. I had ridden old pig thousands of miles and more than once he had saved my life.
[00:18:36] I'd pretty near cried when I saw him that time in the black hills.
[00:18:45] Big connection. You know, we see that nowadays with the guys that work with dogs,
[00:18:50] and the military working dogs, which are awesome animals and those guys get major,
[00:18:56] majorly connected to those dogs. She's like horse, where it's just, there's a lot of them's
[00:19:02] worth just unimbed in the world. It's just you and him. It's like, dang, you go through so much together,
[00:19:07] upstones. And then, for sure, I can't even imagine the emotion of that situation.
[00:19:15] Back to the book, it was at the yankton that I first saw general custer. He was not far from six feet
[00:19:22] tall. He must have weighed around 180 pounds. He was energetic and it was mighty hard to wear
[00:19:27] him out. I've heard people say that when he was at West Point, he was the second strongest man there.
[00:19:35] As I remember him at the time, he was wearing long hair, something like Buffalo Bill used to wear.
[00:19:40] Yet a big wide-bring western hat and long military mustache. His hair and mustache were yellow,
[00:19:47] tony colored. I suppose would be the right way to describe them. He had on high-wellington boots.
[00:19:54] They were the kind that came up to the knees with the front three or four inches higher than the back.
[00:20:00] They were popular among officers at the time. General custer wasn't the kind to mix freely with
[00:20:06] the men. In those years there, was quite a gulf between the officers and the enlisted men.
[00:20:13] Some of the officers were friendly and easy going with their troopers, but there was always a gulf.
[00:20:17] Custer struck me as being aloof and removed. Noted. It got to be gossip among the troopers
[00:20:30] that some of the officers didn't set so very well with the general. My captain, Colonel Benteen.
[00:20:37] So there's something interesting I want to point this out. Some of these including general
[00:20:42] custer, these guys have been promoted during the civil war. So general custer had become a general
[00:20:48] during the civil war, but after the war they got demoted. They got put back down and rank because
[00:20:53] they shrank the armies. They shrank the army. And so for instance general custer at this time was
[00:21:00] he had been a general in the civil war. Now all of a sudden he's a Colonel. So he got put down and
[00:21:04] rank and it's the same with he's talking about his boss. Windoffs boss. Windoffs boss was a guy named
[00:21:15] Captain Benteen, but they called him Colonel Benteen because he was a Colonel during civil war.
[00:21:20] My captain Colonel Benteen was one of those folks who didn't belong to the generals in
[00:21:24] or circle. I suppose you could say about half the officers in the regiment were close to
[00:21:29] custer and the rest were not. I repeat that Benteen was not distinct was distinctly not an
[00:21:35] intimate of custer. I heard all sorts of reasons why that was true. There was one report that Benteen
[00:21:41] had turned bitter because custer had pulled out after the battle of the Washeeda in December 1868
[00:21:47] in Kansas and it left a major Elliott and 17 men to their fate. A day or two later they were all
[00:21:54] found killed, scout, and mutilated. There was a story that custer and Benteen had some hard words
[00:22:02] over that, but of course I don't know how true that old story is. So there you go. Benteen thought
[00:22:12] custer let some guys hang out to dry, had to confront it and custer didn't like that at all.
[00:22:18] And now they got some stuff that they're at odds about. And speaking of that event where
[00:22:27] these 17 men were were killed in this book, they have an excerpt that's a letter from an army officer
[00:22:36] that got published in a newspaper about that event. And I'm going to read it.
[00:22:42] The bodies were found in a small circle stripped as naked as windborne and frozen stiff.
[00:22:50] Their heads had been battered in and some of them had been entirely chopped off.
[00:22:56] Some of them had the Adam's apple cut out of their fruits. Some had their hands and feet caught
[00:23:01] off and nearly all had been horribly mangled in a way delicacy forbids me to mention.
[00:23:07] They lay scarcely two miles from the scene of the fight.
[00:23:14] Who can describe the feeling of that brave band as with anxious hearts beating? They
[00:23:21] strained their yearning eyes in the direction whence they help should come.
[00:23:26] What must have been the despair that when all hopes of soccer died out,
[00:23:31] nerve their stout arms to do and die? Round and round rush the red themes, smaller and smaller
[00:23:41] shrinks the circle, but the aim of that devoted gallant knot of heroes is steady or than ever
[00:23:48] and the death howl of the murderous red skin is more frequent.
[00:23:53] But on they come and masses grim with glittering lans and one long loud exulting
[00:24:00] whoop as if the gates of hell had opened and loosed the whole infernal host.
[00:24:08] A well-directed volley from their trusty carbines makes some of the miscreants real and fall,
[00:24:13] but their death rattles are drowned in the greater din.
[00:24:18] Soon every voice in that little band is still as death, but the hellish work of the
[00:24:25] savages is scarce begun and their ingenuys are taxed to invent barbarities to practice on the bodies
[00:24:34] of the fallen brave.
[00:24:41] Some psychological warfare going on there. Clearly we know that the troopers at this time
[00:24:48] think you don't want to get captured by the Indians and the reason that they think that is events
[00:24:55] like this, mutilated bodies, everyone killed no quarter given.
[00:25:03] Now going to what some of the other officers we're like I'm going to talk about Captain Benteen.
[00:25:10] Here's what Captain Benteen was like back to the book. Most of the time we were in the field,
[00:25:14] Captain Benteen commanded a squadron. Usually you'd have one or two companies besides his own
[00:25:19] age company. He was a wonderful officer. He let the first sergeant pretty much run the company.
[00:25:28] Little decentralized command going on. He wasn't always interfering and running the details.
[00:25:34] So he wasn't getting in the way. He wasn't a micro manager. I served under Benteen for 12
[00:25:38] full years, lacking only those three days. One of the best descriptions of Captain Benteen is that
[00:25:45] penned by the late major general Hugh L. Scott on page 454 of his interesting book,
[00:25:53] some memoirs of the soldier. I found my model early in Captain Benteen, the idol of the
[00:26:01] seventh cavalry on the upper Missouri in 1877, who governed mainly by suggestion. In all the years,
[00:26:10] I knew him. I never once heard him raise his voice to enforce his purpose. Think about that.
[00:26:17] Never once heard him raise his voice to enforce his purpose. He would sit by the open fire at night.
[00:26:25] His bright pleasant face framed by his snow white hair, beaming with kindness and humor,
[00:26:30] and often watched, often I watched his every movement to find out the secret of his quiet,
[00:26:35] steady government that I might go and govern likewise. For example, if he intended to stay a few
[00:26:44] days in one camp, he would say to his agitant, Brewer, don't you think we had better take up
[00:26:51] our regular guard, Mount Wallen camp, and Brewer always thought it better and so did everyone else.
[00:26:58] If he found this kindly manner was misunderstood, then his iron hand would close quickly down,
[00:27:06] but that was seldom necessary. And then only with newcomers and never twice with the same person.
[00:27:15] So this is just complete example of indirect leadership. Hey, don't you?
[00:27:20] Hey, Echo, do you think you'd be good if we're going to stay in this camp? We should put our camp guards out.
[00:27:23] What do you think? Of course. There you go. So you make it happen. I didn't give you an order.
[00:27:29] I actually let you get some ownership of it. It's actually now your decision is not even my decision anymore.
[00:27:36] That's a really good example of some solid leadership.
[00:27:42] Here's what it was like to be in the camp for me. It was wonderful to be young and to be
[00:27:46] riding into Indian country as part of the finest regiment of cavalry in the world. We were mighty proud
[00:27:54] of the seventh. It just didn't seem like anything could ever happen to it.
[00:28:04] Now I'm going to go through, they're riding out, they're working the planes. And I'm going to go through
[00:28:11] a little battle on the planes where
[00:28:13] clusters and charge general, George Custer's in charge. The general started, so did the Indians.
[00:28:20] They had a good start in general, Custer resolved not to pursue them too far away from his men.
[00:28:26] After a sharp, short race, he stopped on the plane, keeping well away from the suspicious woods.
[00:28:33] When he stopped, the Indians stopped. He was evident that they would not be so audacious without
[00:28:40] a consciousness of strength somewhere. For ways that are dark and tricks that are vain,
[00:28:48] the heathensu is almost as peculiar as the heathen Chinese.
[00:28:56] And I actually had to go and do a little research on that one. There's a poem
[00:29:02] that's it's about Chinese migrant workers. That interests you can go and read about this poem.
[00:29:07] It's called the Heathen Chinese. And if you read the poem, you realize that
[00:29:14] he's trying to describe that they're playing cards with a couple of the people working on a
[00:29:20] train or playing cards of the Chinese guy. And as they're playing cards,
[00:29:27] they're kind of treating the Chinese guy like he's ignorant, but he's actually winning.
[00:29:32] And when they accused him of cheating, there's a fight and it was actually the white guy that was cheating.
[00:29:37] One of the other white guys that was cheating. So the guy that wrote the poem had written the poem
[00:29:41] with the intention of showing hey, these people are smart and they're trustworthy. But because of the
[00:29:47] name, it got red and misinterpreted a lot. The title of the poem, the Hiven Chinese, you know,
[00:29:54] that's not a very positive name. At least that's kind of, I did some very quick research on that.
[00:30:01] Just to figure out what it's all about. And that's sort of what I gathered after a quick, uh,
[00:30:08] quick research. Meaning I googled it and read a few articles. Figure out what's going on.
[00:30:13] Hawaiian pigeon. We say Japanese. We say Japanese. We say Japanese.
[00:30:19] Portuguese is putagee. Chinese. Chinese. Maybe some maybe some relationship.
[00:30:27] Anxion. There. All right, back to the book. This time, the trick was indeed vain. They were fighting
[00:30:35] with no novice. As soon as general custer saw the Indian Dodge, which was to use these men as a
[00:30:40] decoy to draw them into the woods, he immediately sent his orderly back to Captain Moilin to order a
[00:30:45] platoon to dismount. Before the order could get back 250 mounted Indians drawn up in a line of battle
[00:30:52] came out of the woods and fine military style. The seventh cavalry could hardly have done it
[00:30:57] better with painted faces, heads decorated with ribbons. They sallied out with loud war wolves.
[00:31:05] General custer putting more confidence in the feet of his thoroughbred than the voice of his
[00:31:09] rifle against 250 Indians turned back to his command calling out to his brother to throw out a
[00:31:14] dismounted line. Lieutenant custer had anticipated the order and was already dismounting his men.
[00:31:22] That s awesome. So these guys work together. He goes to give the order. His brothers are already on it.
[00:31:28] They ran forward and took places in the grass. The Indians opened a heavy fire, which was
[00:31:32] quickly answered by our men with their sharp carbines. In a dismounted cavalry fight,
[00:31:38] every fourth man is usually detailed to hold the horses. But being short of fighting men and the
[00:31:45] reserves being several miles back with the train, general custer ordered every six men
[00:31:49] only to hold the horses and the rest to join the skirmish line. The Indians having three times
[00:31:55] as large a force and seeing the cavalry dismounted followed their example and dismounted.
[00:32:00] From their advantage of numbers, they were able to extend the skirmish line clear around from
[00:32:06] river to river so as to enclose the cavalry in a semi circle with the woods and the river at
[00:32:13] their back. They get inflanked. Finding that the horses were exposed to fire, general custer ordered
[00:32:20] them to be led further into the timber. Now, some other things take place and I'm kind of
[00:32:29] fast forward a little bit through the story. The Indians having lost two men were more cautious in
[00:32:33] their advance and finding that they could not with their heavy rifles drive the cavalry into the
[00:32:38] woods had recourse to another favorite weapon. They fired the grass in four or five places,
[00:32:45] meaning they set the grass on fire. So you imagine you're hiding the grass and then also
[00:32:51] they're setting the grass on fire. Fortunately, there was little or no wind and the grass was too
[00:32:56] short and too green to burn well. Else this new weapon might have proved formidable indeed.
[00:33:03] The fire, however, raised a blue curtain of smoke forming a corner segment between the fighting
[00:33:09] arcs. Failing in their attempt to raise a great fire, the red skins used this smoke line as a
[00:33:16] mask for their rifles. Advancing under cover of this curtain, they would pour a volley at our line
[00:33:23] and retreat a little bit of cover move happening. Our men soon discovered the dodge and laid
[00:33:29] equal claim to the curtain. The Indians abandoning this position began to draw in their men.
[00:33:35] Now, General Custer said to Captain Moillan, let us mount and drive them off. The men immediately
[00:33:41] mounted an advanced as skirmishers on a truck. Finding this was not fast enough, a charge was ordered.
[00:33:48] The men eager for the order gave a loud yell and put their horses into a full gallop.
[00:33:53] Nearly 300 to number, the sight of 80 cavalry men coming toward them like mad caps was too much
[00:34:00] for the Indians. They turned like sheep and scattered in every direction.
[00:34:09] Battles. Battles on the planes. Small unit tactics.
[00:34:16] Very similar to the small unit tactics that are used today.
[00:34:19] We smoke in Ramadi. We smoke in Ramadi. We smoke in the smoke. What are you using those for?
[00:34:25] Set up a little curtain so people can't see you when you're moving.
[00:34:32] And you'll notice also there was some aggressive action.
[00:34:36] It's that aggressive action. Both sides when they got aggressive, they started doing better.
[00:34:40] When you start getting when the other when your opponent becomes the aggressor,
[00:34:44] you start getting put on your heels. It's a good state aggressive. De-falte mode.
[00:34:53] Now talking a little bit about what it was like when they were back in camp.
[00:34:58] So they weren't on the road all the time. They weren't out in the planes all the time. Sometimes they
[00:35:00] would be back in camp. They had their bad bands. They had some of them had their wives there.
[00:35:07] They had good food. And you know, basically good stuff going on.
[00:35:13] They had pretty relaxed time. But it was always, let's prepare. We're going back out in the field.
[00:35:18] So they're back out in the field here. General Custer, who has used was writing a head with a
[00:35:23] couple of troops came upon smoldering campfires that showed that three Indian TPs had recently been
[00:35:29] there. He sent bloody knife ahead with several Indians. So that bloody knife you're going to
[00:35:34] hear is voiced throughout here. Bloody knife was Custer's right handman. He was a Indian scout.
[00:35:40] So they galloped back with the information that they had located the Indians.
[00:35:46] Custer surrounded the little camp and brought back four bucks with him to our camp.
[00:35:51] The head was a minor chief named Onestab, who squaw was a daughter of Red Cloud.
[00:35:57] Custer promised them food if they helped them. But they seemed to be in a hurry to leave.
[00:36:03] And before they could be checked, they mounted their ponies and were off. Custer sent troopers
[00:36:08] after them. But the only one they could catch and bring back was Onestab. He was told he would be
[00:36:14] given all the bacon, sugar, and coffee that two ponies could carry if he'd act as a guide. He agreed.
[00:36:27] So again, I guess the reason I wanted to bring that up is it shows that there was Indians
[00:36:32] working on both sides. And there was Indians that went from back and forth between sides,
[00:36:37] depending on depending on what the situation is, depending on how they got brimbed.
[00:36:41] But we know that there was wars between the Indians. So that's why sometimes the Indians
[00:36:49] teamed up with the soldiers, the American troops, and went and got after it with them.
[00:36:55] Yeah, is that because they got when you say brimbed, they got kind of enticed with civilization.
[00:37:01] Well, no, I'm talking about straight up, brimbed right there. They're talking about Onestab.
[00:37:04] They say, hey, Onestab, will you help guide us? Well, I don't know if I feel comfortable about that.
[00:37:08] Okay, we'll give you all the bacon, all the sugar, and all the coffee that you can carry on two horses.
[00:37:12] He says, all right, cool. My man. Yeah, and if they're worrying, you know, if that's kind of their enemy
[00:37:18] and the way you know, and let's do it. Yeah, maybe he was just, maybe he was just getting to get in some
[00:37:23] food out of what he would already like to do. Yeah, and what is it that the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[00:37:29] Hmm, there you go. Yeah, now in the black hills, they think that they find gold. They think they
[00:37:35] find gold and the black hills, and this is just a good, a good common here about, I guess you could
[00:37:41] say it's about material desires. Gold to most men means sudden wealth, big times, whiskey,
[00:37:51] and gambling, and women. It means fortune and adventure and all the things they never had. The
[00:37:59] gold fever is like taking dope. Your helpless when it strikes you. Careful that material greed.
[00:38:12] I once read about how everyone who touched an Egyptian king's tomb was doomed to die of
[00:38:19] violent death. Seems to me that the Indians must have put some curse like that on the white man who first
[00:38:26] touched their sacred black hills at this time. Custer got a lot of notoriety from his black
[00:38:32] hills expedition and the discovery of gold, but he never had any luck after that.
[00:38:39] Now, getting just a cursory look at the politics of what happened in the time, and attempt was
[00:38:54] made that summer of 75 to buy the black hills from the Indians and make legal this onslaught.
[00:39:01] But the Indians were no mood to believe anything the commissioners told them, and it was
[00:39:06] impossible to make a deal of any kind, a feeling of utter despair and despondency cast its spell
[00:39:12] over even the friendly reservation Indians. Maybe the radical things sitting bull and crazy horse
[00:39:19] and gall and two moons and the other wild chiefs far back in the buffalo lands around the
[00:39:24] powder and the big horn were preaching, maybe they made sense. The free Indian was doomed.
[00:39:30] They were all to be made reservation Indians, that meant all the colorful old life would be gone forever.
[00:39:38] The buffalo hunts, the feasts, the sun dances, the visiting, and the pleasant horse stealing
[00:39:45] wars. All the old life would be no more. Maybe those radical chiefs were right,
[00:39:52] maybe they'd all be better to make one big battle against the whites. It would be better to die
[00:39:58] a free Indian than live as a degraded, helpless treaty Indian.
[00:40:04] So evident was the hostile feeling that in the fall of 1875 that an order was submitted by the
[00:40:11] commissioner of Indian Affairs Edward P. Smith to the secretary of the interior, Z Chandler, who
[00:40:18] in turn submitted to the secretary of war, General Bell map.
[00:40:22] A subsequent communication from the secretary of interior to the secretary of war dated December 1,
[00:40:28] 1875 read as follows. I have the honor to inform you that I have this day directed the commissioner
[00:40:36] of Indian Affairs to notify said Indian sitting bull and the others outside the reservations that
[00:40:43] they must return to the reservations before January 31, 1876. And if they neglect or refuse, so to move,
[00:40:53] they will be reported to the war department as hostile Indians, and that a military force
[00:40:59] will be sent to compel them to obey the order of the Indian department.
[00:41:04] And there it is to compel them. Yep, there it is. And how, that's that, that you have to be wary
[00:41:20] of your government having so much power and leaving yourself defenseless in these situations.
[00:41:29] I think we learn a lot from the Indians, from the native Americans on that.
[00:41:38] Back to the book, General Custer was not at for Abraham Lincoln when we arrived there in late April
[00:41:45] 1876. Of course, that aroused a lot of talk and suspicion. When you jiggle all those rumors down,
[00:41:52] you got about this. We were soon to start a big expedition up to Yellowstone to round up the
[00:41:58] hostiles and drive them back to the reservations. If they would not go peacefully, we were to make
[00:42:05] good Indians out of them. There was a lot of suspicious talk going around all over the place.
[00:42:11] Custer was still in the east, so Custer had gone back to the east. And you could hear a hundred
[00:42:17] tales of how he was being kept away from the expedition because he had got under the skin of
[00:42:23] president Grant. A lot of the troopers didn't much care for Custer. But it looked as if major
[00:42:31] Reno would command the regiment if Custer didn't arrive. And most of us didn't know or care a
[00:42:36] great deal about Reno. Of course, we knew that he had been a colonel of a Pennsylvania cavalry
[00:42:42] regiment at the end of the Civil War, but he had never fought Indians. And he didn't seem to be very
[00:42:48] popular with either the men or the officers. If I remember correctly, he was a west pointer and was
[00:42:54] three or four years ahead of Custer. It was pretty clear that there wasn't much love lost between
[00:43:00] the two men. Politics. Total politics. And some of those people in the Civil War, they don't realize
[00:43:07] this stuff happens all the time. It's a politics crazy politics in the military. And just this kind of
[00:43:12] stuff right here. Oh, you're seeing you're to me. Oh, you made the other guy mad and now we're
[00:43:16] going to get pulled up and I pulled you off this operation. I'm going to let this guy go on the
[00:43:20] operation. This is just so typical of the military. Unfortunately. And you know what? It's not just
[00:43:26] typical to military. It's typical. In any company, any business, any team, there's always going to be
[00:43:31] these political things that are happening. I mean, occasionally you get to a great organization that
[00:43:36] really limits that. I shouldn't say it's everywhere, but it's very, very common. And you know,
[00:43:42] someone just asked me on Twitter, you know, hey, it's really political. I'm not really good at politics.
[00:43:48] You know, which is it something that I should actually try and engage in? I don't know. Yes.
[00:43:53] Yes, it's going to you have to. If you're in an organization that's a political organization
[00:43:57] and you want to make things happen, you want to implement changes. Yes,
[00:44:02] start figuring out how to play those games. Oh, you don't, you're not a political person. Cool
[00:44:07] become one. Yeah. Because what you want to do is you want to do a good job. You want to, you want to do
[00:44:11] good job. And whatever it is that you're doing. And sometimes that requires that you play those games.
[00:44:17] You just don't play the games. Get good at them. Back to the book. Everything was uncertain in those
[00:44:24] late April and early May days while the regiment was being whipped into marching shape.
[00:44:29] We had a few recruits, a bunch, and a bunch of fresh young horses. So there was plenty to do
[00:44:34] to break in both of them. One thing that people get wrong about the recruits was that about half of
[00:44:40] the 150 new men we had were men who either had civil war experience or had already served the
[00:44:46] five year hitch in the army. Most of the rest were plenty green. A good many of them were German
[00:44:52] boys. They made fine soldiers once they were trained. I think it was about May 10th that general
[00:44:58] custer suddenly showed up. General Terry was with him. Terry was of slight build and war whiskers.
[00:45:04] He was a gentle kindly man who never struttered in a world. Nothing at all like the quick moving
[00:45:09] dashing young custer. Terry was a brigadier general of the regular army. And so he ranked
[00:45:16] custer by two grades. Word ran around camp. The general Terry was to command the whole expedition
[00:45:22] but that custer was to have his old regiment. Custer was as happy as a boy with a new red sled.
[00:45:29] He put a lot of zip into us. Now custer, this political stuff that he's dealing with,
[00:45:38] it's still going on. It's still happening. I'm not going to go through the details of it,
[00:45:42] but he who's somehow seen as an agitator or an enemy of President Grant.
[00:45:51] And so we actually get ordered off the so he goes back out, takes back over the regiment,
[00:45:56] starts whipping people into shape. He's going to work for General Terry. Grant, President Grant,
[00:46:01] says no, actually come back. You're not, you don't get to do this. And custer decides he writes a
[00:46:11] dispatch to be sent directly to the president of the United States. That's kind of crazy.
[00:46:16] We didn't do much communications with the president from my task in the US.
[00:46:25] Here we go back to the book. And oh wait, here's, so here's what he actually sent.
[00:46:29] It's awesome. That's what's beautiful about history. This is what custer actually sent.
[00:46:33] And Grant, Grant, President Grant was a guy that was, you know, went to West Point as well.
[00:46:39] He fought in the Mexican-American War. He retired after that, which retired from the army,
[00:46:47] but then the civil war started. So he went back in the army as a general and he fought it.
[00:46:54] Shiloh and Vixberg and actually generally surrendered to President Grant. So this guy's,
[00:47:04] you know, a warrior. And here's what you're going to hear custer kind of appeal to that.
[00:47:11] Here we go. I have seen your order transmitted through the General of the army directing that I
[00:47:17] not be permitted to accompany the expedition about to move against the hostile Indians.
[00:47:23] As my entire regiment forms a part of the proposed expedition. And as I am the senior officer of
[00:47:29] the regiment on duty in the department, I respectfully but most earnestly request that I, while
[00:47:36] not allowed to go and command of the expedition. I may be permitted to serve with my regiment in the field.
[00:47:43] I appeal to you as a soldier to spare me the humiliation of seeing my regiment march to meet the
[00:47:50] enemy and I not to share its dangers. It was too much for the hero of apomotics.
[00:48:02] Custer was to have back his beloved regiment. So Grant gives in and says, okay, you can go.
[00:48:08] You're not going to be in charge, but you can go. And so they roll out on this expedition.
[00:48:16] And here's the description of what that felt like. You felt like you were somebody when you were
[00:48:23] on a good horse with a car being dangling from its small leather ring socket on your saddle and a
[00:48:29] cold army revolver strapped on your hip and a hundred rounds of ammunition in your webbelt
[00:48:34] and your saddle pockets. You were a cavalryman of the seventh regiment. You were part of a proud
[00:48:42] outfit that had a fighting reputation and you were ready for a fight or a frolic. So these guys
[00:48:49] had some pretty good morale rolling out. They did some hard training when they were in camp and now they're
[00:48:54] ready to get after it. It talks a little bit about. Custer he describes Custer.
[00:49:02] I can almost see him myself in my mind's eye. He was wearing a broad Western hat with a low
[00:49:07] crown and a wide brin. Brim, it was grayish and color. He'd had his long yellow hair cut just before we left.
[00:49:18] And he had on a buckskin suit with fringe. He had two short bill barrel bulldog revolvers and a
[00:49:24] remington sporting rifle carried in a scabbard. It's my recollection that he carried a hunting knife
[00:49:30] in a fringe to buckskin case. That's straight up rock and roll stars of the 70s war
[00:49:40] fringe on their outfits. Custer is a character. He's definitely a character. Back to the book,
[00:49:49] when the regiment was formed in Kansas in 1866 the general that went, the general went to a lot of
[00:49:55] trouble to have each troop mounted on distinct colors. I thought this was awesome so I included it.
[00:50:02] He's talking about what color horses they had and each troop had a specific colored horse.
[00:50:09] I can still call them off even at this late date. H, my own troop, road blood bays. B, D, I and L also were
[00:50:20] mounted on bays. C, G, and K had sorrows. A had coal blacks. And Lieutenant Edgely's
[00:50:29] E troop had grays. We used to call E the band box troop. M troop was the only troop that had mixed
[00:50:38] colors. The whole band rode white horses. I remember the drummer had a horse that would run away
[00:50:44] every time he mounted him except when he put his drum on him. Then that old horse would stand still
[00:50:49] as a wooden horse. It was a fine regiment right enough. And it wasn't a man in it who didn't
[00:50:56] believe it was the greatest cavalry outfit in the entire United States Army. That actually is
[00:51:05] when I hear about these guys talking about the horses we actually had little relationships like that
[00:51:10] with our humvies. We'd name them. You know we named our humvies. Yeah we named our humvies. Various
[00:51:19] names. We used to have when we used to do a lot more water work before the war started. We
[00:51:25] we actually named our outboard motors. They had little my one of my the guy that handled the outboard
[00:51:33] motors in my second platoon. He was all into it. And his nickname was Zulu. But Zulu, he was all into
[00:51:41] these motors. And he had every motor had a name and he kept these detailed log books on how many
[00:51:47] hours and when the maintenance was done all that. And when we came back from one deployment and
[00:51:51] we were going to go do another deployment. We came back. They said hey you know you guys guess what?
[00:51:56] Good news. We got all new motors. And we're going to issue you whatever it was. We had eight outboard
[00:52:01] motors. Yeah. And we're going to give you all new motor motors you know coming turn your
[00:52:06] zen and we'll send those off to wherever get repaired or going to go into the garbage can.
[00:52:11] And you know Zulu said he said I don't want the new motors. I got my motors. I know where they've been.
[00:52:18] I know their personalities. The motors have personalities. Well, the motors have personalities.
[00:52:25] And motor melodies. Yeah. They had personalities. Yeah. Motor melodies. Yeah. Motor melodies. And
[00:52:31] he wanted to make sure he had a relationship with those motors. He wanted to give them up.
[00:52:37] Going back to the book. They're starting to be out on patrol and they're marching up what's
[00:52:41] called the Rosebud. H and the five remaining troops headed down the powder and eventually arrived
[00:52:48] at the southern bank of the Yellowstone. The wagons had a tough time and it wasn't until
[00:52:53] custard taken a troop and scouting out a good road that the heavy wagons could make it.
[00:52:57] Custer was mighty good at this kind of work. He had a nose for scouting and finding the best trails.
[00:53:07] It was June. It was on June 22nd when we broke camp and started our march up the Rosebud.
[00:53:16] This just before we packed our mules, Benteen ordered us to take an extra supply of salt.
[00:53:22] That meant we might be living on mule or horse meat before we got back. I suppose we all knew
[00:53:29] by this time that we'd be hitting it into dangerous country. But as I look back, I don't believe
[00:53:36] many troopers were very worried. We knew there'd be some hard fighting, but a soldier always
[00:53:42] feels that it's the other fellow who's going to get it. Never himself. That morning,
[00:53:47] words spread about the camp, the male was going to be sent back home and that this would
[00:53:52] likely be the last chance to get off letters. Of course, I didn't have any buddy to write to,
[00:53:57] but the officers and many of the men heard least scribbled letters to their deer ones.
[00:54:04] And as they go to male off these letters, they're on a boat, the troops are on a boat,
[00:54:09] and they barely gone 50 feet with these letters to get a male off when the boat was overturned.
[00:54:16] And all three men disappeared along with the male sack.
[00:54:23] Now, here's the orders that they go get as they're going up. These are actually the orders to
[00:54:27] custard. Again, what's awesome is these are documented. This isn't the hearsay. These are documented
[00:54:32] orders. Colonel, the Brigadier General Commanding directs that as soon as your regiment can be
[00:54:39] made ready for the march you proceed up the rose bud in pursuit of the Indians who's
[00:54:44] trailed was discovered by major Reno a few days since. It is, of course, impossible to give you any
[00:54:52] definite instructions in regard to this movement. And we're not impossible to do so the department
[00:54:59] commander places too much confidence in your zeal, energy, and ability to wish to impose
[00:55:05] on you precise orders. Pretty. So he's given him, hey, look, here's my general ideas.
[00:55:10] Give him some commanders intent, but he doesn't want to give him anything too specific because
[00:55:16] he knows he can't. He has no ways going to be in two days. What's going to be happening up there?
[00:55:20] He will, however, indicate to you his own views of what action should be and desires that you should
[00:55:27] conform to them unless you should see sufficient reason for departing from them. So he gives him
[00:55:33] his orders, but he gives them some pretty good leeway to work through. That's why there's some
[00:55:37] discussion on whether or not custard disobeyed. It's a long discussion probably with no one
[00:55:46] could ever come with a solid conclusion on because there was some leeway in the orders. And
[00:55:55] those, that was the leeway that I just read, then the orders continue to go on, but I'm not going
[00:56:01] to go into those minor details of them. Back to the book, we hit the trail at five o'clock sharp
[00:56:07] that second morning. These guys are up pretty early. Probably had to get up like, I don't know,
[00:56:14] 430 to get to get to get on the road before 5 o'clock. Around noon, we began past signs of big
[00:56:22] Indian camps. As I remember, we made around 33 miles that day. The next day we rode hard to,
[00:56:30] there was no foolishness. Custer had a bunch of re and crote scouts ahead with him. And he kept
[00:56:37] them covering the ground far off both flanks of a column. We were in Indian country now right enough.
[00:56:45] So that's very common. We'd still do that today. You have a main element moving in a
[00:56:51] information and out on the flanks. Maybe some high ground. You have other smaller elements that
[00:56:57] can protect your flanks and see if there's any problems up ahead. In one place, we halted there
[00:57:03] had been a sun dance lodge. The scalp of a white man was still hanging from the ridge pole.
[00:57:11] Getting into the Indian country. It was around 8 o'clock when we got orders to saddle up.
[00:57:17] We marched about 10 miles when we were halted in the sort of ravine. We've been told to make
[00:57:22] as little noise as possible in the light no fires. There'd been no bugle calls for a day or two.
[00:57:28] The sun was at our backs. So apparently we were headed straight west now toward the little big horn.
[00:57:34] I later learned that the Indians called it greasy grass. I never did know why.
[00:57:41] About the time General Custer came back from his scout, word-run around that the Indians had found a
[00:57:46] box of hard tack that had dropped from one of Captain Yates's mules. Two or three troopers who had
[00:57:52] been sent back to pick up the box had reported seeing two hostels trying to open it with their
[00:57:58] Tomahawks. This meant that the Indians held us at us under observation. Apparently Custer had
[00:58:05] figured on hiding the command in the ravine during the day and then attacking the big Indian
[00:58:10] village on the little big horn at daybreak the next morning. So they know that the Indians know
[00:58:22] that they're there. This is why I included that. You're going to hear that kind of over and over again.
[00:58:28] Custer's thinking they're going to surprise them and everyone's telling them we're not going to
[00:58:31] surprise them. They know we're here. It was Sunday morning June 25th. We were still more than 12
[00:58:38] miles from the little horn and the Indian village but the Indians knew where we were and all about us.
[00:58:48] I approached, I approached his nearer that now so he sees a conversation going on and it's actually
[00:58:55] Custer and Ben Tene and they're having a conversation with a couple people including some of the
[00:58:59] scouts and he kind of goes over and does a little ease dropping. As I approached, as Neira seemed
[00:59:04] respectful and while I was waiting to catch Ben Tene's attention, I couldn't help but over here
[00:59:08] part of the conversation. Charlie Reynolds, the famous white scout who was never to see the sunset
[00:59:14] that day was talking and I heard him say that there was the biggest bunch of Indians he'd ever
[00:59:20] seen over there. Finally I heard Ben Tene say to Custer, hadn't we better keep the regiment together
[00:59:27] general? If this is a big camp as they say, we'll need to every man we have. Custer's only answer
[00:59:34] was you have your orders. So you can see again Custer is not listening to people, scouts,
[00:59:48] reconnaissance units and his other officers that are with him and this is sort of the classic.
[00:59:57] You know hey I've got a, I disagree with your plan shut up and do it anyways. You have your order. So that's a
[01:00:02] classic example that we were tired and dirty and hungry or horses hadn't had a good drink of
[01:00:12] water since the day before and we weren't much better off. We knew right enough that this was the day.
[01:00:20] This was it. This was what we've been training and working for all these years. Captain Ben Tene used
[01:00:26] to say the government pays you to get shot at and I suppose the dumbest greenest trooper in
[01:00:31] the regiment figured that this day he'd get shot at plenty. Here was the seventh cavalry
[01:00:45] with a total of some 600 men split up into four outfits. Apparently the Indian scouts
[01:00:53] and experienced old guys, guides knew that there were several thousand of the hostels but it was
[01:01:03] it is my belief that Custer and most of our officers thought that after whips somewhere between
[01:01:08] a thousand and fifteen hundred and they expected most of these to be poorly armed and poorly led.
[01:01:15] From experience they figured the Indians would fight only a rear guard action while the women,
[01:01:20] children, old men and pony herds got away but in place of a maximum of fifteen hundred
[01:01:27] Indian warriors it developed that there were possibly twice that number about to face Custer's total of
[01:01:32] 600. So that's the report that they're getting and it's there's a little bit of controversy about
[01:01:46] what how many Indians were there but it was a lot and here here we go this I'm going to jump
[01:01:53] forward to another section and talking about Custer and did Custer the name of the chapter is
[01:01:59] did Custer and it's sort of a appendix so it's not part of the story it's after the story but it
[01:02:04] talks about did Custer refuse advice from his scouts how many Indian warriors were camped on the
[01:02:10] West Bank of the Little Big Horn that Sunday morning of June 25th against the real figure how many
[01:02:16] Custer think he would have to fight did Custer refuse to believe the estimated number of warriors
[01:02:21] his scouts told him he would have to fight did he fail to follow the advice of his experienced
[01:02:26] guides and interpreters one of the best accounts of what the guides thought about the number of
[01:02:31] Indians and the chances of Custer closing with them is contained in the excellent book William Jackson
[01:02:38] Indian Scout by James William Schultz, Willard Schultz, it is worth careful reading and here's a
[01:02:45] couple excerpts from that on the third day we struck the trail of the hostels the one that Reno had
[01:02:53] found several days before said bloody knife now remember bloody knife is is Custer's you know
[01:03:02] main scout their their type said bloody knife my friends the bit this big trail proves what we heard
[01:03:13] that the Ogalala the Minicon Jew the Sandsark and the Teton Sue have left their agencies to
[01:03:22] join sitting bull and crazy horse horse I'm sure that even this trail does not account for all
[01:03:28] that have left their agencies they're surely our other trails and trails two of the shy ants and the
[01:03:36] apraprohose bloody knife continued it is as I have told long hair this gathering of enemy tribes
[01:03:47] is too many for us but he will not believe me he is bound to lead us against them they are not far away
[01:03:56] just over this ridge they are all in camp and waiting for us crazy horse and sitting bull are not
[01:04:02] men without sense they have their scouts too and some of them surely have their eyes upon us
[01:04:08] well tomorrow we are going to have a big fight a losing fight myself I know what is to happen to me
[01:04:16] my sacred helper is giving me warning that I am not to see the set of tomorrow's sun
[01:04:21] sad words those they chilled us I saw Charlie Reynolds nod and agreement to them
[01:04:30] and was chilled again when he said in a low voice I feel as he does tomorrow will be the end for me too
[01:04:38] anyone who wants my little outfit of stuff pointing to his war pack can have it now
[01:04:46] lieutenant Varna who is in charge of the scouts came over and said that it was general
[01:04:50] custards planned to attempt to surprise attack on the camp of the enemy said bloody knife
[01:04:56] we cannot surprise the enemy they are not crazy without dumb without doubt their scouts have
[01:05:04] watched every move we have made convinced at last that we could not possibly surprise the
[01:05:15] enemy general custer ordered a quick advance with the scouts and himself in the lead
[01:05:23] we had not gone far when bloody knife and his two reeds joined us and reported that on the other
[01:05:27] side of the ridge they had found the day old trail of many more enemy going toward the valley of
[01:05:32] little big horn they were excited and said to custer general we have discovered the camp
[01:05:39] down there on the little big horn it is a big one too big for you to tackle why there are
[01:05:44] thousands and thousands of sue and shions down there for moment the general stared at him
[01:05:50] angley I thought and then said sternly I shall attack them classic ego maniac right here sorry but
[01:06:01] that's what this is yeah custer gave orders for attack upon the camp none of the scouts had
[01:06:10] been far in the lead and they all came in reeds and crows and whites and Robert and I we were
[01:06:16] gathering of solemn faces speaking in English and the sign language too so that all would understand
[01:06:23] brood described the enemy camp it was he said all of three miles long and made up of hundreds of
[01:06:30] lodges hundreds and hundreds of lodges above it and below it and west of it there were thousands
[01:06:36] and thousands of horses that were being close herded with his few riders long hair decided to
[01:06:42] attack the camp and we were going to have a terrible fight we should all take courage fight hard
[01:06:49] make our every shot a killer he finished a nun spoke but after a minute or two bloody knife
[01:06:57] looked up and signed to the sun I shall not see you go down behind the mountains tonight
[01:07:03] and that that I almost choked I felt he knew his end was near and there was no escaping it
[01:07:10] I turned and looked the other way I thought that my own end was near I felt very sad
[01:07:18] so there's the full account of these all the scouts some are you know some are white
[01:07:25] some are Indian Native Americans different tribes and they're all telling them the same thing
[01:07:30] hmm this is not a good plan so back to the book apparently cost her had planned to stay in hiding
[01:07:40] in the ravine we had reached a little after 10 o'clock that Sunday and then attacked the
[01:07:45] village a daybreak the next morning of the 26 that would more or less have doubled tailed
[01:07:49] and deterries idea of boxing the Indians but when he found the hostile scouts had discovered his
[01:07:55] column he figured there was nothing to do but attack it once
[01:08:08] now we get a little um a little report here from a guy named
[01:08:15] Sergeant Daniel Knapp who had barely turned 23 at the time of the battle in Knapp's own account
[01:08:24] of the fight published in the magazine of the historical society of Montana he said when we got to
[01:08:30] the top of the buffs the Indians had disappeared but we were in plain view of the Indian camps which
[01:08:36] appeared to cover a space of about two miles wide and four miles long on the west side of the river
[01:08:43] we were then charging at full speed this camp is two miles wide that's a map two miles
[01:08:51] two but it four two by four miles and you got 600 guys and actually they didn't even
[01:08:56] cost her to have six of her guys to get 200 guys Reno and his troops were again seen to our
[01:09:04] left moving at full speed down the valley at the site of the Indian camps the boys of our five
[01:09:09] troops began to cheer over confidence some of the horses became so excited that the riders were
[01:09:16] unable to hold them in ranks and the last word I heard general custer say were hold your
[01:09:21] horses in boys there are plenty of them down there for all of us again now we have total
[01:09:27] overconfidence in the situation we think we're gonna win this is gonna be fun oh there's a
[01:09:32] two by four mile big camp no big deal I got 500 guys with me so this is where the force is split up
[01:09:41] and custer goes off to attack it seems like he goes about a mile away mile and a half away
[01:09:47] and again I'm gonna make the same statement that I said when I talked about the battle with
[01:09:51] when we did the wooden leg podcast I'm not trying to historically reconstruct the battle right now
[01:09:57] there's plenty of books that do that so I'm just kind of assembling the broad design of what's happening
[01:10:07] so now the forces split up Reno and Benteen are kind of have troops and holding but they're
[01:10:13] starting to get a little firefight themselves we saw a second figure in uniform writing towards us
[01:10:19] he was trumpeter martini of my company who had been assigned that morning as a special orderly
[01:10:25] trumpeter to general custer I learned afterwards that he had a message from custer to Benteen
[01:10:31] that had been scribbled out on a field order pad and signed by lieutenant cook the agitant
[01:10:37] it read Benteen come on big village be quick bring packs yes bring pack so that's the note
[01:10:49] that they get from custer sounds like custer might have once he split off things started going sideways real
[01:10:57] quick they again Benteen and Reno have their troops start now getting engaged in a firefight
[01:11:08] back to the book we could hear heavy firing now before long we passed several crow or re-scouts
[01:11:13] driving a few head of Indian ponies and they shouted soldiers in pointed toward the
[01:11:17] bluffs that were rising towards the north we knew that we were close to the valley of little big
[01:11:22] horn and that's somewhere in this neighborhood there was hard fighting going on
[01:11:25] Benteen ordered us to draw pistols and we charged up the bluffs that had gallop expecting at any moment
[01:11:31] to run into hostels when we reached the brow with the first set of rolling hills the river valley
[01:11:37] suddenly opened up below us to our left it was a sight to strike terror in the hearts of the
[01:11:43] bravest men down there in the valley maybe 150 feet or more below us and somewhere around a half
[01:11:50] a mile away there were figure galloping on horseback and much shooting farther down the river there were
[01:11:56] great masses of mounted men we suspicion were Indians we were going at it at fast clip ourselves
[01:12:04] and we had no more than caught the swift glimpse of this tragic battlefield below when we saw
[01:12:11] mounted and dismounted soldiers on a null of a hill onto the northward we swiftly rode towards them
[01:12:17] so these guys are seeing this massive battle take place they're kind of on the high ground
[01:12:26] he talks about here what kind of weaponry the the Indians had for my part I believe that fully
[01:12:35] half of the warriors carried only bows and arrows and lances and that possibly half of the
[01:12:41] remainder carried odds and end of old muzzle loaders and single shot rifles of various
[01:12:45] vintage's probably not more than 25 or 30% of the warriors carried modern repeating rifles that
[01:12:51] sounds pretty close to what wooden legs said they said they mostly had bows and arrows they
[01:12:56] some guys had rifles but it was mostly bows and arrows and one other port Indian boys from 14
[01:13:02] years old up accompanied the warriors and took part especially in the later stages of the fighting
[01:13:08] the soldiers incidentally were armed with single shot 45 70 caliber springfield carbines and
[01:13:14] accurate and deadly weapon up to 600 yards but when fired rapidly the breach became foul and the
[01:13:21] greasy cartridges is often jammed it could not be removed by the extractor this meant that the
[01:13:26] empty shell had to be forced out by the blade of a hunting knife this very fact was responsible for
[01:13:32] the death of many a trooper this hot Sunday and may actually have been the indirect cause of the
[01:13:37] great disaster weapons getting dirty weapons getting hot dirty got to take care of your weapon it sounds
[01:13:44] like this was beyond them just taking care of their weapon sounds like it was a design issue as well
[01:13:52] Reno had crossed the river and had his troops in line of columns of four with the Indian
[01:13:59] with the Indian scouts on his left soon Indian horsemen were seen riding madly two and
[01:14:04] throw in the valley and shortly the southern end of the Indian camps came in to view Reno now
[01:14:12] had his three troops and scouts thrown out in a skirmish line covering possibly the full width of the
[01:14:17] narrow valley so there they see the enemy now they get online that's a very common thing if you can picture
[01:14:23] this you've got your guys in a column how many if you're in a column of three three columns and you
[01:14:30] see the enemy ahead of you how many people do you think can shoot the three the three the three of
[01:14:36] the front so that's why you keep hearing this this idea of a skirmish line and it's the same tactic
[01:14:40] that we use now oh we got enemy in front of us cool we're gonna get online they call it a skirmish line here
[01:14:45] we would call it a get online like they'll they spread out red on the yep so now they get they got
[01:14:52] 50 guys cool that 50 guns online instead of three yeah realizing that this charged toward the
[01:14:59] Indian hordes would end in almost certain disaster Reno now orders troops to dismount and fight on foot
[01:15:05] even before this order came scores of Indians had swung to the southwestward and pressed against
[01:15:11] the crow and re-scouts these were forced to give way things were looking bad for Reno any
[01:15:17] order to skirmish lines to fall back to the edge of a heavy grove of cotton woods that followed
[01:15:22] a bend in the river and jutted out halfway across the valley the horses were led into the woods
[01:15:27] wall a thin line of man held three sides of the grove some 90 men were holding not less than 250 yards
[01:15:34] of line hundreds of mounted Indians were now half circling the skirmish line writing in close
[01:15:40] firing from under their ponies next and then galloping away Reno's men were now either firing
[01:15:46] from a prone position or using the bank of a dry creek bed as a bearer create and rifle rest
[01:15:51] so Reno's guys are now getting basically surrounded in taking up this new position sergeant or
[01:15:58] hair of troop m had been killed the first man on the skirmish line to die apparently Reno had a
[01:16:04] fairly defendable position and some people think if he had pulled in his lines and consolidated
[01:16:09] in his position he might have held out here for an indefinite length of time or at least as long
[01:16:15] as his ammunition lasted but the savage yells the heavy firing the smoke and dust all and fear
[01:16:22] all combined to fog his judgment suddenly custers favorite scout bloody knife was shot through
[01:16:30] the head and his brain scattered all over Reno then the scout dorm in fell and Charlie Reynolds
[01:16:37] was shot through the head Reno figuring that his only chance lay and getting to high ground across
[01:16:43] the river shattered for his men to mount up in company formation two troop commanders heard the order
[01:16:49] and amid the confusion and excitement had their men mount up and line in column of force
[01:16:55] the third troop G under Lieutenant Mackintosh himself part Indian who had been adopted by
[01:17:01] general Mackintosh was in the woods and did not get the order until the two other troops
[01:17:06] with Reno writing at their head were racing upstream trying to find a place to cross the river
[01:17:11] all order and discipline were gone so they're surrounded things fall apart he's basically saying
[01:17:20] we got a retreat we got to get out of here and the assessment was that maybe they were in a
[01:17:25] defendable position they could have held there who knows who knows whether that's true or not
[01:17:32] nobody will ever know how any man escaped alive from this mad retreat
[01:17:37] all we are sure of is that the charging troop broke through the cordon of mounted Indians
[01:17:43] and followed a buffalo craft to the river here they somehow managed to jump their horses
[01:17:49] over a four or five foot bank plunged across the stream and scrambled up a narrow trail
[01:17:55] to the steep hills to the east hundreds of Indians fired indiscriminately into the pan
[01:18:00] extra consulgers and the wonder is that any trooper escaped no motion picture could be as fantastic
[01:18:08] as this wild milling of frightened men and horses again just to remind you that this is what's
[01:18:18] happening with Reno in his group they don't know where customers right now with his crew of
[01:18:22] 200 guys back to the book in all 26 troopers and scouts and three officers were killed
[01:18:30] either in this ride through the Indian gauntlet or back at the edge of the woods
[01:18:35] of the 19 men left behind 17 cross the river and reached Reno Hill on foot within two hours
[01:18:44] Lieutenant Darudio and private O'Neill did not join us until 36 hours later
[01:18:50] they came right through where I was on guard it was now somewhere around 330 in the afternoon
[01:18:56] Reno shaken and unnerved and reached the hilltop and here his frightened troopers were joining him
[01:19:04] he was whipped and completely disorganized
[01:19:10] this is a rally point and if you have a pre-designated rally point
[01:19:16] and you say hey guys look you see this big hill over here if everything goes to hell
[01:19:20] again we get all jumbled up go to that point it doesn't sound like he actually pre-brief that
[01:19:27] because that would have been a you could have just said hey back to the rally point you could have
[01:19:30] been a very clear order if you're trying to not really know where you're going and you're saying
[01:19:35] retreat well you don't do it in a very organized fashion so pre-plants some contingencies
[01:19:40] hmm now they get in this position and Reno like I said is in rough shape back to the book cool
[01:19:53] capable bending more or less assumed command major Runu Reno had just come through a terrible
[01:19:59] experience and at the moment was glad to have bending his junior take over quickly bending
[01:20:06] dismounted his own three troops and ordered us to form a scourmet line Reno's men had
[01:20:11] expanded most of their ammunition so we were told to divide ours with them we had bantines 120
[01:20:17] men intact and there were around 60 men who'd been fighting in the valley with Reno
[01:20:25] and even before we got the kinks out of our legs from our long horse hours in the saddle
[01:20:29] we were asking each other where's custard what had become of custer and his five
[01:20:35] troops apparently custer was now much farther on to the northward and in this moment was
[01:20:44] hotly engaged but no one was certain all we knew was that he had disappeared with almost half the
[01:20:49] regiment we could hear the sound of distant firing echoing through the hills and valleys from that
[01:20:56] direction custer must be down there so this is happening they're in the skirmish position
[01:21:03] and they're starting to try and get reorganized back to the book the wounded man who could
[01:21:11] mount were put on horses but the others were carried in blankets by details of six troopers on foot
[01:21:18] takes a lot of people to carry a downman downman takes a lot of people to carry a downman and in
[01:21:23] this case it takes six people to carry one downman nowadays we weigh a lot more we got we got all
[01:21:31] reguns we got body armor it's hot guys are heavy pretty soon it looked as if the Indian
[01:21:40] masses were coming towards us it didn't take long to realize that this was true here we were
[01:21:46] stretched out all over hell's half acre a troop on this hill mob another in this little valley
[01:21:52] in a third and over there a third troop behind at a slow walk came packed trains the wounded men
[01:22:00] and the rear guard we know and venting both sense danger in order to withdraw the advanced
[01:22:06] troops were dismounting and fought as skirmishers in the center in a slight depression the horses
[01:22:14] and mules were staked and an inadequate little field hospital was established but it was impossible
[01:22:22] to shield the man and stock from the Indians firing from a hilltop off to the east in the
[01:22:27] Indians got some high ground on them can't stop them what do you think I got high ground you you can't
[01:22:32] hide animal after animals killed and the men were hit it was tough not to be able to do something
[01:22:38] about it we'd hardly got settled on our own skirmish line with h men posted at 20 foot intervals
[01:22:46] when the Indians at all but completely surrounded us and the fighting began in earnest there was
[01:22:53] no full fledged charge but little groups of Indians would creep up as close as they could get
[01:22:58] and from behind bushes or little noils open fire they'd practiced all kinds of cute tricks to
[01:23:04] draw our fire maybe a naked red skin would suddenly jump to his feet and while you drew a
[01:23:08] beat on him he'd thrown himself to the ground they're under this attack for a pretty good amount
[01:23:18] of time and then finally the sun went down that night like a ball of fire pretty soon the quick
[01:23:26] Montana twilight settled down on us and then came the chill of the high planes there was no moon
[01:23:33] and no one ever welcomed darkness more than we did we felt terribly alone on that dangerous hilltop
[01:23:40] we were million miles from nowhere and death was all around us all through that short black night
[01:23:49] the orgy went on down below in the river valley it struck fear in our hearts just as the
[01:23:55] mystery of custards disappearance made our blood run cold each time we tried to solve it where was
[01:24:01] custer what had happened to him so down they're up there they're hiding it's dark
[01:24:08] they're scared they got wounded and all they hear down in the valley is the Indians going crazy
[01:24:14] the rhythm of the tom tom's the wild victory dance they can hear all this
[01:24:22] back to the book they're talking about custer they could not all be killed not lucky
[01:24:26] custer and those five gallant troops who rolled with him why did he abandon us in those three
[01:24:32] bloody hours before darkness had saved us we had no less than a dozen men killed and three times
[01:24:37] that number wounded he's actually saying man where was custer here we were getting crushed on the
[01:24:44] battlefield and custer's not there to support us where to go now during the night it rains a little
[01:24:53] bit and finally the sun starts to come up and just as the sun starts to come up and starts
[01:25:00] getting light back to the book Joan said something about taking off his overcoat he started to roll
[01:25:06] on his side so he could get his arms and shoulders out without exposing himself to fire suddenly
[01:25:12] I heard him cry out he'd been shot straight through the heart minute or two later another bullet
[01:25:20] from the hilltop torn to the hickory butt of my rifle splitting it squarely into I was plenty
[01:25:26] mad because my army carbine wouldn't let me return the compliment so he just got shot the rifle
[01:25:32] stock actually happened one of my guys in in Ramadi one of my guys got his his rifle stock up
[01:25:39] blown up by an RPG I seem to come fall out of a sniper position and he's got his his weapon
[01:25:46] is in two pieces I'm thinking no lucky to be alive along about this time our 30 or 40 wounded men
[01:25:58] began crying out for water h-trupe held the hill here on the southwest there was a draw that
[01:26:05] ran down the west side of the hill to the river it was a rough and exposed and it looked like a
[01:26:09] dead cinch that anyone who tried to work his way down that drug the river would be killed
[01:26:15] Indians concealed in the bushes across the river were firing up at us and they had every foot of
[01:26:20] this draw on riverbank covered but we had to do something for those men who were up wounded crying
[01:26:27] for water finally benteen called for volunteers I think there were 17 of us all together who step forward
[01:26:36] he detailed four of us from h who were extra good marksman to take up an exposed position on the
[01:26:42] brow of the hill facing the river we were to stand up and not only draw the fire of the Indians
[01:26:48] below but we were to pump as much lettuce we could into the bushes where the Indians were hiding
[01:26:52] while the water party hurried down to the draw got their buckets and pots and canteens filled
[01:26:57] and then made their way back so we got a little cover move happening obviously it just happened that
[01:27:04] the four of us who were posted on the hill were all German boys, Giger, Meckling, Voight and myself
[01:27:11] none of us were for wounded although we stood exposed on that ridge for more than 20 minutes
[01:27:16] and they threw plenty of lettuce several of the water party however were badly wounded although
[01:27:21] we kept the steady fire into the bushes where the Indians were hiding each of us was given a
[01:27:27] congressional metal of honor you don't think about that you don't think about you you actually
[01:27:34] gonna need water you run out of water you're gonna get guys dehydrated and a dinosaur you're
[01:27:38] gonna risk people's lives to go get water benteen had been walking up and down the line urging
[01:27:46] men to hold fast not to waste their fire and to keep cool I remember saying to him Colonel you
[01:27:52] better get down sir you'll get killed don't worry about me he answered grimly I'm all right
[01:27:58] he sure lived a charmed life that day but things look bad and finally benteen hurried to the
[01:28:04] north side of the lines and asked major reno for reinforcements he made it clear that the Indians were
[01:28:09] about to charge his line and if they were able to sweep over it the whole outfit would be destroyed
[01:28:15] reno told him to take as much of mtrupe as he could gather those men certainly look good to us
[01:28:20] soon after they came up captain benteen led the charge yelling and firing we went at the double
[01:28:27] quick and the Indians broken ran when we had cleaned them out for a hundred yards ahead of us
[01:28:33] we hustled back to our holes once again we settled back to the business of getting fired at
[01:28:37] with men hit at intervals with men hit at intervals and with the poor horses and mules taking a
[01:28:44] terrible beating in their hollow it must have been a long time about long about this time that
[01:28:49] benteen called me to attention and made me sergeant we had one sergeant two men killed and 12
[01:28:55] wounded and aged treep alone so once again we see some aggressive and we also see some focus
[01:29:03] of forces right we see some prior exercise next to you hey we're gonna get over run this our
[01:29:07] biggest problem right now is we're gonna get over run so you know what hey major reno give me a
[01:29:11] bunch of guys and we're gonna go do an aggressive assault and take care of this number one priority
[01:29:15] so let's focus our forces on that here we go and that's what they did they got aggressive and got after it
[01:29:23] back to the book the gun fired almost ceased and some of us left our trenches and stood in
[01:29:27] little groups on the brow of the hill then something happened that I'll never forget if I lived to be
[01:29:32] a hundred the heavy smokes seem to lift for a few moments and they're in the valley below we
[01:29:38] caught glimpses of the thousands of Indians on foot and horseback with their pony hordes
[01:29:43] with their pony herds dogs and pack animals and all the trappings of a great camp solely
[01:29:49] moving southward it was like some biblical Exodus the Israelites moving into Egypt's a mighty
[01:29:57] tribe on the march we thought at first that it must be some trick that the Indians were only
[01:30:02] moving their families from danger and that the warriors would soon return and try to overwhelm us
[01:30:08] patiently we waited in our little trenches along June afternoon dragged on the firing at all
[01:30:14] but ceased the smoke in the valley had blown away and the last Indian had gone
[01:30:23] then reno ordered the whole camp to move as close to the river as possible we would get as far as
[01:30:28] ways we could from the terrible stench of death there was plenty of water now for the wounded
[01:30:34] and towards the evening the company cooks made us the best meal they could at least we had
[01:30:40] hot coffee and plenty of bacon and so card tack it was our first meal in 36 hours then night came
[01:30:49] down we were weary but while those on guard were awake and alert the rest of the command slept
[01:30:56] but it was an uneasy sleep we still had heard no word from costor we began to suspicion
[01:31:03] that some terrible fate might have overtaken him what it was we could only guess
[01:31:15] the sun was well in the sky that next morning of the 27th we saw dust rising slowly from the
[01:31:20] valley northward so then they get approached by a young officer that had been out scouting what was
[01:31:27] happening a young officer phung himself off his horse he was lieutenant Bradley chief of scouts
[01:31:34] early this morning scouting in the hills on the east side a little horn lieutenant Bradley had
[01:31:39] come across a battlefield dotted with the white bodies of dead men he had counted more than 190 dead
[01:31:45] he was certain that costor was among them apparently no white man had escaped one or two
[01:31:52] crow scouts notably young curly had reported at the steamer far west at the junction of little
[01:31:58] big horn and big horn the day before there had been no interpreter on hand but curly had to
[01:32:05] convince the officers that all white soldiers who rode with custard had been killed at dawn
[01:32:11] lieutenant Bradley in a few men and a few men had started out to search for the field of tragedy
[01:32:16] curly was right no soldier a white man had escaped a little later the slight figure
[01:32:24] of bearded general Terry with his staff and a small escort arrived on the hill
[01:32:30] there were tears running down as cheeks when he spoke I think most of us had tears in our eyes
[01:32:35] too more than 200 of our comrades had met a violent death and now naked and unbearied were lying
[01:32:42] in the hot Montana 7 3 miles northward so they go out to recover the bodies or bury the bodies
[01:32:57] their own patrol back to the book suddenly we caught glimpses of white objects lying along
[01:33:02] the ridge that led northward we pulled up our horses this was the battlefield here
[01:33:10] custard's lap luck had finally run out from the way the men lay it was clear that the first
[01:33:17] one troop had been ordered to dismount and fight as a skirmish line then a second troop had been
[01:33:23] posted a little further on and to the east then a third troop and a fourth and finally
[01:33:30] there on the knob of a hill lay some 30 bodies in a small circle we knew instinctively
[01:33:37] we would find custard there we rode forward at a walk most of the troopers had been stripped of clothing
[01:33:43] and scalp some of them had been horribly mutilated custard was lying a trifle to the southeast
[01:33:50] of the top of the no where the monument is today i stood six feet away holding cap and bent
[01:33:58] teens horse while he had identified the general his body had not been touched save for a single bullet
[01:34:04] hole in the left temple near the ear and a hole on his left breast he looked almost as if it
[01:34:11] had been peaceably sleeping his brother Tom lay a few feet away he was terribly mutilated
[01:34:18] scattered over the field where the swollen bodies of the dead horses but there were not many of them
[01:34:24] it seemed clear that the Indians sweeping up from the draws and coolees on all sides had
[01:34:29] stampeded the mounts while the men were fighting dismounted from every direction
[01:34:34] hordes of crazed Indians must have attacked with the wild courage that their desperation and
[01:34:40] hate gave them nothing could check their mad charges captain bentine found a bit of wood
[01:34:48] hollowed out a hole found an empty shell wrote custer's name on a bit of paper
[01:34:54] and placed it in the shell and shoved the deep in the hole in the piece of wood then he pushed
[01:35:00] this into the ground at custer's head it would make sure that the burial party would identify
[01:35:06] custer's body the following morning we went back to custer hill and buried as well as we could
[01:35:14] the naked mutilated bodies of our comrades it was a gruesome task the custer may have made a
[01:35:23] mistake to divide his command that Sunday afternoon of June 25th but the gods themselves were against him
[01:35:32] it was the Indians day
[01:35:35] and I'm gonna go back to finish this up to the section of the book that we started at
[01:35:48] and that is this account from majorino who we know a little bit more about now
[01:35:55] but
[01:35:55] I think that the way he wraps it up and they actually did a massive trial
[01:36:05] a big trial for Reno and they found that the actions that he took were not negligent
[01:36:10] he might have made some calls that might not have been the best tactical to call as if you look back
[01:36:15] on it but he was basically cleared of any wrongdoing clearly clearly I think it's pretty clear
[01:36:26] that wind off things you know he broke and he lost control of his troops and then
[01:36:32] banteen kind of took over and got things squared away okay clearly clearly wind off was also a
[01:36:38] huge fan of banteen so he might be spending that story a little bit in that direction but
[01:36:43] I do think that Reno I think that him looking back on the incident and he kind of wraps up
[01:36:50] his assessment of what happened and what went wrong that day and also I think for lack of a better word
[01:36:59] that there is a there's a warning of sorts in this so here's Reno
[01:37:07] after much reflection I've concluded that several great blunders were the direct causes
[01:37:15] of the custer massacre it is an established fact that custer disobeyed the orders of the general
[01:37:22] in command of the expedition for instead of waiting to meet general given in general Terry on June 26
[01:37:28] at the rosebud and then cooperate with them and their concerted plan of action as he had been
[01:37:33] directed as soon as he struck the trail of the Indians he followed it until he came upon the
[01:37:38] Indian village June 25th then without attempting to communicate with either Terry or given
[01:37:45] and without taking the trouble to ascertain the strength or positions of the Indians he divided
[01:37:51] his regiment into three separate battalions an act which nothing can justify and dashed against the
[01:37:58] Indians thus recklessly driving his own and my commands into an ambuscade of five thousand soon.
[01:38:08] Nor did custer take into consideration the unfed and exhausted conditions of the men and his
[01:38:15] horses and he entirely ignored the fact that the Indians were key Viva and ready for the attack at noon
[01:38:24] whereas it would have been an easy matter to surprise them very early in the morning.
[01:38:30] The only explanation for such conduct on the part of so brilliant an officer as custer undoubtedly
[01:38:36] was otherwise was his great personal ambition. He had fought himself partially disgraced because
[01:38:47] he had been superseded in command of the expedition by general Terry and it was well-known that he was
[01:38:54] resolved if possible to carry off all the honors of the campaign for being in command of the
[01:39:02] only cavalry regiment attached the expedition he knew the brunt to the fighting would necessarily
[01:39:07] fall on him and he made it no secret of his intention to cut loose from Terry where there was
[01:39:13] fighting to be due to be done and to carry on the campaign on his own hook.
[01:39:20] Absolutely insensible to fear he was so reckless and daring in the extreme and driven by an
[01:39:28] intense desire to distinguish himself by some brilliant exploit made his head long dash
[01:39:37] to a horrible death without the most causal regard for the maximums of military prudence.
[01:39:46] Even now after the lapse of nearly 10 years the horror of custer's battlefield is still vividly
[01:39:58] before me. The harrowing site of those mutilated and decomposing bodies crowning the heights on which
[01:40:05] poor custer fell will linger in my memory till death.
[01:40:23] And I think that's a pretty clear one. And of course there are military lessons to be learned
[01:40:33] from this account of the battle of little big horned maintain the element of surprise.
[01:40:40] Keep your forces unified as much as possible taken maintain the high ground.
[01:40:48] The rule we should always follow trust your reconnaissance units you've got them out there listen
[01:40:54] to them. Make sure your troops are rested and fed and have water. But beyond those
[01:41:06] fundamental military tactical lessons I think it becomes quite clear that there is another
[01:41:15] enemy that we must always be on the watch for. Then that is ego. Our own ego. We have to keep our
[01:41:30] ego in check. You have to watch out for it. Guard against it getting control of you and interfering
[01:41:36] with your decision making process. Now I always say this. This doesn't mean that ego should be banished.
[01:41:48] It absolutely has a very positive side as well. It drives us to push hard. It drives us to do our best.
[01:41:57] And a guy like custer who personally led cavalry charges at the battle of Gettysburg
[01:42:05] that were critical in stopping flanking actions from Confederate troops and action that no doubt
[01:42:13] was fueled by courage and bravery. But also was fueled at some level.
[01:42:26] Because ego is a driver of our actions and sometimes it can be a positive driver of our actions.
[01:42:32] But it has to be balanced. It has to be balanced by humility and open ears and open mind.
[01:42:44] Keep the ego in check. I'll tell you something else. Like your ego,
[01:42:51] so another lesson from this is that you have to keep your emotions in check and you heard the brutality
[01:43:03] that was committed in these wars on both sides. Both sides. Anger and fear and frustration.
[01:43:15] And those result in escalation on both sides. And on both sides there were truly horrific acts
[01:43:29] of savagery. And that's an extreme example. This whole story is an extreme example of both those.
[01:43:39] Both the ego and the emotional mayhem that are shown in this example are very extreme.
[01:43:49] But also think about how they relate to your everyday life. How often do you let your ego
[01:44:00] get in the way of making the right decision? How often do you let your emotions drive your decisions?
[01:44:10] How often do you go to war? Because of your emotions and because of your ego. How often
[01:44:19] do you go to war? Because of them. And what I'm saying is stop.
[01:44:25] Stop doing. Get control of your emotions and get control of your ego and put them in check.
[01:44:35] So you aren't escalating to situations where you savage your enemy or your friends or your
[01:44:43] coworkers or your peers or your family or whoever you do nothing in those situations to further
[01:44:48] your mission in life. But instead you just distract and detract from reaching your real goals.
[01:45:01] Don't let that happen. Learn, learn from this particular battle. See what the emotions and
[01:45:11] ego do and find a better way. Deescalate. The build coalitions with people instead of building
[01:45:26] bloodfumes. Work with people instead of working against people, lift people up instead of
[01:45:37] casting them down. And in short, what that is is leading. That is what true leadership is and
[01:45:51] that is what a true leader does. So go out there and do it. And I think that's all I've got for
[01:46:13] tonight. Just a brutal situation that this is. I actually pull up some other quotes too.
[01:46:27] Beginning the book, I talked about some of these massacres that were considered
[01:46:31] committed by the soldiers in some of these raids. And this is a one right here. John S. Smith
[01:46:40] from his congressional testimony. This is from the Sand Creek massacre. By the way, I saw the
[01:46:46] bodies of those lying there cut all the pieces. Worst mutilated than any I ever saw before the
[01:46:53] women cut to pieces with knives, scout their brains knocked out, children two or three months old.
[01:47:00] All ages lying there from sucking infants up to warriors.
[01:47:05] By whom were they mutilated? By United States troops. And again, this might my point in
[01:47:20] bringing that up is that it's the escalation of emotions and the escalation of ego. And I'm
[01:47:29] going to pay them back and we so often drive ourselves to these situations in everyday life.
[01:47:34] I mean, obviously not to this scale. But how do we overcome that? And I think you got to
[01:47:41] concentrate on keeping your ego and your emotions in check. Yeah. Yeah, and there's also that slippery
[01:47:48] slope factor where like remember the the one I think it was I think was me lie where we're talking
[01:47:58] about the slippery slope and kind of one thing leads to another where if you kind of look at the
[01:48:03] end the result you're like no way I would never do that. I would never be in that situation.
[01:48:09] But it starts like with one little thing. You know, so from one step to the to the next step or the
[01:48:15] for one little step where you slide or on the slippery slope it's like that's easy. You know where
[01:48:21] it's like all right one guy gets mad he slaps this guy, you know, or even I mean it goes really
[01:48:27] with anything with the slippery slope anything like cheating on your diet. I don't know it it does.
[01:48:32] And what we're really talking about is what's the cure to the slippery slope? It's the discipline.
[01:48:38] It's maintaining the discipline. It's maintaining the personal discipline. What you're talking about like
[01:48:41] I outs the slippery slope going down the donut slope. Yeah. Right. We don't want to do that.
[01:48:46] But on top of that you get into a leadership situation. Absolutely. It's a slippery slope.
[01:48:51] And you give that little bit you think, oh, you know, it's no big deal. I like that guy. Hey, he's
[01:48:55] going, he got a little angry. That's okay. But everybody else saw that happen. And now you're just
[01:49:01] allowing this to happen and it's only going to escalate. But it's so and think about this.
[01:49:06] Think about how easy it is to stop that one thing and say, hey, echo what are you doing? Come over here.
[01:49:11] Hey, look, we don't hit prisoners. Stop what you're doing. Yeah. Get it together. If you're mad,
[01:49:15] go over there, take a breath. Yeah. That's pretty easy for me to stop. Now what happens when you shoot
[01:49:21] somebody? Now we have, you know, we have a major incident. Now you're going to jail. I mean it's
[01:49:25] it's a totally different thing. I could have stopped that very easily in the beginning. Yeah.
[01:49:30] Or I can have major issues to deal with in the end. Yeah. Like this, I mean, this is more like the
[01:49:38] slippery slope situation, but not war and nothing like that. But you know how like, I don't know,
[01:49:42] financial guys, right? So there'll be like, hey, I'm going to do in investment. You know, you
[01:49:50] hear about this where they'll be like, okay, I'm going to collect this money from my, my people,
[01:49:54] you know, my clients. And then I'm going to invest it, right? And then I'm just going to grab this
[01:50:01] little bit. I'll pay it right back. Oh, you know, next thing you know, you're going to level seven
[01:50:05] Ponzi. Yeah, this is that and that's the thing that's the slippery slope where when you start,
[01:50:10] even before you like start to slip or whatever, when you start, you think of, okay, where I'm right now.
[01:50:15] And going to prison for the Ponzi. Yeah, you never would. You're like, you know, I'm going to, you know,
[01:50:21] I've seen, I've never read, does that sounds like that would really be this psychology of people
[01:50:28] that do that? Like, I better, well, I don't know because I have a specific example that you read
[01:50:33] about or something. No, no, I'm just kind of assuming that that's what the mindset is. Yeah, well,
[01:50:38] I had read about like the slippery slope situation, but it really, it's like two perspectives. One is
[01:50:43] like when you're in the mix and the the next step or down the slippery slope, the net is always
[01:50:50] a totally understandable. No, I'm just going to run, you know, sound the alarm. I mean, I bet if you
[01:50:55] looked at the Bernie made off where he had said that, you judge. Yeah. I would, I would have to read about it,
[01:51:00] but it would make sense to me that your assumption is correct that. In the beginning, he wasn't like,
[01:51:05] you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to rip off a bunch of people. Right. I bet in the beginning,
[01:51:08] he said, you know what? I got these good investments. I'm going to get these people to buy in.
[01:51:11] And then he goes, you know, and I didn't quite make what we were going to make, but I'm just going to
[01:51:15] go ahead and take some of these other people's money and just distribute it. Yeah. So everyone's kind of happy. Yeah.
[01:51:20] And you know, that's where it starts. Yeah. And then you then you realize you can get away with it and you go on
[01:51:25] down that road. Yeah. And that and that, that's let's ego, by the way, because that's that's just ego,
[01:51:31] because you're like, I don't want to admit to everybody that hey, I didn't make the money. I promised you.
[01:51:35] So you know what I'm going to do? Double down. Double down. Yeah. But the two perspectives is kind of the
[01:51:41] the the thing where when you're in the mix, that one step is like that's hard to see it,
[01:51:48] right, in a matter of speaking, it's hard to see. Because you're like, yeah, why should I, you know,
[01:51:52] this guy came in 30 seconds like so what am I going to do? Repremand them in front of everyone. Come on.
[01:51:59] You know, like really, you know, so no, you know, that's that's easy to understand. But every last
[01:52:05] employee never coming in on time. You're like no way, impossible, no way. When I started this
[01:52:11] come, no way, I would ever let that happen. But here's the thing, it will happen with that,
[01:52:15] you know, because of that, because each little step is hard to see. You can't see it.
[01:52:20] That's why it's like, this is the rule and straight up. So, you know, sticklers of, you know,
[01:52:24] people like when they're sticklers, they're the rules. It's kind of like, I guess made me be like
[01:52:29] socially the norm is like, hey, it's a stickler's of tight-wad, whatever, you know, but I will say this
[01:52:34] value to that. There's also the way to lead like when you heard about Benteen,
[01:52:40] Benteen wouldn't have called the guy out like that, but he would have just given him a look.
[01:52:44] Right, right. Don't you think it's a good idea? Don't you think it's really important that we
[01:52:47] are on time? Yeah, yeah. You know, we're going to call them out in front of everybody,
[01:52:50] right? Yeah. But he still would have been a leader. He's still would have led. And that's, that's
[01:52:54] the, that's what we want to do. Yeah. Yeah. So, I guess we'll, uh,
[01:53:01] yeah, save the questions from the interweb for next time.
[01:53:05] Hey, Native American names are the coolest. They do have the coolest names. Yeah. But if, if,
[01:53:12] if I had another son, I think I'd name him Bloody knife. Yeah. Right. Or what was the other one?
[01:53:17] And the fans, one stab. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Native Americans definitely knew how to put
[01:53:23] their names together. So what you like, what's the formula? It's like, oh, it's some significant
[01:53:29] thing that this guy's in and we'll just call him. Well, you remember, wooden leg, because his name
[01:53:32] was eats from the hand. And then they changed it from eats, I think it was eats from his hand
[01:53:38] or eats from the hand. Once he proved that he was actually a badass warrior, his dad's, because he
[01:53:44] had, he had requested the name from putting the right to the uncle. From a uncle, because they could
[01:53:48] both, they could both walk, they could both walk the distance long and then we could up. And so
[01:53:54] he requested that name. And when he once they found it to be a little big horn, he introduced his son
[01:53:59] as this is my son wouldn't lay. Yeah. Oh my, uh, Sarah before, um, they were like, hey, I wonder how
[01:54:09] the Native Americans get their name. I know how they just, when they do something significant,
[01:54:13] they just, they just give it to them. They don't make up the names or anything. That's their
[01:54:17] name what they do. So her friend Abby, she smoked a lot at the time. So her name was Abby Smokes a lot.
[01:54:24] The, the, the, the, the, the legitimately? No. No, no, that's her Native American name.
[01:54:29] But but in the warrior culture, it's way cooler. You know what I mean? Yeah.
[01:54:34] I like dances with wolves, but I mean, and that's probably not warrior culture.
[01:54:40] Yeah, you see no move. I haven't seen that movie. There's a long time ago,
[01:54:44] there you go. That was when I went still went to movies before I just found them all kind of lame.
[01:54:48] It's so super cute.
[01:54:51] Yeah.
[01:54:52] All right.
[01:54:53] Well, I guess with that, how about you talk about how we can get in the game?
[01:55:05] Getting the game there.
[01:55:06] And little support, the podcast, maybe, would be nice to learn how to force that.
[01:55:11] If you want to support the podcast, you can do it.
[01:55:13] Yeah.
[01:55:14] And this is how.
[01:55:15] Yeah.
[01:55:16] If you don't know already, I would say with supporting this podcast support yourself.
[01:55:26] That's, I think that because if you're incapable, how or, you know, if you're not capable of supporting yourself,
[01:55:31] how can you support podcast?
[01:55:32] That's what can you support us.
[01:55:33] That's right.
[01:55:34] So I'll just do that.
[01:55:35] And yeah.
[01:55:36] By the way, we got mixed reviews from the last podcast.
[01:55:38] I had said something along the lines of, hey, does this take too long?
[01:55:42] Actually, we didn't get mixed reviews.
[01:55:44] I think the only reviews we got were positive.
[01:55:47] Yeah.
[01:55:48] Now there might be some people that just didn't say anything because they were trying to be kind and gentle.
[01:55:51] Yeah.
[01:55:52] So that's fine.
[01:55:53] They press stop right now.
[01:55:54] The rest of the people that are kind of like the little deep in the game.
[01:55:59] They're deep in the game.
[01:56:00] Yeah.
[01:56:01] And that's a good, well, in a way, and there were some good points that they brought up because
[01:56:06] I forget he said it, but they were like, there's some nuggets in there.
[01:56:11] Yeah.
[01:56:12] We don't stop trying to learn.
[01:56:15] Yeah.
[01:56:16] While we're talking about things that help us, right?
[01:56:19] Correct.
[01:56:20] We're still trying to figure some stuff out.
[01:56:21] Yeah.
[01:56:22] There's some nuggets of information there that might be dropped at any time.
[01:56:26] Yeah.
[01:56:27] And even if not, that's part of the reason why I put the guide, you know, on YouTube.
[01:56:34] Oh, yeah.
[01:56:35] Yeah.
[01:56:36] So you know, there's got, yeah.
[01:56:36] This is the guys are talking about this stuff.
[01:56:37] So it's turned it off.
[01:56:38] It looks like, oh, whatever, the internet stuff.
[01:56:41] I'll just skip that part.
[01:56:42] Yeah.
[01:56:43] You can skip it and I'll tell you where to skip to.
[01:56:45] So both options are there.
[01:56:47] Yeah.
[01:56:48] Yeah.
[01:56:49] Because some people might just want to take everything they can from the podcast.
[01:56:52] That's why I put, you know, the timestamp for all the subjects.
[01:56:56] Yeah.
[01:56:57] Because, you know, you look, I like to assume that every 100% of the people, everybody,
[01:57:05] 10 out of 10.
[01:57:09] Like every single word of that.
[01:57:11] And they like every single subject and they like, I like, I like to think that.
[01:57:15] But in the event of that not being in the case, I don't want them to be all this while I got to sit through.
[01:57:20] Echo talking about, you know, Amazon click throughs and on it, you know, so they have the option.
[01:57:25] I think that's important.
[01:57:26] Yeah.
[01:57:27] We're working together.
[01:57:28] I feel like we're all in this together, you know.
[01:57:30] We don't need the one guy being, hey, I have a different opinion than you.
[01:57:33] I have that right.
[01:57:34] And then now I got to sit through the stuff that you guys like.
[01:57:36] Yeah.
[01:57:37] And then I think we're taking care of both sides of it.
[01:57:40] Sure.
[01:57:41] So, and to do that, you know, of course, like I said, you support yourself supplementation.
[01:57:45] If you're into it, and here's the thing where I didn't think that like,
[01:57:49] Krill oil was supplementation.
[01:57:51] Who's the thing it is?
[01:57:52] And it helps.
[01:57:53] Because that's because you're now on the crime on the Krill oil.
[01:57:56] And it's, and I've reaped its benefits.
[01:57:58] And my, my wife's dad was talking about Krill oil from, oh,
[01:58:02] Fish oil, no, not fish oil.
[01:58:04] Fish oil is good.
[01:58:05] Don't get it wrong.
[01:58:06] Just standing.
[01:58:07] Just, you know what's better?
[01:58:08] Krill oil.
[01:58:09] This is what he would sell.
[01:58:10] I'm like, yeah, yeah, he's kind of, you know, one of these health, like guys.
[01:58:16] And, um, the omeas it turns out that he always looks right.
[01:58:19] Yeah.
[01:58:20] So, um, yeah, Krill oil from, from on it, of course, that's the main one.
[01:58:23] They have like the quality, the quality stuff.
[01:58:26] Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, and he, one might think, oh, yeah, of course.
[01:58:32] I'm not going to go get the cheap stuff like what, but here's the thing.
[01:58:35] With supplements, like there is cheap stuff.
[01:58:37] There's like stuff that straight up doesn't work.
[01:58:39] Like you might as well be taking like chalk condensed into pill.
[01:58:43] It's true.
[01:58:44] Absolutely true.
[01:58:45] chalk, you said.
[01:58:46] Yeah.
[01:58:47] Okay.
[01:58:48] Don't do that.
[01:58:48] Because it's not like, I don't know, something about it being a supplement.
[01:58:51] It's not rig, I don't know, something.
[01:58:52] But on it is all legit, like it has the literature, all that stuff like where they get it.
[01:58:56] Even the Krill oil is like, you're so excited about where the Krill oil comes from.
[01:59:01] Always.
[01:59:02] That's the deal.
[01:59:03] Like I said, we're all, because you're about to,
[01:59:04] Yeah, that's it.
[01:59:05] You're about to tell us about the environment.
[01:59:06] Go for any ships.
[01:59:07] Yep.
[01:59:08] That's what you love that.
[01:59:09] That was kind of a cool video too.
[01:59:11] Yeah.
[01:59:12] No, I like that.
[01:59:13] Obviously, we left an impression on you.
[01:59:14] And for you to say something's cool video, that's a pretty good combo.
[01:59:17] That means like, yeah.
[01:59:18] You kind of like cool videos and make them.
[01:59:20] At least we hope that you make them.
[01:59:22] I tell myself, yeah, sure.
[01:59:24] Because a lot of times if we don't make them, you don't make them.
[01:59:26] Don't know if you make one every three months.
[01:59:28] Then how do we feel about that?
[01:59:30] They're all I got to.
[01:59:31] We don't feel really good about it.
[01:59:32] Yeah.
[01:59:33] There you go.
[01:59:34] I mean, okay, you know, I take your point fully.
[01:59:38] But back to the krill oil.
[01:59:40] It's good.
[01:59:41] Anyway, what else?
[01:59:42] The krill oil, worry bars, the true tech for performance.
[01:59:47] You know, if you, if you want the edge, that sounds like kind of commercially, but for real.
[01:59:52] If you want the edge, if you want to get the edge.
[01:59:55] If you want, you can now for brain too.
[01:59:57] Alpha brain gets like a lot of mental edge.
[02:00:00] You know what? And you can get 10% off of getting support. You're all it.
[02:00:03] Which is good too.
[02:00:05] Go to on it.com slash.
[02:00:07] Jacko.
[02:00:09] Also, cool way. Good way.
[02:00:12] Legit way doesn't cost you anything.
[02:00:14] Way to support this podcast.
[02:00:16] Reinforces podcast and be in the game.
[02:00:20] Let's face it.
[02:00:21] Much better to be in the game.
[02:00:23] And here I was this.
[02:00:24] And this is on a side note from this.
[02:00:26] So, you know, like, you know, like, people will go to like,
[02:00:31] a motivational seminar or something.
[02:00:33] You know, like this or or listen to a motivational speech.
[02:00:37] My motivational seminar would be three minutes long.
[02:00:40] Yeah.
[02:00:41] So, there's this, like party brain where, you know,
[02:00:45] it's seek something and then you get to pay off.
[02:00:47] And then it's it's basically a sense of satisfaction.
[02:00:50] So you could seek no more.
[02:00:51] So you're, you're satisfied.
[02:00:53] So people seeking inspiration and motivation.
[02:00:56] They'll go and they'll go to a speech or a seminar or something like this.
[02:01:00] And they'll consume the speech or the motivational video or whatever.
[02:01:06] But they're specating.
[02:01:07] There, yeah, they're watching it.
[02:01:08] There's spectating.
[02:01:09] Yeah, the speech.
[02:01:10] Sure. Yeah. So the whole thing.
[02:01:11] That's a lot different.
[02:01:12] Really the big picture should be.
[02:01:13] I'm going to get see this speech.
[02:01:15] Motivation video.
[02:01:16] Whatever.
[02:01:17] I'm going to be inspired.
[02:01:18] Motivate.
[02:01:18] Now I'm going to go take action.
[02:01:19] Right.
[02:01:20] But to take action, you still have to have a need, you know,
[02:01:23] that needs to be satisfied.
[02:01:24] But people, they'll, they'll view or, or whatever.
[02:01:28] Consumant the speech.
[02:01:31] And they will be satisfied because they see the speech.
[02:01:35] And they don't take action.
[02:01:37] And here's the thing.
[02:01:38] The next speech that comes in the town or the next motivational video on YouTube.
[02:01:42] You know, it is the next one.
[02:01:43] Yeah.
[02:01:43] Or the next time whoever the person is,
[02:01:45] I don't know, Tony Robbins or whoever.
[02:01:47] Next time they're coming to town,
[02:01:49] they're going to go for that good stuff that they got last time.
[02:01:52] They left real satisfied with, you know,
[02:01:54] you see hearing that, you know, viewing that speech.
[02:01:57] They go, they do it again.
[02:01:58] They get that sense satisfaction.
[02:01:59] Still taking no action, by the way.
[02:02:01] Not good.
[02:02:02] So it's like it's a weird.
[02:02:03] It's a messed up cycle.
[02:02:04] Well, I think the big difference there is,
[02:02:05] and that's, is that those,
[02:02:07] literally you're watching.
[02:02:09] Yeah.
[02:02:10] And you're spectating.
[02:02:11] Yeah.
[02:02:11] As opposed to getting in the game.
[02:02:14] Yeah.
[02:02:15] And see.
[02:02:16] That's my, that was really my whole point where
[02:02:18] you know, I'm going to listen to you.
[02:02:21] You're not saying like,
[02:02:23] I mean, you are saying get after,
[02:02:24] but you're not saying you can do it.
[02:02:26] You're not saying that kind of stuff, you know?
[02:02:28] Like, and I know it goes,
[02:02:29] I'm actually, I'm actually not saying you can do it.
[02:02:32] I'm actually saying do it.
[02:02:34] Do it.
[02:02:34] Yeah.
[02:02:34] Exactly right.
[02:02:35] But that's the thing.
[02:02:36] So really the whole message,
[02:02:38] whatever it may be, you know,
[02:02:40] I don't know, big, don't know,
[02:02:41] that's all this stuff is.
[02:02:43] The big messages don't eat donuts.
[02:02:44] I think, I don't know, right?
[02:02:46] I don't know, but there's a bunch of messages.
[02:02:48] But the key there to them,
[02:02:50] the whole message is you got to do it.
[02:02:52] Yeah.
[02:02:52] It's not like you can do it.
[02:02:54] You know, you're like,
[02:02:55] I can do it.
[02:02:56] I feel good about that.
[02:02:57] I'm good.
[02:02:58] But this is like,
[02:02:59] you got to do, you got to go out and do that.
[02:03:01] You know, you can't just watch.
[02:03:03] Okay.
[02:03:04] I think I'm convinced.
[02:03:05] You know, I'm ready to get the game.
[02:03:06] I'm saying that's the difference.
[02:03:08] And so you're saying that Amazon,
[02:03:10] the free DM is on shopping,
[02:03:11] click through the website.
[02:03:13] Jocobacast.com.
[02:03:14] Little Amazon link.
[02:03:15] It definitely helps.
[02:03:16] And also,
[02:03:17] we're all going to be all up on Amazon for Christmas.
[02:03:22] Yeah.
[02:03:23] For the holiday season.
[02:03:24] For whatever it is,
[02:03:25] you're going to celebrate when school's off for two weeks.
[02:03:27] And you got to buy a bunch of people present.
[02:03:29] Yeah.
[02:03:30] During that time period,
[02:03:31] that's a good time to support the podcast.
[02:03:33] Doesn't cost you anything.
[02:03:34] You click through Amazon.
[02:03:35] And you make your purchases.
[02:03:37] The key there is to remember it.
[02:03:39] Like you need some kind of cue.
[02:03:40] Put in your bookmarks.
[02:03:41] I'm going to leave that.
[02:03:42] Some kind of cue.
[02:03:43] That's good.
[02:03:44] That's the key right there.
[02:03:45] I think the rest is just,
[02:03:47] it just kind of takes care of itself.
[02:03:49] Anyway,
[02:03:50] and then you can subscribe,
[02:03:51] of course,

[02:04:35] If you think they're cool,
[02:04:36] look at them.
[02:04:38] There's going to be more to them than meets the eye.
[02:04:41] Just looking at them.
[02:04:42] But if you like how they look,
[02:04:44] maybe look into them.
[02:04:45] But here's the thing,
[02:04:47] no,
[02:04:47] you know,
[02:04:48] making like a so mysterious,
[02:04:49] like,
[02:04:49] oh,
[02:04:49] there's all these layers.
[02:04:50] How I always say,
[02:04:51] yeah.
[02:04:51] Then the hoodie.
[02:04:52] Once I just discipline
[02:04:54] other sizes,
[02:04:55] freedom.
[02:04:56] If you look,
[02:04:56] be pay attention.
[02:04:57] That's a little equal sign.
[02:04:58] Yeah.
[02:04:59] And it's a barcode.
[02:05:00] Yep.
[02:05:01] That's made into equal sign.
[02:05:02] Someone hit me on Twitter,
[02:05:03] said,
[02:05:03] hey,
[02:05:04] you're talking about the layers.
[02:05:05] Is this equal sign a layer?
[02:05:07] Yeah.
[02:05:08] Yeah.
[02:05:08] Like is this a little hidden thing?
[02:05:10] Yeah.
[02:05:11] It's not that big of a deal.
[02:05:12] But it's small deal.
[02:05:13] It's like a double like,
[02:05:15] okay,
[02:05:16] here it is.
[02:05:17] So the font.
[02:05:19] Right.
[02:05:20] Yes.
[02:05:21] Jockel chose the font.
[02:05:22] Yes.
[02:05:23] Before any of this thing started,
[02:05:24] Jockel chose the font.
[02:05:25] Yeah,
[02:05:26] because I made the jockel podcast,
[02:05:29] despite you being a massive,
[02:05:29] you know,
[02:05:30] skills with.
[02:05:31] Yeah.
[02:05:31] Because I made the
[02:05:33] Jockel podcast,
[02:05:34] despite you being a massive,
[02:05:37] you know,
[02:05:38] skills with.
[02:05:39] All those programs that do all the design.
[02:05:42] And you have a great graphics mind and all that stuff.
[02:05:44] Despite all that,
[02:05:45] I just made this little thing.
[02:05:46] You know,
[02:05:47] a little jockel podcast symbol.
[02:05:48] And I made it on PowerPoint.
[02:05:50] And when it came time to pick the font.
[02:05:54] I chose.
[02:05:56] This font called OCR.
[02:05:59] You know,
[02:06:00] optical,
[02:06:01] something recognition.
[02:06:03] Yeah.
[02:06:03] Optical because for in my mind,
[02:06:05] I'm always like,
[02:06:06] okay,
[02:06:06] part machine.
[02:06:07] Right.
[02:06:07] I'm part machine.
[02:06:08] So this font can be read by machines.
[02:06:11] Yep.
[02:06:12] That is why original.
[02:06:13] That is why I use this font.
[02:06:14] Yeah.
[02:06:15] So yeah, and you can look at it.
[02:06:16] I don't know if you told me to look it up,
[02:06:18] but you said it,
[02:06:19] you're like, oh, yeah,
[02:06:20] it's cool.
[02:06:21] Oh, thanks.
[02:06:21] I looked it up.
[02:06:22] And yeah,
[02:06:23] sure enough,
[02:06:23] it's the first font that they made that computers can.
[02:06:26] Yes, that's right.
[02:06:27] That is what it is.
[02:06:28] That's why I chose it.
[02:06:29] Oh, my God.
[02:06:30] It's guys deep.
[02:06:31] Oh, my.
[02:06:32] All right.
[02:06:33] So the barcode.
[02:06:35] Is just something else.
[02:06:37] Another thing like the computer is going to be reading your shirt kind of thing.
[02:06:40] You're a machine.
[02:06:41] Yeah.
[02:06:42] Well, you're wearing them.
[02:06:43] You're a machine readable.
[02:06:44] You're a machine.
[02:06:45] Yes, yes, you're wearing it.
[02:06:46] That's what it is.
[02:06:47] You can't get right back from your.
[02:06:49] So that's kind of the little,
[02:06:50] I mean,
[02:06:50] that's just more like a fun thing for sure.
[02:06:52] Small life.
[02:06:53] But anyway,
[02:06:54] again,
[02:06:55] jockel store that's where all the stuff is.
[02:06:57] Cool rash guards that.
[02:06:59] Hey, man,
[02:07:00] we made the claim 19%.
[02:07:02] Improvement.
[02:07:03] Mm-hmm.
[02:07:04] That is yet to be refuted so far.
[02:07:06] You know,
[02:07:07] as far as feedback that I've been getting.
[02:07:08] Anyway,
[02:07:09] if you want your improvement because you know what,
[02:07:11] you know what, though,
[02:07:12] I think that there is legitimacy.
[02:07:14] I like actually,
[02:07:15] somebody put an article on today about how it compresses the muscle
[02:07:18] increase the circulation.
[02:07:19] So you actually get the legit improvement.
[02:07:21] I don't know all the science behind it.
[02:07:23] You know,
[02:07:23] but
[02:07:24] bro science.
[02:07:25] Yeah.
[02:07:26] No,
[02:07:26] but you know what is,
[02:07:27] you're saying,
[02:07:28] you know,
[02:07:28] when you put on like,
[02:07:30] a uniform.
[02:07:31] Oh, yeah,
[02:07:32] you,
[02:07:32] or you get a little,
[02:07:33] yeah.
[02:07:34] Yeah.
[02:07:35] This is a ritual back to the ritual
[02:07:36] conversation.
[02:07:37] Yeah.
[02:07:38] Yeah.
[02:07:38] Kind of,
[02:07:38] and it's like,
[02:07:39] it's weird.
[02:07:40] Like,
[02:07:40] when I was young when I played footballs 11,
[02:07:42] you're old.
[02:07:43] And we got new shoes.
[02:07:44] Football seasons here.
[02:07:45] New shoes.
[02:07:46] I couldn't wait to go to practice.
[02:07:47] I'm going to be faster.
[02:07:48] Few months.
[02:07:49] Man,
[02:07:50] my shoes are dirty.
[02:07:51] I hate practice,
[02:07:52] but you get new shoes.
[02:07:53] You want to go practice.
[02:07:54] You get new workout gear.
[02:07:55] You're like,
[02:07:56] I'm going to go.

[02:08:03] So that's kind of,
[02:08:04] that's baby effector as well.
[02:08:05] There's a little place above.
[02:08:06] Yeah.
[02:08:07] Yeah.
[02:08:08] Placibo.
[02:08:09] Placibo.
[02:08:10] Placibo.
[02:08:11] Yeah.
[02:08:12] And that's,
[02:08:13] I call it,

[02:08:21] Oh.
[02:08:22] But you know,
[02:08:23] now that you say that,
[02:08:24] they better be actually coming out soon.
[02:08:25] I know.
[02:08:26] I think my clock is counting down.
[02:08:28] My Debbie clock.
[02:08:29] Debbie gave me like a countdown.
[02:08:31] Oh,
[02:08:31] the deadline.
[02:08:33] The straight up deadline.
[02:08:34] You know,
[02:08:34] to give me one month.
[02:08:35] It's leading up the chain of command.
[02:08:37] Yeah.
[02:08:37] Yeah.
[02:08:37] Respect.
[02:08:38] You expect, I know.
[02:08:39] You can also get some.
[02:08:42] Jockel white tea.
[02:08:44] If you want to drink some tea,
[02:08:45] that tastes really good.
[02:08:46] If you haven't tried it yet,
[02:08:47] it doesn't taste like tea.
[02:08:49] And it doesn't taste like anything else.
[02:08:51] It tastes like something really good.
[02:08:53] So,
[02:08:54] so give it a shot.
[02:08:55] And a lot of people have replaced
[02:08:57] every other beverage in their diet.
[02:09:00] With Jockel white tea.
[02:09:02] And on top of that,
[02:09:03] we got a little something new coming out.
[02:09:04] That can be used for tea,
[02:09:06] or for coffee,
[02:09:07] or for milk,
[02:09:09] or for cream,
[02:09:10] and it's a big old mug.
[02:09:12] So those are going to be on Amazon.
[02:09:14] And the mug,
[02:09:15] it's just a big black mug.
[02:09:17] And then written on the mug is.
[02:09:21] It just says,
[02:09:22] get after it.
[02:09:23] So you can,
[02:09:24] you can get one of those.
[02:09:25] It also says approved.
[02:09:27] Yeah.
[02:09:28] It was approved.
[02:09:29] It's approved.
[02:09:30] In fact, by me.
[02:09:31] So you get those mugs.
[02:09:33] And they're pretty cool.
[02:09:35] And then also you get the book
[02:09:37] Extreme Watership,
[02:09:38] which I wrote with my brother,
[02:09:39] Late Babin.
[02:09:40] And,
[02:09:40] pick it up.
[02:09:42] You know what?
[02:09:43] A lot of what I dig is when people buy it
[02:09:45] for themselves.
[02:09:46] And then three days later after they get done reading it,
[02:09:49] they buy four more for the people that are on their team.
[02:09:51] And then they buy one for their boss.
[02:09:53] And then they buy one for the five people that are in their
[02:09:56] peers team.
[02:09:59] And they just spread the word because they want to make their life easier by having people getting after it all around them and taking extreme ownership.
[02:10:05] And if you do want to kind of keep,
[02:10:08] keep cruising with,
[02:10:11] you know,

[02:11:08] Stay ahead of the enemy.
[02:11:11] Keep getting after it.
[02:11:14] And then to all the troopers that I'm meeting all the time.
[02:11:20] Every industry, every industry you can imagine.
[02:11:23] That are out there making things happen.
[02:11:27] Turning and burning day to day.
[02:11:31] Crushing things,
[02:11:33] whether it's so massive project that you are completely devoted to doing,
[02:11:40] and doing it perfectly,
[02:11:42] or you know what,
[02:11:43] there's plenty of people that hit me up and they say,
[02:11:45] hey, you know what I got to do?
[02:11:47] A bunch of stupid administrative tasks today,
[02:11:49] yes, what?
[02:11:50] I'm going to line them up and I'm going to crush them.
[02:11:53] So wherever you are on today on that spectrum,
[02:11:58] line them up and crush them.
[02:12:04] So, until next time,
[02:12:08] this is echo and jockel,
[02:12:11] out.
