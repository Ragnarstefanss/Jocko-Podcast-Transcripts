00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.80
This is jockel podcast number 128 with echo Charles and me jockel willic

2
00:00:06.36 --> 00:00:07.84
Good evening echo good evening

3
00:00:08.40 --> 00:00:12.80
It's been a little bit since we've done Q&A so we're gonna roll into some Q&A and

4
00:00:13.32 --> 00:00:15.32
gonna try and answer

5
00:00:15.88 --> 00:00:26.36
More questions than normal with some shorter answers got a lot of Twitter questions which necessitates shorter questions and thereby in some cases

6
00:00:26.36 --> 00:00:29.56
Short-er answers. I've got to I've got some more

7
00:00:30.12 --> 00:00:34.88
Detail answers or detailed questions stacked up for another Q&A but for today

8
00:00:35.04 --> 00:00:38.000
We're just gonna try and get through some of these

9
00:00:39.88 --> 00:00:41.88
For no guarantee on that but

10
00:00:42.56 --> 00:00:46.04
What's rocking all cool jockel do you believe in overtraining?

11
00:00:46.56 --> 00:00:51.92
Do you believe in overtraining or is that an excuse people use you have the CT

12
00:00:51.92 --> 00:00:59.40
Fletcher's triathletes yourself, it's such a good after daily you also find other elite athletes who believe in rest days

13
00:01:00.08 --> 00:01:01.92
Who are by no means slackers?

14
00:01:01.92 --> 00:01:03.92
What's your take?

15
00:01:03.92 --> 00:01:11.36
You know what can you overtrain? Yes, you can you can definitely overtrain. I will say this most people don't overtrain

16
00:01:12.12 --> 00:01:18.000
Because you got to work pretty hard to overtrain and if you overtrain you'll know it if you're paying attention to your performance

17
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.68
Because your performance will start to go down that that's what's happening and I've said this before

18
00:01:21.68 --> 00:01:28.20
I've seen it with fighters that were preparing for a fight and they'd be overtraining and you'd watch their performance

19
00:01:28.72 --> 00:01:30.24
Someone that's normally

20
00:01:30.24 --> 00:01:34.20
Crushing let's say the fighter is normally crushing training partner A and

21
00:01:34.56 --> 00:01:39.76
All of a sudden training a partner A starts getting the better of the fighter and you know you know

22
00:01:39.76 --> 00:01:44.32
It's obvious the guys overtrained so take a couple days off get some steak and

23
00:01:45.96 --> 00:01:47.96
Get get back get

24
00:01:47.96 --> 00:01:51.08
Reset because you're overtrained. So yeah, you can overtrain for sure

25
00:01:51.60 --> 00:01:57.88
Now what I don't believe in well, it's hard to overtrain. I mean these guys are working hard when they're overtraining

26
00:01:58.44 --> 00:02:00.04
but a

27
00:02:00.04 --> 00:02:03.56
A lot of people just they do you can use overtraining as an excuse

28
00:02:03.88 --> 00:02:10.64
What I do is I'm gonna do something every day. I try and do something every day regardless like even if

29
00:02:11.24 --> 00:02:13.32
Even if I feel like I'm gonna like last night

30
00:02:13.32 --> 00:02:20.44
I got kind of beat up on the map. So I know I'm pretty I'm pretty overtrained right now, but I'm also getting ready to go on a trip

31
00:02:20.44 --> 00:02:23.24
So I'm like okay, well, I'm just gonna still school I squatted today

32
00:02:23.24 --> 00:02:26.92
And I'm still gonna train hard tonight and then I got a couple days where I'll be on the road

33
00:02:26.92 --> 00:02:30.28
I might take one of those days and just like do more of a stretch

34
00:02:31.48 --> 00:02:32.68
Mobility

35
00:02:32.68 --> 00:02:36.24
Sineario workouts still to get the blood flow because I got to get the blood flow

36
00:02:36.24 --> 00:02:39.56
But you know, maybe just like a hundred burpees and then a bunch of stretching

37
00:02:39.56 --> 00:02:45.16
So I'll do a little recovery on the road, but yes, you can overtrain. It's hard to do it

38
00:02:45.48 --> 00:02:47.48
If your performance is going down you're overtraining

39
00:02:48.36 --> 00:02:51.40
Eat some steak take a break take a break eat some steak

40
00:02:52.92 --> 00:02:54.92
Well, hundred burpees kind of a lot

41
00:02:56.60 --> 00:03:01.80
I think a hundred burpees. Yeah, I think there's less than 10 minutes put it this way

42
00:03:02.36 --> 00:03:07.000
I did oh then again all the times I did a hundred burpees with after one yeah, so that feels a little different

43
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Yeah, it's just go to a hundred burpees

44
00:03:10.20 --> 00:03:16.76
hundred burpees yeah, that well the kokey so overtraining though is like there's two or maybe even more different kinds of

45
00:03:16.76 --> 00:03:21.24
Clothes on quote overtraining so there's like this like a for real like I don't know for

46
00:03:22.12 --> 00:03:24.12
I'm gonna miss you to a clinical

47
00:03:25.40 --> 00:03:28.52
Version of overtraining which is like official like your blood

48
00:03:28.92 --> 00:03:33.48
You can recognize it in your blood and there's certain things and sure whatever and there's all the spots

49
00:03:33.48 --> 00:03:38.44
There it not as positive to think it's actual thing like you don't sleep and it's like your body

50
00:03:38.84 --> 00:03:43.16
Essentially goes into this like negative kind of feedback or positive feedback loop where it's like

51
00:03:43.64 --> 00:03:50.36
Just your overtraining and it takes like a while to get out of it like a while you gotta go through this process and then

52
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.18
There's also like a condition like raddo so yeah, that's a serious

53
00:03:56.68 --> 00:04:00.40
Yeah, that's essentially overtraining. Yes, that's a cute

54
00:04:00.40 --> 00:04:09.44
You know we're training quickly. Yeah, to usually to get hit with the rabbi and then there's like this kind of gray area and you can get rabdo it

55
00:04:09.44 --> 00:04:13.20
I guess you can get I think I think I think get rabdo and like certain muscle groups

56
00:04:13.92 --> 00:04:19.04
But anyways rabdo. Yeah, that'll take you out. I remember cake nuts. We're rolling cake nuts

57
00:04:19.04 --> 00:04:23.08
He's a kind guy who's like just kind of down for anything not this kind of like

58
00:04:23.76 --> 00:04:29.10
Fire plug type guy because he's super mellow, but he's just down for anything like the kind where if you're gonna go do something kind of weird

59
00:04:29.10 --> 00:04:35.10
He'll or whatever he'll always kind of sort of just be there, you know, he always kind of says yes

60
00:04:35.10 --> 00:04:37.10
So anyway we're training and

61
00:04:37.42 --> 00:04:42.72
He you know when someone asks you to roll and you're done you're like all not done maybe next time. Yeah, not cake nuts

62
00:04:42.72 --> 00:04:44.32
No, he was like okay

63
00:04:44.32 --> 00:04:48.30
Does and you could tell you's like tired is like okay, and then we're all done or adding and then you know

64
00:04:48.30 --> 00:04:53.74
Certain guys come in later whatever maybe one two guys and another guy asked them to roll and we're like dang cake

65
00:04:53.74 --> 00:05:00.22
Still rolling and I think he even rolled before us too and he was just rolling well he might have did some other PT or whatever

66
00:05:00.22 --> 00:05:02.22
He is like man

67
00:05:02.70 --> 00:05:08.02
He's like man I'm pretty tired right now and then another guy asks a well, it's rolling is like okay

68
00:05:08.02 --> 00:05:10.42
And we're just laughing like it's kind of like a white belt

69
00:05:10.90 --> 00:05:14.26
Yeah, which means all these which means all these rolls are not like

70
00:05:14.98 --> 00:05:19.50
Relax scenarios they're actual level nine death battles. Yeah, he's going for yeah. He's a perfect

71
00:05:19.50 --> 00:05:25.50
Don't know by the way. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, but yeah, to time I think he was a white belt and yeah, so he goes in

72
00:05:25.50 --> 00:05:27.94
He's like man, I'm tired messed up and I was like yeah, man

73
00:05:27.94 --> 00:05:29.94
I dig it you rolled a lot and

74
00:05:29.94 --> 00:05:37.34
And come to find out he had wrapped it. Yeah, but anyway, go and then there's a great area over training where you're training a lot

75
00:05:37.34 --> 00:05:40.46
Maybe your test hospital will be down from training a lot and

76
00:05:41.02 --> 00:05:44.18
Me, you know your nutrition may or may not be all that kind of thing

77
00:05:44.18 --> 00:05:47.70
So your performance does go down. You feel a little bit more tired going into training

78
00:05:47.70 --> 00:05:50.94
You know, if you're lifting or whatever you can't lift this heavy and all this stuff

79
00:05:50.94 --> 00:05:56.30
That's like a great you're not overtrained though. You just how you say just you just take in a day two days later

80
00:05:56.30 --> 00:05:58.54
Boom, you're kind of back in the game. You know kind of thing

81
00:05:58.54 --> 00:06:05.06
But I'll think that's a clinical technically overtrained maybe you're not recovering day to day as much or something like this

82
00:06:05.06 --> 00:06:10.62
But cool in the last but all treat things all real things hey your body's this machine man

83
00:06:10.62 --> 00:06:16.98
If you know with all these different systems of the systems ain't work all in working right you may not get you know the performance that you

84
00:06:17.98 --> 00:06:19.98
Do what next question

85
00:06:21.66 --> 00:06:26.82
What would you pack for lunch if you had a typical nine to five job?

86
00:06:27.54 --> 00:06:35.38
Yeah, chicken steak beef jerky not's I don't know a salad. No, no big shocker there. Yeah, right?

87
00:06:35.38 --> 00:06:38.74
Just don't need to don't listen to the office next question no tuna sandwich

88
00:06:38.74 --> 00:06:41.70
No tuna sandwich

89
00:06:41.70 --> 00:06:51.22
All we thread tomato lettuce sprouts that's your go-tongue. No. That's what my mom would probably pack for me if she was

90
00:06:51.86 --> 00:06:56.02
Packing my lunch, but people are nothing what your mom would that feel for lunch when you were young

91
00:06:56.02 --> 00:06:57.54
That wasn't a question

92
00:06:57.54 --> 00:07:00.70
It kind of sounds my mom would have been a meal when I was young

93
00:07:01.38 --> 00:07:02.74
B and J

94
00:07:02.74 --> 00:07:06.70
All right. Yeah, there it is. That's good bag of potato chips. Oh, yes

95
00:07:06.70 --> 00:07:13.42
Well, that was pv and j good, but but potatoes if they're not I just man. He is the same it tastes good

96
00:07:13.42 --> 00:07:17.42
Actually, but peanut butter is good and of course what I would do is take the potatoes from the bottom on the

97
00:07:17.94 --> 00:07:19.02
Like a psycho

98
00:07:19.02 --> 00:07:21.78
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

99
00:07:21.78 --> 00:07:23.54
So there you go guys know what to eat come on

100
00:07:24.46 --> 00:07:31.74
Work well here. I'm sure they're asking me because that is kind of a thing like you have a nine to five job right and especially if the kind of the culture is like

101
00:07:31.74 --> 00:07:35.98
Okay, I got to work and then boom we got well. Gonna lunch me and my boys from work

102
00:07:35.98 --> 00:07:40.46
We're gonna lunch maybe a bar maybe you know kind of thing, but they want to break the cycle

103
00:07:40.46 --> 00:07:43.26
So it's like you know, it's not it's kind of common knowledge

104
00:07:43.26 --> 00:07:47.90
Okay, break this like will bring your own lunch you yeah, well definitely bring it much not only you will you eat better

105
00:07:47.90 --> 00:07:49.34
But you also won't spend

106
00:07:49.74 --> 00:07:51.42
$19 for lunch

107
00:07:51.42 --> 00:07:55.18
Yeah, you'll spend you'll spend like $6 for lunch and it'll be better for you

108
00:07:55.18 --> 00:07:58.38
So that's just yeah, yeah, okay, so maybe I should have made that more clear

109
00:07:58.62 --> 00:08:00.22
Don't go out to the little

110
00:08:00.22 --> 00:08:06.70
Reconer store and whatever the corner restaurant and spend $28 for crappy food that's gonna make you fat and lazy

111
00:08:07.02 --> 00:08:11.58
Yeah, just pack your own food that costs $6 that's gonna make you lean strong and smarter

112
00:08:11.74 --> 00:08:18.54
Yeah, but and then there and comes this question I think I don't know but I think so because let's say you've never done that before

113
00:08:20.06 --> 00:08:21.34
Yeah, so I'm crazy

114
00:08:21.34 --> 00:08:23.02
There's a thing

115
00:08:23.02 --> 00:08:25.42
So so great change right you always eat stuff and

116
00:08:25.42 --> 00:08:31.50
And I don't think he ever like cooks at home or whatever right and me and kind of well

117
00:08:31.50 --> 00:08:36.06
I'd kind of do both whatever, but I cook it home. I go make I have my go to little things right at home

118
00:08:36.06 --> 00:08:39.18
So we're talking about that was explained to him oh, yeah

119
00:08:40.70 --> 00:08:42.62
Oh, yeah, I'll just do this when I'm on the program

120
00:08:42.62 --> 00:08:47.26
I'll do this so I'll make this and he's like dang you you actually do that and I like cook and make stuff

121
00:08:47.26 --> 00:08:52.22
It's all surprised. Yeah, like it was like this foreign thing for it. Okay. I'll give you a go to right now

122
00:08:52.22 --> 00:08:55.10
You want to talk to you's you said tuna I have

123
00:08:56.30 --> 00:09:00.06
Tin chicken like I don't even know my wife calls it tin chicken

124
00:09:00.30 --> 00:09:05.82
It comes in can yeah, because I don't really like fish sure and so I have chicken in a can

125
00:09:06.62 --> 00:09:12.14
Open it up put some mayonnaise in there you're you're good food. Yeah, yeah, I do that and you can get big big

126
00:09:12.94 --> 00:09:17.98
Big cans of chicken. Oh, yeah, that's a good total go to yeah, yeah, that's a good one

127
00:09:17.98 --> 00:09:24.30
Lot of sodium a lot of times in those ones. You know if you care about those kinds of things, but yeah, there's a lot of chicken in there too

128
00:09:25.50 --> 00:09:32.30
You know you can do with that too if you have just a little bit more time the chicken the one in the can't sweet is good because it's so fast

129
00:09:32.70 --> 00:09:36.54
boom boom boom one speed but if you you can like

130
00:09:37.74 --> 00:09:40.30
Kind of halfway boil some chicken chop it up

131
00:09:40.30 --> 00:09:46.78
What it saute it right with some stuff right and then chop it up even more boom at the mayonnaise is kind of the same deal

132
00:09:47.50 --> 00:09:52.54
And you can do it that way you don't need like they can chicken some people do not prefer can chicken though

133
00:09:52.54 --> 00:09:56.94
That's cool. That's the thing. I can do other things. Yeah, yeah, yeah, then that's the other thing. I'm talking about

134
00:09:57.58 --> 00:10:02.62
Anyway, so well, you know, if you're not made chicken, yeah, I you know, no, it's good

135
00:10:02.62 --> 00:10:04.62
It's like a whole thing

136
00:10:04.62 --> 00:10:07.66
You know, I'll Greg it was foreign to Greg to actually cook at home

137
00:10:07.66 --> 00:10:13.58
It's foreign for people to actually make a lunch like man. Where do I start with this thing? What do I do and then?

138
00:10:14.22 --> 00:10:16.46
Usually in fact from what I understand anyway

139
00:10:17.02 --> 00:10:20.86
Usually it's kind of like oh all all kind of sort of by a lunch

140
00:10:21.66 --> 00:10:26.38
While I'm not at work, you know, maybe good as to buy one of these box lunches or something and then bring it in

141
00:10:26.46 --> 00:10:32.22
Is that a man it's defeating the periets at thing, but it's a defeating the purpose you make the lunch like I said

142
00:10:32.22 --> 00:10:33.50
I want to see like that

143
00:10:33.50 --> 00:10:35.50
I'm telling you cool. It works

144
00:10:35.50 --> 00:10:38.70
That's the direction you want to go. That's my opinion

145
00:10:39.90 --> 00:10:41.10
Next question

146
00:10:41.10 --> 00:10:45.50
You've mentioned being involved in real estate. Are you still involved? How do you get started?

147
00:10:46.46 --> 00:10:49.34
Whether flipping or renting flipping mean buying

148
00:10:51.02 --> 00:10:56.30
Fixing up selling houses or renting or whatever. Did you start with a lot of money or no?

149
00:10:57.50 --> 00:11:02.30
Is it something you are or were very hands on with or contract work out?

150
00:11:02.30 --> 00:11:05.66
I've been real lucky with the whole real estate thing

151
00:11:06.06 --> 00:11:10.30
Part of it's because I was in the military and while the crash happened

152
00:11:11.18 --> 00:11:14.94
I didn't even barely knew there was an economic crash going on

153
00:11:15.98 --> 00:11:21.82
And so with so we're talking 2007 2008 time frame when the the market crashed and

154
00:11:22.62 --> 00:11:24.62
I was in the military so I just was

155
00:11:25.34 --> 00:11:28.62
Captain doing what I was doing and bought some houses then and

156
00:11:28.62 --> 00:11:32.62
I would say yeah, and then I've continued to do that so

157
00:11:33.02 --> 00:11:39.90
It's a good it's a good investment long-term short-term you can get screwed if you think you're gonna buy something right now

158
00:11:39.90 --> 00:11:42.70
Like for instance flipping a house that's cool. You can make a lot of money

159
00:11:42.70 --> 00:11:48.22
But also you could buy right now buy a house for $200,000 and think you're gonna fix it up and sell it for $300,000

160
00:11:48.70 --> 00:11:53.58
And then you buy it and the market crashes and now your house that you bought for $200,000 only worth $150

161
00:11:53.82 --> 00:11:55.82
So now you're you're out of luck

162
00:11:55.82 --> 00:11:59.50
So you the way I look at it, you know just as as a

163
00:12:00.22 --> 00:12:05.98
Normal person yeah, just trying by a house. That's number one. By trying by house to live in and then

164
00:12:06.78 --> 00:12:12.70
Trying paid off as fast as you can and then when you get it to a good point and you fix it up and you think you can rent it out

165
00:12:12.70 --> 00:12:16.06
That's cool. Do it rented out and buy another one and keep doing that

166
00:12:16.86 --> 00:12:20.54
one and I you know, I'm the real estate expert. I'm not

167
00:12:21.02 --> 00:12:23.02
running around but

168
00:12:23.02 --> 00:12:25.02
You know to explain you'm not gonna put out a

169
00:12:25.90 --> 00:12:29.34
I'm not gonna put out a seven or I'm probably listening

170
00:12:30.62 --> 00:12:36.86
Hey, if you're gonna buy a buy a house this is what this is something a little bit of advice if you're gonna buy a house by a house in the place

171
00:12:36.94 --> 00:12:41.74
Where you want to live? Where you want to live in it by the worst crappiest house

172
00:12:42.86 --> 00:12:47.74
But where you want it because the location you cannot change once you buy it you're stuck in that location

173
00:12:48.46 --> 00:12:52.30
And so it's so you can but you can always rebuild it and fix it up and make it nice

174
00:12:52.30 --> 00:12:55.50
So by a house I made that mistake one time I bought a house

175
00:12:55.90 --> 00:12:59.90
I bought a bigger house in a place where I didn't really like it

176
00:12:59.90 --> 00:13:04.06
But I thought oh the house is so nice and big and about it was like two weeks after I bought it

177
00:13:04.06 --> 00:13:07.18
This is actually the first house I ever bought two weeks after I bought it

178
00:13:07.18 --> 00:13:10.78
I was saying man, I should have bought the other house I was looking at that was in the location

179
00:13:10.78 --> 00:13:16.14
I wanted that was a little bit smaller not as nice so anyways buy it where you want it and then

180
00:13:16.78 --> 00:13:19.58
Fixed up as you go along as far as the work doing the work

181
00:13:19.58 --> 00:13:24.54
All the work that I did on my houses I did myself and

182
00:13:26.94 --> 00:13:29.58
Now I don't do too much anymore because I don't have time but when I was in the Navy

183
00:13:29.58 --> 00:13:31.58
Well, you either have time where you have money, right?

184
00:13:32.38 --> 00:13:37.18
So when I was in the Navy I had more time if you can believe that when I was in the Navy and I had no money

185
00:13:37.90 --> 00:13:43.26
So like at all my houses when I bought him I couldn't afford them like a barely afford him

186
00:13:43.98 --> 00:13:47.42
So you gotta be that's now not advising that because

187
00:13:47.42 --> 00:13:53.66
If you you gotta be able to suck it up if things go sideways you're gonna be living on

188
00:13:54.86 --> 00:13:57.18
No money living leave gonna be lean Christmas

189
00:13:57.42 --> 00:14:01.02
That's my parents used to say to me and that's what I said to my kids is gonna be a lean Christmas

190
00:14:01.82 --> 00:14:06.62
So you gotta be ready for the link where some people aren't ready for a lean Christmas. Yes, some people cannot live

191
00:14:07.74 --> 00:14:09.18
Some people cannot

192
00:14:09.18 --> 00:14:16.62
Control their expenses if things go bad and and you know when I bought all my just about every house I bought when I got into my house

193
00:14:16.62 --> 00:14:22.38
It was like okay, we made it now we're gonna starve for two years or whatever

194
00:14:22.54 --> 00:14:26.94
Trying to get everything squared away again. So anyways you gotta be smart

195
00:14:27.50 --> 00:14:32.06
But it definitely makes more sense to buy I shouldn't say this because there's some people that argue get that

196
00:14:33.26 --> 00:14:40.86
I think if you're gonna live somewhere for a while by a house instead of paying someone else's mortgage pay your own and trying paid down as Kirk's you can that's it

197
00:14:40.86 --> 00:14:46.46
Yeah, it's my advice cool agree I guess I don't know

198
00:14:47.18 --> 00:14:54.38
Unless of an experiment yeah like like here's an idea when you join the military a save up all your money don't spend it on booze

199
00:14:55.50 --> 00:15:00.46
Which you're going to you're gonna want to yeah because everyone's gonna be going out don't do that by it

200
00:15:00.46 --> 00:15:05.90
By whatever you can buy by a little condo by something and then rent out the rooms that are in it

201
00:15:05.90 --> 00:15:12.14
And you sleep on the couch and you rent out the rooms in your paying the mortgage as soon as you get that thing kind of stable boom

202
00:15:12.22 --> 00:15:16.50
Go and buy another one yeah, and that's that's how you you can start doing it

203
00:15:16.58 --> 00:15:20.38
You said that it was easier for you in the milk because you're in the military

204
00:15:20.38 --> 00:15:22.70
Why was it my paycheck was coming no matter what?

205
00:15:22.70 --> 00:15:28.46
Oh, it wasn't like I was gonna get laid off. I mean so many people got laid off during the during the economic downturn

206
00:15:28.46 --> 00:15:33.90
Right, they couldn't buy they couldn't afford their mortgage payments anymore and that that was made the bad situation even worse

207
00:15:33.90 --> 00:15:37.66
Yeah, so for me it was like I was just sitting there collecting my paycheck as normal

208
00:15:38.22 --> 00:15:44.46
Didn't even really realize that the market was getting destroyed and all fronts because I was in the military

209
00:15:44.46 --> 00:15:47.18
Yeah, and I wasn't sitting around staring at the

210
00:15:47.74 --> 00:15:50.46
At the stock market every day trying to figure out where it was gonna go and

211
00:15:52.22 --> 00:15:56.94
Do you get I mean you do right you get like benefits or you'd loans easier whatever?

212
00:15:56.94 --> 00:16:01.58
Yeah, they're so proud of the a loan yeah, which which is a good loan

213
00:16:01.58 --> 00:16:07.90
It's a good loan and you can only get one though, so I mean I use that you can reset it and you use none other houses

214
00:16:07.90 --> 00:16:11.50
But which I've done a couple times, but that's a cool like little jumping off point

215
00:16:11.50 --> 00:16:15.50
It's a really good jumping off jumping off jumping off point. Yeah, it's a really good jumping off point for sure

216
00:16:15.90 --> 00:16:18.94
But the thing to be careful of is

217
00:16:19.50 --> 00:16:23.18
speculating and thinking that the prices of houses is always gonna go up

218
00:16:23.18 --> 00:16:28.46
Which is what everyone fought in 2016 2007 2008 hey don't worry the prices are just gonna keep going up

219
00:16:28.46 --> 00:16:33.10
They're not they're gonna come down sometimes yeah, and so you can't bank on that

220
00:16:33.66 --> 00:16:35.82
You can't bank on that what you bank on is like okay

221
00:16:35.82 --> 00:16:41.02
I like this house. It's in a good location. I'm gonna live here for a long time if I get stuck in it for a long time

222
00:16:41.02 --> 00:16:44.02
I don't mad my mind. I won't be mad and

223
00:16:45.26 --> 00:16:47.26
I can suffer

224
00:16:48.14 --> 00:16:54.46
Okay, I can make my family suffer. Okay, like you know when you can't take your your family out for dinner

225
00:16:54.46 --> 00:16:58.22
For months on end like oh no sorry. We're not going out for dinner

226
00:16:59.26 --> 00:17:01.26
No, we're not doing that. We're not buying that

227
00:17:01.90 --> 00:17:06.22
Buying your kids used stuff for Christmas which I did when I was in military

228
00:17:06.38 --> 00:17:08.70
Okay, you know I'd love to get you something new, but guess what?

229
00:17:09.18 --> 00:17:11.18
Sometimes Santa Claus brings some

230
00:17:11.58 --> 00:17:13.42
Recycling the recycled goods

231
00:17:13.42 --> 00:17:20.38
Some other kids didn't want it. That's fine. If you if you don't have that in you to suck it up and and live lean

232
00:17:20.38 --> 00:17:26.06
Then you don't then you need to make different decisions. Yeah because because a lot of time

233
00:17:26.06 --> 00:17:31.10
I know it was like this in like oh seven six maybe where

234
00:17:32.46 --> 00:17:37.34
Guys like I remember seeing people they like a lot of people were just becoming loan officers

235
00:17:37.34 --> 00:17:41.34
Oh, yeah for sure like flipping houses, you know kind of thing and it's kind of all

236
00:17:41.34 --> 00:17:45.02
They look at it as like this get rich quick kind of thing and then they're like yeah

237
00:17:45.02 --> 00:17:46.78
Let me just do it see you know experience

238
00:17:46.78 --> 00:17:53.10
That's there all this stuff and then they'll do it all uneducated all like with none of what you just said none of that and well

239
00:17:53.10 --> 00:17:55.10
I got a buddy that

240
00:17:55.10 --> 00:17:59.10
He he was telling me the story because he was in the seal teams and during that

241
00:17:59.90 --> 00:18:01.90
Market boom during the housing market boom

242
00:18:02.46 --> 00:18:07.26
He bought like five houses yeah and he he's so fun to hear because he's a humble guy

243
00:18:07.50 --> 00:18:11.26
And he's telling tell me the story is 10 years ago. He's telling me the story but he's like

244
00:18:11.82 --> 00:18:14.78
He's like yeah when I was doing this

245
00:18:14.78 --> 00:18:18.38
I thought everyone else was so stupid

246
00:18:18.38 --> 00:18:22.54
I thought I was just the smartest guy in the world because what he was doing was getting these loans that

247
00:18:22.70 --> 00:18:27.90
He couldn't afford but at that time the the mortgage people were given loans to anybody

248
00:18:27.90 --> 00:18:33.82
Yeah, and he did it and he did it over and over and so he ended up with five houses and he said he remembered asking you another

249
00:18:33.98 --> 00:18:35.98
Real estate guy like hey, what if

250
00:18:36.14 --> 00:18:42.54
What if the housing prices go down and then you know the guys like that's not gonna happen and if it does

251
00:18:42.54 --> 00:18:47.58
Even if it did happen you'd have six months to a year to offload all your properties and it'd be

252
00:18:47.98 --> 00:18:49.98
It's no problem

253
00:18:49.98 --> 00:18:51.98
Within a month of that

254
00:18:51.98 --> 00:18:54.70
The market turned and he said 30 days later

255
00:18:55.10 --> 00:19:00.22
Everyone of his properties was upside down meaning he owed more than they were worth in 30 days

256
00:19:01.26 --> 00:19:05.82
And he ended up foreclosing on all those houses except for one he was lucky enough to keep the one that he lived in

257
00:19:06.22 --> 00:19:10.30
Anyway, so yeah, don't you know be measured. It's balanced don't just get crazy

258
00:19:10.30 --> 00:19:15.02
Yeah, yeah, it's not like this get rich like the risks I would take

259
00:19:16.30 --> 00:19:19.66
Was the risk of okay if things don't go well?

260
00:19:19.82 --> 00:19:26.70
It's gonna be a lean Christmas and I'm okay with that if you're not okay with a lean Christmas and a lean and not going out for dinner

261
00:19:26.78 --> 00:19:30.94
And buying your kids use presents for Christmas if you're not okay with that, but you know

262
00:19:30.94 --> 00:19:34.70
What do you want for your birthday? Oh you want to you want something for your birthday cool?

263
00:19:34.70 --> 00:19:39.74
We I'll get you something that resembles that but it might not be the act if you're not okay with that

264
00:19:40.70 --> 00:19:45.66
Then then don't do it. I never would gamble the fact that okay if this goes wrong

265
00:19:45.66 --> 00:19:49.42
We won't have anywhere to live that's a different that's a different level gamble

266
00:19:49.42 --> 00:19:53.50
I didn't gamble that I didn't gamble like okay if I if the market goes sideways

267
00:19:53.90 --> 00:19:58.14
I'm not gonna have a place to live. I didn't gamble that if the market goes sideways

268
00:19:58.70 --> 00:20:03.58
Hey, it's gonna be a lean Christmas and even you like by your own admission you said I

269
00:20:03.58 --> 00:20:09.18
You know, I do it where I live lean kind of thing like you don't have to do it that way like you can be

270
00:20:09.90 --> 00:20:14.06
Way more yeah, you know, you could get yourself for yourself. Yeah, but no risk no reward

271
00:20:16.14 --> 00:20:19.10
But don't risk everything be smart be calculated

272
00:20:19.18 --> 00:20:24.70
So yeah, buy something buy something when you're young hang on to it. Run it out buy something else hang on to it

273
00:20:24.70 --> 00:20:27.90
Run it out. That's a good plan. It's a good long-term plan

274
00:20:27.90 --> 00:20:36.70
Gotcha, juck a long-term plan long-term because the market goes up and down. Yeah, this is probably good advice most of the time

275
00:20:36.70 --> 00:20:40.54
Anyway long-term. Yeah, thank long-term. Thank long-term. Yeah, yeah

276
00:20:43.02 --> 00:20:49.34
Down time do you ever watch mindless to ask do you this question before do you ever watch mindless TV or

277
00:20:49.34 --> 00:20:54.94
YouTube videos to decompress at the end of the day or is that laziness justifying waste of time?

278
00:20:54.94 --> 00:21:01.98
You know quite frankly I don't have a lot of free time to do that even if I was all fired up to watch mindless video on YouTube

279
00:21:03.02 --> 00:21:05.02
So I guess

280
00:21:06.22 --> 00:21:09.50
I guess not really if I'm gonna decompress

281
00:21:10.70 --> 00:21:12.70
Sometimes

282
00:21:13.42 --> 00:21:16.62
I mean sometimes my kids want to watch something and I'll sit there and watch

283
00:21:16.62 --> 00:21:19.90
I'll see what I can go watch an episode of the office

284
00:21:19.90 --> 00:21:21.90
This

285
00:21:22.46 --> 00:21:24.86
It's gonna get kind of mindless kind of funny

286
00:21:25.42 --> 00:21:31.34
Yeah, yeah, that's a that makes sense same same deal. I think probably you know of course

287
00:21:31.34 --> 00:21:33.34
I'll watch my whole life. Oh, that's a good one

288
00:21:34.30 --> 00:21:37.18
Kind of mindless thing. I can tell you this. I've watched zero

289
00:21:37.74 --> 00:21:40.46
If they put it on screen right out I wouldn't even know what it was

290
00:21:41.10 --> 00:21:44.78
Lafon we went we were in the hotel gym the other day. Lafes like check it out

291
00:21:44.78 --> 00:21:49.82
Yeah, you point the TV. I'm like what is that that's a why if I bought you know what you're talking about? Yeah, yeah

292
00:21:49.82 --> 00:21:54.30
I took a picture of it. Yeah, he took a picture of it. He said he felt your presence. Yeah, it's good

293
00:21:54.94 --> 00:21:57.10
That would've fired me up best work out in the world right there

294
00:21:58.14 --> 00:21:59.90
Wi-Fi vote. We're in God. Oh check

295
00:22:02.54 --> 00:22:05.26
Next question. I'm a high school football coach

296
00:22:06.38 --> 00:22:10.46
When you were in charge of training at what point did you use mass punishment?

297
00:22:10.46 --> 00:22:14.30
Yeah, mass punishment. That's basically when the team's not working together

298
00:22:14.86 --> 00:22:19.58
Right when the team's not working together and that can take all kinds of forms, right?

299
00:22:20.06 --> 00:22:23.50
But if they're if they're not working together they're gonna get punished together if they're blaming each other they're gonna

300
00:22:23.50 --> 00:22:26.14
You're gonna get punished together if they're not supporting each other they're gonna get punished together

301
00:22:27.26 --> 00:22:32.78
one thing that I think with a gray area is is if you have an individual

302
00:22:33.34 --> 00:22:38.30
That's making mistakes having problems not performing correctly and then the team

303
00:22:38.30 --> 00:22:42.94
Who's responsibility is it to get that person up to speed? It's the team's responsibility

304
00:22:43.26 --> 00:22:46.94
So if that person continue has a problem. It's like hey if the team doesn't take care of that problem

305
00:22:47.18 --> 00:22:50.78
Then the team has to have to pay yeah, yeah make sense man

306
00:22:52.46 --> 00:22:55.74
Next question instilling and maintaining discipline in

307
00:22:56.62 --> 00:23:00.78
Subjective career fields such as becoming a musician artists, etc

308
00:23:01.42 --> 00:23:07.58
How do you face the obstacles thrown at you when you're subjected to people's opinions to make a living and not the

309
00:23:07.58 --> 00:23:12.30
Standard do your job type of lifestyles

310
00:23:14.94 --> 00:23:21.42
This this this question I'm not sure if I have an answer that people are gonna want to hear on this one

311
00:23:22.70 --> 00:23:24.70
I think first of all I

312
00:23:25.50 --> 00:23:30.30
Originally thought like okay, this is about discipline and you need discipline to get good at craft because that's for sure

313
00:23:30.30 --> 00:23:31.82
Right if you want to get good at

314
00:23:31.82 --> 00:23:38.30
Music or art or whatever you got to you got to have the discipline practice, but that's not really what the question's about

315
00:23:39.10 --> 00:23:40.62
the questions about how do you

316
00:23:41.34 --> 00:23:43.34
Survive and

317
00:23:44.70 --> 00:23:50.46
How do you deal with it when people are might not like what you make and from my perspective?

318
00:23:50.46 --> 00:23:59.58
I think you should do things like art and music because you really love doing them and not to make money and I think

319
00:23:59.58 --> 00:24:01.58
I

320
00:24:01.58 --> 00:24:04.86
Think if you do those things truthfully from the heart

321
00:24:06.70 --> 00:24:11.66
Then it will strike a chord with other people in many many cases because human beings have

322
00:24:12.30 --> 00:24:20.62
Whatever human nature is all kind of the same and so if you do something then people will like it and then you will end up with people that like your work

323
00:24:21.50 --> 00:24:26.70
If you're doing art or music or whatever to make money if that's your goal

324
00:24:26.70 --> 00:24:28.70
Well

325
00:24:28.70 --> 00:24:37.42
Then it's going to be subjective and that's going to be problematic because people might not like what you're doing and so then what you do you change it a little bit then you change it a little bit and you change a little bit

326
00:24:38.62 --> 00:24:42.94
So I don't know to me it's like I would rather have another job that makes me money

327
00:24:44.62 --> 00:24:46.62
So I can get by so that I can do what I want

328
00:24:46.94 --> 00:24:49.26
Artistically if that makes sense

329
00:24:49.26 --> 00:24:51.66
I actually had a guy the other day that was like

330
00:24:52.78 --> 00:24:54.06
saying

331
00:24:54.06 --> 00:24:56.06
You get up early

332
00:24:56.06 --> 00:24:58.78
But different people that are artistic

333
00:24:59.34 --> 00:25:01.10
They have to have a different path

334
00:25:01.82 --> 00:25:05.42
Because they you know if someone's going to kind of make music or they're going to

335
00:25:05.90 --> 00:25:10.62
They're going to draw or paint or they're going to write they need to have freedom

336
00:25:11.58 --> 00:25:17.82
I was like well, I'm kind of written some books and then and I play music in a band

337
00:25:18.54 --> 00:25:22.62
We make rock and roll you know what I mean? Yes, I didn't get all crazy with the guy

338
00:25:22.62 --> 00:25:25.74
Of course you do like no I'm in order to I

339
00:25:26.54 --> 00:25:31.02
Just like a man, you know if you want to you do what you want, man, yeah, but here to help you out

340
00:25:31.26 --> 00:25:35.90
But that's kind of like like doing the podcast like the podcast isn't like oh well

341
00:25:36.46 --> 00:25:39.66
We need to do this so that we can get more people listened so that we can get more money

342
00:25:39.66 --> 00:25:43.66
It's no actually if you don't want to listen this don't listen and we don't wear beholden the no one

343
00:25:44.22 --> 00:25:47.58
No advertisers are going to pull their advertising from us because we don't have any

344
00:25:48.70 --> 00:25:49.90
You

345
00:25:49.90 --> 00:25:57.42
Yes, so we can do what we want yeah and not be worried about one other people think and I think when you do that

346
00:25:57.42 --> 00:25:59.42
Here's the here's the

347
00:26:00.38 --> 00:26:07.58
The where the thread ties back in I think if you're doing what you want and you're creating what you want from the heart truthfully

348
00:26:08.14 --> 00:26:17.02
When it gets out there people people get into it next question. How can I introduce my female boss to the extreme ownership way without being offensive

349
00:26:17.02 --> 00:26:23.50
Just sell it as improvement given the sense before give the book to her and tell her

350
00:26:24.38 --> 00:26:32.38
That you read this book and you really like it and you want to become a better leader and if she could read it and keep you and check

351
00:26:33.34 --> 00:26:36.94
If she sees you get not aligned she you to appreciate it and just let her read it

352
00:26:37.50 --> 00:26:42.06
Yeah, then let the book work is funny you guys are talking about this is the master. I think late

353
00:26:42.06 --> 00:26:45.82
Maybe you said it maybe they said I don't know but you're like I'll tell you how you don't do it

354
00:26:45.82 --> 00:26:50.46
Yeah, throw the book out of it and say you need to square yourself away read this book and of course

355
00:26:52.46 --> 00:26:54.46
Not good no

356
00:26:56.30 --> 00:26:57.50
Next question

357
00:26:57.50 --> 00:27:00.14
Do you experience loneliness while at the top

358
00:27:01.26 --> 00:27:03.90
It's lonely at the top ever that expression yeah, yeah, yeah

359
00:27:03.90 --> 00:27:09.58
It's lonely at the top if so how did you handle it you know actually not really and I guess for me from my perspective

360
00:27:09.58 --> 00:27:13.82
I look at the top being when I was in leadership position while I was a student commander or a task

361
00:27:13.82 --> 00:27:19.18
Into commander or the commander of the the training detachment was it lonely at the top not really man

362
00:27:19.18 --> 00:27:24.78
I had friends and people that are hung out with and people that I would trust to talk and have conversations with

363
00:27:25.34 --> 00:27:27.90
And so that wasn't really affected then on top of that

364
00:27:28.30 --> 00:27:30.94
I actually don't really mind being

365
00:27:31.58 --> 00:27:34.78
All-one it's not a big deal to me. I don't feel lonely when I'm by myself

366
00:27:35.34 --> 00:27:38.22
I'm fine. Yeah, somebody asked me the other day

367
00:27:38.94 --> 00:27:43.02
Are you an introvert or an extrovert and I was like mom probably both and you're like no

368
00:27:43.02 --> 00:27:48.30
Nobody you have to be one of course because right right they said so the task over there and I said

369
00:27:48.86 --> 00:27:54.54
I said well I don't care I literally don't care well like it's what if I'm gonna room with a bunch of people

370
00:27:54.78 --> 00:27:58.46
Okay, if I'm gonna room with by myself don't care whatever bring it

371
00:27:59.26 --> 00:28:06.54
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think the extrovert if I'm not mistaken like look like has a need you know

372
00:28:06.54 --> 00:28:10.62
Like he's there they're like attracted to you know other people being there

373
00:28:10.62 --> 00:28:14.46
Yeah, so I guess that's what I said. I'm like yeah, that's fine. Whatever don't care

374
00:28:15.26 --> 00:28:17.26
alone so yeah

375
00:28:18.46 --> 00:28:20.46
You know and I always like I said I had friends that

376
00:28:21.26 --> 00:28:23.26
I trusted and weren't weren't like

377
00:28:24.22 --> 00:28:25.82
were good enough

378
00:28:25.82 --> 00:28:28.62
friends that they weren't gonna be trying to

379
00:28:31.02 --> 00:28:38.86
Get their own gain out of being my friend, you know people that were friends with me before I was in a leadership position and people that remain friends after so

380
00:28:38.86 --> 00:28:45.34
Yeah, it's not not that big of a deal to me. You know luck. I guess I'm lucky because I mean it must be a thing if everyone says it

381
00:28:45.34 --> 00:28:49.82
Yeah, and I guess maybe in like I'll tell you what you do you do you work?

382
00:28:50.54 --> 00:28:55.90
I'll tell you this this is you when you when you're when you're at the top when you're at an owner or you're the leader

383
00:28:56.30 --> 00:28:58.30
There's times where you have to do things by yourself

384
00:28:58.70 --> 00:29:04.22
Yeah, there's no doubt about that and if you have a problem with that you you're gonna have a problem being a leadership position

385
00:29:04.22 --> 00:29:09.34
Because there's things that you have to do is leader you have to lead from the front you have to work harder you have to do extra

386
00:29:09.82 --> 00:29:13.34
You you should be working harder than everyone else when you're in a leadership position of an organization

387
00:29:13.98 --> 00:29:15.58
No doubt about it and if you're not

388
00:29:16.30 --> 00:29:21.10
Working harder that's not good and if you're if you're working harder

389
00:29:21.66 --> 00:29:26.86
There's gonna be times when you're not with anyone else and you have to be okay with that and I'm perfectly okay with that don't care

390
00:29:27.02 --> 00:29:31.90
Yeah, and that's actually what when that's what that expression means it's only at the top meaning like

391
00:29:31.90 --> 00:29:39.42
You're at the top because you're willing to in a general way of putting it behave or be a certain way that other people either

392
00:29:39.42 --> 00:29:43.18
Okay, yeah, yeah, right so you're not gonna be able to relate from that perspective

393
00:29:43.18 --> 00:29:48.14
You're definitely only at the top. There's no one that's gonna sit there and do what I'm willing to do

394
00:29:48.30 --> 00:29:49.58
Yeah, yeah, to be there

395
00:29:50.38 --> 00:29:54.86
Like where are you at? I don't know haven't seen you, but I'm gonna prove myself and I'm gonna keep getting after it

396
00:29:54.86 --> 00:29:58.06
Right, that's kind of the way yeah, that's how people end up in those positions

397
00:29:58.06 --> 00:30:02.46
Yeah, you don't end up in those positions. You don't get gifted positions. You don't just get end up

398
00:30:02.46 --> 00:30:05.18
I got just shouldn't say never, but I didn't

399
00:30:05.18 --> 00:30:06.22
Yeah, sure

400
00:30:06.22 --> 00:30:08.22
Yeah, had to grind it out

401
00:30:08.22 --> 00:30:10.22
Keep grinding it out. I

402
00:30:10.22 --> 00:30:15.18
Think yeah, you know what I think about this question. I think this what you said doesn't surprise me at all because as

403
00:30:16.38 --> 00:30:18.54
A human being I think we all kind of

404
00:30:20.06 --> 00:30:25.90
Maybe sometimes we do sometimes we don't admit that it is good and nice to have like someone there

405
00:30:25.90 --> 00:30:29.58
Kind of supporting you in this way where

406
00:30:30.70 --> 00:30:35.82
Where you kind of feel like oh your feelings matter kind of thing yeah, it sounds super soft

407
00:30:35.82 --> 00:30:39.42
But it's like kind of deep down inside where like let's say you know how like you know look

408
00:30:39.42 --> 00:30:41.42
No listen

409
00:30:41.42 --> 00:30:44.86
So you know the idea that like people just don't understand

410
00:30:45.42 --> 00:30:48.62
You know that concept okay people just don't get it. They understand or whatever

411
00:30:48.86 --> 00:30:54.22
So when you go to the top that feeling is everyone everywhere the people just don't understand

412
00:30:54.22 --> 00:30:59.18
This is the difference. I don't look at it people in the negative light because they don't get it. I'm fine with it

413
00:30:59.18 --> 00:31:02.14
Yeah, like I recognize that what I'm

414
00:31:03.42 --> 00:31:09.02
I recognize that I'm not 100% normal yeah, and I'm not yeah, it's not like I don't look down

415
00:31:09.66 --> 00:31:12.22
Right, I actually I said this when I just get interviewed

416
00:31:13.26 --> 00:31:17.10
Oh, I got interviewed on a business insider by and and

417
00:31:18.70 --> 00:31:23.58
He's like well do you always keep your discipline? I was like no people get all the seal teams and they get fat and they don't care anymore

418
00:31:23.58 --> 00:31:29.26
And it's like I don't I don't care about that. I'm stoked. You know that means they're stoked and eating breakfast and bed and they're hanging out with their kids

419
00:31:29.26 --> 00:31:31.74
It's all good. I don't I don't have a negative opinion of them

420
00:31:31.74 --> 00:31:38.38
Just like I don't have a negative opinion of someone that prioritizes things differently than me. It's fine. Yeah, it's perfectly fine. Yeah

421
00:31:38.38 --> 00:31:43.50
I get it that that's my point and I'm okay with that and I'm not looking around going

422
00:31:43.50 --> 00:31:48.22
Wow, we should have more people to hang out with it's only up here. That's exactly what lonely other top is though

423
00:31:48.22 --> 00:31:51.42
Yeah, and there's a there was when I was in my first seal putton

424
00:31:51.42 --> 00:31:53.42
I went to Gwom

425
00:31:53.42 --> 00:31:58.62
We got there there was a guy and I don't even know who did it. I don't know where this I don't know who this was

426
00:31:58.62 --> 00:32:02.22
But there was a seal that left like a a surf ski you know what that is

427
00:32:03.02 --> 00:32:05.42
No, it's basically like a kayak that you sit on top of

428
00:32:05.98 --> 00:32:10.62
Anyways, and there's just a little a little a little note to himself. It's at the higher the fewer

429
00:32:11.34 --> 00:32:14.62
Yeah, meaning like hey when you because he was training hard for what I don't know who he was

430
00:32:14.62 --> 00:32:19.42
It's at the higher the fewer so that's the same thing. Yeah, I'm gonna shoot with it. Yeah

431
00:32:19.42 --> 00:32:23.98
Okay, make sense. Yeah, man, so like you know when you're in the office working

432
00:32:23.98 --> 00:32:31.18
You know that's what I tell kids too because that's a whole bullying thing is people kids kids get the feeling that being alone is bad

433
00:32:31.50 --> 00:32:35.66
Like being alone is not a bad thing you should be comfortable being alone. Yeah

434
00:32:37.18 --> 00:32:40.78
Yeah, and as a normal human being it's key I think

435
00:32:41.42 --> 00:32:46.94
For the most part okay being alone is one thing but being alone with no choices another so like if you

436
00:32:46.94 --> 00:32:51.02
You know you're at the office because you just grind all day you're at the top

437
00:32:51.02 --> 00:32:55.02
Slowly at the top whatever you're in the office you're working everyone else is out at

438
00:32:55.58 --> 00:32:59.90
You know Thanksgiving whatever but you're working because you got to work you're at the top

439
00:32:59.90 --> 00:33:06.30
You're still the man but you're working you know kind of thing some people not you some people will be like man, you know

440
00:33:07.34 --> 00:33:12.30
Like I'm in this top position, but I give up like all these you definitely give up things you know

441
00:33:12.30 --> 00:33:19.10
And yeah exactly right but again you say you're okay with it. I get it of course. Yeah, but if it gets to a point where I'm not okay with it

442
00:33:19.10 --> 00:33:23.34
Then I adjust the balance there you go. Okay. That's how you deal with yeah

443
00:33:24.38 --> 00:33:29.18
But you're gonna be playing the long term name. Yeah, not the short term gratification

444
00:33:31.90 --> 00:33:33.90
Check, what's wish

445
00:33:35.18 --> 00:33:40.94
Would you ever consider being in the reboot of the office all you mentioned though

446
00:33:40.94 --> 00:33:42.94
That's why I've been to the go

447
00:33:43.18 --> 00:33:46.78
I had read the questions earlier, but it's always it kind of in my head layers

448
00:33:47.98 --> 00:33:50.94
Do you like Dwight Shrewt the best? Shrewt the best?

449
00:33:52.22 --> 00:33:58.14
Shrewt? That Dwight Shrewt what's wrong with you? Shrewt? Shrewt farms. Yeah, uh the office is a great show

450
00:33:58.78 --> 00:34:03.26
And my kids are obsessed with the office for some reason so I watched the office sometimes with them

451
00:34:03.26 --> 00:34:10.46
There's a British version of the office and I actually prefer the British version of the office

452
00:34:12.06 --> 00:34:16.06
I guess because it's just my personality, but the British version of the office is kind of depressing

453
00:34:16.78 --> 00:34:18.46
Funny, but it's kind of depressing because

454
00:34:19.34 --> 00:34:21.02
The American one goes over the top

455
00:34:21.82 --> 00:34:24.38
The characters are over the top. They're an extreme

456
00:34:25.02 --> 00:34:26.38
So they're funny

457
00:34:26.38 --> 00:34:34.30
You go oh that's funny for for the boss to have that attitude. It's a caricature the British one is

458
00:34:35.02 --> 00:34:37.02
Tone back just enough

459
00:34:37.02 --> 00:34:39.02
That it's more realistic and

460
00:34:39.74 --> 00:34:41.74
It's it's a little bit depressing

461
00:34:42.14 --> 00:34:48.46
That's what my kid. I told my kids got to watch the British one the British one is much better and my kids watching like I don't want to watch that

462
00:34:48.46 --> 00:34:49.74
It's depressing

463
00:34:49.74 --> 00:34:53.58
So yeah, that's great and Dwight Shrewt is an awesome character

464
00:34:53.58 --> 00:34:58.70
Yes because it kind of because everyone knows a Dwight Shrewt who's Dwight Shrewt?

465
00:34:58.70 --> 00:35:01.26
He's a character in the office which one though. I mean I've

466
00:35:02.14 --> 00:35:07.98
Seen it and stuff, but I don't know the names of the guys. He's a guy with glasses. Okay, like this self defense and

467
00:35:08.46 --> 00:35:10.46
Yeah, I was a bit of a darky

468
00:35:12.46 --> 00:35:17.98
So you would be in it. They're like reboot of the office. Hey, Jockel. We want you to be

469
00:35:17.98 --> 00:35:24.94
What I don't do I true or whoever I could be yeah, what's the name guys name Michael right the character in me?

470
00:35:24.94 --> 00:35:29.74
Yeah, the boss yeah, yeah, Mike actually what's funny is when you watch that show you can see leadership issues

471
00:35:30.86 --> 00:35:33.50
Yeah, you know you see the glaring leadership issues

472
00:35:33.66 --> 00:35:37.18
To give little good little less and slern for leadership in there. Yeah sure

473
00:35:37.90 --> 00:35:42.54
So who do you be who's your choice? Hey, Jockel. Oh, I'd have to be one of the people that are in there

474
00:35:42.54 --> 00:35:48.86
Yeah, yeah, this is well reboot actually don't be cool. It'd be a super hard core version of Dwight Shrewt like a legit

475
00:35:48.86 --> 00:35:55.10
Super hard core version of Dwight Shrewt that'd be pretty funny. Well, isn't the whole kind like comic genius behind the character of Dwight Shrewt

476
00:35:55.10 --> 00:36:01.74
Is that he's so dorky like a Napoleon dynamite type guy right like he's like so dorky, but you like yeah

477
00:36:02.46 --> 00:36:09.26
This bar chord right true, so you could be super hardcore, but it'd be inverse you'd be you'd be just dorky like your daughter

478
00:36:09.26 --> 00:36:15.42
You know, Dwight Shrewt is trying to sell the his hard cornness, but he's just dorky take any character to the extreme and can be funny

479
00:36:15.50 --> 00:36:19.34
Yeah, so in your case actually if you if you like when I'm on Twitter

480
00:36:19.58 --> 00:36:25.90
I take my character sure, you know with someone says what's what's a good dessert steak

481
00:36:26.62 --> 00:36:28.62
Just having fun. Yeah, right?

482
00:36:28.62 --> 00:36:30.62
You're like the two techs message to by the way

483
00:36:31.98 --> 00:36:35.42
So yeah, so your character is hardcore underlying hardcore

484
00:36:35.42 --> 00:36:40.94
That's like the known thing when but then you're trying to be all I don't know like smart or something like you know like

485
00:36:40.94 --> 00:36:44.06
Like this is for the the reable boot

486
00:36:45.26 --> 00:36:48.94
I'm not worried about it. No, man. That's how it is. Look at the classic

487
00:36:50.70 --> 00:36:51.66
All right

488
00:36:51.66 --> 00:36:57.82
Next question has seen kids in hell holes ever made parenting harder for you

489
00:36:59.02 --> 00:37:01.02
Leave it or not leave it kids

490
00:37:01.02 --> 00:37:07.98
Not really when I when I was overseas and you teach kids in horrible situations it just makes you

491
00:37:07.98 --> 00:37:10.86
Appreciate the opportunity that you have to provide for

492
00:37:12.06 --> 00:37:18.62
Your kids and to try and help those kids as much as you can so I don't think it made parenting harder for me

493
00:37:20.54 --> 00:37:28.70
Yeah, just make you appreciative. Yeah, with the opportunities that we have for sure. Yeah, I feel like I know that question where

494
00:37:28.70 --> 00:37:34.86
Yeah, I want it if I see like kids and animals it it doesn't make it harder, but it makes it like

495
00:37:36.30 --> 00:37:41.74
You're more sensitive, you know like you just stop just affects you more with your kids. I don't know in my

496
00:37:42.30 --> 00:37:48.78
Experiences what happened because you kind of can't you know like it messes you up when you see like like my wife will

497
00:37:49.66 --> 00:37:55.58
Read like uh trafficking like human trafficking art because he's stuff and you see but when it be pictures or video

498
00:37:55.58 --> 00:38:01.10
Whatever and so it kind of leaves them mark in your brain. So I don't know maybe you're just playing every day kind of stuff

499
00:38:01.10 --> 00:38:06.14
And you see your kid and you're like dang you can't help but remember those pictures and dual comparison

500
00:38:06.14 --> 00:38:09.02
Oh yeah, well, that's what that'll make you paranoid too in a good way

501
00:38:09.02 --> 00:38:13.18
Yeah, yeah, yeah, be careful with your kids. There's evil people out there. Yeah

502
00:38:15.98 --> 00:38:22.06
Next question how do you reduce your bosses anxiety levels do a really good job?

503
00:38:22.06 --> 00:38:28.38
You know what I mean stay out of the power curve do a really good job keep them informed and kick ass

504
00:38:28.38 --> 00:38:32.54
And that's how you relieve your bosses anxiety step up. Yeah

505
00:38:36.22 --> 00:38:39.18
That's that's good advice for your wife, too, by the way

506
00:38:40.54 --> 00:38:46.86
Relieving your wife's anxiety levels. Yeah, for sure. Take lead, right? Not lead like oh, you know call all the shots in this

507
00:38:46.86 --> 00:38:52.70
early but you know if if if you guys are trying to figure out where to go for dinner boom

508
00:38:53.66 --> 00:38:57.50
Call it call it man. Don't be like oh whatever you want don't do that

509
00:38:58.22 --> 00:39:01.02
Don't create the leadership void. Don't do that

510
00:39:02.14 --> 00:39:04.14
Check I learned that for you by the way

511
00:39:04.78 --> 00:39:08.06
Next question trying to keep in shape while traveling long-term

512
00:39:08.86 --> 00:39:14.06
And not use not having gym access as an excuse for letting my standard slip best pieces of

513
00:39:14.06 --> 00:39:21.26
Kit training styles from maintaining conditioning and adding mass while living out of the back

514
00:39:21.26 --> 00:39:28.22
Did get rings yeah get rings get gymnastics. What gymnastic rings? Why would because plastic or metal will make

515
00:39:28.78 --> 00:39:32.62
You get sweaty and slip and you have to bring a ton of chalk you need a little bit of chalk with wood rings

516
00:39:32.62 --> 00:39:36.78
It's a little bit of a reserve and there's the best thing to grab on to so yeah get wood gymnastics rings

517
00:39:36.78 --> 00:39:40.94
You can carry them anywhere and then just do a bunch of counts that next time come on, man

518
00:39:40.94 --> 00:39:46.30
Just I don't know what adding mass how how do you add mass can it's like oh you got to get creative

519
00:39:46.30 --> 00:39:53.02
Yeah, you got to get creative but it's you know instead of doing squats, you know air squats

520
00:39:53.10 --> 00:39:57.74
Do jump squats or you're doing some dynamic. You know what do they learn metrics? Yeah, I do one like epistols

521
00:39:58.06 --> 00:40:02.78
Yeah, all that stuff. Yeah, yeah, that's the I got to do that right now like I can't

522
00:40:03.58 --> 00:40:05.58
You can drill the hole in like

523
00:40:05.58 --> 00:40:11.10
This is called the owner, so they drill the hole and they attach the 10 and not in the hole

524
00:40:11.10 --> 00:40:15.66
They go to push the 10 and through the hole. They put an anchor at the end of it boom

525
00:40:16.86 --> 00:40:23.02
Anyway a lot of swelling in the forearm you can't grab nothing you can't grab anything and have weight

526
00:40:23.58 --> 00:40:24.38
You know

527
00:40:24.38 --> 00:40:29.58
So calistening because you got to kind of make your position you're wrists in a position in like a comfortable position

528
00:40:29.58 --> 00:40:31.18
And you can do calistening

529
00:40:31.18 --> 00:40:37.02
Anyway point there is I'm in that boat or lifting weights is not an option at this very moment for me

530
00:40:37.42 --> 00:40:41.58
So you got to kind of get creative so like a push up

531
00:40:42.46 --> 00:40:46.46
You can make the pushups harder if you put your feet up and the higher you put your feet

532
00:40:46.54 --> 00:40:52.70
You know the harder it becomes or you do like a one-on push-up situation and then you can do like a declant like um

533
00:40:52.70 --> 00:40:55.10
You know you go on a counter first, right?

534
00:40:55.10 --> 00:41:00.38
Okay, how many of these one-on pushups? You can do more than 20. Okay, maybe you go for like a chair or something like this

535
00:41:00.38 --> 00:41:02.38
Something something a shorter

536
00:41:03.10 --> 00:41:06.22
Boom you can do more than 20 of those. Okay now I can go to the ground

537
00:41:06.78 --> 00:41:11.18
Seems like and then you can go raise your feet up as it's time goes on boom. There you go

538
00:41:11.58 --> 00:41:16.30
Good for and actually body weight through space is the best way to build size

539
00:41:17.42 --> 00:41:19.42
In your muscles there

540
00:41:19.42 --> 00:41:28.22
As far as like exercise is go good information. It is better than dead lifting and squatting well okay, so that dead lifting squatting that's gonna be

541
00:41:28.22 --> 00:41:30.22
The

542
00:41:30.22 --> 00:41:36.22
It's gonna depend on the weight, but think about this dead lifting and squatting is moving your body through space

543
00:41:37.10 --> 00:41:38.46
So

544
00:41:38.46 --> 00:41:43.26
Doing air squat you're moving your body through space is as opposed to max squatting with weight

545
00:41:43.82 --> 00:41:47.18
So I'm back squat right right right right but one squat yeah

546
00:41:48.06 --> 00:41:52.54
Good you can hear me with squat yeah, but again like as a

547
00:41:52.54 --> 00:41:58.86
Moving your body through space is the or the best exercises for

548
00:41:59.18 --> 00:42:03.26
What is what is not moving your body through? Like okay squat compared to a leg press

549
00:42:03.58 --> 00:42:08.06
So if you go again, why even those aren't even in my those aren't even in my mind

550
00:42:08.06 --> 00:42:11.10
I know bro, but this guy asking the question. Okay, it might be

551
00:42:11.74 --> 00:42:17.50
Well, I'm trying to help him out. I don't want to help you. You got the whole exercise thing figured out. I get it you know your

552
00:42:17.74 --> 00:42:19.10
expert in your

553
00:42:19.10 --> 00:42:21.10
boring workouts

554
00:42:21.10 --> 00:42:23.10
Talk about that later nonetheless

555
00:42:23.10 --> 00:42:30.14
So body weights or body moving your body through space is the best exercise the problem is or tends to be

556
00:42:30.62 --> 00:42:33.26
That your body has a fixed amount of weight more or less

557
00:42:33.82 --> 00:42:39.10
So you can adjust the weight and usually you can move your body through space a bunch of times if you do air squat

558
00:42:39.10 --> 00:42:44.78
You can do a bunch of air squats so it doesn't provide the quote unquote tension that you need to build mass

559
00:42:45.18 --> 00:42:47.18
That's what you go one at a time

560
00:42:47.18 --> 00:42:53.18
Create more tension on your muscle while still moving your body through space which could wind up to be a better exercise for you

561
00:42:53.90 --> 00:42:57.02
That's what I'm saying that's good. Okay, man whatever

562
00:42:57.02 --> 00:43:01.10
Bride don't act like it's crazy that I'm saying this stuff that's the question you really the question

563
00:43:01.10 --> 00:43:04.70
You're going to love with this whole moving your body through space thing yeah

564
00:43:04.70 --> 00:43:11.74
That's a good information. Really. I just have no idea what that I I kind of get it now. Yeah, but you were saying it as if it was

565
00:43:13.66 --> 00:43:15.26
some

566
00:43:15.26 --> 00:43:20.30
Unknown it is unknown moving your body through space. Okay, so you know what a hammer strength

567
00:43:20.30 --> 00:43:25.34
Yes, okay, so it's all you know, it's like a it's like a I don't know like a lever kind of thing

568
00:43:25.34 --> 00:43:30.14
Yeah, yeah, you know you put some plates on it you push it. There's no pull here nothing, but you know

569
00:43:30.14 --> 00:43:32.94
You're moving your body through space. You know moving your body through space. You know, I'm moving your body through space

570
00:43:32.94 --> 00:43:37.74
So I'm kind of creating the spectrum here so could just consider that then it's kind of far down

571
00:43:37.74 --> 00:43:42.22
There's other movement or things that are further down this spectrum, but that's fixed movement

572
00:43:42.22 --> 00:43:47.82
There's no balance required. There's no whatever. It's just like you're just pushing late. It's isolation

573
00:43:47.82 --> 00:43:52.70
I suddenly did yeah playing the plane is isolated all this to the plane movement. Cool, right?

574
00:43:52.70 --> 00:43:58.94
So that will have less neural muscular activity when you push it even if you're pushing heavy weights

575
00:43:59.18 --> 00:44:00.94
Then something like

576
00:44:00.94 --> 00:44:03.98
Graduate to like a barbell bench press right for example

577
00:44:04.86 --> 00:44:09.10
But even that even though you do have to balance so that's a big step up

578
00:44:09.10 --> 00:44:15.98
But even that you don't have to balance in certain planes certain planes of movement you don't have to balance like the what you call this with lateral

579
00:44:16.30 --> 00:44:20.30
whatever the lateral movement and a barbell bench press which is the bar

580
00:44:21.10 --> 00:44:28.14
You don't have to balance it's fixed but front and back or forwarding forwarding back whatever you do have to balance so you know still good

581
00:44:29.82 --> 00:44:34.06
Now go to dumbbells now you have 360 degree plane of

582
00:44:34.06 --> 00:44:40.86
Movement that you have to balance more neural muscular activity so dumbbells are better than barbells in that way

583
00:44:40.86 --> 00:44:45.58
Neurmuscular activity and you can adjust the weight so you can do things where you can only do three reps

584
00:44:45.58 --> 00:44:49.02
You can do things you can do 20 reps if you want so boom great exercise

585
00:44:50.14 --> 00:44:53.66
Carefully do it on hotel room, but just saying general so you can good exercise

586
00:44:53.82 --> 00:44:56.38
But now you go the tip top the best

587
00:44:57.10 --> 00:45:00.70
Exercise for normal muscular activity would be pushups

588
00:45:00.70 --> 00:45:05.90
Because same thing you're moving your body through space you're not balancing weight balance

589
00:45:05.90 --> 00:45:13.02
You're going to bring all the ball get even better now you're going like creative which is good. That's like beyond the spectrum which is good totally good

590
00:45:14.14 --> 00:45:17.90
But so yeah keep these things in my I think when you when you do a thing

591
00:45:17.90 --> 00:45:23.58
What so if you can add or when to work out so when you if you can add weight that's the challenge if you can add weight

592
00:45:24.30 --> 00:45:28.62
To these moving your body through space exercises that's when you can get well

593
00:45:28.62 --> 00:45:36.22
I think now I'm just going to take this one step further do it because you don't necessarily have to add weight as you stayed in earlier

594
00:45:36.78 --> 00:45:42.78
You can adjust how you're moving your body through space and then you can get the

595
00:45:43.02 --> 00:45:47.58
You can get additional and I'll tell you what really makes this obvious is if you do any gymnastics training

596
00:45:48.30 --> 00:45:54.54
If you do a pull-up that's hard if you do a talk pull-up where your knees are pulled up

597
00:45:54.94 --> 00:45:57.18
That's even harder if you do a

598
00:45:57.18 --> 00:46:02.62
L sit pull-up where your knees are up but your feet are pointed straight forward

599
00:46:02.94 --> 00:46:09.10
That's even harder each one of those things is a little bit harder the same thing with a dip like just a regular dip

600
00:46:09.10 --> 00:46:12.30
Like if you've got your feet hang it's easier if you bring it up to a talk

601
00:46:12.70 --> 00:46:16.54
Isn't a little harder if you bring it up to an L it's even harder

602
00:46:17.10 --> 00:46:24.30
So you can keep doing these things and there's squats that you can do. I mean just doing pistols alone that's a lot harder

603
00:46:24.30 --> 00:46:29.98
Some people can't even do pistols yeah and so you might have to do an assisted pistol to start off

604
00:46:30.30 --> 00:46:34.38
So yeah, you can make it happen pistols got a hard man, especially if you've never done it before

605
00:46:34.38 --> 00:46:36.14
This is hard because the ballets

606
00:46:36.14 --> 00:46:38.62
Yeah, there's a balance back and side-to-side balance

607
00:46:38.62 --> 00:46:44.54
Hard to reach 160 degree plane of balancing that's what this whole thing's about moving your body through space

608
00:46:44.54 --> 00:46:46.54
Is that what it is?

609
00:46:46.54 --> 00:46:50.78
If you place that's where do you read that old school buggerian

610
00:46:50.78 --> 00:46:59.18
Philophilasyphi workout program called this is the old school never deviated from it much the core

611
00:46:59.58 --> 00:47:01.18
Really good to it by the way

612
00:47:01.18 --> 00:47:03.18
Oh, it's called

613
00:47:03.90 --> 00:47:07.98
serious growth is what it's called weird right like that's such a lame name

614
00:47:08.38 --> 00:47:13.74
But man I was in high school and I was like, all right, you know you read all these things right and you know the butt back of the

615
00:47:14.46 --> 00:47:18.94
You know muscle magazine whatever in the little article. I remember all the bullgarion

616
00:47:18.94 --> 00:47:20.94
Yes, kind of like

617
00:47:21.02 --> 00:47:23.02
That was a big thing

618
00:47:23.02 --> 00:47:28.62
No ballgaring well, yeah, because the ballgarrants are doing really good at weightlifting. Yeah, I'm quite no one knew it was weird

619
00:47:29.10 --> 00:47:32.94
And these guys were like yeah five weeks or four weeks my bench went up to this

620
00:47:32.94 --> 00:47:34.94
You know when you're in high school band check it

621
00:47:34.94 --> 00:47:41.10
I'll get that out of it. So you get the program says book and it's just called serious growth and it explains everything really in detail

622
00:47:41.10 --> 00:47:44.82
I'll say dang this is pretty good real plain English to not all those rules

623
00:47:44.82 --> 00:47:46.82
So whatever and

624
00:47:46.82 --> 00:47:51.46
Maybe there's a and they were doing keto too by the way. That's where I learned about keto

625
00:47:51.46 --> 00:47:52.66
90

626
00:47:52.66 --> 00:47:54.90
That's crazy. Yeah, it's been around for a long time

627
00:47:54.90 --> 00:47:56.98
Well the hackens book came out in the

628
00:47:57.30 --> 00:48:01.78
60s or 70s. Yeah, that's way different though. It's not it's not way different. Yeah, yeah

629
00:48:01.78 --> 00:48:05.86
It's different. It's not way different. Yeah. This way this guy. That's been around for a long time

630
00:48:05.86 --> 00:48:10.18
Yeah, Mark Dr. Mario or Maro de Pasquale. Oh, yeah

631
00:48:10.18 --> 00:48:15.14
That's who was the keto guy and again back in the phone. He's still around

632
00:48:15.14 --> 00:48:21.70
Yeah, okay, so yeah, so we did this thing we get this book and it's like laying it out and you know

633
00:48:21.70 --> 00:48:25.14
I'm down 15 16 years old. I'm down to lift

634
00:48:25.14 --> 00:48:31.46
I have days a week. Let's do this and bro. We did it and you eat good not like crazy

635
00:48:31.46 --> 00:48:33.46
I didn't do the keto never did

636
00:48:33.46 --> 00:48:38.58
But you know they have it as an option and so we did it whatever and we it was weird since

637
00:48:38.58 --> 00:48:45.38
But I gained like 20 pounds and I just we just kept doing it so you know you play football. You can't really gain that also

638
00:48:45.38 --> 00:48:49.38
This whole thing that you're 15 and your body's just filled with testosterone

639
00:48:49.38 --> 00:48:52.58
You're getting you you were gonna gain 16 pounds

640
00:48:53.78 --> 00:49:02.26
I'll tell you this right now. I'll talk in a jodie minute about this briefly too. I'll tell you this right now if even at 40 you go on this thing

641
00:49:02.26 --> 00:49:06.42
It depends on your pain. No, no go on this this type of work

642
00:49:06.42 --> 00:49:11.22
And I'm not even like selling this work on or nothing like that. I'm saying this so people will think and think you know what though?

643
00:49:11.62 --> 00:49:16.34
Okay people think you're on steroids if you do this work off or like six weeks that's it six weeks

644
00:49:16.34 --> 00:49:21.78
They'll think you're on steroids straight up like my whole life when I'd like go on a pro on a like a six week thing

645
00:49:21.78 --> 00:49:26.98
They're all he's on serrits. Obviously he's on serrits. It's no serrits. You only have to take supplements. That's the weird thing

646
00:49:27.46 --> 00:49:32.66
But here. Let me see this though now that I'm thinking of it as or about it when I'm grown adult

647
00:49:32.66 --> 00:49:37.14
Most programs if you actually do the whole program

648
00:49:38.02 --> 00:49:40.02
Exactly works

649
00:49:40.02 --> 00:49:46.42
Really good that's the thing people just don't do the work up. Yeah, like it's like oh, what do you need to do lift heavy weights a lot

650
00:49:47.62 --> 00:49:53.14
Eat good and rest good. Yeah, yeah, you'll get yeah, and let's and let's face it

651
00:49:53.94 --> 00:49:59.06
It's not is like if someone says oh, yeah, it's easy. Here's the thing. It's not easy. This is why it's not easy

652
00:49:59.06 --> 00:50:04.26
It's not just the workout that's why you have to do the workout then you have to eat enough of the right things do by the way

653
00:50:04.26 --> 00:50:07.78
And then you have to rest enough. That's basically you have to change your whole life

654
00:50:08.02 --> 00:50:11.38
So if you're like it's easy just change your whole life. It's not easy

655
00:50:11.38 --> 00:50:14.42
So and not that I'm not saying that that's a good excuse or anything

656
00:50:14.42 --> 00:50:17.38
But I'm just saying it's not quote unquote easy, but yeah, there it is

657
00:50:17.38 --> 00:50:25.10
But check do where a diet exercise eat good workout good and rest good you'd be good hotel or gym easy

658
00:50:25.10 --> 00:50:30.06
That actually here's what you can do here's what I do when I go to the master or wherever

659
00:50:30.06 --> 00:50:36.06
If I'm there for like a week like the last master all like going Google maps and finding like all the gyms

660
00:50:36.62 --> 00:50:39.82
And be like all right, I'm gonna get that's kind of the commitment

661
00:50:40.22 --> 00:50:43.58
Obviously, you know, that's an interest. That's your commitment like you want to stay in shape

662
00:50:44.06 --> 00:50:48.38
Add mass as you say conditioning adding mass whatever look for the gym near your house

663
00:50:48.38 --> 00:50:54.70
Commit to pay that gym fee. It's just like what 10 bucks or something like that and boom that's the commitment right

664
00:50:55.90 --> 00:50:57.90
Do that that's what I do

665
00:50:57.90 --> 00:51:00.90
Same thing with you just about all the next question

666
00:51:01.86 --> 00:51:05.10
Forgive or wait to settle the score

667
00:51:07.50 --> 00:51:13.74
You know what this is kind of a question. Okay, so forgive

668
00:51:13.74 --> 00:51:20.70
If you can forgive people for me, that's cool now here's the thing got that little thing eaten in the back of your mind because you want to settle the score

669
00:51:20.70 --> 00:51:25.26
I know I feel you really don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't tell you like hey just forgiving forget right

670
00:51:25.26 --> 00:51:28.30
But but it's hard to do that sometimes especially if

671
00:51:28.94 --> 00:51:31.34
Well certain situations merit, you know a little bit

672
00:51:31.74 --> 00:51:38.90
It's hard to make that happen a little something extra special, but this is what's interesting for giving someone is actually

673
00:51:40.10 --> 00:51:41.90
A form of settling the score

674
00:51:41.90 --> 00:51:43.90
Maybe you can think about that so

675
00:51:44.70 --> 00:51:48.38
for me the best revenge you can take on someone is

676
00:51:49.82 --> 00:51:55.42
Success right is ignoring them and the best revenge is not even letting them know

677
00:51:57.02 --> 00:52:00.06
That you even think about it anymore

678
00:52:00.78 --> 00:52:05.02
That's the best revenge in my mind so you forgive them and you just move on

679
00:52:05.02 --> 00:52:09.54
I think that's the best thing to do forgive them move on and go kick ass in the world and

680
00:52:09.54 --> 00:52:13.22
And the little part of your brain that really wants to take revenge

681
00:52:13.46 --> 00:52:21.30
You'll be taking the best possible revenge you can you'll be doing the best possible way and it'll be the best for you as a human being yeah

682
00:52:21.78 --> 00:52:27.50
So that's what you do. Yeah, yeah, I forgive you and then you go kick ass

683
00:52:28.86 --> 00:52:34.42
For giving someone for real like for real for real for giving them is really hard

684
00:52:34.82 --> 00:52:38.90
Even if you do take the high road behavior wise on the inside it's like you kind of don't

685
00:52:38.90 --> 00:52:44.74
There's this guy high school actually when I mean high school was you're so high school grudges no

686
00:52:45.22 --> 00:52:47.46
I get I guess technically yeah

687
00:52:48.62 --> 00:52:55.78
It's still there like if there was like if you were to see I don't know something good that I did like now and be like

688
00:52:55.78 --> 00:53:01.14
Oh, man, he's doing good that would give me satisfaction right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's still there. I'm gonna something

689
00:53:01.86 --> 00:53:03.38
but

690
00:53:03.38 --> 00:53:05.38
if it's

691
00:53:05.38 --> 00:53:12.70
To forgive someone fully to be to a point where oh, yeah, if you saw that I was doing great now or something like that

692
00:53:13.30 --> 00:53:18.22
And that wouldn't move me either way to get to that point is resupar art

693
00:53:18.58 --> 00:53:23.14
So I think just like how you said like the behavior that you want to kind of

694
00:53:23.50 --> 00:53:25.50
You want to be in act. Yeah is

695
00:53:26.94 --> 00:53:33.38
Is yeah, don't let it bother you and here's the thing with don't not letting it not not letting by the don't let it affect you at all

696
00:53:33.38 --> 00:53:37.94
Like no factor like you almost like you didn't even notice kind of air. Okay, so that's hard to do

697
00:53:37.94 --> 00:53:42.14
Right answer you were there. Yes, you can do that if you can pull that off

698
00:53:42.26 --> 00:53:47.26
But that's the worst for the other person say it so like you ever you ever had like

699
00:53:48.98 --> 00:53:51.86
Maybe what I'm saying but bro I'll get this where like

700
00:53:51.86 --> 00:53:56.54
Did I say you know you think to yourself dang did I see something to piss that guy off wherever it is whatever

701
00:53:56.54 --> 00:53:58.66
I don't know somebody where that girl or whatever

702
00:53:58.66 --> 00:54:03.22
Shoot did I say something are they offended whatever and you just don't quite know

703
00:54:03.22 --> 00:54:07.98
But it's not big enough to bring up so you can't bring it up and get that satisfaction of knowing you know

704
00:54:08.14 --> 00:54:14.98
But if they don't just don't say any let's say they were offended say it don't even like you but they just don't don't like talk to you rather than

705
00:54:15.54 --> 00:54:17.78
If they ignore you or

706
00:54:18.42 --> 00:54:21.30
Don't acknowledge that you said something or something like that

707
00:54:21.30 --> 00:54:24.22
That's way more that bothers you way more than them like

708
00:54:24.22 --> 00:54:32.14
Custon you out or something or yelling at you like I'm super mad at you and them telling you they're mad at you is way more like sad as

709
00:54:32.14 --> 00:54:39.26
Like yeah, then them not if you just ghost them forgive them and move on yeah, but if you ghost them

710
00:54:40.50 --> 00:54:43.94
You can't overly ghost like you can't overly ignore

711
00:54:43.94 --> 00:54:46.78
Just be like hey, yeah, like literally like

712
00:54:47.02 --> 00:54:51.58
Yeah, yeah, oh good. Yeah, it's good to see you have to know that's why something's going good for you if

713
00:54:51.58 --> 00:54:57.16
It's like you're mad at someone and they text you like hey, you know

714
00:54:57.16 --> 00:55:02.54
Oh, and if you give them like one word answers or you don't text them back that messes with them way worse than you say

715
00:55:02.54 --> 00:55:05.62
Yes, I met at you and you hurt me and you pissed me off

716
00:55:05.62 --> 00:55:08.54
Whatever, I ain't all these games over them. Don't brag. I laid it for me, bro

717
00:55:10.70 --> 00:55:17.52
Check good advice right there good advice next question when you you've crushed your daily to do list

718
00:55:17.52 --> 00:55:21.76
Do you then take the time to relax or do you text him next day's list?

719
00:55:22.76 --> 00:55:27.28
Is that against prioritize an execute since the mission is done for the day?

720
00:55:27.28 --> 00:55:30.000
You know just do more just keep going

721
00:55:30.56 --> 00:55:36.56
Even if it's on the next day keep going do more if you have extra time do whatever you can do to stay ahead

722
00:55:36.56 --> 00:55:42.36
And I do that pretty much until I'm brain dead and I I can definitely work myself into it until I'm brain dead

723
00:55:42.36 --> 00:55:46.20
Like I can get to a point where I'm reading or I'm writing and it's just it's just it's just done

724
00:55:46.20 --> 00:55:51.68
I'm done and so I just have to stop and take a break and I'll go do something mindless for a while

725
00:55:51.92 --> 00:55:57.68
You know, so you know if you forgot stuff to do keep hammering until you can't hammer anymore and then say

726
00:55:57.68 --> 00:56:03.36
Oh, okay, you know what? I need a little breather and then take a little breather and then get back to it right now

727
00:56:03.36 --> 00:56:05.36
I could work 24 hours a day

728
00:56:06.36 --> 00:56:10.64
24 hours a day yeah seven days a week 365 days a year and

729
00:56:11.56 --> 00:56:14.000
And I wouldn't be able to get done things I'm trying to get done

730
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:19.60
So it's not like I'm sitting there going oh cool. I got a break no. Yeah, I can save all I has got as more stuff to do

731
00:56:20.12 --> 00:56:25.92
Got things to do so not a bunch of boys you call it breaks and it relaxing

732
00:56:25.92 --> 00:56:32.36
That's not a lot of that happened right now now go surfing is that a break kind of it's like a big break

733
00:56:32.36 --> 00:56:36.52
Well, it's kind of hard of the process. It's like if you're doing five sets of 10 on the bench

734
00:56:38.44 --> 00:56:39.64
What are you gonna do?

735
00:56:39.64 --> 00:56:44.20
One set of 50 no you do find sets of 10 so first set of 10 what do you do get a rest?

736
00:56:44.20 --> 00:56:49.88
Get a recover that's what surfing is that's the it's the rest between sets. That's all that is right there. You go as part of the process

737
00:56:50.96 --> 00:56:52.48
check

738
00:56:52.48 --> 00:56:56.44
But what would you would you recommend for someone who's like a normal person?

739
00:56:56.68 --> 00:57:01.52
Do what you can knock it out build up extra three time if you need a break take a break

740
00:57:03.40 --> 00:57:05.40
Got you that's pretty crazy right?

741
00:57:05.40 --> 00:57:11.72
No, what I'm saying is like do what you can if you need a break take a break if you need a little relaxation takes some relaxation

742
00:57:11.72 --> 00:57:16.48
You know waste your time though see people people do relaxing, but they do what they don't even do it good

743
00:57:16.80 --> 00:57:24.16
They don't even feel relaxed when they get done. It's not productive relaxing. Yeah, they're they just what they did is they did something stupid for an hour

744
00:57:24.32 --> 00:57:28.12
They watched YouTube videos for an hour. Yeah, they did that help you know

745
00:57:28.24 --> 00:57:32.12
Godside go for a run do some burpees go surfing go do some jiu-jitsu

746
00:57:32.12 --> 00:57:37.96
Play with your kids whatever do something that actually has some value. Yeah, the real value

747
00:57:38.60 --> 00:57:44.32
But to what about you know, palhana and we're going to the bar

748
00:57:45.60 --> 00:57:50.24
Yeah, that's not great, but sometimes you get to hammer because you're hung over the next day

749
00:57:50.24 --> 00:57:55.24
You can't account you know you can't function as good boom can't your output your productivity

750
00:57:55.24 --> 00:57:56.24
Cause down next day

751
00:57:56.24 --> 00:58:01.56
Better tell everyone what palhana means because not everyone knows like all pahana. I guess technically it means

752
00:58:02.76 --> 00:58:06.60
Done with what you're doing palhana means done Hanam means like do yeah

753
00:58:07.52 --> 00:58:14.08
But yeah, palhana, a potential what you're doing tip it's referred to when you're finished with work. Yeah, that's where I was used

754
00:58:15.36 --> 00:58:22.36
You know, yeah when you finish or palhana go good. Yeah, you know, whatever. It's like Miller time. You know, that's the same thing a little bit

755
00:58:22.36 --> 00:58:29.84
Next question. Would you recommend jiu-jitsu for a 55 year old female with no former martial arts background

756
00:58:30.48 --> 00:58:35.92
Is the risk for injury to lie? Yeah, I can't say this on a bunch of times. Hey, yes, you should do jiu-jitsu

757
00:58:36.28 --> 00:58:43.000
Pick good training partners get your ego out of the picture and go very slow and learn the techniques and you'll get something out of it

758
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.44
Yeah, watch out for sparring rolling live

759
00:58:46.44 --> 00:58:52.90
You need to be really careful and you need to really select good training partners that are very much more experienced than you are

760
00:58:53.16 --> 00:59:00.60
Don't roll with white belts if you're a 55 don't even roll with blue belts if you can help it as a 55 year old unless they're small and smart

761
00:59:00.88 --> 00:59:04.76
Just be careful, but yeah, it's a great training. It's a great thing. What about?

762
00:59:05.48 --> 00:59:08.20
Because I actually got assist online and I was actually

763
00:59:08.84 --> 00:59:13.76
Through DMs like going through this a girl class him tailor if I'm not mistaken

764
00:59:13.76 --> 00:59:16.92
You got a first name anyway, should black belt and she

765
00:59:17.76 --> 00:59:21.52
You know when it comes to girls rolling just even just regular girls or whatever

766
00:59:21.52 --> 00:59:27.72
Let's face it. I mean in training they do have a bigger kind of kind of obstacle in that way where they're at

767
00:59:27.92 --> 00:59:32.96
They are at a higher risk of injury more times because everyone if they're rolling with the guys

768
00:59:32.96 --> 00:59:37.72
I mean everyone chances are everyone's bigger than them and they might be going hard and they you know

769
00:59:37.72 --> 00:59:41.96
Some guys especially early on they don't realize that dang they're putting a lot of strength and

770
00:59:41.96 --> 00:59:45.44
And you know all the stuff into these moves again. I can't even guys like

771
00:59:48.44 --> 00:59:53.24
Yeah, they don't even realize it. They're that weird exhausted. Yeah, I am relaxed

772
00:59:55.96 --> 01:00:00.44
Exactly where they do have this obstacle. It's right even 55 year old

773
01:00:00.96 --> 01:00:03.72
Lady or even just an older person in general

774
01:00:04.20 --> 01:00:08.68
They do have that added obstacle where yeah, you do have to kind of so what's the question yeah?

775
01:00:08.68 --> 01:00:14.44
The question is like what do those people do? Yeah same deal. Yeah, no they they have to be more

776
01:00:14.68 --> 01:00:19.56
Extremely cautious they have to take more caution. Oh, okay. You're 100% right. What you're saying is right

777
01:00:20.16 --> 01:00:23.72
You didn't and what is what I just said you don't want to go with the psycho white belt

778
01:00:23.72 --> 01:00:25.72
You even want to go with any white belt right

779
01:00:26.04 --> 01:00:32.28
Yeah, because they're they don't know what they're doing so go with someone that's a purple belt someone that's relaxed there

780
01:00:32.92 --> 01:00:34.92
55 year old woman is gonna be on a different

781
01:00:34.92 --> 01:00:36.92
A

782
01:00:36.92 --> 01:00:39.96
Pace down the path. Gonna be on the path but just at a different pace

783
01:00:39.96 --> 01:00:46.28
Yeah, and and the stress is to I would focus on the the learning of the technique a lot more

784
01:00:46.76 --> 01:00:48.76
You know, it's been a lot more time drilling and

785
01:00:49.32 --> 01:00:55.48
Learning the technique and then occasionally with your black belt instructor with your brown belt instructor with some of the high level

786
01:00:55.88 --> 01:00:57.88
Purple belt smart people

787
01:00:58.28 --> 01:01:02.84
You do nice little roll with them you have some fun. You see what works. What doesn't work you learn a little bit more

788
01:01:02.84 --> 01:01:08.60
Take that path take a pace down the path. All right, right don't go in there with a big ego and

789
01:01:09.24 --> 01:01:11.24
Here what happens every time like

790
01:01:12.12 --> 01:01:18.92
If you introduce to you to people they think that they have the solution to something that you teach right

791
01:01:19.80 --> 01:01:23.96
And it's like no you don't actually have the solution you are don't know anything

792
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.60
So just just don't do that. Yeah, is that the monster and you know we teach you just for the first time too much people

793
01:01:30.60 --> 01:01:34.68
And we're teaching the oopa right do the oopa escape the oopa escape

794
01:01:35.56 --> 01:01:37.56
Where you roll the person over from the mountain and

795
01:01:38.28 --> 01:01:43.000
This one guy, you know, he's like I'm teaching what's doing this one guy is like I

796
01:01:43.56 --> 01:01:47.80
Look this doesn't work and he's got his weight all the way in the other side. He's got his leg up

797
01:01:47.80 --> 01:01:52.68
I remember that yeah, and I'm like I'm like yeah, there's another movie just do this pop up and now you're in the garden

798
01:01:54.04 --> 01:01:57.56
But like in his mind like you just just told me wasn't it but doesn't that's a work

799
01:01:57.56 --> 01:02:01.56
I don't know what this crap is that joc was all into but obviously doesn't work

800
01:02:02.12 --> 01:02:08.20
So no actually it works so you don't you don't uncover the magic of jiu-jitsu in one

801
01:02:09.08 --> 01:02:10.84
Moment, you know

802
01:02:10.84 --> 01:02:15.56
Yeah, oh actually you know what I do remember the question so you know how it like kid fit five year old women

803
01:02:16.04 --> 01:02:20.36
Roll with you know high level people people that you trust people who have like a lot of control over the

804
01:02:20.36 --> 01:02:27.24
The situation what about like let's say I you know on the 55 year old woman avatuin sister she's 55

805
01:02:27.24 --> 01:02:33.32
We're in the same shape kind of thing just normal people and can we roll you better be careful

806
01:02:33.48 --> 01:02:37.48
You better calm down you better not get competitive you better relax

807
01:02:38.36 --> 01:02:41.32
Now one thing that's good is I would say yes actually

808
01:02:41.56 --> 01:02:47.16
Yeah, I would say yes thinking you know why because you're around equivalent strength you're around equivalent knowledge

809
01:02:47.16 --> 01:02:51.40
You still got to be careful. Yeah, I would prefer you go a couple six months before

810
01:02:51.96 --> 01:02:55.72
Before you jump in and do a death match with your twin sister at age 55

811
01:02:55.72 --> 01:02:58.52
Yeah, I know you you've been competing with each other

812
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.12
So just just trying to relax you know I just say Jade trying to kill you like dude

813
01:03:04.68 --> 01:03:11.08
Come on when Jade used to try no sorry. Oh, yeah, he tried sure he could try no I know that's what's saying he tried

814
01:03:11.32 --> 01:03:15.16
It's funny the jay even from birth jay was a little bit bigger than me

815
01:03:15.16 --> 01:03:21.08
Not anymore no no no and I think it's literally a direct result of it of always being a little bit

816
01:03:21.08 --> 01:03:27.72
You had a smaller in complex yeah, you like a little small mini micro bit bigger than this dude and you know when that happened

817
01:03:27.72 --> 01:03:30.44
He was bigger than me through high school through through

818
01:03:31.24 --> 01:03:33.96
Even through college you bigger than me until

819
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.28
We're done kind of with college and also just gonna lift and I ballooned up to like almost 250

820
01:03:40.28 --> 01:03:46.60
Pay 250 and then he was like were you athletic when you were 250 yeah surprisingly yet not as fast

821
01:03:46.60 --> 01:03:52.12
Back up there again. I was it as flet oh, I was off, you know, you know a grown adult

822
01:03:52.52 --> 01:03:54.12
It doesn't make sense for me. I'm not

823
01:03:54.76 --> 01:03:58.52
Paul I don't know this is my opinion and plus in a whole lane 250

824
01:03:59.08 --> 01:04:02.68
Not as lean as I am now no I wouldn't call myself lean or

825
01:04:04.12 --> 01:04:08.84
But I wasn't fat though. That's a thing I even have this old picture of me in my friend Scottie

826
01:04:08.84 --> 01:04:10.84
He's a cop now by the way he

827
01:04:11.24 --> 01:04:14.20
We're like because he would lift it. He was a little bit important

828
01:04:15.32 --> 01:04:17.32
Yeah big time and

829
01:04:17.72 --> 01:04:22.84
We were like this is when I was like 245 he was like maybe 230 or something like that and yeah, I was big

830
01:04:22.84 --> 01:04:27.24
But I was like that was like surprisingly defined though. I got it that day. I got it that day. I

831
01:04:27.96 --> 01:04:32.92
That's and then I went and ran a four mile run and I and I did not feel good

832
01:04:32.92 --> 01:04:37.40
Yeah, and I was like okay. I'm done with this. Yes, I mean, I was pumped to be 250 just because you know

833
01:04:37.40 --> 01:04:44.52
You're 50 but I ended it a four mile run. I was like good God. This is horrible. Yeah, I can't do my job and that's the answer

834
01:04:44.52 --> 01:04:47.80
Yeah, that's the answer why you don't want to be 250 and even

835
01:04:48.36 --> 01:04:53.72
Like that's a huge amount of weight even health wise especially as you get older whatever like to be

836
01:04:54.20 --> 01:04:56.20
Just rolling around 250

837
01:04:57.24 --> 01:04:59.96
Yeah, and if you can't do a four mile ride if you can't do I probably

838
01:05:00.68 --> 01:05:05.88
Thinking back like even a one mile run would have been kind of kind of more difficult to get out with a

839
01:05:05.88 --> 01:05:13.16
Like at 250 that's not a good sign. Yeah, the last that's uh that's how it went

840
01:05:14.04 --> 01:05:21.80
So yeah, it's the point they're being I got bigger than than Jade boom and with that little micro Napoleon complex

841
01:05:21.80 --> 01:05:26.60
It grew like I was more like aggressive or am even still not like more like

842
01:05:27.96 --> 01:05:30.44
I'll take up more aggressive like I started to

843
01:05:30.44 --> 01:05:36.60
You need to consider I started to just take a lot more aggressive more aggressive more

844
01:05:37.24 --> 01:05:41.32
That's one because I don't figure about that way you think Jade's more aggressive

845
01:05:42.12 --> 01:05:45.64
Maybe like to get in like a debate or something. Yeah, definitely aggressive

846
01:05:47.48 --> 01:05:53.56
But yeah, physical activity I'd probably start due to I was like before Jade started I was like well into purple belt

847
01:05:53.56 --> 01:05:55.56
Yeah, for Jade even started

848
01:05:55.56 --> 01:06:02.12
And that's a big gap. So yeah, Jake can try to kill me. He will not kill me just simply won't it's almost impossible

849
01:06:02.12 --> 01:06:04.12
It's pretty much

850
01:06:04.12 --> 01:06:06.12
Technically impossible if there's

851
01:06:06.12 --> 01:06:13.56
Oh, so if you go a percentage right chance you can't ever beating me the percent of the percent chance of him beating me

852
01:06:14.12 --> 01:06:20.76
Is close to the zero that it is one percent true that's how it is right now the almost you went on the complete warpath

853
01:06:20.76 --> 01:06:25.52
Oh, what do you mean if he trained just try to try it all the time? Yeah, that goes for everybody

854
01:06:25.80 --> 01:06:32.76
Currently that's all it is. Oh, yeah, so he's a zero percent he's off the path doesn't matter he can get on the path still

855
01:06:33.88 --> 01:06:39.16
Zero percent chance next question. I'd like to hear your thoughts on people entering the military in their 30s

856
01:06:39.88 --> 01:06:41.88
I'm sure you saw it

857
01:06:41.88 --> 01:06:48.12
How they fare and ring the military at an old rage is fine. You got maturity you got experience you got intelligence

858
01:06:48.12 --> 01:06:53.88
And so that's good. You're gonna bring a lot to the table. However you also have maturity experience and intelligence

859
01:06:53.88 --> 01:07:00.52
So the only downfall of it is you got to do some dumb stuff on your in the military and and and if you're older and

860
01:07:00.84 --> 01:07:03.92
You see how dumb some of the stuff that you're doing is

861
01:07:04.52 --> 01:07:09.48
It's gonna be harder for you to do it. You're gonna have a little bit of a negative attitude on if you allow yourself

862
01:07:09.48 --> 01:07:15.000
It'd be easy if I should say that if you allow yourself it'd be easy to develop a negative attitude about that stuff

863
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.60
I joined when I was 18 years old I didn't care you want me to do whatever you want me to do

864
01:07:20.60 --> 01:07:25.72
I'll do it. I didn't see this stupidity and a lot of the stuff and so I think that's the only drawback

865
01:07:25.72 --> 01:07:28.28
Because you'll just be looking at some of the stuff that you do in the military thinking oh

866
01:07:28.28 --> 01:07:31.80
This is much more efficient way to do this and if you let that get to you it's gonna be problematic

867
01:07:32.12 --> 01:07:39.16
So going there with an open mind do the crap the the tedious and kind of mindless stuff that you got to do and

868
01:07:39.48 --> 01:07:43.80
Push through that and then you'll get to a position or leadership and you can do your best to mitigate that and take care of other

869
01:07:43.80 --> 01:07:45.80
Soldiers sailors airman and Marines

870
01:07:46.92 --> 01:07:53.16
While you're out there serving the country. So yeah, it's awesome. It's great. You'll you'll be a big benefit. Mm-hmm

871
01:07:53.16 --> 01:07:55.16
Do you think that that even that

872
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.12
How you're saying like okay you'll you'll you kind of look at things in more of an adult way kind of thing

873
01:08:02.12 --> 01:08:03.64
Where it's like all this more efficient way to do something

874
01:08:03.64 --> 01:08:10.60
Do you think that that mindset would kind of keep you from you know being more cohesive to with a few allow it to it

875
01:08:10.60 --> 01:08:14.36
Definitely will if you if you that's why I said you have to allow if you just go look

876
01:08:14.36 --> 01:08:18.68
This is this is the way it is right now. I'm a I'm a E1 in the military

877
01:08:18.92 --> 01:08:21.80
They're telling me to do this thing. It doesn't make any sense right now

878
01:08:22.36 --> 01:08:27.16
I'm gonna do it to the best of my ability and move forward if you say all this is stupid

879
01:08:27.16 --> 01:08:30.92
And you spread the negativity the other guys know why we doing this. Yeah, it's gonna be problematic

880
01:08:30.92 --> 01:08:35.08
So going there have a good attitude you can promote really quickly if you're square away like that

881
01:08:35.08 --> 01:08:36.76
You know, so you got a good opportunity

882
01:08:36.76 --> 01:08:41.64
How do you I think it's totally good to go what about even like socially you know like kind of like

883
01:08:41.64 --> 01:08:46.52
Oh, you want to think about it. You're 30 years or 18 you've been out in the world. You've had a job

884
01:08:46.52 --> 01:08:52.04
You probably have a house. You might have kids these kids are I was out of high school like you know what I mean

885
01:08:52.04 --> 01:08:55.56
It's you're not there yet you're and you think about

886
01:08:56.92 --> 01:09:00.68
What you know when you're that age compared to what when you're when you're 30

887
01:09:00.76 --> 01:09:03.40
Yeah, you know my big things. I tell my kids all time. You know

888
01:09:03.40 --> 01:09:07.24
Or like my oldest daughter who's in college and whatnot

889
01:09:07.24 --> 01:09:11.32
And I'm always like when I was your age. I was my first you'll put to you know like

890
01:09:12.04 --> 01:09:14.52
You're just kidding even compete with what I was doing

891
01:09:14.52 --> 01:09:18.76
The responsibility and I had when I was 18 years. I know all that stuff

892
01:09:19.40 --> 01:09:25.96
But but the truth is when you're 18 you're not as mature as you are when you're 30 so yeah, there'll be a social disconnect

893
01:09:25.96 --> 01:09:27.96
Like I went to college when I was

894
01:09:27.96 --> 01:09:34.52
I think I was 28 or 29 or 30 and so yeah, I was around kids that were 18 19 years old and I

895
01:09:34.84 --> 01:09:38.04
Realized very quickly that you know you'd made some mature kids

896
01:09:38.04 --> 01:09:42.20
But a lot of kids were just they're just young. Yeah, I mean there's not a big difference between 18 and 15

897
01:09:42.92 --> 01:09:44.60
For some people right yeah

898
01:09:44.60 --> 01:09:49.24
You think about what you were doing you were 15 years old 16 years old like I'd join the military

899
01:09:49.24 --> 01:09:51.72
So luckily I had some kind of structure imposed upon me

900
01:09:51.72 --> 01:09:59.16
Yeah, but you think about the kind of stuff that you can do when you're 18 years old people do dumb dumb dumb stuff

901
01:10:00.60 --> 01:10:04.52
You you you look back and you you're happy that you made it

902
01:10:05.48 --> 01:10:13.72
Yeah, you do dumb stuff yeah, you know we're talking about wasting your time on YouTube videos go waste your time on YouTube

903
01:10:14.28 --> 01:10:16.52
Like just put in like you know

904
01:10:16.76 --> 01:10:18.76
Teenagers doing dumb stuff

905
01:10:18.76 --> 01:10:24.52
And you'll you'll save out and in 50% of the stuff that you see you'll recognize

906
01:10:25.24 --> 01:10:30.20
Like oh yeah, I remember that so yeah, don't do dumb stuff and as an 30 year old in the military

907
01:10:30.20 --> 01:10:34.28
You can help give some of that guidance to people so I think it's cool go for it man and kind of vice versa

908
01:10:34.28 --> 01:10:36.60
Right cuz like if you're the 18 year old 19 year old guy

909
01:10:36.76 --> 01:10:43.64
There's like you know 100 well however many other 18 19 year old guys you guys are cruising then here comes this 30 year old

910
01:10:43.64 --> 01:10:49.000
You know all level headed bro. I can't relate to this guy this kid's kind of weird that the other thing is when you're 18

911
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
You don't even know how much those 30 year olds

912
01:10:51.40 --> 01:10:57.40
You just think you know you actually think you know more than you're looking at them like the 80 it's like why would you not

913
01:10:57.80 --> 01:10:58.92
You know

914
01:10:58.92 --> 01:11:03.32
Swing off this rope and see if you can get through the window on the third floor

915
01:11:03.32 --> 01:11:05.32
Why would you not do that?

916
01:11:05.32 --> 01:11:11.48
Yeah, exactly so that's something I would be out brace yourself for that to remember the perspective of an 18 year old and

917
01:11:11.48 --> 01:11:14.44
They're not looking at you going gosh, I'd really like to learn about the area

918
01:11:14.68 --> 01:11:17.80
I'm looking at you like I can't believe you're doing the military what's wrong with you

919
01:11:18.36 --> 01:11:19.64
Yeah, old man. Yeah, old man

920
01:11:19.64 --> 01:11:25.96
There is there were guys who actually they came from the military and still eligible right for for footpoint college and

921
01:11:26.52 --> 01:11:28.84
One guy was 26 one guy was 27 and

922
01:11:29.56 --> 01:11:32.92
It let's think let's face it 26.7 that's you know that's you're

923
01:11:33.08 --> 01:11:38.84
Physically like you're solid still and we looked at them like man these are like these are old school guys

924
01:11:38.84 --> 01:11:40.84
These are like old one careful with my own practice

925
01:11:40.84 --> 01:11:48.12
Yeah, like literally it was like I felt like that for one of the guys anyway and then you go to class right in you get these people who you know

926
01:11:48.12 --> 01:11:53.72
They don't go to college right after high school. They go, you know later on when in my opinion when most of us should go

927
01:11:53.88 --> 01:11:57.88
When you know why you're going and so this one lady was in my class. She was maybe 35

928
01:11:59.08 --> 01:12:01.08
Six whatever

929
01:12:01.08 --> 01:12:04.60
Did you look at you with the scust all day long? No, she didn't look at me at all. Oh wow she's freaking like

930
01:12:04.60 --> 01:12:11.48
Donner on program. Yeah, like I was no factor in her life before she was doing yeah literally the correct way to do it. She sat up front

931
01:12:12.04 --> 01:12:14.68
Weird oh yeah, and she's asking questions

932
01:12:16.12 --> 01:12:18.68
Literally, and that's really the way to go when you think about it

933
01:12:18.68 --> 01:12:21.40
You don't even have to think about that's the way to go, but nonetheless

934
01:12:21.40 --> 01:12:25.72
She's like this, but she's obviously 30 something years old and it just didn't compute to me

935
01:12:25.72 --> 01:12:27.72
You know like oh

936
01:12:27.72 --> 01:12:33.08
That's the most important thing one on us, but that's a really key part of this conversation is when you're eight

937
01:12:33.08 --> 01:12:36.84
Imagine as a 30 year old when you're looking at that 18 year old they don't see

938
01:12:37.88 --> 01:12:39.88
I understand

939
01:12:39.88 --> 01:12:41.88
So check

940
01:12:41.88 --> 01:12:43.88
No sir we don't

941
01:12:43.88 --> 01:12:45.88
One

942
01:12:45.88 --> 01:12:47.88
18 next question

943
01:12:48.28 --> 01:12:55.80
You've said everyone will know if you're the one taking ownership and leading the team in spite of having a poor leader or someone who does

944
01:12:56.36 --> 01:12:58.20
Everything for the one glory

945
01:12:58.20 --> 01:13:04.52
But what do you do if your boss is boss doesn't make the connection between your work and the team success

946
01:13:06.68 --> 01:13:08.20
Good

947
01:13:08.20 --> 01:13:12.44
Good, you know what I do keep working hard. That's awesome. Make keep making your boss look good

948
01:13:13.08 --> 01:13:17.96
I recommend that you put your ego in jack because you know we can take credit for for what for what's happening

949
01:13:17.96 --> 01:13:21.96
You're looking for that glory and there the boss is doing it for glory

950
01:13:22.04 --> 01:13:26.52
Well, guess what that's making you mad because you want some of that glory. You know what it'll come

951
01:13:26.52 --> 01:13:31.40
The two things about this number one let him have it make him look great

952
01:13:31.72 --> 01:13:36.84
You worried that the boss's boss doesn't get it. It will come in due course be patient

953
01:13:37.56 --> 01:13:38.76
Work hard

954
01:13:38.76 --> 01:13:45.32
Give your boss the credit don't worry about it and in due course it will come you you can't fool

955
01:13:45.80 --> 01:13:48.36
The boss the boss is boss won't get fooled forever

956
01:13:48.76 --> 01:13:54.04
They won't get fooled forever and you know what or is case scenario you get your boss's you get your boss promoted

957
01:13:54.04 --> 01:13:59.88
Cool now he trusts you you work hard for him. You did good. He put you can take his role

958
01:14:00.44 --> 01:14:02.44
It's okay

959
01:14:02.44 --> 01:14:05.16
Okay, this is very common. This is no

960
01:14:06.04 --> 01:14:08.04
Strange question

961
01:14:09.96 --> 01:14:11.96
Next question

962
01:14:12.44 --> 01:14:15.88
What do you do for fun when you're not kidding after it? I?

963
01:14:16.28 --> 01:14:17.88
That's kind of a weird question

964
01:14:17.88 --> 01:14:22.12
Right? Why because you're always getting enough well because is surfing getting after it? Yeah

965
01:14:22.12 --> 01:14:27.16
It actually is you're getting after it. Yeah, it is getting after it is playing guitar getting after it

966
01:14:27.16 --> 01:14:30.44
Well, yes, it is is rocking roll band getting after it. Yes, it is

967
01:14:31.48 --> 01:14:32.52
Okay, I guess

968
01:14:32.52 --> 01:14:38.44
And I'm hanging with my kids is that getting after it? Sometimes I kind of it turns out what we're doing guess

969
01:14:38.44 --> 01:14:40.60
We're doing jitsu so yeah, I don't know

970
01:14:41.32 --> 01:14:43.32
What I do for fun when I'm not getting after it?

971
01:14:44.04 --> 01:14:47.80
Just stuff that I enjoy doing like you said earlier like it doesn't take discipline

972
01:14:47.80 --> 01:14:53.56
To go and do jitsu if jitsu is really fun for you and jitsu is definitely fun for me. I would say

973
01:14:54.04 --> 01:14:56.04
70% of the time

974
01:14:56.60 --> 01:15:02.60
I'm I'm like super stoked to be going and roll 30% of the time. I don't feel like it. I go anyways

975
01:15:03.16 --> 01:15:08.36
Or say 28% of the time sure there's like two percent of the time where I recognize oh

976
01:15:08.36 --> 01:15:12.84
I'm gonna get hurt today because I'm beat up or I'm tired or whatever

977
01:15:13.16 --> 01:15:15.16
It's like okay, you know what?

978
01:15:15.16 --> 01:15:20.68
Maybe I won't try today yeah or and even on those days sometimes I'll come in and I'll just do a light roll

979
01:15:21.48 --> 01:15:22.68
Just to make sure

980
01:15:22.68 --> 01:15:24.68
Put myself a little discipline check

981
01:15:25.48 --> 01:15:28.20
So yeah, I don't know people that that's the kind of the thing where

982
01:15:28.76 --> 01:15:33.96
I guess from other people's perspective if they're thinking jitsu is not fun and working out is not fun and and

983
01:15:35.72 --> 01:15:39.64
Practicing an instrument is not fun well than I'm not ever having any fun

984
01:15:39.64 --> 01:15:44.68
Yeah, but actually the opposite is true all those things are fun for me so I'm having fun all the time. There you go

985
01:15:45.24 --> 01:15:47.24
Yeah, it kind of kind of goes

986
01:15:47.88 --> 01:15:52.92
In line with them that other question of mindless like do you ever do mindless stuff? So maybe that's kind of the

987
01:15:52.92 --> 01:15:56.68
No work. Oh, yeah yard work cleaning the garage

988
01:15:57.56 --> 01:16:03.000
Stuff like that, but you know actually you know what it is now that I think of it. It's the the question could be could be

989
01:16:03.64 --> 01:16:08.68
Do you what do you do fun meaning what do you do like mindless stuff that's that's not

990
01:16:08.68 --> 01:16:12.52
Technically productive so you say turf surfing

991
01:16:13.72 --> 01:16:17.48
Me surfing is not technically productive. I don't know though. So it's one of those things

992
01:16:17.48 --> 01:16:20.44
But you know what you feel good when you get out of the water. I mean you get a little workout

993
01:16:20.44 --> 01:16:23.64
Actually it is because you get better at surfing. Yeah, so it is kind of productive

994
01:16:23.64 --> 01:16:25.96
But there's no there's no productivity to surfing. There's no

995
01:16:26.84 --> 01:16:28.84
There's no ultimate goal

996
01:16:28.84 --> 01:16:33.08
Other than doing it itself. Yeah same thing with guitar, but you're getting better at guitar

997
01:16:33.08 --> 01:16:39.88
So like even like yard work for example. It's like sure that's not your mind. Yeah, that's productive

998
01:16:39.88 --> 01:16:45.48
You're improved. It's productive. So what you're asking me is what do I do that's completely unproductive?

999
01:16:51.88 --> 01:16:56.28
I don't know right now. There's not a lot of hard to squish in the world. There's not a lot of things right now

1000
01:16:56.28 --> 01:17:01.08
Then I'm doing that art somehow productive. Yeah, I think but anyway because technically

1001
01:17:01.08 --> 01:17:03.48
I'm going to be on the other side because that was the actual question. You're just trying to

1002
01:17:04.28 --> 01:17:06.28
Yeah, I'm all assuming free me

1003
01:17:06.52 --> 01:17:13.08
Presuming the you you know because watching YouTube back to the question watching YouTube videos of like you

1004
01:17:14.20 --> 01:17:20.60
Like try going YouTube actually don't do it, but if you do do it do this go put in the search in YouTube

1005
01:17:21.16 --> 01:17:24.36
Go drunk girl fails. Okay, that's what it's called

1006
01:17:24.36 --> 01:17:31.96
Girl fails. Okay, so there's probably maybe 500,000 to 10 million of these videos potentially that's my estimate

1007
01:17:32.36 --> 01:17:37.80
So what that means is once you're done with one the other one's coming and here's the thing

1008
01:17:38.28 --> 01:17:43.56
It never gets old so that is actually I do think it gets old all right well

1009
01:17:43.56 --> 01:17:47.000
Yeah, that was more of like a really colleague's adoration, but it takes a long time

1010
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:57.32
I would argue for for most of us for it to quote unquote get old so the point there is that is something that is straight up not productive true

1011
01:17:57.32 --> 01:18:03.80
You can learn a lesson much of that the lessons to be learned from those videos get learned literally the first video

1012
01:18:03.80 --> 01:18:09.64
Yeah, literally and then well, no, they don't get learned in the first video because the first one just seems like it could be an anomaly

1013
01:18:09.64 --> 01:18:13.32
It's like when you tap on someone that's never done to just before it takes like three or four before I go

1014
01:18:13.32 --> 01:18:21.08
I get it, you know something I don't know so you gotta watch three to five drunk girl fail videos with your you know

1015
01:18:21.24 --> 01:18:24.68
16-year-old daughter and say like this is why you don't

1016
01:18:25.96 --> 01:18:33.40
Get drunk. Yeah, this is why yeah, actually you know believe me. Okay, we'll watch two more and we'll see if there's any of these things that that you would want to

1017
01:18:33.72 --> 01:18:39.72
See yourself behaving as yeah, but and you could argue that maybe if you watch five six seven ten 20

1018
01:18:39.72 --> 01:18:45.48
You start to see another pattern get revealed within the pattern of drunk girl fails

1019
01:18:45.80 --> 01:18:50.76
So one of them is you know a girl writing a scooter down this path

1020
01:18:51.96 --> 01:18:55.40
So you're not like not just don't get drunk, but don't ride scooters

1021
01:18:55.40 --> 01:19:00.76
Exactly right exactly right. We don't dance on the bar when drunk. Yes, exactly right

1022
01:19:00.76 --> 01:19:06.28
So if you see let's say within the span of 15 drunk girl fail videos you see

1023
01:19:06.28 --> 01:19:08.28
You know

1024
01:19:08.28 --> 01:19:15.32
30 of those is girls dancing on the bar versus only two of them were girls on a scooter

1025
01:19:15.80 --> 01:19:19.24
You can kind of discern that dancing on the bar

1026
01:19:20.52 --> 01:19:22.52
Statistically

1027
01:19:22.52 --> 01:19:26.76
Is a little bit more dangerous. I'm just saying it. Wait we're digging for lessons

1028
01:19:28.04 --> 01:19:30.04
So that's a bad thing

1029
01:19:30.04 --> 01:19:32.04
Digging for lessons is a bad thing

1030
01:19:32.04 --> 01:19:36.68
That wasn't a lesson bro. Sorry digging for lessons next question

1031
01:19:40.20 --> 01:19:46.20
Virtuality requires your favorite subject discipline creativity is important as well

1032
01:19:46.60 --> 01:19:50.20
Does a single focus on discipline inhibit creativity

1033
01:19:52.36 --> 01:19:54.36
No

1034
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Jimmy page next question

1035
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.12
Seriously Jimmy page what a good job

1036
01:20:02.12 --> 01:20:07.48
Jimmy page let's up one good-tarr virtue Oso practice with discipline

1037
01:20:08.76 --> 01:20:12.60
I just answered this on the kids podcast because Jimmy page

1038
01:20:13.48 --> 01:20:15.48
Played guitar so much when he was in school

1039
01:20:16.52 --> 01:20:21.08
That they had to take his guitar from him during like study halls during lunch

1040
01:20:21.64 --> 01:20:25.000
Like no you can't just sit there and play guitar you need to do other things

1041
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.04
Yeah, that's how much he practiced. Yeah, he practiced so much. He became such a

1042
01:20:31.24 --> 01:20:37.64
Such a skilled player through that much discipline that he was able to get more creative

1043
01:20:39.08 --> 01:20:43.32
Then almost anyone else on the guitar so there you go. It doesn't it gives you freedom

1044
01:20:44.52 --> 01:20:46.52
It expands your creativity

1045
01:20:48.44 --> 01:20:51.48
And Jimmy pages one example of a multitude

1046
01:20:51.48 --> 01:20:57.32
So let me ask you this I guess we kind of talked about but not really I've never actually asked you that I can remember

1047
01:20:57.80 --> 01:21:00.44
So if you and let's assume that Jimmy page

1048
01:21:01.48 --> 01:21:05.88
He didn't do it because he felt like this is you know that what I should be doing right now

1049
01:21:05.88 --> 01:21:11.56
Whatever he did just because I'm addicted to guitar. I love it and there's nothing I'd rather be doing and all this stuff

1050
01:21:12.20 --> 01:21:17.64
So if you the question is if you just love doing it and that's why you're doing it so much

1051
01:21:17.64 --> 01:21:23.24
I love guitar. I don't want to eat dinner right now. I'm busy on my guitar

1052
01:21:23.24 --> 01:21:27.72
Just you know enjoying myself and learning and just loving it every single moment of it

1053
01:21:28.76 --> 01:21:33.32
I don't want to go surf on moment guitar. Boom every single day. Is that discipline?

1054
01:21:33.32 --> 01:21:57.56
Yes, because let's say okay actually I don't know I guess not technically

1055
01:21:58.36 --> 01:22:01.88
Yeah, go it is it is it is but

1056
01:22:01.88 --> 01:22:05.88
I'd be hard pressed to find somebody that

1057
01:22:07.08 --> 01:22:11.40
Love's doing something so much that they do it all the time with no discipline whatsoever

1058
01:22:12.20 --> 01:22:15.88
Yeah, and and I think I agree with you there

1059
01:22:16.60 --> 01:22:21.40
But technically is that discipline though because you know take Michael Jordan a for example

1060
01:22:21.40 --> 01:22:27.32
That's not a good example. Well, I think the guitar examples good because if you really love doing it

1061
01:22:27.32 --> 01:22:32.04
And that's what you're doing. I'll tell you what takes discipline even if you enjoy it

1062
01:22:32.60 --> 01:22:36.84
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with that answer for now. So let's say you know when it any even more important answers

1063
01:22:36.84 --> 01:22:43.24
I don't think it matters. I don't think it matters either so I don't know because it's like it's because it kind of all to at the end of the game

1064
01:22:43.24 --> 01:22:49.32
It did you put in the hours of practice and did you get good at it? Okay? Did you get good at it? That's what it with the question first

1065
01:22:49.32 --> 01:22:51.32
Did you get good at this thing?

1066
01:22:51.32 --> 01:22:57.88
I'll tell you all the time pretty much with very few exceptions the way you get good at something is practice and then

1067
01:22:58.28 --> 01:22:59.24
You know

1068
01:22:59.24 --> 01:23:05.16
Usually since you can't do one thing all day every single day for you know 30 40 50 years

1069
01:23:05.88 --> 01:23:09.64
It's gonna take discipline meaning you're gonna have to do it even though you don't want to do it kind of thing

1070
01:23:10.76 --> 01:23:12.76
Which is part of what discipline

1071
01:23:13.48 --> 01:23:18.52
But what if that part of it doesn't isn't there because even like Michael Jordan. He's so good

1072
01:23:18.52 --> 01:23:22.52
And he's probably love basketball whatever, but there are there is of course days where he's like okay

1073
01:23:22.52 --> 01:23:25.72
I'd rather maybe be there. No, I'm gonna take this play

1074
01:23:25.72 --> 01:23:27.72
That's why it's not an example

1075
01:23:27.72 --> 01:23:29.72
But the real person

1076
01:23:29.72 --> 01:23:31.72
Because because you get a person

1077
01:23:32.20 --> 01:23:34.84
That loves something so much that it took them zero discipline

1078
01:23:35.32 --> 01:23:36.92
I don't think that's a realistic person

1079
01:23:36.92 --> 01:23:39.72
I think that anyone that does anything

1080
01:23:40.76 --> 01:23:46.20
It gets to a point where the only thing that drives him to do that extra percentage is discipline

1081
01:23:46.20 --> 01:23:52.52
So I guess I will stick with it. Yeah, so I guess the question if you want to kind of relate it to like a real person

1082
01:23:52.76 --> 01:23:58.12
So you know a person who again just like loves it right just loves what they do

1083
01:23:58.12 --> 01:24:01.48
Of course they're gonna have some discipline because they're gonna have some days that they don't love it or whatever

1084
01:24:02.92 --> 01:24:07.80
Like are they would you consider a discipline person in their in their field?

1085
01:24:08.52 --> 01:24:14.20
Yeah, but we've also talked about this before just people that are very disciplined in one field and completely undisciplined

1086
01:24:14.20 --> 01:24:21.000
Other fields. Yeah, so so it's kind of an indicator that that might not really be technically disciplined

1087
01:24:21.24 --> 01:24:24.60
Technically they got the practice again. I don't think it's hours

1088
01:24:25.48 --> 01:24:28.60
Do your work if you like it. That's great if you don't like it

1089
01:24:28.76 --> 01:24:33.16
Here's a pairs of indicator if you if you don't like doing it. Well, what are you doing it for?

1090
01:24:34.20 --> 01:24:35.72
If you don't even enjoy it

1091
01:24:35.72 --> 01:24:41.08
I mean the end right? Yeah, it needs to to the end or whatever means to an end

1092
01:24:41.08 --> 01:24:48.20
But if you're gonna dedicate level 12 to something that you don't even enjoy I think that's kind of problematic. I think you're right too

1093
01:24:49.80 --> 01:24:55.80
Next question when you realize that nothing will change in the leadership do you tap out and move on or

1094
01:24:55.96 --> 01:25:02.28
Continue trying to be a good leader to your crew who deserves it. That's definitely a question that

1095
01:25:04.68 --> 01:25:06.68
It requires a little bit more

1096
01:25:06.68 --> 01:25:13.08
Information to give a good answer to you know because what's the situation can you be is there an opportunity that you could become the leader longterm

1097
01:25:13.48 --> 01:25:19.96
Because that totally changes the outlook right if if you could if you could do a good job and step up and move them to a more senior leadership

1098
01:25:19.96 --> 01:25:24.92
Position where you could take even more turns or take even more care of the crew

1099
01:25:24.92 --> 01:25:27.96
Well, then that's a positive thing and it might be worth hanging out for

1100
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.60
also

1101
01:25:30.60 --> 01:25:33.72
Is it a complete dead end like is there no possibility

1102
01:25:33.72 --> 01:25:40.36
It's a family owned business and all the senior leadership is related to the family and you're not part of the family and you're never have a chance

1103
01:25:40.92 --> 01:25:44.84
That that changes the prospect. I mean obviously that's like okay, well, maybe it's not worth taking another

1104
01:25:45.64 --> 01:25:53.88
If you leave can you leave where you can give open the opportunity for other people to go where you're going right which is not a good thing in terms of

1105
01:25:54.84 --> 01:25:56.84
You know

1106
01:25:56.84 --> 01:25:59.80
You're not being very loyal. You're being anti loyal. You're being

1107
01:25:59.80 --> 01:26:07.72
Unloil disloil if you do that but if the leadership that you're working for isn't taking care of the people

1108
01:26:08.52 --> 01:26:13.000
Then you you have to have some loyalty to the people you work with so there's that

1109
01:26:14.36 --> 01:26:16.36
I think that

1110
01:26:16.60 --> 01:26:20.44
You you you have to assess everything that's going on in the situation which which is not

1111
01:26:20.92 --> 01:26:26.36
Evident in this one quick question. I would say this to like don't blind side your boss

1112
01:26:26.36 --> 01:26:30.28
Right, that's something that if you're gonna leave leave on good terms

1113
01:26:30.84 --> 01:26:35.000
Explain to what's going on also that can be an opportunity to start a conversation about how the leadership could

1114
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.28
Implude prove a lot of times people don't want to change anything until it really

1115
01:26:38.28 --> 01:26:44.12
Smacks him in the face and one of the things that smacks him in the face is when one of their good people comes in and says hey look

1116
01:26:44.12 --> 01:26:47.96
I I'm gonna leave because of these reasons and again you don't

1117
01:26:48.92 --> 01:26:55.40
On the exit interview or on those conversations you don't just drop dime and make everyone make it out to be this horrible situation

1118
01:26:55.40 --> 01:27:00.92
It's a here some things that I've noticed here some things that I would want to change here's the direction that I see the company going

1119
01:27:00.92 --> 01:27:06.12
And this is the direction I think it should be going and for these reasons I've decided I'm gonna go try you know trying my hand somewhere else

1120
01:27:07.40 --> 01:27:12.04
I think if you'd be open like that it can start some good conversations and possibly you could make some progress

1121
01:27:13.16 --> 01:27:14.12
Or

1122
01:27:14.12 --> 01:27:20.84
Possibly you could confirm your suspicions which are no one wants to change no one wants to do anything different and if that's the case

1123
01:27:20.84 --> 01:27:24.60
And you realize it's dead end for you. Yeah, you gotta take that option

1124
01:27:26.28 --> 01:27:31.64
You can't beat your head against the on the 40 you know you can beat your head against the wall 47 times on the 48

1125
01:27:31.64 --> 01:27:36.12
Time it's like okay, I need to do something different. So pay attention to that

1126
01:27:40.44 --> 01:27:42.44
Next wish

1127
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.64
What could we all learn from tenacious D that most people overlook

1128
01:27:47.64 --> 01:27:49.64
You know

1129
01:27:49.64 --> 01:27:55.88
Create a cool question. It is a critical question, but there's actually a real a real legitimate answer that and that is that tenacious D who's a

1130
01:27:56.52 --> 01:27:57.56
a very

1131
01:27:57.56 --> 01:27:59.96
funny group of individuals

1132
01:28:01.40 --> 01:28:03.56
Jack Black is one of them who's a

1133
01:28:03.72 --> 01:28:08.68
musician and a comedian and an actor and Kyle gas is the other member

1134
01:28:09.80 --> 01:28:13.16
What's what's great about them is they don't take themselves too seriously and I think that's the lesson

1135
01:28:13.16 --> 01:28:17.56
The Lord is don't take yourself too seriously have some fun and

1136
01:28:19.96 --> 01:28:21.96
Don't take yourself too seriously, there it is yeah

1137
01:28:23.08 --> 01:28:25.80
And I would say there's difference between taking yourself

1138
01:28:25.80 --> 01:28:30.44
Seriously and being serious so you know how like

1139
01:28:32.60 --> 01:28:36.28
Being serious is like okay, you're not necessarily joking all the time

1140
01:28:37.64 --> 01:28:41.64
But taking yourself too seriously is like you know if like a joke is made about you

1141
01:28:41.64 --> 01:28:47.000
Or you can laugh at yourself for that kind of stuff. Yeah, sure so you can be serious all the time

1142
01:28:47.40 --> 01:28:53.48
You be a serious person and not take yourself too. That is true and that's a good that's fine

1143
01:28:53.88 --> 01:28:57.88
That's fine the person you don't want to be is the person that takes themselves too seriously all the time

1144
01:28:58.20 --> 01:29:01.88
Yeah, that's a problem so inversely I guess could you be too

1145
01:29:02.76 --> 01:29:07.72
Like could you be a very not serious person but take yourself too seriously?

1146
01:29:07.72 --> 01:29:13.48
Could you be a very serious? No, it's not so could you be a very like joking?

1147
01:29:13.48 --> 01:29:18.04
Not serious person. Yeah, for sure. And it's like that's the person that you can dish it out but you can't

1148
01:29:18.04 --> 01:29:24.76
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1149
01:29:25.40 --> 01:29:27.40
Let's see if let's see what you did there

1150
01:29:28.92 --> 01:29:35.56
Next question unless there's anything more from tenacious D no, you know maybe some good songs we can

1151
01:29:35.56 --> 01:29:45.32
In Sparado, right? That's from tenacious D that's right. I got to give a warning that language is not appropriate for kids with tenacious D and nor some of the subject matters

1152
01:29:45.32 --> 01:29:47.32
So be careful with that

1153
01:29:47.32 --> 01:29:52.76
The warning next question you mentioned you rarely pay play closed guard

1154
01:29:53.96 --> 01:29:57.56
Rarely is this just a personal preference

1155
01:29:58.28 --> 01:30:04.44
I would say that it is somewhat a personal preference right because there's definitely some people that

1156
01:30:04.44 --> 01:30:08.44
Intentionally play closed guard that's their game

1157
01:30:10.04 --> 01:30:15.40
But at the same time in order to attack even from the closed guard most the time you have to open your guard

1158
01:30:15.40 --> 01:30:20.28
So therefore your guard is open so open guard. Mm-hmm. That's kind of what I do

1159
01:30:21.48 --> 01:30:27.40
Skip the step of opening my guard, but you've been in people's guard that have really good close guards. Yes. Yeah, it's not fun

1160
01:30:27.40 --> 01:30:31.64
No, and that's why I try not to let people close their guard. Yeah, because

1161
01:30:31.64 --> 01:30:38.04
You know, you can prevent that from happening. Yeah, there's people that have really really solid psycho closed guard

1162
01:30:38.04 --> 01:30:40.76
So I'm not anti closed guard and some people are great at it

1163
01:30:42.28 --> 01:30:46.76
My personal preferences to play more open guard. Yeah

1164
01:30:47.88 --> 01:30:53.56
Yeah, it's one of those things where close guard if you're not a person who always plays closed guard or whatever it can be

1165
01:30:54.20 --> 01:30:58.84
Just something that you kind of use for specific situations, you know like if you're trying to maybe

1166
01:30:58.84 --> 01:31:00.84
Read

1167
01:31:00.84 --> 01:31:09.000
Regain some energy or something like that you want to rest a little bit or even in like a self defense like a striking scenario like a close guard

1168
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.36
My yeah, Mike no the closed guard is there's no doubt that closed guard has

1169
01:31:12.76 --> 01:31:17.96
Viable purpose and it's good and I do use it as I'll use it a lot

1170
01:31:18.36 --> 01:31:24.04
Yeah, and if you're a taller lanky guy close guard. It might be a little bit short

1171
01:31:24.04 --> 01:31:30.04
Fat legs that you know, you know, close my close guard is like my toes are touching

1172
01:31:31.08 --> 01:31:36.76
If I think on the side of the person yeah, and actually where it stems from if you went to the root of it is it stems from

1173
01:31:37.08 --> 01:31:43.32
Footlocks so you close your guard when your guard opens your vulnerable and that there's a moment where you're vulnerable

1174
01:31:43.32 --> 01:31:45.72
And if you're training with guys that have really good full locks

1175
01:31:46.20 --> 01:31:51.72
That's not a good situation so that's where I started not closing my guard because it was always that transition period where

1176
01:31:51.72 --> 01:31:59.48
My feet were vulnerable so I just stop closing my guard and kept it open and move my fit feet towards me to get in a little bit safer

1177
01:32:02.68 --> 01:32:05.88
Next question. We got time for one more. Yes

1178
01:32:07.24 --> 01:32:10.28
Yo, Jaco what's the best way to include?

1179
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.40
Yo, Jaco what's the best way to increase ones confidence?

1180
01:32:17.40 --> 01:32:21.40
You want to increase

1181
01:32:23.24 --> 01:32:26.20
Your confidence. I'll tell you what I think

1182
01:32:27.32 --> 01:32:29.72
What you do if you want to increase your confidence is

1183
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
You do Jaco

1184
01:32:34.04 --> 01:32:36.04
You work out you get stronger

1185
01:32:36.68 --> 01:32:40.68
You read and you study and you learn and you get smarter

1186
01:32:40.68 --> 01:32:45.24
and and then you practice

1187
01:32:46.28 --> 01:32:48.28
Speaking and you practice

1188
01:32:48.52 --> 01:32:54.84
Speakings that you can become more articulate and then you practice some more and then you

1189
01:32:56.12 --> 01:32:58.12
Then you do hard things

1190
01:32:58.84 --> 01:33:00.84
Things that are challenging

1191
01:33:01.64 --> 01:33:05.24
Things that are tough and then you get tougher you don't quit

1192
01:33:05.24 --> 01:33:16.68
That's what you do and then you stand up straight with your with your head high and then you're chin up and you're chest out

1193
01:33:19.56 --> 01:33:21.56
And at the same time

1194
01:33:22.28 --> 01:33:24.28
You also stay humble

1195
01:33:25.88 --> 01:33:29.16
Because you don't know everything and there are people

1196
01:33:29.16 --> 01:33:39.24
That are better than you are at some things people that are smarter than you and they're stronger than you and faster and more athletic than you

1197
01:33:39.80 --> 01:33:43.88
And they have more money and they got better looks and they're funnier

1198
01:33:47.56 --> 01:33:49.56
But all that is okay

1199
01:33:51.24 --> 01:33:53.24
It's actually okay because

1200
01:33:53.72 --> 01:33:56.36
There are things that are more important

1201
01:33:56.36 --> 01:34:02.52
More important than being strong and smart and athletic

1202
01:34:03.16 --> 01:34:04.52
More important than all those things

1203
01:34:08.44 --> 01:34:10.44
Things like loyalty

1204
01:34:11.32 --> 01:34:13.32
honor

1205
01:34:14.44 --> 01:34:16.44
will

1206
01:34:18.20 --> 01:34:20.20
Things like courage

1207
01:34:20.20 --> 01:34:27.56
The courage to stand and the will to keep going

1208
01:34:32.92 --> 01:34:36.76

01:39:52.88 --> 01:39:59.60
Train because you're attitude changed. Yeah, you know you went from like oh yeah, and we've got more could it's good

1272
01:39:59.60 --> 01:40:00.48
blah blah blah blah

1273
01:40:00.48 --> 01:40:02.24
To when you were like hey

1274
01:40:03.28 --> 01:40:09.52
It's got a game changer. Yeah, you know it's it's so filling what is it like so filling

1275
01:40:10.64 --> 01:40:15.44
Feeling like like when you eat it you just feel completely on your drink it you feel

1276
01:40:16.56 --> 01:40:18.56
Seachy it

1277
01:40:18.56 --> 01:40:24.08
That's why you know you know the term meal replacement yeah, like only got a meal replacement

1278
01:40:24.64 --> 01:40:26.64
This isn't supposed to be

1279
01:40:27.04 --> 01:40:31.04
A meal replacement it's not supposed to be the intent was an okay replace

1280
01:40:31.36 --> 01:40:34.16
But what happens is if you have it like yesterday

1281
01:40:34.64 --> 01:40:41.92
I had one in the in the afternoon. I had a light launch which was crap. I had a crap launch crap like not

1282
01:40:41.92 --> 01:40:43.92
Not healthy not healthy

1283
01:40:43.92 --> 01:40:51.60
Little off the path so I was feeling like okay and then so in the a little later than that

1284
01:40:51.60 --> 01:40:56.88
I said you know I'm just gonna have some more great now to do reset the path and then I got home from

1285
01:40:56.88 --> 01:40:59.04
You jutsu last night six hours later

1286
01:40:59.20 --> 01:41:03.60
Didn't even barely eat anything for dinner because I was still full. Why is that?

1287
01:41:04.56 --> 01:41:06.88
Amen, it's um feeling

1288
01:41:07.84 --> 01:41:10.88
Yeah, I guess that's why it's five days

1289
01:41:10.88 --> 01:41:16.56
Satisfied you're a multiple front. Yeah, yeah plus it's like all I'd like to come come on you kind of knew that it was the mall

1290
01:41:16.56 --> 01:41:22.24
Can you relax solid you felt good about that you were satisfied about that that's probably a big you know factor

1291
01:41:22.40 --> 01:41:26.88
So it's not supposed to be a meal replacement but that's not what it was engineer

1292
01:41:26.88 --> 01:41:33.52
Yeah, it was an engineer for but it turns out that if you have it you won't be that hungry because you be so full yeah

1293
01:41:33.52 --> 01:41:41.92
Yes, too for milk. Yeah, so it's so it's so different we had to create a different word for it

1294
01:41:41.92 --> 01:41:47.36
Yeah, man that's gonna be in the Oxford English dictionary soon sure it will it'll be oh it'll be

1295
01:41:48.48 --> 01:41:51.92
They'll have to define it in the OED you know the OED is

1296
01:41:52.72 --> 01:41:58.96
Oxford English dictionary. Yeah, yeah, that's the real deal right there. That's the big one. Yeah, that's the

1297
01:41:58.96 --> 01:42:06.08
Big one that's the mother of all dictionaries must be must be it is yeah, there's no must be that dang and milk is gonna be in there

1298
01:42:06.08 --> 01:42:11.52
You say all right, we'll put it in there. I won't you have to petition for it because people are just gonna start

1299
01:42:11.84 --> 01:42:16.72
That's all it's just gonna be yeah, yeah, it's just gonna be how and really that's how words get in the dictionary

1300
01:42:16.72 --> 01:42:22.60
No, I know it's just so easy. Yeah, just keep using it and here's the good thing about that word not to go off on too much

1301
01:42:22.60 --> 01:42:29.72
A tangent but a will and I don't when doing it with this situation. Yeah, milk is an actual legitimate situation

1302
01:42:30.12 --> 01:42:36.52
Mulk it's milk, but it's not like the word e-regardless and you know, you're like misusing the word because they're not you know

1303
01:42:36.76 --> 01:42:41.76
Educated on that specific word the user regardless their friend uses their neighbor use it their whole

1304
01:42:41.76 --> 01:42:47.48
Meets are gonna get in there too. Oh, Pahana is a Hawaiian word. I know, but maybe we'll get it into the English dictionary

1305
01:42:47.48 --> 01:42:49.24
But it's not English because that's a thing

1306
01:42:49.24 --> 01:42:54.74
Know the the English dictionary is not filled with words that are only English the whole English language

1307
01:42:54.74 --> 01:42:57.24
Right up of other words got your console

1308
01:42:57.24 --> 01:43:03.88
I can get Pahana in there right and milk. Yeah, well petition we can't petition you don't petition to get him in there

1309
01:43:03.88 --> 01:43:10.28
You actually just use the words so like the word forte I wonder if that's my forte when people start trying to rip off milk

1310
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:16.36
It'll be like hey we use your ox me a copy of that right but it'll just be the they'll just be the way

1311
01:43:16.36 --> 01:43:18.36
Yeah, yeah instead of a new thing

1312
01:43:18.36 --> 01:43:23.48
Yeah, like I'm gonna you know first I'm gonna work out and then like I'm just gonna

1313
01:43:24.04 --> 01:43:27.24
Yeah, oh you picked me up some milk from the store

1314
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:36.04
People say well what kind of milk do you want right and then won't be just be talking about because it'd be nine different brands of milk

1315
01:43:36.84 --> 01:43:42.60
Okay, you're from the kind of the east way is New England East coasts that technically fairs it can say okay, so

1316
01:43:42.60 --> 01:43:50.76
Do you grow up in a place where they say coax or pop we call it soda. Okay, so yeah, we call this little to so I

1317
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.80
So okay, that's normal to me in you know as far as my experience goes and then there's pop

1318
01:43:56.52 --> 01:44:03.08
You've heard pop. Yeah, yeah pop that's like the Midwest okay. Oh, hi-o and then there's coke. Yeah. Yeah, like coke

1320
01:44:07.48 --> 01:44:17.24
You know what I had to do this uh when I was going to college I had to it they wanted us to get the words

1325
01:44:40.04 --> 01:44:42.04
And so I did this to her

01:47:52.36 --> 01:47:55.08
Hannah means like you do like you're doing

1371
01:47:55.08 --> 01:48:00.68
No, you're doing it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, if you say Hannah hope that means let's do it again

1372
01:48:00.68 --> 01:48:07.92
You know whatever it is or like if someone usually they say well a common place they say it is like if a band is playing and it's like a

1373
01:48:08.04 --> 01:48:11.08
Dope song and they killed it. They say Hannah home means like

1374
01:48:11.08 --> 01:48:15.12
They can't play it again. I remember yelling that when I was a kid or if you go

1375
01:48:16.96 --> 01:48:22.76
Or if you could do something fun and you guys are done you say your go buy this to your friends and you say what tomorrow

1376
01:48:22.76 --> 01:48:25.40
Hannah home means you and do that thing tomorrow

1377
01:48:25.96 --> 01:48:30.36
It's good again. Yeah, unless back to origin our company

1378
01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:34.34
Origin made a mech up by the way this stuff good stuff

1379
01:48:34.34 --> 01:48:44.62
Including geese for Gjitsu starting to jitsu ask ask me ask jockel whatever if you if you ask me or jockel what Gigi get here it is

1380
01:48:45.62 --> 01:48:47.06
on

1381
01:48:47.06 --> 01:48:50.46
Compromised not uncompromised no exception

1382
01:48:51.74 --> 01:48:53.74
No exception that I can take of anyway

1383
01:48:54.50 --> 01:48:58.98
You get an origin Gigi for many many reasons. I'm not gonna go into all of them

1384
01:48:58.98 --> 01:49:05.60
But they are made in America and they're made for jjitsu sounds weird right like a 40 minutes a jjitsu get it

1385
01:49:05.60 --> 01:49:07.60
Gits made for jjitsu yeah

1386
01:49:07.60 --> 01:49:16.10
Not as much as the origin geek. That's the thing you have a jjitsu guy who is an expert in textiles manufacturing

1387
01:49:16.98 --> 01:49:22.50
Something fashion I know I know but it's part of it and he's like you know what?

1388
01:49:22.50 --> 01:49:26.54
I'm gonna make a geek for jjitsu for doing jjitsu in

1389
01:49:26.54 --> 01:49:33.98
You know not just hey again, which is cool and you can use a rigiditsu. Let's make a bunch of blanks and whatever brands can buy them from us

1390
01:49:33.98 --> 01:49:38.06
And you know just kind of this thing and we'll ship into them in the US no, it's not that

1391
01:49:38.90 --> 01:49:42.30
Pete made jjitsu geese for jjitsu shape for jjitsu

1392
01:49:43.22 --> 01:49:48.52
Wove in for jjitsu. That's that's important part. Yeah, so when you put it on you do the jjitsu

1393
01:49:48.52 --> 01:49:51.54
Yeah, and when you put it in the dryer it actually dries

1394
01:49:51.98 --> 01:49:54.62
Yeah, which is even so this is totally different

1395
01:49:54.62 --> 01:49:59.86
So this gui these guis all of them perform when you do jjitsu and when you're not jjitsu

1396
01:50:00.06 --> 01:50:00.94
Yeah

1397
01:50:00.94 --> 01:50:07.58
Boom there it is and all made America didn't I mention that everything even the threads or made in America even the cotton is growing in America

1398
01:50:07.58 --> 01:50:12.64
No, yeah, most of us already know that but I'm gonna say it again because almost don't necessarily know that no, we do

1399
01:50:12.64 --> 01:50:16.58
It's pretty cool when you're putting on a gui and you know the people that actually

1400
01:50:17.06 --> 01:50:19.90
Made it yeah, that's what you did it yeah

1401
01:50:19.90 --> 01:50:26.68
Very supporting when you're when you know you're supporting the economic growth of this country

1402
01:50:27.98 --> 01:50:32.94
Yes, and at the same time you're getting the best possible gui you can get yeah

1403
01:50:32.94 --> 01:50:39.02
I'd say that's 100% positive. That's a win-win across the board and everyone's kind of in the game together

1404
01:50:39.02 --> 01:50:45.58
You have that additional like additional feeling situation. That's my opinion. That's my experience anyway

1405
01:50:45.58 --> 01:50:49.74
Also rashguards these are good rashguards by the way

1406
01:50:50.86 --> 01:50:57.18
While you're then getting good good rashguards. Is that just a matter of opinion? Okay, or do you mean not come look at the rashguards?

1407
01:50:58.06 --> 01:51:00.06
You'll like one

1408
01:51:00.06 --> 01:51:02.06
Get one of those boom

1409
01:51:03.18 --> 01:51:08.46
Also the immersion camp jjitsu immersion camp one of the best ways to learn anything

1410
01:51:09.02 --> 01:51:11.02

1411
01:51:11.02 --> 01:51:19.02

01:52:05.58 --> 01:52:07.58
I don't have any jjitsu at all

1425
01:52:27.26 --> 01:52:29.26
Yes, and the answer is affirmative

01:52:29.26 --> 01:52:33.42
middle the week when's day in between jjitsu sessions go to the factory

1427

1439
01:53:32.54 --> 01:53:37.52
You're getting them, but here's the same way. They ask you so that's a thing you just don't care if it's just in the game

1440
01:53:37.86 --> 01:53:41.26
Yeah, a little bit. You get different inspired for Boba Fett

1441
01:53:41.26 --> 01:53:46.28
Yes, see if there's a no one go, but here's a here's the thing on the honest like if I do have the same weight

1442
01:53:46.46 --> 01:53:49.42
Maybe I'll get one in one, you know, because I have double of everything

1443
01:53:50.22 --> 01:53:53.06

I know seems like a small deal, I know, but I just got some in their dope and they're kind of like

1451
01:54:26.84 --> 01:54:30.30
You know how like when you're going through the airport right you got to take off your shoes

1452
01:54:30.30 --> 01:54:33.66
Some of us some of us you know, I know I get it some people. They don't got to take off the shoes

1453
01:54:33.66 --> 01:54:36.62
But when you got to take off your shoes and you kind of have your socks one time

1454

Good way to support

1471
01:55:50.34 --> 01:55:52.34
People don't think that's a big deal it's a big deal

1472
01:55:53.18 --> 01:55:55.18
Just that small little action

1473
01:55:56.78 --> 01:56:00.30
There's a big reaction kind of like remember

1474
01:56:01.42 --> 01:56:03.90
Drop in a piece of sodium in water

1475
01:56:05.10 --> 01:56:08.46
People have been reminding me of that analogy recently

1476
01:56:08.46 --> 01:56:12.14
You know we haven't talked about it in a while you

1477
01:56:12.66 --> 01:56:18.58
Jumped piece of sodium in water it explodes huge small action by dropping a small little thing big reaction

1478
01:56:18.98 --> 01:56:19.98
So you

1479
01:56:19.98 --> 01:56:23.86
Fair enough there you go revisit that one anyway also

1480
01:56:24.14 --> 01:56:26.74
Subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already on iTunes

1482
01:56:36.26 --> 01:56:42.02
For the video version of this podcast it's something in what I call an important

1483
01:56:43.06 --> 01:56:51.94
The video version sure if you want to know what talk it looks like if you don't know or you want to know what I look like if you want to know what the guests look like

1484
01:56:52.50 --> 01:56:54.50
Because that I think

1485
01:56:55.14 --> 01:57:02.46
Is gonna peak your curiosity more so does my opinion anyway point there is video version of the podcast also excerpts on there will put on there

1486
01:57:02.46 --> 01:57:09.58
You know for you know you want to share some lessons that jocco talks about with your friends online email the tool whatever

1487
01:57:09.70 --> 01:57:15.94
Facebook whatever and you know they're more likely listen to a little excerpt then maybe a three-hour podcast on something

1488
01:57:15.94 --> 01:57:21.66
And sit through that one lesson you wanted them to learn you see them saying you know a YouTube subscribe if you want

1489
01:57:22.02 --> 01:57:25.02
Good way to support also jocco as a story it's called jocco store

1490
01:57:25.02 --> 01:57:28.66
This is where you can get the shirts the very shirt the jocco is wearing right now

1491
01:57:28.66 --> 01:57:34.10
You could have that exact shirt if you were if that even means anything to you

1492
01:57:34.30 --> 01:57:41.38
But I think the shirts are cool discipline equal freedom get after you know you want to represent in your part of the world in the field in the wild

1493
01:57:41.86 --> 01:57:46.34
That's the weekend jocco store.com this wind stuff on there as well and patches

1494
01:57:47.14 --> 01:57:52.42
hats two can hats truckers and flex fit. They're good. They came on good. I think

1495
01:57:53.62 --> 01:57:57.22
So go on there. Let me know what you think think they're good get something

1496
01:57:57.22 --> 01:58:01.98
If you don't think they're good. Let me know how I can improve a weekend improve collectively

1497
01:58:02.46 --> 01:58:04.74
The hat situations people are very vocal

1498
01:58:05.50 --> 01:58:08.50
We invite them to be vocal if they think of a

1499
01:58:09.74 --> 01:58:15.06
Product or a shirt design or something and I encourage that

1500
01:58:16.18 --> 01:58:24.06
Also rashcards on their good cool rashcards 19% increase in performance what we used to preach you know what I'm not going to continue preaching that also

1501
01:58:24.06 --> 01:58:28.54
Psychological warfare. I'll tell you what this is if you don't know

1502
01:58:29.02 --> 01:58:36.32
It's an album with tracks of jocco on there each track not singing he's saying stuff and there's what he's saying if you're having okay

1503
01:58:36.32 --> 01:58:41.94
If you're having we a moment of weakness on your kind of pursuit your campaign against weakness

1504
01:58:43.94 --> 01:58:50.62
You haven't tried but wake up waking up in the morning every once in a while or you're you're feeling you don't feel like working out

1505
01:58:50.62 --> 01:58:53.90
I know who you know that if you don't feel like working out you still work out

1506
01:58:56.02 --> 01:59:01.68
That's the deal you still work out even you don't but everyone's about you really don't feel like doing it or

1507
01:59:02.38 --> 01:59:06.34
You're so caught up in this other thing and you kind of play games with your mind

1508
01:59:06.34 --> 01:59:12.54
You're like you know what I could skip the workout and it's justified literally justified because I would get this other work done

1509
01:59:12.54 --> 01:59:14.54
Then I'm working on right now

1510
01:59:14.54 --> 01:59:15.90
That's another one

1511
01:59:15.90 --> 01:59:22.02
But you listen to this jocco jocco will tell you this track when we think one of the tracks on the album you listen to it

The path to getting stronger smarter faster and better and if you don't believe me if you don't believe me

1531
02:01:13.86 --> 02:01:23.50
You can go to Irish Oaks Ranch dot com and get some soap made by warrior kid Aden he started his own business. I got some still it's good to go

1532
02:01:23.50 --> 02:01:29.92
He gets it from goat milk. Yeah, let me add that so the again

1533
02:01:29.92 --> 02:01:35.22
I said this before it's important to understand to it with you know how you get like the year neighbor

1534
02:01:35.22 --> 02:01:37.98
Whatever they make their little designer soap

1535
02:01:37.98 --> 02:01:45.54
Maybe they looked it up on YouTube or how to make it or whatever they put their perfumes in they wrap it up in nice little net wrapping with a little ribbon

1536
02:01:45.54 --> 02:01:47.54
It's cool. I dig it I dig it

1537
02:01:47.54 --> 02:01:54.74
But you don't really ease that soap, you know, it's like all right. I'm not gonna use all of them. Thanks. You know, I got a soap decorative piece

1538
02:01:54.74 --> 02:01:57.14
Whatever it's not that kind of soap

1539
02:01:57.14 --> 02:02:03.50
Oh, it's legit so you go use soap. I didn't even think to say that because I thought everyone knew I

1540
02:02:03.50 --> 02:02:05.98
Got no people get suspect because he's young kid

1541
02:02:06.54 --> 02:02:16.18
Maybe or you just hear like oh special soap. I don't then depend on your experience. I'm sure people don't give you decorative soap items. No, they don't regularly

1542
02:02:16.18 --> 02:02:23.26
No, okay, but good thing about this soap from my opinion. It's all about function and this soap will help you stay clean

1543
02:02:24.94 --> 02:02:29.46
The discipline equals freedom field manual you can give the gift of discipline

1544
02:02:29.78 --> 02:02:33.18
You know if you know someone that's like sort of maybe got to foot off the path

1545
02:02:33.82 --> 02:02:39.22
That's a person that's right before you this political freedom field manual. Yeah, that's a person that you go. Hey, man
