[00:00:00] This is Jockelpawncast number 302.
[00:00:04] With echo-trolls and me, Jockel-Willink.
[00:00:06] Good evening, echo-good evening.
[00:00:09] Sir, we have a tick.
[00:00:13] As I quickly walk across our tactical operation center to the radio operator, I'm sure my heart
[00:00:19] rate spiked.
[00:00:21] A tick pronounced tick stands for troops in contact.
[00:00:27] It is something arresting everyone's attention because it meant one of our patrols was
[00:00:32] taking enemy fire on the mean streets of Ramadi.
[00:00:36] As I press the handset of the radio to my ear, I could hear a sense of urgency in the voice
[00:00:42] the patrol leader on the ground.
[00:00:45] He was leading a group of soldiers on a dismounted patrol on Ramadi's southwestern
[00:00:50] side of town.
[00:00:52] Things could get kind of sporty there.
[00:00:55] The young sergeant leading the patrol was requesting I direct super-cober gunship helicopters
[00:01:00] to fire at insurgents on top of a building.
[00:01:05] They were engaged by insurgents with small arms from behind a building, but now he could
[00:01:10] see guns and other weapons on the roof.
[00:01:13] The insurgent had ceased for the moment, but the patrol leader was concerned about what
[00:01:18] might come next.
[00:01:22] Something did not feel right.
[00:01:24] It probably required a little more attention.
[00:01:27] I found the more experienced one gains, the more gut-feeling factors into decision-making.
[00:01:34] If something does not feel right, it probably requires a little more attention.
[00:01:41] I used a steady voice to calm the patrol leader down.
[00:01:45] I let him know I would call in the cobras, but first I needed him to provide positive
[00:01:50] identification of exactly who was on top of that building.
[00:01:56] My intuition was telling me to let the situation develop before calling in heavy fire
[00:02:01] power.
[00:02:03] After a few minutes, the patrol leader made a positive identification of the force on the
[00:02:08] rooftop.
[00:02:11] I was glad I did not pull the trigger on the cobras.
[00:02:15] A US Marine Corps civil affairs team were on the top of the building.
[00:02:22] A stressful situation was averted.
[00:02:24] Comeness and coolness prevailed.
[00:02:28] As it turned out, the small arms fire he received was some harassment fire and the insurgents
[00:02:33] who initiated the incident had quickly disappeared.
[00:02:41] So that right there is an excerpt from a book called Iron Sharpend Leadership, which was
[00:02:48] written by General John Gronsky who served in the US Army and the National Guard for over
[00:02:55] 40 years.
[00:02:57] I have the honor of serving with him during the Battle of Ramadi.
[00:03:00] We are deployments overlapped by about a month or so in the spring of 2006.
[00:03:08] He has been on the podcast before, episode 235.
[00:03:12] If you haven't listened to that podcast yet, stop and go and listen to that one to get
[00:03:17] some background on General Gronsky.
[00:03:20] We are honored to have General Gronsky back again tonight to discuss his new book, which
[00:03:27] as I said is called Iron Sharpend Leadership and the subtitle is transforming hard-fought
[00:03:33] lessons into action.
[00:03:36] General Gronsky.
[00:03:37] That's again.
[00:03:38] Thank you for coming by.
[00:03:39] Hey, Jako, it's great to be with you.
[00:03:41] Thanks for inviting me.
[00:03:42] Always good to be here in San Diego.
[00:03:44] San Diego is not a bad place to be.
[00:03:48] So your first book that we touched upon on the last podcast, it was called The Ride of Our
[00:03:53] Lives and it was about a bike ride that you made across America with your wife and your infant
[00:04:02] child and you talked about some of the lessons that you learned along that voyage and the
[00:04:09] experience you had, but that was very early in your Army career and this is reflective
[00:04:16] of your entire Army career.
[00:04:18] So what made you decide to write this book, Iron Sharpend Leadership?
[00:04:21] Yeah, you know, Jako and I wrote that book the Ride of Our Lives near the end of the
[00:04:27] book, I put some just leadership lessons that I gained on that ride as you mentioned.
[00:04:35] And I actually had people asking me to expand on those lessons and the book focused
[00:04:42] just on that very short period of time, three months in 1983.
[00:04:47] And I just gained so much more experience and learned so many more lessons over the
[00:04:54] next 30 plus years.
[00:04:57] And I just felt compelled to put those lessons down in the writing and hopefully would
[00:05:03] help other people gain from really most of the mistakes I made along the way.
[00:05:08] Had you written the Ride of Our Lives in close proximity when it actually took place or
[00:05:14] was that?
[00:05:15] Did you remember back 30 years or whatever it was?
[00:05:18] Yeah, you know, Jako and I took that bike ride with my wife and 15 month old son
[00:05:24] back in 1983.
[00:05:25] I kept the journal.
[00:05:26] Got it.
[00:05:27] That journals sat in a shoe box for over 35 years.
[00:05:32] And then when I retired from the army in 2019, had a little bit of time on my hand.
[00:05:37] So I decided to write the book the Ride of Our Lives.
[00:05:40] And it was really meant to be for myself to reflect back on and for my family to have.
[00:05:48] And then I decided to self-publish it as a book and it turned out to be quite popular.
[00:05:55] Awesome.
[00:05:56] So this book, like you said, this is going back on your whole career and the lessons
[00:06:00] that you've learned and you've been through the entire leadership spectrum in the army
[00:06:06] and spent a bunch of time in combat.
[00:06:09] And so this is a great book and let's jump into it.
[00:06:13] So and just so everybody knows, look, if I have to skip around I'm not going to read the
[00:06:18] whole book right now, there is an audio book version of this as well, but we're not going
[00:06:22] to read the whole thing.
[00:06:23] So I'm going to jump into some spots.
[00:06:25] It's obviously not going to be completely cohesive when we read it on the podcast.
[00:06:29] It's set up in a very cohesive manner in the way it's read.
[00:06:32] But I got to make that caveat before I start reading.
[00:06:36] But here's the one I want to start with.
[00:06:38] Going to the book.
[00:06:39] The last leadership advice was given to me by a crusty non-commissioned officer during my
[00:06:44] first experience in the army when I was training as an ROTC cadet at Fort Knox, Kentucky
[00:06:50] in 1976.
[00:06:52] I was a patrol leader during a training event.
[00:06:55] In the scenario, my patrol was passing through a cleared lane within a minefield.
[00:06:59] The lane was about 40 yards in length.
[00:07:02] As we began, as we were crossing the minefield on the cleared lane, we began to receive
[00:07:08] small arms fire from an enemy position about 200 yards away.
[00:07:13] I hesitated.
[00:07:15] The soldiers were waiting for a command I did not give.
[00:07:19] It took less than a minute for the enemy to destroy my entire patrol.
[00:07:23] The sergeant who was a seasoned Vietnam veteran pulled me aside and loudly advised
[00:07:30] when in charge, be in charge.
[00:07:34] The followers expect you to lead so you better damn well lead.
[00:07:41] Good lesson learned out of the gate.
[00:07:42] Yeah.
[00:07:43] Again, I could just say as I reflect back on my career, it was those non-commissioned officers,
[00:07:51] especially early on in my career, those Vietnam vets, who I was fortunate to be around and
[00:07:57] fortunate to get just some hard advice from.
[00:08:01] So punches pulled, this is the way it should be.
[00:08:05] So square yourself away and lead when you're in a leadership position.
[00:08:10] Yeah, you know what's thinking?
[00:08:11] In that particular case, and when I was running training, a lot of times the younger guys,
[00:08:17] the young seal officers, one thing that would happen to them would be, there would be
[00:08:23] a platoon chief for a leading petty officer that would get in the habit of making a lot
[00:08:28] of the calls.
[00:08:30] And so the officer would get in the habit of not making calls.
[00:08:35] And it was a, it wasn't even a fine line.
[00:08:38] What they had to realize was if one of the NCOs makes a call, awesome, you support their
[00:08:44] call, you're going to go, no factor, all good.
[00:08:48] It's in those moments, those rare moments where, you know, in this particular case, maybe
[00:08:52] the NCO got hit with the first volley of fire or the NCO wasn't a position on the mine
[00:08:57] field where he could see where the fire was coming from.
[00:08:59] So they can't make a call or they're panicked or whatever the case may be.
[00:09:04] So you get that leadership vacuum.
[00:09:07] And that's when that officer has to be detached enough has to be heads up enough to go
[00:09:12] away to second.
[00:09:13] My NCOs aren't making a call.
[00:09:15] I need to lead right now.
[00:09:17] So it's a little bit of a cautionary tale too.
[00:09:20] You know, if when you're in charge, it doesn't necessarily mean you need to make the call,
[00:09:26] but you better be prepared in case, you know, the people, the your support in leadership
[00:09:30] doesn't make something happen.
[00:09:31] And in an ideal world, support in leadership makes call, you don't have to do anything.
[00:09:35] I hate to say it, but in an ideal world when you're in charge, you don't have to do anything.
[00:09:40] Yeah, ideally.
[00:09:42] And you know, Jock, you speak to the fact that, you know, you have to put your followers
[00:09:49] into positions where they have that opportunity to make some of those tough calls.
[00:09:53] Now, I even think of this reflecting back, you know, my kids are both in their 30s now,
[00:09:58] but reflecting back when when my children were teenagers.
[00:10:04] And I really think it's important for parents to let young teenagers make decisions.
[00:10:09] Because if parents are making all the decisions for their kids, when are they going to
[00:10:13] learn how to make a decision?
[00:10:15] You know, they're going to learn how to make a decision when they become an adult.
[00:10:18] But that's kind of too late.
[00:10:20] So I do think you need to put your followers in positions where they gain that experience
[00:10:25] say.
[00:10:26] And if they make a mistake, you know, that's usually how we learn more is when we make
[00:10:30] a mistake when then when we do something right by accident.
[00:10:34] Yeah, that's, I was going to say when you were saying, let your kids make decisions, let
[00:10:39] your kids make mistakes too.
[00:10:41] And just like in the military, this doesn't mean you're going to send a young, you know,
[00:10:46] they're going to get the first lieutenant out on an operation that they're not capable of conducting
[00:10:50] because they don't have the experience yet.
[00:10:51] They don't have the knowledge.
[00:10:52] You're not going to say, oh, let's see how it goes.
[00:10:54] No, you're not going to do that.
[00:10:55] Just like you're not going to say, oh, my kid wants to go play in the street, which is not
[00:10:58] a good decision where they could get hit by a card.
[00:11:00] And that's not what we're talking about.
[00:11:02] But you can certainly let them make decisions and let them brush up against the guard rails
[00:11:07] of failure.
[00:11:08] Because that's where you learn through those little scratches that you get on the body.
[00:11:12] Exactly.
[00:11:13] I'm going to fast forward a little bit.
[00:11:17] Because this section kind of sets up the rest of the book.
[00:11:19] My personal leadership philosophy is based on three elements of character, competence,
[00:11:24] and resilience.
[00:11:26] There are sub-components to each element of my leadership philosophy.
[00:11:31] Character, competence, resilience, and their sub-components are skills.
[00:11:35] And like any other skill, they can be learned in strength and although some may be born
[00:11:40] with higher levels of any one of these elements, everyone can improve them through training
[00:11:46] and practice.
[00:11:49] And this is something that I think there's a lot of people in the world that think that
[00:11:56] leadership is something you're born with.
[00:11:59] Any of the you have it or you don't.
[00:12:00] And like you said, there are certainly, you might have some advantages in some areas.
[00:12:05] You might be pretty articulate.
[00:12:07] You might be pretty visionary.
[00:12:10] You might be have a good sense of other people's emotions.
[00:12:15] There's different levels that people have in all those categories.
[00:12:20] But no matter where you are in all these categories, you can improve upon them.
[00:12:25] Then you can get better.
[00:12:26] And I think a lot of people think, oh, leadership is just going to come through osmosis or
[00:12:32] something you're born with.
[00:12:33] And there's nothing you can do to actually train it.
[00:12:35] And the fact of the matter is there's 100% things that you can do to improve your leadership
[00:12:39] skills.
[00:12:40] Yeah.
[00:12:41] And I think it's like athleticism.
[00:12:44] Some people are born with better athletic skills than others.
[00:12:50] But everybody could improve in that athleticism.
[00:12:52] It doesn't mean everybody's going to be an NFL player or NBA player or whatever.
[00:12:58] But everybody could get better.
[00:12:59] And I feel the same way about leadership.
[00:13:02] And that's another reason why I wrote the book and just as you've written many leadership
[00:13:06] books to try to help people develop those skills that we know could be improved.
[00:13:12] Yeah.
[00:13:13] And that's the benefit of being in the military as you get to see over and over again,
[00:13:17] young leaders actually improve and get better and make better decisions and get more
[00:13:24] experience.
[00:13:25] So it's something that you and I through the blessing of being in the military got to see
[00:13:28] over and over again, it's fact, it's a fact that you know leaders can be improved.
[00:13:34] Let me get into these components here.
[00:13:37] The first one character, character is the root of leadership.
[00:13:40] A leader of character will be able to establish an environment of trust.
[00:13:44] A character based leader grows trust by trusting others first, providing a vision, displaying
[00:13:50] integrity, leading by example, and sincerely caring about others.
[00:13:55] The leader must have values and principles.
[00:13:58] Values are something a person believes in and will be guided by when times are good and
[00:14:03] when times are tough.
[00:14:05] A character based leader sincerely cares about those they lead and they place the interests
[00:14:10] of their followers above their own.
[00:14:16] The key component.
[00:14:18] I had a guy on this podcast by the name of General James Muka Yamma and he was, he served
[00:14:27] in Vietnam and he worked for Colonel David Hackworth when Hackworth was the Battalion Commander.
[00:14:35] Muka Yamma was one of his company commanders, but that was a point that he made so clear
[00:14:40] was that idea of you got to care about your people and that was a thing that Hackworth had.
[00:14:45] I don't know if it always comes across in his books and in writings, but Hackworth just
[00:14:52] cared about his soldiers and that elevated him so much and their eyes.
[00:14:56] That's exactly what you're talking about here.
[00:14:59] It's easy to say.
[00:15:03] Care about your people that you lead, but I think extremely hard to do.
[00:15:09] To put the interest of those you lead before your own interest.
[00:15:13] I think the only people who could naturally do that are parents.
[00:15:18] I think parents could naturally put the interest of their kids before their own.
[00:15:24] To do that to people that are blood relatives of yours.
[00:15:30] That's a hard thing to do and I've been fortunate enough to be around leaders in the
[00:15:37] military who had that ability to do that.
[00:15:40] There's almost an innate sense they had to put the welfare of those they lead first.
[00:15:47] We learn this in the army and the Marines and the Navy, Air Force that leaders eat
[00:15:54] last.
[00:15:55] The reason we do that, you're going to imagine, you're out there either in a training
[00:15:59] environment or on operation, you get this child mermaided out to you in the field.
[00:16:06] So a journey, it's cold and if that leader jumps into child line first, it's probably
[00:16:11] whoever's going to be the last guy into child line, probably isn't going to eat or at least
[00:16:15] get a full portion.
[00:16:16] That's why leaders eat last.
[00:16:18] You want your folks that you lead to have the benefit of that nutrition before you suck
[00:16:25] it down.
[00:16:27] We learn this in the military and I think folks in the civilian sector, some know that
[00:16:35] kind of innately and others maybe never experience that and that's why I think there's
[00:16:41] some organizations that cannot develop that trust that is so essential if you're going
[00:16:48] to have an organization effectively run.
[00:16:54] Another thing about this is I think there's people who think that they can fool their troops
[00:17:03] and their subordinate leadership into thinking that they care about them and I promise
[00:17:10] you having been a young and listed guy, having been the youngest and most junior guy in my
[00:17:16] first two silptuans, everybody can tell when you're looking out for yourself, everybody
[00:17:23] can tell, you're not fooling anyone and that's why the people that truly care about the
[00:17:28] team and put the team above themselves, that's why they wish I had.
[00:17:33] You think of examples that we've seen in the military, a leader who I remember when I was
[00:17:40] over in Ramadi, one of the platoon was getting some better version of an uparmer come
[00:17:46] V and the platoon leader refused to take that better version.
[00:17:50] He made sure this other soldiers in the platoon got that version before he would take it
[00:17:57] to write in himself and that's putting yourself more at risk for the benefit of those
[00:18:02] your leads.
[00:18:03] There's a perfect example of how one could do that, especially if it means putting your
[00:18:08] life at risk, this guy was a true leader.
[00:18:11] 100% no that's an outstanding example right there.
[00:18:17] Next thing, next character is to competence.
[00:18:20] When I talk about competence being an element of leadership, I am not referring to the
[00:18:23] tactical competence in a specific job, I am referring to the general competence of a person
[00:18:29] to lead others.
[00:18:30] Many elements make up competence, but the most imperative are providing a vision and purpose
[00:18:36] for the organization, decision making, developing others and communication.
[00:18:41] A leader must be able to articulate a vision which is simple, unique, ideal image of the future.
[00:18:48] Leaders must explain the why behind the vision and tell the followers what they believe
[00:18:52] in.
[00:18:54] When leaders provide vision and purpose, they instill confidence and provide inspiration
[00:18:58] that fuels an organization and powering it to success.
[00:19:02] A leader must learn and apply problem-solving skills and decision-making processes.
[00:19:07] A leader also must possess the courage to decide.
[00:19:11] One of the most important roles of a leader is to develop other leaders.
[00:19:15] A leader must mentor and coach must be a mentor and coach willing to take others assigned
[00:19:20] and provide insight into what it means to be a leader.
[00:19:23] A leader must communicate in clear, concise and respectful manner.
[00:19:27] Most leaders spend between 70 and 90% of their time communicating.
[00:19:31] It is important for a leader to develop listening skills and the ability to get a consistent
[00:19:36] message out to all stakeholders.
[00:19:40] So that's the competency of being a leader, all these skills that you list in here.
[00:19:45] But again, what's interesting about these skills is, if you scan through them, can you
[00:19:51] get better at explaining the vision?
[00:19:55] Yes, you can.
[00:19:56] Can you get better at decision-making?
[00:19:58] Yes, you can.
[00:19:59] Can you get better at problem-solving?
[00:20:00] Yes, you can.
[00:20:01] Can you get better at decision-making?
[00:20:02] Yes, you can.
[00:20:03] Can you get better at mentoring?
[00:20:04] Yes, you can.
[00:20:05] Every one of these can.
[00:20:06] You get better at communicating in simple, clear, concise language, respectful manner.
[00:20:11] Yes, you can.
[00:20:12] And you're talking about here with the competence of a leader is something that you can
[00:20:18] improve upon.
[00:20:19] Yeah.
[00:20:20] And the book is people go through it.
[00:20:23] They'll see there's stories associated with these lessons that I've learned.
[00:20:30] And then there's certain actions I've found through my experience over the last 40 years
[00:20:35] that help one get better and stronger at these particular skills that you mentioned.
[00:20:41] Yeah, so just to make that clear, because I don't know how much I did it my notes, but you
[00:20:45] broke the book down almost like a military learning manual where, hey, here's the actions
[00:20:50] that you need to take if you want to improve in these areas.
[00:20:52] And I know I don't hate them.
[00:20:53] I think I hate a couple of them, but that's what that's the way the book is broken down.
[00:20:59] The last thing is resilience.
[00:21:04] Anyone who has ever led anything will tell you that at some point in time the organization
[00:21:07] you lead will face adversity.
[00:21:09] So that may matter every living person faces adversity at some point in their lives.
[00:21:14] It all comes down to how prepared one is to face these challenges and how one responds.
[00:21:22] Leaders must prepare themselves and give their followers and their followers to overcome
[00:21:26] challenges.
[00:21:27] Positive energy is essential when leading a large organization or a small team.
[00:21:32] Optimism and enthusiasm are two key traits of a resilient person.
[00:21:36] Like any other trait, they must be exercised to become a strong part of one's makeup.
[00:21:42] A leader must be physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually fit.
[00:21:46] To strengthen resilience, leaders must follow themselves, must allow themselves to be vulnerable
[00:21:52] by moving out of their comfort zone, by taking risks and taking on tough challenges, scar tissue
[00:21:58] is developed and resilience is improved.
[00:22:02] So the person that's going to lead had better be able to get back up again if they get knocked
[00:22:08] out.
[00:22:09] And you know, Jaco, I think resilience is something that has been talked about a lot over
[00:22:14] the last few years.
[00:22:17] But resilience, I don't believe resilience actually just happens by itself.
[00:22:23] You've got to train to become a resilient person by doing certain things that you just
[00:22:29] mentioned, you know, moving out of your comfort zone.
[00:22:33] I mean, if you're a leader or a person who just wants to take the easy way of just staying
[00:22:41] in your comfort zone, doing things that you know how to do, never stretching yourself, never
[00:22:46] putting yourself in a position where you might make a mistake because you think you're
[00:22:50] going to look bad in front of your followers or your peers or whoever.
[00:22:54] You're not going to grow that way.
[00:22:56] And then when tough times do happen, you're going to be less likely to demonstrate the
[00:23:03] resiliency that's needed in order to help your organization get through those tough times.
[00:23:09] Reminds me talking to some of the tankers.
[00:23:13] Actually, this was the one, one AD that replaced you guys and Ramadi.
[00:23:17] But one thing that I found interesting was that they do, and it was actually a guy named
[00:23:22] Mike Bima who was the company commander, fantastic guy.
[00:23:26] But he was explaining to me what they do to prepare for deployment, what do they do things
[00:23:30] that they do to prepare for deployment is they bring their tank on this tank range, and
[00:23:34] they do gunnery where you're shooting and you're moving and maneuvering the tank and doing
[00:23:38] comms and reloading.
[00:23:40] And it's a challenge.
[00:23:42] It's like a, I guess for an infantry guy or for a seal, it's like doing a combat conditioning
[00:23:48] course where you run, you shoot, you got head plates, you got long distance shot to take,
[00:23:52] you got to do pull ups and rope climbs, you got to shoot more.
[00:23:55] It's like that, but it's an tank.
[00:23:57] And one thing that he said to me was when they go do gunnery, the first person that goes
[00:24:02] is the tying commander.
[00:24:03] Exactly.
[00:24:04] That's the example, hey, this, I'm going first.
[00:24:06] And so what you're talking about getting out of your comfort zone, I can't imagine
[00:24:09] a lot of those tanker, those tank battalion commanders, they probably been out of the tank
[00:24:13] for a while.
[00:24:14] And yet they're going to step up and they're going to show, okay, this is it.
[00:24:16] This is what we do.
[00:24:17] Yeah.
[00:24:18] And, you know, you kind of reminded me of something that I wouldn't mind sharing with you
[00:24:24] because I think it's kind of a great lesson in resiliency.
[00:24:30] And this goes back to Ramadi.
[00:24:32] I had a national, you know, one of our national guard tank companies when we're training
[00:24:38] at Camp Shell, it'll be before going over to Iraq.
[00:24:44] This company has three platoons and one of their platoons went through that tank
[00:24:48] undery that you just talked about, only one of their platoons dead.
[00:24:53] And when they got over to Ramadi, we actually task organized them to two, six, nine armor,
[00:24:59] which was an Easter mighty combat outpost-corrigator area.
[00:25:03] And since two, six, nine armor was an armor battalion, they didn't need this company to
[00:25:10] operate in tanks, so they made them motorized infantry.
[00:25:13] So they operated as motorized infantry for the first, the first, six months, they're over
[00:25:18] in Ramadi, and then two, six, nine armor leaves, and they get replaced by first, at a
[00:25:23] 506 infantry from the 101st Airborne, light infantry.
[00:25:28] But tanks were still needed in Easter mighty.
[00:25:31] So now these national guard soldiers who were tankers, operating as motorized infantry
[00:25:37] for the previous six months, are now in tanks.
[00:25:41] And they just did a remarkable job, they had several main gun engagements while they were
[00:25:48] over there, and it just goes to show you how by training to be resilient and training
[00:25:56] in those skills.
[00:25:58] Even when you're taken out of that particular job in a combat situation for six months,
[00:26:03] and then having to go back into those tanks again, and then just performing remarkably,
[00:26:08] I think is just a great story of not only resiliency, but adaptability.
[00:26:15] I think that's something that has made the seal team successful, and it starts in the basic
[00:26:20] seal training.
[00:26:22] And I always say that, hey, you know, the basic seal training, you don't really learn anything,
[00:26:25] because you're just doing push ups and being wet, cold and miserable.
[00:26:27] You learn how to suffer, and if you don't like to suffer, you're not going to be there.
[00:26:31] But one thing I will say is, you're going to totally chaos.
[00:26:34] Well, it's total chaos when you're there.
[00:26:38] Everything that happens, I mean, you go out, you go out, your boats in the ocean, and they're
[00:26:42] getting flipped over, and you're getting washed up on, and people are confused, lost, you've
[00:26:46] got cam lights, bouncing all over the place.
[00:26:48] When hell week kicks off, there's just total chaos, confusion, there's throwing smoke grenades,
[00:26:53] everywhere, you can't see anything, there's machine guns going off, you can't hear anything.
[00:26:57] And it's just like that all the time.
[00:26:58] So you get used to this environment where there's total chaos going on, and you have to figure
[00:27:02] out you have to adapt.
[00:27:03] And then when I got to the Syltimes, and it's not so much like this anymore, but it still
[00:27:08] does have this, still does have this, this DNA, which is, there was no doctrine when I got
[00:27:16] the Syltimes.
[00:27:17] If you want to do a raid, if someone didn't tell you if your platoon chief didn't know how
[00:27:22] to do a raid, you had to just figure it out.
[00:27:24] And there's good and bad to that.
[00:27:25] I mean, it's kind of good in the army.
[00:27:27] You want to do a raid, you can pick up the, what is it?
[00:27:29] Seven taxics and triple tune and squad you can figure out how to do a raid.
[00:27:32] It tells everybody what they need to do.
[00:27:34] Syltimes doesn't have that.
[00:27:35] And so you just go, okay, well, what makes sense?
[00:27:37] How can we do this?
[00:27:39] And like I said, there's some good to that.
[00:27:41] There's some bad to that because now you might not come up with a best plan, but there's also
[00:27:45] some good because you're constantly learning to adapt.
[00:27:47] And I think that's one of the things, and it's, look, the whole, I'm, I'm saying that
[00:27:50] about the Syltimes because that's my environment.
[00:27:52] But the military in general does that, and that's exactly what you're talking about.
[00:27:55] You take guys, you train them in one aspect of combat.
[00:28:00] You take them on deployment, you put them into a totally different aspect of combat.
[00:28:03] They perform.
[00:28:05] And then halfway through you switch them back to the original thing and they get back
[00:28:07] on that horse and do it again.
[00:28:09] Or in this case, get back on those tanks.
[00:28:10] Yeah, I do it again.
[00:28:11] Yeah.
[00:28:12] And you know, I remember when we got over the brigade, I was part of, got over to Ramadi in 2005,
[00:28:22] coin doctrine wasn't written yet.
[00:28:25] And coin doctrine wasn't written by General Patreus in General Madison, until early 2006, really.
[00:28:34] And so there was no coin academy that, you know, leader, that leader from I brigade went
[00:28:40] to when we got to Iraq, but I think 2006, 2007, and after that, any brigade that got deployed
[00:28:48] Iraq went through this thing called the coin academy, the counter insurgency academy.
[00:28:54] And so we kind of had to figure it out on her own.
[00:28:57] And when you figure it out, you know, you read history.
[00:29:00] You see how it was done in the past.
[00:29:03] You just use some common sense.
[00:29:05] You talk to leaders that you respect and that you count on and you kind of figured out.
[00:29:12] And that was the interesting thing that was done there, you know, brigade of 5,000 soldiers
[00:29:16] and Marines.
[00:29:17] But a lot of the operations were occurring at the platoon and company level.
[00:29:23] So it's not like, you know, because I was a brigade commander, I was directing some type
[00:29:27] of large brigade operation that didn't exist.
[00:29:31] They were all done at very small unit levels.
[00:29:34] And just an amazing thing about our American, you know, servicemen and women.
[00:29:42] They figured out.
[00:29:43] They have a way to figure it out.
[00:29:44] And I think if you read history of the military, which I know you do when you read
[00:29:50] on your podcast regularly, it's just amazing how we have, you know, her American military
[00:29:58] has just figured things out as we went.
[00:30:01] Yeah, I don't even remember because the first, I arrived in the normal in April of 2006.
[00:30:11] I visited one of my friends who was an Intel officer at one of the bases.
[00:30:19] And in Ramadi and she had the big targeting board.
[00:30:24] And I had worked with her before.
[00:30:26] She had that big targeting board board when I was in Iraq before, the same big targeting
[00:30:30] board.
[00:30:31] I was like, man, this is, this is not a good sign because if we're just going to be targeting
[00:30:34] these people and this is, this board is just as big as it was when I left.
[00:30:38] Yeah.
[00:30:39] And I went back to my talk, my tackle operations center and I googled, I think I must have
[00:30:44] heard something about this new counterinsertancy manual.
[00:30:48] And I googled it and it was on, it was a draft copy because it didn't even get released
[00:30:51] yet.
[00:30:52] It was a draft copy that I got and I was just like, okay, this is it.
[00:30:55] And I found it on, I forget those websites, those, uh, there's a couple websites.
[00:31:00] I want to say one of them was like global security dot org.
[00:31:03] Maybe I found out, but it was on one of those websites that I used to read about what was
[00:31:07] happening in the world, sort of from a, from a military geopolitical perspective.
[00:31:13] Also as a bunch of manuals.
[00:31:14] So we had the new FM3 tech 24 counterinsertancy and I, I literally read it that like that
[00:31:21] night day, it's pretty long.
[00:31:23] And I just pluck things from it.
[00:31:25] Yeah.
[00:31:26] And realized, okay, this is what we need to do.
[00:31:28] And I remember, I, I know I, I stole from it because I remember my boss saying, you know,
[00:31:34] what's your objective in these types of operations and I said, provide security for the
[00:31:37] populace, which I know I didn't make that up on my own.
[00:31:40] I didn't come up with that.
[00:31:45] That's 100% stolen from from the counterinsertancy manual.
[00:31:46] And that's what, that's what kind of drove me in that direction of like, hey, how can
[00:31:50] we really help the broader conventional forces that are here as, as they start to move in
[00:31:57] and try and stabilize what's happening?
[00:31:59] Yeah, you know, it's, it's, it's funny you mentioned that because we, we kind of evolved
[00:32:04] and, and I read somewhere or somebody told me, you know, you can't kill yourself out of
[00:32:08] an insurgency.
[00:32:10] And we, when we first got there, you know, our mission was to, you know, kill them
[00:32:16] surgeons.
[00:32:17] And we evolved into protecting the populace because we realized, you know, the main, the main
[00:32:24] goal here is to protect the populace in order to change chaos into something that was
[00:32:32] going to become or than chaos there.
[00:32:35] And so the same type of thinking you had about, you know, your mission of protecting the,
[00:32:42] the people of Ramadi, we, we kind of evolved into that too from, again, reading history,
[00:32:50] talking to some of the Iraqi leaders in Ramadi that we would be dealing with on a regular
[00:32:56] basis.
[00:32:57] And, and we came to the conclusion that, hey, if we're going to be successful here, it's
[00:33:02] about protecting the populace, not not not simply killing the bad guys.
[00:33:06] Now, sometimes you would have to kill bad guys in order to protect the populace.
[00:33:10] So I'm not saying, you know, that was totally off the table.
[00:33:13] But the mindset completely changed for us throughout that one year that we conducted operations
[00:33:18] there.
[00:33:19] Yeah.
[00:33:20] Awesome stuff.
[00:33:23] Getting back to the book here.
[00:33:28] You say discipline, respect, and selflessness are part of the United States Army's DNA
[00:33:33] forged over 200 years ago during the training of the continental army at Valley Forge,
[00:33:38] Pennsylvania.
[00:33:39] You throwing Pennsylvania any chance you get.
[00:33:41] Can't don't you.
[00:33:42] I got to.
[00:33:43] Yeah.
[00:33:44] These traits have served our military well and account, at least in part, for the reason
[00:33:48] the United States military always tops polls announcing the most trusted organizations in
[00:33:52] America.
[00:33:53] Any leader would do well to demonstrate the traits of self discipline, respect for others,
[00:33:59] and selflessness in order to lead effectively.
[00:34:05] Now you got a story in here about, was it Sergeant Mike Kacher, Mike Kacher, tell us that
[00:34:11] story.
[00:34:12] Yeah.
[00:34:13] Mike is an amazing person.
[00:34:18] Mike Kacher was a soldier in the Pennsylvania National Guard 28th Infantry Division who was
[00:34:27] deployed to Afghanistan.
[00:34:30] While he was in Afghanistan, a rocket came in, this rocket landed about 10 feet away from him.
[00:34:39] It just caused significant wounds to Mike Kacher.
[00:34:43] Mike is jaw, internal bleeding and damages, and then his left arm was wounded so significantly
[00:34:54] that it had to be amputated.
[00:34:57] And they were treating him.
[00:34:59] He was eventually putting in a coma, and then induced coma, and it took him two years
[00:35:05] to recover from these very, very significant wounds that he had.
[00:35:11] And he had a lot of deal with, obviously, recovering from these wounds, losing his arm,
[00:35:18] et cetera, et cetera.
[00:35:20] And he decided that the way he was going to overcome this adversity that he was facing
[00:35:28] was to just build himself up physically and compete in physical competition.
[00:35:33] And so he decided to enter the Invictus Games.
[00:35:38] And then Invictus Games were created, I think, by Prince Harry, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:35:46] And it was all about bringing wounded warriors together to compete in Olympic style competition.
[00:35:53] And so I believe it was in 2018, and Sidney Australia, when Mike was competing in his
[00:35:58] third Invictus game, as he was competing in some track and field of vans.
[00:36:03] He noticed the shun girl about eight years old in the stands.
[00:36:08] And she was kind of shadowing him.
[00:36:11] Whatever event he would go to compete in, she would kind of move or see him come over and
[00:36:15] watch him.
[00:36:16] And then he realized she had one arm.
[00:36:19] And when it came time for him to receive his silver medal that he earned, he asked
[00:36:27] Jim to come up on the podium with him.
[00:36:30] And when he was given the silver medal, he took it from around his neck and put it around
[00:36:34] Jim's neck and gifted the silver medal that he worked so hard for to the shung eight
[00:36:41] year old Australian girl.
[00:36:43] And I had the opportunity to email back and forth with Jim as father, who, again, is Australian.
[00:36:52] And he went on to tell me how that had just completely changed Jim's life.
[00:36:58] But other interesting thing he told me, he said, you know, Jim as arm was not amputated.
[00:37:03] She was born without that arm.
[00:37:04] And he said, and there's a psychological difference between having your arm amputated or
[00:37:09] being born without an arm.
[00:37:11] So he made that distinction clear to me.
[00:37:15] And he went on to say that, you know, from Mike doing that, what Mike probably thought was
[00:37:21] a very simple gesture.
[00:37:24] It just dramatically changed Jim as life.
[00:37:28] And now she's competing in sports as a matter of fact, I see pictures of her on Instagram,
[00:37:35] where she's winning swim meets.
[00:37:37] And she's just ready to tear it up because of this very simple leadership gesture that
[00:37:45] that Mike caught your demonstrated to her.
[00:37:48] And it just goes to show you that the simple things we do in life as leaders have a profound
[00:37:54] effect on those that we do those things for.
[00:37:59] And you know, it's similar to the butterfly effect.
[00:38:03] You know, this could have a generational impact.
[00:38:07] I don't want to sound too dramatic here, but it could have a generational impact on
[00:38:12] Gemma.
[00:38:13] And on Gemma's children, if she has children someday, et cetera, et cetera, just because
[00:38:17] of that very selfless act that Mike caught you in.
[00:38:21] And you got to realize, you know, you were a car to get the silver medal.
[00:38:25] You know, I mean, just to give it away like that, the somebody that you don't really know
[00:38:30] was quite a gesture.
[00:38:32] So that's that's the story about Mike.
[00:38:34] Yeah, I can only imagine a young girl like that and, you know, young girls and boys,
[00:38:40] but I would, I've got three daughters and one son and I would say that girls are really
[00:38:44] self-conscious about, you know, those kind of things, their body, their self-conscious
[00:38:49] about that and you could imagine someone like Gemma who's sort of avoiding any time where
[00:38:55] all of a sudden this becomes the focus is that what's different about her and him just
[00:39:01] coming along and saying, yeah, it's cool.
[00:39:02] Yeah.
[00:39:03] It's good.
[00:39:04] Don't worry about it.
[00:39:05] Go do your thing.
[00:39:06] That just changed your life.
[00:39:07] That's awesome to hear.
[00:39:08] Yeah.
[00:39:09] Yeah.
[00:39:10] You wrap up this idea here.
[00:39:13] You say self-discipline.
[00:39:14] Giving up could become a habit.
[00:39:16] Giving up to the same hard and striving continually to get better is also habit.
[00:39:20] Habits are developed through repetition and where self-discipline comes in.
[00:39:23] Leaders who are self-disciplined adhere to the same standards they have set for their followers.
[00:39:29] They lead by example and share hardships, struggles and tough jobs with their followers.
[00:39:34] By the way, adhering to the same standards you expect from others and sharing the load
[00:39:39] are two of several actions a leader must take to instill, trust throughout an organization.
[00:39:45] What this has been people have the motivation to do the hard work behind the scenes which
[00:39:49] makes them great at what they do.
[00:39:51] These people have the drive to act in order to make themselves better and to avoid anything
[00:39:55] detrimental to achieving their goals.
[00:39:57] This work ethic generally has a way of making everyone around them better too.
[00:40:02] Self-disciplined leaders have a bias for action and in uncertain times, leaders to spell
[00:40:08] uncertainty through competent and confident actions.
[00:40:11] Self-disciplined leaders have an offensive mindset and do not allow setbacks or obstacles
[00:40:16] to stop progress.
[00:40:17] Good leaders find a way to win and inspire faith and belief throughout an organization.
[00:40:23] Some people are born with a greater propensity to be self-disciplined than others.
[00:40:27] Like other traits, self-disciplined can be developed.
[00:40:30] For those who have poor self-discipline, I have found the best way to improve self-discipline
[00:40:35] is to do some small things and work yourself into a more difficult things.
[00:40:39] If you hit a bump and backslide a bit, do not beat yourself up, just get back with the
[00:40:44] program.
[00:40:45] Remember, good habits are developed through self-discipline of continuing to do those things.
[00:40:52] I can ask this question a decent amount.
[00:40:57] Am I disciplined because I was in the Navy or am I disciplined because I am disciplined?
[00:41:03] And I don't know, what do you think?
[00:41:06] I think the training that you receive the Navy certainly helped is my belief.
[00:41:13] I think goals are important.
[00:41:18] If you have no goals in your life, nothing that's meaningful and purposeful for you to
[00:41:25] work toward.
[00:41:27] But the hell are you going to be disciplined about?
[00:41:29] You're going to be kind of like just drifting one way or another.
[00:41:34] I think people that have specific goals, you're goal to be a seal, you're goal, venture
[00:41:41] where a seal to be a seal commander, etc., etc., kind of sets you up to be more disciplined
[00:41:51] about achieving those goals.
[00:41:55] I think it's probably a little bit of both.
[00:41:58] But I do think the path you chose and those goals you had probably did a lot to help
[00:42:05] you become a very self-discipline person.
[00:42:09] Then you think that's the same for you then.
[00:42:11] Well, I do.
[00:42:13] I think if I didn't take the path I did by getting into an army, I probably wouldn't
[00:42:21] have had the benefit of those NCOs and other role models who showed me that in order
[00:42:28] to achieve something you really got to work hard for.
[00:42:31] Now, when I was growing up as a kid, my dad, my family tried to show me those things.
[00:42:37] So I think it's kind of I think building blocks along to Wayne your life.
[00:42:47] You're going to learn some of that from your family.
[00:42:49] Then I'm a big believer in sports.
[00:42:51] You play sports.
[00:42:52] I play sports in high school.
[00:42:55] You have to be disciplined in order to get out there on a field and not get yourself
[00:42:59] beat up.
[00:43:01] And then you join the military and again, you've got to show some discipline in order
[00:43:06] to...
[00:43:07] Because you know, people are counting on you in order to achieve what you want to
[00:43:11] in that regard.
[00:43:12] So I think it's really like building blocks as you go through your life.
[00:43:18] Some people are fortunate to have role models and mentors in their life who are going
[00:43:25] to show them why discipline is important.
[00:43:28] And then you just continue with it.
[00:43:30] Yeah, I think I was...
[00:43:31] I don't know if this is luck, you're unlucky.
[00:43:33] I was lucky in the fact that I wasn't really great at anything.
[00:43:36] When I had the single teams, if I didn't work hard, I was going to look like an idiot.
[00:43:40] And I didn't want to look like an idiot.
[00:43:42] And I didn't want to let my teammates down.
[00:43:44] So I had to just work hard to be ready for stuff.
[00:43:48] That's definitely the...
[00:43:49] That definitely influenced my path quite a bit.
[00:43:52] I think if I would have been a natural, a naturally gifted athlete, I would have had
[00:44:00] less discipline.
[00:44:01] I wouldn't need it as much discipline.
[00:44:03] But the other thing you had to remember is people get out of the sealed teams.
[00:44:06] And sometimes they're even still in the sealed teams and they let themselves go.
[00:44:10] They don't practice, they don't train, they get out of shape.
[00:44:13] Yeah.
[00:44:14] So just because you were in the military, just because you were in the sealed teams or whatever
[00:44:21] you did, and you got to maintain that discipline.
[00:44:24] That discipline is not a chip that they put into your brain and now you've got it.
[00:44:29] You don't have to worry about anymore.
[00:44:31] No, you still got to go.
[00:44:33] Yeah, you know, Jack, I do think that's why purpose is so important.
[00:44:37] And those goals are so important because the same at Ranger School.
[00:44:40] You get that Ranger tab and that's when the hard work should start because now you've
[00:44:46] got to prove it every day that I deserve to have this Ranger tab on my shoulder.
[00:44:51] And I see it, you know, folks I know that went the Ranger School and out there out of the
[00:44:57] military and they'd just let themselves go.
[00:45:00] And it's probably because they don't have that purpose anymore or that goal anymore.
[00:45:06] And I think that's an unfortunate thing and that's why purpose is so important.
[00:45:11] That's why I think leaders have to be able to communicate purpose to their followers.
[00:45:17] So they're followers understand.
[00:45:19] And I know you talk about this in your, like, how do we have leadership book?
[00:45:22] You know, so people understand why am I doing this thing that the leader has told me to
[00:45:28] do?
[00:45:29] Well, if you don't explain the purpose, the leaders aren't, or the followers aren't going
[00:45:32] to get it.
[00:45:33] Yeah, 100%.
[00:45:34] Yeah.
[00:45:35] Um, fast forward a little bit, digging it in respect.
[00:45:38] Leaders demonstrate leaders demonstrate respect for others by the words they choose
[00:45:42] the tone of voice they use and by treating people with dignity.
[00:45:45] Demonstrating respect is also about being considered of a person's time and showing interest
[00:45:49] in what others think.
[00:45:51] Good leaders treat others respectfully regardless of position.
[00:45:54] Good leaders treat the maintenance person with the same amount of respect they treat the
[00:45:58] CEO.
[00:46:00] I believe it is impossible to be toxic leader to be autoxic leader if you treat those people
[00:46:05] you lead with dignity and respect.
[00:46:07] This does not mean you cannot hold people to the prescribed standard and counsel them.
[00:46:11] However, there is a dignified and respectful way to do those things.
[00:46:15] A leader could even fire someone in a dignified and respectful way.
[00:46:19] A rule to follow is praise and public, reprimand and private.
[00:46:23] Now, what's interesting about this paragraph is this is anybody that doesn't, that has
[00:46:28] sort of a surface view of the military.
[00:46:30] They don't think that this is applicable at all in the military.
[00:46:34] I guess it's just from boot camp movies, right?
[00:46:37] I guess it's just from full metal jacket.
[00:46:39] Full metal jacket has given and I love that movie.
[00:46:43] It's a great movie.
[00:46:44] It's incredible movie and it is accurate.
[00:46:47] You know, you talk to any marine look, they don't use the same language that they used
[00:46:51] back then.
[00:46:52] But man, boot camp is boot camp and it is yelling and screaming, making people uncomfortable
[00:46:57] and really not treating them with treating them with disrespect, especially in the beginning.
[00:47:03] So I think movies like that have given this false image of the military that that's
[00:47:09] how military leadership works and it is not true.
[00:47:14] Now are there leaders that act like that?
[00:47:16] Yeah, they're absolutely are in the military.
[00:47:17] And I guess what?
[00:47:18] There's leaders that act like that in the civilian sector too, that are disrespectful
[00:47:22] that treat people bad.
[00:47:23] And leadership positions and it's not good.
[00:47:27] And what's interesting about this is I can yell and scream.
[00:47:31] If I if I'm your boss, I can yell at screaming you and you're probably going to do what
[00:47:35] I tell you.
[00:47:36] You're intimidated.
[00:47:37] You don't want to get fired.
[00:47:39] You don't want to hear me yell and scream.
[00:47:42] So you go do what I tell you to do.
[00:47:44] And so I get some positive feedback on my yelling and screaming.
[00:47:48] However, as soon as you get home, you're on monster.com looking for a new job because
[00:47:51] you don't want to be working with me because I'm a jerk.
[00:47:54] And by the way, how much effort do you actually give?
[00:47:56] Do you give 110%?
[00:47:58] No, you probably give 72%, which is the bare minimum you needed to give to get the job done.
[00:48:04] So all my yelling and screaming got me the bare minimum that you are going to produce.
[00:48:08] Whereas if I treated you with respect, you're going to have 110%.
[00:48:11] You're going to do that job better than I could do it and better than you could do it with
[00:48:16] your minimum effort.
[00:48:17] So this idea, treating people with respect, I mean, this is just, it seems like common sense.
[00:48:24] And I think sometimes, I mean, I had this happen when I started working with companies.
[00:48:28] The very, actually it wasn't the very first.
[00:48:30] It was one of the first companies I started working with.
[00:48:32] And I'm on the phone with the CEO doing an introductory call.
[00:48:36] And he says, I can't wait to get out here and whip my people into shape.
[00:48:40] And I said, hey, you know, something, if you want something to whip your people into shape,
[00:48:43] you should get someone else.
[00:48:45] Because whipping people is what happened, that's what you do to slaves.
[00:48:48] And slaves is not a good environment.
[00:48:50] And no one wants to be a slave.
[00:48:52] And they don't do the job that they're supposed to do.
[00:48:54] They'll do the bare minimum so they don't get a punished for it.
[00:48:59] So I'm glad you got this section in here.
[00:49:01] Yeah, you know, Jack, I have, you know, business owners talking to me about that all the time.
[00:49:06] You know, like, why can't I be a toxic leader?
[00:49:08] You know, I get, get the job done, you know, get shit done, you know, that type of thing.
[00:49:14] And that's kind of like, you know what, you could be a toxic leader.
[00:49:17] And like you said, you could yell and scream and people are going to listen to you.
[00:49:20] And they're going to do it.
[00:49:22] But if you're looking for a sustained success over the long period of time, that's where,
[00:49:28] you know, toxic leadership does not work.
[00:49:31] Because toxic leadership could work for short-term gain.
[00:49:35] But if you want sustained success over time, that's not the way to do it.
[00:49:40] Certainly is not.
[00:49:42] Fast forward a little bit here.
[00:49:46] And again, if you're listening to me read this, I'm just jumping through various sections.
[00:49:51] It's not going to sound completely cohesive as I read it.
[00:49:53] But you get the book and it is completely cohesive.
[00:49:56] Next section I want to read here is to be successful in life, you must make yourself
[00:50:00] vulnerable.
[00:50:01] There's no risk without reward.
[00:50:02] With that said, the risk you take must be prudent and must include risk analysis and
[00:50:06] risk mitigation measures.
[00:50:08] Nothing is risk free and seldom can a person eliminate risk entirely.
[00:50:11] Although risk cannot be eliminated, leaders must identify ways to reduce the most probable
[00:50:18] and highest impact risks.
[00:50:22] I think this is funny because I say to leaders all the time, if there's no risk, it's
[00:50:26] not even a decision.
[00:50:27] What's the decision?
[00:50:28] If there's no risk and it's just a benefit, we're doing it.
[00:50:31] We're not even talking about that's not a decision.
[00:50:32] That's just what we're doing.
[00:50:34] Yeah, absolutely.
[00:50:38] And I think that's why some leaders fail to have the courage to make decisions because
[00:50:43] with almost any decision you're making, there's some sort of risk associated with that.
[00:50:50] And again, if you're going to look at gaining anything for your organization, we talked
[00:51:01] about moving yourself out of your comfort zone, you've got to move your organization
[00:51:05] out of its comfort zone too.
[00:51:08] And so it's about, okay, understanding what those risks are and then how am I going to
[00:51:14] reduce the probability of this happening and also reduce the impact of it happening.
[00:51:20] And those are certain steps you could take.
[00:51:24] I talked about optimism a lot and especially if you hit a really bad day, a really bad
[00:51:33] day.
[00:51:36] You have to be optimistic and then lead your organization through that.
[00:51:41] But it's not just because you're telling people, hey, things are going to get better.
[00:51:46] You've actually got to put a plan together that's believable to your followers.
[00:51:52] So it's just not about, you know, what you say, it's about, okay, what plan have we put
[00:51:58] together now that's going to show that we're going to be able to do things a little bit
[00:52:03] differently to overcome this adversity.
[00:52:05] So that's really, and it takes a lot of hard work and it doesn't come easy.
[00:52:12] Yeah, I was, when I talk about you got to believe in the mission, right?
[00:52:16] And I say, believe isn't doesn't mean the old say, if you can believe it, you can
[00:52:22] achieve it.
[00:52:23] Actually not true.
[00:52:24] Because I could say, I believe I can find it's not I'm not going to be able to fly to
[00:52:27] me believe belief in the mission means you see an actual pathway to achieve the mission.
[00:52:32] And I might be challenging and there's going to be bumps in hurdles and obstacles along the
[00:52:35] way, but we are going to be able to do it and hey, everyone, here's how we're going to get
[00:52:39] there.
[00:52:40] And as long as you can show people an actual pathway to get to this victory, then
[00:52:44] you can then people can believe in what you're doing for sure.
[00:52:47] Yeah.
[00:52:48] Yeah.
[00:52:49] And, you know, I'll just reflect back on a bad day.
[00:52:53] You know, I had January 5th, 2006, I think you're familiar with the glass factory bombing
[00:53:00] there and in Ramadi.
[00:53:02] And you know, you have a bad day like that and you just, you know, as a leader, you just can't
[00:53:13] cave in because it's so.
[00:53:14] So give everyone a little brief.
[00:53:16] I mean, obviously, I knew about it.
[00:53:18] I arrived there shortly thereafter and I tracked it as it happened.
[00:53:20] I mean, it was a horrific incident at a police recruiting event.
[00:53:25] So recruiting local police in the city of Ramadi to come and join the Iraqi police and
[00:53:32] become the defenders of the city and help the local populist.
[00:53:37] What we talked about earlier, defend the populist here.
[00:53:39] You go, come and sign up and it was actually going pretty well.
[00:53:44] And then this event happened.
[00:53:45] Yeah, it was going remarkably well.
[00:53:46] You know, when we first got there, I guess, was Jaloon or Jalai of 2005, mixed June and
[00:53:54] July, I'm there.
[00:53:55] Of course, but Jalai of 2005, you know, we started police recruiting events and we'd
[00:54:04] have like two or three people show up to join the police.
[00:54:09] I mean, it was pathetic.
[00:54:11] And you know, we started to talk to the shakes and actually through our talks with the
[00:54:17] shakes, they would tell us some things that our troops were doing that probably weren't
[00:54:24] that beneficial to the citizens of Ramadi.
[00:54:28] So we started to change up some of our tactics and procedures.
[00:54:32] That didn't affect our operation, but it helped the shakes understand that, hey, we were
[00:54:37] really here for your people, for your tribe.
[00:54:41] And this really demonstrated self in January of 2006.
[00:54:49] We held this recruiting event.
[00:54:56] And on January 3rd, we had 200 people show up at the glass factory in Ramadi where we're
[00:55:02] conducting this event.
[00:55:03] And the glass factory is an old factory, but it's a nice big building and it was right
[00:55:07] outside or very close to the main US camp of camp or Maddie.
[00:55:13] So it was a pretty good spot to do.
[00:55:14] Exactly.
[00:55:15] It was a good spot to do it.
[00:55:17] 200 people showed up the first day.
[00:55:19] It's like we can't believe this.
[00:55:20] Like before we were having two or three people show up.
[00:55:23] We got 200 people standing in line to join the police.
[00:55:26] So the shake, you know, that told us the shakes were getting the word out to other tribes,
[00:55:29] people to hate.
[00:55:30] Come in, we trust these Americans.
[00:55:33] Come in.
[00:55:34] And so the second day, we had around 450, 500 people standing in line to join the police.
[00:55:39] It's like this is incredible.
[00:55:42] The third day is I reflect back on it.
[00:55:47] Whenever you're operating in an uncertainty environment, you don't want to do things three
[00:55:51] days in a row.
[00:55:52] So it was a big mistake I made.
[00:55:55] Third day, we had about 800 people standing in line.
[00:55:58] I mean, we were ecstatic.
[00:56:00] We thought we really turned a corner here.
[00:56:03] And a suicide bomber because this was a third day in a row we were doing.
[00:56:07] A suicide bomber shows up and detonates their vest right in the middle of this large
[00:56:13] crowd, killing over 100 Iraqis and killed a Marine dog handler, a sergeant con and also
[00:56:22] a good friend of mine, Lieutenant Colonel Mike McLaughlin, and injured several other
[00:56:27] of our soldiers.
[00:56:28] Some severely but thank God no one else died.
[00:56:32] No other US military died from that attack.
[00:56:36] And so that was a really, really bad day.
[00:56:42] The way I handled it is I brought the leaders together the following day because two weeks
[00:56:50] from that particular day, we were going to have 200 Iraqis show up at the glass factory
[00:56:56] again so we could ship them the bag dead to attend police training.
[00:57:01] So we knew where we were going to have a similar situation.
[00:57:03] So got everybody together next day and the importance of leaders admitting when they do
[00:57:09] something wrong I think really comes out here because when I got everybody together I
[00:57:13] don't know what they were thinking.
[00:57:15] Maybe they were thinking I was going to try to blame somebody I don't know but the first
[00:57:18] thing I said was we're not going to waste time fixing blame on anybody because I'm the
[00:57:25] one responsible for this.
[00:57:27] So forget about fixing blame.
[00:57:29] But it's on me what we need to spend our time doing is talk about how are we going to change
[00:57:34] things so this doesn't happen two weeks from now when we do the same event again.
[00:57:40] Because we had to publicize this so people knew to show up so it's not like you're
[00:57:45] keeping it from the insurgents.
[00:57:47] And so I'm not going to get into the details of how we change things but we change things
[00:57:51] significantly in terms of the way the outside of that glass factory was set up.
[00:57:56] So if God forbid a suicide bomber was going to blow themselves up again the most they could
[00:58:01] take out would be about 10 people rather than 100 or more.
[00:58:06] And so the point is when leaders hit these bad days this adversity there's the organization
[00:58:18] is counting on you to find a way through it.
[00:58:22] And that was a lesson I learned. I mentioned this book is filled with mistakes.
[00:58:29] I made that I was able to learn from and by putting this book out hopefully others won't
[00:58:34] have to make similar mistakes.
[00:58:39] So the whole point of what I just said is when you hit adversity you've got to be able
[00:58:49] to be resilient enough to fight your way through that for the organization.
[00:58:53] And again that's not going to come by itself.
[00:58:57] You've got to prepare and develop your resiliency before these bad days happen because
[00:59:03] we all know they're going to happen.
[00:59:05] And then it's also the important part of a leader admitting they made a mistake.
[00:59:12] So the organization doesn't have to start pointing fingers at one another because if you
[00:59:17] don't do that and you can't develop that sense of trust because people know when you're
[00:59:23] screwed up.
[00:59:25] And if people are expecting more energy on watching their own back they're not going
[00:59:32] to be expanding energy on getting done with the organization needs to get done because
[00:59:39] watching your own back takes a hell of a lot of energy doesn't it?
[00:59:42] And so that's really the moral of the story.
[00:59:46] And you were there when we had a blue on blue that I wrote about an extreme ownership
[00:59:52] and it's the same exact approach I took which was hey there's a friendly Iraqi soldier
[00:59:59] dead there's several Iraqis wounded one of my guys is wounded who we're going to blame.
[01:00:04] Don't look any further than me because this is on me and it is on me.
[01:00:07] This is happening.
[01:00:08] I'm the senior guy on the battlefield.
[01:00:09] This is 100% my fault.
[01:00:11] And that way yeah we don't have to look at who are going to point fingers at no one has to
[01:00:15] worry about hey I'm going to leave you out the dry I'm not going to hang you out to dry.
[01:00:18] This is 100% on me and then we how do we prevent this from ever happening again.
[01:00:23] So the thing a leader has to do in those situations.
[01:00:25] Yeah absolutely.
[01:00:29] Fast forward a little bit here you talk about creating a vision you say the concept
[01:00:34] of a leader providing a vision to an organization they lead is at least 2000 years old
[01:00:39] in the king's James version of the Bible Proverbs 29 18 reads where there is no vision
[01:00:46] the people perish.
[01:00:49] And early point my experience leading people I became aware that providing a vision of
[01:00:52] the future was one of the most important things a leader can do.
[01:00:55] The whole concept of leadership is about taking people to a place where they could not reach
[01:00:59] on their own.
[01:01:00] I have found that when I provide a vision of the future to a group I lead it motivates
[01:01:04] and inspires them to work toward achieving a desired end state.
[01:01:08] And as well I believe creating a shared vision and communicating it consistently are important
[01:01:13] roles of a leader.
[01:01:15] Visualizing achievement is essential if you are to gain success.
[01:01:21] A vision must be a simple unique ideal image of the future.
[01:01:25] Ideally the vision a leader develop should be a shared vision.
[01:01:29] A shared vision not only does not only mean every in the organization believes in the vision
[01:01:35] but also that representative members of the organization have provided input to create the
[01:01:41] vision.
[01:01:41] Occasionally I will get I talk about decentralized command all the time with all the companies
[01:01:49] I work with and occasionally I will get someone saying hey you know I feel like the team
[01:01:56] doesn't really know where we are going and I am trying to lead them in the right direction
[01:01:58] but I don't want to impose it on them and I say listen it is okay for a leader
[01:02:04] sometimes say hey everyone this is where we are going because not everyone has the visibility
[01:02:09] that you have from your leadership perspective you know if you are in charge of a project
[01:02:14] not everyone can see all the moving pieces so they might not see hey this is where we
[01:02:18] need to go this is what we are doing.
[01:02:20] Is it good to get input for that collective vision absolutely but you may be in a situation
[01:02:26] where other members of the team don't have the vision that you have because just because
[01:02:30] of where you are sitting or where you are standing you can see a little bit more you have
[01:02:34] a little bit more visibility on things so sometimes you do have to make the vision and
[01:02:37] as soon as you make that vision your vision doesn't isn't written in stone or you shouldn't
[01:02:42] write your vision in stone if you write your vision in stone you are probably making a
[01:02:45] mistake and some people might think that that sounds weak well you are going to change
[01:02:49] your vision actually I may change the vision if we get to a point where we need something
[01:02:53] just like when you are in a body say hey wait a second we have been doing things like
[01:02:56] this we are not getting any progress with the shakes the shakes your tone is oh
[01:02:59] guess what we are going to do a just our vision so there is nothing wrong with a
[01:03:03] just new vision and there is nothing wrong with if you are not getting feedback it is
[01:03:06] okay cool watch this here is the vision here is what we are going to do start moving
[01:03:10] that direction adapt as needed yeah you know totally agree one one thing I learned when
[01:03:17] got this is back around late 90s around the year 2000 was before 9-11 when I took
[01:03:27] man to 55th brigade you know national guard brigade so you know about 3000
[01:03:32] soldiers distributed across northeastern Pennsylvania down toward the Philadelphia area and
[01:03:38] you know 85% of them had full times of laying jobs so like man I got a
[01:03:44] develop a vision for this organization in order for us to show some you know to move
[01:03:49] forward here and what I did is I went around to representative
[01:03:55] sampling of soldiers who were part of that brigade I would talk to a PFC
[01:04:01] that had like a year in Norm you know I would talk to a major who had may or may be
[01:04:05] 16-17 years in the army and every and a few folks in between there I mean
[01:04:11] 3000 soldiers can't talk to all of them and say hey where do you want to see
[01:04:14] this brigade go and the question I would ask them I would say hey you know if you
[01:04:19] fell asleep for five years and woke up five years from now what would you want to see
[01:04:23] this brigade look like then you know and the funny thing is whether it was a soldier
[01:04:29] low rank one year experience or higher ranking officer with 17 years experience
[01:04:34] everybody kind of wanted the same thing they wanted to be well trained so if we
[01:04:39] had a deploy we'd be able to do our jobs successfully and that ended up
[01:04:43] essentially what what what the vision was so what it taught me and this goes for any
[01:04:48] business leader out there trying to develop a vision for their organization and
[01:04:52] many organizations are working distributed now you know with the pandemic and
[01:04:56] everything else it's try to get you know when I say shared vision try to get a
[01:05:01] representative sample if you could of where people would like to see it go
[01:05:04] and ultimately use the leader like you said you you've got a broader view of
[01:05:08] everything so yeah it's you finally got to put a stake in the ground say yeah
[01:05:12] this is going to be our vision but I think it's good I need to get a representative
[01:05:16] samples sampling of those in your organization and and then you know when you
[01:05:23] get it out there you know you've got to you've got to share it in a an
[01:05:27] multitude of ways you know when you're speaking to people one-on-one you've got
[01:05:32] a communicate that vision you're speaking to a group of 500 you've got to
[01:05:36] communicate the vision through email through your website through whatever you
[01:05:41] know social media means you might want to use but the vision then has to be
[01:05:46] consistent you know can't be a new flavor of the month or a new vision of
[01:05:51] the quarter you know like you said visions could change but it shouldn't be
[01:05:55] changing on a very very frequent basis that's what I learned about developing a
[01:06:00] vision you know over 20 years ago yeah and it's it's always interesting like
[01:06:04] that's alignment right no matter who you talk to you talk to a frontline
[01:06:09] individual that's been in the army for six months you talk to someone that's
[01:06:12] been in the army for 20 years in listed officer on both ends of that
[01:06:16] spectrum and they all say oh well I'd like that if we get deployed we're ready to
[01:06:20] do our job that you can make so many decisions based on that just knowing
[01:06:25] that right there hey is it going to help us do our job if we spend time you know
[01:06:29] clowning around at work on our drill weekend is it going to help us be ready to
[01:06:33] do our job no it's not so let's do something else and that goes up and now
[01:06:36] the chain of command and now that we have that shared aligned vision now we can
[01:06:40] all make a bunch of decisions just based on the fact that we know that when
[01:06:44] we deploy we want to be ready to do our job we want to be effective okay does
[01:06:48] this help us be effective or not and we can make a decision so that's important
[01:06:52] stuff fast forward a little bit you know let's get a chapter in here called
[01:06:57] keeping your feet on the ground which is about humility you say I worked for an
[01:07:01] arrogant leader before it was not any fun all of us who work for this man felt
[01:07:06] our opinions were not valued he was the kind of guy who said things like when
[01:07:10] I want your opinion I'll tell you what it is stereotypical military but not
[01:07:16] actual military we believe we were not respected and we felt more like objects
[01:07:20] rather than we were part of the team the results are initiative imagination and
[01:07:25] creativity were stifled as you could imagine the leader failed again this is a
[01:07:30] this is one of those false images of military leadership does it happen yes it
[01:07:37] does happen and here's something else let's say about this you want to know
[01:07:41] what it does happen more often in the military and one of the reason it happens
[01:07:45] more often in the military is because in the military you're only in command
[01:07:49] for two years generally speaking so most of the enlisted guys you work in
[01:07:54] for a jerk or an arrogant person it takes them three months or three to six
[01:07:58] months ago hey this guy really is arrogant then at six months are like oh
[01:08:01] god what are we going to do about it this guy is horrible now to year now
[01:08:05] they start thinking hey we should really do something about this we should get
[01:08:07] rid of this guy we should run an opportunity command we should fill out our
[01:08:10] surveys our command climate surveys and report what a jerk this guy is and then
[01:08:14] it's eighteen months and then they go you know he's gonna be gone at six
[01:08:16] months let's just freaking deal with it and that guy never gets the feedback and
[01:08:20] so everything that he did worked and it's positive feedback and it's a positive
[01:08:25] feedback loop he thinks he did a good job because he yelled and screamed and didn't
[01:08:28] take anyone's opinion and now he gets promoted that's the unfortunate reality
[01:08:32] of the military yeah and the other interesting thing with that you know we could
[01:08:35] call that guy a toxic leader is I found that toxic leaders are very good at
[01:08:42] not letting their people they work for their superior officers but if you want to
[01:08:47] call it see their toxicity oh for sure they're able to hide it I've known a lot of
[01:08:52] military leaders that everyone above them in the chain of command loved them
[01:08:57] everybody below the chain of command hated them yeah because above the chain of
[01:09:01] command they see when someone does make-in stuff happen right below the chain of
[01:09:04] command they're getting they're the ones that are freaking being driven to you
[01:09:08] know bloody fingers as they try and get the job done and yeah that that
[01:09:12] happens often yeah it's amazing how good they are at hiding that toxicity when
[01:09:17] they're talking to somebody who who they work for yeah and you got to be
[01:09:20] careful as a leader to make sure that that's not happening that's why it's
[01:09:24] important like you said to go down and talk to the troops yeah and say hey
[01:09:29] what's that goes Charles like as a leader how's that going and you know what
[01:09:32] they're gonna say at first they say he's great but you got to ask them well
[01:09:35] how often does he talk to do you take your you got to dig it out of them
[01:09:38] because most of them they don't want to they don't want to make they don't want
[01:09:42] that beef as echo would say yeah you know the the more you get down there
[01:09:48] you know I call it muddy muddy boots leadership they're more to get down there
[01:09:51] talk to the troops you know whether it be militarious civilian then you're
[01:09:56] able to develop that trust too because you're right the first time you go
[01:09:59] down and ask somebody hey how's it going they're not going to be totally honest
[01:10:02] with you if they don't know you but the more they get used to seeing you come
[01:10:06] around and and just having a rapport and see that you're hey normal guy and you
[01:10:11] really do want the best for the organization they're going to loosen up until
[01:10:14] later truth also don't burn your sources you know don't don't go back and
[01:10:18] say hey echo I need to talk to you John Gronsky said you were a tyrant and
[01:10:24] all that's not you're never going to get any information again no so you have
[01:10:28] to be careful about that one fast forward a little bit one of the best ways
[01:10:32] a leader could show respect to others is by asking for their opinion and
[01:10:35] then seriously considering it leaders and powers others in an organization
[01:10:39] simply by listening to state level headed and keep ones feet placed firmly on
[01:10:43] the ground leaders must acknowledge others for their contributions to this
[01:10:46] teams success so this is something I I've written about talking about
[01:10:53] listening is I think is the most underrated possibly the most underrated
[01:10:58] aspect of leadership the only other one that's in a close second and it correlates
[01:11:03] very directly is asking earnest questions ask earnest questions and then
[01:11:07] listen to what people have to say and you know some leaders think
[01:11:13] they're listening but their actions don't show that they're listening you know like
[01:11:18] you're going to talk to somebody hey could I have a minute could I talk to you
[01:11:22] and you know leader is you know checking their phone while you're talking to them
[01:11:26] or they're you know tapping something on the keyboard or they're their computer while
[01:11:30] you're talking to them or you're talking to them they're looking off at somebody else you
[01:11:33] know it's kind of like wow is this guy really listening to me you know that
[01:11:37] leader might think they're listening but their actions are showing that they're not
[01:11:39] really listening so it's it's important that you you really do that act of listening
[01:11:44] actually listen yeah yeah fast forward a little bit identify your core values
[01:11:50] to develop strong character you must take the time to figure out what you stand for
[01:11:54] and what your core values really are this came to light for me many years ago
[01:11:58] I attended a dinner at which the speaker gave an impassion talk about his own personal
[01:12:02] core values the next day as I was still thinking about what I heard I realized if someone
[01:12:05] asked me what my personal core values were I would not be able to give an answer
[01:12:10] sure I had values I tried to be an ethical person but to that point I never took the time
[01:12:16] to think long and hard about exactly what I stood for and my principles I never took the
[01:12:21] time to consider what values were most important to me important you know
[01:12:28] the other thing about values if if you don't understand what your own personal core
[01:12:34] values are when you make personal decisions or when it comes a time for you to make a personal
[01:12:40] decision about something I really believe you have to factor your your personal core
[01:12:48] values into decisions you make so if you don't have those core values articulated in your
[01:12:54] own mind how are you going to factor them in your decision and the same with organizations
[01:12:59] you know organizations many organizations have organizational values but when the leadership team
[01:13:05] gets together with the CEO and they're in the you know they're going through this decision
[01:13:10] making process how many of them actually factor the organizational values into the decision that
[01:13:17] they're making which I I would think I would just guess many don't even think about their values
[01:13:25] when they're making a business decision which is crazy to think about yeah if you're making decisions
[01:13:30] that you might as well just be making decisions in the blind exactly and then and then you're
[01:13:35] not being true to your values and again that breaks trust with your customers or that breaks
[01:13:39] trust with your employees or whom ever that particular decision is going to affect so yeah really
[01:13:46] that's why values are so important I believe and then the other thing behaviors I think are
[01:13:52] important too you know I I know a lot of organizations are getting you know they do have
[01:13:57] organizational values but now they're also getting into organizational behaviors so they actually
[01:14:03] list out you know maybe between 10 to 20 behaviors that they expect from their employees which I think
[01:14:10] is is very important as a matter of fact a consulting firm I used to work for green castle consulting
[01:14:17] has expected behaviors that they want their consultants to demonstrate and I think that's a
[01:14:27] a very good way to look at things because you know values are kind of conceptual behaviors are
[01:14:33] more tangible and and I do think you know identifying expected behaviors is really helpful in
[01:14:43] getting your employees to treat customers or treat each other the way you want them to.
[01:14:48] Yeah this is something that I was acutely aware of especially with kids and when I wrote the first
[01:14:56] warrior kid book the whole actually the entire premise of the first book is the kid has to come up with
[01:15:03] a warrior kid code of what he's going to and and his uncle in this book it's a kids book but
[01:15:10] the kid's uncle is uh was it was in the seal teams and so he introduces him he can see that the
[01:15:15] kid's kind of floating around not making the best decisions and so he says hey warriors live by a
[01:15:20] code and I point out you know the Marine Corps values the the the Ranger code the I just point out
[01:15:27] the you know the ancient you know the Samurai code the Viking gods I'm not putting them all in the book
[01:15:33] and say hey you need to make your own code and the kid ends up writing his own code and the uncle
[01:15:38] approves it this warrior kid code and then eventually I wrote another book called the code the
[01:15:42] evaluation of protocols which literally has like a code saying hey as an adult you still need a code
[01:15:48] you still need to figure out what it is you're trying to do what he trying to do with your life and if again
[01:15:53] if you have this code in place hey I want to be healthy cool is that donut gonna help be
[01:15:57] be healthy no it's not don't eat it hey I want to be uh I want to spend quality time with my family
[01:16:04] okay why am I watching TV right now okay don't watch TV if you have something to live by then it's
[01:16:10] gonna make your life that much better and and that's why the the warrior kid code and the
[01:16:15] code evaluation protocol that's the purpose of those say hey listen and and in both those cases
[01:16:20] I say right your own code because you shouldn't follow my code but I can pretty much guarantee you
[01:16:26] most people would have an 80% overlap on what their code is gonna be I mean I might be more into
[01:16:31] you know martial arts than someone else might be more into fishing but if you're gonna focus on
[01:16:38] some part of your life it's gonna be an 80% who doesn't want to be healthy who doesn't want to have a
[01:16:42] good family who doesn't want to be financially successful who wants to save money like all these things
[01:16:46] it's a 90% solution and mate you can make some small adjustments to it but to wander through life without
[01:16:52] that stuff is exactly that it's wandering through life yeah you know jacco i think you putting that
[01:16:57] emphasis on code and in in that book is one of the best things you've ever done because if you
[01:17:04] want to keep people on an ethical path one of the guardrails to to stay on that ethical path is
[01:17:12] by actually writing down what your own personal code is and then that will help you stay grounded
[01:17:19] and help you stay on that path that that's just a great technique to use to keep somebody you know
[01:17:26] staying within those limits because how many times have we seen CEO CEOs governors you know
[01:17:33] stray ethically off the path president yeah president you know anyone in the chain of
[01:17:38] your band yeah bottom of the top yeah and and again it's because they either never took the time to
[01:17:44] write down their own personal code or if they've written a down now they're not paying attention to it
[01:17:49] so I think that's great advice you gave out there um this is one of the sections where I actually
[01:17:54] made a note of your action set section of the book so here here's the actions and you did this
[01:18:00] for every one of these sections you get you identify actions that actually take to move forward
[01:18:07] and improve this area of leadership so here the actions are identify your own personal core values
[01:18:13] ensure your personal personal core values and the values of the organization you work for our
[01:18:18] aligned when making a decision factor your personal values and your organizations values into your decision
[01:18:25] making process strive to place the welfare and interests of your followers ahead of your own
[01:18:31] and and those are some things and actions that you can take to make this a reality and hey
[01:18:39] identify your own personal core values and write them down it's if something everybody should do
[01:18:42] um section here called cultivating trust and you you get in this situation where it's 1999
[01:18:56] 1999 you're going to lift the waneia let me go to the book here the country had regained its
[01:19:02] independence only about six years earlier it was going to be my job to work with the lift
[01:19:07] waneian military to help them understand how the US military function and grow the relationship
[01:19:11] between the US and Lithuania I would have a team of three other US military personnel represented
[01:19:17] their Marines army and air force and the team would also include one Lithuania army officer
[01:19:22] and three Lithuania civilians and this is your coming off I think you're coming off of the
[01:19:25] Italian command at this point so you were just done leading 800 people and now you got a team of
[01:19:31] seven you arrive in Lithuania for this job and I got to read this part after I was on board for a
[01:19:38] couple of weeks I began to come up with what I thought were some excellent ideas instead of tackling
[01:19:43] the work myself I gave began to shoot off yellow sticky notes to everyone giving them tasks to do
[01:19:48] I had plenty of bright ideas and I shot off plenty of taskers to them I thought I was making a
[01:19:52] great impression on the team because of my exceptional ideas however I could not explain it but
[01:19:57] something seemed to be a miss somehow I did not feel the team was comfortable under my leadership
[01:20:01] I had an army reserve major working on my team as an operations officer he was a bright guy
[01:20:05] with an analytical mind and positive demeanor one morning when I was sitting in my office he knocked
[01:20:10] on my door and asked if he could speak to me privately I brightened up I was all about this I thought
[01:20:15] to myself there is a young officer who needs advice from a sage like me the major sat down
[01:20:22] and I asked him what was on his mind his answer floored me he said sir you are tearing this team apart
[01:20:29] he went on to say that since I arrived Morales at an all-time low the team's perception of
[01:20:34] my leadership performance was 180 degrees from what I was hoping for their perception was not the
[01:20:40] boss as a sharp guy he has great ideas rather their perception was negative including such
[01:20:44] thoughts as the new boss thinks things are all screwed up here the new boss thinks we are all screwed
[01:20:48] up the new boss thinks we have nothing to do the new boss is not trust us knows the us versus
[01:20:53] him attitude that developed here this is definitely a lesson learned for me thankfully I had someone
[01:20:58] on the team with enough guts to discuss the issue with me I thank the major for the personal
[01:21:03] and moral courage you displayed by discussing the issue with me I had no idea that through my behavior
[01:21:08] and tone I was giving everyone such a negative perception of how I thought they were performing
[01:21:13] you go on here look fast for a little bit what I did to repair trust I immediately met with
[01:21:17] the team members and apologized for the mistake I made I took full ownership of creating a
[01:21:21] perception that I did not trust them I told them I trusted them completely I explained to them
[01:21:26] that I now realized how my behavior was negatively affecting the team I promised them I would change
[01:21:31] my behavior that's a good story yeah and the freaking battalion commander post post battalion commander
[01:21:39] rolling in the good idea fairy yeah we call that you know and and that taught me that whether you
[01:21:45] lead an organization of eight hundred or you lead an organization of eight the leadership challenges are
[01:21:52] there you know it doesn't it doesn't get any easier or harder depending on the number of people you
[01:21:58] lead you know you still got those challenges the the folks on your team are still expecting you to be a
[01:22:04] good leader a positive influence on them and as I mentioned in the book I'm just glad this this
[01:22:11] guy had the the personal courage to come up and and tell me about it because it was really it was
[01:22:18] really life changing for me because that really got me on a journey to really study what trust is all
[01:22:27] about and not only how to cultivate trust but also how to repair trust if if you unfortunately break it
[01:22:33] you know and one thing that is nice is luckily you must have given him some kind of impression
[01:22:40] that you were somewhat approachable and I can guarantee you there's the the the fitness reports of the
[01:22:48] world and evaluations are littered with people that decided they were going to go tell their boss hey
[01:22:52] this is what it looks like and they get scorched for it because the person didn't have an open mind
[01:22:56] and didn't really want to hear them so luckily you had an open mind and were humble enough to say oh
[01:23:04] that's not good I I made a mistake unfortunately the bosses that often times need that sort of
[01:23:12] personal guidance are the types of bosses that aren't open in that type of personal guidance unfortunately yeah
[01:23:18] yeah scary and I'm glad you I'm glad you complimented his moral courage yeah no I realized
[01:23:25] how hard that that was for him and and again I think that the you know the lesson for anybody
[01:23:31] out here listening is hey you know you could be you know you could be a jackass you know if you
[01:23:37] want to be and not be approachable and you know my way or the highway I'm the boss you know
[01:23:42] who are you to tell me what to do we're giving me advice but you're probably only on go so far
[01:23:49] and you know your journey as a leader and if you really want to have long-term success you've
[01:23:56] you've got to follow some of these basic leadership tenants you know
[01:24:02] next chapter what leadership is all about and and and you have a great combat story about
[01:24:09] what is it gunnery sergeant yeah gunnery sergeant Berkhar or master sergeant my heart
[01:24:13] he retired as a master sergeant I'll outstanding just a real real show occurred you can
[01:24:19] told the story on the last podcast you've recited with some more detail in here on the book just
[01:24:24] of a guy that just is unstoppable so I won't cover that right now get the book to read that story
[01:24:33] but you do say this about leadership effective leadership is measured by the results and
[01:24:37] organization achieves after all organizations exist to achieve their purpose and attain results
[01:24:43] leaders cannot attain results on their own leaders must enlist the support of their followers
[01:24:48] to be successful when leaders demonstrate to followers they care by placing their followers well
[01:24:53] fair ahead of their own that is a great way for the leader to gain follower support
[01:24:58] former army chief of staff general Gordon Sullivan in his book hope is not a method
[01:25:02] says our effectiveness as leaders is not so much what we do is as in what influence as what we
[01:25:10] influence others to do a leader must inspire others to be their best and to work toward achieving
[01:25:16] organizational objectives a leaders nothing without support of those here she leads using the
[01:25:22] model of character competence direction and overcoming adversity is a framework for enlisting
[01:25:26] and retaining support which will lead organizational results and success if you're doing your
[01:25:33] jobs a leader the the team is going to be doing what they're supposed to be doing yeah don't forget that
[01:25:39] and you know it's it's all about you know being fortunate enough to have people around you
[01:25:48] like like a gunny Michael Burkhard and one another quick story I want to tell that's not in the
[01:25:54] book I didn't mention it last time but I think it's inspiring we had this one soldier from the
[01:25:59] 28th infantry division who came to remind you with this his name was Anthony Jorgensen and again
[01:26:06] we got there in July of 2005 it was in the fall of 2005 he was in an uparmer come via
[01:26:13] Billy was in in the gunners position ID that Nate's causes his uparmer come via a flip over on
[01:26:21] its side he ends up having a broken arm and I think a broken leg both and so get sent back home
[01:26:27] to the United States recovers from his wounds and with sometime in early 2006 he tells the
[01:26:35] leadership in the Pennsylvania Guard hey I want to go back over to her body you know it's like
[01:26:40] they can't be a leave it's kind of like no we are not sending you back so I did have a battalion
[01:26:47] from the Vermont National Guard there with me task organized to my brigade so so this guy
[01:26:54] leaves a Pennsylvania National Guard joins the Vermont National Guard just so he could
[01:27:02] give Vermont to send them back over Remoddy be part of that battalion so he gets back over there
[01:27:07] and then it's April 2006 he's out there on another patrol and he's in a support by fire position
[01:27:15] he's in the the gunners compartment of this uparmer Humvee there's some dismounts going into a building
[01:27:21] that is they believed in surgeons were in and an insurgent fires an RPG a rock
[01:27:28] repelligernade at at this uparmer Humvee that Georgian's in his end and and just like wings it you know
[01:27:35] the slight damage to the Humvee he gets knocked down out of the the gunners hatch gets back up there
[01:27:42] he sees that insurgents are pinning down these dismounts that are out there so he jumps down into
[01:27:49] the driver's compartment drives that uparmer Humvee between where the insurgents are firing and these
[01:27:57] dismounts that were pinned down gets back up into the gunners compartment and lays down
[01:28:02] suppress the fire on these insurgents allowing these dismounts to the disengage and then continue to
[01:28:08] mission all this after suffering these wounds in that attack back in the fall now how many you know
[01:28:18] how many people would you know leave Remoddy with with you know honorable wounds like he did
[01:28:24] and then fight to get back over there and then you know does this heroic action which I believe
[01:28:30] he got a bronze star with V4 for for doing what he did but just just again the reason I want to
[01:28:37] bring that story up is these soldiers are so inspiring and you know we think as leaders we should be
[01:28:45] inspiring our followers but our followers have a way especially in the military of inspiring us and
[01:28:51] some of these stories just have to be told and the knee Jordan said what's he doing now do you know
[01:28:56] yeah he lives up in the scranton area and uh get the after to the scranton area yeah he is so just
[01:29:03] very proud of you know he does for 11 offhand I don't know right on yeah but uh well he
[01:29:10] used to loot you Anthony Jordanson yeah he needs that shout out what a beast yeah yeah I mean you
[01:29:16] get blown up by an ID and thrown out of your vehicle like you say oh he had these wounds you
[01:29:20] he's lucky to be alive after that happens yeah and then you get hit with an RPG
[01:29:27] you're lucky to be alive in home v yeah and again I hope he's playing the lottery up there
[01:29:32] Anthony Jordanson and scrant PA he's got a little some luck he's a guy I'd want you know watch
[01:29:39] him my back any anytime awesome awesome stuff here's an interesting title do not for a chapter
[01:29:47] do not treat everyone equally talk to us about that yeah basically with with that's about is you know
[01:29:57] I don't think leaders should treat everybody on the on the team equally you got and when I say
[01:30:05] that this one I mean by it you got to get to know the the people on your team everybody's a
[01:30:10] little bit different so you got to really get to know what makes them tick and and what's going
[01:30:16] to motivate certain people as opposed to motivating others and so you know you can't treat
[01:30:23] the meek well I think there's a story in there I think about Jimmy Johnson when he coached
[01:30:27] Dallas Cowboys and he was asked by reporter hey you know if if you saw Troy eight men a
[01:30:34] sleep in one of your team meetings and a third string offensive guard a sleep in in your
[01:30:41] team meeting would you treat them the same way and and he answered absolutely not he goes and
[01:30:47] this is what I do he goes I would probably cut that third string offensive guard immediately
[01:30:52] and would Troy eight men I would go up to him and I would kind of nudge him gently awake and I would
[01:30:56] say hey kind of bring a cup of coffee you know so the the point is you know you've got to understand
[01:31:02] the talent to have on your team and and not everybody should be treated equally you know some some
[01:31:07] some people need a kick in the butt some people need a pat on the back another interesting story
[01:31:14] with us a football story you know I I grew up as a green bay packer fan so in 1966 10 years old
[01:31:21] lumbarty you know winning his first super ball I became packer fan so I started to read all kinds
[01:31:27] of books about the packers and there was this one story you know Bart Star who was the quarterback
[01:31:31] for for lumbarty I think it was like the second year lumbarty was the head coach he was just
[01:31:38] chewing Bart Star out relentlessly during this practice and you know talk about moral courage
[01:31:44] after practice Bart Star goes to Coach lumbarty's office and he goes hey coach can I talk to
[01:31:50] privately for a few minutes coach says yeah sure what's up and Star says to him he goes coach he goes
[01:31:57] I don't want you ever chewing me out in front of the team again said I'm the quarterback
[01:32:03] I'm leading this team he goes if they see you chewing me out the way you were chewing me out
[01:32:08] he goes I'm not going to be able to lead this team effectively in the lumbarty light bulb
[01:32:13] an often said any realized he could not treat everybody exactly the same way you know so he never
[01:32:21] chewed Bart Star out in front of the team again because he realized that what Star said was exactly
[01:32:26] correct you know he couldn't lead the team effectively if he was going to be treated like that
[01:32:31] and so again just just some great lessons we could learn from from from past leaders and you know
[01:32:39] I just tried I think we all tried to do our best when we hear these lessons to try to apply
[01:32:43] them if we could you know that's when you when you get a guy like Vincent Barty in the
[01:32:46] reputation that he has and he's humble enough to think oh if he if he can be humble in that situation
[01:32:52] and maybe less than one of his subordinates and say oh he's right I'm wrong that's another indicator
[01:32:57] that you might want to stay humble as a leader you get some stuff to learn no matter who you are
[01:33:01] yeah absolutely you talked earlier about muddy boots leadership and and you tell a story
[01:33:06] and here about you got complimented on the fact that you were in charge but you you were
[01:33:11] your boots were muddy because you've been out in the field going to see and what was happening
[01:33:15] and and and that's a whole concept of getting the field get out there talk to people find
[01:33:20] what's going on in the front lines you say this here a mentor in that same chapter you say a
[01:33:26] mentor of mine told me the personal presence of a leader is probably the greatest key to influencing
[01:33:31] the action once a plan has been put in a motion a leaders presence demonstrates to one's
[01:33:36] followers the importance of the work at hand when the leader is where the action is they are then
[01:33:42] position to motivate others and make timely adjustments when necessary leader sometimes has to go
[01:33:49] to make things happen yeah you know I remember as a young army officer reading and some manual
[01:33:57] somewhere or maybe it was even some senior leader who was coaching me but said you know there's
[01:34:05] three things a commander could do to positively impact the battle once it begins he said the
[01:34:13] commanders use of fires you know close air support and direct fire the use of the reserves
[01:34:22] you know because usually the commander retains the authority of when to use his reserve and the
[01:34:28] third thing is personal presence on the battlefield and he said those are the three things a commander
[01:34:36] could do to influence the battle once it begins and and that always stuck to me stuck with me especially
[01:34:43] that notion of the personal presence on the battlefield and just having that personal presence there
[01:34:48] which help I think you know soldiers in battle or in a civilian sector you know employees in
[01:34:57] an organization realize that hey this leaders out with us sharing the load sharing the danger
[01:35:04] you know sharing what's coming our way and and you know they kind of get bolstered by that whole notion
[01:35:12] well I can attest to that I remember seeing you out on the battlefield the
[01:35:15] body looking over and say well there's the brigade commander I Roger that I guess he's I guess he's
[01:35:20] not sitting back in the talk all the time he's out here with the troops like you said seeing what's
[01:35:26] happening understanding what's happening and taking that risk I mean if you were in Ramadi
[01:35:31] and you were out in the city you were at risk and IEDs and and roadside bombs and RPGs and
[01:35:38] and machine guns don't they don't care what your name is they don't care what your rank is
[01:35:42] they'll they'll kill you one way or the other if they want to yeah you know I did try to get out
[01:35:46] there a lot not because I had any type of you know courage to speak of but just because I felt
[01:35:52] it was necessary to do and the other thing for any military leader listening to this and
[01:35:59] and really it applies to business leaders too I would encourage my staff to get out there
[01:36:05] and and the reason I encourage my staff to get out there is because I felt it was important for my
[01:36:10] staff to also gain ground truth if if if the staff was gaining with they thought was to truth
[01:36:18] from reading reports they were missing about 80% of what was happening so although I know you know
[01:36:24] in the military a lot of times especially in operations like that the staff needs to be back
[01:36:29] doing staff work I always encourage them that hey they they did have to make time to actually get
[01:36:36] out there talk to troops see areas with their own eyes and again just a history from lesson
[01:36:43] hurt and force 28th infantry division fighting in the hurt and forest in in November 1944 the battle
[01:36:50] of Schmidt was a devastating time for the 28th infantry division in about four days over 6,000
[01:36:59] casualties and one thing that was written about that period is it's said that general code
[01:37:05] to who is a division commander at the time most reports I read said he never even went as far
[01:37:11] forward as one of his regimental command posts and the staff did not go forward either so
[01:37:18] they didn't realize that the call trail through the hurt and forest which they were sending
[01:37:23] Sherman tank down Sherman tank is eight and a half feet wide the call trail was nine feet wide
[01:37:29] I mean it was not a good you know means you know MSR means supply route or or good route of any
[01:37:37] sort for those tanks to be going along and so to lessen there is because the commander didn't get
[01:37:43] out on the battlefield because the staff didn't get out there they were relying on maps
[01:37:47] they didn't get the full understanding of what that hurt and forest area was was like so
[01:37:55] again for any civilian leader any military leader absolutely important not only to get out
[01:38:00] there yourself but to get your your staff the ones that you depend on to advise you to get out there
[01:38:05] as well you know there's another piece of this when when you are the leader and you what
[01:38:10] you're supposed to be doing is you're supposed to be detached you're not supposed to go out there
[01:38:13] and get in the firefighter not supposed to go out there and and run the marketing meeting or meet
[01:38:17] with the client necessarily or get and start manufacturing stuff on the line you're supposed to
[01:38:23] go out and look do you do you maybe do a couple moves on the manufacturing line to make sure you
[01:38:28] understand what's happening yes but you don't start manufacturing things you come in from a
[01:38:33] different perspective you come in with a different perspective and then what you have to look for
[01:38:38] as a leader is you have to make sure that things are going in the right direction and the
[01:38:44] test that you should put on yourself is like it the basically the momentum is the momentum that
[01:38:50] we're going in correct because the momentum could be wrong and the momentum could be right and
[01:38:56] if the momentum is right cool you can just get out of the way if the momentum is wrong that's
[01:39:01] we're going to have to step in and stop it and and one of the places where you see this is
[01:39:04] well in combat when things lag you know you get an element that's not moving as quickly as they're
[01:39:10] supposed to move they're lagging they're moving too slow and they don't even realize that they can't
[01:39:16] realize it because they're doing it you can come in and say hey we got to step it up hey we need to
[01:39:19] push that next building so when that when an element is lagging a leader can step in and move things
[01:39:25] quicker and they should because that's the the momentum is inertia the momentum is hey we're going
[01:39:31] slow we're being methodical but they need to move faster the leaders got to make that happen there's
[01:39:35] also times the leader steps in and says hey need to slow down guys are moving too quick you guys are
[01:39:40] taking you not not taking too many risks slow it down so there's all these situations where I think
[01:39:46] what the leader needs to be cognizant cognizant of in their mind when they step into these situations
[01:39:52] is the momentum we have is the crowd is the mob moving in the right direction if they are great
[01:39:58] get out of their way let them keep going but if they're not that's when your opportunity comes to
[01:40:02] a straighten it out and check it yeah it's not and it's not just about speed it's about tempo and
[01:40:09] a couple of things came to mind Jaco as you were talking one is my personal security detachment
[01:40:16] in Ramadi you know it was generally for a farmer at home v's I had a platoon the platoon leaders
[01:40:22] named Ajax myth just just an excellent leader and early on as we were out there with me
[01:40:31] being transported by this when we when we moved mounted by this for a farmer humv formation
[01:40:41] you know I was kind of on the radio directing the movement of these for a farmer humv and
[01:40:46] and uh... joc Smith you know to be telling you looks at me goes sir he goes you're you're leading
[01:40:52] the brigade because let me lead this platoon and i and i said you know why joc you're exactly
[01:40:57] right i'm gonna shut up you know we're out when i when we're out here this is your platoon you're
[01:41:02] going to lead it i'm going i'm not going to say a damn word about how how you should maneuver this
[01:41:08] platoon because he was right i had i had a brigade lead and the other story is command sergeant major
[01:41:14] uh... crisp capillary was my command sergeant major when i commanded twenty-eighth infantry
[01:41:19] division uh he used to say uh as he would go out and talk to the leaders and coach and mentor
[01:41:25] leaders he would he would say leaders could stop things from getting screwed up just by the fact
[01:41:32] that they were there just by their mere presence uh so you know that's why it's so important again
[01:41:38] you know for for leaders to get out there because people are going to do the right thing
[01:41:44] and adhere to those standards when they know to leader is is there uh i was uh down in florida
[01:41:53] uh a while back doing some leadership training for a sheriff's department down there and one of the
[01:41:58] the deputy sheriff's was speaking to a group of corporals and he told the story how in the in the
[01:42:04] in the jail there uh how uh some deputies that should have been in the kitchen watching the
[01:42:13] prisoners do what they were doing uh you know cooking the meal uh just neglected to be there as
[01:42:20] they should and things really got out of hand and his point was just because the sergeant
[01:42:28] wasn't going down and checking to make sure those deputies were doing the right thing they
[01:42:33] you know the human beings are just decided hey you know this must be that important because
[01:42:37] nobody's checking on us so we're not going to be doing the right thing and so his point was again
[01:42:42] just by the mere fact of a leader being present they're going to fix things just by being there
[01:42:48] this is a reminds me of of another chapter in the book here chapter 11 an organization's personality
[01:42:55] say in 1985 i took command of an infantry company in the 28th infantry division Pennsylvania National
[01:43:00] Guard the infantry company i commanded was designated alpha company second battalion hundred and
[01:43:04] ninth infantry and the unit had an authorized strength of 144 soldiers i was honored to have an
[01:43:09] opportunity to lead the commission officers non-commission officers and soldiers assigned to the
[01:43:13] outfit i remembered reading an army leadership manual earlier in the in my career before taking this
[01:43:18] command in the manual there was a statement i will never forget it's at a military unit
[01:43:23] and any organization for that matter takes on the personality of its leader when reading that
[01:43:29] statement as a young inexperienced leader i doubted it i could not believe a unit of almost 150 soldiers
[01:43:35] would take on my personality i did not believe someone like me could have that type of impact
[01:43:40] whereby over a hundred of the people assigned would take on my traits based on my experience
[01:43:46] commanding that company i learned i was wrong and the leadership manual is correct and organization
[01:43:51] will take on the personality of its leader in my case the commander i took over for was a good man
[01:43:56] however his focus seemed to be more on being a nice guy than on emphasizing physical fitness and
[01:44:01] tough training that was exactly what the person personality of the unit was when i took command everyone
[01:44:06] got along have no comfortable but many of the soldiers were laxed on their fitness levels and the
[01:44:10] unit did not go in the field much to conduct rigorous training i believe soldiers need to be
[01:44:14] an excellent physical condition and i also believed infantry soldiers needed to train rigorously
[01:44:18] in field conditions be experts with their weapons and take excellent care of their equipment
[01:44:22] over time the unit took on a tough persona this was ratified by our brigade commander when
[01:44:27] he selected our unit train at the national training center at fort or when california
[01:44:32] late nineteen eighty this is a big deal and an honor for national guard company to be selected
[01:44:36] for that training so there you go yeah the case in point yeah the the next section i wanted to just
[01:44:43] jump into and it's called decision making and there's some tap some topics in here and that
[01:44:47] you write about and i just want to kind of do a high level review of some of these some of these
[01:44:55] uh sections one of them's hit the ground running um which means when you show up get started
[01:45:04] get your butt in gear yeah yeah another one's character is foundational again this is what we're
[01:45:10] doing what we're doing this is who we are and if we don't have good character hey listen
[01:45:17] if you don't have good character you might be able to get away with it for a little while you might
[01:45:20] even be able to weasel out a promotion because you you maneuvered and you manipulated it and
[01:45:26] you took credit where you didn't and you didn't give credit to the team or you still you might
[01:45:30] you might even get a promotion you might even get two promotions they can happen but eventually
[01:45:35] it's not it's not gonna last no no you know uh a friend of mine lend me a rella
[01:45:41] he graduated from west point in like nineteen fifty eight or something uh retired as a colonel and
[01:45:47] the army he wrote this book uh about character and in the book he would go and interview different
[01:45:54] leaders who were known to be character based leaders and one of the people he interviewed was coach
[01:46:00] Krishewski coach K from Duke and uh in the in this interview he was doing with coach K you know
[01:46:08] lend lends to coach K like what this character have to do with winning a basketball game
[01:46:13] and coach K's answer was you know character has absolutely nothing at all to do with winning a
[01:46:22] basketball game but it has everything to do with winning a championship you know and exactly what
[01:46:31] you said you know you might have a win here there if you're not character based but if you want to
[01:46:35] be a champion if you want to have long term success you got to be a character based leader at least
[01:46:40] that's where I believe um another sub headline here is know your job and do your job and this
[01:46:47] I might might know that I took on this one it is there is such a thing as a stupid question
[01:46:53] and when we explain the you people always say oh there's no such thing as a stupid question
[01:46:56] if you show up to a job and you're gonna be in charge of a tank and you say hey what's the
[01:47:04] name of this vehicle how far can this gun shoot how many rounds can we get a if you're asking
[01:47:09] questions that you should have done some research and know when you showed up you're wrong if you
[01:47:13] show up to a manufacturer to run a manufacturing plant and you show up and say hey what is it
[01:47:18] we're making or how many employees do we have or who's in charge of the day shift if you're
[01:47:23] asking questions that a little bit of research could have answered that you didn't do a good job
[01:47:27] prepare you don't you so know your job that's my part of know your job there is stupid questions
[01:47:32] don't show up your first day and ask stupid questions that you should have known if you're
[01:47:36] taking an ounce of effort to to figure out what was happening you know you're exactly right I mean
[01:47:43] you got to put forth some of that effort now if it's some type of you know in a you know technical
[01:47:49] you know in a thing that maybe a guy with ten years experience would know and you wouldn't know
[01:47:53] hey that's that's fine and you can ask those questions all day long yeah yeah but it's just showing
[01:47:57] you really don't care if you didn't you know take the time to do that type of research before
[01:48:03] coming into job for sure you say take on tough assignments and this is there's a this is this is
[01:48:10] just a good thing across the board you're going to learn a lot you're going to show everyone that
[01:48:15] you don't you'll take the not just the tough ones but the crappy ones hey no one wants to work this
[01:48:20] weekend cool I got it hmm one of my buddies uh sestone who's in romadi with us he was he was on a
[01:48:28] ship he was a ship driver in the navy and they had his his department got assigned to do some cleaning
[01:48:35] like they hadn't been in port for a while and his department got assigned to clean whatever
[01:48:40] and uh I heard this after he died someone the story got passed to his brother was uh you know
[01:48:47] at as his department was leaving for liberty they looked up and they saw he was cleaning whatever
[01:48:54] it was they were assigned to clean and he had just said you know what I'm gonna let the guys go
[01:48:58] and go on liberty and I'm gonna do whatever meanial task we've been told to do and he was the
[01:49:02] guy in charge of the department so do the do the tough ones do the crappy ones too yeah yeah and again
[01:49:07] you know all in line would hit the ground running you know a lot of people say don't volunteer for
[01:49:11] anything right you know I think that's a big mistake tell me you you you you got a volunteer to take
[01:49:16] on those tough things and and when you do that you know a couple of benefits first of all nobody's
[01:49:22] gonna expect you to succeed if you're just starting it you're you know out in your career you know
[01:49:29] you're not gonna have high expectations if you're just starting out and so by tackling those
[01:49:34] tough things gaining that experience you know it's just like you know in the military you know a
[01:49:39] second lieutenant army to lowest ranking commissioned officer you're expecting a second lieutenant to
[01:49:44] make a mistake you know so that's the time to take on those tough assignments gain that experience
[01:49:51] make some of those mistakes learn from them and you know hopefully have the right leaders
[01:49:57] guiding you along the way and that that's how you're really gonna get off to a good start and be
[01:50:01] successful another one developed your leadership philosophy early but continue to refine
[01:50:08] and this is once again important even Vince Lombardi refined his philosophy
[01:50:12] that's what you need to do come up with a philosophy but then refine it make it better as time goes on
[01:50:21] next section here is his competence and I don't know if you did this on purpose but some of
[01:50:27] your chapter titles have a little bit of you know that you're gonna get some rise out of some
[01:50:32] people this one's not everyone deserves a mentor yeah kind of did that on purpose what do you
[01:50:37] be right that one you know and again this gets back to an infantry conference I was at
[01:50:45] in general cone you know he since passed away but he was I think the trade-ock commander at the time
[01:50:52] speaking to us there and he basically said that during his remarks and it's like wow you know that
[01:50:58] kind of hit me you know like like a brick hit in me in the face it's like well what's he talking about
[01:51:02] but but what he went on to say and which what I have you know come to to see as true is
[01:51:12] you know not everybody deserves a mentor because if you're not out there actively looking for a
[01:51:17] mentor for somebody to you know somebody's example to follow you probably don't deserve a mentor and I
[01:51:23] remember even as a as a young officer thinking you know hey nobody's mentoring me you know what
[01:51:29] what's up with this you know and I was expecting some you know gray beard you know to sit me down
[01:51:35] at their side and tell me all the facts of how to lead but hey that that doesn't happen
[01:51:41] and then I realized mentorship is happening all around us all we got to do is look for it for it so
[01:51:47] again if you're a young executive in a company you know and you're observing how
[01:51:56] one of the senior leaders in that company is acting how they're talking to people how they're
[01:52:04] relating to people and you're learning the good and the bad from that that's actually mentorship
[01:52:10] and you know mentorship is all around us if we just look just look for it but nobody should expect
[01:52:16] somebody to kind of sit us down and tell us about hey these these are the things you really
[01:52:21] got to look out for that that's that realistic that's just just not going to happen
[01:52:29] know it is not uh chapter 18 this one's always a big topic getting buy in
[01:52:37] Napoleon used a technique to obtain buy in it was the same technique used by the union general
[01:52:44] who commanded the army of the platomic at Gettysburg general meat meat was a disciple of Napoleon
[01:52:50] the technique was called a war council on July 2nd 1863 mead brought his lieutenant into his
[01:52:57] makeshift headquarters at the lifester house he had in a agenda that evening the council had
[01:53:03] to provide their recommendations on one of three courses of action mead would have to decide one
[01:53:11] the union army should leave the battlefield to the union army should stay in fight and offensive
[01:53:16] battle three the union army should stay and fight a defensive battle mead began by asking his
[01:53:23] lower ranking and least experienced lieutenant to voice their opinions first he used this method
[01:53:28] because he knew if the more senior officer spoke first more junior officers in terms of rank
[01:53:33] reputation or experience might feel too intimidated to disagree after all this was by design a
[01:53:40] hierarchical organization mead knew he had to get the lower ranking leaders to speak first in order
[01:53:46] to get their unvarnished thoughts after everyone spoke mead decided the union would stay in fight
[01:53:52] a defensive battle the rest as they say is history the union army was victorious and won the
[01:53:57] battle and would go on to win the war although would take another bloody two years before the
[01:54:01] Confederate army laid down their arms I when when people asked me this question how do you get
[01:54:11] people to buy into the plan I say let them come up with a plan you don't have to worry about
[01:54:16] buying anymore you don't have to worry about you came up with it I'm buying into your plan
[01:54:21] and I can do that easily I can control my own thoughts and if you come if John comes up with a
[01:54:26] plan that's pretty decent I'm cool with it and and we'll go with it yeah yeah you know as a leader
[01:54:34] I found you know give the task give the purpose but don't give the how you know give the what
[01:54:39] and the why but not the how and usually you know those people who work for us are going to figure
[01:54:46] out a better way to do with them we would have figured out so yeah you know let them run with it
[01:54:52] in any organization usually those people with a grassroots level have they're they're closer to the
[01:55:00] problem set so turn it over to them now yeah you might have to provide a little bit of guidance
[01:55:05] you might have to you know kind of you know just just adjust one way or other but essentially
[01:55:14] you know give me them the what and why and let them figure out the how is generally the best
[01:55:18] way to handle it and I'll get leaders say well what if my what if my support has come up with a
[01:55:22] stupid plan I'm gonna say well it's wrong with you if you've got support instead of coming up with a
[01:55:25] stupid plan yeah I'll tell you what's wrong you haven't trained them properly you haven't given the
[01:55:29] the right mentorship and guidance you haven't let them come up with plans before so they could learn
[01:55:33] how to plan better so if they come up with a stupid plan what do you do you start asking them some
[01:55:38] earnest questions about their plan and kind of it reveals to them what some of the holes in their
[01:55:42] plan are and then they can make adjustments and while they're making adjustments they're also learning
[01:55:47] so the next time you ask them asking them to come up with a plan it's may not be a brilliant plan
[01:55:52] but at least it's less stupid than the first plan and you look up in three months or six months
[01:55:56] all of a sudden their planning is outstanding you look up an ear and they're probably planning
[01:56:00] better than you are because like you said they're the ones that are closest to the problem yeah
[01:56:03] and you know what you said a little bit earlier I think is exactly true you know sometimes
[01:56:08] you know our followers will come up with a plan that isn't exactly the way we would do it
[01:56:13] but you know I let them run with it anyway you know as long as you know it's not flawed in any
[01:56:18] way it's just a different way than I would have thought of doing it and and I think that's really where
[01:56:23] leaders have to leave their ego at the door you know to say you know hey this isn't the way I do it
[01:56:29] but it's going to get the job done it's still going to be cost effective or you know whatever
[01:56:32] the case might be so so let them go forward with it and it's you know like you said you don't have
[01:56:38] to worry about the buying if they came up with that I go into every meeting with my subordinates
[01:56:42] when I was in a pool tune when I was a task in a commander right now in the business world I walk
[01:56:47] into a meeting with my people my goals to use their plan that's my goal I don't want to use
[01:56:52] whatever I'm coming up with I want to use theirs and if you have that goal at the beginning
[01:56:56] that's going to lead you to the best possible place and look like you said if their plan is
[01:57:00] dumb which which you know you get to people come up with some dumb plans occasionally
[01:57:05] but occasionally some people come up with some dumb ideas that's okay ask them some earnest questions
[01:57:09] and they're going to see that their plan is the reality of their plan which is dumb yeah yeah
[01:57:14] and and you know this kind of leads into the whole you know asking your followers with their
[01:57:20] recommendation is and you know some some followers are going to come up with some type of crazy
[01:57:25] recommendation that you're just no longer your experience it ain't going to work but I think
[01:57:31] what leaders need to do is then get back with those followers and explain to the follower hey
[01:57:37] this is why I didn't use your recommendation now again I'm you know talking about situations where
[01:57:43] there's time to have those conversations you know if you're in the middle of the firefight
[01:57:47] you know you got to sometimes a you know go left not right whatever but I'm just saying you know
[01:57:52] and and most situations where you're asking for recommendations on some type of long-term plan
[01:57:58] you're putting together somebody comes up with something wet you know that's really wacko
[01:58:03] and you're not going to use it I do think you show people the respect by at least getting back
[01:58:08] with them and explaining to them why I'm not going to use your plan yeah because that's it
[01:58:12] you're it's also your opportunity to teach them why that plan wasn't good and again I'll do it
[01:58:16] by just by saying hey John I want to ask you about you know this this channelized area that you
[01:58:21] want to take your patrol through do you think that's the best approach to the target going through
[01:58:25] this valley where there's elevated positions on both sides that could be occupied by the enemy
[01:58:30] and you'll look at me and say you know I'm possibly get back to you and you'll come up with a different
[01:58:35] plan exactly um fast forward a little bit you got a section in here talking about tactical patience
[01:58:43] which is a concept everybody needs and I think it's the younger you are the morning you need to
[01:58:48] understand tactical patience because the younger you are the less tactical patience you generally
[01:58:53] have and that goes all the way to like little children that are four years old they have the least
[01:58:58] amount of tactical patience so you talk about that but what I like here is you also throw in a
[01:59:02] section that is is called what tactical patience is not demonstrating tactical patience is not about
[01:59:09] putting off a decision it is about taking the time when you have the luxury of having time
[01:59:14] to think through the information available and the recommendations before deciding just as nothing
[01:59:19] happened in business before somebody sells something nothing happens in business until the leader decides
[01:59:25] good leaders have to have the courage to make a decision with less than perfect information
[01:59:32] so it's good to be tactical repation but also there comes a time where you got to make a call
[01:59:38] yeah absolutely and you know jack well you know the CEO at general electric for for 20 years
[01:59:46] I think from like 81 until 2001 you know he he wrote in one of his books that the problem he saw
[01:59:54] with middle-level managers throughout general electric is the the unsuccessful ones were the ones
[02:00:00] who did not have the courage to make a decision and again when you make a decision you're putting
[02:00:05] yourself out there and and some leaders just don't want to take that you know that risk to put
[02:00:12] themselves out there and and potentially make the wrong decision but it's so important because again
[02:00:20] once you make a decision that doesn't mean that you have to stick by that decision no matter what you know
[02:00:26] you've got to assess what's going on you know get some feedback about what's actually happening
[02:00:32] out there you know the real deal and then you know make those adjustments as you go but anybody
[02:00:37] who thinks that hey once I made this decision I can't I can't deviate from it I don't think that's a
[02:00:42] good technique yeah that's a technique that I talk about in leadership strategy tactics
[02:00:47] book is I call it a derivative decision making I'm going to make the smallest decisions I can
[02:00:52] you know you want me to go a salt to part of the city of Ramadi I say hey got it boss
[02:00:57] we're going to take one building we're going to start with this one little building over here and see how
[02:01:01] that goes and if like we get a good foothold and now we can put some troops in a good spot now I
[02:01:05] can go to the next building I don't send you know all my troops and a bunch of different buildings
[02:01:10] at the same time no I'm going to make small steps in that direction and and then it's very easy
[02:01:15] for me to make adjustments it's a very easy for me to say oh you know what hey boss I'm going to need
[02:01:18] more troops or hey boss this doesn't make sense right now there's his way more fortified than we
[02:01:23] thought it was going to be whatever the case maybe I can make adjustments but I start off by making
[02:01:27] very small decisions and then adjusting and the other thing that that I was thinking about what you
[02:01:31] were saying that is when you were talking about Jack Welch and the middle-level managers failing
[02:01:38] to make decisions because they don't want to put themselves out there and this reminds me of what
[02:01:42] you were talking about earlier and what's in the book the idea of forming like scar tissue and
[02:01:47] and the habit if you get in the habit of saying hey look I made a decision wasn't the best call
[02:01:53] my it's on me here's the adjustment we're going to make once you realize that that doesn't
[02:01:58] it's not the end of the world to do that now I can tell you can you can you do that to an extent
[02:02:03] where people go they they jocquoise just nothing but bad decisions and every decision he makes
[02:02:07] because hey my mistake hey this one is my mistake hey sorry guys this was my mistake eventually
[02:02:11] you're going to lose some credibility you can't just make bad decisions all the time but if you
[02:02:16] make decisions hey even what is it a a broken clock is right twice a day you're going to be right
[02:02:22] some of the times you know if you're doing a good assessment you make a decision and it turns out to be wrong
[02:02:27] hey guys sorry my fault that we should have gone in different directions here's the adjustment we're
[02:02:31] making people don't lose respect for you they gain respect for you but if you don't experience that
[02:02:36] and you don't build up the muscle of making a decision owning the outcome whether it's good or bad
[02:02:42] only outcome you can build up a muscle memory for doing that where it becomes habitual and it's okay
[02:02:49] and I think if you never if you never step into that arena you're you're just scared of it you know
[02:02:56] it's like Mikey in the dragons all the kids book I wrote the the the the the kids scared of the
[02:03:00] dragons you didn't realize the dragons are small and that's true with most things we fear so if you
[02:03:05] don't open that door going that cave and make a decision occasionally you're never going to understand
[02:03:11] that there's a once you do that if it was a bad decision just own it make adjustments and move forward
[02:03:17] you need to learn that you need to feel that and you can get used to it yeah and you know
[02:03:22] jocca I was listening to an interview you were participating in once and I think you said something to
[02:03:27] affect that every every problem is a leadership problem and and you know with that gets to is
[02:03:34] you know leaders have to create an environment where subordinates feel comfortable taking the risk to
[02:03:40] make a decision and no hey if it doesn't turn out exactly right at least you know I'm not going to
[02:03:44] get my legs chopped out from underneath me so you know it's really important that you know if you
[02:03:50] if you're a leader and and you see that you've got subordinates who are hesitant to make a decision
[02:03:57] maybe you should look in the mirror and think to yourself hey what am I doing to create an
[02:04:01] environment where these these people are afraid to even even decide or make a mistake that that's
[02:04:06] not a good environment a horrible environment and you're going to end up uh your team is going to fail
[02:04:10] eventually yeah um fast forward a little bit chapter 25 iron sharpens iron as iron sharpens iron so
[02:04:19] one person sharpens another proverbs 27 17 and this is right in line with what you were just talking
[02:04:28] about demonstrate initiative and attribute I felt strongly about was initiative at every level of
[02:04:34] leadership throughout the division and this is again this is when you were in a you know leadership
[02:04:39] position this was a result of my combat experience in Romadi Iraq I saw during my time in
[02:04:44] Romadi how it was essential that junior leaders demonstrated initiative in order to get ahead
[02:04:50] of the decision making loop of our enemies I believed if we did not encourage initiative in steady
[02:04:56] state operations at training exercise subordinate leaders would not display the necessary level
[02:05:01] of initiative when in combat I put out written guidance and I continually reinforced stating I believe
[02:05:06] demonstrating high levels of initiative was worth the risk of making honest mistakes so this is
[02:05:13] exactly what you were just talking about if you've got a team that's not making decisions you're you're
[02:05:19] you're the problem and the way you the way you instilled that culture inside your division when you
[02:05:26] were division commander was by talking about it by putting out written guidance by demonstrating it
[02:05:31] and I like this this point of the fact that initiative is worth the risk of making honest
[02:05:39] mistakes that's a huge deal if you're a subordinate leader and you know that the boss wants you
[02:05:44] to take initiative and that it is worth the risk of making honest mistakes that's that could be a
[02:05:50] game changer for a young leader yeah you know I think that's an important statement uh there
[02:05:56] about you know demonstrating initiative is worth the risk of making honest mistakes but
[02:06:01] the caveat to that is if you're a leader and you put that statement out there guess what your
[02:06:06] subordinates are going to be looking for they're going to be looking for the first time
[02:06:11] somebody demonstrates initiative and makes it honest mistake and they're going to they're going to
[02:06:14] they're going to be a martiala yeah they're going to be a watch it see how how do you react to this thing
[02:06:19] and actually I think it was my sergeant major you know Chris Kepner who mentioned that to me
[02:06:25] after I put that statement he oh he goes you know people are going to be watching to see
[02:06:29] are you react the first time somebody makes an honest mistake by demonstrating initiative
[02:06:33] and that was a little you know some good counsel from him so again leaders again to
[02:06:40] to develop and cultivate this trust and organization they put something out there
[02:06:44] now they really have to pay attention to make sure that they you know they they walk that the
[02:06:51] talk there and and and and do what they said they're going to do because people are going to be
[02:06:55] watching nobody's going to be leaving nobody's going to believe that written word until they
[02:07:00] actually see an action fast forward here you've talking about some of the internal attributes
[02:07:10] says if leaders cannot get in touch with their own feelings they will have difficulty
[02:07:14] understanding the feelings of others leaders must practice self awareness and mindfulness
[02:07:19] once one develops self-worth and you talk about I'm I'm fast forward a little bit you talk about
[02:07:25] journaling is a good technique like writing down what your thoughts what your feelings are
[02:07:29] so that you get some perspective on them I'm going to fast forward a little bit um once one
[02:07:34] develop self awareness one can then become better at controlling emotions followers look to
[02:07:40] leaders to be able to get things get stable when things get chaotic controlling ones emotions
[02:07:46] has many personal organizational and societal benefits I remember when I was young I was a young
[02:07:52] inexperienced leader I acted out in front of a group of my followers showing great displeasure
[02:07:58] not with them but with a situation we were dealing with I ran to didn't rave and threw my
[02:08:02] notebook across the room as an inexperienced leader I thought this would demonstrate to my followers
[02:08:07] followers I was all in instead when I saw the negative reaction of my followers I realized this was
[02:08:13] a poor technique you remember what happened what made you so mad yeah it was actually I was
[02:08:19] a lieutenant on active duty commanding a platoon and I can't remember the actual incident that made
[02:08:27] me upset but it was something that was upsetting to our to our unit don't put you in god
[02:08:34] weekend duty or something like that something you know and I thought okay I'm going to show
[02:08:38] my I really you know care care about this and acted out and I realized that they were they were
[02:08:45] not looking for a leader to act like that they were looking for a leader to act professional more
[02:08:51] stable and and I think I might either wrote in that book or somewhere else that they were looking
[02:08:58] for a rock instead of what they got was a pile of sand you know and you know that that really taught
[02:09:05] me that you know it's it's kind of like being a parent you know kids aren't looking for friends
[02:09:11] they're looking for parents you know and and supportants aren't looking for for buddies they're
[02:09:16] looking for followers that think of count on and it'd be be a father and the other thing is I
[02:09:22] like to say is that leaders don't need to be great all the time but they need to be great
[02:09:28] when it makes a difference they need to be great when it matters you know because you know let's
[02:09:32] face it you know steady state operations 80% of the time think 90% of the time things are kind
[02:09:38] of moving along right you know but then you hit this bump into road and that's where you really
[02:09:43] got to stand up and you got to be a leader and you've got to show that that ability to control
[02:09:49] your emotions and to be stable because that that that is something that creates confidence and
[02:09:56] organization a full leader falls apart like that then then heck this ordinance don't have anybody
[02:10:04] to count on because even the leaders start to crumble that that's not a good thing so that happened
[02:10:08] on early on that happened early on in my career and I realized what a mistake that was so I was always
[02:10:13] very very cognizant of the fact that hey yeah yeah you had a you had a show strength when things were
[02:10:21] kind of caving in all around you that's that's what that's where your sports are expecting
[02:10:25] I always looked at it if my leader couldn't control his emotions how the heck is it going to be
[02:10:30] able to make good decisions and I was remembered I saw when I was younger some of the leaders I had
[02:10:35] would fly off the handle and I just think well I was just gonna make good decisions no one makes a
[02:10:40] good decision when they're emotional no displaying empathy empathy is an essential element of being a
[02:10:47] servant leader empathetic leaders can sense what their followers are feeling this eliminates tone
[02:10:52] deafness and the perception leaders do not understand or worse yet the perception the leader does not
[02:10:58] care when followers think a leader does not care they will stop bringing forth their problems and
[02:11:03] issues empathy is the capacity to show followers you care about them a leader must understand how
[02:11:09] followers feel and what their issues are in order to provide their resources allowing followers to
[02:11:14] do their job more effectively and increase the probability of mission accomplishment you want to see
[02:11:21] the perspective of the people on your team and you know I think it was Colin Powell who said
[02:11:26] something to the effect that when when a soldier's stop bringing you their problems you've effectively
[02:11:33] stopped being a leader and you know you could apply that to you know civilian sectors well
[02:11:38] when you're the people who worked for you stop bringing you problems you you've really effectively
[02:11:44] lost your ability to to lead them because you know folks are gonna stop bringing us their
[02:11:51] problems when they figure either you can't do anything about it or you just don't care enough
[02:11:59] to do anything about it and and and and that's just a terrible position for for a leader to be in
[02:12:08] yeah you gotta you gotta maintain that connection as always a running joke whenever I'm in a
[02:12:12] leadership position that no one ever tells me that they're tired that they don't want to work
[02:12:17] more it just never happens right so I always have to make sure that I'm pulling that string a
[02:12:22] little bit more than normal because no one wants to come and say hey jocke we've had enough we want
[02:12:28] to do and don't want to do another operation we don't want to go we've been on the road to no
[02:12:32] one ever wants to tell me that so I always have to make sure I'm digging a little bit deeper otherwise
[02:12:37] they won't say a damn thing uh section three is resilience and I'm gonna read a little section here
[02:12:46] our four up on our upper humvies launched themselves out of the gate of four operating base
[02:12:51] Ramadi on a sun drenched Sunday morning in September 2005 the heat was stifling the
[02:12:55] afraid is river running through our area added a high degree of humidity causing my eye protection
[02:13:00] and messed up with sweat we were traveling around around along route Michigan toward observation post
[02:13:06] hotel overlooking east Ramadi, O.P. hotel a suicide bomber attacked the observation post a few weeks
[02:13:13] earlier but failed to dislodge the tenacious soldiers who operated out of there I wanted to check
[02:13:18] on the soldiers and gauge their morale our vehicles made their way through the city through a
[02:13:24] city struggling due to the violent insurgency there still as we made our way east toward east Ramadi
[02:13:30] the streets were busy with vehicle and pedestrian traffic I was happy to have my brigade
[02:13:34] chaplain riding along with me in the backseat of our vehicle and the army I've always been a big fan
[02:13:39] of our chaplains these warriors of a higher power could bolster the spirit of soldiers anytime they
[02:13:44] visited a unit the chaplain was also part of my personal staff and I valued their insight prior
[02:13:50] to making the decision affecting the well well fair of soldiers after our visit to O.P. hotel we made
[02:13:56] our back our way back through the center of the city the chaplain noticed the same thing eye
[02:14:01] into every soldier and our mounted patrol noticed the vehicles and pedestrians covering the streets
[02:14:08] about two hours earlier had disappeared there was a strange quietness clothing the neighborhood
[02:14:15] we were passing through we had seen this before we embraced ourselves for an insurgent attack
[02:14:22] we all became a bit tense as our senses were alerted the banter we usually engaged in as we moved
[02:14:28] about the city was quieted as we gave the alleys and buildings around us our full attention
[02:14:36] in order to calm down our crew the chaplain announced an allowed voice fair not boys God is with us
[02:14:45] the young specialist operating out of the gunners compartment of our vehicle heard the chaplains
[02:14:50] announcement and from his more exposed position atop the vehicle he playfully called down to the
[02:14:55] chaplain God maybe with you all down there but he certainly is not up here with me
[02:15:02] about 20 seconds later we heard the boom of a rocket propelled grenade the grenade squarely hit the
[02:15:08] armor shield surrounding our young gunner and harmlessly ricocheted into the air before
[02:15:14] exploding and causing no harm to personnel and no damage to equipment our stunned gunner did not
[02:15:21] miss a beat he quickly and loudly proclaimed I stand corrected chaplain God just arrived
[02:15:29] of course we all broke up with laughter it was good having the chaplain with us that day
[02:15:34] and this is a section that you've got called spiritual fitness talkers about spiritual fitness
[02:15:41] yeah you know you know when we talk about fitness of course you know we think of physical fitness
[02:15:47] and you know mental fitness emotional fitness but I think spiritual fitness is a big part of helping
[02:15:53] us develop our leadership strength and that's whether we are part of some type of formal
[02:16:02] you know religion or whether we just are connected to our spirituality in another way you know
[02:16:10] through nature through meditation whatever the case it's it's important that we understand
[02:16:16] that there's something I this my own person I believe there's something large we're going on
[02:16:22] and universal round this it's not all about us you know we're just just just just a speck
[02:16:27] of everything that's going on and I think that helps us keep grounded I think it keeps it helps us
[02:16:32] keep humble and and I think it again kind of aligns with whatever values we say or a personal
[02:16:39] values where it will help us stay on the right track as as we're making these these decisions so
[02:16:48] I think if if leaders don't take the time to reflect on the the notion that there's a higher
[02:16:56] power out there that there's something going on that's really much bigger than ourselves
[02:17:02] that they may be missing something and this that that's one part of this whole section of the book
[02:17:08] which is called Brazilians and this is one of your three overall themes and you got some other
[02:17:13] facets of resilience in here positive energy and that's an overused statement right and
[02:17:21] what I was thinking about when I was reading this is you can think of the positive energy as someone
[02:17:26] that's sort of like it's it's hard to understand or it can be hard to understand but if you think
[02:17:31] of people that have negative energy it's really easy to understand those people right it's really
[02:17:35] easy to understand those all this is never going to work all we're screwed all this is horrible
[02:17:39] you we all know people like that and it seems easier to identify maybe I shouldn't use the
[02:17:44] word hard to understand it can be hard to understand hard to identify someone that has positive energy
[02:17:49] it's really easy to there's more people it seems that have negative energy and occasionally
[02:17:55] it gets someone that's just got super positive and and then you'll remember that and you'll remember
[02:18:00] how they're you know what their response was when something was going wrong and how they
[02:18:04] took it and they look around back oh good we get another chance to go at this or whatever the
[02:18:08] case maybe so I think that's that's a good one you got fitness physical fitness in here
[02:18:13] which is again something that I get off and asked does that come from the military or is that just
[02:18:20] part of you and the answer is look there's plenty of people in the military that get out of the
[02:18:24] military and physical fitness their physical fitness fails yeah they get out of shape so it's not
[02:18:29] something that you get it's not a chip you get programmed you need to work at yeah and just
[02:18:35] going back to your your piece they're about the positive energy you know you mentioned those
[02:18:41] negative people I like to call them energy sponges because they just kind of sap the energy from
[02:18:46] everyone around them it's kind of like why do I want to be around this person man you know and
[02:18:51] it's just not good for a leader to be that way I like to say a leader should brighten up the
[02:19:00] room when they enter it not when they leave it you know if you're to type a leader the bright
[02:19:04] and zipper room when you leave it's kind of like man you're doing you're doing something wrong
[02:19:09] there so again it's not like you got to be you know all smiling and slapping people on the back
[02:19:15] and glad hand and people all the time but but people have to know that you're expecting tomorrow
[02:19:22] to be a better day than today and who doesn't want to be around a leader who believes that tomorrow
[02:19:27] is going to be better than today you know because you know we want to move forward and and that
[02:19:32] that's what I mean by by positive energy and like we talked about earlier in the podcast here
[02:19:39] you have to have an action plan a believable action plan you know if you want to be known as
[02:19:45] as a as a positive leader because people aren't going to to follow you if they just think you're
[02:19:50] glad handing everything and you really don't have a plan to back it up that's important yeah you
[02:19:54] got to you got to see a pathway to get this mission done yeah and see a way to get out of this
[02:20:00] miserable situation with that we're in and see a way to have some fun with it yeah yeah I mean
[02:20:05] hey you know the two men nature people want to be able to you know have people want to be
[02:20:10] able to enjoy their work you know and you know the old saying you know if you enjoy your work
[02:20:16] you're not going to work a day in your life and I truly believe that and and again you just
[02:20:21] got to find those things that really you know keep you motivated keep you excited about life
[02:20:26] what about vulnerability this is another thing that you clue into here um well well well
[02:20:32] talk to us about vulnerability from a leadership perspective yeah when I when I talk about vulnerability
[02:20:37] uh and we are to talk a little bit about the first part it's about uh having the courage to
[02:20:42] leave your comfort zone allowing yourself to be vulnerable to try something maybe you haven't
[02:20:47] tried before something that's a little bit hard but the other um aspects of vulnerability is
[02:20:56] putting yourself out there and exposing yourself to your followers and I'll tell you what I mean
[02:21:02] by that one way to expose yourself to your followers and I I think this is a helpful technique is
[02:21:08] sharing stories with your followers about times maybe when you tried something and you failed you
[02:21:15] know or or you made a mistake and uh the reason I think that's important is because you know
[02:21:22] followers look at at a leader the thing man they're in this position of leadership everything they
[02:21:27] touch in life must you know must have turned a goal they probably never made any mistakes so they
[02:21:31] want to be in this position of leadership and we know nothing could be farther from the truth so by
[02:21:37] by explaining to your followers how hey you know I've I've tried and I've failed sometimes and
[02:21:42] I've made mistakes and this is how is it able to overcome these mistakes that that inspires
[02:21:47] uh those followers and then the the other piece about vulnerability is having the humility
[02:21:54] to ask people on your team and I know you've written about this because I've read it but having
[02:21:59] the humility to ask people on your team what they think and how they would do something and then
[02:22:07] having the humility to follow through with their recommendation when you see it's a good
[02:22:11] recommendation that should be followed and and again not just having that attitude that
[02:22:16] hey I'm the leader you've only got two years on the job what could you possibly know you know
[02:22:21] more than I I know but again you don't know what a life experience that person had so
[02:22:26] asking people their opinion we talk about respect I think one of the best ways you could show
[02:22:31] somebody on your team that you respect them is by asking their opinion could you imagine working
[02:22:37] for somebody for ten years and you've never had that person you worked for ever ask you for your
[02:22:44] opinion I mean you know how how could that make you feel good and and how could that make you
[02:22:51] feel that that leader of yours respect you man you never even asked me what I thought you know
[02:22:56] so I think one of the best ways to show people your respect them is a asset opinion doesn't mean
[02:23:01] you have to follow the recommendation like we mentioned earlier and if you don't follow their
[02:23:05] recommendation a good technique is getting back with them and explaining to them why but I think
[02:23:10] to me that's what vulnerability is is all about those those couple of things there
[02:23:14] yeah this is another negative example that I think is easier to see is if you're talking if you
[02:23:21] work for me and you're talking and I cut you off right that's everyone knows that's disrespectful
[02:23:26] well it's that also means that if I actually listen what you have to say that I'm being
[02:23:31] respectful I'm giving you respect so that's it if you can't remember to listen to people
[02:23:35] remember how rude it is when someone cuts you off and the opposite of that is to actually listen
[02:23:40] to people here's another I think this is a a vulnerability that is so uncomfortable for leaders
[02:23:47] and people and subordinates up and down the chain of command it's a vulnerability that is that is
[02:23:54] people avoid almost at all costs and that is the ability to say I don't know yeah I don't
[02:24:03] I don't know what do you think we should do is I don't know up and down the chain of command
[02:24:07] I think the first place I learned this when when I got to the seal teams you didn't get your
[02:24:14] you weren't a seal when you got to the seal teams you were a new guy an FNG as a matter of fact
[02:24:20] so you get there your FNG you don't have your Trident which is the insignia that means you're a seal
[02:24:25] and so you have to study for six months you're on a probationary board you have to
[02:24:30] your own probation I should say and then you have to eventually go in front of a verbal board
[02:24:34] and you go to the diving you go to the weapon you go to parachute you go to tactics you go to the
[02:24:38] radius you and all these chiefs and master chiefs and senior chiefs and they're asking you questions
[02:24:44] and what they tell you is and this is probably the first place I realized okay that's the
[02:24:48] right thing to do if they ask you question and you don't know what you say is I don't know let me
[02:24:54] do some research and I'll get back to you and that's the right answer and they're going to ask
[02:24:59] you some quite they're going to dig so deep into those manuals they're going to get that answer
[02:25:01] or you can sit there and say you can try and make up an answer you can try and pretend like you
[02:25:05] know it and then you're going to get crushed because you lack the humility and you're not
[02:25:09] being vulnerable enough to say hey I actually don't know so up and down the chain command just
[02:25:14] like you said no one expects the leader to know everything as a leader we think everyone
[02:25:19] expresses know everything and when we try and act like that we look like idiots yeah you don't
[02:25:24] know everything just say hey I don't know what do you think it's perfectly fine three powerful
[02:25:30] words that that leader should live by when when they don't know say it's skipping for it a
[02:25:38] little bit remaining calm during the storm you you you talk about some ways to do this and you
[02:25:45] got a couple points in here take control of the things you can I think this is something that
[02:25:49] even though it's so obvious we still failed to do this people we worry about things we have no control
[02:25:55] over so don't do that but you got another another section here do not catastrophize now did you
[02:26:04] make up that word no that's actually a word I heard when I went through resiliency training okay
[02:26:09] they they talked about the concept of catastrophize so here's the section on catastrophizing
[02:26:16] the United States Army train soldiers on techniques that will help them display resiliency
[02:26:21] one of those techniques which I think is particularly relevant during these uncertain times is
[02:26:26] how to not catastrophize when you catastrophize you focus only on the worst case scenario you believe
[02:26:33] the worst will happen and of course this produces a great deal of anxiety this can also so the
[02:26:37] seeds of self-fulfilling prophecy it a method to place things in perspective and avoid catastrophizing
[02:26:46] is by going through a practical thought process promoting resiliency and reducing anxiety first
[02:26:53] look at what the worst case scenario would possibly look like second identify what the best case
[02:26:57] scenario might be third consider the most likely or probable outcome then focus your attention on the
[02:27:03] plan on the most probable case and develop your primary plan of action around that scenario so this is
[02:27:10] something I think the reason I got a little bit focused on this is because this is what our news
[02:27:16] media gets paid to do catastrophize everything everything is catastrophize everything is a
[02:27:21] worst case scenario the world's gonna end if you follow the headlines the world ends every single day
[02:27:26] it gets killed by COVID by war by this politician by that politician every single day there's a
[02:27:32] catastrophe that happens and and if you do that as a leader you need your you're making a mistake
[02:27:39] but but what's also important is you can't react to these things and someone runs into the
[02:27:44] office with some massive problems like okay let's think through it okay I see you're excited awesome
[02:27:49] let's think through it's astrophysing you know I'm surprised I woke up this morning you know
[02:27:56] watching a news I thought the world ended yesterday but but yeah you're you're exactly
[02:28:01] right and and I do try to use this technique because usually the very worst case doesn't
[02:28:09] doesn't happen and and you get yourself all spun up about it all friggin tense and and stressed out
[02:28:15] about and it's not going to do you any good anyway this is one of one of the most beautiful
[02:28:22] things I learned in the military is the is the counter to the catastrophizing individual above
[02:28:29] you and the chain of command below you and the chain of command appear whatever they're panicking
[02:28:33] they're freaking out and what you learn in the military you learn this powerful word which is
[02:28:38] Roger that or rather Roger that someone comes in they're going crazy oh you can't believe this
[02:28:43] happened I've got Roger meaning okay understand let's let's think about it so anytime be very careful
[02:28:51] as a leader be very careful with the words you choose to explain what's happening and and sometimes
[02:28:57] as a leader we want to get a reaction out of people where we've got this situation happening and we
[02:29:03] know it's critical and we need to make some adjustments and so in order to get people moving instead
[02:29:07] of explaining to them what's happening and why we need to make a move we just go straight to level
[02:29:12] 12 catastrophize in order to get in order to get people to move we catastrophize and the problem
[02:29:20] with that is it ends up being the little boy that cried wolf where you catastrophize everything
[02:29:24] is a catastrophe everything is going to end the world everything is a strategic failure for the team
[02:29:29] everything is a catastrophic event and it's like no in fact there are so few catastrophic events that
[02:29:36] can actually happen that there's almost nothing that you can catastrophize with me you're going
[02:29:42] to get through just about everything that's kind of like the whole thing if everything is a priority
[02:29:46] nothing is a priority exactly you know you you really got to be clear about what the priorities are
[02:29:51] and then get everybody working toward achieving those you know probably maybe two or three
[02:29:57] priorities so things that are really important prioritize an execute I believe I believe that's the
[02:30:03] word um I want to close out with one last section here um and it's it's how you close out the book but it's
[02:30:12] it's a good indicator of everything else that's in the book so it says this I was raised by my
[02:30:18] father that faith in God though we though my father faced setbacks such as losing his wife at an early age
[02:30:24] and raising seven children after her death he never lost faith my father made it a point to
[02:30:30] march us march all seven of his children into church every Sunday morning this made a lifelong
[02:30:38] impression not only on me and my siblings but many others who resided in our community there are
[02:30:44] certain things I learned about good leadership as a young boy from my father and others
[02:30:49] that have been reinforced throughout my life the things I learned were the importance of having
[02:30:54] strong character and staying true to your values even when things got tough being service oriented
[02:31:00] and helping other people whenever you could regardless of their race religion and setting an
[02:31:06] example by doing the right thing even when no one was watching I know I am not a perfect leader
[02:31:12] but I continue to do my best to learn how I can become a better person and a better leader and I
[02:31:17] encourage all who read this book to do the same seek to place the organization you lead in good hands
[02:31:29] well I think that's what we're all trying to do we're all trying to do the same thing
[02:31:34] continue to learn continue trying become better people and better leaders and definitely
[02:31:40] appreciate you for writing this book and and given some of these lessons learned
[02:31:45] no jacco I appreciate the the time to talk about it I appreciate the time to talk about the
[02:31:54] book with you and just really grateful that we could spend a little bit of time you and I just
[02:32:00] just talking about our own leadership philosophies and and what it means to continue to
[02:32:06] learn and continue to grow to be a better leader so thank you for the opportunity yeah there's
[02:32:11] I mean obviously we use some different verbages and some focus here and there might be a little
[02:32:15] bit different but the underlying themes I mean these are these are what leadership these are
[02:32:20] these are the underlying themes that exist in leadership anywhere you look anybody that understands it
[02:32:26] is going to you're going to see these common themes so right now you've got a consulting company
[02:32:33] called leader grovers at leaders grove leader grove leader grove and it's leader grove dot com

[02:34:17] thank you agree with me when i say you don't have to be in a formal position of leadership in order

[02:35:37] you had to say you told us to do operations you told us not to do other operations you told us to
[02:35:42] stay off this street you told us how to better do our tactics so your guys from the 2 to 8

[02:35:54] did for us and and did for America thanks jaco thanks for coming on and with that general john granski
[02:36:03] has left the building so echo yes kind of close that out talking about how people we all want to be better
[02:36:12] need to be better can be better let's see what do we start well we start with our health
[02:36:18] without health we have nothing um straight up from what i understand you add a little disregard of your
[02:36:24] health the other day and went to a McDonald's restaurant it was a eight food there was a momentary lapse of
[02:36:31] judgment uh and discipline for sure but it's the it was what are you to break um opportunistic and this
[02:36:41] is the kind of stuff we got to be careful for or about or whatever you know how you have a routine
[02:36:48] and everyone's all get reminded of the importance of a routine okay i'm not a I don't 100% sign
[02:36:53] on to the whole routine is McDonald's party
[02:36:57] make no well it's an example if you don't have a routine what it does is
[02:37:01] really a lot of your tools and you know what it's like okay you don't you don't have a
[02:37:12] opportunity to do that doesn't matter okay i bought i got the the item that is a soft soft
[02:37:19] bun and inside that bun is a fish flavored concoction you got the fish fillet yeah yeah i don't think
[02:37:28] that's there's real fish in there at all but either way you think there's like a crayfish or something
[02:37:34] there's something in there no you know what it is it's like one of those you just pierce sugar
[02:37:38] yeah it's like a synthetic they they do a sit there i don't know but this is what it feels like
[02:37:42] maybe like a synthetic um material that's made maybe you know like a 3D printer or something
[02:37:47] like this with like some some stuff and then they put like some fish like extract flavor in it
[02:37:54] and then fry it okay was that the path that the path it's making you better okay if you're on
[02:37:59] it okay okay the path is kind of a routine it essentially is and this is important as
[02:38:04] with a routine where if you have a routine there's way way way less opportunity to make to have like
[02:38:09] oh like a decision making conundrum right because the routine the decision you have already made before
[02:38:15] part of the routine while you're not angry hang on through emotional departure
[02:38:20] exactly the question because you haven't had a freaking fish save a few hours
[02:38:24] either way if you're angry even you already know because dinner's soon or you know when
[02:38:29] the dinner is seem saying if you have a routine or lunch or but we'll back with whatever you're
[02:38:33] about to eat whatever you're almost almost all right take you off the path here's
[02:38:38] the here's what Ronald does he he just waits he waits for the people with no routine
[02:38:43] or an or he'll slide into your routine but a lot of times for people like me in this case where
[02:38:50] the little the little crack in the routine he's right there he's like hey you need a decision to
[02:38:55] make I'll make it easy for you what's the one that's gonna give you the pal the quickest
[02:38:59] he seems saying to us what it was instead of going home to dinner my wife was somewhere else
[02:39:04] and she was like hey you know like you know I don't know how much food there's gonna be here or
[02:39:09] whatever so you know grab something this was like cool I made the turn in like literally on my way home
[02:39:14] change trajectory looking to the exit and boom McDonald's is right there made it happen
[02:39:23] in a bad way all right so we don't want to consume things that are our home no what do we want
[02:39:28] to go to the point is health health is a thing with with no health look if I'm gonna make
[02:39:32] Donald every single day my health goes downtown and then eventually I become incapable
[02:39:37] of pretty much anything so if you're unhealthy or your health is in decline or whatever by your
[02:39:43] own meanwhile you have if you have control over it and you choose to not be healthy you can have
[02:39:49] some problems okay so let's choose to be healthy that's what I think like it so on this path
[02:39:54] starts with health fitness capability mental and physical now with that we can have a little
[02:40:01] helper some away that helper is jockel fuel so I'm actually working on a video
[02:40:10] jockel fuel video cool just a small one about why you jockel started jockel fuel interesting
[02:40:18] it actually doesn't go very deep when you think about it's like just stuff that you're using anyway
[02:40:22] that's one of the worst hype you know things I've ever heard like I'm so not hype for this video right
[02:40:27] now yeah but here's the only reason I'm a little bit hyped is I know you wouldn't bring it up
[02:40:31] unless you're hyped so you must have some vision about some explosions that are gonna happen
[02:40:37] uh yeah you know potentially I mean maybe I have explosions either where the point is though the
[02:40:42] point is the reason jockel started jockel fuel is stuff that you use anyway so you figure okay
[02:40:50] let me just refine and maximize the quality on these things that I use anyway produce some
[02:40:56] boom and then we'll have that product there you go one of the many little helpers in life
[02:41:01] helpers on the path because let's face it you're it's late you dinner chains dinner plans change
[02:41:07] your hungry you could you could easily go to McDonald's like echo Charles did which is
[02:41:13] taking him in the wrong direction off the path unhealthy feeling sick later
[02:41:18] not doing a good work out the next day just everything is turning bad or you could power and
[02:41:23] be like oh go I got mock at home you know I got mock at home very high to save your yeah it is
[02:41:30] true and and all you've been explained it's to say how much of a savior it is so look okay so
[02:41:35] energy drinks right you don't know that we're satan to get there in a sleep or dang I have a huge
[02:41:40] workload today and tomorrow maybe I'm need a little booster maybe I'm just used to a little
[02:41:45] boost at some point in the day right but usually we've got a pair of price either we crash or
[02:41:49] either we're drinking something that's unhealthy boom these energy drinks go jocco discipline go
[02:41:55] may or may not be called discipline anymore let's call this one go all right there you go boom jocco
[02:41:59] discipline go is an energy drink with front side and back side benefits and no downside no downside
[02:42:08] kind of went off on that recently we're talking just the just the no downside piece yeah most things
[02:42:14] that are as gratifying and have so much upside usually I was always a little downside right no downside
[02:42:20] not this time boom little helper on that path I mean you're on the path you're still on the path
[02:42:24] little in fact you're even more down the path yeah you're going to good with told me positive
[02:42:30] cross the board so boom or you get home let's face it everyone's in a while you need dinner you
[02:42:34] had a good day you had a good week great week spent time with the family got your work done you know
[02:42:40] you're you're you moved ahead you just want a little celebratory dessert I don't think like this even
[02:42:46] there weird thing is even after you have a 26 ounce rib eye steak yeah that's a and it's maybe
[02:42:55] and it's perfectly cooked even after you get done with that you're you're totally good to go
[02:43:02] but there's another little part of your brain that wants something called dessert oh yeah and you could
[02:43:09] just be like oh well there's the cheese cake or whatever oh yeah kind of negate a lot of the
[02:43:13] stuff that you've been doing all week working hard with we made you dessert yeah the god mook so we
[02:43:19] got some mook boom and here look you want to mook is good let's say your tired is hard week just
[02:43:25] add the mook to the milk or whatever your your preferred mixture this is not a challenging recipe
[02:43:32] exact directive yeah but not limited to that simplicity add some stuff in there at half a banana that's mean it's my
[02:43:39] jam hmm but either way did right there do what you will it's the same deal this will not have
[02:43:45] you slip off the path you're still in the path and all of this isn't really long way of saying go to
[02:43:49] dockoffeele.com get yourself some stuff get yourself some drawing warfare you know acrylic oil super
[02:43:54] krill um vitamin D3 cold cold war yeah these are all helpers with all of the organic
[02:44:03] McDonald's no doubt yes people that are just ab testing things to make it taste good they don't care
[02:44:09] they don't care what you feel like and they don't care about your health yeah don't care there's not
[02:44:13] one single person advocating for your health no they're advocating for you wallet don't do it
[02:44:19] isn't that because you know how you just said that like almost with like a like a like a joking tone
[02:44:26] right yeah but but it's not a joke part is that is 100% true where it's there is not one single
[02:44:31] person no one single person interested in the success of that business which is not necessarily a
[02:44:35] wrong thing to be interested in success is your business well it's wrong if you're going to sacrifice
[02:44:39] people's health not one person carries about your health in fact your health is kind of like a
[02:44:46] pawn you know they're big game at jocco fuel your health is paramount does the only otherwise

[02:45:12] that big of everybody else uses these chemicals no no don't matter yeah isn't that kind of scary

[02:48:27] bastion of freedom that we have that we're kind of setting aside it's our it's our contingency
[02:48:33] AO area of operations look if people get crazy with this whole platform the platforms and
[02:48:38] there's a bunch of them you figure hey well you know you got this platform in that platform one of the
[02:48:42] chances that they all decide to either start inserting ads or start making people pay or whatever
[02:48:49] they're gonna do I don't know but if it happens we have our own little I don't know the world carved out
[02:48:55] we appreciate you coming into our world it's called jocco underground go to jocco underground.com if you

[02:49:33] at jocco underground.com we appreciate the sport and we also have a YouTube channel
[02:49:38] it speaking of platforms true where we put up videos so far you do flip pretty straightforward
[02:49:45] for the platform you know video we've got demonetized a couple times yeah we've had
[02:49:49] warnings only a couple times like what is the the warning of info yeah and keep it
[02:49:56] when you see demonetized because this is different there's different levels of demonetization
[02:49:59] you can get a video demonetized you can get the or the whole channel straight up demonetized
[02:50:06] or this somewhere in between where it's like okay you can proclaim that hey this video contains
[02:50:10] some heavy stuff bro I had one Halloween I did like a quick video of working out or whatever
[02:50:17] something and I put in the background Halloween the song by the miss fits oh yeah and
[02:50:25] we almost instantly it was whatever blocked band and whatever else because it was copyright material
[02:50:32] I was like you know spreading the word on the miss fits like you know what I mean yeah
[02:50:35] it's true but they were on that yeah and you know they did they they kind of consider both sides
[02:50:40] I think anyway because it's like hey what if um they assume that you're making money off of your
[02:50:46] your your probably is a post you're video there's a post oh not on YouTube it was on something else
[02:50:51] it was on the gram oh yeah yeah that's different sweared they came at me well you know what
[02:50:57] what it is it's my hypothesis I think Danzig and the miss fits highly protected there
[02:51:05] I put it IP yeah because you're essentially acting as a distributor
[02:51:10] essentially I mean all I meant to do is actually spread the word hey man this is a great band
[02:51:14] the miss fits bro this is iconic band yes iconic it's true but the rules got to kind of
[02:51:20] apply to everybody you know so without some kind of approval a distributor process I saw the
[02:51:26] miss fits recently with the crowman like before covid in LA in a big giant stadium and you know
[02:51:33] what it was freaking outstanding I mean the crowman was awesome yes absolutely hardly was rocking
[02:51:39] and then the miss fits came out and I was like this is I salute these guys they were honest
[02:51:45] swayers playing the word and yeah I was trying to spread the word a little bit and like they thought
[02:51:49] it was trying to jack their stuff well in their defense they didn't see your posts and and was like
[02:51:54] hey jockel take that down I don't want you you know just dreaming myself it's not how it went down
[02:51:59] but when some people be like hey can you put a clip out of our music so more people buy our music right
[02:52:05] yeah that could happen right what wouldn't they think of it that way instead of the other way technically
[02:52:09] the miss fits didn't do it directly technically instagram did it miss fits probably signed up
[02:52:14] signed that song up to be monitored or whatever automatically so without them checking back with
[02:52:20] you specifically or over to Glenn Danzig and the miss fits I was not doing it nefariously I was
[02:52:29] actually doing a promotional way if you're going to license your songs to me yeah I'll throw them
[02:52:33] out there into the world you can you probably never even heard a miss fits song which is kind of
[02:52:39] sad no I've never I don't think I've heard a miss fits song but I heard you talk about the
[02:52:44] miss you right so kind of the same but that if you heard a miss fits song you'd probably
[02:52:48] like pretty good yeah oh yeah it's it's iconic music to be honest with you it's iconic music
[02:52:56] is iconic an opinion or a factual standard factual so you can have the miss fits what's
[02:53:04] called the white list they can white list your channel actually this is on youtube I know you
[02:53:09] can do this on youtube because this is a nice day it's called jocals jocals down they can whatever
[02:53:14] the he posts all good as far as our account goes if they do that with us I won't abuse it I'm not going
[02:53:20] to make like the you know what I mean this is only on youtube right on youtube but maybe we'll do it on
[02:53:25] instagram yeah just apply the youtube rule fits again I should tell it next time especially
[02:53:31] how long it takes him to shut me down I did some other older hardcore bands and that
[02:53:37] that just wore around for a short period of time no one ever said anything so I think it depends
[02:53:42] on the band yeah they have there you have to register your your songs and stuff like even on
[02:53:47] youtube like if if I use a I don't know your other favorite band like if I use like Taylor Swift or something
[02:53:55] like this right you know that all Taylor Swift songs have been registered with youtube
[02:54:01] through some process that's like hey this little thing this little print imprint or whatever the
[02:54:07] how are they monitor it turns up automatic either and they choose whether it shut down
[02:54:12] um blocked or um just silent something some videos would just be silent because like hey that
[02:54:19] audio is not not cool or they'll just take the monetization did they demonetize my guitar playing
[02:54:27] when I play that song by the way Buffalo no interesting not yours but when he was on
[02:54:32] they got right off oh yeah interesting so you know make sense it's a process I got a new jam
[02:54:38] coming got a new song I'm prepping cool very good to hear right on also subscribe to that
