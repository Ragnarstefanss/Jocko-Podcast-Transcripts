1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is Jocopardcast number 191 with echo Charles and me, Jocca Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Some nights I wake up, drenched in sweat.

3
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I have dreams and some people might call them nightmares, but that would not be accurate.

4
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Because I'm not scared and I'm not anxious. I'm actually amped and I'm ready.

5
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And the dream is usually about some bad situation unfolding really quickly.

6
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Some operation gone, the sideways.

7
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And I'm building somewhere or a bunker or a ravine of some kind.

8
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And the enemy is maneuvering.

9
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And they're bringing it.

10
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And then with a small group, a squad maybe six or eight guys.

11
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And we're low on ammo.

12
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And I'm about out.

13
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And one of the guys is hit and he's hit bad and we can't move.

14
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And we can't leave.

15
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And this is it.

16
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And the enemy is pressing closer.

17
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And I'm prepping grenades.

18
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And as I'm prepping grenades, I got my head down because they're laying down fire and the enemy is advancing.

19
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And we're killing some of them, but others are getting through.

20
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And the enemy fire increases.

21
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And if I'm in a building, I hear the door open up.

22
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And I can hear them entering the building.

23
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And I do a quick assessment. I got three grenades and I got a half a mag left and I got my K bar.

24
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Then I'm ready to get it on.

25
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And I pulled a pin on one of the grenades and I rolled it down the hallway toward the stairs and it explodes.

26
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And then I hear RPGs launch.

27
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And one explodes a little distance away, but then the next one explodes on the wall right near me.

28
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And it knocks me out.

29
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And then I come to and I check for my rifle and grab him for my rifle, but it's not there.

30
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And so I reach for my pistol.

31
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
But my pistol's gone too.

32
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And then I feel for the rest of my gear.

33
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I feel for my knife.

34
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I feel for grenades and there's nothing there.

35
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And then I realize that I'm okay.

36
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
That I'm just sweating a lot.

37
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
But there's no gear. There's no guns.

38
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And I realize that I was asleep and that this was just a dream.

39
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And now I'm laying there in a pool of sweat in my bed.

40
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And I realize that I was asleep and that this was just a dream.

41
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And now I'm laying there in a pool of sweat in my bed.

42
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And I'm awake.

43
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And I'm actually mad because I left my boys hanging there in my dream.

44
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And I'm also mad because I don't get that final confrontation with the enemy.

45
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And I'll sit there and close my eyes and I'll try and fall back asleep.

46
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
I'll try and force myself back in there so I can finish the fight.

47
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I can't force myself to fall back asleep.

48
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So I lie there in bed.

49
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And I start thinking about what I would have done.

50
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I start thinking if there's any mistakes that I made.

51
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I start thinking about how I could have defended that position,

52
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
where I would have maneuvered to,

53
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
how I could have maximized damage to the enemy.

54
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And then I think about the rest of the guys on the team.

55
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And I think if I was in that situation,

56
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
who would I want with me?

57
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And this was, this was a common topic in the teams.

58
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
If you were in a desperate scenario,

59
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
but the odds stacked against you,

60
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
if it was time for the last stand,

61
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
for victory or death,

62
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
who would you want with you?

63
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I have a list of those names.

64
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Those men,

65
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
a list of the guys I want with me,

66
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
in that most critical of moments.

67
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And when I think about that list,

68
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
there's always one guy that comes to mind first.

69
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
A guy that I've seen perform on the battlefield,

70
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
not for an hour,

71
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
not for a day or not for a week,

72
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.000
but for months on end,

73
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
this guy would go out on a three day operation

74
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
in 120 degree heat,

75
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
with two liters of water, three cans of Copenhagen.

76
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And twice as many bullets as anyone else.

77
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And as soon as the mission was over,

78
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
he'd want to go back out again.

79
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
This is a guy that can lead,

80
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and that can follow a guy that can plan and execute.

81
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
The guy that never put himself above the good of the mission,

82
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
or above the good of his teammates.

83
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And I know without a shred of doubt,

84
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
that he would have rather himself be killed,

85
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
or wounded than watch me be killed,

86
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.000
or wounded.

87
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
He would step into the line of fire,

88
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
take a bullet,

89
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
or jump on a grenade to protect me,

90
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
or any of our brothers in arms.

91
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
That's the guy I'm talking about.

92
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And the other thing is,

93
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I know what he's thinking,

94
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and he knows what I'm thinking.

95
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And there's no need to even talk,

96
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
where we were raised at the same team by the same people.

97
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
We don't have to debate or discuss whether we should do this or do that.

98
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
We look at each other,

99
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
give a little nod,

100
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and we know what we need to do.

101
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
So if I have to assault a beach,

102
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
or attack a bunker,

103
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
or storm the gates of hell,

104
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I want my brother Tony a fratty by my side,

105
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
BTF Tony,

106
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
big tough frogman.

107
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And that's what he is through and through,

108
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and that's what he did for his entire career through eight overseas deployments.

109
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
He was one of the first guests I had on the podcast,

110
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
podcast number 41.

111
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
If you haven't listened to that podcast,

112
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
stop and go back and listen to it.

113
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
But if you had to have listened to it,

114
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
well,

115
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
then here we go again with BTF Tony,

116
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
welcome back.

117
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Yeah, let's just,

118
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
it deployments are 10, 10 deployments.

119
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
No, let's just get back because I didn't want you to get wounded,

120
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
because you're such a monster,

121
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
that's a carry-in.

122
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
It'd be a little better if I go wounded these years.

123
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
I could put you in my cargo pocket.

124
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Yeah, BTF's great big tough,

125
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I'm not really tired.

126
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Wack of do,

127
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
so last time you were on,

128
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
we kind of just jumped right into like going into the teams and everything.

129
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And,

130
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
which meant we skipped over a bunch of stuff,

131
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
I mean not a bunch, but I mean, because I know you're going to put it.

132
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Why would you grow up? Why grew up?

133
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Yeah, maybe, maybe, and that's it.

134
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So, so you grew up in New England.

135
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Yeah, New Hampshire.

136
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And, and did you play sports?

137
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Yeah, I played hockey in baseball.

138
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Did they issue you a hockey stick when you were born in New Hampshire?

139
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Yeah, it's pretty much,

140
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
you get one in kindergarten,

141
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and then you play street hockey,

142
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and then you learn how to, you know,

143
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
like, wrap up your buddies and then get your ass kicked,

144
00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and then you just keep playing.

145
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Did you play organized hockey?

146
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Yeah, yeah, I played Rekhockey, I played youth hockey,

147
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
all the way up to I was like 17.

148
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Yep, played all my life, three years old till,

149
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
like, 17.

150
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
You kept all your teeth?

151
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Yeah, pretty much.

152
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I played,

153
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
might squirt,

154
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
bannoms, and midgets, and sport categories,

155
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:25.000
which means wise.

156
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Yeah, I played a lot of hockey, and,

157
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
until I got a little bit older, and then, you know, I had to work.

158
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Yeah, so schoolwork, one lot of time for it,

159
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and I realized it wasn't going to be like wicked goods,

160
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
so I just, it was fun.

161
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Yeah, it was like, yeah, okay, chapter my life, and that's it.

162
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
But I still love hockey, you know, a lot of it, you know, big fan.

163
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And, like, when I was a kid,

164
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
we would play like out on lakes,

165
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
because I didn't play at work, and I was talking to you.

166
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Yeah, yeah, we would tape a magazines to our shins,

167
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
because we didn't have, like, the actual year.

168
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So we would just do that, that way when you get

169
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
shwacked with a puck or a stick, you're not just done.

170
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Not, but even the summer is like,

171
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
people my age, your age,

172
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
everybody knows what I'm talking about, like Saturday morning,

173
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
when you're a little mother would give you breakfast,

174
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
they get the hell out, come back and lunch.

175
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
So I went in my room and went in my little computer and

176
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
have any of that.

177
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
So we went, like, we rocks at each other or play baseball and a field.

178
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Yeah, you see, your mom would say, come home for lunch.

179
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
My mom would just say, get out.

180
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
But then the funny thing is, when, when it was like,

181
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
oh, it's time to eat, it'd be like, oh, cool.

182
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I'm going to get a Snickers bar and a can of Coke.

183
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
That's what we ate. That's what we ate. That's what we ate.

184
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
It wasn't like, we need to watch your content.

185
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
What the fuck is it?

186
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
It was cool.

187
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Some stuff that floats around in the sky.

188
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
I don't know what that is.

189
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Apparently people would allergic to it.

190
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I don't fucking know.

191
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
You know, I always knew about the peanuts and the shellfish and all that shit.

192
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Not really eating.

193
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
You know, man, you know, it's on the table either.

194
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
That's it. Don't eat.

195
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Yeah.

196
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I just, the things, they didn't even all catch myself.

197
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
You know, with my kids going, you know, you don't want to drink that soda.

198
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And I'm thinking about when I was a kid, just that's, that's all we drink.

199
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
We didn't drink the first of all.

200
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
There's no such thing as bottled water.

201
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
No, no, that's still that calm.

202
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
You drink it out of the tap.

203
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
It's better than avian or whatever the fuck it is, you know.

204
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
It's like the best. It's like so good.

205
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
I feel like fill up the right and sink and it's still the best.

206
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
So you played hockey and then what, what?

207
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
When you went to high school, did you guys have a hockey team at your high school?

208
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Now the next the next town dead, but we didn't have a high school team.

209
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Dad, you thought you'd.

210
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So then you read, did you play anything and did you play any sports in high school?

211
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Just baseball.

212
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Just baseball.

213
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Yeah, and then I, I sucked it at, but I played a little league and played into my junior high.

214
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I bet I sucked at baseball more than you, which was a bummer.

215
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
My dad was like a fanatic about baseball and I was out there going, this is the most boring thing

216
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I've ever done in my whole life ever.

217
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Like, yeah, this is, I could, you know, because I was, whatever, seven years old.

218
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
But I like, I stand there.

219
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I like it because now I watch baseball and I know I get the appeal, Mal,

220
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
but what I'm saying is when I was seven year old,

221
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
that freaking hyperactive youth and my dad's like, you know, this is a great game.

222
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
You got to understand the tactics and the strategy behind what's going on.

223
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
You're care about it and I'm like,

224
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
because the funnest thing, like the funnest sport that I remember playing that I said,

225
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Oh, this is cool.

226
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Was dodgeball.

227
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.000
That was violent.

228
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Yeah, you're like, oh, hug the balls at the other people.

229
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
That was fun.

230
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
It was like highly active.

231
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Yeah. So we played racquet, a racquet hockey though, and I was a kid too.

232
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And that was all on outdoor rinks.

233
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.000
That's awesome.

234
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
wooden boards and be like 10 boys there and they flooded.

235
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And then like my uncle was the coach of one of the weeks.

236
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And he was terrible like he didn't even know to skate, but he had no idea about how to play hockey.

237
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.000
You just kill him.

238
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
We'd have checking practice for an hour.

239
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Just go out there and check each other like really.

240
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
You know, I didn't.

241
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I was like, I mean, I know how to play.

242
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.000
I know the rules.

243
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And this is what we're doing.

244
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:39.000
All right.

245
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Just go out there and kill each other.

246
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Yeah, you and I were talking about the fact that hockey players are getting smaller again now.

247
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Yeah, there was a there was like, yes, because this is this one.

248
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I went talk to the goals, the San Diego goals,

249
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and their coach was explaining to me because I said, man, the guys are smaller than I expected.

250
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Some of them.

251
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Yeah.

252
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And he said, I said, I thought everyone was huge.

253
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Now.

254
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And he said, no, because now what they figured out is these smaller faster quicker guys have a have an advantage that they can exploit maneuverability.

255
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Just like on the battlefield, you can exploit being able to maneuver.

256
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And these smaller quicker guys can actually maneuver faster than the bigger lumbering guys.

257
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Now there's position for the bigger guys, too.

258
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Yeah, you got to have a mix.

259
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Yeah, so that's what they're figured out.

260
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Yeah, that's a different.

261
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
So if you were to go back in time, you might be able to hack it now.

262
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Yeah.

263
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I played sports, but my real thing was like hot and efficient and trapping.

264
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And I did all that shit.

265
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
So that kind of took a higher step.

266
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
That was a press.

267
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:47.000
That's what I like.

268
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
I'm already free. Yeah. I like being out in the woods hunting.

269
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Was your dad in the military? Yes, my dad was in the army in 60s.

270
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Drop did.

271
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
He wasn't in Vietnam. He went to Germany.

272
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
He was a helicopter mechanic.

273
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
He's over in Germany.

274
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Yeah.

275
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Coolest and richest guy ever.

276
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Right.

277
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Yeah. Like drink beer and you know, go to work every day and end.

278
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And did he talk to you about the military doll?

279
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
What made you want to join the night?

280
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Because did you join right out of high school?

281
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Yeah, I enlisted when I was, uh, see.

282
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Six days after I turned 17 day.

283
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
So I was in delayed entry for you.

284
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And then I went six days after I turned 18.

285
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
What made you want to join the Navy?

286
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Because this is the thing.

287
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
This is the thing that I tried to warn people about the Navy.

288
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
If you want to go in the Navy and be in the SEAL teams, that's cool and everything.

289
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
If you don't make it in the SEAL teams, your job is not going to be that cool.

290
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
I mean, unless you're into that kind of thing, because there's some people that want to work with technology.

291
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
That's cool. You'll be an ITman in the Navy.

292
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Or you want to work with engines and you're being engine men.

293
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Or you want to be a gunner. Like that's cool.

294
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
If that's what you want to do. But those are industrial type jobs.

295
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Yeah, they're not really job. They're not really job.

296
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
They're industrial jobs. They're trades.

297
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
In the army, like if you don't make it to special forces or you don't make it to Rangers or in the Marine Corps, if you don't make the Marsock,

298
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
you can still be an infantryman, which means you're still getting to get an actor.

299
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Do the machine gun thing, which is pretty much what I think most people when they join the military.

300
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Well, I shouldn't say most people.

301
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
If you're even thinking about special operations, then you want to, you want to be using the machine gun.

302
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Well, yeah, I mean, you want to have a machine gun and everyday wife.

303
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
I mean, we're coming so handy to eliminate a lot of, you're bringing a hot shit.

304
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
You know what, you're waiting in traffic, just get out, excuse me folks.

305
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
You should go light down. Okay.

306
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
It would be so much easier.

307
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
I mean, it's legal, but you know.

308
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
So you, but you, what did you join the Navy to be?

309
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Or do you just be like, I want to be a, I want to be a frog man, but it took me a while.

310
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
It took me a couple years to go to Buds.

311
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
How did you know about this, what year was this? Like 86?

312
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Yeah, I knew about the seal teams.

313
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:20.000
I wanted to do it, but the thing that helped me the most was actually doing like two years in the fleet.

314
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
And yeah, it's two years I could have been a team guy, but for me, I wasn't ready.

315
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000
It wasn't mature enough. So I had, I needed that structure and I wanted how the Navy works.

316
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
And it brought you people out there and all that.

317
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
I was stationed in the Philippines for two years.

318
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
It's not like I wasn't on a boat.

319
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
I was just drinking and you know, just being a madman.

320
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
And of course, the seal teams were over there, you know, the West Coast guys.

321
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Yeah, I mean, I'm not as well just do that. That's like the best.

322
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000
So I was a bit ridiculous. You're 17 years old and you get, you get 18 stations in Subic and Subic.

323
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
As a what, my anman, almost a lineman.

324
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
It's like sure, dude. You know, but it's like overseas duty.

325
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
There's the best in the battle.

326
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Did they give you, did they give you kind of like briefing as this 18 year old kid?

327
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Like, okay, you're in the Philippines now.

328
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
This is what's about.

329
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
I just tell you because it's all about those all kinds of hookers and that's like the main thing.

330
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Back then was hookers and drinking. There was like 250 bars in like a city block.

331
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
And you know, I made like $200 every two weeks.

332
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
And I always had money.

333
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Yeah, because it was like, we go to like happy hour or whatever.

334
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:48.000
And then morning like Saturday morning at like teased havern or wherever it was on Gordon Avenue.

335
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
And it was like nickel for the.

336
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
So I really like weren't my polish and my drinking skills like big time over there.

337
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And of course, it's a thousand degrees out and it's just like,

338
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
So much fun.

339
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Yeah, when I my first two years, you're just like, okay, I mean, come on.

340
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
He's actually had enough of it. Well, I wanted to get on with, you know, I got,

341
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
I took my screen task at orders to buds and was like, all right.

342
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
And back then, now they got this big fucking pipeline and all this.

343
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
I flew in the corner.

344
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
I don't want to Friday.

345
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Sunday we had a class up party, which is you shave your head.

346
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
There's a cake of being a get liquor to up and then be idiots.

347
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
And then Monday morning you start this day one.

348
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
So you checked it on Friday, shaved your head on Sunday.

349
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Hey, one class up on Monday. That's it. Yep. Here we go. Did you get rolled?

350
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
I got rolled in the second phase, which nobody does.

351
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
I think it hurt.

352
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
I just wouldn't leave my slim body.

353
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
What happened?

354
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:57.000
My swim buddy.

355
00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
On a swim on like a time.

356
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
I'm like, I, well, you can't leave your swim buddy.

357
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Right. So what do you do? Yeah.

358
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
You fail. Yeah.

359
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
And you just take it in the shitter and then, and then like the next,

360
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
well, you know, next class, like I was like me and bring the cheese man.

361
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.000
He's dead now.

362
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Yeah.

363
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.000
We're like, the top three swim pairs.

364
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my.

365
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
I failed to swim.

366
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:23.000
We can't, you can't, you can't.

367
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.000
So I go.

368
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
They, they bring us to the first phase office.

369
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
And I'm standing with my swim buddy.

370
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.000
And they're like, all right.

371
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
And they, there was a, you know, 10 or 12 or 15 pairs failed to swim.

372
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
So they're asking everyone like they're calling us in the office.

373
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
The first phase office by the bell.

374
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
So me and my swim buddy get called in.

375
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
We're like number seven to get called in.

376
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
I couldn't hear what everyone else was saying, but I didn't know what that was going on.

377
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
I was just like scared. I wanted to do one to make it through this training.

378
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
So we go in there.

379
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
And so there's something called guiding, which is like the person that when you're swimming in the open ocean,

380
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
you have to, it's basically steering, but you call it guiding for some reason, you know, you guide, so make sure swimming in the direction.

381
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
So they go, you know, you two next pair of getting here.

382
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
So we walk in, I'm standing in attention.

383
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
What the hell happened to you two?

384
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
And my swim buddy points at me and goes, willing, doesn't know how to guide.

385
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Oh my god.

386
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
And I was like, and the guy was a slow swimmer like that was the problem.

387
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
And he was, that was the problem.

388
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Yeah, but and so I'm standing there.

389
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Just going damn, I just got just got dying out for something. I've even knew.

390
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
So I just kept my mouth shut and it was like, I'll do better, right?

391
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
And then what they did was they split us up and they put us with good swimmers.

392
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
And then the same thing like meet me and my new swim buddy on the next swim came in like fifth or seventh or something.

393
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
I wouldn't get to come in first or second because I was not enough that.

394
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
No, because you got some of those fuckers in there that are swimming like 17 knots.

395
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Yeah, but this guy failed to get.

396
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Yeah, and it was like, oh, maybe it wasn't a wheeling.

397
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Yeah, really screwed you over.

398
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
But it was all right, you know, I just had to wait for weeks, five weeks.

399
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Get back in and it was fine.

400
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
And then, and then you, you graduated buds.

401
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Were you good in the water when you showed up at buds?

402
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

403
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Did you grow up swimming in lakes? No, it's just something you got to do.

404
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Like, like, how many times was I in the woods with people in the teams?

405
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
From, you know, New York or Jacksonville, Florida or New York City or Chicago.

406
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
They're like, what the fuck? What, what, man, it's dark.

407
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Like, who would say that? It's dark. It's dark.

408
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
It's dark. It's night. The fuck.

409
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
What do you think we're going to do? Like, go, you know, just lunch.

410
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
We're going to go on lunch and be eating in an owl.

411
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
So it's just one of those things you got to do.

412
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
There's some people that don't do that very well.

413
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
I know, I had a guy in my class, like a super stud wrestler from Iowa,

414
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
but he never went in the water and dude.

415
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
He was my swim buddy in, uh, in like the pool phase,

416
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
where they're doing like the stuff and the pool with you.

417
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Yeah, well, you, I actually got a buddy of the stuff on your,

418
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
so we're doing buddy breathing and this dude is taking the regulator and breathing

419
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
47 breast and roll, giving it back to me. I'd take like a breath and a half.

420
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, like dude, relax.

421
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
He's still, he still popped to the surface.

422
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
And yeah, he didn't make it. He didn't make it because he would just freak out in the water.

423
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
So, yeah, man, I was lucky, you know, up in Maine as a little kid went in the water all the time.

424
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Because the water never freaked me out. I just hit my fly and people out, man.

425
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
But that's the whole thing. You have to be competent in the water.

426
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Like when you're underneath the ship and you're de-rigin' and all that,

427
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
then everybody's like, right next to each other and you just see anything.

428
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000
There's just like courts floating around my god.

429
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
People think like it's all, you watch the movies, they go, they show them diving,

430
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
then all of a sudden they show them climbing the ship, like,

431
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
what about all the shit in between?

432
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
You're missing like the biggest fucking portion that's terrible.

433
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
You're under the air and it's like,

434
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
what the fuck is that in the water?

435
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
It's everywhere. And the guy's kicking you in the mask and then you've got to deal with that.

436
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
And it's just fucking some other dude that's like sinking to the bottom.

437
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Yeah, I can you down and it's like, why is the line?

438
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
What is all this pressure going in this way for?

439
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
That wasn't the plan, but you re-hurt this like forty time.

440
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
You can't communicate anything.

441
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
It's all just nothing. It's all just nothing. Yeah, it's just not really.

442
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
And you just after a while, it's like survival.

443
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Like you just got to not die.

444
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
And then somehow it usually works out.

445
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Next thing, you know, you draw on the surface and everything is easy.

446
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
And then you got to go back.

447
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
I think that's what makes the team's good.

448
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
I think what makes the team's good is when you have to deal with all that crap of whether it's going over the beach,

449
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
just to do a land warfare up, but you come over the beach,

450
00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000
or, you know, derigging underwater or a combat swimmer up or rigging the boats or whatever,

451
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
when you add the water and it just makes it, it's all real real good.

452
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
You're so much freaking out. Even in training, it's real world.

453
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Yeah, you can drown down.

454
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
You can, I mean, but the bud's thing, like,

455
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
I didn't grow up syrup on running that stuff, but the other things, I didn't have a plan B.

456
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Yeah, that was easy for me. I never even thought about quitting anything.

457
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
I mean, it was like, why? There's nothing else to do.

458
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Yeah.

459
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
I mean, everything else is just garbage, junk and like,

460
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
I'm not, no, I have to do this. This is what I have to do because it's like the best.

461
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Yeah, I, I never thought about quitting at all.

462
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
And it was weird. I had my class that was from the fleet.

463
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
And he was like, man, you don't want to go to the fleet, dude.

464
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
It's you don't do not want to go to the fleet.

465
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
And blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

466
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
And he quit again.

467
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Yeah, well, and I just was like, man, really?

468
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
We had these serial quitters that had come back and come back and like,

469
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
after a while, you know, give up.

470
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Like, what's that, the person you don't succeed try try again?

471
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
How many try?

472
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
And then quit. And it's just being a damn fool about it, you know?

473
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
But I just didn't have a plan B.

474
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
You know, did, did you do any of the water stuff when you were in

475
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Superbick Bay? Did you did any of the team guys show you like,

476
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
not tying or any of it?

477
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
No, not at all.

478
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
I did, I did dive though.

479
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000
I got my like, okay, there you go.

480
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:35.000
That's good.

481
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Because diving, like when you, I've never done that,

482
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
but when you go through like the basic, do they do some kind of,

483
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Yeah, you do like, quite a lot of everything, but it's like,

484
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
the big, the big, beautiful red dude.

485
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Yeah, and you're like, okay, and then take your mask off and then

486
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
blow through, yeah, okay, clear your mask and,

487
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.000
yeah, whatever.

488
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
But that's definitely helpful.

489
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.000
But it was fun.

490
00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:58.000
I mean, it was something to do.

491
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
It was like drinking all the time.

492
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
So I did that like one weekend and then it was like, yeah,

493
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
is that how long it takes to get one of those qualifications?

494
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Yeah, you go to some classes and pool and then they take you and

495
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
then swoop it like, like, flip, flop, I want.

496
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
It's actually really nice, man.

497
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Yeah, man, when I got the little card,

498
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
remember you went through Buds and you get,

499
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
why don't you have this for you?

500
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Yeah, they did.

501
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Yeah, so I got look a little card that said I was qualified.

502
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Like I could go rent, dive her.

503
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Yeah, and I don't know where that is.

504
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Lost it.

505
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Yeah, fucking.

506
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
But when I had that thing, that thing, I got that,

507
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
and I thought I was kind of the band.

508
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
You know, I was like, you know, I would look at it from, you know,

509
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
be my wallet, look at it like, oh, yeah.

510
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
You feel like you're the Jesus.

511
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Yeah, it's like, I felt like I was James Bond's like who cares.

512
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Whatever.

513
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.000
No, not even a thing anymore.

514
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:52.000
No, not nothing.

515
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Kind of like when I got issue my first floppy hat.

516
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Oh, yeah, I thought, yeah, well, he arrived.

517
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Yeah, I'm ready to go to know.

518
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:02.000
I know.

519
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:04.000
I know.

520
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Oh, it's like, that's like, like you said last time, I think I thought I was going to be a nom, like that day.

521
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Yeah, I know, but I still have my first floppy hat.

522
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
I have a cost you do.

523
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Yeah, just keep everything.

524
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
I don't, I didn't keep anything.

525
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
You might need it one day.

526
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Now I kept my floppy hat.

527
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
I don't have a shadow box.

528
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
I have a shadow box that someone made me, like,

529
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
these good friends of mine who used to do that,

530
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
living like make coins,

531
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
made it for me as a pair of it.

532
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
And my room somewhere is like not, I don't know where any of my medals.

533
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Yeah, I'm like just such a loser when it comes to that shit.

534
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
One time I was in my son's room when he was like,

535
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
maybe seven or no, he's probably nine or ten years old.

536
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000
And I'm like looking for something.

537
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
I figured he took it and I'm walking around.

538
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Who stole my, yeah, exactly.

539
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
There's an all the time.

540
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
I stepped on something and it's like sharp.

541
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
And I'm like, oh, it's underneath a pile of my kids clothes.

542
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
I'm holding out and it's like, a bunch of a bunch of my medals.

543
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
You know, a little rack of my alcohol.

544
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Whatever.

545
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Yeah, life.

546
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Life's like,

547
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
life said to me,

548
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
man, we never got you anything for to you.

549
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:15.000
I'm going to get you something.

550
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
He's been saying that for like 10 years.

551
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
I mean, he's busy.

552
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

553
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
So that's why I don't have any kind of nothing.

554
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
The guys when I retired gave me a big giant,

555
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000
I was like, I'm not saying it.

556
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
I'm not saying it.

557
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
I'm not saying it.

558
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
I'm not saying it.

559
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
I'm saying it.

560
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
That's like, I'm pretty cool.

561
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:38.000
I'm pretty cool.

562
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
I'm really, yeah.

563
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
I'm just having a corner with all my weight lifting bars.

564
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
I have it in there.

565
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Oh, yeah.

566
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Yeah.

567
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Everyone's well, if I, I feel like if I, if someone breaks into my house.

568
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
I'm also spear him though, like through the midsection.

569
00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Yeah.

570
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
And then like get the war, you know.

571
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
And then you both can lift up like,

572
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
I think going.

573
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Be a good picture.

574
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:06.000
All right.

575
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:07.000
So you get done with buds.

576
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:08.000
No factor.

577
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Whatever.

578
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
You show up at T-1.

579
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
And did you get put into a patuna immediately?

580
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Yeah.

581
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
And it's now what?

582
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
1989?

583
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Yeah.

584
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
So is the Gulf War on the horizon yet?

585
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Or not, no way.

586
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
So Kuwait has not been invaded yet or it has been invaded.

587
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.000
But we're not sure we're going to do that.

588
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:29.000
That has been August 6th.

589
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
And when did you get to the team?

590
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Like December.

591
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Okay.

592
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
So it took about nine months.

593
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
So you showed up at the team.

594
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:38.000
There's no war going on.

595
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.000
But we had to go through SBI.

596
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Okay.

597
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
And then I have SQT back there.

598
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.000
SBI.

599
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:44.000
I still basic in doc.

600
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
And they just grabbed a bunch of guys.

601
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
And it was actually really square away at T-1.

602
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Yeah.

603
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
You did land warfare.

604
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:51.000
You did demo.

605
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
All your weapons and shit.

606
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:54.000
But trolling tactics.

607
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
You did maritime air.

608
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
You know, rubber ducks.

609
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Lump ducks all that shit.

610
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
You did a photo intel.

611
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Like all kinds of stuff.

612
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Infilled developing.

613
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Yeah.

614
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Yeah.

615
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:09.000
I was just talking to this camera guy.

616
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:10.000
I up in my homings.

617
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
I told him I used to do that.

618
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:13.000
Wow.

619
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Now it's all like digital camp.

620
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Yeah.

621
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
You ain't got to do any of that.

622
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Yeah.

623
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Of course, spend hours and hours doing that.

624
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
And then a lot of shooting basic shooting.

625
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
You know, shot and 14 till your trigger and fingers go.

626
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Because you were not a man if you didn't carry them 14.

627
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Well, yeah, because it was like the past.

628
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
My bicep would get bruised from shooting the M14.

629
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Because, and I know people say,

630
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
because it would be like move like you can't just keep it.

631
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:46.000
There have all time.

632
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
No, it's like gigantic.

633
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
That's why the M14 God bless its soul.

634
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Such a great weapon.

635
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Remember how many malfunctions you had with it?

636
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Yes.

637
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Oh, yeah.

638
00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Yeah.

639
00:32:00.000 --> 00:31:59.000
I had one.

640
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Somebody else's shell from an M from an M16 went and like went.

641
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Lodged somehow into my ejector port.

642
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Well, yeah.

643
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:09.000
In the middle of whatever.

644
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Yeah.

645
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Yeah.

646
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Yeah.

647
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
But yeah, those things are freaking accurate.

648
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
They didn't survive the,

649
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
how do I put it?

650
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
The rail system.

651
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Once everything started becoming attachments and shit.

652
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
They tried to do it.

653
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
And then the gun was like 360 pounds.

654
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
So it never really,

655
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
but back then, the M16 was basically a piece of shit.

656
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
And even the NR727, the carpetteens,

657
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
that whole evolution leading up to the M4,

658
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
they got better and better and better and more reliable.

659
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
You know, it just makes sense on the battlefield.

660
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
If you're, you've got an M4, you've got a, you know,

661
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
by by six.

662
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
You work with the Marines, the Army.

663
00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
You can always go anywhere and get some more ammo.

664
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
It's like who has strip clip friggin,

665
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
308 ammo.

666
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
You know, 762, nobody.

667
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
You know, do you ain't get up to 60?

668
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
That got to be a wicked pain in the ass.

669
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Anyway, but it was a great gun.

670
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
I mean, I still love the thing.

671
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000
You put that front side on there, Mr.

672
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Yeah.

673
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
As far as I get the X and night vision,

674
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
it didn't make the cutting.

675
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Yeah.

676
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
My take about, you know.

677
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Yeah.

678
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000
I still have one.

679
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
That's the like my primary battle rifle.

680
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Oh, it's great.

681
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Yeah.

682
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Yeah.

683
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
100% is going to work.

684
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000
I mean, if shit goes down,

685
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
chaos in the streets,

686
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
and you're like on a cold as act,

687
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:43.000
you could come out with that.

688
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
I mean, I have a fucking Tommy gun, is what I'd have.

689
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
My fedora on.

690
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
You're black and everybody, but you know,

691
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
you fantasize about stuff.

692
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Yeah.

693
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
I mean, it's just, it's Tuesday afternoon.

694
00:33:59.000 --> 00:33:59.000
What are you going to do?

695
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.000
I mean, yeah.

696
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
I mean, I mean, come on.

697
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Hey, you want to go to the bar and get liquored up.

698
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Yeah, I'll be scrub my Tommy gun real quick.

699
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:07.000
What?

700
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Yeah.

701
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
So SBI.

702
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
You go through your load of bunch of stuff.

703
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
I had STT.

704
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:19.000
It's what they called it when I went through.

705
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Yeah.

706
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
And then good dudes teach us that stuff.

707
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Oh, it was great because you still got kind of treat you like shit.

708
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
But you were at, you know,

709
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
you weren't a new guy. You weren't a bud just do.

710
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Yeah, you were getting treated like a little bit better than a bud's guy.

711
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Then did you get, then you got a sign to a platoon?

712
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Yes, sir.

713
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
I got a sign to, uh, alphanctum, siltin one.

714
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
And so in the old days, alphanctum met you a ride in a boat.

715
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Yes, uh, hargalfa.

716
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000
I didn't care.

717
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Did you know anything?

718
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:50.000
You're just like, oh, yeah, whatever.

719
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:51.000
I'm in a platoon.

720
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
How many new guys were in your first platoon?

721
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
We had a few.

722
00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
We had like, uh, because sometimes they used to stack the argplotains with more new guys.

723
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
We had, uh, because we wanted to fill that thing up because no one wanted to do an unarg flow.

724
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Wow, you know, new guy.

725
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
I am new to you.

726
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
No, that's what I'm saying.

727
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000
So it'd be like, oh, okay, if there's bud's put all the new guys in there.

728
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Yeah.

729
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
And let them flow.

730
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
But you got, you had a badass LPO.

731
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
I did.

732
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:16.000
I did.

733
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000
I had an LPO leading patty officer who was one of my bud's instructors.

734
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
What was he like as a bud's instructor?

735
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Quiet and like, mean looking like, kind of like, if you don't do this, you're just a big pussy.

736
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
You know, or the, you guys aren't putting out and just, just like,

737
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
because he was good at, how did he, oh, he was wicked.

738
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
He was good at everything.

739
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Once he became my LPO, like he was good at shooting.

740
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
He was good at shooting. He was good at all water stuff.

741
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
He grew up like somewhere in California.

742
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
And kayak. He could kayak.

743
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
He was really good skydiver.

744
00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Yeah.

745
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
He was just good at everything.

746
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Everything.

747
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Mount nearing.

748
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
So respected.

749
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Yeah.

750
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
And freaking nice man.

751
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Yeah, he's a great guy.

752
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
I'm going to actually see him here.

753
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
All right.

754
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
By the time this podcast is probably,

755
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
I'm going to visit him somewhere in the country here.

756
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:22.000
But he did, I think, 20 years after that is a state trooper there.

757
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Yeah.

758
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
I think it was Alaska, I'm pretty sure.

759
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
But he's just, he thrived in that environment.

760
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
And he was a good teacher.

761
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Like he'd take us and go, okay, guys,

762
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
here's, here's how you do this.

763
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
You're like 80% correct.

764
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Yeah.

765
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
He was a 20% that you suck at.

766
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
And here's how to get better at it.

767
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
And he's like, you know, like, Roger that.

768
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
I mean, he was just, and a good dude.

769
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
The reason I know him is because when he got back from that deployment,

770
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
he took over CQC or CQB at T1.

771
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
He was the CQB instructor.

772
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
So he put me and my first work up through CQB.

773
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
And he was the first guy that I was looking at.

774
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
My maybe not the first guy, but he might have been.

775
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
He was the first guy I was looking at going.

776
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
He's, there's a lot of going on here.

777
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
There's a lot like, yeah.

778
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
And just a mechanical thing of your going through and your clearing rooms.

779
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Like there's, there's, there's thought happening here.

780
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
There's, there's intentional decisions being made.

781
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Like I could see, I could see that with a way he would,

782
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
the explain things.

783
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
I'd be thinking, okay, he knows like some more,

784
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
a lot more than, oh yeah.

785
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Then a lot of us other guys do.

786
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Yeah.

787
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
And he explained some little detail.

788
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
And you'd say, oh, and it would make sense to me.

789
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
You know, I'd be thinking, wow, that makes a lot of sense.

790
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Yeah, he'd say stuff like, you know, room combat shit.

791
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
He'd say, like, well, what are you doing that?

792
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Like, well, we're done here.

793
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
We're going to go there.

794
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Well, what about deconstruction?

795
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Like, what do you mean?

796
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Well, you're not the only group within your group.

797
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Assaulting this building or the ship.

798
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
You're going to make sure that the other guys,

799
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
you know, like, all right.

800
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Yeah.

801
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
You know, the first one, actually exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about.

802
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
When the blinders come off, and the teams,

803
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
everything's like, went from went with, you know,

804
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000
CQC, whatever you want to call it, now, skydiving, diving.

805
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Once the blinders come off, and the good, the good people

806
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
when you're alive from the teams,

807
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
will make the blinders come off.

808
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
And then that's when you start growing as a frogman.

809
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Because it's easy, just go, yeah, okay, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

810
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
But you have to do the basic shit so well,

811
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
and never forget it.

812
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
But then open your mind up to what?

813
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000
It's like shooting, like, front sight, front sight, front sight.

814
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Then you get exposed to both eyes open.

815
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
And your front sight is blurry, because your target's clear.

816
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Because guess what?

817
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
When you're shooting paper, front sight, front sight, front sight,

818
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
that's great.

819
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
But when you're shooting people,

820
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
you have to make sure you can shoot them.

821
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
You have to look at their hands.

822
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
You can't do that if the target's blurry.

823
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Right.

824
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
So when you transition, I mean, that really opens you eyes.

825
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
You do years and years of front sight,

826
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
and then you start opening your eyes.

827
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
And look, because you have to.

828
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
And then it all goes away, because you're on nods,

829
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000
and you've got to laser.

830
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
And then you have to transition,

831
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000
because you might be noon, you might have to go

832
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000
to salt this building.

833
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
I remember we were doing a shipboard movement on the,

834
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
the, the, the, the, the pure side ship that we used to use all the time.

835
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
So we were on that ship.

836
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
We were doing just nasty.

837
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
It was just a gas to see go shit all over the point.

838
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
But we were doing.

839
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
We were like moving.

840
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
We'd come up the stern of the ship,

841
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
and then just move as a big group, a big train, like a big.

842
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
And he just asked a question, you know, like,

843
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
well, what if someone's, you know,

844
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
shooting at you?

845
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
And, and everyone was kind of stumped.

846
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Like the older guys in my cartoon were kind of, you know,

847
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000
we shoot back or just some dumb answer, you know,

848
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
like, well, yeah, we shoot back, but meanwhile,

849
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
we all died because we're all in the open on a metal ship.

850
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Yeah.

851
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
And then he taught us, you know, how to do the little bump.

852
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Yeah.

853
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
And, and then I realized, oh, oh, so there's,

854
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
this isn't a, this isn't a recipe.

855
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
It's not like a recipe.

856
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
Oh, this is what you do every time.

857
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Yeah, you can't.

858
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
No, that's, that was probably the guy that made me start thinking,

859
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
oh, there's different ways to do this.

860
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Yeah, it made me start thinking.

861
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Yeah, there's different ways to do this.

862
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
There's things that I need to actually think about.

863
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:48.000
And I can't just, I can't just follow the, the, the, the thing that you've been taught

864
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
one time, and that's how you do it.

865
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
It's like, no, you actually need to think.

866
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000
And that was the first guy that I said that I started to realize,

867
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
there's a lot more going on than I was aware of.

868
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Absolutely.

869
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
There's a lot more.

870
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Oh, a lot more.

871
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000
Yeah.

872
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
It's not just, I mean,

873
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
he would straight down at the range and shoot head plates,

874
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
50 yards like on timer, you know, with his pistol.

875
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Yeah.

876
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Yeah.

877
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Yeah.

878
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Yeah.

879
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000
So, yeah.

880
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000
So that's an awesome LPO to have for your first time around damn.

881
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Year old running mate.

882
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Told me a story.

883
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
You guys were on a bus somewhere on like liberty,

884
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
and some guy was running as mouth, some freak guy was running as mouth,

885
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
and making a bunch of noise.

886
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:53.000
much noise he was all drunk and whatever get crazy and all of a sudden your LPO just like put him in a choke hole and put him to

887
00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:00.68
Yeah, I was like hey, go buddy. Just get a little nap in there. You be all set and what's crazy about that is no one knew what a choke hold

888
00:42:00.68 --> 00:42:05.64
No one knew what a sleeper hold was really he did yeah, and he's like new how to do it

889
00:42:05.64 --> 00:42:12.92
Yeah, and then I put people to sleep and then does it yeah, he's a bass man. Yeah still is he's a great guy

890
00:42:12.92 --> 00:42:19.24
Yeah, freaking awesome anything else that he so what was that first a putton like did you guys is an epitune

891
00:42:19.64 --> 00:42:22.28
The war kicked off while you're in that plundit yeah, so

892
00:42:23.08 --> 00:42:26.44
August first the August second of 1990

893
00:42:27.64 --> 00:42:30.04
Saddam invaded Kuwait and everything blah blah

894
00:42:31.64 --> 00:42:37.64
So they sent puttons from the strand even though they had forward deployed puttons which you guys were past no

895
00:42:37.64 --> 00:42:45.32
Yeah, and so we're on the ark button we didn't leave till April and that like officially didn't end

896
00:42:46.20 --> 00:42:49.96
But everything was done by the time we get there. We didn't we didn't do anything really

897
00:42:50.76 --> 00:42:56.28
You know, the only like real thing I did on that putton was like a

898
00:42:59.24 --> 00:43:01.24
Ship boarding now the

899
00:43:01.24 --> 00:43:09.80
Big 53 helicopters one went down pulled off the ship killed everybody and we we dove on the bodies and pulled it up

900
00:43:10.52 --> 00:43:15.08
But I was with that guy and you know, he was like yeah, yeah, here's how we'll do it totally cool

901
00:43:16.12 --> 00:43:19.000
But that was it we didn't get any gunfire to nothing

902
00:43:20.36 --> 00:43:22.36
Which is unfortunate like

903
00:43:23.32 --> 00:43:27.48
Fuck yeah, so we're on a ship most of the time and

904
00:43:27.48 --> 00:43:33.08
And at least we got off when we did training and summer time deployment if you left in April

905
00:43:33.16 --> 00:43:38.44
Yeah, so it was of it was a 1000 degrees. Oh, yeah, it was terrible and then you know

906
00:43:38.44 --> 00:43:41.40
You can't eat enough and all you did was just like flip weights and

907
00:43:43.80 --> 00:43:47.08
And then wait to get back and then so you get back from that puny

908
00:43:47.08 --> 00:43:50.68
You get your own to write in your next poll today. Yeah, but I got a story about that first one. Oh

909
00:43:51.32 --> 00:43:52.84
I'll work up

910
00:43:52.84 --> 00:43:54.84
Talk about like

911
00:43:54.84 --> 00:43:56.84
Attitude adjustments and stuff

912
00:43:59.64 --> 00:44:05.64
Uh, I kind of fucked up some infraction somewhere. I wasn't late. I just

913
00:44:06.76 --> 00:44:10.52
I didn't have something ready. I don't know what it was but my chief at the time

914
00:44:11.64 --> 00:44:19.80
He's like oh yeah, okay, you fucked up and like oh right, it's chief. I didn't really know I fucked up

915
00:44:19.80 --> 00:44:21.80
I'm okay

916
00:44:21.80 --> 00:44:27.16
So it's like 1600, you know, I don't know if it was Friday. No it was a weekday

917
00:44:29.64 --> 00:44:35.32
And he goes up to the grinder with me and like what's he gonna do like punch me because that

918
00:44:35.88 --> 00:44:42.92
The teams that's kind of like a you know still a thing you know I wouldn't go crying to HR or whatever that is

919
00:44:42.92 --> 00:44:44.92
We don't have that it's just like

920
00:44:45.32 --> 00:44:48.52
Fucking figured out hit each other and be done with it and go back to work

921
00:44:48.52 --> 00:44:51.32
So he's got this bag big

922
00:44:52.20 --> 00:44:54.20
Construction garbage bag, you know

923
00:44:55.24 --> 00:45:03.24
And it's filled with a tangled up flutterboard line. Oh Jesus so if the other those you don't know a flutterboard line is this

924
00:45:04.12 --> 00:45:06.92
Without getting into the whole hydrographic reconnaissance thing

925
00:45:07.72 --> 00:45:14.60
It's parachute cord, you know wine and it's 500 yards worth and it's tangled up like a motherfucker

926
00:45:14.60 --> 00:45:17.40
He goes I want this in the morning

927
00:45:17.40 --> 00:45:19.40
Back on the flutterboard

928
00:45:19.40 --> 00:45:25.08
Jesus, which is like a big fishing reel. Yeah, it's gigantic boards. Yeah, that big

929
00:45:26.28 --> 00:45:31.72
It's bigger than like a gigantic pizza that you ordered. Yeah, that's the diameter. Yeah, whatever that is

930
00:45:32.76 --> 00:45:34.12
I don't know

931
00:45:34.12 --> 00:45:36.12
So I go well this is perfect man

932
00:45:36.76 --> 00:45:42.84
I'll just you know flake it out like a flush fish in line and splite cut it and splice it and as he's walking

933
00:45:42.84 --> 00:45:47.16
I go I'll know if you cut it and splice it like fuck

934
00:45:48.76 --> 00:45:53.24
So you know I did that for a few minutes and realized man, it's gonna take all fucking night

935
00:45:53.40 --> 00:45:56.52
So I went to the country store and I got like a six pack of Budweiser

936
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
I actually got like a 12 pack

937
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:06.20
And I'm sitting there and about five o'clock in the morning. I finished it. Yeah, and I had I I shined the flutterboard

938
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.64
And I put it all and I put it on the chief's desk

939
00:46:09.64 --> 00:46:15.88
And I sat in the in the tuned space, you know with a couple of beers and I kind of like passed out

940
00:46:17.80 --> 00:46:22.60
About six o'clock six fifteen the chief comes in and he's like hey, I'm like oh

941
00:46:23.64 --> 00:46:24.84
He goes

942
00:46:24.84 --> 00:46:26.84
Smacking up and I go you bet

943
00:46:27.56 --> 00:46:31.96
All set chief he's like Roger that good to go good to go we got shit to do let's go

944
00:46:32.84 --> 00:46:34.84
PT Roger

945
00:46:34.84 --> 00:46:36.84
Yeah, I

946
00:46:37.40 --> 00:46:44.92
Good lesson learned that yeah, I don't take all some 550 corda like when it comes off the spool

947
00:46:45.48 --> 00:46:52.20
The car board one one one one more disintegrate whoever ever made that thing is committed a war crime

948
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Just awful

949
00:46:57.24 --> 00:47:01.24
Check so you come back from that deployment after being at sea and

950
00:47:01.24 --> 00:47:04.52
And now you roll into your second pull-to

951
00:47:04.52 --> 00:47:09.72
Yep, did you get any schools when you came back? No, they're just like they were already halfway through the workup

952
00:47:09.72 --> 00:47:14.84
So it was just like I did all the stuff, but I didn't have any time to do anything

953
00:47:14.84 --> 00:47:21.08
Oh, that's right because the arc Patuens were off cycle or off cycle so you're gonna get tossed into some and you were lucky

954
00:47:21.08 --> 00:47:23.96
Then you got tossed into back to the end that was already in their workup. Yeah, yeah

955
00:47:24.84 --> 00:47:26.84
Good to know

956
00:47:26.84 --> 00:47:30.52
Wasn't much going on back then like 92

957
00:47:31.88 --> 00:47:37.96
33 something went in 92 came back 90 to you deployed to the PI with that pull-to

958
00:47:38.60 --> 00:47:43.64
Or you'll put a go on go on and just started so that's where you deployed to yeah

959
00:47:43.72 --> 00:47:45.96
It was like nothing there. I know

960
00:47:46.60 --> 00:47:49.72
Matter of fact it was right it was right in the middle we

961
00:47:52.28 --> 00:47:54.92
We they were just exiting

962
00:47:54.92 --> 00:47:59.56
So we couldn't actually deploy there so we went to Guam

963
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
But there was nothing in Guam like it was

964
00:48:04.04 --> 00:48:09.80
Because my first deployment was to Guam and we were like the first guys to go to Guam

965
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.16
100% like oh you are going to Guam and the guys that had deployed to the PI before

966
00:48:18.44 --> 00:48:20.44
We're just moping around the bear

967
00:48:20.44 --> 00:48:22.44
So

968
00:48:22.60 --> 00:48:25.48
Like I said I was stationed there so yeah, whatever

969
00:48:26.92 --> 00:48:34.04
Hey then was it was the workup standard workup yeah bunch of freaking humpin around the desert yeah like the

970
00:48:34.68 --> 00:48:36.68
Forward leading edge of battle

971
00:48:37.24 --> 00:48:40.52
We had some good guys and trade trading that

972
00:48:41.24 --> 00:48:47.24
Understood more about war than I did that's for danger. Yeah, but it was you know there was not much to

973
00:48:47.24 --> 00:48:54.28
Reflect back on for a lot of guys a guys had to if the guys were dealing with the Vietnam guys and now

974
00:48:55.32 --> 00:49:01.24
Well my first pretend my LPO they were talking about he was in Grenada

975
00:49:01.24 --> 00:49:04.28
Yeah, that's right with damn that with team six and then

976
00:49:05.40 --> 00:49:12.20
My second pretend the chief was in grenade a two with team sex so I had some redundancy in that like warning

977
00:49:12.20 --> 00:49:18.36
But some of it was like oh, I don't know in it crazy though, and that's like

978
00:49:19.40 --> 00:49:24.28
Because I had my platoon commander my second platoon was also in Grenada

979
00:49:24.68 --> 00:49:33.32
Yeah, and every one was you know that was sort of the the and actually I had my LPO in my second platoon was in the first go for and actually did

980
00:49:33.72 --> 00:49:35.72
Yeah gotten some fire fights and

981
00:49:36.84 --> 00:49:37.72
Lc

982
00:49:37.72 --> 00:49:39.72
Yeah, and so so

983
00:49:39.72 --> 00:49:44.60
Those guys it was like they knew the unknown to us, you know, and

984
00:49:45.40 --> 00:49:47.40
That was that's crazy

985
00:49:48.04 --> 00:49:52.76
That there was that little combat experience and the teams back then in the home military

986
00:49:53.08 --> 00:49:54.44
Well, you know the eighties

987
00:49:54.60 --> 00:50:02.60
Yeah, no, that's a lot of sounds and now you go to a seal-patoon every single literally every single guy unless you are a brand new guy every single guy's been

988
00:50:03.16 --> 00:50:05.16
On a combat deployment or seven

989
00:50:05.16 --> 00:50:11.64
You're right, you know or 50 yeah or whatever. Yeah, they're just there's tons of them that are numb to it

990
00:50:12.12 --> 00:50:16.52
You're like we're gonna do this deployment now. That's like we're gonna go somewhere with there's nothing going on

991
00:50:16.52 --> 00:50:18.52
They're like yeah

992
00:50:18.52 --> 00:50:20.68
Because we always used to have a saying like

993
00:50:21.56 --> 00:50:26.12
If you're in a deployment and you're totally at war, that's great

994
00:50:27.96 --> 00:50:32.52
But if you're in a deployment we're just drinking beer and working out and doing exercises

995
00:50:32.52 --> 00:50:42.04
Drink beer workout do exercises do that for the boys who can't do that because guess what it's gonna come full for a circle it always does

996
00:50:42.68 --> 00:50:44.68
You know, but

997
00:50:44.84 --> 00:50:46.84
We're fortunate we we had a

998
00:50:47.80 --> 00:50:52.76
I'm just fortunate like the timeframe I was born totally I mean from

999
00:50:54.20 --> 00:51:00.44
I know everything that happened in the 80s in the war rolled and I went in the service and we still old school and then

1000
00:51:00.44 --> 00:51:02.44
Yeah, the y2k

1001
00:51:04.44 --> 00:51:08.92
Actually, let's let's you know, I learned about the industrial revolution in school

1002
00:51:09.48 --> 00:51:11.48
We really get a fuck the

1003
00:51:12.52 --> 00:51:17.48
Technology revolution cell phones computer. I mean it's yeah, it's changed the world

1004
00:51:18.28 --> 00:51:23.48
Not just the teams that everyday life yeah, and I mean that was weird too because we got to see

1005
00:51:23.48 --> 00:51:26.52
And I know what do you remember? I mean we got to the team there was no email

1006
00:51:26.52 --> 00:51:31.24
Oh, I mean there was no email. There's no computers. There's no email so

1007
00:51:31.72 --> 00:51:39.88
Copy machines. Yeah, we were all the same so my first deployment my first deployment my pulltune commander and the assistant to two commander had each had

1008
00:51:40.44 --> 00:51:43.08
Computer and like no one knew what they were doing

1009
00:51:43.08 --> 00:51:43.72
It's like cool

1010
00:51:43.72 --> 00:51:47.56
That's weren't even you're less they weren't even doing anything on it right it was just

1011
00:51:48.84 --> 00:51:53.88
No, there was no use for him whatsoever and then you know you fast forward. I remember

1012
00:51:53.88 --> 00:52:02.52
Microsoft word or wasn't even Microsoft it was like some other word processing program and then people started doing what you're talking about yeah

1013
00:52:02.52 --> 00:52:04.52
Printigure list. Oh, I had

1014
00:52:04.52 --> 00:52:05.72
Or any execute you

1015
00:52:05.72 --> 00:52:06.52
Drive

1016
00:52:06.52 --> 00:52:08.52
No, all that stuff. I thought I was

1017
00:52:09.48 --> 00:52:14.28
But here's the funny thing about that right like when I went into training

1018
00:52:15.56 --> 00:52:17.56
Like after my seventh pulltune

1019
00:52:18.60 --> 00:52:19.96
They're like oh

1020
00:52:19.96 --> 00:52:23.96
Yeah, you're gonna be the old people with this puttune over at team five

1021
00:52:24.60 --> 00:52:26.60
I'm fast for no a bit but

1022
00:52:26.60 --> 00:52:29.88
No, no, no, you've done enough you're going to the training like fuck

1023
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:37.40
So then it became trade at and I was like plank going over there. Yeah, so I had it put all the way on warfare stuff

1024
00:52:38.04 --> 00:52:39.40
On PowerPoint

1025
00:52:39.40 --> 00:52:43.48
You know and didn't like do it right, you know professional and I just bad

1026
00:52:44.92 --> 00:52:47.48
I never had one minute of formal computer training

1027
00:52:47.48 --> 00:52:53.32
Then they're never gave me any I never asked I just I didn't have to turn on the PC like I had no idea

1028
00:52:53.32 --> 00:52:55.32
I'm like

1029
00:52:55.32 --> 00:52:58.36
Oh inside and then I

1030
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.84
Had to I taught myself how to do it and power point. Okay, can you put power point on this?

1031
00:53:05.40 --> 00:53:08.04
The guy comes over and does it and I'm like

1032
00:53:09.88 --> 00:53:13.80
I asked a few questions and figured it out what are you gonna do? You gotta figure it out

1033
00:53:13.80 --> 00:53:16.12
Yeah, it's like fucking terrible

1034
00:53:16.12 --> 00:53:20.76
I don't know a lot of you know past midnight starting at zero six just going

1035
00:53:21.80 --> 00:53:23.16
You know and I could I could

1036
00:53:24.20 --> 00:53:26.20
Get up go to work

1037
00:53:26.44 --> 00:53:29.08
Do the two miles swim go run six miles

1038
00:53:29.64 --> 00:53:31.64
Whatever the fucking PT was

1039
00:53:31.64 --> 00:53:39.16
Throw my body on run through the house 800 times and go drink a thousand beers and go to bed at midnight sleep four hours and I'd be good to go

1040
00:53:39.16 --> 00:53:44.20
Eight hour day on the computer I can barely make it home in a month

1041
00:53:46.12 --> 00:53:48.12
Kills me

1042
00:53:48.12 --> 00:53:53.08
Terrible I don't know how these one of these fuckers who've sitting cubicles like blow the brains out

1043
00:53:53.96 --> 00:53:59.24
After like 10 years, you know the business suit and they're all like overweight and high blood brush

1044
00:53:59.24 --> 00:54:01.24
You're like

1045
00:54:01.24 --> 00:54:09.56
I totally can see it. That's no way for a human being you you have to get out of the cubicle man. Oh my god. I'm like headbutton

1046
00:54:09.56 --> 00:54:15.64
The mirror that was yeah, being the teams where you're at a minimum you worked out in the morning

1047
00:54:16.12 --> 00:54:23.000
And at lunchtime you're gonna go like for a run on the beach or you're gonna go do your jitsu or you're gonna go freaking do rope climbs or

1048
00:54:23.24 --> 00:54:25.24
Something at lunch and

1049
00:54:25.24 --> 00:54:30.68
And that's just the way yeah like think about the fact that when you go when you're in the teams

1050
00:54:30.68 --> 00:54:36.60
You you work out every day every day like that's just awesome right and that's your not working out

1051
00:54:36.68 --> 00:54:41.72
You're doing everything we do in the teams is working out. Yeah. Yeah, so like okay

1052
00:54:41.72 --> 00:54:46.92
Well, I'm not gonna pee too. Oh, you're not gonna fucking pee. I'm climbing the ships all day

1053
00:54:47.48 --> 00:54:50.60
You know if that ain't working out. I don't know what the fuck is you know

1054
00:54:51.16 --> 00:54:58.04
Yeah, yeah, if you're in one of those jobs where you are staring at a computer all day long or you're sitting inside all time

1055
00:54:58.04 --> 00:55:06.12
You got to you got to get up and move. I absolutely so back to your second pull tune or going what are we forward to your second

1056
00:55:06.12 --> 00:55:08.12
Second pull tune

1057
00:55:08.12 --> 00:55:10.12
Was there any major

1058
00:55:10.12 --> 00:55:17.64
Leadership lessons that you learned in your second pollute and I didn't really ask you that question about your first pull tune when you because I imagined your LPO

1059
00:55:18.20 --> 00:55:24.50
Must have left such like it not like a hey here's four points on how to lead, but you just watch that guy

1060
00:55:24.50 --> 00:55:29.54
I just yeah, that's any lady. That's well the cat you're talking about

1061
00:55:30.58 --> 00:55:34.86
I don't know how he was like your OIC yeah, we know what we're talking about

1062
00:55:35.22 --> 00:55:39.14
He's like just do what that guy does do I and you're in your all set

1063
00:55:39.14 --> 00:55:45.22
I spent my whole career trying to emulate that guy. Yeah, everything about him and I did a crappy job

1064
00:55:45.22 --> 00:55:55.46
But I did the best I could do you know, but my second puttune I

1065
00:55:55.62 --> 00:55:57.14
Don't know I

1066
00:55:57.14 --> 00:56:01.38
We didn't like there was no major like conflicts not even close to

1067
00:56:02.18 --> 00:56:04.18
We did some exercise. We had a good time

1068
00:56:04.58 --> 00:56:09.30
Tiling Australia got in a lot of like barfates and

1069
00:56:10.50 --> 00:56:13.46
You know, I mean we didn't kind of went by

1070
00:56:13.46 --> 00:56:18.98
Yeah, and I had a lot of fun. Yeah, and learn I learned I don't know I

1071
00:56:20.18 --> 00:56:22.18
Improved on my

1072
00:56:23.54 --> 00:56:30.02
My shooting skills in your second puttune in my second tune not a ton but a little bit

1073
00:56:30.42 --> 00:56:33.06
And I'll get more into that as we go along, but

1074
00:56:34.02 --> 00:56:38.34
It was all right doing a puttune is that period of time period of puttunes

1075
00:56:38.34 --> 00:56:46.26
Which I did one deployment to Guam in that time period but you could see what was happening and what was happening was

1076
00:56:46.82 --> 00:56:51.30
It was a pretty cookie cutter thing like you're gonna do work up you're gonna go on to Guam

1077
00:56:51.30 --> 00:56:54.18
You're gonna do some exercises you're gonna come home and you're gonna do that again

1078
00:56:54.26 --> 00:56:56.82
That's actually why I went and did a couple of arms because

1079
00:56:57.30 --> 00:57:02.74
It seemed like different. Yeah, they they had a little better chance it seemed of doing something real

1080
00:57:02.74 --> 00:57:10.10
And that's why I did a couple of arms with a couple other guys, but uh, but yeah, it seemed like it's kind of cookie cutter

1081
00:57:10.10 --> 00:57:13.94
Hey, you're gonna do work up you're gonna do and you're learning stuff you're getting better at it, but

1082
00:57:14.74 --> 00:57:19.70
That's about it. That is exactly about it and now that I look back at it

1083
00:57:20.18 --> 00:57:22.18
Some of the people who were in charge of me

1084
00:57:22.90 --> 00:57:25.70
You know, what are they or OIC's, LPO's of cheese

1085
00:57:25.70 --> 00:57:34.58
It's hindsight's 2020, but they didn't really do many favors. They didn't have a lot of forward thinking

1086
00:57:35.46 --> 00:57:41.54
And I hate to say it, but some of them like wow, let's just get through this deployment and like get through it

1087
00:57:41.86 --> 00:57:44.26
This is like my whole life like

1088
00:57:45.38 --> 00:57:49.70
I don't care if I ever go home, you know, this is what I do this is our profession, you know, and

1089
00:57:49.70 --> 00:57:57.62
And I would hold some ammon animosity towards on that piss me off basically did it seem to you

1090
00:57:59.38 --> 00:58:02.66
Like it seemed to me well as it was just from what you just said

1091
00:58:03.86 --> 00:58:08.18
I think that there were some guys in the teams at that time period

1092
00:58:09.22 --> 00:58:12.74
That were not thinking at all that we were going to war

1093
00:58:12.74 --> 00:58:19.94
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. They just want to do this so they could punch that ticket to make rank. Yeah, but they were they were not thinking

1094
00:58:20.90 --> 00:58:22.90
Hey, there's a war on the horizon

1095
00:58:23.30 --> 00:58:27.22
Okay, we need to be ready for combat. We need to improve our skills

1096
00:58:27.78 --> 00:58:32.82
There was definitely guys in the teams in the nineties that were

1097
00:58:33.78 --> 00:58:35.06
Just

1098
00:58:35.06 --> 00:58:39.30
You know, there were some great guys too, obviously, but there was plenty of guys that were hey

1099
00:58:39.30 --> 00:58:44.34
Yep, we're gonna go on this deployment. This is what I have to do hey stay out of trouble. Right?

1100
00:58:44.34 --> 00:58:50.18
Yeah, are we gonna set up any extra training? No, no, no, we'll just train it when we don't have to train we won't

1101
00:58:50.18 --> 00:58:52.18
It was like well, yeah

1102
00:58:52.82 --> 00:58:55.86
Because if you don't make us train we're gonna go train out in the bars

1103
00:58:56.90 --> 00:59:01.22
We're getting big this fight and brick chairs where people had and getting trouble

1104
00:59:01.86 --> 00:59:04.90
Which I don't know why he getting trouble. I still think like oh, yeah, okay

1105
00:59:04.90 --> 00:59:12.90
Oh, Barpla. Yeah, don't do it again. I never got anybody trouble for that like that would be like yeah cool

1106
00:59:13.78 --> 00:59:16.74
Don't don't don't be disrespectful to cops

1107
00:59:17.38 --> 00:59:19.38
But you know come on

1108
00:59:20.18 --> 00:59:24.10
You look lock guys up on an island for six months. Yeah, and then go oh

1109
00:59:24.74 --> 00:59:26.82
You know go home and you know

1110
00:59:27.14 --> 00:59:30.74
What no, we're not we're not jobs. That's what

1111
00:59:30.74 --> 00:59:35.38
Taxpayers pay us for to be wild and crazy so when all that

1112
00:59:35.38 --> 00:59:37.38
No, happens we're like right at all

1113
00:59:38.10 --> 00:59:40.10
That's what that's what we do

1114
00:59:40.98 --> 00:59:44.66
So that so that pollton you do you do it's cookie cutter

1115
00:59:45.38 --> 00:59:51.62
And then your next book your next pollton after that where you the LPO next pollton after that you did another pollton

1116
00:59:51.62 --> 00:59:54.26
Well the second pollton I gave up the machine gun

1117
00:59:55.06 --> 00:59:58.82
And we did that one pollton and then I became a point man. Okay

1118
00:59:58.82 --> 01:00:02.82
That's what kind of what I wanted like that kind of takes the blinder's off

1119
01:00:03.38 --> 01:00:05.38
And I became a point man

1120
01:00:05.78 --> 01:00:12.50
Was either best point man? No was either best at anything in the teams? No ever in the history of ever nothing

1121
01:00:13.14 --> 01:00:17.38
But I was decent point man. I'd say it was average and

1122
01:00:18.18 --> 01:00:20.18
And

1123
01:00:21.38 --> 01:00:21.38
I

1124
01:00:21.38 --> 01:00:25.30
Did that the next five potentials unless I was in a leadership position

1125
01:00:25.30 --> 01:00:30.18
Mm-hmm. Oh, I did my third pollton was a point man

1126
01:00:30.90 --> 01:00:38.18
Wait your second pollton was point man or second two okay, so you gave up machine gun after your first pollton and now your second pollton point man

1127
01:00:38.42 --> 01:00:43.22
Third pollton point man, yep, which means you're getting really good at land nav

1128
01:00:43.78 --> 01:00:49.62
And we didn't have GPS and your pace count is on

1129
01:00:49.62 --> 01:00:54.98
That 7,000 yards in my head not a like counter nothing just yeah, Roger

1130
01:00:56.02 --> 01:00:59.86
You know and I got real good. That was pretty good at land nav anyway

1131
01:00:59.86 --> 01:01:05.38
But when did you go to sniper school my third put them so in your third pollton work up you go to sniper school

1132
01:01:05.46 --> 01:01:10.10
Which sniper school was it an NSW sniper at the time? Yeah, I must have been in one of the early ones

1133
01:01:10.10 --> 01:01:14.74
Yeah, it was not not the earliest one so it was squirt away. It was awesome, man

1134
01:01:14.74 --> 01:01:22.74
We did like a couple days of classes and then we went up to Klinga, California and

1135
01:01:23.70 --> 01:01:30.74
That's one of my shooting my long gun shooting just became insane. Oh, yeah, first. So all right, you know sniper school

1136
01:01:30.74 --> 01:01:33.62
You know where's my cool sniper weapons now?

1137
01:01:34.58 --> 01:01:36.58
Iron site M14

1138
01:01:37.38 --> 01:01:40.98
For like two weeks straight at a thousand inches

1139
01:01:40.98 --> 01:01:42.98
So after a while

1140
01:01:45.06 --> 01:01:54.10
This is your group size of a quarter 20 rounds. This is your group and then you start shooting for distance calling wind

1141
01:01:54.66 --> 01:01:59.30
Still with iron sights iron sights. I'm saying finally they break you into the scope

1142
01:02:00.02 --> 01:02:02.18
When they start teaching how to you know mills

1143
01:02:03.14 --> 01:02:08.34
How to range targets. We didn't have the laser range find this

1144
01:02:08.34 --> 01:02:11.94
So when you finally get all that stuff. I mean

1145
01:02:12.90 --> 01:02:14.90
You're such a good shooter

1146
01:02:14.90 --> 01:02:19.62
I got out of sniper school and my platoon. We did a pistol shoot me and my shooting buddy

1147
01:02:20.50 --> 01:02:25.30
You know Z they're not Z, but that's his initial ZJ

1148
01:02:26.26 --> 01:02:28.26
We smoked everybody

1149
01:02:28.26 --> 01:02:34.58
Just because we could shoot and they just got back from like Rogers like yeah, yeah, but and that really really

1150
01:02:34.58 --> 01:02:40.10
Like I became a really good long-unch you like awesome

1151
01:02:41.38 --> 01:02:43.38
Yeah, I've been shooting archery and

1152
01:02:44.26 --> 01:02:52.42
Man the laser range finder they're freaking crazy. Oh my god. They're the best they can take in everything. They're crazy

1153
01:02:52.98 --> 01:02:56.10
Yeah, I mean I bought one I'll take all I'm just gonna buy one

1154
01:02:56.66 --> 01:03:03.54
They're guy like he's like I'm like which one's the best one that that's one and I was like okay cool. It's compensating for angle and just real quick

1155
01:03:03.54 --> 01:03:06.34
I was two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago

1156
01:03:06.90 --> 01:03:14.18
I was an arrow range officer they call it, but it's a range safety officer at the Wyoming

1157
01:03:15.06 --> 01:03:18.58
Right rifle tactical championship. Yep Wyoming

1158
01:03:19.62 --> 01:03:22.58
Some of these range finders these guys that are like

1159
01:03:23.30 --> 01:03:26.10
Incredible and a shout out to them guys

1160
01:03:26.10 --> 01:03:30.66
There are some of the best shooters I've ever seen in my life like in the world

1161
01:03:30.66 --> 01:03:34.66
Good competition. It's called the Wyoming

1162
01:03:35.46 --> 01:03:38.50
WRTC Wyoming rifle tactical championship or

1163
01:03:39.22 --> 01:03:43.86
or WTRC I can't remember excuse me if I fuck it up. That's just the way I am

1164
01:03:44.82 --> 01:03:48.58
But it's also a fundraiser for special operations wounded warriors

1165
01:03:49.46 --> 01:03:51.30
Some of the best people in the planet man

1166
01:03:52.26 --> 01:03:54.98
Awesome, but some of the girls like holy fuck

1167
01:03:54.98 --> 01:04:00.34
You know but I had this back in the day that has saved me like I don't know

1168
01:04:01.14 --> 01:04:05.46
700 hours of horseshit in my life, you know, but yeah

1169
01:04:06.74 --> 01:04:12.42
Time but yeah, I became a really good shot this range friend or I have as a stabilizer on it too

1170
01:04:12.42 --> 01:04:16.74
Well, because it's like you're not like shaking and the only thing it doesn't do is like pull the

1171
01:04:17.14 --> 01:04:22.18
Trigger give you a blow job and shoot the gun for you. I mean, it's it's like crazy

1172
01:04:22.18 --> 01:04:27.62
Yeah, so you search so that's when you went to sniper school and you did that that sniper school was the

1173
01:04:28.50 --> 01:04:32.82
NSW with the stocking in all that yeah, yeah, I was hot. It wasn't easy

1174
01:04:33.78 --> 01:04:36.98
Wasn't easy at all how many people graduated that school? I

1175
01:04:38.34 --> 01:04:40.34
Can't remember there was I

1176
01:04:41.22 --> 01:04:45.22
Wasn't like the like the talk cat, but I think we had a

1177
01:04:46.42 --> 01:04:47.94
10

1178
01:04:47.94 --> 01:04:56.58
Maybe 15 man NSW came out of the gate hardcore on that school. Yeah, yeah, they did like that NSW sniper school

1179
01:04:56.58 --> 01:05:04.34
It's legit freaking legit. Yeah, it's not easy. Yeah, but I like I loved it. I mean, I thought it was awesome

1180
01:05:05.14 --> 01:05:09.62
So then you go on to point with that where'd you go? It's another quantum deployment yeah, it was there's another

1181
01:05:09.62 --> 01:05:17.38
Insignificant not that it wasn't great and everything but it was no yeah, yeah, I mean

1182
01:05:17.38 --> 01:05:21.14
That's what people have to understand and the 90s it was like you're going on deployment

1183
01:05:21.54 --> 01:05:28.10
We're on standby for whatever praying every day that a major theater war would break out

1184
01:05:29.22 --> 01:05:33.62
Yeah, I mean just hoping but the one thing we did do is we

1185
01:05:33.62 --> 01:05:39.78
I'm sorry I got a backtrack one putton. We were in Australia working with the SDS and

1186
01:05:41.86 --> 01:05:43.86
Shoot in the shit and

1187
01:05:44.26 --> 01:05:47.06
We were we were doing some training or doing some shooting

1188
01:05:48.42 --> 01:05:51.94
Our guys were doing really really well like shooting wise and

1189
01:05:52.98 --> 01:06:00.10
Course with those cats who are awesome like the best guys out of you know just like a bunch of special forces around the world

1190
01:06:00.10 --> 01:06:05.14
That's guys ever like oh yeah, you guys man you're shooting a shit out of it mate

1191
01:06:06.10 --> 01:06:10.34
And he goes well, it's easy for you and I'm like the fuck you talking about

1192
01:06:12.74 --> 01:06:19.46
You guys grow up playing freaking cowboys and army and and I'm like I never really thought of it

1193
01:06:20.02 --> 01:06:22.82
He goes you know back to them like we don't have guns here

1194
01:06:24.10 --> 01:06:28.98
They like don't have guns unless you got a special permit to hunt or you're joining the military or the cops

1195
01:06:28.98 --> 01:06:30.98
We don't grow up doing that

1196
01:06:31.78 --> 01:06:37.30
You know I'm like never thought of it, you know that Christ be begun wars when your kids and God

1197
01:06:37.54 --> 01:06:40.90
You know just throwing rocks. Yeah, that's have a rock fight. What?

1198
01:06:41.78 --> 01:06:43.78
You know so

1199
01:06:46.02 --> 01:06:48.02
Yeah, you don't think too much about the fact that

1200
01:06:49.06 --> 01:06:54.18
Many of the people that come into the teams or into in the military they grew up with a rifle

1201
01:06:54.18 --> 01:07:00.26
Or yeah, it's comfortable around God. Yeah, I mean I don't see any reason to be afraid of a gun

1202
01:07:01.38 --> 01:07:02.98
No, unless you're an idiot

1203
01:07:02.98 --> 01:07:09.86
Yeah, then you should be afraid of it. Yeah, because you're too yourself. Right, but that and then my third patoon

1204
01:07:10.34 --> 01:07:12.34
We like said we didn't

1205
01:07:12.50 --> 01:07:20.18
When we see he's did some stop and yeah, just you know like but people don't realize and then years when there was no wars going on

1206
01:07:20.18 --> 01:07:25.46
We did some like ridiculous training stuff. Yeah, okay

1207
01:07:25.46 --> 01:07:31.38
We're gonna do like this three miles swim and then put your gear on and hump you know walk like

1208
01:07:32.10 --> 01:07:35.14
I don't know here to Saskatchewan and then

1209
01:07:36.10 --> 01:07:41.70
And then you got a five minute break and then you got a shoot like 17 rounds and two seconds and

1210
01:07:42.74 --> 01:07:44.74
Like really

1211
01:07:44.74 --> 01:07:46.74
I mean I was skinny. Do you want me to be

1212
01:07:46.74 --> 01:07:52.58
You know like five miles swim like 10 mile run and then two miles swim like

1213
01:07:54.10 --> 01:07:56.74
Dude like it takes all day

1214
01:07:58.74 --> 01:08:02.58
Doing the monster mash is fried in I mean they were fun. Yeah, they were fun

1215
01:08:02.58 --> 01:08:09.38
But yeah, and that's the other thing is I have occasionally people ask me they say something along the lines of

1216
01:08:10.26 --> 01:08:16.02
I was in the Marine Corps. I was in the army. I was in the navy during the 90s and didn't do anything

1217
01:08:16.02 --> 01:08:23.30
And I feel like I didn't do a good job serving my country. No, is that look man? You served you country you did what your country needed you to do and when it was

1218
01:08:24.02 --> 01:08:25.38
1994 or

1219
01:08:25.38 --> 01:08:29.70
1996 and you were in the sealed teams and the navy needed you to deploy to wherever and

1220
01:08:30.26 --> 01:08:35.94
Go do an exercise with some country like that's what you did and and we trained and we did

1221
01:08:37.22 --> 01:08:43.62
We did establish and maintain standard operating procedures. So all these little things that we do you know like

1222
01:08:43.62 --> 01:08:48.74
They came out they they they somebody had to carry the thread of

1223
01:08:49.70 --> 01:08:56.74
Being able to do this stuff all right for during these time periods and that's what that's what we were doing

1224
01:08:56.74 --> 01:08:59.38
You know make making sure that this thread

1225
01:09:00.18 --> 01:09:08.42
Making sure that the knowledge at least at a minimum level stayed in place and a lot of it is not even the tactics and stop it's the

1226
01:09:08.42 --> 01:09:12.66
I don't know and it still teams I think

1227
01:09:14.02 --> 01:09:16.90
The world the word like phrase old school

1228
01:09:18.02 --> 01:09:20.02
has to always be there

1229
01:09:20.74 --> 01:09:27.78
It has to they're like just beat you up through everything or that's not an old school thing just just that attitude like you got a

1230
01:09:29.14 --> 01:09:35.62
At least every day and a silver tune still true salt team whatever you're talking about someone's got to be like

1231
01:09:35.62 --> 01:09:40.98
Don't be a fucking pussy just do it and shut the buck up

1232
01:09:41.62 --> 01:09:45.22
Yeah, because if it ain't like that in the most exclusive man's club ever

1233
01:09:46.10 --> 01:09:51.22
Then then what what do you got you got you got nothing? Yeah, there's definitely

1234
01:09:51.62 --> 01:09:54.58
You definitely have to maintain that attitude of

1235
01:09:55.54 --> 01:10:01.46
Hey, we're gonna do we're gonna do we're gonna we're gonna get this done. Oh, yeah, that's what we're gonna do we're gonna get this done and it's like

1236
01:10:01.78 --> 01:10:03.78
Cool, man. This is gonna really suck

1237
01:10:03.78 --> 01:10:10.34
Yes, things that are gonna suck real bad because if you don't do it even if you're operating here in the town

1238
01:10:10.34 --> 01:10:12.02
Whatever you're doing

1239
01:10:12.02 --> 01:10:16.34
If you're not doing a gut check like a serious gut check every

1240
01:10:17.30 --> 01:10:19.30
Two months or so

1241
01:10:19.30 --> 01:10:25.46
Somers wrong it shouldn't be easy no it shouldn't it should be like fuck this is gonna suck

1242
01:10:26.18 --> 01:10:30.42
But then when you're doing it it sucks so bad. It's fun because you what your chums

1243
01:10:30.42 --> 01:10:35.70
You're like yeah, whatever everything's good no one no one ever says anything about it you just like

1244
01:10:38.26 --> 01:10:42.74
Because you go because you think about some of these things that you do you get in you jump

1245
01:10:43.30 --> 01:10:46.02
You jump into the ocean with a zodiac

1246
01:10:46.98 --> 01:10:51.86
And then you get in the zodiac and you rig it and it's freezing and you're in a wetsuit

1247
01:10:51.86 --> 01:11:01.46
That's cold and now you drive from over the horizon so it's 15 or 20 miles of driving in a zodiac against the swell against the swells you're getting beat up

1248
01:11:02.18 --> 01:11:04.18
Your ass is chafed

1249
01:11:04.18 --> 01:11:10.82
Yeah, the guy next to you is puking and and what you're doing is you're getting to a harbor somewhere

1250
01:11:11.38 --> 01:11:12.74
So you can then

1251
01:11:12.74 --> 01:11:16.58
Put on your do the real or take your dive rig out of a kit bag

1252
01:11:16.58 --> 01:11:25.30
Yeah, do you like a cursory check on your dive rig to see if it got damaged on the jump and then you put that thing on

1253
01:11:25.30 --> 01:11:33.46
You're freaking it's all awkward and huge and and then you roll into the water and then you're underwater for three and a half hours

1254
01:11:33.86 --> 01:11:38.58
Next to some idiot who doesn't know where he is and you're freezing

1255
01:11:38.58 --> 01:11:45.70
When you get into water you're freezing you're hoping that you you're actually happy when you get in the water because then you know you're gonna warm up the light two minutes because you're gonna be kicking

1256
01:11:46.42 --> 01:11:49.38
And then you get done with that you come back out

1257
01:11:49.62 --> 01:11:53.54
You're got you turn on a fire our strobe or an IR our strobe

1258
01:11:53.54 --> 01:11:58.50
Sometimes a white strobe because no one's out there note there's no enemy gonna see you because you're in the middle of the ocean

1259
01:11:59.22 --> 01:12:01.70
Yeah, then you get picked up

1260
01:12:01.70 --> 01:12:10.10
You climb back in your totally exhausted you have one of those collapsible canteen like the two-quarter team is in the bottom of your kit bag

1261
01:12:10.82 --> 01:12:14.82
Pull that thing out you drink some of that. I pull it out. I got punctured

1262
01:12:14.82 --> 01:12:15.62
Yeah, I got punctured

1263
01:12:15.62 --> 01:12:17.62
So I'm just like I just go

1264
01:12:18.34 --> 01:12:23.22
I got nothing and then you got to drive another 15 miles back over the horizon

1265
01:12:23.22 --> 01:12:26.26
Yeah, and and and about you have about

1266
01:12:27.14 --> 01:12:29.38
Seven miles left the sun starts coming up

1267
01:12:29.70 --> 01:12:30.90
Yeah

1268
01:12:30.90 --> 01:12:34.98
Then you get there and then you get loaded into some some LCU

1269
01:12:34.98 --> 01:12:36.98
That was a VW out there

1270
01:12:37.38 --> 01:12:40.66
So that's the kind of that yeah, like that's just that just socks, man

1271
01:12:41.06 --> 01:12:42.58
Yeah, yeah, you used to it. Yeah, I don't know

1272
01:12:43.54 --> 01:12:49.94
All right, so that's your so your third puttune your fourth puttune what about your fifth puttune my fourth not my fourth puttune

1273
01:12:50.74 --> 01:12:56.58
I was LPO there you go your second class LPO I was just so I think about that for those of you don't know what that means

1274
01:12:56.58 --> 01:12:58.58
You're the second class pedi officer

1275
01:12:58.58 --> 01:13:01.62
LPO's are usually

1276
01:13:02.50 --> 01:13:08.98
supposed to be first classes and now everyone in a puttune is like a first class right back in those days

1277
01:13:09.30 --> 01:13:13.30
Man there was E3Z4's E5's and then you'd have an LPO

1278
01:13:13.62 --> 01:13:18.66
but you were the LPO as an E5. Yep. How was that?

1279
01:13:20.10 --> 01:13:22.10
I loved it, you know

1280
01:13:23.54 --> 01:13:25.86
my cheap was a senior cheat

1281
01:13:25.86 --> 01:13:27.86

1282
01:13:27.86 --> 01:13:31.06
God rest his soul my gehankel died

01:13:52.50 --> 01:13:56.50
Again, we didn't we didn't really do anything no

1290
01:13:57.22 --> 01:14:04.34
Made no water like being like actually in charge. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I

1294
01:14:17.70 --> 01:14:19.86
and there's a couple E6's in the puttune too

1295

They were newer guys so they didn't oh so you were the E5 LPO

1296
01:14:26.34 --> 01:14:27.54

Bossing around whatever in charge of guys that were senior to you on paper because they'd come

But I transferred to silt team five after that and

1309
01:15:27.78 --> 01:15:30.10
At that time silt team five seemed like a

1310
01:15:30.98 --> 01:15:32.98
Oh it seemed like it had a

1311
01:15:33.54 --> 01:15:36.02
little less stringent oh my god

1319
01:16:15.54 --> 01:16:20.34
And then the back gate opens like coming out of the Drew carry show back in the 80s like

1320
01:16:20.90 --> 01:16:24.82
Guys run skateboards nobody's wearing a uniform on him give a fuck

1321
01:16:24.82 --> 01:16:30.50
And they're like hey, what's going on yeah, blah, blah, blah, what do we do repeat to you?

1322
01:16:30.50 --> 01:16:34.90
I don't know who cares just go run and I don't know I'll hit the gem

1323
01:16:35.78 --> 01:16:37.78
Like what the fuck is going on here?

1324
01:16:38.34 --> 01:16:41.22
Everything was loose everybody was wicked cool

1325
01:16:42.34 --> 01:16:45.46
So I'm like but then when I started working with everybody

1326
01:16:46.98 --> 01:16:51.86
The square away nest was there and the training department in the patoon's they just

1327
01:16:51.86 --> 01:16:55.38
Proved that you don't need to be like

1328
01:16:56.98 --> 01:16:59.62
So uniform and standards me

1329
01:17:00.82 --> 01:17:08.02
That and still be good operator. I mean those guys were the best I love the being at silting five I love being at all my teams, but

1330
01:17:09.14 --> 01:17:14.18
You know that was that was fun. Yeah, there was a bunch of guys that migrated from team one down to

1331
01:17:14.18 --> 01:17:16.18
Oh absolutely

1332
01:17:16.90 --> 01:17:19.14
So I got an up a tune there and it was another arg

1333
01:17:19.14 --> 01:17:22.02
So this was my fifth patoon and I did art

1334
01:17:22.66 --> 01:17:25.22
But we had a great and did they make you the opio?

1335
01:17:25.78 --> 01:17:30.42
Oh no, no, I did three more patoons not being the opio after

1336
01:17:30.42 --> 01:17:35.78
Yeah, yeah, that's kind of an interesting deal as you kind of knew how to run shit

1337
01:17:35.78 --> 01:17:37.78
still any five yeah

1338
01:17:38.34 --> 01:17:40.34
So we did the arg and and

1339
01:17:42.42 --> 01:17:44.42
We uh we went overseas

1340
01:17:46.02 --> 01:17:48.02
again we did like

1341
01:17:48.02 --> 01:17:50.02
Some watch

1342
01:17:50.02 --> 01:17:57.46
and quate they still had that thing where guys are doing ISR or whatever but nothing major and we didn't do anything

1343
01:17:58.34 --> 01:18:00.34
But uh

1344
01:18:00.34 --> 01:18:08.26
It sucked like I was on another hard and I was like man. This is this is fucked up. I'm like I'm getting

1345
01:18:08.26 --> 01:18:11.30
I had just re-enlisted

1346
01:18:11.30 --> 01:18:15.78
I went over like 10 years so I'm like okay. I'm committed for 20 now, you know

1347
01:18:15.78 --> 01:18:21.06
You know you can only work out so much and you're only drink so much you know

1348
01:18:21.06 --> 01:18:23.06
It's getting stagnant

1349
01:18:24.34 --> 01:18:26.34
But when I came back

1350
01:18:26.98 --> 01:18:28.98
they had this

1351
01:18:30.42 --> 01:18:32.82
That the cap the command of advancement

1352
01:18:32.82 --> 01:18:34.02
Oh yeah

1353
01:18:34.58 --> 01:18:37.54
So there's 52 e5s at

1354
01:18:37.54 --> 01:18:39.54
SIL team five

1355
01:18:39.54 --> 01:18:42.26
And what they'll do is they'll just instead of taking a test they'll just

1356
01:18:42.26 --> 01:18:48.18
Make you any six and you get paid right away. It was a big it's kind of a big thing

1357
01:18:48.74 --> 01:18:51.54
So out of 52 e5s I was ranked number one

1358
01:18:53.14 --> 01:18:55.14
So I got the cap

1359
01:18:55.94 --> 01:19:02.10
So when TD was a CO I walked in there and we were talking and I was doing me in diamond

1360
01:19:02.90 --> 01:19:05.38
God bless my brother diamond he died last year

1361
01:19:07.06 --> 01:19:08.10
And I go

1362
01:19:08.10 --> 01:19:14.98
Fuck you you give it the diamond he's got a wife and kid I'll get a next year or I won't ever get it

1363
01:19:15.94 --> 01:19:19.78
So diamond got it and I was like yeah and he bought the bill so what's the difference

1364
01:19:21.30 --> 01:19:26.18
So it was all good to go but I was like I don't care about rank. I never did

1365
01:19:26.98 --> 01:19:32.66
So I did that and you know I thought it was cool. That is that's awesome. What uh

1366
01:19:32.66 --> 01:19:40.34
Did you get cap the next year? Yes, sir. I did they used to tell me that I got caped

1367
01:19:41.62 --> 01:19:47.62
My whole career because I did because I got capped it because I I got capped to E5 and then I got capped to answer

1368
01:19:47.94 --> 01:19:53.78
Yeah purpose right because you went in the program. Yeah, but that that our opportunity

1369
01:19:53.78 --> 01:19:56.50
We had a grape tune like one two

1370
01:19:57.46 --> 01:20:00.58
Three four of those guys are not with us anymore

1371
01:20:00.58 --> 01:20:04.02
And not one of them is from a combat thing

1372
01:20:05.30 --> 01:20:08.82
You know natural causebees are self-inputed

1373
01:20:09.94 --> 01:20:11.94
You know

1374
01:20:12.10 --> 01:20:17.62
But it was a good it was a great tune. We had a lot of fun. We had a lot of terrible times, but

1375
01:20:18.66 --> 01:20:20.66
You know

1376
01:20:20.66 --> 01:20:26.18
You have terrible times but they're fun when you're fun people that just are having fun so that platoon

1377
01:20:26.18 --> 01:20:29.14
My opio I don't know if you're still in

1378
01:20:29.86 --> 01:20:35.94
pH. I don't know he was awesome. He he was great

1379
01:20:37.62 --> 01:20:39.62
My I had two chiefs in that tune

1380
01:20:40.58 --> 01:20:46.18
One like gave up or got fired or something and all this time

1381
01:20:49.14 --> 01:20:51.14
I had chiefs said gave me some good advice

1382
01:20:51.14 --> 01:20:58.50
Like my third platoon J. H was the chief and he was in buzz with me. He was a higher rank

1383
01:20:59.30 --> 01:21:01.86
So he had kind of a tough go at it when he got to the teams

1384
01:21:02.34 --> 01:21:04.58
But he turned out to be one of my best platoon chiefs

1385
01:21:05.22 --> 01:21:10.82
He was smart or secular you know him. He was cool too. You know just he didn't

1386
01:21:11.94 --> 01:21:17.30
Offer me a lot of advice tactically because we kind of grew up at the same time so was you know we're both

1387
01:21:17.30 --> 01:21:26.66
Same level but he was good with the navy like he told me this and that taught me shit that I forgot but it was good to know you know

1388
01:21:27.94 --> 01:21:32.98
But a lot of the examples I used as a platoon chief that I drew on

1389
01:21:33.78 --> 01:21:35.78
We're mostly bad

1390
01:21:35.78 --> 01:21:37.78
I'd have to say

1391
01:21:37.78 --> 01:21:40.82
You know 51% of them were whatnot to do and

1392
01:21:40.82 --> 01:21:47.22
You were looking at him at the time saying that that's not a good move or were you looking at it or did you figure out later that chief?

1393
01:21:47.62 --> 01:21:53.14
Wasn't doing a good thing. I remember doing one thing. We're doing this crazy ship boring thing and I'm like yeah, let's do it again

1394
01:21:53.14 --> 01:21:55.86
I can you know we're not there yet. We're not good at it

1395
01:21:56.90 --> 01:22:00.90
And my chiefs like well, yeah, the confident guys are gonna say that to me

1396
01:22:01.78 --> 01:22:05.86
What the fuck what now all of a sudden there's two groups like the confident and the non-cut

1397
01:22:05.86 --> 01:22:09.54
We're fucking frogman what do you mean non-confident what is that?

1398
01:22:09.54 --> 01:22:14.18
Like yeah, I'm not that way when I look at a fucking computer or something but

1399
01:22:15.14 --> 01:22:18.18
Like in the teams who's who's not confident?

1400
01:22:18.18 --> 01:22:23.30
Yeah, that is a serious like okay. I'm never gonna say that ever in the history of ever

1401
01:22:24.42 --> 01:22:26.42
Like ever

1402
01:22:27.22 --> 01:22:30.58
So then so then what point did you go into trading?

1403
01:22:31.38 --> 01:22:34.10
Oh, I still got a couple tunes to go over here damn bro

1404
01:22:34.10 --> 01:22:40.42
Yeah, so your fifth-platoon was the art cartoon. Yeah, you step down from out where you you will not the op-pl right

1405
01:22:40.66 --> 01:22:46.26
So now you do your six-platoon yep and what are you doing in the sixth-platoon point man again point man a rep

1406
01:22:47.46 --> 01:22:49.46
Point man a rep yep

1407
01:22:50.34 --> 01:22:54.10
And yeah, that was a speck-ops deployment to go on yeah

1408
01:22:55.30 --> 01:22:58.58
Hammered it now get to work out to get your work up done

1409
01:22:59.30 --> 01:23:00.26
Yep

1410
01:23:00.26 --> 01:23:05.46
Land warfare CQC yep long-humps in the desert yeah

1411
01:23:06.50 --> 01:23:09.06
Oh, arey oh yeah big time

1412
01:23:10.18 --> 01:23:15.54
By then I knew nylon so well like it was like yeah, okay. Yeah, I'm the point man. I'm like yeah

1413
01:23:15.54 --> 01:23:19.22
This is ridiculous you're doing it with your eyes close. I'm like hey, you know what chief

1414
01:23:19.46 --> 01:23:21.46
Why don't you just let me carry the machine gun?

1415
01:23:22.18 --> 01:23:26.18
He's like why? Because what the machine gun would be the point man. Let's mix it up

1416
01:23:26.82 --> 01:23:28.82
He's like oh dude cool

1417
01:23:28.82 --> 01:23:30.82
You know the guys like that

1418
01:23:31.62 --> 01:23:38.18
Well, that was another un-of-en-pull year and a half two years gone. What did you make so then what about your seventh-platoon

1419
01:23:39.14 --> 01:23:41.70
Well, I made E6 and my sixth-platoon

1420
01:23:42.34 --> 01:23:46.66
Damn so I was an E6 and my seventh-platoon, but I wasn't the op-pl again

1421
01:23:48.26 --> 01:23:52.82
I was the ordinance rep I went back to ordinance rep point man

1422
01:23:52.82 --> 01:24:01.78
You just keep rolling. Yeah, you just keep rolling. You did keep rolling. Yeah, and now after that one another

1423
01:24:02.74 --> 01:24:07.86
That was our problem though. We actually oh yeah, but yeah, it was like 30 days on the ship

1424
01:24:08.42 --> 01:24:10.42
Like Korea or something terrible

1425
01:24:11.94 --> 01:24:16.82
I remember that because I watched the subway series on the ship back there when the mats were plenty and

1426
01:24:18.58 --> 01:24:20.58
Like right

1427
01:24:20.58 --> 01:24:30.50
I think we ended in 2000 maybe 99 2000 so you're a first class at this point. Yeah, and then you get sent to trade it

1428
01:24:30.50 --> 01:24:39.54
I get sent to training cell it train cell a team fire and after like a couple of months you did your platoon LPO and then you did four more deployments

1429
01:24:42.10 --> 01:24:44.90
Yeah

1430
01:24:44.90 --> 01:24:53.06
Before I was it she and then you then you got sent to training cell. Yep, and then they take training cell and they group it all together and to trade that right

1431
01:24:53.22 --> 01:24:58.98
So I did like a year and trade training cell at five okay, and then when I got orders to trade at

1432
01:24:59.38 --> 01:25:04.42
Those were three years and my way man. I already did a year in training like how we don't get a shit like fuck

1433
01:25:05.78 --> 01:25:07.78
So we stood up trade at and

1434
01:25:10.26 --> 01:25:13.22
I was the LPO of Land Warp there

1435
01:25:13.22 --> 01:25:15.22
They a whole time I was there and

1436
01:25:18.10 --> 01:25:24.10
During that I did get another school though. I went to New Zealand to the tracking course. Oh damn

1437
01:25:24.26 --> 01:25:30.34
So I learned that attract humans over there. It was it was a awesome like not easy course

1438
01:25:31.46 --> 01:25:35.86
Met a lot of really good cats from around the world and had a lot of fun

1439
01:25:35.86 --> 01:25:40.82
When did how long did you been at trade out when September 11 happened? I'm

1440
01:25:46.02 --> 01:25:53.22
I'm not sure maybe six months six months and then what would you just freak out? No, I went to New Zealand

1441
01:25:53.62 --> 01:25:55.62
Everybody else went to Afghanistan. I went to New Zealand

1442
01:25:56.90 --> 01:25:59.70
As I had how long was that course seven weeks

1443
01:25:59.70 --> 01:26:04.98
So you get done with that and now you're freaking out. Well, it costs I am

1444
01:26:05.78 --> 01:26:07.78
So I come back from that and

1445
01:26:08.74 --> 01:26:10.74
All right, one of my going

1446
01:26:11.54 --> 01:26:13.54
Okay, you're gonna go

1447
01:26:14.18 --> 01:26:16.18
You're gonna go and then

1448
01:26:16.74 --> 01:26:23.14
Like I didn't I just kept working at nylon working work and working and now when I rack kicked off

1449
01:26:23.14 --> 01:26:29.30
One of my own mass chiefs like I need a guy so he took me and set me overseas and that's when you were there

1450
01:26:30.26 --> 01:26:31.30
All right

1451
01:26:31.30 --> 01:26:36.98
This is when yeah, you relieved us right so we should we did like a little turnover

1452
01:26:36.98 --> 01:26:41.86
What I was working with poles yeah, but we were working with the poles so

1453
01:26:42.42 --> 01:26:46.26
Right, yeah, so you came into kind of take over the liaison

1454
01:26:46.26 --> 01:26:47.62
Right, that's what it was

1455
01:26:48.66 --> 01:26:50.66
And then

1456
01:26:50.66 --> 01:26:52.66
Which was a good job. Oh, it was great

1457
01:26:53.70 --> 01:26:58.26
You must have been stoked so I was I wasn't bad dad. I wasn't all aside

1458
01:26:58.26 --> 01:27:05.14
I was in Mosul I was back and forth to Bahrain. I really I was like the in the other guy

1459
01:27:06.02 --> 01:27:08.02
If you wanted something done I

1460
01:27:08.34 --> 01:27:11.22
Mean I was walking through these foreign airports with

1461
01:27:11.94 --> 01:27:15.22
Dumpel bags full of machine guns and just

1462
01:27:15.70 --> 01:27:19.30
Going to like the brits or whatever country had a plane

1463
01:27:19.30 --> 01:27:23.86
I mean, they're like we can't do that my hair here here is a bottle of scotch

1464
01:27:23.86 --> 01:27:27.86
I mean that's how you got shit done and then all of a sudden I show up in like Bosra

1465
01:27:28.42 --> 01:27:31.46
And like okay, I got to do this for a while and then I'd be like all right

1466
01:27:31.46 --> 01:27:33.94
I'm gonna go to Mosul get a plate there from

1467
01:27:34.82 --> 01:27:36.82
Priving people with stopping

1468
01:27:37.46 --> 01:27:42.18
No orders and you know you think it's like we get your orders and you wait for your point now

1469
01:27:42.18 --> 01:27:44.90
It was like they just got to fend for yourself and I loved it

1470
01:27:45.38 --> 01:27:47.38
It was awesome

1471
01:27:47.38 --> 01:27:51.94
Then you did that full and I made cheap on that deployment that's when you made cheap

1472
01:27:51.94 --> 01:27:55.54
Yeah, I squeaked under the thing I had like 19 years and oh

1473
01:27:56.02 --> 01:27:58.26
Day or 18 and a half whatever

1474
01:27:58.26 --> 01:28:02.66
And then when when did you find out you were gonna go to team three?

1475
01:28:03.70 --> 01:28:05.70
All right after I made cheap

1476
01:28:06.18 --> 01:28:07.38
Yep

1477
01:28:07.38 --> 01:28:13.06
Because the guy we were talking about called me this office you guys I got you to an at team three. I might you know that

1478
01:28:13.06 --> 01:28:18.66
Perfect where you ever worried you weren't gonna make cheap and you'd get no

1479
01:28:19.06 --> 01:28:22.26
No, you figured it would work out. Yeah, I would always work out

1480
01:28:23.54 --> 01:28:25.54
I would make it work out

1481
01:28:25.54 --> 01:28:31.22
I'd strangle someone before I didn't you know it would just it would just work out bodies would disappear

1482
01:28:31.22 --> 01:28:33.22
Whatever, I don't care

1483
01:28:33.46 --> 01:28:39.06
Now I take this and I'd be like all right here's what's gonna happen. You know your signature is gonna be on there

1484
01:28:39.06 --> 01:28:43.46
You're blood, you know, it's one of the other it's gonna fucking happen and that's it

1485
01:28:44.18 --> 01:28:48.02
Not I've been not been doing this my whole life just like okay

1486
01:28:49.22 --> 01:28:53.86
You're gonna sit over the corner like you know now not gonna do it

1487
01:28:55.30 --> 01:29:01.94
And then so then you showed up a team three I show up a team three and there is task unit bruiser

1488
01:29:02.90 --> 01:29:07.70
We talked about that on the last one, but we got to reiterate that was so funny

1489
01:29:07.70 --> 01:29:11.30
Like who's this will ink guy and I'm like who?

1490
01:29:12.82 --> 01:29:14.82
Oh, Jocco they're like oh

1491
01:29:15.06 --> 01:29:17.78
It says John will link will I'm like

1492
01:29:18.82 --> 01:29:22.02
Now I don't really know I'm kind of know I'm walking away like oh

1493
01:29:23.38 --> 01:29:25.38
Don't worry we're good to go

1494
01:29:25.86 --> 01:29:28.10
We're all set we're all set champ

1495
01:29:28.90 --> 01:29:31.78
Like not but you know the officers like well, what's he like I'm like

1496
01:29:31.78 --> 01:29:36.82
He's good to go that's all you need to know just stand the fuck by

1497
01:29:37.70 --> 01:29:41.62
Don't have any fucking me I don't care I didn't know you my whole life

1498
01:29:42.18 --> 01:29:45.14
My yeah, whatever I go don't have any like loose ends

1499
01:29:46.18 --> 01:29:48.18
And they're just like you know officers

1500
01:29:49.46 --> 01:29:51.46
I'm like what do you mean

1501
01:29:51.86 --> 01:29:55.62
I mean no fucking loose ends because he's gonna you know

1502
01:29:56.18 --> 01:29:59.14
He's like a shock in the water like a smell buddy. He'll go

1503
01:29:59.14 --> 01:30:01.14
Oh

1504
01:30:00.82 --> 01:30:02.82
Really can't show up at a proper uniform

1505
01:30:04.10 --> 01:30:07.22
And they're just like really what is he like a

1506
01:30:07.78 --> 01:30:13.14
Uniform or Nazi or whatever you know and like no he's just like do it right

1507
01:30:15.06 --> 01:30:18.10
I go I go here's here's an idea

1508
01:30:19.06 --> 01:30:23.06
If you do say hey, what do you think about this? Jocco. He'd look at you ago

1509
01:30:23.94 --> 01:30:26.26
Well, I thought about like doing it like good

1510
01:30:26.26 --> 01:30:31.62
Not like what you're saying that's just junk and they're like oh

1511
01:30:32.82 --> 01:30:39.86
Yeah, then you meet everybody yeah, yeah, yeah, that was that was good. That was funny. Yeah, that was a

1512
01:30:41.06 --> 01:30:43.86
Good time you could tell almost immediately

1513
01:30:44.66 --> 01:30:50.10
Like that we were gonna have a good time. Oh, yeah, I know I know everyone was kind of there

1514
01:30:50.10 --> 01:30:52.10
Everyone was kind of in the game and

1515
01:30:52.10 --> 01:30:57.22
Yeah, you could tell pretty quick we're gonna have a good time and the very first thing we did was land warfare

1516
01:30:57.62 --> 01:31:02.50
Which is as it should be there's a little bit of luck involved with training to get to do first

1517
01:31:03.46 --> 01:31:11.46
But you know we got lucky you might find or someone moved the freaking things on the boards over a trade at to make us have land warfare first

1518
01:31:11.86 --> 01:31:13.86
But we had land warfare first

1519
01:31:14.10 --> 01:31:19.30
You know there's a lot of guys teen guys probably listening to podcast away we should shit here

1520
01:31:19.30 --> 01:31:21.30
Yeah

1521
01:31:21.30 --> 01:31:26.90
And I got a thing that they're like yeah, we did this for a strong member if we did that for us

1522
01:31:27.30 --> 01:31:30.26
Like I remember everything like everything

1523
01:31:31.46 --> 01:31:34.74
But not everything you know what I mean yeah, like if you say

1524
01:31:36.34 --> 01:31:38.34
Like

1525
01:31:38.34 --> 01:31:40.98
Like shum that was down there for a wrote a wrote a book

1526
01:31:41.62 --> 01:31:44.34
He's got a memory because I'm like

1527
01:31:44.34 --> 01:31:52.58
How did you remember that? He's like I used to write stuff down now I had a wheelbook just like you did

1528
01:31:52.90 --> 01:31:57.30
And I would write stuff down I go back. I still have them. This they make no sense

1529
01:31:58.66 --> 01:32:06.90
It says I got a grid coordinates then I got to like align through it and it says other fucking grid and then roll over next day

1530
01:32:09.14 --> 01:32:10.34
Get

1531
01:32:10.34 --> 01:32:12.82
Get guns like what yeah

1532
01:32:12.82 --> 01:32:17.86
What would you have to write that down minor like that too? I have from when we were in Ramadi

1533
01:32:17.86 --> 01:32:19.86
I have three like

1534
01:32:20.58 --> 01:32:22.58
I forget what size they are but maybe

1535
01:32:23.94 --> 01:32:29.62
Maybe eight by six or something they fit in your cargo pocket right and I carried it all the time

1536
01:32:30.02 --> 01:32:36.90
And so I've got all these little boxes with words next to them and I can kind of remember what someone one thing that's cool is

1537
01:32:37.14 --> 01:32:41.22
When I would sit through a mission brief I would write my notes down that I was gonna say to everyone

1538
01:32:41.22 --> 01:32:45.70
So I have like mission you know one thirty four and it says

1539
01:32:46.66 --> 01:32:49.70
You know tell them the watch you know it says watch that road

1540
01:32:50.82 --> 01:32:55.94
This building is a threat and don't forget to check in with this ECP

1541
01:32:55.94 --> 01:33:03.46
You know like just like random stuff that was super important and super emphasized the rules of engagement

1542
01:33:03.46 --> 01:33:06.82
Yeah, yeah, of course. I did that. I thought that was great. Yeah

1543
01:33:06.82 --> 01:33:11.54
But so I have these kind of like random notes and what sucks is

1544
01:33:12.82 --> 01:33:20.90
Life had the whole hard drive of every op that we did and it was classified secret obviously and it was classified secret for no good reason

1545
01:33:21.46 --> 01:33:26.02
But you know when we we had to turn it in and they took it in this destroyer whatever

1546
01:33:26.26 --> 01:33:30.10
But that had every op some every op every planning

1547
01:33:30.50 --> 01:33:32.50
I mean everything was on that and

1548
01:33:32.50 --> 01:33:41.38
Yeah, that's good the notebooks I have are like your notebooks. It's like some random grid coordinate some random execution checklist four lines

1549
01:33:41.38 --> 01:33:46.34
And I'm like and I'll rearrange this. Yeah, it's like so many they can't remember

1550
01:33:47.30 --> 01:33:49.30
Like all the shit, you know

1551
01:33:50.50 --> 01:33:54.10
I'd look at the notebooks and usually that none of them were like full

1552
01:33:54.82 --> 01:33:58.50
Some of like three quarters then I lost it in a pair of bag forever

1553
01:33:58.50 --> 01:34:05.14
So I just get another one and be like I'd write this down like and I'm thinking why am I writing this down?

1554
01:34:06.02 --> 01:34:10.02
Like at what point like in the middle of the night when I'm on nods and I'm in a gunfight

1555
01:34:10.02 --> 01:34:13.46
I'm gonna pull this notebook out go. Oh, yeah, he's no

1556
01:34:14.02 --> 01:34:19.06
I'm just gonna beat you up to someplace where there's nobody shoot at me and then I'll like figure it out

1557
01:34:19.86 --> 01:34:21.86
Yeah, yeah

1558
01:34:21.86 --> 01:34:26.58
That's why I would be right I wrote that the notes that I wrote down were all notes that I wrote down

1559
01:34:26.58 --> 01:34:32.42
So that I was gonna tell you guys yeah, yeah, like every every note I have is a note to you guys

1560
01:34:32.42 --> 01:34:36.58
I mean very I guess maybe there's a third of them that are notes to me that say like

1561
01:34:37.22 --> 01:34:40.98
Hey tell the CO blah blah blah or tell the brigade commander that you know

1562
01:34:41.30 --> 01:34:45.54
The guys are gonna be over you like so there's some notes like that but I don't have any notes that say

1563
01:34:46.74 --> 01:34:48.74
I felt

1564
01:34:48.74 --> 01:34:54.50
I felt good about this operation and I you know what I mean I have of course not I never any

1565
01:34:54.50 --> 01:34:59.22
If actually yeah, I don't have any of that I don't like like when I actually did sleep I

1566
01:34:59.94 --> 01:35:07.62
would like all right my gun's good. Okay. I'd lay down and I would sleep like a baby

1567
01:35:08.34 --> 01:35:12.26
For those hours whenever I slept so good in the war zone

1568
01:35:12.90 --> 01:35:16.58
Number one you're like wicked tired number two. It's simple

1569
01:35:17.86 --> 01:35:21.22
It's not like life you get up every day. Okay. Here's what I'm gonna do. Yeah, it's fine

1570
01:35:21.70 --> 01:35:22.90
I'm gonna bed well

1571
01:35:22.90 --> 01:35:25.54
And get up and yeah easy

1572
01:35:26.66 --> 01:35:29.14
No like regular life shit

1573
01:35:29.94 --> 01:35:30.90
Terrible

1574
01:35:30.90 --> 01:35:34.26
Yeah, there's there's definitely the optempo of

1575
01:35:35.06 --> 01:35:39.22
There's just you constantly have the next thing that you're like there's no

1576
01:35:39.94 --> 01:35:41.62
You never finish

1577
01:35:41.62 --> 01:35:46.98
On a deployment you like you don't finish the day the day is rolls into the next day into the next day

1578
01:35:46.98 --> 01:35:53.22
So you're just on this this amped up cycle of what are we gonna do next what's going on yeah and it

1579
01:35:53.78 --> 01:35:58.34
Those doesn't stop so when you when you when you have a chance to lay down you like

1580
01:35:58.90 --> 01:36:04.50
Yeah, yeah, it done there's a picture me and Dave Burke that still be yeah, yeah, nice reaction time

1581
01:36:05.54 --> 01:36:09.22
But it's me and him I'm pretty sure it's cop falcon and

1582
01:36:10.18 --> 01:36:15.78
You know keys the commander of salt six and I'm the commander of tasking a bruiser

1583
01:36:15.78 --> 01:36:17.78
And we're up on this rooftop

1584
01:36:18.42 --> 01:36:22.26
And we're both asleep. It's probably about 10 o'clock in the morning and

1585
01:36:23.46 --> 01:36:27.78
It's funny, but I was thinking like by the time I would get into the field

1586
01:36:28.26 --> 01:36:30.26
I'd be so tired

1587
01:36:30.26 --> 01:36:32.26
done

1588
01:36:32.26 --> 01:36:36.98
And you know and that'd be the first time where like okay cool everyone's on security

1589
01:36:37.30 --> 01:36:43.18
And I'm gonna go to sleep right now and it's Dave Burke and me sit on a rooftop racked out just done

1590
01:36:43.18 --> 01:36:46.38
And just need three hours of sleep

1591
01:36:47.42 --> 01:36:55.98
I remember that one deployment that one I was up on this building and I had three and one mag and I was looking to say and for some reason that little

1592
01:36:56.94 --> 01:36:58.94
Section was just me

1593
01:36:59.58 --> 01:37:05.50
We didn't have enough people for the whole building whatever so that's fine. I could crawl and meet up with the other guys

1594
01:37:05.50 --> 01:37:07.50
Then go downstairs. Don't be too

1595
01:37:08.06 --> 01:37:10.06
It's like August

1596
01:37:10.06 --> 01:37:17.66
And like buck. I don't have any water. I don't have any shade nothing. I have to stand the gun

1597
01:37:18.22 --> 01:37:20.22
So it now I realize this about

1598
01:37:22.14 --> 01:37:27.18
The nine in the morning so the sun goes down at like nine at night

1599
01:37:28.78 --> 01:37:31.34
I go okay. Yeah, I'm breaking my shit down

1600
01:37:33.50 --> 01:37:36.70
Kind of so this is after you've been sitting there for 14 hours. Yeah

1601
01:37:36.70 --> 01:37:41.98
And you have a crawl back you have zero fucking water your system. Like nothing

1602
01:37:42.38 --> 01:37:44.38
It's like a hundred and twenty degrees

1603
01:37:45.74 --> 01:37:48.38
So I'm like I break out my silver ranger

1604
01:37:49.50 --> 01:37:51.10
Like as I know what's going on

1605
01:37:52.46 --> 01:37:58.30
My lips are as white as this piece of paper like just like that chunks some like

1606
01:38:00.30 --> 01:38:02.30
I'm feeling off and like I

1607
01:38:02.30 --> 01:38:06.22
You know I'll be fine, but I

1608
01:38:07.50 --> 01:38:10.06
Literally got like three hours to like die

1609
01:38:11.26 --> 01:38:13.26
And I

1610
01:38:17.02 --> 01:38:21.50
So I'll say a fucking thing because I want to be a pussy, you know

1611
01:38:22.46 --> 01:38:26.38
But I know I got some coax or something and come to you

1612
01:38:26.38 --> 01:38:28.38
You know

1613
01:38:28.38 --> 01:38:30.38
I finally like get that like

1614
01:38:32.62 --> 01:38:37.02
Because my throat's like this big you know there's like nothing there's no airway

1615
01:38:37.82 --> 01:38:41.58
So I put my rocker. I'm where I'm actually when I was building at night, you know, and say

1616
01:38:43.18 --> 01:38:47.42
You know I'm like looking down and holding my field of fire, you know and I'm the chief

1617
01:38:47.42 --> 01:38:51.02
So I should be smarter than that but I'm like

1618
01:38:51.82 --> 01:38:55.58
My vision starts to narrow because I like and I'm like

1619
01:38:55.58 --> 01:38:58.94
I can snap out of it and I'm like that I'm good and go

1620
01:38:59.98 --> 01:39:04.14
I get back and after like an hour back at the camera. I'll shoot I got to drink some water

1621
01:39:04.86 --> 01:39:07.26
You know and I'll drag like four courts a while

1622
01:39:09.26 --> 01:39:12.30
And like six hours later I was pissing like blue

1623
01:39:13.42 --> 01:39:14.78
You know still

1624
01:39:14.78 --> 01:39:20.38
I don't think you can really come back from a dehydration like that, but it's all those years

1625
01:39:20.38 --> 01:39:27.58
Like drinking and let just conditions you so when it's you know nylon so when you get into that spot

1626
01:39:27.58 --> 01:39:30.38
It's not so bad like I'm not gonna die

1627
01:39:31.10 --> 01:39:33.10
I'm wicked close

1628
01:39:33.34 --> 01:39:36.62
No, seriously like you start you know feeling your

1629
01:39:37.42 --> 01:39:39.10
Justiness and then you just go

1630
01:39:39.10 --> 01:39:45.10
And it goes away for a while and it comes back because you can't out you cannot run your body

1631
01:39:45.10 --> 01:39:46.30
You're like you know what I mean?

1632
01:39:46.30 --> 01:39:48.70
Yeah, the dehydration will get you yeah

1633
01:39:48.70 --> 01:39:50.70
It's it's crazy how the

1634
01:39:51.90 --> 01:39:54.86
Man you'd see guys that you'd see guys at the desert

1635
01:39:55.74 --> 01:39:58.94
Training they'd go they'd go to it's up

1636
01:39:59.66 --> 01:40:04.70
Pretty much if we were doing when I was a trade-out if it was summer and we were doing like a

1637
01:40:06.22 --> 01:40:07.18
eight

1638
01:40:07.18 --> 01:40:09.66
six to eight click insert

1639
01:40:10.46 --> 01:40:12.62
By the time extraact was going down

1640
01:40:12.94 --> 01:40:17.74
There's a decent chance someone was going down by the real yeah and and you're talking about

1641
01:40:17.74 --> 01:40:25.82
Completely sober usually hydrated usually all the answer why is it that it was usually on the insert because you just coming out of the damn air conditioning

1642
01:40:27.10 --> 01:40:32.30
Because that's it now that I think about it was almost always on the insert well one of the things I instituted and

1643
01:40:32.30 --> 01:40:37.10
And if I'm wrong about this somebody correct me, but I think I was the first guy to do it

1644
01:40:37.98 --> 01:40:40.54
Was what we do in me action drills

1645
01:40:40.54 --> 01:40:45.82
I would walk the guys out I did a fucking thousands of those and

1646
01:40:48.54 --> 01:40:50.54
I would preplan a guy

1647
01:40:52.54 --> 01:40:56.54
And you kind of could tell like we're not gonna shoot back towards the canal kind of shit

1648
01:40:57.66 --> 01:41:02.14
But a guy who's on that right flank if it was perpendicular parallel whatever was

1649
01:41:03.10 --> 01:41:05.98
The point man they would just fall down

1650
01:41:05.98 --> 01:41:10.30
With nothing just fall down and like weigh there

1651
01:41:11.02 --> 01:41:16.86
Guys would be like contact right you know or they start shooting and they drag the weird guy and like

1652
01:41:18.38 --> 01:41:22.46
Okay, and then come back and usually they did a good job, you know

1653
01:41:23.26 --> 01:41:28.14
Like so what happened and well, you know we took contact this guy went down blah blah

1654
01:41:30.62 --> 01:41:32.62
No, you didn't

1655
01:41:32.62 --> 01:41:34.62
God just fell down

1656
01:41:34.62 --> 01:41:40.22
Well, what do you mean? I'm like well, maybe it was a heat casually and not to be a day

1657
01:41:40.54 --> 01:41:41.90
Kind of to be a day

1658
01:41:41.90 --> 01:41:43.58
Yeah, that's how you teach the lesson

1659
01:41:43.58 --> 01:41:44.94
But it's like

1660
01:41:45.10 --> 01:41:46.06
You know

1661
01:41:46.06 --> 01:41:50.30
So how do you differentiate maybe you get taken out by someone you don't hear the shot

1662
01:41:51.66 --> 01:41:55.74
Well, what are you shooting at you know it there's no real good answer

1663
01:41:56.30 --> 01:42:02.46
It's trying to take the blinders off. Yeah, I was gonna say that's one of those things what you're actually teaching is like you actually have to think about what's happening

1664
01:42:02.46 --> 01:42:09.42
Oh, absolutely even in an immediate action drill like okay, there's an immediate action drill, but you better be you better think about what's actually going on

1665
01:42:09.98 --> 01:42:11.98
Because the answers aren't

1666
01:42:12.78 --> 01:42:14.78
What's the word?

1667
01:42:14.78 --> 01:42:18.78
The answers aren't just a wrote memory. No, there's no answer. It's all

1668
01:42:19.50 --> 01:42:21.82
garbage you gotta decipher and figure out

1669
01:42:23.18 --> 01:42:26.78
You know the only thing that comes close to it and there's stability and we're all this hunting

1670
01:42:26.78 --> 01:42:32.94
Yeah, I'll count this last pass here. I killed this gigantic bull. Well me and

1671
01:42:35.98 --> 01:42:37.66
Two team guys

1672
01:42:37.66 --> 01:42:38.94
We're

1673
01:42:38.94 --> 01:42:44.06
There was five team guys there in Wyoming and when I when I killed my big bull

1674
01:42:44.06 --> 01:42:46.22
It was like the other two guys

1675
01:42:47.74 --> 01:42:50.86
Couldn't carry gun because they already limited out they tagged out

1676
01:42:50.86 --> 01:42:56.14
So we ran it just like an op and we have you know little PLL

1677
01:42:57.34 --> 01:43:00.78
Take off hand arm signal comes up and guys are

1678
01:43:02.30 --> 01:43:08.30
My chum crashes like okay, this big bull elk's going from here to here and it was so intense and

1679
01:43:09.02 --> 01:43:11.02
I tell this to my chums like

1680
01:43:11.98 --> 01:43:18.78
I mean I actually shot some guy in the war whatever you know like yawning like

1681
01:43:18.78 --> 01:43:20.78
Yeah, like

1682
01:43:22.14 --> 01:43:24.14
Hunting elk I'm like this

1683
01:43:24.86 --> 01:43:31.58
It's they're so like big and majestic and beautiful and like they'll kill you in a minute

1684
01:43:32.46 --> 01:43:38.62
And they don't care about you they're just like it's like life on steroids. It's so unbelievable

1685
01:43:39.34 --> 01:43:43.34
I highly recommend that if you like hunting you hunt elk because

1686
01:43:43.34 --> 01:43:51.66
It's they're screaming you know and then the rut and they're battling each other you can hear the times and then the big bull comes out

1687
01:43:52.22 --> 01:43:57.18
Bucking incredible. I'm going in September. It's unbelievable with a bow

1688
01:43:57.98 --> 01:44:02.70
It's I'm never I'm not a bow hunter yeah, but I don't know where you go on you go and hide

1689
01:44:02.70 --> 01:44:09.82
How going to Utah Utah yeah, yeah to a to a place that guy went to high school bow Hanson Utah

1690
01:44:09.82 --> 01:44:11.82
He's from this this this

1691
01:44:11.82 --> 01:44:15.74
The hunt that I'm going on I'm going with it's because that's like a

1692
01:44:16.54 --> 01:44:19.98
It's like the the best possible hunt like Andy Andy stump

1693
01:44:20.78 --> 01:44:22.78
He said that this

1694
01:44:22.78 --> 01:44:26.54
He's like yeah, he's like this hunt is gonna spoil you because the best possible

1695
01:44:26.54 --> 01:44:32.62
I love that and even he's the guy that's taking me John Dudley who's a world famous bow hunter and archer and he's like

1696
01:44:33.18 --> 01:44:37.74
Yeah, it this is good as it gets like this the spot where I'm going as good as it gets so

1697
01:44:38.38 --> 01:44:40.78
Should it's freaking awesome. It's it's so

1698
01:44:40.78 --> 01:44:42.78
Bad ass

1699
01:44:42.78 --> 01:44:48.62
You know, I went I went home back to New Hampshire because it was that was a October season back to New Hampshire hunted

1700
01:44:49.58 --> 01:44:55.02
I hunt with these guys up at a camp. They're just like the best everybody's like a character

1701
01:44:55.58 --> 01:45:00.06
Kill a lot deal dear the shoe, you know, but it's not like that

1702
01:45:00.62 --> 01:45:09.66
It's you know one thing well, so this guy John Dudley was asking me he's like it seems like this would be good for guys to get into

1703
01:45:09.66 --> 01:45:11.66
Oh my god

1704
01:45:11.66 --> 01:45:18.30
I'm like yeah, and for me so we just did this 3D archery challenge up in Montana and

1705
01:45:18.94 --> 01:45:25.10
When we're up there look it's an it's an admin thing basically like you're walking through the woods and then they go

1706
01:45:25.10 --> 01:45:29.02
Okay, there's the target and then you you shoot the target there anywhere between

1707
01:45:29.66 --> 01:45:30.86
30 and

1708
01:45:30.86 --> 01:45:34.86
Maybe 120 yards with a bow which is far shots but

1709
01:45:34.86 --> 01:45:40.22
For me I was telling him I'm like you know when I was younger in the teams

1710
01:45:40.94 --> 01:45:46.86
We would patrol around the woods yeah, and that's what you're doing you're patroling on the wood

1711
01:45:46.86 --> 01:45:52.70
You're trying to be quiet and like that's a skill that and the wind yeah the wind and but like even in the desert

1712
01:45:53.34 --> 01:45:55.34
It's different than

1713
01:45:55.34 --> 01:45:59.74
Like when I was when I when we would go to Fort Lewis Washington, or we'd go to

1714
01:46:00.30 --> 01:46:04.06
Fort Chaffey Arkansas or like we'd go down to Panorge you ever go to one of the

1715
01:46:04.06 --> 01:46:06.06
Training trips to Panama so

1716
01:46:06.86 --> 01:46:11.34
Like patrolling through the woods patrolling through the water not Panama city Panama. Oh, yeah

1717
01:46:11.34 --> 01:46:14.38
Yeah jungle. Oh, so you get that that

1718
01:46:15.10 --> 01:46:21.10
That skill of walking quietly through the woods and looking at someone else and

1719
01:46:21.58 --> 01:46:26.62
Doing all hand signals and not and I was saying this to John I'm like and you're not talking no

1720
01:46:27.18 --> 01:46:32.30
Where would we which I know I have a pond cast which is what I do is like talk a bunch

1721
01:46:32.30 --> 01:46:38.86
But I actually actually don't love to talk to all people all the time. No really really

1722
01:46:41.18 --> 01:46:46.30
So that's someone some like J.O. with junior house who we'd walk I'm like hey what's up?

1723
01:46:46.30 --> 01:46:49.82
Hey, hey, well he chuckle what do you think about this you just be like

1724
01:46:51.26 --> 01:46:53.26
Just like turn and walk away

1725
01:46:54.86 --> 01:46:57.82
Then they got me like looking at me like we want to meet for

1726
01:46:57.82 --> 01:47:03.10
Oh, he just doesn't want to talk to you. So what don't get all but hurt over it

1727
01:47:04.06 --> 01:47:06.06
He's got like stuff on his mind like

1728
01:47:07.02 --> 01:47:09.02
I'm hungry

1729
01:47:10.94 --> 01:47:16.06
Yeah, so that's kind of cool. I'm looking forward to going out mad honnain in in September

1730
01:47:16.46 --> 01:47:20.46
And I'll report back with how it goes absolutely man there's a

1731
01:47:21.66 --> 01:47:24.62
No pressure shooting a freaking bow and arrow

1732
01:47:25.42 --> 01:47:27.42
at

1733
01:47:27.42 --> 01:47:31.74
Yeah, it's no joke. There's no real will be will be will be

1734
01:47:32.70 --> 01:47:37.66
30 or 40 yards away yeah, like outside of that like I I can

1735
01:47:39.50 --> 01:47:46.78
Loosely hit a target you know well you've been practicing like you can practice I practice but you don't want to you don't want to have a bad shot

1736
01:47:46.78 --> 01:47:48.78
No, but how are you?

1737
01:47:48.78 --> 01:47:50.78
Everything good like

1738
01:47:50.78 --> 01:47:55.10
Shooting your bow like 50 yards all hit all the time like you're good to go all hit yeah

1739
01:47:55.10 --> 01:48:00.46
Like to see oh your bad example like how can I stand next to you like a fucking tambourine?

1740
01:48:00.86 --> 01:48:05.34
Make you like shake because nothing you'll be like laughing and you like that man

1741
01:48:06.14 --> 01:48:13.18
When they're fucking screaming it's it's the coolest thing in the fucking world. I swear to God

1742
01:48:13.58 --> 01:48:17.34
That's awesome. Well, well, I don't know if you want to get it if you want to get a bow and start

1743
01:48:17.98 --> 01:48:19.26
hunting

1744
01:48:19.26 --> 01:48:20.78
I'm sure one thing at a time

1745
01:48:20.78 --> 01:48:27.74
I don't even know I'm doing after this podcast, but I go in across the street to Buffalo Wild Wings get all gonged up

1746
01:48:32.54 --> 01:48:38.70
So bruiser I mean you know like I said there's a million things to talk about to your bruiser

1747
01:48:39.50 --> 01:48:42.54
But when you got done with to you bruiser

1748
01:48:44.06 --> 01:48:50.38
What were your what were you're like looking back on it not looking back on it now because now you just look back

1749
01:48:50.38 --> 01:48:53.50
Everyone like all that was off but when you were like when we got back

1750
01:48:55.42 --> 01:49:00.54
Two weeks later what were you what were you when you look back at it from that closer perspective I

1751
01:49:01.74 --> 01:49:03.74
Was kind of lost like

1752
01:49:04.94 --> 01:49:07.26
It's not gonna get any better than that you know

1753
01:49:08.14 --> 01:49:11.34
All right, I was in the next trip. I was the

1754
01:49:13.42 --> 01:49:18.86
Offs Chief then I got fired. I think it fired I get fired because I made senior chief

1755
01:49:18.86 --> 01:49:22.78
And I was like well cool all right

1756
01:49:24.06 --> 01:49:28.30
And then I had to go to the senior and list the academy and I was like whatever and

1757
01:49:30.38 --> 01:49:34.86
You know, I went to team seven and I pretty much got fired

1758
01:49:36.06 --> 01:49:40.06
Which was fine. I didn't want to do that anyway and I was in ranges and

1759
01:49:41.90 --> 01:49:45.58
They're like we need a guy to go do the

1760
01:49:45.58 --> 01:49:48.78
Provincial reconstruction team

1761
01:49:50.22 --> 01:49:52.22
Come like okay

1762
01:49:52.22 --> 01:49:55.02
So I didn't have genocide and I've got a state so I went to Afghanistan

1763
01:49:55.74 --> 01:50:05.18
Why did this work up for like two months at camp A and then Indiana so this is a this is a mission where you'd be going with not with like a seal

1764
01:50:05.18 --> 01:50:07.18
Poutoon but you're going with

1765
01:50:08.22 --> 01:50:11.42
Some other kind of ad hoc group of people

1766
01:50:11.42 --> 01:50:19.98
Oh no, no, it was it was I had a seal Lieutenant commander as a seal okay and I was a seal senior chief and we're the only seals

1767
01:50:21.26 --> 01:50:24.30
And I had about a hundred people

1768
01:50:25.50 --> 01:50:31.74
From the navy the army the national guard so it was and therefore so it was at Hock

1769
01:50:32.94 --> 01:50:36.70
And it was it was like leadership challenge

1770
01:50:36.70 --> 01:50:41.98
I'm not used to working like with the regular but I am used to work with the regular Tricas every frog man has to

1771
01:50:42.54 --> 01:50:44.54
So really wasn't that bad

1772
01:50:45.10 --> 01:50:46.54
But I

1773
01:50:46.54 --> 01:50:49.18
Like very very minimal combat experience

1774
01:50:50.70 --> 01:50:56.78
I had a couple of guys like these old crusty guys who are in the South Carolina national guard

1775
01:50:57.50 --> 01:51:00.30
Some guys were in the Rangers they were awesome man

1776
01:51:00.94 --> 01:51:04.78
But they're all like cops lot of sheriff's or

1777
01:51:04.78 --> 01:51:07.82
Do they must have loved you oh yeah or

1778
01:51:08.62 --> 01:51:10.62
We're prison guards

1779
01:51:10.62 --> 01:51:13.02
You know in a national guard cats

1780
01:51:13.26 --> 01:51:16.70
They were frigging awesome you know once we got through the language barrier

1781
01:51:17.02 --> 01:51:19.66
Because I'm from New England you know they're all from South Carolina

1782
01:51:20.30 --> 01:51:23.66
They were bad ass man they were like a platoon

1783
01:51:24.14 --> 01:51:26.14
Those are just mine my platoon

1784
01:51:26.78 --> 01:51:31.98
You know and they were frigging great they two up to a guy every one of them was awesome

1785
01:51:31.98 --> 01:51:39.58
I had some reserve C-B's who took care of the trucks. You know I guys with no combat extra never even

1786
01:51:40.62 --> 01:51:42.62
Driving these trucks

1787
01:51:42.62 --> 01:51:46.78
You know mortars coming in they performing knifters and it was it was cool

1788
01:51:47.42 --> 01:51:51.02
But I did a lot of vehicle work with them you know

1789
01:51:51.18 --> 01:51:53.18
Media action drills

1790
01:51:53.18 --> 01:51:58.30
How to deal with down people you know we got some we actually got some pretty good training

1791
01:51:58.30 --> 01:52:03.26
You know I learned a few things I'm not afraid to admit when I learned something from you know

1792
01:52:04.54 --> 01:52:09.58
But we're there like a here you know and I broke off for like month month and a

1793
01:52:10.22 --> 01:52:14.62
Just what back to my seal buddies and got after it got a bunch of gunfights and

1794
01:52:15.50 --> 01:52:22.14
You know we get mortar all the time I'd be in a sandwich and rock Chinese one of seven's come in like whatever

1795
01:52:23.26 --> 01:52:25.26
But it was cool

1796
01:52:25.26 --> 01:52:28.70
What was what were you guys actually doing we'd go into

1797
01:52:30.94 --> 01:52:32.94
areas and

1798
01:52:32.78 --> 01:52:34.78
like

1799
01:52:35.02 --> 01:52:40.30
We wouldn't build schools we wouldn't build bridges but we facilitate it

1800
01:52:41.10 --> 01:52:43.10
Going there and me with the village elders

1801
01:52:43.98 --> 01:52:45.66
Now say we need this okay

1802
01:52:47.10 --> 01:52:50.94
So it's set up up proposal and we'd go back given money

1803
01:52:50.94 --> 01:52:56.54
You know or put it out to bid and of course that's all garbage

1804
01:52:57.66 --> 01:53:04.46
It's just a big like shake down all the local politicians just just just come in and take the money and they're like okay

1805
01:53:04.46 --> 01:53:07.90
We'll get you okay, let's see we give him $50,000 to build a bridge

1806
01:53:08.94 --> 01:53:14.94
All right, so the guy wins the bid his company gets the 50 grand the politician comes in and takes like 30

1807
01:53:15.90 --> 01:53:17.90
And then they build the bridge for the $3,000

1808
01:53:17.90 --> 01:53:21.34
No, they come back and ago. We don't have enough to finish. We give them the rest of money

1809
01:53:21.90 --> 01:53:23.90
I mean it's like

1810
01:53:23.74 --> 01:53:25.02
20% of the

1811
01:53:25.02 --> 01:53:27.02
40% I don't know what it is

1812
01:53:27.42 --> 01:53:31.58
Percentages all shake down money they were given to Afghanistan. It's like crazy

1813
01:53:32.22 --> 01:53:37.50
But you know people think in this country that every other country is like us. Yeah, no

1814
01:53:38.22 --> 01:53:41.74
Well, I remember that I don't know if you remember we got to remind you one of the things that

1815
01:53:42.86 --> 01:53:45.74
The guys were concerned about was they were like hey the

1816
01:53:45.74 --> 01:53:50.22
The officers in the Iraqi army are taking the unless they're they're skimming

1817
01:53:50.22 --> 01:53:53.82
So many years up and then it was like you talk to the Iraqi

1818
01:53:53.82 --> 01:53:55.18
There's a yeah, well, he's the boss

1819
01:53:55.42 --> 01:54:02.62
Of course he's gonna take us some of my money. Yeah, yeah, let's take the scam that's the way it goes you know and we were all thinking

1820
01:54:03.50 --> 01:54:05.50
Like like in America

1821
01:54:06.38 --> 01:54:11.90
If you heard that hey the officer is skimming money off the elicited guys is paychecks

1822
01:54:11.90 --> 01:54:17.42
It'd be like oh I need to be crucified right over there like well, yeah, they were like well, yeah, of course

1823
01:54:17.42 --> 01:54:21.98
He's taking a little that's his he's the boss. Yeah, it's not like people who go like this

1824
01:54:22.22 --> 01:54:26.38
They see it on the like six o'clock news with you know

1825
01:54:27.02 --> 01:54:33.18
Whatever shit, you know, she's up there going well today the scandal was there don't don't there's none of that

1826
01:54:33.18 --> 01:54:39.18
It's just whatever is just it's all wild west just do whatever you got big guns you get all the money

1827
01:54:39.18 --> 01:54:41.18
You know

1828
01:54:41.18 --> 01:54:48.78
Then you spent that that year how many like different villages did you guys go trying God like all kinds of them? Yeah

1829
01:54:48.78 --> 01:54:52.94
How would you get in there would you guys doing patrols in there vehicle patrols you find in?

1830
01:54:54.54 --> 01:54:56.22
We rarely

1831
01:54:56.22 --> 01:55:03.50
Used air assets we had always had air support don't at least stand by but most of the time we drew vehicles I had

1832
01:55:03.50 --> 01:55:11.34
Some of it between a dozen and up to like 20 vehicles and I was usually the vehicle commander

1833
01:55:12.06 --> 01:55:15.90
I wasn't overall and yeah, the operation yeah sometimes that was

1834
01:55:17.02 --> 01:55:19.34
But I took these people who never

1835
01:55:20.30 --> 01:55:23.10
Really been in a military vehicle that much and

1836
01:55:24.06 --> 01:55:29.18
We were okay survived few ambushes got blown up a few times had records with us

1837
01:55:29.74 --> 01:55:31.34
Refueling tankers

1838
01:55:31.34 --> 01:55:37.74
I mean it was crazy these were some long transit said oh yeah 100 miles some of them one way

1839
01:55:38.78 --> 01:55:41.42
The IED threat was was it was gigantic

1840
01:55:42.30 --> 01:55:47.02
It was gigantic like say we got blown up a couple times but you could tell was amateur hour

1841
01:55:47.74 --> 01:55:50.14
So back then like said back then

1842
01:55:51.58 --> 01:55:55.02
We had three big threats one was your trip wires

1843
01:55:56.62 --> 01:55:58.62
Or we were manual

1844
01:55:58.62 --> 01:56:00.62
You know and then you had

1845
01:56:06.86 --> 01:56:11.58
Pressure plates pressure plate it's activated yeah, so your pressure plates

1846
01:56:12.06 --> 01:56:16.94
So the way we count it we we counted pressure plates is you got the mine rollers

1847
01:56:17.66 --> 01:56:19.66
And they're like an 8,000 pound thing

1848
01:56:19.66 --> 01:56:27.74
They put in front of either a mat v or a whatever the other one is I had in my own bat v it was awesome

1849
01:56:28.78 --> 01:56:32.14
But so that you roll that in front and of course I had a driver

1850
01:56:33.26 --> 01:56:39.10
You know, but you can't just drive with that you have to counterbalance the it's weird you have to learn how to drive it

1851
01:56:39.58 --> 01:56:44.70
So that's like driving a trailer to reverse right you'd have to put eight that eight thousand pounds of pressure

1852
01:56:44.70 --> 01:56:51.90
Whatever it was maybe I'm wrong and it would detonate and if it does detonate it's not it's so fuck you up

1853
01:56:51.98 --> 01:56:55.50
But it's not gonna flip because you know explosion works goes like this

1854
01:56:56.22 --> 01:56:58.46
So we had that for the pressure plates for the

1855
01:56:59.02 --> 01:57:01.50
So you had some counter measures for the IEDs yeah

1856
01:57:03.18 --> 01:57:06.62
And you ended up hitting just a couple yeah, just couple yeah

1857
01:57:07.34 --> 01:57:09.98
But around us guys had a lot yeah

1858
01:57:09.98 --> 01:57:14.78
We had to respond and we got pretty good at like going out not really being a

1859
01:57:17.26 --> 01:57:25.10
QRF but going out and providing support and I would fan out and I'd walk up and talk to those in charge

1860
01:57:25.10 --> 01:57:27.90
Yeah, what can we do you know but

1861
01:57:29.42 --> 01:57:33.34
I've got a steam was kind of cool because I really love the terrain

1862
01:57:34.14 --> 01:57:36.14
Big mountains like

1863
01:57:36.14 --> 01:57:42.78
thousand you know eight that nine thousand feet up you know it was pretty cool. It was actually beautiful over there

1864
01:57:42.78 --> 01:57:45.42
Yeah, could have ski frigging

1865
01:57:46.22 --> 01:57:51.02
lodges and you know it's that's Northeastern

1866
01:57:51.02 --> 01:57:53.02
Afghanistan. I West it's like desert but

1867
01:57:54.06 --> 01:58:01.42
It was cool and then I came back from that and I put my papers in a retired and I was just like went back to Nio one

1868
01:58:01.98 --> 01:58:03.98
run the boys

1869
01:58:03.98 --> 01:58:05.98
But I basically had a great crew

1870
01:58:07.90 --> 01:58:11.74
Maybe pipe hit and guys they just knew what to do

1871
01:58:12.70 --> 01:58:16.22
So I kind of like get up in the morning and have my coffee

1872
01:58:17.74 --> 01:58:20.94
They hit the gym for a bit maybe go for a run and then

1873
01:58:21.58 --> 01:58:25.50
Jumping my side by side with my 12 gauge and go shoot rattlesnakes

1874
01:58:26.30 --> 01:58:31.82
An eight launch and then do that some more go up to the range look around and everything good yep

1875
01:58:31.82 --> 01:58:37.18
But come back to the camp like watch hockey and drink beer on night. I'm pretty good

1876
01:58:38.14 --> 01:58:39.98
That was like I got to get out I got every tire

1877
01:58:40.54 --> 01:58:43.58
That one that's pretty much it you know

1878
01:58:45.26 --> 01:58:47.26
Terrible get out and it's just

1879
01:58:49.34 --> 01:58:55.98
I mean I did some contract work for wall that dried up and went back to land you know landscaping and

1880
01:58:55.98 --> 01:59:02.14
Construction type work and that sucks, but it was cool

1881
01:59:03.58 --> 01:59:06.78
What are you gonna now you're retired now is that right? Oh?

1882
01:59:08.06 --> 01:59:10.30
Yeah, I mean like retired like

1883
01:59:11.34 --> 01:59:13.34
Yeah

1884
01:59:13.34 --> 01:59:19.90
You're not going to work every day, right? No no. I guess that's what I mean by retired not not this summer not yet so

1885
01:59:19.90 --> 01:59:24.78
I'm just kind of like BTF around

1886
01:59:26.38 --> 01:59:28.78
Yeah, it's actually got a cool

1887
01:59:31.34 --> 01:59:36.86
Hey, I got some questions for you. Yes, uh and this is the great first question

1888
01:59:38.94 --> 01:59:41.34
Very serious in retrospect

1889
01:59:41.34 --> 01:59:49.98
What's the dumbest reason you've ever gotten into a bar fight yeah?

1890
01:59:53.74 --> 01:59:58.94
Probably be easier to figure out the smartest reason you ever gotten to a bar fight. Well I'd have to say

1891
02:00:01.10 --> 02:00:04.30
Farie's rock one night like watching Monday no football

1892
02:00:04.30 --> 02:00:10.54
And the Patriots were losing or something and someone said

1893
02:00:11.58 --> 02:00:14.14
Oh, you know what that's that's cool because you know

1894
02:00:15.34 --> 02:00:20.94
I don't have them in my fantasy flick the only and I just went fucking whack and I fucking smack the guy

1895
02:00:20.94 --> 02:00:28.14
I don't know like it's just terrible like I just I was past and drunken. I don't you know that was pretty dumb

1896
02:00:28.14 --> 02:00:39.50
But there you go sounds like a good one in 20 plus years in the teams what situation challenged your leadership the most and how did you work through it?

1897
02:00:42.62 --> 02:00:44.62
Um

1898
02:00:45.50 --> 02:00:47.50
I'd probably have to say when

1899
02:00:49.82 --> 02:00:55.74
When Mark Lee got killed I'd have to honestly yeah, of course and now

1900
02:00:55.74 --> 02:01:01.10
I mean that's kind of a weird question and I'll get to that but

1901
02:01:03.82 --> 02:01:08.70
I I had to like shove that fucking shit deep down and

1902
02:01:09.74 --> 02:01:11.42
Not like

1903
02:01:11.42 --> 02:01:17.02
Show it and make sure that it was there for the rest of the guys because the milks on the floor

1904
02:01:18.06 --> 02:01:21.82
Obviously you gotta find out why it happened. Wow, so we don't do it again. What the fuck you know

1905
02:01:21.82 --> 02:01:26.70
Sometimes there is no answer but I had to push that shit way down and

1906
02:01:27.02 --> 02:01:30.62
Focus on the tasks that I am whatever they were the day. I couldn't just go a

1907
02:01:31.02 --> 02:01:35.74
Jocco and like I'm a back-as-shit. I'll see it in two days. I can't do that

1908
02:01:36.38 --> 02:01:41.82
So I mean I and I push it down before but that I had to really really really push it down

1909
02:01:42.38 --> 02:01:43.58
So

1910
02:01:43.58 --> 02:01:45.58
That was that was challenging

1911
02:01:45.58 --> 02:01:52.70
I mean other times like leadership. I had guys that get DUIs we intercepted the mail hide it from the cops

1912
02:01:53.10 --> 02:01:55.10
So they never got DUI

1913
02:01:55.10 --> 02:01:58.94
Just take care of it on your own on town and I can say that because both the guys did it for dead

1914
02:02:00.14 --> 02:02:04.62
So I mean I had no problem like fucking cutting through red tape

1915
02:02:06.54 --> 02:02:08.54
But uh that that was probably the worst

1916
02:02:08.54 --> 02:02:16.94
What was your favorite qualification school that you attended while in the teams?

1917
02:02:18.78 --> 02:02:25.26
Oh, that's uh that's easy. It's across to a sniper school in the tracking course. Yeah, that was fucking great

1918
02:02:25.26 --> 02:02:27.26
Yeah, yeah, really good

1919
02:02:27.26 --> 02:02:30.22
That must have been we're here in that when you're hunting

1920
02:02:30.86 --> 02:02:37.02
Yeah, man you must have just been like oh yeah, we'd be overjoyed. Oh my god. Yeah, but like tracking elk

1921
02:02:37.02 --> 02:02:39.02
If you've never done it

1922
02:02:40.86 --> 02:02:45.82
It's you don't have to go to it. Oh you look over especially if there's a little snow

1923
02:02:46.54 --> 02:02:51.74
There's like eight billion tracks because they're in a herd so it's not like you're like oh look at me

1924
02:02:51.74 --> 02:02:57.02
I can see if like 600 yards away like yeah, but there's no snow there because it was just

1925
02:02:58.30 --> 02:03:00.94
You when you listen to these podcasts when I had this guy

1926
02:03:00.94 --> 02:03:06.46
Till John strike a mile and his buddy Doug the Frenchman let turn it on

1927
02:03:07.58 --> 02:03:13.74
They'd be out in Lousy, Cambodia and there was trackers. There was NVA trackers with doughists

1928
02:03:14.30 --> 02:03:23.10
That would be common after them. They carried as part of their standard loadout. They carry pepper like dust and and

1929
02:03:24.38 --> 02:03:26.38
Some other

1930
02:03:26.38 --> 02:03:33.50
The damn coughing method. What is the coughing? Tier gas tier gas powder. They had that

1931
02:03:33.50 --> 02:03:38.62
So they they put that on their trail and they'd hear the dogs like the dogs become in so then they range

1932
02:03:38.62 --> 02:03:43.26
And then all of a sudden they'd start freaking out and then they bring up another dog skip that area

1933
02:03:44.30 --> 02:03:50.46
And I said I said to tilt I was like do you do you I said you must hate dogs? He was I hate him

1934
02:03:51.26 --> 02:03:53.26
Oh, yeah

1935
02:03:53.26 --> 02:03:56.54
We we would we train and out of the feed him and it's like

1936
02:03:57.82 --> 02:03:59.82
One way

1937
02:03:59.82 --> 02:04:01.82
There's several methods, but

1938
02:04:01.82 --> 02:04:03.10
I mean

1939
02:04:03.10 --> 02:04:05.82
I'm not gonna say it on here like how to defeat him

1940
02:04:06.22 --> 02:04:09.66
But it's so simple and it's got like nothing to do with the dog

1941
02:04:10.86 --> 02:04:12.86
It's like crazy

1942
02:04:13.02 --> 02:04:17.02
It's it works too. I as we did exercises, you know and like

1943
02:04:17.02 --> 02:04:22.86
I mean so I'm asking the cat like hey mate, you know

1944
02:04:24.06 --> 02:04:29.74
These dogs like they're good at like exercises like oh no, mate. They're real dogs. They're gonna bite yeah

1945
02:04:30.54 --> 02:04:31.74
Fuck

1946
02:04:31.74 --> 02:04:37.18
This is gonna suck I better fucking be good at it enough. You know going over my notes. Okay. What the you know

1947
02:04:37.74 --> 02:04:39.50
I mean yeah, they were like

1948
02:04:39.66 --> 02:04:41.82
Police dog who like yeah, yeah, we're gonna get you

1949
02:04:41.82 --> 02:04:45.90
I mean, thank God. I mean, I did it right, but like holy shit

1950
02:04:46.86 --> 02:04:54.78
That's one thing. It was a real world off. Like yeah, you know I got an M16 blanks. Yeah, you know because it's really not in the New Zealand that can hurt you

1951
02:04:55.74 --> 02:04:58.14
Like there's no poisonous snakes. There's no

1952
02:04:58.78 --> 02:05:04.62
New Zealand's freaking awesome. I'm man. It's freaking wonderful. The people are awesome. Yeah, that places

1953
02:05:05.18 --> 02:05:11.42
That's like more easy. You know, yeah, like so cool. That's one of the places I want to take you in like this

1954
02:05:11.42 --> 02:05:14.06
Like okay, yeah, that's one place I went to I was like

1955
02:05:14.86 --> 02:05:20.94
This is just awesome like I could live there. Oh in a minute in a minute I could live yeah that place is freaking amazing. Yeah

1956
02:05:23.50 --> 02:05:29.42
If you could go back in time and give yourself one piece of advice before joining the teams what would that be?

1957
02:05:29.42 --> 02:05:44.70
I don't know. I don't think nothing. I wouldn't do it any differently. I liked I could say

1958
02:05:45.34 --> 02:05:51.50
I would have did this but I'm glad I did stuff like as a knucklehead and had some hard knocks and

1959
02:05:51.50 --> 02:06:01.02
no, I don't know. I wouldn't have done anything differently because the good, the bad stuff that I went through

1960
02:06:01.58 --> 02:06:06.38
made me better and a good, you know, that kind of shit but yeah

1961
02:06:10.38 --> 02:06:15.42
That's one of those questions too. You know, there's people that ask

1962
02:06:15.42 --> 02:06:20.78
There's and I there's people that ask these kind of questions. They're looking for

1963
02:06:21.98 --> 02:06:28.06
They're looking for like a one like a one thing answer of like you know if you could tell yourself

1964
02:06:28.06 --> 02:06:33.98
There's another if you if you go back and tell yourself your 20 year old self what would you tell yourself like it's or

1965
02:06:35.10 --> 02:06:37.10
Invest in

1966
02:06:37.10 --> 02:06:39.90
What is it apple apple or whatever

1967
02:06:39.90 --> 02:06:48.46
I'll never know what's the one leadership lesson you like there's always that kind of thing or

1968
02:06:50.46 --> 02:06:57.10
They ask it about everything, man. I ask it about everything. What's the one book you would what's in it?

1969
02:06:57.10 --> 02:07:02.54
They ask the same kind of question that there is never an answer. Yeah, I mean it's like

1970
02:07:02.54 --> 02:07:11.34
What I figured out early on is like, okay, you know, what book about face somebody asked me that in the live podcast

1971
02:07:12.38 --> 02:07:16.78
And like I talk about I've been talking about about face since I started talking to

1972
02:07:17.10 --> 02:07:21.82
Backboard in the public. Yeah, hi, he's awesome. And so this guy at the live podcast New York

1973
02:07:22.46 --> 02:07:27.66
Some guys says if you could recommend one book and I'm like is anyone over the answer everyone's like about face

1974
02:07:27.66 --> 02:07:34.86
It was like I was not in the game right. Yeah, I was gonna ask him that question or you could easily say like remember like cracked magazine

1975
02:07:35.42 --> 02:07:37.42
Yeah, that was about the same

1976
02:07:37.66 --> 02:07:41.74
Yeah, so it's weird. I'm not trying to you know, it's like people want to hear

1977
02:07:42.14 --> 02:07:47.26
They want the information to be so distilled down, but it's kind of like this kind of you gotta do the work

1978
02:07:47.26 --> 02:07:53.10
Yeah, it's kind of like being in Gigi to be like well, what's the one move you should know in Gigi? It's like you know there actually is not one move

1979
02:07:53.10 --> 02:07:55.10
So asking Tony

1980
02:07:55.10 --> 02:07:57.10
What the one piece of advice it's like

1981
02:07:57.10 --> 02:07:59.10
Man like we're

1982
02:08:00.06 --> 02:08:04.54
What is that where do you stick to guns probably is good?

1983
02:08:05.34 --> 02:08:11.42
Don't don't give up when you know don't like get away from you like I don't

1984
02:08:11.42 --> 02:08:14.22
I want to say principles like hate that word, but

1985
02:08:14.78 --> 02:08:18.46
You know whatever you believe it like the teams like for me does like no

1986
02:08:19.02 --> 02:08:22.14
You know we know you don't do the action don't do that like

1987
02:08:23.50 --> 02:08:25.50
If I'm running a crew and

1988
02:08:25.50 --> 02:08:26.78
And

1989
02:08:26.78 --> 02:08:34.14
Everybody wants to make more time off and then you kind of give in and now now here's what we're fucking doing that's it

1990
02:08:34.86 --> 02:08:36.86
If you stick to that and

1991
02:08:38.46 --> 02:08:41.50
You can't blow up you know this time of bomb that already went off

1992
02:08:42.30 --> 02:08:48.62
So just stick to what you're doing unless it's so fucked up of course, but you know I had this

1993
02:08:49.18 --> 02:08:53.50
My uh my second-pulting commander the real squared away guy

1994
02:08:53.50 --> 02:08:57.10
But we did a hydro at

1995
02:08:57.82 --> 02:09:02.70
Camp Hamilton and like we went to red be it was a freaking nightmare it was freezing

1996
02:09:02.70 --> 02:09:03.90
The waves were huge

1997
02:09:03.90 --> 02:09:05.90
We go out we do it

1998
02:09:05.90 --> 02:09:09.26
It's fraud man shit and then we we get everything recovered

1999
02:09:09.26 --> 02:09:12.86
We come back we sit there in the zodiac typing up the freaking

2000
02:09:14.06 --> 02:09:21.26
Message with the little codes in it for how the beaches we come back we get in we draw them you know the cartabra for guys

2001
02:09:21.26 --> 02:09:27.10
Draw take all that information and draw the maps and blah blah blah and we and then the Marines launch

2002
02:09:27.10 --> 02:09:33.34
We've been we land the Marines yeah, yeah, and then the Marines weren't happy with what they did

2003
02:09:34.06 --> 02:09:37.10
They weren't happy with the landing so they go reload

2004
02:09:37.82 --> 02:09:42.30
So the next night they're like okay, we you guys gonna go do it. We're doing the whole thing again

2005
02:09:42.94 --> 02:09:48.14
Everything again. Yeah, so hydro recon so we go out and all of us boys were like

2006
02:09:48.14 --> 02:09:55.42
You know we just did the hydro you know not just change. Yeah, nothing changed and that boss that

2007
02:09:55.42 --> 02:09:57.42
Oh, I see he goes

2008
02:09:57.42 --> 02:10:05.26
That's not the point he goes he goes I remember it clear his day because I'll never forget him saying this because I use this quote in about a million times with all my guys

2009
02:10:06.22 --> 02:10:11.02
He goes you're right he goes you hey guys we don't have to do the hydro again

2010
02:10:12.86 --> 02:10:14.86
But would that be the right thing to do?

2011
02:10:14.86 --> 02:10:21.42
Yeah, you got and I was like get your lead lines boys. I mean that's how right you're big

2012
02:10:21.42 --> 02:10:26.70
It's critical is the guy in the mirror. Yeah, that's the one you got answered to not anyone else got in the mirror

2013
02:10:26.70 --> 02:10:31.74
Yeah, that that like I never forgot that from then on from the rest of my life

2014
02:10:31.74 --> 02:10:34.78
It's been like what's the actual right thing to do right now?

2015
02:10:34.78 --> 02:10:39.66
Yeah, what's the actual right thing to do? It's usually the one that's so fucked up in the hottest way

2016
02:10:39.66 --> 02:10:42.86
Yeah, it's gonna suck. Yeah, it's like everything

2017
02:10:42.86 --> 02:10:44.86
Well, I could do this or I could do that

2018
02:10:45.90 --> 02:10:49.66
No, which one's hotter? Yeah, well, then that's the one that I probably should do

2019
02:10:50.54 --> 02:10:57.58
You know in nine times out of ten you're gonna be right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is suck this way's easy, but this way sucks

2020
02:10:59.18 --> 02:11:01.18
Okay, but that's the one I have to do

2021
02:11:02.46 --> 02:11:10.30
But then you if not you're just like I should have did this, but I'm just all we can stupid and then you just get all mad

2022
02:11:10.30 --> 02:11:14.78
You end up doing that anyway, so my just doing it over with

2023
02:11:16.06 --> 02:11:18.06
um

2024
02:11:18.54 --> 02:11:24.78
As a sniper team leader prepping for deployment in your opinion one of the top five things I should drill in my guys

2025
02:11:25.58 --> 02:11:31.74
On two support combat operations limited range time about one range every other month

2026
02:11:31.74 --> 02:11:41.42
I Wouldn't be so concerned about range time I'd be concerned about environmental shooting like night time

2027
02:11:42.70 --> 02:11:44.70
low light

2028
02:11:44.38 --> 02:11:46.38
sundown son up

2029
02:11:48.78 --> 02:11:50.78
Communication

2030
02:11:51.02 --> 02:11:57.82
To any other not so much like sniper spotter like everything was this put yourself in a

2031
02:11:57.82 --> 02:12:02.54
And a 360 degree you know white side black side whatever

2032
02:12:03.34 --> 02:12:07.98
And communicate okay, you got guys all around how we doing this we got too much shit over here

2033
02:12:08.30 --> 02:12:12.14
Do we need to shift forces? Yeah, you don't need to range to do that. You don't need to range

2034
02:12:12.14 --> 02:12:14.14
You don't even need to carry weapons to do that

2035
02:12:15.18 --> 02:12:19.90
Yeah, you know, you obviously have to shoot yeah, but and then

2036
02:12:20.94 --> 02:12:24.30
Cross training all the other guys on the sniper weapon

2037
02:12:24.30 --> 02:12:26.30
Because sometimes

2038
02:12:28.22 --> 02:12:34.46
You have to take a break and you got to give somebody else who's not a sniper then you can't shoot a gun

2039
02:12:34.46 --> 02:12:37.26
I mean, it's easy but do more cross-training

2040
02:12:37.42 --> 02:12:39.42
There's no reason that

2041
02:12:39.42 --> 02:12:45.58
A non-sniper and a seal-potune shouldn't have a thousand rounds through whatever a weapon system we're using right now

2042
02:12:45.90 --> 02:12:48.94
There's no reason maybe a thousand's a little bit, but

2043
02:12:48.94 --> 02:12:54.78
That was a couple hundred this is no reason with that we're that busy, you know

2044
02:12:55.18 --> 02:13:01.82
Getting up and going to work and like running around and talking about uniform standards and but we can't I mean come on

2045
02:13:02.78 --> 02:13:06.62
We got all this time you have like no one shoot at you back here

2046
02:13:07.26 --> 02:13:14.06
So you should you maximize that time and don't get me wrong. We need time off to drink beer and be frogman, but

2047
02:13:15.18 --> 02:13:17.18
job is a job

2048
02:13:17.18 --> 02:13:21.42
What did you do to keep jacco in check?

2049
02:13:22.14 --> 02:13:24.94
Yeah nothing that's terrible

2050
02:13:26.38 --> 02:13:28.38
Ah

2051
02:13:28.38 --> 02:13:34.62
I know that's an important question to like someone who doesn't know you

2052
02:13:37.10 --> 02:13:40.06
I don't know maybe

2053
02:13:40.06 --> 02:13:49.98
Not like destroy everyone in the morning you get two sections sessions so like when they had to actually do something

2054
02:13:50.22 --> 02:13:55.98
I had to yell in their other year because I had cauliflower air fucking torqued

2055
02:13:59.74 --> 02:14:06.54
Yeah, I were basically hey man this guy not in our chain of command who's like working in another department

2056
02:14:06.54 --> 02:14:08.54
I

2057
02:14:08.54 --> 02:14:11.10
He's limited you don't know them, but I do

2058
02:14:12.46 --> 02:14:14.46
He's not you kind of got to be

2059
02:14:16.06 --> 02:14:20.06
Not a frogman, but I kind of got to be a little general of this guy because he's good at what he does

2060
02:14:20.70 --> 02:14:28.06
Just don't go in there and scare him to death because he's just gonna like fade into the the shredder room and cry

2061
02:14:28.94 --> 02:14:32.30
So you know maybe that but very limited

2062
02:14:32.30 --> 02:14:36.14
Yeah, how what you can do with this fucking guy. I don't know. I think people

2063
02:14:37.18 --> 02:14:40.78
Then we talked about this last time. It wasn't like I mean first of all

2064
02:14:41.50 --> 02:14:44.78
You and I were like if you and I looked at a target

2065
02:14:45.82 --> 02:14:50.30
We would come up with a so we both have a plan that was like almost the same thing

2066
02:14:50.62 --> 02:14:52.62
You know I

2067
02:14:52.46 --> 02:14:56.30
Because if this paper is the target like when I look at it

2068
02:14:57.82 --> 02:14:59.82
I look at it

2069
02:14:59.82 --> 02:15:03.18
There's nothing in my head, but that look at it

2070
02:15:03.74 --> 02:15:07.42
So people go oh yeah, yeah, okay, now you look at it

2071
02:15:08.78 --> 02:15:12.30
Like really really look at it and revision

2072
02:15:13.98 --> 02:15:19.10
What what this high ground here what's on top of that high ground is it trees is it how can I

2073
02:15:20.14 --> 02:15:24.94
Okay, I need to take this section of the map and I need to add the other five

2074
02:15:24.94 --> 02:15:30.42
Because we're coming from here so I'll add boom boom boom boom and this and then

2075
02:15:30.42 --> 02:15:35.34
Egress this way if this is my unique points and next thing you know the maps the size of this fucking room

2076
02:15:35.98 --> 02:15:40.14
That's how you look at it target. You know just look at go oh yeah, well I go in here

2077
02:15:40.94 --> 02:15:42.94
What who says you gotta go in?

2078
02:15:43.50 --> 02:15:53.42
There's 150 ways to do this mission, but you have to look at that target and really really look at it and then envision it in three days

2079
02:15:53.42 --> 02:15:59.26
You're walking up to that's I don't I think that's what we do pretty good. Yeah

2080
02:16:02.86 --> 02:16:09.26
I just always remember like you know some mission whether it was overseas or no matter what

2081
02:16:09.26 --> 02:16:14.70
I'd be like looking at it going I think it'd probably be good to do it like this and then you'd be like why did one

2082
02:16:14.70 --> 02:16:16.70
We do this and I like yep

2083
02:16:16.70 --> 02:16:18.70
Yeah, I mean yeah, there may be like

2084
02:16:19.42 --> 02:16:22.30
One little difference, but that's that's my new

2085
02:16:22.30 --> 02:16:24.30
Um

2086
02:16:25.50 --> 02:16:33.18
I think with BTF Tony can you share some stories about team guys that influenced you in good and bad ways during the early days and the teams

2087
02:16:34.86 --> 02:16:40.86
Oh, yeah, I mean, we've been talking about that the whole time. I think we'll be one of the reasons I picked that question was because it said in good and bad ways

2088
02:16:42.38 --> 02:16:44.62
Bad ways I just think not being

2089
02:16:44.62 --> 02:16:51.82
Totally totally 100% team guy. I've seen some guys who have been charging me that

2090
02:16:52.70 --> 02:16:56.62
You know, they just seem to at the time a little more interested and

2091
02:16:58.54 --> 02:16:59.74
You know

2092
02:16:59.74 --> 02:17:03.58
Just getting through what we were doing and not really

2093
02:17:04.30 --> 02:17:06.30
You know, it's like hey chief

2094
02:17:06.86 --> 02:17:13.10
Two weeks ago when we're doing this can I I want to bounce my notes off here as you like why don't have any notes

2095
02:17:13.10 --> 02:17:15.10
Mike. All right

2096
02:17:16.78 --> 02:17:20.54
That's terrible. That's terrible. Why don't you have any notes like

2097
02:17:21.18 --> 02:17:27.34
Isn't this like the the pinnacle of your fucking career because for me it was and you know

2098
02:17:28.62 --> 02:17:34.94
Yeah, I get it if there was no war going on but still isn't that like it's why I say some of these guys

2099
02:17:35.50 --> 02:17:39.10
We're champions like I almost respect

2100
02:17:39.10 --> 02:17:49.74
Fucking awesome cat some of them they kind of put us behind a power curve when the shit really hit the fan after nine eleven because they were just kind of going through the motions

2101
02:17:50.62 --> 02:17:54.38
And they didn't like before we got into the mobility world

2102
02:17:55.42 --> 02:17:57.42
That they didn't ever

2103
02:17:57.42 --> 02:18:00.86
They're like oh yeah, we either get dropped off by a Hugo on hump and or

2104
02:18:01.50 --> 02:18:04.46
Coming by boat like what about vehicles? Well

2105
02:18:04.46 --> 02:18:11.50
We don't really do that. Let me we don't do that how you gonna get from point eight of fucking be you know

2106
02:18:12.14 --> 02:18:14.62
And then once we started doing it it was a bunch of ketchup

2107
02:18:15.26 --> 02:18:22.62
It took fucking smart guys like TK there to really ram around the mobility program and do that kind of shit and

2108
02:18:23.66 --> 02:18:25.66
Like one of you guys think of this

2109
02:18:26.54 --> 02:18:32.14
I mean, yeah, I'm why didn't I think of it. I mean, I kind of did but I was only or low

2110
02:18:32.14 --> 02:18:36.94
Guy trying to learn the ropes, you know, and I don't think to do this any favors

2111
02:18:38.14 --> 02:18:43.18
I didn't think about it. I didn't think about mobility. I wasn't even in myself like oh cool one

2112
02:18:43.18 --> 02:18:49.50
But other guys that are that are frog man or the T1 cats were doing it. Yeah, what I what I

2113
02:18:51.26 --> 02:18:59.02
Like I was still trying to sort out like just yeah my wife. Yeah, be a good team guy, right, but yeah looking at it seems like

2114
02:18:59.02 --> 02:19:02.22
Those days there was there was

2115
02:19:04.22 --> 02:19:09.50
Seems like you would need to we needed as a community to look at like what could happen

2116
02:19:09.50 --> 02:19:17.18
One one big thing that I was looking at when I was a young team guy was I realized a long fucking time ago that

2117
02:19:18.14 --> 02:19:20.78
There are no terrorists really

2118
02:19:20.78 --> 02:19:28.78
I mean, I'm wrong about some things and if can't understand, but there are no real bad guys in the middle of fucking nowhere

2119
02:19:30.86 --> 02:19:34.46
There's gonna be buildings. There's gonna be it's not gonna be

2120
02:19:35.66 --> 02:19:39.90
Irving combat and then out in the middle of land warfare in the middle of nowhere. It's gonna be a

2121
02:19:40.62 --> 02:19:46.30
Miss and as soon as we got rid of the sub guns and started carrying long guns for close quarter bow

2122
02:19:46.70 --> 02:19:48.70
That's that's one of the styles

2123
02:19:48.70 --> 02:19:53.98
Yeah, and it was always always gonna be a mix whether you're coming over the beach. Yeah, you're coming in

2124
02:19:54.54 --> 02:19:56.54
Even going on to a ship

2125
02:19:56.54 --> 02:19:58.54
Yeah, oh yeah because people were

2126
02:19:58.78 --> 02:20:05.02
Some people want to stick with sub guns because you're going on a ship. I don't love the sub guns. Oh, yeah, for sure. They're awesome for sure

2127
02:20:05.26 --> 02:20:07.26
But at a hundred yard fan tells you

2128
02:20:08.38 --> 02:20:13.02
150 yeah, you got you could have some issues. Yeah, big issues. Yeah

2129
02:20:13.02 --> 02:20:15.98
Yeah, I

2130
02:20:15.98 --> 02:20:19.50
What point in your career did you start to feel confident in operating

2131
02:20:20.62 --> 02:20:26.22
Killing the enemy and making sure your brothers came home with you. Did you start to feel like you could do it every day and be successful?

2132
02:20:26.22 --> 02:20:28.22
Yeah, I always felt like

2133
02:20:29.26 --> 02:20:34.06
Yeah, how many platoons did it take before you started feeling confident? I like one

2134
02:20:35.02 --> 02:20:38.86
I mean, I always felt like I was good to go. Yeah, I could do this. I can

2135
02:20:38.86 --> 02:20:45.26
Fan I have fantasized about I would admit it. I couldn't wait to kill anybody. You know, I loved it

2136
02:20:45.90 --> 02:20:51.66
Because that's your job like yeah, and it was it was kind of a let down like it was like you know

2137
02:20:51.66 --> 02:20:58.14
You think like in a movie, you know, you train so much so bang all right on the next one

2138
02:20:59.10 --> 02:21:01.26
But I felt it right away

2139
02:21:01.26 --> 02:21:06.06
It's not that that was never the issue the issue has always been confident as a leader

2140
02:21:06.06 --> 02:21:08.06
Hmm

2141
02:21:08.06 --> 02:21:17.18
That took a while. It wasn't immediate it took it took me a while. How good were you as an LPL when you're any five I thought I was pretty good, but when you look back on it

2142
02:21:18.94 --> 02:21:22.38
No, I was okay because we didn't have a lot of

2143
02:21:24.22 --> 02:21:28.94
I was basically really good at the basics. Yeah, and if the I always felt like

2144
02:21:28.94 --> 02:21:35.66
Rule once I got done with a job I would rule want to go back and do it again and I'd feel like I would do it so awesome

2145
02:21:35.66 --> 02:21:40.86
And you don't get to do that right you don't I did a platoon commander. I was like um

2146
02:21:41.26 --> 02:21:45.42
And I you know, I did fine. Yeah, but like it seems like I don't know like I should have done this

2147
02:21:45.42 --> 02:21:50.06
I should have done that as it's you commander. I got done. I was like I should have done this. I should have done that

2148
02:21:50.06 --> 02:21:52.06
Just want to do better. Well absolutely

2149
02:21:53.18 --> 02:21:56.06
I mean the LPO thing when you're a piece time LPO

2150
02:21:56.06 --> 02:21:58.06
I don't know

2151
02:21:59.02 --> 02:22:01.02
Those always mix it up and

2152
02:22:01.58 --> 02:22:06.38
Everybody seemed to like me. I mean it didn't pitch too much couple guys did, but it was all good

2153
02:22:06.78 --> 02:22:10.54
You can't do everything. Yeah, all the team guys under your friggin belt

2154
02:22:11.34 --> 02:22:17.02
This is gonna be guys. Oh, he was a fucking asshole and he just fucking did this was stupid

2155
02:22:17.58 --> 02:22:20.46
Of course, it's gonna be that you know, but I think for the most part

2156
02:22:20.46 --> 02:22:27.82
I mean I did all right try to I mean I could have done better like

2157
02:22:28.70 --> 02:22:35.90
Telling people how oh, you know you're doing good and you know, it's all okay

2158
02:22:36.46 --> 02:22:45.26
No, I'm glad I was a dick kind of but we say that not a dick, but if not you say that like

2159
02:22:45.26 --> 02:22:51.74
And the late pointed me at this out to me the other day and he remembered it and it's funny because I had just written about it

2160
02:22:52.22 --> 02:22:55.42
What I wrote about was like if a pollton it at

2161
02:22:56.54 --> 02:22:58.54
Land warfare was doing good

2162
02:22:59.66 --> 02:23:05.50
I wouldn't say like this is when I was in trade it. I wouldn't say hey you guys kicked ass as a task unit

2163
02:23:05.50 --> 02:23:08.14
I wouldn't say hey you guys I'd say hey bill

2164
02:23:09.02 --> 02:23:11.26
Yeah, you and your fire team did a good job

2165
02:23:11.26 --> 02:23:17.58
Holden down the black side of that target and hey Mike when you grab that other guy and you flank those

2166
02:23:18.22 --> 02:23:20.22
Down the hill that was awesome

2167
02:23:21.18 --> 02:23:24.22
Because but I would never just say collectively

2168
02:23:24.22 --> 02:23:27.26
I know what that awesome because then what happens is they all fall apart

2169
02:23:27.58 --> 02:23:30.94
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what kind of what you did too

2170
02:23:30.94 --> 02:23:34.14
You used it if somebody if somebody did something good

2171
02:23:35.10 --> 02:23:37.10
You would tell them they did good yeah if

2172
02:23:37.10 --> 02:23:39.10
If

2173
02:23:39.10 --> 02:23:41.26
You wouldn't be like hey everyone did great no

2174
02:23:41.98 --> 02:23:46.06
Of course not because the chances of that it's like false like oh

2175
02:23:46.94 --> 02:23:51.98
You know everything who did was amazing. This is amazing everything's amazing that's so

2176
02:23:52.62 --> 02:23:57.74
Stupid I hate that like you did your job like what do you want a fucking metal

2177
02:23:58.46 --> 02:24:00.46
Now here's your metal. There's an emory

2178
02:24:01.50 --> 02:24:03.50

Go get your shit ready we got another off and besides you know

2180
02:24:08.38 --> 02:24:12.62
It's not like I talked down everybody these are my brothers like yeah, man that was cool

02:26:31.50 --> 02:26:32.86
Echo

2219
02:26:32.86 --> 02:26:35.10
Yes, speaking of standing by to get some

2220
02:26:36.38 --> 02:26:41.58
What do you got how can we be more prepared to get some as they say?

2221
02:26:41.58 --> 02:26:47.10
Anyways, all right well one way as we always say is jujitsu

2222
02:26:47.74 --> 02:26:49.98
Tony yeah, that was a little bit about that as well

2223
02:26:51.02 --> 02:26:57.90
When you do jujitsu we need geese right unless you're doing no gee but we recommend gee and no geese so when you get a gee where we get them

2224
02:26:59.50 --> 02:27:04.46
Origin so this is so Tony's from New England and you know Tony and I were talking me yesterday

2225
02:27:04.46 --> 02:27:11.42
And man if you grew up in New England then you saw the economy get just annihilated

2226
02:27:12.06 --> 02:27:13.74
Yep, and

2227
02:27:13.74 --> 02:27:15.74
Whether it was the

2228
02:27:15.74 --> 02:27:23.26
The factories that were shutting out the textile factories that were shutting down the clothing manufacturers the shoe manufacturers all these the paper

2229
02:27:23.26 --> 02:27:26.46
Manufacturers back home. Yeah got shut down and

2230
02:27:27.50 --> 02:27:30.14
You know it's one of those things that

2231
02:27:30.14 --> 02:27:35.42
When I when I talk to companies and they say well, you know you were dealing with you were doing with life and death

2232
02:27:36.30 --> 02:27:41.98
And we're not and I say yeah, but you're dealing with people's livelihoods and what what as a as a

2233
02:27:43.58 --> 02:27:48.86
A mom as a dad your livelihood is how that's your life that is your life and so

2234
02:27:49.82 --> 02:27:55.66
If you grew up in New England and and a New England's not the only place because it's all over America when you manufacturing got taken away

2235
02:27:55.66 --> 02:28:01.98
And sent overseas it's a nightmare you go up to these towns and there's no work

2236
02:28:02.54 --> 02:28:06.30
Not that people don't want to work believe me they're New Englanders they want to work

2237
02:28:06.30 --> 02:28:09.50
Yeah, and I keep saying New Englanders because but it's everywhere

2238
02:28:09.50 --> 02:28:16.78
But it's everywhere yeah Americans want to work and so you know with origin and when you come up and see the factory you know we got

2239
02:28:18.22 --> 02:28:20.70
45 or 50 folks now

2240
02:28:21.34 --> 02:28:23.34

02:29:26.30 --> 02:29:32.54
That's and this is just the starting point man. Yeah, and people people can think I'm you know dreaming

2254
02:29:33.34 --> 02:29:35.58
I'm not like we're gonna build this thing

2255
02:29:35.58 --> 02:29:42.14
It is gonna be massive we're gonna bring back manufacturing to America and there's no one's gonna stop us

2256
02:29:42.38 --> 02:29:44.94
That's what's gonna happen. It's not a no one

2257
02:29:45.50 --> 02:29:46.86
so

2258
02:29:46.86 --> 02:29:49.82

02:29:58.38 --> 02:30:03.10
And I said you know what I said you're right you're right. They are too expensive

2262
02:30:03.58 --> 02:30:06.70
Right now they're they're not at the price point. We want to get them down to

2263
02:30:07.58 --> 02:30:10.54
But as we build more and grow more

2264
02:30:10.86 --> 02:30:15.74
We'll be able to get those expenses down, but we have to start somewhere. Yeah, we came out. We usually give them away

2265
02:30:15.74 --> 02:30:20.06
No, you got to pay the people. Yeah, we got we got to pay the workers so we're getting there

2266
02:30:20.14 --> 02:30:25.66
We will build this and there's nothing's gonna stop us. Yeah, I don't think they're that expensive anyway

2267
02:30:26.06 --> 02:30:29.98
Well, well, they're cheaper they're they're more expensive than a pair of

2268
02:30:30.30 --> 02:30:31.50
Mass-produced

2269
02:30:31.50 --> 02:30:37.58
jeans from China in a sweatshop where they're playing it with their paying their employees right literally 50 cents a day

2270
02:30:37.66 --> 02:30:42.46
So yes, our jeans more expensive than I thought last forever. They're a hundred bucks

2271
02:30:42.46 --> 02:30:46.86
Don't have you buy two pairs of 200 bucks. So anyways

2272
02:30:48.06 --> 02:30:50.22
That's the deal and if you think that's

2273
02:30:51.66 --> 02:30:54.22
If you think a hundred bucks is too much, hey, man. I get it

2274
02:30:55.26 --> 02:31:00.22
Save up save up get yourself a pair of now really get yourself a pair of jeans made in China

2275
02:31:01.02 --> 02:31:09.58
That are made in a sweatshop where you know some the corporate the corporation is gonna make all the money and none of it's gonna come back here to America

2276
02:31:09.58 --> 02:31:13.42
So all right, sorry I'm getting a little crazy right now, but these back

2277
02:31:16.38 --> 02:31:19.18
If you don't buy jeans, there's other stuff too

2278
02:31:19.74 --> 02:31:26.62
Also good stuff so what supplements so important supplements to keep you in the game joined more fair cruel oil

2279
02:31:27.02 --> 02:31:33.26
Which I had an experience and didn't even know it when I went to Hawaii you went off the I went off didn't even realize that

2280
02:31:33.26 --> 02:31:35.26
You know you just

2281
02:31:35.26 --> 02:31:40.30
Off the krill oil and joint warfare and here's the weird thing my elbow I always say it can't

2282
02:31:40.30 --> 02:31:45.98
But it is your correct. Yeah, it was amateur, but and I didn't even realize it till like I don't so I go

2283
02:31:45.98 --> 02:31:52.70
You know, and I was lifting I was wearing it in 1990. Yeah, elbow. I had it so bad this one yeah

2284
02:31:53.26 --> 02:31:56.54
Yeah, if you go on the joint warfare and krill oil

2285
02:31:57.10 --> 02:32:04.70
Okay, if you don't have someone give you some it's good it takes like I guess depends on who you are to me like six days for it to like really start

2286
02:32:04.70 --> 02:32:07.18
That's only a couple days more than a cortisol shot though

2287
02:32:07.58 --> 02:32:12.70
Really, yeah, right? Yeah, it's like two and a half days you will feel it like you go and read the

2288
02:32:13.66 --> 02:32:17.10
The reviews of joint warfare and there's people that are saying oh

2289
02:32:17.66 --> 02:32:21.50
I couldn't do I couldn't I couldn't lift my whatever, you know

2290
02:32:21.50 --> 02:32:25.50
I couldn't swing my hammer whatever I'm back in the game mobility. Yeah, yeah, so

2291
02:32:26.06 --> 02:32:29.50
It's legit so I come back and I'm like okay, let me get you know back in deliver

2292
02:32:29.50 --> 02:32:33.18
I was like man. I wasn't lifting that heart in Hawaii and not as often either

2293
02:32:33.18 --> 02:32:35.18
I'm like why my elbow kind of on me

2294
02:32:35.18 --> 02:32:41.18
Oh my gosh totally hit me. That's like dang you had another instance of me playing myself

2295
02:32:41.66 --> 02:32:43.66
But proof you see I'm saying

2296
02:32:44.06 --> 02:32:49.02
Anyway, so yeah stay on that joint warfare and krill oil there is also discipline

2297
02:32:50.86 --> 02:32:55.10
Good deal, Dave's on the discipline a train big time. I'm with him on that train

2298
02:32:55.50 --> 02:33:01.82
Pretty much every day pretty much daily daily discipline. Yeah, yeah in all things and this is this is yet another one

2299
02:33:01.82 --> 02:33:07.10
Yes, also milk if you want additional protein in the form of a dessert by the way

2300
02:33:07.66 --> 02:33:12.30
What the best desserts out there. No, I never would have thought what I'll do is make a dessert

2301
02:33:13.34 --> 02:33:18.38
You that's that's got protein. I wouldn't think that because it doesn't seem like it's a possible feasible thing

2302
02:33:18.78 --> 02:33:21.58
Yeah, but then it turns out to be yes. It is one that's yeah

2303
02:33:21.58 --> 02:33:28.54
I know and you go a long time one of his favorite things is not actually a saying he's just like talking to you because you're next to him

2304
02:33:29.18 --> 02:33:31.18
going

2305
02:33:31.18 --> 02:33:33.18
Fucking starving right now

2306
02:33:35.02 --> 02:33:36.54
Always

2307
02:33:36.54 --> 02:33:41.82
Stier of it like every like okay, we know we ate like an hour and a half

2308
02:33:43.26 --> 02:33:46.26

02:33:50.54 --> 02:33:52.54
Intermittent fasting

It gets a milk. Yeah, it gets good get some tea some jocquait tea and

2313
02:33:58.94 --> 02:34:05.10
And that'll and don't forget about the warrior kid milk. Yeah, which I think is the game changer

2314
02:34:05.98 --> 02:34:12.70
Hey, it's gonna be guys from back home a lot of guys watch podcast, but can you just go over the

2315
02:34:14.22 --> 02:34:16.78
The dot com again whatever it is or

2316
02:34:16.78 --> 02:34:18.78
George and main

2317
02:34:18.78 --> 02:34:22.30
dot com main as in the state right MA I any

2318
02:34:22.86 --> 02:34:25.98
Yeah, yeah, or do mean that comes we get all this stuff

2319
02:34:25.98 --> 02:34:28.94
Also jocquait as a store it's called

2320
02:34:29.82 --> 02:34:36.94
Jocco store of course you're super creative with the names and what not put a lot of thought and Jim and it's good turned out good

2321
02:34:37.26 --> 02:34:39.66
Anyway, that's where you can get that's shirts

2322
02:34:40.54 --> 02:34:44.70
Who was it it was I think Flynn Cochran

2323
02:34:46.38 --> 02:34:50.70
He was he was saying that the original jocco product

2324
02:34:50.70 --> 02:34:59.18
Was because I used to give like a brief the leadership brief to the guys that were starting and he's like they they called that the jocco brief

2325
02:34:59.82 --> 02:35:04.22
And I think about it. Oh, yeah, that's like the original the original jocco product

2326
02:35:04.86 --> 02:35:10.46
And then so I can't be just blamed on lack of creativity from my part. Well, yeah, yeah, I guess I can

2327
02:35:10.46 --> 02:35:12.46
Yeah, just full on 100% actually

2328
02:35:14.46 --> 02:35:17.74
And also you got asked the question did Flynn come up with that

2329
02:35:17.74 --> 02:35:25.74
After no jocco bucket no it was it was it was and then Mike's really same thing like all this yeah

2330
02:35:25.74 --> 02:35:30.70
The jocco brief you know what though when you kind of think about it what you call it like phonetically or whatever

2331
02:35:30.70 --> 02:35:36.62
I don't know if that's the correct word, but like when you say jocco it's kind of matches, you know like jocco store

2332
02:35:36.62 --> 02:35:39.74
Jocco brief it's not like it's like you know

2333
02:35:40.78 --> 02:35:46.38
You know, yeah, the whole reason to speak you know that story that you just told about me being hungry

2334
02:35:46.38 --> 02:35:51.66
The reason this whole thing started with jocco is because when I was on Tim Ferriss's podcast

2335
02:35:52.38 --> 02:35:56.86
I fasted that day and he was like well, you know, we've been talking for a long time

2336
02:35:56.86 --> 02:35:59.82
You maybe we should go get something eat and I went jocco hungry

2337
02:36:01.66 --> 02:36:05.90
Like I was just joking, you know, but then but not really but then like a little while later

2338
02:36:05.90 --> 02:36:11.54
It was oh, we're gonna have a podcast and I was like okay jocco podcast almost like I'm a knucklehead right

2339
02:36:11.54 --> 02:36:14.14
Or oh no way I actually have a nut

2340
02:36:14.14 --> 02:36:19.46
It's a really good jocco podcast that was the original but it sounds good

2341
02:36:20.46 --> 02:36:27.34
Unless it's like if you're gonna name something like that start to then oh that's when it wouldn't really work like if it was like a

2342
02:36:28.78 --> 02:36:30.78
Ocean jocco ocean

2343
02:36:31.90 --> 02:36:36.42
That kind of sounds good I guess no, you take over an ocean somewhere well, you know

2344
02:36:36.42 --> 02:36:38.42
Hypothetically

2345
02:36:38.42 --> 02:36:43.90
She's a jocco store so you can get shirts this little equals freedom boom more rash cards on there too

2346
02:36:43.90 --> 02:36:46.54
By the way, which are which are origin rash cards?

2347
02:36:46.54 --> 02:36:49.54
Yes, they made America jocco taco

2348
02:36:49.94 --> 02:36:54.06
Jocco that would be good. No, no, that works. You know a good jocco taco. Oh, yeah

2349
02:36:54.62 --> 02:36:57.38
There's a place like a poco's tacos shop

2350
02:36:57.86 --> 02:37:01.12
That'll be the jocco beef. I need to start a taco shop. Wow

2351
02:37:01.12 --> 02:37:09.10
One hot yeah, man as well obviously choose we'll have to talk to George and he's a judge far fan yeah

2352
02:37:09.10 --> 02:37:12.60
Oh, yeah, maybe can't find one taco drop around here

2353
02:37:12.60 --> 02:37:19.42
Yeah, yeah, we might get with my oldest daughter who's the college now my oldest daughter comes home then she'll like fly home and

2354
02:37:19.80 --> 02:37:24.60
She will stop at a taco shop. Oh, yeah, and so yeah, we've gone from the airport

2355
02:37:24.60 --> 02:37:29.04
That's just like a side of the whole coast looking for to see you you're gonna be home in 10 minutes

2356
02:37:29.04 --> 02:37:32.40
He's like no, no, no, I'm gonna have an hour because I'm gonna get a taco. Oh, absolutely

2357
02:37:32.68 --> 02:37:37.12
Going to California, burrito. Oh, I had like three of the last four days

2364
02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:16.88
For the children stories not just questions, but stories from Uncle Jake about how Uncle Jake

2365
02:38:17.76 --> 02:38:21.80
Got his values in life. What made him say?

2366
02:38:22.80 --> 02:38:26.36
I should be prepared. You know on the how I tell a story

2367
02:38:26.36 --> 02:38:33.32
Uncle Jake goes on a little on a little there's there's a little robot and Uncle Jake and his buddy

2368
02:38:33.60 --> 02:38:36.32
When he's eight years old go out on the robot and

2369
02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:41.08
While they're out in the robot he says, you know, we're not going to need life jackets because you know

2370
02:38:41.08 --> 02:38:43.32
We're just gonna nice day. Yeah, we're just gonna paddle around here

2371
02:38:43.88 --> 02:38:48.52
So they're out in the robot and they're clowning around whatever let go of the horse for a second

2372
02:38:48.52 --> 02:38:50.52
They both slip out through the

2373
02:38:50.52 --> 02:38:52.52
through the or locks

2374
02:38:52.52 --> 02:38:59.36
And there's a wind blowing so within five seconds they're they're gone from the inner and middle of the lake

2375
02:38:59.36 --> 02:39:02.84
Yeah, and they have to drift all the way to the other side and

2376
02:39:03.56 --> 02:39:07.84
Then borrow some, but you know there was that moment where new things were bad

2377
02:39:08.28 --> 02:39:09.32
Yeah

2378
02:39:09.32 --> 02:39:14.76
So that's when Uncle Jake learned you need to always be prepared for things to go down

2379
02:39:15.08 --> 02:39:19.36
That's an actual story too by the way that really happened to me

2380
02:39:19.36 --> 02:39:22.44
So there you go story's Michael Jake on a warrior kid podcast

2381
02:39:23.36 --> 02:39:25.36
So

2382
02:39:25.36 --> 02:39:28.000
Get some of that also speaking of where your kids

2383
02:39:28.40 --> 02:39:34.16
It's a worry kid that I know heard of myth not a man not real name is eight in

2384
02:39:34.84 --> 02:39:39.48
Making warrior kids not worry kids so Pajaco so he's the warrior kid

2385
02:39:39.48 --> 02:39:41.76
That's the now we got chocolate soap too

2386
02:39:41.92 --> 02:39:46.32
Jocco things are getting out of here. And that's a good dude. Jocco soap. There's also trooper soap by the way

2387
02:39:46.32 --> 02:39:52.12
Which is like another witty called flavor if you will soap not flavors right don't you just like

2388
02:39:52.80 --> 02:39:58.80
To use it to wash up and it will help you stay clean. Yes very good smells like

2389
02:40:03.12 --> 02:40:09.04
To be honest, yeah, hey, that would be awesome. It smells like war that smelled like corn. I eat or whatever

2390
02:40:09.04 --> 02:40:16.04
Oh, yeah, I'm so good. Yeah, yeah, it smells like napalm that victory in the morning

2391
02:40:16.60 --> 02:40:18.84
We'll dock away tea tastes like victory

2392
02:40:20.08 --> 02:40:27.28
Well, yeah, you know what you say it it should smell like war that kind sort of maybe think of how you and life and actually all you guys would tell us how it war

2393
02:40:27.28 --> 02:40:29.28
Smells like some powder in the sewage

2394
02:40:30.28 --> 02:40:32.28
That's actually the terrible idea

2395
02:40:33.28 --> 02:40:35.28
After the range

2396
02:40:35.28 --> 02:40:43.52
The range smells good. You know what does this about good diesel fumes in the back of a sea fox now or when you're in a halo and refueling

2397
02:40:44.72 --> 02:40:49.40
Like air and in flight refueling. I don't think I've ever done that that's

2398
02:40:50.40 --> 02:40:53.20
After Tara's just diesel every once just like

2399
02:40:55.20 --> 02:40:57.20
It's like

2400
02:40:57.20 --> 02:40:59.52
And I don't like ever get sick but that stuff, but I was like

2401
02:40:59.52 --> 02:41:08.08
I've gotten I've gotten I got c-c-2 times once was in the back of the sea fox fell asleep with the diesel fumes just in and then

2402
02:41:08.08 --> 02:41:14.88
Next one was an LCU I was downstairs and a raging storm water proofing the radios in the engine room

2403
02:41:14.88 --> 02:41:22.48
It just diesel rocking all in the place I came up and started yacking and the and the BMC that was run in the LCU was hanging is that over the side

2404
02:41:22.48 --> 02:41:28.80
Yeah, I was like alright. I'm cleared hot technically is that getting seasick though if it's from the Gulf you? I

2405
02:41:30.08 --> 02:41:36.88
Don't know yeah, I never did it. So yeah, you got seasick. Yeah, see never happened to me. There you go

2406
02:41:38.80 --> 02:41:41.52
Nonetheless the the the scent

2407
02:41:42.16 --> 02:41:44.16
aroma of

2408
02:41:44.40 --> 02:41:50.80
The troopers open the jocosope is pretty good. Okay, and very functional by the way you still talk is not that

2409
02:41:50.80 --> 02:41:54.000
Yeah, that's very important. I mean we could talk about the diesel fuel

2410
02:41:54.72 --> 02:41:55.68
Spumes

2411
02:41:55.68 --> 02:42:02.72
Thysicness somewhere if you don't want true. I'll take the hit nicely. No, no, I'm taking up to you

2412
02:42:03.44 --> 02:42:06.72
Doing a good job anyway. I'll take the hit also we have a YouTube channel

2413
02:42:07.84 --> 02:42:09.52
BTF Tony into YouTube but what?

2414
02:42:10.48 --> 02:42:14.32
Not really but yeah, yeah, I would I would be surprised if you were but you did

2415
02:42:14.88 --> 02:42:19.44
Dictip various videos nonetheless. We have a YouTube channel with good videos video version of this podcast

2416
02:42:19.44 --> 02:42:27.12
Exerps enhanced excerpts enhanced means that echo puts all these effects it on

2417
02:42:27.92 --> 02:42:29.92
Like a oh, I got to watch that

2418
02:42:29.92 --> 02:42:31.92
I got these explosions

2419
02:42:32.72 --> 02:42:34.72
These are on fire

2420
02:42:34.72 --> 02:42:41.76
So you want to have this absolutely yeah, but yeah, YouTube channel jocopotcast boom also psychological warfare

2421
02:42:42.56 --> 02:42:47.28
Psychological warfare. Yeah, what is that brown? It's an always get mad at me

2422
02:42:47.28 --> 02:42:53.44
Explaining it. You know have the best exit go to here's here's a psychological if you ask for an alarm clock

2423
02:42:53.92 --> 02:42:57.68
Which is kind of where they started if you're if you're asking for an alarm clock

2424
02:42:58.56 --> 02:43:02.24
That as me telling you to get up there's where you get it psychological warfare

2425
02:43:02.32 --> 02:43:05.04
It's on iTunes and song Google play it's on MP3

2426
02:43:05.68 --> 02:43:12.48
It actually started when echo asked me a question about something and I was like here's the answer and then he was like

2427
02:43:12.48 --> 02:43:14.88
I'm gonna record that and then we just

2428
02:43:14.88 --> 02:43:17.52
One from there. Yeah, that's cool the question was

2429
02:43:18.72 --> 02:43:23.12
Yeah, we don't press it one and it was with me was with workout so like when I work out or when I

2430
02:43:23.52 --> 02:43:27.60
Plan a workout and it just really don't feel like it and you know that's a common thing like

2431
02:43:27.60 --> 02:43:30.72
Yeah, you just do it anyway. You don't be a BTF through it. Right

2432
02:43:31.36 --> 02:43:34.16
Some thinking man. I wish I was better at BTF

2433
02:43:34.88 --> 02:43:36.16
In through it

2434
02:43:36.16 --> 02:43:38.48
Seems saying I was too lately

2435
02:43:38.48 --> 02:43:44.000
I know about seat it's a real thing so I'm like I want you know because I can imagine you know jockel just be TF through it

2436
02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:47.44
So I'm like, but what do you like say you know like what what goes on in your mind?

2437
02:43:47.44 --> 02:43:53.20
Do you just not think about it at all and you just sort of automatically do it? Do you say something or I don't know like what is it?

2438
02:43:53.20 --> 02:43:58.24
You know what's the message? I like two weeks ago. I turned 51 and I'm like

2439
02:44:00.56 --> 02:44:02.56
Actually made it past 50

2440
02:44:04.08 --> 02:44:06.80
Get a fucking beat this it's got to do some right

2441
02:44:06.80 --> 02:44:13.04
Yeah, you know especially when you think you're gonna not make it the 30 first year. Oh, yeah, I'm like

2442
02:44:14.24 --> 02:44:19.76
I don't know there you go. It doesn't get any the old the everyday you get all there it gets terrible

2443
02:44:21.36 --> 02:44:23.36
You wake up you're like oh what is this now

2444
02:44:24.96 --> 02:44:26.24
Like here

2445
02:44:26.24 --> 02:44:31.44
What's this? I realized you know how I've said one of the things I

2446
02:44:31.44 --> 02:44:37.60
Notice about getting older is and I don't notice that much and I don't admit that

2447
02:44:38.88 --> 02:44:42.16
So even if I was in a ton of pain, I wouldn't tell anyone

2448
02:44:42.56 --> 02:44:47.12
But one of the things that I have admitted is that my first couple rounds of jujitsu

2449
02:44:47.92 --> 02:44:50.80
I'm I'm I use a couple rounds of warm up now

2450
02:44:50.80 --> 02:44:53.84
You know especially especially if I'm going with

2451
02:44:54.64 --> 02:44:59.76
Dean and Andy so Andy didn't used to be in this bracket. He's in there now

2452
02:44:59.76 --> 02:45:01.76
So

2453
02:45:01.76 --> 02:45:03.76
He's the other thing I noticed I

2454
02:45:04.32 --> 02:45:08.56
Once my because I couldn't run when I heard my knee and so now that my knees like

2455
02:45:09.12 --> 02:45:13.68
Getting better I can run again not you know crazy but what I noticed is

2456
02:45:15.04 --> 02:45:20.40
Same thing if the first like the first half mile that I run

2457
02:45:21.44 --> 02:45:25.44
I just I must look like a person that's just never run

2458
02:45:25.44 --> 02:45:31.04
Or even and then the longer I run when I mean the first half that you run more

2459
02:45:33.04 --> 02:45:37.04
Like what did you do when I'm coming home and I'm once I'm warmed up

2460
02:45:37.44 --> 02:45:39.44
I'm like oh yeah cool cool

2461
02:45:39.44 --> 02:45:42.16
Then that's one thing that sucks is when you were young

2462
02:45:42.40 --> 02:45:44.80
You just didn't have to do anything and you'd show to you

2463
02:45:44.80 --> 02:45:48.24
You didn't do anything for three months and then you show up at a team

2464
02:45:48.24 --> 02:45:51.52
They're like hey we're doing a nine mile one today. You bet cold just go out and do it and you find

2465
02:45:51.52 --> 02:45:55.28
Now you like the first first half mile

2466
02:45:56.72 --> 02:45:58.72
You got a flat tail like what run this shit

2467
02:46:05.28 --> 02:46:07.28
Yeah, if you want a

2468
02:46:07.68 --> 02:46:09.68
Visual version

2469
02:46:09.68 --> 02:46:12.08
Of little things to keep you on the path

2470
02:46:12.24 --> 02:46:19.60
Then go to flipsidecampus.com to code a Meyer. He's got a company there again made in America made right in Austin Texas

2472
02:46:23.04 --> 02:46:28.40
Art work I'm trying to think of a better word for that because I don't like saying artwork you don't match I know same

2473
02:46:29.20 --> 02:46:31.20
I know but is it a better word?

2474
02:46:32.40 --> 02:46:36.64
I don't know no I think it's artwork visual inspirational

2475
02:46:36.88 --> 02:46:39.12
Shep, you know inspirational might be worse

2476
02:46:39.76 --> 02:46:43.68
Inspiration I mean as far as John was saying it I dig it it's inspirational stuff

2477
02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.88
factually but we know it for lack of a better turn

2478
02:46:46.88 --> 02:46:51.52

teammates in Afghanistan was all right man. We'll see on the flipside and everyone on his team died

2482
02:47:04.96 --> 02:47:08.16
I include in that guy and so he's like that's what this is that's what the name is

Graphics that better. I fix on there but that's not the end product

2486
02:47:23.44 --> 02:47:27.68
I'm gonna think of something eventually maybe I'll make up a word for it like mok. Yeah, maybe

2487
02:47:27.68 --> 02:47:31.44
Yeah, I think you did do that. I think about it watch this

2488
02:47:32.16 --> 02:47:34.64

2490
02:47:40.40 --> 02:47:46.72
There's some cool. Do you have Sam, do you do sand bass did you watch my uh little clip I put out my edit

2491
02:47:48.80 --> 02:47:55.36
The time lapse. Yeah, I did I didn't pay max attention so you got sand bags on there. Yeah, okay

2492
02:47:55.36 --> 02:47:57.12
Because I was on yeah

2493
02:47:57.36 --> 02:48:01.44
By the way, friends and one that that band that I clipped out there it's called life's blood

2494
02:48:01.44 --> 02:48:06.72
It's an old school hardcore band from upstate New York. That's from an old seven inch

2495
02:48:06.72 --> 02:48:12.000
That Elgin James sent me because we we there was a great band. They're great band

2496
02:48:12.72 --> 02:48:16.80
They're the lead singer is now a cop somewhere in Atlanta or something

2497
02:48:17.52 --> 02:48:22.72
But anyways that's life's blood. I don't know where you can find it, but that's the music

2498
02:48:22.72 --> 02:48:30.48
That's the music that I edited in the hell. Yeah, I'm gonna take echoes job from them. That's friggin dangerous

2499
02:48:30.48 --> 02:48:35.84
There won't maybe I'll take over actual in front. Maybe do the briefings on that. Yeah, let's see yeah, maybe I will check

2500
02:48:36.48 --> 02:48:42.80
So anyway what I was trying to say about the sand bags is when I was getting stuff yeah

2501
02:48:42.80 --> 02:48:47.04
From on it I saw the sand bags. I was like I'm gonna get this. I don't have a sand bag routine yet

2502
02:48:47.36 --> 02:48:51.52
For those who don't wonder what I was doing the sand bag. I picked it up a throw it off my shoulder turn around pick it up

2503
02:48:51.52 --> 02:48:56.08
Throw my one of my shoulder. Oh, yeah, I'll be because it I don't have a year

2504
02:48:56.08 --> 02:48:58.08
I don't know just I don't know

2505
02:48:58.08 --> 02:49:02.64
My son when he came home from wrestling camp and he was like, you know kind of

2514
02:49:39.44 --> 02:49:43.44
When he came home from that, you know he was kind of bowing up a little bit. Oh, yeah

2515
02:49:43.44 --> 02:49:46.32
That didn't happen. Yeah, he was bowing up and I said oh you went to a little one

That I was talking about earlier that thread

2585
02:55:07.60 --> 02:55:11.52
Through the years when there was no war going on there is plenty of people that

2586
02:55:11.52 --> 02:55:17.20
That you know they did their job and they went on their deployments or whatever you were freaking tone the line man

You were tone the line and and keep in that knowledge base improving that knowledge base

Thanks for everything you did for bruiser of course

2591
02:55:36.72 --> 02:55:42.64
And as far as I'm concerned you're actually the model of the American fighting man

2592
02:55:43.84 --> 02:55:45.84
You're the mother fucker

2593
02:55:46.16 --> 02:55:54.16
That went up against the Japanese and the Nazis and said you know what we don't care what kind of warrior culture that you have

2594
02:55:54.24 --> 02:55:58.88
We got something else where Americans and we're about to fuck you up. That's great

2595
02:55:59.60 --> 02:56:02.48
We got something that none of you other countries have

2596
02:56:02.48 --> 02:56:07.28
I'm gonna go what like fucking John Wayne

2597
02:56:08.24 --> 02:56:12.08
If you can produce anyone a quarter as good as that man

2598
02:56:12.56 --> 02:56:15.76
Then I'll maybe listen to you we have fucking John Wayne

2599
02:56:16.88 --> 02:56:18.88
Best guy ever in the history of ever

2600
02:56:20.24 --> 02:56:24.56
You know, you know if you might or solve to him in everyday life then you got an unknowable

2601
02:56:25.04 --> 02:56:28.16
What would John Wayne do he there go yes now or punch you

2602
02:56:28.72 --> 02:56:30.72
Good on and then you have a bunch of whiskey

2603
02:56:30.72 --> 02:56:39.44
And then you know shoot a bunch of people and get on his horse and go have a steak and smoke like 200 cigarettes good plan

2604
02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
Good plan a

2605
02:56:43.52 --> 02:56:46.72
Awesome everyone else all the other veterans out there that have served

2606
02:56:47.12 --> 02:56:49.76

2607
02:56:50.48 --> 02:56:57.28
Thanks for what you continue to do to our police and law enforcement and firefighters paramedics EMTs dispatchers

2608

2609
02:57:06.32 --> 02:57:08.32

2610
02:57:08.40 --> 02:57:10.40
to everyone else out there

2611
02:57:11.92 --> 02:57:13.92
You know

2612
02:57:14.24 --> 02:57:18.80
You're gonna make mistakes you're not gonna be perfect things are gonna go wrong

2613
02:57:20.24 --> 02:57:22.24
And when things go wrong

2614
02:57:22.24 --> 02:57:28.72
It's pretty easy just to say you know what I'm gonna stand down and I'm gonna take a knee or I'm gonna give up

2615
02:57:29.84 --> 02:57:31.84
And you can do that

2616
02:57:32.72 --> 02:57:36.56
Or you can do what Tony would do which is grab your gear

2617
02:57:38.08 --> 02:57:39.52
Then just grab a night

2618
02:57:40.72 --> 02:57:44.56
F until you get things back on

2619
02:57:45.52 --> 02:57:47.52
track

2620
02:57:47.52 --> 02:57:49.52
And that's what I recommend you do

2621
02:57:49.52 --> 02:57:51.52
So until next time

2622
02:57:51.52 --> 02:58:14.08
This is BTF Tony and echo and jacco out
