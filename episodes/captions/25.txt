00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.24 This is Jocco podcast number 25 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willick and once again
00:00:11.52 --> 00:00:13.52 We have this evening
00:00:14.52 --> 00:00:18.48 Jody Middick and if you didn't listen to the last podcast
00:00:19.20 --> 00:00:24.08 This is our first double guest. He's been on the podcast twice. We
00:00:24.72 --> 00:00:29.60 Went so long on the first podcast that we had to break it up into two podcasts
00:00:29.60 --> 00:00:35.12 But Jody had a lot of been through a lot of stuff had a lot of stuff to talk about
00:00:36.40 --> 00:00:40.48 Canadian army soldier sniper served in Afghanistan
00:00:41.68 --> 00:00:47.92 Remember the city council up in Ottawa. He's been on TV. He wrote this book right here boom
00:00:49.20 --> 00:00:53.12 It's called unflinching the making of a Canadian sniper and
00:00:53.12 --> 00:00:58.48 And he was wounded in Afghanistan
00:00:59.44 --> 00:01:02.88 Lost double amputee below the knees and
00:01:04.08 --> 00:01:09.36 We talked about that on the first podcast if you have on podcast number 24 if you haven't listened that one
00:01:09.36 --> 00:01:12.96 Listen that one first so you get the context of what we're about to go into tonight
00:01:13.84 --> 00:01:19.24 But welcome to the show once again Jody awesome, and thank you appreciate it echo Charles good evening
00:01:19.84 --> 00:01:21.84 Good evening
00:01:21.84 --> 00:01:23.84 so
00:01:25.28 --> 00:01:30.80 Well this one since we already talked for a long time on the first one didn't feel like a long time
00:01:30.80 --> 00:01:35.72 No, it didn't but this time we got some we did get some questions from the interwebs and
00:01:36.72 --> 00:01:43.40 It was now. Do you strictly pull from Twitter or do you get email? I get Facebook and
00:01:44.48 --> 00:01:48.72 What about your Instagram okay the problem with Instagram is you can't copy and paste from Instagram
00:01:48.72 --> 00:01:55.08 It's all my phone into the document that I travel with and you're going so Twitter is the one that
00:01:55.44 --> 00:01:56.96 Twitter's the easiest one
00:01:56.96 --> 00:02:02.24 Facebook's fine to but I primarily use Twitter to get the questions from all the troopers out there
00:02:02.72 --> 00:02:07.44 That and it keeps the question short yes, you have 140 characters yeah
00:02:08.08 --> 00:02:12.40 And we know I have got now so I have something called the the question
00:02:12.84 --> 00:02:18.08 podcast question bank right which I've caught captured every question that anyone's ever asked me
00:02:18.08 --> 00:02:23.80 They're in there and I just every time I you know you got a chance of coming up in the lottery every time
00:02:23.80 --> 00:02:28.000 Nice because I go through it and I go through all from the beginning and just look for questions that are pertinent
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.28 Maybe the pertinent of the topic that I'm talking about that night
00:02:31.36 --> 00:02:34.60 Maybe it's pertinent to something that's going on right in the world
00:02:35.08 --> 00:02:39.80 But I just pick them and say oh yeah, that that's a question that people have or I'll see repetitive question
00:02:39.80 --> 00:02:44.84 People a bunch of different people ask me the same thing and then that becomes one of the questions
00:02:44.84 --> 00:02:48.44 But that's kind of how we've been doing it right so do you do you find you get
00:02:49.04 --> 00:02:58.04 Because you you know we I don't want to hash out too much, but like your podcast went from non-existent to number one and about like
00:02:58.64 --> 00:03:02.34 Six days something crazy like that like you you left the Joe Rogan podcast
00:03:02.84 --> 00:03:13.04 Did you did started your own hit number one and like now like do you get too much correspondence like how do you keep up like I've noticed you are your like you must make
00:03:13.04 --> 00:03:18.72 Twitter a daily pass. Oh, I have to. Yeah, and I be honest with you
00:03:18.72 --> 00:03:23.16 I don't know how long I'm going to be able to keep it up for yeah because so you're approaching critical mass
00:03:23.16 --> 00:03:27.28 I'm approaching critical mass where I'm going to have to what I'm not going to be able to do because right now
00:03:27.80 --> 00:03:30.000 I read every thing
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.68 I'll probably always read them all I mean, I just get crazy, but I
00:03:34.40 --> 00:03:39.92 I at least read them and I'll try and respond if it's something quick if it's not something I can respond to immediately
00:03:39.92 --> 00:03:41.92 Yeah, I'll just put it in the question bank
00:03:41.92 --> 00:03:46.64 And would you ever consider getting someone to do it for you?
00:03:47.60 --> 00:03:53.52 No, like not answer, but like take it all in record it like so you don't have to check yourself
00:03:54.40 --> 00:03:58.32 Maybe I guess that seems like something Tim Ferriss would tell me to do
00:03:58.88 --> 00:04:06.88 Which is we just smart. I tell you to hire a kid and pack a stand-in-put for eight bucks an hour right no, and maybe that's a smart thing to do the problem I find with that is
00:04:08.08 --> 00:04:08.72 I
00:04:08.72 --> 00:04:13.76 Wouldn't if I was want to talk to me and I was one of the troopers out there. I'd want I'd rather have
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000 Take the chances of
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000 Not hearing anything back from me
00:04:18.16 --> 00:04:21.60 But know that the guy that actually read this thing was me. Oh
00:04:21.76 --> 00:04:26.76 I'm 100% with you. I've had people tell me to hand my stuff over and I'm like, uh-uh
00:04:27.12 --> 00:04:31.24 Because that's me. Yeah, there is one reason why I interact with Jaco on Twitter
00:04:31.24 --> 00:04:35.76 It's because I know it's Jaco. Yeah, and I think that's the feeling most people would have
00:04:35.76 --> 00:04:40.64 I know I would have it guess who you unfa-guess who I unfollow on Twitter when I realize oh that's not
00:04:41.12 --> 00:04:44.72 That's not him or her. Oh, okay, so never mind yeah
00:04:46.16 --> 00:04:50.16 For me, it's like if you're in a leadership position and you
00:04:52.08 --> 00:04:54.40 Lead you send someone else to do your bidding
00:04:55.36 --> 00:04:59.12 That's to me is not good and I wouldn't like that if I was a
00:04:59.60 --> 00:05:05.68 Follow-where yeah, yeah, well that yeah, to the whole point to social media and the other thing is I get a lot of
00:05:05.68 --> 00:05:11.52 You know good feedback from people and also people always like oh you inspire me and you know
00:05:11.52 --> 00:05:13.28 I say you inspire me too
00:05:13.76 --> 00:05:15.20 Because there's people that are out there
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.16 Grinding it out in their worlds in their lives and I say man
00:05:20.56 --> 00:05:24.72 The world is fooled with a bunch of people not a bunch of lazy slackers that I'm used to
00:05:25.04 --> 00:05:29.84 You get on the you get on the Twitter the the Jaco troopers man they're getting after it all of them
00:05:29.84 --> 00:05:32.80 Yeah, charging yeah, they're not getting on there and saying hey
00:05:32.80 --> 00:05:36.16 I don't feel like I'm gonna get after it today. I think I'm gonna say no
00:05:36.16 --> 00:05:42.72 They're like it's 407 and I'm in the game and I go damn I gotta keep my game in check
00:05:42.72 --> 00:05:46.16 Yeah, I love I love it when I see like I'll see
00:05:46.72 --> 00:05:52.40 You're because you always put the picture of your watch when you wake up. Yes, I do and then I'll see like a retweet with like
00:05:52.40 --> 00:05:57.92 You know somebody else was watching there's like a thousand watches with like your picture and the air is right next to it
00:05:57.92 --> 00:06:00.64 And I'm like oh, it's six a.m. All right. I'm all look at that
00:06:00.64 --> 00:06:06.000 I love you man, but I ain't getting up at four. Yeah, that's just me. Yeah, I don't have any legs
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.72 So I gotta excuse cool right. I don't accept but
00:06:10.56 --> 00:06:12.32 But it's I feel the same because it's like
00:06:14.16 --> 00:06:19.92 It's it's a duty now. Yeah, we've put ourselves in a position where others turn to us
00:06:20.72 --> 00:06:24.24 So now we got to turn to them and if we don't show up
00:06:25.04 --> 00:06:30.000 Oh, who we letting down? I'm not it's not that I'm letting me down. Yeah, you know it's that you're gonna let down all
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.96 What do you got like 25,000 Twitter followers or something?

00:06:50.88 --> 00:06:56.48 Last thing I want to do is put those things on today and then I'll think about everybody else that is in my position
00:06:56.48 --> 00:07:01.84 And says and I get it because I get the same thing right all hey man thanks for being who you are and

00:08:45.68 --> 00:08:50.72 Something great because I'm not man. I'm not I'm a I'm a
00:08:52.24 --> 00:08:56.88 Weekend soft and do stupid things you know, I mean don't put me on a pedestal

00:09:03.36 --> 00:09:09.36 Your self don't worry about me springboard off my back and go to a higher level
00:09:09.36 --> 00:09:13.04 That's what I want to see happen that's what I don't want I don't want people to put me on a pedestal
00:09:13.04 --> 00:09:17.36 I want them to stand on my shoulders and go higher and further than anything I could ever do
00:09:17.92 --> 00:09:24.24 That's what I like did it take you this is a personal question on my end to take you while to say
00:09:25.68 --> 00:09:30.64 Like when somebody would say you inspire me and and thank you for being who you are
00:09:31.60 --> 00:09:35.36 Did you accept that at first or did you have to tell them like don't know no
00:09:36.64 --> 00:09:38.64 Like you just said like I'm nothing special
00:09:38.64 --> 00:09:43.76 But how long did take you before you would accept that compliment without without dismissing it
00:09:43.76 --> 00:09:46.40 I literally went right the first person that said that to me
00:09:46.40 --> 00:09:49.44 I said no man you inspire me you know because
00:09:50.16 --> 00:09:54.000 Your I guess what I've had a great life. I've had a great life and I'm
00:09:54.96 --> 00:10:00.80 Stoked right but look at you you're saying I inspire you look you inspire me you're a single mom
00:10:01.76 --> 00:10:07.36 With two or three jobs getting after it and by getting after I mean waiting tables
00:10:07.36 --> 00:10:18.32 Working in as an admin assistant and then doing some babysitting at night yeah and helping with homework and making lunches and and and and all right
00:10:18.32 --> 00:10:21.76 So jocos really really no actually you are yeah
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.24 You're fired up. Yeah, I just I asked because it took me a while because I I had a real hard time
00:10:29.04 --> 00:10:34.08 With people looking at me like that and I actually would I would be like dismissive of it at first
00:10:34.08 --> 00:10:39.44 I'd be like not off what are you doing what are you talking about it? I'm just I'm nobody special like don't don't don't say that
00:10:39.92 --> 00:10:41.92 and I realize I was
00:10:42.32 --> 00:10:44.32 Be in a bit of a dick
00:10:44.96 --> 00:10:47.20 By completely dismissing their
00:10:47.60 --> 00:10:54.72 Feelings for for for the situation and and then it was until I until I realized though and then that's when I realized
00:10:54.72 --> 00:10:58.72 I went oh this is this is real these people actually do feel this and I'm
00:10:59.44 --> 00:11:01.44 Who am I to dismiss their feelings?
00:11:01.68 --> 00:11:02.72 You know
00:11:02.72 --> 00:11:08.80 I tried trying to use them to be stronger and realize like you know like this is real like people are looking up to me
00:11:08.80 --> 00:11:14.08 So now I got to live up to that role. I'll tell you another thing that I tell people when they say something like that to me
00:11:14.88 --> 00:11:20.88 I tell them look there's many people that have done way more than me and sacrificed way more than me 100% and
00:11:22.40 --> 00:11:24.000 The fact that
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.80 You think that about me the only reason you think that about me is because you know me
00:11:28.80 --> 00:11:35.52 You know who I am because I stepped out of the darkness and and into the public view yeah
00:11:35.92 --> 00:11:38.32 But otherwise there's a bunch of
00:11:39.84 --> 00:11:41.84 A bunch of warriors
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.84 That they're never gonna know their name
00:11:44.40 --> 00:11:49.92 They're never gonna be able to say hey you inspire me so there's told in that my direction and I tell them look
00:11:50.32 --> 00:11:54.96 You don't I don't inspire you you get inspired by what I stand for and what I represent
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.80 Is
00:11:56.80 --> 00:12:06.48 Thousands and thousands of serviceman seals yes soldiers yes Marines yes all of them yeah, yeah, that's what that's what you're saying and
00:12:07.52 --> 00:12:09.52 And so on behalf of all of them
00:12:10.80 --> 00:12:17.68 I get it because you know what those soldiers those Marines those seals those guys in special operations
00:12:17.68 --> 00:12:26.40 They inspire me too and so I think there's that's kind of the so it's a given take yeah, okay
00:12:26.40 --> 00:12:31.68 Yeah, no I had to ask you because I went through such a with with the legs and everything
00:12:31.68 --> 00:12:37.04 I was just trying to accept not having legs never mind that I had a woman come up to me and say
00:12:37.60 --> 00:12:43.92 I had like I had several actually, but this this was like maybe the first I think she said I lost a hundred pounds because of you
00:12:43.92 --> 00:12:49.20 Yeah, and I'm like first of all you don't even look like you weigh a hundred pounds and I'm like huh
00:12:51.28 --> 00:12:56.88 What did I do? I'm just being me and and that was the one that really in my mind like at that moment
00:12:56.88 --> 00:13:03.12 I went okay, I got I got a I got a reevaluate what's going on here. Yeah, I can't just dismiss this as I'm just
00:13:03.12 --> 00:13:04.32 Jody Middick anymore
00:13:04.32 --> 00:13:09.28 Clearly clearly there's something going on well I think your story in particular strikes are real
00:13:09.28 --> 00:13:15.68 Cored with people because you had to overcome some crazy adversity and by the way
00:13:16.40 --> 00:13:20.000 Your adversity while challenging as you know well
00:13:20.32 --> 00:13:23.20 There's guys with much more challenging adversity than you've had
00:13:23.76 --> 00:13:26.96 10 fold a hundred fold and so
00:13:27.76 --> 00:13:31.36 You know for me it's a joke for you you at least get a sense
00:13:31.92 --> 00:13:35.92 But you and me both know and we've seen guys and we know guys that have had it
00:13:35.92 --> 00:13:42.96 Like I said infinitely worse than you kind of imaginable unimaginable and so those guys
00:13:43.68 --> 00:13:47.04 That get up with their issues and press on and drive on
00:13:48.08 --> 00:13:53.60 Look to them for inspiration. Absolutely. Look right past me look right past Jody look at those guys
00:13:53.76 --> 00:14:00.72 Who are doing what they're doing and and that to me is is where inspiration comes from and so I guess
00:14:00.72 --> 00:14:08.08 Inspiration's around you everywhere. Yeah, it really is if you open your eyes to it and you look at what other human beings do
00:14:08.80 --> 00:14:14.000 It's it's amazing. Yeah, it's amazing. Yeah, I love I love it. I love humans humans are such
00:14:14.72 --> 00:14:17.68 We're such a species that's study, you know like
00:14:18.72 --> 00:14:23.92 So anyway, I know we wanted to get to the inner webs, but I wanted to have that discussion with you before we moved on because
00:14:25.60 --> 00:14:30.16 It was just important to me to hear that the discussion. Yeah has been had Roger
00:14:30.16 --> 00:14:35.68 And I think it's yeah, I think it's I think it's awesome. I think it's awesome and
00:14:37.68 --> 00:14:42.32 Yeah, like I said, I see why people are coming up and telling you that yeah, I agree with them actually
00:14:42.88 --> 00:14:44.88 Well, thanks, buddy
00:14:44.88 --> 00:14:46.88 All right, make me blush
00:14:47.44 --> 00:14:51.52 We need to get some questions from the intro webs now. Okay now get it right here we go
00:14:52.80 --> 00:14:53.76 Okay
00:14:53.76 --> 00:14:59.84 Mental exercises to learn to control once pulse and breathing in really stressful situations or
00:14:59.84 --> 00:15:02.24 When very nervous what do you do?
00:15:04.40 --> 00:15:07.44 Mental exercises, so we touched on this very
00:15:08.24 --> 00:15:12.08 Briefly in the last episode which was
00:15:13.92 --> 00:15:16.24 On the book and where I talk a little bit about
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000 Snape training
00:15:21.20 --> 00:15:26.40 Visualization is probably your biggest tool and what in my experience
00:15:26.40 --> 00:15:32.96 Train train the shit out of it train train train and when you think you've trained enough keep training
00:15:33.44 --> 00:15:36.16 But when you're not training think about it
00:15:37.84 --> 00:15:40.80 Think about it the more you think about it become
00:15:42.08 --> 00:15:46.08 In tune with yourself. Okay, I'm gonna get a little spacey here little earthy
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000 Just sit there
00:15:51.12 --> 00:15:53.12 Because you know what you do when you're a sniper
00:15:53.12 --> 00:15:57.12 You're fucking sit there you have a lot of time to yourself
00:15:57.68 --> 00:16:02.64 Can't really talk because you got a job to do and what you gotta do is you just gotta
00:16:07.52 --> 00:16:09.68 Okay, I know my heart rate's gonna go up here
00:16:10.24 --> 00:16:17.52 But I do my best to make sure it doesn't overwhelm my motor functions and you can control it pretty
00:16:17.52 --> 00:16:24.88 meant that pretty easily if you prepare yourself for that moment but it's all about preparation training and visualization
00:16:26.80 --> 00:16:28.80 Even like
00:16:29.04 --> 00:16:33.36 Even making the shot you know like Tim Kennedy was on here, right? And he talked about dry firing
00:16:34.88 --> 00:16:36.88 Consider dry firing
00:16:37.44 --> 00:16:44.16 That this is your dry firing for for for controlling yourself for your brain for your brain exactly and
00:16:44.16 --> 00:16:50.96 Dry fire you brain I like that and and um it only comes from experience now
00:16:50.96 --> 00:16:55.20 I guess there's probably some exceptions the rule out there that are just born to be
00:16:55.68 --> 00:16:58.56 Cold blooded killers that second they get behind a barrel but
00:16:59.36 --> 00:17:03.28 But for me it was it was visualization and just preparing
00:17:04.08 --> 00:17:09.04 To accept the feelings that were coming and also overriding them
00:17:09.04 --> 00:17:14.96 Because they could still be happening but you can still control yourself with the right kind of preparation
00:17:15.92 --> 00:17:17.92 And it's also a perishable skill funny enough
00:17:18.80 --> 00:17:20.80 I realized
00:17:21.60 --> 00:17:26.56 I don't know if that answered the question but I think that's I think that's good and I think for me
00:17:28.32 --> 00:17:31.84 One thing that I that I know I do and this is a
00:17:33.12 --> 00:17:35.12 I guess it's it may be considered a technique
00:17:35.12 --> 00:17:39.76 But it's like the technique creates the solution
00:17:40.16 --> 00:17:44.32 Let me explain this to you one of the things that I do in stressful situations
00:17:44.96 --> 00:17:49.52 There's something that I always try and do and that is no matter what's going on
00:17:50.24 --> 00:17:52.24 I try and
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000 Remain calm in my voice
00:17:54.40 --> 00:17:56.40 So when things are going crazy
00:17:56.96 --> 00:18:00.48 I try and get on the radio and say a we need two more people over here
00:18:00.48 --> 00:18:07.12 Not hey we need two more people over here Roger that so if you're gonna talk in a calm controlled voice
00:18:08.40 --> 00:18:12.64 Then you can't be breathing hard you can't be excited you can't
00:18:13.44 --> 00:18:17.04 Get angry you can't get frustrated you have to lock all that up
00:18:18.24 --> 00:18:20.88 And get it under control before you open your lips
00:18:21.68 --> 00:18:23.68 Right and start saying something
00:18:23.68 --> 00:18:31.44 And so I'm always very focused on I am gonna sound calm cool and collected when I open my mouth
00:18:32.16 --> 00:18:37.76 That way and when in doing that the only way to make that happen is to do everything we just talked about
00:18:38.08 --> 00:18:43.84 Control your breathing control your pulse control your emotions get all those things under control and then say
00:18:44.48 --> 00:18:47.12 All right, we need two more guys down here immediately now
00:18:48.96 --> 00:18:50.96 And everybody goes oh, okay
00:18:51.20 --> 00:18:53.20 Let's make this happen and
00:18:53.20 --> 00:18:57.76 Coming from you especially you're in your in your case you're the boss
00:18:58.72 --> 00:19:03.12 So if you're if you're calm cool and collected that translates to your troopers
00:19:03.36 --> 00:19:07.92 It absolutely right us when we wouldn't and it would for us as well when we were doing Overwatch
00:19:08.56 --> 00:19:11.84 You know six to six three you move into your left
00:19:12.24 --> 00:19:17.36 Well, no no no no you're left right think about what happens when you do that so imagine if I went
00:19:17.36 --> 00:19:23.20 Who should six there on your left or on your left right I'm freaking out they would even it all would be lost
00:19:23.20 --> 00:19:27.12 But you're that you're that voice because we're over snipers are overwatch
00:19:27.28 --> 00:19:31.84 We're they the troops feel better when they know okay the snipers do you know watch okay?
00:19:31.84 --> 00:19:34.80 We can we're gonna be okay. So if I go on the radio and talk
00:19:35.68 --> 00:19:40.24 the same way so you know, no, okay yet adjust fire 400 meters north
00:19:40.96 --> 00:19:42.48 You know fire for effect
00:19:42.48 --> 00:19:45.60 Roger that you know they got a that's a good point. I didn't thought of that
00:19:45.60 --> 00:19:50.64 Yeah, I think airline pilots train that too because you know we hit the turret reliance and they're oh
00:19:50.64 --> 00:19:52.64 Hey, I'm sorry about that
00:19:52.64 --> 00:19:59.28 That's you know yeah, just go ahead and put your seat and yeah, yeah, yeah, actually if you hear solely the guy that landed on the
00:19:59.84 --> 00:20:02.96 He's like that yeah, yeah, we're gonna have to read that
00:20:02.96 --> 00:20:08.96 They have to teach him that because that's where people are so apprehensive before they're in the play
00:20:08.96 --> 00:20:14.32 My favorite part about that is uh, like yeah, we'll be in the river and the guys like say again
00:20:14.32 --> 00:20:20.08 We'll be in the Hudson Roger out and like the plane. It's like real time you're watching the video and he's just like yeah
00:20:20.08 --> 00:20:22.08 Yeah, we're in the river. We're in the river
00:20:22.08 --> 00:20:24.08 That's the home man. What?
00:20:24.88 --> 00:20:26.08 If I controlling you
00:20:26.08 --> 00:20:31.20 You know order to control his voice. He's got a control his breathing. He's got a control his temper. He's got a control his emotions and so
00:20:31.60 --> 00:20:37.12 That's what I do in those situations. I don't say what if I haven't if I don't if I'm not the situation
00:20:37.12 --> 00:20:39.12 Where I need to talk I'll just talk to myself
00:20:39.12 --> 00:20:44.24 Be like okay, you know just say that in my head. Yeah, all right. What is the next movement? You're gonna?
00:20:44.24 --> 00:20:48.08 I know we're spending a lot of time on the first question, but that's what saved my life. Oh
00:20:49.60 --> 00:20:51.60 staying
00:20:51.92 --> 00:20:58.40 If I had gone into shock to you that'd be dead right and I say it in the book I say I did my best to go into the zone
00:21:00.16 --> 00:21:03.76 So I know I'm bleeding it and I know this and I know that but
00:21:03.76 --> 00:21:07.68 And my mind it was let the system do its job
00:21:09.92 --> 00:21:15.92 Okay, everything's gonna be fine jodied. It's okay. And I just I just kept saying talking to myself
00:21:16.48 --> 00:21:23.04 Visualizing what okay, so the chopper's gonna come in you know and I just visualized each step and my my
00:21:23.04 --> 00:21:29.76 But the whole point to it was I couldn't have my pulse, you know, jackhammer otherwise more blood's lost more blood
00:21:29.76 --> 00:21:34.08 And then your and what happens right blood gets sucked into your core when you go into shock and
00:21:34.72 --> 00:21:39.60 And that sucks it out of your brain sucks it out of everywhere where you know, I need to stay conscious
00:21:39.60 --> 00:21:41.04 So
00:21:41.04 --> 00:21:46.40 No anyway long long answer for one question, but this this is also something you know you gotta learn
00:21:46.96 --> 00:21:52.08 Practice keep practicing it you'll figure it yeah and always and we talk about this again all the time on the podcast
00:21:52.48 --> 00:21:55.84 Anoculate yourself to these stressful situations. That's right. That's a great. That's a great
00:21:55.84 --> 00:22:01.68 Grossman. That's the guy's name. Yes, but stress inoculation. Yep, anoculate yourself to the stress
00:22:02.24 --> 00:22:06.000 So that when you you get used to it. Yeah, the more stressful such I mean
00:22:06.56 --> 00:22:11.52 Training going through training man. They they put all kinds of stresses at you. Yeah, so that you learn to deal with it
00:22:11.76 --> 00:22:14.56 And if you want to learn how that's your time to practice
00:22:15.20 --> 00:22:21.44 Controlling all those things absolutely and I'm not trying to go level seven Zen Buddha on you all like
00:22:21.44 --> 00:22:26.64 You need to get into the mindset to control your breathing like no it's a practical thing. It's a real thing
00:22:26.64 --> 00:22:30.96 It's not a yoga thing. It's a practical real thing of hey
00:22:31.44 --> 00:22:38.24 Get calm down. Yeah, take a deep breath get yourself under control now. It's time to talk and give clear concise orders that calm
00:22:38.24 --> 00:22:44.32 Yeah, or make that shot or crack one off if you're in the sniper zone lack a bad guy
00:22:46.96 --> 00:22:48.96 All right
00:22:48.96 --> 00:22:50.96 Next question
00:22:52.08 --> 00:22:55.44 What does Jodie think of the soldier first principle
00:22:56.80 --> 00:23:02.64 In the Canadian armed forces is expertise such as his being lost due to this
00:23:04.08 --> 00:23:06.24 I think they're talking about the
00:23:07.76 --> 00:23:09.76 Universityality of service which means
00:23:12.08 --> 00:23:13.76 Everyone must be able to deploy
00:23:14.80 --> 00:23:16.80 so
00:23:16.80 --> 00:23:18.80 I didn't realize what it meant
00:23:19.92 --> 00:23:24.000 until I lost my feet and instead and my mind
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.84 You know, this was something else. Okay. I can't deploy anymore, but I can go to the sniper school and teach the next generation of snipers
00:23:31.28 --> 00:23:35.20 Sure, but you're not gonna get promoted and listen that no, you know like huh?
00:23:35.76 --> 00:23:38.64 I was supposed to get promoted to surgeon like what do we talk about here?
00:23:39.68 --> 00:23:44.96 So University of service says if you are not deployable you're not employable
00:23:44.96 --> 00:23:48.80 And you can't be promoted and you can't get any courses in this that you know
00:23:50.32 --> 00:23:56.24 So because of it we lose a lot of corporate knowledge, right? So I would like I said I was what we call a master sniper
00:23:56.48 --> 00:23:59.68 Advanced sniper and that doesn't mean I get access to the
00:24:00.88 --> 00:24:02.88 Canadian temple of sniper
00:24:03.68 --> 00:24:09.44 Snuperdom to see the secret 13th scroll or anything it just means I'm allowed to do the paper work and hand out qualifications
00:24:09.44 --> 00:24:16.24 And stuff like that. Now it is a very difficult qualification to achieve and they spend a lot of money getting me there
00:24:17.44 --> 00:24:25.60 And that value is completely erased with my injuries. So soldier first is if you're not deployable get
00:24:26.48 --> 00:24:33.92 Then you're gonna you're unavailable. Okay, so under that system you get however many years to recover from whatever your injury is
00:24:33.92 --> 00:24:41.92 At that point if you're not recovering or going to recover they will then begin the process to release you from the example
00:24:45.92 --> 00:24:47.92 They're convinced that it's
00:24:48.64 --> 00:24:53.52 Required because of the size of our military where my take is
00:24:54.40 --> 00:24:56.40 I believe at the opposite
00:24:56.40 --> 00:25:02.08 Because of the size of our military you want guys like me doing the training the guys with the experience
00:25:02.08 --> 00:25:06.72 The guys who want to be there to train the guys and can't deploy
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.04 For as long as possible now I'm not saying put me in a spot leave me there for 15 years to become a dinosaur
00:25:14.56 --> 00:25:23.44 But allow me to pass on the knowledge I have and and remain useful right but but they and they say you can
00:25:23.76 --> 00:25:28.32 For the for the limited number of years and they they offer these things that they call extensions in that
00:25:28.32 --> 00:25:33.76 We're not gonna get promoted so forget about a better pension you're not gonna do this and you're not gonna do that
00:25:35.76 --> 00:25:37.76 And the dichotomy
00:25:38.72 --> 00:25:44.32 As the word that I I never used to use that word as much I used it I was one of the few people use it
00:25:44.32 --> 00:25:47.28 But not nearly as much as since I started listening to the jocco podcast
00:25:48.96 --> 00:25:50.96 The dichotomy of it is that
00:25:52.80 --> 00:25:56.72 We are version of the Pentagon. I'm gonna get a lot of trouble for saying this but
00:25:56.72 --> 00:26:00.000 Is a whole lot of people who's
00:26:00.80 --> 00:26:06.72 Physical fitness probably keeps them from being able to do anything and they're not being they're not getting they're not
00:26:06.72 --> 00:26:08.72 He's suited no and
00:26:09.84 --> 00:26:11.84 It's one of those like open secrets
00:26:13.12 --> 00:26:19.36 You know I'm saying yeah and and I'm sorry if people get mad at me for that and stuff but
00:26:19.36 --> 00:26:28.24 I'm willing to run half marathons and and and do cross fit without legs and stuff like that and you still don't want to promote me or keep me
00:26:28.24 --> 00:26:32.000 Well, I'm gonna point out a few issues with your system and I
00:26:32.88 --> 00:26:38.88 Don't blame the military right like a military is a system like we said the big green machine a roll on with her without you
00:26:39.52 --> 00:26:41.52 At some point you got to worry about you
00:26:42.08 --> 00:26:45.36 And that's at some point I just started worrying about more about me than about
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.24 Then about mommy the big mommy military
00:26:48.24 --> 00:26:52.96 And but then I you know when I look back over my shoulder every now and then I go
00:26:54.16 --> 00:26:56.16 Tell me that guy over there's deploying
00:26:56.96 --> 00:26:59.92 Show me what show me his med med. How many pull ups can he do?
00:27:01.28 --> 00:27:03.28 And so anyway it's um
00:27:03.60 --> 00:27:07.20 I believe it I'm sure someone somewhere thinks it's a good idea
00:27:07.20 --> 00:27:10.16 But I think the millet the Canadian forces should re-examine
00:27:11.04 --> 00:27:13.04 What it actually means
00:27:13.04 --> 00:27:16.72 Because it's very black and white yeah, that's and there's no room for
00:27:16.72 --> 00:27:20.64 Um, oh well, okay, so here's an example real quick example we can move on
00:27:21.36 --> 00:27:24.32 We used to have um, we're in no rush joty
00:27:25.20 --> 00:27:28.08 We used to have a thing we called acting lacking
00:27:28.96 --> 00:27:38.32 So you were acting as surgeon lacking qualification and it would be a way to like promote guys that maybe can't quite get you know
00:27:38.32 --> 00:27:45.68 Maybe they have an injury or something and um and they got rid of it as we went back into combat
00:27:46.72 --> 00:27:50.80 Basically yeah, so you had all these guys getting smashed in combat
00:27:51.76 --> 00:27:56.72 Now getting told like yeah, we can't make an exception until you can't get promote so I was one of them
00:27:57.44 --> 00:28:01.84 I was on the cusp of being promoted surgeon just had to come home and do
00:28:02.32 --> 00:28:06.80 What we call it's called a small arms course and it makes you an expert in all small arms in the infantry
00:28:06.80 --> 00:28:09.84 And how to train with them to train troopers and
00:28:10.80 --> 00:28:15.20 Then you get promoted surgeon and when you learn some surgeon leadership stuff as well, but
00:28:15.76 --> 00:28:19.20 I was number one of my regimen to go do it and
00:28:20.24 --> 00:28:23.44 When I got after I got wounded they're like yeah, sorry man
00:28:23.44 --> 00:28:28.72 I'm like, well, can I just be acting lacking so my pension is better like oh, yeah, we don't do that anymore
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.72 Yeah, that's I can see why I mean we're only in combat guys are getting smashed all the time
00:28:34.72 --> 00:28:37.52 So why would you want to promote them and you know like
00:28:39.04 --> 00:28:41.68 The administrative side of the military can be very
00:28:42.40 --> 00:28:46.40 Heartless sometimes yeah, and I remember when I was in San Antonio
00:28:47.04 --> 00:28:50.56 Telling this to some medical colonel and she was like
00:28:51.28 --> 00:28:54.000 Huh, she's like I promoted a guy who's in a coma the other day
00:28:54.88 --> 00:28:59.44 We don't we don't give a shit down here no if you if we think you deserve it you get your promotion
00:28:59.44 --> 00:29:05.60 Because we know it makes things better for you when you get out so
00:29:06.48 --> 00:29:08.48 Should I be
00:29:08.56 --> 00:29:12.96 Better about not getting promoted? No, I'm I'm over it, but I'm better you didn't get promoted
00:29:12.96 --> 00:29:18.48 How you like that apples. Yeah, thank you, but you know at the same time there's a lot of amazing people and a lot of
00:29:19.52 --> 00:29:21.92 Difficult spots and of leadership and
00:29:22.64 --> 00:29:26.08 You know you got to pick your battles, too. Yeah, right. So anyway
00:29:26.48 --> 00:29:28.48 well, I'll tell you
00:29:28.48 --> 00:29:30.48 As you pointed out, yeah, I
00:29:30.48 --> 00:29:35.84 That's really good what you said about the guys getting promoted that in a coma. That's awesome. I can't speak to the whole military
00:29:36.32 --> 00:29:41.84 I can say in the sealed teams we did a we do an outstanding job of taking guys that get wounded and
00:29:42.32 --> 00:29:47.12 As a matter of fact one of my guys who was wounded real bad Ryan Joe who was
00:29:48.24 --> 00:29:49.20 Awesome
00:29:49.20 --> 00:29:50.56 Biggles
00:29:50.56 --> 00:29:53.60 Then he got shot in the face got blinded and
00:29:53.60 --> 00:30:00.48 He was like I'm staying in and he's telling me I'm staying in and he wanted to come back to Iraq
00:30:01.04 --> 00:30:04.08 When he before he found out he's buying there was blind. He still wanted to come back
00:30:05.76 --> 00:30:07.36 But um
00:30:07.36 --> 00:30:09.84 Then like when we came home from deployment everything
00:30:11.44 --> 00:30:14.08 And you know he's he's blind
00:30:15.20 --> 00:30:18.72 And he says yeah, I want to stay in the teams and I talked I was
00:30:18.72 --> 00:30:23.84 I was friends with the Admiral that wasn't charge of all the seals nice and hasty or
00:30:24.72 --> 00:30:27.28 I know this might sound crazy, but you know Ryan Joe
00:30:27.68 --> 00:30:31.84 He wants to stay in the teams and just keep being a team guy
00:30:32.64 --> 00:30:34.64 He's like we'll find a job for him
00:30:35.12 --> 00:30:36.16 Right
00:30:36.16 --> 00:30:39.84 Which is awesome was it is awesome, but was he gonna get promoted?
00:30:40.24 --> 00:30:43.20 He would have yeah, he would have just they would have put found a job for him and
00:30:43.20 --> 00:30:47.84 He actually ended up saying you know what kind of became the same conclusion that you made
00:30:47.84 --> 00:30:48.88 Yeah, which is like you know what?
00:30:49.92 --> 00:30:54.96 I can't do like the actual job of being a seal now he had tons of lessons he could have passed on
00:30:55.68 --> 00:30:56.96 Which would have been awesome
00:30:57.84 --> 00:31:03.52 But he he made a decision hey, you know what I'm gonna move on okay and so he got out so what would have happened
00:31:03.92 --> 00:31:07.52 No, there's he he was stayed in and I would hope
00:31:08.32 --> 00:31:12.24 You know that was one admiral who was a great guy who had a great attitude and supporting
00:31:12.24 --> 00:31:17.28 In supporting the teas and that's one thing that that admiral always said to me
00:31:17.28 --> 00:31:22.40 This is an admiral I worked for for about 13 months. I was the aid to the admiral in charge of all the seals
00:31:22.88 --> 00:31:24.88 Outstanding guy, but
00:31:24.88 --> 00:31:30.32 One of the things that he would say during meetings and you know he did all these politicians that you're talking about all these
00:31:30.64 --> 00:31:34.24 Administrative people that you're talking about all the big bureaucracy that you're talking about
00:31:34.72 --> 00:31:38.88 And he would see what ask them they'd go through their big presentation about we're gonna cut this we're gonna do that
00:31:38.88 --> 00:31:44.64 We're gonna buy this but we're not gonna buy that and he'd say how does this affect the potunes?
00:31:46.96 --> 00:31:48.24 Oh
00:31:48.24 --> 00:31:54.000 Like because because people would forget that the whole reason you're there the whole reason any of that infrastructure
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.44 Anything is there is how does it support the potunes?
00:31:57.84 --> 00:32:00.72 How does it help the seals? How does it help the machine gunner?
00:32:00.88 --> 00:32:05.92 How does it help the sniper out there or the radio men the guys that are actually doing the job that we have
00:32:05.92 --> 00:32:11.28 And I say this to businesses sometimes when I work with businesses and I see that there are
00:32:11.68 --> 00:32:15.20 Infrastructures getting super big and they're starting to impose
00:32:16.08 --> 00:32:22.72 Plans and restrictions and I say hey remember what you're here for you're here to support this guy
00:32:23.20 --> 00:32:29.60 That's on the manufacturing floor or this guy that's out there selling or this this woman that's working with the patients or whatever
00:32:29.60 --> 00:32:31.84 Business it is because it's very easy
00:32:31.84 --> 00:32:37.60 To be in a leadership position and forget about what the ground troops are doing
00:32:38.24 --> 00:32:40.40 No dead and that's a horrible thing
00:32:40.96 --> 00:32:43.12 That's a horrible thing and this thing that you're talking about
00:32:43.68 --> 00:32:47.52 Soldier first which sounds to me like soldier last because they don't want to take care of the soldiers
00:32:47.52 --> 00:32:54.56 Because they want to do that because there's nobody better to prepare soldiers for combat and soldiers that are bidding combat
00:32:54.96 --> 00:32:59.20 Yeah, if I want to learn sniper you know how I want to learn it from in Canada
00:32:59.20 --> 00:33:04.16 Jody medic you know I want to learn it from someone that's like you if I want to learn how to patrol
00:33:04.16 --> 00:33:09.76 I want to learn it from someone like you I don't want to learn it from a guy that theoretically understands it
00:33:09.84 --> 00:33:13.12 Right, that's not the same thing. I want the real deal
00:33:14.56 --> 00:33:20.24 Yeah, it's it's a policy again. They defend it. They think it's necessary
00:33:22.32 --> 00:33:23.60 What are you gonna do?
00:33:23.60 --> 00:33:25.60 Yeah big green machine just keeps on
00:33:25.60 --> 00:33:27.60 All right
00:33:29.36 --> 00:33:33.84 This is a similar question to when we've already had but I'm gonna do it again
00:33:35.44 --> 00:33:41.84 How do you silence distraction no matter how important to achieve your number one priority?
00:33:46.80 --> 00:33:48.80 On on op
00:33:49.12 --> 00:33:52.80 When I was still a sniper I actually had a much easier time of this
00:33:52.80 --> 00:33:54.80 I'm I'm
00:33:55.92 --> 00:33:57.92 I made ed in a lot of ways and
00:34:00.48 --> 00:34:07.68 Whatever I want to focus on ADD doesn't mean that you can't focus on stuff it just means like when the teacher tells you to focus on something
00:34:07.68 --> 00:34:09.68 You're busy doing other stuff and so
00:34:11.76 --> 00:34:16.48 Right it's not a deficit disorder. It's that I don't give a shit what you're trying to show me
00:34:16.72 --> 00:34:19.68 But that right there that's what I want to look at so
00:34:19.68 --> 00:34:21.68 I
00:34:21.68 --> 00:34:23.68 I had a way of just
00:34:24.08 --> 00:34:26.08 I would like if I had to watch a cross road
00:34:26.80 --> 00:34:28.08 I watched that
00:34:28.08 --> 00:34:30.08 Crossroad was my whole
00:34:30.48 --> 00:34:34.24 World and it wouldn't matter what was now it doesn't mean I was in situationally aware
00:34:35.68 --> 00:34:41.68 But I would watch that cross road like my my life dependent on it are somebody's life dependent on it
00:34:42.48 --> 00:34:45.52 Which which a lot of times it did and
00:34:45.52 --> 00:34:50.80 um if I have a nut what I found actually and this is one of the reasons why
00:34:51.84 --> 00:34:55.04 I'm starting to meditate again. I'm seeing a therapist again
00:34:55.84 --> 00:34:57.84 I'm listening to
00:34:57.84 --> 00:35:00.48 Jocco podcast and reading extreme ownership
00:35:01.60 --> 00:35:03.60 No, I'm saying serious. That's awesome. Is that
00:35:04.80 --> 00:35:10.16 In my civilian post military post wounded post addiction
00:35:10.16 --> 00:35:12.16 and
00:35:13.52 --> 00:35:19.20 Phase world I've I've lost a little bit of my ability to to to to
00:35:19.92 --> 00:35:22.32 Push out the input I don't want
00:35:23.76 --> 00:35:30.96 I have a hard I used to read a book a month at the at the minimum and I'm gonna talk in like a book
00:35:32.32 --> 00:35:34.72 You know that I showed you I had the 33 laws of war
00:35:34.72 --> 00:35:39.92 In my suitcase. I've been reading that for three months and I'm maybe half done
00:35:40.80 --> 00:35:42.80 I have a real hard time now
00:35:45.36 --> 00:35:51.92 Achieving that that zone of zero distraction and I'm trying to get it back because
00:35:53.04 --> 00:36:01.60 It's really I get a lot done. You know I have I have my my politics. I have the book. I do keynote speeches
00:36:01.60 --> 00:36:03.60 I have my kids
00:36:04.80 --> 00:36:10.16 I have all my hobbies, you know, I'm I'm trying to support veterans support charities that support veterans
00:36:11.20 --> 00:36:16.64 And I still get a lot done but I could get so much more done if I could turn off
00:36:17.84 --> 00:36:23.36 Some things in my mind sometimes and I don't know what what's happened or what if this is what an ad
00:36:23.36 --> 00:36:28.72 X-brain is like now or if it's just I'm always seeking something I get bored easily
00:36:28.72 --> 00:36:34.08 That's part of the EDD. I've always had that but when I found something and latched on to it
00:36:34.88 --> 00:36:37.92 I used to be like just I was 100%
00:36:38.96 --> 00:36:44.80 Focused until I became you know I got as much of that as I could and then I would move on to the next thing and
00:36:48.08 --> 00:36:50.08 Yeah, I got to be honest. I've
00:36:50.08 --> 00:36:58.32 Visualization though going back to the first question is one way that you can do it and I've started meditating
00:36:59.12 --> 00:37:01.12 to get my mind back
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.92 Into that state. I used to do a lot of yoga and I used to do a lot of mindfulness
00:37:07.36 --> 00:37:12.16 Not training. I don't know what people could now it's called mindfulness training back then. I think it was just called
00:37:12.80 --> 00:37:15.28 Reflection or something. I call it G. J. too
00:37:15.28 --> 00:37:21.36 Yeah, well when I'm done the bodybuilding show and November I will start your jitz
00:37:21.36 --> 00:37:23.92 Oh, you might actually be starting jjitsu tomorrow
00:37:24.24 --> 00:37:26.24 My bro just don't hurt me
00:37:27.20 --> 00:37:28.56 Doesn't
00:37:28.56 --> 00:37:35.28 Everyone I know who starts jjitsu hurt something that's why I have holding off but and I would I will definitely come let you
00:37:35.84 --> 00:37:38.88 Ragged all me but my point is that
00:37:38.88 --> 00:37:46.56 I've lost it and I'm probably the last guy to give you advice right now on how to lock out the world because I
00:37:47.20 --> 00:37:50.88 Have to put on headphones and crank music to get through a workout
00:37:51.92 --> 00:37:57.68 Right now and and I know this I didn't know I'm detrimental in it and I and I'm aware of it and I'm trying to correct it and
00:37:59.76 --> 00:38:04.72 And it bugs the shit out of me. It really does it makes me feel like less of a person
00:38:04.72 --> 00:38:09.12 So let me tell you about a transition that I went through yes first of all before the war
00:38:09.60 --> 00:38:15.44 Then military sent me to college so I had to go to college and I as I said early or as I've said before
00:38:15.44 --> 00:38:17.28 I was super focused when I went to college
00:38:17.60 --> 00:38:19.84 I've been in the seal teams for 10 years
00:38:19.84 --> 00:38:24.08 I was a go-gator. I was a hard charger. I was like oh you want me to read this book boom
00:38:24.08 --> 00:38:29.68 I would sit down and just force myself to read it and then got back to the seal teams and
00:38:29.68 --> 00:38:36.32 And like like what I went to college. I literally read every single thing that I was assigned and
00:38:36.96 --> 00:38:42.24 Nobody does that in college. Nobody does that. I read every single page of every single thing
00:38:42.24 --> 00:38:46.80 I was assigned during college. That's ridiculous. It's almost a waste of time. It's almost embarrassed
00:38:47.44 --> 00:38:49.20 Echo definitely thinks it's a waste of time
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.64 But but it was because I just could just
00:38:53.76 --> 00:38:57.12 Lock my brain down and get it done. Yeah, get back to the teams and in the teams
00:38:57.12 --> 00:39:03.44 Offs are in the teams you have a lot of administrative platforms to do evaluations and after actions reports and all these things
00:39:03.44 --> 00:39:07.28 And I would do the same thing. I was going to lock down mode and my brain on it and boom
00:39:07.28 --> 00:39:13.000 I'd go through it and just get it done. I would just be able to focus so they each thing laser focus
00:39:13.20 --> 00:39:15.20 So these are focused that report done God
00:39:15.20 --> 00:39:17.20 Me, give me a gun
00:39:17.20 --> 00:39:20.40 Report done okay, okay, so I
00:39:21.04 --> 00:39:24.24 Go to Iraq the first time no big deal. I go to Iraq the second time
00:39:24.24 --> 00:39:27.44 Did you know it's a much tougher deployment
00:39:28.08 --> 00:39:30.08 It's
00:39:30.08 --> 00:39:32.08 Guys are getting wounded guys my guys are getting killed
00:39:33.92 --> 00:39:35.92 And I come home and
00:39:35.92 --> 00:39:37.92 I get put into
00:39:37.92 --> 00:39:44.32 Run in the training and with running the training all of a sudden yeah, there's administrative requirements and there was administrative requirements overseas as well
00:39:44.32 --> 00:39:46.32 And you know what we did locked them down and got them done
00:39:47.28 --> 00:39:50.56 I get home and I remember the first time I get to do
00:39:50.56 --> 00:39:55.52 I think it's evaluations which in the military and the Navy anyways doing evaluations is a real pain
00:39:55.52 --> 00:39:57.76 It's a real big administrative administration of or a
00:39:58.32 --> 00:40:04.56 Value of all the troops. Yeah, so at this place I was at huge running training at a hundred guys and everyone of them is like a little mini
00:40:05.52 --> 00:40:09.60 Turn paper or something and it has to be perfect right? It's in the person's military
00:40:09.60 --> 00:40:11.12 Reckered forever. They're really stressful about it
00:40:11.52 --> 00:40:14.48 And I used to have no problem just hammering those things out
00:40:14.96 --> 00:40:18.16 So I get back from that deployment and and I'm sitting down and and
00:40:18.16 --> 00:40:21.44 You know, I start doing them like this this stupid
00:40:22.16 --> 00:40:29.84 This doesn't matter. I don't know why I'm doing this. All right. Well how do I have to do that kind of sort of do to say in the same things that I would always brag on people for saying like this is stupid
00:40:29.84 --> 00:40:33.44 Oh, now you're men or stupid you don't want to fill out the report and take care of your guys
00:40:33.44 --> 00:40:37.44 You don't want to go right into good. I like their career. Yeah, isn't worth your five-months
00:40:37.44 --> 00:40:40.08 You're fine. Okay, you know, so I
00:40:40.08 --> 00:40:43.12 But I heard myself saying this right and
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000 What what the constant
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.28 Under tone of all this was that this stuff doesn't matter
00:40:52.32 --> 00:40:56.96 Combat was what mattered and when you get back from that situation where
00:40:57.68 --> 00:41:02.88 Man your buddies are get killed you're getting wounded your friends are getting wounded this piece of paper
00:41:02.88 --> 00:41:07.20 It doesn't matter and you say to yourself. I don't care about this
00:41:09.44 --> 00:41:11.44 And at some point
00:41:11.44 --> 00:41:18.96 And it didn't took me maybe two or three months. I did what I had to do to get by but as I sit there and I looked at myself
00:41:20.40 --> 00:41:22.40 And I said you know what
00:41:25.52 --> 00:41:29.52 Combat doesn't matter any more
00:41:31.20 --> 00:41:33.20 You're not in it
00:41:33.20 --> 00:41:35.20 You're not in it right now
00:41:35.20 --> 00:41:43.60 This is now what matters your your mind was still there my mind was still there thinking that that was all that matters and like I said on our last podcast
00:41:44.32 --> 00:41:48.56 Actually it's in the past and it doesn't matter anymore
00:41:48.72 --> 00:41:56.24 So you know what you have to do you have to be a man and you have to do your job now and this is what matters now
00:41:57.68 --> 00:42:00.88 And that to me you made a big transition for me and it you know
00:42:00.88 --> 00:42:06.40 I haven't even thought about this until until you were talking about it because I remember what it was like to to go from
00:42:06.96 --> 00:42:12.24 When I went to college and when I was before I deployed reminding now would just be so laser focused
00:42:12.24 --> 00:42:17.68 Beacuse build it just burn through things and then when I got back and it was not there and it was all because I thought
00:42:17.68 --> 00:42:22.24 All this stuff doesn't matter this doesn't matter it doesn't matter what matters you know
00:42:22.24 --> 00:42:27.92 There's guys getting killed overseas right now. That's what matters and I had to say you know what no that stuff doesn't matter right now
00:42:27.92 --> 00:42:34.88 And you know I also I was in charge of training and I said what matters is doing this getting guys trained to go overseas
00:42:34.88 --> 00:42:40.40 And I became obsessed with that and slightly psychotic about getting guys ready for combat
00:42:40.40 --> 00:42:41.68 I mean I was
00:42:41.68 --> 00:42:45.52 Preparing them for what they were preparing them to go into for what they were going into and you know
00:42:45.52 --> 00:42:47.20 You could I'm sure there were many
00:42:47.76 --> 00:42:54.24 Seals that went through the training that I was overall in charge of and wood a test of the fact that I was probably borderline
00:42:55.04 --> 00:42:57.04 Psychopathic at that point
00:42:57.04 --> 00:43:03.52 But I think that's what I want right in my training. Oh, if that's dude, but I want to psycho running my combat training
00:43:03.52 --> 00:43:05.20 Yeah, yep
00:43:05.20 --> 00:43:07.92 So I think what go ahead
00:43:08.16 --> 00:43:11.12 Okay, you're just gonna say you think I think that
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.88 Telling yourself and recognizing to yourself why are you trying to do this thing?
00:43:17.12 --> 00:43:19.52 Because you're trying to do something because it does matter
00:43:19.92 --> 00:43:23.20 Right it has to matter in some way even if it's just
00:43:23.20 --> 00:43:29.92 But filling out the paperwork to get your license from the DMV. Yeah, yeah, oh that doesn't matter. Oh, actually know what it does matter
00:43:30.32 --> 00:43:34.32 You're gonna get arrested if you get pollinux like no, it does matter these little things these little
00:43:34.72 --> 00:43:36.72 Stupid meaningless tasks in life
00:43:36.72 --> 00:43:41.68 They actually do matter so you know what you do you line them up and you freaking crush him. That's what you do
00:43:42.08 --> 00:43:49.04 That's what you do you line up these stupid meaningless things and you crush them and you use them as an exercise in discipline
00:43:49.04 --> 00:43:53.60 They become an exercise in discipline. Oh, this thing doesn't matter guess what I'm going to crush it now
00:43:54.16 --> 00:43:57.12 Bring it to me where's my DMV form watch me fill this out
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.32 That's what I'm gonna do so maybe I turn like some little meaningless things into a personal competition of discipline
00:44:04.56 --> 00:44:08.32 But how consistent are you making that happen though?
00:44:10.24 --> 00:44:11.60 This I mean
00:44:11.60 --> 00:44:15.44 So for for instance since we started the podcast I
00:44:15.44 --> 00:44:17.44 I have to read
00:44:18.24 --> 00:44:23.12 You know basically a book a week and then once I read it I've got to go back into it
00:44:23.12 --> 00:44:28.32 Yeah, you do like a book report and and go back through it and say and how is this gonna flow together?
00:44:28.32 --> 00:44:33.20 What part so I'm spending a lot of time on that right now and I've been able to do it
00:44:34.24 --> 00:44:36.24 Every time so far
00:44:36.64 --> 00:44:39.92 So I think my because I've lost my ability to be consistent
00:44:41.04 --> 00:44:43.44 And that's what that's what's really bumming me out
00:44:43.44 --> 00:44:48.16 Like when I when I your book isn't I mean it's thick, but
00:44:48.88 --> 00:44:52.72 I should have been able to read this in two or three solid days of reading yes
00:44:53.12 --> 00:44:58.56 I told you how successful I was yes, not very and that bugs this shit out of
00:44:59.84 --> 00:45:01.84 And it's a it's a it's a
00:45:03.76 --> 00:45:05.76 It's a fail it's a
00:45:07.04 --> 00:45:12.32 You know what though I think this is a failure in my part I think that this is the same thing
00:45:12.32 --> 00:45:16.24 It when you were talking about on the last podcast and I think echo said
00:45:17.92 --> 00:45:24.24 When you say oh you know what I'm not gonna finish this book right now. It's it I don't really want to it's sort of like when you say oh
00:45:24.24 --> 00:45:28.32 I'm not gonna quit it's not that I want to though that's what I'm saying you say
00:45:28.32 --> 00:45:32.64 But I don't want to do it right now. I can push it off a little bit you accept that
00:45:33.52 --> 00:45:35.52 You accept that answer
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.64 You accept that answer the soldier
00:45:38.64 --> 00:45:45.36 Joe D right wouldn't accept that answer would not do you self talk?
00:45:46.24 --> 00:45:48.24 Not really
00:45:48.24 --> 00:45:52.32 Not really I'm not a guy that says you know I'm gonna do this or we're gonna do that. I just do it
00:45:52.96 --> 00:45:56.64 Right I just go and do whatever that thing is I think because you you
00:45:57.84 --> 00:46:03.92 Kind of have become that so it's more of like I mean put kind of crudely that's habitual for you to just do it
00:46:03.92 --> 00:46:07.92 You know remember how and it was I think it was kind of funny where I use this example
00:46:07.92 --> 00:46:13.20 Like how you said use it as an exercise of different discipline so I I said this example one time
00:46:13.52 --> 00:46:16.56 Where I was in line at the grocery store and I had
00:46:17.44 --> 00:46:21.84 12 pack of beer do we have to relive this story right now and I'll stand in line
00:46:21.84 --> 00:46:26.80 There's maybe three four people in front of me so I'm like all right, it's gonna be a while for me to get up there
00:46:26.80 --> 00:46:31.52 This beer is getting into sighted you're gonna hold the beer. I remember this story. I remember this story. Yeah
00:46:31.76 --> 00:46:36.72 So exactly right, but it wasn't that okay and the reason I decide to hold the beer wasn't because that
00:46:36.72 --> 00:46:43.84 Benefit did me right then it it was an exercise in mental health. But here's the crate. Okay, we're getting we're way off
00:46:44.32 --> 00:46:46.32 The question but
00:46:46.08 --> 00:46:48.56 Physical task sure no problem yeah
00:46:48.80 --> 00:46:51.84 Because it's it's visceral. It's real. I don't feel it
00:46:52.24 --> 00:47:00.16 But to sit down and and and read the report on the sewer charges that are gonna be coming in on the tax report for the city next year
00:47:02.08 --> 00:47:05.52 What's on what's going on on Twitter? Yeah, it all like it's kind of the same thing though
00:47:05.52 --> 00:47:10.88 Really except but I'm wondering I'm wondering if my brain hasn't replaced the oxy cotton with social media
00:47:11.76 --> 00:47:14.08 Yeah, like I had to quit drinking because
00:47:15.60 --> 00:47:20.16 Okay, we now are way off the thing, but the the hardcover came out last September
00:47:21.20 --> 00:47:26.40 And the hardcover I'm just sorry if I'm flinching the making of a Canadian sniper by jodimitic
00:47:26.96 --> 00:47:32.000 Printed by Simon and Schuster and we want to avail on Amazon through joccostore dot com
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000 Click the link Tam is on
00:47:36.72 --> 00:47:40.64 But yeah, okay, yeah, I already said it I already said it so anyway
00:47:41.12 --> 00:47:49.44 The hardcover came out drinking I drank every day from the date came up that so we had 450 people at the event
00:47:50.88 --> 00:47:54.96 Kevin Newman my buddy who's who's a he's a well-known news anchor in Canada
00:47:55.36 --> 00:47:59.52 Doesn't interview with me on the stage and we got standing ovation
00:47:59.52 --> 00:48:02.88 We go oh we celebrate me the president of the company my editor
00:48:03.28 --> 00:48:10.96 Wait we have a good night the next day if I wasn't having one drink I was having 10 and that went from September to the new year
00:48:12.24 --> 00:48:18.56 And I was getting fat and I you know I was sleeping in because I'm hung over and I'm not going to the gym and and I went hang on
00:48:19.84 --> 00:48:24.000 What's going on because this is it because I have my job as politician
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:31.20 I'm daddy you know I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm advocate and then you know the book is it's a job right?
00:48:31.20 --> 00:48:34.000 You know, I'm selling a book's a job full-time job
00:48:34.64 --> 00:48:37.36 I need nine days a week and 36 hours a day to do it
00:48:38.72 --> 00:48:43.68 And so I had to make that's one of the reasons why I decided to do the bodybuilding thing because I'm like what you can't drink
00:48:44.80 --> 00:48:49.84 And it'll be right till November because I need that so I'm trying to figure out if my brain is looking for a new habit
00:48:49.84 --> 00:48:55.60 Because I was diagnosed before as like anti-addictive if that's even a real thing
00:48:55.60 --> 00:49:00.56 But I had a doctor tell me what she's like you're pretty much an anti-addictive personality
00:49:01.04 --> 00:49:04.48 Like you won't get addicted to stuff and there I was addicted to doxy cotton
00:49:06.16 --> 00:49:10.64 Even though it's a physical thing more than a mental thing, but I still wouldn't trust me with a pill right now
00:49:11.20 --> 00:49:12.40 Yeah
00:49:12.40 --> 00:49:18.24 Anyway, I think that we got way off track, but I just again and I don't know what your therapist is just gonna tell you
00:49:18.24 --> 00:49:20.24 I'm gonna tell you what jacco would tell you though
00:49:20.64 --> 00:49:24.08 These little things are things that you I know
00:49:24.96 --> 00:49:29.28 You know how to do them you've done them your whole career in the military
00:49:29.68 --> 00:49:31.68 You were watching a crossroad and
00:49:31.92 --> 00:49:35.76 I know that might sound exciting to people that are out there that are thinking how crazy that must be
00:49:35.76 --> 00:49:40.32 No, there's times where Joe dude was walking watching a crossroad and there was nothing going on for four days
00:49:40.48 --> 00:49:42.48 Yeah, and he was watching that crossroad and
00:49:42.48 --> 00:49:48.56 And so you have that in you yeah, you just gotta tell yourself that you know what this stuff now
00:49:48.88 --> 00:49:51.92 This is what matters and how you gonna tell yourself that this is what matters
00:49:51.92 --> 00:49:55.76 It's because this is how it connects to the strategic picture
00:49:56.32 --> 00:50:01.60 You can't say that this matters because of what it is right in front of me just like when you're looking at the crossroads
00:50:01.60 --> 00:50:04.88 You're not thinking oh this crossroads is important because the crossroads is
00:50:05.28 --> 00:50:09.68 Important no the car the reason it's important is because you are supporting keeping guys alive
00:50:09.68 --> 00:50:14.56 Which is gonna help a mission out which is gonna help the the overall strategy win
00:50:14.56 --> 00:50:17.92 Commanders intent the commanders intent the whole mind on the commander now
00:50:18.32 --> 00:50:22.72 You want to man and also what's your long-term mission and that's what kind of you just set yourself like
00:50:22.72 --> 00:50:25.28 All I picked bodybuilding because I there you just gave yourself a mission
00:50:25.36 --> 00:50:27.36 Right, so what's your administrative mission?
00:50:27.36 --> 00:50:31.28 You know echoes made some big advances lately because he started freaking reading books
00:50:31.84 --> 00:50:36.24 Nice and he wasn't doing that before but he got the long-term mission of like you know what?
00:50:36.24 --> 00:50:43.92 I'm gonna learn as much as I possibly can so you got a long-term mission with your constituents right to be the best
00:50:44.88 --> 00:50:46.48 City councilman and
00:50:46.48 --> 00:50:53.76 Represent so when they ask you a question you're like boom that's kind of the course psychos tough that I would say is like if anybody ever asked me a question
00:50:54.16 --> 00:50:58.16 Like when I was gonna college if I asked me any question about it either reading I'm gonna know it
00:50:58.72 --> 00:51:00.72 That's just the bizarre
00:51:00.72 --> 00:51:08.40 What's that OCD thing to be like I'm gonna know everything so you have four kids you train every day
00:51:09.76 --> 00:51:12.08 You get up at four in the morning. I got to get up before I'm
00:51:15.68 --> 00:51:19.04 Sorry to riff on you guys on that man like I know you want to do the questions
00:51:19.04 --> 00:51:24.24 But when that guy when that like the the the first question was easy because I'm like all just talk about what I used to do
00:51:24.24 --> 00:51:26.24 And then that one was like well
00:51:26.24 --> 00:51:32.96 If I was to try and answer right now, I'd be lying. I'd be a liar. Yeah, and I can't I have my moment still
00:51:32.96 --> 00:51:39.04 Don't get me wrong. I'll have moments where I'm like this has to get done and I'll fire through a speech or I'll write a report or
00:51:39.52 --> 00:51:42.32 Whatever it is and then and then I lose it and it's like ah
00:51:43.04 --> 00:51:45.04 It's gone. It that's actually
00:51:45.76 --> 00:51:51.36 Reenforcing what I just said so when you have a near-term mission that you know what the outcome
00:51:51.60 --> 00:51:54.56 You know what the result is you know at the end state is you know what the commander's intent is like
00:51:54.56 --> 00:51:56.56 Hey, you got to speech in two days
00:51:57.44 --> 00:52:00.16 Okay, now it's in one day you can sit down and concentrate and get it done
00:52:00.64 --> 00:52:04.64 Which where you've missed the connection now is the connection between these
00:52:04.88 --> 00:52:06.88 Minion tasks that
00:52:07.52 --> 00:52:13.84 Don't mean anything and how can I put them to a long-term strategic goal and one of those long-term strategic goals
00:52:13.84 --> 00:52:18.88 You can put into place if nothing else is I'm gonna discipline my mind to do these
00:52:19.04 --> 00:52:21.04 Minion tasks like a soldier
00:52:21.04 --> 00:52:25.20 And that's pretty cool. Oh, yeah, it's a t-shirt
00:52:27.04 --> 00:52:29.84 Thank you, Jocco, but whoever asked I question
00:52:30.24 --> 00:52:35.04 Thank you for asking it although I went off and talked about me for the most speaking attention
00:52:35.04 --> 00:52:40.08 Echoes take a little further out. No, it's not a tangent. It's what you said how you said that's what a soldier does
00:52:40.08 --> 00:52:45.12 So that's like a little exercise and and I did this before I did this in a couple of times
00:52:45.36 --> 00:52:49.48 Okay, like one was how I quit drinking was I
00:52:49.48 --> 00:52:55.40 Figured out and you can do this with your diet as well. I figured out that basically through all the stuff that I read that
00:52:55.96 --> 00:53:04.12 You're wanting to eat junk food or drink or whatever is your brain tricking you because it's built to it's evolved for a certain environment
00:53:04.12 --> 00:53:09.12 That that environment doesn't work isn't around anymore. Yeah, yeah, so now we're an environment of
00:53:09.12 --> 00:53:11.12 abundance that has to do with all means anyway
00:53:11.12 --> 00:53:17.72 Can the conclusion that it's your brain falling for a trick your physiology of your brain falling for a trick makes you want this stuff
00:53:17.72 --> 00:53:24.20 How he says how Jocco says that's not what a soldier would do I had it in my mind
00:53:24.20 --> 00:53:29.44 I'm not gonna fall for that trick. I'm not a sucker. That's not you know doing this is what suckers do
00:53:29.44 --> 00:53:32.56 I'm not a sucker. This is just like self talking to yourself
00:53:33.32 --> 00:53:41.64 So I essentially shamed myself out of drinking. Yeah, just like he's doing the basically the inverse into focusing
00:53:41.64 --> 00:53:47.36 You know, I just remember like I've I'm the guy that we in co-sivo I quit smoking in a day
00:53:48.36 --> 00:53:52.88 Because I couldn't run up the hill next to our camp. I said well obviously these things aren't
00:53:53.76 --> 00:54:00.12 Good anymore and I literally just I just I even had a pack on my pocket for like a week. I just like
00:54:00.12 --> 00:54:04.68 Yeah, okay, throw those in I want that guy back and I'm in search
00:54:04.68 --> 00:54:07.92 I think it's been 10 years since I was wounded. I think I'm gonna find him again
00:54:07.92 --> 00:54:14.60 Probably on the stage for this bodybuilding thing or something, but yeah, I just I just couldn't answer that question without
00:54:14.80 --> 00:54:20.92 Talking about that because I don't I wouldn't have been truthful at this point in my life and that's what's cool
00:54:20.92 --> 00:54:25.28 It's maybe that question right there or something that is forcing you to face that
00:54:25.28 --> 00:54:27.68 I mean you might have had it the back of your mind, but now you're going you know what?
00:54:27.68 --> 00:54:29.88 I can't answer that I don't think is I'm not there right now
00:54:29.88 --> 00:54:32.94 I'm not but I'm gonna get back there real quick my moments
00:54:33.48 --> 00:54:35.48 So standby people standby
00:54:35.84 --> 00:54:37.84 soldiers coming back online
00:54:37.84 --> 00:54:39.84 reboot jodie three point out
00:54:41.36 --> 00:54:43.36 All right next question
00:54:45.40 --> 00:54:53.16 That this is all this read it how you prepared mentally what kind of discipline you had routines in and out of battle
00:54:54.88 --> 00:54:56.88 How I prepared mentally
00:54:56.88 --> 00:55:08.000 routine routine in and out of battle yep, what kind of discipline you had and routines in and out of battle?
00:55:11.20 --> 00:55:13.20 I'm gonna fall back on
00:55:15.24 --> 00:55:21.88 Mental routine I think is probably your your your biggest because the physical one is easy
00:55:21.88 --> 00:55:27.20 Okay, you come back so battle doesn't mean you know you're in gun fights all the time
00:55:27.20 --> 00:55:32.60 You know like like we say you first and instill were patrolling right you know, which is a static patrol
00:55:32.84 --> 00:55:34.20 So
00:55:34.20 --> 00:55:37.60 You know you gotta make sure your gear is good you gotta make you know
00:55:37.60 --> 00:55:42.68 Are your batteries changed right you got like there's all the ways the checklist check list check list check list as a leader
00:55:42.84 --> 00:55:48.04 It actually makes it easier I found because now I have a reason to check their stuff and
00:55:48.04 --> 00:55:53.56 Check that their routine so my routine stayed solid right because other I had other guys I had to worry about
00:55:56.56 --> 00:56:03.76 So rest is a big one I used to have to order my guys to go to ground because they were so because there's only three of us
00:56:04.48 --> 00:56:09.24 And I used to my berry especially I'd be like berry you need to be useful
00:56:09.24 --> 00:56:15.68 I need you to sleep so my routine was like make sure enough rest make sure because you know that
00:56:15.68 --> 00:56:17.68 The saying mission before man
00:56:19.88 --> 00:56:24.000 Sure except when the man is the mission so I need my man to be good
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.04 Yeah, and I'm gonna say if you abuse your man too much you won't accomplish the mission. Yeah, like you know
00:56:28.04 --> 00:56:31.92 You know the sacrifice the body well, let's wait. Let's think about that
00:56:32.72 --> 00:56:36.08 Because the body is what needs to get this thing. There's only there's only three of us
00:56:37.16 --> 00:56:42.12 And our you know of your sniper your you might be alone you might be with the one or two other guys
00:56:42.12 --> 00:56:48.64 I can't afford to have a guy run head hit first through doorway to get through it because I need him to be useful after
00:56:48.80 --> 00:56:55.56 You know if you have a platoon sure you sacrifice Smith he runs through the door. Hey, okay. I got 29 more guys. I can go through the door
00:56:56.84 --> 00:57:00.32 So my routine was always like you know make sure everything's topped up
00:57:02.08 --> 00:57:07.40 Keep an eye out you know do the check do the mental checklist and then visualize visual like
00:57:07.40 --> 00:57:12.88 Out of battle. I would try to you know I'd be on my I remember I'd lay on my bunk
00:57:12.88 --> 00:57:22.72 And I'd have my and I'd always end up with my right foot crossed over my left foot and my and my my arms up here on my chest and I'd have my head back
00:57:22.72 --> 00:57:25.40 And I would be going okay, so
00:57:26.84 --> 00:57:30.96 Okay, we go down and you know and it if contact left and I would try to like you know
00:57:31.64 --> 00:57:34.26 Visualize these things, you know because as the team leader
00:57:34.26 --> 00:57:41.70 I had the radio and I was security because my boys when they're in position, you know my spotter is spotting my shooter is shooting so like they're
00:57:42.30 --> 00:57:43.82 12 o'clock
00:57:43.82 --> 00:57:48.66 So I'm now everything everything the rest of the clock for them and for myself
00:57:49.62 --> 00:57:51.62 So I was constantly
00:57:51.62 --> 00:58:02.74 Rehersing mentally what would what could happen? I'm calling and I'm practicing a call for fire. I'm practicing and calling in an air strike and practicing a nine liner. I'm practicing
00:58:04.54 --> 00:58:11.12 Just a grit what do you guys do you guys use that turns the nine line for nine nine line is a casual to you back
00:58:11.94 --> 00:58:16.86 Call for fire nine line. Yeah, no, no, but grit and I group range indication
00:58:16.86 --> 00:58:24.06 Fire yep, yep, so my first even with all the visualization my first actual grit in a battle was
00:58:27.06 --> 00:58:29.06 It's supposed to be
00:58:29.06 --> 00:58:31.06 63
00:58:31.06 --> 00:58:33.06 300 by that tree
00:58:33.78 --> 00:58:35.30 You know all you know
00:58:36.30 --> 00:58:41.34 Far for effect or at your own time or something like the calm cool collected voice
00:58:41.34 --> 00:58:47.34 But you know the guy was like 40 meters away and I was like a digit in my sniper was actually looking over him
00:58:47.70 --> 00:58:52.86 Wave he's like I'm you know, I'm looking at that stuff and I was like fuck it. I just shot on myself, but
00:58:54.42 --> 00:58:56.42 But my point is that
00:58:56.42 --> 00:59:01.18 Even with all that practice and visualization and training, you know, that was my first attempt
00:59:02.54 --> 00:59:06.14 So I was always just trying to make sure that my routine off
00:59:06.14 --> 00:59:11.74 Off the battlefield was putting my mind back, but in a controlled setting
00:59:12.62 --> 00:59:20.74 You know and and and and then also like I said make sure okay. Yeah, how much sleep did you get? Okay? Good good good and that's the routine that you know
00:59:21.30 --> 00:59:25.42 You got to get the guys to relax especially like for me. I had to
00:59:27.14 --> 00:59:31.90 I just had to make sure because I only had me and two other guys I couldn't afford to lose one of them
00:59:31.90 --> 00:59:37.58 Whether it was to exhaustion or malnutrition or dehydration or spray n ankles or
00:59:38.06 --> 00:59:46.62 Whatever, you know, so I just I just did my best to keep keep that checklist going and and visual and I would encourage them to do the same
00:59:47.18 --> 00:59:49.26 I'd be like hey, what are you thinking about over there?
00:59:49.66 --> 00:59:52.06 Oh, you know, whatever, I'd be like hey, you want you to think about it
00:59:52.06 --> 00:59:57.90 You know remember when you made like for doing making that shot and you missed or whatever like trying visualized
00:59:57.90 --> 01:00:04.46 Trying to think about what you did you know there's a lot of steps that go into pulling the trigger, you know, and and and then you know
01:00:04.70 --> 01:00:07.50 Just think about that think about how it happened and and
01:00:08.38 --> 01:00:10.38 Encourage that you know, I'm I'm a big fan of
01:00:11.98 --> 01:00:14.38 Meditation and yoga and all that stuff like
01:00:15.82 --> 01:00:18.06 If any and like I think and our
01:00:18.14 --> 01:00:23.50 Side of the world we've lost a lot of that stuff and I know we try to get it back and got people that do it are
01:00:23.50 --> 01:00:29.90 Tree hugging you know, Spandex wearing weirdos or whatever, but yoga and
01:00:30.46 --> 01:00:34.94 Meditation and stuff like that's all warrior culture from the past
01:00:35.98 --> 01:00:38.78 You know like samurai meditate
01:00:39.50 --> 01:00:41.50 You know, eight warrior monks
01:00:41.66 --> 01:00:48.30 Fasted and prayed that's just meditation and they looked inside themselves a lot to try and you know
01:00:48.30 --> 01:00:57.98 Samurai's job was pretty tough call me pussy for meditated make sure I'm there so I could watch and and I and I firmly believe that that
01:00:58.62 --> 01:01:00.62 Type of stuff keeps you functional
01:01:01.42 --> 01:01:06.70 For when you hit the battlefield, you know that self you know as Grossman calls it the self for flexion
01:01:07.34 --> 01:01:09.34 Self inoculation as well
01:01:09.34 --> 01:01:10.38 So
01:01:10.38 --> 01:01:12.70 That was my routine it was just a constant
01:01:12.70 --> 01:01:21.18 Rotation of thoughts and then but the actions were always to prepare the you know the the situation for what was coming
01:01:21.74 --> 01:01:23.74 So make sense?
01:01:23.74 --> 01:01:25.26 Yeah, okay, yeah the one
01:01:26.38 --> 01:01:30.46 One thing that I that's actually a pro I like a really practical thing that I did
01:01:32.14 --> 01:01:34.14 That in that is I had
01:01:34.78 --> 01:01:39.10 This again, this is just like a real practical thing I had two cuts
01:01:39.10 --> 01:01:41.90 Right, it's up to the cot something one caught
01:01:42.70 --> 01:01:49.50 Something one caught the other caught was all my gear and it was just laid out gun body armor, you know everything was right there
01:01:50.30 --> 01:01:52.30 and when I
01:01:52.30 --> 01:01:54.30 When I got dressed to go out
01:01:54.86 --> 01:01:57.10 All that thing was empty and so
01:01:58.06 --> 01:02:02.54 Never forgot anything when I came back everything went right back on the cot
01:02:03.10 --> 01:02:05.10 Same spot everything squared away
01:02:05.10 --> 01:02:11.02 So those that to me was and I figured that out really quickly. Okay, just gonna I don't want everyone
01:02:11.02 --> 01:02:14.30 If we get anything here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna put everything that I need right here
01:02:15.10 --> 01:02:20.06 So I had I didn't even think of it around my you know how I said I would sit there
01:02:20.70 --> 01:02:22.06 Right foot over the left
01:02:22.06 --> 01:02:26.46 All around me because we had a cot we had a cot we didn't couldn't afford to
01:02:27.66 --> 01:02:29.66 But around
01:02:29.66 --> 01:02:32.70 I had we all had two by fours around us because we're in like a
01:02:32.70 --> 01:02:34.30 A
01:02:34.30 --> 01:02:39.66 Fob we built ourselves and each nail had it so I had my my chest rig my rifle
01:02:40.54 --> 01:02:43.66 My ammo pouches and then you know like and then all around and
01:02:43.98 --> 01:02:48.98 But that was what I would when I would go through my stuff that's what I mean like I would hang it up open up the pouch
01:02:49.18 --> 01:02:54.46 Okay, everything's there close it next pouch make sure top up my mags all that stuff and I would make sure
01:02:54.46 --> 01:02:56.30 I'd make get the guys into the same thing
01:02:56.30 --> 01:03:01.26 I know when you're ready to go out on operation all your nails are empty that means you've got everything
01:03:01.26 --> 01:03:06.14 Yeah, but the biggest thing with root like people people call a routine and they think there's magic to it
01:03:06.70 --> 01:03:12.30 Right, there's not it's it's just making sure you do the same thing over and over and over again, you know as as
01:03:13.10 --> 01:03:16.94 Magical as Navy seals and snipers want to be like it's not really that
01:03:18.06 --> 01:03:20.06 It's not that mystical I guess
01:03:20.86 --> 01:03:22.86 It's so it's just a lot of repetition
01:03:23.42 --> 01:03:28.46 You know the routine is that you repeat the same actions because that what's meant that's what makes you good at
01:03:28.46 --> 01:03:34.22 Yeah, I was telling you when we were driving over here or some point how we used to try and do
01:03:34.86 --> 01:03:40.46 Everything yeah when you would fire up like you know we'd have together five or six home fees lined up for an
01:03:40.46 --> 01:03:45.86 Operation that I'll be lined up ready to go and then everyone would like get the word it'd be like
01:03:46.14 --> 01:03:50.78 Load them up and then you just see everyone would just get in the zone boom
01:03:50.78 --> 01:03:54.14 You see everyone get into vehicles and then we'd start the vehicles at the same time
01:03:54.14 --> 01:04:00.06 There's no reason to do that no, but there is I know there is dog type. There's no there's no
01:04:01.10 --> 01:04:06.86 Definable reason why you would do that but our deal was you know okay
01:04:07.42 --> 01:04:14.14 Starting up in three two one start up and then you hear all the vehicle start up once and it's just like all those little things
01:04:14.14 --> 01:04:19.90 Would though all those little disciplines would lend themselves to the team being more disciplined those
01:04:19.90 --> 01:04:26.86 Ignition switches might as well have been the switch and each guy's mind. Yep. Yeah as the as that vehicle is starting
01:04:26.86 --> 01:04:32.06 Everyone's brain is going to into combat mode and we're together at the same time
01:04:32.06 --> 01:04:37.34 Synchronized from the word go when that had I love it when you told me that that was I was like yeah
01:04:37.50 --> 01:04:41.14 That'd be the most badass thing to watch but you're Navy's can't imagine
01:04:41.14 --> 01:04:45.30 What's a Navy seals load up and they have vehicles all started the same time? I'd run. I'd be like
01:04:45.30 --> 01:04:49.26 I'm not fucking with these guys. I'm out here. It was an awesome sight of it when my guys when I was a task
01:04:49.26 --> 01:04:52.54 Get a commander you know I'd be sitting on base as guys were rolling out and
01:04:53.74 --> 01:04:59.30 I'd stand out there and salute him like just like old school rakes, but it is you know it was
01:04:59.62 --> 01:05:04.58 And they I bet and they loved you for it. I love those guys, but the
01:05:07.82 --> 01:05:12.74 Those guys in me every time you rolled out in the streets of Ramadi there was a decent chance
01:05:13.26 --> 01:05:15.26 You're getting blown up
01:05:15.26 --> 01:05:21.82 There was a dude gunfight was almost guaranteed to happen, but the guys getting blown IDs was a real issue for you guys
01:05:21.82 --> 01:05:25.10 Hey, oh and and I was thinking about this today
01:05:26.10 --> 01:05:33.02 The IDs there was we had statistically the most heavily ID road in all of Iraq was route Michigan going from one end to the
01:05:33.54 --> 01:05:35.54 one end of Ramadi to the other yeah and
01:05:38.14 --> 01:05:41.70 There was IDs all over the place. I mean it was ridiculous and
01:05:42.78 --> 01:05:44.78 We didn't hit
01:05:44.78 --> 01:05:51.30 Any IDs while we were there which I was thinking about that today because I was thinking about my
01:05:52.02 --> 01:05:53.02 EOD contingent
01:05:53.02 --> 01:05:55.02 Yeah, two of you guys and
01:05:56.30 --> 01:05:59.86 I never told them like hey we never had an ID
01:06:00.30 --> 01:06:06.34 Thank you never told them that so you credit them with that. I credit them with part of it
01:06:06.34 --> 01:06:10.34 Yeah, yeah part of the briefings that they gave part of the now there was some close calls
01:06:10.34 --> 01:06:15.64 Laced platoon and that matter fact it's in the book when they the EOD guys were
01:06:16.02 --> 01:06:21.86 Watching the front door that couldn't quite keep an eye on it, but they were they did a really good inspection of it when they came back out
01:06:21.86 --> 01:06:23.06 They like something looks different
01:06:23.06 --> 01:06:28.16 They went down there and there's 120 millimeter mortar ID that would have taken out out of four or five guys
01:06:29.30 --> 01:06:34.90 There was a time where we went over we went over an ID will
01:06:34.90 --> 01:06:41.98 The point man navigator in the vehicles was like hey, I think there's something specific suspicious
01:06:42.90 --> 01:06:47.14 Actually got out of the vehicle to look at it. We're like, you know looking back
01:06:47.30 --> 01:06:50.82 What do you think about that decision making process? You know, maybe that wasn't a good one
01:06:50.82 --> 01:06:54.10 Anyways, we decided oh, I don't think it is we drove over it in about
01:06:55.06 --> 01:06:57.46 half an hour later the ID
01:06:57.86 --> 01:07:02.58 Clarence team found a triple stack 120 so that's everybody in the vehicle dead
01:07:02.58 --> 01:07:04.58 Um
01:07:04.58 --> 01:07:05.94 If if you hit it
01:07:05.94 --> 01:07:13.78 So yeah, IEDs were massive threat the number of guys that were killed and wounded by IEDs and Ramadi was your take as it was a whole there was a vehicle graveyard
01:07:14.66 --> 01:07:21.38 You know vehicles that had been blown up and then dragged back in with I mean it was it was massive. I mean
01:07:22.66 --> 01:07:27.78 I want to say 50 to 100 vehicles are these piled up and including M-Raps
01:07:27.78 --> 01:07:31.06 Which are the mind resistant vehicles those things are in their broken and half
01:07:31.06 --> 01:07:34.18 What kind of bomb do you got to put together to do that?
01:07:35.06 --> 01:07:36.42 We
01:07:36.42 --> 01:07:43.86 Rouge we got real lucky and I know this sounds weird my rotation they had conventional mines
01:07:44.98 --> 01:07:46.98 So any purse and any tank and
01:07:47.94 --> 01:07:51.06 There was the occasional IED but it was usually SV
01:07:52.74 --> 01:07:57.06 And and in the city SV means suicide vehicle so
01:07:57.06 --> 01:08:03.54 our our regimental sergeant major in his driver were killed by a suicide vehicle born IED
01:08:04.58 --> 01:08:08.74 And I stepped on a landmine if I'd stepped on an IED I would have been vaporized
01:08:09.38 --> 01:08:13.46 But the rotation that that replaced us there's sister battalion
01:08:14.42 --> 01:08:19.54 That's when we the the intelligence says guys from Iraq started showing up and
01:08:19.54 --> 01:08:26.90 And we went from losing a tire maybe having one guy get killed through a penetration in the
01:08:26.90 --> 01:08:34.18 Hull or whatever to we had a whole lab go up and seven out of the ten guys in it were killed
01:08:34.90 --> 01:08:38.58 And it was like like that's how quickly it escalated yeah and
01:08:38.98 --> 01:08:41.46 Suddenly it was an issue for our guys as well
01:08:42.02 --> 01:08:48.26 Almost every vehicle we had hit a landmine on my tour and that was the only time I was ever really scared over there
01:08:48.26 --> 01:08:51.86 When I was walking or an helicopter or even out on a four wheeler
01:08:52.34 --> 01:08:56.66 No problem when I had to drive on the roads in a vehicle
01:08:57.22 --> 01:09:01.06 That's when I was like my that pucker factor was the highest for me ever
01:09:02.02 --> 01:09:08.34 IED man like the guys I would go out every day and deal with that shit like IED clearance guys fox man like
01:09:08.90 --> 01:09:13.78 My hat always came off to those guys. Oh, yeah, like talk about a nerve-racking job
01:09:13.78 --> 01:09:18.42 Yeah, right yeah, what's that movie with uh
01:09:21.30 --> 01:09:25.06 With the EOD guy I don't know hurt locker hurt locker
01:09:25.94 --> 01:09:29.62 I'm like everybody who does that jobs is it's a total bullshit movie
01:09:29.62 --> 01:09:34.74 But yeah, like could you imagine though that's your gig well like we had an embedded EOD guys with us and
01:09:35.30 --> 01:09:41.46 See what usually have EOD Navy EOD guys right basically like two guys our guys were like they go through our training with us
01:09:41.46 --> 01:09:45.06 They don't go through the basic training the basic seal training
01:09:45.06 --> 01:09:48.02 But they go through everything else and our guys are like supporters
01:09:48.34 --> 01:09:54.18 No, well once our guys our guys were like other seals, you know, right they were that good yeah, and
01:09:55.78 --> 01:09:57.78 But yeah
01:09:57.78 --> 01:09:59.78 It's not it's amazing
01:10:00.18 --> 01:10:07.70 But and the guys that are with us that with us and so they're not quite it's their primary job for us, but it's not their primary job
01:10:07.70 --> 01:10:12.74 Right right whereas the guys that you're talking about the guys that did route clearance
01:10:14.58 --> 01:10:18.66 If anybody's listening to this podcast right now, if you did route clearance
01:10:19.14 --> 01:10:26.66 And I rack your FGN to thank you jockel and jodie say thank you because you saved us so many times
01:10:26.82 --> 01:10:31.86 Because we drove down those roads all time my guys drove down those roads all the time and you found all those bombs that saved
01:10:31.86 --> 01:10:39.38 Saved our lives and so many lives kept the supplies rolling have even kept the local populist safe
01:10:39.54 --> 01:10:42.74 And you know how much credit glory those guys get none
01:10:43.62 --> 01:10:45.38 not a lot none and
01:10:45.54 --> 01:10:50.02 It was in in Ramadi there'd be the the big vehicle like a buffalo
01:10:50.02 --> 01:10:53.46 You know a buffalo it's like a giant em wrap you have to climb a ladder to get into it
01:10:53.46 --> 01:10:56.26 So there'd be guys in there that would disable the bombs from inside
01:10:56.26 --> 01:11:00.10 They'd a big robotic arm and they would do that but behind them
01:11:00.10 --> 01:11:07.46 Would be a contingent of Marines in home v's and I'd say well, yeah, we're just support
01:11:09.46 --> 01:11:11.46 Get some devil dogs
01:11:12.42 --> 01:11:16.90 Marine Corps doesn't play around. They're like, oh, you need you need support cool to get home v's a roll behind it
01:11:16.90 --> 01:11:21.22 But there's gonna be big bombs growing up. Yeah, we're in the Marine Corps. Yeah, we know factor
01:11:21.62 --> 01:11:24.42 We'll be loving I love Marine Marine Corps is awesome
01:11:24.42 --> 01:11:28.74 Anyway questions from the interwebs questions from the interwebs
01:11:33.30 --> 01:11:35.30 Can you tell us about?
01:11:35.78 --> 01:11:40.34 Jody can you tell us about your wife the medic that helped save you?
01:11:41.70 --> 01:11:44.90 Now you kind of talked about this a little bit on the first podcast we did together
01:11:45.94 --> 01:11:49.46 So you know what I'll tell you about her so Alana is
01:11:49.46 --> 01:11:57.94 um, so I say her dad was in the army and he he's from Ireland. He immigrated to Canada
01:11:58.66 --> 01:12:04.74 Join the military and he was an airborne commando and and Canada back in the day like that was
01:12:05.78 --> 01:12:11.30 Pretty much you know that was our one of our most fierce units and he commanded the jump school
01:12:11.30 --> 01:12:16.98 Which is like whoa, wow that's that's pretty badass. He did the American Ranger course in 68
01:12:16.98 --> 01:12:22.18 Bane yeah, it's the old Vietnam Rangers were running up right in the show not old
01:12:22.50 --> 01:12:27.94 There are young guys. I should have said that that these fresh combat experience Rangers were running the show
01:12:28.18 --> 01:12:34.18 You know they weren't playing around yeah, he got kicked in the spine with a steel toe boot
01:12:34.18 --> 01:12:41.22 Yeah, and uh finished with a broken vertebra and but you know so I always say she was drafted
01:12:41.22 --> 01:12:46.82 Into the military at birth and because she grew up on bases all over the world Germany
01:12:48.82 --> 01:12:54.66 I think South America and stuff her dad ended up being in like embassy security and stuff
01:12:56.10 --> 01:12:58.74 She became a medic at a high school
01:13:00.50 --> 01:13:03.70 I think she joined it 17 as well. She's a little bit older than me
01:13:04.98 --> 01:13:06.98 and then
01:13:06.98 --> 01:13:11.70 She has more citations for saving civilians than she does for saving soldiers
01:13:12.66 --> 01:13:15.70 She happens upon she's like one of those
01:13:16.98 --> 01:13:18.98 Angels I guess that just
01:13:19.86 --> 01:13:23.22 One woman so here's one a woman had a heart attack behind the wheel
01:13:23.78 --> 01:13:26.82 drove into a ditch a land. I was right behind her drove
01:13:27.78 --> 01:13:32.50 Stopter card jumped in the car pulled her out dead a land of broader back to life
01:13:32.50 --> 01:13:40.26 Right there inside of the road no equipment and thing like that just skill skill and determination
01:13:40.82 --> 01:13:43.54 And kept her alive until the paramedics showed up and took over
01:13:44.58 --> 01:13:46.58 She's got a decoration for that um
01:13:47.70 --> 01:13:49.70 You know she helped save my life
01:13:51.30 --> 01:13:53.30 And a lot of my friends and
01:13:55.94 --> 01:13:59.70 One time we were driving and we came upon a scene
01:13:59.70 --> 01:14:03.94 And we were in my truck and Alo is still a baby
01:14:05.06 --> 01:14:11.54 Still in our baby seat and so I look up and I and I see it. I think she she might have been on a phone
01:14:11.54 --> 01:14:13.70 I don't know what she was doing and I see
01:14:14.82 --> 01:14:18.74 Scatter cars car parts everywhere and one lone cop
01:14:19.86 --> 01:14:21.46 Standing in the middle of it like a squirrel
01:14:22.34 --> 01:14:25.30 And not because he's scared or anything. He's just he's the only guy
01:14:25.30 --> 01:14:32.74 He's the first on the scene and I look and I'm like okay something bad happened here and I and I see one vehicle in the middle of it all
01:14:32.74 --> 01:14:34.74 And I went a lana they need you
01:14:35.78 --> 01:14:39.54 And she went huh I see see that van they need you
01:14:40.66 --> 01:14:47.86 She jumped out jumped head first through the this van was crushed and she went in there and there were the four-year-old little three-year-old little girl
01:14:48.42 --> 01:14:52.82 That had been hit with the car was tea-boned she stabilized the little girl spine
01:14:52.82 --> 01:14:56.02 Kept her alive until the fireman showed up
01:14:56.58 --> 01:14:59.54 They extracted she she wasn't command of the scene
01:15:00.26 --> 01:15:06.58 They they were like they they I guess I was doing my best to help the cop a traffic and and stuff like this and
01:15:08.18 --> 01:15:10.42 And deal with some of the other like minor injuries and
01:15:10.98 --> 01:15:16.34 The fireman like the first guy to put his head in he's like I kind of heard like well, who is this and then
01:15:16.34 --> 01:15:20.42 Alo here is Lanna like I need this and I need like she's barking out all these orders and like
01:15:20.42 --> 01:15:29.14 Which yeah, okay hang on so they run and they're getting all this stuff and they get the board and they put the little the girl it the the girl ended up passing away unfortunately, but
01:15:30.90 --> 01:15:32.90 Zero hesitation
01:15:32.90 --> 01:15:34.90 That's that's my wife
01:15:35.14 --> 01:15:37.14 Fucking hero and
01:15:38.10 --> 01:15:43.86 You know she retired from the military last year and is going through
01:15:44.66 --> 01:15:48.58 She's probably gonna get mad at me for saying this but she's going through it a lot of soldiers go through the
01:15:48.58 --> 01:15:54.90 Transition. Oh, you mean the thing we've been talking about for all night and all last podcast
01:15:54.90 --> 01:16:02.82 She just she's just having a tough time freering out who who's a Lanna Gilmore if she's not a soldier and she's a amazing mom
01:16:03.38 --> 01:16:05.38 She's an amazing wife and
01:16:06.18 --> 01:16:10.02 She's an amazing person. It's just in her mind. She needs to find
01:16:10.90 --> 01:16:12.90 The new her and
01:16:12.90 --> 01:16:16.50 You know and I'm trying to help her the best I can but you know
01:16:16.50 --> 01:16:22.02 I can only do so much and at some point she'll figure it out. She's she's coming around pretty good right now
01:16:22.02 --> 01:16:27.62 I think she's she's starting to like volunteer a little bit here and like get out and do some stuff and
01:16:28.10 --> 01:16:32.10 You know, I'm pretty you know, I'm just proud of her you know for the most part. Yeah, you know
01:16:32.82 --> 01:16:35.30 That's one of the things that makes that transition so hard
01:16:36.50 --> 01:16:41.06 Is that you know before I was talking about like combat matters and
01:16:42.74 --> 01:16:45.54 Then beyond that you're doing this thing
01:16:45.54 --> 01:16:51.70 You know for your wife like she's in charge of saving people's lives
01:16:52.02 --> 01:17:00.42 Saving soldiers lives and that's gonna help the strategic mission. I mean what what what what is gonna replace that for her
01:17:02.10 --> 01:17:09.30 And the answer Alana is nothing nothing's gonna replace that yeah, but you know what you don't need to replace it
01:17:09.70 --> 01:17:11.70 You don't need to replace it
01:17:11.70 --> 01:17:19.78 Uh whole stock replace that thing that's a beautiful beautiful experience to have had in your life
01:17:21.54 --> 01:17:24.18 But don't let it turn into a
01:17:24.82 --> 01:17:28.66 Black hole right like like the black hole the massive a black hole is some
01:17:29.22 --> 01:17:34.74 Insane number just like the mass and the and the power of this combat experience is the same thing
01:17:34.74 --> 01:17:40.26 It's this super powerful experience, but don't let it suck all the other experiences away
01:17:40.26 --> 01:17:42.26 Don't let it do that
01:17:42.66 --> 01:17:46.82 Don't let it do that so what's that what's what else?
01:17:47.46 --> 01:17:52.34 What matters now we know what mattered in the past right, but what matters now?
01:17:53.46 --> 01:17:57.38 That's the question and there's so many things. I mean you got two daughters
01:17:57.70 --> 01:18:01.38 You got your dumb ass to take care of and I am dumb
01:18:02.50 --> 01:18:04.50 You tell you
01:18:04.66 --> 01:18:08.34 So what is it one of those things that matters and what's the next mission?
01:18:08.34 --> 01:18:11.54 She's gonna find maybe she's gonna end up being a paramedic maybe she's good, you know who knows
01:18:12.10 --> 01:18:17.22 Maybe she'll end up being an artist maybe she'll end up having her own podcast maybe she'll end up being a painter
01:18:17.22 --> 01:18:21.54 I don't know but what mattered in the past is awesome
01:18:22.34 --> 01:18:27.54 But let's find out what matters now. Yeah, and grab hold of that baby listen listen to jacco now
01:18:29.86 --> 01:18:35.46 Hold on to that thing and let that thing grow yeah let that thing grow let that thing
01:18:35.46 --> 01:18:44.98 Feed off of the past and bring something new something bigger something that happening something that's happening now
01:18:47.94 --> 01:18:50.18 But that's my wife. Yeah, that's awesome
01:18:50.18 --> 01:18:56.10 You should use a damn proud of where I can see you know in your face like I don't have any decorations for saving people
01:18:57.46 --> 01:18:59.46 You know you do I
01:18:59.86 --> 01:19:03.14 You know and you know and I think about
01:19:03.14 --> 01:19:10.18 What I saw I saw a lot of destruction but honestly it was mostly the enemy
01:19:11.06 --> 01:19:16.90 You know that I caused and I'm like it's easy to step over him like he doesn't look like me. He doesn't talk like me. He doesn't dress like me
01:19:18.02 --> 01:19:23.22 I don't even know that you know I didn't know nothing about that guy step over him carry on she rolls up
01:19:24.82 --> 01:19:31.22 Let's just take my case she knows me. I'm joddy. I'm her buddy. We watched a family guy together
01:19:31.22 --> 01:19:36.98 I used to you know her her ex-husband and I used to we're buddies you know like you know all these things and
01:19:37.62 --> 01:19:41.94 And she would whenever she would roll up to a scene it was the cleanup the mess the enemy made of us
01:19:42.82 --> 01:19:48.82 And she knew most were tiny army yeah and our or we're brigade for us is like
01:19:49.46 --> 01:19:52.18 3200 guys maybe maybe
01:19:52.98 --> 01:19:58.58 Maybe 2500 and 2006 so she knew most of the guys that she put in the body bags
01:19:58.58 --> 01:20:01.38 And or like in my case she says
01:20:02.34 --> 01:20:08.58 After they loaded me on the helicopter and it flew away she was just sad because she knew that what I was going home to
01:20:08.90 --> 01:20:14.26 Because of my injuries right she was like she knew more about your future than you did exactly
01:20:14.26 --> 01:20:19.38 She knew what a nightmare you were about to go through she knew what I was and who I was and what I was now
01:20:20.42 --> 01:20:26.50 Going to be like have to become and accept and she says that she said that and she had never said that to me
01:20:26.50 --> 01:20:31.78 And I read it in interview she gave once and she said yeah, I just I was just devastated for him because of
01:20:32.34 --> 01:20:35.94 What he was going to go home to this big tough strong
01:20:36.98 --> 01:20:40.02 proud guy had to go home without feet. She's just like oh
01:20:41.62 --> 01:20:45.46 And I guess she said something like you know if nobody else looks after him I guess I got a
01:20:46.42 --> 01:20:48.42 God damn it she did
01:20:48.42 --> 01:20:54.98 Ha ha next question props to a lot of yeah, you love you baby awesome
01:20:58.34 --> 01:21:00.34 Kind of a
01:21:00.34 --> 01:21:06.74 Next question which I paired these two together because this one relates here to how do you deal with being away from family loved ones
01:21:09.22 --> 01:21:10.82 I'm
01:21:10.82 --> 01:21:16.82 I'm odd I'll always have been I think this might be where I might be a little bit like you
01:21:19.62 --> 01:21:21.62 Do you ever like I just I
01:21:22.98 --> 01:21:24.98 Don't really miss people
01:21:26.90 --> 01:21:32.02 Yes, does that make sense? Yes, you know what I'm saying right I know I can see it okay you know I don't
01:21:32.42 --> 01:21:36.34 Miss people because I know I'm gonna see them even my daughter. I love my daughters
01:21:36.34 --> 01:21:43.46 Love my daughters and I'll walk in the house and they're better than puppies right they jump on me and I get daddy daddy
01:21:43.46 --> 01:21:49.14 It's my the seven-year-old still doesn't I get kisses I get hugs I get where were you you were gone so long
01:21:50.18 --> 01:21:52.18 But like today I haven't spoken to them
01:21:53.70 --> 01:21:56.34 And I don't miss them I know that they're out there
01:21:57.06 --> 01:22:00.58 Like but on a certain level when I do get home
01:22:00.98 --> 01:22:05.06 I'm real happy to be home. Yeah, like you were saying to me on the phone like you just want to get home
01:22:05.06 --> 01:22:07.06 But when I'm away from home
01:22:08.34 --> 01:22:09.94 You're in the game
01:22:09.94 --> 01:22:14.98 Yes, especially for this I guess because I'm here to promote the book and I'm here to hang out with you guys so I'm like
01:22:16.02 --> 01:22:22.10 I'm looking forward and it's like when my dad was crying in the parking lot before I went on my first mission ever
01:22:23.22 --> 01:22:25.22 to me it was like
01:22:25.22 --> 01:22:27.22 What the big deal dude? I'll be back in six months and
01:22:28.58 --> 01:22:30.58 And you know my best my best buddies
01:22:30.58 --> 01:22:35.38 You know the the guys that I was happy didn't die in combat
01:22:35.94 --> 01:22:38.58 I've talked to them every three to six months
01:22:39.78 --> 01:22:49.30 You know I just talked to the leader of that green bra team that I work so much with just the other day after two years of not actually speaking you know a couple messages on Facebook and this
01:22:50.82 --> 01:22:52.82 It's weird for me
01:22:52.82 --> 01:22:54.82 Yeah, I'm very similar
01:22:54.82 --> 01:22:55.86 I don't
01:22:55.86 --> 01:23:02.90 Don't feel the need to continually update people or talk to people and my best example is a guy went through
01:23:02.90 --> 01:23:09.46 Seal training with did three people to do them that sealed team one wasn't training so I wasn't sealed team one and he was my roommate that entire time
01:23:09.46 --> 01:23:10.26 so
01:23:10.26 --> 01:23:14.18 eight years or so we were and we we did everything together
01:23:14.58 --> 01:23:20.10 Drank together hung out together everything we did and I got and then I got moved to Virginia Beach for two years
01:23:20.58 --> 01:23:25.66 Didn't talk to them not one single time not a letter not a phone call nothing came back so
01:23:25.66 --> 01:23:27.66 I was like hey, what's up man? Oh, yeah, hey
01:23:28.22 --> 01:23:33.42 What you want to burger with us you know what I mean? It was just like nothing to write up picked it right up and that's how I always feel
01:23:33.90 --> 01:23:35.42 so
01:23:35.42 --> 01:23:39.02 And I kind of do that with my family at least and you know
01:23:39.02 --> 01:23:41.02 I'm assuming that this person is a guy that's
01:23:42.22 --> 01:23:44.46 Thinking about being on deployment without his family
01:23:45.82 --> 01:23:50.14 And so yeah, and again when I talked about our leaders, I'm gonna compartmentalize and
01:23:51.10 --> 01:23:53.10 Say and I'll tell you this is
01:23:53.10 --> 01:23:55.10 I
01:23:55.10 --> 01:23:59.26 Didn't want to talk to my wife and kids every day
01:24:00.30 --> 01:24:02.30 at all when I was on deployment
01:24:02.62 --> 01:24:06.22 I didn't know what you could do it. I mean if you were if you were on base you could do it
01:24:06.22 --> 01:24:09.90 I mean for those of you that don't know overseas most places overseas right now
01:24:10.14 --> 01:24:13.26 You got internet you got satellite phone you can call home you can
01:24:13.82 --> 01:24:15.82 I did not want to do that
01:24:15.82 --> 01:24:18.86 With my wife and with my family when was your first deployment?
01:24:18.86 --> 01:24:23.90 Uh, 2003 2004 that was your first one ever oh no no no I my first appointment was in
01:24:25.34 --> 01:24:28.38 Yeah, mine was a co-savo 99
01:24:29.90 --> 01:24:32.70 You called home on a you had a one phone
01:24:33.42 --> 01:24:37.82 It was seven second delay and you got 15 minutes a week
01:24:38.38 --> 01:24:41.10 Maybe it was four second delay. I just know what it like it sucked
01:24:42.22 --> 01:24:45.26 There was no such thing as email email and 99
01:24:45.26 --> 01:24:50.30 First of all, I didn't have an email and so there's one guy on base who is the geek
01:24:50.70 --> 01:24:54.54 And he would go back to the main camp where they had the intern intern interweb
01:24:55.18 --> 01:25:00.54 And you had to give them your email and the password and he would download your messages on to a CD ROM
01:25:01.66 --> 01:25:04.86 Come back with it and print it off on the clerks computer for you
01:25:06.70 --> 01:25:13.58 I wonder if our type of thinking about it is a is a response from the fact that we just didn't have it
01:25:13.58 --> 01:25:18.30 Yeah, the first time and then by between 99 and 2006 and 2006
01:25:18.30 --> 01:25:23.42 I had a sat phone in my pocket for every everywhere I went I could have called home all day every day
01:25:24.22 --> 01:25:27.98 But I didn't yeah because I was like well first of all it's a treat and
01:25:28.54 --> 01:25:33.42 Second of all I got a lot of work to do and I can't be worrying about I went time
01:25:33.42 --> 01:25:37.34 I was on the phone and a shot went over my head. Hey dad. I got to go
01:25:37.34 --> 01:25:44.14 Hey, you know and he's and then I think you're your guy Chris Kyle in his book
01:25:44.14 --> 01:25:48.94 He talks about being on the phone and then a gunfight starts yeah and his wife listens to the gunfight
01:25:48.94 --> 01:25:51.74 Because he forgot to hang up the phone are you kidding me
01:25:52.94 --> 01:25:54.94 Putting your family through that
01:25:55.10 --> 01:26:01.66 But I think maybe our our situation is that we came from the generation where that just wasn't an option anyway
01:26:01.66 --> 01:26:06.94 So I would love to talk to some of the newer guys. Yeah about this about this subject
01:26:07.98 --> 01:26:14.22 I did two I did three ship board deployments as a seal so we used to deploy on ships and the first one
01:26:14.22 --> 01:26:18.54 I went on the reading you have internet so it was old school you'd get mail
01:26:19.74 --> 01:26:22.62 Written mail but that was the norm once every
01:26:23.26 --> 01:26:26.86 30 days or 35 days it'd be like mail call if we're gonna be all excited
01:26:26.86 --> 01:26:31.98 But yeah, I think that that definitely conditions you to
01:26:33.02 --> 01:26:39.82 Not be addicted to having that and I don't think you're helping the home front either to call every day and say I miss you so much
01:26:39.82 --> 01:26:44.78 I can't wait to I don't know if it helps the home front either. I think it actually is a little bit painful for the home front
01:26:44.78 --> 01:26:48.78 I was talking to one of the wives the other day. I have some of our guys that are deployed
01:26:49.58 --> 01:26:51.58 Don't get mad at me ladies
01:26:51.98 --> 01:26:55.18 But I'm just a lot of ladies that are deployed to each other. No days sure
01:26:55.18 --> 01:27:00.70 But I was talking to a wife of a guy. I know and she says they haven't heard from someone so for
01:27:01.74 --> 01:27:03.26 For like four days
01:27:03.26 --> 01:27:05.26 I'm like huh
01:27:05.26 --> 01:27:07.26 I'm like he's probably on top like
01:27:07.66 --> 01:27:11.66 You know what he does for a living you know exactly what he does for a living
01:27:12.22 --> 01:27:14.22 Ops can take a while he's like yeah, but
01:27:15.10 --> 01:27:16.86 Usually he gets back to me and I'm like
01:27:17.50 --> 01:27:19.50 Obviously he's on a long-up
01:27:19.90 --> 01:27:22.94 But they're conditioned now to always hear back from you
01:27:22.94 --> 01:27:30.14 You know what you you talked about this in your book which is life's gonna go on yeah, and I think that that's something to that will help
01:27:31.10 --> 01:27:32.86 You know if you're like for this guy
01:27:33.02 --> 01:27:36.06 That's gonna be gone for a long time and how's he gonna deal with it?
01:27:36.46 --> 01:27:39.18 Except the fact that life's gonna go on and just be cool with that
01:27:39.90 --> 01:27:46.30 Things are gonna change the things we get remodeled. This is gonna be some new rugs in the house. Yeah, it's gonna be a new piece of furniture
01:27:46.54 --> 01:27:51.50 The fridge might break and she'll go get a new one exactly and there's nothing you can do about it
01:27:51.50 --> 01:27:56.30 You can just be cool with it. Yeah, if you don't like the color she picks say thanks for getting the new fridge
01:27:56.86 --> 01:28:02.06 Thanks for taking care of that because I was busy doing protecting freedoms and democracy in the world
01:28:03.82 --> 01:28:05.82 All right
01:28:06.14 --> 01:28:07.66 Next one
01:28:07.66 --> 01:28:10.94 What are your workout slash training methods?
01:28:12.86 --> 01:28:15.50 Usually make it up as I'm walking into the knolk
01:28:16.86 --> 01:28:20.30 Right now because I am body building and I'm going like
01:28:20.30 --> 01:28:22.30 I'm doing
01:28:22.30 --> 01:28:25.66 Might be here in from echo here in a second. He's the big-time body builder
01:28:26.38 --> 01:28:32.62 You bodybuild no no, okay, so I've worked out since you know I was 16 with weights, right?
01:28:32.62 --> 01:28:35.98 But I always so my first mission in Afghanistan
01:28:37.02 --> 01:28:40.94 Because I was a driver slash bodyguard and remember animal stack
01:28:41.74 --> 01:28:48.94 Yes, that supplement which was basically steroids. Yes, so we would order we ordered a shit ton of animal stack and
01:28:48.94 --> 01:28:52.22 Because we had a lot of downtime we watched
01:28:53.50 --> 01:28:56.86 You know like 24 the series on DVD and we worked out
01:28:56.86 --> 01:29:05.98 I came home like bench benching like whatever four plates aside is dead lifting like I was like huge we looked awesome. What did you weigh?
01:29:07.34 --> 01:29:12.06 240 or something crazy like that and and then I tried to get behind my sniper rifle
01:29:12.54 --> 01:29:16.38 Because I was not operating as a sniper, right? I was like, oh god, okay
01:29:16.38 --> 01:29:23.34 Couldn't too big tried tried rocking through my rucksack on and tried to go up a hill. Oh my god
01:29:23.90 --> 01:29:29.42 Oh, I got so I just slim back down. I've realized I'm like, oh being a meathead is not conducive to being a sniper
01:29:30.78 --> 01:29:34.22 So I always tried to tailor my body around being a sniper
01:29:34.78 --> 01:29:36.78 Especially after that and
01:29:37.58 --> 01:29:38.78 But now
01:29:38.78 --> 01:29:44.30 I like I said I'm gonna be 40 in January. It's gonna be 10 year anniversary getting blown up in January
01:29:44.30 --> 01:29:51.34 And I wanted to quit drinking and I needed a new goal to move towards so I said I'm gonna get into body building
01:29:51.74 --> 01:29:54.70 And if you know anything about body building, I don't want to look like fill Heath
01:29:55.90 --> 01:29:57.74 I want to look like
01:29:57.74 --> 01:29:59.98 Arnold when he was in the 70s
01:30:00.22 --> 01:30:03.50 63 when they still look human so you picked a realistic goal
01:30:04.22 --> 01:30:08.30 Yeah, something something where I might not need supplementation from another country
01:30:08.30 --> 01:30:12.70 And not that there's anything wrong with it whatever man of to me
01:30:14.22 --> 01:30:19.02 My my view on that stuff is if it gets you to where you want to be and you're not hurt in anybody who cares
01:30:19.50 --> 01:30:21.74 Right your body do whatever you want with it
01:30:23.42 --> 01:30:25.42 So but but
01:30:25.42 --> 01:30:30.38 For body building you look good so I'm doing the physique class which means you wear board shorts
01:30:30.78 --> 01:30:35.66 And you don't necessarily have a routine but they tell you how to pose like they like I we want to see your abs
01:30:35.66 --> 01:30:41.74 You want to see your glue, whatever whatever so you kind of just stand a certain way and and I take direction well
01:30:42.22 --> 01:30:45.66 Right, I'll be on the parade square basically so you look good
01:30:45.90 --> 01:30:47.90 But you're not really good for much
01:30:47.90 --> 01:30:51.26 When you're in that condition so I want the picture of me with a six pack
01:30:52.06 --> 01:30:54.86 I'll be 40 I'll have a glass of water it'll all go away
01:30:55.82 --> 01:31:00.62 And then I'll celebrate the 10 year anniversary of getting blown up and I'll least I'll know that I've got like
01:31:01.02 --> 01:31:03.50 Somewhat of the type of body I used to have back
01:31:03.50 --> 01:31:12.22 Okay, all that being said my training now is being directed by my buddy Nick and I do whatever he tells me and right now it's
01:31:15.02 --> 01:31:21.26 Chests and arms one day back and shoulders another day and legs another day. Can you squat?
01:31:21.82 --> 01:31:23.02 No
01:31:23.02 --> 01:31:27.26 How do you what sucks because that was my favorite exercise of course of course
01:31:27.26 --> 01:31:35.26 But there's got to be some like modified I do a hacksquat. Okay, there you go. You know the machine yeah, so I recently discovered it
01:31:35.82 --> 01:31:37.10 Like in the last
01:31:37.42 --> 01:31:40.38 six weeks I just covered this machine hacksquat
01:31:42.30 --> 01:31:44.30 But before I was doing leg press and
01:31:45.74 --> 01:31:50.46 Curls I can't really do extensions because the because the stumps are different length
01:31:51.18 --> 01:31:55.66 And where the pad rests across my shins it puts too much torque on my stumps
01:31:55.66 --> 01:31:56.46 Right
01:31:56.46 --> 01:31:59.02 So but then I found this hacksquat thing and it's
01:31:59.58 --> 01:32:05.42 It's made all the difference so I you know slap as much weight on it as I can stand and and I just squat
01:32:05.98 --> 01:32:09.18 Because it's almost like a squat yeah, it's pretty close, but I'm supported
01:32:09.66 --> 01:32:12.14 So my wife's a land is noticed at firmer ass
01:32:12.70 --> 01:32:19.26 There you go, I think like that, you know and so anyway my my routine is just that and you know the food is
01:32:19.82 --> 01:32:21.82 I'm a big baby when it comes to food
01:32:21.82 --> 01:32:26.78 I've never eaten my vegetables and I don't care what Nick says or what my mommy used to say
01:32:26.78 --> 01:32:28.78 I'm not gonna eat them that's what my food eats
01:32:30.78 --> 01:32:35.74 You know I'm a meat potatoes guy pretty much and that's about it. I'm the worst
01:32:37.18 --> 01:32:41.50 Eater of food like fear factor Joe Rogan's old show
01:32:42.06 --> 01:32:49.98 I would be the worst contestant. I would be such a lute. Well, I might be able to pull it off because I've eaten some pretty gross things because I had to right but
01:32:49.98 --> 01:32:56.70 Um like I just don't like a lot of foods. I'm the same yeah, and I don't care what anyone tells oh
01:32:57.02 --> 01:33:01.66 Come on you just gotta try it. I'm not I'm not trying it. Yeah, I just smelled it. I you want to throw up
01:33:01.66 --> 01:33:05.90 I just looked at it. It's something I don't want my mouth how about that? Okay
01:33:06.22 --> 01:33:12.30 How about you just get me the steak with ironies spices or sauces on it like I asked for and the plain potato
01:33:12.30 --> 01:33:15.82 I want next to it and I'll throw some butter and some pepper on that bad boy
01:33:15.82 --> 01:33:19.50 That sounds like a good one. That's like that's what food tastes like and that's what I love
01:33:20.54 --> 01:33:25.02 You know, a lot of makes fun of me because my favorite ice cream vanilla. I'm like my life is exciting enough
01:33:26.30 --> 01:33:27.66 I don't need no
01:33:27.66 --> 01:33:31.74 Strawberry sprinkle bubble gum ice cream spring my vanilla
01:33:32.06 --> 01:33:35.34 It'd be a brownie on the side. Yeah, I don't know. I I do go with the
01:33:35.90 --> 01:33:39.34 Mid-Chocolate chip milkshake, but oh, maybe really yeah
01:33:39.34 --> 01:33:43.18 Chock it's what about what what so you just literally see your like steak and potatoes
01:33:43.18 --> 01:33:47.10 Do you are when you go to this body building yeah, you're gonna have to drop a bunch of fat
01:33:47.66 --> 01:33:49.66 Yeah, so I'm dropping the fat
01:33:49.66 --> 01:33:54.14 What do you got you got that by diet? That's diet. So what are you gonna do when it what do you know what next
01:33:54.14 --> 01:33:57.42 Gonna put you on for a program for that we start that next week?
01:33:58.62 --> 01:34:01.42 You think he's gonna go like no carbs all fat
01:34:01.98 --> 01:34:07.10 He's he's a proponent of the old school body building where you never want to be in katoces really
01:34:08.14 --> 01:34:09.82 But he's a body builder
01:34:09.82 --> 01:34:15.58 I want to get him to read look at the physique stuff yeah because you know if you read Arnold's new
01:34:16.54 --> 01:34:22.14 Update modern book on body building or encyclopedia of body building which he rewrote in the 90s
01:34:22.70 --> 01:34:25.50 They still went by the whole fuel the
01:34:26.30 --> 01:34:29.74 muscle with the carb thing right, but they look amazing
01:34:30.30 --> 01:34:35.10 So they might have been on to something because you gotta think about they were on the juice
01:34:35.10 --> 01:34:40.14 Well Arnold's most those guys. It's a seat in the 70s. They weren't no juicux
01:34:40.14 --> 01:34:46.22 We you're completely wrong those guys were absolutely juicing a hundred percent in the 70s
01:34:46.22 --> 01:34:49.02 It's a 70s absolutely and it wasn't a not like today
01:34:49.82 --> 01:34:52.70 Not like today, but Arnold was absolutely
01:34:53.34 --> 01:35:00.22 100 percent on steroids as were all those guys back in the day and they weren't illegal yet
01:35:00.22 --> 01:35:04.94 But they also put in the book he says he didn't really they didn't really know what they were like their effect
01:35:04.94 --> 01:35:08.46 They knew they helped. Oh, but they didn't have it down to a sign
01:35:08.46 --> 01:35:09.98 You know what their effect was?
01:35:10.46 --> 01:35:17.42 27 in charms or whatever. Yeah, they didn't have it to a science, but they were taken they were absolutely a hundred percent on the sauce
01:35:17.98 --> 01:35:22.46 And it wasn't illegal at the time. No, they yeah, that's right. Yeah, so that might be
01:35:23.42 --> 01:35:28.78 Where that idea comes from of hey they weren't on anything they were absolutely and on on
01:35:28.78 --> 01:35:33.34 So yeah, so Nick we we yoked Nick yeah, they did it look pretty pretty pretty
01:35:33.34 --> 01:35:37.82 You you said that earlier. They like oh, you know, it would be natural like sports and they grew in the 70s
01:35:38.22 --> 01:35:41.82 But they still looked human is my point. They looked more human than they do now
01:35:42.06 --> 01:35:44.30 Like did you have you watched generation iron?
01:35:44.62 --> 01:35:53.90 Yeah, I mean what is now or just mutants? Yeah, and that's great. Good for them amazing, but I I can't I need to lose weight to be on prosthetics like I can't be putting on that
01:35:53.90 --> 01:35:55.90 Yeah, yeah, so next thing is
01:35:55.90 --> 01:36:04.46 Catosis is bad because you risk losing muscle mass and that's kind of counter to the whole bodybuilding thing
01:36:05.10 --> 01:36:10.38 So the transitional period you do risk that if you're not in ketosis
01:36:10.38 --> 01:36:15.82 So there's the trend and it varies from person or person so some people they go through they switch over ketosis right away
01:36:15.82 --> 01:36:17.42 Yeah, and you know
01:36:17.82 --> 01:36:22.38 The risk you know, they don't they don't lose up, but some guys it takes weeks and yeah, you
01:36:22.38 --> 01:36:28.86 Yeah, yeah, like I I'm not that big yet at all, but I mean we're still we got to November and
01:36:30.14 --> 01:36:33.02 As long as it's you know, it's probably be a protein heavy
01:36:34.62 --> 01:36:41.18 With the normal carbs rice and potato sweet potatoes stuff like that like a little bit of olive oil and
01:36:41.18 --> 01:36:43.66 Coat oil and stuff you just go lots of fat
01:36:45.02 --> 01:36:47.90 Pretty good amount of protein yeah no carbohydrates
01:36:47.90 --> 01:36:54.62 Yeah, yeah, no sorry, but this is my thing this is after the bodybuilding. Yes, that's how I eat anyway
01:36:54.62 --> 01:37:02.06 Okay, I do love me some pasta though and a lananai will crush a pizza like work for yeah
01:37:02.06 --> 01:37:03.90 That's our thing Friday night
01:37:03.90 --> 01:37:06.54 We get a pizza we rent a movie on iTunes
01:37:06.54 --> 01:37:10.38 You know gotta get the occasional pizza. It's understood. Yeah, it's a taste good. Yeah
01:37:11.82 --> 01:37:13.34 But occasional
01:37:13.34 --> 01:37:19.98 Yeah, but my my general rule for myself is that it's it's it's usually a high protein like low carb diet
01:37:20.54 --> 01:37:27.66 And if and I like to eat like if I'm not eating I like to be taking like a shake or something like every three or four hours
01:37:28.46 --> 01:37:33.90 I just try to intermittent fasting. Yes. Yeah, I'm not that it's okay. I don't mind it
01:37:34.70 --> 01:37:37.10 I like it as far as convenience goes
01:37:38.38 --> 01:37:42.54 I'm not eating today. Yeah, I'm gonna work more. Yeah, and I know I did
01:37:42.54 --> 01:37:45.98 I did a 48 hour fast a little while ago just out of randomness
01:37:45.98 --> 01:37:48.54 Like one day I worked all day or traveled or something
01:37:48.54 --> 01:37:53.02 I didn't eat in the next morning. I worked out right away and then I had a phone call and then I did something and I was like
01:37:53.18 --> 01:37:55.18 Dang it's been 24 hours
01:37:55.18 --> 01:38:01.02 I'm just gonna throw 48 on this thing. So I went 48. It was no fact so it's a use of zero intake
01:38:01.02 --> 01:38:08.06 I have zero in take water just water. Drink water and you know what? I did squats road jiu-jitsu both days. It was no factor
01:38:08.70 --> 01:38:10.70 Yeah, I did
01:38:10.70 --> 01:38:13.58 I did a 48 hour but I had coffee
01:38:15.26 --> 01:38:20.78 Did you feel alright? It's fine. I felt fine. I like I had a little bit of tightness for a bit
01:38:21.42 --> 01:38:26.62 But they whatever like in the stomach. Yeah, I'll tell you once you read the forgotten high lander
01:38:27.18 --> 01:38:31.42 Or any of these books wrong talk about these people that are just going months without food
01:38:31.74 --> 01:38:34.54 Or to get the people up in North Korea eating
01:38:34.54 --> 01:38:39.74 Uh, what is it? Root and salt water soup
01:38:40.86 --> 01:38:47.82 That's your meal. God. Oh, we do we found some weeds out there. Do you ever have the dichotomy in your mind of
01:38:48.62 --> 01:38:51.58 If I was a caveman, I'd be fine
01:38:52.06 --> 01:38:58.46 But then you realize it's 2016 and why are you depriving yourself of something or why aren't you taking full advantage of the
01:38:58.46 --> 01:39:04.06 Technology available to you whether it's protein shakes or or supplements like on it
01:39:04.94 --> 01:39:09.18 Like you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, I agree with you on those points
01:39:09.18 --> 01:39:13.90 But a lot of people think that the benefits of 2016 are
01:39:15.02 --> 01:39:17.02 A Twinkie
01:39:17.02 --> 01:39:22.70 Oh, yeah, no, I was back up a table chips or whatever and that's I was picking my kids up from school yesterday
01:39:23.42 --> 01:39:25.58 And I was sitting in the office waiting for them to come down
01:39:25.58 --> 01:39:30.46 And then there is the C. Young fella sitting over there by the next the principal's office eating his lunch
01:39:31.02 --> 01:39:35.34 I assume because he can't be trusted around other kids in lunch or so I don't know what what the deal is
01:39:36.46 --> 01:39:41.74 And he pulled a Twinkie out of his lunch. I almost fell over
01:39:42.70 --> 01:39:46.46 Who gives their kid a Twinkie at lunch? Yeah, and it's fun
01:39:46.46 --> 01:39:50.22 That's supposed to be Christmas. Yeah, but when we maybe when we when I was a kid
01:39:50.22 --> 01:39:54.70 I don't know about you when I was a kid. Oh, you're thirsty. Here's a coke. Oh, you're still thirsty. Here's another
01:39:54.70 --> 01:40:01.66 Oh, you're hungry potato chips like my mom would read the ingredients on stuff and be like oh, there's way too much sugar in this shit
01:40:01.66 --> 01:40:07.02 Oh my god, Coco puffs for my birthday my parents. Oh, I was I was like Krispies and corn flakes
01:40:07.02 --> 01:40:10.22 Arrest the time. Yeah, thank you mom. Yeah, I was lucky charms
01:40:11.18 --> 01:40:14.94 I mean we just ate and it wasn't like my parents said oh, this might be bad
01:40:14.94 --> 01:40:20.94 That was just what yeah, but bought yeah when I was a kid. No, my mom was on top of that stuff and I have that too
01:40:20.94 --> 01:40:23.74 Like this sugar and like a loaf of bread now
01:40:23.74 --> 01:40:26.78 Yeah, I give my daughters a two slice
01:40:27.66 --> 01:40:34.70 Sandwich that's like 12 grams of sugar if they eat the whole thing. I'm like why is there sugar in the bread and and
01:40:35.42 --> 01:40:41.66 Like I'll be I'm not I'm like an 80 20 guy whatever that you know the 80% like 80% of time
01:40:41.98 --> 01:40:47.02 I pretty good 20% of the time. I'm getting after some crap, right? I'm a lot like that

01:43:35.06 --> 01:43:38.06 Coconut oil makes a little bit of just
01:43:38.30 --> 01:43:42.86 How about not heard this on your podcast, but I don't know if I'm so on it coconut oil by the way
01:43:42.86 --> 01:43:47.26 That I love on it been using on it before was called on it, but why they're coconut oil
01:43:47.90 --> 01:43:53.14 That's the one he does. Yeah, it's the virgin coconut oil. Yeah, it's really high quality
01:43:53.14 --> 01:44:00.50 Coconut oil which is what I do and actually it's good to in supporting on it. I actually do support this podcast
01:44:03.14 --> 01:44:06.66 Yeah, so whoever asked about nutrition it's
01:44:08.10 --> 01:44:13.38 Oh, you know what I will that was me that asked about nutrition wasn't that the question was about working out
01:44:13.54 --> 01:44:17.38 We kind of delved into oh new tradition. Okay, well, jocco
01:44:17.38 --> 01:44:25.54 The other thing my gut Scott destroyed by the antibiotics in my recovery and it took me
01:44:26.82 --> 01:44:30.66 Figuring it out on my own like why was I constantly having like diarrhea?
01:44:30.66 --> 01:44:36.98 Why was I constantly not like just an upset stomach and then I started reading okay? What causes it? Do I have IBS?
01:44:37.62 --> 01:44:38.34 blah blah blah
01:44:38.34 --> 01:44:42.82 Oh, no, I was on six months worth of of antibiotics killed everything in your good
01:44:42.82 --> 01:44:50.02 And then I'm I've had staff infections like I went out of year one year where I had like four staff infections in my stumps in a row
01:44:50.74 --> 01:44:55.86 And it just like just hand you know just hammers because I was getting sick and and like so I'm like what's wrong?
01:44:56.26 --> 01:44:58.98 And then I really oh okay, so now every morning
01:44:58.98 --> 01:45:03.70 I like I keep a bottle of kombucha in the fridge every morning. I just shake it up take a swig
01:45:03.70 --> 01:45:13.94 I have a probiotic pill that I take with that swig and that's made a huge difference and and I'm always seeking out different ways to keep the the gut flora
01:45:14.66 --> 01:45:17.22 Happy you know, so the like apple cider vinegar
01:45:18.58 --> 01:45:23.86 Apple cider vinegar and kombucha and the probiotics those three additions. I've made a huge difference
01:45:24.90 --> 01:45:31.22 In my in my system like my immune system alone and then I like I just started jack and massive amounts of vitamin D
01:45:31.22 --> 01:45:38.74 E and see into my body and then I've kept a real close eye on like so as a kid
01:45:39.30 --> 01:45:41.94 Like you know when we were eating lunch, I didn't want onions or mushrooms
01:45:43.06 --> 01:45:48.98 Because as a kid I didn't like them and I found out later as an adult while I'm actually slightly allergic to them
01:45:49.78 --> 01:45:52.58 So whatever your body tells you pay real close attention
01:45:52.98 --> 01:45:58.10 You know because nothing will screw with your gains or your work at routine more than feeling like shit
01:45:58.10 --> 01:46:05.94 Right and and so if you eat something and you feel like shit after you know pay attention to that
01:46:06.50 --> 01:46:10.66 Because that can take a lot of energy away from your workout and just from your date
01:46:11.46 --> 01:46:17.06 You know like you go roll into work with a headache because you ate something that you're actually allergic to like that can really mess with your mood
01:46:17.62 --> 01:46:24.50 So I pay super that's so one of the reasons why I'm such a basic eater is because I've learned that that's how I feel best
01:46:24.50 --> 01:46:29.94 And I function best when I have minimum sub like minimum like additions to like
01:46:30.58 --> 01:46:35.70 You know when you go to the get breakfast right nothing better than bacon and eggs in the morning
01:46:36.26 --> 01:46:39.62 Until they bring your home fries and they're covered with paprika
01:46:40.18 --> 01:46:47.06 Montreal spice shit all over them and and I'm like why would you do that to my potatoes?
01:46:47.46 --> 01:46:51.30 Potatoes are delicious with a little bit of bread butter and and salt
01:46:51.30 --> 01:46:53.30 All of they come like that
01:46:55.54 --> 01:46:59.22 Could I have some without it? Oh yeah, okay, you know what keep it potatoes
01:47:00.18 --> 01:47:03.62 Because I've learned that if I have that go in my system
01:47:03.62 --> 01:47:08.82 I'll spend a good half hour on the can and that's time. I don't can afford
01:47:09.46 --> 01:47:16.66 So if anyone is like you know when you're a big part of your routine is is the fact that you have to have the energy and like
01:47:16.66 --> 01:47:24.18 Just not feel like shit when you when you go into the gym. Yeah, so that's why by the way just so everybody knows the
01:47:24.90 --> 01:47:30.50 probiotics and there's there's bacteria in your stomach that's supposed to be there. That's good for you
01:47:30.50 --> 01:47:32.50 Yeah, and that's what Jody's talking about
01:47:32.74 --> 01:47:40.42 That's why he drinks kombucha and has the probiotic pill because it keeps those things alive and what he's referring to earlier in that
01:47:40.42 --> 01:47:47.14 The when you take antibiotics. Yeah, it actually kills all that bacteria and then that makes your stomach not be all the time
01:47:47.14 --> 01:47:49.14 That's why they came out with the
01:47:49.54 --> 01:47:51.54 The yogurt a few years ago
01:47:51.54 --> 01:47:53.54 The good whatever it was called
01:47:54.82 --> 01:47:56.82 Yeah, and
01:47:56.82 --> 01:48:00.10 I don't know there is that yogurt and they started selling it because it over a planish year
01:48:00.74 --> 01:48:03.46 You're good flora. Yeah, whatever whatever
01:48:04.26 --> 01:48:06.26 Yeah
01:48:07.30 --> 01:48:08.66 All right
01:48:08.66 --> 01:48:10.98 If you're more it go. We've got one more question
01:48:14.98 --> 01:48:16.98 Do you ever have doubts
01:48:18.10 --> 01:48:20.10 If so how do you handle them
01:48:23.22 --> 01:48:25.22 Yeah, I talked about the doubt I had
01:48:26.42 --> 01:48:28.42 Answering that second question
01:48:28.42 --> 01:48:30.42 um
01:48:30.42 --> 01:48:37.70 If you don't have any doubt I'm gonna be real suspect of you as a person
01:48:38.74 --> 01:48:47.22 So do we all have doubts hey hey folks sorry to break it to Jocco occasionally has doubts he'll never admit it right but
01:48:48.82 --> 01:48:55.94 Douts are part of being human and if you're not doubting yourself you're not challenging yourself either
01:48:55.94 --> 01:49:04.50 I believe this is just what I think so I try to approach my doubts head on unflinching
01:49:05.78 --> 01:49:10.34 You know did I have doubt this third time I got sent into battle school?
01:49:11.70 --> 01:49:14.10 Yeah big time but
01:49:17.06 --> 01:49:20.98 Put on the best uniform put on you know getting the best shape
01:49:20.98 --> 01:49:28.98 Polish your boots the highest standard be prepared to get shit on and and and bulldog your way through
01:49:29.86 --> 01:49:33.38 And smile while you're eating that shit sandwich you know like the doubt is
01:49:38.74 --> 01:49:43.54 You ever heard that like you ever talked to someone and they talk about what they want they really want to be doing
01:49:43.54 --> 01:49:47.62 Okay, so I have a I have a buddy of mine. He's a cop, but he really wants to sell t-shirts
01:49:47.62 --> 01:49:50.90 And he's like yeah, I know I'm just waiting
01:49:50.90 --> 01:49:56.90 I'm what there's you know there's a time there's a time he even made a t-shirt for me and he's probably gonna listen to this and he knows who he is
01:49:57.62 --> 01:50:03.38 And bro, I told you this at the time he said oh, yeah, let's say in a contract for 12 months and this I'm like you know why don't
01:50:04.58 --> 01:50:10.82 Six months tops and you know if that and he's like why what's the matter? I'm like why just I just don't think you're gonna
01:50:11.86 --> 01:50:13.86 This is it this is where you're are
01:50:13.86 --> 01:50:15.46 He's like why and I'm like
01:50:15.46 --> 01:50:19.14 Because you're not putting the f like you're cop. You're not a t-shirt seller
01:50:20.34 --> 01:50:25.14 And he's he you see he's doubting himself to take that leap, you know
01:50:25.38 --> 01:50:30.98 Did I have a doubt when I put my name in for the election? Hell yeah, I did I've never been a politician
01:50:31.38 --> 01:50:33.38 I was a gunfighter. I was a sniper
01:50:34.34 --> 01:50:36.02 But the
01:50:36.02 --> 01:50:38.02 I deal with doubt by dealing with the situation
01:50:40.26 --> 01:50:44.18 Does that make sense? Yeah, because I want to know that I can
01:50:44.18 --> 01:50:48.26 A get through this through it and if I fail I fail. It's
01:50:49.30 --> 01:50:51.54 Hey man, I fail all the time. I failed
01:50:52.50 --> 01:50:56.34 Reading your book, you know, I failed making to the airport and time yesterday, but
01:50:58.26 --> 01:51:03.46 And I have doubt all the time, but I also have enough confidence in myself that I'm
01:51:04.82 --> 01:51:06.82 willing to try almost anything
01:51:08.02 --> 01:51:11.22 And I don't know if that's really the the question that was asked
01:51:11.22 --> 01:51:13.78 But the answer is the same because
01:51:15.06 --> 01:51:17.86 Fear is the thing that holds you back from almost anything in your life
01:51:18.26 --> 01:51:24.18 Was I nervous when I put my hand up to volunteer to go on sniper course? Hell yeah, I was but where did I want to be?
01:51:24.74 --> 01:51:26.74 I want to be on sniper course
01:51:27.86 --> 01:51:32.26 It was I nervous the first time I was in charge of a sniper team going into combat
01:51:32.82 --> 01:51:35.70 Uh-huh, but guess what there is nowhere else I want to be
01:51:37.30 --> 01:51:39.86 doubt is your doubt is your mind to telling you
01:51:39.86 --> 01:51:42.82 You know, to think about the things you need to think about anyway
01:51:43.78 --> 01:51:47.06 Right like the doubt is there for a reason it's the self preservation mechanism
01:51:47.86 --> 01:51:54.34 And you need to use that doubt to put the thoughts in your mind to visualize the successful outcome
01:51:55.54 --> 01:51:57.54 Like we talked about earlier visualization
01:51:58.50 --> 01:52:02.98 You know, I I picture failure all the time and then I picture how will I deal with it?
01:52:04.74 --> 01:52:06.74 You know, doubt
01:52:06.74 --> 01:52:11.78 doubt to me is just a question to ponder and then move on
01:52:13.62 --> 01:52:16.02 You know, so that's that's how I do it
01:52:18.26 --> 01:52:20.26 I'm gonna say for me I
01:52:22.58 --> 01:52:26.18 Agreed the doubt is really how I know
01:52:27.30 --> 01:52:31.70 That I'm pushing myself into a zone that I'm not used to
01:52:33.94 --> 01:52:35.94 but
01:52:35.94 --> 01:52:37.94 the enemy
01:52:39.46 --> 01:52:41.46 I respect my doubts
01:52:42.66 --> 01:52:46.82 I'm not afraid of them, but I respect them. I'm gonna watch them
01:52:48.42 --> 01:52:50.42 I'm gonna listen to them
01:52:52.42 --> 01:52:55.22 I'm gonna understand my doubts
01:52:57.38 --> 01:53:02.34 But I'm not gonna be afraid of them and I'm gonna destroy them
01:53:02.34 --> 01:53:04.34 I
01:53:05.46 --> 01:53:07.46 It jails when he talks like that
01:53:10.10 --> 01:53:12.10 I think that's
01:53:12.26 --> 01:53:14.26 About all we've got for tonight
