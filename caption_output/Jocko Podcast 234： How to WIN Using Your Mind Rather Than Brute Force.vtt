00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jocco podcast number 234 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So I was working with some echelon front clients the other day talking about leadership.

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And I was talking about the minimum use of force. Have you heard that phrase before?

4
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Yes, that's the half.

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So we talk about it from sort of a combatives, a tactical perspective, but I was talking about it from a leadership perspective.

6
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Meaning that you want to lead.

7
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You want to lead most of the time with a minimum use of force.

8
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So I want to do as little as I can to make you do what I want you to do. That's a good rule of thumb to lead with.

9
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I was also thinking and this is you might, I don't know if you're going to find this funny, you might.

10
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I was thinking about leaders being legit.

11
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Have you noticed I used the term legit?

12
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Yes, I used it more now.

13
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You've acquired it.

14
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I've acquired it, yes.

15
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And we know what it means, right?

16
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We use the term to mean like that's cool, but it's a little bit stronger, right?

17
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And it means kind of approved.

18
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But then I was thinking about the source of that word, legitimate, because once again, I was talking about leaders being legit and actually beyond that,

19
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
leaders being legitimate leaders, think about that, right?

20
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Think about the difference in your mind when you think of a legitimate leader or someone that's an illegitimate leader.

21
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
There's a huge difference because when a leader is viewed as illegitimate, then they're not respected.

22
00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:03.000
They're not listened to. If someone gets put new position, because they're the boss's favorite or because they backstab someone, right to get into that, to get that promotion,

23
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000
they're not going to be considered legitimate, a legitimate leader and that hurts their ability to lead.

24
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So as I was thinking about these two things, the men are a mucyphorce and legitimacy.

25
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And I recognize both those thoughts in my head from the counter insurgency manual, FM3, tact 24.

26
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Now, here's a little history behind this manual.

27
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
When I arrived in Ramadi, this is the manual that I read when I arrived in Ramadi.

28
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So what happened was I arrived in Ramadi, I went to an intel briefing, during the intel briefing, there was this massive link diagram of all these bad guys, a bunch of them connected, how they were connected, who they were connected to.

29
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Some of the bad guys have little slat red slashes through them, maybe killed or a little green slash through them, they've been captured.

30
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.000
But the thing is this massive link diagram didn't really look all that much different as the link diagram that I had left in Baghdad two and a half years prior.

31
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So in my mind, I kind of realized, wait a second, of course, still doing the same thing and things don't really look all that different, this isn't good and well it seems like we're losing.

32
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So I don't know what necessarily thing triggered my brain to go and read the counter insurgency manual.

33
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I must have seen something I used to read all these and still do, I'd read these sort of military websites and military news and those kind of things and somewhere in there, I had seen that this new, this new field manual is coming out.

34
00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I've been written by General Patreus and General Matas, both of those guys need no introduction, both incredible leaders, very, very well known inside the military when I was in and now both of them are well known outside the military.

35
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Reading this, so I went and googled it on the regular internet and so now this is like May, yeah, this is May of 2006.

36
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And I'm trying to remember, I don't think I saw the whole completed manual.

37
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I think I saw, I think I saw chapters of it and I did a little research and it turns out that they did, they had sort of assembled the initial chapters and released them as quick as they could just to get this information out there.

38
00:04:41.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And when I read it, it definitely shaped the way I thought about the battle of Ramadi. It shaped the way that tasked you to bruiser could operate in the battle of Ramadi and really ended up shaping the way I think about a lot of different things about leadership and business and the teams and and life.

39
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And so I actually dug around the internet and I found one of these early versions. So one of the versions that I found of this, it's it says on it FM3, tech 24.

40
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And it's June 2006. That's when this, this is the final draft. So I think I think the thing I read was probably just a little bit earlier, probably one of the few chapters released and also.

41
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:47.000
When I read that I read what I read and again, I wish I remembered it better. What I read I read the whole thing and when you see the whole manual, it's 250 pages and there's a lot of stuff that gets into stuff that wouldn't have been as pertinent to where I was and what I was doing.

42
00:05:47.000 --> 00:06:03.000
So I think I probably saw the first two or three chapters of this and I absolutely know for a fact, I saw the first chapter, which is what I want to dive into today. Now this is this is what made me want to dive into because it believe me.

43
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000
This is one of the first manuals that I wanted to cover. I said, oh, you know, I should cover the field. I should cover the counter and surgery field, man. We should go and read that.

44
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Well, here's the deal. It is a huge manual, right? And a lot of it digs into the weeds and kind of gets really granular on, you know, how you do logistics inside it. So there's a lot of really deep, not deep's not the right word. There's a lot of very tactical techniques that you're going to use to make things happen inside of a counter insurgency.

45
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:53.000
But what I find fascinating about this is the way that it relates to absolutely everything, especially from a leadership perspective, especially from a leadership perspective, because you start thinking about things. You're thinking about the way the world is formulated.

46
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And if you think about it from an insurgency and that counter insurgency perspective, you start to see things much clearer. And the reason is because let's face it. If you, if you want to take a look at things, you want to say, oh, war is comparable to everything, right? Everything is comparable to war. Could, is it possible to say that?

47
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Okay. Well, it's possible to say that. But if you don't include insurgency in that and counter insurgency in that, look war is not always, especially in business, especially inside inside of a business inside of a team.

48
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Is it really a war when, you know, I'm trying to get some of one of my subordinate teams to do what my other subordinate team is doing? And they're giving me resistance. Is that war? Is that an all-out war? Not really.

49
00:07:44.000 --> 00:08:12.000
It's more like an insurgency. And what I've got to do, I can't just go to war with them. If I go to war with them, I'm going to destroy them. That's the goal of war. Insurgency means I'm going to form relationships. I'm going to bring people on board. I'm going to get rid of the people that are bad actors. Like it's a totally different, much more nuanced thing. And that's what allows you when you can put, when you can look at things through the prism of insurgency encounter insurgency, it gives you, it will give you some,

50
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:30.000
it will give you some visibility on how to handle situations. So it's real easy to say, we're at war with our competitor. Okay, I get that. We're at war with our competitor. We're going to go to war with our competitor. We're going to go to war with this other team.

51
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:59.000
But when you say, hey, we've got people inside of our own organization that don't agree with what we're doing. All of a sudden it takes on a totally different meaning. Because if you go to war with them, what do you do? You destroy them. Can you, can you effectively and perfectly destroy only the things that you want in a war? No. War means there's going to be collateral damage. Means people are going to, you know, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, not really he thing.

52
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So, but insurgency and counter insurgency is more nuanced. It takes more. You have to use a scalpel instead of using a battle axe, right? That's what you're doing.

53
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And so when you start seeing things as an insurgency and acting as if you're utilizing counter insurgency procedures to try and solve that problem, it's a much more accurate way of saying, hey.

54
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Everything in life is comparable to war.

55
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Okay. Everything in life, compared to war, maybe, but that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is this allows you to make much better analogies like that.

56
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I'm not saying there's perfect. I'm not saying everything in life is war. No. This allows you if there's a war analogy, if there's a war metaphor there, if there's things to be learned from war,

57
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:04.000
you have to learn from the insurgency and counter insurgency mindset. So, let's get into this.

58
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And I want to make sure that I kind of point some of this stuff out as we go through.

59
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:22.000
So here's the forward. This manual is designed to fill a doctrinal gap. It's been 20 years since the US Army published a manual devoted to counter insurgency operations at 25 since their Marine Corps published its last manual.

60
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:35.000
With our soldiers and Marines fighting insurgency in both Afghanistan and Iraq, it is thus essential that we give them a manual that provides principles and guidelines for counter insurgency operations. And they call that coin.

61
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Such guidance must be grounded in historical studies. However, it must be informed by contemporary experiences. So what's cool about this is,

62
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and they reference the counter insurgency and the insurgency in Iraq in 2005, like that's how up to date this thing was. And they were trying to get this information out there as quick as they could.

63
00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:05.000
This manual takes a general approach to coin. The Army and Marine Corps recognize that every insurgency is contextual and presents its own set of challenges. So guess what?

64
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Every little disagreement that you have inside your team has its own little contextual things that are happening in its own set of challenges. So you have to be able to adapt to that.

65
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:25.000
You cannot fight former Saddamists and Islamic extremists the same way you would fight the Viet Kong, the Moros, which is a Philippine,

66
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:38.000
what's called in Surgeon Group, or the Tupamaro's, which was a year away, the application of principles and fundamentals to deal with each very considerably.

67
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:58.000
It goes on to say that nonetheless there's common characteristics of insurgencies. It says, a counter insurgency campaign is, as described in this manual, a mix of offense, defense, and stability operations conducted along multiple lines of operations. So that right there.

68
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:10.000
If you take that little thing right there into your mindset because if we just say we're going to war, what does that mean? It means optimally we're just going on offense.

69
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Maybe we say we're going to go off and put what we have to go on defense sometimes.

70
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
But then stability, like what does that mean? That means you're trying to keep this whole organization together.

71
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:33.000
But you're not worried about this. When I'm going to total war with echoes country, not worried about stability for you. I'm worried about just destroying you. I'm going on offense.

72
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And then conducted along multiple lines of operations. So that means there's all kind. It's not just fighting. It's not just guns.

73
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:57.000
It requires soldiers Marines to deploy a mix of both familiar combat tasks and skills more often associated with non military agencies with balance between them depending on the local situation. This is not easy. Leaders at all levels must adjust their approach constantly.

74
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Ensuring that their elements are ready each day to be greeted with a handshake or a hand grenade.

75
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:15.000
What is that duty or mentality? I mean, just think you're going into a meeting. You got to be ready to deal with a handshake or a hand grenade.

76
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
That's what you got to be ready for.

77
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:32.000
To take on missions that only infrequently practiced until recent years at our combat training centers to be our nation builders as well as warriors to help reestablish institutions and local security forces to assist in rebuilding infrastructure and basic services.

78
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And if facilitate the establishment of local governance in rule of law, that's what you throw the military into all that stuff. That's why counterinsurgency is so hard.

79
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Yeah, just everything I just said going awards like the easy part. Here's the bad guys go kill them. That's the easy part. Everything else I just said that's what makes it so complicated.

80
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Collecting a successful counterinsurgency campaign thus requires a flexible adaptive force led by agile, well-informed culturally astute leaders.

81
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Probably the opposite of what the stereotypical military person is.

82
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
His our hope that this manual provides a necessary guidelines to succeed in such a campaign.

83
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:26.000
In operations that inevitably are exceedingly difficult and complex. Our soldiers and Marines deserve nothing less and it's signed David H. Patreus.

84
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Lieutenant General, US Army and James Anne Matas, Lieutenant General, United States Marine Corps.

85
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000
So there's your introduction. Right out of the gate, you can see what dealing with something totally different.

86
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Just infinitely more complex.

87
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Chapter one and this is the only chapter we're going to cover today.

88
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And it may be the look like I said it gets into some very granular stuff, but this is such a good opening.

89
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Chapter one, insurgency and counterinsurgency, counterinsurgency is not just thinking man's warfare. It's the graduate level of war.

90
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Special forces officer in Iraq 2005. And this is what's really cool about this is

91
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000
the battle of Ramadi is seen as a model of counterinsurgency.

92
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:35.000
And I was lucky enough to be there and lucky enough to sit in brigade operators and division operators and to sit with the brigade commander and listen to what his thoughts were and hear what the input was and hear.

93
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I mean, it just was I was so lucky to be a part of this.

94
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:47.000
To be there. So, starts off overview, insurgency and counterinsurgency are subsets of war.

95
00:15:47.000 --> 00:16:05.000
The globalization and technology and technological advancement have influenced contemporary conflict in nature of war in the 21st century is the same as it has been since ancient times of violent clash of interest between or among organized groups characterized by use of military force.

96
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Success in war still depends on a group's ability to mobilize support for its political interests and generate sufficient violence to achieve political consequences.

97
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Means to achieve these goals are not limited to regular armies employed by a nation state at its core.

98
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:45.000
War is a violent struggle between hostile independent and irreconcilable wills attempting to impose their desires on another. It is a complex interaction between human beings and is played out in a continuous process of action, reaction and adaptation.

99
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:59.000
War. This manual is available for free on the interwebs Google it. I'm not going to read the whole thing today. I'm going to hit some highlights.

100
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Says this also, it's scale and complexity should never this time. Counterinsurgency. It's scale and complexity should never be underestimated by leaders and planners indeed.

101
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:19.000
The possible scale and complexity must be understood before the beginning of any such operation. This is a mistake we've seemed to make over and over again.

102
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:34.000
You think you're the big badass American military. We're going there. We're going to squash these these enemy soldiers and the peasants will be on board. You know the local populace will be on board when they see the freedom.

103
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:45.000
And we just underestimate this thing all day long. You underestimate how hard it is to do this. How hard it is to actually execute a counterinsurgency.

104
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Talks about a couple different aspects of insurgency, a couple of some kinds. A revolution, which they describe as an unplanned spontaneous explosion of popular will.

105
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Another one is a coup d'état, which is a small group of plotters that replace state leaders with little support from the people at large. And an in insurgency is an organized protracted.

106
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Political military struggle designed to weaken government control.

107
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Insurgency is normally seek to either overthrow existing social order and relocate power within the country.

108
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Talks about internal wars as the name internal wars implies these are primarily conflicts within states, not conflicts between states.

109
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:39.000
And they all contain at least some element of civil war. That's why I think so much of this is pertinent to being a leader.

110
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Because so much of being a leader isn't about how you're taking the fight to the enemy. It's how you're handling the people inside your own country.

111
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:57.000
That's what's hard. Handling the people inside your own company, handling the people inside your own organization. Let me tell you something.

112
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Adational on front. Where we do leadership consulting.

113
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:19.000
We spend at least as much time helping solve the problems inside the company as we do helping companies figure out how to solve what they do to beat their competitors.

114
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Because if you don't have a squared away organized situation inside your team, you're not going to beat the competitors. You're not going to defeat your enemy.

115
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:38.000
So this counter insurgency, these counter insurgents tactics are what you use to help your own team stay unified.

116
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
And if you don't utilize them correctly, guess what you get? You get an insurgency.

117
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
And at worst, it rips your team apart.

118
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:58.000
But even if it doesn't rip your team apart, it has you rowing in different directions. And when you row in different directions, you don't go or you're supposed to go.

119
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
So you need to keep a check on that.

120
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:13.000
One possible exception to this rule involves what can be termed a liberation insurgency where indigents elements seek to expel or overthrow what they perceive to be a foreign occupational government.

121
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Such a resistance movement could be mounted by a legitimate government in exile as well as elements competing for that role.

122
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Another thing that happens in business businesses get bought, business get bought by bigger businesses businesses have people get inside and take over.

123
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:36.000
There's hostile figures. There's all these kind of situations. And then you get these little insurgency inside companies inside businesses inside teams.

124
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Also, we can be outside actors getting involved.

125
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Fast forward in all cases, the long term objective for all side remains acceptance of the legitimacy of one side's claim to political power by the people state of region.

126
00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:07.000
So if you're a leader and you are in a company and you're not considered legitimate, you're basically out of the gate, you're probably going to be dealing with insurgency.

127
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
That's just how it's happening.

128
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:28.000
It's going to be rough. Another little section here. The scale and complexity of coin should never be underestimated. The effort requires a firm political will and extreme patients on the part of the government. It's people and countries providing its support.

129
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Why it's bed security requirements also limit flexibility again, seating to seating the initiative to insurgency. There's all kinds of reasons that the insurgency haven't advantage.

130
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Right. Another quote here. The contest of the internal war is not fair as most of the rules favor the insurgence.

131
00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Most of the rules favor the insurgence. I racked the absolutely did do do the insurgence and I racked care if they wounded friendly civilians not one bit.

132
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Did they care if they killed each other not one bit did they use torture absolutely did they use terror absolutely.

133
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Did they do the most brutal and savage things to the local populace? Yes, they absolutely did and they didn't care at all.

134
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
So they have a completed advantage when it comes to the rules.

135
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Any whether you're talking about the tactical rules or the actual rules of engagement or the law of our own conflict. They don't care about any of that.

136
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:43.000
The insurgent can make exorbitant promises and point out governmental shortcomings caused by the insurgency. So yeah, so you make a mistake fighting an insurgency. They're going to use it to their advantage.

137
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:55.000
You kill civilians by accident. Oh, that's going to be a you know national news world news global news. They're going to take advantage of that. They want that to happen.

138
00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Fast forward coin is not an approach to war that can be classified simply as foreign internal defense. It features a full spectrum of operations including stability operations like any other campaign.

139
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:16.000
And all cases, however, insurgencies will not be defeated simply by killing insurgencies since the insurgencies since the insurgencies begins with strategic initiative.

140
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Meaning they have an advantage.

141
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
The counter insurgen is usually involved.

142
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Initially and more defensive than offensive operations. That's the way it kind of kicks off. They're attacking you. You didn't even know who they are.

143
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Victory cannot be gained until the people accept the legitimacy of the government mounting coin and stop actively and possibly supporting the insurgencies.

144
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:50.000
That right there, I was smiling when I read this because that's one of the quotes that I just completely ripped off from this when I read it for the first time and I started using that all the time.

145
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:58.000
You know, I started saying, well, you know, when my boss would ask me, you know, what are you guys trying to get done? I'm so sorry, you know, we're trying to stop the passive support.

146
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:22.000
That's happening for the insurgencies and all of us a nice-ounded smart stole stole stole words from them because that's what there was a lot of in Romadi. In Romadi there was local populace was so scared that if an insurgen came into their house and wanted to use their window to shoot their sniper rifle from, they would just like get out of their way, get them some bread.

147
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:34.000
You know, we don't want to bother you. You do what you got to do. We're not here to cause you, but they provided passive support. And that happens inside companies too. You know, you get the whatever that one element that used to be here that's going to help you.

148
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:42.000
They're going to give you a hand. They're not definitely not going to rat you out because they see that illegitimate leader that whatever stepped in.

149
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:52.000
I do, just want to keep their job a lot of time. Yeah, exactly. They don't want to make any waves, right?

150
00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:02.000
This gives a good section that kind of talks about the histories of insurgencies. That's why it's worth pulling out this book.

151
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Each insurgency is unique, although there may be similarities among them. In all cases, the insurgency aim is to force political change.

152
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
And this is important. I've just kind of read my note here.

153
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Force political change, but actually sometimes, especially in business, the goal is to prevent change, right? They don't want some new system. They don't want some new procedure. So they have a little insurgency to fight against their fighting against change.

154
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Specific types of insurgency. Here's some things that you're supposed to try and figure out. What's the root cause of the insurgency? How important is that, right? If you're an a team and you're in a business, you're in a leadership position.

155
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
And there's some kind of an insurgency happening. You feel that.

156
00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Find out what the root of it is. Where is this coming from? Next, extend to which it enjoys support both internally and externally. Who's who's on board with us?

157
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Basis on which insurgency appeal to target population.

158
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Insurgency motivation and depth of commitment where they are, like how much does this mean to them, likely in search of weapons and tactics, operational environment, which insurgency to initiate and develop their campaign.

159
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:30.000
So there's some things to look at. And this is why this, again, this is why I think this is important because

160
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:39.000
if you just look at your own team and you just think, oh, there against me, I'll met war with them. It's a problem. The way you fight that war is not going to be correct.

161
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:54.000
If you look at it as an insurgency, you say, okay, how do I actually assess this? And this becomes this gives you such a strategic advantage.

162
00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Several different types of insurgency. Some of them seek to completely change the existing political system and our guests.

163
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
The gallitarians, traditionalists, pluralists, they got good little definitions for all these in there.

164
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Some do not seek total political power in a state. These are secessionists, reformist, preventionists, commercialists.

165
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000
And you've got to try to figure out what it is that your insurgency are seeking.

166
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Insurgen strategies you've got conspiratorial.

167
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Conspiratorial strategy involves a few leaders and a militant cadre or activist party,

168
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:43.000
seizing control of government structures or exploiting a revolutionary situation.

169
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
This is what's interesting. Such insurgency remains secretive as long as possible,

170
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
emerging only when success can be quickly achieved.

171
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
That's definitely something to think about.

172
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Because you think everything's going cool, right? You hear a little bit of murmur here, a murmur there.

173
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Someone's talking about this method that we're using, someone's against some way,

174
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
some change that we want to make, hear little whispers.

175
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
And then all of a sudden one day boom, you get hit in the face with it.

176
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
And you aren't ready for it.

177
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
So you've got to watch out for that.

178
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Military focus, these are ones that are going to use military force to try and make things happen.

179
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Urban organizations like the Irish Republican Army and Latin American groups have pursued an urban warfare strategy.

180
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Approaches as terrorist tactics and cities to so-disorder and create government repression.

181
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Those objectives have not generated much success without wider rural support.

182
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
You also got the protracted popular war.

183
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
God, that's an ugly term protracted war.

184
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000
What does that mean? It's going to last a long time.

185
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000
And what sucks is from a psychological standpoint, like if you and I are going to train you,

186
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.000
you're going to train you, you know that I'm just a guy that's just going to go protract it.

187
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Like you don't want none of that, right?

188
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
I tend not to.

189
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Hey, well, let me, let me, let's say you set up the clock, the timer,

190
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
and you put five minute rounds on there.

191
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
And then I walk over and I just turn it off.

192
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
There's no time limit.

193
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
It's just going to be a protracted war.

194
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
It's where going.

195
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
I don't care how long it takes.

196
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
I was thinking of doing it.

197
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Is there still, is there a digital tournament right now?

198
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
That's no time limit.

199
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
It's a mission only.

200
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Does one exist right now?

201
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
I don't know.

202
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
We've had some variations of it attempted.

203
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Yeah.

204
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
But is there anyone that's doing no time limit?

205
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
No.

206
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
It's a mission only.

207
00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
I think there's certain ones that have like those types of matches,

208
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
but they're I think they're specific, like special matches.

209
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Like no time limit matches or something like that.

210
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
It's not all of them, but it's actually pretty rare, but yes, I've seen that.

211
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
What if we do a GJT tournament called protracted war?

212
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Yeah.

213
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Sure.

214
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
The thing is, you got to be ready.

215
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
You got to be ready for it.

216
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Think about this as a competitor.

217
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
You're like, I got a hydrate because I might be fighting for the next nine hours.

218
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Well, that's what the UFC was.

219
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Yeah.

220
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Yeah.

221
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000
The first ones were, how many before they made the time limits?

222
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
15 minute time limit with like over time.

223
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
So it was one and two, I think.

224
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Yeah.

225
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000
And three?

226
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Something like that.

227
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
So you'd have to do this.

228
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
I had an idea.

229
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
You do because you got to figure most matches aren't going to last like nine hours.

230
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Yeah.

231
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Very few matches would last nine hours.

232
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
I think I think very few matches would go over an hour,

233
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000
but occasionally you would get to just really evenly matched humans.

234
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
And you know how hard it is to submit somebody.

235
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
That's good.

236
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
But if you had three mats running at the same time,

237
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
and they were all had no time limit protracted war on each one of them.

238
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
So that way, if you have an audience that wants to see this,

239
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
they can watch whichever one is this happening.

240
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Because that's face it.

241
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
And then the problem is going to get, you know, the guy's going to get a position.

242
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
And he's just going to start grinding somebody down, but it might take two hours.

243
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
I mean, if I got, if I was going against you in this tournament,

244
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
and I got across side, it would be a long time.

245
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Yeah.

246
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
I would be there for a long time.

247
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Yeah.

248
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
I wouldn't rush it.

249
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
I would cook you for a while.

250
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Sure.

251
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Yeah.

252
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Why would I rush?

253
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Yeah, no reason.

254
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
And I think that was the whole thing about Gigi to begin with, like, I'll help, you know,

255
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Haley Gracie's, you know, smaller guy, you know, and he lets that, you know,

256
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
he can put himself in safe position, positioning tape, minimize damage, all this stuff,

257
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
and then like, I get's all tired, and then he can use his, you know, leverage or whatever.

258
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Like, there was a lot of them.

259
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
His matches old school, over one hour.

260
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Yeah.

261
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
When they had no time limit.

262
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
But you got to be ready for that.

263
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Yeah, as a competitor, but as far as tournaments go, as an audience member.

264
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Two, you got to be ready for that.

265
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Yeah.

266
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Well, that's why maybe you're doing it with multiple matches going on at the same time.

267
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
And that way you can, you know, you can kind of highlight the big, the match where there's action happening.

268
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
But I watched a, I don't, I don't think it was no time limit, but limit, but it was one of those ones.

269
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
I think it was like a 30 minute time limit.

270
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
It was like a super fight.

271
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
And one of the early tournaments that I did, and they were super good.

272
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
They're both really good.

273
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
So they're even.

274
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
And like, not a won't even score to point.

275
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
And after a while, I was like, brother, this is, I liked Gigi to a lot.

276
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
But it's got a boring.

277
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Yeah, that's, that's the, you know, what the problem is there?

278
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
The time limit.

279
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
The time limit.

280
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Because when you have a time limit, you're like, oh, well, I was training yesterday.

281
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
I was like, hmm.

282
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
There was something like 40 seconds left.

283
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
I could see it on the clock.

284
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
And I was fighting, I was rolling with Andy.

285
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000
And I was like fighting to keep him in, you know, from passing my guard.

286
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
And then, you know, there was like 32 seconds left.

287
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
And I was like, hey, man, even if he passed my guard right now,

288
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
you know, he's, chances are he's not going to finish me.

289
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
So, so I'm not saying I let him pass because he definitely passed it.

290
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
But, yeah, you don't kind of, you know, I kind of like,

291
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
within a lot, lock my hands and I kind of sat there and I'm like, you know,

292
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000
and even he knows it.

293
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Yeah, he knows it.

294
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000
He's laughing.

295
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
He's like smiling or whatever.

296
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
He's like, yeah.

297
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
So that's in your head.

298
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Yeah.

299
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
So when you, when you're in these things, do you have a time limit?

300
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000
You're like, whatever.

301
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
I can, I can hang out for another seven minutes.

302
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Yeah.

303
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Not just don't expose anything.

304
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
But if there's no time limit,

305
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
that's different mentality.

306
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
So when you're going into those protracted wars,

307
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
if you're the, if you're the insurgent,

308
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
bro, you live there.

309
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Yeah.

310
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
You live there.

311
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Your life, no.

312
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
So, so you don't care how long.

313
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
You know, when we, when we fought Vietnam, when we fought in Vietnam,

314
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
the Vietnamese, they're not going anywhere.

315
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
They're not, they're at home.

316
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Right.

317
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
You know, we have to go over there.

318
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
When we're fighting in Iraq, they're at home.

319
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
The insurgents are there.

320
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
They live there.

321
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
There was foreign fighters, of course.

322
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
But Afghanistan, same thing.

323
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
So they have this weapon on their side,

324
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
which is time, the protracted war.

325
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Yeah.

326
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
This is going to some kind of off,

327
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
but I was watching this.

328
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
It was like, it wasn't a documentary,

329
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
but you know, the kind of words like on like discovery,

330
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
or one of these, and then they,

331
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
they propose like, what if this happened?

332
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
How, you know, like there's a show called What If Humans Disappeared,

333
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
or something like that.

334
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
You ever heard of that?

335
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Where it's like, okay, after, you know,

336
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
10 years, the cities would start to get bigger and after.

337
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
And they have the CGI and it's pretty cool.

338
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
So there was one where it said,

339
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
it said, what if aliens took over?

340
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Mm.

341
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
And how would we beat them?

342
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Because if aliens took over,

343
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000
they would, that's what they would be.

344
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
They wouldn't be like, oh,

345
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
let me just come and live with you guys.

346
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
That's what they're saying.

347
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Chances are,

348
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Chances are they're not benevolent.

349
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Yeah, not to help people.

350
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
They're here for earth, you know?

351
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
It's kind of like, I mean, think about it.

352
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
That's a every living thing.

353
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
It's kind of like, but I live here now.

354
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Kind of thing.

355
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
We got to,

356
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
so anyway, they're saying,

357
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
they're saying how would we fight the aliens?

358
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
And they're, they're breaking it down.

359
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Like, this is what the aliens would do first.

360
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
This is what they do second.

361
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
This is what they do third.

362
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000
They're just totally breaking it out.

363
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
I was like, thank.

364
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
But they're saying at the end of the, at the end of the day,

365
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
the best way we could win is through.

366
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
I think they call it guerrilla warfare or maybe.

367
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000
That's what they're in certain circumstances.

368
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
I forget what they called it.

369
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
But that's what they would say.

370
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
It's like, we live here.

371
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
So we have that advantage of like,

372
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
we can hide for, you know, months.

373
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
And then attacking, then go hide again.

374
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
You know, because we live here.

375
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Meanwhile, they're here.

376
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
So it's like, they're here.

377
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
They got to run supplies from their own.

378
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Yeah.

379
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Whatever alien spaceship.

380
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Yeah.

381
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
And they got to make moves.

382
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
And they got to drag me into a protracted conversation about alien evasions.

383
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
I'm losing this wall over here.

384
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000
But it's the exact metaphor, though,

385
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
you know, like where if like aliens are coming over,

386
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
whether it be to take over or to get some alien job done.

387
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
But we live here.

388
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
We don't, you know, we can take hits.

389
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
We're still living here.

390
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
This is the thing that's ridiculous about this argument.

391
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Is what level of competence does the alien do the aliens have?

392
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
We'll say varying levels of competence.

393
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Okay.

394
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000
So if they're, let's face it,

395
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000
we can get invaded by aliens that were not that advanced.

396
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
And we would just kick their ass real quick.

397
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Like on the district, you know, something like that?

398
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
I don't know.

399
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
But I don't, I'm not familiar.

400
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
When we're to that battle take place.

401
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
South Africa.

402
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
What was, who, who are the insurgents?

403
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Aliens.

404
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Oh, no, the insurgents were, I guess that's not really an insurgent situation.

405
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Yes, sir.

406
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Okay.

407
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
I thought you were talking about an actual one time situation that I was unaware of.

408
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Oh, yeah.

409
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
The aliens came down.

410
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Yeah.

411
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
I don't know.

412
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
But, um, yeah.

413
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
And that movie.

414
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Yeah.

415
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000
I guess, you know, a district name was not about any kind of insurgents yet.

416
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Oh.

417
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
It was more of that show.

418
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
What was their competence?

419
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
What was their competence?

420
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
The alien?

421
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Yeah.

422
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Basically, it was like aliens.

423
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
I don't know.

424
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
I forget why they were there.

425
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
No one really knew why they were there.

426
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
But it's essentially the ship didn't,

427
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
it didn't crash, but it sort of got jammed up.

428
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
And they were sort of stuck there.

429
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Okay.

430
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
So they would, they fight after a few months or a month or whatever.

431
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
They, they were, the humans people went up and with their helicopters.

432
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Because the alien ship kind of came, didn't crash just hovered.

433
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
And the state, they didn't open, didn't nothing.

434
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
So they go up and they explore, they open the alien craft.

435
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
It's pretty good, good show.

436
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Anyway, they open it and all the aliens are all starving and

437
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
freaking, you know, they're messed up.

438
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Like they're desolate, you know?

439
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
God.

440
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
And so they're like, hey, well, they're not hostile.

441
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000
So what do we do?

442
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Just leave it, you know, so they set up these caps form,

443
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
you know, they've helped help them or whatever.

444
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
So the aliens were kind of quarantined.

445
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
They were both kind of tank of food.

446
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Like a food.

447
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
So they kind of shuffle supplies, but rather sort of aliens, you know?

448
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Like, I don't know what do you do.

449
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
You can't just let them live with us because they're kind of whatever.

450
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
So it's kind of that situation.

451
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
So it was less about fighting or it was less about that.

452
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
It was more about some other issue.

453
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Yeah, and I guess you'd have to figure that if an alien element

454
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
made it here, they're pretty advanced.

455
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
They got some technology.

456
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
So I don't think we're going to be coming up against the JV team.

457
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
No.

458
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
But that's what that show was saying.

459
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000
The JV team isn't going to show up on Earth.

460
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000
No.

461
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Right?

462
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Because how do they get here?

463
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
They designed some kind of a spaceship.

464
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Yeah.

465
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Got here.

466
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
These are some, these are some Elon Musk level smart.

467
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Well, then again, technically, sure,

468
00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
but that does that indicate or does that prove that

469
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
they're going to be squared away in all ways.

470
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
You know, maybe they just have this new technology.

471
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
They can do this stuff, but if you can make a spaceship that can get here,

472
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
I mean, you had to fight to get here.

473
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000
This was not easy.

474
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Yeah, but that's a different kind of fight when you think about it.

475
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000
It's insane.

476
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000
It's kind of like, you know, oh, maybe they're just people that

477
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
imagine if they just didn't even have the concept of violence, right?

478
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Yeah, just was torn.

479
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Yeah.

480
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
And so they could show up here.

481
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
And the first one that tries to do something,

482
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
somebody just hits him and they have with a bat.

483
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
And they're just all shocked.

484
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Yeah, I'll confuse them.

485
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Yeah.

486
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
But is that even possible that there's a group that just has no comprehension of violence?

487
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
If there is, you know what they'd be, they'd be aliens.

488
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Because, you know, same things work different.

489
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
You know, like, everyone's in a lot of like,

490
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
you'll get a situation where, I don't know.

491
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
This turned into grounded violence or crap.

492
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
I'm thinking of something real like ambiguous actually right now.

493
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000
But let's say, okay, let's say you're in the alien.

494
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
You go to a distant planet.

495
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
You're like, we're going to take over.

496
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
So we're going to, we're going to bring this poison.

497
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
This poison is like the most lethal poison ever created here.

498
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
So we're going to take this and we're just going to exterminate them all.

499
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Like that's how.

500
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
So we're going to go and then you go to this distant galaxy.

501
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
You go to their planet.

502
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Whatever.

503
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Perfect.

504
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Perfect.

505
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Just like earth.

506
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
And you go, you start spraying this poison and they're licking it up.

507
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Yeah, they're like, oh my gosh, it solves like a bunch of their problems and make some super, you know, it's like that kind of situation.

508
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:38.000
I'm just saying, it doesn't prove that just because they know how to travel through dimensions or what and it doesn't mean they're going to be successful in everything.

509
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
You seem to be, you could be the opposite.

510
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Right on.

511
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000
All right.

512
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Well,

513
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
protracted war.

514
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000
That's where we were at.

515
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Yes, sir.

516
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Mao's theory of protracted war outlines three-faced political military approach strategic defensive.

517
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000
This is where the enemy.

518
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
And in this case, your flip flop and back and forth and who's the enemy.

519
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
But the enemy, meaning the government has stronger forces.

520
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000
So you're in defense.

521
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Then stalemate where you're doing gorilla operations.

522
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
And then offensive is when you actually have.

523
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Be down the government forces enough that you can actually have a real war with them.

524
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Almost like a conventional war.

525
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
And then it talks about how you can go.

526
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000
These stages you can go.

527
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
You can go through one stage.

528
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
You can skip a stage.

529
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
You can come back to the stage.

530
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
So that's what happens.

531
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000
Reproduct or war.

532
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000
It's very hard to.

533
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Speaking of protracted war.

534
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
It's very hard to get this submission on the insurgents because.

535
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Every time you get them get him in a chokehold, they slip out and they slip away.

536
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Right.

537
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
And now you can't go and find them because they slip back in with the local populace.

538
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
So you've got to kind of.

539
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000
You know, check for that.

540
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
So that's protracted popular war.

541
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
They got traditional many contemporary insurgents.

542
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000
These fit a more traditional approach based on clan tribe or ethnic group.

543
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Such insurgents typically has an entire community.

544
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Join the effort as a whole.

545
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Bring it with them.

546
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
They're existing.

547
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
A social and military hierarchy.

548
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:23.000
The primary struggle in an internal war is to mobilize people in a battle for legitimacy.

549
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
And I think that word legitimacy and legit is one thing that made me start thinking,

550
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
maybe I should do the counter-researchs, you may know.

551
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Because think about how often that happens in an organization.

552
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.000
The leader is either legitimate or not.

553
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000
And if you're not considered a legitimate everything is hard.

554
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:51.000
And if people think you're legitimate, everything is that much easier.

555
00:42:51.000 --> 00:43:00.000
So when you are acting as a leader and you do things that negate or detract from your legitimacy,

556
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
you're doing a whole lot more damage than you think you are.

557
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Every time you use your authority in a abusive way,

558
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
your legitimacy goes down.

559
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
Every time you tell a lie, your legitimacy goes down.

560
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Every time you do the right thing your legitimacy goes up.

561
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Yeah.

562
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:27.000
I feel like you know when people will say, I demand respect.

563
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
You know like that thing.

564
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
You automatically just lost respect.

565
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Yeah, kind of right?

566
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000
Yeah.

567
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
It's because that it's not really.

568
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
And by the way, you don't even have to say that. You could just act like that.

569
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Just act like you demand respect.

570
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
Yeah, like call me surr, damn it.

571
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Kind of thing.

572
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
I'm not saying there's anything wrong calling someone surr or whatever.

573
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
But you know that kind of stuff.

574
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000
They'll harp on that kind of stuff.

575
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Like you can tell someone's reaction when they're reacting to this detail,

576
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
where it's like, oh, bad, you're like, I see what you're doing.

577
00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000
I know.

578
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000
It's you're basically saying like, I demand respect.

579
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
I'm not going to, I mean, me earning it.

580
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
That's all whole different thing.

581
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
You know, so you're saying, but you just better give it to me kind of thing.

582
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
So it's like one of those, you know, if you're illegitimate, that tends to be like what it looks like.

583
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
If you're legitimate, it tends to not be what it looks like.

584
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
It's just a good little framework to think and to filter your actions through.

585
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Does this make me more or less legitimate?

586
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Mobilization means there are five means to mobilize popular support.

587
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Part persuasion, coercion, reaction to abuses foreign support, apolitical motivations.

588
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
A mixture of them may motivate anyone.

589
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Individuals. So persuasion.

590
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Political Social Security and economic benefits entice people to support one side of the other.

591
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000
This is where you're like, hey, we're going to take care of you.

592
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Coversion.

593
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
This is the carrot in the stick, right?

594
00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Coversion is the carrot. Coversion is the stick. You either get on board with what we're doing or we're going to give you a beat down.

595
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Reaction to abuses. This one is important. A government that abuses its people or is is tyrannical.

596
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Generates resistance to its rule. Think about that from a leadership perspective.

597
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
Think about all those three things from a leadership perspective.

598
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
You can either use persuasion. You can use code.

599
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000
So carrot, stick and then reaction to abuses.

600
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
So if you're abuses, if you abuse people as a leader,

601
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
they're going to have been injured, maltreated, victimized dishonor,

602
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000
or had close friends relative killed by the government,

603
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000
particularly by security forces, may lash back at their attackers.

604
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
So when you're abusive to people, it's going to come back at you.

605
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000
It adds fuel to the insurgency.

606
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
So you're saying the insurgency will use that?

607
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Oh, yeah.

608
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000
That's the media.

609
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
That's how you get people to come on board.

610
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
If I show you your house now, it's like, hey, echo.

611
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
I was really sorry to hear about your brother.

612
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
I can't believe that they did that.

613
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Yeah.

614
00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
I can't believe the government security forces did that to your brother.

615
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Do you want to fight back?

616
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Yeah.

617
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Here's what we're doing.

618
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
You see what I'm going on there?

619
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000
So that means that when you're fighting an insurgency,

620
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000
you can't add fuel to that fire.

621
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000
You have to be very careful in how you act towards the populace

622
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:27.000
the populace because the populace, because the insurgence will utilize your abusive actions

623
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
to bolster their cause.

624
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:42.000
Foreign support, obviously, you can have people on the outside that like to see that want to support some insurgency inside of a country.

625
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
A political motivations.

626
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Here's criminals, mercenaries, people attracted by the holy warriors romantic status and others who self-images of being a warrior and a fighter for a cause might also join in search.

627
00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:03.000
I think you saw a lot of that nicest people that were just criminals and just wanted to go get crime on.

628
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Yeah.

629
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:12.000
I mean, it wasn't like they were promised in a whole bunch of nice stuff in the Islamic state.

630
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Yeah.

631
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Other than authorized rape of women, children, girls and boys.

632
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:26.000
There was, you know, I'm not going to say how I saw this, but I saw some ISIS promo videos.

633
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Like promo, like, yeah.

634
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
I don't know that they were recruiting videos.

635
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
Oh, no, there's some of those too.

636
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000
But it was like a promo, like advertisement for this cool, like club kind of thing.

637
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Yeah.

638
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Oh, wait, were they ones that were like insanely violent?

639
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.000
No.

640
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
So they were just kind of real positive.

641
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Yeah.

642
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000
And it would show like, yeah, there was a whole bunch of them.

643
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000
And yes, they're the insanely violent one that were kind of like produced a little bit.

644
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
You know, that was, yeah, that was kind of odd.

645
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000
It was like weird.

646
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Oh, because I don't know who they were marketing to.

647
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000
I mean, I couldn't relate to the audience that they were marketing to.

648
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000
We'll say that.

649
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000
But yeah, and the other one, the nice one was odd because of like, what everything else they've been putting out.

650
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000
You know, then it was like, almost like this utopian commercial.

651
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Yeah, that's the, that's a crazy world of, I guess, social media might have heard my due turn for the social media, emotional media.

652
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:32.000
It's not only for social media, it's actually all media because every media right now is just emotional media.

653
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
How can we make everyone hyper emotional?

654
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000
What story can we show to make everyone freak out?

655
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Let's do that.

656
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:47.000
What video can I tweet or share on the gram to make people get super crazy?

657
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Oh, yeah.

658
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000
Let's do that.

659
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Yeah, which one can we, can people retweet?

660
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000
That's a big one.

661
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Why would there be like, okay, this is like super retweetable?

662
00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Because you can get all fired up and then you're going to say something along lines and you're head.

663
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
You can say something along lines up of,

664
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000
can you believe this guy said this?

665
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Boom, retweet.

666
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Everyone who agrees with you?

667
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Boom, they're going to feel the same way, hopefully retweet too.

668
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000
People, it's also actually some people that weren't really thinking about it, see that and they go, wait.

669
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Yeah.

670
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Why?

671
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000
They get emotional.

672
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Yes.

673
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000
And then you get a whole, millions of people.

674
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Yeah.

675
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Um, next little sections is about causes,

676
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000
causes, causes, a principle or movement militantly defended or supported.

677
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000
In surgeons make create artificial contradictions using propaganda and misinformation.

678
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:44.000
In surgeons have much to gain by not limiting themselves to a single cause.

679
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000
In surgeons employed deep seated strategic causes as well as temporary local causes,

680
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000
adding or deleting them as circumstances demand.

681
00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:04.000
You get this sort of whatever your, whatever your problem is with the government, like if you're an surgeon in Iraq,

682
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:12.000
people, people, you know, not only do they say, well, well, and Iraq, it was the, the bathis that been in charge forever.

683
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:19.000
And not only that, but we don't have whatever, you know, we don't, we don't, we don't, we don't get enough money for our oil.

684
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Whatever grievance you have becomes part of something that we adopt.

685
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.000
And that can happen inside any team, right? What starts off is, you know, if you're mad, you know,

686
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000
I'm telling I'm mad because we're using a new method and you're mad because we didn't get a pay raise.

687
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Guess what? Now we got it. We both, I'm mad about both now.

688
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm top, you're damn right.

689
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
We need more money.

690
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Yeah.

691
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000
And that's how the insurgency's grow.

692
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000
You start adopting all these different problems.

693
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Yeah.

694
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
All these different causes, unify them into one giant cause.

695
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Yeah.

696
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.000
So it like solidifies the like enemy, like that's the enemy versus us.

697
00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:08.000
And he country ruled by a small group of that broad, without broad popular participation provides a political cause for insurgence.

698
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Exploited or repressed social groups by the entire, be they entire classes, that think groups are small.

699
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:22.000
And the elites may support larger causes in reaction to their own or narrower grievances.

700
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:28.000
So again, as a leader when you're looking at your team, in internal,

701
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:36.000
see that you might be getting multiple causes turned against you.

702
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Next section is about mobilizing resources.

703
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:48.000
And obviously insurgence, well, resort to tactics such as guerrilla warfare and terrorism, not only because of their disadvantages,

704
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:56.000
manpower organization, but also because they usually begin with limited or inadequate resources compared to the counterinsurgence.

705
00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:02.000
So that's why you end up with guerrilla warfare, asymmetrical warfare.

706
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000
They talk about money, they talk about insurgency and crime,

707
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:11.000
system and requirements often drive insurgence into relationships with organized crime or inter-criminal activities themselves.

708
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000
This is absolutely true.

709
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000
I know the Iraqis had all kinds of crime going on.

710
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000
So the insurgence had all kinds of crime going on.

711
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Smuggling and black markets and the whole nine yards to try and pay for what they were doing.

712
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:30.000
And then, you know, in Afghanistan, they got this massive drug trade to support the insurgency.

713
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:36.000
So that's definitely something that can be problematic.

714
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Elements of insurgency leaders, combatants, political cadre, exilaries and mass-base leaders control the insurgent movement.

715
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000
They are the idea people and the planners.

716
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:53.000
They usually exercise leadership through force of personality, the power of revolutionary ideas.

717
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000
It's not an interesting, the power of revolutionary ideas.

718
00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:01.000
It's not kind of interesting, like you always hear me talk about how I was a rebellious kid.

719
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:06.000
And I was rebellious in my Navy career without a doubt.

720
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000
I was rebellious. I always have that kind of rebellious thing.

721
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:16.000
But the idea that the power of revolutionary idea of revolutionary ideas,

722
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:21.000
there's like a natural human kind of,

723
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:26.000
there's a natural human draw to that. And you know what?

724
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:34.000
My best example of that, which you, my friend, will give me a full salute and credit for.

725
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Do you know what it is?

726
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.000
What is the insurgency that you think of that everyone is drawn to and everyone supports?

727
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
Surgency that everyone's drawn to.

728
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Just about every human being supports one particular insurgency.

729
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Individual responsibility.

730
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000
No. Star Wars.

731
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Star Wars.

732
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000
What's the deal?

733
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000
The movie.

734
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Yeah, the movie.

735
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Who are the rebels?

736
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000
The rebels.

737
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Right? They're revolutionary.

738
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000
That's what's happening.

739
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Why does why do these revolutionaries?

740
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:16.000
Why does she giveara? You don't have this t-shirt that everyone, because he's a revolutionary.

741
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Right? People like that.

742
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
Is there just some weird?

743
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:25.000
I guess it's, can be kind of like rooting for the underdog.

744
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Maybe there's some kind of attraction to that.

745
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
That just naturally exists.

746
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:39.000
That's why when we watch Star Wars, no one says, hey, I hope the Empire wins, right?

747
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000
I don't want saying that.

748
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000
Even the name the Empire.

749
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000
I see what's going on there.

750
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000
I mean, it's the American Revolution.

751
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000
The revolutionary ideas.

752
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000
People like that kind of thing.

753
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Yeah, under, I mean, that's a kind of thing.

754
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
You know why?

755
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
I guess, you know what?

756
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
I'm thinking through it psychologically.

757
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000
You know what? You like about it.

758
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000
You know what's naturally attractive about it?

759
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000
You take all your grievances in life.

760
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Right? I don't don't make enough money.

761
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
I didn't end up where I wanted to end up.

762
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000
My girlfriend dumped me, my boyfriend dumped me.

763
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000
I don't like my house.

764
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000
I don't like my car.

765
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000
I don't like my apartment.

766
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000
Whatever grievances you have, you can package all those things up,

767
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000
and you can point a finger at them, and you can say those things are all wrong.

768
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000
I'm being revolutionary over here.

769
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000
Yeah.

770
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Yeah, and you identify with that.

771
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000
I mean, back to the movie thing where you identify with the Empire.

772
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000
I really got my ass.

773
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.000
I really got my ass.

774
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000
I'm going to open up a door.

775
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000
You're the one who said Star Wars.

776
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000
So you think what if they call it just the rebellion?

777
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
What are they called? The Rebels?

778
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000
The Rebels? Yeah.

779
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.000
The Rebels? Yeah.

780
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000
The Belle in the Senate.

781
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Yeah.

782
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.000
And you support them.

783
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000
They're the underdog versus the Empire.

784
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.000
Yeah, but that's most movies, because I haven't seen most movies.

785
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
But that's a lot of movies.

786
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000
The underdog.

787
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000
That's a lot of.

788
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000
It's kind of, to be honest, it seems like all of them.

789
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Like, brought karate kid, freck-end,

790
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000
broody, I don't know, name the Rambo. I don't know.

791
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Whatever movies you watch, whatever.

792
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000
Yeah, the underdog.

793
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Yeah.

794
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
So those are the leaders.

795
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000
They're going to capitalize on the power of revolutionary ideas.

796
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Is it even in marketing?

797
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Right, even in marketing people like this is a revolutionary new.

798
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Paraps sneakers are phone or whatever.

799
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Right.

800
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000
Everyone is attracted to that idea.

801
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Well, remember on Rambo first blood part two, this that time where he was hiding in the wall.

802
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.000
Oh, yeah.

803
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.000
It wasn't the wall.

804
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.000
It was the mud wall, essentially, and then, you know, in Vietnam, whatever.

805
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000
And like he opened his eyes.

806
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.000
You could only see his eye.

807
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000
And then he'd like undoes his fingers first.

808
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
You know, then he comes out and kills everybody.

809
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000
That at the time was a revolutionary idea.

810
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Like, oh, he hid in the mud right there.

811
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000
That was kind of built the way he did it.

812
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000
You seems like.

813
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Right, they just, I think you just nailed it.

814
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000
But it's just captured all.

815
00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Oh, yeah.

816
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.000
They just captured all.

817
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Where else?

818
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Uh, combatants do the actual fighting and provide security.

819
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000
There's the political cadre.

820
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000
The cadre is the political core of the insurgency.

821
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.000
They're actively engaged in the struggle to accomplish the insurgency goals.

822
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Auxilaries are active sympathizers, active sympathizers who provide important support services.

823
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000
And then you get the mass base.

824
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000
And these are followers of the insurgent movement supporting the populace.

825
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:40.000
And again, so inside your organization, inside your team, you can identify who these people are when there's an insurgency going on.

826
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Right?

827
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000
There's the leaders of it.

828
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Kind of, guess, they have this advantage of.

829
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000
They're standing up to the man, right?

830
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000
They're revolutionary.

831
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
They got a little advantage there.

832
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000
There's combatants that are actually going to try and make things happen.

833
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:58.000
There's this cadre that's out there kind of, you know, run in their mouths and soings seeds of disc content.

834
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000
There's then there's sympathizers and the mass base.

835
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:08.000
So if you can identify who these people are, you can realize what you need to do to disrupt this insurgency from happening.

836
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Then isn't it weird that as we talk about this, I just had this instinct right now.

837
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Even in my own head, right now as we're having this conversation, even I sympathize with the insurgency.

838
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:25.000
I'm thinking about, oh, I got this new idea and the man and all that stuff.

839
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000
That's real.

840
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:31.000
That's real stuff that you feel.

841
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Maybe I think it's because we're American or is it a global thing?

842
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Like, are we American that were raised?

843
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000
Hey, you know, we're Americans, we're revolutionary.

844
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000
We rebel against the king.

845
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Maybe made our own country.

846
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000
We won't stand for this kind of, you know what I mean?

847
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.000
That's America.

848
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000
But the thing is it's universal.

849
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:55.000
I feel like it's universal, yeah, because it's kind of like our need for balance.

850
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.000
So you get like someone who just starts out, there's starting point as an underdog,

851
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:04.000
whether it be in a movie or in life or just in any situation that you're presented with.

852
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:11.000
If someone feels like an underdog, it just feels like an imbalance of some sort, power imbalance, whatever kind of imbalance.

853
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:16.000
So we kind of, part of our mind, I think anyway, this is what it feels like when I, in the experience it.

854
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000
Part of your mind kind of wants it to be more balanced.

855
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.000
We want him to get out of that underdog situation.

856
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000
So when he does, it's like it's almost like a feeling of satisfaction, you know?

857
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.000
It's almost like it feels like justice or something like that.

858
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000
It's like it feels so unfair.

859
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.000
I'm balanced at this.

860
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.000
The empires.

861
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000
We just like see the dog went.

862
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Yeah, that's what it is.

863
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Why it is, I think.

864
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000
That's what it feels like.

865
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000
I guess that's the traditional heroic.

866
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
That's what it is.

867
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:50.000
That's the traditional, it's one of the traditional, whatever there are for heroic journeys.

868
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.000
One of those heroic journeys is, you know, David and a lot of,

869
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000
a little guy stands up to the big guy and we all appreciate that.

870
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
We're seeing Rocky Four.

871
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Which are I'll go, is that for you?

872
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

873
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
For sure.

874
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
That was a good one.

875
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

876
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Dynamics of an Insurgency, you got leadership objectives, ideology, environment, geography,

877
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.000
external support and sanctuary, phasing and timing, leadership we know about.

878
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:23.000
One thing they say is extreme decentralization results in a movement that rarely functions as a coherent body.

879
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:34.000
So usually insurgency's are super decentralized, which means they have a hard time sort of coordinating mass movements together.

880
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Objectives, they got to have clear objectives.

881
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:44.000
They got their ideology and narrative narratives, a word that gets thrown around all the time.

882
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
What's the story that we're telling?

883
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Right, and how do we fit everything into the story that we're telling?

884
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Ideas are a motivating factor in insurgency, violence, insurgency's,

885
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:04.000
gather recruits in a mass popular support through ideological appeal recruits are often young men suffering from frustrated hopes.

886
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
And unable to improve their lot in life, it's what I just said.

887
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.000
The insurgency group provides them identity purpose and community and addition to physical, economic and psychological security.

888
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I mean, how just blatantly obvious is that.

889
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:28.000
The movement's ideology explains its followers tribulations and provides a course of action to remedy those ills.

890
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:35.000
You know, yeah, man, again, back to that balanced thing, you know, where we kind of want that.

891
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Like, think about this too, where, okay, there's this place, I don't know where.

892
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I, I really, it wasn't Ireland, I don't think, I don't know, it was somewhere where you get like criminals, bad criminals, murders, like rapists type, guys or whatever,

893
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
and the in jail, and it's not even called jail, I don't think.

894
01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:02.000
It's, it's essentially a rehab center, but in the rehab center, this is what you get. You get like pets and you get, it's essentially like a, for therapy to rehabilitate them.

895
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
So there's punishment and then there's rehabilitation, right?

896
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.000
They focus on no punishment, it's just rehabilitation and apparently from when I read it, whatever, it's like pretty successful.

897
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Here's the thing though, with that, it feels super unsatisfying.

898
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Because you get a guy who raped, you know, a lady, killed her, and then killed the husband or something like that, for example, he goes, no punishment.

899
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:33.000
He goes to this place where he gets pets, he gets, um, he can hang with girls, he can, he can make friends, he gets, like, um, he learns, like, stuff, skills, and stuff like that.

900
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
He doesn't, he's not locked in a cell, he's at a little, like, a little resort kind of thing.

901
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Even even murderers.

902
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Even murders, yeah.

903
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Yeah.

904
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:41.000
100%.

905
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
So yeah, there's no punishment part of it.

906
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
So where's the no satisfaction coming?

907
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:58.000
But if that, the person, the victim of this criminal is like, your wife or something, and this guy gets to go to a resort, you're saying they, the victims have no satisfaction seeing this rehabilitation.

908
01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Exactly.

909
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
They want to go blood for blood.

910
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Yeah, it seems like that imbalance still remains because this guy gets to improve his life after he killed my wife.

911
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Me and one.

912
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Well, sure, it's murderers and everything.

913
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Yeah, that's what I read.

914
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
That's why two of you are so problematic.

915
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I don't know how well that would work here.

916
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Yeah.

917
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Because you get some, you get some vengeance going down.

918
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Oh, yeah.

919
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:27.000
But here was the thing in the point of the article was that there was, like, the, what do you call it when you go back to, like, you go to jail and then you get out, then you go back to jail.

920
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
It's like, we're going back to the city going back to jail.

921
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Yeah.

922
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
A recidivism.

923
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Yes, like relapse kind of thing.

924
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Yeah.

925
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000
The rate was so astronomically good that no one went back to jail.

926
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
It was like that.

927
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
It was like it was so effective at rehabilitating the person.

928
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
But meanwhile, when you think about it, man, there's still this massive imbalance.

929
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
So people wouldn't be very happy with that.

930
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
You seem saying.

931
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Yeah.

932
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:58.000
But as a society, like as a whole, as far as groups, as far as criminals getting rehabilitated, which, I mean, how can you be against criminals being rehabilitated?

933
01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Yeah.

934
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
It's hard to be against that, you know.

935
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
But we still don't get that satisfaction.

936
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
We need that, you know.

937
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
It's like that imbalance.

938
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Yeah.

939
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Well, I just, back to this here, just this idea that you have.

940
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:15.000
And it, it says, you know, young men.

941
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
You know, that's who we're talking about.

942
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000
We're talking about young men that are, that are unable to improve their lot in life.

943
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:32.000
And this is how, how you end up with these people getting drawn into these super, usually extremists type organizations.

944
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
The most powerful ideologies tap.

945
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Layton emotive concerns of the populace, such as the desire for justice, religious beliefs, or liberation from foreign occupation.

946
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Ideologies provide a prison, including a vocabulary and analytical categories through which the situation is assessed.

947
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Thus ideology can shape the movement's organization and operational method.

948
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
You know, it's interesting.

949
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
You start tracking on that.

950
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
What do they call it here?

951
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Vocab just vocabularies, what they call it, but you know, you track any sort of organization that's out there that sort of has a.

952
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:14.000
You know, you look at some, some things you know, that's kind of got a weird culty feeling to it.

953
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:23.000
One of the main things that gives something a culty feeling is when you hear the vocabulary that's all being used and it's all.

954
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Not just used, but it's used as like this weird kind of way to answer any questions and say,

955
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.000
any questions and circular arguments and always comes back to these things and you're like, well, this is getting kind of funky over here.

956
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Yeah.

957
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Well, yeah.

958
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Very strange.

959
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Um,

960
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Environment geography, external support and sanctuaries.

961
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
These are all just really getting into some of the details.

962
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I will stop at this one.

963
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000
No phasing and timing and surgencies often pass through common phases of development, not all.

964
01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:01.000
In surgencies experience such phase development and progression through all phases is not a requirement for success.

965
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.000
So there's different phases that you can go through and like I said earlier, and this way you got to pay attention.

966
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
You don't have to go through every phase.

967
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
You don't start at phase one and go to phase two and then you defeated at phase three.

968
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
No, you can talk about phase two.

969
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
You defeat phase two, they go back to phase one.

970
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Then you take all I think we're in control of the negative two again.

971
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Then they go back and forth.

972
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
You got to pay attention to that.

973
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Talks about insurgent networks.

974
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Here's some of those insurgent vulnerabilities.

975
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Seekersy because they got to keep a secret.

976
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Sometimes they have trouble getting the word out there.

977
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Mobilization it can be hard for them to to mobilize support.

978
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000
For a couple reasons.

979
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000
One of the things they talk about here is to mobilize their base support and surgeon groups.

980
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:59.000
The post-commodation of propaganda intimidation and they may overreach in both counter insurgents should be able to use information operations to

981
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:06.000
effectively exploit in the insurgents message as well as their excessive uses of force for intimidation.

982
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:16.000
So definitely in Iraq the insurgents went overboard in trying to intimidate people and it pissed off the local populace.

983
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.000
And it definitely pissed off the shakes in the battle of Romadi. Like they got pissed.

984
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000
And some of them left fled, some got scared, but some got mad.

985
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:34.000
And the local populace was saying, when I, as soon as they saw that there was enough American presence and Iraqi government presence to say,

986
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
OK, thank you for being here. We'll help you get these back.

987
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Get bad guys out. They were on board.

988
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Financial weakness. It's tough for them to find funding internal divisions.

989
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:54.000
This is an important one to pay attention to counter insurgents must remain alert for signs of divisions within an insurgent movement.

990
01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Again, when you're dealing with a group of people and they're all masked against you,

991
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:07.000
look for those cracks. Look for ways that they're not sort of in unison.

992
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:14.000
And if you can exploit and expand those cracks, all of a sudden you can break down that their unification, which is a positive thing.

993
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
And again, I have this little guilty thing in the back of my head that's I got.

994
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000
I don't want to break down the rebels.

995
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Because I've been programmed by Star Wars to support the rebels.

996
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000
And by the American Revolutionary War, that's why I identify with, we identify with the rebels.

997
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:38.000
You know, tell you an example of that. You've watched the matrix. And I know this is an arm rule. You know, you have this.

998
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I've watched it. I like saw it one time in the theater. So I don't remember much about it.

999
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
So there's this guy, African his name.

1000
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000
The guy from bad boys. Anyway, you know him, he's actor.

1001
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
He definitely knows.

1002
01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:03.000
He's not, what does his name not a pop? Anyway, it doesn't matter. So basically he's, so you know what the matrix is about right.

1003
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Everyone's plugged in the matrix. And then meanwhile, more fierce, Lawrence Fishburn, more fierce saves all these people from the matrix, right?

1004
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:19.000
And the real reality is not the only thing I remember this whole movie is when I think the main character says,

1005
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000
I know jujitsu. I don't remember.

1006
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Trying to get that download. Yeah, you got that. Yeah, for sure.

1007
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.000
So more of he's plugged everyone out of the matrix. Matrix is like everyday life.

1008
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:39.000
You know, I'm just looking at the job and whatever you're living life or whatever, when you get plugged out of the matrix, the real reality is a straight up dystopia straight up.

1009
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Machines running everything. You're living in, you know, in a post-apocalyptic times.

1010
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:52.000
So this one guy, it starts to weigh on him apparently and he's like, I don't even like this. I kind of like to better in the matrix being ignorant.

1011
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:58.000
So he ends up teaming with the agents, which is like the agents of the matrix.

1012
01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Correct, right.

1013
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Is it roll or up?

1014
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.000
And be trained in the rebels. That's what that is right there that when you can, you find little slight divisions and then you exploit on, you know?

1015
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:15.000
And he ran the risk of bringing down the whole team. Same same way, which team? You know, more fierce in the team.

1016
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000
But he wanted to do that, right? Yeah. Yeah. So he didn't run the risk. He could have.

1017
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Yeah.

1018
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Wasn't a risk to him. He wanted to.

1019
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Yeah, yeah.

1020
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000
I'm sorry.

1021
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Did he take the blue pill? Is that right?

1022
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:32.000
No, he wish. He said, and this is what indicates that there was a fracture in it just a little bit of a division.

1023
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000
When he, it was like one of the early scenes with him, he was talking to Neil, the main character.

1024
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And he was like, you're thinking this on paraphrasing. He's like, why didn't I take the blue pill?

1025
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
He was like saying, oh, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that.

1026
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I mean, what I don't know if that's what you, you know, the blue pill is like you stay in the matrix.

1027
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Right.

1028
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Red pill is you see, you know? So basically he was indicating that he was sort of thinking of like that he regretted it a little bit kind of thing.

1029
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
You know, that was like the little fracture that they showed in the story.

1030
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000
But then yeah. So yeah, they almost lost.

1031
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000
But you know, matrix or more fiascent Neil, they're very powerful.

1032
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
They were able to keep it real.

1033
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:24.000
This is the Hollywood podcast with echo Charles and echo Charles aspects of the counter surgery.

1034
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:32.000
This is, so all that kind of it. I hate to say that was like the introduction, but this is where we get into aspects of counter insurgency.

1035
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:38.000
This is how we actually overcome the insurgency.

1036
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:49.000
You know, once every case, the counter insurgent faces a popular containing an active minority supporting a government and a similar militant faction opposing it.

1037
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:59.000
And they kind of lay out, oh, it looks pretty much like a bell curve. Whatever the cause, there will be an active minority that totally supports the cause.

1038
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000
There'll be a neutral or passive. That's the majority of people are just, hey, we don't really care.

1039
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And then you've got an active minority against the cause, which this is something important to think about in life, especially in, well, like right now in America, that you, who do you hear from?

1040
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:32.000
You hear from the two way far extreme ends of the spectrum. Everyone else is just, you know, just trying to live a life and do the right thing and feels, you know, consider things sort of as a group, you know, like all pretty much the same.

1041
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Hey, this is, yeah, this makes sense. This doesn't make sense. This is smart. This isn't smart.

1042
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:51.000
And then there's people on the spectrums, I mean, on the outside of the spectrum that are jumping up and down screaming and getting crazy. They are not the majority of humans. They're small number of people.

1043
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:57.000
But boy, they make a lot of noise. They call them what the vocal minority. Yeah. Yeah.

1044
01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Yeah. I think some, some majority was Nixon originally said that.

1045
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Upon assuming coin mission soldiers and Marines must not only be prepared to identify their opponents and approaches to insurgency. They are applying counter insurgency must also understand the broader strategic context within which they're operating.

1046
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:25.000
So you need to think about the bigger picture. Obviously.

1047
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Historical principles.

1048
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Number one. Legitimacy is the main objective. The primary objective of any counter insurgeon is to foster the development of effective governance by legitimate government.

1049
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:53.000
All governments rule through a combination of consent and coercion.

1050
01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Now think about that from the leadership perspective. All leaders just think of, I said, all leaders rule through a combination of consent and coercion. That makes sense, right?

1051
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Coirs and people do and they're consenting, they're saying, okay, we'll do it. Governments described as legitimate rule primarily with the consent of the governed.

1052
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:24.000
All those rule does illegitimate tend to mainly rely on coercion, like making and forcing people do things, which you probably heard me say this,

1053
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:32.000
an echelon front events, you know, when I, I'm always saying, well, I never really had to order anyone to do anything.

1054
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.000
We would just kind of talk about it and things would happen.

1055
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Why? Because I was legitimately in these positions.

1056
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I was just, I got, I have the rank and that's why I'm in a position like, no, I have some experience. I listen to other people like, that's what's good.

1057
01:14:50.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Citizens obey the state. Oh, this is talking about the illegitimate. So if you're an illegitimate leader, the citizens obey the state for fear of the consequences of doing otherwise,

1058
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:11.000
rather than because they voluntarily accept a rule, a government that derives its power from the governed tends to be accepted by the citizens as legitimate.

1059
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:17.000
So if you're, if you're elected, right? If that's where you got your power from, then it's usually considered a legitimate.

1060
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:24.000
It still uses coercion, for example, against criminals, but the bulk of the population voluntarily accepts its governance.

1061
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:34.000
In Western liberal tradition, a government that derives its just powers from the people and response to the desires while looking out for their welfare is accepted as legitimate.

1062
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
So that's your goal as a leader.

1063
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:45.000
And any time that you rely on a leader, on your rank, on your authority, on your power, any time you're doing that, you're taking away from your legitimacy.

1064
01:15:45.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Legitimate legitimacy makes it easier for the state to carry out its key functions, which include the capability to regulate social relationships, extract resources and appropriate and appropriate or use resources in determined ways.

1065
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:24.000
That is not legitimate isn't inherently unstable because as soon as the state's coercive powers disrupted the population ceases to obey it. This is when you hear me talking about, hey, you might be, you know, if I, if I bark and if I'm your boss and I say echo you better wear your gloves when you're in this compound.

1066
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Or I'm going to fire you, right? You're going to do it, but when I'm not there, you're not going to do it.

1067
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:51.000
So so this is why that type of leadership doesn't work coercive leadership threatening people. That's why it doesn't work. It's not freaking legitimate.

1068
01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:01.000
The leaders of legitimacy can be used to analyze frequent selection of leaders in a manner considered just in fair by a substantial majority of the population.

1069
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:19.000
That includes promotions, right? If people are getting promoted for good reasons that makes sense, then they're considered to be more legitimate. A high level of popular participation in or support for the political process, a low level of corruption.

1070
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000
And you as a leader do things that you know are right.

1071
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.000
When you make little maneuvers that you shouldn't be making, guess what?

1072
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Your level of legitimacy goes down, you need to maintain a high ground, a culturally acceptable level or rate of political economic and social development, a high level of regime acceptance by major social institutions.

1073
01:17:44.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Governments that score high in these categories probably have the support of an adequate majority of population. As as leaders that score well in these areas are also going to have a high level of support.

1074
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Military action can address these symptoms of a loss of legitimacy. However, restoring legitimacy can only be accomplished using all instruments of national power without the host nation government achieving legitimacy, coin cannot succeed.

1075
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:32.000
So you can beat people down all day long. That doesn't give you legitimacy. You can solve tactical problems with military might with brute force.

1076
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Doesn't help you.

1077
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Do you can't win with that?

1078
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:53.000
In a crazy, you think this big military manual, you cannot win with just military force. You cannot beat someone in this submission. It doesn't work. Well, it doesn't work on a long term scale.

1079
01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:22.000
A couple of other things here. Unity of effort is essential. That's true with any leadership. Political factors are primary. One of the generals from Mousée Dung's central committee, one stated that revolutionary war was 80% political action and 20% military action. 80% of it is a political action. 80% of it is maneuvering.

1080
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Understand the local environment you have to do this. Here's a couple. The local population is critical center of gravity of an insurgency.

1081
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Successful conduct of counterinsurgency operation depends on thoroughly understanding the society and culture within which they're being conducted.

1082
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:52.000
The main thing is to understand the following about the population area in the area of operations. How key groups of society are organized, relationships and tensions above them ideologies and narratives that resonate with the groups.

1083
01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Group interests and motivations means by which groups communicate the society's leadership system. And what's so funny about this is.

1084
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:16.000
The national on front when we go and consult with a company, these are the things that we're trying to figure out during our assessment phase. We're trying to figure out, okay, we figured out how their task organized, what's the one they set up like.

1085
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Then we start going one of the relationships where the tensions.

1086
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:32.000
What narratives resonate with the group with the different groups, right? You got the front line leaders that are saying, oh, they never do that. You got the senior leadership that's saying, oh, what would they know.

1087
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:37.000
You see what I'm saying there's the narratives that we're trying to group interest and motivations. You got to know what those are.

1088
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:49.000
It means by which the groups communicate. How do they actually talk to each other? Is there an open line of communication? So these are all things that we look at to figure out how we fix leadership inside of a company.

1089
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Do you do that because like, did you get that straight from here? Or do you just happen to do that and boom this, apparently?

1090
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Well, we don't just happen to do that in order to solve the problems inside of a company. You have to understand these things.

1091
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:13.000
You, you knew that for sure. Yes. Yes. But did you get it from that? I get what you're saying. No, I didn't get it from that.

1092
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:25.000
But when you know the way broadly, you see it and all things. And I'm sure as I work with companies, you start saying, well, how's your relationship with that department over there?

1093
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:36.000
And so, so explain to me what you think, where you think the company's going, right? What's the narrative? Just lines up because you have to figure these things out.

1094
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Do you go in kind of like good cop, bad cop? You know, when you don't have to, you don't have to cop, you don't have to cop, because

1095
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:56.000
everybody knows that we're there to help. Right? There's no, we're not trying to bust them. We're trying to help. Right? Yes. People tell us everything that they, you know, they, they're very open and honest with us.

1096
01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Yeah. Do you, do you ever do like little slie things like, and I guess I shouldn't say, slie because you know how like if you're really trying to ask

1097
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:15.000
this question, but you can't just come out and ask that question because you can't expect them to just come out and give you that straight dope answer. You so you kind of ask these other questions to kind of get a

1098
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:21.000
What you want to know is are there interrogation tactics that are being utilized when interviewing the personnel that we are consulted.

1099
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:29.000
That's your question. Yes, of course. You know, but I mean, it's not there, you're right that they're not slie.

1100
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:37.000
It's like we're getting information from people that they want to tell us. It's not it's not we don't have to set them up or

1101
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Coers them to say things or we don't have to. We talk to them. Yeah. Here's the advantage that we have is people want their company to be successful.

1102
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:56.000
And so when you ask them, hey, what works well, they tell you when you say, hey, are there any issues? They tell you because they want they want to have those issues fixed.

1103
01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:10.000
And the easiest part of the job is gathering this information. Knowing what information to gather is important, but the easiest part of the job is gathering this information because people are over there just they're just more than happy to tell us what's going on.

1104
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Yeah, makes sense.

1105
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Couple things that are required of soldiers and marines at every echelon when you when you need to know about the cultural context.

1106
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:33.000
You got to have a clear nuanced and empathetic appreciation of the essential nature of the conflict.

1107
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:39.000
So you got to hear and listen to both sides. Wouldn't that it does not make sense.

1108
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Yeah, and essentially like had some understanding.

1109
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Like, hey, and empathy. Yeah, yeah, like I could see how you think that I could see where you're coming from.

1110
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Yeah, that's a good idea to have in your head for life or living for being a human.

1111
01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:03.000
It's so true. Like the idea that like someone just doesn't get where that person's coming from.

1112
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
It's almost like, but that's just because a lack of effort, you know?

1113
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000
And here's the deal. You're missing out.

1114
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:19.000
You're missing out. If I argue with you and I don't listen to what you're saying and I don't see what your viewpoint is, there's no way I can defeat you in an argument.

1115
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I don't understand you. How can I defeat you in an argument? Unless I understand where you're coming from.

1116
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:30.000
And not necessarily even defeat you. How can I find a solution if I don't understand where you're coming from?

1117
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
I'm not looking defeat you in an argument. That's what you do when you're 20.

1118
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
That's what you do when you're 23 defeat people in arguments.

1119
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:46.000
When you're hopefully by the time you're 48 like me, you actually don't want to defeat someone you want to find a solution.

1120
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000
There's a lot of arguing that happens. Just broadly.

1121
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I mean, right now we're seeing it all day long every day in the emotional media, social media, mainstream media.

1122
01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:04.000
It's just total, no listening, all talking, no perspective, no empathy.

1123
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.000
It's, well, I shouldn't say no because there are a lot of people that are actually listening.

1124
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Trying to figure out what the solution is.

1125
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000
But, but many people, they don't want to try and figure out what the solution is.

1126
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000
They want to defeat the other person in an argument, which is so pointless.

1127
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:26.000
So then you need to understand the motivation strengths and weaknesses of the insurgents.

1128
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
That's obviously important.

1129
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000
You want to conduct intelligence drives driven operations.

1130
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.000
And meaning we want to actually pay attention to what's going on when a gather good intel.

1131
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.000
I slate insurgents from their cause and support.

1132
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Smart move.

1133
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:53.000
A stabless security under the rule of law, the cornerstone of any coin effort is security for the civilian population.

1134
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.000
And this is probably the number two line that I stole from this.

1135
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Thank you General Mattis. Thank you General Patreis because when I had to start discussing up the chain of command.

1136
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
What we were doing, why were we doing it?

1137
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
It was this line right here.

1138
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:16.000
The cornerstone of any counter insurgency effort is security for the civilian populace.

1139
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Because what we were doing, task in a bruiser, was going out and killing bad guys in order to protect the civilian populace.

1140
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:32.000
And that right there is the cornerstone of counter insurgency.

1141
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:46.000
So we were able to just get all of our missions approved up the chain of command because what we were doing was in support of the cornerstone of counter insurgency.

1142
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Thank you for getting those chapters out early enough that I had this to lean on.

1143
01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:06.000
illegitimate actions, this is just some illegitimate actions by government officials, security forces and multinational partners are those involving the use of power without authority.

1144
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Oh wow.

1145
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Power without authority.

1146
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:22.000
When you use power without authority or you abuse power, you illegitimize yourself.

1147
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Every action by counter insurgency leaves a forensic trace that may need to be used in a court of law.

1148
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Counter insurgency's document all the activities to preserve whatever possible a chain of evidence and more importantly, as it means to insurgent propaganda.

1149
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:46.000
This is epic and I'll tell you why.

1150
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Because inside businesses you make some little move, you make some little move and you think no one's going to know it.

1151
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.000
But it leaves a forensic trace.

1152
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:10.000
And that's just a different way of saying, you know, I am always telling people everyone's watching you and if you try and lie to them, they know it.

1153
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:18.000
That's what's happening. That's 100% what's happening. You try and lie to somebody, they know it. You try and make a maneuver on somebody.

1154
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:26.000
There's a forensic trace and they know it. Don't do your little maneuvers to try and take care of yourself.

1155
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Prepare for a long term commitment.

1156
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Back to that protracted war idea.

1157
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Contemporary imperatives of counter insurgency.

1158
01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Manage information and expectations.

1159
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Achieving steady progress towards a set of reasonable expectations can increase the population's tolerance for the inevitable.

1160
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Inconvenience entailed by ongoing counter insurgency operations.

1161
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000
So just setting good expectations.

1162
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Setting good realistic expectations and then moving towards them so that you can look around at the team and say, hey, look, we're making progress.

1163
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000
This is where we're going and this is how we're getting there. We're making progress.

1164
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Both the insurgency and the host government ensure that their deeds match their words.

1165
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Do what you say, say what you do.

1166
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Here's the other thing that triggered me into talking about this.

1167
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Use measured force.

1168
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Any use of force generates a series of reactions. There may be times when an overwhelming effort is necessary to intimidate an opponent or reassure the populace.

1169
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:46.000
But the type and amount of force to be applied and who wields it should be carefully calculated by a counter insertion for any operation.

1170
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.000
An operation that kills five insurgences counterproductive.

1171
01:29:50.000 --> 01:30:00.000
If the collateral damage of the creation of blood fuels or the creation of blood feuds leads to the recruitment of 50 more.

1172
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Now this was a little bit strange because there was some of that idea that, oh, every time you kill an insurgen, you create five more.

1173
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000
I would definitely hear that. I didn't see it.

1174
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:25.000
What I actually saw was the opposite when we would kill an insurgen, the local populace would be like, okay, it was they got involved and they got braver.

1175
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
They got tougher. They gave us more support.

1176
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.000
What did they say that? What was their thought?

1177
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:42.000
The thought is, hey, you know, if you kill, if you, they see you kill, you know, some kid, some family member, right?

1178
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Some family member gets killed and you think, okay, well, we just created news five brothers and now they're mad.

1179
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:55.000
But actually, oftentimes it was like, hey, don't follow what Freddie did.

1180
01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:02.000
We know what we know he was doing bad stuff and he got killed and they kind of got it.

1181
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:09.000
And I'll tell you what, they also, to a huge extent understood collateral damage.

1182
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000
The local populace understood collateral damage.

1183
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:24.000
So if we blew up a building or blew up a door and we entered a building and it shattered the windows and it turns out that we, you know, it was either the wrong building or whatever.

1184
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000
And we'd say, okay, you know what, hey, here's a bunch of, we'd give them a bunch of money.

1185
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
We'd apologize, we'd say what happened, explain to them.

1186
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.000
And they would be like, yeah, well, you are at war.

1187
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Yeah, you know, they, and they would, and this is how I know that this is real.

1188
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Is it give us information?

1189
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Yeah.

1190
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000
They'd say, oh, yeah, I know you're looking for, you're looking for that guy.

1191
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Yeah, he's, he's been gone for two weeks.

1192
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Yeah.

1193
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000
And then we'd say, yeah, thanks, but we know it's our fault.

1194
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Here's some money.

1195
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Yeah.

1196
01:31:52.000 --> 01:32:01.000
It's weird how like to hear it, you know, because you know, you get whether it be reports or like, you just heard from someone someone who has a different,

1197
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:10.000
I don't want to say agenda necessarily, but, you know, like if someone's against the war or something, like that's kind of their, their deal, you know, so they're kind of trying to input, not input.

1198
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
They're trying to convince that.

1199
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:20.000
And I don't want to paint this, you know, beautiful picture because obviously there's obviously, there's obviously times where, you know, there's one of those brother gets killed.

1200
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
And one of the other brothers says, I'm going to go avenge, you know, go avenge.

1201
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:30.000
But you know what, it's think about in a family, right?

1202
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000
The mom and dad, there's four brothers.

1203
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:38.000
One of the, one of the brothers is out doing insurgent stuff.

1204
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
And he gets killed.

1205
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Yeah.

1206
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:48.000
The mom and dad are looking at the other brothers going, hey, do not go and do what your brother does that happen all the time?

1207
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000
No, not all the time.

1208
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Sometimes the, you know, the dad says, well, avenge, you know, we're go avenge your brother.

1209
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Right.

1210
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Not usually.

1211
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Yeah.

1212
01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:03.000
And then yeah, the point is to where you, you, from the outside, you kind of hear someone's argument and you, and you kind of like, well, that makes sense.

1213
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Yeah, just like you said, where you, where it's like, yeah, the brother got killed.

1214
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.000
If you're probably got killed, you would at the very least have some feelings of vengeance.

1215
01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000
It's a very least.

1216
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Not to mention people who live in a war zone who are down for the fight a lot of the time, right?

1217
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.000
You're going to see their brother get killed.

1218
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
They're like, hell, yeah, I'm going to come avenge.

1219
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
That, that does it.

1220
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000
It's sick out as a lie to me.

1221
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000
It's so, yeah, and it is true. The problem is it's very simplified.

1222
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Yeah, right?

1223
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Because because what's really happened, what's really happening is the dad is going, hey, do you remember Saddam Hussein?

1224
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.000
He was horrible.

1225
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:42.000
These Americans came and kicked his ass and got him out of here and, and now we're moving in the right direction now.

1226
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
You want to go fight them.

1227
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000
What's wrong with you?

1228
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000
And then that guy gets up and killed.

1229
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
And the girls looks at the brothers said, you see what happens?

1230
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Yeah.

1231
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Yeah.

1232
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
And see, and when you explain that, you're kind of like, well, that makes sense.

1233
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000
It's really easy just to stereotype and throw everyone with a broad brush and say,

1234
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Oh, they're, they, everyone thinks like this.

1235
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Yeah.

1236
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000
It's totally not true, man.

1237
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Even in a family, there'd be some kids would be insurgents, some kids wouldn't.

1238
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Yeah.

1239
01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.000
And that's not to mention like some of the terror that these normal families have been, you know,

1240
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Absolutely.

1241
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
inflicted on them.

1242
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
And then it's like,

1243
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Yeah.

1244
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Okay.

1245
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
When you say they understand collateral damage,

1246
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:24.000
just kind of like, the way you said is almost like, and which is actually correct from my perspective,

1247
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000
where it sounds obvious, everyone understands collateral damage.

1248
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000
You know, like, everyone kind of understands that, you know,

1249
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
but so why would we assume that they don't?

1250
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Like everyone should do your thing.

1251
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Exactly.

1252
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.000
So when you say, you're like, well, of course we do humanize.

1253
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Yeah.

1254
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000
We do humanize that local populist and think that, oh, they're just,

1255
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Here's a common emotion.

1256
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000
You blew up my door.

1257
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
I'm mad.

1258
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
I'm going to fight you now.

1259
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
When it's really, when actually you're dealing with human beings,

1260
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.000
and we people forget that we're dealing with human beings that are smart,

1261
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
and they think, oh, you blew up their door.

1262
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Now they're going to want to plan a roadside bomb.

1263
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000
No.

1264
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Actually when you've all of their door and you say, hey, we're looking for this guy.

1265
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000
And he wasn't here.

1266
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Do you know where he is?

1267
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Yeah.

1268
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
He's been gone for two weeks.

1269
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Hey, sorry about your door.

1270
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Here's some money.

1271
01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.000
By the way, we're going to set a team out here and be hang a new door for you,

1272
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000
which we did.

1273
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Yeah.

1274
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
And they go, yeah, appreciate it.

1275
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.000
You know, please, please let your friends know that there's no bad guys that live here.

1276
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
And by the way, the only problems we've had on the street is that building down there.

1277
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
There's been some people in and out of there.

1278
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000
You might want to keep an eye on it.

1279
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Yeah.

1280
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Okay, cool. Thank you.

1281
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Yeah.

1282
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
And see, even hearing that, it's like, brother, that makes sense.

1283
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000
In fact, that sounds more likely if you were in that situation.

1284
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
That's what I'm saying.

1285
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.000
So this idea that every time one, you know, you kill a person,

1286
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000
you kill a bad guy, that now five more.

1287
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.000
That's totally untrue.

1288
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000
And not to mention, there's some people that, oh, shh,

1289
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
I don't want to go get involved with that.

1290
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Right?

1291
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Yeah.

1292
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I mean, that's what they say, there's a high deterrence level.

1293
01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:01.000
There's a very strong deterrence level because what people missed out on is just the,

1294
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
like you said.

1295
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.000
And the way I always explain Iraqi families, I'm like, oh, you wanted to know an Iraqi family is like,

1296
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000
they're like a family.

1297
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Yeah.

1298
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000
They're like a family.

1299
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000
And there's, be, you know, the dad's got this and the mom's got this going on and the kids.

1300
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.46
They've got a rebellious kid, right?

1301
01:36:15.46 --> 01:36:16.68
You go into one of the rooms,

1302
01:36:16.68 --> 01:36:19.78
there's like weird pictures of whatever,

1303
01:36:19.78 --> 01:36:23.26
Iraqi movie stars, music stars,

1304
01:36:23.26 --> 01:36:26.94
and like, they're just people.

1305
01:36:26.94 --> 01:36:31.94
And we just paint them with this broad brush of how we think

1306
01:36:32.58 --> 01:36:36.14
they will react or how we've been told that they'll react.

1307
01:36:36.14 --> 01:36:43.26
And it's just not true. God,

1308
01:36:43.26 --> 01:36:45.58
a learner and a dapped.

1309
01:36:45.58 --> 01:36:47.86
Oh, before I go there, who wields force?

1310
01:36:47.86 --> 01:36:49.86
Who wields force is also important?

1311
01:36:49.86 --> 01:36:52.14
Providing the police have a reasonable reputation

1312
01:36:52.14 --> 01:36:54.34
for confidence and impartiality.

1313
01:36:54.34 --> 01:36:56.30
It is better to let police and these are police

1314
01:36:56.30 --> 01:37:00.14
that are local police handle urban raids,

1315
01:37:00.14 --> 01:37:02.90
rather than soldiers and Marines, even if the police are not

1316
01:37:02.90 --> 01:37:05.86
as well armed or as capable as military units,

1317
01:37:05.86 --> 01:37:07.70
since the populous is likely to view

1318
01:37:07.70 --> 01:37:09.94
that application of force as more legitimate.

1319
01:37:09.94 --> 01:37:12.46
So you want the Iraqis to handle their own problems.

1320
01:37:12.46 --> 01:37:15.54
Now, in Romadi, there was what made it tricky

1321
01:37:15.54 --> 01:37:18.78
is a lot of the Iraqi army soldiers,

1322
01:37:18.78 --> 01:37:21.38
were Shia and the local populist in Romadi,

1323
01:37:21.38 --> 01:37:22.18
was Sunni.

1324
01:37:22.18 --> 01:37:23.86
That's why as quickly as we could,

1325
01:37:23.86 --> 01:37:27.26
we got the Sunni policeman, Iraqi policeman

1326
01:37:27.26 --> 01:37:30.46
that were from Romadi to start doing these kind of things.

1327
01:37:30.46 --> 01:37:31.46
Because there was more.

1328
01:37:31.46 --> 01:37:33.34
In some cases, not in all cases,

1329
01:37:33.34 --> 01:37:35.30
in some cases there was more tension

1330
01:37:35.30 --> 01:37:40.06
between the Shia soldiers and the local populist

1331
01:37:40.06 --> 01:37:42.06
than it was between the Americans and the local populist.

1332
01:37:45.70 --> 01:37:48.06
Learn and adapt, an effective counter-insurgent force

1333
01:37:48.06 --> 01:37:49.82
is a learning organization, right?

1334
01:37:49.82 --> 01:37:55.06
Back to our podcast we did with Dave Burke.

1335
01:37:55.06 --> 01:37:55.94
Good deal, Dave.

1336
01:37:58.58 --> 01:38:01.66
Empower the lowest levels.

1337
01:38:01.66 --> 01:38:05.42
Mission command is the conduct of military operations

1338
01:38:05.42 --> 01:38:09.02
through decentralized execution based upon mission orders

1339
01:38:09.02 --> 01:38:12.26
for effective mission accomplishment.

1340
01:38:12.26 --> 01:38:14.22
What does that mean?

1341
01:38:14.22 --> 01:38:16.50
It means higher commanders and power subordinates

1342
01:38:16.50 --> 01:38:18.34
to make decision with the commanders intent.

1343
01:38:18.34 --> 01:38:20.66
They leave details of execution to their subordinates

1344
01:38:20.66 --> 01:38:22.46
and require them to use initiative

1345
01:38:22.46 --> 01:38:24.02
and judgment to accomplish the mission.

1346
01:38:24.02 --> 01:38:25.86
Decentralized command, thank you.

1347
01:38:25.86 --> 01:38:30.86
Support the host nation.

1348
01:38:31.98 --> 01:38:34.54
And one, the little part I wanted to pull out

1349
01:38:34.54 --> 01:38:36.42
of this support the host nation thing is

1350
01:38:38.10 --> 01:38:39.94
American forces committed to coin

1351
01:38:39.94 --> 01:38:42.74
are there to assist a host government.

1352
01:38:42.74 --> 01:38:44.22
The long-term goal is to leave a host

1353
01:38:44.22 --> 01:38:46.26
that is capable of standing on its own too feet.

1354
01:38:46.26 --> 01:38:47.82
To feet.

1355
01:38:47.82 --> 01:38:51.10
In that end, the host nation has to win its own war.

1356
01:38:53.30 --> 01:38:55.62
Achieving this requires the development of violence,

1357
01:38:55.62 --> 01:38:58.46
local leaders and institutions.

1358
01:38:58.46 --> 01:39:00.30
U.S. forces and agencies can help

1359
01:39:00.30 --> 01:39:02.26
but host nation elements must be able

1360
01:39:02.26 --> 01:39:05.26
to accept responsibility to achieve real victory.

1361
01:39:05.26 --> 01:39:10.26
And then it goes on to warn that you can't be the easy button.

1362
01:39:10.26 --> 01:39:11.94
When something needs to happen, you can say,

1363
01:39:11.94 --> 01:39:12.90
okay, well, where America is?

1364
01:39:12.90 --> 01:39:13.74
We can make that happen.

1365
01:39:13.74 --> 01:39:16.58
No, you need to actually not be the easy button.

1366
01:39:18.70 --> 01:39:19.70
And,

1367
01:39:21.06 --> 01:39:22.90
it's one of the last sections here.

1368
01:39:22.90 --> 01:39:26.58
It's called paradoxes of the counterinsurgency,

1369
01:39:27.58 --> 01:39:29.02
which if I would have named this section,

1370
01:39:29.02 --> 01:39:32.54
what have been called the dichotomies of counterinsurgency,

1371
01:39:32.54 --> 01:39:34.14
but you know what we're saying.

1372
01:39:35.94 --> 01:39:38.66
Principles and imperatives discussed above reveal

1373
01:39:38.66 --> 01:39:42.38
that coin presents a complex and often unfamiliar set

1374
01:39:42.38 --> 01:39:44.58
of missions and considerations for military commander.

1375
01:39:44.58 --> 01:39:46.78
In many ways, the conduct of the counterinsurgency

1376
01:39:46.78 --> 01:39:50.50
is counterintuitive to a traditional American view of war.

1377
01:39:50.50 --> 01:39:52.42
And that right there, that statement is why

1378
01:39:52.42 --> 01:39:54.66
I'm saying, if you're gonna start to overlay

1379
01:39:56.82 --> 01:40:00.70
warfare principles in your business and your life,

1380
01:40:00.70 --> 01:40:03.58
you need to also include counterinsurgency in there

1381
01:40:03.58 --> 01:40:06.22
because sometimes they're counterintuitive,

1382
01:40:06.22 --> 01:40:08.06
sometimes they're different than traditionally

1383
01:40:08.06 --> 01:40:09.22
the way you think of war.

1384
01:40:09.22 --> 01:40:12.14
And I think this attitude, this whole attitude

1385
01:40:13.30 --> 01:40:17.90
is so important to be able to take war fighting

1386
01:40:17.90 --> 01:40:20.30
and overlay it into other scenarios.

1387
01:40:20.30 --> 01:40:24.10
If you only know how to fight a conventional war of attrition,

1388
01:40:24.10 --> 01:40:26.10
you can't overlay those principles

1389
01:40:27.10 --> 01:40:28.74
over either rest of your life.

1390
01:40:28.74 --> 01:40:30.34
They won't work all the time.

1391
01:40:30.34 --> 01:40:31.38
They're not nuanced enough.

1392
01:40:31.38 --> 01:40:32.22
They don't understand.

1393
01:40:32.22 --> 01:40:33.78
They don't understand the complexities.

1394
01:40:34.90 --> 01:40:38.38
And one of those complexities is there's paradoxes

1395
01:40:38.38 --> 01:40:40.62
and there's dichotomies.

1396
01:40:43.02 --> 01:40:45.98
Number one, the more you protect your force,

1397
01:40:45.98 --> 01:40:50.98
the less secure you are. What does that mean?

1398
01:40:52.94 --> 01:40:55.26
Do you have to take risks?

1399
01:40:55.26 --> 01:40:59.22
And when you take risks, when you get outside the wire,

1400
01:40:59.22 --> 01:41:01.06
when you go work with a local populist,

1401
01:41:01.06 --> 01:41:04.26
the more secure you'll end up being.

1402
01:41:04.26 --> 01:41:07.66
So as a leader, if you stay locked up in your office,

1403
01:41:07.66 --> 01:41:08.94
you feel like you're safe in there

1404
01:41:08.94 --> 01:41:12.06
because you're not out there getting engaged with people,

1405
01:41:12.06 --> 01:41:17.06
I'm not gonna ask tough questions, the less secure you are.

1406
01:41:17.06 --> 01:41:18.38
You need to get out there.

1407
01:41:19.70 --> 01:41:22.66
Next one, the more force used, the less effective it is.

1408
01:41:22.66 --> 01:41:25.26
Boom, when you're barking orders,

1409
01:41:25.26 --> 01:41:27.14
when you're yelling at people,

1410
01:41:27.14 --> 01:41:29.82
when you're saying you better do this or all fire you,

1411
01:41:29.82 --> 01:41:33.34
whatever those things are, the more force you use as a leader,

1412
01:41:33.34 --> 01:41:34.54
the less effective it is.

1413
01:41:34.54 --> 01:41:36.22
When you use the minimum force required,

1414
01:41:36.22 --> 01:41:37.50
that's the most powerful.

1415
01:41:38.86 --> 01:41:40.22
The next is the more successful,

1416
01:41:40.22 --> 01:41:43.14
the more the more the force that can be used

1417
01:41:43.14 --> 01:41:45.70
and the more risk that must be accepted.

1418
01:41:47.02 --> 01:41:50.10
So as you proceed down the path,

1419
01:41:50.10 --> 01:41:52.54
you need to use less and less force

1420
01:41:52.54 --> 01:41:54.98
and you have to take more and more risk, which is crazy.

1421
01:41:58.98 --> 01:42:02.42
The initial reaction to the counter insurgency push

1422
01:42:02.42 --> 01:42:05.06
and Ramadi was, enemy attacks are going up

1423
01:42:05.06 --> 01:42:07.46
and American casualties are going up.

1424
01:42:07.46 --> 01:42:08.30
And guess what?

1425
01:42:08.30 --> 01:42:13.30
There's true. So some people up the chain of command,

1426
01:42:13.58 --> 01:42:16.34
not my chain of, well, yes, all up the chain of command.

1427
01:42:16.34 --> 01:42:18.14
Everyone was saying, wait, there's more,

1428
01:42:18.14 --> 01:42:19.06
what's happening?

1429
01:42:19.06 --> 01:42:21.66
There's more enemy attacks and there's more American casualties.

1430
01:42:21.66 --> 01:42:22.50
This isn't working.

1431
01:42:22.50 --> 01:42:24.98
No, actually, that's exactly what's gonna happen.

1432
01:42:30.66 --> 01:42:34.06
Sometimes doing nothing is the best reaction.

1433
01:42:34.06 --> 01:42:38.86
Often an insurgent carries out a terrorist or gorilla act

1434
01:42:38.86 --> 01:42:42.02
with a primary purpose of enticing the counter insurgent

1435
01:42:42.02 --> 01:42:44.62
to overreact or at least react in a way

1436
01:42:44.62 --> 01:42:45.98
that can be exploited.

1437
01:42:45.98 --> 01:42:47.82
If a careful assessment of the effects

1438
01:42:47.82 --> 01:42:50.38
of a course of action concludes that more negative

1439
01:42:50.38 --> 01:42:52.26
than positive effects will result,

1440
01:42:52.26 --> 01:42:54.42
an alternative should be considered potentially

1441
01:42:54.42 --> 01:42:56.38
including a decision not to act.

1442
01:42:56.38 --> 01:42:59.58
Now this is, you know, default aggressive.

1443
01:42:59.58 --> 01:43:00.86
This is not default aggressive.

1444
01:43:00.86 --> 01:43:03.26
Hmm, bias for action.

1445
01:43:03.26 --> 01:43:05.86
This is not taking action, but default aggressive

1446
01:43:05.86 --> 01:43:07.50
and bias for action, bias for action

1447
01:43:07.50 --> 01:43:09.38
what the Marine Corps says they want Marines to act.

1448
01:43:09.38 --> 01:43:11.82
They want them to have a bias to actually do something.

1449
01:43:11.82 --> 01:43:13.42
They want a bias to take action.

1450
01:43:13.42 --> 01:43:15.58
Default aggressive is an echelon front.

1451
01:43:15.58 --> 01:43:17.94
This is me telling young junior officers in the seal team,

1452
01:43:17.94 --> 01:43:21.02
hey, your default has gotta be go take action.

1453
01:43:21.02 --> 01:43:22.22
Make something happen.

1454
01:43:22.22 --> 01:43:25.30
But both bias for action and default aggressive,

1455
01:43:25.30 --> 01:43:29.70
neither one of those say 100% go.

1456
01:43:29.70 --> 01:43:33.10
No, it's default, meaning that's what your default is,

1457
01:43:33.10 --> 01:43:34.38
but you might have to adjust it.

1458
01:43:34.38 --> 01:43:36.02
Bias for action doesn't mean you take action,

1459
01:43:36.02 --> 01:43:38.90
means you lean towards taking action.

1460
01:43:38.90 --> 01:43:41.06
Sometimes you need to look at the situation

1461
01:43:41.06 --> 01:43:42.38
and say you know what's gonna help you?

1462
01:43:42.38 --> 01:43:43.22
Nothing.

1463
01:43:46.22 --> 01:43:50.02
The best weapons for coin do not shoot.

1464
01:43:51.94 --> 01:43:55.10
Counter-insurgents achieve the most meaningful success

1465
01:43:55.10 --> 01:43:57.70
by gaining popular support and legitimacy

1466
01:43:57.70 --> 01:43:59.26
for the host government.

1467
01:43:59.26 --> 01:44:04.26
So how often is it that you as a leader can make more progress

1468
01:44:05.46 --> 01:44:08.62
by instead of telling someone,

1469
01:44:08.62 --> 01:44:09.94
no, we're gonna do it my way

1470
01:44:09.94 --> 01:44:11.82
instead of shooting them in the face without you saying,

1471
01:44:11.82 --> 01:44:13.66
okay, your way sounds good.

1472
01:44:13.66 --> 01:44:16.38
You make you increase your legitimacy

1473
01:44:17.78 --> 01:44:21.74
as opposed to decreasing it when you fire one off in their face.

1474
01:44:25.46 --> 01:44:27.30
The host nation doing something tolerably

1475
01:44:27.30 --> 01:44:30.30
is better than us doing it well.

1476
01:44:31.50 --> 01:44:33.38
Hey, as a leader when you got a support leader,

1477
01:44:33.38 --> 01:44:36.18
you know you can do it better than your support.

1478
01:44:36.18 --> 01:44:38.90
But it's oftentimes better to let them do it.

1479
01:44:38.90 --> 01:44:39.78
Good enough.

1480
01:44:42.70 --> 01:44:45.46
If a tactic works this week, it might not work next week.

1481
01:44:45.46 --> 01:44:47.50
If it works and this province,

1482
01:44:47.50 --> 01:44:49.42
it might not work in the next.

1483
01:44:49.42 --> 01:44:50.98
You gotta keep an open mind.

1484
01:44:50.98 --> 01:44:52.58
You gotta change, you gotta adapt.

1485
01:44:52.58 --> 01:44:57.58
Tactical, success guarantees nothing.

1486
01:45:01.82 --> 01:45:04.62
When Colonel Harry Summers allegedly told

1487
01:45:04.62 --> 01:45:07.58
the North Vietnamese counterpart in 1975,

1488
01:45:07.58 --> 01:45:10.78
that quote, you know you never defeated us

1489
01:45:10.78 --> 01:45:11.94
on the battlefield.

1490
01:45:13.22 --> 01:45:17.30
And quote, the reply supposedly was quote,

1491
01:45:17.30 --> 01:45:22.30
that may be so, but it is also irrelevant and quote,

1492
01:45:24.18 --> 01:45:26.62
military actions by themselves cannot achieve

1493
01:45:26.62 --> 01:45:28.38
a success in coin.

1494
01:45:28.38 --> 01:45:31.22
Tactical actions must not only be linked

1495
01:45:31.22 --> 01:45:34.42
to the operational and strategic military objectives,

1496
01:45:34.42 --> 01:45:39.42
but also to the essential political goals of coin.

1497
01:45:41.90 --> 01:45:44.46
Tactical success guarantees nothing.

1498
01:45:44.46 --> 01:45:47.30
As a matter of fact, it's irrelevant

1499
01:45:47.30 --> 01:45:51.22
in court, in courting to this North Vietnamese kernel.

1500
01:45:54.94 --> 01:45:58.78
Last one, most of the important decisions

1501
01:45:58.78 --> 01:46:00.62
are not made by generals.

1502
01:46:04.30 --> 01:46:08.66
It's the competence and judgment of soldiers and marines

1503
01:46:08.66 --> 01:46:09.70
at all levels.

1504
01:46:09.70 --> 01:46:12.78
Senior leaders must set the proper tone for actions

1505
01:46:12.78 --> 01:46:15.50
by their organizations with thorough training

1506
01:46:15.50 --> 01:46:17.70
and clear guidance and then trust.

1507
01:46:17.70 --> 01:46:19.74
Their subordinates to do the right thing.

1508
01:46:20.82 --> 01:46:23.34
Preparation for the tactical level leaders

1509
01:46:23.34 --> 01:46:25.50
requires more than service doctrine.

1510
01:46:25.50 --> 01:46:27.90
They must also be trained and educated

1511
01:46:27.90 --> 01:46:30.38
to adapt their local situations.

1512
01:46:30.38 --> 01:46:32.38
Understand the legal and ethical implications

1513
01:46:32.38 --> 01:46:34.50
of their actions and exercise subordinates initiative

1514
01:46:34.50 --> 01:46:38.02
and sound judgment to meet their senior commanders in tent.

1515
01:46:38.02 --> 01:46:40.66
You at a company in an organization

1516
01:46:40.66 --> 01:46:45.14
as the CEO, as the CEO, as the president,

1517
01:46:45.14 --> 01:46:47.78
as the guy in charge.

1518
01:46:49.46 --> 01:46:52.78
Most of the important decisions are not made by you.

1519
01:46:52.78 --> 01:46:54.50
They may buy someone out there on the front line,

1520
01:46:54.50 --> 01:46:56.54
so better lead them correctly.

1521
01:47:01.78 --> 01:47:04.66
Little section on successful practices

1522
01:47:04.66 --> 01:47:09.66
and unsuccessful practices.

1523
01:47:11.66 --> 01:47:14.26
I'll read some of the unsuccessful practices.

1524
01:47:14.26 --> 01:47:16.66
Place priority on killing and capturing the enemy

1525
01:47:16.66 --> 01:47:18.66
not on engaging the population.

1526
01:47:18.66 --> 01:47:19.66
What does that mean?

1527
01:47:19.66 --> 01:47:22.26
That means when you have a problem inside your team

1528
01:47:22.26 --> 01:47:25.66
and all you do is attack like whoever you think is doing it,

1529
01:47:25.66 --> 01:47:29.66
that's where your priority is instead of building relationships

1530
01:47:29.66 --> 01:47:31.66
with the group, you're wrong.

1531
01:47:31.66 --> 01:47:36.66
So when you're a little kid and someone,

1532
01:47:38.66 --> 01:47:40.66
I don't know, broke the water heater

1533
01:47:40.66 --> 01:47:43.66
and no one wants to mess up.

1534
01:47:43.66 --> 01:47:46.66
So when your dad comes and says,

1535
01:47:46.66 --> 01:47:50.66
someone tell me or it's your, you'll all get punished

1536
01:47:50.66 --> 01:47:53.66
is that sort of the same thing like you should do that?

1537
01:47:53.66 --> 01:47:57.66
That's collective punishing and I don't really agree

1538
01:47:57.66 --> 01:47:59.66
with collective punishing.

1539
01:47:59.66 --> 01:48:01.66
There are times where it's used for instance

1540
01:48:01.66 --> 01:48:04.66
in team building exercises like seal training.

1541
01:48:04.66 --> 01:48:06.66
Oh, you're gonna get that all day long.

1542
01:48:06.66 --> 01:48:08.66
Oh yeah, one person makes a mistake,

1543
01:48:08.66 --> 01:48:09.66
they're gonna make everyone pay

1544
01:48:09.66 --> 01:48:12.66
and they're doing that actually to create some sort of friction.

1545
01:48:12.66 --> 01:48:13.66
Right?

1546
01:48:13.66 --> 01:48:14.66
What's wrong with you?

1547
01:48:14.66 --> 01:48:15.66
I got out.

1548
01:48:15.66 --> 01:48:17.66
Keep your head under the boat.

1549
01:48:17.66 --> 01:48:20.66
We're gonna keep doing this until Charles gets his head under the boat.

1550
01:48:20.66 --> 01:48:21.66
Really?

1551
01:48:21.66 --> 01:48:22.66
I got out right now.

1552
01:48:22.66 --> 01:48:26.66
Yeah, it's kind of like a two little pronged effect.

1553
01:48:26.66 --> 01:48:28.66
One, you want to put more heat on that guy

1554
01:48:28.66 --> 01:48:30.66
because like letting the team down.

1555
01:48:30.66 --> 01:48:33.66
A lot of times it's more punishment than letting yourself down,

1556
01:48:33.66 --> 01:48:35.66
especially when they're all right there.

1557
01:48:35.66 --> 01:48:39.66
And then the other part is yeah, that friction.

1558
01:48:39.66 --> 01:48:41.66
Then put some stress on everybody.

1559
01:48:41.66 --> 01:48:42.66
You should try to get him.

1560
01:48:42.66 --> 01:48:43.66
You should do it.

1561
01:48:43.66 --> 01:48:46.66
I remember in football, there's like, okay,

1562
01:48:46.66 --> 01:48:48.66
so you know when you, okay, in football,

1563
01:48:48.66 --> 01:48:51.66
you say, you know, you say what's called a cadence,

1564
01:48:51.66 --> 01:48:54.66
you say set down hot or go or whatever,

1565
01:48:54.66 --> 01:48:56.66
the quarterback says it whatever.

1566
01:48:56.66 --> 01:49:00.66
If you jump, if you start before the actual count,

1567
01:49:00.66 --> 01:49:02.66
you know, you call for false or false or false or false.

1568
01:49:02.66 --> 01:49:04.66
I'll decide, yeah, depending on office defense,

1569
01:49:04.66 --> 01:49:06.66
you know, people call different things sometimes.

1570
01:49:06.66 --> 01:49:12.66
So anyway, there are certain drills like to drill that in your head.

1571
01:49:12.66 --> 01:49:15.66
And it's always, it's like an ongoing drill anyway.

1572
01:49:15.66 --> 01:49:18.66
So if, so if we're gonna do like some conditioning or something,

1573
01:49:18.66 --> 01:49:20.66
it'll be in the conditioning.

1574
01:49:20.66 --> 01:49:22.66
So everyone will line up, let's hit windspirants.

1575
01:49:22.66 --> 01:49:25.66
So it'll be like, okay, the count is on three.

1576
01:49:25.66 --> 01:49:29.66
So they'll set down hot, hot, hot, hot on the third, hot, they go.

1577
01:49:29.66 --> 01:49:31.66
Some people still jump off sides during the conditioning.

1578
01:49:31.66 --> 01:49:34.66
So I'm saying it's like a drill that constantly goes.

1579
01:49:34.66 --> 01:49:39.66
So if one guy jumps off sides, everybody pays for it.

1580
01:49:39.66 --> 01:49:43.66
And sometimes the guy who'll jump off sides doesn't pay for it.

1581
01:49:43.66 --> 01:49:46.66
So basically, you just go ahead and sit down.

1582
01:49:46.66 --> 01:49:49.66
Yeah, or basically in a windspirant situation,

1583
01:49:49.66 --> 01:49:51.66
the common thing in our situation would be like,

1584
01:49:51.66 --> 01:49:53.66
okay, let's say it's a 50-yard windspirant, right?

1585
01:49:53.66 --> 01:49:57.66
And you start at the zero yard line and you run to the 50 or whatever.

1586
01:49:57.66 --> 01:50:02.66
So it's the counts on two, set down hot, one guy jumps off side.

1587
01:50:02.66 --> 01:50:04.66
Echo jumps off side.

1588
01:50:04.66 --> 01:50:08.66
Echo stays there, everyone else goes five yards back.

1589
01:50:08.66 --> 01:50:12.66
So now they have the 55-yard windspirant, I don't have the 50.

1590
01:50:12.66 --> 01:50:15.66
I do it again, they go five yards back again, seems same.

1591
01:50:15.66 --> 01:50:19.66
So it like, it puts blame or pressure on you to get it, right?

1592
01:50:19.66 --> 01:50:21.66
So you do learn, I think,

1593
01:50:21.66 --> 01:50:24.66
but some people can get into this weird downward spiral

1594
01:50:24.66 --> 01:50:27.66
because they're so stressed about everyone mad at them now.

1595
01:50:27.66 --> 01:50:29.66
So they don't even think.

1596
01:50:29.66 --> 01:50:32.66
So they can't get their act together, it's funny.

1597
01:50:32.66 --> 01:50:34.66
But it's a good way to create stress.

1598
01:50:34.66 --> 01:50:35.66
Yeah.

1599
01:50:35.66 --> 01:50:40.66
Some of the successful practices, the other unsuccessful practices

1600
01:50:40.66 --> 01:50:45.66
are very military-based conduct-betarian-sized operations

1601
01:50:45.66 --> 01:50:48.66
as the norm, that's too big, concentrate-military forces

1602
01:50:48.66 --> 01:50:51.66
in large bases for protection, we know that that's not going to work.

1603
01:50:51.66 --> 01:50:55.66
Focus special operations forces primarily on raiding,

1604
01:50:55.66 --> 01:50:57.66
like, hey, we're going to go capture kill bad guys.

1605
01:50:57.66 --> 01:51:00.66
That's not where you want to put the focus.

1606
01:51:00.66 --> 01:51:04.66
You can do it for sure, but it can't be the focus.

1607
01:51:04.66 --> 01:51:08.66
So then the some of the successful practices are

1608
01:51:08.66 --> 01:51:11.66
emphasizing intelligence focused on the population,

1609
01:51:11.66 --> 01:51:14.66
their needs and security.

1610
01:51:14.66 --> 01:51:19.66
Focus on the population, focus on the people.

1611
01:51:19.66 --> 01:51:22.66
Expand established and expand security areas,

1612
01:51:22.66 --> 01:51:25.66
isolated surgeons from the population.

1613
01:51:25.66 --> 01:51:29.66
So those are the kind of things that help out place police

1614
01:51:29.66 --> 01:51:32.66
and the lead with military support.

1615
01:51:32.66 --> 01:51:34.66
We absolutely tried to do that.

1616
01:51:34.66 --> 01:51:36.66
We put the Iraqis, we brought the Iraqis with us.

1617
01:51:36.66 --> 01:51:38.66
We put them in the lead.

1618
01:51:38.66 --> 01:51:43.66
So those are some solid successful practices.

1619
01:51:43.66 --> 01:51:46.66
And here's the summary from this first chapter.

1620
01:51:46.66 --> 01:51:49.66
Counter-insurgency is an extremely complex form of warfare.

1621
01:51:49.66 --> 01:51:52.66
Truly war at the graduate level at its core.

1622
01:51:52.66 --> 01:51:56.66
Counter-insurgency war figures a struggle for the support of the population.

1623
01:51:56.66 --> 01:52:01.66
Their protection and welfare is the center of gravity of friendly forces.

1624
01:52:01.66 --> 01:52:05.66
And the decisive terrain.

1625
01:52:05.66 --> 01:52:07.66
This is something that I stole.

1626
01:52:07.66 --> 01:52:11.66
I think this is the third big thing that I stole from this

1627
01:52:11.66 --> 01:52:17.66
to start selling counter-insurgency up my chain of command.

1628
01:52:17.66 --> 01:52:20.66
Was this idea that the center of gravity.

1629
01:52:20.66 --> 01:52:26.66
The decisive terrain in this fight was not an airfield.

1630
01:52:26.66 --> 01:52:27.66
It wasn't a part of town.

1631
01:52:27.66 --> 01:52:29.66
It was the people.

1632
01:52:29.66 --> 01:52:34.66
If we got the people, like when you storm a beach,

1633
01:52:34.66 --> 01:52:37.66
when you get the beach head, you know, you want to get a foothold.

1634
01:52:37.66 --> 01:52:39.66
That's the decisive terrain.

1635
01:52:39.66 --> 01:52:42.66
If you're taking an island, you want to get the high ground.

1636
01:52:42.66 --> 01:52:44.66
Here, it wasn't the high ground.

1637
01:52:44.66 --> 01:52:47.66
It wasn't the beach head.

1638
01:52:47.66 --> 01:52:49.66
It wasn't the airfield.

1639
01:52:49.66 --> 01:52:51.66
It was the people.

1640
01:52:51.66 --> 01:52:55.66
Gaining and maintaining that support is a formidable challenge.

1641
01:52:55.66 --> 01:53:05.66
There are a host of non-military agencies who efforts must be synchronized and coordinated with those of military to achieve these aims.

1642
01:53:05.66 --> 01:53:09.66
And this thing closes out.

1643
01:53:09.66 --> 01:53:17.66
Insurgence are also fighting for the support of the population but are constrained by neither the law of war nor the bounds of human decency.

1644
01:53:17.66 --> 01:53:23.66
They do anything to preserve their greatest advantage, the ability to hide among the people.

1645
01:53:23.66 --> 01:53:29.66
These amoral enemies survive by their wits constantly adapting to the situation.

1646
01:53:29.66 --> 01:53:34.66
To defeat them, it is essential that counter-insurgent forces develop.

1647
01:53:34.66 --> 01:53:44.66
The ability to learn and adapt rapidly and continuously.

1648
01:53:44.66 --> 01:53:53.66
So, learn and adapt rapidly and continuously.

1649
01:53:53.66 --> 01:54:01.66
It seems to be a common theme here on this podcast in the books that we review in the people that we talk to in the lessons that we learn.

1650
01:54:01.66 --> 01:54:06.66
We seem to hear it over and over and over again.

1651
01:54:06.66 --> 01:54:14.66
That's one of the primary and most important attributes of winning.

1652
01:54:14.66 --> 01:54:24.66
So, I think it's pretty clear that you need to take lessons like this and if you can learn to apply them.

1653
01:54:24.66 --> 01:54:27.66
You can't universally apply them, right?

1654
01:54:27.66 --> 01:54:31.66
And it says in the book, it says you can't just universally apply these things.

1655
01:54:31.66 --> 01:54:35.66
You always have to be smart enough to pay attention to run a feedback loop.

1656
01:54:35.66 --> 01:54:38.66
See what's actually happening and adjust.

1657
01:54:38.66 --> 01:54:48.66
And you can only do that by the way if you're humble enough to actually listen to the feedback loop.

1658
01:54:48.66 --> 01:54:54.66
Everything is related. Everything is connected.

1659
01:54:54.66 --> 01:55:10.66
And you can overlay these things into whatever part of your life you need to counter whatever insurgency that you're facing.

1660
01:55:10.66 --> 01:55:23.66
Whether you're on the battlefield, whether you're in business, you're a leader, you're facing an insurgency in your own family.

1661
01:55:23.66 --> 01:55:36.66
And we also have to pay attention to the fact that we might have an insurgency going on inside of us and insurgency of weakness.

1662
01:55:36.66 --> 01:55:38.66
And slough!

1663
01:55:38.66 --> 01:55:42.66
Trying to bring us down. Eccletrails.

1664
01:55:42.66 --> 01:55:43.66
Yes sir.

1665
01:55:43.66 --> 01:55:51.66
Do you have any recommendations how we could fight the internal insurgency that we are facing every single day?

1666
01:55:51.66 --> 01:55:54.66
So it's there. 100% there.

1667
01:55:54.66 --> 01:55:59.66
When you've got to work out planned.

1668
01:55:59.66 --> 01:56:03.66
And then boom, you feel the battle going on inside.

1669
01:56:03.66 --> 01:56:06.66
All the reasons why today should actually, you know what?

1670
01:56:06.66 --> 01:56:08.66
Think about it. Today should be a rest day.

1671
01:56:08.66 --> 01:56:10.66
That's the one side.

1672
01:56:10.66 --> 01:56:11.66
The other side is like nope.

1673
01:56:11.66 --> 01:56:12.66
Shouldn't be a rest day.

1674
01:56:12.66 --> 01:56:14.66
In fact, you're weak right now.

1675
01:56:14.66 --> 01:56:16.66
And let's get stronger.

1676
01:56:16.66 --> 01:56:18.66
Let's push this a lot of physical benefits.

1677
01:56:18.66 --> 01:56:24.66
If you overcome this feeling of not wanting to do the workout and you do it anyway, that's even now you're getting stronger mentally too.

1678
01:56:24.66 --> 01:56:28.66
And you know, but meanwhile it's like boom, it's a little battle.

1679
01:56:28.66 --> 01:56:32.66
The other side is like, but you got all that other stuff you could be doing that you need to do.

1680
01:56:32.66 --> 01:56:33.66
You got this stuff to do.

1681
01:56:33.66 --> 01:56:35.66
If you get that done, boom, you'll be way better off.

1682
01:56:35.66 --> 01:56:37.66
I'm just saying you'll get some recovery.

1683
01:56:37.66 --> 01:56:39.66
And you know, so it's like too battles going on.

1684
01:56:39.66 --> 01:56:40.66
Insurgency in there.

1685
01:56:40.66 --> 01:56:41.66
Oh yeah.

1686
01:56:41.66 --> 01:56:42.66
And there.

1687
01:56:42.66 --> 01:56:43.66
And it's like that.

1688
01:56:43.66 --> 01:56:46.66
When you said that the insurgency in the inside, it's that.

1689
01:56:46.66 --> 01:56:49.66
It's the weak part of it's not going to be before.

1690
01:56:49.66 --> 01:56:50.66
Go ahead.

1691
01:56:50.66 --> 01:56:51.66
Go ahead.

1692
01:56:51.66 --> 01:56:53.66
Let the cat out of the bag right there.

1693
01:56:53.66 --> 01:56:55.66
So if I'm working on something, right?

1694
01:56:55.66 --> 01:56:56.66
Whatever it may be.

1695
01:56:56.66 --> 01:56:58.66
And it's time for the workout or whatever.

1696
01:56:58.66 --> 01:57:01.66
Like that part of me would be like, oh, it just do it tomorrow.

1697
01:57:01.66 --> 01:57:08.66
Do the workout tomorrow because look, you got all this thing that you're in the middle of getting that done is actually better right now.

1698
01:57:08.66 --> 01:57:10.66
Where it's beneficial.

1699
01:57:10.66 --> 01:57:15.66
You know, that insurgency is trying to win the heart and mind of my whole actions.

1700
01:57:15.66 --> 01:57:24.66
Seems like showing me the benefits, you know, of like skipping the workout, but that's kind of evil in a way, you know.

1701
01:57:24.66 --> 01:57:27.66
But yeah, we got to fight against that anyway.

1702
01:57:27.66 --> 01:57:28.66
So yes.

1703
01:57:28.66 --> 01:57:29.66
So what are we doing?

1704
01:57:29.66 --> 01:57:30.66
Well, we're working out.

1705
01:57:30.66 --> 01:57:31.66
Yeah, for sure.

1706
01:57:31.66 --> 01:57:32.66
Don't skip the workout.

1707
01:57:32.66 --> 01:57:34.66
Don't skip your injured skip the workout.

1708
01:57:34.66 --> 01:57:35.66
Today was today.

1709
01:57:35.66 --> 01:57:36.66
This very day.

1710
01:57:36.66 --> 01:57:37.66
Sure.

1711
01:57:37.66 --> 01:57:41.66
I know looking at my weak ahead because what is today of the week.

1712
01:57:41.66 --> 01:57:43.66
It is Saturday right now.

1713
01:57:43.66 --> 01:57:44.66
Yes.

1714
01:57:44.66 --> 01:57:48.66
So I looked at the week ahead and looked at tomorrow.

1715
01:57:48.66 --> 01:57:52.66
I'm pretty booked up tomorrow and the whole week is kind of crazy.

1716
01:57:52.66 --> 01:57:56.66
And I know that we needed to get this done.

1717
01:57:56.66 --> 01:58:01.66
So my first thing, you know, I always wake up at a good morning workout, but I knew I had a priori

1718
01:58:01.66 --> 01:58:02.66
to exercise this.

1719
01:58:02.66 --> 01:58:04.66
And I actually got it done pretty quick.

1720
01:58:04.66 --> 01:58:05.66
I had already read it.

1721
01:58:05.66 --> 01:58:07.66
So now I was going through making notes and whatever.

1722
01:58:07.66 --> 01:58:12.66
And I, but I woke up and did that first before the workout before the workout.

1723
01:58:12.66 --> 01:58:14.66
Because I had to prioritize next few years.

1724
01:58:14.66 --> 01:58:22.66
So now it's like, you know, I spent like three or four hours finishing the reading,

1725
01:58:22.66 --> 01:58:26.66
looking a couple things up and then I was going through, you know, highlighting.

1726
01:58:26.66 --> 01:58:30.66
So now it's like 10 30 or something like that.

1727
01:58:30.66 --> 01:58:35.66
I had a little food and I had all kinds of excuses.

1728
01:58:35.66 --> 01:58:36.66
I locked and loaded.

1729
01:58:36.66 --> 01:58:37.66
So that's got to be eat.

1730
01:58:37.66 --> 01:58:38.66
That's.

1731
01:58:38.66 --> 01:58:39.66
Yeah.

1732
01:58:39.66 --> 01:58:43.66
So what I did was you had a little insurance.

1733
01:58:43.66 --> 01:58:44.66
You going on.

1734
01:58:44.66 --> 01:58:45.66
Yeah.

1735
01:58:45.66 --> 01:58:49.66
And then I just texted you and said, hey, one of Clark, let's do it.

1736
01:58:49.66 --> 01:58:53.66
And I said, as soon as it's, if he, he's, I don't care if he responds,

1737
01:58:53.66 --> 01:58:57.66
I'm just going to get after it before I eat a like legitimate food.

1738
01:58:57.66 --> 01:58:58.66
Yeah.

1739
01:58:58.66 --> 01:58:59.66
Wait, get up.

1740
01:58:59.66 --> 01:59:00.66
That's a little workout.

1741
01:59:00.66 --> 01:59:01.66
Yeah, just went knocked out of workout.

1742
01:59:01.66 --> 01:59:02.66
Yeah.

1743
01:59:02.66 --> 01:59:06.66
Just did sort of a combo workout took me 40 minutes.

1744
01:59:06.66 --> 01:59:07.66
You know what I'm saying?

1745
01:59:07.66 --> 01:59:09.66
Still solid.

1746
01:59:09.66 --> 01:59:10.66
But just had to get it done.

1747
01:59:10.66 --> 01:59:11.66
You know, had to get it done.

1748
01:59:11.66 --> 01:59:12.66
Had to overcome that.

1749
01:59:12.66 --> 01:59:14.66
But in search and see situations.

1750
01:59:14.66 --> 01:59:17.66
Sometimes those insurgents can make good points.

1751
01:59:17.66 --> 01:59:18.66
They do.

1752
01:59:18.66 --> 01:59:19.66
They know what they're doing.

1753
01:59:19.66 --> 01:59:20.66
Yeah.

1754
01:59:20.66 --> 01:59:21.66
They absolutely know what they're doing.

1755
01:59:21.66 --> 01:59:23.66
That's why you got to be able to counter them.

1756
01:59:23.66 --> 01:59:25.66
Um, man, I was thinking this.

1757
01:59:25.66 --> 01:59:26.66
Let's face it.

1758
01:59:26.66 --> 01:59:28.66
In search and see are successful.

1759
01:59:28.66 --> 01:59:29.66
Often.

1760
01:59:29.66 --> 01:59:30.66
Yeah.

1761
01:59:30.66 --> 01:59:32.66
They're not, if you don't know how to counter it.

1762
01:59:32.66 --> 01:59:33.66
You're going to be in trouble.

1763
01:59:33.66 --> 01:59:34.66
Big time.

1764
01:59:34.66 --> 01:59:35.66
What?

1765
01:59:35.66 --> 01:59:38.66
I was yesterday when I was working out the same way.

1766
01:59:38.66 --> 01:59:41.66
You were that one time you're teasing me about squats or whatever.

1767
01:59:41.66 --> 01:59:43.66
You were like, oh, I wonder if it was Scott.

1768
01:59:43.66 --> 01:59:44.66
Remember you're saying that?

1769
01:59:44.66 --> 01:59:45.66
Okay.

1770
01:59:45.66 --> 01:59:48.66
So I was kind of the same inverse reverse whatever scenario where I was like,

1771
01:59:48.66 --> 01:59:50.66
I wonder if Jockel could do this workout.

1772
01:59:50.66 --> 01:59:52.66
Like what if me and Jockel traded workouts?

1773
01:59:52.66 --> 01:59:53.66
Whatever given day.

1774
01:59:53.66 --> 01:59:56.66
And we had to do the same workout.

1775
01:59:56.66 --> 01:59:58.66
Same weight.

1776
01:59:58.66 --> 01:59:59.66
Everything.

1777
01:59:59.66 --> 02:00:00.66
If you can't do it.

1778
02:00:00.66 --> 02:00:01.66
Oh, there's an indicator.

1779
02:00:01.66 --> 02:00:02.66
You can't do it.

1780
02:00:02.66 --> 02:00:03.66
Kind of thing.

1781
02:00:03.66 --> 02:00:04.66
Right.

1782
02:00:04.66 --> 02:00:06.66
If you can't do it, it's an indicator that you can't do it.

1783
02:00:06.66 --> 02:00:08.66
I don't say that.

1784
02:00:08.66 --> 02:00:11.66
I'm saying that's the purpose of trading workouts.

1785
02:00:11.66 --> 02:00:14.66
You know, like you always wonder like, I wonder if I could do that guy's workout.

1786
02:00:14.66 --> 02:00:17.66
I wonder if I could do the, you know, that football players workout, whatever.

1787
02:00:17.66 --> 02:00:19.66
You know, you kind of wonder that everyone's in a while.

1788
02:00:19.66 --> 02:00:21.66
So especially when you see guys working out hard,

1789
02:00:21.66 --> 02:00:24.66
I come under, I think, you know, with these crossfit guys or whatever.

1790
02:00:24.66 --> 02:00:25.66
So that's what I was thinking.

1791
02:00:25.66 --> 02:00:29.66
I was like, I wonder if I, I wonder how I would fare with Jockel's workout.

1792
02:00:29.66 --> 02:00:33.66
Because there's two kind of kinds of like road blocks if you will.

1793
02:00:33.66 --> 02:00:37.66
One is like, if I just can't do the weight, like, let's say your squat is just,

1794
02:00:37.66 --> 02:00:38.66
it's a bigger squat than me.

1795
02:00:38.66 --> 02:00:43.66
You know, so if you got freaking a set of 20, a set of 15, a set of nine and a set of,

1796
02:00:43.66 --> 02:00:45.66
however that goes.

1797
02:00:45.66 --> 02:00:50.66
And you're, again, I got to use your same weight and I simply can't get 20 reps with that weight.

1798
02:00:50.66 --> 02:00:52.66
I just physically can't do it.

1799
02:00:52.66 --> 02:00:53.66
This kind of, okay, there's that.

1800
02:00:53.66 --> 02:00:54.66
That's one.

1801
02:00:54.66 --> 02:00:57.66
Then the other one is like, this is like, I got to tap out.

1802
02:00:57.66 --> 02:00:58.66
This is too hard for me.

1803
02:00:58.66 --> 02:01:01.66
I got to rest more or I got to like, not do 10 sets.

1804
02:01:01.66 --> 02:01:03.66
I can only do like five or whatever.

1805
02:01:03.66 --> 02:01:04.66
You can do it the same.

1806
02:01:04.66 --> 02:01:05.66
There's that too.

1807
02:01:05.66 --> 02:01:12.66
So both of those, and probably there's other stuff too, is like, you wonder, how would I fare in that exact workout?

1808
02:01:12.66 --> 02:01:14.66
Same, you know, weight.

1809
02:01:14.66 --> 02:01:18.66
Like we're, now we're similar weight as far as body weight or whatever.

1810
02:01:18.66 --> 02:01:22.66
So it's like I was wondering that like I wonder if, then I was like,

1811
02:01:22.66 --> 02:01:27.66
first I was wondering, I wonder if I could do Jockel's and I was, then I was thinking, I wonder if he could do mine?

1812
02:01:27.66 --> 02:01:29.66
I don't think I could do yours.

1813
02:01:29.66 --> 02:01:37.66
I think that there's be a venn diagram, whether it be an overlap in the middle where we could both do each other's workouts.

1814
02:01:37.66 --> 02:01:42.66
Then I have some workouts that you wouldn't be able to do, and you have some workouts that I wouldn't be able to do.

1815
02:01:42.66 --> 02:01:46.66
Because of our specialties, right?

1816
02:01:46.66 --> 02:01:47.66
Yeah.

1817
02:01:47.66 --> 02:01:51.66
The metcons, I feel like, I don't know.

1818
02:01:51.66 --> 02:01:53.66
Because yours are more extended, right?

1819
02:01:53.66 --> 02:01:55.66
You're metcons?

1820
02:01:55.66 --> 02:01:56.66
They're probably like what?

1821
02:01:56.66 --> 02:01:58.66
15, 20 minutes or something?

1822
02:01:58.66 --> 02:01:59.66
Yeah.

1823
02:01:59.66 --> 02:02:00.66
More more?

1824
02:02:00.66 --> 02:02:01.66
Yeah, I see.

1825
02:02:01.66 --> 02:02:03.66
So, but they're going to be less intense though.

1826
02:02:03.66 --> 02:02:04.66
Depends.

1827
02:02:04.66 --> 02:02:05.66
Whatever.

1828
02:02:05.66 --> 02:02:10.66
None of the less I was wondering that.

1829
02:02:10.66 --> 02:02:12.66
So maybe one day we're going to see.

1830
02:02:12.66 --> 02:02:14.66
We should straight out have the workout.

1831
02:02:14.66 --> 02:02:16.66
I've respirit built into my workout.

1832
02:02:16.66 --> 02:02:21.66
That's one thing is yours seems more structured.

1833
02:02:21.66 --> 02:02:27.66
You know, I guess not really, because I, but I just basically, I don't have respirit.

1834
02:02:27.66 --> 02:02:29.66
Generally, most of my workouts don't have a rest.

1835
02:02:29.66 --> 02:02:31.66
Like a time where you're like three minutes of rest.

1836
02:02:31.66 --> 02:02:33.66
I don't generally have that.

1837
02:02:33.66 --> 02:02:34.66
Yeah.

1838
02:02:34.66 --> 02:02:35.66
Yeah, I do.

1839
02:02:35.66 --> 02:02:37.66
Because we're all beginning to some other exercise during that period.

1840
02:02:37.66 --> 02:02:40.66
Yeah, which is yet another type of workout.

1841
02:02:40.66 --> 02:02:42.66
You know, like stimulus free.

1842
02:02:42.66 --> 02:02:44.66
Because let's say you're just, let's go, okay, let's go, basic example.

1843
02:02:44.66 --> 02:02:49.66
If you go, you know, five sets of 12, we'll just say.

1844
02:02:49.66 --> 02:02:50.66
Right?

1845
02:02:50.66 --> 02:02:56.66
There's a huge difference with not only the weight you can do, but just over a what you're doing to your body for that workout.

1846
02:02:56.66 --> 02:03:04.66
If you go one minute rest in between those sets and three minutes rest in between those sets, you're doing like essentially you're doing two different things to your body.

1847
02:03:04.66 --> 02:03:04.66
Yeah.

1848
02:03:04.66 --> 02:03:10.66
You know, so it's like, all right, which workout am I doing then that's what that's why rest is kind of set in there.

1849
02:03:10.66 --> 02:03:18.66
But then if there's no rest in between the sets and you program it like, oh, I need to get 500 pull ups.

1850
02:03:18.66 --> 02:03:20.66
I don't care how I get them.

1851
02:03:20.66 --> 02:03:21.66
I just gotta get them.

1852
02:03:21.66 --> 02:03:25.66
I don't know what's not to say, can I guess or whatever or just you just gotta get 500 pull ups.

1853
02:03:25.66 --> 02:03:38.66
It's kind of that's part of the workout too, you know, so it's like it's almost like it's you're doing a specific thing to your body there too, you know, so it's like that fits, you know, you don't have to have rest periods.

1854
02:03:38.66 --> 02:03:41.66
I program them in for a reason.

1855
02:03:41.66 --> 02:03:46.66
Yeah, no, you have a specific purpose, but nonetheless.

1856
02:03:46.66 --> 02:03:49.66
Oh yeah, all right, no, no, the last I forgot.

1857
02:03:49.66 --> 02:03:52.66
Yeah, someone to tell people how we can stay on the path.

1858
02:03:52.66 --> 02:03:59.66
Yeah, effectively healthy and you know, effectively and healthy.

1859
02:03:59.66 --> 02:04:03.66
Anyway, yes, so when you're working out, you can need need fuel, eat good.

1860
02:04:03.66 --> 02:04:08.66
80, 20 is good, 80% clean, 20% freedom.

1861
02:04:08.66 --> 02:04:10.66
80% discipline, 20% freedom.

1862
02:04:10.66 --> 02:04:11.66
Yeah, interesting.

1863
02:04:11.66 --> 02:04:13.66
Well, that's recommended.

1864
02:04:13.66 --> 02:04:17.66
You can go 910, you start going 70, 30, then you, that's a slippery slope.

1865
02:04:17.66 --> 02:04:18.66
That's what I think.

1866
02:04:18.66 --> 02:04:24.66
Nonetheless, you want supplementation for your joints, for your brain, for even protein supplements,

1867
02:04:24.66 --> 02:04:28.66
but when you got you jockel fuel supplements, joint warfare, or rejoin to obviously

1868
02:04:28.66 --> 02:04:34.66
krill oil, make a 3's all day and antioxidants by the way.

1869
02:04:34.66 --> 02:04:37.66
Also discipline and discipline go, which is essentially the same thing.

1870
02:04:37.66 --> 02:04:40.66
Different delivery systems.

1871
02:04:40.66 --> 02:04:43.66
Cance and powders.

1872
02:04:43.66 --> 02:04:44.66
It's true.

1873
02:04:44.66 --> 02:04:49.66
And it can pills.

1874
02:04:49.66 --> 02:04:53.66
Because I told, I told B little at the beginning.

1875
02:04:53.66 --> 02:04:54.66
So we started making discipline.

1876
02:04:54.66 --> 02:04:56.66
I said, hey man, this is really good stuff.

1877
02:04:56.66 --> 02:05:00.66
Yeah, this is exactly what I, this is what we want, right?

1878
02:05:00.66 --> 02:05:01.66
Yes.

1879
02:05:01.66 --> 02:05:06.66
I said, but I, I talk for a long period of time for living.

1880
02:05:06.66 --> 02:05:13.66
And if I have to drink this to get my, get that hitter,

1881
02:05:13.66 --> 02:05:17.66
if I have to drink this before I go out and start talking.

1882
02:05:17.66 --> 02:05:19.66
And then all of a sudden, I got to go to the bathroom.

1883
02:05:19.66 --> 02:05:20.66
I said, I need a pill.

1884
02:05:20.66 --> 02:05:21.66
I told him.

1885
02:05:21.66 --> 02:05:22.66
I said, I said, put this stuff in a pill.

1886
02:05:22.66 --> 02:05:25.66
He goes, okay, and he made, what is it called?

1887
02:05:25.66 --> 02:05:30.66
It's a compressed, not a capsule, but like a compressed thing, whatever.

1888
02:05:30.66 --> 02:05:32.66
And I don't really like those.

1889
02:05:32.66 --> 02:05:33.66
Oh, for real?

1890
02:05:33.66 --> 02:05:34.66
So then I had to get him back.

1891
02:05:34.66 --> 02:05:35.66
Let him go.

1892
02:05:35.66 --> 02:05:36.66
So it broke.

1893
02:05:36.66 --> 02:05:38.66
And he goes, he said, you said, you said, pill.

1894
02:05:38.66 --> 02:05:41.66
And I said, I thought the, a capsule was a pill.

1895
02:05:41.66 --> 02:05:44.66
To me, that's the same thing. You take a pill, right?

1896
02:05:44.66 --> 02:05:47.66
I didn't know that a pill was a, whatever that compressed thing is.

1897
02:05:47.66 --> 02:05:49.66
And a capsule was something different.

1898
02:05:49.66 --> 02:05:49.66
Yes.

1899
02:05:49.66 --> 02:05:53.66
But if you need that little, like, you need it.

1900
02:05:53.66 --> 02:05:55.66
Boom, you can take a, the capsule.

1901
02:05:55.66 --> 02:06:00.66
A capsule, a disciplined pill, not a gel cap, which actually this stem from.

1902
02:06:00.66 --> 02:06:04.66
So, I forget what happened in the world,

1903
02:06:04.66 --> 02:06:10.66
but there was controversy about veterans and drugs.

1904
02:06:10.66 --> 02:06:11.66
And drugs.

1905
02:06:11.66 --> 02:06:16.66
And someone was saying something like, you know, what do you expect to happen when

1906
02:06:16.66 --> 02:06:20.66
these put all these vets on drugs, put on, and fedemines?

1907
02:06:20.66 --> 02:06:23.66
And I said, I said, we're not on a fedemines and he goes,

1908
02:06:23.66 --> 02:06:25.66
Prylets take him, fedemines.

1909
02:06:25.66 --> 02:06:30.66
And I said, I texted Dave Burke.

1910
02:06:30.66 --> 02:06:31.66
Yeah, good deal to you.

1911
02:06:31.66 --> 02:06:32.66
Yeah.

1912
02:06:32.66 --> 02:06:36.66
And I said, I said, do they give you guys and fedemines to take?

1913
02:06:36.66 --> 02:06:37.66
And he goes, no.

1914
02:06:37.66 --> 02:06:40.66
I mean, this is all of within, this is on Twitter.

1915
02:06:40.66 --> 02:06:42.66
This is probably two years ago.

1916
02:06:42.66 --> 02:06:43.66
He goes, no.

1917
02:06:43.66 --> 02:06:46.66
And so I go back to the guy, I go, no, they never give pilots and fedemines.

1918
02:06:46.66 --> 02:06:47.66
And then I get it.

1919
02:06:47.66 --> 02:06:50.66
And as soon as I tweeted that, Dave Burke.

1920
02:06:50.66 --> 02:06:51.66
Good deal to you.

1921
02:06:51.66 --> 02:06:53.66
Yeah, he goes back to you as pro.

1922
02:06:53.66 --> 02:06:54.66
I just screwed you.

1923
02:06:54.66 --> 02:06:56.66
He said, he's like, bro, I just screwed you.

1924
02:06:56.66 --> 02:06:57.66
And I was like, what?

1925
02:06:57.66 --> 02:06:59.66
He goes, he goes, they definitely give it to us tonight.

1926
02:06:59.66 --> 02:07:02.66
And I was like, and I, I was like, Roger.

1927
02:07:02.66 --> 02:07:04.66
I said, hey, what's, I was wrong.

1928
02:07:04.66 --> 02:07:05.66
But guess what they call him?

1929
02:07:05.66 --> 02:07:07.66
What?

1930
02:07:07.66 --> 02:07:08.66
Go pills.

1931
02:07:08.66 --> 02:07:09.66
Okay.

1932
02:07:09.66 --> 02:07:11.66
So that's what I was saying to be little.

1933
02:07:11.66 --> 02:07:14.66
I'll just say, hey, man, we need go pills.

1934
02:07:14.66 --> 02:07:19.66
No, we don't need, and fedemines in the, in fact, we do not want and fedemines.

1935
02:07:19.66 --> 02:07:24.66
But we do want the feeling that discipline and the, the, the, the

1936
02:07:24.66 --> 02:07:27.66
Discipline powder gives you a little cognitive kick.

1937
02:07:27.66 --> 02:07:29.66
Yeah, little, little get up and go.

1938
02:07:29.66 --> 02:07:30.66
Yes.

1939
02:07:30.66 --> 02:07:31.66
That's why we call it this one.

1940
02:07:31.66 --> 02:07:32.66
Go.

1941
02:07:32.66 --> 02:07:33.66
Anyway, there you go.

1942
02:07:33.66 --> 02:07:34.66
That's a little information behind that.

1943
02:07:34.66 --> 02:07:38.66
We got chocolate, we got milk, strawberry, chocolate for kids.

1944
02:07:38.66 --> 02:07:40.66
We got mint, peanut butter, the whole nine yards.

1945
02:07:40.66 --> 02:07:42.66
It's true.

1946
02:07:42.66 --> 02:07:46.66
And all the stuff is available, the vitamin shop, or it's available at

1947
02:07:46.66 --> 02:07:49.66
OrgeneMaine.com.

1948
02:07:49.66 --> 02:07:53.66
You know, speaking of origin, main other things on there besides

1949
02:07:53.66 --> 02:07:56.66
Chocolate field, like, geysin rashguards for a

1950
02:07:56.66 --> 02:07:59.66
Gigi to one, we go back to Gigi to, if we haven't already.

1951
02:07:59.66 --> 02:08:00.66
We're kind of getting back there.

1952
02:08:00.66 --> 02:08:01.66
Boom.

1953
02:08:01.66 --> 02:08:03.66
I think there's a, a underground mode.

1954
02:08:03.66 --> 02:08:05.66
There's definitely people training.

1955
02:08:05.66 --> 02:08:07.66
Yeah, that's JP training.

1956
02:08:07.66 --> 02:08:08.66
Texas is open.

1957
02:08:08.66 --> 02:08:09.66
Yeah.

1958
02:08:09.66 --> 02:08:13.66
Yeah, there's, I think I heard a thing that gyms are opening,

1959
02:08:13.66 --> 02:08:16.66
June 15th or something like this.

1960
02:08:16.66 --> 02:08:18.66
They opened with a bunch of restrictions.

1961
02:08:18.66 --> 02:08:19.66
Yeah.

1962
02:08:19.66 --> 02:08:21.66
So yeah, but we're getting there.

1963
02:08:21.66 --> 02:08:23.66
Yeah, coming out from the underground for sure.

1964
02:08:23.66 --> 02:08:24.66
So you have to need a new Gigi.

1965
02:08:24.66 --> 02:08:27.66
Yeah, origin Gigi best ones factually in the world, by the way.

1966
02:08:27.66 --> 02:08:30.66
And fully in America, of course.

1967
02:08:30.66 --> 02:08:33.66
Which is kind of important right now.

1968
02:08:33.66 --> 02:08:38.66
You want to get your stuff that's made in America not made in China.

1969
02:08:38.66 --> 02:08:42.66
Yeah, that's why I recommend it anyways.

1970
02:08:42.66 --> 02:08:43.66
Okay.

1971
02:08:43.66 --> 02:08:44.66
Don't forget about jeans.

1972
02:08:44.66 --> 02:08:47.66
Don't forget about boots.

1973
02:08:47.66 --> 02:08:54.66
Don't forget about t-shirts, hoodies, and don't forget about joggers.

1974
02:08:54.66 --> 02:08:55.66
Unless you're me.

1975
02:08:55.66 --> 02:08:56.66
If you me, don't get joggers.

1976
02:08:56.66 --> 02:08:57.66
Yeah, just forget about it.

1977
02:08:57.66 --> 02:08:58.66
Yeah, don't worry.

1978
02:08:58.66 --> 02:09:08.66
There's a whole, a whole just, a whole can, there's a whole just plethora of reasons why

1979
02:09:08.66 --> 02:09:11.66
if your name is Joko, don't get joggers.

1980
02:09:11.66 --> 02:09:12.66
They just don't want it.

1981
02:09:12.66 --> 02:09:13.66
Yeah, don't get it.

1982
02:09:13.66 --> 02:09:14.66
Just don't get it.

1983
02:09:14.66 --> 02:09:15.66
Don't put them on.

1984
02:09:15.66 --> 02:09:16.66
Just if your name is echo Charles.

1985
02:09:16.66 --> 02:09:17.66
Oh, oh, thank.

1986
02:09:17.66 --> 02:09:18.66
All joggers.

1987
02:09:18.66 --> 02:09:19.66
Oh, yes, sir.

1988
02:09:19.66 --> 02:09:22.66
Yes, or do you mean dot com also.

1989
02:09:22.66 --> 02:09:24.66
Joko is a store.

1990
02:09:24.66 --> 02:09:26.66
That's called joko store.

1991
02:09:26.66 --> 02:09:33.66
That's where you can get your shirts, custom shirts.

1992
02:09:33.66 --> 02:09:38.66
Maybe you stretching that word custom for, but nonetheless, you can't represent this when

1993
02:09:38.66 --> 02:09:39.66
you go to read them good.

1994
02:09:39.66 --> 02:09:40.66
Take pie grunk.

1995
02:09:40.66 --> 02:09:41.66
I don't take you.

1996
02:09:41.66 --> 02:09:42.66
Get after it.

1997
02:09:42.66 --> 02:09:43.66
It's a good one.

1998
02:09:43.66 --> 02:09:48.66
Anyway, shirts that will represent on the path while you're on.

1999
02:09:48.66 --> 02:09:49.66
The path.

2000
02:09:49.66 --> 02:09:51.66
Anyway, it's a mess.

2001
02:09:51.66 --> 02:09:52.66
I'm asking other cool stuff.

2002
02:09:52.66 --> 02:09:55.66
So yeah, if you like something, get something.

2003
02:09:55.66 --> 02:09:58.66
We have an email list.

2004
02:09:58.66 --> 02:10:01.66
Here's the thing.

2005
02:10:01.66 --> 02:10:09.66
I always feel kind of odd for lack of better term saying, hey, sign up on for our email list.

2006
02:10:09.66 --> 02:10:11.66
It feels weird saying that.

2007
02:10:11.66 --> 02:10:15.66
Well, that's because you have been conditioned in your life that every time somebody told you that

2008
02:10:15.66 --> 02:10:18.66
and you did it, you got a bunch of junk.

2009
02:10:18.66 --> 02:10:23.66
Yes, and I don't want to say spam necessarily, but yeah, it's one of these things where

2010
02:10:23.66 --> 02:10:24.66
I'm down.

2011
02:10:24.66 --> 02:10:26.66
I am down for the email list, 100%.

2012
02:10:26.66 --> 02:10:30.66
If I'm like, oh, wait, I do want updates on this stuff right here.

2013
02:10:30.66 --> 02:10:31.66
I'm down.

2014
02:10:31.66 --> 02:10:34.66
I'm not conditioned necessarily against it, but here's the thing.

2015
02:10:34.66 --> 02:10:39.66
I have felt the sting of signing up for the email list, hoping that I'll be updated

2016
02:10:39.66 --> 02:10:43.66
with like new cool stuff that they offer or whatever, but meanwhile, they're sending me like,

2017
02:10:43.66 --> 02:10:46.66
oh, happy Valentine's Day from XYZ.com.

2018
02:10:46.66 --> 02:10:51.66
It's like, bro, I don't care, but you wishing me happy Valentine's Day in my email inbox.

2019
02:10:51.66 --> 02:10:54.66
Which, let's face it, are email inbox for most of them.

2020
02:10:54.66 --> 02:10:59.66
For some of us, we'll say, I think most of us, but whatever, are email inboxes kind of sacred,

2021
02:10:59.66 --> 02:11:02.66
like, proud stay out of there if you don't have something to look at.

2022
02:11:02.66 --> 02:11:04.66
That's the way it should be.

2023
02:11:04.66 --> 02:11:05.66
Yeah.

2024
02:11:05.66 --> 02:11:12.66
So anyway, my point there is if, if you sign up for this, if you're saying all this now, you're going to tell everyone that you sign up for the email.

2025
02:11:12.66 --> 02:11:15.66
I'm not saying anyone should do anything, ever.

2026
02:11:15.66 --> 02:11:19.66
Maybe not ever, but I'm not saying in this case, but I'm saying, we do have an email list.

2027
02:11:19.66 --> 02:11:28.66
If you do want updates and here's basically what we'll send out is like, if there's a new design or a new hoodie or a new whatever.

2028
02:11:28.66 --> 02:11:31.66
That's it, pretty much for the store.

2029
02:11:31.66 --> 02:11:38.66
With the occasional, and when I say occasional, I mean, very occasional exception, where if there's like some important announcement.

2030
02:11:38.66 --> 02:11:42.66
And important is like, there, it has to be very important.

2031
02:11:42.66 --> 02:11:45.66
What's an example of an important announcement that's come out on the email list?

2032
02:11:45.66 --> 02:11:46.66
Because I'm on this.

2033
02:11:46.66 --> 02:11:49.66
I'm on this. Come out. Yeah. None. Okay, that's right.

2034
02:11:49.66 --> 02:11:51.66
I love to say I haven't gotten any more.

2035
02:11:51.66 --> 02:11:53.66
Yes. I'm just saying that control.

2036
02:11:53.66 --> 02:11:54.66
No, no, no.

2037
02:11:54.66 --> 02:12:05.66
None have been, but I'm saying if there was like, hey, freaking no podcast for one month or something that like, I would anticipate a bunch of people training email.

2038
02:12:05.66 --> 02:12:12.66
Me or you about, then maybe, but I mean, I can't think of anything off hand specifically, but it'll be real important.

2039
02:12:12.66 --> 02:12:15.66
I think I will firmly believe that it's important.

2040
02:12:15.66 --> 02:12:21.66
Otherwise, you're just going to get new stuff every what once a month, maybe once every two, three months.

2041
02:12:21.66 --> 02:12:22.66
Yes. Maybe.

2042
02:12:22.66 --> 02:12:24.66
Anyway, I'm not going to be easy.

2043
02:12:24.66 --> 02:12:27.66
That's what I'm saying. I realize that everyone's inbox is sacred.

2044
02:12:27.66 --> 02:12:35.66
Where do they sign up for this email address listing on joccostore.com at the bottom?

2045
02:12:35.66 --> 02:12:39.66
Should I make some kind of an email?

2046
02:12:39.66 --> 02:12:41.66
Hey, no, no, no.

2047
02:12:41.66 --> 02:12:45.66
Okay. I don't think so. You know, leave everybody alone.

2048
02:12:45.66 --> 02:12:47.66
That's like what people are all into.

2049
02:12:47.66 --> 02:12:48.66
Oh, you should.

2050
02:12:48.66 --> 02:12:52.66
Yeah, and I dig it. That's like the, what do you call it?

2051
02:12:52.66 --> 02:12:56.66
Have you ever gotten an email from somebody that's like, like, you sign up for an email list?

2052
02:12:56.66 --> 02:13:04.66
And then you get an email, but it says it's from the person you go, oh, it's from someone so, but then it's just a massive mail.

2053
02:13:04.66 --> 02:13:09.66
Yeah. Well, because sometimes it is from that person, but it is a massive mail.

2054
02:13:09.66 --> 02:13:12.66
Okay. But sometimes it's from like their marketing company.

2055
02:13:12.66 --> 02:13:13.66
Yeah. Whatever.

2056
02:13:13.66 --> 02:13:15.66
Those are the ones that I go, come on, man.

2057
02:13:15.66 --> 02:13:16.66
Yeah, but I felt all good.

2058
02:13:16.66 --> 02:13:19.66
But well, this one is good because this is actually from me.

2059
02:13:19.66 --> 02:13:22.66
Yeah. So I'll try to make it look cool and official.

2060
02:13:22.66 --> 02:13:26.66
You know, the cool pictures on there, but, but yes, it is coming for me.

2061
02:13:26.66 --> 02:13:28.66
I have friends.

2062
02:13:28.66 --> 02:13:29.66
Yes.

2063
02:13:29.66 --> 02:13:32.66
That, you know, kind of have email list, right?

2064
02:13:32.66 --> 02:13:33.66
Yeah.

2065
02:13:33.66 --> 02:13:33.66
Sure.

2066
02:13:33.66 --> 02:13:36.66
And, and I'm on their email list.

2067
02:13:36.66 --> 02:13:41.66
Yeah. But then I'm also have, you know, will exchange personally emails, right?

2068
02:13:41.66 --> 02:13:41.66
Right.

2069
02:13:41.66 --> 02:13:43.66
About whatever topic.

2070
02:13:43.66 --> 02:13:48.66
And it got get an email from like an email, I'll show up and I go, oh, oh, that's cool.

2071
02:13:48.66 --> 02:13:51.66
So, and then I open up and it's one of those things.

2072
02:13:51.66 --> 02:13:52.66
It's always like, oh, dude.

2073
02:13:52.66 --> 02:13:53.66
That's a bummer.

2074
02:13:53.66 --> 02:13:54.66
Yeah.

2075
02:13:54.66 --> 02:13:55.66
What do you mean, like Sam Harris?

2076
02:13:55.66 --> 02:13:56.66
Just whoever.

2077
02:13:56.66 --> 02:13:57.66
Oh, yeah.

2078
02:13:57.66 --> 02:13:57.66
You name him.

2079
02:13:57.66 --> 02:14:00.66
I signed up for Sam Harris's email list, but it was,

2080
02:14:00.66 --> 02:14:03.66
happened to be at the same time where I sort of like,

2081
02:14:03.66 --> 02:14:06.66
met him in sort of like, no, and then I seen it like from Sam Harris.

2082
02:14:06.66 --> 02:14:07.66
I was like, yes.

2083
02:14:07.66 --> 02:14:09.66
Sam Harris is emailing in, then it's like his podcast thing.

2084
02:14:09.66 --> 02:14:11.66
I was like, I felt that.

2085
02:14:11.66 --> 02:14:12.66
It was cool.

2086
02:14:12.66 --> 02:14:13.66
I signed up for a reason.

2087
02:14:13.66 --> 02:14:17.66
So I was like, but that expectation that it's actually him emailing you being like,

2088
02:14:17.66 --> 02:14:19.66
Hey, great to meet you or something like this, you know?

2089
02:14:19.66 --> 02:14:20.66
Yeah.

2090
02:14:20.66 --> 02:14:20.66
Yeah.

2091
02:14:20.66 --> 02:14:21.66
Kind of.

2092
02:14:21.66 --> 02:14:21.66
That's funny.

2093
02:14:21.66 --> 02:14:25.66
No, I get it, but I get, you know, quite a few friends like that,

2094
02:14:25.66 --> 02:14:29.66
you know, where, and you know, I don't, I'm not a big communicator.

2095
02:14:29.66 --> 02:14:31.66
And I don't have a ton of friends anyways.

2096
02:14:31.66 --> 02:14:35.66
So when I do get emails from my friends, it's always, because I get a lot of business emails,

2097
02:14:35.66 --> 02:14:39.66
obviously, but then when people email my personally email, you know,

2098
02:14:39.66 --> 02:14:43.66
and I go, oh, and then I see that it's a form of me, my God.

2099
02:14:43.66 --> 02:14:45.66
Oh, well, well,

2100
02:14:45.66 --> 02:14:47.66
I mean, that quite is a say to you.

2101
02:14:47.66 --> 02:14:51.66
But sometimes it has spurred me to email them, right?

2102
02:14:51.66 --> 02:14:54.66
I've gone, you know, and then they email me back and we have a cool

2103
02:14:54.66 --> 02:14:55.66
something.

2104
02:14:55.66 --> 02:14:56.66
Oh, it reminds me.

2105
02:14:56.66 --> 02:14:57.66
Yeah.

2106
02:14:57.66 --> 02:15:00.66
I say, well, it gave me that feeling like, oh, that's cool to hear from this person or that person.

2107
02:15:00.66 --> 02:15:03.66
Maybe they were thinking the same thing.

2108
02:15:03.66 --> 02:15:05.66
Why am I not email them?

2109
02:15:05.66 --> 02:15:08.66
Who am I supposed to not, not taking an initiative here?

2110
02:15:08.66 --> 02:15:08.66
Yeah.

2111
02:15:08.66 --> 02:15:12.66
So then I'll take some initiative and say, hey, I listen to your last podcast or hey,

2112
02:15:12.66 --> 02:15:13.66
I saw you do that thing.

2113
02:15:13.66 --> 02:15:14.66
And they go, oh, cool.

2114
02:15:14.66 --> 02:15:15.66
You know what I mean?

2115
02:15:15.66 --> 02:15:16.66
Yeah.

2116
02:15:16.66 --> 02:15:21.66
So it's a little indirect prompt to kind of relate to people.

2117
02:15:21.66 --> 02:15:23.66
Yeah, reach out, man.

2118
02:15:23.66 --> 02:15:24.66
Yeah.

2119
02:15:24.66 --> 02:15:25.66
Can't pick up a phone.

2120
02:15:25.66 --> 02:15:26.66
Yeah.

2121
02:15:26.66 --> 02:15:27.66
It's true.

2122
02:15:27.66 --> 02:15:28.66
All right.

2123
02:15:28.66 --> 02:15:29.66
Well, nonetheless, there you go.

2124
02:15:29.66 --> 02:15:30.66
So yeah, jockelster.com.

2125
02:15:30.66 --> 02:15:32.66
That's where all this stuff is.

2126
02:15:32.66 --> 02:15:37.66
Also, if you want to subscribe to the podcast on iTunes, I don't

2127
02:15:37.66 --> 02:15:40.66
know, sounds kind of weird because you're probably already are subscribed.

2128
02:15:40.66 --> 02:15:41.66
Maybe maybe not, I don't know.

2129
02:15:41.66 --> 02:15:42.66
I have a question.

2130
02:15:42.66 --> 02:15:43.66
Yeah.

2131
02:15:43.66 --> 02:15:43.66
Yeah.

2132
02:15:43.66 --> 02:15:44.66
You of course.

2133
02:15:44.66 --> 02:15:44.66
Yeah.

2134
02:15:44.66 --> 02:15:45.66
Me too.

2135
02:15:45.66 --> 02:15:47.66
But if you're not subscribed, you want to subscribe, boom.

2136
02:15:47.66 --> 02:15:51.66
Let me remind you that that option is available for you.

2137
02:15:51.66 --> 02:15:53.66
We also have some other podcasts.

2138
02:15:53.66 --> 02:15:57.66
We have a podcast formerly known as the thread, which I was this close to renaming.

2139
02:15:57.66 --> 02:16:00.66
And I didn't like it.

2140
02:16:00.66 --> 02:16:03.66
And then I found, then I found the ultimate new name for it.

2141
02:16:03.66 --> 02:16:10.66
And there's already another podcast, which I can't even believe exists with this name that I can't believe has already been taken.

2142
02:16:10.66 --> 02:16:13.66
So I'm still in the midst of finding out a new name for that.

2143
02:16:13.66 --> 02:16:14.66
Well, what was the name?

2144
02:16:14.66 --> 02:16:16.66
I'm not going to say it.

2145
02:16:16.66 --> 02:16:17.66
Why not?

2146
02:16:17.66 --> 02:16:20.66
Because it's just, I'm not going to say it.

2147
02:16:20.66 --> 02:16:22.66
We're just so you're still let down.

2148
02:16:22.66 --> 02:16:23.66
I was not saying.

2149
02:16:23.66 --> 02:16:29.66
So we just pointed and also I want to see if there's a way that I can still manipulate the name enough to use it.

2150
02:16:29.66 --> 02:16:30.66
Oh, right, right, right.

2151
02:16:30.66 --> 02:16:31.66
Gotcha.

2152
02:16:31.66 --> 02:16:33.66
But I don't want to give it away.

2153
02:16:33.66 --> 02:16:38.66
Grounded podcast where we talk about you, Jitsu, which we talked about you, Jitsu, Jitsu a lot anyway.

2154
02:16:38.66 --> 02:16:40.66
So, but we talked about it even more.

2155
02:16:40.66 --> 02:16:41.66
And we talk about life.

2156
02:16:41.66 --> 02:16:43.66
And we talk about everything else on the grounded podcast.

2157
02:16:43.66 --> 02:16:45.66
We got the Warrior Kid podcast for your warrior kids.

2158
02:16:45.66 --> 02:16:51.66
We got Warrior Kid soap from IrishOxRent.com, a young warrior kid making soap.

2159
02:16:51.66 --> 02:16:56.66
So everybody out there in the entire world can stay clean.

2160
02:16:56.66 --> 02:17:04.66
We got a YouTube channel, which is where Echo takes videos and he puts them all in there.

2161
02:17:04.66 --> 02:17:06.66
Sometimes he puts modifications.

2162
02:17:06.66 --> 02:17:11.66
I said last time that he should put enhancements into just the podcast.

2163
02:17:11.66 --> 02:17:15.66
So when I talk about counterinsurgency, what I talk about weapons,

2164
02:17:15.66 --> 02:17:18.66
something should happen in this.

2165
02:17:18.66 --> 02:17:22.66
You didn't do it. Whatever total lack of initiative, but it's all good.

2166
02:17:22.66 --> 02:17:25.66
I'm sure there's someone out there that would love to modify these things.

2167
02:17:25.66 --> 02:17:26.66
Yeah.

2168
02:17:26.66 --> 02:17:30.66
To me, the jury is still outweathering out that's a good idea.

2169
02:17:30.66 --> 02:17:32.66
So, you know what I'm going to think about it?

2170
02:17:32.66 --> 02:17:35.66
Why don't we test it? Why don't we see?

2171
02:17:35.66 --> 02:17:39.66
Next time when we do this podcast, you know, you make your little notes.

2172
02:17:39.66 --> 02:17:40.66
You make your little notes.

2173
02:17:40.66 --> 02:17:41.66
Yeah, make your little notes.

2174
02:17:41.66 --> 02:17:45.66
You should be like, oh, when I talk about all there is this massive explosion.

2175
02:17:45.66 --> 02:17:49.66
You could just make a little note that says, like, one hour and 37 minutes.

2176
02:17:49.66 --> 02:17:50.66
Explosions.

2177
02:17:50.66 --> 02:17:52.66
Here's the thing.

2178
02:17:52.66 --> 02:17:55.66
Jock, for somebody that freaking just puts explosions everywhere.

2179
02:17:55.66 --> 02:17:56.66
Yes, sir.

2180
02:17:56.66 --> 02:18:01.66
Yeah, and I'm an explosion advocate, as far as video goes, 100%.

2181
02:18:01.66 --> 02:18:03.66
But here's the thing.

2182
02:18:03.66 --> 02:18:04.66
Here's the thing with that.

2183
02:18:04.66 --> 02:18:08.66
So let's say I put a cool machine gun sound, explosions, whatever.

2184
02:18:08.66 --> 02:18:14.66
Whatever we put in one single person on YouTube with one of those

2185
02:18:14.66 --> 02:18:17.66
ghost accounts that like, you know, no profile picture.

2186
02:18:17.66 --> 02:18:20.66
One of those guys says, that's corny,

2187
02:18:20.66 --> 02:18:25.66
but it's going to like devastate me, I think, us.

2188
02:18:25.66 --> 02:18:26.66
Okay.

2189
02:18:26.66 --> 02:18:27.66
We can do it.

2190
02:18:27.66 --> 02:18:28.66
That's an indicator.

2191
02:18:28.66 --> 02:18:29.66
It's a long day hard enough.

2192
02:18:29.66 --> 02:18:31.66
I'm just talking to tough enough.

2193
02:18:31.66 --> 02:18:35.66
Also, we got psychological warfare, a bunch of me talking about your moments of weakness,

2194
02:18:35.66 --> 02:18:36.66

2195

That's our leadership consultancy.

2206
02:19:07.66 --> 02:19:09.66

02:19:09.66 --> 02:19:11.66

2265
02:21:59.66 --> 02:22:00.66
In your family.

2266
02:22:00.66 --> 02:22:02.66
In yourself.

2267
02:22:02.66 --> 02:22:04.66
And to really easy.

2268
02:22:04.66 --> 02:22:06.66
Just say, hold the line.

2269
02:22:06.66 --> 02:22:07.66
It's really easy.

2270
02:22:07.66 --> 02:22:09.66
I say it all the time.

2271
02:22:09.66 --> 02:22:12.66
But you got to remember all these complexities.

2272
02:22:12.66 --> 02:22:16.66
You got to remember that more than just brute force.

2273
02:22:16.66 --> 02:22:19.66
You have to use your mind.

2274
02:22:19.66 --> 02:22:21.66
You can't just out maneuver.

2275
02:22:21.66 --> 02:22:23.66
You have to outthink.

2276
02:22:23.66 --> 02:22:26.66
You have to give.

2277
02:22:26.66 --> 02:22:27.66
And you have to take.

2278
02:22:27.66 --> 02:22:29.66
You have to think strategic.

2279
02:22:29.66 --> 02:22:31.66
And you have to play the long game.

2280
02:22:31.66 --> 02:22:33.66
And it's not easy.

2281
02:22:33.66 --> 02:22:37.66
But that's how you win.

2282
02:22:37.66 --> 02:22:39.66
So go out there.

2283
02:22:39.66 --> 02:22:41.66
And get after it.

2284
02:22:41.66 --> 02:22:43.66
And until next time.

2285
02:22:43.66 --> 02:22:46.66
This is echo and jacco.

2286
02:22:46.66 --> 02:22:53.66
Out.
