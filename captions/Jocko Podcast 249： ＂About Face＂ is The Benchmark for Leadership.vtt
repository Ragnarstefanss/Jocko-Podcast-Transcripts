00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.40
This is Jockel Podcast number 249 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

2
00:00:06.40 --> 00:00:09.000
Good evening, I go. Good evening.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
One seal, KIA is inbound to Camp Romadi.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
KIA killed an action.

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000
When the call came over the radio from the Army Company commander who was supporting my seals in the field, I felt instantly nauseous.

6
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I wanted to throw up.

7
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But I knew I had to remain calm.

8
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I had to keep my emotions in check as the commander of Seal Team 3 Tasking Abruiser.

9
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I knew the whole tactical operation center and my entire task unit would be watching my reaction to this.

10
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So I took a breath and did my best to seem composed and in control.

11
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Beyond that, I wasn't quite sure how to react or what to say or what to do.

12
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This seal soon reported as Mark Allen Lee, the first seal killed an Iraq.

13
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You shot and killed while assaulting a building in South Central Romadi on August 2, 2006.

14
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Grahiro.

15
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Young and full of love and life and spirit and now in an instant.

16
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Gone.

17
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Seals had been fighting in Iraq for more than three years at this point.

18
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
There had been some casualties but no seals had been killed.

19
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And no seal from Seal Team 3, which was formed in 1983, had ever been killed in action.

20
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:20.000
While other seals from other teams had been lost in Afghanistan, no one above me in the immediate chain of command had ever been in sustained intense combat, much less suffered their men being killed.

21
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Even though we had drilled the tactical mechanics of how to react when a man was lost, we had never trained for how to handle death from a leadership perspective.

22
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
No one had ever even discussed it with me.

23
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
There was no guidance from my senior officers on the matter.

24
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I had to get my guidance from somewhere else.

25
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So I turned to a man who had offered me so much valuable advice about war and about leadership.

26
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I turned to Colonel David Hackworth and his book About Face.

27
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:14.000
In its well-worn pages, I found the council I needed. The fact is, generally, there's no time out for mourning on the battlefield.

28
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But it's really no different than the father of ten who comes home to find his house on fire with all of his kids sleeping inside.

29
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:34.000
He doesn't stop and cry over the first child he finds dead to do so would be to sign a death warrant for the other nine.

30
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
A commanding officer is often in the same situation.

31
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:47.000
To do anything, but continue on would be complete dereliction of duty and in the larger picture could possibly lead to even worse carnage among his troops.

32
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So you do what you have to do and only later when things settle down do you allow yourself to grieve and quote.

33
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Like I had many times before, I followed the guidance of Colonel Hackworth.

34
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
The battle of Ramadi was not going to stop.

35
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
There were still missions that needed to be conducted. Still enemy that needed to be killed.

36
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I told the task unit that we would do the only thing we could do the only thing we should do and the only thing Mark would want us to do.

37
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Put on our gear, lock and load our weapons and go back to work.

38
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Do our duty.

39
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
The men understood this seemingly harsh course of action.

40
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And that was exactly what we did.

41
00:04:45.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Everyone accepted this direction for me, not because of my rank or my position, but because they knew something fundamental about me that despite my hardened demeanor and my measured emotions, they knew I cared about them more than anything else in the world.

42
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:12.000
This feeling came to me instinctively, but it had been reinforced over and over again by what I had read in the pages of about face.

43
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Colonel Hackworth's commitment to his men was one of the primary reasons I related to his book.

44
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
He wrote quote, the thing was, you had to look after your soldiers.

45
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
It was true that a commanding officer's first priority was the mission, but a conflicting requirement was the welfare of the men.

46
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
It was true that the whole purpose of the military establishment was to get a do-foot eyeball to eyeball with the enemy.

47
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And it was equally true that the troops were the ones who paid the price in blood for an objective secured.

48
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
These facts made and make an infantry commanding officer a hanging judge.

49
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
He has incredible power over the lives and deaths not only of a faceless enemy, but of his men.

50
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Sometimes that power causes a leader to become hardened.

51
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
He stopped seeing his troops as human beings.

52
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
They become faceless assets to him.

53
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
He becomes afraid to get close or feel.

54
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Instead constructing a concrete barrier in his head to keep out the guilt and pain of lives lost at his behest.

55
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000
In the process, he forgets that though he may give the orders, it is the soldier who makes them happen.

56
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Or doesn't.

57
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
He forgets that if you want 100% from a trooper, you have to give him 200% as a commander.

58
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
End quote.

59
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
That was hackwords standard.

60
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
You had to give 200% to your men.

61
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
You had to give them everything you had.

62
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I strived for that standard my whole career.

63
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I had spent my entire adult life in the sealed teams.

64
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Like Colonel Hackworth, I'd come up through the ranks,

65
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
spending my first eight years as an enlisted seal before eventually being selected for a commissioning program,

66
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and becoming a seal officer.

67
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
I worked hard.

68
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
But that was in the 1990s.

69
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
There was no war to fight, so we trained and trained and trained even more.

70
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
When we deployed around the globe, we trained other country's troops, but we didn't fight.

71
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
September 11th, 2001 changed all that.

72
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000
The war kicked off in Afghanistan in 2001, and by 2003, the focus had shifted to Iraq.

73
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
My first combat deployment was as a seal, puttune commander in Baghdad,

74
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
from the autumn of 2003 into the spring of 2004.

75
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
My puttune conducted dynamic direct action missions in capture killed scores of enemy personnel.

76
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
We were also ambushed a few times in shot at with RPGs and machine guns.

77
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
We returned fire at suspected enemy positions, or at muzzle flashes we saw in darkened alleyways,

78
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
windows, or doorways.

79
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
During that deployment, only one seal on patrol with me was wounded.

80
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Shot in the head.

81
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Luckily, it was just a ricochet that had enough energy to puncture his skin,

82
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
but not enough to puncture his skull. It left nothing but a minor wound.

83
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
In the end, Baghdad felt more like an exciting adventure for me and my puttune than a war.

84
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
I returned from that deployment feeling as if we had done our share.

85
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I even felt some arrogance starting to creep into my head as if we had tamed a war.

86
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
But that arrogance was kept in check by a reminder that lived in another corner of my mind.

87
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Yes, we had done our job. Yes, we had executed our missions. Yes, we had been to war.

88
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
But it was not the same as the wars I had read about over the years.

89
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Being a seal and a professional military man, I had read many books about war.

90
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Those books reminded me that what we had been through in Baghdad was no Omaha Beach or Guadalcanal.

91
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
It wasn't the chosen reservoir or the Inchon landing.

92
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
It was no eyedring valley or battle of Way City.

93
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Nothing I experienced on my first deployment to Iraq was even close to the level of combat detail in the books I had read.

94
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Of course, technically, what I had been through was classified as war.

95
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:56.000
But for my seal puttune Baghdad in 2003 and 2004 conducting short and simple operations with a huge tactical advantage over a disorganized and untrained enemy, our experience was as forgiving and benign as war could be.

96
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I was lucky.

97
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:08.000
But my next deployment to the capital city of Alambar province, a city known as Rhear Ramadi was different.

98
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
When we arrived in the spring of 2006, it was a complete war zone.

99
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Vehicles mangled by roadside bombs littered the streets. Many buildings were reduced to rubble and almost every building was pocket marked with machine gun bullet holes.

100
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
But the clearest indicator of the level of violence in Ramadi was the casualties.

101
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Every day American soldiers or Marines were wounded or killed.

102
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Every single day.

103
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I had spent almost 16 years training and preparing for this deployment to Ramadi.

104
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000
First, I had completed the basic seal training course known as Buds or basic underwater demolition seal training.

105
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
But that training was simply a weeding out process to get rid of the men who didn't really want to be there.

106
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Almost no tactical lessons are learned there other than to suffer in silence.

107
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:17.000
After Buds, I went through seal tactical training or STT which later became known as SKUT or the seal qualification training.

108
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.000
During that training, I began to learn the individual tactical skills I needed to perform my duties as a seal.

109
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Once I completed that training, I was assigned to a seal platoon where my real learning began.

110
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000
I finally became part of a team where working together was the only way to achieve mission success.

111
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
We learned how to fire maneuver. We learned the fundamental tactics of gun fighting.

112
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
We learned how to conduct ambushes and raids and assaults on buildings and oil platforms and ships at sea.

113
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Surprisingly, unlike in the army or the Marine Corps, where there are written instructions on how to do almost anything.

114
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
In the seal teams, most of what we learned was not taught from a book or a field manual.

115
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:12.000
It was passed down by word of mouth just as it had been for decades, by more experienced platoon members and the seal instructor Cadre.

116
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I was lucky enough to learn from some of the older Vietnam era seals.

117
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:29.000
But by that time, the early 90s, most of the Vietnam veterans were gone and with them almost all the real world combat experience was gone as well.

118
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:39.000
So while the training was good, there were some disconnect between the simulated training combat we conducted and what war was actually like.

119
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:51.000
In the 12 years prior to my deployment to Baghdad, I had done multiple training cycles and deployments and had even served as an instructor Cadre myself teaching the skills I had learned.

120
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
All those years of experience prepared me as well as they could have for my deployment as a platoon commander to Baghdad.

121
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Upon my return to America after that deployment, I did another training cycle to prepare to deploy back to Iraq.

122
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
This time to Ramadi in charge of two seal platoons that made up task unit bruiser.

123
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Surprisingly, during all those years of training, I had received a very little leadership instruction.

124
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
There was no seal doctrine about leadership.

125
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
We attended no classes on the subject.

126
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Nor did we follow any specific leadership protocol.

127
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:39.000
We were simply expected to learn it through OJT on the job training, passed on by word of mouth the same way we acquired our bulk of tactical knowledge.

128
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:48.000
We also learned very little about war beyond straightforward tactical knowledge, how to shoot, move and communicate inside a seal platoon.

129
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Sure, we learned the mechanics of battlefield maneuvers, but we didn't talk about fear and stress.

130
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
We didn't learn about the psychological impact of combat or the emotional shock of the horrors of war.

131
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
No one counseled me on the human capacity for evil or the human capacity for good.

132
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
We talked about human nature, which is revealed in its rost form on the battlefield.

133
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And while I didn't know what I didn't know, I could sense there was a gap between what we learned about tactics and what I truly needed to know in order to effectively lead men into combat.

134
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
I tried to close that gap in knowledge by reading.

135
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
I read everything I could get my hands on about war.

136
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
But I didn't concentrate on the broad strategic and political aspects of war.

137
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Sure, I studied why heads of states made decisions.

138
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
I read about presidents and prime ministers and forestar generals and admirals.

139
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
But I focused most intently on first person accounts.

140
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:03.000
The actual experiences of those frontline men who did the fighting, then the junior and non-commissioned officers who led them.

141
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:12.000
The men storming the beaches, assaulting enemy machine gunnets, and patrolling through jungles, laced with booby traps.

142
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000
What they did, how they did it, what they felt, I read and read and read.

143
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
The authors of these books became my teachers.

144
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:33.000
At some point, and I can't remember exactly when it was, I stumbled upon a book that changed the way I thought about war and leadership and life.

145
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
In fact, it changed the way I thought about everything.

146
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:49.000
That book was about face by David Hackworth, a retired Colonel who had joined the Army just after World War II, was battlefield commissioned to in Korea, serve multiple tours in Vietnam,

147
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
and who became one of the most highly decorated soldiers of all time.

148
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
By the time he retired, he was a master tactician.

149
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:08.000
He understood battlefield terrain. He knew how to maneuver combat elements on the battlefield, but more important than any of those accolades, awards and skills.

150
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Colonel David Hackworth knew people, and he knew how to lead.

151
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:30.000
When I take stock of everything that I've learned in my life about war, about strategy and tactics, about human nature, and about leadership, it is Colonel Hackworth's book that is the clear wellspring for so much of that knowledge.

152
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:50.000
And of all the warriors, heroes, and leaders who I have known and who have mentored me over the years, it is this man, Colonel David Hackworth, a man who I've never met, that provided me with the most guidance and was always there to coach, train, mentor me through the words he wrote in about face.

153
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I read this book at every opportunity during the Battle of Ramadi.

154
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:09.000
In its pages, I found the instruction I needed. It was next to my cot in camp, and if I wasn't in the field, the end of every day was spent learning from this book.

155
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:18.000
I could open the book to any section, read a few pages and relate what I read to what I was living, leadership in the harshest environment.

156
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Without question, my leadership style, my tactical knowledge, the decisions I've made, and my view of the world has been shaped through the lens of this book.

157
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Colonel Hackworth did not only affect my life and career in the military.

158
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
After leaving the Navy, I started a leadership consulting company.

159
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:48.000
I've authored many books of my own, speak regularly about leadership, have a popular leadership podcast, and continue to teach leadership.

160
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Let there be no doubt. Everything I've written and all the leadership lessons I espouse are all rooted in about face.

161
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.000
What makes that fact even more interesting is that about face is not meant to be a leadership book.

162
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:15.000
It was not written for the purpose of teaching leadership. It is an autobiography. It simply tells the story of Colonel Hackworth's life and experiences.

163
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000
But wrapped in that story and those experiences is a complete manifesto on leadership and human nature.

164
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
But even with all those powerful lessons to teach, Colonel Hackworth was not always the easiest mentor to follow.

165
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:39.000
When I first started to speak of him to fellow service members, he was not viewed in a universally positive way.

166
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000
In the Navy, among many senior officers that I encountered, Colonel Hackworth was viewed with a strong sense of disdain.

167
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.000
In 1996, Hackworth wrote an article about then chief of naval operations Admiral Jay Borda,

168
00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
charging the Admiral with wearing a metal on his uniform that he did not rate.

169
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
A Navy combination metal with the combat distinguishing device also known as the combat V.

170
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
The combat V is awarded only when there is direct combat with the enemy.

171
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:20.000
While Admiral Borda did serve honorably aboard a US Navy warship during the Vietnam War, he was never in direct combat.

172
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
When Admiral Borda committed suicide in the aftermath of the investigation,

173
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
some blamed Colonel Hackworth for the Admiral's death.

174
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000
While I understood the grief around the Admiral's death, I also saw Hackworth's perspective.

175
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
For Colonel Hackworth, the combat infantrymen was sacred.

176
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000
He had watched men on the front line serve and sacrificed life and limb in two wars.

177
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000
To Colonel Hackworth, the Admiral wearing an award he did not merit was an affront to every man

178
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
that had ever seen close combat with the enemy.

179
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Hackworth could not and would not let that stand.

180
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
But the fallout from the article, Colonel Hackworth wrote,

181
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:15.000
that they small tribe of senior naval officers with a strong aversion to Hackworth and his perspectives.

182
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Some army leadership also dislike Hackworth and disparage him when I brought up his name.

183
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.000
While they wouldn't quite call him a turncoat, some army soldiers viewed the end of Hackworth's career in the service

184
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
and his subsequent participation in the anti-nuclear movement as slap in the face of the US Army,

185
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
the US military and America.

186
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000
His parting shot wall on active duty was an interview with ABC News correspondent Howard Tucker for the show,

187
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Issues and Answers, in which Colonel Hackworth skewered much of the civilian military leadership,

188
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
their understanding of strategy and tactics, and their gross misconduct of the war.

189
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
He bluntly put the blood of American servicemen on the senior leader's hands,

190
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
quote,

191
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.000
I don't feel that too many division commanders or even separate brigade commanders really understood the name of the game.

192
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
He said,

193
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Did this mean more US casualties?

194
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
This misunderstanding of the name of the game is you put it, Mr. Tucker asked,

195
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Absolutely,

196
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Absolutely, Hackworth responded.

197
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
It is easy for many to see this as in subordination.

198
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
To view Hackworth as a rebellious mutinier trying to denigrate the military system.

199
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
But I saw something different.

200
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
I saw a man who had dedicated his entire life to the service of his country and to his army,

201
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
a man who cared deeply about the men in his charge and every man who wore the cloth of the nation.

202
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
A man who had seen too many of those men fed into the meat grinder that was the war in Vietnam.

203
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And for what?

204
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000
But he failed to see any progress in the Vietnam war and he failed to see any way to achieve victory,

205
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
as long as the military continued with the same ineffective strategies and tactics.

206
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
He could not stand to watch the suffering and needless death anymore.

207
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
It wasn't at all that he hated the army, the military or the country.

208
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
It was that he loved them all too much.

209
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
So he spoke the truth.

210
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
But the sting of this interview and of his attitude after he was shuffled out of the army left the mark.

211
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
A mark of resentment that was passed on to the army and the military and a resentment that was alive and well

212
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
when I discovered Hackworth and about face.

213
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
So it was not always a pleasant task to carry the flag and be a follower of Hackworth.

214
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Fortunately, Hackworth's lessons stand the test of time against any naysayer and this book is absolutely filled with his lessons.

215
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
But the lessons are not only about war.

216
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
While the subtitle of about faces, the Odyssey of an American warrior,

217
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
it could also be aptly subtitled, comprehensive lessons in leadership,

218
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000
battlefield tactics, strategy, command and control, and the essence of human nature.

219
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Well, it might seem impossible that any book could contain so much knowledge about face does just that.

220
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Every page is dense with lessons that provide guidance on leadership, combat, human interaction and just about every other aspect of life.

221
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
And I followed that guidance.

222
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
In fact, I often say that much of what I learned and teach is a leader.

223
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
I stole from Colonel Hackworth.

224
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:57.000
When Hackworth took over Fox company in Korea, he immediately changed its name from Fox company to fighter company.

225
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Quote, Fox company was dead. I told them, from this moment on, we were fighter.

226
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
The troops got a charge out of it and quote.

227
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
He did the same thing as a battalion commander in Vietnam.

228
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
When he took command of the 430 night battalion, it had no unit identity.

229
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000
He promptly changed its name to the hardcore and began to call the troops, Rakondos.

230
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
I followed his example.

231
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
When I became a task unit commander at Seel Team 3 in the spring of 2005,

232
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:43.000
my task unit was assigned the generic title Bravo, a name simply taken from the phonetic alphabet to designate us as the second of three task units at Seel Team 3.

233
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
The other two being Alpha and Charlie.

234
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
In our first meeting as a task unit, I let everyone know that we were no longer task unit Bravo.

235
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
We were task unit bruiser.

236
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:03.000
I saw faces change almost before my eyes as we began to take on the personality of our namesake.

237
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Like Colonel Hacworth had taught me, the troops got a charge out of it.

238
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
I also knew that Colonel Hacworth had a methodology around building relationships.

239
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
He knew that too much familiarity out of the gate with the troops could cause problems in the chain of command.

240
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:27.000
He ensured that the first impression he made with new men was that the mission and the business of soldiering and leading was paramount.

241
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
So he showed no signs of friendliness when he first met his troops.

242
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Quote, for the first month I was with the unit I refused to crack a smile.

243
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Said Hacworth of joining his battalion in Vietnam.

244
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
I did the same thing with task unit bruiser.

245
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
There were no smiles for me when we first formed up.

246
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
The men knew from the beginning that the business of war came first.

247
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:59.000
These were some of the, these were some of the countless leadership techniques I took from Colonel Hacworth.

248
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Hacworth was also a champion of discipline. He kept his uniform squared away and wore a high and tight haircut.

249
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
I always kept my dress uniforms pristine and my hair inspection ready.

250
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Colonel Hacworth was an avid supporter of snipers.

251
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
He invested heavily in them in his battalion in Vietnam and understood their impact.

252
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
I did the same thing in Ramadi utilizing our seal snipers to flip the script and turn my troops into the hunters.

253
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
He said to the hunted.

254
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
I also followed his lead when it came to training troops.

255
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Quote, I wanted each unit trained so well that a PFC could take a platoon and run it.

256
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Roke Colonel Hacworth about training. I strive for the same goal and I often had my junior men run training operations.

257
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:57.000
He also wrote, quote, I'd have one platoon aggress against another and then reverse them until they were masters of both attack and defense procedures.

258
00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000
End quote.

259
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
In the seal teams, we called this force on force training.

260
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
And because of Hacworth, I made that type of training paramount for my troops.

261
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:18.000
In my final years in the seal teams, I codified the essential elements of what I'd learned into what I ended up calling the laws of combat.

262
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Cover and move simple, prioritize, and execute, and decentralized command.

263
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Those four laws became part of the seal leadership doctrine.

264
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000
They also became the basis of the principles I teach to leaders in business and other organizations around the world.

265
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Those principles are all rooted in lessons I learned from about face.

266
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:54.000
The first law of combat is covered and moved. In a gunfight, this means one person or squad or platoon shooting at the enemy to keep the enemies heads down, which is known as suppressive fire, so the other person or squad or platoon can maneuver.

267
00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Hacworth sites this principle again and again with statements like, quote, while the others laid down a good base of fire or tying down the enemy while providing a base of fire.

268
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
And one man providing covering fires, the other edge close enough to flip in a frag.

269
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Statements like that repeated throughout about face made me realize that the number one law of combat was that people have to cover and move for one another.

270
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
To be alone on the battlefield was to die alone.

271
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000
But this law does not only apply to the battlefield, it applies to any team or organization.

272
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Teams have to work together to support one another. Cover and move means teamwork and it is critical for the success of any team.

273
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
The second law of combat is simple.

274
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Plans must be simple and straightforward so that every person on the team understands the plan and knows how to execute it.

275
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Simple plans will also hold up under the chaos and stress of combat. Complex plans will fall apart.

276
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Colonel Hacworth believed in keeping things simple while planning a mission to destroy an enemy supply depot that consisted of caves.

277
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:15.000
The deep behind enemy lines that heavy artillery and air power failed to eliminate. Colonel Hacworth new keeping things simple was a necessity.

278
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:26.000
During an aerial recon, I found the simplest way to make the raid. We'd wait up the center of that creek. It would cover any noise and simplify navigation and quote.

279
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Not only do plans need to be simple, but communication needs to be simple as well.

280
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:43.000
If a leader gives direction in complicated and convoluted language, the direction will not be understood. Simple clear concise language is required so team members understand.

281
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Colonel Hacworth knew this.

282
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:54.000
While preparing to lead an operation in a Vietnam's mountainous Highland terrain, he knew it would be disastrous for his mandatory too much gear and equipment.

283
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
So we let the men know what was most important.

284
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Quote. The single order was a simple one. Lighten up. End quote. Keeping things simple is an age old military maximum that applies to any organization in any arena.

285
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Colonel Hacworth knew this to be the truth. Keep it simple.

286
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:27.000
The third law of combat is prioritizing execute. There will be multiple problems on the battlefield.

287
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:35.000
If a leader tries to solve all those problems at once, his resources will be spread to thin and he will fail at solving any of them.

288
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:44.000
So a leader has to prioritize what the biggest problem is and then execute on solving that problem first before moving on to the next biggest problem.

289
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
One of the most obvious examples of this is tending to wounded men.

290
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:59.000
As Colonel Hacworth advises Quote in a hot firefight, a rifle platoon can take 10 casualties before you can cry medic.

291
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:08.000
And if you multiply by 10, the one rifleman who falls out to look after his buddy suddenly you've lost the guts of the platoon's firepower.

292
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:18.000
A leader cannot give the enemy the initiative by allowing his unit to become ineffective as a result of care for the wounded becoming the first priority.

293
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Any other course carried not only the risk of failure to accomplish the mission, but also the loss of a hell of a lot more men than necessary and to quote.

294
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:38.000
The idea of prioritizing execute does not only apply to the battlefield. It also applies to business and life.

295
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Taking on too many projects or trying to multitask across a wide number of undertaking simultaneously will result in failure.

296
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Leaders cannot allow that to happen instead a leader must do as Colonel Hacworth did prior to his end execute.

297
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
The last law of combat is decentralized command allowing subordinate leaders to lead.

298
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
This is fundamental to the success of any military unit or team.

299
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Subordinate leaders need to understand the mission, the goal, the end state, the parameters they are allowed to work within.

300
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000
What the overall intent of the mission is and most important why they are doing what they are doing.

301
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Then they have to be given the authority and the autonomy to go and execute.

302
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
A failure to work with this mentality is disastrous.

303
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:43.000
As Hacworth explains in about face quote, in this the third year of the war, whether or not to hold a pimple of a hill became an issue for the eight th Army, the Pentagon and sometimes the president.

304
00:32:43.000 --> 00:33:00.000
The only problem was that while those guys hemmed and hauled over weathered with draw, reinforced down at the cutting edge American soldiers died, it would become known as centralization and quote.

305
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:12.000
The mission does not work, not on the battlefield, not in business, not in life, leaders cannot hold the reins of command to tight. Leaders have to let their people lead.

306
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
These were not the only lessons I learned from Colonel Hacworth.

307
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:27.000
He taught me about discipline and fear, building relationships, playing the game, when to break the rules the list goes on and on.

308
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Colonel Hacworth also taught me about things that I shouldn't do from areas where he fell short.

309
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Sometimes he lost his temper or let his ego drive his actions. Sometimes he lashed out at people when he should have kept his mouth shut.

310
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Sometimes he broke rules that he shouldn't have broken.

311
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
His family life while he was on active duty was less than ideal.

312
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:55.000
But even when Colonel Hacworth wasn't right, he was humble and honest about it, which meant I could still learn from him.

313
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Even in his mistakes, he mentored me.

314
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Over time, although I knew he wasn't perfect, I put Colonel Hacworth on a pedestal.

315
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000
But as he taught me, I was always questioning both myself and others.

316
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
I didn't want to fall victim to what he said in about face was among the biggest mistakes of the war, which was that quote.

317
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Politicians only listened to these generals and these generals only listened to themselves and quote.

318
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000
So I always wondered what the people who actually knew and worked with Colonel Hacworth really thought of him.

319
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:41.000
I was lucky to be able to have that question answered when I had the honor of interviewing retired Brigadier General James H.

320
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Mucayama for an episode of my podcast. General Mucayama had an incredible career. One of the highlights of which was serving as a company commander for Colonel Hacworth in Vietnam.

321
00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
This was my chance to find out if Colonel Hacworth deserved the reverence and respect I felt for him.

322
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:09.000
General Mucayama had been a young captain when Colonel Hacworth reported to Fort Lewis Washington as a new battalion commander.

323
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
I asked the general if he knew who Colonel Hacworth was before he met him.

324
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000
General Mucayama replied, quote, of course, we all knew. Hac was a legend.

325
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Everybody knew who he was. He was Mr. Infantry and quote.

326
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000
I asked how everybody knew of Colonel Hacworth. General Mucayama explained, quote,

327
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:43.000
it wasn't only his reputation, it was his appearance, his neck was the size of my waist, his hair was an eighth of an inch, razor sharp sides and all that.

328
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:51.000
It was the way he carried himself. His philosophy was that you were either a dud or a stud and there was nothing in between.

329
00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:00.000
When he came to a unit and found some guys that weren't cutting it, they were gone, especially in combat and quote.

330
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:17.000
General Mucayama also told me that Colonel Hacworth, quote, never did things for personal gain. He always did things for the unit and for the soldiers and quote.

331
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
For the soldiers.

332
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:31.000
It is that underlying theme that permeates about face and is that underlying theme that stuck with me as a leader.

333
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:42.000
But people's strengths are often their weaknesses and perhaps doing things for the soldiers was Colonel Hacworth's undoing.

334
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:52.000
In his interview with issues and answers, when Howard Tucker asked if he had become too emotionally involved in Vietnam, he responded, quote,

335
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
one couldn't see the number of young studs die or be terribly wounded without becoming emotionally involved.

336
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000
I just have seen the American nation spend so much of its wonderful, great young men in this country.

337
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:20.000
I've seen our national wealth being drained away. I see the nation being split apart and almost being split a sunder because of this war and I'm wondering to what end it is all going to lead and quote.

338
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.000
From that emotional feeling about the cost of war came Colonel Hacworth's metaphorical about face.

339
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:36.000
His turn away from the war away from the army and away from America.

340
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
But he could not turn his back forever.

341
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
His heart was too connected, his soul too caring.

342
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
That's why Colonel David Hacworth wrote this book.

343
00:37:49.000 --> 00:38:06.000
And it's why he dedicated it to all the doughboys, the ground pounders, the grunts, the American infantrymen, past, present and especially future.

344
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Well, Hac, if I may be so presumptuous as to call you what your friends called you, your dedication has hit home and your lessons have not been forgotten.

345
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
This book captures the lessons you learned in blood and passes them on.

346
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:38.000
I used them on the battlefield with my seals as we served alongside soldiers and marines in fierce fighting during the battle of Ramadi.

347
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:47.000
I passed them on to the next generation of seals when I ran training for seal platoons and troops deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan.

348
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:57.000
I've talked about them at our service academies and I've shared them with leaders and future leaders at every level and in every branch of the military.

349
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000
You are service to the infantrymen carries on.

350
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.000
But I will also tell you Hac that your impact is not stopped at your cherished infantrymen.

351
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Your leadership philosophies, strategies and tactics can be applied by any leader at any level in any situation.

352
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Just as you found when you applied them to the civilian world yourself and ran highly profitable and successful businesses.

353
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:42.000
I've taught your principles to countless civilian leaders in every industry imaginable and have seen them applied over and over again with extraordinary outcomes.

354
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
So, thank you, Hac.

355
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Thank you for writing this book.

356
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Thank you for being my mentor.

357
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Thank you for your service and sacrifice to our great nation.

358
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:08.000
And even now that you have passed, thank you for taking care of your beloved soldiers.

359
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:15.000
We will follow your lead.

360
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Joko Willink, January 2020.

361
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:39.000
And that is the forward for a new release of the book about face, which is now available.

362
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:48.000
And obviously, no, it's just an absolute honor to be able to write this thing.

363
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:59.000
And it seems I know this word might be a little bit much. It seems a little bit surreal, you know, to have had this book had this huge impact on me.

364
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:12.000
And then to be able to be able to write the forward is just to have my name on this book with, you know, this guy that has had this massive influence on me is crazy.

365
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Yeah, it's a real for me. And I mean, the, yeah, when you like what episode was that when you first covered that book.

366
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:29.000
This is the first book we covered on the podcast episode two episode one of this podcast was, hey, this is what we're doing and answer some questions episode two is about face.

367
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
And I knew that, I mean, when we started episode one, I already knew we were doing it. Why knew what we were doing next.

368
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:45.000
So, and that's kind of what happened. So, what happened was, I first mentioned the book when I was on Tim Ferriss's podcast, which was the first interview I ever did.

369
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:59.000
And no one had any idea who I would, why, why would they know who I was or whatever, but he asked that, yes, you know, he asks asks the same bulk of questions, most of the time.

370
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.000
So, one of the questions that he asks is, what's the book that you've most gifted?

371
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.000
And for me, there's not a, that's a very easy question because, you know, I don't first of all give many gifts.

372
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:22.000
But second of all, I don't have ever given anyone any book ever. And it was this book. I gave actually, I gave a copy to Laf, I gave a copy to Cess Stone.

373
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:32.000
That's who got this book. So, that was pretty easy. And so I kind of mentioned it there, you know, maybe some people got their interest peaked about the book then.

374
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:46.000
But then we started the podcast, this podcast a couple months later. And this was the first book we covered. And then, of course, I refer to it all the time, not only on this podcast, but you know, someone else will ask me that question.

375
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:58.000
So, I said, I'm going to ask a question, what's the, what's the, what's the, what's the, what's the, what's the book, yeah, and so through all this, through all these mentions of the book and talking about the book, it started to sell.

376
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:08.000
So the book, the original book came out in 1989, so it started to sell and it actually started to sell a lot like a lot of copies, which doesn't happen.

377
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:20.000
There's very few books that basically get brought back from the dead, right, when a book's over, it's over and it's outdated and moving on to the next book. So it's very seldom that they have, and there's some name for it. I don't know, in the publishing world.

378
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:33.000
There's a name for, for what happens with a book basically rises from the dead. And so the publishers, you know, having to reprint these books and they're kind, they're stoked obviously, because they're just making money now.

379
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:44.000
And someone in their department, you know, in whatever they have a department, it's like archived books or, so there's some name for these type of old books, if they come back.

380
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:59.000
And so someone started pulling the string and doing the research and trying to figure out where this was all coming from, why are they're selling this book that hasn't sold in, you know, in 30 years or close to 40 years, 35 years, it hasn't, you know, hasn't been a huge seller.

381
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:18.000
It was a New York Times best seller when it came out, but, you know, you get, that doesn't normally happen that they come back. So they pulled the string on it and investigated, and eventually found me and said, hey, you know, we're, we're going to re-assure this book. Would you like to do a blur for the back, meaning a little quote in the back of the book saying, you know, something this is a great book.

382
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:42.000
And me being, give me an instance, I'm going to try and take a mile. I said, never mind a blur by said, I'll write a full forward for this thing. And they were all stoked about it. And so, so here it is. The book is out, the new version of about face by Colonel David Hackworth, forward by Jocca Willing. That's me.

383
00:44:42.000 --> 00:45:02.000
That's crazy. Yeah, that is. You know, like, I'll do this thing where you kind of, kind of go back in time in a way. It's not like remembering a certain time. It's not just remembering, but it's remembering. And then also remembering your mindset and how you were thinking and what you're kind of feeling generally in that time frame, you know, kind of think.

384
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Your values and all this, you kind of put yourself in that exact mindset as you were back then, right? So it's like one of these things where you think back to episode two, one, whenever you'd be for that and how it was such this massive part of your way.

385
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:31.000
And, you know, your favorite book, all this stuff, and then to think back then now, yeah, and a few years, I'm going to be writing the forward to a rerelease of this book right here. It's like that part kind of makes it surreal, even for like me.

386
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:42.000
It's crazy. You know, it was, you know, Jordan Peterson, and I talked to him about this, because he wrote a new forward of the rerelease of the Gullog Arca Palagrow.

387
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:52.000
And the same thing, that was kind of a dead book and all of a sudden, you know, this popular guy comes to start talking about it and then they re-released it and who wrote the forward.

388
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000
And so I talked to Jordan about it, you know, I said, hey, how was that process?

389
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:07.000
But it's probably pretty similar feeling for him, you know, of this book that he really, he got a lot of his thought from this book.

390
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:17.000
And then they re-release it and he wrote the forward. And so when I talked to him about it, I was kind of telling him the same thing about what was going on. So I think we had a similar level of stoke.

391
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
On that. But, you know, we talked about it. We talked about it on episode two.

392
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:30.000
We talked about it with when Jim Muka Yamma, general Muka Yamma was on Mook, cool this guy.

393
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:44.000
When he was on and I read all the sections, you know, that he was kind of involved in and that was awesome. But I wanted to cover some more of the book right now and look, the book is massive, you know, it's 800 and something pages. So

394
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:58.000
To big book. But I wanted to read a little bit more of it, just because look, having read and I just spent whatever 40 minutes reading my words, but my words pale.

395
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000
In comparison to the man himself.

396
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000
So here we go. Let's jump into the book about face.

397
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Six February 1951. When I first saw them about a thousand yards to our front, the enemy looked like little black ants racing from the village towards snow covered hills. It was clear, cloudless morning.

398
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:32.000
The temperature hovered around zero as the tanks kept rolling, closing on the ants and the hills set aside the road dead ahead.

399
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
My squad was piggyback on the lead tank.

400
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Fighting in this frigid temperature is think about it. You're trying to manipulate your weapon. Any time you stop your freezing.

401
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000
I don't know. I like the cold better than the heat. You know what I'm saying?

402
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Yeah. You probably like the heat better than the cold.

403
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000
I don't know. I did under circumstances. Yeah.

404
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:08.000
And I remember at UH we jumped in the ice bath for like 20 minutes. You go your whole body, whatever.

405
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000
When you get out of there, yeah, you can't move. Like you can't move your fingers. Like you can do that.

406
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Yeah. You can do that kind of stuff. So I don't know man. The heat kind of is, I mean, if you have water, but you don't always have water apparently.

407
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
I don't know man. That's pretty pretty shamed up.

408
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000
I don't, yeah. That's a good point. The good point is it's either way it sucks, but certainly the cold is going to suck.

409
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:39.000
I was my back to the book. My squad squad was riding piggyback on the lead tank. It was no long. It was no honor being first in the grim parade.

410
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:52.000
We'd already ravaged the tank's toolbox and knocked off some rations to eat on the way. And now our only comfort was the motor of the M46, which built some welcome heat over our near frozen bodies.

411
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000
There you go. How are you gonna stay warm? Just get by tank exhaust.

412
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000
The tank commander relayed Lieutenant Lance ordered a dismount.

413
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:12.000
I got the guys off like a shot and hit the ground running as the tank rolled on beside us. When I looked beside me, when I looked behind me, I saw the rest of third platoon had not dismounted.

414
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Maybe I'd heard wrong. Maybe I was just over-eager, but it's damn near impossible for infantrymen to re-border moving tank. So there was no choice but to keep running.

415
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000
And hope I hadn't blown it too badly with the re-lutenant.

416
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:38.000
I didn't see the ants again for what seemed like a lifetime, but I sure is how new where they were. And an instant, the familiar roar of the tanks was drowned out by the deafening sound of incoming.

417
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Machine gun mortar artillery and self-propelled anti-tank AT fire.

418
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Like a buzz saw, the deadly crossfire was cutting into my platoon. There was at least a dozen enemy machine guns on the high ground and on both sides of the road.

419
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000
High ground.

420
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:14.000
It's like all these things, all these little things they just, they just seeped into my mind over time. High ground. High ground. This is that word is just in this book. Oh, high ground. High ground. They got the high ground. We got the high ground.

421
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:27.000
My guy is still running alongside our maneuvering tank. We're totally shielded. The other squads on the exposed decks of their tanks were hit hard. By the time we made it to the side of the rice paddy wall and set up a base of fire.

422
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Most of what was left of third platoon was scattered across the frozen ground. The tanks pulled off the road and rolled into position online. Once there they froze.

423
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Earlier in the assembly area, a tank commander had told me as unit the 64th tank battalion hadn't seen much hard combat. I believed him. As soon as they were fired upon, these tankers became paralyzed.

424
00:50:52.000 --> 00:51:01.000
They plumbed for got all their training and just sat there in those great big armored holes while the enemy went on throwing everything out of us, but the mess hall walk.

425
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:10.000
I jumped on the back of the platoon leaders tank and pumped on the hatch with the butt of my rifle. The Lieutenant opened the hatch a crack.

426
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Hey Lieutenant, I yelled. Get some fire going at the enemy. Get the big gun going. Get the machine guns going. What's he asking for? He's asking for a cover fire. Like we're stuck. You got a freaking tank. Open fire.

427
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:39.000
The Lieutenant was not with it. It seemed as though he had no comprehension of the fix we were in. Slugs were splatting hard on the side of the tank. The self propelled AT fire, which was screaming down the valley, dug deep furrows all around us.

428
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:55.000
And yet the tanks still sat there silently like big fat clay ducks at a shooting gallery. Sergeant, the Lieutenant finally said in a shell shocked kind of days. Look, look, you see out there on the ice?

429
00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:06.000
Yes, I saw it. It was a pile cap, a little fur ball on the ice and made my platoons dead and wounded the bullets and the blood. That's my cap he said. Would you get it for me?

430
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:16.000
So, you know, what are you learning from that right there? You are learning that people are not going to be able to handle certain situations and they might be focused on something that they shouldn't be focused on.

431
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:30.000
I mean, and this is an extreme example, but if you've never been to combat before and you're in a leadership position, you might need to learn a lesson from that that you might get guys that aren't going to act the way you would expect them to act.

432
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:42.000
What does he do? Back to the book. I considered shooting the sorry son of a bitch then and there climbing inside his tank and taking command. Fortunately, reason prevailed.

433
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:56.000
I grabbed him and shook him until he looked as he views back to the real world. Then I instructed him to have three tanks concentrate on the self-propelled AT fire to our front and use the others to start placing man gun fire on the hills.

434
00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:06.000
To give him a bit of encouragement, I manned the tanks 50 caliber turgun and blasted one of the hills myself until I'd used up all the ammo and the commander got his men in action.

435
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.000
What does that tell you? What do you do when people want to do? That's a lead from the front scenario.

436
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:23.000
You know, in leadership strategy and tactics, I went through this whole the book, the book leadership strategy and tactics. I went through this whole section talking about leading from the rear.

437
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:32.000
And how, you know, you want to let your leaders lead, you want to let your subordinates lead, you want to let them step up. If you're always leading from the front there, they're always following and you don't want that.

438
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:40.000
But I also make a case for, hey, there are absolutely times when you've got to lead from the front. This is one of those times.

439
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Once the back of the book, once the 90 millimeter guns got going, we were on our way to gaining fire superiority.

440
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:56.000
The amount of incoming decreased as the tanker started to remember why they were there, but the tank commander stayed buttoned up inside their turrets.

441
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:03.000
No one was using the 50 calibers. So to explain this little bit, you know, a tank has like the big gun that you think of a tank.

442
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:09.000
But then on top of it, they have a machine gun, a 50 caliber machine gun, which is a big giant machine gun.

443
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:17.000
And basically, you sit up out of the turret of the tank, so you're exposed, but then you can shoot that 50 cowl wherever you want to shoot it.

444
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:25.000
And all these guys were buttoned up inside their tanks, not using that weapon. Now they also have a weapon usually that's called a machine gun.

445
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:33.000
That's coordinated, it's called a collaxial gun. So it's a machine gun. So you got the big main gun, which, you know, is what you think of when you see a tank.

446
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:41.000
But next to that is a collaxial machine gun that they can fire from inside the tank. And it's just a machine gun that's pointing in the same direction as that big gun.

447
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:49.000
But then in addition to that, they have this 50 caliber turret mounted gun that you can get up out of the weapon, out of the tank and you can shoot from.

448
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000
Is that a common thing? The 50 cowl? Yes.

449
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:59.000
It's weird, I don't know if I didn't notice it or what? Not that I'm sitting around looking at tanks all the time.

450
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Yeah, thanks all the time. Yeah, nothing but. Yep. Three guns on a tank essentially. Yeah, I see main gun, Mike, my main gun, Mike, byma.

451
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.000
He's a, he's a tank fanatic.

452
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:23.000
But, but, you know, he used all those weapons. The collaxial machine gun is main gun and his turret mounted 50 cowl get some.

453
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:31.000
So what is the two, two, two, three guys in the tank or what? I don't know. I don't forget how many people in the tank. There's a driver, there's a gunner.

454
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:38.000
I want to say there's three or four people in there. Oh, interesting. Yeah, it's tight corners. It's hot.

455
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000
God bless him.

456
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:50.000
So back to the book. Once the 90 millimeter guns got going, we were on our way to gaining fire superiority.

457
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:58.000
The amount of incoming decreased as this tanker starting to remember why they were there. But the tank commander stayed buttoned up inside their turrets.

458
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000
No one was using their 50 cowlbers. I just couldn't believe it.

459
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Eight inches of steel between them and the chaos outside yet they didn't have it in them to help the sun come out for the guys stopping slugs with their field jackets.

460
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:21.000
I went from tank to tank pounding on the hatches and blasting away on each of their 50s until all the ammo was exhausted.

461
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:29.000
This little exercise had its effect. The tank commanders got the word and started doing what they should have been doing all along.

462
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:40.000
When no further spoon feeding was required, I returned to my platoon. So again, that's just taking action, letting people see you have to lead from the front sometimes. Lesson learned.

463
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000
There were dead and wounded everywhere.

464
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Slugs were ricocheting off the ice. We get see sparks where they hit. Jim Parker's second platoon had successfully silenced an enemy machine gun to our left. So the pressure was off us.

465
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:06.000
So the pressure was off enough for us to get our wounded behind the protection of the tanks and patty walls where they could be patched up.

466
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Our progress was hampered, though, because the tank crews kept moving their tanks. They didn't stop to think they were exposing our wounded all over again. They were too busy trying to save their own armor-coded skins.

467
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:30.000
I told the tank lieutenant who might come to view and treat accordingly as a recruit at Fort Knox. That the next time a tank moved exposed our guys, I'd fire a 3.5 bazooka right up his ass.

468
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:48.000
There was no more movement. I saw a soldier prone on the ice. He'd been there a long time. I thought he was dead, but then I saw movement and rushed out to get him. My God, I thought, it's debouer.

469
00:57:48.000 --> 00:58:11.000
I've had been with George company since early in the war. He was one of the few survivors from the original third platoon, basically because in those first hard months of combat, he had not seen one good firefight. He had an uncanny sixth sense. He could always tell when the platoon was in for a major bloodletting.

470
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:25.000
He'd find an excuse to be somewhere else. Normally that excuse was going on sick call, which by regulation he was allowed to do, and he couldn't stop him even though you knew the only thing that was wrong with him was a chronic case of cowardice.

471
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:32.000
Debuer himself even admitted he was a coward. And we hated him for it.

472
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:48.000
He was now cast from the platoon, and we even had a little song about him, which we'd all sing in unison, quote, out of the dark, jury-curean countryside comes the call of the Debuer bird, sick call, sick call, sick call, and quote.

473
00:58:48.000 --> 00:59:17.000
He'd pulled this stunt only yesterday as we were saddling up for this very operation. He'd sensed the bloodletting all right, but hadn't figured that Debuer, foggy overcast, covering the battlefield would not lift, then the attack would be postponed. He'd return from the dock last night with a clean bill of health most surprised to see us. The rest of the platoon took great pleasure in the fact that his malingering little ass would be in the thick of things in the morning.

474
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Now Debuer was ash and faced hit in the chest or gut, I didn't know there was a lot of blood and well into shock.

475
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:39.000
I knew he wasn't going to make it. Come on Debuer, you're going to be fine, you'll be all right, I said, giving him the old pep talk.

476
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:50.000
As I grabbed his jacket collar and started sliding him across the ice, but Debuer said, no, Sarge, just leave me, you're going to get hit.

477
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Just leave me, Sarge, then suddenly he groaned, Sarge, I just shit my pants.

478
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:08.000
And that was it, he was gone. I left him and ran back.

479
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Debuer in death became one of the great heroes of our outfit.

480
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:22.000
It was true he'd never been anything in his army life, but a coward, but he died right, he died like a man.

481
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:29.000
He didn't say take care of me, he said, leave me, take care of yourself.

482
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000
And when I told the other guys the story, old Debuer became a legend in the platoon.

483
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:51.000
You know, whenever I read things like this, you know, or not whenever, but sometimes I just kind of get curious.

484
01:00:51.000 --> 01:01:11.000
So you get Google, the internet, interwebs, and you know, you do do Google, Henry C. Debuer, and there it is, Korean War, six February, 1951 from Newport, News, Virginia, son of Margaret Debuer.

485
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Didn't find much else besides that, but story behind every one of those names.

486
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Back to the book, the road ran north south, and we were on the east side of it. The balance of G company was on attack, maneuvering to secure the high ground to the north and to the west. There it is again, high ground.

487
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Do you think that my word where we read four pages more talking about high ground, do you think that might be an important thing in the world?

488
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:51.000
My platoon, or what was left of it, was the fixum element trying to tie down the enemy while providing a base of fire for parkers and Gilcrest pltunes.

489
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
What does that mean? It means cover move. It means he's in the cover position. The other elements are moving.

490
01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Maybe that's important. Do you think it is? You've never been in combat before, and you hear this guy keep saying, put down cover fire? Yes.

491
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:14.000
After we got organized, I had a moment to look around. I saw my platoon late leader, Lieutenant Land, sort of crouch down, leaning against a rice paddy wall observing the whole action.

492
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:23.000
John Land was a good man, a World War two vet and former G company NCO. He was one of the few battlefield commissions in the 27th.

493
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Isn't he a cool customer? I fought to myself now, just watching this whole thing and taking it all in.

494
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Because really, that was about the only thing you could do in a time like this.

495
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Stay cool, stay down, and establish fire superiority as best you could. Do you think that's an important lesson?

496
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
To stay cool, stay calm, stay down, get fire superiority.

497
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I examine what we have left in terms of a fighting force. Tennessee, Mitchell, Robert, Delbert, Bell, and Old DeBur.

498
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.000
There were seven dead altogether and about a dozen wounded. The platoon sergeant was gone and the assistant platoon sergeant was nowhere inside.

499
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000
It seemed that all was left of third platoon was the balance of my squad, bits and pieces of the other two, and a light machine gun team.

500
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I ran over to the little lieutenant to ask for instructions.

501
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000
When I got there, I realized the reason Lieutenant Land was so cool was that he was also dead.

502
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:28.000
He'd called a slug right between the eyes. The blood had poured down his face and chest, filled up the eyepieces of his binoculars and frozen there.

503
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:36.000
I took the binoculars and slipped the radio from his dead radio operators back. I called Captain Mikeley.

504
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Our company commander gave him the situation report.

505
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:48.000
He said, I was now in charge that we were to continue tying down the enemy and get the wounded out in that order of priority.

506
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Hmm, is that interesting?

507
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:59.000
You've got the leader giving you two things to do and telling you that one of them is the priority.

508
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Lieutenant Gilchrest, first platoon who's having a hell of a time,

509
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:12.000
their attack was being held up by fire from a hornets nest of well-concealed enemy automatic weapons position.

510
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Just as we've gotten the wounded under control, one of our guys who'd been doing some scouting spotted North Korean fighting positions on the other side of the deck,

511
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
First platoon was attacking. He motion me over to have a look.

512
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Sure enough, at least a platoon was dug in there, almost in the shadow of the tanks.

513
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
They were so close to the tanks, main guns couldn't depress low enough to hit them.

514
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
North could their anti-tank weapons hit our tanks.

515
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
It was a Mexican standoff, but not for long.

516
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
So you have tanks, they can only lower their weapons so much.

517
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
And so you've got the enemy so close and in a depressed position that you can't even shoot them.

518
01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:03.000
So you've got a little Mexican standoff and then all right, who's going with me, I asked.

519
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.000
So what is what is hack worth do? He gets default aggressive. He's going to take action.

520
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
He's going to take action.

521
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:23.000
So he says, all right, who's going with me, I will said van meter, our platoon medic, a stud of a guy who had a great reputation as a fighter, as he did as a doc.

522
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
While the others laid down a good base of fire, the doc and I threw two frag grenades over the deck.

523
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Hmm, what is that? That's cover move. You laid down fire. I'm going to hug grenades.

524
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Hmm. When they exploded, we leaped through the smoke landing front and center of the enemy. It was eyeballed the eyeball, the two of us facing at least 30 days, the wounded or dead communists.

525
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:57.000
The enemy appeared to be leaderless. They were certainly in a state of shock and we cleaned them up and we cleaned up the position with ease using rifles and bayonets.

526
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:16.000
You don't think too much about bayonet fighting in the Korean War, but, apparently you're getting after it, the two more than two more enemy soldiers appeared out of the smoke and confusing dragging a 57 caliber anti tank buffalo gun.

527
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:27.000
We were no more than 10 feet apart. I leveled my M1 was about to shoot them when I looked down and saw that the bolt was back. My weapon was empty and it wasn't exactly the time for reloading.

528
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
I lunged forward with the bayonet at on guard shouting, taosong.

529
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:42.000
The enemy threw up their hands. The Chinese word for surrender was probably the only one I knew. I'd filed it away in my brain when we were up north.

530
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I must admit I learned it. I must admit I learned it thinking that someone would be saying it to me.

531
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000
But it didn't matter now. They're they stood with burp guns still hanging around their necks. A buffalo gun at their feet and me with an empty rifle.

532
01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:03.000
The funny thing was that these guys were Korean, not Chinese and the chances that they had understood what I had said.

533
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:15.000
And the chances and the chances were they hadn't understood what I had said anyway. On the other hand in combination with that long razor sharp bayonet pointing at them, they probably would have surrendered if I had given the order in Swahili.

534
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000
In any event we took their weapons and turned the POWs over to our men on the other side of the deck.

535
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Then the dock and I continued mopping up in numbers and in firepower. These guys certainly should have outgunned what was left of third platoon.

536
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:39.000
From the number of bodies buffalo guns and other AT weapons we found we conclude that we'd knocked off an anti-tank platoon that had been as green as scared as our tankers.

537
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.000
The only difference was of course that these North Koreans would never tell the story of their baptism of fire.

538
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:57.000
By the time we rejoined the platoon, my guys had looted to the two prisoners. The only real treasure was a US made Walfum Pocket Watch, which the guys gave to me.

539
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:07.000
They became my six February souvenir. None of us spoke Koreans, so I asked PFC Charles to take the POWs back to Captain Mike Lee for interrogation.

540
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I was really pleased we'd nailed them.

541
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Prisoners are the best source of battlefield information.

542
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Pretty pertinent fact.

543
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:30.000
And we're fighting still going on full tilt all around us. It'd be useful to find out what the hell was happening in the enemy camp.

544
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000
The first and second platoons of George were fighting hard to take the high ground.

545
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Navy courseers were working with the enemy over working the enemy over with Napalman strafing runs cut off between mine and Gilcrest platoon were an enemy who'd been bypassed.

546
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:54.000
So I took a half a dozen of our guys and went up the hill to do some hunting. Once again taking action, taking the high ground.

547
01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
The North Koreans were cleverly concealed, well dug, bunkers stuffed with straw for warmth.

548
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:08.000
The pine covered hill was a maze of seemingly unrelated positions which we slowly worked through in two man teams.

549
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Fire in the hole was shouted again and again as we grenade bunker after bunker.

550
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:18.000
One man providing cover fire as the other edge to close enough to flip in a frag.

551
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Loss of combat.

552
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.000
The enemy did not fight back. They stayed in the bottom of their holes looking like trap moles.

553
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
It didn't take long before we ran out of frag grenades.

554
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
A field expedient was quickly devised.

555
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.000
The strafing stripped our tracer slugs from the machine gun belt and clipped them for our M1s.

556
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:50.000
With one man covering his partner with slip up to the hole and snap off a tracer to into the position. The red hot slugs would ignite the straw inside.

557
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
And when the defender came up coughing, he'd be shot between the horns.

558
01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Gary Cooper wiped out a dozen dozens of German soldiers in Sergeant York by lowering them out with a turkey call.

559
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:09.000
There was good enough for Sergeant York and Hollywood. It was good enough for us on 6 February 1951.

560
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.000
We moved from hold the hole systematically burning the enemy out until the hilltop above us suddenly exploded with gunfire.

561
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
The reds were counter attacking.

562
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
As Gilcrest puttune fought them off only six feet from the crest of the hill.

563
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
We beat feet back to the safety of our rice paddy wall.

564
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Patty walls whose purpose in more peaceful times was irrigation control where dirt walls about a foot thick and about three feet high.

565
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Perfect cover for most direct fire weapons infantry men loved them.

566
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Now, leaning against my safe Patty wall, even as first puttune fought off another counter attack with the help of second, which could observe the forward slope of Gilcrest's hill and provide warning of the enemy's intention. I realized I was starving.

567
01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I opened a can of sea rations with my trusty p38 and Doug right in. I started at the top of the can.

568
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Big chunks of congealed fat under which lay beef and potatoes frozen rock hard.

569
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.000
About this time an enemy sniper started firing along the top of the rice paddy wall.

570
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:24.000
It was harassing fire only no one got hurt, but it got on all of our nerves far more even than the largest battle still going on around us.

571
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000
I just got down to the meat and was about to take my first bite when zip.

572
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.000
A slug creased the furrow in the top of the wall right above my head and shoured my rations with debris.

573
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I scooped it out. I was about to try another bite when zip another slug. Same place did the same thing. By the third time that was it, I was pissed off. I'm going to get that sniper who's with me.

574
01:11:48.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Ray Wells, an ace machine gunner and good old country boy from West Virginia volunteered. We followed the Patty wall to a drainage ditch that took us behind the North Korean anti tank positions, but plan was simple.

575
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:11.000
To get right to the rear of the sniper shoot the son of a bitch and go back and finish my seas. The ditch had an L-shaped turn. We stopped just shy of it.

576
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Where I inched forward to have a quick peek. Three Koreans manning a machine gun were lying in the prone position about 10 feet away not looking our direction.

577
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I slipped back to Wells whispering that I take the first guy he take the third and we double up on the gunner in the middle.

578
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:44.000
We stepped out of the ditch, the North Koreans looked up but Wells and I were the last thing they ever saw. I knew they were dead. They were so close that I could hear the slugs thumping home in their padded jackets. We jumped over them and continued on our way.

579
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I came up behind a little tree at the top of the ditch. I deal concealment for a quick look see. After a few seconds scan I spotted the sniper on the hill.

580
01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:05.000
He was in a bunker about a hundred yards away on my left and I could clearly see the side of his head and his soviet SKS rifle. I ducked down.

581
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I didn't want to take a chance on Kentucky Windage, so I adjusted my M1 rifle sights down four clicks and got into a firing position. I had the sniper's head sitting right at the top of my front sight, but just as I was about to squeeze the trigger, I heard machine gun slugs snapping over my head. Then the repins report. The weapons report. Oh shit, I thought someone seen me for all I knew it could have been one of our tankers. The slugs were coming from that direction. Maybe they hadn't gotten the word that we were out here.

582
01:13:35.000 --> 01:14:02.000
So I started to go down, but as I went down I felt the top of my head explode. I'd called a slug. So what do we have here? Well we have a potential blue on blue scenario. I guess we don't know where that rounds coming from but it's coming from the general position of his tanks. So how's that happening? Well, that people don't know where he is. How important is to know where each other on the battlefield that's the most important piece of information you have?

583
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:11.000
What's a sea ration? I mean, I know it's food. You know what an MRE is, right? Yeah. So that's the old school MRE.

584
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:24.000
But they came in cans, not in the plastic pouches that modern MRE comes in. So they say it's like sea, is it the letter C ration or it's S-E-A ration? They write with a C.

585
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:43.000
S, just the legislatures are just the, but I don't know where the origination of maybe it's canned rations that might be it. I don't think it's like these are meant for navel vessels at the sea because they, because they wouldn't use them out there because on ships they have big refrigerators and kitchens instead.

586
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I'm sure we'll find out when this comes out. People will let us know. Yeah. I'm guessing canned. That makes sense. Yeah, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the truth.

587
01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Like most good wolf-ounds, I wasn't wearing a helmet helmet to wear a pain in the ass unless there was a lot of artillery and mortifier coming in in which case they became as essential as air. The slug ripped through my fur pile cap and propelled me from the top of the ditch as though I'd been po-l-axed by Paul Bunyan.

588
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:29.000
I don't know if I lost consciousness or not, but I do know I was stunned with four-larm sirens ringing in my ears. Well, I thought I was dead and took off down the ditch. I couldn't blame him.

589
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:44.000
He thought he was all alone in behind enemy lines meanwhile I tried to focus on what had happened. So that sucks. But that time you get shot and you come to, you see your buddy leaving you for dead and you can't even blame him because you just got shot in the head.

590
01:15:44.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Blood really thick was pumping out of my head. The first thing I did was ask myself my name, rank and serial number, David Hacquorth, David Haskell Hacquorth, Sergeant, R.A. 19242907. That's pretty funny. He's been in the military so like institutionalized that when the first thing he asked is, they rank and serial number of himself. That's just beautiful.

591
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:23.000
That came the automatic response which made me decide that my head must still be okay even if my ass was the worst crack ever.

592
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I started crawling down the ditch. I had to crawl because the North Koreans on the high ground knew they had an intruder in their midst.

593
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:42.000
I stayed low on the enemy side. Slugs were spraying the ditch fast and furious but thumping up against the other wall. I crawled until I reached the machine gun crew.

594
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Wells and I had knocked off. Now I was faced with a dilemma. If I jumped over them, I'd become exposed to the enemy fire coming from the hill.

595
01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:03.000
If I crawled over them, one of them might still be alive and the longer I looked, the more my confused head convinced me to see that one of them was alive.

596
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:10.000
And he'd kill me. I couldn't shoot them because when I got hit, I dropped my rifle.

597
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:17.000
So I just stared at them. Like a dumb recruit wondering what to do. I pulled my trench knife out of my boot.

598
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Very carefully, I crawled over one of them waiting for him to move. I crawled over the next one waiting for him to move.

599
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Then I crawled over the third guy the same way and slipped on like a snake down the ditch until it was high enough for me to crouch.

600
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Then high enough for me to stand up and run. The whole time I was singing.

601
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Whoever said there aren't any atheists on the battlefield was dead right.

602
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Often when we'd be sitting around our little fires, one of the guys in the Paltoon would play as guitar and we would sing.

603
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:55.000
The songs were all religious ones, like down by the river side, where we'd be laying down our swords and shields.

604
01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Or please dear Jesus, hear my plea, just a little closer walk with thee.

605
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:09.000
But there are also songs of great comradeship and a most magic feeling would always pour out when we sang.

606
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:16.000
A feeling that third Paltoon, our Paltoon, was our family, our whole life.

607
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:24.000
And somehow, between God and our brothers, we were going to make it through.

608
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:33.000
So as I pounded down this ditch, I was singing just a closer walk with thee with deep feeling.

609
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Ella Fitzgerald, look out.

610
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:42.000
To my mind, I was really talking to God. I was talking to the man.

611
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:49.000
So I'm singing and running, blood's pouring out of my head, and then I remember I didn't have my rifle.

612
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:56.000
What a rotten example I had set. Good NCOs don't screw up like that.

613
01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Only a dumb shit of a soldier loses his rifle.

614
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:07.000
So I stopped singing and started chewing my asses I ran down that ditch.

615
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Maybe it was because I was thinking about my lack of professionalism.

616
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Maybe it was just second nature thing from my training.

617
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Or maybe it was a sixth sense. I don't know.

618
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.000
But the second's before I was home free just a few feet more.

619
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I told myself just around the corner I stopped.

620
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Hey, third Paltoon, it's Hackworth. I shouted. I'm coming in.

621
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Then I turned the corner.

622
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:46.000
I found myself looking down the throat of corporal Wesley Morgan's mean looking browning automatic rifle.

623
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Man, you were so loud coming down that ditch.

624
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I found at least a Paltoon of Gooks was on the march.

625
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Well, it's told me you got it.

626
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:03.000
If you hadn't called out, I would have moved you down.

627
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:13.000
So we have another potential blue on the blue scenario there.

628
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:20.000
And you know, I'm calling out all these little examples in this book.

629
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:28.000
And this book is just, it just filled with them.

630
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000
It's filled with them over and over again.

631
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:37.000
And we'll get into more of it.

632
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000
This is a long book. I could talk about this book forever.

633
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000
I think straight as I've read it so many times and every time I read it,

634
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I find something new, something different.

635
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Here's my original copy.

636
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
This is the first copy I ever got right here.

637
01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
This old one. It's all beat up.

638
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I sent Tim Ferriss a copy.

639
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.000
And he sent me a note back and he said, I said, hey, here's about face.

640
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
This is the book I mentioned.

641
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000
And I sent him like an old hardcover because I have a bunch of copies.

642
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.000
And he like felt bad because it was an older looking book.

643
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
He's like, wait a second.

644
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Is this like, because we had talked about it even off the podcast.

645
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
He was waiting a second.

646
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Is this like the book that you had in Iraq?

647
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
I go, no, no, no, no, no.

648
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
It's just a copy.

649
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000
But it's an older copy.

650
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Yeah, there's just so many lessons.

651
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:35.000
And like I said, the book is 830 pages long with small writing.

652
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000
And also what's cool about it is you can open it up.

653
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.000
You don't have to read the whole thing.

654
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000
You can open up anywhere.

655
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
You can start reading.

656
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
If you know the general story, you can start reading it anywhere.

657
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
And that's that makes it beneficial.

658
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
And actually, life was telling me the other day.

659
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
And I remember doing this once.

660
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Life was telling me.

661
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
He would like, you know, we'd be talking about something.

662
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
I have it down in the tax for operations.

663
01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Like sitting on my deck desk.

664
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
And, you know, there'd be some.

665
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000
And, you know, there'd be some.

666
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Something in there.

667
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000
I'd read it to him.

668
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
You know, be like, hey, listen to this.

669
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
You know, him and his assistant, two in commander, whatever I'd read it to him.

670
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000
And, you know, say, what does that remind you of?

671
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And it'd be some situation, the exact situation that we were going through.

672
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:24.000
You know, and so yeah, I even lay for members how much I relied on this book.

673
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:30.000
But, you know, the other thing about this book.

674
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I think is that this book started to get me to see the way in all things.

675
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:44.000
You know, as the first book I started, I bet you could do a good video.

676
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Oh, like layering things.

677
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Like all the little examples I pointed out.

678
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Can you imagine those words like high ground starting to really like come, like seeing it and seeing like,

679
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000
oh, that's cover, that's important.

680
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
High ground, that's important.

681
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
You know, people doing things, leading from the front.

682
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:15.000
All those things started to just sort of appear as their level of importance and the connectivity to what I was going through and what I would see.

683
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.000
So it's like this book, even though I had already been to college.

684
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.000
And I have to give credit to when I was, when I was, when I studied Shakespeare in college.

685
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
You know, I was an English major.

686
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
So I had to study Shakespeare.

687
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:39.000
And when we covered Henry the fifth on podcast, 15, I was talking about the fact that you don't, you, you have to really read Shakespeare.

688
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000
You have to look up the words you don't know. You have to decipher it.

689
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:49.000
And so that was one level of my ability to comprehend what I was reading.

690
01:23:49.000 --> 01:24:07.000
But this was like the next level of of realizing that what you're reading can be overlaid and it can be that you can, it can add context and it can be instituted into your own context of your own experience.

691
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Yeah, like kind of like the Bible almost.

692
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Yeah.

693
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:16.000
You know, like let the, you'll tell a story and then the, like the story, the significance of stories like the lesson.

694
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Right. And then it's so yeah, if you approach the book that it is this, it is, I'm reading this book for the lesson like as it applies to me today, you know, so you can kind of look to it.

695
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Okay.

696
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Yeah.

697
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Other, I think the book, I mean, we've covered the first, the podcast, the books that we covered on this podcast, a lot of those books I read before we started the podcast.

698
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:43.000
But like when I would read those books, I would basically be reading a quote, cool or story.

699
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Right. This was the first book where I started going way to second.

700
01:24:48.000 --> 01:25:03.000
I see the connection. I see the connection, not just like all of a sudden I started drawing those same connections in all these other books that I would read, but it started with this one, which is, and I don't know why.

701
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Maybe it's because it's long and maybe it's because it repeats those same lessons over and over again.

702
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:25.000
But yeah, I got to, it's really the first time I got to utilize someone else's knowledge in a way to help me, not just to help my knowledge, but really to add to my own experience.

703
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:34.000
And this book, this book did it for me. So we'll cover more of it.

704
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
We'll cover more in the future.

705
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:45.000
But is that out? This is out. This is available. We have it on the website as you know.

706
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Yeah, hey, there are there are two versions. So there's the old version and you actually have to go specifically and we'll put the link.

707
01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:03.000
You have to go specifically to the new version of it to get the one that has that forward that I read.

708
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Yeah, if you want to check out this book and yeah, that's the thing. Don't be intimidated because it's 834 pages because you can read it three pages at a time.

709
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:18.000
That's the other thing that's cool. It's not like a book where you've got to read 20 pages to be like, get something out of it. You can read four pages of this.

710
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Then you'll get something out of it.

711
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Yeah, yeah, and yeah, some books are cool like that.

712
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:30.000
And you can kind of, especially if you just know the general story where you open up wherever and you're like, okay, and you can get the, you know, like some of them,

713
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:38.000
you're like, all shoot, I shouldn't read this part because not only will it might, it might not make sense, but you know, you kind of should read the beginning first.

714
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
You know, otherwise it would be spoilers or whatever.

715
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.000
And you know what else we'll go into at some point.

716
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
You know, I always on this podcast a few times that I read from this book.

717
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:52.000
I'm only I only talk about the war part, but there's massive sections of his career between the Korean war and the Vietnam war,

718
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.000
where he was, he was a soldier in a peacetime environment.

719
01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.000
So what he was doing was he was doing maneuvering and he was building relationships.

720
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:11.000
He was doing all these things, all these leadership things that you have to do as a leader in order to build relationships and make good decisions and knowing a bit like all that stuff.

721
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:21.000
So it's not, it's not all war even though a lot of it is, but he covers all these different dynamics of human relationships and human nature.

722
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:33.000
And it's just, it's just good. So I, like I said, I'm honored, I got to write the fork. I'm honored. I've been able to share this book with a bunch of people.

723
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000
So hack.

724
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Thank you.

725
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Thank you for the knowledge and passing it on.

726
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.000
And with that echo speaking of knowledge.

727
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Yes.

728
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Do you have any knowledge you want to share with us?

729
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Sir.

730
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Well, we are on the path. This is how to stay on the path.

731
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Let's hold deal. Okay. We'll discuss it. How about that?

732
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
So we're working out.

733
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000
We are.

734
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Are you injured right now?

735
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
No.

736
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:09.000
I got some, I got some small cuts, but I don't really consider those injuries.

737
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Small scrapes caught to what not from branches.

738
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
No, Larry.

739
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.000
There's been some waves here in Southern California.

740
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Basically, to your reference there, I was, as we know, hunting in the wilderness and the wild.

741
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000
And while I was hunting, I actually didn't receive any.

742
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
No, no cuts, no scrapes.

743
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:37.000
There's always that possibility, especially, you know, when it's dark and you can fall.

744
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Sure.

745
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
But, no.

746
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000
And you don't wear nods. Night vision goggles, obviously.

747
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
No, I just have a question.

748
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Yeah.

749
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000
You're right. That's about a tip of the world. So it's a little easier for all once it gets dark.

750
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Where were you?

751
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
I was in Utah.

752
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Hmm.

753
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
So what, what do we, what, it's cold there.

754
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
It's cold or warm.

755
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Right.

756
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
What is the temperature was absolutely warm.

757
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
It was warm. It was a little too warm.

758
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000
It was a, it was comfortable.

759
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
I was going to say absolutely comfortable.

760
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.000
But the problem is it's too warm.

761
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
It needs to be colder for the type of hunt that I was doing.

762
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Oh, because it was like art.

763
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Like you guys are traveling, right?

764
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
No, it's just the animals elk.

765
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Yeah.

766
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000
They like it to be colder and they're more active when it's colder.

767
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000
So when it's hot, they kind of sleep and it's harder to find them.

768
01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:27.000
And you're trekking through the mountains on a certain course or is it like the kind.

769
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
You're just looking for elk.

770
01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
You're looking for elk.

771
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
And what?

772
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Have you ever seen an elk bugle before?

773
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:40.000
So elk do something called bugling, which is a completely animalistic.

774
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Dinosaur, craziest, screeching, howling noise.

775
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Yes, and they go nuts doing it.

776
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.000
And so you hear that and then you try and go to it.

777
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Except for the crazy thing is they're so fast.

778
01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:01.000
They're just the way they move through the wilderness.

779
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
You know when you run hills?

780
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Sure.

781
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Oh, yeah.

782
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000
And you know, let's say you're running up a decent hill.

783
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Like, I don't care who you are.

784
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
When you sprint up a hill, you're going to be tired.

785
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
But an elk does not work.

786
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000
It's no factor whatsoever.

787
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.000
They're just they're going up hills as if you're just walking across this.

788
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Yeah.

789
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Sidewalk.

790
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Yeah.

791
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Not even breathing.

792
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000
All right.

793
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:32.000
The, uh, you don't want you watch National Geographic or something like this.

794
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Where you see these animals.

795
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000
And you know, like, yeah, you see the obvious big ones that elephant and the buff.

796
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000
And the buff a lot of you're like, oh, yeah, that's big.

797
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.000
But men, a wild animal, even if it's kind of the smaller, like, I'm quite

798
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000
There's these little goats.

799
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Right.

800
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
These goats that cruise on the mountains and stuff.

801
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
And from far away, like, oh, look at that goat.

802
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.000
But you start to get, I mean, I haven't been right up to one a while

803
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
to one, but as you kind of can see them close to you, like, man,

804
01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000
the things kind of intimidating just how like capable it is.

805
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
You know, like, so these elk's like, they get kind of big.

806
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Yeah.

807
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Like, it's not like a little deer, like, I don't like, you know, when you watch, like,

808
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.000
you know, when you watch like, bam, be these deer's, they're just so, so, like,

809
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
fragile these things in and out.

810
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:20.000
And they fight each other and they fight each other and they just throw down.

811
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
It's crazy to watch.

812
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:22.000
It's crazy to watch.

813
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000
And it's, you know, it's, it's an awesome experience.

814
01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Yeah.

815
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
It's just, like, you know, like, when you think of like, who, you know,

816
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.000
these people, whatever kids, they're like, yeah, I'm a tiger,

817
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000
or I'm a lion and it's like, yeah, obviously, you know,

818
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
lions are, for us just sure.

819
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:43.000
But in real life, like, a wild animal, like, a elk, for example,

820
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
but when you go up to it, you're like,

821
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
brother, that thing is for us.

822
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.000
You know, like, you don't realize that, you see it on a YouTube video,

823
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
or something like that.

824
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Everyone's in a wild, maybe, like, if they're, you know,

825
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
involved in certain actions.

826
01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.000
But, well, you know how strong, like, let's say a lizard.

827
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.96
Like, you know, when you grab a lizard or just a

828
01:32:02.96 --> 01:32:05.96
small animal, like, how strong a small animal is,

829
01:32:05.96 --> 01:32:08.96
compared to a human right for, like, pound for pound.

830
01:32:08.96 --> 01:32:09.96
Yeah.

831
01:32:09.96 --> 01:32:12.96
So then you think what's that like when this thing weighs 800 pounds,

832
01:32:12.96 --> 01:32:15.96
you know, you think, because they're exponentially stronger than

833
01:32:15.96 --> 01:32:17.96
weak humans.

834
01:32:17.96 --> 01:32:18.96
Yeah.

835
01:32:18.96 --> 01:32:19.96
Let's face it.

836
01:32:19.96 --> 01:32:22.96
We're as weak as a animal.

837
01:32:22.96 --> 01:32:23.96
Yeah.

838
01:32:23.96 --> 01:32:25.96
We're just kind of pathetic as an animal.

839
01:32:25.96 --> 01:32:26.96
I think no.

840
01:32:26.96 --> 01:32:31.96
You know, compared to what, the average elk can sprint up a hill,

841
01:32:31.96 --> 01:32:34.96
like it's nothing, like it's nothing.

842
01:32:34.96 --> 01:32:38.96
And by the way, it can ram its freaking head into stuff.

843
01:32:38.96 --> 01:32:39.96
They kill each other.

844
01:32:39.96 --> 01:32:40.96
They kill each other.

845
01:32:40.96 --> 01:32:43.96
We saw, we saw bodies on the ground.

846
01:32:43.96 --> 01:32:46.96
Elk bodies on the ground from fights.

847
01:32:46.96 --> 01:32:48.96
And the other elk aren't super concerned about it,

848
01:32:48.96 --> 01:32:50.96
because that's just kind of a thing.

849
01:32:50.96 --> 01:32:53.96
You know, you're going to get, you're going to be some casualties out there.

850
01:32:53.96 --> 01:32:56.96
That's the light in these scenarios.

851
01:32:56.96 --> 01:32:57.96
That's death.

852
01:32:57.96 --> 01:32:59.96
And what, you guys out there, what, no cell phone,

853
01:32:59.96 --> 01:33:01.96
no nothing or yet service or what?

854
01:33:01.96 --> 01:33:02.96
Like what kind?

855
01:33:02.96 --> 01:33:03.96
Very limited service.

856
01:33:03.96 --> 01:33:04.96
Okay.

857
01:33:04.96 --> 01:33:05.96
Spani.

858
01:33:05.96 --> 01:33:06.96
Yeah.

859
01:33:06.96 --> 01:33:10.96
I mean, very, like, whether there's one little hill we'd go over and at the top,

860
01:33:10.96 --> 01:33:12.96
you might catch a bar.

861
01:33:12.96 --> 01:33:13.96
Yeah.

862
01:33:13.96 --> 01:33:15.96
You know, I'd get 78 texts.

863
01:33:15.96 --> 01:33:16.96
Yeah.

864
01:33:16.96 --> 01:33:17.96
And then I just look out of the gums.

865
01:33:17.96 --> 01:33:19.96
I'm just going to keep walking until my service goes away.

866
01:33:19.96 --> 01:33:20.96
Yeah.

867
01:33:20.96 --> 01:33:24.96
I got, or I sent you a picture of something.

868
01:33:24.96 --> 01:33:26.96
And you know, how like when you send a picture, somebody will say,

869
01:33:26.96 --> 01:33:28.96
delivered, you know, didn't say delivered.

870
01:33:28.96 --> 01:33:31.96
For like a long time, like, later that day, I looked in.

871
01:33:31.96 --> 01:33:33.96
Yeah, because I went over the top of that hill,

872
01:33:33.96 --> 01:33:34.96
chasing an elk somewhere.

873
01:33:34.96 --> 01:33:36.96
But awesome experience.

874
01:33:36.96 --> 01:33:37.96
Good man.

875
01:33:37.96 --> 01:33:38.96
Well, no elk this time.

876
01:33:38.96 --> 01:33:39.96
No, yep.

877
01:33:39.96 --> 01:33:39.96
Empty hand.

878
01:33:39.96 --> 01:33:43.96
I was going to say awesome experiences, but I also have to add empty handed.

879
01:33:43.96 --> 01:33:45.96
But knock on TV.

880
01:33:45.96 --> 01:33:46.96
Yep.

881
01:33:46.96 --> 01:33:47.96
Right.

882
01:33:47.96 --> 01:33:48.96
I follow them.

883
01:33:48.96 --> 01:33:48.96
Yep.

884
01:33:48.96 --> 01:33:50.96
And there was a picture early on.

885
01:33:50.96 --> 01:33:51.96
Yep.

886
01:33:51.96 --> 01:33:52.96
Of an elk like close.

887
01:33:52.96 --> 01:33:53.96
Yeah.

888
01:33:53.96 --> 01:33:55.96
I got up and with that scenario.

889
01:33:55.96 --> 01:34:00.96
Well, so where we are hunting, you have to take elk that are of a certain age.

890
01:34:00.96 --> 01:34:03.96
Oh, and what they're not old enough, you don't shoot them.

891
01:34:03.96 --> 01:34:04.96
Yeah.

892
01:34:04.96 --> 01:34:07.96
And so I ran into quite a few elk like that.

893
01:34:07.96 --> 01:34:09.96
It was very, it was very unlucky.

894
01:34:09.96 --> 01:34:12.96
Some, and look, look, is it okay?

895
01:34:12.96 --> 01:34:14.96
Am I saying, I just didn't get lucky?

896
01:34:14.96 --> 01:34:19.96
I'm telling you, I tried my hardest man.

897
01:34:19.96 --> 01:34:21.96
So, you know, I tried my hardest man.

898
01:34:21.96 --> 01:34:22.96
We spent a lot of time out there.

899
01:34:22.96 --> 01:34:24.96
We did everything we could.

900
01:34:24.96 --> 01:34:26.96
Doug Lee's an amazing hunter.

901
01:34:26.96 --> 01:34:29.96
We had a guide with us amazing hunter.

902
01:34:29.96 --> 01:34:33.96
And, you know, the scenario that you put into is good of a scenario.

903
01:34:33.96 --> 01:34:36.96
So you can get really for for elk hunting.

904
01:34:36.96 --> 01:34:39.96
But it's still not a guarantee, man.

905
01:34:39.96 --> 01:34:45.96
And we spent, you know, many, many hours in a hiked very far.

906
01:34:45.96 --> 01:34:47.96
Why does long as we could?

907
01:34:47.96 --> 01:34:48.96
You know, it's trying to get it done.

908
01:34:48.96 --> 01:34:49.96
And it doesn't happen.

909
01:34:49.96 --> 01:34:53.96
So, you know, what you get out of, I got a lot of experience.

910
01:34:53.96 --> 01:34:55.96
I mean, I got a lot of experience out of it.

911
01:34:55.96 --> 01:35:00.96
Obviously hanging out with a bunch of great guys up there, just a bunch of great people.

912
01:35:00.96 --> 01:35:02.96
And so that's, that's awesome.

913
01:35:02.96 --> 01:35:05.96
But it's also humbling, you know, it's humbling.

914
01:35:05.96 --> 01:35:06.96
You don't always win, man.

915
01:35:06.96 --> 01:35:10.96
And if it bombs you out that you don't win, find a different thing to do.

916
01:35:10.96 --> 01:35:11.96
Because you're not always going to win.

917
01:35:11.96 --> 01:35:12.96
It's like you're jittering that way.

918
01:35:12.96 --> 01:35:15.96
Like if you just want to win in jitter, you don't train.

919
01:35:15.96 --> 01:35:16.96
Because you're not just going to win.

920
01:35:16.96 --> 01:35:18.96
You know, it's not going to happen.

921
01:35:18.96 --> 01:35:20.96
Yeah, in fact, you kind of, I mean,

922
01:35:20.96 --> 01:35:23.96
especially the whole journey, you lose,

923
01:35:23.96 --> 01:35:28.96
especially on your way up, you're losing way more than you're winning in any capacity.

924
01:35:28.96 --> 01:35:29.96
Oh, you did.

925
01:35:29.96 --> 01:35:30.96
Oh, yeah, for sure.

926
01:35:30.96 --> 01:35:33.96
And I feel like in this Elk scenario too, where, man,

927
01:35:33.96 --> 01:35:36.96
it's kind of like if you get one, that's like,

928
01:35:36.96 --> 01:35:38.96
that's like a big deal, you know?

929
01:35:38.96 --> 01:35:39.96
It's a huge deal.

930
01:35:39.96 --> 01:35:40.96
Yeah.

931
01:35:40.96 --> 01:35:41.96
It's a huge deal.

932
01:35:41.96 --> 01:35:44.96
Like you not getting one, and I don't even know about Elk hunting, by the way.

933
01:35:44.96 --> 01:35:46.96
But you not getting one, I wasn't like,

934
01:35:46.96 --> 01:35:47.96
oh, that's surprising.

935
01:35:47.96 --> 01:35:49.96
I was like, well, that makes sense to me.

936
01:35:49.96 --> 01:35:50.96
You can go for weeks.

937
01:35:50.96 --> 01:35:51.96
Yeah.

938
01:35:51.96 --> 01:35:54.96
And there's the scenario that I'm hunting in is a very,

939
01:35:54.96 --> 01:35:56.96
it's the best scenario you can put into.

940
01:35:56.96 --> 01:35:59.96
Most people that hunt are going out,

941
01:35:59.96 --> 01:36:01.96
what they call a public land hunt,

942
01:36:01.96 --> 01:36:03.96
where you're just going out in the wild.

943
01:36:03.96 --> 01:36:04.96
Yes.

944
01:36:04.96 --> 01:36:07.96
I'm going to more controlled environment,

945
01:36:07.96 --> 01:36:10.96
where there's, where there's,

946
01:36:10.96 --> 01:36:15.96
they have a better sense of the number of elk that are there.

947
01:36:15.96 --> 01:36:17.96
And that's why it's controlled like that.

948
01:36:17.96 --> 01:36:19.96
So, but like I said, hey,

949
01:36:19.96 --> 01:36:21.96
we're even with all those things stacked in my favorite.

950
01:36:21.96 --> 01:36:23.96
I ain't no guarantee, you know?

951
01:36:23.96 --> 01:36:26.96
I'm living proof of that.

952
01:36:26.96 --> 01:36:28.96
Because we tried, man.

953
01:36:28.96 --> 01:36:30.96
We tried, then I appreciate everyone's help,

954
01:36:30.96 --> 01:36:32.96
you know, that, you know?

955
01:36:32.96 --> 01:36:36.96
I mean, just a training and learn not a shoot.

956
01:36:36.96 --> 01:36:40.96
Just good, just good people trying to try to make it happen.

957
01:36:40.96 --> 01:36:43.96
But, yeah, that's like a crazy feeling to,

958
01:36:43.96 --> 01:36:46.96
about what else young, I used to make slingshots.

959
01:36:46.96 --> 01:36:48.96
Yeah, you cut the guava tree.

960
01:36:48.96 --> 01:36:49.96
The white part.

961
01:36:49.96 --> 01:36:50.96
For sure.

962
01:36:50.96 --> 01:36:50.96
For sure.

963
01:36:50.96 --> 01:36:51.96
So you cut it.

964
01:36:51.96 --> 01:36:52.96
Boom.

965
01:36:52.96 --> 01:36:54.96
I used to skin it and sand it and when I make it look cool,

966
01:36:54.96 --> 01:36:55.96
but what would you write on there?

967
01:36:55.96 --> 01:36:56.96
Terminator 9.

968
01:36:56.96 --> 01:36:58.96
Amy.

969
01:36:58.96 --> 01:37:01.96
So, what was that weapon you used in somebody

970
01:37:01.96 --> 01:37:03.96
with a spreader spreader, yeah, contra?

971
01:37:03.96 --> 01:37:05.96
Yeah, you tried to do it spreader.

972
01:37:05.96 --> 01:37:07.96
I just think I did it.

973
01:37:07.96 --> 01:37:10.96
Amy, you put, uh,

974
01:37:10.96 --> 01:37:12.96
made out of, yeah, the guava tree.

975
01:37:12.96 --> 01:37:14.96
And then you cut it, then you put, um,

976
01:37:14.96 --> 01:37:15.96
surgical tubing.

977
01:37:15.96 --> 01:37:16.96
Yeah, there's different.

978
01:37:16.96 --> 01:37:17.96
Oh, bro.

979
01:37:17.96 --> 01:37:18.96
I mean, I made some shots too.

980
01:37:18.96 --> 01:37:19.96
Oh, yeah.

981
01:37:19.96 --> 01:37:20.96
Those are your deals.

982
01:37:20.96 --> 01:37:21.96
Yeah.

983
01:37:21.96 --> 01:37:25.96
Anyway, so you go out and you're trying to, like, hunt little birds and stuff.

984
01:37:25.96 --> 01:37:26.96
Right?

985
01:37:26.96 --> 01:37:27.96
And it's like, right?

986
01:37:27.96 --> 01:37:28.96
It's like, kind of hard.

987
01:37:28.96 --> 01:37:31.96
It's not, you don't just, you're not just whacking birds all day.

988
01:37:31.96 --> 01:37:32.96
You're like, you're missing pretty much.

989
01:37:32.96 --> 01:37:34.96
So when you get one, it's like a huge, huge deal.

990
01:37:34.96 --> 01:37:37.96
So I kind of understand, but the elk's the same thing.

991
01:37:37.96 --> 01:37:38.96
You seem to say.

992
01:37:38.96 --> 01:37:39.96
Dude, exactly.

993
01:37:39.96 --> 01:37:40.96
Yeah, exactly.

994
01:37:40.96 --> 01:37:43.96
Anyway, so you're not injured.

995
01:37:43.96 --> 01:37:46.96
That's good, you know, some cut, some bruises.

996
01:37:46.96 --> 01:37:47.96
That's good.

997
01:37:47.96 --> 01:37:48.96
Yep.

998
01:37:48.96 --> 01:37:49.96
I'm saying injuries.

999
01:37:49.96 --> 01:37:51.96
And injuries all part of the game.

1000
01:37:51.96 --> 01:37:53.96
For sure.

1001
01:37:53.96 --> 01:37:54.96
You have to contend with injuries.

1002
01:37:54.96 --> 01:37:55.96
Yeah.

1003
01:37:55.96 --> 01:37:56.96
100%.

1004
01:37:56.96 --> 01:37:57.96
They're all in play.

1005
01:37:57.96 --> 01:37:58.96
Let me say, and I hate to say this.

1006
01:37:58.96 --> 01:38:01.96
Maybe you can correct me if you think I'm wrong.

1007
01:38:01.96 --> 01:38:09.96
But I would go so far as to say, if you're getting zero injuries, you might need to step it up a little bit.

1008
01:38:09.96 --> 01:38:10.96
Right?

1009
01:38:10.96 --> 01:38:11.96
I'm not saying you want to get injured.

1010
01:38:11.96 --> 01:38:12.96
Yeah.

1011
01:38:12.96 --> 01:38:14.96
I hate being injured.

1012
01:38:14.96 --> 01:38:15.96
Yeah.

1013
01:38:15.96 --> 01:38:20.96
But the only way to complete the avoid injury is playing video games.

1014
01:38:20.96 --> 01:38:24.96
Which even that, I guess you could get carpooled tunnel syndrome or something.

1015
01:38:24.96 --> 01:38:27.96
Carpooled tunnel, I think, is like more of a typing thing.

1016
01:38:27.96 --> 01:38:29.96
Or like, put it all this, pronated, supinated, right?

1017
01:38:29.96 --> 01:38:30.96
Assing.

1018
01:38:30.96 --> 01:38:31.96
Greg Train.

1019
01:38:31.96 --> 01:38:32.96
Yeah.

1020
01:38:32.96 --> 01:38:33.96
Greg Train whenever he's explaining moves.

1021
01:38:33.96 --> 01:38:35.96
He's using his medical tools.

1022
01:38:35.96 --> 01:38:36.96
And a ton of cool pills.

1023
01:38:36.96 --> 01:38:37.96
Yeah.

1024
01:38:37.96 --> 01:38:38.96
Yeah.

1025
01:38:38.96 --> 01:38:39.96
All right.

1026
01:38:39.96 --> 01:38:40.96
So what are you getting at, bro?

1027
01:38:40.96 --> 01:38:41.96
Long side shot.

1028
01:38:41.96 --> 01:38:44.96
Well, it wasn't necessarily getting at anything.

1029
01:38:44.96 --> 01:38:48.96
I'm just trying to re, like, visit kind of where we all are.

1030
01:38:48.96 --> 01:38:50.96
You know, but you make a good point.

1031
01:38:50.96 --> 01:38:54.96
Like where, yeah, you're not, of course you're not saying, I don't think it can be.

1032
01:38:54.96 --> 01:38:59.96
I'm sure it can be, but I'm, I'm not interpreting it as like, yes, you should pursue getting injured.

1033
01:38:59.96 --> 01:39:02.96
And that's what you know, your heart, no, it's not that.

1034
01:39:02.96 --> 01:39:06.96
But with most exercise, most worth it exercise.

1035
01:39:06.96 --> 01:39:08.96
It's going to come with an element of risk.

1036
01:39:08.96 --> 01:39:13.96
So whether you're pushing hard, whether you're going through dynamic terrain, whether you,

1037
01:39:13.96 --> 01:39:18.96
and which can be, if you do different things, whether it be due to you, even like long distance outdoor running.

1038
01:39:18.96 --> 01:39:19.96
Oh, for sure.

1039
01:39:19.96 --> 01:39:21.96
This is like, this is all for real stuff.

1040
01:39:21.96 --> 01:39:23.96
Cliff, client, you know, all this stuff.

1041
01:39:23.96 --> 01:39:26.96
So yes, client, you know, that's not my jam.

1042
01:39:26.96 --> 01:39:28.96
Obviously, I don't know what's called cliff.

1043
01:39:28.96 --> 01:39:29.96
What is it called?

1044
01:39:29.96 --> 01:39:31.96
That's just called rock climbing rock climbing.

1045
01:39:31.96 --> 01:39:32.96
Cliff climbing.

1046
01:39:32.96 --> 01:39:34.96
I mean, technically, right?

1047
01:39:34.96 --> 01:39:36.96
All our rocks and they are cliffs.

1048
01:39:36.96 --> 01:39:37.96
Yeah.

1049
01:39:37.96 --> 01:39:38.96
And then they are going to be a little bit more difficult.

1050
01:39:38.96 --> 01:39:41.96
Anyway, as we get older or sling shot, hunting.

1051
01:39:41.96 --> 01:39:42.96
Very similar to Alcantin.

1052
01:39:42.96 --> 01:39:43.96
Sometimes.

1053
01:39:43.96 --> 01:39:45.96
Same thing for much.

1054
01:39:45.96 --> 01:39:47.96
Same thing for much.

1055
01:39:47.96 --> 01:39:49.96
You can be very similar.

1056
01:39:49.96 --> 01:39:57.96
Well, on our way through this path, whatever it may be, exercise wise, we do need supplementation.

1057
01:39:57.96 --> 01:40:01.96
Sometimes not just be not just exercise, but also cognitive lead.

1058
01:40:01.96 --> 01:40:04.96
Sometimes we want supplementation as well.

1059
01:40:04.96 --> 01:40:11.96
Oh, yeah, to to to reap full benefits of that the path provides yes, I agree.

1060
01:40:11.96 --> 01:40:13.96
So let's talk about Choco few.

1061
01:40:13.96 --> 01:40:15.96
Got you supplementation all day physical way.

1062
01:40:15.96 --> 01:40:19.96
Okay, so we start with the foundation, the structure.

1063
01:40:19.96 --> 01:40:22.96
Doesn't mean as much in my experience anyway.

1064
01:40:22.96 --> 01:40:25.96
I've only lived one life, of course, so far.

1065
01:40:25.96 --> 01:40:31.96
Early on in life versus later on in life, it seems like the structure kind of

1066
01:40:31.96 --> 01:40:34.96
signifies more significant in my experience.

1067
01:40:34.96 --> 01:40:36.96
You don't worry about your joints.

1068
01:40:36.96 --> 01:40:37.96
You know, you're back.

1069
01:40:37.96 --> 01:40:41.96
You know how like people like when you get when you get, um, like, trainers, they'll be like,

1070
01:40:41.96 --> 01:40:43.96
hey, you need to start with your core.

1071
01:40:43.96 --> 01:40:44.96
Right.

1072
01:40:44.96 --> 01:40:45.96
You seem to say, yeah.

1073
01:40:45.96 --> 01:40:47.96
Because your core is where you're based in all this stuff, right?

1074
01:40:47.96 --> 01:40:48.96
Let's face it when you're young.

1075
01:40:48.96 --> 01:40:49.96
You're like core.

1076
01:40:49.96 --> 01:40:51.96
What about what are you even talking about?

1077
01:40:51.96 --> 01:40:52.96
You're just thinking arm.

1078
01:40:52.96 --> 01:40:53.96
Get on that.

1079
01:40:53.96 --> 01:40:54.96
That's an inch.

1080
01:40:54.96 --> 01:40:55.96
See, what's up with that bitch?

1081
01:40:55.96 --> 01:40:56.96
Yeah.

1082
01:40:56.96 --> 01:40:58.96
And those doing core max out anyway.

1083
01:40:58.96 --> 01:41:00.96
But as you grow older you understand.

1084
01:41:00.96 --> 01:41:03.96
So I just said a thing core max outs, even to make fun of it.

1085
01:41:03.96 --> 01:41:06.96
Because I've never heard that before, but it's very funny.

1086
01:41:06.96 --> 01:41:07.96
Okay.

1087
01:41:07.96 --> 01:41:09.96
But hey, let's do some core max outs.

1088
01:41:09.96 --> 01:41:10.96
What do you max?

1089
01:41:10.96 --> 01:41:11.96
Or I don't know.

1090
01:41:11.96 --> 01:41:12.96
I don't know.

1091
01:41:12.96 --> 01:41:15.96
I just made it up, but it sounded correct.

1092
01:41:15.96 --> 01:41:18.96
And given the circumstances on the last.

1093
01:41:18.96 --> 01:41:21.96
The point is, joints joint warfare.

1094
01:41:21.96 --> 01:41:22.96
This is what's going to be.

1095
01:41:22.96 --> 01:41:23.96
Okay.

1096
01:41:23.96 --> 01:41:24.96
Jockel joint warfare.

1097
01:41:24.96 --> 01:41:25.96
This is supplementation for your joints.

1098
01:41:25.96 --> 01:41:28.96
Keep them in check and check in the game.

1099
01:41:28.96 --> 01:41:30.96
Start at the foundation.

1100
01:41:30.96 --> 01:41:32.96
Probably had a little knee.

1101
01:41:32.96 --> 01:41:34.96
Tweet while we were up in the mountains.

1102
01:41:34.96 --> 01:41:38.96
And he was just dosing joint, not warfare.

1103
01:41:38.96 --> 01:41:43.96
And he was in a, he was in like an echo Charles situation where he didn't have it.

1104
01:41:43.96 --> 01:41:45.96
And then he went back on it.

1105
01:41:45.96 --> 01:41:47.96
And his knee was using it with power through.

1106
01:41:47.96 --> 01:41:49.96
You went bersideuses.

1107
01:41:49.96 --> 01:41:50.96
Yes.

1108
01:41:50.96 --> 01:41:51.96
Okay.

1109
01:41:51.96 --> 01:41:52.96
So I get, I've had it before.

1110
01:41:52.96 --> 01:41:54.96
I've had bersides on my shoulder and my heel.

1111
01:41:54.96 --> 01:41:56.96
Yeah, my heel.

1112
01:41:56.96 --> 01:41:57.96
It's weird.

1113
01:41:57.96 --> 01:42:01.96
So I get bersideous now when,

1114
01:42:01.96 --> 01:42:03.96
cos they didn't do this before.

1115
01:42:03.96 --> 01:42:05.96
I do deep squats barefoot.

1116
01:42:05.96 --> 01:42:08.96
Check for some reason I get bersideous in my heel.

1117
01:42:08.96 --> 01:42:10.96
Just genetic weakness really.

1118
01:42:10.96 --> 01:42:11.96
It's possible.

1119
01:42:11.96 --> 01:42:14.96
Nonetheless, when these things happen,

1120
01:42:14.96 --> 01:42:16.96
I have this weird, like confidence.

1121
01:42:16.96 --> 01:42:17.96
Like it'll happen.

1122
01:42:17.96 --> 01:42:18.96
Like I'll do it in the next day.

1123
01:42:18.96 --> 01:42:19.96
Like I'll be walking on this just like,

1124
01:42:19.96 --> 01:42:20.96
Oh man.

1125
01:42:20.96 --> 01:42:22.96
Like it feels like almost like a shariot.

1126
01:42:22.96 --> 01:42:24.96
So it's a weird, very distinct feeling in your heel.

1127
01:42:24.96 --> 01:42:27.96
But I always have this weird, like subconscious,

1128
01:42:27.96 --> 01:42:29.96
almost feeling that,

1129
01:42:29.96 --> 01:42:31.96
like, oh, this is going to be gone immediately.

1130
01:42:31.96 --> 01:42:33.96
Even though it's like really bad.

1131
01:42:33.96 --> 01:42:36.96
So you know, when you have injury, then you have full recovery.

1132
01:42:36.96 --> 01:42:37.96
Yep.

1133
01:42:37.96 --> 01:42:39.96
That time to me just feels like in my brain.

1134
01:42:39.96 --> 01:42:42.96
I'm so confident that that time is going to be like almost no time.

1135
01:42:42.96 --> 01:42:43.96
Cos that next day.

1136
01:42:43.96 --> 01:42:44.96
Cos it's a joint work.

1137
01:42:44.96 --> 01:42:45.96
Cos you're on the joint work for you.

1138
01:42:45.96 --> 01:42:46.96
That's how it feels.

1139
01:42:46.96 --> 01:42:47.96
And the krill oil really.

1140
01:42:47.96 --> 01:42:48.96
Right. Yeah.

1141
01:42:48.96 --> 01:42:49.96
The combo 100%.

1142
01:42:49.96 --> 01:42:51.96
So sure enough.

1143
01:42:51.96 --> 01:42:53.96
Next day, it's still sore.

1144
01:42:53.96 --> 01:42:56.96
Like, fric, this is like, this might be something serious.

1145
01:42:56.96 --> 01:42:57.96
You know, like it might be bad.

1146
01:42:57.96 --> 01:42:59.96
The next day after that, pretty much gone.

1147
01:42:59.96 --> 01:42:59.96
Yeah.

1148
01:42:59.96 --> 01:43:02.96
It's like it just, it's like a desire to just be.

1149
01:43:02.96 --> 01:43:05.96
I just feel like, you know, it's one of those, one of those deals.

1150
01:43:05.96 --> 01:43:07.96
Nonetheless, so if you're going to work for it.

1151
01:43:07.96 --> 01:43:10.96
Krill oil discipline discipline go.

1152
01:43:10.96 --> 01:43:11.96
Yes.

1153
01:43:11.96 --> 01:43:13.96
Well, let's start mulk.

1154
01:43:13.96 --> 01:43:17.96
So from the final, like consider the foundation and then you start to go.

1155
01:43:17.96 --> 01:43:18.96
You have built.

1156
01:43:18.96 --> 01:43:19.96
You got to build.

1157
01:43:19.96 --> 01:43:20.96
Seems same.

1158
01:43:20.96 --> 01:43:23.96
So you can be doing curls shoulder press.

1159
01:43:23.96 --> 01:43:25.96
Lot raises building up the upper body.

1160
01:43:25.96 --> 01:43:26.96
Right.

1161
01:43:26.96 --> 01:43:27.96
Won't be nothing.

1162
01:43:27.96 --> 01:43:29.96
Why does that get a whispers?

1163
01:43:29.96 --> 01:43:33.96
And what would be anything if you joined the jammed up.

1164
01:43:33.96 --> 01:43:34.96
So you got to take care.

1165
01:43:34.96 --> 01:43:35.96
So now go up.

1166
01:43:35.96 --> 01:43:36.96
Now when you're doing the bench.

1167
01:43:36.96 --> 01:43:39.96
When you're doing that in your case, deadlift, whatever you do.

1168
01:43:39.96 --> 01:43:41.96
These squats all day.

1169
01:43:41.96 --> 01:43:45.96
You're going to need the protein supplementation for rebuilding.

1170
01:43:45.96 --> 01:43:48.96
That's when you implement the mulk.

1171
01:43:48.96 --> 01:43:51.96
I had mulk with me on my trip.

1172
01:43:51.96 --> 01:43:54.96
And like we said, I say one night, I'll hold you up.

1173
01:43:54.96 --> 01:43:55.96
The head and up there.

1174
01:43:55.96 --> 01:43:56.96
Mulk.

1175
01:43:56.96 --> 01:43:57.96
See, roughing it up.

1176
01:43:57.96 --> 01:43:58.96
We'll do it.

1177
01:43:58.96 --> 01:43:59.96
See it.

1178
01:43:59.96 --> 01:44:00.96
Good.

1179
01:44:00.96 --> 01:44:02.96
You know, they got the little, well, here's the thing.

1180
01:44:02.96 --> 01:44:03.96
They got the little travel.

1181
01:44:03.96 --> 01:44:04.96
Sam Pabach.

1182
01:44:04.96 --> 01:44:05.96
Yeah, yeah, you brought them.

1183
01:44:05.96 --> 01:44:06.96
Those things got awesome.

1184
01:44:06.96 --> 01:44:07.96
Yeah.

1185
01:44:07.96 --> 01:44:10.96
You know, in an airport, you can't bring fluid through.

1186
01:44:10.96 --> 01:44:11.96
So you just walk through.

1187
01:44:11.96 --> 01:44:14.96
Get yourself a little milk with your mulk pouch.

1188
01:44:14.96 --> 01:44:15.96
Sure.

1189
01:44:15.96 --> 01:44:16.96
And they'll probably break it out.

1190
01:44:16.96 --> 01:44:17.96
Yeah.

1191
01:44:17.96 --> 01:44:18.96
But actually, that is good.

1192
01:44:18.96 --> 01:44:21.96
Because I have a bunch of those, the little packs.

1193
01:44:21.96 --> 01:44:23.96
I think they're like from the musters and stuff.

1194
01:44:23.96 --> 01:44:24.96
And you know, peek at you.

1195
01:44:24.96 --> 01:44:25.96
Send them to me.

1196
01:44:25.96 --> 01:44:26.96
Okay.

1197
01:44:26.96 --> 01:44:27.96
I don't bus into that at home.

1198
01:44:27.96 --> 01:44:28.96
Yeah, that's a joke.

1199
01:44:28.96 --> 01:44:29.96
I'm very rude.

1200
01:44:29.96 --> 01:44:30.96
Yeah, that's good, man.

1201
01:44:30.96 --> 01:44:31.96
It's good move.

1202
01:44:31.96 --> 01:44:33.96
And the last it's there for long time.

1203
01:44:33.96 --> 01:44:35.96
I'm trying to explain it to you.

1204
01:44:35.96 --> 01:44:37.96
You know, trying to make you elaborate.

1205
01:44:37.96 --> 01:44:38.96
I'm going to be good.

1206
01:44:38.96 --> 01:44:39.96
Okay.

1207
01:44:39.96 --> 01:44:41.96
So if you can, you see if you can go.

1208
01:44:41.96 --> 01:44:44.96
These are things that I feel are beneficial to know.

1209
01:44:44.96 --> 01:44:47.96
If you see it as an it's entirety as a system.

1210
01:44:47.96 --> 01:44:50.96
I'm trying to stay quiet.

1211
01:44:50.96 --> 01:44:51.96
But now you're getting crazy.

1212
01:44:51.96 --> 01:44:52.96
There you go.

1213
01:44:52.96 --> 01:44:53.96
Okay.

1214
01:44:53.96 --> 01:44:54.96
So you're, okay.

1215
01:44:54.96 --> 01:44:55.96
Your joints are taking care of already.

1216
01:44:55.96 --> 01:44:56.96
All good.

1217
01:44:56.96 --> 01:44:57.96
Your muscles boom.

1218
01:44:57.96 --> 01:44:58.96
You work on breaking down rebuild them.

1219
01:44:58.96 --> 01:44:59.96
Mulk.

1220
01:44:59.96 --> 01:45:02.96
Supplemental protein in the form of your dessert.

1221
01:45:02.96 --> 01:45:03.96
All good.

1222
01:45:03.96 --> 01:45:04.96
Work in mulk too.

1223
01:45:04.96 --> 01:45:06.96
By the way, if your kids, you need general protein.

1224
01:45:06.96 --> 01:45:08.96
And they like, you know, the dessert scenario as well.

1225
01:45:08.96 --> 01:45:09.96
So that's available.

1226
01:45:09.96 --> 01:45:11.96
Then you body.

1227
01:45:11.96 --> 01:45:12.96
All good.

1228
01:45:12.96 --> 01:45:13.96
All degenerate.

1229
01:45:13.96 --> 01:45:15.96
Regenerating regenerating.

1230
01:45:15.96 --> 01:45:17.96
Bigger all good structure foundation.

1231
01:45:17.96 --> 01:45:18.96
All good.

1232
01:45:18.96 --> 01:45:19.96
Now you need the mind.

1233
01:45:19.96 --> 01:45:20.96
Your mind.

1234
01:45:20.96 --> 01:45:21.96
Keep you mentally in the game.

1235
01:45:21.96 --> 01:45:22.96
Boom.

1236
01:45:22.96 --> 01:45:23.96
That's where the discipline comes in.

1237
01:45:23.96 --> 01:45:25.96
You're saying discipline discipline go.

1238
01:45:25.96 --> 01:45:27.96
Cands powder whatever you like.

1239
01:45:27.96 --> 01:45:28.96
That's your choice.

1240
01:45:28.96 --> 01:45:29.96
That part is on you.

1241
01:45:29.96 --> 01:45:34.96
I can't give accurate specific guidance on what's.

1242
01:45:34.96 --> 01:45:37.96
Implementation methodology.

1243
01:45:37.96 --> 01:45:39.96
Fair enough.

1244
01:45:39.96 --> 01:45:42.96
Nonetheless, if you're into the energy drinks scenario.

1245
01:45:42.96 --> 01:45:45.96
As you just put it, that's not good.

1246
01:45:45.96 --> 01:45:48.96
If you're into normal energy drinks scenarios, that's not good.

1247
01:45:48.96 --> 01:45:50.96
Because those things are not good for you.

1248
01:45:50.96 --> 01:45:52.96
And I know it might sound crazy.

1249
01:45:52.96 --> 01:45:54.96
But discipline go and it can.

1250
01:45:54.96 --> 01:45:55.96
Is good for you.

1251
01:45:55.96 --> 01:45:56.96
It is good for you.

1252
01:45:56.96 --> 01:45:57.96
Yeah.

1253
01:45:57.96 --> 01:45:59.96
So there's no sugar in there.

1254
01:45:59.96 --> 01:46:01.96
There's vitamins in there.

1255
01:46:01.96 --> 01:46:02.96
There's caffeine.

1256
01:46:02.96 --> 01:46:05.96
95 milligrams of caffeine, which is not some.

1257
01:46:05.96 --> 01:46:06.96
Crazy.

1258
01:46:06.96 --> 01:46:13.96
You know, run around.

1259
01:46:13.96 --> 01:46:16.96
There's some name for dude like this.

1260
01:46:16.96 --> 01:46:18.96
But anyways, you know that dude.

1261
01:46:18.96 --> 01:46:19.96
Yes, sir.

1262
01:46:19.96 --> 01:46:20.96
Yeah, we do.

1263
01:46:20.96 --> 01:46:21.96
This is.

1264
01:46:21.96 --> 01:46:22.96
This is.

1265
01:46:22.96 --> 01:46:23.96
Like a.

1266
01:46:23.96 --> 01:46:24.96
It's just.

1267
01:46:24.96 --> 01:46:25.96
It's just.

1268
01:46:25.96 --> 01:46:26.96
It's good for you.

1269
01:46:26.96 --> 01:46:27.96
Yeah.

1270
01:46:27.96 --> 01:46:27.96
So it.

1271
01:46:27.96 --> 01:46:28.96
Okay.

1272
01:46:28.96 --> 01:46:29.96
So I went kind of.

1273
01:46:29.96 --> 01:46:30.96
Like, okay.

1274
01:46:30.96 --> 01:46:31.96
So I've been talking to Pete.

1275
01:46:31.96 --> 01:46:32.96
And right recently.

1276
01:46:32.96 --> 01:46:34.96
So I, you know, you kind of go deep in these rabbit holes.

1277
01:46:34.96 --> 01:46:35.96
Like, okay.

1278
01:46:35.96 --> 01:46:39.96
So apparently other energy drinks do a lot of wonky stuff with their.

1279
01:46:39.96 --> 01:46:43.96
And it's and it's wonky meaning like they advertise this.

1280
01:46:43.96 --> 01:46:47.96
But then meanwhile they're doing a lot of this other stuff that they sort of omit when they advertise.

1281
01:46:47.96 --> 01:46:49.96
You know, so you just.

1282
01:46:49.96 --> 01:46:53.96
You kind of get maybe more than you've bought you bargain for some.

1283
01:46:53.96 --> 01:46:54.96
In a bad way.

1284
01:46:54.96 --> 01:46:55.96
In a bad way.

1285
01:46:55.96 --> 01:46:56.96
No, sir.

1286
01:46:56.96 --> 01:47:00.96
So and I wound up watching this video was a comedy video for sure.

1287
01:47:00.96 --> 01:47:04.96
It was called like a lot of people make this kind of video like if energy drink,

1288
01:47:04.96 --> 01:47:06.96
like to advertise is where honest.

1289
01:47:06.96 --> 01:47:09.96
And the guy and his like this official guy and he's saying like all this stuff.

1290
01:47:09.96 --> 01:47:12.96
I don't know, he wouldn't talk about any specific energy drink.

1291
01:47:12.96 --> 01:47:13.96
So he's.

1292
01:47:13.96 --> 01:47:16.96
I was like, Bro, he's talking about all this like poison and stuff.

1293
01:47:16.96 --> 01:47:19.96
Like there's what they do to do this and it makes it this and this is not.

1294
01:47:19.96 --> 01:47:24.96
So if when you're consuming your energy drink of death, like saying all this stuff like

1295
01:47:24.96 --> 01:47:28.96
Dang bro, like I don't even know because I used to like energy drinks.

1296
01:47:28.96 --> 01:47:31.96
Yeah, well, you were working late at night and everything.

1297
01:47:31.96 --> 01:47:32.96
Yeah.

1298
01:47:32.96 --> 01:47:34.96
I didn't even press you.

1299
01:47:34.96 --> 01:47:36.96
But now I feel kind of betrayed.

1300
01:47:36.96 --> 01:47:38.96
But I need more discipline.

1301
01:47:38.96 --> 01:47:41.96
Go boom, all day all healthy 100% preserve it is.

1302
01:47:41.96 --> 01:47:42.96
Nope.

1303
01:47:42.96 --> 01:47:43.96
Pasturized.

1304
01:47:43.96 --> 01:47:44.96
Unless get on that.

1305
01:47:44.96 --> 01:47:45.96
Sure.

1306
01:47:45.96 --> 01:47:46.96
Nope, my crew.

1307
01:47:46.96 --> 01:47:47.96
Yeah, my crew.

1308
01:47:47.96 --> 01:47:48.96
No sugar.

1309
01:47:48.96 --> 01:47:49.96
So yeah, all good.

1310
01:47:49.96 --> 01:47:50.96
There it is.

1311
01:47:50.96 --> 01:47:53.96
And while so while you're on the path, that supplementation,

1312
01:47:53.96 --> 01:47:55.96
methodology.

1313
01:47:55.96 --> 01:47:56.96
Perfection.

1314
01:47:56.96 --> 01:47:58.96
It's a perfect system.

1315
01:47:58.96 --> 01:48:04.96
Anyway, you get all these stuff, all this stuff at originmain.com or at the vitamin shop.

1316
01:48:04.96 --> 01:48:10.96
If you're walking in or if you're in Florida or Virginia, we got a little

1317
01:48:10.96 --> 01:48:14.96
situation coming to the wall wall stores.

1318
01:48:14.96 --> 01:48:16.96
We'll be there in October.

1319
01:48:16.96 --> 01:48:17.96
Yeah.

1320
01:48:17.96 --> 01:48:19.96
So they go get some.

1321
01:48:19.96 --> 01:48:23.96
So this is how it goes if you're in Florida or Virginia.

1322
01:48:23.96 --> 01:48:27.96
In the morning, you take the joint warfare before you or depends on when you work out.

1323
01:48:27.96 --> 01:48:31.96
Before the workout on your way to the gym, if you're going to the gym, stop at

1324
01:48:31.96 --> 01:48:36.96
while you get the discipline go boom to the gym hit the gym smash the gym.

1325
01:48:36.96 --> 01:48:39.96
Really smash it.

1326
01:48:39.96 --> 01:48:42.96
Come home, boom, mulk all day.

1327
01:48:42.96 --> 01:48:44.96
You'd be on the path big time.

1328
01:48:44.96 --> 01:48:46.96
Just establish that routine.

1329
01:48:46.96 --> 01:48:48.96
Anyway, back to origin origin origin.

1330
01:48:48.96 --> 01:48:49.96
Or at origin.

1331
01:48:49.96 --> 01:48:52.96
Or at originmain.com.

1332
01:48:52.96 --> 01:48:56.96
Also on there American made stuff straight up.

1333
01:48:56.96 --> 01:49:06.96
Jeans, boots, geese, grasscards, t-shirts, American made stuff, which may not seem like a big deal,

1334
01:49:06.96 --> 01:49:08.96
but it is a huge deal.

1335
01:49:08.96 --> 01:49:10.96
It's a huge deal.

1336
01:49:10.96 --> 01:49:11.96
You know what?

1337
01:49:11.96 --> 01:49:21.96
The typical business scenario is, hey cool, let's start a brand out-sourced to some overseas place.

1338
01:49:21.96 --> 01:49:28.96
Get the prices cheap you can, take advantage of slave labor basically.

1339
01:49:28.96 --> 01:49:33.96
And then we'll bring it back here and we'll sell it for some incredible markup and make a bunch of money

1340
01:49:33.96 --> 01:49:36.96
and not hire anybody because we're just going to keep it all.

1341
01:49:36.96 --> 01:49:38.96
Or you can do what we're doing.

1342
01:49:38.96 --> 01:49:40.96
Build it here.

1343
01:49:40.96 --> 01:49:45.96
Treat workers well because they have awesome value.

1344
01:49:45.96 --> 01:49:48.96
Become self-sufficient as a country.

1345
01:49:48.96 --> 01:49:55.96
Maintain knowledge, ancient knowledge, which is almost lost.

1346
01:49:55.96 --> 01:49:56.96
Almost lost.

1347
01:49:56.96 --> 01:49:57.96
We got it.

1348
01:49:57.96 --> 01:50:02.96
You know that situation when the ball is about to go out of bounds.

1349
01:50:02.96 --> 01:50:04.96
It's just in time.

1350
01:50:04.96 --> 01:50:06.96
That's what origin is doing.

1351
01:50:06.96 --> 01:50:07.96
Just in time.

1352
01:50:07.96 --> 01:50:09.96
To save the knowledge.

1353
01:50:09.96 --> 01:50:15.96
And the big corporations, you know what they say, you cannot make this stuff here.

1354
01:50:15.96 --> 01:50:17.96
It's impossible.

1355
01:50:17.96 --> 01:50:18.96
No, it's not.

1356
01:50:18.96 --> 01:50:20.96
It was done before.

1357
01:50:20.96 --> 01:50:22.96
We're doing it now.

1358
01:50:22.96 --> 01:50:23.96
Watch me.

1359
01:50:23.96 --> 01:50:24.96
Yeah.

1360
01:50:24.96 --> 01:50:28.96
And it's kind of like the genes, for example.

1361
01:50:28.96 --> 01:50:35.96
When you think about it, oh yeah, the designer genes, like when you consider really what are you paying for this.

1362
01:50:35.96 --> 01:50:37.96
It's like whatever the brand.

1363
01:50:37.96 --> 01:50:38.96
But what do you like for real paying for?

1364
01:50:38.96 --> 01:50:41.96
Like what do you care about about those genes?

1365
01:50:41.96 --> 01:50:42.96
You know?

1366
01:50:42.96 --> 01:50:43.96
Sure the fit.

1367
01:50:43.96 --> 01:50:44.96
Okay.

1368
01:50:44.96 --> 01:50:45.96
That's good.

1369
01:50:45.96 --> 01:50:46.96
If that's a thing.

1370
01:50:46.96 --> 01:50:50.96
I've been thinking about that whole aspect of designer genes and you know what?

1371
01:50:50.96 --> 01:50:51.96
These are designer genes.

1372
01:50:51.96 --> 01:50:53.96
They're designed for work.

1373
01:50:53.96 --> 01:50:55.96
They're designed to last.

1374
01:50:55.96 --> 01:50:59.96
They're designed to function properly in all scenarios.

1375
01:50:59.96 --> 01:51:00.96
So they are designer genes.

1376
01:51:00.96 --> 01:51:01.96
They're designed for work.

1377
01:51:01.96 --> 01:51:02.96
Get some of that.

1378
01:51:02.96 --> 01:51:03.96
All right.

1379
01:51:03.96 --> 01:51:04.96
There you go.

1380
01:51:04.96 --> 01:51:05.96
I take.

1381
01:51:05.96 --> 01:51:06.96
Sign you up.

1382
01:51:06.96 --> 01:51:07.96
Oh yeah.

1383
01:51:07.96 --> 01:51:08.96
My favorite genes.

1384
01:51:08.96 --> 01:51:09.96
100%.

1385
01:51:09.96 --> 01:51:10.96
Also.

1386
01:51:10.96 --> 01:51:11.96
Jaco has a store.

1387
01:51:11.96 --> 01:51:12.96
It's called Jaco Store.

1388
01:51:12.96 --> 01:51:14.96
And this is where you can get your shirts.

1389
01:51:14.96 --> 01:51:17.96
While you're on this path, you want to represent this little equals freedom.

1390
01:51:17.96 --> 01:51:18.96
Good.

1391
01:51:18.96 --> 01:51:20.96
We've got shirts, hats, hoodies.

1392
01:51:20.96 --> 01:51:22.96
Newboard shorts.

1393
01:51:22.96 --> 01:51:24.96
By the way.

1394
01:51:24.96 --> 01:51:28.96
Good utility, water, jiu jits.

1395
01:51:28.96 --> 01:51:29.96
All that.

1396
01:51:29.96 --> 01:51:31.96
They're brand new.

1397
01:51:31.96 --> 01:51:32.96
Anyway.

1398
01:51:32.96 --> 01:51:34.96
Uh, the some Irish Oaks Ranch.

1399
01:51:34.96 --> 01:51:36.96

1402
01:51:38.96 --> 01:51:38.96

Here's the thing.

1417
01:51:56.96 --> 01:51:57.96
Go.

1418
01:51:57.96 --> 01:51:58.96
I would say.

1419
01:51:58.96 --> 01:51:59.96
Okay.

1420
01:51:59.96 --> 01:52:00.96
So you, Jaco,

1421
01:52:00.96 --> 01:52:01.96
Villink.

1422
01:52:01.96 --> 01:52:07.96
You currently have the best content as far as comments go.

1423
01:52:07.96 --> 01:52:09.96
So not even necessarily on your.

1424
01:52:09.96 --> 01:52:14.96
You know, the one that the stuff for GQ, the the the the movies or whatever break down the breakdowns.

1425
01:52:14.96 --> 01:52:15.96
And there was another one.

1426
01:52:15.96 --> 01:52:17.96
I think it might have been your TED talk.

1427
01:52:17.96 --> 01:52:18.96
Brad, chariitos comment.

1428
01:52:18.96 --> 01:52:19.96
Bro.

1429
01:52:19.96 --> 01:52:23.96
It's like, uh, like when when Jaco was born,

1430
01:52:23.96 --> 01:52:26.96
the doctor turned to his parents and said,

1431
01:52:26.96 --> 01:52:27.96
It's a man.

1432
01:52:27.96 --> 01:52:28.96
You know, like that kind of.

1433
01:52:28.96 --> 01:52:29.96
So funny.

1434
01:52:29.96 --> 01:52:32.96
Or when Jaco left left for college.

1435
01:52:32.96 --> 01:52:34.96
He told his father,

1436
01:52:34.96 --> 01:52:35.96
You're the man of the house now.

1437
01:52:35.96 --> 01:52:36.96
Brad, you.

1438
01:52:36.96 --> 01:52:38.96
I'm reading these like laughing out.

1439
01:52:38.96 --> 01:52:40.96
I'm reading all these comments.

1440
01:52:40.96 --> 01:52:41.96
Oh, man.

1441
01:52:41.96 --> 01:52:42.96
It's the best.

1442
01:52:42.96 --> 01:52:44.96
Nonetheless, yes, we have a YouTube channel.

1443
01:52:44.96 --> 01:52:47.96
Uh, so yes, subscribe to that too.

1444
01:52:47.96 --> 01:52:49.96
If you want to, if you have one of those, man,

1445
01:52:49.96 --> 01:52:51.96
I don't even care if it's like kind of funny,

1446
01:52:51.96 --> 01:52:52.96
but just just say them.

1447
01:52:52.96 --> 01:52:53.96
Those comments.

1448
01:52:53.96 --> 01:52:54.96
Really good.

1449
01:52:54.96 --> 01:52:55.96
Yeah.

1450
01:52:55.96 --> 01:52:57.96
Uh, we also have other podcasts, by the way.

1451
01:52:57.96 --> 01:52:59.96
We have a podcast called The Unraveling,

1452
01:52:59.96 --> 01:53:01.96
which we are about to launch on its own.

1453
01:53:01.96 --> 01:53:03.96
What feed.

1454
01:53:03.96 --> 01:53:04.96
Yeah.

1455
01:53:04.96 --> 01:53:05.96
So we have that.

1456
01:53:05.96 --> 01:53:06.96
The unraveling.

1457
01:53:06.96 --> 01:53:08.96
Look that up.

1458
01:53:08.96 --> 01:53:10.96
We got more episodes coming.

1459
01:53:10.96 --> 01:53:13.96
We're starting to get caught up to where the episodes are a little bit more.

1460
01:53:13.96 --> 01:53:15.96
Let's say.

1461
01:53:15.96 --> 01:53:17.96
Current to what's happening in the world right now.

1462
01:53:17.96 --> 01:53:18.96
We spent a lot of time of Iraq.

1463
01:53:18.96 --> 01:53:21.96
We've, so we're going to check those out if you want to check those out.

1464
01:53:21.96 --> 01:53:24.96
We got the grounded podcast, which we haven't done a long time.

1465
01:53:24.96 --> 01:53:27.96
Although it kind of seems like we just did what.

1466
01:53:27.96 --> 01:53:30.96
As you tried to explain your methodology for taking more,

1467
01:53:30.96 --> 01:53:31.96
which is fine.

1468
01:53:31.96 --> 01:53:33.96
You know, you know, it's critical.

1469
01:53:33.96 --> 01:53:35.96
It's, you know, we got to use decentralized command here.

1470
01:53:35.96 --> 01:53:37.96
You know, I got to let you run with it sometimes.

1471
01:53:37.96 --> 01:53:38.96
It's all good.

1472
01:53:38.96 --> 01:53:39.96
War your kid podcast.

1473
01:53:39.96 --> 01:53:41.96
Haven't done one of those in a while as well.

1474
01:53:41.96 --> 01:53:44.96
So, sorry.

1475
01:53:44.96 --> 01:53:45.96
Straight up.

1476
01:53:45.96 --> 01:53:46.96
That's it.

1477
01:53:46.96 --> 01:53:47.96
Yeah.

1478
01:53:47.96 --> 01:53:48.96
Well, there you go.

1479
01:53:48.96 --> 01:53:49.96
They're all good podcasts.

1480
01:53:49.96 --> 01:53:50.96
Very valuable.

1481
01:53:50.96 --> 01:53:54.96
But yes, maybe not quite as consistent as the job podcast.

1482
01:53:54.96 --> 01:53:55.96
And you know, it makes sense.

1483
01:53:55.96 --> 01:53:57.96
Anyway, yes, and I mentioned the YouTube channel.

1484
01:53:57.96 --> 01:53:58.96
We have you to channel.

1485
01:53:58.96 --> 01:53:59.96
So yes, video version.

1486
01:53:59.96 --> 01:54:00.96
All that stuff.

1487
01:54:00.96 --> 01:54:01.96
Exerps.

1488
01:54:01.96 --> 01:54:02.96
All good.

1489
01:54:02.96 --> 01:54:03.96
Also psychological warfare.

1490
01:54:03.96 --> 01:54:08.96
You need a boost from Jocco telling you the right thing to do when you're about to do the wrong thing.

1491
01:54:08.96 --> 01:54:11.96
AKA skip or work out AKA eat donuts.

1492
01:54:11.96 --> 01:54:14.96
AKA do do something that you know you're not supposed to do.

1493
01:54:14.96 --> 01:54:15.96
You never plan to do it.

1494
01:54:15.96 --> 01:54:21.96
In fact, you plan not to do it, but a moment of weakness is kind of luring you in whatever you want to talk about it.

1495
01:54:21.96 --> 01:54:23.96
Tell you why you should or shouldn't do something.

1496
01:54:23.96 --> 01:54:24.96
Boom.

1497
01:54:24.96 --> 01:54:25.96
There you go.

1498
01:54:25.96 --> 01:54:26.96
Psychological warfare.

1499
01:54:26.96 --> 01:54:29.96
Don't forget about if you flip side gambas.

1500
01:54:29.96 --> 01:54:31.96
Flipsidegambas.com.

1501
01:54:31.96 --> 01:54:35.96
Dakota Myers company making stuff to hang on your wall.

1502
01:54:35.96 --> 01:54:37.96
That is graphically cool.

1503
01:54:37.96 --> 01:54:39.96
You've got a bunch of books.

1504
01:54:39.96 --> 01:54:42.96
Got this book here called about face.

1505
01:54:42.96 --> 01:54:45.96
I wasn't sure because it's a reissue.

1506
01:54:45.96 --> 01:54:48.96
I wasn't sure if there would be and if this would be,

1507
01:54:48.96 --> 01:54:49.96
quote, a first.

1508
01:54:49.96 --> 01:54:51.96
A dish.

1509
01:54:51.96 --> 01:54:53.96
I just got my copies.

1510
01:54:53.96 --> 01:54:56.96
And I found out that yes indeed,

1511
01:54:56.96 --> 01:54:58.96
what you have with this book.

1512
01:54:58.96 --> 01:55:03.96
This version of this is a first a dish of this version.

1513
01:55:03.96 --> 01:55:05.96
You can see it right there.

1514
01:55:05.96 --> 01:55:07.96
Above where it says Library of Congress.

1515
01:55:07.96 --> 01:55:08.96
Congress.

1516
01:55:08.96 --> 01:55:10.96
There's a numbers one through ten.

1517
01:55:10.96 --> 01:55:13.96
And when this is the first a dish,

1518
01:55:13.96 --> 01:55:15.96
which means the one is there.

1519
01:55:15.96 --> 01:55:17.96
After the first a dish is gone,

1520
01:55:17.96 --> 01:55:19.96
you won't see that one anymore.

1521
01:55:19.96 --> 01:55:20.96
That's a problem.

1522
01:55:20.96 --> 01:55:26.96
So you'll be on second a dish, which pretty much is an awful place to be.

1523
01:55:26.96 --> 01:55:30.96
What's the actual name now?

1524
01:55:30.96 --> 01:55:32.96
You know how it's called about face.

1525
01:55:32.96 --> 01:55:33.96
There's no change to it.

1526
01:55:33.96 --> 01:55:36.96
All it says is for by darker one.

1527
01:55:36.96 --> 01:55:37.96
Okay.

1528
01:55:37.96 --> 01:55:39.96
So there's no other change to it.

1529
01:55:39.96 --> 01:55:42.96
I mean the cover is also a little bit different.

1530
01:55:42.96 --> 01:55:45.96
Yeah, it's actually, I guess a lot different.

1531
01:55:45.96 --> 01:55:47.96
So well, it's not a lot different.

1532
01:55:47.96 --> 01:55:49.96
There's a little bit different.

1533
01:55:49.96 --> 01:55:52.96
So yeah, and we'll link it to the right one.

1534
01:55:52.96 --> 01:55:56.96
And I've been signing about faces for a long time.

1535
01:55:56.96 --> 01:55:58.96
Like people bring me about face and I don't sign them.

1536
01:55:58.96 --> 01:56:01.96
So that's pretty cool.

1537
01:56:01.96 --> 01:56:06.96
And now I get to sign one that is even just a little bit cooler.

1538
01:56:06.96 --> 01:56:10.96
And now you can get a first to start to get a first a dish of the original book.

1539
01:56:10.96 --> 01:56:14.96
Now you can get a first a dish of the re-issue, the relaunch.

1540
01:56:14.96 --> 01:56:15.96
Anyways, check it out.

1541
01:56:15.96 --> 01:56:20.96

If you want, like what I talk about here, you can get more.

1553
01:56:42.96 --> 01:56:49.96
You can get the books and read about it and overlay and understand these things in a much deeper way.

1554
01:56:49.96 --> 01:56:54.96
We also have Ashland front, which is my leadership consultancy where we solve problems through leadership.

We got the master, which is our leadership event.

01:57:31.96 --> 01:57:32.96
We were going to do two earlier this year.

1570
01:57:32.96 --> 01:57:34.96
They both got canceled because of COVID.

1571
01:57:34.96 --> 01:57:38.96
And so people have transferred their tickets over to that one.

1572
01:57:38.96 --> 01:57:40.96
So this one's going to sell out.

1573
01:57:40.96 --> 01:57:44.96
Plus we, it looks like we might have to have less seating depending on the COVID scenario.

1574
01:57:44.96 --> 01:57:47.96
So if you want to come come and sign up now.

1575
01:57:47.96 --> 01:57:53.96
And of course we have EF Overwatch executive leadership before your company.

1576
01:57:53.96 --> 01:57:55.96
That understand the principles that we're talking about.

1577
01:57:55.96 --> 01:57:58.96
People leaving the military whether retired or they're getting out.

1578
01:57:58.96 --> 01:58:02.96
These are experienced leaders that can come help you and your company.

1579
01:58:02.96 --> 01:58:04.96
Go to EF Overwatch.com.

1580
01:58:04.96 --> 01:58:07.96
And if you want to help service members active and retired.

1581
01:58:07.96 --> 01:58:09.96
Their families, their Gold Star families around the world,

1582
01:58:09.96 --> 01:58:12.96
then check out Mark Lee's mom.

1583
01:58:12.96 --> 01:58:17.96
Momally, she's got a charity organization called America's Mighty Warriors.

1584
01:58:17.96 --> 01:58:21.96
Go to America's Mighty Warriors.org to donate or get involved.

1585
01:58:21.96 --> 01:58:33.96
And if you need to hear more of my overburdened oration or you feel you need to absorb more of Ecos unbridled banter,

1586
01:58:33.96 --> 01:58:39.96
then you can find us on the in-a-webs on Twitter, on Instagram,

1587
01:58:39.96 --> 01:58:44.96
which is what Ecos, the Graham and Facebook.

1588
01:58:44.96 --> 01:58:53.96
Ecos adeclacharals and I am at Jocco-Willink and thanks to Colonel David Hackworth for writing this book.

1589
01:58:53.96 --> 01:59:06.96
But more important thanks to Colonel Hackworth for his service in sacrifice and for his dedication to our country and to his soldiers and to dedication that never wavered.

1590
01:59:06.96 --> 01:59:13.96
And the rest of the military personnel that are listening active duty, retired veterans.

1591
01:59:13.96 --> 01:59:20.96
Thank you for your dedication as well with a special dedication from Hack.

1592
01:59:20.96 --> 01:59:31.96
To all the doughboys, the ground pounders, the grunts, the American infantrymen, past, present and future, thanks to all of you.

1593
01:59:31.96 --> 01:59:40.96
And to the police and law enforcement and the firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers and Board of Patrol and Secret Service and to all the other first responders.

1594
01:59:40.96 --> 01:59:46.96
Thank you for your level of dedication that you also show to keep us safe here at home.

1595
01:59:46.96 --> 01:59:55.96
And to everyone else out there, let's remember that lesson from Henry C. DeBouer.

1596
01:59:55.96 --> 02:00:02.96
And I'm died on that frozen piece of Korea on February 6th, 1951.

1597
02:00:02.96 --> 02:00:13.96
The lesson is if you're taking care of yourself, if you're making yourself the priority, then you're a coward.

1598
02:00:13.96 --> 02:00:24.96
But if you take care of others, if you step up and do the right things for the right reasons, if you put the needs of others above yourself,

1599
02:00:24.96 --> 02:00:31.96
you will be a hero.

1600
02:00:31.96 --> 02:00:35.96
To go and be a relic.

1601
02:00:35.96 --> 02:00:39.96
Until next time, this is Echo and Jocco.

1602
02:00:39.96 --> 02:00:55.96
Out.
