00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.56 This is Jockel Podcast number 320 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willing. Good evening, I go. Good evening.
00:00:08.88 --> 00:00:17.20 So there's a a common set of metaphors that get thrown around a decent amount.
00:00:18.80 --> 00:00:27.60 Something along the lines of we as people were authors of our own book and where the star of our own
00:00:27.60 --> 00:00:38.16 movie. You heard these things before? I have. And when you hear them when I just set them and even the way I set them,
00:00:38.16 --> 00:00:45.04 they seem kind of tried and they seem cliched and I guess they are, but like many cliches, they are
00:00:46.16 --> 00:00:55.04 true in many ways. And there's an analogy in those statements with the idea of
00:00:55.04 --> 00:01:05.44 extreme ownership. Take ownership of your life. That's the similar to, hey, you write your own book.
00:01:08.48 --> 00:01:14.64 You get to create the plot is the underlying theme, which means that you have control. And obviously,
00:01:14.64 --> 00:01:24.88 I like that idea. I like that attitude. And I agree with the idea of creating your own plot,
00:01:24.88 --> 00:01:35.92 writing your own book that you're in. But it doesn't quite correlate 100% because
00:01:35.92 --> 00:01:45.36 here's the thing. If you are truly writing your own script, then you actually have control over everything.
00:01:46.64 --> 00:01:51.28 That's happening. You have 100% control over everything that you're writing. You're writing it.
00:01:52.96 --> 00:02:03.12 But in life, in real life, there are things that are beyond your control in war, the enemy gets a vote.
00:02:03.12 --> 00:02:16.64 In life, life gets a vote. Life gets a vote. Bad things are going to happen, the things that you
00:02:16.64 --> 00:02:25.36 don't expect. Disease, accidents, misfortunes, mishaps, catastrophes. And it doesn't matter,
00:02:26.56 --> 00:02:31.52 it doesn't matter who you are or what situation you are in. These things are going to impact your
00:02:31.52 --> 00:02:35.84 life. At some point, no one gets out of life without these things happening.
00:02:38.88 --> 00:02:46.32 No one truly gets to write their own script. So the question is, what do you do with these things when
00:02:46.32 --> 00:02:54.88 they hit you? How do you face these challenges? How do you actually take ownership of your life?
00:02:54.88 --> 00:03:06.08 It is not an easy thing to do. But we are lucky enough today to have someone here that
00:03:07.20 --> 00:03:12.48 has taken ownership of his life and is dedicated his life to service.
00:03:13.76 --> 00:03:20.80 He served in the sealed teams. Once he got out of the sealed teams, created an incredibly
00:03:20.80 --> 00:03:26.000 successful business, he serves his family, serves his wife and his two daughters. He serves his
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:37.52 faith. And now he is looking to serve his country again as a political leader. His name is Eli
00:03:37.52 --> 00:03:45.84 Crane and he is here tonight to share his experiences and pass on some of those lessons learned
00:03:45.84 --> 00:03:52.40 that he got along the way. Eli Crane, thanks for coming down, man. Thanks for having me, Jaco.
00:03:52.40 --> 00:03:56.96 Appreciate it. Long drive out from Arizona. I know about five and a half hours, but it was a good one.
00:03:59.36 --> 00:04:03.60 Let's jump into this. So speaking of Arizona, let's start at the beginning. Let's start about your
00:04:03.60 --> 00:04:11.20 past and where you came from. Yeah, I actually was born in Tucson, Arizona. My dad was going to
00:04:11.20 --> 00:04:18.32 pharmacy school out there. Both my parents are from Iowa and they moved out here. Go to a good
00:04:18.32 --> 00:04:23.92 pharmacy school and there were a lot of pharmacy jobs in the west. So my dad went through pharmacy
00:04:23.92 --> 00:04:30.16 school and moved to Stown to Yuma, Arizona, of all places. Yeah. And so was there a job or something
00:04:30.16 --> 00:04:36.72 down there? That's why that's why I did it. And it's cool because I remember a lot of my buddies
00:04:36.72 --> 00:04:42.08 in the platoon were always complaining about Iraq and I was like, this is like where I'm from.
00:04:42.08 --> 00:04:47.52 Man, except Arabic street signs and maybe an extra dust storm here there. This is like,
00:04:47.52 --> 00:04:54.000 kind of like Yuma without the good Mexican food. But yeah, so grew up in grew up in Yuma and
00:04:55.28 --> 00:05:01.68 just love playing sports was a football player. Played a little bit of basketball and stuff like
00:05:01.68 --> 00:05:07.68 that wanted to be a pro football player but then I realized you know, ran into reality and realized
00:05:07.68 --> 00:05:14.000 that I didn't have the skills and started looking at other options. Was your, Sir, your dad was
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.84 actually completed pharmacy school and he was a pharmacist? Yes sir. And what about your mom?
00:05:17.84 --> 00:05:23.20 Was she doing the same thing or did you start raising the kids or? Yeah, she was raising the kids and
00:05:23.20 --> 00:05:27.76 she was also, she also did some part-time work at our church as a secretary. So.
00:05:27.76 --> 00:05:36.000 So you were spending time in church then when you were younger? Yeah, I did. How was the attention
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.48 span in school and whatnot? It was good student? No, it was a horrible state. It was funny. I remember,
00:05:43.76 --> 00:05:48.48 thank God, you know, Jaco, you talk about dynamic leadership sometimes are like hey,
00:05:48.48 --> 00:05:55.12 what works for this individual doesn't work for that individual. But it was interesting because I
00:05:55.12 --> 00:05:59.84 remember my mom, thank God, she, you know, tried to be dynamic and parenting me and my brothers
00:05:59.84 --> 00:06:05.20 because my older brother and younger brother were good students but me on the other hand, not so much.
00:06:05.20 --> 00:06:09.36 We either, you're the middle, right? I was a middle and they were, I remember my mom come and home
00:06:09.36 --> 00:06:16.16 from a parent teacher conference and she was like, you know, Ela has in the classroom but he's
00:06:16.16 --> 00:06:22.56 not really here and like I was always daydreaming. I was out at recess, Jason Butterfly's
00:06:22.56 --> 00:06:28.24 whatever I was doing. But yeah, it didn't, and it was interesting because as I went down that
00:06:28.24 --> 00:06:33.52 pipeline, you know, I started to think, you know, people would tell me, like, especially my brothers,
00:06:33.52 --> 00:06:38.16 you know, you always raise your brothers, give each other hard time and my brothers, you know,
00:06:38.88 --> 00:06:46.16 I probably dished out more than I, than I received, but you know, they would tell me that I was stupid
00:06:46.16 --> 00:06:51.36 because my grades were awful. And so you hear, you hear something enough time, your stupid, your
00:06:51.36 --> 00:06:56.08 stupid, your stupid, you start to internalize it and, you know, you can easily make that a part of
00:06:56.08 --> 00:07:02.64 your identity. So I did, and, you know, I started to think I was stupid. And then as I got,
00:07:02.64 --> 00:07:08.24 as I got further along in life and I started, you know, finding what I was passionate about.
00:07:08.24 --> 00:07:14.000 I realized that I wasn't stupid. I just, you know, needed to have that energy and my attention
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.20 funneled in the right direction towards something that I really cared about. So you played,
00:07:19.20 --> 00:07:25.20 did football, did you say football and what? You know, I played football a little bit of basketball,
00:07:25.20 --> 00:07:30.000 but most of my focus was football. Yeah, and you played all through high school? Yeah. How good were
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.16 you? You know, I was decent, but I wasn't, I wasn't good enough to move on to college. I played,
00:07:38.16 --> 00:07:44.88 you know, I played quarterback. I loved, you know, playing quarterback. I loved the team dynamics of
00:07:44.88 --> 00:07:52.88 football, but it was interesting. And, you know, I got to take extreme ownership of this, but my coach,
00:07:52.88 --> 00:07:58.80 we had like three slow white quarterbacks and in high school, our coaches decided to switch us to an
00:07:58.80 --> 00:08:04.56 option, you know, running football team. So it was kind of like, you know, none of us were even
00:08:04.56 --> 00:08:11.28 really in a system that, you know, really highlighted our skills, our preferred skill sets or what
00:08:11.28 --> 00:08:18.64 we were even good at. But, um, and there was, there was one guy that ended up starting over me.
00:08:18.64 --> 00:08:24.64 And, uh, unfortunately, he was juicing at the time. And I was like a scrawny, like hundreds, you know,
00:08:24.64 --> 00:08:31.52 I wasn't that fortunate for him. He was like, I was six one, like 170 pounds, just really,
00:08:31.52 --> 00:08:36.000 really scrawny. He hadn't put on any weight yet. And, uh, he had, he kept throw about 15 yards
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.44 further than me. And he, he got, he, he started. So it is what it is, didn't get, you know, didn't,
00:08:42.40 --> 00:08:47.28 didn't get the opportunity to really start once I got deeper. I started all the way up to
00:08:47.28 --> 00:08:52.72 like my junior year and then, you know, I got benched. And, um, the bottom line is, you know,
00:08:52.72 --> 00:08:57.76 I wasn't good enough to make it happen. And I'm kind of looking back on it, hindsight being what it is.
00:08:57.76 --> 00:09:02.72 I'm kind of glad because I'm pretty pretty thrilled about the route that I ended up going down.
00:09:02.72 --> 00:09:08.24 And then you, you stayed in Yuma, that where you went to high school?
00:09:08.24 --> 00:09:10.48 Yeah, that's where I went to high school, civil high school.
00:09:11.28 --> 00:09:18.56 And your parents were just continuing to work and, yeah, get you ready for life?
00:09:18.56 --> 00:09:25.28 Yep, pretty much just raising me and my two brothers and, um, yeah, I mean, you know,
00:09:25.28 --> 00:09:29.92 I'm, feel pretty fortunate to grow up in the home that I did, you know, my parents loved us,
00:09:29.92 --> 00:09:36.16 they provided for us, et cetera. And, um, you know, I, I realized a lot of folks don't get that.
00:09:36.16 --> 00:09:40.72 So, pretty grateful for that. And then were you planning to go to college?
00:09:41.52 --> 00:09:42.64 Was that part of your plan?
00:09:42.64 --> 00:09:47.36 Yeah, I, I was planning to go to college, but I was hoping that I could go there and play football.
00:09:47.36 --> 00:09:55.20 Like that was my focus, that was my goal. And, uh, and then I also wanted to be in the military at some point.
00:09:55.20 --> 00:10:00.40 And so the advice that I was getting was, hey, if you're going to go to college, you know,
00:10:00.40 --> 00:10:04.40 or if you're going to go into the military, go through, go through school, get your degree,
00:10:04.40 --> 00:10:09.68 become an officer, you know, and you'll get a lead man, the pays better, et cetera.
00:10:09.68 --> 00:10:16.64 And, you know, that wasn't the path I ended up taking, but, um, did you, did you get better grades?
00:10:16.64 --> 00:10:22.08 Did you got older or did you did your brother scar you to the point where you heard to the,
00:10:22.08 --> 00:10:28.40 not doing any school or you at all? No, so when I got out of, uh, when I got out of high school,
00:10:28.40 --> 00:10:33.44 I started working some like odd jobs like construction, you know, at one point I was like a
00:10:33.44 --> 00:10:38.88 scorekeeper down at Parks and Rec, you know, for like softball games, stuff like that.
00:10:38.88 --> 00:10:43.92 I was working at a restaurant as like a bus boy, you know, definitely not on the, on the path to
00:10:43.92 --> 00:10:46.80 this. This is when you got out of high school. Yeah, when I got out of high school,
00:10:46.80 --> 00:10:51.36 did you didn't go right into college? I didn't. Okay. And then, uh, and then,
00:10:51.36 --> 00:10:55.20 I was kind of, I was kind of lost and it was right after my parents divorced, and my parents
00:10:55.20 --> 00:11:00.96 divorced was pretty tough. And so it kind of rocked my world. I was definitely, you know, a little bit
00:11:00.96 --> 00:11:07.28 rattled. So I was trying to figure how old were your parents got divorced? I was 17. So, um, you know,
00:11:07.28 --> 00:11:13.28 thankfully, like I said, I got my parents together for most of my, you know, upbringing, but it was,
00:11:13.28 --> 00:11:18.80 it was a pretty brutal divorce. And so it just really rocked my world and, um, I was, you know,
00:11:18.80 --> 00:11:25.20 took some time trying to figure out who the hell I was, what I was going to do. And, um, and then I started,
00:11:25.20 --> 00:11:31.36 I, I started going back to a community college called Arizona Western, and I started studying
00:11:31.36 --> 00:11:36.40 criminology. And that's when I started getting good grades because I, I loved it and, I loved it.
00:11:36.40 --> 00:11:41.12 And, you know, I was, I wasn't getting straight as, but I think, I had like a three, three, five
00:11:41.12 --> 00:11:47.84 average or something like that. And, uh, you know, I enjoyed it. And I longed that last four.
00:11:47.84 --> 00:11:54.80 So I did that for about two years. I think I was one credit away, like a, a elective away from getting my,
00:11:55.60 --> 00:11:58.96 my associate's degree. And then I applied to go to the University of Arizona.
00:11:59.60 --> 00:12:04.72 Unfortunately, when I got to the University of Arizona, they didn't have like a criminology degree.
00:12:04.72 --> 00:12:10.08 They had like a, some criminal justice degree, but I'd have to go to the L. or Business School,
00:12:10.08 --> 00:12:14.000 and I didn't get into that one. You had to have really good grades to get into it.
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.40 And, uh, and so I ended up being like, okay, I still want to finish my degree. Still
00:12:20.40 --> 00:12:24.72 want to have the opportunity to become an officer if possible. And so I was like, okay,
00:12:25.52 --> 00:12:32.48 being the typical, you know, I was like, okay, what's what path can I go that allows me to do that?
00:12:32.48 --> 00:12:38.08 And so I looked at sociology, the study of society and culture. And I started, uh,
00:12:38.64 --> 00:12:43.52 you know, working on my major and that I switched my major at that point because it's because they
00:12:43.52 --> 00:12:48.40 didn't have the criminology major. Were you thinking about the seal teams or were you just
00:12:48.40 --> 00:12:53.60 thinking about the military in general? Did you know? Yeah. So at that point, I knew I wanted to be a seal.
00:12:55.28 --> 00:13:00.80 Even when I was back in UMB before I came to Tucson, I was never a big part of your or anything
00:13:00.80 --> 00:13:05.60 like that. And I remember, um, when I was even when I was doing the odd jobs, one of my favorite
00:13:05.60 --> 00:13:11.68 things to do at night was to go to Barnes and Noble and just like, you know, really go through
00:13:11.68 --> 00:13:17.52 the military history section that they have there. And I would just read books on special forces,
00:13:17.52 --> 00:13:25.36 PJs, Rangers, Delta. And I just fascinated by the special forces community. And I remember my dad
00:13:25.36 --> 00:13:30.56 gave me a piece of advice in high school. He said, Eli, the trick to being happy in your career is
00:13:30.56 --> 00:13:36.000 basically to pick something you would do for free. Don't, don't pick a career because of money.
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.68 It won't make you happy. And he told me, if I could, if I could go back and do it again, I wouldn't
00:13:41.68 --> 00:13:46.08 be a pharmacist. He said, I could have gone and, you know, you know, been a forest Ranger,
00:13:46.08 --> 00:13:50.32 something like that. I would, I would do that. And so I took that advice on board. And I was like,
00:13:50.32 --> 00:13:55.44 you know, man, I was reading the books. And I was like jumping out of airplanes, blowing stuff up,
00:13:55.44 --> 00:13:59.76 you know, shooting, you know, being with, you know, being in a team environment.
00:13:59.76 --> 00:14:06.40 Puedo, I do that for free for sure. And so I started setting my mind on special forces. Is there
00:14:06.40 --> 00:14:12.40 something that particularly narrowed it down to the seal teams? Yeah, because all the literature that I was
00:14:12.40 --> 00:14:17.60 almost almost all of it said that it was the toughest training in the department of defense.
00:14:18.32 --> 00:14:22.64 And I don't know. There was something about that that just appealed to me. Like, I wanted to test
00:14:22.64 --> 00:14:28.48 myself and see if I could, if I had what it took to, to make it through the toughest training in the
00:14:28.48 --> 00:14:37.44 world. And then I, I loved the water or I thought I did. Yeah. That, that, that, that notion gets tested.
00:14:37.44 --> 00:14:41.60 Yeah, those get tested. It picked up. How old were you when you were figuring all that out?
00:14:41.60 --> 00:14:48.32 Was that when you're already at the University of Arizona? Yeah. So it was even when I was, you know,
00:14:48.32 --> 00:14:52.48 definitely thinking about it, even when I was at Arizona Western, I was also thinking about
00:14:52.48 --> 00:14:57.52 what it'd be cool to be a fed, because I was studying criminology, you know, federal law enforcement,
00:14:57.52 --> 00:15:03.68 or something like that. And then as soon as I got to U of A, you know, I started studying
00:15:03.68 --> 00:15:10.16 sociology, which I really, I was back in that, I really don't like this that much. And I really,
00:15:10.16 --> 00:15:16.000 I could even see kind of the indoctrination within academia at that point. And I was like,
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.48 I'm really not on board with a lot of this extra curricular stuff that they're putting out here
00:15:20.48 --> 00:15:30.24 and kind of the bent that a lot of academia has. And so I started, I found a program in ROTC.
00:15:30.24 --> 00:15:34.80 I started, I realized, okay, there is an ROTC program here. There's a lot of military folks.
00:15:34.80 --> 00:15:41.52 Maybe I should go get hooked into that. And so I did. And I found that they had a Ranger Challenge
00:15:41.52 --> 00:15:46.16 program at U of A. And so I was like, oh, cool, man, I want to see if I can join and get into that.
00:15:46.16 --> 00:15:52.64 Maybe I could learn a little bit and, you know, network and just figure out, start working towards
00:15:52.64 --> 00:15:57.68 getting in the right type of shape. And so I started doing the Ranger Challenge program and,
00:15:57.68 --> 00:16:02.16 you know, we'd have to, you know, wake up, do early morning PT's and, you know, just get some
00:16:02.16 --> 00:16:07.84 exposure to that culture and the leaders within that culture. And so I started doing that.
00:16:08.56 --> 00:16:12.72 And that was helpful. So what year is this? So that would have been probably
00:16:12.72 --> 00:16:22.48 2000. So were you in college? You know, in September 11th came? I was. I was. I was just starting my
00:16:22.48 --> 00:16:27.60 senior year at the U of A. And I was doing that Ranger Challenge program. You know, my grades were
00:16:27.60 --> 00:16:35.12 decent. I was a lifeguard at the U of A. Rex Center and, and 9 11 happened. I just finished a
00:16:35.12 --> 00:16:41.04 Ranger Challenge workout early in the morning. Got my car turned on the radio and I was driving
00:16:41.04 --> 00:16:46.80 back to where I lived and it was all over the radio and I was like damn. I was actually in a
00:16:46.80 --> 00:16:52.64 agricultural fraternity called Alpha Gamma Roe at the time. So I drove home and I was like, I woke up
00:16:52.64 --> 00:16:56.08 all the guys who were still asleep and I was like, dude, you guys got to get out here and watch this.
00:16:56.08 --> 00:17:02.72 And so we all, we all got to watch it and everybody was just obviously stunned and surprised and
00:17:02.96 --> 00:17:10.40 pissed off at the same time. And so I remember wanting to join, you know, obviously I, I wanted to
00:17:10.40 --> 00:17:16.40 join the military and I remember, you know, taking a couple days to think about it, but I'm just like,
00:17:16.40 --> 00:17:22.40 I got to go, you know, and I remember calling my mom and my dad and telling him, hey, look, I've
00:17:22.40 --> 00:17:26.64 decided I'm going to go join the military. I'm going to drop out of school and join the military.
00:17:26.64 --> 00:17:31.28 Because I just really felt like, hey, there's never going to be a time like this, you know,
00:17:31.28 --> 00:17:38.96 where the nation needs the next crop to step up and serve. And so I actually dropped out that
00:17:38.96 --> 00:17:44.48 week when, you know, dropped out all my classes and then went down, started talking to the recruiter
00:17:44.48 --> 00:17:49.52 and playing those games with the recruiter. And then, with then probably, I think, seven or eight
00:17:49.52 --> 00:17:55.76 days, I was, we were driving up to Phoenix so that I could get on a plane and fly to Great Lakes and
00:17:55.76 --> 00:18:02.24 it was pretty quick. Dude, that's really quick. Yep. And was it like a Seal contract? Was it,
00:18:02.24 --> 00:18:07.44 what was it a Seal contract? Yeah. Was it called Diver? I don't think it. I don't think it.
00:18:07.44 --> 00:18:17.04 I did back in 1820. No, it wasn't called that. I can't remember what it was called, but they did
00:18:17.04 --> 00:18:24.24 guarantee me the opportunity to do a screen test and try out. Yeah, which is if you think about that,
00:18:24.24 --> 00:18:30.56 is the shallowest guarantee you could ever get to sign your life away. Right. Hey, here you
00:18:30.56 --> 00:18:38.000 sign this piece of paper for six years in the Navy and you will be guaranteed a chance to take a
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.20 street, screening test that might get you picked up for buds. Right. That's a slim offering.
00:18:43.20 --> 00:18:50.08 I know it. And you Rogered up. I did. I did. And, you know, I'm, I wouldn't look
00:18:50.08 --> 00:18:56.32 in back on it now. I don't think I would change it. Even though I never, I've still to this day,
00:18:56.32 --> 00:19:03.92 never finish my degree, you know, for a couple different reasons. But I think this, I think it was the
00:19:03.92 --> 00:19:08.16 right thing to do. And I'm glad that, you know, there were a lot, there were thousands of Americans that
00:19:08.16 --> 00:19:12.56 did do exactly that. Yeah, Tim Kennedy was saying that same thing. He went down to the recruiter
00:19:12.56 --> 00:19:17.60 like September 12th or whatever. Yep. And he said the line was around the building and everything.
00:19:18.32 --> 00:19:25.76 So you showed up to boot camp in Chicago? Yep. And was it, was it a shock to the system?
00:19:25.76 --> 00:19:32.16 Well, big time. Big time. Yeah. I don't know who doesn't get a shock when he showed the boot camp.
00:19:32.16 --> 00:19:40.96 Even Navy boot camp, which is, you know, relatively mild, I guess compared to, like, let's say,
00:19:40.96 --> 00:19:46.72 the Marine Corps boot camp. But just the immediate loss of all your personal freedom,
00:19:46.72 --> 00:19:51.36 right, personal space, it's kind of a, it's kind of a little bit of a shocker echo.
00:19:51.36 --> 00:19:58.80 Oh, I understand. And what were you going to be? So I, uh, back then, I mean, obviously your goal
00:19:58.80 --> 00:20:04.40 is to be a seal, but you had to take a rate, right? Yep. What, uh, Gunners Mate was a seal source
00:20:04.40 --> 00:20:08.56 rate at the time. I think they're only at five o'clock. So I mean, I was like Gunners Mate. Yeah,
00:20:08.56 --> 00:20:14.24 cool. That sounds awesome. So I, so I chose Gunners Mate. And, uh, thankfully, I chose a cool one,
00:20:14.24 --> 00:20:19.28 because I was going to spend some time in that rate. Yeah. Did you take the screening test?
00:20:19.28 --> 00:20:26.80 I did. You passed it? Not the first time. The second time. Yeah, man. This, you know, this is something
00:20:28.48 --> 00:20:37.04 even before. Or older you at this point? I am 20. I'm 21 years old. Okay. So, um, I didn't pass my
00:20:37.04 --> 00:20:42.56 first one. I passed, I passed the second one. Like I was running in like steel, the, you know,
00:20:42.56 --> 00:20:48.16 back when you had to run the screen test and like steel, towed boots, knee knockers. Yeah. And I had
00:20:48.16 --> 00:20:53.60 gotten some, what I would consider today probably some pretty bad gouge from a team guy, um,
00:20:53.60 --> 00:20:58.88 that I talked to because I didn't know any seals. And I, you know, but my recruiter, he was like,
00:20:58.88 --> 00:21:03.44 hey, man, there's some seals out at YPG. You'm approving around her at jump school. We can go talk
00:21:03.44 --> 00:21:07.68 to him if you want. And I was like, yes, I'd love to go talk to him. So I remember going out,
00:21:07.68 --> 00:21:12.64 he drove me out there and I talked to one. And, uh, he was like, he's like, look, man,
00:21:13.52 --> 00:21:17.44 the only way you're going to know is if you, if you have what it takes, it's just a show up and
00:21:17.44 --> 00:21:21.44 do it. He's like, can you pass the screen test? And I was like, yeah, I think I can't. And so,
00:21:23.04 --> 00:21:28.000 that is, that is the worst advice ever. So that's what I was rolling on. Like this guy is a
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.36 Navy seal dude. This is what he told me. So, um, and then, so I, you know, once I got to the level
00:21:33.36 --> 00:21:38.32 where, you know, I could do like, I could pass the screen test. I was like, okay, I'm good to go.
00:21:38.32 --> 00:21:44.08 Let's do it. And then when I got, like, I was, but even when I ran the screen test on my own,
00:21:44.08 --> 00:21:50.16 I was never running in and still towed boots and pants and I don't, and like a fool,
00:21:51.04 --> 00:21:55.28 when I did, when I did this stuff, I didn't, I didn't do it together. And that's a big deal.
00:21:55.28 --> 00:22:00.56 There are a lot of people don't, like, people don't, yeah, dude, I can do 42 pushups. Yeah, I can do
00:22:01.12 --> 00:22:06.08 I can do six pull-ups. I can, I can do all these things individually, but you're not running
00:22:06.08 --> 00:22:11.36 them together. And when you start running them together with, with the time, um, requirements in
00:22:11.36 --> 00:22:18.32 between, it'll gas you pretty quick. So, the first time I ran it, man, I was dry heaving,
00:22:18.32 --> 00:22:23.60 coming across the finish line and, uh, failed. But I got a chance to go back and do it again.
00:22:23.60 --> 00:22:29.60 The next time, like, I came in with, like, maybe a second left. And, uh, they're like, all right,
00:22:29.60 --> 00:22:35.84 sweet, you get your silk contract, and I'm like, yes. And so, um, graduated from boot camp,
00:22:35.84 --> 00:22:41.20 went to Gunners made a school right there in Great Lakes. And at that point, they let us work
00:22:41.20 --> 00:22:46.24 out with some actual seals. We got to do CLPT, I think three times a week. So I started doing that.
00:22:46.88 --> 00:22:51.84 And it was kind of funny. I had, I have hairy legs. And so, there was this instructor.
00:22:51.84 --> 00:23:00.32 You would Joe Biden apparently. Wow. Wow. He's, I didn't realize. You see that video, right?
00:23:00.32 --> 00:23:06.16 I mean, is there a crazier, like, no combination of randomness that you could put into a video
00:23:06.16 --> 00:23:12.24 besides that Joe Biden and hairy legs and the kids in the blonde hair and the white. The most
00:23:12.64 --> 00:23:19.04 insane thing. Yeah, so anyways. So you got hairy legs. Yeah. And so one of the instructors,
00:23:19.04 --> 00:23:24.08 the name was instructor hater. He, he wouldn't even let me speak English. He made me speak in
00:23:24.08 --> 00:23:30.96 bookie. Like, and I used to be real good at doing the truth. But it was like, no, like, he made me
00:23:30.96 --> 00:23:35.60 run around and like, you know, go report to so and so over there. I would run up to him and I,
00:23:35.60 --> 00:23:42.64 he'd make me report like that and it, they loved it. But whatever. And yeah, so did the CLPT
00:23:42.64 --> 00:23:49.68 thing graduate graduated, Gunners made a school and then went immediately to Buds in class
00:23:49.68 --> 00:23:58.32 up with Buds class 242. Would you get what you expected at Buds? Yeah, and more and more. And,
00:23:58.32 --> 00:24:06.16 you know, it was, it was really, it was really interesting because I actually made it through
00:24:06.16 --> 00:24:13.76 how weak on my first, on my first attempt. And, you know, definitely not heroic, more like hanging
00:24:13.76 --> 00:24:22.32 on by the, you know, hanging on. What would you have a trouble with? So, yeah, yeah, I was, I was
00:24:22.32 --> 00:24:29.44 having trouble with Buds. So, when I was born, I was born with some doctor say that I had asthma,
00:24:29.44 --> 00:24:35.20 some said I had exercising due sprungitis, whichever diagnosis is correct at the end of the day,
00:24:35.76 --> 00:24:40.96 my lungs only functioned at about 60 percent and that, you know, of what they're supposed to. And that's
00:24:40.96 --> 00:24:47.28 after even like an albuterahit or treatment. And so, you know, you can imagine, you know, if your lungs
00:24:47.28 --> 00:24:52.96 are only functioning at 60 percent and you've trained to the bare minimum, you're going to have
00:24:52.96 --> 00:25:00.72 a tough time. And so, I was having a really tough time. And so, I made it, and I, I walk around
00:25:00.72 --> 00:25:07.60 it about 225 pounds. I had because my lungs don't function at the level they're supposed to,
00:25:07.60 --> 00:25:13.12 I had to get down to a hundred and seventy five pounds just the past of screen tests, right?
00:25:13.12 --> 00:25:18.72 It's like a car, right? We can't put a bigger engine in this thing, you know, we can't do a lot to it.
00:25:18.72 --> 00:25:22.24 How how do we make it? We start stripping weight out of it, throw the back seat, you know,
00:25:22.24 --> 00:25:26.08 like get rid of weight. Because just saying it is only going to go as fast as it goes. And so,
00:25:27.36 --> 00:25:33.12 started really, you know, getting really thin, really thin, and that, that, this is while you're in Buds
00:25:33.12 --> 00:25:37.84 or I had to get, I had to get really thin before you can go into Buds just because, you know,
00:25:37.84 --> 00:25:42.000 was this while you were at GMA school? Yeah. So while you're GMA school, you're just dropping weight.
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.64 Yep. Trying to get, trying to get the run faster. Yep. And you show up at Buds
00:25:47.92 --> 00:25:52.48 in your herd. Yeah, and it wasn't, honestly, it wasn't just that. It wasn't just that. Like,
00:25:52.48 --> 00:26:00.08 I was immature as well. You know, I had, that's one thing that, like, when I talked to people about
00:26:00.08 --> 00:26:05.04 seal training in Buds and the fact that they're trying to form you into a team guy,
00:26:07.04 --> 00:26:11.92 when I first showed up, I was immature and I was like, I was looking out for number one. I was
00:26:11.92 --> 00:26:18.24 looking out for me. I was like, man, and it wasn't like I was a jerk, but if, if I'm struggling,
00:26:18.24 --> 00:26:23.20 if I'm on the struggle bus over here, and I haven't grown up in maturity yet, I'm like, man,
00:26:23.20 --> 00:26:28.08 I got to, I gotta focus on myself. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna volunteer for that to spot
00:26:28.08 --> 00:26:36.16 under the boat, man. I'm hurting, right? And so, after post-heal week, I failed a,
00:26:36.16 --> 00:26:40.96 evolution called life saving, which sometimes is a passer fail, sometimes it's a weed out
00:26:40.96 --> 00:26:48.96 evolution. And so life saving just for people to understand, this is where the students have to
00:26:48.96 --> 00:26:54.72 rescue the instructors who are allegedly drowning, and they're actually not drowning. They're actually
00:26:54.72 --> 00:27:00.08 just getting ready to kick your ass. So, and they have different levels. The first one is kind of
00:27:00.08 --> 00:27:06.72 passive, and then it goes up those to the fifth level, which is you're in a fight with another
00:27:06.72 --> 00:27:15.04 dude in the water. And you mentioned that it's past fail, but you also mentioned that there's a decent
00:27:15.04 --> 00:27:20.80 amount of subjectivity to it, where if you have a guy that's coming through buds that maybe he's
00:27:20.80 --> 00:27:26.24 meeting the standards, he might even be crushing the standards, but he's not a good, doesn't appear
00:27:26.24 --> 00:27:30.24 like he's gonna be a good teammate. Doesn't it? Doesn't appear to be the kind of guy you'd want
00:27:30.24 --> 00:27:37.04 your platoon as an instructor? Yep. They can weed that guy out. Yep, at least that's the way it used to be.
00:27:37.04 --> 00:27:44.32 Yep. And that's what it was. And it's, I'm glad. I, you know, I look back on it. It's one of the
00:27:44.32 --> 00:27:50.40 best things that ever happened to me. You know, I got, I failed that event. They gave you like in most
00:27:50.40 --> 00:27:54.88 evolutions of buzz. It'll give you like two or three chances to pass it. I failed it three times.
00:27:54.88 --> 00:27:59.12 So they sent me to an academic review board. When you were, when you were failing that,
00:27:59.92 --> 00:28:06.56 was that just like horrifying? I can only imagine that failing life saving would be, yeah,
00:28:06.56 --> 00:28:12.24 kind of like drowning. Yeah. Yeah. You know, it was horrifying. Like I remember,
00:28:13.28 --> 00:28:18.80 we had one instructor who was a very large man, very large man. I remember getting him back to the
00:28:18.80 --> 00:28:24.72 pool wall, pinning his hands on the side and I was just smoked. And I got up on the pool deck and I'm
00:28:24.72 --> 00:28:29.28 still holding his hands on the pool wall so that, you know, he doesn't, because he'll just, he'll just
00:28:29.28 --> 00:28:35.04 fall into the pool if you don't, if you don't pin him to the wall. And so I'm pin him to the wall. I get up.
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.76 I get out of the pool deck and like I'm supposed to like cross his hands as I bring him up. You know,
00:28:41.76 --> 00:28:45.84 you don't want to talk about it. So he can like spin the other way. So he can spin with his back
00:28:45.84 --> 00:28:51.04 towards me and then I can put him put him on my legs and slowly let him down. So if he was a
00:28:51.04 --> 00:28:56.56 real drowning victim, I'm not creating more trauma. And I remember I spun him the wrong way and
00:28:56.56 --> 00:29:02.40 his junk like landing right on the pool deck and I heard him go, and this, he was his biggest
00:29:02.40 --> 00:29:10.88 doctor and I'm like 170 pound bud student. On my third try and I'm like, oh my god, I'm done.
00:29:10.88 --> 00:29:17.04 And went to an academic review board and yeah, they were, I remember walking in and they were like,
00:29:17.04 --> 00:29:21.68 all right young man, we're looked over your record and this is post-held week. This is post-held
00:29:21.68 --> 00:29:28.32 week. Meet yeah, me and my roommate were both dead. I think we both got boarded that day with one
00:29:28.32 --> 00:29:35.04 other guy and they were like, look, you're obviously tough. You made it through how weak, but we need the
00:29:35.04 --> 00:29:40.000 best of the best here and you're not meeting up to that standard. They were like, you fell to run,
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.000 you fell to swim, you fell to no course and here is the big, here is the big one and you're
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.76 at you're ranked in the bottom 25% of your class because in sealed training even back then we were
00:29:51.76 --> 00:29:56.72 doing peer e-vails. And so that's a big deal. And so they're like, we're going to recommend that
00:29:56.72 --> 00:30:03.52 you come back in a year and I was like, okay. And so you know, that was a tough, tough blow for
00:30:03.52 --> 00:30:08.48 me because they actually ended up keeping my roommate who had basically the same stats that I had
00:30:08.48 --> 00:30:13.36 was ranked the same the same way. So that was the keypim, you know. Honestly, I don't know,
00:30:13.36 --> 00:30:21.04 but they didn't tell me, but he actually made it all the way to third phase, couldn't pass this final
00:30:21.04 --> 00:30:29.60 swim and he got, he got booted and he was a, he was a little dude as well, but I felt really bad for him
00:30:29.60 --> 00:30:35.60 because he never went back. When you were going through hell week, what, were you solid and how
00:30:35.60 --> 00:30:44.48 week in terms of mentally? You know, I would say, I wouldn't say solid, I would say my mentality was
00:30:44.48 --> 00:30:49.36 hanging on for dear life. And I think that was, you know, the difference between my first
00:30:49.36 --> 00:30:55.76 how weak and my second how weak. If I say hanging on for dear life, you mean you're sitting in the
00:30:55.76 --> 00:31:02.000 water on Tuesday night and you're like, like, can we get a little bit further and you just did that
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:09.44 the whole time, basically? Yeah. So the interesting thing is, is that I never thought about quitting.
00:31:10.16 --> 00:31:18.32 However, I remember we broke out Sunday night and then Monday night, I remember standing in line
00:31:18.32 --> 00:31:23.04 with, you know, the class, you know, where they're coming around with flashlights looking at you
00:31:23.04 --> 00:31:28.40 and I'm thinking of myself. I've never been this cold. I've never been this wet. Never been this tired.
00:31:28.40 --> 00:31:34.88 This is not Monday night. This 24 hours in and I've still got another four and a half days of this.
00:31:34.88 --> 00:31:40.000 No, and I'm certain I think of myself. There's no way. And what I was trying to do is, I was trying
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000 to eat that elephant in, you know, in one bite. And I mean, that's, I think that's probably the
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.56 thing that gets most guys in training is that like when you've got a five and a half day block
00:31:52.56 --> 00:31:58.56 like that and you try and eat it in one bite, it's just mentally overwhelming. No, but if you're able
00:31:58.56 --> 00:32:02.40 to break it up into, I'm not even going to worry about Friday afternoon. I'm just going to focus
00:32:02.40 --> 00:32:07.84 on, I know I get to eat chow in two hours. I'm just going to, I'm going to make it to chow. And if it
00:32:07.84 --> 00:32:11.76 gets tougher than that, I'm just going to make it through this race. And if it gets tougher than
00:32:11.76 --> 00:32:15.44 that, I'm just going to put my right foot in front of my left foot and from, and you just break
00:32:15.44 --> 00:32:21.44 those goals down. And that, that was something that you, you think you're decent at doing until
00:32:21.44 --> 00:32:27.44 you get into the eye of that storm and you're like, that was a big difference between how we
00:32:27.44 --> 00:32:34.56 go on and how we do for me. But I, I bottom line is extreme ownership. I got what I deserved
00:32:34.56 --> 00:32:42.48 and it ended up being a blessing. How, were you not just super freaking angry when you got dropped?
00:32:42.48 --> 00:32:50.80 I was, I was, I remember, you know, you probably know, uh, Dan Taver. So I remember talking to
00:32:50.80 --> 00:32:56.24 instructor Taver at the time. He was, he was there in my board. He was the proctor in my class.
00:32:56.24 --> 00:33:00.000 And, you know, he pulled me aside. And it was really cool because he didn't have to do this. But
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.88 he was just really encouraging. He was like, hey, don't, don't let this, he said something in
00:33:04.88 --> 00:33:11.36 effect. I don't let this be the end. Come back. Do it. You can make it. And he's like, and he's like,
00:33:11.36 --> 00:33:18.16 and don't, basically, he's like, um, don't feel bad about this. Just make it right. And that was
00:33:18.16 --> 00:33:22.96 really cool coming from a guy like that. Who at that point in my life, I don't even know if, you know,
00:33:22.96 --> 00:33:27.44 he, you know, cared about it. Because, you know, the persona that buzz instructors put on. But it was
00:33:27.44 --> 00:33:31.28 just really cool. It was like, it was like an older dude who'd been there done that, sealed chief,
00:33:32.08 --> 00:33:35.52 and just a mentorship moment. And that that was really cool that he did that.
00:33:36.72 --> 00:33:41.52 So then it's trick or treat to the fleet. Yep. Give me something good to sweep. Oh, yeah.
00:33:41.52 --> 00:33:46.96 Where'd you get stationed? So the, the detailer gave me, hey, your options are you go to Japan,
00:33:46.96 --> 00:33:53.28 or you can go to Virginia, or you can go to Jacksonville, Florida. And so Japan sounded kind of cool,
00:33:53.28 --> 00:33:57.92 but I was worried that if I went there, it'd be harder to get back. And so, and I really didn't
00:33:57.92 --> 00:34:01.44 want to go to Virginia because I heard a lot of bad things about being in the fleet. There's a lot
00:34:01.44 --> 00:34:06.000 colder. I was like, Florida's kind of nice. I mean, Rhonda Santas wasn't there at the time,
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.24 but I, I'd still heard good things. And so I was like, uh, I'll go to Florida. I'll go to Mapleort
00:34:12.24 --> 00:34:19.12 and I remember Jaco, I drove, I drove across country and showed up there and I looked at that
00:34:19.12 --> 00:34:22.96 ship. And I was like, and I knew I was going to be sleeping on that ship for the next at least
00:34:22.96 --> 00:34:28.96 cup year or so. I actually slept in my car, man. I was like, oh my god, this is going to suck.
00:34:28.96 --> 00:34:35.60 And it did suck. What are you in E3 at this point? Yeah. So you check on board your ship.
00:34:35.60 --> 00:34:43.20 Did you get skullary duty out of the gate? Like, like, mass X. Yeah. No, I didn't, um, matter of fact,
00:34:43.20 --> 00:34:48.64 I got hooked up on that on that regard. I never went crank. We call it cranking. Yeah,
00:34:48.64 --> 00:34:54.40 that's cranking. Yeah. That's cranking. And, uh, my, my rotation didn't come up for probably
00:34:54.40 --> 00:34:58.96 until I'd been on the ship like a year or so. And instead of going cranking, I went and did
00:34:58.96 --> 00:35:04.96 something called the Hab team. And we were just rehabilitating spaces. It was the easiest duty
00:35:04.96 --> 00:35:12.08 I'd ever had on the ship. I worked for the, I worked for the post office clerk. And, uh, like,
00:35:12.08 --> 00:35:17.52 they would just pick a space or two every week. And we would just go in. We would tape off the space.
00:35:17.52 --> 00:35:21.92 We would tape off everything that couldn't get painted. And we would just paint it. And other than that,
00:35:21.92 --> 00:35:26.64 like, that's all we had to do. And they pulled me out of my division. So I didn't have to do any of
00:35:26.64 --> 00:35:32.40 the divisional work. I wasn't standing watches. And it was like the, it was like the easiest duty I
00:35:32.40 --> 00:35:37.44 ever did. All my buddies that were, you know, and, and the gunners made division were so pissed off
00:35:37.44 --> 00:35:42.24 at me that couldn't believe that I was getting a good deal. So we had this little gym on board.
00:35:42.24 --> 00:35:46.64 It was probably the size of this room that no kidding. Maybe a little bit bigger.
00:35:47.04 --> 00:35:51.84 Well, what ship was it? It was the USS Gettysburg. It was an ages missile cruiser.
00:35:51.84 --> 00:35:59.52 CG64. And, uh, there were over, like 450 people on the ship echo. So there were two gyms about
00:35:59.52 --> 00:36:07.76 this size. 400. And they would close it down if like the ship was rolling too much. And so it was like,
00:36:07.76 --> 00:36:13.12 you would show up, hoping to get a workout in two treadmills. And then, you know, they were almost
00:36:13.12 --> 00:36:20.24 always busy. And the food you're eating is garbage. You know, and so it was like, not only that,
00:36:20.24 --> 00:36:26.56 but you would typically, underway, you would work your regular day. Like, let's just say, you know,
00:36:26.56 --> 00:36:32.40 six in the morning to five in the afternoon. And then every single night you would have to stand
00:36:32.40 --> 00:36:37.12 to watch. You would either have the eight to midnight or the ballast before as we called it,
00:36:37.12 --> 00:36:42.40 where the four to eight. And so your sleep was always interrupted. You were always getting treated like
00:36:42.40 --> 00:36:49.52 crap in the in the fleet. And, um, but it, again, it was good for me. It's what I needed to grow
00:36:49.52 --> 00:36:55.76 up. And even in those circumstances, I said that I was immature when I went through Buds the first time.
00:36:56.48 --> 00:37:03.92 And I still think I'm a little immature now. It's a progression. And, uh, but it was cool because
00:37:03.92 --> 00:37:09.68 I started, I started looking back on, okay, what did I do wrong? How do I make this? How do I make
00:37:09.68 --> 00:37:14.96 this right? How do I improve while I'm out here? And even in those circumstances, I think I wasn't
00:37:14.96 --> 00:37:19.68 under a boat anymore running with that heavy boat or, you know, I couldn't, I couldn't step up
00:37:19.68 --> 00:37:25.04 for my buddies in that circumstance. But there were times where we were all tired. Nobody wanted
00:37:25.04 --> 00:37:29.68 to take the watch or nobody wanted to take the trash out or nobody wanted to do this. And there were
00:37:29.68 --> 00:37:35.36 times where I could practice, you know, taking it, you know, taking one for the team. And that's,
00:37:35.36 --> 00:37:41.20 that was part of what I needed to do. And just learn how to be that guy. You know, when, um,
00:37:41.20 --> 00:37:48.16 when the team needed you. And so and just grow up a little bit. But so, so how long did you
00:37:48.16 --> 00:37:52.24 spend on that ship? Two and a half years. Did you do one deployment or two deployments? Two.
00:37:53.20 --> 00:37:59.84 They said that seal instructors and the recommendation on on my exit, Evalor, whatever it's called,
00:37:59.84 --> 00:38:06.80 was he like, we recommend he comes back in a year. But the seal of a ship won't get a replacement
00:38:06.80 --> 00:38:11.20 if they, if they let you go to a special program so that they were like, no, it's just, we're,
00:38:11.20 --> 00:38:16.000 we're, you're staying here. We can't be undermaned. And so at what point did you commit to like,
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.80 I'm going back above them and make it? So this is an interesting story. And it, it talks about,
00:38:23.52 --> 00:38:29.12 you know, it's all about taking, taking risk at times because Jocca, when,
00:38:29.12 --> 00:38:37.44 when my orders came through to go to Buds, I still had a year left on my contract. So I could
00:38:37.44 --> 00:38:44.32 agon the buds either past or failed. And then, you know, whatever, or if I failed, I could just get out.
00:38:44.32 --> 00:38:49.36 Yep. The Navy was like, nope. You're, you're going to read on this for another four years
00:38:49.36 --> 00:38:54.48 if you want those orders. They dropped that on me the day that I was scheduled to leave the ship. I was so
00:38:54.48 --> 00:38:59.28 pissed. And I was just like, I can't believe it because I'm face, I'm staring down the barrel.
00:38:59.28 --> 00:39:04.08 Because I, I used to get the four year mark now. I was at the three year mark. Okay. Oh, so your first
00:39:04.08 --> 00:39:08.40 enlistment was like three years because you didn't get through Buds. Well, it was, I had a four year
00:39:08.40 --> 00:39:13.60 enlistment, but when my orders came through, I was at my three year mark. Got it. So I had enough time
00:39:13.60 --> 00:39:18.96 on my contract where even if I went to Buds failed out, I could just get out. I'm out, clean, clean
00:39:18.96 --> 00:39:22.64 escape. Don't have to come back to the fleet. But the Navy was like, nope, you're signing a
00:39:22.64 --> 00:39:27.68 four. They knew they know that how much of leverage they have on kids that want to go back to
00:39:27.68 --> 00:39:32.88 seal training or do seal training or special program or whatever. And so like I remember calling
00:39:32.88 --> 00:39:36.000 some mentors in my life, I was like, hey man, this is what I'm staring at. What do you think?
00:39:36.80 --> 00:39:43.20 And I also, I was just praying. I was like, Lord, this is the only thing, this is the only thing
00:39:43.20 --> 00:39:47.60 on my heart. And I was even praying while I was underway on the Gettysburg. I was like, Lord,
00:39:47.60 --> 00:39:52.48 if this is not what you want me to do, please take it from me. Because I don't, I had, I
00:39:52.48 --> 00:39:56.56 want to walk in your favor. I want to, I want to be the man you want me to be. And I want to do what
00:39:56.56 --> 00:40:01.52 you want me to do. But this is the only thing on my heart. And so if it's not what you want me to
00:40:01.52 --> 00:40:07.60 do, please, like path me out of here, you know, send me down the path, whatever path you want me to
00:40:07.60 --> 00:40:13.76 go down. Because I'm a knucklehead. And if you don't help me and guide me and direct me in this,
00:40:13.76 --> 00:40:18.88 I'm going to probably make a bad decision. And so, but yeah, it was still, it was still,
00:40:18.88 --> 00:40:24.64 so the fire still burned, you know, to go back, even knowing that if I didn't make it, I was going
00:40:24.64 --> 00:40:30.16 to be right back in the fleet. So that's one of the hard things about the Navy, all you
00:40:30.16 --> 00:40:35.12 young men that listen to this show, you know, is it, at least in the Marines or in the Army, man,
00:40:35.12 --> 00:40:39.84 it's like, if you'll make it through a program, you can go being a conventional unit in fight,
00:40:39.84 --> 00:40:47.12 bro, you're going to be fighting some rust and some dust in the Navy for a polishing some brass,
00:40:47.12 --> 00:40:55.60 sweeper sweeper's man, man, your broom did. It's bad. And it must have been super hard to prepare now
00:40:55.60 --> 00:41:00.80 since you're on a ship underway to deployments in two years. You're eating food that sucks for
00:41:00.80 --> 00:41:06.72 your health. Chili dogs, baby. Chili dogs. How did you stay in shape or how did you get in shape?
00:41:08.80 --> 00:41:14.32 Once I got, once I knew that my orders, once I submitted my package, I went right back to
00:41:14.32 --> 00:41:19.20 a, I got a drop a bunch of weight. I got in a little bit stronger, put on a little bit more muscle,
00:41:19.92 --> 00:41:24.80 but I started dropping a weight again so that, you know, I could keep up on the runs and whatnot.
00:41:25.44 --> 00:41:32.16 Sometimes they'd let us run around the ship. Sometimes, you know, sometimes they wouldn't, but,
00:41:32.16 --> 00:41:38.16 you know, I just did any time I got the opportunity to work out, I did. And, you know, I was hoping
00:41:38.16 --> 00:41:46.08 that the increased maturity was really going to help me out a lot, but, you know, I just worked out
00:41:46.08 --> 00:41:51.28 whenever I can and I definitely don't feel like I was ready just because of what I came out of,
00:41:51.28 --> 00:41:56.48 but I was more ready mentally to, you know, go back and I think that was where my biggest,
00:41:57.04 --> 00:42:03.60 where my biggest issue was. And so you get back to buds easier this time or maybe not easier,
00:42:03.60 --> 00:42:09.20 but you're more mentally prepared. Yeah, it was, it was easier in the fact that I was mentally
00:42:09.20 --> 00:42:15.60 prepared and I knew, you know, I'd seen a lot of the movie already. The difference was,
00:42:16.16 --> 00:42:22.08 is that when I got back the second time right off the bat, I got pneumonia. And so I failed. So I already
00:42:22.08 --> 00:42:27.44 have horrible lungs and now I've gotten pneumonia, like just ravaging them. And so I failed my
00:42:27.44 --> 00:42:34.000 first two runs. And like so they were like, look, if you fail one more run, you're done, we're
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000 dropping you and I hadn't even got back to hell week. So I'm like, oh my god dude, I'm not even
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:46.80 going to get back to where I was where I made it to the first time. And so thank God, I passed my
00:42:46.80 --> 00:42:54.000 third run and got an opportunity going to hell week. And so thankfully, you know, I made it,
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.40 you know, passed that run, made it through hell week. And then, but I was on the bubble, the
00:42:58.40 --> 00:43:04.56 entire rest of seal training for runs. Yeah. And I was a horrible runner. Every time, like, came in,
00:43:04.56 --> 00:43:12.56 like, made, you know, four, three, two, you know, one second. Exactly. Exactly.
00:43:12.56 --> 00:43:18.16 Was hell week? Was it, was it better going through the first time when you didn't really know
00:43:18.16 --> 00:43:22.80 what to expect or the second time where you did know what to expect? Which one was better,
00:43:22.80 --> 00:43:30.64 which one was worse? For me, the second one was much better, just because I think that there's a
00:43:30.64 --> 00:43:35.36 lot of, you know, fear and anxiety going into something like that that you know has taken out
00:43:35.36 --> 00:43:41.12 so many men better than you or perceivably better than you and stronger than you and faster than
00:43:41.12 --> 00:43:45.44 you. And you can't argue with the data. I mean, so many guys don't make it through that.
00:43:45.44 --> 00:43:53.84 And so I knew I could make it through it. And I also knew there was a part of me that was like,
00:43:55.04 --> 00:44:01.12 I don't stay to wake for maybe 48 hours before going into hell week the first time. Maybe,
00:44:01.12 --> 00:44:07.12 probably not even that long. Probably like 30 something like that. And so there's a part of you that's
00:44:07.12 --> 00:44:11.92 like, if you've never done something, okay, how am I going to stay awake? How's the body even
00:44:11.92 --> 00:44:16.48 do that? Stay awake from five and a half days and just get destroyed the entire time? And so there's
00:44:16.48 --> 00:44:21.28 always that part of you that's like, okay, I know they can't kill me, but this just doesn't make a lot
00:44:21.28 --> 00:44:26.24 of sense. At the end of the day, I'm exhausted, I'm tired. What would, what would things look like if,
00:44:26.24 --> 00:44:31.84 if I didn't sleep for five, five and a half days? How would I function? How, so the fact that I
00:44:31.84 --> 00:44:36.72 had already done it and gone through it, I was like, I know I can do this. I know that, you know,
00:44:36.72 --> 00:44:40.88 one of the things that I like to tell people, this is how it felt for me was, you know how echo
00:44:40.88 --> 00:44:45.52 you always get like a, even today, you'll probably get a second win, you'll feel tired and then you'll
00:44:45.52 --> 00:44:51.60 get a second win. That's how I felt. I felt like every time like, you know, five, six, seven hours
00:44:51.60 --> 00:44:56.72 into, you know, into it, my, I'd get tired. I'd just wait an hour and then I'd get a second win and
00:44:56.72 --> 00:45:02.64 I'd be right back in it. And that's kind of cool that your body works that way, but they also said that
00:45:02.64 --> 00:45:08.72 your body will stop like shutting, it'll start shutting down functions that aren't necessary to
00:45:08.72 --> 00:45:14.40 survival like growing fingernails or facial hair. I don't know if that's true, but that's what they told us.
00:45:15.52 --> 00:45:21.04 Yeah, that's crazy. And, and then that's it. I mean, you, you, you, you make it through buds this second
00:45:21.04 --> 00:45:26.24 time, even though you're on the bubble the entire time for runs. Yeah. But you make it through.
00:45:28.56 --> 00:45:36.88 I make it through. And then, um, I'm told I get orders, still team three. Most of my class got
00:45:36.88 --> 00:45:41.84 orders to the East Coast. They're only six of us is stayed on the West Coast. Sure. How is one of the
00:45:41.84 --> 00:45:47.84 fortune once? So you get through it, you graduate and where'd you get orders to?
00:45:48.88 --> 00:45:54.48 Uh, still team three. And did that, the most your class get West Coast, these coasts, even split? How
00:45:54.48 --> 00:45:59.20 did, how did they do that? So only six of us stayed on the West Coast, everybody else went to the East
00:45:59.20 --> 00:46:05.52 Coast. So I was, I felt lucky. Dang. And where was team three at the time? What was going on?
00:46:05.52 --> 00:46:10.16 Team three was already deployed at the time. You got, you got this was those, this is Rommati.
00:46:10.16 --> 00:46:16.24 Oh, so yeah. So what they told us, Joco, is it, all right, team three is deployed. You
00:46:16.24 --> 00:46:20.40 guys are just going to stay here and go to schools. And so it was interesting because I had just
00:46:20.40 --> 00:46:26.000 married my wife in between buds and SKT. And so I'm like, this is awesome, babe. I'm just going to,
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.24 you know, hang out at the team and like, maybe, you know, sweep for a little bit and like,
00:46:30.24 --> 00:46:33.84 go to a school every once in a while. We can start our life together. So why don't you move out?
00:46:33.84 --> 00:46:37.84 She just graduated from our university of Arizona. Like, why don't you move out when we can
00:46:37.84 --> 00:46:45.20 start our marriage together? Did you run that grant through the US Navy? No, no. But, Chaco, the chief,
00:46:45.20 --> 00:46:49.28 in charge of us was like, now you guys are good to go. You're not deploying. We've, you know, we've
00:46:49.28 --> 00:46:55.60 talked it through a bubble, blah, blah. And so she moves out and we move into this little apartment here
00:46:55.60 --> 00:47:01.84 in Point Loma. And, and then two weeks later, they're like, hey, change of plans. You're deploying,
00:47:01.84 --> 00:47:05.92 and it's soon, you're, you're going to go through Searschool and then you're going to deploy.
00:47:06.88 --> 00:47:13.36 And so I don't remember what, what it was that happened. But for the guys went through Searschool the
00:47:13.36 --> 00:47:20.72 week before I did and then they deployed. And so I went through Searschool by myself and then to
00:47:20.72 --> 00:47:27.68 pull like flew over by myself on like a civilian airplane. And I'm just like, oh my, dude, I was so
00:47:27.68 --> 00:47:32.24 stressed out. First time going to war. Don't know any of the guys at Searschool Team 3,
00:47:32.24 --> 00:47:38.24 but my instructors have told us, hey, listen, you guys, when you get there, keep your mouth shut,
00:47:38.24 --> 00:47:43.04 do what you're told. You're about to swim with some great white sharks. That's, that's basically
00:47:43.04 --> 00:47:48.24 the advice. And so I don't know anybody. I'm flying the war by myself. I don't even have any guns.
00:47:48.88 --> 00:47:53.84 And it's just like, you don't know, I had nothing to compare to. I, I'd, I'd been, I'd been on a
00:47:53.84 --> 00:47:59.12 ship before, but I'm flying into a war zone with no guns. Like, I don't know what's going to,
00:47:59.12 --> 00:48:03.36 is the playing in a land is like, I'm going to have to PLF out of the plane because there's like,
00:48:03.36 --> 00:48:08.48 people shooting us like, I have no idea or no context for what that's going to look like. And then
00:48:08.48 --> 00:48:13.36 I'm going to have to like integrate into this platoon of guys that already did a work up together.
00:48:14.16 --> 00:48:22.000 And so anyway, we were what 30 minutes down the road from you guys in Bravo Platoon. I think there
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:28.08 were four or five of us, four of us that went to Bravo Platoon. And so we started immediately,
00:48:28.08 --> 00:48:33.36 you know, doing the new guy job, you know, making sure the hummers are gasped up, making sure
00:48:33.36 --> 00:48:37.92 they're clean, making sure the windows have all the moon dust wiped off. I'm making sure the
00:48:37.92 --> 00:48:43.44 two 40s and the 50s are clean, oiled up ready for the op. And then it was cool because they threw
00:48:43.44 --> 00:48:48.56 us in to turret gunning immediately. And I was like, this is fantastic, man. Because all of our
00:48:48.56 --> 00:48:52.96 buddies, you know, are doing whatever they're doing on the east coast and we're already getting
00:48:52.96 --> 00:48:58.88 to go on ops with these guys. Yeah, that's freaking awesome. And the culture was, and that
00:48:58.88 --> 00:49:06.08 platoon was really cool in that the rule was this. We're not messing with you unless we need to.
00:49:06.08 --> 00:49:11.92 And then if we need to, we're going to tighten you up. And you know, but it was just like as long
00:49:11.92 --> 00:49:17.52 as you, as long as you walk around on egg shells, do the new guy thing, you know, we'll leave
00:49:17.52 --> 00:49:22.56 you alone. But you're going to, you're going to do all the crappy jobs that nobody wants to do.
00:49:22.56 --> 00:49:28.72 You're going to do it standing tall with respect. And, you know, I was totally totally all about that.
00:49:28.72 --> 00:49:33.44 Things changed a little bit once I came into bruiser. They're very next.
00:49:33.44 --> 00:49:40.72 I try to think of how many guys came to task unit bruiser in Ramadi. You guys got, you
00:49:40.72 --> 00:49:47.44 guys got, sold the front. I know you got sal. And another dude named Sean. Okay. Sean H. Yeah.
00:49:47.44 --> 00:49:57.36 Yeah. Sal was, he was, he was such a nice guy. And he had, and he smiled all the time. This is the,
00:49:57.36 --> 00:50:03.92 this is the, this is the, this is the invention of normal face. So I had this thing I do with sal,
00:50:03.92 --> 00:50:11.28 where I, I'd taken the, the cardboard like, entered from the spools of paper that we'd print
00:50:11.28 --> 00:50:15.92 maps on. Yeah. And I'd sit there and I'd be like, all right, Sal, listen up, bro. You can't be,
00:50:15.92 --> 00:50:19.92 you're, you're like, supposed to be a seal now. You can't be having this big smile on your face.
00:50:19.92 --> 00:50:25.36 You look like a dork. We don't look like dorks. And of course, this is all like hilarious. So
00:50:25.36 --> 00:50:28.48 he's smiling even more. And I'm like, okay, so here's what we're going to do. You can't smile.
00:50:28.48 --> 00:50:31.36 If you smile, I'm going to whack you in the head with this thing. And, you know, so when
00:50:31.36 --> 00:50:35.52 I'd start going ready, then he'd be like, this is her. And I go, go. And he couldn't, he couldn't
00:50:35.52 --> 00:50:40.88 keep like a normal face for a half a second. I'd have to whack him in the head, but he was a
00:50:40.88 --> 00:50:45.92 freaking good guy, funny and just had a good attitude, but he just smiled a lot. And of course,
00:50:45.92 --> 00:50:50.08 whatever you're going to do, if you don't smile, you're going to get beat for not smiling. If you
00:50:50.08 --> 00:50:54.56 smile too much, you're going to beat for smiling too much. So you're going to get beat. I mean,
00:50:54.56 --> 00:51:00.32 that's basically what the whole concept was when you rolled out. When we, when we get to, when we
00:51:00.32 --> 00:51:08.40 get to it, remind me to tell you a funny, sad friend, a story that involved you in skits. Okay.
00:51:08.40 --> 00:51:15.28 Yeah, maybe it's too scary. It's too scary. That lost to been good. So you ended up, I mean,
00:51:15.28 --> 00:51:20.000 that's still even for Sal for you, for you guys to roll on, out on a deployment. You haven't even
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.68 done a work of before you guys get to go out. You guys get to do some ops, get some experience,
00:51:23.68 --> 00:51:28.000 get to know what it's like to drive down the road in the middle of night waiting to get
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:38.40 blown up, which is, which is fun. Then what? So then, then the deployment's over? Yeah, then
00:51:38.40 --> 00:51:46.48 the deployment's over. And I flew back on the last bird. And, and what, what, what, how
00:51:46.48 --> 00:51:51.52 did we run the same bird? If it was the last bird, we were on the last bird. I don't think so. I was
00:51:51.52 --> 00:52:00.08 relaxed, so he wasn't there. But yeah. So anyway, I get back, and it's weird because
00:52:01.36 --> 00:52:05.36 all the guys had already been back. They were already like selecting the new platoons. I was on
00:52:05.36 --> 00:52:12.64 the last bird, so I get in late. And then I remember, you know, getting back, me and my wife, we schedule
00:52:12.64 --> 00:52:17.76 our first like date night. Like we're going to finally get a go out and celebrate a hanging out,
00:52:17.76 --> 00:52:23.84 made it back, all that. And so I'm, we're, she's getting ready. I'm already ready to go like, you
00:52:23.84 --> 00:52:30.80 know, that that goes out of date nights. And I get a call from one of my other new guy, but he's
00:52:30.80 --> 00:52:35.04 that just came back with me, but he came back, I think, before me. And he's like, hey,
00:52:35.68 --> 00:52:40.80 you need to get down to Danny's right now. And I'm like, what? And he's like, yeah, bro,
00:52:40.80 --> 00:52:47.28 we're in Delta, Platoon now. Get down here right now. And I'm like, no, dude, I'm, I'm off.
00:52:47.28 --> 00:52:51.92 People going, he's like, Eli, I'm not asking me, I'm telling you, get your ass down to Danny's now.
00:52:52.48 --> 00:52:57.44 So I got to go tell my wife, like, hey, there's going to be no date night. I don't know what's
00:52:57.44 --> 00:53:03.44 going on, but it's sound serious. So I'm rolling down the world worth three is apparently broken out.
00:53:03.44 --> 00:53:09.36 There's a situation. It happens to be a bar in Coronado. Yeah. And so like, I jump in my little
00:53:09.36 --> 00:53:13.84 green Honda Civic and I drive over the barrage as fast as I can and without, you know, getting
00:53:13.84 --> 00:53:18.96 arrested and he's like, he's like, just when you get the Danny's come out behind the bar.
00:53:18.96 --> 00:53:22.32 I'm like, oh, this sounds fantastic. He's like, yeah, we're in Delta, Platoon,
00:53:22.32 --> 00:53:29.12 Chris cows are LPO. And I'm like, awesome. And so I get there. I walk through the bar, all the new
00:53:29.12 --> 00:53:35.12 guys that I just like graduated, you know, SQT with some of which went down, some of which didn't
00:53:35.12 --> 00:53:41.20 are now standing at attention in lines behind Danny, just getting screamed at. And I'm like,
00:53:41.20 --> 00:53:49.12 holy cow, dude. So yeah, that was, and so that night, you know, we were, you know, it was the
00:53:49.12 --> 00:53:58.16 end, end doctrine, end, end talking the tea bruiser, right? And so this guy, this guy, you know,
00:53:58.16 --> 00:54:03.84 he wasn't there, but it was just, yeah, it was, it was interesting because the culture had
00:54:03.84 --> 00:54:13.28 completely shifted to, hey, man, totally new, new group of dudes, new rules. And yeah, I realized
00:54:13.28 --> 00:54:19.76 real quick that this was going to be a interesting two years and you better be locked on.
00:54:19.76 --> 00:54:24.64 Like, we would come in, like, we would come in to rooms like the new guys like back to back,
00:54:24.64 --> 00:54:29.84 like, our hands ready to go because you didn't know what was, you didn't know what were
00:54:29.84 --> 00:54:36.32 you were going to be, get it with, but they definitely, they definitely loved having new guys around,
00:54:36.32 --> 00:54:39.76 I'll tell you that. Yeah, I guess that answers my question. I was going to ask you if you got
00:54:39.76 --> 00:54:44.48 treated like a new guy, since you kind of had a little bit of a deployment, I guess the answer is
00:54:44.48 --> 00:54:48.48 a solid, yes. Oh, yeah, they were like, yeah, that's like a little bit worse because they're like,
00:54:48.48 --> 00:54:52.32 you lucky bastard, you got to go over there and you didn't even do a workup. That was the thing,
00:54:52.32 --> 00:54:58.32 they're like, hey, that didn't count. You're doing a full workup. You will be a new guy for a full
00:54:58.32 --> 00:55:04.24 two years and it was like, Roger that. And you know, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right?
00:55:04.24 --> 00:55:10.08 So, talk it. Did you, uh, what position did you get in the platoon? We were a double.
00:55:10.08 --> 00:55:17.36 A double turret gunner. Yep. And it was, it was cool, but I, I like to talk about my failures,
00:55:17.36 --> 00:55:23.28 because I think that's where the gold off and is Chris actually sat down with each and every one of
00:55:23.28 --> 00:55:27.44 us with his like little green notebook and he's like, all right, tell me what, what your goals,
00:55:27.44 --> 00:55:31.36 what do you want to accomplish, what do you want to do? And I said, I want to become a sniper. And so,
00:55:33.12 --> 00:55:36.72 he actually, you know, and I think there were a couple other, but that was,
00:55:36.72 --> 00:55:40.48 of other guys that wanted to go to sniper school, but that was my number one thing. And so he actually
00:55:40.48 --> 00:55:47.04 sent me to sniper school. My first, as a new guy. Yeah. And I failed. Oh, no, man, I made it through
00:55:47.04 --> 00:55:56.08 pick and then scout and then I didn't qualify expert on the, the M4, the 200 yard
00:55:56.08 --> 00:56:01.28 quality you have to do before you actually get to go to sniper school. And so I was, that was hard,
00:56:02.48 --> 00:56:07.60 you know, imagine coming back and telling Chris, hey, I just blew that. And so they didn't get
00:56:07.60 --> 00:56:14.32 an extra billet because I failed. So Chris wasn't happy about that. It definitely went in the book of
00:56:14.32 --> 00:56:24.88 whoa. And yeah, so, you know, paid paid for that pretty dearly, but, you know, I mean, you know,
00:56:24.88 --> 00:56:32.000 it is what it is. Wasn't like I was, wasn't trying. Yeah, the people, I guess it's hard to,
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.04 it's hard to see from the public persona that got put out of Chris of like how funny he was and
00:56:37.04 --> 00:56:43.20 how like shit talking he was, it just like, and the other thing that sounds craziest, the
00:56:43.20 --> 00:56:50.16 prank, like he like to do like pranks on people like a little kid, you know. You did. That was when
00:56:50.16 --> 00:56:54.24 people asked me all the time, they're like, so what do you think of that movie? And I was like,
00:56:54.24 --> 00:56:58.64 you know, the movie is, you know, it's decent, whatever. But I was like the number one thing that they
00:56:58.64 --> 00:57:06.08 screwed up was like that they missed like how funny he was in his tensor humor and how he was
00:57:06.08 --> 00:57:12.96 always doing something shady. Always doing something shady. But I guess I don't, maybe it
00:57:12.96 --> 00:57:17.60 wouldn't, maybe Hollywood didn't think it'd be as cool of a movie as if, you know, they portrayed
00:57:17.60 --> 00:57:22.08 him that way. Yeah, I guess they would have had to make it into a, like a mini series or something
00:57:22.08 --> 00:57:27.04 where they could, where they could develop the character, develop his personality so you could
00:57:27.04 --> 00:57:32.24 see all sides, which would have made it more impactful because then you'd see, hey, this guy that
00:57:32.24 --> 00:57:40.08 is very funny loves his family and likes to clown around. I also can be totally serious and has a
00:57:40.08 --> 00:57:45.36 very, has the most serious job. But, you know, they got to take all that stuff and like you said,
00:57:45.36 --> 00:57:49.84 they got to make it into a movie that's now and a half long and that's what they did. Yeah, they took
00:57:49.84 --> 00:57:55.28 like 15, 20 years of his life and condensing it now and a half. So I mean, you know, that can't be
00:57:55.28 --> 00:58:01.60 easy to do. Yeah. How was that work up? Good. So I was, I was, I was running your work up.
00:58:01.60 --> 00:58:08.88 Yeah. Thank you, by the way. My God, did unbelievable. Do you carry any wounded guys anymore?
00:58:08.88 --> 00:58:17.36 Yeah. We actually, dude, it was so crazy. Like, you know, and it was cool to see you because you'd
00:58:17.36 --> 00:58:24.48 come out all the time. And I can't remember which one's, which years you were even out for, but
00:58:24.48 --> 00:58:33.12 it was, I do remember doing like, you know, seven click insert in, you know, hit the target and then
00:58:33.12 --> 00:58:40.80 on the way, ex-fill, this guy would put half of our guys down at least. So I mean, I would, you guys would
00:58:40.80 --> 00:58:49.20 you guys would get tore up by the hot for. All right. I think there might have been a little bit of a
00:58:49.20 --> 00:58:54.56 suggestion from this guy to make it as hard as humanly possible just by reading some of his stuff.
00:58:54.56 --> 00:58:59.92 And, but I, you know, it was interesting because like you would, you know, you do your op,
00:58:59.92 --> 00:59:05.52 you do your mission and then like you've got another, you know, click or two to ex-fill out and,
00:59:05.52 --> 00:59:11.92 you know, trade it's putting down over half of your guys. And so, you know, it's already, you've
00:59:11.92 --> 00:59:16.32 already got your body armor on, you've got like a machine gun, you've already got like, you know,
00:59:16.32 --> 00:59:23.68 you're loaded for bearer. And now you've got to carry, you know, another 250, maybe even depending
00:59:23.68 --> 00:59:28.64 on his size. We had some beasts in my pool too. And so, you know, maybe another 300 pound dude,
00:59:28.64 --> 00:59:34.56 and it was just like brutal. I remember, remember one time I was getting ready to pick up,
00:59:34.56 --> 00:59:42.16 want a down seal and it was chief D. And he's a big muscular dude, the type of guy that was,
00:59:42.16 --> 00:59:46.16 you did not want to piss off. And also, let's say like, he's not going to be super light.
00:59:46.96 --> 00:59:55.04 He is not super light. Yeah. He's, he's really heavy. And so, I am a freaking stud. He just want to be,
00:59:55.04 --> 01:00:00.64 like, everyone just wants to like do good, especially his guys. Yeah. They want to, they want to
01:00:00.64 --> 01:00:06.96 kick ass form. And so, I had my guns on my back, but I didn't like have it retention or anything.
01:00:06.96 --> 01:00:13.04 So, I went down to like grab his upper torso and my gun comes over top and hits him on the
01:00:13.04 --> 01:00:20.16 head. And I was, he was like, oh my god, who did that? Thank God it was night time.
01:00:20.16 --> 01:00:25.36 And you couldn't see you did it. And I got it. Joko, I didn't take extreme ownership
01:00:26.08 --> 01:00:31.76 because he wanted guilty. And I just like, I just, we got him up and we, you know, we started
01:00:31.76 --> 01:00:38.72 moving in, but extreme ownership might have cost me my life right there. So, yeah, we didn't,
01:00:38.72 --> 01:00:42.96 I didn't tell chief D that it was me that didn't sling my gun and just smack him in the face,
01:00:42.96 --> 01:00:50.72 but yeah, I think the good thing about the way that you ran training was that there was nothing that
01:00:50.72 --> 01:00:55.76 I ever faced that was even close to the training. And I think that's a good thing.
01:00:55.76 --> 01:01:00.40 I wasn't always happy with you about it. I remember one time you were out at, I think you
01:01:00.40 --> 01:01:05.84 were out at a San Clemente or something. And instead of like, okay, we, we do the day runs,
01:01:05.84 --> 01:01:10.16 we do the night runs, we go to sleep. There, you didn't let us go to sleep. It was just like,
01:01:10.16 --> 01:01:14.56 okay, TST, here we go. We're going back in the town. We got to go hit this and I'm like,
01:01:15.28 --> 01:01:21.60 God, dude. Well, I always thought of like day runs, night runs, morning runs. I made after noon runs.
01:01:21.60 --> 01:01:25.12 Yeah. You know, brunch runs. How's that sound? We'll get a little bit of that.
01:01:25.76 --> 01:01:31.04 And Stoner was your to you commander? Yeah, he was, uh, he was the to you commander there from
01:01:31.04 --> 01:01:37.52 O6 to O8, right after you left. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And that's when he got, that's when he got hurt.
01:01:37.52 --> 01:01:45.52 Yep. He broke his neck. Uh, yeah. That happened. Luckily, he didn't break his spine. He just broke
01:01:45.52 --> 01:01:51.20 vertebrae and his neck when a dude fell off. One of the other new guys fell off of the ship
01:01:51.20 --> 01:01:57.84 boarding and landed on top of him broke his neck. I remember I was at, obviously, I was at Traydeck
01:01:57.84 --> 01:02:01.92 and I get the call like, hey, we got an injury and I'm like, all right, Roger. And then I got like a
01:02:01.92 --> 01:02:08.16 text from someone's like, hey, it's Stoner. And I was like, check, went up to the hospital. But thank God,
01:02:08.16 --> 01:02:14.88 he, uh, he didn't break his spinal cord. So he was able to put on the neck brace,
01:02:15.68 --> 01:02:20.48 kind of walk through the rest of until that was healed up and, and he still able to go on
01:02:20.48 --> 01:02:26.48 appointment because he wasn't going to stay home. I mean, no, no. Well, that brings up another
01:02:26.48 --> 01:02:34.16 funny story because, uh, remember, uh, I don't know if this guy's still in. Anyway, our L.T.
01:02:34.88 --> 01:02:43.20 During that period, Texan guy, Jimmy. Yep. He, uh, he made us roll. He made us do jujitsu three times a week.
01:02:43.20 --> 01:02:48.40 Yeah, right? These, you know, all of them, you know, fall into following this guy's footstep.
01:02:49.12 --> 01:02:55.68 And so we would, we would roll. We did jujitsu before, uh, before the day started and, uh,
01:02:55.68 --> 01:03:00.72 I remember one time, I got somebody, I can't remember who it was. Another L.T.
01:03:01.36 --> 01:03:06.88 in a triangle choke. And I, I was tying it in good and he picked me up, stacked me and
01:03:06.88 --> 01:03:12.80 dropped me on my neck and I heard something go pop, pop. And I was like, okay, you know, and we
01:03:12.80 --> 01:03:17.52 did a quick time out and I was like, okay, I can still move it. And then we, we finished the day.
01:03:17.52 --> 01:03:22.96 I'm okay. Like, we finished the rolling. I feel okay. And then it's take a shower and then it starts
01:03:22.96 --> 01:03:28.48 getting real tight and real stiff. And I, I'm like, man, I, this is, this doesn't feel right.
01:03:28.48 --> 01:03:33.36 Maybe I should go say something. So I've made a mistake and I went and said something. And I told
01:03:33.36 --> 01:03:36.96 Chris, I was like, hey, I did something while I was rolling. I heard some pops in my neck.
01:03:37.68 --> 01:03:43.04 And, uh, it's starting to get really, really tight. And he's like, okay, go over to medical. So medical
01:03:43.04 --> 01:03:50.64 made, um, called an ambu. It came to the, to this, you know, three picked me up, put, like,
01:03:50.64 --> 01:03:56.88 put me on like a bed or whatever they took me to Balboa, they'd X-rays or whatever. And they're like,
01:03:57.60 --> 01:04:02.56 you know, they're like, oh, you're good. You're good to go. So they brought me back and, uh,
01:04:02.56 --> 01:04:08.96 put they made me put a neck brace on. And so I walk into C-chris and, uh, and I take in the neck
01:04:08.96 --> 01:04:13.60 brace off. And he's like, so, uh, what would happen? And I'm like, I'm good to go. They did X-rays.
01:04:14.16 --> 01:04:17.44 He's like, did they give you anything? And I'm like, well, this neck brace, but, you know,
01:04:17.44 --> 01:04:22.80 I don't need it. I'm good. And he's like, no, put the neck brace on. So, Chris had the guys paint
01:04:22.80 --> 01:04:28.64 it pink. And then made me wear the neck brace for like the next week. And I was like, even when we,
01:04:28.64 --> 01:04:32.56 like, because we were just getting ready to go to Pendleton. And so he made me wear it out and
01:04:32.56 --> 01:04:37.92 town. He made me wear it everywhere. And I was just like, oh, and I'm never saying anything ever
01:04:37.92 --> 01:04:49.84 to get like I said, like that's a flood. Yeah. And then, uh, so how was that deployment? It was, you know,
01:04:49.84 --> 01:04:57.04 it was, I think it was good. I know a lot of guys weren't happy about it. But, um, we started on the
01:04:57.04 --> 01:05:03.84 Syrian border in Al-Qaim. We turned over with an SF unit. And the deployment started out by
01:05:03.84 --> 01:05:11.92 with our primary focus trying to stop foreign fighters and equipment and, you know, all sorts of
01:05:11.92 --> 01:05:17.12 money and stuff flowing in from Syria into Iraq. And so we did a lot of desert patrols.
01:05:19.28 --> 01:05:24.56 And, you know, that it's not, I don't think it's what team guys really love doing. But it, you know,
01:05:24.56 --> 01:05:32.24 it is what it is. And then probably, and we actually spent a lot of the first month and a half building
01:05:32.24 --> 01:05:37.68 up a structure to live in. So we called ourselves seal beasts. Like we had two CBs that were like
01:05:37.68 --> 01:05:41.84 constantly telling us what to do, how to build this structure. And so we built that. And then,
01:05:43.04 --> 01:05:49.76 after we got that finished, um, that's when I think the army called and said, hey, we're, we're going
01:05:49.76 --> 01:05:55.76 to, we're going to, we're going to cordon off, solder city. And we need some seal snipers. And
01:05:55.76 --> 01:06:02.24 some guys to come in and help us do that because, uh, all solder's militia was killing the Iraqi
01:06:02.24 --> 01:06:10.48 contractors that were building the wall. And so that's when Stoner and Chris and several other
01:06:10.48 --> 01:06:16.16 guys, somewhere, army 33 texts, some, some were calm skies and many of them were snipers,
01:06:17.12 --> 01:06:21.04 from seal team eight. And then from seal team three, they formed like this super troop,
01:06:21.04 --> 01:06:29.28 um, which Topstoner was in charge of. And so they, they went and left us, I think four of them
01:06:29.28 --> 01:06:35.36 went from our platoon. And then the rest of us stayed back and we just went all over, you know,
01:06:35.36 --> 01:06:41.76 went all over the country. We flew some humvies up to Missoul. And then towards the end of the
01:06:41.76 --> 01:06:47.44 deployment, Chris came back and I actually got to go and, you know, be a part of that for like the
01:06:47.44 --> 01:06:52.40 last month and a half or something like that. But it was, you know, it was a decent platoon,
01:06:52.40 --> 01:06:59.12 but we were all over, I mean, instead of operating out of one place, we spent time in Alessad,
01:06:59.12 --> 01:07:05.36 we spent time and I think hit Haditha, we even, we even built the new basin, Rawa,
01:07:05.36 --> 01:07:10.80 when Alkaya got shut down. So we were just like transit all over the place. Yeah, yeah, that there's
01:07:10.80 --> 01:07:17.36 it always sucks when you're not like with your whole platoon. It's also there's cool things about
01:07:17.36 --> 01:07:23.68 traveling all over the place that my first deployment to Iraq, we lived in Baghdad the whole time,
01:07:23.68 --> 01:07:28.000 but we would go out to all over the country. So that was kind of, you know, you just get to see
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.08 different areas and we'd stay for day here two days here, some random like SF outstation,
01:07:34.08 --> 01:07:39.68 the middle nowhere and hang out with them, do whatever we can to support and then come back. So that's
01:07:39.68 --> 01:07:44.24 kind of cool. And then my second deployment to Iraq, I didn't leave her body like it was just
01:07:44.24 --> 01:07:50.80 there the entire time and that was also cool in a different way. So kind of different experiences,
01:07:50.80 --> 01:07:55.12 they both have something cool about them. They also have some things that kind of, you know,
01:07:55.12 --> 01:08:02.64 might not be as cool, but what was like the big lessons learned on that deployment for you as a human.
01:08:02.64 --> 01:08:15.28 Oh man, let's see, be you know, be flexible, you know, be adaptable. I found that that was so
01:08:15.28 --> 01:08:22.88 key in that in that job is just to be flexible, adaptable and try and keep a positive mental outlook
01:08:22.88 --> 01:08:27.20 it all, you know, at all times. And the other thing to I started to see like,
01:08:27.20 --> 01:08:38.48 started to see how negativity and complaining could affect the morale of the group and it,
01:08:39.04 --> 01:08:47.36 you know, it could be detrimental. And so always try and, you know, be, you know, be a part of
01:08:48.16 --> 01:08:53.12 not bringing people down, bringing the group down, but just being positive, you know, because there was
01:08:53.12 --> 01:09:00.24 some, there was some of that going on in that group, like, you know, some real negativity and,
01:09:00.24 --> 01:09:08.08 you know, I get it, I understand why, but at the same time, I don't, I don't know that it,
01:09:08.08 --> 01:09:14.96 you know, was very productive, making us the most cohesive, you know, fighting unit that we could
01:09:14.96 --> 01:09:24.24 possibly be. Yeah, when that real simple idea of complaining and it's so bad. And that's one thing
01:09:24.24 --> 01:09:30.88 I picked up from wherever in the teams was like, hey, don't complain, don't ever complain about anything,
01:09:30.88 --> 01:09:34.48 don't complain if you're cold, don't complain if you're hot, don't complain if you've been
01:09:34.48 --> 01:09:40.56 awake too long, don't complain about anything, just don't complain, just don't complain. And, you know,
01:09:40.56 --> 01:09:46.40 obviously not everyone gets on board with that program, but it never, it never, complaining just never
01:09:46.40 --> 01:09:51.12 helps anything, just doesn't, like if you, if you want to joke about it, that's cool. If you want to
01:09:51.12 --> 01:09:57.12 jokingly, you know, bring something up because you're going to make fun of the situation you're in,
01:09:57.12 --> 01:10:01.92 man, that's a different thing. But if you're going to, if you're going to seriously say,
01:10:03.04 --> 01:10:08.000 it's too hot, it's too cold, we're not getting the support, we need this is bullshit. Like those
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.92 attitudes, they're just, they're just, they're just, they're just not good. And that's why I always
01:10:11.92 --> 01:10:17.92 like that, that team guy that you just never hear him complain or when someone does complain,
01:10:17.92 --> 01:10:22.40 when you get, when you get the right crew, someone starts to complain, they get shut down, you know,
01:10:22.40 --> 01:10:29.12 and that's a good attitude to have. Is that where good? That is, that is 100% where good
01:10:29.12 --> 01:10:33.44 comes from. That's, that's freaking stone or that was stone or coming to tell me, coming to
01:10:33.44 --> 01:10:37.68 complain me about something and me saying, and him saying, like, I already know what you're going to say,
01:10:37.68 --> 01:10:41.76 and I'm like, what? And he says, you're going to say good, because that's what you say about everything,
01:10:41.76 --> 01:10:45.92 and it's true. I'd be like, oh, we don't, we don't, oh, we're going to have to stay out,
01:10:45.92 --> 01:10:50.64 freaking at this desert warfare training facility for an extra two weeks. Good, we're going to get
01:10:50.64 --> 01:10:58.000 better, whatever it is. Yeah. Let's not complain. That's not the deal. So you don't want
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.92 from that deployment. Yep. And it's another puttune because you're a new guy still kind of,
01:11:03.92 --> 01:11:09.60 now you're one cruise wonder, one and a half cruise wonder. Right. Right. There's always something,
01:11:09.60 --> 01:11:15.92 Matt. Did you go, did you end up going back to sniper school? I did. Yeah. Where, when you got home?
01:11:15.92 --> 01:11:22.88 Yeah. So thankfully, I, I just got to go qualify and then I got to pick up where I left off.
01:11:22.88 --> 01:11:28.000 I learned a little trick that really helped me, you know how on our pistols you, you know,
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.80 front sight focus, you have that little green dot and whatever or the little white dot.
01:11:33.36 --> 01:11:38.000 Wow, I was like, I was looking at the front sight post on my, you know, in four iron
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.32 side and I was like, it's just straight black. I mean, aim small, miss small. And I was like,
01:11:42.32 --> 01:11:48.16 I took a little paint pen and I just put the tiniest little white dot on my front sight post.
01:11:48.16 --> 01:11:53.12 And that really helped me to like put it where I needed to and just I started doing a lot of
01:11:53.12 --> 01:11:57.68 dry firing and the positions that I was going to have to shoot and did well on the test and then
01:11:58.40 --> 01:12:02.80 went out to, went out to sniper school. I did really good on the shooting, but I was really
01:12:02.80 --> 01:12:08.64 bad at the stocking and I was like on the bubble the entire time. And, but, you know, made it through
01:12:08.64 --> 01:12:16.24 sniper school got my sniper sweet and then, unfortunately, by that point in 2010, we went to
01:12:16.24 --> 01:12:23.92 Felicia and they wouldn't allow us to take sniper weapons on, obviously, we're trying to de-escalate
01:12:23.92 --> 01:12:32.24 the war and snipers don't typically do that typically, they're gasoline on things. So, so that
01:12:32.24 --> 01:12:38.16 we still a pig gunner and that, or did we have to point manner somewhere? Yeah, I moved the point
01:12:38.16 --> 01:12:43.12 man and lead navigators as well. I was also running ordinance department. So,
01:12:43.12 --> 01:12:51.44 yeah, I mean, it was good. You know, and I was I felt, for the first time I felt like, I didn't
01:12:51.44 --> 01:12:59.04 feel like I was some great operator, but I felt like I felt confident for, you know, because it
01:12:59.04 --> 01:13:05.20 takes a while. I mean, there's so much that there's so much from like, comms to, you know,
01:13:05.20 --> 01:13:11.92 understanding maps to, you know, the physicality side of it to, you know, small unit tactics that
01:13:11.92 --> 01:13:17.36 you're trying to pick up and learn, but in that in special forces, you'll spend two, two weeks
01:13:17.36 --> 01:13:24.000 doing this and then you'll spend a month doing that and then sometimes it'll be four months before
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:30.96 before you shoot your gun again, you know, and it's like, so I feel like, by that point, you know,
01:13:30.96 --> 01:13:36.40 in my service, I finally felt like I was, you know, okay, I feel comfortable doing this, I feel like
01:13:36.40 --> 01:13:42.96 I'm decent at it, you know, the learning curve of doing Patuens, I think exactly correlates to the
01:13:42.96 --> 01:13:48.56 learning curve of having children and your first kid, you have no idea what's going on, your total
01:13:48.56 --> 01:13:53.28 idiot, and but you learned so much by your second kid, you're like, okay, we kind of got this,
01:13:53.28 --> 01:13:57.84 by your third kid, you're like, I'm dialed, I'm ready. By your fourth kid, you're like, I got this,
01:13:57.84 --> 01:14:04.72 like, we're making shit happen. But you see, guys, in their first Patuens man, it's a lot of,
01:14:04.72 --> 01:14:08.72 it's a lot of stuff, especially nowadays, like when I was in my first Patuens, it was like, okay,
01:14:08.72 --> 01:14:15.44 your radio man, there's three radios, like it's it was just we weren't doing knots, we didn't have
01:14:15.44 --> 01:14:22.000 lasers on a weapons, everything was easier and guys now they have a lot more to learn, just even
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.16 with the technical side there, more to learn and then from the operational side, there's more to learn,
01:14:26.16 --> 01:14:34.08 that's the way it goes. So that, what you do on that deployment, so, as you're as now,
01:14:34.08 --> 01:14:39.68 we're DSCliners, this is like 2010 now, yep, 2010 we're DSClinating, we were partnered up with
01:14:39.68 --> 01:14:44.40 FelusiusWatteam, we were still doing, you know, some DAs here and there, we were doing a lot of
01:14:44.40 --> 01:14:49.36 fit with them, making sure that, you know, they knew what they were doing, and we actually started
01:14:49.76 --> 01:14:55.84 me and one of our jails kind of ran the fit, and we were just making sure, we were trying to turn
01:14:55.84 --> 01:15:01.84 more and more of the op over to them, so by the time, by the time that platoon was over with,
01:15:01.84 --> 01:15:08.56 if we would go on an op and there were only allowed to be four seals on the ground, you had to have
01:15:08.56 --> 01:15:13.84 for every one seal, I think you had to have five Iraqis, that was the ratio it had to be,
01:15:14.64 --> 01:15:21.36 and so the, you know, the closest call I ever had was a night where we got ambushed by three
01:15:21.36 --> 01:15:28.88 dudes and we only had four seals on the ground, we had, we had, I think, two, three gun trucks,
01:15:28.88 --> 01:15:35.36 so we had three RG 33s with those remote weapon system, the remote 50 cows, but yeah, I mean,
01:15:35.36 --> 01:15:40.96 it was interesting getting, you know, an ambush like that, we're only got four dudes, and then a bunch
01:15:40.96 --> 01:15:49.60 of a bunch of FelusiusWatteam guys and you're like, you know, at one point, our AOS at the time,
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.92 he was like, he was on my side of the street, just give us, like, give us, start to finish a little bit.
01:15:55.92 --> 01:16:02.88 Okay, so it was really interesting, Jaco, because as we were turning over things to the Iraqis so
01:16:02.88 --> 01:16:07.68 that they could hopefully stand on their own once we left, one of the, one of the very last things
01:16:07.68 --> 01:16:12.56 that we turned over to them was the actual coordinates for the target we were going to hit,
01:16:12.56 --> 01:16:18.08 and as a point man, I was sharing that responsibility with another, another one of my, you know,
01:16:18.08 --> 01:16:23.52 another, another guy in that platoon, and so we were, we were like doing blue and gold shifts,
01:16:23.52 --> 01:16:29.04 it was my night, and so they gave me like, hey, this is the, this is the eight-digit grid we're hitting,
01:16:29.04 --> 01:16:35.04 these are, you know, maps, you know, of the area that we're going to, we were actually going to
01:16:35.04 --> 01:16:42.80 obbograbe, which is like a suburb of Baghdad, and which of these like a 45-minute drive from Felusia,
01:16:42.80 --> 01:16:47.28 and so they were like, you know, notoriously nasty part of the city, yeah, the, like the
01:16:47.28 --> 01:16:51.28 prisons there that everyone's heard about obbograbe prison, but it's also like a part of town,
01:16:51.28 --> 01:16:57.44 and it's, it's notoriously a pretty bad part of town. Yeah, it was a real bad part, and anyway,
01:16:57.44 --> 01:17:02.64 so they, I can't remember who told me, but they were like, hey, like this is the first night,
01:17:02.64 --> 01:17:07.76 we're going to give these guys a great coordinates, so I want you to walk over there with an interpreter,
01:17:08.48 --> 01:17:12.88 well, you know, go outside our main base, go to there where they, where they were sleeping,
01:17:13.44 --> 01:17:18.72 the Felusia SWAT team, given the great coordinates for the target we're hitting, and I
01:17:18.72 --> 01:17:22.48 ask them, make sure that they know where we're going, because they're actually going to lead
01:17:22.48 --> 01:17:27.60 lead us out. And so I walked over there, I gave them the, you know, the great coordinate,
01:17:28.32 --> 01:17:31.36 I gave them all the maps and pictures, I was like, do you guys know where this is, and they're like,
01:17:31.36 --> 01:17:36.72 yeah, we know where this is, and so I was like, and at the time we had you feel funky about that.
01:17:36.72 --> 01:17:42.48 Very, and this made it worse to, we knew that there was one of them that was every time we left
01:17:42.48 --> 01:17:49.44 the wire that he was calling and telling people which direction we were headed. So, you know, you always,
01:17:49.44 --> 01:17:55.28 you always feel really, really shady about that. And so, gave it to them, and then probably at like
01:17:55.28 --> 01:18:01.04 one in the morning or something we took off started driving there. And I noticed,
01:18:01.04 --> 01:18:06.16 as soon as we drive into the neighborhood, there's like, sirens on all over the neighborhood,
01:18:06.16 --> 01:18:14.32 and like, like, we're already blown. And so we did like a video, a video drop off, like, vehicle
01:18:14.32 --> 01:18:18.48 drop off, like 600 yards from the target, because the argys are pretty loud, and we didn't want
01:18:18.48 --> 01:18:24.48 them to hear us like foot patrolling in or the vehicles. And so we get out, and there's four seals on
01:18:24.48 --> 01:18:30.48 the ground, and then there's like 20, fullo's your SWAT team members, and we start taking off,
01:18:30.48 --> 01:18:36.80 and I'm also point man that night. So, it's like a 600, it's only a 600 yard patrol in the target. And so,
01:18:36.80 --> 01:18:42.32 we're walking down this really, really wide street. And so I put us into like a file formation,
01:18:42.32 --> 01:18:47.92 so that at least a couple of us can engage if we get a contact front. And so we're walking in
01:18:47.92 --> 01:18:52.88 and probably halfway to the target. And I noticed that like, I guess.
01:18:52.88 --> 01:18:56.88 Oh, staggered file, you said fire, you meant staggered file, yeah. Okay, I'll get, I'll just try to
01:18:56.88 --> 01:19:04.000 make sure I'm tracking. No, no, no, no, thanks. And so we're walking, and, and I'm noticing as I'm
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.84 walking, because you're always when you're patrolling, you're always looking for like cover,
01:19:07.84 --> 01:19:13.52 concealment, hey, if we get contacted from the front, where can I duck into, is there a wall, or a
01:19:13.52 --> 01:19:20.000 door, something like, and I notice everything's boarded up, bars everywhere, nothing is open. And so
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:28.88 halfway there, all of a sudden, do three dudes with one had an RPK machine gun, and then the
01:19:28.88 --> 01:19:35.28 other two, I think had AK's. But we had a, we had a predator overhead, we had, I think two
01:19:35.28 --> 01:19:42.32 Apache's, and we had an AC 130 gun ship overhead. I'd never, we'd never gotten that much air
01:19:42.32 --> 01:19:49.76 in any op I'd ever been on it. And so three guys open up on us, and it was surreal because they
01:19:49.76 --> 01:19:56.96 guy with the RPK, no kid had probably 200 rounds belted together of Tracer. So you could see every bullet
01:19:56.96 --> 01:20:04.80 fine over us. And you know, in training that you're taught, okay, you hit the ground, make yourself
01:20:04.80 --> 01:20:08.88 as small as possible, make yourself a small target, and then return fire, gain fire,
01:20:08.88 --> 01:20:14.32 spirit, and then somebody's gonna, you know, we're, we're gonna maneuver, whatever the call is
01:20:14.32 --> 01:20:20.64 gonna come out, it's gonna be. And so I remember hitting the ground and just watching, you know,
01:20:20.64 --> 01:20:26.48 Tracer rounds fly over us for probably a minute and a half before he had to reload. And then I could
01:20:26.48 --> 01:20:33.28 see the other two, the other two guys, muzzle flashes, I'm thinking to myself, I thought, you know what,
01:20:33.28 --> 01:20:37.92 if I can see their muzzle flashes, even though I have a suppressor on my gun, because they're shooting
01:20:37.92 --> 01:20:43.44 high. I was like, if I open up right now, and the, the suppressor doesn't work as well as I hope
01:20:43.44 --> 01:20:48.64 it does. And they, they pinpoint my location, I'm dead, because it was, when we went back and looked
01:20:48.64 --> 01:20:56.56 at the footage from the Pred, feed, it was only 110 yard engagement. So it's very close. And so I did,
01:20:56.56 --> 01:21:00.64 where they, in a building, where they on a roof or something or not, they were coming, they were
01:21:00.64 --> 01:21:05.92 coming around a building. So I got to watch like, so they were external, so you could actually
01:21:05.92 --> 01:21:10.000 see them even from the Pred, because they were outside of the building. You could see them from the Pred,
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:16.48 I couldn't see them, you know, even on nods. All I could see was their muzzle flash. And so anyway,
01:21:17.36 --> 01:21:23.68 like I wait, and I noticed that the, the, the, the little of fire dies down, and so as soon as it dies
01:21:23.68 --> 01:21:29.36 down, like I get up, and I'm like I said, I'm really slow. So, but I'm running back, you know,
01:21:29.36 --> 01:21:35.28 I'm, I must have been cooking echo. And I'm like, I'm moving as fast as I can. And I'm pretty,
01:21:35.28 --> 01:21:40.56 I'm pretty light. I only have, I think, four mags on me, you know, in four mags on me. And I'm running back.
01:21:40.56 --> 01:21:45.76 And the, oh, I see, I see his over here. And he had found, he's like, I got, I got an out,
01:21:45.76 --> 01:21:50.88 I got an out, and that for us means hey, man, I got some cover, come over here. And so I come over and
01:21:50.88 --> 01:21:58.32 I start, I bump him off and then, you know, start, I start returning fire and the gun trucks by this
01:21:58.32 --> 01:22:05.12 point pull up. Next, you know, next to me. And then this fight, I don't know, goes, this gun fight
01:22:05.12 --> 01:22:10.88 goes on for, I don't know, maybe maybe another couple minutes. And then the gun trucks start, you know,
01:22:10.88 --> 01:22:15.44 blasting these dudes with 50 cow and it like ends like that. They're like, no, we're done.
01:22:16.32 --> 01:22:23.52 But it was, it was, it was interesting because like, the, the A O I C was like, hey,
01:22:23.52 --> 01:22:29.60 let's flank. Let's, let's, let's, let's, and I, I was just thinking of myself, I was thinking of myself,
01:22:29.60 --> 01:22:34.08 hey, we were already blown when we came in. These guys, the gig was up. They knew we were coming here,
01:22:34.08 --> 01:22:39.04 because they were sirens all over the place. We've got a bunch of, you know, flujious,
01:22:39.04 --> 01:22:44.24 swat team guys. We know at least one of them is working on the other side. And they're not like,
01:22:44.24 --> 01:22:49.20 they're not a good fighting force at all. I'm like, I was like, bro, I don't think that's a good idea.
01:22:49.20 --> 01:22:56.16 And I see we hold what we got and get the hell out of here. And thankfully, you know, and I don't know how
01:22:56.16 --> 01:23:01.52 it would have worked out if we would have done, you know, what he wanted to, he was just being a
01:23:01.52 --> 01:23:08.24 hard charging, you know, oh, he was, he wanted to make moves and, you know, go just smoke these dudes.
01:23:08.24 --> 01:23:14.24 But I had a real bad feeling about it. And so, you know, thankfully he was like, he listened to me,
01:23:14.24 --> 01:23:18.80 and he was like, let's hold what we got. And we, you know, jumped in the trucks and we got the
01:23:18.80 --> 01:23:23.76 got the hell out of there. And then it was crazy because we, because Blir, not, it was actually
01:23:26.56 --> 01:23:33.68 Iraqi policeman that ambushed us. And so then they roll up. And it's like this, it's gets this
01:23:33.68 --> 01:23:40.40 heated exchange, like, what WTF, or you guys doing, you know, because we had to pass, you know,
01:23:40.40 --> 01:23:43.92 how that works, we have to pass up to, you know, their hire, I was like, where we're going to be
01:23:43.92 --> 01:23:50.08 operating. So there's the de-confliction that goes on. And it got really, it was starting to get a little
01:23:50.08 --> 01:23:55.44 tense. And I remember there were, we had some guys in the trucks, you know, just some shooters in
01:23:55.44 --> 01:24:00.96 the trucks. I'm like, hey, you guys get out of those trucks. If this goes down, we need to, we need to
01:24:00.96 --> 01:24:08.08 make sure that we finish this. And so anyway, nobody got, nobody got hurt on our side, which I couldn't
01:24:08.08 --> 01:24:12.88 believe because like I was watching hundreds of tracer rounds stream into what my chief's position.
01:24:12.88 --> 01:24:18.000 I thought he was done because he didn't come up over coms for probably 40 seconds to kind of make
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.80 a call on what he wanted. But anyway, we got back, we drove back to Felicia after that. And it was
01:24:24.80 --> 01:24:33.92 kind of wild because the ROI I see at the time, who was actually, who was actually my swim buddy
01:24:33.92 --> 01:24:39.84 and buds and I really good friend of mine. He, you know, thankfully, he didn't bring this up in the
01:24:39.84 --> 01:24:45.60 de-breed, but he was like, he came to me in the team room and he was like, he like, well, what were you
01:24:45.60 --> 01:24:51.04 doing? What were you doing tonight? And I'm like, what are you talking about, dude? He's like,
01:24:51.04 --> 01:24:58.16 how was screaming at you from inside the RG 33 to get back? Because I was, once I bumped that guy out,
01:24:58.16 --> 01:25:02.96 I came out on the left and I started trying to engage their muzzle flashes with my laser.
01:25:02.96 --> 01:25:10.72 And he was like, he's like, bro, he's like, the wall right behind you, rounds were exploding right
01:25:10.72 --> 01:25:15.52 over your head. They had a total beat on you. They were just shooting like a foot high. And I was like,
01:25:15.52 --> 01:25:20.000 dude, I'm sorry, bro, I could not hear you. And that's one thing I learned on that deployment
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:25.68 is that those cool silencers that we have that like work as coms pieces, but also ear pro,
01:25:26.32 --> 01:25:31.92 you can't hear the crack over your head because they cancel that anything over like 105
01:25:31.92 --> 01:25:35.84 decibels or whatever they were canceling it out. So I couldn't hear it. I didn't know they had a
01:25:35.84 --> 01:25:45.28 beat on me, but thankfully, it was down to you too. Thankfully, moves you to the Ohio. Thank God,
01:25:45.28 --> 01:25:53.44 man. But yeah, that was, that was interesting because because of the situation and we had so many
01:25:53.44 --> 01:26:00.88 jundies or you know, I right, flu just watch team members with us, it really limited our ability
01:26:00.88 --> 01:26:13.68 to do stuff when we needed to. So you wrap up that deployment and then what's your plan?
01:26:14.24 --> 01:26:19.92 Because now you've got two platoons, you maybe could do a third platoon, you maybe could go to training
01:26:19.92 --> 01:26:24.72 cell or trade debt, maybe you know, what's your options? What are you looking at? What are you
01:26:24.72 --> 01:26:30.64 making up your mind to do? Yeah. So I was looking at a couple different things. My body was pretty
01:26:30.64 --> 01:26:37.52 tore up at that point. I'd hurt my back really bad, you know, weightlifting. And I had,
01:26:38.40 --> 01:26:42.96 the Navy wasn't able to diagnose it at the time. Turns out, once I got out of the Navy and went
01:26:42.96 --> 01:26:47.68 to like a civilian dock, like laser spine instituted in Phoenix, they were like, hey, man, you got,
01:26:47.68 --> 01:26:53.44 you know, you got some stress fractures and you're spine, you've got some, you know, some stuff going
01:26:53.44 --> 01:26:58.56 on, we can either give you a fusion or we can just give you shots and I was just like, okay, I'll just
01:26:58.56 --> 01:27:03.76 wait. But my back was pretty messed up at that time. It really, you know, was pretty excruciating,
01:27:03.76 --> 01:27:09.60 just don't even wear a body armor. And so I'm looking at that. I'm looking at the fact that I've
01:27:09.60 --> 01:27:17.52 kind of done what I came to do as far as like I wanted to go serve my country and and I had little
01:27:17.52 --> 01:27:21.44 you know, I was kind of watching my little kids grow up in pictures or my oldest grow up in pictures.
01:27:21.44 --> 01:27:27.76 And I was just like, man, you know, that was kind of tearing, tearing at me a little bit. And so I was like,
01:27:28.48 --> 01:27:35.12 I'm either going to go, um, through our like ASO program. I need something new if I'm in a
01:27:35.12 --> 01:27:41.12 stay and do this, I'm going to either need to go like ASO or screen or something. But I'm not, you know,
01:27:41.12 --> 01:27:45.68 I need to, you know, I need to, you know, I need to some change. And so, started thinking about it,
01:27:45.68 --> 01:27:50.72 I was definitely praying about it. And uh, while I was on that deployment, I actually was like,
01:27:50.72 --> 01:27:54.16 but I want to make sure that I give myself enough time to make a good decision.
01:27:54.80 --> 01:28:00.000 Because my family's counting on it. And so I actually reinlisted on that deployment. And,
01:28:00.72 --> 01:28:05.28 at the time, you could give your kids the GI Bill if you reinlisted, you had enough time in,
01:28:06.24 --> 01:28:12.96 and, you know, uh, and so I split, I gave my daughter my GI Bill and re-listed for four, so that I had
01:28:12.96 --> 01:28:18.88 enough time to plan the exit and at that point, I was pretty confident that I was done, you know,
01:28:19.68 --> 01:28:25.52 you know, the point and I was, I started focusing on, okay, I need it, I need to exit.
01:28:26.24 --> 01:28:32.16 And, uh, I did, I did, you know, talk to some folks about ASO. I looked at it a little bit. I never
01:28:32.16 --> 01:28:38.48 really looked at screening. Um, and then as I went, I went to the recruiting director it after that.
01:28:38.48 --> 01:28:43.04 So that's when you got home from the deployment. Yes. You went to the recruiting director it.
01:28:43.04 --> 01:28:50.08 I don't even know what that is. Right. No, most people don't. Um, so when I came, is it an SW?
01:28:50.08 --> 01:28:57.28 Yes, sir. Yeah, got it. When I came into the teams, uh, we only were filling 60% of our
01:28:57.28 --> 01:29:03.20 billets at the schoolhouse. So that's why guys like me could come, you know, I knew guys that went
01:29:03.20 --> 01:29:10.80 to Buds three or four times. But now if you even if you come, well, I'm working off old information.
01:29:10.80 --> 01:29:15.44 But when I was at the recruiting director, even if you like were an Olympic athlete and you came
01:29:15.44 --> 01:29:19.84 in there and you crushed the screen test like it never been crushed before, early as Spot Year
01:29:19.84 --> 01:29:27.04 again was nine months out, you know. And so, um, what what the Navy did was, and the reason I took
01:29:27.04 --> 01:29:34.96 the job is because my old platoon chief and old, um, you know, master chief, uh, J.T. You know,
01:29:34.96 --> 01:29:39.60 J.T. Yep. Yep. He, uh, he said, hey, hey, Eli, if you come work for me, I'll let you go to school
01:29:39.60 --> 01:29:44.96 in the afternoon. So you can finish up that old degree, start working towards getting out and I'm like,
01:29:44.96 --> 01:29:51.52 no, that sounds like pretty cool. And, uh, so I took that job, started doing that, uh, working for him.
01:29:51.52 --> 01:29:58.08 And, uh, you know, it was, it was, it was interesting because the Navy sent us all over the country.
01:29:58.64 --> 01:30:03.84 They had done a Gallup survey that showed that there were seven different sports that young men were playing,
01:30:05.20 --> 01:30:11.20 that were, uh, enabling them to be more successful at a higher rate than, um, others.
01:30:11.20 --> 01:30:16.24 We're lucky. So one was Warripolo. I think two was swimming and three was wrestling.
01:30:16.24 --> 01:30:21.92 And that's where we spent most of our time. And it made total sense to me because like football players
01:30:22.16 --> 01:30:26.48 weren't doing well. And it made sense to me because like I was a quarterback and they were like,
01:30:26.88 --> 01:30:31.68 you know, they put a red jersey on me, like, don't hit that dude. Or like, you know, it was like,
01:30:31.68 --> 01:30:36.48 it was so position driven in football that, and when you look at it like wrestling,
01:30:36.48 --> 01:30:41.20 water pool swimming, you know, the types of sports like that were it's like, it doesn't matter.
01:30:41.20 --> 01:30:46.96 How big you are, you're doing everything. You know, and you're going to be held to a standard, you know,
01:30:46.96 --> 01:30:51.36 I mean, you look at Big Old Echo or what position you play Echo. What do you see?
01:30:51.36 --> 01:30:55.04 I was a lot smaller. You guys were hitting me. His only 185 back there. Oh my god.
01:30:55.04 --> 01:30:57.20 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Long time ago. Holy cow.
01:30:57.92 --> 01:31:01.68 Did you like eat a cornerback or something? Like, actually, it's so mean too.
01:31:02.80 --> 01:31:07.60 But yeah, like, even as like, you know, it's a wide receiver that they would make, you know,
01:31:07.60 --> 01:31:12.48 you know how it was. It was like, okay, this is your position. This is what we want you to be good at.
01:31:12.48 --> 01:31:19.60 But we're not going to focus you in in in the in seal training bro. It's like nobody cares how big you are.
01:31:19.60 --> 01:31:25.12 What position you play. It's like you're doing you're doing everything. You know, so
01:31:25.76 --> 01:31:30.40 those are the sports that the NSW director, it was trying to raise awareness.
01:31:30.40 --> 01:31:33.84 But you said seven sports. That's three. What were the other four? You remember?
01:31:33.84 --> 01:31:41.28 Yeah, I was like crew cross country. I think, look, cross.
01:31:41.28 --> 01:31:50.64 Cross. That's the water polo. Yeah. Yeah. So it was, but that's where we spent the most of our time on those three.
01:31:51.36 --> 01:31:58.000 And they would send what they called seal scouts around to those type of events in high school
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.80 college. And we what we would do is we would show a video of like you can't you can't recruit a seal.
01:32:02.80 --> 01:32:08.16 If you have to talk somebody in to show it up to that and then they see it for real. They're like, no.
01:32:08.80 --> 01:32:14.08 I'm not doing this. So what we would actually try and do is just raise awareness like this is an
01:32:14.08 --> 01:32:21.76 option for you and then and then leave and then let them, you know, self select themselves into it.
01:32:21.76 --> 01:32:25.92 And so we go around the country doing that. So I did that for about a year and a half. And then
01:32:25.92 --> 01:32:34.000 got an opportunity to go to trade it and be in a more ops. Got a spot in VVSS and I started,
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.68 you know, just learning from the guy who was the LPO at the time.
01:32:38.48 --> 01:32:42.24 Actually, got to go by his house last night and have a beer with him and have some dinner with them.
01:32:42.24 --> 01:32:48.64 But after that is when he left, he turned it over to me and I became the LPO of VVSS. And so
01:32:48.64 --> 01:32:55.60 honestly, that was the best training I got to go into entrepreneurship because, you know, as you know,
01:32:55.60 --> 01:33:03.20 like you you have like a hundred times more of this than I ever did. But I never got put in a
01:33:03.20 --> 01:33:08.88 leadership position like that where there were so many things that you had to account for, so many
01:33:08.88 --> 01:33:13.20 things that you were tracking on, making sure things are going to be in the right place. And then also
01:33:13.20 --> 01:33:19.44 when things don't go as planned, how do we flex, what do we do, what's the contingency. And so
01:33:20.16 --> 01:33:24.72 you know, that was a phenomenal opportunity for me because I was even running my small business,
01:33:24.72 --> 01:33:30.64 bottle breacher out of our one car garage in Point Loma while doing that and just working stupid
01:33:30.64 --> 01:33:38.48 hours. But you know, that was really helpful and you know, helping me learn how to be a better
01:33:38.48 --> 01:33:45.44 leader. But it was also cool to see to just, you know, being a part of being on the other side and
01:33:45.44 --> 01:33:51.28 watching, you know, the training cycle, how much goes into it and making sure that these guys are
01:33:51.28 --> 01:33:55.76 prepared when they go down right. So your teaching VVSS and you just mentioned this when you started
01:33:55.76 --> 01:34:02.000 ball breacher for the first time. Yeah. How did that come about? So it came about, I was actually,
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:07.04 I knew I was getting out. I probably had, you know, two and a half years before my time was up,
01:34:07.04 --> 01:34:13.76 but I watched a lot of my buddies get out before me that had the same credential, same qualifications.
01:34:13.76 --> 01:34:18.56 I watched them struggle. Like to find something that they could actually sink their teeth into.
01:34:19.12 --> 01:34:24.88 And I knew that wasn't even an option for me because I had a daughter or two at the time.
01:34:24.88 --> 01:34:30.16 And so I was like, man, you got to figure this out. And so it was a little bit of fear that was driving me
01:34:30.16 --> 01:34:37.76 but also going back to that identity early on. Like, you know, I didn't want to, you know,
01:34:38.32 --> 01:34:42.32 one of the things that my brothers used to call me was a fuck up. They used to call me that all the time.
01:34:43.20 --> 01:34:48.56 And I'm not trying to throw F moms on your show. I know this is, you know, some kids listen to the show,
01:34:48.56 --> 01:34:54.56 but, you know, it is what it is. And so there was a part of me that, you know, still had that identity
01:34:54.56 --> 01:35:00.64 in the back of my mind, like, hey, well, maybe you got lucky and became a seal, but this is when you're actually
01:35:00.64 --> 01:35:09.12 going to show the world that you are, you know, that F up. And so, you know, not only did I not want to be that,
01:35:09.12 --> 01:35:14.24 but I also wanted to make sure that my little girls and my wife were provided for. So like, I was doing that,
01:35:14.24 --> 01:35:20.000 you know, the VBSS thing, the IPO thing and running bottle breacher at the same time, but the way it
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:26.88 actually came about was I remember my little brother who is a Marine Corps pilot, he is a cober pilot.
01:35:26.88 --> 01:35:33.52 He went to the PI and at one of the outdoor markets there got a 50-calb on-lover and he brought it back
01:35:33.52 --> 01:35:38.40 and he gave it to me. And I was like, dude, what is this thing? It opened your beer? No way.
01:35:38.80 --> 01:35:44.08 Try it. Yep, sure enough it does. And I was like, dude, that's the coolest thing I've ever seen.
01:35:44.08 --> 01:35:48.16 And so I put it in my junk drawer and then when my buddies would come into my house,
01:35:48.16 --> 01:35:52.72 like watch a UFC or something, they were like, dude, that is badass. Where can I get one?
01:35:52.72 --> 01:35:55.44 And I was always like, I don't know, man unless you go to the Philippines.
01:35:56.24 --> 01:36:01.52 But I started thinking about it and I was actually one up to LA for Thanksgiving
01:36:01.92 --> 01:36:06.000 that my family members were having up there. And I remember on the way back I was like, dude,
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.92 that thing is cool, but it was real generic, just plain brass, all dinged up. And I was like,
01:36:11.92 --> 01:36:17.76 but it could be way better. And so I came back and I went into my garage and I spray painted it,
01:36:17.76 --> 01:36:23.60 black. And then I had bought a bunch of punishers stickers because I made platoon DVDs
01:36:23.60 --> 01:36:29.68 for my last platoon. And I took one of the little punishers stickers once the paint dried and I put
01:36:29.68 --> 01:36:36.40 it on there. And it was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my god, this thing is insane.
01:36:36.40 --> 01:36:40.88 And so I took it to work. You know, the next, you know, the next day or so I showed it to my buddies.
01:36:40.88 --> 01:36:46.000 They were like, dude, this is maybe the coolest thing I've ever seen. Make me want. Make me five for
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:51.60 every guy, my family. And so that's when the light bulb came on like this thing is cool, but it could
01:36:51.60 --> 01:36:56.16 be way better. And nobody that I knew of or any of my buddies knew of was selling them in the states.
01:36:56.16 --> 01:37:04.80 And so it was at that time my wife was she was running a couple online or want. She she had
01:37:04.80 --> 01:37:09.84 success with some online businesses, just small little online businesses like boutiques and stuff.
01:37:10.48 --> 01:37:15.76 But she knew how to work, you know, the store, the internet. And she graduated with a degree in, you
01:37:15.76 --> 01:37:24.08 know, business from U of A University of Arizona. So she was definitely had that part down where I was
01:37:24.08 --> 01:37:28.48 extremely weak. And I was like, babe, babe, do you think you can help me sell these online?
01:37:29.28 --> 01:37:33.92 She's like, oh, let me do some research and you know, I'll let you know. And so she comes back
01:37:33.92 --> 01:37:38.32 and she's like, yep, I know what we're going to do. She's like, we're going to sell them on Etsy.
01:37:38.88 --> 01:37:44.56 I'm like Etsy. What is Etsy? How about eBay or something I've heard of? And she's like, no, trust me.
01:37:44.56 --> 01:37:51.28 She's like, women shop on Etsy all the time. It's like an artisan, whatever, artisan, you know,
01:37:51.28 --> 01:37:57.60 website. And she's like, they will buy them for their men. And so we started them. And the first ones
01:37:58.64 --> 01:38:05.28 after that one that I already had. So I started buying dummy rounds online. And then I would, you know,
01:38:05.28 --> 01:38:10.96 I'd start practicing cutting them with a Dremel tool. You know, just like crawl, walk run, right?
01:38:10.96 --> 01:38:14.08 And that's what we used to say in the CO teams all the time. I was like, I just have to figure out.
01:38:14.08 --> 01:38:18.64 And I didn't know anything about manufacturing cutting metal. I was just a dude in the garage.
01:38:18.64 --> 01:38:24.08 And I don't know if I make that run. And so I cut like, I figured out how to get it down.
01:38:25.28 --> 01:38:31.76 And this was kind of cool. It would take me, it would take me about, I think, 25 minutes to cut one
01:38:31.76 --> 01:38:37.84 when I started. And they look like crap, but people still bought them. But then I started getting
01:38:37.84 --> 01:38:43.12 real square away with my manufacturing. And I realized, Draco, that the tip of my broom handle,
01:38:43.12 --> 01:38:49.44 that I cut off with a Dremel tool fit perfectly over a 50-cow round. So now I could make a fixture,
01:38:49.44 --> 01:38:55.20 my first fixture. And I cut, I cut the cut into the broom handle. And then I take a Sharpie marker.
01:38:55.20 --> 01:38:59.76 And I would actually draw the cut on there. So that, because it was taking me seven minutes,
01:38:59.76 --> 01:39:04.88 I time myself to actually like take a take measuring cloth, measure out all the, all the dots,
01:39:04.88 --> 01:39:10.000 then connect them. And then I would take my Dremel tool, put it in a vison cut-up. And so that was my first
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:16.56 fixture. And then now, now we were, now we were cooking. And so they were, you know, they were still
01:39:16.56 --> 01:39:21.84 really rough. Like I would prime up, then I'd paint them. And then I was like, okay, if these team
01:39:21.84 --> 01:39:26.72 guys who, you know, get everything, you know, people think they're the coolest dudes in the world
01:39:26.72 --> 01:39:30.72 they're willing to buy them. Anybody would buy them. I just have to figure out, market it to somebody else.
01:39:30.72 --> 01:39:35.60 So I started thinking, okay, these are going to be big in the military units, firemen,
01:39:35.60 --> 01:39:40.64 cops, etc. And so I started buying stickers online. And I started painting them and putting
01:39:40.64 --> 01:39:45.44 stickers on them. And we would market them that way. And it was interesting because, you know,
01:39:45.44 --> 01:39:50.000 when you start selling stuff, typically you want to start your price point high,
01:39:50.56 --> 01:39:53.92 and then work down until you find somebody that'll buy it. And so I remember looking at
01:39:53.92 --> 01:39:58.24 what everybody else was doing. They were selling them, you know, like really generic cheap ones for
01:39:58.24 --> 01:40:04.32 like 20 bucks. And I'm like, I want to see if I can start buying it, like 28 and make more profit.
01:40:04.32 --> 01:40:09.28 And so I started at 28 crickets, nobody bought them. Brought it down, waited two weeks,
01:40:09.28 --> 01:40:15.28 brought it down to 24, 99, a couple people bought them. Oh, cool. Got our first sale. And then,
01:40:15.28 --> 01:40:19.36 you know, let it let it hang out there for a bit and then brought it down to where everybody else
01:40:19.36 --> 01:40:24.88 was boom, floodgates open, people are buying these things nonstop and, you know, we're in business.
01:40:24.88 --> 01:40:30.56 And so at that point, I just kept, you know, working it, working it, trying to improve, you know,
01:40:30.56 --> 01:40:35.20 our fighting position or the product found somebody that was an actual machinist that could cut
01:40:35.20 --> 01:40:40.72 them professionally, found a professional powder cutter that could put instead of putting paint on them.
01:40:40.72 --> 01:40:44.48 It actually like powder coat them and you just want to get one of the old snow,
01:40:44.48 --> 01:40:49.60 replace it with paint did one of those. That's what I wanted. My boy. I got like, I've got, like,
01:40:49.60 --> 01:40:57.68 probably a hundred bottle breaches from people give them to me. And we have some that we give away.
01:40:57.68 --> 01:41:04.08 Yeah. And so I have, but I want, I want one that's spray painted with the Narls cut that
01:41:04.08 --> 01:41:09.44 barely works. That's what I was. I saw one last night. Yeah. My boy, my boy, Mike,
01:41:10.88 --> 01:41:18.56 he was the LPO at VBSS before he passed the job over to me and he had, he, we broke out one of the
01:41:18.56 --> 01:41:23.28 old ones. I was like, damn, I was looking at the Dremel Cut Nixon, the crap I cut and I'm like,
01:41:23.28 --> 01:41:29.44 God, I can't believe it. But you know, honestly, I am big on my faith. And I remember that
01:41:29.44 --> 01:41:35.52 point in my life and I was definitely afraid of failing my family. And, you know, I was still
01:41:35.52 --> 01:41:39.84 seeking God in the things in my life. And I was praying. I was like, Lord, how do you want me to
01:41:39.84 --> 01:41:45.12 provide for my family when I get out of the military? And it was funny, man, when he's like,
01:41:45.12 --> 01:41:52.64 beer opens. Well, right, but here's the cool thing, man. You know, they are bottle openers and
01:41:52.64 --> 01:41:58.000 most people use them to open their beer. But, you know, the cool thing is, it's like, even something
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.44 like that, if you give God the glory did, you'd be surprised. Some of the doors he will open
01:42:03.44 --> 01:42:10.80 in your life. So, you know, and it's just, it's crazy, man, because when I told people, especially
01:42:10.80 --> 01:42:15.44 maybe guys, they were like, you like, what are you going to do when you get out? I'm like, hey,
01:42:15.44 --> 01:42:20.88 I'm some of the bottle openers. Jockel, I'm surprised something didn't send me to you. There
01:42:20.88 --> 01:42:26.72 were like, yeah, that's probably not going to work out. And let's get this guy to a psychological
01:42:26.72 --> 01:42:35.28 evil ASAP. But it was cool because within six months, my original goal wasn't to build like a
01:42:35.28 --> 01:42:40.32 multi-million dollar business. It was like, hey, I want to make some extra money for a date and I
01:42:40.32 --> 01:42:46.96 or to save up for, you know, my next firearm or whatever, just some supplemental income. And then
01:42:46.96 --> 01:42:52.16 as it started growing, I was like, do this could be something. And six months into it, we were doing
01:42:52.16 --> 01:42:57.52 $7,500 a month, which blew me away. I never thought we'd even get there. And then at that point,
01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:04.88 I made one of the better moves that I ever made in business. And I sold my chopper. I had a
01:43:04.88 --> 01:43:13.92 motorcycle that I used to drive over to your gym and do the jutsu with. But, um, and I sold the chopper
01:43:13.92 --> 01:43:19.92 and I bought a laser, I took the funds and I bought a laser engraver. And that is when things just
01:43:19.92 --> 01:43:27.60 would be because I was watching an episode of Shark Tank. And, um, these the sharks were tearing
01:43:27.60 --> 01:43:32.32 apart in entrepreneur. Primarily Kevin O'Leary, who became one of my, um, investors. And he's
01:43:32.32 --> 01:43:37.68 he's ripping apart an entrepreneur because this guy, he had decent sales, he had a pretty cool
01:43:37.68 --> 01:43:44.40 unique product. But he had no brand recognition on the product. So like he had the brand on the packaging,
01:43:44.40 --> 01:43:49.44 but as soon as it left, that was the one who was the product. It was like a green neon suit that
01:43:49.44 --> 01:43:55.60 you would wear at a football game or like a ski, you know, like skiing or something, made you stand out,
01:43:55.60 --> 01:43:59.28 right? And the guy, Kevin and Marseille market for that.
01:43:59.28 --> 01:44:06.72 Or for a green neon suit, like a skin type suit, like Spambex suit. Exactly. Yeah. And so the guy had
01:44:06.72 --> 01:44:12.88 he was doing 300k in sales and you know, I've never seen a human in a green neon suit.
01:44:12.88 --> 01:44:17.76 I'd never seen one either, but he had this, he had the sales, he had the product there and
01:44:17.76 --> 01:44:22.48 Kevin, they were looking at it and Kevin's like, you know, he's like, is the brand on on this
01:44:22.48 --> 01:44:27.12 anywhere and the guy's like, no, he's like Kevin just starts ripping him up. He's like, this is the
01:44:27.12 --> 01:44:32.56 dumbest thing that you know, you can do as an entrepreneur. He's like, what if somebody's looking at it
01:44:32.56 --> 01:44:36.48 and outside the package and they want to know who made it, but they can't find your brand on
01:44:36.48 --> 01:44:41.28 there anywhere. They can't go Google it and look it up online. And so I was sitting on the couch
01:44:41.28 --> 01:44:46.64 with my wife Jen and we, because we had two small kids, I was in the Navy still and we were running
01:44:46.64 --> 01:44:50.96 bottle breacher. There wasn't a lot of free time, but we did allow ourselves like that was our,
01:44:50.96 --> 01:44:55.20 like, you know, one show that we'd watch together and I was like, babe, we got to figure out how to
01:44:55.20 --> 01:44:59.28 get boner breacher on each and every one of these units leaving the garage. And so I started
01:44:59.28 --> 01:45:05.28 doing some research which led me to laser engraving. And so I had about $30,000 in the bank from
01:45:05.28 --> 01:45:10.000 like a re-enlistment bonus and I was like, I don't work in the Navy. I don't want to risk, you know,
01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:15.36 our little nest egg on something and unknown, right? And so I was like, I'm going to sell my bike.
01:45:16.08 --> 01:45:20.40 And Cindy, it goes the best place in the world to have a motorcycle. I mean, just the best place.
01:45:20.40 --> 01:45:27.60 And so that was hard for me to do, but I later read Rich Dad Poor Dad with Robert Kisaki and he talks
01:45:27.60 --> 01:45:36.000 about all the time, you know, and he talks about his book, Rich Dad Poor Dad, what the Rich
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:41.04 teacher kids at the Poor Don't. Basically, the summary is, you know, wealthy people teach their
01:45:41.04 --> 01:45:46.16 kids to buy assets, not lab abilities, right? Assets, something that makes you money,
01:45:46.16 --> 01:45:50.48 liability, something that cost you money. And I hadn't read the book at the time, but that was basically
01:45:50.48 --> 01:45:58.16 the move that I made. And, you know, by doing that, our sales went from $7500 at the six month
01:45:58.16 --> 01:46:02.80 mark to a month and a half later we were doing $22,000 a month out of that same one, Car garage.
01:46:02.80 --> 01:46:05.68 To the point where like, I couldn't keep up with it, I had to start like,
01:46:05.68 --> 01:46:10.56 moon, like bringing guys in from the military that were like, you know, doing whatever job
01:46:10.56 --> 01:46:16.08 and they'd have, they'd work in the garage and help me out. And then, you know, I think, you know,
01:46:16.08 --> 01:46:20.72 a year after that point we were doing $80,000 a month out of that one Car garage. And that's
01:46:20.72 --> 01:46:26.56 when I pitched a shark tank. And so you were still on that community when you pitched a shark tank?
01:46:26.56 --> 01:46:31.52 I was. Yeah, I was, I was right at the tail end. Okay. I was right at the tail end and there was
01:46:31.52 --> 01:46:37.76 an open casting called down here in like Miramesa. And I was sitting with one of my advisors in LA and he's
01:46:37.76 --> 01:46:42.64 like, you like, you got to get on that show. And so found it open casting call went down there.
01:46:42.64 --> 01:46:47.92 They were like, hey, first 500 people get to get to pitch to a casting member. And so I went
01:46:47.92 --> 01:46:54.56 gotten line at like one in the morning. I was like number one 25 and then, and then came back the next
01:46:54.56 --> 01:47:01.44 day once I got my little wristband badge and, you know, knocked it out of the park. And then they were
01:47:01.44 --> 01:47:05.68 like within a week. No, within that was on a Saturday Monday morning, they sent me an email.
01:47:05.68 --> 01:47:10.72 They said, hey, we loved your pitch. We need, you have one week to make a video. And I, you know,
01:47:10.72 --> 01:47:16.24 made the video. They loved it. We kept moving on. And it was funny because when you get in that
01:47:16.24 --> 01:47:20.96 process, they assigned you a couple producers and who are kind of coaching you through the process.
01:47:21.92 --> 01:47:26.24 And they were like, it was funny. Me and Jen would have to hop on the phone with them every Friday at
01:47:26.24 --> 01:47:31.04 like four p.m. to have like a conference call with them. How's the pitch going? Where you guys
01:47:31.04 --> 01:47:36.56 at in the process? And it was funny. They were always telling Jen what we would practice our pitch on
01:47:36.56 --> 01:47:41.84 the phone with these guys. And they were like, Jen, Eli is just not excited. You've got to get him
01:47:41.84 --> 01:47:46.88 excited. He sounds like he's not enjoying this. And I'm like, guys, I'm not a cheerleader. Like,
01:47:46.88 --> 01:47:51.28 when I need to get excited like all, but I'm not going to, I'm not going to rob rob rob ross
01:47:51.28 --> 01:47:55.12 just can borrow like I'm going to tell you, hey, this is what we're doing. These are what the sales are.
01:47:55.12 --> 01:47:59.92 This could be something. And but you, you got to keep in mind it's a TV show. So they want you to
01:47:59.92 --> 01:48:06.16 like, you know, they want you to be all. They want that drama, bro. I want that drama. Yeah.
01:48:06.16 --> 01:48:12.96 But anyway, we got, we got an opportunity to go on the show. And we, you know, it went really well
01:48:12.96 --> 01:48:20.56 and got two sharks. Mark Cuban and Kevin O'Leary. And you know, it just, it started blowing up
01:48:20.56 --> 01:48:26.24 and that created another, another leadership challenge to to work through. So then where,
01:48:26.24 --> 01:48:30.72 that once it came out, how much longer did you have in the Navy once the show came out?
01:48:30.72 --> 01:48:39.60 So I actually pitched on the show. I feel we were telling the seal commander this, but I was on
01:48:39.60 --> 01:48:45.04 terminal leave when I pitched. So that's legal, dude. Is it? Yeah, totally. Okay. Well,
01:48:45.04 --> 01:48:51.60 at least as far as I know. I've been out of the Navy now since what since 2014. So
01:48:51.60 --> 01:48:57.44 I, maybe there's a statute of limitations. Hopefully. But anyway, so yeah, I was on terminal leave.
01:48:57.44 --> 01:49:02.88 So I wasn't even going into work, but I went and pitched in LA. And then the show,
01:49:04.96 --> 01:49:10.32 the show actually aired the month after I got out of the Navy, my final, my final month
01:49:10.32 --> 01:49:16.32 in the Navy. So it was like perfect timing for us. And, you know, we started, we started working,
01:49:16.32 --> 01:49:21.12 you know, we started working, you know, the group back to Arizona. We, yeah, as soon as I could
01:49:21.12 --> 01:49:25.52 even, even on terminal leave, I moved my family back there as on a so. What did you get
01:49:25.52 --> 01:49:29.36 did you get a building for production? Like what did you do for that aspect? We did. We, we, we
01:49:29.36 --> 01:49:35.52 we rented space. We rented a couple different spaces. And we just ran it out of there. And it was
01:49:35.52 --> 01:49:42.16 interesting because when you go through that process, there's no guarantee that even if you go to
01:49:42.16 --> 01:49:46.56 LA and you shoot the show, there's no guarantee that your episode's even going to air. So this
01:49:46.56 --> 01:49:52.72 goes right back to kind of like the situation I talked about in my second time, taking those orders,
01:49:52.72 --> 01:49:58.08 coming back to Buds. It was a big risk because at that point we had like $70,000 in the bank
01:49:58.08 --> 01:50:05.36 in our business account. And I remember knowing that, you know, if this show airs, we need a lot more
01:50:05.36 --> 01:50:10.72 inventory, we need more machinery, we need to hire some people. But if it doesn't air, we just waste
01:50:10.72 --> 01:50:15.76 it all of our money. Or we're going to have to figure something out. And so we again, we went big,
01:50:15.76 --> 01:50:21.36 we gambled. We spent every last cent we had at my wife who ran the numbers, who's always around
01:50:21.36 --> 01:50:26.56 the numbers. She was like, hey, if this show doesn't air, we're not going to make payroll. You know,
01:50:26.56 --> 01:50:33.52 so thankfully, it aired when it was supposed to air. And you know, I think we did like $450,000
01:50:33.52 --> 01:50:39.68 that night of the airing. And that was, it would have been way bigger than that. But we got so much
01:50:39.68 --> 01:50:45.44 traffic on the website. I was told it was like 13,000 hits a second because it was like 12,
01:50:45.44 --> 01:50:52.40 12 million people watching the show. And they were like the website crashed within seconds of an
01:50:52.40 --> 01:50:58.40 airing on the east coast. And so thankfully, one of the things that I learned in the teams,
01:50:58.40 --> 01:51:04.08 guys like Jaco was one is none to his one. Always have a backup. So we had a redundancy plan
01:51:04.08 --> 01:51:08.64 in place. We put up a banner on the website. Hey, go to Etsy. We still had our Etsy store. People were
01:51:08.64 --> 01:51:14.48 still able to buy there. And so we limped, limped through it. And then we were all like, yes, this is
01:51:14.48 --> 01:51:20.32 awesome, you know, great exposure, great sales. And then I'm like, now we have to make this stuff.
01:51:21.04 --> 01:51:26.000 Because we don't call it, it's not like we're calling China. Like you know, and so we were before
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:32.16 shark team. We don't call it turnaround here. That's right. That's right. So we were making like 135
01:51:32.16 --> 01:51:36.56 bottle breaches on a good day before shark tank. I think when we woke up the next day, we had to
01:51:36.56 --> 01:51:43.68 make like 60,000 bottle breaches. And we had 20,000 emails to answer and like people are pissed off. Like this
01:51:43.68 --> 01:51:48.96 is the day and age, I am a zombie man. Like, where this little mom and pop shop that was like,
01:51:48.96 --> 01:51:53.20 we're not making with germaltols anymore. But I mean, we don't, we're not making them that fast.
01:51:53.20 --> 01:52:00.72 And so it created a real leadership challenge where, you know, that lesson of, hey,
01:52:01.36 --> 01:52:05.20 what we did yesterday, you can't say this is how we, we've always done it. Because how we've always
01:52:05.20 --> 01:52:08.56 done it and it ain't gonna work anymore. And we got to, we got to think outside the box, we got to
01:52:08.56 --> 01:52:13.60 get creative. And thankfully, I mean, it took me longer than I, I would have liked to have figured
01:52:13.60 --> 01:52:20.000 it out, but thankfully, we finally figured it out. Got things up on step and we're able to handle
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:26.40 national television earrings and stuff like that. And so what year was that? That was 2014.
01:52:26.40 --> 01:52:33.60 How long did it take you to get caught up with 60,000? Making a 335 a day. Three months. Took, took us three
01:52:33.60 --> 01:52:39.36 months and people were pissed, man. The worst part is if some people somehow were finding market
01:52:39.36 --> 01:52:44.72 and Kevin's emails are shark tank investors and they're like, I can't believe you did a deal with
01:52:44.72 --> 01:52:51.92 this company. These guys are idiots, you're stupid. And like, at that point in my life, nothing
01:52:51.92 --> 01:52:58.40 was worse than getting an email from, you know, Mark Cuban, like WTF. You guys need to get this stuff
01:52:58.40 --> 01:53:02.08 straightened out. You know, it was just like, I mean, that's the type of thing that would just
01:53:02.08 --> 01:53:06.88 ruin your night. You know, but, you know, going back to, you just like working for Chris Kyle,
01:53:06.88 --> 01:53:13.92 dude, hey, that don't cut it anymore, man. You know, so I think it's been, I think it was a blessing
01:53:13.92 --> 01:53:19.76 and it's definitely prepared me for what I'm doing now. There's a, I watched, I watched the,
01:53:19.76 --> 01:53:25.76 they have a YouTube video that's like after the shark tank beyond the tank. Yeah, beyond the tank.
01:53:25.76 --> 01:53:30.40 And it was pretty cool. A lyrics, you know, he was talking about you and talking about veterans.
01:53:30.40 --> 01:53:33.68 You could see his a Patriotic guy who's getting like, he's getting choked up talking about what
01:53:33.68 --> 01:53:38.000 you guys were doing and just thankful for your service. So I thought that was, to me, that was
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:44.88 awesome to see because I don't, I don't watch that show. Echo is like, uh, it's big time. Watcher of
01:53:44.88 --> 01:53:48.72 shark tank. Yeah. Did you watch this like when it happened? Life? Oh, you did, you did.
01:53:48.72 --> 01:53:52.40 My boy, dude. In the game, boy. In the game. Yes, over there. Well, yeah.
01:53:54.32 --> 01:53:59.12 Were you nervous before you walked out there? I lived a little bit, but I was more excited.
01:53:59.12 --> 01:54:02.96 I'm not gonna lie to you. I was a little bit nervous because you know, it's like, you know,
01:54:02.96 --> 01:54:10.40 that you're about to either be a hero or a zero on national television. And obviously, too, like,
01:54:10.40 --> 01:54:15.92 all those entrepreneurs, like, they have more, you know, business acumen in their fingers.
01:54:15.92 --> 01:54:21.92 And I did my entire body, but I knew we had something. And I knew that if we could just get on the show,
01:54:21.92 --> 01:54:26.48 obviously it was a controversial product because it was a bullet, you know, by the way. So I was worried
01:54:26.48 --> 01:54:31.76 about that, but it was funny because, um, one of the things that we'd rehears was we were going to
01:54:31.76 --> 01:54:38.000 get each shark their favorite beer. And then, um, you know, hand out the personalized bottle
01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:42.56 breaches that I'd made for each one of them. And then let them, you know, open their beer with it.
01:54:42.56 --> 01:54:48.24 And we're all gonna cheers and whatever. Well, um, last minute, the prop director, guy, he's like,
01:54:48.24 --> 01:54:52.80 hey, we're not gonna use their favorite beers or whatever. We're gonna use these beers that we have
01:54:52.80 --> 01:54:57.28 backstage. And I'm like, hey, you're called, you're show, whatever you guys want to do. And so I don't
01:54:57.28 --> 01:55:02.000 know if somebody was playing a joke on me or what dude, but I went and I, you know, took my bottle
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.68 up, my bottle breacher, I breached it up. And this thing starts foaming all over the place. And I look at it.
01:55:07.68 --> 01:55:12.32 And I'm like, you know, this is like, they're opening their beers. I'm opening, you know, my beer.
01:55:12.32 --> 01:55:17.28 And I'm supposed to cheer up, you know, do the cheers thing. And I was such like, whatever dude.
01:55:17.28 --> 01:55:22.08 Sorry, I just, you know, you know, take a big swing of it. And it was funny because we started
01:55:22.08 --> 01:55:28.64 our pitch and Jen like leans over to me and she whispers to me. She's like, there's beer,
01:55:28.64 --> 01:55:34.32 there's foam in your mustache. And I was like, whatever dude. I just keep trying to make my
01:55:34.32 --> 01:55:40.72 right. Just keep going dude. So we did it, you know, and it was, it was a blessing. And I think
01:55:40.72 --> 01:55:46.24 it's led to, you know, so much, so much other stuff. But, you know, definitely isn't always
01:55:46.24 --> 01:55:52.08 roses. And one of the hardest things about it was working with my spouse. You know, I mean, you know,
01:55:52.08 --> 01:55:57.52 I hadn't even learned to barely live with my spouse at that point because I'd been gone a lot. And,
01:55:59.28 --> 01:56:04.80 you know, we were both kind of like type A's like button heads all the time. And it definitely
01:56:04.80 --> 01:56:11.44 took some learning to what we call staying your swim lane. You know, and like, you do what you do.
01:56:11.44 --> 01:56:16.16 I do what I do. And I'm, and trying not to sleep on the couch. It's been a lot of time sleeping on the
01:56:16.16 --> 01:56:22.08 couch. But, you know, I probably deserved it. So you're talking about the fact that, you know,
01:56:22.08 --> 01:56:29.28 like, with your faith with, you know, you basically a couple times in your life at critical times
01:56:29.28 --> 01:56:34.88 have been praying and saying, hey, look, if I'm supposed to go to Buds, open the door, if not
01:56:34.88 --> 01:56:42.56 close it, you know, I need a way to help my family. If I leave the Navy, open a door, I'm knocking.
01:56:42.56 --> 01:56:48.80 Let me in. Let me, let me, let me know what to do. Yeah. Serious guidance for you. Yeah, it was
01:56:48.80 --> 01:56:55.60 and it was interesting because after after the Shark Tank, and I know there's a spectrum here,
01:56:56.88 --> 01:57:01.60 and I try not to compare myself to other people. But I knew just by knowing myself,
01:57:01.60 --> 01:57:10.16 I knew I wasn't in a good spot mentally. Like, you know, done five deployments, and I got,
01:57:10.16 --> 01:57:17.92 I got now, and I felt this like anger in this rage inside me. And I tried to keep it under wraps
01:57:17.92 --> 01:57:23.36 because like, I, I didn't think it was cool. I didn't want, you know, people to know that like I was
01:57:23.36 --> 01:57:29.36 struggling with certain things. And, you know, and then all the stress of being a dad to young
01:57:29.36 --> 01:57:34.96 kids and, and then running this, running this business with your spouse who you just barely learned
01:57:34.96 --> 01:57:40.000 to, you know, work with. And so I felt like, you know, I was on the struggle bus. I felt like I was
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:45.44 failing as a, as a husband in many ways, and even as a dad. And I was laser focused on this business,
01:57:45.44 --> 01:57:50.32 because I was like, took the same mentality from the seal teams. Like, hey, just go as hard as you
01:57:50.32 --> 01:57:56.32 can outflank your enemy, you know, stand up this team. And, you know, sometimes when your laser
01:57:56.32 --> 01:58:02.88 focused on something, you start dropping other important priorities. And when it really resonated
01:58:02.88 --> 01:58:10.40 with me, like the spot that I was in, probably, probably two years after Shark Tank, I think it was
01:58:10.40 --> 01:58:19.36 2016, a buddy of mine here in San Diego who was in that VBSSL with me, just a good dude. I'm pretty
01:58:19.36 --> 01:58:26.56 sure he's still active. He was an e-dog and then got his commission. And he called me up and usually
01:58:26.56 --> 01:58:32.72 when he called me, it was just to talk shit to me. We called it Bander Therapy. We just, you know,
01:58:32.72 --> 01:58:36.96 tell each other how worthless they were. And we'd laugh about it. And then like it felt like you
01:58:36.96 --> 01:58:43.36 just did like, you know, an hour long intensive therapy session or something. And so I was like,
01:58:43.36 --> 01:58:48.96 oh, here we go. You know, his initials are KP, KP's calling. We're going to, we're going to get
01:58:48.96 --> 01:58:54.56 after each other and then, you know, just catch up see how he's doing. And I could tell immediately
01:58:54.56 --> 01:58:59.44 he wasn't calling to, you know, Bander Therapy, give me a hard time. And he's like, hey man,
01:58:59.44 --> 01:59:04.88 I got bad news. And I'm like, what's up, dude? And he's like, hey man, Chuck is dead. And I'm like,
01:59:04.88 --> 01:59:12.80 what? And he's like, yeah, Chuck is dead. He got killed fighting with the Peshmerga, you know,
01:59:12.80 --> 01:59:18.16 fighting nicest. I think it was yesterday or something. You know, like, I don't remember what else he
01:59:18.16 --> 01:59:23.36 said. But we got, we got off the phone and I was just in shock because Chuck,
01:59:23.36 --> 01:59:29.76 Keating, was one of my new guys at a SILTHING THREE and Delta Blotin. And like, like, I was
01:59:29.76 --> 01:59:36.32 like, as kind of a seed at, you know, like looked after him, just loved the kid, such a such a solid
01:59:36.32 --> 01:59:44.64 dude. And went on to become just a phenomenal seal. But it was, I noticed how I was in trouble because
01:59:44.64 --> 01:59:50.08 I remember walking out of bottle breacher and I didn't, like, I felt like I was getting ready to
01:59:50.08 --> 01:59:54.80 just break down. And I didn't want my staff to see me, you know, break down. I didn't think that
01:59:54.80 --> 02:00:01.20 would be professional. And I remember feeling it, like, I remember feeling the emotion come up
02:00:01.20 --> 02:00:07.20 from my stomach into my throat. And like, our cool, let's just get this out. And it just like stopped.
02:00:07.76 --> 02:00:14.56 And it wouldn't, like, I couldn't, I couldn't shed a tear, I couldn't cry. And this happened
02:00:14.56 --> 02:00:21.68 like, I started walking around the, the, the, the, the, the like mall that bottle breacher's
02:00:21.68 --> 02:00:26.80 buildings are located in. Happened like four or five times and I was like, oh damn, dude, that's kind
02:00:26.80 --> 02:00:33.44 of, that's kind of weird. And I've kind of, it was, it was, it was so weird that I started thinking about it.
02:00:34.24 --> 02:00:39.36 And that was the first time that I'd ever happened. And there had probably been, I don't know,
02:00:39.36 --> 02:00:46.000 to that point, probably 15, at least 15 guys that I knew that had been killed in war.
02:00:46.80 --> 02:00:52.08 And he was out of all of them, none of them were closer to me than him. And it was kind of,
02:00:52.08 --> 02:00:58.08 I was perplexed at why I couldn't mourn him. And so I started thinking about it. And there's a,
02:00:59.92 --> 02:01:06.80 there's a, there's a verse in Proverbs, 423, it says above all else guard your heart
02:01:06.80 --> 02:01:14.000 for, for from it flowed the springs of life. And I realized, I realized it not only had I not guarded my
02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:19.04 heart, but I had built massive walls around my heart to where I couldn't feel anything anymore. I couldn't
02:01:19.04 --> 02:01:23.20 even feel, I couldn't even mourn like one of my best friends, it just got killed fighting ISIS.
02:01:23.84 --> 02:01:30.32 And I knew I was in trouble. And, uh, and the other thing I realized was that that wasn't
02:01:30.32 --> 02:01:38.48 an isolated incident, like it was affecting the, the springs of life that as a father and a husband
02:01:38.48 --> 02:01:44.16 that we're supposed to be flowing out of us so that we can love those around us, especially our
02:01:44.16 --> 02:01:51.68 spouses, our kids, that they were broke, man. That those walls that I built around my heart so that I
02:01:51.68 --> 02:01:57.04 couldn't be heard anymore, like it was affecting. It was keeping some of the arrows of life out,
02:01:57.04 --> 02:02:01.68 but it was definitely affecting that love that was supposed to be flowing out. And I just knew I was
02:02:01.68 --> 02:02:09.20 in trouble. And thankfully a buddy of mine named Rick who loves your show, by the way. He invited
02:02:09.20 --> 02:02:14.08 me to this, this men's retreat. And it was like a Christian men's retreat. And I was like, oh god,
02:02:14.08 --> 02:02:21.12 that sounds awful. Um, but, you know, he kept after me for a couple of years and it's called,
02:02:21.92 --> 02:02:26.80 it was called ransom art. It's called, you know, now it's called Wild It Heart, the guy that wrote
02:02:26.80 --> 02:02:32.40 the book while that hards a guy named John Eldridge. And he writes some phenomenal books, but
02:02:32.40 --> 02:02:36.08 finally I said, you know what, man? I want to be a better man. I want to be a better husband,
02:02:36.08 --> 02:02:40.96 a better dad and, and all of that. So I'm going to go with you. And so I went in, uh, I think it was
02:02:40.96 --> 02:02:48.80 2017 and the event changed my life, man. And, uh, I think the biggest question, biggest questions most of
02:02:48.80 --> 02:02:56.56 us ask theologically are who am I? Why am I here? Why is a world so messed up? What can I do
02:02:56.56 --> 02:03:01.52 about it? And, uh, you know, I definitely got some answers to those questions. And it was cool,
02:03:01.52 --> 02:03:08.000 man. It wasn't like, there was no religion, you know, there was no churchy entity. You would think
02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:12.56 going to event like that, you'd be surrounded by a bunch of net flenders types, but it was just a
02:03:12.56 --> 02:03:20.48 bunch of regular dudes, um, who all came with the same questions that I had. And I think, and I think
02:03:20.48 --> 02:03:24.88 many of them were in the same spot that I was, they hadn't taken care of their heart. They hadn't
02:03:24.88 --> 02:03:33.12 guarded their heart. And, um, in the scripture, it also, um, I think it's 1 Peter 5, 5 8 says,
02:03:33.76 --> 02:03:39.68 be alert and of sober mind for your enemy, the devil, prowls the earth like a roaring line, looking
02:03:39.68 --> 02:03:46.64 for someone to devour. And I have seen a lot of men devour. I mean, we got 22 vets every day
02:03:47.28 --> 02:03:53.52 killing themselves. And that's just the states that report it. And that's just one, that's just one
02:03:53.52 --> 02:04:02.48 area of, of devouring going on. And, you know, it's like, I've always, and I know that not everybody
02:04:02.48 --> 02:04:07.76 believes the same things that I believe. I, I totally get that and I respect that. But I've always
02:04:07.76 --> 02:04:13.76 believed that if, like, if you, if you get something good, and you don't share it with other people,
02:04:13.76 --> 02:04:19.92 if you have a life altering experience, and you don't point others to it, that's pretty messed up,
02:04:19.92 --> 02:04:24.80 and you're not being a team guy at that point. And so I want to share that with people because
02:04:24.80 --> 02:04:30.24 I realize there's a lot of dads out there and a lot of husbands out there and a lot of, you know,
02:04:30.24 --> 02:04:33.84 vets out there and first responders out there that have a lot of questions and they're dealing
02:04:33.84 --> 02:04:39.92 with a lot of stuff. And like me, many of you have tried to like stuff it down like a beach ball
02:04:39.92 --> 02:04:44.72 under the water. And you can hold that beach ball down under the water for a couple of sec, you know,
02:04:44.72 --> 02:04:49.44 couple seconds, maybe even a minute if you're strong like echo over here. But sooner later, man,
02:04:49.44 --> 02:04:55.04 I think it's coming up. And if you don't take care of it, it's going to explode and usually on
02:04:55.04 --> 02:05:04.64 the people that you love the most. Was there, was there, like concrete actions that you took when
02:05:04.64 --> 02:05:11.68 you got home from the retreat? Yeah, there were. The first thing I did was I apologize to my wife,
02:05:11.68 --> 02:05:21.12 the very first thing because I realized just, and this goes back to extreme ownership now.
02:05:21.68 --> 02:05:27.12 I realized how many just how many ways I had failed her, you know, and how she needed me.
02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:34.96 She needed, she needed me to fight for her and off the time. I was so proud, Jaco, and so screwed
02:05:34.96 --> 02:05:40.72 up in so many ways. It half the time I couldn't even apologize to her if I screwed up, man. And I was
02:05:40.72 --> 02:05:46.08 broken and, you know, I needed, I needed fixing. And one of the first things that you need in that
02:05:46.08 --> 02:05:52.72 situation is to realize, hey, man, I'm broken and it's okay to get help. It's okay to seek it out.
02:05:53.76 --> 02:05:59.28 And that's not how team guys are trying to thought. We're taught to BTF, Charlie Mike,
02:05:59.28 --> 02:06:05.44 figured out, keep moving forward. You know, and we're not, we're not, we try and stay away from
02:06:05.44 --> 02:06:13.04 medical. We try and stay away from any of the touchy, feely, emotional stuff because we got stuff to
02:06:13.04 --> 02:06:20.000 do. And that stuff typically not helpful, but I can tell you after going to that, going through
02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:26.88 that ministry and I've been many times now over the last several years, but my marriage, I never
02:06:26.88 --> 02:06:32.96 thought my marriage would be great. I actually have a great marriage now, man. And so much of it was
02:06:32.96 --> 02:06:40.80 because I was equipped to not go back into my own story and get some healing, but also get some
02:06:40.80 --> 02:06:47.92 tools on how to move forward. And just understand the the bigger perspective of this story that we
02:06:47.92 --> 02:06:52.96 live in, man. And you know, it's like one of the things they teach there is that you were given a
02:06:52.96 --> 02:06:58.40 masculine heart for a reason, because you were born into a world at war. And I think a lot of the
02:06:58.40 --> 02:07:03.92 stuff that we see in society has spiritual undertones and foundations to it. And if you don't,
02:07:03.92 --> 02:07:10.24 like if nobody ever teaches you that stuff, man, it's kind of like getting shot at from,
02:07:10.24 --> 02:07:14.64 and you have no idea where you're getting shot at from. There's a lot. I think there's a parallel
02:07:14.64 --> 02:07:20.56 there, but the first thing I did was apologize to my wife. And the second, one of the second things
02:07:20.56 --> 02:07:25.68 that there's another scripture in it, forgive me. I don't remember exactly which one it is,
02:07:25.68 --> 02:07:31.28 but the scripture is I stand at the door and I knock and whoever hears my voice and opens the door,
02:07:31.28 --> 02:07:37.28 I will come in and eat with him and he with me. And that's what I needed, man. I just, I just
02:07:37.28 --> 02:07:43.36 prayed and I gave it up and I said, Lord, I'm broken. I'm hurting on the inside. And I'm inviting you
02:07:43.36 --> 02:07:49.76 into calm, rip all this stuff out of my life and my heart that I don't need that's dragging me
02:07:49.76 --> 02:07:55.92 down and that's not helpful to my family, to those that even trusted me to love and take care of.
02:07:56.56 --> 02:08:02.80 And I need your help and it kind of goes from trying to do it on your own to being like, hey,
02:08:02.80 --> 02:08:08.16 Lord, come in here and help help me with that. And I say that respectfully, man, because again, I know
02:08:08.16 --> 02:08:13.84 that a lot of people don't see things the way I do or feel this, feel the same way, but again,
02:08:13.84 --> 02:08:17.84 I'm not trying, I'm just trying to help other people because I know there's a lot of dudes out there
02:08:17.84 --> 02:08:24.000 asking the same questions that I was asking and they want relief and they want to be well
02:08:24.72 --> 02:08:32.32 and they don't know how to do it. Yeah, well, there's like a route to humility that you're talking
02:08:32.32 --> 02:08:37.28 about and there's a bunch of different routes to humility and I was actually thinking about that
02:08:37.28 --> 02:08:43.52 earlier today, you know, like the one of the, one of the founding tenants of Christy
02:08:43.52 --> 02:08:52.000 Anity is, hey, I'm going to put God above myself. Well, that's, that's, that's humility. To put,
02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.24 you know, I, I talk about humility oftentimes from a leadership perspective, you put the team
02:08:56.24 --> 02:09:02.88 above yourself. You put someone else's plan above your own plan. That's, that's a form of humility
02:09:02.88 --> 02:09:08.80 and extreme ownership is, you can't be, you can't take ownership without being humble enough to say,
02:09:08.80 --> 02:09:16.000 oh, this, this, this, this problem was my fault. So I think, you know, the, the route that you take to
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:21.28 get to a point where you can say, okay, I'm going to be humble. I'm going to look at my life and say,
02:09:21.28 --> 02:09:29.36 hey, hey, wife of 10 years. I'm sorry that I haven't been as good as I can, right? That what,
02:09:29.36 --> 02:09:35.60 what it takes to get you there is, you can, you can take a bunch of different paths to get there,
02:09:35.60 --> 02:09:41.04 but humbling yourself, whether it's before God, whether it's before your team, whether it's before
02:09:41.04 --> 02:09:48.24 your wife and saying, hey, I know I can do better. That's a path that is going to help anybody.
02:09:48.24 --> 02:09:54.24 And, and I think how you get there, there's a bunch of different ways and the result is going to,
02:09:54.24 --> 02:09:59.36 is going to bring you to an area where you are going to find improvement. Yeah, yeah, no, I agree.
02:09:59.36 --> 02:10:06.80 It did not definitely needed to be humbled, you know, and all the guys that are a part of that,
02:10:06.80 --> 02:10:13.12 you know, that ministry, John, Morgan, Bart, man, thank you guys so much for everything you've done.
02:10:13.12 --> 02:10:17.20 Because I know it's not just me, I know that they've helped thousands of dudes through it. And
02:10:17.20 --> 02:10:20.88 if you guys want to go check it out, just go look up, you know, while they're heart,
02:10:20.88 --> 02:10:28.16 I think it's wild at hard.com or whatever, but man, wow, just a life changing experience for me.
02:10:28.16 --> 02:10:33.44 And it really, I went from wanting to build the biggest baddest veteran-owned company in the,
02:10:33.44 --> 02:10:38.32 you know, in the United States to, you know, wanting to focus on my family more.
02:10:38.32 --> 02:10:44.88 And, and also just coming back to, okay, God, you know, you've blessed me with so much.
02:10:45.60 --> 02:10:49.92 How do you want me to spend the rest of my life? Where do you, where do you want me to be?
02:10:49.92 --> 02:10:56.40 What do you want me to, you know, be doing? And now, now here I am, and, you know, doing something
02:10:56.40 --> 02:11:01.68 that I never ever thought I'd be a part of. But I think that's what happens when often you
02:11:01.68 --> 02:11:06.56 turn it over and be like, whatever you want me to do, just open the door. And if you don't want me
02:11:06.56 --> 02:11:13.12 to do it, please shut the door, you know, but I definitely want to spend the rest of my life trying
02:11:13.12 --> 02:11:19.28 to help, you know, help people and, and guide them towards, you know, concrete stuff that actually
02:11:19.28 --> 02:11:30.16 help me. And through that idea of serving, here you are now running for Congress, and Arizona.
02:11:30.16 --> 02:11:38.80 Yeah. What, what? I mean, that's just a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, a massacistic move,
02:11:38.80 --> 02:11:45.60 right, to go and just open up your life, give away your time, give away your privacy, give away
02:11:45.60 --> 02:11:53.28 any semblance of civility from other human beings. Right. And, and here you are, you know,
02:11:53.84 --> 02:12:02.16 you're going for it. Yeah. I am. And, you know, I think we're off, we're off to a good start.
02:12:02.16 --> 02:12:09.44 But I went into this knowing that there was a good chance that, you know, the, the outcome that many
02:12:09.44 --> 02:12:14.56 people, including myself are, are striving towards will not, there's a, there's a, there's a decent
02:12:14.56 --> 02:12:22.16 chance that that outcome will not become a reality. But at the end of the day, I focus on what I can
02:12:22.16 --> 02:12:30.56 control. I focus on a focus on your posture, Eli, don't focus on the outcome. Continue to try and
02:12:30.56 --> 02:12:37.36 be a man of honor and integrity and, and, and more importantly, be a guy that's willing to say,
02:12:37.36 --> 02:12:42.40 okay, I, I may not have all the experience in the world. I may not even be the best candidate,
02:12:42.40 --> 02:12:48.24 but this country is in massive trouble. It's in massive trouble. And I'm willing to go
02:12:48.24 --> 02:12:53.12 serve again. And if you, you all don't want to send me, I'm cool with that. If I'm not, if not,
02:12:53.12 --> 02:12:58.40 if I'm not a good enough candidate, I'm cool with that. What I'm not cool with is sitting on my couch
02:12:58.40 --> 02:13:03.84 complaining about it and yelling at my TV. And I'm not going to be okay. I like to, I don't know if
02:13:03.84 --> 02:13:09.68 you do this, Shaco, but I like to think about sometimes, you know, from a legacy building perspective,
02:13:09.68 --> 02:13:15.20 like, like, I like to think about my funeral, like, who's going to show up? Who's not going to show up?
02:13:15.20 --> 02:13:19.52 What's my, what are people going to say about me when I'm gone? Are they even going to be talk? Are
02:13:19.52 --> 02:13:24.72 they even going to, are they even going to talk about me? Or, or bring up my name and, you know,
02:13:24.72 --> 02:13:30.24 I'm, I'm hoping that at the end of my life, people show up to my funeral and be like, you know what?
02:13:31.52 --> 02:13:38.72 Eli did some, you know, Eli was good dude. And he loved, he loved people, and he wasn't willing,
02:13:38.72 --> 02:13:44.64 or he was, he was willing to sacrifice and serve something bigger than himself. And if, if that's what
02:13:44.64 --> 02:13:51.04 people say about me when I'm dead and gone and six feet under, then to me, I've lived a purpose driven
02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:56.64 life, something that I can be proud of. And to me, that's, that's what this is all about. It's like,
02:13:57.28 --> 02:14:03.20 you and I swore an oath to protect into the fin this country from foreign and domestic threats.
02:14:03.20 --> 02:14:09.20 And right now, I don't, I don't know how you see it. I believe we have some very dangerous foreign
02:14:09.20 --> 02:14:15.20 threats out there, but I think the biggest threats in this country right now are within and the fact
02:14:15.20 --> 02:14:22.40 that we can't, we can't unite and we can't, we have a lot of forces working against this,
02:14:22.40 --> 02:14:30.80 who I don't believe actually want to see a free and prosperous people that still have the power
02:14:30.80 --> 02:14:35.60 where our government is of foreign by the people. But there's a dichotomy to that.
02:14:37.04 --> 02:14:43.28 We have, we're so free and so prosperous here that many of us have become complacent.
02:14:44.16 --> 02:14:49.44 We've checked out. We don't think that we have to participate. And you can't have both. You can't
02:14:49.44 --> 02:14:54.96 have a government and a country that's of foreign by the people and have a complacent people
02:14:54.96 --> 02:14:58.80 that have checked out and don't participate. And I think that's one of the reasons we're in the
02:14:58.80 --> 02:15:03.68 spot that we're in because people don't want to deal with the negativity that goes along with politics.
02:15:03.68 --> 02:15:09.84 They don't want to deal with the nastiness. I totally get it. But that's one of the reasons
02:15:09.84 --> 02:15:15.12 we're in such a bad spot because we just think that we can elect these, these individuals who
02:15:15.12 --> 02:15:20.32 look good and they sound good. They put on the suit with the little flag on the on the collar.
02:15:20.32 --> 02:15:24.32 Tell us what we want to hear and then we leave it up to them and then when they let us down,
02:15:24.32 --> 02:15:32.16 we're like, oh well, I guess there's nothing we can do. No, there is something we can do.
02:15:32.16 --> 02:15:37.76 We can get involved and we can fight for it and that's what it's going to take honestly.
02:15:39.36 --> 02:15:46.08 Was there any issues that was there like a straw that broke the camels back where you said,
02:15:46.08 --> 02:15:54.16 I got to go. I got to do this. Yeah, there was and it was this last election in 2020.
02:15:55.04 --> 02:16:01.60 For so for so many different reasons, it was part the election. What I saw happened in the election,
02:16:01.60 --> 02:16:10.16 but then it was also watching people that I thought were actually eyes wide open,
02:16:10.16 --> 02:16:15.36 willing to fight for us. Do this number. They look left. They look right. Oh,
02:16:15.36 --> 02:16:19.04 I guess nobody else is saying anything. I'm just going to get back in line and you know,
02:16:20.88 --> 02:16:27.44 do my thing and make sure that I don't put myself out there and jeopardize my future political
02:16:27.44 --> 02:16:35.04 career. And so that was that was the big one for me because I believe that there was massive
02:16:35.04 --> 02:16:40.08 fraud in this last election for a bunch of different for a bunch of different reasons.
02:16:40.08 --> 02:16:46.32 At the end of the day, if we have a government that's of buying for the people and yet our elections
02:16:46.32 --> 02:16:50.96 aren't tight and we're not electing. We're no longer electing our officials.
02:16:52.96 --> 02:17:01.92 We're in massive massive trouble and the clock then starts ticking on how long in my opinion we actually
02:17:01.92 --> 02:17:09.92 last. And so I've said this before I'll say it again. I would rather we not. I would rather my guy
02:17:09.92 --> 02:17:18.56 lose or whoever I'm voting for lose, then we don't have to even question. Hey, how legit was that?
02:17:18.56 --> 02:17:22.96 Because I didn't look right over there and that didn't look right. And what about this over here?
02:17:22.96 --> 02:17:26.96 Oh, we're not allowed to talk about this or we'll get kicked off of social media too. Okay.
02:17:26.96 --> 02:17:35.36 Yeah, that doesn't smell right. How about if we have if we the people want to actually audit
02:17:35.36 --> 02:17:44.000 and check the results of our election? What is that look like? Is it welcomed or is it
02:17:44.64 --> 02:17:52.96 or do lawsuits start flying? There's been some interesting stuff going on that are similar
02:17:52.96 --> 02:18:00.56 to what you're talking about. So Jill Rogan, who's I have to explain who Jill Rogan is?
02:18:00.56 --> 02:18:12.000 No, no. Okay. So Jill had these doctors on, talk about COVID and these are doctors that have
02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:19.84 a non-mainstream media view about COVID. And he just released a statement yesterday because now we have
02:18:19.84 --> 02:18:24.80 some of these old rock and roll people telling Spotify if you don't pull Jill Rogan off,
02:18:24.80 --> 02:18:34.48 then we don't want our music off and that's a legitimate thing. So it's like, okay.
02:18:34.48 --> 02:18:38.96 So Rogan came out, he released like a nine minute podcast last night.
02:18:38.96 --> 02:18:44.48 I happen to be driving and when it came out, so I listened to it. And so this is what's interesting.
02:18:44.48 --> 02:18:51.84 I forget the examples that he gave, but one of them was six months ago or a year ago or whatever,
02:18:52.64 --> 02:19:00.72 if you said cloth masks don't do anything, you would be literally banned and there's documented
02:19:00.72 --> 02:19:06.000 people that were banned from social media for saying that. And now it's, oh, it turns out it's
02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:13.44 actually true. And for example, CNN has been widely reporting that. There's a whole list of things
02:19:13.44 --> 02:19:20.96 like that. Oh, here's, here's the, another example is, if you were to say six months ago or a year ago,
02:19:22.24 --> 02:19:28.64 once you're vaccinated, you can't catch COVID and you can't spread COVID. And if you would have said
02:19:28.64 --> 02:19:34.40 that, there's people that were banned from social media for saying those things. And now you look
02:19:34.40 --> 02:19:41.12 up and those things are actually true. They're factually true. That's what's happening. And you get this
02:19:41.12 --> 02:19:51.12 with the, with the election results that you're talking about in 2020. There's, when people said,
02:19:51.12 --> 02:19:56.48 hey, I'm not sure about this election. Right. Some people weren't necessarily saying,
02:19:56.48 --> 02:20:00.80 I mean, there was politicians, there was very few politicians that were saying, hey,
02:20:01.84 --> 02:20:06.24 not so sure about this. Maybe we should hold off. Maybe we should check the results.
02:20:06.24 --> 02:20:12.000 There was personality, social media personalities that were saying that. And they, they got
02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:17.20 shut completely shut down. Right. Not for saying, hey, I think we should overthrow the government.
02:20:17.20 --> 02:20:23.20 But for saying, hey, don't you think we should confirm this because I agree with you that
02:20:23.92 --> 02:20:32.64 to me, the worst outcome for an American election is people look at it and go, I don't believe it.
02:20:32.64 --> 02:20:38.40 Right. Even if it's, even if it's never mind half the populate, I don't want 10% of the
02:20:38.40 --> 02:20:44.24 population to think, hey, I don't believe this is true. I think that that, I think that the
02:20:44.24 --> 02:20:50.08 election results were wrong. I think there was foul play. All those things. What I want to do is,
02:20:50.08 --> 02:20:56.80 if 10% of the people say, or 1% of the people say, hey, we think that there was foul play in the
02:20:56.80 --> 02:21:04.08 elections. I want to say, okay, well, let's get everything out in the table. You know, a good
02:21:04.08 --> 02:21:09.60 analogy would be if you're watching, if you're playing a football game. Yeah. And, you know, a team,
02:21:10.80 --> 02:21:15.76 we think a team got to touch down. And, and the other team says, yeah, that wasn't a touch down.
02:21:16.48 --> 02:21:20.56 You don't say, well, shut up. It was because now we all leave and we don't really think they
02:21:20.56 --> 02:21:24.72 want to. We argue about it. We fight about it. And it's a bad thing. Instead, what do we do? What
02:21:24.72 --> 02:21:30.32 do we do nowadays when there's that problem? We solve the problem by going, oh, you don't think it was a
02:21:30.32 --> 02:21:34.80 touch down? Cool. We're going to go to the video tape. We're going to lay everything out on the table.
02:21:35.36 --> 02:21:42.08 And then everyone can see, oh, yeah, cross the plane. It was a touch down or didn't cross the plane.
02:21:42.08 --> 02:21:49.60 That's it. We can solve the argument so that we actually get the truth out there. And, and it seems
02:21:49.60 --> 02:21:58.48 like with this election, instead of saying, hey, here's what happened in these situations.
02:21:58.48 --> 02:22:03.52 Here's these anomalies that took place. Here's why they took place. Here's the impact that they
02:22:03.52 --> 02:22:07.84 have actually had. Here's some characters that did some things that they shouldn't have done.
02:22:09.04 --> 02:22:12.88 Here's some things that some accusations were made that were totally false. Right.
02:22:12.88 --> 02:22:24.16 But, but to just say, oh, if you don't think that that election was perfect, then you should be
02:22:24.16 --> 02:22:32.16 silenced. And, and the reason I bring up the the the masks and the vaccines is because
02:22:33.20 --> 02:22:39.60 right now, it seems like there are some people that are gathering evidence about the election
02:22:39.60 --> 02:22:47.20 that might not necessarily turn the election over. But they might at least say, hey, this is
02:22:47.20 --> 02:22:52.24 something that happened. This no one no one agrees that this should happen. No one agrees that someone
02:22:52.24 --> 02:22:56.24 should be stuffing ballot boxes, right? No one no one thinks she's been stuffing ballot boxes.
02:22:56.80 --> 02:23:02.48 So if ballot boxes are getting stuffed, what can we do to prevent that? And to me,
02:23:02.48 --> 02:23:13.52 I can't imagine an American that's aligned with America. Like with just the the broad idea of
02:23:13.52 --> 02:23:18.48 America where we have freedom of speech, where the right to bear them said, the bro we have the right
02:23:18.48 --> 02:23:22.40 through life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I can't imagine someone saying, you know,
02:23:22.40 --> 02:23:28.08 I actually think stuffing ballot boxes, okay? I actually think these changing these election laws
02:23:28.08 --> 02:23:34.16 I think that's fine as long as you know it's done for the right party. That to me doesn't make sense.
02:23:35.20 --> 02:23:40.24 So I think when you start talking about the thing that kind of pushed you over the edge,
02:23:41.84 --> 02:23:46.08 I think there's a lot of people that felt that way. Yeah. And honestly,
02:23:47.36 --> 02:23:51.76 there's a long there's a long list of things that I've been watching for years, but,
02:23:51.76 --> 02:24:00.08 you know, I like for instance, you look at this, look at this other board at, right?
02:24:00.08 --> 02:24:06.08 We're getting ready right now to possibly, you know, go send troops over to Ukraine on the eastern,
02:24:06.08 --> 02:24:11.68 their eastern border and yet we don't even take care of our own border, right? We have
02:24:11.68 --> 02:24:16.48 Fittin' all and drugs coming over that southern border. We have human trafficking coming over that
02:24:16.48 --> 02:24:25.04 southern border. You know, we're basically supporting the cartels by doing that. We have MS-13
02:24:25.04 --> 02:24:29.76 gang members coming over that southern border and you have an administration right now that doesn't
02:24:29.76 --> 02:24:34.96 even want to address that problem at all. They're actually taking people in the dead of night
02:24:34.96 --> 02:24:39.84 sometimes and flying them around the country. Right? You had a situation where border patrol agents
02:24:39.84 --> 02:24:44.08 were being fired because they wouldn't take a vaccination yet. People that were coming here
02:24:44.08 --> 02:24:49.12 illegally weren't forced to take a vaccination and then flown all over the country in the dead of night
02:24:49.12 --> 02:24:56.000 so that UNI wouldn't know about it, wouldn't see about it, et cetera. Those are facts as well.
02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:04.64 And so that's just one more issue. How about our debt situation? You've got like close to $30 trillion
02:25:04.64 --> 02:25:13.28 in debt, right? Right now you have Nancy Pelosi and others pushing spending bills that are going
02:25:13.28 --> 02:25:19.52 to continue to rack up that debt and we don't even have the money to pay for it. We're just printing
02:25:19.52 --> 02:25:28.32 money and basically we're devaluing the US dollar and we're causing inflation to skyrocket and
02:25:28.32 --> 02:25:32.72 you have Democrats like the guy I'm running against, guy named Tom O'Hallor and who will try and
02:25:33.36 --> 02:25:39.76 convince you that inflation, it's not that bad or it's, you know, I've even heard in the media
02:25:39.76 --> 02:25:46.08 they'll say, well, Jen Socky said, well, you know, it's an upper class problem, you know,
02:25:46.08 --> 02:25:51.84 and it's like people that are putting gasoline in their cars, people that are buying
02:25:52.80 --> 02:26:00.88 hamburger meat or any of the consumer products that we buy, those prices are going up and up
02:26:00.88 --> 02:26:06.16 and it affects everybody and this idea that we can just print our way out of this mess that we've
02:26:06.16 --> 02:26:11.60 gotten ourselves in because we don't have any fiscal responsibility and we have politicians that want to
02:26:12.56 --> 02:26:16.88 support of, you know, a spending bill so that they can go back to their constituents and say,
02:26:16.88 --> 02:26:23.44 oh, hey, look, I just got you guys, you know, great broadband, you know, wifi or whatever it is,
02:26:23.44 --> 02:26:28.72 but knowing deep down that there were, you know, a thousand other things in that bill that
02:26:28.72 --> 02:26:32.80 wasn't good for the country but now they can come back to hold this trophy up and be like,
02:26:32.80 --> 02:26:38.40 look what I did for you guys, you know, all across the board, how about energy?
02:26:39.12 --> 02:26:44.16 You know, we went from actually having so much energy that we were exporting energy.
02:26:44.16 --> 02:26:51.76 We shut down the Keystone XL pipeline and now we and we greenlit the Russian pipeline at the same time.
02:26:52.48 --> 02:26:58.40 Right. So how's that good for America? We're talking about defunding police officers.
02:26:58.40 --> 02:27:03.60 Are you, are you, what, what, what, what, what, what, what universe are we living in, right,
02:27:03.60 --> 02:27:07.76 where that's a good idea, you know, and I like Jaco, what you've been talking about, hey,
02:27:07.76 --> 02:27:12.48 how about we get, get some of these, you know, police officers, some better training, right?
02:27:12.48 --> 02:27:18.16 I think that's great, but defunding him, ain't gonna help anything. It's gonna, it's gonna hurt
02:27:18.16 --> 02:27:21.12 people and it's gonna hurt people, and it's gonna hurt people, lower class people and minorities,
02:27:21.12 --> 02:27:28.08 more than anybody else. So we've got this country has gone so, in my opinion, it's gone so far backwards
02:27:28.08 --> 02:27:32.96 and so many different, and so many different ways that I look around and one of my favorite
02:27:32.96 --> 02:27:37.52 sayings of all time is evil times when good men do nothing. And so again, it's just like,
02:27:38.08 --> 02:27:42.72 I'll tell you what, if there was, you know, if, if you were running into my district,
02:27:42.72 --> 02:27:47.20 I wouldn't be running into this district, bro. I wouldn't, and matter fact, I'm gonna put you on the
02:27:47.20 --> 02:27:51.84 spot right now. I, because I know I'm not the only one that has asked you,
02:27:51.84 --> 02:27:58.40 Gavin Newsom, there aren't too many guys that could take him out. You could take him out,
02:27:58.40 --> 02:28:02.16 dude, and I know you're building your empire, but I want to put that on your brain, bro,
02:28:02.16 --> 02:28:09.92 because you could take him out. I know you could, yeah, um, I don't think about, like,
02:28:09.92 --> 02:28:15.68 think about the platform that you have, think about your, your reputation and the seal teams.
02:28:15.68 --> 02:28:21.12 Think about what, what you've done as an entrepreneur, and at, at the same time, you've managed to
02:28:21.12 --> 02:28:27.20 keep your family intact, bro. That's, that's big time. I don't know another, I don't know
02:28:27.20 --> 02:28:34.16 another human being that has that all under one roof, man. And so I know you got stuff to do,
02:28:34.16 --> 02:28:40.08 I know you're working on stuff, but you could take him out. You could,
02:28:43.76 --> 02:28:48.24 evil times when good men do nothing, man. And I, and I hate to even, I hate to even put you on the
02:28:48.24 --> 02:28:54.000 spot because nobody's done, nobody deserves to like enjoy the American dream more than you have,
02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:58.48 just with everything you've done. But this is an inflection point in this country. That's why
02:28:58.48 --> 02:29:03.84 echo, that's why you see seven Navy SEALs running right now. Because it wasn't like, hey,
02:29:03.84 --> 02:29:08.000 it wasn't like we got on a conference call. Like, hey, you know, it'd be cute, because if we all
02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:13.28 ran for content, no, no, everybody, they all realized it. I know you, I know you feel it as well,
02:29:13.28 --> 02:29:20.40 but you know, how bad I saw that beat at Al Jaco, you know, the governor of California.
02:29:21.44 --> 02:29:27.44 Yeah. And and look, I appreciate you. Your input on that one.
02:29:29.44 --> 02:29:37.20 I really don't want to go into politics. That being said, I, you know what's interesting is,
02:29:37.20 --> 02:29:42.40 you know, I talked on my friends at live in Texas, they live in Utah, and they live in Montana,
02:29:42.40 --> 02:29:47.84 and they live in Arizona, and you know, there's just been a rash of people leaving California.
02:29:48.80 --> 02:29:53.60 Businesses leaving California. My friends, a bunch of my friends have left California,
02:29:54.32 --> 02:30:03.04 and I love California. California is freaking awesome. It is California has the Pacific Ocean.
02:30:03.04 --> 02:30:08.96 It has the mountains. It has the desert. It has the redwood trees. It has the Ocemedi. It is a
02:30:08.96 --> 02:30:16.40 magnificent place. It is absolutely magnificent. And yeah, it is in a very
02:30:17.76 --> 02:30:24.32 precarious situation right now that I don't think it can, I don't think it can, I don't think it can
02:30:24.32 --> 02:30:32.80 can you go this way. I mean, you, you've seen the news. You've seen the, the homeless situations.
02:30:32.80 --> 02:30:42.08 Yeah. You see the, the trains that we're getting attacked and, you know, robbed from entire free
02:30:42.08 --> 02:30:48.88 trains. I don't know what's going to happen, man. I don't know what's going to happen in California.
02:30:48.88 --> 02:30:56.000 I, I love California. California is an iconic place, and there's, and the other thing
02:30:56.000 --> 02:31:02.08 you got about remember about California is California is not San Francisco and Los Angeles. That's
02:31:02.08 --> 02:31:09.28 not California. Right. That's a small part of California. California is the Imperial Valley. Right.
02:31:09.28 --> 02:31:17.92 California is the agriculture that is the vast majority of this state and hard working Americans
02:31:17.92 --> 02:31:23.36 that are out there busting their ass to make things work. And at the same time, painting incredible
02:31:23.36 --> 02:31:30.72 amount of taxes and having the regulatory environment that's, that's hostile to business, legitimately
02:31:30.72 --> 02:31:38.72 hostile. Right. So with all these things as they continue to add up, I can't predict the future.
02:31:38.72 --> 02:31:43.60 I certainly hope I don't have to get into politics. I, I really just don't know if I have the
02:31:43.60 --> 02:31:52.56 stomach for it. I don't want to do it, man. And, and it's like just the biggest cop out that I can
02:31:52.56 --> 02:31:57.12 throw back at you at this point and, and you and the rest of the guys that are out there
02:31:57.12 --> 02:32:04.64 trying to do it for the right reasons is awesome. Um, man, I don't, I don't want to get into that
02:32:04.64 --> 02:32:10.80 business. I don't want to get into that world. And, you know, when people ask me about politics,
02:32:10.80 --> 02:32:13.76 I always tell them that, you know, I'm not, I don't want to do it unless things can really bad.
02:32:13.76 --> 02:32:18.88 And people hit me up all the time. Is it bad enough yet? Is it bad enough yet? Is it bad enough yet?
02:32:19.92 --> 02:32:26.72 I don't know where that line is for me. I feel a dumb and dumber moment coming on right now.
02:32:26.72 --> 02:32:34.08 Or I just want to say, so you're saying there's a chance. There's a chance. Okay. One at a million.
02:32:34.72 --> 02:32:41.44 Awesome. Uh, don't like it. Um, no, I hear you. I hear you. It's an, it's nasty, man. It's a nasty
02:32:41.44 --> 02:32:47.44 world in its, a caddude. And I, I'm barely even scratching the surface of it, but even now, like,
02:32:48.40 --> 02:32:53.60 I, I don't really like the world. I don't like the self-promotion of going around campaigning
02:32:53.60 --> 02:32:57.60 and telling people why you're so great and why they should vote for you. I don't like that part of it.
02:32:57.60 --> 02:33:03.60 I don't like the nastyness of, you know, people lying, lying about you and trying to smear you
02:33:03.60 --> 02:33:08.32 and, you know, every single way possible and if they can't come up with anything good, they'll just
02:33:08.32 --> 02:33:13.44 make it up. I don't like that part of it. I don't like exposing my family, you know, to this stuff as
02:33:13.44 --> 02:33:20.24 well, I just want my kids to grow up, kind of like a normal life. And, but I'll tell you what, man. It's like,
02:33:20.24 --> 02:33:26.08 if enough of us don't do it, we're done. Yeah. That's the way I see it, man. And I wish I was more
02:33:26.08 --> 02:33:32.16 optimistic, but I watch, like, just like on a, you know, a dope sheet as a sniper man, I watch
02:33:32.16 --> 02:33:38.08 trajectories. I watch where this country started, and more we're at now, man. And it's, I mean, COVID,
02:33:38.08 --> 02:33:45.36 if that doesn't wake people up, you know, to, you know, the fact that often, most often,
02:33:45.36 --> 02:33:51.12 governments aren't typically interested in letting the power rest with the people,
02:33:51.92 --> 02:33:58.08 I don't know what's going to wake people up, but it's, it's getting bad, and we need to,
02:33:58.08 --> 02:34:04.16 we need some sled dogs to put their, uh, and maybe a couple leaders to put their, uh, their
02:34:04.16 --> 02:34:10.48 shoulder to the wheel, but just saying, am I the only one that's ever called him out on, I don't think so
02:34:10.48 --> 02:34:16.64 now. I will say when I speak, maybe not necessarily on the podcast, because it's a small group
02:34:16.64 --> 02:34:21.76 of two or maybe three. Yeah. So yeah, whenever I go and talk to businesses, companies or
02:34:21.76 --> 02:34:27.92 organizations, I'm getting called out almost 100% of the time to get in the game, to get in that
02:34:27.92 --> 02:34:37.36 game, you know, and, and right now, I mean, part of my cop out, part of my, uh, uh, rationalization
02:34:37.36 --> 02:34:42.96 is, you know, I'm trying to build businesses in America, American made business, we're bringing
02:34:42.96 --> 02:34:47.76 manufacturing, we're putting people back to work, we got hundreds of employees, American employees
02:34:47.76 --> 02:34:53.84 that are, that are making things happen. We're, we're bringing back manufacturing. That's, that's,
02:34:53.84 --> 02:34:58.40 it is a part, it's, it is a part of the fight. It's a very important part of the fight. And honestly,
02:34:58.40 --> 02:35:04.32 that's why I'm an America first candidate, not because I, not because I hate, you know, any, any
02:35:04.32 --> 02:35:08.48 other country around the world, but I love this country, and it's for so long, so many of our
02:35:08.48 --> 02:35:13.76 leaders and politicians have put America on the back burner, and they've sold out so many,
02:35:13.76 --> 02:35:18.88 you know, of our workers, our constituents, and it's just like, hey, you know, I'm off
02:35:18.88 --> 02:35:23.76 for, I'm off for, you know, free trade, but it needs to be fair, and we need to make sure that
02:35:23.76 --> 02:35:28.72 we're not shooting ourselves in the foot and shooting, you know, you know, displacing our work
02:35:28.72 --> 02:35:33.44 for us and taking manufacturing away from many of these folks and families that, you know,
02:35:33.44 --> 02:35:38.80 count on it. And that was one of the coolest things about bottle breaches. I couldn't have even
02:35:38.80 --> 02:35:43.36 done it this long. I couldn't have even run that business this long. If I didn't find a way to
02:35:43.36 --> 02:35:49.36 incorporate mission into it. Okay. How do we, how, how is this bigger than just profits and
02:35:49.36 --> 02:35:55.84 balance sheets and okay, so we can support some cool veteran nonprofits, we can hire some vets,
02:35:55.84 --> 02:36:01.44 we can make our products in the USA. Okay. That's enough of a mission to keep me, you know, engaged,
02:36:01.44 --> 02:36:06.32 you know, for a certain amount of time, but, you know, and I love that you're doing that as well,
02:36:06.32 --> 02:36:11.60 man. It seems like it's getting hard to keep up with all this stuff you're doing. Well,
02:36:11.60 --> 02:36:14.24 you, you tell you, you tell you how I'm a bigger challenge, man. You tell you how I'm a bigger
02:36:14.24 --> 02:36:21.04 challenge. So how can everyone help out? How can we help get you elected? Where do we gotta do?
02:36:21.04 --> 02:36:27.12 Yeah. All right. So I appreciate it, man. I just appreciate the opportunity to come and wrap with you,
02:36:27.12 --> 02:36:36.24 guys. If people want to go follow me, they can look up Eli, Eli Crane, underscore CEO on social media.
02:36:36.24 --> 02:36:44.40 If you want to go to my website, it's Eli for Arizona.com. I hate to even ask, but unfortunately in
02:36:44.40 --> 02:36:51.60 this world, so much of this boils down to name ID and for a first time guy in a political race,
02:36:51.60 --> 02:36:57.76 a US Congress race, so much of it is going to come down to do we have the ammo and the resources
02:36:57.76 --> 02:37:03.36 to run all the TV ads, all the digital ads, all the mail ads, et cetera. So if you guys can give us
02:37:03.36 --> 02:37:09.68 a small donation, we would really appreciate it. I'm asking people for prayer as well. You know,
02:37:09.68 --> 02:37:14.08 just for guidance direction and wisdom. And the other thing I'm asking for is that people share,
02:37:15.68 --> 02:37:20.72 you know, share the website, share what we're doing here, so that other people that don't know about it
02:37:20.72 --> 02:37:26.56 can pitch in and help you, so those are the things that you guys can do. Sounds like a plan and
02:37:28.24 --> 02:37:33.28 probably a good place to wrap it up, Eko. You got any questions? We got football questions,
02:37:33.28 --> 02:37:38.08 whatever. I don't want to keep us here too much actually. No, I just actually want to say,
02:37:38.08 --> 02:37:44.000 so when I when we saw the Shark Tank episode, you know how like because you guys watch that
02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:48.56 even before you're on. You know the kind where someone comes out with a product or service,
02:37:48.56 --> 02:37:53.20 and you, you mean it depends on who you are, obviously. And you immediately know like,
02:37:53.20 --> 02:37:57.36 all this guy's going to get a deal. That's why I felt about yours. Because Brad, he but you don't
02:37:57.36 --> 02:38:02.16 want Shark Tank. I've watched it. I mean, I watched your episode over the past like a few days
02:38:02.16 --> 02:38:06.24 when I knew you were coming out here, but no, I'm not a regular watcher. Well, I'm like a bunch of
02:38:06.24 --> 02:38:11.12 other people that moment I saw that thing as a, I was like, did you know what I think about? Did you
02:38:11.12 --> 02:38:16.72 know you lie before that? No, I did. This was back in the days, like in 2014. Yeah.
02:38:16.72 --> 02:38:21.36 Um, but Brad, once I saw that thing, I was like, Brad, that's the cool issue that I ever seen.
02:38:21.36 --> 02:38:25.20 Yeah. You're that guy, bro. Oh, yeah. You're that guy that you was talking about.
02:38:25.20 --> 02:38:31.44 No, dude. I mean, it was so, it was so cool and such a blessing man. And I mean, it's still,
02:38:31.44 --> 02:38:36.80 I tell people all the time, you know, guys don't really grow up. We just get bigger toys.
02:38:37.36 --> 02:38:41.04 Can I tell, can I tell the Southern Franco story? Oh, yeah, it's a real hell of a thing. All right,
02:38:41.04 --> 02:38:47.20 so it's so fun, man. You know, Jaco is who Jaco is, man. And, you know, you got, got people that want to be
02:38:47.20 --> 02:38:53.20 like Jaco, right? And it just so happened that a lot of people, you know, and in task unit two,
02:38:53.20 --> 02:38:58.000 wanted to be like Jaco. So they made us, the older guys made the younger guys do skits.
02:38:58.96 --> 02:39:02.72 And that's a pretty dicey situation, man, because by the way, I know I know where a style
02:39:02.72 --> 02:39:08.40 lives right now. Yeah. I know where he's at. So I might have to go get him. So he's coming, bro. No,
02:39:08.40 --> 02:39:14.56 it wasn't even making fun of you. Really, it was just he was making fun of people that wanted to be like you.
02:39:15.20 --> 02:39:20.96 And so it was funny. So they make you do these skits. And if you piss him off, you know, you deal with,
02:39:20.96 --> 02:39:25.76 you deal with that side of it. But if you make them, if you can make them laugh, while making fun of them,
02:39:25.76 --> 02:39:31.68 that's the, the golden ticket, right? So South was always the funniest dude. So South came up with
02:39:31.68 --> 02:39:38.96 a lot of our skits. And so I remember he did this skit and it was like he was playing you. And
02:39:39.92 --> 02:39:44.32 or no, he was playing, I think he's playing Stoner. And he had this, he had this note, like this
02:39:44.32 --> 02:39:52.24 note, this binder, and he put like, what was it? WWE JD, what would Jaco do? And he like walks out
02:39:52.24 --> 02:39:57.84 playing Stoner, talking like Stoner. He's like, you know, all the acronyms, BTF, Charlie might,
02:39:57.84 --> 02:40:02.32 you know, the guys are just rolling because he's, you know, he's like, you know, making fun of all these
02:40:02.32 --> 02:40:07.76 guys who want to be like Jaco. But our failing misery, and it was just, it was just so funny dude.
02:40:07.76 --> 02:40:12.96 And so, you know, that, that became, you know, a joke, you know, running joke after you left, like,
02:40:13.52 --> 02:40:17.52 got to do all these guys walking around, what would Jaco do? Try to be like, bro, you're not
02:40:17.52 --> 02:40:23.76 Jaco, just be yourself, man. Okay, just be yourself. Big tough frog man, you know,
02:40:23.76 --> 02:40:30.80 our 200 pound ball, all the stuff. Hey, what's Charlie Mike? Continue mission. Oh, yeah.
02:40:30.80 --> 02:40:37.36 It's just another one. And it, and it's an unofficial thing, meaning our status is, this time
02:40:37.36 --> 02:40:40.96 is that we are going to Charlie Mike, meaning it's an unofficial thing, like, we are actually
02:40:40.96 --> 02:40:45.20 continuing to mention, but that turns into just like a, they just Charlie Mike, bro, right? You just
02:40:45.20 --> 02:40:52.88 got to just keep going. BTF, not official. BTF is unofficial. Yeah. Yeah. BTF is unofficial.
02:40:52.88 --> 02:40:57.92 Similar meanings, except for BTF, has, you know, greater capabilities, because it can be used for a
02:40:57.92 --> 02:41:04.56 lot more things than just, just, just, continue mission. So, you know, that's all good. It's all good.
02:41:05.92 --> 02:41:12.40 Eli. Yep. Any closing thoughts? Thank you, man. Thank you for, you know, what you're doing.
02:41:12.40 --> 02:41:16.56 And thank you for allowing a guy like me, you know, to come on this show. Like I've
02:41:16.56 --> 02:41:22.80 listened to this show for, you know, years. And I understand why you, you, you try and keep politics out of it,
02:41:22.80 --> 02:41:27.84 because, you know, I mean, it's such a divisive thing, but I just appreciate you taking a risk and
02:41:27.84 --> 02:41:32.40 bring it, allowing a guy like me to come on and, you know, talk about a little, even my faith, man.
02:41:32.40 --> 02:41:37.36 That's something that can be really divisive to people. And I definitely don't want it to be a
02:41:37.36 --> 02:41:40.80 divisive to people. And I definitely don't want it disrespect, which you've built, but I'm
02:41:40.80 --> 02:41:46.000 grateful that you allowed me to come on and talk about it, because at the end, bro, I do not want
02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:50.96 to be, I never wanted to be in Congress. I don't like Warren suits. I don't want to live in Washington,
02:41:50.96 --> 02:41:57.20 D.C. But I honestly believe if we don't get, if we don't get some men and women with courage
02:41:57.20 --> 02:42:02.64 and character that never wanted this job in the first place in key positions, I'm very concerned
02:42:02.64 --> 02:42:07.60 about what the future for my kids is going to look like. So thank you, man, for using what you've
02:42:07.60 --> 02:42:15.44 built to help guys like me. Yeah. Well, again, thank you. Thank you for what you're doing. Thank you
02:42:15.44 --> 02:42:20.88 for what you did. Thank you for job and the teams, man. That, that counts, bro, like getting after
02:42:20.88 --> 02:42:26.16 getting out there doing that job, holding the line in the teams. Thank you for doing that. And
02:42:26.16 --> 02:42:31.28 for what you did with what you did, what you continue to do with bottle breacher, like that's building
02:42:31.28 --> 02:42:35.12 the American economy. That's made in America. That's freaking outstanding. That's providing
02:42:35.12 --> 02:42:40.40 jobs for people. That's, that's awesome. And, and what you're doing right now going in a politics
02:42:40.40 --> 02:42:48.32 look, I don't like politics. I know you don't like politics. And, you know, I'm not like intentionally
02:42:49.92 --> 02:42:55.04 staring away from politics on this podcast. It's just not the thing that I talk about. No,
02:42:55.04 --> 02:43:00.40 man, and I've had other political people on here. I'll continue to have my, I've had people
02:43:00.40 --> 02:43:06.000 from both sides. I've had Democrats. I've had Republicans on here. People that have run for
02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:12.88 Democratic positions, people that have run for Republican positions, people, and, you know,
02:43:12.88 --> 02:43:17.76 talking about your faith, like, that's, that's a, I mean, I've, that's wide open. You know,
02:43:17.76 --> 02:43:24.88 you can't cover books about the military and not have faith in intertwined in those things
02:43:24.88 --> 02:43:31.44 from people that have, have been to the edge and back. But for me, you know, what I like,
02:43:31.44 --> 02:43:36.80 what I want and what I hope is that when people listen to what we talk about here, they actually
02:43:36.80 --> 02:43:41.60 listen to it. Actually, listen to what people are saying. Yeah. And instead of trying to figure out
02:43:41.60 --> 02:43:47.28 where I don't like you or where I don't agree with you, I try to figure out where I agree with you.
02:43:47.28 --> 02:43:54.32 Where do you have a common goal that that I have? And you want to see America moving the same
02:43:54.32 --> 02:43:58.32 direction that I want to see it? And maybe we have some different ideas about how to get there.
02:43:58.32 --> 02:44:06.000 Yeah. That's okay. That's okay. You know, in a platoon, you ask a pl, you ask every single guy in a
02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:10.56 platoon to come up with a plan for a mission. They're all going to come up with a different way.
02:44:10.56 --> 02:44:14.88 And they're all probably going to think their way is the best way. But guess what? We're all trying
02:44:14.88 --> 02:44:20.24 to do the same thing. And that's what we need to do in this country is look at where we're trying to
02:44:20.24 --> 02:44:27.76 go get on board, support each other, and let's move in that direction. Thanks for coming on, man.
02:44:27.76 --> 02:44:34.80 Thank you. Thank you. And Eli is on his way back to Arizona. And before he left,
02:44:34.80 --> 02:44:41.28 echo Charles, man. You normally aren't quite as hyped to get a picture with someone.
02:44:42.32 --> 02:44:52.64 As you were with Eli, because as far as you're concerned, Shark Tank is, he's a movie star
02:44:52.64 --> 02:44:56.64 for you. Well, or something. You know, you know, you know, but all when you watch them on it,
02:44:56.64 --> 02:45:02.16 you would just happen to watch that life. Like whenever it came out in 2014, you were watching.
02:45:02.16 --> 02:45:07.68 Yeah. So I've seen, I do watch Shark Tank. No, I've seen every single episode. Really? Yeah.
02:45:07.68 --> 02:45:12.32 Yes. How many seasons have there been? I don't know. One million. I don't know. Okay. But it's
02:45:12.32 --> 02:45:17.44 like that today. Like just like how Eli is like where I don't really watch TV, but there is one show
02:45:17.44 --> 02:45:22.80 that me and that's literally the one to show that you like. There's well, my fervo does not
02:45:22.80 --> 02:45:28.56 come on anymore. So yeah. Down to one show. Yeah. There's some other ones that are like cool.
02:45:28.56 --> 02:45:33.44 I'll catch it if it's like the tail end of the night and then whatever, but the one that we do
02:45:33.44 --> 02:45:39.36 watch together every episode Shark Tank. And that was one of them. No, I didn't know him.
02:45:40.16 --> 02:45:44.32 But he was like, you know, I'm a veteran, you know, former Navy SEAL and stuff. So I figure,
02:45:44.32 --> 02:45:50.40 okay, we must know, you know, kind of the same people and just in general. But the thing that
02:45:50.40 --> 02:45:56.000 really was like, I was down for the causes when he showed that thing, man, the freaking 50 caliber
02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:03.36 bottle opener. Come on. I mean, that, you know, was it the cure for cancer? No. But it was the coolest thing
02:46:03.36 --> 02:46:10.80 I've ever seen ever in terms of bottle opener. He'd be able to believe. Yeah. It was really cool. And
02:46:10.80 --> 02:46:15.60 when, you know, after a while, you can tell like, okay, the product alone is such a good idea that
02:46:15.60 --> 02:46:19.84 he, of course, he's going to get a deal. It was like that thought like, yeah, I thought, oh,
02:46:19.84 --> 02:46:23.44 he's going to get a deal. And he got a double. Yeah. He got a double deal. You shark's. That's a big deal.
02:46:23.44 --> 02:46:29.92 Actually, three sharks bid because one other shark said, I'll do a deal right now. And then he
02:46:29.92 --> 02:46:37.84 lies said, hey, just out of respect for the other sharks. I want to make sure that just does anyone
02:46:37.84 --> 02:46:44.16 else have anything to offer. And then the other shark stepped in and made an offer. And then the other
02:46:44.16 --> 02:46:51.76 shark. I don't know all the sharks. That's another little detail. And that's fun. That's
02:46:51.76 --> 02:46:55.92 interesting because I do remember him saying that. But I totally forgot that he was the one who said
02:46:55.92 --> 02:47:02.72 that, which, okay, so I was good was how he framed it. I remember that part. He framed it as not as like
02:47:04.08 --> 02:47:11.04 and actually they made fun of him a little bit because he said he said, he said out of respect for the
02:47:11.04 --> 02:47:15.92 other sharks. I want to make sure that none of you would like to make an offer as well. When
02:47:15.92 --> 02:47:19.68 what he was really saying was, hey, listen to say, if we also want to throw it in the market,
02:47:19.68 --> 02:47:25.36 then the one of the female sharks said, oh, out of respect for us, like she kind of called them on it.
02:47:25.36 --> 02:47:31.60 But he did it right. He did it right. And so good job, you lie. Usually how they say it is kind of like,
02:47:31.60 --> 02:47:36.40 well, it wouldn't be smart for me as a businessman to, you know, just like taking off for the
02:47:36.40 --> 02:47:41.28 first offer. So they they'll frame it something like that. Like, hey, out of out of like my own or
02:47:41.28 --> 02:47:46.08 our business interest money. When he said out of respect for the other that's undeniable right there.
02:47:46.08 --> 02:47:50.80 Because this is what the sharks will do sometimes. Cuban will do this. He'll be like, um,
02:47:50.80 --> 02:47:55.60 do they have their own little methodologies that they use? What's Cuban do? He'll go, if you really
02:47:55.60 --> 02:47:59.92 want to, he'll bully the other sharks. So he'll be like this. He'll go, hey, I'm offering you this
02:47:59.92 --> 02:48:04.08 this, but you got to take it right now. Like he started and I don't want to hear them. If you start
02:48:04.08 --> 02:48:08.80 taking there and he'll totally do it too. He'll be like, well, you know, I should think I should
02:48:08.80 --> 02:48:13.04 hear an offer from and if the one of the other sharks starts talking like, hey, I'll offer you this
02:48:13.04 --> 02:48:18.32 Cuban will be like, I'm out. So they miss it. And now he has kind of a little bit of a reputation
02:48:18.32 --> 02:48:22.32 for doing that kind of stuff sometimes. So now people get really, oh, and they jump at it, you know?
02:48:22.96 --> 02:48:27.60 But if you frame it like, hey, out of respect for the other sharks, you would have to paint
02:48:27.60 --> 02:48:32.56 himself as a bad guy now for him to really follow through. Yeah, it was good. I want to see
02:48:32.56 --> 02:48:38.88 him so respectable. Who you like? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's only a good. It was cool to have
02:48:38.88 --> 02:48:44.64 him on here, man. But definitely cool. And even though he's trying to get me to run for
02:48:44.64 --> 02:48:51.04 freaking governor of California and stuff, I'd have to do a campaign video. Oh, yeah, you can't
02:48:51.04 --> 02:48:59.36 paint a video guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you might even have to work. I really hope it doesn't
02:48:59.36 --> 02:49:04.000 come to that man, but but I give it up for these guys that are out there doing this because
02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:09.04 I look, I can, you know, sometimes people say, oh, I wouldn't like to do that, but you know, they're
02:49:09.04 --> 02:49:13.60 lying. Yeah, you know, they're like, I don't want to have to run for this position. Yeah,
02:49:13.60 --> 02:49:16.64 feeling of the need for them. My country's calling me and you know that they're not telling
02:49:16.64 --> 02:49:20.56 the truth. Yeah, like you can, you lies like, hey, I don't want to do this. You can definitely
02:49:20.56 --> 02:49:26.32 lie like literally does not want to do this. No choice, but at the same time, you can see the passion
02:49:26.32 --> 02:49:33.28 in he knows that we need help. And he's right, he's right, man. He's right, good on him. He came
02:49:33.28 --> 02:49:40.40 at me with the direct approach, which is normally not your recommended approach, but it kind of
02:49:40.40 --> 02:49:47.60 made me think, man, I'm weak over here. Well, yeah, and even if you don't, and this is all in a big
02:49:47.60 --> 02:49:52.48 picture kind of way, this is all just the natural course of things where like if things get too
02:49:52.48 --> 02:49:58.08 extreme and everyone sort of recognize the way this thing, this two extremes, it's going to start
02:49:58.08 --> 02:50:02.32 tipping the other way. Usually when it tips the other way, just like a swing, right? It's going to
02:50:02.32 --> 02:50:08.80 it's going to tip maybe a little bit more, you know, and hopefully it'll settle. Hopefully at some point.
02:50:08.80 --> 02:50:15.76 I am, I am keep waiting for California to start swimming back. And it is, you are starting to see
02:50:15.76 --> 02:50:21.12 indications, right? There was a female mayor up in San Francisco that she just came out and was like,
02:50:21.12 --> 02:50:26.72 alright, we're crushing crime, we're funding the police. And she was, this is in San Francisco.
02:50:26.72 --> 02:50:31.04 This is like a liberal mayor of San Francisco. She started swinging it back the other way.
02:50:31.04 --> 02:50:36.80 Yeah. So that's the, one of the early indications of what's going down. I mean, you see the
02:50:36.80 --> 02:50:42.88 politicians out here just, they did a man at right now. It's what they did today. I don't know,
02:50:42.88 --> 02:50:48.56 but like they got, they put another mask mandate on indoor mask mandate. I mean, meanwhile,
02:50:48.56 --> 02:50:55.20 other parts of the country are wide open for months. Yeah, even the Denver guy. Same deal. Yeah.
02:50:55.20 --> 02:51:00.48 And oh, oh, wide open. England is, England's just saying we're done. We're done with COVID.
02:51:00.48 --> 02:51:05.04 Yeah. Hey, more people are going to get it. We know that. I think Sweden or some,
02:51:05.04 --> 02:51:09.44 somewhere off the, there's places that are just going wide open. Yeah. And Florida's been wide open.
02:51:09.44 --> 02:51:14.72 And Texas, man, I wasn't Texas for a couple years ago. I made it as a couple. Maybe it's like a year
02:51:14.72 --> 02:51:23.44 and a half ago. I did a jujitsu seminar or like a meet and greet at jujitsu. There was 200 people
02:51:23.44 --> 02:51:30.96 there rolling jujitsu. Meanwhile, California was in lockdown, by the way. So that's okay. So
02:51:30.96 --> 02:51:35.36 people are making decisions. But here's that here's, you know, I just saw a picture of the
02:51:36.40 --> 02:51:42.72 newsom who he was just talking about at a football game with a bunch of other politicians,
02:51:42.72 --> 02:51:48.000 none of them wearing masks as they have mandated for everyone else. Yeah. You see,
02:51:48.96 --> 02:51:54.32 you can't get away with that forever. No. You can't, it just doesn't work. Yeah. And that's why
02:51:54.32 --> 02:51:58.72 the pendulum is going to start to swing back. That's what's going to happen. I hope I don't have
02:51:58.72 --> 02:52:04.08 to ride that pendulum to the other side. Yeah. Because I really don't want to. I want to surf.
02:52:04.08 --> 02:52:09.60 I want to do jujitsu. I want to make the podcast. I want to build the companies that were building.
02:52:09.60 --> 02:52:16.08 So and and if we can do that properly, maybe we don't have to get into this whole freaking political
02:52:16.08 --> 02:52:22.08 thing. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, you know, if you're in a bus, we'll say, or fan. So we're in a bus.
02:52:22.08 --> 02:52:29.20 You know what? I feel like that's my political theory. That's your thing. And I don't know about it.
02:52:29.20 --> 02:52:35.20 But like, I think it's got to be, I'm talking chaos. I'm talking, I'm talking, I'm talking
02:52:35.20 --> 02:52:40.24 total mayhem and chaos. And I don't really think I would be in no, I don't, I think it's, I think
02:52:40.24 --> 02:52:49.20 I would become a political leader in an environment when things are no longer the way they were.
02:52:49.76 --> 02:52:57.28 You know what I'm saying? I think I'm, I think I'm more stepping up to a really hostile situation.
02:52:57.28 --> 02:53:00.88 Yeah. That's where I'd get. That's where I grow and hot. Yeah. And in a lot of terms,
02:53:00.88 --> 02:53:07.60 two, we have to remind ourselves that, or remind ourselves of the question of, is it really hostile?
02:53:07.60 --> 02:53:12.000 Or is it just hostile like on the internet? Yeah, you're on the TV or whatever. And I'm not
02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:15.60 to say it is or isn't. I'm just saying that's always a good reminder. And I would tell you that
02:53:15.60 --> 02:53:20.08 there are elements that are hostile in real life. There's definitely elements that are hostile.
02:53:20.08 --> 02:53:26.08 And now, the thing with Joe Rogan was just crazy right now. You know? And the point that he was
02:53:26.08 --> 02:53:34.40 making in this little nine minute episode that he did, I mean, people got banned from Twitter for saying
02:53:35.36 --> 02:53:39.04 masks don't work. Yeah. And by the way, there was people out there wearing three and four
02:53:39.04 --> 02:53:43.52 masks when I was traveling, let's go the airport, there'd be people with two masks on and a
02:53:43.52 --> 02:53:51.04 face shield, right? And okay, hey, cool, go, go do that. But some people were saying, hey,
02:53:51.04 --> 02:53:55.84 this does, how does this work? And you know, the people like dude, it's a piece of cloth over my face.
02:53:55.84 --> 02:53:59.44 How's that stopping anything? And that was just a kind of a common sense approach. Okay,
02:53:59.44 --> 02:54:03.92 we're banned from your band from talking. Even if you're like, it doesn't seem like there's
02:54:03.92 --> 02:54:09.60 does a lot. You're banned from talking. So now, now you talk about those election things. And it's like,
02:54:09.60 --> 02:54:14.56 hey, it doesn't, it seems like these states that were like swing states, there was
02:54:14.56 --> 02:54:20.96 devoting stop. And in the only four like swing states that matter, devoting stop counting at midnight,
02:54:20.96 --> 02:54:25.52 does that seem weird? Yeah. Oh, you're banned. You know what I'm going to say that.
02:54:25.52 --> 02:54:30.08 Yeah. What the right answer should be, hey, that's a good question. Let's do some analytics and
02:54:30.08 --> 02:54:35.28 figure out what happened. Yeah. So, and there's, I, I do know that there's some other
02:54:35.28 --> 02:54:42.64 information that's coming out right now that is definitely, let me rephrase that. There's the
02:54:42.64 --> 02:54:48.80 information coming out about the 2020 election that indicates that maybe things should be looked at
02:54:48.80 --> 02:54:57.04 a little bit more. So, uh, and again, if it's wrong, and it turns out that the election was
02:54:57.04 --> 02:55:00.88 squared away, then cool. You go, okay, cool. Now you all can stop worrying about it.
02:55:01.60 --> 02:55:06.64 All you freaking crazy right wing fringe Trump maniacs can calm down now because look,
02:55:06.64 --> 02:55:12.32 here's the facts. But instead of what they're saying is like, hey, shut up, you're a conspiracy theorist.
02:55:13.04 --> 02:55:17.52 What does it do? What do you do? When you suppress that information, what does it do to those people?
02:55:17.52 --> 02:55:23.28 It embold, it doesn't embolden them. It makes them even more suspicious. You know, and that's not a good
02:55:23.28 --> 02:55:29.52 move. When you won't show the NFL team, the video, they just go, see, they don't know, show
02:55:29.52 --> 02:55:36.24 it's a bad move. Are these things out? Man, what's the worst case scenario? What's the worst case
02:55:36.24 --> 02:55:41.60 scenario? Hey, we got, we got some, we got to fix our elections a little bit. That's, that seems
02:55:41.60 --> 02:55:48.56 legitimate to me. I want to have everybody's vote count. Okay, cool. Don't you? Or do you not?
02:55:49.68 --> 02:55:56.08 Because if you do not, then we have a serious problem with our alignment between us two as human beings.
02:55:56.88 --> 02:56:03.44 I'm American. I think we vote for our people, and that's who gets put in office.
02:56:04.56 --> 02:56:09.20 Don't you think that? You know, and if you don't think that, we have a serious problem.
02:56:09.20 --> 02:56:18.24 And I don't think most Americans, the vast, vast majority, are like, yeah, whoever gets voted,
02:56:18.24 --> 02:56:24.000 that's who should be in office. Cool. We agree on that. We can agree on that. Should the voting
02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:31.68 beast done in a method words kind of standardized and make sense and it's hard to cheat?
02:56:31.68 --> 02:56:38.32 Wouldn't that make sense? Yeah, that would make sense. Okay, cool. Yeah, that instant replay analogy was
02:56:38.32 --> 02:56:44.64 pretty much spot on there because it does like, you know, in football, as the example is,
02:56:44.64 --> 02:56:49.92 the if, you know, usually it's like a touchdown or an out-of-bound scenario, whatever, right?
02:56:49.92 --> 02:56:54.48 Where the line matters, critical moment. Yeah, actually, actually technically it's never,
02:56:54.48 --> 02:56:57.84 it doesn't have to be in a critical moment. Can be the first play they gave? The problem is that
02:56:57.84 --> 02:57:02.08 you only get so many of those calls. You can only go to the video tape a certain number of times,
02:57:02.08 --> 02:57:06.56 and you might not want to waste it if it's like, you know, if you've the first and two,
02:57:06.56 --> 02:57:11.60 yeah, if you ever. I think that's challenging the, yeah, yeah, challenging the rest call. That's,
02:57:11.60 --> 02:57:21.76 that's true. So either way, if the reason that exists is because we do, no matter what team you're
02:57:22.48 --> 02:57:29.04 trained for, Simon, it's just 49ers or the Denver Broncos, whoever, wherever you're trained for,
02:57:29.04 --> 02:57:35.44 you do want to know the truth. Yeah. Like no one wanted, like, if someone didn't make a touchdown,
02:57:35.44 --> 02:57:39.60 it's pretty hard for us to be like, yeah, we should just give them the touchdown, even though he
02:57:39.60 --> 02:57:43.92 didn't make the touchdown, like, that doesn't make much sense. Yeah, and it especially doesn't
02:57:43.92 --> 02:57:47.28 make sense. Even if you're like, well, you know, my team kind of wants, or I just want to let it slide.
02:57:48.08 --> 02:57:52.32 The problem with that attitude, which is understandable, you know, I'm a raging,
02:57:52.32 --> 02:57:57.12 freaking Denver Broncos friend, and it looked like a touch. I think it was a touch. We just need to
02:57:57.12 --> 02:58:03.20 let it slide this time. Here's the problem. You've just now said in place a precedent where we're
02:58:03.20 --> 02:58:07.92 not going to review things. That's what we're, okay. So now we're just going with whatever that
02:58:07.92 --> 02:58:11.44 ref saw that was a weird angle, and he called it a touchdown. So we're good. We're just going to go
02:58:11.44 --> 02:58:14.56 with that for now on. That's not the precedent you want to set. You want to set a precedent,
02:58:14.56 --> 02:58:21.28 like, okay, we have a way of assessing whether this was actually a touchdown or not. And that's what
02:58:21.28 --> 02:58:25.68 we're going to utilize. So you might say, you know what, I really want the Broncos to win,
02:58:25.68 --> 02:58:31.04 and it kind of looked like a touchdown, but the right thing to do for future reference, and for future
02:58:31.04 --> 02:58:36.96 precedents is to say, let's go to the video tape and confirm. But the politicians that said that,
02:58:38.08 --> 02:58:46.88 and a lot of it was tied to the fact that the January 6th event happened. And that made people just
02:58:46.88 --> 02:58:52.88 go, I don't want to, I don't want to catch any flag for what's going on. This is getting crazy. Let's just
02:58:52.88 --> 02:58:59.76 move forward and call it what it is. Looks like they won't go to the video tape. When the video tape,
02:58:59.76 --> 02:59:07.76 we'll make people say, yeah, you know what, the team won. Or, or they say, oh, the team didn't win,
02:59:07.76 --> 02:59:13.60 and now we got some serious issues that we need to attend to. It's very strange times, man.
02:59:13.60 --> 02:59:19.28 It's a very strange time. What's weird? Here's what's weird about this. Is me saying what I just said,
02:59:19.28 --> 02:59:22.40 it seems like pretty normal. It seems pretty logical. Well,
02:59:23.44 --> 02:59:27.28 shouldn't you go to the video tape? No one's going to listen to that and say, no,
02:59:27.28 --> 02:59:34.000 they're going to say, yeah, if that's the rule and you have the data, then why wouldn't you check it.
02:59:34.80 --> 02:59:43.52 But you transfer that exact analogy to the 2020 election and all of a sudden, whoever says,
02:59:43.52 --> 02:59:50.16 hey, maybe we should review the information and the data is a savage, you know,
02:59:50.16 --> 02:59:57.84 insurrectionist, whatever. Well, it's like, no, I'm not an insurrectionist at all. What I want to
02:59:57.84 --> 03:00:05.52 do is review the data. So if someone says that, they get even worse accusations. So it's very strange
03:00:05.52 --> 03:00:09.76 times. So do you, and you mentioned something just a second ago about how in the NFL,
03:00:10.32 --> 03:00:16.72 you only get a few chances to challenge the call. I think I'm not in the NFL. I admit, and it's been a while,
03:00:16.72 --> 03:00:22.64 really, since I've, you know, so that rule could be changed. I don't know. But nonetheless, that was a rule at
03:00:22.64 --> 03:00:28.80 some point. Yeah. And that's for a reason because if there's no limit to, let me challenge every single call
03:00:28.80 --> 03:00:33.04 and jam up this whole system, this whole game, this whole game is 12 hours long now, because I'm
03:00:33.04 --> 03:00:39.28 challenging every call that goes against me. Right? So isn't that part of the game too? Where?
03:00:39.28 --> 03:00:43.28 What's interesting about like the election was people were like, who we don't want to investigate
03:00:43.28 --> 03:00:49.04 everything. We just want to make sure that these key areas that had voting anomalies that are
03:00:49.04 --> 03:00:55.44 documented, maybe we should check those out. Shut up. There. No. Right. So it's almost like a tactic
03:00:55.44 --> 03:01:00.000 where you could, if you're on the other side, right? You could be like, hey, you're just trying
03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:04.08 to stop. You're just what you call. You can't let it go. What were they saying? They were saying,
03:01:04.08 --> 03:01:10.000 like, you can't just accept the truth. It's like that. You know, you want to keep that as an unlimited
03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:14.80 uh, you know, challenging the call. Yeah. You know what? Well, what makes this really scary?
03:01:14.80 --> 03:01:18.80 Well, makes it all that really scary. It's because I haven't dove enough into the details,
03:01:19.60 --> 03:01:24.000 but what makes it really scary is that what just what Joe Rogan just talked about, which is, hey,
03:01:25.12 --> 03:01:30.80 people were getting banned from social media for saying masks didn't work and now it's the reality.
03:01:30.80 --> 03:01:35.76 People were getting banned from social media for saying the vaccine you could still spread COVID
03:01:35.76 --> 03:01:41.60 even if you had a vaccine. And that is actually true. And by the way, people were getting banned
03:01:41.60 --> 03:01:45.36 for saying you could still catch COVID. Guess what? That's true. So all these things,
03:01:46.24 --> 03:01:49.44 we didn't have an open conversation about them because one side got completely shut down,
03:01:49.84 --> 03:01:57.44 which is crazy. So there you go. Can't have an open conversation. That's disturbing
03:01:57.44 --> 03:02:04.72 when you can't have an open conversation. And when what you have to watch out for is people that
03:02:04.72 --> 03:02:12.72 whatever methodology they want to use raised their voice and yell over you. So whether that
03:02:12.72 --> 03:02:18.88 mean, I'm not talking, so could that be, if you and I are in a discussion and you start going,
03:02:18.88 --> 03:02:22.000 I don't care about that. And you start raising your voice and yelling and talking over me?
03:02:22.96 --> 03:02:27.52 Okay, but that's just you and me. I realize you're just mad, whatever, but I didn't get my point
03:02:27.52 --> 03:02:39.68 across, but you don't care because you leave. That, that behavior in social media, that behavior
03:02:39.68 --> 03:02:44.64 in the news, that behavior in mainstream media where, oh, echo saying something I don't like.
03:02:45.20 --> 03:02:51.12 So I'm going to attack him, raise my voice, but through whatever means that might mean,
03:02:51.12 --> 03:02:54.96 you know, retweeting you with hate, calling you this or calling you that or doing a personal
03:02:54.96 --> 03:03:00.72 attack, all that behavior. Now we're not discussing the topic. We're discussing that I hate you.
03:03:04.40 --> 03:03:09.28 You have watched the movie the time machine, you ever heard of it, I didn't watch it, but
03:03:10.80 --> 03:03:18.000 okay, so the time machine is okay, Guy Pierce, who's also the star of Memento, by the way.
03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:21.84 You know, a guy Pierce boom, he makes time machine, he goes away in the future and, you know,
03:03:21.84 --> 03:03:29.04 he finds that humans have split evolutionarily speaking. So they were actually split in three,
03:03:29.04 --> 03:03:33.44 but so one, so he goes with the villagers or whatever and like he says something,
03:03:34.72 --> 03:03:40.32 wait a second, this could have been stargate. Nonetheless, he says something and everything
03:03:40.32 --> 03:03:47.04 a time machine back to before this story. Everyone like turns their back or starts walking away
03:03:47.04 --> 03:03:52.32 or erases what he wrote in his time or something like that. And someone who like somebody explains
03:03:52.32 --> 03:03:57.84 to him, hey, like you can't speak of that, you just can't speak of it. And I think later on they find out,
03:03:57.84 --> 03:04:01.60 like, you know, we're behind and something like that. And that's the thing, what's something you guys
03:04:01.60 --> 03:04:05.76 got to listen to what they say and it isn't ironic that Neil Young's song, keep on rocking in the
03:04:05.76 --> 03:04:12.48 free world. He's like, don't talk anymore. Right, like that's crazy, right? Boy, that's crazy.
03:04:12.48 --> 03:04:16.48 Yep, that's why we have the underdrumped. By the way, we have the underdrumped.
03:04:16.48 --> 03:04:21.76 I'm going around dot com. Why do we have that? Why do we charge $8 and $18 a month
03:04:22.64 --> 03:04:29.28 to have our own little platform that this is why? Because what we're talking about right now,
03:04:29.28 --> 03:04:35.36 this may get rolled, this may get bounced, this may get edited, right? And we're not actually
03:04:35.36 --> 03:04:38.96 making a statement one way or the other. I'm just explaining things that have happened. Yeah.
03:04:40.24 --> 03:04:46.24 I haven't dug through the details enough. I don't spend my time digging through the details of
03:04:46.24 --> 03:04:51.60 current events. I don't do that. That's not, but you know why? Because I'm not that interested
03:04:52.16 --> 03:04:57.52 and because other people that commit their time to them, let these other people go do that.
03:04:57.52 --> 03:05:02.48 I'm going to be reading about World War II, Vietnam, Korea, the Peloponnesian Wars. That's what
03:05:02.48 --> 03:05:06.64 I'm doing over on my side. I'm going to be trying to jitter, hopefully going surfing, playing guitar,
03:05:06.64 --> 03:05:12.56 those are the things that I'm doing. I'm not parsing through the news stories that came out
03:05:12.56 --> 03:05:19.76 in the last 48 hours to try and get you and catch you on something. But when you let a little
03:05:19.76 --> 03:05:24.16 time go by and we talked about this on one of the underground points. So I let time go by and the
03:05:24.16 --> 03:05:29.04 truth starts to rise to the surface. Now it took six to eight months for the truth to rise to
03:05:29.04 --> 03:05:33.04 the surface on some of these stories. But again, you know what's sleep I lost over these stories
03:05:33.68 --> 03:05:38.40 while they were happening? Not very much. I wasn't freaking, I was like, these masks don't work or
03:05:38.40 --> 03:05:41.92 I wasn't like, you better put on a mask. I didn't lose sleep over that. Because I was like, hey,
03:05:41.92 --> 03:05:46.000 it doesn't seem like going to work that good to me. Oh, you know, I'm going to carry on with my life.
03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:53.44 That's what I'm doing. So we don't know when we might get suppressed. So that's why we made
03:05:54.24 --> 03:06:00.64 Joccon around dot com. If you want to, you can help us out. If anything happens to any of these platforms
03:06:00.64 --> 03:06:06.08 that you listen to this on, we will still have that platform. We do an extra podcast on it about
03:06:06.08 --> 03:06:11.36 once a week. And we talk about other things that maybe don't fit quite on Jockel podcast, but we
03:06:11.36 --> 03:06:14.80 want to get them out there too. So you can check that out. If you can't afford it, look, if you can't
03:06:14.80 --> 03:06:22.56 afford it, it's okay. We still got you. You can email, what is it? Assistance at jockel underground.com.
03:06:22.56 --> 03:06:27.92 We appreciate your support on that. You know, also we were talking about American-made companies.
03:06:27.92 --> 03:06:33.60 You know, that's kind of, that's, that's what, that's the way I am trying to help America right now
03:06:34.24 --> 03:06:38.88 by building these companies with the origin team, origin us a dot com. If you need to get boots,
03:06:38.88 --> 03:06:42.000 if you need to get jeans, if you need to get a G, which you probably do,
03:06:43.52 --> 03:06:48.80 then get go to origin us a dot com and by the way, you probably, you may have seen we have a hunting
03:06:48.80 --> 03:06:54.16 line coming out. So we, we're going to be making clothes for hunting. That's what we're doing.
03:06:54.88 --> 03:06:58.96 We've got all kinds of good clothes coming out as well. Work out clothes, by the way,
03:06:58.96 --> 03:07:05.92 echo Charles. So we're going to cover you down on that as well. Origin us a dot com. We also have
03:07:05.92 --> 03:07:14.24 jockel fuel dot com. I'm barely, barely on my game today. Why? I didn't sleep last night. Probably
03:07:14.24 --> 03:07:21.36 got two hours, maybe two and a half. And I've, this is my second jocco discipline go, which is it,
03:07:21.36 --> 03:07:26.48 which is a drink. It's a drink. Could you call it an energy drink? You could because it does have
03:07:26.48 --> 03:07:31.12 energy in it, but when you hear energy drink, you're thinking, oh, oh, you're going to ingest some
03:07:31.12 --> 03:07:35.68 poison that's going to get you a jittery and hyper for about an hour and a half. And then you're
03:07:35.68 --> 03:07:40.72 going to crash and be sick and be diabetic. We're not in that category. No sugar in here,
03:07:40.72 --> 03:07:47.04 sweetened with monk fruit, 95 milligrams of caffeine. Get you on that nice little. You're good to go.
03:07:47.04 --> 03:07:52.64 You're good to go. People say people, if you don't sleep, you don't, it's like, no,
03:07:52.64 --> 03:07:58.08 less than eight hours of sleep is like being a point zero eight. Do you why? You're, you're mentally
03:07:58.08 --> 03:08:03.60 impaired. Look, I'm not saying it's good for you, but it's not as bad as, you know, look, should you,
03:08:03.60 --> 03:08:09.76 get sleep, no, I'm going to get me wrong. Get sleep. Sleep as much as you can. Sleep as much as you want.
03:08:12.08 --> 03:08:18.32 Okay, don't get crazy, but what I'm saying is, if you see a little bit less and you need a little
03:08:18.32 --> 03:08:23.36 swamp hitter, get yourself some jocco fuel, jocco fuel.com. Yeah, that's good. I will also
03:08:23.36 --> 03:08:28.24 contend that even if you got a lot of sleep. Drink because it is good for you. Yeah, it's
03:08:28.24 --> 03:08:33.04 healthy for you. Look, hey, look, some people hate some people drink coffee, right? In the morning,
03:08:33.04 --> 03:08:38.72 good drink coffee, back coffee, whatever you, however you drink coffee. If you get eight hours of
03:08:38.72 --> 03:08:43.68 sleep, what should you not drink coffee? Not necessarily because of kind of good, drink some coffee,
03:08:43.68 --> 03:08:48.96 man. You like that one? You want that as you would say hit or whatever, the reason same deal.
03:08:48.96 --> 03:08:54.000 Mm-hmm. And it's healthy for you. Yep. So boom, you'll be better off either way. Also new tropics in there.
