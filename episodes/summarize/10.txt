that's three to believe in it like you know you're gonna die in addition to the terror and hardships of combat each day brought some new dimension of dread for me I witnessed some new ghastly macrob facet in the kaleidoscope of the unreal as though designed by some fiendish ghoul to cause even the most hardened and calloused observer among us to recoil and horror and disbelief late one afternoon a buddy and I returned from the gun pit in the fading light we passed a shallow deflade we hadn't noticed previously in it we're three marine dead they were lying on stretchers where they had died before their comrades had been forced to withdraw some time earlier as we moved past my buddy groaned Jesus I took a quick glance into the depression and recoil and revulsion and pity at what I saw the bodies were so badly decomposed and nearly blackened by exposure this was to be expected of the dead and the tropics but these marines had been mutilated hideously by the enemy one man had been decapitated his head lay on his chest his hands had been severed from his wrists and also lay on his chest near his chin in disbelief I stared at the face as I realized that the Japanese had cut off the dead marines penis and stuff that into his mouth the corpse next to him had been treated similarly the third had been butchered chopped up like a carcass torn apart by some predatory animal my emotions solidified into rage and to hatred for the Japanese beyond anything I had ever experienced from that moment on I never felt the least pity or compassion for them no matter what the circumstances my comrades would feel stripped their packs and pockets for souvenirs and take gold teeth but I never saw marine commit that kind of barbaric mutilation that the Japanese committed if they had access to our dead like I said it's a glimpse into the darkest part of humanity and I want people to think about that and remember that it's real it's real that dark part of humanity that we don't want to exist it exists evil exists and this is coming from a guy you know when he says that he never had any pity after this again and you if you go and watch the Pacific and you watch interviews with this guy you can absolutely feel like I said the the kindness oozes out of him but even he when confronting the darkness had to explore his own darkness and I'm jumping now to the end on August 8th we heard that the first atomic bomb had been dropped on Japan reports abound for a week about a possible surrender then on 15 August 1945 the war ended we received news with quiet disbelief coupled with an indescribable sense of relief we thought the Japanese would never surrender many refused to believe it sitting in stunned silence we remembered our dead so many dead so many maimed so many bright futures consigned to the ashes of the past so many dreams lost in the madness that didn't gulf us except for a few widely scattered shouts of joy the survivors of the abyss sat hollow wide and silent trying to comprehend a world without war war is brutish in glorious and a terrible waste combat leaves and indelible mark on those who are forced to endure it the only redeeming factors were my comrades incredible bravery and their devotion to each other marine court training taught us to kill efficiently and to try to survive but it also taught us loyalty to each other and love that a spree decor sustained us until the millennium arrives and countries cease trying to enslave others it will be necessary to accept one's responsibilities and be willing to make sacrifices for one's countries as my comrades did as the troops used to say if the country is good enough to live in it's good enough to fight for with privilege goes responsibility and that is another look at war and it's something that we can't ever forget that war is awful and that war is the darkness that I talk about and as Eugene Sledge says the only redeeming factor is the incredible bravery and devotion to each other and I've talked about that before what made war to me an incredibly life-altering experience it wasn't the darkness that I saw but the light of the bravery of those on the battlefield and I will add another redeeming quality to war and it's a question and that is what is the alternative so what if we had not stopped the brutal imperial Japanese empire what if we had not stopped the Nazis what if we had not fought a war against ourselves to enslave and today there's still evil in the world there's still darkness ISIS the cult of child rapists and sadists and torturers and murders and if we don't confront that evil and that evil goes unchecked the darkness prevails and he's admitting that it came to a point where this this did not bother him at all back to the book within a few yards of this scene one of our hospital corpsmen worked in a small shallow deathdevil defile treating Marine wounded I went over and sat on the hot coral by him the corpsmen was on his knees bending over to young marine who just died on a stretcher a blood-soaked battle dressing was on the side of the Marines of the dead man's neck his fine handsome boy's face was asian what a pitiful waste I thought he can't be a day over 17 years old I think God his mother couldn't see him the corpsmen held the dead Marines chin tenderly between the thumb and fingers of his left hand and made the sign of the cross with his right hand tears streamed down his dusty, tanned grief-contorted face while he sobbed quietly obviously again we have a vision in our mind of what a service men is like what a marine is like and certainly that picture of a corpsmen which is actually a navy corpsmen if you don't know navy corpsmen work with the Marines and go into the field with Marines and train as Marines but you picture this navy corpsmen in trying to treat this man and losing him and out there in the middle of the battlefield battle field with tears streaming down his face that's what combat is moving to another section where you're about to see some near friendly fire here it is just then a marine tank took to our rear I'm sorry just then a marine tank to our rear mist took us for enemy troops as soon as my hand went up to drop the round down the tube a machine gun cut loose it sounded like one of ours and from the rear of all places as I peeped over the edge of the crater through the dust and smoke and saw Sherman tank in the clearing behind us the tank fired at 75 millimeter gun off to our right rear the shell exploded nearby around a bend in the same trail we were on I then heard the report of a Japanese field gun located there as it returned fire on the tank again I tried to fire but the machine gun opened up on us as before a surge of panic rose within me in a brief moment our tank had reduced me to from a well-trained determined assistant mortar gunner to a quivering mass of terror it was not just that I was being fired at by a machine gun that unnerved me so terribly but that it was one of ours to be killed by the enemy was bad enough that was a real possibility I had prepared myself for but to be killed by a mistake by my own comrades was something I found hard to accept it was just too much and that is what we call a blue on blue when friendlies shoot at friendlies and fraturicide is what it's called when brother kills brother and you know this is actually the opening of the book that late for my road extreme ownership the opening chapter is about this this happening and happening under my command to my guys when I'm the senior guy and that's why this idea that to be killed by mistake by my own comrades was something I found hard to accept this is the this is the mortal sin of combat and sometimes when I talk about my deployment to Ramadi and what it was like for us okay here's what's going on so I hope at some point I can I can help the military with that now in addition to that as you're trying to knock yourself to this violence and get used to this watch those YouTube videos watch those YouTube videos of street fights of stupid encounters with bars with drunk people and bouncer's with the shoot or don't shoot scenarios with cops military situations where they have helmet cams on and you can see things happening and what you want to do you want to watch those videos I knew I want to pay attention to the people to the humans and watch the reactions and watch their movements and watch their body language and watch their expressions on their faces and see and judge and predict and go to another video and hit pause and say this is what I see right here this is what I think is about to happen and educate yourself on human nature because human nature is what you're going to be dealing with and violence is a part of human nature and sometimes things go violent and sometimes they don't so how do you predict that and if you're unsure which you will be how do you protect yourself first and give yourself the maximum amount of time to make a judgment call so you don't have to rush on top of that it's awesome that you're doing Gjitsu do boxing do moitai do wrestling so you get used to getting hit so you start to see what a person's face looks like when they're about to hit you so you start to see what changes in their their their their posture makes when they're about to throw a punch those are all things that will help you Gjitsu is obviously great for the grinding physical grappling situation but a lot of times hopefully as a cop most of the time you're not in that situation you're standing at a little bit of a distance and or you're you know you've got a little bit more time to judge so fight as much as you can watch those law enforcement and military videos again see the reactions see the noise see the fear see the panic look at people's eyes judge them predict what they're going to do press pause and figure out if you were right or wrong watch horrible violence happen so that you can understand it better so that you can handle it when the time arises so this is kind of becoming a little bit of a chorus when I talk about leading be humble listen learn move methodically when it does come time to make change in a new situation most of the time I would say do it incrementally do smaller changes after you've assessed fully and you've got people a people's opinions and you've expressed and socialized your ideas so you're not trying to roll in there and change the world again now if we go into a hostile turnover situation or there's someone's been fired for cause or that's a different situation but for a normal transition into a new job be humble listen learn and lead that part where you're you're talking about playing out why they're doing the things that the way they are and stuff like that that part can be depending on certain people's personality like if you're coming in as the new guy and you and you ask start asking hey why do you guys do it like this if you come off with the wrong tone sometimes it'll sound like that you're questioning oh for sure you know so sure I remember when I worked at the nightclub we had a new manager and his name was Joel he he came in and he was strangely he was this whole list personified he came in is really friendly but really reserved but the one thing he did kind of to address what I was talking about right really good job he except as no it was my company I belonged in it and nowhere else most Marines I knew felt the same about their companies in whatever battalion regiment or marine division they happened to be in this was the result of or maybe a cause for our strong aspreet a core the Marine Corps wisely acknowledged this unit attachment men who recovered from wounds and returned to duty nearly always came home to their old company this was not misplaced sentimentality but a strong contributor to high morale a man felt that he belonged to his unit and had a niche among his buddies whom he knew and with whom he shared a mutual respect well didn't combat this sense of family was particularly important in the infantry where survival and combat efficiency often hinged on how well men could depend on one another a spree decor and now there's a section that I'm moving forward to and this section is called the stench of battle the sun board down on us like a giant heat lamp occasional rains fell on the hot coral merely evaporated like steam off hot pavement the air hung heavy and muggy everywhere we went on the ridges the hot humid air weaked with the stench of death a strong wind was no relief it simply brought the horned odor from an adjacent area Japanese corpses lay where they fell among the rocks and on the slopes it was impossible to cover them usually there was no soil that could be spated over them just the hard jagged coral the enemy dead simply rotted where they had fallen they lay all over the place in grotesque positions with puffy faces and grinning buck tooth expressions it was difficult to convey to anyone who is not experienced it the gassly horror of having your sense of smell saturated constantly with the putrid odor of rotting human flesh day after day night after night this was something the men of an infantry battalion got a horrifying dose of during the long protracted battle such as pelaloo in the tropics the dead became bloated and gave off a terrific stench within a few hours after death whenever possible we removed marine dead to the rear of the company's position there they were usually laid on stretchers and covered with ponchoes which stretched over the head of the corpse down to the ankles I rarely saw a dead marine left uncovered with his face exposed to the sun rain and flies somehow it seemed indecent not to cover our dead often though the dead might lie on the stretchers for some time and decompose badly before the busy grave registration crews could take them for burial in the division cemetery near the airfield added to the awful stench of the dead of both sides was the repulsive odor of human excrement everywhere it was all but impossible to practice simple elemental field sanitation on most areas of pelaloo because of the rocky surface field sanitation during maneuvers in combat was the responsibility of each man in short under normal conditions he covered his own waste with a scoop of soil at night when he didn't dare venture out of his foxhole he simply used to empty grenade can't destroy a ration cans and threw it out of his hole and scooped over it the next day if he wasn't under enemy fire that was not possible on pelaloo added to this was the odor of thousands of rotting discarded japanese and american rations at every breath one inhaled humid air heavy with countless repulsive odors I felt as though my lungs would never be cleansed of these valve vapors as I looked at the stains on the coral I recalled some of the eloquent phrases of politicians and newsmen about how gallant it was for a man to shed his blood for his country and to give life's blood for sacrifice and so on the word seemed so ridiculous only the fly is benefited so as patriotic and brave as Eugene sledge was the madness the madness even made him begin to question what this was all about and think about what these politicians would say and say that only the fly is benefited it's crazy how he went so detailed in the in the smells because you know when you watch movies and that's a part that you don't do it but if someone puts on head gear you know with a face mask and a whole nine yards shin guards and padded out fit on and people can attack them and you have to react to it the other good thing to do is do it in a situation where you know you don't let the guy know what's gonna happen you know he's got to keep his eyes closed until you say go when he opens his eyes there's someone there where the knife right in front of a fake knife right in front of him is gonna stab when he's got a draws weapon and shoot or defend himself somehow so you want to hit him with these unexpected drills with your weapons without your weapon shooting and moving so those those are those are the kind of things as soon as you get the opportunity to do it and I think what's important here is this is he's not a new leader like newly commissioned leader stepping up in the ranks he's in a new organization so he's stepping into a new organization is the new leader in a new situation we've kind of talked about stepping up from within the organization how are you going and stepping into a new organization now I'm gonna look at this from a perspective of like a normal transition into a leadership position and a new job or something like that not a hostile takeover situation maybe we can address that on a later time but not a situation where hey they fired this guy he had a bad reputation the things are going wrong you're gonna step in and change it because that that would take a different leadership approach then the one that I that I would take and that I have taken where you're stepping into a situation where things are going okay so I think if that can be clarified that you're not like questioning it because it seems like you know I want to make it seem like you know I know a better way right off the bat you don't want that tone you know but you don't know so be humble and check yourself you gotta be friendly to people but at the same time you gotta be reserved now this is this is tricky because you are trying to build relationships you absolutely are trying to build relationships that's what life is that's what business is that's what war is that's what everything is about building relationships with these other humans so you want to be friendly to people but at the same time from a leadership perspective you can't just come in and be Mr. Nice guy and best friends with everybody that's not gonna work out for you for a couple reasons number one you don't know the the face that people are gonna present you out of the gate is not necessarily the true face of that person so you may check in your first day and this guy so you start asking yourself how am I being perceived right now if you can just occasionally start asking yourself how am I being perceived right now how is echo singing me right now so all the sudden you you start to take other people's perspective which is it's a good start because it's not your own and the goal is to get outside of your own perspective and see yourself from some kind of a distance so you start asking yourself how am I being perceived and then start trying to watch yourself like what do I look like right now am I caught inside that madness and once you start to do that that's going to be like your that's going to be your little tool that you're going to use is getting outside and just watch yourself and saying
