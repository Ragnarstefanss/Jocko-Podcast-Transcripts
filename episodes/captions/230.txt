00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000 This is Jocco podcast number 230 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, echo.
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.000 Good evening. Operation Rolling Thunder began in 1968. As we flew combat missions striking
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000 Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara's hand-selected targets, we lost planes and men almost every day.
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000 Fying from Yankee Station, the area of the Gulf of Tonkin where the aircraft carriers operated,
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000 we learned what it was like to sit in a wardrobe and a wardrobe table surrounded by empty chairs.
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000 Half the time, we never knew what happened to them.
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000 Maybe another pilot noticed an enemy surface to air missile launch or caught a fleeting glimpse of a burning American plane
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000 heading toward the jungle below. Sometimes we'd hear the air crew requesting help on the ground,
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000 dodging enemy patrols and calling for rescue. When the helicopters went in,
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000 the North Vietnamese were often waiting. They shot up the helicopters and their escorting planes.
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000 We sometimes got our man and lost three more in the process.
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:28.000 We were flying not just for each other. We were flying for each other's families.
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000 The man on your wing usually had a wife, maybe some children.
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000 You took care of him to take care of them.
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000 We all faced moments where we risked our lives for each other to ensure the contact teams
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000 did not knock on our brothers' door back in San Diego, Lamor, or would be island.
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000 When the enemy scored, the families were devastated.
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000 You seldom see that written about, but we've all come home to tell widows and fatherless kids
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000 how sorry we were. We gave them what peace we could.
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000 We've never seen that last night.
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000 It warps the rest of their lives as they wrestle with the pain.
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000 That old adage, time heals all wounds.
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000 No.
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:38.000 Fifty years on, I've seen those families still break down in tears as they talk of their fallen aviator.
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000 You don't get over that kind of pain.
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000 You just learn to live around it.
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000 It becomes part of who you are.
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000 And for us out on Yankee Station, that grief motivated us to sacrifice for each other.
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000 Not everyone could hack it.
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000 There were days on Yankee Station where I watched air crews lose their nerve.
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000 The sudden some mechanical mysterious issue came up and a flight had to be scrubbed.
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000 Sometimes it happened when the same plane was on the catapult ready to launch.
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000 They just couldn't bring themselves to face it.
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000 Again, the most fearsome air defense network in the world,
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000 erected by the North Vietnamese with Russian help around Hanoi.
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000 On rare occasions, some men turned in their wings and went home rather than face that crucible again.
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000 It was easier to fly for an airline.
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000 In three years, the Navy lost 532 aircraft in combat,
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000 including other operational losses associated with that war, the Navy had 644 aviators killed,
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000 missing or taken prisoner of war.
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000 The total fixed wing aircraft losses of the Navy Marine Corps and Air Force together exceeded 2,400.
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000 Of course, it was intensely personal.
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000 Darryl Gary lived with nine guys in two houses on the beach in La Jolla when he went through training.
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000 After the first trip to Yankee Station, six came home.
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000 Worse, we were losing the larger war.
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000 Destroying the targets given to us by the Pentagon seemed to make no difference in the war to the south.
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000 The losses mounted, and the migs started seeking us out.
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000 The North Vietnamese possessed a small but well-trained air force,
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000 proxied by their Chinese and Soviet allies.
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000 As good as it was, they were not in the same league as the Soviet Air Force,
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000 so in shanked shock waves through the Navy when North Vietnamese pilots started shooting us down.
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000 During the Korean War, the North Korean Air Force was virtually wiped out in the opening months.
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000 A decade later, the Vietnamese migs gave us a real fight.
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000 They shot down one of ours for every two migs that we claimed.
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000 We considered that lost rate intolerable, given our long history of deeply one-sided kill ratios.
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.000 In World War II, US Naval Aviators crushed the Japanese in the central Pacific on the way to Tokyo with Hellcap pilots
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:44.000 who scored three-force of the Navy's air to air victories, posting a kill ratio on the order of 19-1.
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000 In Vietnam, we were simply not allowed to win.
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000 So the Navy bureaucracy did what bureaucracies do best.
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000 It continued on course.
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:06.000 Micro-managed from Washington, DC, we made the same mistakes month after month.
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:16.000 In January 1969, a plane-scope-spoken carrier-skipper named Frank Alt wrote a report to the chief of naval operations,
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000 detailing deadly flaws in our fighter tactics and weapon systems.
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000 His list of complaints was a long one, and the Navy decided to act.
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000 Unfortunately, many in senior commands were more about their careers than about fixing the problem.
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000 By approving the creation of an air combat post-graduate school, which we quickly named Top Gun,
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000 they gave the appearance of doing something to change things.
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000 President Johnson and Secretary McRenair's leadership, the Navy bureaucracy,
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:02.000 seemed more interested in appearing to solve problems than risking failure by actually trying to solve them.
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:14.000 They gave the leadership of Top Gun to a relatively junior officer, me.
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000 And that right there is an excerpt from the opening of a book called Top Gun, an American story,
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.000 by a man named Dan Peterson, a retired Navy captain, fighter pilot,
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000 Vietnam Air Combat Veteran, and the first officer in charge of the story,
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:44.000 the story, the story, the Top Gun, the Navy fighter weapon school.
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000 And it is an honor to have Dan with us here tonight to talk about his experiences
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000 and share some of his lessons learned.
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000 Sir, thank you so much for coming on.
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.000 And because it is Top Gun, I am woefully unqualified to speak with any experience on air combat,
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000 also joining us is my friend from Ramadi and my colleague from National On Front Dave Burke,
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000 who has been on this podcast more times than anyone.
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000 Who served as a fighter pilot in the United States Marine Corps Top Gun instructor,
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000 Top Gun Senior instructor, Ford Air Controller with us in Ramadi on the ground.
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000 And pilot of the F-18, the F-16, the F-22, and the F-35.
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000 So I figured I'd bring someone you could actually talk to, sir.
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000 That's great.
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000 So you know, you go through some of this stuff in the book,
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000 but I want to just kind of lay the groundwork of where you grew up.
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000 I know you were born in Illinois.
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000 What was your childhood like?
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000 And I want to take us through childhood up through where you were in the Navy
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000 and then we'll get back into the book.
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000 This is, uh, earliest, met real memories.
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000 The end of the Second World War.
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000 My dad had been in Europe, sliding for four years,
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000 and came home and his job was already filled.
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000 Move down to California.
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000 Came to Riverside, California.
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.000 And he worked as a puttin' pipeline in Palm Springs during that period of time.
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000 I was going to school and working a couple of jobs and making,
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000 making ends meet, guys.
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000 And that's where I grew up.
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000 Then I went to Wittier.
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000 And the draft came breathing on everybody,
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000 the follow on draft for Korea.
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:50.000 And I joined the Navy Reserve and listed guy.
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000 How old were you when you joined the Navy Reserve?
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000 I don't know, probably 17.
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000 Just right there.
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000 And did you associate the Navy with aviation?
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000 Yeah.
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000 So you kind of knew, you know,
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000 Juckoh, how I got started really.
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000 I was in a little sit guy and I messed up.
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000 There are NES lots of automatos.
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000 It was pretty busy basing those days.
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000 A lot of World War II props, corsairs.
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000 And I was a Mac.
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000 That's when I trained to be.
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000 It was a Mac.
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000 And I was mentored by a chief named Brown.
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000 During that time, I learned to mess up.
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000 It saved my life for all of me out of the Galle.
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000 And I got out on the flight line,
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000 started carrying the man's toolbox and getting his coffee
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000 when he wanted.
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000 And he taught me a great deal about it.
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000 And what really turned me on got me going.
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000 This is too thin.
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000 It's quickly.
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000 There was the lieutenant doing a test flying in that squatter.
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000 And we were the first quarter and get jets.
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000 And we had some two seaters.
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000 TV, two's.
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000 M.T. backseat.
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000 Every time I'd work on an engineer playing go through flight test.
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000 And a person at Lutin says, you know, empty back seat is a waste.
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000 Come on, go with me.
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000 And I flew with him in the backseat.
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000 Maybe five, six, seven, eight times.
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000 And I was hooked.
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000 You know that feeling.
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000 David.
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000 Yes.
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000 You know. And so I started flying with him.
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000 And he quickly said, you're natural.
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000 You know, you're pretty good at what he said.
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000 And I'll arrange for the exams.
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000 And we'll do a physical on it.
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000 We'll go to Pensacola.
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000 I said, right on.
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000 And I was working two jobs and sleeping in my car.
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000 Going to college at time.
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000 So it was a perfect time for it.
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000 And coming to one of the last weekends I spent with those guys.
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000 In comes Z. Cormere and the blue angels.
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000 And he had a small smile on me.
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000 So I watched the blue angels fly.
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000 And there was a cutless David.
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000 Put on a, I can't read Billy Phillips.
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000 Whoops have me? obscene what Stanley Phillips is doing?
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.74 �� What's this and Matthew Phillips set me up to make you
00:12:35.74 --> 00:12:40.24 going to adjective for something good tonight?
00:12:40.24 --> 00:12:41.74 That'sfor me, keep you up.
00:12:41.74 --> 00:12:43.46 Yes, we haveledge of truth.
00:12:43.46 --> 00:12:45.62 We haveledge of truth.
00:12:45.62 --> 00:12:47.34 His story that Beth choke said about Charlie and I
00:12:47.34 --> 00:12:51.08 did not obviously listen to him so that they're killer,
00:12:51.08 --> 00:12:52.40 remember so that he wouldn't take me Rat Moyni,
00:12:51.90 --> 00:12:54.000 knows to know who Grabbed the Rice?
00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.88 Cadet program, you know, and I got to tell you more about when we talk about the squadron.
00:13:00.88 --> 00:13:02.60 It was the first fighter squadron.
00:13:02.60 --> 00:13:03.60 Got it.
00:13:03.60 --> 00:13:06.24 With the five aces.
00:13:06.24 --> 00:13:09.40 The old guys from the second world war are getting out.
00:13:09.40 --> 00:13:12.92 Young guys like me were the future ones.
00:13:12.92 --> 00:13:18.76 Yeah, the other thing I always like to think about when we talk about, you know, the past
00:13:18.76 --> 00:13:20.24 wars.
00:13:20.24 --> 00:13:23.12 You getting into a jet.
00:13:23.12 --> 00:13:26.04 What kind of jet was it that the with young was going to be to.
00:13:26.04 --> 00:13:28.60 So you get into a TV too.
00:13:28.60 --> 00:13:30.60 This is like science fiction.
00:13:30.60 --> 00:13:36.80 I mean, the state of technology and you're whatever, 18 or 19 years old and you're going
00:13:36.80 --> 00:13:41.44 into the most modern high speed aircraft ever created.
00:13:41.44 --> 00:13:42.44 That's right.
00:13:42.44 --> 00:13:43.44 That's right.
00:13:43.44 --> 00:13:47.32 And there was a there weren't any passenger jets in those days.
00:13:47.32 --> 00:13:53.24 Probably a DCA tour being invented here in San Diego.
00:13:53.24 --> 00:13:56.56 And it was the first Jedi had ever been in.
00:13:56.56 --> 00:13:58.36 That was an e-ticket ride.
00:13:58.36 --> 00:13:59.64 First time.
00:13:59.64 --> 00:14:02.64 So I'm going to go back to the book here.
00:14:02.64 --> 00:14:04.72 You get down to Pensacola.
00:14:04.72 --> 00:14:05.72 And you say this.
00:14:05.72 --> 00:14:10.64 I Pensacola, we flew the S N J. Texan and the T 28.
00:14:10.64 --> 00:14:14.04 On my first morning there, our drill sergeant woke us up in the barracks with the
00:14:14.04 --> 00:14:18.24 rattle of his nightstick along the seal frames of our bonks, then double time to sound
00:14:18.24 --> 00:14:21.36 to an aging hanger beside the sea plane ramp.
00:14:21.36 --> 00:14:25.72 In the very same building where some of Naval aviation pioneers established our tradition
00:14:25.72 --> 00:14:29.16 to drill sergeant smoked us with 40 minutes of PT.
00:14:29.16 --> 00:14:31.08 Each morning started with the same ritual.
00:14:31.08 --> 00:14:36.12 We worked out in the hanger amongst the ghosts of those who had paved the way for us.
00:14:36.12 --> 00:14:40.48 Thanks to them, Naval aviation became the rebel branch of the service.
00:14:40.48 --> 00:14:45.24 We were always striving to develop new ideas, new technology, and new ways of fighting that
00:14:45.24 --> 00:14:48.88 would send the age of the battleship into history.
00:14:48.88 --> 00:14:53.32 From the battles of the coral sea and midway to the great Marianne's Turkey shoot, they
00:14:53.32 --> 00:14:58.88 transformed the US Navy into the most effective Naval fighting force on the planet.
00:14:58.88 --> 00:15:02.08 Everywhere we went in Pensacola, we felt that tradition and it was an honor to be
00:15:02.08 --> 00:15:04.20 invited to be a part of it.
00:15:04.20 --> 00:15:08.12 Would my generation contribute to perpetuate in the years ahead?
00:15:08.12 --> 00:15:12.96 One thing for sure, I was not going to be the one who washed out and went home to be just
00:15:12.96 --> 00:15:18.20 another college kid with ductal hair, working odd jobs to cover tuition.
00:15:18.20 --> 00:15:22.40 Where other cadets bought cars and spent time in town drinking a trader John's another
00:15:22.40 --> 00:15:26.92 local aviator watering holes I made a point of staying on base.
00:15:26.92 --> 00:15:31.56 My dad's ethic became mine and you talked a lot about your dad's work ethic in here.
00:15:31.56 --> 00:15:33.20 I studied in work hard.
00:15:33.20 --> 00:15:37.76 I was determined to be among the top cadets upon graduation who would be handed the
00:15:37.76 --> 00:15:42.32 keys to the latest and greatest fighter jets are country produced.
00:15:42.32 --> 00:15:46.24 After basic school of Pensacola, we required to take a cross country instrument flight
00:15:46.24 --> 00:15:51.92 to California, the final stage before we advanced to school in Beville, Texas.
00:15:51.92 --> 00:15:55.64 The fringe benefit of this last evolution was a chance to visit home.
00:15:55.64 --> 00:15:58.72 Now here's the caveat that I always need to make when I read these things.
00:15:58.72 --> 00:16:01.76 I'm just skipping giant parts of this book.
00:16:01.76 --> 00:16:05.32 The amount of detail, the stories that you're telling the characters that you're bringing
00:16:05.32 --> 00:16:10.08 out in this book throughout the book are just awesome.
00:16:10.08 --> 00:16:15.76 It's a historical gem just to be able to read it.
00:16:15.76 --> 00:16:20.28 But I'm not going to read the whole thing on the podcast and people need to buy the book
00:16:20.28 --> 00:16:23.000 if they want to get all that out of it.
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.36 There's an audio book as well.
00:16:25.36 --> 00:16:30.08 Either way, you need to read the whole book in order to get this.
00:16:30.08 --> 00:16:35.28 But this, you felt that and I went to our officer candidate school down in Pensacola
00:16:35.28 --> 00:16:43.24 and they have the amazing naval aviation museum there, which is one of the best, I think
00:16:43.24 --> 00:16:45.68 it may be the best museum I've ever been to.
00:16:45.68 --> 00:16:49.88 I've heard the World War II museum in New Orleans is equally awesome, but I haven't been
00:16:49.88 --> 00:16:51.20 there yet.
00:16:51.20 --> 00:16:57.44 But you just felt that heritage as a guy going through OCS.
00:16:57.44 --> 00:17:06.44 You know, just to be selected for something like that, I've been done reasonably well
00:17:06.44 --> 00:17:14.20 in school academically and to be allowed to go down there.
00:17:14.20 --> 00:17:20.000 And you know, you guys are all pros at working out every day.
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.40 They marine die, tallest and new discipline, every day in their whole hangar.
00:17:27.40 --> 00:17:30.68 He worked us and then we'd run.
00:17:30.68 --> 00:17:38.56 And then we'd go to the, what you call it, the course, you know, the obstacle course.
00:17:38.56 --> 00:17:45.60 obstacle course and all the things I've seen it in the SEAL video as a movies and it was
00:17:45.60 --> 00:17:48.16 a ton of life.
00:17:48.16 --> 00:17:54.36 But when you make a commitment to go and it didn't take long and Pensacola to find out
00:17:54.36 --> 00:18:00.28 how you got to go to the first team in the first team be a great fleet squad and a
00:18:00.28 --> 00:18:01.60 care.
00:18:01.60 --> 00:18:04.52 You got to have the great.
00:18:04.52 --> 00:18:09.88 So the motivation was there and it was fun.
00:18:09.88 --> 00:18:14.32 Now did everybody in your flight school want to be, want to get jets?
00:18:14.32 --> 00:18:16.12 Was it just 100% competition?
00:18:16.12 --> 00:18:17.12 Yeah.
00:18:17.12 --> 00:18:22.44 I had a roommate named Malklaid's, Marine, Marine pilot.
00:18:22.44 --> 00:18:29.16 I pinned his wings on, he pinned my wings on the daily finish and he was a great football player
00:18:29.16 --> 00:18:32.36 Orange County high school.
00:18:32.36 --> 00:18:33.80 And we went in together.
00:18:33.80 --> 00:18:40.16 We were roommates all the way through and he decides to go Marine Corps for the last
00:18:40.16 --> 00:18:41.16 minute.
00:18:41.16 --> 00:18:53.08 But we both found we're going to go and score well and we knew we'd get fleet squad.
00:18:53.08 --> 00:18:58.12 You know, a real piece of the history out of that into my logbooks.
00:18:58.12 --> 00:19:04.76 They hadn't seen anybody to a fleet squad or not of Beville in about a year.
00:19:04.76 --> 00:19:07.72 I got the first set of orders.
00:19:07.72 --> 00:19:13.60 It was worth it.
00:19:13.60 --> 00:19:18.68 I was just talking about from the book when you had to do a cross country instrument
00:19:18.68 --> 00:19:19.68 flight to California.
00:19:19.68 --> 00:19:25.28 This gave you a chance to go home and you mentioned this in the book.
00:19:25.28 --> 00:19:31.72 Mary Beth stood on the tarmac looking up at me with my parents at her side.
00:19:31.72 --> 00:19:37.32 She was a vision in an Angora sweater and below the knee skirt.
00:19:37.32 --> 00:19:41.68 And flat healed shoes and with her hair down she had a smile on her face.
00:19:41.68 --> 00:19:44.80 Maybe just a hint of awe as well.
00:19:44.80 --> 00:19:47.56 I could hope.
00:19:47.56 --> 00:19:51.76 I unstrapped and climbed out dressed in a khaki flight suit, a matching jacket and navy
00:19:51.76 --> 00:19:53.72 issued chuck of boots.
00:19:53.72 --> 00:19:57.20 I barely made it down the ladder when she wrapped her arms around me.
00:19:57.20 --> 00:20:01.12 In an instant, the year of separation seemed like an eye blink.
00:20:01.12 --> 00:20:07.20 I knew beyond a doubt this was the woman I wanted to marry.
00:20:07.20 --> 00:20:09.16 But you fast forward a little bit all too soon.
00:20:09.16 --> 00:20:10.48 The beautiful interlude ended.
00:20:10.48 --> 00:20:13.20 My instructor met me at Al Toro a few days after Christmas.
00:20:13.20 --> 00:20:17.96 I wore the ring on my right hand as I kissed Mary Beth goodbye on the ramp she had given
00:20:17.96 --> 00:20:19.60 you a ring.
00:20:19.60 --> 00:20:22.04 Soon I would be an officer in a gentleman.
00:20:22.04 --> 00:20:25.32 I'd ask her father for permission to propose.
00:20:25.32 --> 00:20:27.88 We'd start a life together in the navy.
00:20:27.88 --> 00:20:33.88 A final hug, no tears and I scrambled up the ladder and into the con cockpit.
00:20:33.88 --> 00:20:39.52 As Bill Pearson and I taxid out to run away, I saw her waving goodbye to her naval aviation
00:20:39.52 --> 00:20:40.68 cadet.
00:20:40.68 --> 00:20:44.56 When I landed at Beville, my first jet fighter waited me on the flight line.
00:20:44.56 --> 00:20:50.96 She was a grummin, pff, f-9 f- Panther, a well-traveled aircraft whose dark blue aluminum
00:20:50.96 --> 00:20:55.16 skin was dotted with patched over bullet holes.
00:20:55.16 --> 00:21:00.20 Like my instructor, she was a veteran of Korea, her paint dulled by years of service,
00:21:00.20 --> 00:21:06.000 either straight wing and sub-mock-one top speed the Panther had been relegated to state-side
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.16 pastures where she helped train the next generation of naval aviation.
00:21:13.16 --> 00:21:16.96 Was Korea over at this point or was there a chance that you were still?
00:21:16.96 --> 00:21:17.96 No.
00:21:17.96 --> 00:21:18.96 So what year was this?
00:21:18.96 --> 00:21:23.36 Um, 1955 and 50, uh, 56.
00:21:23.36 --> 00:21:24.36 Okay.
00:21:24.36 --> 00:21:26.88 56 so it would have been a B-ville.
00:21:26.88 --> 00:21:27.88 Fine.
00:21:27.88 --> 00:21:29.88 So Korea's well over at this point.
00:21:29.88 --> 00:21:34.36 But you still got these pilots, your instructors are straight up combat vets.
00:21:34.36 --> 00:21:36.20 Well, from Korea.
00:21:36.20 --> 00:21:38.20 And they were good.
00:21:38.20 --> 00:21:40.000 Very, very good.
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.12 They were the best.
00:21:43.12 --> 00:21:48.52 This section that you talk about flight school and again, there's so much in this book
00:21:48.52 --> 00:21:54.52 to cover, you know, it was a challenge for me to figure out where I wanted to spend
00:21:54.52 --> 00:21:55.52 time.
00:21:55.52 --> 00:21:57.40 You talk about flight school.
00:21:57.40 --> 00:22:02.88 You have a great section in there about when you make mistakes and you have failures
00:22:02.88 --> 00:22:08.20 and what your attitude was and your attitude was, okay, I messed this up.
00:22:08.20 --> 00:22:10.16 What do I need to do to fix it?
00:22:10.16 --> 00:22:15.52 And you know, you had that attitude of taking ownership of things and then doing the
00:22:15.52 --> 00:22:17.32 hard work to get it done.
00:22:17.32 --> 00:22:26.76 I've heard your books and looked at some of your programs and when you play in the league
00:22:26.76 --> 00:22:34.88 as a possible naval avid or and you make a commitment to finish as a same as a program
00:22:34.88 --> 00:22:37.48 you guys went through.
00:22:37.48 --> 00:22:41.64 And I'm talking about the training, okay.
00:22:41.64 --> 00:22:47.28 And you're dealing human life each other's everyday fine.
00:22:47.28 --> 00:22:48.76 Failures unacceptable.
00:22:48.76 --> 00:22:49.76 You do.
00:22:49.76 --> 00:22:51.32 You make a mistake.
00:22:51.32 --> 00:22:56.36 And this mistake that's in the book, it may have to do with a very old,
00:22:56.36 --> 00:23:02.48 navigation system but we were required to be proficient at it.
00:23:02.48 --> 00:23:10.88 And I got confused in the weather one day and made a mistake went back and flew that
00:23:10.88 --> 00:23:15.72 check right again and out of 18 months of training.
00:23:15.72 --> 00:23:18.12 That's the only time that happened to me.
00:23:18.12 --> 00:23:22.12 But it was unacceptable to fail.
00:23:22.12 --> 00:23:32.20 Guys, that's what I'm telling you and I wanted, I wanted to be a naval avid so bad.
00:23:32.20 --> 00:23:42.24 So well, on March 1st, 1957, I got my wings.
00:23:42.24 --> 00:23:47.60 When my orders arrived, I tore open the envelope running through my worst case scenarios.
00:23:47.60 --> 00:23:55.000 The first of which was blimp's, yes, the 1950s Navy still flew airships.
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.36 We called them poopy bags.
00:23:57.36 --> 00:24:02.96 Nobody wanted to go from flying panthers and t-birds to puttering around at 70 knots with a
00:24:02.96 --> 00:24:05.52 gigantic bag of gas over your head.
00:24:05.52 --> 00:24:06.80 No thank you.
00:24:06.80 --> 00:24:09.40 Then there was an ASW anti submarine warfare.
00:24:09.40 --> 00:24:15.56 This meant multi-engine flying and and in terminally long patrols over open ocean where
00:24:15.56 --> 00:24:18.84 everybody aboard tried not to fall asleep.
00:24:18.84 --> 00:24:23.80 I took a breath, looked down on my orders and read the official Verbiage Directing Me
00:24:23.80 --> 00:24:27.96 to report in 30 days to San Diego.
00:24:27.96 --> 00:24:29.12 I read it twice.
00:24:29.12 --> 00:24:31.56 Then a third time just to be sure I wasn't dreaming.
00:24:31.56 --> 00:24:37.28 I was going to a squadron known as VFAW III.
00:24:37.28 --> 00:24:40.000 V stood for heavier than air.
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.80 No blimps for me.
00:24:41.80 --> 00:24:44.60 F stood for fighters.
00:24:44.60 --> 00:24:47.80 AW stood for all weather.
00:24:47.80 --> 00:24:49.16 I done it.
00:24:49.16 --> 00:24:52.36 I was going to be a jet fighter pilot.
00:24:52.36 --> 00:24:56.84 I was on the road to top gun.
00:24:56.84 --> 00:25:02.000 How many guys from your group ended up making it to jets to fighter jets?
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000 Two.
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.84 I'll close when I.
00:25:04.84 --> 00:25:05.84 My rooming.
00:25:05.84 --> 00:25:06.84 Wow.
00:25:06.84 --> 00:25:10.32 He went to Makah.
00:25:10.32 --> 00:25:16.80 Oh, down in a flu FJ Fiery's at down on Miami Beach.
00:25:16.80 --> 00:25:20.72 Opa Laka was the name of that base, down in the Marine Bay.
00:25:20.72 --> 00:25:25.12 I went home to Merrimar in San Diego.
00:25:25.12 --> 00:25:31.48 The same state as my Murray-Beth, which was when I got to be honest among them was
00:25:31.48 --> 00:25:32.88 with part of my motivation.
00:25:32.88 --> 00:25:34.32 I wanted to be back.
00:25:34.32 --> 00:25:36.52 I miss her a lot.
00:25:36.52 --> 00:25:40.68 And suddenly in the middle of the book, there's 16 photos.
00:25:40.68 --> 00:25:46.24 Some of the airplanes that you described, Joko, and a couple great pictures of Beth and
00:25:46.24 --> 00:25:47.24 I.
00:25:47.24 --> 00:25:48.68 Yeah, particularly her.
00:25:48.68 --> 00:25:53.40 And what's nice is they put together the use-collar, full-collar photographs.
00:25:53.40 --> 00:25:54.40 Yeah.
00:25:54.40 --> 00:25:57.000 I can tell you, you had a lot more cloud rolling into your book publishing.
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.88 You can look at the first edition of my first book has a bunch of crappy black and white
00:26:02.88 --> 00:26:04.52 photos on bad paper.
00:26:04.52 --> 00:26:07.28 Look at the full glossy scenario going on.
00:26:07.28 --> 00:26:12.68 Thanks to the first top-good movie.
00:26:12.68 --> 00:26:14.44 So we're going back to the book here.
00:26:14.44 --> 00:26:18.60 My first act as an ins and the US Navy was to buy a car.
00:26:18.60 --> 00:26:22.12 My gang of new officers at lunch for the first time at the officers club in Corpus Christi
00:26:22.12 --> 00:26:25.36 Texas decided, at least one of us needed to have a set of wheels.
00:26:25.36 --> 00:26:28.44 We rolled the dice to see you would go down to the dealership and I lost.
00:26:28.44 --> 00:26:35.36 I picked out a brand new 1957 Ford Fairlane, Raven Black with black and colonial white
00:26:35.36 --> 00:26:39.88 matching interior, sidewall straight out of American graffiti.
00:26:39.88 --> 00:26:45.08 I drove home from Texas to in my new ride, eager to see Mary Beth, make a men's and
00:26:45.08 --> 00:26:46.44 take her for a spin.
00:26:46.44 --> 00:26:50.60 I had 30 days of leave before I needed to report and I intended to use every minute
00:26:50.60 --> 00:26:53.28 of it counting my girl.
00:26:53.28 --> 00:26:57.40 But morning after I got home, I went to meet with Mary Beth.
00:26:57.40 --> 00:26:59.36 You didn't write, she said.
00:26:59.36 --> 00:27:02.12 I didn't get any letters for a while.
00:27:02.12 --> 00:27:05.40 I was about to explain when she said, Dan, I'm seeing someone.
00:27:05.40 --> 00:27:10.16 When you didn't write, well, he was persistent and I gave in.
00:27:10.16 --> 00:27:11.28 I didn't know what to say.
00:27:11.28 --> 00:27:13.36 He was a football player at college.
00:27:13.36 --> 00:27:16.72 They've been seeing each other for a few weeks.
00:27:16.72 --> 00:27:21.80 And you know, I talked about, well, you talk about it in the book when the training was
00:27:21.80 --> 00:27:22.80 really hard.
00:27:22.80 --> 00:27:26.72 Obviously, you had to prioritize what you were going to focus on.
00:27:26.72 --> 00:27:30.44 Even though you wrote Mary Beth every night, when the training got to a point where you
00:27:30.44 --> 00:27:34.12 had to focus more on the training, you didn't write for some time or sometimes you didn't
00:27:34.12 --> 00:27:35.12 write.
00:27:35.12 --> 00:27:39.44 And that was the little break in the opportunity for this football player.
00:27:39.44 --> 00:27:52.24 It was when I had the one navigation flight failure and it rocked my foundation.
00:27:52.24 --> 00:27:57.96 And I missed a couple weeks of writing to her otherwise for 18 months when written back
00:27:57.96 --> 00:28:02.76 and forth every day, except for that period of time.
00:28:02.76 --> 00:28:08.44 And a beautiful young girl going to college and she was pretty popular girl.
00:28:08.44 --> 00:28:09.44 Yeah, yeah.
00:28:09.44 --> 00:28:13.96 Damn football player.
00:28:13.96 --> 00:28:17.68 You're up against some tough competition.
00:28:17.68 --> 00:28:19.000 But you have to drive on.
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.80 You go to North Island at North Island, the guard at the front gate gave me directions
00:28:22.80 --> 00:28:25.60 to VFAW III.
00:28:25.60 --> 00:28:32.36 The squadron's executive commander was a guy named Commander Eugene Valencia.
00:28:32.36 --> 00:28:37.88 Round face and solidly built with thinning hair, my new exo happened to be the third highest
00:28:37.88 --> 00:28:43.72 US Navy Ace of World War II, one of the great legends of our community.
00:28:43.72 --> 00:28:52.52 In one engagement over the Japanese home islands in 1945, he shot down six enemy planes.
00:28:52.52 --> 00:29:00.20 He finished the war with 23 flags on the side of his F6F Hellcat.
00:29:00.20 --> 00:29:06.28 The man introducing himself to me held the Navy Cross and six distinguished flying crosses.
00:29:06.28 --> 00:29:08.64 I was in awe.
00:29:08.64 --> 00:29:12.08 Yet Commander Valencia was anything but arrogant.
00:29:12.08 --> 00:29:16.20 He greeted me and set me at ease with his relaxed, honest, zooming nature.
00:29:16.20 --> 00:29:20.56 It was hard to believe that a man with so many accomplishments could be so grounded and
00:29:20.56 --> 00:29:22.56 approachable.
00:29:22.56 --> 00:29:27.20 It was exactly that.
00:29:27.20 --> 00:29:29.80 And did you know this going into the room?
00:29:29.80 --> 00:29:30.80 Oh no.
00:29:30.80 --> 00:29:31.80 I had.
00:29:31.80 --> 00:29:34.88 I had no background on the fighter squadron.
00:29:34.88 --> 00:29:44.72 He was one, the skipper, the squadron was Howard A. D. who flew and found the Japanese fleet
00:29:44.72 --> 00:29:46.60 to battle the midway.
00:29:46.60 --> 00:29:48.76 He was a commanding officer.
00:29:48.76 --> 00:29:50.56 And there were four other racers.
00:29:50.56 --> 00:29:54.72 The famous Texo Niel was in that fighter squadron.
00:29:54.72 --> 00:30:00.24 He talked about walking in the ready room and you knew you're pecking order.
00:30:00.24 --> 00:30:03.32 And these guys were bigger in life.
00:30:03.32 --> 00:30:05.76 What does it take to become an ace?
00:30:05.76 --> 00:30:06.76 You got to get five.
00:30:06.76 --> 00:30:07.76 You got to get five.
00:30:07.76 --> 00:30:09.76 I've made the number.
00:30:09.76 --> 00:30:12.56 And he became an ace and he shot down six planes.
00:30:12.56 --> 00:30:16.16 And one day.
00:30:16.16 --> 00:30:18.52 How long did it take you to start putting this together?
00:30:18.52 --> 00:30:20.16 I mean, these guys were in their dress uniforms.
00:30:20.16 --> 00:30:22.12 Are you looking at this guy's rack of ribbons?
00:30:22.12 --> 00:30:24.96 Seeing that he's a Navy Cross or something?
00:30:24.96 --> 00:30:26.60 You know, most of it.
00:30:26.60 --> 00:30:29.68 Most of it's done at the bar.
00:30:29.68 --> 00:30:39.52 And there's a bar in North Island called the Ibar, which the Saces, they control the place.
00:30:39.52 --> 00:30:42.08 And they had their own bartender.
00:30:42.08 --> 00:30:46.08 And once and a while you get invited to go with them.
00:30:46.08 --> 00:30:49.12 And a good, good, volentious story.
00:30:49.12 --> 00:30:51.48 I hit it off with the old man.
00:30:51.48 --> 00:30:55.12 I flew with him as I said, wasn't the best.
00:30:55.12 --> 00:30:56.76 But I got enough.
00:30:56.76 --> 00:31:02.28 I got enough for a really to pick up on his ammo.
00:31:02.28 --> 00:31:05.40 How he operated during combat.
00:31:05.40 --> 00:31:07.64 A lot of about tactics.
00:31:07.64 --> 00:31:11.16 He and Texan, the only guys.
00:31:11.16 --> 00:31:14.40 They were mentoring us.
00:31:14.40 --> 00:31:20.12 There were five incidents eventually in that year in that squatter.
00:31:20.12 --> 00:31:25.20 And we had all the 50, 60 airplanes I think.
00:31:25.20 --> 00:31:26.88 Four different kinds.
00:31:26.88 --> 00:31:28.52 All the flight time.
00:31:28.52 --> 00:31:30.76 David, do you ever, ever find yourself?
00:31:30.76 --> 00:31:32.32 We had all the flight time.
00:31:32.32 --> 00:31:35.88 He could physically and.
00:31:35.88 --> 00:31:38.60 I don't ever remember flying too much.
00:31:38.60 --> 00:31:39.60 Yeah.
00:31:39.60 --> 00:31:41.60 Well, just.
00:31:41.60 --> 00:31:45.60 And we, they all mentored us.
00:31:45.60 --> 00:31:46.44 I started.
00:31:46.44 --> 00:31:48.64 I went to first day of hook.
00:31:48.64 --> 00:31:50.76 First day of hook.
00:31:50.76 --> 00:31:52.12 Convention.
00:31:52.12 --> 00:31:57.08 And what I did with I carried this brief case full of scotch.
00:31:57.08 --> 00:31:59.28 And that's the instance mission.
00:31:59.28 --> 00:32:00.28 Yeah.
00:32:00.28 --> 00:32:01.28 The instance.
00:32:01.28 --> 00:32:05.64 And since all went down there with the lynch, Alex, for I shoot another living
00:32:05.64 --> 00:32:08.08 ace 25 victories.
00:32:08.08 --> 00:32:10.76 These guys are bigger in life, you know.
00:32:10.76 --> 00:32:16.28 And your teams have the same reputations.
00:32:16.28 --> 00:32:20.60 Yeah, when I checked into seal team one, the executive officer was a prime listed guy
00:32:20.60 --> 00:32:24.04 that was a Vietnam legend.
00:32:24.04 --> 00:32:27.72 There's a famous picture of the seals and Vietnam of this.
00:32:27.72 --> 00:32:30.72 The picture always says that dirty doesn't on it, even though there's more than 12 of them.
00:32:30.72 --> 00:32:37.12 But it says that dirty does and they're holding up a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,
00:32:37.12 --> 00:32:38.36 he's one of the guys in that picture.
00:32:38.36 --> 00:32:43.40 You know, he's the guy that he's one of the guys that the seal teams reputation is built
00:32:43.40 --> 00:32:44.40 upon.
00:32:44.40 --> 00:32:49.52 And I, I remember looking, you know, look, I, at that time, I didn't know the difference
00:32:49.52 --> 00:32:55.52 between a marksmanship ribbon and a metal of honor when you're looking at the uniform.
00:32:55.52 --> 00:32:57.52 And I'm, I just looked in, said that's a lot.
00:32:57.52 --> 00:33:00.44 These guys got a lot of decorations on his uniform.
00:33:00.44 --> 00:33:04.04 And we, you know, the ones that I did know the purple heart, this overstar, I'm looking
00:33:04.04 --> 00:33:10.88 at it going, okay, this, this, this is, this is a, this is everything you dream of, right?
00:33:10.88 --> 00:33:12.52 It's to be sitting across my table.
00:33:12.52 --> 00:33:14.16 I'm 19 years old.
00:33:14.16 --> 00:33:16.88 And this guy's telling me, welcome aboard seal team one.
00:33:16.88 --> 00:33:19.48 Oh, that's right.
00:33:19.48 --> 00:33:20.68 It doesn't get me better than that.
00:33:20.68 --> 00:33:26.32 And the little thing example of where they've been and what they've done.
00:33:26.32 --> 00:33:32.32 And they're willingness, like, philenchin at holes, five or six of the guys who had really
00:33:32.32 --> 00:33:34.32 done it all.
00:33:34.32 --> 00:33:36.68 They, they made no bones upon it.
00:33:36.68 --> 00:33:38.84 They were there to mentor us.
00:33:38.84 --> 00:33:44.52 They went home and night with their families and their grown kids and their glasses
00:33:44.52 --> 00:33:48.56 got and they let the fund us.
00:33:48.56 --> 00:33:54.24 I flew two to three times a day, just as much as I could stand.
00:33:54.24 --> 00:33:59.76 And that's what, when I showed you a log book today, yeah, that's pretty good for
00:33:59.76 --> 00:34:03.16 the final pilot at my age.
00:34:03.16 --> 00:34:10.32 And I ended up at first quarter, fifteen hundred hours a head of my contemporaries.
00:34:10.32 --> 00:34:13.56 Dave, how many hours did you fly at your first quadrant?
00:34:13.56 --> 00:34:18.20 I left my first quadrant after four years with twelve hundred hours.
00:34:18.20 --> 00:34:21.36 So the numbers you're talking about when I said I don't ever remember flying too much
00:34:21.36 --> 00:34:23.60 is because I didn't get to fly like that.
00:34:23.60 --> 00:34:24.60 That's impressive.
00:34:24.60 --> 00:34:27.84 So you did fourteen hundred hours after four years.
00:34:27.84 --> 00:34:33.20 Dan, you're saying you had fifteen hundred hours more than your contemporaries.
00:34:33.20 --> 00:34:34.20 Yeah.
00:34:34.20 --> 00:34:35.20 Yeah.
00:34:35.20 --> 00:34:38.84 Well, you know, I thoroughly liked it.
00:34:38.84 --> 00:34:43.08 Well, I was there. I got to fly the F6FL cat.
00:34:43.08 --> 00:34:48.68 Gino, they had a bunch of my repair facility in North Island.
00:34:48.68 --> 00:34:55.64 And Gino kept talking about the guns and how he worked everything in that airplane.
00:34:55.64 --> 00:34:57.96 That's where he got his victories.
00:34:57.96 --> 00:35:00.32 So he says, you want to fly it?
00:35:00.32 --> 00:35:05.84 So I picked a phone up and he called the chief over the Naval repair facility.
00:35:05.84 --> 00:35:09.40 And he says, I got six of my, I can't get anybody to fly him.
00:35:09.40 --> 00:35:12.64 So I'm going to over and I flew the F6FL cat.
00:35:12.64 --> 00:35:19.36 When you're transferring from one helicopter up from one aircraft to another aircraft,
00:35:19.36 --> 00:35:23.12 how hard is it to make those adaptations?
00:35:23.12 --> 00:35:25.48 It's easy.
00:35:25.48 --> 00:35:29.84 If you love it, Jacoits, easy.
00:35:29.84 --> 00:35:31.96 Later on, the book, I'm sure.
00:35:31.96 --> 00:35:32.96 We were up at Dreamland.
00:35:32.96 --> 00:35:33.96 Yeah.
00:35:33.96 --> 00:35:34.96 Area 51.
00:35:34.96 --> 00:35:44.08 And in 30 minutes, I came in and a transport didn't even know where I was.
00:35:44.08 --> 00:35:49.68 They took us in a hanger, an open hanger doors, because they didn't want the satellites
00:35:49.68 --> 00:35:51.72 to see what they had.
00:35:51.72 --> 00:35:56.24 And Guy walks in with me and says, come on, climb up.
00:35:56.24 --> 00:35:59.24 So I climbed a cockpit of a make.
00:35:59.24 --> 00:36:03.08 30 minutes of the air, I was in the air and that same airplane.
00:36:03.08 --> 00:36:06.60 You know, it's like driving your Porsche.
00:36:06.60 --> 00:36:07.60 Right.
00:36:07.60 --> 00:36:09.04 Once you can handle a Porsche.
00:36:09.04 --> 00:36:14.60 Or my Dodge Caravan in my case, but it's all good.
00:36:14.60 --> 00:36:16.80 Anyhow, long wind day, answer, but no.
00:36:16.80 --> 00:36:17.80 It's easy.
00:36:17.80 --> 00:36:26.36 Once you're either a part of it and you can do it, new airplanes are exciting.
00:36:26.36 --> 00:36:30.32 You go on a little bit more about your checking in and you say this, the officer of the
00:36:30.32 --> 00:36:33.000 day said, why don't you go get your flight gear and put it in
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000 your new locker.
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.88 He pointed out a bank of them in the main hanger.
00:36:37.88 --> 00:36:40.92 When I found my assigned locker, I opened it up to find it was full of somebody else's
00:36:40.92 --> 00:36:41.92 stuff.
00:36:41.92 --> 00:36:43.72 I think there's been a mistake I said.
00:36:43.72 --> 00:36:45.40 The officer of the day looked stricken.
00:36:45.40 --> 00:36:46.40 Sorry about that.
00:36:46.40 --> 00:36:48.28 We forgot to clear it out.
00:36:48.28 --> 00:36:49.44 Clear it out.
00:36:49.44 --> 00:36:52.68 That locker belonged to Lieutenant J.G. replacing.
00:36:52.68 --> 00:36:55.56 He was killed a little while back, accident.
00:36:55.56 --> 00:36:57.24 Go ahead and throw everything away.
00:36:57.24 --> 00:36:59.80 The rest of his effects already went to his family.
00:36:59.80 --> 00:37:04.12 I walked back to the locker and stared at the items inside with a new perspective.
00:37:04.12 --> 00:37:09.72 A radiolt-teacher to hung on one hook, a few other nickmacks and toiletries sat on the shelf.
00:37:09.72 --> 00:37:11.40 Then I noticed something unusual.
00:37:11.40 --> 00:37:13.76 A pair of eyes were staring back at me.
00:37:13.76 --> 00:37:18.32 I reached in and pulled off the top shelf at tiny stuffed mouse.
00:37:18.32 --> 00:37:23.000 It was about two inches tall with big eyes, soft gray fur and a tail.
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.32 The toy seemed out of place in a fighter pilot's locker.
00:37:27.32 --> 00:37:31.68 Was it a gift to his child never delivered because of that last fatal flight?
00:37:31.68 --> 00:37:34.68 Was it a gift from his child to him?
00:37:34.68 --> 00:37:40.04 If it was a lucky talisman that served as a reminder of who waited for him back home,
00:37:40.04 --> 00:37:43.56 I hated to think it had failed him.
00:37:43.56 --> 00:37:45.32 Suddenly I didn't want to know.
00:37:45.32 --> 00:37:47.16 Talk about an attitude adjustment.
00:37:47.16 --> 00:37:53.32 My problem seemed trivial, selfish compared to the death of the mouse's owner.
00:37:53.32 --> 00:37:55.68 I trashed the shirt and toy the trees.
00:37:55.68 --> 00:38:00.48 As the mouse hovered over the can, I held it there and regarded it again.
00:38:00.48 --> 00:38:03.28 Who might have throw away another man's mouse?
00:38:03.28 --> 00:38:08.44 I took the little guy back to my flight bag and made him a nest deep inside.
00:38:08.44 --> 00:38:13.04 That mouse is part of the whole story.
00:38:13.04 --> 00:38:21.000 He lives right now on about the fourth bookshelf in our library at home.
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.80 He's there.
00:38:26.80 --> 00:38:30.08 You continue on and this is what you were starting to talk about a little earlier.
00:38:30.08 --> 00:38:34.52 But in my squadron, the senior leadership came of age in World War 2 in Korean and the Korean
00:38:34.52 --> 00:38:35.52 War.
00:38:35.52 --> 00:38:39.96 They told us how during the Pacific War, they learned to avoid getting into a turning
00:38:39.96 --> 00:38:43.40 dogfight with more maneuverable Japanese fighters.
00:38:43.40 --> 00:38:48.36 Trying to turn with more agile Japanese planes would get your tail shot off.
00:38:48.36 --> 00:38:50.60 They took their shot and flew away.
00:38:50.60 --> 00:38:53.44 One pass, Hall-Ass was the Axium.
00:38:53.44 --> 00:38:57.04 They learned to work together in pairs, cooperating to make sure that an enemy couldn't
00:38:57.04 --> 00:38:58.92 latch onto a pilot's tail.
00:38:58.92 --> 00:39:03.16 The other American pilot was always ready to turn towards his partner and stick his guns
00:39:03.16 --> 00:39:05.12 in the enemy's face.
00:39:05.12 --> 00:39:10.56 My flight leader Bill Armstrong explained to me that in Korea, the opposite was the case.
00:39:10.56 --> 00:39:16.72 The tactics of World War 2 would get a pilot killed going up against a communist Meg 15.
00:39:16.72 --> 00:39:23.72 Those jets were faster and through higher than anything the Navy had, including the hot F-9F
00:39:23.72 --> 00:39:26.32 Panther-I had flown in training.
00:39:26.32 --> 00:39:31.44 Given the Meg speed and advantage, given the Meg speed advantage, the horizontal plane became
00:39:31.44 --> 00:39:33.32 the Panthers playground.
00:39:33.32 --> 00:39:39.84 It could outturn the Meg 15, so in just six years we changed tactics altogether.
00:39:39.84 --> 00:39:45.36 One pass Hall-Ass went away and US fighter pilots found their advantage in sharp turning
00:39:45.36 --> 00:39:47.000 dog fights.
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.32 In the missile age, it was all changing again.
00:39:50.32 --> 00:39:52.92 At least that's what the Navy believed.
00:39:52.92 --> 00:39:57.20 We would simply be directed by ground control to a point in the sky, lock our little circle
00:39:57.20 --> 00:39:59.36 on the dot and let loose with a missile.
00:39:59.36 --> 00:40:05.88 No more, see to the pan's flying and maneuvering in sharply turning fights.
00:40:05.88 --> 00:40:09.24 Technology promised a revolution.
00:40:09.24 --> 00:40:14.24 During my time at FVA W3, the old ways were outlawed.
00:40:14.24 --> 00:40:20.80 Dog fighting officially known as Air Combat maneuvering or ACM was forbidden.
00:40:20.80 --> 00:40:24.76 In 1960, the year before I left for my next assignment, the Navy shuttered the last of the
00:40:24.76 --> 00:40:30.08 old schools that trained fighter pilots to dog fight, the Fleet Air Gunner Unit at
00:40:30.08 --> 00:40:31.48 El Central.
00:40:31.48 --> 00:40:35.36 From then on, Air Combat maneuvering was banned.
00:40:35.36 --> 00:40:40.88 If you were caught hassling, as we called dog fighting, your career could end.
00:40:40.88 --> 00:40:44.92 The edict against dog fighting divided our squadron into three factions.
00:40:44.92 --> 00:40:48.92 Our senior leadership whose experience ran countered at everything the Navy was doing now
00:40:48.92 --> 00:40:53.40 had fought two wars and had seen friends die.
00:40:53.40 --> 00:40:56.44 Having spent years away from their families on fleet deployments, they focused on being
00:40:56.44 --> 00:40:58.36 dads and husbands.
00:40:58.36 --> 00:41:02.20 At the end of their careers, they were content to mentor us nuggets on the ground, share
00:41:02.20 --> 00:41:05.88 experiences and teach us how to be leaders.
00:41:05.88 --> 00:41:08.68 They left the bulk of the flying to the younger guys.
00:41:08.68 --> 00:41:13.08 In the second camp, we're junior officers who bought into the new way.
00:41:13.08 --> 00:41:19.24 They never hassled, never pushed their sky rays to the edge of the flight envelope.
00:41:19.24 --> 00:41:24.16 The third group, a quiet group of young tigers, fought otherwise.
00:41:24.16 --> 00:41:29.16 I was one of them, and we decided to do something about it.
00:41:29.16 --> 00:41:34.60 A little division, little groups, little clicks of people.
00:41:34.60 --> 00:41:41.000 The older tired guys look, they're doing their jobs, but they're not too concerned.
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.80 The guys that are listening to the way the Navy is saying it's going to be done and they're
00:41:44.80 --> 00:41:46.60 okay with that.
00:41:46.60 --> 00:41:49.24 And then you guys that wanted to scrap.
00:41:49.24 --> 00:41:54.92 It's a matter of your personal courage.
00:41:54.92 --> 00:41:59.92 That's in one of your books.
00:41:59.92 --> 00:42:01.92 The pen on how good you want to be in the airplane.
00:42:01.92 --> 00:42:07.60 A lot of guys were getting ready to go with the airlines, just booking flight time to go
00:42:07.60 --> 00:42:09.000 with the airlines.
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000 At this time, airline pilots made a ton of money, right?
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.88 Then on fur bun, 10, 20 years.
00:42:17.88 --> 00:42:20.80 But I never, I never even considered that.
00:42:20.80 --> 00:42:31.12 And I couldn't give up going to 50,000 feet in six degree climb angle, right day.
00:42:31.12 --> 00:42:34.000 Dave, you didn't get tempted by Delta or American?
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.56 I'm squarely in his cabin.
00:42:36.56 --> 00:42:38.80 So this is what happens.
00:42:38.80 --> 00:42:42.96 This next chapter is called Fight Club.
00:42:42.96 --> 00:42:46.92 You say here off the California coast about 80 miles west of San Diego, there's a sector
00:42:46.92 --> 00:42:50.56 of restricted airspace that encompasses saying Clemente Island.
00:42:50.56 --> 00:42:52.60 It's a military reservation.
00:42:52.60 --> 00:42:57.96 Air controllers call it Whiskey 291, the US Navy squadrons in Southern California, use it
00:42:57.96 --> 00:43:00.40 for training exercises.
00:43:00.40 --> 00:43:02.20 That was our playground.
00:43:02.20 --> 00:43:07.56 I first heard about West's, the West Coast elicit dog fighting scene one night after
00:43:07.56 --> 00:43:09.40 hours in San Diego bar.
00:43:09.40 --> 00:43:12.72 It might have been the hotel del Coronado or a Mexican restaurant where we knocked back
00:43:12.72 --> 00:43:14.000 to Kila.
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.20 It was certainly not at the North Island officers club or in the ready room.
00:43:18.20 --> 00:43:21.56 There were too many ears that could make things difficult.
00:43:21.56 --> 00:43:23.68 We were free to fly almost anywhere we wanted.
00:43:23.68 --> 00:43:28.60 Our squadron had plenty of aircraft and our chain of command encouraged us to get stick time.
00:43:28.60 --> 00:43:32.12 Almost always we could find a valid reason to fly.
00:43:32.12 --> 00:43:35.24 Here's the thing, you learn by doing.
00:43:35.24 --> 00:43:40.72 Those of us who live to fly learned our craft by flying a lot.
00:43:40.72 --> 00:43:44.56 One Friday afternoon after a long week on standing alert, I went to the maintenance shop
00:43:44.56 --> 00:43:46.52 and signed out a Ford.
00:43:46.52 --> 00:43:51.68 I had heard that at the bar on Friday afternoons before cocktail hour was the best time
00:43:51.68 --> 00:43:54.44 to find our version of a street race.
00:43:54.44 --> 00:43:58.32 I took off from North Island and headed west for Whiskey 291.
00:43:58.32 --> 00:44:02.80 The unwritten rules in my mind, one of them established a hard deck at 5000 feet.
00:44:02.80 --> 00:44:06.36 This meant that the fight was over the moment you dip below that altitude.
00:44:06.36 --> 00:44:07.88 It was a nod to safety.
00:44:07.88 --> 00:44:12.60 If you ran into trouble and entered a spin, you needed that altitude to recover.
00:44:12.60 --> 00:44:18.08 By joining this fight club, we were keeping the flame alive for a certain way of being
00:44:18.08 --> 00:44:19.80 a fighter pilot.
00:44:19.80 --> 00:44:21.16 It was also serious.
00:44:21.16 --> 00:44:24.44 We were preserving our birthright as naval aviators.
00:44:24.44 --> 00:44:28.88 But first time I went out there south of Sanctuary, I was amazed at what I found.
00:44:28.88 --> 00:44:35.60 Marine A4 Skyhawks Air National Guard F86L interceptors Air Force F100 Super Sabers
00:44:35.60 --> 00:44:38.72 and lots of Navy guys flying F8 crew savers.
00:44:38.72 --> 00:44:41.24 There were even a few other forwards from North Island.
00:44:41.24 --> 00:44:46.28 The word had spread far beyond the Navy community and the services mixed it up with fierce
00:44:46.28 --> 00:44:51.20 relish because they all were going through the same institutional evolution away from
00:44:51.20 --> 00:44:57.84 air combat that we and naval aviation were experiencing.
00:44:57.84 --> 00:44:59.36 You this is classic.
00:44:59.36 --> 00:45:01.88 I learned the ropes that first time out.
00:45:01.88 --> 00:45:06.24 Pick your opponent, roll up alongside and give the signal.
00:45:06.24 --> 00:45:08.36 The signal being the bird.
00:45:08.36 --> 00:45:09.76 So you flip the guy off.
00:45:09.76 --> 00:45:11.16 That's how you kick this thing off.
00:45:11.16 --> 00:45:12.96 Let's say you're initiated.
00:45:12.96 --> 00:45:17.84 A smile in the wave and a 45 degree bank in opposite break in opposite directions.
00:45:17.84 --> 00:45:20.68 A break means we rolled the wings and turned one way.
00:45:20.68 --> 00:45:23.20 The guy to the left broke left 45 degrees left.
00:45:23.20 --> 00:45:25.16 The guy on the right broke 45 degrees right.
00:45:25.16 --> 00:45:26.76 We'd extend our way.
00:45:26.76 --> 00:45:31.32 We'd extend out away from each other for several seconds until we were a few miles distance.
00:45:31.32 --> 00:45:33.08 Then we began the fight.
00:45:33.08 --> 00:45:37.58 We turned into each other pushing fronals forward in what to the uninitiated look like an
00:45:37.58 --> 00:45:40.60 aerial game of chicken in Mach 1 fighters.
00:45:40.60 --> 00:45:42.000 We're pushing head to head or close to it.
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.68 Two fighters inevitably passed each other close aboard.
00:45:46.68 --> 00:45:48.72 We called this the merge.
00:45:48.72 --> 00:45:52.92 Closing somewhere north of a combined thousand miles an hour meant the merge is over in
00:45:52.92 --> 00:45:54.40 mere three seconds.
00:45:54.40 --> 00:45:58.36 Before a collision we'd break away showing our first best move.
00:45:58.36 --> 00:46:00.08 That was when the hassle began.
00:46:00.08 --> 00:46:02.72 There was no script for what happened after the merge.
00:46:02.72 --> 00:46:05.80 We reacted to each other flying our aircraft as best we could.
00:46:05.80 --> 00:46:07.72 We learned that power is king.
00:46:07.72 --> 00:46:11.76 More gives you the ability to climb above a fight to re-enter it with even more energy and
00:46:11.76 --> 00:46:13.16 a diving attack.
00:46:13.16 --> 00:46:18.000 Power means you can push your bird in a tighter and tighter turn and maintain the air
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.12 speed longer.
00:46:20.12 --> 00:46:24.04 When we had enough and were ready to admit defeat, maybe our opponent gained position
00:46:24.04 --> 00:46:26.000 at six o'clock and never let go.
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.24 We waggle our wings, pulled up the long side our opponent and flew wing to wing.
00:46:31.24 --> 00:46:34.84 Sometimes we smiled unseen behind our oxygen masks and waved.
00:46:34.84 --> 00:46:36.52 Nice flight brother.
00:46:36.52 --> 00:46:40.20 Sometimes we just eyeball each other pissed off that somebody had gotten the better of
00:46:40.20 --> 00:46:41.20 us.
00:46:41.20 --> 00:46:45.32 Invariably out there there was someone a little better than I was but each time I went
00:46:45.32 --> 00:46:52.32 out, when or lose I improved.
00:46:52.32 --> 00:46:54.80 How fun was that?
00:46:54.80 --> 00:46:57.48 And I pay you to go to you know.
00:46:57.48 --> 00:47:00.80 And it sounds like at this time you had unlimited fuel unlimited.
00:47:00.80 --> 00:47:04.60 You do this as much as you possibly want.
00:47:04.60 --> 00:47:10.68 And maybe I bought some Douglas Skyrares Batwing airplane took the guns out which was
00:47:10.68 --> 00:47:19.20 a shame but getting ready for missile stuff.
00:47:19.20 --> 00:47:23.52 It wasn't a great carer plane because it allowed rules stability.
00:47:23.52 --> 00:47:24.92 It was pretty dangerous.
00:47:24.92 --> 00:47:27.72 Kill a lot of guys on the aircraft carer.
00:47:27.72 --> 00:47:32.68 They're in the initial phase of trials with the airplane.
00:47:32.68 --> 00:47:38.08 So they sent them all to be at the F.A.N.P. 3 and it would climb like nothing you ever
00:47:38.08 --> 00:47:39.08 seen.
00:47:39.08 --> 00:47:41.72 Just cram it and burn her and hang on.
00:47:41.72 --> 00:47:49.76 A stick with about six inches high just block her arm and break her gone 30 degrees.
00:47:49.76 --> 00:47:54.16 Go to 60 degrees and go to 50,000 feet.
00:47:54.16 --> 00:47:58.48 You know that's a neat ticket ride and anybody's book.
00:47:58.48 --> 00:48:02.36 Dave did you have any experience where you...
00:48:02.36 --> 00:48:06.28 And we're the Marine Corps didn't know what you were doing but you were out with a bunch
00:48:06.28 --> 00:48:10.12 of your friends and the Navy and the Air Force scrapping.
00:48:10.12 --> 00:48:15.72 And I don't know what the statue of limitations is on this and if you can still get trouble
00:48:15.72 --> 00:48:16.72 at this time.
00:48:16.72 --> 00:48:18.48 No I'm safe now.
00:48:18.48 --> 00:48:20.48 It's not like what you ain't just talking about.
00:48:20.48 --> 00:48:22.44 There isn't an illicit thing.
00:48:22.44 --> 00:48:29.04 What there would be is four guys in the squadron going on the road together.
00:48:29.04 --> 00:48:30.56 Everybody knew we were going.
00:48:30.56 --> 00:48:34.36 And we would do things very similar when we talked about is we would...
00:48:34.36 --> 00:48:37.000 We would do things that badly we weren't supposed to be doing.
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.28 And we were doing another guy is now there was a degree of safety in the organizations
00:48:40.28 --> 00:48:44.000 that communities had come a long way because of what they learned.
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.92 But man we would...
00:48:45.92 --> 00:48:49.60 I have done a lot of things in an airplane that if I had a came back and told my boss
00:48:49.60 --> 00:48:50.60 I did it.
00:48:50.60 --> 00:48:52.60 We would have a real problem.
00:48:52.60 --> 00:48:55.80 And more than anything it's the culture that that generation created.
00:48:55.80 --> 00:49:00.52 We were smart about safety we do a lot of things that to keep the airplanes in us safe.
00:49:00.52 --> 00:49:02.40 But man that spirit and that culture I'm just...
00:49:02.40 --> 00:49:06.24 I mean I'm grinning ear to ear listening to this because that's where this all came from
00:49:06.24 --> 00:49:08.20 was pushing against the organization.
00:49:08.20 --> 00:49:10.24 These are things we have to do and look...
00:49:10.24 --> 00:49:13.56 There's a lot of things I wouldn't tell anybody about.
00:49:13.56 --> 00:49:17.24 You know, while I was doing it looking back on and now it's actually kind of fun to think
00:49:17.24 --> 00:49:18.24 about it.
00:49:18.24 --> 00:49:21.12 Man we did some going on the road for ship out of Miramar.
00:49:21.12 --> 00:49:23.64 Man you had a license to steal.
00:49:23.64 --> 00:49:24.64 It was awesome.
00:49:24.64 --> 00:49:29.20 You know you mentioned this earlier which I read.
00:49:29.20 --> 00:49:37.04 We talked about the naval aviation being the rebel branch of the Navy.
00:49:37.04 --> 00:49:40.96 And you know that attitude right there.
00:49:40.96 --> 00:49:45.52 If you don't have that rebel attitude this these thoughts don't even enter your mind
00:49:45.52 --> 00:49:47.20 to push the envelope like this.
00:49:47.20 --> 00:49:50.76 You know you're dealing in human life.
00:49:50.76 --> 00:49:58.68 You all understand that fully I know when you're every day it's not just fun flying.
00:49:58.68 --> 00:50:01.40 It's serious business.
00:50:01.40 --> 00:50:05.40 It's perfect professional excellence.
00:50:05.40 --> 00:50:06.84 And you keep building it.
00:50:06.84 --> 00:50:14.88 You gotta remember we're talking about the fight club being illegal in the 58-59 and
00:50:14.88 --> 00:50:18.56 60-61.
00:50:18.56 --> 00:50:25.24 And then for the next four years it was still semi-alegal.
00:50:25.24 --> 00:50:30.000 And then along came a four which we'll get to and then sure.
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:38.76 And it became it was it was the menu of the day.
00:50:38.76 --> 00:50:42.32 Haslan was kind of wish everybody could ask.
00:50:42.32 --> 00:50:43.76 Again your butt kicked out.
00:50:43.76 --> 00:50:45.48 Turned Vietnam.
00:50:45.48 --> 00:50:54.16 And all the stuff we learned back in the 58-59-60 it was easy to sell it.
00:50:54.16 --> 00:51:00.20 Yeah you talk about here you say I learned the basics of air combat in those hassles
00:51:00.20 --> 00:51:02.20 never lose sight of your opponent.
00:51:02.20 --> 00:51:03.80 Lucite lose the fight.
00:51:03.80 --> 00:51:05.68 Never go vertical unless you can own it.
00:51:05.68 --> 00:51:09.12 Meaning you have to have enough pure engine power to blast guy or to leave your opponent
00:51:09.12 --> 00:51:13.52 unable to follow you and hammer you from behind.
00:51:13.52 --> 00:51:15.72 Turning fights are like back alley brawls.
00:51:15.72 --> 00:51:19.80 When similar aircraft engage like that the difference is pilot skill and aggressiveness.
00:51:19.80 --> 00:51:25.36 The winner usually is the one with the most guts to push his aircraft to its aerodynamic
00:51:25.36 --> 00:51:26.60 limit.
00:51:26.60 --> 00:51:32.12 In this way we preserved our perishable skills, our perishable skill sets and kept alive
00:51:32.12 --> 00:51:34.20 the fading art of the dogfight.
00:51:34.20 --> 00:51:37.56 The rest of the navy was letting it slip away in the early 1960s.
00:51:37.56 --> 00:51:39.08 I flew whenever I could.
00:51:39.08 --> 00:51:43.000 Holidays were a great time to hassle because the married guys were at home with their
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:47.44 families and the pace of the activity on base relaxed.
00:51:47.44 --> 00:51:51.92 I was still trying to get over Mary Beth so I'd climb in a forward and go look for a good
00:51:51.92 --> 00:51:54.72 fight.
00:51:54.72 --> 00:51:55.72 This is also important.
00:51:55.72 --> 00:51:57.80 Fighting against different types of planes was useful.
00:51:57.80 --> 00:52:02.12 It taught me more than fighting against the same type of plane I was piloting.
00:52:02.12 --> 00:52:07.36 In years and later years at top gone we would call it dissimilar air combat training.
00:52:07.36 --> 00:52:10.56 But back in the late 1950s we didn't have a name for it.
00:52:10.56 --> 00:52:14.68 We just we just intuitively based on experience.
00:52:14.68 --> 00:52:19.40 Each fight with a different type of aircraft, each with its own advantages and weaknesses,
00:52:19.40 --> 00:52:23.64 taught us how to exploit our edge and minimize theirs.
00:52:23.64 --> 00:52:24.92 How did we learn?
00:52:24.92 --> 00:52:25.92 By losing.
00:52:25.92 --> 00:52:27.28 Failure is a teacher.
00:52:27.28 --> 00:52:31.84 Be honest with yourself, extract the lessons and you'll never make that error again.
00:52:31.84 --> 00:52:36.68 I spent many long flights back to North Island, repaying what I did wrong so that on my
00:52:36.68 --> 00:52:42.80 next bout in the inner service flight club I'd bring the heat and wind and wind.
00:52:42.80 --> 00:52:48.40 When we found a top gun this part of the experience in whiskey 2-9-1 became a very important
00:52:48.40 --> 00:52:50.72 component of our culture.
00:52:50.72 --> 00:52:53.72 That's what my point was.
00:52:53.72 --> 00:52:56.56 All of a sudden it wasn't illegal.
00:52:56.56 --> 00:52:58.96 It's we need something like this.
00:52:58.96 --> 00:53:01.44 Can you teach us how?
00:53:01.44 --> 00:53:05.72 And it worked.
00:53:05.72 --> 00:53:10.000 You end up going on deployment.
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.000 I'm skipping ahead a little bit.
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:16.24 The very first cruise game of front row seats to the US Navy Power Projection in action.
00:53:16.24 --> 00:53:20.08 Deployed to West Park, we guarded the sea lanes, trained off the coast of Japan and flew
00:53:20.08 --> 00:53:22.60 the flag at various ports of call.
00:53:22.60 --> 00:53:28.04 Our F3HDmen's intercepted Soviet bombers that periodically dropped down to snoop on us.
00:53:28.04 --> 00:53:31.60 We chased them as soon as our radar was caught them.
00:53:31.60 --> 00:53:36.84 When the TU-95 bears took their photos of us, we wanted a demon in the frame.
00:53:36.84 --> 00:53:41.40 We got our ability to destroy them at will, was a game we played with the Russians for the
00:53:41.40 --> 00:53:43.44 entire Cold War.
00:53:43.44 --> 00:53:47.52 More than once I watched a Russian gunner wave at me as I snapped pictures through the
00:53:47.52 --> 00:53:48.52 canopy.
00:53:48.52 --> 00:53:52.76 Such moments were rare in fleeting just too aircrew at the tip of the spear making
00:53:52.76 --> 00:53:59.48 momentary personal contact at altitude over the world's largest ocean.
00:53:59.48 --> 00:54:06.32 And they usually showed playboy magazine which was newer than we had on the curve.
00:54:06.32 --> 00:54:13.20 It was a game, you know, the news media now makes it sound so serious.
00:54:13.20 --> 00:54:15.20 It was a game.
00:54:15.20 --> 00:54:18.48 They just competitive, what could you do?
00:54:18.48 --> 00:54:27.32 One time I was out, pull up alongside a bear flying a later on flying a fan in my call
00:54:27.32 --> 00:54:31.32 time for my back seat or was a little hot.
00:54:31.32 --> 00:54:37.32 And he, I look in the mirror and we're sitting right next to this bear.
00:54:37.32 --> 00:54:44.04 And in the back seat it's a plastic pink rabbit.
00:54:44.04 --> 00:54:46.24 He's inflated rabbit.
00:54:46.24 --> 00:54:52.000 And the only thing to make or the only thing to bear guys can see in their alls in the
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:58.32 back turret back there trying to look over and laughing because he's put a pink rabbit
00:54:58.32 --> 00:54:59.32 up.
00:54:59.32 --> 00:55:02.32 He's got a stick.
00:55:02.32 --> 00:55:03.32 A little humor.
00:55:03.32 --> 00:55:06.32 But it was, it was no work.
00:55:06.32 --> 00:55:08.72 Yeah, that's awesome.
00:55:08.72 --> 00:55:11.04 You never done anything like that in Marine Corps, did you?
00:55:11.04 --> 00:55:14.88 I was, I was lucky enough to intercept a bear on my first cruise.
00:55:14.88 --> 00:55:18.64 I have just a legendary shot of me in a hornet up against a bear.
00:55:18.64 --> 00:55:20.28 I got to intercept an Iranian.
00:55:20.28 --> 00:55:23.84 I think it was kind of their version of the C130 right on the line there in the Gulf
00:55:23.84 --> 00:55:24.84 pull up alongside.
00:55:24.84 --> 00:55:29.28 And re-living or living for the first time these stories I had heard about for literally
00:55:29.28 --> 00:55:37.56 decades, looking at the window of my fighter at a Iranian cargo plane flying, he's on his
00:55:37.56 --> 00:55:38.56 side of the line.
00:55:38.56 --> 00:55:44.08 On my side there's probably a hundred feet, 200 feet between us, waving maybe some other
00:55:44.08 --> 00:55:45.40 hand signals along the way.
00:55:45.40 --> 00:55:49.000 But those are things that those are pictures of him in your mind.
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.56 You'll never forget those things.
00:55:50.56 --> 00:55:53.92 The first time I intercepted a bear on an alert seven launch off a carrier just sitting
00:55:53.92 --> 00:55:55.56 in the cockpit, launch off.
00:55:55.56 --> 00:55:57.76 I go 20, you know, 12 minutes later.
00:55:57.76 --> 00:56:03.44 I'm in parade off of a bear just thinking how many times has happened for me for anybody
00:56:03.44 --> 00:56:04.44 else before.
00:56:04.44 --> 00:56:09.96 It was a bear and say, love to come down and go fast and ride along the way.
00:56:09.96 --> 00:56:10.96 That could occur.
00:56:10.96 --> 00:56:14.20 They'll make a low pass on the carrier.
00:56:14.20 --> 00:56:16.40 So you got to be, you got to be in the picture.
00:56:16.40 --> 00:56:20.08 I got to let them know that you have been there the whole time.
00:56:20.08 --> 00:56:22.08 The only because of you are they getting to do that.
00:56:22.08 --> 00:56:27.24 So it's a cool history to say I got to do that.
00:56:27.24 --> 00:56:34.28 Speaking of always, oh, all business, we say here we broke out above the cloud layer at
00:56:34.28 --> 00:56:36.20 15,000 feet and I'm fast-forwarding.
00:56:36.20 --> 00:56:37.56 No moon, no visible horizon.
00:56:37.56 --> 00:56:40.96 My demon suffered electrical failure and the lights went out in the cockpit.
00:56:40.96 --> 00:56:45.16 A wind powered auxiliary unit was supposed to deploy in such a situation but that failed
00:56:45.16 --> 00:56:46.16 as well.
00:56:46.16 --> 00:56:51.44 There I was surrounded by absolute darkness using a 90 degree angled flashlight to periodically
00:56:51.44 --> 00:56:52.76 check my instruments.
00:56:52.76 --> 00:56:56.12 I was flying that mission with our squadron executive officer Lieutenant Commander Joe
00:56:56.12 --> 00:57:00.16 Paulk who realized my predicament and came to my rescue.
00:57:00.16 --> 00:57:05.000 Joe sent a signal to me with his flashlight, followed me and pointed to the handcocks
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000 latest position.
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:11.40 It was an eerie sensation flying on his wing in the dark on route to the handcocks
00:57:11.40 --> 00:57:12.68 waiting deck.
00:57:12.68 --> 00:57:19.08 I forced myself to keep my wings level relative to his wing and belly navigation lights.
00:57:19.08 --> 00:57:25.36 I used small precise control inputs made easier by Joe's smooth flying.
00:57:25.36 --> 00:57:29.68 We broke out of the cloud layer about a mile and a half a stern of the ship.
00:57:29.68 --> 00:57:32.04 We could see the white strobes back in us.
00:57:32.04 --> 00:57:36.52 I continued flying Joe's wing until his lights went out and he turned away to give
00:57:36.52 --> 00:57:38.72 me a clear shot at the deck.
00:57:38.72 --> 00:57:42.44 The electrical failure had knocked out my radio which meant I could not talk to the landing
00:57:42.44 --> 00:57:43.72 signal officer.
00:57:43.72 --> 00:57:45.28 All I could do was watch his lights.
00:57:45.28 --> 00:57:49.32 A green one meant keep coming flashing reds would be the dreaded wave off, go around
00:57:49.32 --> 00:57:50.72 and try again.
00:57:50.72 --> 00:57:52.76 I didn't have enough fuel for that.
00:57:52.76 --> 00:57:57.48 So if I missed, I'd have to eject, trusting that someone would find me in the stormy
00:57:57.48 --> 00:57:58.48 sea.
00:57:58.48 --> 00:58:02.12 I made it down and felt the tail hook catch one of the deck wires.
00:58:02.12 --> 00:58:04.32 The demon lurched to a hole.
00:58:04.32 --> 00:58:06.48 A close call for sure but it was nover.
00:58:06.48 --> 00:58:11.000 The next night while flying the same demon, the same thing happened again.
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.68 I was on Joe's wing and he brought me back to the handcocks for an encore performance.
00:58:15.68 --> 00:58:18.92 I landed safely after another gut check approach.
00:58:18.92 --> 00:58:23.96 Perhaps we joked about him saving me twice.
00:58:23.96 --> 00:58:26.28 The interracing point on an end, Joe.
00:58:26.28 --> 00:58:28.64 You mean beyond the fastest landing at the weekend?
00:58:28.64 --> 00:58:32.24 Yeah, you're reading a lot of the book.
00:58:32.24 --> 00:58:39.68 And the next paragraph says, can't figure out two nights in a row and happened to me.
00:58:39.68 --> 00:58:46.52 And they are playing flu during the daylight hours successfully with no electrical failure
00:58:46.52 --> 00:58:48.88 in between that do event.
00:58:48.88 --> 00:58:52.08 I started to get spooked a little bit.
00:58:52.08 --> 00:58:54.80 What somebody said me a message.
00:58:54.80 --> 00:59:01.60 Yeah, and the reason I brought that or the reason I wanted to read that is, look, it's
00:59:01.60 --> 00:59:03.60 peace time, it doesn't matter.
00:59:03.60 --> 00:59:08.20 When you're flying and landing on an aircraft carrier and the weather and mechanical failures,
00:59:08.20 --> 00:59:12.48 I used to say this about I would tell the young seals when you go out and do water
00:59:12.48 --> 00:59:15.88 operations, everything you do is a real world mission.
00:59:15.88 --> 00:59:20.32 Is that the ocean can kill you if you make a mistake, you die.
00:59:20.32 --> 00:59:24.72 And I used to say that pre-war, you know, in the 90s when I would try to be get guys to
00:59:24.72 --> 00:59:29.48 make sure they're taking stuff seriously and not gaffing off procedures.
00:59:29.48 --> 00:59:30.48 And it's the same thing here.
00:59:30.48 --> 00:59:34.16 I mean, I can't just this idea.
00:59:34.16 --> 00:59:38.36 And I'm pretty sure I know the angled flashlight that you're talking about is probably
00:59:38.36 --> 00:59:40.76 the same, yeah, that piece of crap.
00:59:40.76 --> 00:59:41.76 You're lucky.
00:59:41.76 --> 00:59:42.76 That thing didn't fail.
00:59:42.76 --> 00:59:43.76 Green one.
00:59:43.76 --> 00:59:44.76 Yeah.
00:59:44.76 --> 00:59:45.76 Yeah.
00:59:45.76 --> 00:59:51.48 And then the other thought that thing I thought was awesome about this was Joe knowing.
00:59:51.48 --> 00:59:55.76 All right, I'm going to guide him right in and then I'm going to black myself out.
00:59:55.76 --> 00:59:57.60 I'm going to get out of his way and it's on you.
00:59:57.60 --> 00:59:59.96 You just, you guys can't even talk, but you know what to do.
00:59:59.96 --> 01:00:01.32 He knows what to do.
01:00:01.32 --> 01:00:04.28 The guy that's landing, you know what to do.
01:00:04.28 --> 01:00:06.28 That's awesome.
01:00:06.28 --> 01:00:08.28 That's the naval aviation training.
01:00:08.28 --> 01:00:09.28 There it is.
01:00:09.28 --> 01:00:10.28 Right, Nate.
01:00:10.28 --> 01:00:12.28 Hey, man.
01:00:12.28 --> 01:00:17.000 Go on here, you say Mary Beth had gotten married to her football player.
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.88 I never tried to win her back.
01:00:18.88 --> 01:00:21.48 And that was on the, you talk about this is on the advice of your mom.
01:00:21.48 --> 01:00:24.16 He said, don't, no, you let her go.
01:00:24.16 --> 01:00:26.84 Her marriage was the final nail in the coffin of my wishful thinking.
01:00:26.84 --> 01:00:28.44 I had let her go.
01:00:28.44 --> 01:00:30.48 Eventually I met a wonderful girl.
01:00:30.48 --> 01:00:35.88 A wonderful young woman in Coronado, Maddie, and married her 1959 a year later, our daughter
01:00:35.88 --> 01:00:37.16 Dana arrived.
01:00:37.16 --> 01:00:43.84 My wife and I began a 17 year journey in Navy life with far too much of it spent to park.
01:00:43.84 --> 01:00:46.12 Flying as a dangerous game of risk and reward.
01:00:46.12 --> 01:00:47.96 Push too far and you pay the price.
01:00:47.96 --> 01:00:53.32 Before I joined the black lines, I only had to look out for myself and my squadron mates.
01:00:53.32 --> 01:00:54.32 Different game now.
01:00:54.32 --> 01:00:59.12 I live for two others who depend on me becoming a family man, coincided with my first
01:00:59.12 --> 01:01:02.36 fleet assignment on board the handcock.
01:01:02.36 --> 01:01:05.88 My 1962 deployment lasted from February to November.
01:01:05.88 --> 01:01:09.52 We got back to the West Coast and started training for the next one, running simulated
01:01:09.52 --> 01:01:13.48 intercepts in our demons three or four nights a week on that schedule.
01:01:13.48 --> 01:01:16.04 Even when we were home, we were really not home.
01:01:16.04 --> 01:01:21.48 Our 1963 deployment began in the spring and being home after being home for less than six
01:01:21.48 --> 01:01:22.48 months.
01:01:22.48 --> 01:01:27.80 Hugs, good buys, tears on cheeks, Dana's little hand pressed into mine.
01:01:27.80 --> 01:01:32.32 Then back to the ship to manage a long distance relationship through handwritten letters, voice
01:01:32.32 --> 01:01:36.44 messages on cassette tapes and an occasional phone call.
01:01:36.44 --> 01:01:39.12 The second parting for my family was worse than the first.
01:01:39.12 --> 01:01:43.52 I didn't want to be a stranger to my own daughter but what choice did I have?
01:01:43.52 --> 01:01:44.92 The Navy wanted me to go.
01:01:44.92 --> 01:01:47.44 The Navy needed me to go to the other side of the Pacific.
01:01:47.44 --> 01:01:55.92 It was my sworn duty to go.
01:01:55.92 --> 01:01:58.60 After ten years flying fighters, now you're on deployment.
01:01:58.60 --> 01:02:00.64 After ten years of, and I'm fast-forwarding.
01:02:00.64 --> 01:02:03.32 After ten years of flying fighters, I felt ready and confident.
01:02:03.32 --> 01:02:09.40 I'd ace the F4 training at VF-121, the West Coast Replacement Air Group Rag for the
01:02:09.40 --> 01:02:10.64 Phantom community.
01:02:10.64 --> 01:02:14.76 The squadron prepared all new F4 crews for their Vietnam deployments.
01:02:14.76 --> 01:02:20.48 We flew constantly training hard at our beyond visual range missile intercepts.
01:02:20.48 --> 01:02:25.04 We even got to shoot at a drone with a sparrow, one of the only times I'd actually
01:02:25.04 --> 01:02:28.96 fired one of these high tech weapons.
01:02:28.96 --> 01:02:31.80 So you guys get the F4 fan of now.
01:02:31.80 --> 01:02:34.000 I think that's my favorite American aircraft.
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000 I don't know.
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.12 I'm actually sure it is my favorite American aircraft.
01:02:39.12 --> 01:02:43.52 I guess the second maybe the Coursaire, the World War II Coursaire.
01:02:43.52 --> 01:02:45.80 Obviously, but then you got the P-5.
01:02:45.80 --> 01:02:46.80 Okay.
01:02:46.80 --> 01:02:48.60 We'll go down that.
01:02:48.60 --> 01:02:50.76 But you're flying the F4 fan of.
01:02:50.76 --> 01:02:55.96 And that's once again, this is the space craft on bus.
01:02:55.96 --> 01:03:00.08 That's beautiful.
01:03:00.08 --> 01:03:01.88 That's the bird that they have at Pensacola.
01:03:01.88 --> 01:03:02.88 Did you go to Pensacola Dave?
01:03:02.88 --> 01:03:03.88 I did.
01:03:03.88 --> 01:03:04.88 Yeah.
01:03:04.88 --> 01:03:09.000 That's the bird that they have in the like the premier spot at Pensacola, the big
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.48 giant one sitting where you marched by every day.
01:03:13.48 --> 01:03:14.80 So that's what you're flying.
01:03:14.80 --> 01:03:18.04 And now you're on deployment.
01:03:18.04 --> 01:03:21.88 You go to Pearl Harbor for a little while after a few days in Pearl, we were on a way
01:03:21.88 --> 01:03:30.28 west to Sassabo, Japan, our rival was met by massive protests, student and radicals opposed
01:03:30.28 --> 01:03:32.52 to the Vietnam War.
01:03:32.52 --> 01:03:35.96 When the carrier or a scony, how you say that?
01:03:35.96 --> 01:03:37.24 A risk in me.
01:03:37.24 --> 01:03:42.40 When the carrier or a risk in me called it Sassabo, around the same time we did, we learned
01:03:42.40 --> 01:03:49.16 that its air wing had lost half its aircraft over North Vietnam.
01:03:49.16 --> 01:03:54.32 It suffered a third of its air crews either killed, wounded, or missing in action.
01:03:54.32 --> 01:04:00.96 Their casualty list eventually included Lieutenant J.G. John McCain, future senator from Arizona
01:04:00.96 --> 01:04:05.08 who is captured in October 1967.
01:04:05.08 --> 01:04:10.12 Only a few weeks before our ships crossed paths, one of the F8 pilots, Lieutenant Commander
01:04:10.12 --> 01:04:16.68 Dick Sheifert, fought an epic duel against six North Vietnamese megs, 17s and meg 21s.
01:04:16.68 --> 01:04:21.84 It had been escorting an A4 Skyhawk strike when they were attacked, Sheifert fired all
01:04:21.84 --> 01:04:26.92 three of his side-winder missiles, but each malfunctioned or missed.
01:04:26.92 --> 01:04:31.12 When he switched to his 20-millimeter cannon, the hijie maneuvering jammed the pneumatic
01:04:31.12 --> 01:04:33.92 feed system, leaving him defenseless.
01:04:33.92 --> 01:04:39.000 Nevertheless, he stalemated the migs with an exceptional display of flying before slipping
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.72 away on the dregs of his remaining fuel.
01:04:41.72 --> 01:04:46.64 The fighters showed up a moment later and downed one of the migs, they fired seven missiles
01:04:46.64 --> 01:04:53.20 in that fight, only one hit.
01:04:53.20 --> 01:04:58.52 So this is where, and you're going to, the history in this is awesome, talking about the
01:04:58.52 --> 01:05:01.56 weapon systems, talking about the failures you're talking about.
01:05:01.56 --> 01:05:05.72 It's not only the pilots, not getting trained the way they should be, but the weapon systems
01:05:05.72 --> 01:05:08.04 aren't doing what they're supposed to be doing.
01:05:08.04 --> 01:05:13.20 This idea of intercept fighting was, hey, we're going to stay 12 miles away.
01:05:13.20 --> 01:05:19.56 I lock on my missile system, I shoot it, and then I run away, and the missile does the job.
01:05:19.56 --> 01:05:27.16 That was what the plan was from the Pentagon, and from the brass.
01:05:27.16 --> 01:05:35.52 That's, you know, industry designs on the NA Billum, and we fly in what we're given.
01:05:35.52 --> 01:05:44.96 And each subject you've read about here is leading up to why top-cun was formed.
01:05:44.96 --> 01:05:48.08 In other words, the missiles never worked.
01:05:48.08 --> 01:05:51.36 They're big, they're expensive.
01:05:51.36 --> 01:05:55.000 How you handle them on the aircraft carriers, another problem.
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.20 They're all problems.
01:05:57.20 --> 01:06:01.80 You know, somebody paid for them, they were paid for them, they sent them a fleet, and they
01:06:01.80 --> 01:06:02.80 don't work.
01:06:02.80 --> 01:06:09.40 But in peace time, you never use them in anger, so you don't know that.
01:06:09.40 --> 01:06:16.32 The Phantom was designed one way, Mac Billed a beautiful airplane, but it was designed
01:06:16.32 --> 01:06:18.40 as an interceptor.
01:06:18.40 --> 01:06:22.24 We had never had it in combat.
01:06:22.24 --> 01:06:31.44 And all these situations you're talking about lead to top-cun failure make it better right
01:06:31.44 --> 01:06:33.68 now.
01:06:33.68 --> 01:06:39.28 The time frame they gave us was two months, but the graduate school together, we've
01:06:39.28 --> 01:06:43.68 been doing this for five years of war in the name working.
01:06:43.68 --> 01:06:48.28 So you could even be a couple months, put a graduate school.
01:06:48.28 --> 01:06:55.28 Initially, though the original nine guys or eight guys who were with me, we were trying
01:06:55.28 --> 01:07:00.48 to figure out whether we were getting sandbagged, you know, whether somebody was setting
01:07:00.48 --> 01:07:05.24 us up, you believe it on young guys, they couldn't cut it.
01:07:05.24 --> 01:07:09.000 Well, we didn't turn out quite that way.
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:18.36 So anyhow, all I want to make point is a lot of what you're reading is how and why
01:07:18.36 --> 01:07:22.16 and top-cun ended up and the more about there.
01:07:22.16 --> 01:07:27.96 Yeah, I know it's the way you lay the pieces out of how it comes to fruition is history.
01:07:27.96 --> 01:07:30.04 I don't think a lot of people know about it.
01:07:30.04 --> 01:07:38.12 No, they only know about the movie, top-cun original movie.
01:07:38.12 --> 01:07:43.52 There's a little situation, a little scenario that unfolds in Korea.
01:07:43.52 --> 01:07:51.60 There's a little problem and you end up having to go up there and you arrive on stage,
01:07:51.60 --> 01:07:54.76 you're going back to the book, we arrive on stage to face terrible winter weather.
01:07:54.76 --> 01:07:59.08 We sailed through blizzard and snow squalls that left us unable to see the end of the flight
01:07:59.08 --> 01:08:01.92 deck from the ship's island.
01:08:01.92 --> 01:08:03.92 The flight deck turned out to be covered in ice.
01:08:03.92 --> 01:08:08.08 The crew had to assist us to our F4 fanom so we didn't slip and fall.
01:08:08.08 --> 01:08:12.96 Once in the cockpit, we were towed to the catapult so we didn't slide around on the ice.
01:08:12.96 --> 01:08:16.04 A night cat shot is always an experience.
01:08:16.04 --> 01:08:18.92 Add snow flaries and heavy seas and you've got a real adventure.
01:08:18.92 --> 01:08:21.08 We climbed it once you launched it.
01:08:21.08 --> 01:08:25.36 We climbed above 20,000 feet but never broke free in the storm.
01:08:25.36 --> 01:08:28.52 It was so thick that Skank and I couldn't even see each other.
01:08:28.52 --> 01:08:32.80 My back seat or dentist stuffy tracked him on radar and we followed a few miles behind.
01:08:32.80 --> 01:08:35.12 Snow and ice last our fanom's.
01:08:35.12 --> 01:08:37.76 The wind screen was a kaleidoscope of snowflakes.
01:08:37.76 --> 01:08:39.68 It was like flying through a snow globe.
01:08:39.68 --> 01:08:44.04 The enterprise finally vectored us to a holding pattern before we returned to the ship.
01:08:44.04 --> 01:08:47.92 As our approach time grew near, I thought it strange that they never gave us a weather
01:08:47.92 --> 01:08:48.92 report.
01:08:48.92 --> 01:08:52.48 We started our dissense individually through the heart of the blizzard.
01:08:52.48 --> 01:08:54.52 Visibility was almost nil.
01:08:54.52 --> 01:09:00.92 Skank went into land first guided by radar from the ship. He saw nothing on that first approach.
01:09:00.92 --> 01:09:03.32 He saw nothing on that first approach.
01:09:03.32 --> 01:09:07.40 No lights, no carrier, just blizzard and blackness.
01:09:07.40 --> 01:09:13.04 This landing signal officer said, you sounded good when you went by us.
01:09:13.04 --> 01:09:17.60 When he finally landed Skank and the landing signal officer talked to me as I swung around
01:09:17.60 --> 01:09:18.60 the ship again.
01:09:18.60 --> 01:09:22.12 Stay low, follow the ship's wake.
01:09:22.12 --> 01:09:24.88 I got down close to the water as I dared 40 feet.
01:09:24.88 --> 01:09:28.60 Maybe the flight deck is set to at 65 feet off the swells.
01:09:28.60 --> 01:09:30.80 A red light began flashing in my cockpit.
01:09:30.80 --> 01:09:32.52 Low fuel.
01:09:32.52 --> 01:09:33.52 This was it.
01:09:33.52 --> 01:09:39.28 Either land or eject into the frigid seas and see how good our survival suits really were.
01:09:39.28 --> 01:09:42.72 Our life expectancy in the freezing water was five minutes.
01:09:42.72 --> 01:09:43.72 No thanks.
01:09:43.72 --> 01:09:47.52 In the darkness I found the carriers white-wake and followed it until I spotted the drop lights
01:09:47.52 --> 01:09:49.24 on the ship's stern ahead.
01:09:49.24 --> 01:09:51.44 They were above me.
01:09:51.44 --> 01:09:53.20 The landing signal officer told me to climb.
01:09:53.20 --> 01:09:56.48 I pulled the nose up as the fanom's nose top the ramp.
01:09:56.48 --> 01:09:59.56 I pushed the stick forward and an instant later pulled back up.
01:09:59.56 --> 01:10:00.56 This was an old trick.
01:10:00.56 --> 01:10:03.68 A World War II ace named Zika Kormier taught me.
01:10:03.68 --> 01:10:07.56 It saved my mind and Dennis' life that night.
01:10:07.56 --> 01:10:08.80 The fanom touched the deck.
01:10:08.80 --> 01:10:12.04 The tail hook caught an arresting wire and we jerk to his stop.
01:10:12.04 --> 01:10:17.40 As we waited for the deck crew to clear us my knees trembled and my feet shook on the
01:10:17.40 --> 01:10:18.56 brake pedals.
01:10:18.56 --> 01:10:22.56 Of all the flying I'd done to this date this was the most demanding.
01:10:22.56 --> 01:10:27.32 Why somebody in Washington wanted us in the air that night is anyone's guess.
01:10:27.32 --> 01:10:30.96 I can't think of what we accomplished in our 90-minute story.
01:10:30.96 --> 01:10:36.56 Other then perhaps impress the North Korean radar operators who undoubtedly tracked our
01:10:36.56 --> 01:10:38.88 progress through the weather.
01:10:38.88 --> 01:10:41.64 We had wrist our lives for nothing.
01:10:41.64 --> 01:10:48.64 Who were these politicians to play games with our lives?
01:10:48.64 --> 01:10:57.24 That sort of mandated operation happens far too frequently.
01:10:57.24 --> 01:11:02.12 Even today they never been there.
01:11:02.12 --> 01:11:04.40 They couldn't do it.
01:11:04.40 --> 01:11:07.56 They've got the power.
01:11:07.56 --> 01:11:08.56 That's a problem.
01:11:08.56 --> 01:11:18.40 I have emotionally I've tried to think about a book of how to, how to the military historically
01:11:18.40 --> 01:11:24.64 has always been subservient to the politicians in Washington.
01:11:24.64 --> 01:11:33.48 If you look at the entire Vietnam situation, LBJ and Mac Tamara and the way they dictated
01:11:33.48 --> 01:11:35.88 what we did every day.
01:11:35.88 --> 01:11:44.68 I would never, ever, ever convinced me that what they were doing was the end result was
01:11:44.68 --> 01:11:45.68 to win.
01:11:45.68 --> 01:11:48.40 We went along the win.
01:11:48.40 --> 01:11:52.36 I kind of breeze through the section in the opening of this when you're talking about
01:11:52.36 --> 01:11:57.40 the fact that you guys are hitting targets that you're getting from the White House, from
01:11:57.40 --> 01:11:58.72 the Pentagon.
01:11:58.72 --> 01:12:02.000 That's who's doing your target selection.
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000 Totally crazy.
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.36 And they're coming from Magnum or his office.
01:12:07.36 --> 01:12:12.32 We'd find out, they'd come in on a wire about midnight.
01:12:12.32 --> 01:12:17.40 The ships would put out an airplane for the next day.
01:12:17.40 --> 01:12:21.88 But the targets were being dictated from Washington.
01:12:21.88 --> 01:12:30.24 And even since then, they come out that there's been testimony that that same target
01:12:30.24 --> 01:12:34.72 list was sent to the Swiss embassy.
01:12:34.72 --> 01:12:40.28 And the Swiss embassy had related to the North Vietnamese.
01:12:40.28 --> 01:12:50.24 The logic in DC was if they know where we're coming, we won't kill so much collateral
01:12:50.24 --> 01:12:51.24 damage.
01:12:51.24 --> 01:13:00.76 And this is a pretty good case that that actually happened.
01:13:00.76 --> 01:13:04.28 Imagine risking your life every day.
01:13:04.28 --> 01:13:07.44 By the way, the North Vietnamese, they don't care about civilians getting killed.
01:13:07.44 --> 01:13:08.44 They care about their mix.
01:13:08.44 --> 01:13:10.16 Well, that's what they care about.
01:13:10.16 --> 01:13:11.16 That's right.
01:13:11.16 --> 01:13:15.20 And they actually want civilians to get killed because then they can use that as propaganda
01:13:15.20 --> 01:13:16.20 against America.
01:13:16.20 --> 01:13:21.20 We could never, Chaco, we could never understand how they're going to be.
01:13:21.20 --> 01:13:29.08 The next day we'd go into the targets and they'd have moved the mobile same sites and
01:13:29.08 --> 01:13:32.08 AAA that were all on wheels.
01:13:32.08 --> 01:13:35.76 And they moved them into the targets that we were going to hit.
01:13:35.76 --> 01:13:40.68 And that's why I think you'll hear from most of the veterans of flu out there.
01:13:40.68 --> 01:13:45.68 It's probably that tough as air defenses, some in there ever gone against.
01:13:45.68 --> 01:13:47.32 You know, you go into it a little bit here.
01:13:47.32 --> 01:13:48.32 I got to read this part.
01:13:48.32 --> 01:13:52.72 It says, conceived in Washington by Secretary Defense Robert McNamara and approved by President
01:13:52.72 --> 01:13:56.96 Johnson, our bombing campaign was meant not to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war.
01:13:56.96 --> 01:14:01.28 It wasn't designed to demolish their air defense network so we could operate over North
01:14:01.28 --> 01:14:03.28 Vietnam, nom with impunity.
01:14:03.28 --> 01:14:06.08 It had nothing to do with tangible results or victory.
01:14:06.08 --> 01:14:10.48 It had everything to do with sending gradual messages to Hanoi.
01:14:10.48 --> 01:14:14.68 Where I'd expected to be the tip of the spear, we were instead the thumb and forefinger
01:14:14.68 --> 01:14:19.28 of Lyndon Johnson's gradual escalation of pressure on the North Vietnamese.
01:14:19.28 --> 01:14:23.08 We weren't allowed to apply pressure anywhere that it might hurt.
01:14:23.08 --> 01:14:28.32 We were only allowed just to pinch their metaphorical shoulder as a warning that if they
01:14:28.32 --> 01:14:32.000 didn't behave, we would pinch harder.
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.72 What rolling thunder campaign was, the rolling thunder campaign was LBJ's personal
01:14:36.72 --> 01:14:37.72 Billy Club.
01:14:37.72 --> 01:14:41.24 He would send us to smack the North Vietnamese for sending supplies and troops to the
01:14:41.24 --> 01:14:46.92 insurgents, then order unilateral stand-downs known as bombing pauses to give the North
01:14:46.92 --> 01:14:51.96 Vietnamese time to internalize the punishment and heed its lesson.
01:14:51.96 --> 01:14:54.16 But the pauses just gave them time to rearm.
01:14:54.16 --> 01:14:58.36 The American response seemed only to emboldened Hanoi and convinced its leadership that
01:14:58.36 --> 01:15:04.000 we were more worried about the widening war and possibly fighting China or the Soviet Union
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.88 than we were about defeating them.
01:15:05.88 --> 01:15:10.68 They used the bombing pauses to resupply and prepare for the next onslaught.
01:15:10.68 --> 01:15:13.28 A lot of Americans died as a result.
01:15:13.28 --> 01:15:15.80 Some were friends of mine.
01:15:15.80 --> 01:15:21.12 On Yankee Station, the Enterprise Air Wing learned that this, what this meant to individual
01:15:21.12 --> 01:15:26.72 air crews, Johnson McNamara, micro-managed the losing air war from Washington DC, going so
01:15:26.72 --> 01:15:30.20 far as to pick our targets.
01:15:30.20 --> 01:15:34.20 They were perhaps 150 worthwhile things to bomb a North Vietnam.
01:15:34.20 --> 01:15:38.96 Air fields, military bases, supply facilities, power plants, bridges, rail centers, oil, lubricant
01:15:38.96 --> 01:15:43.52 facilities, a few steel mills, and of course, high-fong's port facilities.
01:15:43.52 --> 01:15:45.20 Am I saying that right?
01:15:45.20 --> 01:15:46.20 High-fong?
01:15:46.20 --> 01:15:49.96 As both China and Russia wanted to be Hanoi's primary alley, they each tried to
01:15:49.96 --> 01:15:52.04 one up each other with military support.
01:15:52.04 --> 01:15:57.80 Large convoys of weapons and warm material flowed across the Chinese border to Vietnam.
01:15:57.80 --> 01:16:02.76 While the Russians have evolved tanks and surfaced to air missiles, systems via ships
01:16:02.76 --> 01:16:08.92 into the high-fong harbor, the enemy, thus had sanctuary to bring in what ever was
01:16:08.92 --> 01:16:12.000 needed for years.
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.60 Afraid of escalating the war, the Johnson administration refused to sanction attacks on
01:16:16.60 --> 01:16:19.000 high-fong harbor or the shipping there.
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.36 As we started to fly missions up North, up North, we would pass those cargo ships as they
01:16:23.36 --> 01:16:26.32 waited their turn to off-load at the docks.
01:16:26.32 --> 01:16:32.08 We could see their decks crammed with weatherized migs and surfaced to air missiles that
01:16:32.08 --> 01:16:37.36 would be shortly used against us, but we couldn't hit them.
01:16:37.36 --> 01:16:39.28 We couldn't mind the harbor either.
01:16:39.28 --> 01:16:40.28 What a tragedy.
01:16:40.28 --> 01:16:46.000 The simple execution of an off-the-shelf aerial mining plan long before perfected during World
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.32 War II and carried out in three days could have shut down that big port.
01:16:50.32 --> 01:16:56.68 The only one of its kind in North Vietnam, but the word from the White House was no.
01:16:56.68 --> 01:17:00.32 Those big surface-to-air missiles as large as telephone poles would spear up into the sky
01:17:00.32 --> 01:17:03.52 after our airport, homing on their radar signatures.
01:17:03.52 --> 01:17:05.36 They took a heavy toll.
01:17:05.36 --> 01:17:11.96 We could sell them bomb the missile sites for fear we might kill their Russian advisors.
01:17:11.96 --> 01:17:15.32 When the North Vietnamese began flying Russian and Chinese-built make fighters, the Navy
01:17:15.32 --> 01:17:22.48 and Air Force asked Washington for permission to bomb their airfields, the request was denied.
01:17:22.48 --> 01:17:28.12 Categories of targets that could not be struck under any circumstances included dams, hydroelectric
01:17:28.12 --> 01:17:31.04 plants, fishing boats, sand pans, and houseboats.
01:17:31.04 --> 01:17:33.92 They also included significantly populated areas.
01:17:33.92 --> 01:17:38.56 After seeing the military value of these restrictions and North Vietnamese, placed most of
01:17:38.56 --> 01:17:44.36 their Sam support facilities and other valuable cargo near Hanoi and high-fong places where
01:17:44.36 --> 01:17:47.40 we were forbidden to strike.
01:17:47.40 --> 01:17:51.72 The airfields around Hanoi became sanctuaries for mix.
01:17:51.72 --> 01:17:58.20 The commander in chief of the US Pacific Command, Admiral Ulysses S. Grant Sharp, who had overall
01:17:58.20 --> 01:18:03.56 responsibility for the air war, urged the joint chiefs to have to lift the crippling restrictions.
01:18:03.56 --> 01:18:08.40 Meanwhile, the enemy fighter pilots could sit on their runways in their planes without fear
01:18:08.40 --> 01:18:14.04 of attack, waiting to scramble when our bombers showed up.
01:18:14.04 --> 01:18:17.44 Eventually Johnson and McNamara cave to the pressure and allowed strikes on the airfields
01:18:17.44 --> 01:18:22.80 yet they might be mismatched even this, picking specific airfields and leaving others out of
01:18:22.80 --> 01:18:23.80 bounds.
01:18:23.80 --> 01:18:31.80 It was always necessary to virtually beg target authorization out of Washington, bit by peace
01:18:31.80 --> 01:18:37.16 Admiral Sharp wrote, instead of letting the navy launch a blitz that might break the
01:18:37.16 --> 01:18:42.48 bath back of the North Vietnamese air force, we hate a few air bases at a time while leaving
01:18:42.48 --> 01:18:52.64 the rest unscathed.
01:18:52.64 --> 01:18:53.84 I got to read this too.
01:18:53.84 --> 01:18:55.40 It was a setup for failure, you say.
01:18:55.40 --> 01:18:56.76 And it got a lot worse.
01:18:56.76 --> 01:19:00.24 Those rules of engagement negated the way we had trained to fight in the air.
01:19:00.24 --> 01:19:05.000 The value of RF4 phantoms was their ability to destroy airplanes and enemy planes from
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.68 beyond visual range.
01:19:06.68 --> 01:19:11.28 The aim seven sparrow was the ultimate expression of that new way of fighting.
01:19:11.28 --> 01:19:15.68 Track and lock with the radar system loose the missile from 10 miles out and say goodbye
01:19:15.68 --> 01:19:16.68 to the make.
01:19:16.68 --> 01:19:18.92 This is how the navy trained us to fight.
01:19:18.92 --> 01:19:23.76 We abandoned dogfight training because of the navy's faith in missile technology.
01:19:23.76 --> 01:19:27.28 Most of our air crews didn't know most of our air crews didn't know how to fight any
01:19:27.28 --> 01:19:29.000 other way.
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.76 We had our own rules of engagement kept us from using what we were talking.
01:19:32.76 --> 01:19:39.16 The rules of engagement specifically prohibited firing from beyond visual range.
01:19:39.16 --> 01:19:43.60 To shoot a missile at an aircraft a fighter pilot needed to first visually confirm it was
01:19:43.60 --> 01:19:46.16 a mig and not a friendly plane.
01:19:46.16 --> 01:19:50.40 The thought of an inadvertent or accidental shoot down of our brothers was of course intolerable.
01:19:50.40 --> 01:19:53.000 It did happen sadly in the heat of combat.
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.84 Yet three years along the training squadron in California was still teaching long range
01:19:57.84 --> 01:20:01.52 to intercept tactics to the exclusion of everything else.
01:20:01.52 --> 01:20:06.24 Our training was not applicable to the air war in Vietnam.
01:20:06.24 --> 01:20:09.60 This played directly into the kind of the fight that make pilots wanted.
01:20:09.60 --> 01:20:13.16 The make 17 was a nimble fighter armed with cannons but no missiles.
01:20:13.16 --> 01:20:17.92 It was an old school derived from the Soviet lessons learned in the Korean war with such
01:20:17.92 --> 01:20:23.08 a plane the North Vietnamese needed to get in close and track our planes with their gun sites.
01:20:23.08 --> 01:20:28.000 They would sometimes wait to open fire until they were within 600 feet.
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000 Here we were trained in knock planes down at 10 miles.
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.16 The F4 carried only missiles.
01:20:33.16 --> 01:20:38.000 It did not have an internal gun because contractors in the Pentagon believe the age of the
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.80 dark fight was over.
01:20:39.80 --> 01:20:44.68 We brought our expensive high tech into this knife fight in a phone booth.
01:20:44.68 --> 01:20:51.12 The result, the make pilots scored a lot more heavily than they should have.
01:20:51.12 --> 01:20:58.16 The good read and again, I'm even when I'm reading chunks like that.
01:20:58.16 --> 01:21:03.84 I'm skipping over sections, you know, just to the history and you know, from a leadership
01:21:03.84 --> 01:21:06.96 perspective, this is a nightmare.
01:21:06.96 --> 01:21:11.40 It's a nightmare that there's no connection from the people that are making decisions
01:21:11.40 --> 01:21:13.56 to the folks that are on the frontline fighting.
01:21:13.56 --> 01:21:15.32 They're not listening to the feedback.
01:21:15.32 --> 01:21:16.96 It's a disaster.
01:21:16.96 --> 01:21:23.96 Their motives or their motives are different.
01:21:23.96 --> 01:21:26.96 You know, I really had thought about a book.
01:21:26.96 --> 01:21:28.96 I'm not good enough to write it.
01:21:28.96 --> 01:21:29.96 I don't think.
01:21:29.96 --> 01:21:35.60 But you've got the industry building weapons.
01:21:35.60 --> 01:21:39.96 Whatever they are, airplanes, park, and rules systems, everything.
01:21:39.96 --> 01:21:42.20 The industry is building them.
01:21:42.20 --> 01:21:44.96 What's their motive, profit?
01:21:44.96 --> 01:21:48.92 Then the American weapons, okay, I'll give them that.
01:21:48.92 --> 01:21:55.40 But mainly profit motive, then you can keep coming down the politicians.
01:21:55.40 --> 01:21:57.68 We know what their motives are like.
01:21:57.68 --> 01:22:02.56 And you come down to the poor guy who's flying in the machine.
01:22:02.56 --> 01:22:09.80 If it doesn't do the job that's required in the operational scenario you're involved in,
01:22:09.80 --> 01:22:11.52 you can lose.
01:22:11.52 --> 01:22:16.28 And losing is second best in tactics.
01:22:16.28 --> 01:22:18.28 Yeah, losing is dying.
01:22:18.28 --> 01:22:19.28 That's right.
01:22:19.28 --> 01:22:20.28 Exactly.
01:22:20.28 --> 01:22:27.12 You know, the other thing, and I go after Robert McNamara a lot, you say this.
01:22:27.12 --> 01:22:29.28 Robert McNamara is a numbers guy.
01:22:29.28 --> 01:22:32.92 And this is the thing, there's secondary effects.
01:22:32.92 --> 01:22:41.20 There's tertiary effects that happen when people are motivated by certain certain
01:22:41.20 --> 01:22:42.20 metrics.
01:22:42.20 --> 01:22:44.40 So here's what happens.
01:22:44.40 --> 01:22:46.80 Robert McNamara was a numbers guy.
01:22:46.80 --> 01:22:50.60 Under him, the Pentagon measured success in the ground war by the body count.
01:22:50.60 --> 01:22:52.000 Can you believe that?
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:58.28 In the air, the air, the metric was the number of sorties flown over North Vietnam.
01:22:58.28 --> 01:23:01.20 One sortie equals one plane flying one mission.
01:23:01.20 --> 01:23:04.40 A ten plane raid resulted in ten sorties.
01:23:04.40 --> 01:23:06.64 This became a delusional world.
01:23:06.64 --> 01:23:09.52 A sortie counted in the total.
01:23:09.52 --> 01:23:13.76 Even if our bombers were forced to dump their payloads short of the target, which often
01:23:13.76 --> 01:23:19.88 happened when Meg's appeared, facing pressure to generate sorties, the carriers were worn
01:23:19.88 --> 01:23:21.20 and ragged.
01:23:21.20 --> 01:23:25.60 Aircraft handling crews worked 12 hours on 12 hours off, spotting and respawning the
01:23:25.60 --> 01:23:30.52 decks, launching strikes, recovering aircraft, arming and refueling the birds, racing
01:23:30.52 --> 01:23:34.08 to meet the sortie rate required of them.
01:23:34.08 --> 01:23:39.68 Such pilot flew twice a day with each mission taking several hours to brief and debrief.
01:23:39.68 --> 01:23:45.52 We flew to the edge of fatigue and beyond aviators who were shot down and recovered were
01:23:45.52 --> 01:23:50.48 back in action in a few short days.
01:23:50.48 --> 01:23:54.88 While the tempo took a heavy toll, it also led to the needless tragedies, including
01:23:54.88 --> 01:24:00.40 major fires aboard our carriers, the results of exhaustive crews making mistakes, scores
01:24:00.40 --> 01:24:04.48 of sailors and aviators died in those accidents and the fires on two carriers were serious
01:24:04.48 --> 01:24:07.76 enough to risk the loss of the ship.
01:24:07.76 --> 01:24:12.56 We were losing good men needlessly in the push to maintain the sortie rate.
01:24:12.56 --> 01:24:15.28 Why competition between services?
01:24:15.28 --> 01:24:19.92 With the Air Force and Navy battling fiercely for appropriations, both were determined to
01:24:19.92 --> 01:24:25.16 outdo the sorties the other flew.
01:24:25.16 --> 01:24:31.88 To put in perspective for your audience, I want to tell you a story.
01:24:31.88 --> 01:24:38.88 The skank that's in there in the story was up during the rescue of the Pueblo and
01:24:38.88 --> 01:24:44.52 skank Rimsson was a squirting commander.
01:24:44.52 --> 01:24:51.40 It's a front row guy never took a mission that he wouldn't lead and if they were tough,
01:24:51.40 --> 01:24:53.32 he was always there.
01:24:53.32 --> 01:25:03.08 That's why we were out together on that particular word back down in Vietnam during that same
01:25:03.08 --> 01:25:05.08 cruise.
01:25:05.08 --> 01:25:13.72 I wasn't with him this day, but this tells you the quality of the guy in the naval aviation.
01:25:13.72 --> 01:25:20.20 He's in over the beach in North Vietnam and he's a low-alditude and a rifle shot goes
01:25:20.20 --> 01:25:22.08 through the cockpit.
01:25:22.08 --> 01:25:24.80 He gets a flashy part of his legs.
01:25:24.80 --> 01:25:33.12 Both legs went through, come out the other side, lost in the console on the left side.
01:25:33.12 --> 01:25:35.64 He shot up in two legs.
01:25:35.64 --> 01:25:43.80 He retits down, pulls the garter's up, the garter's hold for the ejection seat, their straps
01:25:43.80 --> 01:25:46.28 that go around your calves.
01:25:46.28 --> 01:25:54.76 He brings him up, he turns his legs above his wounds, flies 140 miles back to the enterprise
01:25:54.76 --> 01:25:57.48 and lands aboard.
01:25:57.48 --> 01:25:58.80 This is T.S.
01:25:58.80 --> 01:26:03.40 Bremson, skank Rimsson, the squirting commander.
01:26:03.40 --> 01:26:09.28 He lands aboard the medic skitty moth at cockpit taking down the dock sewing up.
01:26:09.28 --> 01:26:16.96 Two weeks later, Jaco, he was back in combat flying with his squirting.
01:26:16.96 --> 01:26:24.72 He refused to be met with him and there are plenty of mothers like him.
01:26:24.72 --> 01:26:31.56 I know in your world, both of you, that you come out of there upon the guys like that,
01:26:31.56 --> 01:26:41.32 a great Americans, but they are poorly officiated up above them in many instances.
01:26:41.32 --> 01:26:47.28 When you get into, when you hit the part about how top-gone was put together, we were
01:26:47.28 --> 01:26:49.80 exposed to guys like this.
01:26:49.80 --> 01:26:55.000 We knew what the answers needed to be, some moment to it, it really knew.
01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:06.20 That's when I came from Genova, Lecha, Alex Varaeshu, Texanel, Skank Rimsson, Mentoring.
01:27:06.20 --> 01:27:13.24 We knew what the gun dancers were and they sure weren't sitting in the earring in a pentagon
01:27:13.24 --> 01:27:16.000 or in Congress.
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:24.56 In this section here, you kind of detail the chapter title is Yankee Station Education.
01:27:24.56 --> 01:27:30.48 And it gives a good overview and again, I'm jumping ahead of some of the information
01:27:30.48 --> 01:27:33.68 you cover, but you say, day after day, we flew missions from Yankee Station to Hammer
01:27:33.68 --> 01:27:35.44 targets of questionable value.
01:27:35.44 --> 01:27:38.84 We bomb truck convoyes when we could find them on search and destroy mission.
01:27:38.84 --> 01:27:40.56 They move mostly at night and total darkness.
01:27:40.56 --> 01:27:44.40 We bomb supply, depose, and occasionally, when after power plants, as well as military
01:27:44.40 --> 01:27:48.08 barracks, long flattened by the squadron to have deployed before us.
01:27:48.08 --> 01:27:49.64 We went after bridges and sam sites.
01:27:49.64 --> 01:27:53.84 Very occasionally, we received permission from Washington to hit mega airfields around
01:27:53.84 --> 01:27:54.84 Hanoi.
01:27:54.84 --> 01:27:58.32 The F4 was designed from the ground up to be a mock-plus interceptor.
01:27:58.32 --> 01:28:01.76 It was supposed to be the bane of all Soviet built strategic bombers.
01:28:01.76 --> 01:28:07.20 Over Vietnam, the phantom became perhaps the most versatile multi-role aircraft America has ever
01:28:07.20 --> 01:28:08.68 produced.
01:28:08.68 --> 01:28:14.20 Still with its interceptor heart, it functioned as an escort fighter, utility strike bomber
01:28:14.20 --> 01:28:20.64 and south of the D. Militarizone, a close air-support aircraft.
01:28:20.64 --> 01:28:24.36 We were doing it all, learning on the job how to best carry out our missions.
01:28:24.36 --> 01:28:26.08 They were never the same.
01:28:26.08 --> 01:28:31.84 But the two days, over the north, usually one at night, left us worn out.
01:28:31.84 --> 01:28:34.92 The lack of quality sleep could also put our nerves on edge at time.
01:28:34.92 --> 01:28:36.40 We grew easily frustrated.
01:28:36.40 --> 01:28:39.24 Some people started to withdraw into the pressure.
01:28:39.24 --> 01:28:41.76 The exhaustion, the grief over losing so many friends.
01:28:41.76 --> 01:28:43.36 This didn't happen in my squadron.
01:28:43.36 --> 01:28:48.08 Skank and the other senior pilots set the example by flying almost all the difficult missions
01:28:48.08 --> 01:28:52.48 with the junior crews while never griping about the targets or the rules of engagement.
01:28:52.48 --> 01:28:56.04 They were great pilots as well as tremendous inspirations to all of us.
01:28:56.04 --> 01:29:01.92 Skank kept us focused and working as a team, taking care of each of us as we flew daily
01:29:01.92 --> 01:29:02.92 into harm's way.
01:29:02.92 --> 01:29:06.32 In our earwing, all the squadrons were led by example.
01:29:06.32 --> 01:29:09.60 It wasn't always that way as some other outfits experienced.
01:29:09.60 --> 01:29:16.000 We were losing guys to Sam's, Flaq, and even Migs, whose pilots well directed by radar,
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.68 would launch slashing attacks into our formations.
01:29:19.68 --> 01:29:23.32 At the end of January, the North Vietnamese Army launched a major attack against a series
01:29:23.32 --> 01:29:29.92 of special forces outposts and the marine fire base at K-Song, which sat up on top of a flat
01:29:29.92 --> 01:29:32.84 top tail with all sides exposed.
01:29:32.84 --> 01:29:39.40 We launched late that afternoon and flew 200 miles to our marshalling station above K-Song.
01:29:39.40 --> 01:29:44.32 With the battle filling the surrounding valleys with gray box smoke, we had only glimpses
01:29:44.32 --> 01:29:45.88 of what was happening below.
01:29:45.88 --> 01:29:48.28 The airfield was a scene of carnage.
01:29:48.28 --> 01:29:53.16 Burnt out aircraft laid pushed to a side of the runway, victims of mortar broads.
01:29:53.16 --> 01:29:58.44 The base itself looked like a lunar landscape, with thousands of shell creators overlapping
01:29:58.44 --> 01:30:00.56 in the reddish, soft soil.
01:30:00.56 --> 01:30:05.44 I checked in with the marine forward air controller, whose job it was to guide us on the target.
01:30:05.44 --> 01:30:09.16 He was down there right amongst those young American kids and during the artillery
01:30:09.16 --> 01:30:11.88 broads is a night assault alongside them.
01:30:11.88 --> 01:30:15.76 With his radios and expertise, he was their fist of God.
01:30:15.76 --> 01:30:21.32 He was probably a marine aviator as well, so he spoke our language and understood our perspective.
01:30:21.32 --> 01:30:25.36 The forward air controller heard my check in radio call and responded immediately.
01:30:25.36 --> 01:30:28.000 The situation sounded dire from his description.
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.44 North Vietnamese troops were massing just beyond the wire for another night assault, and
01:30:32.44 --> 01:30:36.40 he wanted me to hit thing with everything under my wings before darkness gave them the
01:30:36.40 --> 01:30:38.76 opportunity to attack again.
01:30:38.76 --> 01:30:43.80 The late day offered a rare cloudless sky, the blue stretching above me contrasted with the ugly
01:30:43.80 --> 01:30:47.96 coils of smoke and flame filling the valley under my phantoms nose.
01:30:47.96 --> 01:30:51.48 After receiving my instructions, I started down to begin my run.
01:30:51.48 --> 01:30:55.64 Keep your speed up, 500 knots, 400 feet, they'll be shooting at you.
01:30:55.64 --> 01:30:57.48 Called the forward air controller.
01:30:57.48 --> 01:30:59.56 Drop all your snakes on my signal.
01:30:59.56 --> 01:31:04.56 Remember, there are marines on the wire, just off your left wing.
01:31:04.56 --> 01:31:07.44 I leveled off at 400 feet, going 500 knots.
01:31:07.44 --> 01:31:11.04 The phantom spread through the clouds of smoke, from the hills to a right small arms
01:31:11.04 --> 01:31:16.000 fire erupted in my back cedar, Dennis Duffy and I could see the muzzle flashes.
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:22.000 Moments later, red orange tracers lace the sky ahead of us and level with us.
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.92 With my high speed, I wasn't so concerned with taking hints from the North Vietnamese troops
01:31:25.92 --> 01:31:30.84 on the right of us whose tracers were horizontal, but I was terrified of blowing the run
01:31:30.84 --> 01:31:36.48 and dropping my snakes on the marines near the wire by accident.
01:31:36.48 --> 01:31:42.000 Or an inexperienced navy pilot did just that by accident and wounded some of our men.
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:46.60 The idea of killing Americans with a misplaced bomb, well, I knew I would never get over
01:31:46.60 --> 01:31:47.60 that if it happened.
01:31:47.60 --> 01:31:51.44 I listened carefully to every word that forward air controller said.
01:31:51.44 --> 01:31:56.16 If I wasn't exactly level, the bombs might fall right or left of the target area depending
01:31:56.16 --> 01:31:58.56 on where my wings were to the horizon.
01:31:58.56 --> 01:32:02.72 Holding steady while every bad guy with an AK-47 seemed to be shooting at me was no easy
01:32:02.72 --> 01:32:03.72 feet.
01:32:03.72 --> 01:32:06.52 Back it was the toughest flying I'd ever done.
01:32:06.52 --> 01:32:11.44 I checked my heading, wings level, a second later the forward air controller called
01:32:11.44 --> 01:32:13.16 drop, drop, drop.
01:32:13.16 --> 01:32:19.24 I pickled the Marquee de Tues, the F4 lurched upward as 6,000 pounds of bombs came off our hard
01:32:19.24 --> 01:32:21.96 points and began falling toward the ground.
01:32:21.96 --> 01:32:25.64 Simultaneously I pushed the throttle further and lit the burner.
01:32:25.64 --> 01:32:32.12 The fanom's twin J79 engines responded and we pulled with 5G's back to where we belonged
01:32:32.12 --> 01:32:33.80 far above the fray.
01:32:33.80 --> 01:32:39.40 Duff my back's seat or said, let's all ask Kim Osabe as we climbed my throat constricted,
01:32:39.40 --> 01:32:43.56 heart filled with dread while we waited to hear from the forward air controller.
01:32:43.56 --> 01:32:48.48 Toughest part of the mission is waiting for the results from the big, grunt FAC.
01:32:48.48 --> 01:32:51.44 Oh shit, did I just kill a bunch of Marines?
01:32:51.44 --> 01:32:53.20 No word from the air controller.
01:32:53.20 --> 01:32:57.16 The ultimate or need or kneel spun as we seared through 3000 feet.
01:32:57.16 --> 01:32:58.52 The seconds ticked off.
01:32:58.52 --> 01:33:03.32 No word behind me Dennis was twisted in his ejection seat trying to see where our bombs
01:33:03.32 --> 01:33:04.32 landed.
01:33:04.32 --> 01:33:06.92 Oh shit, the radio filled with static.
01:33:06.92 --> 01:33:13.84 Then the forward air controller's voice shouted, great run, great run, right on target.
01:33:13.84 --> 01:33:19.16 The Marines held and as a joint army navy, as a joint army marine and south Vietnamese
01:33:19.16 --> 01:33:24.60 rescue force battled up its way, its way up highway 9 to break the siege.
01:33:24.60 --> 01:33:29.64 The Enterprise Air Wing returned to its regularly scheduled programming over North Vietnam.
01:33:29.64 --> 01:33:31.64 We flew that day and night.
01:33:31.64 --> 01:33:33.84 We flew day and night in any kind of weather.
01:33:33.84 --> 01:33:38.36 We flew alpha strikes which were large on wheeled the raids of 30 or more planes.
01:33:38.36 --> 01:33:43.12 We have force provided escort against the mid threat or went to suppress air defenses while
01:33:43.12 --> 01:33:46.80 a 4 skyhawk attack planes struck targets.
01:33:46.80 --> 01:33:53.000 We flew 2 and 4 plane armed recumissions searching for anything worthwhile, Washington allowed
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.000 us to bomb.
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.76 There's not a person that knows anything about the military that hasn't heard about
01:34:00.76 --> 01:34:03.92 the case on the siege at case on.
01:34:03.92 --> 01:34:09.92 Wow, that's a crazy story from your perspective hearing it from your end.
01:34:09.92 --> 01:34:13.92 Well, it was so desperate.
01:34:13.92 --> 01:34:17.24 The siege was so bad by that time.
01:34:17.24 --> 01:34:19.56 They actually brought us in.
01:34:19.56 --> 01:34:25.08 The Marines at two lines and they were flying closer or sub-ort two.
01:34:25.08 --> 01:34:28.72 We didn't do that much of it navy guys.
01:34:28.72 --> 01:34:32.52 But it was, I had seen pictures of it.
01:34:32.52 --> 01:34:36.64 Recky pictures and so forth, reconnaissance.
01:34:36.64 --> 01:34:44.56 But to see it up close and then hear some guys down there on the wire with the guys who
01:34:44.56 --> 01:34:53.80 it endured a night in a major night at Vance by the North Vietnamese couple days before.
01:34:53.80 --> 01:34:56.88 I mean, this is serious business.
01:34:56.88 --> 01:35:01.60 Dave, you got to experience that.
01:35:01.60 --> 01:35:07.80 How good does it feel when you're on the ground and you're talking to somebody and you know
01:35:07.80 --> 01:35:11.60 you know what to say, you speak their language and then when you're in the air and you hear
01:35:11.60 --> 01:35:14.52 that person's voice and you're all right, I got you.
01:35:14.52 --> 01:35:22.44 I mean, listen to this is just, I mean, I'm kind of choked up just hearing you tell the story.
01:35:22.44 --> 01:35:28.68 I was, I was so lucky in my career to spend so much great time flying but that I got
01:35:28.68 --> 01:35:36.04 to live with Jocco's guys for about six months to run in the other side and I remember
01:35:36.04 --> 01:35:40.20 being told that we would, that type one cast was dead.
01:35:40.20 --> 01:35:43.04 I remember being told you'll never do it.
01:35:43.04 --> 01:35:46.92 And so even some of the same institutional things you dealt with and to be down there talking
01:35:46.92 --> 01:35:53.52 on my old squadron mates, doing type one gun runs in situations that I never thought I'd
01:35:53.52 --> 01:35:58.12 be and but how good it felt to do something to be honest, we didn't really want to be
01:35:58.12 --> 01:36:02.000 doing but to be down there and have guys that I knew from my old squadron is coming in
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:07.40 doing gun runs and when those missions were over to go back and think man, like you said,
01:36:07.40 --> 01:36:13.72 I mean, the serious business, the fact that the Marine Corps let me do that, there was a lot
01:36:13.72 --> 01:36:18.64 of me that didn't really want to but that was the most powerful thing ever did in my 23-year
01:36:18.64 --> 01:36:25.08 career was use aircraft as fact to keep soldiers Marines and seals alive which to this
01:36:25.08 --> 01:36:26.08 day.
01:36:26.08 --> 01:36:30.000 How long were you on the ground or I didn't, I was a fact for one year I did seven months
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.76 in Ramadi about six of it was what Jocco's team.
01:36:33.76 --> 01:36:39.96 Hey, listen, yeah, don't take for one second that I want you to think that what that story
01:36:39.96 --> 01:36:45.92 just told was my life, please don't and don't think that anything we did was remotely
01:36:45.92 --> 01:36:50.68 comparable to you, you know, what the guys on case on and what the guys in Vietnam, you know,
01:36:50.68 --> 01:36:53.84 we, we, you know, just not comparable.
01:36:53.84 --> 01:36:54.84 It's just not comparable.
01:36:54.84 --> 01:36:59.16 It's not a day even I and the rest of the guys in echelon front spend a lot of time talking
01:36:59.16 --> 01:37:06.36 about the fact that our combat experience is it's a real stretch to use the word combat
01:37:06.36 --> 01:37:10.92 experience when you compare it to a lot of the guys I've had on this podcast and a lot
01:37:10.92 --> 01:37:16.52 of, you know, and obviously hundreds of thousands of of service men and women that have
01:37:16.52 --> 01:37:23.80 done things infinitely, harder and more dangerous and with what much more sacrifice than
01:37:23.80 --> 01:37:31.72 anything that we did and that's why we just try and, you know, capture some of the lessons.
01:37:31.72 --> 01:37:41.72 I understand, but I also believe the most humble, most humble whether you're flying, whether
01:37:41.72 --> 01:37:48.44 you're a seal or a grunt and a core that most humble are usually the best warriors.
01:37:48.44 --> 01:37:55.000 I'm really find that in naval aviation, you know, rempton never would ever.
01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:01.88 You never even in the bar at night you'd never, you rempton tell that story upon himself.
01:38:01.88 --> 01:38:05.24 They're humble guys, but they're great Americans.
01:38:05.24 --> 01:38:10.76 Indeed, and that's the same way, you know, you get down, you listen and I look at a lot of
01:38:10.76 --> 01:38:20.76 your podcasts, a single event in your life, your jacco or your David, a single event can get you killed.
01:38:21.96 --> 01:38:28.28 Every event that you were involved in in your time and the service is important.
01:38:29.48 --> 01:38:35.48 You made it through that single event and you go on to the next one and that's why,
01:38:35.48 --> 01:38:41.72 well, I would get into it, but that's how the brotherhood, you know, why we top gun guys all
01:38:41.72 --> 01:38:48.52 call each other bro. There were original nine bros, we're coming to that.
01:38:50.20 --> 01:39:00.68 But rather that grew 600 bros. He's one of them and that's because they deal in each other's life
01:39:00.68 --> 01:39:09.000 day after day after year after year, if they're good. Yeah, now you've heard my lecture.
01:39:11.24 --> 01:39:17.08 Well, that was, you know, and I just kind of rattled off all the different types of missions that you
01:39:17.08 --> 01:39:22.68 guys were doing and I'm going to fast forward a little bit here. It says the missions continued
01:39:23.56 --> 01:39:29.64 as did the losses. There were nights, I got back to my bunk struggling with despair,
01:39:29.64 --> 01:39:34.68 seeing friends die as never an easy thing. At times you think you grow hard to it.
01:39:34.68 --> 01:39:40.20 Other times their deaths open wounds that the heart simply cannot heal. On those nights,
01:39:40.20 --> 01:39:45.80 I would crawl under the covers and lay there, unable to sleep despite my exhaustion, mind racing.
01:39:46.92 --> 01:39:51.000 Could we have done anything different? Could you have gotten out and we just didn't see the
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.84 shoot? Fortunately none of them were from my squadron. I tried not to think about their families
01:39:56.84 --> 01:40:01.88 back home, but the faces of wives and kids would sometimes allude those efforts and they would
01:40:01.88 --> 01:40:07.88 come back to me in a rush. I found through my Navy career that some men revel in the challenge
01:40:07.88 --> 01:40:14.36 and rush of combat. That pace of off the Vietnam, it was their hunting ground. Me, I never got to that
01:40:14.36 --> 01:40:19.72 point. Combat was a responsibility, even a sacred duty. I took it very seriously, of course, but I
01:40:19.72 --> 01:40:25.72 never liked it. Those men I would never see again. Those families I would see too soon again.
01:40:25.72 --> 01:40:31.72 They were the cost of all that adrenaline rush. Others craved. That was a burden I couldn't
01:40:31.72 --> 01:40:38.28 carry and love at the same time. The enemy always had a say. And that was the wild card in combat.
01:40:38.28 --> 01:40:42.28 You could do everything right. Your division could do everything right. Your chain of command could
01:40:42.28 --> 01:40:48.12 make every decision and lead from the front like Skank did. Yet we faced cunning, devoted, and
01:40:48.12 --> 01:40:54.28 frankly courageous enemy who found ways to surprise us with new tricks. On those sleepless nights,
01:40:54.28 --> 01:41:00.68 my brain refusing to shut off. I would think of those empty wardrobe chairs. We lost some
01:41:00.68 --> 01:41:05.80 excellent pilots. All the talent in the world was not enough when fate called your number.
01:41:11.88 --> 01:41:17.000 You close this section out saying, in those sleepless nights, which most of us out on Yaki
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:23.72 station had, we did our best not to think of home. You could make you cautious hesitant in the
01:41:23.72 --> 01:41:29.24 air, get you killed. If you were wrought wise, you never looked past the next dawn.
01:41:30.12 --> 01:41:36.04 Some combat vets would tell the new guys, assume you're never coming back, truly believe it,
01:41:36.84 --> 01:41:41.64 and you will make it home. It was a psychological paradox of battle.
01:41:41.64 --> 01:41:57.08 Yeah, there's a weird challenge. For a grunt, you're there. You're sleeping in the dirt,
01:41:57.08 --> 01:42:03.40 you're in danger. You get a use to it, you get numb to it, it's the reality.
01:42:03.40 --> 01:42:11.56 For you guys to be back safe on an aircraft carrier and then load into your aircraft and launch,
01:42:11.56 --> 01:42:16.68 that's a different cycle. And frankly, thinking about the guys that you lose,
01:42:18.12 --> 01:42:25.64 you have less time to do that on the ground. You're actively engaged. Even when we come back
01:42:25.64 --> 01:42:31.24 to base, we're planning for the next mission, and you know you're going out. But for you guys,
01:42:31.24 --> 01:42:36.52 like, you know, even if you do two missions, even if it takes you 12 hours, you got 12
01:42:36.52 --> 01:42:41.56 more hours in that day, you got to deal with. And that's a different, it's a different psychological
01:42:41.56 --> 01:42:47.40 challenge, I think. And the way you described it, it sounded like a different psychological challenge.
01:42:47.40 --> 01:42:55.16 And I will say, for me, the hardest part of doing a mission is waiting to go.
01:42:55.88 --> 01:42:59.64 That's the only time where I'd be like, all right, what, you know, that's one of my mind would
01:42:59.64 --> 01:43:04.20 start to race of did I think of everything? What go wrong? That's once you're on the mission,
01:43:05.56 --> 01:43:11.16 you're in the zone, you know, you're, I'm not, I'm not thinking about anything but getting the job done.
01:43:11.16 --> 01:43:16.52 But the hours before, four hours before, and you guys were in the perpetual cycle of
01:43:17.40 --> 01:43:20.52 waiting to go and not knowing if it was going to be your time or not.
01:43:20.52 --> 01:43:32.28 Well, that's the profession and evaluation. Nightcare landings always are exciting.
01:43:35.24 --> 01:43:41.80 And you had an opportunity to get a big, but it didn't work out, what happened with that one?
01:43:41.80 --> 01:43:52.52 Um, Remson and I and two other guys were vectored in hot ready to shoot and a follow my leader
01:43:53.32 --> 01:43:57.48 at 12 miles, we're all locked up, a good, ready light or need fire.
01:43:59.40 --> 01:44:05.32 And it was very rare that we didn't, we weren't bound by the rules of engagement.
01:44:05.32 --> 01:44:13.80 We were cleared to fire 12 miles, Remson decides, we're going to sweeten the pot. So we go to 10 miles,
01:44:13.80 --> 01:44:20.76 eight miles, and about 10 miles, we're going pretty fast, you know what I mean?
01:44:22.12 --> 01:44:30.44 We get the call of salvo, salvo, salvo, salvo, from a red ground, which was the offshore air
01:44:30.44 --> 01:44:38.68 controller and salvo means get out of there and they don't specify why. So Remson, we cross,
01:44:38.68 --> 01:44:46.36 turned it, turned away and let these make 21s, which were coming down the pipe at us.
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:54.36 We had to, we had to not fire. Now, two things could have happened. They could have been,
01:44:54.36 --> 01:45:00.84 friend, at least, red crowns made mistakes on occasion. It's radar interpretation,
01:45:01.56 --> 01:45:09.56 some distance. So that was immediate reaction. And then we hear, I was to God to hurt it.
01:45:09.56 --> 01:45:15.64 The thunder go over the top, there's a rolling thunder going over the top. And the long beach
01:45:15.64 --> 01:45:26.04 had fired Taylor's missiles and it shot him right over the top of us. You talk about being angry.
01:45:27.16 --> 01:45:33.24 We got back to the boat and landed and found out what it was. And they shot down one and got
01:45:33.24 --> 01:45:42.76 a probable one a second, make 21, which belonged to Remson and better. It's a, it's a crap
01:45:42.76 --> 01:45:53.24 shoot. Yeah, you know, on a given day, do you get a chance that you train in years war? And
01:45:53.24 --> 01:45:58.04 that one our day, so you want to get ready for the next day, like you say.
01:46:02.60 --> 01:46:09.08 Eventually, you get to this point and again, I'm fast forwarding through stories and
01:46:09.08 --> 01:46:18.12 details and personnel just awesome history. You get to this point. We were worn out, beat up,
01:46:18.12 --> 01:46:26.12 and bitter. Between the end of February and the end of June, our 100 man air wing had lost 13
01:46:26.12 --> 01:46:33.96 killed or captured. 10 bombers on F4 and a vigilante reconnaissance plan playing. Something was
01:46:33.96 --> 01:46:39.80 very, very wrong. If we were going to regain the dominance that was Naval Aviation's birthright,
01:46:39.80 --> 01:46:44.76 we would need to make changes. My orders were cut. I'd been assigned to the Phantom Fleet
01:46:44.76 --> 01:46:50.68 Replacement Squadron at Naval Air Station, Miramar, as luck would have it there. In the bustling
01:46:50.68 --> 01:46:58.20 on-clave of Fighter Squadron, 121, I would have the chance to help solve our costly, tragic problem.
01:46:58.20 --> 01:47:09.72 So you get to Miramar. Fall 1968, Fighter Town USA. That's the longstanding nickname of the
01:47:09.72 --> 01:47:13.88 Naval Air Station, who Spanish name Miramar doesn't even seem to suit the place. There's no
01:47:13.88 --> 01:47:18.92 view of the sea from its location, 15 miles north of San Diego, five miles in from the coast,
01:47:19.56 --> 01:47:23.80 at least not until you've gone wheels up and you're flying west on that air controllers.
01:47:23.80 --> 01:47:28.76 Well, what the air controllers call a sea wolf departure. Know the unofficial nickname painted
01:47:28.76 --> 01:47:34.52 on Hangarwon is a much better fit. On the runways, ramps and taxiways of the sprawling complex,
01:47:34.52 --> 01:47:39.80 the shriek of jet engines and the smell of aviation fuel is constant. If my love of flight had
01:47:39.80 --> 01:47:44.20 been tested by war, I still never shook the habit of lifting my eyes to the sky whenever a jet
01:47:44.20 --> 01:47:49.40 roared overhead. Who was it? How was he doing? What's going on? As an instructor, it was my job
01:47:49.40 --> 01:47:54.04 to keep track of my nuggets. When I parked my sea bag at Miramar again, this time to serve as a
01:47:54.04 --> 01:48:00.20 tactics instructor at Fighter Squadron 121, I found the pace of daily life, clipping along at a
01:48:00.20 --> 01:48:05.40 fast wartime tempo. The whole West Coast Naval shore establishment had ramped up to support the
01:48:05.40 --> 01:48:12.84 war in Vietnam and VF 121 was hauling a heavy load. I was an instructor in the advanced tactics phase
01:48:12.84 --> 01:48:19.64 of the squadron. A good man, Lieutenant Commander Sam Leeds was the head of tactics.
01:48:21.24 --> 01:48:26.20 Well, again, I'm jumping through some stuff here. What kept us from pushing the aerodynamic
01:48:26.20 --> 01:48:32.20 limits? Because you talk about what you guys were doing to train and then you kind of have a caveat
01:48:32.20 --> 01:48:36.84 that you weren't pushing as hard as you wanted to. What kept us from pushing the aerodynamic limits
01:48:36.84 --> 01:48:42.20 was the risk of version that commonly afflix training. The worst thing we could do as far as our
01:48:42.20 --> 01:48:49.56 higher headquarters was concerned was lose a plane. So twice a day, I took new fanom pilots
01:48:49.56 --> 01:48:55.24 and their back seaters up to fly. We played it safe. We did air combat maneuvering or ACM,
01:48:55.24 --> 01:49:01.56 but always within strict safety parameters. As a result, the program lacked combat realism.
01:49:01.56 --> 01:49:05.32 The first time rag pilots saw the radical maneuvers that modern jets were capable of.
01:49:05.32 --> 01:49:16.84 Tracers were flying. The rise had not been opened. That's not how you want to send a young man
01:49:16.84 --> 01:49:23.000 after off to war. So you guys are training within some pretty strict confines.
01:49:24.12 --> 01:49:28.20 And it's crazy to think that the first time a guy is really going to be able to test
01:49:28.20 --> 01:49:34.76 is to maximize the maneuverability and the capability of the aircraft is going to be in combat.
01:49:35.32 --> 01:49:38.68 It's ridiculous. But doing it for five years.
01:49:41.72 --> 01:49:46.36 Luckily, not long after my arrival in late December, Sam leads call me into his office and
01:49:46.36 --> 01:49:51.40 showed me a thick document bound in a blue cover. It was a study issued by the Naval Air Systems
01:49:51.40 --> 01:49:59.16 Command. It's title, report of the air to air missile system capability review hardly sounded like a blockbuster.
01:49:59.16 --> 01:50:04.76 But this study produced by Captain Frank Alt, the captain of the coral sea, was an impressive
01:50:04.76 --> 01:50:10.28 consequential piece of work. About 200 pages long, it was a top to bottom exploration of the
01:50:10.28 --> 01:50:16.04 reasons for our failure in air to air combat over North Vietnam. Captain Alt's project had been a
01:50:16.04 --> 01:50:20.44 long time coming. It began in the summer of 1968 when he led a team that tackled the problem of
01:50:20.44 --> 01:50:26.04 the Sparrow missile. Building on that and other studies, he pulled in more than 200 people to a
01:50:26.04 --> 01:50:31.08 symposium at the Naval Air Missile Test Center at Point Magu North of Los Angeles.
01:50:31.64 --> 01:50:36.12 There were pilots, commanders, and managers, and technicians from Raytheon Westinghouse,
01:50:36.12 --> 01:50:42.04 and McDonald Douglass, all the major fighter weapons contractors, no one had put together the
01:50:42.04 --> 01:50:48.76 entire picture of the problem like Alt had. It was the first time the whole air combat system
01:50:48.76 --> 01:50:55.000 our fighters, their missiles, and fire control systems had been studied holistically from design and
01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:00.36 acquisition to operations and logistics. Alt wanted to understand weapon systems from the womb to
01:51:00.36 --> 01:51:06.36 the tomb as he liked to say. His conclusions were far reaching. Sam leads called my attention to one
01:51:06.36 --> 01:51:13.48 particular recommendation in the report. He flipped a page 37 and pointed to the 11th of the 15th
01:51:13.48 --> 01:51:20.20 items listed in paragraph 6, air crew training. It was there that Alt advised the chief of
01:51:20.20 --> 01:51:26.44 Naval Operations and the commander of Naval Air Forces, Pacific, to establish as early as possible
01:51:26.44 --> 01:51:33.48 and advance fighter weapon school at NAS Miramar for both the F8 and the F4.
01:51:34.60 --> 01:51:37.24 These were the words that gave birth to Top Gun.
01:51:37.24 --> 01:51:44.92 Sam and I knew that any Miramar based tactics training program would run through us. He looked
01:51:44.92 --> 01:51:49.32 at me and said, Dan, why don't you take it? I suppose this was generous of him. He had both
01:51:49.32 --> 01:51:54.44 experience and seniority over me. He could have led the effort himself, but he had already had a great
01:51:54.44 --> 01:51:58.60 job waiting for him. He was in the final running to command the first fighter squadron that would
01:51:58.60 --> 01:52:04.12 fly the new F14 Tomcat. Sam could have easily taken the assignment to start a new school house,
01:52:04.12 --> 01:52:09.80 to start a new school house and then he handed off to me when his time came to fly the F14s,
01:52:09.80 --> 01:52:14.68 but he felt the school should have the same leadership from the beginning for continuity sake.
01:52:14.68 --> 01:52:19.80 He said as much and strongly. It was settled then and there. I made it quick, faithful decision.
01:52:20.68 --> 01:52:28.20 I do it. And you're what? Lieutenant Commander right now? At this point? 31 years old, Lieutenant
01:52:28.20 --> 01:52:38.52 Commander, I was probably going above about 50 years old, tired, fatigue, and as a great opportunity.
01:52:38.52 --> 01:52:50.28 I mean, that is the best gift in a career somebody gave me. Frank Alt, the all report,
01:52:50.28 --> 01:52:56.36 Marvel's document, unsolicited. He did that on his own. It wasn't asked for.
01:52:56.36 --> 01:53:04.60 He told us what was wrong in detail, but he never taught. They've got blessing. He never
01:53:04.60 --> 01:53:12.28 mandated what to do about it. He just said, I want to graduate school. It's to get well program
01:53:12.84 --> 01:53:21.32 in the shortest amount of time. Somebody in endorsing him when it was approved and sent to 121.
01:53:21.32 --> 01:53:30.44 They put in two months and we don't have any space for you. We don't have a building. We don't
01:53:30.44 --> 01:53:38.60 have any airplanes. I don't have any support people, but you got two months to make the school.
01:53:39.88 --> 01:53:46.84 And teach a first class. Now this is a graduate school, Taco. This is not what we've been
01:53:46.84 --> 01:53:55.24 teaching for five years. Can you imagine the confrontation you're going to get from the existing
01:53:55.24 --> 01:54:00.60 squad and commanders? I don't know. And these are O5. The squadron commanders at this time were
01:54:00.60 --> 01:54:07.40 they O5. So you're juniored all these guys. Oh, yeah. It's beautiful. It will be all on the
01:54:07.40 --> 01:54:12.52 what that's like. Yeah. You say soon we started calling the school top gun. We weren't the first to
01:54:12.52 --> 01:54:17.000 use this nickname. There was an annual weapons competition that used the same name until about
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:22.92 1958. The aircraft carrier Ranger, which I would later command called itself the top gun in the
01:54:22.92 --> 01:54:32.20 Pacific Fleet. You can't. You can't write every day Navy fighter weapons school. You got to
01:54:32.20 --> 01:54:46.28 have a nickname and top gun just seemed to work. That's it. And they liked it. You had to, you know,
01:54:46.28 --> 01:54:52.68 you had the goal of top gun wasn't just to teach pilots, but to make those pilots kind of
01:54:52.68 --> 01:54:59.48 teach into teachers themselves. Oh, that's it. That's the answer. It's like a teachers college.
01:54:59.48 --> 01:55:06.60 In other words, you got to teach people that are going out of the fleet in the solicitation. We did
01:55:07.40 --> 01:55:16.12 in the initial solicitation to bring in students that send your two best. The two best nuggets
01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:23.96 or Lieutenant's or below from your squadron. I mean, of course, some of the some of the
01:55:23.96 --> 01:55:33.32 reaction, we don't want to put it on tape here. But the idea was those two guys who come back,
01:55:33.32 --> 01:55:43.80 we'd form a cat in about six weeks. We'd teach in graduate school and they go back out and they teach
01:55:43.80 --> 01:55:54.04 their entire school under the new tactics. So it's colorful. You uh, the lore behind this is awesome.
01:55:54.04 --> 01:56:02.84 You you go into selecting the first originally you call them. And I have to at least just kind of
01:56:02.84 --> 01:56:06.84 run through some of the highlights. The stories you got behind these guys are awesome.
01:56:06.84 --> 01:56:13.64 Uh, Mel Holmes, the first round pick by anybody's book. One time Mel was golfing at Basin,
01:56:13.64 --> 01:56:17.96 of course, in Merimar, he had a drive into the weeds. That was bad news for the nest of rattle
01:56:17.96 --> 01:56:22.20 snakes he walked into while looking for his ball. When his buddies saw him hacking away with his
01:56:22.20 --> 01:56:28.60 seven iron slaughtering those serpents in the grass, Holmes had his nickname, Wrathler. He had one
01:56:28.60 --> 01:56:35.24 trait in spades that I strongly doubt is teachable, a bone deep, hardwired electric fire sense of aggression.
01:56:35.24 --> 01:56:42.60 I chose John Smash Nash for the way his heart mined work together. Any suggestion that a
01:56:42.60 --> 01:56:47.96 mismatch was at hand triggered his compited his competitive fire. His motto, I'd rather die than
01:56:47.96 --> 01:56:55.24 lose, bore it out. Most combat pilots were our wired that way. What Matt, what made Nash special was
01:56:55.24 --> 01:57:01.24 the way he combined that fire with hyper attention to detail. Jim Rullison, as I say that right?
01:57:01.24 --> 01:57:10.04 Jim Rullison probably put out more intellectual wattage than any of us. Jerry Sootsky, or Skiebert,
01:57:10.04 --> 01:57:16.76 as I called him, had played linebacker for Bear Bryant at Alabama. We appreciated him for being as
01:57:16.76 --> 01:57:23.08 reliable as gravity. And then so there's your pilots and then without a good backseater, you get into the
01:57:23.08 --> 01:57:29.24 the reos at the head of the pack was JC Smith, who I invited right away. He might have been the
01:57:29.24 --> 01:57:36.28 finest real there ever was. You also had Jim Hawkeye, Hawkeye, Lang? Is that right?
01:57:36.28 --> 01:57:42.52 Do you mean Lang? Say new. A youngster, just 23 years old, so quiet and person you'd never know,
01:57:42.52 --> 01:57:47.48 he was a tiger in the rear seat during his two combat tours in Vietnam flying from the Kitty Hawk.
01:57:47.48 --> 01:57:55.64 He and his pilot, named, flamed a Meg 17 in a wild fight near high fong harbor. Lang survived
01:57:55.64 --> 01:58:06.44 two ejections in barely a month. I don't even know what to say about surviving two ejections in a
01:58:06.44 --> 01:58:12.68 month. That's just crazy. You'd like to mean him. It'd be a good interview. Well, he's obviously
01:58:12.68 --> 01:58:20.12 open invite whenever he wants. I'll be standing by our other Smith Steve had all the
01:58:20.12 --> 01:58:24.12 essentials of a top grade reel that stood apart from everybody for his skills as a salesman,
01:58:24.12 --> 01:58:30.52 organizer and grifter for all seasons. Our junior Rio, Lieutenant Junior Grade, Darrell Gary,
01:58:30.52 --> 01:58:34.76 was the youngest man in a cadre of founders. He had every attribute I wanted instructor,
01:58:34.76 --> 01:58:40.92 mature beyond his years, confident beneath his years and very hard working. Last find was Chuck
01:58:40.92 --> 01:58:47.48 Hilderbrand and he was an intel guy. So you brought him to help you guys with the intel side of
01:58:47.48 --> 01:58:53.80 figuring out what other aircraft consisted of what they're capable of. One to become the
01:58:54.68 --> 01:59:03.16 central repository of tactical aviation within Navy. Navy had none of them. They were classified
01:59:03.16 --> 01:59:09.88 at all. It's over CIA, CIA headquarters, up to that point. So I wanted to build it and it
01:59:10.36 --> 01:59:16.36 works that way now. And you guys basically did you basically steal a trailer for this organization?
01:59:16.36 --> 01:59:24.36 That's a great story. You love it. We're just fussing our hump to get ready in two months.
01:59:25.56 --> 01:59:34.76 There's no op order for this. There's no plan. It's winging it. Whatever, whatever is fair,
01:59:34.76 --> 01:59:41.32 just do it and get it done. The individual guys had and I've been flying with these railies
01:59:41.32 --> 01:59:48.84 often on. And I learned from this railies when you got a lot done on a tight schedule. You
01:59:48.84 --> 01:59:56.20 have to do things. Get people that are intellectually or professionally excellent in given technical
01:59:56.20 --> 02:00:08.76 areas. So these guys all have their expertise to start with. And Steve Smith, who
02:00:08.76 --> 02:00:16.76 probably should be a felon, and he's a wealthy one with that now. But at the time, you know,
02:00:16.76 --> 02:00:24.12 he gave, he'd make a list of things to do every day. And by he and I'd work together in early
02:00:24.12 --> 02:00:32.04 morning and by evening time and this got all done. Is that kind of guy? Get it done.
02:00:32.04 --> 02:00:41.40 Personal, great. And one Friday early in the morning, I said, damn, I said, we're really moving
02:00:41.40 --> 02:00:49.08 forward. Paperwork wise. Plan why? And the taxi. Really looking good. But I said, we don't even have
02:00:49.08 --> 02:01:00.20 a place to start holding formalizes thing. And I said, but I got an idea. So I sat him down
02:01:00.20 --> 02:01:07.96 behind Bay Sobs at Mermort. And he comes back on Saturday morning with a big 40 foot crank
02:01:08.52 --> 02:01:17.000 hanging below it. Is a 20 by 40 building, which is a pictures that are in the book of the original
02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:23.88 he had stolen this thing. He had brought the crane operator with a case of Scott to which I
02:01:23.88 --> 02:01:35.000 ended up buying. And they bring it down. And you know, the pace of things was such that I said,
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:41.48 you got what? And the guys were all laughing. Whole place was laughing. Go out. And here's a
02:01:41.48 --> 02:01:49.08 CEO's parking spots all along the street. And here's his crane with his big building. Suspended
02:01:49.08 --> 02:01:56.60 below it. He said, where do you want to put it? I said, you put it right here by the steps leading
02:01:56.60 --> 02:02:05.000 up to fight her down hangar, but right here right above the CEOs parking spot. One 21. And we
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:11.48 got away with it. So Sunday he says, I got a bunch of flooring. We're going to put new flooring
02:02:11.48 --> 02:02:19.64 in the building today. So everybody came in and we hammered nails and glued down new flooring in there.
02:02:20.20 --> 02:02:27.80 And he brings in red paint. And we painted the trim on the building. All red. I said,
02:02:27.80 --> 02:02:35.08 what an hell is you do it in red for? He said, who would believe you'd steal a building and paint
02:02:35.08 --> 02:02:42.84 red. This is a mentality that you're dealing with. And and by God Monday morning,
02:02:42.84 --> 02:02:51.80 income some vans that Nevada license plates. And I think he had been up to Nellus and stole
02:02:51.80 --> 02:02:59.56 a bunch of salvage furniture from the Air Force. But he brought in desks and chairs and
02:02:59.56 --> 02:03:07.48 and in safe. He got a couple of safe. This was a kind of guy. And it whipped it out three days.
02:03:09.16 --> 02:03:19.48 We started we started the classroom then. That's epic. You say here, before we could teach
02:03:19.48 --> 02:03:23.72 the material, we had to study and learn it called ourselves. We created, collated,
02:03:23.72 --> 02:03:29.32 and corrected the curriculum at a fever pace, working all hours to refine it, hunting and
02:03:29.32 --> 02:03:33.24 packing with two fingers on manual typewriters, redlining each other's drafts for hercing lectures to
02:03:33.24 --> 02:03:38.28 each other. This last part was key as we took turns on the podium and the trailer. We faced
02:03:39.72 --> 02:03:43.56 we faced withering scrutiny from our fellow instructors in the military. This is known as a
02:03:43.56 --> 02:03:50.04 murder board. No hiccup in presentation style. No slip of the tongue. No glitch in dress or personal
02:03:50.04 --> 02:03:56.20 appearance was too small to be seized upon and corrected on the spot. We knew we would be ineffective
02:03:56.20 --> 02:04:00.84 lecturing our top not students if we were anything less than bulletproof. How would they believe
02:04:00.84 --> 02:04:06.84 us at top going if we couldn't deliver graduate level lessons well? In the meantime, we began
02:04:06.84 --> 02:04:10.52 reaching out to the fleets squadrons to recruit their students. It's interesting to me. I found
02:04:10.52 --> 02:04:17.32 that part. Interesting that you guys went hyper professional. You went, hey, we are going to be
02:04:17.32 --> 02:04:22.76 over the top professional because you could see the attitude, hey, we're doing this. We're kind of
02:04:22.76 --> 02:04:27.72 flying by the seat of our pants. I will teach you kind of half-hazard. You guys went hyper professional.
02:04:27.72 --> 02:04:37.64 That was an awesome move. In the forward to the book, the Edeliments and then murder boarding
02:04:37.64 --> 02:04:46.28 has a night element. It took us a while to analyze. We we-we-wined it to get it going. But once we
02:04:46.28 --> 02:04:55.64 got it up in it with successful, we had to set the standards high because nobody believed you know,
02:04:55.64 --> 02:05:01.08 it was the same type of thing that we had been doing for five years. It wasn't going to fly.
02:05:01.96 --> 02:05:10.76 But just make it special and it's still that way. Is it not? 100%. 100% that legacy has
02:05:10.76 --> 02:05:17.000 sustained from the beginning. In the elements are in the forward to that book. No. And they're
02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:23.96 applicable to commercial enterprise. You'd be amazed who I've lectured on those. I wouldn't be
02:05:23.96 --> 02:05:31.000 as I wouldn't be surprised at all. I know the, I know that the principles that we learned in the
02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:40.04 military are extremely applicable to any leadership situation. Sorry. You're just about to start
02:05:40.04 --> 02:05:45.16 the first class. And you say this, I was cooking along in full afterburner about 100 miles off the
02:05:45.16 --> 02:05:50.76 California coast approaching San Clemente Island when I felt the thump. My warning panel lit up.
02:05:50.76 --> 02:05:56.36 There was a fire in my right engine. As I shut it down, my back seat or lieutenant J. G. G. Gill
02:05:56.36 --> 02:06:02.68 slimy ran through the emergency checklist while Mel eased in close for a visual inspection
02:06:02.68 --> 02:06:07.72 trying to see through all the smoke. We were about 30 miles from Miramar, off La Jolla,
02:06:07.72 --> 02:06:13.80 when the seven-liter liquid auction canister mounted in the tail of my phantom exploded.
02:06:14.60 --> 02:06:18.92 It tore the tail section clean off my bird and over and we tumbled,
02:06:18.92 --> 02:06:24.36 time slowed down. We plummeted. In my headset, I think I heard Mel's voice,
02:06:24.36 --> 02:06:30.68 Dan, you guys eject, eject, Gill pulled the handle and we rocketed out of the doom jet.
02:06:31.40 --> 02:06:36.04 We fell toward the ocean strapped into our ejection seats at 21,000 feet.
02:06:36.04 --> 02:06:40.76 It's odd how time passes in a crisis inspired by the flood of adrenaline into my system.
02:06:40.76 --> 02:06:45.48 I'd time to look down over La Jolla, notice the scenic curve. My helmet visor was gone,
02:06:45.48 --> 02:06:50.60 but somehow my Ray-Band sunglasses were still hanging on. I've got to save them, I thought.
02:06:50.60 --> 02:06:54.92 Those sunglasses had been with me since my Pensacola training days. No way did I want to lose them
02:06:54.92 --> 02:07:00.68 now. I reached up, shook them off my face and stuffed them into a zippered pocket on my flight suit.
02:07:00.68 --> 02:07:05.88 It was then that I realized as I fell through space that I was still attached to my ejection seat.
02:07:05.88 --> 02:07:10.68 This was a problem. The heavy apparatus was supposed to separate automatically by action of a
02:07:10.68 --> 02:07:16.84 powerful spring activated by barestad at 12,000 feet. Falling toward the sea, I looked around for
02:07:16.84 --> 02:07:23.000 Gill's shoot and was relieved to see him drifting down behind an above me. This engaged myself,
02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:28.36 disengaging myself manually from the ejection seat and falling clear, I pulled the D-Ring to pop my
02:07:28.36 --> 02:07:34.60 shoot. Nothing happened. I yanked it again harder and the cable broke off in my glove hand.
02:07:34.60 --> 02:07:38.68 I was falling at terminal velocity 14 feet per second like a rock.
02:07:39.64 --> 02:07:45.32 Somehow I had to get my hands on the shoot pack. Short on time and altitude, I pulled myself
02:07:45.32 --> 02:07:50.92 up the risers and reached my shoot pack. I thought of my wife and kids and home and it was
02:07:50.92 --> 02:07:56.28 God who gave me the strength. I'm sure reaching the parachute pack, I opened it with my hands
02:07:56.28 --> 02:08:04.12 and the shoot flew free. The beautiful white blossom swelled above me jerking me upright into a lazy
02:08:04.12 --> 02:08:13.40 but short descent. Thank you, my dear Lord. Is that your first ejection? Only. Only ejection.
02:08:14.12 --> 02:08:19.56 You had to climb up the risers of your parachute and yanked that thing out. That's very
02:08:19.56 --> 02:08:27.56 different. Okay. It was not a big deal to have a malfunctioning parachute after you ejected out
02:08:27.56 --> 02:08:33.56 of your F-4 fan and with the engine exploded. I was going to be impressed.
02:08:33.56 --> 02:08:39.96 The next line gets even better. Yeah, looking down at the cold water, I saw the dark,
02:08:39.96 --> 02:08:46.12 sleek shadows swimming just below the surface. Yeah, people don't, I mean you're off the coast
02:08:46.12 --> 02:08:53.16 of Southern California. There's sharks. There are and actually people know this now because you
02:08:53.16 --> 02:08:58.52 know we have drones flying around and now that they fly drones all over the place, people are all
02:08:58.52 --> 02:09:03.88 shocked that there's a bunch of sharks out there like I'm a surfer and people are now realizing,
02:09:03.88 --> 02:09:10.44 oh there's sharks right off the coast of where we surf and you know I said the sharks have always
02:09:10.44 --> 02:09:16.84 been there. That's their home, you know. So you can kind of visualize some sharks as you were
02:09:16.84 --> 02:09:23.40 inbound? Well, I looked down and they saw the silhouette in the dark and this was 15 minutes
02:09:23.40 --> 02:09:34.76 for dark and the water's cold, 13th of February and so I hit the water and then my little raft
02:09:34.76 --> 02:09:45.64 disinflated so I climb in this, because I can, it's cold man and I think I was motivated by the
02:09:45.64 --> 02:09:52.84 thought it was probably sharks turns out it was dolphin because where my big boots were sitting
02:09:52.84 --> 02:10:00.76 on the end of the raft, pretty soon boom, boom, two snouts turn up and these squeaky little levels
02:10:00.76 --> 02:10:07.16 were sitting there looking at me. You guys are probably swam with those people. And they're talking,
02:10:07.16 --> 02:10:14.04 they're children, they're excited to have somebody new and the world. I got rescued by heel
02:10:14.04 --> 02:10:16.76 that night. Yeah.
02:10:18.76 --> 02:10:24.68 March 3rd, 1969 in our stolen trailer at Fidertown USA Top Guns, Class One convened
02:10:24.68 --> 02:10:30.28 and I had to throw this in there. I issued a heartfelt welcome aboard and said we'd been
02:10:30.28 --> 02:10:33.40 charged with an important purpose. This is you talking to your students for the first time.
02:10:34.04 --> 02:10:38.76 I introduced my instructor team and told them who we all were. I explained that we would all
02:10:38.76 --> 02:10:44.92 learn together along the way. The main thing for any skipper to bear in mind is this. The troops
02:10:45.80 --> 02:10:51.56 know the troops need to know he's interested in their welfare. This is true regardless of the
02:10:51.56 --> 02:10:57.08 leader's personal communication style. Hard asses can care too. Some leaders give lip service to
02:10:57.08 --> 02:11:04.36 caring but what a leader does it does to show it is far more important. I wanted my instructors
02:11:04.36 --> 02:11:10.28 to challenge them but always constructively. We would aspire to build their confidence not destroy it.
02:11:10.28 --> 02:11:16.12 They were professionals and future mentors in training so we were going to show them how it was
02:11:16.12 --> 02:11:21.24 done. I close by saying there is an urgency here beyond anything we've ever done. We
02:11:21.24 --> 02:11:25.96 hold lives in our hands. These words still fill me with conviction today.
02:11:27.56 --> 02:11:33.56 So this was a like you said a graduate level school and you're treating these people more as peers
02:11:33.56 --> 02:11:39.96 than as you know people that weren't worthy of being there and that needed to bow down to you guys.
02:11:42.36 --> 02:11:48.20 None of that. There's a brotherhood in dealing and you guys know that.
02:11:48.20 --> 02:11:55.56 Dealing new in life every single day. Yours there's they knew why they were there.
02:11:56.52 --> 02:12:00.60 They were there to get better so they wouldn't go out and get themselves back.
02:12:02.76 --> 02:12:13.08 And their big because their sensibility a jaw-caught think is we made it known right from the
02:12:13.08 --> 02:12:21.16 first time they got the date they were there to become proficient teacher on score the mates
02:12:22.52 --> 02:12:28.44 and boy that stuck. They're pride. Pride and being the top gun instructor right David.
02:12:29.40 --> 02:12:32.04 It's not an easy way to get there sir.
02:12:37.32 --> 02:12:42.04 The pace of the program accelerated once we began flying a lot after the first week or so we ran
02:12:42.04 --> 02:12:46.20 two or three training sororities every day with the instructors playing the role of aggressors.
02:12:46.20 --> 02:12:50.52 We would put the students in different scenarios flying all the basic permutations.
02:12:50.52 --> 02:12:55.08 One versus one two versus one one versus two two versus two four versus two four versus four
02:12:55.08 --> 02:13:00.44 and two versus four. A dogfight is a true physical ordeal when a fighter aircraft is flown hard.
02:13:00.44 --> 02:13:05.56 It shakes you like a plummeting roller coaster on the verge of collapse. Your buffeted from side to side
02:13:05.56 --> 02:13:09.64 helmet hammering the plexiglass canopy harness digging into your shoulders and hips.
02:13:09.64 --> 02:13:14.52 GeForce is caused blood to surge and drain from your extremities including your head.
02:13:14.52 --> 02:13:17.48 Our program tested not only a student's body but his mind.
02:13:19.80 --> 02:13:24.04 Fast forward a little bit. There were a couple names for the mid-killing new tactics we developed
02:13:24.04 --> 02:13:31.32 in the F4 community. It basically involved flying a fan or fan of like a Saturn V rocket straight up.
02:13:31.32 --> 02:13:36.12 Sometimes we called it using the vertical envelope. It was also known as the high yo yo.
02:13:36.12 --> 02:13:41.56 But the name we settled on was inspired by the shape of the airspace we used while flying it.
02:13:41.56 --> 02:13:47.16 JC Smith called it the egg and the moniker stuck. That was the shape our fanom's track
02:13:47.16 --> 02:13:53.72 rocketing up and coming back down. So you guys are starting to come up with new tactics, new methods.
02:13:55.88 --> 02:14:05.56 The F4 is greatest attribute to magnificent Indians and it would go up and no
02:14:05.56 --> 02:14:13.24 makes ever stay way. We learned to fly. I'm flown zero air feet on the back up here.
02:14:13.24 --> 02:14:22.12 Just two pilot, free fighter and gauge fighter. One guy is down push in the makes.
02:14:22.12 --> 02:14:29.64 The other guy comes in and goes right to sweet spot to shoot. We got very good at it.
02:14:29.64 --> 02:14:37.48 And we flew the airplane way beyond what McDonald's was sold them for.
02:14:38.84 --> 02:14:43.48 So you're putting, are you putting this thing into a stall when you reach the apex of the
02:14:43.48 --> 02:14:46.36 vertical or you get close to it but you have to back off?
02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:51.88 She behaves, take her up to where you're comfortable and what you see down below.
02:14:51.88 --> 02:14:59.96 Sometimes you get really slow up here. Sometimes you go to zero and the airplane would behave so well.
02:14:59.96 --> 02:15:10.44 Use rotters not a lot. Aileron but rotters and I've flown the airplane straight into
02:15:10.44 --> 02:15:17.80 a piraticle to zero air speed. Full afterburner leave it there and come back down and we did it to
02:15:17.80 --> 02:15:26.20 make sure what the airplane would do in case you got up here and some nugget didn't get it over
02:15:26.92 --> 02:15:35.000 on its backside to fly straight up afterburner's going and cheat chugs and she didn't like it very
02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:39.96 much but she comes down just like this to fall through on her belly and goes out the bottom
02:15:39.96 --> 02:15:46.68 and name a McDonald's or an award. I'm going to stay with you through that and we did that and I made the
02:15:46.68 --> 02:15:55.48 guys each one of them. I went up and demoed it put a student in the back seat and made him
02:15:55.48 --> 02:16:01.24 getting a front seat and I climbed the back. No flight controls in the back seat at her point
02:16:01.80 --> 02:16:10.68 and I ride through that in the back seat and when that was over he is confidence was well.
02:16:10.68 --> 02:16:21.80 It worked great. That's a basic tag. Flung the vertical. You say flying every day we worked
02:16:21.80 --> 02:16:26.52 on all this and we worked hard we developed the egg in a way that made excellent use of our
02:16:26.52 --> 02:16:33.64 two plane loose-dose formation which basically with loose-dose talk talk us through the loose-dose
02:16:33.64 --> 02:16:42.52 formation a little bit. That's just two airplanes mutual support at the key okay. You got to be able
02:16:42.52 --> 02:16:47.72 to when you're cruising through Indian country you got to be able to keep them off your six
02:16:47.72 --> 02:16:52.92 you know when you get shot and you don't want you to get shot and from this position they can
02:16:52.92 --> 02:17:01.64 cross turn and they can clear each other or not more war to from reading and and so you get in the
02:17:01.64 --> 02:17:07.96 Indian country and you got mixed and you come through the merge maybe you're also a little bit
02:17:07.96 --> 02:17:16.20 but come through the merge and mix them down. You passed it and one of them becomes a free fighter
02:17:16.20 --> 02:17:22.36 he goes into vertical the other one comes around try and push and mix and you're trying to push
02:17:22.36 --> 02:17:29.40 them into predictability. Make drivers are like everybody they want to stay alive and some
02:17:29.40 --> 02:17:36.76 mummar very a degrees of expertise some mummar too good some mummar excellent you know the
02:17:36.76 --> 02:17:44.28 top-maked driver in Norvian I'm got nine nine vectors and serious business so any free fighter
02:17:44.28 --> 02:17:53.000 this guy up here would always try and come down it's a I'm in two's off or you know that's where we
02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:58.60 that's how we ended up with the call signs so we have because you can't can't relate numbers
02:17:59.32 --> 02:18:09.08 to each other you got to have a you know rivals in thanks off right when when the second aircraft
02:18:09.08 --> 02:18:13.48 goes starts to go up when the first aircraft comes down is in is the other one now taking the
02:18:13.48 --> 02:18:19.48 opposition yeah yeah it's keep track of the makes makes remember don't have the power to get
02:18:19.48 --> 02:18:25.72 up with the family and that they're in a lot of strength yeah so you keep pushing down there don't let
02:18:25.72 --> 02:18:32.92 them get fast just push them down and eventually one of you one potato two potatoes one of
02:18:32.92 --> 02:18:39.88 you will get a valid shot by the side one and oh god if I ever wanted anything in my flying
02:18:39.88 --> 02:18:49.88 bird I wanted a gun and a family never had a gun I know I could have won every fight with a gun
02:18:50.68 --> 02:18:58.20 gadlin gun this this concept of of the loose-dose formation you know even when you said mutually
02:18:58.20 --> 02:19:04.76 supporting you know in in ground tactics right we have the principle of cover move which means
02:19:04.76 --> 02:19:09.40 we're gonna work together when one person's moving the other person's shooting or you know
02:19:09.40 --> 02:19:13.08 keep in the enemy distracted yeah the allows the other person move to a better position a
02:19:13.08 --> 02:19:17.24 superior position you and they're gonna follow up the other interesting thing you said about how you
02:19:17.24 --> 02:19:25.32 could use ones and twos uh my first deployment to Iraq you know we had the humvies were numbered
02:19:25.32 --> 02:19:30.76 one two three four five six so you go out on target and everyone's assigned what vehicle you're
02:19:30.76 --> 02:19:36.76 gonna get into one two three four five six well because of the arranged so you go assault the target
02:19:36.76 --> 02:19:44.20 and the the vehicles would rearrange to so when you got back in and we could leave immediately
02:19:44.20 --> 02:19:48.92 well they wouldn't always rearrange in the right order and so what you'd end up with a guy that
02:19:48.92 --> 02:19:53.000 came in vehicle to he'd come out of an assault he'd look and he'd see vehicle number two and he'd
02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:56.36 go jump in it because he thought it was you know he'd count down the others number one there's
02:19:56.36 --> 02:20:00.92 number two I came in vehicle two well that that wasn't accurate and you'd have guys going to the
02:20:00.92 --> 02:20:06.04 wrong vehicles and so we ended up I said we're gonna name the vehicles and you're gonna know what
02:20:06.04 --> 02:20:11.96 vehicle you're in by name because that way hey if I came in big earn or whatever you know
02:20:11.96 --> 02:20:15.48 bigger and was the humvie I came in cool I get out I said I'm looking I'm not looking for a number I'm
02:20:15.48 --> 02:20:20.44 looking for big earn and that way my team is gonna be together we can get a quick head count same same
02:20:20.44 --> 02:20:28.60 idea yeah loose doose is that what you guys did two days it's almost exactly the same I mean
02:20:28.60 --> 02:20:32.76 the terminology is the same all the things he's talking about everything that that they are talking
02:20:32.76 --> 02:20:38.12 about has to stay into this day almost the exact same approach only anything changes is the
02:20:38.12 --> 02:20:44.36 opposition zero points your own airplane the weapon system that they're giving you to fly
02:20:45.56 --> 02:20:54.28 and that's therein lies the complexity of being a top-gun instructor because it's a constant
02:20:54.28 --> 02:21:02.68 dynamic they have got to work to stay ahead of the potential enemies if it'd be China if it'd be
02:21:02.68 --> 02:21:11.64 Russia everybody in the free world is working to keep their intelligence and their tactics
02:21:13.80 --> 02:21:24.20 revised if you will it's a full-time dynamic business hard work you say this about the loose
02:21:24.20 --> 02:21:30.52 doose the loose doose tactic reflected top-guns culture and this is why I called this out
02:21:30.52 --> 02:21:35.40 because it's not just the tactic that you use in the air which empowered junior officers to act
02:21:35.40 --> 02:21:40.36 and speak freely there was no leader wingman hierarchy in our tactics which left either fighter
02:21:40.36 --> 02:21:46.12 free to attack depending on who stage or depending on who cited a bogey first loose doose was
02:21:46.12 --> 02:21:51.56 a versatile and aggressive certainly was a far cry from the air force's tactic the fluid for which
02:21:51.56 --> 02:21:59.000 in spite of its adjective was quite rigid giving the initiative and most opportunities to the flight
02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:08.12 leaders life at top-gun was flight club every day as the instructors flew against the students it
02:22:08.12 --> 02:22:13.56 was natural for the students to want to take a scalp now and then if one of them beat Wrathler,
02:22:13.56 --> 02:22:20.92 Smash, Swatsky, Cobra, or me it could help his service reputation they seldom did it but by the end
02:22:20.92 --> 02:22:27.16 of the syllabus and its 26 flights it did happen there was plenty of pride to be taken in that
02:22:27.16 --> 02:22:32.68 I tried to keep them grounded everybody gets beaten now and then I told them if you managed to beat
02:22:32.68 --> 02:22:40.04 Mel and were smart you understood it was dangerous to pump your ego the lesson there was that if
02:22:40.04 --> 02:22:47.08 Mel could get beat anyone could I consider this attitude the heart of professionalism
02:22:47.08 --> 02:22:52.52 and why and as for my instructors from time to time I had to warn them no ego's fellow we're
02:22:52.52 --> 02:22:59.56 fellas we're here to teach that lesson right there of when you beat the best guy and you go yeah
02:22:59.56 --> 02:23:07.24 I just beat the best guy what the real lesson is you can get beat to that's a powerful thing to think about
02:23:07.80 --> 02:23:15.96 that's turning your ego right on its head but yeah you got a train to take on the best there is
02:23:15.96 --> 02:23:24.28 every time your your whole goal in training is to beat the very best if he comes comes out someday
02:23:25.48 --> 02:23:30.20 better be ready yeah when I was in charge of training seals for deployment
02:23:30.68 --> 02:23:34.76 the people that they fought against in training for deployment was other seals
02:23:35.40 --> 02:23:39.56 that knew their tactics that had the same conditioning that had the same weapons that
02:23:39.56 --> 02:23:46.84 actually knew what their plan was they they there's no one that would ever face a tougher enemy
02:23:47.56 --> 02:23:52.12 then you're gonna face going through seal pre pre pre deployment training the tougher on
02:23:52.12 --> 02:23:59.80 enemy does not exist that's really interesting it's the same exact attitude that you guys had you know
02:23:59.80 --> 02:24:05.88 and I I talked to Dave on the phone yesterday said this is the exact same attitude that we had in
02:24:05.88 --> 02:24:11.72 the seal teams is how do we push ourselves against the hardest possible situation we can be in
02:24:11.72 --> 02:24:17.16 so when we go in a combat it seems easy that's our goal make combat seem easy yeah
02:24:18.76 --> 02:24:25.40 well you can't lead you can't lead in good concepts if you don't train that way absolutely
02:24:25.40 --> 02:24:34.12 you can't be the leader no um there's a the next section you start talking about you kind of
02:24:34.12 --> 02:24:42.20 mentioned it earlier was was paradise ranch groomlake dreamland all the same names for
02:24:42.20 --> 02:24:50.52 something that probably most people have heard the name area 51 and out there will you
02:24:50.52 --> 02:24:55.64 talked about it you can you fly out there and these guys had a couple captured
02:24:55.64 --> 02:25:03.08 meaks my first one others a lot of things going on out there and we won't go into it but I went out
02:25:03.08 --> 02:25:09.16 there and flew I went out flew a couple tests I flew five six times I flew the meaks
02:25:10.04 --> 02:25:17.40 because I wanted the experience male homes and I did that and that was the first trip out and then
02:25:17.40 --> 02:25:27.16 later on when the first class graduated I surprised them I briefed the mission and we
02:25:27.16 --> 02:25:36.04 put them in I think I led and probably male led and we took them to dreamland unknown
02:25:37.32 --> 02:25:43.24 and we go smoking in the dreamland a nice easy 500 knots in the dreamland
02:25:43.24 --> 02:25:51.56 when ever where we go and what are we going to do you know a radio silence right here comes
02:25:51.56 --> 02:25:59.16 some makes the guys got to fight the makes for a graduation present and unknown
02:26:00.20 --> 02:26:07.40 and it's surprised to hell a lot of that is and you know they did they really got it all
02:26:07.40 --> 02:26:14.60 and they were good and they flew the tactics we had taught them and they held their own
02:26:16.36 --> 02:26:25.96 and then what a party we had a mirror my life yeah that's that's completely epic
02:26:26.68 --> 02:26:31.000 I didn't catch that right didn't recall it right yeah I probably didn't catch that the first time
02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:35.24 you did that they was surprised to them and they're just looking all the way positively
02:26:35.24 --> 02:26:40.76 I did it by a mic I just read coming those days and said you get we're going we get
02:26:40.76 --> 02:26:49.000 off in section section take off and I had three up with me I think I said just just follow me
02:26:49.72 --> 02:26:55.88 and I said be ready we go need knee and country that's all I told them and so they've speculated
02:26:55.88 --> 02:27:00.92 all the way out there speculated one they away what's the crazy man doing now
02:27:00.92 --> 02:27:11.88 so it was fun we get into this and there's a lot of connections here top gun couldn't
02:27:11.88 --> 02:27:16.68 avoid a rival with the US Air Force there wasn't about politics to us it was about flying
02:27:16.68 --> 02:27:21.16 and ideas sure it bothered us to hear the Air Force claim it had created the first
02:27:21.16 --> 02:27:28.20 fighter weapon school it's bad ideas that lose wars and get people killed the most vocal
02:27:28.20 --> 02:27:33.80 advocate of the Air Force thinking at that time was major John Boyd in 1969 he was making a lot of
02:27:33.80 --> 02:27:39.80 speeches promoting his energy maneuverability theory of air to air warfare simply put it's a
02:27:39.80 --> 02:27:45.000 mathematical formula that tries to reduce fighter aircraft performance to a single value based on
02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:53.08 the plane speed thrust aerodynamic drag and weight first put forward in 1964 it had reportedly been
02:27:53.08 --> 02:27:59.88 used by the Air Force to design new fighters such as the F-15 Eagle and the F-16 fighting Falcon
02:27:59.88 --> 02:28:07.24 outstanding planes as we all know in 1969 Mel and Skye gave a talk at Tindle Air Force base in
02:28:07.24 --> 02:28:13.88 Florida John Boyd followed them pitching his theory there was some good debate and Mel remembers
02:28:13.88 --> 02:28:20.76 Air Force officers starting to challenge their catacysm in the Q&A major Boyd made an infamous
02:28:20.76 --> 02:28:28.36 remark he said that no US pilot should ever dogfight a MIG because his theory proved mathematically
02:28:28.36 --> 02:28:34.04 that since the enemy plane performed better throughout the flight envelope than the F-4 taking on
02:28:34.04 --> 02:28:40.12 a MIG was a good way to end up hanging from a parachute or a whole lot worse the problem with any
02:28:40.12 --> 02:28:46.52 theory is the baggage of its assumptions we thought major Boyd was making some rather large ones
02:28:46.52 --> 02:28:53.40 and considered his analysis suspect as a result in the base auditorium Tindle at Tindle that day
02:28:53.40 --> 02:28:59.80 Skye poked Mel in the ribs why don't you say something rattleer Mel stood up and proposed to the
02:28:59.80 --> 02:29:07.32 Air Force officer that he was underrating a few things namely people Mel said that while weapons
02:29:07.32 --> 02:29:15.000 might have parameters and airplanes theoretical values no algorithm could predict much if it excluded
02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:22.28 the most important factor of all the skill, heart and drive of the pilot in the cockpit.
02:29:23.24 --> 02:29:29.40 The moment of truth was the merge it was then that you had your chance to take the measure of a man.
02:29:30.44 --> 02:29:36.76 Sir Mel said I just don't think you know anything you can know anything about another pilot before
02:29:36.76 --> 02:29:42.84 the first turn and if you don't know that then you can't say that a MIG 17 will win every time
02:29:42.84 --> 02:29:50.28 that needed saying the best I can recall major Boyd didn't really engage you replied by restating
02:29:50.28 --> 02:29:56.28 his claim thank you for that view lieutenant but you can't fight a MIG in an F4 will lose wars that way
02:29:57.32 --> 02:30:02.84 we would see about that John Boyd was an intelligent patriotic and good at a great many things
02:30:02.84 --> 02:30:09.24 from this exchange we concluded that one of them was deriving big ideas that aspired to university
02:30:09.24 --> 02:30:15.64 but did not reckon with the human heart an aerial combat technical factors were important
02:30:16.20 --> 02:30:22.60 some of them could be modeled but no model could tell the whole story major Boyd was not wrong his
02:30:22.60 --> 02:30:29.08 theory was simply incomplete he also completely misjudged the F4 there were no slouches at science
02:30:29.08 --> 02:30:37.32 either we were no slouches at science either with cobra ruffleson's technical acuity and hard work
02:30:37.32 --> 02:30:44.36 we had fused hard data with equally hard experience it ended up showing exactly how a
02:30:44.36 --> 02:30:51.000 fandom could smoke a MIG almost every time the energy maneuverability theory had little to say about
02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:56.36 tactics or the people who made them work the pilot is a key part of the equation though it as a
02:30:56.36 --> 02:31:01.72 though as a variable it cannot be quantified out of mirror maras students and instructors bent the
02:31:01.72 --> 02:31:06.36 jet and flew beyond the limits we were trying to turn the man in the cockpit into a weapon
02:31:06.36 --> 02:31:12.36 as adversary pilots melski co-branash and i were enjoying the role flying debriefing the
02:31:12.36 --> 02:31:17.48 adjusting from the enemy point of view day after day flight after flight we were helping our
02:31:17.48 --> 02:31:26.36 students meet the challenge we were making them part of the equation and i got to say one last
02:31:26.36 --> 02:31:31.72 thing adherence to strict rules and restrictions meant almost certain defeat against well-trained
02:31:31.72 --> 02:31:39.32 pilots fighting under no such restrictions and this is why we at top gun never existed before we
02:31:39.32 --> 02:31:45.08 we at top gun we say top gun never existed before the navy set it up at Miramar no schoolhouse that
02:31:45.08 --> 02:31:51.88 required adherence to fixed ideas reduced airplanes to numbers or considered its instructors as
02:31:51.88 --> 02:31:59.56 priests could ever be top gun in our book from the final tallies over in Vietnam we would eventually
02:31:59.56 --> 02:32:10.04 learn to tell the tale you know what we ended up from the day top gun it started in the first class
02:32:10.04 --> 02:32:20.44 graduated to the end of the Vietnam war kill ratio went from 2 to 1 to 24 to 1 it works
02:32:20.44 --> 02:32:30.76 since the key elements you age is no criteria for knowledge the young ones are as good
02:32:31.72 --> 02:32:38.36 if not better because the energy level 8 possess if they're willing to study and learn
02:32:38.36 --> 02:32:45.000 the young ones are the reason you know i look at this youngster here it's hard to believe you've been
02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:56.68 that that route but and look as young as you do but we broke with tradition the only reason
02:32:56.68 --> 02:33:04.52 he Air Force until after top gun got up and going they had Air Force fighter weapons school
02:33:04.52 --> 02:33:13.48 it knows for years gunnery and a few things but never in any like top gun now they have a red flag
02:33:13.48 --> 02:33:21.40 and the reason was the three star that they had run and things during Vietnam retired
02:33:22.52 --> 02:33:32.60 one guy held them back he mandated the flying wings thing spent time with robin holes
02:33:32.60 --> 02:33:41.56 you know the great general there's a guy i is a guy i lies talked to the links with robin holes
02:33:41.56 --> 02:33:48.84 and football games with them and and brought him down to fly with a smear mark on the Friday
02:33:49.48 --> 02:33:57.64 had a super happy hour that night with him and and uh and uh i watch his career in
02:33:58.44 --> 02:34:07.16 because of the mandated things the Air Force wouldn't change we never criticized them we didn't do anything
02:34:07.16 --> 02:34:15.000 they had a well i learned a lot about them at the dream land when we were flying a dream
02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:20.60 land with the Air Force guys there were four or five guys up there we've good it's anybody i
02:34:20.60 --> 02:34:29.08 had but they were under the restriction of of an old timer old timer probably out of Washington
02:34:29.08 --> 02:34:37.56 who would come out and when he retired the Air Force jumped on red flag and they are good now let me
02:34:37.56 --> 02:34:46.52 tie it there is good as anybody so you know as you were just kind of alluding to we get into
02:34:47.16 --> 02:34:57.88 what you title in the book proof of concept which is the guys are going to war and uh you you say
02:34:57.88 --> 02:35:04.84 here top gun students became crisp smart quick deadly and confident they knew the performance
02:35:04.84 --> 02:35:08.68 envelopes of their airplanes and missiles maneuver quickly to exploit them and handled
02:35:09.40 --> 02:35:14.76 all the switch interfaces in the cockpit efficiently they demonstrated their ability to fly the
02:35:14.76 --> 02:35:22.44 egg tactics to perfection and use the high yo yo out of a two plane loose douce formation
02:35:22.44 --> 02:35:28.52 to fill a and fry a grass or pilots almost every time out their final exam was a special
02:35:28.52 --> 02:35:35.16 retreat and unrestricted sparrow inside wind or shoot against live maneuvering targets
02:35:37.24 --> 02:35:44.20 that was Steve Smith we took him up to the civic missile range and took a BQM 34
02:35:45.48 --> 02:35:51.08 which you know the good old American way would straighten leveled like shooting down an airline
02:35:51.08 --> 02:35:59.72 or and we found out that this damn BQM would out gee the airplanes particularly when it's
02:35:59.72 --> 02:36:07.64 controlled on the ground so I put Steve Smith one of my originals put him down on the ground
02:36:07.64 --> 02:36:15.08 controlling and that damn missile come out and then dogfight him and Jerry Boo yeah the first
02:36:15.08 --> 02:36:25.80 first student grad shot it down first time out give us a little history on the patch the top gun patch
02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:37.64 I don't you know we we could take every night before and after we started working students
02:36:37.64 --> 02:36:45.72 at the club we just go and sometimes have beer to and I could take today's effort so the
02:36:47.08 --> 02:36:56.84 the the patch was designed at the old club by two of the guys Steve Smith could do anything
02:36:56.84 --> 02:37:04.68 I mean these guys are we should see where they are today in business but Steve and in millholzed
02:37:04.68 --> 02:37:15.96 signed a patch and we submitted it incidentally I never asked for permission ever in a front end
02:37:15.96 --> 02:37:24.68 of what we were doing no permission no letters of approval everything you know if we if they don't
02:37:24.68 --> 02:37:33.80 like the telltale's never had to get anything ask above me and it was it wasn't me it was nine of us
02:37:35.24 --> 02:37:40.84 the key elements what I talked about each guy bringing something special table there would not
02:37:41.48 --> 02:37:49.16 she didn't like this but I do there would not have been a top gun had any of the nine guys not
02:37:49.16 --> 02:37:56.20 been available now maybe I don't know what you what your religion is or what you believe
02:37:57.48 --> 02:38:05.48 but millon I and a few of the guys sit down to our day and realize this and how we all got it together
02:38:05.48 --> 02:38:13.48 how all nine of us ended up in a group pretty much has to do with some higher power help yeah
02:38:13.48 --> 02:38:20.28 higher rank in and it worked and being young you know you could always say me a couple of
02:38:20.28 --> 02:38:30.28 then I don't know that he did nobody ever got us go ahead yeah that's that's uh and that the fact
02:38:30.28 --> 02:38:38.36 that the top gun patches are made in the sights yeah it's sort of kind of offensive right to
02:38:38.36 --> 02:38:44.68 if you're if you're a fifth year a Russian and it was and to make 21 and some many
02:38:44.68 --> 02:38:51.32 Washington said when we submitted it the guys were wearing her on the fleets Steve had a
02:38:51.32 --> 02:38:58.68 maid somewhere in the PI and made him for us quick so we're all wearing these patches you know
02:38:58.68 --> 02:39:06.68 top gun man mood like that and some many Washington called out and said we're gonna have a
02:39:06.68 --> 02:39:15.64 sponsored state department and I called my I call my bulletproof jacket who's a three star
02:39:15.64 --> 02:39:23.56 animal at airpack bush brungle nice and move bush brungle and when I took the job
02:39:23.56 --> 02:39:28.84 this is kind of off the record I took the job I talked to him because I'd work for him and
02:39:28.84 --> 02:39:37.48 I liked him and he liked me and I just said kind of man you talk about loading the thing up in
02:39:37.48 --> 02:39:46.68 the hurry and he said I'll make it bulletproof at a great career I got promoted commander early
02:39:46.68 --> 02:39:54.68 made captain two years early and you know I would end up in shit you know the only reason
02:39:54.68 --> 02:40:04.04 I'd get torpedoed along the way was bringle bringle was tough boy general quiet all man
02:40:04.04 --> 02:40:12.20 but night he predicted me in the patch he made one phone call and oh we like our patch
02:40:13.88 --> 02:40:18.28 so there's your answer you know one thing I want to jump through real quick as you mentioned
02:40:18.28 --> 02:40:26.12 a couple times the the fault the traits that you guys were you know putting forward as what a good
02:40:26.12 --> 02:40:32.44 pilot consists of you say a passion for the mission necessary to sustain the individual in
02:40:32.44 --> 02:40:38.12 an extreme environment leadership by personal example a compassionate inspirational person
02:40:38.12 --> 02:40:45.56 willing to take responsibility extraordinary airmanship required to operate in so unforgiving
02:40:45.56 --> 02:40:51.96 and environment humility derived from a sense of being part of something much greater than one
02:40:51.96 --> 02:41:00.28 self subject matter expertise that is beyond reproach a work ethic that will drive the person to do
02:41:00.28 --> 02:41:08.68 whatever it takes for however long it takes to ensure success personal discipline to endure
02:41:08.68 --> 02:41:14.20 the rigorous training and attention to detail required to constantly perform at an optimum level
02:41:14.20 --> 02:41:20.44 integrity adaptability innovation and a willingness to challenge the status quo
02:41:21.96 --> 02:41:28.20 and last credibility established through demonstrated performance sustained over time
02:41:29.96 --> 02:41:35.40 now the only thing I don't like about those is it took me I think four or five books that I've written
02:41:35.40 --> 02:41:41.16 that are thousands of words each to to explain what you just did a few it a few sentences it took
02:41:41.16 --> 02:41:50.92 me it took me three years with the help of two other guys to define and we were we were
02:41:53.96 --> 02:42:02.44 in a long time ago those were written we never put them in a legacy book document like this
02:42:02.44 --> 02:42:09.000 for the 15th anniversary but it took a three years to find and the reason being is top gun
02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:18.04 with so successful after the first half dozen classes we weren't going to get torpedoed anywhere
02:42:18.04 --> 02:42:25.72 there were guys begging to get in and we had to have selection criteria and you got one of them
02:42:26.52 --> 02:42:34.84 and they still use those criteria in the selection and the instructors I'm not sure the guys
02:42:34.84 --> 02:42:41.56 know what they're getting into because the work load is crazy how hard they were from now
02:42:43.16 --> 02:42:47.80 well obviously it's a high standard and there's a reason for it like you said earlier
02:42:47.80 --> 02:42:56.12 you got people's lives in your hands that's right and you're right and besides that right now
02:42:56.12 --> 02:43:05.48 and I don't know how you feel David but they're still even in the beginning they were the best
02:43:05.48 --> 02:43:14.92 the best and they kept that alive for 50 years that's why the book was written it's celebrating
02:43:14.92 --> 02:43:25.08 the legacy and putting it running and then like this 50 years of trying to live by those criteria
02:43:25.08 --> 02:43:30.12 in a selection because like this and it's worked and they're proud of it
02:43:31.48 --> 02:43:43.96 42 CEOs and about 600 instructors small group and at time 50 years go ahead please
02:43:47.48 --> 02:43:53.64 again this we're getting into a section now that's that's talking about the proof of concept
02:43:53.64 --> 02:43:59.48 because now the guys are at war as I was saying and we get to here on Saturday March 28th
02:43:59.48 --> 02:44:06.12 Jerry and his Rios Steve Barkley were idling their F4J standing on the catapult in a
02:44:06.12 --> 02:44:11.32 alert five status ready for quick launch when the radar control ship reported four bandits
02:44:11.32 --> 02:44:16.92 inbound toward the carrier that afternoon bollier and his air wing commander Paul Spear were launched
02:44:16.92 --> 02:44:22.28 off the constellations deck as the radar calls kept coming and the range closed they saw no
02:44:22.28 --> 02:44:27.40 sign of the mix the fanom pair pressed ahead it was bullier who first sighted the enemy fighters
02:44:27.40 --> 02:44:34.84 ahead and above him at about 25,000 feet following the loose doos doctrine Jerry alerted spear
02:44:34.84 --> 02:44:41.96 and took lead stoking his afterburners and accelerating into a climbing turn to intercept the two
02:44:41.96 --> 02:44:46.76 mixed spotted the Americans and separated the leader climbing and his wingman Blake breaking into a
02:44:46.76 --> 02:44:54.12 right turn bollier took the enemy wingman while Spear went after the leader as he closed with the
02:44:54.12 --> 02:45:00.12 number two mid bollier realized I suspect in the space of those first 20 seconds that his excitement
02:45:00.12 --> 02:45:04.92 had led him to stray from the proper technique he was fighting in the horizontal and climbing
02:45:04.92 --> 02:45:10.04 to engage his enemy directly he had lost too much airspeed to attack effectively he dove again
02:45:10.04 --> 02:45:15.88 to regain it pulling seven gs at the bottom he found the mid descending with him looking to avoid
02:45:15.88 --> 02:45:21.16 a turning fight he returned to what we had taught him he pulled up sharply sharply to initiate
02:45:21.16 --> 02:45:27.80 the egg maneuver rocketing vertically the mig had no chance to keep up meanwhile down below
02:45:27.80 --> 02:45:34.76 commander Spear had seemed to unnerve his own mig its pilot turned wide and left the fight
02:45:34.76 --> 02:45:41.88 Spear was turning back toward bollier to clear Jerry's tail when Jerry when Jerry's mig saw Spear
02:45:41.88 --> 02:45:48.04 the north Vietnamese pilot fired a heat seeking a toll missile at the approaching phantom
02:45:48.44 --> 02:45:53.64 the head shot the head on shot missed up and up bulliers phantom went with real
02:45:53.64 --> 02:45:58.68 barcly keeping him oriented telling him that the mig shooting at Spear was no threat Jerry
02:45:58.68 --> 02:46:03.48 focused on setting up his shot arcing over the top he saw that their opponent was vulnerable
02:46:03.48 --> 02:46:08.84 the mig had lost sight of him the enemy pilot banked right and then reversed sharply left
02:46:08.84 --> 02:46:15.32 as if looking for his pursuer this last maneuver was a fatal mistake it gave Jerry a clean shot
02:46:15.32 --> 02:46:21.64 up the enemy's tailpipe with the tone of a sidewinder lock buzzing in his helmet earphones
02:46:21.64 --> 02:46:27.24 he pressed the trigger and his missile left the rail it tracked true and exploded underneath the
02:46:27.24 --> 02:46:34.04 mig a shower of steel fragments sliced into the enemy plane and set it on fire trailing flames
02:46:34.04 --> 02:46:40.44 like a torch the mig sailed along rocking its wings bollier pulled up sharply to avoid running
02:46:40.44 --> 02:46:46.04 past him slid in behind him again and fired another missile this one finished him just like he had
02:46:46.04 --> 02:46:52.20 done in the drone shoot at top gun back on the deck of the constellation the celebration started
02:46:52.20 --> 02:46:59.16 immediately Paul Spear a large man gave diminutive Jerry a bear hug and lifted him off the top
02:46:59.16 --> 02:47:05.56 of his feet champagne strictly forbidden floed later that day a hanoi radio broadcast from the
02:47:05.56 --> 02:47:11.88 mig locked uh confirmed the mig loss in Washington the politics of peace talks forced the
02:47:11.88 --> 02:47:17.000 Pentagon to make smoke other than a brief announcement of a mig being downed the kill was said to have
02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:22.68 been scored by fanombs that were escorting a photo reconnaissance aircraft the navy kept a lid
02:47:22.68 --> 02:47:28.60 on the story back at Miramar we wondered who the mig killer was when it was finally confirmed that
02:47:28.60 --> 02:47:34.84 the mig killers were bowlier and barcly we were ecstatic it validated not only what we talk
02:47:35.48 --> 02:47:46.92 what not only what we taught but our schools very existence pretty awesome did you guys
02:47:46.92 --> 02:47:59.40 have any beverages when you found out that oh yeah yeah there's a lot of work getting to that
02:47:59.40 --> 02:48:07.80 point and there are a lot of people you have no idea juggle what the opposition was like but it was
02:48:07.80 --> 02:48:16.44 the same we're young we're doing the best we can that's waiting to see and man when the when the kill
02:48:16.44 --> 02:48:26.12 started happening the word started we went from having to work hard to get people to come to the
02:48:26.12 --> 02:48:38.68 school like we did before we initiated to where Steve Smith had loved same guys he'd say I'm sorry
02:48:38.68 --> 02:48:45.08 were full up for six months but I'll put you in the waiting list for next year he's ghost
02:48:47.08 --> 02:48:53.80 he's ghost guys you know they're too close to Washington they gave us a fit in the beginning
02:48:53.80 --> 02:49:01.80 fast forward in January 1972 captain Smith cut the order top gun became a permanent
02:49:01.80 --> 02:49:07.40 detachment appearing in the rag organizational chart with a solid line instead of a dotted line
02:49:07.40 --> 02:49:12.84 connecting it to chicksmith's headquarters that little tweak to the org chart made all the
02:49:12.84 --> 02:49:17.72 different suddenly we were assured of adequate staffing equipment fuel and operating funds
02:49:17.72 --> 02:49:29.48 our program is free of its former parent organization and then it goes top gun goes to war
02:49:31.64 --> 02:49:38.12 yanky station 1972 on March 30th 30,000 north Vietnamese army soldiers supported by a hundred tanks
02:49:38.12 --> 02:49:43.88 acquired from red china invaded south Vietnam a few days later another 20,000 troops also supported
02:49:43.88 --> 02:49:49.64 by tanks struck south Vietnam from louse they were the vanguard of a communist army that would
02:49:49.64 --> 02:49:55.32 ultimately field 300,000 troops and 600 armored vehicles on May 10th
02:49:56.60 --> 02:50:01.80 present Nixon ordered the mining of high fong harbor and other Japanese or another north Vietnamese
02:50:01.80 --> 02:50:07.80 ports putting a stop to Soviet deliveries of migs and surface to air missiles meanwhile air force
02:50:07.80 --> 02:50:12.76 Marine Corps navy planes hammered north Vietnamese supply lines bridges collapsed under a
02:50:12.76 --> 02:50:17.88 barrage of first generation smart weapons including laser guided bombs delivered by navy
02:50:17.88 --> 02:50:25.40 grum and a six intruders in a seven course air twos air force b 52 strato forces strato fortresses
02:50:25.40 --> 02:50:30.12 struck mega airfields around hanoi the enemy tried to defend these important targets
02:50:30.12 --> 02:50:35.40 flying make 21 and make 19 interceptors the north Vietnamese pilots found themselves in wild
02:50:35.40 --> 02:50:41.72 dog fights with US air force fanom's on May 10th 3,000,000,000,000 went down to air to air missiles
02:50:41.72 --> 02:50:48.12 but the north Vietnamese pilots scored two kills the air force continued to use old style
02:50:48.12 --> 02:50:54.84 world war two air tactics that we found so limiting the navy was on a different path
02:50:54.84 --> 02:51:00.44 the north Vietnamese makes encountered a new navy the alpha strikes included electronic countermeasure
02:51:00.44 --> 02:51:06.84 aircraft that jam the radio frequencies of the north Vietnamese pilots they ran into top gun trained
02:51:06.84 --> 02:51:17.08 pilots the tactics we developed at Miramar changed the game altogether and look this there's a
02:51:17.08 --> 02:51:21.40 section of the book that i'm not going to read right now because people just need to get the
02:51:21.40 --> 02:51:26.60 book and read it but you go into some of these incredible dog fights the tactics are being used
02:51:26.60 --> 02:51:35.24 they're being executed and victory after victory is being chalked up and you get to hear by mid-June
02:51:35.24 --> 02:51:42.92 the navy's kill ratio during linebacker stood at almost 12 to one a 600% increase over what
02:51:42.92 --> 02:51:47.64 we had managed during rolling thunder the navy's high command was ecstatic the north Vietnamese
02:51:47.64 --> 02:51:53.72 air force was clearly demoralized that spring a make 17 pilot encountered a navy f4 and ejected
02:51:53.72 --> 02:51:59.64 on the spot before he even came under fire they had no answer for our new tactics and teamwork
02:51:59.64 --> 02:52:06.28 by the summer of 1972 the migs focused on attacking the air force while avoiding U.S. flights
02:52:06.28 --> 02:52:11.80 originating from Yankee station are mig hungry top gun grads didn't like it but the tactical
02:52:11.80 --> 02:52:17.56 switch provided stark testimony to which service they thought they could score against sadly the
02:52:17.56 --> 02:52:24.44 air force fought the 1972 air campaign essentially as it had rolling thunder and here in
02:52:24.44 --> 02:52:31.48 into the fluid for formation cost them air crews of the 51 aircraft that the air force lost during
02:52:31.48 --> 02:52:38.12 operation linebacker 22 went down to guns and missiles of north Vietnamese migs during the same time
02:52:38.12 --> 02:52:44.68 the navy lost just four birds to migs the Marines lost an f4 phantom to a mig and scored one in return
02:52:45.72 --> 02:52:50.44 from the start date of the top gun program to the end of the war the navy's overall kill ratio
02:52:50.44 --> 02:53:05.40 was 24 to 1 i mean that's just transformational transformational efforts on your part the rest
02:53:05.40 --> 02:53:12.20 of the top gun team the navy captain all for putting that report together the chain of command
02:53:12.20 --> 02:53:21.72 for actually listening and enacting these things it's a incredible history it was a good start
02:53:21.72 --> 02:53:32.44 and the big thing is the book represents 50 years we wanted in writing never been written before
02:53:32.44 --> 02:53:41.64 wanted in writing the legacy of how it got started and where really it's powerful it's a
02:53:41.64 --> 02:53:53.40 problem or other volumes that could be written from this goes out into the 70s 85 probably the last
02:53:54.44 --> 02:54:05.16 in this book you guys digs red butter all these guys over 50 years they were in the
02:54:05.16 --> 02:54:15.32 they were in the opposition and they fought their way through it we gave all their planes
02:54:15.32 --> 02:54:21.88 amongst mcun who was the co number four and it up giving me his rallies all they have a
02:54:21.88 --> 02:54:29.40 carrier plates during one of their when their fiasco's over in his room all their planes were
02:54:29.40 --> 02:54:37.16 given away and they they stole some newer plates he cut their hands on some it's never been
02:54:39.72 --> 02:54:46.76 and the only downside was the mood to fall in at the time wasn't very well received i mean
02:54:47.40 --> 02:54:53.000 you imagine on your home in beautiful sandier having your kids go to school here
02:54:53.000 --> 02:55:02.04 taking your college graduate wives and say let's unload it all we're going up to the moon to live
02:55:02.92 --> 02:55:09.72 and i'm just a god it's really a sad story they get up there and they found some some
02:55:11.32 --> 02:55:19.32 some bad things up there and and then the other thing was the opposition within the navy and i'm
02:55:19.32 --> 02:55:28.52 speaking personally now was all has always been apparent by that it used to be fighter pilots
02:55:28.52 --> 02:55:35.72 and attack pilots and attack pilots after the movie came out after Tom Cruise first movie
02:55:35.72 --> 02:55:43.56 shit boy they were all over it's they didn't like that one bit and the guys guys fought their way
02:55:43.56 --> 02:55:53.88 through it 42 seals in order anyhow that's another well obviously got more books in yeah
02:55:55.24 --> 02:55:59.96 got a lot more books i got one got one work
02:56:02.04 --> 02:56:11.32 meanwhile this is an over yet you know you you say here home with my family for a rare Friday night
02:56:11.32 --> 02:56:15.64 this is 1973 hours barbeque mistakes thinking about taking an after dinner swim with the kids
02:56:15.64 --> 02:56:20.12 when the phone rang i went to pick it up sensing something was wrong as it turned out i was right
02:56:20.12 --> 02:56:25.40 the executive officer of fighter squadron 143 the pukenedogs was missing an action in south
02:56:25.40 --> 02:56:31.64 Vietnam that pilot hardly haul was a friend of mine the squadron was in a state of shock
02:56:31.64 --> 02:56:37.40 it also needed a new exo which accounted for my emergency orders to pack up within 20 hours and
02:56:37.40 --> 02:56:46.12 begin the long journey out to the enterprise you've been there you guys have seen that i'm sure
02:56:47.32 --> 02:56:55.80 yeah i mean uh the it's what we sign up for but it doesn't make it easy it's harder and the family
02:56:55.80 --> 02:57:06.04 anybody you know you show up 24 hours later a navy sea two took me aboard at
02:57:06.04 --> 02:57:11.88 qb point foome out to the carrier the squadron seal gordon cornell met me on the flight deck gordo
02:57:11.88 --> 02:57:17.40 was a warrior's warrior a man who'd flown everything from f9 f panthers to f eight crusaders
02:57:17.40 --> 02:57:23.000 and f four phanams wounded an action over north Vietnam in 1966 he went on to earn two distinguished
02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:28.68 flying crosses and seventeen air metals really got glad to see you yank sorry it had to be
02:57:28.68 --> 02:57:34.60 under such terrible circumstances i shook his hand and asked how the dogs were doing their dogs
02:57:34.60 --> 02:57:41.32 down they'll always be okay their tough bunch bonded as Harley would have wanted still clutching
02:57:41.32 --> 02:57:49.000 my hand he seemed to reconsider this he added their herding badly some of the guys can't wait to get home
02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:55.08 and help out Mary Lou and the kids there was sadness in his eyes the shooting war was over
02:57:55.08 --> 02:58:02.52 but we all had wounds to heal as twenty minutes before the armances became effective
02:58:02.52 --> 02:58:12.04 the whole the an armor
02:58:12.04 --> 02:58:16.20 every fighter pilot wants a command of his own squadron i learned i was to become the
02:58:16.20 --> 02:58:22.52 skipper of the pukendogs again i'm fast boarding at at this point at i'm gonna jump to a part
02:58:22.52 --> 02:58:29.08 where you're heading to Las Vegas at the end of August for an enormous reunion of american
02:58:29.08 --> 02:58:34.52 aviators of all services who had phoned in Vietnam we would unofficially welcome back the 166 men
02:58:34.52 --> 02:58:39.88 taken prisoner by the north Vietnamese some three thousand of us and our wives gathered at the
02:58:39.88 --> 02:58:44.76 hilton there were many spontaneous many reunions that night as old friend saw each other for the first
02:58:44.76 --> 02:58:50.04 time and years the happiness touched everyone the war over the years of hardship and rear view mirror
02:58:50.04 --> 02:58:56.20 at last our former POWs were ready to pick up their lives and careers what an enormous challenge
02:58:56.20 --> 02:59:01.32 some came home knowing nothing of the summer of love the wats riots the ken state shootings
02:59:01.32 --> 02:59:06.84 or the assassinations of martin Luther King and robbered fkennity the last experience of america
02:59:06.84 --> 02:59:12.44 predated acid rock and woodstock fitting into the here and now and getting to know their

03:03:23.88 --> 03:03:33.32 awesome i was laughing this is a laughable comment but i got to say you know we have back in the
03:03:33.32 --> 03:03:40.44 day in the sealed teams we would deploy with our maritime equipment some of that maritime equipment
03:03:40.44 --> 03:03:50.28 is 55 horsepower engines and we were in our couple tunes we were deploying on a ship and when i was
03:03:50.28 --> 03:03:55.24 reading what you were writing about the aircraft you got their own personalities and you what you
03:03:55.24 --> 03:03:59.48 and the exact same thing happened we came home from one deployment and they said hey we're going to
03:03:59.48 --> 03:04:02.68 take in your old ones we're going to take your old engines we're going to send him in for maintenance
03:04:02.68 --> 03:04:07.56 you were giving you guys some new ones and my my first lieutenant rep who was in charge of the
03:04:07.56 --> 03:04:14.12 engines the guy named z the zulu cap we used to call him he says well i'm not giving him up and he
03:04:14.12 --> 03:04:18.60 had names for all the engines you we had one called frank and started one called big cat they
03:04:18.60 --> 03:04:24.92 they all had names and he knew him he knew him and rather than get brand new engines he said no
03:04:24.92 --> 03:04:31.16 i want these engines i want the same engines and the caveatie golf just like okay you want these
03:04:31.16 --> 03:04:34.84 old engines he said yes i do these are the ones that work these are the ones that i know
03:04:36.84 --> 03:04:40.44 the devil's the devil you know is better than the one you don't know right hey my the airplane
03:04:42.12 --> 03:04:51.64 tell us a little bit about uh gunner king oh god bob bob king warner officer gunner
03:04:51.64 --> 03:05:04.44 had been with i first heard about him with the seals the seals many years ago and
03:05:06.36 --> 03:05:13.000 they said the fighter scorn and they said we're going to send you a we're going to send you a
03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:20.52 warner officer seal he's going to be your air gunner and i think what was that mean was an air gunner
03:05:20.52 --> 03:05:28.68 he knew everything to do with a warner and some missiles on the air plane and uh and he
03:05:28.68 --> 03:05:36.28 held a new it all stand on his head he was that good but big talk good looking guy personality
03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:43.64 crazy everybody in this squad and loved him and one night and could be a could be point at the
03:05:43.64 --> 03:05:50.68 oh cup i got him only time i ever got him tell me any seal stories you know we have the air
03:05:50.68 --> 03:05:58.68 deals all wonder about you guys you know we really depressed and everything and i got gunner
03:05:58.68 --> 03:06:05.40 talking to me and i said gunner how did you end up here and he said i was
03:06:05.40 --> 03:06:15.64 inserted in northean um and uh i think the guy with him was killed and there were two of
03:06:15.64 --> 03:06:21.24 men there and they were going to put it i think they had a mission to take care of something in there
03:06:22.28 --> 03:06:33.24 nicely said okay and he said i lost my partner and i got in a river and i'm floating out
03:06:33.24 --> 03:06:44.12 floating out the river ran to the ocean and he said i was floating down this river with
03:06:44.12 --> 03:06:51.88 looking for him along the banks in the air and there and people yelling and he said the only thing
03:06:51.88 --> 03:06:59.40 i'm gonna tell you is he says i felt this warm thing wrap around me you know what it was
03:06:59.40 --> 03:07:07.96 some guy named big sea snake wrapped around him you guys you know what that's like i read about them
03:07:07.96 --> 03:07:20.76 and he said he took out he took out his knife and he got the snake said oh and he said i
03:07:20.76 --> 03:07:27.72 floated out and he said but he said when i when i got out they picked me up he said
03:07:27.72 --> 03:07:37.80 i never could quit dreaming about that day i'm gonna snake and so anyhow i said he said well
03:07:37.80 --> 03:07:42.60 he said didn't want me back and Vietnam anymore they wanted to give my rest i think
03:07:43.40 --> 03:07:49.08 yeah after a lot of things yeah after Vietnam there's a whole group of seals when they
03:07:49.08 --> 03:07:55.32 downside this downside is the seal teams there was a whole group of seals that they sent to the
03:07:55.32 --> 03:07:59.08 fleet and also it might have been because he was a warnafter because i don't know if they knew
03:07:59.08 --> 03:08:04.20 what to do with the warnafters back then in the inside the seal teams and they might have said oh you
03:08:04.20 --> 03:08:09.08 made a warnafter congratulations you're gonna go be a warnafter in the fleet could have been
03:08:09.08 --> 03:08:15.48 either one of those things uh if any of your listeners should know the worry about the warnafter
03:08:15.48 --> 03:08:25.08 bobcane no calling bobby and uh he was remarkable in his capacity as my gunner for two
03:08:25.08 --> 03:08:33.24 cruises and uh wrote to him for a couple years and lots of tight cuddling i think in pomey maybe
03:08:33.24 --> 03:08:40.20 still alive but i just love it if somebody you hold them and let you know so you could tell me
03:08:40.20 --> 03:08:45.56 certainly if somebody knows and there's a lot of guys that listen to this so they'll get the word out
03:08:45.56 --> 03:09:02.12 and try and find uh warnafter bobby king find out where he's at yeah the um you you go into a great
03:09:03.08 --> 03:09:12.36 kind of detailed account of of the Israeli war and how you know you you already mentioned how
03:09:12.36 --> 03:09:21.16 uh how we were able to help out how top gun specifically was able to help out and and also the efforts
03:09:21.16 --> 03:09:26.44 of of the guys and the Israeli you know air force is that what is the Israeli air force?
03:09:26.44 --> 03:09:33.32 oh yeah those two gentlemen that i speak of in the book both went on to be
03:09:34.44 --> 03:09:40.28 commanding generalcy is really air force one of them went on to be the secretary of events in Israel
03:09:40.28 --> 03:09:48.44 and i can't tell you everything i've done with them but uh they are remarkable and you know for years
03:09:48.44 --> 03:09:55.72 i think we'd uh started out maybe living in their shadow a little bit whether tactically
03:09:55.72 --> 03:10:06.44 were as good once top gun came out then we're equal and uh but uh when they come in the United
03:10:06.44 --> 03:10:14.36 States on business i'd get a phone call totally illegally get a phone call it's a Daniel
03:10:15.80 --> 03:10:25.96 and he ton he said i'm in Washington if i come out can i fly with you come on so i fly with him in
03:10:25.96 --> 03:10:34.68 the good story is i got my squadron or airway i can't remember but he calls me and he flies into
03:10:34.68 --> 03:10:41.48 you how he got to you man oh but he she ends up in you man and he said you put me on the
03:10:41.48 --> 03:10:50.20 flights against the model yeah yeah so daylight we rolled on the runway two a wingman i got
03:10:50.20 --> 03:10:56.20 a wingman with me and he's got the second section we break the ground he'll have to turn out to go
03:10:56.20 --> 03:11:07.000 over to the range and he's you gotta hear the sky near he's so cool he said Daniel i said the
03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:19.000 out three he said i got a fire and i said is it bad no it's not bad he said i just shut the engine down
03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:28.20 he unloads fuel all over the range makes one perfect turn around lands rolls all around the runway
03:11:29.32 --> 03:11:39.40 and uh by the time the fire truck's got to him he jumped on the first little tractor that was there
03:11:39.96 --> 03:11:47.32 nobody ever knew he was with a pilot was a guy who played that's just a smooth mother
03:11:47.32 --> 03:11:57.08 and boy could he fly got done the pretty good pretty good and uh we did get top gun at one time with
03:11:57.64 --> 03:12:04.28 mug's muckoo and gave my wire planes in order for their survival and that war
03:12:06.92 --> 03:12:12.52 i promise to take Bethlehem to Israel here as soon as we get rid of this lovely
03:12:12.52 --> 03:12:23.48 nightmare in right now guys go for one two long go and back to the book 40 miles off south
03:12:23.48 --> 03:12:30.68 Vietnam April 29th 1975 for naval aviation the problem of Vietnam never seemed to go away
03:12:31.72 --> 03:12:37.96 Lieutenant Darrell Condor Gary stood before the assembled pilots and reels of VF51 in
03:12:37.96 --> 03:12:43.32 Darrell's short career he'd been thrown into the air war over North Vietnam before completing his
03:12:43.32 --> 03:12:49.88 rag training back in the late 1960s as an F4 backseater two tours there and he came home in time
03:12:49.88 --> 03:12:54.12 for me to pull him into top gun as one of our instructors he subsequently went back to flight
03:12:54.12 --> 03:12:58.60 school became an F4 pilot and went through top gun as a student before heading out to the
03:12:59.24 --> 03:13:04.52 carrier USS coral sea and his first overseas deployment as a fighter pilot in 1975
03:13:04.52 --> 03:13:10.92 he was a young lieutenant tasked with delivering one of the most painful briefs the squadron would ever
03:13:10.92 --> 03:13:19.000 receive it fell to Condor to bring them the news that we were abandoning our allies once and for all
03:13:23.40 --> 03:13:31.24 that's the only time I've ever seen him said I would say keg they are erwin commander about this
03:13:31.24 --> 03:13:42.36 guy do it actually when in flu cover over the healing copters and healing copters and
03:13:42.36 --> 03:13:48.76 watch the accident people going out both loads of people trying to get on the carriers and he came
03:13:48.76 --> 03:13:58.84 back and he just he couldn't he just so upset him there's a print of a man you know a lot of times
03:13:58.84 --> 03:14:05.56 I read books while in fact I only read books from people's first persons account of war
03:14:06.92 --> 03:14:11.48 because you know you I want people to understand what it's like to be there
03:14:12.76 --> 03:14:18.68 and one thing that you do in this book that you do very well is the way you connect the guys that are
03:14:18.68 --> 03:14:25.56 there with the overall picture and that's exactly what you did right here because so you've got
03:14:25.56 --> 03:14:31.88 Condor briefing the guys that we're leaving and then you go into this with the last flight to the midway
03:14:31.88 --> 03:14:40.68 from the embassy grounds 1,373 Americans in 5,595 Vietnamese were helicoptered to the naval task force
03:14:40.68 --> 03:14:46.52 another 65,000 fled by boat later to be picked up by one of the 40 ships offshore
03:14:46.52 --> 03:14:56.44 the fixed wing air crowd air lift from Tansong nut pulled out another 50,493 including almost
03:14:56.44 --> 03:15:04.04 2700 orphans they were the lucky ones in the immediate aftermath of South Vietnam's collapse
03:15:04.04 --> 03:15:12.28 more than 150,000 civilians vanished most either executed outright or thrown into concentration camps
03:15:12.28 --> 03:15:19.80 Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City a memorial to the unknown masses of dead somewhere between
03:15:19.80 --> 03:15:27.96 one and four million Vietnamese perished from 1955 to 1975 in Cambodia another 300,000 were killed
03:15:27.96 --> 03:15:33.32 Louseloss between 20 and 60,000 in the years ahead the killing would continue as communist and
03:15:33.32 --> 03:15:39.08 surgeons toppled the governments of Louseloss in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979 the
03:15:39.08 --> 03:15:44.12 Commir Rouge a regime that swept to power in the wake of America's exit from the region
03:15:44.12 --> 03:15:50.12 murdered or starve to death about 2.5 million people out of a population of 8 million
03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:57.88 more than 30% of the entire nation when Americans look back at Vietnam we remember the domestic
03:15:57.88 --> 03:16:05.32 unrest we think two of the 58,000 names memorialized on that long black marble wall in Washington
03:16:05.32 --> 03:16:13.40 those are important to remember but few want to discuss the other consequences of America's lost war
03:16:22.36 --> 03:16:29.72 You know there's a lot of connections with a lot of different things and I've been recently talking to a guy
03:16:29.72 --> 03:16:40.68 who's connected to some people that were on this operation when the ship that named the
03:16:40.68 --> 03:16:49.48 My Guest how do you say it? My Guest. The My Guest was captured by the Cambonians and I'm looking
03:16:49.48 --> 03:16:56.12 to get one of these Marines on the podcast to kind of recount what happened so it was very interesting
03:16:56.12 --> 03:17:03.16 to me when I read that you were involved in this so the Cambodians had seized an American flagged
03:17:03.16 --> 03:17:09.16 and owned cargo container ship now the ship was in Camilla Rouge hands and I'm jumping through
03:17:09.16 --> 03:17:13.16 just to hit some of these highlights on the afternoon of the 14th president Gerald Ford ordered
03:17:13.16 --> 03:17:19.96 the seventh Air Force to execute a helicopter assault on Coteang Island and the My Guest
03:17:19.96 --> 03:17:26.12 The forces landing on the island were to find the crew if there were any while another team helicopter
03:17:26.12 --> 03:17:30.84 onto the My Guest and steamed it out in the international waters just before the rescue and in
03:17:30.84 --> 03:17:36.28 Admiral Cougan received a direct call from President Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
03:17:36.28 --> 03:17:40.84 I was with him in the coral seas flag headquarters and listened with great interest.
03:17:40.84 --> 03:17:46.44 President Ford ordered the carrier to strike targets on Cambodian mainland including port facilities
03:17:46.44 --> 03:17:53.64 and a nearby naval base, Naval Base. Admiral the president said go get our ship and crew back
03:17:53.64 --> 03:18:01.08 it's your show. Use all available means but no nooks. I wondered how many times our commanders
03:18:01.08 --> 03:18:07.48 on Yankee Station the dirt such a command not even Nixon ever expressed such a clear and
03:18:07.48 --> 03:18:14.44 explicit willingness to let us fight. And so you you know I skipped through this part but you
03:18:14.44 --> 03:18:22.68 were actually there to take over this this squadron. No airway. Airway and the guy that was running
03:18:22.68 --> 03:18:27.32 it said you're gonna have to wait a little bit to listen over. Nobody passes up good combat.
03:18:28.12 --> 03:18:37.40 Excuse me that's portoy support. Yeah. Leadership. Right. Right. The CIA believe that
03:18:37.40 --> 03:18:44.04 content, co-ting was lightly defended if at all in fact more than a hundred commirus troops held
03:18:44.04 --> 03:18:49.24 the island to deter their communist brothers from North Vietnam who had laid claim to these patches
03:18:49.24 --> 03:18:55.64 off the Indo Chinese coast. Armourines rolled into hot landing zones, laced with machine gun
03:18:57.48 --> 03:19:03.32 and rocket propelled grenade fire. From the ship, Darrell watched a several CH53 heavy transport
03:19:03.32 --> 03:19:09.48 helicopters took hits one crashed offshore after receiving two RGB RG RPG hits. The survivors
03:19:09.48 --> 03:19:14.12 were in the water for hours until a gig from one of our escorts pulled them to safety. Including
03:19:14.12 --> 03:19:18.20 those survivors was the Marine Forward Air Controller who somehow found an Air Force survival
03:19:18.20 --> 03:19:23.56 radio that he used to call targets for the eight seven course airs overhead, clinging to records.
03:19:23.56 --> 03:19:27.96 The radio's battery slowly failing. He gave everything he had to try and secure help for the
03:19:27.96 --> 03:19:33.88 embattled Marines pinned down in the landing zone. Three CH53 Jolly Green Giants went down during
03:19:33.88 --> 03:19:39.88 the rescue operation. Fifteen Marines were killed on Co-Tang and 50 more wounded during the fire
03:19:39.88 --> 03:19:45.24 the fighting that rage throughout the day. Meanwhile our attacker crafts saturated the myugas
03:19:45.24 --> 03:19:49.80 with tear gas and American warship racing to the anchorage with a company of Marines aboard
03:19:49.80 --> 03:19:54.36 an hour later the assault after an hour after the assault in the island began the Marines
03:19:54.36 --> 03:19:59.56 clad and gas masks swarmed the cargo of the ship and founded abandoned. We had our ship back but
03:19:59.56 --> 03:20:04.52 where was the crew. The comir had released them sending them back out to see who are navy patrol
03:20:04.52 --> 03:20:09.56 planes spotted them. Another American warship steam to the vessel pulled the crew aboard just
03:20:09.56 --> 03:20:14.36 before the lunch hour. The final act played out through the afternoon as the Air Force tried to
03:20:14.36 --> 03:20:19.96 extract the Marines from the landing zones. Heavy fire repeatedly drove them off and one battle
03:20:19.96 --> 03:20:26.28 damage Jolly Green Giants forced landed on the coral seas deck. Our maintainers swiftly
03:20:26.28 --> 03:20:31.72 patched it up a few hours later went back in action the fighting raged and our frustration level
03:20:31.72 --> 03:20:37.48 grew. The birds kept taking hits and the Marines were reporting heavy casualties by dinner and air
03:20:37.48 --> 03:20:43.88 fear force brought an AC 130 gunship and 5C 130's carrying 15,000 pound bombs known as
03:20:43.88 --> 03:20:50.04 Blue 82's nicknamed Daisy Cutters. They were the biggest, most destructive conventional weapons in
03:20:50.04 --> 03:20:55.72 the American arsenal. The first one detonated is Darrell noters watched from our deck Darrell saw
03:20:55.72 --> 03:21:02.52 the enormous explosion followed by a shockwave. The blast unleashed. It was obscured by the island.
03:21:02.52 --> 03:21:06.68 It obscured the island and swept right across the coral sea causing the huge carrier to shutter
03:21:06.68 --> 03:21:12.44 from its impact. As darkness fell another Jolly Green staggered out of the moon list night.
03:21:12.44 --> 03:21:17.72 The massive helicopter carried a crew of five and managed to pull aboard 34 Marines before
03:21:17.72 --> 03:21:22.60 suffering engine travel. The crew set down on the carriers deck and when it's ramp dropped almost
03:21:22.60 --> 03:21:28.44 three dozen wounded Marines tumbleed out onto the flight deck. The 15 Marines killed on
03:21:28.44 --> 03:21:34.52 Coteang Island became the final men whose names were etched into the wall and washington a decade later.
03:21:35.88 --> 03:21:40.36 Three more Marines declared missing an action on the island were captured by the Cameroos
03:21:40.36 --> 03:21:49.40 and later beaten to death. After we took our wounded Marines to Subic Bay we steamed south
03:21:49.40 --> 03:21:54.84 the birth for a 10 day port call. The Aussies welcomed us with great hospitality. We were treated
03:21:54.84 --> 03:21:59.56 like family everywhere we went. The crew drank and laughed with our friends from down under and put
03:21:59.56 --> 03:22:05.16 the scars of the war in our rearview mirrors. By the end of it I was so exhausted from all the
03:22:05.16 --> 03:22:10.84 free drinks and parties that I crawled into my bunk and slept the sleep of a free man. The world
03:22:10.84 --> 03:22:27.32 was at peace for the first time in 10 years. Roughly to close it out. Roughly to close out the war.
03:22:27.32 --> 03:22:36.92 Never never let a men's sirt Marines unless a Marine helicopter sets a number one less
03:22:36.92 --> 03:22:44.04 than we learned or that those were Air Force, Dally Green, Saur, Air Point but they never had
03:22:44.04 --> 03:22:53.40 inserted and they weren't ready and we heard that Air Force general he heard that operation.
03:22:53.40 --> 03:23:06.68 I got to fly. I took 12 or maybe 16 I can remember but I went downtown.
03:23:09.000 --> 03:23:19.40 The capital city. I went downtown. The 500 knots at 500 feet. Right to the downtown
03:23:19.40 --> 03:23:26.04 shock and I was looking for a sea of any makes came out or whether there were makes there.
03:23:27.16 --> 03:23:36.36 But when it was over we were just glad. The the corpsmen and the doctors on the carrier did
03:23:36.36 --> 03:23:41.64 surgery on those 30 Marines and everyone on the loose. It was awesome.
03:23:41.64 --> 03:23:52.20 Yeah. But the big lesson in that is we had a president who said, I don't know if you're
03:23:52.20 --> 03:23:59.56 sure. Don't use nukes but anything else goes. Yeah. And he did. That's decentralized command.
03:23:59.56 --> 03:24:06.20 That's how it's let the frontline leaders make the decisions to win. That's the key.
03:24:06.20 --> 03:24:13.96 Decision to win until your people will let them do it. They know how.
03:24:18.84 --> 03:24:25.56 This section here is about the Tomcat. The F-14 Tomcat almost never made it into the world.
03:24:26.12 --> 03:24:31.48 Thanks to Secretary Defense Robert S. McNamara who loved to think he knew people's business
03:24:31.48 --> 03:24:38.28 better than they did. In 1968 he tried to force the Navy to adopt the whole King F-111 fighter
03:24:38.28 --> 03:24:45.000 bomber for use on aircraft carriers. Imagine Sec Deft's Shagrin. When a mere three-star
03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:50.28 admiral, the head of Naval Aviation at the Pentagon decided to stand in his way.
03:24:51.16 --> 03:24:57.48 That truth telling sailor Tom Connelly testified to Congress. Quote, there isn't enough
03:24:57.48 --> 03:25:03.88 thrust and Christian to make that airplane into a fighter and quote. And he won. The Navy avoided
03:25:03.88 --> 03:25:09.80 being settled with the flying etsl so named by its unhappy air force pilots because of its
03:25:09.80 --> 03:25:14.36 because it's chief advocate, Secretary McNamara had been president of Ford Motor Company.
03:25:15.08 --> 03:25:21.16 McNamara took his revenge denying Vice Admiral Connelly a deserved promotion to a fourth star.
03:25:21.16 --> 03:25:26.60 But the last word belonged to the Navy. It paid tribute to the great man by naming its new
03:25:26.60 --> 03:25:33.32 world-beating fighter aircraft after him. The legendary Tom Cat was born. Though it fell
03:25:33.32 --> 03:25:38.68 right in line with other grum and felines in history, Wildcat Hellcat Bearcat and Tiger Cat,
03:25:38.68 --> 03:25:48.12 the name was the Artful Final Act in a Pentagon dogfight. That is totally legit.
03:25:49.08 --> 03:25:54.76 The crazy thing is, you know, this is this is McNamara again, you know, with the with the
03:25:54.76 --> 03:25:59.64 giant ego. Thinking he knows more than people that are actually, that are actually doing little
03:25:59.64 --> 03:26:03.56 things like landing the aircraft on aircraft carriers in the middle of the night.
03:26:09.64 --> 03:26:13.96 Fast forward a little bit. Through the post-war years, I was at sea more often than not,
03:26:13.96 --> 03:26:18.60 commanding an air wing that included four F4 Phantom Squadrons, swells attack aircraft
03:26:18.60 --> 03:26:22.68 bombers tankers early warning planes and helicopters was one of the most challenging and fun
03:26:22.68 --> 03:26:27.80 jobs I ever had. In some ways, it is also a naval aviators last to raw with the fleet.
03:26:27.80 --> 03:26:31.32 Once you get promoted out of air wing command, your flying days are limited.
03:26:31.32 --> 03:26:35.80 Until that day comes, however, air wing commanders are expected to fly every type of plane in
03:26:35.80 --> 03:26:41.24 their inventory. It was a hair-on-fire experience. In the space of a few days, I might fly an F4
03:26:41.24 --> 03:26:46.76 Phantom and A6 intruder and a helicopter. In battle, I would have been leading strikes and coordinating
03:26:46.76 --> 03:26:51.88 the attacks of my individual squadrons. The jobs a culmination of everything I had learned in
03:26:51.88 --> 03:26:57.96 naval aviators career. All the lessons, all the mentoring by other officers,
03:26:57.96 --> 03:27:04.92 comes in the way an air wing commander chooses to lead his men. Creating a culture of excellence,
03:27:05.72 --> 03:27:13.96 of openness, and of self-avaluation so that your crews can improve and grow is an essential
03:27:13.96 --> 03:27:20.44 element to success. That's something every leader should just get out their notebook and write down.
03:27:20.44 --> 03:27:26.60 Creating a culture of excellence of openness and of self-avaluation so that your crews can improve
03:27:26.60 --> 03:27:32.60 and grow isn't essential element to success. aboard the coral sea, I used the leadership
03:27:32.60 --> 03:27:38.92 techniques we developed at Top Gun to set that framework. I let my squadron commanders run their
03:27:38.92 --> 03:27:48.44 own shows without micro-managing them. That is your life's work of leadership building into that
03:27:48.44 --> 03:27:56.04 attitude and keeping that attitude that you used the top gun to lead in this other situation.
03:27:56.84 --> 03:27:59.16 Still works. If it works, why do you?
03:28:02.52 --> 03:28:07.80 1976, I stepped out of the cockpit for one last time as a full-time aviator and said farewell to my
03:28:07.80 --> 03:28:12.84 air wing. The Navy promoted me to Captain and now as a senior officer at last. While it's still
03:28:12.84 --> 03:28:17.32 get to fly from time to time, the truth was that my days as a combat aviator were over. I suppose
03:28:17.32 --> 03:28:21.64 it would have been harder to take. Had there been nothing but desks jobs on the horizon for me.
03:28:21.64 --> 03:28:26.84 Thank God that was not the case. Ronald Wilson Reagan was my commander in chief, the prestige of
03:28:26.84 --> 03:28:31.96 naval aviation and the military generally was set for resurgence after many years and the
03:28:31.96 --> 03:28:37.32 Dolgrem's falling that would draw from Vietnam. It was a fine time for a newly minted captain
03:28:37.32 --> 03:28:49.24 to take command. I was going to see as the skipper of my own ship. Talk about a wake-up call
03:28:49.24 --> 03:28:55.24 from flying fighters at Mach 2. I found myself navigating the Pacific at 12 knots. On the bridge of
03:28:55.24 --> 03:29:04.12 a 40,000 ton, 660 foot long behemoth, crude by 22 officers in 400 men. While we had two Boeing H46C
03:29:04.12 --> 03:29:08.84 night helicopters to help run vertical replenishment missions between our ship and those we
03:29:08.84 --> 03:29:14.36 service for the first time in my career. I had virtually no connection to flying fixed wing aircraft.
03:29:14.36 --> 03:29:20.92 It was a big transition for me personally. So you took over a ship and this ship is a resupply ship.
03:29:22.92 --> 03:29:30.92 I was on board a ship. A Navy ship. So I'd probably been in the Navy for four years before I
03:29:30.92 --> 03:29:39.96 actually went on a ship for any length of time. I was on board a NLPD, an amphib, and we were out
03:29:39.96 --> 03:29:45.16 and we were doing for the first time. It was an unrep with avert rep. What do they call when they
03:29:45.16 --> 03:29:50.68 combine them together? What's it called? Is it a name for it? Same. Okay. So it's an under-way
03:29:50.68 --> 03:29:56.92 replenishment and a vertical replenishment and then there were doing two ships at the same time.
03:29:56.92 --> 03:30:03.000 One on each side. When I saw this and like I said, I'd been in the SEAL teams for four years or
03:30:03.000 --> 03:30:09.32 three years in the SEAL teams and plus you know going through SEAL training, I could not believe what
03:30:09.32 --> 03:30:15.64 I was watching. This is an insane operation. There's a ship which is the one that you drove
03:30:15.64 --> 03:30:23.16 is the ship in the middle and it's got fuel on it and it's got food on it and they pull these things
03:30:23.16 --> 03:30:31.16 along side each other. They're probably 15 yards apart. Something like that? Little more.
03:30:31.16 --> 03:30:38.20 Little more than that? 120, 140 feet. Okay. So I'm maybe I'm a little bit, you know, I'm maybe
03:30:38.20 --> 03:30:43.000 not remembering. I'll tell you what it looked like to my young eyes. It looked like we were about
03:30:43.000 --> 03:30:48.12 the crash. That's what it looked like. And these, they're going whatever seven or eight,
03:30:48.12 --> 03:30:54.04 ten knots. What's the 12 knots? You're steaming through the sea. These ships are within. What's
03:30:54.04 --> 03:30:58.52 so what is it? We're talking 30 yards apart. They're 30 yards apart from each other. Massive
03:30:58.52 --> 03:31:07.96 vessels. They're connected by a by giant hoses that are pumping oil and gas on board. So there's
03:31:07.96 --> 03:31:12.52 flammable liquid, you know, flowing through these hoses and then on top that you have helicopters
03:31:12.52 --> 03:31:18.76 that are landing and taking off, bringing gear and food from one ship to another. It's insane.
03:31:18.76 --> 03:31:26.20 That's a verd, right, man. It's a really good heel of pilots. Oh yeah. Yeah. We always, you know,
03:31:26.20 --> 03:31:34.12 you were talking about the, you know, air force helicopter pilots or, or for me, the Navy pilots
03:31:34.12 --> 03:31:38.84 were the best pilots we could get when I, when I first got in the Navy because those guys hovered
03:31:38.84 --> 03:31:43.56 at over, they hovered over these ships all the time. That's what they did for a living. So they'd
03:31:43.56 --> 03:31:47.08 come into drop us on a fast rope. They would hold station like it was a joke. They'd be like,
03:31:47.08 --> 03:31:50.92 no problem. Or sit in here. Well, stay here as well. Right where you want us as long as we can.
03:31:52.20 --> 03:31:56.28 But the purpose of you being in command of this ship is so that you can understand the logistics
03:31:56.28 --> 03:32:01.88 of the Navy and how to, oh, sure. How to drive a ship in the hopes that you can do a good enough
03:32:01.88 --> 03:32:07.88 job that they go, okay, this guy can, this guy can manage an aircraft carrier. And, and that's
03:32:07.88 --> 03:32:17.56 what they did. It's a prerequisite. Pre-requisite to get you what you wanted or, I guess, maybe the ultimate
03:32:17.56 --> 03:32:24.28 goal of someone in your shoes was to be in command of an aircraft carrier. And you got it. You got,
03:32:25.16 --> 03:32:29.72 you say this, the Ranger, which was your aircraft carrier, is my ship now, perched on the bridge,
03:32:29.72 --> 03:32:36.04 seated in a barber chair with skipper stencil on its back. I watched the bustle of the flight deck
03:32:36.04 --> 03:32:40.92 from the best seat in the house. I was 46 years old. Still wearing the Ray bands. I bought in
03:32:40.92 --> 03:32:46.04 Pensacola and the Star of David chain around my neck that was given to you by your Israeli friends.
03:32:46.04 --> 03:32:50.28 My little mouse from North Island was tucked away in the captain's cabin a few yards,
03:32:50.28 --> 03:32:56.60 after my chair. These three towels min served every day as a reminder of who I was and where I came
03:32:56.60 --> 03:33:00.04 from since I first climbed into the cockpit in Pensacola.
03:33:00.04 --> 03:33:10.84 As you start talking about, so what year is this? This is like 81, 82,
03:33:10.84 --> 03:33:17.88 on the carrier. Yeah. 80, 80, 81, 82. You start talking about the fact that there's a,
03:33:18.44 --> 03:33:24.60 there's a drug problem in the Navy. There's a number one problem in my entire
03:33:24.60 --> 03:33:33.08 time on ships. What's a drugs? And you're dealing with this. You have guys getting in trouble.
03:33:33.08 --> 03:33:37.24 You have guys trying to kill themselves. I mean, you detail this again from a leadership perspective.
03:33:37.24 --> 03:33:43.72 It's a great part of the book. And then there's something else that happens that I'm going to
03:33:43.72 --> 03:33:49.48 go into here. My ship's company suffered a terrible tragedy. A young airman named Paul.
03:33:49.48 --> 03:33:56.44 How do you say his last name? Taurus. Taurus. Taurus. Taurus. Collapsed and died while we were at
03:33:56.44 --> 03:34:00.36 Subic Bay about three weeks after we rescued some refugees which you go into.
03:34:01.08 --> 03:34:05.96 Taurus was a sad story. A 20 year old from Michigan who's time in uniform as a case study
03:34:05.96 --> 03:34:10.60 in the devastation wrought by drugs in our Navy. Having served for three years he had never been
03:34:10.60 --> 03:34:15.32 promoted. In fact, he was in frequent trouble and tried to desert twice. His squadron commander
03:34:15.32 --> 03:34:21.000 disciplined him repeatedly. He was no stranger to our correctional custody training unit or CCU.
03:34:21.96 --> 03:34:27.40 Nothing seemed to work. He remained an often belligerent hard case who frustrated his squadron
03:34:27.40 --> 03:34:32.60 commander. I never met this sailor, but his death changed my life forever. The ship had just
03:34:32.60 --> 03:34:38.04 returned from a five day visit to Hong Kong where he was an unauthorized absentee.
03:34:38.04 --> 03:34:45.72 He was next in the CCU that April of 1981. My understanding from the Navy investigation that
03:34:45.72 --> 03:34:51.64 followed his death is that combat. As always, he fought with a couple of our senior pedi officers who
03:34:51.64 --> 03:34:57.96 then took him up on the flight deck in order to start jogging. It was routine exercise in the
03:34:57.96 --> 03:35:06.28 swell-turing Subic Bay heat. Taurus had previously been restricted to bread and water as a result
03:35:06.28 --> 03:35:11.56 of his combativeness. As he was running, he collapsed. Taken below. He began to have seizures.
03:35:11.56 --> 03:35:16.36 30 minutes later, medical personnel arrived to treat him, but sadly he died soon after. The Navy
03:35:16.36 --> 03:35:20.36 determined he had gone into cardiac arrest as a result of heat exhaustion.
03:35:26.44 --> 03:35:33.32 So this is just a horrible situation. And
03:35:33.32 --> 03:35:49.96 there's an investigation. They get done with the investigation. You get a punitive letter or non-punitive
03:35:49.96 --> 03:35:56.12 letter. So you get a letter that says, hey, this shouldn't happen because as we know, a commanding
03:35:56.12 --> 03:36:04.04 officer's responsible for everything that happens. That's key right there. Five thousand, four hundred
03:36:04.04 --> 03:36:11.96 guys, and one of them happens to be on drugs. My guys, the medical department made a couple of mistakes.
03:36:11.96 --> 03:36:21.32 The Mo1 nervous once time was unacceptable. That young fellow is disciplined. On the carrier,
03:36:21.32 --> 03:36:29.16 I let the squadron commanders run their own discipline cases. And they work a long time
03:36:29.56 --> 03:36:37.32 to become a commander of a squadron. No doubt. So I let them do it. And his squadron commander that
03:36:37.32 --> 03:36:47.32 young man was, he was a patty, too easy. A guy had been the mass about four or five times.
03:36:47.32 --> 03:36:54.52 He should have thrown his ass out of the military. But he just kept going back to his drugs.
03:36:55.56 --> 03:37:06.76 And ultimately died. And his parents were very successful people in Michigan.
03:37:06.76 --> 03:37:18.12 And then through the Washington bureaucracy, SUNY, for $8 million, maybe went through grand jury
03:37:18.12 --> 03:37:27.96 in Washington. They found, you know, I wasn't liable for anything except that you become a political
03:37:27.96 --> 03:37:38.60 liability in Washington as a senior naval officer. And that's what happened. And I don't think we
03:37:38.60 --> 03:37:45.24 need to put any of this in. I'm gonna, I've addressed it in the new book. But what happened was,
03:37:45.24 --> 03:37:52.52 I went, I got a great job out of the carrier tour. They sent me to to a sing-pack fleeing.
03:37:52.52 --> 03:38:00.36 And I got the current officer job. Which you do cover that in his book. And I'll let you out.
03:38:00.36 --> 03:38:05.72 Well, no, it's all right. It's all right. I got a phone call from CNN. Is that in there? Yeah,
03:38:05.72 --> 03:38:10.60 that's in there. Go ahead then. Well, you're gonna cover. I just want to make sure that
03:38:10.60 --> 03:38:16.68 the three of you understand that. I got a call from CNN and invited me to back to Washington.
03:38:16.68 --> 03:38:25.000 I flew back. It's been a whole morning at Moldim Watkins, a new sub-mariner. I'd worked for before.
03:38:25.000 --> 03:38:33.80 He knew me well. And he says, I just spent the whole morning drink coffee and smoke a cigarette
03:38:33.80 --> 03:38:41.64 with him. And he said, I did everything I could do. And I know it's true because I can cover a
03:38:41.64 --> 03:38:51.16 collaboration from his what he said, me said. But politically, he said, stay in the Navy.
03:38:52.28 --> 03:39:01.08 And I'll see you're so like, did I meant so like and for flying? And I looked at the who the
03:39:01.08 --> 03:39:11.48 opposition was a senator for Michigan. And you can tell it's a tough thing to talk about. And he was
03:39:12.20 --> 03:39:17.72 going to be Germany armed services committee. This senator from Michigan was going to be chairman
03:39:18.28 --> 03:39:27.96 Carl 11. And so I was never he's a one that sponsored the lawsuit on the I of the family.
03:39:27.96 --> 03:39:36.52 He controls five federal judges and I thought shit, it's over. So I went back and talked to
03:39:37.16 --> 03:39:43.24 talked to a home and talked to my wife and got out of the Navy two weeks later.
03:39:45.16 --> 03:39:48.04 And I just had a great time.
03:39:49.64 --> 03:39:54.36 Yeah, it's it's a it's a strange things for civilians may not realize this when you become when you
03:39:54.36 --> 03:40:01.64 get selected for admiral it has to be approved by a conderson and or yeah and it's like you said
03:40:01.64 --> 03:40:06.44 it's a very political thing. And I've seen it I've seen get some guys get ripped apart by it.
03:40:06.44 --> 03:40:13.08 Something will come up and people will protest and it's a political thing. And as you say here
03:40:13.08 --> 03:40:18.36 that's just how Washington worked. I resigned my staff position and retired two weeks later on March
03:40:18.36 --> 03:40:31.80 first 1983 after 29 years one month and one day in uniform. It's a it's a you know you talked
03:40:31.80 --> 03:40:37.64 earlier about how in combat you can make the right decisions you can do the right thing you can have
03:40:37.64 --> 03:40:46.44 the right plan and you can still something can still go wrong. And it's a very risky thing when you get
03:40:46.44 --> 03:40:51.80 to those high ranks in the Navy you can do the right thing you can know the right people and you can
03:40:51.80 --> 03:41:01.72 still get tripped up in that the last the last hurdle by by the smallest by something that's
03:41:03.08 --> 03:41:14.68 yeah. So transition when I returned to California that spring I felt like a refugee in my own home
03:41:14.68 --> 03:41:20.20 town. I was almost 50 years old starting over from scratch I needed to find a new sense of normal
03:41:20.20 --> 03:41:25.72 for me normal is waking up in my cabin to the smell of salt air coming through a brass port hole.
03:41:26.76 --> 03:41:32.28 It was the heavy jolt of a catapult launch the euphoria of breaking mock one in a vertical climb.
03:41:32.28 --> 03:41:38.60 It was long beautiful nights night flights across our country and the sense of purpose I felt when
03:41:38.60 --> 03:41:45.08 we saved lives it's see it was the fear of flying strikes in the north Vietnam the honor of leading
03:41:45.08 --> 03:41:50.76 top gun alongside some of the finest young man America'd ever produced it was welcoming old friends
03:41:50.76 --> 03:41:55.96 back from the Hanoi Hilton and holding membership in a brotherhood that defined my entire adult life.
03:41:57.80 --> 03:42:03.88 In civilian life it was no normal for me. I struggled. My first marriage did not survive
03:42:03.88 --> 03:42:08.44 the many deployments of the 1970s being gone so much finally drove a wedge between us that could not
03:42:08.44 --> 03:42:13.40 be removed. I married a second time while serving in surface ships. Every the optimist I guess
03:42:13.40 --> 03:42:18.52 it wasn't meant to be. I could have gone on to into the defense industry like so many other
03:42:18.52 --> 03:42:23.48 retired military offers do great salaries great benefits. I refused to do that instead I went
03:42:23.48 --> 03:42:28.36 into business for myself and Southern California. The leadership principles I learned in the navy
03:42:28.36 --> 03:42:36.52 played a large role in my success. What business did you get into? I worked in her team and
03:42:36.52 --> 03:42:43.48 in the street for a while and then I built. I couldn't build anything. She can she visualise that I
03:42:43.48 --> 03:42:55.40 could build it. We did a lot of beautiful homes and stuff like that. You know you detail the
03:42:55.40 --> 03:43:01.64 I guess I'm going to use the word. I don't know if this word's been used on this podcast before
03:43:01.64 --> 03:43:07.72 brace yourself. You detail the romantic aspect of this the way this folds unfolds in the book and
03:43:07.72 --> 03:43:15.000 it's just a beautiful story about you know Mary Beth you guys you know connect again during
03:43:15.000 --> 03:43:28.12 all this turmoil and you end up with the girl that you originally fell in love with. So again
03:43:28.12 --> 03:43:37.16 that's another aspect that you got to you got to read the book to to understand. You also go into
03:43:37.16 --> 03:43:47.24 the F-35 and what that program consists of and what the shortfalls are and what the shortfalls
03:43:47.24 --> 03:43:51.32 of the training program can be and what they have to watch out for and like you talked about
03:43:51.32 --> 03:43:59.48 early the struggles of the top-gun program and you know when you get to it you got to a point
03:43:59.48 --> 03:44:03.96 in the end of the book here where you start talking about what a winning team. If you were going
03:44:03.96 --> 03:44:07.88 to build a winning team what it would look like I'm just going to summarize some of the things you say.
03:44:08.44 --> 03:44:13.08 You say because the basic truth of fighter combat remains the same it is not the aircraft that
03:44:13.08 --> 03:44:18.76 wins a fight it's the man in the cockpit flying is a perishable skill it has to be practiced
03:44:18.76 --> 03:44:25.32 constantly and maintained on a consistent basis. My boys will all be dogfighters with enough planes
03:44:25.80 --> 03:44:30.36 in inventory we can return to the days when any pilot who's who's in good with the senior
03:44:30.36 --> 03:44:35.80 chief in maintenance control can check out a burn and go find a fight club somewhere off the coast.
03:44:35.80 --> 03:44:42.04 That's how we'll sharpen our edge and dark fog fighting again. I run through this mental exercise
03:44:42.04 --> 03:44:49.08 often. I always come back to this our top-gun maximum. What matters is the man not the machine.
03:44:49.08 --> 03:44:53.96 So let's talk about what a good fighter pilot candidate looks like over the years and thousands
03:44:53.96 --> 03:45:01.72 of aviators I've known I've noticed the best share some common traits a good pilot would have
03:45:01.72 --> 03:45:07.24 a multi a patriotic mindset and a self-starting work ethic. He should believe in something
03:45:07.24 --> 03:45:12.52 greater than himself while remaining self-reliant and confident without being overbearing.
03:45:12.52 --> 03:45:18.60 Some ego is necessary. I wouldn't want a soul filled without flying in my wing and athletic
03:45:18.60 --> 03:45:24.20 background helps because when properly coached at the right age youngsters learn trust, teamwork,
03:45:24.20 --> 03:45:30.44 and goal setting. They'll need all those things in the air. I'll pass on anybody who displays
03:45:30.44 --> 03:45:37.40 his participation trophies. Self esteem without real accomplishment will make anyone crash and burn.
03:45:38.28 --> 03:45:44.44 Give me a committed B student with a boiling will to win over an A plus scholar with a careerist
03:45:44.44 --> 03:45:51.000 agenda and will be on our way. Finally it's important to have a sincere interest in the history
03:45:51.000 --> 03:45:56.92 and lore of your calling. Good pilot strive constantly for self-improvement. In my first years
03:45:56.92 --> 03:46:01.64 in the Navy I had the opportunity to meet the World War II generation and hear their stories and
03:46:01.64 --> 03:46:11.000 lessons. I read every combat memoir I could could and glean a lot of little things from them that
03:46:11.000 --> 03:46:16.68 helped me in my journey. We lived on the edge of life and death and the margin between them was
03:46:16.68 --> 03:46:23.96 narrow. I think Jimmy do little bought me a scotch and that's a story you tell earlier because
03:46:23.96 --> 03:46:31.000 he saw that we had shared residency there. History is a wellspring of life saving lessons. No
03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:38.76 one really invents anything. Successful leaders recognize those traits and encourage them even at the
03:46:38.76 --> 03:46:49.88 risk of bending a rule or a jet once in a while. And you close out the book with this. Well that's
03:46:49.88 --> 03:46:57.000 what naval aviation would look like if I were king of everything. Since I'm not, I think I
03:46:57.000 --> 03:47:04.52 ought to call it a night. Come on inside. I have one last thing to show you. I kept my 1950s Ray
03:47:04.52 --> 03:47:09.16 Bands until just a few years ago when I replaced the lenses and gave them to my granddaughter
03:47:09.16 --> 03:47:14.44 at her request as a Christmas gift. At 50 years I figured it was time for a new pair.
03:47:15.72 --> 03:47:20.12 My youngest daughter Candace ended up with my star of David and Gold Chain.
03:47:21.16 --> 03:47:27.80 But I still have my little mouse. After all the C-duty he endured, he enjoys a cushy retirement
03:47:27.80 --> 03:47:32.92 on my bookshelf. From time to time I look at him and say it was a hell of a ride,
03:47:32.92 --> 03:47:39.24 wasn't it little fella. He is surrounded by books and other treasured items from my career.
03:47:40.36 --> 03:47:47.24 But what I value most was my time at Miramar with the Bros. They're enduring friendship
03:47:47.64 --> 03:47:54.68 or my real treasures, not any physical things in my library. Top Gun will always be the centerpiece
03:47:54.68 --> 03:48:01.64 of my career and my life's most important accomplishment. None of it would have happened without the
03:48:01.64 --> 03:48:10.36 Bros or the ever-present hands of God. Thank you.
03:48:17.16 --> 03:48:28.92 Yeah. You know what you do? You're really my compliments. And you know,
03:48:28.92 --> 03:48:37.24 it didn't in well. I didn't stay on in the Navy. But I got out.
03:48:38.12 --> 03:48:43.24 Come over to the desert. Let me host you. Come on over and I'll show you. I'll live.
03:48:43.80 --> 03:48:48.52 It's completely care we had. I got a home up there and an apartment adjacent to it.
03:48:49.24 --> 03:48:56.76 It's full of our son, the doctor and his girlfriend who's a college officer there every weekend with us.
03:48:56.76 --> 03:49:05.96 Life is good. And how I stayed in the Navy had you stayed in the Navy? Who did tell what you
03:49:05.96 --> 03:49:15.72 did? You know what? I found right afterwards it's in here. After 32 years, I found total happiness.
03:49:16.68 --> 03:49:24.28 And between us, we've done it all. We've been all over the world. We've got the home.
03:49:24.28 --> 03:49:36.36 Everything we've done has just been so enjoyable. Well, you know, sir, as I read this book and
03:49:36.36 --> 03:49:43.88 just think about the incredible life that you've lived. And even when you talk about what you've
03:49:43.88 --> 03:49:54.36 done since you left the Navy. And it sounds awesome. But no doubt. I mean, without question, the
03:49:54.36 --> 03:50:02.76 legacy that you left and your bros left in the Navy, in the aviation community, in the military
03:50:02.76 --> 03:50:08.44 to have an attitude to push the envelope, to take risks, to push back when things don't make
03:50:08.44 --> 03:50:21.56 sense that is a legacy that will never die. I know that now. It's been a remarkable day. I've
03:50:21.56 --> 03:50:28.60 done a lot of interviews, maybe a hundred. But I've never done anything I enjoyed more than today.
03:50:28.60 --> 03:50:43.56 You keep in touch with me. Sir, I admire what you're doing. And you know the philosophy and
03:50:43.56 --> 03:50:50.60 what you're building the followers. You can make a lot of money on the outside. I know that
03:50:50.60 --> 03:51:00.60 we've done fine. But you will never. I've got a lot of friends. But you'll never have the quality
03:51:00.60 --> 03:51:07.000 of friendship. You have with the brotherhood. The brotherhood is sales, UDT, guys, a history.
03:51:07.96 --> 03:51:14.92 You won't find those out there. The guy called in there to Godfather that when I got out,
03:51:14.92 --> 03:51:23.64 he kept me going. Not financially, but advice and mentoring. And pray and pray and man.
03:51:24.84 --> 03:51:31.32 Daryl Gary, if you really want to interview some people, interview Daryl Gary, condor.
03:51:32.68 --> 03:51:40.68 I won't get into his personal wealth at his bins. But he and he lives a spiritual Santa Fe.
03:51:40.68 --> 03:51:46.52 That told us. I got to be honest with you. You being here. This is not, I kind of had a sense of what
03:51:46.52 --> 03:51:52.92 there would be like. I was off a lot. This is really, this is really special for me to listen to the
03:51:52.92 --> 03:51:59.48 conversation between you and Jaco. I know Jaco and I know you having never known you. I think the
03:51:59.48 --> 03:52:05.56 way you describe it is everybody knows yank. Look, I was just a bro for three years. And I spent
03:52:05.56 --> 03:52:14.20 most of my time. I've done so much less than I've been given. It's kind of crazy to sit here and listen
03:52:14.20 --> 03:52:19.08 to you tell all these stories about all these places. And I've been to every one of them. I was a
03:52:19.08 --> 03:52:25.24 Marine at Miramar because you guys left in anger to South, took over top Guns Spaces as a Marine.
03:52:26.20 --> 03:52:32.52 I was a training officer at Top Gun. You could buy count on your hands and a Marine that ever
03:52:32.52 --> 03:52:38.76 gotten to do that because I went to an air show at El Toro when I was five. And so now I'm sitting here
03:52:38.76 --> 03:52:44.60 listening and talking about all the things you did and it just adds more to the pile of things that have
03:52:44.60 --> 03:52:49.88 happened to me beyond my control that let me do all these other cool things that by myself I could have
03:52:49.88 --> 03:52:58.44 never ever done. And I have a shred of connection to the legacy to read a book and give it to Jaco.
03:52:58.44 --> 03:53:02.20 Hey man, we might want to do this. I could probably set this thing up and then from the
03:53:02.20 --> 03:53:07.72 outside watch the conversation between two other people and for the first time in my career
03:53:08.52 --> 03:53:14.76 start to recognize how much bigger this thing really is than I ever understood because I lived
03:53:14.76 --> 03:53:18.84 inside of it and I was just working. I didn't know what I was doing. I was just working.
03:53:18.84 --> 03:53:22.20 It's probably just a short of a top Gun and I was just working and then I left and I want to do
03:53:22.20 --> 03:53:29.96 other things. And now I'm sitting here learning more about what I did than I ever knew while I was
03:53:29.96 --> 03:53:37.80 doing it. And it's just another reminder of how much more I have. There's so much how much more I need to
03:53:37.80 --> 03:53:44.36 learn how much less I know than I should. There's the been the best four hours man to sit here and
03:53:44.36 --> 03:53:49.48 watch the legacy you built and to let someone like me get a little touch of what that's like
03:53:50.04 --> 03:53:54.52 to be a part of that has been this has been an awesome awesome. You made it happen you and Jaco
03:53:54.52 --> 03:54:04.52 you sir. Well sir I've had you locked up in here for four hours. When you finish the next book
03:54:05.32 --> 03:54:13.08 A at Mary Beth's recommendation I volunteered to read it I'll do the audio book and I'll do this one
03:54:13.08 --> 03:54:19.24 if you want me to I'm here and when you want anytime you want to come back anytime that any one

03:54:47.08 --> 03:54:57.40 suspecting that perhaps that podcast we would touch on a bunch of things but wouldn't dive too deep
03:54:57.40 --> 03:55:02.92 on certain subjects that got raised in my head so we're gonna actually have to follow up we'll do
03:55:02.92 --> 03:55:09.96 another podcast. Well actually the next podcast Dave if you don't mind I want to drill down on some
03:55:09.96 --> 03:55:19.24 of this stuff because Dan just opens up a whole new world that you know you know and so we'll do
03:55:19.24 --> 03:55:24.76 some deep dive on that on the next one right on us awesome to have awesome to have a guy like that on here
03:55:26.12 --> 03:55:31.88 just an honor to be able to talk to guys like that who spent their life
03:55:31.88 --> 03:55:41.48 trying to get better something we should all probably be doing trying to get better.
03:55:43.48 --> 03:55:50.44 Echo since you agree yes how would you give us some recommendations on how do we get better how to
03:55:50.44 --> 03:55:58.60 stay on the path how to improve on the path all right well jockel few is one way to stay on the path
03:55:58.60 --> 03:56:04.68 all right sometimes we need help we need help on the path so we will turn to jockel feel okay
03:56:04.68 --> 03:56:09.80 what is this supplements joint warfare these for your joints joint warfare superkrill oil
03:56:09.80 --> 03:56:16.36 discipline and discipline go also milk for additional protein in the form of the
03:56:16.36 --> 03:56:21.40 dessert by the way where he keep milk as well for the for the younger ones formulated
03:56:21.40 --> 03:56:26.36 a little bit different more towards you know the younger ones also jockel weight tea this is
03:56:26.36 --> 03:56:33.80 less of a supplement by the way more of every day you know beverage scenario when it gets warm out
03:56:33.80 --> 03:56:41.64 yes sir the cold jockel weight tea is totally legit and it it gives you a little
03:56:42.52 --> 03:56:48.60 little psychological boost and a little physiological boost take them both utilizing both that's what I'm
03:56:48.60 --> 03:56:57.08 thinking I'll all agree with Ellen I know I know Dave Burke yes has been pounding cold war
03:56:59.16 --> 03:57:06.44 every day yeah it's part of my regimen you can smell the garlic it's it's preemptive yeah
03:57:06.44 --> 03:57:11.000 I don't want to react to the war I want to get out in front of that war I'm going to wage war in advance
03:57:11.000 --> 03:57:16.52 like cold war absolutely so I I was my daughter a couple months ago is getting sick
03:57:16.52 --> 03:57:23.32 and I was like hey you know what you take these you know takes some cold war and she says I don't
03:57:23.32 --> 03:57:28.84 like taking she doesn't like taking pills and I go no problem you know what I'll put some and
03:57:28.84 --> 03:57:35.56 I'll break them open put it in the glass stirred up you can just drink it bro you cannot do that
03:57:35.56 --> 03:57:43.72 with cold war you can not do that with cold war it is it was so it smelled so bad it was so offensive
03:57:43.72 --> 03:57:48.44 to drink because I drank it but it was everything in my power to get it down my daughter said
03:57:48.44 --> 03:57:54.92 I my daughter this is my 10 year old daughter you know she said I'm not drinking that I said cool
03:57:55.48 --> 03:57:59.32 I go and I've you know tried to keep them normal face after I drank it was like I just did
03:58:00.36 --> 03:58:09.40 shot a tequila I was like you should have just said that it snaps see so you know
03:58:09.40 --> 03:58:14.60 could it could it convey them but more you know inspiring messages for as the taste oh yeah
03:58:14.60 --> 03:58:19.88 you know actually I don't think it's it snaps by the way there's two things I confirmed with my
03:58:19.88 --> 03:58:27.48 daughters you can say either it snapped or it slaps the way I don't try and get on it I have the
03:58:28.28 --> 03:58:33.80 the the the the individuals that are in the game yeah that was I was I got someone you know
03:58:33.80 --> 03:58:38.68 educated me on it said it was probably it slaps and I kind of recalled a little bit I heard someone
03:58:38.68 --> 03:58:43.88 say it slaps before it was about a song if I'm not mistaken so I'm like okay it slaps
03:58:43.88 --> 03:58:51.32 jock will hurt you wrong it snaps I've never heard it snaps I now to put myself on report my kids
03:58:51.32 --> 03:58:59.64 also say she snapped so maybe I didn't fuse him like if you did a good job on the GJ2
03:58:59.64 --> 03:59:08.12 mats did a good arm lock yeah and yeah oh he snapped okay so maybe I mixed it up I'm 48
