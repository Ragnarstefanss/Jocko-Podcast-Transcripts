00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.56
This is jockel podcast number 184 with echo Charles and me

2
00:00:05.12 --> 00:00:07.84
Jockel willic good evening echo did evening

3
00:00:08.74 --> 00:00:14.56
It's been a while since we've done some Q&A and there's been a lot of questions

4
00:00:14.76 --> 00:00:19.76
So let's get into it ready to go into it. Okay question number one jockel

5
00:00:20.96 --> 00:00:22.64
I'm having issues

6
00:00:22.64 --> 00:00:26.92
Playing the game quote unquote at work. I'm quiet and friendly

7
00:00:26.92 --> 00:00:30.76
But I prefer to work hard rather than stand out in talk

8
00:00:30.76 --> 00:00:36.48
I found I have trouble forming more personal connections with my boss and co-workers

9
00:00:36.68 --> 00:00:38.68
What are your tips?

10
00:00:40.28 --> 00:00:43.16
So look when I talk about playing the game

11
00:00:43.16 --> 00:00:46.08
I'm not talking about the fact that you have to change your entire personality

12
00:00:46.84 --> 00:00:48.12
profile

13
00:00:48.12 --> 00:00:53.56
To start to connect with people that's not what I'm saying you don't have to go from being someone that's

14
00:00:53.56 --> 00:00:58.32
What they say quiet and friendly you don't have to become some chatty extraver

15
00:00:59.44 --> 00:01:02.44
Run it around making small talk with anybody and

16
00:01:03.28 --> 00:01:08.60
On top of that there's a little bit of a statement here that says you know

17
00:01:08.60 --> 00:01:10.60
I'd rather work hard as if

18
00:01:11.48 --> 00:01:14.64
There's these are mutually exclusive things which they are certainly not

19
00:01:15.24 --> 00:01:21.36
So this being forming relationships with people and playing the game does not interfere with your work at all

20
00:01:21.36 --> 00:01:24.88
Not saying that you sit around and talk when there's work to be done

21
00:01:25.84 --> 00:01:27.84
but

22
00:01:27.84 --> 00:01:31.36
There's gonna be natural breaks in whatever you're doing

23
00:01:31.36 --> 00:01:36.72
There's gonna be moments where skip the action pauses and you get a chance to connect with somebody

24
00:01:36.72 --> 00:01:39.52
So that's fine. So so what are some tips?

25
00:01:40.56 --> 00:01:42.56
That how would you do this?

26
00:01:42.72 --> 00:01:44.72
So I thought about this

27
00:01:44.72 --> 00:01:46.08
of

28
00:01:46.08 --> 00:01:47.84
You want to start with something small right?

29
00:01:47.84 --> 00:01:52.96
But you want to engage this is the key point. I don't just want to throw something at you

30
00:01:52.96 --> 00:01:54.96
I don't want to talk at you and besides

31
00:01:56.32 --> 00:01:57.60
when

32
00:01:57.60 --> 00:02:00.64
It's much easier just to let someone talk about themselves

33
00:02:01.36 --> 00:02:06.48
So the what I'm what my advice in this particular question is is to

34
00:02:07.52 --> 00:02:08.88
Tell them

35
00:02:08.88 --> 00:02:11.68
Something about yourself like something minor about yourself

36
00:02:11.92 --> 00:02:15.20
But then that kind of ties into something that you can ask them

37
00:02:15.20 --> 00:02:20.08
And then they can talk to you because most people like to talk about themselves

38
00:02:20.08 --> 00:02:21.84
So you ask them a question about themselves

39
00:02:23.36 --> 00:02:25.04
And then you go so you know something something

40
00:02:26.24 --> 00:02:29.52
Maybe something slightly related to work so it's not just some random

41
00:02:30.16 --> 00:02:34.32
Statement that you're making you know you say you know what we did it?

42
00:02:34.88 --> 00:02:37.68
Yesterday at work you reminded me of

43
00:02:39.44 --> 00:02:42.08
Something right it reminded me of something else and then

44
00:02:42.08 --> 00:02:44.64
Maybe it reminded me of a movie

45
00:02:45.20 --> 00:02:48.24
You know what we were doing yesterday reminding me of this movie have you seen that movie?

46
00:02:49.92 --> 00:02:54.32
And at least you're gonna get well no because I don't watch a lot of movies or no I haven't seen that movie or

47
00:02:55.12 --> 00:02:58.40
Oh, I've seen that movie. We've just a popular movie but you know what I mean?

48
00:02:58.40 --> 00:03:00.56
And all of a sudden you've got a little bit of

49
00:03:01.44 --> 00:03:03.44
Conversation going and that's all we're looking for

50
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.72
We're not looking to turn into like chatty caddy

51
00:03:07.60 --> 00:03:09.60
We're just trying to build

52
00:03:09.60 --> 00:03:13.52
Build relationships with people so you know who they are so they they know who you are

53
00:03:13.92 --> 00:03:17.76
That's what we're talking about now think crazy start small build from there

54
00:03:19.20 --> 00:03:25.04
Pretty straightforward yeah and and through that building process what I kind of found is one

55
00:03:26.08 --> 00:03:30.48
And I guess maybe this is a little tactical thing you can kind of throw out whenever but you know

56
00:03:30.48 --> 00:03:31.68
And you know when people

57
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.20
Give you advice or they tell you something about themself that something I don't know whatever whatever the story is right

58
00:03:37.20 --> 00:03:40.48
And maybe some strategy they use to do XYZ can be super small

59
00:03:41.68 --> 00:03:48.24
If you let them know that you remembered like in the future later on when you see me again you say I remembered what you said

60
00:03:48.80 --> 00:03:52.40
Last week, you know, tired in this yeah and just say you are all the

61
00:03:53.36 --> 00:03:57.68
Can be the smallest of that purple belt to jitsu mental jiu jitsu I like it

62
00:03:58.40 --> 00:04:04.72
It can be the smallest thing and it just makes you feel good so that that person will just

63
00:04:04.72 --> 00:04:08.000
Essentially feel more open with you like oh my gosh

64
00:04:11.60 --> 00:04:16.56
Oh yeah make some feel value ball that stuff just on that small level, you know, so as far as building little

65
00:04:18.16 --> 00:04:23.12
I'd say that's a cool thing to kind of remember to do if he can't I'd say that's a cool kind of thing to remember to

66
00:04:23.52 --> 00:04:25.52
All right, thank you

67
00:04:26.24 --> 00:04:32.88
Next question joko me I asked your advice for addressing a cowboy quote. I'm quote mentality among

68
00:04:32.88 --> 00:04:40.96
Teams working in dangerous environments how would you shift the culture to kill complacency to aggressively identify and mitigate risk

69
00:04:41.76 --> 00:04:43.76
As a point of professional pride

70
00:04:44.72 --> 00:04:46.40
Okay

71
00:04:46.56 --> 00:04:51.84
This is something that we'll definitely saw in the seal team seat all the time in the civilian sector

72
00:04:51.84 --> 00:04:56.08
You know construction companies power companies companies where people are doing dangerous work right

73
00:04:56.08 --> 00:05:03.04
Policeing fire finding anything anything that has any element of danger you you definitely see this and and

74
00:05:03.04 --> 00:05:10.96
Like I said certainly so on the seal teams and the answer to this is a comedy answer for many leadership situations is you have to explain why

75
00:05:11.68 --> 00:05:18.000
So let me put it in a little context what you have to do is you have to say hey let me explain to you what happens

76
00:05:18.64 --> 00:05:24.72
When someone gets hurt or injured on this job. Okay first of all we get the loss of that person on the job

77
00:05:24.72 --> 00:05:28.72
The job that we're working on the project that we're working on it falls back

78
00:05:29.12 --> 00:05:34.000
There's paperwork that has to be filed which by the way the paperwork hurts the progress of our project as well

79
00:05:34.72 --> 00:05:37.68
Our budgets impacted because now we got to bring someone else on board we got to trade him

80
00:05:38.88 --> 00:05:42.24
We we take a reputational hit as a company

81
00:05:43.68 --> 00:05:49.12
Right what what kind of what kind of a company can't do a job without getting someone hurt right

82
00:05:49.12 --> 00:05:57.36
I'm gonna this isn't a high bar it's not a very high bar to say hey can you complete this task without getting someone injured

83
00:05:58.08 --> 00:06:01.20
Yeah, and all of a sudden we got a we got a we got a hey you know in our company

84
00:06:01.28 --> 00:06:04.32
We don't we get a lot of people hurt well. What does that tell you about the company?

85
00:06:04.32 --> 00:06:08.96
It's a reputational hit who are you gonna hire you're not gonna hire the one that's got people getting hurt all the time

86
00:06:09.92 --> 00:06:11.92
So there's that

87
00:06:12.32 --> 00:06:17.76
And what does that do what does that do to your reputation in terms of everything else because if you're gonna

88
00:06:17.76 --> 00:06:23.68
A bunch of people hurt how can I expect you to keep your timelines how can I expect you to stay on budget so

89
00:06:26.56 --> 00:06:30.40
It's those things it's those that kind of reputation that you get

90
00:06:31.28 --> 00:06:33.76
If you are getting people hurt and then also

91
00:06:34.64 --> 00:06:39.36
What does it do what does it say about your team if you got people getting hurt and again?

92
00:06:39.36 --> 00:06:43.12
This is what I'm talking about as a conversation that you're having with the group with the team

93
00:06:43.28 --> 00:06:46.16
You're saying look what kind of a team are we if we got people getting hurt?

94
00:06:46.16 --> 00:06:51.36
What does that say about us? It says where lack lacks of musical it says we're complacent it says we don't pay attention

95
00:06:52.32 --> 00:06:54.08
What does it say about our leadership

96
00:06:54.72 --> 00:06:57.68
If we got guys getting hurt what does that say about our leadership?

97
00:06:57.68 --> 00:07:00.96
Says we don't care about our people which by the way says we don't care about our people

98
00:07:00.96 --> 00:07:02.56
It means says we don't care about our job

99
00:07:02.56 --> 00:07:05.28
It says we don't care about our reputation says we don't we just don't damn care

100
00:07:07.60 --> 00:07:10.000
And what does it say about you the individual?

101
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.28
Well, you know what it says about you an individual.

102
00:07:13.28 --> 00:07:15.24
If you get hurt, you know what it says about you,

103
00:07:15.24 --> 00:07:17.20
you're a knucklehead and you got hurt.

104
00:07:17.20 --> 00:07:18.28
You couldn't follow the procedures.

105
00:07:18.28 --> 00:07:19.40
You didn't follow the procedures.

106
00:07:19.40 --> 00:07:21.68
You thought you were smart and you got complacent.

107
00:07:21.68 --> 00:07:22.48
Now you got hurt.

108
00:07:23.80 --> 00:07:26.24
So these are the things.

109
00:07:26.24 --> 00:07:31.000
When I talk about explaining why those are where I'm gonna start

110
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.32
and now I'm gonna explain and connect the dots

111
00:07:34.32 --> 00:07:36.44
so that the person the individual see

112
00:07:36.44 --> 00:07:42.48
that someone getting hurt is actually the least professional

113
00:07:42.48 --> 00:07:45.40
thing that you can do from a leadership perspective.

114
00:07:45.40 --> 00:07:46.76
If I let one of my guys get hurt,

115
00:07:46.76 --> 00:07:49.72
that's just that's just

116
00:07:49.72 --> 00:07:52.44
the least professional thing I can do from an individual

117
00:07:52.44 --> 00:07:53.76
contributor perspective.

118
00:07:54.84 --> 00:07:56.36
If I'm getting hurt, guess what?

119
00:07:56.36 --> 00:07:58.12
I didn't follow, but you just,

120
00:07:58.12 --> 00:08:00.56
okay, look, are there accidents that happened yesterday?

121
00:08:00.56 --> 00:08:02.88
But what I'm saying is if you got an accident

122
00:08:02.88 --> 00:08:05.08
that could have been prevented that should have been prevented

123
00:08:05.08 --> 00:08:07.68
and I as an individual let it happen,

124
00:08:07.68 --> 00:08:09.28
that is absolutely my fault.

125
00:08:09.28 --> 00:08:11.60
It's like when you got a guy getting ready for an MMA fight

126
00:08:11.60 --> 00:08:15.08
and they get cut, they weren't wearing head gear

127
00:08:15.08 --> 00:08:20.08
and it's like, look, I get it, but that was dumb.

128
00:08:20.08 --> 00:08:21.24
And I've had that happen.

129
00:08:21.24 --> 00:08:23.000
I mean, I've had it happen with my fighters.

130
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.36
I've seen it happen all kinds of happens

131
00:08:24.36 --> 00:08:26.16
and you have to see all the time, right?

132
00:08:26.16 --> 00:08:28.000
You've got to fight coming up.

133
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.20
You're gonna fight for the title.

134
00:08:30.20 --> 00:08:34.32
For the UFC title, you're gonna make possibly millions of dollars.

135
00:08:34.32 --> 00:08:36.32
You're gonna be the champion of the world.

136
00:08:36.32 --> 00:08:40.68
Oh, two weeks out, got a cut, got a cut on my head,

137
00:08:40.68 --> 00:08:43.12
you had a bad, you know, boo out my ACL,

138
00:08:43.12 --> 00:08:45.20
doing take down the fence, right?

139
00:08:46.40 --> 00:08:47.72
Look, I get an accident's happened,

140
00:08:47.72 --> 00:08:49.36
but what was really happening right at that moment?

141
00:08:49.36 --> 00:08:51.24
Was it a random accident or we were doing something

142
00:08:51.24 --> 00:08:53.12
that we shouldn't have been doing?

143
00:08:53.12 --> 00:08:55.88
So if we start to lean towards look,

144
00:08:56.88 --> 00:09:01.88
having accidents is actually an unprofessional thing to do.

145
00:09:01.88 --> 00:09:03.96
It's a weak thing to do.

146
00:09:03.96 --> 00:09:05.40
It's a bad thing to do.

147
00:09:05.40 --> 00:09:07.84
When we let it happen, it hurts everyone,

148
00:09:07.84 --> 00:09:09.44
not just the individual involved.

149
00:09:09.44 --> 00:09:13.08
That's the attitude that we kind of come with.

150
00:09:13.08 --> 00:09:18.08
You know, I had the, in the Navy, you have like alcohol programs.

151
00:09:21.76 --> 00:09:24.48
So, hey, this is our program for, you know,

152
00:09:24.48 --> 00:09:26.64
alcohol, here's how we're trying to combat

153
00:09:26.64 --> 00:09:29.20
having the people have alcohol related incident.

154
00:09:29.20 --> 00:09:31.28
And when I was a trade-it, they had

155
00:09:31.28 --> 00:09:36.28
someone come in to like give us a talk about alcohol.

156
00:09:36.28 --> 00:09:40.28
And then when they got done, the guy says,

157
00:09:40.28 --> 00:09:42.68
okay, you know, sir, I was the guy in charge of you

158
00:09:42.68 --> 00:09:44.84
is what's your alcohol policy?

159
00:09:46.20 --> 00:09:47.16
And I didn't have one.

160
00:09:48.36 --> 00:09:49.36
And I didn't have one.

161
00:09:49.36 --> 00:09:52.28
And I was like, okay, hey, cool, I'll come up with one.

162
00:09:52.28 --> 00:09:54.44
Here's the alcohol policy.

163
00:09:54.44 --> 00:09:58.88
If you get hurt, or sorry, if you get drunk

164
00:09:58.88 --> 00:10:02.08
and you can't, if you get drunk and you get in trouble

165
00:10:02.08 --> 00:10:03.72
or you get in a fight or you get arrested

166
00:10:03.72 --> 00:10:06.08
or you get a DUI and you take time away

167
00:10:06.08 --> 00:10:09.08
from being deployable, you are doing

168
00:10:09.08 --> 00:10:11.64
alchitis job for them.

169
00:10:11.64 --> 00:10:13.32
There's the alcohol policy.

170
00:10:14.72 --> 00:10:16.56
So now, Alvison, it's not like, hey, cool,

171
00:10:16.56 --> 00:10:20.28
we're like, yeah, raw raw.

172
00:10:20.28 --> 00:10:23.44
No, Alvison, hey, man, do we want to help the enemy

173
00:10:23.44 --> 00:10:26.000
by taking ourselves off the battlefield?

174
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.12
There's nothing more that Alchitis wants

175
00:10:28.12 --> 00:10:33.12
than for this seal to be arrested for DUI and non-deployable.

176
00:10:34.24 --> 00:10:36.92
You just did Alchitis job for you.

177
00:10:36.92 --> 00:10:40.64
So that's the kind of thing that I'm gonna build

178
00:10:40.64 --> 00:10:42.04
the culture around.

179
00:10:42.04 --> 00:10:43.64
And that's the same thing you can do with people

180
00:10:43.64 --> 00:10:45.56
that have that cowboy mentality.

181
00:10:45.56 --> 00:10:48.52
You shift it so that that cowboy mentality

182
00:10:48.52 --> 00:10:50.92
becomes the thing that hurts our reputation,

183
00:10:50.92 --> 00:10:53.24
that hurts our, that hurts the company reputation

184
00:10:53.24 --> 00:10:56.64
and it hurts our individual personal reputation.

185
00:10:56.64 --> 00:11:01.64
As a man, I couldn't even prevent my shift

186
00:11:03.20 --> 00:11:05.28
from getting, from having someone get injured.

187
00:11:06.28 --> 00:11:07.40
So that's what I do.

188
00:11:07.40 --> 00:11:10.44
You know, like it feeds into their professional pride,

189
00:11:10.44 --> 00:11:13.88
especially when you use the word unprofessional.

190
00:11:13.88 --> 00:11:14.72
No, yeah.

191
00:11:14.72 --> 00:11:16.88
You know, like a man's to be that, yeah, man,

192
00:11:16.88 --> 00:11:18.88
I knew you knew what you're doing on that one.

193
00:11:18.88 --> 00:11:22.24
And then on the flip side, if you say consummate professional,

194
00:11:22.24 --> 00:11:23.08
right?

195
00:11:23.08 --> 00:11:23.92
Ooh, that's a good one.

196
00:11:23.92 --> 00:11:26.08
If you're, man, you could do,

197
00:11:26.08 --> 00:11:27.64
it doesn't even matter the job.

198
00:11:27.64 --> 00:11:31.68
You can, you can have your own lawn mowing business

199
00:11:31.68 --> 00:11:33.64
when you're 13 years old.

200
00:11:33.64 --> 00:11:35.44
If someone says, hey, that guy,

201
00:11:35.44 --> 00:11:37.000
that kid's a consummate professional,

202
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.64
you're like, hell yeah.

203
00:11:38.64 --> 00:11:39.48
Hell yeah.

204
00:11:39.48 --> 00:11:41.36
I'm gonna have to push back a little bit.

205
00:11:41.36 --> 00:11:43.44
I don't know if there's two people,

206
00:11:43.44 --> 00:11:45.000
I don't know if there's two many situations where you would say

207
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.08
a 13 year old lawn mower.

208
00:11:47.08 --> 00:11:49.80
Now we know that Mark, the way that we're here kid

209
00:11:49.80 --> 00:11:51.20
is heavily involved in lawn mowing

210
00:11:51.20 --> 00:11:52.88
with Mark's meticulous mowing.

211
00:11:52.88 --> 00:11:53.72
Yes, yes, sir.

212
00:11:53.72 --> 00:11:58.72
But even, I don't even know if I'd call him a consummate professional,

213
00:11:58.92 --> 00:12:02.08
I wouldn't either, but if you were to work in the yard,

214
00:12:02.08 --> 00:12:04.40
if you were to do so, Mark would feel really good.

215
00:12:04.40 --> 00:12:06.08
If you said, yes, what I'm saying is you can't be

216
00:12:06.08 --> 00:12:07.28
just throwing words around.

217
00:12:07.28 --> 00:12:08.12
Yeah, that's okay.

218
00:12:08.12 --> 00:12:10.28
You can't just throw around consummate professional

219
00:12:10.28 --> 00:12:12.08
about lawn mowing mowing mowing mowing mowing mowing mowing.

220
00:12:12.08 --> 00:12:15.08
But now let's say the guy was a greenskeeper,

221
00:12:15.08 --> 00:12:16.64
like on a golf course.

222
00:12:16.64 --> 00:12:19.52
Now that person could be a consummate professional,

223
00:12:19.52 --> 00:12:20.96
because he's got to dial stuff.

224
00:12:20.96 --> 00:12:23.44
And then maybe I guess you get to a certain level

225
00:12:23.44 --> 00:12:26.72
of just straight landscaping, where, oh, you know what?

226
00:12:26.72 --> 00:12:29.12
There was a water, there was the pipe exploded.

227
00:12:29.12 --> 00:12:31.12
Oh, Jockel came in.

228
00:12:31.12 --> 00:12:34.08
He had that whole thing resorted, receded,

229
00:12:34.08 --> 00:12:35.16
took him four hours.

230
00:12:35.16 --> 00:12:38.000
That guy is a consummate professional.

231
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.76
So I guess I'll take it back.

232
00:12:39.76 --> 00:12:41.92
Well, I'm just saying, reserve it, reserve it.

233
00:12:41.92 --> 00:12:42.92
Don't play with it, yeah.

234
00:12:42.92 --> 00:12:43.76
Don't play with it.

235
00:12:43.76 --> 00:12:44.80
Fine, that thing around.

236
00:12:44.80 --> 00:12:46.000
Yeah, exactly right.

237
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.36
Makes sense.

238
00:12:47.36 --> 00:12:53.48
Well, the, the draft man that that was very clever

239
00:12:53.48 --> 00:12:54.32
on your part.

240
00:12:54.32 --> 00:12:55.16
What was it?

241
00:12:55.16 --> 00:12:57.24
When you said you're doing okay, does job for you?

242
00:12:57.24 --> 00:12:58.64
Because think about it.

243
00:12:58.64 --> 00:13:01.96
I mean, you know, there's nothing worse for a guy

244
00:13:01.96 --> 00:13:02.72
in the military.

245
00:13:02.72 --> 00:13:05.88
Your personal right is you are actually helping the enemy

246
00:13:05.88 --> 00:13:06.40
right now.

247
00:13:06.40 --> 00:13:07.24
Yeah.

248
00:13:07.24 --> 00:13:09.52
And then how you say it, like you name names, you know?

249
00:13:09.52 --> 00:13:11.12
It's not like you said the enemy, which I get,

250
00:13:11.12 --> 00:13:11.80
that's good too.

251
00:13:11.80 --> 00:13:13.44
But it's way better to be like you're doing

252
00:13:13.44 --> 00:13:16.56
and you name the, because JPU will say that too, right?

253
00:13:16.56 --> 00:13:19.12
Where he'll be like, um, there was a sign or something

254
00:13:19.12 --> 00:13:20.56
about a sign or maybe he'll just say it.

255
00:13:20.56 --> 00:13:22.52
He'll be like, you're, your enemy thinks you for not

256
00:13:22.52 --> 00:13:23.52
giving 100% today.

257
00:13:23.52 --> 00:13:23.72
Yeah.

258
00:13:23.72 --> 00:13:23.84
Right.

259
00:13:23.84 --> 00:13:24.52
Remember that one?

260
00:13:24.52 --> 00:13:25.16
And it's good.

261
00:13:25.16 --> 00:13:25.52
That's a good one.

262
00:13:25.52 --> 00:13:26.64
And it sounds cool too.

263
00:13:26.64 --> 00:13:27.52
I get it.

264
00:13:27.52 --> 00:13:29.40
But it is real general.

265
00:13:29.40 --> 00:13:32.04
So you hear that 10 times or every day or whatever.

266
00:13:32.04 --> 00:13:32.88
Like, okay, cool.

267
00:13:32.88 --> 00:13:35.04
It sounds cool, but it won't really affect your

268
00:13:35.04 --> 00:13:37.32
professional pride all the time.

269
00:13:37.32 --> 00:13:38.48
Sometimes it doesn't.

270
00:13:38.48 --> 00:13:41.16
But if you name the enemy, you know, like if you have

271
00:13:41.16 --> 00:13:44.96
some adversary, you know, and they thank you that person

272
00:13:44.96 --> 00:13:46.52
whatever, John Smith, you know,

273
00:13:46.52 --> 00:13:49.36
for not giving 100, you know, you might feed into you.

274
00:13:49.36 --> 00:13:51.40
So you say in Al Qaeda, thanks you, you know,

275
00:13:51.40 --> 00:13:52.44
for getting arrested.

276
00:13:52.44 --> 00:13:53.48
Some like, amen.

277
00:13:53.48 --> 00:13:55.04
Think about it from the flip side, right?

278
00:13:55.04 --> 00:13:59.60
What if you think of like an Al Qaeda fighting team, right?

279
00:13:59.60 --> 00:14:03.08
And one of them gets cut like one of their effective

280
00:14:03.08 --> 00:14:04.64
fighters gets caught.

281
00:14:04.64 --> 00:14:07.48
I don't know, doing something that they don't like gambling.

282
00:14:07.48 --> 00:14:08.28
Going to strip club.

283
00:14:08.28 --> 00:14:08.64
I don't know.

284
00:14:08.64 --> 00:14:09.40
Whatever.

285
00:14:09.40 --> 00:14:11.36
And they say, hey, you're not allowed to fight anymore

286
00:14:11.36 --> 00:14:12.12
for us.

287
00:14:12.12 --> 00:14:14.36
So he gets like exiled or whatever.

288
00:14:14.36 --> 00:14:17.44
Oh, that's sweet. We want them to do that.

289
00:14:17.44 --> 00:14:20.20
We might have to send them some strip of recommendation.

290
00:14:20.20 --> 00:14:21.24
You see what I'm saying?

291
00:14:21.24 --> 00:14:23.40
So it's literally, he's you're literally doing that.

292
00:14:23.40 --> 00:14:23.56
Yeah.

293
00:14:23.56 --> 00:14:25.28
Literally.

294
00:14:25.28 --> 00:14:26.84
Yeah, that's good.

295
00:14:26.84 --> 00:14:27.48
Jerk.

296
00:14:27.48 --> 00:14:28.48
Jerk.

297
00:14:28.48 --> 00:14:29.36
You clever.

298
00:14:29.36 --> 00:14:29.96
Clever.

299
00:14:29.96 --> 00:14:30.96
Good.

300
00:14:30.96 --> 00:14:31.96
Shh.

301
00:14:31.96 --> 00:14:33.36
Shh.

302
00:14:33.36 --> 00:14:34.44
All right.

303
00:14:34.44 --> 00:14:35.16
Next question.

304
00:14:35.16 --> 00:14:36.44
Hi, Jockel.

305
00:14:36.44 --> 00:14:39.84
You answered a question about complainers and said you would

306
00:14:39.84 --> 00:14:42.80
listen to the because, well, it should be

307
00:14:42.80 --> 00:14:43.80
listen to them.

308
00:14:43.80 --> 00:14:45.72
Yeah. You said you would listen to them because you

309
00:14:45.72 --> 00:14:48.56
can learn what the problems are.

310
00:14:48.56 --> 00:14:49.16
I like it.

311
00:14:49.16 --> 00:14:50.48
And people like to be heard.

312
00:14:50.48 --> 00:14:53.84
But how do you handle chronic complainers?

313
00:14:53.84 --> 00:14:55.92
The type of people who become cancerous,

314
00:14:55.92 --> 00:14:58.32
a meat fanics of extreme ownership should take.

315
00:14:58.32 --> 00:15:00.48
Thanks for your time.

316
00:15:00.48 --> 00:15:04.56
Yeah, this is a cause once again for my favorite.

317
00:15:04.56 --> 00:15:09.04
My favorite general remedy in leadership situations

318
00:15:09.04 --> 00:15:11.68
is you take this person and you put him in charge.

319
00:15:11.68 --> 00:15:12.40
Put him in charge?

320
00:15:12.40 --> 00:15:13.40
Yeah.

321
00:15:13.40 --> 00:15:15.84
And this is one of those classic things where someone says,

322
00:15:15.84 --> 00:15:18.44
hey, why are we even doing it this way?

323
00:15:18.44 --> 00:15:20.24
And you say, oh, echo, you don't like that cool.

324
00:15:20.24 --> 00:15:21.96
Why don't you come up with a plan and you go execute it?

325
00:15:21.96 --> 00:15:23.68
How do you want?

326
00:15:23.68 --> 00:15:24.68
Yeah.

327
00:15:24.68 --> 00:15:28.72
And that does one or two things either they say, OK.

328
00:15:28.72 --> 00:15:30.96
And they step up and then they have to figure out how hard the

329
00:15:30.96 --> 00:15:33.32
job the task is and they have to get it done.

330
00:15:33.32 --> 00:15:36.44
And it's they learn from it and they get humbled by it.

331
00:15:36.44 --> 00:15:41.04
And they recognize the the the burden of responsibility that

332
00:15:41.04 --> 00:15:45.08
a leader actually has, which is all good or they just say, no, no,

333
00:15:45.08 --> 00:15:46.64
and they stop playing because they don't want to get

334
00:15:46.64 --> 00:15:47.64
tested.

335
00:15:47.64 --> 00:15:50.08
Now, what what you got to be careful with it,

336
00:15:50.08 --> 00:15:58.08
all these answers that I give, you could go like in the wrong direction.

337
00:15:58.08 --> 00:16:01.60
So what I mean by that is echo says, hey, I don't like

338
00:16:01.60 --> 00:16:02.92
we're doing the way we're doing this.

339
00:16:02.92 --> 00:16:04.92
And I go, OK, well, then you're in charge.

340
00:16:04.92 --> 00:16:05.92
Yeah.

341
00:16:05.92 --> 00:16:06.92
You know what I mean?

342
00:16:06.92 --> 00:16:07.92
I do it like that.

343
00:16:07.92 --> 00:16:08.92
It's a punishment.

344
00:16:08.92 --> 00:16:09.92
It's a punitive thing.

345
00:16:09.92 --> 00:16:11.88
And absolutely not what I'm talking about.

346
00:16:11.88 --> 00:16:13.12
I say, you know what echo?

347
00:16:13.12 --> 00:16:14.28
You're pointing out some good stuff.

348
00:16:14.28 --> 00:16:18.12
You're pointing out some definite shortfalls in the way that this is happening.

349
00:16:18.12 --> 00:16:21.28
I'll tell you what, why don't you actually just take responsibility for this

350
00:16:21.28 --> 00:16:23.48
and you can run this task and you can make this happen.

351
00:16:23.48 --> 00:16:26.84
Because I think, you know, just based on some of the things you've pointed

352
00:16:26.84 --> 00:16:28.68
out already, I mean, call them complaints.

353
00:16:28.68 --> 00:16:30.92
Based on some of the things you pointed out already, I think you could

354
00:16:30.92 --> 00:16:34.04
probably improve upon our process quite a bit.

355
00:16:34.04 --> 00:16:35.24
So you got to be careful.

356
00:16:35.24 --> 00:16:38.000
I'm not talking about being a jerk to someone.

357
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:38.68
Yeah.

358
00:16:38.68 --> 00:16:40.000
I'm talking about action.

359
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And this is the thing.

360
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.44
It's like there's this thing.

361
00:16:45.44 --> 00:16:49.000
Well, what I'm doing, I'm not just playing the game.

362
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.60
Have I ever told this in GJJ?

363
00:16:50.60 --> 00:16:56.28
I'm like, hey, if you want to set me up with the choke so that you can get my arm,

364
00:16:56.28 --> 00:16:58.68
you have to actually do the choke.

365
00:16:58.68 --> 00:17:00.04
You have to actually apply the pressure.

366
00:17:00.04 --> 00:17:01.44
If you know to apply the pressure, I'm not defending it.

367
00:17:01.44 --> 00:17:02.88
My arm's not going to go where you want it.

368
00:17:02.88 --> 00:17:04.44
You have to actually do it.

369
00:17:04.44 --> 00:17:08.24
And if I don't defend it the way you expect me to, then you just choke me.

370
00:17:08.24 --> 00:17:09.24
It's the same thing here.

371
00:17:09.24 --> 00:17:11.92
I'm not saying you just say, well, what don't you do with that?

372
00:17:11.92 --> 00:17:16.80
No, you have to actually say, hey, listen, I think this is what's going on.

373
00:17:16.80 --> 00:17:18.56
I think you have some good points.

374
00:17:18.56 --> 00:17:23.000
Why don't you take lead on this and we'll see if you can remedy this situation.

375
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.16
Because I think you've got a pretty good chance of doing it.

376
00:17:25.16 --> 00:17:27.16
This isn't, I'm not doing this as a punitive thing.

377
00:17:27.16 --> 00:17:29.20
I'm doing it because it's the best thing for the team.

378
00:17:29.20 --> 00:17:30.56
You've got a legitimate complaint.

379
00:17:30.56 --> 00:17:32.20
You've got a bunch of them.

380
00:17:32.20 --> 00:17:36.72
Let's get you in a position where you can sort some of those things out.

381
00:17:36.72 --> 00:17:40.000
So yeah, so that's that.

382
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.76
We can get people that are complaining, you know, first of all, hear them out.

383
00:17:43.76 --> 00:17:45.68
And maybe that's good enough, right?

384
00:17:45.68 --> 00:17:47.48
Hey, listen to them.

385
00:17:47.48 --> 00:17:51.32
And once again, I'm not saying you listen to them while your brain is elsewhere and you're

386
00:17:51.32 --> 00:17:53.44
not thinking, are you actually listening what they're saying?

387
00:17:53.44 --> 00:17:54.44
You're engaged.

388
00:17:54.44 --> 00:17:56.68
You really do go for the choke.

389
00:17:56.68 --> 00:17:57.68
Go for it.

390
00:17:57.68 --> 00:17:58.68
Listen to what they're saying.

391
00:17:58.68 --> 00:18:00.80
Maybe there's some solutions you can come up with.

392
00:18:00.80 --> 00:18:03.96
But then if that doesn't work and even after they even after you listen to them and

393
00:18:03.96 --> 00:18:07.36
you explain to them why things aren't the way they want, they still want to complain

394
00:18:07.36 --> 00:18:08.36
it.

395
00:18:08.36 --> 00:18:09.36
Complain about it.

396
00:18:09.36 --> 00:18:10.36
Cool.

397
00:18:10.36 --> 00:18:11.36
That's fine.

398
00:18:11.36 --> 00:18:12.36
Awesome.

399
00:18:12.36 --> 00:18:13.36
You take lead on this and that way you can sort out some of these issues.

400
00:18:13.36 --> 00:18:14.36
Appreciate it.

401
00:18:14.36 --> 00:18:18.08
Kind of like Leipzig, that one time is kind of hard to complain about a plan when it's

402
00:18:18.08 --> 00:18:19.08
your plan.

403
00:18:19.08 --> 00:18:20.36
Yeah, that is the truth.

404
00:18:20.36 --> 00:18:21.36
Yeah, makes sense.

405
00:18:21.36 --> 00:18:23.36
God, I'm so stupid.

406
00:18:23.36 --> 00:18:27.56
Yeah, let's get in sucks that I came up with.

407
00:18:27.56 --> 00:18:37.92
Yeah, the chronic complaining because you could kind of, I mean, people complain a lot.

408
00:18:37.92 --> 00:18:41.12
It's easy to be like, oh, they're chronic complainers.

409
00:18:41.12 --> 00:18:46.68
But if there's constantly, we'll say chronic problems that might induce chronic complaining.

410
00:18:46.68 --> 00:18:47.84
I'm not saying that's the case.

411
00:18:47.84 --> 00:18:49.84
Obviously because I know that there is.

412
00:18:49.84 --> 00:18:53.36
So it's doing this chronic complainers 100%.

413
00:18:53.36 --> 00:18:56.80
But at the very least, like I say, oh, yeah, I put them in charge of something or

414
00:18:56.80 --> 00:19:00.76
listen to them and they'll point, listen to what they're complaining about or whatever.

415
00:19:00.76 --> 00:19:05.32
You might actually get turned on to all these solvable problems.

416
00:19:05.32 --> 00:19:12.36
And if you make someone take lead in a situation and it's kind of like that concept of

417
00:19:12.36 --> 00:19:16.80
taking an extreme ownership and then what if they do like say, yeah, it is your fault.

418
00:19:16.80 --> 00:19:17.80
And then you get all mad.

419
00:19:17.80 --> 00:19:20.32
You know, kind of thing is like, oh, you didn't really do that.

420
00:19:20.32 --> 00:19:23.56
It's like, so if you put someone else in charge of something, you're really putting

421
00:19:23.56 --> 00:19:24.56
them in charge.

422
00:19:24.56 --> 00:19:27.28
But if they run, what if they take lead and they solve all the problems?

423
00:19:27.28 --> 00:19:28.28
And they don't awesome, right?

424
00:19:28.28 --> 00:19:29.28
Yeah, exactly.

425
00:19:29.28 --> 00:19:34.88
So you don't treat this action or this discourse as like something to get back at the

426
00:19:34.88 --> 00:19:35.88
complaint.

427
00:19:35.88 --> 00:19:36.88
It's not just a setup.

428
00:19:36.88 --> 00:19:37.88
It's a real move.

429
00:19:37.88 --> 00:19:39.12
It's a real deal.

430
00:19:39.12 --> 00:19:50.36
And you know, that's, you just made this point that I made, which is one of the best leadership

431
00:19:50.36 --> 00:19:53.84
tools that is completely overlooked by people all the time.

432
00:19:53.84 --> 00:19:55.76
This is very, very simple to do.

433
00:19:55.76 --> 00:19:59.000
And that's just to listen to what people are saying.

434
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.28
I know it sounds crazy, but I run into all the time, leaders in all kinds of levels,

435
00:20:04.28 --> 00:20:05.64
all kinds of situations.

436
00:20:05.64 --> 00:20:08.12
And the biggest problem they have is they don't even listen to anyone else.

437
00:20:08.12 --> 00:20:09.76
They won't listen.

438
00:20:09.76 --> 00:20:10.92
Yeah.

439
00:20:10.92 --> 00:20:14.24
So when you're in a leadership position, try this.

440
00:20:14.24 --> 00:20:16.52
Be quiet and listen to what people are saying.

441
00:20:16.52 --> 00:20:18.52
Listen to what they're complaining about.

442
00:20:18.52 --> 00:20:20.72
Listen to what suggestions they have.

443
00:20:20.72 --> 00:20:22.52
Listen to what advice they give.

444
00:20:22.52 --> 00:20:24.04
Listen to their recommendations.

445
00:20:24.04 --> 00:20:27.32
Listen, just listen sometimes.

446
00:20:27.32 --> 00:20:29.000
You're going to be in a much better spot.

447
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Yeah.

448
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.88
And even like you saying that out loud sounds real obvious, you know?

449
00:20:32.88 --> 00:20:34.20
But it's, man, it's not.

450
00:20:34.20 --> 00:20:37.20
Because even a lot of times, like if you don't listen, I'm thinking of myself, like all

451
00:20:37.20 --> 00:20:44.04
the many trillions, trillions of times that I haven't listened when I should have.

452
00:20:44.04 --> 00:20:48.52
Most of the time, most of the time we'll say, I don't mean to not listen.

453
00:20:48.52 --> 00:20:53.44
I don't mean to be like, it's not like I'm hearing noise and be like, oh, you don't

454
00:20:53.44 --> 00:20:54.44
know what you're talking about.

455
00:20:54.44 --> 00:20:55.44
You're dumb.

456
00:20:55.44 --> 00:20:56.72
You know, what you say doesn't mean anything.

457
00:20:56.72 --> 00:20:57.72
It's not that.

458
00:20:57.72 --> 00:21:02.92
It's more that I'm like, focus so hard on what I'm thinking or my way or whatever.

459
00:21:02.92 --> 00:21:06.24
Like I'm just so just, of course, naturally, it's my kind of thinking about it for years.

460
00:21:06.24 --> 00:21:07.24
No, you know, kind of thing.

461
00:21:07.24 --> 00:21:12.28
So I'm so, basically, dug into myself on my own thing that I'm not.

462
00:21:12.28 --> 00:21:14.88
And I'm just not paying attention that much.

463
00:21:14.88 --> 00:21:19.80
You know, I'm like working so hard and down this tunnel that I can't look out of the

464
00:21:19.80 --> 00:21:21.60
tunnel kind of thing.

465
00:21:21.60 --> 00:21:25.72
So you don't really mean to, but when you're in the situation, it's like, it's not that

466
00:21:25.72 --> 00:21:26.72
easy.

467
00:21:26.72 --> 00:21:30.80
It's, and you know what it is, also, it's a detachment.

468
00:21:30.80 --> 00:21:31.80
Right?

469
00:21:31.80 --> 00:21:33.24
Because when you're talking, you're talking.

470
00:21:33.24 --> 00:21:34.24
Yeah.

471
00:21:34.24 --> 00:21:35.24
And I've got to step back to touch.

472
00:21:35.24 --> 00:21:36.24
Listen to what people are saying.

473
00:21:36.24 --> 00:21:37.24
I do this all the time.

474
00:21:37.24 --> 00:21:38.96
I do this all the time.

475
00:21:38.96 --> 00:21:41.52
It's such a, it's such an easy move.

476
00:21:41.52 --> 00:21:42.52
Yeah.

477
00:21:42.52 --> 00:21:44.84
If you remember, move, you just watch.

478
00:21:44.84 --> 00:21:47.20
You just listen, even like, can you just do you do this?

479
00:21:47.20 --> 00:21:48.92
You're like, oh, the person wants to move around a bunch.

480
00:21:48.92 --> 00:21:49.92
Cool.

481
00:21:49.92 --> 00:21:50.92
Let him move around a bunch.

482
00:21:50.92 --> 00:21:51.92
Let's see where they're going.

483
00:21:51.92 --> 00:21:52.92
I'm just going to listen to their moves.

484
00:21:52.92 --> 00:21:54.92
And that's a good way to put it, man.

485
00:21:54.92 --> 00:21:56.56
Just listen to their moves.

486
00:21:56.56 --> 00:21:57.56
Just listen.

487
00:21:57.56 --> 00:22:02.000
And yeah, if you primarily focus on that listening, then like you have to be able to do it

488
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
way better.

489
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.20
Because like, again, like back to the, it's not like, you're not doing it with malicious intent.

490
00:22:08.20 --> 00:22:10.32
You know, you're not shutting them down.

491
00:22:10.32 --> 00:22:12.48
It's almost like every, you like, interruptors, right?

492
00:22:12.48 --> 00:22:13.48
You know, chronic interruptors.

493
00:22:13.48 --> 00:22:14.48
Yes.

494
00:22:14.48 --> 00:22:17.08
So the time, some of the time, a lot of time, whatever.

495
00:22:17.08 --> 00:22:19.84
We'll say half of the time estimate there.

496
00:22:19.84 --> 00:22:22.56
It doesn't feel like they're doing it because they don't want to hear what you have to

497
00:22:22.56 --> 00:22:23.56
say.

498
00:22:23.56 --> 00:22:24.56
Sometimes it's that for sure.

499
00:22:24.56 --> 00:22:28.40
But sometimes, it's almost like, it's almost like they have this tone of like

500
00:22:28.40 --> 00:22:29.40
dang.

501
00:22:29.40 --> 00:22:33.40
I don't think I finished my point as good as I wanted to almost it's doing it for them for

502
00:22:33.40 --> 00:22:34.40
them for themselves.

503
00:22:34.40 --> 00:22:36.44
Because they're so committed to their message and what they've been thinking

504
00:22:36.44 --> 00:22:37.44
the whole time.

505
00:22:37.44 --> 00:22:41.84
And if you're not signing right onto it, it's man, I must not set it clear enough.

506
00:22:41.84 --> 00:22:44.44
You see, I'm saying I had to like tighten up my kid.

507
00:22:44.44 --> 00:22:46.52
It's on just straight.

508
00:22:46.52 --> 00:22:48.12
They just wouldn't let each other talk.

509
00:22:48.12 --> 00:22:50.12
It just interrupt interrupt interrupt.

510
00:22:50.12 --> 00:22:51.12
Yeah.

511
00:22:51.12 --> 00:22:53.60
I think it was, yeah, it was my son for sure.

512
00:22:53.60 --> 00:22:57.72
And he looked at me and he goes, he's like, he says, Dad, you and he just be a

513
00:22:57.72 --> 00:22:58.72
aggressive or whole wife.

514
00:22:58.72 --> 00:23:00.96
And now all of a sudden you're telling us just a sit back.

515
00:23:00.96 --> 00:23:04.96
That was funny.

516
00:23:04.96 --> 00:23:06.52
Did you tell him that that's the day economy?

517
00:23:06.52 --> 00:23:07.52
I said that's the day economy.

518
00:23:07.52 --> 00:23:08.52
I know he's gross.

519
00:23:08.52 --> 00:23:09.52
Yeah.

520
00:23:09.52 --> 00:23:10.52
All right.

521
00:23:10.52 --> 00:23:11.52
Next question.

522
00:23:11.52 --> 00:23:14.96
What is the most important issue?

523
00:23:14.96 --> 00:23:21.44
You've ever changed your mind about.

524
00:23:21.44 --> 00:23:26.48
This is, you know, this is one of those things where I'm, this is one of those questions

525
00:23:26.48 --> 00:23:33.92
where I should have like some answer about some specific subject or something.

526
00:23:33.92 --> 00:23:34.92
You know what I mean?

527
00:23:34.92 --> 00:23:37.96
Like I can see, I know what answer is desired.

528
00:23:37.96 --> 00:23:39.60
I know what type of answers is desired.

529
00:23:39.60 --> 00:23:48.52
But the reality is, you know, for me, to taking ownership of things, right?

530
00:23:48.52 --> 00:23:54.80
This wasn't really like I changed my mind to where, when I used to say, I'm going to blame

531
00:23:54.80 --> 00:23:56.24
everyone and then all of a sudden, you know what?

532
00:23:56.24 --> 00:23:57.60
That's not the right policy to have.

533
00:23:57.60 --> 00:23:59.60
I need to start to extreme ownership.

534
00:23:59.60 --> 00:24:01.32
I didn't do that.

535
00:24:01.32 --> 00:24:06.88
But it was just a thing that built and developed inside my brain.

536
00:24:06.88 --> 00:24:13.16
And I think it's the most important thing that I've ever sort of recognized or conclusion

537
00:24:13.16 --> 00:24:14.16
that I've come to.

538
00:24:14.16 --> 00:24:15.48
That's not a change.

539
00:24:15.48 --> 00:24:20.64
But I'm sure at some point my attitude wasn't like I'll just take ownership of that.

540
00:24:20.64 --> 00:24:21.64
Which is now.

541
00:24:21.64 --> 00:24:23.76
But at some point, you know, I'd say, well, that's not really my responsibility.

542
00:24:23.76 --> 00:24:24.76
You know what I mean?

543
00:24:24.76 --> 00:24:25.76
Of course.

544
00:24:25.76 --> 00:24:28.08
No, that's a natural thing to say.

545
00:24:28.08 --> 00:24:32.76
And I'll tell you, well, the next, and this is interesting.

546
00:24:32.76 --> 00:24:38.56
But the other, and this one's kind of more of a, more of a, I can pin it down a little

547
00:24:38.56 --> 00:24:40.60
bit closer to an answer that someone would like.

548
00:24:40.60 --> 00:24:46.16
And this is, again, it's going to be a little bit, a little bit strange.

549
00:24:46.16 --> 00:24:50.28
But the other thing is the dichotomy of leadership.

550
00:24:50.28 --> 00:24:53.000
And this is the thing about the dichotomy of leadership.

551
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.12
And I actually was thinking, I actually didn't really recognize this until the last

552
00:24:57.12 --> 00:24:58.12
master.

553
00:24:58.12 --> 00:25:01.72
I know, as I was thinking about the dichotomy of leadership, maybe it was off of a question.

554
00:25:01.72 --> 00:25:04.32
Maybe, I think it was actually before, no actually was before we even started.

555
00:25:04.32 --> 00:25:09.48
I was just like reviewing notes and thinking about the dichotomy of leadership.

556
00:25:09.48 --> 00:25:18.88
And one of the most important things about the dichotomy of leadership is that the reason,

557
00:25:18.88 --> 00:25:22.72
the reason that I came to the conclusion, the reason that I got to the dichotomy of

558
00:25:22.72 --> 00:25:24.44
leadership, we're in getting there.

559
00:25:24.44 --> 00:25:25.44
Let me rephrase that.

560
00:25:25.44 --> 00:25:30.44
In getting to a point where I said, there's a dichotomy of leadership, what I had to do

561
00:25:30.44 --> 00:25:36.96
was I had to admit to myself that I was wrong about everything.

562
00:25:36.96 --> 00:25:39.08
That's what I had to do.

563
00:25:39.08 --> 00:25:46.40
In order for the idea of the dichotomy of leadership to escape my brain, to get out,

564
00:25:46.40 --> 00:25:49.000
to become a full thought.

565
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.04
What I had to do, I had to admit to myself that I was actually wrong about everything.

566
00:25:56.04 --> 00:26:00.80
So I'll give you real easy examples, one of my things that I used to tell guys all the

567
00:26:00.80 --> 00:26:01.80
time.

568
00:26:01.80 --> 00:26:05.20
You got to be aggressive.

569
00:26:05.20 --> 00:26:06.20
You got to be aggressive.

570
00:26:06.20 --> 00:26:07.92
That's how you got to be.

571
00:26:07.92 --> 00:26:11.08
In order for the dichotomy of leadership, I had to admit, you know what, sometimes being

572
00:26:11.08 --> 00:26:12.68
aggressive doesn't work.

573
00:26:12.68 --> 00:26:17.56
I used to say, you know what, as a leader, you got to stand up, you got to be loud.

574
00:26:17.56 --> 00:26:21.48
And then I realized you know what, there's I see leaders that are two.

575
00:26:21.48 --> 00:26:23.52
I didn't admit that I was wrong about that.

576
00:26:23.52 --> 00:26:25.32
That's sometimes that was wrong.

577
00:26:25.32 --> 00:26:30.36
I had to admit that I was wrong about keeping things simple.

578
00:26:30.36 --> 00:26:33.08
Like you know what, this is one of the most fundamental laws of combat.

579
00:26:33.08 --> 00:26:34.56
You got to keep things simple.

580
00:26:34.56 --> 00:26:40.20
And then I had to admit that sometimes people keep things too simple.

581
00:26:40.20 --> 00:26:42.32
Even this fact right here, right?

582
00:26:42.32 --> 00:26:45.48
In order to admit that I was wrong, I had to be humble.

583
00:26:45.48 --> 00:26:46.48
And I used to preach.

584
00:26:46.48 --> 00:26:49.16
And I still preach humility as being like the most important thing.

585
00:26:49.16 --> 00:26:50.16
But guess what?

586
00:26:50.16 --> 00:26:52.16
There are people.

587
00:26:52.16 --> 00:27:00.20
And there are even me with this, there's times and places where you can be too humble.

588
00:27:00.20 --> 00:27:06.76
And so this idea, this idea that there's dichotomy to everything, it's something that

589
00:27:06.76 --> 00:27:15.60
the original thought for me was, it came from me having one sided opinion and then realizing

590
00:27:15.60 --> 00:27:17.32
that, and I'm almost positive.

591
00:27:17.32 --> 00:27:22.36
I don't remember crystal clear, but I'm almost positive that the original thought that

592
00:27:22.36 --> 00:27:27.40
I realized there was a dichotomy to was being aggressive.

593
00:27:27.40 --> 00:27:32.84
And again, this was, this is all kind of coming to fruition as I'm teaching guys at

594
00:27:32.84 --> 00:27:37.28
trade at and life was running the junior officer training course.

595
00:27:37.28 --> 00:27:38.64
And I used to give them the soul.

596
00:27:38.64 --> 00:27:41.76
And I remember right and you know, I remember to say to myself, you know what, I got to tell

597
00:27:41.76 --> 00:27:48.32
guys that they can go too far with being aggressive and they can go too far with barking

598
00:27:48.32 --> 00:27:52.88
orders and they, and I just, it like that's where it came from.

599
00:27:52.88 --> 00:27:58.16
And if I wouldn't have been able to change my mind, right, because that's what this question

600
00:27:58.16 --> 00:28:00.80
was, changing my mind about something.

601
00:28:00.80 --> 00:28:07.76
The biggest thing probably ever in my life was understanding that just about every characteristic

602
00:28:07.76 --> 00:28:12.80
that a person can have, that a leader can have, can go too far and can become a negative

603
00:28:12.80 --> 00:28:14.80
characteristic.

604
00:28:14.80 --> 00:28:18.80
So that's probably the biggest thing that I've changed my mind on.

605
00:28:18.80 --> 00:28:20.80
Interesting.

606
00:28:20.80 --> 00:28:26.24
Yeah, that aggressive one that makes sense, because like, yeah, aggressive being aggressive

607
00:28:26.24 --> 00:28:30.68
like is one of the more effective ways to straight up, going to quote, get things done.

608
00:28:30.68 --> 00:28:31.68
First, right?

609
00:28:31.68 --> 00:28:32.68
Do it and it'll be done.

610
00:28:32.68 --> 00:28:33.68
Do it, you know.

611
00:28:33.68 --> 00:28:34.68
Don't wait.

612
00:28:34.68 --> 00:28:35.68
Don't hesitate.

613
00:28:35.68 --> 00:28:36.68
Yeah, yeah.

614
00:28:36.68 --> 00:28:40.92
Problem in a building, let's sit back and wait until that problem starts to know.

615
00:28:40.92 --> 00:28:42.20
Like you got to be aggressive.

616
00:28:42.20 --> 00:28:43.44
Yeah.

617
00:28:43.44 --> 00:28:47.56
But then if you're in judicial teaching, all kinds of lessons like this where if you're

618
00:28:47.56 --> 00:28:52.68
going to spring a trap on somebody or something, animal, person, whatever.

619
00:28:52.68 --> 00:28:56.88
What's the best type of person that you can catch with a trap?

620
00:28:56.88 --> 00:28:59.08
Probably an aggressive one, you know.

621
00:28:59.08 --> 00:29:04.64
Like they can set themselves up to get trapped if they're like aggressive.

622
00:29:04.64 --> 00:29:09.52
You know, like an animal who's wrong, you know.

623
00:29:09.52 --> 00:29:13.12
He's detaining like if an animal's like hesitant, you know.

624
00:29:13.12 --> 00:29:17.28
Just hesitant maybe sees things develop a little bit before they take a grab, you know,

625
00:29:17.28 --> 00:29:19.64
certain action or whatever, it'd be hard to detrap.

626
00:29:19.64 --> 00:29:20.64
Yeah.

627
00:29:20.64 --> 00:29:21.64
Yeah.

628
00:29:21.64 --> 00:29:28.56
And this is the thing that's, this is what makes humility important.

629
00:29:28.56 --> 00:29:34.40
It's hard to come to grips with the dichotomy of leadership because if you don't have

630
00:29:34.40 --> 00:29:38.12
the humility, do sometimes say, you know what, you're right.

631
00:29:38.12 --> 00:29:39.68
You know what, I'm wrong.

632
00:29:39.68 --> 00:29:40.68
Yeah.

633
00:29:40.68 --> 00:29:43.56
This plan isn't what I thought it should be.

634
00:29:43.56 --> 00:29:44.56
Yeah.

635
00:29:44.56 --> 00:29:45.56
It's so hard to do that.

636
00:29:45.56 --> 00:29:48.16
That's why it's hard to really get a grip on the dichotomy.

637
00:29:48.16 --> 00:29:49.56
Leadership and that's what makes it so important.

638
00:29:49.56 --> 00:29:52.96
That's what makes it the answer to so many questions.

639
00:29:52.96 --> 00:29:56.56
And sometimes people will come like, you know, someone will come up and say, they'll

640
00:29:56.56 --> 00:30:01.56
have their counterpoint to what I'm saying.

641
00:30:01.56 --> 00:30:07.20
And I'll tell you right now, let me think of a situation where you have to provide a

642
00:30:07.20 --> 00:30:08.20
counterpoint.

643
00:30:08.20 --> 00:30:12.80
If I, somebody comes to me and says, you know what, being aggressive isn't always

644
00:30:12.80 --> 00:30:13.80
good.

645
00:30:13.80 --> 00:30:18.08
Sometimes if you're aggressive, all you do is you run to your death.

646
00:30:18.08 --> 00:30:25.88
Now, an egotistical jacco would say negative, you're wrong.

647
00:30:25.88 --> 00:30:26.88
I'm right.

648
00:30:26.88 --> 00:30:30.000
And I would dig in in that position.

649
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.60
And when you dig in and position, you can't maneuver anymore.

650
00:30:32.60 --> 00:30:34.48
So I'm actually stuck.

651
00:30:34.48 --> 00:30:37.36
So this is a classic thing to do.

652
00:30:37.36 --> 00:30:42.36
Also when I'm arguing with somebody, if you come to me and you say, I think we should

653
00:30:42.36 --> 00:30:45.48
do this, you know, method B.

654
00:30:45.48 --> 00:30:48.84
I say, I don't say no, because I think we should do a method A.

655
00:30:48.84 --> 00:30:49.84
That's what I think.

656
00:30:49.84 --> 00:30:50.68
And you think we should do a method B.

657
00:30:50.68 --> 00:30:51.96
You're going to be, I think we should do this method B.

658
00:30:51.96 --> 00:30:52.96
I think you're wrong.

659
00:30:52.96 --> 00:30:53.96
You know what I say?

660
00:30:53.96 --> 00:30:54.96
Okay.

661
00:30:54.96 --> 00:30:57.96
Well, I think you got some good points on method B.

662
00:30:57.96 --> 00:31:02.72
Oh, all of a sudden, you know, all of a sudden, we're in a totally different scenario.

663
00:31:02.72 --> 00:31:06.32
I just totally flipped the script on you.

664
00:31:06.32 --> 00:31:07.32
And I, you know what I say?

665
00:31:07.32 --> 00:31:10.08
I say, you know, some good points that you have.

666
00:31:10.08 --> 00:31:16.24
If you watch people debate, it's really a little slick move.

667
00:31:16.24 --> 00:31:20.04
But you don't see politicians do it, because they're so dug in, they can never think

668
00:31:20.04 --> 00:31:21.32
they're wrong.

669
00:31:21.32 --> 00:31:24.72
And they can never, and what they also are afraid of, they're afraid if they admit

670
00:31:24.72 --> 00:31:26.16
they're wrong about something.

671
00:31:26.16 --> 00:31:28.76
They look bad.

672
00:31:28.76 --> 00:31:29.84
Whereas if they said, you know what?

673
00:31:29.84 --> 00:31:31.20
That's a good point.

674
00:31:31.20 --> 00:31:32.20
That's actually a good point.

675
00:31:32.20 --> 00:31:33.20
I'm going to need to consider that.

676
00:31:33.20 --> 00:31:35.52
I've never really thought of that viewpoint before.

677
00:31:35.52 --> 00:31:36.52
You know what?

678
00:31:36.52 --> 00:31:37.84
I'm going to assess that.

679
00:31:37.84 --> 00:31:40.76
But I guess I think you got, I think there's some validity to what you just said.

680
00:31:40.76 --> 00:31:42.80
When's the last time you heard a politician say that?

681
00:31:42.80 --> 00:31:44.44
I don't, I don't think that.

682
00:31:44.44 --> 00:31:52.60
And then what happens is, and in this day and age, the supporters of that politician, they don't,

683
00:31:52.60 --> 00:31:55.08
they don't recognize the valid point either.

684
00:31:55.08 --> 00:31:57.52
It's just, no.

685
00:31:57.52 --> 00:31:58.52
No.

686
00:31:58.52 --> 00:32:05.16
So we get people that aren't thinking and it's very hard to hold dichotomies in your head

687
00:32:05.16 --> 00:32:07.08
that this can be right and that can be right.

688
00:32:07.08 --> 00:32:09.32
There's an aggressive approach and there's an on aggressive approach.

689
00:32:09.32 --> 00:32:14.000
There's an direct approach and there's an indirect approach and both of them can be functional.

690
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.44
It's really hard to get a grip on that.

691
00:32:17.44 --> 00:32:20.12
And yet it's the answer to so many questions.

692
00:32:20.12 --> 00:32:24.68
It's the answer to the person, the subordinate that comes to you.

693
00:32:24.68 --> 00:32:28.84
And says, we should not be doing it this way.

694
00:32:28.84 --> 00:32:34.20
If your reaction isn't to diametrically opposed what they're saying, but instead to actually

695
00:32:34.20 --> 00:32:36.64
take their side and say, oh, I agree with you.

696
00:32:36.64 --> 00:32:38.52
You've got some really good points.

697
00:32:38.52 --> 00:32:40.20
Let's see how this would play out.

698
00:32:40.20 --> 00:32:41.20
Talk me through it.

699
00:32:41.20 --> 00:32:42.20
Yeah.

700
00:32:42.20 --> 00:32:45.64
You can't even, you're like, you can't even know.

701
00:32:45.64 --> 00:32:47.44
You know, it's like a move.

702
00:32:47.44 --> 00:32:50.04
It's like a jiu-jitsu move.

703
00:32:50.04 --> 00:32:51.04
And it works.

704
00:32:51.04 --> 00:32:51.04
Yeah.

705
00:32:51.04 --> 00:32:54.56
Yeah.

706
00:32:54.56 --> 00:33:01.20
So there's some things I've changed my mind on about.

707
00:33:01.20 --> 00:33:03.56
My mind is open though.

708
00:33:03.56 --> 00:33:07.64
I will change my mind if new evidence presents itself.

709
00:33:07.64 --> 00:33:09.08
I'll change my mind in the heartbeat.

710
00:33:09.08 --> 00:33:10.48
You go to do it.

711
00:33:10.48 --> 00:33:12.20
Present me with new evidence.

712
00:33:12.20 --> 00:33:19.36
What about like, well, I would think anyway after kind of thinking about it where, yeah,

713
00:33:19.36 --> 00:33:24.36
you, I think, I think generally speaking, we do kind of respect someone who can change their

714
00:33:24.36 --> 00:33:25.36
mind.

715
00:33:25.36 --> 00:33:29.08
And we all see it once people's digging into their opinion, you know, and saying all kinds

716
00:33:29.08 --> 00:33:33.16
of weird wacky stuff to try to defend yourself and yourself and you're like, it's not

717
00:33:33.16 --> 00:33:34.56
what we're talking about kind of thing.

718
00:33:34.56 --> 00:33:35.76
You see it clear.

719
00:33:35.76 --> 00:33:39.80
So like, it seems obvious like, yeah, you should change your mind.

720
00:33:39.80 --> 00:33:44.84
Or at least open up your mind and like I said, I'll give that some consideration.

721
00:33:44.84 --> 00:33:45.84
I'll look into it.

722
00:33:45.84 --> 00:33:47.40
And if you're right, shoot, I think you're right.

723
00:33:47.40 --> 00:33:51.28
I think that's a better way to do it or whatever, whatever the case is.

724
00:33:51.28 --> 00:33:55.84
But the, and then I guess technically this is a dichotomy too where you can't do that

725
00:33:55.84 --> 00:33:59.84
too much because if you're always changing your mind with, like, you know, like, like,

726
00:33:59.84 --> 00:34:01.80
I don't know, we'll see a politician.

727
00:34:01.80 --> 00:34:02.80
Yeah.

728
00:34:02.80 --> 00:34:06.16
Every time the opposing view or some other view comes in, you're like, hey, I didn't look

729
00:34:06.16 --> 00:34:07.16
at it like that.

730
00:34:07.16 --> 00:34:09.68
Or I didn't, maybe I'll look back and look into that more.

731
00:34:09.68 --> 00:34:10.68
We'll do it again.

732
00:34:10.68 --> 00:34:12.96
And again, and again, it's like, Brad, does this guy know anything?

733
00:34:12.96 --> 00:34:15.16
Because guess where you're talking about?

734
00:34:15.16 --> 00:34:16.16
What?

735
00:34:16.16 --> 00:34:17.16
There's a dichotomy.

736
00:34:17.16 --> 00:34:21.20
And if you go too far and you change your opinion all the time and then you become

737
00:34:21.20 --> 00:34:23.64
indecisive, and so that doesn't work.

738
00:34:23.64 --> 00:34:26.96
But if you're so, if you're the other side of this spectrum and you're completely dug in

739
00:34:26.96 --> 00:34:29.08
and you never change your mind, that doesn't work either.

740
00:34:29.08 --> 00:34:29.92
Where you need to do?

741
00:34:29.92 --> 00:34:30.92
What do you need to do?

742
00:34:30.92 --> 00:34:34.88
You need to balance the dichotomy between being flexible and inflexible.

743
00:34:34.88 --> 00:34:38.76
If you become ultra flexible, you're just going with whatever anyone's saying, that's

744
00:34:38.76 --> 00:34:40.52
not good.

745
00:34:40.52 --> 00:34:41.88
You need to find the middle ground.

746
00:34:41.88 --> 00:34:44.52
That's what dichotomy and leadership is.

747
00:34:44.52 --> 00:34:47.40
But it's hard for people to comprehend that.

748
00:34:47.40 --> 00:34:52.44
It's hard for people to see that where they draw that line.

749
00:34:52.44 --> 00:34:54.52
Yes, that's a thing for the general.

750
00:34:54.52 --> 00:34:57.80
I'll never change my opinion on this.

751
00:34:57.80 --> 00:34:58.80
Okay.

752
00:34:58.80 --> 00:34:59.80
You just told me where you stand.

753
00:34:59.80 --> 00:35:01.92
Yeah, I'm not sure I like that very much.

754
00:35:01.92 --> 00:35:05.04
Because new information can come to light.

755
00:35:05.04 --> 00:35:10.56
Yeah, that's where they stand in that dichotomy or whatever.

756
00:35:10.56 --> 00:35:14.28
Because I think part of it, and it's part of it is like, yeah, they don't want to be

757
00:35:14.28 --> 00:35:16.16
wishy-washy.

758
00:35:16.16 --> 00:35:19.76
But the other part, or the other part of that is, I'm saying if they always change their

759
00:35:19.76 --> 00:35:22.48
mind over there, so easily to be like, okay, maybe we'll do it.

760
00:35:22.48 --> 00:35:23.84
You're way, way to the farmer.

761
00:35:23.84 --> 00:35:26.48
Yeah, I think they come off like they don't know anything.

762
00:35:26.48 --> 00:35:27.48
For sure.

763
00:35:27.48 --> 00:35:29.60
So if you don't know anything, should you even be in that position?

764
00:35:29.60 --> 00:35:32.16
Like, I don't want you to be the congressman.

765
00:35:32.16 --> 00:35:34.36
If you don't know anything kind of thing, right?

766
00:35:34.36 --> 00:35:35.80
That's the feeling.

767
00:35:35.80 --> 00:35:40.28
So, and now with that, that's the feeling that people are trying to avoid when they

768
00:35:40.28 --> 00:35:41.28
dig in.

769
00:35:41.28 --> 00:35:42.28
They don't want to admit they're wrong.

770
00:35:42.28 --> 00:35:43.28
Because if I admit, I'm wrong.

771
00:35:43.28 --> 00:35:44.28
I didn't know.

772
00:35:44.28 --> 00:35:45.28
You know, kind of thing.

773
00:35:45.28 --> 00:35:48.64
So it's like, no, bro, you don't draw the line right there.

774
00:35:48.64 --> 00:35:51.40
You draw the line couple steps down the road.

775
00:35:51.40 --> 00:35:52.40
Be open a little bit.

776
00:35:52.40 --> 00:35:53.84
If you're somewhere to maneuver.

777
00:35:53.84 --> 00:35:54.84
Yeah, again.

778
00:35:54.84 --> 00:35:55.84
Yeah.

779
00:35:55.84 --> 00:35:58.40
I'm just going to maneuver.

780
00:35:58.40 --> 00:36:00.88
Next question.

781
00:36:00.88 --> 00:36:06.20
How does one detach when getting personally attacked and take extreme ownership with false

782
00:36:06.20 --> 00:36:08.48
claims?

783
00:36:08.48 --> 00:36:12.80
And what does one do when a subordinate always goes above the chain of command instead of

784
00:36:12.80 --> 00:36:15.64
working out issues with the code worker?

785
00:36:15.64 --> 00:36:19.000
Okay, this is in the clearest question that I've ever received.

786
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.20
I'm going to try and, I'm not sure if I complete the understanding, but I'm going to try

787
00:36:22.20 --> 00:36:26.12
and sort of answer to the best of my ability.

788
00:36:26.12 --> 00:36:29.92
I think what we're talking about here is that someone is telling me that something

789
00:36:29.92 --> 00:36:33.48
gets my fault and that is a false claim.

790
00:36:33.48 --> 00:36:35.56
Is that, that's the question, right?

791
00:36:35.56 --> 00:36:39.84
I think you're making a false claim and saying, like, this is your responsibility,

792
00:36:39.84 --> 00:36:43.36
Marco, you were supposed to press record.

793
00:36:43.36 --> 00:36:46.16
And it's false because I wasn't supposed to press record.

794
00:36:46.16 --> 00:36:47.16
Yeah.

795
00:36:47.16 --> 00:36:48.16
Right, let's say.

796
00:36:48.16 --> 00:36:49.16
Yeah.

797
00:36:49.16 --> 00:36:52.000
Or maybe like, record was pressed.

798
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.40
Like, there's no issue.

799
00:36:54.40 --> 00:36:55.40
You know?

800
00:36:55.40 --> 00:36:59.000
Well, then why would you, why would that become a personal attack?

801
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Yeah.

802
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
I guess it wouldn't.

803
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.44
So the personal attack is, Chaco, you didn't press record.

804
00:37:05.44 --> 00:37:07.40
And now the question is, what do I do then?

805
00:37:07.40 --> 00:37:10.16
Because we both know who's in charge of press record here.

806
00:37:10.16 --> 00:37:11.16
Yeah.

807
00:37:11.16 --> 00:37:12.56
Who is me?

808
00:37:12.56 --> 00:37:15.000
Okay, so you're in charge of press record.

809
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.76
If you all of a sudden we are 40 minutes into a podcast and we haven't pressed record, the

810
00:37:21.76 --> 00:37:26.16
record has button has been pressed and all of a sudden it comes to light.

811
00:37:26.16 --> 00:37:29.48
And you say, Chaco, you didn't press record.

812
00:37:29.48 --> 00:37:32.96
Now what this person is saying, that's a false claim.

813
00:37:32.96 --> 00:37:33.96
Gotcha.

814
00:37:33.96 --> 00:37:34.96
That's not my responsibility.

815
00:37:34.96 --> 00:37:35.96
It's truly not my responsibility.

816
00:37:35.96 --> 00:37:38.80
I'm not going to actually, I should I be doing that.

817
00:37:38.80 --> 00:37:40.80
And you know what I'm going to say?

818
00:37:40.80 --> 00:37:41.80
You know what I'm going to say.

819
00:37:41.80 --> 00:37:42.80
Yes, right, too.

820
00:37:42.80 --> 00:37:43.80
Which is, you know what?

821
00:37:43.80 --> 00:37:45.16
It is my responsibility.

822
00:37:45.16 --> 00:37:46.16
Because I'm here.

823
00:37:46.16 --> 00:37:49.44
It's primarily my voice that's being recorded.

824
00:37:49.44 --> 00:37:51.44
And from now on, I will make sure that it's recorded.

825
00:37:51.44 --> 00:37:52.44
It's my fault.

826
00:37:52.44 --> 00:37:54.36
I will take care of it from now on.

827
00:37:54.36 --> 00:37:58.20
By the way, now what is your job responsibilities in this whole podcast?

828
00:37:58.20 --> 00:37:59.44
Nothing.

829
00:37:59.44 --> 00:38:00.44
Nothing.

830
00:38:00.44 --> 00:38:02.20
You have nothing to do.

831
00:38:02.20 --> 00:38:05.08
If you're not pressing record, you're not nothing to do.

832
00:38:05.08 --> 00:38:06.08
So how does that feel?

833
00:38:06.08 --> 00:38:07.08
It doesn't feel good.

834
00:38:07.08 --> 00:38:08.08
It doesn't feel good.

835
00:38:08.08 --> 00:38:09.08
You don't like that.

836
00:38:09.08 --> 00:38:11.88
But when I take away that responsibility, you're actually going to come and claw back

837
00:38:11.88 --> 00:38:12.88
from me.

838
00:38:12.88 --> 00:38:14.92
You're going to say, you know what?

839
00:38:14.92 --> 00:38:17.44
Actually, you know, it was your fault when that happened.

840
00:38:17.44 --> 00:38:20.36
But you know what, from now on, since you screwed it up, I'm going to take ownership

841
00:38:20.36 --> 00:38:21.36
of it.

842
00:38:21.36 --> 00:38:22.36
And you know what I say?

843
00:38:22.36 --> 00:38:23.36
I say, cool, that's awesome.

844
00:38:23.36 --> 00:38:24.36
Yeah, good point.

845
00:38:24.36 --> 00:38:27.56
Since you are over there with the recordings and your technical guy and I'm not.

846
00:38:27.56 --> 00:38:28.56
That makes a lot of sense.

847
00:38:28.56 --> 00:38:29.96
Why don't we go with that from now on?

848
00:38:29.96 --> 00:38:31.96
You own it.

849
00:38:31.96 --> 00:38:34.000
I shouldn't have dropped the ball last time.

850
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.04
You know.

851
00:38:36.04 --> 00:38:37.04
So that's that.

852
00:38:37.04 --> 00:38:38.04
So there we go.

853
00:38:38.04 --> 00:38:39.04
I don't want it.

854
00:38:39.04 --> 00:38:40.04
I fix it.

855
00:38:40.04 --> 00:38:42.68
By the way, if you don't want responsibility back, if you just say, cool, yeah, you

856
00:38:42.68 --> 00:38:43.68
press a quarter from now on.

857
00:38:43.68 --> 00:38:44.68
Okay, cool.

858
00:38:44.68 --> 00:38:45.68
I will.

859
00:38:45.68 --> 00:38:46.68
And then guess what?

860
00:38:46.68 --> 00:38:49.48
I'll start thinking about how much I need you around here.

861
00:38:49.48 --> 00:38:51.28
Because really, what else do you bring to the table?

862
00:38:51.28 --> 00:38:52.28
And it'll be.

863
00:38:52.28 --> 00:38:53.28
All right.

864
00:38:53.28 --> 00:38:58.000
So that's question number one.

865
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.68
The question number two, as far as detaching.

866
00:39:00.68 --> 00:39:01.92
So I don't get emotional.

867
00:39:01.92 --> 00:39:10.36
If someone is blaming me, if someone is blaming me, if you start blaming me for something,

868
00:39:10.36 --> 00:39:12.000
I actually look at that right on the gate.

869
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.80
I see that it's a psychological victory for me.

870
00:39:14.80 --> 00:39:16.72
Because you're blaming me.

871
00:39:16.72 --> 00:39:17.72
Like you're blaming.

872
00:39:17.72 --> 00:39:18.72
You're not taking ownership.

873
00:39:18.72 --> 00:39:19.72
I already won.

874
00:39:19.72 --> 00:39:20.72
I already won.

875
00:39:20.72 --> 00:39:22.56
So there's no, I'm not getting emotional about that.

876
00:39:22.56 --> 00:39:28.52
That's their blaming me because they don't have the where we fall to actually take

877
00:39:28.52 --> 00:39:29.52
ownership themselves.

878
00:39:29.52 --> 00:39:32.36
I see that as a weakness of theirs and I'm fine with it.

879
00:39:32.36 --> 00:39:36.72
And that's why I'm not going to, I don't need to get emotional because I'm sitting there going

880
00:39:36.72 --> 00:39:38.96
wow, this person just served me up on a silver platter.

881
00:39:38.96 --> 00:39:41.76
The fact that they don't want to take ownership, I'm not going to give it to me.

882
00:39:41.76 --> 00:39:42.76
Are you kidding me?

883
00:39:42.76 --> 00:39:44.20
I'll take this all day long.

884
00:39:44.20 --> 00:39:48.56
Another thing is, and I've said this before, I can't be respect.

885
00:39:48.56 --> 00:39:52.88
I can't be disrespected by someone that doesn't even respect themselves.

886
00:39:52.88 --> 00:39:53.88
You know what I'm saying?

887
00:39:53.88 --> 00:39:56.16
You can't just respect me.

888
00:39:56.16 --> 00:39:59.48
If you don't even respect yourself, if you're just like a bum in the street,

889
00:39:59.48 --> 00:40:07.12
where the thing came from, you know, someone that's just a drunk bum laying in his own vomit

890
00:40:07.12 --> 00:40:12.76
and wants to, you know, look at me and say, you look like a dirt bag.

891
00:40:12.76 --> 00:40:13.76
Yeah.

892
00:40:13.76 --> 00:40:17.000
Okay, I did carry on with your day.

893
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000
You're not going to affect me.

894
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.56
So how in the same vein, how can I be disrespected by you when you tell me when you blame

895
00:40:24.56 --> 00:40:27.28
me for something when I realized what's happening right now is you don't even have

896
00:40:27.28 --> 00:40:30.12
enough respect for yourself to take ownership of something.

897
00:40:30.12 --> 00:40:34.16
This is just a wind.

898
00:40:34.16 --> 00:40:35.16
So that's the second part of it.

899
00:40:35.16 --> 00:40:40.56
And I think the third part of the question is a subordinate that goes up the chain of

900
00:40:40.56 --> 00:40:45.28
command, instead of working out the issues with the coworker, that's pretty pretty easy.

901
00:40:45.28 --> 00:40:46.88
I'm not going to solve those problems for you.

902
00:40:46.88 --> 00:40:51.52
Oh, you're going to problem down the chain of command with your coworker, your peer,

903
00:40:51.52 --> 00:40:54.84
and you guys aren't working it out, and you want me to solve your problem?

904
00:40:54.84 --> 00:40:58.12
No, you go figure it out and come back to me with the solution.

905
00:40:58.12 --> 00:41:00.92
Now I'll do that a couple of times if eventually they can't come up with a solution.

906
00:41:00.92 --> 00:41:01.92
Guess what I have?

907
00:41:01.92 --> 00:41:02.92
I have a problem.

908
00:41:02.92 --> 00:41:06.76
I have a real problem, and I will solve it, and they're not going to like my solution.

909
00:41:06.76 --> 00:41:10.40
Because it probably involves neither one of them being there anymore.

910
00:41:10.40 --> 00:41:14.44
Extreme case, but what I will do is I say, okay, come and read me the facts.

911
00:41:14.44 --> 00:41:16.000
You really want me to make a decision about this?

912
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Cool.

913
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000
I'll do it.

914
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.16
But I always felt horrible.

915
00:41:20.16 --> 00:41:22.16
In fact, I don't even know if I ever did this.

916
00:41:22.16 --> 00:41:25.92
I'm going to my boss to make a decision about something that I should have agreed with my

917
00:41:25.92 --> 00:41:26.92
peer.

918
00:41:26.92 --> 00:41:27.92
Because you know what?

919
00:41:27.92 --> 00:41:29.60
I'd rather just, for me, I'd rather say, hey, you know what?

920
00:41:29.60 --> 00:41:31.12
You want to do it your way, echo fine.

921
00:41:31.12 --> 00:41:32.40
And you, let's go with it.

922
00:41:32.40 --> 00:41:34.28
It's close enough.

923
00:41:34.28 --> 00:41:36.04
You, oh, you want to take the lead?

924
00:41:36.04 --> 00:41:37.04
Cool.

925
00:41:37.04 --> 00:41:38.04
You take the lead.

926
00:41:38.04 --> 00:41:39.04
I'll support you.

927
00:41:39.04 --> 00:41:40.04
No problem.

928
00:41:40.04 --> 00:41:41.04
That's what I'm here for.

929
00:41:41.04 --> 00:41:42.04
I want the team to win.

930
00:41:42.04 --> 00:41:43.44
I know you're concerned about you, and I know that's fine.

931
00:41:43.44 --> 00:41:44.44
That's fine.

932
00:41:44.44 --> 00:41:45.44
I'm here for the team.

933
00:41:45.44 --> 00:41:48.72
So let's do it your way, so that it works out.

934
00:41:48.72 --> 00:41:51.08
Not going to my boss and complaining.

935
00:41:51.08 --> 00:41:52.08
That's just ridiculous.

936
00:41:52.08 --> 00:41:56.44
And then that's another one where I'm fit in.

937
00:41:56.44 --> 00:42:04.04
I don't think I've ever been in a corporate scenario, but it seems like that that's easy

938
00:42:04.04 --> 00:42:06.20
to see another people, you know?

939
00:42:06.20 --> 00:42:12.08
Like where, you know how like a situation where, yeah, let me let my subordinate take lead.

940
00:42:12.08 --> 00:42:16.08
It seems like that could be a solid, almost obvious answer for people.

941
00:42:16.08 --> 00:42:17.52
Yeah, except myself.

942
00:42:17.52 --> 00:42:20.76
You know, like I don't, I don't always point that in.

943
00:42:20.76 --> 00:42:23.60
Or, you know, I'm sure there's like people out there where it's like, oh, that this

944
00:42:23.60 --> 00:42:25.24
will solve probably a lot of your problems.

945
00:42:25.24 --> 00:42:28.000
Just look at it this way and do it and do that.

946
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.80
You know, let one of your subordinates like take lead on the stuff.

947
00:42:31.80 --> 00:42:39.84
And I would predict, suppose that goes, that most people would be pretty surprised.

948
00:42:39.84 --> 00:42:45.48
Like, oh, yeah, I guess I should, I should do that, you know, at this point.

949
00:42:45.48 --> 00:42:46.48
So you're saying that's it.

950
00:42:46.48 --> 00:42:48.96
It's a pretty obvious solution once you hear it.

951
00:42:48.96 --> 00:42:49.96
Yeah.

952
00:42:49.96 --> 00:42:53.80
I think that's a difficult solution to actually execute because most people put in the situation.

953
00:42:53.80 --> 00:42:54.80
Don't remember it.

954
00:42:54.80 --> 00:42:56.44
Yeah, they don't remember to point it inwards.

955
00:42:56.44 --> 00:42:57.44
Yeah.

956
00:42:57.44 --> 00:43:01.04
Even like, literally you could be getting this advice like right now.

957
00:43:01.04 --> 00:43:02.04
You could be getting this advice.

958
00:43:02.04 --> 00:43:05.40
But hey, yeah, chocolate, that sounds like good advice and then no go like back to work.

959
00:43:05.40 --> 00:43:07.84
And you know, it applies to everyone else, you know?

960
00:43:07.84 --> 00:43:09.04
It's like you don't realize it.

961
00:43:09.04 --> 00:43:10.84
Like, man, I should do that, you know?

962
00:43:10.84 --> 00:43:11.84
Kind of thing.

963
00:43:11.84 --> 00:43:14.04
Yeah, that's the trouble with learning.

964
00:43:14.04 --> 00:43:16.24
Like, let's just trouble with learning.

965
00:43:16.24 --> 00:43:18.28
It's hard to apply it yourself.

966
00:43:18.28 --> 00:43:19.28
Yeah.

967
00:43:19.28 --> 00:43:20.96
Once again, it's like you're jitsu.

968
00:43:20.96 --> 00:43:23.72
You can watch, I can show you how to do it.

969
00:43:23.72 --> 00:43:25.28
And then you can watch me do it.

970
00:43:25.28 --> 00:43:28.04
And then I can move your limbs around so that you do it.

971
00:43:28.04 --> 00:43:33.12
And then we do a drill where we drill the move 20 times.

972
00:43:33.12 --> 00:43:35.84
And then you get into a competition.

973
00:43:35.84 --> 00:43:38.04
And they move is there and you don't execute it.

974
00:43:38.04 --> 00:43:40.40
You don't execute it correctly because you haven't done it enough.

975
00:43:40.40 --> 00:43:41.72
Yeah.

976
00:43:41.72 --> 00:43:44.20
You have to do the move.

977
00:43:44.20 --> 00:43:45.04
Kind of do the move.

978
00:43:45.04 --> 00:43:46.20
You've got to do the move.

979
00:43:46.20 --> 00:43:50.44
Next one.

980
00:43:50.44 --> 00:43:56.04
So I'm watching Deadliest Catch, the fishing show.

981
00:43:56.04 --> 00:43:57.44
Wait, crab.

982
00:43:57.44 --> 00:43:58.44
Crab, crab.

983
00:43:58.44 --> 00:43:59.44
Crabbing show.

984
00:43:59.44 --> 00:44:00.44
Yeah.

985
00:44:00.44 --> 00:44:01.44
Alaskan, crab.

986
00:44:01.44 --> 00:44:02.44
Mm.

987
00:44:02.44 --> 00:44:03.44
Respect.

988
00:44:03.44 --> 00:44:05.96
So I'm watching Deadliest Catch.

989
00:44:05.96 --> 00:44:14.36
And a deckhand wasn't paying attention and let too many small crabs into the tank.

990
00:44:14.36 --> 00:44:15.88
This is big trouble for the captain.

991
00:44:15.88 --> 00:44:18.64
No, the kid admits his mistake and apologizes.

992
00:44:18.64 --> 00:44:20.52
Captain, you're fired.

993
00:44:20.52 --> 00:44:23.80
I've watched you screw up for years.

994
00:44:23.80 --> 00:44:24.80
What's the message here?

995
00:44:24.80 --> 00:44:25.80
Yeah.

996
00:44:25.80 --> 00:44:26.80
So it's the captain that fires.

997
00:44:26.80 --> 00:44:27.80
Yes.

998
00:44:27.80 --> 00:44:29.16
It sees the mistake and says the captain says you're fired.

999
00:44:29.16 --> 00:44:30.16
Okay, got you.

1000
00:44:30.16 --> 00:44:31.16
Okay.

1001
00:44:31.16 --> 00:44:32.16
Okay.

1002
00:44:32.16 --> 00:44:34.16
So this is, this tells me a couple things.

1003
00:44:34.16 --> 00:44:35.16
This tells me a few things.

1004
00:44:35.16 --> 00:44:36.76
This tells me a lot of things.

1005
00:44:36.76 --> 00:44:37.76
Right?

1006
00:44:37.76 --> 00:44:43.68
First of all, the boss watched the deckhand screw up for years.

1007
00:44:43.68 --> 00:44:47.24
My assumption is that he didn't say anything.

1008
00:44:47.24 --> 00:44:49.36
He watched someone screw up for years.

1009
00:44:49.36 --> 00:44:54.92
How is the deckhand going to improve if he doesn't get counseled on what his shortfalls

1010
00:44:54.92 --> 00:44:55.92
are?

1011
00:44:55.92 --> 00:44:58.68
Okay, so that could have happened.

1012
00:44:58.68 --> 00:44:59.92
That's one assumption.

1013
00:44:59.92 --> 00:45:01.12
Let's make the other assumption.

1014
00:45:01.12 --> 00:45:05.66
The other assumption is that the captain did counsel the deckhand and watched him screw

1015
00:45:05.66 --> 00:45:07.28
up for years and told him you better not do that.

1016
00:45:07.28 --> 00:45:08.28
You better not do that.

1017
00:45:08.28 --> 00:45:09.28
You better not do that.

1018
00:45:09.28 --> 00:45:10.56
And he's now done it again.

1019
00:45:10.56 --> 00:45:11.56
And guess what?

1020
00:45:11.56 --> 00:45:12.56
He's getting fired.

1021
00:45:12.56 --> 00:45:18.36
So that's understandable.

1022
00:45:18.36 --> 00:45:27.08
So I think the question is implying kind of like, hey, hey boss, this was my fault.

1023
00:45:27.08 --> 00:45:28.88
Shouldn't let that happen.

1024
00:45:28.88 --> 00:45:33.24
And now the boss can say, oh, since you're taking ownership of that, that's no problem.

1025
00:45:33.24 --> 00:45:35.16
We'll let it go.

1026
00:45:35.16 --> 00:45:37.000
That doesn't happen.

1027
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.52
So if you have a concept in your brain that you think that when you take ownership

1028
00:45:42.52 --> 00:45:47.96
from something that you're immune then from the punishment of the mistake you've made, that's

1029
00:45:47.96 --> 00:45:48.96
not true.

1030
00:45:48.96 --> 00:45:50.92
That's absolutely not true.

1031
00:45:50.92 --> 00:45:59.44
Taking ownership of a mistake does not relieve you of responsibility of that mistake.

1032
00:45:59.44 --> 00:46:03.52
In fact, the opposite of true, when you take ownership of a mistake, you're taking ownership

1033
00:46:03.52 --> 00:46:08.68
of the mistake and you are raising your hand and saying, I own the mistake.

1034
00:46:08.68 --> 00:46:16.000
And if there's punishment to be met and out, it needs to land on me.

1035
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.64
That's what ownership is.

1036
00:46:17.64 --> 00:46:21.88
Ownership is not to get out of jail free card.

1037
00:46:21.88 --> 00:46:22.88
You know what, it's my fault.

1038
00:46:22.88 --> 00:46:24.04
You know, we joke about this.

1039
00:46:24.04 --> 00:46:25.04
His my bust.

1040
00:46:25.04 --> 00:46:26.44
Hey, my bust on that one.

1041
00:46:26.44 --> 00:46:28.12
It won't happen again.

1042
00:46:28.12 --> 00:46:29.72
So now everyone just ignores it?

1043
00:46:29.72 --> 00:46:30.72
No.

1044
00:46:30.72 --> 00:46:33.16
This is a serious violation.

1045
00:46:33.16 --> 00:46:37.76
Having the wrong size crabs is kind of thing to get you rolled up by the fishing game

1046
00:46:37.76 --> 00:46:40.36
department and all of a sudden you're getting shot down.

1047
00:46:40.36 --> 00:46:43.24
It's a serious business.

1048
00:46:43.24 --> 00:46:45.16
Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and thousands of dollars.

1049
00:46:45.16 --> 00:46:47.36
If not more, or at stake here.

1050
00:46:47.36 --> 00:46:49.92
And this kid isn't doing his job correctly.

1051
00:46:49.92 --> 00:46:56.84
So either the boss, the captain, had mentored him and was fed up, which makes him a good

1052
00:46:56.84 --> 00:46:57.84
boss.

1053
00:46:57.84 --> 00:46:59.80
And this was his last warning and he failed his last warning.

1054
00:46:59.80 --> 00:47:00.80
And there you go.

1055
00:47:00.80 --> 00:47:02.16
Hey, I've been watching you screw up.

1056
00:47:02.16 --> 00:47:03.16
I told you you screwed up.

1057
00:47:03.16 --> 00:47:06.08
I've written you up about screwing up and I told you not to let this happen again.

1058
00:47:06.08 --> 00:47:07.08
And you just let it happen again.

1059
00:47:07.08 --> 00:47:09.40
You're fired.

1060
00:47:09.40 --> 00:47:12.24
Or maybe the boss wasn't that square away.

1061
00:47:12.24 --> 00:47:13.24
And he hadn't counted.

1062
00:47:13.24 --> 00:47:16.96
He hadn't had the hard conversations early with him to square him away.

1063
00:47:16.96 --> 00:47:20.24
And now the boss leaves something to be desired.

1064
00:47:20.24 --> 00:47:26.12
Because he's just the first offense that he talks him about his hey, you're fired.

1065
00:47:26.12 --> 00:47:31.80
When I took ownership of the blue on blue, in extreme ownership, first chapter, I could

1066
00:47:31.80 --> 00:47:34.08
have been fired for that.

1067
00:47:34.08 --> 00:47:35.08
I could have been fired.

1068
00:47:35.08 --> 00:47:36.08
My boss could have said, yeah.

1069
00:47:36.08 --> 00:47:37.04
Yeah, you're right.

1070
00:47:37.04 --> 00:47:37.76
This is your fault.

1071
00:47:37.76 --> 00:47:39.32
We can't have that happen out here.

1072
00:47:39.32 --> 00:47:40.32
You're fired.

1073
00:47:40.32 --> 00:47:44.16
And I said, Roger that.

1074
00:47:44.16 --> 00:47:46.000
It's not hey, I own this.

1075
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Please let me go.

1076
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.36
Yeah, I took this.

1077
00:47:49.36 --> 00:47:53.68
Now here, I will say this though.

1078
00:47:53.68 --> 00:47:58.36
So taking extreme ownership is not a get out of jail free card.

1079
00:47:58.36 --> 00:48:04.04
But I will tell you this, if you make excuses, it is going to be worst in 99% of the

1080
00:48:04.04 --> 00:48:05.04
situations.

1081
00:48:05.04 --> 00:48:11.36
Well, you know the small crab snuck in when I wasn't looking, that's not my fault.

1082
00:48:11.36 --> 00:48:14.88
Tactical crabs on the moon.

1083
00:48:14.88 --> 00:48:17.92
Then you just look like an idiot.

1084
00:48:17.92 --> 00:48:19.16
Right?

1085
00:48:19.16 --> 00:48:24.92
So another thing that this brings up is this idea of preemptive ownership.

1086
00:48:24.92 --> 00:48:28.80
And that is taking ownership of something.

1087
00:48:28.80 --> 00:48:34.04
You don't want to take ownership after the fact.

1088
00:48:34.04 --> 00:48:39.80
Using ownership, the idea of extreme ownership in its purest and most effective form

1089
00:48:39.80 --> 00:48:41.48
is an hay, something went wrong.

1090
00:48:41.48 --> 00:48:43.64
And I'm now taking ownership of the mistake.

1091
00:48:43.64 --> 00:48:47.80
That's not the best extreme ownership scenario.

1092
00:48:47.80 --> 00:48:52.12
The best extreme ownership scenario is when you take ownership prior to the mistake

1093
00:48:52.12 --> 00:48:53.44
happening.

1094
00:48:53.44 --> 00:48:58.80
And you realize that if there is going to be a mistake, you are going to own it.

1095
00:48:58.80 --> 00:49:02.36
So what you're going to do is you're going to work hard to prevent that mistake from

1096
00:49:02.36 --> 00:49:03.76
happening.

1097
00:49:03.76 --> 00:49:05.32
That's preemptive ownership.

1098
00:49:05.32 --> 00:49:07.68
You're taking ownership before the mistake happens.

1099
00:49:07.68 --> 00:49:13.68
So this kid, this deck hand, could have put procedures in place to make sure no small

1100
00:49:13.68 --> 00:49:14.68
crabs got in.

1101
00:49:14.68 --> 00:49:17.32
It's sorted them out properly.

1102
00:49:17.32 --> 00:49:18.68
But instead he thought, oh, you know what?

1103
00:49:18.68 --> 00:49:19.68
It'd be no big deal.

1104
00:49:19.68 --> 00:49:22.04
Just take ownership and then they'll say, it's okay.

1105
00:49:22.04 --> 00:49:24.24
Or you know all the way and someone else or whatever has thinking it is.

1106
00:49:24.24 --> 00:49:29.12
And he says, look, if I let small crabs in here, I am going to own it and I am going

1107
00:49:29.12 --> 00:49:31.24
to get fired.

1108
00:49:31.24 --> 00:49:32.24
Guess what?

1109
00:49:32.24 --> 00:49:36.40
Perhaps he would have worked a little harder to prevent the small crabs from being

1110
00:49:36.40 --> 00:49:39.000
where they weren't supposed to be.

1111
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.08
But see, when you have that out, when you think you can just blame someone else, that

1112
00:49:43.08 --> 00:49:44.92
allows you to be slack.

1113
00:49:44.92 --> 00:49:45.92
Yeah.

1114
00:49:45.92 --> 00:49:48.84
When you think, well, this isn't really my response.

1115
00:49:48.84 --> 00:49:53.32
But that's why when I work with companies, I don't have some thing that's going wrong.

1116
00:49:53.32 --> 00:49:54.32
Some problem.

1117
00:49:54.32 --> 00:49:56.64
Some procedure that's not working correctly.

1118
00:49:56.64 --> 00:49:59.000
Some timeline that's not being met.

1119
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.76
And one of the first questions I ask it, normally like a huge step in the right direction

1120
00:50:03.76 --> 00:50:09.64
to resolve the problem, is I go, okay, who's in charge of that process?

1121
00:50:09.64 --> 00:50:13.04
And I'll bunch of people who we're looking around at each other and no one's raising their

1122
00:50:13.04 --> 00:50:14.04
hand.

1123
00:50:14.04 --> 00:50:17.12
And the minute I see that, I go, interesting.

1124
00:50:17.12 --> 00:50:18.80
This is the answer to me.

1125
00:50:18.80 --> 00:50:21.96
Now we know why the process is ineffective because no one has ownership of it.

1126
00:50:21.96 --> 00:50:24.40
And if no one has ownership of it and the thing doesn't get done when it's supposed

1127
00:50:24.40 --> 00:50:26.60
to get done, everyone just points at each other and says, yeah, well, the one that

1128
00:50:26.60 --> 00:50:28.92
my fault is this fault is their fault.

1129
00:50:28.92 --> 00:50:31.32
And then no one takes ownership of no one solves it.

1130
00:50:31.32 --> 00:50:35.48
Whereas if you say, okay, echo you are in charge of this process.

1131
00:50:35.48 --> 00:50:38.76
If it doesn't work, I'm coming after you.

1132
00:50:38.76 --> 00:50:45.000
You know, now you can step up your game, preemptively, to prevent a mistake from occurring,

1133
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.32
prevent the little crabs from getting in the pot.

1134
00:50:49.32 --> 00:50:51.68
So taking ownership isn't a good idea.

1135
00:50:51.68 --> 00:50:54.52
Get out of jail, free card.

1136
00:50:54.52 --> 00:50:58.96
If you have a subordinate, you are actually responsible for counseling them and coaching

1137
00:50:58.96 --> 00:51:03.28
them and mentoring them and explaining to them what the standards are so that they can

1138
00:51:03.28 --> 00:51:07.52
meet the standards explaining explicitly what the standards are so that they can meet those

1139
00:51:07.52 --> 00:51:09.96
standards.

1140
00:51:09.96 --> 00:51:21.48
And the optimal ownership takes place not only after, but more importantly, before something

1141
00:51:21.48 --> 00:51:22.48
goes wrong.

1142
00:51:22.48 --> 00:51:27.04
There you go.

1143
00:51:27.04 --> 00:51:30.20
Not to mention, you got a take responsibility for solving the problem.

1144
00:51:30.20 --> 00:51:31.20
Yes, you do.

1145
00:51:31.20 --> 00:51:34.64
Apparently this decam guy, that's not the.

1146
00:51:34.64 --> 00:51:36.40
He didn't take his ownership for the mistake.

1147
00:51:36.40 --> 00:51:38.60
He didn't take ownership for solving the problem.

1148
00:51:38.60 --> 00:51:41.40
He also didn't implement a solution to the problem.

1149
00:51:41.40 --> 00:51:42.40
There's all kinds of problems.

1150
00:51:42.40 --> 00:51:43.40
For years.

1151
00:51:43.40 --> 00:51:44.40
By the way, yeah.

1152
00:51:44.40 --> 00:51:46.04
So there you go.

1153
00:51:46.04 --> 00:51:47.52
Next question.

1154
00:51:47.52 --> 00:51:51.60
One mistakes did you make early, discussed in your live podcast that could have progressed

1155
00:51:51.60 --> 00:51:52.60
to you further.

1156
00:51:52.60 --> 00:51:56.84
Yeah, I think there's just some real big obvious ones.

1157
00:51:56.84 --> 00:51:59.56
Wasted a bunch of time.

1158
00:51:59.56 --> 00:52:02.48
You know, you wasted a bunch of time when you're young.

1159
00:52:02.48 --> 00:52:07.92
You think you got forever and you waste time and whether it's doing stuff that's not

1160
00:52:07.92 --> 00:52:12.48
productive, whether it's going out, get drunk.

1161
00:52:12.48 --> 00:52:17.52
Whatever dumb things you waste time doing, whether it's just wasting time.

1162
00:52:17.52 --> 00:52:22.76
And you know what?

1163
00:52:22.76 --> 00:52:24.28
Look, I'm not saying don't have fun in your life because that's wrong answer to that's too

1164
00:52:24.28 --> 00:52:25.28
extreme.

1165
00:52:25.28 --> 00:52:28.32
What I am saying is I sometimes add a little too much fun.

1166
00:52:28.32 --> 00:52:29.76
Sometimes I wasn't focused on the right thing.

1167
00:52:29.76 --> 00:52:31.08
So wasted time is number one.

1168
00:52:31.08 --> 00:52:32.08
Wasted money.

1169
00:52:32.08 --> 00:52:36.08
Wasted a ton of money on dumb stuff.

1170
00:52:36.08 --> 00:52:40.000
And I'd say that both of these are wasting time wasting money.

1171
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.88
Those are like the two biggest mistakes that I've made.

1172
00:52:44.88 --> 00:52:51.88
But I would say the root of those mistakes is that I didn't do a good job of connecting

1173
00:52:51.88 --> 00:52:54.48
the future to the present.

1174
00:52:54.48 --> 00:52:58.56
You just don't, when you're young, I shouldn't say that.

1175
00:52:58.56 --> 00:53:03.76
When I wish, I don't want to put a universal blanket of being dumb on everyone, even though

1176
00:53:03.76 --> 00:53:06.76
you're not in your head pretty hard to leave over there.

1177
00:53:06.76 --> 00:53:07.76
That's the thing.

1178
00:53:07.76 --> 00:53:10.36
Yeah, we see a lot of people do this.

1179
00:53:10.36 --> 00:53:11.36
Right.

1180
00:53:11.36 --> 00:53:14.60
A lot of us, we waste our time, we waste our money and we don't connect what we're doing

1181
00:53:14.60 --> 00:53:17.20
right now with what's going to happen in the future.

1182
00:53:17.20 --> 00:53:19.32
And that is not a good policy to have.

1183
00:53:19.32 --> 00:53:25.000
What we want to do and what I try and instill with kids, with my kids, with kids that I talk

1184
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.28
about on the podcast is I want to connect what decisions are being made right now with

1185
00:53:30.28 --> 00:53:36.28
decisions that will, with the, with the end state that you end up with in your future.

1186
00:53:36.28 --> 00:53:40.24
So if you take advantage of your time, you're going to be in a much better place.

1187
00:53:40.24 --> 00:53:42.36
If you save your money, you're going to be in a much better place.

1188
00:53:42.36 --> 00:53:45.24
If you invest your money properly, you're going to be in a much better place.

1189
00:53:45.24 --> 00:53:48.000
If you train and you treat people, if you train hard, you're going to be in a much better

1190
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000
place.

1191
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.56
If you treat people respectfully and you build relationships, you're going to be in a much better

1192
00:53:51.56 --> 00:53:53.64
place.

1193
00:53:53.64 --> 00:53:55.80
If you do the opposite of those things, you're going to be in a worse place.

1194
00:53:55.80 --> 00:53:59.08
If you treat people like dirt, you're going to, they'll come back to bite you.

1195
00:53:59.08 --> 00:54:00.64
If you waste your money, you won't have it.

1196
00:54:00.64 --> 00:54:03.12
If you waste your time, you'll run out.

1197
00:54:03.12 --> 00:54:11.64
So I think the biggest mistake really for me was that I failed to connect the present to

1198
00:54:11.64 --> 00:54:12.64
the future.

1199
00:54:12.64 --> 00:54:18.68
There are only ways that I succeeded in that early on, was through luck.

1200
00:54:18.68 --> 00:54:24.32
Like I joined the Navy and I'm very lucky that I did because I was immediately building

1201
00:54:24.32 --> 00:54:25.32
my future.

1202
00:54:25.32 --> 00:54:28.64
Even though I had no, I wasn't my intent as immediately.

1203
00:54:28.64 --> 00:54:33.16
I bought a house that was great.

1204
00:54:33.16 --> 00:54:34.48
What did I buy it for?

1205
00:54:34.48 --> 00:54:36.36
I wanted a place to live.

1206
00:54:36.36 --> 00:54:37.36
What did I end up with?

1207
00:54:37.36 --> 00:54:39.36
An incredible investment.

1208
00:54:39.36 --> 00:54:41.56
Enough to buy another house.

1209
00:54:41.56 --> 00:54:43.44
That one was a little bit more intentional.

1210
00:54:43.44 --> 00:54:44.44
Wait a second.

1211
00:54:44.44 --> 00:54:50.12
If I owned another house, and I was just talking about this with a friend of mine, it was

1212
00:54:50.12 --> 00:54:57.16
explaining when he remembered when I got my second house.

1213
00:54:57.16 --> 00:55:05.72
I was in my mind, Donald J. Trump, the real estate landlord, like master.

1214
00:55:05.72 --> 00:55:10.52
Someone was going to be paying me rent.

1215
00:55:10.52 --> 00:55:13.88
I had another house that I was going to live in.

1216
00:55:13.88 --> 00:55:19.68
So that was what I started making this shift where I connected the present with the future.

1217
00:55:19.68 --> 00:55:20.68
Yeah.

1218
00:55:20.68 --> 00:55:25.08
So what you do today is directly correlated to where you'll end up in the future.

1219
00:55:25.08 --> 00:55:32.04
That is in Ecos, favorite sort of thread of this entire podcast, is playing the long

1220
00:55:32.04 --> 00:55:33.04
war.

1221
00:55:33.04 --> 00:55:36.04
It took me too long to start fighting the long war.

1222
00:55:36.04 --> 00:55:37.04
That's what I'll say.

1223
00:55:37.04 --> 00:55:40.48
That was, say, the biggest mistakes from my early life.

1224
00:55:40.48 --> 00:55:41.48
Yeah.

1225
00:55:41.48 --> 00:55:47.24
And really, in a way, they could be viewed as not even really mistakes.

1226
00:55:47.24 --> 00:55:52.16
I guess this is more of just sort of the way things happen.

1227
00:55:52.16 --> 00:55:58.16
Because be most times we figure these things out later in life when the long game starts

1228
00:55:58.16 --> 00:55:59.16
to materialize.

1229
00:55:59.16 --> 00:56:03.48
Because when you're early in your career, the only short game is sort of there.

1230
00:56:03.48 --> 00:56:06.52
And then in a way, actually no, at the end of the day, no.

1231
00:56:06.52 --> 00:56:08.64
Because even as a little kid, you know the long game.

1232
00:56:08.64 --> 00:56:09.64
You're familiar with it.

1233
00:56:09.64 --> 00:56:10.64
A little bit.

1234
00:56:10.64 --> 00:56:15.52
Because like, you ever had to save your money for something like an optimist price.

1235
00:56:15.52 --> 00:56:16.52
Yeah.

1236
00:56:16.52 --> 00:56:17.92
You know, something like that.

1237
00:56:17.92 --> 00:56:20.88
And they said, you got to save your money for it.

1238
00:56:20.88 --> 00:56:22.92
And, bro, you save your money.

1239
00:56:22.92 --> 00:56:24.80
That's playing the long game.

1240
00:56:24.80 --> 00:56:26.44
As a kid, you know, it's a kid version.

1241
00:56:26.44 --> 00:56:28.16
So it's kind of the same thing.

1242
00:56:28.16 --> 00:56:31.72
But maybe it's not as intuitive, you know, when you're little, when you're big, when you're

1243
00:56:31.72 --> 00:56:32.72
grown.

1244
00:56:32.72 --> 00:56:34.72
No, you're not saying to do it.

1245
00:56:34.72 --> 00:56:39.32
It's the other thing is like, someone has to tell you.

1246
00:56:39.32 --> 00:56:43.52
But like we just talked about, sometimes when people tell you you still just don't listen

1247
00:56:43.52 --> 00:56:44.52
to them.

1248
00:56:44.52 --> 00:56:45.52
Yeah.

1249
00:56:45.52 --> 00:56:46.52
Yeah.

1250
00:56:46.52 --> 00:56:47.68
You know, people say, hey, you should really do this.

1251
00:56:47.68 --> 00:56:48.68
And you go, yeah, whatever.

1252
00:56:48.68 --> 00:56:49.68
That's for you.

1253
00:56:49.68 --> 00:56:50.68
Yeah.

1254
00:56:50.68 --> 00:56:51.68
I'm gonna say that.

1255
00:56:51.68 --> 00:56:52.68
Yeah.

1256
00:56:52.68 --> 00:56:53.68
That's for you.

1257
00:56:53.68 --> 00:56:59.40
One of my uncle's friends won the lottery.

1258
00:56:59.40 --> 00:57:02.20
Years ago, like in the 70s.

1259
00:57:02.20 --> 00:57:08.44
And he won one of those big lotteries, where he got money every year.

1260
00:57:08.44 --> 00:57:11.28
You know, you could take the lump son or you could take the payments.

1261
00:57:11.28 --> 00:57:12.28
The payments.

1262
00:57:12.28 --> 00:57:13.28
He took the payments.

1263
00:57:13.28 --> 00:57:14.28
Yeah.

1264
00:57:14.28 --> 00:57:15.28
But one of the lottery.

1265
00:57:15.28 --> 00:57:16.28
Right?

1266
00:57:16.28 --> 00:57:17.28
Literally one of the lottery.

1267
00:57:17.28 --> 00:57:18.52
Literally one of the lottery.

1268
00:57:18.52 --> 00:57:21.16
And so the payments lasted 20 years.

1269
00:57:21.16 --> 00:57:24.52
Well, when you're 22, that's forever.

1270
00:57:24.52 --> 00:57:25.52
Yeah.

1271
00:57:25.52 --> 00:57:26.52
Right?

1272
00:57:26.52 --> 00:57:27.52
That's forever.

1273
00:57:27.52 --> 00:57:28.52
Yeah.

1274
00:57:28.52 --> 00:57:31.96
And so my dad was talking to him.

1275
00:57:31.96 --> 00:57:32.96
Talking to his guy that won the lottery.

1276
00:57:32.96 --> 00:57:35.44
And now he was at like the 19 year mark.

1277
00:57:35.44 --> 00:57:36.44
Yeah.

1278
00:57:36.44 --> 00:57:38.12
And guess what he had done with all this money?

1279
00:57:38.12 --> 00:57:40.36
That's what he invested in real estate.

1280
00:57:40.36 --> 00:57:42.44
Did he buy start companies?

1281
00:57:42.44 --> 00:57:43.76
What do you think he did with this money?

1282
00:57:43.76 --> 00:57:44.76
It's meant to.

1283
00:57:44.76 --> 00:57:45.76
Yeah.

1284
00:57:45.76 --> 00:57:47.76
He bought car and whatever.

1285
00:57:47.76 --> 00:57:48.76
That 10, 10.

1286
00:57:48.76 --> 00:57:53.72
And you know, like it's a dated girls and went to bars and went out for nice dinners.

1287
00:57:53.72 --> 00:57:56.36
And did that for a long time.

1288
00:57:56.36 --> 00:58:00.20
And so my dad says, hey, you know, they're talking about it.

1289
00:58:00.20 --> 00:58:04.92
He says, well, you know, this is the last year that I'm getting my monthly payments for

1290
00:58:04.92 --> 00:58:06.92
winning the lottery.

1291
00:58:06.92 --> 00:58:13.04
My dad says, what are you going to do when the payments aren't coming anymore?

1292
00:58:13.04 --> 00:58:15.08
And he says, I'm going to win again.

1293
00:58:15.08 --> 00:58:22.04
So yeah, that's planning in a sense.

1294
00:58:22.04 --> 00:58:23.04
Kind of.

1295
00:58:23.04 --> 00:58:25.04
And no, it's not.

1296
00:58:25.04 --> 00:58:33.12
Oh, this is, but man, that's one of the, but that tends to go like that for lottery winners.

1297
00:58:33.12 --> 00:58:37.16
Yeah, apparently the lottery winning isn't a big, like happiness.

1298
00:58:37.16 --> 00:58:38.36
No, it's bad.

1299
00:58:38.36 --> 00:58:39.36
Yeah.

1300
00:58:39.36 --> 00:58:43.20
It ends up being bad because life is a long, long game.

1301
00:58:43.20 --> 00:58:47.36
No matter how you play it, the long game is the one that shakes out.

1302
00:58:47.36 --> 00:58:51.40
You know, so if you're a player playing the short game, that's why you lose in life.

1303
00:58:51.40 --> 00:58:53.44
If you play the short game all the time.

1304
00:58:53.44 --> 00:58:54.44
Yes.

1305
00:58:54.44 --> 00:58:55.88
And the people who play the long game made it all the time.

1306
00:58:55.88 --> 00:58:56.88
I mean, it was playing it.

1307
00:58:56.88 --> 00:58:58.56
You don't even have to dominate it.

1308
00:58:58.56 --> 00:59:01.08
Although I'm not recommending not trying to dominate.

1309
00:59:01.08 --> 00:59:03.56
I'm not saying trying to dominate.

1310
00:59:03.56 --> 00:59:07.000
Yeah, you could come in shoot second to the last place.

1311
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.68
But if you're playing the game, you're going to be doing good.

1312
00:59:08.68 --> 00:59:13.40
And along with you, when you come in second to last place in the long game, you still just

1313
00:59:13.40 --> 00:59:17.28
beat every single other person that's playing the short game.

1314
00:59:17.28 --> 00:59:18.28
Yep.

1315
00:59:18.28 --> 00:59:19.28
You beat them all.

1316
00:59:19.28 --> 00:59:20.28
Yeah.

1317
00:59:20.28 --> 00:59:21.28
And it's not there.

1318
00:59:21.28 --> 00:59:22.28
And they're over there looking around my gorgeous app.

1319
00:59:22.28 --> 00:59:24.68
Yeah, how is who you're so square to it?

1320
00:59:24.68 --> 00:59:27.12
Yeah, but it's not that complicated.

1321
00:59:27.12 --> 00:59:28.96
You know, I mean, it's not easy.

1322
00:59:28.96 --> 00:59:29.96
It's because it's not easy.

1323
00:59:29.96 --> 00:59:30.96
You're wired to please.

1324
00:59:30.96 --> 00:59:33.40
How do you go deep on this on that last warrior, kid podcast?

1325
00:59:33.40 --> 00:59:34.40
Yeah.

1326
00:59:34.40 --> 00:59:35.40
Oh, yeah.

1327
00:59:35.40 --> 00:59:36.92
This, this, this, this, this short term.

1328
00:59:36.92 --> 00:59:40.04
You need to get over the short term gratification.

1329
00:59:40.04 --> 00:59:41.04
Yeah.

1330
00:59:41.04 --> 00:59:45.92
And that is the one of the biggest lessons a kid can learn is that my actions today

1331
00:59:45.92 --> 00:59:47.56
will affect my future.

1332
00:59:47.56 --> 00:59:48.56
Yeah.

1333
00:59:48.56 --> 00:59:51.44
And it's hard to convince some of that.

1334
00:59:51.44 --> 00:59:52.92
It seems so distant.

1335
00:59:52.92 --> 00:59:53.92
Yep.

1336
00:59:53.92 --> 00:59:58.000
Like the future seems so distant when you're young.

1337
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.48
I always have another discussion with someone who would appear in it.

1338
01:00:02.48 --> 01:00:07.72
And there was a level of frustration that, and it's the typical level of frustration from

1339
01:00:07.72 --> 01:00:11.88
the parent, which was, you know, the kid has a lot of potential, but they're like,

1340
01:00:11.88 --> 01:00:15.72
they're not training the way they should be and not working the way, you know, all that

1341
01:00:15.72 --> 01:00:17.72
stuff.

1342
01:00:17.72 --> 01:00:24.04
And what I tried to explain to the parent was that the potential that you're telling your

1343
01:00:24.04 --> 01:00:30.52
kid that he has, they do not even comprehend what that means.

1344
01:00:30.52 --> 01:00:35.72
It is not a, it is not a, it's not something that they can understand.

1345
01:00:35.72 --> 01:00:37.76
It's completely intangible.

1346
01:00:37.76 --> 01:00:42.68
Like even when you say, oh, if you keep practicing this, you could be the champion.

1347
01:00:42.68 --> 01:00:43.68
Yeah.

1348
01:00:43.68 --> 01:00:48.48
This means you might as well say, if you keep practicing this, he will be, you know,

1349
01:00:48.48 --> 01:00:49.80
you're not able to do that.

1350
01:00:49.80 --> 01:00:50.80
Yeah.

1351
01:00:50.80 --> 01:00:51.80
It means nothing to them.

1352
01:00:51.80 --> 01:00:52.80
Yeah.

1353
01:00:52.80 --> 01:00:53.80
And so yes, you try to convince them.

1354
01:00:53.80 --> 01:00:55.64
You try and explain it to them.

1355
01:00:55.64 --> 01:01:01.44
But what I recommend is instead of trying to explain to them this massive concept of what

1356
01:01:01.44 --> 01:01:07.24
their potential is, you try and give them some short term rewards that lead them in the

1357
01:01:07.24 --> 01:01:13.92
right direction that are, are supportive of the long game, but they're easier mental connections

1358
01:01:13.92 --> 01:01:14.92
for the kid.

1359
01:01:14.92 --> 01:01:18.56
And this is the same thing applies to employees as well, right?

1360
01:01:18.56 --> 01:01:20.56
You know, you get a young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young,

1361
01:01:20.56 --> 01:01:22.60
employees as well, right?

1362
01:01:22.60 --> 01:01:25.72
You know, you get a young, young employee that's, you know, they're not thinking they

1363
01:01:25.72 --> 01:01:29.20
could be the regional manager, right?

1364
01:01:29.20 --> 01:01:31.60
They're just thinking they're just happy to be here.

1365
01:01:31.60 --> 01:01:34.44
But you're, you're looking at what I'm going to ask, you know, this is sharp kid.

1366
01:01:34.44 --> 01:01:35.44
Could be could.

1367
01:01:35.44 --> 01:01:40.48
So you might not say, look, one day you're going to be the regional manager in 22 years.

1368
01:01:40.48 --> 01:01:41.48
Think about that.

1369
01:01:41.48 --> 01:01:44.48
When you, you, somebody gets hired on as whatever.

1370
01:01:44.48 --> 01:01:48.60
And you say, one day, you're, you could be the regional manager and you could make whatever.

1371
01:01:48.60 --> 01:01:50.000
This big chunk of money.

1372
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
You're looking at you going, you're going to be here to, you know, I'm, I'm going to have

1373
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.24
this job for six months, whatever.

1374
01:01:54.24 --> 01:01:55.24
Yeah.

1375
01:01:55.24 --> 01:01:58.52
So what you want to do is just tie something a little bit closer to them to their reality.

1376
01:01:58.52 --> 01:01:59.52
Yeah.

1377
01:01:59.52 --> 01:02:03.64
Of, hey, here's where you could get a, here's where the bonus program works here.

1378
01:02:03.64 --> 01:02:04.64
Have you seen this?

1379
01:02:04.64 --> 01:02:05.64
You can make an extra, whatever.

1380
01:02:05.64 --> 01:02:06.64
Yeah.

1381
01:02:06.64 --> 01:02:10.04
And it's going to move them in the right direction, the long game, but they can comprehend

1382
01:02:10.04 --> 01:02:11.04
it immediately.

1383
01:02:11.04 --> 01:02:12.04
Yeah.

1384
01:02:12.04 --> 01:02:13.04
That's my recommendation.

1385
01:02:13.04 --> 01:02:19.20
Should even just compliments and encouragement are good, little micro rewards for those

1386
01:02:19.20 --> 01:02:21.96
short term like, so I think you're my kids.

1387
01:02:21.96 --> 01:02:23.44
Once again, we can't abuse them.

1388
01:02:23.44 --> 01:02:24.44
Yeah.

1389
01:02:24.44 --> 01:02:26.96
You have to abuse, you know, friendlyness with our children.

1390
01:02:26.96 --> 01:02:30.24
We can't abuse, that means that's not the right way.

1391
01:02:30.24 --> 01:02:31.24
Not the right way.

1392
01:02:31.24 --> 01:02:33.44
We can't abuse cheerleading.

1393
01:02:33.44 --> 01:02:34.44
Yeah.

1394
01:02:34.44 --> 01:02:35.44
Right.

1395
01:02:35.44 --> 01:02:37.84
We can abuse cheerleading with our kids and everything that they do is beautiful.

1396
01:02:37.84 --> 01:02:38.84
Right.

1397
01:02:38.84 --> 01:02:40.12
No, that's as beautiful.

1398
01:02:40.12 --> 01:02:41.12
Yeah.

1399
01:02:41.12 --> 01:02:43.08
A piece of art that you just created.

1400
01:02:43.08 --> 01:02:44.48
What is it?

1401
01:02:44.48 --> 01:02:45.48
Beautiful.

1402
01:02:45.48 --> 01:02:46.48
Whatever it is.

1403
01:02:46.48 --> 01:02:47.48
Yeah.

1404
01:02:47.48 --> 01:02:48.48
No.

1405
01:02:48.48 --> 01:02:51.000
That's not good.

1406
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Yeah.

1407
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.64
That's not good.

1408
01:02:53.64 --> 01:02:56.24
But you're just talking about abuse and the other thing is the other thing you have

1409
01:02:56.24 --> 01:03:03.28
to be careful with is, you're telling your kid like, well, you're special.

1410
01:03:03.28 --> 01:03:05.52
Or you're so perfect.

1411
01:03:05.52 --> 01:03:06.52
Right.

1412
01:03:06.52 --> 01:03:07.52
You know.

1413
01:03:07.52 --> 01:03:08.52
And so you know.

1414
01:03:08.52 --> 01:03:09.52
Yeah.

1415
01:03:09.52 --> 01:03:10.52
So this can get better.

1416
01:03:10.52 --> 01:03:11.52
Yeah.

1417
01:03:11.52 --> 01:03:12.52
You're marginal.

1418
01:03:12.52 --> 01:03:13.52
That's.

1419
01:03:13.52 --> 01:03:14.52
No, that.

1420
01:03:14.52 --> 01:03:15.52
No.

1421
01:03:15.52 --> 01:03:19.76
Yeah. and what I mean encouragement and in compliments.

1422
01:03:19.76 --> 01:03:22.64
It's like if they do something good, you compliment that good thing.

1423
01:03:22.64 --> 01:03:23.64
That's essentially it.

1424
01:03:23.64 --> 01:03:27.000
And yeah, like anything, you can throw out too many.

1425
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.32
And you can throw out too little really because the fulfillment or satisfaction of receiving

1426
01:03:31.32 --> 01:03:33.96
that compliment isn't big enough for the work that they just did.

1427
01:03:33.96 --> 01:03:36.28
Like man, I don't want to do those 100.

1428
01:03:36.28 --> 01:03:40.40
I'm proud of my daughter to 90 burpees the other day.

1429
01:03:40.40 --> 01:03:41.40
Why 90?

1430
01:03:41.40 --> 01:03:42.80
Did you just want to withhold?

1431
01:03:42.80 --> 01:03:43.80
No, I'm working on the century.

1432
01:03:43.80 --> 01:03:44.80
I'm working on the four.

1433
01:03:44.80 --> 01:03:49.04
I'm trying to get to 90 and say hey dad, you do whatever you want.

1434
01:03:49.04 --> 01:03:50.04
I'm getting 10 more.

1435
01:03:50.04 --> 01:03:51.04
Watch this.

1436
01:03:51.04 --> 01:03:52.04
I'm getting to a hundough.

1437
01:03:52.04 --> 01:03:53.04
Well, he was the thing.

1438
01:03:53.04 --> 01:03:55.12
She's done that before, but not with 90.

1439
01:03:55.12 --> 01:03:56.12
So I'm working her up.

1440
01:03:56.12 --> 01:03:58.52
I started from like, I was like, hey, when she was real soon.

1441
01:03:58.52 --> 01:03:59.52
One more time.

1442
01:03:59.52 --> 01:04:01.36
I didn't time it.

1443
01:04:01.36 --> 01:04:03.04
How are we going to recognize improvement?

1444
01:04:03.04 --> 01:04:04.56
Because we're going to get to the number first.

1445
01:04:04.56 --> 01:04:05.56
Then we go for a time.

1446
01:04:05.56 --> 01:04:06.56
Got it.

1447
01:04:06.56 --> 01:04:07.56
So I mean, that's the story.

1448
01:04:07.56 --> 01:04:09.52
I mean, it's not like, you know, my life's mission.

1449
01:04:09.52 --> 01:04:10.52
Of course.

1450
01:04:10.52 --> 01:04:12.36
It's just a fun little thing that I do.

1451
01:04:12.36 --> 01:04:13.36
But if.

1452
01:04:13.36 --> 01:04:15.24
If sounds fun.

1453
01:04:15.24 --> 01:04:15.84
Yeah, wonderful.

1454
01:04:15.84 --> 01:04:17.04
Sure.

1455
01:04:17.04 --> 01:04:21.88
But so if I'm like, hey, you're super strong.

1456
01:04:21.88 --> 01:04:24.84
They like that or my kids like that when you call them strong.

1457
01:04:24.84 --> 01:04:28.04
So every time they do something like exercise or something like that,

1458
01:04:28.04 --> 01:04:30.64
they do a good workout or whatever.

1459
01:04:30.64 --> 01:04:35.36
I'll say how strong they are or how strong they're looking or being or whatever.

1460
01:04:35.36 --> 01:04:40.16
But if that feeling isn't enough to constitute that super hard,

1461
01:04:40.16 --> 01:04:42.52
we're like if I over push them like I 90,

1462
01:04:42.52 --> 01:04:44.64
given where we are with burpees with her.

1463
01:04:46.96 --> 01:04:47.64
She's not raised.

1464
01:04:47.64 --> 01:04:50.24
She wasn't ready for 90 at this time.

1465
01:04:50.24 --> 01:04:51.40
So did you cry?

1466
01:04:51.40 --> 01:04:52.88
No, she didn't cry.

1467
01:04:52.88 --> 01:04:53.56
Thankfully.

1468
01:04:53.56 --> 01:04:54.40
She'll cry.

1469
01:04:54.40 --> 01:04:54.92
No shame.

1470
01:04:54.92 --> 01:04:55.76
She'll cry.

1471
01:04:55.76 --> 01:04:59.36
I went for a run with my youngest daughter.

1472
01:04:59.36 --> 01:05:00.80
This is a while ago.

1473
01:05:00.80 --> 01:05:02.44
I don't know how old she was at the time.

1474
01:05:02.44 --> 01:05:04.76
But I was like, OK, we're going to start running.

1475
01:05:04.76 --> 01:05:08.20
Because I want to improve for my all time at the school.

1476
01:05:08.20 --> 01:05:10.000
I said, OK, you want to improve that my all time.

1477
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.92
I know how to do it.

1478
01:05:11.92 --> 01:05:14.36
Here we go.

1479
01:05:14.36 --> 01:05:17.44
So her mile time was weak.

1480
01:05:17.44 --> 01:05:18.76
And I said, we can get it better.

1481
01:05:18.76 --> 01:05:22.52
So the first run we went on, I'm not kidding.

1482
01:05:22.52 --> 01:05:27.56
She, by the time we got one minute deep,

1483
01:05:27.56 --> 01:05:31.000
she had tears welling up in her eyes.

1484
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.80
And I said, hey, just keep going.

1485
01:05:34.80 --> 01:05:41.40
But the point of saying this is when I try

1486
01:05:41.40 --> 01:05:44.12
to give children, especially my children or any children

1487
01:05:44.12 --> 01:05:48.36
compliments, I try and compliment their hard work.

1488
01:05:48.36 --> 01:05:52.44
As opposed to your strong or your smart, what I say is,

1489
01:05:52.44 --> 01:05:55.80
you really worked hard for that and look at this great result.

1490
01:05:55.80 --> 01:05:58.92
Because what it makes them realize is that great results

1491
01:05:58.92 --> 01:06:00.48
come from hard work and guess what?

1492
01:06:00.48 --> 01:06:01.80
That is the truth.

1493
01:06:01.80 --> 01:06:04.84
Because we all know people that were incredibly smart,

1494
01:06:04.84 --> 01:06:06.84
incredibly strong, incredibly talented,

1495
01:06:06.84 --> 01:06:09.12
incredibly gifted, and they didn't do anything with any of those

1496
01:06:09.12 --> 01:06:09.32
things.

1497
01:06:09.32 --> 01:06:12.28
Because they didn't understand that they had to work hard.

1498
01:06:12.28 --> 01:06:14.28
Even if you have all that skill, if you don't work hard,

1499
01:06:14.28 --> 01:06:15.16
you're not going to get anywhere.

1500
01:06:15.16 --> 01:06:17.04
Yeah, dang that's a good little.

1501
01:06:17.04 --> 01:06:22.08
So lean towards complimenting the hard work.

1502
01:06:22.08 --> 01:06:24.12
And that's what you really want to see.

1503
01:06:24.12 --> 01:06:25.04
Let's face it.

1504
01:06:25.04 --> 01:06:26.36
Let me ask you this.

1505
01:06:26.36 --> 01:06:28.52
And this is a tough question.

1506
01:06:28.52 --> 01:06:32.04
Would you rather have someone on your team

1507
01:06:32.04 --> 01:06:36.24
that is extremely talented or extremely hard worker?

1508
01:06:36.24 --> 01:06:37.36
Of course, it's easy.

1509
01:06:37.36 --> 01:06:39.04
We all want to say, well, I take the talent

1510
01:06:39.04 --> 01:06:40.56
because we can make the person work hard,

1511
01:06:40.56 --> 01:06:42.40
but that's actually not true.

1512
01:06:42.40 --> 01:06:43.56
That's the same thing.

1513
01:06:43.56 --> 01:06:46.84
And the real talent, the best talent,

1514
01:06:46.84 --> 01:06:49.64
really is you get someone that just knows how to grind

1515
01:06:49.64 --> 01:06:51.16
and work hard.

1516
01:06:51.16 --> 01:06:52.88
Like that's good.

1517
01:06:52.88 --> 01:06:54.84
And that's going to be much more valuable

1518
01:06:54.84 --> 01:06:57.08
than hey, this person's super smart

1519
01:06:57.08 --> 01:06:59.08
or hey, this person's super strong.

1520
01:06:59.08 --> 01:07:04.08
Occasionally, you get someone like GSP, George St. Pierre,

1521
01:07:04.08 --> 01:07:09.08
who was way talented in multiple modalities

1522
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.04
and was a hard worker.

1523
01:07:13.04 --> 01:07:14.52
You know what that person becomes?

1524
01:07:14.52 --> 01:07:15.68
A world champion.

1525
01:07:15.68 --> 01:07:17.000
Yeah.

1526
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.32
Sometimes you get a world champion

1527
01:07:18.32 --> 01:07:20.000
that's just there because of hard work.

1528
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Sometimes you get a world champion.

1529
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.80
That's just there because of talent.

1530
01:07:22.80 --> 01:07:24.32
Occasionally, you get someone that's both

1531
01:07:24.32 --> 01:07:26.04
and they're usually sort of a,

1532
01:07:26.04 --> 01:07:28.20
just there more dominant, like a dominant.

1533
01:07:28.20 --> 01:07:30.32
Yeah, that's true.

1534
01:07:30.32 --> 01:07:31.16
And that's good.

1535
01:07:31.16 --> 01:07:34.68
So I started to compliment the hard work.

1536
01:07:34.68 --> 01:07:37.80
I personally like both, I like to,

1537
01:07:37.80 --> 01:07:40.76
especially with my son like being strong and stuff,

1538
01:07:40.76 --> 01:07:42.08
he really likes that.

1539
01:07:42.08 --> 01:07:45.36
So he'll, it's to the point where if you help him do something,

1540
01:07:45.36 --> 01:07:46.20
he'll get mad at you.

1541
01:07:46.20 --> 01:07:47.20
You kind of get mad at you.

1542
01:07:47.20 --> 01:07:48.56
Yeah, which I kind of like,

1543
01:07:48.56 --> 01:07:50.48
I don't know where that's going to lead, you know,

1544
01:07:50.48 --> 01:07:52.56
but I like that currently.

1545
01:07:52.56 --> 01:07:55.28
So he has that sense of pride.

1546
01:07:55.28 --> 01:07:56.76
We're being strong is a good,

1547
01:07:56.76 --> 01:07:58.80
yeah, no, that's nothing wrong with that.

1548
01:07:58.80 --> 01:08:01.64
So yeah, but man, if you add the hard work part of it,

1549
01:08:01.64 --> 01:08:03.68
because being strong is essentially a result,

1550
01:08:03.68 --> 01:08:06.52
you know, and he doesn't obviously is too.

1551
01:08:06.52 --> 01:08:08.04
Yeah, it's really going to be easy connection

1552
01:08:08.04 --> 01:08:10.32
if you'd make because it's, hey, you're strong

1553
01:08:10.32 --> 01:08:11.56
and that's because you work hard.

1554
01:08:11.56 --> 01:08:12.68
Yeah.

1555
01:08:12.68 --> 01:08:13.96
Because many of you say you're strong

1556
01:08:13.96 --> 01:08:15.80
because you got just changed.

1557
01:08:15.80 --> 01:08:16.64
Cool.

1558
01:08:16.64 --> 01:08:17.68
All those besit over here, be strong.

1559
01:08:17.68 --> 01:08:18.68
You're strong.

1560
01:08:18.68 --> 01:08:19.68
You're strong.

1561
01:08:19.68 --> 01:08:20.52
That's true.

1562
01:08:20.52 --> 01:08:21.36
What do you got?

1563
01:08:21.36 --> 01:08:22.20
Yeah, it's true.

1564
01:08:22.20 --> 01:08:24.64
And when you, especially if you don't recognize

1565
01:08:24.64 --> 01:08:26.28
the hard work part of it, you know,

1566
01:08:26.28 --> 01:08:28.16
and you just think you, as a kid,

1567
01:08:28.16 --> 01:08:29.48
you're just rolling around strong.

1568
01:08:29.48 --> 01:08:32.48
You're, you're basically you've reveled in the results

1569
01:08:32.48 --> 01:08:35.000
for so long where it's now when it's hard work time.

1570
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.92
It's kind of like, wait, I'm not used to that part of this.

1571
01:08:36.92 --> 01:08:38.72
So they say that can happen to,

1572
01:08:38.72 --> 01:08:42.04
they call them gazelles in buds.

1573
01:08:42.04 --> 01:08:44.68
These are people that like really fast good athletes.

1574
01:08:44.68 --> 01:08:46.68
And, but they never lost before.

1575
01:08:46.68 --> 01:08:47.52
Yeah.

1576
01:08:47.52 --> 01:08:48.84
And if they start getting beat down,

1577
01:08:48.84 --> 01:08:50.28
which you do get beat down,

1578
01:08:50.28 --> 01:08:52.24
and they lose, they can't handle it mentally.

1579
01:08:52.24 --> 01:08:53.08
Yeah.

1580
01:08:53.08 --> 01:08:53.92
Oh yeah.

1581
01:08:53.92 --> 01:08:57.88
So yes, sir, that is, that's real.

1582
01:08:57.88 --> 01:08:58.72
Next question.

1583
01:08:58.72 --> 01:09:01.64
Jocelyn, my wife told me that she sees,

1584
01:09:01.64 --> 01:09:05.76
I am much more direct and less cordial than I used to be.

1585
01:09:05.76 --> 01:09:08.52
I feel I've pushed too much into getting after it.

1586
01:09:08.52 --> 01:09:13.76
And it makes those around me feel like I changed

1587
01:09:13.76 --> 01:09:15.08
to someone else.

1588
01:09:15.08 --> 01:09:18.76
Yeah, we have to be really careful, right?

1589
01:09:18.76 --> 01:09:23.52
Because being more direct at less cordial

1590
01:09:23.52 --> 01:09:25.92
is definitely not getting after it.

1591
01:09:25.92 --> 01:09:28.16
In fact, it's the opposite.

1592
01:09:28.16 --> 01:09:32.48
If you are getting after it in a correct manner,

1593
01:09:32.48 --> 01:09:36.04
your wife should be completely stoked

1594
01:09:36.04 --> 01:09:38.60
because you're gonna have more time for her

1595
01:09:38.60 --> 01:09:41.88
because you're gonna be doing time management properly.

1596
01:09:41.88 --> 01:09:43.08
You're gonna have,

1597
01:09:43.08 --> 01:09:44.96
you're gonna be doing better at work,

1598
01:09:44.96 --> 01:09:46.84
which means you're gonna be getting promoted

1599
01:09:46.84 --> 01:09:49.56
or whatever, getting paid more or getting jobs

1600
01:09:49.56 --> 01:09:51.92
to build your whatever something like that.

1601
01:09:51.92 --> 01:09:53.60
You're gonna be healthier

1602
01:09:53.60 --> 01:09:55.000
because you're working out,

1603
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.88
you're gonna be stronger because you're working out.

1604
01:09:56.88 --> 01:09:59.52
You're gonna be more organized with things

1605
01:10:01.24 --> 01:10:03.28
and you're gonna be more thoughtful about building.

1606
01:10:03.28 --> 01:10:04.56
That's what it getting after.

1607
01:10:04.56 --> 01:10:06.92
Like your relationship should be improving.

1608
01:10:06.92 --> 01:10:07.76
Yes.

1609
01:10:08.88 --> 01:10:13.56
And this is one of the echo Charles's favorite things

1610
01:10:13.56 --> 01:10:14.40
to talk about.

1611
01:10:14.40 --> 01:10:15.96
It's actually something that you've just brought up

1612
01:10:15.96 --> 01:10:17.24
a bunch of times on the podcast,

1613
01:10:17.24 --> 01:10:19.44
which is when someone says,

1614
01:10:19.44 --> 01:10:21.48
no, that's just how I am.

1615
01:10:21.48 --> 01:10:22.68
Like, you know what echo?

1616
01:10:22.68 --> 01:10:23.56
I'm just gonna tell you the truth

1617
01:10:23.56 --> 01:10:24.84
is that's just how I am.

1618
01:10:24.84 --> 01:10:26.72
Just making an excuse for being a jerk

1619
01:10:26.72 --> 01:10:28.60
coming out of the gate, which is not good.

1620
01:10:28.60 --> 01:10:30.64
So if that's what you're doing with your wife,

1621
01:10:30.64 --> 01:10:31.48
you know what?

1622
01:10:31.48 --> 01:10:32.36
I'm just gonna get after it.

1623
01:10:32.36 --> 01:10:35.08
Hey, this tune of casserole sucks.

1624
01:10:36.48 --> 01:10:38.64
I'm just telling you what it is.

1625
01:10:38.64 --> 01:10:39.88
That's how I roll.

1626
01:10:39.88 --> 01:10:42.24
Like no, you're actually rolling in the wrong direction.

1627
01:10:43.36 --> 01:10:45.92
When you're getting after it in a good way,

1628
01:10:45.92 --> 01:10:47.32
your wife will be stoked.

1629
01:10:47.32 --> 01:10:49.28
I was getting interviewed the other day.

1630
01:10:50.24 --> 01:10:52.24
And I realized this.

1631
01:10:52.24 --> 01:10:54.80
So I've written eight books.

1632
01:10:54.80 --> 01:10:57.80
The eight one comes out in January of 2020.

1633
01:10:57.80 --> 01:10:59.08
It's a lot of writing.

1634
01:11:00.52 --> 01:11:04.56
I wrote 90% of the words in those books

1635
01:11:05.56 --> 01:11:07.36
while my family was asleep.

1636
01:11:09.52 --> 01:11:14.52
Then it made almost no impact on the family.

1637
01:11:14.92 --> 01:11:17.24
I'm writing these books.

1638
01:11:17.24 --> 01:11:18.24
Editing is a little bit different

1639
01:11:18.24 --> 01:11:19.16
because there's a timeline on it.

1640
01:11:19.16 --> 01:11:21.04
And I think sometimes my family would be a wake

1641
01:11:21.04 --> 01:11:23.84
while I was editing and I had to get stuff turned back in.

1642
01:11:23.84 --> 01:11:25.08
And it's a pain.

1643
01:11:25.08 --> 01:11:27.36
But that's like a takes a week, right?

1644
01:11:27.36 --> 01:11:31.12
But the other 90% of getting after it

1645
01:11:32.44 --> 01:11:35.16
was done while my family is asleep.

1646
01:11:36.76 --> 01:11:37.92
If you,

1647
01:11:37.92 --> 01:11:39.88
concretarily, are getting after it

1648
01:11:39.88 --> 01:11:42.68
at the expense of your family in friends,

1649
01:11:42.68 --> 01:11:44.92
that's not, that's actually being selfish.

1650
01:11:47.16 --> 01:11:48.20
So that's one part.

1651
01:11:48.20 --> 01:11:50.68
Okay, so maybe you need to check yourself there

1652
01:11:50.68 --> 01:11:51.64
and make sure that you're,

1653
01:11:51.64 --> 01:11:53.08
got your priorities in order.

1654
01:11:54.64 --> 01:11:57.52
There is a chance, however,

1655
01:11:57.52 --> 01:12:03.72
that your friends don't like seeing you start to

1656
01:12:04.84 --> 01:12:07.000
get some altitude, right?

1657
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.92
Start to be more successful,

1658
01:12:08.92 --> 01:12:10.24
start to lead a better life.

1659
01:12:10.24 --> 01:12:12.20
There's all kinds of groups of people

1660
01:12:12.20 --> 01:12:14.52
that will just drag you back down.

1661
01:12:14.52 --> 01:12:16.24
They don't want to see you in.

1662
01:12:16.24 --> 01:12:18.24
That's sort of, I don't know,

1663
01:12:18.24 --> 01:12:20.48
is that the fundamental kind of baseline

1664
01:12:20.48 --> 01:12:23.20
human instinct I don't want to see you in.

1665
01:12:24.64 --> 01:12:26.84
If there is an element of it to,

1666
01:12:26.84 --> 01:12:29.44
to, I would not be surprised.

1667
01:12:29.44 --> 01:12:30.84
Put it that way, but I don't know.

1668
01:12:30.84 --> 01:12:34.72
There's at least a non-trivial part

1669
01:12:34.72 --> 01:12:39.72
of the population that does not want to see you in.

1670
01:12:40.72 --> 01:12:42.88
There's at least a percentage,

1671
01:12:42.88 --> 01:12:44.40
whatever that percentage is,

1672
01:12:44.40 --> 01:12:46.32
of the people that you know

1673
01:12:46.32 --> 01:12:48.44
that does not want to see you in,

1674
01:12:48.44 --> 01:12:51.48
they would rather see you fail.

1675
01:12:51.48 --> 01:12:53.36
They would rather, and maybe fails not the word,

1676
01:12:53.36 --> 01:12:56.28
but they would at least rather have you stay with them.

1677
01:12:56.28 --> 01:12:57.36
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1678
01:12:57.36 --> 01:12:59.20
That makes sense, really.

1679
01:12:59.20 --> 01:13:01.84
So there's a chance that that's going on.

1680
01:13:01.84 --> 01:13:05.000
Is there a chance that that's going on with your wife?

1681
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.36
Hopefully not, that's a slim chance,

1682
01:13:07.36 --> 01:13:08.40
because if you think about it,

1683
01:13:08.40 --> 01:13:11.48
your success, her success is predicated on your success.

1684
01:13:11.48 --> 01:13:13.76
I mean, you are bound to each other,

1685
01:13:13.76 --> 01:13:16.72
both each of your success is predicated

1686
01:13:16.72 --> 01:13:18.20
on each other's success.

1687
01:13:18.20 --> 01:13:21.20
So do I want my wife to be successful?

1688
01:13:21.20 --> 01:13:24.36
Oh yeah, because that's my wife.

1689
01:13:25.48 --> 01:13:27.60
And she's looking me going, yes, go be successful.

1690
01:13:27.60 --> 01:13:31.20
The more successful I am, the more successful she is.

1691
01:13:31.20 --> 01:13:36.20
So there's most likely your wife, in my opinion,

1692
01:13:36.52 --> 01:13:38.84
would be supportive of your efforts,

1693
01:13:38.84 --> 01:13:41.04
unless you're just to get out of control.

1694
01:13:41.04 --> 01:13:42.92
There's a chance, I guess,

1695
01:13:42.92 --> 01:13:47.28
that a wife could see someone change,

1696
01:13:47.28 --> 01:13:50.80
and that's not the person that I married, right?

1697
01:13:50.80 --> 01:13:54.20
But hold on, the person that you married was lazy.

1698
01:13:54.20 --> 01:13:56.12
And I'm over here getting after it.

1699
01:13:56.12 --> 01:13:58.68
The person that you married was making X amount of money,

1700
01:13:58.68 --> 01:14:01.44
and I'm making a lot more than that.

1701
01:14:01.44 --> 01:14:03.44
The person that you married was in a good physical shape.

1702
01:14:03.44 --> 01:14:04.88
I'm in good physical shape.

1703
01:14:06.60 --> 01:14:08.64
Most of the time, the wife would say,

1704
01:14:08.64 --> 01:14:10.28
cool, yeah, I'm getting a better deal now.

1705
01:14:10.28 --> 01:14:13.28
Occasionally, I think, you would get a spouse,

1706
01:14:13.28 --> 01:14:15.68
I guess, could be the male or the female,

1707
01:14:15.68 --> 01:14:17.24
could happen on either side.

1708
01:14:17.24 --> 01:14:19.08
That goes, oh, you want to work hard,

1709
01:14:19.08 --> 01:14:20.24
and I'm really not looking to do that.

1710
01:14:20.24 --> 01:14:21.76
I was comfortable, right?

1711
01:14:21.76 --> 01:14:23.48
I was comfortable, that's it.

1712
01:14:23.48 --> 01:14:24.40
I'm comfortable.

1713
01:14:24.40 --> 01:14:25.88
I don't want you getting all crazy.

1714
01:14:25.88 --> 01:14:27.48
I'm over here being comfortable.

1715
01:14:27.48 --> 01:14:29.48
So that could happen.

1716
01:14:29.48 --> 01:14:30.88
I think that's unlikely.

1717
01:14:30.88 --> 01:14:32.96
I think what's most likely is,

1718
01:14:32.96 --> 01:14:36.36
you are focused on yourself a little bit too much.

1719
01:14:36.36 --> 01:14:37.76
Check yourself for that.

1720
01:14:37.76 --> 01:14:39.24
That should be the first person you look at.

1721
01:14:39.24 --> 01:14:40.08
You.

1722
01:14:40.08 --> 01:14:41.72
Yeah, that's true, huh?

1723
01:14:41.72 --> 01:14:43.92
Because like, this is actually kind of common,

1724
01:14:43.92 --> 01:14:47.64
where husband, wife, whichever the scenario is,

1725
01:14:47.64 --> 01:14:49.72
where one, let's say, let's say two people,

1726
01:14:49.72 --> 01:14:50.72
they get married, whatever,

1727
01:14:50.72 --> 01:14:54.32
years down the road, one of the people in the couple,

1728
01:14:54.32 --> 01:14:57.32
relationship improves himself a lot too.

1729
01:14:57.32 --> 01:14:58.84
Loses a bunch of weight.

1730
01:14:58.84 --> 01:15:01.92
They're literally by their own standard.

1731
01:15:01.92 --> 01:15:04.16
They were not very attractive when they got married,

1732
01:15:04.16 --> 01:15:05.44
but now this is 10 years later,

1733
01:15:05.44 --> 01:15:08.76
whatever they become straight up attractive now.

1734
01:15:08.76 --> 01:15:11.92
Making more money, more people want to hang out with them

1735
01:15:11.92 --> 01:15:14.48
because they're nicer like all this stuff, straight up,

1736
01:15:14.48 --> 01:15:16.68
across the board improvement,

1737
01:15:16.68 --> 01:15:19.84
meanwhile the other person in the relationship didn't do that.

1738
01:15:19.84 --> 01:15:22.000
Still married, still all good, no,

1739
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.72
infidel, nothing like that.

1740
01:15:23.72 --> 01:15:26.52
Still married, but that person who didn't improve themselves

1741
01:15:26.52 --> 01:15:28.40
will feel like they got phased out

1742
01:15:28.40 --> 01:15:31.000
or kind of like the person might want to upgrade

1743
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.76
or something like that.

1744
01:15:32.76 --> 01:15:35.52
So it's like, it's a positive they try and drag the person back down.

1745
01:15:35.52 --> 01:15:37.04
Yeah, because you need to be back here,

1746
01:15:37.04 --> 01:15:38.28
I need to be feel secure.

1747
01:15:38.28 --> 01:15:40.76
Now I'm this husband and now my wife's

1748
01:15:40.76 --> 01:15:42.44
I'm not used to a hot wife

1749
01:15:42.44 --> 01:15:44.80
because when we got married, you weren't that hot.

1750
01:15:44.80 --> 01:15:47.52
I loved you for you and all this stuff

1751
01:15:47.52 --> 01:15:49.12
and what they say, whatever.

1752
01:15:49.12 --> 01:15:51.92
And now you're a good person.

1753
01:15:51.92 --> 01:15:52.76
I don't know.

1754
01:15:52.76 --> 01:15:53.92
I don't know.

1755
01:15:53.92 --> 01:15:56.12
I'm thinking of cliche movie thing.

1756
01:15:56.12 --> 01:15:59.28
But anyway, the wife's all good looking now,

1757
01:15:59.28 --> 01:16:01.56
people are like, people at the store,

1758
01:16:01.56 --> 01:16:03.72
like, complimenting her and all this stuff.

1759
01:16:03.72 --> 01:16:04.84
And the guys now used to it.

1760
01:16:04.84 --> 01:16:07.36
And now in his mind, a little thing develops

1761
01:16:07.36 --> 01:16:09.64
or it's like, oh, I'm not good enough now

1762
01:16:09.64 --> 01:16:11.12
for this hot girl.

1763
01:16:11.12 --> 01:16:12.84
And I'm going to buy her some cheetos.

1764
01:16:12.84 --> 01:16:14.40
Yeah, bring her back down.

1765
01:16:14.40 --> 01:16:17.08
So like at least have some manager boom

1766
01:16:17.08 --> 01:16:18.96
out of control.

1767
01:16:18.96 --> 01:16:19.80
Yeah.

1768
01:16:19.80 --> 01:16:22.88
This person, that's not an uncommon thing.

1769
01:16:22.88 --> 01:16:24.88
In that specific scenario, I guess that scenario

1770
01:16:24.88 --> 01:16:26.64
is not very common though.

1771
01:16:26.64 --> 01:16:28.04
It's not very common scenario.

1772
01:16:28.04 --> 01:16:30.32
And then it would have to be doubly uncommon

1773
01:16:30.32 --> 01:16:32.12
for someone to actually want to drag them back down.

1774
01:16:32.12 --> 01:16:33.08
I have to throw it out there

1775
01:16:33.08 --> 01:16:34.16
because it is a possibility.

1776
01:16:34.16 --> 01:16:34.84
Yeah.

1777
01:16:34.84 --> 01:16:37.08
But for this particular question, I don't think so.

1778
01:16:37.08 --> 01:16:39.60
Only because this little indicator right here,

1779
01:16:39.60 --> 01:16:44.60
my wife told me that she sees I am much more direct.

1780
01:16:44.80 --> 01:16:47.88
And usually much more direct means insensitive

1781
01:16:47.88 --> 01:16:49.56
in my experience.

1782
01:16:49.56 --> 01:16:49.76
Why?

1783
01:16:49.76 --> 01:16:50.60
It's don't do good.

1784
01:16:50.60 --> 01:16:53.32
Generally speaking, within sensitivity.

1785
01:16:53.32 --> 01:16:54.84
Less cordial.

1786
01:16:54.84 --> 01:16:55.68
That's another one.

1787
01:16:55.68 --> 01:16:58.44
In my opinion, in my experience, because I'm married.

1788
01:16:58.44 --> 01:16:59.68
Yeah, that's cordial.

1789
01:16:59.68 --> 01:17:01.68
You learn things.

1790
01:17:01.68 --> 01:17:02.88
I'm going to give you an example.

1791
01:17:02.88 --> 01:17:06.24
Something I learned about my wife.

1792
01:17:06.24 --> 01:17:09.56
If my wife, if it isn't on the schedule,

1793
01:17:09.56 --> 01:17:12.60
it's about enough to make my wife get mad.

1794
01:17:12.60 --> 01:17:15.000
So in other words, if I said,

1795
01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:20.000
hey, I'm going away for a month from now,

1796
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.40
I'm going away for six months on a work trip.

1797
01:17:24.48 --> 01:17:27.24
I'll be back when I'm done with those six months.

1798
01:17:27.24 --> 01:17:29.72
And when I'm gone, you're not going to be able to hear from me at all.

1799
01:17:29.72 --> 01:17:32.44
She'd be like, okay, got it.

1800
01:17:32.44 --> 01:17:33.60
When do you leave?

1801
01:17:33.60 --> 01:17:35.92
And I'd say, well, I'm leaving whenever.

1802
01:17:35.92 --> 01:17:37.44
September first.

1803
01:17:37.44 --> 01:17:42.44
And she'd go, okay, she wouldn't be even remotely upset.

1804
01:17:42.44 --> 01:17:44.64
She'd be good to go.

1805
01:17:44.64 --> 01:17:47.92
If it was Friday night.

1806
01:17:47.92 --> 01:17:53.32
And I came home and said, oh, I didn't tell you or Saturday night.

1807
01:17:53.32 --> 01:17:55.16
I said, I didn't tell you, but I'm going over to Echos

1808
01:17:55.16 --> 01:17:55.88
to watch the UFC.

1809
01:17:59.08 --> 01:18:03.12
There's a decent chance that she's mad about that.

1810
01:18:03.12 --> 01:18:05.32
Because she had in her mind that we were going to eat.

1811
01:18:05.32 --> 01:18:08.000
Whatever, we were going out for dinner or whatever.

1812
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.24
But I didn't give the pre-plant situation.

1813
01:18:12.24 --> 01:18:14.20
What if she didn't make a plan for that?

1814
01:18:14.20 --> 01:18:16.36
It was just sort of maybe we could do that.

1815
01:18:16.36 --> 01:18:19.72
But it's not on her.

1816
01:18:19.72 --> 01:18:20.56
It's on me.

1817
01:18:20.56 --> 01:18:23.40
It's on me for not informing her of what was going on.

1818
01:18:23.40 --> 01:18:24.84
Because it doesn't really matter.

1819
01:18:24.84 --> 01:18:27.48
All she knew is that I was coming home.

1820
01:18:27.48 --> 01:18:29.64
And I was going to be around and that was what was happening.

1821
01:18:29.64 --> 01:18:30.48
Yeah.

1822
01:18:30.48 --> 01:18:34.04
Because if anything that is not playing, you know what's really funny?

1823
01:18:34.04 --> 01:18:36.08
This is again with my wife.

1824
01:18:36.08 --> 01:18:38.84
And this is where it became evident to me.

1825
01:18:38.84 --> 01:18:43.48
Even if it's something that is positive for my wife,

1826
01:18:43.48 --> 01:18:48.72
if I don't give her pre-planning cycle on what's going to happen.

1827
01:18:48.72 --> 01:18:54.30
So in other words, if I was flying home and I'd been

1828
01:18:54.30 --> 01:18:58.000
gone for a week and I got home and busted through the door

1829
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.36
and said, hey, I'm on a tail end of a 72 hour fast.

1830
01:19:02.36 --> 01:19:03.16
I'm starving.

1831
01:19:03.16 --> 01:19:05.36
I'm taking you out and I made reservations for this.

1832
01:19:05.36 --> 01:19:06.36
Really nice dinner.

1833
01:19:06.36 --> 01:19:11.60
I'm going to go get some, you know, $200 stake right now.

1834
01:19:11.60 --> 01:19:14.68
There's a chance.

1835
01:19:14.68 --> 01:19:20.80
But the percentage should be 100% she's stoked, right?

1836
01:19:20.80 --> 01:19:22.88
That should be the percentage.

1837
01:19:22.88 --> 01:19:30.28
However, with my wife, there's a 20 to 30% chance that she says,

1838
01:19:30.28 --> 01:19:37.64
you know, I was going to take our daughter to the raffle.

1839
01:19:37.64 --> 01:19:38.32
I don't know.

1840
01:19:38.32 --> 01:19:39.32
Play bingo.

1841
01:19:39.32 --> 01:19:41.32
And like that is enough.

1842
01:19:41.32 --> 01:19:42.32
Yeah.

1843
01:19:42.32 --> 01:19:44.80
And what I don't do is I say, oh, cool, you know what?

1844
01:19:44.80 --> 01:19:45.96
We'll go tomorrow.

1845
01:19:45.96 --> 01:19:48.52
What I don't do is try to impose it.

1846
01:19:48.52 --> 01:19:52.76
So what you're saying is like lack of being cordial.

1847
01:19:52.76 --> 01:19:58.08
What I'm saying is that it's not just like that's one example of me not being cordial.

1848
01:19:58.08 --> 01:20:03.96
So I guess I guess to sum it up, my wife doesn't really like surprises.

1849
01:20:03.96 --> 01:20:04.96
Yeah.

1850
01:20:04.96 --> 01:20:06.80
She likes to have a plan.

1851
01:20:06.80 --> 01:20:11.52
She likes to know what's happening and then she'll execute the plan.

1852
01:20:11.52 --> 01:20:13.32
So that's what you got to be careful of.

1853
01:20:13.32 --> 01:20:15.32
You would you got to be, well, not what you got to be careful of.

1854
01:20:15.32 --> 01:20:20.04
That is one example of how these little things they don't make sense.

1855
01:20:20.04 --> 01:20:24.92
It doesn't make sense that my wife wouldn't be super stoked to go out to an awesome

1856
01:20:24.92 --> 01:20:25.92
stake house.

1857
01:20:25.92 --> 01:20:27.64
That doesn't make sense to anyone.

1858
01:20:27.64 --> 01:20:28.64
That's a superficial thing.

1859
01:20:28.64 --> 01:20:35.12
And let me tell you something else that makes it a little bit tricky.

1860
01:20:35.12 --> 01:20:40.96
Is I'm super insensitive to like changing plans.

1861
01:20:40.96 --> 01:20:42.44
People change plans to me, I'm like, whatever.

1862
01:20:42.44 --> 01:20:44.68
It's no, it's literally no factor.

1863
01:20:44.68 --> 01:20:47.68
Like, oh, oh yeah, we've been planning to do this for six months.

1864
01:20:47.68 --> 01:20:48.68
Someone's like, oh, I can't do it.

1865
01:20:48.68 --> 01:20:49.68
I'm like, oh, okay, cool.

1866
01:20:49.68 --> 01:20:50.68
You know what I mean?

1867
01:20:50.68 --> 01:20:51.96
It means nothing to me.

1868
01:20:51.96 --> 01:20:53.40
When things change, it means nothing.

1869
01:20:53.40 --> 01:20:55.64
It has no impact on me.

1870
01:20:55.64 --> 01:21:01.52
I have no emotional reaction to someone saying, hey, this, we can't do this now.

1871
01:21:01.52 --> 01:21:02.52
I'm like, oh, okay, cool.

1872
01:21:02.52 --> 01:21:03.96
I'm going to do something else.

1873
01:21:03.96 --> 01:21:04.96
Yeah.

1874
01:21:04.96 --> 01:21:09.28
So I'm at the other end of the spectrum, which means it took me a little while to figure

1875
01:21:09.28 --> 01:21:13.40
out that, oh, this makes you mad.

1876
01:21:13.40 --> 01:21:14.40
Yeah, got it.

1877
01:21:14.40 --> 01:21:15.40
Yeah.

1878
01:21:15.40 --> 01:21:20.20
And it's probably something like one level, like under the surface, too.

1879
01:21:20.20 --> 01:21:24.92
It's not like, hey, I had this good, you know, the raffle was, was planning in my head.

1880
01:21:24.92 --> 01:21:26.16
And that raffle's important.

1881
01:21:26.16 --> 01:21:27.88
The raffle's not important.

1882
01:21:27.88 --> 01:21:28.88
Neither is the dinner.

1883
01:21:28.88 --> 01:21:32.28
It's like that part of it on that level is not important.

1884
01:21:32.28 --> 01:21:33.56
It's one level deeper.

1885
01:21:33.56 --> 01:21:35.64
It's the fact that I had to sit my head.

1886
01:21:35.64 --> 01:21:37.88
You didn't tell me this other thing.

1887
01:21:37.88 --> 01:21:40.56
And now like what I had in my head really means nothing.

1888
01:21:40.56 --> 01:21:41.56
Yeah.

1889
01:21:41.56 --> 01:21:42.56
So it's kind of that.

1890
01:21:42.56 --> 01:21:46.84
Here's another funny thing about my wife.

1891
01:21:46.84 --> 01:21:54.28
She's so into the planning thing that if I plan something, it has way more value to

1892
01:21:54.28 --> 01:21:55.64
her.

1893
01:21:55.64 --> 01:22:01.52
So in other words, if I say, hey, when I get back this Friday, I'm going to do a fast

1894
01:22:01.52 --> 01:22:03.04
and I'm going to be super hungry.

1895
01:22:03.04 --> 01:22:06.84
I'm going to make reservations for this Friday.

1896
01:22:06.84 --> 01:22:13.40
And we can go out and get an awesome steak, Tom Hawke, rib eye.

1897
01:22:13.40 --> 01:22:18.92
And like the fact that it was pre-planned, like I've done this before, where I've taken

1898
01:22:18.92 --> 01:22:21.88
her and I've gotten reservations.

1899
01:22:21.88 --> 01:22:24.16
And she'll be like, did you make reservations?

1900
01:22:24.16 --> 01:22:26.60
And I'll say, yes, I'm like, yeah, I did.

1901
01:22:26.60 --> 01:22:29.44
And I can see like a little smile.

1902
01:22:29.44 --> 01:22:32.92
Like I care a little bit more that I made those reservations.

1903
01:22:32.92 --> 01:22:35.80
That's what the spontaneity thing?

1904
01:22:35.80 --> 01:22:40.36
No, no, no points for spontaneity.

1905
01:22:40.36 --> 01:22:41.36
Zero.

1906
01:22:41.36 --> 01:22:42.52
Zero points for spontaneity.

1907
01:22:42.52 --> 01:22:45.04
Only points for pre-planned fires.

1908
01:22:45.04 --> 01:22:46.04
You know what?

1909
01:22:46.04 --> 01:22:47.04
Why?

1910
01:22:47.04 --> 01:22:48.04
Because it's thoughtful.

1911
01:22:48.04 --> 01:22:49.04
Yeah, exactly.

1912
01:22:49.04 --> 01:22:50.04
Yes.

1913
01:22:50.04 --> 01:22:51.04
Yes.

1914
01:22:51.04 --> 01:22:52.04
Yeah, that's good.

1915
01:22:52.04 --> 01:22:54.04
That's an interesting quality.

1916
01:22:54.04 --> 01:23:02.28
And I guess my point in saying this, these things, is that everyone has these little

1917
01:23:02.28 --> 01:23:04.44
personality traits.

1918
01:23:04.44 --> 01:23:06.08
People you work with.

1919
01:23:06.08 --> 01:23:08.84
People you're spouse, your children.

1920
01:23:08.84 --> 01:23:10.80
They have these things.

1921
01:23:10.80 --> 01:23:17.48
And if you figure out what those things are, you can actually utilize them to your advantage

1922
01:23:17.48 --> 01:23:22.12
and you can bypass things that will be problematic.

1923
01:23:22.12 --> 01:23:26.48
And something that you've said too is you say, oh, you do this stuff to me, meaning

1924
01:23:26.48 --> 01:23:31.08
Jocco does, I do some like leadership trick to you.

1925
01:23:31.08 --> 01:23:33.56
And you know that I'm doing it.

1926
01:23:33.56 --> 01:23:36.20
But it's still like it works.

1927
01:23:36.20 --> 01:23:39.52
And it still makes you feel the way that you know it's supposed to make you feel.

1928
01:23:39.52 --> 01:23:40.52
That's my point.

1929
01:23:40.52 --> 01:23:43.44
My wife will listen to this.

1930
01:23:43.44 --> 01:23:45.16
And then I'll make reservations.

1931
01:23:45.16 --> 01:23:48.64
And she'll still be here, even though that she knows that I'm doing it just because

1932
01:23:48.64 --> 01:23:51.08
I know that it's going to be something that makes her happy.

1933
01:23:51.08 --> 01:23:52.08
Yeah.

1934
01:23:52.08 --> 01:23:56.000
So just because you reveal like, hey, I know this is what you're like or whether you

1935
01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:02.92
reveal or not doesn't matter when someone has that characteristic, then you can utilize

1936
01:24:02.92 --> 01:24:03.92
that characteristic.

1937
01:24:03.92 --> 01:24:09.88
And I know that's not the best sounding word to talk about like manipulating my wife's

1938
01:24:09.88 --> 01:24:11.68
emotions.

1939
01:24:11.68 --> 01:24:16.24
But what I want to do is manipulate her emotions to make her feel happy about something

1940
01:24:16.24 --> 01:24:17.24
the right way.

1941
01:24:17.24 --> 01:24:18.68
Not necessarily a bad thing.

1942
01:24:18.68 --> 01:24:19.68
Yeah.

1943
01:24:19.68 --> 01:24:20.68
It's a good thing.

1944
01:24:20.68 --> 01:24:26.84
So be cognizant when you're dealing with other human beings.

1945
01:24:26.84 --> 01:24:28.12
Look for these things.

1946
01:24:28.12 --> 01:24:30.76
You see these things if you take a step back.

1947
01:24:30.76 --> 01:24:34.36
If you don't take a step back, you'll never see them.

1948
01:24:34.36 --> 01:24:39.32
If you can't detach, when you tell your wife something and you see that it makes her

1949
01:24:39.32 --> 01:24:43.08
mad, if you can't detach, if you're talking to an employee and you see that they're getting

1950
01:24:43.08 --> 01:24:46.44
frustrated and you can't detach to try to figure out what that is, you're not going to

1951
01:24:46.44 --> 01:24:48.000
make any real progress.

1952
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Yeah.

1953
01:24:51.000 --> 01:25:00.72
So to direct thing, we'd like to be, or when people are direct to us, it makes things easier

1954
01:25:00.72 --> 01:25:02.12
for us, you know, but doesn't.

1955
01:25:02.12 --> 01:25:04.12
It's way, way, way, who's the way we're talking to.

1956
01:25:04.12 --> 01:25:05.12
Whoever people who are.

1957
01:25:05.12 --> 01:25:09.36
Because here's the deal, man.

1958
01:25:09.36 --> 01:25:20.88
The fact is a very, a very blunt force tool and not many people wield it well and not many

1959
01:25:20.88 --> 01:25:22.36
people receive it well.

1960
01:25:22.36 --> 01:25:23.36
Yeah.

1961
01:25:23.36 --> 01:25:26.16
So if you're one of these people, is that your eye just looked to be direct.

1962
01:25:26.16 --> 01:25:27.16
Right?

1963
01:25:27.16 --> 01:25:29.08
That's not good.

1964
01:25:29.08 --> 01:25:35.48
And very seldom, do you end up in situations where you can just be direct with people?

1965
01:25:35.48 --> 01:25:43.96
You have to have real, strong, built relationships with people where you can just be that

1966
01:25:43.96 --> 01:25:46.000
blunt and direct with them.

1967
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.36
Now there are methodologies where you can be direct without being direct.

1968
01:25:51.36 --> 01:25:54.000
You know, you can say things that are, hey, this is what we need to get done right now.

1969
01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.72
You can take an edge off of it.

1970
01:25:57.72 --> 01:26:00.76
You can, and the way you usually do that is by taking your ownership of what it is you're

1971
01:26:00.76 --> 01:26:01.76
trying to make happen.

1972
01:26:01.76 --> 01:26:05.88
So what I don't say is like echo, you need to get this thing edited tonight.

1973
01:26:05.88 --> 01:26:06.88
Yeah.

1974
01:26:06.88 --> 01:26:07.88
Right.

1975
01:26:07.88 --> 01:26:08.88
I don't do that.

1976
01:26:08.88 --> 01:26:12.68
I might say, hey, is there any chance we could get this thing edited tonight?

1977
01:26:12.68 --> 01:26:18.36
Because if we don't, we're going to have a gap in releases which by the way we haven't

1978
01:26:18.36 --> 01:26:19.36
had.

1979
01:26:19.36 --> 01:26:21.96
And that's kind of a thing.

1980
01:26:21.96 --> 01:26:22.96
Yeah.

1981
01:26:22.96 --> 01:26:25.52
You see, even you just kind of know that it's a thing.

1982
01:26:25.52 --> 01:26:26.52
It is, isn't it?

1983
01:26:26.52 --> 01:26:27.52
Right?

1984
01:26:27.52 --> 01:26:29.28
And all of a sudden, you want to edit that thing.

1985
01:26:29.28 --> 01:26:33.76
Not because I told you do, but because you want to keep the gap from opening up.

1986
01:26:33.76 --> 01:26:34.76
Sure.

1987
01:26:34.76 --> 01:26:38.56
So I was, I was directly telling you, but I was indirect.

1988
01:26:38.56 --> 01:26:39.56
Yeah.

1989
01:26:39.56 --> 01:26:40.92
So there's ways to do it.

1990
01:26:40.92 --> 01:26:44.72
But you got to be careful with direct.

1991
01:26:44.72 --> 01:26:45.72
Direct.

1992
01:26:45.72 --> 01:26:52.08
It takes a long time to to hone the scalpel of direct to where it just gets where you

1993
01:26:52.08 --> 01:26:56.16
want to cut and it doesn't leave any collateral damage.

1994
01:26:56.16 --> 01:26:58.52
Not many people would have good at it.

1995
01:26:58.52 --> 01:27:00.52
Every few people are good at it.

1996
01:27:00.52 --> 01:27:01.52
Yeah.

1997
01:27:01.52 --> 01:27:03.52
That's hard.

1998
01:27:03.52 --> 01:27:05.52
Next question.

1999
01:27:05.52 --> 01:27:06.52
Jockel.

2000
01:27:06.52 --> 01:27:10.04
And you know that makes people mad.

2001
01:27:10.04 --> 01:27:11.04
What?

2002
01:27:11.04 --> 01:27:14.72
When you say, listen, you can't just be, you can't just throw to people.

2003
01:27:14.72 --> 01:27:17.16
People want to say, like, there's the book.

2004
01:27:17.16 --> 01:27:24.000
There's a book called Radical Frankness or something like that.

2005
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.44
It's not the name of the book, but it's something like that.

2006
01:27:26.44 --> 01:27:31.96
It's like, hey, we just going to tell the total radical transparency or something like that.

2007
01:27:31.96 --> 01:27:34.60
And it's like, we're just going to tell the truth all the time.

2008
01:27:34.60 --> 01:27:39.08
And we can get there, but man, it is work.

2009
01:27:39.08 --> 01:27:51.20
And it's not even work that has to be that necessarily is the best use of work.

2010
01:27:51.20 --> 01:27:54.32
So yeah, I just know, I just know, I hear people all the time.

2011
01:27:54.32 --> 01:27:56.40
Well, you know, and people, that's what people want me to say.

2012
01:27:56.40 --> 01:27:59.000
I'm going to work with a company that like, you know, what we really need help, what's

2013
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.16
we just need to really learn to be direct with each other.

2014
01:28:01.16 --> 01:28:02.16
Yeah.

2015
01:28:02.16 --> 01:28:07.20
And what they really should be saying is what we need to do is we need to learn to communicate

2016
01:28:07.20 --> 01:28:14.52
with each other, be open about what issues we have, how to solve those problems, and be

2017
01:28:14.52 --> 01:28:18.16
more tactful in our discussions so that people are receptive.

2018
01:28:18.16 --> 01:28:19.16
Yeah.

2019
01:28:19.16 --> 01:28:26.24
Because think about what I just said, if it's not just about me being direct, the more

2020
01:28:26.24 --> 01:28:35.08
important, the only way that I can be direct is if I have set you up in such a way that

2021
01:28:35.08 --> 01:28:41.44
you or I've built you in such a way that you're receptive to my directness.

2022
01:28:41.44 --> 01:28:46.44
Because me being direct without you being receptive, it doesn't work.

2023
01:28:46.44 --> 01:28:48.80
And so often that's what I see.

2024
01:28:48.80 --> 01:28:53.72
I see, hey, I'm direct, but you're not receptive.

2025
01:28:53.72 --> 01:28:55.28
It's, it's game over.

2026
01:28:55.28 --> 01:29:01.52
So even if I'm direct, I'm only 50% of the solution because you have to be receptive.

2027
01:29:01.52 --> 01:29:08.24
What's easier when I, when I go indirect, I become 90% of the solution because I'm going

2028
01:29:08.24 --> 01:29:11.80
to get it into your brain without resistance.

2029
01:29:11.80 --> 01:29:14.88
So I, it's an easier, it's easier upfront as me.

2030
01:29:14.88 --> 01:29:16.44
I'll just be direct.

2031
01:29:16.44 --> 01:29:21.12
That's easy upfront because I just say echo, you're going to get this stuff edited.

2032
01:29:21.12 --> 01:29:22.44
Now, that's direct.

2033
01:29:22.44 --> 01:29:27.08
One of the chances of you being receptive to that, 50%?

2034
01:29:27.08 --> 01:29:31.08
You know, whereas if I, well, let me rephrase that.

2035
01:29:31.08 --> 01:29:35.12
In order for this to be effective, you have to be receptive to it.

2036
01:29:35.12 --> 01:29:38.32
So I only have 50% of the solution.

2037
01:29:38.32 --> 01:29:40.28
You have the other 50%.

2038
01:29:40.28 --> 01:29:45.04
Whereas if I say, like I said before, you know, hey, echo, is there any chance we could get

2039
01:29:45.04 --> 01:29:49.32
this done tonight because here's what's at stake and I go indirect and I make that idea.

2040
01:29:49.32 --> 01:29:52.64
I make your answer, you're going to give me the answer.

2041
01:29:52.64 --> 01:29:56.04
I want, I know it can be edited tonight, right?

2042
01:29:56.04 --> 01:29:57.04
I know that.

2043
01:29:57.04 --> 01:29:59.56
It makes it.

2044
01:29:59.56 --> 01:30:05.64
And so I'm going to, you're actually going to tell me, I'm putting it into, I'm giving

2045
01:30:05.64 --> 01:30:07.32
you to all you have to do is just tell me.

2046
01:30:07.32 --> 01:30:08.80
And now I'm the one that's receptive.

2047
01:30:08.80 --> 01:30:09.80
Yes, we can.

2048
01:30:09.80 --> 01:30:11.000
Oh, that's great.

2049
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000
That's great.

2050
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000
I'm glad.

2051
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.28
So that's something very important to talk about.

2052
01:30:18.28 --> 01:30:22.84
If you want to talk about learning to be direct to with each other, what you really have

2053
01:30:22.84 --> 01:30:25.72
to learn is how to be receptive to directness.

2054
01:30:25.72 --> 01:30:29.60
That's the, that's the long pole in the tent.

2055
01:30:29.60 --> 01:30:31.96
That's what organizations are missing out on.

2056
01:30:31.96 --> 01:30:34.20
Being direct as easy.

2057
01:30:34.20 --> 01:30:37.60
Being direct as the easiest thing in the world.

2058
01:30:37.60 --> 01:30:39.80
You've tell people what you think.

2059
01:30:39.80 --> 01:30:41.000
That's easy.

2060
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.56
What's hard is setting the other person up, developing a relationship so that they're receptive

2061
01:30:45.56 --> 01:30:46.80
to what you're saying.

2062
01:30:46.80 --> 01:30:48.96
Be careful.

2063
01:30:48.96 --> 01:30:51.92
You just play football back in the day.

2064
01:30:51.92 --> 01:30:54.36
And this new quarterback came in.

2065
01:30:54.36 --> 01:30:56.88
What's weird is I forget his name.

2066
01:30:56.88 --> 01:30:58.24
I'm just drawing a blank right now.

2067
01:30:58.24 --> 01:31:01.44
But new young guy tall, any of it gun.

2068
01:31:01.44 --> 01:31:04.08
If you're quarterback and you have a gun, that's impressive.

2069
01:31:04.08 --> 01:31:05.08
Yeah, for sure.

2070
01:31:05.08 --> 01:31:07.68
Means you throw far and fast.

2071
01:31:07.68 --> 01:31:10.48
Here's the thing, though.

2072
01:31:10.48 --> 01:31:14.32
Especially when you're new and you have a gun, you're going to show that gun.

2073
01:31:14.32 --> 01:31:17.68
You're going to be like, when you're playing, when you're warming up before practices and

2074
01:31:17.68 --> 01:31:19.68
stuff like that, you're throwing it hard.

2075
01:31:19.68 --> 01:31:21.68
So this guy was throwing it hard at me.

2076
01:31:21.68 --> 01:31:23.40
I was a receiver.

2077
01:31:23.40 --> 01:31:24.40
It was just standing.

2078
01:31:24.40 --> 01:31:25.56
We were just standing there.

2079
01:31:25.56 --> 01:31:26.76
I wasn't running around.

2080
01:31:26.76 --> 01:31:29.16
So he's throwing it and it's hurting my hand.

2081
01:31:29.16 --> 01:31:33.64
To the point where I couldn't catch some of them because they were coming just too fast.

2082
01:31:33.64 --> 01:31:35.80
For that distance, whatever.

2083
01:31:35.80 --> 01:31:39.28
And, sure, I was impressed with this guy's gun.

2084
01:31:39.28 --> 01:31:43.40
But when we run routes and stuff, he'd still kind of do that.

2085
01:31:43.40 --> 01:31:45.28
I guess maybe to impress the coaches.

2086
01:31:45.28 --> 01:31:48.04
He's a young guy, whatever.

2087
01:31:48.04 --> 01:31:50.08
Here's the thing people would miss his balls.

2088
01:31:50.08 --> 01:31:52.64
They wouldn't catch him because they're coming too hard.

2089
01:31:52.64 --> 01:31:54.44
They're hurting your hands.

2090
01:31:54.44 --> 01:31:55.84
Messing you up.

2091
01:31:55.84 --> 01:31:57.24
So it makes it really hard.

2092
01:31:57.24 --> 01:31:58.24
I get it.

2093
01:31:58.24 --> 01:31:59.44
It's great practice for the receivers.

2094
01:31:59.44 --> 01:32:00.44
Totally is.

2095
01:32:00.44 --> 01:32:05.44
But as far as to effectively land a pass, you know, to complete a pass.

2096
01:32:05.44 --> 01:32:06.44
Right.

2097
01:32:06.44 --> 01:32:07.44
To the work like this.

2098
01:32:07.44 --> 01:32:08.44
And we had this other quarter-long echo.

2099
01:32:08.44 --> 01:32:13.12
Let me just stop you because you may have just made the best analogies that ever made

2100
01:32:13.12 --> 01:32:14.12
on this podcast.

2101
01:32:14.12 --> 01:32:15.12
That is it.

2102
01:32:15.12 --> 01:32:16.12
Cool.

2103
01:32:16.12 --> 01:32:20.12
If you can throw that thing direct, but if you're throwing it too hard and the person's

2104
01:32:20.12 --> 01:32:24.20
not ready to receive it, not even to mention that you might not be ready to read

2105
01:32:24.20 --> 01:32:25.56
you might be looking in the other direction.

2106
01:32:25.56 --> 01:32:27.44
That they'll hit you in the back of the head.

2107
01:32:27.44 --> 01:32:29.44
What good is that direct comment?

2108
01:32:29.44 --> 01:32:30.84
It's zero good.

2109
01:32:30.84 --> 01:32:32.08
It's not good.

2110
01:32:32.08 --> 01:32:33.08
Hurting your hands.

2111
01:32:33.08 --> 01:32:34.32
When you try it, it receives it.

2112
01:32:34.32 --> 01:32:35.32
It hurts you.

2113
01:32:35.32 --> 01:32:36.32
And you don't want to hear anymore.

2114
01:32:36.32 --> 01:32:38.52
You want it anymore to be thrown at you.

2115
01:32:38.52 --> 01:32:39.52
Nope.

2116
01:32:39.52 --> 01:32:40.52
Okay.

2117
01:32:40.52 --> 01:32:41.52
Proceed.

2118
01:32:41.52 --> 01:32:45.64
There's other quarterback who came in from Stanford, but your hard work is paying off.

2119
01:32:45.64 --> 01:32:46.64
That's it.

2120
01:32:46.64 --> 01:32:47.64
Thanks.

2121
01:32:47.64 --> 01:32:49.44
I knew it would.

2122
01:32:49.44 --> 01:32:50.44
So, is that the quarterback came in?

2123
01:32:50.44 --> 01:32:52.08
That quarterback make it anywhere.

2124
01:32:52.08 --> 01:32:53.08
Did he make it?

2125
01:32:53.08 --> 01:32:55.68
He did not make it to the NFL.

2126
01:32:55.68 --> 01:32:56.92
So, it's like quarterback came in.

2127
01:32:56.92 --> 01:32:57.92
His name is Tim Kerry.

2128
01:32:57.92 --> 01:32:59.88
He came from Stanford.

2129
01:32:59.88 --> 01:33:00.88
And he came in.

2130
01:33:00.88 --> 01:33:01.88
He was the opposite.

2131
01:33:01.88 --> 01:33:02.88
Actually not the opposite.

2132
01:33:02.88 --> 01:33:03.88
Because he had a guy.

2133
01:33:03.88 --> 01:33:04.88
He could throw far enough.

2134
01:33:04.88 --> 01:33:09.16
But the way he threw it was like, it was like the perfect pass.

2135
01:33:09.16 --> 01:33:11.92
And every distance had a different velocity on it.

2136
01:33:11.92 --> 01:33:18.04
It was like that kind where the next, if it would modulate it, it was so well.

2137
01:33:18.04 --> 01:33:19.80
He modulated so well where it was.

2138
01:33:19.80 --> 01:33:20.80
Where it was.

2139
01:33:20.80 --> 01:33:21.80
For those chances.

2140
01:33:21.80 --> 01:33:22.80
Correctness.

2141
01:33:22.80 --> 01:33:23.80
Oh, yeah.

2142
01:33:23.80 --> 01:33:24.80
Everything.

2143
01:33:24.80 --> 01:33:28.80
And for them to get better, he would have to physically walk it and put it in your hand.

2144
01:33:28.80 --> 01:33:29.80
It was like that.

2145
01:33:29.80 --> 01:33:30.80
Good.

2146
01:33:30.80 --> 01:33:32.60
When it come, you know.

2147
01:33:32.60 --> 01:33:35.52
And when you have them side by side, oh man.

2148
01:33:35.52 --> 01:33:37.48
I want that direct guy.

2149
01:33:37.48 --> 01:33:39.08
Want a finesse guy.

2150
01:33:39.08 --> 01:33:40.08
No.

2151
01:33:40.08 --> 01:33:41.08
But he did have the capability.

2152
01:33:41.08 --> 01:33:42.08
He did have the capability.

2153
01:33:42.08 --> 01:33:43.08
Did he get to the NFL?

2154
01:33:43.08 --> 01:33:45.08
I, maybe.

2155
01:33:45.08 --> 01:33:46.08
I forget.

2156
01:33:46.08 --> 01:33:48.08
He left Stanford to come to your college.

2157
01:33:48.08 --> 01:33:49.88
Oh, I forget why.

2158
01:33:49.88 --> 01:33:52.32
But I think it was a whole thing.

2159
01:33:52.32 --> 01:33:54.08
There was a few Stanford guys that came.

2160
01:33:54.08 --> 01:33:55.08
Yeah.

2161
01:33:55.08 --> 01:33:56.08
That's interesting.

2162
01:33:56.08 --> 01:33:59.08
A few guys from Stanford that came to your school.

2163
01:33:59.08 --> 01:34:00.08
They didn't.

2164
01:34:00.08 --> 01:34:01.08
Yeah.

2165
01:34:01.08 --> 01:34:02.08
It was doing it.

2166
01:34:02.08 --> 01:34:04.08
I want to say when we changed coaching staffs.

2167
01:34:04.08 --> 01:34:07.28
Oh, they might have been some scouts connections.

2168
01:34:07.28 --> 01:34:09.88
Maybe like some relationships that were already there.

2169
01:34:09.88 --> 01:34:12.04
Even some of the coaches I think came from that area.

2170
01:34:12.04 --> 01:34:13.04
I don't know.

2171
01:34:13.04 --> 01:34:14.56
I forget that was a long time ago.

2172
01:34:14.56 --> 01:34:16.52
But nonetheless, yeah.

2173
01:34:16.52 --> 01:34:18.04
That's what it shook out.

2174
01:34:18.04 --> 01:34:19.04
Check out.

2175
01:34:19.04 --> 01:34:21.28
So there you go.

2176
01:34:21.28 --> 01:34:22.28
Jocco.

2177
01:34:22.28 --> 01:34:26.12
13 year street cop here.

2178
01:34:26.12 --> 01:34:27.76
My old man died when I was 10.

2179
01:34:27.76 --> 01:34:30.24
It cut deep and I grew up with no one.

2180
01:34:30.24 --> 01:34:34.32
Having two boys on my own now and loving to get after it on the street.

2181
01:34:34.32 --> 01:34:37.52
I worry about the risk.

2182
01:34:37.52 --> 01:34:45.12
How do I balance being the spear with ensuring I stay around for that?

2183
01:34:45.12 --> 01:34:50.68
So first of all, we have to recognize that there's no way that you can ensure that you

2184
01:34:50.68 --> 01:34:53.32
stay around.

2185
01:34:53.32 --> 01:34:55.68
And in fact, one day you will not be around.

2186
01:34:55.68 --> 01:34:57.76
One day none of us will be around.

2187
01:34:57.76 --> 01:34:59.04
That's the fact.

2188
01:34:59.04 --> 01:35:04.96
And that actually doesn't matter what your job is.

2189
01:35:04.96 --> 01:35:06.72
And there's all kinds of things.

2190
01:35:06.72 --> 01:35:09.24
Regardless of your job, whether you have a car accident, whether you have a heart attack,

2191
01:35:09.24 --> 01:35:14.08
whether you have cancer or a plane crash or a random violence or some random accident,

2192
01:35:14.08 --> 01:35:16.36
there's all different kind of ways to die.

2193
01:35:16.36 --> 01:35:23.28
Now, you are correct that the death rate of cops is higher.

2194
01:35:23.28 --> 01:35:26.16
It's higher than a normal civilian.

2195
01:35:26.16 --> 01:35:33.16
But what, like, loggers, construction workers, they all have higher rates of death than a cop,

2196
01:35:33.16 --> 01:35:38.40
roofers, roofers.

2197
01:35:38.40 --> 01:35:41.96
If you're a roofer, you have a higher rate of death than a cop.

2198
01:35:41.96 --> 01:35:46.64
Any drivers, anyone that drives for a living, whether they're a trucker or whether they're

2199
01:35:46.64 --> 01:35:54.08
literally a traveling salesman, they have a higher rate of death than being police.

2200
01:35:54.08 --> 01:36:00.72
So no matter what you do, there's a chance that you could die.

2201
01:36:00.72 --> 01:36:06.28
And I'll tell you what, I think about this sometime in the reverse of what scares you about

2202
01:36:06.28 --> 01:36:07.36
what your kids do.

2203
01:36:07.36 --> 01:36:12.60
If your kids are engaging in activity that could be dangerous, whether it's parachuting,

2204
01:36:12.60 --> 01:36:14.84
whether it's rock climbing, whatever.

2205
01:36:14.84 --> 01:36:19.52
Like there's things that your kids could do that they could die.

2206
01:36:19.52 --> 01:36:26.20
What you could do is not allow them to do it, wrap them in bubble, bubble wrap and not

2207
01:36:26.20 --> 01:36:28.04
allow them to go anywhere.

2208
01:36:28.04 --> 01:36:32.28
And guess what, even if you do that, there's still a chance.

2209
01:36:32.28 --> 01:36:36.72
And you've taken away their growth.

2210
01:36:36.72 --> 01:36:41.96
So you can look at it in the reverse as well, that there's some things that you're not

2211
01:36:41.96 --> 01:36:44.20
going to be able to control.

2212
01:36:44.20 --> 01:36:48.84
And no matter what, you're a kid, you could say, I don't want my kid to join the military

2213
01:36:48.84 --> 01:36:51.08
and so they go to college and what happens in college.

2214
01:36:51.08 --> 01:36:53.08
They get hit by a job driver.

2215
01:36:53.08 --> 01:36:58.52
They, like there's enough bad things that can happen in either one of those situations.

2216
01:36:58.52 --> 01:37:00.80
And same thing with you and your job.

2217
01:37:00.80 --> 01:37:05.68
You could go get a job doing something, unless you get a job that's just straight up,

2218
01:37:05.68 --> 01:37:13.32
in an administrative situation with no, with very limited commute and very limited driving,

2219
01:37:13.32 --> 01:37:16.64
then that might increase your chance a little bit.

2220
01:37:16.64 --> 01:37:22.48
But then you know, then are you doing something that you actually like to do?

2221
01:37:22.48 --> 01:37:24.12
So there's your dilemma.

2222
01:37:24.12 --> 01:37:26.20
So what do you do in a situation like this?

2223
01:37:26.20 --> 01:37:31.80
What you do is you train and you prepare and you vigilant and you take care of your

2224
01:37:31.80 --> 01:37:32.80
sons.

2225
01:37:32.80 --> 01:37:37.48
Obviously, and you explain your job to them and you explain to them why you train hard

2226
01:37:37.48 --> 01:37:45.52
and explain to them, why you're willing to make a sacrifice to keep others safe, including

2227
01:37:45.52 --> 01:37:46.52
them.

2228
01:37:46.52 --> 01:37:50.68
You work every day to keep them safe as well.

2229
01:37:50.68 --> 01:38:01.76
And if you explain that to your sons, they will grow up with an understanding of service

2230
01:38:01.76 --> 01:38:09.92
and discipline and duty and courage and honor.

2231
01:38:09.92 --> 01:38:20.24
And by the way, if something did happen to you, the model that you set for them would have

2232
01:38:20.24 --> 01:38:29.60
massive impact would have massive impact on them and how they would live their lives.

2233
01:38:29.60 --> 01:38:32.08
And I believe it would be actually a positive impact.

2234
01:38:32.08 --> 01:38:35.04
Sure, would they miss you absolutely?

2235
01:38:35.04 --> 01:38:38.32
Sure, would they wish more than anything that you could be back?

2236
01:38:38.32 --> 01:38:43.12
Yes, but would they recognize that their dad made this sacrifice?

2237
01:38:43.12 --> 01:38:45.44
Yes, they would.

2238
01:38:45.44 --> 01:38:47.16
Would they live to honor that sacrifice?

2239
01:38:47.16 --> 01:38:49.72
Yes, they would.

2240
01:38:49.72 --> 01:38:58.40
So that's one thing you can do if you want to keep that profession.

2241
01:38:58.40 --> 01:39:03.92
Now if that, if you can't get around that, if that doesn't make sense, which it's understandable,

2242
01:39:03.92 --> 01:39:05.80
if you look at me and say, hey, doggle, I get it.

2243
01:39:05.80 --> 01:39:09.40
I want my kids to be raised with honor, but I'd want to be there, and that's more important

2244
01:39:09.40 --> 01:39:10.40
to me.

2245
01:39:10.40 --> 01:39:17.44
And if that's where you end up, then what you have to do is plot out what another job, what

2246
01:39:17.44 --> 01:39:19.16
another career is going to be.

2247
01:39:19.16 --> 01:39:25.88
And like I said, then you have to make it doing something that legitimately gets you into

2248
01:39:25.88 --> 01:39:34.80
a better survival rate, which by the way, outlaws just about every outdoor job you could

2249
01:39:34.80 --> 01:39:35.64
have.

2250
01:39:35.64 --> 01:39:40.000
If you work in construction, nope, that's not it.

2251
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.60
Working as the lecturers, nope, that's not it.

2252
01:39:41.60 --> 01:39:44.12
Working as alignment, nope, that's not it.

2253
01:39:44.12 --> 01:39:50.16
All those jobs, all those outdoor jobs go look at this statistics, go Google, death rates

2254
01:39:50.16 --> 01:39:51.60
in jobs.

2255
01:39:51.60 --> 01:39:53.40
And there's all kinds of fishermen.

2256
01:39:53.40 --> 01:39:56.40
No, forget about it.

2257
01:39:56.40 --> 01:40:00.88
There's so many jobs that have a high death rate where accidents happen.

2258
01:40:00.88 --> 01:40:05.88
So what you're talking about going into the life you're going into would be going into

2259
01:40:05.88 --> 01:40:10.48
would be an administrative job of some kind.

2260
01:40:10.48 --> 01:40:14.80
And if you think you can do that, and you think that'll be, give you the satisfaction that

2261
01:40:14.80 --> 01:40:17.44
you want, then it's a possibility.

2262
01:40:17.44 --> 01:40:18.88
Think about it.

2263
01:40:18.88 --> 01:40:23.28
But if you look at it and you think you know what, that's not for me.

2264
01:40:23.28 --> 01:40:28.64
Then, train hard to prepare, build a great relationship with your sons.

2265
01:40:28.64 --> 01:40:33.20
They vigilant, don't get complacent ever.

2266
01:40:33.20 --> 01:40:34.20
And be aggressive.

2267
01:40:34.20 --> 01:40:46.52
But have to throw that one in there because in my opinion, when an individual gets scared

2268
01:40:46.52 --> 01:40:51.24
or gets hesitant or gets overprotective of themselves, I believe they're in more danger,

2269
01:40:51.24 --> 01:40:53.52
not less danger in more danger.

2270
01:40:53.52 --> 01:41:01.68
So if you think that having kids, having your sons is making you less aggressive and more

2271
01:41:01.68 --> 01:41:07.52
scared, I think you're at higher risk.

2272
01:41:07.52 --> 01:41:10.64
So if you're going to do the job, you do the job.

2273
01:41:10.64 --> 01:41:13.48
You get aggressive when you do the job.

2274
01:41:13.48 --> 01:41:20.72
And if you can't, then you might want to look and see if there's other alternatives that

2275
01:41:20.72 --> 01:41:21.72
are out there.

2276
01:41:21.72 --> 01:41:27.12
And I would say, is this how often, like your street copy, you've been there for 13 years,

2277
01:41:27.12 --> 01:41:29.76
is there another department you could go to?

2278
01:41:29.76 --> 01:41:33.96
Is there some other way to serve and stay connected?

2279
01:41:33.96 --> 01:41:37.80
Use your experience in another way.

2280
01:41:37.80 --> 01:41:44.24
Maybe one area that has a little less probability of getting killed.

2281
01:41:44.24 --> 01:41:47.12
Again, you got to look if that's something you really want to do.

2282
01:41:47.12 --> 01:41:52.56
So ultimately, and I tell this to people, a lot is there's only one person that can make

2283
01:41:52.56 --> 01:41:54.20
this decision, and it's not me.

2284
01:41:54.20 --> 01:41:56.36
The only person that can make this decision is you.

2285
01:41:56.36 --> 01:41:58.88
So think through it, be thoughtful.

2286
01:41:58.88 --> 01:42:04.16
You can even talk about it with your boys, depending on how old they are.

2287
01:42:04.16 --> 01:42:08.28
But you can talk about it with them, explain to them.

2288
01:42:08.28 --> 01:42:12.44
And you know, see what they say?

2289
01:42:12.44 --> 01:42:18.12
So obviously, there's one way that conversation go, hey, would you guys be sit?

2290
01:42:18.12 --> 01:42:19.92
Would you guys want me to die?

2291
01:42:19.92 --> 01:42:20.92
Right?

2292
01:42:20.92 --> 01:42:21.92
Of course.

2293
01:42:21.92 --> 01:42:22.92
What are they going to say?

2294
01:42:22.92 --> 01:42:23.92
Oh my gosh, quit that job immediately.

2295
01:42:23.92 --> 01:42:26.36
We don't want you to do that.

2296
01:42:26.36 --> 01:42:30.08
So you're going to have to think about what the ages of your kids are.

2297
01:42:30.08 --> 01:42:33.32
But you're going to have to think through that one whether or how you address it with them.

2298
01:42:33.32 --> 01:42:41.40
But certainly, I always look at it that there's risk at everything you do.

2299
01:42:41.40 --> 01:42:45.24
The money will take risk doing something that you love doing, and that you know is helping

2300
01:42:45.24 --> 01:42:46.24
other people.

2301
01:42:46.24 --> 01:42:50.92
And you know a setting a good example for your boys.

2302
01:42:50.92 --> 01:42:56.000
And if that doesn't make sense, cool, find a different job.

2303
01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Next question.

2304
01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:03.48
I was young by living in a foster home and was sexually assaulted by my foster father,

2305
01:43:03.48 --> 01:43:07.16
and sometimes other people over a course of a couple of years.

2306
01:43:07.16 --> 01:43:08.80
I was eventually adopted.

2307
01:43:08.80 --> 01:43:12.000
And what had happened to me was never discussed and I never got out for it.

2308
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.56
I was afraid of everything.

2309
01:43:13.56 --> 01:43:17.36
And eventually, I played sports and ice-cream, felt less afraid.

2310
01:43:17.36 --> 01:43:20.80
Went into the army and felt completely unaffraid of anything.

2311
01:43:20.80 --> 01:43:24.08
When I got out, I got on to a long-term relationship.

2312
01:43:24.08 --> 01:43:27.28
I told my then girlfriend, what had happened to me?

2313
01:43:27.28 --> 01:43:29.32
She was the first person I ever told about this.

2314
01:43:29.32 --> 01:43:31.92
She convinced me to reach out to my foster parents.

2315
01:43:31.92 --> 01:43:32.92
And I did.

2316
01:43:32.92 --> 01:43:34.92
And it was a total disaster.

2317
01:43:34.92 --> 01:43:41.96
They kept my room where all this bad stuff had happened exactly the same as it was 20 years prior

2318
01:43:41.96 --> 01:43:44.48
when these horrors had occurred.

2319
01:43:44.48 --> 01:43:49.20
I had my moment to confront this monster that had done this to me.

2320
01:43:49.20 --> 01:43:50.44
And I failed.

2321
01:43:50.44 --> 01:43:55.68
I used a word that he always said to me, which was, I used a word that he always said

2322
01:43:55.68 --> 01:43:57.72
to me when he was assaulting me.

2323
01:43:57.72 --> 01:44:01.32
He just said, sometimes people change.

2324
01:44:01.32 --> 01:44:05.32
All of a sudden, I was a weak young boy again.

2325
01:44:05.32 --> 01:44:06.92
And I couldn't fight back.

2326
01:44:06.92 --> 01:44:09.44
I left the house and had serious self-doubt.

2327
01:44:09.44 --> 01:44:11.000
Eventually I became a cop.

2328
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:17.08
And then a detective in a faced all types of bad people from junkies to murders.

2329
01:44:17.08 --> 01:44:20.92
I even get full confessions out of child rapists.

2330
01:44:20.92 --> 01:44:23.12
I'm sick of my stomach afterwards.

2331
01:44:23.12 --> 01:44:27.56
It's terrible to hear what these animals do.

2332
01:44:27.56 --> 01:44:28.96
My question is this.

2333
01:44:28.96 --> 01:44:31.56
Recently the past has come back with a vengeance.

2334
01:44:31.56 --> 01:44:35.92
I can't get through a short time, maybe an hour or two without thinking about the past

2335
01:44:35.92 --> 01:44:37.44
and my failure.

2336
01:44:37.44 --> 01:44:42.20
The only time I have peace is when I absolutely destroyed myself working out.

2337
01:44:42.20 --> 01:44:45.52
I consider it punishing myself and feel better when I do it.

2338
01:44:45.52 --> 01:44:52.40
How can I stop this or at least manage it better?

2339
01:44:52.40 --> 01:45:02.36
So this is, I mean, obviously horrible situation and horrible that you had to live through

2340
01:45:02.36 --> 01:45:11.04
this and that any kid or any one, any human would have to go through this, as far as

2341
01:45:11.04 --> 01:45:14.96
how you can manage this better.

2342
01:45:14.96 --> 01:45:18.64
I'm going to go a little bit here.

2343
01:45:18.64 --> 01:45:27.46
So one of the blocks of training that we go through in a seal platoon is called close

2344
01:45:27.46 --> 01:45:29.36
quarters combat.

2345
01:45:29.36 --> 01:45:33.32
And this is the training you're in a thing called the kill house.

2346
01:45:33.32 --> 01:45:34.80
It's ballistic walls.

2347
01:45:34.80 --> 01:45:36.40
There's targets in there.

2348
01:45:36.40 --> 01:45:37.96
You're moving around dynamically.

2349
01:45:37.96 --> 01:45:39.52
You're shooting live fire ammunition.

2350
01:45:39.52 --> 01:45:41.12
There's people.

2351
01:45:41.12 --> 01:45:42.72
Six inches away from you.

2352
01:45:42.72 --> 01:45:45.48
You're taking really close shots.

2353
01:45:45.48 --> 01:45:48.52
There's a lot of pressure in there.

2354
01:45:48.52 --> 01:45:52.32
There's a lot of details, a lot of standard operating procedures and safety procedures that

2355
01:45:52.32 --> 01:45:53.32
you have to follow.

2356
01:45:53.32 --> 01:45:54.96
There's a lot of process.

2357
01:45:54.96 --> 01:45:57.48
It's like, do you need to go left or right?

2358
01:45:57.48 --> 01:45:58.68
Is that a good guy or a bad guy?

2359
01:45:58.68 --> 01:46:00.76
Because you have to identify the targets.

2360
01:46:00.76 --> 01:46:03.04
Should you move or should you stay?

2361
01:46:03.04 --> 01:46:05.24
How do you communicate that you need to move?

2362
01:46:05.24 --> 01:46:08.52
Should you shoot or should you not shoot at a target?

2363
01:46:08.52 --> 01:46:12.68
And so there's all these things going on when you enter a room.

2364
01:46:12.68 --> 01:46:16.92
All these things that you have to go through.

2365
01:46:16.92 --> 01:46:20.08
All these steps that you have to take, all these procedures that you have to follow.

2366
01:46:20.08 --> 01:46:21.76
All these decisions that you have to make.

2367
01:46:21.76 --> 01:46:24.28
And it all happens in a split second.

2368
01:46:24.28 --> 01:46:32.04
And so in a kill house, the training cadre is actually above you.

2369
01:46:32.04 --> 01:46:34.24
It's not a normal house.

2370
01:46:34.24 --> 01:46:37.92
The rooms have what we call catwalks above them.

2371
01:46:37.92 --> 01:46:42.000
So the cadre can be up above you in the catwalks and they're walking around and

2372
01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.40
they're watching you very closely.

2373
01:46:44.40 --> 01:46:47.28
It's like watching a football game on TV.

2374
01:46:47.28 --> 01:46:50.72
You're seeing it from the perfect view above the person.

2375
01:46:50.72 --> 01:46:53.52
And they're in the room with you, but they're not in your way at all because they're

2376
01:46:53.52 --> 01:46:55.12
up on the catwalk.

2377
01:46:55.12 --> 01:47:02.000
So what happens is when a room entry happens, there's a lot of, you catch a lot of critique

2378
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.40
from the people in the catwalk.

2379
01:47:06.40 --> 01:47:11.32
And they'll say, you could, you could have done this or you could have done that or you

2380
01:47:11.32 --> 01:47:13.32
could have moved left or you should have pushed forward.

2381
01:47:13.32 --> 01:47:16.20
There's, you know, you, it would be better if you'd done this other thing.

2382
01:47:16.20 --> 01:47:18.56
So there's all these different things.

2383
01:47:18.56 --> 01:47:21.80
And when my cadre was running it, you know, that's what we do.

2384
01:47:21.80 --> 01:47:23.68
That's what happened to me when I was cadre.

2385
01:47:23.68 --> 01:47:24.60
That's what I would do.

2386
01:47:24.60 --> 01:47:27.000
That's what everyone does.

2387
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.16
And at some point, I kind of realized that all that stuff is good.

2388
01:47:31.16 --> 01:47:32.000
And I get it.

2389
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.88
Like you've got to get people to run the procedures correctly.

2390
01:47:35.88 --> 01:47:42.60
But in a certain point, what I would tell, like after a guy was kind of beat down,

2391
01:47:42.60 --> 01:47:45.44
like you just couldn't get something right or you would, you know, punch people,

2392
01:47:45.44 --> 01:47:51.84
jump on him about a decision that he made or a movement that he made or whatever.

2393
01:47:51.84 --> 01:47:53.36
And I'm not talking about safety things.

2394
01:47:53.36 --> 01:47:54.68
Because the safety thing is different.

2395
01:47:54.68 --> 01:47:56.48
I'm talking about a tactical decision.

2396
01:47:56.48 --> 01:47:59.80
And when you walk into a room, there's a bunch of tactical decisions you can make.

2397
01:47:59.80 --> 01:48:04.68
And if there's, 10, if there's five different decisions that you could make when you walk into

2398
01:48:04.68 --> 01:48:09.20
a room, there's something that there's, you know, there's one way of doing it that would

2399
01:48:09.20 --> 01:48:12.64
be like really clean, one would be a little bit less.

2400
01:48:12.64 --> 01:48:15.68
One might be just as clean as the first one, but it's a different attitude.

2401
01:48:15.68 --> 01:48:20.36
There's just all these different decisions that you could make.

2402
01:48:20.36 --> 01:48:26.24
You know, it's like just a multitude of ways that you could react.

2403
01:48:26.24 --> 01:48:27.52
Because that's what this question is.

2404
01:48:27.52 --> 01:48:30.36
How you reacted in this situation.

2405
01:48:30.36 --> 01:48:37.88
And eventually, as I would see this with an individual, I would eventually, I, what

2406
01:48:37.88 --> 01:48:47.12
I would tell guys is, listen, you did what you did.

2407
01:48:47.12 --> 01:48:49.000
You did what you did.

2408
01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.36
That's what you did.

2409
01:48:51.36 --> 01:48:54.20
That's the decision that you made at the time.

2410
01:48:54.20 --> 01:48:56.000
And you know what?

2411
01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.68
There's different ways you could have done it.

2412
01:48:57.68 --> 01:48:58.84
You don't like the way you did it.

2413
01:48:58.84 --> 01:49:01.64
I don't like the way you did it.

2414
01:49:01.64 --> 01:49:04.08
Someone, one of the other cadre members doesn't like the way you did it.

2415
01:49:04.08 --> 01:49:06.40
It doesn't, what I'm saying, it doesn't really matter.

2416
01:49:06.40 --> 01:49:08.88
First of all, you can't take it back.

2417
01:49:08.88 --> 01:49:11.16
You can't go back and undo it.

2418
01:49:11.16 --> 01:49:15.60
And by the way, you don't get to rehearse these things to a point where you get to do this

2419
01:49:15.60 --> 01:49:16.60
perfectly.

2420
01:49:16.60 --> 01:49:18.40
Because you won't be able to do that.

2421
01:49:18.40 --> 01:49:23.04
If you rehearsed a move in a room that you had seen before and you rehearsed it 10 times,

2422
01:49:23.04 --> 01:49:25.44
that's not, that's a totally different game.

2423
01:49:25.44 --> 01:49:26.44
Right?

2424
01:49:26.44 --> 01:49:30.28
If I already know what the room consists of, and I'm going to rehearse and choreograph

2425
01:49:30.28 --> 01:49:32.56
the entire movement, that's a different game.

2426
01:49:32.56 --> 01:49:33.56
That's not decision making.

2427
01:49:33.56 --> 01:49:35.64
That's just, that's just rope memorization.

2428
01:49:35.64 --> 01:49:37.64
We're not talking about that.

2429
01:49:37.64 --> 01:49:42.72
We're talking about how did you react and what you did is what you did and you did it

2430
01:49:42.72 --> 01:49:43.88
for a reason.

2431
01:49:43.88 --> 01:49:48.48
What you saw in front of you, you made this decision for a reason.

2432
01:49:48.48 --> 01:49:53.12
Maybe you saw a threat when there wasn't one there or you lost situational awareness

2433
01:49:53.12 --> 01:49:58.56
or you rushed, you went too fast, you tried to rush and all those things can kind of

2434
01:49:58.56 --> 01:50:00.20
trip you up.

2435
01:50:00.20 --> 01:50:03.68
But that's what you did and you did what you did and you can't take it back.

2436
01:50:03.68 --> 01:50:06.72
Instead of everyone sitting there saying you should have done this and you should have done

2437
01:50:06.72 --> 01:50:10.64
that, let's do this.

2438
01:50:10.64 --> 01:50:13.36
Let's see what we can learn from it.

2439
01:50:13.36 --> 01:50:17.28
Let's see why you did what you did.

2440
01:50:17.28 --> 01:50:20.80
Let's see why you made that decision.

2441
01:50:20.80 --> 01:50:26.64
Because once we know why you did something, now we have something that we can work with,

2442
01:50:26.64 --> 01:50:33.44
we have something that we can improve upon.

2443
01:50:33.44 --> 01:50:39.20
That is what I think you need to do in this situation.

2444
01:50:39.20 --> 01:50:45.20
And really when anyone makes a mistake or has a reaction that they don't like, you can't

2445
01:50:45.20 --> 01:50:49.76
worry, you can't continue to worry about something that is already transpired, what you

2446
01:50:49.76 --> 01:50:55.96
have to do is you have to look at and say what can I learn from it?

2447
01:50:55.96 --> 01:51:03.20
What can I take from this and how can I take this mistake and make me better?

2448
01:51:03.20 --> 01:51:04.68
So you could look at this.

2449
01:51:04.68 --> 01:51:07.52
Why did you do that?

2450
01:51:07.52 --> 01:51:11.72
Maybe you did it because you didn't want to open up these old wounds.

2451
01:51:11.72 --> 01:51:16.32
Maybe you did it because you would have confronting this individual would have caused

2452
01:51:16.32 --> 01:51:21.84
more drama and that drama, you at that moment, you assessed and said, you know what?

2453
01:51:21.84 --> 01:51:24.36
This drama isn't worth it.

2454
01:51:24.36 --> 01:51:30.60
Maybe you protected yourself from more drama and that was your instinct.

2455
01:51:30.60 --> 01:51:34.96
Maybe if you were to start confronting this guy and go and crazy, who knows what could

2456
01:51:34.96 --> 01:51:37.48
happen and maybe it could have taken a turn for us?

2457
01:51:37.48 --> 01:51:39.68
We don't know what the outcome was.

2458
01:51:39.68 --> 01:51:43.56
We know that you weren't happy with your decision, understandable, but we don't even know

2459
01:51:43.56 --> 01:51:45.48
what the other decisions were to lead to.

2460
01:51:45.48 --> 01:51:50.08
So you're actually getting bogged down and distraught about something that you don't even

2461
01:51:50.08 --> 01:51:52.84
know if it was a good decision or a bad decision.

2462
01:51:52.84 --> 01:51:55.44
It feels like it was a bad decision, but you don't know what the outcome is of the other

2463
01:51:55.44 --> 01:51:59.12
decisions even were.

2464
01:51:59.12 --> 01:52:03.80
So you can't change the outcome of what happened in the past.

2465
01:52:03.80 --> 01:52:07.20
You can't do it.

2466
01:52:07.20 --> 01:52:09.60
But what you can do is you can grow from it.

2467
01:52:09.60 --> 01:52:12.24
That's what you can do.

2468
01:52:12.24 --> 01:52:13.72
You can learn from it.

2469
01:52:13.72 --> 01:52:19.20
You can actually take that scenario and you can mentally replay it in your head and you can

2470
01:52:19.20 --> 01:52:25.84
figure out if possibly their would have been or could have been a better outcome.

2471
01:52:25.84 --> 01:52:29.08
Or maybe that that outcome that you had wasn't that bad.

2472
01:52:29.08 --> 01:52:30.72
Maybe it leads somewhere else.

2473
01:52:30.72 --> 01:52:34.44
We don't know yet.

2474
01:52:34.44 --> 01:52:39.08
But that's where you are at right now.

2475
01:52:39.08 --> 01:52:46.48
You can't change the outcome of something that has occurred in the past.

2476
01:52:46.48 --> 01:52:50.72
Now I'm going to throw a little dichotomy at you right now.

2477
01:52:50.72 --> 01:52:56.84
And I'm going to say something that's a little bit might be a little bit hard to understand

2478
01:52:56.84 --> 01:53:00.28
I'm going to try and talk my way through it.

2479
01:53:00.28 --> 01:53:09.24
Because while you can't change the past, what you can change is you can absolutely change

2480
01:53:09.24 --> 01:53:16.64
the way that the past is perceived.

2481
01:53:16.64 --> 01:53:19.40
So let me give you a detached example.

2482
01:53:19.40 --> 01:53:20.40
Just another example.

2483
01:53:20.40 --> 01:53:25.08
If you had an individual, someone gets fired from a job.

2484
01:53:25.08 --> 01:53:32.08
They get fired from their job and when they get fired from the job, it what it does is

2485
01:53:32.08 --> 01:53:36.28
their confidence goes down and they get depressed and they decide they're not going to

2486
01:53:36.28 --> 01:53:39.96
apply for a new job because I don't even know if I deserve it to get a new job and they

2487
01:53:39.96 --> 01:53:46.24
sit around and eventually they go on apply for kind of like a lesser job.

2488
01:53:46.24 --> 01:53:50.64
And you know who knows, maybe they start drinking to relieve some of their depression and

2489
01:53:50.64 --> 01:53:54.84
now they're late and now they end up on a downward spiral.

2490
01:53:54.84 --> 01:54:01.80
He would look at them being fired as something that destroyed them in ruining their life.

2491
01:54:01.80 --> 01:54:03.08
That's how we would perceive it.

2492
01:54:03.08 --> 01:54:06.36
Hey, the individual got, they were, they were doing fine.

2493
01:54:06.36 --> 01:54:09.80
Then they got fired and now they lost their confidence and got depressed.

2494
01:54:09.80 --> 01:54:10.80
They started drinking.

2495
01:54:10.80 --> 01:54:12.28
They didn't apply for good jobs.

2496
01:54:12.28 --> 01:54:16.16
And now their life is totally different and it's a bad place.

2497
01:54:16.16 --> 01:54:23.08
We would perceive that them getting fired did that to them.

2498
01:54:23.08 --> 01:54:28.56
But if that person, if a person got fired from their job and in, in steady, was like

2499
01:54:28.56 --> 01:54:31.92
a wake up call for them.

2500
01:54:31.92 --> 01:54:36.40
And they immediately applied for a bunch of other jobs and maybe they didn't get those

2501
01:54:36.40 --> 01:54:40.76
because they had just been fired but maybe they took a lesser job, a lower paying job but

2502
01:54:40.76 --> 01:54:44.44
they got in there and they had realized they had made a mistake and they started getting

2503
01:54:44.44 --> 01:54:48.44
after that like they never gotten after it before.

2504
01:54:48.44 --> 01:54:52.80
They started working as hard as they possibly could and got promoted and they got

2505
01:54:52.80 --> 01:54:58.68
promoted again and just dominated in those positions and went even harder and dominated

2506
01:54:58.68 --> 01:55:03.92
even more and eventually took over their whole company.

2507
01:55:03.92 --> 01:55:04.92
And this isn't crazy.

2508
01:55:04.92 --> 01:55:06.12
This isn't too far fetched.

2509
01:55:06.12 --> 01:55:07.80
This can happen.

2510
01:55:07.80 --> 01:55:15.60
But if that happened, that same incident, the firing of this individual would be perceived

2511
01:55:15.60 --> 01:55:16.60
in a totally different way.

2512
01:55:16.60 --> 01:55:26.16
It would be perceived as a catalyst that changed their life for the better.

2513
01:55:26.16 --> 01:55:34.80
And there are all kinds of examples like that in the world.

2514
01:55:34.80 --> 01:55:39.72
The past can't be changed.

2515
01:55:39.72 --> 01:55:47.16
What the past can change you for the better or it can change you for the worse and my

2516
01:55:47.16 --> 01:55:54.60
question is why not make it for the better?

2517
01:55:54.60 --> 01:55:57.84
Why not make the past change you for the better?

2518
01:55:57.84 --> 01:56:05.32
You hear the term narrative thrown around these days, especially like in political circles

2519
01:56:05.32 --> 01:56:13.24
you'll hear it on the news that narratives they're created in the political arena.

2520
01:56:13.24 --> 01:56:21.92
And what the narrative does is it supports an overarching aim or an overarching value or an

2521
01:56:21.92 --> 01:56:24.36
overarching goal.

2522
01:56:24.36 --> 01:56:28.08
That's the way people use the term narrative right now.

2523
01:56:28.08 --> 01:56:33.08
But I'm not talking about that type of political narrative.

2524
01:56:33.08 --> 01:56:44.48
What I'm saying here is that you actually write the narrative of what happened in your past.

2525
01:56:44.48 --> 01:56:46.52
I'm not talking about a fabrication of it.

2526
01:56:46.52 --> 01:56:50.04
I'm talking you get the right, the narrative of where it takes you.

2527
01:56:50.04 --> 01:56:57.32
You get to write the narrative, you get to write the reality of where you end up.

2528
01:56:57.32 --> 01:57:01.04
You get to write it.

2529
01:57:01.04 --> 01:57:06.16
You get to control it.

2530
01:57:06.16 --> 01:57:11.28
So what I'm saying is control it.

2531
01:57:11.28 --> 01:57:15.52
Get control of that narrative.

2532
01:57:15.52 --> 01:57:18.92
Take control of that narrative.

2533
01:57:18.92 --> 01:57:24.88
That horrible story in your past ends the way that you want it to end.

2534
01:57:24.88 --> 01:57:27.04
You control the narrative.

2535
01:57:27.04 --> 01:57:28.52
You control that story.

2536
01:57:28.52 --> 01:57:34.04
You'll make that story good.

2537
01:57:34.04 --> 01:57:36.60
Make that story epic.

2538
01:57:36.60 --> 01:57:42.68
Make that story and make the direction that your life goes.

2539
01:57:42.68 --> 01:57:44.68
Make it.

2540
01:57:44.68 --> 01:57:53.52
And really.

2541
01:57:53.52 --> 01:57:58.48
And that's how I think you can get control.

2542
01:57:58.48 --> 01:58:09.000
Or maybe handle better some of that horrific stuff that you've been through.

2543
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:14.08
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

2544
01:58:14.08 --> 01:58:25.20
So echo Charles speaking of being heroic speaking of controlling our own narrative

2545
01:58:25.20 --> 01:58:28.52
of the past of the present of the future.

2546
01:58:28.52 --> 01:58:36.96
What can we do to write that heroic story for ourselves?

2547
01:58:36.96 --> 01:58:37.96
Yes.

2548
01:58:37.96 --> 01:58:41.68
Well, let's start with the path.

2549
01:58:41.68 --> 01:58:42.96
We're staying on the path.

2550
01:58:42.96 --> 01:58:44.96
We're going to get on the path.

2551
01:58:44.96 --> 01:58:46.96
We're going to be on the path.

2552
01:58:46.96 --> 01:58:51.32
So part of the path is due to, of course, like we've said many times.

2553
01:58:51.32 --> 01:58:52.76
You're going to need a key.

2554
01:58:52.76 --> 01:58:53.76
What do you get?

2555
01:58:53.76 --> 01:58:55.76
I got to interview the other day.

2556
01:58:55.76 --> 01:58:56.76
Cool.

2557
01:58:56.76 --> 01:59:02.20
And the guy kind of sets up this kind of big question.

2558
01:59:02.20 --> 01:59:04.40
He says, you know, in this day and age.

2559
01:59:04.40 --> 01:59:05.64
And I'm not going to do injustice.

2560
01:59:05.64 --> 01:59:06.64
He was a great question.

2561
01:59:06.64 --> 01:59:07.40
It was a nice question.

2562
01:59:07.40 --> 01:59:08.40
I get it.

2563
01:59:08.40 --> 01:59:12.36
And I'm not going to do this eloquently as he did it.

2564
01:59:12.36 --> 01:59:19.000
But the question was about, you know, in this day and age, when men and it was one of those

2565
01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:22.28
like men like type things.

2566
01:59:22.28 --> 01:59:27.24
If they're in age when men can be isolated and can get depressed and don't have

2567
01:59:27.24 --> 01:59:29.24
meaning and all this stuff.

2568
01:59:29.24 --> 01:59:34.76
What do you recommend to men that feel that way, that feel isolated and feel alone

2569
01:59:34.76 --> 01:59:37.68
and feel depressed and feel like they don't have meaning in their life and feel like

2570
01:59:37.68 --> 01:59:38.68
they can't connect with anyone.

2571
01:59:38.68 --> 01:59:39.68
And I was like, oh, cool.

2572
01:59:39.68 --> 01:59:41.12
Yeah, go to Gigietsu classes.

2573
01:59:41.12 --> 01:59:49.40
And I felt bad because they wanted me to give like the big, profound thing about where

2574
01:59:49.40 --> 01:59:52.48
the find meaning in your life.

2575
01:59:52.48 --> 01:59:55.68
And what I said was, yeah, start training Gigietsu because the thing that you grab me

2576
01:59:55.68 --> 01:59:59.56
with is like, oh, you want, you want to have a goal, you want to have meaning, you want

2577
01:59:59.56 --> 02:00:02.44
to connect with people, you don't want to be alone, loneliness and all this stuff.

2578
02:00:02.44 --> 02:00:04.16
I'm like, yeah, yeah, go change Gigietsu.

2579
02:00:04.16 --> 02:00:05.16
Oh, there's problems.

2580
02:00:05.16 --> 02:00:06.16
Get solved right there.

2581
02:00:06.16 --> 02:00:07.16
Right.

2582
02:00:07.16 --> 02:00:08.52
All of a sudden, you got people to hang out with.

2583
02:00:08.52 --> 02:00:09.68
You got a mission.

2584
02:00:09.68 --> 02:00:11.48
You got fitness going on.

2585
02:00:11.48 --> 02:00:12.48
You got meaning.

2586
02:00:12.48 --> 02:00:14.40
It's all kinds of good stuff going on.

2587
02:00:14.40 --> 02:00:15.40
Yeah.

2588
02:00:15.40 --> 02:00:17.16
So go train some Gigietsu is what I'm saying.

2589
02:00:17.16 --> 02:00:18.16
Yeah.

2590
02:00:18.16 --> 02:00:24.64
So start, that's one of those deals to with, you like, you leave Gigietsu with something.

2591
02:00:24.64 --> 02:00:27.40
I'm not just fitness and better health and stuff.

2592
02:00:27.40 --> 02:00:32.88
You leave with like a skill that just feeds into your whole soul, especially man,

2593
02:00:32.88 --> 02:00:38.68
manliness thing, man, the capability to defeat another man.

2594
02:00:38.68 --> 02:00:39.68
Yeah.

2595
02:00:39.68 --> 02:00:44.52
And we'll have to see we'll check in with some of our females because when I talk to our

2596
02:00:44.52 --> 02:00:50.20
female Gigietsu practitioners, they might even feel a little bit better because they

2597
02:00:50.20 --> 02:00:53.04
get to like choke men.

2598
02:00:53.04 --> 02:00:54.40
No doubt about it.

2599
02:00:54.40 --> 02:00:56.60
So yeah.

2600
02:00:56.60 --> 02:00:57.60
Yeah.

2601
02:00:57.60 --> 02:01:00.000
So what we're saying basically is try training some Gigietsu.

2602
02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.96
Look, is it a cure all?

2603
02:01:01.96 --> 02:01:02.96
Yeah.

2604
02:01:02.96 --> 02:01:03.96
Kind of.

2605
02:01:03.96 --> 02:01:04.96
Yeah, little bit.

2606
02:01:04.96 --> 02:01:08.96
For certain people in certain situations, I think, yeah, I think so.

2607
02:01:08.96 --> 02:01:13.64
I have a feeling when I leave Gigietsu after I get done training.

2608
02:01:13.64 --> 02:01:14.64
That I feel good.

2609
02:01:14.64 --> 02:01:15.64
Yes, sir.

2610
02:01:15.64 --> 02:01:17.08
Just think about that.

2611
02:01:17.08 --> 02:01:20.40
Just think about think if I gave you a pill that said, oh, if you just take this pill, you'll

2612
02:01:20.40 --> 02:01:21.40
feel good.

2613
02:01:21.40 --> 02:01:25.000
You just, you just roundlead, you'll just feel good.

2614
02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.36
But there's no, in fact, the only side effects are that you'll be a little healthier

2615
02:01:29.36 --> 02:01:36.60
and you'll have a quality skill that you can utilize in the real world.

2616
02:01:36.60 --> 02:01:37.60
Just take this pill.

2617
02:01:37.60 --> 02:01:39.24
Would you take the pill?

2618
02:01:39.24 --> 02:01:41.28
Who wouldn't?

2619
02:01:41.28 --> 02:01:44.80
What I'm saying is you get to go to Gigietsu.

2620
02:01:44.80 --> 02:01:46.32
Is it harder than taking a pill?

2621
02:01:46.32 --> 02:01:47.32
Sure.

2622
02:01:47.32 --> 02:01:50.52
But is it harder to eat a staker to eat a pill?

2623
02:01:50.52 --> 02:01:51.52
Stake.

2624
02:01:51.52 --> 02:01:53.12
Technically, it's harder to eat a staker.

2625
02:01:53.12 --> 02:01:54.52
Which one would you rather do?

2626
02:01:54.52 --> 02:01:55.52
Eat a staker.

2627
02:01:55.52 --> 02:01:56.52
I'd rather eat a staker.

2628
02:01:56.52 --> 02:01:58.20
I'd rather change a Gigietsu than take a pill.

2629
02:01:58.20 --> 02:01:59.20
Me too.

2630
02:01:59.20 --> 02:02:00.20
So get on that train.

2631
02:02:00.20 --> 02:02:01.20
But you just do train.

2632
02:02:01.20 --> 02:02:02.20
Get on the Gigietsu train.

2633
02:02:02.20 --> 02:02:03.76
And you're going to do Gianno Gigi.

2634
02:02:03.76 --> 02:02:04.92
So what kind of Gigiet to get?

2635
02:02:04.92 --> 02:02:06.40
You get the best Gigi.

2636
02:02:06.40 --> 02:02:07.40
Question.

2637
02:02:07.40 --> 02:02:10.40
I realized I like dramatically interrupting you sometimes.

2638
02:02:10.40 --> 02:02:11.40
Good.

2639
02:02:11.40 --> 02:02:12.40
I dig it to sometimes.

2640
02:02:12.40 --> 02:02:17.40
So Gigi, origin.

2641
02:02:17.40 --> 02:02:18.40
OriginMain.com.

2642
02:02:18.40 --> 02:02:21.84
This is where you can get your Gigi.

2643
02:02:21.84 --> 02:02:23.28
Many different options.

2644
02:02:23.28 --> 02:02:25.88
They come out with new ones as pretty cool.

2645
02:02:25.88 --> 02:02:28.40
It's very creative with that stuff.

2646
02:02:28.40 --> 02:02:30.64
I encourage P to continue that creativity.

2647
02:02:30.64 --> 02:02:32.64
And keep it on that level as well.

2648
02:02:32.64 --> 02:02:33.64
Anyway.

2649
02:02:33.64 --> 02:02:34.64
Don't encourage him.

2650
02:02:34.64 --> 02:02:35.64
Not an encourage.

2651
02:02:35.64 --> 02:02:38.08
All encourage and compliment as well.

2652
02:02:38.08 --> 02:02:40.20
So yes, originMain.com.

2653
02:02:40.20 --> 02:02:43.92
You can get a rash card too if you want.

2654
02:02:43.92 --> 02:02:47.04
Also some shirts on there, some joggers and whatnot.

2655
02:02:47.04 --> 02:02:49.36
Supplements as well.

2656
02:02:49.36 --> 02:02:52.32
What about just for what if you're going to go see a movie?

2657
02:02:52.32 --> 02:02:53.96
Can you wear your Gitu a movie?

2658
02:02:53.96 --> 02:02:56.000
Oh well.

2659
02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.000
No.

2660
02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Okay.

2661
02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:02.40
Can you wear your Gitu a dinner date with your wife?

2662
02:03:02.40 --> 02:03:03.40
No.

2663
02:03:03.40 --> 02:03:04.40
I know.

2664
02:03:04.40 --> 02:03:05.40
You can't.

2665
02:03:05.40 --> 02:03:06.40
So what do we do with origin then?

2666
02:03:06.40 --> 02:03:07.40
All right.

2667
02:03:07.40 --> 02:03:11.12
Well, the good news is we got some American denim.

2668
02:03:11.12 --> 02:03:13.12
We got jeans.

2669
02:03:13.12 --> 02:03:15.12
Yeah, origin jeans.

2670
02:03:15.12 --> 02:03:16.12
Boom.

2671
02:03:16.12 --> 02:03:17.12
Yeah, those are good man.

2672
02:03:17.12 --> 02:03:18.76
Those came out really, really good.

2673
02:03:18.76 --> 02:03:22.000
I think those are going to go to go places.

2674
02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:29.16
This one I will give Pete some leeway for his creativity.

2675
02:03:29.16 --> 02:03:30.16
Or if.

2676
02:03:30.16 --> 02:03:32.96
Because he did this thing with the yoke of the jeans.

2677
02:03:32.96 --> 02:03:33.96
You know the yoke is?

2678
02:03:33.96 --> 02:03:34.96
No.

2679
02:03:34.96 --> 02:03:37.72
It's like right below the waistband.

2680
02:03:37.72 --> 02:03:39.88
And there's two types of different yokes you can have.

2681
02:03:39.88 --> 02:03:42.44
Reverse yoke or regular yoke, I guess it's called.

2682
02:03:42.44 --> 02:03:46.72
Anyways, it makes it so that the pants fit a certain way.

2683
02:03:46.72 --> 02:03:51.76
And then he lined up the tops of the pockets with the reverse yoke, which means that

2684
02:03:51.76 --> 02:03:53.40
they're slanted a little bit.

2685
02:03:53.40 --> 02:03:57.76
Like the old school Vietnam pockets.

2686
02:03:57.76 --> 02:04:00.80
So anyways, that's cool.

2687
02:04:00.80 --> 02:04:01.80
They're legit.

2688
02:04:01.80 --> 02:04:03.40
Yeah, they're just like a little bit.

2689
02:04:03.40 --> 02:04:05.20
You know what I got there and tails going on.

2690
02:04:05.20 --> 02:04:08.76
I'm gathering that you're starting to appreciate Pete's fashion sense.

2691
02:04:08.76 --> 02:04:09.76
That's what I'm gathering.

2692
02:04:09.76 --> 02:04:10.76
Great.

2693
02:04:10.76 --> 02:04:13.24
You're saying occasionally, no, no, no, no, because here's the deal.

2694
02:04:13.24 --> 02:04:18.96
The pockets because they're at a little angle, they're easier to get your hand

2695
02:04:18.96 --> 02:04:24.16
in an out of, which what I'm saying is there is a functionality.

2696
02:04:24.16 --> 02:04:27.56
Because if it wasn't functional, I wouldn't be talking about it right now.

2697
02:04:27.56 --> 02:04:28.56
No.

2698
02:04:28.56 --> 02:04:29.56
Because we don't talk about things like that.

2699
02:04:29.56 --> 02:04:31.16
But they look dope this one saying.

2700
02:04:31.16 --> 02:04:34.16
Yeah, thank you, sir.

2701
02:04:34.16 --> 02:04:35.16
And appreciate that on a lot of things.

2702
02:04:35.16 --> 02:04:37.92
I think Pete did it not for functionality.

2703
02:04:37.92 --> 02:04:40.96
I think Pete did it because it looked cool.

2704
02:04:40.96 --> 02:04:47.36
And then I commend his creativity because not because it looked cool, but because it

2705
02:04:47.36 --> 02:04:52.88
provides a level of functionality that does not previously exist in jeans anywhere.

2706
02:04:52.88 --> 02:04:53.88
Boom.

2707
02:04:53.88 --> 02:04:55.36
So I agree with you.

2708
02:04:55.36 --> 02:04:58.36
I agree with the whole deal, the whole gig and man.

2709
02:04:58.36 --> 02:04:59.36
Yeah, yeah.

2710
02:04:59.36 --> 02:05:01.36
Those are good American denim.

2711
02:05:01.36 --> 02:05:02.36
But they're all made in America.

2712
02:05:02.36 --> 02:05:03.36
Yes.

2713
02:05:03.36 --> 02:05:04.36
The cotton is made in America.

2714
02:05:04.36 --> 02:05:05.36
Grown.

2715
02:05:05.36 --> 02:05:09.96
What about the things that you put, you're fast in the, you're waste with the buttons?

2716
02:05:09.96 --> 02:05:10.96
Yeah, the buttons.

2717
02:05:10.96 --> 02:05:13.96
We're in buttons in.

2718
02:05:13.96 --> 02:05:15.76
Just look at a picture of the buttons.

2719
02:05:15.76 --> 02:05:18.76
That's enough to be like all sold to begin with.

2720
02:05:18.76 --> 02:05:19.76
They're pretty dope.

2721
02:05:19.76 --> 02:05:20.76
They're very dope.

2722
02:05:20.76 --> 02:05:22.96
Actually, plus we got supplements as you were just about to say.

2723
02:05:22.96 --> 02:05:23.96
Yes, supplements.

2724
02:05:23.96 --> 02:05:24.96
Important supplements.

2725
02:05:24.96 --> 02:05:26.96
Not this mega mast.

2726
02:05:26.96 --> 02:05:28.96
What was that one from old school?

2727
02:05:28.96 --> 02:05:29.96
Mega mast.

2728
02:05:29.96 --> 02:05:30.96
I don't know.

2729
02:05:30.96 --> 02:05:31.96
It was a big number.

2730
02:05:31.96 --> 02:05:32.96
The last, not like that.

2731
02:05:32.96 --> 02:05:39.96
Well, I guess kind of because milk is additional, but wait, cleaner, clean, protein, slow release.

2732
02:05:39.96 --> 02:05:43.36
Brighten did a really good, um, but let's face it.

2733
02:05:43.36 --> 02:05:44.36
It just tastes good.

2734
02:05:44.36 --> 02:05:45.36
Yes.

2735
02:05:45.36 --> 02:05:46.36
Well, it doesn't just taste it.

2736
02:05:46.36 --> 02:05:47.36
It tastes good.

2737
02:05:47.36 --> 02:05:50.12
That might be, uh, what's that word?

2738
02:05:50.12 --> 02:05:53.64
That might be the number one priority or the number one benefit.

2739
02:05:53.64 --> 02:05:57.24
The fact that it's the best protein you can actually get is awesome too.

2740
02:05:57.24 --> 02:05:58.24
Yeah.

2741
02:05:58.24 --> 02:05:58.92
Cool.

2742
02:05:58.92 --> 02:06:00.92
You need to take if you want protein as well.

2743
02:06:00.92 --> 02:06:03.04
So there's, there's very good always eat a steak.

2744
02:06:03.04 --> 02:06:04.04
That's the problem.

2745
02:06:04.04 --> 02:06:05.68
Sometimes you're like on the go.

2746
02:06:05.68 --> 02:06:07.04
Sometimes you got to get.

2747
02:06:07.04 --> 02:06:09.04
Sometimes it's, you got work to do.

2748
02:06:09.04 --> 02:06:10.04
Yeah.

2749
02:06:10.04 --> 02:06:11.04
You have time to eat a steak.

2750
02:06:11.04 --> 02:06:12.64
Sometimes you just want to dessert too.

2751
02:06:12.64 --> 02:06:13.64
Let's face it.

2752
02:06:13.64 --> 02:06:15.32
Come on bro, let's face it.

2753
02:06:15.32 --> 02:06:16.32
So boom.

2754
02:06:16.32 --> 02:06:17.32
There you go.

2755
02:06:17.32 --> 02:06:21.44
So yeah, some milk is like that, but the joint warfare, krill oil, these are for

2756
02:06:21.44 --> 02:06:22.44
your joints.

2757
02:06:22.44 --> 02:06:23.72
Keep your joints in the game.

2758
02:06:23.72 --> 02:06:28.68
If you're for real getting after it, like, especially in the gym and doing judi-to, man,

2759
02:06:28.68 --> 02:06:32.000
those, the joint warfare and the krill oil is going to keep you in the game big times.

2760
02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:33.44
It's going to help you out alive.

2761
02:06:33.44 --> 02:06:36.16
Huge time as we say.

2762
02:06:36.16 --> 02:06:38.08
Don't forget about the warrior kid milk as well.

2763
02:06:38.08 --> 02:06:39.08
Yeah.

2764
02:06:39.08 --> 02:06:41.80
Which is, which is tasty.

2765
02:06:41.80 --> 02:06:47.96
And why not feed your kid something that's actually going to be good for them instead of feeding

2766
02:06:47.96 --> 02:06:50.44
them literal poison.

2767
02:06:50.44 --> 02:06:51.44
Yeah.

2768
02:06:51.44 --> 02:06:52.44
Come me bears.

2769
02:06:52.44 --> 02:06:53.44
Yeah.

2770
02:06:53.44 --> 02:06:54.44
Sugar for a shock.

2771
02:06:54.44 --> 02:06:55.44
Correct.

2772
02:06:55.44 --> 02:06:59.96
Discipline as well.

2773
02:06:59.96 --> 02:07:02.76
If you want some cognitive enhancing elements infused into your brain, get some discipline.

2774
02:07:02.76 --> 02:07:03.76
That's a good one.

2775
02:07:03.76 --> 02:07:05.32
Get yourself some jocquoise tea as well.

2776
02:07:05.32 --> 02:07:06.32
Yeah.

2777
02:07:06.32 --> 02:07:10.56
That's if you want to have a massive deadlift and excessive 8,000 pounds.

2778
02:07:10.56 --> 02:07:11.56
Check.

2779
02:07:11.56 --> 02:07:12.56
Yeah.

2780
02:07:12.56 --> 02:07:13.56
Also, it's certified organic.

2781
02:07:13.56 --> 02:07:14.56
So that's something.

2782
02:07:14.56 --> 02:07:16.20
Also, what the store?

2783
02:07:16.20 --> 02:07:17.60
It's called jocquoise store.

2784
02:07:17.60 --> 02:07:19.36
We can get the tea on the store too.

2785
02:07:19.36 --> 02:07:22.44
We have the tea on the store.

2786
02:07:22.44 --> 02:07:25.000
But also on the store, jocquoise store.com.

2787
02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:26.68
This is where you can get shirts.

2788
02:07:26.68 --> 02:07:31.76
If you want to represent on the path, this will even get after it.

2789
02:07:31.76 --> 02:07:32.76
Simple stuff.

2790
02:07:32.76 --> 02:07:38.72
I chose quality shirts over cheap quantity.

2791
02:07:38.72 --> 02:07:39.72
Sure.

2792
02:07:39.72 --> 02:07:42.20
So when you get this shirt, it should be.

2793
02:07:42.20 --> 02:07:43.20
As it should be.

2794
02:07:43.20 --> 02:07:44.20
Right.

2795
02:07:44.20 --> 02:07:48.40
So if you get this shirt and you recognize that dang, this could very well be my favorite

2796
02:07:48.40 --> 02:07:49.72
shirt just to wear.

2797
02:07:49.72 --> 02:07:51.52
Just the fit in the field.

2798
02:07:51.52 --> 02:07:52.52
The shirt.

2799
02:07:52.52 --> 02:07:53.52
I won't be surprised.

2800
02:07:53.52 --> 02:07:54.52
In fact, I'm used to it.

2801
02:07:54.52 --> 02:07:55.52
That's my opinion.

2802
02:07:55.52 --> 02:07:57.80
The last is good stuff on there.

2803
02:07:57.80 --> 02:07:59.04
There's rash guards in there.

2804
02:07:59.04 --> 02:08:00.04
Some hats.

2805
02:08:00.04 --> 02:08:03.44
Flex fit and snap back trucker hats.

2806
02:08:03.44 --> 02:08:06.44
Some hoodies, lightweight and heavyweight.

2807
02:08:06.44 --> 02:08:07.44
Some good stuff on there.

2808
02:08:07.44 --> 02:08:09.28
Anyway, if you want something, get something.

2809
02:08:09.28 --> 02:08:11.64
It is jocquoise store.com.

2810
02:08:11.64 --> 02:08:15.40
Also, don't forget to subscribe to this podcast.

2811
02:08:15.40 --> 02:08:19.000
If you want to go ahead and smash the subscribe button.

2812
02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:20.96
I'm probably not doing that anymore.

2813
02:08:20.96 --> 02:08:21.96
That's it.

2814
02:08:21.96 --> 02:08:22.96
That's that jocquiver.

2815
02:08:22.96 --> 02:08:23.96
That was the last one.

2816
02:08:23.96 --> 02:08:24.96
No more.

2817
02:08:24.96 --> 02:08:30.96
So if you want to subscribe, you can click the subscribe button.

2818
02:08:30.96 --> 02:08:36.20
I guess if you're going to remind someone to do something in regards to subscribing, it

2819
02:08:36.20 --> 02:08:38.88
would be more on the YouTube thing to do the notification bell.

2820
02:08:38.88 --> 02:08:42.80
If they want to be notified, because that's not just a given when you subscribe.

2821
02:08:42.80 --> 02:08:43.80
I don't know.

2822
02:08:43.80 --> 02:08:44.80
Some people might not know that.

2823
02:08:44.80 --> 02:08:45.80
This is what I'm saying.

2824
02:08:45.80 --> 02:08:47.84
I'm definitely a more person that did not know that.

2825
02:08:47.84 --> 02:08:48.84
Well, there you go.

2826
02:08:48.84 --> 02:08:50.24
Oh, so yeah, subscribe.

2827
02:08:50.24 --> 02:08:51.24
Whatever.

2828
02:08:51.24 --> 02:08:52.24
Twitter or not Twitter.

2829
02:08:52.24 --> 02:08:53.24
Sorry.

2830
02:08:53.24 --> 02:08:54.24
Hopefully I do this kind of stuff.

2831
02:08:54.24 --> 02:08:55.24
Yeah.

2832
02:08:55.24 --> 02:08:58.52
Also, don't forget to wear a kid podcast.

2833
02:08:58.52 --> 02:08:59.52
Three new releases.

2834
02:08:59.52 --> 02:09:02.52
No, 24, 25 and 26.

2835
02:09:02.52 --> 02:09:09.44
Including an interview with John Bozac, the illustrator, the drawer of pictures of all

2836
02:09:09.44 --> 02:09:11.88
the worry kid books, including Mikey on the dragons.

2837
02:09:11.88 --> 02:09:14.16
Anyway, yeah, very interesting on that one.

2838
02:09:14.16 --> 02:09:17.68
Especially if you're entertaining kind of creative thing, a kind of demonstrate to the

2839
02:09:17.68 --> 02:09:19.88
talks about the process and the frustration.

2840
02:09:19.88 --> 02:09:20.88
Good.

2841
02:09:20.88 --> 02:09:22.80
I actually liked it a lot.

2842
02:09:22.80 --> 02:09:28.92
So where you could soap Irish Oaks Ranch.com.

2843
02:09:28.92 --> 02:09:34.26
This is where you can get Jocco soap, trooper soap, all made by Warrior Kid 8 in in the

2844
02:09:34.26 --> 02:09:35.36
United States, by the way.

2845
02:09:35.36 --> 02:09:38.32
Does you have some kind of motto or anything with that?

2846
02:09:38.32 --> 02:09:39.72
Yeah, like it's a slogan.

2847
02:09:39.72 --> 02:09:41.72
Well, it's slogan.

2848
02:09:41.72 --> 02:09:42.72
Stay clean.

2849
02:09:42.72 --> 02:09:43.72
Sorry about it.

2850
02:09:43.72 --> 02:09:45.72
I don't say it all like to go crazy.

2851
02:09:45.72 --> 02:09:46.72
Like you, whatever.

2852
02:09:46.72 --> 02:09:48.64
But best stay clean simple to the point, right?

2853
02:09:48.64 --> 02:09:49.64
Yeah.

2854
02:09:49.64 --> 02:09:50.64
Oh, good.

2855
02:09:50.64 --> 02:09:51.64
I was not impressed with that.

2856
02:09:51.64 --> 02:09:52.64
I know.

2857
02:09:52.64 --> 02:09:53.64
I've never done a job there.

2858
02:09:53.64 --> 02:09:55.72
I'm doing the best stay can.

2859
02:09:55.72 --> 02:09:58.76
You know, anyway, like I mentioned, we have a YouTube channel as well.

2860
02:09:58.76 --> 02:09:59.76
Jocco podcast YouTube channel.

2861
02:09:59.76 --> 02:10:06.08
If you were interested in the video version of this, this here situation.

2862

And some excerpts on there.

2863
02:10:07.08 --> 02:10:08.56
Some enhanced excerpts on there too.

2864
02:10:08.56 --> 02:10:11.12
If you want to look at them, it's good.

2865
02:10:11.12 --> 02:10:12.12
Psychological Warfare.

2866
02:10:12.12 --> 02:10:13.44
It's out there.

2867
02:10:13.44 --> 02:10:16.64
iTunes, Google Play, MP3, get it.

2868
02:10:16.64 --> 02:10:22.28
Don't forget about the visual versions of psychological warfare from flipsidekampus.com,

2869
02:10:22.28 --> 02:10:26.20
which is run by my brother Dakota Meyer.

2870
02:10:26.20 --> 02:10:28.72
You might want to check that one out as well.

2871
02:10:28.72 --> 02:10:31.52
If this plenty goes freedom.

2872
02:10:31.52 --> 02:10:33.52
Art.

2873
02:10:33.52 --> 02:10:34.52
Yeah.

2874
02:10:34.52 --> 02:10:36.60
Yeah, we have posters, right?

2875
02:10:36.60 --> 02:10:37.60
Which is cool.

2876
02:10:37.60 --> 02:10:38.88
Like you're hanging your gym and whatever.

2877
02:10:38.88 --> 02:10:41.60
But it's like one, two, maybe three levels higher than the poster.

2878
02:10:41.60 --> 02:10:44.76
It's like, you know, the pen you hang on your wall in your home.

2879
02:10:44.76 --> 02:10:46.84
You've got it in your office.

2880
02:10:46.84 --> 02:10:48.84
Clearly, you could put these things up there.

2881
02:10:48.84 --> 02:10:53.88
We got some warrior kid posters, art, and as well.

2882
02:10:53.88 --> 02:10:54.88
They're not just posters.

2883
02:10:54.88 --> 02:10:58.92
They're like, yeah, the quality.

2884
02:10:58.92 --> 02:11:01.56
Also on it, on it.com slash juggle.

2885
02:11:01.56 --> 02:11:02.56
Go to the case.

2886
02:11:02.56 --> 02:11:06.60
On it, this is where you can get what kettlebells, like fitness stuff.

2887
02:11:06.60 --> 02:11:10.16
So you know, some cool supplements, some greens, some food items.

2888
02:11:10.16 --> 02:11:12.60
You know, this is where I get my kettlebells.

2889
02:11:12.60 --> 02:11:17.76
But actually, yeah, like pretty much all my home gym stuff aside from like the dumbbells

2890
02:11:17.76 --> 02:11:18.76
sets.

2891
02:11:18.76 --> 02:11:19.76
Get from on it.

2892
02:11:19.76 --> 02:11:20.76
All of it.

2893
02:11:20.76 --> 02:11:22.76
Go on there on it.com slash juggle.

2894
02:11:22.76 --> 02:11:23.76
Get something.

2895
02:11:23.76 --> 02:11:24.76
And got some books too.

2896
02:11:24.76 --> 02:11:26.76
I've written a bunch of them.

2897
02:11:26.76 --> 02:11:27.76
Way the warrior kid.

2898
02:11:27.76 --> 02:11:29.76
Where there's a will.

2899
02:11:29.76 --> 02:11:31.48
Number, that's number three of that book.

2900
02:11:31.48 --> 02:11:32.48
That is live.

2901
02:11:32.48 --> 02:11:36.60
So get that for your kid.

2902
02:11:36.60 --> 02:11:39.52
Also get the way the warrior kid won and way the warrior kid too, which is called marks

2903
02:11:39.52 --> 02:11:40.52
mission.

2904
02:11:40.52 --> 02:11:41.52
These books are good.

2905
02:11:41.52 --> 02:11:43.52
And these are the books I wish I had when I was a kid.

2906
02:11:43.52 --> 02:11:46.68
They would just put me on the path that a younger age.

2907
02:11:46.68 --> 02:11:51.52
Like in the dragons, you can order that one now as well.

2908
02:11:51.52 --> 02:11:57.16
That is for a little bit younger age, maybe three, four, five, six.

2909
02:11:57.16 --> 02:11:58.16
Sure, through 70.

2910
02:11:58.16 --> 02:12:00.40
Yeah, I would agree with that.

2911
02:12:00.40 --> 02:12:03.24
Yeah, just want to go to Freedom Field Manual.

2912
02:12:03.24 --> 02:12:07.60
All the little questions that you want to ask me about everything are answered in that

2913
02:12:07.60 --> 02:12:09.80
book.

2914
02:12:09.80 --> 02:12:11.56
The discipline was Freedom Field Manual.

2915
02:12:11.56 --> 02:12:13.12
How to get after it.

2916
02:12:13.12 --> 02:12:16.24
The audio version is not unautable.

2917
02:12:16.24 --> 02:12:17.24
It's on iTunes.

2918
02:12:17.24 --> 02:12:18.24
It's on Amazon Music.

2919
02:12:18.24 --> 02:12:19.24
It's on Google Play.

2920
02:12:19.24 --> 02:12:20.84
Other MP3s.

2921
02:12:20.84 --> 02:12:27.68
And those are questions that you might have about life about my personal operating system.

2922
02:12:27.68 --> 02:12:31.12
If you have questions about leadership, check out Extreme Ownership and the dichotomy

2923
02:12:31.12 --> 02:12:32.12
leadership.

2924
02:12:32.12 --> 02:12:38.04
I referenced them both today and I referenced them all the time written by me and my brother

2925
02:12:38.04 --> 02:12:40.96
Lave Babin about the experiences we had overseas.

2926
02:12:40.96 --> 02:12:46.20
Now, you can take those experiences and apply them to the leadership in your

2927
02:12:46.20 --> 02:12:48.68
life and world.

2928
02:12:48.68 --> 02:12:52.48
We also have Eshelon Front, which is our leadership consultancy.

2929
02:12:52.48 --> 02:12:54.20
We solve problems through leadership.

2930
02:12:54.20 --> 02:12:57.20
You can go to Eshelonfront.com for details on that.

2931
02:12:57.20 --> 02:13:02.80
If you want to get some additional training online, you go to EF Online.com.

02:13:08.76 --> 02:13:10.68
Interactive classes.

Check that one out.

2935
02:13:11.68 --> 02:13:14.32
If you want to go more granular.

2936
02:13:14.32 --> 02:13:21.56
And then we have the master, which is a conference gathering, a leadership gathering.

2937
02:13:21.56 --> 02:13:25.88
The next one is in Denver, September 19th and 20th.

2938
02:13:25.88 --> 02:13:30.80
And then in Sydney, Australia, December 4th and 5th, check Extreme Ownership.com for

2939
02:13:30.80 --> 02:13:31.80
details.

2940
02:13:31.80 --> 02:13:34.84
All of the masters have sold out and these will too.

2941
02:13:34.84 --> 02:13:38.04
So get there early.

2942
02:13:38.04 --> 02:13:49.28
Of course, we have EF Overwatch where we are taking spec ops and combat aviation leaders

2943
02:13:49.28 --> 02:13:53.16
and placing them into civilian companies that need leader.

2944
02:13:53.16 --> 02:13:54.80
Ship.

2945
02:13:54.80 --> 02:13:56.68
EF Overwatch.com.

2946
02:13:56.68 --> 02:14:02.68
If you want to hire someone from special operations or your former special operations

2947
02:14:02.68 --> 02:14:07.24
and you would like to work in the civilian sector, go to EF Overwatch.com, follow the

2948
02:14:07.24 --> 02:14:11.24
instructor and we will hook it up.

2949
02:14:11.24 --> 02:14:15.72
And if you feel like you want to cruise with us just a little bit more, you can find

2950
02:14:15.72 --> 02:14:19.84
us both on the Interwebs.

2951
02:14:19.84 --> 02:14:25.72
On Twitter, on Instagram, and on the Vais Book.

2952
02:14:25.72 --> 02:14:29.32
Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocca Willink.

2953
02:14:29.32 --> 02:14:35.64
And thanks to all of you that make this podcast possible first.

2954
02:14:35.64 --> 02:14:40.52
As of you in the armed services who put your honor and duty above yourselves and protect

2955
02:14:40.52 --> 02:14:46.36
freedom around the world and to all the police officers and law enforcement to the firefighters,

2956
02:14:46.36 --> 02:14:52.92
the paramedics, the EMTs, the dispatchers, the correctional officers, the Border Patrol,

2957
02:14:52.92 --> 02:14:57.32
Secret Service and all the other first responders.

2958
02:14:57.32 --> 02:15:00.64
Each of you do the same.

2959
02:15:00.64 --> 02:15:07.76
You place the welfare of others above the welfare of yourself in order to keep us safe.

2960
02:15:07.76 --> 02:15:10.72
So thanks for what you do.

2961
02:15:10.72 --> 02:15:16.48
And the rest of you that are out there, thanks for the support that you all give us.

2962
02:15:16.48 --> 02:15:21.76
You are the fuel that keeps this train moving.

2963
02:15:21.76 --> 02:15:24.20
Literally, we appreciate it.

2964
02:15:24.20 --> 02:15:34.72
And also remember this no matter what happened in the past, you control the narrative.

2965
02:15:34.72 --> 02:15:37.32
You write the story that you want to write.

2966
02:15:37.32 --> 02:15:40.68
You give yourself the role that you want.

2967
02:15:40.68 --> 02:15:49.88
Make your thoughts in that story filled with discipline and make your actions.

2968
02:15:49.88 --> 02:15:56.08
Make them nothing short of heroic.

2969
02:15:56.08 --> 02:16:02.20
Then step out into the world and get after it.

2970
02:16:02.20 --> 02:16:06.60
Until next time, this is Echo and Jocco.

2971
02:16:06.60 --> 02:16:23.46
And now.
