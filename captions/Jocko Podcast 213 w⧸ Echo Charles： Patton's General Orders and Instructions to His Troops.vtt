00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 213 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Good evening, echo.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Good evening.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Men.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This stuff that some sources sling around about America wanting out of this war,

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
not wanting to fight, is a crock of bullshit.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Americans love to fight traditionally.

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
All Americans love this sting and clash of battle.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You are here today for three reasons.

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
First, because you are here to defend your homes and your loved ones.

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Second, you are here for your own self-respect,

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
because you would not want to be anywhere else.

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Third, you are here because you are real men,

14
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and all real men like to fight.

15
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
When you hear every one of you or kids,

16
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
you all admired the champion marble player, the fastest runner, the toughest boxer,

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
the big league ball players, and the all-American football players.

18
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Americans love a winner.

19
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Americans will not tolerate a loser.

20
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Americans despise cowards.

21
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Americans play to win all of the time.

22
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I wouldn't give a hoot and hell for a man who lost and laughed.

23
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
That's why Americans have never lost nor will ever lose a war.

24
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
For the very idea of losing is hateful to an American.

25
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You are not all going to die.

26
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Only 2% of you right here today would die in major battle.

27
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Death must not be feared.

28
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Death in time comes to all men.

29
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Yes, every man is scared in his first battle.

30
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
If he says he's not, he's a liar.

31
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Some men are cowards, but they fight the same as brave men,

32
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
or they get to hell slammed out of them watching men fight,

33
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
who are just as scared as they are.

34
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The real hero is the man who fights even though he is scared.

35
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Some men get over their fright and amitted under fire.

36
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
For some it takes an hour, for some it takes days,

37
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
but a real man will never let his fear of death overpower his honor,

38
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
his sense of duty to his country, and his innate manhood.

39
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being can indulge.

40
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
It brings out all that is the best, and it removes all that is base.

41
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Americans pride themselves on being he men, and they are he men.

42
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Remember that the enemy is just as frightened as you are, and probably more so.

43
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
They are not supermen.

44
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
All through your army careers, you men have bitched about what you call chicken shit drilling.

45
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
That, like everything else in the army, has a definite purpose.

46
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
That purpose is alertness.

47
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
A alertness must be bred into every soldier.

48
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I don't give a fuck for a man who's not always on his toes.

49
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
You men are veterans, or you wouldn't be here.

50
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
You are ready for what's to come.

51
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
A man must be alerted all times if he expects to stay alive.

52
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
If you're not alert, sometimes a German son of an asshole bitch is going to sneak up behind you

53
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and beat you to death with a sock full of shit.

54
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
There are 400 neatly marked graves somewhere in Sicily, all because one man went to sleep on the job.

55
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
But they're German graves because we caught the bastard asleep before they did.

56
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
An army is a team.

57
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It lives, sleeps, eats, and fights as a team.

58
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
This individual heroic stuff is pure horseshit.

59
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The biolist bastard who write that kind of stuff for the Saturday evening post.

60
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Don't know anything more about real fighting under fire than they do about fucking.

61
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
We have the finest food, the finest equipment, the best spirit, and the best men in the world.

62
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Why?

63
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
By God, I actually pity those poor sons of bitches we're going up against.

64
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
By God, I do.

65
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
My men don't surrender.

66
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I don't want to hear of any soldier under my command being captured unless he's been hit.

67
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Even if you are hit, you can still fight back.

68
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
That's not just bullshit, either.

69
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
The kind of man that I want my command is just like the Lieutenant in Libya.

70
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Who, with a luger against his chest, jerked off his helmet, swept the gun aside with one hand,

71
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and busted the hell out of the crowd with his helmet.

72
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Then he jumped on the gun and went out and killed another German before they knew what the hell was coming off.

73
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And all that time, this man had a bullet through along.

74
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
There was a real man.

75
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
All of the heroes are not storybook combat fighters, either.

76
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Every single man in this army plays a vital role.

77
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Don't ever let up.

78
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Don't ever think that your job is unimportant.

79
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Every man has a job to do and he must do it.

80
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Every man has a vital link in the great chain.

81
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
What if every truck driver suddenly decided that he didn't like the wine of those shells overhead,

82
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
turned yellow and jumped headlong into a ditch?

83
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
The cowardly bastard would say, hell, they won't miss me.

84
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Just one man in thousands.

85
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
But what if every man thought that way?

86
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Where the hell will we be now?

87
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
What what our country, our loved ones, our homes, even the world be like,

88
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
no, God damn it.

89
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Americans don't think like that.

90
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Every man does his job.

91
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Every man serves the whole.

92
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Every department, every unit is important in the vast scheme of this war.

93
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
The ordinance man are needed to supply the guns and machinery of war to keep us rolling.

94
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
The quartermaster is needed to bring up food and clothes because where we are going,

95
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
there is no hell of a lot to steal.

96
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Every last man on K.P. has a job to do, even the one who heats our water to keep us from getting the GI shits.

97
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Each man must not think only of himself, but also of his buddy fighting beside him.

98
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
We don't want yellow cowards in this army.

99
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
They should be killed off like rats.

100
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
If not, they will go home after this war and breed more cowards.

101
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
The brave men will breed more brave men.

102
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Kill off the goddamn cowards and we will have a nation of brave men.

103
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000
One of the bravest men I ever saw was a fellow on top of a telegraph pole in the midst of a furious firefighting Tunisia.

104
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I stopped and asked what the hell he was doing up there at a time like that.

105
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
He answered, fixing the wire, sir.

106
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I asked isn't it a little unhealthy right about now?

107
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
He answered, yes, sir, but the goddamn wire has to be fixed.

108
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I asked, don't those planes strafe in the road, bother you?

109
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And he answered, no, sir, but you sure as hell do.

110
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Now there was a real man, a real soldier.

111
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:42.000
There was a man who devoted all he had to his duty, no matter how seemingly insignificant his duty might appear at the time, no matter how great the odds.

112
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And you should have seen those trucks on the road to Tunisia.

113
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Those drivers were magnificent.

114
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:58.000
All day and all night they rolled over those son of a bitch and roads, never stopping, never faltering from their course, with shells bursting all around them all the time.

115
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
We got through on good old American guts.

116
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Many of those men drove for over 40 consecutive hours.

117
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
These men weren't combat men, but they were soldiers with a job to do.

118
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
They did it.

119
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And they want to hell of a way.

120
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
They did it.

121
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
They were part of a team.

122
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Without team effort, without them, the fight would have been lost.

123
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.000
All of the links in the chain pulled together and the chain became unbreakable.

124
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Don't forget, you men don't know that I'm here.

125
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
No mention of that fact is to be made in any letters.

126
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
The world is not supposed to know what the hell happened to me.

127
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I'm not supposed to be commanding this army.

128
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I'm not even supposed to be here in England.

129
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Let the first bastards to find out be the goddamn Germans.

130
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Some day I want to see them raise up on their piss, soaked, tiny legs and how Jesus Christ.

131
00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
It's the goddamn third army again and that son of a fucking bitch patent.

132
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
We want to get the hell over there.

133
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.40
The quicker we clean up this goddamn mess, the quicker we can take a little junk against the

134
00:09:08.40 --> 00:09:11.72
purple pissing japs and clean out their nest too.

135
00:09:11.72 --> 00:09:15.000
Before the goddamn Marines get all the credit.

136
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.24
Sure, we want to go home.

137
00:09:17.24 --> 00:09:18.68
We want this war over with.

138
00:09:18.68 --> 00:09:23.60
The quickest way to get it over with is to get the bastards who started it.

139
00:09:23.60 --> 00:09:27.44
The quicker they are whipped, the quicker we can go home.

140
00:09:27.44 --> 00:09:31.88
The shortest way home is through Berlin and Tokyo.

141
00:09:31.88 --> 00:09:36.16
And when we get to Berlin, I am personally going to shoot that paper hanging son of a

142
00:09:36.16 --> 00:09:37.68
bitch Hitler.

143
00:09:37.68 --> 00:09:41.72
Just like I'd shoot a snake.

144
00:09:41.72 --> 00:09:47.04
When a man is lying in a shell hole, if he just stays there all day, a German will get

145
00:09:47.04 --> 00:09:48.92
to him eventually.

146
00:09:48.92 --> 00:09:50.68
The hell with that idea?

147
00:09:50.68 --> 00:09:52.28
The hell with taking it.

148
00:09:52.28 --> 00:09:53.92
My men don't dig foxholes.

149
00:09:53.92 --> 00:09:55.92
I don't want them to.

150
00:09:55.92 --> 00:09:57.64
Foxholes only slow up an offensive.

151
00:09:57.64 --> 00:09:59.12
Keep moving.

152
00:09:59.12 --> 00:10:02.32
Don't give the enemy time to dig one either.

153
00:10:02.32 --> 00:10:06.44
Will win this war, but will win it only by fighting and by showing the Germans that we

154
00:10:06.44 --> 00:10:10.96
got more guts than they have or will ever have.

155
00:10:10.96 --> 00:10:13.20
We're not just going to shoot the sons of bitches.

156
00:10:13.20 --> 00:10:17.04
We're going to rip out their living goddamn guts and use them to grease the treads of

157
00:10:17.04 --> 00:10:18.80
our tanks.

158
00:10:18.80 --> 00:10:24.44
We're going to murder those lousy, hung cock suckers by the Bush-of-fucking basket.

159
00:10:24.44 --> 00:10:27.32
War is a bloody killing business.

160
00:10:27.32 --> 00:10:30.96
You've got to spill their blood or they will spill yours.

161
00:10:30.96 --> 00:10:32.16
rip them up, baby.

162
00:10:32.16 --> 00:10:34.36
Shoot them in the guts.

163
00:10:34.36 --> 00:10:38.72
When shells are hitting all around you and you wipe the dirt off your face and realize

164
00:10:38.72 --> 00:10:42.80
that instead of dirt, it's the blood and guts of what was once your best friend beside

165
00:10:42.80 --> 00:10:47.24
you, you'll know what to do.

166
00:10:47.24 --> 00:10:51.84
I don't want to get any messages saying I am holding my position.

167
00:10:51.84 --> 00:10:53.48
We are not holding the goddamn thing.

168
00:10:53.48 --> 00:10:55.000
Let the Germans do that.

169
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.24
We are advancing constantly and we are not interested in holding onto anything except

170
00:10:59.24 --> 00:11:01.12
the enemy's balls.

171
00:11:01.12 --> 00:11:05.68
We are going to twist his balls and kick the living shit out of them all the time.

172
00:11:05.68 --> 00:11:09.80
Our basic plan of operation is to advance and keep advancing regardless of whether we have

173
00:11:09.80 --> 00:11:12.12
to go over under or through the enemy.

174
00:11:12.12 --> 00:11:19.72
We're going to go through him like crap through a goose, like shit through a tin horn.

175
00:11:19.72 --> 00:11:25.40
From time to time there will be some complaints that we are pushing our people too hard.

176
00:11:25.40 --> 00:11:28.60
I don't give up good goddamn about such complaints.

177
00:11:28.60 --> 00:11:33.24
I believe in the old sound rule that an ounce of sweat will save a gallon of blood.

178
00:11:33.24 --> 00:11:36.96
The harder we push, the more Germans we will kill.

179
00:11:36.96 --> 00:11:41.24
The more Germans we kill, the fewer of our men will be killed.

180
00:11:41.24 --> 00:11:43.24
Pushing means fewer casualties.

181
00:11:43.24 --> 00:11:48.52
I want you all to remember that.

182
00:11:48.52 --> 00:11:52.84
There is one great thing that you men will all be able to say after this war is over and

183
00:11:52.84 --> 00:11:54.52
you are home once again.

184
00:11:54.52 --> 00:12:00.60
You will be thankful that 20 years from now when you are sitting by the fireplace with your

185
00:12:00.60 --> 00:12:07.76
grandson on your knee and he asked you what you did in the great World War II.

186
00:12:07.76 --> 00:12:14.76
You won't have to cough, shift him to the other knee and say, well, your granddaddy shovel

187
00:12:14.76 --> 00:12:19.000
shit in Louisiana.

188
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.32
You can look him straight in the eye and say, son, your granddaddy rode with the great third

189
00:12:25.32 --> 00:12:33.36
army and a son of a goddamn bitch named Georgie Patton.

190
00:12:33.36 --> 00:12:37.92
You sons of bitches, you all know how I feel.

191
00:12:37.92 --> 00:12:46.56
I'll be proud to lead you wonderful guys in battle anytime, anywhere.

192
00:12:46.56 --> 00:12:55.52
That is all.

193
00:12:55.52 --> 00:13:07.88
And that speech was delivered in June of 1944, clearly by General George S. Patton.

194
00:13:07.88 --> 00:13:15.40
In England, and he actually delivered that speech multiple times and this is one version

195
00:13:15.40 --> 00:13:18.64
of it.

196
00:13:18.64 --> 00:13:22.88
George Patton, if you don't know who it is, podcast 9, we covered his book, War as I

197
00:13:22.88 --> 00:13:24.88
knew it.

198
00:13:24.88 --> 00:13:33.12
You probably heard the shortened version of that speech in the movie Patton with George

199
00:13:33.12 --> 00:13:41.28
S. Scott, which is good, not as good as the original though, they actually sanitized the

200
00:13:41.28 --> 00:13:49.52
speech in the movie for Hollywood and for the American public, which is interesting.

201
00:13:49.52 --> 00:13:55.80
It's interesting that they sanitize what someone says in a war movie, even though the

202
00:13:55.80 --> 00:14:06.72
war movie is literally about killing people, lots of people, but General Patton, he knew

203
00:14:06.72 --> 00:14:13.40
and understood the power of language, especially bad language.

204
00:14:13.40 --> 00:14:21.84
His nephew asked his son, this is another thing I read that his nephew asked him about

205
00:14:21.84 --> 00:14:24.28
his use of profanity.

206
00:14:24.28 --> 00:14:29.44
And Patton said, when I want my men to remember something important to really make it

207
00:14:29.44 --> 00:14:34.04
stick, I give it to them double dirty.

208
00:14:34.04 --> 00:14:38.24
It may not sound nice to some bunch of little old ladies and afternoon tea party, but

209
00:14:38.24 --> 00:14:41.80
it helps my soldiers to remember.

210
00:14:41.80 --> 00:14:47.68
You can't run an army without profanity, and it has to be eloquent profanity.

211
00:14:47.68 --> 00:14:53.96
An army without profanity couldn't fight its way out of a piss-soaked paper bag.

212
00:14:53.96 --> 00:15:00.96
Just for the comments, I make sometimes I just buy God, get carried away with my own

213
00:15:00.96 --> 00:15:05.44
eloquence.

214
00:15:05.44 --> 00:15:08.84
So yeah, there's a time in place for profanity.

215
00:15:08.84 --> 00:15:17.28
I, when I was in the SEAL teams, I used to swear a lot, when making a point.

216
00:15:17.28 --> 00:15:21.44
And when making a point, obviously, you want to make it stick.

217
00:15:21.44 --> 00:15:22.44
This is something.

218
00:15:22.44 --> 00:15:23.44
Yeah.

219
00:15:23.44 --> 00:15:30.32
I think I've talked about this before, but I would bring my son out to training events.

220
00:15:30.32 --> 00:15:35.84
And I never swear in front of my family, even right now I don't swear in front of my family.

221
00:15:35.84 --> 00:15:42.64
So when my son was probably six years old, seven years old, and I'd bring him out to

222
00:15:42.64 --> 00:15:44.72
a training site to observe some training.

223
00:15:44.72 --> 00:15:51.32
So he could start getting some well-getting kind of anoculated to loud noises.

224
00:15:51.32 --> 00:15:56.12
Machine gunfire, teaching him this, the fundamentals of tactics and stuff.

225
00:15:56.12 --> 00:16:00.32
So when he'd come out and watch training, and then I would be debriefing.

226
00:16:00.32 --> 00:16:06.60
And you know, it would just be F-bomb, F-bomb sentence, half sentence, F-bomb, F-bomb.

227
00:16:06.60 --> 00:16:08.64
I remember the first time he saw me debrief like that.

228
00:16:08.64 --> 00:16:14.52
And it's also the first time he probably saw me, you know, I don't want to use the word

229
00:16:14.52 --> 00:16:18.48
emotional, but he's the first time he saw real intensity for me.

230
00:16:18.48 --> 00:16:20.88
Because you're trying to make a point to the guys.

231
00:16:20.88 --> 00:16:30.20
And I will freely say that at the time I would get really in the zone because I'm thinking

232
00:16:30.20 --> 00:16:34.64
that the guys that I'm training, I want them to absorb the message because I want them

233
00:16:34.64 --> 00:16:35.88
to go overseas and get killed.

234
00:16:35.88 --> 00:16:43.52
So, you know, there are some levels of intensity that would happen.

235
00:16:43.52 --> 00:16:50.20
So yeah, sometimes the language comes out and should have an impact.

236
00:16:50.20 --> 00:16:53.84
If you use it too much, obviously loses its impact.

237
00:16:53.84 --> 00:17:00.56
So like I said, we covered Patton's book, or as I knew it a long time ago.

238
00:17:00.56 --> 00:17:06.32
But there's Patton didn't just write that book.

239
00:17:06.32 --> 00:17:10.76
He actually was a fairly prolific writer.

240
00:17:10.76 --> 00:17:14.36
And some of what he wrote wasn't meant to be literature.

241
00:17:14.36 --> 00:17:19.80
It was things like general instructions to his troops.

242
00:17:19.80 --> 00:17:27.08
So I got some of those for us to look at just because they're, you know, they're good stuff.

243
00:17:27.08 --> 00:17:30.52
So this is one.

244
00:17:30.52 --> 00:17:33.000
There's two that we're going to go over today.

245
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.32
This is from headquarters, third United States Army.

246
00:17:38.32 --> 00:17:43.32
This March, 1944, subject letter of instruction, letter of instruction, number one,

247
00:17:43.32 --> 00:17:46.24
two core division and separate unit commanders.

248
00:17:46.24 --> 00:17:52.000
So this is one that's written to the commanders of the subordinate units underneath Patton.

249
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.64
Starts off with general.

250
00:17:54.64 --> 00:18:00.04
This letter will orient you officers of higher echelons in the principles of command, combat

251
00:18:00.04 --> 00:18:06.88
procedure, and administration which obtain in this army and will guide you in the conduct

252
00:18:06.88 --> 00:18:14.08
of your several commands, part number two, command, leadership, full duty.

253
00:18:14.08 --> 00:18:18.80
Each and his appropriate sphere will lead in person.

254
00:18:18.80 --> 00:18:23.84
Any commander who fails to obtain his objective and who is not dead or severely wounded

255
00:18:23.84 --> 00:18:25.80
has not done his full duty.

256
00:18:25.80 --> 00:18:29.44
That's by the way, just how he's kicking this thing off.

257
00:18:29.44 --> 00:18:32.000
And we've definitely talked about that one before.

258
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.80
But there you go, welcome to working for George Patton if you fail to obtain your objective

259
00:18:38.80 --> 00:18:42.80
and you're not dead or severely wounded.

260
00:18:42.80 --> 00:18:44.36
Then you haven't done your duty.

261
00:18:44.36 --> 00:18:49.44
So that's the basis on which we're building this stuff.

262
00:18:49.44 --> 00:18:52.88
Continues visits to the front.

263
00:18:52.88 --> 00:18:57.56
The commanding general or chief of staff never both at once and one member of each of the

264
00:18:57.56 --> 00:19:04.44
general staff sections should visit the front daily to save duplication.

265
00:19:04.44 --> 00:19:06.36
The chief of staff will designate the sector.

266
00:19:06.36 --> 00:19:07.68
Each is to visit.

267
00:19:07.68 --> 00:19:13.20
The function of these staff officers is to observe not to metal.

268
00:19:13.20 --> 00:19:14.20
Very important.

269
00:19:14.20 --> 00:19:17.64
Don't go up there and start trying to make little changes.

270
00:19:17.64 --> 00:19:19.64
No, you're up there to observe.

271
00:19:19.64 --> 00:19:23.84
Continuing, in addition to their own specialty, they must observe and report anything of military

272
00:19:23.84 --> 00:19:30.32
importance, remember to that your primary mission as a leader is to see with your own eyes

273
00:19:30.32 --> 00:19:35.24
and to be seen by the troops while engaged in personal reconnaissance.

274
00:19:35.24 --> 00:19:37.64
So think about that.

275
00:19:37.64 --> 00:19:42.16
Not just see what's going on, you want them to see you too.

276
00:19:42.16 --> 00:19:47.72
That you're out there with the troops.

277
00:19:47.72 --> 00:19:49.28
Next section is execution.

278
00:19:49.28 --> 00:19:55.20
In carrying out a mission, the promulgation of the order represents not over 10% of your

279
00:19:55.20 --> 00:19:58.20
responsibility.

280
00:19:58.20 --> 00:20:05.32
The remaining 90% consists of assuring by means of personal supervision on the ground by

281
00:20:05.32 --> 00:20:10.28
yourself and your staff proper and vigorous execution.

282
00:20:10.28 --> 00:20:13.36
How important is that?

283
00:20:13.36 --> 00:20:17.000
The passing of the order is 10% of your duties.

284
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.04
The other 90% is making sure it gets done.

285
00:20:21.04 --> 00:20:22.44
You don't hear that very often.

286
00:20:22.44 --> 00:20:24.44
I told them what to do.

287
00:20:24.44 --> 00:20:26.64
I passed the word, man.

288
00:20:26.64 --> 00:20:28.04
I passed the word.

289
00:20:28.04 --> 00:20:30.24
Not my problem.

290
00:20:30.24 --> 00:20:31.24
Wrong answer.

291
00:20:31.24 --> 00:20:34.92
That's actually, 90% of your problem.

292
00:20:34.92 --> 00:20:35.92
Go ahead.

293
00:20:35.92 --> 00:20:39.76
The one that I've maybe used, I don't know.

294
00:20:39.76 --> 00:20:40.76
Maybe heard, I don't know.

295
00:20:40.76 --> 00:20:43.12
It's like, hey, I can only say it so many times.

296
00:20:43.12 --> 00:20:44.12
I can't even feel it.

297
00:20:44.12 --> 00:20:45.12
Yeah, that's a good one.

298
00:20:45.12 --> 00:20:46.12
That's a good one.

299
00:20:46.12 --> 00:20:47.68
You know, I've told him a bunch of times.

300
00:20:47.68 --> 00:20:48.68
Yeah.

301
00:20:48.68 --> 00:20:51.68
I sent the email.

302
00:20:51.68 --> 00:20:52.68
I sent the email.

303
00:20:52.68 --> 00:20:57.20
No, 10% of your responsibility is passing the information.

304
00:20:57.20 --> 00:21:04.60
90% is assuring by means of personal supervision on the ground.

305
00:21:04.60 --> 00:21:07.44
Vigorous proper and vigorous execution.

306
00:21:07.44 --> 00:21:13.04
I think about that next time you put out the word and then you kick back into your chair.

307
00:21:13.04 --> 00:21:15.40
Wrong answer.

308
00:21:15.40 --> 00:21:18.60
Next year, staff conferences.

309
00:21:18.60 --> 00:21:19.84
I'm abbreviating this thing.

310
00:21:19.84 --> 00:21:23.96
Daily at the earliest possible moment that the G2 and G3 can get their maps posted.

311
00:21:23.96 --> 00:21:29.64
So G2 and G3, those are the, that's Intel and operations.

312
00:21:29.64 --> 00:21:33.44
As soon as they can get their maps posted, a staff conference will be held, attended by

313
00:21:33.44 --> 00:21:39.56
the Commanding General Chief of Staff and the heads of all general staff sections.

314
00:21:39.56 --> 00:21:40.92
And he goes through who those are.

315
00:21:40.92 --> 00:21:43.92
Then the reason I had this part, because I'm not reading this whole thing.

316
00:21:43.92 --> 00:21:53.92
But he says any person present when they statement to make will do so briefly.

317
00:21:53.92 --> 00:21:54.92
Check.

318
00:21:54.92 --> 00:21:55.92
Now then they're to talk.

319
00:21:55.92 --> 00:21:57.48
You're out in the under here yourself.

320
00:21:57.48 --> 00:22:01.32
You're not in there so that the Commanding General, the boss, the CEO, gets to see that

321
00:22:01.32 --> 00:22:03.28
you're in there and you said something smart.

322
00:22:03.28 --> 00:22:04.88
Actually, just be quiet.

323
00:22:04.88 --> 00:22:07.60
And if you have to say something, make it brief.

324
00:22:07.60 --> 00:22:08.60
It's supposed to be a brief.

325
00:22:08.60 --> 00:22:12.24
So that's called a brief.

326
00:22:12.24 --> 00:22:16.08
And just to mention that again, I'm not reading this entire thing, but we're eating some

327
00:22:16.08 --> 00:22:18.88
big chunks of it.

328
00:22:18.88 --> 00:22:22.24
Talks about rest periods.

329
00:22:22.24 --> 00:22:23.48
Rest periods.

330
00:22:23.48 --> 00:22:30.60
And we know there's big controversy from my world when it comes to rest.

331
00:22:30.60 --> 00:22:35.64
Because once a day, no, that's probably inaccurate.

332
00:22:35.64 --> 00:22:45.08
Probably between one and three times a day, someone via various social media messaging,

333
00:22:45.08 --> 00:22:53.52
whatever says to me, get more rest and sleep enough and all these things.

334
00:22:53.52 --> 00:23:03.56
Otherwise, my world is going to turn into a disaster, which wait and I'll not watch.

335
00:23:03.56 --> 00:23:05.92
So here's what the suit, but, and you know what I always say.

336
00:23:05.92 --> 00:23:09.68
Of course, it's in the book, discipline, it was freedom, field, minute.

337
00:23:09.68 --> 00:23:12.48
I wrote a book and said, you need to get sleep.

338
00:23:12.48 --> 00:23:13.60
Sleep is important without sleep.

339
00:23:13.60 --> 00:23:14.60
All these bad things happen.

340
00:23:14.60 --> 00:23:18.44
I know this and I propagated all the time.

341
00:23:18.44 --> 00:23:21.44
Sleep, you know, as soon as you were telling people not to sleep, no, actually, I tell

342
00:23:21.44 --> 00:23:22.60
people to sleep all the time.

343
00:23:22.60 --> 00:23:25.72
You need to sleep too, perform optimally, you need to sleep.

344
00:23:25.72 --> 00:23:27.16
Different people need different amounts of sleep.

345
00:23:27.16 --> 00:23:29.32
Have them at sleep, you need to get it.

346
00:23:29.32 --> 00:23:30.32
It's fine.

347
00:23:30.32 --> 00:23:31.32
It's great.

348
00:23:31.32 --> 00:23:32.32
I support it.

349
00:23:32.32 --> 00:23:33.84
Here we go, rest periods.

350
00:23:33.84 --> 00:23:38.72
Staff personnel, commissionant and listed who do not rest, do not last.

351
00:23:38.72 --> 00:23:43.28
All sections must run a duty roster and enforce compliance.

352
00:23:43.28 --> 00:23:47.32
The intensity of staff operations during battle is periodic at the Army and Corps levels

353
00:23:47.32 --> 00:23:52.32
the busiest times of the period from one to three hours after daylight and from three to

354
00:23:52.32 --> 00:23:53.76
five hours after dark.

355
00:23:53.76 --> 00:24:00.16
In the lower echelons and in the administrative and supply staffs, the time periods is different,

356
00:24:00.16 --> 00:24:02.28
but just as definite.

357
00:24:02.28 --> 00:24:08.48
When the need arises, everyone, when the need arises, everyone must work all the time, but

358
00:24:08.48 --> 00:24:11.16
these emergencies are not frequent.

359
00:24:11.16 --> 00:24:15.40
Unfutigged men, fast-bonger and work better at high pressure.

360
00:24:15.40 --> 00:24:20.44
So like I say, like I tell people all the time, get sleep.

361
00:24:20.44 --> 00:24:21.72
Not bad for you.

362
00:24:21.72 --> 00:24:23.92
Do you need to sleep until mine?

363
00:24:23.92 --> 00:24:25.32
No, you don't.

364
00:24:25.32 --> 00:24:27.12
Well, some people do.

365
00:24:27.12 --> 00:24:28.12
Depends when you go.

366
00:24:28.12 --> 00:24:30.72
I didn't receive a return text from you today.

367
00:24:30.72 --> 00:24:33.80
Until I'm thinking it was around 10.

368
00:24:33.80 --> 00:24:34.80
Do you?

369
00:24:34.80 --> 00:24:35.80
Am I right or wrong?

370
00:24:35.80 --> 00:24:37.04
Well, you know, you probably right.

371
00:24:37.04 --> 00:24:38.76
I don't have those records.

372
00:24:38.76 --> 00:24:39.76
We can check.

373
00:24:39.76 --> 00:24:41.32
So is that what time you woke up?

374
00:24:41.32 --> 00:24:43.32
Just out of curiosity.

375
00:24:43.32 --> 00:24:44.32
Yes.

376
00:24:44.32 --> 00:24:45.32
Do you feel well rested right now?

377
00:24:45.32 --> 00:24:46.32
Ready to perform.

378
00:24:46.32 --> 00:24:47.32
Yes.

379
00:24:47.32 --> 00:24:48.32
Ready to bring your egg in.

380
00:24:48.32 --> 00:24:49.32
Yes, sir.

381
00:24:49.32 --> 00:24:50.32
It's a long story.

382
00:24:50.32 --> 00:24:51.32
It's worth it.

383
00:24:51.32 --> 00:24:53.68
We up late last night watching the fights.

384
00:24:53.68 --> 00:24:54.68
No.

385
00:24:54.68 --> 00:24:55.68
Conorczestique was super early.

386
00:24:55.68 --> 00:24:57.68
Conorczestique was only 40 seconds long.

387
00:24:57.68 --> 00:24:58.68
Yeah.

388
00:24:58.68 --> 00:25:00.32
I could have been in bed at.

389
00:25:00.32 --> 00:25:02.32
We're talking nine.

390
00:25:02.32 --> 00:25:04.32
I was.

391
00:25:04.32 --> 00:25:08.68
I was going to bed and I just like literally going to bed when I

392
00:25:08.68 --> 00:25:10.32
seen the results come through.

393
00:25:10.32 --> 00:25:11.32
Okay.

394
00:25:11.32 --> 00:25:12.92
But I'm not used to going to sleep that early.

395
00:25:12.92 --> 00:25:15.000
So I ended up waking up in the middle of the night, not

396
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.12
being able to go back sleep.

397
00:25:16.12 --> 00:25:18.68
And then you hit the rest of it.

398
00:25:18.68 --> 00:25:19.68
Yeah.

399
00:25:19.68 --> 00:25:20.68
Walk up it.

400
00:25:20.68 --> 00:25:21.68
Okay.

401
00:25:21.68 --> 00:25:23.08
So rest is important.

402
00:25:23.08 --> 00:25:24.08
There you go.

403
00:25:24.08 --> 00:25:28.96
It's an order from Paton that you need to get rest.

404
00:25:28.96 --> 00:25:34.12
Next section is location of command posts.

405
00:25:34.12 --> 00:25:37.44
The farther forward, the command post are located.

406
00:25:37.44 --> 00:25:40.24
The last time is wasted in driving to and from the front.

407
00:25:40.24 --> 00:25:44.16
The ideal situation would be for the army command post to be within one, half hour

408
00:25:44.16 --> 00:25:49.16
drive in a command post in reconnaissance car of the division command post.

409
00:25:49.16 --> 00:25:52.76
The driving time to the front and from the command post, the driving time to the front

410
00:25:52.76 --> 00:25:56.84
from the command post of the lower units should be correspondingly shorter.

411
00:25:56.84 --> 00:26:02.48
Much time and wire saved if command posts of higher units are at or near one of the command

412
00:26:02.48 --> 00:26:04.28
posts of the next level of the national.

413
00:26:04.28 --> 00:26:06.88
So why am I talking about that?

414
00:26:06.88 --> 00:26:16.24
Because the reason is think about how important communication is between the senior leadership

415
00:26:16.24 --> 00:26:17.60
and the front line troops.

416
00:26:17.60 --> 00:26:21.28
And when you have big separation, now what's nice these days, then he goes into a bunch

417
00:26:21.28 --> 00:26:24.24
of stuff talking about when he's talking about wire versus radio.

418
00:26:24.24 --> 00:26:27.68
Because you know what that means, they used to actually string out wire.

419
00:26:27.68 --> 00:26:33.80
So if you had a forward post to miles from me, we would string wire between the two of

420
00:26:33.80 --> 00:26:34.80
us so we could talk.

421
00:26:34.80 --> 00:26:38.40
Like phone wire, like little phone wire.

422
00:26:38.40 --> 00:26:41.56
And in that opening speech when he's talking about a guy in Tunisia, putting wire up

423
00:26:41.56 --> 00:26:43.64
on a telephone, that's what he's talking about.

424
00:26:43.64 --> 00:26:50.16
Because radios at that time were way less reliable than they are now.

425
00:26:50.16 --> 00:26:57.16
So now we can overcome a lot of this with technology, but just showing the importance of,

426
00:26:57.16 --> 00:27:00.12
and by the way, he's not even talking about wire.

427
00:27:00.12 --> 00:27:03.72
He's talking about being able to go there and see what's happening.

428
00:27:03.72 --> 00:27:05.88
So there's ways to overcome this.

429
00:27:05.88 --> 00:27:12.80
I guess my point in calling this out is showing how important visible leadership is, right?

430
00:27:12.80 --> 00:27:20.08
How important face to face is from a leadership perspective.

431
00:27:20.08 --> 00:27:22.24
How map procedure, next section, maps.

432
00:27:22.24 --> 00:27:27.48
We are too prone to believe that we acquire merit solely through the study of maps in

433
00:27:27.48 --> 00:27:30.32
the safe conclusion of a command post.

434
00:27:30.32 --> 00:27:34.000
Maps are necessary in order to see the whole panoramic of battle and to permit intelligent

435
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
planning.

436
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.16
Further, and this is very important, a study of the map will indicate where critical situations

437
00:27:41.16 --> 00:27:47.24
exist or are apt to develop and so indicate where the commander should be.

438
00:27:47.24 --> 00:27:53.000
And the high-rashalons, a layered map of the whole theater is reasonable to scale, showing

439
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.60
roads, railway streams, towns, more useful than a large scale map, cluttered up with

440
00:27:56.60 --> 00:27:57.60
the ground force.

441
00:27:57.60 --> 00:28:12.84
So the reason that I put this in here is looking visibly, visually at something real.

442
00:28:12.84 --> 00:28:19.48
This is a little bit of a, just an eye opener, right?

443
00:28:19.48 --> 00:28:22.92
You have virtually, everything's virtual now, right?

444
00:28:22.92 --> 00:28:27.12
We can look at virtual charts, we can see virtual diagrams, we can see virtual spreadsheets,

445
00:28:27.12 --> 00:28:31.52
we can see market data, and I get it.

446
00:28:31.52 --> 00:28:42.04
And there's many, much of the time, virtual data has superior, some superior qualities of it,

447
00:28:42.04 --> 00:28:45.76
as you can manipulate it, you can watch it move, you can dig into it, you can click on the

448
00:28:45.76 --> 00:28:47.12
link, right?

449
00:28:47.12 --> 00:28:51.76
And see where the source of the data is, and all that stuff is good.

450
00:28:51.76 --> 00:29:00.20
All I'm saying, and the only reason I bring this up is because sometimes the physical

451
00:29:00.20 --> 00:29:05.000
map, the physical chart, the physical spreadsheet that you can look at that you can put

452
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.04
up on a wall and say, let's talk through this.

453
00:29:09.04 --> 00:29:14.88
Sometimes, and part of this, I think, is just my personality, my, the way that I, you know,

454
00:29:14.88 --> 00:29:18.28
people have different types of learning, right?

455
00:29:18.28 --> 00:29:25.56
My, the way my brain works, sometimes to look at something that's actually physically

456
00:29:25.56 --> 00:29:34.24
there, sometimes works better for me than the virtual thing that I'm looking out on a screen.

457
00:29:34.24 --> 00:29:35.60
Just throwing that out there makes sense.

458
00:29:35.60 --> 00:29:39.12
I don't know if you feel that way.

459
00:29:39.12 --> 00:29:43.36
Well, I feel like if, you know, when you're talking about a map or even like a diagram,

460
00:29:43.36 --> 00:29:48.96
if I have it physically in front of me and then, and you, and then you're physically in

461
00:29:48.96 --> 00:29:50.32
front of me.

462
00:29:50.32 --> 00:29:51.32
So we're both physically there.

463
00:29:51.32 --> 00:29:54.92
We can kind of interact with it in the physical world, so I can point here and maybe

464
00:29:54.92 --> 00:29:55.92
have been marketed with the pencil.

465
00:29:55.92 --> 00:29:57.92
Which you can get, which you can get, that's what I'm saying.

466
00:29:57.92 --> 00:30:01.08
Like nowadays, you can have an iPad, right?

467
00:30:01.08 --> 00:30:02.52
And we could be marking that things up.

468
00:30:02.52 --> 00:30:06.44
So there's, there's some closure that gap is getting closed on this.

469
00:30:06.44 --> 00:30:12.20
Yeah, the iPad's, it's close, but not really, because iPad's only this big.

470
00:30:12.20 --> 00:30:13.20
True.

471
00:30:13.20 --> 00:30:18.16
And it's like when you write on it, there's that, what you call, like a barrier, like,

472
00:30:18.16 --> 00:30:22.84
at very least psychological barrier between the actual document.

473
00:30:22.84 --> 00:30:27.04
You know, and, and us, it feels like it, right?

474
00:30:27.04 --> 00:30:28.04
Yeah.

475
00:30:28.04 --> 00:30:30.60
Even though you're marking on, you know, it's a touchscreen.

476
00:30:30.60 --> 00:30:35.000
It feels like, here's one that this is a real simple straightforward one.

477
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:42.48
The difference between a physical checklist on a piece of paper or on a whiteboard, compared

478
00:30:42.48 --> 00:30:49.12
to, there's about five million apps, including native apps to your phone that do

479
00:30:49.12 --> 00:30:51.000
checklists.

480
00:30:51.000 --> 00:31:00.08
I personally think that I find physical lists in a notebook or on a whiteboard.

481
00:31:00.08 --> 00:31:01.08
Yeah, better.

482
00:31:01.08 --> 00:31:02.08
What do you think?

483
00:31:02.08 --> 00:31:06.36
I think it's funny how you use the expression native apps.

484
00:31:06.36 --> 00:31:07.36
Was that correct?

485
00:31:07.36 --> 00:31:08.36
It's advanced.

486
00:31:08.36 --> 00:31:09.36
Yes, yes.

487
00:31:09.36 --> 00:31:10.36
That's what they are, right?

488
00:31:10.36 --> 00:31:11.36
Like Apple has comes with it.

489
00:31:11.36 --> 00:31:12.36
Yeah, it comes with it.

490
00:31:12.36 --> 00:31:13.36
Yeah, it's good.

491
00:31:13.36 --> 00:31:14.36
Yeah, it comes with it.

492
00:31:14.36 --> 00:31:15.36
Yeah, it comes with it.

493
00:31:15.36 --> 00:31:16.36
Yeah, yeah.

494
00:31:16.36 --> 00:31:17.36
Oh, yeah.

495
00:31:17.36 --> 00:31:18.36
I could dig it.

496
00:31:18.36 --> 00:31:19.36
They should contact me.

497
00:31:19.36 --> 00:31:20.36
Actually.

498
00:31:20.36 --> 00:31:21.36
Sure.

499
00:31:21.36 --> 00:31:22.36
Of course, they should.

500
00:31:22.36 --> 00:31:23.36
They should.

501
00:31:23.36 --> 00:31:27.40
And I could dial that app where it would be squared away.

502
00:31:27.40 --> 00:31:28.40
Very tactile.

503
00:31:28.40 --> 00:31:29.40
Right.

504
00:31:29.40 --> 00:31:36.04
Yeah, but also the one of the problems is one of the disadvantages of those kind

505
00:31:36.04 --> 00:31:40.64
of lists is because things are hidden, right?

506
00:31:40.64 --> 00:31:42.44
Like you have to open that list, right?

507
00:31:42.44 --> 00:31:43.76
So you can't see it.

508
00:31:43.76 --> 00:31:46.92
So you look at a project and you don't even see the depth of the project.

509
00:31:46.92 --> 00:31:49.48
Whereas if you have like a physical list that you're looking at, you say, oh, that

510
00:31:49.48 --> 00:31:52.44
project is going to take some labor.

511
00:31:52.44 --> 00:31:54.88
Yeah, I feel it for sure.

512
00:31:54.88 --> 00:31:59.08
I think I'm kind of used to the apps though, as far as like notes and whatever.

513
00:31:59.08 --> 00:32:00.08
You still it.

514
00:32:00.08 --> 00:32:02.68
So I think like anything, the more you get, you still it, the more you're like, oh, I like

515
00:32:02.68 --> 00:32:03.68
this or whatever.

516
00:32:03.68 --> 00:32:07.88
I used the notes one.

517
00:32:07.88 --> 00:32:09.16
So easy.

518
00:32:09.16 --> 00:32:15.88
Like when in the seal teams, PowerPoint just started to just run everything.

519
00:32:15.88 --> 00:32:18.08
Everything was briefed on PowerPoint.

520
00:32:18.08 --> 00:32:21.96
And that is one time when you would look, when you'd bring the guys around to look

521
00:32:21.96 --> 00:32:27.40
at a map or bring the guys around to look at an image, that's all that you're can draw

522
00:32:27.40 --> 00:32:28.64
on.

523
00:32:28.64 --> 00:32:31.80
No much clearer than just everyone sitting there.

524
00:32:31.80 --> 00:32:33.52
There's the separation, I guess you called it.

525
00:32:33.52 --> 00:32:36.24
What you call it a virtual separation, there's some separation.

526
00:32:36.24 --> 00:32:37.24
There's a barrier.

527
00:32:37.24 --> 00:32:42.72
When you'd actually pull out a map and say, here's the route, you'd be like drawing

528
00:32:42.72 --> 00:32:43.72
on there.

529
00:32:43.72 --> 00:32:45.52
And you'd say, okay, there's a hill over here.

530
00:32:45.52 --> 00:32:48.48
And people, I don't know, people seem to get it better.

531
00:32:48.48 --> 00:32:53.28
Same thing with something called a forced list.

532
00:32:53.28 --> 00:32:54.28
Which sounds really cool.

533
00:32:54.28 --> 00:32:57.12
But all it means is this is who's going on this mission.

534
00:32:57.12 --> 00:33:00.16
And also where they're sitting in the vehicles.

535
00:33:00.16 --> 00:33:03.56
The virtual forced list almost always sucked.

536
00:33:03.56 --> 00:33:05.76
It was almost always like slightly wrong.

537
00:33:05.76 --> 00:33:09.88
And people wouldn't know where that, but we would do it on a magnet board.

538
00:33:09.88 --> 00:33:11.44
And everybody had their own magnet.

539
00:33:11.44 --> 00:33:14.16
I still have my magnet for my first deployment.

540
00:33:14.16 --> 00:33:18.12
It says, my magnet says, just as Jocco, it's yellow.

541
00:33:18.12 --> 00:33:19.56
Well, it's the magnets brown.

542
00:33:19.56 --> 00:33:21.44
And then it says, Jocco in its off center.

543
00:33:21.44 --> 00:33:23.56
It looks like somebody did it in five minutes.

544
00:33:23.56 --> 00:33:27.08
Not like this big high speed thing.

545
00:33:27.08 --> 00:33:31.000
No, it says really kind of rudimentary magnets.

546
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:31.84
It says Jocco.

547
00:33:31.84 --> 00:33:34.52
So when you get your magnet, that's just, that's your magnet.

548
00:33:34.52 --> 00:33:36.04
That's for the whole trip.

549
00:33:36.04 --> 00:33:38.12
I'm making it into a bigger deal than it is.

550
00:33:38.12 --> 00:33:39.12
I'm gonna see you pretty dope.

551
00:33:39.12 --> 00:33:42.80
But on that first deployment to Iraq, that was my magnet.

552
00:33:42.80 --> 00:33:45.16
When I left, I took the magnet with me.

553
00:33:45.16 --> 00:33:47.60
Because there's some good memories with the magnet, right?

554
00:33:47.60 --> 00:33:51.88
See that thing in the, because you have on the, on the dry erase board,

555
00:33:51.88 --> 00:33:55.84
the magnetic dry erase board, you have outlines of the vehicles.

556
00:33:55.84 --> 00:33:59.08
And then you just put your magnet gets put in the position.

557
00:33:59.08 --> 00:33:59.76
You look at the board.

558
00:33:59.76 --> 00:34:00.88
You know where you're at, right?

559
00:34:00.88 --> 00:34:01.72
Yeah.

560
00:34:01.72 --> 00:34:06.60
And most of the time, you know I was in vehicle two in the vehicle commander seat.

561
00:34:06.60 --> 00:34:09.84
That's where I was most of the time, depending on what we were doing.

562
00:34:09.84 --> 00:34:12.20
Sometimes I would be, if I was like the assault force commander,

563
00:34:12.20 --> 00:34:14.60
I might be in vehicle three, but whatever.

564
00:34:14.60 --> 00:34:16.32
But that little magnet.

565
00:34:16.32 --> 00:34:17.92
You know where it is right now?

566
00:34:17.92 --> 00:34:18.76
On your refrigerator.

567
00:34:18.76 --> 00:34:19.60
Yes, it is.

568
00:34:19.60 --> 00:34:21.04
So when I look, go to the fridge, right?

569
00:34:21.04 --> 00:34:23.32
I remember that magnet.

570
00:34:23.32 --> 00:34:28.56
And one of my buddies named Johnny, like one day he sent me a picture of his magnet.

571
00:34:28.56 --> 00:34:29.56
Sure.

572
00:34:29.56 --> 00:34:31.24
And I said in the picture of my back.

573
00:34:31.24 --> 00:34:31.88
Yeah.

574
00:34:31.88 --> 00:34:34.08
Wait, what could so, okay, so you're in the magnet.

575
00:34:34.08 --> 00:34:35.08
It's just a circle.

576
00:34:35.08 --> 00:34:36.08
No, it's not a circle.

577
00:34:36.08 --> 00:34:37.08
It's a square.

578
00:34:37.08 --> 00:34:38.08
It's a rectangle.

579
00:34:38.08 --> 00:34:40.36
But is it like just a raw magnet though?

580
00:34:40.36 --> 00:34:41.36
Or is it raw magnet?

581
00:34:41.36 --> 00:34:44.08
A raw magnet with a, with what's it called?

582
00:34:44.08 --> 00:34:47.04
You ever seen those little machines where you make a label?

583
00:34:47.04 --> 00:34:48.04
A label.

584
00:34:48.04 --> 00:34:49.04
A label maker.

585
00:34:49.04 --> 00:34:52.44
So there's a little yellow label.

586
00:34:52.44 --> 00:34:55.04
And the magnet just says, jockel.

587
00:34:55.04 --> 00:34:56.48
Boom, there it is.

588
00:34:56.48 --> 00:34:57.48
And it's off center.

589
00:34:57.48 --> 00:34:59.20
That's what makes me, that's what's corresponding.

590
00:34:59.20 --> 00:35:00.60
It's not like this special thing.

591
00:35:00.60 --> 00:35:02.48
I'll say, okay, here.

592
00:35:02.48 --> 00:35:03.48
Boom, done.

593
00:35:03.48 --> 00:35:06.16
Yeah, but it's like one of the, for lack of a bit of terms.

594
00:35:06.16 --> 00:35:10.56
I remember for lack of a, one of the trinkets of the missions, you know, it's like

595
00:35:10.56 --> 00:35:13.76
one of the memorabilia or whatever.

596
00:35:13.76 --> 00:35:17.08
It might be, I don't know, I'd have to think of.

597
00:35:17.08 --> 00:35:18.32
I'm sure there's other trinkets.

598
00:35:18.32 --> 00:35:20.64
But that is the one thing that I got.

599
00:35:20.64 --> 00:35:21.64
Oh, yeah.

600
00:35:21.64 --> 00:35:22.64
Yeah, I'm right there.

601
00:35:22.64 --> 00:35:24.40
Everyone's so I get those kind.

602
00:35:24.40 --> 00:35:25.88
Something that's of use.

603
00:35:25.88 --> 00:35:29.24
Not major massive use, but it's like an essential part of the whole.

604
00:35:29.24 --> 00:35:33.44
When we made Tasking to Bruiser, the first thing I was, okay, guys, we need magnets.

605
00:35:33.44 --> 00:35:36.60
And you know, everyone's like thinking, uh, whatever.

606
00:35:36.60 --> 00:35:39.24
We'll just use the computer and all that stuff.

607
00:35:39.24 --> 00:35:41.48
And it's so much harder.

608
00:35:41.48 --> 00:35:45.48
Imagine this, you've got 40 people, 40 little names.

609
00:35:45.48 --> 00:35:47.56
And you're dragging them around on PowerPoint.

610
00:35:47.56 --> 00:35:49.92
And so what, you deleted one by accident, where did that one go?

611
00:35:49.92 --> 00:35:50.92
It's from a different.

612
00:35:50.92 --> 00:35:53.52
And magnets, like you have a space on the magnet board.

613
00:35:53.52 --> 00:35:54.92
Oh, these guys aren't going on the mission.

614
00:35:54.92 --> 00:35:56.60
They're over here.

615
00:35:56.60 --> 00:35:57.60
But you can see them.

616
00:35:57.60 --> 00:35:59.60
And then you say, wait, we need another machine gun or, oh, cool.

617
00:35:59.60 --> 00:36:00.60
Who's the machine gunner?

618
00:36:00.60 --> 00:36:01.60
Smith's the machine gunner.

619
00:36:01.60 --> 00:36:02.60
Pull it in the turret.

620
00:36:02.60 --> 00:36:03.60
Boom, we're good.

621
00:36:03.60 --> 00:36:04.60
Yeah.

622
00:36:04.60 --> 00:36:07.24
The physical representation is important.

623
00:36:07.24 --> 00:36:08.24
Yep.

624
00:36:08.24 --> 00:36:09.24
Yeah, I know what it is.

625
00:36:09.24 --> 00:36:10.24
I know what it is.

626
00:36:10.24 --> 00:36:11.24
Okay.

627
00:36:11.24 --> 00:36:12.24
Okay.

628
00:36:12.24 --> 00:36:15.24
So I, can you know, Photoshop is?

629
00:36:15.24 --> 00:36:16.24
I do know what it is.

630
00:36:16.24 --> 00:36:17.84
It's not a native app though.

631
00:36:17.84 --> 00:36:18.84
No, sir.

632
00:36:18.84 --> 00:36:21.84
So that's after market one for sure.

633
00:36:21.84 --> 00:36:22.84
So the, okay.

634
00:36:22.84 --> 00:36:28.08
So Photoshop is like, really when you get used to it, it's like, oh, it's simple.

635
00:36:28.08 --> 00:36:29.28
But here's the difference.

636
00:36:29.28 --> 00:36:30.92
And I just distilled it down.

637
00:36:30.92 --> 00:36:32.72
It's the interface.

638
00:36:32.72 --> 00:36:33.72
The interface.

639
00:36:33.72 --> 00:36:36.12
That's what makes it like, that's the barrier.

640
00:36:36.12 --> 00:36:39.28
Even if it's a simple interface, like PowerPoint, you know, they're still in interface.

641
00:36:39.28 --> 00:36:41.60
You got to learn how to use PowerPoint, right?

642
00:36:41.60 --> 00:36:46.32
So even after you learn how to use PowerPoint, you still have to interface with the system.

643
00:36:46.32 --> 00:36:47.32
You do.

644
00:36:47.32 --> 00:36:49.32
But with a physical thing, there is no interface.

645
00:36:49.32 --> 00:36:51.000
There's just boom, boom, we're doing it.

646
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.60
You look, if I want this little jockey magnet to physically move to the front seat, watch

647
00:36:55.60 --> 00:36:57.000
me physically move to the front seat.

648
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
There's no interface that happens.

649
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Exactly.

650
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
It's really how it is.

651
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Yeah.

652
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.60
So the feedback is instant.

653
00:37:02.60 --> 00:37:03.60
Yeah.

654
00:37:03.60 --> 00:37:04.76
Big as kind of a big deal.

655
00:37:04.76 --> 00:37:10.08
I remember, I, well, I have to reconfirm this with life.

656
00:37:10.08 --> 00:37:13.32
But there was, I wouldn't say resistance.

657
00:37:13.32 --> 00:37:15.32
But questions.

658
00:37:15.32 --> 00:37:19.24
You know, because I think I went out and just bought magnets for task in the bruiser.

659
00:37:19.24 --> 00:37:20.24
Like, okay, here's the magnet.

660
00:37:20.24 --> 00:37:21.24
Here's the magnet.

661
00:37:21.24 --> 00:37:22.88
The magnet boards were expensive, too.

662
00:37:22.88 --> 00:37:26.72
I want to say they were, I want to say a big magnet board costs over $100.

663
00:37:26.72 --> 00:37:27.72
Yeah.

664
00:37:27.72 --> 00:37:32.76
Where's a lot of money when you're in the Navy and you got three kids, like, 100 bucks

665
00:37:32.76 --> 00:37:33.76
is no joke.

666
00:37:33.76 --> 00:37:34.76
Oh, yeah.

667
00:37:34.76 --> 00:37:35.76
For just some board.

668
00:37:35.76 --> 00:37:36.76
Yeah.

669
00:37:36.76 --> 00:37:38.36
But well, worth every penny.

670
00:37:38.36 --> 00:37:39.36
Yeah.

671
00:37:39.36 --> 00:37:40.36
Every penny.

672
00:37:40.36 --> 00:37:43.52
So do you, because you like to refysical books, too?

673
00:37:43.52 --> 00:37:44.52
I do.

674
00:37:44.52 --> 00:37:48.28
And I'm not saying necessarily compared to audible, but like I used the Kindle.

675
00:37:48.28 --> 00:37:49.28
Right?

676
00:37:49.28 --> 00:37:51.44
There's little interface going on right there, too.

677
00:37:51.44 --> 00:37:53.88
But technically, it's quicker.

678
00:37:53.88 --> 00:37:58.48
There's less physical work to use the Kindle than a book.

679
00:37:58.48 --> 00:37:59.48
Yeah.

680
00:37:59.48 --> 00:38:06.08
I think what would happen to happen for me is I would have to use a Kindle or whatever digital

681
00:38:06.08 --> 00:38:08.84
reader thing until I learn the interface.

682
00:38:08.84 --> 00:38:12.04
Because right now, I can't stand those things.

683
00:38:12.04 --> 00:38:13.04
Yeah.

684
00:38:13.04 --> 00:38:16.36
Well, in the Kindle app or whatever, but yeah, yeah, it's the same thing.

685
00:38:16.36 --> 00:38:18.60
Kindle actually, I think the actual Kindle is bigger.

686
00:38:18.60 --> 00:38:23.84
You know what's interesting about my kids do for a school and whatnot.

687
00:38:23.84 --> 00:38:28.36
They read the book as they listen to the audio book, which is kind of interesting.

688
00:38:28.36 --> 00:38:29.36
Yeah.

689
00:38:29.36 --> 00:38:30.36
You know what?

690
00:38:30.36 --> 00:38:31.36
I did that one time.

691
00:38:31.36 --> 00:38:33.20
You know what book I did it for?

692
00:38:33.20 --> 00:38:35.76
Field's a fire by James Webb.

693
00:38:35.76 --> 00:38:38.80
I was listening to it and reading it.

694
00:38:38.80 --> 00:38:39.80
And I don't know why.

695
00:38:39.80 --> 00:38:43.000
I don't know why I decided to do that.

696
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.04
Maybe because it was a fiction book.

697
00:38:45.04 --> 00:38:46.04
I don't know.

698
00:38:46.04 --> 00:38:48.48
But for some reason, that's what I did.

699
00:38:48.48 --> 00:38:50.72
Well, there's all kinds of like different reading methods.

700
00:38:50.72 --> 00:38:54.48
You know, this is all these methods like to read, whether it be faster, improve comprehension,

701
00:38:54.48 --> 00:38:55.48
you know, this way.

702
00:38:55.48 --> 00:39:00.40
And one of them is to skim, like rudimentary skim.

703
00:39:00.40 --> 00:39:03.72
But kind of like literally like three seconds per page.

704
00:39:03.72 --> 00:39:05.32
Maybe even one second per page.

705
00:39:05.32 --> 00:39:06.32
Okay.

706
00:39:06.32 --> 00:39:07.32
What is that?

707
00:39:07.32 --> 00:39:08.32
The game null thing first.

708
00:39:08.32 --> 00:39:11.32
And it creates this idea of whatever things about.

709
00:39:11.32 --> 00:39:13.68
So you skim at first and then you're going to go back to your idea.

710
00:39:13.68 --> 00:39:14.68
Okay.

711
00:39:14.68 --> 00:39:17.24
I was going to really throw that idea out the window.

712
00:39:17.24 --> 00:39:19.24
Just came in and then you leave the window.

713
00:39:19.24 --> 00:39:20.24
Yeah.

714
00:39:20.24 --> 00:39:24.20
Actually, so when I get a book, a potential book for the podcast, I will say I do some

715
00:39:24.20 --> 00:39:25.20
of that.

716
00:39:25.20 --> 00:39:28.92
I'll be looking through it because you know, the book for the podcast is going to have

717
00:39:28.92 --> 00:39:29.92
to be a good book.

718
00:39:29.92 --> 00:39:30.92
Right.

719
00:39:30.92 --> 00:39:34.56
And I got to make sure that fits in with the podcast.

720
00:39:34.56 --> 00:39:35.56
Right.

721
00:39:35.56 --> 00:39:37.40
So I'll skim it and look for scenes.

722
00:39:37.40 --> 00:39:38.40
Yeah.

723
00:39:38.40 --> 00:39:39.40
That I go.

724
00:39:39.40 --> 00:39:40.40
Oh, that's a good one.

725
00:39:40.40 --> 00:39:42.24
What I do is I read the end.

726
00:39:42.24 --> 00:39:44.20
As jacked up as that is spoiler alert.

727
00:39:44.20 --> 00:39:46.28
I spoil the book for myself.

728
00:39:46.28 --> 00:39:48.08
Even though most of the time, you kind of know what's going to happen.

729
00:39:48.08 --> 00:39:49.08
I mean, it's a war book.

730
00:39:49.08 --> 00:39:50.48
It's like, oh, it's a world war, too.

731
00:39:50.48 --> 00:39:51.48
Cool.

732
00:39:51.48 --> 00:39:52.48
We know what's going to happen.

733
00:39:52.48 --> 00:39:53.48
Right.

734
00:39:53.48 --> 00:39:55.24
If the first person person that's writing it, they live to write the book.

735
00:39:55.24 --> 00:39:56.48
So you know they're alive.

736
00:39:56.48 --> 00:39:57.48
Right.

737
00:39:57.48 --> 00:40:00.92
Most of the time, there's been a few where the person, you know, this is recovered from

738
00:40:00.92 --> 00:40:02.56
them or whatever.

739
00:40:02.56 --> 00:40:03.56
But yeah.

740
00:40:03.56 --> 00:40:06.000
So I skim through them and then I find the information.

741
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:14.16
But I can't, I haven't been able to prep for a podcast virtually yet.

742
00:40:14.16 --> 00:40:17.76
All of them have been even though it's one where I was traveling and I decided I was going

743
00:40:17.76 --> 00:40:22.68
to do something that I had it on PDF and I went through the whole thing and like I outlined

744
00:40:22.68 --> 00:40:25.24
it and stuff while virtually.

745
00:40:25.24 --> 00:40:27.56
And then when I got home, I printed it and I brought it in.

746
00:40:27.56 --> 00:40:28.56
Yeah.

747
00:40:28.56 --> 00:40:29.56
Yeah.

748
00:40:29.56 --> 00:40:34.20
There must be something with the like the relationship between, you know, the material,

749
00:40:34.20 --> 00:40:37.32
the physical material in your eyeballs or something.

750
00:40:37.32 --> 00:40:39.84
So let's just say this from a leadership perspective.

751
00:40:39.84 --> 00:40:42.36
Here's the take away.

752
00:40:42.36 --> 00:40:50.52
If the virtual methodology is not working, perhaps try a physical version.

753
00:40:50.52 --> 00:40:55.52
That's going to be my suggestion after all this, all throughout this assessment of general

754
00:40:55.52 --> 00:40:57.72
patterns, it words.

755
00:40:57.72 --> 00:40:58.72
Check.

756
00:40:58.72 --> 00:41:00.92
All right.

757
00:41:00.92 --> 00:41:06.000
Now we get to plans and what's cool about this, his plans, his sections, like the last

758
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
sections of a couple paragraphs along the section before that couple paragraphs along.

759
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.40
The section about planning arguably the most important section to be given by the commander

760
00:41:15.40 --> 00:41:16.64
of how we're going to plan.

761
00:41:16.64 --> 00:41:20.64
This is that one of the shortest sections here plans.

762
00:41:20.64 --> 00:41:24.28
Plans must be simple and flexible.

763
00:41:24.28 --> 00:41:31.60
I got that, I utilized that right there so much.

764
00:41:31.60 --> 00:41:37.000
It was ridiculous and it was so powerful to be able to say, hey, look, because in the

765
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.80
sealed teams, they would lean towards wanting and not just in sealed teams.

766
00:41:39.80 --> 00:41:41.44
They people do this in business all the time.

767
00:41:41.44 --> 00:41:46.60
They want to make, they want to make plans ultra detailed because they think the more

768
00:41:46.60 --> 00:41:50.04
detail the plan, the better the plan will be executed.

769
00:41:50.04 --> 00:41:51.68
That's actually wrong.

770
00:41:51.68 --> 00:41:54.08
The more detail you put in the, look, you need to have some level of

771
00:41:54.08 --> 00:41:57.36
detail, but if you go overboard with the detail, now you're working on things that don't

772
00:41:57.36 --> 00:41:58.36
matter.

773
00:41:58.36 --> 00:42:00.24
You're trying to do things in a way that don't matter.

774
00:42:00.24 --> 00:42:01.64
You can't do that.

775
00:42:01.64 --> 00:42:06.56
So that's how we start to have plans must be simple and flexible.

776
00:42:06.56 --> 00:42:09.000
Because nothing's going to go the way you expected to go.

777
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Then he says this, actually they only form a datum plane from which you build as necessity

778
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.32
directs or opportunity offers.

779
00:42:19.32 --> 00:42:22.12
The plan is actually, is barely anything.

780
00:42:22.12 --> 00:42:26.60
It's like, hey, this is the general idea and then we'll make adjustments as necessity

781
00:42:26.60 --> 00:42:31.12
directs or as we have opportunities.

782
00:42:31.12 --> 00:42:36.52
They should be made by the people who are going to execute them.

783
00:42:36.52 --> 00:42:37.52
Right?

784
00:42:37.52 --> 00:42:38.80
Incredible.

785
00:42:38.80 --> 00:42:43.12
Once again, these are things that I did and I, when I read that, I got the man that

786
00:42:43.12 --> 00:42:47.48
looked so lucky that I did that because the force of plan down someone's throat or

787
00:42:47.48 --> 00:42:56.72
make a, or even worse, take the problem, multiply it exponentially, force the plan down

788
00:42:56.72 --> 00:42:58.28
on the people below you.

789
00:42:58.28 --> 00:43:01.72
That is very detailed and doesn't have any flexibility.

790
00:43:01.72 --> 00:43:03.56
That's just failure.

791
00:43:03.56 --> 00:43:08.40
I'd get to see that man get to see some, some tasking to commander coming through training

792
00:43:08.40 --> 00:43:13.24
and look, the guy's not a bad human guy actually wants to get in fact wanting to do a

793
00:43:13.24 --> 00:43:18.32
good job can drive you to try and make a more detailed plan and force it down onto your

794
00:43:18.32 --> 00:43:19.32
people.

795
00:43:19.32 --> 00:43:21.60
That's not necessarily a person that's a bad leader.

796
00:43:21.60 --> 00:43:23.04
They just haven't learned the lesson yet.

797
00:43:23.04 --> 00:43:26.20
That might be a person that's super engaged.

798
00:43:26.20 --> 00:43:27.96
Once do a great job over a cheever.

799
00:43:27.96 --> 00:43:29.80
Hey, look, I know how to do this.

800
00:43:29.80 --> 00:43:32.60
It puts together this highly detailed plan.

801
00:43:32.60 --> 00:43:34.16
That's not a good call, man.

802
00:43:34.16 --> 00:43:38.72
It's nothing against the person, but you have to do that person is, show them the light.

803
00:43:38.72 --> 00:43:39.72
Right?

804
00:43:39.72 --> 00:43:43.12
You're going to bring them to the light.

805
00:43:43.12 --> 00:43:44.12
Okay.

806
00:43:44.12 --> 00:43:48.80
So then he goes through, it goes through a section on reconnaissance.

807
00:43:48.80 --> 00:43:50.60
You can never have too much reconnaissance.

808
00:43:50.60 --> 00:43:54.40
Use every means available before during an after battle.

809
00:43:54.40 --> 00:44:00.56
Reports must be facts not opinions negative as well as positive.

810
00:44:00.56 --> 00:44:03.60
Do not believe intercepts blindly.

811
00:44:03.60 --> 00:44:04.60
Crosscheck.

812
00:44:04.60 --> 00:44:06.48
Sometimes messages are not out to be intercepted.

813
00:44:06.48 --> 00:44:10.52
So a bunch of good little things to think about there.

814
00:44:10.52 --> 00:44:12.40
Reports must not must be facts not opinions.

815
00:44:12.40 --> 00:44:15.000
There's a term that uses the military.

816
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.76
It appears to be a T.B.

817
00:44:17.76 --> 00:44:23.36
So you'd see a person holding something.

818
00:44:23.36 --> 00:44:25.36
You're pretty sure it's a weapon, but you don't know.

819
00:44:25.36 --> 00:44:28.36
Then you say appears to be a weapon.

820
00:44:28.36 --> 00:44:37.04
It appears to be a weapon or you say people moving into a, in a, appears to be a tactical position.

821
00:44:37.04 --> 00:44:42.000
So it's just one of those little things because there's a huge difference between me

822
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.04
saying they were moving weapons into the building or they were moving what appeared to be

823
00:44:47.04 --> 00:44:48.32
weapons for the building.

824
00:44:48.32 --> 00:44:49.32
Right.

825
00:44:49.32 --> 00:44:50.32
Yeah.

826
00:44:50.32 --> 00:44:51.32
It's not an established fact.

827
00:44:51.32 --> 00:44:52.32
It's established fact.

828
00:44:52.32 --> 00:44:56.96
And if you remember when we talked about the me lime acircure, that's one of those things

829
00:44:56.96 --> 00:45:00.16
where the difference between appears to be.

830
00:45:00.16 --> 00:45:05.12
And this is could be, can kind of cause those kind of problem.

831
00:45:05.12 --> 00:45:08.92
Same thing with police shootings.

832
00:45:08.92 --> 00:45:09.92
Right.

833
00:45:09.92 --> 00:45:11.96
Someone saying, hey, this guy has a weapon.

834
00:45:11.96 --> 00:45:12.96
Yeah.

835
00:45:12.96 --> 00:45:14.36
Or this guy appears to have a weapon.

836
00:45:14.36 --> 00:45:17.88
There's a big difference between those two things.

837
00:45:17.88 --> 00:45:18.88
Yeah.

838
00:45:18.88 --> 00:45:24.04
The lead, like legal, when they're speaking like legal terms, they're always super careful

839
00:45:24.04 --> 00:45:25.04
about that.

840
00:45:25.04 --> 00:45:29.36
Like, oh, they'll say allegedly, or, you know, like, even though the guy just did it on camera.

841
00:45:29.36 --> 00:45:30.36
Yeah.

842
00:45:30.36 --> 00:45:31.36
Like, be a suspect.

843
00:45:31.36 --> 00:45:36.08
Even that, that's like a suspect I'm watching it right here on the video.

844
00:45:36.08 --> 00:45:37.08
Yeah.

845
00:45:37.08 --> 00:45:38.36
I'm not proven in the court a lot yet.

846
00:45:38.36 --> 00:45:41.44
So, you know, it's like a kind of that legal one.

847
00:45:41.44 --> 00:45:47.04
Next, sections about orders.

848
00:45:47.04 --> 00:45:48.36
Formal orders.

849
00:45:48.36 --> 00:45:54.80
Formal orders will be preceded by letters of instruction and by personal conferences.

850
00:45:54.80 --> 00:45:58.68
In this way, the whole purpose of the operation will be made clear together with the mission

851
00:45:58.68 --> 00:46:00.80
to be accomplished by each major unit.

852
00:46:00.80 --> 00:46:06.24
In this way, if communication breaks down during combat, each commander can and must so

853
00:46:06.24 --> 00:46:09.68
act as to attain the general objective.

854
00:46:09.68 --> 00:46:14.000
This is a little something we called decentralized command.

855
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Right?

856
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.84
Everyone has to know what the main objective is.

857
00:46:16.84 --> 00:46:22.32
So when communication breaks down, which it will, we can still move forward.

858
00:46:22.32 --> 00:46:25.64
The order itself will be short.

859
00:46:25.64 --> 00:46:28.52
A company via sketch.

860
00:46:28.52 --> 00:46:34.48
It tells what to do, not how.

861
00:46:34.48 --> 00:46:40.000
It is really a memorandum and assumption of responsibility by the issuing commander.

862
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.28
So I'll bunch of key things there.

863
00:46:42.28 --> 00:46:44.000
The order's supposed to be short.

864
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.40
The order's accompanied by a sketch.

865
00:46:47.40 --> 00:46:52.48
Once again, we get this visual representation thing seems to be important.

866
00:46:52.48 --> 00:46:53.60
And this is an important one.

867
00:46:53.60 --> 00:46:55.80
It tells what to do, not how.

868
00:46:55.80 --> 00:47:00.84
I have to brief people on that one all the time.

869
00:47:00.84 --> 00:47:06.04
So and you'll also notice this, four motors will be preceded by letters of instruction

870
00:47:06.04 --> 00:47:08.48
and by personal conferences.

871
00:47:08.48 --> 00:47:16.28
So a trick question that I ask companies when I'm working with them, what's better form

872
00:47:16.28 --> 00:47:24.20
of communication, email or voice or face to face.

873
00:47:24.20 --> 00:47:26.28
And of course everyone says voice, voice, voice, voice.

874
00:47:26.28 --> 00:47:27.28
They say face to face.

875
00:47:27.28 --> 00:47:29.84
I'll say what's more, what's a better form of communication?

876
00:47:29.84 --> 00:47:30.84
Email or phone call.

877
00:47:30.84 --> 00:47:33.04
And if it goes, oh, phone calls so much better.

878
00:47:33.04 --> 00:47:34.36
That's everyone's gut instinct.

879
00:47:34.36 --> 00:47:35.36
Oh, yeah.

880
00:47:35.36 --> 00:47:37.88
Talking to someone so much more clear.

881
00:47:37.88 --> 00:47:42.40
And then I say, okay, here's the problem with just talking.

882
00:47:42.40 --> 00:47:46.24
If we just talk, I say one thing, you hear something else.

883
00:47:46.24 --> 00:47:47.96
That all the time.

884
00:47:47.96 --> 00:47:51.16
So that's why I follow up when you and I have a conversation.

885
00:47:51.16 --> 00:47:53.44
I follow up with an email and say, I just want to make sure we're good on this.

886
00:47:53.44 --> 00:47:57.68
Make sure that we're going to do A, B, and C.

887
00:47:57.68 --> 00:48:00.16
And then you say, hey, I thought we were doing A, B, and D.

888
00:48:00.16 --> 00:48:01.24
And I said, oh, no, sorry.

889
00:48:01.24 --> 00:48:02.92
My phone, I didn't explain it clearly.

890
00:48:02.92 --> 00:48:03.92
So that's one way.

891
00:48:03.92 --> 00:48:06.72
The other thing is the opposite is also true.

892
00:48:06.72 --> 00:48:09.80
If I just send you an email, I want you to do this.

893
00:48:09.80 --> 00:48:12.40
There's no tone.

894
00:48:12.40 --> 00:48:14.000
There's no expression.

895
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.76
You might not see the importance.

896
00:48:15.76 --> 00:48:17.08
I might have written clearly.

897
00:48:17.08 --> 00:48:20.56
So if it's important, I send you an email and I say, hey, echo.

898
00:48:20.56 --> 00:48:25.000
Just following up to make sure that we're on the same page because I'm not always the best

899
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.76
at writing stuff.

900
00:48:26.76 --> 00:48:33.16
But when the email I just sent you, I wanted to make sure that you understood it was A, B,

901
00:48:33.16 --> 00:48:34.76
and C. Did that come through?

902
00:48:34.76 --> 00:48:36.80
And you're like, oh, yeah, definitely.

903
00:48:36.80 --> 00:48:38.84
Or you're like, wait a second.

904
00:48:38.84 --> 00:48:40.64
So you want to use both.

905
00:48:40.64 --> 00:48:43.08
And that's exactly what he's saying here.

906
00:48:43.08 --> 00:48:44.08
You write it.

907
00:48:44.08 --> 00:48:45.08
You speak it.

908
00:48:45.08 --> 00:48:46.08
You speak it.

909
00:48:46.08 --> 00:48:47.08
You write it.

910
00:48:47.08 --> 00:48:48.20
Yeah, you ever see those guys?

911
00:48:48.20 --> 00:48:51.16
Or talk to those guys where you talk to them.

912
00:48:51.16 --> 00:48:52.16
They're all excited.

913
00:48:52.16 --> 00:48:53.16
You can totally tell.

914
00:48:53.16 --> 00:48:59.08
And when they text you, it's like two, three, sometimes one word answers.

915
00:48:59.08 --> 00:49:04.56
And so you're kind of like, oh, man, he must be kind of mad because his tone now is way different

916
00:49:04.56 --> 00:49:07.16
than when I was talking to him or whatever.

917
00:49:07.16 --> 00:49:11.20
You sort of make your own interpretation of the thing, depending on like maybe, I don't

918
00:49:11.20 --> 00:49:13.60
know, maybe how you do it or something like that.

919
00:49:13.60 --> 00:49:15.36
But some people that's just how they write.

920
00:49:15.36 --> 00:49:17.88
First of all, they'll be like, hey, get back to me, period.

921
00:49:17.88 --> 00:49:19.20
And it's like, dang, this guy's mad.

922
00:49:19.20 --> 00:49:21.76
He wants me to get back to him.

923
00:49:21.76 --> 00:49:22.76
My son.

924
00:49:22.76 --> 00:49:28.12
And then his text is like, just the most horrible.

925
00:49:28.12 --> 00:49:29.12
Yeah, like you.

926
00:49:29.12 --> 00:49:30.12
Okay.

927
00:49:30.12 --> 00:49:31.12
Tcha.

928
00:49:31.12 --> 00:49:33.000
Then again, but you do express certain tones.

929
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.16
More comedic, I think, for comedic effect.

930
00:49:35.16 --> 00:49:38.44
Well, in my experience, anyway, I'm sure you have a whole thing.

931
00:49:38.44 --> 00:49:42.60
But yeah, when I was texting him, your boy, he same deal.

932
00:49:42.60 --> 00:49:47.68
He was like the younger version that he just says, no, what do you say?

933
00:49:47.68 --> 00:49:50.52
He was in a surf contest the other day.

934
00:49:50.52 --> 00:49:53.60
So he's, I was somewhere else.

935
00:49:53.60 --> 00:49:55.80
And, you know, I'm texting, hey, do you make it through the first teet?

936
00:49:55.80 --> 00:49:58.000
Because the way surf contest work, you surf in heats.

937
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.12
And you have to get in the top three and eat heat to advance.

938
00:50:00.12 --> 00:50:02.32
And then eventually you get in the finals.

939
00:50:02.32 --> 00:50:04.44
So I'm texting him.

940
00:50:04.44 --> 00:50:05.72
And this is a teenage boy, right?

941
00:50:05.72 --> 00:50:07.32
So it's not like he's not on his phone.

942
00:50:07.32 --> 00:50:08.32
I'm texting him.

943
00:50:08.32 --> 00:50:09.32
How'd you do?

944
00:50:09.32 --> 00:50:10.12
Hey, how'd the first teet go?

945
00:50:10.12 --> 00:50:11.32
Did you make it through?

946
00:50:11.32 --> 00:50:12.32
Nothing heard.

947
00:50:12.32 --> 00:50:14.12
Nothing heard all day.

948
00:50:14.12 --> 00:50:18.28
Finally, the end of the day.

949
00:50:18.28 --> 00:50:21.96
I say, hey, did you finish the contest?

950
00:50:21.96 --> 00:50:23.16
How did you do?

951
00:50:23.16 --> 00:50:29.32
He writes back, got to, which meant he got second place in the contest.

952
00:50:29.32 --> 00:50:30.80
That's all I said.

953
00:50:30.80 --> 00:50:32.80
All his small letters.

954
00:50:32.80 --> 00:50:33.80
Yeah.

955
00:50:33.80 --> 00:50:35.16
How does it even do small letters?

956
00:50:35.16 --> 00:50:37.88
Because it's automatically kept somehow on his phone.

957
00:50:37.88 --> 00:50:43.48
No automatic application says, got to, which is the 17 year old boys way of saying,

958
00:50:43.48 --> 00:50:45.92
hey, dad, I got second place today.

959
00:50:45.92 --> 00:50:50.56
Thanks for showing some concern and I appreciate your support as a father.

960
00:50:50.56 --> 00:50:51.56
I had a great time.

961
00:50:51.56 --> 00:50:52.56
That's all in there.

962
00:50:52.56 --> 00:50:53.56
Right?

963
00:50:53.56 --> 00:50:54.56
No.

964
00:50:54.56 --> 00:50:55.56
Got to.

965
00:50:55.56 --> 00:50:56.56
So anyways.

966
00:50:56.56 --> 00:50:57.56
Yeah.

967
00:50:57.56 --> 00:51:04.16
Follow up with, and you know, then when I called him later or whatever, he's like,

968
00:51:04.16 --> 00:51:06.68
oh, yeah, first, you know, he's giving me all the details.

969
00:51:06.68 --> 00:51:07.68
Got to.

970
00:51:07.68 --> 00:51:08.68
Yeah.

971
00:51:08.68 --> 00:51:15.60
And he talks about something called fragmentary orders, frag orders after the initial

972
00:51:15.60 --> 00:51:20.56
order, you will seldom get another formal order, but you may get fragmentary orders in

973
00:51:20.56 --> 00:51:24.08
writing or early by phone or personally.

974
00:51:24.08 --> 00:51:26.56
Take down all oral orders and repeat them back.

975
00:51:26.56 --> 00:51:28.04
Have your juniors do the same here.

976
00:51:28.04 --> 00:51:34.44
Again, can you imagine how many times and how important it says that this guy, general

977
00:51:34.44 --> 00:51:40.88
patent, by the way, is saying, listen, when you get told to do something, write it down and

978
00:51:40.88 --> 00:51:43.92
read it back.

979
00:51:43.92 --> 00:51:48.08
That's just the standard operating procedure for life when you get told to do something right

980
00:51:48.08 --> 00:51:49.84
it down, read it back.

981
00:51:49.84 --> 00:51:56.72
There's nothing that instills more confidence in me than when someone wants to do and they're

982
00:51:56.72 --> 00:51:57.72
taking notes on it.

983
00:51:57.72 --> 00:51:59.88
That's just, you go, okay, cool.

984
00:51:59.88 --> 00:52:05.68
I can barely even trust, look, I'm not saying this in a bad way, but I barely even

985
00:52:05.68 --> 00:52:08.96
trust waitresses or waiters.

986
00:52:08.96 --> 00:52:12.84
When I'm telling them what I want, and they're just looking at me like, I got this.

987
00:52:12.84 --> 00:52:13.84
I'm always nervous.

988
00:52:13.84 --> 00:52:19.16
I guess maybe in really bad writing, sometimes I can't help myself but I'll say, you

989
00:52:19.16 --> 00:52:20.16
must be pretty good.

990
00:52:20.16 --> 00:52:21.60
You know, I'm a bad guy, I got you.

991
00:52:21.60 --> 00:52:24.08
They're looking at me like, they do this all the time.

992
00:52:24.08 --> 00:52:29.32
Do you think that that's like a move like a flex for service industry, one of the

993
00:52:29.32 --> 00:52:30.88
like, oh yeah, I'm so good.

994
00:52:30.88 --> 00:52:34.32
A little bit of a flex and also just a skill, right?

995
00:52:34.32 --> 00:52:35.32
Right, right, that's what I'm doing.

996
00:52:35.32 --> 00:52:36.32
They're showing off the skill.

997
00:52:36.32 --> 00:52:39.48
Yeah, and sometimes I don't think they're showing off sometimes I just think that's

998
00:52:39.48 --> 00:52:40.48
what they do.

999
00:52:40.48 --> 00:52:44.16
Yeah, they're just trying to, you know, they're saying like, yeah, I got this.

1000
00:52:44.16 --> 00:52:46.80
That's what they do on an individual level or as a company.

1001
00:52:46.80 --> 00:52:52.24
Because that individual, that individuals like, hey, you know, go ahead, because you

1002
00:52:52.24 --> 00:52:55.08
know, I always want to order right now.

1003
00:52:55.08 --> 00:52:57.40
You know, when they come over to offer you water, I want to order that.

1004
00:52:57.40 --> 00:53:00.44
I don't want to, I don't want to go through this sequence.

1005
00:53:00.44 --> 00:53:03.44
When you come to me, I want to order, because I already know what I'm getting.

1006
00:53:03.44 --> 00:53:05.12
I'm getting a seizure salad and a ribeye.

1007
00:53:05.12 --> 00:53:06.12
That's already happening.

1008
00:53:06.12 --> 00:53:07.44
So we already know that walking into the place.

1009
00:53:07.44 --> 00:53:08.44
I don't need to look at the menu.

1010
00:53:08.44 --> 00:53:09.44
I don't want to look at the menu.

1011
00:53:09.44 --> 00:53:15.32
So when they come over and I say, they say, you know, they start pouring my water.

1012
00:53:15.32 --> 00:53:17.56
I say, I'm actually ready to order.

1013
00:53:17.56 --> 00:53:20.36
And sometimes they just like, I say, okay, go.

1014
00:53:20.36 --> 00:53:21.68
Kind of a pro move, right?

1015
00:53:21.68 --> 00:53:26.76
I think over time, I think over time I become more comfortable with it.

1016
00:53:26.76 --> 00:53:28.88
And now when someone does that, I know there are pro.

1017
00:53:28.88 --> 00:53:31.20
So I guess now I'm good with it.

1018
00:53:31.20 --> 00:53:32.44
I didn't use to be.

1019
00:53:32.44 --> 00:53:37.64
You know, when I transitioned from eating at, let's say, the restaurants where there's no

1020
00:53:37.64 --> 00:53:40.44
pros, right? Like a normal restaurant, people are just in there.

1021
00:53:40.44 --> 00:53:41.44
They're taking notes, right?

1022
00:53:41.44 --> 00:53:45.84
Oh, this is like, this is their secondary job, whatever their teenager, whatever.

1023
00:53:45.84 --> 00:53:50.20
Like this is they're just doing this to make whatever some extra money.

1024
00:53:50.20 --> 00:53:55.20
When you go to a real restaurant where there's pros, I have confidence in those people.

1025
00:53:55.20 --> 00:53:57.76
You until there's a mistake.

1026
00:53:57.76 --> 00:53:59.88
Oh, yes, yes.

1027
00:53:59.88 --> 00:54:03.48
But, and I think, I know this sucks with my wife literally.

1028
00:54:03.48 --> 00:54:05.28
And I asked her, was it day before?

1029
00:54:05.28 --> 00:54:09.60
When I went over very recently, the yesterday before we were at a sushi restaurant,

1030
00:54:09.60 --> 00:54:10.76
he was our first time there.

1031
00:54:10.76 --> 00:54:15.04
It was nice inside, but it was like, it was kind of new casual trendy nice.

1032
00:54:15.04 --> 00:54:15.60
Okay.

1033
00:54:15.60 --> 00:54:17.04
You know, that kind of little nervous little bit.

1034
00:54:17.04 --> 00:54:21.24
Kind of minimalist, but it's like, you know, if it's like, is this a high end restaurant

1035
00:54:21.24 --> 00:54:22.20
or just super train?

1036
00:54:22.20 --> 00:54:25.20
So the jury was still out on that whole situation.

1037
00:54:25.20 --> 00:54:27.28
So whatever, and then, you know, he pulled one of those.

1038
00:54:27.28 --> 00:54:28.40
I respected them for it.

1039
00:54:28.40 --> 00:54:32.92
I like what they do that on that level, but there is a question mark in the back

1040
00:54:32.92 --> 00:54:35.48
of the anime because I'm one of the annoying type order.

1041
00:54:35.48 --> 00:54:36.96
You've got special things, you know.

1042
00:54:36.96 --> 00:54:40.36
You've got to this and can have extra this and I don't want to, I don't want to cope

1043
00:54:40.36 --> 00:54:41.36
but until the final.

1044
00:54:41.36 --> 00:54:42.36
I've got this.

1045
00:54:42.36 --> 00:54:46.76
Also kind of like chess, you know, a good chess player is looking at the chess board in chunks.

1046
00:54:46.76 --> 00:54:48.20
So they don't have to remember every piece.

1047
00:54:48.20 --> 00:54:52.80
They're remembering whole schemes of maneuver that are going to happen.

1048
00:54:52.80 --> 00:54:53.80
Yeah.

1049
00:54:53.80 --> 00:54:59.28
When you're ordering in the restaurant, when you say, I want steak and see, like, they

1050
00:54:59.28 --> 00:55:03.12
are already in it. So they all actually are remembering is when you say, oh, I'd like

1051
00:55:03.12 --> 00:55:04.96
the peppercorn sauce medium, right?

1052
00:55:04.96 --> 00:55:06.48
That's the only thing they really need to remember.

1053
00:55:06.48 --> 00:55:07.64
They remembered everything else.

1054
00:55:07.64 --> 00:55:08.32
Yeah.

1055
00:55:08.32 --> 00:55:09.32
So yeah.

1056
00:55:09.32 --> 00:55:10.32
So yeah.

1057
00:55:10.32 --> 00:55:11.32
Yeah.

1058
00:55:11.32 --> 00:55:12.32
Yeah.

1059
00:55:12.32 --> 00:55:13.32
I'm with you though.

1060
00:55:13.32 --> 00:55:17.32
Like, when I, if someone's like, boom, boom, they're on it and they bring everything,

1061
00:55:17.32 --> 00:55:18.60
especially the annoying sides.

1062
00:55:18.60 --> 00:55:19.60
Okay.

1063
00:55:19.60 --> 00:55:23.20
So me and my wife's like, this too, where she'll be like, can I, she want different sauces

1064
00:55:23.20 --> 00:55:26.40
that you don't normally get with it, you know, like that kind, me too.

1065
00:55:26.40 --> 00:55:27.40
And then I'm, yeah.

1066
00:55:27.40 --> 00:55:32.16
No, it's a, it's a, it's a pain to have those specialty requests.

1067
00:55:32.16 --> 00:55:34.24
But it's so, it makes it so much better.

1068
00:55:34.24 --> 00:55:38.28
But nonetheless, if, if they come through with that, boom, without being quote, what

1069
00:55:38.28 --> 00:55:41.52
reminded, I don't even, me saying, remind it like a.

1070
00:55:41.52 --> 00:55:46.32
It sounds condescending, but I think it's not just, don't give you what you asked for.

1071
00:55:46.32 --> 00:55:48.56
What do you just suck it up and just deal with it?

1072
00:55:48.56 --> 00:55:51.40
Or do you say something?

1073
00:55:51.40 --> 00:55:52.40
Which one?

1074
00:55:52.40 --> 00:55:53.40
What, like, what do you mean say something?

1075
00:55:53.40 --> 00:55:54.40
Okay.

1076
00:55:54.40 --> 00:55:58.000
I'm gonna get this or whatever, with a, with a, with a, but they don't, they do they

1077
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.72
actually, for guilty or they act just super annoyed.

1078
00:56:00.72 --> 00:56:07.56
Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't remember any time anyone, I'm acting annoyed, but have

1079
00:56:07.56 --> 00:56:11.28
you ever, I've done that where I've asked for some little specific thing and then they

1080
00:56:11.28 --> 00:56:12.28
don't deliver.

1081
00:56:12.28 --> 00:56:15.76
And then I say, hey, you know, I actually asked for this and they're like, and they're

1082
00:56:15.76 --> 00:56:17.16
acting annoyed at me.

1083
00:56:17.16 --> 00:56:18.16
Yeah.

1084
00:56:18.16 --> 00:56:20.16
I can see how that can happen.

1085
00:56:20.16 --> 00:56:21.56
And I can see why I deserve it, right?

1086
00:56:21.56 --> 00:56:23.96
So I asked if I could, but this one feels too.

1087
00:56:23.96 --> 00:56:28.40
So I, when somebody messes something up, I'm kind of like, okay, well, that's just, this

1088
00:56:28.40 --> 00:56:29.40
is how it is all.

1089
00:56:29.40 --> 00:56:33.08
Yeah, I feel like I'm jamming up the whole system because I use the work service

1090
00:56:33.08 --> 00:56:34.08
industry long time.

1091
00:56:34.08 --> 00:56:38.88
So the, you know, you have a system and it works so good, especially when you're dealing

1092
00:56:38.88 --> 00:56:42.28
with like people after people, you know, group, and group, it like all day and the system

1093
00:56:42.28 --> 00:56:43.28
works so good.

1094
00:56:43.28 --> 00:56:47.52
And it's probably formulated off of like something, something that everyone's cooperating

1095
00:56:47.52 --> 00:56:48.52
with, they'll tell you that.

1096
00:56:48.52 --> 00:56:49.52
It's working.

1097
00:56:49.52 --> 00:56:50.52
And I'm not cooperating.

1098
00:56:50.52 --> 00:56:53.52
I feel, because I'm the customer who's not technically cooperating, you know, because

1099
00:56:53.52 --> 00:56:54.84
it starts with what drinks.

1100
00:56:54.84 --> 00:56:55.84
Hi, everybody sit down.

1101
00:56:55.84 --> 00:56:57.84
We, you know, one minute should be like one minute.

1102
00:56:57.84 --> 00:57:01.84
Water drinks, water drinks, you want anything to drink besides water, blah, blah, blah,

1103
00:57:01.84 --> 00:57:02.84
me.

1104
00:57:02.84 --> 00:57:03.84
I'm like, map tagers.

1105
00:57:03.84 --> 00:57:04.84
But yeah.

1106
00:57:04.84 --> 00:57:07.000
So, bro, I'm looking like, yeah, I do want a drink, but how's this?

1107
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.56
The drink, I want the drink to come with the food already jamming up the whole system.

1108
00:57:10.56 --> 00:57:12.24
So they should be annoyed with me.

1109
00:57:12.24 --> 00:57:15.44
In fact, I want to say they should be, but if they're annoyed with me, I understand.

1110
00:57:15.44 --> 00:57:16.88
Oh, I'm annoying or Eddie.

1111
00:57:16.88 --> 00:57:18.16
And it doesn't stop there.

1112
00:57:18.16 --> 00:57:20.16
But they'll bring out the sushi, whatever.

1113
00:57:20.16 --> 00:57:23.48
It'll be like, hey, can I have two sides of the extra, so I'd be, say, you'll sauce and

1114
00:57:23.48 --> 00:57:24.48
Terry Oki sauce.

1115
00:57:24.48 --> 00:57:25.48
I'm just going to have Terry Oki sauce.

1116
00:57:25.48 --> 00:57:26.48
You're going to say, oh, this guy.

1117
00:57:26.48 --> 00:57:29.56
You're just ordered like, everybody in here is doing the game.

1118
00:57:29.56 --> 00:57:30.92
You're over here doing all this stuff.

1119
00:57:30.92 --> 00:57:33.36
I'm over here trying to memorize your order without writing it down and you're

1120
00:57:33.36 --> 00:57:34.36
over throwing this at me.

1121
00:57:34.36 --> 00:57:35.36
You know, so I understand.

1122
00:57:35.36 --> 00:57:39.44
But I think, well, to my point earlier, they don't have to memorize your

1123
00:57:39.44 --> 00:57:40.44
order.

1124
00:57:40.44 --> 00:57:43.000
They're just like, oh, this guy has got these two things that are outside the normal

1125
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000
box.

1126
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000
This is only really two things after.

1127
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.40
I think, yeah, but I think that's what happens.

1128
00:57:47.40 --> 00:57:48.80
I think you're right.

1129
00:57:48.80 --> 00:57:52.44
All this means look, you're a leader.

1130
00:57:52.44 --> 00:57:53.36
You're a junior leader.

1131
00:57:53.36 --> 00:57:55.08
Your boss is going to tell you do something.

1132
00:57:55.08 --> 00:57:56.36
Do yourself a favor.

1133
00:57:56.36 --> 00:57:57.52
Do your boss a favor.

1134
00:57:57.52 --> 00:57:59.16
Don't make him wonder if you're a waiter or a waiter.

1135
00:57:59.16 --> 00:58:00.64
It's not going to handle this scenario.

1136
00:58:00.64 --> 00:58:01.88
Don't make him wonder that.

1137
00:58:01.88 --> 00:58:06.20
You whip out your notebook and you go, hey, boss, let me just read this back to you.

1138
00:58:06.20 --> 00:58:08.04
You told me, because I want to get this 100% right.

1139
00:58:08.04 --> 00:58:09.96
And you say, okay, awesome.

1140
00:58:09.96 --> 00:58:10.96
Up the comments level.

1141
00:58:10.96 --> 00:58:11.96
Good idea.

1142
00:58:11.96 --> 00:58:15.08
That's my recommendation.

1143
00:58:15.08 --> 00:58:18.76
Next section, warning orders, warning orders are vital and must be issued in time.

1144
00:58:18.76 --> 00:58:24.44
This requirement applies not only to combat units, but also the surgeon signal officer

1145
00:58:24.44 --> 00:58:28.32
quarterback master and ordinance officer engineering officer who must get warning orders

1146
00:58:28.32 --> 00:58:29.32
promptly.

1147
00:58:29.32 --> 00:58:30.76
They too have plans to make.

1148
00:58:30.76 --> 00:58:34.68
And warning orders is the initial thing that you tell the troops, hey, we might

1149
00:58:34.68 --> 00:58:35.68
be attacking.

1150
00:58:35.68 --> 00:58:36.68
Get ready for this.

1151
00:58:36.68 --> 00:58:37.68
That's a warning order.

1152
00:58:37.68 --> 00:58:39.68
I sent somebody a warning order the other day.

1153
00:58:39.68 --> 00:58:40.68
Oh, yeah.

1154
00:58:40.68 --> 00:58:42.68
I remember who to us.

1155
00:58:42.68 --> 00:58:44.88
You know, I literally, because he's another team guy.

1156
00:58:44.88 --> 00:58:47.20
And I said, hey, here's a warning order.

1157
00:58:47.20 --> 00:58:49.20
You call it a warning order, like classified.

1158
00:58:49.20 --> 00:58:50.20
Here's the warning order.

1159
00:58:50.20 --> 00:58:51.64
Because I was just giving the heads up.

1160
00:58:51.64 --> 00:58:53.64
We got a possible scenario.

1161
00:58:53.64 --> 00:58:54.64
I'll do that too.

1162
00:58:54.64 --> 00:58:56.44
I'll say new mission though.

1163
00:58:56.44 --> 00:58:59.32
All indicate what this is coming.

1164
00:58:59.32 --> 00:59:01.36
So here's the thing with that.

1165
00:59:01.36 --> 00:59:04.96
New mission means you're going to tell them exactly what's going on.

1166
00:59:04.96 --> 00:59:11.08
Warning order, you give them just because warning order is just a heads up.

1167
00:59:11.08 --> 00:59:12.08
Right?

1168
00:59:12.08 --> 00:59:13.08
This might be happening.

1169
00:59:13.08 --> 00:59:15.52
Here's kind of the general thing we think is going to be happening.

1170
00:59:15.52 --> 00:59:17.16
You can give it to them a little bit earlier.

1171
00:59:17.16 --> 00:59:21.92
You mission means now you got all this prep to do because you didn't get a warning order.

1172
00:59:21.92 --> 00:59:22.92
Oh, my stuff.

1173
00:59:22.92 --> 00:59:23.92
Step up your game.

1174
00:59:23.92 --> 00:59:26.20
Keep trying.

1175
00:59:26.20 --> 00:59:30.000
Next, keep troops informed.

1176
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.60
Use every means before and after combat to tell troops what they're going to do and

1177
00:59:34.60 --> 00:59:35.80
what they have done.

1178
00:59:35.80 --> 00:59:36.80
Boom, there you go.

1179
00:59:36.80 --> 00:59:42.24
I believe there's a whole section in the book called Leadership Strategy and Tactics.

1180
00:59:42.24 --> 00:59:47.12
And I think it's literally called to keep the troops informed.

1181
00:59:47.12 --> 00:59:50.36
Next administration supply.

1182
00:59:50.36 --> 00:59:52.68
I was thinking, all you know, I'll skip this because whatever.

1183
00:59:52.68 --> 00:59:54.36
No, here's what it says.

1184
00:59:54.36 --> 01:00:00.68
The onus of supply rests equally on the giver and the taker.

1185
01:00:00.68 --> 01:00:03.84
That is so important.

1186
01:00:03.84 --> 01:00:08.04
Instead of hey, we, we, we, we, we, we, we're our dang supplies.

1187
01:00:08.04 --> 01:00:09.04
It's their fault.

1188
01:00:09.04 --> 01:00:11.44
It's like no, actually it's my fault.

1189
01:00:11.44 --> 01:00:16.64
And then he says this for units must anticipate needs and ask for supplies in time.

1190
01:00:16.64 --> 01:00:20.56
They must stand ready to use all their means to help supplies.

1191
01:00:20.56 --> 01:00:23.44
The supplies service must get the things asked for to the right place at the right

1192
01:00:23.44 --> 01:00:24.44
time.

1193
01:00:24.44 --> 01:00:26.04
They, they must do more.

1194
01:00:26.04 --> 01:00:30.88
By reconnaissance, they will anticipate demands and start the supplies up before

1195
01:00:30.88 --> 01:00:32.88
they're called for.

1196
01:00:32.88 --> 01:00:35.32
So this is what's interesting.

1197
01:00:35.32 --> 01:00:40.36
You see both sides have to take extreme ownership of the delivery of the supplies.

1198
01:00:40.36 --> 01:00:45.88
And what you get is you get inner locking fields of fire overlapping.

1199
01:00:45.88 --> 01:00:49.92
So inner locking and overlapping fields of fire, which is a good Zach Lee.

1200
01:00:49.92 --> 01:00:50.92
What you want.

1201
01:00:50.92 --> 01:00:58.28
Meaning overlapping fields of fire, meaning yours, I'm shooting to the north west and

1202
01:00:58.28 --> 01:01:03.28
your shooting also part of your coverage is to the north west, but then you're to get a

1203
01:01:03.28 --> 01:01:04.84
little bit more to the east too.

1204
01:01:04.84 --> 01:01:09.44
So we're both looking and we're overlapping overlapping fields of fire.

1205
01:01:09.44 --> 01:01:10.68
That's what we want.

1206
01:01:10.68 --> 01:01:15.04
And that's what that's what when you have extreme ownership on both sides, you get overlapping

1207
01:01:15.04 --> 01:01:20.56
fields of fire, which means the chances of something being missed are less because the

1208
01:01:20.56 --> 01:01:22.56
fields of fire are overlapping.

1209
01:01:22.56 --> 01:01:25.56
Oh, both got it come never said that before.

1210
01:01:25.56 --> 01:01:26.56
It's good.

1211
01:01:26.56 --> 01:01:32.92
Yeah, because even field of fire overlap, almost like I'm going to clean up that analogy.

1212
01:01:32.92 --> 01:01:35.28
And that's going to end up being a very powerful analogy.

1213
01:01:35.28 --> 01:01:38.48
Yeah, it's like you both got it covered, you know, you both got it come down.

1214
01:01:38.48 --> 01:01:43.24
I say something close to it a lot, which is, you know, I say, look, when every person

1215
01:01:43.24 --> 01:01:46.000
whenever in the chain of command is taking ownership of the problems of problems, it's

1216
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
solved.

1217
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.48
There's more to it than that because when you take ownership of the problem and I take

1218
01:01:50.48 --> 01:01:56.20
ownership of the same problem, there's overlapping fields of fire and we will kill that

1219
01:01:56.20 --> 01:01:59.96
problem because you're going to see it from your angle, maybe you get 80% of it solved.

1220
01:01:59.96 --> 01:02:03.76
I got that other 20% double inch.

1221
01:02:03.76 --> 01:02:04.76
Yes.

1222
01:02:04.76 --> 01:02:11.88
And then it says this, the desperate determination to succeed is just as vital to supply

1223
01:02:11.88 --> 01:02:17.64
as it is to the firing line, the desperate determination.

1224
01:02:17.64 --> 01:02:21.44
Meaning, look, guys in the front line, we know their lives are in danger.

1225
01:02:21.44 --> 01:02:26.20
Supply has to have the same attitude, logistics wins the wars.

1226
01:02:26.20 --> 01:02:30.16
They got a chunk in here on replacements, they got a chunk in here on hospitals, they got

1227
01:02:30.16 --> 01:02:33.56
a chunk in here on decorations.

1228
01:02:33.56 --> 01:02:37.64
Decorations are for the purpose of raising the fighting value of troops.

1229
01:02:37.64 --> 01:02:43.28
Therefore, they must be awarded promptly, have a definite officer on your staff, educated

1230
01:02:43.28 --> 01:02:46.48
in writing citations and see that they get through.

1231
01:02:46.48 --> 01:02:49.16
Boy, we don't do a good job of this anymore.

1232
01:02:49.16 --> 01:02:54.92
The awards process is painful.

1233
01:02:54.92 --> 01:02:56.96
Next section is on discipline.

1234
01:02:56.96 --> 01:03:01.88
Anyways, going back to decorations real quick, that means when you're running a business,

1235
01:03:01.88 --> 01:03:06.44
when you're running a team and someone does something well, recognize and for it.

1236
01:03:06.44 --> 01:03:11.24
Technically, promptly, it means something.

1237
01:03:11.24 --> 01:03:15.84
The next section is called discipline, which we're definitely fond of.

1238
01:03:15.84 --> 01:03:19.56
There's only one kind of discipline, perfect discipline.

1239
01:03:19.56 --> 01:03:27.40
If you do not enforce and maintain discipline, you are potential mergers.

1240
01:03:27.40 --> 01:03:29.56
You must set the example.

1241
01:03:29.56 --> 01:03:31.28
Check.

1242
01:03:31.28 --> 01:03:35.36
Believe me, Paton is into discipline.

1243
01:03:35.36 --> 01:03:37.40
We're going to read another section that goes into.

1244
01:03:37.40 --> 01:03:38.68
That's always got in here.

1245
01:03:38.68 --> 01:03:43.12
Next section of rumors reports based on information secured through reconnaissance conducted

1246
01:03:43.12 --> 01:03:46.48
afterdark should be viewed with skepticism.

1247
01:03:46.48 --> 01:03:51.88
The same thing applies to reports from walking wounded and stragglers.

1248
01:03:51.88 --> 01:03:57.20
These latter seem to justify themselves by painting alarming pictures.

1249
01:03:57.20 --> 01:04:03.88
That's a very astute observation.

1250
01:04:03.88 --> 01:04:11.80
What I get guys that are coming back that are wounded or walking wounded or was stragglers,

1251
01:04:11.80 --> 01:04:14.44
they're telling, I could so bad.

1252
01:04:14.44 --> 01:04:17.88
Because they don't want to look bad.

1253
01:04:17.88 --> 01:04:24.12
He says it is risky and usually impossible to move reserves during darkness on every call

1254
01:04:24.12 --> 01:04:25.12
for help.

1255
01:04:25.12 --> 01:04:27.20
Units cannot be wholly destroyed in the night attack.

1256
01:04:27.20 --> 01:04:29.48
They must stick.

1257
01:04:29.48 --> 01:04:33.68
Launch your counterattack after daylight and subsequent to adequate reconnaissance and see

1258
01:04:33.68 --> 01:04:34.68
that it's coordinated.

1259
01:04:34.68 --> 01:04:36.28
That's a good one.

1260
01:04:36.28 --> 01:04:43.40
What that basically means is to me, when you defeat someone, you need to go in there and

1261
01:04:43.40 --> 01:04:49.40
finish it off 100%.

1262
01:04:49.40 --> 01:04:53.12
Condition by that means conditioning, by that means physical conditioning.

1263
01:04:53.12 --> 01:04:56.88
High physical condition is vital to victory.

1264
01:04:56.88 --> 01:05:04.84
There are more tired core and division commanders than there are tired core and divisions.

1265
01:05:04.84 --> 01:05:08.12
Fatigue makes powers of us all.

1266
01:05:08.12 --> 01:05:11.44
Man in condition do not tire.

1267
01:05:11.44 --> 01:05:15.96
The last one is courage, do not take counsel of your fears, which he seems to write that

1268
01:05:15.96 --> 01:05:16.96
all the time.

1269
01:05:16.96 --> 01:05:19.04
There's a good reason for it.

1270
01:05:19.04 --> 01:05:23.84
You're going to be afraid, don't listen to it, don't negotiate with it.

1271
01:05:23.84 --> 01:05:26.12
Signed who can a general US Army commanding.

1272
01:05:26.12 --> 01:05:28.96
So that was letter of instruction number one.

1273
01:05:28.96 --> 01:05:34.64
Now we're going to jump into this one came out a little bit later, letter of instruction

1274
01:05:34.64 --> 01:05:37.48
number two.

1275
01:05:37.48 --> 01:05:43.40
This letter stresses those tactical administrative uses which combat experience has taught

1276
01:05:43.40 --> 01:05:50.16
myself and the officers who have served under me to consider vital.

1277
01:05:50.16 --> 01:05:55.32
And it says you will not simply mimeograph this and call it a day.

1278
01:05:55.32 --> 01:06:01.84
You are responsible that these uses just become habitual in your command.

1279
01:06:01.84 --> 01:06:13.04
Even in war 1944, we're getting ready to invade France and fight the Nazis.

1280
01:06:13.04 --> 01:06:20.96
We're going to embark on the most on the largest attack assault ever in the history of the

1281
01:06:20.96 --> 01:06:21.96
world.

1282
01:06:21.96 --> 01:06:22.96
That's what we're doing.

1283
01:06:22.96 --> 01:06:26.48
And guess what, he's still saying, look, you can't just mimeograph this.

1284
01:06:26.48 --> 01:06:29.88
It called dates even men even with all that.

1285
01:06:29.88 --> 01:06:32.36
You got officers that are like, okay, boss put out some word here.

1286
01:06:32.36 --> 01:06:33.76
You can read it.

1287
01:06:33.76 --> 01:06:35.000
No.

1288
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.64
This idea of hate just putting out the word, being enough.

1289
01:06:40.64 --> 01:06:45.40
This reflects what he said last time about 10%, 90%, 10%, 10% to give in the order.

1290
01:06:45.40 --> 01:06:48.76
90% is personally ensuring it gets done.

1291
01:06:48.76 --> 01:06:51.48
Taking ownership of it.

1292
01:06:51.48 --> 01:06:53.12
That's what he's talking about.

1293
01:06:53.12 --> 01:06:55.84
That is exactly what he's talking about.

1294
01:06:55.84 --> 01:06:57.92
Okay, so he starts to offer that.

1295
01:06:57.92 --> 01:07:06.24
Then he goes right into discipline, which as I said, he's a believer in the power of discipline.

1296
01:07:06.24 --> 01:07:09.000
So he says there's only one sort of discipline perfect.

1297
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.80
I'm reading it kind of without much vigor because I've read it before.

1298
01:07:13.80 --> 01:07:14.80
He says it all the time.

1299
01:07:14.80 --> 01:07:18.84
I'm going to read it again with vigor because it deserves some.

1300
01:07:18.84 --> 01:07:23.24
There is only one sort of discipline perfect discipline.

1301
01:07:23.24 --> 01:07:29.000
Men cannot have good battle discipline and poor administrative discipline.

1302
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.04
Oh, imagine that.

1303
01:07:32.04 --> 01:07:37.12
You can't just be all laks, kidesical, back behind in garrison doing the administrative

1304
01:07:37.12 --> 01:07:42.000
stuff and then expect you're going to have discipline when it's for combat related subjects.

1305
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.56
You got to have it across the board.

1306
01:07:43.56 --> 01:07:46.16
Good.

1307
01:07:46.16 --> 01:07:51.28
Discipline is based on pride and the profession of arms on meticulous attention to details

1308
01:07:51.28 --> 01:07:55.24
and on mutual respect and confidence.

1309
01:07:55.24 --> 01:08:00.56
Discipline must be a habit, so ingrained that it is stronger than the excitement of battle

1310
01:08:00.56 --> 01:08:05.56
or the fear of death.

1311
01:08:05.56 --> 01:08:07.84
Shhh.

1312
01:08:07.84 --> 01:08:13.64
Have you ever seen the movie?

1313
01:08:13.64 --> 01:08:15.64
Soldier.

1314
01:08:15.64 --> 01:08:18.000
This could be a good one.

1315
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
You're going to have to go watch this one.

1316
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Who's in now or what?

1317
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Which one is that?

1318
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.08
The movie is called Soldier.

1319
01:08:25.08 --> 01:08:27.08
It stars a guy named.

1320
01:08:27.08 --> 01:08:31.88
It stars a famous guy.

1321
01:08:31.88 --> 01:08:34.88
And I can't think of his name right now.

1322
01:08:34.88 --> 01:08:38.48
But he was in tombstone.

1323
01:08:38.48 --> 01:08:39.64
And it's not.

1324
01:08:39.64 --> 01:08:42.36
He looks like Patrick Swazie.

1325
01:08:42.36 --> 01:08:43.36
Velkillmer?

1326
01:08:43.36 --> 01:08:44.36
No.

1327
01:08:44.36 --> 01:08:46.48
No, he's real famous.

1328
01:08:46.48 --> 01:08:48.12
He's really famous actor.

1329
01:08:48.12 --> 01:08:49.88
Well, so a tombstone that was Kurt Russell.

1330
01:08:49.88 --> 01:08:50.88
Yes, Kurt Russell.

1331
01:08:50.88 --> 01:08:52.56
Okay, so Kurt Russell's in this movie soldier.

1332
01:08:52.56 --> 01:08:54.72
You've got to watch this movie.

1333
01:08:54.72 --> 01:08:57.40
This movie is a really good movie.

1334
01:08:57.40 --> 01:08:58.68
Think about what I'm saying right now.

1335
01:08:58.68 --> 01:09:02.36
This movie is a really good, and it's not only surprising that I'm saying that because

1336
01:09:02.36 --> 01:09:05.12
it's like a sci-fi movie.

1337
01:09:05.12 --> 01:09:06.12
Yeah.

1338
01:09:06.12 --> 01:09:07.12
Okay.

1339
01:09:07.12 --> 01:09:10.12
It's a sci-fi movie.

1340
01:09:10.12 --> 01:09:13.52
It's pretty on the surface.

1341
01:09:13.52 --> 01:09:14.52
You got okay.

1342
01:09:14.52 --> 01:09:17.72
You can barely, it's a kind of movie you'd flip through in the video, stormy like

1343
01:09:17.72 --> 01:09:18.72
whatever another thing.

1344
01:09:18.72 --> 01:09:20.72
It looks just like any other cheesy movie.

1345
01:09:20.72 --> 01:09:22.12
It's a good movie.

1346
01:09:22.12 --> 01:09:23.88
Soldier.

1347
01:09:23.88 --> 01:09:25.08
At one point in the movie.

1348
01:09:25.08 --> 01:09:28.16
So he's this guy that's been fighting wars his whole life.

1349
01:09:28.16 --> 01:09:35.64
And they're being replaced by cybernetic soldiers.

1350
01:09:35.64 --> 01:09:40.56
And so he gets like sent to a space junkyard.

1351
01:09:40.56 --> 01:09:44.52
And on the space junkyard, there's people that kind of live there that have their own

1352
01:09:44.52 --> 01:09:46.32
little society.

1353
01:09:46.32 --> 01:09:47.88
And he shows up there.

1354
01:09:47.88 --> 01:09:51.44
And he starts trying to long story.

1355
01:09:51.44 --> 01:09:57.08
But at one point, this woman asks him,

1356
01:09:57.08 --> 01:10:01.20
because he just, he just is, he's just like a perfect soldier.

1357
01:10:01.20 --> 01:10:02.20
Right?

1358
01:10:02.20 --> 01:10:03.20
Two.

1359
01:10:03.20 --> 01:10:10.84
The one point is woman, she says something along the lines of, do you ever feel anything?

1360
01:10:10.84 --> 01:10:14.36
And he says, I don't even think he says yes sir.

1361
01:10:14.36 --> 01:10:17.08
He calls everyone sir, even the even females.

1362
01:10:17.08 --> 01:10:26.76
I think he says something along the lines of yes sir, fear and discipline.

1363
01:10:26.76 --> 01:10:27.76
Yes.

1364
01:10:27.76 --> 01:10:28.76
Yes.

1365
01:10:28.76 --> 01:10:30.76
Sounds like you're kind of moving.

1366
01:10:30.76 --> 01:10:31.76
Yes.

1367
01:10:31.76 --> 01:10:36.36
And the other cool thing about this movie, the movie has, I want to say the first half an hour.

1368
01:10:36.36 --> 01:10:37.36
There's no speaking.

1369
01:10:37.36 --> 01:10:39.64
There's no dialogue.

1370
01:10:39.64 --> 01:10:43.68
They're showing the kids being selected and trained.

1371
01:10:43.68 --> 01:10:46.84
So the kid that can't keep up with the run, they kill him.

1372
01:10:46.84 --> 01:10:51.76
This is like my dreams aside.

1373
01:10:51.76 --> 01:10:53.76
There you go.

1374
01:10:53.76 --> 01:10:58.52
So I'm going to go watch this tonight if I can't guess I will too.

1375
01:10:58.52 --> 01:11:00.20
You're going to love this movie.

1376
01:11:00.20 --> 01:11:02.16
Well yeah, I'm familiar with it actually.

1377
01:11:02.16 --> 01:11:07.20
So when you said the sci-fi, I was like, okay, I think I know what you're talking about.

1378
01:11:07.20 --> 01:11:10.40
The bad kind of kind of marginal, special effects and stuff.

1379
01:11:10.40 --> 01:11:14.64
Yeah, they need to remake that movie with me in it.

1380
01:11:14.64 --> 01:11:16.88
Hey, they have tattoos.

1381
01:11:16.88 --> 01:11:19.20
I think they have tattoos either on their armor, on their face.

1382
01:11:19.20 --> 01:11:21.52
Oh, they have their rank on their face.

1383
01:11:21.52 --> 01:11:25.16
But then they have tattoos of the, like the barcoters.

1384
01:11:25.16 --> 01:11:30.000
Yeah, they have a barcode, but then they have the tattoos of the campaigns in which they've

1385
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000
served.

1386
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.48
Oh, no, he's looking at it.

1387
01:11:34.48 --> 01:11:39.56
So fear and discipline.

1388
01:11:39.56 --> 01:11:41.56
That's what life is as a soldier.

1389
01:11:41.56 --> 01:11:43.60
Okay, you're afraid, but guess what?

1390
01:11:43.60 --> 01:11:45.80
You have discipline, you overcome it.

1391
01:11:45.80 --> 01:11:50.08
And according to Paton, discipline must be a habit, so ingrained, that is stronger than

1392
01:11:50.08 --> 01:11:54.12
the excitement of battle or the fear of death.

1393
01:11:54.12 --> 01:11:58.64
And if you think about, just think about that word excitement, right?

1394
01:11:58.64 --> 01:12:00.60
That this is an only applied battle.

1395
01:12:00.60 --> 01:12:05.04
Think if you can have enough discipline that when there's stressful situations occurring

1396
01:12:05.04 --> 01:12:08.52
around you, you have the discipline to be able to take this step back in the touch and

1397
01:12:08.52 --> 01:12:10.16
set it getting wrapped up in it.

1398
01:12:10.16 --> 01:12:13.12
That's discipline.

1399
01:12:13.12 --> 01:12:17.12
Every day life, he continues on talking about discipline.

1400
01:12:17.12 --> 01:12:23.96
The history of our, of our invariably victorious armies demonstrates that we are the best

1401
01:12:23.96 --> 01:12:25.96
soldiers in the world.

1402
01:12:25.96 --> 01:12:27.84
This should make your men proud.

1403
01:12:27.84 --> 01:12:29.56
This should make you proud.

1404
01:12:29.56 --> 01:12:35.60
This should imbue your units with unconscribable self confidence and pride in demonstrated

1405
01:12:35.60 --> 01:12:39.60
ability.

1406
01:12:39.60 --> 01:12:44.88
discipline can only be obtained when all officers are so imbued with the sense of their

1407
01:12:44.88 --> 01:12:54.16
awful obligation to their men and to their country that they cannot tolerate negligence.

1408
01:12:54.16 --> 01:13:00.84
Officers who fail to correct errors or to praise excellence are valueless in peace and

1409
01:13:00.84 --> 01:13:08.32
dangerous misfits in war.

1410
01:13:08.32 --> 01:13:10.32
Boom.

1411
01:13:10.32 --> 01:13:16.04
So think about that.

1412
01:13:16.04 --> 01:13:18.04
Have you ever heard leadership described as an awful obligation?

1413
01:13:18.04 --> 01:13:26.32
That is the most exquisite choice of words that I've heard in the long time.

1414
01:13:26.32 --> 01:13:35.88
That's what it is, an awful obligation to the men and their country.

1415
01:13:35.88 --> 01:13:43.000
Use officers must assert themselves by example and by voice they must be preeminent, encourage

1416
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.12
deportment and dress.

1417
01:13:47.12 --> 01:13:51.72
One of the primary purposes of discipline is to produce alertness, a man who is so

1418
01:13:51.72 --> 01:14:00.40
a phargic that he fails to salute will fall easy victim to an enemy.

1419
01:14:00.40 --> 01:14:05.12
Combat experience is proven that ceremonies such as formal guard mounts or formal retreat

1420
01:14:05.12 --> 01:14:10.92
formations and regular and supervised revelry formations are a great help and in some cases

1421
01:14:10.92 --> 01:14:16.28
essential to prepare men and officers for battle to give them that perfect discipline, the

1422
01:14:16.28 --> 01:14:21.52
smartness of appearance that alertness without which battles cannot be won.

1423
01:14:21.52 --> 01:14:23.72
So he's all into that.

1424
01:14:23.72 --> 01:14:26.04
All of his revelry formations.

1425
01:14:26.04 --> 01:14:30.96
Reveal his wake up when we had Joe Lohn from the French Foreign Legion, what they call

1426
01:14:30.96 --> 01:14:36.04
a pal, that's revely and wake up and get in line and retreat formal retreat formation.

1427
01:14:36.04 --> 01:14:40.48
A retreat formation is putting down the flag like as the end of the day, hey we're done

1428
01:14:40.48 --> 01:14:41.48
for the day.

1429
01:14:41.48 --> 01:14:44.88
Even when you're in Garrison you do that formally.

1430
01:14:44.88 --> 01:14:49.48
So by the way, none of this stuff you never do any of this stuff in the sealed teams.

1431
01:14:49.48 --> 01:14:50.72
Barely ever.

1432
01:14:50.72 --> 01:14:55.80
The only time we'll do is if something's gone on, you can punch a kick, guys get in trouble.

1433
01:14:55.80 --> 01:14:58.12
All of us on, they'll start saying, we're going to be there every morning and we're

1434
01:14:58.12 --> 01:15:00.84
going to be there every morning.

1435
01:15:00.84 --> 01:15:02.16
You know, I want you to miss fits.

1436
01:15:02.16 --> 01:15:03.36
Yeah, I want you miss fits.

1437
01:15:03.36 --> 01:15:07.96
So the revely formations, that's like an official wake up performance.

1438
01:15:07.96 --> 01:15:13.04
Hey, wake up a six, we're meeting at 630, that's happened every day.

1439
01:15:13.04 --> 01:15:15.76
And then the end of the day, here's what we're doing.

1440
01:15:15.76 --> 01:15:19.60
You know, we're assembling again, we're putting out final word and then you can go and

1441
01:15:19.60 --> 01:15:20.76
have dinner or whatever.

1442
01:15:20.76 --> 01:15:21.76
Huh, okay.

1443
01:15:21.76 --> 01:15:30.80
So just really highly disciplined formalities, even when you just waking up, that's a procedure.

1444
01:15:30.80 --> 01:15:34.80
We're keeping it real across the board.

1445
01:15:34.80 --> 01:15:39.52
Continuing on in the third army when troops are not in the actual combat zone, nor engaged

1446
01:15:39.52 --> 01:15:44.52
in tactical exercises or range firing, core and separate divisions.

1447
01:15:44.52 --> 01:15:49.04
Separate division commanders will see, hey, that regular revely formations be held in

1448
01:15:49.04 --> 01:15:54.32
attendance at which there will be a minimum of one officer per company or similar unit.

1449
01:15:54.32 --> 01:15:59.92
And in addition, when practicable, a minimum of one field officer per regiment or separate

1450
01:15:59.92 --> 01:16:06.40
battalion, B, then it shall be customary for all organizations to hold formal retreat under

1451
01:16:06.40 --> 01:16:11.56
arms, attendance in addition to the prescribed and listed men shall be all officers of

1452
01:16:11.56 --> 01:16:13.68
company grade.

1453
01:16:13.68 --> 01:16:18.36
In the case of regiments and separate battalions of minimum of one field officer, B, that

1454
01:16:18.36 --> 01:16:24.92
in the case where music is available and it is practicable from a building standpoint,

1455
01:16:24.92 --> 01:16:31.56
frequent regimental and battalion retreat parades and similar ceremonies will be held.

1456
01:16:31.56 --> 01:16:36.36
Again, this is stuff that in the Seal teams, this never happens.

1457
01:16:36.36 --> 01:16:41.000
I mean, it happens like when someone retires, or when there's a funeral, like it does

1458
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:48.28
not happen where you could go, you could go, you could go years with

1459
01:16:48.28 --> 01:16:50.28
that ever putting on a dress uniform.

1460
01:16:50.28 --> 01:16:57.32
You could go years, so just kind of saying that unit and organizational guards shall be

1461
01:16:57.32 --> 01:17:03.40
performed strictly within accordance to FM 26, 5 when music is available, formal guard mounts

1462
01:17:03.40 --> 01:17:06.04
will be held frequently.

1463
01:17:06.04 --> 01:17:13.88
E that officers in formation where uniform, a nagleist to that worn by the enlisted men and

1464
01:17:13.88 --> 01:17:18.68
that all officers participate in all drills and marches at all times with their organizations

1465
01:17:18.68 --> 01:17:19.68
or units.

1466
01:17:19.68 --> 01:17:24.52
This includes marching, two and from training areas and ranges.

1467
01:17:24.52 --> 01:17:26.96
So that's the end of that list.

1468
01:17:26.96 --> 01:17:29.80
So you can say, he ain't playing around.

1469
01:17:29.80 --> 01:17:36.04
Back year going to be highly disciplined part of this situation here.

1470
01:17:36.04 --> 01:17:41.88
So in life, you know, because there's like format, you know, like dinner time for example,

1471
01:17:41.88 --> 01:17:42.88
that's like another.

1472
01:17:42.88 --> 01:17:46.88
I mean, that's not another by like a, well, I think that's not a life format.

1473
01:17:46.88 --> 01:17:48.88
Formality can hate.

1474
01:17:48.88 --> 01:17:52.64
Hey, fam, dinner time wash hands every day.

1475
01:17:52.64 --> 01:17:56.64
Six o'clock, 55 wash hands, six o'clock at the table.

1476
01:17:56.64 --> 01:17:58.08
You own before dinner.

1477
01:17:58.08 --> 01:17:59.84
Be home before dinner, all those things.

1478
01:17:59.84 --> 01:18:03.28
There's like things that you could put your life or, you know, wake up when your

1479
01:18:03.28 --> 01:18:04.96
alarm clock goes off, get your workout.

1480
01:18:04.96 --> 01:18:06.80
Like there's things you do every day, right?

1481
01:18:06.80 --> 01:18:09.44
Brush your teeth, flush your teeth, stupid, right?

1482
01:18:09.44 --> 01:18:13.12
Until you got your teeth falling out until you got dental problems.

1483
01:18:13.12 --> 01:18:14.12
Dental.

1484
01:18:14.12 --> 01:18:15.12
There he is.

1485
01:18:15.12 --> 01:18:18.88
Bed time to your, well, the dinner time is a big one because it's like everyone does it.

1486
01:18:18.88 --> 01:18:20.56
There's a procedure that's in place.

1487
01:18:20.56 --> 01:18:21.56
Hey, wash hands.

1488
01:18:21.56 --> 01:18:25.72
Sometimes they have one kid set the table or whatever, maybe two kids, whatever.

1489
01:18:25.72 --> 01:18:27.68
Then you can't just roll out.

1490
01:18:27.68 --> 01:18:28.68
You gotta what?

1491
01:18:28.68 --> 01:18:29.68
My bad.

1492
01:18:29.68 --> 01:18:30.68
You excuse.

1493
01:18:30.68 --> 01:18:33.56
And then it's like, okay, then, you know, then clean up time or whatever.

1494
01:18:33.56 --> 01:18:35.28
However, you handle that this different ways or whatever.

1495
01:18:35.28 --> 01:18:38.28
And then you're sort of done, you know, and it's everybody's a part of that.

1496
01:18:38.28 --> 01:18:42.72
Yeah, that's what, that's a little minor example of this.

1497
01:18:42.72 --> 01:18:43.72
Yeah.

1498
01:18:43.72 --> 01:18:45.56
And I think it's a good time to it, yeah.

1499
01:18:45.56 --> 01:18:46.56
Thanks.

1500
01:18:46.56 --> 01:18:47.56
Continue's on here.

1501
01:18:47.56 --> 01:18:50.80
Officers are always on duty.

1502
01:18:50.80 --> 01:18:56.48
And their duty extends to every individual junior to themselves in the US Army, not only

1503
01:18:56.48 --> 01:18:59.16
to members of the localization, that's awesome.

1504
01:18:59.16 --> 01:19:02.64
And this, you want to talk about, like, this is a good way to think about life as a human

1505
01:19:02.64 --> 01:19:04.92
big, right?

1506
01:19:04.92 --> 01:19:07.24
Like your duty extends to every human.

1507
01:19:07.24 --> 01:19:10.92
But I'm here to help other people.

1508
01:19:10.92 --> 01:19:13.80
Not just people that I know, but everybody.

1509
01:19:13.80 --> 01:19:20.84
Next Americans with arms in their hands are fools as well as cowards to surrender.

1510
01:19:20.84 --> 01:19:24.64
If they fight on, they will conquer.

1511
01:19:24.64 --> 01:19:29.36
He says this, cases of misbehavior before the enemy will be brought to before general

1512
01:19:29.36 --> 01:19:32.84
court martial and tried under the 75th article of war.

1513
01:19:32.84 --> 01:19:37.80
It has been my experience that many court marshals are prone to view this most heinous

1514
01:19:37.80 --> 01:19:45.08
offense for which the punishment of death may be inflicted in two lenient a manner.

1515
01:19:45.08 --> 01:19:49.84
They should realize that the lives of troops are saved by punishment of initial offenders.

1516
01:19:49.84 --> 01:19:56.64
Cowardous is a disease and it must be checked before it becomes an epidemic.

1517
01:19:56.64 --> 01:19:58.12
That sounds super hard, court.

1518
01:19:58.12 --> 01:20:01.08
I'm going to tell you a quick story.

1519
01:20:01.08 --> 01:20:03.68
I was, I don't even, were you?

1520
01:20:03.68 --> 01:20:09.92
No, it was Andy and I were training the other day and we were training on the, like

1521
01:20:09.92 --> 01:20:10.92
the Jockel map, right?

1522
01:20:10.92 --> 01:20:14.72
So we're training on the Jockel map and actually as we showed up, someone else was showing

1523
01:20:14.72 --> 01:20:19.32
up the train too and it was two adult males.

1524
01:20:19.32 --> 01:20:24.68
They had 14 year old kid with them estimated age.

1525
01:20:24.68 --> 01:20:27.44
And you know, I know the dad's a little bit, you know, I was, hey, what's going on?

1526
01:20:27.44 --> 01:20:32.20
I bring my friend, oh, they have their son, or he's got his son here, he trained a little

1527
01:20:32.20 --> 01:20:33.20
bit here there.

1528
01:20:33.20 --> 01:20:34.20
I'm like, okay, we see.

1529
01:20:34.20 --> 01:20:36.28
He's not sure about getting back into, I guess he's probably trained when he was, let's

1530
01:20:36.28 --> 01:20:37.28
say eight, right?

1531
01:20:37.28 --> 01:20:39.08
So it's been a few years.

1532
01:20:39.08 --> 01:20:45.20
And the kid, so the kid, so, and he, I look over the balcony thing and I see the kid

1533
01:20:45.20 --> 01:20:47.68
I goes at him and he's like, yeah, he's allowed in.

1534
01:20:47.68 --> 01:20:50.20
I go, yeah, I go, hey, send that kid up here so the kid comes up.

1535
01:20:50.20 --> 01:20:53.48
And I'm just like hanging out, having fun, whatever.

1536
01:20:53.48 --> 01:21:00.08
So then the kid shows up and getting warmed up with Andy and we'll take, you know,

1537
01:21:00.08 --> 01:21:03.36
five minutes, warm up round and I say the kid, I'm like, oh, hey, you know, you trained

1538
01:21:03.36 --> 01:21:04.36
before?

1539
01:21:04.36 --> 01:21:08.16
And he says, yeah, I trained a little bit and I was like, okay, cool, you know, that's awesome.

1540
01:21:08.16 --> 01:21:11.48
And then I do a couple rounds with Andy and then I say, and the meanwhile, the two dads

1541
01:21:11.48 --> 01:21:13.48
are training with G.

1542
01:21:13.48 --> 01:21:17.20
By the way, this is a long story.

1543
01:21:17.20 --> 01:21:20.04
I'm sorry, to, I'll make it as soon as possible.

1544
01:21:20.04 --> 01:21:24.08
Eventually, I say to the kid, hey, are you going to train?

1545
01:21:24.08 --> 01:21:27.68
And he goes, well, I'm not sure I'm allowed to.

1546
01:21:27.68 --> 01:21:31.08
And I said, no, no, actually, I own the gym.

1547
01:21:31.08 --> 01:21:33.48
So that means you can go, yeah, I'm telling you right now, you can go training, so come

1548
01:21:33.48 --> 01:21:34.48
out on the map.

1549
01:21:34.48 --> 01:21:37.52
Because I'm thinking there's a kid here that could change his life and have a better life

1550
01:21:37.52 --> 01:21:40.08
and they say, oh, world won't prove if he trains to jitter.

1551
01:21:40.08 --> 01:21:41.08
He's in the gym, bro.

1552
01:21:41.08 --> 01:21:42.76
I mean, this is like a low hanging fruit.

1553
01:21:42.76 --> 01:21:44.96
Let's get this kid in the game.

1554
01:21:44.96 --> 01:21:49.16
So then he says, I don't have a geek.

1555
01:21:49.16 --> 01:21:53.96
The other, the dad, not his dad, the other guy, the friend of his dad was like, I have one

1556
01:21:53.96 --> 01:21:54.96
for you.

1557
01:21:54.96 --> 01:21:57.92
And I go, go get it.

1558
01:21:57.92 --> 01:22:00.32
So then he runs out, goes get the geek in the car.

1559
01:22:00.32 --> 01:22:02.84
The kid kind of puts the g on, comes out of the map.

1560
01:22:02.84 --> 01:22:07.48
You can see the kids not, not really 100% down with this whole thing, right?

1561
01:22:07.48 --> 01:22:08.88
For whatever reason, right?

1562
01:22:08.88 --> 01:22:13.84
Maybe it's because it's weird to be with your dad and his old man friend, right?

1563
01:22:13.84 --> 01:22:14.84
Like sure.

1564
01:22:14.84 --> 01:22:18.04
I'm a 14 year old kid when we hang out with these old guys, don't we?

1565
01:22:18.04 --> 01:22:25.72
This weird thing is, here's the apex of the story that I've been trying to get to.

1566
01:22:25.72 --> 01:22:28.44
Eventually, the kids on the map, he's in his key.

1567
01:22:28.44 --> 01:22:31.88
I'm training with Andy, we're on a break during rounds.

1568
01:22:31.88 --> 01:22:35.04
And I hear the kid, it's a veteran of break, too, because they're doing 500 rounds, but it's

1569
01:22:35.04 --> 01:22:36.24
just the two dads.

1570
01:22:36.24 --> 01:22:45.48
And I hear them trying to convince the kid to get around with his dad was the beginner.

1571
01:22:45.48 --> 01:22:51.20
The other guy is maybe high level white belt, maybe like Boobell type level.

1572
01:22:51.20 --> 01:22:54.000
So he's kind of showing them what to do.

1573
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.44
And they're kind of trying to convince the kid, but the kid's kind of like, well, you know,

1574
01:22:59.44 --> 01:23:06.68
and so I look over there and I go, hey, you get on him right now, you're doing the next

1575
01:23:06.68 --> 01:23:09.28
round and the kid just goes and starts the round.

1576
01:23:09.28 --> 01:23:11.28
Get on, get on, I go ahead.

1577
01:23:11.28 --> 01:23:12.28
You're in.

1578
01:23:12.28 --> 01:23:14.20
I go, you go against him now.

1579
01:23:14.20 --> 01:23:18.28
And the kid like, just obeyed, right?

1580
01:23:18.28 --> 01:23:26.08
My point in saying this whole thing is like sometimes that kind of leadership is required.

1581
01:23:26.08 --> 01:23:29.56
Because all you're trying to do is push the kid in the right direction, push the

1582
01:23:29.56 --> 01:23:32.36
soldier in the right direction, push the employee in the right direction.

1583
01:23:32.36 --> 01:23:34.36
Hey, get up there on that thing.

1584
01:23:34.36 --> 01:23:35.96
Hey, just make that phone call.

1585
01:23:35.96 --> 01:23:38.44
Hey, just go confront that guy.

1586
01:23:38.44 --> 01:23:41.68
You know, like sometimes people need a little push.

1587
01:23:41.68 --> 01:23:44.16
That's all this kid needed was just a little push.

1588
01:23:44.16 --> 01:23:46.80
And they wasn't looking at me like going to say, no, I don't want to.

1589
01:23:46.80 --> 01:23:50.24
And if you would, you know, who knows, I would have dealt with the scenario, hopefully,

1590
01:23:50.24 --> 01:23:51.80
I will be said would have tried to.

1591
01:23:51.80 --> 01:23:54.24
But sometimes people just need a little push.

1592
01:23:54.24 --> 01:24:01.52
So this idea and that's the whole opening speech from Patton.

1593
01:24:01.52 --> 01:24:03.28
Say what you want about it.

1594
01:24:03.28 --> 01:24:08.24
Here's the standard Americans love winners.

1595
01:24:08.24 --> 01:24:10.04
Americans hate cowards.

1596
01:24:10.04 --> 01:24:14.92
Like that's a, that's a game mentality that you can start.

1597
01:24:14.92 --> 01:24:17.000
You can start it in a company, you can start a business.

1598
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.80
We don't, you know, we don't settle down.

1599
01:24:19.80 --> 01:24:20.80
We don't settle for that.

1600
01:24:20.80 --> 01:24:24.64
You know, like whatever it's going to be, you call that out.

1601
01:24:24.64 --> 01:24:28.36
And that becomes a part of your culture, right?

1602
01:24:28.36 --> 01:24:32.96
So sometimes when he's talking about this cowardice thing, I mean, you hear it all the

1603
01:24:32.96 --> 01:24:33.96
time, right?

1604
01:24:33.96 --> 01:24:36.56
You hear it, well, you hear it in an organization.

1605
01:24:36.56 --> 01:24:39.32
You know, you let a little bit of slack.

1606
01:24:39.32 --> 01:24:40.32
A little bit of slack here.

1607
01:24:40.32 --> 01:24:47.64
That's why when hack worth makes the call of, you know, you say to the, the, the, the

1608
01:24:47.64 --> 01:24:54.40
enlisted guy say to the officer hardcore recondo, the officer say back, no fucking slack.

1609
01:24:54.40 --> 01:24:58.28
That starts to become the mentality, even though, and hack worth even says it in the beginning,

1610
01:24:58.28 --> 01:25:01.64
people are like, oh, who's this gung-hung, Mr. gung-hung.

1611
01:25:01.64 --> 01:25:07.000
It's like, no, that starts to become the standard.

1612
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.40
You have to start somewhere.

1613
01:25:09.40 --> 01:25:12.80
So these are methods of leadership.

1614
01:25:12.80 --> 01:25:14.68
The pro, can people go overboard to stuff?

1615
01:25:14.68 --> 01:25:15.68
Of course they can.

1616
01:25:15.68 --> 01:25:16.68
Totally.

1617
01:25:16.68 --> 01:25:18.88
That's why there's a lot of leadership that has to be balanced.

1618
01:25:18.88 --> 01:25:24.72
And there's so many times where Patton, again, kind of like we'd see with Chestie Polar,

1619
01:25:24.72 --> 01:25:35.96
like Chestie Polar, this big, you know, bombastic figure of courage and bravery and being

1620
01:25:35.96 --> 01:25:37.96
super hardcore, hard-nosed.

1621
01:25:37.96 --> 01:25:42.04
You know, when you read that book about him, man, he loved though.

1622
01:25:42.04 --> 01:25:43.40
He loved this guy's.

1623
01:25:43.40 --> 01:25:44.40
Hail, man.

1624
01:25:44.40 --> 01:25:45.40
You might not want to do that.

1625
01:25:45.40 --> 01:25:48.04
Remember that, like, where was the way he would talk to his guys?

1626
01:25:48.04 --> 01:25:49.04
Yeah.

1627
01:25:49.04 --> 01:25:55.32
And yet he was super hardcore Patton same thing.

1628
01:25:55.32 --> 01:26:01.48
So he's saying, look, when you get cowardice, yes, you, you, you nip it in the butt.

1629
01:26:01.48 --> 01:26:03.60
Get someone acting up, you go, hey, we don't act like that.

1630
01:26:03.60 --> 01:26:08.68
It's on because, oh, good.

1631
01:26:08.68 --> 01:26:16.96
Next section is tactical, you suggest, these are good combat principles.

1632
01:26:16.96 --> 01:26:21.84
There is no approved solution to any tactical situation, boom.

1633
01:26:21.84 --> 01:26:26.28
There is no approved solution to any tactical situation.

1634
01:26:26.28 --> 01:26:30.80
There is only one tactical principle, which is not subject to change.

1635
01:26:30.80 --> 01:26:37.24
It is to so use the means at hand to inflict the maximum amount of wounds, death and destruction

1636
01:26:37.24 --> 01:26:40.20
on the enemy in the minimum amount of time.

1637
01:26:40.20 --> 01:26:43.52
That's what doesn't change.

1638
01:26:43.52 --> 01:26:49.04
To so use the means at hand to inflict the maximum amount of wounds, death and destruction

1639
01:26:49.04 --> 01:26:53.04
on the enemy in the minimum amount of time.

1640
01:26:53.04 --> 01:26:54.04
That's not going to change.

1641
01:26:54.04 --> 01:26:55.52
We're holding fast bat one.

1642
01:26:55.52 --> 01:26:59.44
Next in battle casualties vary directly with the time you were exposed to effective

1643
01:26:59.44 --> 01:27:00.44
fire.

1644
01:27:00.44 --> 01:27:05.68
Your own fire reduces the effectiveness and volume of the enemy fire while rapidity of

1645
01:27:05.68 --> 01:27:08.32
attack shortens the time of exposure.

1646
01:27:08.32 --> 01:27:10.20
A pint of sweat will save a gallon of blood.

1647
01:27:10.20 --> 01:27:11.56
That's cover move by the way.

1648
01:27:11.56 --> 01:27:13.96
Obviously, we're going to put down fire while we move.

1649
01:27:13.96 --> 01:27:15.60
That's cover move.

1650
01:27:15.60 --> 01:27:17.64
Battles are won by fighting the enemy.

1651
01:27:17.64 --> 01:27:21.20
Fear is induced by inflicting death and wounds on him.

1652
01:27:21.20 --> 01:27:23.12
Death and wounds are produced by fire.

1653
01:27:23.12 --> 01:27:27.76
Fire from the rear is more deadly and three times more effective from fire than fire from

1654
01:27:27.76 --> 01:27:28.76
the front.

1655
01:27:28.76 --> 01:27:34.32
To get fire behind the enemy, you must hold him by frontal fire and move rapidly around

1656
01:27:34.32 --> 01:27:35.72
his flank.

1657
01:27:35.72 --> 01:27:40.60
Frontal attacks against prepared positions should be avoided as possible.

1658
01:27:40.60 --> 01:27:45.88
Cover move and don't attack directly using direct attacks.

1659
01:27:45.88 --> 01:27:47.68
Thank you.

1660
01:27:47.68 --> 01:27:51.80
Thank you, General Patton.

1661
01:27:51.80 --> 01:27:55.96
Catch the enemy by the nose with fire and kick him in the pants with fire in place

1662
01:27:55.96 --> 01:27:57.96
through movement.

1663
01:27:57.96 --> 01:28:00.64
Cover move.

1664
01:28:00.64 --> 01:28:02.36
Hit hard soon.

1665
01:28:02.36 --> 01:28:07.32
That is with two battalions up in a regiment or two divisions up in a corps or two corps

1666
01:28:07.32 --> 01:28:10.20
up in an army.

1667
01:28:10.20 --> 01:28:13.92
The idea being to develop your maximum force at once before the enemy can develop

1668
01:28:13.92 --> 01:28:17.92
his as part of which I was next to you by the way.

1669
01:28:17.92 --> 01:28:19.32
Focus your attacks.

1670
01:28:19.32 --> 01:28:20.44
You can never be too strong.

1671
01:28:20.44 --> 01:28:26.16
Get every man and every gun you can secure provided it does not unduly delay your attack.

1672
01:28:26.16 --> 01:28:29.28
The German is a champion digger.

1673
01:28:29.28 --> 01:28:33.76
The larger the force and the more violence you use in your attack, whether it be men, tanks,

1674
01:28:33.76 --> 01:28:37.76
ammunition, the smaller your proportional losses.

1675
01:28:37.76 --> 01:28:39.16
This is a tough one.

1676
01:28:39.16 --> 01:28:44.28
This is the one that you, you can get caught thinking that, oh, what going to do this

1677
01:28:44.28 --> 01:28:47.000
big attack that there's going to be casualties.

1678
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.24
It's like there's going to be less casualties if you do it with the biggest at force

1679
01:28:51.24 --> 01:28:57.92
you can and the most of violence you can possibly do your attack with.

1680
01:28:57.92 --> 01:28:59.52
Never yield ground.

1681
01:28:59.52 --> 01:29:04.08
It is cheaper to hold what you have than retake what you have lost.

1682
01:29:04.08 --> 01:29:09.20
Never move troops to the rear for arrest or to reform at night and in the daytime

1683
01:29:09.20 --> 01:29:11.64
only were absolutely necessary.

1684
01:29:11.64 --> 01:29:18.52
Such moves may produce a panic.

1685
01:29:18.52 --> 01:29:24.12
There's tactical rules in particular subjects.

1686
01:29:24.12 --> 01:29:27.84
Use roads to march on fields to fight and troops should not deploy until they're forced

1687
01:29:27.84 --> 01:29:29.28
by the enemy fire.

1688
01:29:29.28 --> 01:29:34.04
When you are advancing in broken country against possible tank attacks and using leap

1689
01:29:34.04 --> 01:29:39.40
and using leap frog method be sure to keep the anti guns up as well.

1690
01:29:39.40 --> 01:29:41.76
leap frog, what you know that is?

1691
01:29:41.76 --> 01:29:42.76
It's for the men.

1692
01:29:42.76 --> 01:29:44.64
I know what the game leap frog is.

1693
01:29:44.64 --> 01:29:47.20
Yes, but it's also cover move.

1694
01:29:47.20 --> 01:29:52.24
Because I hold position you leap forward once you get there you hold position meaning

1695
01:29:52.24 --> 01:29:55.96
you either fire or you prepare to fire if you have to and then I move.

1696
01:29:55.96 --> 01:30:00.16
So it's called a leap frog.

1697
01:30:00.16 --> 01:30:03.28
In mountain country secure the heights.

1698
01:30:03.28 --> 01:30:08.04
Enforcing a past secure the heights first.

1699
01:30:08.04 --> 01:30:09.04
This is an interesting one.

1700
01:30:09.04 --> 01:30:12.16
The effects of mines is largely mental.

1701
01:30:12.16 --> 01:30:18.28
On over 10% of our casualties come from them.

1702
01:30:18.28 --> 01:30:23.36
Interesting about that is it's lower to the mental because you have fear of this thing

1703
01:30:23.36 --> 01:30:32.000
that you can't see but he's saying not 10% of our casualties come from them but for my generation

1704
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.32
it's like 70% of casualties are from IEDs.

1705
01:30:37.32 --> 01:30:40.96
So a little different than just mental.

1706
01:30:40.96 --> 01:30:47.04
Never permitted unit to dig in until the final objective is reached then dig in wire and

1707
01:30:47.04 --> 01:30:48.68
mine.

1708
01:30:48.68 --> 01:30:50.96
Take plenty of time to set up an attack.

1709
01:30:50.96 --> 01:30:52.92
Takes at least this is here's why I put it.

1710
01:30:52.92 --> 01:30:57.08
It takes at least two hours to prepare an infantry battalion to execute a properly coordinated

1711
01:30:57.08 --> 01:30:58.08
attack.

1712
01:30:58.08 --> 01:31:00.52
Shoveing them into soon produces useless.

1713
01:31:00.52 --> 01:31:09.76
What's funny about this is nowadays we will take two weeks to prepare for an attack.

1714
01:31:09.76 --> 01:31:13.88
So he's saying look hey you need two hours.

1715
01:31:13.88 --> 01:31:16.000
The thing is he's right.

1716
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.92
If everybody knows their jobs you put together a simple clear plan that's flexible you

1717
01:31:20.92 --> 01:31:25.28
don't need all this time.

1718
01:31:25.28 --> 01:31:30.92
In battle small forces, platoon companies and even battions can do one of three things

1719
01:31:30.92 --> 01:31:34.40
go forward, halt or run.

1720
01:31:34.40 --> 01:31:36.20
Think about life.

1721
01:31:36.20 --> 01:31:41.68
Think about what you can do in life. You can go forward, halt or run.

1722
01:31:41.68 --> 01:31:43.16
What else is there?

1723
01:31:43.16 --> 01:31:44.52
Go forward, halt or run.

1724
01:31:44.52 --> 01:31:45.52
He continues.

1725
01:31:45.52 --> 01:31:48.88
If they halt or run they will be an even easier target.

1726
01:31:48.88 --> 01:31:51.16
Therefore they must go forward.

1727
01:31:51.16 --> 01:31:57.44
When caught under fire particularly of artillery advanced out of it never retreat from it.

1728
01:31:57.44 --> 01:32:01.32
Artillery very seldom shortens its range.

1729
01:32:01.32 --> 01:32:07.20
So think about that how often are we in a position where we can go forward we can halt

1730
01:32:07.20 --> 01:32:08.20
or we can run.

1731
01:32:08.20 --> 01:32:17.40
What do you say is you're getting attacked instead of going backwards go forwards.

1732
01:32:17.40 --> 01:32:19.68
General training.

1733
01:32:19.68 --> 01:32:24.04
Again skipping a bunch of sections but general training more emphasis will be placed on

1734
01:32:24.04 --> 01:32:28.56
the hardening of men and officers.

1735
01:32:28.56 --> 01:32:32.36
This soldiers and officers should be able to run a mile with combat, pack and ten minutes

1736
01:32:32.36 --> 01:32:36.000
and march eight miles and two hours.

1737
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.16
When soldiers are an actual contact with the enemy it is almost impossible to maintain

1738
01:32:40.16 --> 01:32:41.40
physical condition.

1739
01:32:41.40 --> 01:32:45.16
But if the physical condition is right before they gain contact it will not fall off sufficiently

1740
01:32:45.16 --> 01:32:51.72
during contact to be detrimental.

1741
01:32:51.72 --> 01:32:53.92
Hardening of men and officers.

1742
01:32:53.92 --> 01:32:56.12
That's just that's what we're doing.

1743
01:32:56.12 --> 01:32:57.12
Just hardening.

1744
01:32:57.12 --> 01:32:59.76
Doesn't some very comfortable by the way.

1745
01:32:59.76 --> 01:33:03.36
It is not meant to be.

1746
01:33:03.36 --> 01:33:07.64
Our ability to fight at night as opposed to moving to position at night for a dawn attack

1747
01:33:07.64 --> 01:33:09.28
is pitably bad.

1748
01:33:09.28 --> 01:33:13.64
We must learn to execute the attack in the dark.

1749
01:33:13.64 --> 01:33:15.68
This might be one of my favorites.

1750
01:33:15.68 --> 01:33:25.08
Sharpening axes, pick axes and shovels now and keep them sharp.

1751
01:33:25.08 --> 01:33:27.04
Just think about that.

1752
01:33:27.04 --> 01:33:31.16
Sharpening your shovels.

1753
01:33:31.16 --> 01:33:32.64
I've never sharpened a shovel in my life.

1754
01:33:32.64 --> 01:33:37.000
I'm going to go home today and sharpen my shovels.

1755
01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.72
You know what I was saying?

1756
01:33:38.72 --> 01:33:39.72
Sharpening your shovels.

1757
01:33:39.72 --> 01:33:41.96
That's a mindset.

1758
01:33:41.96 --> 01:33:43.20
Never mind sharpen your sword.

1759
01:33:43.20 --> 01:33:44.32
Look, your sword better be sharp.

1760
01:33:44.32 --> 01:33:46.56
I'm going to sharpen my damn shovel.

1761
01:33:46.56 --> 01:33:49.20
In the event of.

1762
01:33:49.20 --> 01:33:51.48
Get ready, be ready.

1763
01:33:51.48 --> 01:33:52.48
Stay ready.

1764
01:33:52.48 --> 01:33:53.48
Stay ready.

1765
01:33:53.48 --> 01:33:57.000
I might have to hit you in the head with a pick axe and I want to go clean.

1766
01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000
And through.

1767
01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Or dig a hole real quick.

1768
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.20
Or dig a hole either way.

1769
01:34:00.20 --> 01:34:02.000
I'm going to be ready.

1770
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Yeah.

1771
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.92
Battles are fought by Patuens and squads.

1772
01:34:04.92 --> 01:34:08.48
Place empson on small unit combat instructions so that it's conducted with the same

1773
01:34:08.48 --> 01:34:10.56
precision as close order drill.

1774
01:34:10.56 --> 01:34:14.28
A good solution applied with vigor now is better than a perfect solution ten minutes

1775
01:34:14.28 --> 01:34:17.08
later.

1776
01:34:17.08 --> 01:34:21.80
Instruction from the squad to the regiment's sand table should be used and the officer

1777
01:34:21.80 --> 01:34:26.96
or non-combing instructed should give the actual orders he will give in common.

1778
01:34:26.96 --> 01:34:32.40
Sandtables need not be complicated a piece of ground in the leave of a building is just

1779
01:34:32.40 --> 01:34:34.64
good and much simpler.

1780
01:34:34.64 --> 01:34:41.68
I used to have this little kit I learned this from one of the Australian SAS guys that

1781
01:34:41.68 --> 01:34:43.96
was stationed with us over at Sulteen one.

1782
01:34:43.96 --> 01:34:46.32
Perfectly doing.

1783
01:34:46.32 --> 01:34:49.04
And as you know, it's a Cretz box is.

1784
01:34:49.04 --> 01:34:50.04
Suit Cretz.

1785
01:34:50.04 --> 01:34:52.04
Cretz I think it's called breathments.

1786
01:34:52.04 --> 01:34:53.04
Yeah.

1787
01:34:53.04 --> 01:34:54.04
It's like a little tin box.

1788
01:34:54.04 --> 01:35:02.80
Yeah. So in this little tin box, you could open it up and I had little little like

1789
01:35:02.80 --> 01:35:12.96
little wood, little wood things, little wood placards and they had each little wood placard

1790
01:35:12.96 --> 01:35:15.04
was shaped kind of like a tear drop.

1791
01:35:15.04 --> 01:35:16.04
Okay.

1792
01:35:16.04 --> 01:35:22.08
So it's a picture of tear drop and then on the tear drop it said PT was the first one.

1793
01:35:22.08 --> 01:35:24.92
And the next one said PL the next one said RTO.

1794
01:35:24.92 --> 01:35:28.12
So this point man, puttoon leader, radio man.

1795
01:35:28.12 --> 01:35:32.60
And so I had one of these little tear drops for each guy in the puttoon.

1796
01:35:32.60 --> 01:35:37.80
And then I had like a few pieces of ribbon in there.

1797
01:35:37.80 --> 01:35:41.08
And the ribbon is used to go, oh here's a road, here's a stream.

1798
01:35:41.08 --> 01:35:42.08
Okay.

1799
01:35:42.08 --> 01:35:43.08
Here's a fence.

1800
01:35:43.08 --> 01:35:46.68
So what you could do is you could sit down in a perimeter and you could make a little

1801
01:35:46.68 --> 01:35:47.68
sand table.

1802
01:35:47.68 --> 01:35:48.68
What's what a sand table is.

1803
01:35:48.68 --> 01:35:49.68
That's what you talk about.

1804
01:35:49.68 --> 01:35:51.44
It's like a little diagram of what's happening.

1805
01:35:51.44 --> 01:35:58.44
So I had a couple like a little tiny house like a monopoly.

1806
01:35:58.44 --> 01:36:00.16
Like a monopoly house.

1807
01:36:00.16 --> 01:36:04.20
So you could do like a building here and there's a building here where to move in here.

1808
01:36:04.20 --> 01:36:05.20
That's what I had.

1809
01:36:05.20 --> 01:36:07.04
And so you'd be able to break this thing out.

1810
01:36:07.04 --> 01:36:09.04
You'd see like a real pro.

1811
01:36:09.04 --> 01:36:15.88
So the little, well, so we don't even know what a placard technically is.

1812
01:36:15.88 --> 01:36:18.32
But you described it pretty good.

1813
01:36:18.32 --> 01:36:21.32
It's just a small tear drop representative of the person.

1814
01:36:21.32 --> 01:36:25.28
The reason you have a tear drop, there's not a tear drop is because then whatever

1815
01:36:25.28 --> 01:36:28.32
point, the tear, the thing was pointing out.

1816
01:36:28.32 --> 01:36:29.32
That's the way weapons was face.

1817
01:36:29.32 --> 01:36:30.32
Okay.

1818
01:36:30.32 --> 01:36:31.32
Yeah.

1819
01:36:31.32 --> 01:36:32.32
Good.

1820
01:36:32.32 --> 01:36:33.32
Bang in the monopoly house is.

1821
01:36:33.32 --> 01:36:34.32
Wait, was it a house or a condo?

1822
01:36:34.32 --> 01:36:35.32
Because it's different.

1823
01:36:35.32 --> 01:36:37.32
The house is a little green when the condo is a big red one.

1824
01:36:37.32 --> 01:36:39.32
Green looks a little bit more tactical.

1825
01:36:39.32 --> 01:36:41.52
And those were only because you couldn't actually show what you could show how you're

1826
01:36:41.52 --> 01:36:42.52
going to set.

1827
01:36:42.52 --> 01:36:43.52
That would be like the target.

1828
01:36:43.52 --> 01:36:45.32
So now we see how we're going to set up like targets here.

1829
01:36:45.32 --> 01:36:46.32
Boom.

1830
01:36:46.32 --> 01:36:47.32
You guys are going here.

1831
01:36:47.32 --> 01:36:48.32
Here's what we're going to maneuver.

1832
01:36:48.32 --> 01:36:51.28
And then because it's way, but it's just nice.

1833
01:36:51.28 --> 01:36:53.28
Imagine you're in the field.

1834
01:36:53.28 --> 01:36:55.28
And you got to draw in the dirt.

1835
01:36:55.28 --> 01:36:57.28
But you're finding rocks.

1836
01:36:57.28 --> 01:36:59.28
And you're like, no, this is you, RTO.

1837
01:36:59.28 --> 01:37:00.28
And he's like, which one is me?

1838
01:37:00.28 --> 01:37:01.28
Right.

1839
01:37:01.28 --> 01:37:02.28
All those problems are solved.

1840
01:37:02.28 --> 01:37:03.28
Yeah.

1841
01:37:03.28 --> 01:37:04.28
You got the secret box.

1842
01:37:04.28 --> 01:37:05.28
Show them what's up.

1843
01:37:05.28 --> 01:37:06.28
Yeah, man.

1844
01:37:06.28 --> 01:37:07.28
It's good.

1845
01:37:07.28 --> 01:37:08.28
Yeah, they do that on a line of movies.

1846
01:37:08.28 --> 01:37:09.28
For sure.

1847
01:37:09.28 --> 01:37:10.28
What?

1848
01:37:10.28 --> 01:37:11.28
The secret box?

1849
01:37:11.28 --> 01:37:12.28
No, not this particular one.

1850
01:37:12.28 --> 01:37:14.28
But it's created diagram of the plan.

1851
01:37:14.28 --> 01:37:15.28
And it's like a rock.

1852
01:37:15.28 --> 01:37:17.28
Sometimes a rock depends on the movie.

1853
01:37:17.28 --> 01:37:18.28
Obviously.

1854
01:37:18.28 --> 01:37:19.28
Like, I'm back to the future.

1855
01:37:19.28 --> 01:37:20.28
Yeah.

1856
01:37:20.28 --> 01:37:21.28
Brown, whatever.

1857
01:37:21.28 --> 01:37:25.28
He made the, this, he's like, please excuse the crew to mock up.

1858
01:37:25.28 --> 01:37:27.28
You know, I didn't have the time to get to scale in the team.

1859
01:37:27.28 --> 01:37:28.28
In the body.

1860
01:37:28.28 --> 01:37:31.28
We would go to like these briefings, battalion brief, briefings or brigade briefings.

1861
01:37:31.28 --> 01:37:34.28
They would have that massive sand tables.

1862
01:37:34.28 --> 01:37:35.28
You'd walk around on them.

1863
01:37:35.28 --> 01:37:36.28
Oh, okay.

1864
01:37:36.28 --> 01:37:38.28
Like all the roads were laid out.

1865
01:37:38.28 --> 01:37:41.28
You know, the road would be four inches wide.

1866
01:37:41.28 --> 01:37:43.28
Six inches wide.

1867
01:37:43.28 --> 01:37:45.28
And all the buildings built out of blocks.

1868
01:37:45.28 --> 01:37:46.28
Yeah.

1869
01:37:46.28 --> 01:37:47.28
I'll just two by four.

1870
01:37:47.28 --> 01:37:48.28
So he's some pride.

1871
01:37:48.28 --> 01:37:49.28
Some pride.

1872
01:37:49.28 --> 01:37:50.28
And some pride.

1873
01:37:50.28 --> 01:37:52.28
There's, because all that up two by four is glued together.

1874
01:37:52.28 --> 01:37:53.28
Ten a good little time.

1875
01:37:53.28 --> 01:37:59.28
But you get the thing is once again, in comparison to the thing that you just look out

1876
01:37:59.28 --> 01:38:04.28
on the power point, you start walking around that visual, actual model.

1877
01:38:04.28 --> 01:38:06.28
You get a better understanding of it.

1878
01:38:06.28 --> 01:38:07.28
Yeah.

1879
01:38:07.28 --> 01:38:08.28
Yeah.

1880
01:38:08.28 --> 01:38:09.28
Yeah.

1881
01:38:09.28 --> 01:38:12.28
So get yourself a little scrap box.

1882
01:38:12.28 --> 01:38:13.28
All to it.

1883
01:38:13.28 --> 01:38:14.28
It's like all to it's probably.

1884
01:38:14.28 --> 01:38:15.28
Probably.

1885
01:38:15.28 --> 01:38:17.28
Maybe I can make one.

1886
01:38:17.28 --> 01:38:19.28
And like show it to people.

1887
01:38:19.28 --> 01:38:20.28
I don't think I could find.

1888
01:38:20.28 --> 01:38:21.28
I used to have.

1889
01:38:21.28 --> 01:38:22.28
I can't find it anymore.

1890
01:38:22.28 --> 01:38:23.28
What?

1891
01:38:23.28 --> 01:38:24.28
The secret?

1892
01:38:24.28 --> 01:38:25.28
No.

1893
01:38:25.28 --> 01:38:26.28
The whole little kit that I used to have.

1894
01:38:26.28 --> 01:38:27.28
I might be able to find it.

1895
01:38:27.28 --> 01:38:28.28
You made that kit.

1896
01:38:28.28 --> 01:38:29.28
No.

1897
01:38:29.28 --> 01:38:30.28
Made it.

1898
01:38:30.28 --> 01:38:33.28
Maybe I need to make one that I could offer to people.

1899
01:38:33.28 --> 01:38:34.28
Sure.

1900
01:38:34.28 --> 01:38:35.28
Right.

1901
01:38:35.28 --> 01:38:37.28
I'm sure these people everywhere that are waiting.

1902
01:38:37.28 --> 01:38:38.28
They need to.

1903
01:38:38.28 --> 01:38:39.28
Sure.

1904
01:38:39.28 --> 01:38:41.28
Just randomly have or what?

1905
01:38:41.28 --> 01:38:42.28
Like.

1906
01:38:42.28 --> 01:38:43.28
Shoot.

1907
01:38:43.28 --> 01:38:44.28
All right.

1908
01:38:44.28 --> 01:38:45.28
Yeah.

1909
01:38:45.28 --> 01:38:46.28
I think that's the DIY situation.

1910
01:38:46.28 --> 01:38:46.28
Yeah.

1911
01:38:46.28 --> 01:38:48.28
I think they sell for not going to make them.

1912
01:38:48.28 --> 01:38:49.28
Decisions been made.

1913
01:38:49.28 --> 01:38:50.28
Yeah.

1914
01:38:50.28 --> 01:38:51.28
Kind of want to go.

1915
01:38:51.28 --> 01:38:52.28
It is cool.

1916
01:38:52.28 --> 01:38:54.28
Because that's kind of stuff you do when you're.

1917
01:38:54.28 --> 01:38:55.28
Like a little kid.

1918
01:38:55.28 --> 01:38:56.28
Let's face it.

1919
01:38:56.28 --> 01:39:01.28
That's what's awesome about being in the seal teams or in the military is like all the things that you did when you were a little kid.

1920
01:39:01.28 --> 01:39:03.28
You're actually doing for real and it's the best.

1921
01:39:03.28 --> 01:39:04.28
Yeah.

1922
01:39:04.28 --> 01:39:05.28
It's like real.

1923
01:39:05.28 --> 01:39:06.28
Yeah.

1924
01:39:06.28 --> 01:39:07.28
I'm like, oh, I'm really doing this.

1925
01:39:07.28 --> 01:39:08.28
Yeah.

1926
01:39:08.28 --> 01:39:09.28
I really did that.

1927
01:39:09.28 --> 01:39:10.28
Real mission.

1928
01:39:10.28 --> 01:39:11.28
You know, I really.

1929
01:39:11.28 --> 01:39:15.28
Like I really sat and briefed my guys on like killing people.

1930
01:39:15.28 --> 01:39:18.28
You know, it's you sit there and you think back.

1931
01:39:18.28 --> 01:39:19.28
Well, that's what I was doing.

1932
01:39:19.28 --> 01:39:20.28
Yeah.

1933
01:39:20.28 --> 01:39:21.28
Yeah.

1934
01:39:21.28 --> 01:39:22.28
I did that.

1935
01:39:22.28 --> 01:39:23.28
I gave that brief.

1936
01:39:23.28 --> 01:39:24.28
You know, it's like it's.

1937
01:39:24.28 --> 01:39:25.28
It's.

1938
01:39:25.28 --> 01:39:26.28
So lucky to be in.

1939
01:39:26.28 --> 01:39:28.28
To be in the situation.

1940
01:39:28.28 --> 01:39:30.28
Where you get to grow up and do what you wanted to do.

1941
01:39:30.28 --> 01:39:32.28
I didn't even grow up.

1942
01:39:32.28 --> 01:39:33.28
Yeah.

1943
01:39:33.28 --> 01:39:35.28
All right.

1944
01:39:35.28 --> 01:39:37.28
Guides.

1945
01:39:37.28 --> 01:39:39.28
Oh, officers and men must know their equipment.

1946
01:39:39.28 --> 01:39:40.28
They must train with the equipment.

1947
01:39:40.28 --> 01:39:44.28
They intend to use in battle equipment must be the best operational condition when taken in the theater of romp.

1948
01:39:44.28 --> 01:39:45.28
They've been theater romp operations.

1949
01:39:45.28 --> 01:39:46.28
Yeah.

1950
01:39:46.28 --> 01:39:48.28
You have to use what you're going to use.

1951
01:39:48.28 --> 01:39:50.28
You have to.

1952
01:39:50.28 --> 01:39:58.28
Guides for officers officers must possess self confidence and confidence of their men and the confidence of their men.

1953
01:39:58.28 --> 01:40:09.28
Two of the best ways of producing this is meticulously conducted close order drill conducted by officers and platoon marches of 48 to 60 hours during which the platoon is wholly on its own.

1954
01:40:09.28 --> 01:40:12.28
Check.

1955
01:40:12.28 --> 01:40:27.28
In the first actions, new troops must receive aggressive leadership by all grades, including general officers who must be seen in the front in the front line during action.

1956
01:40:27.28 --> 01:40:30.28
Check.

1957
01:40:30.28 --> 01:40:35.28
There is a universal failure to repeat back oral orders.

1958
01:40:35.28 --> 01:40:39.28
This failure is certain to result in grave errors.

1959
01:40:39.28 --> 01:40:44.28
Messages and orders must use concise military verbiage.

1960
01:40:44.28 --> 01:40:48.28
So, the second time he's hit on is make sure you start to think doesn't it?

1961
01:40:48.28 --> 01:40:50.28
Maybe he's onto something.

1962
01:40:50.28 --> 01:40:55.28
When you tell somebody to do something, have them tell it back to you.

1963
01:40:55.28 --> 01:41:01.28
Make it simple clear and concise.

1964
01:41:01.28 --> 01:41:06.28
Prisoners, German prisoners over 40 talk morties leave in the younger ones.

1965
01:41:06.28 --> 01:41:10.28
They must be examined separately and not returned to cages where the young ones are.

1966
01:41:10.28 --> 01:41:16.28
Prisoners and other Germans usually talk, well prisoners other than Germans usually talk freely and inaccurately.

1967
01:41:16.28 --> 01:41:21.28
They too should be examined out of hearing and later separated from the young Nazis.

1968
01:41:21.28 --> 01:41:22.28
Yeah, you can imagine.

1969
01:41:22.28 --> 01:41:30.28
I mean, just like we read in unit, it's not unit 731.

1970
01:41:30.28 --> 01:41:36.28
Or an airy man in a police pet time, but the older Nazis like they don't convince.

1971
01:41:36.28 --> 01:41:40.28
You can imagine when you capture them, then I gotta tell you what's going on.

1972
01:41:40.28 --> 01:41:46.28
You capture a young militant, you know, 15 year old Nazi Hitler youth.

1973
01:41:46.28 --> 01:41:47.28
He's not gonna say anything to you.

1974
01:41:47.28 --> 01:41:50.28
He's gonna say blood and honor, that's it.

1975
01:41:50.28 --> 01:41:54.28
There is a tendency for the Cheney Command to overload junior.

1976
01:41:54.28 --> 01:42:03.28
There is a tendency for the Cheney Command to overload junior officers with excessive requirements in the way of training and reports.

1977
01:42:03.28 --> 01:42:08.28
You will alleviate this burden by eliminating non-essential demands.

1978
01:42:08.28 --> 01:42:11.28
Boom, there you go.

1979
01:42:11.28 --> 01:42:13.28
Everybody should listen to that.

1980
01:42:13.28 --> 01:42:20.28
Part of it, you know how you get in situations where your basic attitude is it?

1981
01:42:20.28 --> 01:42:24.28
Well, it sucked for me. I had to go through it. Now I'm gonna make you go through it too.

1982
01:42:24.28 --> 01:42:32.28
Yeah, that's what I think some of this is because that's because people lose memory of what it was like.

1983
01:42:32.28 --> 01:42:36.28
And so they start, they just carry on a tradition.

1984
01:42:36.28 --> 01:42:39.28
Some of it's like, oh, I had to do those reports when I was new guy.

1985
01:42:39.28 --> 01:42:41.28
Now you're gonna do them too.

1986
01:42:41.28 --> 01:42:43.28
Yeah, I wonder, what do you think about that?

1987
01:42:43.28 --> 01:42:46.28
We're okay, I'm not kidding.

1988
01:42:46.28 --> 01:42:53.28
It's kind of too parts. There's the part where it's like, okay, there's some valuable things that a new guy has to go through.

1989
01:42:53.28 --> 01:42:56.28
That seem like a hazing or a wobble box.

1990
01:42:56.28 --> 01:42:58.28
But it actually serves the actual process.

1991
01:42:58.28 --> 01:42:59.28
Right?

1992
01:42:59.28 --> 01:43:01.28
And then there's that additional, like, oh, that's the tradition.

1993
01:43:01.28 --> 01:43:05.28
As a new guy, you gotta, I don't know, pay your dues for like a better turn.

1994
01:43:05.28 --> 01:43:08.28
Do you think there's value in that for like, there's some value.

1995
01:43:08.28 --> 01:43:10.28
There is definitely some value.

1996
01:43:10.28 --> 01:43:16.28
And also, you know, when, and late, when I talk about this all the time, when we got told to do paperwork and

1997
01:43:16.28 --> 01:43:20.28
late, and Seth didn't want to do paperwork, and they're like, do you jocco, can you put a stop and just

1998
01:43:20.28 --> 01:43:23.28
something like, no, actually, we're going to do the paperwork.

1999
01:43:23.28 --> 01:43:28.28
That doesn't mean that I said, oh, I like doing the paperwork, and I think it's beneficial.

2000
01:43:28.28 --> 01:43:30.28
No, I was trying to build a relationship with my boss.

2001
01:43:30.28 --> 01:43:37.28
As often as I could, especially overseas, I tried to eliminate as much paperwork as possible.

2002
01:43:37.28 --> 01:43:40.28
Well, it was no way successful, but I tried.

2003
01:43:40.28 --> 01:43:44.28
Yeah, and there is, and you, when I went to Officer Canada at school, there was all kinds of things that

2004
01:43:44.28 --> 01:43:47.28
seemed really dumb when you're there, especially I went there and I had been in the

2005
01:43:47.28 --> 01:43:50.28
Navy for eight years, so I kind of understood what was happening.

2006
01:43:50.28 --> 01:43:55.28
But those people that had just been in the Navy for 10 weeks when the drone structure finally

2007
01:43:55.28 --> 01:44:02.28
said, hey, this is, this is why we do this to you and everything kind of makes sense.

2008
01:44:02.28 --> 01:44:06.28
So there's definitely something, you know, not looking at your meal while you're reading it.

2009
01:44:06.28 --> 01:44:07.28
Right?

2010
01:44:07.28 --> 01:44:08.28
What does that do?

2011
01:44:08.28 --> 01:44:10.28
Develops your peripheral vision.

2012
01:44:10.28 --> 01:44:12.28
Yelling everything that you say, what does that do?

2013
01:44:12.28 --> 01:44:14.28
It allows you to speak with more confidence.

2014
01:44:14.28 --> 01:44:15.28
Yeah.

2015
01:44:15.28 --> 01:44:17.28
It makes you learn how to think before you speak.

2016
01:44:17.28 --> 01:44:20.28
Think about every time you talk, you have to yell at the top of your lungs.

2017
01:44:20.28 --> 01:44:22.28
That's what you have to do at Officer Canada's goal.

2018
01:44:22.28 --> 01:44:27.28
Every single time you talk, the entire time you're there, you have to yell at the top of your lungs.

2019
01:44:27.28 --> 01:44:30.28
So anyone that's shy is going to get over it.

2020
01:44:30.28 --> 01:44:34.28
Anyway, that's like an uncomfortable height of either professor when I went to college.

2021
01:44:34.28 --> 01:44:36.28
And when she spoke, she covered her mouth.

2022
01:44:36.28 --> 01:44:37.28
Yeah.

2023
01:44:37.28 --> 01:44:39.28
Every time she spoke, she covered her mouth.

2024
01:44:39.28 --> 01:44:40.28
Because she just didn't want to talk.

2025
01:44:40.28 --> 01:44:42.28
And she was a professor.

2026
01:44:42.28 --> 01:44:43.28
You know?

2027
01:44:43.28 --> 01:44:47.28
So she needs to go to OCS and yell at the top of her lungs for 13 weeks.

2028
01:44:47.28 --> 01:44:51.28
She didn't walk out of there going hand away from mouth talking confidently to each of the

2029
01:44:51.28 --> 01:44:52.28
glass.

2030
01:44:52.28 --> 01:44:53.28
Yeah.

2031
01:44:53.28 --> 01:44:54.28
Let's do it.

2032
01:44:54.28 --> 01:44:55.28
Yeah.

2033
01:44:55.28 --> 01:44:56.28
That's, I assume that's pretty common.

2034
01:44:56.28 --> 01:44:57.28
I don't like the yell.

2035
01:44:57.28 --> 01:45:00.28
You know, when they're like, hey, like actually yell in whatever.

2036
01:45:00.28 --> 01:45:01.28
Yeah.

2037
01:45:01.28 --> 01:45:02.28
I don't really like to do it.

2038
01:45:02.28 --> 01:45:06.28
I, I, I, I, I get you a billet of OCS 13 weeks of yelling.

2039
01:45:06.28 --> 01:45:07.28
Yeah.

2040
01:45:07.28 --> 01:45:10.28
Maybe get that voice adjusted a little bit.

2041
01:45:10.28 --> 01:45:12.28
Yeah.

2042
01:45:12.28 --> 01:45:14.28
Check.

2043
01:45:14.28 --> 01:45:19.28
Uh, section here on infantry.

2044
01:45:19.28 --> 01:45:22.28
Infantry must move in order to close with the enemy.

2045
01:45:22.28 --> 01:45:26.28
It must shoot in order to move covered move.

2046
01:45:26.28 --> 01:45:28.28
I need to make this stuff up, man.

2047
01:45:28.28 --> 01:45:31.28
It's so interesting when people, you know,

2048
01:45:31.28 --> 01:45:34.28
they say, uh, say, oh, I don't know about that.

2049
01:45:34.28 --> 01:45:36.28
Techno covered move is a real thing.

2050
01:45:36.28 --> 01:45:37.28
It's undeniable.

2051
01:45:37.28 --> 01:45:38.28
Yeah.

2052
01:45:38.28 --> 01:45:39.28
Undeniable.

2053
01:45:39.28 --> 01:45:48.28
Um, when physical targets are not visible, the fire of all infantry weapons must search the area.

2054
01:45:48.28 --> 01:45:50.28
Probably occupied by the enemy.

2055
01:45:50.28 --> 01:45:53.28
I remember when I learned that for the first time.

2056
01:45:53.28 --> 01:45:57.28
I remember I, I think was actually, I think it might have been Roger Hayden.

2057
01:45:57.28 --> 01:46:00.28
That was like, no, shoot where you think the enemy would be.

2058
01:46:00.28 --> 01:46:09.28
And I was like, oh, because if you think where they could be, I mean, when you're getting fired at from a certain area,

2059
01:46:09.28 --> 01:46:11.28
you look to that area.

2060
01:46:11.28 --> 01:46:13.28
You can't tell exactly where the enemy is.

2061
01:46:13.28 --> 01:46:19.28
So you shoot in the five most likely places that you see there.

2062
01:46:19.28 --> 01:46:22.28
And everyone else in your platoon or task unit is doing the same thing.

2063
01:46:22.28 --> 01:46:25.28
You're going to be shooting at the bad guys like somewhere.

2064
01:46:25.28 --> 01:46:35.28
Um, it reduces and when you're doing that, it reduces the accuracy of his fire and increases our confidence.

2065
01:46:35.28 --> 01:46:36.28
Shoot short.

2066
01:46:36.28 --> 01:46:38.28
This is another thing we learned all the time.

2067
01:46:38.28 --> 01:46:42.28
Ricochet make nastier sounds and wounds.

2068
01:46:42.28 --> 01:46:43.28
Do you understand that?

2069
01:46:43.28 --> 01:46:46.28
So when you're shooting at a bad guy, shoot low.

2070
01:46:46.28 --> 01:46:47.28
Yeah.

2071
01:46:47.28 --> 01:46:48.28
Who's that?

2072
01:46:48.28 --> 01:46:49.28
Someone who's saying that.

2073
01:46:49.28 --> 01:46:50.28
That's a brother he did.

2074
01:46:50.28 --> 01:46:51.28
We all see as prior, right?

2075
01:46:51.28 --> 01:46:52.28
Yeah.

2076
01:46:52.28 --> 01:46:53.28
Walking it in with a machine gun.

2077
01:46:53.28 --> 01:46:54.28
Yeah.

2078
01:46:54.28 --> 01:46:55.28
The ricochets are fine.

2079
01:46:55.28 --> 01:46:56.28
What ricochets?

2080
01:46:56.28 --> 01:46:58.28
That means the bullets tumbling when it hits you.

2081
01:46:58.28 --> 01:46:59.28
It's a nightmare.

2082
01:46:59.28 --> 01:47:00.28
Yeah.

2083
01:47:00.28 --> 01:47:01.28
And he's done.

2084
01:47:01.28 --> 01:47:04.28
And if you shoot high, anything else right?

2085
01:47:04.28 --> 01:47:05.28
That's right.

2086
01:47:05.28 --> 01:47:08.28
So shoot short ricochets make nastier sounds and wounds.

2087
01:47:08.28 --> 01:47:11.28
To halt under fire is folly.

2088
01:47:11.28 --> 01:47:15.28
To halt under fire and not fire back is suicide.

2089
01:47:15.28 --> 01:47:17.28
Move forward out of fire.

2090
01:47:17.28 --> 01:47:22.28
Officers must set the example.

2091
01:47:22.28 --> 01:47:25.28
Next, well, skip a few sections here.

2092
01:47:25.28 --> 01:47:27.28
Few men are killed by the bayonet.

2093
01:47:27.28 --> 01:47:29.28
Many are scared of it.

2094
01:47:29.28 --> 01:47:32.28
Bayonet should be fixed when the fire fight starts.

2095
01:47:32.28 --> 01:47:38.28
Bayonet's must be sharpened by the individual soldier.

2096
01:47:38.28 --> 01:47:40.28
The German hates the bayonet.

2097
01:47:40.28 --> 01:47:43.28
And is inferior to our men with it.

2098
01:47:43.28 --> 01:47:46.28
Our men should know this.

2099
01:47:46.28 --> 01:47:48.28
That is psychological warfare.

2100
01:47:48.28 --> 01:47:50.28
Like what he's actually doing sure.

2101
01:47:50.28 --> 01:47:55.28
He's saying that you have to sharpen your own bayonet.

2102
01:47:55.28 --> 01:48:00.28
Think about the psychological beauty of that scenario.

2103
01:48:00.28 --> 01:48:01.28
Yep.

2104
01:48:01.28 --> 01:48:04.28
And then you think the German hate.

2105
01:48:04.28 --> 01:48:06.28
Just pat know the German individual soldier.

2106
01:48:06.28 --> 01:48:07.28
He doesn't know that.

2107
01:48:07.28 --> 01:48:08.28
But you know what?

2108
01:48:08.28 --> 01:48:13.28
I'm going to tell my freaking entire third army that the German hates the bayonet.

2109
01:48:13.28 --> 01:48:14.28
They're scared of it.

2110
01:48:14.28 --> 01:48:15.28
It makes sense.

2111
01:48:15.28 --> 01:48:17.28
And we're better at it than they are.

2112
01:48:17.28 --> 01:48:20.28
And even starts this whole thing if you people don't even kill the bayonet.

2113
01:48:20.28 --> 01:48:21.28
But it doesn't matter.

2114
01:48:21.28 --> 01:48:22.28
Scared of it.

2115
01:48:22.28 --> 01:48:23.28
Sharpen it.

2116
01:48:23.28 --> 01:48:26.28
We're better than that with the bayonet.

2117
01:48:26.28 --> 01:48:28.28
It will, it makes sense.

2118
01:48:28.28 --> 01:48:30.28
Like if you see,

2119
01:48:30.28 --> 01:48:33.28
You don't pick, but let's say like a guy.

2120
01:48:33.28 --> 01:48:34.28
Some crazy guy.

2121
01:48:34.28 --> 01:48:35.28
Your enemy.

2122
01:48:35.28 --> 01:48:36.28
He's mad. He wants to kill you.

2123
01:48:36.28 --> 01:48:37.28
And he has a gun.

2124
01:48:37.28 --> 01:48:39.28
You're like, okay, he has a gun.

2125
01:48:39.28 --> 01:48:40.28
We all have guns.

2126
01:48:40.28 --> 01:48:41.28
All good.

2127
01:48:41.28 --> 01:48:43.28
But if the guy has a psychotic blade on the front of his gun

2128
01:48:43.28 --> 01:48:45.28
and he's like sharpening it himself.

2129
01:48:45.28 --> 01:48:49.28
He's like, bro, I'm not going near that guy, but he's like that knife makes him seem crazy.

2130
01:48:49.28 --> 01:48:53.28
There is something very zen and beautiful about sharpening your knife too.

2131
01:48:53.28 --> 01:48:54.28
Yeah.

2132
01:48:54.28 --> 01:48:58.28
Like it's a, it's a sole cleansing task.

2133
01:48:58.28 --> 01:49:00.28
Sharpening your knives.

2134
01:49:00.28 --> 01:49:04.28
And you know, now I'm adding to that sharpening your shovel.

2135
01:49:04.28 --> 01:49:06.28
Good.

2136
01:49:06.28 --> 01:49:07.28
Good idea.

2137
01:49:07.28 --> 01:49:12.28
Next, the M1 rifle is the most deadly rifle in the world.

2138
01:49:12.28 --> 01:49:18.28
If you can not see the enemy, you can at least shoot at the place where he's apt to be same message there.

2139
01:49:18.28 --> 01:49:19.28
You've got something in here.

2140
01:49:19.28 --> 01:49:21.28
I might not have outlined it.

2141
01:49:21.28 --> 01:49:31.28
But just he basically, you know, these things that he's saying he knows that he's saying them for the psychological boost for his troops.

2142
01:49:31.28 --> 01:49:36.28
He says here, the defense will consist of mutually supporting small groups

2143
01:49:36.28 --> 01:49:40.28
arranged in depth and completely wired in.

2144
01:49:40.28 --> 01:49:54.28
He didn't say overlapping fields of fire, but he should have minds when we place talks about artillery talks about armor talks about recon talks about anti aircraft and anti tanks and look all those things are brilliant and I'm not

2145
01:49:54.28 --> 01:50:04.28
breezing through them because I don't love artillery and I don't love armor anybody that knows anything about me knows that I love armor and artillery.

2146
01:50:04.28 --> 01:50:09.28
But he, these, the sections in this are very, very tactical.

2147
01:50:09.28 --> 01:50:15.28
He talks about maintenance weapons will be kept in perfect order.

2148
01:50:15.28 --> 01:50:22.28
Preventative maintenance will be enforced, particular attention should be given to tire pressure, lubrication, battery voltage and water in radiators.

2149
01:50:22.28 --> 01:50:28.28
Vehicles will be serviced and made operational before their crews rest.

2150
01:50:28.28 --> 01:50:36.28
Vehicles will be marked in accordance with paragraph 6, tax 14, AR, 850, tax 5.

2151
01:50:36.28 --> 01:50:43.28
We were, we did a long, long mission like a whole cycle of darkness, my first opponent.

2152
01:50:43.28 --> 01:50:50.28
And we got back to base and everyone was beat in my leading pedi officer.

2153
01:50:50.28 --> 01:50:57.28
Wasn't he was the lead now and the lead now guys kind of guy that directs the convoy.

2154
01:50:57.28 --> 01:51:02.28
And we drove, we got back to the gate and back down on our base at Baghdad.

2155
01:51:02.28 --> 01:51:14.28
He's like he comes up on the radio and he's like, hey boss can we just take the vehicles back and refuel you know later.

2156
01:51:14.28 --> 01:51:16.28
And I let it sit right there like that.

2157
01:51:16.28 --> 01:51:18.28
I didn't say anything.

2158
01:51:18.28 --> 01:51:25.28
And then I finally go negative take it to the fuel be Poe and he's like Roger.

2159
01:51:25.28 --> 01:51:34.28
He already knew that. He already knew the answer. He was like Roger.

2160
01:51:34.28 --> 01:51:38.28
And I let everybody, I let everybody because we're exhausted man.

2161
01:51:38.28 --> 01:51:42.28
It's been and it was freezing cold. It was freezing cold.

2162
01:51:42.28 --> 01:51:44.28
It was raining.

2163
01:51:44.28 --> 01:51:48.28
So it's raining like so the and this is before we we had doors.

2164
01:51:48.28 --> 01:51:50.28
We didn't have doors on our home vise.

2165
01:51:50.28 --> 01:51:52.28
So it's probably.

2166
01:51:52.28 --> 01:51:55.28
Uh 35 or 40 degrees because there was a little bit of sleep happening.

2167
01:51:55.28 --> 01:52:01.28
So it was right around the freezing mark and we did probably a.

2168
01:52:01.28 --> 01:52:04.28
Four hour drive.

2169
01:52:04.28 --> 01:52:06.28
To get to the target area. The target was outside.

2170
01:52:06.28 --> 01:52:09.28
It took us a few hours to get this whole thing settled.

2171
01:52:09.28 --> 01:52:10.28
We ended up with a giant.

2172
01:52:10.28 --> 01:52:16.28
We ended up having to move around a giant cash of weapons that we captured.

2173
01:52:16.28 --> 01:52:21.28
Outside in the rain, Bob I'm blowing and we get in the vehicles and so you're in the vehicles.

2174
01:52:21.28 --> 01:52:27.28
It's 35 to 40 degrees. It's raining and you got a 50 mile an hour wind the entire time because there's

2175
01:52:27.28 --> 01:52:31.28
Door to door to door to door. So everyone's freezing when we get back the sun's coming up.

2176
01:52:31.28 --> 01:52:33.28
So it's been an entire cycle of darkness.

2177
01:52:33.28 --> 01:52:37.28
I don't know how many hours but something like no there's no sleep.

2178
01:52:37.28 --> 01:52:40.28
Yeah and LPO comes over the radio.

2179
01:52:40.28 --> 01:52:48.28
A boss can we just take it back to a camp and fuel a vehicles letter.

2180
01:52:48.28 --> 01:52:49.28
And I'm like.

2181
01:52:49.28 --> 01:52:50.28
Negative.

2182
01:52:50.28 --> 01:52:51.28
Let's take it.

2183
01:52:51.28 --> 01:52:52.28
We feel people.

2184
01:52:52.28 --> 01:52:53.28
Wait, where was this?

2185
01:52:53.28 --> 01:52:54.28
Back there.

2186
01:52:54.28 --> 01:52:56.28
Dang it gets that cold, huh?

2187
01:52:56.28 --> 01:52:57.28
Yeah.

2188
01:52:57.28 --> 01:52:59.28
Middle little winter.

2189
01:52:59.28 --> 01:53:00.28
Cold.

2190
01:53:00.28 --> 01:53:03.28
Especially with that 60 mile an hour wind.

2191
01:53:03.28 --> 01:53:05.28
Uh, so there you go.

2192
01:53:05.28 --> 01:53:07.28
That's the deal.

2193
01:53:07.28 --> 01:53:10.28
You take care of that team gear.

2194
01:53:10.28 --> 01:53:11.28
Makes sense.

2195
01:53:11.28 --> 01:53:16.28
Because I guarantee you that one time you decide you're going to not fuel up the vehicles.

2196
01:53:16.28 --> 01:53:21.28
That's the time you're going to call down on QRF and we would get called out on QRF's pretty regularly.

2197
01:53:21.28 --> 01:53:23.28
Not not all the time but I mean it was no.

2198
01:53:23.28 --> 01:53:26.28
It was a high it was a decent percentage.

2199
01:53:26.28 --> 01:53:27.28
Not a high percentage.

2200
01:53:27.28 --> 01:53:30.28
But there's a decent percentage that we get to call them and say, hey, we need QRF out here.

2201
01:53:30.28 --> 01:53:31.28
We need QRF over there.

2202
01:53:31.28 --> 01:53:32.28
We need that cool.

2203
01:53:32.28 --> 01:53:33.28
Let's cool.

2204
01:53:33.28 --> 01:53:36.28
You need quick reaction force meaning troops are in trouble.

2205
01:53:36.28 --> 01:53:39.28
Hold on while we refuel our vehicles.

2206
01:53:39.28 --> 01:53:40.28
No.

2207
01:53:40.28 --> 01:53:41.28
We're never going to do that.

2208
01:53:41.28 --> 01:53:45.28
And that's not to mention the precedent right where you know, and this goes for anything.

2209
01:53:45.28 --> 01:53:46.28
Whatever.

2210
01:53:46.28 --> 01:53:51.28
I know it's very prevalent with kids where, you know, they, they want to push up against the rule.

2211
01:53:51.28 --> 01:53:53.28
Not in some, you know, hostile way or whatever.

2212
01:53:53.28 --> 01:53:54.28
Just sort of like, there's a tendency.

2213
01:53:54.28 --> 01:53:56.28
Yeah, like, you know, like, I don't know.

2214
01:53:56.28 --> 01:53:58.28
No dessert during the week or something like this.

2215
01:53:58.28 --> 01:54:00.28
And then it's like a week night.

2216
01:54:00.28 --> 01:54:01.28
Can we have?

2217
01:54:01.28 --> 01:54:02.28
Come on.

2218
01:54:02.28 --> 01:54:03.28
We've been, you know, we've been.

2219
01:54:03.28 --> 01:54:04.28
No.

2220
01:54:04.28 --> 01:54:05.28
Not happening.

2221
01:54:05.28 --> 01:54:06.28
We're not doing it.

2222
01:54:06.28 --> 01:54:08.28
Yeah, you can dessert that one day.

2223
01:54:08.28 --> 01:54:14.28
It's kind of like, oh, they know like, oh, sure that's the rule, but underserved emotional circumstances.

2224
01:54:14.28 --> 01:54:17.28
We can get away with the cool thing.

2225
01:54:17.28 --> 01:54:19.28
I mean, and, you know, hey, you know what?

2226
01:54:19.28 --> 01:54:23.28
LPO is looking out for the boys, which is part of the job, right?

2227
01:54:23.28 --> 01:54:24.28
There's part of there's a push pole, right?

2228
01:54:24.28 --> 01:54:25.28
There's always that push pole.

2229
01:54:25.28 --> 01:54:26.28
He's looking out for the boys.

2230
01:54:26.28 --> 01:54:27.28
He knows their time.

2231
01:54:27.28 --> 01:54:33.28
Hey, look, even if we got called for QRF, we're not super effective because we've been up for

2232
01:54:33.28 --> 01:54:36.28
20, 30 hours, right?

2233
01:54:36.28 --> 01:54:37.28
Yeah.

2234
01:54:37.28 --> 01:54:38.28
So we're not super effective.

2235
01:54:38.28 --> 01:54:40.28
He's probably thinking about that, too.

2236
01:54:40.28 --> 01:54:41.28
Yeah.

2237
01:54:41.28 --> 01:54:42.28
Yeah, that's actually a good point.

2238
01:54:42.28 --> 01:54:45.28
He would technically have like a little argument.

2239
01:54:45.28 --> 01:54:46.28
Yeah, it's an argument.

2240
01:54:46.28 --> 01:54:48.28
You know, it's like, hey, we're like less effective in less important.

2241
01:54:48.28 --> 01:54:50.28
It has patterns said.

2242
01:54:50.28 --> 01:54:51.28
So hey, man.

2243
01:54:51.28 --> 01:54:52.28
So yeah, makes sense.

2244
01:54:52.28 --> 01:54:54.28
But we had to hold the line on that one.

2245
01:54:54.28 --> 01:54:55.28
Yeah, that makes sense.

2246
01:54:55.28 --> 01:54:57.28
The QRF situation makes sense.

2247
01:54:57.28 --> 01:54:59.28
Yeah, QRF situation is important.

2248
01:54:59.28 --> 01:55:02.28
Well, you'd rather the guys be a little bit more tired than the

2249
01:55:02.28 --> 01:55:04.28
vehicles be on empty.

2250
01:55:04.28 --> 01:55:06.28
There was a good moment of silence on that one.

2251
01:55:06.28 --> 01:55:08.28
The other good moment of silence.

2252
01:55:08.28 --> 01:55:12.28
We got, this is again, my first deployment to Iraq.

2253
01:55:12.28 --> 01:55:16.28
And we got ambushed in a convoy.

2254
01:55:16.28 --> 01:55:26.28
And pretty tip-galls in the number two vehicle, pretty typical that the enemy wouldn't realize

2255
01:55:26.28 --> 01:55:29.28
where we were because we would drive really fast, blacked out.

2256
01:55:29.28 --> 01:55:33.28
They wouldn't realize until towards the end of the convoy.

2257
01:55:33.28 --> 01:55:37.28
And so in this particular one, we got ambushed.

2258
01:55:37.28 --> 01:55:40.28
And it was mostly centered on the back vehicles, right?

2259
01:55:40.28 --> 01:55:45.28
But I was looking, you know, as I'm looking at my field of fire, you know, I can see all kinds of

2260
01:55:45.28 --> 01:55:46.28
tracers going by.

2261
01:55:46.28 --> 01:55:47.28
I can see.

2262
01:55:47.28 --> 01:55:52.28
And then they fired a couple RPGs that went over our convoy and exploded on my side of the road,

2263
01:55:52.28 --> 01:55:55.28
because they ambushed us from the other side.

2264
01:55:55.28 --> 01:55:58.28
So this big ambush happens and, you know, the call comes out,

2265
01:55:58.28 --> 01:56:02.28
which actually the calls made by the same guy that was asking the question earlier,

2266
01:56:02.28 --> 01:56:04.28
is the LPO who's leading off.

2267
01:56:04.28 --> 01:56:06.28
And, you know, he just pushed through a push,

2268
01:56:06.28 --> 01:56:07.28
which is totally normal.

2269
01:56:07.28 --> 01:56:08.28
So we did it.

2270
01:56:08.28 --> 01:56:10.28
And then we just keep going, right?

2271
01:56:10.28 --> 01:56:12.28
And I don't say anything.

2272
01:56:12.28 --> 01:56:16.28
And then my,

2273
01:56:16.28 --> 01:56:20.28
Patoon Chief, again, both my LPO and Patoon Chief also got a good time,

2274
01:56:20.28 --> 01:56:22.28
but he comes up in the radio.

2275
01:56:22.28 --> 01:56:26.28
And you can hear it his voice is a little bit spun up, you know?

2276
01:56:26.28 --> 01:56:31.28
And he's like, he's like, he's like,

2277
01:56:31.28 --> 01:56:35.28
hey, Choco, you heard who got ambushed back here?

2278
01:56:35.28 --> 01:56:37.28
And I just like, log moment of silence,

2279
01:56:37.28 --> 01:56:40.28
as I said, Roger.

2280
01:56:40.28 --> 01:56:42.28
That was it.

2281
01:56:42.28 --> 01:56:49.28
We did what we had to do, but those were funny moments of silence that happened from time to time.

2282
01:56:49.28 --> 01:56:53.28
Because everyone's kind of, because in my cartoons, in my task,

2283
01:56:53.28 --> 01:56:57.28
no talking on the radio was so limited, like no,

2284
01:56:57.28 --> 01:57:00.28
basically no one talked on the radio, you know?

2285
01:57:00.28 --> 01:57:02.28
Unless you had something really important to say.

2286
01:57:02.28 --> 01:57:05.28
And so when there was something on the radio,

2287
01:57:05.28 --> 01:57:08.28
everyone was 100% listening to.

2288
01:57:08.28 --> 01:57:10.28
And when someone is asking me a question,

2289
01:57:10.28 --> 01:57:13.28
everyone was a 1000% listening to what my response is going to be,

2290
01:57:13.28 --> 01:57:15.28
especially when it's like, hey, we might get some more sleep,

2291
01:57:15.28 --> 01:57:17.28
or hey, we just got ambushed, does Choco know?

2292
01:57:17.28 --> 01:57:19.28
It's like, both those people are going, what do we going to do?

2293
01:57:19.28 --> 01:57:21.28
Because there's a possibility, it's like, hey,

2294
01:57:21.28 --> 01:57:25.28
all stop, we're going to turn around and go and hunt down these people that I am bush to us,

2295
01:57:25.28 --> 01:57:27.28
which is not a good idea, and we didn't do it.

2296
01:57:27.28 --> 01:57:29.28
But you know, everyone's thinking maybe I'm going to say that,

2297
01:57:29.28 --> 01:57:31.28
or maybe I'm just saying whatever,

2298
01:57:31.28 --> 01:57:33.28
but everyone's listening to what my response is going to be,

2299
01:57:33.28 --> 01:57:39.28
a little moment of silence, dramatic effect, possibly, possibly.

2300
01:57:39.28 --> 01:57:42.28
Or I'm just actually, here's what's actually happening.

2301
01:57:42.28 --> 01:57:44.28
I'm sitting or considering this situation, you know?

2302
01:57:44.28 --> 01:57:45.28
Okay.

2303
01:57:45.28 --> 01:57:47.28
Is everyone okay?

2304
01:57:47.28 --> 01:57:49.28
They must be, or we can casually report,

2305
01:57:49.28 --> 01:57:53.28
or hey, maybe we should go and to sleep before we,

2306
01:57:53.28 --> 01:57:55.28
I'm thinking through the actual situation.

2307
01:57:55.28 --> 01:57:59.28
I'm not just, you know, trying to be a jerk,

2308
01:57:59.28 --> 01:58:01.28
trying to be cool, trying to be cool.

2309
01:58:01.28 --> 01:58:03.28
I'm actually thinking, okay.

2310
01:58:03.28 --> 01:58:05.28
I know we got ambushed.

2311
01:58:05.28 --> 01:58:07.28
I'm waiting for, is there's casualty?

2312
01:58:07.28 --> 01:58:09.28
I think, you know, I might as well say something like,

2313
01:58:09.28 --> 01:58:11.28
are we up?

2314
01:58:11.28 --> 01:58:13.28
Or no, the push through call comes, everyone calls,

2315
01:58:13.28 --> 01:58:17.28
calls vehicles up, from there, six is up, five is up, four is up,

2316
01:58:17.28 --> 01:58:19.28
three is up, so already know everyone's good.

2317
01:58:19.28 --> 01:58:21.28
We're already good.

2318
01:58:21.28 --> 01:58:23.28
Check.

2319
01:58:23.28 --> 01:58:25.28
All right.

2320
01:58:25.28 --> 01:58:27.28
This last section is called,

2321
01:58:27.28 --> 01:58:29.28
care of men,

2322
01:58:29.28 --> 01:58:33.28
which once again, you know,

2323
01:58:33.28 --> 01:58:35.28
you look at the, you look at the,

2324
01:58:35.28 --> 01:58:39.28
uh, leadership strategy and tactics manual,

2325
01:58:39.28 --> 01:58:43.28
and some of the most important things that I try to make,

2326
01:58:43.28 --> 01:58:45.28
as clear as possible, is that you got to,

2327
01:58:45.28 --> 01:58:47.28
you got to, you got to care about your men,

2328
01:58:47.28 --> 01:58:49.28
you got to care about your people.

2329
01:58:49.28 --> 01:58:51.28
That's what you got to do.

2330
01:58:51.28 --> 01:58:53.28
To a moochyama taught me.

2331
01:58:53.28 --> 01:58:57.28
I mean, I wouldn't say moochyama taught me that,

2332
01:58:57.28 --> 01:58:59.28
but when he said it,

2333
01:58:59.28 --> 01:59:02.28
I was like, that's the underpinning of everything, you know?

2334
01:59:02.28 --> 01:59:04.28
This thing that's been a,

2335
01:59:04.28 --> 01:59:07.28
a tenant of my leadership principles.

2336
01:59:07.28 --> 01:59:10.28
A, let's call it an,

2337
01:59:10.28 --> 01:59:12.28
let's call it a,

2338
01:59:12.28 --> 01:59:16.28
a sort of a,

2339
01:59:16.28 --> 01:59:17.28
a, a,

2340
01:59:17.28 --> 01:59:19.28
flying below the radar,

2341
01:59:19.28 --> 01:59:20.28
tenant, you know,

2342
01:59:20.28 --> 01:59:22.28
like, yeah, you got to take care of your people.

2343
01:59:22.28 --> 01:59:23.28
Yeah, totally get that.

2344
01:59:23.28 --> 01:59:24.28
But when I had moochyama,

2345
01:59:24.28 --> 01:59:26.28
general moochyama talk about it,

2346
01:59:26.28 --> 01:59:29.28
and we talked about hack worth and just,

2347
01:59:29.28 --> 01:59:31.28
I was like, oh, yeah.

2348
01:59:31.28 --> 01:59:33.28
It's not just,

2349
01:59:33.28 --> 01:59:34.28
it's not just under the radar.

2350
01:59:34.28 --> 01:59:36.28
It's the real thing.

2351
01:59:36.28 --> 01:59:39.28
So hence general patent,

2352
01:59:39.28 --> 01:59:42.28
it's got an entire section called care of men.

2353
01:59:42.28 --> 01:59:45.28
Officers are responsible not only for the conduct of their men in battle,

2354
01:59:45.28 --> 01:59:49.28
but also for their health and contentment when not fighting.

2355
01:59:49.28 --> 01:59:53.28
And officer must be the last man to take shelter from fire

2356
01:59:53.28 --> 01:59:55.28
and first to move forward.

2357
01:59:55.28 --> 01:59:59.28
Similarly, he must be the last man to look after his own comfort

2358
01:59:59.28 --> 02:00:01.28
at the close of a march.

2359
02:00:01.28 --> 02:00:04.28
He must see that his men are cared for.

2360
02:00:04.28 --> 02:00:07.28
The officer must constantly interest himself

2361
02:00:07.28 --> 02:00:09.28
in the rations of men.

2362
02:00:09.28 --> 02:00:13.28
He should know his men so well that any sign of sickness or nervous strain

2363
02:00:13.28 --> 02:00:17.28
will be apparent to him and he can teach such action as maybe necessary.

2364
02:00:17.28 --> 02:00:19.28
Again, why is he talking about this?

2365
02:00:19.28 --> 02:00:20.28
This is patent.

2366
02:00:20.28 --> 02:00:21.28
This is a known, they show the movie,

2367
02:00:21.28 --> 02:00:24.28
the big scene where he slaps around the guy is a coward and all that stuff.

2368
02:00:24.28 --> 02:00:26.28
Get that guy out of this ward.

2369
02:00:26.28 --> 02:00:28.28
He had this reputation.

2370
02:00:28.28 --> 02:00:31.28
That he's like abusive.

2371
02:00:31.28 --> 02:00:34.28
Freaking care about your men.

2372
02:00:34.28 --> 02:00:35.28
And think about what he's saying here.

2373
02:00:35.28 --> 02:00:38.28
Like the last guy to move for cover.

2374
02:00:38.28 --> 02:00:41.28
The last guy to take care of himself after a march.

2375
02:00:41.28 --> 02:00:46.28
The rations go to the men first.

2376
02:00:46.28 --> 02:00:47.28
Everything is about the troops.

2377
02:00:47.28 --> 02:00:49.28
That's what a leader is.

2378
02:00:49.28 --> 02:00:53.28
Continuing to look after his men's feet.

2379
02:00:53.28 --> 02:00:55.28
See that they have properly fitting shoes and good condition

2380
02:00:55.28 --> 02:00:59.28
at that their socks fit loose or tight socks make sore feet.

2381
02:00:59.28 --> 02:01:02.28
He must anticipate change of weather and see that proper clothing

2382
02:01:02.28 --> 02:01:07.28
and foot gear is asked for and obtained.

2383
02:01:07.28 --> 02:01:13.28
So that's what that's the last thing that he talks about

2384
02:01:13.28 --> 02:01:15.28
is caring for your men.

2385
02:01:15.28 --> 02:01:20.28
The successful soldier wins battles cheaply so far as his own casualties are concerned.

2386
02:01:20.28 --> 02:01:23.28
But he must remember that violent attacks,

2387
02:01:23.28 --> 02:01:29.28
although costly at the time save lives in the end.

2388
02:01:29.28 --> 02:01:34.28
So yes, that wants to say message he's been giving.

2389
02:01:34.28 --> 02:01:40.28
Violence, although it seems like it's going to increase casualties

2390
02:01:40.28 --> 02:01:45.28
if you attack violently it will save lives in the end.

2391
02:01:45.28 --> 02:01:51.28
And that right there is the best way that you can care for your people.

2392
02:01:51.28 --> 02:01:55.28
Have them ready, have them trained, have them disciplined.

2393
02:01:55.28 --> 02:02:00.28
And then go on the attack.

2394
02:02:00.28 --> 02:02:03.28
And this thing is signed, G.S. Patent Jr.

2395
02:02:03.28 --> 02:02:08.28
Lieutenant General, U.S. Army, commanding.

2396
02:02:08.28 --> 02:02:15.28
So awesome information from Patent once again.

2397
02:02:15.28 --> 02:02:18.28
I've got some more and we may have been roll right into.

2398
02:02:18.28 --> 02:02:21.28
I've got some more Patent stuff to talk about.

2399
02:02:21.28 --> 02:02:23.28
Because there's some things that people freak out about.

2400
02:02:23.28 --> 02:02:26.28
And we can't really get a plan.

2401
02:02:26.28 --> 02:02:27.28
Let's face it.

2402
02:02:27.28 --> 02:02:29.28
That's not really my style.

2403
02:02:29.28 --> 02:02:32.28
Flamboyance, not really my thing.

2404
02:02:32.28 --> 02:02:37.28
So he's got some things that we are going to need to talk about.

2405
02:02:37.28 --> 02:02:38.28
There we will.

2406
02:02:38.28 --> 02:02:40.28
Perhaps we'll do it next time.

2407
02:02:40.28 --> 02:02:41.28
But eventually we'll get to it.

2408
02:02:41.28 --> 02:02:45.28
So Patent, don't throw the baby out with the bath water.

2409
02:02:45.28 --> 02:02:48.28
If you don't like that, those parts of him because believe me,

2410
02:02:48.28 --> 02:02:50.28
his flamboyant is this guy was.

2411
02:02:50.28 --> 02:02:53.28
He's got a lot of people.

2412
02:02:53.28 --> 02:02:55.28
He's got a lot of people.

2413
02:02:55.28 --> 02:02:58.28
And we can all learn a lot.

2414
02:02:58.28 --> 02:03:02.28
We can also talk about the fact that he sometimes didn't play the game.

2415
02:03:02.28 --> 02:03:04.28
And he didn't get the positions.

2416
02:03:04.28 --> 02:03:07.28
He wanted to probably oftentimes because he didn't play the game.

2417
02:03:07.28 --> 02:03:09.28
So we can talk about all that stuff.

2418
02:03:09.28 --> 02:03:13.28
For now, we're going to hold what we got.

2419
02:03:13.28 --> 02:03:15.28
Just did some live gigs.

2420
02:03:15.28 --> 02:03:19.28
And I've done DC, New York, Austin, LA.

2421
02:03:19.28 --> 02:03:21.28
Everything sold out.

2422
02:03:21.28 --> 02:03:24.28
Seattle and San Francisco are still coming, but they're both already sold out.

2423
02:03:24.28 --> 02:03:26.28
But anyways, it's been awesome.

2424
02:03:26.28 --> 02:03:29.28
It's been an incredible experience.

2425
02:03:29.28 --> 02:03:31.28
And meeting everyone.

2426
02:03:31.28 --> 02:03:35.28
And I can't, this isn't to ask you to come because they're already done.

2427
02:03:35.28 --> 02:03:40.28
But I just wanted to say to everyone that came out to them.

2428
02:03:40.28 --> 02:03:42.28
Thank you for coming to them.

2429
02:03:42.28 --> 02:03:45.28
They were incredible to be a part of.

2430
02:03:45.28 --> 02:03:52.28
So, and I will schedule some more of them.

2431
02:03:52.28 --> 02:03:54.28
And maybe echo will come.

2432
02:03:54.28 --> 02:03:55.28
Oh, no.

2433
02:03:55.28 --> 02:03:56.28
Maybe.

2434
02:03:56.28 --> 02:03:58.28
Are you going to come to Seattle?

2435
02:03:58.28 --> 02:04:00.28
San Francisco.

2436
02:04:00.28 --> 02:04:01.28
San Francisco.

2437
02:04:01.28 --> 02:04:02.28
Okay.

2438
02:04:02.28 --> 02:04:03.28
Cool.

2439
02:04:03.28 --> 02:04:04.28
Sold out.

2440
02:04:04.28 --> 02:04:09.28
So if someone was just kind of waiting to hear if you were going to be there, you'd be late.

2441
02:04:09.28 --> 02:04:11.28
Awesome.

2442
02:04:11.28 --> 02:04:14.28
You know, with that.

2443
02:04:14.28 --> 02:04:21.28
Echo drones, we are trying to be, you know, we're taking advice from general pat and we're trying to be more disciplined.

2444
02:04:21.28 --> 02:04:25.28
We're trying to be more courageous in.

2445
02:04:25.28 --> 02:04:30.28
We're trying to be physically hardened.

2446
02:04:30.28 --> 02:04:32.28
We're trying to be better.

2447
02:04:32.28 --> 02:04:38.28
What do you know of that can perhaps help us in all those arenas.

2448
02:04:38.28 --> 02:04:45.28
Echoes.

2449
02:04:45.28 --> 02:04:46.28
Aside from sharpening our shovels, can we're going to do you just train today?

2450
02:04:46.28 --> 02:04:47.28
You didn't.

2451
02:04:47.28 --> 02:04:48.28
I did.

2452
02:04:48.28 --> 02:04:51.28
You were preoccupied.

2453
02:04:51.28 --> 02:04:53.28
Doing various things.

2454
02:04:53.28 --> 02:04:57.28
I was actually preparing for this podcast, which is what I have to do.

2455
02:04:57.28 --> 02:04:58.28
Yeah.

2456
02:04:58.28 --> 02:04:59.28
Well, I prepared for this.

2457
02:04:59.28 --> 02:05:00.28
No, no, no.

2458
02:05:00.28 --> 02:05:02.28
Press record.

2459
02:05:02.28 --> 02:05:03.28
Which is great.

2460
02:05:03.28 --> 02:05:04.28
It's more of a mental preparation.

2461
02:05:04.28 --> 02:05:06.28
But, you know, nonetheless.

2462
02:05:06.28 --> 02:05:08.28
I feel good about that.

2463
02:05:08.28 --> 02:05:09.28
How did you feel?

2464
02:05:09.28 --> 02:05:10.28
Did you get beyond us?

2465
02:05:10.28 --> 02:05:14.28
Were you like my goal was, I did not make my goal.

2466
02:05:14.28 --> 02:05:18.28
My goal was to be prepped by noon.

2467
02:05:18.28 --> 02:05:21.28
Coming here, train shower record.

2468
02:05:21.28 --> 02:05:23.28
That's that was the plan.

2469
02:05:23.28 --> 02:05:25.28
I did not accomplish my mission.

2470
02:05:25.28 --> 02:05:28.28
So I had to prioritize next.

2471
02:05:28.28 --> 02:05:33.28
We owe this podcast to our people.

2472
02:05:33.28 --> 02:05:38.28
We will not prioritize my personal agenda of training.

2473
02:05:38.28 --> 02:05:41.28
Above taking care of the troops.

2474
02:05:41.28 --> 02:05:43.28
The troops expected podcast.

2475
02:05:43.28 --> 02:05:44.28
On Wednesday.

2476
02:05:44.28 --> 02:05:46.28
Tuesday night, even.

2477
02:05:46.28 --> 02:05:47.28
We must deliver.

2478
02:05:47.28 --> 02:05:49.28
That means I have work to do.

2479
02:05:49.28 --> 02:05:51.28
I know it doesn't mean anything to you.

2480
02:05:51.28 --> 02:05:54.28
I know it doesn't even feel with any part of your personal life.

2481
02:05:54.28 --> 02:05:56.28
Any part of your personal time.

2482
02:05:56.28 --> 02:05:57.28
But I have work to do.

2483
02:05:57.28 --> 02:05:58.28
It does.

2484
02:05:58.28 --> 02:06:00.28
It's just more psychological.

2485
02:06:00.28 --> 02:06:01.28
Okay.

2486
02:06:01.28 --> 02:06:03.28
I'm going to do it.

2487
02:06:03.28 --> 02:06:04.28
You can tell in yourself that.

2488
02:06:04.28 --> 02:06:05.28
The last.

2489
02:06:05.28 --> 02:06:07.28
You're the bride.

2490
02:06:07.28 --> 02:06:08.28
Didn't ring in the man.

2491
02:06:08.28 --> 02:06:09.28
Of course.

2492
02:06:09.28 --> 02:06:12.28
And you know, I only say that because when you came in,

2493
02:06:12.28 --> 02:06:15.28
to tell end of, you know, you ready to, you know,

2494
02:06:15.28 --> 02:06:15.28
you know,

2495
02:06:15.28 --> 02:06:15.28
you're ready to, you know,

2496
02:06:15.28 --> 02:06:17.28
you're bored and you're trapped and you're good.

2497
02:06:17.28 --> 02:06:18.28
Even though you made me look,

2498
02:06:18.28 --> 02:06:20.28
you looked at me in a way that I was like,

2499
02:06:20.28 --> 02:06:21.28
okay, cool.

2500
02:06:21.28 --> 02:06:22.28
I could get changed right now.

2501
02:06:22.28 --> 02:06:24.28
What's what is that?

2502
02:06:24.28 --> 02:06:27.28
What you just said was Britain all over your face.

2503
02:06:27.28 --> 02:06:28.28
Like you came in there or some,

2504
02:06:28.28 --> 02:06:29.28
you know, there are some people here.

2505
02:06:29.28 --> 02:06:31.28
You know, boom, jocos, you know,

2506
02:06:31.28 --> 02:06:33.28
you know, here taking some pictures or whatever.

2507
02:06:33.28 --> 02:06:34.28
And me and all I'm like,

2508
02:06:34.28 --> 02:06:39.28
you see me and I've seen your face like,

2509
02:06:39.28 --> 02:06:41.28
oh man, you're a weird training like you're lucky.

2510
02:06:41.28 --> 02:06:43.28
And here's the actual funny,

2511
02:06:43.28 --> 02:06:44.28
but I'm just remembering that part.

2512
02:06:44.28 --> 02:06:46.28
The funny part is when you walked out on the mat,

2513
02:06:46.28 --> 02:06:48.28
you took off your shoes, you walk out of the mat.

2514
02:06:48.28 --> 02:06:50.28
And when you walk up on the mat,

2515
02:06:50.28 --> 02:06:52.28
I think this is just kind of in all of us anyway.

2516
02:06:52.28 --> 02:06:53.28
So where you sort of like,

2517
02:06:53.28 --> 02:06:55.28
you feel like for lack of energy at the mat.

2518
02:06:55.28 --> 02:06:57.28
So that's why it feels weird.

2519
02:06:57.28 --> 02:07:00.28
If you have your regular clothes on and you walk out on the mat,

2520
02:07:00.28 --> 02:07:01.28
you're like,

2521
02:07:01.28 --> 02:07:02.28
you feel weird.

2522
02:07:02.28 --> 02:07:06.28
So it's not jamming or it's not vibing together, you know?

2523
02:07:06.28 --> 02:07:08.28
So you walked out on the mat.

2524
02:07:08.28 --> 02:07:11.28
You're like the looking,

2525
02:07:11.28 --> 02:07:12.28
you're like,

2526
02:07:12.28 --> 02:07:14.28
you're kind of warming up for something like that.

2527
02:07:14.28 --> 02:07:17.28
Because think of how many thousands and thousands of times

2528
02:07:17.28 --> 02:07:20.28
when I take off my flip,

2529
02:07:20.28 --> 02:07:20.28
flops,

2530
02:07:20.28 --> 02:07:22.28
my slippers when we used to call them in Hawaii.

2531
02:07:22.28 --> 02:07:25.28
I take off my slippers and go on the mat.

2532
02:07:25.28 --> 02:07:27.28
That means something.

2533
02:07:27.28 --> 02:07:28.28
That's like,

2534
02:07:28.28 --> 02:07:31.28
it's like going to use to put down my nods on my helmet.

2535
02:07:31.28 --> 02:07:32.28
Flip down your nods,

2536
02:07:32.28 --> 02:07:33.28
all the sudden it's like,

2537
02:07:33.28 --> 02:07:33.28
okay,

2538
02:07:33.28 --> 02:07:34.28
it's on.

2539
02:07:34.28 --> 02:07:35.28
You're locking the original,

2540
02:07:35.28 --> 02:07:35.28
you're like,

2541
02:07:35.28 --> 02:07:36.28
okay.

2542
02:07:36.28 --> 02:07:37.28
You're locking the original,

2543
02:07:37.28 --> 02:07:38.28
you're wetping all the time,

2544
02:07:38.28 --> 02:07:39.28
you do it in your,

2545
02:07:39.28 --> 02:07:39.28
oh,

2546
02:07:39.28 --> 02:07:40.28
you're like,

2547
02:07:40.28 --> 02:07:40.28
okay,

2548
02:07:40.28 --> 02:07:41.28
cool.

2549
02:07:41.28 --> 02:07:41.28
This is it.

2550
02:07:41.28 --> 02:07:43.28
So I walk out on the mat,

2551
02:07:43.28 --> 02:07:44.28
take off my slippers,

2552
02:07:44.28 --> 02:07:46.28
walk out on the mat.

2553
02:07:46.28 --> 02:07:47.28
You felt the littleikal.

2554
02:07:47.28 --> 02:07:48.28
And

2555
02:07:48.28 --> 02:07:49.28
you know,

2556
02:07:49.28 --> 02:07:49.28
it's like,

2557
02:07:49.28 --> 02:07:52.28
and I see you kind of

2558
02:07:53.28 --> 02:07:54.28
giving off a vibe,

2559
02:07:54.28 --> 02:07:55.12
vibe, right?

2560
02:07:56.12 --> 02:07:59.28
When I think because you were you were literally pacing.

2561
02:07:59.28 --> 02:08:00.24
Oh, and here's the thing.

2562
02:08:00.24 --> 02:08:02.92
We weren't being hostile making jokes like that kind of wasn't like,

2563
02:08:02.92 --> 02:08:03.60
we were in church.

2564
02:08:03.60 --> 02:08:06.52
It wasn't that we were talking about something like for a like legitimately normal,

2565
02:08:06.88 --> 02:08:08.52
but you were pacing out there.

2566
02:08:08.52 --> 02:08:10.24
Oh, I was like, I wanted to see.

2567
02:08:10.24 --> 02:08:11.28
Straight right back to that.

2568
02:08:11.28 --> 02:08:12.28
That pissed me off.

2569
02:08:12.68 --> 02:08:13.28
Amen.

2570
02:08:13.64 --> 02:08:14.28
That's life.

2571
02:08:14.28 --> 02:08:15.000
Actually, that's the go.

2572
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:15.16
Okay.

2573
02:08:15.16 --> 02:08:18.000
So, you just do that's one of the many good things about you.

2574
02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.64
You just do that mentioned this before where it's like so good exercise.

2575
02:08:21.64 --> 02:08:24.000
So good mentally physically like all this stuff.

2576
02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:25.000
It's literally fun.

2577
02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Yeah, it's literally fun.

2578
02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.000
It's literally fun.

2579
02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:32.64
Yeah, like if you come in and this goes for me, even if I'm like there just to record whatever

2580
02:08:32.64 --> 02:08:36.44
and not to train for a like I'm here for a specific reason, not to train or whatever.

2581
02:08:36.44 --> 02:08:38.32
And I come and I see people training whatever.

2582
02:08:38.32 --> 02:08:40.92
I literally feel like I'm missing out like I'm missing.

2583
02:08:40.92 --> 02:08:43.48
You know how like when your friends go hang out and go do something and you gotta stay

2584
02:08:43.48 --> 02:08:45.32
home and like do a normal one for sure.

2585
02:08:45.32 --> 02:08:48.000
Yeah, it felt like you felt you kind of missed out.

2586
02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.000
I did.

2587
02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:50.000
I did.

2588
02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.000
It's all good.

2589
02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.32
But to me, this podcast is very good.

2590
02:08:52.32 --> 02:08:55.52
So I'm kind of glad you did and the good news about it is you're just going to be

2591
02:08:55.52 --> 02:08:56.52
here.

2592
02:08:56.52 --> 02:08:57.52
This is going to be your tomorrow.

2593
02:08:57.52 --> 02:08:58.52
It's going to be here next week.

2594
02:08:58.52 --> 02:08:59.52
But I can't ever get this day back of training.

2595
02:08:59.52 --> 02:09:00.52
Yeah, by the bed little something.

2596
02:09:00.52 --> 02:09:03.52
Yeah, I think I'd learn to maybe next time.

2597
02:09:03.52 --> 02:09:05.52
It's all part of the game.

2598
02:09:05.52 --> 02:09:06.52
Up, downs.

2599
02:09:06.52 --> 02:09:07.52
You know, every single day.

2600
02:09:07.52 --> 02:09:09.52
Almost sounded like a threat.

2601
02:09:09.52 --> 02:09:10.52
No, sorry.

2602
02:09:10.52 --> 02:09:11.52
It is not to late to train.

2603
02:09:11.52 --> 02:09:12.52
It is right now.

2604
02:09:12.52 --> 02:09:14.52
Because we will do it.

2605
02:09:14.52 --> 02:09:15.92
Uh, not a threat.

2606
02:09:15.92 --> 02:09:18.12
You know, I'm just saying that's that's how it goes sometimes.

2607
02:09:18.12 --> 02:09:19.12
You said a little something.

2608
02:09:19.12 --> 02:09:21.12
I meant learning wise.

2609
02:09:21.12 --> 02:09:22.12
Good.

2610
02:09:22.12 --> 02:09:24.12
You know, the last.

2611
02:09:24.12 --> 02:09:26.72
Hey, it will be here.

2612
02:09:26.72 --> 02:09:31.80
And actually, which kind of led and support to the point that, hey, not everyone is doing

2613
02:09:31.80 --> 02:09:32.80
you just right now.

2614
02:09:32.80 --> 02:09:33.80
But guess what?

2615
02:09:33.80 --> 02:09:34.80
This should be.

2616
02:09:34.80 --> 02:09:36.24
If you go tomorrow, it'll be there.

2617
02:09:36.24 --> 02:09:37.64
If you walk in tomorrow.

2618
02:09:37.64 --> 02:09:38.64
Yeah.

2619
02:09:38.64 --> 02:09:41.08
And also if you walk in and it's your first thing, you don't know anything about it.

2620
02:09:41.08 --> 02:09:42.08
There's other people.

2621
02:09:42.08 --> 02:09:44.08
Everyone on that mat has been there.

2622
02:09:44.08 --> 02:09:46.96
There's nothing to be embarrassed about, you know, go get on the mat.

2623
02:09:46.96 --> 02:09:49.000
And if I can chance, sorry, that's a good point right there.

2624
02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.08
These chances are more people are going to be like new people.

2625
02:09:52.08 --> 02:09:53.08
Yes.

2626
02:09:53.08 --> 02:09:54.08
They're in advance for.

2627
02:09:54.08 --> 02:09:57.92
Or probably, what would you say would be the average if you go on any ran?

2628
02:09:57.92 --> 02:09:58.92
No.

2629
02:09:58.92 --> 02:10:02.72
And ran a lot of times they have the beginners class, which is even bigger percentage.

2630
02:10:02.72 --> 02:10:03.72
Yeah.

2631
02:10:03.72 --> 02:10:04.72
New people.

2632
02:10:04.72 --> 02:10:05.72
I think it's a bell curve.

2633
02:10:05.72 --> 02:10:06.72
Yeah, it's like half, right?

2634
02:10:06.72 --> 02:10:07.72
Well, you say a half for weight.

2635
02:10:07.72 --> 02:10:08.72
A bell curve.

2636
02:10:08.72 --> 02:10:10.76
Bottom 10% like they don't know anything.

2637
02:10:10.76 --> 02:10:11.76
Or they vote.

2638
02:10:11.76 --> 02:10:15.72
Bottom 10% three months or less of training.

2639
02:10:15.72 --> 02:10:22.84
The middle is whatever, anywhere between three months and five years.

2640
02:10:22.84 --> 02:10:26.24
And then there's like the top 10% have been training for actually at our school is a lot more

2641
02:10:26.24 --> 02:10:28.44
than yeah, that we are a little heavy on the top end.

2642
02:10:28.44 --> 02:10:30.44
What have you on the bottom end, too?

2643
02:10:30.44 --> 02:10:31.44
No, it's a little heavy on the top end.

2644
02:10:31.44 --> 02:10:35.32
No, no, no, you're, your, your, our school is so big.

2645
02:10:35.32 --> 02:10:37.64
And like, you know, there's the key part.

2646
02:10:37.64 --> 02:10:41.04
There's no key then it's like where, you know, like they advance guys.

2647
02:10:41.04 --> 02:10:45.12
But I'm just saying like, what I get on the mat, there's most, there's so many people

2648
02:10:45.12 --> 02:10:49.16
that have five years, eight years, 10 years, it's a lot of people.

2649
02:10:49.16 --> 02:10:50.36
Yeah, that's true.

2650
02:10:50.36 --> 02:10:52.36
But there's a bunch of people, too, that just started.

2651
02:10:52.36 --> 02:10:53.36
Right.

2652
02:10:53.36 --> 02:10:54.68
You know what, what it could be.

2653
02:10:54.68 --> 02:10:59.000
And then again, I'm over here just researching it right now in my head where it could

2654
02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:00.000
be.

2655
02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.000
That's not research, right?

2656
02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:01.76
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2657
02:11:01.76 --> 02:11:02.76
That's just thinking.

2658
02:11:02.76 --> 02:11:10.08
Maybe when you go out on the mat and you see all our advance guys, or should I say all the

2659
02:11:10.08 --> 02:11:12.88
guys that are here that are advanced, Chence, or you know them.

2660
02:11:12.88 --> 02:11:16.60
So they're like, oh man, we have a lot of them, you know, whatever, but me and my life

2661
02:11:16.60 --> 02:11:19.20
is the same thing about people that I don't know.

2662
02:11:19.20 --> 02:11:21.52
Yeah, I guess, yeah, that's true, too.

2663
02:11:21.52 --> 02:11:22.76
Because I don't know that guy.

2664
02:11:22.76 --> 02:11:24.40
He must not ever train before.

2665
02:11:24.40 --> 02:11:25.52
He could be training for a year.

2666
02:11:25.52 --> 02:11:26.52
Right.

2667
02:11:26.52 --> 02:11:28.000
Yeah, that's true, too.

2668
02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.60
I mean, most, if someone's training you for a year, I know.

2669
02:11:30.60 --> 02:11:32.96
Yeah, but, yeah, it's different.

2670
02:11:32.96 --> 02:11:33.96
It's a different.

2671
02:11:33.96 --> 02:11:35.96
But yeah, I think so.

2672
02:11:35.96 --> 02:11:40.16
But, and, but then you have to think about the belt distribution curve, too.

2673
02:11:40.16 --> 02:11:45.40
It's like super bottom heavy, because as you progress up the belt ranks, either progress,

2674
02:11:45.40 --> 02:11:49.04
yeah, so exactly right, because you progress out of the belt or out of Gigiitu.

2675
02:11:49.04 --> 02:11:50.04
Right.

2676
02:11:50.04 --> 02:11:51.04
Okay, so you mentioned ghee, no ghee.

2677
02:11:51.04 --> 02:11:52.04
What does all that mean?

2678
02:11:52.04 --> 02:11:53.04
Thanks, Chuck.

2679
02:11:53.04 --> 02:11:59.04
Anyway, I get a ghee, get an origin ghee, everybody knows that's the best ghee in the

2680
02:11:59.04 --> 02:12:00.04
world straight up.

2681
02:12:00.04 --> 02:12:04.96
Factually, you mentioned facts versus opinions is the fact that an opinion happens to

2682
02:12:04.96 --> 02:12:08.96
be made in America along with other stuff.

2683
02:12:08.96 --> 02:12:09.96
OriginMain.com.

2684
02:12:09.96 --> 02:12:12.40
Yes, always where we get these things that are made in America.

2685
02:12:12.40 --> 02:12:13.40
All this stuff.

2686
02:12:13.40 --> 02:12:15.40
Including 100% made in America?

2687
02:12:15.40 --> 02:12:16.40
Yes.

2688
02:12:16.40 --> 02:12:20.04
What about where the substances that they're made of, where those things from?

2689
02:12:20.04 --> 02:12:21.44
Like the cotton that's grown.

2690
02:12:21.44 --> 02:12:22.44
Yes.

2691
02:12:22.44 --> 02:12:23.80
So they can put it through the loom.

2692
02:12:23.80 --> 02:12:24.80
Yeah.

2693
02:12:24.80 --> 02:12:27.24
A million different moving parts in the loom, by the way.

2694
02:12:27.24 --> 02:12:33.32
And made into the fabric that is woven and then constructed into various items.

2695
02:12:33.32 --> 02:12:34.32
Okay.

2696
02:12:34.32 --> 02:12:36.72
Including ghee's and including jeans.

2697
02:12:36.72 --> 02:12:39.68
Oh yeah, jeans.

2698
02:12:39.68 --> 02:12:40.68
Boots.

2699
02:12:40.68 --> 02:12:41.68
Boots.

2700
02:12:41.68 --> 02:12:46.68
T-shirts, shirts and rash guards.

2701
02:12:46.68 --> 02:12:48.48
So it is clothing is what we're talking about.

2702
02:12:48.48 --> 02:12:49.48
Beanie's.

2703
02:12:49.48 --> 02:12:50.48
Okay, so you can get a lot of clothing.

2704
02:12:50.48 --> 02:12:52.12
Made in America.

2705
02:12:52.12 --> 02:12:53.12
Best clothing ever.

2706
02:12:53.12 --> 02:12:54.92
In the world, factually.

2707
02:12:54.92 --> 02:12:55.92
Yeah.

2708
02:12:55.92 --> 02:12:57.56
How many jeans have I owned in my life?

2709
02:12:57.56 --> 02:12:58.56
Probably.

2710
02:12:58.56 --> 02:13:02.16
Okay, my don't life, I've probably owned.

2711
02:13:02.16 --> 02:13:03.88
Let's call it.

2712
02:13:03.88 --> 02:13:04.88
Not a lot.

2713
02:13:04.88 --> 02:13:05.88
There's not a lot of jeans.

2714
02:13:05.88 --> 02:13:08.64
Because I would have jeans for like eight years.

2715
02:13:08.64 --> 02:13:09.64
Right?

2716
02:13:09.64 --> 02:13:11.32
Seems like probably.

2717
02:13:11.32 --> 02:13:12.72
Maybe eight years as long.

2718
02:13:12.72 --> 02:13:15.60
But anyways, I'd have jeans for a while.

2719
02:13:15.60 --> 02:13:22.28
I probably had 20 pairs of jeans in my adult life.

2720
02:13:22.28 --> 02:13:28.20
Now, my jeans, origin jeans are the best jeans that I've ever worn.

2721
02:13:28.20 --> 02:13:34.000
Now, I can't say I've ever worn a pair of $640.

2722
02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:35.000
What do those call?

2723
02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:36.24
Like, skinny, no.

2724
02:13:36.24 --> 02:13:37.44
I haven't even owned any of those.

2725
02:13:37.44 --> 02:13:41.24
I haven't had any of the low-rise boot cuts.

2726
02:13:41.24 --> 02:13:43.84
Yeah, like, well, no, I mean, what's the word?

2727
02:13:43.84 --> 02:13:46.12
Designer jeans.

2728
02:13:46.12 --> 02:13:54.32
Even, even at the height of designer jeans, which, by the way, at the height of all

2729
02:13:54.32 --> 02:13:59.84
that stuff, MMA was totally wrapped around that stuff.

2730
02:13:59.84 --> 02:14:00.84
All right.

2731
02:14:00.84 --> 02:14:03.96
Like, if you were to develop, if you were to find

2732
02:14:03.96 --> 02:14:16.44
a picture in 2008 of a bunch of MMA guys of which you and I both were, there is a high

2733
02:14:16.44 --> 02:14:24.32
percentage that 50% of the individuals in that picture would be wearing jeans that had

2734
02:14:24.32 --> 02:14:26.52
non-functional aspects to them.

2735
02:14:26.52 --> 02:14:29.52
I think you're right.

2736
02:14:29.52 --> 02:14:33.52
And therefore, they would be determined as designers and they cost, you know,

2737
02:14:33.52 --> 02:14:35.76
several hundred dollars.

2738
02:14:35.76 --> 02:14:36.76
Yeah.

2739
02:14:36.76 --> 02:14:42.50
So, even at the height of that, you cannot find pictures of me in jeans that have

2740
02:14:42.50 --> 02:14:44.56
non-functional aspects.

2741
02:14:44.56 --> 02:14:47.76
You know, only find me in jeans that have functional aspects.

2742
02:14:47.76 --> 02:14:48.76
I believe that.

2743
02:14:48.76 --> 02:14:49.76
I believe that.

2744
02:14:49.76 --> 02:14:50.76
So, check.

2745
02:14:50.76 --> 02:14:54.28
You can get jeans from a large amount that are functional.

2746
02:14:54.28 --> 02:14:55.28
Functional slightly.

2747
02:14:55.28 --> 02:14:59.28
There's no designer.

2748
02:14:59.28 --> 02:15:00.28
No designer.

2749
02:15:00.28 --> 02:15:01.28
No, no fashion.

2750
02:15:01.28 --> 02:15:02.28
Do they fashion?

2751
02:15:02.28 --> 02:15:03.28
No fashion.

2752
02:15:03.28 --> 02:15:04.28
No fashion.

2753
02:15:04.28 --> 02:15:06.84
The form follows function.

2754
02:15:06.84 --> 02:15:08.84
So, do they look appropriate?

2755
02:15:08.84 --> 02:15:09.84
Absolutely.

2756
02:15:09.84 --> 02:15:10.84
Yeah.

2757
02:15:10.84 --> 02:15:11.84
There you go.

2758
02:15:11.84 --> 02:15:13.84
Do they have spirit?

2759
02:15:13.84 --> 02:15:14.84
Yes.

2760
02:15:14.84 --> 02:15:16.84
Do they have soul affirmative?

2761
02:15:16.84 --> 02:15:17.84
Yeah.

2762
02:15:17.84 --> 02:15:18.84
Okay.

2763
02:15:18.84 --> 02:15:20.56
Well, they're the only jeans that I wear.

2764
02:15:20.56 --> 02:15:23.92
So, you know, obviously, I'm not, I'm trying to tease out the stuff.

2765
02:15:23.92 --> 02:15:24.92
Oh, you got yourself a bit.

2766
02:15:24.92 --> 02:15:25.92
You milked it.

2767
02:15:25.92 --> 02:15:26.92
No, not the Delta.

2768
02:15:26.92 --> 02:15:27.92
Oh, you got yourself a 16-year-old.

2769
02:15:27.92 --> 02:15:28.92
Yeah.

2770
02:15:28.92 --> 02:15:31.52
Just a regular, you know, functional.

2771
02:15:31.52 --> 02:15:32.52
That's a good idea.

2772
02:15:32.52 --> 02:15:33.52
That's a good idea.

2773
02:15:33.52 --> 02:15:34.52
Oh, yeah.

2774
02:15:34.52 --> 02:15:35.52
Very good though.

2775
02:15:35.52 --> 02:15:36.52
Nonetheless, yes, OriginMaint.com.

2776
02:15:36.52 --> 02:15:37.52
You can get all this stuff.

2777
02:15:37.52 --> 02:15:38.52
Also supplements.

2778
02:15:38.52 --> 02:15:40.52
Joint warfare, krill oil.

2779
02:15:40.52 --> 02:15:41.52
These are for your joints.

2780
02:15:41.52 --> 02:15:42.52
Maintain.

2781
02:15:42.52 --> 02:15:43.52
Stay in the game.

2782
02:15:43.52 --> 02:15:44.52
For real.

2783
02:15:44.52 --> 02:15:45.52
You can be super strong.

2784
02:15:45.52 --> 02:15:47.52
You can squat 600 pounds.

2785
02:15:47.52 --> 02:15:48.52
Literally.

2786
02:15:48.52 --> 02:15:51.52
If you can squat 600 pounds, but your joints are jamming you up.

2787
02:15:51.52 --> 02:15:52.52
But you're not squatting nothing.

2788
02:15:52.52 --> 02:15:53.52
No.

2789
02:15:53.52 --> 02:15:55.52
You may be able to do your warm-up set.

2790
02:15:55.52 --> 02:15:56.52
Yeah.

2791
02:15:56.52 --> 02:15:58.52
And then just sort of not squat.

2792
02:15:58.52 --> 02:16:00.52
Whatever deadlift you're doing.

2793
02:16:00.52 --> 02:16:01.52
Just joint warfare.

2794
02:16:01.52 --> 02:16:02.52
It's krill oil.

2795
02:16:02.52 --> 02:16:03.52
These are very good for your joints.

2796
02:16:03.52 --> 02:16:04.52
And then we'll keep you in the game.

2797
02:16:04.52 --> 02:16:06.52
Discipline and discipline go.

2798
02:16:06.52 --> 02:16:12.84
I'm not going to say that I lived off of it on my last week and a half when I was getting

2799
02:16:12.84 --> 02:16:17.52
zero sleep and just having to do interviews with people.

2800
02:16:17.52 --> 02:16:20.52
Well, those things end at what?

2801
02:16:20.52 --> 02:16:22.16
Nine technically, but you just go, right?

2802
02:16:22.16 --> 02:16:23.52
Because you don't like leave.

2803
02:16:23.52 --> 02:16:24.52
Oh, no, no.

2804
02:16:24.52 --> 02:16:25.52
No, that's cool.

2805
02:16:25.52 --> 02:16:30.32
Though the live gigs for sure, but getting interviewed by whatever different

2806
02:16:30.32 --> 02:16:35.32
channels I had to wake up at one o'clock in the morning to go on coast to coast.

2807
02:16:35.32 --> 02:16:36.32
A.M.

2808
02:16:36.32 --> 02:16:37.32
Have you ever listened to that?

2809
02:16:37.32 --> 02:16:38.32
Not that it knows.

2810
02:16:38.32 --> 02:16:40.32
Anyways, I always up at one o'clock in the morning.

2811
02:16:40.32 --> 02:16:41.32
One to three.

2812
02:16:41.32 --> 02:16:47.32
And then whatever, six, 45, I was sitting in a studio on national TV getting interviewed.

2813
02:16:47.32 --> 02:16:51.32
You know, like, so no sleep, no food, no factor.

2814
02:16:51.32 --> 02:16:52.32
Guess what?

2815
02:16:52.32 --> 02:16:53.32
Discipline go, get some.

2816
02:16:53.32 --> 02:16:55.32
You can feel it.

2817
02:16:55.32 --> 02:16:58.32
But the can, you can feel it.

2818
02:16:58.32 --> 02:17:01.32
Make some jockel Palmer totally good to go.

2819
02:17:01.32 --> 02:17:07.32
Get your A game on and it and take yourself one of the discipline go.

2820
02:17:07.32 --> 02:17:09.32
Pills.

2821
02:17:09.32 --> 02:17:12.32
Get that.

2822
02:17:12.32 --> 02:17:14.32
Hitter.

2823
02:17:14.32 --> 02:17:17.32
Mulk, by the way.

2824
02:17:17.32 --> 02:17:19.32
Yeah.

2825
02:17:19.32 --> 02:17:21.32
Mulk.

2826
02:17:21.32 --> 02:17:24.32
Is there?

2827
02:17:24.32 --> 02:17:26.32
Mulk, I was like, because I've been, you know, I have the big,

2828
02:17:26.32 --> 02:17:28.32
uh, what is it?

2829
02:17:28.32 --> 02:17:29.32
Containers.

2830
02:17:29.32 --> 02:17:31.32
But I have the packages left over from mustard.

2831
02:17:31.32 --> 02:17:32.32
Whatever are these been nice.

2832
02:17:32.32 --> 02:17:34.32
Do, does origin?

2833
02:17:34.32 --> 02:17:35.32
Yes.

2834
02:17:35.32 --> 02:17:36.32
Sell the packs.

2835
02:17:36.32 --> 02:17:37.32
Okay.

2836
02:17:37.32 --> 02:17:38.32
Okay.

2837
02:17:38.32 --> 02:17:40.32
So yeah, if you just real, just want to hit her.

2838
02:17:40.32 --> 02:17:41.32
That's hit her.

2839
02:17:41.32 --> 02:17:42.32
You know what?

2840
02:17:42.32 --> 02:17:44.32
Say, I'm mulk extra protein in the form of a dessert.

2841
02:17:44.32 --> 02:17:46.32
Hitter or otherwise.

2842
02:17:46.32 --> 02:17:47.32
Fitter or full dessert.

2843
02:17:47.32 --> 02:17:50.32
I know if you're going to be about the water kid mulk as well for the kid.

2844
02:17:50.32 --> 02:17:53.32
So that way you don't have to kid your feed your kid poison.

2845
02:17:53.32 --> 02:17:55.32
Unbeknownst to them.

2846
02:17:55.32 --> 02:17:57.32
They think you're giving them a treat.

2847
02:17:57.32 --> 02:17:58.32
Which you are.

2848
02:17:58.32 --> 02:17:59.32
Which you are.

2849
02:17:59.32 --> 02:18:00.32
An evil treat.

2850
02:18:00.32 --> 02:18:03.32
If it's filled with sugar or you can give him something that's good for you.

2851
02:18:03.32 --> 02:18:04.32
Yeah, the front end.

2852
02:18:04.32 --> 02:18:05.32
That's good for them.

2853
02:18:05.32 --> 02:18:08.32
So we're, you know, the deal with the devil, right?

2854
02:18:08.32 --> 02:18:09.32
You know, the deal with the devil.

2855
02:18:09.32 --> 02:18:10.32
That whole expression.

2856
02:18:10.32 --> 02:18:11.32
Okay.

2857
02:18:11.32 --> 02:18:12.32
So I'm like, what does that even mean?

2858
02:18:12.32 --> 02:18:13.32
That's, you know what it is.

2859
02:18:13.32 --> 02:18:14.32
It's really kind of simple.

2860
02:18:14.32 --> 02:18:16.32
And you actually essentially talk about it.

2861
02:18:16.32 --> 02:18:21.32
It's like basically you do something for a short term versus the expenses at the

2862
02:18:21.32 --> 02:18:22.32
long term.

2863
02:18:22.32 --> 02:18:24.32
The devil wants you to take the short term scenario.

2864
02:18:24.32 --> 02:18:25.32
Yeah.

2865
02:18:25.32 --> 02:18:26.32
Yeah.

2866
02:18:26.32 --> 02:18:29.32
So that's what the treats a lot of the time for the kids are.

2867
02:18:29.32 --> 02:18:30.32
To deal with the devil.

2868
02:18:30.32 --> 02:18:32.32
It's like, oh my gosh, this is so happy with you.

2869
02:18:32.32 --> 02:18:35.32
Oh my gosh, they're so, you know, they're behaving so well right now.

2870
02:18:35.32 --> 02:18:36.32
Yeah.

2871
02:18:36.32 --> 02:18:38.32
Because of the treat and they're so happy.

2872
02:18:38.32 --> 02:18:39.32
Look at their little smiles.

2873
02:18:39.32 --> 02:18:41.32
Look at their little diabetics.

2874
02:18:41.32 --> 02:18:43.32
Souls being saved by sugar.

2875
02:18:43.32 --> 02:18:44.32
No, yeah.

2876
02:18:44.32 --> 02:18:45.32
That's the devil collecting.

2877
02:18:45.32 --> 02:18:47.32
Collecting on his deal.

2878
02:18:47.32 --> 02:18:48.32
Yeah.

2879
02:18:48.32 --> 02:18:49.32
So don't do that.

2880
02:18:49.32 --> 02:18:50.32
Jocquity.

2881
02:18:50.32 --> 02:18:51.32
Yes.

2882
02:18:51.32 --> 02:18:52.32
Also, jocquity.

2883
02:18:52.32 --> 02:18:55.32
I'm into the cans more than the brew.

2884
02:18:55.32 --> 02:18:56.32
I'm into both.

2885
02:18:56.32 --> 02:18:57.32
Yeah.

2886
02:18:57.32 --> 02:18:58.32
Yeah.

2887
02:18:58.32 --> 02:18:59.32
I can see that.

2888
02:18:59.32 --> 02:19:01.32
But yeah, I'm wearing to the cans.

2889
02:19:01.32 --> 02:19:02.32
No, we can buy the way.

2890
02:19:02.32 --> 02:19:03.32
Right.

2891
02:19:03.32 --> 02:19:05.32
Also, jocquity store.

2892
02:19:05.32 --> 02:19:07.32
It's called jocquity store.

2893
02:19:07.32 --> 02:19:10.32
And this is where you can get more shirts.

2894
02:19:10.32 --> 02:19:14.32
More hoodies, beanies, rashguards, rashguards.

2895
02:19:14.32 --> 02:19:15.32
Oh yeah.

2896
02:19:15.32 --> 02:19:18.32
More representative of the path directly.

2897
02:19:18.32 --> 02:19:21.32
Indeed.

2898
02:19:21.32 --> 02:19:24.32
You're looking at me like you want me to say something else.

2899
02:19:24.32 --> 02:19:25.32
No, I'll say yes.

2900
02:19:25.32 --> 02:19:26.32
You're right.

2901
02:19:26.32 --> 02:19:27.32
Yeah.

2902
02:19:27.32 --> 02:19:29.32
Well, there you go.

2903
02:19:29.32 --> 02:19:30.32
You can do it.

2904
02:19:30.32 --> 02:19:34.32
What's funny, actually, what's funny about you saying this is when I see someone and like

2905
02:19:34.32 --> 02:19:38.32
at the live events, of course, saw a lot of people that were.

2906
02:19:38.32 --> 02:19:40.32
We're representing on the path.

2907
02:19:40.32 --> 02:19:45.32
And I would say to them, you're representing on the path.

2908
02:19:45.32 --> 02:19:46.32
Yeah.

2909
02:19:46.32 --> 02:19:50.32
So it's your little statement that you make about representing on the path.

2910
02:19:50.32 --> 02:19:55.32
Has now become part of the lexicon of the troopers.

2911
02:19:55.32 --> 02:19:56.32
Good.

2912
02:19:56.32 --> 02:19:57.32
There you go, echo Charles.

2913
02:19:57.32 --> 02:19:58.32
Well, good.

2914
02:19:58.32 --> 02:19:59.32
Yeah.

2915
02:19:59.32 --> 02:20:02.32
I feel like that sort of sort of was your contribution.

2916
02:20:02.32 --> 02:20:05.32
Pressing record and saying that.

2917
02:20:05.32 --> 02:20:06.32
The lexicon.

2918
02:20:06.32 --> 02:20:07.32
Yeah.

2919
02:20:07.32 --> 02:20:08.32
What does lexicon mean?

2920
02:20:08.32 --> 02:20:10.32
Like the verbiage, the words that we use.

2921
02:20:10.32 --> 02:20:11.32
Oh, all right.

2922
02:20:11.32 --> 02:20:12.32
Boom.

2923
02:20:12.32 --> 02:20:13.32
There you go.

2924
02:20:13.32 --> 02:20:14.32
And yes, it is always coming.

2925
02:20:14.32 --> 02:20:15.32
Let's face it, man.

2926
02:20:15.32 --> 02:20:16.32
Like you see anywhere.

2927
02:20:16.32 --> 02:20:18.32
Even at an event, you see somebody representing.

2928
02:20:18.32 --> 02:20:21.32
You're like, you know, you feel a little something.

2929
02:20:21.32 --> 02:20:22.32
There's a connection.

2930
02:20:22.32 --> 02:20:23.32
There's a connection.

2931
02:20:23.32 --> 02:20:24.32
Yeah.

2932
02:20:24.32 --> 02:20:25.32
Big time.

2933
02:20:25.32 --> 02:20:28.32
And the less jockel store.com, if you like something, get something.

2934
02:20:28.32 --> 02:20:29.32
Represent, man.

2935
02:20:29.32 --> 02:20:30.32
Represent.

2936
02:20:30.32 --> 02:20:31.32
See you in the wild.

2937
02:20:31.32 --> 02:20:32.32
Oh, recognize.

2938
02:20:32.32 --> 02:20:37.32
And if you like listening to this podcast, which if you don't, you're not hearing this right now.

2939
02:20:37.32 --> 02:20:39.32
So I guess we're just talking to the people, everyone.

2940
02:20:39.32 --> 02:20:40.32
That's listening to this right now.

2941
02:20:40.32 --> 02:20:42.32
Because if you don't like the podcast, you're not listening.

2942
02:20:42.32 --> 02:20:44.32
So if you do, subscribe to it.

2943
02:20:44.32 --> 02:20:45.32
Yes.

2944
02:20:45.32 --> 02:20:47.32
Is it important to subscribe?

2945
02:20:47.32 --> 02:20:49.32
It's not not important.

2946
02:20:49.32 --> 02:20:51.32
It's not a throwaway thing.

2947
02:20:51.32 --> 02:20:52.32
Yeah.

2948
02:20:52.32 --> 02:20:53.32
So it's some must be.

2949
02:20:53.32 --> 02:20:54.32
But yeah.

2950
02:20:54.32 --> 02:21:00.32
Let's think when you subscribe to the podcast, it's sort of like when you're a little kid and you got some new sneakers.

2951
02:21:00.32 --> 02:21:02.32
And it makes you feel a little bit faster.

2952
02:21:02.32 --> 02:21:04.32
When you actually click subscribe, you like it.

2953
02:21:04.32 --> 02:21:10.32
You know, it's a level of commitment that you're making to, you know, to the path.

2954
02:21:10.32 --> 02:21:11.32
Yeah.

2955
02:21:11.32 --> 02:21:12.32
It's more of a simple.

2956
02:21:12.32 --> 02:21:13.32
It's not.

2957
02:21:13.32 --> 02:21:14.32
It's not.

2958
02:21:14.32 --> 02:21:16.32
I feel like it's more of a symbolic commitment.

2959
02:21:16.32 --> 02:21:17.32
Because let's face it.

2960
02:21:17.32 --> 02:21:25.32
You can just you click on subscribe just as easy easily as subscribe, you know, in case like if you don't like it or whatever.

2961
02:21:25.32 --> 02:21:27.32
But you know what, functionally, no, functionally look.

2962
02:21:27.32 --> 02:21:29.32
If you live depends on where you listen to it, I get it.

2963
02:21:29.32 --> 02:21:30.32
But functionally, you click subscribe.

2964
02:21:30.32 --> 02:21:35.32
It goes into your little that little part where you don't have to do a search now or nothing like this.

2965
02:21:35.32 --> 02:21:37.32
And boom, you know, it's in your, it's in your whole thing.

2966
02:21:37.32 --> 02:21:38.32
It's part of your day.

2967
02:21:38.32 --> 02:21:40.32
Part of your life.

2968
02:21:40.32 --> 02:21:42.32
So I think I'm actually correct.

2969
02:21:42.32 --> 02:21:43.32
Yes.

2970
02:21:43.32 --> 02:21:46.32
And you're initial assessment of my statement is wrong.

2971
02:21:46.32 --> 02:21:47.32
Okay.

2972
02:21:47.32 --> 02:21:52.32
When you subscribe, you take one step further down the path.

2973
02:21:52.32 --> 02:21:53.32
That is true.

2974
02:21:53.32 --> 02:21:55.32
You're correct.

2975
02:21:55.32 --> 02:21:56.32
Cool.

2976
02:21:56.32 --> 02:21:59.32
And don't forget about the grounded podcast, which I'm sure we'll do another one.

2977
02:21:59.32 --> 02:22:04.32
And don't forget about the warrior kid podcast, which I will get some of those done.

2978
02:22:04.32 --> 02:22:07.32
And don't forget about warrior kid soap.

2979
02:22:07.32 --> 02:22:09.32
Irishoctrr ranch.com.

2980
02:22:09.32 --> 02:22:12.32
That's a warrior kid who's actually got a business going.

2981
02:22:12.32 --> 02:22:15.32
Young, young, making soap.

2982
02:22:15.32 --> 02:22:22.32
So that what week, his contribution to society, making soap so that we all can.

2983
02:22:22.32 --> 02:22:25.32
Stay clean.

2984
02:22:25.32 --> 02:22:26.32
You're correct.

2985
02:22:26.32 --> 02:22:29.32
Also YouTube for the video version of this podcast.

2986
02:22:29.32 --> 02:22:30.32
Like people watch it.

2987
02:22:30.32 --> 02:22:31.32
Makes sense.

2988
02:22:31.32 --> 02:22:37.32
In fact, you know, sometimes not all the time, but sometimes the video version will come out, you know, a half day.

2989
02:22:37.32 --> 02:22:40.32
It's a month, even a day later than the, than the audio.

2990
02:22:40.32 --> 02:22:42.32
Some people freak out about that.

2991
02:22:42.32 --> 02:22:44.32
Well, where's the YouTube?

2992
02:22:44.32 --> 02:22:45.32
Where's the wins, when's it coming out?

2993
02:22:45.32 --> 02:22:48.32
And it's kind of like, hey, no, they say wins the podcast coming out.

2994
02:22:48.32 --> 02:22:50.32
Or say, brother podcast, pin out.

2995
02:22:50.32 --> 02:22:52.32
But, and I'm like, no, you know what?

2996
02:22:52.32 --> 02:22:53.32
They like, they watch it.

2997
02:22:53.32 --> 02:22:55.32
And it makes sense too.

2998
02:22:55.32 --> 02:22:56.32
Smart TVs and whatnot.

2999
02:22:56.32 --> 02:23:01.32
And the last, we do have a YouTube channel for this method of consumption.

3000
02:23:01.32 --> 02:23:03.32
You don't tie a young tie from origin.

3001
02:23:03.32 --> 02:23:04.32
Yes, I do.

3002
02:23:04.32 --> 02:23:08.32
He, him and his friends, they like on a Friday night,

3003
02:23:08.32 --> 02:23:15.32
they're like, uh, put, put YouTube on and just watch the podcast, watch Rogan's podcast, whatever.

3004
02:23:15.32 --> 02:23:17.32
Like, that's, that's what they're doing.

3005
02:23:17.32 --> 02:23:18.32
Yeah.

3006
02:23:18.32 --> 02:23:22.32
As if they're watching UFC, but no, they're watching us talk about, you know, pat or whatever.

3007
02:23:22.32 --> 02:23:25.32
Yeah, well, and it kind of makes sense where you, when you think about it,

3008
02:23:25.32 --> 02:23:29.32
so the content lies, okay, good content is a content.

3009
02:23:29.32 --> 02:23:30.32
It's good content.

3010
02:23:30.32 --> 02:23:33.32
But to sit around and watch like remember, like old school back the day out,

3011
02:23:33.32 --> 02:23:35.32
and I'll 60 minutes, I'm sure it's still on.

3012
02:23:35.32 --> 02:23:39.32
Whatever. It's like, oh, yeah, 60 minutes special with, I don't know,

3013
02:23:39.32 --> 02:23:41.32
Michael Jordan or what, I don't know, whoever they have on there.

3014
02:23:41.32 --> 02:23:45.32
And it's just one person talking to the other person asking questions.

3015
02:23:45.32 --> 02:23:46.32
Q and A, essentially.

3016
02:23:46.32 --> 02:23:47.32
I guess people watched it.

3017
02:23:47.32 --> 02:23:48.32
Yeah, same thing.

3018
02:23:48.32 --> 02:23:49.32
Same thing.

3019
02:23:49.32 --> 02:23:51.32
It makes up the contents a little bit different.

3020
02:23:51.32 --> 02:23:52.32
Of course.

3021
02:23:52.32 --> 02:23:53.32
So that's a better.

3022
02:23:53.32 --> 02:23:55.32
I think it's better.

3023
02:23:55.32 --> 02:23:56.32
Yes.

3024
02:23:56.32 --> 02:23:59.32
You know what's, I mean, yeah, because 60 minutes, it didn't even 60 minutes.

3025
02:23:59.32 --> 02:24:01.32
Yeah, it says it's commercials in there.

3026
02:24:01.32 --> 02:24:02.32
And then there's three stories.

3027
02:24:02.32 --> 02:24:05.32
You're actually getting 12 minutes or seven minutes.

3028
02:24:05.32 --> 02:24:10.32
What can you learn about patents, theories of combat in seven minutes?

3029
02:24:10.32 --> 02:24:13.32
Just learning like maybe partially, one of them.

3030
02:24:13.32 --> 02:24:15.32
Maybe maybe maybe.

3031
02:24:15.32 --> 02:24:16.32
Maybe.

3032
02:24:16.32 --> 02:24:16.32
No doubt.

3033
02:24:16.32 --> 02:24:18.32
Now the last time keep that up.

3034
02:24:18.32 --> 02:24:19.32
And all his friends hanging with him.

3035
02:24:19.32 --> 02:24:20.32
Yeah, I mean, keep that up.

3036
02:24:20.32 --> 02:24:21.32
That's good.

3037
02:24:21.32 --> 02:24:21.32
Psycho.

3038
02:24:21.32 --> 02:24:21.32
Psycho.

3039
02:24:21.32 --> 02:24:22.32
I want to show off her.

3040
02:24:22.32 --> 02:24:23.32
Oh, yeah, YouTube channel.

3041
02:24:23.32 --> 02:24:24.32
Yeah, we have YouTube channel.

3042
02:24:24.32 --> 02:24:27.32
That was the point of my whole thing.

3043
02:24:27.32 --> 02:24:29.32
Oh, and people should subscribe to it.

3044
02:24:29.32 --> 02:24:30.32
I say they should.

3045
02:24:30.32 --> 02:24:31.32
Yeah.

3046
02:24:31.32 --> 02:24:32.32
That's the same.

3047
02:24:32.32 --> 02:24:33.32
Okay, official.

3048
02:24:33.32 --> 02:24:39.32
It is the thing that's cool is your influences what you see on your YouTube home page.

3049
02:24:39.32 --> 02:24:40.32
Which I'm.

3050
02:24:40.32 --> 02:24:42.32
Look, I have YouTube red.

3051
02:24:42.32 --> 02:24:43.32
Me too.

3052
02:24:43.32 --> 02:24:44.32
Or whatever.

3053
02:24:44.32 --> 02:24:45.32
YouTube premium.

3054
02:24:45.32 --> 02:24:46.32
Yeah.

3055
02:24:46.32 --> 02:24:47.32
They called it now.

3056
02:24:47.32 --> 02:24:48.32
You should be red.

3057
02:24:48.32 --> 02:24:49.32
I'm in school.

3058
02:24:49.32 --> 02:24:52.32
And look, I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to make Google more money by telling you to get

3059
02:24:52.32 --> 02:24:54.32
YouTube red or YouTube premium.

3060
02:24:54.32 --> 02:24:56.32
But it's nine bucks a month.

3061
02:24:56.32 --> 02:24:59.32
And you don't have to watch a single advertisement on YouTube ever again.

3062
02:24:59.32 --> 02:25:00.32
Oh, yeah, because they'll sneak up.

3063
02:25:00.32 --> 02:25:01.32
In the middle of the podcast.

3064
02:25:01.32 --> 02:25:02.32
I'll sneak up.

3065
02:25:02.32 --> 02:25:06.32
I know I saw on YouTube comments on one of our podcasts.

3066
02:25:06.32 --> 02:25:10.32
Someone said, uh, can't believe you're advertising it.

3067
02:25:10.32 --> 02:25:11.32
And I don't know.

3068
02:25:11.32 --> 02:25:13.32
Can't believe the advertising that popped up it.

3069
02:25:13.32 --> 02:25:14.32
Whatever.

3070
02:25:14.32 --> 02:25:16.32
And I said, can't believe you won't pay nine dollars a month.

3071
02:25:16.32 --> 02:25:19.32
They never have to have to watch the advertisement again.

3072
02:25:19.32 --> 02:25:21.32
Premium YouTube.

3073
02:25:21.32 --> 02:25:22.32
Yeah.

3074
02:25:22.32 --> 02:25:23.32
Worth every penny.

3075
02:25:23.32 --> 02:25:25.32
I don't show that out there either, man.

3076
02:25:25.32 --> 02:25:26.32
You know me.

3077
02:25:26.32 --> 02:25:28.32
I don't like to spend that extra money.

3078
02:25:28.32 --> 02:25:29.32
Right.

3079
02:25:29.32 --> 02:25:34.32
But it doesn't make sense because like, okay, so I have like a handfully YouTube channels.

3080
02:25:34.32 --> 02:25:35.32
Mm.

3081
02:25:35.32 --> 02:25:36.32
And they're not all premium.

3082
02:25:36.32 --> 02:25:40.32
So when I go to the other channels to do whatever and then I like whatever

3083
02:25:40.32 --> 02:25:42.32
free at the sign back in or whatever.

3084
02:25:42.32 --> 02:25:43.32
And then the commercial pop up.

3085
02:25:43.32 --> 02:25:45.32
I'm like, bro, like, you got trauma times.

3086
02:25:45.32 --> 02:25:46.32
Right.

3087
02:25:46.32 --> 02:25:47.32
It's an event.

3088
02:25:47.32 --> 02:25:48.32
It's an event.

3089
02:25:48.32 --> 02:25:49.32
Yeah.

3090
02:25:49.32 --> 02:25:52.32
That'll have to be like, I'll be one of my kids will show me something.

3091
02:25:52.32 --> 02:25:54.32
Oh, hey, watch this YouTube video.

3092
02:25:54.32 --> 02:25:56.32
And so they're like, I'll go, oh, cool.

3093
02:25:56.32 --> 02:25:57.32
Let me see.

3094
02:25:57.32 --> 02:25:58.32
And they pass me their phone or whatever.

3095
02:25:58.32 --> 02:25:59.32
Okay, play.

3096
02:25:59.32 --> 02:26:02.32
And I'll pop up some advertisement and I'll throw the phone at the wall.

3097
02:26:02.32 --> 02:26:08.32
Get a job and get YouTube premium anyways.

3098
02:26:08.32 --> 02:26:11.32
Don't forget about psychological warfare.

3099
02:26:11.32 --> 02:26:13.32
I tunes Google play and be three platforms.

Kids are scared.

3124
02:27:17.32 --> 02:27:19.32
The world is a horrible place.

3125
02:27:19.32 --> 02:27:22.32

Talking about the principles that we learned in combat and how you can apply them.

3132
02:27:35.32 --> 02:27:37.32
Into your business and into your life.

3133
02:27:37.32 --> 02:27:39.32
Two.

3134
02:27:39.32 --> 02:27:44.32

02:27:53.32 --> 02:27:56.32
So go to echelon front dot com for details on that.

3140
02:27:56.32 --> 02:27:58.32

Leadership training is non-noculation.

3142
02:28:00.32 --> 02:28:02.32
You need to follow up.

3143
02:28:02.32 --> 02:28:04.32
You need to drill.

3144
02:28:04.32 --> 02:28:08.32
And the way you do that is with eF online dot com.

3145
02:28:08.32 --> 02:28:10.32

There's three from this year.

3152
02:28:26.32 --> 02:28:28.32
Everyone that we've ever done has sold out.

3153
02:28:28.32 --> 02:28:31.32
These are going to sell out to and once they sell out, you can't come.

3154
02:28:31.32 --> 02:28:33.32
And there's nothing we can do about it.

3155
02:28:33.32 --> 02:28:37.32
We can't like we have the space and then it sells out.

3156
02:28:37.32 --> 02:28:39.32
There's no more space.

3157
02:28:39.32 --> 02:28:41.32
So if you want to come go to extremotorship dot com.

3158
02:28:41.32 --> 02:28:43.32
And then EF overwatch and EF.

3159
02:28:43.32 --> 02:28:44.32

That know how to win and know how to lead and understand extremotorship.

3162

Therein.

3164
02:28:53.32 --> 02:28:54.32
Then go to EF.

3165
02:28:54.32 --> 02:28:56.32
EF Legion or EF overwatch.

3166
02:28:56.32 --> 02:29:00.32
And if you are a military veteran.

3167
02:29:00.32 --> 02:29:04.32
Transitioning out of the military and transitioning into your next mission.

3168
02:29:04.32 --> 02:29:06.32
Go to EF overwatch or EF Legion.

3169
02:29:06.32 --> 02:29:12.32
And we will connect you with the company that is awaiting for you to come and lead.

3170
02:29:12.32 --> 02:29:15.32
And if you want to hear more.

3171
02:29:15.32 --> 02:29:18.32
From Eko Charles.

3172
02:29:18.32 --> 02:29:19.32
If you want to hear more from me.

3173
02:29:19.32 --> 02:29:22.32
If you have a question, a comment and answer.

3174
02:29:22.32 --> 02:29:28.32
Then you can get in touch with us through the interwebs on Twitter, on Instagram.

3175
02:29:28.32 --> 02:29:31.32
And on the face.

3176
02:29:31.32 --> 02:29:32.32
Hulk.

3177
02:29:32.32 --> 02:29:39.32
Eko is at Eko Charles and I am at Jocca Willink and thanks to everyone for listening to this podcast.

3178
02:29:39.32 --> 02:29:44.32
A podcast that would not be possible without your.

3179
02:29:44.32 --> 02:29:46.32
Is that a part?

3180
02:29:46.32 --> 02:29:47.32
So thanks for listening.

3181
02:29:47.32 --> 02:29:50.32
And thanks for spreading the word and thanks for telling your friends.

3182
02:29:50.32 --> 02:29:54.32
And thanks for getting some deaf core gear or some origin gear.

3183
02:29:54.32 --> 02:29:59.32
All of which supports the podcast.

3184
02:29:59.32 --> 02:30:04.32
Well, and of course, the true reason for this podcast.

3185
02:30:04.32 --> 02:30:07.32
Existence is because of the safety and security.

3186
02:30:07.32 --> 02:30:13.32
We receive from the soldiers sailors, airmen and marines who defend us with their very lives.

3187
02:30:13.32 --> 02:30:18.32
So thanks to all of you and to our police and law enforcement, our firefighters and paramedics,

3188
02:30:18.32 --> 02:30:23.32
our EMTs and dispatchers, our correctional officers and border patrol and secret service.

3189
02:30:23.32 --> 02:30:29.32
And all of you first responders, you also.

3190
02:30:29.32 --> 02:30:32.32
Provide us with safety and security.

3191
02:30:32.32 --> 02:30:37.32
And we thank you for that and to everyone else out there.

3192
02:30:37.32 --> 02:30:49.32
Remember, remember that like what Pat and said, all heroes are not story book combat fighters.

3193
02:30:49.32 --> 02:30:56.32
No, every single man plays a vital role.

3194
02:30:56.32 --> 02:30:58.32
Everybody has a job to do.

3195
02:30:58.32 --> 02:31:01.32
Every man is a vital link in a great chain.

3196
02:31:01.32 --> 02:31:04.32
Every man does his job.

3197
02:31:04.32 --> 02:31:09.32
Every thing that the job that you're doing is unimportant.

3198
02:31:09.32 --> 02:31:12.32
You're playing a role.

3199
02:31:12.32 --> 02:31:21.32
And Pat makes it clear that when you're doing your job, the key is don't ever let up.

3200
02:31:21.32 --> 02:31:24.32
Don't ever let up.

3201
02:31:24.32 --> 02:31:33.32
Instead, every minute of every day, go out there and get after it.

3202
02:31:33.32 --> 02:31:40.32
And until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.
