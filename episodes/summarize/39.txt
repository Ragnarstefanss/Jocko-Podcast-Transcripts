Yeah, that, that, that, that, that, when you think about that, like the engineers in a war zone, right, it's not like compared to like an MMA fight right, the cut man, where he's like facilitating all these things, giving water whatever, but that's between rounds. I don't think like you know other times less there they're asking specifically so like my daughter she's three and half now she's kind of like a bigger three and half to and she comes runs up wakes me up a lot of times and is like hey carry me downstairs so when I sit up she jumps on my back.
