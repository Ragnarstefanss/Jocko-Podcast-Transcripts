00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 220 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willing. Good evening echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Three hours passed by slowly and the terrible news had been heralded by the few frustrated medical staff members walking out of the tent stressed out.

3
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Three of the wounded did not make it. And the word was passed that it was time for us to perform our job and the sinking feeling and the pit of my belly fell into the sea.

4
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We tripped over ourselves trying to get up several of our Marines volunteered as litter bearers and several of us quickly cleared our sleeping area to make room for the processing.

5
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Our sleeping area was out in the open and people who were passing by could see in through the camo netting. So a couple of our Marines were signed to each end to ensure that discretion was maintained.

6
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The only sounds that could be heard were the not so distant generator and the swaying of the camo netting in the light breeze.

7
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:38.000
In earnest under incandescent lights watching our fellow M.A. Marines carrying the remains of our fallen brothers in and lowered them on to the sandy floor of our sleeping area.

8
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It was out of reverence that no one spoke.

9
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The sound of a heavy zipper being opened on each bag was deafening.

10
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And the confused emotions began to whirl inside my soul.

11
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The female chaplain assigned to the STP followed the procession in and watched our Marines begin the processing.

12
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And she leaned over to whisper to one of our teammates.

13
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You guys have a very tough job.

14
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Very tough.

15
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.000
The first was a Hispanic staff sergeant who was assigned to a tank battalion and it succumbed to his wounds sustained in a firefight outside of Baghdad.

16
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:46.000
The second was a Caucasian Lance Corporal, the same one who three hours prior, I had helped carry off the helicopter.

17
00:02:46.000 --> 00:03:01.000
His fingers were still wrenched together just as he had done earlier as he arrived in pain and the tracks of his tears were still visible.

18
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:14.000
When the zipper of the third bag was undone, it revealed an individual whose whole head had been bandaged and thick bloody gauze.

19
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I thought to myself, how can that guy breathe through all that gauze?

20
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Then it dawned on me and I felt stupid.

21
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
He was dead.

22
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And the medical staff had bandaged his head to keep all the pieces in.

23
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:50.000
One by one the paperwork was filled out. The personal effects were catalogued and the transportation was arranged to take our fallen south to Kuwait.

24
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
We had completed our work, but there was still something missing.

25
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
We wanted to do more for these guys.

26
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Someone had asked the chaplain to lead us in prayer and she did.

27
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So under the glow of the incandescent lights and swaying camo netting, all 23 of us stood in a circle around our brothers and bowed our heads in solemn prayer.

28
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I felt bad to know that a world away from here, the families of these men were praying that those who lay before us were safe that night.

29
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And it ripped out my heart to know the truth.

30
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I hope that God could provide them comfort and strengthen the terrible news, traveled to meet them unaware.

31
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000
The chaplain quietly notes in front of each stretcher and performed a last-right prayer according to each of their individual denominations.

32
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And she put the sign of the cross on their foreheads with ash and it meant the world to meet a witness it.

33
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Our volunteers transported their remains to the flight line to be evacuated out of Iraq and to Kuwait by C130 Hercules cargo plane.

34
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:34.000
From there they would be placed inside an aluminum mobile coffin called a transfer case. And an American flag would be placed onto it before they would chase the son across the globe and land in the United States.

35
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
It was a tough night. The first time I had ever seen deceased servicemen.

36
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And as much as I had prepared myself mentally and physically for the job, I had never prepared myself emotionally.

37
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I kept thinking about those guys. The scenes kept playing over and over in my head.

38
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I felt terrible for them and for their families.

39
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
What a huge loss.

40
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I couldn't sleep. So I sat on a broken piece of concrete, stared off into nothing and smoked my cigarettes down to the filter all alone.

41
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And that is an excerpt from a book called No Tuffer Duty, No Greater Honor by Gunnery Sergeant L. Christian Bustler.

42
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And you've heard me say before that the nature of war is death.

43
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
It's one of the things I said when I retired from the Navy.

44
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And I get it that there are an infinite number of other dynamics in war.

45
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000
There's strategy and tactics. There's manpower and logistics. There's hearts and minds.

46
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:24.000
There's technology and weapons. There's leadership. There's human nature. And the list goes on and on.

47
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000
But one thing is always present in war.

48
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And that is death.

49
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
But death does not end on the battlefield.

50
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:53.96
And in fact, the finality of one life and combat unleashes a chain of events that profoundly and forever impacts countless

51
00:07:53.96 --> 00:07:58.96
other lives.

52
00:07:58.96 --> 00:08:12.96
It impacts the members of a unit, the unit who lost their comrades in arms, who still must carry on with their mission.

53
00:08:12.96 --> 00:08:18.96
And that's an incredibly heavy impact.

54
00:08:18.96 --> 00:08:36.96
But on top of that and even heavier it impacts the mothers and fathers and the husband's wives and the sons and daughters.

55
00:08:36.96 --> 00:08:47.96
The families and friends of the fallen death has a monumental impact.

56
00:08:47.96 --> 00:08:58.96
And in war, those of us who are in it experience death more than normal civilians do.

57
00:08:58.96 --> 00:09:08.96
Most of us from the military have been more funerals and memorial services than we care to remember.

58
00:09:08.96 --> 00:09:18.96
And depending on your specific job inside the military, you may experience death more or less often.

59
00:09:18.96 --> 00:09:23.96
If you're an infantry soldier, then you're going to experience more death than a supply curve.

60
00:09:23.96 --> 00:09:39.96
But there's one military job that deals with death more than any other.

61
00:09:39.96 --> 00:09:44.96
And that is mortuary affairs.

62
00:09:44.96 --> 00:09:55.96
Those military members who are charged with handling our fallen service members.

63
00:09:55.96 --> 00:10:01.96
And that was Gunnery Sergeant Bustler's duty.

64
00:10:01.96 --> 00:10:07.96
And as the title of the book indicates, there is no tougher duty.

65
00:10:07.96 --> 00:10:19.96
And there is no greater honor than ensuring our heroic service members who have given their last full measure.

66
00:10:19.96 --> 00:10:32.96
Our sent home with as much care and respect and honor as they deserve.

67
00:10:32.96 --> 00:10:43.96
And it is an honor to have Gunny Bustler here with us now to share some of his experiences.

68
00:10:43.96 --> 00:10:52.96
What he saw, what he went through and what he learned.

69
00:10:52.96 --> 00:10:56.96
Gunny.

70
00:10:56.96 --> 00:10:58.96
Thanks for coming on, honey.

71
00:10:58.96 --> 00:11:09.96
Thank you so much for having me. It is a deep and profound honor to be able to sit here at this table with you guys.

72
00:11:09.96 --> 00:11:16.96
And bring to light an MOS that's very not well-known.

73
00:11:16.96 --> 00:11:23.96
And to bring the light to different sacrifices of the guys who did this job.

74
00:11:23.96 --> 00:11:30.96
And as I was writing the part I was thinking about the fact that who deals the most with death.

75
00:11:30.96 --> 00:11:33.96
And obviously you think of an infantry soldier.

76
00:11:33.96 --> 00:11:36.96
You know, you're going to see a lot of it.

77
00:11:36.96 --> 00:11:38.96
And then I thought about medical.

78
00:11:38.96 --> 00:11:44.96
Obviously the medics, the corpsmen, the doctors, the surgeons that are out there.

79
00:11:44.96 --> 00:11:46.96
They're going to see a ton of it too.

80
00:11:46.96 --> 00:11:50.96
But the big difference is they get to see the other side of the spectrum.

81
00:11:50.96 --> 00:11:55.96
There's even people's lives. There's someone that they can pull through.

82
00:11:55.96 --> 00:12:03.96
And I would only think that that would counteract the difference between being in more to wary of fairs.

83
00:12:03.96 --> 00:12:09.96
Where you don't see any of that.

84
00:12:09.96 --> 00:12:14.96
There's nothing motivating to do with our job.

85
00:12:14.96 --> 00:12:23.96
Because if you work in the medical field, you do your best and ensure that guy will get home.

86
00:12:23.96 --> 00:12:26.96
And have a normal life.

87
00:12:26.96 --> 00:12:31.96
You've read it with the grunts, you know, train, train, train, try to prepare yourself.

88
00:12:31.96 --> 00:12:37.96
But for us, we never know where we're going to get until we open the bag.

89
00:12:37.96 --> 00:12:44.96
And then we have to wear so many different hats. The, you know, between processing remains.

90
00:12:44.96 --> 00:12:47.96
And then we're dealing with and working with there.

91
00:12:47.96 --> 00:12:53.96
They're unit members and taking, you know, their statements.

92
00:12:53.96 --> 00:12:59.96
And so you have to play the role of a like a funeral director and the.

93
00:12:59.96 --> 00:13:03.96
And it's so hard to remove yourself from that.

94
00:13:03.96 --> 00:13:08.96
Because you may recognize that person you're working on from the, the child hall.

95
00:13:08.96 --> 00:13:13.96
Or you know that guy, you know, and that had to happen to us several times.

96
00:13:13.96 --> 00:13:17.96
And that's where it really, really sucks.

97
00:13:17.96 --> 00:13:21.96
So let's, let's start off and figure out how you got there.

98
00:13:21.96 --> 00:13:22.96
Okay.

99
00:13:22.96 --> 00:13:25.96
So you were born where, you know, high on.

100
00:13:25.96 --> 00:13:28.96
Oh, I was born in Mount Holly, New Jersey.

101
00:13:28.96 --> 00:13:29.96
Okay.

102
00:13:29.96 --> 00:13:33.96
And your dad was a event he was Air Force. Okay.

103
00:13:33.96 --> 00:13:37.96
I grew up in the Air Force, traveled all over the world.

104
00:13:37.96 --> 00:13:39.96
I spent 70 years in Japan.

105
00:13:39.96 --> 00:13:46.96
When we left there, we went and visited some friends over in Clark Air Force base over in.

106
00:13:46.96 --> 00:13:49.96
In Philippines, New big bay went back to Thailand.

107
00:13:49.96 --> 00:13:51.96
So how old are you at these times?

108
00:13:51.96 --> 00:13:52.96
Wow.

109
00:13:52.96 --> 00:13:54.96
So your dad was in the Air Force.

110
00:13:54.96 --> 00:13:55.96
You were a kid.

111
00:13:55.96 --> 00:13:57.96
You were going to your station to Japan.

112
00:13:57.96 --> 00:13:59.96
You were traveling around. You were a military brat.

113
00:13:59.96 --> 00:14:00.96
Yes.

114
00:14:00.96 --> 00:14:02.96
As they call, I thought everybody was that.

115
00:14:02.96 --> 00:14:05.96
You know, I thought everybody, to be an American, you had to be the military.

116
00:14:05.96 --> 00:14:11.96
And I had no idea that there was a civilian world until I came back when we were 10 years old.

117
00:14:11.96 --> 00:14:14.96
And we moved straight into South Carolina.

118
00:14:14.96 --> 00:14:19.96
And I'm like, wow, there's actually people who don't, you know, run and work out.

119
00:14:19.96 --> 00:14:20.96
And what was your job?

120
00:14:20.96 --> 00:14:21.96
What was your dad's job?

121
00:14:21.96 --> 00:14:22.96
I was a force.

122
00:14:22.96 --> 00:14:22.96
Yeah.

123
00:14:22.96 --> 00:14:28.96
He was a P.O.L. so he refueled airplanes. He spent three tours in the Vietnam War where he met married my mom.

124
00:14:28.96 --> 00:14:35.96
But back then he was making, you know, he said he used to make Napalm and stuff like that.

125
00:14:35.96 --> 00:14:36.96
And your mom's tie.

126
00:14:36.96 --> 00:14:37.96
Yep.

127
00:14:37.96 --> 00:14:38.96
Yeah.

128
00:14:38.96 --> 00:14:39.96
They met married.

129
00:14:39.96 --> 00:14:41.96
She immigrated here.

130
00:14:41.96 --> 00:14:43.96
Had had me and my two brothers.

131
00:14:43.96 --> 00:14:44.96
Yep.

132
00:14:44.96 --> 00:14:46.96
And so where'd you do your growing up?

133
00:14:46.96 --> 00:14:48.96
So when you moved back to the States, where'd you move to?

134
00:14:48.96 --> 00:14:51.96
We moved South Carolina for like three or four years.

135
00:14:51.96 --> 00:14:53.96
Then we moved to Illinois for a year.

136
00:14:53.96 --> 00:14:55.96
Then we moved to Ohio.

137
00:14:55.96 --> 00:14:59.96
My dad found a job as a contractor at Wright Patterson Air Force Base.

138
00:14:59.96 --> 00:15:01.96
He was there for a few years.

139
00:15:01.96 --> 00:15:04.96
They lost the contract during the Clinton years.

140
00:15:04.96 --> 00:15:07.96
And then he got a job as a mailman.

141
00:15:07.96 --> 00:15:11.96
And I went to high school out there, graduated.

142
00:15:11.96 --> 00:15:14.96
And that's what led me to joining the reserves.

143
00:15:14.96 --> 00:15:17.96
The Marine reserves because I traveled as a kid.

144
00:15:17.96 --> 00:15:21.96
And I never had friends beyond three years, four years.

145
00:15:21.96 --> 00:15:23.96
And I didn't want that.

146
00:15:23.96 --> 00:15:28.96
I finally had a place where I had low, you know, I loved my hanging out with my friends.

147
00:15:28.96 --> 00:15:32.96
And so after I joined the reserves, they were like, hey,

148
00:15:32.96 --> 00:15:34.96
So how'd you pick the Marine Corps?

149
00:15:34.96 --> 00:15:36.96
Because I grew up in the Air Force.

150
00:15:36.96 --> 00:15:41.96
And we would always watch the War movies,

151
00:15:41.96 --> 00:15:46.96
cartoon and you know, and full metal jacket and we're like, oh man, that's awesome.

152
00:15:46.96 --> 00:15:48.96
How cool would it be to go shoot a 50 cow?

153
00:15:48.96 --> 00:15:49.96
I don't know.

154
00:15:49.96 --> 00:15:52.96
It would be to, you know, this shoot them 16s all day long.

155
00:15:52.96 --> 00:15:54.96
And you know, and, and, and, and,

156
00:15:54.96 --> 00:15:57.96
But I just want your dad think when you're doing the Marine Corps.

157
00:15:57.96 --> 00:15:58.96
He didn't like it.

158
00:15:58.96 --> 00:15:59.96
Mm-hmm.

159
00:15:59.96 --> 00:16:00.96
Was he didn't like the Marine Corps?

160
00:16:00.96 --> 00:16:02.96
Did he not like anything?

161
00:16:02.96 --> 00:16:06.96
Or was it just, hey, I did this or you don't have to.

162
00:16:06.96 --> 00:16:07.96
No, it was.

163
00:16:07.96 --> 00:16:10.96
He knew that it was something I wanted to do.

164
00:16:10.96 --> 00:16:12.96
But he was very cautious about it.

165
00:16:12.96 --> 00:16:18.96
He said, I, when I was a kid, when I was over in Vietnam in Thailand,

166
00:16:18.96 --> 00:16:24.96
I remember seeing a lot of those body bags getting loaded up on the helicopters and the planes.

167
00:16:24.96 --> 00:16:27.96
And I don't want you becoming one of them.

168
00:16:27.96 --> 00:16:31.96
And I told him, like, Dad, if I died doing something that wanted to do,

169
00:16:31.96 --> 00:16:34.96
I died doing something I wanted to do.

170
00:16:34.96 --> 00:16:36.96
And so he signed for me.

171
00:16:36.96 --> 00:16:38.96
I signed when I was 17 years old.

172
00:16:38.96 --> 00:16:42.96
And I knew I wanted to go in and I never thought we would ever go to war.

173
00:16:42.96 --> 00:16:43.96
I just wanted to go.

174
00:16:43.96 --> 00:16:44.96
What year was every year?

175
00:16:44.96 --> 00:16:45.96
I used to 92.

176
00:16:45.96 --> 00:16:46.96
1992.

177
00:16:46.96 --> 00:16:47.96
Yeah.

178
00:16:47.96 --> 00:16:50.96
You, did you just graduate from high school?

179
00:16:50.96 --> 00:16:53.96
Or did you go in between your junior and your senior year to become?

180
00:16:53.96 --> 00:16:56.96
No, I, I signed when I was still in my senior year.

181
00:16:56.96 --> 00:17:01.96
And then I was on a debt program and I went in November of 1992.

182
00:17:01.96 --> 00:17:03.96
And graduated February of 93.

183
00:17:03.96 --> 00:17:05.96
And you, enlisted in the reserves.

184
00:17:05.96 --> 00:17:06.96
Mm-hmm.

185
00:17:06.96 --> 00:17:09.96
And so when you enlisted in the reserves, you go to boot camp.

186
00:17:09.96 --> 00:17:11.96
And then you go to AI, or what school of infantry?

187
00:17:11.96 --> 00:17:12.96
The school of infantry.

188
00:17:12.96 --> 00:17:18.96
There, back then we did a Marine Combat Training, which is a four week condensed course of,

189
00:17:18.96 --> 00:17:22.96
you know, we're going to do humps and we're going to go out and shoot things.

190
00:17:22.96 --> 00:17:28.96
And then we're after that, when we separate the people who were doing, like,

191
00:17:28.96 --> 00:17:32.96
admin jobs, they would go away, you know, and they would go to their other school.

192
00:17:32.96 --> 00:17:37.96
But we would do the seatback drag from one side of Geiger to the other side of Geiger.

193
00:17:37.96 --> 00:17:41.96
And then, you know, from there we'd start our infantry.

194
00:17:41.96 --> 00:17:44.96
So I joined up as an O3-11 rifleman.

195
00:17:44.96 --> 00:17:47.96
I didn't really understand what it was.

196
00:17:47.96 --> 00:17:49.96
I said, no one else, a high school.

197
00:17:49.96 --> 00:17:51.96
You know, I was like, oh, I get to go shoot things.

198
00:17:51.96 --> 00:17:56.96
I didn't really know about all the running and all the, you know, hundred pound packs

199
00:17:56.96 --> 00:17:59.96
and, you know, going out for 27 miles and stuff like that.

200
00:17:59.96 --> 00:18:02.96
But I was like, I want to shoot a 50-k'o.

201
00:18:02.96 --> 00:18:03.96
All right, cool.

202
00:18:03.96 --> 00:18:05.96
All right, now you got to clean it.

203
00:18:05.96 --> 00:18:10.96
You know, I never, they never put that into the advertisements, do they cleaning weapons?

204
00:18:10.96 --> 00:18:12.96
Fund issued a pain to clean.

205
00:18:12.96 --> 00:18:14.96
Did you play any sports that got you ready for this?

206
00:18:14.96 --> 00:18:15.96
I didn't.

207
00:18:15.96 --> 00:18:17.96
We traveled so much to kid.

208
00:18:17.96 --> 00:18:21.96
And I never really stayed in one spot for too long.

209
00:18:21.96 --> 00:18:26.96
And growing up and having that mother that's tied,

210
00:18:26.96 --> 00:18:30.96
I felt more trying to find my connection to my roots.

211
00:18:30.96 --> 00:18:36.96
And I grew up knowing about my uncle who fought in Moetai.

212
00:18:36.96 --> 00:18:39.96
And so, by the time we settled down in Ohio,

213
00:18:39.96 --> 00:18:44.96
met some people in the tire forces before Moetai was anything.

214
00:18:44.96 --> 00:18:46.96
And I started going to the backyard.

215
00:18:46.96 --> 00:18:50.96
He started training me on some stuff that I had no idea.

216
00:18:50.96 --> 00:18:51.96
It was so cool.

217
00:18:51.96 --> 00:18:55.96
And then from there, I just went straight into the Marine Corps.

218
00:18:55.96 --> 00:18:59.96
The only thing that I would really say that I would prepare for it was

219
00:18:59.96 --> 00:19:00.96
Bailing Hey.

220
00:19:00.96 --> 00:19:02.96
You'll pick it up, you know,

221
00:19:02.96 --> 00:19:05.96
Bails a hay thrown up from sun up to sun down.

222
00:19:05.96 --> 00:19:08.96
And the guy was driving the tractor was a former Marine.

223
00:19:08.96 --> 00:19:11.96
He was like, you got to work faster than this.

224
00:19:11.96 --> 00:19:16.96
And then so you get done with with boot camp and S.A.Y.

225
00:19:16.96 --> 00:19:17.96
And what does that take?

226
00:19:17.96 --> 00:19:19.96
Like six months something like that?

227
00:19:19.96 --> 00:19:20.96
Something like that.

228
00:19:20.96 --> 00:19:24.96
And then you're done with your Marine Corps indoctrination, right?

229
00:19:24.96 --> 00:19:27.96
And now it's back to the Sanchezus,

230
00:19:27.96 --> 00:19:28.96
to the Sanchezus, to the land sector.

231
00:19:28.96 --> 00:19:31.96
I checked into my unit, which was MP company.

232
00:19:31.96 --> 00:19:34.96
They had a small detachment of reinforced,

233
00:19:34.96 --> 00:19:37.96
which was basically most of this were grunts.

234
00:19:37.96 --> 00:19:39.96
And at the time, they were like, hey,

235
00:19:39.96 --> 00:19:42.96
you're something called gravesplotin.

236
00:19:42.96 --> 00:19:43.96
I don't want you.

237
00:19:43.96 --> 00:19:44.96
Okay.

238
00:19:44.96 --> 00:19:45.96
What does that mean?

239
00:19:45.96 --> 00:19:47.96
You're supposed to handle remains and more.

240
00:19:47.96 --> 00:19:49.96
I'm like, well, I didn't join up for that.

241
00:19:49.96 --> 00:19:51.96
I don't want it to be a grunt.

242
00:19:51.96 --> 00:19:54.96
And it's like, well, I'm not supposed to stay here,

243
00:19:54.96 --> 00:19:56.96
because we're not going to go to war.

244
00:19:56.96 --> 00:19:59.96
I had a beat or car anyway, and if I was a driving warehouse,

245
00:19:59.96 --> 00:20:02.96
it would look good like getting there.

246
00:20:02.96 --> 00:20:05.96
So yeah, I stayed with that unit.

247
00:20:05.96 --> 00:20:09.96
It's a graceful tune, eventually turned into more jewelry affairs.

248
00:20:09.96 --> 00:20:13.96
And that's how I ended up being in that unit.

249
00:20:13.96 --> 00:20:16.96
And then what were you doing for a civilian job?

250
00:20:16.96 --> 00:20:18.96
I bounced around from being in like,

251
00:20:18.96 --> 00:20:22.96
I'm a security unit.

252
00:20:22.96 --> 00:20:24.96
I worked for a couple department stores.

253
00:20:24.96 --> 00:20:27.96
I ended up working in, you know,

254
00:20:27.96 --> 00:20:28.96
for low security.

255
00:20:28.96 --> 00:20:32.96
And then I applied for every police job that I could.

256
00:20:32.96 --> 00:20:36.96
So it's a date and PD, Anguad, and Beaver Creek.

257
00:20:36.96 --> 00:20:38.96
And next thing I know, my dad said, hey,

258
00:20:38.96 --> 00:20:40.96
the post offices, going to be hiring.

259
00:20:40.96 --> 00:20:41.96
Like, oh, sure.

260
00:20:41.96 --> 00:20:43.96
I'll go ahead and take that test.

261
00:20:43.96 --> 00:20:46.96
And I got to call back from them.

262
00:20:46.96 --> 00:20:48.96
I was like, awesome. I got to work with my dad.

263
00:20:48.96 --> 00:20:50.96
Because me and my dad, when we were growing up,

264
00:20:50.96 --> 00:20:51.96
you know, he was always yelling at me.

265
00:20:51.96 --> 00:20:53.96
I was the knucklehead, you know,

266
00:20:53.96 --> 00:20:54.96
I'm not listening to him.

267
00:20:54.96 --> 00:20:56.96
I'm sneak out on my window,

268
00:20:56.96 --> 00:20:58.96
go hang out on my friends, kind of thing at night.

269
00:20:58.96 --> 00:21:03.96
And here, I got to work with my dad,

270
00:21:03.96 --> 00:21:05.96
and I got to know him in a totally different light.

271
00:21:05.96 --> 00:21:10.96
You know, more of a man demand and not as a father and son.

272
00:21:10.96 --> 00:21:13.96
And we came really good friends.

273
00:21:13.96 --> 00:21:17.96
And I really, really loved hanging out with them.

274
00:21:17.96 --> 00:21:22.96
And going to work with them in the morning and waiting on him at night.

275
00:21:22.96 --> 00:21:25.96
Stuffed, he'd always have a cup of coffee waiting for me in the morning.

276
00:21:25.96 --> 00:21:27.96
And my mom would fix me a, you know,

277
00:21:27.96 --> 00:21:30.96
a little breakfast sandwich and a aluminum foil.

278
00:21:30.96 --> 00:21:32.96
And so it's really cool.

279
00:21:32.96 --> 00:21:35.96
And I really look finally upon those days.

280
00:21:35.96 --> 00:21:37.96
And then you're doing, um,

281
00:21:37.96 --> 00:21:39.96
you missed the first call for.

282
00:21:39.96 --> 00:21:42.96
And so what's your drill consist of?

283
00:21:42.96 --> 00:21:44.96
One weekend a month, two weeks in the summertime.

284
00:21:44.96 --> 00:21:45.96
Week in the month.

285
00:21:45.96 --> 00:21:46.96
Just as advertised.

286
00:21:46.96 --> 00:21:47.96
Right.

287
00:21:47.96 --> 00:21:49.96
Um, and every once in a while,

288
00:21:49.96 --> 00:21:51.96
they might have another school pop up.

289
00:21:51.96 --> 00:21:53.96
And by the time I picked up corporal,

290
00:21:53.96 --> 00:21:54.96
and sergeant, I was like, yeah,

291
00:21:54.96 --> 00:21:56.96
I want to do two of these a year.

292
00:21:56.96 --> 00:21:58.96
One do get my official, like,

293
00:21:58.96 --> 00:22:00.96
sergeant's course out of the way.

294
00:22:00.96 --> 00:22:04.96
But then I want to go out to Bridgeport at California and, you know,

295
00:22:04.96 --> 00:22:06.96
snow ski and climb,

296
00:22:06.96 --> 00:22:08.96
and I love that stuff.

297
00:22:08.96 --> 00:22:11.96
Go to Norway and go out there and see the,

298
00:22:11.96 --> 00:22:13.96
Aurora borealis,

299
00:22:13.96 --> 00:22:15.96
you know, they always like, man,

300
00:22:15.96 --> 00:22:16.96
this is so awesome.

301
00:22:16.96 --> 00:22:17.96
I love this stuff.

302
00:22:17.96 --> 00:22:19.96
Did they train you in any of the graves,

303
00:22:19.96 --> 00:22:20.96
platoon, stuff at this time?

304
00:22:20.96 --> 00:22:21.96
No.

305
00:22:21.96 --> 00:22:23.96
This is funny.

306
00:22:23.96 --> 00:22:25.96
Um, nobody updated it.

307
00:22:25.96 --> 00:22:26.96
Nobody updated it.

308
00:22:26.96 --> 00:22:27.96
Nobody updated it.

309
00:22:27.96 --> 00:22:29.96
Manuals from World War II.

310
00:22:29.96 --> 00:22:31.96
So we were practicing stuff that were World War II,

311
00:22:31.96 --> 00:22:32.96
tenings.

312
00:22:32.96 --> 00:22:34.96
Um, all the, all the stuff,

313
00:22:34.96 --> 00:22:37.96
the diagrams on the inside was like,

314
00:22:37.96 --> 00:22:39.96
an old airplane, like,

315
00:22:39.96 --> 00:22:40.96
like a bomber or something.

316
00:22:40.96 --> 00:22:42.96
If they were crashing,

317
00:22:42.96 --> 00:22:44.96
you would have these big pieces and stuff.

318
00:22:44.96 --> 00:22:45.96
And, you know,

319
00:22:45.96 --> 00:22:48.96
and they will talk about if you clean out a tank,

320
00:22:48.96 --> 00:22:50.96
which back then Sherman tanks,

321
00:22:50.96 --> 00:22:51.96
all steel,

322
00:22:51.96 --> 00:22:52.96
they blow up stuff,

323
00:22:52.96 --> 00:22:54.96
everything's usually contained on there.

324
00:22:54.96 --> 00:22:55.96
But, you know,

325
00:22:55.96 --> 00:22:58.96
and that's how we thought it was going to be.

326
00:22:58.96 --> 00:22:59.96
But it was mostly,

327
00:22:59.96 --> 00:23:02.96
focusing on infantry skills.

328
00:23:02.96 --> 00:23:04.96
So we would do a lot of patrolling.

329
00:23:04.96 --> 00:23:07.96
And we would patrolling to an area.

330
00:23:07.96 --> 00:23:09.96
That's when we set up a perimeter.

331
00:23:09.96 --> 00:23:12.96
And then we would do a quick cleanup.

332
00:23:12.96 --> 00:23:13.96
Somebody's like,

333
00:23:13.96 --> 00:23:14.96
all right,

334
00:23:14.96 --> 00:23:14.96
do you three guys,

335
00:23:14.96 --> 00:23:15.96
you're dead.

336
00:23:15.96 --> 00:23:16.96
Get on the letters.

337
00:23:16.96 --> 00:23:18.96
We're going to carry you back then.

338
00:23:18.96 --> 00:23:19.96
That kind of thing.

339
00:23:19.96 --> 00:23:21.96
We really didn't know how to prepare for war.

340
00:23:21.96 --> 00:23:22.96
And do our jobs.

341
00:23:22.96 --> 00:23:23.96
You know?

342
00:23:23.96 --> 00:23:25.96
Nobody had to see anything like this

343
00:23:25.96 --> 00:23:26.96
since Vietnam,

344
00:23:26.96 --> 00:23:27.96
but nobody wrote it down.

345
00:23:27.96 --> 00:23:28.96
Yeah, that was the 90s.

346
00:23:28.96 --> 00:23:29.96
That was the 90s.

347
00:23:29.96 --> 00:23:30.96
That was the 90s.

348
00:23:30.96 --> 00:23:30.96
That was the 90s.

349
00:23:30.96 --> 00:23:30.96
That was the 90s.

350
00:23:30.96 --> 00:23:30.96
That was the 90s.

351
00:23:30.96 --> 00:23:31.96
That was the 90s.

352
00:23:31.96 --> 00:23:32.96
That was the 90s.

353
00:23:32.96 --> 00:23:33.96
That was the 90s.

354
00:23:33.96 --> 00:23:34.96
That was the 90s.

355
00:23:34.96 --> 00:23:34.96
That was the 90s.

356
00:23:34.96 --> 00:23:35.96
That was the 90s.

357
00:23:35.96 --> 00:23:35.96
That was the 90s.

358
00:23:35.96 --> 00:23:36.96
That was the 90s.

359
00:23:36.96 --> 00:23:38.96
That was the 90s.

360
00:23:38.96 --> 00:23:39.96
That was the 90s,

361
00:23:39.96 --> 00:23:40.96
that was the 90s.

362
00:23:40.96 --> 00:23:41.96
That was the 90s.

363
00:23:41.96 --> 00:23:42.96
That was the 90s.

364
00:23:42.96 --> 00:23:43.96
That was the 90s.

365
00:23:43.96 --> 00:23:44.96
That was the 90s.

366
00:23:44.96 --> 00:23:45.96
That was the 90s.

367
00:23:45.96 --> 00:23:45.96
The 90s.

368
00:23:45.96 --> 00:23:48.96
Top track of this is already the 90s.

369
00:23:48.96 --> 00:23:48.96
That's the 90s.

370
00:23:48.96 --> 00:23:53.96
This can be used by a scientist

371
00:23:53.96 --> 00:23:54.96
who has been job indirectly approve.

372
00:23:54.96 --> 00:23:56.96
You know,

373
00:23:56.96 --> 00:23:57.96
you're out walking your route,

374
00:23:57.96 --> 00:24:00.32
and your personal supervisor

375
00:24:00.32 --> 00:24:01.96
drives up.

376
00:24:01.96 --> 00:24:02.96
And he said,

377
00:24:02.96 --> 00:24:02.96
hey Chris,

378
00:24:02.96 --> 00:24:05.96
your marine unit just called the office,

379
00:24:05.96 --> 00:24:08.68
on his face.

380
00:24:08.68 --> 00:24:12.64
Then you say here, the Marine Corps had never called the post office looking for me before.

381
00:24:12.64 --> 00:24:15.80
And the latest and greatest from the air waves had not been good.

382
00:24:15.80 --> 00:24:16.80
This had to be serious business.

383
00:24:16.80 --> 00:24:22.08
The United States and Iraq had been playing a silly game of posturing for years now.

384
00:24:22.08 --> 00:24:26.04
With the terrorist attack on the Twin Towers in New York City, a little over a year ago,

385
00:24:26.04 --> 00:24:31.44
and the Afghan war raging on, all this just might have been coming to ahead in another

386
00:24:31.44 --> 00:24:34.04
region of the world.

387
00:24:34.04 --> 00:24:37.72
So you must have been hearing about other units getting called up.

388
00:24:37.72 --> 00:24:39.72
And had to know what was going down.

389
00:24:39.72 --> 00:24:46.68
We had the 26th Mewsock Marine Expeditionary Unit come over to Dayton, Ohio.

390
00:24:46.68 --> 00:24:49.28
And they were staying at right-patter-shener for space.

391
00:24:49.28 --> 00:24:53.000
And they were flying to 53s and 46s all around.

392
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.64
And they were practicing clarin' out buildings and stuff, and the newspaper said, we're

393
00:24:59.64 --> 00:25:02.84
preparing for Baghdad, we're preparing to go in Iraq.

394
00:25:02.84 --> 00:25:10.68
And I thought, well, if anything was to happen, I'll be getting called up to that.

395
00:25:10.68 --> 00:25:15.80
But that was kind of after they left, nobody started, you know, always talk about anything

396
00:25:15.80 --> 00:25:16.80
more.

397
00:25:16.80 --> 00:25:19.28
So, hey, go back to the River and Mail.

398
00:25:19.28 --> 00:25:25.20
Until I get my phone call, and I always dreamt about it and how it could happen and stuff.

399
00:25:25.20 --> 00:25:27.56
But how many times have they said, oh, prepare for this?

400
00:25:27.56 --> 00:25:29.20
Oh, no, stand down.

401
00:25:29.20 --> 00:25:33.20
We're going to go up to Vietnam and help clean it.

402
00:25:33.20 --> 00:25:34.20
No, we're not.

403
00:25:34.20 --> 00:25:35.52
We're going to go to Kosovo and help no, no, we're not.

404
00:25:35.52 --> 00:25:37.04
And then finally, we're doing this.

405
00:25:37.04 --> 00:25:39.04
We're not going to get called up.

406
00:25:39.04 --> 00:25:40.68
They're not going to be this.

407
00:25:40.68 --> 00:25:41.68
So the call comes.

408
00:25:41.68 --> 00:25:44.20
You find out that you're actually getting an activated.

409
00:25:44.20 --> 00:25:50.16
And you say here, I was excited, sad, overwhelmed, unsure, motivated, and proud all at the

410
00:25:50.16 --> 00:25:51.16
same time.

411
00:25:51.16 --> 00:25:54.28
That's a pretty good combination of emotions.

412
00:25:54.28 --> 00:25:59.40
I knew that this day was the first baby step in a wild Odyssey that would take my life

413
00:25:59.40 --> 00:26:00.88
for a whirl.

414
00:26:00.88 --> 00:26:04.96
And in the end, leave me a very different man than I was before that phone call.

415
00:26:04.96 --> 00:26:09.52
I wasn't stupid or blind to the prospect that in the very near future, a father might

416
00:26:09.52 --> 00:26:14.52
lose a son, a wife might lose a husband, a daughter might lose a father, and a daydream

417
00:26:14.52 --> 00:26:17.80
of better days may never be fulfilled.

418
00:26:17.80 --> 00:26:21.12
Because at this point, you're married and you have a daughter.

419
00:26:21.12 --> 00:26:22.92
And how long has you been married for at this point?

420
00:26:22.92 --> 00:26:25.92
Oh, man.

421
00:26:25.92 --> 00:26:26.92
Over two years.

422
00:26:26.92 --> 00:26:27.92
Okay.

423
00:26:27.92 --> 00:26:32.68
Young dad, young dad, you know, first real job.

424
00:26:32.68 --> 00:26:37.92
It just got house, you know, and just love in life, you know.

425
00:26:37.92 --> 00:26:42.08
I didn't think, you know, anything was ever going to happen.

426
00:26:42.08 --> 00:26:44.80
I was going to spend my 20 plus years at the post office.

427
00:26:44.80 --> 00:26:46.80
And that was it.

428
00:26:46.80 --> 00:26:48.40
And be happily married.

429
00:26:48.40 --> 00:26:55.40
Like pick it fences and dogs, you know, mom's apple pie kind of thing, you know.

430
00:26:55.40 --> 00:26:58.40
Uh, well, you signed that dotted line.

431
00:26:58.40 --> 00:26:59.40
I know.

432
00:26:59.40 --> 00:27:02.08
You signed that dotted line.

433
00:27:02.08 --> 00:27:05.04
You say here in the Grand Structure of the Marine Corps, our reserve unit was like no

434
00:27:05.04 --> 00:27:06.04
other.

435
00:27:06.04 --> 00:27:10.88
We were a hot pot, hot pot collection of different mission occupational specialties, MOSs.

436
00:27:10.88 --> 00:27:14.84
Most of us came straight out of infantry school, holding such titles as riflemen, machine

437
00:27:14.84 --> 00:27:16.84
gunners, and assault men.

438
00:27:16.84 --> 00:27:21.32
Others were administrative Marines, motor transport, map makers, and aircraft repairmen.

439
00:27:21.32 --> 00:27:27.08
There were a healthy mix of Marines who had prior service and those like me who did not.

440
00:27:27.08 --> 00:27:30.36
College students made up a good portion of the platoon working on medical, political science

441
00:27:30.36 --> 00:27:32.08
and criminal justice degrees.

442
00:27:32.08 --> 00:27:35.36
There were many of us blue collar guys in the mix having jobs anywhere from a train

443
00:27:35.36 --> 00:27:38.40
conductor and plumber to law enforcement officers.

444
00:27:38.40 --> 00:27:42.80
Within our ranks, we were 33 strong outside the remote chance of participating in the recovery

445
00:27:42.80 --> 00:27:47.64
of lost remains in Vietnam or some sunny tropical island in the South Pacific.

446
00:27:47.64 --> 00:27:52.80
None of us ever wanted to be activated to do the mission in a wartime capability.

447
00:27:52.80 --> 00:27:57.12
We were proud to be the only mortuary affairs platoon in the entire Marine Corps.

448
00:27:57.12 --> 00:28:01.36
Even though in reality, we really didn't know what that duty would demand of us or what

449
00:28:01.36 --> 00:28:04.56
kind of toll it would take.

450
00:28:04.56 --> 00:28:07.92
You guys were the only mortuary affairs platoon in the entire Marine Corps.

451
00:28:07.92 --> 00:28:11.12
So it was a guarantee you guys were getting called up.

452
00:28:11.12 --> 00:28:15.92
And then back in the 90s, they were talking about getting rid of us.

453
00:28:15.92 --> 00:28:23.92
All up until our Lieutenant Colonel decided to change the name and try to make it sexier.

454
00:28:23.92 --> 00:28:25.64
And he was able to save that.

455
00:28:25.64 --> 00:28:32.04
It convinced enough people over at headquarters Marine Corps that we should save this little group.

456
00:28:32.04 --> 00:28:33.04
You know what he knew?

457
00:28:33.04 --> 00:28:35.44
That apparently other people didn't know is that the nature of war is death.

458
00:28:35.44 --> 00:28:37.16
And you're going to have to deal with this.

459
00:28:37.16 --> 00:28:40.48
Because if you think about what would be going on if you didn't have this platoon and what

460
00:28:40.48 --> 00:28:43.20
knowledge would be lost and who's going to handle these?

461
00:28:43.20 --> 00:28:44.20
Yeah.

462
00:28:44.20 --> 00:28:46.000
That's what happens in peacetime.

463
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.16
Yeah.

464
00:28:47.16 --> 00:28:51.76
People forget that you know even preparing for something like this, we would always come

465
00:28:51.76 --> 00:28:57.64
out here to camp pelton and we would get ready to get trained and they were like,

466
00:28:57.64 --> 00:28:59.24
oh, what do you guys do?

467
00:28:59.24 --> 00:29:00.24
Mortuary affairs.

468
00:29:00.24 --> 00:29:02.92
So what do you guys do?

469
00:29:02.92 --> 00:29:05.04
We handle the cease.

470
00:29:05.04 --> 00:29:08.12
No, you guys are going to be working at the kitchen.

471
00:29:08.12 --> 00:29:09.12
You guys are going to be a KP.

472
00:29:09.12 --> 00:29:11.96
You guys are going to do a Mestuity for two weeks.

473
00:29:11.96 --> 00:29:12.96
No, we're not.

474
00:29:12.96 --> 00:29:14.76
So we'll go out and get lost.

475
00:29:14.76 --> 00:29:18.92
We don't take our stuff out to you know, out to the beach, get lost.

476
00:29:18.92 --> 00:29:23.80
Hook up with with a recon unit that was doing night inserts on Zodiacs.

477
00:29:23.80 --> 00:29:26.40
And that's what we did for two weeks, man.

478
00:29:26.40 --> 00:29:30.92
But yeah, everybody back then was, oh, nobody's going to die.

479
00:29:30.92 --> 00:29:32.56
No, we won't even need you.

480
00:29:32.56 --> 00:29:34.56
We can look at the Gulf War.

481
00:29:34.56 --> 00:29:35.56
No, no.

482
00:29:35.56 --> 00:29:40.12
No, no, this how they actually started when we actually got deployed to that was the

483
00:29:40.12 --> 00:29:42.68
attitude.

484
00:29:42.68 --> 00:29:47.08
So you know, you go through some stuff about what you guys did when you guys got called

485
00:29:47.08 --> 00:29:52.84
up and I have to say, I always have to say this, I'm not reading the whole book.

486
00:29:52.84 --> 00:29:56.20
And so this might jump around a little bit or you might think, oh, what was that?

487
00:29:56.20 --> 00:29:57.92
Well, it's because I'm not reading the whole book.

488
00:29:57.92 --> 00:29:59.36
You got to buy the book yourself.

489
00:29:59.36 --> 00:30:01.96
That's what you need to do to get these to get this entire story.

490
00:30:01.96 --> 00:30:07.36
And this is a big book and there's all kinds of details that don't go into.

491
00:30:07.36 --> 00:30:09.96
So I'm just covering some of it.

492
00:30:09.96 --> 00:30:13.40
So if it jumps a little bit, that's why.

493
00:30:13.40 --> 00:30:16.40
And I'm going to make a jump right now to this.

494
00:30:16.40 --> 00:30:21.16
As we circled about in a holding pattern, high above the sand's a quake, curious marines

495
00:30:21.16 --> 00:30:23.32
gazed out upon our new reality.

496
00:30:23.32 --> 00:30:25.40
This was to be our new home away from home.

497
00:30:25.40 --> 00:30:28.48
And the lives that we knew were now over.

498
00:30:28.48 --> 00:30:32.64
That toilet and hard work were the only promises that the Marine Corps afforded us.

499
00:30:32.64 --> 00:30:34.92
And we reveled at the very thought of it.

500
00:30:34.92 --> 00:30:37.88
We are the marines of M.A.

501
00:30:37.88 --> 00:30:39.44
We were from Dayton, Ohio.

502
00:30:39.44 --> 00:30:42.64
And we were eager for the chance to prove ourselves on active duty.

503
00:30:42.64 --> 00:30:47.40
We were eager to prove ourselves in war.

504
00:30:47.40 --> 00:30:50.72
That's the attitude.

505
00:30:50.72 --> 00:30:55.32
And there's, you go through some great stuff in here, just talking about.

506
00:30:55.32 --> 00:30:59.28
And talking about what your guy's attitude was like.

507
00:30:59.28 --> 00:31:03.16
And it's exactly what you think everyone's attitude would be like in the Marine Corps,

508
00:31:03.16 --> 00:31:05.44
in the Army, in special operations.

509
00:31:05.44 --> 00:31:09.24
We've been training this stuff for our whole lives and we're ready to go.

510
00:31:09.24 --> 00:31:14.44
And actually I was going to say that there was probably no one in your cartoon that had ever

511
00:31:14.44 --> 00:31:15.92
been any kind of combat.

512
00:31:15.92 --> 00:31:18.76
But you actually had a few guys that had been in the first call floor.

513
00:31:18.76 --> 00:31:19.96
Thank you, I had to.

514
00:31:19.96 --> 00:31:20.96
Yeah.

515
00:31:20.96 --> 00:31:24.72
Because my first deployment to Iraq, there was zero experience.

516
00:31:24.72 --> 00:31:30.64
And zero combat experience, which was pretty normal for the SEAL teams, because we hadn't

517
00:31:30.64 --> 00:31:33.96
been in a war in whatever 20 years.

518
00:31:33.96 --> 00:31:37.08
And so there was a couple of guys that had to action in Somalia, a couple of guys that had

519
00:31:37.08 --> 00:31:39.84
action in Panama, that weren't in my platoon.

520
00:31:39.84 --> 00:31:42.56
But most guys were just fresh.

521
00:31:42.56 --> 00:31:43.96
And then you think about it.

522
00:31:43.96 --> 00:31:48.48
Even guys that were in the first goal for the chances that they were in some of those

523
00:31:48.48 --> 00:31:51.64
scenarios that had like legitimate combat.

524
00:31:51.64 --> 00:31:54.52
A, the chances of that were very small.

525
00:31:54.52 --> 00:31:59.64
And b, even if they were in that, it was like isolated incidents.

526
00:31:59.64 --> 00:32:03.16
You know, even guys in the SEAL team that were in the goal for that got in firefights,

527
00:32:03.16 --> 00:32:06.24
it was isolated like they got into a firefight.

528
00:32:06.24 --> 00:32:07.24
Right.

529
00:32:07.24 --> 00:32:12.40
It wasn't sustained combat operations that, that obviously we were about to move into

530
00:32:12.40 --> 00:32:13.40
as a nation.

531
00:32:13.40 --> 00:32:18.88
We had a very good healthy mix of guys who served back then during the goal for

532
00:32:18.88 --> 00:32:23.12
their BFCs and Lance Corpals and they were all infantry guys.

533
00:32:23.12 --> 00:32:28.28
So we got guys from being mortarmen, machine gunners, and you know, we got guys who were

534
00:32:28.28 --> 00:32:29.28
supplied guys.

535
00:32:29.28 --> 00:32:34.60
So we kind of got the idea of more of a bigger picture of what to expect as far as how the

536
00:32:34.60 --> 00:32:37.20
living conditions were there.

537
00:32:37.20 --> 00:32:39.80
What was the mindset of being?

538
00:32:39.80 --> 00:32:43.60
Because most of us were just, hey, we're finally on act of duty.

539
00:32:43.60 --> 00:32:45.56
This is so freaking cool.

540
00:32:45.56 --> 00:32:48.68
And hey, let's go ahead and fill Sandbags.

541
00:32:48.68 --> 00:32:50.000
I love filling Sandbags.

542
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.52
You know, because at home we don't fill Sandbags, but, you know, we were very lucky, very,

543
00:32:54.52 --> 00:32:56.48
very lucky to have the people that we did.

544
00:32:56.48 --> 00:33:02.48
And thank God we had them just because, yes, they had that leadership experience, but

545
00:33:02.48 --> 00:33:12.96
also they prepared us very well to handle the pressures that we're about to come.

546
00:33:12.96 --> 00:33:21.28
But I had a little bit only 22 miles from the Iraqi border camp, coyote was a gigantic

547
00:33:21.28 --> 00:33:26.68
US military installation of open desert terrain populated by small encampments named after

548
00:33:26.68 --> 00:33:33.16
different Marine Corps battles, which dotted the vast open, coyote landscape from California

549
00:33:33.16 --> 00:33:42.48
to Ireland to Cyprus to Kuwait International Airport to highway 80 to camp coyote.

550
00:33:42.48 --> 00:33:47.36
And now finally, our long trip of 30 plus hours ended on Camp Tartwa.

551
00:33:47.36 --> 00:33:50.40
We were exhausted, but still excited enough to check out our new digs.

552
00:33:50.40 --> 00:33:54.88
We quickly unloaded our gear off the truck and we were directed to our assigned white

553
00:33:54.88 --> 00:33:56.80
tent just like the ones at the airport.

554
00:33:56.80 --> 00:34:00.12
It was hard to believe that we were actually in Kuwait standing on the line against

555
00:34:00.12 --> 00:34:02.68
the despotic dictator.

556
00:34:02.68 --> 00:34:07.68
Somewhere across these desert stands, he was waiting for us and by all accounts with weapons

557
00:34:07.68 --> 00:34:09.40
of mass destruction.

558
00:34:09.40 --> 00:34:13.76
It was only going to be a matter of time before something big happened that would change

559
00:34:13.76 --> 00:34:15.68
the whole world.

560
00:34:15.68 --> 00:34:18.36
Only time would tell what would happen next.

561
00:34:18.36 --> 00:34:25.12
Now, of course, people like to talk now about the weapons of mass destruction, which

562
00:34:25.12 --> 00:34:29.40
you know, there was isolated things that were found, but you know, there wasn't, he

563
00:34:29.40 --> 00:34:33.32
never attacked US forces or coalition forces with weapons of mass destruction.

564
00:34:33.32 --> 00:34:35.76
But you guys had to think that was common.

565
00:34:35.76 --> 00:34:41.68
Oh, we knew it was common.

566
00:34:41.68 --> 00:34:45.92
And we already resigned ourselves off if it was common that most of us wouldn't make it.

567
00:34:45.92 --> 00:34:48.92
When the shooting started, they pushed us up there.

568
00:34:48.92 --> 00:34:53.76
Of our trucks out of the three units, that many teams that we had, each of us had 1200

569
00:34:53.76 --> 00:34:57.20
remains pouches or body backs.

570
00:34:57.20 --> 00:35:02.72
They're expecting us to fight and keep on fighting until we died and the other two units

571
00:35:02.72 --> 00:35:09.04
that we trained before we left the US, those guys, which was a come-up and clean us up

572
00:35:09.04 --> 00:35:14.68
with another 1200 remains body bags after them.

573
00:35:14.68 --> 00:35:19.20
So they were expecting a health fire.

574
00:35:19.20 --> 00:35:25.36
And we're the first time that we were honestly looking at combat resembling World War

575
00:35:25.36 --> 00:35:26.88
one stuff.

576
00:35:26.88 --> 00:35:31.04
But with worst stuff on the menu, you know, Vx nerve gas.

577
00:35:31.04 --> 00:35:36.48
Yeah, I mean, all the prospects was just, it was dire.

578
00:35:36.48 --> 00:35:39.76
It was bad.

579
00:35:39.76 --> 00:35:45.84
You say here, we moved from Camp Taro to Camp Iwo Jima within our first week and soon

580
00:35:45.84 --> 00:35:49.96
after we arrived, we were notified that every unit on Iwo Jima had to build at least one

581
00:35:49.96 --> 00:35:54.40
bunker as a defense against Saddam Hussein's ballistic missile inventory.

582
00:35:54.40 --> 00:36:00.76
When our first week of being on Iwo Jima were assigned to our area to build one scud bunker,

583
00:36:00.76 --> 00:36:04.92
our days consisted of filling, throwing, and neatly stacking 35 to 40 pound sandbags for

584
00:36:04.92 --> 00:36:07.64
first light until late evening all by hand.

585
00:36:07.64 --> 00:36:08.64
We were a service.

586
00:36:08.64 --> 00:36:12.68
It was a brand new thing for us to do and we turned everything into a game and had fun with

587
00:36:12.68 --> 00:36:13.68
it.

588
00:36:13.68 --> 00:36:17.08
We would laugh, joke, and sing songs as we accomplished our task and the senior leadership

589
00:36:17.08 --> 00:36:21.88
of the active duty platoons watching us would stand in awe of how we worked together as

590
00:36:21.88 --> 00:36:25.48
we performed our medial tasks such as sandbag duty.

591
00:36:25.48 --> 00:36:29.56
On occasion, I heard a few of them ask our leaders what their secret was to get all of

592
00:36:29.56 --> 00:36:31.56
us troops to be so motivated.

593
00:36:31.56 --> 00:36:36.28
Gunnery Sergeant Ballantine, I say that right, Ballantine, Ballantine would only shrug and

594
00:36:36.28 --> 00:36:37.28
smile.

595
00:36:37.28 --> 00:36:40.52
I had to put that in there and there's so many things again, I got to select what I'm

596
00:36:40.52 --> 00:36:45.20
going to read out of here, but just that attitude of we're going to have a good time.

597
00:36:45.20 --> 00:36:46.20
Absolutely.

598
00:36:46.20 --> 00:36:47.20
It is the best attitude.

599
00:36:47.20 --> 00:36:55.04
Turn everything into a game and roll with it.

600
00:36:55.04 --> 00:37:07.36
You get your first taste of what's to come when a black-hawk crash occurred and you say

601
00:37:07.36 --> 00:37:14.000
here it was quite a trick while riding across the desert in our home-vees, but we finally

602
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.36
arrived and set eyes upon the crash scene.

603
00:37:17.36 --> 00:37:19.36
It was nothing short of shocking.

604
00:37:19.36 --> 00:37:22.88
The yellow was spread across the distance of a football field and literally thousands of

605
00:37:22.88 --> 00:37:25.28
twisted, burnt and melted pieces.

606
00:37:25.28 --> 00:37:29.12
From our vantage point, the scene looked so much more complex than anything our World

607
00:37:29.12 --> 00:37:32.92
War II era manuals had explained, recovery scenes to be.

608
00:37:32.92 --> 00:37:36.72
There was no way that all that classroom work and infield training could have ever

609
00:37:36.72 --> 00:37:40.40
replicated the amount of destruction that lay upon the field.

610
00:37:40.40 --> 00:37:45.60
Now, this is interesting, but since this was considered a peace-time accident, the National

611
00:37:45.60 --> 00:37:51.36
Transportation Safety Board had the lead on the investigation not the military and they dictated

612
00:37:51.36 --> 00:37:56.48
who was allowed on the scene and who wasn't.

613
00:37:56.48 --> 00:38:02.48
You guys show up and they let you guys help them.

614
00:38:02.48 --> 00:38:03.48
Right.

615
00:38:03.48 --> 00:38:05.48
They're a manpower.

616
00:38:05.48 --> 00:38:09.60
You say we found several portions of human remains scattered throughout as well as a few

617
00:38:09.60 --> 00:38:11.80
personal items such as fragments of a watch.

618
00:38:11.80 --> 00:38:16.96
We kept finding a hard glass-like substance resembling thick, burnt sugar or melted glass

619
00:38:16.96 --> 00:38:18.36
in the sand.

620
00:38:18.36 --> 00:38:23.32
This substance was found in large pools and spread throughout the crash site.

621
00:38:23.32 --> 00:38:30.12
We had to chip away at it so we continued to search for pieces of human remains fragments

622
00:38:30.12 --> 00:38:32.68
and pertinent identification media.

623
00:38:32.68 --> 00:38:38.04
Once asked, the NTSB agent informed us that the glass-like substance was actually pools

624
00:38:38.04 --> 00:38:43.000
of blood that had been exposed to high heat and then crystallized.

625
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.52
It was something that we never had been taught.

626
00:38:45.52 --> 00:38:50.04
And all the literature did not mention how bodily fluids such as blood could caramelize

627
00:38:50.04 --> 00:38:52.84
and resemble burnt sugar or melted glass.

628
00:38:52.84 --> 00:38:56.44
It also did not mention that when sections of the Heal of Burned or Melted, they

629
00:38:56.44 --> 00:38:59.52
can resemble bone or burned flesh.

630
00:38:59.52 --> 00:39:03.72
The most valuable lesson that I learned that day was how to use in everyday items such

631
00:39:03.72 --> 00:39:08.60
as a screwdriver to tell of questionable items who are indeed human remains versus burned

632
00:39:08.60 --> 00:39:13.08
metal, insulating foam or melted plastics and silicon.

633
00:39:13.08 --> 00:39:17.32
Just tap the item with a screwdriver and one can feel the difference.

634
00:39:17.32 --> 00:39:21.24
This was definitely something that was not taught or even mentioned.

635
00:39:21.24 --> 00:39:27.28
One day in the future this new technique would prove to be very handy.

636
00:39:27.28 --> 00:39:29.64
What is that?

637
00:39:29.64 --> 00:39:30.64
What's the difference?

638
00:39:30.64 --> 00:39:33.24
You come across some fragment.

639
00:39:33.24 --> 00:39:38.36
You want to know if it's human remains or if it's part of the cartman aircrafts.

640
00:39:38.36 --> 00:39:39.76
Vehicles, helicopters.

641
00:39:39.76 --> 00:39:44.92
There are so many components that are made with all these different composite materials

642
00:39:44.92 --> 00:39:50.96
and plastics and rubbers and metals that they all look the same.

643
00:39:50.96 --> 00:39:55.20
They all look like human remains that are burned up and mangled.

644
00:39:55.20 --> 00:39:59.08
It is very, very hard to tell the difference.

645
00:39:59.08 --> 00:40:02.60
I never knew that until we worked with these gentlemen.

646
00:40:02.60 --> 00:40:06.12
They pulled out a screwdriver and they showed us how to do it.

647
00:40:06.12 --> 00:40:11.68
There's like I said in there, you can feel how if you tap it and how it, because

648
00:40:11.68 --> 00:40:13.68
it's like a can.

649
00:40:13.68 --> 00:40:16.20
You can feel that that's a solid piece.

650
00:40:16.20 --> 00:40:18.76
If you tap it, it's something that's burnt flesh.

651
00:40:18.76 --> 00:40:26.64
It has its own kind of makeup and you can tell.

652
00:40:26.64 --> 00:40:31.56
When these catastrophic scenes are like this, you can literally look at millions and millions

653
00:40:31.56 --> 00:40:35.08
of pieces and to narrow things down.

654
00:40:35.08 --> 00:40:37.92
That was just a tripped day show.

655
00:40:37.92 --> 00:40:41.20
I've never seen anything like that before.

656
00:40:41.20 --> 00:40:47.52
We were very, very fortunate to work with those guys.

657
00:40:47.52 --> 00:40:52.36
You guys are in Kuwait and obviously this whole time there's the tension we're waiting,

658
00:40:52.36 --> 00:40:57.60
you're waiting, not knowing what's going to happen.

659
00:40:57.60 --> 00:41:03.16
One night you're asleep and going back to the book, I heard the shuffle of boots scraping

660
00:41:03.16 --> 00:41:06.78
the loose sand against the plywood floor and it caught my attention, but I kept my eyes

661
00:41:06.78 --> 00:41:08.68
closed just in case it wasn't for me.

662
00:41:08.68 --> 00:41:15.28
I heard a flick of a flashlight being turned on, a normal nightleak occurrence in the

663
00:41:15.28 --> 00:41:17.96
of the fire watch waking up is relief for duty.

664
00:41:17.96 --> 00:41:23.80
I heard a cop squeak as the fire watch was trying to wake someone, Sergeant Bustler.

665
00:41:23.80 --> 00:41:27.08
The whisper seemed too loud against the quieter the dark tent.

666
00:41:27.08 --> 00:41:32.04
I opened my eyes and found the beam of flashlight shining in my face and another MA

667
00:41:32.04 --> 00:41:37.28
Marine three cops down over here, Webster, what's up, man?

668
00:41:37.28 --> 00:41:39.44
We are going to war, bus.

669
00:41:39.44 --> 00:41:44.12
President Bush just told Saddam that him and his sons have 48 hours to get out of his

670
00:41:44.12 --> 00:41:48.44
country or we will forcefully remove him.

671
00:41:48.44 --> 00:41:53.16
He excitedly whispered those words, but it seemed as if he had yelled it out for everyone

672
00:41:53.16 --> 00:41:59.24
to hear because he said all the key words that made everyone's ears perk up out of a

673
00:41:59.24 --> 00:42:04.32
deep sleep.

674
00:42:04.32 --> 00:42:05.32
So there you go.

675
00:42:05.32 --> 00:42:10.48
And a little while later the announcement comes in, the loud announcement come in.

676
00:42:10.48 --> 00:42:13.80
Hey, somebody turn on the fucking lights, wake up, wake the fuck up.

677
00:42:13.80 --> 00:42:15.48
I don't care what you and you belong to.

678
00:42:15.48 --> 00:42:16.48
This shit applies to you.

679
00:42:16.48 --> 00:42:20.000
The president United States has just spoken and he's given Saddam who's saying in the

680
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
sons, 48 hour deadline to pack their shit and get out of the fucking country.

681
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.60
If they do not comply, the president has given us the green light to evict their asses.

682
00:42:31.60 --> 00:42:33.16
So that's it.

683
00:42:33.16 --> 00:42:38.44
Now you guys know, continue on, are you divided up into three official teams?

684
00:42:38.44 --> 00:42:43.68
We received the final gear check, the ammo, the extra ammo had been disseminated.

685
00:42:43.68 --> 00:42:46.52
But there was a giant deficiency that was blatant in everyone's thought.

686
00:42:46.52 --> 00:42:49.24
We had no vehicles to transport us north, north.

687
00:42:49.24 --> 00:42:53.36
We had no night vision goggles to see in the dark and we had no crew serve weapons to set

688
00:42:53.36 --> 00:42:55.12
up proper defensive positions.

689
00:42:55.12 --> 00:43:00.32
The entire Marine Corps was going to war and no one had fought to give us body baggers

690
00:43:00.32 --> 00:43:04.000
the needed assets to support them.

691
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
So no night vision?

692
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Nothing.

693
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
No vehicles.

694
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Nothing.

695
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.88
We were literally begging people.

696
00:43:13.88 --> 00:43:17.04
As people were gearing up, they're loading up their vehicles.

697
00:43:17.04 --> 00:43:22.56
Everybody is loading up ammo, water, chow and everything.

698
00:43:22.56 --> 00:43:27.52
High five in each other, you know, hugging and here we are staring at everybody sitting

699
00:43:27.52 --> 00:43:28.52
on the bench.

700
00:43:28.52 --> 00:43:30.32
You know, wait for everybody.

701
00:43:30.32 --> 00:43:31.76
Hey, can we please go?

702
00:43:31.76 --> 00:43:35.16
Hey guys, we'd like to play too.

703
00:43:35.16 --> 00:43:39.96
Luckily there was some maneuvering going on, going back to the major in the gun.

704
00:43:39.96 --> 00:43:44.96
The major in gunning bound time, for Nagled to deal with the camp common down back at

705
00:43:44.96 --> 00:43:48.96
the O'Gima, so Colonel Higgins is giving us three five tons with trailers.

706
00:43:48.96 --> 00:43:52.88
It took a while but our three vehicles rolled up and each of our team strapped our packs

707
00:43:52.88 --> 00:43:58.04
onto the outside and hurriedly prepared our areas in the bed of the trucks.

708
00:43:58.04 --> 00:44:02.14
And again, jumping forward, the convoy headed north on the highway, passed the Toyota

709
00:44:02.14 --> 00:44:06.12
trucks with large machine guns, mounted in the back of the coiety police.

710
00:44:06.12 --> 00:44:11.40
We made our way into the desert, past coiety, T72 tanks, patrolling their side of the Iraqi

711
00:44:11.40 --> 00:44:12.40
border.

712
00:44:12.40 --> 00:44:14.56
And several miles we arrived at our destination.

713
00:44:14.56 --> 00:44:17.24
The sun was beginning its trek toward the far horizon.

714
00:44:17.24 --> 00:44:21.80
And as far as my eyes could see, there were military trucks and humbys all spread out

715
00:44:21.80 --> 00:44:25.24
with hundreds of with hundreds of yards in between them.

716
00:44:25.24 --> 00:44:30.52
Balantine's team, three truck, sat about 200 yards away and I could see them digging

717
00:44:30.52 --> 00:44:31.52
in.

718
00:44:31.52 --> 00:44:33.96
All right, guys, Sergeant Davis spoke up.

719
00:44:33.96 --> 00:44:38.76
We are now well within, well inside Iraqi artillery range.

720
00:44:38.76 --> 00:44:45.36
We need to immediately dig skirmish holes to sleep in and change over into our mop suits.

721
00:44:45.36 --> 00:44:48.40
Make sure that you keep your gas mask on you at all times because we don't know when the

722
00:44:48.40 --> 00:44:52.20
Iraqi army will start hitting us with gas or eat your holes.

723
00:44:52.20 --> 00:44:53.20
North is that way.

724
00:44:53.20 --> 00:44:56.96
And remember what everybody is, do not get out of your holes unless you absolutely have to.

725
00:44:56.96 --> 00:45:00.76
And there is 100% light discipline because light travels out here and we don't want to give

726
00:45:00.76 --> 00:45:02.44
the Iraqi something to shoot out.

727
00:45:02.44 --> 00:45:03.44
Good to go.

728
00:45:03.44 --> 00:45:04.44
Good.

729
00:45:04.44 --> 00:45:06.24
Let's get it done.

730
00:45:06.24 --> 00:45:11.16
So you're putting your mop suits on, which is your chemical biological radiological protection

731
00:45:11.16 --> 00:45:13.36
allegedly suits.

732
00:45:13.36 --> 00:45:20.80
I always thought to myself, how is this thing going to stop anything from going from, I mean,

733
00:45:20.80 --> 00:45:25.52
you don't, it's just like a jacket with some charcoal in it.

734
00:45:25.52 --> 00:45:26.52
Yeah.

735
00:45:26.52 --> 00:45:27.52
Some activated charcoal.

736
00:45:27.52 --> 00:45:29.24
Some pants with activated charcoal.

737
00:45:29.24 --> 00:45:30.44
You're wearing your regular boots.

738
00:45:30.44 --> 00:45:32.88
I guess we had boot covers too.

739
00:45:32.88 --> 00:45:39.24
I did one off where we did it. We were hitting a suspected weapons of masterstruction site.

740
00:45:39.24 --> 00:45:41.32
And so we went in mop level four.

741
00:45:41.32 --> 00:45:42.32
Gas masks on.

742
00:45:42.32 --> 00:45:43.32
Wow.

743
00:45:43.32 --> 00:45:45.88
Boots to hold nine yards gloves.

744
00:45:45.88 --> 00:45:48.16
We were not as effective as we should.

745
00:45:48.16 --> 00:45:53.84
And I was putting that thing on, you know, how is, it's just, it's just, you're putting

746
00:45:53.84 --> 00:45:56.84
on a pair of pants and it's sure not like some airtight thing.

747
00:45:56.84 --> 00:45:57.84
No, not at all.

748
00:45:57.84 --> 00:46:00.64
It doesn't make any sense when you're putting it on.

749
00:46:00.64 --> 00:46:05.28
So I don't have a lot of confidence on those things.

750
00:46:05.28 --> 00:46:10.44
But like I said, it's interesting that, you know, the quote that you give from Sergeant

751
00:46:10.44 --> 00:46:16.28
Davis is, is we don't know when the Iraqi army will start to hit us with gas.

752
00:46:16.28 --> 00:46:17.48
It wasn't like if they will.

753
00:46:17.48 --> 00:46:18.48
It's like when?

754
00:46:18.48 --> 00:46:19.48
Yep.

755
00:46:19.48 --> 00:46:25.88
We fully expected it.

756
00:46:25.88 --> 00:46:29.28
Jumped forward under the pitch black sky of a Quadie night.

757
00:46:29.28 --> 00:46:31.84
I finally surrendered my conscious to slumber.

758
00:46:31.84 --> 00:46:33.52
I no longer feared the unknown.

759
00:46:33.52 --> 00:46:35.88
I was willing to accept my fate as it came.

760
00:46:35.88 --> 00:46:44.16
It was time to prove ourselves and rid the world of a monster.

761
00:46:44.16 --> 00:46:45.84
Next chapter is called Into the Breach.

762
00:46:45.84 --> 00:46:47.84
Holy shit.

763
00:46:47.84 --> 00:46:51.60
Look at all the impacts up there.

764
00:46:51.60 --> 00:46:52.60
Curve, curve, caler.

765
00:46:52.60 --> 00:46:54.16
My saying that right.

766
00:46:54.16 --> 00:46:58.32
Corporal caler said, I almost fell asleep until I heard the jets flying over.

767
00:46:58.32 --> 00:47:00.48
God damn brother, we are at war now.

768
00:47:00.48 --> 00:47:01.64
This shit is for real.

769
00:47:01.64 --> 00:47:04.76
We are at fucking war.

770
00:47:04.76 --> 00:47:06.96
The morning crept in.

771
00:47:06.96 --> 00:47:09.36
And then it comes gas gas gas.

772
00:47:09.36 --> 00:47:10.72
Oh my god.

773
00:47:10.72 --> 00:47:11.72
Fuck.

774
00:47:11.72 --> 00:47:14.24
The other trucks, a hundred yards from a screamed out.

775
00:47:14.24 --> 00:47:17.80
I closed my eyes, held my breath instantly reached down from my gas mask.

776
00:47:17.80 --> 00:47:20.16
My adrenaline shot through the freaking roof.

777
00:47:20.16 --> 00:47:22.96
Did the bastards actually drop gas on us?

778
00:47:22.96 --> 00:47:26.96
What we thought was a fast time to put a gas mask on back in Ewo Jima.

779
00:47:26.96 --> 00:47:28.44
Now had just been beat.

780
00:47:28.44 --> 00:47:32.76
We rushed putting on our mobgeat suits, cinching down the Velcro straps around the rubber

781
00:47:32.76 --> 00:47:34.76
boots and around the wrists.

782
00:47:34.76 --> 00:47:38.24
The black rubber gloves came on last and suddenly I could feel the warmth of the sun

783
00:47:38.24 --> 00:47:43.08
soaking through the rubber suits infused with charcoal lining.

784
00:47:43.08 --> 00:47:45.000
And that gives it away right there.

785
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.48
The Velcro straps around the rubber.

786
00:47:47.48 --> 00:47:50.32
Like that's supposed to help you.

787
00:47:50.32 --> 00:47:52.64
You know, it just doesn't.

788
00:47:52.64 --> 00:47:54.60
Doesn't seem to make sense.

789
00:47:54.60 --> 00:47:55.60
Going forward.

790
00:47:55.60 --> 00:47:59.56
We'll learn one among many that day as soon as all clear was sounded and we could hear

791
00:47:59.56 --> 00:48:02.32
the rest of the Marines down from us carry out the order.

792
00:48:02.32 --> 00:48:04.80
Gas gas gas would be sounded again.

793
00:48:04.80 --> 00:48:08.84
It repeated itself and became an all day game as soon as we opened an MRE for

794
00:48:08.84 --> 00:48:09.84
child.

795
00:48:09.84 --> 00:48:13.48
The alarm would be sounded and we had to suit up when the all clear came.

796
00:48:13.48 --> 00:48:14.92
It was sounded once more.

797
00:48:14.92 --> 00:48:21.88
I started to think that maybe I shouldn't have been eating my open MRE.

798
00:48:21.88 --> 00:48:28.92
Literally, since one side would be saying all clear the other side would be saying gas

799
00:48:28.92 --> 00:48:33.32
gas gas and it was just chasing each other all day long.

800
00:48:33.32 --> 00:48:35.96
It would be got stupid.

801
00:48:35.96 --> 00:48:44.40
But we've found out later on was they were monitoring the Iraqi skin missiles and whenever

802
00:48:44.40 --> 00:48:48.88
they flipped the radar on so they can get prepared to launch they would call a gas

803
00:48:48.88 --> 00:48:49.88
attack.

804
00:48:49.88 --> 00:48:50.88
Got it.

805
00:48:50.88 --> 00:48:55.88
It was literally somebody up there was flipping off and flipping on flipping on.

806
00:48:55.88 --> 00:49:00.88
And as far as I know, for my position they didn't send any.

807
00:49:00.88 --> 00:49:05.12
But it was very, very annoying all day long.

808
00:49:05.12 --> 00:49:07.92
And the reason they have to flip those things on and off is they flip them on so they

809
00:49:07.92 --> 00:49:11.48
can kind of see where they're shooting them and prep them.

810
00:49:11.48 --> 00:49:12.48
And so I'm sure.

811
00:49:12.48 --> 00:49:17.56
And then as soon as you do that, Americans are going to bomb you big time.

812
00:49:17.56 --> 00:49:19.76
So that's, I'm guessing what that's what it was.

813
00:49:19.76 --> 00:49:21.24
Although I guess, it's just surface there.

814
00:49:21.24 --> 00:49:23.68
You could have it pre-dialed and maybe you don't need to give a signal.

815
00:49:23.68 --> 00:49:25.56
Who knows?

816
00:49:25.56 --> 00:49:28.76
But that's the kind of thing that happens in the military.

817
00:49:28.76 --> 00:49:29.76
You don't know.

818
00:49:29.76 --> 00:49:34.64
There's just things that are going on that you don't fully know.

819
00:49:34.64 --> 00:49:38.04
Continuing on, everything that we had trained for and been in preparation for was this

820
00:49:38.04 --> 00:49:39.04
exact moment.

821
00:49:39.04 --> 00:49:42.12
We had to hone our skills sharpened our mind, strengthen our bodies and prepared our

822
00:49:42.12 --> 00:49:43.44
spirits for this fight.

823
00:49:43.44 --> 00:49:45.24
We had committed our lives to the winds of fate.

824
00:49:45.24 --> 00:49:48.88
Our futures were now uncertain about our determination and rules of which see us through

825
00:49:48.88 --> 00:49:52.32
whatever hardships and challenges lay upon that horizon ahead.

826
00:49:52.32 --> 00:49:56.44
Contact with the enemy had already been initiated and we were moving northward toward

827
00:49:56.44 --> 00:49:57.84
the sound of guns.

828
00:49:57.84 --> 00:50:05.20
We were heading straight into the breach and the end of Sodom's rule begins tonight.

829
00:50:05.20 --> 00:50:09.64
It was bumper to bumper traffic, keeping along Highway 80, making our way to the fluorescent

830
00:50:09.64 --> 00:50:11.52
lights of the UN border checkpoint.

831
00:50:11.52 --> 00:50:15.24
We slowly made our way into the pitch black of an abandoned village.

832
00:50:15.24 --> 00:50:19.12
The only sound that could be heard were the idling of our engines and the nervous complaints

833
00:50:19.12 --> 00:50:22.80
of a lone dog barking in the night.

834
00:50:22.80 --> 00:50:27.06
It was the very first time I'd ever witnessed a regimental artillery fire mission in

835
00:50:27.06 --> 00:50:28.06
action.

836
00:50:28.06 --> 00:50:32.16
It was truly a beautiful sight to behold.

837
00:50:32.16 --> 00:50:36.96
These are the perspective that you have when you're going into this stuff for the first

838
00:50:36.96 --> 00:50:37.96
time.

839
00:50:37.96 --> 00:50:40.80
It was just incredible.

840
00:50:40.80 --> 00:50:48.000
And I really could look at these rounds being shot out and it looked like shooting stars

841
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.52
going up into the sky and they didn't see them crashing down to earth on top of Safwan

842
00:50:52.52 --> 00:50:54.88
Hill.

843
00:50:54.88 --> 00:51:01.48
And I could look at that scene playing out right before us and mirroring it to, you know,

844
00:51:01.48 --> 00:51:07.44
I would gema or an okinawa, your D-day is like wow that's just incredible.

845
00:51:07.44 --> 00:51:14.44
And I just felt so connected to this brotherhood of a long line of people fighting for

846
00:51:14.44 --> 00:51:18.88
freedom and you know, it was just all inspiring.

847
00:51:18.88 --> 00:51:23.16
Yeah, that's, when you, like you said, you grew up watching this stuff.

848
00:51:23.16 --> 00:51:25.20
You know, I grew up watching this stuff.

849
00:51:25.20 --> 00:51:28.88
And so when you see it for real happening and you know you're a part of it, oh yeah.

850
00:51:28.88 --> 00:51:34.60
Man, yeah, it's very, I allowed to say that's a good feeling because it's a good

851
00:51:34.60 --> 00:51:35.60
feeling.

852
00:51:35.60 --> 00:51:36.60
I'm sorry.

853
00:51:36.60 --> 00:51:40.52
Everyone, that's a good feeling when you know you're part of something that's, and

854
00:51:40.52 --> 00:51:44.80
you know, you do a great job in here discussing why we were going there.

855
00:51:44.80 --> 00:51:47.40
What type of person Sadama is it?

856
00:51:47.40 --> 00:51:49.80
It's a great section.

857
00:51:49.80 --> 00:51:53.48
And it's one of the reasons that makes the book powerful because you give some historical

858
00:51:53.48 --> 00:51:55.08
background about the whole situation.

859
00:51:55.08 --> 00:52:00.52
You explain who this guy was, what kind of, I can't even say what kind of person he was

860
00:52:00.52 --> 00:52:07.000
in animal, you know, he was an animal, his sons were just savages and they were horrible, evil

861
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.16
people.

862
00:52:08.16 --> 00:52:13.08
And so when I say it feels good, well, you, you've got to have that historical context

863
00:52:13.08 --> 00:52:17.84
about who the enemy is and then you realize, okay, we're going to liberate these people

864
00:52:17.84 --> 00:52:22.96
that have been living under this oppressive regime for decades and we're here.

865
00:52:22.96 --> 00:52:23.96
We can make this happen.

866
00:52:23.96 --> 00:52:24.96
Yeah.

867
00:52:24.96 --> 00:52:29.20
And yeah, you know what, that does feel really good, especially when we cross the border.

868
00:52:29.20 --> 00:52:34.40
When we started seeing people, they're welcome and saying, kids, literally, you would

869
00:52:34.40 --> 00:52:41.92
have these kids know shoes on their feet and you would not see a structure as far as the

870
00:52:41.92 --> 00:52:43.52
eye could see.

871
00:52:43.52 --> 00:52:49.000
You would not see a car or a donkey or motorcycle or nothing.

872
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:54.40
And they would walk all the way from wherever they came from all the way to meet us at

873
00:52:54.40 --> 00:52:58.60
the road and welcome and saying, and whenever we stop, because over there the alth

874
00:52:58.60 --> 00:53:02.52
convoyes were all mashed together and all jammed together so it would sit there.

875
00:53:02.52 --> 00:53:06.20
And they would even though we tried to keep them off our vehicles, they climbed up and

876
00:53:06.20 --> 00:53:11.32
they were so excited, they came up and was kissing our hands and, you know, kids were waving

877
00:53:11.32 --> 00:53:12.82
at us and stuff.

878
00:53:12.82 --> 00:53:16.60
And in one in particular, I wish I could find this picture.

879
00:53:16.60 --> 00:53:20.52
It was a little girl that they had dressed up in the best clothes that she had.

880
00:53:20.52 --> 00:53:29.24
She had a pink dress, white, frilly, frilly laces on it and white pattern leather shoes.

881
00:53:29.24 --> 00:53:33.16
And her dad was crouched down behind her and she was just waving at us.

882
00:53:33.16 --> 00:53:38.40
And I realized what that American flag means to them.

883
00:53:38.40 --> 00:53:44.56
Because these people back in 1992, revolted against Adon who's saying and he crushed that

884
00:53:44.56 --> 00:53:47.02
rebellion and diverted the U.F.

885
00:53:47.02 --> 00:53:52.66
and tigers rivers away from their homeland so they didn't have any form fields anymore.

886
00:53:52.66 --> 00:53:53.98
They didn't have anything.

887
00:53:53.98 --> 00:53:59.42
He was trying to snuff out a 5,000-year-old culture and that's what he was doing.

888
00:53:59.42 --> 00:54:07.34
So those people will work welcome at us in because we were their only hope at their survival

889
00:54:07.34 --> 00:54:08.74
of their culture.

890
00:54:08.74 --> 00:54:14.06
And then at that moment, it just struck me.

891
00:54:14.06 --> 00:54:20.86
Wow, we are here for them and we are that American flag means something.

892
00:54:20.86 --> 00:54:24.14
So something that people take for granted every day.

893
00:54:24.14 --> 00:54:30.14
You go down the street, you see it over there outside of a building or people's front yards.

894
00:54:30.14 --> 00:54:39.50
And you don't realize how impactful, how powerful that symbol is until you see somebody

895
00:54:39.50 --> 00:54:47.50
who is literally, their culture is weathering away and we were their only hope and it was just

896
00:54:47.50 --> 00:54:50.38
incredible.

897
00:54:50.38 --> 00:54:54.18
And as I said, that feels good.

898
00:54:54.18 --> 00:54:59.90
And you have to know that context but that feels good to be a part of that.

899
00:54:59.90 --> 00:55:01.18
No doubt about it.

900
00:55:01.18 --> 00:55:08.22
I guess I'm not apologetic for that.

901
00:55:08.22 --> 00:55:10.74
You guys are moving forward now.

902
00:55:10.74 --> 00:55:14.54
Our ground pounders up front were putting a world of hurt on those Iraqi combatants who decided

903
00:55:14.54 --> 00:55:15.54
to stay in fight.

904
00:55:15.54 --> 00:55:19.82
We passed Iraqi tanks and armored troop carriers that seem to be knocked out effortlessly

905
00:55:19.82 --> 00:55:23.34
by the Marines ahead of us, somewhere still on fire with rounds popping and snapping

906
00:55:23.34 --> 00:55:24.34
inside them.

907
00:55:24.34 --> 00:55:28.98
Some had their turrets slapped off their chaffets, chasses with a steam of curling smoke rising

908
00:55:28.98 --> 00:55:30.78
from their mechanical guts.

909
00:55:30.78 --> 00:55:35.18
Shot up pickup trucks with mounted machine guns were leaking engine food, mixing with blood

910
00:55:35.18 --> 00:55:37.06
of their former occupants.

911
00:55:37.06 --> 00:55:41.62
But it seemed like the large black flies knew that Task Force Ripper was in town.

912
00:55:41.62 --> 00:55:45.26
They had been waiting patiently for the enemy dead and by the time we had passed the

913
00:55:45.26 --> 00:55:51.26
remains a small black, small cloud of black flies had already began to their feasts.

914
00:55:51.26 --> 00:55:56.26
The sight of the enemy dead was so routine that they no longer captured our attention.

915
00:55:56.26 --> 00:56:02.54
They became as common as roadkill back home and regarded the same way in consequential.

916
00:56:02.54 --> 00:56:07.06
It was truly a sight to see because no matter what direction one was to look along that

917
00:56:07.06 --> 00:56:09.06
road, all one saw was the finest.

918
00:56:09.06 --> 00:56:13.86
The world's finest fighting force moving north toward Baghdad, removing all Saddam's

919
00:56:13.86 --> 00:56:23.06
bathest henchmen and waving all at all the friendly people rejoicing in the streets.

920
00:56:23.06 --> 00:56:27.50
And now you get into this and I remember when this happened from state side.

921
00:56:27.50 --> 00:56:31.62
A tempest wind started to blow gradually, increasing with strength, this time progressed and

922
00:56:31.62 --> 00:56:36.66
whipped up loose sand and rocks into the air, painting the scorching hot gusts of wind

923
00:56:36.66 --> 00:56:40.26
into an ever darker shade of orange and red.

924
00:56:40.26 --> 00:56:44.30
It was a storm unlike anything that I'd ever seen and I would consider it as close to

925
00:56:44.30 --> 00:56:48.06
what I'd imagined a windstorm of biblical proportions to be.

926
00:56:48.06 --> 00:56:53.50
The order was passed to halt in place after a rumor that an M1 Abrams tank was lost crossing

927
00:56:53.50 --> 00:56:55.54
the Euphrates River.

928
00:56:55.54 --> 00:56:59.90
Visibility beyond ten feet became impossible and it was hard to tell if a dark shade of

929
00:56:59.90 --> 00:57:03.70
red was a vehicle cruising by or dust in the wind.

930
00:57:03.70 --> 00:57:07.86
Some of the speeding trucks almost rammed into us as we stopped coming less than ten feet

931
00:57:07.86 --> 00:57:11.06
from our trailer before they swirfed.

932
00:57:11.06 --> 00:57:12.62
So you guys are in that massive storm.

933
00:57:12.62 --> 00:57:15.98
I remember watching the news as everyone was pushing up all of a sudden was a all stop.

934
00:57:15.98 --> 00:57:16.98
Yeah.

935
00:57:16.98 --> 00:57:19.34
And everybody was, everybody was on top of everybody.

936
00:57:19.34 --> 00:57:22.70
We could have no idea who everybody was next to us.

937
00:57:22.70 --> 00:57:28.74
Literally a vehicle passed by and would not see you until it was almost too late.

938
00:57:28.74 --> 00:57:33.38
We couldn't go out beyond an armed distance because it was that bad.

939
00:57:33.38 --> 00:57:34.98
I had never seen anything.

940
00:57:34.98 --> 00:57:38.34
It was just a gigantic wall of orange dirt.

941
00:57:38.34 --> 00:57:40.50
Did it come in one wall?

942
00:57:40.50 --> 00:57:41.50
No, no.

943
00:57:41.50 --> 00:57:43.30
It started off slow.

944
00:57:43.30 --> 00:57:48.42
The winds started picking up and it was like, no, okay, now it's starting to get that.

945
00:57:48.42 --> 00:57:53.10
You know, you put your arms up like this and you can start to pick up your suit and start

946
00:57:53.10 --> 00:57:55.74
doing this stuff here and open up.

947
00:57:55.74 --> 00:58:03.50
And then it just got brown and then darker, then orange and then red and then so thick

948
00:58:03.50 --> 00:58:06.70
you couldn't see anything.

949
00:58:06.70 --> 00:58:09.78
And it literally felt like it was piercing my mom's suit.

950
00:58:09.78 --> 00:58:14.06
It was that strong and it was miserable.

951
00:58:14.06 --> 00:58:17.26
And how long were you guys laid up for?

952
00:58:17.26 --> 00:58:19.74
For three days, three days.

953
00:58:19.74 --> 00:58:21.46
We moved very next day.

954
00:58:21.46 --> 00:58:22.46
Okay.

955
00:58:22.46 --> 00:58:23.46
So it was just all the next day.

956
00:58:23.46 --> 00:58:24.46
Right.

957
00:58:24.46 --> 00:58:28.82
So it had that sandstorm that hole night.

958
00:58:28.82 --> 00:58:36.90
And then after that, our tent, our tent, our canvas for our five-ton ripped and it was

959
00:58:36.90 --> 00:58:41.58
blowing in the wind and we had no place to hide and all the sudden it started raining

960
00:58:41.58 --> 00:58:42.58
on us.

961
00:58:42.58 --> 00:58:48.90
The whole grain and we just sat there and just took it and it was miserable.

962
00:58:48.90 --> 00:58:51.58
All the weapons were jammed up full of food.

963
00:58:51.58 --> 00:58:54.42
It looked like wet concrete coming out of those things.

964
00:58:54.42 --> 00:59:03.06
And then we realized that we were still surrounded by baguettes with AKs and RPKs and RPGs

965
00:59:03.06 --> 00:59:07.10
and we knew that their weapons were working this stuff.

966
00:59:07.10 --> 00:59:11.46
And ours has a little bit of a problem with what concrete and something.

967
00:59:11.46 --> 00:59:14.86
So yeah, it's hit freaking sucked.

968
00:59:14.86 --> 00:59:23.06
But we moved the very next day and it was all all a gigantic wall of fog.

969
00:59:23.06 --> 00:59:27.50
Whether it is not cooperates, Murphy's law.

970
00:59:27.50 --> 00:59:31.78
So you say it didn't take too long, but the kinks of the overlapping convoys were slowly

971
00:59:31.78 --> 00:59:35.54
worked out and we were off this time swirling curtains of a delicate mist.

972
00:59:35.54 --> 00:59:38.58
It was impossible to figure out exactly where everybody was in relation to us.

973
00:59:38.58 --> 00:59:39.82
The fog was way too thick.

974
00:59:39.82 --> 00:59:42.54
Our units were strewn out and visibility was at a minimum.

975
00:59:42.54 --> 00:59:46.58
The only way that we could make it through this area expeditiously was to provide our own

976
00:59:46.58 --> 00:59:49.54
security as our convoys leap frog each other.

977
00:59:49.54 --> 00:59:53.62
And that our convoys would hold and punch out Marines to provide security.

978
00:59:53.62 --> 00:59:59.10
And then the convoys behind us would leap frog through us and stop once through our lines

979
00:59:59.10 --> 01:00:00.82
and provide security for us.

980
01:00:00.82 --> 01:00:05.14
It was an all day affair of getting out our vehicles quickly setting up and to provide

981
01:00:05.14 --> 01:00:09.50
security within a reasonable distance to allow communications but to be dispersing off that

982
01:00:09.50 --> 01:00:13.54
one mortar RPG round couldn't take out multiple Marines.

983
01:00:13.54 --> 01:00:18.18
One signaled, we would mount back up, take accountability to ensure that no one was left

984
01:00:18.18 --> 01:00:19.62
behind and roll out.

985
01:00:19.62 --> 01:00:21.26
So this is just classic cover move.

986
01:00:21.26 --> 01:00:22.26
Right.

987
01:00:22.26 --> 01:00:27.06
I always have to highlight a little cover move.

988
01:00:27.06 --> 01:00:29.70
And then at one point it was once again our turn to provide security.

989
01:00:29.70 --> 01:00:32.90
The Marines got down, taking up their normal positions just as they had done does it's

990
01:00:32.90 --> 01:00:36.66
the times thus day that far.

991
01:00:36.66 --> 01:00:43.10
The first sergeant screamed contact rear, contact rear, 100% get off the fucking trucks.

992
01:00:43.10 --> 01:00:45.18
Contact rear with the hell is he talking oh shit.

993
01:00:45.18 --> 01:00:47.22
I was in denial that we were actually being shot at.

994
01:00:47.22 --> 01:00:51.38
I grabbed my helmet and rifle and then quickly jumped down onto the asphalt and looked

995
01:00:51.38 --> 01:00:56.14
for any micro terrain that I hoped would serve to shield me against incoming gunfire.

996
01:00:56.14 --> 01:01:02.02
The reports increased slowly and built up tempo like popcorn popping in a microwave.

997
01:01:02.02 --> 01:01:05.22
The order was given a form of straight line 90 degrees off the highways so that we could

998
01:01:05.22 --> 01:01:09.22
trap the enemy in a L shape, otherwise known as a crossfire.

999
01:01:09.22 --> 01:01:13.82
They say that you never know how you will react in combat until it happens to you.

1000
01:01:13.82 --> 01:01:18.34
I could hear others nervously cracking jokes, one guy to my left by the road was vomiting

1001
01:01:18.34 --> 01:01:23.26
and one guy further down the line from me said that he had shid his pants.

1002
01:01:23.26 --> 01:01:26.74
I've never found out if that was true if he was just joking.

1003
01:01:26.74 --> 01:01:28.38
But who would want to find out?

1004
01:01:28.38 --> 01:01:33.14
It sounds silly now but all the training that those drill instructors at Paris Island

1005
01:01:33.14 --> 01:01:38.54
had pounded in my head 10 years earlier had kicked in and I was in calm and as focus as I

1006
01:01:38.54 --> 01:01:39.54
could be.

1007
01:01:39.54 --> 01:01:41.50
I just sang a little country song to myself.

1008
01:01:41.50 --> 01:01:46.30
The same one that the troops were singing just a short bit before Travis Trits.

1009
01:01:46.30 --> 01:01:49.06
It's a great day to be alive.

1010
01:01:49.06 --> 01:01:53.38
I quickly checked, rechecked and tripled check my fundamentals of marksmanship, proper body

1011
01:01:53.38 --> 01:01:58.06
alignment, proper breath control, found my natural point of aim and ensure that my magazines

1012
01:01:58.06 --> 01:01:59.74
were readily available.

1013
01:01:59.74 --> 01:02:03.98
This was my one time my one opportunity to get some.

1014
01:02:03.98 --> 01:02:07.10
So don't fail, don't fuck up and don't die.

1015
01:02:07.10 --> 01:02:11.86
A marine from the convoy further down for me was in a full on hyperventilating panic.

1016
01:02:11.86 --> 01:02:15.94
She was in the prone position, her weapon laid impently in the sand before her.

1017
01:02:15.94 --> 01:02:20.14
Her hands cubs her face as she tried to hold back uncontrollable tears.

1018
01:02:20.14 --> 01:02:23.26
We tried desperately to calm her down shouting words of encouragement.

1019
01:02:23.26 --> 01:02:27.78
Now we were down one gun for this fight and peering into a fog that held actively

1020
01:02:27.78 --> 01:02:30.10
that held an actively engaging force.

1021
01:02:30.10 --> 01:02:34.98
The an urge to walk over to her and put that M16 into her arms had only been stopped

1022
01:02:34.98 --> 01:02:37.50
by the increasing tempo of the incoming rounds.

1023
01:02:37.50 --> 01:02:43.30
The 762 by 39 rounds it formed into black streaks against the white background of the fog.

1024
01:02:43.30 --> 01:02:46.78
When the rounds got close they sounded like angry hornets just overhead.

1025
01:02:46.78 --> 01:02:50.70
When they got too close they snapped as loud as black cat firecrackers, which left

1026
01:02:50.70 --> 01:02:52.74
a high pitched wine in my ears.

1027
01:02:52.74 --> 01:02:57.42
Rocket propelled grenades flew between us and exploded off in the opaque mist behind the

1028
01:02:57.42 --> 01:02:58.98
form of our formation.

1029
01:02:58.98 --> 01:03:03.02
If we were to meet the enemy, let them come.

1030
01:03:03.02 --> 01:03:05.58
Marines on the line started congratulating each other.

1031
01:03:05.58 --> 01:03:09.98
Pre-maturely yelling out, hell yeah, Marines combat action ribbons.

1032
01:03:09.98 --> 01:03:12.82
Silhouettes faded in and out of the mist as the fog shifted.

1033
01:03:12.82 --> 01:03:13.82
It was very confusing.

1034
01:03:13.82 --> 01:03:17.58
Am I conserved over a concerned, friendly fire situation?

1035
01:03:17.58 --> 01:03:19.86
I knew where we were.

1036
01:03:19.86 --> 01:03:22.86
I knew where the road was so that was the base of fire.

1037
01:03:22.86 --> 01:03:25.78
But I had no idea what the other convoy was doing.

1038
01:03:25.78 --> 01:03:28.50
Were they setting out an L-shaped on their side?

1039
01:03:28.50 --> 01:03:31.94
Were they locating, closing with, and destroying the enemy by fire and maneuver?

1040
01:03:31.94 --> 01:03:34.74
Were they going to do squad rushes into the Iraqi positions?

1041
01:03:34.74 --> 01:03:36.78
Therefore crossing into our fields of fire.

1042
01:03:36.78 --> 01:03:38.90
At that point I had no idea.

1043
01:03:38.90 --> 01:03:43.10
I was absolutely positive that I did not want to shoot at a silhouette and have it turn

1044
01:03:43.10 --> 01:03:46.90
out to be one of our Marines hooking and jabbing with a bad guy.

1045
01:03:46.90 --> 01:03:51.94
Okay, somebody figured this shit out so we can pop these dudes.

1046
01:03:51.94 --> 01:03:55.86
Then out of nowhere there was a boom that shook the ground, followed by a quick rocket

1047
01:03:55.86 --> 01:03:56.86
sound.

1048
01:03:56.86 --> 01:03:58.50
I screamed out what the fuck was that?

1049
01:03:58.50 --> 01:04:03.42
I was afraid an RPG would hit an ammunition laden truck on the road and have all those

1050
01:04:03.42 --> 01:04:07.94
155 millimeter artillery rounds explode just dozens of yards away.

1051
01:04:07.94 --> 01:04:10.74
A voice called out from the road and said, it's okay.

1052
01:04:10.74 --> 01:04:13.06
We are hitting them with tow missiles.

1053
01:04:13.06 --> 01:04:17.14
Apparently anti tank missiles on top of the gun trucks had thermal vision capability

1054
01:04:17.14 --> 01:04:19.50
which the gunner just happened to exploit.

1055
01:04:19.50 --> 01:04:24.42
The tow gunner was pointing out to which area to shoot and some of the Marines on the line

1056
01:04:24.42 --> 01:04:26.82
started to fire a few rounds in that general direction.

1057
01:04:26.82 --> 01:04:30.34
I could see shadows in the shifting mist but I still didn't want to shoot one of our

1058
01:04:30.34 --> 01:04:35.82
Marines by mistake.

1059
01:04:35.82 --> 01:04:40.30
The first sergeant yelled out, you first five Marines shift fire to the left, get up and

1060
01:04:40.30 --> 01:04:41.90
move toward the road.

1061
01:04:41.90 --> 01:04:43.50
They're going to try and cut us off.

1062
01:04:43.50 --> 01:04:45.66
We repeated the command shift fire left.

1063
01:04:45.66 --> 01:04:47.50
I wait a minute, stop.

1064
01:04:47.50 --> 01:04:48.50
I looked to my left.

1065
01:04:48.50 --> 01:04:49.50
I looked to my right.

1066
01:04:49.50 --> 01:04:52.78
The incoming machine gun fire made a roaring past my head and made me feel like a gigantic

1067
01:04:52.78 --> 01:04:53.78
target.

1068
01:04:53.78 --> 01:04:55.82
I just wished I could crawl up inside my helmet.

1069
01:04:55.82 --> 01:05:00.66
I had to do a gut check and remember saying to myself, well Chris, you've lifted

1070
01:05:00.66 --> 01:05:01.66
good life.

1071
01:05:01.66 --> 01:05:02.66
Fuck it.

1072
01:05:02.66 --> 01:05:04.86
And I resigned myself to the winds of fate and the hands of God.

1073
01:05:04.86 --> 01:05:06.74
I just got up and ran as hard as I could.

1074
01:05:06.74 --> 01:05:11.06
But it was one of those little moments in time when life flashes before your eyes and

1075
01:05:11.06 --> 01:05:14.58
time seems to slow the fuck down.

1076
01:05:14.58 --> 01:05:18.46
The angry black streaking hornet seemed to get a little closer and the mud seemed to get

1077
01:05:18.46 --> 01:05:19.46
thicker.

1078
01:05:19.46 --> 01:05:23.02
My boots seemed as if I had a heavy cast iron weights tied to my legs.

1079
01:05:23.02 --> 01:05:27.34
I could now see the first former reinstarting to hit the deck and low crawled to cover with

1080
01:05:27.34 --> 01:05:29.46
splashes of impacts dancing around them.

1081
01:05:29.46 --> 01:05:33.30
For a moment I had cursed myself and started to wish that I hadn't been so motivated

1082
01:05:33.30 --> 01:05:35.78
when all this started and ran so far out.

1083
01:05:35.78 --> 01:05:40.30
I looked over to my right toward the enemy and snap around almost hit me in the helmet.

1084
01:05:40.30 --> 01:05:44.62
God damn I yelled to myself and automatically my body went to the ground.

1085
01:05:44.62 --> 01:05:48.46
But before my left hand could reach the ground, snap another round almost hit me in the face.

1086
01:05:48.46 --> 01:05:49.46
Fuck.

1087
01:05:49.46 --> 01:05:52.02
A couple more rounds snapped around me as I hide crawled.

1088
01:05:52.02 --> 01:05:53.50
Like I never hide crawled before.

1089
01:05:53.50 --> 01:05:57.62
I got to my destination behind a pile of mud and I just lay there looking at the former

1090
01:05:57.62 --> 01:05:59.06
Marines who were watching me.

1091
01:05:59.06 --> 01:06:01.42
PFC Raim was said, holy shit sergeant.

1092
01:06:01.42 --> 01:06:04.18
I saw those rounds coming out of the fog and I thought I was going to watch you get

1093
01:06:04.18 --> 01:06:05.82
shot in the face.

1094
01:06:05.82 --> 01:06:07.82
Yeah, holy shit.

1095
01:06:07.82 --> 01:06:13.30
So did I Raim was.

1096
01:06:13.30 --> 01:06:18.22
And that's a detailed description and I actually skipped the bottom.

1097
01:06:18.22 --> 01:06:23.46
There's some great details in there. You end up talking to another kid from where's he

1098
01:06:23.46 --> 01:06:24.46
from?

1099
01:06:24.46 --> 01:06:25.46
Was he from Ty?

1100
01:06:25.46 --> 01:06:26.46
He was from Cambodia.

1101
01:06:26.46 --> 01:06:29.02
He was the skate cam in the family of Skate cam.

1102
01:06:29.02 --> 01:06:32.14
And they lived in the refugee camp on the Thai border.

1103
01:06:32.14 --> 01:06:37.42
He comes up, I run down there and he looks at me because hey, you look like you like

1104
01:06:37.42 --> 01:06:38.42
a Southeast Asian.

1105
01:06:38.42 --> 01:06:40.42
Yeah, my mom's from Thailand.

1106
01:06:40.42 --> 01:06:42.94
But yeah, it's white and today I'm here I am.

1107
01:06:42.94 --> 01:06:45.70
So we were just catching up and see how you doing.

1108
01:06:45.70 --> 01:06:50.86
You know, meeting in my ramos is like, hey, how the hell can you guys talk about that

1109
01:06:50.86 --> 01:06:51.86
shit right now?

1110
01:06:51.86 --> 01:06:52.86
Can you just see what's going on?

1111
01:06:52.86 --> 01:06:56.14
And I was like, well, shit, if I'm going to fight and die, my husband will know the

1112
01:06:56.14 --> 01:06:57.14
guy next to me.

1113
01:06:57.14 --> 01:06:58.14
Right on.

1114
01:06:58.14 --> 01:06:59.14
Yeah.

1115
01:06:59.14 --> 01:07:02.38
Uh, continue it on.

1116
01:07:02.38 --> 01:07:06.78
At that point, the ground started to rumble and shake and down the road came a couple

1117
01:07:06.78 --> 01:07:13.78
of M1 Abrams tank and a couple of amphibious assault vehicles which split off the road into

1118
01:07:13.78 --> 01:07:17.90
the fog, the tank commander on the lead tank was firing as mob dues 50 caliber machine

1119
01:07:17.90 --> 01:07:22.66
gun in the main gun shot off around into the fog, illuminating his tank in the mist.

1120
01:07:22.66 --> 01:07:26.50
Our convoy, the passing convoy and these tanks and tracks had become intertwined and they

1121
01:07:26.50 --> 01:07:30.50
were dispersing a lethal mixture of chaos and hellfire.

1122
01:07:30.50 --> 01:07:34.62
On the receiving end of this was an enemy that had clearly picked the wrong marines to shoot

1123
01:07:34.62 --> 01:07:35.62
at.

1124
01:07:35.62 --> 01:07:39.78
And enthusiastically given base of fire and crushing armored counterattack from the nation's

1125
01:07:39.78 --> 01:07:45.86
finest had been something to behold in person and I wanted to witness more.

1126
01:07:45.86 --> 01:07:53.70
You know, I always try and profess my love for the tankers and that's the type of situation.

1127
01:07:53.70 --> 01:07:56.90
When you hear tanks coming, it is glorious.

1128
01:07:56.90 --> 01:07:57.90
Oh, yes.

1129
01:07:57.90 --> 01:08:02.54
I can say from my own experiences that I love tankers.

1130
01:08:02.54 --> 01:08:03.54
I love tankers.

1131
01:08:03.54 --> 01:08:04.54
Yeah.

1132
01:08:04.54 --> 01:08:09.74
There's a few times that they definitely was very welcome down to the battlefield.

1133
01:08:09.74 --> 01:08:12.10
Yeah, that's a classic.

1134
01:08:12.10 --> 01:08:17.90
You're in a gunfight and you get your brothers to bring a tank to a gunfight.

1135
01:08:17.90 --> 01:08:19.10
That's a beautiful thing.

1136
01:08:19.10 --> 01:08:21.74
Because at that point it was all foggy.

1137
01:08:21.74 --> 01:08:23.34
Nobody knew where everybody was.

1138
01:08:23.34 --> 01:08:30.98
We still kind of separate ourselves and all the grunts and all the tanks were way ahead of

1139
01:08:30.98 --> 01:08:31.98
us.

1140
01:08:31.98 --> 01:08:35.22
So when we started getting hit, they're like, oh, there's a unit out there where we're

1141
01:08:35.22 --> 01:08:36.22
forgot.

1142
01:08:36.22 --> 01:08:38.18
So we routed them and thank God.

1143
01:08:38.18 --> 01:08:40.66
They got there right at the right time.

1144
01:08:40.66 --> 01:08:47.06
And yeah, took them out and we ended up being dug in on the side of the road a couple

1145
01:08:47.06 --> 01:08:48.06
days.

1146
01:08:48.06 --> 01:08:52.70
And the guy who the tank commander came up jumped in my hole and thanked me for pointing

1147
01:08:52.70 --> 01:08:53.70
out the bad guy.

1148
01:08:53.70 --> 01:08:54.70
Right.

1149
01:08:54.70 --> 01:08:56.30
Yeah, that makes 84 us now.

1150
01:08:56.30 --> 01:08:57.30
Right.

1151
01:08:57.30 --> 01:09:01.34
Yeah, you know, you were also, I got to give you a lot of credit because you were very

1152
01:09:01.34 --> 01:09:04.10
cognizant of the confusion.

1153
01:09:04.10 --> 01:09:05.10
Right.

1154
01:09:05.10 --> 01:09:09.42
I said this before in a money there was times where there was blue on blues with Humvie

1155
01:09:09.42 --> 01:09:14.46
versus Humvie, which is, which just should, I mean, there's no more recognizable vehicle

1156
01:09:14.46 --> 01:09:16.14
in the world than Humvie.

1157
01:09:16.14 --> 01:09:17.82
And the enemy does not have Humvies.

1158
01:09:17.82 --> 01:09:23.90
So can you imagine the mindset of a soldier to shoot at another Humvie?

1159
01:09:23.90 --> 01:09:27.74
Like that's what can happen when things start getting crazy.

1160
01:09:27.74 --> 01:09:32.22
And the user, you were really aware of the fact that, hey, look, I don't know where everyone

1161
01:09:32.22 --> 01:09:33.22
is.

1162
01:09:33.22 --> 01:09:34.22
Right.

1163
01:09:34.22 --> 01:09:35.22
My self-injection.

1164
01:09:35.22 --> 01:09:36.22
I stay calm.

1165
01:09:36.22 --> 01:09:37.22
Yeah.

1166
01:09:37.22 --> 01:09:46.06
And that's one thing that I, I, I, I, I, I just thank my drone structures for because

1167
01:09:46.06 --> 01:09:53.34
they pound it in our heads that all this chaos wars that war is chaos.

1168
01:09:53.34 --> 01:09:55.34
It is confusion.

1169
01:09:55.34 --> 01:09:59.94
You're trying to make you panic as long as you don't panic and keep your head above

1170
01:09:59.94 --> 01:10:02.98
the water and not sink and keep on fighting.

1171
01:10:02.98 --> 01:10:04.70
No, stay in there.

1172
01:10:04.70 --> 01:10:05.94
No, get into that mode.

1173
01:10:05.94 --> 01:10:07.74
Slow your heartbeat down.

1174
01:10:07.74 --> 01:10:09.58
Make good decisions.

1175
01:10:09.58 --> 01:10:16.30
And no, I, I learned that from from my senior, you know, instructor from Hube, now I stay

1176
01:10:16.30 --> 01:10:20.10
in contact with, which is pretty crazy.

1177
01:10:20.10 --> 01:10:24.02
And yeah, I took that onto the battlefield and when everybody else is panic around,

1178
01:10:24.02 --> 01:10:26.86
you know, it's just seeing Travis Tritt to myself.

1179
01:10:26.86 --> 01:10:29.70
And, okay, here's my ammo.

1180
01:10:29.70 --> 01:10:30.70
All right.

1181
01:10:30.70 --> 01:10:34.74
You know, okay, my point of aim, shift it, I'm good to go.

1182
01:10:34.74 --> 01:10:35.74
Anybody pops up there?

1183
01:10:35.74 --> 01:10:36.74
I got him.

1184
01:10:36.74 --> 01:10:37.74
Yeah.

1185
01:10:37.74 --> 01:10:42.86
That ability to take a step back to attach from all that craziness, mayhem.

1186
01:10:42.86 --> 01:10:46.30
That's the difference between having a blue on blue for after sight and not, that's, that's

1187
01:10:46.30 --> 01:10:48.06
the difference right there.

1188
01:10:48.06 --> 01:10:53.50
You, especially being all excited being your first time in combat, that, the kind of

1189
01:10:53.50 --> 01:10:57.50
thing that leads to that excitement, you get wrapped up around that emotion and all

1190
01:10:57.50 --> 01:11:01.30
so you all cool, I got a target for the first time in my life, I'm going to take this shot.

1191
01:11:01.30 --> 01:11:02.90
And then you, you realize it's a bad shot.

1192
01:11:02.90 --> 01:11:07.78
It's the most horrible thing that could happen in no matter what you do not ever want

1193
01:11:07.78 --> 01:11:09.94
to put yourself in that situation.

1194
01:11:09.94 --> 01:11:14.46
It's better to make sure that what you're shooting at is a legitimate target than

1195
01:11:14.46 --> 01:11:16.82
make the wrong decision.

1196
01:11:16.82 --> 01:11:19.42
First of all, somebody, their lives.

1197
01:11:19.42 --> 01:11:20.42
Yeah.

1198
01:11:20.42 --> 01:11:24.34
Well, you did, the people that trained you did good and you did good.

1199
01:11:24.34 --> 01:11:26.34
That's the Marine Corps does.

1200
01:11:26.34 --> 01:11:31.22
Moving forward a little with the instructors, the big fighting positions, it called our

1201
01:11:31.22 --> 01:11:33.58
new phase of war and operational halt.

1202
01:11:33.58 --> 01:11:37.22
This meant that all Ford progress had stopped in the latest greatest from the powers

1203
01:11:37.22 --> 01:11:43.50
that be said that the Grashans were to be cut to only two MREs a day and our fresh water

1204
01:11:43.50 --> 01:11:47.18
had been depleted.

1205
01:11:47.18 --> 01:11:48.50
Out of fresh water, huh?

1206
01:11:48.50 --> 01:11:52.54
Yeah, everything they were given us, tasted like bleach.

1207
01:11:52.54 --> 01:11:57.22
You were pumping it straight out of the water that was around us and they dumped all the bleach

1208
01:11:57.22 --> 01:11:59.66
in there and it was basically drinking laundry water.

1209
01:11:59.66 --> 01:12:01.10
It was nasty.

1210
01:12:01.10 --> 01:12:09.86
But, you know, that one thing, one thing, when you get in fights, for me, I stopped becoming

1211
01:12:09.86 --> 01:12:10.86
hungry.

1212
01:12:10.86 --> 01:12:12.46
I didn't care about eating.

1213
01:12:12.46 --> 01:12:13.46
I just needed water.

1214
01:12:13.46 --> 01:12:14.46
Yeah, boom.

1215
01:12:14.46 --> 01:12:18.62
The thirst is not, you can't go without water that's right.

1216
01:12:18.62 --> 01:12:19.62
Right.

1217
01:12:19.62 --> 01:12:20.62
So you can go long time without food.

1218
01:12:20.62 --> 01:12:21.62
Right.

1219
01:12:21.62 --> 01:12:27.98
I'm going to fast forward a little bit here, but I thought this was an important section.

1220
01:12:27.98 --> 01:12:29.74
You get into an area.

1221
01:12:29.74 --> 01:12:36.34
I think it was by Nazaria and you are kind of pushing through an area where there was

1222
01:12:36.34 --> 01:12:38.02
a bunch of dead Iraqi soldiers.

1223
01:12:38.02 --> 01:12:43.06
By the time you guys got showed up, by the time you showed up there and you are talking

1224
01:12:43.06 --> 01:12:46.42
on one of the Marines that's there and you said, do you know if these were Republican

1225
01:12:46.42 --> 01:12:49.70
guard or Fed Aien Saddam?

1226
01:12:49.70 --> 01:12:55.34
And so at this time, those were kind of the Republican guard was kind of this allegedly

1227
01:12:55.34 --> 01:13:03.10
elite unit of Iraqis and the Fed Aien Saddam was this other group of, and you know, you

1228
01:13:03.10 --> 01:13:07.14
heard that they were criminals and they were thugs and they were mergers and they were completely

1229
01:13:07.14 --> 01:13:08.94
loyal to Saddam.

1230
01:13:08.94 --> 01:13:13.26
And so I know when I got over there, it was all about hey, are these guys Fed Aien Saddam?

1231
01:13:13.26 --> 01:13:15.86
It was this big kind of deal.

1232
01:13:15.86 --> 01:13:20.90
So you're asking the guy who these dead do these dead enemy were, what was it Republican

1233
01:13:20.90 --> 01:13:22.54
guard or Fed Aien Saddam?

1234
01:13:22.54 --> 01:13:29.22
And he says fucking conscripts brother, the grunts over there captured a Fed Aien officer,

1235
01:13:29.22 --> 01:13:32.58
the other night after their attack and he spilled the beans.

1236
01:13:32.58 --> 01:13:35.66
He said that all these dead guys were forced to fight us.

1237
01:13:35.66 --> 01:13:40.14
The Fed Aien Saddam had gone through the local town back there and recruited these guys

1238
01:13:40.14 --> 01:13:41.58
by gunpoint.

1239
01:13:41.58 --> 01:13:44.46
If they'd refused, they would shoot their children.

1240
01:13:44.46 --> 01:13:47.54
So there was a ton of suit cases on the other side of the berm.

1241
01:13:47.54 --> 01:13:49.86
They brought them because they didn't know how long they were going to be away from

1242
01:13:49.86 --> 01:13:50.86
home.

1243
01:13:50.86 --> 01:13:52.30
And there are some brief cases over there too.

1244
01:13:52.30 --> 01:13:55.42
Some of these guys were recruited right off their boss on the way to work.

1245
01:13:55.42 --> 01:13:59.26
These poor guys were just given uniforms and weapons and forced to attack us.

1246
01:13:59.26 --> 01:14:04.82
If they were to turn around, that captured officer was supposed to execute them.

1247
01:14:04.82 --> 01:14:11.14
But the dumbass was too chicken shit to go down with his troops.

1248
01:14:11.14 --> 01:14:18.54
So again, I just had to call that out because that's the kind of evil regime that was

1249
01:14:18.54 --> 01:14:19.74
in Iraq.

1250
01:14:19.74 --> 01:14:23.14
Just forcing people, you can come fight or we're going to kill your children.

1251
01:14:23.14 --> 01:14:25.14
And that's why a lot of them surrendered as well.

1252
01:14:25.14 --> 01:14:28.66
I mean, there's a ton of Iraqis that surrendered at the beginning of the work as they

1253
01:14:28.66 --> 01:14:32.90
were in those situations.

1254
01:14:32.90 --> 01:14:35.66
Continue on the fighting to Baghdad was prevalent on everybody's mind.

1255
01:14:35.66 --> 01:14:38.62
And every single one of us knew that it was going to be a hell of a fight.

1256
01:14:38.62 --> 01:14:41.90
It was sad to know that several of those Marines would not survive that battle.

1257
01:14:41.90 --> 01:14:46.06
And I meant to be prepared myself for the worst case scenario.

1258
01:14:46.06 --> 01:14:51.38
So you guys are thinking Baghdad is going to be a big ball game there.

1259
01:14:51.38 --> 01:14:54.42
Right, at that moment, we were fighting in Nigeria.

1260
01:14:54.42 --> 01:14:59.70
So we had a whole task force that was bogged down down there.

1261
01:14:59.70 --> 01:15:03.10
And we knew that Baghdad was going to be one hell of a fight.

1262
01:15:03.10 --> 01:15:05.62
It's the biggest city of the entire country.

1263
01:15:05.62 --> 01:15:10.06
So yeah, it was going to be street to street fighting, house to house fighting.

1264
01:15:10.06 --> 01:15:13.74
And there was a little taste of that in Nigeria.

1265
01:15:13.74 --> 01:15:16.90
And I remember reading the reports and it was like bogged down.

1266
01:15:16.90 --> 01:15:23.54
And Nigeria was like legitimate military operations, military and fighting.

1267
01:15:23.54 --> 01:15:25.70
And you get a little taste of that and you realize what that's going to be like.

1268
01:15:25.70 --> 01:15:30.14
And then you look at Baghdad with whatever six million people.

1269
01:15:30.14 --> 01:15:35.58
You've got to think, you're thinking this is going to be a bloodbath.

1270
01:15:35.58 --> 01:15:39.10
Fast forward a little bit.

1271
01:15:39.10 --> 01:15:41.62
Our time with Task Force Tarwood come to an end.

1272
01:15:41.62 --> 01:15:48.22
And we were to detach ourselves from their convoy once we hit LSA Chestie and old Iraqi Air Force

1273
01:15:48.22 --> 01:15:51.22
base a few miles southeast of Outcut.

1274
01:15:51.22 --> 01:15:53.10
And again, I fast forward to this point.

1275
01:15:53.10 --> 01:15:56.86
By the standards of what we've been used to, this base was absolutely huge.

1276
01:15:56.86 --> 01:16:01.66
The CBZ had done a great job building the hard pack earth and runway for our C130 Hercules

1277
01:16:01.66 --> 01:16:02.66
cargo plants.

1278
01:16:02.66 --> 01:16:07.22
We could hear their engines roar across the base and it was a wonderful sound because

1279
01:16:07.22 --> 01:16:10.02
it meant supplies were coming in.

1280
01:16:10.02 --> 01:16:13.30
As I started an Anderson's team was already there and it was a great surprise to see

1281
01:16:13.30 --> 01:16:14.30
them again.

1282
01:16:14.30 --> 01:16:16.42
Dude, they've got showers here.

1283
01:16:16.42 --> 01:16:17.98
Everybody instantly got excited.

1284
01:16:17.98 --> 01:16:23.66
We had spent the past 23 days living in dirt and filth, sweating profusely under

1285
01:16:23.66 --> 01:16:25.14
a thick mop suits.

1286
01:16:25.14 --> 01:16:29.14
My hair had been matted down by wearing my Kevlar helmet and it was a thick greasy

1287
01:16:29.14 --> 01:16:31.98
layer of sand stuck to my scalp.

1288
01:16:31.98 --> 01:16:36.42
I think that I had sanded in every orifice of my body and as I looked upon that beautiful

1289
01:16:36.42 --> 01:16:39.98
shower tent, she beat me back into me to enter.

1290
01:16:39.98 --> 01:16:41.58
I was happy to oblige.

1291
01:16:41.58 --> 01:16:43.22
I felt human again.

1292
01:16:43.22 --> 01:16:44.86
This is after you get out of the shower.

1293
01:16:44.86 --> 01:16:45.86
I felt human again.

1294
01:16:45.86 --> 01:16:46.86
I smelled civilized.

1295
01:16:46.86 --> 01:16:48.78
I felt like a brand new man.

1296
01:16:48.78 --> 01:16:52.14
There was also going to be hot chalice served that night.

1297
01:16:52.14 --> 01:16:57.58
The first time that we'd received any since we left Booganville and I absolutely couldn't

1298
01:16:57.58 --> 01:17:00.78
wait.

1299
01:17:00.78 --> 01:17:06.78
So you get to LSA, Chestie and you kind of settle in and then this happens.

1300
01:17:06.78 --> 01:17:13.02
I was awoken by a serious hushed conversation just outside the STP, which is the shock trauma

1301
01:17:13.02 --> 01:17:17.02
platoon surgical tent door and I heard someone lifting up the camo netting to make her

1302
01:17:17.02 --> 01:17:18.86
way into our sleeping area.

1303
01:17:18.86 --> 01:17:22.82
Staff Sergeant Anderson, a whisper rang out among the sound of crickets and generators

1304
01:17:22.82 --> 01:17:24.94
not so far away.

1305
01:17:24.94 --> 01:17:29.42
After a short whisper discussion, staff Sergeant Anderson said, absolutely, man, we can

1306
01:17:29.42 --> 01:17:30.42
help.

1307
01:17:30.42 --> 01:17:32.02
Emma, get on your feet.

1308
01:17:32.02 --> 01:17:37.34
We heardly walked down into an open field to pre-stage ourselves in the darkness and in a

1309
01:17:37.34 --> 01:17:42.26
few minutes the unmistakable sound of an incoming helicopter grew louder.

1310
01:17:42.26 --> 01:17:47.30
Out of the dark, Iraqi night flickering lights were flipped on as a CH53 C-Stalian,

1311
01:17:47.30 --> 01:17:51.94
C-Stalian descended into a churning cloud of dusk.

1312
01:17:51.94 --> 01:17:55.94
With a lowering of the ramp, the crew chief signaled for us to advance.

1313
01:17:55.94 --> 01:18:02.46
We charged forward into the hot turbine exhaust and deafening noise into one huddled mass.

1314
01:18:02.46 --> 01:18:07.42
Taking the beating sand against our skin to quickly move up the tail ramp.

1315
01:18:07.42 --> 01:18:10.66
A green light illuminated the back of the helicopters we ran up.

1316
01:18:10.66 --> 01:18:15.70
The helicopter crew in the back pointed to several occupied litters that held the severely

1317
01:18:15.70 --> 01:18:20.86
wounded, clad and bloody bandages and it was a very sobering scene.

1318
01:18:20.86 --> 01:18:25.02
Each of us grabbed an end of the litter very carefully and carried them down the ramp and

1319
01:18:25.02 --> 01:18:29.10
away from the helo as their ponchos on top of them violently snapped back and forth against

1320
01:18:29.10 --> 01:18:31.14
the gusts of the still spinning blades.

1321
01:18:31.14 --> 01:18:37.26
We made our way up to the small incline toward the open tent door of the STP.

1322
01:18:37.26 --> 01:18:41.20
And inside of fluorescent world doctors were preparing their hands with red iodine

1323
01:18:41.20 --> 01:18:42.78
streets running down their arms.

1324
01:18:42.78 --> 01:18:47.06
I heard the marine who we were carrying mumble something and I couldn't make it out.

1325
01:18:47.06 --> 01:18:48.22
Stay strong marine.

1326
01:18:48.22 --> 01:18:49.66
We have U-D-S-T-P buddy.

1327
01:18:49.66 --> 01:18:51.66
You're going to be alright.

1328
01:18:51.66 --> 01:18:55.38
I gave him words of encouragement though I had no idea what his prognosis was but the

1329
01:18:55.38 --> 01:18:57.42
more I looked at his bloody bandages.

1330
01:18:57.42 --> 01:19:01.06
The more I was getting a sinking feeling in the pit of my belly that he might not survive

1331
01:19:01.06 --> 01:19:02.54
the night.

1332
01:19:02.54 --> 01:19:07.06
We crashed through the doorway and put our wounded guys onto the litter stands but the rear

1333
01:19:07.06 --> 01:19:11.18
doors were sealed and the only way to get out was the way we came in.

1334
01:19:11.18 --> 01:19:15.14
So we stood there trapped as the other wounded servicemen were still being carried in

1335
01:19:15.14 --> 01:19:19.90
and we got a small glints into the world of another kind of hero.

1336
01:19:19.90 --> 01:19:25.54
The nurses and doctors of the STP immediately assumed their duties and started to cut

1337
01:19:25.54 --> 01:19:30.42
the uniforms off the casualties and throw them into a bloody pile on the floor.

1338
01:19:30.42 --> 01:19:42.14
Start intervenes lines and start to speak loudly to the patients trying to get their attention.

1339
01:19:42.14 --> 01:19:47.74
And of those four that you brought in three of those did not survive and that was where

1340
01:19:47.74 --> 01:19:58.42
I started the podcast today was reading that excerpt of you and your team seeing dead American

1341
01:19:58.42 --> 01:20:05.62
servicemen for the first time.

1342
01:20:05.62 --> 01:20:13.18
And again, you know, this is just that opening of you seeing this for the first time and

1343
01:20:13.18 --> 01:20:18.26
you closed now by saying it was a tough night for the first time I'd ever seen to see servicemen

1344
01:20:18.26 --> 01:20:22.66
as much as I had prepared myself mentally and physically for the job I'd never prepared myself

1345
01:20:22.66 --> 01:20:24.14
emotionally.

1346
01:20:24.14 --> 01:20:27.50
I kept thinking about those guys.

1347
01:20:27.50 --> 01:20:35.74
The scenes kept playing over and over again in my head.

1348
01:20:35.74 --> 01:20:39.50
And that's 23 days into it and something like that.

1349
01:20:39.50 --> 01:20:44.10
So in all those fire fights, you'd seen a bunch of dead Iraqis on the way out there,

1350
01:20:44.10 --> 01:20:46.50
hundreds of them, maybe thousands of them.

1351
01:20:46.50 --> 01:20:49.22
I went that within thousands.

1352
01:20:49.22 --> 01:21:00.02
Maybe 100, 100 plus on the sides of the road, but not as thousands, but death.

1353
01:21:00.02 --> 01:21:01.82
When we passed first part, it started passing by.

1354
01:21:01.82 --> 01:21:04.14
I'm like, oh, look at that guy there.

1355
01:21:04.14 --> 01:21:07.50
Oh, look at this burning tank over here.

1356
01:21:07.50 --> 01:21:15.94
But when we got to finally the 23, 24 days when we had those three guys in there, it became

1357
01:21:15.94 --> 01:21:18.46
real.

1358
01:21:18.46 --> 01:21:25.38
Even though it was real, but this whole time you prepare yourself and you don't want

1359
01:21:25.38 --> 01:21:27.34
to do our job.

1360
01:21:27.34 --> 01:21:30.70
We never want to be the ones that were busy.

1361
01:21:30.70 --> 01:21:36.86
And then it was the first time that we had went through and had the face that realization

1362
01:21:36.86 --> 01:21:41.74
that we were needed.

1363
01:21:41.74 --> 01:21:47.50
And the guys that we were bringing in, you can connect to these people because they're

1364
01:21:47.50 --> 01:21:49.34
weren't the same uniform as you.

1365
01:21:49.34 --> 01:21:54.42
There's to have the same ones.

1366
01:21:54.42 --> 01:21:59.22
They want to go and do the best job they can and go home to their families.

1367
01:21:59.22 --> 01:22:07.74
And then all of a sudden what made me start to feel guilty is that I knew that they were dead.

1368
01:22:07.74 --> 01:22:11.90
I could see the pictures of their family members that they carried with them.

1369
01:22:11.90 --> 01:22:17.38
I see all that their family members don't know that this guy that was gone.

1370
01:22:17.38 --> 01:22:21.26
Especially when you see pictures of their children and it really kicks you square in the

1371
01:22:21.26 --> 01:22:23.26
teeth.

1372
01:22:23.26 --> 01:22:40.22
So, yeah, that night it just made us realize that we were in a job that was really important,

1373
01:22:40.22 --> 01:22:46.14
but you had to be tough in a totally different way, a way that we haven't prepared ourselves

1374
01:22:46.14 --> 01:22:48.74
before.

1375
01:22:48.74 --> 01:23:01.86
So, yeah, it's an interesting turn of events or the way that it washes out because that

1376
01:23:01.86 --> 01:23:07.78
happens and then pretty shortly thereafter you guys get told, oh yeah, that you're going

1377
01:23:07.78 --> 01:23:09.98
home.

1378
01:23:09.98 --> 01:23:11.06
So you covered that here.

1379
01:23:11.06 --> 01:23:15.58
We were notified that M182 was to rotate back to Kuwait because the other companies that

1380
01:23:15.58 --> 01:23:19.34
we trained back in Georgia and watching in DC in January needed to get some experience

1381
01:23:19.34 --> 01:23:22.34
before the war was to end.

1382
01:23:22.34 --> 01:23:24.06
And that left us a little raw.

1383
01:23:24.06 --> 01:23:28.74
We started this war four weeks prior watching the very first rounds impact by both air

1384
01:23:28.74 --> 01:23:29.90
and ground campaigns.

1385
01:23:29.90 --> 01:23:33.90
We transverse back and forth across this country supporting whichever unit was expecting

1386
01:23:33.90 --> 01:23:35.14
enemy contact.

1387
01:23:35.14 --> 01:23:40.58
And now we were being pulled out of the conflict before we could get across the goal line

1388
01:23:40.58 --> 01:23:43.14
in Baghdad.

1389
01:23:43.14 --> 01:23:47.70
And this is another just interesting perspective of war at the time.

1390
01:23:47.70 --> 01:23:53.18
Here's someone, you know, some senior person back there is going, you know what, this war is

1391
01:23:53.18 --> 01:23:54.18
going to be over pretty quick.

1392
01:23:54.18 --> 01:23:58.02
We better get some other people experience.

1393
01:23:58.02 --> 01:24:02.42
And by the way, this is April 13th, 2003.

1394
01:24:02.42 --> 01:24:10.34
This war had another decade, almost, I guess, and what is another seven years of fighting,

1395
01:24:10.34 --> 01:24:12.90
thousands of American casualties.

1396
01:24:12.90 --> 01:24:17.86
But that just shows you, you know, we looked at the first Gulf War.

1397
01:24:17.86 --> 01:24:22.66
It's over in 72 hours, you know, where the strongest military in the world.

1398
01:24:22.66 --> 01:24:24.34
We need to get some other people some experience.

1399
01:24:24.34 --> 01:24:25.78
These guys have had some cool.

1400
01:24:25.78 --> 01:24:28.02
We'll rotate them out.

1401
01:24:28.02 --> 01:24:36.30
You say, now we are climbing aboard a C130 on a one-way ticket out of combat.

1402
01:24:36.30 --> 01:24:40.78
And we felt as if, and I felt as if we had been cheated.

1403
01:24:40.78 --> 01:24:45.74
And then this aircraft that you get aboard for whatever reason, it takes you to Oman,

1404
01:24:45.74 --> 01:24:49.42
which is like the straight-up rear echelon.

1405
01:24:49.42 --> 01:24:50.42
Yeah.

1406
01:24:50.42 --> 01:24:55.82
And as you guys pull into this rear echelon command and get off, you say this, airman

1407
01:24:55.82 --> 01:24:57.62
who are lifting weights just stopped.

1408
01:24:57.62 --> 01:25:00.94
Females and t-shirts and shorts who are playing volleyball just stopped.

1409
01:25:00.94 --> 01:25:04.58
And people who looked as if they were heading somewhere in a hurry just stopped and whispered

1410
01:25:04.58 --> 01:25:06.90
among themselves as we passed.

1411
01:25:06.90 --> 01:25:10.58
I guess they were not used to seeing marine straight from the front lines in all our filthy

1412
01:25:10.58 --> 01:25:15.70
glory, even though we had taken showers just a couple days before our weird suntans from

1413
01:25:15.70 --> 01:25:20.34
wearing our helmets, our dirty, rack-coon faces, our sweat and fused camis, and four weeks

1414
01:25:20.34 --> 01:25:24.14
without fresh haircuts made us really stand out.

1415
01:25:24.14 --> 01:25:26.82
But to us, I guess they stood out too.

1416
01:25:26.82 --> 01:25:33.18
After four weeks of combat, where death was so common that had no longer passed in conversation.

1417
01:25:33.18 --> 01:25:38.34
We changed enough to know that the normal world would never be normal again.

1418
01:25:38.34 --> 01:25:41.14
It was as if this trip to Oman was a lucky windfall.

1419
01:25:41.14 --> 01:25:45.42
Are we had a rare opportunity to look through the looking glass of a magical mirror?

1420
01:25:45.42 --> 01:25:50.46
And in the reflection we could see ourselves when we were so innocent and naive, not so long

1421
01:25:50.46 --> 01:25:52.70
ago by days.

1422
01:25:52.70 --> 01:25:56.54
But forever ago, by our experiences.

1423
01:25:56.54 --> 01:25:59.78
Yeah, that's a serious contrast.

1424
01:25:59.78 --> 01:26:00.78
Yeah.

1425
01:26:00.78 --> 01:26:04.46
We were there at Camp Tresty.

1426
01:26:04.46 --> 01:26:08.70
The guy sitting at the white table, he was supposed to be the air, traffic controller,

1427
01:26:08.70 --> 01:26:10.50
said, that's the bird you need.

1428
01:26:10.50 --> 01:26:11.50
Here's your number.

1429
01:26:11.50 --> 01:26:12.50
Get on.

1430
01:26:12.50 --> 01:26:17.82
We got on, started taking off, it's supposed to be 45 minutes flight, about two hours

1431
01:26:17.82 --> 01:26:18.82
into it.

1432
01:26:18.82 --> 01:26:21.02
We were like, where are the hell are we going?

1433
01:26:21.02 --> 01:26:22.02
We weren't the only ones.

1434
01:26:22.02 --> 01:26:29.42
We had CBS News crew and a Navy Chief Master's, or Navy, you know.

1435
01:26:29.42 --> 01:26:30.94
So, yeah, E9.

1436
01:26:30.94 --> 01:26:34.42
So we got on there, spent about six or eight hours on the ground over there.

1437
01:26:34.42 --> 01:26:36.54
And this is another funny story.

1438
01:26:36.54 --> 01:26:41.46
So it's the first time I was able to call home, that called my dad.

1439
01:26:41.46 --> 01:26:44.30
So it was in a phone trailer.

1440
01:26:44.30 --> 01:26:49.46
I'm sitting back and I was like, Dad, man, this was so crazy out there that I saw this.

1441
01:26:49.46 --> 01:26:50.46
I saw that.

1442
01:26:50.46 --> 01:26:54.50
I was here when this happened and yeah, I watched the very first bombs happen and stuff.

1443
01:26:54.50 --> 01:26:59.38
And my dad was always glued to the TV, especially with anything was going on.

1444
01:26:59.38 --> 01:27:01.62
And I knew he was how you had it watching.

1445
01:27:01.62 --> 01:27:06.66
And so I'm telling all these stories and I sit back in the chair and stretch and I look

1446
01:27:06.66 --> 01:27:10.34
down in this, nobody was talking on their phones.

1447
01:27:10.34 --> 01:27:13.18
Everybody was glued to what I was saying.

1448
01:27:13.18 --> 01:27:18.34
So you had these 20 people watching me and they're like, oh my God, look at the, wow, that's

1449
01:27:18.34 --> 01:27:19.34
crazy.

1450
01:27:19.34 --> 01:27:26.14
But yeah, huge contrast between our services and their position, they're rolled as for us.

1451
01:27:26.14 --> 01:27:32.22
And you end up, you get back to co-ed eventually.

1452
01:27:32.22 --> 01:27:34.54
And then we finally left co-ed late May.

1453
01:27:34.54 --> 01:27:35.70
We returned home to our heroes.

1454
01:27:35.70 --> 01:27:37.90
Welcome back and date in Ohio and early June.

1455
01:27:37.90 --> 01:27:41.98
I returned to my job at the post office to find that my fellow carriers were excited to

1456
01:27:41.98 --> 01:27:46.82
shake my hand and welcome me back and I genuinely felt appreciated.

1457
01:27:46.82 --> 01:27:48.46
That's it.

1458
01:27:48.46 --> 01:27:55.30
As my buddy, Johnny once said when we were in my first deployment, he goes, dude, you will

1459
01:27:55.30 --> 01:27:56.30
get ready to go home.

1460
01:27:56.30 --> 01:28:00.78
He said, dude, you know tomorrow we're going to get on an aluminum tube and we're going

1461
01:28:00.78 --> 01:28:05.30
to wake up and be back and send ya go dude.

1462
01:28:05.30 --> 01:28:07.66
That's awesome.

1463
01:28:07.66 --> 01:28:16.74
We say November and again, jumping ahead a little bit in November, the unit called looking

1464
01:28:16.74 --> 01:28:20.70
for any non-military police volunteers to help fill holes on the roster for the military

1465
01:28:20.70 --> 01:28:22.18
police deployment.

1466
01:28:22.18 --> 01:28:25.74
We're going to put all of us M.A. Marines quickly volunteers since we were pretty much

1467
01:28:25.74 --> 01:28:30.62
non-school trained MPs anyways.

1468
01:28:30.62 --> 01:28:36.74
And again, they say, well, no, maybe we don't need you and then you course volunteer again

1469
01:28:36.74 --> 01:28:42.26
and then finally you get, they say, we're going to take you.

1470
01:28:42.26 --> 01:28:43.26
Yeah.

1471
01:28:43.26 --> 01:28:46.26
We're going to take you for a MTT.

1472
01:28:46.26 --> 01:28:47.26
Military training.

1473
01:28:47.26 --> 01:28:48.26
Mobile training team.

1474
01:28:48.26 --> 01:28:56.86
Our role was supposed to be to impart Western style policing to the Iraqi police who

1475
01:28:56.86 --> 01:29:00.58
were rumored not to do too much beyond sitting there and collecting the bribes, drinking

1476
01:29:00.58 --> 01:29:02.58
tea, accurate service.

1477
01:29:02.58 --> 01:29:03.58
Yep.

1478
01:29:03.58 --> 01:29:07.66
So, well, and let's just say also, if you weren't there, Iraqi police, there was also a decent

1479
01:29:07.66 --> 01:29:09.86
chance that you were going to get murdered and your whole family was too.

1480
01:29:09.86 --> 01:29:14.46
So it wasn't the only people that were doing it were, well, it was a hard job in that

1481
01:29:14.46 --> 01:29:19.46
perspective and then there wasn't a lot of positive reasons to go out on patrol.

1482
01:29:19.46 --> 01:29:22.86
That's the other thing is don't think of Iraqi police as a crime stopper.

1483
01:29:22.86 --> 01:29:27.22
These guys were supposed to fight the insurgency inside their own country.

1484
01:29:27.22 --> 01:29:33.94
So it's what we needed to do is build their security in their country and one of the

1485
01:29:33.94 --> 01:29:36.94
ways to do that was by strengthening the Iraqi police.

1486
01:29:36.94 --> 01:29:42.10
So you were doing these mobile training teams to get these guys up to speed, but it was

1487
01:29:42.10 --> 01:29:43.10
a tough job.

1488
01:29:43.10 --> 01:29:44.10
Right.

1489
01:29:44.10 --> 01:29:48.34
Um, yeah, but you get to call to go and then ever since I got the phone call on Monday,

1490
01:29:48.34 --> 01:29:50.58
I had a really bad feeling about this whole deployment.

1491
01:29:50.58 --> 01:29:51.78
Something just wasn't right.

1492
01:29:51.78 --> 01:29:57.90
I couldn't tell what it was.

1493
01:29:57.90 --> 01:30:04.34
And then March 1, 2004, the 19-day shy of a year since I first crossed into the breach.

1494
01:30:04.34 --> 01:30:08.74
In the many months of my absence, the constant conflict could change these highways into vast

1495
01:30:08.74 --> 01:30:14.14
expanses of nervous tension and the balance of favor into the hands of the lawless.

1496
01:30:14.14 --> 01:30:18.82
So again, Americans, most Americans myself included.

1497
01:30:18.82 --> 01:30:22.10
We thought the war is going to be over quick and now all of a sudden we're year into it.

1498
01:30:22.10 --> 01:30:24.02
And it's not getting better.

1499
01:30:24.02 --> 01:30:25.66
It's starting to get worse.

1500
01:30:25.66 --> 01:30:27.22
When is this in May of 2004?

1501
01:30:27.22 --> 01:30:28.22
March of 2004?

1502
01:30:28.22 --> 01:30:29.22
Yeah.

1503
01:30:29.22 --> 01:30:30.22
Yeah.

1504
01:30:30.22 --> 01:30:37.26
So I was in Baghdad when you were going, um, and you were heading up to Hadeetha.

1505
01:30:37.26 --> 01:30:38.26
Yeah.

1506
01:30:38.26 --> 01:30:39.26
I'm not a fact.

1507
01:30:39.26 --> 01:30:41.50
I might have done an opt to up in Hadeetha.

1508
01:30:41.50 --> 01:30:43.78
It was a nasty telling man.

1509
01:30:43.78 --> 01:30:44.78
Yeah.

1510
01:30:44.78 --> 01:30:46.26
We came up to Hadeetha one time.

1511
01:30:46.26 --> 01:30:50.14
We drove up there from Baghdad and did an opt.

1512
01:30:50.14 --> 01:30:53.78
And I'm trying to think of when it was, if you guys were there or not.

1513
01:30:53.78 --> 01:31:00.94
But regardless, as you guys are driving up there, it's, uh, the same roads that last year

1514
01:31:00.94 --> 01:31:06.74
were chock full of smiling and waving civilians were now filled with IED Blast Craters

1515
01:31:06.74 --> 01:31:09.02
and splintered shrapnel.

1516
01:31:09.02 --> 01:31:16.50
Gunny Sergeant Ballantine, Corporal Friceler, Friceler, Friceler, Lance Corporal,

1517
01:31:16.50 --> 01:31:22.58
Measure Sack, Measure, um, his name is, uh, Major Sack.

1518
01:31:22.58 --> 01:31:23.58
Major Sack.

1519
01:31:23.58 --> 01:31:24.58
Yeah.

1520
01:31:24.58 --> 01:31:25.58
It's, it's built like Major Kack.

1521
01:31:25.58 --> 01:31:26.58
But it's, Major Sack.

1522
01:31:26.58 --> 01:31:29.30
I'm going to give these guys Nick names for me.

1523
01:31:29.30 --> 01:31:30.46
Sergeant Uppem.

1524
01:31:30.46 --> 01:31:31.46
Yeah.

1525
01:31:31.46 --> 01:31:35.02
And I were designated to be military police mobile training team.

1526
01:31:35.02 --> 01:31:36.66
Now what's weird about this is this is, this is,

1527
01:31:36.66 --> 01:31:39.42
uh, zero to do with MA, to do zero.

1528
01:31:39.42 --> 01:31:40.70
You're with mortuary affairs.

1529
01:31:40.70 --> 01:31:44.10
You're going on a combat deployment now, right?

1530
01:31:44.10 --> 01:31:48.98
To be, and by the way, when you do these mobile training teams, you're not just training

1531
01:31:48.98 --> 01:31:49.98
them.

1532
01:31:49.98 --> 01:31:50.98
What you have to do is you have to go on patrol.

1533
01:31:50.98 --> 01:31:53.26
You have to show them how it's done.

1534
01:31:53.26 --> 01:31:56.62
This is a dangerous, dangerous job.

1535
01:31:56.62 --> 01:31:58.26
Uh, continue on.

1536
01:31:58.26 --> 01:32:01.78
I was going to take us three days to drive up from the Udari range and Kuwait to the

1537
01:32:01.78 --> 01:32:02.78
Ditha Dam.

1538
01:32:02.78 --> 01:32:05.78
You drove that, yep.

1539
01:32:05.78 --> 01:32:06.78
What's the case in West?

1540
01:32:06.78 --> 01:32:07.78
Where'd you stop?

1541
01:32:07.78 --> 01:32:08.78
Did you stop?

1542
01:32:08.78 --> 01:32:09.78
I stopped in Baghdad.

1543
01:32:09.78 --> 01:32:10.78
That was our first stop.

1544
01:32:10.78 --> 01:32:16.74
And that was like a little, uh, uh, a, uh, a refueling place with huge gigantic concrete barriers.

1545
01:32:16.74 --> 01:32:22.42
There are probably four or five stories tall and a really small area.

1546
01:32:22.42 --> 01:32:27.02
And we stayed the night there and, uh, different story.

1547
01:32:27.02 --> 01:32:33.26
But I met a, a corporal who was with a, um, with a, with a, with a, uh, L.A.V.

1548
01:32:33.26 --> 01:32:35.74
And it was like, man, I've never seen these things up close.

1549
01:32:35.74 --> 01:32:38.02
I want to check it out and stuff.

1550
01:32:38.02 --> 01:32:44.06
I got called to go to a meeting and later on, um, you know, he was already racked out.

1551
01:32:44.06 --> 01:32:46.26
So I missed my opportunity.

1552
01:32:46.26 --> 01:32:51.70
But if, if, if it turns out that, uh, I found out later on just recently that he passed

1553
01:32:51.70 --> 01:32:54.82
away, uh, within a lot of a month or two.

1554
01:32:54.82 --> 01:33:00.18
And in, in one of my, uh, talks that I gave my book presentation down in Kentucky, his wife

1555
01:33:00.18 --> 01:33:01.18
was there.

1556
01:33:01.18 --> 01:33:08.10
So, show me a picture and I didn't have the heart to tell her that I, I met him.

1557
01:33:08.10 --> 01:33:09.10
There at that.

1558
01:33:09.10 --> 01:33:12.26
But we stayed there at that refueling area.

1559
01:33:12.26 --> 01:33:17.14
And then we drove all the way out to Alessad, spitting night at Alessad.

1560
01:33:17.14 --> 01:33:19.78
And then from there, we went out to the vehicles that you have with her.

1561
01:33:19.78 --> 01:33:20.78
Wow.

1562
01:33:20.78 --> 01:33:21.78
I can't even tell.

1563
01:33:21.78 --> 01:33:22.78
So it was a problem.

1564
01:33:22.78 --> 01:33:23.78
It was a bunch.

1565
01:33:23.78 --> 01:33:26.26
I was with third of a time, fourth Marines, weapons company.

1566
01:33:26.26 --> 01:33:27.26
God.

1567
01:33:27.26 --> 01:33:28.26
So we were all moving in.

1568
01:33:28.26 --> 01:33:32.54
We were out at, and we were taking over for the third ACR for the Army.

1569
01:33:32.54 --> 01:33:37.34
You go here from overpassed overpassed and everything in between my 240 Gulf Sponon circles.

1570
01:33:37.34 --> 01:33:41.38
My anxiety was thick trying to anticipate the enemies move before it happened.

1571
01:33:41.38 --> 01:33:47.78
I don't know what the, well, the, the, the fact was the enemy would use bridges to like

1572
01:33:47.78 --> 01:33:49.74
set up IEDs to ambush you.

1573
01:33:49.74 --> 01:33:55.30
And so every bridge was like a, like a threat.

1574
01:33:55.30 --> 01:33:59.74
And actually I just talked about Johnny talking about the aluminum tube.

1575
01:33:59.74 --> 01:34:00.90
Well that was another thing.

1576
01:34:00.90 --> 01:34:03.14
Every time because he would ride my vehicle.

1577
01:34:03.14 --> 01:34:05.90
And every time we'd, we'd coming up to a bridge.

1578
01:34:05.90 --> 01:34:09.10
Jolly be in the back going, here it comes.

1579
01:34:09.10 --> 01:34:11.38
Shocker, you ready for your cons, bro.

1580
01:34:11.38 --> 01:34:12.38
This is it.

1581
01:34:12.38 --> 01:34:16.26
And he could make this weird noise like with his mouth like a loud, clicking noise.

1582
01:34:16.26 --> 01:34:18.62
Like, but it was really loud.

1583
01:34:18.62 --> 01:34:22.90
And if you got to be loud to you to be able to hear it in Humvee and with one headphone

1584
01:34:22.90 --> 01:34:26.70
on some listen to radio, got a radio going and he'd be, you know, and then we'd get through

1585
01:34:26.70 --> 01:34:28.78
it and he'd go, got lucky on that one.

1586
01:34:28.78 --> 01:34:32.82
And then you know, four minutes later you're going under another bridge and Johnny's going,

1587
01:34:32.82 --> 01:34:34.54
oh, this one doesn't look good, bro.

1588
01:34:34.54 --> 01:34:37.46
And Jolly, you ready to get some, here it comes, bro.

1589
01:34:37.46 --> 01:34:41.26
And then, and we drive through.

1590
01:34:41.26 --> 01:34:47.82
So because they use it, man, the bridge going under bridges gave you a definite, yes, a definite

1591
01:34:47.82 --> 01:34:48.82
special.

1592
01:34:48.82 --> 01:34:51.38
And you guys have armored, um, bridges, our armored homies?

1593
01:34:51.38 --> 01:34:52.38
We did not.

1594
01:34:52.38 --> 01:34:57.56
I mean, everybody else, when they, basically, the data that we were all stacked up

1595
01:34:57.56 --> 01:35:03.02
ready to go, they just came over with a palette and said, have that.

1596
01:35:03.02 --> 01:35:07.06
And they, all these guys sort of grabbing everything, bolting them onto their weapons, on

1597
01:35:07.06 --> 01:35:08.54
my own to their vehicles.

1598
01:35:08.54 --> 01:35:11.26
And I was just cleaning my weapon and then they were like, hey, we've got a couple of pieces

1599
01:35:11.26 --> 01:35:12.26
left over here.

1600
01:35:12.26 --> 01:35:13.26
You want it?

1601
01:35:13.26 --> 01:35:14.26
Mine is well not even taken.

1602
01:35:14.26 --> 01:35:16.90
It's just like a, maybe a half a door or something.

1603
01:35:16.90 --> 01:35:21.78
So basically we just sat there on armored vehicle and I was on the upgun.

1604
01:35:21.78 --> 01:35:24.38
I was on the 240, almost the entire trip.

1605
01:35:24.38 --> 01:35:27.58
I'd tell you, going under those bridges, I was always looking up.

1606
01:35:27.58 --> 01:35:32.22
I was expecting to see a 90s sitting right there to blow down.

1607
01:35:32.22 --> 01:35:37.06
And when you people got people up top or cars parked off in the distance somewhere, oh, man,

1608
01:35:37.06 --> 01:35:38.74
bad feeling, bad feeling.

1609
01:35:38.74 --> 01:35:40.06
Just sat there and just gritted teeth.

1610
01:35:40.06 --> 01:35:44.10
Yeah, hopefully you just, hopefully you don't, they're not accurate.

1611
01:35:44.10 --> 01:35:45.10
Yeah.

1612
01:35:45.10 --> 01:35:46.10
Yeah.

1613
01:35:46.10 --> 01:35:47.10
We're gonna strap on the day or night.

1614
01:35:47.10 --> 01:35:48.10
Ah, day.

1615
01:35:48.10 --> 01:35:51.60
See, we, during that first one, we'd only travel, we'll

1616
01:35:51.60 --> 01:35:53.52
pretty much as much as we could travel at night.

1617
01:35:53.52 --> 01:35:55.96
We travel super fast, totally blacked out on knots.

1618
01:35:55.96 --> 01:35:59.44
So when we got ambushed a couple times, it would they always catch the tail end of

1619
01:35:59.44 --> 01:36:03.40
us because it wouldn't be effective because we would be through it.

1620
01:36:03.40 --> 01:36:04.64
Yeah, you know.

1621
01:36:04.64 --> 01:36:08.16
But having that many vehicles during the daytime.

1622
01:36:08.16 --> 01:36:09.16
Yeah.

1623
01:36:09.16 --> 01:36:10.84
We actually broke down in Felicia.

1624
01:36:10.84 --> 01:36:11.84
Oh, that's fun.

1625
01:36:11.84 --> 01:36:13.84
Right there on the highway, no shit, man.

1626
01:36:13.84 --> 01:36:16.68
Because I'd ever heard of Adiza.

1627
01:36:16.68 --> 01:36:19.08
No, we were down in Kuwait.

1628
01:36:19.08 --> 01:36:21.64
And there were everybody was talking about Felicia.

1629
01:36:21.64 --> 01:36:22.88
They had Felicia's the nasty town man.

1630
01:36:22.88 --> 01:36:25.88
You know, that's the where the big ball games at, you know.

1631
01:36:25.88 --> 01:36:28.64
So I only knew back then, Felicia.

1632
01:36:28.64 --> 01:36:30.12
So we finally get there in Felicia.

1633
01:36:30.12 --> 01:36:34.32
On there, right there on the highway and one in the Humvees, bring it on.

1634
01:36:34.32 --> 01:36:37.72
And I'm on the upgun and we punch out of security.

1635
01:36:37.72 --> 01:36:41.92
I got the radio up in my chin strap and I'm circling right, I'm seeing people run around

1636
01:36:41.92 --> 01:36:44.08
us on the building setting up on us.

1637
01:36:44.08 --> 01:36:46.52
And I'm calling it up.

1638
01:36:46.52 --> 01:36:47.52
And I'm calling it up.

1639
01:36:47.52 --> 01:36:50.12
Like sit, rip over, sit, rip over.

1640
01:36:50.12 --> 01:36:51.96
You know, nobody's saying anything.

1641
01:36:51.96 --> 01:36:54.48
I'm like, what's going on?

1642
01:36:54.48 --> 01:37:02.64
And we finally, after seeing like forever and the lieutenant gets on, it goes, it's okay.

1643
01:37:02.64 --> 01:37:06.16
When we punched out our security, before we hooked up to tow bars, somebody punched

1644
01:37:06.16 --> 01:37:09.56
in, tripped over a wire, he reached over and cut it.

1645
01:37:09.56 --> 01:37:13.36
And it was an IED that was five feet from his damn door.

1646
01:37:13.36 --> 01:37:14.36
Yeah.

1647
01:37:14.36 --> 01:37:17.04
That was very, very, very lucky.

1648
01:37:17.04 --> 01:37:22.40
But we hooked up two bars and we were finally got back on the road and scary situation,

1649
01:37:22.40 --> 01:37:30.40
but narrowly, itverted because nobody at that time, every convoy was getting hit.

1650
01:37:30.40 --> 01:37:35.56
And we were one of the very few that didn't get hit.

1651
01:37:35.56 --> 01:37:38.56
We were expecting death and destruction on that.

1652
01:37:38.56 --> 01:37:45.04
First of all, freaking, road warrior shit.

1653
01:37:45.04 --> 01:37:48.48
We say here that geography of the Western province of Alambar was very different from the

1654
01:37:48.48 --> 01:37:52.12
scenery that I had already known in Iraq for my last trip.

1655
01:37:52.12 --> 01:37:56.76
No longer we see the vast flat emptiness of the sand seas that held sporadic, a tolls

1656
01:37:56.76 --> 01:37:59.20
of green life and small-engine communities.

1657
01:37:59.20 --> 01:38:04.08
Here we're rolling hills that contain the bustling population centers of Flusia, Habaniah

1658
01:38:04.08 --> 01:38:05.92
hit and Al Ramadi.

1659
01:38:05.92 --> 01:38:08.76
All extremely dangerous cities in the spring of 2004.

1660
01:38:08.76 --> 01:38:12.52
Intelligence reports indicated that al Qaeda fighters were being funneled in through the

1661
01:38:12.52 --> 01:38:19.84
Syrian border town of Al Qaeda and followed down the ancient spice trade routes now paved

1662
01:38:19.84 --> 01:38:25.72
into a highway that US forces designated as MSR Michigan.

1663
01:38:25.72 --> 01:38:29.48
Kidnapping's executions, assassinations and torture were commonplace in the back alleyways

1664
01:38:29.48 --> 01:38:33.84
of most any towns along the route resembling the layers of an onion.

1665
01:38:33.84 --> 01:38:37.08
It was several wars in case when the larger conflict.

1666
01:38:37.08 --> 01:38:42.000
We now found ourselves struggling to keep the peace and order among sworn enemies from

1667
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.96
factions that held no loyalties but to themselves.

1668
01:38:44.96 --> 01:38:50.04
There only common enemy was us which they fervently attacked whenever given the appropriate

1669
01:38:50.04 --> 01:38:52.32
opportunity.

1670
01:38:52.32 --> 01:38:54.52
So this is, yeah, this is Alambar.

1671
01:38:54.52 --> 01:38:59.12
Yeah, lovely Alambar problems.

1672
01:38:59.12 --> 01:39:00.12
You finally get up there.

1673
01:39:00.12 --> 01:39:03.40
We had driven to the base of the dam and I was taken aback by the enormity of this

1674
01:39:03.40 --> 01:39:04.40
mega structure.

1675
01:39:04.40 --> 01:39:07.68
Yeah, that dam is freaking huge.

1676
01:39:07.68 --> 01:39:10.08
It looks like something other James Bond flick.

1677
01:39:10.08 --> 01:39:11.08
Yeah.

1678
01:39:11.08 --> 01:39:12.08
It's crazy.

1679
01:39:12.08 --> 01:39:13.08
It's awesome.

1680
01:39:13.08 --> 01:39:17.48
It looks like you could imagine there's a rocket in there or something, you know, some

1681
01:39:17.48 --> 01:39:18.48
evil guy carrying a ball.

1682
01:39:18.48 --> 01:39:20.48
You know, you little cat.

1683
01:39:20.48 --> 01:39:21.48
It's a...

1684
01:39:21.48 --> 01:39:22.48
Mesh drum beckles where.

1685
01:39:22.48 --> 01:39:26.24
You know what I'm looking at?

1686
01:39:26.24 --> 01:39:27.48
You go for a little bit here.

1687
01:39:27.48 --> 01:39:31.68
I took in this rounding landscape and joined a cool light wind and looked at the two towns

1688
01:39:31.68 --> 01:39:34.04
of dam village and Hadith in the distance.

1689
01:39:34.04 --> 01:39:37.64
That was where the enemy was hiding and that was where he felt comfortable.

1690
01:39:37.64 --> 01:39:41.64
Because we had control over the dam and the dam was such a prominent structure and you're

1691
01:39:41.64 --> 01:39:43.04
looking down at everything.

1692
01:39:43.04 --> 01:39:44.64
It's got a great high visibility.

1693
01:39:44.64 --> 01:39:52.04
Fast forward a little bit.

1694
01:39:52.04 --> 01:39:56.16
A high pitch whistling sound coming from the outside caught my attention.

1695
01:39:56.16 --> 01:39:57.16
What's that I asked myself?

1696
01:39:57.16 --> 01:40:00.68
Get inside, get inside, scream the weapons company marines that I had just hung out

1697
01:40:00.68 --> 01:40:01.68
with on the patio.

1698
01:40:01.68 --> 01:40:05.000
Twenty guys piled on top of one of their pushing each other to get out of the way through

1699
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
a double set of doors.

1700
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.20
Caboon, caboon, splash, splash.

1701
01:40:11.20 --> 01:40:14.68
The lights flickered, dust shook off the ceiling and the concussion resonated within

1702
01:40:14.68 --> 01:40:19.04
my chest and we more to rounds fell out of the sky and impacted the compound area, some

1703
01:40:19.04 --> 01:40:21.64
being overshot and impacting the lake behind us.

1704
01:40:21.64 --> 01:40:26.24
We were inside the biggest bunker on this side of Iraq so I felt safe hanging outside

1705
01:40:26.24 --> 01:40:27.24
my room.

1706
01:40:27.24 --> 01:40:30.000
Naturally our attention was focused on all those marines that ran in.

1707
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Is everybody okay?

1708
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Someone asked.

1709
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.16
The consensus was equal across the board.

1710
01:40:34.16 --> 01:40:37.24
No one was hurt.

1711
01:40:37.24 --> 01:40:40.28
It took just a few minutes until the ward was spread that we were going to get up in a few

1712
01:40:40.28 --> 01:40:43.16
hours earlier than what we expected in the morning.

1713
01:40:43.16 --> 01:40:48.32
The bad guys just sent the challenge of red rover, red rover send the marines over.

1714
01:40:48.32 --> 01:40:53.12
We are going out in force before first light and the marines of weapons company, third

1715
01:40:53.12 --> 01:40:57.16
battalion, fourth marines were chomping at the bit to answer the call and I was happy

1716
01:40:57.16 --> 01:40:59.52
to go out with them.

1717
01:40:59.52 --> 01:41:01.52
So you're going out on your first patrol.

1718
01:41:01.52 --> 01:41:05.92
How many days have you been at the dam before your first patrol was it just like a couple

1719
01:41:05.92 --> 01:41:06.92
days?

1720
01:41:06.92 --> 01:41:10.08
I was just a couple days.

1721
01:41:10.08 --> 01:41:13.52
They're with a pit of curtable coy.

1722
01:41:13.52 --> 01:41:16.92
He had a very aggressive policy.

1723
01:41:16.92 --> 01:41:23.40
You know, he wanted to make everybody know in the area that we were in town so that we

1724
01:41:23.40 --> 01:41:24.56
were doing that.

1725
01:41:24.56 --> 01:41:25.56
Here we come.

1726
01:41:25.56 --> 01:41:29.000
First patrol with a hand signal our darkened figures emerged from the mist like ghosts

1727
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.32
upon the land to move as one, changing the pattern of the formation to have every weapon

1728
01:41:33.32 --> 01:41:38.76
barrel cover every angle around us, trust in no one or no thing outside this circle of

1729
01:41:38.76 --> 01:41:39.76
men.

1730
01:41:39.76 --> 01:41:43.72
Question every step, every loose piece of trash, every bump in the sand or anything

1731
01:41:43.72 --> 01:41:45.28
that looked like it didn't belong.

1732
01:41:45.28 --> 01:41:48.84
We were heading directly in the harm's way and every inch of our trek could be paved

1733
01:41:48.84 --> 01:41:50.28
with bad intentions.

1734
01:41:50.28 --> 01:41:55.54
IEDs could take any shape and be left out here, waiting patiently to take life for

1735
01:41:55.54 --> 01:41:56.54
limb.

1736
01:41:56.54 --> 01:42:05.86
That was, you guys, you guys do your first patrol and again, by the book because you give

1737
01:42:05.86 --> 01:42:11.42
really good detail, you explain what it feels like in a way that I was reading it going

1738
01:42:11.42 --> 01:42:12.42
up.

1739
01:42:12.42 --> 01:42:14.78
Yep, that's it right there.

1740
01:42:14.78 --> 01:42:16.26
So you do a great job with that.

1741
01:42:16.26 --> 01:42:23.82
I'm going to fast forward a little bit and I think this is your next patrol.

1742
01:42:23.82 --> 01:42:26.90
Lieutenant Dancerraise Desarm as to signal a patrol to advance forward.

1743
01:42:26.90 --> 01:42:28.70
It was time to step off and do this thing.

1744
01:42:28.70 --> 01:42:33.18
I clip my radio handset into the train strap on my helmet so I could free both hands and

1745
01:42:33.18 --> 01:42:37.14
still monitor the radio tucked the antenna strut into the straps that lined the front of

1746
01:42:37.14 --> 01:42:41.82
my flat vest to keep my radio low profile.

1747
01:42:41.82 --> 01:42:46.54
Stuck the butt of my rifle into my pocket of my shoulder and put my game face on because

1748
01:42:46.54 --> 01:42:50.02
it was time to do work.

1749
01:42:50.02 --> 01:42:54.06
Like the gears of a finely tuned machine, each command was quickly followed by precise movements,

1750
01:42:54.06 --> 01:42:58.78
all the while each individual expertly adjusted his own tactics to fit his own threats.

1751
01:42:58.78 --> 01:43:02.74
If a window or street corner posed as to endanger the team, it was quickly recognized,

1752
01:43:02.74 --> 01:43:06.10
communicated and then covered by one or more rifle barrels.

1753
01:43:06.10 --> 01:43:10.24
Three-four had a proud history from the earliest days of the Pacific Campaign in World

1754
01:43:10.24 --> 01:43:17.98
War II throughout the Vietnam War and to the fall of Baghdad almost one year ago.

1755
01:43:17.98 --> 01:43:22.90
When you talk about the tent of McCoy, three-four strive to be the hardest infantry battalion

1756
01:43:22.90 --> 01:43:23.90
in the Marine Corps.

1757
01:43:23.90 --> 01:43:25.54
It's just no easy feat.

1758
01:43:25.54 --> 01:43:32.38
You guys are continuing on this patrol.

1759
01:43:32.38 --> 01:43:36.90
There was a small gray car that turned down our street and started to drive toward us.

1760
01:43:36.90 --> 01:43:41.50
No one attempted to stop it and have it turn around away from our formation to just keep

1761
01:43:41.50 --> 01:43:47.14
coming closer and closer until it broke the integrity of our patrol, what the fuck?

1762
01:43:47.14 --> 01:43:48.98
One of this was a car bump.

1763
01:43:48.98 --> 01:43:53.02
It would most definitely wipe out most of us, I said to myself, the car drove down to the

1764
01:43:53.02 --> 01:43:57.70
road until it was close enough for me to touch literally.

1765
01:43:57.70 --> 01:44:02.82
The man had a gray and purple long sleeve shirt that had stripes that went across the arm

1766
01:44:02.82 --> 01:44:04.74
similar to a rugby shirt.

1767
01:44:04.74 --> 01:44:10.06
I looked quickly inside to see if I could spot any weapons and waived it with my left hand.

1768
01:44:10.06 --> 01:44:13.82
He waived it me with his left, never turning his head to look at me.

1769
01:44:13.82 --> 01:44:21.34
I turned to step away and he extended his first finger to touch the dashboard.

1770
01:44:21.34 --> 01:44:23.54
Kaboom.

1771
01:44:23.54 --> 01:44:27.54
Within a fraction of a nanosecond, I felt a sudden and massive overpressure that made my

1772
01:44:27.54 --> 01:44:29.98
eyeballs want to pop inside the sockets.

1773
01:44:29.98 --> 01:44:34.94
The air in my lungs sucked out and a torn of dirt rushed past my head and then blackness.

1774
01:44:34.94 --> 01:44:39.34
I never heard a blast, I just felt it.

1775
01:44:39.34 --> 01:44:40.50
What the?

1776
01:44:40.50 --> 01:44:41.50
I lay there.

1777
01:44:41.50 --> 01:44:43.26
My body numb and tingling.

1778
01:44:43.26 --> 01:44:45.54
I slow to accept my senses and cognition.

1779
01:44:45.54 --> 01:44:51.14
I open my eyes and at first the light seemed to hurt and then the focus waved in.

1780
01:44:51.14 --> 01:44:55.58
Through the high pitched whining in my ears, indecisurable shouts were coming from my left

1781
01:44:55.58 --> 01:45:00.30
behind me that I noticed a taste in my mouth of blood and I had a burning inside my chest

1782
01:45:00.30 --> 01:45:05.30
as if I'd been the quarterback with a shitty offensive line and had the ever loving shit

1783
01:45:05.30 --> 01:45:06.70
stopped out of me.

1784
01:45:06.70 --> 01:45:11.66
So, I was so sloggically, my head started to release from the days to fog and my thoughts were starting

1785
01:45:11.66 --> 01:45:14.78
to once again form and regain clarity.

1786
01:45:14.78 --> 01:45:19.26
I looked around and noticed that I wasn't where I was just a second before, where the

1787
01:45:19.26 --> 01:45:21.78
hell am I asked?

1788
01:45:21.78 --> 01:45:26.54
I'd found myself face down at a ditch, a dozen yards away from the road and my heavy pack

1789
01:45:26.54 --> 01:45:30.46
which contained the radio and extra gear had slid up my back, now rested on the base

1790
01:45:30.46 --> 01:45:32.58
of my head driving my skull into the mud.

1791
01:45:32.58 --> 01:45:33.98
What the fuck happened?

1792
01:45:33.98 --> 01:45:35.38
What was that explosion?

1793
01:45:35.38 --> 01:45:36.74
Did the car blow up?

1794
01:45:36.74 --> 01:45:37.74
Why am I not dead?

1795
01:45:37.74 --> 01:45:39.46
Or am I?

1796
01:45:39.46 --> 01:45:44.06
I spit out the dirt my mouth and looked up to my right and saw that I was at the bottom of a hill

1797
01:45:44.06 --> 01:45:48.66
at the top of the hill was an outdoor goat market with a bunch of merchants who were

1798
01:45:48.66 --> 01:45:52.78
grabbing goats and throwing them into their cars to get out of the ensuing crossfire.

1799
01:45:52.78 --> 01:45:55.14
Oh shit, where the fuck is my rifle?

1800
01:45:55.14 --> 01:45:58.58
Marines have been taught from the very first days of boot camp that you never lose your

1801
01:45:58.58 --> 01:46:01.22
fucking weapon ever.

1802
01:46:01.22 --> 01:46:07.02
For a second I acted like that awkward first battalion recruit on Paris Island that I was

1803
01:46:07.02 --> 01:46:09.38
even 11 years before.

1804
01:46:09.38 --> 01:46:11.18
I almost shit myself and panic.

1805
01:46:11.18 --> 01:46:12.78
Okay there it is, thank God.

1806
01:46:12.78 --> 01:46:16.82
Then like a flash of lightning, the sun realization hit me and fear gripped my heart.

1807
01:46:16.82 --> 01:46:20.18
I was at the bottom of the ditch with no place to hide and no cover.

1808
01:46:20.18 --> 01:46:22.86
They were going to start shooting any second.

1809
01:46:22.86 --> 01:46:26.42
If I wanted to live, I had to get out of here and I needed to get out of here fast.

1810
01:46:26.42 --> 01:46:30.34
I started to crawl up the hill toward the elevated road, bearing my feet into the loose

1811
01:46:30.34 --> 01:46:31.82
dirt to gain traction.

1812
01:46:31.82 --> 01:46:36.02
It seemed like the harder I tried to call out, the further I slid back into my hole.

1813
01:46:36.02 --> 01:46:40.50
My muscles ate, my lungs still burned and I was already exhausted before the fight had

1814
01:46:40.50 --> 01:46:41.50
even begun.

1815
01:46:41.50 --> 01:46:44.86
Suck it the fuck up Chris, suck it up and push on, get out.

1816
01:46:44.86 --> 01:46:46.86
I had to stay low, I wanted to stay low.

1817
01:46:46.86 --> 01:46:50.30
If they were going to start shooting, I needed to not be a target.

1818
01:46:50.30 --> 01:46:54.58
I crawled up to the crest and found that there was no other place to hide up here either.

1819
01:46:54.58 --> 01:46:57.82
But I rejoid my fellow Marines in that game he comfort.

1820
01:46:57.82 --> 01:47:02.10
I totally expected to see the burning wreckage of an exploded car, but when I surfaced

1821
01:47:02.10 --> 01:47:03.58
out of the ditch, there was none.

1822
01:47:03.58 --> 01:47:05.70
It must have blown up and threw itself off the road.

1823
01:47:05.70 --> 01:47:08.14
I said to myself, it was pure chaos.

1824
01:47:08.14 --> 01:47:11.78
Marines were running around trying to regain control of the situation and the civilians

1825
01:47:11.78 --> 01:47:13.90
were desperately trying to get out of the way.

1826
01:47:13.90 --> 01:47:14.90
Where the fuck is it?

1827
01:47:14.90 --> 01:47:15.90
Where the fuck is it?

1828
01:47:15.90 --> 01:47:17.58
I screamed while prone on the side of the road.

1829
01:47:17.58 --> 01:47:18.58
Where is what?

1830
01:47:18.58 --> 01:47:19.58
Someone yelled back.

1831
01:47:19.58 --> 01:47:21.34
The fucking car I said, what fucking car?

1832
01:47:21.34 --> 01:47:23.34
The fucking car that blew up.

1833
01:47:23.34 --> 01:47:24.34
I retorted.

1834
01:47:24.34 --> 01:47:25.34
I don't know.

1835
01:47:25.34 --> 01:47:27.86
It was the fucking telephone that blew up.

1836
01:47:27.86 --> 01:47:29.66
It was an IED.

1837
01:47:29.66 --> 01:47:34.10
I heard someone to my right screaming in the middle of the formation.

1838
01:47:34.10 --> 01:47:39.06
I saw a Marine who was lying on his back and kind of circling in a circle, kicking in a

1839
01:47:39.06 --> 01:47:40.46
circle and grabbing at his arm.

1840
01:47:40.46 --> 01:47:41.46
I'm hit.

1841
01:47:41.46 --> 01:47:42.46
I'm hit.

1842
01:47:42.46 --> 01:47:43.46
I'll fuck.

1843
01:47:43.46 --> 01:47:45.78
I'll tell a Marine who was quickly walking over to him with his arms outstretched, a

1844
01:47:45.78 --> 01:47:46.78
grabman, hold him down.

1845
01:47:46.78 --> 01:47:51.10
I could hear a couple more people to my left yell out that they were also hit.

1846
01:47:51.10 --> 01:47:56.14
There were people all around screaming, a blood curling yell, corpsman up, corpsman up.

1847
01:47:56.14 --> 01:48:01.74
I lay there watching the tumult surround me as if I were the access point of a fucked-up

1848
01:48:01.74 --> 01:48:04.50
war movie and everything just kept revolving around me.

1849
01:48:04.50 --> 01:48:10.26
I was still days but everything still still imprinted upon my mind and high definition.

1850
01:48:10.26 --> 01:48:14.90
Like the turning gears of that finely tuned machine that I had mentioned earlier,

1851
01:48:14.90 --> 01:48:19.10
each Marine or small group of Marines moved at their own quick pace for finding

1852
01:48:19.10 --> 01:48:21.02
cover, helping the wounded.

1853
01:48:21.02 --> 01:48:25.82
Coming up the road to pass orders, setting up fields of fire and preparing themselves

1854
01:48:25.82 --> 01:48:26.82
for a fight.

1855
01:48:26.82 --> 01:48:29.26
They moved without orders.

1856
01:48:29.26 --> 01:48:30.42
It was automatic.

1857
01:48:30.42 --> 01:48:33.86
These guys were so rehearsed that their default went straight to kill mode.

1858
01:48:33.86 --> 01:48:35.22
I was highly impressed.

1859
01:48:35.22 --> 01:48:39.50
The shock of the blast alone should have jangled some nerves and delivered a hiccup into

1860
01:48:39.50 --> 01:48:44.06
their plans but these men were true professionals.

1861
01:48:44.06 --> 01:48:47.70
I then felt something hot pouring down the inside of my left calf.

1862
01:48:47.70 --> 01:48:52.02
I reached down to touch it in my hand brought back a large amount of blood.

1863
01:48:52.02 --> 01:48:53.42
I had no idea where it was coming from.

1864
01:48:53.42 --> 01:48:58.86
My whole body was numb from the blast but it just kept pouring out from somewhere.

1865
01:48:58.86 --> 01:49:02.94
An overwhelming feeling of dread hit me in the fall of my mortality stirred within me

1866
01:49:02.94 --> 01:49:04.30
for a quick second.

1867
01:49:04.30 --> 01:49:09.10
Then the fear from my fellow wounded Marines survival of this situation said in and I hope

1868
01:49:09.10 --> 01:49:10.70
that no one was critically injured.

1869
01:49:10.70 --> 01:49:15.62
I thought if there was more Marines hit like this than we are fucked.

1870
01:49:15.62 --> 01:49:17.66
The bad guy should have been shooting by now.

1871
01:49:17.66 --> 01:49:20.02
How in the hell are we getting it out of here?

1872
01:49:20.02 --> 01:49:21.74
I shouted oh shit.

1873
01:49:21.74 --> 01:49:24.14
I'm hit too.

1874
01:49:24.14 --> 01:49:26.58
Lance Corporal Nion Nion.

1875
01:49:26.58 --> 01:49:30.90
Lance Corporal Nion, my three four Marine who was qualified as a combat lifesaver came running

1876
01:49:30.90 --> 01:49:32.58
over and yelled out I got him.

1877
01:49:32.58 --> 01:49:34.78
I got him.

1878
01:49:34.78 --> 01:49:37.62
He proceeded to pat me down looking for wounds.

1879
01:49:37.62 --> 01:49:40.10
He asked where are you hit.

1880
01:49:40.10 --> 01:49:41.86
I replied I think it's my leg.

1881
01:49:41.86 --> 01:49:43.86
How bad is it?

1882
01:49:43.86 --> 01:49:48.10
He cut my pant leg from the boot all the way up to my belt line looking for the wound.

1883
01:49:48.10 --> 01:49:49.10
You're okay sergeant.

1884
01:49:49.10 --> 01:49:51.30
It's really not that bad but don't look at it.

1885
01:49:51.30 --> 01:49:52.70
He looked over his shoulder.

1886
01:49:52.70 --> 01:49:53.86
Carmen up.

1887
01:49:53.86 --> 01:49:54.98
Then he looked back at me.

1888
01:49:54.98 --> 01:50:05.30
You have a huge hole in your leg but you'll live.

1889
01:50:05.30 --> 01:50:07.94
Well I three former Marines salute.

1890
01:50:07.94 --> 01:50:09.22
Yeah.

1891
01:50:09.22 --> 01:50:14.66
I was very lucky to have been assigned to them.

1892
01:50:14.66 --> 01:50:17.98
Those guys are definitely professional.

1893
01:50:17.98 --> 01:50:21.54
How much interact interoperability training had you done with them prior to going on

1894
01:50:21.54 --> 01:50:22.54
this deployment?

1895
01:50:22.54 --> 01:50:23.54
Nothing.

1896
01:50:23.54 --> 01:50:25.54
So you showed up and went on deployment with it really.

1897
01:50:25.54 --> 01:50:27.54
I got the phone call.

1898
01:50:27.54 --> 01:50:28.54
Good night.

1899
01:50:28.54 --> 01:50:32.02
On Monday when I was delivering mail.

1900
01:50:32.02 --> 01:50:34.54
I said to them all right I'm going.

1901
01:50:34.54 --> 01:50:37.82
All right there right pick up your orders on Tuesday.

1902
01:50:37.82 --> 01:50:39.98
We're leaving on Wednesday.

1903
01:50:39.98 --> 01:50:46.58
Pick up your gear Thursday and early early in the night like two, three o'clock in

1904
01:50:46.58 --> 01:50:47.58
the morning on Friday.

1905
01:50:47.58 --> 01:50:51.42
It's more picking up our weapons and we're getting on the plane.

1906
01:50:51.42 --> 01:50:54.50
It was that one two three go.

1907
01:50:54.50 --> 01:51:02.38
So the whole time when we got stuck with three, four it was language classes, meeting some

1908
01:51:02.38 --> 01:51:05.14
critical guys who was going to be in our team.

1909
01:51:05.14 --> 01:51:12.62
So rehearsing and then we're punching north and it was literally one two three.

1910
01:51:12.62 --> 01:51:15.86
We're now in Hadetha.

1911
01:51:15.86 --> 01:51:28.14
From going from Springfield, Ohio to delivering junk mail in February of 2004 to walking

1912
01:51:28.14 --> 01:51:32.78
the streets of Hadetha and getting blown up.

1913
01:51:32.78 --> 01:51:41.18
Just to great you know again the book is great in this section here.

1914
01:51:41.18 --> 01:51:47.42
When you're talking about like you anticipate once you get blown up you're waiting to

1915
01:51:47.42 --> 01:51:51.26
get the gun fight because that's what the enemy, that's kind of standard operating procedure

1916
01:51:51.26 --> 01:51:52.26
for the enemy.

1917
01:51:52.26 --> 01:51:55.02
They hit you with an ID while there's that chaos and confusion.

1918
01:51:55.02 --> 01:51:57.98
They hit you with small arms fire with some kind of an ambush and that's what you were

1919
01:51:57.98 --> 01:52:00.26
waiting for.

1920
01:52:00.26 --> 01:52:06.68
And fortunately it didn't happen because we were on an elevated dirt road surrounded

1921
01:52:06.68 --> 01:52:10.50
and once you surrounded but we were in a horseshoe of all these buildings around us.

1922
01:52:10.50 --> 01:52:13.30
There's no reason why they shouldn't have been lighteners up.

1923
01:52:13.30 --> 01:52:16.30
They would have had us.

1924
01:52:16.30 --> 01:52:24.02
But they didn't shoot and thank God they didn't because we had our QRF that was out

1925
01:52:24.02 --> 01:52:31.78
in the desert and two Humvees, three Humvees maybe but it was a light patrol and the

1926
01:52:31.78 --> 01:52:38.58
closest help was hours away.

1927
01:52:38.58 --> 01:52:41.14
What was it that it was an ID?

1928
01:52:41.14 --> 01:52:42.14
It was an ID.

1929
01:52:42.14 --> 01:52:46.18
On a phone pole it was a base of the phone pole.

1930
01:52:46.18 --> 01:52:47.18
I tell the phone pole.

1931
01:52:47.18 --> 01:52:50.94
I remember walking up and seeing this trash.

1932
01:52:50.94 --> 01:52:54.94
It was a little clucky.

1933
01:52:54.94 --> 01:53:00.14
We were walking this area was nothing but a dump and with a road but everything in the

1934
01:53:00.14 --> 01:53:02.90
airhole area had sand that was on it.

1935
01:53:02.90 --> 01:53:06.38
Dust and it looked like it's been there for a while except for the base of this phone

1936
01:53:06.38 --> 01:53:07.38
pole.

1937
01:53:07.38 --> 01:53:10.38
But I'm the new guy to this unit.

1938
01:53:10.38 --> 01:53:12.46
I'm thinking what are they doing?

1939
01:53:12.46 --> 01:53:16.30
That doesn't look right but I'm like okay we're these guys know what they're doing.

1940
01:53:16.30 --> 01:53:19.74
I'm going to keep on growing.

1941
01:53:19.74 --> 01:53:23.50
I thought my attention was them letting that car go in there and I'm thinking there's only

1942
01:53:23.50 --> 01:53:25.50
18 guys in my patrol.

1943
01:53:25.50 --> 01:53:28.02
If that thing is a car bomb we're all dead.

1944
01:53:28.02 --> 01:53:31.58
So I'm saying all right, row with it.

1945
01:53:31.58 --> 01:53:36.58
Go up check out the vehicle and then I wave that the guy boom.

1946
01:53:36.58 --> 01:53:41.26
I thought it went off.

1947
01:53:41.26 --> 01:53:44.94
When I got blown up my entire body went numb.

1948
01:53:44.94 --> 01:53:47.86
I didn't feel anything.

1949
01:53:47.86 --> 01:53:52.50
When I said that I didn't know if I was dead I was looking at my arms and legs.

1950
01:53:52.50 --> 01:53:54.34
Seeing if they were still attached.

1951
01:53:54.34 --> 01:53:56.38
I had no idea what was going on.

1952
01:53:56.38 --> 01:54:01.78
So the guy who came in he said he touched the dashboard.

1953
01:54:01.78 --> 01:54:02.78
He touched the dashboard.

1954
01:54:02.78 --> 01:54:05.50
What was that to activate or I don't know.

1955
01:54:05.50 --> 01:54:07.50
My guess is totally unrelated.

1956
01:54:07.50 --> 01:54:14.62
Something it was because he was at the wrong place at the wrong time.

1957
01:54:14.62 --> 01:54:18.30
When I yelled out at hey, where's he at?

1958
01:54:18.30 --> 01:54:20.38
Everybody's like what are you talking about?

1959
01:54:20.38 --> 01:54:24.18
The freaking car that just passed us.

1960
01:54:24.18 --> 01:54:32.06
My entire team, minus one, who was still back at the dam, all this were hit.

1961
01:54:32.06 --> 01:54:36.18
The only person that wasn't hit was at the time gunny balanctine.

1962
01:54:36.18 --> 01:54:38.62
He ended up retiring at Sergeant Major Balanctine.

1963
01:54:38.62 --> 01:54:43.66
But he was about to walk over to my side of the road who was waiting for that car to pass

1964
01:54:43.66 --> 01:54:45.34
by.

1965
01:54:45.34 --> 01:54:51.34
And that IED that car stopped all that that flag from hitting him.

1966
01:54:51.34 --> 01:54:55.06
But years later, and the book is already out.

1967
01:54:55.06 --> 01:54:56.38
I'm giving these presentations.

1968
01:54:56.38 --> 01:55:01.58
He sends me a picture of a part of a radio.

1969
01:55:01.58 --> 01:55:04.14
He says hey bus, you know what this is?

1970
01:55:04.14 --> 01:55:05.98
I'm like now what's going on.

1971
01:55:05.98 --> 01:55:06.98
What is that?

1972
01:55:06.98 --> 01:55:11.06
Because it's part of your freaking radio that you got blowing off your back and embedded

1973
01:55:11.06 --> 01:55:14.38
in my flat jacket across the street from here.

1974
01:55:14.38 --> 01:55:17.38
So yeah, he's got that little trophy.

1975
01:55:17.38 --> 01:55:22.22
But yeah, my handset, cut, cut, and two.

1976
01:55:22.22 --> 01:55:25.38
My antenna was gone.

1977
01:55:25.38 --> 01:55:27.38
Yeah, you go into that here.

1978
01:55:27.38 --> 01:55:28.38
You go lucky.

1979
01:55:28.38 --> 01:55:33.16
And again, skipping a little bit, but a whole-king figure dragging his leg definitely

1980
01:55:33.16 --> 01:55:37.30
resembling the movements of a zombie was making his way up the road.

1981
01:55:37.30 --> 01:55:41.18
It was the friendly Ukrainian born navy corpsman that I had spoken to a few times.

1982
01:55:41.18 --> 01:55:42.18
We had planned to get together.

1983
01:55:42.18 --> 01:55:44.62
He was going to teach me how to speak Russian in our downtime.

1984
01:55:44.62 --> 01:55:46.26
And I was looking forward to it.

1985
01:55:46.26 --> 01:55:52.30
But now the back of his uniform was a solid dirty plum from all the blood lost because

1986
01:55:52.30 --> 01:55:58.74
he had received very painful, shrapnel wounds to the back of both arms, both legs, neck

1987
01:55:58.74 --> 01:56:01.18
and buttocks.

1988
01:56:01.18 --> 01:56:05.18
And he was still dragging himself down the street to get to me as if he had just stepped

1989
01:56:05.18 --> 01:56:07.26
out of a John Wayne movie.

1990
01:56:07.26 --> 01:56:10.70
Lieutenant yelled, Doc, hey, Doc, don't worry about him.

1991
01:56:10.70 --> 01:56:12.70
We'll get him.

1992
01:56:12.70 --> 01:56:16.82
He just raised his hand and dismissed the notion as if he had turned down a drink at

1993
01:56:16.82 --> 01:56:17.82
the bar.

1994
01:56:17.82 --> 01:56:22.82
And his cool ass Ukrainian accent, he just said, no, no, I can get him.

1995
01:56:22.82 --> 01:56:26.22
He reached into his bag and pulled down a thick field dressing and began to read the

1996
01:56:26.22 --> 01:56:27.22
directions.

1997
01:56:27.22 --> 01:56:31.10
And you do a pretty funny little section in there about him.

1998
01:56:31.10 --> 01:56:32.82
Reading the directions that he's supposed to be treating you.

1999
01:56:32.82 --> 01:56:35.42
I was like, what the fuck, Doc, just put the damn thing on.

2000
01:56:35.42 --> 01:56:37.42
I'm bleeding all over the place.

2001
01:56:37.42 --> 01:56:41.78
I'm going to make sure I get this right.

2002
01:56:41.78 --> 01:56:43.26
Major protrusy, is that right?

2003
01:56:43.26 --> 01:56:44.42
protrusy.

2004
01:56:44.42 --> 01:56:49.14
Major protrusy solely approached me and asked, hey, hey, Marine, are you okay?

2005
01:56:49.14 --> 01:56:50.14
Yes, sir.

2006
01:56:50.14 --> 01:56:51.94
I'm just really fucking pissed off right now.

2007
01:56:51.94 --> 01:56:56.54
They blew us up, ripped my trousers, I'm bleeding all over the fucking place.

2008
01:56:56.54 --> 01:56:58.34
And I've been trying to raise Kilo company.

2009
01:56:58.34 --> 01:57:00.22
My radio doesn't seem to work.

2010
01:57:00.22 --> 01:57:05.38
I think that I think that I got it shut off when I tumbled down into the ditch.

2011
01:57:05.38 --> 01:57:06.82
Can you check it for me, sir?

2012
01:57:06.82 --> 01:57:10.90
He agreed and I turned around so you could open my pack and check out the radio.

2013
01:57:10.90 --> 01:57:12.42
He didn't even have to open the pack.

2014
01:57:12.42 --> 01:57:14.02
He said, well, Marine, here's your problem.

2015
01:57:14.02 --> 01:57:17.70
He grabbed the cord to my handset that was in my chin strap, which was now frayed and caught

2016
01:57:17.70 --> 01:57:21.98
away from the radio by the blast, threw it over my shoulder and said, you're antennae is

2017
01:57:21.98 --> 01:57:22.98
gone too.

2018
01:57:22.98 --> 01:57:27.02
And you have a bunch of large metal debris embedded and sticking out of your pack.

2019
01:57:27.02 --> 01:57:28.50
You're all full lucky, Marine.

2020
01:57:28.50 --> 01:57:30.02
It was the understatement of the year.

2021
01:57:30.02 --> 01:57:31.02
The major was right.

2022
01:57:31.02 --> 01:57:32.02
I was lucky as hell.

2023
01:57:32.02 --> 01:57:37.42
I should have been decapitated because my antennae and handset were gone and they just

2024
01:57:37.42 --> 01:57:42.18
and they rested just mere fractions of an inch away from my head on both sides of my neck.

2025
01:57:42.18 --> 01:57:46.34
If I didn't have the radio, I might have been gourd by the large metal debris sticking

2026
01:57:46.34 --> 01:57:47.78
out of my pack.

2027
01:57:47.78 --> 01:57:52.14
And if I had not moved it, that exact second that I did.

2028
01:57:52.14 --> 01:57:54.94
And my leg was one more fraction of an inch over to the left.

2029
01:57:54.94 --> 01:58:00.98
I would have had it blown off or the pieces of shrapnel could have hit me in the formural

2030
01:58:00.98 --> 01:58:04.18
artery possibly causing me to bleed out.

2031
01:58:04.18 --> 01:58:09.74
I think at that exact moment, I was among the luckiest people on the planet.

2032
01:58:09.74 --> 01:58:16.10
I had possessed the winning golden lottery ticket for the rest of my life.

2033
01:58:16.10 --> 01:58:17.74
So yeah, the major was right.

2034
01:58:17.74 --> 01:58:20.98
I was lucky, I guess.

2035
01:58:20.98 --> 01:58:21.98
Yeah.

2036
01:58:21.98 --> 01:58:27.98
And it up, look like an ice cream scoop was pulled out of my calf.

2037
01:58:27.98 --> 01:58:29.22
Outside of my calf.

2038
01:58:29.22 --> 01:58:34.02
Still have a piece of shrapnel right next to my femoral artery on the same leg from

2039
01:58:34.02 --> 01:58:37.34
there which super lucky didn't go any deeper.

2040
01:58:37.34 --> 01:58:43.66
But as big as that blast was, very, very fortunate to be here.

2041
01:58:43.66 --> 01:58:47.54
The guys in the ass ended the patrol said that it blew up more than out.

2042
01:58:47.54 --> 01:58:52.34
So the difference was, is that they buried it too deep.

2043
01:58:52.34 --> 01:58:54.82
If it was 2005, I wouldn't be here.

2044
01:58:54.82 --> 01:59:00.22
But 2004, you know, these are still trying to figure out how to use these against this.

2045
01:59:00.22 --> 01:59:04.54
So yeah.

2046
01:59:04.54 --> 01:59:08.22
Back to the book, it took probably took just a few minutes, but it really felt like hours

2047
01:59:08.22 --> 01:59:09.22
had passed.

2048
01:59:09.22 --> 01:59:18.70
The QRF Humvees quickly rolled down the road and the brake squealed to a stop.

2049
01:59:18.70 --> 01:59:20.50
They get you to like the battlefield treatment center.

2050
01:59:20.50 --> 01:59:24.30
The medical staff was highly rehearsed at taming the confusion and staying focused.

2051
01:59:24.30 --> 01:59:27.78
They darted around each other, grabbing medical supplies, filling out paperwork and rendering

2052
01:59:27.78 --> 01:59:30.06
first aid to each of us wounded guys.

2053
01:59:30.06 --> 01:59:33.70
Like a dance of highly choreographed medical professionals, their battle was to ease the

2054
01:59:33.70 --> 01:59:38.82
suffering of the maimed and sustain the heartbeats of those who needed critical care.

2055
01:59:38.82 --> 01:59:44.46
They were honorable and gallant guardians of life, slapping away the hands of death daily.

2056
01:59:44.46 --> 01:59:48.38
They won most battles, but lost some.

2057
01:59:48.38 --> 01:59:52.78
For those who tirelessly heal the wounds of broken warriors and for those who selflessly

2058
01:59:52.78 --> 01:59:57.46
dedicate themselves in pursuit of easing pain of suffering, I will always be honored to be

2059
01:59:57.46 --> 02:00:03.66
in the presence of such nobility.

2060
02:00:03.66 --> 02:00:12.94
Again, to hold new respect for medical being on those deployments and seeing what these guys

2061
02:00:12.94 --> 02:00:14.94
actually do and more.

2062
02:00:14.94 --> 02:00:18.26
You know, because in peace time, you're like, oh, okay, you're going to get to hang out

2063
02:00:18.26 --> 02:00:22.70
at Docs Place and who needs more IVs and that kind of stuff.

2064
02:00:22.70 --> 02:00:30.42
These guys, and you see them in doing their jobs there, it's awe-inspiring to see how they

2065
02:00:30.42 --> 02:00:36.38
can be as calm and level headed when chaos is just right during their table.

2066
02:00:36.38 --> 02:00:41.30
Yeah, and as I said, opening this thing up, I mean, their face and death all the time,

2067
02:00:41.30 --> 02:00:43.82
and they can't save everybody.

2068
02:00:43.82 --> 02:00:48.46
So there, and there's got to be some level of guilt every time you can't save someone.

2069
02:00:48.46 --> 02:00:51.46
It's like, that's got to chip away at you.

2070
02:00:51.46 --> 02:01:00.54
Yeah, totally heroic, totally heroic are our military medical personnel.

2071
02:01:00.54 --> 02:01:01.82
And luckily they're there.

2072
02:01:01.82 --> 02:01:05.74
They get you guys extracted and you say we floated away.

2073
02:01:05.74 --> 02:01:11.46
We floated on high among the angels inside a rotary winged war course known as the UH60

2074
02:01:11.46 --> 02:01:14.38
Black Hawk Medevac helicopter.

2075
02:01:14.38 --> 02:01:18.50
My war was over and I was regretfully delighted.

2076
02:01:18.50 --> 02:01:22.50
My guilt was that I was leaving my fellow Marines behind to continue the fighting as I was

2077
02:01:22.50 --> 02:01:24.02
going home.

2078
02:01:24.02 --> 02:01:28.14
I knew it wasn't the case, but I had an unbearable feeling that I was abandoning them

2079
02:01:28.14 --> 02:01:31.98
in the middle of a fight against insurmountable odds.

2080
02:01:31.98 --> 02:01:33.78
I wanted to be there alongside them.

2081
02:01:33.78 --> 02:01:35.38
I wanted to bear their burdens.

2082
02:01:35.38 --> 02:01:39.26
I wanted to fight in their fight and I wanted to share in their misery because they were

2083
02:01:39.26 --> 02:01:43.18
my Marine brothers and they were in harm's way.

2084
02:01:43.18 --> 02:01:44.66
I wasn't eager to die.

2085
02:01:44.66 --> 02:01:50.58
I was just eager to serve alongside my brethren when the chips were down and it was time

2086
02:01:50.58 --> 02:01:57.58
to prove our metal.

2087
02:01:57.58 --> 02:02:03.02
You make it to welcome to the Baghdad Combat Support Hospital.

2088
02:02:03.02 --> 02:02:05.26
But we all called the cash.

2089
02:02:05.26 --> 02:02:06.90
You can relax now, Marine.

2090
02:02:06.90 --> 02:02:07.90
You're safe.

2091
02:02:07.90 --> 02:02:09.90
We're going to take good care of you.

2092
02:02:09.90 --> 02:02:16.94
You get a nice smooth, relatively smooth extraction.

2093
02:02:16.94 --> 02:02:19.98
Then a little bit fast forward a little bit.

2094
02:02:19.98 --> 02:02:24.98
Sitting in the spotlight of a humming fluorescent bulb, I dialed the phone and the connection

2095
02:02:24.98 --> 02:02:25.98
led to failure.

2096
02:02:25.98 --> 02:02:26.98
I dialed the phone again.

2097
02:02:26.98 --> 02:02:27.98
Again, failed.

2098
02:02:27.98 --> 02:02:32.82
On the third try, she answered.

2099
02:02:32.82 --> 02:02:36.62
We both had been accustomed to carrying out our phone conversations at an accelerated

2100
02:02:36.62 --> 02:02:37.82
pace.

2101
02:02:37.82 --> 02:02:41.54
It always been limited to just a few minutes and now without missing a beach, she continued

2102
02:02:41.54 --> 02:02:43.70
our dialogue from the past several days.

2103
02:02:43.70 --> 02:02:45.02
I just let her speak.

2104
02:02:45.02 --> 02:02:50.50
It was good to hear her submit the woes of life a million miles away.

2105
02:02:50.50 --> 02:02:54.38
That life seemed so foreign to my reality and I longed for it once again.

2106
02:02:54.38 --> 02:02:57.58
I reluctantly informed her of the events the day.

2107
02:02:57.58 --> 02:03:02.78
Life seemed to stop and the phone nearly hit the ground.

2108
02:03:02.78 --> 02:03:03.78
My words caught.

2109
02:03:03.78 --> 02:03:09.82
The midnight breeze evaporated into the night sky and a world-way away, they manifested

2110
02:03:09.82 --> 02:03:14.14
and struck like daggers in her heart.

2111
02:03:14.14 --> 02:03:15.54
For me this day was done.

2112
02:03:15.54 --> 02:03:19.30
For her, I imagined a day filled with anxiety and angst.

2113
02:03:19.30 --> 02:03:25.18
The father of her child, her husband, was wounded and unsure of his day's ahead.

2114
02:03:25.18 --> 02:03:33.10
I promised myself, from this day on, I would never take life for granted.

2115
02:03:33.10 --> 02:03:40.10
From that day forward, I never did.

2116
02:03:40.10 --> 02:03:44.90
Colin Holmes.

2117
02:03:44.90 --> 02:03:56.22
How long did it take to heal up?

2118
02:03:56.22 --> 02:03:57.70
What in that long?

2119
02:03:57.70 --> 02:04:04.70
I stayed over at 29 p.m. for maybe five, six months.

2120
02:04:04.70 --> 02:04:05.70
It wasn't that long.

2121
02:04:05.70 --> 02:04:08.70
I got my skin graft done.

2122
02:04:08.70 --> 02:04:12.14
I spent most of my time just sitting there hanging out with the guys.

2123
02:04:12.14 --> 02:04:16.06
There was not even a wound of worry, regiment at that time.

2124
02:04:16.06 --> 02:04:18.02
They just basically said, oh, you're wounded.

2125
02:04:18.02 --> 02:04:23.62
Well, here's your barracks and here's a bag full of toiletries.

2126
02:04:23.62 --> 02:04:24.62
That's it.

2127
02:04:24.62 --> 02:04:26.02
Just purport in every Thursday.

2128
02:04:26.02 --> 02:04:27.66
Keep a run clean.

2129
02:04:27.66 --> 02:04:33.98
And so the rest of the time, we were just sitting around and drinking and all it, and I

2130
02:04:33.98 --> 02:04:35.54
didn't know anybody at 20 o'clock.

2131
02:04:35.54 --> 02:04:37.38
Everybody was deployed then.

2132
02:04:37.38 --> 02:04:38.38
Where was your wife?

2133
02:04:38.38 --> 02:04:39.38
My wife was at home.

2134
02:04:39.38 --> 02:04:42.38
You know, in Ohio.

2135
02:04:42.38 --> 02:04:48.14
So I was there with a can of comet and cleaning my floors, making them white, drinking a

2136
02:04:48.14 --> 02:04:50.14
six pack.

2137
02:04:50.14 --> 02:04:53.54
Well, I'm glad we have the wounded warrior now.

2138
02:04:53.54 --> 02:05:00.50
But things, but after I came back from my convulessantly, as soon as I came back, the barracks

2139
02:05:00.50 --> 02:05:03.38
was over flooded with guys.

2140
02:05:03.38 --> 02:05:09.10
Because I came, when I was on my convulessantly, that's when vigilant resolve happened.

2141
02:05:09.10 --> 02:05:11.30
The first push in to Felicia.

2142
02:05:11.30 --> 02:05:19.50
And the guys that I was with, three, four was with them, two, along with 37 and 27.

2143
02:05:19.50 --> 02:05:20.50
I believe.

2144
02:05:20.50 --> 02:05:25.02
And that's when I heard came back, this one we heard about Jason Dunham.

2145
02:05:25.02 --> 02:05:32.90
Everybody was talking about Jason Dunham.

2146
02:05:32.90 --> 02:05:37.54
Once you were healed up, was it back to your reserve status?

2147
02:05:37.54 --> 02:05:42.82
I went back to my reserve status, went back to delivering mail.

2148
02:05:42.82 --> 02:05:48.74
And then that's when they were saying, hey, we're thinking about going back over this time

2149
02:05:48.74 --> 02:05:51.26
back to more jewelry fairs.

2150
02:05:51.26 --> 02:05:53.38
And I put my hand up, said, absolutely.

2151
02:05:53.38 --> 02:05:57.70
If my guys are going, I'm going to be there next to you know.

2152
02:05:57.70 --> 02:06:02.54
At that point, I was one of the most combat experience guys for the more true fairs.

2153
02:06:02.54 --> 02:06:06.06
So I'm, I mean, I shoot, I was just right there.

2154
02:06:06.06 --> 02:06:08.90
So I knew more of the lay of the land and how they're fighting.

2155
02:06:08.90 --> 02:06:12.78
And so I figured if we gather the outside of the wire, I could impart some things that I

2156
02:06:12.78 --> 02:06:14.82
know that might help them.

2157
02:06:14.82 --> 02:06:19.86
And I know that I had a bad feeling about this whole appointment as well.

2158
02:06:19.86 --> 02:06:28.26
Did, did, did they give you any kind of choice where they like, hey, look man, you just got

2159
02:06:28.26 --> 02:06:29.26
wounded.

2160
02:06:29.26 --> 02:06:32.10
Your back was a, it's a mission critical on the list.

2161
02:06:32.10 --> 02:06:35.90
They are happy to take anybody who puts their hand up.

2162
02:06:35.90 --> 02:06:41.94
So you got guys who, I was one of the most senior guys in the semelus.

2163
02:06:41.94 --> 02:06:46.58
I was in it since 1993 when it first came in the unit.

2164
02:06:46.58 --> 02:06:53.82
So for years of not being utilized and trained, you know, properly to all of a sudden,

2165
02:06:53.82 --> 02:06:57.14
we're at the forefront at recovering guys.

2166
02:06:57.14 --> 02:07:02.90
And we were handling remains almost every day.

2167
02:07:02.90 --> 02:07:09.34
Going and making stuff up on the fly because there was no, there was nothing to guide

2168
02:07:09.34 --> 02:07:12.34
this.

2169
02:07:12.34 --> 02:07:20.02
When you raised your hand to volunteer, what was your wife's reaction at this point?

2170
02:07:20.02 --> 02:07:28.26
She wasn't happy, but she understood that she married a Marine.

2171
02:07:28.26 --> 02:07:30.10
And my heart is with them.

2172
02:07:30.10 --> 02:07:37.58
My heart will, you know, if she was to give me an ultimatum that I would take that, I would

2173
02:07:37.58 --> 02:07:38.98
say I'm going.

2174
02:07:38.98 --> 02:07:42.70
I'm going to say it by because I needed to be with my guys.

2175
02:07:42.70 --> 02:07:44.02
I needed to be in that fight.

2176
02:07:44.02 --> 02:07:50.50
So she understood that from the very onset of our relationship.

2177
02:07:50.50 --> 02:07:56.86
And not to say I didn't love my family, but my heart was over there.

2178
02:07:56.86 --> 02:08:06.30
And if I didn't go and something was to happen, and then she knew that, even though

2179
02:08:06.30 --> 02:08:10.06
I wouldn't have, but she didn't want to be put in a place where I would have but

2180
02:08:10.06 --> 02:08:11.86
blamed her.

2181
02:08:11.86 --> 02:08:14.34
So it was easier to let me go over.

2182
02:08:14.34 --> 02:08:19.02
And plus I didn't like delivering mail until you say truth.

2183
02:08:19.02 --> 02:08:26.82
I loved being in and making a difference somewhere because anybody can deliver mail.

2184
02:08:26.82 --> 02:08:30.10
Because when we show up to the next day, you're still going to have a mountain of mail

2185
02:08:30.10 --> 02:08:31.10
to deliver.

2186
02:08:31.10 --> 02:08:34.74
But over there, I felt like we were making a difference that we were doing things that

2187
02:08:34.74 --> 02:08:35.98
were important.

2188
02:08:35.98 --> 02:08:43.26
And my lessons that I was given to the troops and shown them how to patrol, how to, you

2189
02:08:43.26 --> 02:08:46.78
know, how we do things in certain situations.

2190
02:08:46.78 --> 02:08:48.06
It mattered.

2191
02:08:48.06 --> 02:08:53.38
And I was grooming and mentoring leaders to take my role.

2192
02:08:53.38 --> 02:08:55.42
Because I knew I was going to be in its forever.

2193
02:08:55.42 --> 02:08:58.82
And now, no, the mission was still going to continue.

2194
02:08:58.82 --> 02:09:04.70
So I said, yeah, send me back over.

2195
02:09:04.70 --> 02:09:08.94
It's America right there.

2196
02:09:08.94 --> 02:09:11.22
And your wife being supportive.

2197
02:09:11.22 --> 02:09:14.58
That's America.

2198
02:09:14.58 --> 02:09:20.38
So you guys end up going to teach you what we all call teach you, out to get them air

2199
02:09:20.38 --> 02:09:22.26
base.

2200
02:09:22.26 --> 02:09:26.46
And you say, here, I was crazy to volunteer for this again.

2201
02:09:26.46 --> 02:09:28.62
This being my third trip in there in three years.

2202
02:09:28.62 --> 02:09:33.90
I knew that I was putting a lot of strain upon my family back home, but the real world,

2203
02:09:33.90 --> 02:09:35.38
no longer made sense to me anymore.

2204
02:09:35.38 --> 02:09:37.30
Here in combat, I felt alive.

2205
02:09:37.30 --> 02:09:41.86
Here in this ugly world filled with all its lethalities and bloody ends, all this made sense

2206
02:09:41.86 --> 02:09:42.86
to me.

2207
02:09:42.86 --> 02:09:44.22
The rules were very simple.

2208
02:09:44.22 --> 02:09:49.02
Do your best at your job and do your best to stay alive.

2209
02:09:49.02 --> 02:09:55.90
Yeah, there's a, there is absolutely a simplicity in combat where nothing else matters,

2210
02:09:55.90 --> 02:09:59.66
right?

2211
02:09:59.66 --> 02:10:11.90
Now I was back to be the Paltoon Commander for our Mortuary Affairs Detachment and TQ.

2212
02:10:11.90 --> 02:10:14.22
You check in and here we go.

2213
02:10:14.22 --> 02:10:18.70
This is you kind of getting your first visual on what you guys are going to be doing.

2214
02:10:18.70 --> 02:10:22.42
The double doors were held open and suddenly it became very sobering moment to watch the

2215
02:10:22.42 --> 02:10:28.06
formary and scary in a litter with a large black vinyl bag on top.

2216
02:10:28.06 --> 02:10:29.74
There was no mistaking what it was.

2217
02:10:29.74 --> 02:10:34.30
All of us were here for the explicit purpose of taking care of those who were inside

2218
02:10:34.30 --> 02:10:38.90
of them the best way we possibly could, not a whisper was uttered, not a sound was made

2219
02:10:38.90 --> 02:10:42.98
before the remains were lowered to the litter stands and the processing team was ready

2220
02:10:42.98 --> 02:10:45.30
to begin their work.

2221
02:10:45.30 --> 02:10:49.62
We stood out of their way, paying particular attention to the reactions of our Marines,

2222
02:10:49.62 --> 02:10:53.82
shadowing their team to see if they could stomach this kind of work.

2223
02:10:53.82 --> 02:10:56.42
This was the second day of our change over.

2224
02:10:56.42 --> 02:11:01.18
We were just there to observe their Marines and ensure that our Marines were asking all

2225
02:11:01.18 --> 02:11:06.30
the pertinent questions to assure a smooth transition for the transfer of authority.

2226
02:11:06.30 --> 02:11:09.46
So far they were doing just fine.

2227
02:11:09.46 --> 02:11:10.46
Just fine.

2228
02:11:10.46 --> 02:11:16.42
I noticed it immediately and after contemplation I liked the reasoning behind the idea.

2229
02:11:16.42 --> 02:11:21.38
Their major explained that remains were no longer called remains.

2230
02:11:21.38 --> 02:11:25.70
Rather they called them angels.

2231
02:11:25.70 --> 02:11:30.38
That simple change in the lingo encompassed how we felt about the fallen and altered

2232
02:11:30.38 --> 02:11:34.66
how others outside our tight circle viewed them as well.

2233
02:11:34.66 --> 02:11:39.74
Now the official reporting in radio traffic had changed and instead of calling out that

2234
02:11:39.74 --> 02:11:48.50
we had KIAs inbound over the radio it was changed to angel flights or three inbound angels

2235
02:11:48.50 --> 02:11:50.82
on the next yellow.

2236
02:11:50.82 --> 02:11:56.42
It was respectful to those who lost their lives and those units who lost that member of their

2237
02:11:56.42 --> 02:12:02.02
team and I think that it truly helped those of us who did this kind of work to cope with

2238
02:12:02.02 --> 02:12:13.58
the after effects.

2239
02:12:13.58 --> 02:12:18.46
A US Army staff sergeants stood in the back of our small crowd of staff and officers

2240
02:12:18.46 --> 02:12:22.22
kept to himself and watched the Marines on the process in the room floor work.

2241
02:12:22.22 --> 02:12:27.08
It was easy to see that the realization and not fully settled in yet and through his

2242
02:12:27.08 --> 02:12:32.38
classy expression of exhaustion he thanked us for taking care of his major to which we

2243
02:12:32.38 --> 02:12:34.10
applied.

2244
02:12:34.10 --> 02:12:37.18
We are so very sorry for your loss.

2245
02:12:37.18 --> 02:12:41.70
They had both belonged to the same US Army Reserve Unit in Grand Rapids, Michigan and

2246
02:12:41.70 --> 02:12:45.62
had both been out here out there for a few months, Shive a year.

2247
02:12:45.62 --> 02:12:50.82
They both were out together on the desert roads this morning inspecting the many IED

2248
02:12:50.82 --> 02:12:56.42
craters for repairs trying to earn the trust of the Iraqi people and deny al-Qaeda insurgents

2249
02:12:56.42 --> 02:13:00.02
places to hide their bombs.

2250
02:13:00.02 --> 02:13:05.30
Everyone in their unit unit knew that their job in Iraq was extremely dangerous but they

2251
02:13:05.30 --> 02:13:08.74
still did it without complaint.

2252
02:13:08.74 --> 02:13:12.74
Just like the hundreds of times before they had walked up to the crater to inspect it for

2253
02:13:12.74 --> 02:13:17.54
repair before they could commit any of their vehicles and this morning all seemed normal

2254
02:13:17.54 --> 02:13:23.54
but with an a clap of thunder he watched his major disappear into a cloud of dust and sand.

2255
02:13:23.54 --> 02:13:29.38
Now at the end of a long and terrible day he was tasked with escorting the remains of his

2256
02:13:29.38 --> 02:13:39.22
brother-in-law home to his sister's family who at this moment didn't know what had happened yet.

2257
02:13:39.22 --> 02:13:45.54
We all felt terribly sorry for their loss and sacrifice.

2258
02:13:45.54 --> 02:13:48.74
It was time for us to pay our respects to a fallen brother.

2259
02:13:48.74 --> 02:13:55.70
We all gathered around the angels flagged draped transfer case both units and the staff sergeant.

2260
02:13:55.70 --> 02:14:00.42
The chaplain stood at the field of blue and white stars and began with the Bible verse

2261
02:14:00.42 --> 02:14:03.98
John 1513.

2262
02:14:03.98 --> 02:14:10.30
There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends.

2263
02:14:10.30 --> 02:14:15.58
It is within these holy words that our minds were left to wander to try and make sense

2264
02:14:15.58 --> 02:14:18.74
out of the terrible tragedy that lay before us.

2265
02:14:18.74 --> 02:14:23.18
The chaplain continued and I reflected upon the words that he chose.

2266
02:14:23.18 --> 02:14:28.14
This major was a courageous man in service to our country, a man who loved our country so much

2267
02:14:28.14 --> 02:14:33.06
that he was willing to risk death to protect it.

2268
02:14:33.06 --> 02:14:46.42
This morning his dedication had been realized by giving his life for those he loved.

2269
02:14:46.42 --> 02:14:52.82
That's 24 or 48 hours after you guys get on the ground pretty much.

2270
02:14:52.82 --> 02:14:59.42
This is 2005 August, summertime 2005.

2271
02:14:59.42 --> 02:15:04.70
That was right outside of Ramani it's really, really nasty area.

2272
02:15:04.70 --> 02:15:13.50
Little did I know when I got assigned to that place that was the busiest area.

2273
02:15:13.50 --> 02:15:22.58
That was just one among many, many stories that I was like that almost every day.

2274
02:15:22.58 --> 02:15:26.42
It's interesting because you are in the reserves and here you are.

2275
02:15:26.42 --> 02:15:30.54
You have gone in three deployments, you have already been wounded.

2276
02:15:30.54 --> 02:15:33.34
It was the 228 iron soldiers out of Pennsylvania.

2277
02:15:33.34 --> 02:15:39.18
That was the brigade that was there in their national guard unit and they suffered massive

2278
02:15:39.18 --> 02:15:45.18
casualties because they were in Ramani when I arrived there and they were just doing incredible

2279
02:15:45.18 --> 02:15:53.62
incredible job taking the fight to the enemy and they paid the price.

2280
02:15:53.62 --> 02:15:57.30
We say this, we were only three days deep into this deployment and I already could see

2281
02:15:57.30 --> 02:16:00.38
the contrast between this deployment and OIF1.

2282
02:16:00.38 --> 02:16:06.02
This time around we were to learn much more about the angels than what was comfortable.

2283
02:16:06.02 --> 02:16:11.82
Each was to have his or her own distinct story explained by the personal effects that

2284
02:16:11.82 --> 02:16:13.26
he or she carried.

2285
02:16:13.26 --> 02:16:17.50
The brother and arms, the brothers and arms who went for them as they dropped them off

2286
02:16:17.50 --> 02:16:22.42
and the stories of valor in which the angel met his fate.

2287
02:16:22.42 --> 02:16:27.06
There was within these events that the paradox of a mortuary of fairs marine in theater

2288
02:16:27.06 --> 02:16:28.06
rests.

2289
02:16:28.06 --> 02:16:32.70
Do we keep the angel disassociated as much as possible to minimize the after effects of

2290
02:16:32.70 --> 02:16:34.14
such work?

2291
02:16:34.14 --> 02:16:40.06
Or do we embrace the angel's stories honoring their sacrifice and revealing our true feelings

2292
02:16:40.06 --> 02:16:43.34
of empathy to those unit members present?

2293
02:16:43.34 --> 02:16:44.58
Present.

2294
02:16:44.58 --> 02:16:48.70
No matter which path we were to take, it wasn't hard to see that this deployment was going

2295
02:16:48.70 --> 02:16:52.86
to be an extremely long and difficult one.

2296
02:16:52.86 --> 02:16:58.22
With how dangerous Alambar province was, it looked as if we were going to be extremely busy

2297
02:16:58.22 --> 02:17:08.90
for this deployment.

2298
02:17:08.90 --> 02:17:14.22
You guys take over, you have a conversation with your gunny.

2299
02:17:14.22 --> 02:17:17.98
Gunny ski said, did you happen to see all those wrinkles and creases on the angels' flags

2300
02:17:17.98 --> 02:17:19.54
from a couple weeks back?

2301
02:17:19.54 --> 02:17:24.26
He nodded his head, yeah, while I'm aiming to change that.

2302
02:17:24.26 --> 02:17:28.74
So you noticed that the flags that were being put on the caskets were, they were taking

2303
02:17:28.74 --> 02:17:34.46
them straight out of a cardboard box and placed them on to the transfer cases and tied

2304
02:17:34.46 --> 02:17:37.66
out a white cord around it.

2305
02:17:37.66 --> 02:17:39.22
It was not anybody's fault.

2306
02:17:39.22 --> 02:17:43.46
It was just the way it's been always been done.

2307
02:17:43.46 --> 02:17:50.98
When I was with three four, I had found out that a bunch of guys that I had met had gotten

2308
02:17:50.98 --> 02:17:53.26
killed in Felicia.

2309
02:17:53.26 --> 02:17:58.58
One in particular was First Lieutenant Oscar Jimenez.

2310
02:17:58.58 --> 02:18:02.58
I didn't really know him, he decided to him chewing me out.

2311
02:18:02.58 --> 02:18:07.78
Once I had no idea he was a lieutenant, he was walking around without his blouse on.

2312
02:18:07.78 --> 02:18:10.46
Then we got called to a meeting.

2313
02:18:10.46 --> 02:18:12.50
I was trying to get in, he was trying to get out.

2314
02:18:12.50 --> 02:18:16.82
He told me to be the gangway, you're the hell are you.

2315
02:18:16.82 --> 02:18:20.90
I found out who he was.

2316
02:18:20.90 --> 02:18:27.62
When I was on Combo Lesson, the day I left, they come back to 29 palms.

2317
02:18:27.62 --> 02:18:35.06
I noticed that the USA today had a mural of everybody who got killed and his picture was

2318
02:18:35.06 --> 02:18:37.26
pretty much dead center on that.

2319
02:18:37.26 --> 02:18:40.14
I noticed a lot of faces that for the people I knew.

2320
02:18:40.14 --> 02:18:44.30
Particularly with him because he was wearing his dress blues in that picture.

2321
02:18:44.30 --> 02:18:48.54
That was a pretty much a big kick to the stomach to know so many people that was on that

2322
02:18:48.54 --> 02:18:50.54
page.

2323
02:18:50.54 --> 02:18:58.90
Going forward, now I was in charge of the very building that their remains went through.

2324
02:18:58.90 --> 02:19:04.46
I had a connection to that sacrifice because I knew several guys who went through.

2325
02:19:04.46 --> 02:19:11.10
I kind of hurt to think that if that is the flag that gets handed to the families, it needs

2326
02:19:11.10 --> 02:19:14.06
to be treated with the utmost respect.

2327
02:19:14.06 --> 02:19:22.78
It needs to be treated as something that is befitting of a hero because they sacrificed

2328
02:19:22.78 --> 02:19:30.30
their lives for us, their rest of us, not only that sacrifice, but I wanted to honor the

2329
02:19:30.30 --> 02:19:37.02
sacrifice that their families were sent to make because it is them that continue to live

2330
02:19:37.02 --> 02:19:41.98
without that family member.

2331
02:19:41.98 --> 02:19:49.98
These flags is not just another piece of cloth that it is something that is handed down

2332
02:19:49.98 --> 02:19:53.02
from generation to generation to generation.

2333
02:19:53.02 --> 02:19:55.02
It is something that people put up on their mantels.

2334
02:19:55.02 --> 02:19:59.02
It needs to be treated with the utmost respect.

2335
02:19:59.02 --> 02:20:07.74
So after I saw what had happened with that U.S. Army major, I started going down to the P.X.

2336
02:20:07.74 --> 02:20:13.02
I bought one can of starch and I bought their only iron and only iron in board.

2337
02:20:13.02 --> 02:20:17.74
You are not supposed to use starch and combat.

2338
02:20:17.74 --> 02:20:19.98
We are trying to look good for the enemy.

2339
02:20:19.98 --> 02:20:20.98
I took it back.

2340
02:20:20.98 --> 02:20:22.66
Next day there is two cans.

2341
02:20:22.66 --> 02:20:23.66
Next day there is four cans.

2342
02:20:23.66 --> 02:20:30.22
It is kept on doubling up and one day the lady said, hey, what are you doing with all the

2343
02:20:30.22 --> 02:20:31.22
starch?

2344
02:20:31.22 --> 02:20:33.22
You are here at the same time, it was every day.

2345
02:20:33.22 --> 02:20:37.74
I said, man, I am iron and I am searching every American flag before we put them on the

2346
02:20:37.74 --> 02:20:40.66
transfer cases.

2347
02:20:40.66 --> 02:20:46.22
We even came up with our own fold because before the flag was in danger of touching the

2348
02:20:46.22 --> 02:20:48.10
ground.

2349
02:20:48.10 --> 02:20:51.10
I wanted to treat them with the utmost respect.

2350
02:20:51.10 --> 02:20:56.58
We tied the white cord first, tucked it down on the sides and then it was out of the way

2351
02:20:56.58 --> 02:21:06.38
for the honor guard and it stood at state and eventually got adopted by all the branches.

2352
02:21:06.38 --> 02:21:12.78
That became the standard operating procedure.

2353
02:21:12.78 --> 02:21:18.62
We would iron it so much that when you walked around it, it would gleam in the light.

2354
02:21:18.62 --> 02:21:26.78
Back in 2009, I am back in Ohio and I get a phone call from staff, and he is there

2355
02:21:26.78 --> 02:21:30.78
in DC and he goes, hey, bus.

2356
02:21:30.78 --> 02:21:38.10
Brigadier General, so-and-so was there at Ramstein and he is watching a Ramps ceremony and

2357
02:21:38.10 --> 02:21:41.94
his entourage and the first one comes off and it is done the old style.

2358
02:21:41.94 --> 02:21:44.38
The second one comes off and it is done the old style.

2359
02:21:44.38 --> 02:21:49.62
He goes, damn it, I know Marines did that.

2360
02:21:49.62 --> 02:21:53.62
I am going to find out who and am going to find out.

2361
02:21:53.62 --> 02:21:56.90
Let them know what it means to me and my entourage.

2362
02:21:56.90 --> 02:22:05.30
He called up chief Warren for IITIS in DC and she said, yes sir, we called the bus one method.

2363
02:22:05.30 --> 02:22:07.10
Bus started that back in 2005.

2364
02:22:07.10 --> 02:22:08.30
We adopted it.

2365
02:22:08.30 --> 02:22:13.70
We now made it that everybody that we handle in the Marines handle, we do it this way.

2366
02:22:13.70 --> 02:22:17.66
It was from now on until the end of the Marine Corps when the country no longer needs a

2367
02:22:17.66 --> 02:22:20.50
Marine Corps, we are going to do it this way.

2368
02:22:20.50 --> 02:22:25.58
Anybody gets killed in combat or dies overseas, they are going to come home this way.

2369
02:22:25.58 --> 02:22:26.58
It was adopted.

2370
02:22:26.58 --> 02:22:30.18
First it was the Army and then the Navy and now the Air Force.

2371
02:22:30.18 --> 02:22:35.62
If you watch the guys get unloaded from Benghazi, that is my ceremony.

2372
02:22:35.62 --> 02:22:36.62
That is my flag.

2373
02:22:36.62 --> 02:22:41.10
The guys from Ramps ceremonies nowadays, it is done that way.

2374
02:22:41.10 --> 02:22:46.46
The guys come and home from North Korea being repatriated from Tarawa.

2375
02:22:46.46 --> 02:22:47.82
It is done that way.

2376
02:22:47.82 --> 02:22:54.46
It was my little 15 minutes of fame, my little thing that I did.

2377
02:22:54.46 --> 02:22:56.78
I never got to add a boy at it or anything like that.

2378
02:22:56.78 --> 02:22:57.78
But I didn't do it for that.

2379
02:22:57.78 --> 02:23:02.22
I did it because that needed to be done.

2380
02:23:02.22 --> 02:23:08.50
I needed to be, these guys needed to be honored.

2381
02:23:08.50 --> 02:23:14.90
The best way we could bestow upon them because they are heroes.

2382
02:23:14.90 --> 02:23:24.02
If you see sacrifice every day, as we did, the ultimate sacrifice every day and it really

2383
02:23:24.02 --> 02:23:26.14
sticks with you.

2384
02:23:26.14 --> 02:23:29.18
So I am glad that I had my little hand at that.

2385
02:23:29.18 --> 02:23:40.30
That is what I will live on with those guys.

2386
02:23:40.30 --> 02:23:46.54
As you mentioned earlier, talking about going out and setting up security and recovering

2387
02:23:46.54 --> 02:23:56.18
from on-scene, this is not a job where you are always in a safe and secure area to conduct

2388
02:23:56.18 --> 02:23:58.86
your procedures.

2389
02:23:58.86 --> 02:24:07.62
At one point, you get called out to Ramadi to help recover remains from a Bradley fighting

2390
02:24:07.62 --> 02:24:10.62
vehicle.

2391
02:24:10.62 --> 02:24:16.02
You arrive on scene there and I am going to go to the book on scene.

2392
02:24:16.02 --> 02:24:21.42
They are lay a sickening black smudge of charred butchery of a burned out M2A2 Bradley

2393
02:24:21.42 --> 02:24:22.42
fighting vehicle.

2394
02:24:22.42 --> 02:24:23.42
It stole my breath.

2395
02:24:23.42 --> 02:24:27.02
It broke my heart and my soul earned another shade of hate to know that there were five

2396
02:24:27.02 --> 02:24:31.26
men trapped in there when it was blown up by an ID inside the city.

2397
02:24:31.26 --> 02:24:37.42
Out of those five, there were still three soldiers unaccounted for, buried among that twisted,

2398
02:24:37.42 --> 02:24:39.58
burned mess of steel and wire.

2399
02:24:39.58 --> 02:24:44.86
This was the reason why we were flown out here to camp Ramadi to recover the remains

2400
02:24:44.86 --> 02:24:50.78
of these three fallen heroes and return them home with honor.

2401
02:24:50.78 --> 02:24:56.42
The Bradley was placed upon a low flat bed trailer and transported there to the Pennsylvania

2402
02:24:56.42 --> 02:25:04.70
National Guard's compound.

2403
02:25:04.70 --> 02:25:10.06
And again, you do a really good job detailing how this unfolded.

2404
02:25:10.06 --> 02:25:13.90
But to get into some of it, you say there is a process to such complicated manners and

2405
02:25:13.90 --> 02:25:19.02
approach to methodically separate the angels from ruin and to make sense out of such a horrific

2406
02:25:19.02 --> 02:25:20.22
carnage.

2407
02:25:20.22 --> 02:25:23.94
One section, one bucket and one shovel full of debris at a time.

2408
02:25:23.94 --> 02:25:29.38
This was painstaking work requiring us to dig by hand, sort through the debris with a homemade

2409
02:25:29.38 --> 02:25:34.58
sifter and capture and document each tiny piece of human remains or personal effects

2410
02:25:34.58 --> 02:25:35.58
found.

2411
02:25:35.58 --> 02:25:39.58
It was going to take a little time, the right tools and a whole bunch of luck to find the

2412
02:25:39.58 --> 02:25:44.86
right pieces of these guys that still had enough DNA material that was usable to positively

2413
02:25:44.86 --> 02:25:46.42
identify them.

2414
02:25:46.42 --> 02:25:51.46
Our approach had to be rude in science and we had to treat this as a crime scene because

2415
02:25:51.46 --> 02:25:53.42
in the end it was.

2416
02:25:53.42 --> 02:25:58.42
Our job was to capture every article of personal effects and every particle of human tissue

2417
02:25:58.42 --> 02:26:00.18
that was humanly possible.

2418
02:26:00.18 --> 02:26:04.94
We were to create a topographical map of the recovery site to document their locations

2419
02:26:04.94 --> 02:26:09.70
inside the burned out Bradley so that anyone who read my report even years later could

2420
02:26:09.70 --> 02:26:15.26
see the exact layout of how we found it.

2421
02:26:15.26 --> 02:26:19.54
The difficult thing was that there was nothing recognizable left to document.

2422
02:26:19.54 --> 02:26:24.50
The Bradley had been literally blown apart from the floor up and when the lightweight aluminum

2423
02:26:24.50 --> 02:26:32.38
composite armor melted in on top of itself.

2424
02:26:32.38 --> 02:26:39.22
You described that here a little bit fueled by magnetic temperatures, the fire melted

2425
02:26:39.22 --> 02:26:40.82
metal like wax.

2426
02:26:40.82 --> 02:26:45.18
In the interior thousands of metal tear drop shaped pools lined the wreckage.

2427
02:26:45.18 --> 02:26:48.06
Their sharp pointed ends greeted us like hungry daggers.

2428
02:26:48.06 --> 02:26:53.34
The Bradley fighting vehicles mortal wound, a blast opening several feet wide, cross the

2429
02:26:53.34 --> 02:26:56.82
left side under carrots just behind the driver seat.

2430
02:26:56.82 --> 02:27:01.54
Malton metal escaped through the wide, crevoss and quickly cooled into a very thick layered

2431
02:27:01.54 --> 02:27:05.14
puddle of shiny alloy metal beneath the Bradley.

2432
02:27:05.14 --> 02:27:10.54
Springs ejected from magazine splintered metal components and mangled weapon barrels protruded

2433
02:27:10.54 --> 02:27:14.82
from the slag as if a river of wreckage were frozen in time.

2434
02:27:14.82 --> 02:27:19.38
Mass casings from a multitude of calibers littered the floor covering the back of the

2435
02:27:19.38 --> 02:27:22.70
troop compartment from a few inches to greater.

2436
02:27:22.70 --> 02:27:27.34
The ammunition boxes or magazines that once held them had burst open and were punctured

2437
02:27:27.34 --> 02:27:28.78
from the inside out.

2438
02:27:28.78 --> 02:27:33.58
Fire ravaged junks and boxes had been ripped from their homes and now lay in the tango.

2439
02:27:33.58 --> 02:27:36.30
Their conduit and wires hanging limp and frayed.

2440
02:27:36.30 --> 02:27:42.02
The smell was an overpowering bokeh of burned electronics, missed with a slight ashy smell

2441
02:27:42.02 --> 02:27:44.42
of an all-consuming inferno.

2442
02:27:44.42 --> 02:27:53.06
This fire was so intense that it turned everything into a light, wispy dust.

2443
02:27:53.06 --> 02:27:57.30
In the troop compartment, the thick conduit and wires that stretched throughout the scene

2444
02:27:57.30 --> 02:27:58.98
were pulled back and cut.

2445
02:27:58.98 --> 02:28:02.86
The metal junction boxes were inspected and stacked among the refuse pile.

2446
02:28:02.86 --> 02:28:09.02
The thick blanket made of twisted debris and top grayish ash was slowly pulled back one bucket

2447
02:28:09.02 --> 02:28:13.54
of time only to reveal the grim story of the two warriors that were found in the rear

2448
02:28:13.54 --> 02:28:15.94
of this Bradley.

2449
02:28:15.94 --> 02:28:28.50
These two angels were documented on the site sketch as R1 and R2.

2450
02:28:28.50 --> 02:28:34.42
So this is, I talk about this many times.

2451
02:28:34.42 --> 02:28:41.62
This vehicle graveyard that existed in the body of, I was probably 75 to 100 vehicles

2452
02:28:41.62 --> 02:28:48.42
easy and just every one of them in various states of destruction and when you bypass that

2453
02:28:48.42 --> 02:28:55.22
in it for whatever reason they put that vehicle graveyard on the road.

2454
02:28:55.22 --> 02:28:57.18
I mean I guess they did it because it was a simple place.

2455
02:28:57.18 --> 02:29:01.22
You get back in the compound, you take a left and there's the vehicle graveyard.

2456
02:29:01.22 --> 02:29:06.94
But just kind of FYI every time anyone rolled out the gate, the last thing they saw was

2457
02:29:06.94 --> 02:29:08.82
that vehicle graveyard.

2458
02:29:08.82 --> 02:29:13.86
And there's no possible way you could be sitting in a Humvee or a Bradley or an Abrams

2459
02:29:13.86 --> 02:29:20.82
and go by that vehicle graveyard with 100 destroyed burned out vehicles in there and not

2460
02:29:20.82 --> 02:29:28.66
think to yourself, okay, could be the day.

2461
02:29:28.66 --> 02:29:36.78
You guys are doing a ton of work to rip this thing apart all by hand with sledchammers.

2462
02:29:36.78 --> 02:29:39.82
We had never seen anything like this ever.

2463
02:29:39.82 --> 02:29:44.42
As far as I knew nobody had ever seen anything like it before.

2464
02:29:44.42 --> 02:29:46.94
Nobody has ever shared that with us.

2465
02:29:46.94 --> 02:29:49.90
So we're looking at this stuff, a melted vehicle.

2466
02:29:49.90 --> 02:29:54.18
World War II manuals, you're talking about all steel vehicles.

2467
02:29:54.18 --> 02:29:56.30
You can blow those up, it's a pieces.

2468
02:29:56.30 --> 02:30:02.34
But this is felt totally casing, things, people.

2469
02:30:02.34 --> 02:30:09.18
And we literally were swinging and breaking things with a sledchamer and they made, they fabricated

2470
02:30:09.18 --> 02:30:14.86
tools for us to go out there and try to pry the layers apart.

2471
02:30:14.86 --> 02:30:21.34
And we literally took what was left and made them into separated men and depiles.

2472
02:30:21.34 --> 02:30:27.22
And there had to have been millions of pieces, millions of pieces that we went through.

2473
02:30:27.22 --> 02:30:32.02
Nobody ever prepared us for that.

2474
02:30:32.02 --> 02:30:34.02
And it's taking you days.

2475
02:30:34.02 --> 02:30:36.02
Yes.

2476
02:30:36.02 --> 02:30:38.66
And this hard labor, prying this thing apart.

2477
02:30:38.66 --> 02:30:40.58
And then you go to this point here.

2478
02:30:40.58 --> 02:30:44.58
Slowly the layers of melted metal into a brief gateway and revealed its secrets.

2479
02:30:44.58 --> 02:30:49.62
The heavily damaged remains of one US Army soldier inside the tight confines of where the

2480
02:30:49.62 --> 02:30:55.38
turret turret would normally have been was a char torso lying on his back.

2481
02:30:55.38 --> 02:30:59.02
Semi embedded into the once viscous metal floor.

2482
02:30:59.02 --> 02:31:03.94
His right shoulder and right upper arm reached out toward the hole where we were able

2483
02:31:03.94 --> 02:31:07.34
to recover his forearm up to the elbow the prior day.

2484
02:31:07.34 --> 02:31:11.26
Just inches above the torso buried deep in the amygdala.

2485
02:31:11.26 --> 02:31:17.02
Was the back half of a human skull minus any fragments or facial or lower mandible bones.

2486
02:31:17.02 --> 02:31:22.22
Only the interior fossa down the posterior cranial fossa were present.

2487
02:31:22.22 --> 02:31:27.06
Just a few inches away from that also deeply buried with a remnants of one burned Kevlar

2488
02:31:27.06 --> 02:31:28.86
helmet.

2489
02:31:28.86 --> 02:31:37.18
The atmosphere was electric but then quickly turned into a somber tone we had found our

2490
02:31:37.18 --> 02:31:43.06
three.

2491
02:31:43.06 --> 02:31:49.54
So this was just kind of a different kind of mission for you guys because it was your first

2492
02:31:49.54 --> 02:31:54.18
time picking apart a scene like that than the helicopter.

2493
02:31:54.18 --> 02:31:58.98
You know, we had never seen anything else like it before.

2494
02:31:58.98 --> 02:32:04.98
Most of the recoveries are going to be where similar situations but most of the remains

2495
02:32:04.98 --> 02:32:08.82
that we would handle were coming to us.

2496
02:32:08.82 --> 02:32:15.78
Only if the unit was engaged and couldn't break away or the scene was too catastrophic

2497
02:32:15.78 --> 02:32:17.62
they would send us out.

2498
02:32:17.62 --> 02:32:25.94
This was a scene that they had no idea how to determine what was what and I was expecting

2499
02:32:25.94 --> 02:32:30.42
okay well I can't you guys recover you know when you're telling us over the phone and

2500
02:32:30.42 --> 02:32:37.78
when we showed up it was at you totally understood from what a gigantic armor personnel

2501
02:32:37.78 --> 02:32:42.14
carrier to all of a sudden being you know maybe chest high.

2502
02:32:42.14 --> 02:32:49.14
The thing that is is high as it's it's tracks everything else was gone.

2503
02:32:49.14 --> 02:32:57.38
Well you guys and there was the gunner and the driver or the gunner and the VC had been

2504
02:32:57.38 --> 02:33:02.90
thrown from the vehicle and recovered it was the driver and the VC and then he had two

2505
02:33:02.90 --> 02:33:04.22
guys in the back.

2506
02:33:04.22 --> 02:33:10.22
We were still looking you know we did the driver the VC two guys in the back we're

2507
02:33:10.22 --> 02:33:19.42
still looking for the gunner and we had no idea because when we first got the word we were

2508
02:33:19.42 --> 02:33:25.38
looking for three we're looking for three remains so we fly out there we find three remains.

2509
02:33:25.38 --> 02:33:30.90
What you're looking for and which which counts you as an angel is not your head or your arms

2510
02:33:30.90 --> 02:33:40.18
it's your your torso so we find the remnants of three torso and

2511
02:33:40.18 --> 02:33:48.06
we go back and two weeks later we get a phone call that none of the DNA is matching

2512
02:33:48.06 --> 02:33:53.46
up to their gunner and we're like that's impossible out of all those millions of

2513
02:33:53.46 --> 02:33:59.14
remains pieces fragments there's nothing coming back for your gunner so we go

2514
02:33:59.14 --> 02:34:07.10
out there again and there's looking again break it apart further nothing we and we

2515
02:34:07.10 --> 02:34:14.34
go out there maybe a total four or five times and five weeks later they ended up

2516
02:34:14.34 --> 02:34:22.62
finding the person and at the very end of this long mystery it turned out that

2517
02:34:22.62 --> 02:34:31.30
what we thought was R3 was actually a part of a guy that the recovery on the

2518
02:34:31.30 --> 02:34:38.14
scene when they did initial explosion they said that his front half blew up but

2519
02:34:38.14 --> 02:34:43.70
his back half fell back in and got encased in metal so we were both right that

2520
02:34:43.70 --> 02:34:53.30
they treated the one out there as a torso as an angel and we did too and what

2521
02:34:53.30 --> 02:35:00.70
had happened to the gunner was the ID breached right behind where he sat and when the

2522
02:35:00.70 --> 02:35:07.14
vehicle melted it carried the bones out underneath the vehicle and it got in

2523
02:35:07.14 --> 02:35:13.54
case under 12 inches of slag metal underneath the vehicle and it's first time

2524
02:35:13.54 --> 02:35:18.50
we've ever ever seen anything like that you know we hit that piece

2525
02:35:18.50 --> 02:35:24.46
sledge hammers try to break it and stuff and it wouldn't come apart but you

2526
02:35:24.46 --> 02:35:30.30
know with logic looking a square in a face to say hey we found three we

2527
02:35:30.30 --> 02:35:36.14
were breaking you know we can't find any more remains and so what had happened was

2528
02:35:36.14 --> 02:35:40.38
they decided that we were going to send this the rest of this vehicle back to

2529
02:35:40.38 --> 02:35:44.94
the states and look through it by a mass spectrometer and try to find any

2530
02:35:44.94 --> 02:35:52.86
any voice and when they were lifting it up the bottom piece that all the

2531
02:35:52.86 --> 02:35:57.06
run off when they lifted that up it broke in pieces and all the bones were falling

2532
02:35:57.06 --> 02:36:06.06
yeah but I remember you know right before I was the called the end of the

2533
02:36:06.06 --> 02:36:13.02
initial recovery and I didn't feel right about it and I kept on feeling like I

2534
02:36:13.02 --> 02:36:17.94
needed to be drawn to this blast hole even though logically they looked for

2535
02:36:17.94 --> 02:36:23.42
three I found three that kind of thing but I felt like it wasn't finished and

2536
02:36:23.42 --> 02:36:29.38
after the five weeks of recovery you know I think back at maybe it was his

2537
02:36:29.38 --> 02:36:35.42
spirit letting me know that here this is where I am don't quit don't quit you

2538
02:36:35.42 --> 02:36:42.62
know now but I know it's not my fault or anything but I still blame myself

2539
02:36:42.62 --> 02:36:49.50
you know for putting his family through you know five weeks of hell just just

2540
02:36:49.50 --> 02:36:57.86
because you know I should have listened to my my gut feeling but you know that's

2541
02:36:57.86 --> 02:37:05.02
this things that we take away from it but yeah you know I didn't go into too

2542
02:37:05.02 --> 02:37:09.22
much detail but he actually got reported as missing in action at some point

2543
02:37:09.22 --> 02:37:14.70
which was like the second missing in action yeah so it was like you said it's a

2544
02:37:14.70 --> 02:37:20.02
nightmare it is a nightmare being on my hand and I'm thinking all of the

2545
02:37:20.02 --> 02:37:26.10
things that could have happened like did his remains get ejected or we waiting

2546
02:37:26.10 --> 02:37:31.94
for a video to show up with a captured set of remains were they gonna booby

2547
02:37:31.94 --> 02:37:36.74
trap his remains and for us to go out there and find him and try to get more

2548
02:37:36.74 --> 02:37:44.10
of us are they gonna ransom it you know what are they gonna do and and this all

2549
02:37:44.10 --> 02:37:52.26
these different scenarios are popping up and and all of them were viable but

2550
02:37:52.26 --> 02:37:59.06
we had no idea it's like he just disappeared you know nobody ever thought

2551
02:37:59.06 --> 02:38:03.82
that a person could literally melt through a vehicle and what we were looking

2552
02:38:03.82 --> 02:38:14.06
at it crazy crazy you guys and again this just kind of goes to the nature

2553
02:38:14.06 --> 02:38:17.94
of the war that was happening in Alambar province and in Ramadhi you guys go

2554
02:38:17.94 --> 02:38:28.62
back to Ramadhi again to get another blown up Bradley and you say here and

2555
02:38:28.62 --> 02:38:34.38
this one you actually go on scene right you say here few few laden earth and

2556
02:38:34.38 --> 02:38:39.14
oily ash made dark smudges upon my uniform as the distinct pungent smell of

2557
02:38:39.14 --> 02:38:43.82
the still smoldering M2A2 Bradley fighting vehicle lingered heavy in the air it's

2558
02:38:43.82 --> 02:38:49.98
complexities of varying distinctive stenches ranged from burn wires burned

2559
02:38:49.98 --> 02:38:58.94
diesel fuel burned ammunition and the heavy greasy smell of burned people

2560
02:38:58.94 --> 02:39:03.30
my team and I had been now been up for nearly 30 hours straight and I was

2561
02:39:03.30 --> 02:39:06.50
miles beyond exhaustion from the nearly continuous pumping of adrenaline

2562
02:39:06.50 --> 02:39:11.46
through my system and this is because you're on senior in your in the field

2563
02:39:11.46 --> 02:39:16.02
in your body what had happened was is that we've they've got word that an incident

2564
02:39:16.02 --> 02:39:20.22
happened so they were playing this all right we're gonna bring it the vehicle back

2565
02:39:20.22 --> 02:39:25.38
to to uh... ticket we're not we're now they kept on going back and forth and

2566
02:39:25.38 --> 02:39:29.86
and so my team is ready to do a they know for just like how we did in

2567
02:39:29.86 --> 02:39:34.14
Ramadhi the other one for them to bring the vehicle to us on a low boy and for

2568
02:39:34.14 --> 02:39:39.66
us to work so we were up the whole night prior working on other remains and

2569
02:39:39.66 --> 02:39:42.46
you know getting those guys going home then all of a sudden

2570
02:39:42.46 --> 02:39:46.06
we're standing a team up we're gonna go out and then we're like okay we are

2571
02:39:46.06 --> 02:39:50.06
going out after many many hours of this back and forth

2572
02:39:50.06 --> 02:39:54.06
so we were exhausted you know thirty plus hours of being awake

2573
02:39:54.06 --> 02:39:57.58
and we show up to the scene and we show up to this you know

2574
02:39:57.58 --> 02:40:02.06
another incident that claims to have and why did they send you guys into the field to

2575
02:40:02.06 --> 02:40:05.02
do the recovery because that are putting it on like how they had to

2576
02:40:05.02 --> 02:40:09.58
bring it back they tried they were putting it on an at a 88 but they had

2577
02:40:09.58 --> 02:40:15.02
seven guys and the scene was too catastrophic they got hit right next to a big

2578
02:40:15.02 --> 02:40:20.22
open field that had like wheat or something growing on it so they were

2579
02:40:20.22 --> 02:40:23.50
afraid that remains were out there or they didn't know if we're in

2580
02:40:23.50 --> 02:40:27.34
Ramadhi's were under it and plus when they have that much fire in this

2581
02:40:27.34 --> 02:40:31.42
vehicle and the tool missiles are going off in the back of it and it's melting

2582
02:40:31.42 --> 02:40:37.18
that regular you know people can't tell what is what so what they think is

2583
02:40:37.18 --> 02:40:43.58
a piece of plastic silicon could actually be built and so they wanted people who

2584
02:40:43.58 --> 02:40:49.42
were experienced to know what what is what and be able to capture everything that we

2585
02:40:49.42 --> 02:40:56.70
could and but that scene was literally catastrophic it was the biggest

2586
02:40:56.70 --> 02:41:03.26
idea creator I've ever seen you say here I was shaking from the cold shaking

2587
02:41:03.26 --> 02:41:06.62
from the declining adrenaline shaking from the over consumption of coffee

2588
02:41:06.62 --> 02:41:11.10
and shaking from the terrible fear of my impending death my stomach turned

2589
02:41:11.10 --> 02:41:16.86
a nervous caffeine laden reflux up my digestive track that only pride kept down

2590
02:41:16.86 --> 02:41:21.26
I'd taken too many chances in my tours over here I'd overplayed too many hands

2591
02:41:21.26 --> 02:41:26.86
and this was my last of nine lives this was Ramadhi the devil's playground

2592
02:41:26.86 --> 02:41:32.78
luck as a shelf life and mine was set to expire my only two hopes were that when the end

2593
02:41:32.78 --> 02:41:39.74
came it would come fast and my body would be viewable so my family at home could have the luxury

2594
02:41:39.74 --> 02:41:46.86
of closure each breath I took felt borrowed and every check of my watch brought disbelief

2595
02:41:46.86 --> 02:41:50.30
that we had lived a few more minutes longer

2596
02:41:56.38 --> 02:42:01.82
you get a little you get a little briefing from the army captain we came from that direction

2597
02:42:01.82 --> 02:42:05.26
and we were heading in that direction toward those buildings early last night the US army

2598
02:42:05.26 --> 02:42:09.82
captain vehicle commander of the Bradley that transported us here said jestering with a knife

2599
02:42:09.82 --> 02:42:15.66
in hand this was a joint US Iraqi security security force patrol so there were five

2600
02:42:15.66 --> 02:42:21.10
Americans and two ISFs in there the vehicle commander was ejected when it happened so we already

2601
02:42:21.10 --> 02:42:26.46
have him recovered he was a good man what a fucking shame he pointed down the road that

2602
02:42:26.46 --> 02:42:32.30
led off into the indistinguishable unknown of the delicate mist be careful the security team walked

2603
02:42:32.30 --> 02:42:36.22
in that area a couple hours ago and the insurgents tried to get them by blowing up another big

2604
02:42:36.22 --> 02:42:41.82
ID down that way those guys got lucky and nobody got hurt so don't have any of your guys go down

2605
02:42:41.82 --> 02:42:48.06
there and stay off the sides of the road we don't know what's in that area the ID creator was the

2606
02:42:48.06 --> 02:42:54.46
biggest I had ever seen taking up the entire road and it was just as deep as it was wide the Bradley

2607
02:42:54.46 --> 02:43:00.38
suffered such a catastrophic blow that it was in several pieces the heavy diesel engine was ejected

2608
02:43:00.38 --> 02:43:06.30
it's turret now lying 40 yards away and upside down and there was a whole several feet wide in

2609
02:43:06.30 --> 02:43:14.22
the center of the chassis the vehicle was held together only by half of the frame the EOD professional

2610
02:43:14.22 --> 02:43:19.74
slowly let solely yet cautiously work their way towards the smoldering mechanical carcass deliberately

2611
02:43:19.74 --> 02:43:24.06
picking up the unexploded rounds along the way the rounds were meticulously collected

2612
02:43:24.06 --> 02:43:29.66
and set into a pile of short distance from the Bradley my SNR team ready the body bags as I

2613
02:43:29.66 --> 02:43:35.10
began to wonder if we brought enough of them for all the pieces of these poor guys

2614
02:43:36.70 --> 02:43:42.86
the vehicle was actually going this way and the ID went off and it ended up going that way

2615
02:43:43.74 --> 02:43:47.50
it was pointed in the total opposite direction of the way it was traveling

2616
02:43:48.54 --> 02:43:53.26
the turret was popped off of it and it was open the I mean literally you can walk in from one end to

2617
02:43:53.26 --> 02:43:58.22
the other end with your arm straight out and not touch a thing it was totally wide open just like

2618
02:43:58.22 --> 02:44:05.42
the other one was and you know and there was remains you know pretty much everywhere it was just

2619
02:44:06.14 --> 02:44:09.26
a bad scene

2620
02:44:10.78 --> 02:44:15.74
it might have taken maybe 30 minutes before EOD was done we had to start counting the remains so

2621
02:44:15.74 --> 02:44:20.54
that we had all seven accounted for sergeant Kinley, Corporal Thomas and I began to search

2622
02:44:20.54 --> 02:44:25.02
the incident site while each of us counted out loud cautiously crawling into the Bradley

2623
02:44:25.02 --> 02:44:29.34
barely able to distinguish human remains from the charred remains of the tankled mess of burn

2624
02:44:29.34 --> 02:44:35.58
wires and jagged metal the vehicle commander is already recovered so that makes one there's the

2625
02:44:35.58 --> 02:44:43.02
driver he makes two a few seconds went by there's three four and five a few more moments went by

2626
02:44:43.02 --> 02:44:49.82
and six I think yeah that makes six we walked around looking for number seven and he was nowhere to be

2627
02:44:49.82 --> 02:45:02.54
found again you fast forwarding a bit you guys continue to search and then finally I think I see

2628
02:45:02.54 --> 02:45:06.30
a heel of a boot under those wires there hey Kinley come here and check it out can you see what I'm

2629
02:45:06.30 --> 02:45:11.42
pointing at I said he leaned over and pulled some wires out of the way being go I think we've got

2630
02:45:11.42 --> 02:45:15.10
him we found number seven hey Thomas helped me out here

2631
02:45:15.10 --> 02:45:21.90
shit he stuck 20 minutes passed slowly 20 long minutes of watching the exhausted

2632
02:45:21.90 --> 02:45:26.06
ebs and flows of tattered emotions of the faces of those present trapped in a ripped

2633
02:45:26.06 --> 02:45:33.02
tide of fatigue on certain gen discussed I knew him he was my friend the M88 tank

2634
02:45:33.02 --> 02:45:38.14
record operator confided in me as the boom of the colossal machine easily lifted the

2635
02:45:38.14 --> 02:45:44.86
turd into the air freeing the trapped angel my guys quickly freed him from the wires and began to

2636
02:45:44.86 --> 02:45:52.30
carry him away he didn't deserve to die this way this is fucking terrible I took my eyes off the scene and

2637
02:45:52.30 --> 02:46:01.58
looked at him the tank record operator tears had tears streaming down his face and he looked over

2638
02:46:01.58 --> 02:46:09.50
to me and shook my hand thank you thank you for everything that you and you guys you and your

2639
02:46:09.50 --> 02:46:15.98
guys are doing to bring him home really thank you for everything you're doing for all these guys

2640
02:46:17.58 --> 02:46:21.66
you guys come all the way out here and risk your lives to get my buddies out I cannot thank you enough

2641
02:46:21.66 --> 02:46:34.70
for doing this it really means a lot and then kaboon ground shook my heart stopped the ripples of

2642
02:46:34.70 --> 02:46:41.02
concussive shockwave went through my innards uncomfortably tickling my stomach in my anxiety

2643
02:46:41.02 --> 02:46:45.50
shot through the roof everyone got down and took cover behind anything the conservatives protection

2644
02:46:45.50 --> 02:46:49.98
the tank record operator still kept walking on the open road back towards the record

2645
02:46:49.98 --> 02:46:56.38
not at all influenced by the explosion his mind was struck by grief the blast might as well

2646
02:46:56.38 --> 02:47:06.78
been a cool breeze and he looked as if he didn't care there was another ied that blew up on the

2647
02:47:06.78 --> 02:47:14.06
tail end of the perimeter no one got hurt just a little shaken no one could relax but how could we

2648
02:47:14.06 --> 02:47:34.70
every inch of this road could be wired to blow so you guys wrap up that you guys finally have

2649
02:47:34.70 --> 02:47:39.42
everyone and now well there's a situation that unfolds here's the problem staff sergeant we only

2650
02:47:39.42 --> 02:47:43.42
brought enough vehicles to transport my security team out of here we were already out here at the

2651
02:47:43.42 --> 02:47:48.54
scene last night and nobody at higher headquarters told us that they were going to fly you guys

2652
02:47:48.54 --> 02:47:53.50
all the way out here to join us how we didn't even know that you guys what that you guys were

2653
02:47:53.50 --> 02:47:58.86
even going to be here until you showed up at camp correct or we just do not have enough room

2654
02:47:58.86 --> 02:48:04.70
to take the remains and all of you back to base we need to figure out a way to do that we can't

2655
02:48:04.70 --> 02:48:12.06
make two trips so basically you're all out there you got the remains now and there's not enough

2656
02:48:12.06 --> 02:48:19.58
room in the vehicles to get everyone in the vehicles back to camp correct or right and eventually

2657
02:48:19.58 --> 02:48:27.90
you guys come up with a plan yeah they wanted to put the remains on top of the vehicles

2658
02:48:28.78 --> 02:48:34.54
and and I shot that down and I wasn't going to give the satisfaction to the bad guys to

2659
02:48:34.54 --> 02:48:40.14
let them use that as a recruiting tool that you know they just missed up these guys and I didn't

2660
02:48:40.14 --> 02:48:46.78
want them to know how how bad they hurt these guys so I said no no we're not doing it we know we'll

2661
02:48:46.78 --> 02:48:55.42
find another way so we chose another way and then another way well you explained it to your

2662
02:48:55.42 --> 02:48:59.58
guys there is no other choice brother canly and I are going to ride in this Bradley here we're just

2663
02:48:59.58 --> 02:49:04.54
going to have to stack all the body bags and gear on top of us this here is the shit that night

2664
02:49:04.54 --> 02:49:08.86
mirrors are made of and I would never ask you guys to do anything that I wouldn't do myself

2665
02:49:08.86 --> 02:49:13.18
the team just looked at me with wide eyes standing there and looking perplexed for a second

2666
02:49:13.18 --> 02:49:17.10
it was a cardinal rule to never stack the remains and always treat the fallen with the

2667
02:49:17.10 --> 02:49:22.22
utmost respect but the reality of the situation demanded that we do this way there clearly wasn't

2668
02:49:22.22 --> 02:49:29.42
any other choice in a matter we had to get them and us home canly and I climbed in come on let's

2669
02:49:29.42 --> 02:49:34.06
start getting these guys in here and get this shit over with the angels were stacked on top of us

2670
02:49:34.06 --> 02:49:38.30
from Florida ceiling and they're uncomfortable weight crushed my legs causing my feet to fall

2671
02:49:38.30 --> 02:49:44.38
sleep little rips of form little rips had formed in the corners of the black vinyl body bags

2672
02:49:44.38 --> 02:49:49.90
from the difficulty of maneuvering inside the first and now the second Bradley allowing some

2673
02:49:49.90 --> 02:49:57.50
of the viscocities to escape we were ready to go and I couldn't wait to get out of here

2674
02:49:57.50 --> 02:50:10.22
as you guys are driving back you described this we passed a couple of M1 Abrams tanks at an

2675
02:50:10.22 --> 02:50:15.26
intersection they were blocking traffic for us the entire way back to combat outpost

2676
02:50:15.26 --> 02:50:19.58
correct or was guarded by one of the most beautiful sites that I've ever seen a US Army

2677
02:50:19.58 --> 02:50:27.34
platoon of heavy armor taking over this side of the city ensuring our way home holy ship we just might

2678
02:50:27.34 --> 02:50:33.10
make it I looked over at Sergeant Kimley to tell him but he was passed out sleeping I just shook my

2679
02:50:33.10 --> 02:50:39.82
head and disbelief yeah there's some times that when there was a wounded guy or whatever

2680
02:50:40.78 --> 02:50:46.54
the well I know the two two eight would do it and I know that the ready first brigade they would do the

2681
02:50:46.54 --> 02:50:52.14
same thing like they would lock whatever section of the city down to ensure safety I mean you

2682
02:50:52.14 --> 02:50:55.90
can only do it for so long but that's what they do when there was something like this going on

2683
02:50:56.94 --> 02:51:03.02
and it was a very welcome sight to see because we had lost three Bradley's in three weeks

2684
02:51:04.06 --> 02:51:09.74
and you know and now we're taking care of those those guys and getting a moment the whole time

2685
02:51:09.74 --> 02:51:16.46
I'm thinking we're getting it lit up too and yeah when we saw I could look at a little periscope thing

2686
02:51:16.46 --> 02:51:23.34
you know the brief glass and see oh wow they're locking the city down that's awesome you know from

2687
02:51:23.34 --> 02:51:29.58
being all the way you know on the bottom to all of a sudden like wow we just might make it

2688
02:51:29.58 --> 02:51:38.30
we just might not have to be blowing up inside this vehicle yeah people might think that you

2689
02:51:38.30 --> 02:51:44.70
have a feeling of safety and security inside of a tank or Bradley I never felt secure inside of

2690
02:51:44.70 --> 02:51:49.90
a Bradley just don't get tired of it and those you know and I very seldom would ride in the Bradley

2691
02:51:49.90 --> 02:51:54.94
but the army soldiers were riding in there every single day I got handed to those guys and like

2692
02:51:54.94 --> 02:52:00.06
I said every single time they rolled out their rolling past that vehicle graveyard you know you're

2693
02:52:00.06 --> 02:52:08.78
not invincible so I'm gonna jump forward a bit here and again you give great detail yeah I think

2694
02:52:08.78 --> 02:52:14.14
you call that a mystery a second ago of unraddling that first or unraveling that first Bradley

2695
02:52:15.02 --> 02:52:22.38
the missing guy the MIA and you do a great job of going in those details it's a powerful story

2696
02:52:22.38 --> 02:52:32.22
um that you cover I wanted I knew I was maybe their family members or the members of that

2697
02:52:32.22 --> 02:52:37.82
unit would pick this up and would read it now I wanted to know let them to know that

2698
02:52:38.78 --> 02:52:44.46
what how we saw it from our end that we weren't trying to not do our jobs that we were doing

2699
02:52:44.46 --> 02:52:53.18
everything humanly possible to get him home and we just we're exhausted all of our means to do it

2700
02:52:53.18 --> 02:52:59.26
we had no idea until that very last day then then five weeks later we found him

2701
02:53:03.50 --> 02:53:10.22
I'm gonna fast forward a bit back to the book the door swung open and the major promptly

2702
02:53:10.22 --> 02:53:15.26
stood before us he had clearly been upset about something and the stress showed in his eyes and his

2703
02:53:15.26 --> 02:53:22.46
tense stance everyone sit down he was folding his hands into one another and his eyes never made contact

2704
02:53:22.46 --> 02:53:29.50
with any of us I've just gotten some bad news my mind immediately drew up a mental checklist I had

2705
02:53:29.50 --> 02:53:34.30
to figure out exactly what equipment in person know we needed if we had to go on another recovery

2706
02:53:34.30 --> 02:53:38.94
mission outside the wire but this really had to have been something truly special I'd never seen

2707
02:53:38.94 --> 02:53:50.86
the major so visibly shaken today this morning master sergeant angus got killed what I

2708
02:53:50.86 --> 02:53:57.58
mumbled under my breath he was out on a mission he said as he continued looking at the ground

2709
02:53:58.54 --> 02:54:07.58
and they set up a trap for him and his EOD team my worst nightmare had come true I was about to

2710
02:54:07.58 --> 02:54:13.58
process a friend and I was ill prepared in the hundreds of times that I'd rehearsed in my mind

2711
02:54:14.94 --> 02:54:22.86
I'd never thought that it would come to this but it did just a day or two before master sergeant

2712
02:54:22.86 --> 02:54:28.78
angus his whole EOD unit was here to celebrate Thanksgiving with us and he had stood where gate wood was

2713
02:54:28.78 --> 02:54:33.82
now standing chatting with me about trading some of my motel music from my computer

2714
02:54:33.82 --> 02:54:45.18
now the very thought of him being dead seemed surreal sergeant Clinton

2715
02:54:45.82 --> 02:54:50.62
Kinley and sergeant son Sean Johnson show up and I told them what to expect as per the

2716
02:54:50.62 --> 02:54:54.86
information that I had had had sergeant Kinley prepared the SNR packs and ensured that the

2717
02:54:54.86 --> 02:54:59.42
recovery team member and weapon systems were ready to go at a moment's notice sergeant Johnson

2718
02:54:59.42 --> 02:55:04.46
ready the processing room floor and assigned a couple Marines to iron starch and IP the flag

2719
02:55:04.46 --> 02:55:11.26
and preparations for angus his transfer case I called the main armory to set aside an appropriate amount

2720
02:55:11.26 --> 02:55:16.46
of ammunition required for recovery team heading into harm's way and then I prepared myself for

2721
02:55:16.46 --> 02:55:18.22
whichever scenario came first

2722
02:55:21.50 --> 02:55:27.26
seconds turned into minutes minutes into hours and each clock movement thunder does if it was a heavy

2723
02:55:27.26 --> 02:55:36.38
wood door being slammed in a vast chamber the major informers that the EOD team had recovered

2724
02:55:36.38 --> 02:55:46.38
his remains and was en route to our mortuary affairs collection point he advised us to prepare

2725
02:55:46.38 --> 02:55:56.30
ourselves this one was going to be especially messy I went back up to my loft area which

2726
02:55:56.30 --> 02:56:01.34
overlooked the processing room floor changed into my camis and sat down at the computer I still

2727
02:56:01.34 --> 02:56:07.26
had worked to do reports to write I didn't want to seem impacted by this I wanted to be the pillar

2728
02:56:07.26 --> 02:56:13.66
of strength for the others to look upon and be encouraged for the situation ahead but I'm sure

2729
02:56:13.66 --> 02:56:18.94
that my false facade was easily crumbling in front of the armlookers as I sat high in the loft

2730
02:56:18.94 --> 02:56:27.26
for everyone to see I was tired of this shit I took his death personally and the knowledge just

2731
02:56:27.26 --> 02:56:35.34
burned me up from within I just stared blankly at the computer screen the world continued to spin

2732
02:56:35.34 --> 02:56:59.10
and darkness crept into TQ the EOD team arrives and by teams of two the M.A. Marines quickly

2733
02:56:59.10 --> 02:57:03.66
grabbed each end of the body bags placed them on to litters and hurriedly moved his remains into

2734
02:57:03.66 --> 02:57:10.38
the processing room floor I helped grab the last bag out of the humvee and notice that it's

2735
02:57:10.38 --> 02:57:15.26
slashed around the bottom of the compartment which held about two inches of blood

2736
02:57:17.34 --> 02:57:23.02
bag was very heavy and sagged in the middle jagged bones sharpened by the blast protruded

2737
02:57:23.02 --> 02:57:27.90
through the bottom and a trail of blood was left into dusty driveway my heart sank

2738
02:57:27.90 --> 02:57:37.58
we placed him onto the litter stands which each had a thick mound of saw dust below to catch any

2739
02:57:37.58 --> 02:57:44.30
bodily fluids and locked the doors behind us cutting off his unit members and gathering on lookers

2740
02:57:46.22 --> 02:57:49.18
they did not need to see what we had to see every day

2741
02:57:49.18 --> 02:58:07.26
it was our burden to bear not theirs so your team gets started with the processing

2742
02:58:09.42 --> 02:58:14.30
and you go into checking with the major you knock on the door and he says come in

2743
02:58:14.30 --> 02:58:23.18
bussler I opened his door and entered the air change from the cool openness to a sweat laden

2744
02:58:23.18 --> 02:58:29.10
cordite smell a very familiar female EOD surgeon still wearing her ballistics vest and clearly

2745
02:58:29.10 --> 02:58:33.58
in shock from the sudden and devastating loss was sitting in the chair against the wall with her

2746
02:58:33.58 --> 02:58:43.10
shoulders hung and a heavy brow the major sat in front of her leaving over with elbows on his knees

2747
02:58:43.10 --> 02:58:46.70
and his hands clasped together trying awkwardly to console her

2748
02:58:49.90 --> 02:58:56.06
but his attempts were futile I had known her as the Marine martial arts instructor who let

2749
02:58:56.06 --> 02:59:01.58
all the martial arts classes for the EOD team and for the 372nd helicopter squadron

2750
02:59:02.54 --> 02:59:07.50
often they had invited our unit to train and those of us who accepted found that she was a true

2751
02:59:07.50 --> 02:59:13.26
professional and confident leader of Marines she was pure entertainment to watch in martial arts class

2752
02:59:13.26 --> 02:59:18.70
because of her thin short frame yet she took warriors many times her size and introduced such

2753
02:59:18.70 --> 02:59:26.62
searing pain that was simply best described as shutting off all brain function or a neural override

2754
02:59:26.62 --> 02:59:34.22
but here she was wearing the expression of absolute horror beyond any that I'd ever seen before

2755
02:59:34.22 --> 02:59:42.14
the major and I had to get a statement of recognition from her to aid in the tentative identification

2756
02:59:42.14 --> 02:59:51.90
of the master sergeant and doing this made me feel beyond terrible but she had to tell us the

2757
02:59:51.90 --> 03:00:01.50
story of what had happened out there between sobbs she began to relive it all over again her eyes

2758
03:00:01.50 --> 03:00:08.94
flickering as if she were watching a movie that only she could see then she began speaking

2759
03:00:11.26 --> 03:00:15.18
we were out there and found the first IED it looked like a trap from the beginning

2760
03:00:16.14 --> 03:00:22.86
they blew up the robot there wasn't a band in car and the master sergeant volunteered to check it out

2761
03:00:22.86 --> 03:00:33.90
he walked over to where I couldn't see she started crying which subsided into a whimper

2762
03:00:37.42 --> 03:00:45.50
she continued he walked right up and and

2763
03:00:45.50 --> 03:00:58.30
it's okay sergeant what happened I asked that's that's when oh god she started uncontrolled

2764
03:00:58.30 --> 03:01:03.26
we sobbing for a minute then through her tears she conjured up enough strength to continue to

2765
03:01:03.26 --> 03:01:09.02
they called corpsmen up corpsmen up and then dock ran all the way over there from the backside of

2766
03:01:09.02 --> 03:01:14.62
the perimeter he ran up thinking that he could save his life that he was hurt that he was still alive

2767
03:01:14.62 --> 03:01:19.90
we all did we didn't know how bad it was we ran up asking where is he where is he

2768
03:01:21.58 --> 03:01:29.58
they just pointed at all the pieces on the ground she fell back into shock

2769
03:01:30.94 --> 03:01:36.22
and that was all we could get but that was enough information for the statement

2770
03:01:36.22 --> 03:01:46.38
and then after a few minutes when she asked to leave she did by the front doors by the duty hut

2771
03:01:46.38 --> 03:01:50.06
the major and I walked out to the processing floor and witnessed something that to this day I

2772
03:01:50.06 --> 03:01:55.26
would never forget something that has haunted and will always haunt me to the end of my days

2773
03:01:56.70 --> 03:02:01.18
black vinyl bags of nothing but a friend's body parts

2774
03:02:01.18 --> 03:02:11.34
burnt torn bits of camouflage clothing and destroyed gear out of all the deaths that I had

2775
03:02:11.34 --> 03:02:18.06
been surrounded by and all my time over here and in all my tours never had I seen anyone in such

2776
03:02:18.06 --> 03:02:26.38
shape so catastrophically shattered I really think that in that long stare across the floor

2777
03:02:26.38 --> 03:02:34.14
which took maybe only a minute or two I instantly felt myself age in a flash I felt as if all my

2778
03:02:34.14 --> 03:02:38.22
youth and vigor for life had been sacked from me by one horrific scene

2779
03:02:41.26 --> 03:02:47.02
in those hundred twenty seconds I knew that I never wanted to devote myself to such ugly work ever

2780
03:02:47.02 --> 03:02:52.62
again in those hundred twenty seconds I knew that I was sick of death in all of its forms

2781
03:02:52.62 --> 03:03:01.82
and in those hundred twenty seconds I knew I would never ever be the same

2782
03:03:22.62 --> 03:03:45.42
and you know war doesn't stop and four days after Master Sergeant Angus died

2783
03:03:53.58 --> 03:03:59.18
going back to the book the rear door slammed as they entered interrupting the unusual quiet

2784
03:03:59.18 --> 03:04:05.18
and gaining the attention of all of us who called the CP home just as they did over a hundred

2785
03:04:05.18 --> 03:04:12.22
times the team on duty carried in one litter with a large zipped up block black body bag on top

2786
03:04:12.22 --> 03:04:26.38
and then gently lowered him onto the litter stance the processing was moving along I checked

2787
03:04:26.38 --> 03:04:31.74
the penmanship lined by line to see if it was all legible if everything was spelled correctly

2788
03:04:31.74 --> 03:04:36.14
and if they had used capital lettering for each entry as the regs mandated

2789
03:04:36.14 --> 03:04:45.66
okay his name was William D. Richardson okay he was a marine staff sergeant okay

2790
03:04:48.46 --> 03:04:53.90
wait a minute what oh my god did you see what unity was from

2791
03:04:53.90 --> 03:05:06.78
sense of dismay hit me what's up bus something wrong going to gatewood asked leaning over my

2792
03:05:06.78 --> 03:05:11.50
shoulder to see the paperwork that I still had in my hands I handed in the paperwork this is not

2793
03:05:11.50 --> 03:05:16.46
good gunny this is Sergeant Kimley's buddy who's who he was hanging out with just yesterday

2794
03:05:16.46 --> 03:05:25.02
he was in charge on the security detail from the S&R a couple days ago

2795
03:05:34.30 --> 03:05:43.74
you in the book describe you know how you kind of connect the dots and then you realize

2796
03:05:43.74 --> 03:05:49.98
that Kimley's not there at this time and somebody's got to go tell Kimley what had happened

2797
03:05:54.62 --> 03:06:01.74
he was up the whole night before with Richardson going through the draft or action reports

2798
03:06:02.38 --> 03:06:06.38
and we're never catching up on old days you know there was his own platoon sergeant

2799
03:06:06.38 --> 03:06:16.94
and yeah canley knew Doug's wife you know he knew you know it's been all this whole time

2800
03:06:16.94 --> 03:06:24.14
together and didn't even know that each other the two of them were on the same base and then we

2801
03:06:24.14 --> 03:06:28.54
were already associated with the EOD guys there are our buddies they would come over and hang out

2802
03:06:28.54 --> 03:06:36.22
with us we go to their place and until you know after Angus got killed and they hooked up and then

2803
03:06:39.26 --> 03:06:45.90
you know and once I realized who it was you know I had to I had to be the one to tell him because

2804
03:06:47.90 --> 03:06:52.38
if any if any of my buddies got killed over there I would want a friend to come and tell me

2805
03:06:52.38 --> 03:07:01.02
and not just anybody you know hey you know your your buddies did where you know I wanted to be

2806
03:07:01.02 --> 03:07:07.98
there for him and to be there to support him and because I knew it was going to be a huge deal

2807
03:07:09.82 --> 03:07:17.58
our job isn't an easy one and when you realize that your buddies are there

2808
03:07:17.58 --> 03:07:31.98
you know being worked on that takes it to a whole new level yeah so you you're going find them

2809
03:07:35.02 --> 03:07:41.02
and he was supposed to have duty he was supposed to be there on that team

2810
03:07:41.02 --> 03:07:47.74
that morning and since he stayed up the whole night before they just let him sleep

2811
03:07:56.22 --> 03:07:59.82
going back to the book I didn't I didn't know why but I could barely get the words out

2812
03:08:03.26 --> 03:08:06.70
I'm sorry brother I had to be the one to tell you

2813
03:08:06.70 --> 03:08:12.46
but we have your friend Steph Sardre Richardson at the CP

2814
03:08:15.58 --> 03:08:20.54
there was a home V-axe downtown this morning and I am so very sorry brother

2815
03:08:23.02 --> 03:08:23.98
but he didn't make it

2816
03:08:29.90 --> 03:08:34.14
I knew that he had heard me but it was as if his mind refused to accept it

2817
03:08:34.14 --> 03:08:39.90
you could see the thought roll back in his mind and a look of emptiness

2818
03:08:39.90 --> 03:08:46.86
soul you replaced his sleepy expression he squinted as if he was concentrating on a deep thought

2819
03:08:48.14 --> 03:08:51.74
then look down to put a pinch of dip into his lips stood up and said

2820
03:08:51.74 --> 03:09:01.82
okay Steph Sardre and he walks straight out the door on the far end of the building with a blank look

2821
03:09:04.70 --> 03:09:08.78
I wasn't sure how to take his reaction I looked at the gunny and he just shrugged

2822
03:09:08.78 --> 03:09:11.74
we waited several minutes to see if he would come back but he never did

2823
03:09:11.74 --> 03:09:19.50
so we turned out the light and closed the door when we left

2824
03:09:22.06 --> 03:09:29.02
the wind still blows the sand still shifts the stars still fill the sky

2825
03:09:29.02 --> 03:09:41.10
and the world continues to spin even though it may feel as if it has been shattered for your friend

2826
03:09:48.94 --> 03:09:55.90
you um you go into a great section here you know about gimme

2827
03:09:55.90 --> 03:10:09.66
and what that did to him and it's something that everybody should read and it's um

2828
03:10:14.38 --> 03:10:19.74
you know he had reached his limits for that deployment for that deployment he went back

2829
03:10:19.74 --> 03:10:29.50
to three other times afterwards and you guys had to take care of him which is what you did

2830
03:10:29.50 --> 03:10:32.06
right and he took care of him and you did it the right way

2831
03:10:33.74 --> 03:10:37.90
got him the break that he needed and this is something I talk about all the time

2832
03:10:39.18 --> 03:10:46.86
is just like a car if you they check engine light comes on you got it you got to get it off the

2833
03:10:46.86 --> 03:10:53.02
highway you got to get it serviced and if you get it serviced it'll be okay check light engine goes off

2834
03:10:53.02 --> 03:11:00.54
you can take that thing back on the road again if you keep driving it when that check engine light

2835
03:11:00.54 --> 03:11:04.54
comes on and then the temperature gauge comes on and then the oil pressure gauge comes on

2836
03:11:04.54 --> 03:11:07.10
and you keep driving that thing you're going to destroy that vehicle yeah

2837
03:11:09.26 --> 03:11:15.02
and so you guys did the right thing and as you could see he was able to get that check engine

2838
03:11:15.02 --> 03:11:22.54
light fixed get the refit and go back and continue on once again that's America

2839
03:11:27.42 --> 03:11:33.18
he's a hell the guy he was in Felicia, Phantom Fury and he worked at the potato factory there

2840
03:11:33.18 --> 03:11:38.30
where all the remains were coming in he did all the the search recoveries going and they're

2841
03:11:38.30 --> 03:11:44.94
pulling out all the dead insurgents you know and and this is when EOD could not

2842
03:11:46.38 --> 03:11:52.94
fulfill all their commitments and stuff so they were out there with hairpins and put them in grenades

2843
03:11:52.94 --> 03:12:01.34
on your own on their suicide vests to you know make them where they won't blow up and then

2844
03:12:01.34 --> 03:12:09.02
take care and stuff and then you know this here's his second tour of his with us I mean the guy

2845
03:12:10.06 --> 03:12:17.58
is one of the best and I that's that chapter is the strongest man of the youngest and he definitely was

2846
03:12:21.42 --> 03:12:27.82
like I said it's worth reading so that people can understand how all that unfolded

2847
03:12:27.82 --> 03:12:32.86
and and what you guys did what how it affected him how you guys took care of him

2848
03:12:35.66 --> 03:12:43.66
and and obviously the the outcome is positive I guess there's no other way to say it

2849
03:12:43.66 --> 03:12:47.10
because I know it's not a positive situation but the outcome is positive you know you

2850
03:12:47.10 --> 03:12:58.54
use able to continue on go on more deployments continue to do his job going back to the book

2851
03:12:58.54 --> 03:13:04.54
17 weeks at past since our arrival here to teach you and over that course of time I had watched

2852
03:13:04.54 --> 03:13:09.26
our mission here take a toll upon each and every one of us in the platoon our mission of processing

2853
03:13:09.26 --> 03:13:16.46
angels had slowly bled the color out of our lives until the one day when we woke up to find the

2854
03:13:16.46 --> 03:13:23.98
whole world gray there was nothing to look forward to but the slow grind of our work and the end of our

2855
03:13:23.98 --> 03:13:30.46
date the end date of our deployment which still seemed so far away our day to day reality here was

2856
03:13:30.46 --> 03:13:35.82
filled with an ever increasing level of gruesomeness with the opening of each bag just when you

2857
03:13:35.82 --> 03:13:40.54
thought you'd seen it all there would be one more unimaginable horror that would take your breath away

2858
03:13:40.54 --> 03:13:47.82
it was said that there was no tougher duty than this mission and that there was no greater honor

2859
03:13:47.82 --> 03:13:54.62
than more charity affairs duty but there was nothing about this mission that would be motivating

2860
03:13:54.62 --> 03:13:59.82
to any of us because no matter how you looked at it at the end of the day you are putting the

2861
03:13:59.82 --> 03:14:06.46
broken pieces of yet another American hero into another black vinyl bag to be sent home to another

2862
03:14:06.46 --> 03:14:15.74
family who had soon have their world shattered and with each set of remains that we sent home

2863
03:14:18.06 --> 03:14:20.70
a little piece of ourselves went with them

2864
03:14:20.70 --> 03:14:44.94
yeah I mean just a brutal deployment and when it again jump at a headwind it finally comes time

2865
03:14:44.94 --> 03:14:55.42
for you guys to go home you you call this chapter more than ready it felt as if all of this

2866
03:14:56.30 --> 03:15:02.30
had been a dream that this day truly wasn't here and I would soon wake up to find that we were

2867
03:15:02.30 --> 03:15:08.14
still back in September and we would have to redo this whole deployment all over again I was

2868
03:15:08.14 --> 03:15:15.98
miles beyond exhausted both mentally and physically the experiences of the past six months had left

2869
03:15:15.98 --> 03:15:22.94
me battered and defeated and when I looked deep inside myself it felt as if my soul had

2870
03:15:22.94 --> 03:15:31.02
withered and turned gray from being exposed to so many gruesome deaths this had been hands down

2871
03:15:31.02 --> 03:15:43.18
the toughest of all my deployments and now you're getting ready to actually leave and you

2872
03:15:43.18 --> 03:15:47.90
say I threw my sea bags down onto the gym floor that the major had bestowed the name house of pain

2873
03:15:47.90 --> 03:15:54.30
back in September and I had thought that his bravado was misplaced to me this whole place was

2874
03:15:54.30 --> 03:16:01.42
one big house of pain from up here in the loft I had watched the Marines open the black vinyl

2875
03:16:01.42 --> 03:16:06.62
bags of so many fallen heroes the floor of the gym had been our overflow area for a mass

2876
03:16:06.62 --> 03:16:11.58
casualty situation in December the front desk was where I had first met master sergeant

2877
03:16:11.58 --> 03:16:19.66
angus and the processing room floor was where we saw him off our storage area behind the floor

2878
03:16:19.66 --> 03:16:27.10
was where I witnessed the immense weight of our job crushed the strongest man among us and out

2879
03:16:27.10 --> 03:16:33.58
in the reaper was where I touched the blue field and white stars and set a quiet prayer for all

2880
03:16:33.58 --> 03:16:42.78
150 angels who left my custody this building held so many memories that had now been seared into

2881
03:16:42.78 --> 03:16:48.22
this reaper of pathways of my brain and I was a flurry of tangled emotions

2882
03:16:52.06 --> 03:16:55.50
I quietly closed the door behind me as I made my way out

2883
03:16:56.38 --> 03:17:00.94
shutting out the world that would forever haunt me before I climbed aboard the Humvee

2884
03:17:03.74 --> 03:17:08.54
are you ready to go staff sergeant to drive or ask me? I replied

2885
03:17:08.54 --> 03:17:18.70
more than ready brother I heard that he said and just like that we were off the chase

2886
03:17:18.70 --> 03:17:23.50
this on across the sky and to wake up in another world

2887
03:17:23.50 --> 03:17:42.86
and soon thereafter you were getting on an aluminum tube and you were back in the states

2888
03:17:44.30 --> 03:17:48.38
any did they have any decompression for you guys what did you what was your process coming home?

2889
03:17:48.38 --> 03:17:54.70
Get off the back of duty go back to your regular lives there was nothing no gradual time

2890
03:17:54.70 --> 03:18:00.70
you know I let them know that our first sergeant that I wasn't ready you know

2891
03:18:01.50 --> 03:18:04.70
and you guys I don't care by the end of the day you're off my books

2892
03:18:06.38 --> 03:18:15.58
so I went back to delivering mail and then I started having all these problems with PTSD

2893
03:18:15.58 --> 03:18:20.30
I felt like I was always on patrol my mind would click off I would still walk for blocks

2894
03:18:23.02 --> 03:18:30.06
wasn't sleeping everything that that I repressed over there in combat all the remains

2895
03:18:31.10 --> 03:18:35.42
that we had taken care of I had still dream about it and stuff and

2896
03:18:37.90 --> 03:18:43.02
and it took over my life I ended up leaving the post office

2897
03:18:43.02 --> 03:18:50.22
got rated at a hundred percent permit and told with the VA and went to a big deep depression

2898
03:18:52.62 --> 03:18:57.02
I ended up coping with everything by drinking seven days a week because that was the only way

2899
03:18:57.02 --> 03:19:02.86
I knew how to get some sleep and I got lucky because I met the a met

2900
03:19:02.86 --> 03:19:13.34
people who actually cared and wrote me in one of them was my PTSD therapist Bill

2901
03:19:14.22 --> 03:19:19.34
he was over at the VA just to retire out the air force and he was there in Iraq

2902
03:19:19.34 --> 03:19:24.38
with the mental health assessment teams so now finally met somebody that I didn't have to explain

2903
03:19:24.38 --> 03:19:29.74
when I knew he was because he traveled the same roads so he helped me through

2904
03:19:29.74 --> 03:19:34.14
it could be three o'clock in the morning and I could call him it didn't matter

2905
03:19:35.18 --> 03:19:41.90
but what really also helped me is a was a corpsman from Vietnam did two tours over in Vietnam

2906
03:19:42.54 --> 03:19:46.94
and over at the VAFW and when we're on night we're sitting there and we're drinking and stuff

2907
03:19:46.94 --> 03:19:53.42
and we used to have all these big philosophy, philosophical conversations and you go

2908
03:19:53.42 --> 03:19:59.74
you know what I know what you need I'm like what you need to start writing I'm like now

2909
03:20:00.30 --> 03:20:05.98
I'm good man I'm out of writer a barely past high school English so he goes no that is what

2910
03:20:05.98 --> 03:20:13.34
helped me when I was when I came back from Vietnam so period of time goes by and I ended up

2911
03:20:13.34 --> 03:20:19.34
picking it up and said why not oh from a nightmare and said I am not doing anything else why not

2912
03:20:19.34 --> 03:20:24.38
so what I did is I started writing down the stories and my very first one was Angus

2913
03:20:26.94 --> 03:20:33.10
I did what he said I would write it out I would say my goodbyes I would have my little toast to them

2914
03:20:33.10 --> 03:20:39.58
and at the very end I would burn it in a bonfire and in symbolically I gain power over that

2915
03:20:40.14 --> 03:20:46.22
but was a immense weight upon my shoulders now had an America value

2916
03:20:46.22 --> 03:20:55.26
and that experience now was worth 20,000 words and I could change things around and change the

2917
03:20:55.26 --> 03:21:02.86
perspectives and stuff but it gave me a chance to pull out that trauma and pull it out and instead

2918
03:21:02.86 --> 03:21:08.78
of being a big jumble I pulled it out and being able to diagnose it and I started writing and I would take

2919
03:21:08.78 --> 03:21:18.46
those stories into my therapist and years later my wife suggested why not try to publish it

2920
03:21:19.26 --> 03:21:24.06
and so that's what became the book it was started off as just me trying to get a handle

2921
03:21:24.70 --> 03:21:31.34
of all the stuff that we had went through never never ever expecting to publish it and now

2922
03:21:31.34 --> 03:21:38.54
it is what it is now it's the second book to have ever been written about this subject

2923
03:21:39.10 --> 03:21:48.22
about mortuary affairs but the first one that ever dives into the emotional side and how it hits us

2924
03:21:48.22 --> 03:21:57.58
and it connects generation kill to taking chance that whole blank area

2925
03:21:57.58 --> 03:22:09.74
there and it has opened a lot of doors for myself as far as being able to overcome what I thought

2926
03:22:10.14 --> 03:22:20.54
was my weakness and I found it is actually my strength my I have the answers that a lot of

2927
03:22:20.54 --> 03:22:27.98
families, gold star families want to know they want to know how with their son or daughter

2928
03:22:27.98 --> 03:22:38.06
taking care of when they lost her lives and my book stells that that they were surrounded by

2929
03:22:38.06 --> 03:22:44.06
the ones that they loved and who loved them and I wanted them to know that the very last

2930
03:22:44.06 --> 03:22:51.18
hands to touch and in our rack were carrying hands we were the ones willing to die to make sure

2931
03:22:51.18 --> 03:23:03.90
that they got home so yeah this book has become a lot more than just a collection of stories it's

2932
03:23:03.90 --> 03:23:15.26
now providing a by example a way for other guys to find peace if I was able to sit there and write

2933
03:23:15.26 --> 03:23:22.14
maybe somebody else can figure out that they can get their sit there and write and be able to find peace

2934
03:23:22.14 --> 03:23:32.78
after all of this war and multiple deployments and stuff so I'm hoping you know everything will

2935
03:23:32.78 --> 03:23:40.94
other people will pick up on it when you when you go to the therapist that help you what what's

2936
03:23:40.94 --> 03:23:46.14
that process like what are they asking you what are you telling them what are they telling you

2937
03:23:48.06 --> 03:23:55.66
he we would sit down and look at you say how are you doing and I would say I'm having a really

2938
03:23:55.66 --> 03:24:01.26
rough time having slept in three days you know every time I close my eyes I would think about

2939
03:24:01.26 --> 03:24:05.74
this situation and that kind of thing and fighting with the wife again and I can't connect with my

2940
03:24:05.74 --> 03:24:11.74
kids and I feel like that you know my kids are afraid of me and I think and then we just go off into

2941
03:24:13.58 --> 03:24:19.82
from there he would talk about whatever situations that would have happened he had a really good

2942
03:24:19.82 --> 03:24:30.62
way of easing into over there and how they connected I would have I still do have a food

2943
03:24:30.62 --> 03:24:36.30
version just because I don't some sometimes the food reminds me of the stuff that would happen

2944
03:24:36.30 --> 03:24:48.94
over there and and so we would talk about that situation and work through those and when I

2945
03:24:48.94 --> 03:24:55.66
first started going there was seven days a week eventually now it's way to one day whenever I need

2946
03:24:55.66 --> 03:25:00.70
to talk to him but I know that if I was to give him a call three of them morning he's always going to be

2947
03:25:00.70 --> 03:25:10.30
there and I think that's what really is is the key behind other people they need to have that

2948
03:25:10.30 --> 03:25:18.70
family around them of support that you know they had a wife that she never gave up on me she always

2949
03:25:18.70 --> 03:25:27.98
was there to to make sure I was taking my meds and make sure that I had somebody to talk to you

2950
03:25:27.98 --> 03:25:34.78
if I needed to talk to one of the she would call up one of the Marines a bedlack he would come over

2951
03:25:34.78 --> 03:25:41.58
and and I needed somebody to talk to you right thing who was there and so I think it takes more than one

2952
03:25:41.58 --> 03:25:50.70
person to help people get back in their minds you know and so the combination of talking about it

2953
03:25:50.70 --> 03:25:58.62
with therapists and friends and then writing about it getting it out and seeing it and seeing it

2954
03:25:58.62 --> 03:26:05.50
as what you say it was a product like something you could calculate it was 20,000,000,000 but you

2955
03:26:05.50 --> 03:26:12.86
took this pain and transferred it into something that had value that you could look at and then you

2956
03:26:12.86 --> 03:26:17.02
could understand better you articulate it right you start seeing it from a different perspective

2957
03:26:17.02 --> 03:26:20.70
because when you read something that you've written you see it from a different perspective now you

2958
03:26:20.70 --> 03:26:25.34
can understand it better better you understand it the more power you have over it right there's no

2959
03:26:25.34 --> 03:26:31.42
longer await and hold me down and something that would try to avoid thinking about now it's

2960
03:26:31.42 --> 03:26:40.06
something that I was focused on something that it wasn't that wait it was something that means

2961
03:26:40.06 --> 03:26:48.78
something because of this moment I was talking about angus and now I'm bringing this chapter into

2962
03:26:48.78 --> 03:26:55.18
to build and he would say okay let's go over what had happened and we would work on that and then

2963
03:26:55.18 --> 03:27:01.82
I would burn that after I was done with that story and would rewrite it all over again and it was just that

2964
03:27:02.86 --> 03:27:07.74
going over and over and over and over and over that same stuff but I think also what really helped

2965
03:27:07.74 --> 03:27:14.06
me is going on some of these veteran trips that meant me knowing connect with other people

2966
03:27:14.94 --> 03:27:21.98
who who may have different experiences then I did different kind of traumas but we built a little

2967
03:27:21.98 --> 03:27:30.94
network of people and then I finally realized I wasn't alone you know and at the very beginning

2968
03:27:30.94 --> 03:27:40.62
I felt that I was alone that everybody else is still deploying and here I was and I was the broken one

2969
03:27:41.98 --> 03:27:48.54
and I was ashamed of that and and and then after all of this years now I don't look at it I was

2970
03:27:48.54 --> 03:27:58.06
broken I looked at it that I was I just I was injured I you know I can't be put back together I can't

2971
03:27:58.06 --> 03:28:04.54
heal but you have to be patient it's not just flipping the lights and everything will be okay like I

2972
03:28:04.54 --> 03:28:11.98
expected it in the very beginning it's something you have to work on and so after all these years

2973
03:28:11.98 --> 03:28:20.62
of after I published it now I'm in I'm back in school becoming a electrical lineman something

2974
03:28:20.62 --> 03:28:30.78
when I thought my life was over and I'll never be you know that husband that father that man

2975
03:28:31.34 --> 03:28:39.02
and now I am reinventing myself and it's through you know people who love me and you know and

2976
03:28:39.02 --> 03:28:46.54
people that have met and they've always been there for me and and going through the book and pulling

2977
03:28:46.54 --> 03:28:53.02
out that jumble of experiences and pulling it out like a thread and being able to work on that

2978
03:28:53.82 --> 03:29:02.46
and it has really opened up my future yeah it's very very very fortunate

2979
03:29:02.46 --> 03:29:09.90
yeah the the idea of having a new mission it's again something that I talk about a lot and as

2980
03:29:09.90 --> 03:29:17.42
soon as you said you would what how did you terminate at them at the postal service did you quit

2981
03:29:17.42 --> 03:29:23.58
did you win so as soon as I heard that I'm like you yeah because well a you know it's like okay

2982
03:29:23.58 --> 03:29:27.26
at least you have to do something but if it's not something you care about then it's not in

2983
03:29:27.26 --> 03:29:32.62
me help anyways but you know as soon as you said I'm going back to school and become alignment I'm like yes

2984
03:29:33.66 --> 03:29:45.74
and you know I needed that break I needed to focus on me I looked at going to therapy as my job

2985
03:29:45.74 --> 03:29:52.38
my full time job and I needed to do it because I want to be the best father I can't be for my

2986
03:29:52.38 --> 03:30:00.94
kids how to be the best husband I can be for my life you know and I wanted to not be a sad story

2987
03:30:02.54 --> 03:30:09.50
I wanted to be able to get back into living again not just being trapped inside my own four walls

2988
03:30:10.46 --> 03:30:17.50
so through the book and through therapy and at the end of the book I'm thanking all the people

2989
03:30:17.50 --> 03:30:24.78
that really you know sacrifice their time because they thought I was worth it you know

2990
03:30:26.14 --> 03:30:41.98
when did you lose your dad 20 11 February of 2011 we would we would we would go in the work just

2991
03:30:41.98 --> 03:30:49.82
like how we did before the war started we would you know I would pick him up we would go in

2992
03:30:50.70 --> 03:30:56.22
one just days I would drive over to his place and then he would drive and he had always catch me

2993
03:30:56.22 --> 03:31:03.10
staring off into nothing we would meet for lunch and I wouldn't say a thing my mind was still over there

2994
03:31:03.10 --> 03:31:14.22
and he was always hey you know I could talk you know if you want to talk about you know I didn't

2995
03:31:14.22 --> 03:31:23.82
see anything that you like you saw but I'm I'm always here and so when I started writing was

2996
03:31:23.82 --> 03:31:29.66
after he passed about a year after he passed and I think that you need to have somebody that you're

2997
03:31:29.66 --> 03:31:37.50
writing to and that's what helped me get out of my shell about writing was I was writing it as if I was

2998
03:31:37.50 --> 03:31:52.78
writing it telling him about all the things that he wanted to know so you you you talk about that and

2999
03:31:52.78 --> 03:32:01.98
well it's worth closing out here you say in the end of the book for years and years I have

3000
03:32:01.98 --> 03:32:08.06
struggled hard with post traumatic stress and I've been through the gamut of self medication

3001
03:32:08.06 --> 03:32:15.10
contemplation of suicide survivors guilt sleepless nights hypervisulance flashbacks and

3002
03:32:15.10 --> 03:32:21.58
night tears but it was the open hearts and kindness of the strangers and friends that helped my mind

3003
03:32:21.58 --> 03:32:29.74
returned from the battlefield long after my body had found home it was the friendly faces of bill,

3004
03:32:29.74 --> 03:32:37.82
Janine and Bonnie at the VA it was the open year of my neighbor Chris it was Derek and the richy

3005
03:32:37.82 --> 03:32:47.82
boys in mobile Alabama and also Ray, Bobby and Tom in Jackson Hole Wyoming Chris, Brenda and Josh

3006
03:32:47.82 --> 03:32:54.78
up in Delta, Wisconsin Lisa with the Semper Fife Fund Bill and Dave with Operation Healing Waters,

3007
03:32:54.78 --> 03:33:01.26
Don and Diane and Cambridge Maryland, Mo Mike Luke Ashley with three gun four vets

3008
03:33:03.42 --> 03:33:08.06
Larry drawn, I'm saying that right, Larry drawn junior Larry drawn junior for teaching me

3009
03:33:09.90 --> 03:33:14.70
that there is no such thing as giving up even if you had lost your legs now Afghanistan

3010
03:33:14.70 --> 03:33:24.46
yeah my wife Wendy for always believing in me even when I gave up on myself and last but not least

3011
03:33:25.26 --> 03:33:34.78
my dad Larry Bustler I wish you were still here to see this day dad I still remember you

3012
03:33:34.78 --> 03:33:38.86
ask me what I was thinking about all those times that you caught me staring off into never never land

3013
03:33:38.86 --> 03:33:45.98
I told you nothing because I didn't want to talk about it and you would laugh and tell me

3014
03:33:47.26 --> 03:33:50.70
when you are ready to tell me I'll be here

3015
03:33:55.50 --> 03:33:58.78
well dad I wrote down all the stories that you wanted to know

3016
03:33:58.78 --> 03:34:04.94
I just wish you were still here to read them

3017
03:34:18.86 --> 03:34:20.06
and I also want to just

3018
03:34:20.06 --> 03:34:26.70
you know you you have the book dedication here

3019
03:34:28.78 --> 03:34:33.98
it says this book is dedicated to those who had shed their life's blood and defensive

3020
03:34:33.98 --> 03:34:46.62
carnation to those loved ones who went for them and to those who ensured that they were

3021
03:34:46.62 --> 03:34:49.90
returned home with honor

3022
03:34:49.90 --> 03:35:07.02
so you know as much as I

3023
03:35:07.02 --> 03:35:17.10
I think as much as I talk about the immense cost of war

3024
03:35:17.82 --> 03:35:29.98
there's really just no way to capture and describe and properly communicate the impact that war has

3025
03:35:29.98 --> 03:35:37.98
and I think one thing that

3026
03:35:39.50 --> 03:35:45.50
one thing that we have to do is we have to make sure that it's not only a negative impact

3027
03:35:45.50 --> 03:36:00.46
it's up to us it's up to us to ensure that those sacrifices, those

3028
03:36:00.46 --> 03:36:14.78
in calculable sacrifices by the fallen, by their families

3029
03:36:16.06 --> 03:36:21.10
we got to make sure that those sacrifices were not made in vain and we do that by living our lives

3030
03:36:22.46 --> 03:36:23.50
to the fullest

3031
03:36:23.50 --> 03:36:33.66
every second, every minute, every day, four those heroes

3032
03:36:33.66 --> 03:36:46.30
make your life count

3033
03:36:46.30 --> 03:36:59.90
this book will absolutely give you an appreciation

3034
03:37:02.22 --> 03:37:07.34
it gives you a glimpse into these

3035
03:37:09.10 --> 03:37:13.66
from it gives you a glimpse in the war, give you a glimpse into these sacrifices and as I said at the

3036
03:37:13.66 --> 03:37:16.94
beginning of this the sacrifices aren't they don't end on the battlefield

3037
03:37:18.62 --> 03:37:23.18
in many ways they start on the battlefield because the families have to carry on

3038
03:37:23.18 --> 03:37:39.10
and like I said this book will remind you of what you got

3039
03:37:44.86 --> 03:37:47.18
you got a website called notufferduty

3040
03:37:47.18 --> 03:37:57.74
no tufferduty.com you're on Twitter, Facebook, Twitter is no tougher duty, Facebook is no

3041
03:37:57.74 --> 03:38:05.58

3042
03:38:05.58 --> 03:38:16.86

3043
03:38:17.42 --> 03:38:21.58

3044
03:38:23.34 --> 03:38:23.98
with a nightmare

3045
03:38:24.86 --> 03:38:29.58
and it's not just me it's it's a whole bunch of other people who sacrifice their lives

3046
03:38:29.58 --> 03:38:37.42

3077
03:42:21.50 --> 03:42:25.26
gone through it's a story that if you don't know it you don't know it and that's a problem

3078
03:42:26.94 --> 03:42:33.90
so many incredible sacrifices so thank you for coming thank you for writing the book and most of all

3079
03:42:35.10 --> 03:42:40.70
thanks for your service and your sacrifice and to close this out of course

3080
03:42:40.70 --> 03:42:51.82
separate for Dallas brother separate five and with that gunny L Christian busler

3081
03:42:53.42 --> 03:43:09.34
Chris Bustler has left the building and heavy very heavy subject time for a little decompression

3082
03:43:09.34 --> 03:43:18.78
which you're in charge of echo tross just proceed down the path of decompression for that

3083
03:43:18.78 --> 03:43:25.98
though all right so one of the many parts that stood out that kind of made me think about even more

3084
03:43:25.98 --> 03:43:32.06
was the you know when when he talked about okay he called it the bussler method right of putting the flag

3085
03:43:32.06 --> 03:43:36.94
you know so he would iron on right iron the flag so there's none of those those wrinkles like

3086
03:43:36.94 --> 03:43:43.42
the new shirt wrinkles you know that right and that makes sense because you know when like

3087
03:43:43.42 --> 03:43:48.06
let's say you see someone like with a new t-shirt on and they have those wrinkles it's kind of like you can

3088
03:43:48.06 --> 03:43:53.66
almost see like the product it's a product on him you know product it gets packaged and

3089
03:43:53.66 --> 03:43:58.30
shipped and it's this product it's not like part of the I don't know whatever the other

3090
03:43:58.30 --> 03:44:02.94
in a t-shirt scenario I don't know what the other feeling would be but it seems more like

3091
03:44:02.94 --> 03:44:08.62
it's deliberately costum it's foreign if it's if it's brand new it's creases it kind of looks

3092
03:44:08.62 --> 03:44:15.18
foreign yeah foreign to the to the human that's wearing it yeah you see me wearing a brand new

3093
03:44:15.18 --> 03:44:19.02
t-shirt with creases in it you're kind of like oh this is not really part of him right right

3094
03:44:19.02 --> 03:44:23.50
not part of exactly right it doesn't match exactly exactly right that's what I'm saying so the

3095
03:44:23.50 --> 03:44:29.58
so the the creased or folded creases in the flags that that have been packaged how he said

3096
03:44:29.58 --> 03:44:34.46
out of a box or something like that that feeling is really prevalent when you see the creases

3097
03:44:34.46 --> 03:44:39.02
and something it's kind of like oh yeah it's just this packaged product now that you're throwing

3098
03:44:39.02 --> 03:44:47.18
on this you know this very heavy and intense and special scenario you can say so that made sense

3099
03:44:47.18 --> 03:44:50.86
I mean a lot of sense actually and then you can kind of imagine the difference you know especially

3100
03:44:50.86 --> 03:44:55.98
when he was talking about the guy who saw that he saw one and he saw another one then he saw the

3101
03:44:55.98 --> 03:45:00.54
real one or the real deal and he was like man I need them all to be like that that makes sense to

3102
03:45:00.54 --> 03:45:06.06
me yeah for sure that he would think that's a huge deal you would feel it that way no it's so

3103
03:45:06.06 --> 03:45:14.78
it's important for sure for sure heavy very much so also yeah okay so what are we doing

3104
03:45:14.78 --> 03:45:23.82
improving ourselves yes fitness jiu jitsu work family those are four things I think you know that maybe

3105
03:45:23.82 --> 03:45:31.34
it would take a lot you have another one in there too no no you're thinking of the eight pillars

3106
03:45:31.34 --> 03:45:37.26
I had seven and you added one eight that's different okay have we discussed those yes no

3107
03:45:37.26 --> 03:45:46.46
not on here yeah what one did I add um it was essentially I forget what name we arrived at

3108
03:45:46.46 --> 03:45:54.62
but it was like the basically the spirituality element of it wow I gave you that yeah and what did

3109
03:45:54.62 --> 03:46:02.06
that mean what did that mean um like so they're all in pairs I don't think we should go too deep into it

3110
03:46:02.06 --> 03:46:08.62
but they're all in pairs so there's you know what let's do grounded podcast on it okay so

3111
03:46:09.26 --> 03:46:13.74
we'll do a grounded podcast because I'm real curious how I got to spirituality that's yeah

3112
03:46:13.74 --> 03:46:17.74
sort of fits perfect maybe that's not even the right word for it but it fits for what was what

3113
03:46:17.74 --> 03:46:28.14
did the spirituality part mean just explain that it meant did it mean doing good for other people yeah

3114
03:46:28.14 --> 03:46:34.78
it was along those lines because I could see you saying because I believe you you get more when you

3115
03:46:34.78 --> 03:46:43.34
give more right like that's kind of my uh not a secret but that's something that I know is true for me

3116
03:46:43.34 --> 03:46:49.18
right if I help someone it makes me I get more out of that than it helped myself yeah so it was

3117
03:46:49.18 --> 03:46:54.38
it's more about the getting more like to to basically improve the quality of your own being

3118
03:46:54.38 --> 03:46:59.66
kind of thing with whether it be giving others more or being in touch with like your temperer

3119
03:46:59.66 --> 03:47:04.14
and like it's basically like who you're on the inside kind of thing like well these are really

3120
03:47:04.14 --> 03:47:08.14
weird things from me yeah that's very strange like what I've said well I've said

3121
03:47:08.14 --> 03:47:13.18
the cover is on grounded yeah it goes the anyway the foot which is different that was the April is

3122
03:47:13.18 --> 03:47:20.70
this is just the four areas of functionality that I was focused on at one point and

3123
03:47:20.70 --> 03:47:24.70
may or may not be still anyway okay so there you are there's one time someone was asking me something

3124
03:47:24.70 --> 03:47:28.30
and I was saying well it's it's easy to simplify your life when you only care about four things

3125
03:47:28.30 --> 03:47:33.42
right and it was those four things and they are fitness fitness health fitness that kind of

3126
03:47:33.42 --> 03:47:38.30
functionality capability blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

3127
03:47:38.30 --> 03:47:43.50
just use one of its own yes it's different okay cool work in family work and family yes okay

3128
03:47:44.14 --> 03:47:48.46
that's legit anyway that was my answer to the lot more to it and last what's cool is

3129
03:47:48.46 --> 03:47:54.78
jiu jitsu will help you with all of them right even though jiu jitsu is its own category yeah

3130
03:47:54.78 --> 03:48:00.94
it will also help your fitness it will help your family and it will help your work yes and technically

3131
03:48:00.94 --> 03:48:06.78
kind of again we could go deep into it if we allow ourselves to but they all improve the

3132
03:48:06.78 --> 03:48:12.86
one of the true also true what's the base of the of the our can't say pyramid because it's

3133
03:48:12.86 --> 03:48:19.74
got four but what's the base of the square jiu jitsu I think they rotate you know because they're

3134
03:48:19.74 --> 03:48:24.94
flexible they're all flexible to create this one unit if you will nonetheless you did mention

3135
03:48:24.94 --> 03:48:30.62
I said jitsu so when we're doing jiu jitsu what do we need a key if you're doing key if you're doing no key

3136
03:48:30.62 --> 03:48:36.14
need a rash cart should need a rash cart yeah I think they're good rash cart is a good

3137
03:48:37.18 --> 03:48:40.14
where we're gonna get that we're gonna get them from origin because origin factually has the

3138
03:48:40.14 --> 03:48:47.66
best keys and they happen to be made in America from the fabric all the way up to the end

3139
03:48:48.54 --> 03:48:52.22
product well we don't have to say we're not even product yet it's a um

3140
03:48:52.22 --> 03:48:58.70
and don't look at me bro come on look at me for a point you walked down the valley

3172
03:52:33.42 --> 03:52:39.98
anybody lie to you on the internet no never ever okay there's some people that like I think they're

3173
03:52:39.98 --> 03:52:47.10
meaning to be cool but they'll ask me a question after telling me something like hey listen you

3174
03:52:47.10 --> 03:52:52.46
all the time is there a list somewhere where you have your books and I'm always like yep

3175
03:52:52.46 --> 03:52:57.74
it's a jokwai podcast dot com go to books and I'm always thinking you had that really not be

3176
03:52:57.74 --> 03:53:03.82
paying attention for a long time if you're in the game if you don't know that I mean people just

3177
03:53:03.82 --> 03:53:08.86
ask me some just just questions that I get asked thousands of times yeah and they and they'll

3178
03:53:08.86 --> 03:53:15.42
ask it and be like but which I don't mind but if they try and front load it with the fact that they're

3179
03:53:15.42 --> 03:53:25.58
like hey yeah really love your podcast okay if you love the podcast then you know that I've written

3180
03:53:25.58 --> 03:53:30.86
kids books right you know you don't say hey you really love your podcast it'd be great if you could

3181
03:53:30.86 --> 03:53:38.22
do something for a kids book right yeah I mean I just yeah it just happens I don't know I guess

3182
03:53:38.22 --> 03:53:42.30
that's not lying maybe they're just trying to be nice I'll tell you what it is okay I'll

3183
03:53:42.30 --> 03:53:46.94
I'll imagine it's a spectrum I would imagine I don't know but it seems like it is where you

3184
03:53:46.94 --> 03:53:53.90
got some people were just blatantly like kind of lying go like hey I I love your podcast or

3185
03:53:53.90 --> 03:53:59.98
maybe they do love it but when they say I listen to all your podcasts and love and love it you know

3186
03:53:59.98 --> 03:54:03.82
like maybe that kind of thing that technically is not true because you don't listen to all the

3187
03:54:03.82 --> 03:54:08.70
even if you did listen to all the podcasts you're kind of misleading if you did listen to all the

3188
03:54:08.70 --> 03:54:12.22
podcast but you didn't listen to the whole thing of all the podcast because it's you did listen to

3189
03:54:12.22 --> 03:54:16.54
here's the the support kick in their shop now they're not listening here to this right now

3190
03:54:16.54 --> 03:54:19.82
and then maybe you know they're violating and that makes sense you know because they're like hey

3191
03:54:19.82 --> 03:54:24.30
podcasts over when to this support mode is listed on the things it's like boom next up but done I

3192
03:54:24.30 --> 03:54:25.74
get it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you're moving on

3193
03:54:25.74 --> 03:54:31.50
makes sense you know what is a lot of it actually yeah so you technically miss like a what percentage

3194
03:54:31.50 --> 03:54:38.22
of people do you think they're done after they hear echo tell us about whatever and then you're

3195
03:54:38.22 --> 03:54:44.22
a lot then they're like click don't know what's for there might be in my perspective it's possible

3196
03:54:44.22 --> 03:54:47.54
It's for his possibilities, go.

3197
03:54:47.54 --> 03:54:48.74
That is pretty high.

3198
03:54:48.74 --> 03:54:55.62
I actually beg to differ because there's so many people that say, first of all, there's

3199
03:54:55.62 --> 03:54:59.78
people that have straight upset, I listen to the podcast for the supports.

3200
03:54:59.78 --> 03:55:02.98
Now of course, there's being a little bit sarcastic, but that's still a statement.

3201
03:55:02.98 --> 03:55:04.30
It's not nothing.

3202
03:55:04.30 --> 03:55:05.30
Right?

3203
03:55:05.30 --> 03:55:12.74
And then there's plenty of people that say the only advertisements that I listen to are,

3204
03:55:12.74 --> 03:55:14.06
you know, when you and Echo do it.

3205
03:55:14.06 --> 03:55:17.50
And what first of all, I say, what's not really an, is this considered an advertisement?

3206
03:55:17.50 --> 03:55:21.74
Yeah, you know, I mean, as far as definitions go, yeah, sure.

3207
03:55:21.74 --> 03:55:22.74
Maybe, I don't know.

3208
03:55:22.74 --> 03:55:23.74
I don't know.

3209
03:55:23.74 --> 03:55:24.74
Okay.

3210
03:55:24.74 --> 03:55:25.74
But okay.

3211
03:55:25.74 --> 03:55:26.90
That makes sense because I have heard that.

3212
03:55:26.90 --> 03:55:31.70
So I'm thinking that more people than you think.

3213
03:55:31.70 --> 03:55:34.78
I think people are listening right now.

3214
03:55:34.78 --> 03:55:35.78
About to click.

3215
03:55:35.78 --> 03:55:41.94
Anyway, so yes, we did, we got the book on Docopotcast for those who may not have

3216
03:55:41.94 --> 03:55:42.94
been on before.

3217
03:55:42.94 --> 03:55:46.10
Got them all listed by episode.

3218
03:55:46.10 --> 03:55:48.50
Also, chocolate store, it's called Jockel Store.

3219
03:55:48.50 --> 03:55:58.10
And this is where you can get T-shirts, rashcards, hoodies, hats, tank tops, merch, as it were.

3220
03:55:58.10 --> 03:55:59.94
That's representative of the path.

3221
03:55:59.94 --> 03:56:01.22
Disbelinicals read them.

3222
03:56:01.22 --> 03:56:01.22
Good.

3223
03:56:01.22 --> 03:56:05.82
Stand by the get some.

3224
03:56:05.82 --> 03:56:07.82
Get out, you know, all these victory MMA in fitness.

3225
03:56:07.82 --> 03:56:10.26
Victory MMA is the reason to represent school.

3226
03:56:10.26 --> 03:56:11.26
Oh, yeah.

3227
03:56:11.26 --> 03:56:11.90
Big time.

3228
03:56:11.90 --> 03:56:15.10
There's people that roll out deep with victory MMA in fitness t-shirts.

3229
03:56:15.10 --> 03:56:16.10
Oh, yeah.

3230
03:56:16.10 --> 03:56:17.10
I see him in Ohio.

3231
03:56:17.10 --> 03:56:18.10
I'm like you.

3232
03:56:18.10 --> 03:56:21.10
You know, represent just straight up in the game.

3233
03:56:21.10 --> 03:56:22.10
It's good.

3234
03:56:22.10 --> 03:56:24.10
But yeah, Jockel Store.com.

3235
03:56:24.10 --> 03:56:26.74
What about that Jockel white T-shirt?

3236
03:56:26.74 --> 03:56:27.74
What about it?

3237
03:56:27.74 --> 03:56:28.74
Is that on there?

3238
03:56:28.74 --> 03:56:29.74
Yeah.

3239
03:56:29.74 --> 03:56:31.74
Because that's how does a gop T-shirt?

3240
03:56:31.74 --> 03:56:32.74
Yeah.

3241
03:56:32.74 --> 03:56:35.02
That's like, it's like your deep in the school.

3242
03:56:35.02 --> 03:56:39.82
You know, when you were a kid and you'd see like a cereal box, it just has the thing on

3243
03:56:39.82 --> 03:56:40.82
it.

3244
03:56:40.82 --> 03:56:43.42
And you're like, dude, no creativity whatsoever.

3245
03:56:43.42 --> 03:56:45.02
That's the Jockel white T-shirt.

3246
03:56:45.02 --> 03:56:47.02
It's just the can.

3247
03:56:47.02 --> 03:56:48.02
It's legit.

3248
03:56:48.02 --> 03:56:52.46
Yeah, but those, those kinds of shirts are legit.

3249
03:56:52.46 --> 03:56:53.86
Like, remember the old school like Pepsi?

3250
03:56:53.86 --> 03:56:57.26
Yeah, because otherwise basically you're trying really hard, right?

3251
03:56:57.26 --> 03:57:00.50
Yeah, he made a Jockel white T-shirt design.

3252
03:57:00.50 --> 03:57:01.50
Right.

3253
03:57:01.50 --> 03:57:02.34
I don't have like a T.

3254
03:57:02.34 --> 03:57:04.90
Well, leave that stuff being wrong.

3255
03:57:04.90 --> 03:57:05.90
The creative.

3256
03:57:05.90 --> 03:57:06.90
He's the creative.

3257
03:57:06.90 --> 03:57:07.90
He's a creative.

3258
03:57:07.90 --> 03:57:08.90
He's what it is.

3259
03:57:08.90 --> 03:57:09.90
We don't know what that is.

3260
03:57:09.90 --> 03:57:11.46
But we know that we're not it.

3261
03:57:11.46 --> 03:57:12.46
Yeah.

3262
03:57:12.46 --> 03:57:14.46
All right.

3263
03:57:14.46 --> 03:57:15.46
Yes.

3264
03:57:15.46 --> 03:57:16.46
So yes, Jockel story.com.

3265
03:57:16.46 --> 03:57:17.46
Let's read Get This.

3266
03:57:17.46 --> 03:57:21.98
Don't forget to a speaking of this podcast, which you may or may not be listening to.

3267
03:57:21.98 --> 03:57:24.98
We're leaning towards not probably not listening to it anymore.

3268
03:57:24.98 --> 03:57:25.98
We're just fine.

3269
03:57:25.98 --> 03:57:29.98
If you are still listening to it, you probably have subscribed so that 1% of people that

3270
03:57:29.98 --> 03:57:34.26
aren't that are listening right now that still haven't subscribed, you could do that

3271
03:57:34.26 --> 03:57:38.10
because for some reason that's on this piece of paper that I wrote.

3272
03:57:38.10 --> 03:57:39.10
Yes.

3273
03:57:39.10 --> 03:57:44.58
And for review, which is funny, you can leave a review that serious or whatever, but

3274
03:57:44.58 --> 03:57:46.78
why that's not a good interaction with me.

3275
03:57:46.78 --> 03:57:48.54
If you say, hey, it's a good podcast.

3276
03:57:48.54 --> 03:57:50.94
I like the information that they put out.

3277
03:57:50.94 --> 03:57:54.86
This will do nothing for me, for echo, for anyone that reads it.

3278
03:57:54.86 --> 03:58:07.74
If you say this podcast is the only podcast that has support advertisements that are of more

3279
03:58:07.74 --> 03:58:10.58
value than the entire podcast itself.

3280
03:58:10.58 --> 03:58:14.74
If you say it's echo just laughed, I laughed a little bit, whoever reads that will be like,

3281
03:58:14.74 --> 03:58:17.46
oh, what does that, what that's all about?

3282
03:58:17.46 --> 03:58:25.50
So subscribe to the podcast and then leave a review that will entertain us.

3283
03:58:25.50 --> 03:58:32.18
And by us, I mean, everyone, not just us to idiots sitting here talking, but everyone

3284
03:58:32.18 --> 03:58:33.18
else that's listening.

3285
03:58:33.18 --> 03:58:34.18
That's true.

3286
03:58:34.18 --> 03:58:35.18
I agree with that notion.

3287
03:58:35.18 --> 03:58:38.30
Also grounded podcast, speaking of podcast, ground a podcast.

3288
03:58:38.30 --> 03:58:43.46
And apparently now we owe a grounded podcast about the four focuses of life and then the

3289
03:58:43.46 --> 03:58:45.74
eight pillars of justice.

3290
03:58:45.74 --> 03:58:46.74
Yes.

3291
03:58:46.74 --> 03:58:47.74
Well, they're pillars of life.

3292
03:58:47.74 --> 03:58:48.74
Yeah, justice.

3293
03:58:48.74 --> 03:58:49.74
Sure.

3294
03:58:49.74 --> 03:58:50.74
Yes.

3295
03:58:50.74 --> 03:58:51.74
So that one will, that would be what?

3296
03:58:51.74 --> 03:58:53.78
If there's seven out now, one losing.

3297
03:58:53.78 --> 03:58:56.14
Number two, cruising.

3298
03:58:56.14 --> 03:58:57.14
No, man.

3299
03:58:57.14 --> 03:58:59.14
Brother, make sense.

3300
03:58:59.14 --> 03:59:00.14
Okay.

3301
03:59:00.14 --> 03:59:03.50
Anyway, grounded podcast, got a new episode out.

3302
03:59:03.50 --> 03:59:08.78
We will focus on making them more consistently with no problems.

3303
03:59:08.78 --> 03:59:09.78
We will.

3304
03:59:09.78 --> 03:59:13.82
Don't forget about the warrior kid podcast.

3305
03:59:13.82 --> 03:59:15.86
Try making some more of those as well.

3306
03:59:15.86 --> 03:59:16.86
Yes.

3307
03:59:16.86 --> 03:59:21.70
And then with a warrior kid podcast, don't forget about the warrior kid himself, Aiden, who's

3308
03:59:21.70 --> 03:59:25.14
making killer soap.

3309
03:59:25.14 --> 03:59:26.14
Oh, yeah.

3310
03:59:26.14 --> 03:59:27.14
That's actually what it's called.

3311
03:59:27.14 --> 03:59:28.14
Have you used it?

3312
03:59:28.14 --> 03:59:29.14
No.

3313
03:59:29.14 --> 03:59:30.14
It's legit.

3314
03:59:30.14 --> 03:59:31.14
It's like, it's funny.

3315
03:59:31.14 --> 03:59:36.10
Every time I get like a, you know, one from them, part of me doesn't want to use it.

3316
03:59:36.10 --> 03:59:39.90
I kind of like, I'm saving one bar and now I'm going to open it and use it.

3317
03:59:39.90 --> 03:59:40.90
Yeah.

3318
03:59:40.90 --> 03:59:41.90
Yeah.

3319
03:59:41.90 --> 03:59:43.18
Once you use it, and we've got that on the website.

3320
03:59:43.18 --> 03:59:44.18
Yeah.

3321
03:59:44.18 --> 03:59:45.18
Yeah.

3322
03:59:45.18 --> 03:59:46.50
The Joggle store of website is where are we?

3323
03:59:46.50 --> 03:59:47.90
We're finalizing it.

3324
03:59:47.90 --> 03:59:49.90
Will we be finalized by next week?

3325
03:59:49.90 --> 03:59:51.22
Oh, as far as deadlines.

3326
03:59:51.22 --> 03:59:53.22
You know, I know you're not really.

3327
03:59:53.22 --> 03:59:54.22
I'm free.

3328
03:59:54.22 --> 03:59:55.22
She's a great.

3329
03:59:55.22 --> 03:59:56.22
I'm a bedline.

3330
03:59:56.22 --> 03:59:57.22
Finalizing now.

3331
03:59:57.22 --> 03:59:58.62
How about this?

3332
03:59:58.62 --> 03:59:59.62
Soon.

3333
03:59:59.62 --> 04:00:01.62
There you go.

3334
04:00:01.62 --> 04:00:03.66
It really boxed yourself in on that one.

3335
04:00:03.66 --> 04:00:07.26
Yes, I'm going to put it on Joggle store now.

3336
04:00:07.26 --> 04:00:09.86
Until then, Irish Oaks Ranch.com.

3337
04:00:09.86 --> 04:00:12.02
Get some soap and.

3338
04:00:12.02 --> 04:00:13.42
Stay clean.

3339
04:00:13.42 --> 04:00:14.70
Yes, sir.

3340
04:00:14.70 --> 04:00:19.26
Also have a YouTube channel for the video version of the podcast and excerpts.

3341
04:00:19.26 --> 04:00:22.86
Except if you don't want to listen to you three, four or five hours of a podcast and you

3342
04:00:22.86 --> 04:00:25.70
know, at a specific time or whatever, you listen to the excerpts.

3343
04:00:25.70 --> 04:00:26.86
Lesson take the lesson with you.

3344
04:00:26.86 --> 04:00:27.86
Share it with somebody.

3345
04:00:27.86 --> 04:00:28.86
Boom.

3346
04:00:28.86 --> 04:00:30.86
YouTube also enhance videos.

3347
04:00:30.86 --> 04:00:32.58
Put some music on there.

3348
04:00:32.58 --> 04:00:33.58
Green screen.

3349
04:00:33.58 --> 04:00:34.58
And.

3350
04:00:34.58 --> 04:00:35.58
CGI.

3351
04:00:35.58 --> 04:00:36.58
Sir.

3352
04:00:36.58 --> 04:00:41.22
Did you just learn that green screen thing?

3353
04:00:41.22 --> 04:00:44.22
Because it kind of seems like you just learned it.

3354
04:00:44.22 --> 04:00:45.22
Yeah, kind of.

3355
04:00:45.22 --> 04:00:46.22
All right.

3356
04:00:46.22 --> 04:00:47.42
Psychological warfare.

3357
04:00:47.42 --> 04:00:49.86
If you need a psychological.

3358
04:00:49.86 --> 04:01:00.90
Yeah, it.

3359
04:01:00.90 --> 04:00:59.18
To propel you over a obstacle, a mental obstacle, even a physical obstacle.

3360
04:00:59.18 --> 04:01:00.58
Hit psychological warfare.

3361
04:01:00.58 --> 04:01:03.78
To put that dough not down.

3362
04:01:03.78 --> 04:01:12.30
And then we also have flip side canvas, which is a visual representation of discipline.

3363
04:01:12.30 --> 04:01:13.94
That's run by Dakota Meyer.

3364
04:01:13.94 --> 04:01:15.22
So check that out.

3365
04:01:15.22 --> 04:01:18.10
If you want to hang something up on your wall.

3366
04:01:18.10 --> 04:01:22.82
For books, we got no tougher duty that which we just went through.

3367
04:01:22.82 --> 04:01:24.38
Go get it.

3368
04:01:24.38 --> 04:01:25.66
Chris Bustler, you just heard him.

3369
04:01:25.66 --> 04:01:31.42
I mean, you can see that book is literally written from the heart.

3370
04:01:31.42 --> 04:01:33.66
All kinds of stuff in there to learn.

3371
04:01:33.66 --> 04:01:36.66
I read a tiny fraction of it today.

3372
04:01:36.66 --> 04:01:40.10
Leader substrategy and tactics field manual.

3373
04:01:40.10 --> 04:01:44.30
Apparently the number one book of some kind.

3374
04:01:44.30 --> 04:01:46.18
Appreciate everyone getting that book.

3375
04:01:46.18 --> 04:01:49.94
And what I really like is the feedback for them getting from people that you're taking

3376
04:01:49.94 --> 04:01:54.10
what you can read and what you read in there and immediately implementing it and it's helping.

3377
04:01:54.10 --> 04:01:55.46
So that's great to hear.

3378
04:01:55.46 --> 04:01:56.86
Leadership strategy and tactical manual.

3379
04:01:56.86 --> 04:02:01.62

What we do is go into companies, teams and organizations and solve problems.

Any problems.

3389
04:02:31.26 --> 04:02:33.18
I know that sounds crazy.

3390
04:02:33.18 --> 04:02:37.74
Any problems that you have at your team in your organization, in your business, they are

3391
04:02:37.74 --> 04:02:40.54

I always add echo trials and I am at Jockel Willink and once again, thanks to Gunnery,

3412
04:04:11.70 --> 04:04:15.98

3414
04:04:20.58 --> 04:04:30.10
And also thanks to you and your comrades in more charity affairs for taking care of our

3415
04:04:30.10 --> 04:04:33.46
fallen heroes.

3416
04:04:33.46 --> 04:04:41.18
And today, salute to all our service men and women who pay such a heavy price in so many

3417
04:04:41.18 --> 04:04:45.78
different ways to protect our freedom.

3418
04:04:45.78 --> 04:04:49.54
And to those that protect our freedom, hear at home, the police and law enforcement,

3419
04:04:49.54 --> 04:04:53.62
firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers and border

3420
04:04:53.62 --> 04:04:57.06
patrol and secret service.

3421
04:04:57.06 --> 04:05:02.58
Thank you for what you do every single day.

3422
04:05:02.58 --> 04:05:09.42
And do everyone else out there?

3423
04:05:09.42 --> 04:05:12.66
Life is short.

3424
04:05:12.66 --> 04:05:14.90
It is a finite thing.

3425
04:05:14.90 --> 04:05:22.98
And the clock is ticking.

3426
04:05:22.98 --> 04:05:26.42
So what are you going to do about that?

3427
04:05:26.42 --> 04:05:27.82
Where are you going to go?

3428
04:05:27.82 --> 04:05:29.58
Who are you going to impact?

3429
04:05:29.58 --> 04:05:36.86
What legacy are you going to leave?

3430
04:05:36.86 --> 04:05:43.66
Ask yourself those questions and don't forget what those of us who have seen death

3431
04:05:43.66 --> 04:05:53.02
closely don't forget what we learned from that.

3432
04:05:53.02 --> 04:05:56.98
Our time is short.

3433
04:05:56.98 --> 04:06:02.38
We'll make it count.

3434
04:06:02.38 --> 04:06:07.54
And until next time, this is Echo and Jocco.

3435
04:06:07.54 --> 04:06:28.58
Thank you.
