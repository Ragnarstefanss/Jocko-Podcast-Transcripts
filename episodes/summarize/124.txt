I mean, this, you know, Hac worth was just, you know, he always said, you know, he wasn't bald like today, you know, but you know, eighth of an inch, you know, razor sharp, you know, sides and all that. you got issues why that's how what are you doing even 11 o'clock at night because like I don't really start eating till like later in the day you say I don't know he breakfast like that you see him playing though like let's say he eat three meals a day and that's not a lot by the way that's actually a little bit you know some guys it all it's six times a day you know that kind not like that kind three times a day sometimes too so let's say I ate my first meal no breakfast only water maybe some coffee sometimes maybe some get ready sometimes maybe like a banana sometimes not a lot nonetheless at noon ish one maybe too lunch dinner You know, they said, you have an interest called this number, you know, and so I called, you know, and he said, hey, look, pull up my record, you know, you'll see, you know, I'm, I've got my masters degree in Fari Senefers. so right then and there the army knew what they were dealing with because I you know I was you know it was an opportunity to show that we have equal opportunity and he armed forces I tell people that one of the proudest things of my service was that when I was loose track of people's race you know I stopped looking at people as as Asian American or African American and in or Hispanic Americans I looked at them as private or full lieutenant whatever their job was in the military that's how I caught myself forgetting sometimes of people you know because I tell people everybody was all of drab. And, you know, I mean, the stupid rules of engagement that we had, you know, where do you have to get approval to fire on people, even though you're receiving fire, you know, and just nutty stuff, you know, and we just say, hey, you know, we're going to do what we have to do. so we have different programs that they can choose from some are as simple as a church can list the names of service members who are currently serving you know either relatives or members of the church and people can pray for them prayer is so important when you're overseas especially in a combat situation I know it helped me a lot when I was in combat I needed all I could get I'll tell you but also they could do things like send packages send letters how today who writes letters nobody you know it's all email and all that stuff how about getting a letter right at mail call how need is that you know we're on the path all of us one great now this is inevitable I think for the most part inevitable where you know hit moments of weakness sometimes you need a little help through those moments of weakness sometimes you need to just slip in those moments of weakness and fall and be like I'm not doing that again sometimes that's useful you learn in my opinion but in those moments of weakness where you just need a little spot this is what jockel tracks are for so let's say your weakness is not getting up early you want to hit the snooze so what you want to do to tie it on a note whatever maybe drink a little bit I don't know so you're on the fence you're like I'm gonna hit the snooze just for what what's the normal snooze 10 minutes nine minutes whatever I don't know seems to be good to tell me about that there's a mud over here it's true rotten and so you're balancing all that stuff and general Levine always remember emphasized the family he always made sure that we were aware of the stresses on the family you know when we were gone I'll never forget a microrear without fail that's when the furnace would break down that's when we'd have a blizzard so my 95 pound wife would have to go out there and shovel the snow because I wasn't there you know our son Jay who's who you know he he basically was a rascal when he was a young guy and my might have to take him to the emergency room in the hospital like three times I don't even know where it's time's a week You know, in my mind, you know, I thought everyone must look at Hac like, you know, this guy's Mr. Infantry as you put it, but I also would say to myself, well, you know, here's like, I'm thinking that because he wrote these books, and because I studied him, but that was an actual thing. he I think he's personally responsible for that balance part of my leadership concept that I've developed over my career uh he really emphasized family and and keep in mind when I joined the reserves I didn't have a clue about the citizen soldier you know those of us on air to duty what do we know about the garden reserves and their pressure you know what they do with you know people in the garden reserves have to balance three balls at the same time You know, he always said, bring your kids, you know, some guys would say, no, just, you know, bring your wife or whatever, because my kids were fairly young, and then we're really young, they were maybe eight or nine, you know, at that time. I mean, you know, but, you know, it was pretty sharp in the way of warming, you know, for my did have, you know, my jump wings and my E, I have an expert infantryman's badge, okay? And so when he came to see the general, he walks into the headquarters, you know, I'm sitting behind his desk, he walks in, so I stand up, you know, I say welcome Colonel Hacourt to Fort Lewis, you know, the general will be with you in 10 minutes, you know, because he came early, right? and I said you know what it's sad that you're surprised at that because 50 years ago everybody knew that that's where they made stuff they made it up there and it all disappeared and now it's coming back and we're bringing it back I told this guy it's a spring in a back we're bringing back made effect we got what weaving material up there you know what that you don't even know what I'm talking about people's first instinct is like You know, because, you know, really with the name which degree, as you know, you know, it's great for preparing you to understand things. so he writes a memorandum for record that to the chief of staff at the army that went into my file that said you know I spoke to John Wilmingham I told him it was you know above his paid rate levels and he might get involved with you know things that went out of hand and all that and he basically told me that he was going to wear his uniform so people come to me and say you know what difference are you guys making two years ago all I could say was what were developing this network of partners and we're asking them to help you know in their communities which did make a difference by the way I mean we prevented some suicides we've helped people that needed stuff you know okay so open decided they have a show about Japan bashing so she said if anybody knows anyone you know the Japanese American community what might be a good you know person on this please let me know Because I always felt that I shouldn't be managing my own career, you know, and if I, if I did my job, that the army would, you know, I, I'd be treated, okay, you know, well, none of that ever happened, right? I believe his name was but he had flown over heat scene what was happening he flew back to base told the senior leadership this is what's going on in the ground the senior leadership radioed into the field and said stop killing people and they they literally instantly stopped they stopped the massacre just because a leader stepped up and said stop so good leadership completely changed the situation as it was ongoing and clearly if there would have been a better leader on the ground that was leading in the right way it never would have even started so you can see here from what Hacks saying the way he led and the way he treated unknown you know people and then the way that was carried out through the whole battalion that's another amazing testament to good leadership. so I said is this in order you know from you know the secretary or from the chief I don't care you know whoever's above me is this in order and he said well I can't tell you it's in order but when we came up with this program we have a tracking thing where we know how many veterans are being helped we know what's been collected and we know so now if somebody says what difference do you make okay since January of 2016 we have helped over 31,000 veterans we've collected over 750,000 items in fact I think it's over million though and valued at almost 2 million dollars and we have we just provided this month our 1000's bed and and I said hey wait a second you know I don't have one day of finance formal education I didn't know the difference between a stock and a bond you know must for less a stock option and he said don't worry about it I felt the army was going in the wrong direction when it came to leadership I thought that they were looking for managers and not commanders I was in some positions during my career right had access to officer deficiency reports and I could see were the ratings of the senior officers that lieutenant colonels and the battalion commanders were the tendency was to give the managers high ratings irrespective of their command abilities and and then my personal career was was not managed very well the hack worth hack worth wanted me to stay he knew I was I was thinking of resigning and the fact that's why he offered me the company because you know he thought that experience might turn things around you know I'll do it and that started out of 35 year career in financial services industry and I became a member of the New York Stock Exchange the Chicago Board Options Exchange I was very blessed I became part-owner of the company so that enabled me to devote all the time I did in the reserves that I did because I was part of the deal I made with my friend I said listen if you want me to join you I'm bringing the reserves with me and you have to understand you know if I'm called I'm going and if I'm in the reserves I'm going to give it a hundred percent you know but it's real flimsy a lot of the time you got on it a lot of information on

interview presidents kings and queens political people you know at in Chicago at a restaurant and yeah because you don't want to run out I'm telling you it's junk when you're at out I run out before it's wack also discipline supplement called discipline it is a pre workout pre mission pre study pre take test pre cognitive enhancing supplements good this is a good one pre get after it and it tastes good interestingly you know jacco focused a lot on that taste good lemon lime etc etc make calories in this one I don't know not not okay the army reserve and army national guard are the so-called reserve components okay now the active army of course are the 24-7 that's their full-time job the army reserves are a federal force and the army reserves fall into the normal army chain of command the partner of the army we answer to the orders of the president okay army national guard does not fall into that chain of command nor do they be poured to the president they be poured to the governors of each state it's really a state organization although 95% of their budget comes from the federal government so in their mind I'm the village idiot you know even though I have my masters degree I had commanded a company in combat I had signed for $10 million worth of equipment I had more responsibility and life than these guys will ever know you know
