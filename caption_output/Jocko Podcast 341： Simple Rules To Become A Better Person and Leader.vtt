00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 341 with Carrie Helton and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, Carrie.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Good evening. Also joining us tonight, Dave Burke, good evening, Dave. Good evening.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.80
To Steve Prasanka, who showed us how to soldier to Henry DeBouer, who showed us how to die, to

4
00:00:21.80 --> 00:00:35.80
clever John's who showed us how to lead, and to all the doughboys, the ground pounders, the grunts, the American infantryman, past, present, and especially future.

5
00:00:35.80 --> 00:00:41.80
To them, this book is dedicated.

6
00:00:41.80 --> 00:00:48.80
And that, of course, is the opening dedication of the book about face by Colonel David Hackworth.

7
00:00:48.80 --> 00:00:56.80
I guess it's been a steady sort of just constant in my life to be reading this book over and over again.

8
00:00:56.80 --> 00:01:04.80
And I was thinking about that line the other day to Glover Johns, who showed us how to lead.

9
00:01:04.80 --> 00:01:07.80
And that's a bold statement, right?

10
00:01:07.80 --> 00:01:13.80
For him to put in the beginning of the book to talk about Glover Johns, who showed us how to lead.

11
00:01:13.80 --> 00:01:25.80
And I started thinking about, I don't think I'd really given the attention that I needed to, or that I've, that I've needed to, to Glover Johns.

12
00:01:25.80 --> 00:01:29.80
Now look, we've talked Glover Johns, we've covered Glover Johns on this podcast.

13
00:01:29.80 --> 00:01:35.80
He wrote the book, The Clay Pigeon, some say, low, we covered on podcast 87.

14
00:01:35.80 --> 00:01:41.80
But in this book, Hackworth kind of breaks down some of the stuff that he said.

15
00:01:41.80 --> 00:01:49.80
Some of his, some of Glover Johns leadership philosophy in a simple straightforward and powerful way.

16
00:01:49.80 --> 00:01:54.80
That is, well worth studying, definitely some things that we can get into.

17
00:01:54.80 --> 00:01:58.80
So, yeah, if you want to go listen to podcast 87, go back and do that.

18
00:01:58.80 --> 00:02:04.80
This is going to be about the leadership principles, not about the battle of St. Low at the, the Clay Pigeons.

19
00:02:04.80 --> 00:02:10.80
So, before we get into that, let me give you the, a little bit of background in case you're just going to jump into this podcast about Glover Johns.

20
00:02:10.80 --> 00:02:14.80
About Glover Johns is from about face. Here's a little intro.

21
00:02:14.80 --> 00:02:18.80
To who Glover Johns is?

22
00:02:18.80 --> 00:02:23.80
Hackworth says, I was to report to eighth division, first battle group, 18th Infantry.

23
00:02:23.80 --> 00:02:35.80
It was a nice twist to fate. The unit was a direct descendant of the US 18th, which my great, great grandfather, Jeremiah, and his eldest son, George Washington Hackworth,

24
00:02:35.80 --> 00:02:46.80
belonged to when they fought their Hackworth cousin Billy, who was with the Bedford's Forest Tennis E.C. calf during this of a war.

25
00:02:46.80 --> 00:02:49.80
So, he's good to do has a connect.

26
00:02:49.80 --> 00:02:55.80
Can you imagine having your relative, be fighting for the union army and you're in the same unit?

27
00:02:55.80 --> 00:03:14.80
The 18th was military perfection. Men stepped smartly across meticulously kept grounds, starched uniforms, blue infantry scarves, dazzling, shined brass and boots, snappy salutes, and cheerful, good afternoon, sirs, marked my journey to the HQ where I'd sign in.

28
00:03:14.80 --> 00:03:23.80
The spirit of this fine unit was already infecting me. The hot, stifling, windless day, the ragweed pollen that blew in from the adjacent fields,

29
00:03:23.80 --> 00:03:30.80
covering the camp and immediately activating my hay fever, the run down boring camp itself, none of it mattered.

30
00:03:30.80 --> 00:03:38.80
I was inwardly, as inwardly I was transported to an island oasis untouched by turbulent seas.

31
00:03:38.80 --> 00:03:50.80
And it was all thanks to one man. The Battle Group commanding officer, who would forever, after be my model, mentor and friend.

32
00:03:50.80 --> 00:04:00.80
Colonel Glover S. Johns was the finest senior infantry commander I'd ever seen or would ever see again.

33
00:04:00.80 --> 00:04:08.80
We shared a mutual abiding respect, almost from the moment we met. He was my kind of soldier and I was his. He was a warrior.

34
00:04:08.80 --> 00:04:17.80
Patent's aide before World War II. Then during the war he'd hit the beaches of Normandy as part of the 29th Division and fought from those bloody beaches.

35
00:04:17.80 --> 00:04:28.80
From those bloody shores all across Europe until victory was achieved. As a battalion commanding officer, he'd headed the task force that captured the critical French town of St. Low,

36
00:04:28.80 --> 00:04:33.80
Chronicle, his own hard-hitting book, the clay pigeons of St. Low.

37
00:04:33.80 --> 00:04:42.80
And Korea he'd served as exo. Then regimental commander in my own 40th Division. His reputation there was awesome.

38
00:04:42.80 --> 00:05:00.80
One story that made its way through the division was that a wild new exo had come to the 224th gotten down on his belly in the mud to check the units machine gun fields of fire and promptly move two thirds of the machine gun bunkers that had sat there for two years.

39
00:05:00.80 --> 00:05:11.80
We thought of my own fighter company renovations and wish to hell that this savvy character had been assigned to the 223rd.

40
00:05:11.80 --> 00:05:21.80
I noticed that his blue eyes sparkled like those of a wise and truly tested man who'd long since realized that humor could be found in just about anything.

41
00:05:21.80 --> 00:05:34.80
He'd seen his share of horror. His cheeks were rosy and the dueling scar that crossed one of them in no way detracted from his rugged yet gentle old soldier face.

42
00:05:34.80 --> 00:05:42.80
The scar, maybe the scar even enhanced it. I don't know, but it sure gave him more character and provided a good yarn to boot.

43
00:05:42.80 --> 00:05:50.80
In any event, Colonel Glover Johns was a 49 year old stud.

44
00:05:50.80 --> 00:05:59.80
So there you go. I think stud, if you don't know anything about hack worth, stud is the highest category of a human that you can give.

45
00:05:59.80 --> 00:06:05.80
That's the pinnacle of respect coming from him.

46
00:06:05.80 --> 00:06:07.80
Stud.

47
00:06:07.80 --> 00:06:15.80
And in fact he has studs or duds. He says that a bunch in the book. There's two kinds of people. Studs, duds.

48
00:06:15.80 --> 00:06:25.80
Some basic info. Some more info. Let me give you some more info and you'll have your John's born in 1912 in Austin, Texas grew up in Corpus Christi, Texas.

49
00:06:25.80 --> 00:06:31.80
His father went to VMI, class in 1908, but got kicked out for hell raising.

50
00:06:31.80 --> 00:06:42.80
I mean, what does that even mean? Is that in your record? Does it go in your record? Are they like, oh yeah. Dave Burke was kicked out of the school for hell raising.

51
00:06:42.80 --> 00:06:47.80
So his dad gets kicked out, but his uncles got two uncles. They go to VMI, 1915 and 1921.

52
00:06:47.80 --> 00:06:56.80
He Glover Johns ends up going to VMI. He's rifle, pistol, marksman, good at cross country.

53
00:06:56.80 --> 00:07:02.80
Graduates with a degree in chemistry, class in 1931, goes over to Germany.

54
00:07:02.80 --> 00:07:09.80
A studies first semester, he gets married. He has a son. He gets divorced. And he's a civilian, by the way.

55
00:07:09.80 --> 00:07:17.80
You know, and I couldn't quite forget, I think he's a national guard guy, but he's working at a bunch of just normal, normal work life.

56
00:07:17.80 --> 00:07:23.80
Some alcoholic company works at the chamber of commerce. He writes for the local newspaper.

57
00:07:23.80 --> 00:07:28.80
But as part of the Texas National Guard, he gets called the active duty in 1940.

58
00:07:28.80 --> 00:07:37.80
And he pretty much begs and maneuvers to get a job going into combat, which he ends up getting and going to Omaha Beach.

59
00:07:37.80 --> 00:07:40.80
She goes on, goes in Omaha Beach on D-Day.

60
00:07:40.80 --> 00:07:52.80
And D-Day plus one. So one day deep in the D-Day, he takes over the battalion, because apparently his, the person that was the battalion commander was not getting after it.

61
00:07:52.80 --> 00:07:55.80
So he replaces this weak commander.

62
00:07:55.80 --> 00:07:59.80
And it goes right into the, the headrow fighting, which,

63
00:07:59.80 --> 00:08:07.80
Banda Brothers, you know, if you know anything about D-Day, that headrow fighting was insane, they take crazy casualties.

64
00:08:07.80 --> 00:08:12.80
And his first day as battalion commander, he loses two radio operators and three of his battalion staff.

65
00:08:12.80 --> 00:08:16.80
Battalion staff, you're losing battalion staff.

66
00:08:16.80 --> 00:08:21.80
This is not a battalion staff that's sitting in the rear when you lose two radio operators.

67
00:08:21.80 --> 00:08:24.80
And three of your battalion staff.

68
00:08:24.80 --> 00:08:30.80
Constant combat, he's, he's in a leadership position in the battle of St. Lowe.

69
00:08:30.80 --> 00:08:38.80
And just to refresh your memory on that, the 29th Division lost more soldiers in the battle of St. Lowe than they did on Omaha Beach.

70
00:08:38.80 --> 00:08:44.80
So he ends up 11 months in command.

71
00:08:44.80 --> 00:08:49.80
He's awarded three silver stars, two bronze stars in purple heart.

72
00:08:49.80 --> 00:08:58.80
By the end of the war, John's unit, clubber John's unit had lost 2,400 men casualties.

73
00:08:58.80 --> 00:09:04.80
That's two and a half times bigger than the number of people in his unit, right?

74
00:09:04.80 --> 00:09:10.80
You know, your battalion size is what? 600 people, 700 people, 500 people, something like that.

75
00:09:10.80 --> 00:09:19.80
And they had had 2,400 casualties.

76
00:09:19.80 --> 00:09:22.80
He's married, it gets married again after the war.

77
00:09:22.80 --> 00:09:27.80
It does some, it has another couple of sons. He does peace time tours in Bulgaria and Turkey.

78
00:09:27.80 --> 00:09:31.80
Korean War kicks off. He maneuvers again to try and get to go over there.

79
00:09:31.80 --> 00:09:36.80
He does commands the 224th Infantry Regiment, the 40th Infantry Division.

80
00:09:36.80 --> 00:09:41.80
Fought in the punch bowl in Korea. Get down with Korea, go see Army War College.

81
00:09:41.80 --> 00:09:48.80
Goes to VMI. As the ROTC leader eventually becomes the VMI commandant.

82
00:09:48.80 --> 00:09:55.80
And in 1960, he becomes commander of the first battle group, 18th Infantry 8th Infantry Division.

83
00:09:55.80 --> 00:10:03.80
And he goes into this whole Berlin standoff when they were building the wall, when there's all these tensions.

84
00:10:03.80 --> 00:10:13.80
And he has to march, or, yeah, pretty much marching, 1500 soldiers right into Berlin, right through East Germany.

85
00:10:13.80 --> 00:10:17.80
They kind of face down the Soviet Union.

86
00:10:17.80 --> 00:10:27.80
There's a little anecdote in here that there was some guard, some Russian guard, or some East German guard, that wasn't opening a gate when they showed up.

87
00:10:27.80 --> 00:10:36.80
They need to get through and he was a bridge or something like this. And the guy says something, you know, like we're not opening this gate.

88
00:10:36.80 --> 00:10:40.80
And he says, well, you have to open this gate. He's like, no.

89
00:10:40.80 --> 00:10:48.80
And he says, this will start World War III if you come here. And then Glover John pulls out his 45 and says, you're going to be the first catch that the World War III and that's what opens the gate.

90
00:10:48.80 --> 00:10:51.80
It sounds too good to be true, right?

91
00:10:51.80 --> 00:10:52.80
It almost does.

92
00:10:52.80 --> 00:10:53.80
Right.

93
00:10:53.80 --> 00:10:54.80
But I don't know.

94
00:10:54.80 --> 00:10:56.80
It sounds like legend.

95
00:10:56.80 --> 00:11:00.80
Yeah, it could be. It could be, oh, by the way, the scar on his face.

96
00:11:00.80 --> 00:11:05.80
Everyone said he got it in a duel, but actually there's a footnote about it here.

97
00:11:05.80 --> 00:11:14.80
John's received the scar on an auto-mobile accident in Taipei. He was drunk at the time and barely missed receiving a general court martial upon his recovery.

98
00:11:14.80 --> 00:11:16.80
Yeah.

99
00:11:16.80 --> 00:11:20.80
Because they call it a dueling, so everyone thought it. So legends, man.

100
00:11:20.80 --> 00:11:21.80
Legends.

101
00:11:21.80 --> 00:11:22.80
There's some word that can come out.

102
00:11:22.80 --> 00:11:23.80
It's not true.

103
00:11:23.80 --> 00:11:27.80
I really want to believe the one about the first casualty of World War III.

104
00:11:27.80 --> 00:11:28.80
Yeah.

105
00:11:28.80 --> 00:11:30.80
You're going to be the first casualty there.

106
00:11:30.80 --> 00:11:31.80
Private.

107
00:11:31.80 --> 00:11:33.80
But it was a big deal.

108
00:11:33.80 --> 00:11:36.80
And this was a huge event in the early 60s.

109
00:11:36.80 --> 00:11:40.80
That whole standoff with the Soviets.

110
00:11:40.80 --> 00:11:45.80
And after that, he took a job as an attache in Spain.

111
00:11:45.80 --> 00:11:47.80
That was his last army job.

112
00:11:47.80 --> 00:11:51.80
Retired in Austin, Texas. He was a technical advisor on the movie Patent.

113
00:11:51.80 --> 00:11:52.80
Pretty good, Jit.

114
00:11:52.80 --> 00:11:55.80
Dietic cancer in 1976.

115
00:11:55.80 --> 00:11:58.80
His ashes are spread at VMI.

116
00:11:58.80 --> 00:12:02.80
So, there you go.

117
00:12:02.80 --> 00:12:04.80
Now, hackworth worked for him.

118
00:12:04.80 --> 00:12:08.80
And he worked for him during that march for Indiburlin.

119
00:12:08.80 --> 00:12:10.80
And there's great account of all that stuff.

120
00:12:10.80 --> 00:12:12.80
And what they thought was going to happen.

121
00:12:12.80 --> 00:12:14.80
I mean, World War III was on the line.

122
00:12:14.80 --> 00:12:18.80
This was a standoff between two giant nuclear superpowers.

123
00:12:18.80 --> 00:12:23.80
And the word was, if World War III starts all these,

124
00:12:23.80 --> 00:12:25.80
that entire regiment's going to wipe out immediately.

125
00:12:25.80 --> 00:12:28.80
Because they're just, no one's going to be able to help him.

126
00:12:28.80 --> 00:12:33.80
There's a quote in here that's from Colonel John.

127
00:12:33.80 --> 00:12:34.80
In the book about face, he says,

128
00:12:34.80 --> 00:12:37.80
I drove hard and raised hell when I didn't get what I wanted.

129
00:12:37.80 --> 00:12:38.80
I made waves.

130
00:12:38.80 --> 00:12:40.80
I bitched about supply procedures.

131
00:12:40.80 --> 00:12:45.80
I fought for my men if I fought them unjustly accused by a higher HQ.

132
00:12:45.80 --> 00:12:50.80
I fought problems too hard from a love of my men.

133
00:12:50.80 --> 00:12:54.80
As opposed to someone else's men or my own bosses interest.

134
00:12:54.80 --> 00:13:00.80
Because I had identified too closely with them due to my World War II experiences.

135
00:13:00.80 --> 00:13:04.80
I think I saw too many men killed and blood too deeply inside

136
00:13:04.80 --> 00:13:09.80
with the result that I was overprotective.

137
00:13:09.80 --> 00:13:11.80
And hackworth goes on to say,

138
00:13:11.80 --> 00:13:16.80
overprotective he may well have been, but Colonel John's translated his love for his men

139
00:13:16.80 --> 00:13:21.80
into one thing that would save them when he was not there.

140
00:13:21.80 --> 00:13:28.80
To wield the sword himself, good, realistic training, a spree to core, and high morale.

141
00:13:28.80 --> 00:13:35.80
Or on a bashed cockiness, some might say, within the units in his command.

142
00:13:35.80 --> 00:13:47.80
So, the last thing is, John's eventually got orders out of the battle group in Berlin.

143
00:13:47.80 --> 00:13:50.80
So hackworth is there with him in Berlin.

144
00:13:50.80 --> 00:13:52.80
And he gets orders to go do something else.

145
00:13:52.80 --> 00:13:54.80
And he gives a farewell speech.

146
00:13:54.80 --> 00:13:57.80
And during this farewell speech, according to hackworth,

147
00:13:57.80 --> 00:14:03.80
he, John's broke down the basic philosophy of soldering which he had,

148
00:14:03.80 --> 00:14:09.80
which hack said was like being let in on the secret ingredients of some magical formula.

149
00:14:09.80 --> 00:14:12.80
That's the thing about that.

150
00:14:12.80 --> 00:14:16.80
This is hackworth saying he gets this list of things.

151
00:14:16.80 --> 00:14:17.80
And it's in the book.

152
00:14:17.80 --> 00:14:22.80
And you read it in a page and you're like, okay, cool.

153
00:14:22.80 --> 00:14:26.80
And hack says it's like a secret ingredients of a magical formula.

154
00:14:26.80 --> 00:14:29.80
This is obviously something we should be paying attention to.

155
00:14:29.80 --> 00:14:31.80
And this is why I kind of got drawn back into it.

156
00:14:31.80 --> 00:14:38.80
So, here is leading and soldering according to Colonel Glober Johns,

157
00:14:38.80 --> 00:14:40.80
who taught us how to lead.

158
00:14:40.80 --> 00:14:50.80
The first one is strive to do the small things well.

159
00:14:50.80 --> 00:14:52.80
Strive to do the small things well.

160
00:14:52.80 --> 00:14:55.80
There's a quote how you do anything is how you do everything.

161
00:14:55.80 --> 00:14:57.80
Is this similar idea, right?

162
00:14:57.80 --> 00:15:03.80
Because if you let the little things go, then what happens to the big things?

163
00:15:03.80 --> 00:15:09.80
You guys had to be super anal in the fighter pilot community.

164
00:15:09.80 --> 00:15:12.80
Yeah, there are things you gotta be anal about.

165
00:15:12.80 --> 00:15:18.80
And I think you certainly have to have a philosophy of it's the little things that will kill you.

166
00:15:18.80 --> 00:15:21.80
If you don't do the little things well, it's really hard to do the big things well.

167
00:15:21.80 --> 00:15:24.80
Obviously there's a balance inside there, but yes.

168
00:15:24.80 --> 00:15:28.80
How do you, so you know some people are really detail oriented.

169
00:15:28.80 --> 00:15:29.80
Some people are not detail oriented.

170
00:15:29.80 --> 00:15:31.80
You got every spectrum in between, right?

171
00:15:31.80 --> 00:15:31.80
Yep.

172
00:15:31.80 --> 00:15:35.80
How do you get like who's who's in charge of the planes maintenance?

173
00:15:35.80 --> 00:15:36.80
Your planes maintenance.

174
00:15:36.80 --> 00:15:38.80
So Dave Burke, you have your plane.

175
00:15:38.80 --> 00:15:39.80
What do you have a tail number on your planes?

176
00:15:39.80 --> 00:15:40.80
Do you identify your plane?

177
00:15:40.80 --> 00:15:43.80
Yeah, you have a number on your name on your names.

178
00:15:43.80 --> 00:15:45.80
So Dave Burke's plane.

179
00:15:45.80 --> 00:15:48.80
But I don't always, I don't fly that plane all the time, but yes, I've got a plane.

180
00:15:48.80 --> 00:15:50.80
Okay, you have a plane like my plane.

181
00:15:50.80 --> 00:15:53.80
Is there someone that's in charge of that plane?

182
00:15:53.80 --> 00:15:54.80
Yes.

183
00:15:54.80 --> 00:15:56.80
And is he owned that plane more than you do kind of?

184
00:15:56.80 --> 00:15:57.80
Yes.

185
00:15:57.80 --> 00:15:59.80
And what's his job?

186
00:15:59.80 --> 00:16:02.80
He's a, what we would call a power line mechanic.

187
00:16:02.80 --> 00:16:09.80
And that means the aircraft itself, he's assigned to that aircraft and he is responsible for that aircraft being airworthy.

188
00:16:09.80 --> 00:16:11.80
Meaning it's legit to fly.

189
00:16:11.80 --> 00:16:12.80
How many aircraft is your responsible for?

190
00:16:12.80 --> 00:16:13.80
Usually one.

191
00:16:13.80 --> 00:16:14.80
Yes.

192
00:16:14.80 --> 00:16:16.80
So this is your, this is your guy.

193
00:16:16.80 --> 00:16:21.80
Yeah, if you're going to have a relationship inside the squadron and you're flying an airplane,

194
00:16:21.80 --> 00:16:23.80
the plane captain of that plane, you should have a good relationship.

195
00:16:23.80 --> 00:16:25.80
So he's called the plane captain.

196
00:16:25.80 --> 00:16:26.80
Yeah.

197
00:16:26.80 --> 00:16:27.80
What rank is he?

198
00:16:27.80 --> 00:16:29.80
Probably a Lance Corporal or a Corporal?

199
00:16:29.80 --> 00:16:31.80
Be a young kid.

200
00:16:31.80 --> 00:16:32.80
Like huge responsible.

201
00:16:32.80 --> 00:16:33.80
He's 22 years old.

202
00:16:33.80 --> 00:16:34.80
22 year old, Corporal.

203
00:16:34.80 --> 00:16:37.80
22 year old, Corporal and he's the plane captain.

204
00:16:37.80 --> 00:16:38.80
Yes.

205
00:16:38.80 --> 00:16:44.80
Okay, so with the question I was going to ask is, and then I thought that guy was going to be an E7.

206
00:16:44.80 --> 00:16:45.80
No.

207
00:16:45.80 --> 00:16:47.80
Marine Corps don't lie.

208
00:16:47.80 --> 00:16:48.80
They're like you all response.

209
00:16:48.80 --> 00:16:49.80
I'm a percent.

210
00:16:49.80 --> 00:16:55.80
So the question I was going to ask is, you got people that are naturally very detailed

211
00:16:55.80 --> 00:16:56.80
ones.

212
00:16:56.80 --> 00:16:58.80
You got people that aren't.

213
00:16:58.80 --> 00:17:00.80
Do they are they screening people out when they go to a school?

214
00:17:00.80 --> 00:17:03.80
Are they going to a school where they're like, oh yeah, slip them out over here.

215
00:17:03.80 --> 00:17:05.80
He ain't going to be in charge of a plane.

216
00:17:05.80 --> 00:17:07.80
We're going to put him in charge of, you know, something else.

217
00:17:07.80 --> 00:17:12.80
Yeah, I would imagine the criteria to make sure those people get to where they're supposed to be.

218
00:17:12.80 --> 00:17:14.80
And eventually be responsible for an aircraft.

219
00:17:14.80 --> 00:17:16.80
There are some things along the way that they've had to screen for.

220
00:17:16.80 --> 00:17:19.80
But I mean, this dude's only been in the Marine Corps for like three years.

221
00:17:19.80 --> 00:17:20.80
Well, that's the Marine Corps.

222
00:17:20.80 --> 00:17:22.80
Oh, yeah.

223
00:17:22.80 --> 00:17:27.80
Yeah, I mean, even getting into aviation, I think there's probably some attributes that they screen for initially,

224
00:17:27.80 --> 00:17:32.80
you know, even which basic MOS or what basic part of the Marine Corps you go to.

225
00:17:32.80 --> 00:17:37.80
And then inside that certainly, even though it's, I think it really will be fast screening process,

226
00:17:37.80 --> 00:17:41.80
the process to be qualified to be a plane captain is no joke.

227
00:17:41.80 --> 00:17:44.80
And then how many people do you have on his team?

228
00:17:44.80 --> 00:17:46.80
He'll probably have one or two other guys.

229
00:17:46.80 --> 00:17:52.80
So, you know, a guy who's responsible for an aircraft, he'll have probably one other person who's in like the training pipeline,

230
00:17:52.80 --> 00:17:54.80
you know, getting, getting certified and getting evaluated.

231
00:17:54.80 --> 00:18:00.80
So when I walk out to a jet and I'm going to go man up that jet and go fly it, the plane captain is there and you'll have somebody with him.

232
00:18:00.80 --> 00:18:03.80
And he's watching observing and then he'll be doing more.

233
00:18:03.80 --> 00:18:07.80
And then at some point, he'll go out a couple months later and like, hey, sir, you know,

234
00:18:07.80 --> 00:18:10.80
this other Marine is going to take the lead on on today's mission.

235
00:18:10.80 --> 00:18:15.80
Or whatever that might be and he's kind of doing what we call left seat, right seat, or sort of a training run.

236
00:18:15.80 --> 00:18:20.80
So you're saying that the, the, the plane captain he's doing work or he's not doing.

237
00:18:20.80 --> 00:18:22.80
Is he, is he turning wrenches?

238
00:18:22.80 --> 00:18:25.80
Absolutely. Well, the other key responsibility that the plane captain has.

239
00:18:25.80 --> 00:18:29.80
And this is different in other services, but in the Marine Corps it's very specific.

240
00:18:29.80 --> 00:18:34.80
The plane captain, they call it power line because you're responsible for the line that aircraft flying all the jets.

241
00:18:34.80 --> 00:18:36.80
You're also responsible for the power plants.

242
00:18:36.80 --> 00:18:40.80
So these are your engine mechanics. So when the Marine Corps, the engine mechanic,

243
00:18:40.80 --> 00:18:45.80
his other responsibility is the nose to tail responsibility of that aircraft.

244
00:18:45.80 --> 00:18:49.80
So not only is he the guy literally from the nose to the tail of that jet,

245
00:18:49.80 --> 00:18:54.80
make sure that thing is ready to go. He's also the one that is responsible for the engines.

246
00:18:54.80 --> 00:18:56.80
Corp.

247
00:18:56.80 --> 00:18:57.80
Corporals in the Marine Corps.

248
00:18:57.80 --> 00:19:04.80
And as you might have imagined, I had a very, very good relationship with every single plane captain in the squadron.

249
00:19:04.80 --> 00:19:09.80
And in fact, my first real leadership job when I first got into the Marine Corps into a fighter squadron,

250
00:19:09.80 --> 00:19:11.80
you know, you spend some time in operations.

251
00:19:11.80 --> 00:19:14.80
You're going to have to write this schedule. Then they give you a real job.

252
00:19:14.80 --> 00:19:17.80
And my first real job was called the power line OIC.

253
00:19:17.80 --> 00:19:22.80
So I was the officer in charge of the power line division, the engine mechs and the plane captains.

254
00:19:22.80 --> 00:19:25.80
And to this day, probably the best job I had.

255
00:19:25.80 --> 00:19:28.80
And what are the 18 planes in the squadron?

256
00:19:28.80 --> 00:19:31.80
12, 12, 12.

257
00:19:31.80 --> 00:19:34.80
And there's one officer in charge of all these landsquiz.

258
00:19:34.80 --> 00:19:35.80
There are senior and listed guys.

259
00:19:35.80 --> 00:19:38.80
Yeah, there's a guy who's like the most square to win the squadron.

260
00:19:38.80 --> 00:19:41.80
We've got to have ever known, you know, rich pilgrim with your other listen.

261
00:19:41.80 --> 00:19:44.80
And the goes who he is, huge, huge impact on my life.

262
00:19:44.80 --> 00:19:47.80
Massively influential Marine.

263
00:19:47.80 --> 00:19:50.80
And 30 plus young Marines.

264
00:19:50.80 --> 00:19:52.80
You know, there's sergeants, there's a staff sergeant.

265
00:19:52.80 --> 00:19:55.80
But it's almost all land corpals and corpals.

266
00:19:55.80 --> 00:19:57.80
Making it happen.

267
00:19:57.80 --> 00:19:59.80
It's the best job ever for a can legit.

268
00:19:59.80 --> 00:20:06.80
So obviously in that scenario that doing the small things right is a mandatory.

269
00:20:06.80 --> 00:20:12.80
It's, I mean, I remember going through the certification process myself because I wanted to.

270
00:20:12.80 --> 00:20:15.80
I wanted to know what it was like to be certified as a plane captain.

271
00:20:15.80 --> 00:20:20.80
So I was young enough in my career that I had the time to be able to do that.

272
00:20:20.80 --> 00:20:25.80
And even just the questions that get asked on these boards to certify these Marines,

273
00:20:25.80 --> 00:20:35.80
the level of detail inside that was indicative that the message was, they wanted the Marines understand how important these little details were.

274
00:20:35.80 --> 00:20:46.80
Because of what, what was it risk if those small details get missed, especially in, you know, a really expensive, really fast machine that has this huge amount of responsibility and says massive asset you can't just replace.

275
00:20:46.80 --> 00:20:54.80
And that philosophy of the little things will kill you was embedded from the very, very beginning.

276
00:20:54.80 --> 00:20:58.80
So I read a book a long time ago. It's about desert one.

277
00:20:58.80 --> 00:21:05.80
And one of the reasons that desert one failed was aircraft.

278
00:21:05.80 --> 00:21:08.80
Couldn't complete the mission and I'll do a podcast about it at some point.

279
00:21:08.80 --> 00:21:16.80
But so so they want to get the best pilots for desert one to go there flying to Iran and do the refueling and rescue the hostages, right?

280
00:21:16.80 --> 00:21:19.80
Some of the pilots were at least one set of the pilots.

281
00:21:19.80 --> 00:21:26.80
The helicopter pilots came from flying Air Force 2. What's the helicopter? What's the president helicopter?

282
00:21:26.80 --> 00:21:28.80
The Marine Corps, it's HMX1.

283
00:21:28.80 --> 00:21:31.80
Okay. That's the Marine Corps helicopters. That's the presidential helicopter.

284
00:21:31.80 --> 00:21:33.80
Okay. So maybe it was those guys.

285
00:21:33.80 --> 00:21:39.80
And those guys, they're not playing around any issue with any of that bird at all and it's not flying.

286
00:21:39.80 --> 00:21:40.80
Yeah.

287
00:21:40.80 --> 00:21:44.80
And so there's in the main rotors on a helicopter.

288
00:21:44.80 --> 00:21:49.80
There's hydrogen inside. There's like a tube that has a hydrogen in it.

289
00:21:49.80 --> 00:21:57.80
And then there's a hydrogen sensor that will tell you if there's something wrong, if there's a crack, if there's something wrong with those blades,

290
00:21:57.80 --> 00:22:01.80
this hydrogen sensor goes up. Oh, we got a problem with our blades. We need to land.

291
00:22:01.80 --> 00:22:08.80
And that's the way that they keep those things safe because you can have, you know, some kind of a stress fracture or something in your, in your rotor blade.

292
00:22:08.80 --> 00:22:11.80
And if that thing comes apart, you know, you got major issues.

293
00:22:11.80 --> 00:22:21.80
Well, the, like the Navy pilots in, in the sea wolves, they just flew with the freaking hydrogen thing.

294
00:22:21.80 --> 00:22:23.80
Just they would just like take it out.

295
00:22:23.80 --> 00:22:26.80
They didn't want to hear about it. Like they're flying this thing.

296
00:22:26.80 --> 00:22:27.80
The army pilots were like that.

297
00:22:27.80 --> 00:22:33.80
So there was a lot of pilots that were just saying, hey, dude, you know, like whatever, pretty much whatever.

298
00:22:33.80 --> 00:22:35.80
Hey, get it fixed later.

299
00:22:35.80 --> 00:22:44.80
And, but they had this, this attentiveness to details that will say, nope, hydrogen, we got a hydrogen. We got something wrong with our blade. We got a land.

300
00:22:44.80 --> 00:22:47.80
And they left an office on now, they're short and aircrafted.

301
00:22:47.80 --> 00:22:53.80
It's one of the things that led to it was we didn't have these kind of combat experience pilots.

302
00:22:53.80 --> 00:22:58.80
Like if that would have been a sea wolf pilot, bro, this guy would have been like, what?

303
00:22:58.80 --> 00:23:07.80
So just like anything else, if you go overboard with the small things, you're going to miss some big things, including executing a mission.

304
00:23:07.80 --> 00:23:08.80
Yeah.

305
00:23:08.80 --> 00:23:16.80
What's cool about understanding how important the small things are rather than overlooking them is that actually gives you some insight about what you can and can't tolerate.

306
00:23:16.80 --> 00:23:21.80
Meaning, if I don't pay attention to any of the little things because I'm a big picture guy, I don't care.

307
00:23:21.80 --> 00:23:25.80
There's some little things that are going to kill me and I might not know about it.

308
00:23:25.80 --> 00:23:35.80
But if I'm sort of obsessive about knowing all those things, what actually gives me an airplane and really anything, it gives me an understanding of that, that little thing, that is a little thing.

309
00:23:35.80 --> 00:23:39.80
We're going to ignore that and we're going to press or that little thing.

310
00:23:39.80 --> 00:23:46.80
It's fine now, but if it leads to this and this, then we got a problem that could get worse or that little thing will get us killed.

311
00:23:46.80 --> 00:23:54.80
You got to know what those little things are and know whether to ignore them, pay attention to them or respond to them.

312
00:23:54.80 --> 00:23:58.80
Those are three different kind of key criteria, but if you don't know what those things are, you can't make those small decisions.

313
00:23:58.80 --> 00:24:02.80
So you got to know those things. You don't have to react to all of them, but you got to know them.

314
00:24:02.80 --> 00:24:08.80
How long did it take to study to get your certification and how, like, did you have to put in some work?

315
00:24:08.80 --> 00:24:11.80
Oh yeah, I mean, I ended the whole thing.

316
00:24:11.80 --> 00:24:18.80
It was a several month thing and I had a blast doing it because it was a great way to get to know my Marines and really for me more than anything.

317
00:24:18.80 --> 00:24:23.80
It was to get to know what the challenge is or why it was a big deal for me is we are getting ready to go in a carrier.

318
00:24:23.80 --> 00:24:29.80
And they called him brown shirts. They were brown jerseys on the carrier. Those are your plane captain. Those are your crew chiefs.

319
00:24:29.80 --> 00:24:35.80
And they have the most unappreciated, unforgiving job. They're the ones out there.

320
00:24:35.80 --> 00:24:40.80
Two o'clock in the morning trying to fix an engine hanging over the side of an aircraft carrier.

321
00:24:40.80 --> 00:24:43.80
So that jet is on the flat, it's good to the next day.

322
00:24:43.80 --> 00:24:47.80
Really underappreciated the amount of work and how important that work was.

323
00:24:47.80 --> 00:24:51.80
And I wanted to understand that. So I could help advocate to get them the things I needed to be successful.

324
00:24:51.80 --> 00:24:58.80
And the only way to do that is to know what they're going through. So I went through the entire process to get certified to learn about that.

325
00:24:58.80 --> 00:25:01.80
It also is a great way to get to know the Marines extremely well.

326
00:25:01.80 --> 00:25:05.80
But being a brown shirt, being a crew chief, a plane captain, on a carrier.

327
00:25:05.80 --> 00:25:11.80
Man, those young kids are putting in just the most ridiculous hours doing the hardest job in the world.

328
00:25:11.80 --> 00:25:18.80
With almost no thanks, no appreciation at all because what they need is to get a jet to make the flat schedule.

329
00:25:18.80 --> 00:25:25.80
And then, you know, Dave Burke, man's up the jet and gets all the glory because he launches off the carriers out for a 45 minute air condition flight.

330
00:25:25.80 --> 00:25:29.80
So it all comes back, lands it, turns the keys over and say, here's my rental.

331
00:25:29.80 --> 00:25:33.80
Yeah, I mean, that's the joke. It's like, hey, I took the jet, I come back and I go, hey, this thing's busted.

332
00:25:33.80 --> 00:25:35.80
And I didn't the keys, I leave.

333
00:25:35.80 --> 00:25:39.80
And obviously, I didn't want to be one of those pilots. And those pilots exist.

334
00:25:39.80 --> 00:25:40.80
Yeah.

335
00:25:40.80 --> 00:25:49.80
Right now, just so you know, there are thousands of power line Marines listening to this conversation that are stoked that you're talking about.

336
00:25:49.80 --> 00:25:53.80
How many parts do you know, we're part of an F-18?

337
00:25:53.80 --> 00:25:55.80
No, I could even guess.

338
00:25:55.80 --> 00:26:00.80
Do they have to know every individual system or do they just know?

339
00:26:00.80 --> 00:26:06.80
The engine, the engine, yes. I mean, we're talking every single thing in an engine from the front to the back.

340
00:26:06.80 --> 00:26:14.80
Now, you have airframes, you have electric, you have high-jalk, you have other major subsystems that these plane captains have a general understanding of, but no one near the detail.

341
00:26:14.80 --> 00:26:22.80
But when it comes to the engine, every single thing. And I'm sure it's true for all of them, but a Hornet engine is a complex piece of machinery.

342
00:26:22.80 --> 00:26:24.80
Sure.

343
00:26:24.80 --> 00:26:34.80
So from a leadership perspective, if you strive to do the small things, if you strive to do the small things well, it's going to help you.

344
00:26:34.80 --> 00:26:42.80
You can't become obsessed with them. We have to be careful of that. That becomes OCD, right? You will work for OCD, person?

345
00:26:42.80 --> 00:26:57.80
Yes. I work for OCD seal. And it was, you know, you know, we work through it, but it's just like any other sort of like mental health issue where the person just doesn't understand that they've got it.

346
00:26:57.80 --> 00:27:10.80
You know, and you're like, sir, I do really want, yeah, yeah, we, I can, we, you know, whatever, whatever the case may be, whether it's all the fonts need to, you get those fonts straight no outer, you know, the drying cage needs to look like just whatever the thing is.

347
00:27:10.80 --> 00:27:16.80
Then they're losing their minds about it, and it's not healthy, and you can't convince them of otherwise.

348
00:27:16.80 --> 00:27:20.80
It's hard to even address it with them, because they just look at you like you're crazy.

349
00:27:20.80 --> 00:27:23.80
So don't be that person.

350
00:27:23.80 --> 00:27:32.80
Yes, do the small things well, yes, pay attention, but don't get obsessed with them because then you won't be paying attention to the things that you need to pay attention to.

351
00:27:32.80 --> 00:27:34.80
So that's number one.

352
00:27:34.80 --> 00:27:36.80
All right, next one.

353
00:27:36.80 --> 00:27:40.80
Colonel Glover Johns to be a doer and a self-starter.

354
00:27:40.80 --> 00:27:58.80
Aggressiveness and initiatives and initiative are two most admired qualities in a leader, but he throws the dichotomy in there, but you must also put your feet up and think.

355
00:27:58.80 --> 00:28:02.80
This is interesting on 97 different levels, all right.

356
00:28:02.80 --> 00:28:09.80
So we're talking about being default aggressive, and this is something that it is.

357
00:28:09.80 --> 00:28:15.80
Clearly, he's talking about it as well, and clearly as a human, you got to make things happen.

358
00:28:15.80 --> 00:28:19.80
And talking and planning and dreaming and all that stuff doesn't matter.

359
00:28:19.80 --> 00:28:20.80
That's actually doesn't matter.

360
00:28:20.80 --> 00:28:23.80
What matters is taking action, making things happen.

361
00:28:23.80 --> 00:28:25.80
That's what's going to be good.

362
00:28:25.80 --> 00:28:30.80
And the Marine Corps has an awesome mentality.

363
00:28:30.80 --> 00:28:36.80
And they want their leaders to have a bias for action, which is exactly what is being said here.

364
00:28:36.80 --> 00:28:39.80
Being a doer and being a self-starter.

365
00:28:39.80 --> 00:28:44.80
That means having a bias for action, you're general move is I'm going to take action.

366
00:28:44.80 --> 00:28:49.80
That's what the Marine Corps wants their Marines to have is a bias fraction.

367
00:28:49.80 --> 00:28:57.80
Now, when I was teaching young seals, I told them they needed to be default aggressive, which is a little stronger.

368
00:28:57.80 --> 00:29:00.80
It's actually probably quite a bit stronger than a bias fraction.

369
00:29:00.80 --> 00:29:06.80
It's like, okay, yep, I'm going to make a decision. I'm going to take action. Okay, cool.

370
00:29:06.80 --> 00:29:10.80
I need a guy's to be aggressive.

371
00:29:10.80 --> 00:29:12.80
Make things happen.

372
00:29:12.80 --> 00:29:20.80
And the reason is because the situations I was putting these young seals in was it needed more than just a bias for action to get them going in the right direction.

373
00:29:20.80 --> 00:29:24.80
They needed to actually be like, oh, I'm not doing anything bad things are happening.

374
00:29:24.80 --> 00:29:27.80
I need to get aggressive right now.

375
00:29:27.80 --> 00:29:31.80
So that's where that comes from.

376
00:29:31.80 --> 00:29:43.80
And like I said, if you're a person in life and you find yourself hesitating, you might need to program yourself to have a default aggressive attitude, not just a bias for action.

377
00:29:43.80 --> 00:29:45.80
And not just, well, I'm going to be a doer.

378
00:29:45.80 --> 00:29:47.80
Even be a doer is pretty soft.

379
00:29:47.80 --> 00:29:55.80
That's not going to push you through some mayhem where things are blowing up and you're like, well, I'm not sure what I should do.

380
00:29:55.80 --> 00:29:57.80
I'm going to sit here and wait to see what happens. No.

381
00:29:57.80 --> 00:29:59.80
Need to go.

382
00:30:01.80 --> 00:30:07.80
Now he sends this, but you also must put your feet up and think.

383
00:30:07.80 --> 00:30:15.80
This is the most interesting, well, I guess one of the most interesting descriptions of detachment that I've heard and what a good one.

384
00:30:15.80 --> 00:30:23.80
Let's face it. There's no possible way you can literally put your feet up and think unless you're a less you detach.

385
00:30:23.80 --> 00:30:39.80
So he's saying, you gotta do more than just, you know, think you gotta put your feet up and think and he's saying that for a reason. He's saying that because, well, I guess I'm assuming he's saying that because he's told plenty guys, hey, you need to think about what's happening and they're like, oh, and they still make a bad decision.

386
00:30:39.80 --> 00:30:43.80
You know, they're just like in brain imploding.

387
00:30:43.80 --> 00:30:47.80
He's saying, hey, take a step back. Look, sit down.

388
00:30:47.80 --> 00:30:53.80
Okay, I'm going on to put your feet up and think. That's what I need you to do.

389
00:30:53.80 --> 00:31:01.80
Think of the literal sense of that, too. And you, you, once described talking about the idea of detachment of when you said you're writing, when you write things down.

390
00:31:01.80 --> 00:31:05.80
Hmm. It's a good one. You, you're a, it's a literal form of detachment.

391
00:31:05.80 --> 00:31:07.80
Yep.

392
00:31:07.80 --> 00:31:13.80
And I'm thinking of, especially like a few days soldier, it's really hard to do anything when you're feet are up.

393
00:31:13.80 --> 00:31:18.80
Literally, like, and I have this picture of this person who's at a desk is feet are up on the desk.

394
00:31:18.80 --> 00:31:22.80
And you actually can't do or go or move anywhere when you're feet are up.

395
00:31:22.80 --> 00:31:27.80
And even just the start contrasting your mind of what he means by that, which isn't just a stop and thing.

396
00:31:27.80 --> 00:31:31.80
It's actually put yourself in a position where you're not doing anything while you're thinking.

397
00:31:31.80 --> 00:31:38.80
And then, of course, the dichotomy inside there. And I just can't help but imagine the idea that he understands that.

398
00:31:38.80 --> 00:31:44.80
And I think you did two in Test Union, Bruser is when you start correlating a little bit of risk of not doing something.

399
00:31:44.80 --> 00:31:50.80
It's not like he would get a little behind on the project or we get a, we'll finish it money inside a Friday or we get a little over budget.

400
00:31:50.80 --> 00:31:55.80
If you don't get this thing done in combat, the risk of that is astonishing.

401
00:31:55.80 --> 00:32:01.80
And when you understand the natural human bias is not to do those things.

402
00:32:01.80 --> 00:32:11.80
Sometimes pushing to the default aggressive is actually where you have to go to get them to get away from that natural state, which is to do nothing.

403
00:32:11.80 --> 00:32:16.80
Yeah, I think I've got this somewhere else in this in the, in the main, my notes here, but

404
00:32:16.80 --> 00:32:25.80
The power curve, which is a real thing in life. I don't know it's a real thing in the air, but we used to use that term that, oh, you don't get behind the power curve.

405
00:32:25.80 --> 00:32:30.80
That means all the stuff that you have to get done, you get behind the power curve and you're done.

406
00:32:30.80 --> 00:32:35.80
You can't catch up again. That's right. So that's what happens in an aircraft, right? How does it work?

407
00:32:35.80 --> 00:32:49.80
So yeah, the power curve in aircraft is a place literally, it's a curve that they draw on its base on like factors like thrust and lift is if you get behind the power curve, it requires more power than you have.

408
00:32:49.80 --> 00:32:58.80
Then you have, which, again, in that literal sense and the curve is like, once you get past that curve, you know, I think this thing is like more power to go slower.

409
00:32:58.80 --> 00:33:05.80
Like, you don't have the power or the thrust to keep the aircraft doing what it's doing and if you get behind the power curve,

410
00:33:05.80 --> 00:33:11.80
it is an unrecoverable thing and like, you know, unless you do some other things and give up some other things, which you don't want to do.

411
00:33:11.80 --> 00:33:14.80
Well, if you're at altitude, you can put nose down, you can regain your speed.

412
00:33:14.80 --> 00:33:15.80
Yes, that's what I would usually do.

413
00:33:15.80 --> 00:33:17.80
Yes, that's what you're doing.

414
00:33:17.80 --> 00:33:23.80
But to your point, like, there's, you can, if you do these other things, you don't have to get there.

415
00:33:23.80 --> 00:33:32.80
Yeah, there was a stone who was getting in, talking to some like command historian or something like this.

416
00:33:32.80 --> 00:33:37.80
And he told this command historian and the command historian showed it to me.

417
00:33:37.80 --> 00:33:41.80
He was, he said something along the lines, yeah, well, in Ramadi,

418
00:33:41.80 --> 00:33:46.80
Joko had to beat his head against the wall to get a mission done.

419
00:33:46.80 --> 00:33:52.80
It was like every, every mission to make a mission happen, there was like so much stuff that you had to do to get it to go.

420
00:33:52.80 --> 00:34:02.80
And that's what it feels like when you talk about, oh, these little things like this little documents that you got to get put out this, you got to go run to this brief.

421
00:34:02.80 --> 00:34:03.80
You got to go talk to this person.

422
00:34:03.80 --> 00:34:06.80
There's all these things that have to take place.

423
00:34:06.80 --> 00:34:11.80
And not to mention the weapons have to be prep the vehicles need to be ready to plan asthma.

424
00:34:11.80 --> 00:34:12.80
All those things are going on.

425
00:34:12.80 --> 00:34:16.80
And if you fall back behind that power curve, you're just not going to do it.

426
00:34:16.80 --> 00:34:18.80
You know, I'm just going to happen.

427
00:34:18.80 --> 00:34:22.80
You have to be just, just full thrust.

428
00:34:22.80 --> 00:34:33.80
You have to just keep it there and sure after the op, you can be like, okay, I'm going to back off a little bit and save a little bit of gas right now, but it's not going to take more than a couple hours before you better put that.

429
00:34:33.80 --> 00:34:36.80
You better put that throttle fully down again.

430
00:34:36.80 --> 00:34:41.80
You better start making things happen because they're not going to happen on their own.

431
00:34:41.80 --> 00:34:51.80
So that's good. Be a doer, be a self starter, be aggressive, take initiative, but just straight up.

432
00:34:51.80 --> 00:34:53.80
Put your feet up and think about what you're doing.

433
00:34:53.80 --> 00:34:55.80
So there you go. That's number two.

434
00:34:55.80 --> 00:35:01.80
Number three, strive for self improvement through constant self evaluation.

435
00:35:01.80 --> 00:35:11.80
This is a good rule for leadership and life.

436
00:35:11.80 --> 00:35:17.80
And it's it's weird to think that number one, if you're not humble, you're not doing this, right?

437
00:35:17.80 --> 00:35:19.80
If you're not, if you think you're doing everything right, you're not doing this.

438
00:35:19.80 --> 00:35:20.80
This is just isn't happening.

439
00:35:20.80 --> 00:35:24.80
You have to be looking, you have to be humble enough to say what kind do better.

440
00:35:24.80 --> 00:35:27.80
And you have to start off by doing where you are.

441
00:35:27.80 --> 00:35:34.80
And then trying to assess what you can get, what you can get better at.

442
00:35:34.80 --> 00:35:37.80
And this is a difficult thing to do.

443
00:35:37.80 --> 00:35:42.80
And this is, you know, to me, this is the aminally qualified human, you know,

444
00:35:42.80 --> 00:35:49.80
the, the actual evaluation of yourself, which you and I wrote that book, the, the code evaluation, the protocol.

445
00:35:49.80 --> 00:35:51.80
And then made the app.

446
00:35:51.80 --> 00:35:52.80
There's an app for it.

447
00:35:52.80 --> 00:35:55.80
But that's the kind of thing where you go, okay, I know what I'm at right now.

448
00:35:55.80 --> 00:35:57.80
I know what I need to do today.

449
00:35:57.80 --> 00:35:59.80
I know where I slacked off a little bit.

450
00:35:59.80 --> 00:36:01.80
I know where I can improve tomorrow.

451
00:36:01.80 --> 00:36:06.80
And if you're not doing that, that's what, that's how Rome fell apart, right?

452
00:36:06.80 --> 00:36:08.80
Rome wasn't built in the day and it didn't fall apart in the day.

453
00:36:08.80 --> 00:36:10.80
You didn't fall apart a little bit at a time.

454
00:36:10.80 --> 00:36:12.80
It's a little bit at a time.

455
00:36:12.80 --> 00:36:15.80
That's what happens.

456
00:36:15.80 --> 00:36:19.80
That's the self evaluation comment.

457
00:36:19.80 --> 00:36:24.80
And obviously immediately tethered that to the idea of humility is such an important piece of that,

458
00:36:24.80 --> 00:36:30.80
because, and I would see this all the time is, I would work with the guys that were good at certain things

459
00:36:30.80 --> 00:36:32.80
and not good at other things.

460
00:36:32.80 --> 00:36:37.80
And where they would spend their focus would be doing the things they did well.

461
00:36:37.80 --> 00:36:42.80
Which is important, and this is not to say that if you don't have a particular strength that you shouldn't focus on that strength.

462
00:36:42.80 --> 00:36:47.80
But because they were comfortable doing the things they were good at, they spent all their time doing the things they were good at.

463
00:36:47.80 --> 00:36:50.80
And you got more experience and more senior.

464
00:36:50.80 --> 00:36:55.80
The more those other gaps became a big hindrance, because you have to be good at a lot of things,

465
00:36:55.80 --> 00:36:57.80
especially in a leadership role.

466
00:36:57.80 --> 00:37:02.80
As you see, if you play on elevating in that leadership role, the awareness of, hey, if I'm not good at this,

467
00:37:02.80 --> 00:37:07.80
I have to spend time doing the things and getting better things I'm not as good at as I should be.

468
00:37:07.80 --> 00:37:09.80
And how easy it is to go, well, I'm pretty good at this.

469
00:37:09.80 --> 00:37:12.80
I'm just going to stay over here because this is so much easier for me,

470
00:37:12.80 --> 00:37:16.80
and not being willing to acknowledge what you're not good at,

471
00:37:16.80 --> 00:37:18.80
and actually spend some time working on that.

472
00:37:18.80 --> 00:37:21.80
And how easy it is to fall in the trap of, well, I'm good at this.

473
00:37:21.80 --> 00:37:22.80
I suck at this.

474
00:37:22.80 --> 00:37:24.80
What's your one, should I be working on today?

475
00:37:24.80 --> 00:37:26.80
I'll just keep doing this thing over here.

476
00:37:26.80 --> 00:37:30.80
And that self, the self evaluation of what do I know, I'm not good at,

477
00:37:30.80 --> 00:37:34.80
and how easily we can just ignore what we know we need to be working on.

478
00:37:34.80 --> 00:37:38.80
I used to hate being on the bottom in due to, like someone on top.

479
00:37:38.80 --> 00:37:40.80
It was just like smash, and I would hate the feeling, right?

480
00:37:40.80 --> 00:37:44.80
And so for months, the only place I started was with people across the side of Mounted Army.

481
00:37:44.80 --> 00:37:49.80
I was like, I have to take it, and then just got over it completely,

482
00:37:49.80 --> 00:37:52.80
where it literally didn't matter anymore.

483
00:37:52.80 --> 00:37:55.80
If you don't have that approach, you're going to have problems.

484
00:37:55.80 --> 00:37:58.80
I'm going to have problems, watch out for that.

485
00:37:58.80 --> 00:38:00.80
And this is tied into the next one number four,

486
00:38:00.80 --> 00:38:02.80
which is never be satisfied.

487
00:38:02.80 --> 00:38:04.80
Ask of any project, how can it be done better?

488
00:38:04.80 --> 00:38:11.80
Now listen, you know, you could just, just to throw like a different perspective on this,

489
00:38:11.80 --> 00:38:15.80
or a different angle, the never be satisfied thing, where all of a sudden,

490
00:38:15.80 --> 00:38:20.80
you know, I've never satisfied, and I'm, you know, freaking out about and constantly.

491
00:38:20.80 --> 00:38:26.80
There's people that that run into issues with that, where they can't, like chill out

492
00:38:26.80 --> 00:38:30.80
and back off and detach and look around and see what's happening.

493
00:38:30.80 --> 00:38:33.80
So never is kind of a strong word.

494
00:38:33.80 --> 00:38:39.80
But at the same time, this is completely tied to humility, because if you are satisfied,

495
00:38:39.80 --> 00:38:46.80
that's an indicator that maybe you think you're there and you're not, you're not.

496
00:38:46.80 --> 00:38:53.80
This implies that the debriefs to me, you know, it's like not being satisfied with it,

497
00:38:53.80 --> 00:38:57.80
by looking back at it and saying, hey, how could we do this better?

498
00:38:57.80 --> 00:38:59.80
Did we miss anything?

499
00:38:59.80 --> 00:39:02.80
Is there something we should add to this and then debriefing it,

500
00:39:02.80 --> 00:39:05.80
and then trying to, you know, trying to get them to the next evolution?

501
00:39:05.80 --> 00:39:06.80
Yeah, 100%.

502
00:39:06.80 --> 00:39:09.80
If you're not debriefing what you're doing, and then, and look,

503
00:39:09.80 --> 00:39:13.80
if you want to take that to a really good personal level,

504
00:39:13.80 --> 00:39:17.80
if you look at your day, that's what's nice about the EQH app.

505
00:39:17.80 --> 00:39:20.80
So if you look at your day and you're like, oh, I could have done this better.

506
00:39:20.80 --> 00:39:22.80
It's just at the end of the day gone.

507
00:39:22.80 --> 00:39:25.80
Hmm, did I really, I didn't really do that.

508
00:39:25.80 --> 00:39:28.80
I, I, I got it on that donut or whatever,

509
00:39:28.80 --> 00:39:31.80
tapped this, my, my daughters right now, they say tapped it,

510
00:39:31.80 --> 00:39:34.80
like, we've talked about food, they're like, oh, can I tap into that?

511
00:39:34.80 --> 00:39:37.80
So you might have accidentally tapped into a donut or whatever, right?

512
00:39:37.80 --> 00:39:39.80
You're going to watch out.

513
00:39:39.80 --> 00:39:42.80
So, which, by the way, I don't think I can ever eat a donut again,

514
00:39:42.80 --> 00:39:45.80
because I've talked so much smack about donuts.

515
00:39:45.80 --> 00:39:49.80
And I think there's someone with like a 600 millimeter lens stock in the way,

516
00:39:49.80 --> 00:39:50.80
and then see that donut.

517
00:39:50.80 --> 00:39:52.80
Go down that.

518
00:39:52.80 --> 00:39:53.80
Ain't happening.

519
00:39:53.80 --> 00:39:57.80
But doing a debrief with yourself at the end of the day,

520
00:39:57.80 --> 00:40:01.80
what did I, and then, and then also creating what you're going to do tomorrow

521
00:40:01.80 --> 00:40:03.80
to focus on the weaknesses a little bit.

522
00:40:03.80 --> 00:40:05.80
And again, like you said, Dave,

523
00:40:05.80 --> 00:40:10.80
Dave wasn't like, hey, you know, I'm going to focus on my piano skills,

524
00:40:10.80 --> 00:40:14.80
because he's not that great at piano when he's supposed to be a jet fighter pilot, right?

525
00:40:14.80 --> 00:40:15.80
Right, I get it.

526
00:40:15.80 --> 00:40:19.80
But doesn't mean you shouldn't understand the music or something.

527
00:40:19.80 --> 00:40:20.80
You know what I'm saying?

528
00:40:20.80 --> 00:40:22.80
Doesn't mean you shouldn't go out and get that get box.

529
00:40:22.80 --> 00:40:25.80
Oh, all right.

530
00:40:25.80 --> 00:40:30.80
Number five, don't over inspect or oversupervised.

531
00:40:30.80 --> 00:40:33.80
Just allow your leaders to make mistakes in training,

532
00:40:33.80 --> 00:40:38.80
so they can profit from their errors and not make them in combat.

533
00:40:38.80 --> 00:40:43.80
So decentralized command, clearly is what we're talking about here.

534
00:40:43.80 --> 00:40:50.80
And it's incredible how annoying over inspection and over supervision is to humans.

535
00:40:50.80 --> 00:40:52.80
That's psychological reactants, right?

536
00:40:52.80 --> 00:40:55.80
It's like psychological reactants, which means we don't want to be told what to do,

537
00:40:55.80 --> 00:40:56.80
because we're human beings.

538
00:40:56.80 --> 00:40:59.80
We have a psychological rejection of people that are trying to control us.

539
00:40:59.80 --> 00:41:00.80
That's normal.

540
00:41:00.80 --> 00:41:01.80
That's common.

541
00:41:01.80 --> 00:41:08.80
But over inspection and over supervision just triggers the psychological reactants all day long.

542
00:41:08.80 --> 00:41:09.80
All day long.

543
00:41:09.80 --> 00:41:10.80
Don't let it happen.

544
00:41:10.80 --> 00:41:14.80
Don't be that leader, because that's not going to work out good for you.

545
00:41:14.80 --> 00:41:16.80
It's not your team's not going to like it.

546
00:41:16.80 --> 00:41:17.80
No one's going to like it.

547
00:41:17.80 --> 00:41:22.80
Now, here's where people get a little bit wary about this, because they think,

548
00:41:22.80 --> 00:41:25.80
well, you know, I'm in the business world.

549
00:41:25.80 --> 00:41:31.80
And so I don't have the luxury of being able to train someone to in a training situation.

550
00:41:31.80 --> 00:41:33.80
No, they got to go in front of a client.

551
00:41:33.80 --> 00:41:37.80
I can't just let them fail in training, because there's no such thing.

552
00:41:37.80 --> 00:41:38.80
We don't do that.

553
00:41:38.80 --> 00:41:39.80
We don't have time.

554
00:41:39.80 --> 00:41:42.80
I don't have six months getting ready to go on to pulling me to work with the client.

555
00:41:42.80 --> 00:41:43.80
No, we're working the client today.

556
00:41:43.80 --> 00:41:47.80
So there are multiple ways of doing this, right?

557
00:41:47.80 --> 00:41:51.80
If Dave has got to eat Dave's not experience in a certain type of project.

558
00:41:51.80 --> 00:41:55.80
And I go, okay, Dave, you're going to take lead on this project.

559
00:41:55.80 --> 00:41:56.80
Want it.

560
00:41:56.80 --> 00:42:01.80
You come up with, you know, your initial, your initial brief on the timeline you want to use.

561
00:42:01.80 --> 00:42:02.80
And he puts together the timeline.

562
00:42:02.80 --> 00:42:04.80
I don't send him to the client with it.

563
00:42:04.80 --> 00:42:05.80
I say, okay, now brief me on it.

564
00:42:05.80 --> 00:42:09.80
And he's like, I got 30 days to talk about cover move.

565
00:42:09.80 --> 00:42:10.80
And I go, no, it says make me sense.

566
00:42:10.80 --> 00:42:15.80
So you can actually train and educate someone just by putting in a little,

567
00:42:15.80 --> 00:42:17.80
probably 20% extra effort.

568
00:42:17.80 --> 00:42:20.80
And if you think about it, it's actually probably a break even because I didn't have to do

569
00:42:20.80 --> 00:42:22.80
the bulk of the work myself.

570
00:42:22.80 --> 00:42:26.80
I just said, hey, Dave, come up with a timeline for this training schedule for this client.

571
00:42:26.80 --> 00:42:27.80
And he goes, oh, cool.

572
00:42:27.80 --> 00:42:29.80
And he goes and does it.

573
00:42:29.80 --> 00:42:31.80
Now, if I would have had to do it, I would have made couple phone calls.

574
00:42:31.80 --> 00:42:33.80
No, I would have to do the pull out the word processor.

575
00:42:33.80 --> 00:42:35.80
And I would have to sit down and do it.

576
00:42:35.80 --> 00:42:36.80
And it would have been pain.

577
00:42:36.80 --> 00:42:38.80
And plus I would have been in the weeds on it.

578
00:42:38.80 --> 00:42:40.80
So I don't really see as much.

579
00:42:40.80 --> 00:42:41.80
I'm not the attach from it.

580
00:42:41.80 --> 00:42:43.80
Instead, I go, hey, Dave, come up with a timeline for this client.

581
00:42:43.80 --> 00:42:44.80
What you want to do for a basic schedule.

582
00:42:44.80 --> 00:42:45.80
And he goes, cool, got it.

583
00:42:45.80 --> 00:42:46.80
He does it.

584
00:42:46.80 --> 00:42:47.80
He's never done it before.

585
00:42:47.80 --> 00:42:49.80
Or maybe just, I go, here's an old client.

586
00:42:49.80 --> 00:42:50.80
Similar client.

587
00:42:50.80 --> 00:42:52.80
You can use this as a, as a guide.

588
00:42:52.80 --> 00:42:53.80
Cool.

589
00:42:53.80 --> 00:42:54.80
He does it.

590
00:42:54.80 --> 00:42:55.80
It's pretty close, right?

591
00:42:55.80 --> 00:42:56.80
It doesn't.

592
00:42:56.80 --> 00:42:58.80
I'm not wasting a bunch of time.

593
00:42:58.80 --> 00:43:03.80
And if he was a total idiot, and you produce something that sucked, I'd be like, okay, cool, this is what this is horrible.

594
00:43:03.80 --> 00:43:04.80
This is why.

595
00:43:04.80 --> 00:43:05.80
Didn't cost us anything.

596
00:43:05.80 --> 00:43:06.80
Didn't put any risk.

597
00:43:06.80 --> 00:43:09.80
Didn't show the client some bad take on us.

598
00:43:09.80 --> 00:43:11.80
No, it's all good.

599
00:43:11.80 --> 00:43:16.80
So just because we use the, just because the term is used here.

600
00:43:16.80 --> 00:43:19.80
You're making mistakes in training.

601
00:43:19.80 --> 00:43:24.80
Don't consider training to be this official thing where you've been pulled away and you don't have any interaction in the real world.

602
00:43:24.80 --> 00:43:28.80
No, training can happen every single day with everything that you do.

603
00:43:28.80 --> 00:43:29.80
And that's what you should do.

604
00:43:29.80 --> 00:43:31.80
And you should let people brush up against the guardrails of failure.

605
00:43:31.80 --> 00:43:33.80
You should let people do that.

606
00:43:33.80 --> 00:43:35.80
And then when they do, you don't jump down their throat.

607
00:43:35.80 --> 00:43:37.80
And now you don't become a micromanager.

608
00:43:37.80 --> 00:43:40.80
You make adjustments and you set another thing for.

609
00:43:40.80 --> 00:43:42.80
Say, all right, here's, hey, Dave, this doesn't make any sense.

610
00:43:42.80 --> 00:43:45.80
I just, this is, will never take this much time.

611
00:43:45.80 --> 00:43:47.80
Go make some adjustments and bring it back to me.

612
00:43:47.80 --> 00:43:48.80
Dave does it and cool.

613
00:43:48.80 --> 00:43:49.80
That, yep, good to go.

614
00:43:49.80 --> 00:43:51.80
My net investment at time is probably the same.

615
00:43:51.80 --> 00:43:53.80
If not, I'm probably saving time.

616
00:43:53.80 --> 00:43:57.80
And my product, my end product is actually better because I'm detached.

617
00:43:57.80 --> 00:44:02.80
And I wasn't in the weeds on the initial assignment.

618
00:44:02.80 --> 00:44:05.80
So don't over inspect.

619
00:44:05.80 --> 00:44:08.80
Don't over supervise hard to do that.

620
00:44:08.80 --> 00:44:10.80
Your ego wants you to over supervise.

621
00:44:10.80 --> 00:44:12.80
By the way, your ego wants to over inspect.

622
00:44:12.80 --> 00:44:16.80
Your ego actually wants to find problems you ever had those bosses.

623
00:44:16.80 --> 00:44:19.80
They, you can't get through a, like in the seal teams.

624
00:44:19.80 --> 00:44:20.80
You give a brief.

625
00:44:20.80 --> 00:44:23.80
There's no way you're getting through the brief without getting

626
00:44:23.80 --> 00:44:26.80
Dinged on seven different things.

627
00:44:26.80 --> 00:44:29.80
I'd like some of the guys I used to critique their briefs on coming

628
00:44:29.80 --> 00:44:32.80
Talk to me because I was freaking harsh on those briefs.

629
00:44:32.80 --> 00:44:34.80
But here's the thing, man.

630
00:44:34.80 --> 00:44:37.80
I'll have to review some of my notes because I would be harsh

631
00:44:37.80 --> 00:44:40.80
because they would do dumb shit.

632
00:44:40.80 --> 00:44:42.80
And I'd be like, bro, what are you doing over here?

633
00:44:42.80 --> 00:44:43.80
What does this mean?

634
00:44:43.80 --> 00:44:45.80
I can't even understand, look at your pictures here.

635
00:44:45.80 --> 00:44:46.80
Like this doesn't make any sense.

636
00:44:46.80 --> 00:44:47.80
What is this timeline?

637
00:44:47.80 --> 00:44:49.80
How do you think you're going to patrol from here to here in that amount of time?

638
00:44:49.80 --> 00:44:52.80
They were just legitimate things.

639
00:44:52.80 --> 00:44:54.80
Because I actually didn't care.

640
00:44:54.80 --> 00:44:57.80
I actually didn't care what the font was.

641
00:44:57.80 --> 00:44:58.80
I didn't care about any of that.

642
00:44:58.80 --> 00:44:59.80
I cared about.

643
00:44:59.80 --> 00:45:01.80
And actually, I did, here's a good case in point.

644
00:45:01.80 --> 00:45:03.80
I had a guy, good dude.

645
00:45:03.80 --> 00:45:05.80
Tora's brief up.

646
00:45:05.80 --> 00:45:08.80
And, you know, he gets done.

647
00:45:08.80 --> 00:45:10.80
They do another brief next day.

648
00:45:10.80 --> 00:45:11.80
Next stop.

649
00:45:11.80 --> 00:45:12.80
Tora it up.

650
00:45:12.80 --> 00:45:13.80
Terrible.

651
00:45:13.80 --> 00:45:16.80
And he's like, after the first day, he added even more.

652
00:45:16.80 --> 00:45:18.80
Like trying to satisfy me.

653
00:45:18.80 --> 00:45:21.80
And he says, dude, what this is like a moving target.

654
00:45:21.80 --> 00:45:23.80
What is that you're actually want from these briefs?

655
00:45:23.80 --> 00:45:26.80
And I said, well, it's not a moving target.

656
00:45:26.80 --> 00:45:31.80
I said, to me, a good brief is when you give a brief,

657
00:45:31.80 --> 00:45:36.80
your men understand the mission and the execution.

658
00:45:36.80 --> 00:45:42.80
And he was like, okay, fair enough.

659
00:45:42.80 --> 00:45:47.80
And then he took that to heart of, okay, my audience is not

660
00:45:47.80 --> 00:45:48.80
Jocco.

661
00:45:48.80 --> 00:45:49.80
My audience is not the commanding officer.

662
00:45:49.80 --> 00:45:51.80
My audience is my machine gunner.

663
00:45:51.80 --> 00:45:52.80
My audience is my point man.

664
00:45:52.80 --> 00:45:53.80
My audience is my preacher.

665
00:45:53.80 --> 00:45:54.80
That's my audience.

666
00:45:54.80 --> 00:45:56.80
That's who needs to understand this thing.

667
00:45:56.80 --> 00:45:57.80
And that's the way it's supposed to be.

668
00:45:57.80 --> 00:46:00.80
And that's the same, same thing, life, and I wrote about this.

669
00:46:00.80 --> 00:46:01.80
Happen with life and stuff.

670
00:46:01.80 --> 00:46:06.80
And so I've left and stuff we're doing the freaking most insane 150

671
00:46:06.80 --> 00:46:11.80
Slide PowerPoint briefs for reconnaissance missions in training.

672
00:46:11.80 --> 00:46:12.80
And they were so bad.

673
00:46:12.80 --> 00:46:17.80
And I was like, hey, guys, no one knows what the hell you guys are talking about.

674
00:46:17.80 --> 00:46:18.80
I said, let's do this.

675
00:46:18.80 --> 00:46:22.80
I said, I just want you to brief to the lowest common denominator in your

676
00:46:22.80 --> 00:46:23.80
Patoon, just do that.

677
00:46:23.80 --> 00:46:24.80
Pull out a map.

678
00:46:24.80 --> 00:46:26.80
Don't put a bunch of slides.

679
00:46:26.80 --> 00:46:28.80
They don't need to have animation in the slides.

680
00:46:28.80 --> 00:46:31.80
You know, much time it takes to do animation in the slide.

681
00:46:31.80 --> 00:46:34.80
I mean, it's a total waste of time.

682
00:46:34.80 --> 00:46:36.80
It's a total waste of time.

683
00:46:36.80 --> 00:46:39.80
You should pull up the map and be like, hey, we're going to move from here to here.

684
00:46:39.80 --> 00:46:40.80
That's the way it's going to work.

685
00:46:40.80 --> 00:46:41.80
Follow my finger.

686
00:46:41.80 --> 00:46:43.80
Follow my pointer on this map.

687
00:46:43.80 --> 00:46:45.80
So you all know what's up.

688
00:46:45.80 --> 00:46:49.80
And said, we spend an extra hour and 22 minutes making humvies.

689
00:46:49.80 --> 00:46:52.80
Drive down a route in an animated way.

690
00:46:52.80 --> 00:46:53.80
It's a bit strange.

691
00:46:53.80 --> 00:46:55.80
And the cool thing was, and props to my audience.

692
00:46:55.80 --> 00:47:00.80
Those guys, and you guys have heard the story like Seth was like, we're going to get fired.

693
00:47:00.80 --> 00:47:03.80
And I said, hey, you will not get fired.

694
00:47:03.80 --> 00:47:06.80
If anyone gets fired, I will say this was 100% on me.

695
00:47:06.80 --> 00:47:07.80
I told him, brief this way.

696
00:47:07.80 --> 00:47:08.80
Don't worry about it.

697
00:47:08.80 --> 00:47:10.80
Brief to your lowest common denominator.

698
00:47:10.80 --> 00:47:11.80
Brief to your machine gunners.

699
00:47:11.80 --> 00:47:12.80
And they're like, okay.

700
00:47:12.80 --> 00:47:14.80
And sure enough, the commanding officer came up.

701
00:47:14.80 --> 00:47:15.80
He sat through the brief and tears credit.

702
00:47:15.80 --> 00:47:18.80
He was like, that was the best briefs we've had.

703
00:47:18.80 --> 00:47:20.80
I actually understand what's happening.

704
00:47:20.80 --> 00:47:22.80
I'm like, that's the goal.

705
00:47:22.80 --> 00:47:25.80
So that's what we need to do.

706
00:47:25.80 --> 00:47:28.80
Don't over supervise.

707
00:47:28.80 --> 00:47:29.80
Don't over inspect.

708
00:47:29.80 --> 00:47:32.80
And with people make mistakes, just make some little adjustments.

709
00:47:32.80 --> 00:47:33.80
Tell them what the goal is.

710
00:47:33.80 --> 00:47:36.80
And we're going to be alright.

711
00:47:36.80 --> 00:47:37.80
Yeah.

712
00:47:37.80 --> 00:47:38.80
I'm just cracking out listening.

713
00:47:38.80 --> 00:47:42.80
Do you tell these stories and just kind of put my version of that and my experience.

714
00:47:42.80 --> 00:47:44.80
But I think also want to leadership role.

715
00:47:44.80 --> 00:47:45.80
Doesn't matter if you're the military.

716
00:47:45.80 --> 00:47:49.80
Doesn't matter if you're the private sector and whether you're trying to

717
00:47:49.80 --> 00:47:53.80
a real world.

718
00:47:53.80 --> 00:47:55.80
You also have to know what matters.

719
00:47:55.80 --> 00:47:58.80
You got to know what really matters and what really doesn't.

720
00:47:58.80 --> 00:48:03.80
And something we saw in the military that I know transfers over would drive people nuts

721
00:48:03.80 --> 00:48:09.80
is if you're in a key leadership role and you're getting this brief and you make a comment about the font.

722
00:48:09.80 --> 00:48:10.80
Guess what?

723
00:48:10.80 --> 00:48:12.80
Those people all downstream you.

724
00:48:12.80 --> 00:48:14.80
They're going to obsess over the font.

725
00:48:14.80 --> 00:48:18.80
So if it really doesn't matter, don't say anything about it because what you're going to do is

726
00:48:18.80 --> 00:48:19.80
make you happy.

727
00:48:19.80 --> 00:48:21.80
They're trying to give you what they think you want.

728
00:48:21.80 --> 00:48:25.80
And if you're the guy that wants to think out loud, go boy, you know,

729
00:48:25.80 --> 00:48:27.80
courier is way better than times.

730
00:48:27.80 --> 00:48:28.80
Isn't it?

731
00:48:28.80 --> 00:48:31.80
Every single slide is not going to get reviewed.

732
00:48:31.80 --> 00:48:35.80
Three layers downstream of someone trying to make sure, oh,

733
00:48:35.80 --> 00:48:38.80
Dave's real obsessed about the font.

734
00:48:38.80 --> 00:48:39.80
Even if you're not.

735
00:48:39.80 --> 00:48:42.80
But if you want to make a point of that, if you decide to bring that up,

736
00:48:42.80 --> 00:48:43.80
your people are going to try to satisfy you.

737
00:48:43.80 --> 00:48:44.80
That's what I'm trying to do.

738
00:48:44.80 --> 00:48:47.80
So be real careful about what matters and don't talk about the things that don't

739
00:48:47.80 --> 00:48:50.80
matter because they're going to hear you and they're going to want to fix that

740
00:48:50.80 --> 00:48:52.80
when in your mind.

741
00:48:52.80 --> 00:48:54.80
It isn't even an important thing.

742
00:48:54.80 --> 00:48:56.80
But once you say it, it's out there.

743
00:48:56.80 --> 00:48:57.80
That's what people are going to get.

744
00:48:57.80 --> 00:48:58.80
We saw that in the military all the time.

745
00:48:58.80 --> 00:49:00.80
Oh, this, uh, we're breathing this general.

746
00:49:00.80 --> 00:49:02.80
His real big on on spacing.

747
00:49:02.80 --> 00:49:04.80
And I bet you if you grabbed that general,

748
00:49:04.80 --> 00:49:06.80
hey, general, um, we have to spend three hours fixing this spacing on the

749
00:49:06.80 --> 00:49:08.80
spree if you want us to do that.

750
00:49:08.80 --> 00:49:09.80
He would say no.

751
00:49:09.80 --> 00:49:10.80
We're giving get that.

752
00:49:10.80 --> 00:49:10.80
Yeah.

753
00:49:10.80 --> 00:49:12.80
But he made a comment or it came out.

754
00:49:12.80 --> 00:49:13.80
Yeah.

755
00:49:13.80 --> 00:49:16.80
And the worst thing is you got people that are focused on that instead of focusing on that.

756
00:49:16.80 --> 00:49:21.80
And focusing on the content of a mission totally and a good plan and contingency plans.

757
00:49:21.80 --> 00:49:24.80
So all the time.

758
00:49:24.80 --> 00:49:27.80
So be careful that.

759
00:49:27.80 --> 00:49:29.80
Number six.

760
00:49:29.80 --> 00:49:32.80
Keep the troops informed.

761
00:49:32.80 --> 00:49:36.80
Telling them what, how and why builds their confidence.

762
00:49:36.80 --> 00:49:39.80
It was an interesting, an interesting little twist on that, right?

763
00:49:39.80 --> 00:49:41.80
Builds their confidence.

764
00:49:41.80 --> 00:49:45.80
First of all, let's us know the importance of people being confident, being confident

765
00:49:45.80 --> 00:49:48.80
and and look when you when you know what you're doing,

766
00:49:48.80 --> 00:49:51.80
but you don't know why that's a problem for your confidence.

767
00:49:51.80 --> 00:49:53.80
You don't even know why you're doing it.

768
00:49:53.80 --> 00:49:54.80
She's a fron.

769
00:49:54.80 --> 00:49:59.80
If you know why you're doing something, but you don't know what you're doing it for, that's the same thing.

770
00:49:59.80 --> 00:50:02.80
So keeping people informed.

771
00:50:02.80 --> 00:50:03.80
Heh.

772
00:50:03.80 --> 00:50:05.80
A lack of info.

773
00:50:05.80 --> 00:50:09.80
And this was, this was one of the reasons why I was very happy.

774
00:50:09.80 --> 00:50:11.80
Look, and I was very lucky in my career.

775
00:50:11.80 --> 00:50:14.80
I was very lucky in my career that I did my career the way I did.

776
00:50:14.80 --> 00:50:18.80
Then I'm not saying that there's a bunch of better ways to do it because there's certainly our but for me.

777
00:50:18.80 --> 00:50:20.80
What, what was very nice for me.

778
00:50:20.80 --> 00:50:28.80
One of the huge lessons that I learned was how horrible it feels not to know what's happening.

779
00:50:28.80 --> 00:50:36.80
And the team normally doesn't know what you think they know.

780
00:50:36.80 --> 00:50:38.80
They don't.

781
00:50:38.80 --> 00:50:39.80
Do you think they know stuff?

782
00:50:39.80 --> 00:50:40.80
They don't know it.

783
00:50:40.80 --> 00:50:41.80
You think that they understand things.

784
00:50:41.80 --> 00:50:42.80
They don't.

785
00:50:42.80 --> 00:50:44.80
That's not because they're not stupid.

786
00:50:44.80 --> 00:50:48.80
Because they don't have the visibility on the things that you have the visibility on.

787
00:50:48.80 --> 00:50:54.80
So it's, it's very important to tell people what's going on.

788
00:50:54.80 --> 00:51:00.80
And by the way, and this is, it's so crystal clear in this field teams, but it's crystal clear in the world.

789
00:51:00.80 --> 00:51:05.80
But the seal teams was just so, so epic at doing this.

790
00:51:05.80 --> 00:51:09.80
Anything that the two troops didn't know they were going to make up their own.

791
00:51:09.80 --> 00:51:13.80
And it was going to be like the worst possible case scenario every single time.

792
00:51:13.80 --> 00:51:17.80
You know, oh, the, what heading back early?

793
00:51:17.80 --> 00:51:19.80
Oh, we're heading back from this trip early.

794
00:51:19.80 --> 00:51:22.80
You know, you're probably going because the aircraft got rescheduled and so you're going to head back to the people like,

795
00:51:22.80 --> 00:51:23.80
Oh, no.

796
00:51:23.80 --> 00:51:26.80
See our platoon's getting disbanded.

797
00:51:26.80 --> 00:51:28.80
You know, we, whatever.

798
00:51:28.80 --> 00:51:29.80
They just go wild.

799
00:51:29.80 --> 00:51:33.80
So when you don't tell people what's going on, they're going to make it up.

800
00:51:33.80 --> 00:51:34.80
And that's going to be bad.

801
00:51:34.80 --> 00:51:38.80
And it, and it, and it, and one of the worst feelings in the world is to not know what's happening.

802
00:51:38.80 --> 00:51:43.80
And as part of a team, and it, look, this doesn't mean you have to submit a

803
00:51:43.80 --> 00:51:49.80
19 page PowerPoint brief, especially if you can get people the context and the context.

804
00:51:49.80 --> 00:51:55.80
You know, if every day or every couple days, you're giving the context of, or people have the context.

805
00:51:55.80 --> 00:51:57.80
Now my brief doesn't have to be that long.

806
00:51:57.80 --> 00:51:59.80
It's like, hey, carry, we're actually going to move to this position.

807
00:51:59.80 --> 00:52:01.80
You're like, okay, cool, because I know that here's where we were.

808
00:52:01.80 --> 00:52:02.80
Here's where we were going.

809
00:52:02.80 --> 00:52:05.80
If I just, you don't know, have any context.

810
00:52:05.80 --> 00:52:14.80
And I tell you, we're moving here. I have to actually take now 20 minutes to explain how we got to the point where we're going to go there.

811
00:52:14.80 --> 00:52:17.80
To keep that in mind.

812
00:52:17.80 --> 00:52:25.80
Number seven, the heart of the training, the more the troops will brag.

813
00:52:25.80 --> 00:52:30.80
The harder the training, the more the troops will brag.

814
00:52:30.80 --> 00:52:40.80
Clearly, this is seen in the military and almost to a detriment, of course, because people you can put people through so much training and they can start to brag so much.

815
00:52:40.80 --> 00:52:42.80
That's not to believe it.

816
00:52:42.80 --> 00:52:50.80
Lafoys talks about the fact when we started tasked a bruiser and we're working together and we were going to do an extra.

817
00:52:50.80 --> 00:52:52.80
We were coming in early in the morning.

818
00:52:52.80 --> 00:52:54.80
We were staying later at night.

819
00:52:54.80 --> 00:52:57.80
We were doing extra iterations of the training that we were being told to do.

820
00:52:57.80 --> 00:53:00.80
The training cadre would leave and we'd stay there and do more.

821
00:53:00.80 --> 00:53:02.80
And the initial take was,

822
00:53:02.80 --> 00:53:04.80
We were doing a pool, we were going to go, we're going to do this.

823
00:53:04.80 --> 00:53:07.80
Sure, that was the kind of initial take.

824
00:53:07.80 --> 00:53:21.80
And sure enough, as we got better, as we got more square to away, as we started getting huge compliments from the training cadre, all of a sudden that that.

825
00:53:21.80 --> 00:53:26.80
Bitching turned to bragging, which was pretty cool.

826
00:53:26.80 --> 00:53:31.80
And it's the thing is though, there's a speed bump that you have to get over.

827
00:53:31.80 --> 00:53:34.80
Right? There's a speed bump. There's a point in time.

828
00:53:34.80 --> 00:53:40.80
There's an intersection of time where you're working harder, but you're not seeing any benefits from it.

829
00:53:40.80 --> 00:53:43.80
You're working harder, but no one really else can see it.

830
00:53:43.80 --> 00:53:47.80
You're working hard, you're doing extra, but there's no real benefit.

831
00:53:47.80 --> 00:53:51.80
And you've got to get to the speed bump, so you're going to get people being negative.

832
00:53:51.80 --> 00:53:53.80
This bill will get to work extra, we're going to do it.

833
00:53:53.80 --> 00:53:55.80
Coming early, well, good, stay late.

834
00:53:55.80 --> 00:54:02.80
I've got that isn't thing that you're going to have to overcome and get to the point where all of a sudden, oh, we just crushed this block of training.

835
00:54:02.80 --> 00:54:09.80
We just got huge compliments to our commanding officer about our performance in land warfare or whatever.

836
00:54:09.80 --> 00:54:12.80
And so you've got to get over that speed bump.

837
00:54:12.80 --> 00:54:17.80
So that the bragging can start and the pride can start.

838
00:54:17.80 --> 00:54:23.80
And then what you've got to be careful of is you've got to be careful that that pride doesn't get so big that people will go, you know, we don't need to do any more.

839
00:54:23.80 --> 00:54:25.80
We don't need to do this anymore.

840
00:54:25.80 --> 00:54:29.80
So keep that in mind and keep yourselves in check.

841
00:54:29.80 --> 00:54:41.80
You know, luckily we had friends in other task units because it got pretty, the kind of, the chest sticking out and task new pressure got a little bit much.

842
00:54:41.80 --> 00:54:57.80
And you know, we'd get like some of our friends and other tasks units would be like, you know, oh, BTF, you know, we're like, okay, we need to back off of the heads to chill out everybody, you know, so just just keep it in check a little bit.

843
00:54:57.80 --> 00:54:59.80
But there's this speed bump you got to get over.

844
00:54:59.80 --> 00:55:01.80
That's a real thing.

845
00:55:01.80 --> 00:55:07.80
Yeah, and I think there's a connection to the previous comment you made about the why is it that hard training,

846
00:55:07.80 --> 00:55:11.80
especially when they start to make the connection why hard training is important.

847
00:55:11.80 --> 00:55:18.80
If they know why they're doing it, their, your people will have so much more resilience and be able to tolerate so much more hard training.

848
00:55:18.80 --> 00:55:21.80
And if you're just out for just training hard, because that's how you are.

849
00:55:21.80 --> 00:55:26.80
And they can't make any connection to all this extra time, all this extra work that it doesn't lead to something.

850
00:55:26.80 --> 00:55:31.80
You will run into a problem, but if you can connect that why and then go, oh.

851
00:55:31.80 --> 00:55:35.80
This real little thing was so much easier.

852
00:55:35.80 --> 00:55:42.80
Now the willingness to work hard and track this or work hard and training or put it in the next your time, because they know why they're doing it and makes it so much easier down the road.

853
00:55:42.80 --> 00:55:48.80
Yeah, no doubt, like you said, going with the previous point keep the troops informed.

854
00:55:48.80 --> 00:55:55.80
If you're not informed the troops and you're just kicking the crap out of one of normal basis, this is not there's not going to be any pride, there's just going to be negativity.

855
00:55:55.80 --> 00:55:56.80
So.

856
00:55:56.80 --> 00:56:04.80
Be careful that number eight, enthusiasm, fairness and moral and physical courage.

857
00:56:04.80 --> 00:56:07.80
Four of the most important aspects of leadership.

858
00:56:07.80 --> 00:56:21.80
It is interesting enthusiasm out of the gate enthusiasm man, well, you know why that is, in my opinion, because that is so infectious to everybody else.

859
00:56:21.80 --> 00:56:30.80
And when you're enthusiastic about something, when someone on the team isn't enthusiastic, that can just, that can change the attitude of everyone on the team.

860
00:56:30.80 --> 00:56:38.80
If you as the leader enthusiastic, it's definitely going to help if you will as the leader are not enthusiastic about something, it's a disaster.

861
00:56:38.80 --> 00:56:41.80
And everyone's going to be.

862
00:56:41.80 --> 00:56:47.80
Just bummed out to be doing whatever, having a good time with stuff, then being enthusiastic.

863
00:56:47.80 --> 00:56:50.80
That's something and you know what's cool, you can fake that.

864
00:56:50.80 --> 00:56:52.80
You can fake that all day long. I did.

865
00:56:52.80 --> 00:56:56.80
I'd be like, this is some dumb shit. Hey, let's rock and roll. Like, you know what I mean?

866
00:56:56.80 --> 00:57:00.80
You got to just sometimes call it man, I'm going to be fired up for this.

867
00:57:00.80 --> 00:57:02.80
I'm going to take it to the next level. Watch. Let's go.

868
00:57:02.80 --> 00:57:07.80
And you're just having fun and pretty much you, you fool everyone else. Then you fool yourself and you're having a good time.

869
00:57:07.80 --> 00:57:10.80
Let's do it. Let's rock and roll.

870
00:57:10.80 --> 00:57:12.80
Fairness.

871
00:57:12.80 --> 00:57:16.80
Clearly, clearly, got to be fair about what you're doing.

872
00:57:16.80 --> 00:57:18.80
And then moral and physical courage.

873
00:57:18.80 --> 00:57:21.80
You know what's what's interesting on these two.

874
00:57:21.80 --> 00:57:33.80
I was thinking about it. You would think that moral courage would be the easier thing to have because you're not under the threat of physical harm, right?

875
00:57:33.80 --> 00:57:35.80
Because normally I think physical courage.

876
00:57:35.80 --> 00:57:40.80
I think you're risking some sort of physical injury.

877
00:57:40.80 --> 00:57:50.80
What's it want? But I think most of the time, we see I think we's more often see a failure of moral courage than physical courage.

878
00:57:50.80 --> 00:57:56.80
Why is that? I think it basically boils down to most of the time with moral courage.

879
00:57:56.80 --> 00:57:59.80
You have time to think about it.

880
00:57:59.80 --> 00:58:03.80
And physical courage, like, oh, there's something going on. I'm going to go to this right now.

881
00:58:03.80 --> 00:58:07.80
And even talking to guys that have done incredibly courageous thing.

882
00:58:07.80 --> 00:58:13.80
I remember Mike Fortin was on the podcast, Medal of Honor recipient, Vietnam seal.

883
00:58:13.80 --> 00:58:18.80
And I said, well, you know, were you scared when you didn't ready to, I forget what it was.

884
00:58:18.80 --> 00:58:27.80
When you were getting ready to run across this beach that's being, you know, just darted with machine gun fire and grab your buddy that you fought was dead.

885
00:58:27.80 --> 00:58:32.80
Were you scared? Did you hesitate? He's like, no, I didn't think about it. I just had to go.

886
00:58:32.80 --> 00:58:34.80
So can you have time to think about it?

887
00:58:34.80 --> 00:58:37.80
You know, it's just like, wow, that's what this is what I'm doing. I'm doing it now.

888
00:58:37.80 --> 00:58:39.80
And there's no time to think about it.

889
00:58:39.80 --> 00:58:48.80
The moral courage is like you have time to weigh out what's going to happen and what the consequence is going to be and what are people going to think and what are you going to think and how is it going to feel.

890
00:58:48.80 --> 00:58:59.80
And I think that's why oftentimes the moral courage can be harder to muster up because you have time to think about it, which is generally not fun.

891
00:58:59.80 --> 00:59:04.80
In the team dynamic, you know, moral courage in a team,

892
00:59:04.80 --> 00:59:16.80
especially if there's like social proof against you, right, the rest of the team thinks one thing and you think, you know, you're being morally courageous and that's not what the team thinks.

893
00:59:16.80 --> 00:59:23.80
That can put some some pressure on you as a individual now against the team and your views versus theirs.

894
00:59:23.80 --> 00:59:27.80
That's a little different dynamic as opposed to moral courage as an individual.

895
00:59:27.80 --> 00:59:31.80
I'm going to do the right thing because that's the right thing to do.

896
00:59:31.80 --> 00:59:35.80
But you throw that in a team dynamic, it gets a little little more difficult.

897
00:59:35.80 --> 00:59:42.80
Yeah, well, you better have and build really good relationships with people that way you don't get yourself into a predicament, right?

898
00:59:42.80 --> 00:59:51.80
The predicament that you get yourself into is, you know, Dave does something that's a little bit wrong, but I don't really know him that well and I'm like, well, you know, I don't really want to say anything.

899
00:59:51.80 --> 00:59:55.80
And then I basically now have said, hey, you're cool that what it what you did is cool.

900
00:59:55.80 --> 01:00:05.80
And now he does something a little bit further outside the box of what he should be doing. And now I'm like, wait a second now, this is this is going outside the box, but I still don't can't say anything to Dave about it.

901
01:00:05.80 --> 01:00:09.80
Haven't preempted anything and now Dave goes further outside the box.

902
01:00:09.80 --> 01:00:15.80
So by the time I'm like, I'm going to say something, well, now I've known about the four things that he did that were outside the box.

903
01:00:15.80 --> 01:00:22.80
I'm culpable as well now. So now all of a sudden, I got it, it's going to be, I totally screwed myself.

904
01:00:22.80 --> 01:00:35.80
Whereas if I see Dave leaning outside the box, and he'll, hey, Dave, hey, bro, what are you doing? Well, what are you doing with this? He's like, well, you know, something we can get away with and I go, man, would you really like that to be on the cover of, you know, the newspaper?

905
01:00:35.80 --> 01:00:43.80
He's like, well, maybe not. I mean, and look, I trust you and you trust me, but what about this guy over here and that guy over there and they're all going to know what's happening.

906
01:00:43.80 --> 01:00:51.80
This doesn't seem like a smart movement. So just having a, it just like, just like I always say about hard conversations that earlier you have that conversation, the easier it's going to be.

907
01:00:51.80 --> 01:00:58.80
You know, I, that's something that Dave talks about, you know, I said there's no coverups in Tasking Abuser. There's no coverups.

908
01:00:58.80 --> 01:01:01.80
There's no coverups. There's not covering anything up. If something happens, we're going to tell everyone what happened.

909
01:01:01.80 --> 01:01:06.80
If somebody gets shot, something, something goes down, there's no coverups. This is what we're doing.

910
01:01:06.80 --> 01:01:11.80
And right there, everyone kind of goes, okay, like I guess that's the way it's going to be.

911
01:01:11.80 --> 01:01:18.80
And there's no, there's no, you start stepping outside the box and it's like, hey, wait a second, I already told you this.

912
01:01:18.80 --> 01:01:25.80
So it makes the hard conversation easier out of the gate because everybody kind of knows, oh,

913
01:01:25.80 --> 01:01:31.80
John says there's no coverups. Okay, well, that we know where he stands, got it.

914
01:01:31.80 --> 01:01:38.80
And we won't try and, you know, push the envelope. And when we do push the envelope a little bit, we're getting, we're getting pushed back in there real quick.

915
01:01:38.80 --> 01:01:43.80
So I think that will help you with your moral courage.

916
01:01:43.80 --> 01:01:45.80
Number one, having relationships with people.

917
01:01:45.80 --> 01:01:51.80
Number two, having the hard conversations earlier. Because I'm way, you don't put yourself in that freaking terrible predicament.

918
01:01:51.80 --> 01:01:59.80
We're like, uh, Dave's in bezel, freaking $380,000 from whatever, you know, you're like, bro, what are you doing?

919
01:01:59.80 --> 01:02:03.80
And it's too late because I knew about it, but now I'm culpable.

920
01:02:03.80 --> 01:02:05.80
So let's not get there.

921
01:02:05.80 --> 01:02:08.80
Moral courage is easier earlier.

922
01:02:08.80 --> 01:02:11.80
Let people know where you're stand.

923
01:02:11.80 --> 01:02:19.80
Number nine, showmanship of vital technique of leadership.

924
01:02:19.80 --> 01:02:30.80
One of the things that isn't about face, I guess Colonel Glover Johns was like a crack shot.

925
01:02:30.80 --> 01:02:36.80
It's the super accurate shot and he'd walked down the range and like, let me see your rifle son.

926
01:02:36.80 --> 01:02:41.80
He'd say you got a quarter on you and you'd have them throw a quarter up in the air and he'd shoot the quarter.

927
01:02:41.80 --> 01:02:45.80
And he's like, prize possession to have a quarter that was shot by Glover Johns.

928
01:02:45.80 --> 01:02:50.80
These are kind of things that he did.

929
01:02:50.80 --> 01:02:58.80
So that's something that, you know, something that is good to be able to to show people.

930
01:02:58.80 --> 01:03:01.80
He got somebody in the sealed teams being able to shoot moving communicate.

931
01:03:01.80 --> 01:03:04.80
It's a good thing, you know, you got to be a good shot.

932
01:03:04.80 --> 01:03:08.80
You don't want to be a loser shot.

933
01:03:08.80 --> 01:03:10.80
You know, I was definitely never the best shot.

934
01:03:10.80 --> 01:03:11.80
I was usually fast.

935
01:03:11.80 --> 01:03:13.80
I was pretty fast out of the holster.

936
01:03:13.80 --> 01:03:18.80
So I could do well in a speed shooting, but then, you know, you get out some.

937
01:03:18.80 --> 01:03:21.80
The act, my accuracy wouldn't be as good as like our really good shooters.

938
01:03:21.80 --> 01:03:25.80
Guys, we're freaking really good, but shoot moving communicate.

939
01:03:25.80 --> 01:03:26.80
You know, are you in good shape?

940
01:03:26.80 --> 01:03:31.80
Can you, do, hey, if you're lagging, if you're in a leadership position, you're lagging on a patrol.

941
01:03:31.80 --> 01:03:34.80
Like you need your weight, you can't carry weight. That's a problem.

942
01:03:34.80 --> 01:03:38.80
Right? That's a problem. If you don't know how to work your radio, that's a problem.

943
01:03:38.80 --> 01:03:41.80
These are just like little things, right?

944
01:03:41.80 --> 01:03:45.80
And honestly, GJT was pretty good little showmanship thing.

945
01:03:45.80 --> 01:03:47.80
You know, you want to roll?

946
01:03:47.80 --> 01:03:52.80
Hey, it's kind of an issue to work with, you know?

947
01:03:52.80 --> 01:03:58.80
And I've, I've, I mean, when I talk about it, I was on the academy the other day.

948
01:03:58.80 --> 01:04:02.80
And, and I brought this up, I brought this up, this idea of showmanship.

949
01:04:02.80 --> 01:04:09.80
And when to actually say, let me show my boss how good my team is.

950
01:04:09.80 --> 01:04:12.80
Like sometimes you've got to do things like that.

951
01:04:12.80 --> 01:04:18.80
And it very counter to what I say 99% of the time, which is, hey, you work hard.

952
01:04:18.80 --> 01:04:21.80
Don't worry about the, don't worry about who sees it.

953
01:04:21.80 --> 01:04:25.80
But sometimes, all of a sudden, you're thinking, well, if we know, if the boss can't see what we're doing,

954
01:04:25.80 --> 01:04:28.80
we're not going to get these extra funds, we're not going to get this extra person.

955
01:04:28.80 --> 01:04:29.80
How do I set this up?

956
01:04:29.80 --> 01:04:32.80
So my boss can actually see, so I can take care of the team better.

957
01:04:32.80 --> 01:04:38.80
So there are times when showmanship is going to play a role in you being able to take care of your team better.

958
01:04:38.80 --> 01:04:39.80
That happens.

959
01:04:39.80 --> 01:04:46.80
How much of how much showmanship did you do flying in F-18 at the top gun school there?

960
01:04:46.80 --> 01:04:52.80
Yeah, I mean, I think that ability to, to be a little bit of a showman is,

961
01:04:52.80 --> 01:04:57.80
I mean, some port a bunch of ways, even you were just talking a minute ago, you're talking about enthusiasm.

962
01:04:57.80 --> 01:05:00.80
And you're like, hey, what's cool about that is you can fake it.

963
01:05:00.80 --> 01:05:06.80
And that even there's a little bit of showmanship of you were going to present yourself as if this situation that we're in,

964
01:05:06.80 --> 01:05:08.80
no matter what it is, it's totally awesome.

965
01:05:08.80 --> 01:05:09.80
This is going to be a blast.

966
01:05:09.80 --> 01:05:11.80
We're going to, we're going to whatever.

967
01:05:11.80 --> 01:05:18.80
And it's really not that hard to even pretend to be interested in something as opposed to walking in like,

968
01:05:18.80 --> 01:05:24.80
okay, here we go. And how instantaneously you can set the tone.

969
01:05:24.80 --> 01:05:28.80
And if you in the back of your mind recognize that part of being a showman is the people are going to follow.

970
01:05:28.80 --> 01:05:31.80
They're going to, they're going to reflect that back to you.

971
01:05:31.80 --> 01:05:38.80
They're going to guide off your behavior and whatever you show them, they're going to show them back that showmanship of how your attitude is going to be towards anything.

972
01:05:38.80 --> 01:05:45.80
And how quickly you can come into your half your team's attitude just by showing that this is going to be fun or a good time.

973
01:05:45.80 --> 01:05:49.80
And even if they know you're faking it, they get on board.

974
01:05:49.80 --> 01:06:00.80
The idea that you have to kind of play the game a little bit and sort of act a little bit as an in a leadership role and how easy it is to do that is such an overlooked thing.

975
01:06:00.80 --> 01:06:09.80
Yeah, and as you were saying that, I broke something down and I realized something about myself that is a tactic technique and procedure that's probably very important.

976
01:06:09.80 --> 01:06:13.80
And it's something that I've probably done my whole career.

977
01:06:13.80 --> 01:06:16.80
I'm not going to rely on being a good actor.

978
01:06:16.80 --> 01:06:19.80
I'm not going to be re-event rely on faking it.

979
01:06:19.80 --> 01:06:24.80
What I'm going to do is I'm going to figure out in my own head how this makes sense.

980
01:06:24.80 --> 01:06:30.80
How how this makes sense for me to be able to do what I'm going to do to the end degree.

981
01:06:30.80 --> 01:06:35.80
Like I can tell you, here's one, when I was going to college.

982
01:06:35.80 --> 01:06:37.80
I didn't want to work.

983
01:06:37.80 --> 01:06:40.80
I didn't want to do these read this book and write this paper.

984
01:06:40.80 --> 01:06:44.80
I learned into a competition. I had against the teacher.

985
01:06:44.80 --> 01:06:47.80
I was fighting against the teacher. I wanted to know more than teachers.

986
01:06:47.80 --> 01:06:50.80
I made that in my head, while I was like, oh, I'm going to crush this teacher.

987
01:06:50.80 --> 01:06:53.80
They're not going to ask me one question that I don't know the answer to.

988
01:06:53.80 --> 01:06:54.80
That's not happening.

989
01:06:54.80 --> 01:06:56.80
And so I turned into competition. My head that was fun.

990
01:06:56.80 --> 01:06:57.80
But I do the same thing.

991
01:06:57.80 --> 01:07:02.80
Like if my platoon got tasked with doing something stupid, I'd be like, oh, guess.

992
01:07:02.80 --> 01:07:05.80
I turned into a game. My head that I really did want to win.

993
01:07:05.80 --> 01:07:07.80
And I really wanted to platoon to win. So I'd be like, oh, guess what?

994
01:07:07.80 --> 01:07:10.80
We got tasked with doing this stupid hydrographic reconnaissance.

995
01:07:10.80 --> 01:07:15.80
We're going to take it so seriously that the command is going to be like, oh, my God.

996
01:07:15.80 --> 01:07:19.80
We're going to leave an impression on them from doing a hydrographic reconnaissance.

997
01:07:19.80 --> 01:07:22.80
They're going to think, we're the most square to away. Guys ever watch this.

998
01:07:22.80 --> 01:07:26.80
And all of a sudden, instead of, I would truly believe that.

999
01:07:26.80 --> 01:07:29.80
I would, I'd be like, hell yeah.

1000
01:07:29.80 --> 01:07:35.80
So I think that was my tactic and my technique was to truly find what was good about

1001
01:07:35.80 --> 01:07:39.80
some situation and completely focus on that 100%.

1002
01:07:39.80 --> 01:07:43.80
Because then I'm not trying to, because you know, I always say you can smell.

1003
01:07:43.80 --> 01:07:47.80
You can smell intent has a smell, right?

1004
01:07:47.80 --> 01:07:50.80
So if I'm like, well, this is stupid hydrographic reconnaissance,

1005
01:07:50.80 --> 01:07:52.80
but I'm going to pretend like it's good.

1006
01:07:52.80 --> 01:07:53.80
Guys, you're going to smell that.

1007
01:07:53.80 --> 01:07:56.80
But if I go, hey, they're making us do a hydrogro.

1008
01:07:56.80 --> 01:08:01.80
We're going to blow their minds when they get this chart that we give them.

1009
01:08:01.80 --> 01:08:02.80
And we're going to give it to them.

1010
01:08:02.80 --> 01:08:05.80
And we're going to give it to them. And now we'll send them, it's like, hey, well, yeah.

1011
01:08:05.80 --> 01:08:07.80
Yeah, like, they're going to want to test everyone else.

1012
01:08:07.80 --> 01:08:09.80
They're going to give all the other hydros to the other patrons.

1013
01:08:09.80 --> 01:08:11.80
Because they're going to know, we know what's up.

1014
01:08:11.80 --> 01:08:14.80
Where our goal is to make us never get tasked with the hydrographic.

1015
01:08:14.80 --> 01:08:17.80
Because they see that we know how to do it so well.

1016
01:08:17.80 --> 01:08:19.80
Boom. And all of a sudden, everyone's amped up.

1017
01:08:19.80 --> 01:08:23.80
And that's what I did probably more than anything else.

1018
01:08:23.80 --> 01:08:26.80
I remember I did that at an officer candidate school.

1019
01:08:26.80 --> 01:08:28.80
And officer candidate school.

1020
01:08:28.80 --> 01:08:30.80
You have to follow all these rules.

1021
01:08:30.80 --> 01:08:33.80
I want to vote on this speaking in a ballistic tone, which means you have to yell everything.

1022
01:08:33.80 --> 01:08:35.80
And how would just I told my whole class,

1023
01:08:35.80 --> 01:08:37.80
I'm like, when you, because you had to do it to the senior,

1024
01:08:37.80 --> 01:08:40.80
the classes above you, the senior classes.

1025
01:08:40.80 --> 01:08:43.80
You had to, you were supposed to talk in a ballistic tone to them.

1026
01:08:43.80 --> 01:08:45.80
And I said, and it was kind of annoying.

1027
01:08:45.80 --> 01:08:47.80
And I said, you should be so loud.

1028
01:08:47.80 --> 01:08:50.80
We're going to be so loud that it's going to annoy them.

1029
01:08:50.80 --> 01:08:53.80
And also just like, you can see Carrie smile.

1030
01:08:53.80 --> 01:08:54.80
And you're smiling like that.

1031
01:08:54.80 --> 01:08:56.80
That oversund became fun.

1032
01:08:56.80 --> 01:08:59.80
We were trying to be so loud when we were talking to the senior

1033
01:08:59.80 --> 01:09:01.80
classman that it was annoying.

1034
01:09:01.80 --> 01:09:02.80
It wasn't annoying to us.

1035
01:09:02.80 --> 01:09:04.80
It was annoying to them.

1036
01:09:04.80 --> 01:09:06.80
And that's exactly what we did as a matter of fact.

1037
01:09:06.80 --> 01:09:09.80
One time we were all lined up to buy they would sell us candy bars.

1038
01:09:09.80 --> 01:09:10.80
Right?

1039
01:09:10.80 --> 01:09:13.80
And so my class is lined up with the senior classes selling us coax and candy bars

1040
01:09:13.80 --> 01:09:16.80
to make money so they can make a teacher or something like this.

1041
01:09:16.80 --> 01:09:20.80
And you, and they're selling from this little closet thing.

1042
01:09:20.80 --> 01:09:23.80
And I had I said, hey, when you guys go in there,

1043
01:09:23.80 --> 01:09:25.80
you go ballistic.

1044
01:09:25.80 --> 01:09:28.80
And so sure enough, there's 50 or 60 people in my class.

1045
01:09:28.80 --> 01:09:33.80
By the 25th person, the upper classman like steps out of the hallway.

1046
01:09:33.80 --> 01:09:35.80
Attention candidates.

1047
01:09:35.80 --> 01:09:38.80
When you get in this office, you are not to sound off an ballistic token.

1048
01:09:38.80 --> 01:09:39.80
And what did I do?

1049
01:09:39.80 --> 01:09:41.80
I stepped out.

1050
01:09:41.80 --> 01:09:45.80
I was like, you know, uh, off-circuit and a willing request mission to speak.

1051
01:09:45.80 --> 01:09:46.80
Like what?

1052
01:09:46.80 --> 01:09:52.80
I'm like, you know, according to the freaking Robox7-9,

1053
01:09:52.80 --> 01:09:57.80
we are supposed to maintain ballistic tone at all times.

1054
01:09:57.80 --> 01:10:00.80
And they, they coward to it.

1055
01:10:00.80 --> 01:10:02.80
They're like, fine.

1056
01:10:02.80 --> 01:10:06.80
And so we just waited there as screaming around, I'll get my headaches.

1057
01:10:06.80 --> 01:10:09.80
So I'm going to take something like that.

1058
01:10:09.80 --> 01:10:12.80
I'm going to find a way to make this fun and good.

1059
01:10:12.80 --> 01:10:16.80
And I think that might be a more reliable tool.

1060
01:10:16.80 --> 01:10:20.80
Then my acting ability, which I can't really count on.

1061
01:10:20.80 --> 01:10:21.80
Yeah.

1062
01:10:21.80 --> 01:10:22.80
And it's not even that hard.

1063
01:10:22.80 --> 01:10:24.80
You've been set in the side that you're like, watch this.

1064
01:10:24.80 --> 01:10:25.80
That's showing show.

1065
01:10:25.80 --> 01:10:26.80
It's showing show.

1066
01:10:26.80 --> 01:10:28.80
It's like, hey, you want to give me that thing?

1067
01:10:28.80 --> 01:10:29.80
Watch this.

1068
01:10:29.80 --> 01:10:30.80
Yeah.

1069
01:10:30.80 --> 01:10:34.80
And yeah, I think, you know, obviously the semantics of the words you want to be careful with that.

1070
01:10:34.80 --> 01:10:38.80
You don't want to fake anything in terms of, hey, I don't really believe this, but

1071
01:10:38.80 --> 01:10:39.80
I'm going to do it.

1072
01:10:39.80 --> 01:10:41.80
You're going to find the truth that's inside there.

1073
01:10:41.80 --> 01:10:44.80
But if there's something, just like, hey, we're going to do this thing.

1074
01:10:44.80 --> 01:10:45.80
Watch this.

1075
01:10:45.80 --> 01:10:46.80
Yeah.

1076
01:10:46.80 --> 01:10:49.80
And that'll quickly people rally around that and get on board and it gets done.

1077
01:10:49.80 --> 01:10:50.80
It's good to go and move on.

1078
01:10:50.80 --> 01:10:51.80
Yeah.

1079
01:10:51.80 --> 01:10:52.80
And it's not that big of a deal.

1080
01:10:52.80 --> 01:10:54.80
Hell, I was going through Buds and third phase.

1081
01:10:54.80 --> 01:11:00.80
I would mean my swim buddy would voluntarily get wet and sandy.

1082
01:11:00.80 --> 01:11:03.80
And eventually they didn't know the instructions.

1083
01:11:03.80 --> 01:11:04.80
Why you didn't wet and sandy?

1084
01:11:04.80 --> 01:11:06.80
We'd like to get harder to be harder.

1085
01:11:06.80 --> 01:11:11.80
And they didn't want to see the wet and sandy on like the electric blasting range.

1086
01:11:11.80 --> 01:11:15.80
So you're doing demolition on a range and they want you to be dry and stuff.

1087
01:11:15.80 --> 01:11:21.80
And we ended up securing our class saying you guys are not allowed to get wet and sandy.

1088
01:11:21.80 --> 01:11:23.80
And then we got wet and sandy and slept outside.

1089
01:11:23.80 --> 01:11:25.80
And they were like, what are you doing?

1090
01:11:25.80 --> 01:11:27.80
And like, just trying to get harder.

1091
01:11:27.80 --> 01:11:29.80
So a little psychological game.

1092
01:11:29.80 --> 01:11:30.80
We're going to have fun with this.

1093
01:11:30.80 --> 01:11:31.80
That's what we're doing.

1094
01:11:31.80 --> 01:11:32.80
Rock and roll.

1095
01:11:32.80 --> 01:11:33.80
Showmanship.

1096
01:11:33.80 --> 01:11:35.80
Keep it in mind.

1097
01:11:35.80 --> 01:11:37.80
Number 10.

1098
01:11:37.80 --> 01:11:45.80
The ability to speak and write well to essential tools of leadership.

1099
01:11:45.80 --> 01:11:47.80
Here's the thing that I think people underestimate.

1100
01:11:47.80 --> 01:11:49.80
You can get better at both these things.

1101
01:11:49.80 --> 01:11:52.80
Writing for sure.

1102
01:11:52.80 --> 01:11:53.80
A one tip out of the gate.

1103
01:11:53.80 --> 01:11:55.80
If you're not much of a writer right now, right.

1104
01:11:55.80 --> 01:11:57.80
And then read what you wrote aloud.

1105
01:11:57.80 --> 01:11:58.80
See what it sounds like.

1106
01:11:58.80 --> 01:12:01.80
And you're going to see that you suck.

1107
01:12:01.80 --> 01:12:03.80
You suck it writing.

1108
01:12:03.80 --> 01:12:06.80
When you write something and you read it, I'll knew this sounds awful.

1109
01:12:06.80 --> 01:12:07.80
Yep.

1110
01:12:07.80 --> 01:12:09.80
That's a great first indicator.

1111
01:12:09.80 --> 01:12:10.80
And the more you practice.

1112
01:12:10.80 --> 01:12:13.80
And then find somebody to read it for you and critique it.

1113
01:12:13.80 --> 01:12:15.80
And you will get better at writing.

1114
01:12:15.80 --> 01:12:17.80
You will become more.

1115
01:12:17.80 --> 01:12:20.80
You'll become more concise.

1116
01:12:20.80 --> 01:12:23.80
You'll become a better writer over time.

1117
01:12:23.80 --> 01:12:28.80
And that will that will reflect in the way that you speak as well.

1118
01:12:28.80 --> 01:12:31.80
And also the more you speak to groups.

1119
01:12:31.80 --> 01:12:33.80
The more you speak aloud.

1120
01:12:33.80 --> 01:12:35.80
That's one of the reasons why they had you do that.

1121
01:12:35.80 --> 01:12:36.80
Oh, yes.

1122
01:12:36.80 --> 01:12:37.80
That's why you had to yell everything.

1123
01:12:37.80 --> 01:12:43.80
Because they wanted you to get confident in your voice and get confident in thinking and speaking quickly.

1124
01:12:43.80 --> 01:12:46.80
And the way the drill instructor told us.

1125
01:12:46.80 --> 01:12:51.80
He said, you know, you young officers are going to be on the bridge of a vessel of a

1126
01:12:51.80 --> 01:12:52.80
warship.

1127
01:12:52.80 --> 01:12:54.80
And it's going to be going on in the wrong direction.

1128
01:12:54.80 --> 01:12:57.80
And you need to confidently say, hey, we need to shift course right now.

1129
01:12:57.80 --> 01:12:58.80
You can't.

1130
01:12:58.80 --> 01:13:01.80
You can't be shy about it when you speak.

1131
01:13:01.80 --> 01:13:04.80
So those are things that you can definitely get better at.

1132
01:13:04.80 --> 01:13:06.80
Your ability to speak and write well.

1133
01:13:06.80 --> 01:13:08.80
And look, you're going to have some natural capability.

1134
01:13:08.80 --> 01:13:14.80
Some people are more articulate and good at speaking and public speaking.

1135
01:13:14.80 --> 01:13:16.80
Just naturally, they're just naturally good at it.

1136
01:13:16.80 --> 01:13:18.80
Just like some people have good hand eye coordination.

1137
01:13:18.80 --> 01:13:20.80
Some people have a good singing voice.

1138
01:13:20.80 --> 01:13:22.80
Some people can write well.

1139
01:13:22.80 --> 01:13:24.80
Some people can our better at writing out of the gate.

1140
01:13:24.80 --> 01:13:25.80
Then some other people.

1141
01:13:25.80 --> 01:13:27.80
It's just the way it is.

1142
01:13:27.80 --> 01:13:30.80
But you don't have to accept that that's where you need to be.

1143
01:13:30.80 --> 01:13:31.80
And that's where you're going to stay.

1144
01:13:31.80 --> 01:13:32.80
You don't have to.

1145
01:13:32.80 --> 01:13:35.80
You can truly get better at both of these things.

1146
01:13:35.80 --> 01:13:38.80
And these are essential tools of leadership.

1147
01:13:38.80 --> 01:13:39.80
Essential tools of leadership.

1148
01:13:39.80 --> 01:13:41.80
And really be a thing about it.

1149
01:13:41.80 --> 01:13:43.80
That's what leadership actually boils down to.

1150
01:13:43.80 --> 01:13:46.80
You're trying to get other humans to understand what you're saying.

1151
01:13:46.80 --> 01:13:48.80
That's that's what you're doing.

1152
01:13:48.80 --> 01:13:53.80
So if you can't articulate things well in both spoken word and written word,

1153
01:13:53.80 --> 01:13:57.80
you're going to have problems.

1154
01:13:57.80 --> 01:14:01.80
Did they train you guys actually in the Marine Corps to speak?

1155
01:14:01.80 --> 01:14:04.80
Or was it just OJT because you're briefing this and you're briefing that?

1156
01:14:04.80 --> 01:14:09.80
Yeah, my recollection for up until like top-gun level stuff.

1157
01:14:09.80 --> 01:14:12.80
They weren't giving you explicit stuff on speaking.

1158
01:14:12.80 --> 01:14:15.80
But there was a lot of work on writing.

1159
01:14:15.80 --> 01:14:17.80
And you know, in the writing there was I think they called it.

1160
01:14:17.80 --> 01:14:20.80
Was it like a standard naval letter format?

1161
01:14:20.80 --> 01:14:23.80
There was a technique of how to do that.

1162
01:14:23.80 --> 01:14:29.80
And there was a book or a publication or like a guide on how to do that.

1163
01:14:29.80 --> 01:14:33.80
And you know, that wasn't like the most or, you know, creative or unique way to do it.

1164
01:14:33.80 --> 01:14:38.80
But there was a technique to that, especially if you were trying to run some paper or go up to get in a approval of something.

1165
01:14:38.80 --> 01:14:39.80
There was a way to do it.

1166
01:14:39.80 --> 01:14:42.80
Yeah. And there's a lot of a lot of teaching on that.

1167
01:14:42.80 --> 01:14:48.80
The natural tendency thing that you you spoke to made me think of something is it was really obvious,

1168
01:14:48.80 --> 01:14:49.80
especially early in the career.

1169
01:14:49.80 --> 01:14:54.80
The people that had that speaking parts specifically, the ones that were just naturally good speakers.

1170
01:14:54.80 --> 01:14:56.80
And how draw you were to those guys.

1171
01:14:56.80 --> 01:14:58.80
You'd look at them like, damn, those are really good brief.

1172
01:14:58.80 --> 01:15:01.80
I don't even remember exactly what he's saying, but he said it really well.

1173
01:15:01.80 --> 01:15:05.80
And how powerful that capacity is.

1174
01:15:05.80 --> 01:15:11.80
And to your point that if you weren't good at it, if you're not careful, you'll convince yourself that, oh, I'm just not good at this.

1175
01:15:11.80 --> 01:15:16.80
But did you could get good at speaking by just practicing and wall playing, rehearsing and listening to yourself?

1176
01:15:16.80 --> 01:15:20.80
And how important, how important it is to sound good when you're talking.

1177
01:15:20.80 --> 01:15:24.80
And look, if you got that natural capacity, that's awesome. Congrats.

1178
01:15:24.80 --> 01:15:26.80
That's a good thing for you. It's going to help you.

1179
01:15:26.80 --> 01:15:29.80
But if you don't have that, you can improve on that like quickly.

1180
01:15:29.80 --> 01:15:31.80
If you if you spend some time on it.

1181
01:15:31.80 --> 01:15:35.80
Somebody sent me a clip the other day. It was one of my old bosses.

1182
01:15:35.80 --> 01:15:39.80
And he was getting interviewed and he was like, you know, the guy says, oh, you don't.

1183
01:15:39.80 --> 01:15:42.80
Did you have a work with Jaco and he's like, yeah, I'm on one.

1184
01:15:42.80 --> 01:15:45.80
He worked for me for whatever 18 months.

1185
01:15:45.80 --> 01:15:47.80
And he goes, oh, what do you have any good stories about Jaco?

1186
01:15:47.80 --> 01:15:50.80
Like, what was he like? And he goes, he was the thing.

1187
01:15:50.80 --> 01:15:53.80
He was the thing that I'm going to tell you and it's probably going to let you down.

1188
01:15:53.80 --> 01:15:58.80
The thing that I'll tell you about Jaco is that he was a really, really excellent writer.

1189
01:15:58.80 --> 01:16:02.80
And I was like, okay, that's cool.

1190
01:16:02.80 --> 01:16:03.80
Fair enough.

1191
01:16:03.80 --> 01:16:05.80
There's something that you can go to in the Navy.

1192
01:16:05.80 --> 01:16:07.80
It's called Master Training Specialist.

1193
01:16:07.80 --> 01:16:10.80
And it's where you learn to kind of become a instructor and they used to send

1194
01:16:10.80 --> 01:16:12.80
Buds instructors to that school.

1195
01:16:12.80 --> 01:16:15.80
And I had friends that went to it and they would have to brief, you know,

1196
01:16:15.80 --> 01:16:17.80
They'd have to teach something to a class.

1197
01:16:17.80 --> 01:16:18.80
I never went to that school.

1198
01:16:18.80 --> 01:16:21.80
I think that's the closest that you could get to some kind of a

1199
01:16:21.80 --> 01:16:26.80
formal training for speaking in the Navy.

1200
01:16:26.80 --> 01:16:30.80
Well, he's in the SEAL teams, maybe there's more I don't know.

1201
01:16:30.80 --> 01:16:37.80
And speaking of I don't know, if you're speaking, try and speak about things that you know about.

1202
01:16:37.80 --> 01:16:40.80
And if you don't know about them, you say I don't know.

1203
01:16:40.80 --> 01:16:48.80
This is one of the biggest ways to level up in your speaking ability is when someone

1204
01:16:48.80 --> 01:16:53.80
says, hey, Jaco, can you explain the flux capacitor on this engine?

1205
01:16:53.80 --> 01:16:56.80
I go, actually, I'm not familiar with flux capacitors.

1206
01:16:56.80 --> 01:16:59.80
You'll have to check with Dave Burke on that one, right?

1207
01:16:59.80 --> 01:17:04.80
And just knowing that I can say that about any subject that I don't understand

1208
01:17:04.80 --> 01:17:08.80
well enough is such a liberating feeling.

1209
01:17:08.80 --> 01:17:13.80
And oftentimes people think, well, if I'm standing up in front, I better know the answer.

1210
01:17:13.80 --> 01:17:15.80
You don't need to know the answer to anything.

1211
01:17:15.80 --> 01:17:16.80
You're human being.

1212
01:17:16.80 --> 01:17:17.80
You're not a computer.

1213
01:17:17.80 --> 01:17:22.80
And by the way, whatever needs to be found out can be Googled and figured out really quickly.

1214
01:17:22.80 --> 01:17:25.80
So you don't need to say, hey, that's an interesting question.

1215
01:17:25.80 --> 01:17:27.80
I want you Google it and get back to me with the answer.

1216
01:17:27.80 --> 01:17:28.80
Right?

1217
01:17:28.80 --> 01:17:30.80
There's no reason to think you have to know the answer.

1218
01:17:30.80 --> 01:17:31.80
Everything you don't.

1219
01:17:31.80 --> 01:17:36.80
So let that be the first thing to level you up.

1220
01:17:36.80 --> 01:17:38.80
I'm quite frankly now that I think about it.

1221
01:17:38.80 --> 01:17:46.80
I got taught this when I was getting ready to do my tried and review board to see if I was going to get my tried and the master chief was like,

1222
01:17:46.80 --> 01:17:49.80
if you don't know something, say you don't know it.

1223
01:17:49.80 --> 01:17:52.80
Don't try and bullshit us. We'll smash you.

1224
01:17:52.80 --> 01:17:53.80
You know, okay, fair enough.

1225
01:17:53.80 --> 01:17:55.80
And that's a great lesson to learn in life.

1226
01:17:55.80 --> 01:17:57.80
Everyone can see through it.

1227
01:17:57.80 --> 01:18:02.80
So speaking, writing, practice, you'll get better.

1228
01:18:02.80 --> 01:18:06.80
Speaking of speaking and writing, this is an interesting one.

1229
01:18:06.80 --> 01:18:13.80
Number 11, there is a salient difference between profanity and obscenity.

1230
01:18:13.80 --> 01:18:17.80
While the leader employees profanity tempered with discretion,

1231
01:18:17.80 --> 01:18:20.80
he never uses obscenities.

1232
01:18:20.80 --> 01:18:24.80
We're talking about some semantics and split some hairs here.

1233
01:18:24.80 --> 01:18:30.80
So from the dictionary, profanity is blasphemous or obscene language or swear word.

1234
01:18:30.80 --> 01:18:36.80
So it's the word where as obscenity is the state or quality of being obscene,

1235
01:18:36.80 --> 01:18:41.80
obscene behavior, language, images, and extremely offensive word or expression.

1236
01:18:41.80 --> 01:18:44.80
So they're definitely a bunch of crossover there.

1237
01:18:44.80 --> 01:18:47.80
That was one. That's like the dictionary definition.

1238
01:18:47.80 --> 01:18:53.80
The FCC, the federal communications, or the federal communications commission, maybe.

1239
01:18:53.80 --> 01:18:59.80
They had obscene content is not protected by the first amendment.

1240
01:18:59.80 --> 01:19:05.80
And it's by obscene content is never allowed on FCC programming.

1241
01:19:05.80 --> 01:19:07.80
It's not allowed.

1242
01:19:07.80 --> 01:19:10.80
There's a three-pronged test.

1243
01:19:10.80 --> 01:19:16.80
So number one is it appeals to the per-an average person's sexual interest.

1244
01:19:16.80 --> 01:19:20.80
So that alone can make it obscene.

1245
01:19:20.80 --> 01:19:24.80
Depector describes sexual contact in a patently offensive way.

1246
01:19:24.80 --> 01:19:30.80
And the key point here is lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

1247
01:19:30.80 --> 01:19:35.80
So that's what obscenes, according to the FCC.

1248
01:19:35.80 --> 01:19:41.80
Profane, and this is something that can make it on the FCC sometimes,

1249
01:19:41.80 --> 01:19:44.80
grossly offensive language that is considered a public nuisance.

1250
01:19:44.80 --> 01:19:52.80
So you could say a swear word as long as you weren't using the context of something offensive.

1251
01:19:52.80 --> 01:19:57.80
And the way I, I guess the way I try to simplify this for myself,

1252
01:19:57.80 --> 01:20:05.80
is that using profane words sometimes is okay, but not using them.

1253
01:20:05.80 --> 01:20:11.80
Like in the actual context that the word means.

1254
01:20:11.80 --> 01:20:13.80
I think I got it.

1255
01:20:13.80 --> 01:20:14.80
I'm not 100% sure.

1256
01:20:14.80 --> 01:20:16.80
I think we did a whole freaking podcast.

1257
01:20:16.80 --> 01:20:19.80
Like only earliest podcast we did was about swearing.

1258
01:20:19.80 --> 01:20:28.80
And yeah, so my opinion on swearing is there is, look, if you're swearing all the time,

1259
01:20:28.80 --> 01:20:33.80
hey, if you're swearing all the time and you're in the locker room, you're at the team area, you're with your buddies, whatever.

1260
01:20:33.80 --> 01:20:35.80
Not that big of a deal, of course.

1261
01:20:35.80 --> 01:20:38.80
You start standing up in front of a group of a team that you're leading.

1262
01:20:38.80 --> 01:20:40.80
And your swearing about just isn't going to work.

1263
01:20:40.80 --> 01:20:41.80
It's not going to help.

1264
01:20:41.80 --> 01:20:44.80
It's not going to, it doesn't come across well.

1265
01:20:44.80 --> 01:20:48.80
And if you develop your vocabulary, hopefully you won't need to swear.

1266
01:20:48.80 --> 01:20:54.80
And if you're swearing all the time when the time comes where you do need to swear, it's not powerful.

1267
01:20:54.80 --> 01:20:58.80
So that's what I'll stick with.

1268
01:20:58.80 --> 01:20:59.80
I don't know.

1269
01:20:59.80 --> 01:21:01.80
Dave, in the opinion on that one.

1270
01:21:01.80 --> 01:21:10.80
Yeah, I mean, I think I'm kind of contemplating what I remember people how often people swore in the military.

1271
01:21:10.80 --> 01:21:18.80
And so when I got up to Topga and like, there's no swearing up there.

1272
01:21:18.80 --> 01:21:26.80
And what they really, really wanted to impress on you was they wanted you to be professional.

1273
01:21:26.80 --> 01:21:32.80
And it's really kind of hard to make the connection between just swear words and professionalism.

1274
01:21:32.80 --> 01:21:37.80
But I think, as I'm thinking, I'm hearing you talking, actually thinking about a little bit of the logic behind that.

1275
01:21:37.80 --> 01:21:42.80
I said it was kind of really important was there was this idea.

1276
01:21:42.80 --> 01:21:47.80
And listen, I was up there like predated like social media predated phones at cameras.

1277
01:21:47.80 --> 01:21:51.80
But there was this idea that you are always being watched.

1278
01:21:51.80 --> 01:21:56.80
And what they were trying to impress upon you is that when you were a topga and patch and you're in a squadion space, whether you're an instructor or a former

1279
01:21:56.80 --> 01:21:59.80
Schuacher, that patch is going to draw attention to you.

1280
01:21:59.80 --> 01:22:01.80
I bet it's very much like a trident.

1281
01:22:01.80 --> 01:22:03.80
You see somewhere that trident.

1282
01:22:03.80 --> 01:22:08.80
And look, you're going to immediately get some cred. I don't care who you're going to get looked at.

1283
01:22:08.80 --> 01:22:13.80
And they're going to kind of be like, all right, let's, what's this guy all about?

1284
01:22:13.80 --> 01:22:18.80
And if you have a trident, I imagine in the Navy and the military service, that symbol has meaning.

1285
01:22:18.80 --> 01:22:26.80
And what they want to do impress upon us is that you are going to be judged at a higher standard, higher level than you have ever been,

1286
01:22:26.80 --> 01:22:33.80
because that patch that you had and they want to impress upon you, the need to be a professional as often as you can.

1287
01:22:33.80 --> 01:22:41.80
And I think the point you made is when, for whatever reason, I chose to use a profanity,

1288
01:22:41.80 --> 01:22:50.80
it had much more impact than my old methodology, which was pre-professional, as I just, in the squadron space,

1289
01:22:50.80 --> 01:22:57.80
I don't even know how often I swore going on. So, I think that idea that you were being judged to a particular standard.

1290
01:22:57.80 --> 01:23:03.80
And that's true, listen, what you want from your people in your organization, they want to feel the obligation to represent that organization well.

1291
01:23:03.80 --> 01:23:06.80
Your team, your company, that image, whatever it might be.

1292
01:23:06.80 --> 01:23:13.80
And you can't do that well if every other word is just some F bomb, because you don't know how to communicate in another way.

1293
01:23:13.80 --> 01:23:17.80
So, I think the way you're described it is really good, you're the nuance of that.

1294
01:23:17.80 --> 01:23:21.80
And also the idea that you are representing something that is important.

1295
01:23:21.80 --> 01:23:27.80
And if you don't have to communicate without using those words, you're not going to represent the community or that you're team very well at all.

1296
01:23:27.80 --> 01:23:28.80
Yeah.

1297
01:23:28.80 --> 01:23:34.80
I, when my kids were a little, I never swore in front of my kids, never swore in front of my wife or very seldom.

1298
01:23:34.80 --> 01:23:40.80
And then I brought my soul, I brought my son out to a trip, you know,

1299
01:23:40.80 --> 01:23:43.80
I would bring him out sometimes to training, you know, when he was little.

1300
01:23:43.80 --> 01:23:50.80
And he was at that age where, you know, maybe he, maybe he, he knew like he knew swares, right?

1301
01:23:50.80 --> 01:23:52.80
You're here in a mid school, it's like, oh my gosh.

1302
01:23:52.80 --> 01:23:54.80
So he knew swares, but he never heard me say anything.

1303
01:23:54.80 --> 01:24:01.80
The first time you heard me debrief like I pulled to, you could see his eyes like just getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

1304
01:24:01.80 --> 01:24:03.80
He was like amazed.

1305
01:24:03.80 --> 01:24:06.80
It was like totally different scenario.

1306
01:24:06.80 --> 01:24:10.80
I got asked at the last monster.

1307
01:24:10.80 --> 01:24:14.80
I forget the context of the question, but the question was basically what, what is professionalism mean to you?

1308
01:24:14.80 --> 01:24:16.80
And I was talking to Jason and Steve about it.

1309
01:24:16.80 --> 01:24:18.80
They were backstage and I got this question.

1310
01:24:18.80 --> 01:24:19.80
They were kind of looking at each other.

1311
01:24:19.80 --> 01:24:20.80
What is it?

1312
01:24:20.80 --> 01:24:22.80
And they were like, oh, it's hair, uniform is being on time.

1313
01:24:22.80 --> 01:24:23.80
And I'm like thinking about it.

1314
01:24:23.80 --> 01:24:30.80
And then I say professionalism to me is you put the mission above yourself.

1315
01:24:30.80 --> 01:24:37.80
And they were like, oh, that's a good answer because, look, why do you have a crappy uniform?

1316
01:24:37.80 --> 01:24:40.80
Because you care more about your own time.

1317
01:24:40.80 --> 01:24:41.80
Why do you show up late?

1318
01:24:41.80 --> 01:24:44.80
Oh, it's because you care more about yourself than you do about the mission.

1319
01:24:44.80 --> 01:24:46.80
Why do you, why is your hair cut out of regs?

1320
01:24:46.80 --> 01:24:51.80
Oh, it's because you don't care about the, it's like, it's a, it's a concise way of saying that.

1321
01:24:51.80 --> 01:24:54.80
And that's the same thing here.

1322
01:24:54.80 --> 01:25:01.80
Like if you're going to act professional and you're just dropping F bombs a whole time.

1323
01:25:01.80 --> 01:25:04.80
You know, who's recording you?

1324
01:25:04.80 --> 01:25:09.80
Who's listening to you? How does that sound? And is it appropriate for all audience?

1325
01:25:09.80 --> 01:25:11.80
Is it appropriate sometimes to swear?

1326
01:25:11.80 --> 01:25:17.80
Hell yes. Yes it is. And you get into a platoon and you're trying to make them understand something.

1327
01:25:17.80 --> 01:25:20.80
It's going to be cleared hot.

1328
01:25:20.80 --> 01:25:23.80
But next thing you know, that's what's interesting about the seal tames.

1329
01:25:23.80 --> 01:25:24.80
Next thing you're your briefing.

1330
01:25:24.80 --> 01:25:26.80
Whatever some civilians about something.

1331
01:25:26.80 --> 01:25:31.80
I'd you just have to be professional.

1332
01:25:31.80 --> 01:25:36.80
So there you go. Next one number 12.

1333
01:25:36.80 --> 01:25:41.80
Have consideration for others.

1334
01:25:41.80 --> 01:25:43.80
Isn't this an amazing statement?

1335
01:25:43.80 --> 01:25:45.80
It's such a big blanket statement.

1336
01:25:45.80 --> 01:25:52.80
Subordinates, superiors, friends, foes have consideration for others.

1337
01:25:52.80 --> 01:25:58.80
And if you want to really, if you want to, if I can apply some jacos stretch semantics to this,

1338
01:25:58.80 --> 01:26:02.80
consideration is also let me understand what their perspective is.

1339
01:26:02.80 --> 01:26:04.80
Let me understand how this is going to make them feel.

1340
01:26:04.80 --> 01:26:08.80
Let me understand how this is going to impact someone else.

1341
01:26:08.80 --> 01:26:13.80
And that's just that simple have consideration for others.

1342
01:26:13.80 --> 01:26:16.80
Up and down the chain of command across the chain of command.

1343
01:26:16.80 --> 01:26:20.80
Competitors, allies have consideration.

1344
01:26:20.80 --> 01:26:25.80
This is one of those things that I see right away when there's a lack of it.

1345
01:26:25.80 --> 01:26:29.80
You know, and it, I don't get bothered by it.

1346
01:26:29.80 --> 01:26:34.80
Tana stuff, but lack of consideration is one of those things that just gets to me a little bit.

1347
01:26:34.80 --> 01:26:45.80
You know, it's like, how do you know how do you know how are you not aware that there's just a total lack of consideration in the impact.

1348
01:26:45.80 --> 01:26:47.80
Do you want to answer that question, please?

1349
01:26:47.80 --> 01:26:50.80
Yeah, the answer to that question is, I'm more important than you.

1350
01:26:50.80 --> 01:26:52.80
So I'll show up late and you'll wait on me.

1351
01:26:52.80 --> 01:26:55.80
And I won't bring the right gear and I can borrow yours.

1352
01:26:55.80 --> 01:27:02.80
And I, whatever the case may be, that's all just me thinking I'm cooler and you don't really,

1353
01:27:02.80 --> 01:27:04.80
you don't really matter as much as I do.

1354
01:27:04.80 --> 01:27:09.80
I think that's where a true lack of consideration for others is the only thing I consider is myself.

1355
01:27:09.80 --> 01:27:10.80
Right.

1356
01:27:10.80 --> 01:27:13.80
Bad move is a leader.

1357
01:27:13.80 --> 01:27:17.80
Number 13 yelling detracts from your dignity.

1358
01:27:17.80 --> 01:27:20.80
Take men aside to counsel them.

1359
01:27:20.80 --> 01:27:22.80
Straight forward.

1360
01:27:22.80 --> 01:27:25.80
Again, I think,

1361
01:27:25.80 --> 01:27:28.80
Funny, you know, life said has to say like, you know,

1362
01:27:28.80 --> 01:27:30.80
Jockel looks like a yell.

1363
01:27:30.80 --> 01:27:32.80
Do I look like a yell?

1364
01:27:32.80 --> 01:27:37.80
And then he always has to say, but he never yelled at me, right?

1365
01:27:37.80 --> 01:27:47.80
And, you know, in life we'll say, I gave Jockel hundreds of opportunities or situations where I probably deserve to get yell at.

1366
01:27:47.80 --> 01:27:48.80
Y'all that.

1367
01:27:48.80 --> 01:27:52.80
Um, which is funny, but yeah, not yelling.

1368
01:27:52.80 --> 01:27:54.80
I mean, think of my way you're at.

1369
01:27:54.80 --> 01:27:59.80
Think about how effective you are as a communicator if you get to a point where you're yelling at someone.

1370
01:27:59.80 --> 01:28:04.80
Look, if I'm yelling at you to tell you to get away from the freaking edge of the building because you're about to slip.

1371
01:28:04.80 --> 01:28:09.80
What I've obviously, if I have to yell at you to get over the sound of machine gun fire, obviously, if I have to get,

1372
01:28:09.80 --> 01:28:11.80
if I have to raise my voice to everyone in the room, can hear me.

1373
01:28:11.80 --> 01:28:17.80
That's not what we're talking about, but me yelling at you and front of the team is just not just stupid.

1374
01:28:17.80 --> 01:28:26.80
And he's specific about like yelling at people in front of the group to, to berate them for a mistake that they've made.

1375
01:28:26.80 --> 01:28:30.80
No, don't do it. And I'm going to say don't do it. Just don't do it.

1376
01:28:30.80 --> 01:28:32.80
Would you write down over there today?

1377
01:28:32.80 --> 01:28:40.80
Well, you've said something in the past and, and I think there's an element to what he's saying that you can even take it to step further is,

1378
01:28:40.80 --> 01:28:47.80
listen, yelling at somebody else in front of the whole bunch of other people, I can't, I cannot think of a time when that's okay.

1379
01:28:47.80 --> 01:28:51.80
And I'm not talking about raising your voice to get a particular action because the sound is loud.

1380
01:28:51.80 --> 01:28:56.80
I'm talking like, we're in the, we get the team, jaco, screw something up and I start yelling at jaco.

1381
01:28:56.80 --> 01:29:03.80
So I can't even imagine a scenario where that's okay, but you even talked about it too.

1382
01:29:03.80 --> 01:29:06.80
Like the times that you've had to yell at someone or raise your voice.

1383
01:29:06.80 --> 01:29:11.80
I think the element that you've talked about that's so important is that you were aware of that.

1384
01:29:11.80 --> 01:29:17.80
That was based on an escalation of a whole series of other approaches that did not get the reaction,

1385
01:29:17.80 --> 01:29:21.80
which is different than, yeah, jaco, like, I just lost my temper.

1386
01:29:21.80 --> 01:29:27.80
I just no longer had control myself and I just started screaming at somebody, you know, even inside the idea of yelling,

1387
01:29:27.80 --> 01:29:32.80
which, on very rare occasions, there are some times that you're going to have to do that,

1388
01:29:32.80 --> 01:29:37.80
that you're still aware that you're doing that, as opposed to just, well, you know,

1389
01:29:37.80 --> 01:29:39.80
I just got a bad temper and that's just kind of how I am.

1390
01:29:39.80 --> 01:29:43.80
So I can't control myself and I look back and go, well, I shouldn't have done that.

1391
01:29:43.80 --> 01:29:46.80
I think it was realized I was doing a totally lost control in a leadership role.

1392
01:29:46.80 --> 01:29:50.80
And how important I think that story of even the few times in your career,

1393
01:29:50.80 --> 01:29:53.80
how to do that, you knew what you were doing.

1394
01:29:53.80 --> 01:30:00.80
Yeah, I cannot think of any situation where I yelled without thinking about like, okay,

1395
01:30:00.80 --> 01:30:02.80
I need to yell right now.

1396
01:30:02.80 --> 01:30:06.80
And yeah, let's say you get a group, let's say your whole tunzer and all of a sudden you could,

1397
01:30:06.80 --> 01:30:10.80
somebody that does something really stupid and it's an opportunity for everyone to see,

1398
01:30:10.80 --> 01:30:14.80
hey, this can't happen and obviously I haven't gotten that message across.

1399
01:30:14.80 --> 01:30:19.80
Sure, I might address someone down in front of everybody and I might yell.

1400
01:30:19.80 --> 01:30:24.80
I really can't think of any times that I did that in my 20 year career that I'll stop my head,

1401
01:30:24.80 --> 01:30:27.80
but it's not going to be on accident because you just lost control.

1402
01:30:27.80 --> 01:30:29.80
Yeah, no, that's not happening.

1403
01:30:29.80 --> 01:30:35.80
So don't be yelling, number 14, understand and use judgment.

1404
01:30:35.80 --> 01:30:38.80
No one to stop fighting for something you believe is right.

1405
01:30:38.80 --> 01:30:42.80
Okay, this is where we used my, it's start to get the rail, all of all some stuff.

1406
01:30:42.80 --> 01:30:44.80
So first of all, it's interesting that he says,

1407
01:30:44.80 --> 01:30:48.80
understand and use judgment.

1408
01:30:48.80 --> 01:30:51.80
So there's a conjunction there.

1409
01:30:51.80 --> 01:30:56.80
The first thing is just understand, which is an easy word to say,

1410
01:30:56.80 --> 01:30:58.80
but it can be very difficult to do.

1411
01:30:58.80 --> 01:31:06.80
So so trying to understand the situation and the reason that he has to say this is because so often people do things without understanding what's happening.

1412
01:31:06.80 --> 01:31:11.80
So he's telling you, understand, understand what's going on.

1413
01:31:11.80 --> 01:31:13.80
That's what you have to do.

1414
01:31:13.80 --> 01:31:15.80
And the same thing is use judgment.

1415
01:31:15.80 --> 01:31:19.80
Do you think that someone would have to tell a leader to understand and to use judgment?

1416
01:31:19.80 --> 01:31:21.80
No, why does he have to say that to here?

1417
01:31:21.80 --> 01:31:26.80
Because people all the time neither understand nor use judgment.

1418
01:31:26.80 --> 01:31:29.80
So be careful with those two.

1419
01:31:29.80 --> 01:31:34.80
Now he says, no one to stop fighting for something you believe is right.

1420
01:31:34.80 --> 01:31:50.80
And here's where I probably have the first maybe separation in understanding or separation in belief in what he's saying here.

1421
01:31:50.80 --> 01:31:52.80
Maybe it's not, but

1422
01:31:52.80 --> 01:32:05.80
I think most of the time I'm not fighting for something I believe to be right because I don't really care if I'm right or not.

1423
01:32:05.80 --> 01:32:10.80
And the reason I don't care if I'm right or not is because most things don't actually matter.

1424
01:32:10.80 --> 01:32:12.80
That's why.

1425
01:32:12.80 --> 01:32:14.80
So so Dave believes we should do it one way.

1426
01:32:14.80 --> 01:32:16.80
Dave's believe we should attack the target from the north.

1427
01:32:16.80 --> 01:32:18.80
I believe we should attack it from the west.

1428
01:32:18.80 --> 01:32:20.80
And I'm going to fight about that.

1429
01:32:20.80 --> 01:32:24.80
Most of the time it doesn't matter north or west doesn't just doesn't matter.

1430
01:32:24.80 --> 01:32:30.80
Dave wants to invest $18,000 in this software system.

1431
01:32:30.80 --> 01:32:34.80
I want to invest $12,000 in a different system.

1432
01:32:34.80 --> 01:32:36.80
And guess what?

1433
01:32:36.80 --> 01:32:38.80
It probably doesn't matter.

1434
01:32:38.80 --> 01:32:40.80
There's some advantages to the 18,000, there's some advantages to 12,000.

1435
01:32:40.80 --> 01:32:42.80
We don't really know how it's going to impact.

1436
01:32:42.80 --> 01:32:43.80
We've never done this kind of interface before.

1437
01:32:43.80 --> 01:32:47.80
And I'm going to commit my relationship value, my leadership capital.

1438
01:32:47.80 --> 01:32:50.80
Like I'm going to commit all this stuff to me just thinking I'm going to be right.

1439
01:32:50.80 --> 01:32:51.80
And I'm going to art no.

1440
01:32:51.80 --> 01:32:53.80
No, I'm not going to do that.

1441
01:32:53.80 --> 01:32:57.80
It's just a stupid thing to do.

1442
01:32:57.80 --> 01:33:05.80
So 99% of the time these things that we're fighting for actually don't matter.

1443
01:33:05.80 --> 01:33:10.80
Or you're fighting for something that's in the future that you don't know they actual outcome to.

1444
01:33:10.80 --> 01:33:13.80
So that's most of the time for me.

1445
01:33:13.80 --> 01:33:16.80
That's a very powerful lesson is you're sitting there thinking,

1446
01:33:16.80 --> 01:33:19.80
but I want to do it my way and it doesn't matter.

1447
01:33:19.80 --> 01:33:21.80
We should use this marketing company, not that marketing company.

1448
01:33:21.80 --> 01:33:24.80
We should invest in this piece of equipment or that piece of equipment.

1449
01:33:24.80 --> 01:33:26.80
I want to get this back home and not that back home.

1450
01:33:26.80 --> 01:33:27.80
Guess what?

1451
01:33:27.80 --> 01:33:31.80
It probably doesn't matter that much.

1452
01:33:31.80 --> 01:33:35.80
And by the way, if it does matter that much, and there's a real reason,

1453
01:33:35.80 --> 01:33:42.80
and I say, hey Dave, the reason I like this back home better is it has the following capabilities that the back home you want to get done have.

1454
01:33:42.80 --> 01:33:45.80
They can do this, this, this, this, this, this, this more efficient and boom.

1455
01:33:45.80 --> 01:33:47.80
Does this make sense to you?

1456
01:33:47.80 --> 01:33:51.80
If I can't articulate the reason why something is better,

1457
01:33:51.80 --> 01:33:53.80
it's probably not worth arguing over.

1458
01:33:53.80 --> 01:33:55.80
So there's your litmus test.

1459
01:33:55.80 --> 01:33:58.80
Let's put that one right that one down.

1460
01:33:58.80 --> 01:34:04.80
If you're having a hard time articulating why your plan is better than someone else's plan,

1461
01:34:04.80 --> 01:34:07.80
your plan is probably not worth arguing over.

1462
01:34:07.80 --> 01:34:11.80
Because it's too hard for you to clarify the reason it's hard for you to clarify

1463
01:34:11.80 --> 01:34:13.80
because they're both basically the same thing.

1464
01:34:13.80 --> 01:34:17.80
Or there's risk involved in both of those items.

1465
01:34:17.80 --> 01:34:22.80
So this idea to know when you stop fighting for something you believe in, right?

1466
01:34:22.80 --> 01:34:31.80
First thing, I'm going to run this thing through a filter that is so powerful that the filter is going to filter out most of the arguments I'm going to have with people.

1467
01:34:31.80 --> 01:34:33.80
Because it doesn't really matter.

1468
01:34:33.80 --> 01:34:35.80
Most things don't matter.

1469
01:34:35.80 --> 01:34:37.80
Look, are there occasional things that matter?

1470
01:34:37.80 --> 01:34:39.80
Yes, there are occasional things that matter.

1471
01:34:39.80 --> 01:34:42.80
It's so easy to articulate why they matter.

1472
01:34:42.80 --> 01:34:47.80
And it's so easy to sway people's opinions because the facts are there.

1473
01:34:47.80 --> 01:34:49.80
So it doesn't turn into an argument.

1474
01:34:49.80 --> 01:34:54.80
It turns into, hey, let me ask you some earnest questions about what you think.

1475
01:34:54.80 --> 01:34:58.80
And let me give you my perspective over here and people see it.

1476
01:34:58.80 --> 01:35:05.80
So I don't generally have to know when to stop fighting for something I believe right?

1477
01:35:05.80 --> 01:35:13.80
Because I'm generally not fighting for it. And when I do, when I do need to approach somebody about something, all I need to do is ask him from earnest questions.

1478
01:35:13.80 --> 01:35:18.80
And they, the truth is revealed to them by them answering their own questions.

1479
01:35:23.80 --> 01:35:26.80
This is, I mean, there's a lot inside this.

1480
01:35:26.80 --> 01:35:33.80
And just trying to like imagine the affront to your ego when someone says,

1481
01:35:33.80 --> 01:35:36.80
Stop fighting for what you think is right.

1482
01:35:36.80 --> 01:35:39.80
You're like, I will never stop fighting.

1483
01:35:39.80 --> 01:35:51.80
And what this is probably from is someone who's observed hundreds of people sell all their leadership capital, all their credibility over something that literally does not matter.

1484
01:35:51.80 --> 01:35:57.80
I was with the company, they were doing a workshop about picking a logo for their company.

1485
01:35:57.80 --> 01:36:00.80
And they kind of narrowed it down with three different options.

1486
01:36:00.80 --> 01:36:06.80
And they looked at the three and they were all pretty good. One was like, me and the two were like, pretty good.

1487
01:36:06.80 --> 01:36:13.80
And so sort of quickly it got to like, we're not going to do B, but A and C are good. They were both good.

1488
01:36:13.80 --> 01:36:20.80
And you know what, you could make a case for A, you could make a case for C, which tells me like they're both good.

1489
01:36:20.80 --> 01:36:23.80
They're both good. Which means it doesn't matter.

1490
01:36:23.80 --> 01:36:31.80
What we started to see was like the A group and the C group are not going to budge. And if you use this, the phrase like, hey, Jocco, I know you're supporting on A.

1491
01:36:31.80 --> 01:36:38.80
I want you to stop fighting for what you think is right. If I say it like that, like it's almost impossible for you to say, okay.

1492
01:36:38.80 --> 01:36:51.80
But the part that you're emphasizing, which is so important is the idea that it doesn't matter and how quickly you can get entrenched into something that you will sell every piece of credibility you have,

1493
01:36:51.80 --> 01:37:00.80
which means your influence in the future can go to zero because you want the round logo and I want the square logo.

1494
01:37:00.80 --> 01:37:09.80
Yep. And by the way, so you're taking all that all that leadership capital and all that future influence and you're putting it all on the you're pushing it all in.

1495
01:37:09.80 --> 01:37:14.80
You're going all in on this thing that doesn't really even freaking matter.

1496
01:37:14.80 --> 01:37:28.80
And and and a gamble because you look up in six months and like, hey, this logo, we're not getting the traction we want. But you put all in and now you look like an idiot instead of going, you know what Dave, yeah, we'll go see that looks they're pretty close. Cool sounds good man.

1497
01:37:28.80 --> 01:37:38.80
I I reserved all I kept all my money to myself. I kept all my leadership capital. I kept all my future. In fact, I made because I agreed with you because I supported your plan.

1498
01:37:38.80 --> 01:37:45.80
I got a little bit more. I took some more off the table. Actually, I grew my leadership capital in that moment.

1499
01:37:45.80 --> 01:37:51.80
And now when we look up in six months and your logo that you picked isn't really getting the traction we wanted to.

1500
01:37:51.80 --> 01:37:56.80
I get even more because I say, okay, well, you know, we tried it doesn't seem like we're getting the traction we want.

1501
01:37:56.80 --> 01:38:01.80
Do you want to try this other logo now? Boom, and all of a sudden I and now my logo goes out and wins.

1502
01:38:01.80 --> 01:38:10.80
I get even more leaders here. It's not crazy. But we'll burn our bridges and throw our leadership capital over over what's the word here?

1503
01:38:10.80 --> 01:38:16.80
Spel fighting to build something we believe is right.

1504
01:38:16.80 --> 01:38:25.80
It's this is not the way to view the world. The way to view the world is that 99% of things don't matter.

1505
01:38:25.80 --> 01:38:32.80
And then in the future and look, if you come to me with a logo that's freaking stupid.

1506
01:38:32.80 --> 01:38:37.80
You know, I'm like, hey Dave, that logo that you put together, he's like, hey, how do you like it?

1507
01:38:37.80 --> 01:38:43.80
Dave, just so you know, it's pretty much looks like a swastika, you know, but it's orange.

1508
01:38:43.80 --> 01:38:48.80
And you're like, oh, you know, like, okay, maybe we should not go with that, right?

1509
01:38:48.80 --> 01:38:52.80
Okay, you're like, oh, I didn't even see that. Okay, great. You know, boom, we're done.

1510
01:38:52.80 --> 01:38:56.80
Or, you know, you approach me, hey, Jocca, we think of this. Oh, it Dave, it's a pentagram.

1511
01:38:56.80 --> 01:39:03.80
Like, no, we're not going to use satanic ritual stuff or not. Okay, cool, you're like, got it. Go, how do I not see that?

1512
01:39:03.80 --> 01:39:08.80
Boom, so we're done. But you're like, it's a star, but you know, I want to show that we're we're flipping over the star.

1513
01:39:08.80 --> 01:39:11.80
Yeah, that's a pentagram, dude.

1514
01:39:11.80 --> 01:39:14.80
So, so you see where we're going this.

1515
01:39:14.80 --> 01:39:20.80
The chances that you come to me with a logo that's unusable is almost, almost not existing.

1516
01:39:20.80 --> 01:39:24.80
And we want to fight amount things that we quote, believe is right, and it's not worth it.

1517
01:39:24.80 --> 01:39:29.80
And you're thrown away leadership capital. And by the way, if there is something that's completely wrong,

1518
01:39:29.80 --> 01:39:35.80
and it is time to stand your ground, because someone's doing something immoral, unethical, or illegal, then cool.

1519
01:39:35.80 --> 01:39:38.80
That's where you hold the line. Of course.

1520
01:39:38.80 --> 01:39:46.80
If somebody wants to do something that is, you're a morally against somebody wants to rip off a client.

1521
01:39:46.80 --> 01:39:50.80
And you're like, hey, we're not doing that. We're not doing that.

1522
01:39:50.80 --> 01:39:55.80
It's like, okay. So we want to make it, you know, put some product out there that's dangerous.

1523
01:39:55.80 --> 01:39:58.80
And it's, we got some flaw in it, but you know what, let's just sell it anyways.

1524
01:39:58.80 --> 01:40:00.80
No, we're not doing that. That's all we're talking about.

1525
01:40:00.80 --> 01:40:06.80
And if that happens, of course, then you, you take the right action and you don't back down.

1526
01:40:06.80 --> 01:40:12.80
And even in that case, what you need more than anything in those cases is,

1527
01:40:12.80 --> 01:40:19.80
leadership capital, this credibility is a reputation of someone who only digs in on those.

1528
01:40:19.80 --> 01:40:25.80
And if you can sell it all on round versus square or red versus blue on the logo,

1529
01:40:25.80 --> 01:40:28.80
when those important times do come, nobody is going to listen to you.

1530
01:40:28.80 --> 01:40:33.80
When it actually matters, they're not going to listen to you, because they're so used to you saying,

1531
01:40:33.80 --> 01:40:38.80
I am not giving up my position. It's logo A or deaf.

1532
01:40:38.80 --> 01:40:46.80
I can't go on man. So there's some human nature that's guys, you know, obviously he's seeing of people willing to dig in on things that just don't matter.

1533
01:40:46.80 --> 01:40:48.80
And then when it does matter, nobody is listening to you.

1534
01:40:48.80 --> 01:40:51.80
At F.S. on front, you know, Jamie are our CEO.

1535
01:40:51.80 --> 01:40:57.80
She's told me like, if I push back against her, like, more than twice, she's like,

1536
01:40:57.80 --> 01:41:01.80
she says to herself, like, I'm wrong about this. I gotta go figure something out. There's something.

1537
01:41:01.80 --> 01:41:07.80
I'm wrong. She's like, if you're pushing back against me, if you ask me like three questions,

1538
01:41:07.80 --> 01:41:10.80
I'm like, oh, there's something I don't see here. I'm wrong. I don't figure this out.

1539
01:41:10.80 --> 01:41:15.80
And it's because 99% of the time, I'm like, yeah, sounds good. Yep. Go execute. Yep. Sounds good. Yeah.

1540
01:41:15.80 --> 01:41:18.80
That's better plan than I had. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. So when I say,

1541
01:41:18.80 --> 01:41:21.80
he pump the brakes. She's like, oh, there's something wrong.

1542
01:41:21.80 --> 01:41:26.80
As opposed to her thinking, oh, God, he never likes anything. Oh, here we go.

1543
01:41:26.80 --> 01:41:29.80
What do you know? How do you want to do it, John? It's like, no.

1544
01:41:29.80 --> 01:41:32.80
Don't, don't back yourself into that corner.

1545
01:41:32.80 --> 01:41:35.80
That's a healthy sense of self doubt you've talked about before.

1546
01:41:35.80 --> 01:41:41.80
I think that, you know, Jamie's a perfect example of where, you know, if you believe your right,

1547
01:41:41.80 --> 01:41:48.80
how often are you really believing that you're 100% right? If that's, if you're, if that's a pretty regular thing,

1548
01:41:48.80 --> 01:41:54.80
you might want to check that, you know? I know I'm not right a lot of the time, you know?

1549
01:41:54.80 --> 01:41:59.80
So, and if somebody else is giving you some feedback, maybe listen to that too, you know, and like Jamie,

1550
01:41:59.80 --> 01:42:05.80
if, if she starts to get some feedback, she has that humility to say, what am I not seeing here?

1551
01:42:05.80 --> 01:42:10.80
How can, you know, how can I solve this problem? Yeah, yeah, don't put yourself in that position.

1552
01:42:10.80 --> 01:42:17.80
So there you go. That's, I guess, my first disagreement a little bit with, with Glover Johns here.

1553
01:42:17.80 --> 01:42:20.80
Last couple of points here. Number 15.

1554
01:42:20.80 --> 01:42:25.80
And this is another one that, okay. So, no, or 15.

1555
01:42:25.80 --> 01:42:35.80
Discuss and argue your point of view until the decision is made, and then support the decision wholeheartedly.

1556
01:42:35.80 --> 01:42:42.80
So, again, just using the term argue and saying argue your point of view.

1557
01:42:42.80 --> 01:42:49.80
I'm not going to need to argue my point of view because I'm not married to my point of view, because the chances are, you see something, I don't see.

1558
01:42:49.80 --> 01:42:52.80
The chances are, I'm not 100% right. The chances are, my idea is flawed.

1559
01:42:52.80 --> 01:42:57.80
That's what the chances are. So, I'm not going to quote argue my point of view.

1560
01:42:57.80 --> 01:43:02.80
Until a decision is made, I don't need to. I might ask earnest questions.

1561
01:43:02.80 --> 01:43:06.80
I might try and see your perspective. I might try and understand why.

1562
01:43:06.80 --> 01:43:13.80
I might ask you why this is the best way, but I'm not quote arguing my point of view.

1563
01:43:13.80 --> 01:43:18.80
Because what is my, is my subordinates plan so freaking crazy.

1564
01:43:18.80 --> 01:43:24.80
My idea is my boss's plan so totally insane that I need to completely argue against it.

1565
01:43:24.80 --> 01:43:27.80
This is basically a run on of the last statement.

1566
01:43:27.80 --> 01:43:33.80
I don't need to argue because I'm not married to my plan, because my plan could be wrong.

1567
01:43:33.80 --> 01:43:40.80
And it probably needs adjustments. And by the way, if it's so awesome and your plan sucks so bad,

1568
01:43:40.80 --> 01:43:45.80
it's not, I don't have to argue it for very long because I go, hey Dave, your plan is to do this.

1569
01:43:45.80 --> 01:43:49.80
And if we do that, we're going to lose all this and you go, oh, cool. What did you want to do?

1570
01:43:49.80 --> 01:43:54.80
And I go, I want to do this and you go, that sounds good.

1571
01:43:54.80 --> 01:43:58.80
So, we shouldn't have to quote argue.

1572
01:43:58.80 --> 01:44:05.80
Now, when a decision gets made, I am going to do my damn just to execute on that thing.

1573
01:44:05.80 --> 01:44:10.80
But you know, I train think of all my life and the times that I got told, you know what,

1574
01:44:10.80 --> 01:44:15.80
what your points are taken, we don't care, go and execute this other thing that's the opposite.

1575
01:44:15.80 --> 01:44:20.80
I just can't think of situations where that happened.

1576
01:44:20.80 --> 01:44:25.80
I just can't think of situations where people say, hey, shut up, joc, do what I told you to do, that's it.

1577
01:44:25.80 --> 01:44:29.80
And I'm thinking, oh, this is going to have a terrible outcome.

1578
01:44:29.80 --> 01:44:33.80
There's time for, I've said, you know, this might be, this isn't going to be quite as efficient.

1579
01:44:33.80 --> 01:44:36.80
Or this might take a little bit longer.

1580
01:44:36.80 --> 01:44:40.80
Or there might be a higher risk on this maneuver over here.

1581
01:44:40.80 --> 01:44:46.80
But by doing that higher maneuver risk, we're going to save some speed and security over on this other side.

1582
01:44:46.80 --> 01:44:52.80
So, I've never just had an idiotic plan that I wasn't able to say, hey, boss, can I talk this through with you?

1583
01:44:52.80 --> 01:44:58.80
Or hey, you know, subordinate, can you talk me through this so we can understand it better?

1584
01:44:58.80 --> 01:45:03.80
Yeah.

1585
01:45:03.80 --> 01:45:05.80
I think that's pretty straightforward.

1586
01:45:05.80 --> 01:45:11.80
I think there's again some, some human nature inside there, kind of picturing again these scenarios that have played out in my life.

1587
01:45:11.80 --> 01:45:18.80
As I'm hearing you talk about the explanation of this, this leadership attribute, this behavior you want to apply.

1588
01:45:18.80 --> 01:45:24.80
Top gun, this happened a lot, this discussion, these debates on right or wrong or how we should do something.

1589
01:45:24.80 --> 01:45:27.80
And we would do this thing called staff exercises, staff exercises.

1590
01:45:27.80 --> 01:45:31.80
So, class of the over is the 25th of the sugars we'd lock the door.

1591
01:45:31.80 --> 01:45:38.80
And we would have debates over how we should do, we were very SOP heavy, we had standardization across the board.

1592
01:45:38.80 --> 01:45:41.80
There was a way to do a lot of things, not everything but a lot of things.

1593
01:45:41.80 --> 01:45:43.80
And our job was to standardize it so we could teach it.

1594
01:45:43.80 --> 01:45:48.80
And we would at the end of each class talk about what worked and what didn't, and what we needed to change.

1595
01:45:48.80 --> 01:45:49.80
And there'd be different camps.

1596
01:45:49.80 --> 01:45:53.80
There'd be one camp that said we should do it like this, another camp that should do it like that.

1597
01:45:53.80 --> 01:45:57.80
Now, what was interesting about that is that they weren't like 90-10,

1598
01:45:57.80 --> 01:46:01.80
where all this one camp is either awesome plan, this other camp has this awful stupid plan.

1599
01:46:01.80 --> 01:46:05.80
They're actually both camps like damn, those are too pretty.

1600
01:46:05.80 --> 01:46:06.80
Those are too pretty.

1601
01:46:06.80 --> 01:46:08.80
Yeah, those are pretty good ideas.

1602
01:46:08.80 --> 01:46:10.80
I see the merits of that, I see the merits of this.

1603
01:46:10.80 --> 01:46:16.80
And listen, we wanted arguing as the wrong word because that has to kind of a negative tone, but like pretty healthy to bit.

1604
01:46:16.80 --> 01:46:17.80
Do as you go back and forth.

1605
01:46:17.80 --> 01:46:25.80
And they would dig in to really make sure they was understood and it was managed by a guy who ran these meetings.

1606
01:46:25.80 --> 01:46:30.80
And he was called the standardization officer who facilitated like, all right, what do you think in there, Junk, why are we doing that?

1607
01:46:30.80 --> 01:46:37.80
And I would capture those in notes and say, okay, what he's saying is this, listen, in the end there was a winning side and a losing side.

1608
01:46:37.80 --> 01:46:38.80
And then we had to make a decision.

1609
01:46:38.80 --> 01:46:41.80
So you'd have this group of people that believed in a certain approach.

1610
01:46:41.80 --> 01:46:44.80
And in the end, we would pick a different approach.

1611
01:46:44.80 --> 01:46:48.80
What the problem would come with sometimes is someone's ego would come into play.

1612
01:46:48.80 --> 01:46:51.80
We'd then go implement this with a squaginal or a class or something.

1613
01:46:51.80 --> 01:46:58.80
And then I'd sit down and I go, hey, the way we're going to do this, this problem, Junk, we're going to do it like that and you're like, why?

1614
01:46:58.80 --> 01:47:04.80
And I'd say, well, listen, I actually didn't want to do it this way, but here's how we're going to do it.

1615
01:47:04.80 --> 01:47:10.80
So that little need for me to still be right for me to get my way and not accept the outcome.

1616
01:47:10.80 --> 01:47:19.80
I would poison the reality of, and it's the part you said there's so important is so we don't really know if we knew they wouldn't be at debate.

1617
01:47:19.80 --> 01:47:22.80
And so the only way to find out has actually got there and do it.

1618
01:47:22.80 --> 01:47:27.80
But rather than me say, hey, here's the reasons why ABC and D, let's go execute, get some good feedback.

1619
01:47:27.80 --> 01:47:29.80
I'd say, I didn't really want to do this.

1620
01:47:29.80 --> 01:47:32.80
I actually think this is kind of dumb, but we're going to go do it anyway.

1621
01:47:32.80 --> 01:47:39.80
Now what are the chances if I take that approach that when we go execute, I'm really going to get the feedback to come back and go, hey guys,

1622
01:47:39.80 --> 01:47:44.80
we executed on this plan three times and look, it did not work.

1623
01:47:44.80 --> 01:47:46.80
We need to make some changes.

1624
01:47:46.80 --> 01:47:54.80
And then go, okay, cool, let's go back to the drawing work. I'll do that all day long and we'd see it rarely, but we'd see guys go, well, I didn't get my way.

1625
01:47:54.80 --> 01:47:59.80
So I'm not really, I'm not going to support this plan. I'm going to let you know that, yeah, we're going to go do this, but I think this is dumb,

1626
01:47:59.80 --> 01:48:05.80
and there's no way that's going to work. So inside that of, hey, if you lose the debate, if you lose the argument, if you don't get your way,

1627
01:48:05.80 --> 01:48:14.80
unless you were convinced that the other side is there to destroy the company, don't just agree with it, get on board, get on board and the best,

1628
01:48:14.80 --> 01:48:21.80
it'll work and it will show come back, go, hey man, hey, Jocke, we ran this a couple times. There's some feedback, we can make some tweaks.

1629
01:48:21.80 --> 01:48:25.80
And now I can take that plan and I can influence and get it, the better outcome for the team.

1630
01:48:25.80 --> 01:48:31.80
Yeah, I think Jason Gardner at the master was like, oh, what's the best plan?

1631
01:48:31.80 --> 01:48:34.80
My plan, of course. That's right.

1632
01:48:34.80 --> 01:48:36.80
My plan's the best plan.

1633
01:48:36.80 --> 01:48:42.80
So then we go, what we're talking about right now is we're talking about a situation we got 61, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1,

1634
01:48:42.80 --> 01:48:44.80
right, we got 61, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1.

1635
01:48:44.80 --> 01:48:47.80
Okay, cool, Dave's got 6, I'm saying 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1.

1636
01:48:47.80 --> 01:48:50.80
If we're having that hard of a time, figuring out what to go with six or 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1.

1637
01:48:50.80 --> 01:48:52.80
I'm just going to say, come on, we're talking about the same plan.

1638
01:48:52.80 --> 01:48:55.80
I'll just go with the next plan, you know what, that's what's going on.

1639
01:48:55.80 --> 01:48:57.80
So, I'm going to say, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1640
01:48:57.80 --> 01:48:59.68
Guess what my default is?

1641
01:48:59.68 --> 01:49:01.32
My default is, you know what Dave sounds good.

1642
01:49:01.32 --> 01:49:02.32
Let's go with your plan.

1643
01:49:02.32 --> 01:49:03.84
So look, I'm thinking half dozen,

1644
01:49:03.84 --> 01:49:06.12
you're thinking six, let's go with your plan right now.

1645
01:49:06.12 --> 01:49:07.96
And I'm gonna execute, just like you just said,

1646
01:49:07.96 --> 01:49:11.28
I'm gonna execute it to the absolute best of my ability,

1647
01:49:11.28 --> 01:49:13.12
that way we can see if it works or not.

1648
01:49:13.12 --> 01:49:15.68
And by the way, as long as I didn't dig my heels

1649
01:49:15.68 --> 01:49:17.96
in like a jackass, if I said, you know,

1650
01:49:17.96 --> 01:49:18.84
you said you're a sign,

1651
01:49:18.84 --> 01:49:20.24
I said, well, what about this Dave and you said,

1652
01:49:20.24 --> 01:49:21.44
yeah, I know, but most of the time,

1653
01:49:21.44 --> 01:49:23.40
and I go, well, okay, you know what?

1654
01:49:23.40 --> 01:49:25.84
It seems like yours covers the same thing

1655
01:49:25.84 --> 01:49:27.52
for the most part, it's a little bit of a different direction,

1656
01:49:27.52 --> 01:49:29.52
but let's give it a shot, I'm down.

1657
01:49:29.52 --> 01:49:31.04
And my leadership capital just went up

1658
01:49:31.04 --> 01:49:32.36
and I don't look like an idiot.

1659
01:49:32.36 --> 01:49:33.24
And the person that looks like an idiot

1660
01:49:33.24 --> 01:49:38.24
is like, no, my points are more important than your points.

1661
01:49:38.32 --> 01:49:42.92
So my default mode, when we're in a 50,

1662
01:49:42.92 --> 01:49:44.68
actually my default mode is like, hey,

1663
01:49:44.68 --> 01:49:45.96
we're gonna go with Dave's plan,

1664
01:49:45.96 --> 01:49:48.60
but certainly in a 50, 50 situation,

1665
01:49:48.60 --> 01:49:50.88
it's like, it doesn't matter.

1666
01:49:50.88 --> 01:49:52.24
See, it still doesn't matter,

1667
01:49:52.24 --> 01:49:53.80
because as you first started talking through that,

1668
01:49:53.80 --> 01:49:55.32
I was like, oh, so this is something that matters

1669
01:49:55.32 --> 01:49:56.84
because you got this people saying this,

1670
01:49:56.84 --> 01:50:00.04
but no, you can't satisfy both things a little lump.

1671
01:50:00.04 --> 01:50:02.68
Well, I guess maybe you could find a compromise

1672
01:50:02.68 --> 01:50:07.36
that you could create, but in lieu of some kind of a compromise,

1673
01:50:07.36 --> 01:50:09.92
you know, you either do this procedure or that procedure.

1674
01:50:09.92 --> 01:50:12.64
Right, well, when this happens, when you get this tail lock

1675
01:50:12.64 --> 01:50:15.16
on your plane, you could do this or this,

1676
01:50:15.16 --> 01:50:16.20
and there's some advantage to this,

1677
01:50:16.20 --> 01:50:19.68
and there's some advantage is that, okay,

1678
01:50:19.68 --> 01:50:22.32
they both have advantages, guess what,

1679
01:50:22.32 --> 01:50:23.60
which one do you wanna do a Dave?

1680
01:50:23.60 --> 01:50:24.44
You wanna do this one?

1681
01:50:24.44 --> 01:50:26.40
Cool, we'll do that one for now.

1682
01:50:26.40 --> 01:50:28.52
Boom, it's so easy.

1683
01:50:28.52 --> 01:50:31.32
So again, I don't have to argue my point of view

1684
01:50:31.32 --> 01:50:32.84
because I'm not gonna back myself into a corner

1685
01:50:32.84 --> 01:50:35.12
because I'm not gonna give away my position,

1686
01:50:35.12 --> 01:50:36.44
because I'm not gonna be married to something

1687
01:50:36.44 --> 01:50:39.16
that I don't know about, that we can't determine

1688
01:50:39.16 --> 01:50:41.000
the impact of the future on.

1689
01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.52
People wanna bet so much on the future

1690
01:50:43.52 --> 01:50:45.12
when we don't know what's gonna happen in the future.

1691
01:50:45.12 --> 01:50:45.96
Yeah, it's crazy.

1692
01:50:45.96 --> 01:50:47.68
And think about what I do to the relationship.

1693
01:50:47.68 --> 01:50:50.88
If I do what you just said, and I go, hey, you know what?

1694
01:50:50.88 --> 01:50:53.52
I honestly, dude, I came in coming with the plan

1695
01:50:53.52 --> 01:50:55.96
I go on, you know, six, and I hear you wanna go

1696
01:50:55.96 --> 01:50:57.76
and go off doesn't, hey, let's go execute.

1697
01:50:57.76 --> 01:50:59.24
And if I project in my mind,

1698
01:50:59.24 --> 01:51:01.12
the next conversation we're gonna have,

1699
01:51:02.28 --> 01:51:03.12
I'm gonna win on both,

1700
01:51:03.12 --> 01:51:05.68
because I'm gonna come back and go, hey, dude.

1701
01:51:05.68 --> 01:51:07.60
I did your plan, dude, it was awesome man.

1702
01:51:07.60 --> 01:51:08.76
We crushed it.

1703
01:51:08.76 --> 01:51:09.88
That was awesome man.

1704
01:51:09.88 --> 01:51:11.000
Thank you for that feedback.

1705
01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.72
The team did really well.

1706
01:51:12.72 --> 01:51:14.16
And it's awesome.

1707
01:51:14.16 --> 01:51:17.88
Or I can back go, dude, I ran with the half dozen plan man

1708
01:51:17.88 --> 01:51:20.12
and we kinda got rolled a couple times here.

1709
01:51:20.12 --> 01:51:21.40
What are you seeing, like,

1710
01:51:21.40 --> 01:51:23.20
gone, let's see, in the same thing.

1711
01:51:23.20 --> 01:51:24.68
But either way, we're good.

1712
01:51:24.68 --> 01:51:25.84
Yeah.

1713
01:51:25.84 --> 01:51:27.80
But if I don't take that approach,

1714
01:51:27.80 --> 01:51:30.04
that next conversation about the future

1715
01:51:30.04 --> 01:51:33.08
that we do not know is almost always

1716
01:51:33.08 --> 01:51:34.24
gonna have some sort of friction

1717
01:51:34.24 --> 01:51:35.20
that's gonna be some argument.

1718
01:51:35.20 --> 01:51:36.88
So I can even just project in my mind

1719
01:51:36.88 --> 01:51:39.08
by going with your plan.

1720
01:51:39.08 --> 01:51:41.20
I'm gonna win no matter what,

1721
01:51:41.20 --> 01:51:42.36
because I'm gonna come back and go, dude,

1722
01:51:42.36 --> 01:51:43.96
you're awesome, great idea.

1723
01:51:43.96 --> 01:51:44.96
Thanks, bro.

1724
01:51:44.96 --> 01:51:46.04
Or I'm gonna come back and go,

1725
01:51:46.04 --> 01:51:47.04
dude, I'm still struggling.

1726
01:51:47.04 --> 01:51:47.88
Can you walk me through this?

1727
01:51:47.88 --> 01:51:49.92
We are not getting past these steps.

1728
01:51:49.92 --> 01:51:51.28
And you're gonna need to go,

1729
01:51:51.28 --> 01:51:52.52
hey, dude, we're having the exact same problem.

1730
01:51:52.52 --> 01:51:53.92
So we might need to go back to the drawing board

1731
01:51:53.92 --> 01:51:55.40
or, oh, hey, that's a great question.

1732
01:51:55.40 --> 01:51:56.80
We did this this and this.

1733
01:51:56.80 --> 01:51:58.04
Either way, we're winning,

1734
01:51:58.04 --> 01:51:59.52
because the team is winning

1735
01:51:59.52 --> 01:52:01.40
and our relationship is stronger for it.

1736
01:52:01.40 --> 01:52:03.40
Can you see guys all the time, just dig in?

1737
01:52:04.52 --> 01:52:08.36
I very often see losing as a winning.

1738
01:52:08.36 --> 01:52:10.68
And this is a classic situation.

1739
01:52:10.68 --> 01:52:12.20
Oh, Dave, I was wrong.

1740
01:52:12.20 --> 01:52:13.12
You were right.

1741
01:52:13.12 --> 01:52:14.40
You're awesome.

1742
01:52:14.40 --> 01:52:16.20
To me, I wrote about that leadership strategy

1743
01:52:16.20 --> 01:52:17.56
in tactics, I'm like, hey,

1744
01:52:17.56 --> 01:52:19.64
it gives me the opportunity to prove how humble I am.

1745
01:52:19.64 --> 01:52:20.84
Because by the way, I'm running around

1746
01:52:20.84 --> 01:52:22.28
and trying to make calls, trying to make decisions.

1747
01:52:22.28 --> 01:52:24.40
And I'm the one that's having to put word out.

1748
01:52:24.40 --> 01:52:25.72
And when all of a sudden Dave does something better,

1749
01:52:25.72 --> 01:52:28.20
I go, hey, Dave, dude, awesome work, man.

1750
01:52:28.20 --> 01:52:30.24
You were definitely right about it being a half dozen

1751
01:52:30.24 --> 01:52:31.96
and a not six, sweet.

1752
01:52:33.16 --> 01:52:35.24
That's an opportunity for me.

1753
01:52:35.24 --> 01:52:37.52
And yet people see it as losing

1754
01:52:37.52 --> 01:52:39.08
and they won't take it.

1755
01:52:40.36 --> 01:52:41.92
So be careful of this one.

1756
01:52:43.92 --> 01:52:46.92
Last one, pretty straightforward, stay ahead of your boss.

1757
01:52:49.20 --> 01:52:50.68
Kind of brilliant, right?

1758
01:52:50.68 --> 01:52:51.84
Stay ahead of your boss.

1759
01:52:51.84 --> 01:52:54.84
And stay ahead of the power curve.

1760
01:52:54.84 --> 01:52:56.52
To me, stay ahead of your boss.

1761
01:52:56.52 --> 01:52:59.28
Another way of thinking about this is when it comes

1762
01:52:59.28 --> 01:53:02.92
to functioning as a human, thanks to strategic

1763
01:53:02.92 --> 01:53:03.92
and think long term.

1764
01:53:03.92 --> 01:53:05.48
That's how you stay ahead of your boss.

1765
01:53:05.48 --> 01:53:06.84
You stay ahead of your boss by your boss.

1766
01:53:06.84 --> 01:53:08.28
That's a fire right now, put it out.

1767
01:53:08.28 --> 01:53:09.44
And you go cool, got it boss.

1768
01:53:09.44 --> 01:53:11.60
And then you look to see where that next fire is gonna be.

1769
01:53:11.60 --> 01:53:13.52
It's as simple as that.

1770
01:53:13.52 --> 01:53:14.56
It's as simple as that.

1771
01:53:14.56 --> 01:53:15.80
Stay ahead of your boss.

1772
01:53:17.68 --> 01:53:20.20
Make your boss look good again.

1773
01:53:20.20 --> 01:53:21.28
Leadership strategy in tactics.

1774
01:53:21.28 --> 01:53:23.68
I'm gonna make it, make your boss look good.

1775
01:53:23.68 --> 01:53:26.44
Put it, what incredible way to build a good relationship

1776
01:53:26.44 --> 01:53:27.28
with your boss?

1777
01:53:27.28 --> 01:53:29.98
What incredible way to build leadership capital

1778
01:53:29.98 --> 01:53:30.82
with your boss?

1779
01:53:30.82 --> 01:53:32.12
Make your boss look good.

1780
01:53:32.12 --> 01:53:33.32
That's my goal.

1781
01:53:33.32 --> 01:53:35.08
Do I want to credit, no, I want Dave Burke,

1782
01:53:35.08 --> 01:53:36.44
my boss to get the credit, that's what I want.

1783
01:53:36.44 --> 01:53:37.60
Want him to look awesome.

1784
01:53:37.60 --> 01:53:40.36
You think Dave Burke's not gonna take care of me?

1785
01:53:40.36 --> 01:53:41.28
All day.

1786
01:53:42.28 --> 01:53:44.96
So once Dave Burke is taking care of me,

1787
01:53:44.96 --> 01:53:46.12
guess what I can do?

1788
01:53:46.12 --> 01:53:47.36
I can take care of my team.

1789
01:53:47.36 --> 01:53:48.48
And that's my mission.

1790
01:53:48.48 --> 01:53:49.96
Well, now I can take care of my team.

1791
01:53:49.96 --> 01:53:51.48
Now we can take care of the mission.

1792
01:53:51.48 --> 01:53:52.80
And life is good.

1793
01:53:52.80 --> 01:53:53.64
That's what we're doing.

1794
01:53:56.36 --> 01:53:58.88
And this is another thing that seems hard.

1795
01:53:58.88 --> 01:54:01.24
That's not, it's just not hard.

1796
01:54:01.24 --> 01:54:03.20
And if we spend less time lamenting

1797
01:54:03.20 --> 01:54:04.32
everything wrong with our boss,

1798
01:54:04.32 --> 01:54:07.000
you're talking about the OCD boss a couple minutes ago

1799
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.44
about any word for no CD boss.

1800
01:54:08.44 --> 01:54:10.52
Yeah, I remember that and I immediately,

1801
01:54:10.52 --> 01:54:14.52
this guy came to mind and people hated working for him.

1802
01:54:14.52 --> 01:54:16.60
They hated working for him.

1803
01:54:16.60 --> 01:54:19.04
And look, I work from, it was not easy.

1804
01:54:19.04 --> 01:54:20.16
First, I had to figure him out,

1805
01:54:20.16 --> 01:54:21.64
but once I figured him out,

1806
01:54:21.64 --> 01:54:23.32
it was super easy to work for him

1807
01:54:23.32 --> 01:54:25.08
because I knew what he wanted.

1808
01:54:25.08 --> 01:54:26.12
And I could stay ahead of him.

1809
01:54:26.12 --> 01:54:29.80
And I could anticipate the things that he needed.

1810
01:54:29.80 --> 01:54:31.60
And if you just spent less time thinking about

1811
01:54:31.60 --> 01:54:33.08
what's wrong with your boss

1812
01:54:33.08 --> 01:54:34.68
and all the dumb things he's making you do.

1813
01:54:34.68 --> 01:54:35.68
And then more time thing like,

1814
01:54:35.68 --> 01:54:37.32
all right, what is he trying to get accomplished?

1815
01:54:37.32 --> 01:54:38.60
What's his personality like,

1816
01:54:38.60 --> 01:54:41.08
what do I need to do to get ahead of him

1817
01:54:41.08 --> 01:54:43.28
to help him so I can help the team

1818
01:54:43.28 --> 01:54:46.52
cracking that code is usually not that hard.

1819
01:54:46.52 --> 01:54:48.16
And when you crack the code,

1820
01:54:48.16 --> 01:54:49.64
not only does your boss life get better,

1821
01:54:49.64 --> 01:54:51.84
your life gets so much better,

1822
01:54:51.84 --> 01:54:53.76
it's so much easier.

1823
01:54:53.76 --> 01:54:56.64
And just like you described to push that down to the team,

1824
01:54:56.64 --> 01:54:58.08
that's where the win is.

1825
01:54:58.08 --> 01:54:59.56
It's like you can take care of your team,

1826
01:54:59.56 --> 01:55:00.56
you can help your team,

1827
01:55:00.56 --> 01:55:02.44
you can make sure your team's successful.

1828
01:55:02.44 --> 01:55:04.40
So if you're looking at this about how hard that is,

1829
01:55:04.40 --> 01:55:05.88
that's just your ego telling you.

1830
01:55:05.88 --> 01:55:08.000
When your boss is the problem,

1831
01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:09.52
this is something I want with your boss.

1832
01:55:09.52 --> 01:55:11.84
Just figure out what he wants and get ahead of him.

1833
01:55:11.84 --> 01:55:13.44
And it's really, really not that hard.

1834
01:55:14.52 --> 01:55:16.40
All right, well, there you go.

1835
01:55:16.40 --> 01:55:20.64
Those are some simple rules for being a better leader

1836
01:55:20.64 --> 01:55:22.88
and a better follower and a better human.

1837
01:55:22.88 --> 01:55:24.44
And here's the thing I gotta pay attention to.

1838
01:55:24.44 --> 01:55:28.64
You can only see these things if you detach.

1839
01:55:28.64 --> 01:55:31.72
And by the way, when you detach

1840
01:55:31.72 --> 01:55:33.60
and you take a step back,

1841
01:55:33.60 --> 01:55:36.16
the thing that you really have to detach

1842
01:55:36.16 --> 01:55:38.12
from is still part of you, it's your ego.

1843
01:55:38.12 --> 01:55:41.36
It's driving so many of these mistakes that we make.

1844
01:55:41.36 --> 01:55:43.72
So you can't just detach from the situation,

1845
01:55:43.72 --> 01:55:45.16
you can't just detach from your boss,

1846
01:55:45.16 --> 01:55:46.84
you can't just detach from the plan,

1847
01:55:46.84 --> 01:55:50.08
you gotta detach and be able to see your own ego,

1848
01:55:50.08 --> 01:55:54.72
which is probably the root of 97% of these problems.

1849
01:55:54.72 --> 01:55:56.56
So take a step back,

1850
01:55:57.52 --> 01:55:59.72
write these things down, write these rules down.

1851
01:55:59.72 --> 01:56:03.60
Just go, go, take about face, write these rules down.

1852
01:56:03.60 --> 01:56:05.68
Go, read them before you go into a meeting.

1853
01:56:06.64 --> 01:56:08.52
Read them before you make a decision.

1854
01:56:08.52 --> 01:56:11.08
Read them before you meet with your support man.

1855
01:56:11.08 --> 01:56:11.96
Read through.

1856
01:56:11.96 --> 01:56:15.76
At the end, check yourself, how do you do want them?

1857
01:56:15.76 --> 01:56:18.80
And eventually, over time,

1858
01:56:18.80 --> 01:56:19.92
this is how you become better

1859
01:56:19.92 --> 01:56:22.88
because you won't rely on having to read

1860
01:56:22.88 --> 01:56:25.64
through these things, you'll start to know them

1861
01:56:25.64 --> 01:56:28.000
and they will become second nature.

1862
01:56:30.08 --> 01:56:31.76
So, there you go.

1863
01:56:31.76 --> 01:56:32.92
All right, with that,

1864
01:56:34.16 --> 01:56:36.28
we carry, why are you here?

1865
01:56:36.28 --> 01:56:38.88
Just so everyone knows you've treated people

1866
01:56:38.88 --> 01:56:40.84
that are freaking out right now.

1867
01:56:40.84 --> 01:56:44.12
Echo Charles, he needed a break, bro.

1868
01:56:44.12 --> 01:56:47.52
He was, I mean, he had the stress level was high.

1869
01:56:47.52 --> 01:56:51.20
He hadn't been cruising in at least a few days.

1870
01:56:51.20 --> 01:56:53.84
And so, Echo Charles, don't worry, everybody.

1871
01:56:53.84 --> 01:56:55.16
E.C. will be back.

1872
01:56:56.28 --> 01:56:57.60
He's okay.

1873
01:56:57.60 --> 01:56:59.56
He just had to reset, you know,

1874
01:56:59.56 --> 01:57:01.32
had to recharge the batteries.

1875
01:57:01.32 --> 01:57:02.96
Recharge the mono.

1876
01:57:02.96 --> 01:57:03.96
Yeah.

1877
01:57:03.96 --> 01:57:04.96
Back on the island.

1878
01:57:04.96 --> 01:57:05.80
Back on the island.

1879
01:57:05.80 --> 01:57:06.64
Yeah.

1880
01:57:06.64 --> 01:57:08.000
So he had to go get some island time in.

1881
01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.60
That's where Echo has been.

1882
01:57:09.60 --> 01:57:10.72
He'll be back hopefully.

1883
01:57:10.72 --> 01:57:11.76
I don't know, you never know.

1884
01:57:11.76 --> 01:57:13.28
Maybe this year, you know,

1885
01:57:13.28 --> 01:57:14.40
let me make the call, whatever.

1886
01:57:14.40 --> 01:57:15.24
It's no factor.

1887
01:57:15.24 --> 01:57:16.24
Keep cover, whatever.

1888
01:57:16.24 --> 01:57:17.24
Whatever Echo needs.

1889
01:57:17.24 --> 01:57:18.56
We're just here.

1890
01:57:18.56 --> 01:57:21.52
So, don't worry, this is still the Echo podcast.

1891
01:57:21.52 --> 01:57:22.36
He'll be back.

1892
01:57:24.52 --> 01:57:26.60
It's kind of a lose lose for you, isn't it, Kerry?

1893
01:57:26.60 --> 01:57:27.92
Be in here.

1894
01:57:27.92 --> 01:57:28.96
I mean, it's hard.

1895
01:57:28.96 --> 01:57:31.40
Look, you know, Echo,

1896
01:57:32.32 --> 01:57:33.76
he's kind of got that thing going

1897
01:57:33.76 --> 01:57:35.68
where people just, he's just nice

1898
01:57:35.68 --> 01:57:38.84
and kind of like if you do something,

1899
01:57:38.84 --> 01:57:40.12
anything different than him.

1900
01:57:40.12 --> 01:57:41.24
Even if you do the same thing as him,

1901
01:57:41.24 --> 01:57:43.52
people like, well, look at you trying to be like,

1902
01:57:43.52 --> 01:57:45.20
if you're trying to jack Echo style.

1903
01:57:45.20 --> 01:57:47.48
You're gonna lose lose situation, bro.

1904
01:57:47.48 --> 01:57:49.08
Hey, I'm just happy to be here, man.

1905
01:57:49.08 --> 01:57:50.76
You know, please happy to be here.

1906
01:57:50.76 --> 01:57:51.84
He's sitting in the hot seat.

1907
01:57:51.84 --> 01:57:53.64
Anything pressing record over there?

1908
01:57:53.64 --> 01:57:54.64
Yeah.

1909
01:57:54.64 --> 01:57:55.84
No, it's awesome, man.

1910
01:57:55.84 --> 01:57:57.40
We get the cover down and yeah,

1911
01:57:57.40 --> 01:57:59.76
when he comes back, I'll be back in the shadows.

1912
01:57:59.76 --> 01:58:00.76
Back in the shadows.

1913
01:58:00.76 --> 01:58:02.24
Retreat to the shadows.

1914
01:58:02.24 --> 01:58:03.72
Or maybe he'll get whacked.

1915
01:58:03.72 --> 01:58:04.72
All right.

1916
01:58:04.72 --> 01:58:06.76
He'll just be like, well, looks like I'm in here now.

1917
01:58:06.76 --> 01:58:07.76
Yeah.

1918
01:58:07.76 --> 01:58:09.92
He won't give up the chair.

1919
01:58:09.92 --> 01:58:11.60
Yeah, he didn't give up the chair.

1920
01:58:11.60 --> 01:58:12.76
Here he gets bummed out.

1921
01:58:12.76 --> 01:58:16.08
We were doing Jordan Peterson.

1922
01:58:16.08 --> 01:58:19.12
And he was, it got scheduled and he was gonna be in Hawaii

1923
01:58:19.12 --> 01:58:19.96
and he wasn't around.

1924
01:58:19.96 --> 01:58:21.40
He was bummed about that.

1925
01:58:21.40 --> 01:58:22.24
Yeah.

1926
01:58:22.24 --> 01:58:24.56
We were talking about that, you know,

1927
01:58:24.56 --> 01:58:26.72
the Tim Kennedy podcast, you know?

1928
01:58:26.72 --> 01:58:29.000
Yeah, he was kind of bummed about that one too.

1929
01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:29.60
Be bummed about that.

1930
01:58:29.60 --> 01:58:30.60
Yeah.

1931
01:58:30.60 --> 01:58:32.96
That was a good one, man.

1932
01:58:32.96 --> 01:58:35.52
That was that one went by quick.

1933
01:58:35.52 --> 01:58:36.52
For how long it was?

1934
01:58:36.52 --> 01:58:38.32
Long it was.

1935
01:58:38.32 --> 01:58:40.84
Almost five hours and 50 minutes.

1936
01:58:40.84 --> 01:58:42.32
And it I was like, oh, that's a long,

1937
01:58:42.32 --> 01:58:44.36
but also, Huberman was,

1938
01:58:44.36 --> 01:58:47.16
Huberman was five hours and 20 minutes.

1939
01:58:47.16 --> 01:58:49.72
And of course, Sean Parnell was five hours and 25 minutes

1940
01:58:49.72 --> 01:58:50.56
or something like this.

1941
01:58:50.56 --> 01:58:52.20
That's a long time to be talking.

1942
01:58:52.20 --> 01:58:55.72
If we were better at milking,

1943
01:58:55.72 --> 01:58:58.44
we would just break it up in the four different podcasts.

1944
01:58:58.44 --> 01:59:01.32
Now, don't worry, people, we got you.

1945
01:59:01.32 --> 01:59:02.16
We got you.

1946
01:59:02.16 --> 01:59:03.000
We're here.

1947
01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:03.84
We're gonna put it out.

1948
01:59:03.84 --> 01:59:04.84
One hit.

1949
01:59:04.84 --> 01:59:07.96
A little bit of that immediate gratification for you.

1950
01:59:07.96 --> 01:59:08.80
Dude, let me know.

1951
01:59:08.80 --> 01:59:10.44
There's some people that look at that thing.

1952
01:59:10.44 --> 01:59:14.04
They see five hours and 50 minutes and they go, oh, damn.

1953
01:59:14.04 --> 01:59:15.40
Let me get that two ex-son.

1954
01:59:15.40 --> 01:59:16.40
Yeah.

1955
01:59:16.40 --> 01:59:17.40
Yeah.

1956
01:59:17.40 --> 01:59:18.24
We've got that up.

1957
01:59:18.24 --> 01:59:20.08
And there's also some people that are like hell, yeah.

1958
01:59:20.08 --> 01:59:21.08
Yeah, for sure.

1959
01:59:21.08 --> 01:59:24.40
I'm definitely in that camp any time I see a five hour

1960
01:59:24.40 --> 01:59:25.48
Jocca podcast.

1961
01:59:25.48 --> 01:59:28.52
You just know it's like, well, the thing is,

1962
01:59:28.52 --> 01:59:30.92
there's no time limit in either direction.

1963
01:59:30.92 --> 01:59:31.76
Yeah.

1964
01:59:31.76 --> 01:59:32.96
There's no goal.

1965
01:59:32.96 --> 01:59:33.32
Right.

1966
01:59:33.32 --> 01:59:34.32
Did we could go an hour?

1967
01:59:34.32 --> 01:59:35.56
We could go five hours.

1968
01:59:35.56 --> 01:59:36.40
I don't know.

1969
01:59:36.40 --> 01:59:37.24
We'd go to all hours.

1970
01:59:37.24 --> 01:59:38.72
We'd go 30 minutes.

1971
01:59:38.72 --> 01:59:40.84
If it's there, we'll roll with it.

1972
01:59:40.84 --> 01:59:41.84
We're getting it.

1973
01:59:41.84 --> 01:59:42.84
Yeah.

1974
01:59:42.84 --> 01:59:43.68
That would get.

1975
01:59:43.68 --> 01:59:45.20
See Tim and I had a lot of, you know,

1976
01:59:45.20 --> 01:59:47.56
with the fight background and he was doing all that stuff

1977
01:59:47.56 --> 01:59:50.40
when I was like, we were in the game, right?

1978
01:59:50.40 --> 01:59:53.60
At the same time, I was like, old, I think I'm.

1979
01:59:54.88 --> 01:59:57.68
Maybe eight years older than him or something like this.

1980
01:59:57.68 --> 02:00:01.96
And so, but, you know, chocolate,

1981
02:00:01.96 --> 02:00:03.64
like I just saw chocolate out the UFC.

1982
02:00:03.64 --> 02:00:04.68
So what's up?

1983
02:00:04.68 --> 02:00:05.88
What was that UFC?

1984
02:00:05.88 --> 02:00:06.68
It was cool.

1985
02:00:06.68 --> 02:00:07.72
That was good, man.

1986
02:00:07.72 --> 02:00:09.68
It was awesome.

1987
02:00:09.68 --> 02:00:13.96
But we were, so we had a lot to talk about there, you know.

1988
02:00:13.96 --> 02:00:17.20
But Echo Charles would be back with his powerful question,

1989
02:00:17.20 --> 02:00:18.20
in opinion.

1990
02:00:18.20 --> 02:00:21.24
Standing by his shoulder.

1991
02:00:21.24 --> 02:00:22.28
Speaking of being strategic,

1992
02:00:22.28 --> 02:00:23.60
make sure you're saying shape, make sure you're

1993
02:00:23.60 --> 02:00:24.52
just to keep your health.

1994
02:00:24.52 --> 02:00:25.72
That's strategic move.

1995
02:00:25.72 --> 02:00:26.88
Keep stay healthy.

1996
02:00:26.88 --> 02:00:27.88
You know how you do that, Jocca,

1997
02:00:27.88 --> 02:00:29.60
feel, Jocca, feel.com.

1998
02:00:29.60 --> 02:00:30.92
How's the new flavor's date?

1999
02:00:30.92 --> 02:00:35.92
So just FYI, we have an energy drink.

2000
02:00:37.40 --> 02:00:39.72
It's called go.

2001
02:00:39.72 --> 02:00:41.44
And it will give you energy.

2002
02:00:42.52 --> 02:00:44.48
When we initially made it,

2003
02:00:44.48 --> 02:00:48.84
the taste profile was based on my taste buds,

2004
02:00:48.84 --> 02:00:50.88
which are not normal.

2005
02:00:50.88 --> 02:00:54.000
My taste buds are hypersensitive to the sweetness.

2006
02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.48
And so I tried these things, I was like, oh, yeah,

2007
02:00:55.48 --> 02:00:56.32
that's very sweet.

2008
02:00:56.32 --> 02:00:57.36
That's, you know, this is good to go.

2009
02:00:57.36 --> 02:00:59.64
This basically tastes like a Coca-Cola to me, right?

2010
02:00:59.64 --> 02:01:03.000
Now it's like just, wow, it's wrong.

2011
02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:04.96
And a lot of people that normally eat a lot of sugar,

2012
02:01:04.96 --> 02:01:07.000
they were like, what is this, this doesn't taste good.

2013
02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.76
So we read it all the flavors, all of them.

2014
02:01:10.76 --> 02:01:13.36
Dave, you got your new afterburn orange.

2015
02:01:13.36 --> 02:01:14.72
How was that going down today?

2016
02:01:14.72 --> 02:01:16.04
It's good.

2017
02:01:16.04 --> 02:01:19.04
I'm gonna similar but I never drank an energy drink

2018
02:01:19.04 --> 02:01:21.16
before go ever, I don't drink them.

2019
02:01:21.16 --> 02:01:23.72
So I had no frame of reference.

2020
02:01:23.72 --> 02:01:24.76
When we made the orange,

2021
02:01:24.76 --> 02:01:26.96
I got to do all the flavor testing and all that stuff

2022
02:01:26.96 --> 02:01:29.32
at the end, I'm like, this thing is incredible.

2023
02:01:29.32 --> 02:01:31.36
It tastes like an orange crush or whatever.

2024
02:01:33.76 --> 02:01:36.16
The I've had almost, oh, not all,

2025
02:01:36.16 --> 02:01:38.16
I've had almost all the new flavors

2026
02:01:38.16 --> 02:01:41.88
and they are ridiculously good tasting.

2027
02:01:41.88 --> 02:01:43.60
So I'm over here thinking like, all right,

2028
02:01:43.60 --> 02:01:46.20
I'm doing timing, I'm doing the reasons I gotta anticipate

2029
02:01:46.20 --> 02:01:50.04
all these, now I just want the way it tastes.

2030
02:01:50.04 --> 02:01:51.20
Yeah.

2031
02:01:51.20 --> 02:01:52.36
Yeah.

2032
02:01:52.36 --> 02:01:53.72
I'm drinking the citrus psycho,

2033
02:01:53.72 --> 02:01:56.16
which was by far a worse seller.

2034
02:01:56.16 --> 02:01:57.40
And the reasons are worse sellers

2035
02:01:57.40 --> 02:01:59.32
because the first one that came out

2036
02:01:59.32 --> 02:02:03.76
before I had any semblance of trying to make things taste

2037
02:02:03.76 --> 02:02:06.28
good for the world at large.

2038
02:02:06.28 --> 02:02:09.92
And now this one is freaking delicious.

2039
02:02:09.92 --> 02:02:12.84
So Dave Babens, hate or hate here, citrus psycho.

2040
02:02:12.84 --> 02:02:15.60
It tastes like, there's a reason that this was

2041
02:02:15.60 --> 02:02:17.44
the first flavor that we made, by the way.

2042
02:02:17.44 --> 02:02:19.04
The reason this is the first flavor that we made

2043
02:02:19.04 --> 02:02:23.76
was because I thought to myself, what's the common flavor

2044
02:02:23.76 --> 02:02:25.88
that everybody likes?

2045
02:02:25.88 --> 02:02:28.68
He, you know, well, it's lemon lime.

2046
02:02:28.68 --> 02:02:33.28
Look at Gatorade, look at Sprite, all those flavors.

2047
02:02:33.28 --> 02:02:34.44
That's okay, lemon lime.

2048
02:02:34.44 --> 02:02:37.40
This is a standard flavor.

2049
02:02:37.40 --> 02:02:39.32
It's like chocolate vanilla, right?

2050
02:02:39.32 --> 02:02:40.52
It's the same thing as I said, oh, you're gonna make

2051
02:02:40.52 --> 02:02:44.56
a protein-shaped cool chocolate or vanilla or strawberry.

2052
02:02:44.56 --> 02:02:46.60
That's what this was to me.

2053
02:02:46.60 --> 02:02:49.32
So this was the first flavor, that's why.

2054
02:02:49.32 --> 02:02:52.68
But man, I didn't sweeten it enough.

2055
02:02:52.68 --> 02:02:56.92
And now this thing is, and it's still sugar-free,

2056
02:02:56.92 --> 02:02:59.60
it's still keto, it's still all natural,

2057
02:02:59.60 --> 02:03:02.20
it's still pasteurized, it's still freaking,

2058
02:03:02.20 --> 02:03:05.20
this all of the same qualities of awesomeness,

2059
02:03:05.20 --> 02:03:06.68
but it tastes delicious.

2060
02:03:06.68 --> 02:03:10.80
So there you go, jockelfuel.com, check all that stuff out.

2061
02:03:10.80 --> 02:03:11.92
Check out some milk.

2062
02:03:11.92 --> 02:03:13.48
Jeff some milk over the fourth of your life.

2063
02:03:13.48 --> 02:03:14.68
Yeah, of course.

2064
02:03:14.68 --> 02:03:17.96
I was talking about that on that last podcast.

2065
02:03:17.96 --> 02:03:20.56
I'm up to two milkshakes a day.

2066
02:03:20.56 --> 02:03:23.000
Yeah, because once you start tracking the macros,

2067
02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:24.60
you need that extra hit or a protein.

2068
02:03:24.60 --> 02:03:25.44
You got to eat two.

2069
02:03:25.44 --> 02:03:27.84
Yeah, if it can be measured, it can be managed.

2070
02:03:27.84 --> 02:03:30.000
Or two scoops in a moker, do you go one?

2071
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.56
No, I go one.

2072
02:03:31.56 --> 02:03:32.36
I double it up.

2073
02:03:32.36 --> 02:03:33.36
You double it up.

2074
02:03:33.36 --> 02:03:36.000
Wait, I love that hitter.

2075
02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.48
Jockelfuel.com, go to wallwafewant.

2076
02:03:38.48 --> 02:03:40.88
If you want the drinks, go to vitamin shop,

2077
02:03:40.88 --> 02:03:44.32
go to HEB down in Tayhouse, we got you.

2078
02:03:44.32 --> 02:03:45.40
And try the new flavors.

2079
02:03:45.40 --> 02:03:48.08
The new flavors are kind of hitting the stores right now.

2080
02:03:48.08 --> 02:03:51.56
So what's it, July by August, I think we'll be

2081
02:03:51.56 --> 02:03:54.56
in all new flavors, but go get them.

2082
02:03:54.56 --> 02:03:58.60
Orgenusa.com, get some cool American made apparel.

2083
02:03:58.60 --> 02:04:00.32
I'll up at the UFC a lot of people were pumped.

2084
02:04:00.32 --> 02:04:03.64
A lot of people were pumped on the hunt line coming out

2085
02:04:03.64 --> 02:04:06.56
on the, you know, I had guys every key I have

2086
02:04:06.56 --> 02:04:08.28
as an origin key, I'm like hell, yeah.

2087
02:04:08.28 --> 02:04:10.56
Merk it, Merk it.

2088
02:04:10.56 --> 02:04:13.000
So if you want to get on the American made,

2089
02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:16.60
train, then go to Orgenusa.com, get yourself,

2090
02:04:16.60 --> 02:04:20.88
do you just repeat jeans, people representing jeans,

2091
02:04:20.88 --> 02:04:22.40
that's freaking legit.

2092
02:04:22.40 --> 02:04:25.84
You know, it's a sad day when your iconic American jeans

2093
02:04:25.84 --> 02:04:27.40
are not made in America.

2094
02:04:27.40 --> 02:04:28.68
But guess what they are now,

2095
02:04:28.68 --> 02:04:31.88
because now the only pair of iconic jeans you can get

2096
02:04:31.88 --> 02:04:34.88
is good old origin usay.com.

2097
02:04:34.88 --> 02:04:37.44
Get some of that, Jockels store.

2098
02:04:37.44 --> 02:04:40.92
That's where we have stuff that might help you on the path.

2099
02:04:40.92 --> 02:04:41.72
Might help you on the path.

2100
02:04:41.72 --> 02:04:45.40
Uh, Echo has been busy too on some new discipline

2101
02:04:45.40 --> 02:04:46.80
and cool freedom shirts.

2102
02:04:46.80 --> 02:04:48.20
Really, some new ones.

2103
02:04:48.20 --> 02:04:50.04
Yeah, go check those out.

2104
02:04:50.04 --> 02:04:51.80
Some new colors on there.

2105
02:04:51.80 --> 02:04:53.60
And there's like a little bit of a Gigi-to-line

2106
02:04:53.60 --> 02:04:54.56
that's forming as well.

2107
02:04:54.56 --> 02:04:58.36
So Gigi-to is life, T-shirt is quite popular.

2108
02:04:58.36 --> 02:04:59.20
It is.

2109
02:04:59.20 --> 02:05:00.04
It is.

2110
02:05:00.04 --> 02:05:02.64
It's super clean and then we've got the Dean List on there as well.

2111
02:05:02.64 --> 02:05:03.88
The Dean List.

2112
02:05:03.88 --> 02:05:05.68
Do we have the foot soldier one yet?

2113
02:05:05.68 --> 02:05:06.96
I'm gonna make a foot.

2114
02:05:06.96 --> 02:05:08.96
He's got that little sticker that says foot soldier.

2115
02:05:08.96 --> 02:05:12.40
And it's like a Dean Lister and like a nom style helmet.

2116
02:05:12.40 --> 02:05:14.000
And it just says foot soldier.

2117
02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:14.84
We gotta get that.

2118
02:05:14.84 --> 02:05:16.28
We got the foot.

2119
02:05:16.28 --> 02:05:17.68
The foot that Dean Listed Dean Listed.

2120
02:05:17.68 --> 02:05:18.68
The Dean Lister.

2121
02:05:18.68 --> 02:05:19.68
Yeah.

2122
02:05:19.68 --> 02:05:21.96
But also shirt locker.

2123
02:05:21.96 --> 02:05:24.04
New shirt every month with that.

2124
02:05:24.04 --> 02:05:28.28
And we've been just going pretty hard on this.

2125
02:05:28.28 --> 02:05:32.36
The last month was pretty awesome if you get it.

2126
02:05:32.36 --> 02:05:33.80
What was last month's shirt?

2127
02:05:33.80 --> 02:05:35.96
Or it might have been month before last thing.

2128
02:05:35.96 --> 02:05:38.04
We did kind of a Gijo style.

2129
02:05:38.04 --> 02:05:39.68
Oh yeah, that was the discipline one.

2130
02:05:39.68 --> 02:05:40.88
But it was Gijoish.

2131
02:05:40.88 --> 02:05:41.88
Right.

2132
02:05:41.88 --> 02:05:44.68
And then the Charlie Mike was, I believe after that.

2133
02:05:44.68 --> 02:05:45.84
So there you go.

2134
02:05:45.84 --> 02:05:47.24
JoccoStore.com.

2135
02:05:47.24 --> 02:05:48.08
You can check some of that out.

2136
02:05:48.08 --> 02:05:48.92
Subscribe to the podcast.

Jocco Underground.

2139
02:05:51.12 --> 02:05:52.12
Jocco Underground.com.

2140
02:05:52.12 --> 02:05:56.36
If you want to hear, if you're nervous about the platform, look, we don't own the platform

2141
02:05:56.36 --> 02:05:59.48
that you're listening to unless you're listening to us right now on Jocco Underground.com.

2142
02:05:59.48 --> 02:06:00.48
Then we own it.

2143
02:06:00.48 --> 02:06:02.20
No one can stop us.

2144
02:06:02.20 --> 02:06:03.20
We got that.

2145
02:06:03.20 --> 02:06:06.000
But if you're listening on some of the other platforms that are out there, look, we don't

2146
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:07.000
know them.

2147
02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:08.000
And they could shut us down.

2148
02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.000
They could sense to us.

2149
02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.88
Maybe they don't want us talking about war.

2150
02:06:10.88 --> 02:06:13.80
Maybe they don't want us talking about whatever we're talking about.

2151
02:06:13.80 --> 02:06:15.12
And we got to be aware of that.

2152
02:06:15.12 --> 02:06:16.12
We got to have a contingency plan.

2153
02:06:16.12 --> 02:06:21.48
So Jocco Underground.com is a contingency there.

2154
02:06:21.48 --> 02:06:22.64
And I read a bunch of books.

2155
02:06:22.64 --> 02:06:28.60
If you want to check out the books that I've written, go to Amazon and buy them all.

2156
02:06:28.60 --> 02:06:30.20
We have Essal on front.

2157
02:06:30.20 --> 02:06:31.64
David and I work at Essal on front.

2158
02:06:31.64 --> 02:06:33.64
We solve problems through leadership.

2159
02:06:33.64 --> 02:06:36.000
We take these principles of combat leadership.

2160
02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
We teach people how to apply them inside their business.

2161
02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.68
Get your business aligned around leadership.

2162
02:06:40.68 --> 02:06:44.36
If you have leaders, if you have problems, their leadership problems.

2163
02:06:44.36 --> 02:06:50.38
So Essal on front.com come to the mustard next mustard zone at Atlanta, hot Atlanta, October

2164
02:06:50.38 --> 02:06:51.88
12th, through the 14th.

2165
02:06:51.88 --> 02:06:52.88
We're going to sell it out.

2166
02:06:52.88 --> 02:06:53.88
We sell it everything.

2167
02:06:53.88 --> 02:06:55.56
So come and check that out.

2168
02:06:55.56 --> 02:06:59.16
We have the extreme ownership academy.

2169
02:06:59.16 --> 02:07:02.44
Online extreme ownership.com.

2170
02:07:02.44 --> 02:07:03.44
We got courses.

2171
02:07:03.44 --> 02:07:04.96
We're about to record a course today.

2172
02:07:04.96 --> 02:07:08.12
We're doing a course on relationships and the value of relationships.

2173
02:07:08.12 --> 02:07:09.68
How to build relationships.

2174
02:07:09.68 --> 02:07:12.72
How to maintain relationships.

2175
02:07:12.72 --> 02:07:15.72
Why relationships are so powerful.

2176
02:07:15.72 --> 02:07:23.56
So these are the kind of conversations that we have on that platform that you can study,

2177
02:07:23.56 --> 02:07:25.52
you can test, you can learn.

2178
02:07:25.52 --> 02:07:28.16
And leadership is not an inoculation.

2179
02:07:28.16 --> 02:07:30.68
You can't read extreme ownership one time.

2180
02:07:30.68 --> 02:07:32.68
You've got it.

2181
02:07:32.68 --> 02:07:34.60
It doesn't work.

2182
02:07:34.60 --> 02:07:37.32
For a while, I'd say, well, you want some more or that stuff.

2183
02:07:37.32 --> 02:07:42.76
Listen to the podcast, but then there now there's 300 and 41 podcasts.

2184
02:07:42.76 --> 02:07:45.48
There's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours.

2185
02:07:45.48 --> 02:07:47.04
I can't say, well, let's go listen to the podcast.

2186
02:07:47.04 --> 02:07:51.32
Now we had to, we had to streamline it and distill it down.

2187
02:07:51.32 --> 02:07:55.88
The principles so that people could learn them and actively train in them.

2188
02:07:55.88 --> 02:07:57.04
Just like you go to the gym.

2189
02:07:57.04 --> 02:07:58.48
Just like you trained your jitsu.

2190
02:07:58.48 --> 02:08:00.64
Just like you pick up your get box and play guitar at night.

2191
02:08:00.64 --> 02:08:04.000
If you're not practicing, you're not learning.

2192
02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:07.12
So go to extrememonorship.com, check out the courses.

2193
02:08:07.12 --> 02:08:09.16
Also, I'm on their live a bunch.

2194

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.64
So extrememonorship.com, come and check that out.

2196

Momily, she's got an awesome charity organization.

She helps with health issues.

2200
02:08:27.52 --> 02:08:33.36
Putting, putting service members through health protocols that aren't paid for by the

2201
02:08:33.36 --> 02:08:36.48
military, but that are extremely helpful.

2202
02:08:36.48 --> 02:08:40.56
So America's mighty warriors.org.

2203
02:08:40.56 --> 02:08:41.56

Micah, he's up there in the mountains right now.

2207
02:08:47.56 --> 02:08:52.20
I'm just getting it teaching people what's up.

2208
02:08:52.20 --> 02:08:57.20
And of course on Twitter, on the Graham, on Facebook, Dave's at David R. Burke.

2209
02:08:57.20 --> 02:09:03.68
Here he's at Carrie Underscore, Helton, he didn't get that, he didn't get the real one.

2210
02:09:03.68 --> 02:09:04.68
Not fast.

2211
02:09:04.68 --> 02:09:05.68
Had to throw that underscore in there.

2212
02:09:05.68 --> 02:09:06.68
Too slow.

2213
02:09:06.68 --> 02:09:11.52
Yep, just a forever sign of being a little too slow.

2214
02:09:11.52 --> 02:09:13.92
Everybody knows.

2215
02:09:13.92 --> 02:09:16.32
And if you want to see me on there, I'm at Jocca.

2216
02:09:16.32 --> 02:09:17.44
Well, I don't want to underscore in there.

2217
02:09:17.44 --> 02:09:18.44
No, no, nothing.

2218
02:09:18.44 --> 02:09:19.44
Nothing.

2219
02:09:19.44 --> 02:09:20.84
Just got into deep early.

2220
02:09:20.84 --> 02:09:23.32
Coming at you.

2221
02:09:23.32 --> 02:09:26.88
While you're in there, just watch out because the algorithm might grab you by the leg.

2222
02:09:26.88 --> 02:09:29.36
And start dragging you down.

2223
02:09:29.36 --> 02:09:31.44
So be careful of that.

2224
02:09:31.44 --> 02:09:38.56
And thanks to all our military personnel out there, the current and future Glover Johns.

2225
02:09:38.56 --> 02:09:42.48
Thanks for doing what you are doing out there every day to lead and protect our country.

2226
02:09:42.48 --> 02:09:46.96
And the same goes to our police and law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

2227
02:09:46.96 --> 02:09:52.08
correction officers, border patrol, secret service, all you first responders.

2228
02:09:52.08 --> 02:09:56.84
Thank you for what you do every day to protect us here at home.

2229
02:09:56.84 --> 02:10:04.20
And everyone else just trying to remember and implement these simple lessons from Glover

2230
02:10:04.20 --> 02:10:07.36
Johns, things like do the small things well.

2231
02:10:07.36 --> 02:10:11.36
Things like be a doer and a self-starter.

2232
02:10:11.36 --> 02:10:12.96
Never be satisfied.

2233
02:10:12.96 --> 02:10:17.68
Have consideration of others.

2234
02:10:17.68 --> 02:10:21.000
Remember that the heart of the training, the more the troops are going to brag.

2235
02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:25.52
These are all things that are simple, but not easy.

2236
02:10:25.52 --> 02:10:32.08
But if you do get them and you do implement them, you'll be a better leader and you'll

2237
02:10:32.08 --> 02:10:34.60
be a better human being.

2238
02:10:34.60 --> 02:10:38.08
So go out there and get after it.

2239
02:10:38.08 --> 02:10:42.56
And until next time, this is Dave and Carrie and Jocco.

2240
02:10:42.56 --> 02:11:09.000
Hail.
