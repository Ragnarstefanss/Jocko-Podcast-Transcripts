Yes everyone's been asked before I'm sorry it's been taking a while we got the grounded podcast where we talk about you jitsu somebody just asked for a podcast about Women's jiu jitsu for jockel podcast and we already had it we had it on the grounded podcast So check out grounded podcast if you want to hear about jiu jitsu and life Warrior kid podcasts Just get your kids on the path Set them up to have an awesome life Get them on the warrior kid podcast if you Also want to support a warrior kid You can go to irishokes ranch.com and you can get aiden who is making soap Which allows you your family your friends everyone you know if you get this soap you can all Stay clean Yeah, speaking of which If I'm not mistaken and it looked deep into it, but I saw I saw hints of a new warrior kid soap It's no rules, I'm going to, I'm going to have a shift and I'm going to cut your throat while, you know, ding, ding, round starts, you know, I come out with a K-bar and stick it into your spine. But you got to be ready for it because if you're driving your car and you're an explosion or machine gun fire Especially if you've been in the game, you know like for real you might get a little bit of like a little bit of a adrenaline flow no big deal Yeah, you took it in their interesting direction, you know as far as the point, but you know I dig it in your probably right, but you're less in order to know where they're saying that you get this Irgonomically correct sword and that's gonna be well difference. Yeah, I mean, to add to that to, you know, you get a guy MMA again, a guy who's like his, you know, he's a great wrestler, great grappler, good submission guy, whatever. That's the code we got leadership strategy and tactics field manual We got way the warrior kid one two and three we got Mikey in the dragons We got discipline he goes freedom of field manual we got extreme ownership of the dichotomy leadership check out all those books if you want to Good information and I'll tell you what's cool So this is just like, I mean, can you imagine what this, the whole scenario is like this guy's, he's saying I'm going to surrender and then he flies off the handle because no, I'm going to attack him. so What we did was they put special effects in there and the the company The the publisher was kind of acting they were cool, but they were kind of acting like this was Like it was crazy like it was a little bit of a crazy idea So anyways they did it Now that's something that I, that definitely was interesting to me because, you know, you think of these imperialists, you think of the British empire going in, well, we got a bunch of, whatever, we got a bunch of black guys down here in Africa, let's make them fight. I'm going to strike, you know, rather than strategically go for, you know, make yourself in a better position as far as like tactically strategically whatever. What do you, you know, what's, what's our, what are we going to do when something goes wrong, you know, it's a boor is going to make a plan. I got a read a funny review I'm gonna go on there pull up a good review For while it's copy and pacing some of them because they were really good That that's something that we like to refer to as layers One else we got don't forget about some other podcasts We got a podcast we had a podcast Who's called the thread will be re releasing it soon I? But, you know, ever since I went down there and even before that, I mean, it's just a war, you know, if you know the root word of the word, command, you always think about what this was all about. And so, they were more, there was no kind of deal set up for them to be compensated to say, look, if you want us to change the way we're running this economy, we need to, you know, we need money, you know, we need money to hire people. So versus someone who you don't know I'm not saying that not I'm saying you don't know and if they're on the path you kind of know them Yeah, I don't think I own it's kind of cowardly or whatever, you know, it's like, yeah, they start or the guy who gets taken down right here There's the call the prayer there's some explosions and when we when we decided to do that Well first of the main reason as late for night we've got like words written in there like Pup, pup, pup, pup, like machine gun fire Doesn't this paint the most stereotypical picture of these officer guys that are like, hey, I'm smart, I'm a great athlete, you know, you know, why don't you just study this stuff on brave. And it's a, it's a saying, it's kind of wrapped up in a saying that the, that the South African boors had and the, the, the saying is, and I'm not going to do this right because you know, it's a foreign language, but the, the saying is on boor mackon plan. I'm going to, it's like, yeah, you keep, you give me with that sneak attack stuff, right, almost like they're not fighting or something. And I'm sure at some point, there's I've got a, I've got quite a few good books of, you know, the normal jockel podcast first person account of a guy that was on the battlefield, which looks some of these battles were just insane, especially because you get to see the, well, will will will will just, will just jump into it. I'm going to send you know, and I'm going to send 1700 people to take a thousand of 1700 foot tall tall hill. oh cool, you know, I grab that I grabbed you know You took a page notes you can take a page and notes on that book if you read it 50 times and roll You'll take a page notes every time on any of these books that I'm talking about even the kids books And I'm trying to remember the exact situation, but he basically says the story where he got in a fight with a guy and then the guy, you know, they got in the fight or the I'm like can we do this Jamie says we can do this Nice, all right rock and roll look and if we get to that point in September and we still have to do some kind of Social distancing scenario Whatever we got to do we got to do it Everyone you're fighting, I mean, if we try to, if we try to figure out what this looked like, I bet you this looks like a 300 pound boxer that's going up against a 100 pound boxer. And this person's going to be small and we can, we're going to do the boxing thing and they're going to throw, they're punches don't even hurt us. This is just, it seems so obvious right now, but instead of setting up in the perfect position, maybe on the crest of a hill where you have total high ground dominance, they put a little distraction up there and they'd set up in a different position, maybe lower on the hill or in the military crest, you know, maybe two thirds of a third of the way down the hill or whatever. And then I want, you know, I want to have about after party like the old UFC guys, I'm sure they're still good, but I haven't been in that part of your mouth. And by the way look it might not be me it might be some other trooper out there That's gonna that's gonna that's gonna detach that's gonna look around That's gonna make the right decision at the right time And the way, and they kind of acted in the way we think commando's act, which means they, you know, they would use mobility and speed and violence of action, surprise and set of ambushes and those kind of behaviors. And they're still firing, you know, they're still setting up in lines and firing valleys together as a group and on command, you know, ready to fire that type of thing.
