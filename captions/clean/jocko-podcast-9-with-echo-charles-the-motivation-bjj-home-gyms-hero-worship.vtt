00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.28
This is Jocco podcast number nine with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:11.28 --> 00:00:17.92
Perhaps I stabbed our Savior in his sacred helpless side, yet have called his name and

3
00:00:17.92 --> 00:00:22.68
blessing when and after times I died.

4
00:00:22.68 --> 00:00:28.40
Through the chival of the ages, midst of pomp and toil of war, have I fought and strove

5
00:00:28.40 --> 00:00:33.04
and perished countless times upon this star.

6
00:00:33.04 --> 00:00:39.20
I have sinned and I have suffered, played the hero and the nave, fought for belly, shame,

7
00:00:39.20 --> 00:00:44.40
or country, and for each have found a grave.

8
00:00:44.40 --> 00:00:50.76
So as through a glass and darkly, the age long strife I see, where I fought in many

9
00:00:50.76 --> 00:00:56.56
guys' many names, but always me.

10
00:00:56.56 --> 00:01:03.96
So forever in the future, shall I battle as of your dying to be born a fighter, but to die

11
00:01:03.96 --> 00:01:10.08
again once more?

12
00:01:10.08 --> 00:01:18.32
And that is a poem by General George S. Patton.

13
00:01:18.32 --> 00:01:25.44
And I've been thinking about the podcast and about the direction and about the things

14
00:01:25.44 --> 00:01:28.68
and about what we talk about and what I talk about.

15
00:01:28.68 --> 00:01:39.44
And I was actually looking for a for a non-military book for a book that talks about

16
00:01:39.44 --> 00:01:45.76
the same kind of things that I think about, but it's not about war, because there's a very

17
00:01:45.76 --> 00:01:49.64
small population that are engaged in war and real war.

18
00:01:49.64 --> 00:01:52.92
So I've been looking for a book and I've got a bunch of books that I enjoy and books that

19
00:01:52.92 --> 00:02:01.88
I like and I've been looking for a good book that is not a war book.

20
00:02:01.88 --> 00:02:11.44
And I had some close ones and maybe they'll make the cut, but we're not there yet.

21
00:02:11.44 --> 00:02:18.64
Because quite simply war is at another level.

22
00:02:18.64 --> 00:02:22.68
That's not better and it's not a good thing.

23
00:02:22.68 --> 00:02:27.84
And I don't worship war, but it is.

24
00:02:27.84 --> 00:02:34.000
In fact, the ultimate human struggle.

25
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:44.60
It has Judge Holden in the book Blood Meridian puts it.

26
00:02:44.60 --> 00:02:55.48
This is the nature of war, whose stake is at once the game and the authority and the justification.

27
00:02:55.48 --> 00:03:01.60
Seen so war is the trueest form of divination.

28
00:03:01.60 --> 00:03:06.96
It is the testing of one's will and the will of another within that larger will which

29
00:03:06.96 --> 00:03:12.40
because it binds them is therefore forced to select.

30
00:03:12.40 --> 00:03:21.04
War is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence.

31
00:03:21.04 --> 00:03:25.72
War is God.

32
00:03:25.72 --> 00:03:29.56
Now I'm going to tell you, I'm not going to go into Blood Meridian tonight.

33
00:03:29.56 --> 00:03:37.24
Blood Meridian, I've talked about it on a couple of occasions and one day we will.

34
00:03:37.24 --> 00:03:41.52
And it's probably going to take multiple shows and it's going to take research, but that

35
00:03:41.52 --> 00:03:53.60
is a heavy, heavy book that is thick with content and meaning and words that are powerful.

36
00:03:53.60 --> 00:03:58.56
And that's a tiny slice of blood Meridian.

37
00:03:58.56 --> 00:04:03.72
And we will get to it at some point and I actually get people who is like, hey, do

38
00:04:03.72 --> 00:04:08.24
Blood Meridian do Blood Meridian because there are a lot of people that take a lot of information

39
00:04:08.24 --> 00:04:11.24
a lot of meaning from that book.

40
00:04:11.24 --> 00:04:13.96
But I'm not ready yet.

41
00:04:13.96 --> 00:04:14.96
I'm not.

42
00:04:14.96 --> 00:04:19.16
That's going to take and it's the same thing with Shakespeare people like, hey, when you're

43
00:04:19.16 --> 00:04:22.80
going to do the barred and it's the same thing.

44
00:04:22.80 --> 00:04:27.48
I want to be fully prepared and I'm either going to do it.

45
00:04:27.48 --> 00:04:33.28
Maybe I won't be fully prepared to do the whole thing, but maybe we'll take chunks of

46
00:04:33.28 --> 00:04:37.96
Blood Meridian, of course, chunks of Shakespeare and start to try and digest them because

47
00:04:37.96 --> 00:04:40.44
there's a big meal.

48
00:04:40.44 --> 00:04:45.84
Now, that's why, you know, that's why we're not talking about a business book tonight.

49
00:04:45.84 --> 00:04:48.000
That's why we're not talking about a business leader.

50
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.04
That's why we're not talking about a sports leader.

51
00:04:50.04 --> 00:04:57.60
That's when I, we're not talking about a public figure that had to struggle through whatever

52
00:04:57.60 --> 00:05:04.84
to get to the top of the mountain that they were climbing or a mountain climber.

53
00:05:04.84 --> 00:05:07.12
We're not talking about that.

54
00:05:07.12 --> 00:05:09.68
We're talking about a war.

55
00:05:09.68 --> 00:05:17.44
And like I said, war does not God like Judge Holden describes it in Blood Meridian, but

56
00:05:17.44 --> 00:05:21.68
it certainly is a powerful force and it certainly is the ultimate struggle.

57
00:05:21.68 --> 00:05:27.40
The ultimate struggle from life against other humans that want to end your life and that's

58
00:05:27.40 --> 00:05:33.20
it, which brings us to Patton.

59
00:05:33.20 --> 00:05:42.92
And that poem, you know, obviously in Patton's mind, he was a warrior before, over and over

60
00:05:42.92 --> 00:05:43.92
again.

61
00:05:43.92 --> 00:05:44.92
Yeah, he thought he was reincarnated.

62
00:05:44.92 --> 00:05:45.92
Sorry, he's reincarnated.

63
00:05:45.92 --> 00:05:48.28
Like, he's a soldier for Caesar.

64
00:05:48.28 --> 00:05:52.000
So old, you know, for hundreds and thousands of years.

65
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Yeah.

66
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:04.72
And before I do jump in a paton, I do detankers, detankers of the world, the US military.

67
00:06:04.72 --> 00:06:10.92
We worked with one one AD, the first brigade, first armored division in Ramadiya,

68
00:06:10.92 --> 00:06:23.32
Iraq in 2006, the ready first and the text, the 68 ton Abrams main battle tank with a giant

69
00:06:23.32 --> 00:06:37.20
turbine engine grinding the street apart, as they come to support and rescue and save

70
00:06:37.20 --> 00:06:42.12
the seals, which they did over and over again.

71
00:06:42.12 --> 00:06:49.28
And there was no better sound in the world than those tanks firing up their engines and

72
00:06:49.28 --> 00:06:59.08
putting main gun rounds into buildings to kill bad guys and protect American troops.

73
00:06:59.08 --> 00:07:04.56
And we heard a lot about Patton while we were working with the one one AD because the

74
00:07:04.56 --> 00:07:10.48
guy is the kind of the foremost tanker.

75
00:07:10.48 --> 00:07:16.40
And even me, I grew up with Patton because the George C Scott movie was released when

76
00:07:16.40 --> 00:07:18.16
I was a kid.

77
00:07:18.16 --> 00:07:26.96
And to this day, I remember watching that for the first time and being, you know, aw,

78
00:07:26.96 --> 00:07:29.56
struck my paton.

79
00:07:29.56 --> 00:07:33.76
And when you stick your hand into a bunch of goo that a moment ago was your best

80
00:07:33.76 --> 00:07:40.08
friend's face, then you'll know what to do.

81
00:07:40.08 --> 00:07:41.08
That's all.

82
00:07:41.08 --> 00:07:44.80
And so that was just a, that's how I grew up.

83
00:07:44.80 --> 00:07:45.80
I mean, I grew up.

84
00:07:45.80 --> 00:07:47.20
I don't watch that movie so many times.

85
00:07:47.20 --> 00:07:48.44
I can't even remember.

86
00:07:48.44 --> 00:07:50.32
Do you still watch it?

87
00:07:50.32 --> 00:07:52.32
We watched it in Ramadi.

88
00:07:52.32 --> 00:07:53.32
We watched it in Ramadi.

89
00:07:53.32 --> 00:07:54.32
What?

90
00:07:54.32 --> 00:07:58.32
Just to get fired up.

91
00:07:58.32 --> 00:08:01.48
And it is a great movie.

92
00:08:01.48 --> 00:08:06.44
Let's talk about the real Patton who actually in many ways was more colorful and more

93
00:08:06.44 --> 00:08:13.64
charismatic and really larger in life and real life than George C Scott and the movie could

94
00:08:13.64 --> 00:08:16.36
make him out to be.

95
00:08:16.36 --> 00:08:22.12
I read that he would when he'd talk and stuff he'd swear a lot.

96
00:08:22.12 --> 00:08:25.76
He used a lot of profanity, but he did that on purpose.

97
00:08:25.76 --> 00:08:30.48
He did it like to send a message or to get his guy fired up, but in regular conversation,

98
00:08:30.48 --> 00:08:31.92
he didn't really swear.

99
00:08:31.92 --> 00:08:37.68
He's a mysterious guy with a lot of different facets to him.

100
00:08:37.68 --> 00:08:40.44
So I'm going to kick this off.

101
00:08:40.44 --> 00:08:45.64
So we're going to the book, George S. Patton.

102
00:08:45.64 --> 00:08:48.60
War as I knew it.

103
00:08:48.60 --> 00:08:55.88
And interestingly, this book was given to me by life, life babin who wrote extreme ownership

104
00:08:55.88 --> 00:08:57.84
with me and who served with me in Ramadi.

105
00:08:57.84 --> 00:09:00.52
And as I want to my brothers.

106
00:09:00.52 --> 00:09:08.72
So General Order number 18.

107
00:09:08.72 --> 00:09:11.000
This is from Patton to his troops.

108
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.64
Soldiers of the seventh army.

109
00:09:14.64 --> 00:09:19.12
Born at sea, baptized in blood and crowned with victory.

110
00:09:19.12 --> 00:09:24.36
In the course of 38 days of incestant battle and unceasing labor, you have added a glorious

111
00:09:24.36 --> 00:09:27.60
chapter to the history of war.

112
00:09:27.60 --> 00:09:33.04
After it against the best Germans and Italians could offer, you have been unfailingly

113
00:09:33.04 --> 00:09:34.32
successful.

114
00:09:34.32 --> 00:09:39.84
The rapidity of your dash, which culminated in the capture of Palermo, was equaled by the

115
00:09:39.84 --> 00:09:45.28
dog and tenacity with which you stormed Chenea and captured Messina.

116
00:09:45.28 --> 00:09:47.96
Every man in the army deserves equal credit.

117
00:09:47.96 --> 00:09:53.20
The enduring valor of the infantry and the impetus forosity of the tanks were matched

118
00:09:53.20 --> 00:09:57.32
by the tyros clamor of our destroying guns.

119
00:09:57.32 --> 00:10:01.76
The engineers prefering prodigies in the construction and maintenance of impossible roads over

120
00:10:01.76 --> 00:10:03.84
impossible country.

121
00:10:03.84 --> 00:10:06.96
The services of maintenance to supply performed a miracle.

122
00:10:06.96 --> 00:10:12.28
The signal correlate over 10,000 miles of wire and the medical department evacuated

123
00:10:12.28 --> 00:10:15.000
and cared for our second wounded.

124
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.04
On all occasions, the Navy has given generous and gallant support.

125
00:10:19.04 --> 00:10:22.76
Throughout the operation, our air has kept the sky clear and tirelessly supported the

126
00:10:22.76 --> 00:10:26.72
operation of the ground troops.

127
00:10:26.72 --> 00:10:34.72
As a result of this combined effort, you have killed or captured 113,350 enemy troops.

128
00:10:34.72 --> 00:10:45.20
You've destroyed 265 of his tanks, 2324 vehicles and 1162 large guns and in addition,

129
00:10:45.20 --> 00:10:50.24
you have collected a mass of military booty running to the hundreds of tons.

130
00:10:50.24 --> 00:10:55.04
But your victory has a significance be above and beyond its physical aspect.

131
00:10:55.04 --> 00:10:58.32
You have destroyed the prestige of the enemy.

132
00:10:58.32 --> 00:11:03.12
The president of the United States, the Secretary of War, the Chief of Staff, General

133
00:11:03.12 --> 00:11:09.28
Eisenhower, General Alexander, General Montgomery have all congratulated you.

134
00:11:09.28 --> 00:11:11.80
Your fame shall never die.

135
00:11:11.80 --> 00:11:18.32
GS Patton, Jr., who attended General U.S. Army, commanding.

136
00:11:18.32 --> 00:11:21.76
So you were talking about getting fired up and what do you do to get fired up?

137
00:11:21.76 --> 00:11:22.76
Mm-hmm.

138
00:11:22.76 --> 00:11:23.76
There you have it.

139
00:11:23.76 --> 00:11:24.76
Yeah.

140
00:11:24.76 --> 00:11:31.20
Obviously a very skilled writer with great command of the language.

141
00:11:31.20 --> 00:11:36.84
Can you even imagine what you'd feel like hearing that address to you and your people

142
00:11:36.84 --> 00:11:43.28
and your troops, your brothers?

143
00:11:43.28 --> 00:11:45.72
A little bit about Patton.

144
00:11:45.72 --> 00:11:51.000
Few military figures in history have laid siege to the public imagination more relentlessly

145
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.40
than George S. Patton, Jr.

146
00:11:53.40 --> 00:11:58.92
Half a century after his exploits in North Africa on Sicily and across occupied Europe,

147
00:11:58.92 --> 00:12:03.76
his name still evokes the dash and brue of a cavalry charge.

148
00:12:03.76 --> 00:12:10.04
He is widely considered the best field commander in the American Army of World War II and

149
00:12:10.04 --> 00:12:15.32
he is certainly one of the most feared by the Germans who paid him the compliment before

150
00:12:15.32 --> 00:12:21.28
normity of massing defenses against a non-existent Army Patton group.

151
00:12:21.28 --> 00:12:30.64
By V.E. Day, in 1945, he commanded 18 divisions and 540,000 soldiers, a force comparable to

152
00:12:30.64 --> 00:12:37.000
the size of the American military at its peak in Vietnam.

153
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.80
The New York Times declared in his obituary history has reached out and embraced General

154
00:12:42.80 --> 00:12:43.92
George Patton.

155
00:12:43.92 --> 00:12:46.12
His place is secure.

156
00:12:46.12 --> 00:12:51.96
He was not a man of peace.

157
00:12:51.96 --> 00:12:58.24
A man of peace, he was not, but his legacy clearly transcends his military conquest.

158
00:12:58.24 --> 00:13:04.000
He was complex and contradictory, larger than life, and yet all to human.

159
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.56
It is the Patton paradox that trans fixes.

160
00:13:06.56 --> 00:13:10.16
This is something that we've talked about before I'm as podcast and something that I talk

161
00:13:10.16 --> 00:13:11.16
about all the time.

162
00:13:11.16 --> 00:13:14.36
And that is, people's strengths can be their weaknesses.

163
00:13:14.36 --> 00:13:17.72
And you get a guy like Patton who is hyper- regressive.

164
00:13:17.72 --> 00:13:22.000
And that actually ends up being a negative in some cases, even though it's extremely positive

165
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
in others.

166
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.88
Back to the book, a warlord fighting in the name of democracy.

167
00:13:28.88 --> 00:13:34.60
He was also an unrepent aristocratic snob.

168
00:13:34.60 --> 00:13:40.96
So this is a guy that, and they talk about this some more, but a guy that was like proud

169
00:13:40.96 --> 00:13:42.56
of soldiers.

170
00:13:42.56 --> 00:13:48.72
Almost to a fault, he revered soldiers, and yet he's an aristocrat.

171
00:13:48.72 --> 00:13:54.72
His devotion to common soldiers bordered on reverence, yet his slapping of two enlisted men

172
00:13:54.72 --> 00:13:57.32
nearly caused him to sit out the war and disgrace.

173
00:13:57.32 --> 00:14:02.96
And we'll get into that a little bit more.

174
00:14:02.96 --> 00:14:08.04
He exuded confidence and relentlessly servitude.

175
00:14:08.04 --> 00:14:12.12
In truth, he was insecure and often confused.

176
00:14:12.12 --> 00:14:19.68
He was well-read, fluent in French, and as a wealthy child of privilege and the husband

177
00:14:19.68 --> 00:14:25.32
of an eras, at home in societies most fashionable salons.

178
00:14:25.32 --> 00:14:30.52
He could also be crude, rude, and plain foolish.

179
00:14:30.52 --> 00:14:37.68
His humility seemed heartfelt, yet he acknowledged and overdeveloped personal ambition.

180
00:14:37.68 --> 00:14:45.44
And once confessed, I don't like the dirt at all except as a means to fame.

181
00:14:45.44 --> 00:14:47.56
So I said this guy is a complex guy.

182
00:14:47.56 --> 00:14:49.68
This isn't a salt of the earth.

183
00:14:49.68 --> 00:14:52.96
David Hackworth guy that you never got that from him.

184
00:14:52.96 --> 00:15:00.36
You never got that guy like Hackworth that he had any sort of quest for glory.

185
00:15:00.36 --> 00:15:02.56
He just complete opposite.

186
00:15:02.56 --> 00:15:07.000
And that's why patent for me is not a pure figure.

187
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.60
You know, not that I would really say that I can think of any pure figures, but he's

188
00:15:11.60 --> 00:15:17.96
definitely a very faulted leader and which makes it good to learn from.

189
00:15:17.96 --> 00:15:18.96
And he had some of them, man.

190
00:15:18.96 --> 00:15:27.96
I mean, obviously, here I am, a complete idiot loser sitting here calling, you know, General

191
00:15:27.96 --> 00:15:31.000
George Jass Pat, George Jass Pat and say he's faulted leader.

192
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.76
So don't get me wrong here.

193
00:15:33.76 --> 00:15:41.20
The guy was unbelievably powerful leader and incredible leader and incredible tactician

194
00:15:41.20 --> 00:15:42.88
and strategist.

195
00:15:42.88 --> 00:15:49.44
But it is very clear that he had some of those dichotomies that went a little bit too

196
00:15:49.44 --> 00:15:53.44
far and one way or the other.

197
00:15:53.44 --> 00:15:59.60
As a warrior back to the book, as a warrior, his fundamental prescription for waging war

198
00:15:59.60 --> 00:16:04.76
involved the violent attacks everywhere with everything.

199
00:16:04.76 --> 00:16:09.72
Yet he considered the carpet bombing of German cities to be barbaric, useless, and

200
00:16:09.72 --> 00:16:10.72
statistic.

201
00:16:10.72 --> 00:16:12.72
So that's a contradiction.

202
00:16:12.72 --> 00:16:15.08
Don't hear very much about him.

203
00:16:15.08 --> 00:16:18.56
And here's how you've seen by the higher ups a little bit.

204
00:16:18.56 --> 00:16:26.12
Eisenhower, who once referred to Paton as this mentally unbalanced officer, also told

205
00:16:26.12 --> 00:16:32.04
George Marshall, Paton is a problem child, but he is great.

206
00:16:32.04 --> 00:16:36.64
He is a great fighting leader in pursuit and exploitation.

207
00:16:36.64 --> 00:16:42.72
A division commander described the general as invaluable and war, but a disturbing element

208
00:16:42.72 --> 00:16:45.24
in times of peace.

209
00:16:45.24 --> 00:16:49.52
And to that, Paton was flattered.

210
00:16:49.52 --> 00:16:54.32
But perhaps the epitaph you would treasure most came from one of his soldiers before the Allied

211
00:16:54.32 --> 00:16:56.56
invasion of France.

212
00:16:56.56 --> 00:17:00.20
Here is a man for whom you would go to Hellenbach.

213
00:17:00.20 --> 00:17:08.64
So clearly to his troops, they held him in very high regard.

214
00:17:08.64 --> 00:17:12.32
Quote from Paton, may God have mercy on my enemies.

215
00:17:12.32 --> 00:17:14.84
They will need it.

216
00:17:14.84 --> 00:17:20.04
That's the kind of thing that when he says people, you know, the front line to you,

217
00:17:20.04 --> 00:17:23.44
which I'm going to hear that and say, yes, we are ready to roll.

218
00:17:23.44 --> 00:17:27.84
He also said leadership is a thing that wins battles.

219
00:17:27.84 --> 00:17:33.96
I have it, but I'll be damned if I can define it.

220
00:17:33.96 --> 00:17:38.48
In Paton's career, we see certain trademarks are relentless aggression and faith in the

221
00:17:38.48 --> 00:17:45.92
offensive and uncanny instinct for enemy intentions and disposition.

222
00:17:45.92 --> 00:17:50.12
Common theme that we talk about all the time, being on offense, being aggressive and

223
00:17:50.12 --> 00:17:58.28
patent was an absolute, probably, I think he is probably the most aggressive of the people

224
00:17:58.28 --> 00:17:59.28
that we've talked about.

225
00:17:59.28 --> 00:18:06.72
And of pretty much, I think of anyone I've ever heard of.

226
00:18:06.72 --> 00:18:10.12
And it goes a little bit negative.

227
00:18:10.12 --> 00:18:17.000
And we see to the creeping arrogance, the hubris, which would cost the American army so

228
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.72
dearly in Vietnam, summing up the achievements of his troops and crushing the German counter

229
00:18:22.72 --> 00:18:31.12
attack of December 1944, patent with parnerable pride, claims to have moved farther and faster

230
00:18:31.12 --> 00:18:36.24
and engaged more divisions in less time than any other army in the history of the United

231
00:18:36.24 --> 00:18:43.92
States, possibly in the history of the world, no country can stand against such an army.

232
00:18:43.92 --> 00:18:49.16
This smug pride, the disease of victory, and I love that.

233
00:18:49.16 --> 00:18:52.60
That's a little something we should all remember.

234
00:18:52.60 --> 00:18:58.48
The disease of victory, victory, supposed to be all positive, but guess what?

235
00:18:58.48 --> 00:19:03.52
There's something called the disease of victory.

236
00:19:03.52 --> 00:19:08.76
Back to the book, this disease of victory would rot the army from within, leading future

237
00:19:08.76 --> 00:19:13.48
commanders to underestimate their enemies and to overestimate their own battlefield

238
00:19:13.48 --> 00:19:15.72
prowess.

239
00:19:15.72 --> 00:19:27.72
Tragically, the only antidote to this disease of victory would be the humiliation of defeat.

240
00:19:27.72 --> 00:19:31.36
We see that sometimes in sports, it all happens.

241
00:19:31.36 --> 00:19:34.92
We see in sports, we see it in business.

242
00:19:34.92 --> 00:19:37.60
Sometimes people need to get humbled.

243
00:19:37.60 --> 00:19:42.16
And when they get humbled, they get arrogant from the victories and then they get humbled

244
00:19:42.16 --> 00:19:47.32
and they get back in the game and they realize what they have to do to win.

245
00:19:47.32 --> 00:19:53.000
Back to the book, his passion for military life ran so deep that he considered it as natural

246
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.84
for me to be a soldier as to breathe.

247
00:19:57.84 --> 00:20:07.16
War he claimed is the only place where a man really lives.

248
00:20:07.16 --> 00:20:12.36
He earned a keen interest in technological developments of armored vehicles and airplanes.

249
00:20:12.36 --> 00:20:18.52
He retained a near-finanical belief in the importance of being mentally and physically ready

250
00:20:18.52 --> 00:20:20.88
to fight.

251
00:20:20.88 --> 00:20:25.56
Even in war where he 1920s, he had managed junior officers.

252
00:20:25.56 --> 00:20:33.80
You must school yourself to savagery.

253
00:20:33.80 --> 00:20:36.92
And speaking of savagery.

254
00:20:36.92 --> 00:20:46.48
This is the slaps when he slapped these young enlisted troopers.

255
00:20:46.48 --> 00:20:49.88
The infamous slaps her round the world.

256
00:20:49.88 --> 00:20:55.64
Patent's memoir gives the episode short-shrift.

257
00:20:55.64 --> 00:20:58.20
But it nearly wrecked his life.

258
00:20:58.20 --> 00:21:03.000
In early August, while visiting wounded troops on Sicily, the commander cuffed a soldier

259
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.60
who had been diagnosed as suffering from battle fatigue.

260
00:21:06.60 --> 00:21:09.000
Patent called cowardice.

261
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.08
Further examination revealed the man had malaria and dysentery.

262
00:21:14.08 --> 00:21:18.28
A week later, Patent repeated his behavior with another soldier.

263
00:21:18.28 --> 00:21:27.56
And this time made motions to draw his pistol as if to shoot the wretch.

264
00:21:27.56 --> 00:21:33.000
Patent publicly apologized, but remained privately unrepidant.

265
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.40
And other officers had the courage to do likewise.

266
00:21:36.40 --> 00:21:42.32
He wrote, the shameful use of battle fatigue is an excuse for cowardice.

267
00:21:42.32 --> 00:21:50.28
Would have been infinitely reduced.

268
00:21:50.28 --> 00:21:54.88
So that was a significant incident.

269
00:21:54.88 --> 00:21:59.80
At he, you know, he publicly apologized, but he obviously didn't really mean that.

270
00:21:59.80 --> 00:22:02.72
He felt he had done the right thing.

271
00:22:02.72 --> 00:22:05.28
But still there was much glory to be one.

272
00:22:05.28 --> 00:22:10.20
Patent's exploiting the battle of the bulge abruptly whaling his army around and driving

273
00:22:10.20 --> 00:22:16.88
100 miles through the icy ardenes to hit the Germans in the flank with 17 divisions

274
00:22:16.88 --> 00:22:23.92
remains among the most storied campaigns in modern warfare.

275
00:22:23.92 --> 00:22:32.68
And then after the war, as Europe was now almost an occupied state in many places.

276
00:22:32.68 --> 00:22:42.48
And as people talked about patent being good for war, but not being good for peace and

277
00:22:42.48 --> 00:22:45.000
that turned out to be pretty accurate.

278
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.68
No longer able to adapt.

279
00:22:47.68 --> 00:22:51.000
He indeed became boyous.

280
00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:03.24
And was arrogant, defiant, and erratic as the summer of 1945 passed.

281
00:23:03.24 --> 00:23:07.40
And that's kind of the intro and patent.

282
00:23:07.40 --> 00:23:16.52
Now going back now to the beginning of the war.

283
00:23:16.52 --> 00:23:25.04
And his first, one of his early journal entries, he says, have been giving everyone a simplified

284
00:23:25.04 --> 00:23:27.64
directive of war.

285
00:23:27.64 --> 00:23:30.32
Use steam roller strategy.

286
00:23:30.32 --> 00:23:36.52
That is, make up your mind on course and direction of action and stick to it.

287
00:23:36.52 --> 00:23:44.40
But in tactics, do not steam roller, attack weakness, hold them by the nose and kick them

288
00:23:44.40 --> 00:23:46.36
in the pants.

289
00:23:46.36 --> 00:23:49.20
This is something that we talk about all the time.

290
00:23:49.20 --> 00:23:50.80
It's flanking people.

291
00:23:50.80 --> 00:23:56.04
It's not going into their strengths and keep attacking their strengths.

292
00:23:56.04 --> 00:24:01.44
No, you attack their strengths to keep them occupied.

293
00:24:01.44 --> 00:24:03.04
But then you come around to the flank.

294
00:24:03.04 --> 00:24:06.76
It's in Gigiitsu, you attack the arm and you get the neck or you attack the neck and you

295
00:24:06.76 --> 00:24:08.84
get the arm.

296
00:24:08.84 --> 00:24:10.92
In combat, it's flanking.

297
00:24:10.92 --> 00:24:11.92
That's what it is.

298
00:24:11.92 --> 00:24:18.72
And he was a master of this and pushed it very, very hard.

299
00:24:18.72 --> 00:24:33.92
Now we can get into a little bit more of his, what he says are his reflections and suggestions.

300
00:24:33.92 --> 00:24:41.32
And if in this book, if you, if you do end up getting this book, I'm basically skipping

301
00:24:41.32 --> 00:24:43.76
the war part.

302
00:24:43.76 --> 00:24:48.44
The entire book is about what he did and how he did it.

303
00:24:48.44 --> 00:24:50.08
And I'm skipping that.

304
00:24:50.08 --> 00:24:54.04
And I've said this before because I like to know about what they did and how they did it

305
00:24:54.04 --> 00:24:56.20
because that is important.

306
00:24:56.20 --> 00:24:59.88
But I like to know why they did it and what they were thinking and what principles they were

307
00:24:59.88 --> 00:25:02.20
following in this book, beautifully breaks it down.

308
00:25:02.20 --> 00:25:04.40
Again, it's written by him.

309
00:25:04.40 --> 00:25:09.72
But it breaks down what he was thinking, why he did take these actions and what his strategies

310
00:25:09.72 --> 00:25:14.60
and tactics were.

311
00:25:14.60 --> 00:25:18.80
And this is great because he starts off saying something that's very similar to what

312
00:25:18.80 --> 00:25:22.84
life and I say in the beginning of our book, which is like we didn't invent this stuff.

313
00:25:22.84 --> 00:25:26.12
So here's General George Aspat and saying the same thing.

314
00:25:26.12 --> 00:25:31.96
Probably there is nothing original in what I shall now put down because war is an ancient

315
00:25:31.96 --> 00:25:33.24
subject.

316
00:25:33.24 --> 00:25:39.36
And I, an ancient man, has studied and practiced it for over 40 years.

317
00:25:39.36 --> 00:25:45.76
So what appears to me as original thought may be simply subconscious memories.

318
00:25:45.76 --> 00:25:50.28
So he's saying, I didn't necessarily think of all this.

319
00:25:50.28 --> 00:25:56.16
Then late for night in the beginning of our book say the same thing.

320
00:25:56.16 --> 00:26:01.24
Concerning the soldier, the soldier is the army.

321
00:26:01.24 --> 00:26:04.12
No army is better than its soldiers.

322
00:26:04.12 --> 00:26:10.16
The soldier is also a citizen. In fact, the highest obligation and privilege of citizenship

323
00:26:10.16 --> 00:26:13.92
is that of bearing arms for one's country.

324
00:26:13.92 --> 00:26:19.12
Hence, it is a privilege to be a soldier, a good soldier.

325
00:26:19.12 --> 00:26:26.000
To be a good soldier, a man must have discipline, self-respect, pride in his unit and his

326
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
country.

327
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.80
A high sense of duty and obligation to his comrades and to his superiors and self-confidence

328
00:26:32.80 --> 00:26:37.80
and born of demonstrated ability.

329
00:26:37.80 --> 00:26:47.04
His number one characteristic was discipline, which should come as no surprise.

330
00:26:47.04 --> 00:26:52.44
There has been and is now a great deal of talk about discipline.

331
00:26:52.44 --> 00:27:02.76
But few people in or out of the army know what it is or why it is necessary.

332
00:27:02.76 --> 00:27:08.20
No sane man is unafraid in battle.

333
00:27:08.20 --> 00:27:14.84
But discipline produces in him a form of vicarious courage, which, with his manhood, makes

334
00:27:14.84 --> 00:27:16.84
for victory.

335
00:27:16.84 --> 00:27:22.20
Self-respect grows directly from discipline.

336
00:27:22.20 --> 00:27:28.60
Self-confidence, the greatest military virtue, results from the demonstrated ability derived

337
00:27:28.60 --> 00:27:37.12
from the acquisition of all the preceding qualities and from exercise in the use of weapons.

338
00:27:37.12 --> 00:27:41.48
So self-confidence comes from practice and skill.

339
00:27:41.48 --> 00:27:45.72
And that's derived from discipline.

340
00:27:45.72 --> 00:27:50.08
Discipline is clearly a subject we talk about quite a bit.

341
00:27:50.08 --> 00:27:57.20
And it's important in the military is cannot be overstated.

342
00:27:57.20 --> 00:27:58.40
It really can't be.

343
00:27:58.40 --> 00:28:06.80
And I would go so far as to tell you that discipline is important and life cannot be overstated.

344
00:28:06.80 --> 00:28:17.28
The root of all good characteristics is the discipline.

345
00:28:17.28 --> 00:28:21.44
Battles are won by fire and by movement.

346
00:28:21.44 --> 00:28:27.32
The purpose of movement is to get the fire in a more advantageous place to play on the

347
00:28:27.32 --> 00:28:29.04
enemy.

348
00:28:29.04 --> 00:28:30.88
This is from the rear or the flank.

349
00:28:30.88 --> 00:28:33.64
You can hear this guy talk about flanks all the time.

350
00:28:33.64 --> 00:28:35.44
He's going to talk about fire moves.

351
00:28:35.44 --> 00:28:40.56
He's going to talk about cover move as life and I call that narbuck.

352
00:28:40.56 --> 00:28:41.88
Cover move.

353
00:28:41.88 --> 00:28:46.88
And this is again, this is teamwork.

354
00:28:46.88 --> 00:28:53.48
Teamwork constantly working with your team and your other teams that are with you to make

355
00:28:53.48 --> 00:28:57.44
sure that if I'm putting down cover fire, you're moving.

356
00:28:57.44 --> 00:28:58.44
You're moving.

357
00:28:58.44 --> 00:29:01.12
And when you're putting down cover fire, I'm moving.

358
00:29:01.12 --> 00:29:04.08
You've got to work together to make that happen.

359
00:29:04.08 --> 00:29:10.36
And every business in the world has multiple little units in it that have to cover

360
00:29:10.36 --> 00:29:14.24
and move.

361
00:29:14.24 --> 00:29:18.28
Talking about bravery and courage.

362
00:29:18.28 --> 00:29:26.12
If we take the generally accepted definition of bravery as a quality which knows not fear,

363
00:29:26.12 --> 00:29:28.68
I have never seen a brave man.

364
00:29:28.68 --> 00:29:30.24
All men are frightened.

365
00:29:30.24 --> 00:29:33.72
The more intelligent they are, the more frightened they are.

366
00:29:33.72 --> 00:29:42.28
The courageous man is the man who forces himself in spite of his fear to carry on.

367
00:29:42.28 --> 00:29:44.72
And where does that come from?

368
00:29:44.72 --> 00:29:52.92
It comes from discipline, pride, self respect, self confidence and the love of glory are

369
00:29:52.92 --> 00:29:57.28
attributes which will make a man courageous even when he is afraid.

370
00:29:57.28 --> 00:29:58.28
There's not too many people.

371
00:29:58.28 --> 00:30:04.28
I mean, you would hack worth would never talk about the love of glory and just not his

372
00:30:04.28 --> 00:30:07.12
deal, not his deal.

373
00:30:07.12 --> 00:30:14.68
When you mentioned about bravery, how you were talking with Sam Harris about it, where

374
00:30:14.68 --> 00:30:19.44
bravery is only present if you are scared of something because if you're not scared of it,

375
00:30:19.44 --> 00:30:27.20
you're not being brave till overcome anything or to go to do any kind of activity that's

376
00:30:27.20 --> 00:30:28.20
you're scared of.

377
00:30:28.20 --> 00:30:33.92
So the very, although I don't know if I necessarily agree with that because there's guys

378
00:30:33.92 --> 00:30:37.88
that are, he says he's never seen anyone that's not afraid.

379
00:30:37.88 --> 00:30:39.76
I see him pretty cool.

380
00:30:39.76 --> 00:30:41.24
I mean, it's almost the word to use.

381
00:30:41.24 --> 00:30:42.56
It's crazy.

382
00:30:42.56 --> 00:30:50.80
As it are just so brave in you look at him and you go, this guy's going to sky.

383
00:30:50.80 --> 00:31:01.80
I had guys with me, you know, in my task unit and some of those guys were so brave that

384
00:31:01.80 --> 00:31:05.52
I didn't think they were going to make it home.

385
00:31:05.52 --> 00:31:11.16
And is it because they were like, it's like they weren't scared to die at all.

386
00:31:11.16 --> 00:31:14.000
I could do it.

387
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:25.12
And you see the almost a lack of self preservation, you know, not stupid, not suicidal.

388
00:31:25.12 --> 00:31:27.48
But like, oh, this guy doesn't think he can be killed.

389
00:31:27.48 --> 00:31:29.80
You know, we were talking about that on the last podcast.

390
00:31:29.80 --> 00:31:34.44
I never forget the name of the major that was on the beach landing at Toro, I think, and

391
00:31:34.44 --> 00:31:36.36
he's up and he's like, hey, look, they can't hit me.

392
00:31:36.36 --> 00:31:37.36
Come on.

393
00:31:37.36 --> 00:31:38.36
Yeah.

394
00:31:38.36 --> 00:31:40.08
I've seen guys do that.

395
00:31:40.08 --> 00:31:41.08
Yeah.

396
00:31:41.08 --> 00:31:48.36
So as far as actual bravery goes though, so would you consider that, like, let's say,

397
00:31:48.36 --> 00:31:52.64
okay, two guys are going to go, go do some, let's say an MMA fight, right?

398
00:31:52.64 --> 00:31:58.12
And one guy's just really scared of competing in front of people.

399
00:31:58.12 --> 00:31:59.40
It's his first fight or something like that.

400
00:31:59.40 --> 00:32:02.000
Then you have this other guy who's not, who just feels different.

401
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.08
Same exact situation, but he's like fired up.

402
00:32:04.08 --> 00:32:06.28
He's not scared at all.

403
00:32:06.28 --> 00:32:11.28
And they both go into it.

404
00:32:11.28 --> 00:32:13.28
Do they both exercise the same bravery?

405
00:32:13.28 --> 00:32:14.28
Yeah, I don't know.

406
00:32:14.28 --> 00:32:16.28
You know, and I don't know if it matters.

407
00:32:16.28 --> 00:32:17.28
Yeah.

408
00:32:17.28 --> 00:32:20.48
For one thing I can tell you, the guy that's acting like he's not scared is probably the one

409
00:32:20.48 --> 00:32:23.48
that's more scared with MMA fights.

410
00:32:23.48 --> 00:32:29.88
And it's an actually, see that combat, two guys that are overly, like, bravado are probably

411
00:32:29.88 --> 00:32:30.88
more scared.

412
00:32:30.88 --> 00:32:32.88
And again, there's nothing wrong with that.

413
00:32:32.88 --> 00:32:34.88
I'm not holding it against him.

414
00:32:34.88 --> 00:32:43.80
But I've seen guys sitting in briefs to go out on operations that you can tell are petrified.

415
00:32:43.80 --> 00:32:44.80
Yeah.

416
00:32:44.80 --> 00:32:49.04
Usually it's a guy that's not used to it.

417
00:32:49.04 --> 00:32:53.44
Maybe someone that's visiting in an area of operations and shows up and it's, oh, we're

418
00:32:53.44 --> 00:32:56.04
going to take you on an operation.

419
00:32:56.04 --> 00:32:57.68
And you get to see them.

420
00:32:57.68 --> 00:33:00.12
They're scared because they're not used to it.

421
00:33:00.12 --> 00:33:04.76
All the guys from my task, you know, they might be scared, but they're confident.

422
00:33:04.76 --> 00:33:05.76
You know what they're doing.

423
00:33:05.76 --> 00:33:06.76
Right.

424
00:33:06.76 --> 00:33:09.52
They've put that fear aside over and over again.

425
00:33:09.52 --> 00:33:12.92
So it's not that big of a deal, but you see a guy dealing with that fear for the first

426
00:33:12.92 --> 00:33:13.92
time.

427
00:33:13.92 --> 00:33:18.68
And especially stands out because you've got a bunch of confident guys that know that understand

428
00:33:18.68 --> 00:33:19.92
that understand the risks.

429
00:33:19.92 --> 00:33:21.08
So you can see their faces.

430
00:33:21.08 --> 00:33:26.24
And then you see like that guy that's coming from another area and is going to go out

431
00:33:26.24 --> 00:33:27.48
in operation.

432
00:33:27.48 --> 00:33:32.52
And their, their tap and their toes during the brief and they're looking around.

433
00:33:32.52 --> 00:33:33.52
Yeah.

434
00:33:33.52 --> 00:33:34.52
And they got to overcome that fear.

435
00:33:34.52 --> 00:33:37.96
And if they stay there for a few weeks, they'll get used to it, too.

436
00:33:37.96 --> 00:33:38.96
Yeah.

437
00:33:38.96 --> 00:33:44.24
So it could kind of be looked at as just the act itself, whatever act, if it's understood

438
00:33:44.24 --> 00:33:45.24
as being.

439
00:33:45.24 --> 00:33:49.24
Sam Harris's point was that it doesn't matter.

440
00:33:49.24 --> 00:33:55.44
If there's a machine gun nest and you're horrified to go charge it and I'm not.

441
00:33:55.44 --> 00:33:57.08
And we both got charged it.

442
00:33:57.08 --> 00:33:59.08
You just had to pretend that you weren't scared.

443
00:33:59.08 --> 00:34:00.08
It doesn't matter.

444
00:34:00.08 --> 00:34:01.08
You still be a brave.

445
00:34:01.08 --> 00:34:02.08
Right.

446
00:34:02.08 --> 00:34:03.08
And I didn't have to pretend.

447
00:34:03.08 --> 00:34:04.08
But I'm being brave.

448
00:34:04.08 --> 00:34:06.52
So it doesn't matter what you're pretending or not.

449
00:34:06.52 --> 00:34:07.84
You're brave if you go.

450
00:34:07.84 --> 00:34:08.84
Right.

451
00:34:08.84 --> 00:34:13.84
And we're maybe just to overcome or do something that's understood generally as being

452
00:34:13.84 --> 00:34:14.84
scary.

453
00:34:14.84 --> 00:34:16.84
Just as not scared.

454
00:34:16.84 --> 00:34:17.84
Yeah.

455
00:34:17.84 --> 00:34:18.84
Yes, scary.

456
00:34:18.84 --> 00:34:19.84
You're still being just as brave.

457
00:34:19.84 --> 00:34:20.84
You are.

458
00:34:20.84 --> 00:34:21.84
But yeah.

459
00:34:21.84 --> 00:34:25.04
And I guess in a real black and white term, it's like, if you're not scared of this activity,

460
00:34:25.04 --> 00:34:26.64
you're doing and you do it.

461
00:34:26.64 --> 00:34:27.84
And you're not scared of it.

462
00:34:27.84 --> 00:34:28.84
And you're not being brave.

463
00:34:28.84 --> 00:34:30.52
And that's just in generally speaking.

464
00:34:30.52 --> 00:34:32.12
Like, you know, it's good example skydivers.

465
00:34:32.12 --> 00:34:33.12
Yeah.

466
00:34:33.12 --> 00:34:36.24
With 5,000 jumps, they're not scared anymore.

467
00:34:36.24 --> 00:34:41.24
I mean, I know even when I've done like 50 jumps, you're not really scared anymore.

468
00:34:41.24 --> 00:34:42.24
You're just doing it.

469
00:34:42.24 --> 00:34:44.44
And guys that have thousands of jumps, they're not scared at all.

470
00:34:44.44 --> 00:34:45.44
That's what they do.

471
00:34:45.44 --> 00:34:46.44
Right.

472
00:34:46.44 --> 00:34:47.44
So they're not being brave.

473
00:34:47.44 --> 00:34:48.44
They're just doing their job.

474
00:34:48.44 --> 00:34:49.44
They're just doing their thing.

475
00:34:49.44 --> 00:34:50.44
Yeah.

476
00:34:50.44 --> 00:34:52.56
So what if some guys jump in out for the first time and he's scared and he

477
00:34:52.56 --> 00:34:53.76
overcomes that fear and jumps out.

478
00:34:53.76 --> 00:34:54.76
He is being brave.

479
00:34:54.76 --> 00:34:55.76
Yeah.

480
00:34:55.76 --> 00:34:56.76
Right.

481
00:34:56.76 --> 00:34:57.76
So yeah, this kind of a point.

482
00:34:57.76 --> 00:34:58.76
Yeah.

483
00:34:58.76 --> 00:34:59.76
So if I go outside and check the mail, I'm not being brave.

484
00:34:59.76 --> 00:35:00.76
No, you're not doing brave.

485
00:35:00.76 --> 00:35:03.08
But what if there's like a tiger or something out there?

486
00:35:03.08 --> 00:35:04.08
And I really want to be brave.

487
00:35:04.08 --> 00:35:05.08
That's pretty brave.

488
00:35:05.08 --> 00:35:06.08
Right.

489
00:35:06.08 --> 00:35:08.08
Tigers going after tigers.

490
00:35:08.08 --> 00:35:09.08
Yeah.

491
00:35:09.08 --> 00:35:10.08
Yeah.

492
00:35:10.08 --> 00:35:13.08
You're right.

493
00:35:13.08 --> 00:35:14.08
Section here.

494
00:35:14.08 --> 00:35:15.08
Small unit tactics.

495
00:35:15.08 --> 00:35:17.76
Hey, you guys question to whether I wanted to put this in there.

496
00:35:17.76 --> 00:35:21.08
But I know that I'm getting a lot of feedback from guys that are in the military.

497
00:35:21.08 --> 00:35:23.08
You guys that are in SWAT.

498
00:35:23.08 --> 00:35:25.96
And this is something that I used to talk about.

499
00:35:25.96 --> 00:35:28.20
And I know it's true.

500
00:35:28.20 --> 00:35:30.40
Squads should seldom be split.

501
00:35:30.40 --> 00:35:33.16
So you want to keep your forces together as much as possible.

502
00:35:33.16 --> 00:35:38.84
However, if it isn't necessary to split a squad, be sure that the unit separated as

503
00:35:38.84 --> 00:35:40.64
at least capable of mutual support.

504
00:35:40.64 --> 00:35:42.60
So this is something I used to hammer the seals about it.

505
00:35:42.60 --> 00:35:46.40
You get too far away from your other unit where you can't support them anymore.

506
00:35:46.40 --> 00:35:48.16
That's problematic now.

507
00:35:48.16 --> 00:35:49.76
Now that other units alone.

508
00:35:49.76 --> 00:35:53.44
And that means that each unit that separates should have the ability to support.

509
00:35:53.44 --> 00:35:55.92
It means it has to have some firepower and some strength.

510
00:35:55.92 --> 00:35:59.84
This means that the unit separated from the squad should have not fewer than three

511
00:35:59.84 --> 00:36:01.16
men.

512
00:36:01.16 --> 00:36:07.24
The squad possesses in itself weapons necessary for a base and fire and maneuvering element.

513
00:36:07.24 --> 00:36:08.24
This should be an...

514
00:36:08.24 --> 00:36:09.24
This should be...

515
00:36:09.24 --> 00:36:10.24
This should be...

516
00:36:10.24 --> 00:36:12.04
It's in variable method of attack.

517
00:36:12.04 --> 00:36:17.12
But the squad leader should not spend so much time thinking which way he is going to

518
00:36:17.12 --> 00:36:22.96
develop that he suffers casualties which would have been avoided had he attacked at once.

519
00:36:22.96 --> 00:36:29.08
So don't hesitate, don't sit around when it's time to get it on.

520
00:36:29.08 --> 00:36:36.92
Patents all about the taking action.

521
00:36:36.92 --> 00:36:39.72
Another small unit tactic.

522
00:36:39.72 --> 00:36:42.04
This is a short one.

523
00:36:42.04 --> 00:36:48.000
Always capture the highest terrain feature in your vicinity at once and stay on it.

524
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.36
And that is something that we executed all the time in Ramadhi.

525
00:36:52.36 --> 00:36:55.48
Get in the high ground, get in those buildings, find the three story building amongst

526
00:36:55.48 --> 00:36:59.92
the two story building, find the two story building amongst the one story building.

527
00:36:59.92 --> 00:37:02.96
Always looking for that high ground.

528
00:37:02.96 --> 00:37:08.84
In the rural areas, any kind of no one can bump anything that gives you the high ground.

529
00:37:08.84 --> 00:37:10.48
He isn't what you're looking for.

530
00:37:10.48 --> 00:37:16.84
And as I said last time, from an ethical and from a moral standpoint, take the high ground

531
00:37:16.84 --> 00:37:17.84
or the high ground.

532
00:37:17.84 --> 00:37:19.84
I'm gonna take you.

533
00:37:19.84 --> 00:37:26.96
You gotta watch out for that.

534
00:37:26.96 --> 00:37:29.36
Don't delay.

535
00:37:29.36 --> 00:37:32.80
The best is the enemy of the good.

536
00:37:32.80 --> 00:37:36.88
And these are, I mean, that's just a common saying now.

537
00:37:36.88 --> 00:37:39.08
The best is the enemy of the good.

538
00:37:39.08 --> 00:37:44.68
By this I mean, that a good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan

539
00:37:44.68 --> 00:37:46.40
next week.

540
00:37:46.40 --> 00:37:52.32
More is a very simple thing and the determining characteristics are self-confidence, speed,

541
00:37:52.32 --> 00:37:54.000
and audacity.

542
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.76
None of these things can ever be perfect, but they can be good.

543
00:37:58.76 --> 00:38:04.04
He's talking about now general officers, meaning the senior leaders.

544
00:38:04.04 --> 00:38:08.32
And he's applied to every unit, not just senior leaders.

545
00:38:08.32 --> 00:38:12.28
There are more tired division commanders than there are tired divisions.

546
00:38:12.28 --> 00:38:16.20
Tired officers are always pessimists.

547
00:38:16.20 --> 00:38:18.96
Remember this when evaluating reports.

548
00:38:18.96 --> 00:38:23.44
Generals must never show doubt, discouragement or fatigue.

549
00:38:23.44 --> 00:38:28.68
Generals should always adhere to one type of dress so that soldiers will recognize them.

550
00:38:28.68 --> 00:38:31.48
They must always be very neat.

551
00:38:31.48 --> 00:38:35.44
And most importantly, for my perspective, I like what he says here.

552
00:38:35.44 --> 00:38:39.92
In cold weather, general officers must be careful not to appear to dress more warmly

553
00:38:39.92 --> 00:38:43.52
than the men.

554
00:38:43.52 --> 00:38:47.52
You don't want to do that. You don't want to be in the comfort zone when the boys are

555
00:38:47.52 --> 00:38:48.52
suffering.

556
00:38:48.52 --> 00:38:49.52
You look like you're debating.

557
00:38:49.52 --> 00:38:50.52
No, no, no, no, I'm not debating.

558
00:38:50.52 --> 00:38:51.52
I was thinking about it.

559
00:38:51.52 --> 00:38:52.52
I'm not thinking about it.

560
00:38:52.52 --> 00:38:53.52
I'm thinking about to get shut down.

561
00:38:53.52 --> 00:38:54.52
I'm the question.

562
00:38:54.52 --> 00:38:55.52
Send the question.

563
00:38:55.52 --> 00:38:59.52
So let's say you're a boss, right?

564
00:38:59.52 --> 00:39:03.52
You have this office and this office is like decked up.

565
00:39:03.52 --> 00:39:06.52
Meanwhile, everyone on your team may have normal offices.

566
00:39:06.52 --> 00:39:08.52
Is that an example of what he's against?

567
00:39:08.52 --> 00:39:12.52
No, generally because you actually do have more work to do.

568
00:39:12.52 --> 00:39:15.52
You have you have to have meetings in your office.

569
00:39:15.52 --> 00:39:21.52
And, and it's interesting, too, because I didn't highlight it in this for this series,

570
00:39:21.52 --> 00:39:26.52
but they were saying that general patent wasn't a four star general.

571
00:39:26.52 --> 00:39:31.52
He was a 28 star general because when he would put us full uniform on, he had four stars

572
00:39:31.52 --> 00:39:35.52
on this collar on each collar, four star and each shoulder, four stars on the helmet,

573
00:39:35.52 --> 00:39:41.52
and four stars on each one of the handles of his pit of his pearl handled pistol grip.

574
00:39:41.52 --> 00:39:42.52
45.

575
00:39:42.52 --> 00:39:47.52
So the guy was like a little bit of, I mean, that's a, that's a showman.

576
00:39:47.52 --> 00:39:50.52
That's a, that's a, that's a, that's a diva, right?

577
00:39:50.52 --> 00:39:56.52
So he didn't, you know, he knew that there's a certain amount of showmanship to being

578
00:39:56.52 --> 00:39:57.52
at a leadership position.

579
00:39:57.52 --> 00:40:00.52
And that sort of what he's talking about by being recognizable.

580
00:40:00.52 --> 00:40:01.52
I mean, he was a very recognizable.

581
00:40:01.52 --> 00:40:04.52
He had stars all over his cars and everything.

582
00:40:04.52 --> 00:40:05.52
Yeah.

583
00:40:05.52 --> 00:40:07.52
So it's more like the comfort of a battle, so.

584
00:40:07.52 --> 00:40:10.52
Yeah, but you could, you could, as a CEO, you could absolutely take that.

585
00:40:10.52 --> 00:40:15.52
To the wrong level where you're, you know, just living in total luxury, you know,

586
00:40:15.52 --> 00:40:19.52
your people out and, you know, cramped into cubicles that, you know, your,

587
00:40:19.52 --> 00:40:21.52
your folks would definitely look at you in a negative way.

588
00:40:21.52 --> 00:40:22.52
Yeah.

589
00:40:22.52 --> 00:40:26.52
But to, but to have what's needed for the job, you know,

590
00:40:26.52 --> 00:40:30.52
when I was to you commander, I had an office that was mine, you know,

591
00:40:30.52 --> 00:40:32.52
and I had space in there to work.

592
00:40:32.52 --> 00:40:37.52
But I wasn't, you know, shipping in stakes for me to have every night while

593
00:40:37.52 --> 00:40:38.52
the men were eating.

594
00:40:38.52 --> 00:40:40.52
Right. Right.

595
00:40:40.52 --> 00:40:41.52
M-O-E-Z.

596
00:40:41.52 --> 00:40:42.52
Yeah.

597
00:40:42.52 --> 00:40:44.52
So just got to be careful.

598
00:40:44.52 --> 00:40:46.52
Keep yourself in check a little bit.

599
00:40:46.52 --> 00:40:48.52
Well, when you travel, you go first class.

600
00:40:48.52 --> 00:40:50.52
Meanwhile, you send your team in coach.

601
00:40:50.52 --> 00:40:54.52
That, once again, sometimes the boss is traveling for a

602
00:40:54.52 --> 00:40:56.52
class because when he lands, he's got to present.

603
00:40:56.52 --> 00:40:59.52
And he's got to, he's got to be a little bit better rested.

604
00:40:59.52 --> 00:41:03.52
Sometimes the boss man is just sick of being cramped in a little tiny

605
00:41:03.52 --> 00:41:04.52
seats.

606
00:41:04.52 --> 00:41:05.52
Hmm.

607
00:41:05.52 --> 00:41:08.52
Well, yeah, you do got to keep that in check.

608
00:41:08.52 --> 00:41:11.52
And I'll tell you when I, when I worked for the Admiral of all the seals,

609
00:41:11.52 --> 00:41:13.52
we didn't fly first class.

610
00:41:13.52 --> 00:41:14.52
We were in the cheap seats.

611
00:41:14.52 --> 00:41:16.52
They are very careful about that.

612
00:41:16.52 --> 00:41:21.52
They don't want to think that the, oh, the military elite is flying around

613
00:41:21.52 --> 00:41:22.52
first class.

614
00:41:22.52 --> 00:41:26.52
No, we were in the cheap seats sitting in the back of Delta, you know,

615
00:41:26.52 --> 00:41:27.52
you know, you'd be nuts.

616
00:41:27.52 --> 00:41:28.52
Yeah.

617
00:41:30.52 --> 00:41:31.52
Yeah.

618
00:41:31.52 --> 00:41:34.52
There's so many justifiable reasons in business.

619
00:41:34.52 --> 00:41:37.52
And I think you would go along with that too.

620
00:41:37.52 --> 00:41:39.52
But you just got to use your judgment.

621
00:41:39.52 --> 00:41:42.52
You got to use your judgment and make sure that, you know,

622
00:41:42.52 --> 00:41:45.52
everyone's wearing, you know, a ten year old field jacket

623
00:41:45.52 --> 00:41:48.52
when it gets cold and you're wearing a brand new down and

624
00:41:48.52 --> 00:41:50.52
Gore-Tex jacket.

625
00:41:50.52 --> 00:41:52.52
You're people are going to not respect you.

626
00:41:52.52 --> 00:41:53.52
Yeah.

627
00:41:53.52 --> 00:41:56.52
You know, you can't just deck yourself out when the boys,

628
00:41:56.52 --> 00:42:00.52
or the troopers are suffering.

629
00:42:00.52 --> 00:42:01.52
Yeah.

630
00:42:01.52 --> 00:42:02.52
Yeah.

631
00:42:02.52 --> 00:42:07.52
And then how he mentioned where or how you mentioned what he's talking about

632
00:42:07.52 --> 00:42:10.52
where it can be categorized as being recognizable.

633
00:42:10.52 --> 00:42:10.52
Right.

634
00:42:10.52 --> 00:42:14.52
So there's a lot of things even stuff outside of just uniform that a CEO

635
00:42:14.52 --> 00:42:17.52
how he presents himself that'll keep him recognizable.

636
00:42:17.52 --> 00:42:18.52
Yeah.

637
00:42:18.52 --> 00:42:23.52
For all these reasons, but I'm sure I'm sure most of the time no one's perfect

638
00:42:23.52 --> 00:42:26.52
where they're going to start doing it this year.

639
00:42:26.52 --> 00:42:27.52
But you do have to.

640
00:42:27.52 --> 00:42:30.52
And you know, there's good, there's good business leaders now that

641
00:42:30.52 --> 00:42:33.52
follow this type of lead. I mean, look at some of these new younger

642
00:42:33.52 --> 00:42:34.52
businesses.

643
00:42:34.52 --> 00:42:34.52
Yeah.

644
00:42:34.52 --> 00:42:35.52
I get decked out.

645
00:42:35.52 --> 00:42:35.52
Yeah.

646
00:42:35.52 --> 00:42:39.52
So a picture of the guy that runs Facebook as saw pictures

647
00:42:39.52 --> 00:42:42.52
caused the other days got like a bunch of gray t-shirts in there.

648
00:42:42.52 --> 00:42:42.52
Right.

649
00:42:42.52 --> 00:42:46.52
And from what I hear, I'm like, been to the office and nothing.

650
00:42:46.52 --> 00:42:48.52
He, he doesn't have an office.

651
00:42:48.52 --> 00:42:50.52
He, there's this open space, everyone's coding and

652
00:42:50.52 --> 00:42:51.52
something like that.

653
00:42:51.52 --> 00:42:53.52
And he's just cruising in there as well.

654
00:42:53.52 --> 00:42:54.52
Yeah.

655
00:42:54.52 --> 00:42:56.52
So yeah, there's, yeah, I guess this all kinds of

656
00:42:56.52 --> 00:42:58.52
people are late to have a bit more.

657
00:42:58.52 --> 00:42:59.52
Yeah.

658
00:42:59.52 --> 00:43:00.52
Yeah.

659
00:43:00.52 --> 00:43:01.52
I guess they've depend on the businesses.

660
00:43:01.52 --> 00:43:03.52
Yeah.

661
00:43:03.52 --> 00:43:07.52
However, this part is undivatable.

662
00:43:07.52 --> 00:43:13.52
A general officer who will invariably assume the responsibility for failure

663
00:43:13.52 --> 00:43:18.52
whether he deserves it or not and invariably gives credit for success

664
00:43:18.52 --> 00:43:23.52
to others whether they deserve it or not will achieve outstanding success.

665
00:43:23.52 --> 00:43:26.52
So a little something that we call extreme ownership.

666
00:43:26.52 --> 00:43:29.52
So that's the name of our book, someone that's taking ownership.

667
00:43:29.52 --> 00:43:30.52
This Georgia is patting.

668
00:43:30.52 --> 00:43:32.52
Sorry for jacking your ideas, Georgia.

669
00:43:32.52 --> 00:43:33.52
Yeah.

670
00:43:33.52 --> 00:43:38.52
I think that's crazy how that was such a prominent idea back then.

671
00:43:38.52 --> 00:43:39.52
Yeah.

672
00:43:39.52 --> 00:43:43.52
Because like growing up and I don't know, I just never heard about that.

673
00:43:43.52 --> 00:43:44.52
I know.

674
00:43:44.52 --> 00:43:49.52
And when LaFanite presented this book to people, they don't say, oh,

675
00:43:49.52 --> 00:43:52.52
this is a very common theme that I've heard my whole life know they go.

676
00:43:52.52 --> 00:43:53.52
This is outstanding.

677
00:43:53.52 --> 00:44:03.52
We're saying the exact same thing the general Georgia's patent saying right here, which is obviously extremely important.

678
00:44:03.52 --> 00:44:05.52
Issuing orders.

679
00:44:05.52 --> 00:44:12.52
The best way to issue orders is by word of mouth from one general to the next, failing this telephone

680
00:44:12.52 --> 00:44:15.52
conversations which should be recorded at each end.

681
00:44:15.52 --> 00:44:22.52
However, in order to have a confirmatory memorandum of all orders given a short written order

682
00:44:22.52 --> 00:44:29.52
should always be made out, not necessarily at the time of issuing the order, but it should reach the junior prior to carrying out the order.

683
00:44:29.52 --> 00:44:36.52
So that if he has forgotten anything, he will be reminded of it and further in order that he may be aware that his senior has taken

684
00:44:36.52 --> 00:44:39.52
definite responsibility for the operation ordered or late.

685
00:44:39.52 --> 00:44:42.52
This is something that I used to do this all the time.

686
00:44:42.52 --> 00:44:45.52
If I had a conversation with my boss, I still do it to this day.

687
00:44:45.52 --> 00:44:50.52
If I have a conversation with someone and we talk about something, I'm following it up a little email.

688
00:44:50.52 --> 00:44:55.52
Because also oral conversations, people hear what they want to hear.

689
00:44:55.52 --> 00:44:58.52
And they might hear two different things.

690
00:44:58.52 --> 00:45:01.52
If I tell you, hey, we're going to record this podcast.

691
00:45:01.52 --> 00:45:04.52
Hey, can we record this podcast on Saturday?

692
00:45:04.52 --> 00:45:06.52
You're like, oh, yeah, definitely.

693
00:45:06.52 --> 00:45:07.52
Does that mean we are?

694
00:45:07.52 --> 00:45:10.52
Does that mean in your mind you think we are, but I didn't come back.

695
00:45:10.52 --> 00:45:13.52
You know, so I just follow stuff up and I used to do that in the sealed teams too.

696
00:45:13.52 --> 00:45:16.52
You know, I get an order I'd get a conversation with.

697
00:45:16.52 --> 00:45:22.52
I'm going to know that was either above me or below me or whatever, I'd follow it up with an email of what I thought the conversation meant.

698
00:45:22.52 --> 00:45:25.52
And say, hey, just to confirm what we talked about.

699
00:45:25.52 --> 00:45:26.52
Here's the three bullet points.

700
00:45:26.52 --> 00:45:27.52
I'm going to do this.

701
00:45:27.52 --> 00:45:28.52
You're going to do that.

702
00:45:28.52 --> 00:45:30.52
We're going to do this and boom, it's done.

703
00:45:30.52 --> 00:45:33.52
And we have a document of it and it exists and that way we're confirmed.

704
00:45:33.52 --> 00:45:40.52
Yeah, and so how you bring up that example, where if you say, hey, can we record a podcast on Saturday?

705
00:45:40.52 --> 00:45:42.52
Technically, you just, that's a yes or no question.

706
00:45:42.52 --> 00:45:43.52
Yes, we can.

707
00:45:43.52 --> 00:45:46.52
We have that ability.

708
00:45:46.52 --> 00:45:48.52
That's not you didn't schedule anything, technically.

709
00:45:48.52 --> 00:45:51.52
You said, so I could have taken it either way.

710
00:45:51.52 --> 00:45:53.52
And you could be like, yeah, we can.

711
00:45:53.52 --> 00:45:56.52
And I show up here today and you're, oh, yeah, I didn't know we're actually going to do it.

712
00:45:56.52 --> 00:46:01.52
You just said, you know, when I first started getting more higher in clients,

713
00:46:01.52 --> 00:46:04.52
it was immediately noticeable that that was a common thing.

714
00:46:04.52 --> 00:46:07.52
They'd always follow up with an email right after.

715
00:46:07.52 --> 00:46:08.52
Help so much, man.

716
00:46:08.52 --> 00:46:09.52
It does.

717
00:46:09.52 --> 00:46:10.52
You got to do it.

718
00:46:10.52 --> 00:46:12.52
It is my, this, I love this.

719
00:46:12.52 --> 00:46:17.52
It is my opinion that Army orders should not exceed a page and a half of type written text.

720
00:46:17.52 --> 00:46:21.52
And it was my practice not to issue orders longer than this.

721
00:46:21.52 --> 00:46:26.52
Usually they can be done on one page and the back of the page is used for a sketch map.

722
00:46:26.52 --> 00:46:29.52
And what my favorite part about this is,

723
00:46:29.52 --> 00:46:32.52
if you get someone that can't give you their orders,

724
00:46:32.52 --> 00:46:34.52
they're in like a page, yeah,

725
00:46:34.52 --> 00:46:37.52
then that means their orders are too complicated.

726
00:46:37.52 --> 00:46:40.52
Yeah, if they means they need to simplify their plan.

727
00:46:40.52 --> 00:46:44.52
And he's going to say this a few times.

728
00:46:44.52 --> 00:46:53.52
Commanders must remember that the issuance of an order or the devising of a plan is only about five percent of the responsibility of command.

729
00:46:53.52 --> 00:46:59.52
The other 95 percent is to ensure by personal observation or through

730
00:46:59.52 --> 00:47:02.52
interposing of staff officers that the order is carried out.

731
00:47:02.52 --> 00:47:06.52
Or there must be issued early enough to permit time disseminate them.

732
00:47:06.52 --> 00:47:10.52
So he's saying like, it's only five percent of your job to come up with a plan and disseminate the plan.

733
00:47:10.52 --> 00:47:13.52
The other 95 percent of your job is to make sure it happens.

734
00:47:13.52 --> 00:47:17.52
Take an ownership of the plan and get it implemented.

735
00:47:17.52 --> 00:47:21.52
And this is the most important part of this section.

736
00:47:21.52 --> 00:47:27.52
Never tell people how to do things, tell them what and they tell them what to do,

737
00:47:27.52 --> 00:47:30.52
and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.

738
00:47:30.52 --> 00:47:35.52
So you want to give them sort of the broad,

739
00:47:35.52 --> 00:47:39.52
hey, this is what I want you to get done and let them figure out how to do it.

740
00:47:39.52 --> 00:47:42.52
You're not going to be able to tell everybody on your team.

741
00:47:42.52 --> 00:47:44.52
What to do and do it and all that.

742
00:47:44.52 --> 00:47:46.52
You've got to let them run.

743
00:47:46.52 --> 00:47:47.52
Yeah.

744
00:47:47.52 --> 00:47:50.52
You've got to use the little decentralized command as we like to say.

745
00:47:50.52 --> 00:47:59.52
Yeah, in the creative world, that's a really, really significant thing to say what you want and then let that person do it.

746
00:47:59.52 --> 00:48:01.52
Because if you have some creative vision,

747
00:48:01.52 --> 00:48:06.52
let's do a little critique of Jockel, how do I do with that?

748
00:48:06.52 --> 00:48:09.52
Because you're sort of the creative end here.

749
00:48:09.52 --> 00:48:10.52
Yeah.

750
00:48:10.52 --> 00:48:11.52
And how am I?

751
00:48:11.52 --> 00:48:11.52
Good.

752
00:48:11.52 --> 00:48:12.52
As well.

753
00:48:12.52 --> 00:48:13.52
I do.

754
00:48:13.52 --> 00:48:14.52
I say, you know what echo here is what I think.

755
00:48:14.52 --> 00:48:15.52
Yeah.

756
00:48:15.52 --> 00:48:18.52
And then I just back away and let you run with your game.

757
00:48:18.52 --> 00:48:19.52
Yeah.

758
00:48:19.52 --> 00:48:20.52
And that's the, yeah.

759
00:48:20.52 --> 00:48:21.52
That's the way it goes.

760
00:48:21.52 --> 00:48:21.52
I don't know.

761
00:48:21.52 --> 00:48:24.52
I'm sure it's equally as applicable everywhere.

762
00:48:24.52 --> 00:48:24.52
Yeah.

763
00:48:24.52 --> 00:48:27.52
I realize that I can't.

764
00:48:27.52 --> 00:48:29.52
When you've got an expert, you know,

765
00:48:29.52 --> 00:48:33.52
it's the same thing or it was in the teams, the same thing in the business world.

766
00:48:33.52 --> 00:48:40.52
If you're the big boss man, you shouldn't, you're not going to know how to do all the technical things at the folks on the front line.

767
00:48:40.52 --> 00:48:44.52
You're not going to have the creativity because you have the capability because you've got other things you should be worried about.

768
00:48:44.52 --> 00:48:45.52
Yeah.

769
00:48:45.52 --> 00:48:47.52
So get on those other things and let your people run.

770
00:48:47.52 --> 00:48:48.52
Yeah.

771
00:48:48.52 --> 00:48:50.52
Let them run.

772
00:48:50.52 --> 00:48:52.52
And this,

773
00:48:52.52 --> 00:48:56.52
it is sad to remember that when anyone has fairly mastered the art of command,

774
00:48:56.52 --> 00:49:04.52
the necessity for that art usually expires either through the termination of the war or through the advanced age of the commander.

775
00:49:04.52 --> 00:49:07.52
And this is just a, this is just a damn shame.

776
00:49:07.52 --> 00:49:08.52
And it's the way it is.

777
00:49:08.52 --> 00:49:11.52
And it's, it's just, it's just way in the military.

778
00:49:11.52 --> 00:49:17.52
You're, the, when you start feeling like you've really gotten good at that job, you're onto your next job.

779
00:49:17.52 --> 00:49:18.52
Mm-hmm.

780
00:49:18.52 --> 00:49:21.52
And that doesn't feel good.

781
00:49:21.52 --> 00:49:23.52
It's, it's a, it's a bummer.

782
00:49:23.52 --> 00:49:24.52
Um.

783
00:49:24.52 --> 00:49:28.52
And then there was a little.

784
00:49:28.52 --> 00:49:32.52
Example when I talked about him being ultra aggressive.

785
00:49:32.52 --> 00:49:34.52
And this is from a section.

786
00:49:34.52 --> 00:49:35.52
This is from a section which I didn't take.

787
00:49:35.52 --> 00:49:37.52
I don't think I took much out of it all.

788
00:49:37.52 --> 00:49:39.52
This one's called or this section was called or ring my pay.

789
00:49:39.52 --> 00:49:41.52
He talks about these important decisions that he made.

790
00:49:41.52 --> 00:49:44.52
But they're, they're, they take, they're a little bit complex.

791
00:49:44.52 --> 00:49:45.52
Some of them.

792
00:49:45.52 --> 00:49:49.52
But this one was fairly concise about the fifth of September.

793
00:49:49.52 --> 00:49:51.52
It became apparent that we would run out of gasoline.

794
00:49:51.52 --> 00:49:53.52
He's talking about for his tanks.

795
00:49:53.52 --> 00:49:55.52
We would run out of gasoline.

796
00:49:55.52 --> 00:50:03.52
I directed the two core to continue the advance until the tanks ran out of gas and then to go on on foot.

797
00:50:03.52 --> 00:50:09.52
This was actually done and the bridge head across the Mazzel River was secured as a result.

798
00:50:09.52 --> 00:50:14.52
There was considerable resistance on the part of the core commanders to do what appeared to them.

799
00:50:14.52 --> 00:50:17.52
And unnecessarily gained your operation.

800
00:50:17.52 --> 00:50:21.52
It's success again proved that it was not dangerous.

801
00:50:21.52 --> 00:50:24.52
So that's pretty aggressive.

802
00:50:24.52 --> 00:50:27.52
Hey, you drive until the tanks run out of gas and the tanks run out of gas.

803
00:50:27.52 --> 00:50:29.52
Get out of the tanks and walk.

804
00:50:29.52 --> 00:50:30.52
Yeah.

805
00:50:30.52 --> 00:50:32.52
That's pretty legit.

806
00:50:32.52 --> 00:50:36.52
We used to say like, hey, in the sealed teams, hey, we're going to take the boats.

807
00:50:36.52 --> 00:50:39.52
The boats run out of gas.

808
00:50:39.52 --> 00:50:41.52
We'll tow the boats.

809
00:50:41.52 --> 00:50:44.52
If the tow and boats run out of gas, we'll get out and swim.

810
00:50:44.52 --> 00:50:47.52
We'll keep going until we get it done.

811
00:50:47.52 --> 00:50:50.52
Letter of instruction number two.

812
00:50:50.52 --> 00:50:54.52
So these are what these are what this guy and I love this.

813
00:50:54.52 --> 00:51:00.52
This is what this guy was writing as instructions to be handed out to all of his men.

814
00:51:00.52 --> 00:51:03.52
I mean, and this is documented.

815
00:51:03.52 --> 00:51:05.52
So you wonder what patent thinks about you have to wonder.

816
00:51:05.52 --> 00:51:07.52
It's right here.

817
00:51:07.52 --> 00:51:12.52
So here's his letter of instruction number two.

818
00:51:12.52 --> 00:51:14.52
Discipline.

819
00:51:14.52 --> 00:51:16.52
There is only one sort of discipline.

820
00:51:16.52 --> 00:51:18.52
Perfect discipline.

821
00:51:18.52 --> 00:51:22.52
Men cannot have good battle discipline and poor administrative discipline.

822
00:51:22.52 --> 00:51:28.52
Discipline is based on pride in the profession of arms, on meticulous attention to detail,

823
00:51:28.52 --> 00:51:31.52
and on mutual respect and confidence.

824
00:51:31.52 --> 00:51:38.52
Discipline must be a habit so ingrained that it is stronger than the excitement of battle or the fear of death.

825
00:51:38.52 --> 00:51:45.52
And this is why it's every day and every decision that you make and keeping that discipline.

826
00:51:45.52 --> 00:51:51.52
And I actually have been here and you know, here that this, this, that you will power deteriorates.

827
00:51:51.52 --> 00:51:53.52
And I actually don't believe that.

828
00:51:53.52 --> 00:51:59.52
I think the more they say, oh, you know, throughout the day you will power if you test it too many times.

829
00:51:59.52 --> 00:52:01.52
It gets weaker and weaker and I actually don't believe that.

830
00:52:01.52 --> 00:52:02.52
I actually believe it gets stronger.

831
00:52:02.52 --> 00:52:04.52
Mind gets stronger.

832
00:52:04.52 --> 00:52:10.52
When I'm, the more I hold the line, the stronger the hold is, the better the grip is.

833
00:52:10.52 --> 00:52:12.52
And that's the day by day.

834
00:52:12.52 --> 00:52:16.52
And normally like it's all together.

835
00:52:16.52 --> 00:52:17.52
It's all good together.

836
00:52:17.52 --> 00:52:20.52
When you wake up early and you get your workout in,

837
00:52:20.52 --> 00:52:22.52
you just stay on track.

838
00:52:22.52 --> 00:52:23.52
You're like, you know what?

839
00:52:23.52 --> 00:52:25.52
I'm not going to eat that food that I don't need right now.

840
00:52:25.52 --> 00:52:27.52
You know, it's so much easier.

841
00:52:27.52 --> 00:52:29.52
But the day when you're like, I didn't work.

842
00:52:29.52 --> 00:52:32.52
I woke up late and I didn't get my workout done.

843
00:52:32.52 --> 00:52:33.52
And you know what?

844
00:52:33.52 --> 00:52:34.52
There's a donut.

845
00:52:34.52 --> 00:52:36.52
You know, and it'd be you break down.

846
00:52:36.52 --> 00:52:40.52
So you want to, you want to use the discipline discipline and forces discipline.

847
00:52:40.52 --> 00:52:41.52
Yeah.

848
00:52:41.52 --> 00:52:43.52
Discipline more discipline makes more discipline.

849
00:52:43.52 --> 00:52:44.52
Yeah.

850
00:52:44.52 --> 00:52:48.52
It kind of seems like that it would be just like any other exercise.

851
00:52:48.52 --> 00:52:49.52
Yeah.

852
00:52:49.52 --> 00:52:50.52
Exercising your discipline.

853
00:52:50.52 --> 00:52:54.52
So, and maybe I don't know, but maybe this is what that means when they say eight.

854
00:52:54.52 --> 00:52:57.52
You're, you're, will power wears down.

855
00:52:57.52 --> 00:53:00.52
Let's say you're trying to stick to this diet, right?

856
00:53:00.52 --> 00:53:03.52
And you're going to be like, hey, I'm not going to let myself get too hungry.

857
00:53:03.52 --> 00:53:09.52
Because when I let myself get too hungry, I know that don't not seem way more viable.

858
00:53:09.52 --> 00:53:12.52
The donuts are not viable.

859
00:53:12.52 --> 00:53:18.52
But, you know, as far as the pay off, you know, debtor, it, you know, it's like basically,

860
00:53:18.52 --> 00:53:24.52
so if I test my willpower, I'm just saying throughout the span of a day or, you know, however many hours when you start to get hungry.

861
00:53:24.52 --> 00:53:29.52
So, they're saying, okay, so let's say you take your hunger to a certain point then you say, you know what?

862
00:53:29.52 --> 00:53:31.52
I'm going to stick to stay strong.

863
00:53:31.52 --> 00:53:34.52
Usually I eat way before this, but I'm real hungry.

864
00:53:34.52 --> 00:53:36.52
I really want those donuts, but you know what?

865
00:53:36.52 --> 00:53:44.52
I'm going to stick with it, right? And you have that one experience of taking your hunger to a certain point and still sticking to it.

866
00:53:44.52 --> 00:53:48.52
You do that. You let your hunger go on for even more.

867
00:53:48.52 --> 00:53:50.52
That's your willpower wearing down wearing down.

868
00:53:50.52 --> 00:53:58.52
But, let's say you stuck to it, boom, and you stuck to it that day, then the next day, you have experience going that far and your hunger.

869
00:53:58.52 --> 00:54:01.52
And you will be stronger and know how to deal with it.

870
00:54:01.52 --> 00:54:03.52
I actually, I also disagree with you.

871
00:54:03.52 --> 00:54:10.52
I think that when you stay strong, you get stronger and when you break, like I don't often just happen, all just have one bite of that donut.

872
00:54:10.52 --> 00:54:15.52
For me, every single time, and then you have that one bite of what happens, that donut scoop.

873
00:54:15.52 --> 00:54:18.52
Yeah, every single one bite, ten bites, so that's what I'm saying.

874
00:54:18.52 --> 00:54:20.52
Stay strong. Hold your discipline in place.

875
00:54:20.52 --> 00:54:29.52
Yeah, so to compare that to like a workout, right? So let's say I do a hard set of, I don't know, pushups.

876
00:54:29.52 --> 00:54:35.52
Then I do another hard set of pushups. I'm going to be less strong on that second set.

877
00:54:35.52 --> 00:54:38.52
And I do another set. I keep testing it.

878
00:54:38.52 --> 00:54:43.52
But the next day or the next week, I'm going to have benefits from that workout.

879
00:54:43.52 --> 00:54:46.52
Yeah, so it does reinforce.

880
00:54:46.52 --> 00:54:51.52
So the workout, the fatigue is that temporary fatigue, then you recover from it and then your stronger and the weight.

881
00:54:51.52 --> 00:54:58.52
But I think the better example is, like, when you say no to the one bite, you are, it's easier to say no to the whole donut.

882
00:54:58.52 --> 00:55:02.52
Yeah, when you say yes to the one bite, it's easier to say yes to the whole donut.

883
00:55:02.52 --> 00:55:05.52
So say no to the one bite.

884
00:55:05.52 --> 00:55:07.52
Yeah, keep your discipline intact.

885
00:55:07.52 --> 00:55:08.52
Yeah, man.

886
00:55:08.52 --> 00:55:10.52
Discipline back to the book.

887
00:55:10.52 --> 00:55:21.52
Discipline can only be obtained when officers are so imbued with the sense of their awful obligation to their men and to their country that they cannot tolerate negligence.

888
00:55:21.52 --> 00:55:30.52
Officers who fail to correct errors or to praise excellent are valueless and peace and dangerous misfits in war.

889
00:55:30.52 --> 00:55:37.52
So he's giving equal equal importance to correcting errors and praising excellence.

890
00:55:37.52 --> 00:55:39.52
You can see how important that is.

891
00:55:39.52 --> 00:55:43.52
And that's something that I've never been very good at. I was never a big praiser of excellence.

892
00:55:43.52 --> 00:55:48.52
And in reading this, I look back and say, I should have done that more.

893
00:55:48.52 --> 00:55:59.52
Officers must assert themselves by example and by voice, they must be preeminent, encouraged, deportment and dress.

894
00:55:59.52 --> 00:56:14.52
One of the primary purposes of discipline is to produce alertness, a man who is so a phargeic that he fails to salute will fall in easy victim to the enemy.

895
00:56:14.52 --> 00:56:30.52
So the discipline just keeps you on track combat experiences proven that ceremonies such as formal guard mounts, formal retreat formations and regular and supervised revelations are a great help and in some cases essential to prepare men and officers for battle.

896
00:56:30.52 --> 00:56:38.52
To give them that perfect discipline, that smartness of appearance, that alertness without which battles cannot be won.

897
00:56:38.52 --> 00:56:53.52
And this is something, you know, the seal teams for sure are very undisciplined when it comes to uniforms when it comes to march.

898
00:56:53.52 --> 00:57:03.52
I mean, we don't march. I mean, we barely can get in. Whenever a bunch of seals have to do something militaristic, it's usually a pretty we have to dumb it down and make it as easy as possible.

899
00:57:03.52 --> 00:57:16.52
Because we just don't do it enough. And that's just, I'm just, I'm kind of stating that because we spend all of our time, you know, when we're, when we're practicing for war, we're not doing anything ceremonial.

900
00:57:16.52 --> 00:57:28.52
We practice for war. So this is kind of a funny little dichotomy there is that seals generally are not ready for military inspection, but they're ready for combat.

901
00:57:28.52 --> 00:57:47.52
So there's a little, little hypocritical item about that combat principles. Number one, there is no approved solution to any tactical situation.

902
00:57:47.52 --> 00:57:53.52
Little theme of creativity coming back again. There's no approved solution you got to figure it out.

903
00:57:53.52 --> 00:58:12.52
There's only one tactical principle which is not subject to change. It is to use the means at hand to inflict the maximum amount of wounds, death and destruction on the enemy in the minimum amount of time.

904
00:58:12.52 --> 00:58:22.52
That's a pretty simple and straightforward principle. And according to general patent, it does not change.

905
00:58:22.52 --> 00:58:26.52
Battles are won by frightening the enemy.

906
00:58:26.52 --> 00:58:33.52
Fear is induced by inflicting death and wounds on him. Death and wounds are produced by fire.

907
00:58:33.52 --> 00:58:39.52
Fire from the rear is more deadly and three times more effective than that from the front.

908
00:58:39.52 --> 00:58:47.52
But to get fire behind the enemy, you must hold him by frontal fire and move rapidly around his flank.

909
00:58:47.52 --> 00:58:58.52
Frontal attacks against prepared positions should be avoided if possible. I told you he's going to talk about flanks. He's talking about flanks.

910
00:58:58.52 --> 00:59:07.52
Catch the enemy by the nose with fire and kick him in the pants with fire and place through movement. That's flanks.

911
00:59:07.52 --> 00:59:18.52
You can get too strong. Get every man and gun you can secure. Provided is not unduly delay your attack.

912
00:59:18.52 --> 00:59:26.52
We bring on a mission and I'd get some kind of restriction like, hey, we only want you to bring this many guys and I'd say, well, this is in soccer.

913
00:59:26.52 --> 00:59:34.52
We're only allowed to bring 11 per side. Why would I not bring 38 if I can bring 38? Why would I stop myself at 287?

914
00:59:34.52 --> 00:59:38.52
You know, bring as many people as you can. Let's go. Let's rock and roll.

915
00:59:38.52 --> 00:59:48.52
The larger force and the more violence you use in the attack, whether it be men, tanks or ammunition, the smaller will be your proportional losses.

916
00:59:48.52 --> 00:59:54.52
Violence of action is what we used to call that in the sealed teams. Violence of action.

917
00:59:54.52 --> 01:00:04.52
Never yield ground. It is cheaper to hold what you have than to retake what you have lost.

918
01:00:04.52 --> 01:00:15.52
Never permit a unit to dig in until the final objective is reached. Then dig wire and mine. So you can't rest until you get too good spot.

919
01:00:15.52 --> 01:00:25.52
This is the little statement I do in the audience. It's coaching because people, they get in a position and they rest before it's time to rest.

920
01:00:25.52 --> 01:00:35.52
You've got to get the guard back. If someone pass your guard, you don't settle there on your back and let them settle in and start to smash you.

921
01:00:35.52 --> 01:00:41.52
As soon as someone passes your guard, you're recovering. You don't settle down until you're back to a good position.

922
01:00:41.52 --> 01:00:45.52
I can never do that. I noticed that and I actually brought it up to you.

923
01:00:45.52 --> 01:00:55.52
Last week or whatever, when we were old, I was like, there's something that I noticed about you that and that was that in the scramble.

924
01:00:55.52 --> 01:01:01.52
You won't just settle and hang out in my guard. You don't even accept the guard.

925
01:01:01.52 --> 01:01:14.52
Talks about it a long time ago before, but it was a free for whatever reason. Just really prevalent that day. In the scramble, scramble goes on for, let's say, a longer time. Let's say the scramble goes on for six seconds.

926
01:01:14.52 --> 01:01:22.52
Pretty long scramble. It seems like you still wouldn't. You wouldn't even stop the scramble until you're beyond the guard.

927
01:01:22.52 --> 01:01:32.52
You won't just hang out when me. I thought, right in that guard. Give my rest on. But it's surprisingly painfully effective.

928
01:01:32.52 --> 01:01:46.52
Yeah. I was talking to Dean about that yesterday. If Dean isn't a mindset where he's accepting a guard pass or he's accepting, it becomes a much, much easier game.

929
01:01:46.52 --> 01:01:52.52
When he decides he's not going to let you settle until he gets to the advantage of position, it's a nightmare.

930
01:01:52.52 --> 01:01:56.52
Yeah. Because he won't stop moving and he's a good scramble. Yeah. Yeah.

931
01:01:56.52 --> 01:02:04.52
You know what's interesting about these, I have a note in here that, you know, he said, never yield ground never permitted units dig in. He says never.

932
01:02:04.52 --> 01:02:14.52
And that's something that I don't own say, right? Because it takes away the fact that of what he said earlier about there's no written rule. There's no proved method.

933
01:02:14.52 --> 01:02:18.52
You shouldn't use that word never because sometimes you should yield ground.

934
01:02:18.52 --> 01:02:26.52
Right. And sometimes you should dig in even when the final objective is so I know he's just being extreme, but it is I did make a note of that to point out.

935
01:02:26.52 --> 01:02:28.52
General training back to the book.

936
01:02:28.52 --> 01:02:40.52
More emphasis will be placed on the hardening of men and officers. All soldiers and officers should be able to run a mile with combat pack in 10 minutes and March 8 miles and two hours.

937
01:02:40.52 --> 01:02:54.52
The hardening of men and officers. He goes on to say, sharpen axes, pick axes and shovels now and keep them sharp.

938
01:02:54.52 --> 01:03:00.52
That's just an attitude, right? Look, the pick axe that you're going to use to dig in, make it sharp.

939
01:03:00.52 --> 01:03:06.52
In case you get a hack somebody's brain out. Keep it sharp. Yeah.

940
01:03:06.52 --> 01:03:16.52
Battles are fought by platoons and squads. Place emphasis on small unit combat instructions so that it's conducted in the same precision as close to order drill.

941
01:03:16.52 --> 01:03:24.52
A good solution applied with vigor now is better than a perfect solution 10 minutes later. Come and theme.

942
01:03:28.52 --> 01:03:32.52
Needless requirements.

943
01:03:32.52 --> 01:03:40.52
He's actually got a section here called Needless Requirements. There is a tendency and I used to see this in the military and I see it in businesses now.

944
01:03:40.52 --> 01:03:50.52
This is the Needless Requirements. There is a tendency for the chain of command to overload junior officers by excessive requirements in a way of training and reports.

945
01:03:50.52 --> 01:04:04.52
You will alleviate this burden by eliminating non-essential demands. You go to any business and they've got reports that people are generating and meetings that they're attending in conference calls.

946
01:04:04.52 --> 01:04:08.52
That's what this is about. Those are needless requirements.

947
01:04:08.52 --> 01:04:20.52
I think people just like meetings because it helps them think or feel like doing something.

948
01:04:20.52 --> 01:04:24.52
You make meetings 20 minutes long.

949
01:04:24.52 --> 01:04:26.52
Just call on the phone.

950
01:04:26.52 --> 01:04:28.52
Yes.

951
01:04:28.52 --> 01:04:40.52
Make your meetings 20 minutes long. If you have to schedule them show up on the meeting ready to do need to learn anything.

952
01:04:40.52 --> 01:04:42.52
It's for the decision.

953
01:04:42.52 --> 01:04:46.52
You can get informed by reading a quick, bolded list.

954
01:04:46.52 --> 01:04:48.52
Go over those bullets with me when I already did that.

955
01:04:48.52 --> 01:04:52.52
I'm going to ask questions.

956
01:04:52.52 --> 01:05:00.52
Discussion piece.

957
01:05:00.52 --> 01:05:02.52
Let's say there's a meeting of 10 guys.

958
01:05:02.52 --> 01:05:08.52
Three four guys are discussing stuff and maybe they're trying to solve this problem that they specifically have and then the other few guys

959
01:05:08.52 --> 01:05:18.52
They feel compelled to want to be contributing to the meetings so they say more of the stuff that's so unnecessary just so they can have something to say in the meeting.

960
01:05:18.52 --> 01:05:24.52
The sidebar taking somewhere else. You've angered echo people.

961
01:05:24.52 --> 01:05:26.52
The meetings.

962
01:05:26.52 --> 01:05:26.52
Yeah.

963
01:05:26.52 --> 01:05:28.52
Keep in 20 minutes.

964
01:05:28.52 --> 01:05:32.52
There's a whole lot of people in America in business world that are listening to that.

965
01:05:32.52 --> 01:05:34.52
Needless requirements.

966
01:05:34.52 --> 01:05:36.52
And they're thinking about, could needless requirements.

967
01:05:36.52 --> 01:05:38.52
They fulfill in a daily basis.

968
01:05:38.52 --> 01:05:40.52
And it makes the mangreary.

969
01:05:40.52 --> 01:05:42.52
It's a source of frustration.

970
01:05:42.52 --> 01:05:44.52
I talk to folks about it all the time.

971
01:05:44.52 --> 01:05:46.52
They feel like they don't have time to do their job.

972
01:05:46.52 --> 01:05:48.52
I'm like, are you serious?

973
01:05:48.52 --> 01:05:54.52
We have to do fill out this document, attend another call with the so-and-so commander.

974
01:05:54.52 --> 01:05:58.52
Just tell me, give me the highlights and let me do my work.

975
01:05:58.52 --> 01:06:02.52
I got to job the do-vier people.

976
01:06:02.52 --> 01:06:04.52
Infantry.

977
01:06:04.52 --> 01:06:10.52
Infantry must move in order to close with the, in order to close with the enemy.

978
01:06:10.52 --> 01:06:12.52
It must shoot in order to move.

979
01:06:12.52 --> 01:06:14.52
Again, there's covering move.

980
01:06:14.52 --> 01:06:16.52
Infysical targets are not visible.

981
01:06:16.52 --> 01:06:22.52
The fire of all infantry weapons must search the area occupied by the enemy.

982
01:06:22.52 --> 01:06:23.52
Use marching fire.

983
01:06:23.52 --> 01:06:27.52
It reduces the accuracy of his fire and increases our confidence.

984
01:06:27.52 --> 01:06:28.52
Shoot short.

985
01:06:28.52 --> 01:06:32.52
Ricochet's make nasty sounds and wounds.

986
01:06:32.52 --> 01:06:34.52
That's something that they say,

987
01:06:34.52 --> 01:06:36.52
I'll us do all the time and seal teams.

988
01:06:36.52 --> 01:06:38.52
So you don't, you make sure you're shooting low.

989
01:06:38.52 --> 01:06:40.52
If you're going to make a mistake, aim low.

990
01:06:40.52 --> 01:06:42.52
So the rounds hit in front of where the enemy is.

991
01:06:42.52 --> 01:06:45.52
And they ricochet up and they hit in with all kinds of frag and rocks.

992
01:06:45.52 --> 01:06:47.52
And you have a chance of still hitting them.

993
01:06:47.52 --> 01:06:48.52
If you shoot over there, head and it misses them.

994
01:06:48.52 --> 01:06:49.52
Yeah, gotcha.

995
01:06:49.52 --> 01:06:50.52
Interesting.

996
01:06:50.52 --> 01:06:53.52
To halt under fire is folly.

997
01:06:53.52 --> 01:06:56.52
To halt under fire and not fire back is suicide.

998
01:06:56.52 --> 01:06:58.52
And this is what we're just talking about in Gjitsu.

999
01:06:58.52 --> 01:07:01.52
To halt under fire, that's what you're doing.

1000
01:07:01.52 --> 01:07:05.52
When you let me keep scrambling, when you stop scrambling,

1001
01:07:05.52 --> 01:07:08.52
that's what I'm going to get a little bit of a fight.

1002
01:07:08.52 --> 01:07:10.52
You're halt to go under fire and guess what?

1003
01:07:10.52 --> 01:07:13.52
It says here that that is suicide.

1004
01:07:13.52 --> 01:07:16.52
Move forward out of fire.

1005
01:07:16.52 --> 01:07:19.52
Officers must set the example.

1006
01:07:19.52 --> 01:07:23.52
Few men are killed by the bayonet.

1007
01:07:23.52 --> 01:07:25.52
Many are scared by it.

1008
01:07:25.52 --> 01:07:28.52
Bayonet should be fixed when the firefight starts.

1009
01:07:28.52 --> 01:07:33.52
Bayonet must be sharpened by the individual soldier.

1010
01:07:33.52 --> 01:07:38.52
The German hates the bayonet and is inferior to our men with it.

1011
01:07:38.52 --> 01:07:40.52
Our men should know this.

1012
01:07:40.52 --> 01:07:42.52
A little psychological warfare here.

1013
01:07:42.52 --> 01:07:44.52
You've got to sharpen your own bayonet.

1014
01:07:44.52 --> 01:07:46.52
You're better at it than the enemy.

1015
01:07:46.52 --> 01:07:51.52
Put that thing on the end of your gun when the firefight starts and get ready to get some.

1016
01:07:51.52 --> 01:07:53.52
Yeah.

1017
01:07:53.52 --> 01:07:55.52
That's general pattern right there.

1018
01:07:55.52 --> 01:07:57.52
Keeping it real.

1019
01:07:57.52 --> 01:08:00.52
I want to work for general pattern.

1020
01:08:00.52 --> 01:08:01.52
Hmm.

1021
01:08:01.52 --> 01:08:03.52
Care of men.

1022
01:08:03.52 --> 01:08:07.52
Officers are responsible, not only for the conduct of their men in battle,

1023
01:08:07.52 --> 01:08:10.52
but also for their health and contentment when not fighting.

1024
01:08:10.52 --> 01:08:15.52
An officer and this will be going back to the CEO and how they act.

1025
01:08:15.52 --> 01:08:20.52
An officer must be the last man to take shelter from fire and the first to move forward.

1026
01:08:20.52 --> 01:08:26.52
Similarly, he must be the last man to look after his own comfort at the close of a march.

1027
01:08:26.52 --> 01:08:29.52
He must see that his men are cared for.

1028
01:08:29.52 --> 01:08:35.52
The officer must constantly inrest himself in the rations of the men.

1029
01:08:35.52 --> 01:08:41.52
He should know his men so well that any sign of sickness or nervous strain will be apparent to him.

1030
01:08:41.52 --> 01:08:46.52
And he can take such action as maybe necessary.

1031
01:08:46.52 --> 01:08:51.52
Same thing we were talking about.

1032
01:08:51.52 --> 01:08:56.52
And we're about to wrap this up here with a couple more.

1033
01:08:56.52 --> 01:09:00.52
And I kind of saved the best for last to be quite honest with you.

1034
01:09:00.52 --> 01:09:05.52
Such as this right here, command leadership.

1035
01:09:05.52 --> 01:09:08.52
This is actually another letter of instructions.

1036
01:09:08.52 --> 01:09:12.52
So again, this is just what you want to know what how general pattern fought.

1037
01:09:12.52 --> 01:09:13.52
Here it is.

1038
01:09:13.52 --> 01:09:19.52
His own words on what he wanted his men to know as they prepared for combat.

1039
01:09:19.52 --> 01:09:21.52
Leadership.

1040
01:09:21.52 --> 01:09:23.52
Full duty.

1041
01:09:23.52 --> 01:09:28.52
Each in his appropriate sphere will lead in person.

1042
01:09:28.52 --> 01:09:41.52
Any commander who fails to obtain his objective and who is not dead or severely wounded has not done his full duty.

1043
01:09:41.52 --> 01:09:45.52
Doesn't need to be much clearer than that.

1044
01:09:45.52 --> 01:09:47.52
There's your standard.

1045
01:09:47.52 --> 01:09:56.52
If you're not dead or severely wounded and you haven't achieved your objective, you haven't done your full duty.

1046
01:09:56.52 --> 01:09:58.52
Visits to the front.

1047
01:09:58.52 --> 01:10:02.52
The commanding general is chief of staff should visit the front daily.

1048
01:10:02.52 --> 01:10:06.52
The function of these is to observe not to metal.

1049
01:10:06.52 --> 01:10:13.52
In addition to their own specialty, they must observe and report anything of military importance.

1050
01:10:13.52 --> 01:10:18.52
Remember that praise is more valuable than blame.

1051
01:10:18.52 --> 01:10:22.52
So if you're going to go to the front line troops, don't go there and blame them.

1052
01:10:22.52 --> 01:10:35.52
Remember to that your primary mission as a leader is to see with your own eyes and be seen by your troops while engaged in personal reconnaissance.

1053
01:10:35.52 --> 01:10:36.52
Execution.

1054
01:10:36.52 --> 01:10:42.52
In carrying out a mission, the promigation of the order represents not over 10% of your responsibility.

1055
01:10:42.52 --> 01:10:51.52
The remaining 90% consists in assuring by means of personal supervision on the ground by yourself and your staff.

1056
01:10:51.52 --> 01:10:53.52
Proper and vigorous execution.

1057
01:10:53.52 --> 01:10:55.52
And that's when we already talked about.

1058
01:10:55.52 --> 01:10:57.52
Yeah, you put together the plan.

1059
01:10:57.52 --> 01:10:59.52
Yeah, you disseminated the plan.

1060
01:10:59.52 --> 01:11:00.52
That's great.

1061
01:11:00.52 --> 01:11:04.52
Your job is to make it happen and ensure that it happens.

1062
01:11:04.52 --> 01:11:08.52
Take ownership of it and execute it.

1063
01:11:12.52 --> 01:11:13.52
Plans.

1064
01:11:13.52 --> 01:11:16.52
Plans must be simple and flexible.

1065
01:11:16.52 --> 01:11:28.52
Actually, they are only a form of data plane from which you build as necessity directs or opportunity offers.

1066
01:11:28.52 --> 01:11:37.52
So he's saying that plan is just just something to build off of as as necessity directs or opportunity offers.

1067
01:11:37.52 --> 01:11:41.52
I got asked this the other day at an event.

1068
01:11:41.52 --> 01:11:47.52
So when do you know when it's time to change the plan?

1069
01:11:47.52 --> 01:11:49.52
When necessity directs or opportunity offers.

1070
01:11:49.52 --> 01:11:53.52
That's when you make the change.

1071
01:11:53.52 --> 01:12:01.52
Plans should be made by the people who are going to execute them.

1072
01:12:01.52 --> 01:12:03.52
Formal orders.

1073
01:12:03.52 --> 01:12:09.52
Formal orders will be preceded by letters of instruction and by personal conferences.

1074
01:12:09.52 --> 01:12:20.52
In this way, the whole purpose of the operation will be made clear together with the mission to be accomplished by each major unit.

1075
01:12:20.52 --> 01:12:28.52
So he's saying that the whole purpose of the operation will be made clear.

1076
01:12:28.52 --> 01:12:34.52
So that if during combat, during combat communication breaks down,

1077
01:12:34.52 --> 01:12:42.52
each commander can and must so act as to obtain the general objective.

1078
01:12:42.52 --> 01:12:43.52
There you go.

1079
01:12:43.52 --> 01:12:54.52
So if you understand what the overall broad mission is when we go out to attack in all of a sudden, you're separated from us or you don't can't communicate with us or any more.

1080
01:12:54.52 --> 01:13:01.52
Or something happens and you're making adjustment your plan as long as you know what the broad mission is.

1081
01:13:01.52 --> 01:13:05.52
The whole purpose of the operation which later ended up being called the commanders intent.

1082
01:13:05.52 --> 01:13:09.52
That's what we called it in the modern military.

1083
01:13:09.52 --> 01:13:15.52
If long as you know what the commanders intent is with the intent of the operation, then you can execute on your own.

1084
01:13:15.52 --> 01:13:17.52
You don't need any more direction for me.

1085
01:13:17.52 --> 01:13:18.52
Yeah.

1086
01:13:18.52 --> 01:13:20.52
Go and make it happen.

1087
01:13:20.52 --> 01:13:24.52
Keep your own orders short.

1088
01:13:24.52 --> 01:13:25.52
Get them out in time.

1089
01:13:25.52 --> 01:13:32.52
Issue them personally by voice when you can.

1090
01:13:32.52 --> 01:13:34.52
Keep troops informed.

1091
01:13:34.52 --> 01:13:47.52
Use every means before and after combat to tell the troops what they are doing to go what they are going to do and what they have done.

1092
01:13:47.52 --> 01:13:49.52
Reiterating discipline.

1093
01:13:49.52 --> 01:13:58.52
There's only one kind of discipline, perfect discipline. If you do not enforce and maintain discipline, you are potential mergers.

1094
01:13:58.52 --> 01:14:01.52
You must set the example.

1095
01:14:01.52 --> 01:14:03.52
Condition.

1096
01:14:03.52 --> 01:14:08.52
High physical condition is vital to victory.

1097
01:14:08.52 --> 01:14:12.52
We talked about that and we talked about that all the time.

1098
01:14:12.52 --> 01:14:14.52
Your physical conditioning.

1099
01:14:14.52 --> 01:14:18.52
High physical condition is vital to victory.

1100
01:14:18.52 --> 01:14:24.52
There are more tired core and division commanders than there are tired core and divisions.

1101
01:14:24.52 --> 01:14:28.52
Fatigue makes cowards of us all.

1102
01:14:28.52 --> 01:14:32.52
Men in condition do not tire.

1103
01:14:32.52 --> 01:14:35.52
So you've got to be in shape.

1104
01:14:35.52 --> 01:14:37.52
And here's the clothes.

1105
01:14:37.52 --> 01:14:39.52
This is the last one.

1106
01:14:39.52 --> 01:14:41.52
And it's the shortest one.

1107
01:14:41.52 --> 01:14:47.52
And it's probably the most important one to remember from general patent.

1108
01:14:47.52 --> 01:14:50.52
Courage.

1109
01:14:50.52 --> 01:14:55.52
Do not take counsel of your fears.

1110
01:14:55.52 --> 01:14:58.52
And that's it.

1111
01:14:58.52 --> 01:15:12.52
That's what he had to say about courage to all of his troops as they embarked on this intense combat day after day week after week.

1112
01:15:12.52 --> 01:15:20.52
And you want to know what you do with your fear. Do not take counsel of your fears.

1113
01:15:20.52 --> 01:15:22.52
No vote. They don't get a vote.

1114
01:15:22.52 --> 01:15:25.52
Your fears don't get a vote.

1115
01:15:25.52 --> 01:15:31.52
So next time you feel that fear no matter what it is, it's pretty easy.

1116
01:15:31.52 --> 01:15:35.52
You don't take counsel of it. They get no vote.

1117
01:15:35.52 --> 01:15:39.52
That's general patent.

1118
01:15:39.52 --> 01:15:42.52
Great book. Great leader.

1119
01:15:42.52 --> 01:15:47.52
Lots to learn. Lots to pass on.

1120
01:15:47.52 --> 01:15:51.52
War as I knew it.

1121
01:15:51.52 --> 01:15:53.52
Questions from the interwebs.

1122
01:15:53.52 --> 01:15:55.52
Yeah.

1123
01:15:55.52 --> 01:15:56.52
First question.

1124
01:15:56.52 --> 01:16:01.52
Jocca Willick is BJJ really practical for street defense where there are no rules.

1125
01:16:01.52 --> 01:16:06.52
My understanding is that it doesn't fare well against knives and multiple attackers.

1126
01:16:06.52 --> 01:16:11.52
I think I've got to do something like Krav Maga, Laitai, Boxing.

1127
01:16:11.52 --> 01:16:16.52
So this is a good question.

1128
01:16:16.52 --> 01:16:17.52
Obviously.

1129
01:16:17.52 --> 01:16:19.52
And it's a question that we get a lot.

1130
01:16:19.52 --> 01:16:21.52
I actually did a video.

1131
01:16:21.52 --> 01:16:24.52
We did a video like this and Tim Ferriss put it out.

1132
01:16:24.52 --> 01:16:29.52
So you can look for that if you kind of want to hear another version of this.

1133
01:16:29.52 --> 01:16:33.52
Maybe we could link to it on Jocco podcast.

1134
01:16:33.52 --> 01:16:37.52
I think we can do that. Yeah. Excellent.

1135
01:16:37.52 --> 01:16:39.52
What? Okay. So self defense.

1136
01:16:39.52 --> 01:16:42.52
We're talking about true self defense here.

1137
01:16:42.52 --> 01:16:45.52
First and foremost, most important thing.

1138
01:16:45.52 --> 01:16:48.52
And I actually didn't say this on the last video.

1139
01:16:48.52 --> 01:16:51.52
But I should say it now.

1140
01:16:51.52 --> 01:16:54.52
Is situational awareness.

1141
01:16:54.52 --> 01:16:59.52
And putting yourself in good situations where bad things are not going to happen to you

1142
01:16:59.52 --> 01:17:03.52
and doing that to the best you ability and being aware of your surroundings.

1143
01:17:03.52 --> 01:17:10.52
That's of the very important first step in self defense.

1144
01:17:10.52 --> 01:17:13.52
Second.

1145
01:17:13.52 --> 01:17:16.52
Guns.

1146
01:17:16.52 --> 01:17:24.52
If you are a person that really needs to defend yourself and you live in a horrible area

1147
01:17:24.52 --> 01:17:31.52
and there's violent people around and you might be a small, very small person

1148
01:17:31.52 --> 01:17:38.52
or you might be elderly or you might have some sort of a physical limitation.

1149
01:17:38.52 --> 01:17:44.52
Then how you're going to defend yourself is using guns.

1150
01:17:44.52 --> 01:17:45.52
Using a gun.

1151
01:17:45.52 --> 01:17:51.52
So I mean that's just the way it is.

1152
01:17:51.52 --> 01:17:56.52
Now, okay. So that being said.

1153
01:17:56.52 --> 01:18:00.52
Maybe you can't have a gun. Maybe you don't have a gun.

1154
01:18:00.52 --> 01:18:03.52
And you don't always want to have to pull a gun out.

1155
01:18:03.52 --> 01:18:05.52
Even though a gun is a great deterrent.

1156
01:18:05.52 --> 01:18:07.52
And most people, if they see that you have a gun or not,

1157
01:18:07.52 --> 01:18:09.52
they don't want to fight you anymore.

1158
01:18:09.52 --> 01:18:13.52
But obviously you can't be just yanking a gun out of anything that happens

1159
01:18:13.52 --> 01:18:15.52
and you don't always have them with you.

1160
01:18:15.52 --> 01:18:19.52
For instance, you know, in certain places you're not allowed to have a gun.

1161
01:18:19.52 --> 01:18:23.52
In the water if you're surfing, you're not allowed to have a gun.

1162
01:18:23.52 --> 01:18:26.52
So what do you do?

1163
01:18:26.52 --> 01:18:32.52
How does GG2 stack up against these other martial arts?

1164
01:18:32.52 --> 01:18:37.52
I say that you should learn GG2 first.

1165
01:18:37.52 --> 01:18:42.52
Should be the first martial art that you try and learn to defend yourself.

1166
01:18:42.52 --> 01:18:45.52
And there's a reason for that.

1167
01:18:45.52 --> 01:18:47.52
There's a bunch of reasons for that.

1168
01:18:47.52 --> 01:18:52.52
Number one, it ends sort of a base reason.

1169
01:18:52.52 --> 01:18:56.52
But GG2 is probably the most complex to learn.

1170
01:18:56.52 --> 01:19:02.52
There's the most three-dimensional martial art.

1171
01:19:02.52 --> 01:19:04.52
It's not linear.

1172
01:19:04.52 --> 01:19:05.52
It's very three-dimensional.

1173
01:19:05.52 --> 01:19:07.52
There's a ton to learn.

1174
01:19:07.52 --> 01:19:08.52
It's infinite.

1175
01:19:08.52 --> 01:19:09.52
And what you can learn.

1176
01:19:09.52 --> 01:19:12.52
So you want to get into it early because it's going to take longer to learn.

1177
01:19:12.52 --> 01:19:14.52
But that's actually the second-dairy reason.

1178
01:19:14.52 --> 01:19:26.52
The primary reason to learn GG2 first is because of the nature of self-defense situations.

1179
01:19:26.52 --> 01:19:32.52
So we are born with our primary form of self-defense.

1180
01:19:32.52 --> 01:19:35.52
And we've learned it from a very young age.

1181
01:19:35.52 --> 01:19:42.52
And our primary form of self-defense will keep you safe from most of these situations.

1182
01:19:42.52 --> 01:19:49.52
And that is running and using your legs to run.

1183
01:19:49.52 --> 01:19:54.52
So, and if you think of now think about this, you're kind of chuckling

1184
01:19:54.52 --> 01:19:57.52
because you don't understand the gravity of what I'm saying.

1185
01:19:57.52 --> 01:19:59.52
Because it's very accurate.

1186
01:19:59.52 --> 01:20:01.52
So listen.

1187
01:20:01.52 --> 01:20:03.52
We're talking about self-defense.

1188
01:20:03.52 --> 01:20:04.52
We're talking about offense.

1189
01:20:04.52 --> 01:20:05.52
We're talking about defense.

1190
01:20:05.52 --> 01:20:07.52
How do you stay safe?

1191
01:20:07.52 --> 01:20:16.52
So if I square off with you and I want to fight and punch you run away,

1192
01:20:16.52 --> 01:20:20.52
I'm not holding on to you run away.

1193
01:20:20.52 --> 01:20:26.52
If there's me and three of my friends run away.

1194
01:20:26.52 --> 01:20:37.52
If I have a knife and I'm going to try and stab you run away.

1195
01:20:37.52 --> 01:20:42.52
So all these kind of attacks, they're disconnected attack.

1196
01:20:42.52 --> 01:20:44.52
I'm not holding on to you.

1197
01:20:44.52 --> 01:20:46.52
So run away from me.

1198
01:20:46.52 --> 01:20:47.52
Get out of there.

1199
01:20:47.52 --> 01:20:49.52
Run into a public place.

1200
01:20:49.52 --> 01:20:52.52
Run to where there's other people that can help you.

1201
01:20:52.52 --> 01:20:54.52
Run.

1202
01:20:54.52 --> 01:21:01.52
Where this changes is when somebody grabs a hold of you.

1203
01:21:01.52 --> 01:21:07.52
When somebody grabs a hold of you, you can no longer run away.

1204
01:21:07.52 --> 01:21:12.52
And you have to be able to make them un-grab you.

1205
01:21:12.52 --> 01:21:14.52
Let go of you.

1206
01:21:14.52 --> 01:21:16.52
And how do you do that?

1207
01:21:16.52 --> 01:21:19.52
You do that by knowing how to grapple.

1208
01:21:19.52 --> 01:21:22.52
And grapple is you, just you.

1209
01:21:22.52 --> 01:21:28.52
So that is why the first thing you should learn is you get to.

1210
01:21:28.52 --> 01:21:34.52
Because if someone's not grabbing a hold of you, run away from them.

1211
01:21:34.52 --> 01:21:41.52
If someone's trying to square off and go toe to toe with you, run away from them.

1212
01:21:41.52 --> 01:21:46.52
If there's five guys that want to fight you, run away from them.

1213
01:21:46.52 --> 01:21:49.52
If someone pulls out a knife on you, run.

1214
01:21:49.52 --> 01:21:51.52
But here's the deal.

1215
01:21:51.52 --> 01:21:56.52
If that person knocks you down and gets on top of you, you can't run anymore.

1216
01:21:56.52 --> 01:21:58.52
So what do you have to do?

1217
01:21:58.52 --> 01:22:05.52
You have to grapple them and you have to know your jitsu to get them up and offer you and get away from them

1218
01:22:05.52 --> 01:22:09.52
or submit them and put them to sleep or break their arm.

1219
01:22:09.52 --> 01:22:13.52
That is why you should start with your jitsu.

1220
01:22:13.52 --> 01:22:15.52
Pretty straightforward.

1221
01:22:15.52 --> 01:22:22.52
Once you know jitsu, absolutely. Learn moi tie. Learn wrestling.

1222
01:22:22.52 --> 01:22:27.52
Learn boxing. Learn krav maga. Learn a screamin.

1223
01:22:27.52 --> 01:22:29.52
It learn everything you can about fighting.

1224
01:22:29.52 --> 01:22:31.52
Do it, of course.

1225
01:22:31.52 --> 01:22:37.52
But set your base with the one that you're going to need if somebody grabs you.

1226
01:22:37.52 --> 01:22:42.52
And that's jiu jitsu.

1227
01:22:42.52 --> 01:22:47.52
The other thing about jiu jitsu is it's pretty easy to add in.

1228
01:22:47.52 --> 01:22:54.52
Some of these other more animalistic self-defense situations.

1229
01:22:54.52 --> 01:22:59.52
So if somebody grabs you and pulls you to the ground and you want to get away from them,

1230
01:22:59.52 --> 01:23:04.52
yeah, you can, you need to know your body positions, but it's pretty easy to decide you're going to bite their ear off

1231
01:23:04.52 --> 01:23:09.52
or take a big chunk out of their face with your teeth or jam your fingers into their eyes.

1232
01:23:09.52 --> 01:23:13.52
It's not hard to augment that stuff.

1233
01:23:13.52 --> 01:23:23.52
So these are all things you can do within jiu jitsu that jiu jitsu does not hamper that ability to be savage in your attacks on people.

1234
01:23:23.52 --> 01:23:30.52
Yeah, and that's interesting you bring up because everyone's heard the guy,

1235
01:23:30.52 --> 01:23:32.52
we're he'll be like, hey, what's that jiu jitsu?

1236
01:23:32.52 --> 01:23:35.52
Whatever. And then, I don't know, you show them or you explain it.

1237
01:23:35.52 --> 01:23:39.52
And they'll be like, oh, well, I'll just, I'll just gouge your eyes out right here.

1238
01:23:39.52 --> 01:23:45.52
Or I just, you know, I don't know, strike your throat or something like this, right?

1239
01:23:45.52 --> 01:23:48.52
So take the eye gouging option.

1240
01:23:48.52 --> 01:23:51.52
You don't have to be trained to eye gouging.

1241
01:23:51.52 --> 01:23:53.52
So we both, well, eye gouging.

1242
01:23:53.52 --> 01:23:56.52
Like if you, if we're going to go eye gouging.

1243
01:23:56.52 --> 01:23:58.52
Yeah, I've had people try to eye gouging before.

1244
01:23:58.52 --> 01:24:00.52
It's not going to stop me.

1245
01:24:00.52 --> 01:24:02.52
And that's a second point.

1246
01:24:02.52 --> 01:24:05.52
It's a serious brother. We were after like metamorphor, we're talking.

1247
01:24:05.52 --> 01:24:08.52
And he, he, he basically did that. He was asking questions.

1248
01:24:08.52 --> 01:24:11.52
He'd be like, no, he get, I won't. I don't have to learn jiu jitsu.

1249
01:24:11.52 --> 01:24:15.52
I would just do this and he'd like, it's like, I know like pressure points.

1250
01:24:15.52 --> 01:24:16.52
That subdued people.

1251
01:24:16.52 --> 01:24:17.52
And I was like, yeah, okay.

1252
01:24:17.52 --> 01:24:19.52
So I said, okay, the Darth Vader.

1253
01:24:19.52 --> 01:24:23.52
Yeah, exactly. So I was like, okay, well, what's the pressure point though?

1254
01:24:23.52 --> 01:24:25.52
So I was like, okay, do the pressure point on me.

1255
01:24:25.52 --> 01:24:27.52
I won't even like fight you back.

1256
01:24:27.52 --> 01:24:28.52
And he did the one like here by the name.

1257
01:24:28.52 --> 01:24:32.52
And I was like, not only does that not hurt right now.

1258
01:24:32.52 --> 01:24:35.52
I mean, I can see it hurts more than if you did it here.

1259
01:24:35.52 --> 01:24:38.52
But not only does that not really hurt that much right now.

1260
01:24:38.52 --> 01:24:40.52
If we were in any kind of fight situation,

1261
01:24:40.52 --> 01:24:42.52
I don't even think I would even notice that.

1262
01:24:42.52 --> 01:24:45.52
Those are his like, oh, yeah, yeah, we'll never get this one.

1263
01:24:45.52 --> 01:24:47.52
And he did one like behind me here and then my ribs.

1264
01:24:47.52 --> 01:24:48.52
He makes acting.

1265
01:24:48.52 --> 01:24:50.52
It's yet. It's more sensitive for sure.

1266
01:24:50.52 --> 01:24:52.52
Yeah, but it's not for us to fight.

1267
01:24:52.52 --> 01:24:57.52
But man, yeah, it simply does not work.

1268
01:24:57.52 --> 01:25:02.52
But the jujitsu, if you know jujitsu, you can still do all those things.

1269
01:25:02.52 --> 01:25:04.52
If you want to do it, but you don't even have to.

1270
01:25:04.52 --> 01:25:06.52
Yeah, because you're going to put them asleep.

1271
01:25:06.52 --> 01:25:10.52
Yeah. And I would say even in my opinion, more accurately,

1272
01:25:10.52 --> 01:25:16.52
jujitsu will help you or it'll give you the ability to control the fight.

1273
01:25:16.52 --> 01:25:21.52
Oh, for sure. So you can, like, if you jujitsu, you're not going to learn how to

1274
01:25:21.52 --> 01:25:23.52
throw like a sick left hook or nothing like that.

1275
01:25:23.52 --> 01:25:25.52
You're not going to learn that.

1276
01:25:25.52 --> 01:25:30.52
But you'll control the fight where if you want to punch someone, you'll be in the perfect position to punch him.

1277
01:25:30.52 --> 01:25:33.52
No matter how much punching training you have, you can have no punching training.

1278
01:25:33.52 --> 01:25:37.52
And you can just, I don't know, just throw your fist out of him in whatever capacity.

1279
01:25:37.52 --> 01:25:39.52
It'll be way more effective when you know jujitsu.

1280
01:25:39.52 --> 01:25:44.52
And that goes for any other one of these moves that people say they'll do.

1281
01:25:44.52 --> 01:25:48.52
If you do jujitsu on them, you're the one going to control the fight.

1282
01:25:48.52 --> 01:25:51.52
I've tried all those people have come to me and I've gone through them all.

1283
01:25:51.52 --> 01:25:58.52
Yeah. No factor. The pressure points to this, the that doesn't work. Sorry. Sorry to tell you.

1284
01:25:58.52 --> 01:26:04.52
It might work like, you know, the risk ones if you sit there.

1285
01:26:04.52 --> 01:26:06.52
Yeah. I'll let them do it and be like, okay, yeah, that hurts.

1286
01:26:06.52 --> 01:26:09.52
And also going against some of that's completely untrained.

1287
01:26:09.52 --> 01:26:14.52
You can have some sort of success with some of this stuff.

1288
01:26:14.52 --> 01:26:18.52
Right. But not against a determined attacker.

1289
01:26:18.52 --> 01:26:23.52
And then that's kind of the point where it's a, yeah, I say, yeah, it might work if you let them do it.

1290
01:26:23.52 --> 01:26:30.52
But that's the thing you don't let them do it. So ultimately, the likelihood of that work is very, very low.

1291
01:26:30.52 --> 01:26:31.52
Just a clear to fairness.

1292
01:26:31.52 --> 01:26:33.52
And you jujitsu's fun.

1293
01:26:33.52 --> 01:26:33.52
Yeah.

1294
01:26:33.52 --> 01:26:34.52
It's creative.

1295
01:26:34.52 --> 01:26:36.52
It's a good workout.

1296
01:26:36.52 --> 01:26:37.52
It ups your confidence.

1297
01:26:37.52 --> 01:26:41.52
It gets you used to come combat of situations where you're going 100%.

1298
01:26:41.52 --> 01:26:42.52
Yeah.

1299
01:26:42.52 --> 01:26:45.52
You get you used to having someone grind on you and trying to smash you.

1300
01:26:45.52 --> 01:26:52.52
And that's a big deal that I didn't even think about where just having someone in girls, especially, or just people who aren't used to confrontation.

1301
01:26:52.52 --> 01:26:53.52
Yeah.

1302
01:26:53.52 --> 01:26:59.52
Man, when you get in a fight, it inoculates you to the terror of having somebody.

1303
01:26:59.52 --> 01:27:03.52
It just ball up on you and trying to smash you.

1304
01:27:03.52 --> 01:27:09.52
In, I want to say, it was you received four, which one was one with our gymmer,

1305
01:27:09.52 --> 01:27:12.52
and with the one glove was that one was one of them.

1306
01:27:12.52 --> 01:27:15.52
So he got mounted and tapped.

1307
01:27:15.52 --> 01:27:16.52
Yeah.

1308
01:27:16.52 --> 01:27:20.52
And man, that's a perfect example. He didn't get punched.

1309
01:27:20.52 --> 01:27:23.52
He didn't tap from any kind of punch or submission.

1310
01:27:23.52 --> 01:27:24.52
He got mounted.

1311
01:27:24.52 --> 01:27:28.52
And then in an interview later, I saw he said, man, I was just feeling claustrophobic over there.

1312
01:27:28.52 --> 01:27:31.52
And if you watch it, he wasn't mounted for very long.

1313
01:27:31.52 --> 01:27:33.52
He was just, man, he just wasn't used to that.

1314
01:27:33.52 --> 01:27:36.52
And in, I'm actually, if that was a real life fight.

1315
01:27:36.52 --> 01:27:39.52
Someone attacks you and they're like, I'm on to it on you and you don't know.

1316
01:27:39.52 --> 01:27:42.52
But you can't tap, man, you're not going to be able to handle that.

1317
01:27:42.52 --> 01:27:45.52
But if you know, you get mounted, that's no factor.

1318
01:27:45.52 --> 01:27:50.52
Some people, they know, mount a skip. So good, where they hold the gate mounted so they can get on top.

1319
01:27:50.52 --> 01:27:53.52
You know? And then, so, compare those two sides of the spectrum.

1320
01:27:53.52 --> 01:27:55.52
Do you get to know the jujitsu?

1321
01:27:55.52 --> 01:27:56.52
No, the jujitsu.

1322
01:27:56.52 --> 01:27:57.52
Yeah.

1323
01:27:59.52 --> 01:28:00.52
Next.

1324
01:28:00.52 --> 01:28:02.52
Next question.

1325
01:28:02.52 --> 01:28:08.52
Can you expand on how to appropriately effectively and tactfully lead up the chain of command?

1326
01:28:08.52 --> 01:28:11.52
You know, profession that's considered to be very paramilitary.

1327
01:28:11.52 --> 01:28:20.52
My line of work sometimes works against this limiting ideas and ways of doing things.

1328
01:28:20.52 --> 01:28:24.52
Yeah. And they're talking about the tradition and their line of work.

1329
01:28:24.52 --> 01:28:30.52
Okay. So what do you do? You got an organization you're working in and you've,

1330
01:28:30.52 --> 01:28:33.52
How do you lead up the chain of command?

1331
01:28:33.52 --> 01:28:45.52
Well, even in a paramilitary organization, which, you know, infers that this is a very hierarchical structure.

1332
01:28:45.52 --> 01:28:47.52
And it's chain of command driven.

1333
01:28:47.52 --> 01:28:52.52
And how do you possibly get your boss to do what you want them to do?

1334
01:28:52.52 --> 01:28:54.52
Mmm.

1335
01:28:54.52 --> 01:29:00.52
Well, it's actually fairly simple, fairly simple, not easy, but simple.

1336
01:29:00.52 --> 01:29:04.52
It is hard to do. It does take a lot more.

1337
01:29:04.52 --> 01:29:06.52
It does take a lot of tact.

1338
01:29:06.52 --> 01:29:09.52
Takes a lot of patience. So number one, you got to build trust.

1339
01:29:09.52 --> 01:29:12.52
You got to build trust with your, the people that are above you and the chain of command.

1340
01:29:12.52 --> 01:29:14.52
You got to build a relationship.

1341
01:29:14.52 --> 01:29:16.52
You got to be proactive. You got to stay ahead.

1342
01:29:16.52 --> 01:29:20.52
You know, when I joined the military, I, you know,

1343
01:29:20.52 --> 01:29:23.52
One day just told my dad, hey, by the way, I joined the, I enlisted in the Navy.

1344
01:29:23.52 --> 01:29:26.52
I'll be going in three weeks or whatever.

1345
01:29:26.52 --> 01:29:29.52
My dad just looked at me and shook his head and he says,

1346
01:29:29.52 --> 01:29:32.52
You're going to hate the military because you hate authority.

1347
01:29:32.52 --> 01:29:34.52
You don't listen to anybody.

1348
01:29:34.52 --> 01:29:37.52
And I was kind of the young stupid kid and I'm like, whatever.

1349
01:29:37.52 --> 01:29:40.52
I'm going in the seal teams. It's a team.

1350
01:29:40.52 --> 01:29:41.52
We don't have to listen to anybody.

1351
01:29:41.52 --> 01:29:43.52
Of course, I was completely wrong.

1352
01:29:43.52 --> 01:29:47.52
You do listen to people and you do have a chain of command.

1353
01:29:47.52 --> 01:29:53.52
But he was right in the fact that I didn't like to listen to people.

1354
01:29:53.52 --> 01:29:55.52
I didn't like authority. So how did I get ahead of that?

1355
01:29:55.52 --> 01:29:56.52
It was pretty easy.

1356
01:29:56.52 --> 01:29:59.52
What I did to get ahead of that was I got ahead of it.

1357
01:29:59.52 --> 01:30:01.52
And that's what you need to do here.

1358
01:30:01.52 --> 01:30:07.52
You have to start that, start that attitude of where you're doing what

1359
01:30:07.52 --> 01:30:10.52
Needs to be done before you get told to do it.

1360
01:30:10.52 --> 01:30:17.52
So you start to appear to have more knowledge and good foresight of what's

1361
01:30:17.52 --> 01:30:20.52
Going to happen. Now you got to be careful that you're not showing up

1362
01:30:20.52 --> 01:30:24.52
The boss. You can't be fond of their face and already did that.

1363
01:30:24.52 --> 01:30:26.52
You know, because I'm so much better than you.

1364
01:30:26.52 --> 01:30:30.52
That's not the goal here. The goal is to build confidence, not to build

1365
01:30:30.52 --> 01:30:33.52
Animosity. You don't want to build Animosity.

1366
01:30:33.52 --> 01:30:36.52
You want to build trust. You want to build confidence.

1367
01:30:36.52 --> 01:30:41.52
You want to make that person start to realize how good you are.

1368
01:30:41.52 --> 01:30:44.52
Again, be careful not to throw it in their face.

1369
01:30:44.52 --> 01:30:47.52
Now the tradition piece.

1370
01:30:47.52 --> 01:30:52.52
And sometimes people do cling on to the traditions.

1371
01:30:52.52 --> 01:30:57.52
And they use the traditions to shut down evolution.

1372
01:30:57.52 --> 01:31:03.52
And that's bad because what they're really doing is they're protecting their

1373
01:31:03.52 --> 01:31:09.52
World, they're protecting their existence.

1374
01:31:09.52 --> 01:31:15.52
And so that's a big wall. That's a big hard wall to get through.

1375
01:31:15.52 --> 01:31:19.52
Now most people do have traditions and traditions.

1376
01:31:19.52 --> 01:31:21.52
What are traditions built on?

1377
01:31:21.52 --> 01:31:25.52
Do we build traditions on their traditions of failure and we're proud of that?

1378
01:31:25.52 --> 01:31:27.52
Are the traditions of losing or not?

1379
01:31:27.52 --> 01:31:29.52
No, no, no. The traditions are proud traditions.

1380
01:31:29.52 --> 01:31:32.52
The traditions of winning their traditions of excellence.

1381
01:31:32.52 --> 01:31:38.52
And in some way, traditions of excellence and traditions of winning

1382
01:31:38.52 --> 01:31:47.52
and traditions of domination have to be tied in some way to evolving and to

1383
01:31:47.52 --> 01:31:52.52
adapting and to getting better because that's how we win.

1384
01:31:52.52 --> 01:31:59.52
That's how we dominate. So you have to find that whole in the tradition that part of the tradition

1385
01:31:59.52 --> 01:32:05.52
that implies that what we do in our tradition is we get better.

1386
01:32:05.52 --> 01:32:09.52
That's all it is. You just kind of find that thing that says we get better.

1387
01:32:09.52 --> 01:32:15.52
We win. And you take that and you carry that lead, that little crack in the armor of

1388
01:32:15.52 --> 01:32:20.52
the tradition and you turn that into, you know, yeah, we have a proud tradition because we're the best.

1389
01:32:20.52 --> 01:32:23.52
And if you're going to be the best, is the best stagnate?

1390
01:32:23.52 --> 01:32:28.52
No, the best evolves. And again, you've got to be careful. You can't fool this in their face.

1391
01:32:28.52 --> 01:32:31.52
You've got to say, hey, you know what? Our traditions that we're the best.

1392
01:32:31.52 --> 01:32:34.52
We make things happen and we get things done.

1393
01:32:34.52 --> 01:32:37.52
And we always do it better than everyone else.

1394
01:32:37.52 --> 01:32:41.52
So you know what? Here's one way we could do it better.

1395
01:32:41.52 --> 01:32:49.52
We did this. You got to look for those little cracks in the tradition to bring forward change.

1396
01:32:49.52 --> 01:32:55.52
Now, again, the most important thing that was you got to continue build that relationship with your

1397
01:32:55.52 --> 01:32:58.52
superiors. You're constantly trying to build that.

1398
01:32:58.52 --> 01:33:01.52
I've said this before and I'll say it again, no matter who I ever worked for.

1399
01:33:01.52 --> 01:33:05.52
I had the same relationship with the crazy boss with the knucklehead boss with the loser with the

1400
01:33:05.52 --> 01:33:08.52
great guy. Had the same relationship all the time and that was they trusted me.

1401
01:33:08.52 --> 01:33:14.52
Didn't matter who I worked for. So you got to build that relationship of trust.

1402
01:33:14.52 --> 01:33:21.52
You've also got to be careful that as you're trying to be proactive and as you're trying to get things done,

1403
01:33:21.52 --> 01:33:28.52
that you're not looking to do it for your own ego to get credit because that disturbs the people at the top.

1404
01:33:28.52 --> 01:33:31.52
That it makes them say, oh, he's just trying to shine. He's just trying to look good.

1405
01:33:31.52 --> 01:33:35.52
Screw him, throw his ideas out. That's what you got to watch out for.

1406
01:33:35.52 --> 01:33:40.52
So that's your ego. Don't make your ego fight there.

1407
01:33:40.52 --> 01:33:44.52
You go because they've got to need to go to you want to let your ego go.

1408
01:33:44.52 --> 01:33:47.52
Build that relationship.

1409
01:33:47.52 --> 01:33:50.52
Make the change slow.

1410
01:33:50.52 --> 01:33:51.52
It's going to be slow.

1411
01:33:51.52 --> 01:33:56.52
Steady and it's going to take persistence in the long war.

1412
01:33:56.52 --> 01:33:59.52
Don't you've got to have patience.

1413
01:33:59.52 --> 01:34:02.52
Tradition doesn't break down overnight.

1414
01:34:02.52 --> 01:34:09.52
Tradition takes time to morph. So you got to be ready for that long war and don't get frustrated.

1415
01:34:09.52 --> 01:34:14.52
You're a part of a winning team. You're part of team that has a proud tradition.

1416
01:34:14.52 --> 01:34:18.52
You just got to add to that tradition and that's going to take time.

1417
01:34:18.52 --> 01:34:22.52
That's how you do it.

1418
01:34:22.52 --> 01:34:25.52
Next question.

1419
01:34:25.52 --> 01:34:28.52
Hi guys. How about on a podcast?

1420
01:34:28.52 --> 01:34:36.52
Talk about what is the essential equipment for a home gym?

1421
01:34:36.52 --> 01:34:43.52
Okay. So for me first of all, if you have nothing, if you're building from zero,

1422
01:34:43.52 --> 01:34:49.52
the first thing you need is pull a bar, a pull a bar, and a dip bar.

1423
01:34:49.52 --> 01:34:52.52
Somewhere there are new dips and somewhere to do pull ups.

1424
01:34:52.52 --> 01:34:56.52
And that's what you need. Now be careful. If you're listening and you're like, okay,

1425
01:34:56.52 --> 01:35:03.52
I'm going to go buy a pull up arm and a dip bar. Don't get the little flimsy looking things that cost

1426
01:35:03.52 --> 01:35:11.52
$129. You don't want that. It's almost worthless. It's better than nothing, but it's almost worthless.

1427
01:35:11.52 --> 01:35:15.52
You want to get a legit dip bar and a legit pull up.

1428
01:35:15.52 --> 01:35:21.52
Our dip bars are a little bit easier. You can go pretty cheesy on dip bars, but pull up bars you can't pull up bars.

1429
01:35:21.52 --> 01:35:28.52
You need something legit, strong. You can bolt it to your wall, but you need a nice pull up bar with a

1430
01:35:28.52 --> 01:35:36.52
inch and a half or a two inch metal pipe. I still have a pull up bar that I bought from a home depot.

1431
01:35:36.52 --> 01:35:41.52
I bought it in 1998. I've had it ever since.

1432
01:35:41.52 --> 01:35:48.52
And it's bolted on to my squat rack. But that's all this piece of, you know, two inch pipe.

1433
01:35:48.52 --> 01:35:53.52
And that's what you do pull ups on. So when you say, it makes your it's legit. Why is that?

1434
01:35:53.52 --> 01:35:57.52
So you don't, so it doesn't break while you're using it. Basically.

1435
01:35:57.52 --> 01:36:01.52
Yeah, and also it's going to have some weight to it. You can do keeping pull ups.

1436
01:36:01.52 --> 01:36:05.52
So you're not things not shaking on the place. You get, you see these, I mean, this is just going

1437
01:36:05.52 --> 01:36:12.52
to total cheese ball that things with like the foam handles that just rotate and fall off.

1438
01:36:12.52 --> 01:36:15.52
And they're just, it's just a nightmare. You want to, what you need is a pipe.

1439
01:36:15.52 --> 01:36:20.52
That's what you need is a piece of pipe from home depot.

1440
01:36:20.52 --> 01:36:26.52
And then you need somewhere to do dips. Now, one thing that you can do that will cover both

1441
01:36:26.52 --> 01:36:33.52
these is you can get rings. You know, gymnastics rings. And you can have, you can adjust the height of the

1442
01:36:33.52 --> 01:36:37.52
rings and you can do dips and pull ups on rings. And then you can do muscle ups as well.

1443
01:36:37.52 --> 01:36:42.52
So rings are also like, if there's one thing you could have. If you can have one piece of

1444
01:36:42.52 --> 01:36:49.52
equipment for working out, it probably be smart to go with just wooden rings.

1445
01:36:49.52 --> 01:36:53.52
Because that there are that flexible and you can do that much different stuff.

1446
01:36:53.52 --> 01:36:57.52
You can do dips. You can do muscle ups. You can do pull ups. You can do pushups.

1447
01:36:57.52 --> 01:37:01.52
You can do all kinds of stuff. You can do levers. You can do front levers.

1448
01:37:01.52 --> 01:37:04.52
Back levers. There's all kinds of gymnastics moves. You can do, I mean, you could basically

1449
01:37:04.52 --> 01:37:10.52
work for the rest of your life on rings and be good to go. So rings are a way of handling the whole

1450
01:37:10.52 --> 01:37:17.52
pull-up and dip bar situation. But, and that's why it's pretty much the number two thing

1451
01:37:17.52 --> 01:37:25.52
for me is is pull-up bar dip bar slash rings. Because those are all going to kind of get you

1452
01:37:25.52 --> 01:37:33.52
those basic body movements to build your strength. Once you get past that, now it's time for a

1453
01:37:33.52 --> 01:37:39.52
squat rack. It's got to have a squat rack. And as soon as you have a squat rack, now my

1454
01:37:39.52 --> 01:37:46.52
squat rack has a pull-up bar on it, which I bolted on myself. My squat rack is the same

1455
01:37:46.52 --> 01:37:53.52
year when I bought my first house immediately had a garage gym. Those 20, I don't know,

1456
01:37:53.52 --> 01:37:57.52
27 years ago or something like that. Built a garage gym immediately.

1457
01:37:57.52 --> 01:38:00.52
A squat rack still have the same squat rack.

1458
01:38:00.52 --> 01:38:05.52
Bolton a pull-up bar onto it. Still have that. I modified it a little bit and made dip bar.

1459
01:38:05.52 --> 01:38:10.52
So I had a dip bar on it. This is before you could buy gym nastickers. I didn't know how to

1460
01:38:10.52 --> 01:38:16.52
get a hold of gymnastics rings back in those days. And then the next thing you need is you need

1461
01:38:16.52 --> 01:38:26.52
an Olympic lifting bar and and bumper plates. And so you can do your squats, your

1462
01:38:26.52 --> 01:38:36.52
clean and jerks, your dead lifts, and all your basic strength movements. After that for me,

1463
01:38:36.52 --> 01:38:44.52
I think kettle belts. You know, so now you have, you can do your swings. You can do your

1464
01:38:44.52 --> 01:38:51.52
farmers, walks. You can do your snatches. I mean, there's a ton of exercises, Turkish get-up.

1465
01:38:51.52 --> 01:38:55.52
I mean, there's a ton of exercises that you can do there that kettlebells now add to

1466
01:38:55.52 --> 01:39:02.52
this situation. And you can do some really psychotic conditioning, metabolic conditioning

1467
01:39:02.52 --> 01:39:09.52
with the addition of kettlebells as well. At this point, if you only have one set of rings,

1468
01:39:09.52 --> 01:39:13.52
I have three sets of rings and I have one that's high for muscle ups. I have one that's medium

1469
01:39:13.52 --> 01:39:18.52
for dips and I have one that's low for pushups. And I just have those all the times.

1470
01:39:18.52 --> 01:39:23.52
Then you have to adjust them because I get some too lazy to one or just my rings all the time.

1471
01:39:23.52 --> 01:39:34.52
So, the next piece for me is, I like rollers, the concept two rollers. I have one I've had it for a

1472
01:39:34.52 --> 01:39:42.52
long time. They're brutal work out. I think that you can just destroy yourself very easily and

1473
01:39:42.52 --> 01:39:48.52
very quickly. And I think like an air diner and air soul type bike, I don't have one of those

1474
01:39:48.52 --> 01:39:54.52
that I can get one very soon. But I think those are outstanding as well. I didn't say jump

1475
01:39:54.52 --> 01:39:59.52
roparle here. That's another good kind of cardio kind of metcon kind of get after it.

1476
01:39:59.52 --> 01:40:07.52
And then maybe some medicine balls. And after that, I mean, I think the question was a

1477
01:40:07.52 --> 01:40:13.52
sensual equipment to me that's sort of my list. And then from there it just becomes fun.

1478
01:40:13.52 --> 01:40:18.52
You know, it becomes what kind of other implements can I bring into the situation that are going to

1479
01:40:18.52 --> 01:40:26.52
eliminate boredom increase creativity, increase dynamic and functional movement.

1480
01:40:26.52 --> 01:40:35.52
And I think these are pretty good. And this is all stuff that's pretty common nowadays. There's a bunch of different places to get it and make it happen.

1481
01:40:35.52 --> 01:40:40.52
Yes, especially when you kind of start with kind of one thing and you slowly just add on.

1482
01:40:40.52 --> 01:40:46.52
Yeah. And essential that's kind of a complex question anyway to begin with and you did say for you.

1483
01:40:46.52 --> 01:40:52.52
Right. So it depends on what kind of gym you're doing, like what kind of results you want.

1484
01:40:52.52 --> 01:41:02.52
You know, well, everyone that's listening to this podcast wants to just peak physical conditioning in a broad array of

1485
01:41:02.52 --> 01:41:14.52
environments and tasks, right? I would assume that as well, but it's not necessarily a fact. So like I'm just saying if they have different goals, but

1486
01:41:14.52 --> 01:41:16.52
name is going to look different.

1487
01:41:16.52 --> 01:41:19.52
Name a goal that won't be covered by this.

1488
01:41:19.52 --> 01:41:21.52
You can't they want to get their bench up.

1489
01:41:21.52 --> 01:41:26.52
Okay. That's one. If you want, if you want to get your bench up, you need to bench.

1490
01:41:26.52 --> 01:41:27.52
Yeah.

1491
01:41:27.52 --> 01:41:31.52
Yeah. I think your list is pretty elaborate because so it's my opinion.

1492
01:41:31.52 --> 01:41:35.52
Oh, because you're going to break it down because you're like a minimalist over here when it comes to work and out.

1493
01:41:35.52 --> 01:41:36.52
No.

1494
01:41:36.52 --> 01:41:38.52
Let's hear a new list.

1495
01:41:38.52 --> 01:41:40.52
Well, essential equipment.

1496
01:41:40.52 --> 01:41:42.52
Right. I would say the.

1497
01:41:42.52 --> 01:41:44.52
I've managed to depend. So yeah.

1498
01:41:44.52 --> 01:41:45.52
Okay.

1499
01:41:45.52 --> 01:41:49.52
If you want, yes, it depends on what you what results you want.

1500
01:41:49.52 --> 01:41:56.52
So if you just want to be a bodybuilder with big muscles, go to listen to a different podcast.

1501
01:41:56.52 --> 01:41:58.52
That's that the question.

1502
01:41:58.52 --> 01:42:01.52
The question. The people that are asking these questions are listening to this podcast.

1503
01:42:01.52 --> 01:42:04.52
They're into physical fitness. They want to be healthy.

1504
01:42:04.52 --> 01:42:06.52
They want to be juit to players. They want to be fighters.

1505
01:42:06.52 --> 01:42:09.52
They want to be able to functionally move well.

1506
01:42:09.52 --> 01:42:11.52
They want to stay healthy.

1507
01:42:11.52 --> 01:42:15.52
They're not just getting their bodybuilder on.

1508
01:42:15.52 --> 01:42:15.52
Okay.

1509
01:42:15.52 --> 01:42:16.52
That's still.

1510
01:42:16.52 --> 01:42:17.52
Is it a assumption though?

1511
01:42:17.52 --> 01:42:17.52
Yes.

1512
01:42:17.52 --> 01:42:19.52
Correct assumption.

1513
01:42:19.52 --> 01:42:20.52
We're a sake of efficiency.

1514
01:42:20.52 --> 01:42:23.52
I'm going to go ahead and and I'm going to let you.

1515
01:42:23.52 --> 01:42:24.52
I'll tell you what.

1516
01:42:24.52 --> 01:42:25.52
Make that assumption as well.

1517
01:42:25.52 --> 01:42:27.52
One minute to control the rest.

1518
01:42:27.52 --> 01:42:30.52
It's not about completing the list.

1519
01:42:30.52 --> 01:42:32.52
I was going to elaborate a little bit more.

1520
01:42:32.52 --> 01:42:33.52
But do.

1521
01:42:33.52 --> 01:42:36.52
No, I think that I actually agree with you.

1522
01:42:36.52 --> 01:42:38.52
You don't have a new elaboration.

1523
01:42:38.52 --> 01:42:40.52
There's one more thing you probably added a bench on there.

1524
01:42:40.52 --> 01:42:41.52
Yeah.

1525
01:42:41.52 --> 01:42:42.52
Is that what you down on?

1526
01:42:42.52 --> 01:42:43.52
Anything else?

1527
01:42:43.52 --> 01:42:43.52
Yeah.

1528
01:42:43.52 --> 01:42:45.52
Or anything that would though.

1529
01:42:45.52 --> 01:42:45.52
Yeah.

1530
01:42:45.52 --> 01:42:50.52
That would facilitate the same thing a bench would facilitate.

1531
01:42:50.52 --> 01:42:51.52
I was mad.

1532
01:42:51.52 --> 01:42:53.52
It's pretty pretty good list.

1533
01:42:53.52 --> 01:42:53.52
I think.

1534
01:42:53.52 --> 01:42:54.52
Yeah. I think that's.

1535
01:42:54.52 --> 01:42:57.52
Yeah, that's a big time.

1536
01:42:57.52 --> 01:42:59.52
I think that's the deluxe list though, man.

1537
01:42:59.52 --> 01:43:00.52
I think you could cut a few.

1538
01:43:00.52 --> 01:43:02.52
Like I said, it's still good.

1539
01:43:02.52 --> 01:43:04.52
It's an escalation though.

1540
01:43:04.52 --> 01:43:04.52
Yeah.

1541
01:43:04.52 --> 01:43:06.52
If someone's listening right now, they're like, you know what?

1542
01:43:06.52 --> 01:43:07.52
I'm going to go get in shape.

1543
01:43:07.52 --> 01:43:10.52
First thing you do is get a set of rings that you can do pull those.

1544
01:43:10.52 --> 01:43:12.52
That's not why I got you.

1545
01:43:12.52 --> 01:43:14.52
Then you can get a squat rack.

1546
01:43:14.52 --> 01:43:17.52
Then you the squat racks can come with a pull up arm and a dead bar somehow.

1547
01:43:17.52 --> 01:43:19.52
So you're good there.

1548
01:43:19.52 --> 01:43:22.52
Then you then you got to get the bar and bumper plates, right?

1549
01:43:22.52 --> 01:43:27.52
Which you can escalate. You can start with a start with just a bar and, you know,

1550
01:43:27.52 --> 01:43:30.52
to 25 pound bumper plates.

1551
01:43:30.52 --> 01:43:35.52
And then every month by another 45 pounds or 100 pounds or whatever and you're good.

1552
01:43:35.52 --> 01:43:37.52
After you see the gains.

1553
01:43:37.52 --> 01:43:39.52
After you start jacking the biggest deal.

1554
01:43:39.52 --> 01:43:45.52
The thing about home gyms is if you work out at home, especially this, these kinds of workouts,

1555
01:43:45.52 --> 01:43:49.52
you get more of a testosterone boost.

1556
01:43:49.52 --> 01:43:55.52
If you work out at a public gym, like at a 24-footness or crossfit gym or something,

1557
01:43:55.52 --> 01:43:57.52
which gives you more.

1558
01:43:57.52 --> 01:44:00.52
If you work out, well basically if you work out in front of people.

1559
01:44:00.52 --> 01:44:04.52
If there's other people around, you get a testosterone boost.

1560
01:44:04.52 --> 01:44:05.52
How come I'm still in the new wood?

1561
01:44:05.52 --> 01:44:10.52
It's this thing where, I don't know, it's this weird,

1562
01:44:10.52 --> 01:44:13.52
some guy did an experiment long time ago where, I don't know how long ago,

1563
01:44:13.52 --> 01:44:18.52
but he did an experiment where he found out all these little things that you can do in front of

1564
01:44:18.52 --> 01:44:20.52
people that'll boost your testosterone.

1565
01:44:20.52 --> 01:44:23.52
One was like drive a car, like a certain kind of car.

1566
01:44:23.52 --> 01:44:28.52
And if you do it in front of people, it boosts your testosterone.

1567
01:44:28.52 --> 01:44:34.52
So if you, and not only do you get that, you get psychological mental priming as well.

1568
01:44:34.52 --> 01:44:39.52
So when you walk in the gym, like the crossfit gym, all the smells, the sounds,

1569
01:44:39.52 --> 01:44:43.52
and all that basically primes your mind and your physiology for a workout.

1570
01:44:43.52 --> 01:44:47.52
So, I'll tell you at home, I mean, I'm sure you could do that.

1571
01:44:47.52 --> 01:44:51.52
I don't think he would replace that actually being there.

1572
01:44:51.52 --> 01:44:52.52
Just that part of it.

1573
01:44:52.52 --> 01:44:54.52
I'm not saying home gym, I'm not saying that at all.

1574
01:44:54.52 --> 01:44:56.52
Yeah, no, because when I walk in my home gym,

1575
01:44:56.52 --> 01:44:59.52
for your prime, I feel like I feel brim.

1576
01:44:59.52 --> 01:45:02.52
Yeah, see, and that's part of it as well.

1577
01:45:02.52 --> 01:45:06.52
So, the whole reason, the whole reason I set up home gym was,

1578
01:45:06.52 --> 01:45:10.52
so I don't have to make that drive to the gym and, you know,

1579
01:45:10.52 --> 01:45:12.52
but that kind of works against it.

1580
01:45:12.52 --> 01:45:15.52
It's interesting that you use that.

1581
01:45:15.52 --> 01:45:19.52
Like, I say, hey, I have a home gym,

1582
01:45:19.52 --> 01:45:23.52
so I can just be alone in the gathering of doom

1583
01:45:23.52 --> 01:45:25.52
and just get after it.

1584
01:45:25.52 --> 01:45:28.52
And bother me, and I can be alone in my main world of pain,

1585
01:45:28.52 --> 01:45:30.52
improving myself.

1586
01:45:30.52 --> 01:45:31.52
Yeah.

1587
01:45:31.52 --> 01:45:33.52
And you did it, because you're too lazy to go to the gym.

1588
01:45:33.52 --> 01:45:35.52
Yeah, to make that drive is just more of a pain.

1589
01:45:35.52 --> 01:45:36.52
I can say this at a time.

1590
01:45:36.52 --> 01:45:37.52
Yeah.

1591
01:45:37.52 --> 01:45:39.52
Right, which it is an efficiency thing for sure.

1592
01:45:39.52 --> 01:45:42.52
Yeah, but that efficiency thing can come back for you.

1593
01:45:42.52 --> 01:45:45.52
You're back for who you are. Yeah, it'll back for, like, for example,

1594
01:45:45.52 --> 01:45:49.52
I'll be like, I don't have to,

1595
01:45:49.52 --> 01:45:52.52
you feel like you don't have to get the most out of your workout,

1596
01:45:52.52 --> 01:45:55.52
because I could just come right back here, you know,

1597
01:45:55.52 --> 01:45:59.52
in an hour when I quote unquote, feel better or when I feel more like doing it.

1598
01:45:59.52 --> 01:46:01.52
Or the TV's right there and look at it.

1599
01:46:01.52 --> 01:46:03.52
So, it's like on.

1600
01:46:03.52 --> 01:46:05.52
It's a lack of discipline.

1601
01:46:05.52 --> 01:46:07.52
Yeah, it can be.

1602
01:46:07.52 --> 01:46:10.52
And if you're looking for helpers for that discipline,

1603
01:46:10.52 --> 01:46:12.52
you can just go home gym.

1604
01:46:12.52 --> 01:46:14.52
It could go either way, man.

1605
01:46:14.52 --> 01:46:16.52
Yeah, because I personally,

1606
01:46:16.52 --> 01:46:22.52
I'm able to work out sometimes only because I have a home gym.

1607
01:46:22.52 --> 01:46:23.52
Yeah.

1608
01:46:23.52 --> 01:46:25.52
You know, in other words, my time is in a day.

1609
01:46:25.52 --> 01:46:26.52
Yeah.

1610
01:46:26.52 --> 01:46:27.52
I'll get up super early.

1611
01:46:27.52 --> 01:46:31.52
And if I wouldn't be able to hit my own gym quickly in 30 minutes and get a workout,

1612
01:46:31.52 --> 01:46:32.52
and I wouldn't be able to get, you know,

1613
01:46:32.52 --> 01:46:34.52
take me 30 minutes, just get your gym and back.

1614
01:46:34.52 --> 01:46:35.52
Yeah.

1615
01:46:35.52 --> 01:46:36.52
Yeah.

1616
01:46:36.52 --> 01:46:38.52
Well, I recommend if you make a home gym,

1617
01:46:38.52 --> 01:46:41.52
you do it in a positive way to increase your discipline.

1618
01:46:41.52 --> 01:46:43.52
That's what I recommend.

1619
01:46:43.52 --> 01:46:44.52
Yeah.

1620
01:46:44.52 --> 01:46:47.52
I like all, you know, your home gym is kind of separate.

1621
01:46:47.52 --> 01:46:48.52
From my house.

1622
01:46:48.52 --> 01:46:49.52
Yeah.

1623
01:46:49.52 --> 01:46:50.52
You have to kind of go to it.

1624
01:46:50.52 --> 01:46:51.52
Yeah.

1625
01:46:51.52 --> 01:46:52.52
So I do get to escape.

1626
01:46:52.52 --> 01:46:53.52
Yeah.

1627
01:46:53.52 --> 01:46:55.52
I feel like that's a big factor.

1628
01:46:55.52 --> 01:46:58.52
Mine is like right outside next to the barbecue.

1629
01:46:58.52 --> 01:46:59.52
Yeah.

1630
01:46:59.52 --> 01:47:01.52
You don't know whether you want to.

1631
01:47:01.52 --> 01:47:02.52
Yeah.

1632
01:47:02.52 --> 01:47:04.52
I don't know how cruising or lifting, you know?

1633
01:47:04.52 --> 01:47:05.52
Yeah.

1634
01:47:05.52 --> 01:47:06.52
It's rough for a couple of girls.

1635
01:47:06.52 --> 01:47:08.52
It doesn't know if he's cruising or lifting.

1636
01:47:08.52 --> 01:47:09.52
Next question.

1637
01:47:09.52 --> 01:47:10.52
Okay.

1638
01:47:10.52 --> 01:47:14.52
Podcast question.

1639
01:47:14.52 --> 01:47:18.52
How does it feel to do Tim Paris podcast,

1640
01:47:18.52 --> 01:47:22.52
Joroggin podcast and get thousands of followers listening to your podcast,

1641
01:47:22.52 --> 01:47:24.52
reading your book, etc.

1642
01:47:24.52 --> 01:47:27.52
Do you worry that some of your fans place you on a pedestal

1643
01:47:27.52 --> 01:47:31.52
and engage in hero worship?

1644
01:47:31.52 --> 01:47:32.52
Yeah.

1645
01:47:32.52 --> 01:47:35.52
So this is a question that I was actually not going to do because I was a little bit uncomfortable.

1646
01:47:35.52 --> 01:47:38.52
And then I was like, okay, why you uncomfortable with it?

1647
01:47:38.52 --> 01:47:40.52
It's not that big of a deal.

1648
01:47:40.52 --> 01:47:45.52
Although I will say like it does make me feel uncomfortable to think of people

1649
01:47:45.52 --> 01:47:50.52
thinking of me in a heroic way or whatever.

1650
01:47:50.52 --> 01:47:55.52
That does feel strange to me.

1651
01:47:55.52 --> 01:48:02.52
As far as being on Rogan in Paris and Sam Harris and doing some of these podcasts,

1652
01:48:02.52 --> 01:48:06.52
it's, you know, it was really cool.

1653
01:48:06.52 --> 01:48:12.52
It's definitely, you know, meeting people all the time.

1654
01:48:12.52 --> 01:48:19.52
As I travel and meeting people that have read our book and and they've gotten a lot out of it.

1655
01:48:19.52 --> 01:48:21.52
You know, and that that feels very rewarding.

1656
01:48:21.52 --> 01:48:22.52
You know, it feels very rewarding.

1657
01:48:22.52 --> 01:48:25.52
It feels great when someone says, hey, you know, I use this chapter or hey,

1658
01:48:25.52 --> 01:48:26.52
your book.

1659
01:48:26.52 --> 01:48:30.52
I mean, people are saying that your book changed my life and I take that with a grain of salt,

1660
01:48:30.52 --> 01:48:32.52
but it feels, it feels good.

1661
01:48:32.52 --> 01:48:35.52
It feels positive, you know, it feels, I like that.

1662
01:48:35.52 --> 01:48:37.52
You know, I want to help people.

1663
01:48:37.52 --> 01:48:39.52
And so that feels good.

1664
01:48:39.52 --> 01:48:45.52
But as far as it's not, it like like my social media presence,

1665
01:48:45.52 --> 01:48:49.52
which I had zero before and now I have it.

1666
01:48:49.52 --> 01:48:58.52
And it's, it's not really that big of a deal because it's just me.

1667
01:48:58.52 --> 01:49:02.52
I'm still just me.

1668
01:49:02.52 --> 01:49:10.52
And there's no, there's nothing that's different or has changed.

1669
01:49:10.52 --> 01:49:14.52
And when we talk about doing this podcast,

1670
01:49:14.52 --> 01:49:21.52
we don't talk about how we should act or how I should act

1671
01:49:21.52 --> 01:49:24.52
to get more people to listen to it.

1672
01:49:24.52 --> 01:49:29.52
I'm only doing what I'm doing because this is me.

1673
01:49:29.52 --> 01:49:35.52
And I'm not going to be different in order to achieve anything else.

1674
01:49:35.52 --> 01:49:38.52
I'm only going to be who I am.

1675
01:49:38.52 --> 01:49:44.52
And that's why the font of people putting me on a pedestal or whatever.

1676
01:49:44.52 --> 01:49:51.52
That's, I know that I'm just a person.

1677
01:49:51.52 --> 01:49:58.52
And I think that it might be how I get presented,

1678
01:49:58.52 --> 01:50:04.52
you know, by the media, how I get presented, even on this podcast.

1679
01:50:04.52 --> 01:50:06.52
When I'm on this podcast talking to you,

1680
01:50:06.52 --> 01:50:11.52
we're talking about specific subjects that we are interested in.

1681
01:50:11.52 --> 01:50:15.52
And it's not, you know, I could see where someone might think,

1682
01:50:15.52 --> 01:50:21.52
oh, you know, joc was this super, you know, superhuman.

1683
01:50:21.52 --> 01:50:23.52
And, you know, I know I'm not.

1684
01:50:23.52 --> 01:50:25.52
So if I come across like that,

1685
01:50:25.52 --> 01:50:29.52
it's only because you're seeing a sliver of me that appears that way.

1686
01:50:29.52 --> 01:50:33.52
You know, I'm not saying I'm, I know I'm not totally normal as well.

1687
01:50:33.52 --> 01:50:36.52
I mean, I know I'm not a normal person.

1688
01:50:36.52 --> 01:50:39.52
I know I'm a little bit to the, to the edge of, you know,

1689
01:50:39.52 --> 01:50:41.52
being a little bit extreme.

1690
01:50:41.52 --> 01:50:44.52
Yeah, a little bit extreme is ish in some ways.

1691
01:50:44.52 --> 01:50:45.52
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1692
01:50:45.52 --> 01:50:49.52
And I know a lot of that just has to do with my habits as a person.

1693
01:50:49.52 --> 01:50:58.52
But the fact of the matter is that no matter what happens,

1694
01:50:58.52 --> 01:51:00.52
no matter what I come across.

1695
01:51:00.52 --> 01:51:05.52
And no matter what people might perceive me as,

1696
01:51:05.52 --> 01:51:13.52
I don't perceive myself as special or as a hero for sure.

1697
01:51:13.52 --> 01:51:18.52
Because and one thing that will not,

1698
01:51:18.52 --> 01:51:23.52
that will always stay with me is that

1699
01:51:23.52 --> 01:51:28.52
I've been in combat and I've been humbled by combat.

1700
01:51:28.52 --> 01:51:34.52
And I think that I've been on the battlefield and I've been confused.

1701
01:51:34.52 --> 01:51:39.52
And I've been out maneuvered and I've had my guys killed.

1702
01:51:39.52 --> 01:51:48.52
And so I know what a real hero is and it ain't me.

1703
01:51:48.52 --> 01:51:55.52
And that's always gonna keep me grounded.

1704
01:51:55.52 --> 01:51:59.52
And I will never forget that.

1705
01:51:59.52 --> 01:52:05.52
Yeah, and you, it's far as being worried about people putting you on a pedestal.

1706
01:52:05.52 --> 01:52:07.52
Like how you're saying.

1707
01:52:07.52 --> 01:52:11.52
You just, you be you and that's all you're gonna do is be you.

1708
01:52:11.52 --> 01:52:14.52
You're not trying to live up to anyone's expectation.

1709
01:52:14.52 --> 01:52:16.52
That's never a goal of yours.

1710
01:52:16.52 --> 01:52:17.52
No.

1711
01:52:17.52 --> 01:52:21.52
So if someone has an expectation since that's not your goal,

1712
01:52:21.52 --> 01:52:22.52
how can you worry about it?

1713
01:52:22.52 --> 01:52:24.52
You can continue to be you.

1714
01:52:24.52 --> 01:52:27.52
And it is, I think, I don't know if it's irony,

1715
01:52:27.52 --> 01:52:31.52
but the more you do that and just be just authentic or whatever.

1716
01:52:31.52 --> 01:52:35.52
It seems to draw more people to you.

1717
01:52:35.52 --> 01:52:39.52
I guess, but I don't know because I'm not acting any other way

1718
01:52:39.52 --> 01:52:43.52
than I acted a year ago or you know, four years ago.

1719
01:52:43.52 --> 01:52:49.52
I'm just, you know what I do? I try and get smarter.

1720
01:52:49.52 --> 01:52:53.52
I try and do better.

1721
01:52:53.52 --> 01:52:53.52
Yeah.

1722
01:52:53.52 --> 01:52:55.52
You know, that's what I do.

1723
01:52:55.52 --> 01:52:56.52
Yeah.

1724
01:52:56.52 --> 01:53:01.52
So, so yeah, I'm just gonna, you know, I'm me.

1725
01:53:01.52 --> 01:53:04.52
And I actually, I'll tell you, this is interesting.

1726
01:53:04.52 --> 01:53:09.52
Is that people that I interact with now?

1727
01:53:09.52 --> 01:53:12.52
I enjoy it and I get something out of it.

1728
01:53:12.52 --> 01:53:14.52
I'm taking away.

1729
01:53:14.52 --> 01:53:17.52
They're giving me as much inspiration as I'm giving them.

1730
01:53:17.52 --> 01:53:18.52
Yeah.

1731
01:53:18.52 --> 01:53:22.52
You know, there's one girl on the, on the, on Twitter.

1732
01:53:22.52 --> 01:53:26.52
And I don't want to say her name because I mean,

1733
01:53:26.52 --> 01:53:30.52
it's, I don't know how, I don't like to disrupt people's privacy.

1734
01:53:30.52 --> 01:53:31.52
I mean, she's on Twitter.

1735
01:53:31.52 --> 01:53:35.52
But she's a, clearly, a little bit of an older lady.

1736
01:53:35.52 --> 01:53:40.52
She's, um, she's a cancer survivor.

1737
01:53:40.52 --> 01:53:45.52
I mean, when I say older, I mean, she's in her, at least in her 60s.

1738
01:53:45.52 --> 01:53:49.52
And, and she put a picture on the internet, the other day on Twitter,

1739
01:53:49.52 --> 01:53:54.52
of her at the gym and she's got, you know, like a kettlebell,

1740
01:53:54.52 --> 01:54:00.52
um, a medicine ball, and an oxygen tank.

1741
01:54:00.52 --> 01:54:01.52
And the game.

1742
01:54:01.52 --> 01:54:04.52
Because she's, because she's in there working out.

1743
01:54:04.52 --> 01:54:05.52
Yeah.

1744
01:54:05.52 --> 01:54:08.52
And she's, yeah, I got to bring my oxygen tank because of, you know,

1745
01:54:08.52 --> 01:54:10.52
I don't know, no specifically why.

1746
01:54:10.52 --> 01:54:16.52
But, a man, if she can bring an oxygen tank to the gym and get after it,

1747
01:54:16.52 --> 01:54:23.52
at, you know, age 65 or 70, you know, that's inspiring.

1748
01:54:23.52 --> 01:54:29.52
And, and I can get up and get after it and do my piece, just, you know,

1749
01:54:29.52 --> 01:54:33.52
just, at least just as well as as she could.

1750
01:54:33.52 --> 01:54:37.52
And, and so I think that that's, I think that's what's what's been interesting

1751
01:54:37.52 --> 01:54:40.52
about this is seeing other people that are fired up.

1752
01:54:40.52 --> 01:54:47.52
And, and you know, that's, that's another thing that kind of happened early on in this journey for me.

1753
01:54:47.52 --> 01:54:56.52
I have not a bunch of friends, but one of my friends who's a seal.

1754
01:54:56.52 --> 01:55:03.52
When I was just about, I think I had recorded the Tim Ferriss podcast.

1755
01:55:03.52 --> 01:55:08.52
And I knew it was going to be released.

1756
01:55:08.52 --> 01:55:13.52
And I knew it was going to be heard by people.

1757
01:55:13.52 --> 01:55:17.52
And when I did, when I got back, I texted my friend.

1758
01:55:17.52 --> 01:55:23.52
And I said, hey, I did this podcast.

1759
01:55:23.52 --> 01:55:26.52
And it's going to be released.

1760
01:55:26.52 --> 01:55:30.52
And I'm going to be one of them.

1761
01:55:30.52 --> 01:55:36.52
And when I meant by that was one of these guys that sold out for lack of a better word.

1762
01:55:36.52 --> 01:55:39.52
And I'm out there, you know, oh, I'm a Navy seal.

1763
01:55:39.52 --> 01:55:42.52
And I'm the biggest baddest guy because there's plenty of those guys out there.

1764
01:55:42.52 --> 01:55:44.52
And now I'm going to be one of those guys.

1765
01:55:44.52 --> 01:55:47.52
And so I said, I said, I'm going to be one of them now.

1766
01:55:47.52 --> 01:55:50.52
Sorry.

1767
01:55:50.52 --> 01:55:53.52
And he wrote me back.

1768
01:55:53.52 --> 01:55:58.52
And he said, that's awesome.

1769
01:55:58.52 --> 01:56:05.52
And we got so many guys running around saying all kinds of stuff.

1770
01:56:05.52 --> 01:56:08.52
You should be out there representing.

1771
01:56:08.52 --> 01:56:10.52
You know, you should be.

1772
01:56:10.52 --> 01:56:12.52
And he went on to say something even more powerful.

1773
01:56:12.52 --> 01:56:16.52
And he said, you know what?

1774
01:56:16.52 --> 01:56:21.52
There's a lot of people in this world that need a role model that need a dad.

1775
01:56:21.52 --> 01:56:23.52
I needed a dad.

1776
01:56:23.52 --> 01:56:25.52
I needed a father figure.

1777
01:56:25.52 --> 01:56:27.52
And that's what you were for me.

1778
01:56:27.52 --> 01:56:34.52
And for you to go out there and be out there in the world and be that role model for other people.

1779
01:56:34.52 --> 01:56:35.52
It's awesome.

1780
01:56:35.52 --> 01:56:36.52
And you should do it.

1781
01:56:36.52 --> 01:56:38.52
And I love the fact that you're doing it.

1782
01:56:38.52 --> 01:56:39.52
Yeah.

1783
01:56:39.52 --> 01:56:45.52
And when he wrote that to me, it kind of changed my attitude because I did look at the role models that people look at.

1784
01:56:45.52 --> 01:56:55.52
And I said to myself, and again, I think part of what might make me a good role model is that I don't think I'm a good role model because I'm still trying to get better.

1785
01:56:55.52 --> 01:56:57.52
And I've done all kinds of stupid stuff.

1786
01:56:57.52 --> 01:57:03.52
We need to have a dozen podcasts on the stupid things I've done in my life.

1787
01:57:03.52 --> 01:57:09.52
And talk about the mistakes I've made growing up and all the just, I mean, I'm,

1788
01:57:09.52 --> 01:57:10.52
That's another thing.

1789
01:57:10.52 --> 01:57:14.52
Like when people see me on the podcast or hear me on the podcast or they read the book,

1790
01:57:14.52 --> 01:57:17.52
They're seeing the good part, right?

1791
01:57:17.52 --> 01:57:19.52
They're seeing, I would hesitate to say,

1792
01:57:19.52 --> 01:57:22.52
But they're seeing the best part of me.

1793
01:57:22.52 --> 01:57:23.52
They're seeing a much sure person.

1794
01:57:23.52 --> 01:57:24.52
I'm not that mature.

1795
01:57:24.52 --> 01:57:28.52
But they're seeing the older, the matureist that I've ever been, which is right now.

1796
01:57:28.52 --> 01:57:38.52
They're not seeing the idiot, you know, growing dummy that I was and that many of us were when we were younger.

1797
01:57:38.52 --> 01:57:43.52
Now, I might, I've had a little edge, a little bit of a van,

1798
01:57:43.52 --> 01:57:46.52
Maybe I was a little bit ahead in some cases,

1799
01:57:46.52 --> 01:57:49.52
But man, I didn't, you know?

1800
01:57:49.52 --> 01:58:06.52
And so that, when I got that text, that was a series of text from my brother that really gave me a different attitude on this whole thing.

1801
01:58:06.52 --> 01:58:17.52
So comfortable with the fact that I was selling out and that I was now going to be out there in the public view.

1802
01:58:17.52 --> 01:58:22.52
And, and all this being said, at some point,

1803
01:58:22.52 --> 01:58:26.52
I'm probably going to go right back to the cave that I came from.

1804
01:58:26.52 --> 01:58:33.52
And I'm, I don't want, you know,

1805
01:58:33.52 --> 01:58:37.52
I don't have what Pat and had, which would just like this huge desire to be famous.

1806
01:58:37.52 --> 01:58:43.52
I have no problem not being, I was unrecognizable to the world for my whole life.

1807
01:58:43.52 --> 01:58:47.52
And the fact that I'm a little bit recognizable now, it doesn't make me feel great.

1808
01:58:47.52 --> 01:58:48.52
It doesn't do anything for me.

1809
01:58:48.52 --> 01:58:49.52
Yeah.

1810
01:58:49.52 --> 01:58:50.52
I'm just doing what I do.

1811
01:58:50.52 --> 01:58:51.52
It's not my goal.

1812
01:58:51.52 --> 01:58:54.52
But there is there a goal to try and help some people out there.

1813
01:58:54.52 --> 01:58:57.52
Yes, and I think here that from that body of mine,

1814
01:58:57.52 --> 01:59:00.52
made me solidify that goal a little bit.

1815
01:59:00.52 --> 01:59:05.52
And again, not to try and say, hey, be like me.

1816
01:59:05.52 --> 01:59:09.52
No, it's to say, learn from what I learned from.

1817
01:59:09.52 --> 01:59:10.52
Yeah.

1818
01:59:10.52 --> 01:59:11.52
I did some dumb stuff.

1819
01:59:11.52 --> 01:59:15.52
I've been through some stuff that most people don't have to go through.

1820
01:59:15.52 --> 01:59:17.52
So if you can take something away from it,

1821
01:59:17.52 --> 01:59:21.52
awesome, you know, don't worship me by any stretch.

1822
01:59:21.52 --> 01:59:22.52
Yeah.

1823
01:59:22.52 --> 01:59:25.52
But let's work together and see if we can get better as a team.

1824
01:59:25.52 --> 01:59:26.52
Yeah.

1825
01:59:26.52 --> 01:59:28.52
And you're a good, like,

1826
01:59:28.52 --> 01:59:32.52
a lot of your messages and the things that you say a lot of it is new.

1827
01:59:32.52 --> 01:59:35.52
And then a lot of it's not new, right?

1828
01:59:35.52 --> 01:59:40.52
So, and so this is one point where, and a sum of this stuff,

1829
01:59:40.52 --> 01:59:45.52
people may have heard before, but someone like you who's done what you've done.

1830
01:59:45.52 --> 01:59:48.52
And think the way you think and do what you do right now,

1831
01:59:48.52 --> 01:59:53.52
you're the perfect medium for that, for that information to get passed on to someone.

1832
01:59:53.52 --> 01:59:56.52
You know, like, you know, when you're a teenager or something,

1833
01:59:56.52 --> 01:59:58.52
your dad tells you to do something, your mom tells you to do something.

1834
01:59:58.52 --> 01:59:59.52
You're like, fuck that.

1835
01:59:59.52 --> 02:00:03.52
But then when you go, and then you go to your friend's house and then like he tells you to do it.

1836
02:00:03.52 --> 02:00:04.52
The exact same thing.

1837
02:00:04.52 --> 02:00:07.52
You're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, it just, it takes that same message.

1838
02:00:07.52 --> 02:00:11.52
But from someone who you can, for lack of a bit, better way of putting it.

1839
02:00:11.52 --> 02:00:13.52
Someone you can accept it from.

1840
02:00:13.52 --> 02:00:17.52
And so all your messages are perfectly in line with who you are.

1841
02:00:17.52 --> 02:00:21.52
So they're so, like, you're so eager to accept them.

1842
02:00:21.52 --> 02:00:23.52
You know, so like how you put the, you know,

1843
02:00:23.52 --> 02:00:30.52
online, you're supposed to picture of your watch every morning and you're kind of the work out setting and stuff like that.

1844
02:00:30.52 --> 02:00:37.52
And you're kind of your message, more or less, is get up every morning and get your work done,

1845
02:00:37.52 --> 02:00:39.52
get to work out in whatever, and then you're doing it.

1846
02:00:39.52 --> 02:00:41.52
And there's the proof right there.

1847
02:00:41.52 --> 02:00:44.52
So if you're just some dudes, like, yeah, work out every day and you don't do it,

1848
02:00:44.52 --> 02:00:46.52
that's like, yeah, it's going to be harder to accept.

1849
02:00:46.52 --> 02:00:49.52
So people will get those messages.

1850
02:00:49.52 --> 02:00:53.52
And they'll, they'll internalize them way more readily from someone like you,

1851
02:00:53.52 --> 02:00:57.52
given the messages that you're, you're, you're sending.

1852
02:00:57.52 --> 02:01:05.52
That's one, two, the whole broadcasting yourself thing is totally understandable for someone like you and that,

1853
02:01:05.52 --> 02:01:11.52
that it's good that you kind of got your kind of got turned on to the notion that it's more,

1854
02:01:11.52 --> 02:01:18.52
you have really good messages and good content that will improve people in their,

1855
02:01:18.52 --> 02:01:23.52
in their life, whether it be older people, younger people, girls, guys, everything.

1856
02:01:23.52 --> 02:01:28.52
And this is especially like a podcast situation or even like certain online profiles and stuff,

1857
02:01:28.52 --> 02:01:33.52
they're good ways to get that information out that people need men, like to improve themselves.

1858
02:01:33.52 --> 02:01:38.52
Like if you're in a, in a neighborhood or an environment with a bunch of people improving themselves,

1859
02:01:38.52 --> 02:01:40.52
that's going to be a good neighborhood.

1860
02:01:40.52 --> 02:01:46.52
And if they have the means to improve themselves, then that's a good service that you're putting out there.

1861
02:01:46.52 --> 02:01:53.52
And, and to reach as many people as you do, you're essentially, you're helping the world with your message.

1862
02:01:53.52 --> 02:01:56.52
Well, okay.

1863
02:01:56.52 --> 02:01:57.52
I'm telling you.

1864
02:01:57.52 --> 02:02:00.52
So I'm saying broadcasting yourself is a good thing.

1865
02:02:00.52 --> 02:02:11.52
Yeah, it's, it definitely was a hard thing to, to overcome the, the, the, the, the version.

1866
02:02:11.52 --> 02:02:12.52
Yeah.

1867
02:02:12.52 --> 02:02:17.52
Yeah, to broadcasting yourself, which is something that, you know, that I talked about with Tim Ferris,

1868
02:02:17.52 --> 02:02:23.52
and I talked about it with Joe Rogan, is this idea of people that are talking.

1869
02:02:23.52 --> 02:02:24.52
Yeah.

1870
02:02:24.52 --> 02:02:31.52
And, you know, you look at the extreme examples of social media, you know, abusers abusers and worthlessness,

1871
02:02:31.52 --> 02:02:36.52
you know, and, and you just don't want to have anything to do with them.

1872
02:02:36.52 --> 02:02:37.52
Yeah.

1873
02:02:37.52 --> 02:02:41.52
And when you're, when you're doing it, regardless of how much you don't want to have anything to do with them,

1874
02:02:41.52 --> 02:02:44.52
you have something to do with them because you're doing it, too.

1875
02:02:44.52 --> 02:02:46.52
And it's very difficult for me not to feel like that.

1876
02:02:46.52 --> 02:02:48.52
Now obviously, I've gotten over it.

1877
02:02:48.52 --> 02:02:52.52
I mean, I've gotten over it to a point where I'm saying, okay,

1878
02:02:52.52 --> 02:02:59.52
these are kind of the acceptable parameters that I operate within for my personality, you know,

1879
02:02:59.52 --> 02:03:03.52
which is, there's things that I haven't done.

1880
02:03:03.52 --> 02:03:10.52
And I won't do on social media, you know, because I'm not there to promote me.

1881
02:03:10.52 --> 02:03:11.52
Yeah.

1882
02:03:11.52 --> 02:03:23.52
But I'm there to only open a door of observation, I would say, not to knock on people's door and enter,

1883
02:03:23.52 --> 02:03:30.52
but just to open the door of observation and say, this is how I try to live.

1884
02:03:30.52 --> 02:03:38.52
And this is the steps that I take to try and live that way, observe.

1885
02:03:38.52 --> 02:03:44.52
And if you want to enter my house and hang out with me, come on in as long as you're like mine,

1886
02:03:44.52 --> 02:03:49.52
and you have the same sort of goals that come on in and you know what, you're going to make me stronger.

1887
02:03:49.52 --> 02:03:51.52
You're going to bolster me up.

1888
02:03:51.52 --> 02:03:57.52
You're ice, so many people now, they're posting pictures of their watches on my Twitter.

1889
02:03:57.52 --> 02:04:01.52
When I wake up, I'm looking at 50 to 100 watches every day.

1890
02:04:01.52 --> 02:04:02.52
Yeah, man.

1891
02:04:02.52 --> 02:04:04.52
And I'm going, wow, that's a lot of people.

1892
02:04:04.52 --> 02:04:08.52
And that is unity and that is leadership.

1893
02:04:08.52 --> 02:04:12.52
And it does make me feel like, okay, cool, there's other people in the world that are up and

1894
02:04:12.52 --> 02:04:13.52
get NAFTA.

1895
02:04:13.52 --> 02:04:15.52
Yeah, there's a guy who's 20.

1896
02:04:15.52 --> 02:04:20.52
Yeah, and there's a guy who's a teacher posts good.

1897
02:04:20.52 --> 02:04:24.52
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, post a good on the classroom door.

1898
02:04:24.52 --> 02:04:25.52
Yeah, on this classroom door, man.

1899
02:04:25.52 --> 02:04:32.52
And so now he's, yeah, I'm kind of pushing that, those good messages to the kids, you know.

1900
02:04:32.52 --> 02:04:35.52
Yeah, so yeah, I mean, it's all, I think it's all positive.

1901
02:04:35.52 --> 02:04:42.52
Social media, it is easy to get to get that attitude towards it because of all the people who

1902
02:04:42.52 --> 02:04:43.52
abuse it, right?

1903
02:04:43.52 --> 02:04:44.52
Right.

1904
02:04:44.52 --> 02:04:48.52
But, you know, like if you went, I don't know, like on the highway and all you saw was people

1905
02:04:48.52 --> 02:04:53.52
speeding reckless driving and still didn't change a fact that you still want to drive on the highway

1906
02:04:53.52 --> 02:04:55.52
because you have something to do, you know.

1907
02:04:55.52 --> 02:04:59.52
Your, your pursuit is different, but yeah, there's going to be everyone.

1908
02:04:59.52 --> 02:05:06.52
The other weird things I have no idea where this is going, you know, and so like this podcast,

1909
02:05:06.52 --> 02:05:08.52
I didn't, you know, we just kind of did it.

1910
02:05:08.52 --> 02:05:11.52
I went on with Tim Ferriss and just kind of did it.

1911
02:05:11.52 --> 02:05:12.52
I started Twitter.

1912
02:05:12.52 --> 02:05:15.52
I had no idea what that was going to be.

1913
02:05:15.52 --> 02:05:16.52
Yeah.

1914
02:05:16.52 --> 02:05:22.52
And so it's fun for me to be adventuring into things that I don't know the outcome of.

1915
02:05:22.52 --> 02:05:23.52
Yeah.

1916
02:05:23.52 --> 02:05:24.52
And this is one of them.

1917
02:05:24.52 --> 02:05:25.52
And Twitter is one of them.

1918
02:05:25.52 --> 02:05:30.52
The book was one of them and, you know, I don't know what's around the corner next.

1919
02:05:30.52 --> 02:05:38.52
And I don't know where this is going, but I will stay with the principles that I believe in

1920
02:05:38.52 --> 02:05:40.52
to the best of my ability.

1921
02:05:40.52 --> 02:05:43.52
And I think that's what makes it an interesting ride.

1922
02:05:43.52 --> 02:05:45.52
Where's that going to go?

1923
02:05:45.52 --> 02:05:46.52
Yeah.

1924
02:05:46.52 --> 02:05:47.52
We'll find out.

1925
02:05:47.52 --> 02:05:48.52
Okay.

1926
02:05:48.52 --> 02:05:49.52
Last question.

1927
02:05:49.52 --> 02:05:56.52
Joko, what motivates you?

1928
02:05:56.52 --> 02:05:59.52
I heard you mention the man in the cave.

1929
02:05:59.52 --> 02:06:01.52
Can you go deeper on this?

1930
02:06:01.52 --> 02:06:04.52
What motivates me?

1931
02:06:04.52 --> 02:06:07.52
Well, I've talked about this before.

1932
02:06:07.52 --> 02:06:13.52
And it's kind of what we were talking about a couple of minutes ago as well.

1933
02:06:13.52 --> 02:06:24.52
And that is first of all, with the man in the cave and this idea and the thought of the enemy.

1934
02:06:24.52 --> 02:06:32.52
And that was a thought that used to drive me and kind of haunt me and make me get up early

1935
02:06:32.52 --> 02:06:42.52
and work hard to push myself because I knew that somewhere out there there wasn't enemies.

1936
02:06:42.52 --> 02:06:50.52
There wasn't enemy, a real enemy, a real man, a person, a human.

1937
02:06:50.52 --> 02:06:52.52
That was waiting for me.

1938
02:06:52.52 --> 02:06:55.52
And that was preparing for me.

1939
02:06:55.52 --> 02:07:02.52
And therefore, I needed to prepare for him.

1940
02:07:02.52 --> 02:07:03.52
I needed to be ready.

1941
02:07:03.52 --> 02:07:06.52
I needed to be the things I always talk about.

1942
02:07:06.52 --> 02:07:11.52
I needed to be stronger and faster and smarter and better.

1943
02:07:11.52 --> 02:07:24.52
So that when we did me on the battlefield, I would be ready for that rendezvous for that meeting,

1944
02:07:24.52 --> 02:07:30.52
that fate, that battle.

1945
02:07:30.52 --> 02:07:39.52
And that thought, that thought of the enemy, yes, it absolutely fueled me.

1946
02:07:39.52 --> 02:07:49.52
And when I was a leader in the seal teams and charge of men, it was even more profound.

1947
02:07:49.52 --> 02:07:54.52
Because I was thinking about that rendezvous.

1948
02:07:54.52 --> 02:08:00.52
For everybody that I led, everyone else in charge of everyone that I trained.

1949
02:08:00.52 --> 02:08:06.52
And I felt that burden, the burden of responsibility,

1950
02:08:06.52 --> 02:08:25.52
to prepare those men and protect those men, those frog men, those warriors, my brothers.

1951
02:08:25.52 --> 02:08:35.52
And it was my burden to train those guys and prepare them.

1952
02:08:35.52 --> 02:08:43.52
And that burden, it made me a little bit crazy, a little bit paranoid,

1953
02:08:43.52 --> 02:08:49.52
a little bit over the top.

1954
02:08:49.52 --> 02:09:04.52
But I didn't really know any other way.

1955
02:09:04.52 --> 02:09:19.52
And so now, I am no longer a combat leader.

1956
02:09:19.52 --> 02:09:26.52
I no longer prepare men for war.

1957
02:09:26.52 --> 02:09:40.52
So the drive and the motivation is from a different place.

1958
02:09:40.52 --> 02:09:46.52
It's from a solemn place.

1959
02:09:46.52 --> 02:09:58.52
And now I have now, and the motivation now is not really from the enemy anymore.

1960
02:09:58.52 --> 02:10:05.52
Now it's from my friends, my brothers.

1961
02:10:05.52 --> 02:10:21.52
And from those seals that I knew,

1962
02:10:21.52 --> 02:10:35.52
and that I cared about more than anything,

1963
02:10:35.52 --> 02:10:49.52
and that they sacrificed everything for us and for me,

1964
02:10:49.52 --> 02:11:05.52
those guys, they gave their lives for us.

1965
02:11:05.52 --> 02:11:21.52
And now I cannot help but think and remember that every breath that we take is a gift.

1966
02:11:21.52 --> 02:11:28.52
It's a sacred gift from those men.

1967
02:11:28.52 --> 02:11:43.52
Every day we have, every sunrise, every thought, and every smile, and every laugh, it's a gift.

1968
02:11:43.52 --> 02:11:54.52
And I will treasure that gift, that gift of life.

1969
02:11:54.52 --> 02:12:02.52
And I will not let it go to waste, not one second of it.

1970
02:12:02.52 --> 02:12:10.52
And I'll cherish every moment of it, and I will live it.

1971
02:12:10.52 --> 02:12:21.52
I will live it in their memory.

1972
02:12:21.52 --> 02:12:37.52
And in their honor.

1973
02:12:37.52 --> 02:12:48.52
I think that's about it for tonight.

1974
02:12:48.52 --> 02:12:57.52
So, as always, thank you for listening.

1975
02:12:57.52 --> 02:13:00.52
Thanks for subscribing.

1976
02:13:00.52 --> 02:13:01.52
Thanks for reviewing.

1977
02:13:01.52 --> 02:13:06.52
Thanks for supporting.

1978
02:13:06.52 --> 02:13:17.52
And thanks for taking a moment to remember the brave men and women

1979
02:13:17.52 --> 02:13:23.52
that have fought and died for our freedoms.

1980
02:13:23.52 --> 02:13:35.52
And in their memory, make sure you get out there and you get after it.

1981
02:13:35.52 --> 02:13:50.52
Until next time, this is Echo and Jockel. Out.
