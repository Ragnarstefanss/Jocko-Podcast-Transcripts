One I think my street smart's growing up in Detroit you know and being able to talk to the lingo and look the part you know and life unfortunately a lot of times when you first go in a situation especially criminals they're going to size you up they're going to say this this individual look like they know what they're doing can I trust this person you know but a lot of times these people that are working for us they're risking their life and they have to feel confident that you're going to do your best to protect them and I also learned never promise somebody something you can't deliver you know don't promise them well you know you work a couple weeks and you get a couple you know I can make all your charges go away it's not up it's not up to the agents you know you have to bring their cooperation attention to the prosecutor which then brings it to the judge and you know those decisions are made then and also treat people like a people a person you know you don't have to start you know indeed so you end up going on deployment to Afghanistan your first deployment how's that it's some intense every time we go to Afghanistan things are a little different and at the time we were doing a lot of work with the Army ODA's the Green Braise there and at this particular time we were operating in Panjoe area you know the Panjoe of Canada area is kind of the first place of Taliban where there's a lot of in search and activity but also a lot of heroin production going on there also so they broke us up into like two z's and three z's input us with different units and a good partner of mine friend of mine Travis Brooks and myself we were assigned with first special forces group over there ODA 1231 and they were stationed in Cancemins this little little base outside of Canada Airfield which is like our main bases that can't be had our airfield in Afghanistan we were living with the ODA the first group guys you know and we would bring like I said earlier our expertise investigations and we had our partner force over there which we were mentoring and we were living over there with the Green Braise and using our intel information you know from the DEA and also using the military information and we would try to pair that information find out where the bigger drug labs were where they were selling the chemicals and equipment to manufacture heroin and we would not go after is the opion farmers the Poppy farmers because a lot of times they were made to grow the opion you know the Taliban came in and they had the biggest stick at the time either you know you're growing this Poppy force or you're can killed you know so a lot of the individuals who sold and made money out of the effedrant in pseudo-fedron were middle eastern individuals so of course you know they were like you know you know get all your middle eastern informants and see if they have any terrorist activity and we had a lot DEA had a lot of middle eating you know with the drugs in the pseudo-fedron so FBI then wanted to come over started to brief in our informants you know about terror it terrorist related activities within a much of a connection there was a more than just trying to make money there was some you know there was some you know somewhere you know sending money back and things like that so that and also you know I talk about mindset you know you have to have this mindset that if you're in a fight for your life or you're with a suspect or an enemy you're fighting for your life or getting in a shootout or it could be you could be at home you could have an accident or drive a car if you're in a fight you have to survive you have to fight you have to hit claw scratch god whatever you have to do you have to think yourself I am not going to lose this fight I am not going to lose I'm going to survive I'm going to make it through that you have to have that mental attitude you know I kind of call it the warriors mindset or the winning mentality that I'm going to survive and make it through this you know there's no way I'm not going to make it through even though at first I was not unconscious my body my mind didn't give up you're going to you're going to make it through this show you know I didn't see any bright light or anything I may have saw a little fire below or something it wasn't it wasn't time so also talking to the doctors I was in really great physical shape when I got shot and the better shape you're in a lot of times the more traumatic injury you can survive and a lot of times the better your recovery is you know so they get there as for free and you know they're cooking in these houses with these little kids you know and everything is off-gassing into the you know into the air getting into the carpet and walls and everything else so we started bringing child protective services with us when we would do meth and fedamine lab warrants and they would bring the kids to the hospital and when they would test them you know high percentage of what test positive for meth and fedamine just because the staff you know was in the carpet and the atmosphere you know it just breaks my heart you know me having a daughter you know these little kids involved and then not only would they get charged with the meth lab and manufacturing they would get charged with child abuse from CPS also so you would do these investigations you're you're getting human intelligence that's telling you so you know we'll keep going that I do my motivational speaking which gives me purpose now you know we've been you know took jobs and different things we're to serve people and serve the community I can't do my job the way I have in the past but for me to get up there and talk to people and tell my story one is therapeutic for me too to talk about it and two if somebody's having a bad day a bad year or bad whatever that the sea there's always somebody that has it worse it always could be worse so you know you got to count the blessings you have and be thankful for the things that you still have you can't cry about what you don't have anymore all you can just do is move on so you know I'm gonna continue doing the motivational speaking which is good you know and when you go through there they're telling you what you're getting into you know this is what you're getting into and this unit is not for everybody and just because it may not be for you it doesn't mean that you're a bad agent that you can't do your normal job but this is what you're getting into and it's a whole that's a total volunteer unit so you get people that are going through slacking you're just getting your dick knocked into dirt and you know and if it was just you know you did you every day you did like a tier one event you'd be fine but you're also getting hazed in between you know and carrying the logs and the inflatable boats and you know doing crossfit workouts and you know you're 39 years old you're not getting much sleep but they're feeding you so you know we had several tasks in this mission you know the fine drug you know the eradicate some of the drug activity going on and also find these dishgoss so the rainders went in there before us and they got in a pretty good dust up and tick stands for troops in contact and they lost a couple of Rangers so we were going in a couple of days after and you're doing your pre-mission briefing and you know we're gonna get inserted with you know three CH47 and four CH47 helicopters and there's a high probability we're gonna lose a helicopter on infill with the dish goes and you know you're sitting in the night before you you know they think they're slick and they're gonna play both sides and do they get caught they go to prison you know some get killed you know they get found out you know we do everything we can to protect their identity and some do it for a while or some are you know trying to help their legal situation or a family member situation or just doing it for money and you know eventually move on and get on with their lives and get back into some normalcy of life you know but you know being you know having a good informant you're kind of like you know they're they're confident you know there's therapist everything else you know you're phone's gonna be ringing in middle of the night you're always going to want to talk to you you know because it's girlfriend left the left home you know you know be willing to do those things and you know on 52 years old now you can't let these young guys beat you she got to keep yourself in shape you know it was working you know work overseas you know with the special ops guys and like how old are you 41 is it okay and we didn't have a kind of tactical team that was up to speed to do this at the time years prior to that we had an operation called operations snow cap where we were in Columbia and other cocaine manufacturing destinations and hitting Coca-labs you know with you know partner forces in this and that so DEA had to start up a team so they used some of the individuals that we were working snow cap and developed this fast team this foreign deployed advisory and support team to help the military and mentor our partner force over there because we really don't have over there you know any like criminal authority so in the Afghans they were behind the time so we went over you know the military you know they got plenty of trigger pullers and of course we can pull triggers too so so you're wearing plain clothes plain clothes you got like a badge around the neck and the chain you know like TV and the pair jeans you want to look as unintimulating as possible if you want to look intimidating like what's your what's your like what's your character what character you're going into just kind of this kind of low key intimidating enough with you know you're you know federal law enforcement you know you're not playing around yes it's in it was in in Quantico Virginia inside the Quantico military base and when I went through us in the FBI shared the same academy we since have our own academy that's right next to the FBI academy but we still share the gun ranges and driving track in gym with the FBI and how long is that pipeline you know it's like um like 16 18 week academy and what are you doing is it legal is it physical is it what are you doing it's a little bit of everything um where the police academy was more paramilitary DEA was more gentleman academy you know you didn't have to line up for inspection every day I see a speck will win down your you know you're uniform and getting you know the front lean and rest position and all that jazz um but it was very intense very academically challenging very physically challenge challenging we did a lot of shooting a lot of tactical training a lot of scenarios I was very impressed with it the biggest thing was your way from your family for four months as opposed when I went to the Detroit police academy he wasn't an overnight thing you come and go and stuff that's what I would do and um their SQT was going through there at the time and um so it was a full house there how was that training it was intense you know it was you know three weeks day and night of you know getting you know kicked in the balls you know and you know this is what I was told in the seal pre-deployment workup that's usually the hardest pre-deployment block of the toughest you know those those Rangers that we would bring out their just outstanding guys because we as seals always want to have an open mind and make sure that we are understanding the tactics the techniques the procedures of other units what do they know better than us what can they teach us what can we've learned from them and that's one of the ways that we've always done that is taking individuals from other units and bringing them to our units especially to our instructor cadre so that we can learn more and try and get better and those those Rangers that work with us were just outstanding guys and I say and I feel you guys do an outstanding job of your guys as training you know like you said you know knowing that hey there's always you know there's more than one way to skin a cat but you're going to overseas fight in the war so you're using weapons and weapons systems the average DEA agent doesn't never use in their career you know you're using you know belt-fed crew surf weapons you know grenade launchers you know handheld mortars Carl Gustav rockets you know laws you know kind of crap So the training you had worked 100% you know I didn't even think you know I didn't even don't even remember looking through my sights I know I did you know you get that perceptual narrowing you know when you're in a fighter flight or a gunfight you know either eyesight increases you're hearing decreases you start so you fight motor skills so you felt all that stuff and they're partner force probably you would be around 30 you know and fast um because we were like two season three zes have a two to four fast agents and we would bring our partner force at this particular time like we could cherry pick people that were the better um fighters and um sometimes two to four we would take out and did be honest like I said we worked the best in brightest not a high percentage of them were good fighters and a lot of times they weren't in great shape so we're kind of limited what you can do how long of an infill and ex-fill you can do and how complicated a plan you could do so you know it kind of hamstringed us a little bit you know and they decide they're going to stick a nasal fair and gill airway up my nose and in training we have to insert these in any other and just sort of a nose this is like a it's basically like a you shaped tube that you cram and someone's nose that will open up the airway between your nostrils and like your lungs not all the way down your lungs but like through your head you know they're probably what do you think they are Joe like maybe five inches long total something like that and one end looks like there's a funnel on there and the other and you know in training we can put light a cane in our nose before we do it I had you know the belt you know down the feed tray cover shot you know you know the weapon cock bag but the safety on you know ready ready to go you know and they would beat up like they would pick up minorities and jump him like five on one kind of like a one percent or motorcycle gang thing and they put me in there to buy steroids from these kids so I ended up buying steroids from these kids and then later led to Sammy the bull getting to additional legal problems well where is he out right now I'm not sure we's at the moment that's crazy when you're doing these undercover ones that you're talking about are you staying under cover for a long period of time or you basically going under cover for two hours to go meet these guys buy some shit and then roll out did you ever do these guys it seems like they're going under cover for extended period of time that's called like a deep cover operation those don't happen that much anymore you know there's a lot of risk involved then there you know and you know working with the specialized special ops units if you had to work with them before and you can probably know this there's a lot of Dick measuring going out check it's like who are you what can you do if they never work with you you know you know we weren't a special option it for say you know we're the best at DEA have so I kind of knew when I was getting into and Detroit on the police department is kind of a bat tip of my fire you get to learn how to be the real police real fast you know it's kind of sink or swim and you immediately just go right out being like a beat cop in the streets and where with they did is they took the top people out of our class and put us in this unit called tactical service section we were a citywide unit that did crowd control also if there was a bearer-fated gun person we would do outer perimeter and we would work in areas where they were having problems certain precincts or the precincts got overrun with calls and we would go in flood the area and help the precincts out so it was kind of like a QRF like a quick reaction for us kind of like that in a way you know huh you know it's crazy you know you know these drugs are crazy especially these harder drugs like as you kind of said he controls their whole life you know and most of the labs are smaller we call them mom and pop labs are cooking ounces that's cute you know and you see you went into over 500 meth labs in how many years was that four years and four years so that's like you know up hitting a meth lab every two or three maybe four days going into those things did you feel like hey they're we're making a dent or sometimes you just feel like we're just overwhelmed and this is we could keep doing this forever it got to the point where it was bad for a while you almost felt overwhelmed but there was so many and it was so easy to get the precursor chemicals to manufacture a meth infetamine here in the United States so then we started as a whole DEA we started cracking down into the companies that made the a federal tablets or the pseudo-fedron pills which is one of the primary precursor chemicals of meth infetamine and would track where their shipping in made him harder to get and that's why you probably see like if you buy any coal medication that has pseudo-fedron you got to buy it you have to get it from behind the counter now right this people were going in just you know buy in two stealing tool two boxes they wanted that real pure glass 98 99 you know percent pure meth infetamine which was homegrown made and then once the we you know cracked down the precursors in harder to get here Mexico started picking up their game and started making the real pure meth infetamine down in Mexico and sending it up through the border so that means you were dealing with the cartel the big drug cartels um yes a lot and especially when I worked in Phoenix you know course that's what is you know the Southwest is controlled by the Mexican drug cartels um do you have any you know big memorable operations or that you did that you were part of? You know I forgot to ask you this when you got in that shooting back when you're with the Detroit what did you have any lessons learned from that about the way it happened about what you what how your reaction was did you do something well did you do something bad did you feel like you're training work did you feel like your training didn't work like how how was that experience that yes that's a very good question with all the training we had you know the different scenarios and differentiated gun people I just reacted with my training you know I saw the muzzle fly as I knew it was gunfire and you know your place do you know do you know do they know your order already do you order the same thing all the time yes for your whole family everyone's getting everything like everyone's getting the same you're the case the Charles residents we need our food sign goes variable literally like you're I see your face but you get a score higher rock marches you know with weight on you you're doing a certain time a distance run you know all these different thinking and you know kind of thinking on your feet and leadership different tasks and things and you actually have to we use actually use this company that they before a lot of people in the military go to different special options they have to take this test online which is kind of like a psychological and like an IQ test and you got to answer these questions and there's different schools like the read school and everything I never went to a formal school most of that I got was on the job training you know I got what some you know agents and some local police that were good at it and just picked up and learned you know hey this seems to work this doesn't work you know so you know it was a good experience you know you get to get the bond with those you know the people you play with and you learn life lessons and actually in college you know you finally get to do think you know classes that you're interested in your major and some of the listeners you know that the Afghans they use these icon radios to talk with each other and we intercept these things you know a lot times they're just talking shit on these damn things you know we're killing them you know the marriage they're dying know and you know when the military first went over to Afghanistan you know we had some intel we didn't know you know all the you know Ben Laden had his trained facilities over there but when the US military went over there they shortly realized that the Taliban in those and surgeon groups were making their money for their legal territories by the sale and reduction of heroin and that's one of the first questions I get why is DEA I was DEA over in Afghanistan but you know there's things and treatments and things you can do for that like the Stelegangly and Block Shot is one a great thing for that you know finding a good fit with a therapist you know that you know can work with you so all those things important so to me I tell people it's my show to say you have it hey you know you know informants you know summer will try to work off charge a summer just paid informants and they go around and that's what they do you know so-and-so is manufacturing meth here you know so then of course we're all you know people who grew to the TV then the second plane hit and they're like this is not a small plane and you know of course all the chaos and everything that went on that day I ended up going to the gym and you know work you know I was made to you I'm not when I'm going I'm going that rope better be in the right spot because I'm going to be at the bottom of it in about two seconds and that's that it is funny when we were doing our fast rope training at little creek and the towers and everything you know you serve the tower at first and you do your appelling and everything it you know it just take your time sit down you know and the helicopter you know and then grab the rope and slowly spin yourself just take your time what about doing all these you know doing all these hits over the years with the DA down in the Phoenix area you know you you obviously are starting to pack away some good some good you know methodologies and and thought processes as you're going to do these things like all your big takeaways as you you as you developed as of you know as a agent I always was very tactically proficient but I tell you you got to learn how to do you know land warfare drills very effectively you got to get to know how to use your equipment your night vision your lasers very well you came out of their well prepared like you know knowing that something happens in combat you know so we were the first ones that go out of the bird and I don't know if it's worse being able to see or not you know we jumped out of a king air you know the open that door and that wind's just rushing you know where the first they tell you what to do you know so when I talk to groups you know especially military law enforcement groups you know I tell people you don't have to be Olympic athlete but please please please be in the best shape you can because it may save your life you never know like I said it could be a car accident in your end or you could fall over ladder at the house you know just please stay in the best shape that you can so we fly back to the base tearing count which we're staying at with the Aussies so we land at so we ended up using her and going back and they kept coming to town but of course they moved their operation to another spot and then we were able to investigate and look at all these other seizures that happened in different states and tie them all together to these people you know interviewing actually interviewing the truck drivers got their sources to supply you know pulled receipts from hotels and and plain things at different time when they were supposed to do these deals and were able to tie everything together and some of these people we had never caught them red handed with drugs but just what testimony by the informants putting the things together by pulling receipts we ended up hammering this group and getting them all charged and indicted when a lot of these other groups couldn't do it and I actually helped my partner get her GS13 because at DEA are kind of journeyman levels GS13 and you have to do so many things you know you have to have these complicated cases and or dinner wire tap or did some undercover so I actually helped him get her 13 I got it you know what are you guys doing you know we're training working with some of the best units in the world world you know we're doing things what you would think DEA would be doing you know we're doing this high level stuff and at the time every year they would put out a solicitation for solid first to go through the fast selection and you need it to be at least a GS12 so that usually takes about three to four years to get to a GS level 12 he's you know they're doing this you know there you know you thinking about making a bad you know you need dance or little calls and a lot of people don't like to do that and when I was a de agent and a police officer you know I didn't gauge my success on how many people I arrested and this and that I gauge my success on how many people did I help they get their life together you know just be as a person you know gets caught up in drugs or some crime activities it doesn't necessarily mean they're a bad person you know they made some bad decisions so I gauge my success mostly and hey how many people this year did I help? like well you know he had to fill just you know fill out this questionnaire you know I've been on the job you know this many years and this is kind of the background of things I did on a job
