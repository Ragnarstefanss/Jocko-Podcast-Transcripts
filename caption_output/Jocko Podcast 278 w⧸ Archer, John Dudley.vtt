00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockelpond cast number 278 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It's a little cold outside, but it doesn't matter.

3
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Nothing else matters right now, except doing my job right.

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This job.

5
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I take another step as gently as I can, as quietly as I can.

6
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This is where it all matters.

7
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I can't let them hear me. If they do, they'll be gone.

8
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Then I won't get my shot.

9
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I take another quiet step. I see my buddy freeze.

10
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
He sees them.

11
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
They must be in range.

12
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
My buddy slowly looks back at me and gives me a nod.

13
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It's go time.

14
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I prepare my weapon.

15
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
By now, I know this weapon well,

16
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I've shot thousands of rounds through it in the last year for this moment.

17
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Ever since I was a little kid, it's been this way.

18
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Stocking through the woods, closing the distance, trying to see without being seen.

19
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:09.000
My adult life was much of the same sneaking around in the woods or in the desert or in the city or in the jungle.

20
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I take a few more steps and find some cover by a tree. This will keep me hidden.

21
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
My buddy gives me a hand signal. He's given me the range.

22
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Nothing else matters. I initiate the procedures.

23
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
My mind is full, but it's empty. My heart is beating, but it's steady. It all comes down to this moment.

24
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'm alive.

25
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Now that may have sounded like a combat scenario,

26
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
but it wasn't. It was a description of a more recent pursuit of mine.

27
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Everybody jeÅ¼eli.

28
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I'm miserable.

29
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I got taken in just a single region.

30
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
potent recovery, a recent public recovery.

31
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Madame Marianne, president of California,

32
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:36.000
a friend that is always ready to help. Not just me, but an entire community of people. The world

33
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:45.52
renowned founder of knock-on-artry, John Dudley. Dud? What's up, man? Thanks for coming on.

34
00:03:45.52 --> 00:03:55.28
It's a story. That was awesome. It was a fire, right? Yeah, especially this season where we were

35
00:03:55.28 --> 00:04:01.36
on a lot of bowls and that happened that little thing played out time and time and time.

36
00:04:01.36 --> 00:04:05.84
Time and time again. I ended up not getting any shots off, but man. It was freaking fun.

37
00:04:08.40 --> 00:04:13.12
All right, man. Let's go. There's a lot of people that really don't know much about you.

38
00:04:13.12 --> 00:04:21.52
And let's go back to the beginning because I have heard peace together stories of your life.

39
00:04:21.52 --> 00:04:26.48
And there's a lot of good ones, man. It's always surprising that you're here. You

40
00:04:26.48 --> 00:04:31.12
weren't arrested. You're not prison. You're not dead. You know, there's a lot of different

41
00:04:31.12 --> 00:04:35.92
men. Yeah. Abonus, you could have headed down. Dang, right? Yeah. Just a horrible.

42
00:04:37.12 --> 00:04:42.24
I don't deserve my wife or my son. Just like all the time. I'm just like karma.

43
00:04:43.36 --> 00:04:49.76
Like he's that real patient sniper. And at some point, like I don't think he's made any fire yet.

44
00:04:49.76 --> 00:04:55.60
If he has, they've been off so much. I haven't heard him come by, but like I'm still waiting

45
00:04:55.60 --> 00:05:01.20
just to get sniped because I deserve it if it happened. All right. So where were you born?

46
00:05:02.24 --> 00:05:08.96
Fort Bragg. Cud your dad was an army. Yep. Yep. And is that where you did you spend any time in

47
00:05:08.96 --> 00:05:12.32
Fort Bragg? Do you remember if you spent any time in Fort Bragg? I don't remember it. No, I don't

48
00:05:12.32 --> 00:05:20.56
remember it because it was it was 76 and then I think by 77 we were in the Mississippi Delta.

49
00:05:20.56 --> 00:05:25.68
Was he still in the army? No, I think he just got out. And then what was what he

50
00:05:25.68 --> 00:05:32.64
did want to get out of the army? He was a he was pretty much like Bill Murray. He was a groundskeeper

51
00:05:32.64 --> 00:05:38.08
for a golf course while he went to college after getting out of nom. You know, came back and

52
00:05:38.08 --> 00:05:44.40
really was like, he was like a hundred percent like freaking scope and out gofers and wait,

53
00:05:44.40 --> 00:05:51.68
this is Caddy Shack Bill Murray. Yeah, we are always. Okay. Yeah, I remember I remember like

54
00:05:51.68 --> 00:05:58.32
being with him in that golf cart cruising around and he went to and this is stuff I haven't

55
00:05:58.32 --> 00:06:02.96
even talked to him about. This is just from memory from that long ago, but I'm sure he went to

56
00:06:02.96 --> 00:06:08.80
Delta State and Cleveland, Mississippi. My mom worked for Baxter Health Care and that's why I

57
00:06:08.80 --> 00:06:16.96
think we were there and so my dad went to college for psychology and you know, I remember

58
00:06:16.96 --> 00:06:23.28
plug-in, and learn into plug holes on the golf greens and smoke in that first ball washer with

59
00:06:23.28 --> 00:06:28.32
the golf cart when I was, I don't even know how old I was. I just know like, you know, my dad

60
00:06:28.32 --> 00:06:33.28
being like, bring that golf cart over here and it was in reverse. I just stomped on and just drove over

61
00:06:33.28 --> 00:06:37.20
the ball washer. Yeah, the first time karma made a little. That's the first time karma saw me

62
00:06:37.20 --> 00:06:42.32
going away the second and retracting on this nerd. Yeah, I mean, I wonder what my dad would think,

63
00:06:43.92 --> 00:06:51.76
you know, damn, is that a sign? That would have been a real easy one to get to get over. Yeah,

64
00:06:51.76 --> 00:07:00.000
because it just, I was a tornado for a while. Wait, so where'd you do like the bulk of your,

65
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.80
like when you were in, let's say like six, seven to eight, when you start actually, you know,

66
00:07:04.80 --> 00:07:12.96
figuring out the world and all that, where are you then? It would have been Illinois. We were in the

67
00:07:12.96 --> 00:07:18.96
Delta until I was seven, I think, and then my mom got transferred up to Northern Illinois

68
00:07:18.96 --> 00:07:27.68
to work for Baxter and that's kind of where I grew up. And when I came up there, honestly, I was

69
00:07:27.68 --> 00:07:34.40
a little bit rebellious. Not really sure why. I just, I don't know, it's just what I was into,

70
00:07:34.40 --> 00:07:43.36
like I was a skater and honestly, there was, I enjoy skating, I enjoyed like freaking ninja movies

71
00:07:43.36 --> 00:07:52.64
and so I, like, I built ramps and you know, and people and I was just like a punk and Northern

72
00:07:52.64 --> 00:07:57.52
Illinois, that, you know, when, when everything was like skater died and there was, you know, all these,

73
00:07:57.52 --> 00:08:06.72
like anti-scape things, that was me. So yeah, school, you know, there was definitely a little bit of,

74
00:08:06.72 --> 00:08:15.28
you know, hate towards skating then and I wasn't like, I had no drive athletically. I was just

75
00:08:15.28 --> 00:08:23.76
wanting to like pierce my ears, like play with fireworks, you know, blow stuff up.

76
00:08:25.36 --> 00:08:27.68
I think it's around. This is how old built.

77
00:08:27.68 --> 00:08:37.84
Eight to 13, it was just like, you know, my first construction job I said was building ramps.

78
00:08:37.84 --> 00:08:43.84
I mean, I had ramps all over the place. My sister freaking hated them. How good? How good

79
00:08:43.84 --> 00:08:51.36
it's skating where you? I would say I was just below intermediate.

80
00:08:51.36 --> 00:08:58.56
Is it something where you, how many hours a day were you skating? Like a lot. Yeah, I had

81
00:08:59.20 --> 00:09:04.56
half by, of course, what's up with the stellar level of just below intermediate? Because I

82
00:09:05.44 --> 00:09:10.80
the only instruction I had was watching the search for animal chin freaking every day, like

83
00:09:11.44 --> 00:09:17.84
in a big box of cereal and then go out and just try to get after it. So what, at what point

84
00:09:17.84 --> 00:09:25.44
or what was it that made you start doing athletics sports? You teen me up for this? So

85
00:09:26.32 --> 00:09:31.84
I think I was doing some weird stuff. Yeah, because my dad was, I always knew my dad was a

86
00:09:31.84 --> 00:09:38.64
super athlete. You know, he was my uncle and me on my mom always told me how athletic my dad was.

87
00:09:39.52 --> 00:09:47.28
And not to mention, he was just good at, you know, anything like, honestly even the skateboard,

88
00:09:47.28 --> 00:09:51.92
he's just like, what's that? And I learned to skate on this half pipe and he's just like,

89
00:09:51.92 --> 00:09:56.24
oh, let me check it out and then he just do it. You're just over your drive. He had a ball of

90
00:09:56.24 --> 00:10:08.48
all. But no, I like I said, I liked fireworks and like, you know, blowing stuff up and, you know,

91
00:10:09.20 --> 00:10:14.64
one thing led to another and freaking burn my house down at 10 years old.

92
00:10:14.64 --> 00:10:21.44
It's over 11 maybe 11. Maybe 11. Literally. Yeah. Yeah. Everything except for what was in my

93
00:10:21.44 --> 00:10:26.88
dad's car while he was at work and what was in my mom's car while she was, I think in Puerto Rico

94
00:10:26.88 --> 00:10:31.92
on a business trip. How old were you? I think I was like 11 or 12. How did it happen?

95
00:10:32.64 --> 00:10:39.84
Playing with fire, freaking lit some stuff on my bed on fire and then like put it out,

96
00:10:39.84 --> 00:10:44.96
called my dad and my dad, you know, he's like, do you get it out? I said, yeah, I got it out and he

97
00:10:44.96 --> 00:10:49.04
goes, is there smoke in the house? I go, oh yeah, there's freaking tons of smoke and he's like,

98
00:10:49.04 --> 00:10:53.52
open up all the windows. He said, you know, he's like, I hate the smell smoke. You know, get that

99
00:10:53.52 --> 00:10:58.64
shit out of there. So I opened up everything and he's like, go open up the windows and everything

100
00:10:58.64 --> 00:11:02.96
come back and tell me what's going on. So I came back to the phone. I'm like, I open up everything.

101
00:11:02.96 --> 00:11:09.28
It's smoke in, but smoke's going out. So he talked to me for a little bit and then he said,

102
00:11:09.28 --> 00:11:13.36
we'll go check on it, go back down and check on it and I went down when I went down. It was like

103
00:11:13.36 --> 00:11:20.16
in golf because I just gave it oxygen. You know, I didn't, like, if I would have just, like,

104
00:11:20.16 --> 00:11:24.96
taken that blanket and like, you know, if he would have just said, go throw that blanket out in the

105
00:11:24.96 --> 00:11:32.08
yard, like, game over. But, you know, I put it out and then freaking fueled, like, open the front door,

106
00:11:32.08 --> 00:11:37.20
open the window and just freaking gave that thing. What were you burning? Like, like, matchsticks,

107
00:11:37.20 --> 00:11:42.88
were you burning like what? I think I was just playing flame thrower with a lighter and some

108
00:11:42.88 --> 00:11:54.96
aqua net that has just been mad. And so, so the whole house burns down. Oh yeah, everything.

109
00:11:54.96 --> 00:12:02.56
Yeah, everything. And so it was, I mean, I don't really know what kind of conversation my parents had

110
00:12:02.56 --> 00:12:09.68
because they never, they kind of asked what happened or something, you know, but they never,

111
00:12:10.48 --> 00:12:17.04
like, made me feel horrible about it. And then they just let, I mean, you must have felt like freaking

112
00:12:17.04 --> 00:12:22.40
horrible though. Oh, still do. I mean, I laugh about it now. But yeah, like, I think about, you know,

113
00:12:23.20 --> 00:12:30.24
because like, all my dads, you know, all my dad's military stuff, like, every picture he had from,

114
00:12:30.24 --> 00:12:37.36
you know, as a child, you know, everything we had, every single thing. I remember it was in the

115
00:12:37.36 --> 00:12:43.20
winner. So everything like froze, like after they put it out. And I remember digging through it with

116
00:12:43.20 --> 00:12:48.16
my dad, you know, we were like digging through the thing, like a couple days later, just trying to

117
00:12:48.16 --> 00:12:54.32
see what you can find. And I remember we like, we were digging and found this, like, closet that was

118
00:12:54.32 --> 00:13:00.16
in right inside our front door and it like fallen through and the, like, the glass doors were there.

119
00:13:00.16 --> 00:13:05.68
And I remember my dad, you know, shuck in the glass doors open and he had a pair of these, like,

120
00:13:05.68 --> 00:13:12.96
lacrosse, winner boots and they looked a brand new and I'll never forget how excited. He's just like,

121
00:13:12.96 --> 00:13:18.96
my boots, man. Be freaking grabbed him. He's just like, my boots are okay. And I remember, like,

122
00:13:18.96 --> 00:13:23.52
that was it. Like, other than what he had in his, the trunk of his car and what he wore to that

123
00:13:23.52 --> 00:13:34.16
day, like that was it. So then we, you know, started to rebuild naturally. I was a skater and not to mention

124
00:13:36.16 --> 00:13:45.20
10 years old. I was five foot, 130 pounds. So I was like short and fat, you know, short and

125
00:13:45.20 --> 00:13:53.20
chubby. And so, you know, short and chubby skater, you know, wasn't an athlete. So then, you know, my dad could tell

126
00:13:53.20 --> 00:14:00.16
I was, I was bummed out, you know. And so he kept telling me, like, you need to go, just go do something,

127
00:14:00.16 --> 00:14:04.40
you know, just, you know, go get active, hang out with your friends, like, you know, he wasn't

128
00:14:04.40 --> 00:14:09.20
want me to like sit around and get depressed about it. So they talked me into going out to, like,

129
00:14:09.20 --> 00:14:15.76
a school dancer or something. You know, this is whatever fifth grade or something. I remember going

130
00:14:15.76 --> 00:14:23.76
and they said, like, this, hey, the songs dedicated to John Dudley and it was burning down the house.

131
00:14:23.76 --> 00:14:30.80
So I wanted to put on a kid's drink. Some jocco over there said that one, my one.

132
00:14:31.84 --> 00:14:37.36
That's, I was, fortunately, that's exactly what, that's exactly my mode. What I was a kid to be a

133
00:14:37.36 --> 00:14:46.24
little freaking savage. Yeah. So then that's amazing. That your parents recognized that you felt

134
00:14:46.24 --> 00:14:52.40
enough guilt on your own without having to just turn the screws on your brain to make you feel even

135
00:14:52.40 --> 00:14:56.40
worse about it. Yeah. I don't know if I could have done it. Like, I don't know. I don't know what

136
00:14:56.40 --> 00:15:01.36
the conversation was. They've never brought it up. And there's been times where we've talked about

137
00:15:01.36 --> 00:15:07.36
the fire. It's kind of how it's referred to. But they've never gone into detail. Like, my dad's

138
00:15:07.36 --> 00:15:12.48
never said, like, yeah, man, I knew if I freaking threw that shit on you, you know, it cracked you or

139
00:15:12.48 --> 00:15:19.44
whatever. But what happened was, you know, and me, oh, maybe this is just my dad psychology. But

140
00:15:20.72 --> 00:15:27.36
what happened was after that dance, my dad knew, like, we need to get this guy out of this town.

141
00:15:27.36 --> 00:15:34.48
So we moved about 45 minutes away. And without him ever telling like, saying anything to me,

142
00:15:34.48 --> 00:15:43.84
I knew when I moved. Like, I need, I need to freaking make it right with my dad. So that's when

143
00:15:43.84 --> 00:15:50.24
I went and started. But I'm just like, you know, he's, I know he's always wanted to be me to be an athlete.

144
00:15:50.24 --> 00:15:55.36
So like, I need to get my shit together and start getting into sports. And this is how, how will

145
00:15:55.36 --> 00:16:00.72
you? I think I was, because you keep saying like 10 12 10 12. Well, there's a bigger thing.

146
00:16:00.72 --> 00:16:08.16
10 10 10 10. Yeah, I think the, I think the fire was when I was 10. And then we probably moved when I was 11.

147
00:16:09.04 --> 00:16:14.40
Yeah, because then by when I got into junior high school, that's when I'm like, I'm going to be an athlete.

148
00:16:15.52 --> 00:16:20.24
What did it start with? What was the first sport? Basketball.

149
00:16:20.24 --> 00:16:30.56
Um, well, yeah, I think basketball football. There's all in. Yeah. Basketball football running. And then,

150
00:16:30.56 --> 00:16:35.36
you know, there was, I knew you had no experience playing basketball. That's it.

151
00:16:35.36 --> 00:16:39.52
My dad always shot hoops. That's what I mean. It's not a little bit of a little bit. Yeah, a little bit.

152
00:16:39.52 --> 00:16:45.28
But then I started growing. So I was like, I remember at 10, I've got this football card.

153
00:16:45.28 --> 00:16:51.44
And it says like, it has your stats on the back. And I think my grandma gave me that photo,

154
00:16:51.44 --> 00:16:58.80
because we didn't have any pictures, you know, going back pre-fire. So I was like 5 foot 130 pounds.

155
00:16:58.80 --> 00:17:07.68
And I was like, Chubby. Then when I was a freshman, so what is that 13 12 12 13 13 year

156
00:17:07.68 --> 00:17:16.24
freshman I think? So then on that, on that one, I was 6 330. And then by the time I was senior, I was 65

157
00:17:16.88 --> 00:17:26.32
205. So I just like stretched out and just looked like this gumby going up and down the basketball

158
00:17:26.32 --> 00:17:31.28
court, you know, my dad's like, I always felt like if you tripped it sound like a chandelier break

159
00:17:31.28 --> 00:17:38.000
and a crossing. How much would you practice like, okay, so you get into basketball, the

160
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.40
you start saying, because I mean, that's that's a for you to make a transition from like, hey,

161
00:17:42.40 --> 00:17:47.44
I'm a skater with freaking whatever you probably had like the Tony Hawk bangs and stuff like this.

162
00:17:49.84 --> 00:17:54.88
Hell yeah. So you had the Tony Hawk bangs. Then you're like, all right, maybe a basketball player.

163
00:17:54.88 --> 00:17:59.76
You get a crew cut. You start freaking training. Is it like that kind of, we talking rocky?

164
00:17:59.76 --> 00:18:05.68
What's that thing called montage? Is there a montage going on? No, not really, because I still,

165
00:18:05.68 --> 00:18:14.88
I mean, I still liked, you know, getting in trouble and freaking blowing stuff up and, you know,

166
00:18:14.88 --> 00:18:21.52
order and fireworks wherever I could or egg in some houses or, you know, whatever kind of this

167
00:18:21.52 --> 00:18:28.80
shift. I stole my mom's minivan one time. She had this, she had this Pontiac transport.

168
00:18:28.80 --> 00:18:34.56
You remember those ones? It was like a wedge. It just sloped. Yeah, because eventually my parents got

169
00:18:34.56 --> 00:18:39.60
divorced and I can't remember when it was. It was somewhere, you know, junior high or something like that.

170
00:18:39.60 --> 00:18:48.64
But my mom traveled a lot and I was home on my own a lot. And so I remember, you know, my mom would

171
00:18:48.64 --> 00:18:55.04
have like cars take her to O'Hare. And so I remember one time, like, I'm just going to go take that

172
00:18:55.04 --> 00:19:01.68
van out for rip, you know, like, all the ball washers in, you know, all the email and all I

173
00:19:01.68 --> 00:19:08.56
would do is I'm driving by. Yeah. So I'm driving around, you know, seventh grade, just driving around

174
00:19:08.56 --> 00:19:14.72
my town and this minivan and one of my buddies was on his bike like driving out the road.

175
00:19:14.72 --> 00:19:20.08
So I pull over and I'm like, what's up, man? He's just like, holy shit. Did you steal a car?

176
00:19:20.08 --> 00:19:26.64
I'm like, yeah, it's my mom. And he's just like, and, you know, and I thought I could drive pretty

177
00:19:26.64 --> 00:19:33.04
decent because I had my dad would never let me get like motorcycle or anything for obvious reasons.

178
00:19:33.60 --> 00:19:39.36
But he let me get a boat. He got me a 12 foot boss and wailer with a 25 horse on it.

179
00:19:39.36 --> 00:19:46.96
Okay. So that's like, I put a thousand miles on that freaking thing, dude. I mean, my dad would

180
00:19:46.96 --> 00:19:54.72
fill up that little five-gann, five-gann gas can and the Fox River chain was only a block from

181
00:19:54.72 --> 00:20:00.64
my house. We live like right on a channel. So I just drove that boat all the time. So to me, the minivan

182
00:20:00.64 --> 00:20:09.04
was gravy, right? No current. You know, didn't have trim til, like this was, it wasn't a pull start.

183
00:20:09.04 --> 00:20:17.44
This was freaking gravy. But I'm sitting there talking to this, this kid and I see someone coming

184
00:20:17.44 --> 00:20:21.84
up behind me in the mirror. So I said, I go, hold on. I'll let me freaking with over, you know,

185
00:20:21.84 --> 00:20:28.56
and I've been written reverse and trying to like do a little, you know, whip in. But that long

186
00:20:28.56 --> 00:20:34.40
beak on the front of that freaking minivan, I ended up swiping this dudes like back pegs and like

187
00:20:34.40 --> 00:20:39.12
took him out underneath like the front of the car and like bent the back of his bike up a lot.

188
00:20:40.16 --> 00:20:46.16
So then I ended up having a, you know, trade him like my good bike at a GT, you know, I had to trade

189
00:20:46.16 --> 00:20:52.88
him like a good freaking, it was good bike for a huffie. Yeah, for this freaking huffie that he had.

190
00:20:52.88 --> 00:20:57.28
And and I'm just like, you're not going to say nothing. He said no, but, you know, looking back,

191
00:20:57.28 --> 00:21:05.12
you know, if any of our kids rolled in with a brand new freaking GT, you know, with the gyro on it,

192
00:21:05.12 --> 00:21:12.48
freaking pegs on the front back, you'd be like, hey, who's bike did you steal? So anyway, you know,

193
00:21:12.48 --> 00:21:20.48
fast for today, I'm knocked out. Always. Holy crap. The kid broke bro. He broke big time.

194
00:21:20.48 --> 00:21:24.48
The desk went out to go to a blind. They could, they could, they could be at me.

195
00:21:24.48 --> 00:21:30.80
drove home in the car. Yeah, it was just, you know, stuff like that. Yeah, Ben, you hear like, wait,

196
00:21:30.80 --> 00:21:35.60
job, dubbie, dad. Little kid was driving his mom's car. I'm going over to the right now. Yeah.

197
00:21:36.64 --> 00:21:42.64
I don't think anyone wanted to get close because, yeah, I mean, I had, I had freaking

198
00:21:42.64 --> 00:21:51.44
straight bangs down here, slung it. And yeah, just, I think, I think when I got into sport,

199
00:21:51.44 --> 00:21:56.48
they're, and originally, I didn't want to really play football. I was supposed to play golf.

200
00:21:57.12 --> 00:22:03.04
Like, my dad said, don't play football. You're not, you know, you're too brittle. Go play golf.

201
00:22:03.04 --> 00:22:08.48
And when I went to the high school, like the tough kid in school came up to me and goes,

202
00:22:09.60 --> 00:22:14.48
hey, what are you going out for? Because I was standing in the line. And he said, I go,

203
00:22:14.48 --> 00:22:18.24
I'm going out for golf. He's like, no, you're going out for football. And I said, no, I'm going out for

204
00:22:18.24 --> 00:22:25.84
golf. I have to do golf. And I remember he said, well, we need enough guys to scrimmage. And he said,

205
00:22:25.84 --> 00:22:31.20
you know, I'm quarterback. So he's like, you're signing up for football or I'm going to beat your

206
00:22:31.20 --> 00:22:36.16
ass. So I freaking signed up for football. I'm never told my dad for, like,

207
00:22:36.16 --> 00:22:41.20
until he saw me in the paper. What do you, what do you see in the paper for? Well, because I ended

208
00:22:41.20 --> 00:22:47.28
up becoming quarterback and like, taking that kid's job. So how was he was saying, I would take my golf

209
00:22:47.28 --> 00:22:53.36
clubs to school? Because I'd say like, he's like, how's golf? And I'm, it's all right.

210
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.20
But I was playing football because I kind of had to. And I started out as like defensive in and then

211
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.96
tight end. And then I think I like chucked a football back. You know, I think I caught a pass and like

212
00:23:06.96 --> 00:23:12.16
went in the end zone. And then the coach was like, hey, throw the ball back. And I think I just freaking

213
00:23:12.16 --> 00:23:18.80
just hooked it. And he just like, whoa, you know, wait a minute. So he had just one thing led to another.

214
00:23:18.80 --> 00:23:29.44
And just I think I think I loved, I don't know, just the concept challenge. It's hard to

215
00:23:29.44 --> 00:23:36.64
describe. But it's like, if I know I'm not good at something, which I really had never fueled that,

216
00:23:36.64 --> 00:23:43.60
then it didn't keep me coming. Like, I'd get bored with it. But if I, if I wasn't good at it,

217
00:23:43.60 --> 00:23:49.68
or if I knew that I had room for improvement, then that's the things that I progressed at. But it just

218
00:23:49.68 --> 00:23:54.64
kind of got to the point where no matter really what the sport was, I felt like I could do it above

219
00:23:54.64 --> 00:24:02.72
average. And then I honestly like my body started to change. So it went from like me being like the

220
00:24:02.72 --> 00:24:11.92
short fat skater to now I'm, you know, second tallest kid in the school and growing and, you know,

221
00:24:11.92 --> 00:24:17.92
becoming an asshole, you know, just kind of being, you're just growing up just being like overly

222
00:24:17.92 --> 00:24:26.24
confident, you know. But I felt, I just felt so much confidence. It was like gas. Just sports for me.

223
00:24:26.24 --> 00:24:32.000
Was just gas. Because it's like, oh, you want to do track? Okay, go do track. What did you do in

224
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:43.04
track? Um, high jump, triple jump. Whatever I wanted. Honestly, 100, 200, 400 and you just go to the

225
00:24:43.04 --> 00:24:50.80
all of them. Yeah, I mean, I did for my team. Yeah, I did good. Did you, did the coaches like try and keep

226
00:24:50.80 --> 00:24:57.44
you focused on one thing? I think, yeah, like the idea that some people have that the best thing to

227
00:24:57.44 --> 00:25:00.88
do with their kid is put them in one sport when they're four years old. Yeah, that's keep them

228
00:25:00.88 --> 00:25:06.48
focused on. And then other people are like, hey, have your kids play a bunch of different sports

229
00:25:06.48 --> 00:25:12.48
and it's going to make them more well rounded in the end. Well, it's, in a way, you look at it like

230
00:25:12.48 --> 00:25:18.08
functional fitness now. It's proven that, you know, if I would have had more functional fitness

231
00:25:18.08 --> 00:25:25.28
in my lifestyle, I would be feeling a little bit better today than I did pre-surf. You know,

232
00:25:25.28 --> 00:25:30.56
for the first time with you, um, because like some of my stuff is smoked, probably because it's not

233
00:25:30.56 --> 00:25:37.28
like functional fitness. And I'm, I'm a, you know, I feel like the reason I still today do good.

234
00:25:37.28 --> 00:25:43.92
It just random things I pick up is because, you know, when you do different sports, you also get

235
00:25:43.92 --> 00:25:48.72
street smarts in athletics. You know, that's the thing, like there's booksmart people and then

236
00:25:48.72 --> 00:25:55.84
there's street smarts people. And as like an employer, I, you know, I'm not, I don't look for

237
00:25:55.84 --> 00:26:02.16
degree. I look for work ethic. And I look for someone that, you know, when they pull up and I look

238
00:26:02.16 --> 00:26:09.20
in their car, it's not a freaking wreck. It's not trashed, you know, and I look for people that have

239
00:26:09.20 --> 00:26:15.52
certain types of work ethic qualities. Because for me, as an athlete, I feel like, even though I wasn't

240
00:26:16.88 --> 00:26:23.44
like the pinnacle of all these different sports, I also learned different mechanics and different, like,

241
00:26:23.44 --> 00:26:32.000
you know, physical smarts from doing a lot of things. And I always, I always wanted to do good enough

242
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:39.20
at it to where I felt like I could put it down and pick it up and still like represent it. Well,

243
00:26:39.84 --> 00:26:44.16
you know, if I felt like I, if I did it and looked like an idiot in front of people, I'd want to do it

244
00:26:44.16 --> 00:26:52.24
more until I could get it figured out. But my son, you know, coming from England, he was in the soccer

245
00:26:52.24 --> 00:26:57.84
first. So he came over and, you know, he played soccer quite a bit, but over here, soccer is like a

246
00:26:57.84 --> 00:27:04.56
one season thing. So once he got into junior high, you know, he tried football and I realized that just

247
00:27:04.56 --> 00:27:10.88
wasn't this thing, you know, it just wasn't, you know, getting hit and stuff, just wasn't this thing.

248
00:27:11.44 --> 00:27:18.16
But he was like always fast, you know, he's always fast and, and he likes, I mean, he

249
00:27:18.16 --> 00:27:26.64
performs at his highest if especially when he knows someone's pumped about the fact that he just did good.

250
00:27:27.60 --> 00:27:36.24
So I ended up talking him into swimming because he did, let's see, he did soccer. I knew soccer

251
00:27:36.24 --> 00:27:40.08
was coming up. We talked him into cross country and he didn't really like the people.

252
00:27:40.80 --> 00:27:45.44
Love the coach, awesome coach. And then I talked him into going into swimming, winning the

253
00:27:45.44 --> 00:27:54.96
swimming, had a freaking awesome instructor, military dude, super disciplined, slam like, honestly

254
00:27:54.96 --> 00:28:00.96
for how young he was. I was like, okay, these guys are crazy two days. Like, Charms getting up at

255
00:28:00.96 --> 00:28:10.64
430, having him to the pool at 515, they do an hour practice and then shower and then she'd get

256
00:28:10.64 --> 00:28:16.64
him home to feed him before we take him to junior, you know, whatever high school or whatever. So he had a

257
00:28:16.64 --> 00:28:22.000
pretty like awesome schedule, I thought, you know, I'm like this guy and he was getting straight

258
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:29.28
days, which I don't ever remember taking a book home. Like, I don't even remember being a sign

259
00:28:29.28 --> 00:28:35.04
books. Yeah, part of it was different, I didn't wrong. It was different back then. I mean, like, I didn't

260
00:28:35.04 --> 00:28:40.24
do, like, I see my kids, my kids will have, and they're older now, but when they were in school,

261
00:28:40.24 --> 00:28:47.36
it was like homework every day from day one from like kindergarten on through high school, hours and

262
00:28:47.36 --> 00:28:53.36
hours and hours, the homework. I never did homework. Homework was not a thing. And I, I,

263
00:28:54.80 --> 00:28:59.20
wait, now let me refresh that. It was a thing. It did exist. I knew that it was a thing in

264
00:28:59.20 --> 00:29:04.40
existence, but it wasn't a thing that I was doing right? It wasn't like, oh, it's, you know, it's

265
00:29:04.40 --> 00:29:08.56
the afternoon. I'm gonna do homework now. It was like the afternoon. I'm going to throw rocks at

266
00:29:08.56 --> 00:29:15.04
shit. I guess that was, that was where I was at. So what, what sports did you end up playing?

267
00:29:15.04 --> 00:29:19.68
Because I know, like you rattle off one time to me, you're like, oh, I did freaking wrestling. I did

268
00:29:19.68 --> 00:29:23.52
basketball, I did football, I did baseball, I did tennis, I did freaking, you did everything.

269
00:29:23.52 --> 00:29:32.000
Yeah. Well, you just named them all. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I did, I did quite a bit. I wrestled a year

270
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:39.68
mainly because I did basketball, really didn't like the coach. And just, I'm like, I freaking hate

271
00:29:39.68 --> 00:29:46.32
this guy. So then I went and wrestled and coming into wrestling as a sophomore, and we had a really

272
00:29:46.32 --> 00:29:52.24
good wrestling school too. Like both the Guidas are from. That's right. Yeah, you saw me that.

273
00:29:52.24 --> 00:29:59.12
Yeah. So like Jason was my guard and Clay was a little bit younger, but, you know, we had a

274
00:29:59.12 --> 00:30:05.20
fire up was Clay Guida when he was 14. Dude, dude, dude, he's 30 whatever right now. He's still

275
00:30:05.20 --> 00:30:14.56
fired. Let me just tell you Clay, well, Jason was Jason was like on a clay level, but like more,

276
00:30:15.52 --> 00:30:22.40
like more of a gorilla, you know, Clay gives Jason a lot of credit for being a savage and trust me.

277
00:30:22.40 --> 00:30:30.64
He was every game. He like, before every game, he'd take a mouthpiece out of a packet and we'd

278
00:30:30.64 --> 00:30:38.08
put it on his helmet and then he was like my pulling guard. And I remember like, by fourth quarter,

279
00:30:38.08 --> 00:30:44.08
I'd be like grabbing his mask. I'd normally like grab his face mask to like call plays.

280
00:30:44.48 --> 00:30:50.32
And I'd look and it would just be like the plastic piece like because he would chew just

281
00:30:50.32 --> 00:30:56.40
be eating like a human. He would eat a whole mouthpiece and his eyeballs were like this big around.

282
00:30:56.40 --> 00:31:05.36
Yeah, this is Jason or Clay. Jason, yeah, Jason. And I remember, I remember one time, like him and

283
00:31:05.36 --> 00:31:14.40
him and his brother lived in a part of town that was like, you know, um, I don't know, there's a

284
00:31:14.40 --> 00:31:19.68
lot of savages over that way. You know, there's like a lot of like wrestlers came from that group

285
00:31:19.68 --> 00:31:26.96
town. There's a lot of bad asses over there. And I remember one time like Jason came to practice

286
00:31:26.96 --> 00:31:32.64
and he was kind of pissed because he was like chainsawing something on his garage and the chainsaw

287
00:31:32.64 --> 00:31:38.24
kicked back and hit him in the top of the head and like chainsawed his head open and dude,

288
00:31:38.24 --> 00:31:45.04
he just threw his football helmet on and freaking got after it. Dude, like that right there.

289
00:31:45.04 --> 00:31:53.12
I was just on a on Jason and I wrestled the same the same weight class, which was what I think

290
00:31:53.12 --> 00:32:01.28
171 in our sophomore year, but he was like way better. I was just on Jordan Peterson's podcast

291
00:32:01.28 --> 00:32:04.96
a little while ago and he was like talking to me and I was like talking about how like when you're

292
00:32:04.96 --> 00:32:11.92
a young kid and that's not everybody, but you just want to like fight and go and that's my

293
00:32:11.92 --> 00:32:16.48
picture when you picture him just knowing a part of this freaking mouthpiece and his eyes are all big.

294
00:32:16.48 --> 00:32:20.32
This kid needs to go to combat somewhere like that's what he's meant to do.

295
00:32:20.32 --> 00:32:26.16
And he did. And he did. So you wrestled for a year?

296
00:32:26.16 --> 00:32:29.76
Yeah, wrestled for a year. But it's good to look. I'm okay. How good of an athlete you are?

297
00:32:29.76 --> 00:32:37.20
You roll into wrestling and did you not just get like crushed? Oh yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

298
00:32:37.20 --> 00:32:46.08
You can't catch up. You know, I wrestled. Yeah. I wrestled JV and I mean they were that we were a wrestling

299
00:32:46.08 --> 00:32:52.16
school. Like, you know, we had we had some really good wrestling coaches and

300
00:32:53.52 --> 00:33:00.48
me. Yeah, it was tough. It was tough. But I really I was still like getting into my body honestly

301
00:33:00.48 --> 00:33:06.64
at because I stretched up so high. And so I didn't have a lot of coordination. But I had work ethic.

302
00:33:06.64 --> 00:33:11.44
You know, that's one of the things before like before I go down that route like with

303
00:33:11.44 --> 00:33:18.32
multi-sport thing with my son. He did swimming after cross country and then when he got to soccer.

304
00:33:19.52 --> 00:33:26.32
Like he started the coach wasn't playing it. But at practice this this coach was taken weeks to

305
00:33:26.32 --> 00:33:32.16
try to condition the other player. But here he'd be out there just running circles around people

306
00:33:32.16 --> 00:33:38.56
because he just got off of cross country followed by swim season followed by now at soccer season.

307
00:33:38.56 --> 00:33:44.16
You're just running around on some grass. You know, so he for him it was nothing and I I remember

308
00:33:45.20 --> 00:33:51.76
after like three or four games of watching the coach just bypass him. I kind of pulled the

309
00:33:51.76 --> 00:33:56.88
coach to the side after practice and I said, hey, I said, is there anything I should be working

310
00:33:56.88 --> 00:34:04.32
with Harry on so he can get more game time? And he just said, well, I don't like single player.

311
00:34:05.12 --> 00:34:11.20
You know, he said, I want soccer players. Harry's too distracted with other sports.

312
00:34:12.40 --> 00:34:20.80
And I was just like, really, you know, I said, I'd deal with a lot of coaches

313
00:34:20.80 --> 00:34:30.88
on pretty high levels. And I said, I've never known a coach to not want an athlete on the team.

314
00:34:31.52 --> 00:34:37.04
I'm like, this this kids and athlete and athlete as opposed to a sport specific.

315
00:34:37.04 --> 00:34:44.64
Yeah, I'm trick going triponi. Yeah. And so yeah, right then I just kind of told Harry, like,

316
00:34:44.64 --> 00:34:51.04
I don't think soccer's your thing. So he went into track and, you know, did cross country track and

317
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.12
slam four years, even though he didn't like it, you know, still did it. And then, you know,

318
00:34:57.12 --> 00:35:03.20
ended up going to college to run and and still gets awesome grades and runs and does all that stuff.

319
00:35:03.60 --> 00:35:09.84
And he's kind of like like I was, but a little bit later, he's like now getting into his

320
00:35:09.84 --> 00:35:17.28
into his body to where Andy's also hit a new gear of competitiveness, which is really cool to see,

321
00:35:17.28 --> 00:35:23.36
because I hit that way earlier, you know, I would get probably what held me back athletically as I

322
00:35:23.36 --> 00:35:29.44
would get really pissed off. You know, it's like once I started to compete, I hadn't ever been taught

323
00:35:30.16 --> 00:35:36.64
the management of like, you know, raging out when you, like made a bad play or through an

324
00:35:36.64 --> 00:35:41.60
interception or something. And that that actually transpired all the way into my archery career and then

325
00:35:41.60 --> 00:35:48.88
luckily um, an Olympic coach like helped that. That was a big turning point in my career like in my

326
00:35:48.88 --> 00:35:55.76
20s when I got taught like how to get, you know, how to not let the arrows in my quiver that haven't been

327
00:35:55.76 --> 00:36:01.92
shot yet be affected by the ones that already have and that you can't get back, you know, that's kind of how

328
00:36:01.92 --> 00:36:09.28
it was put to me. So that really helped, but in high school, I think by the time I hit, you know,

329
00:36:09.28 --> 00:36:15.84
junior and senior year, I just started to, I just started to feel way more confident in what I was doing

330
00:36:15.84 --> 00:36:23.44
and, you know, size wise, you know, I was a totally different person than what I was.

331
00:36:23.44 --> 00:36:31.04
So what ended up being like the sport football for sure? Yeah, football was was the sport and for me,

332
00:36:31.76 --> 00:36:37.36
I've always struggled with sleep, you know, I've always just, you know, been in and saw him the

333
00:36:37.36 --> 00:36:44.08
act. And I also, one of the things that kept me awake was knowing if someone else was like

334
00:36:44.08 --> 00:36:52.64
having more time to train than me. So, you know, I was welcomed by world. Yeah, so I was like in high school

335
00:36:53.68 --> 00:36:59.92
by my senior year, you know, I was like substituting any non-elective class that I had or all my

336
00:36:59.92 --> 00:37:07.84
study halls for like, extra gym. So I'd go to like 4 gym classes and then I had my, my football coach gave

337
00:37:07.84 --> 00:37:15.28
me a key to the gymnasium. So when I couldn't sleep at night and my mom would be gone, you know,

338
00:37:15.28 --> 00:37:21.36
I was home, I was home alone a lot, you know, I had my mom would just sign a checkbook for me to like

339
00:37:21.36 --> 00:37:28.88
order Domino's, you know. And whenever I woke up, I'd go to the high school, go in there and I had,

340
00:37:28.88 --> 00:37:33.76
you know, my coach gave me this huge bag of footballs when I was a sophomore and just said like

341
00:37:33.76 --> 00:37:39.76
these are years until you graduate. And so I'd just go to the gym and I'd pull the laundry baskets,

342
00:37:39.76 --> 00:37:45.44
you know, out of the locker rooms. And I'd just throw, you know, from corner to the gym to corner the

343
00:37:45.44 --> 00:37:53.04
gym, I'd just run like three step drills and just like run 73 passes into those or then into garbage

344
00:37:53.04 --> 00:37:58.08
cans or then eventually just like throwing into the basketball hoop and then just doing like three

345
00:37:58.08 --> 00:38:03.92
step drops, five step drops, seven step drops, roll outs and just and then I got to the point where

346
00:38:03.92 --> 00:38:08.64
it's like I memorized what I needed to do but then I memorized what the line we need to do and then

347
00:38:08.64 --> 00:38:14.000
you know, like every player on the field, it's like this is, you know, I knew the playbook front and back.

348
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:22.80
How good would you say? So, how do you guys do senior year? Horrible, you know, just really

349
00:38:22.80 --> 00:38:29.12
underperformed at all the camps, we were awesome because it camps. How should you have done?

350
00:38:29.12 --> 00:38:33.12
I mean, were you from like a week school, a week football school? No. You're from a good football

351
00:38:33.12 --> 00:38:41.36
school and you guys were just playing shitty. No, you know, it's kind of like, it's kind of like when

352
00:38:41.36 --> 00:38:46.16
you, I forget what podcasts it was or maybe it's in your book when you were talking about

353
00:38:46.16 --> 00:38:53.60
three buds, there were the two teams of the two different boats. You know, I remember like one of the

354
00:38:53.60 --> 00:38:58.40
saying, my football coach always would have, he'd be like, you know, bring the boat in, you know,

355
00:38:58.40 --> 00:39:03.68
he always would say like the boats lost, he's like a geor job to bring the boat in, you know,

356
00:39:03.68 --> 00:39:09.36
and he was like, you're job-meaning you, yeah, because you're the quarterback. Yeah, I was responsible

357
00:39:09.36 --> 00:39:14.40
for every mistake we made. You know, if we screwed around and practiced to get shut off early,

358
00:39:14.40 --> 00:39:19.84
he would, he would like pull me back and tell me like, you're going to run laps for

359
00:39:20.80 --> 00:39:25.20
every person here that screwed off today and today there was, you know, we freaking,

360
00:39:25.20 --> 00:39:30.80
46 minutes early, we quit practice. I want 46 laps, you know, it'd be like stuff like that.

361
00:39:31.60 --> 00:39:37.44
But we had a small group of people for like seven on seven camps that were at all the, they were

362
00:39:37.44 --> 00:39:45.36
at all the camps. They, I would call them and say, let's go practice. But there was, and we, at seven

363
00:39:45.36 --> 00:39:53.28
on seven, we were great. But there was, you know, four other people that weren't being included,

364
00:39:53.28 --> 00:40:02.80
and then the entire defense. So we were just, we had really good pieces, but nothing ever, like

365
00:40:02.80 --> 00:40:07.84
flowed as a team. Did you, did you do good enough? Did you get looked at by colleges?

366
00:40:07.84 --> 00:40:13.28
Yeah, I think the first college, I think the first college that looked at me was ball state when I was

367
00:40:13.28 --> 00:40:17.20
a sophomore. I remember at the end of my sophomore year, I went to ball state with my mom,

368
00:40:17.92 --> 00:40:23.04
and that was like that litter totally different fire, because then I realized like, you know,

369
00:40:23.04 --> 00:40:32.80
I'm going to go somewhere. And so, you know, my dad, even though my parents were split,

370
00:40:32.80 --> 00:40:37.92
my dad was at every freaking game. And he was quite a ways, you know, he kind of moved to a different

371
00:40:37.92 --> 00:40:45.12
town. But he came to every game. And yeah, I mean, my life was sport,

372
00:40:45.12 --> 00:40:53.76
sport, and training. I mean, I loved lifting, I camped in the summertime. It was every football

373
00:40:53.76 --> 00:41:01.36
camp I could sign up for. And honestly, my mom's like, you know, she was so, you know, involved with

374
00:41:01.36 --> 00:41:07.12
her position at backster to where she's like, yeah, if you want to, you know, go somewhere for

375
00:41:07.12 --> 00:41:11.36
a month in the summer, do it, you know, because I think she probably just, you know, was

376
00:41:11.36 --> 00:41:17.12
managing plants and Puerto Rico or Singapore or wherever the heck, you know, she was for her

377
00:41:17.12 --> 00:41:25.12
job. So, I just, I did not miss an opportunity to like go to a camp or something like that.

378
00:41:25.12 --> 00:41:28.88
So did you actually get recruited to go in your senior year to go to college?

379
00:41:28.88 --> 00:41:35.60
Yeah, yeah, there was several. And I ended up choosing, I wanted to go back. My dad was moving

380
00:41:35.60 --> 00:41:44.32
back to North Carolina. My uncle was in North Carolina. And one of the coaches at Western Carolina

381
00:41:44.32 --> 00:41:52.16
played with my dad and, you know, we ended up going out there. And it was kind of a decision that I

382
00:41:52.16 --> 00:41:58.08
would be close to the Dudley family, out that way. And I liked the idea of like getting,

383
00:41:58.08 --> 00:42:06.40
honestly, I never really felt like that town was home, you know, and maybe it's because, like,

384
00:42:06.40 --> 00:42:12.96
you know, my parents were kind of always split. I saw my mom limited, you know, when she wasn't

385
00:42:12.96 --> 00:42:18.40
traveling. But we, like, we traveled away from like me and my mom were together more when we go

386
00:42:18.40 --> 00:42:24.72
places. Because she'd say, hey, you know, I've got a, I've got a meeting in Salt Lake for two days.

387
00:42:24.72 --> 00:42:29.76
Do you want to come with me? And I'd say, oh, can I go to, I've been wanting to check out snowbird.

388
00:42:29.76 --> 00:42:34.56
And she's just like, yeah, you know, so we'd fly out there. And she'd say, the bus will pick you up in

389
00:42:34.56 --> 00:42:38.24
the morning and seven and they'll bring you back to, you know, just make sure you're back here.

390
00:42:38.96 --> 00:42:45.60
This time, so I just go up and then I started, you know, skiing, shred and love skiing,

391
00:42:45.60 --> 00:42:52.08
worked at a little ski hill up there and skied bumps, like all the time in the, in the winter time.

392
00:42:52.08 --> 00:43:00.96
And it's cool. So then what happened with college then? So I was going to play football. And

393
00:43:02.16 --> 00:43:08.24
like the one thing that I haven't talked about was back at age 10 when I was a super punk.

394
00:43:11.28 --> 00:43:18.64
My uncle and my grandfather got me into like hunting deer when we'd go down to Mississippi.

395
00:43:18.64 --> 00:43:23.92
We'd go back down there to see family for Thanksgiving. And so, you know, they were like,

396
00:43:23.92 --> 00:43:28.96
you know, we need to get you out in the woods. And my grandpa was all, you know, creating more

397
00:43:28.96 --> 00:43:34.000
veteran. And he's like, you know, we need to make a man of you because I'm showing up with freaking

398
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:41.60
Tony Hawk haircut and freaking earrings and, you know, stuff like stuff like that. So he's out there,

399
00:43:41.60 --> 00:43:47.84
you know, making me sit and firing at beds and, you know, just trying to like make a man out of this

400
00:43:47.84 --> 00:43:55.12
freaking softy that's coming down. And so, you know, like I got into hunting and just loved it.

401
00:43:55.12 --> 00:44:03.12
Like it was, and honestly, probably because it was hard. And it like took a ton of patience and

402
00:44:03.12 --> 00:44:10.24
it was very different from being able to just screw off, you know. And so it was, it was the first

403
00:44:10.24 --> 00:44:17.04
kind of form of competition in a way, just that it took a lot of moving parts to be successful.

404
00:44:17.04 --> 00:44:23.28
So, you know, when I got my first deer, it was like winning my first trophy, right? I mean,

405
00:44:23.28 --> 00:44:29.52
I was totally hooked at how freaking awesome it was. And just seeing my family, like, oh my gosh,

406
00:44:29.52 --> 00:44:34.64
you got a deer, then we ate it and everything, you know, and it was just this thing. So every

407
00:44:34.64 --> 00:44:39.76
year for Thanksgiving, I was looking forward to going back home and doing that. And I got into bow hunting.

408
00:44:39.76 --> 00:44:44.56
I think when I was the first year, I hunted with, they gave me, I had a gun and then

409
00:44:44.56 --> 00:44:54.08
when I was 10, is when I started shooting a bow and bow hunting. So that was once a year, that was

410
00:44:54.08 --> 00:45:01.92
happening. But then I got a little bit better towards the end of my senior year. I was shooting a

411
00:45:01.92 --> 00:45:07.68
lot more around home, like I was practicing and stuff a lot because again, I had a lot of free time.

412
00:45:07.68 --> 00:45:14.32
You know, my mom would be gone. You had no homework. Yeah. No homework. If I wasn't like

413
00:45:14.32 --> 00:45:21.44
cutting grass, like, you know, through five bucks a long, then that's what I was doing. But I ended up

414
00:45:23.52 --> 00:45:28.96
driving down this road. I actually had to hurt my knee. So I was, I was, I moved in a college a

415
00:45:28.96 --> 00:45:38.08
little bit early. And hurt my knee. And then I forget what happened. But I was at home, back by my

416
00:45:38.08 --> 00:45:45.76
mom's for some reason. I was just driving around on this like a back road. And I think I was coming,

417
00:45:45.76 --> 00:45:51.52
I think I went to college. Yeah, I was moved in. I moved in and I'm talking like, there a week,

418
00:45:52.24 --> 00:45:59.36
maybe a week and a half. And you can hurt your knee at some point. Yeah. It's not really able to play.

419
00:45:59.36 --> 00:46:04.56
Yeah. I thought whatever reason you go back home. Yeah. We did some, we did some like run throughs.

420
00:46:04.56 --> 00:46:10.48
I know I did some stuff with like, you know, I remember wearing like pants, jersey helmet,

421
00:46:10.48 --> 00:46:17.12
you know, just doing like dry runs and stuff. But I wasn't, I don't, I never like hit really hit

422
00:46:17.12 --> 00:46:24.72
helmets, you know, in college. And so as the weekend, I went back and saw my mom. And then I drove,

423
00:46:25.28 --> 00:46:29.68
I think I went up to the ski hill just to, you know, go up there and say how to people that

424
00:46:29.68 --> 00:46:35.52
worked up in the summer. And on my way back, I took some back roads back home. And I went by this

425
00:46:35.52 --> 00:46:41.28
little town called Ringwood. And I saw this sign on the, on the side of the road that just said,

426
00:46:41.28 --> 00:46:47.12
archery shoot like spray painted on a board and just had an arrow like pointing that way.

427
00:46:48.64 --> 00:46:51.60
So I went down that road and I'm like, what's this all about, you know,

428
00:46:52.32 --> 00:46:56.72
yeah, I had my heart. I went down this road. Yes, you did. Yeah. Yes, you did.

429
00:46:56.72 --> 00:47:02.16
Well, went down the road. And I said, what's this all about? And they're like, oh, we got a, you know,

430
00:47:02.16 --> 00:47:07.60
40 target course. And you know, here's how the scoring works on the animal, you know, 3D animal

431
00:47:07.60 --> 00:47:13.36
targets. I had never seen 3D animal targets. I'd always like shot it, bail's a hay and stuff like that.

432
00:47:14.24 --> 00:47:23.12
So I went out and freaking halfway through the course. I was out of arrows. I had freaking

433
00:47:23.12 --> 00:47:31.28
shot the woods down. And I remember leaving the course got my car went back up to Wilmont,

434
00:47:31.28 --> 00:47:36.64
Wisconsin, which was where the ski hill was, but there's also a Gander Mountain outlet store there,

435
00:47:37.28 --> 00:47:44.24
went in and bought more arrows like in a rage and went back to finish. Because I didn't want to

436
00:47:44.24 --> 00:47:49.92
not finish the course. So I bought more arrows to go back to finish by the time I'd like finished

437
00:47:49.92 --> 00:47:55.12
everything was pretty much done. And they were having the award ceremony and the guys that were

438
00:47:55.12 --> 00:48:03.76
up on that podium all had these shirts that had like their local shop on the shirt. So I remember

439
00:48:03.76 --> 00:48:10.64
this was on a Sunday and on Monday morning, like when they, I think they opened it one o'clock,

440
00:48:10.64 --> 00:48:16.80
but at one o'clock, I was at that shop. Just like, when are those guys coming in that, you know,

441
00:48:16.80 --> 00:48:23.20
one this weekend and I just started staying in there and watching these people shoot and ask

442
00:48:23.20 --> 00:48:31.92
questions and I was there a few days just kind of being a stalker. And the owner of the archery shop

443
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.64
called me to the side said, hey kid, what are you, what are you doing? I said, I'm just, I'm watching.

444
00:48:38.64 --> 00:48:44.72
I'm watching. And he said, well, come in the back room. I need you for a minute. He took me in the

445
00:48:44.72 --> 00:48:49.28
back room and he said, I forgot to get this guy's arrows done. He goes to be overbuilt arrows and

446
00:48:49.28 --> 00:48:56.72
I said, no, sir. He goes, okay, well, here's how you do it. And he said, you know, you're going to

447
00:48:56.72 --> 00:49:01.12
clean this feather like this. Then you're going to put the glue on it. You put it in this clamp and

448
00:49:01.12 --> 00:49:06.72
then you stick it down. And he's like, you know, set this timer and then move on to this next jig

449
00:49:06.72 --> 00:49:10.64
and do a second arrow. And then when you get to the six, you can go back to the first. If the

450
00:49:10.64 --> 00:49:17.44
timer's gone off, you rotate it. And so I just sat in this room and flesh this guy's arrows.

451
00:49:17.44 --> 00:49:24.32
And then kind of came out and said, like, I got off, you know. So he came out and gave the guy's arrows.

452
00:49:26.32 --> 00:49:33.04
The guy just said, all right, do those ones. And he had just this buckets of arrows that

453
00:49:33.04 --> 00:49:37.36
needed to get done. So I just started flesh and arrows. And then the next day's like,

454
00:49:37.36 --> 00:49:41.76
give you ever worked on a bow and I said, no, I haven't. And he's like, all right, well, let me show you

455
00:49:41.76 --> 00:49:46.48
how to change a string and, you know, and then he's like, hey, if you know, if these bows are here

456
00:49:46.48 --> 00:49:51.76
for maintenance, you know, here's the checklist. You got to, you know, clean these axles. You got a wax

457
00:49:51.76 --> 00:49:58.96
is stringing and melted in with this and just started showing me. And honestly, after probably

458
00:49:58.96 --> 00:50:06.96
two weeks of doing that, I ended up telling the guy, I said, hey, am I going to get a page

459
00:50:06.96 --> 00:50:13.36
change? And he's just like, I remember the guy's name was Mike Donovan, some people in the

460
00:50:13.36 --> 00:50:19.20
archery industry, like old timers. They still remember him because he was a pretty hard core

461
00:50:19.20 --> 00:50:25.04
archery manager at the time. But he goes, you can't put value on what I'm teaching you right now.

462
00:50:25.04 --> 00:50:32.56
I remember, I'm like, no sir, you can't, but I can't put gas in my tank, you know, with experience.

463
00:50:32.56 --> 00:50:39.76
So he, he's like, I'll give you a four, 10 an hour and I'm just like, oh, yeah, you know, I was

464
00:50:39.76 --> 00:50:47.20
freaking pumped. And I remember going home to my dad and I went to my dad's a North Carolina

465
00:50:47.20 --> 00:50:53.12
or what? Well, my dad at that time, I think was, yeah, he was still in Rockford, Illinois. And I

466
00:50:53.12 --> 00:51:05.36
remember telling my dad, hey, I'm not going to go to college to play ball because I've, you know,

467
00:51:05.36 --> 00:51:11.12
I've got this archery thing going and it's, it's because it's good. He's like, you know, like,

468
00:51:11.12 --> 00:51:18.000
that four, 10 an hour I did. Because I remember, you know, again, he's always been super logical

469
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:25.28
and he's also like tried to not, he never really told me like, at that point he had never said like,

470
00:51:25.28 --> 00:51:31.36
what's wrong with you or, you know, that's a terrible decision. But in that instance, he's like,

471
00:51:31.36 --> 00:51:37.84
I, I really feel like you need to make your own decisions and you need to know like what to do.

472
00:51:38.56 --> 00:51:45.12
He said, but I have to say, I think this is a terrible decision.

473
00:51:45.12 --> 00:51:52.40
And I think for my 40th birthday, he wrote me this really long birthday card in like, in there,

474
00:51:52.40 --> 00:52:00.56
he said he's like, you could have not done a better job of proving me wrong. Because he's like,

475
00:52:00.56 --> 00:52:07.84
he goes, he goes, I can't believe, I can't believe what you've done in like 22 years type thing,

476
00:52:07.84 --> 00:52:14.16
you know. Hey, what, when you went to that 3D shoot for the first time on the, on the side of the

477
00:52:14.16 --> 00:52:20.88
road or whatever, what do you think it, what feeling did you have, what was it that just freaking was like,

478
00:52:20.88 --> 00:52:28.24
this is it. Uh, yeah, like I listened to Ted Nugent on Rogan and like he gave some crazy

479
00:52:28.24 --> 00:52:32.80
description of like launching an arrow. It's all poetic and everything. Yeah. What did, is that what you,

480
00:52:32.80 --> 00:52:42.80
you were just like, no, never had that for me, it was, I couldn't like the fact that I knew

481
00:52:42.80 --> 00:52:49.52
that that was that showed me how inferior I was with a bow and arrow and I loved hunting.

482
00:52:50.16 --> 00:52:56.64
And it showed me that there was every person that was in that parking lot was a lot better than me,

483
00:52:56.64 --> 00:53:04.56
and that was a problem. And, and that 100% was, you know, I had to go to the shop, I had to learn,

484
00:53:05.28 --> 00:53:10.64
and then it's like, I'm not gonna leave until I beat these guys. These guys that are winning,

485
00:53:10.64 --> 00:53:17.28
like, I need to beat them. And then once I did that, it was, you know, I remember I, I did really well,

486
00:53:18.64 --> 00:53:26.80
did well fast, and I remember going to a shoot that was about 45 minutes away to the north,

487
00:53:26.80 --> 00:53:32.08
and I remember going in there, my name was like written down on a piece of paper that was like

488
00:53:32.08 --> 00:53:38.64
at this registration desk. And these are rinky-dinks like local shoots, you know? I don't know if like,

489
00:53:38.64 --> 00:53:46.96
you have like local surf tournaments where it's not like, yeah, yeah. So, I just said, oh, what's up with

490
00:53:46.96 --> 00:53:53.36
that name you got right there, and they're like, oh, uh, this guy is supposed to be a serious cheater,

491
00:53:53.36 --> 00:54:01.52
so when he comes, we're gonna send someone out with him. And I go, oh, well that's me, who's coming.

492
00:54:03.12 --> 00:54:06.80
And wait, so they were thinking this because you had been doing well in the downturn?

493
00:54:06.80 --> 00:54:11.84
Because I kind of came from nowhere, so these, these people that, that was their thing,

494
00:54:13.28 --> 00:54:17.60
they're just like, where did this guy come from? Who, who even is he? You know, they'd never

495
00:54:17.60 --> 00:54:24.24
seen me even at a local club, you know, because I was just nothing, and then when as I always do,

496
00:54:24.80 --> 00:54:30.56
you know, oh, I'm not good at this, then just like headfirst into the deep in like,

497
00:54:30.56 --> 00:54:34.56
how many shoot narrows at night, waking up in the morning, shoot narrows, like, you just fall on,

498
00:54:34.56 --> 00:54:45.84
fall on the session immediately. Yeah. Yeah, like, you know, had to, like sat around after tournaments

499
00:54:45.84 --> 00:54:52.000
and would like take down courses for places if they'd give me a target, so I'd have another

500
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:59.52
target, you know, or, you know, I would freaking cut grass or clean the bottoms of people's boats,

501
00:54:59.52 --> 00:55:03.84
or whatever, so I could buy another target, and then, you know, I had to have an entire range

502
00:55:03.84 --> 00:55:09.92
to practice on, and then it just, you know, and then I wanted like a colored target bow, and then it just,

503
00:55:10.16 --> 00:55:15.68
it's just like, it's me, it's just me, it's who I am all the time, it just, you know, I had to like,

504
00:55:16.32 --> 00:55:22.96
I had to get good at it, but then there came a point where, um, and actually at that tournament was kind of

505
00:55:22.96 --> 00:55:29.04
a turning point because this is the cheater one. Yeah, so I went out, did I end up winning that

506
00:55:29.04 --> 00:55:36.000
tournament and they had someone like writing score, and I said, um, I go, well, that was kind of nice,

507
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:41.36
just having someone else keep score. I'm like, hopefully keep score for these other guys that have

508
00:55:41.36 --> 00:55:46.88
a problem, you know, because it's called like pencil pushing, you know, and they just said, well,

509
00:55:46.88 --> 00:55:50.80
if you don't want to deal with that, you could always go to Nationals where there's two score

510
00:55:50.80 --> 00:55:57.60
keepers, and so I'm just like, where's that? So then I went to the National Triple Crown and

511
00:55:57.60 --> 00:56:05.92
slept in the back of my truck and, you know, shot at that and sucked at it horribly, but then the next

512
00:56:05.92 --> 00:56:13.12
year, you know, I instead of going like two, I went to all of them, drove to all of them, and just got

513
00:56:13.12 --> 00:56:19.92
better and got better, and then within like five years, I was at a level that was, you know,

514
00:56:19.92 --> 00:56:28.16
that I was happy with, but I was also still refining it, you know, just there's, that's what's

515
00:56:28.16 --> 00:56:34.72
cool about archery is, I think the reason I'm still doing it is because, you know, I still find,

516
00:56:36.08 --> 00:56:41.36
if I'm not centered, then it shows, so it's hard, like, you're never going to have a perfect

517
00:56:41.36 --> 00:56:47.36
game to where you can just back away and know that like, okay, that was a Cinderella story I've done,

518
00:56:47.36 --> 00:56:54.88
because you can go have a perfect round, but then in an hour later, I've seen you have to shoot another

519
00:56:54.88 --> 00:57:05.28
one, yeah, yep, yep, how do you cheat in archery? Well, I mean, there's just, there's groups where,

520
00:57:05.28 --> 00:57:11.04
you know, at like a local tournament, they're not going to send a scorekeeper out, so let's just say,

521
00:57:11.04 --> 00:57:16.80
like, we all went out with our wife. There's definitely people that, you know, they would shoot down

522
00:57:16.80 --> 00:57:21.60
their in score like an eight, but they just like write a 10. I mean, while like the wives and kids are

523
00:57:21.60 --> 00:57:27.84
just like not giving a crap about what's going on, but then you just turn in your score card and, you know,

524
00:57:27.84 --> 00:57:35.92
this, but once you get into like the professional events, there's two people that keep score,

525
00:57:35.92 --> 00:57:43.92
the majority of the group has to agree on the arrow call, and then if there's ever a divide,

526
00:57:43.92 --> 00:57:49.44
then you call an official scorekeeper to come and call it, which is kind of a big reason why I liked

527
00:57:50.08 --> 00:57:57.12
progressing, because once I was shooting like internationally, you know, they had like,

528
00:57:57.12 --> 00:58:01.76
you couldn't even have an arrow judge that was from your country, so if you, you know, it's like

529
00:58:01.76 --> 00:58:08.40
if an American needed an arrow call, someone would come over like an official judge from another

530
00:58:08.40 --> 00:58:12.64
country would come over because obviously now there's teams competing against teams, so,

531
00:58:12.64 --> 00:58:19.84
you know, these judges had schooling on how to call an arrow and stuff like that. So how does that

532
00:58:19.84 --> 00:58:25.20
go? Like, you know, I enter the tournament and then what, I just shoot on at my own pace, kind of thing,

533
00:58:25.20 --> 00:58:30.08
and keep my own score. I think what might be confusing you, I go is like the first tournament

534
00:58:30.08 --> 00:58:35.92
that he's talking about are just like kind of like local, just going to be like, just going to

535
00:58:35.92 --> 00:58:42.24
be a festival. It's like going to like a little jiu-jitsu tournament somewhere and there's not like judges.

536
00:58:42.24 --> 00:58:46.72
You know what I'm saying? Where a jiu-jitsu tournament, like when you have like, I've

537
00:58:46.72 --> 00:58:52.32
victory, I have an in-house jiu-jitsu tournament, there's no like escalating the call that the point

538
00:58:52.32 --> 00:58:56.16
keep, you know, your tech, hey man, you lost whatever you did good, someone could be like, oh yeah,

539
00:58:56.16 --> 00:59:00.64
you know, you're not getting points on that sweep, so these are just like local little tournaments

540
00:59:00.64 --> 00:59:05.52
where you go out and you score and you're like, you know, my, my eight's pretty close to a 10,

541
00:59:05.52 --> 00:59:10.48
and I'm going to give it to myself. So there's no one watching, because just you just can't

542
00:59:10.48 --> 00:59:15.76
you're like on a path through like through this course, to where it's not like golf,

543
00:59:16.56 --> 00:59:21.92
like professional golf, there'd be like a crowd following like those leaders through that course,

544
00:59:22.72 --> 00:59:28.64
which in professional archery like that happens. And then once you get into shooting in the finals,

545
00:59:28.64 --> 00:59:34.88
a lot of times it's like on monitors and everything, so obviously people can see on a big screen,

546
00:59:35.60 --> 00:59:41.20
where the arrows are landing. So I mean, it probably the same and competitive like rifle and stuff like that.

547
00:59:41.20 --> 00:59:45.12
Yeah, it's the same in competitive anything. You like really like when you're at a local

548
00:59:45.12 --> 00:59:51.04
tournament or a weather, it's freaking bowling, you know, like over the line, you know, markets

549
00:59:51.04 --> 00:59:55.52
zero, they're just having an argument, you know, it's like you can cheat. And then, but then you turn in

550
00:59:55.52 --> 01:00:02.08
like a score card or something. So when you shoot, you score however many points you, and then you

551
01:00:02.08 --> 01:00:06.56
write it on a card that you want to the next target. And then you go through a course. Yeah.

552
01:00:06.56 --> 01:00:10.80
And then you turn in the card. Yeah, it'd be like you play in cribbids with someone at home and

553
01:00:10.80 --> 01:00:16.72
then I'll send you like, up, I won. They're like, well, wait a minute. Dude, we have to be at least

554
01:00:16.72 --> 01:00:22.40
even. You're like, no, I'm keeping score like you're so old. Or you go to Vegas and play cribbids,

555
01:00:22.40 --> 01:00:28.32
just like, you know, everything you're doing is under, you know, amagging the final class type thing.

556
01:00:28.32 --> 01:00:33.52
So what point did you make the transition? What was it the whole time from like 3D archery to

557
01:00:33.52 --> 01:00:41.60
target archery? Um, I got I honestly got a little bit bored and 3D archery pretty fast and part of

558
01:00:41.60 --> 01:00:48.40
the part of what I didn't like about it. There's just, I felt like I was going to the same

559
01:00:48.40 --> 01:00:55.92
place as all the time because there was I'm trying to think I turned pro and 98. So by like 2003,

560
01:00:55.92 --> 01:01:01.12
I just felt like I would land know how to get to the shoot without even like,

561
01:01:02.16 --> 01:01:07.04
wouldn't even need to like look at a map. I'd just know where to go and then you go to these courses

562
01:01:07.04 --> 01:01:14.24
and it would be like, well, a lot like, you know, we shot big sky together, you know, for the total

563
01:01:14.24 --> 01:01:22.64
archery challenge and we've shot the same course because it ends in a good place, you know.

564
01:01:24.40 --> 01:01:30.16
But there's certainly targets that you like you would be like, oh, last year we had the white bunny

565
01:01:30.16 --> 01:01:35.12
right here, you know. And so it got to the point where it was like that. I was going to places

566
01:01:35.12 --> 01:01:44.40
around, you know, 26 or 30 weekends a year. I'm traveling to do tournaments and it just felt super

567
01:01:44.40 --> 01:01:53.52
repetitive and in the end I realized there's probably 10 or 12 people that are fully capable of

568
01:01:53.52 --> 01:01:59.52
winning like any weekend. But it's almost like if you had that same tournament, you know,

569
01:01:59.52 --> 01:02:06.000
two consecutive days over and over and over again, there's probably like five that would win it

570
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:12.88
differently each of those times. And I don't know, it just came, it just got to be

571
01:02:12.88 --> 01:02:19.44
stale for me. I got, you know, I just really got bored with that and it got to the point where

572
01:02:19.44 --> 01:02:26.32
I pretty much had it set in my mind of, I'm a target archer to be a better bow hunter, you know.

573
01:02:26.32 --> 01:02:32.80
And that was like my mentality is I was just, I could barely be focused by the time the world

574
01:02:32.80 --> 01:02:39.12
championships rolled around in August. I barely cared because I just wanted to be hunting in September.

575
01:02:40.16 --> 01:02:46.80
And, you know, that the hunting was always the focus for me and it was like, I almost, I got more

576
01:02:46.80 --> 01:02:53.60
out of it. So, you know, I just eventually, I did what I needed to do in competitive archery to like

577
01:02:53.60 --> 01:03:00.80
help me build a platform to where I really wanted to go, which is I've always liked to coach, you know,

578
01:03:00.80 --> 01:03:08.88
and, and I've always liked really good coaches, you know, I've liked, I'm the type of person where

579
01:03:08.88 --> 01:03:18.16
I liked coaches that like, honestly that like yelled at me and were like, Paris had coaches,

580
01:03:18.16 --> 01:03:24.08
we're, you know, Sharon said, that guy just sat there and like, I kind of think I would love that guy.

581
01:03:24.08 --> 01:03:30.72
You know, if he like grabbed my face mask and he's yelling at me, like, it would make me do better

582
01:03:30.72 --> 01:03:38.000
on the next play. Whereas now as an adult, I've learned there's certain people where if you did that,

583
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:46.40
you're not getting that result. Yeah. Yeah. So, so, so wait a second. So, you're doing the target

584
01:03:46.40 --> 01:03:51.04
archery thing and then, or sorry, you're doing the 3D thing, then you start doing target archery.

585
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.44
Like, like, well, well, like, well, at what point are you part of team USA and you're putting on the

586
01:03:57.44 --> 01:04:04.96
team USA stuff? Dang, man, I don't like have my whole life outlined. So, um, I had retired,

587
01:04:04.96 --> 01:04:11.36
I, you know, I got sick of it, I retired and I was working at a bow manufacturer, you know,

588
01:04:11.36 --> 01:04:16.08
didn't go back to that, but at 18, um, you know, I started working for this archery shop,

589
01:04:16.96 --> 01:04:23.76
didn't like the one on one, experienced that archery shop owner was given people buying new equipment.

590
01:04:23.76 --> 01:04:29.84
And I was spending a lot of time with people. And so I got called in and he told me, you know,

591
01:04:29.84 --> 01:04:36.24
hey, do not spend that much time with people and they buy new gear. If they go over 15 minutes,

592
01:04:36.24 --> 01:04:42.08
they need to be paying coaching time per hour. And I just said, well, this, you know, no one was in the

593
01:04:42.08 --> 01:04:47.20
shop and I didn't have anything else to do. Why wouldn't we help this guy out? And I remember he said,

594
01:04:48.16 --> 01:04:55.12
well, if you want to run a business that way, then you need to go start your own archery shop.

595
01:04:56.08 --> 01:05:03.20
So I just thought, okay. And so I went and started my own archery shop, um, about 45 miles away

596
01:05:03.20 --> 01:05:10.40
at it was actually my family had a, had a horse ranch and Southern Wisconsin at the time, my mom and my sister.

597
01:05:10.96 --> 01:05:16.88
So I ended up building a pole building there and start my own shop. And that was the same time. I started

598
01:05:16.88 --> 01:05:23.92
shooting professionally. And then got offered a job from a bow manufacturer to move to northern Wisconsin

599
01:05:24.48 --> 01:05:32.24
to, you know, come in as like an early sales rep. So I ended up working for this bow company and competing.

600
01:05:32.24 --> 01:05:42.08
So I mean, my life was archery. Archery 20 hours a day. And then I kind of got burned out with it. And I found

601
01:05:42.08 --> 01:05:48.32
myself liking going fishing or going hunting or just doing something that wasn't like training,

602
01:05:48.32 --> 01:05:56.64
training, training for archery. And then I had retired for like a few months and retired from.

603
01:05:56.64 --> 01:06:01.76
I kind of just said, I'm not going to shoot professionally anymore. And I just stepped away. And I was

604
01:06:01.76 --> 01:06:06.96
doing some coaching. And like I was doing a lot for some different like youth camps and stuff.

605
01:06:08.80 --> 01:06:19.76
And I remember seeing another archer at like at a trade show. And he said something about,

606
01:06:19.76 --> 01:06:23.84
you know, I heard you're not shooting anymore. And I just said, yeah, I got, you know, bored with it.

607
01:06:23.84 --> 01:06:29.36
And I kind of just jokingly said, you know, maybe I'll come over to target archery. Just 3D

608
01:06:29.36 --> 01:06:36.88
archery is all like foam animal targets with molded in scoring rings, ranging from, you know,

609
01:06:36.88 --> 01:06:42.32
the size of a dime, you know, up to like what would be considered just the vitals, which would be bigger.

610
01:06:43.12 --> 01:06:48.56
But then target like a dinner plate size. Yeah. But then for target archery, there's several

611
01:06:48.56 --> 01:06:54.72
different formats. And that's bulls eyes, you know, with scoring rings. But a lot of different

612
01:06:54.72 --> 01:06:59.92
games to play, right, you know, there's tons of different formats of shooting at a bull's

613
01:06:59.92 --> 01:07:05.60
I target different distances. Some, you don't know the distance. You have to estimate it. Some have

614
01:07:05.60 --> 01:07:10.72
like multiple size faces, some are certain amount of arrows at this distance, certain amount of

615
01:07:10.72 --> 01:07:17.44
that distance at this. But anyway, I said to this guy, yeah, maybe I'll just, I don't know,

616
01:07:17.44 --> 01:07:23.76
maybe I should just try target archery. And I remember, he looked at me because, come on in the

617
01:07:23.76 --> 01:07:32.80
water's fine. Oh, thank you. Last week. And that was it. I was like, okay, wins the first tournament.

618
01:07:32.80 --> 01:07:40.88
And the first, he told me the first tournament was at the Arizona Cup in at the Ben Avery.

619
01:07:40.88 --> 01:07:47.28
Did you ever shoot the Ben Avery Center in Arizona? So that was the first one and ended up,

620
01:07:48.32 --> 01:07:53.12
ended up in the metal, you know, gold metal match with that guy at that event. With that guy,

621
01:07:53.12 --> 01:08:02.72
with that guy in your first event. Yeah, that one. And I showed up like everything I had was wrong

622
01:08:02.72 --> 01:08:09.12
because, you know, there's, I don't know how to describe it. It'd be like if you did, you know,

623
01:08:09.12 --> 01:08:15.20
tactical, you know, tactical competition and then someone will ask you to go to a sniper event

624
01:08:15.20 --> 01:08:19.68
and then you like showed up with your M4 or something. You know, I don't know. No, it's, it's mission

625
01:08:19.68 --> 01:08:25.44
specific. Yeah. They're both archery, but one of them has like you're standing around. You got

626
01:08:25.44 --> 01:08:29.36
more time to shoot or whatever. Last time to shoot. Yours gear's going to be different to

627
01:08:29.36 --> 01:08:38.000
homeland yards. Yeah. So I remember right before that metal match. And as it happened, I was

628
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.80
low in the brackets. He was, you know, very high in the brackets, but we were on opposite ends of

629
01:08:42.80 --> 01:08:50.48
the brackets. And so at this center, you know, there's, you know, let's say it's 100 yards wide.

630
01:08:50.48 --> 01:08:56.40
I was like at this end and he was at that end. And as you shoot against someone and go through

631
01:08:56.40 --> 01:09:03.60
the brackets, he just come to the middle. So like when I won my semi-final match, I remember like

632
01:09:03.60 --> 01:09:09.92
looking over and I saw that he won. I'm like, okay, here we go. And he comes over and he said,

633
01:09:09.92 --> 01:09:17.28
man, he's like, how, he's, he's said, how, how you deal with it? And I said, dealing with what? And

634
01:09:17.28 --> 01:09:24.08
he said, well, I've won this nine times and, you know, everyone wants me to lose and he said, so I

635
01:09:24.08 --> 01:09:30.64
can imagine like, you know, the pressure you're feeling, you know, being that guy. And I said,

636
01:09:30.64 --> 01:09:36.48
man, I, I see it the other way. And he goes, what do you mean? I said, do you know, I'm out here,

637
01:09:36.48 --> 01:09:42.56
my equipment's a joke. I said, I'm out here. I'm a 3D shooter. I got the wrong freaking bow. I got the

638
01:09:42.56 --> 01:09:48.88
wrong arrows. Never even shot this far. And I said, and I'm getting ready to roll up on you.

639
01:09:49.68 --> 01:09:57.12
And I said, and I'm like, you want to nine times. And honestly, I could see like that was, you know,

640
01:09:57.12 --> 01:10:03.36
that cracked and I ended up getting the gold medal there. Oh, you, so the person you wanted.

641
01:10:03.36 --> 01:10:10.08
Yeah, that's freaking nuts. So then I guess that pretty much kicked off your target archery.

642
01:10:10.08 --> 01:10:16.72
Yeah, yeah. So we, um, and there was a lot of, like, that kicked off my target archery. So I did one

643
01:10:16.72 --> 01:10:20.80
type, then I did another type. And then I went into field archery, which is my favorite.

644
01:10:21.44 --> 01:10:28.08
It's kind of like the tack, but with with different size bull's eyes and granted, you know,

645
01:10:28.08 --> 01:10:34.56
in the pro class, these guys aren't missing. It's like, you need perfect scores. You know, you really do.

646
01:10:34.56 --> 01:10:42.72
And I went to this field, um, this field tournament and just sucked at it because half of it is

647
01:10:42.72 --> 01:10:48.56
marked. The other half is unmarked. So you unmarked, meaning unknown distance, unknown distance,

648
01:10:48.56 --> 01:10:52.96
which in archery is a problem if you don't know the distance, because your arrow is what

649
01:10:52.96 --> 01:10:59.76
waste lower than a bullet. So, um, I wasn't good at it and ended up buying myself an entire field

650
01:10:59.76 --> 01:11:07.68
round and like, you know, reading up on, you know, target faces and then ended up figuring out a

651
01:11:07.68 --> 01:11:14.80
mathematical formula to estimate distances using, like, the circles in my scope and the circles of the

652
01:11:14.80 --> 01:11:22.56
bull's eye. So I'd like frame the side of my scope to the edge of the target and then I memorized where

653
01:11:22.56 --> 01:11:31.04
my center dot would be based on the rings and just memorized, engaging a distance, gauging formula,

654
01:11:31.04 --> 01:11:36.64
which is what everybody does, but most people keep it secretive on how, you know, what their system is.

655
01:11:37.76 --> 01:11:42.24
But because of the targets, they're all regulation and they have to be the same size you can figure it out.

656
01:11:43.20 --> 01:11:49.84
So then, um, I got good at that, you know, and, and that was kind of my favorite and then, you know,

657
01:11:49.84 --> 01:11:56.72
made a team, made a U.S. team and then went over and competed. I think my first international

658
01:11:56.72 --> 01:12:05.36
term, it was in Croatia and, you know, freaking just loved, metal there and, you know, loved, freaking

659
01:12:05.36 --> 01:12:11.12
when they pulled that American flag up and like, you got to hear your anthem, it was just like,

660
01:12:11.12 --> 01:12:17.44
okay, this is freaking, this is awesome. And so how long did that career run for?

661
01:12:17.44 --> 01:12:27.92
That career ran until the archery world archery decided to do a world cup and they decided to make the

662
01:12:27.92 --> 01:12:35.36
world cup, um, so at the world cup, I think only two at the year. At the time, it was maybe two or three

663
01:12:35.36 --> 01:12:42.40
archers, you had to be on a team, um, which shoot in the world cups, but whoever the finalists,

664
01:12:42.40 --> 01:12:48.08
the top four were at the end of the world cup, then you had to go to the world cup finals,

665
01:12:48.08 --> 01:12:55.60
which was like a big thing. And they decided to add one tournament and move the world cup

666
01:12:55.60 --> 01:13:06.16
finals. It was like September 15th this year. And so I remember, um, world archery telling me,

667
01:13:06.16 --> 01:13:12.000
you know, hey, if you're going to shoot on the world cup team, you have to give us the commitment

668
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.44
that you will not only do all four world cups, but if you make the world cup final that you

669
01:13:17.44 --> 01:13:24.56
also participate in the world cup final, otherwise we're going to find someone that will, you know,

670
01:13:24.56 --> 01:13:29.04
because we don't want to like end up making a final and then someone don't can't get off work or

671
01:13:29.04 --> 01:13:34.48
whatever. And so I, you know, as in September, I just said, I am not competing in archery in September.

672
01:13:34.48 --> 01:13:40.48
And for everyone that doesn't know, September is freaking prime, that's something. Yeah.

673
01:13:40.48 --> 01:13:44.08
That's when you, you're only thinking about, you're thinking about one thing and one thing.

674
01:13:44.08 --> 01:13:52.40
Yes, just freaking hunting. That's it. That's it. And so you kind of walked. Yeah, I walked.

675
01:13:53.84 --> 01:13:59.44
Now, and I walked for, I walked from there and then, you know, I ended up business wise,

676
01:14:01.44 --> 01:14:07.52
started consulting, went out on my own, started consulting, you know, started a family,

677
01:14:07.52 --> 01:14:13.60
sharing an eye, you know, it was like I wanted to be home more. A lot more people could come to me,

678
01:14:13.60 --> 01:14:19.12
you know, for coaching and stuff. I was, I was coaching around the world at that time.

679
01:14:20.48 --> 01:14:28.08
But yeah, just, you know, life changes. You become, you know, close to 30. It's just, you know, I didn't.

680
01:14:29.76 --> 01:14:36.08
I just didn't see the future that I wanted just being a target archer my whole life.

681
01:14:36.08 --> 01:14:40.56
You know, and I think, you know, we talked about this. I think some fighters are in that same

682
01:14:40.56 --> 01:14:47.20
position of like, yeah, you love it. And, you know, you can go when like fight of the night and you

683
01:14:47.20 --> 01:14:54.40
could make a pretty good paycheck for that time. But the reality is like, your one or two fights a year

684
01:14:54.40 --> 01:15:00.56
that you're going to make a paycheck at, they're going to make 98% of the rest of your life,

685
01:15:00.56 --> 01:15:07.20
not as, you know, not what you could make for it if you had a different focus. So, you know,

686
01:15:07.20 --> 01:15:15.04
I just, I just focused on something else. Now, from a business perspective, did you have the

687
01:15:15.04 --> 01:15:25.04
vision of like knock on archery? Because essentially what you do is freaking give away an incredible

688
01:15:25.04 --> 01:15:30.96
amount of knowledge and information and instruction. That's what you do. That did you know from

689
01:15:30.96 --> 01:15:36.56
the beginning, hey, listen, if I just give this stuff away, then people will, you know, want,

690
01:15:36.56 --> 01:15:40.40
want to buy some of the stuff that I recommend. You lie some of the equipment that I make.

691
01:15:40.40 --> 01:15:43.60
Is that did you have that vision or did it just start to happen?

692
01:15:45.60 --> 01:15:50.56
It's hard to say if I was in a different position than if I would have felt that way. Because

693
01:15:50.56 --> 01:15:58.80
I don't feel like I'm greedy. I feel like the better I do for myself and other avenues of life,

694
01:15:58.80 --> 01:16:04.40
the more I can give back to my sport and I want to because, you know, I feel like, hey, I'm

695
01:16:04.40 --> 01:16:09.92
doing fine. You know, and I want to help other people be better. But the truth of the matter is,

696
01:16:09.92 --> 01:16:16.96
you know, when you're in your 20s, making 30 grand a year or 50 grand a year, your job,

697
01:16:16.96 --> 01:16:22.16
and you're trying to go to tournaments to win an extra 10 on the weekend and you're just putting

698
01:16:22.16 --> 01:16:27.76
a lot of time in and you're shooting 20 to 30,000 arrows, you know, a year,

699
01:16:29.12 --> 01:16:34.80
and living out of, you know, sharing rooms with people and stuff like that. Like, there's a lot of

700
01:16:34.80 --> 01:16:39.60
stepping stones that have to, there's a lot of sacrifices you make before it gets to the point where

701
01:16:39.60 --> 01:16:50.08
it's like, you know, you could offer all that for free. But once the community and by that,

702
01:16:50.08 --> 01:16:57.04
I mean, you know, I refer to them as the knock on nation. Once we had a pedestal to where we were

703
01:16:57.04 --> 01:17:05.76
able to deliver out information and our community came in and started supporting that initiative,

704
01:17:05.76 --> 01:17:13.92
then it allows me, you know, the more people support like either things that we offer at the

705
01:17:13.92 --> 01:17:22.16
store or let's say I do a training series and there's a training series that helps someone do better,

706
01:17:22.16 --> 01:17:27.60
but maybe there's a product that we have as our business. You know, that'll be in there and I know

707
01:17:27.60 --> 01:17:33.44
not everyone's going to buy it. But if someone does, you know, if they really like that series

708
01:17:33.44 --> 01:17:38.48
and it was worth, you know, a hundred bucks to them, I would rather than sit in them paying

709
01:17:38.48 --> 01:17:46.000
that subscription to like support us with, you know, a product that we have that I personally believe

710
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:52.80
in for that particular thing. Now everyone has their preference, but I don't think I could have

711
01:17:52.80 --> 01:17:59.44
done it that way to begin with even though when I was kind of hustling and doing what I could

712
01:17:59.44 --> 01:18:07.12
to like, you know, build, I would always go and do youth camps or go do Christian camps and do

713
01:18:07.12 --> 01:18:12.80
stuff like that for free. Like I always did that. I always worked with, you know, the kids after

714
01:18:12.80 --> 01:18:21.68
the tournament or, you know, it kind of got to the point where I told sponsors, especially when I

715
01:18:21.68 --> 01:18:27.04
went out and I was kind of consulting, I told sponsors, I would like to travel through Europe

716
01:18:27.04 --> 01:18:35.52
and go to every archery club and do a seminar. But, you know, I can't pay for it myself. Would you,

717
01:18:35.52 --> 01:18:42.32
you know, would you like to be the one that sponsors the event in Doosal Dwarf, you know, and if so

718
01:18:42.32 --> 01:18:47.60
send me 25 of your hats and some keychains or whatever and that's what we'll put on everyone's

719
01:18:47.60 --> 01:18:53.68
seat that, you know, that comes. And so we just do these tours where I'd have magazine editors

720
01:18:53.68 --> 01:19:00.64
drive me all around Europe and every day was a different stop, you know, just kind of like a band.

721
01:19:00.64 --> 01:19:06.64
Every day was a different archery club, stop, teach archery and then, you know, do it. In the end,

722
01:19:07.68 --> 01:19:14.72
I made something more because, you know, the sponsors were paying something and, you know,

723
01:19:14.72 --> 01:19:19.12
getting some exposure from it and then I also did a lot of writing. You know, I did a lot of

724
01:19:19.12 --> 01:19:26.16
a lot of written coaching first because like getting your foot in the door when you don't

725
01:19:26.56 --> 01:19:33.28
technically have like a name for yourself yet is a little bit of a struggle. But I saw a lot of

726
01:19:33.28 --> 01:19:40.40
magazines needing fresh content and so, you know, I just started writing. So, from like

727
01:19:40.40 --> 01:19:55.76
2000, I would say from 2005 to probably 2000, 12 or 14, I wrote for like seven different languages.

728
01:19:55.76 --> 01:20:03.84
I'd probably do about 250 pages a year just in articles and honestly, my thing was I'd send

729
01:20:03.84 --> 01:20:09.04
these articles out. I didn't really make hardly anything off any of the articles. I just always

730
01:20:09.04 --> 01:20:15.92
made sure that they used my photo content so that, you know, I was able to give exposure to the

731
01:20:15.92 --> 01:20:22.88
brands that I represented and so, you know, it's just kind of like the perfect storm of having

732
01:20:22.88 --> 01:20:29.92
enough support to where I could grow into where I wanted to be and then, you know, then eventually

733
01:20:29.92 --> 01:20:36.40
like knock on knock on's like evolved. Originally, it was a TV show, it was just a hunting show,

734
01:20:36.40 --> 01:20:41.68
but it was a hunting show that I was very focused on having educational portions. I didn't

735
01:20:41.68 --> 01:20:47.12
like be role in hunting shows, you know, I didn't. I always thought there needs to be more

736
01:20:47.12 --> 01:20:54.08
education and how to and why was this hunt successful or here's the equipment that I'm taking on

737
01:20:54.08 --> 01:20:59.92
this hunt, you know, I changed arrows or changed broadheads, here's the why, you know, here's

738
01:20:59.92 --> 01:21:05.44
different mistakes you can make as a bow hunter for shooting technique. So, that kind of gave us

739
01:21:05.44 --> 01:21:13.12
the platform to create a name for ourselves and then obviously, you know, we've just continually built

740
01:21:13.12 --> 01:21:19.44
we meaning I've only ever done the content, the brand was always sharing, you know, the brand

741
01:21:19.44 --> 01:21:27.60
and, you know, knock on archery.com has always been sharing, where is, you know, I really don't like

742
01:21:27.60 --> 01:21:33.68
that side of things, I just really want to like, I want to teach people from my experience of

743
01:21:33.68 --> 01:21:40.40
whatever's happening at the moment. How the TV show come about? The TV show came because

744
01:21:42.64 --> 01:21:50.000
one of the companies that I worked for was an archery company and so each year they would pick a

745
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:56.48
a certain demographic and tell me to focus my initiatives there to grow the brand and that

746
01:21:56.48 --> 01:22:04.000
demographic. So, one time it was, you know, South Africa, another time it was like Germany,

747
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.84
another time it was Australia but it came around to Canada and so I went up and talked to a lot of

748
01:22:09.84 --> 01:22:15.20
shops up there and said, you know, hey, what do you guys think about doing like a seminar tour like

749
01:22:15.20 --> 01:22:21.04
what was working for me and other demographics? Because over there, people were jumping on that

750
01:22:21.04 --> 01:22:25.68
because no one would travel over there to do that. Maybe it's like that, what you just see,

751
01:22:25.68 --> 01:22:30.32
if a, if a reputable coach travels to somewhere where they're never going to see that person,

752
01:22:30.32 --> 01:22:35.36
they, it'll sell out, you know, for sure. Versus in Canada, they said, at the time,

753
01:22:36.64 --> 01:22:42.56
Canada just got their first outdoor TV network, which was called Wild TV and they had hunting

754
01:22:42.56 --> 01:22:48.40
shows but most of their shows were shows that we had watched here five, 10 years ago and it was just

755
01:22:49.04 --> 01:22:53.52
all the shows domestically were sent in all their repeats up there and just like, you know, just

756
01:22:53.52 --> 01:23:00.24
kind of rebranding. But then also like selling that airtime to their sponsors here like, yeah,

757
01:23:00.24 --> 01:23:08.32
we're also airing, you know, 10 times a week in Canada for this or that. So when I was up there,

758
01:23:08.32 --> 01:23:17.12
the shop said, well, I mean, we would love to get like super technical seminars but what brings

759
01:23:17.12 --> 01:23:21.04
people in the doors when the hunting shows come. Like if, if you're on a hunting show,

760
01:23:21.04 --> 01:23:28.32
there, if you're on Wild TV, we'll freaking pack the store. So I remember going back to my boss

761
01:23:28.32 --> 01:23:34.08
at the time who actually works for us now and I told him I said, well, they really said to get

762
01:23:34.08 --> 01:23:41.28
the foot in the door like, we need to be, I need to be a show and I had already done DVDs that were like,

763
01:23:41.84 --> 01:23:48.72
you know, kind of out of the, the trunk of your car DVDs that I thought were a little bit of

764
01:23:48.72 --> 01:23:56.000
head of their time because I always said that like I wanted our hunting show to be like hunting,

765
01:23:56.72 --> 01:24:06.08
kind of crashed with MTV cribs, crashed with like Robin Big. And so like our first DVDs,

766
01:24:06.08 --> 01:24:12.16
that's what they were. And so they were to like way faster pace music and like way different editing

767
01:24:12.16 --> 01:24:17.84
than kind of like the band you put those on YouTube. I haven't, I need to get you one of those DVDs.

768
01:24:17.84 --> 01:24:23.12
How can we go put them on YouTube on your YouTube channel? People are going to be amped to watch it now.

769
01:24:23.12 --> 01:24:29.52
Maybe that I mean, looking bad, be like you watching yourself on video 10 years ago, you'd be like,

770
01:24:29.52 --> 01:24:34.24
man was I horrible. Well, you at least got to have some fun with it and put them on. Oh, yeah,

771
01:24:34.24 --> 01:24:43.44
I mean, for that haircut you posted. Prince Valkyrie, the kind of guy. That was freaking awesome.

772
01:24:43.44 --> 01:24:49.28
Bro, it was 1977. That was what was happening. And I didn't, I don't think I even have. I don't think,

773
01:24:49.28 --> 01:24:54.64
I don't even think I thought, you know what I'm saying? I didn't think I thought about like a haircut.

774
01:24:54.64 --> 01:24:59.28
I think it was just, you know, my mom would come in with a pair of scissors. You know, done.

775
01:24:59.28 --> 01:25:04.000
Like I wasn't like, do I need hair? I still have a minute. Yeah. Do I need to get a haircut? Do I not

776
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.92
need to get a haircut? She's just like, that's, it was like, that's what's happening, right? You don't have

777
01:25:08.88 --> 01:25:13.04
any choice in the matter. And didn't care about it one way that I still barely care. I feel like

778
01:25:13.04 --> 01:25:17.84
when we post this podcast, we need to put a thing in there that says like, unless you're

779
01:25:17.84 --> 01:25:26.64
to work about our tree fast forward to like the hair moment. Because me talking about my past to

780
01:25:26.64 --> 01:25:32.48
me seems like, I don't know, I'd weigh rather. What I remember about you, the most is like,

781
01:25:32.48 --> 01:25:39.20
how hard we laugh at stuff. And you know, it's such a different side than, you know,

782
01:25:39.20 --> 01:25:45.12
kind of like at the beginning of the thing when you're reading your socials and awesome at that,

783
01:25:45.12 --> 01:25:52.48
like you're the perfect person to like do voice over work. But I also know like any given second,

784
01:25:52.48 --> 01:25:58.40
if it was just the two of us, you could drop a one liner in there that would freaking bust people up in

785
01:25:58.40 --> 01:26:05.04
here. Yeah, I definitely, I mean, that's, bro, yeah, you're right. Any of this stuff. It's like,

786
01:26:05.04 --> 01:26:09.68
you have a fun while you're doing it. It's not fun to do. Then why are you doing it? Yeah,

787
01:26:10.08 --> 01:26:14.64
I will say though, like I like to have fun. You like to have fun, but man, it's legit. When you go into

788
01:26:14.64 --> 01:26:21.84
like Kilmode on a hunt, it's freaking out. I'm like, oh, yeah, here it is. Because you go into just like

789
01:26:21.84 --> 01:26:26.72
boom, like I could, I just see I'm like, okay, I gotta hang on because he's freaking, he's going. And

790
01:26:26.72 --> 01:26:33.92
it's legit, man. Well, I think that same thing that's just inside, it's dormant and I'm pretty,

791
01:26:33.92 --> 01:26:42.16
I'm pretty like Loki and Dossel most of the time. I feel like that's how I am naturally, but then

792
01:26:43.52 --> 01:26:50.56
certain things like that when that moment triggers and it's like a game face, that's kind of what

793
01:26:50.56 --> 01:26:56.48
happened when I recognized like I wasn't good at archery. You know, I realized like, you know,

794
01:26:56.48 --> 01:27:04.56
I just, it's like hyper focused and it gets that way with my training too. If I know I'm not

795
01:27:05.44 --> 01:27:13.92
up to par, I get very hyper focused on just getting better and training and I can kind of just go

796
01:27:13.92 --> 01:27:19.12
over the deep, you know, I can either be all in or totally out, which is kind of like for

797
01:27:19.12 --> 01:27:25.28
Matargetartary point of view, people ask me why I don't compete. I don't have, like I don't have

798
01:27:25.28 --> 01:27:32.56
a drive to compete. That's not to say if for some reason I, you know, did it accidentally and

799
01:27:32.56 --> 01:27:37.36
I would get fired up again. Oh no, I've seen you do that. I've seen you that where we're walking

800
01:27:37.36 --> 01:27:43.28
down the tack and all of a sudden someone's like, hey, dud, I bet I can do this. I bet I can hit that.

801
01:27:43.28 --> 01:27:47.52
You're like, same thing. I'll see your face and I'm like, oh, he's about to just 12,

802
01:27:47.52 --> 01:27:52.48
bring this thing, you know, because you get in that competitive mode that happens. You know what,

803
01:27:52.48 --> 01:27:56.64
I wanted to come back to and, and hey, the reason why I think this stuff is interesting. Look,

804
01:27:56.64 --> 01:28:03.52
I don't think you have to be interested in archery because your, your path in life was not normal,

805
01:28:03.52 --> 01:28:07.84
right? And people look, you could have been talking about someone that was into spearfishing or someone

806
01:28:07.84 --> 01:28:14.24
that was into jiu-jitsu or someone that was into anything to go down the path like you did and

807
01:28:14.24 --> 01:28:19.20
forge your own way ahead and make a life for yourself based on doing something that you loved.

808
01:28:19.20 --> 01:28:24.40
People could apply that in any category, whether you're into knitting or whether you're into freaking

809
01:28:25.20 --> 01:28:30.000
bowling, it doesn't matter. So there's some real application. I guess I should have said that the

810
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.44
beginning, hey, if you're thinking about the way your life looks, especially if you're 20 years old or

811
01:28:35.44 --> 01:28:38.64
25 years old and you're kind of like, well, I'm doing this, but I don't like it. I mean,

812
01:28:38.64 --> 01:28:41.68
here you are, like, going to college, but I don't really want to do that, you know? Yeah.

813
01:28:41.68 --> 01:28:45.92
Hey, and you've done that multiple times, 3D archery, totally into, oh, guess what? I'm not

814
01:28:45.92 --> 01:28:49.44
really into it that much into it anymore. Okay, I'm going to do something else. Go to target

815
01:28:49.44 --> 01:28:52.56
archery. Okay. I'm really into that for a while. I guess what? It's interfering with my

816
01:28:52.56 --> 01:28:55.84
hunting. Not going to do that anymore. Now I'm going to focus on hunting. I'm going to focus on building

817
01:28:55.84 --> 01:29:01.20
this brand. I'm going to focus on creating new products. So all that stuff, it may seem mundane to you

818
01:29:01.84 --> 01:29:07.12
looking back at it, but for a normal person that can take this and apply it to, you know,

819
01:29:08.64 --> 01:29:14.40
building something, creating something, it's like you've done well, not just from an archery perspective,

820
01:29:14.40 --> 01:29:20.64
but a business perspective, in, at the same time. So it's real lessons. One of the lessons I

821
01:29:20.64 --> 01:29:25.44
wanted to come back to, because we kind of drifted over it, but when you were talking about,

822
01:29:25.44 --> 01:29:32.88
as somewhere along the way, you realized that you could like freaking rage doesn't help, right?

823
01:29:32.88 --> 01:29:36.000
Rage doesn't help, and you said you had a coach that was like, hey, listen,

824
01:29:36.56 --> 01:29:40.40
the arrows that you shot, and this is such an important, again, this is a life lesson, and

825
01:29:40.40 --> 01:29:45.04
there's all kinds of things that tie into life and archery, but the life lesson is like, hey,

826
01:29:45.04 --> 01:29:51.28
you shot that arrow and you freaking shanked it, right? You can blow your next eight arrows,

827
01:29:51.28 --> 01:29:56.96
like you can just send them all out the freaking, you know, into a tree somewhere, or you can just be like,

828
01:29:56.96 --> 01:30:02.000
okay, that didn't, doesn't matter. Can't change it, move forward. What was that lesson like,

829
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:09.28
who taught it to you? An Olympic arch, an Olympic archery coach who I'm pretty sure was also a

830
01:30:09.28 --> 01:30:15.84
Marine, I mean, straight up Marine haircut all the time, but he coached a couple, a couple,

831
01:30:16.48 --> 01:30:23.84
super high-level archers, but he was also like, he didn't coach very many people, and he was also,

832
01:30:23.84 --> 01:30:31.20
you know, very, I don't know, he was very like stone, you know, so you knew if he was there,

833
01:30:31.20 --> 01:30:39.20
he was there watching his few athletes, and they like would pay for him to come and stuff like that,

834
01:30:39.20 --> 01:30:47.04
but I remember one time I was in a leading group, we got peer grouped, and then the second day,

835
01:30:47.04 --> 01:30:53.12
you know, like ranks 1, 2, 3 and 4 together on the target, you know, in the shoot through, and then it

836
01:30:53.12 --> 01:31:00.08
kind of came down to the last target, and you know, I needed a 12 or something to make it into the

837
01:31:00.08 --> 01:31:09.44
shoot off, you know, into the top 6, and I missed, you know, and I was freaking pissed about, you know,

838
01:31:09.44 --> 01:31:14.56
like broke my stabilizer over my knee and freaking hammer tossed my bow through the woods type thing,

839
01:31:15.44 --> 01:31:21.92
and, you know, ended up coming back, like with my bow, just kind of seeing the damage I did,

840
01:31:21.92 --> 01:31:32.08
and he came over to me, his name was Tim Strickland, and he said, you know, you could be an amazing

841
01:31:32.08 --> 01:31:39.04
archer, but he said, until you start not letting the arrow that you shoot affect the ones that are

842
01:31:39.04 --> 01:31:45.76
still in your quiver, you never will, and he said, he goes, do you know a way to get an arrow back once

843
01:31:45.76 --> 01:31:50.24
it's left your bow, and I said, what do you mean he goes, do you know a way to get it back other

844
01:31:50.24 --> 01:31:53.92
than to physically go down there and pull it out of the target like you just did, and I said no

845
01:31:53.92 --> 01:32:00.88
sir, and he said, well, once it's gone, it's gone, and he said, so if you make one mistake,

846
01:32:02.48 --> 01:32:08.56
don't make the same mistake for every arrow that's left in your quiver, you know, make one,

847
01:32:09.68 --> 01:32:14.96
pull it, you know, pull that arrow out, throw it away, whatever you want, but there's other

848
01:32:14.96 --> 01:32:21.04
arrows in the quiver that are capable of doing what you want them to do, and so there's been

849
01:32:21.04 --> 01:32:26.64
tournaments where I've, you know, I've actually talked, you know, where I will freaking make a bad

850
01:32:26.64 --> 01:32:30.80
shot, and then just look down on my quiver and be like, do any of you sons of bitches want to

851
01:32:30.80 --> 01:32:36.48
go in the tenoring because that guy didn't, and you know, and it was just like a totally different

852
01:32:36.48 --> 01:32:49.76
approach and mentally, it honestly helped me, this was a, it's kind of a weird thing to say,

853
01:32:49.76 --> 01:32:56.56
but, you know, he told me said, you won't figure out how to win until you learn how to lose,

854
01:32:57.44 --> 01:33:05.20
and that was, you know, I was like the rage of losing was overpowering my ability to perform at

855
01:33:05.20 --> 01:33:10.80
my best because I was letting, you know, I was letting those things happen, and then I remember

856
01:33:10.80 --> 01:33:15.68
kind of wanting to get into that a little more, and I read some kind of a sports psychology

857
01:33:16.48 --> 01:33:20.96
book, you know, I don't know what it was called, but it said something in there that

858
01:33:21.92 --> 01:33:26.80
this sports psychologist had talked to like, he worked with a lot of high-level pictures,

859
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:34.88
and he told him that part of their success was that they had to be able to accept that there was

860
01:33:34.88 --> 01:33:40.40
going to be an empire that would, they needed to expect two to three bad calls by the

861
01:33:40.40 --> 01:33:47.60
empire, every game, and when they got a call that they didn't think was right, they could just

862
01:33:47.60 --> 01:33:53.44
check it off the list of okay, well, there was one of them, and so I started doing that too,

863
01:33:53.44 --> 01:33:59.28
and started saying, okay, when I go to an international event because there are certainly

864
01:33:59.28 --> 01:34:06.32
our judges that call them really, really tight, you know, and they're all looking at them with

865
01:34:06.32 --> 01:34:11.36
the magnifying glass, but they're some like when you'll say like judge, and then, you know,

866
01:34:13.36 --> 01:34:19.36
some dude comes over that isn't a tour, like if that, you know, when they do the random thing of

867
01:34:19.36 --> 01:34:23.44
like judge, so and so go pull it, and then you see him, you're like, it's out.

868
01:34:23.44 --> 01:34:30.000
Because some of them, you just think like, they think like if they can't figure it out themselves,

869
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.84
I'm just going to go over there and look around at it, but I'm calling it out, and then there'd

870
01:34:33.84 --> 01:34:39.84
be some like, oh yeah, I got a chance with this guy, like, you know, hey, Susie, how you doing today?

871
01:34:39.84 --> 01:34:47.68
Yeah. But yeah, learning that, you know, learning how to lose, because I've lost way

872
01:34:47.68 --> 01:34:55.76
more than I've won, and that's a fact, you know, you have to figure out a way to win in life,

873
01:34:55.76 --> 01:35:04.000
you know, you do have to figure out a way to win, but if you deal with like being a hyper-competitive,

874
01:35:04.80 --> 01:35:11.36
then you also have to learn how to lose, otherwise you freaking derail yourself, way more than

875
01:35:11.36 --> 01:35:17.52
others can derail you, and I'm convinced that I beat myself way more than other people beat

876
01:35:17.52 --> 01:35:23.20
me and most of the things that I've lost at, you know, it's like, which is why now my coachings

877
01:35:23.20 --> 01:35:29.84
involved so much, because now my coaching is so focused on, you know, what you execute within your

878
01:35:29.84 --> 01:35:37.28
box, because I kind of got to the point where I recognized if I make a good shot, it's a 10,

879
01:35:37.28 --> 01:35:44.40
that's the highest score on the paper. So if I do that all day, no one's going to beat me,

880
01:35:44.40 --> 01:35:50.24
we're tied at the end, and if I just keep doing that until tomorrow, then guess what, worst case

881
01:35:50.24 --> 01:35:57.20
scenario, me and that other guy are still tied, but if I shoot nines, then yeah, the other guy

882
01:35:57.20 --> 01:36:04.48
is already in advantage. So, you know, if I focus on just execution, and so once I kind of came to

883
01:36:04.48 --> 01:36:12.32
that realization of no one can beat me if I'm executing, if I make a good shot right here,

884
01:36:12.32 --> 01:36:17.20
I don't need to see where it lands, because if my site tapes right, and I trust the equipment

885
01:36:17.20 --> 01:36:23.28
that I've got, I know it's in the middle, like I know that, but I have to execute here, and so

886
01:36:23.28 --> 01:36:28.88
it really got to the point where I like, I took away my spotting scope to where I wasn't getting

887
01:36:28.88 --> 01:36:34.48
in the habit of shooting an arrow looking for the result, shooting an arrow looking in a result,

888
01:36:34.48 --> 01:36:41.68
which is something that even today, when I work with parents, I tell them that there's,

889
01:36:41.68 --> 01:36:47.84
there's like parents that at an archery tournament, they sit like front row with a spotting scope,

890
01:36:47.84 --> 01:36:53.76
so the kid will shoot, and then they'll be like 10 at 11 o'clock, and then, you know,

891
01:36:53.76 --> 01:37:00.000
the kid will shoot and just turn around to like dad to get confirmation of like how that was,

892
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:05.44
and so part of the things when you have that type of parent is telling them like, listen,

893
01:37:05.44 --> 01:37:14.48
this kid, like they need to execute, them looking for you at you for, you know, the result,

894
01:37:14.48 --> 01:37:21.44
all the time, it just athletes start to lean on their coach so much, and that was actually one of the

895
01:37:21.44 --> 01:37:28.72
problems with some of the people that had that coach that I talked about. They only did really well

896
01:37:28.72 --> 01:37:34.08
when he could be there with them, because, you know, he'd be like, all right, hey, you miss that one,

897
01:37:34.08 --> 01:37:40.72
if those guys, you know, you're good, you're the free, you know, and they had to have that, that

898
01:37:40.72 --> 01:37:48.72
continual like affirmation, whereas honestly, for my life, I feel like most of it, I was alone,

899
01:37:48.72 --> 01:37:55.68
you know, in regards to like, I like training alone, you know, honestly, I like archery too,

900
01:37:55.68 --> 01:38:06.16
because it's a singular sport, so if I train and if I prep, then I'm ready, and it's in my hands,

901
01:38:06.16 --> 01:38:10.80
same with hunting, you know, same way with hunting. If I, you know, I've had hunts where I've had a lot of

902
01:38:10.80 --> 01:38:16.24
distractions, and I threw my stuff in a case that, you know, the day before and went and, you know,

903
01:38:16.24 --> 01:38:21.20
missed a couple shots and was just like, in rage, but then I also thought like, yeah, dude, you didn't

904
01:38:21.20 --> 01:38:27.36
prep, you didn't know homework, you know, that's what happens. So I feel like, because I've had to

905
01:38:27.36 --> 01:38:34.000
train that way, and even even when I lift, you know, I love lifting by myself versus like going to

906
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:41.76
somewhere where people distract me, I just feel like, you know, I've, I know that if I put in the work,

907
01:38:42.80 --> 01:38:49.92
then at that point, it's, it's really on me, not on someone else, and like, when I told you,

908
01:38:49.92 --> 01:38:57.20
we sucked it football, you know, there was a couple people like, you know, like Jason, who knew their role

909
01:38:57.20 --> 01:39:01.76
and knew their position, and other people's position, and they would cover for people that maybe

910
01:39:01.76 --> 01:39:08.08
didn't do something right, but there's also three cores of the team that didn't. So in high school,

911
01:39:08.40 --> 01:39:14.80
what's hard is, I don't feel like anyone really prepped as hard as me in that because I honestly

912
01:39:14.80 --> 01:39:20.08
like put no effort anywhere else, you know, whereas they probably had lives and maybe, you know,

913
01:39:20.08 --> 01:39:28.40
actually got good grades and stuff. But I think that's why artre's been so awesome to me is because,

914
01:39:29.12 --> 01:39:34.16
you know, the harder I've pushed, the harder I've pushed at it and the more I've put into it,

915
01:39:34.48 --> 01:39:40.72
like, it's not like weightlifting where you plateau, I haven't found a plateau yet, like,

916
01:39:40.72 --> 01:39:46.40
I can make a target further and I can suck again. Or, you know, you know, there's just

917
01:39:46.40 --> 01:39:53.04
ore I can try a different species or a different, you know, climate or a different time of year,

918
01:39:53.04 --> 01:39:59.12
and it's a whole new challenge, like it's a clean slate, and then you're, you know, trying to

919
01:39:59.92 --> 01:40:06.56
formulate a plan and map out a plan of how do I, you know, how do I, like, win this challenge?

920
01:40:06.56 --> 01:40:13.28
Or, I was at a, you know, I were at tack the first time we did tack and like I was just

921
01:40:14.72 --> 01:40:18.56
like feeling pretty good and I'm like, you know, you're like, bro, you're freaking, this is awesome,

922
01:40:18.56 --> 01:40:22.72
you're doing great and we're getting through the course a little bit and then man,

923
01:40:24.08 --> 01:40:31.60
then I just, I like hit a branch, right? And it was a little situation where you said step back

924
01:40:31.60 --> 01:40:38.000
and you meant back behind me, but I thought you meant back away from the target. And so I like

925
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.68
didn't, it even makes sense to me what you said, so I didn't listen to you, which is a mistake.

926
01:40:41.68 --> 01:40:45.52
So I just cracked off this round and this thing just freaking just,

927
01:40:47.12 --> 01:40:55.12
paying into a tree and everyone on that mountain, everyone, like, it sounded like you hit someone's

928
01:40:55.12 --> 01:41:00.08
like door with a Mac, like with a microphone on the back side, just there.

929
01:41:00.08 --> 01:41:04.24
And this is what I saw as earlier, you know, you're saying like, hey, you know,

930
01:41:04.24 --> 01:41:07.84
what somebody grabs me by the face mask and just like, you need to get this shit together right now.

931
01:41:07.84 --> 01:41:13.36
Like, that's what you want. And then, but like, I've, I've done that, like, when I was in,

932
01:41:13.36 --> 01:41:18.000
when I was in the, when I was in the seal teams and I was teaching, like, I would be, you know,

933
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.20
I'd have some guy that I could be like, hey, man, if I freak out in this guy, he's going to freak out.

934
01:41:21.60 --> 01:41:25.44
And he's going to collapse and break down mentally. And I got someone else where it was like,

935
01:41:25.44 --> 01:41:29.28
if I don't get their attention, you know, some guy might pull sides to hey, listen man, think about what's

936
01:41:29.28 --> 01:41:33.36
going on. Another guy in me, but hey, you need to think about what's going on. And you got to figure out what

937
01:41:33.36 --> 01:41:38.72
methodology you're going to use. Yeah. So what's what's interesting for me is when you're coaching me,

938
01:41:39.28 --> 01:41:44.32
like, I know what you're doing. I know that I go, oh, he's, he's trying to get me to chill out.

939
01:41:44.32 --> 01:41:47.92
Because like, on that one, you were like, you're like, hey, man, hit, you hit that limb up there.

940
01:41:47.92 --> 01:41:51.12
You know, it's just trying to say, but, you know, he said, you know, knocking another one,

941
01:41:51.12 --> 01:41:54.56
knock the ticket step back, knocking another one. I was like, cool. And I was like, he's just trying to

942
01:41:54.56 --> 01:42:00.80
get me to chill out. So I don't freak out because I just freaking tea bone to tree. And like, I know

943
01:42:00.80 --> 01:42:05.12
what you're doing, but as echo Charles says sometimes to me, he knows what I'm doing when I'm talking

944
01:42:05.12 --> 01:42:10.16
him about stuff. He's like, I know what you're doing. Guess what, still works. Yeah. It still works to be like,

945
01:42:10.16 --> 01:42:15.20
hey, here's it's going on. Man, just just back off a little bit or do your freaking out. You're not,

946
01:42:15.20 --> 01:42:19.36
you know how to do this. Like, those kind of coach and also being like, hey, get over here. Like,

947
01:42:19.36 --> 01:42:24.64
hey, you need to move down. Like, those kind of things are important. So for you as a coach, the way

948
01:42:24.64 --> 01:42:28.64
you read and I've watched now I've watched you coach a bunch, but like at tack, you'll sit there,

949
01:42:28.96 --> 01:42:33.68
like we'll sit there at a place at one of the targets and you'll just like watch four or five

950
01:42:33.68 --> 01:42:37.04
groups shoot. And so I just sit there and watch you coach him, you know, and I'll listen to what you're

951
01:42:37.04 --> 01:42:42.48
saying. And you, I can tell that you're going, you're reading people, you know, and going, oh,

952
01:42:42.48 --> 01:42:48.40
this person needs confidence or this person needs to think through needs to slow things down. Or this

953
01:42:48.40 --> 01:42:53.36
person's getting freaking all all target fixated at the last second and they're cracking around

954
01:42:53.36 --> 01:42:57.76
off. So you're reading them and then you're applying the right coaching technique to what's

955
01:42:57.76 --> 01:43:04.08
going on in their head. And that's freaking, that's just like, that's why honestly to me,

956
01:43:04.08 --> 01:43:08.80
your whole life, the number one thing for me when I look at you is like coach, like that's the

957
01:43:08.80 --> 01:43:12.40
the highest thing that I look at you. I was like, man, that guy's off. Look, he's a good

958
01:43:12.40 --> 01:43:18.32
arturer. He's a good hunter. He's a badass athlete, but man, he's a freaking dialed in coach.

959
01:43:19.92 --> 01:43:26.72
It's what I'm passionate about. Like, especially, you know, with honestly, Rogan

960
01:43:26.72 --> 01:43:34.16
introduced to me to Andy, like I think was really the thing that started everything down the path of

961
01:43:34.16 --> 01:43:40.40
now how many military guys that I've been able to get into and gals, get into archery.

962
01:43:40.40 --> 01:43:50.48
And, you know, I love that because there's so many things that are there, and especially with

963
01:43:51.36 --> 01:43:58.24
team guys, you know, whether it's, you know, army or, you know, it really doesn't matter.

964
01:43:59.04 --> 01:44:06.000
But if they've been some type of a team or like special forces, they just, you know,

965
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:11.36
they're good students and they're hyper critical of themselves. Now, granted, some of them were like,

966
01:44:11.36 --> 01:44:17.92
I got this and yeah, once they realized, no, I just made it as to myself, they'll listen.

967
01:44:18.48 --> 01:44:22.88
But even if they don't listen right there, by the next time they talked to you, they've a hundred

968
01:44:22.88 --> 01:44:30.32
percent, you know, went crazy about trying to apply that, you know, the work ethic is very,

969
01:44:30.32 --> 01:44:37.60
it's like the perfect formula for a coach, you know, is all those guys and every, every one of them

970
01:44:37.60 --> 01:44:47.04
that I've introduced it to so far has needed, has really needed archery as, I don't know, like,

971
01:44:47.04 --> 01:44:52.72
like you said, it's like a quiet, it's like a quiet form of what you used to do, you know.

972
01:44:52.72 --> 01:44:57.92
Well, what it is really, tell me it's a new mission. Like you spend your whole life

973
01:44:57.92 --> 01:45:04.40
with a mission, with like something that you know that you're focused on and then one day you wake up,

974
01:45:04.40 --> 01:45:09.12
like you retire or you get out, the mission's gone. Like you can't have it anymore and look,

975
01:45:09.12 --> 01:45:12.88
you can try and hang on onto it and you can try and freaking relive those things in your head,

976
01:45:12.88 --> 01:45:17.76
but that's not going to be, that's not going to work out because it's not there anymore.

977
01:45:17.76 --> 01:45:23.84
And that's a shitty reality to face. Like when I had to clean, when I retired and then I went and

978
01:45:23.84 --> 01:45:31.44
cleaned out my cage and I spent most of my career within like a 300-yard radius, like Seal Team

979
01:45:31.44 --> 01:45:37.92
1, Seal Team 3, Seal Team 7, I was at Seal Team 2 in Virginia Beach for a little while, but most of

980
01:45:37.92 --> 01:45:43.36
it, you could throw a football to everywhere I was. So when I was 19 years old, I was walking up

981
01:45:43.36 --> 01:45:50.40
the steps of Seal Team 1, fast forward 20, 24 years and I'm 200 yards away, not even, I'm 100 yards

982
01:45:50.40 --> 01:45:56.80
away, cleaning out my gear locker for the last time. And it's gone and all that, my whole life,

983
01:45:56.80 --> 01:46:03.04
what everything I cared about, the only thing I ever knew is gone. And look, I look back at it,

984
01:46:03.04 --> 01:46:09.36
if I can help out in any way and I go talk to the teams, that's cool, but that's not my mission anymore.

985
01:46:09.36 --> 01:46:15.12
And so this happens to guys and they get out and they don't have a mission anymore. So all of a

986
01:46:15.12 --> 01:46:21.44
sudden you go, hey man, here's a freaking bow and arrow, it's a primitive tool that you used a

987
01:46:21.44 --> 01:46:29.84
hunt ship and you can get good at it. And the fundamentals are similar, you know, the fundamentals are

988
01:46:29.84 --> 01:46:35.84
similar and like when you taught me for the first time Andy was sitting there translating. He's like,

989
01:46:35.84 --> 01:46:41.04
hey, what he means is frontside focus, hey, what he means is easy, easy, you know, uh, just squeeze the

990
01:46:41.04 --> 01:46:47.04
trigger. He was translating me for me, military stuff and I was like, oh God, it got it, got it. And,

991
01:46:47.04 --> 01:46:52.24
you know, Andy, I mean Andy's a good example of him just being like, oh cool, I got a new mission now.

992
01:46:52.24 --> 01:46:57.20
Here's what I can do. And look, Andy, of course, Andy has a ton of other things going on in his life

993
01:46:57.20 --> 01:47:02.96
and he's got freaking parachuting in, uh, jiu-jitsu now, he's totally obsessed with jiu-jitsu, which is

994
01:47:02.96 --> 01:47:07.84
freaking awesome. So people find new mission, but this is a good one. It's a good one because there's so

995
01:47:07.84 --> 01:47:12.16
many similarities, gear prep, right? When you're in the SEAL teams, you're freaking obsessed with gear

996
01:47:12.16 --> 01:47:15.60
prep, you're figuring out the best way to carry things, the best way to do things. And you're like,

997
01:47:15.60 --> 01:47:20.16
okay, I want to be ready for this. I want to be ready for this operation, right? I got to be in

998
01:47:20.16 --> 01:47:26.16
a good physical shape. I got to be able to like clear my mind when shit's going sideways and be like,

999
01:47:26.16 --> 01:47:32.000
all right, what's happening right now. So all those things are are so similar and I know that you

1000
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:39.12
spend, I guess, was Andy the first like vet that you worked with? Probably that, I mean,

1001
01:47:41.52 --> 01:47:48.64
probably not, I guess, but yeah, it was the first one where I was, where I was mentally really ready for that.

1002
01:47:48.64 --> 01:47:53.60
I think I was on a different, like, pole position, like I was at a different stage. And it,

1003
01:47:53.60 --> 01:48:00.32
it honestly, it meant more, you know, I was going to say with Andy, like, Andy, what may have been different

1004
01:48:00.32 --> 01:48:05.60
is that Andy was like, what is that saying about like, when the, when the student is ready, the

1005
01:48:05.60 --> 01:48:10.96
master will appear? Like, I don't know if you could have found someone that was more ready to like,

1006
01:48:10.96 --> 01:48:17.20
pick up this stuff and start going, you know? And so that's probably why it left an impression on you.

1007
01:48:17.20 --> 01:48:22.80
It damn sure left an impression on Andy, because this dude's totally obsessed, you know? So

1008
01:48:22.80 --> 01:48:27.52
and it's awesome. And you know what's funny about it? Well, Andy's freaking hilarious. You want

1009
01:48:27.52 --> 01:48:31.84
it like, yeah, when you talk about like, oh, Jocca, you make some good one minors hanging out. Like,

1010
01:48:31.84 --> 01:48:37.20
I can listen to Andy just all day long. And what's really funny to him to me is like, how he,

1011
01:48:38.80 --> 01:48:46.80
the way he handles, uh, uh, like, mistakes. His, he just hammers himself. He's so freaking hilarious.

1012
01:48:46.80 --> 01:48:52.56
He leaves no room for someone to make front of them. Because if, if you don't fire off within three

1013
01:48:52.56 --> 01:48:59.92
seconds, yeah, yeah, he's freaking classic classic. Yeah. And that's the kind of thing is when, you know,

1014
01:48:59.92 --> 01:49:06.32
when when you go out, it gives you a mission. Now you got your friends with you. You know, now you're like,

1015
01:49:06.32 --> 01:49:11.12
okay, cool. Now we're, and we're doing things like what you do in the seal teams. Guess what? If,

1016
01:49:11.12 --> 01:49:15.92
if Andy and I are on a pistol range and we're shooting together, like, he's going to be making

1017
01:49:15.92 --> 01:49:20.88
for me, right? I'm going to, I'm going to shank some round off or whatever. Need a mag change in the

1018
01:49:20.88 --> 01:49:24.96
middle of what I did need. I'm going to do something stupid. Yeah. And he's going to, it's going to,

1019
01:49:24.96 --> 01:49:28.64
it's going to be fun. And you know what? It's going to make me better. Yeah. It's going to make me better.

1020
01:49:29.04 --> 01:49:34.32
And that's another thing I noticed at tack like the amount of that's that we're up there. Yeah.

1021
01:49:34.32 --> 01:49:41.60
It's freaking awesome. It's awesome. And guys coming up to me and telling me like, bro, you know,

1022
01:49:41.60 --> 01:49:46.64
I started this. I started this. This is what I'm doing. And these are guys that freaking, you know,

1023
01:49:46.64 --> 01:49:51.68
two years ago, whatever when they got out of the Marine Corps after six years or after eight

1024
01:49:51.68 --> 01:49:57.84
years or after 18 years, they didn't have a mission anymore. And now the sun, they're freaking

1025
01:49:57.84 --> 01:50:03.68
jacked up. They got their gear on. They're showed me their freaking range finder and they're pumped,

1026
01:50:03.68 --> 01:50:11.44
man. They're pumped. Yep. And so the fact that you've sort of opened up this opportunity for so many

1027
01:50:11.44 --> 01:50:19.04
guys to start going down the path, it's, man, it's so beneficial to dudes. Yeah, that's freaking awesome.

1028
01:50:19.04 --> 01:50:24.64
And it's, there also comes a point in time where you want to like, I'm fortunate that I can pick

1029
01:50:24.64 --> 01:50:30.08
and choose what I'm doing right now. And so I really want to pick and choose things that's

1030
01:50:30.08 --> 01:50:36.000
rewarding to me. And hopefully that's not, you know, selfish. But there's also like,

1031
01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:43.76
I don't know, there's, there's people that I work with where I know this person could live on

1032
01:50:43.76 --> 01:50:50.80
this planet a lot longer because they have a new focus right now. And, you know, in artories

1033
01:50:50.80 --> 01:50:58.32
change their life totally. And what's cool about it is, you don't have to be in like perfect physical

1034
01:50:58.32 --> 01:51:02.72
shape too. So I mean, there's times where people get into artry and they're kind of a little bit

1035
01:51:02.72 --> 01:51:09.36
lost, you know, maybe, you know, maybe they're not as in shape as they were or whatever. But

1036
01:51:09.36 --> 01:51:15.20
that's what's cool about it. It's, it's not age specific. And it's, you know, if you can pull it back,

1037
01:51:15.20 --> 01:51:21.84
you can do it. And I think the natural progression is you pull it back and, you know, maybe you're

1038
01:51:21.84 --> 01:51:26.56
not good. And then you get a little better. And then, you know, there's a ton of people now that are

1039
01:51:26.56 --> 01:51:33.92
just for a better food source alternative, they're open-minded to hunting if it's, you know, in their

1040
01:51:33.92 --> 01:51:40.40
minds fair chase, which, you know, bow hunting, you know, kind of lowers that boundary for people

1041
01:51:40.40 --> 01:51:44.88
to where they're like, okay, if I'm going to put in all this work and do it, I'm totally cool,

1042
01:51:45.44 --> 01:51:51.12
you know, eating this thing or killing it or whatever. But then once you take that step, you realize,

1043
01:51:51.12 --> 01:51:58.64
oh, this is a whole different kind of hard because now you're dealing with, in my opinion, some

1044
01:51:58.64 --> 01:52:05.04
of the animals are just so much smarter than other things you could roll up on it, murt and, right?

1045
01:52:05.04 --> 01:52:14.000
I mean, they're freaking cute up, you know, because I remember, uh, Andy and I were on something

1046
01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:20.72
where it was, it was, it was a pretty tough, like, yeah, it was kind of a little bit of a miracle

1047
01:52:20.72 --> 01:52:27.60
that we pulled off this stock and jack something I don't know what it was, but I remember saying, like,

1048
01:52:27.60 --> 01:52:32.88
you know, doesn't seem like it'd be that hard to kill a person, he's just like, dude,

1049
01:52:33.84 --> 01:52:46.72
because it is not this hard at all. He's like, he goes, all of us would be, he's like, you know,

1050
01:52:46.72 --> 01:52:52.56
he's like, a lot of us would be, you know, at a totally different level if we had to learn this way first.

1051
01:52:52.56 --> 01:52:58.08
He's like, it, he goes, if, if everyone had this background prior to going into the team,

1052
01:52:58.08 --> 01:53:05.44
he's like, it would be, he would be insane. No, it'd be very beneficial, very beneficial.

1053
01:53:05.44 --> 01:53:09.36
There's so many things that you gotta think about that are the exact same, you know,

1054
01:53:09.36 --> 01:53:14.08
well, with elk, the only thing that's not the same without this smell, like, like,

1055
01:53:14.08 --> 01:53:20.40
and although if you talked to some of the Vietnam guys, they're like, oh, the VC or the NVA would smell you.

1056
01:53:20.40 --> 01:53:23.36
Yeah. And so if you can make it smell like that, and they could smell them, too.

1057
01:53:23.36 --> 01:53:25.76
Yeah. So maybe we need to just account for everything.

1058
01:53:25.76 --> 01:53:31.68
Well, now with dogs, like, what I told Andy was I said, listen, you know, if I knew there was someone

1059
01:53:31.68 --> 01:53:37.44
coming to jack me, you know, I would definitely have at least a dog, you know, I've definitely have

1060
01:53:37.44 --> 01:53:42.000
dogs around, because obviously dogs could smell too. You know, if you train them on something,

1061
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:48.24
you know, specific type of gear or something like that, it would be an advantage. But I've actually

1062
01:53:48.24 --> 01:53:56.64
talked to, well, one of the guys that we're with tonight, he's actually hooking me up with some of the

1063
01:53:56.64 --> 01:54:01.60
guys that are going to do some of the training down in Lenni for this sniper training.

1064
01:54:02.80 --> 01:54:07.84
They're doing a couple of team things there, and so he had asked me if I wanted to go down just to

1065
01:54:07.84 --> 01:54:16.000
to teach some navigation of like, instead of learning the long distance aspect to like make some

1066
01:54:16.72 --> 01:54:24.88
competitions on the closest shot to where they, you know, to where I would assess their choice of

1067
01:54:24.88 --> 01:54:30.48
that navigation and like what they could do different to where it's like, okay, we know how far you

1068
01:54:30.48 --> 01:54:36.40
can shoot something from now, you know, who can jack something at a guard or whatever, you know.

1069
01:54:36.40 --> 01:54:43.12
Yeah, it's totally different to have to get within, you know, 50 yards to something. That's just

1070
01:54:43.12 --> 01:54:49.76
freaking crazy. It's crazy to think that way. Whereas with a rifle, you know, you can be, I mean,

1071
01:54:50.64 --> 01:54:55.84
at least 500 yards, you can be 500 yards and be like, you know, we're good. I got this.

1072
01:54:57.04 --> 01:55:04.48
So we went surfing yesterday. At least, yeah, we went surfing yesterday. And I was 10

1073
01:55:04.48 --> 01:55:11.28
pause. Well, actually, no, I paused for a second to think to myself, did he surf or not? And the

1074
01:55:11.28 --> 01:55:16.32
fact, the matter is you did surf. You did surf. You paddled on the waves. You caught the waves and you

1075
01:55:16.32 --> 01:55:21.20
stood up. That's why I paused. It's like, wait, did he surf? Yes, you did. You caught multiple waves.

1076
01:55:21.20 --> 01:55:26.72
You paddled into them yourself. And then you stood up and rolled the waves. That's what surfing is.

1077
01:55:26.72 --> 01:55:32.08
So you did, we did surf yesterday. And I know you'd only been one other time, which was, the last time

1078
01:55:32.08 --> 01:55:38.64
you went was was a little bit more. At the pier. Yes, at the pier. And it's a, it's a much more

1079
01:55:38.64 --> 01:55:45.68
forgivable sort of like easier step. Like we were yesterday, that's like you can't push yourself

1080
01:55:45.68 --> 01:55:49.20
into those waves. You can't touch the bottom and be like, oh, I got this. You have to actually

1081
01:55:49.20 --> 01:55:54.000
surf. We're reserved yesterday. You actually have to surf. But when we were, when we were going out,

1082
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:59.52
who with Josh? And I was sort of like, you know, I'm just going to let Josh. Because like, I,

1083
01:55:59.52 --> 01:56:03.04
I don't want to, I didn't want to be telling you things and Josh telling you things and you're

1084
01:56:03.04 --> 01:56:07.44
sitting there, if we can got two people telling you shit to do and it just too much, right? So I was just

1085
01:56:07.44 --> 01:56:12.72
kind of do, I was just kind of going. And man, as I was going down, there was like,

1086
01:56:14.16 --> 01:56:18.08
before we even got in the water, there was 97 things I wanted to tell you, like, hey, man, you

1087
01:56:18.08 --> 01:56:21.92
got to watch out for this, this thing over here, this path over here, you got to watch here's the line

1088
01:56:21.92 --> 01:56:26.32
up. Here's where the, here's where the, the channels are like, this is where you want to sit. Here's

1089
01:56:26.32 --> 01:56:30.64
what you want to watch. I like, like, I'd 97 before we even got in the water. This before we got in the water.

1090
01:56:31.44 --> 01:56:40.24
And I'm not, you know, if you're at a, at a freaking black belt level in archery, like, I'm not,

1091
01:56:40.24 --> 01:56:45.68
that I'm not at that highest level of surfing. And I was like, man, imagine how many things were going

1092
01:56:45.68 --> 01:56:53.12
through your head. As you're watching me, like a freaking monkey with a damn bow just thinking,

1093
01:56:53.12 --> 01:56:59.84
all right, with a 50 foot surfboard. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it was just like the amount of things that

1094
01:56:59.84 --> 01:57:05.68
that that you don't know about surfing, the amount of things that I don't know about archery and

1095
01:57:05.68 --> 01:57:10.96
about hunting and about scent and about terrain and about the way the freaking animals react to this

1096
01:57:10.96 --> 01:57:17.84
and different animals react a different way. And there's like so much to learn. It's freaking crazy.

1097
01:57:17.84 --> 01:57:24.16
Yeah. It's crazy. It's hard as a coach because a lot of times you forget more than you,

1098
01:57:24.80 --> 01:57:31.12
like you don't know what you should be talking about until you realize like, oh, oh yeah.

1099
01:57:31.12 --> 01:57:36.80
And you gave me like, there was several of those yesterday. Yeah. Like, worst one was what you told me

1100
01:57:36.80 --> 01:57:42.40
when we were on the deck, like watching. We were like watching. You're like, yeah, I meant to tell you

1101
01:57:42.40 --> 01:57:48.80
when you were like, see how all the waves are coming in right there, like off that set. Like,

1102
01:57:48.80 --> 01:57:54.16
that's why Josh and I when we were done, we would go around those to like loop back and he's like,

1103
01:57:54.16 --> 01:57:58.56
you know, you just kept going straight back up the gut. Yeah. And he's like, I was just waiting for

1104
01:57:58.56 --> 01:58:05.76
that board to like freaking T-rex your face. I mean, while I'm like, bro, that would have been

1105
01:58:05.76 --> 01:58:10.88
something like when we were standing up on the top, looking down. If you would have said, like,

1106
01:58:10.88 --> 01:58:16.80
hey, you see how all those waves break like this. So when you get your set and you ride that out,

1107
01:58:17.36 --> 01:58:22.88
you know, looping behind that. So you're not like freaking how does full blown like do a bud's

1108
01:58:22.88 --> 01:58:28.96
training? Oh, there's a sacred moment. Freaking hand freaking like eight minutes. What I've

1109
01:58:28.96 --> 01:58:36.08
done with me, oh, he's an easy in the impact. Oh, just get hammered. But, but you did get up like

1110
01:58:36.08 --> 01:58:41.28
while we were surfing, you know, you did surf and and to me, that's a testament to, you know, like

1111
01:58:41.28 --> 01:58:48.08
being athletic and being being able to actually, you're really your first day out to go

1112
01:58:48.08 --> 01:58:53.92
paddle into waves and stand up. That's not easy to do. Now, Josh Hall did make you a freaking

1113
01:58:54.56 --> 01:59:05.28
basically an aircraft carrier of course. It's freaking massive. 11, 6 and it's like over four inches thick

1114
01:59:05.28 --> 01:59:11.68
and 24 inches, which anyone that's a surfers here in these numbers going damn, that is an actual

1115
01:59:11.68 --> 01:59:17.52
aircraft carrier. But that's what a perfect platform. And plus you're how much do you weigh?

1116
01:59:17.52 --> 01:59:22.56
240. Oh, yeah. Like that's a different level. You need a big ass board. And it looks like

1117
01:59:22.56 --> 01:59:28.08
you echo Charles. Yes, sir. What's up with your surfing career? Oh, minimal at best.

1118
01:59:28.08 --> 01:59:35.76
We'll say. How come? I don't know. There's no tangible reason. I mean, I guess if I search my

1119
01:59:35.76 --> 01:59:42.16
soul, you know, I did body boarding sponging as it was punching, you know, for the most of my

1120
01:59:42.80 --> 01:59:48.96
adolescent life. And then, yeah, how did you not, but how did you not, like, say, oh, wouldn't it be

1121
01:59:48.96 --> 01:59:54.16
cool to stand up on this thing and ride this wave and glide through the ocean?

1122
01:59:54.16 --> 02:00:00.72
Yeah. I don't know. It's just one of the things. You know, like, where I grew up on the

1123
02:00:00.72 --> 02:00:05.84
south side of Kauai, they're actually not there's surfing, but I grew up at the beach, like,

1124
02:00:05.84 --> 02:00:10.88
literally grew up at the beach. And then again, you're saying this, like, this is some sort of a

1125
02:00:10.88 --> 02:00:16.08
weird way that you wouldn't be surfing. But you're like, no, no, no, I grew up at the beach. No,

1126
02:00:16.08 --> 02:00:21.60
exactly. But if you're wrong with you, if you understand the progression, just naturally

1127
02:00:21.60 --> 02:00:25.68
kind of growing up there, you go, you're swimming, you know, in the baby pond at Playable Beach.

1128
02:00:25.68 --> 02:00:29.20
And then you're like, okay, then you're kind of body surfing a little bit, then you're

1129
02:00:29.20 --> 02:00:34.96
booky boarding body boarding sponging, you know, also that. And then, yeah, it's exactly, I think you

1130
02:00:34.96 --> 02:00:41.20
start to go surfing. And there's a, there's a, how should I say, a geographical element to it as well.

1131
02:00:41.20 --> 02:00:45.20
You're literally in the baby pond, then you're outside the baby pond. And then the surfing

1132
02:00:45.20 --> 02:00:50.000
waves and the surfing spots, those are out. So you always see the surfers, but they're way out.

1133
02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:55.28
So I get maybe I think when we started getting into football and stuff, it's like the beach

1134
02:00:55.28 --> 02:01:00.64
started to be less and less. And then we just never, I don't know what I never did.

1135
02:01:00.64 --> 02:01:05.12
Are you thinking if I get an investment for a second? Yeah, step. So like, you're going to have to

1136
02:01:05.12 --> 02:01:10.16
get out, like you said it, where you want to be as a little bit further out. You know, that's where

1137
02:01:10.16 --> 02:01:17.92
the good stuff is. It's best to crush and all her work out like 45 minutes before you first

1138
02:01:17.92 --> 02:01:22.72
day. Yeah. Well, that was interesting, too. So like we get in the water.

1139
02:01:22.72 --> 02:01:28.64
What have been surfing before? Right. Yeah, never. No, but I'm, I was, like, I'm talking to

1140
02:01:28.64 --> 02:01:33.60
Doug and I'm like, bro, I've been on hunts with him. Like, I'm watching him move through the forest.

1141
02:01:33.60 --> 02:01:39.60
And he's just like, you know, freaking 14 foot legs. And he's just stepping over, like,

1142
02:01:39.60 --> 02:01:44.24
he's stepping over small, like, yeah, like small trees and stuff like this. And I'm,

1143
02:01:44.24 --> 02:01:48.80
I'm like, dude, you know, and then watching him shoot, I'm watching him shoot a ton and then like

1144
02:01:48.80 --> 02:01:53.20
hook a football or whatever. I'm like, yeah, this guy's a great athlete. And so I'm thinking,

1145
02:01:53.20 --> 02:01:56.80
we're going surfing and I'm like, okay, you know, he, and I said, man, you're going, I was,

1146
02:01:56.80 --> 02:02:00.72
I told you this. I go, bro, if you're long arms, you're going to just be like, bro, and this

1147
02:02:00.72 --> 02:02:05.20
big board, you're going to be, you're going to be like a freaking, you know, a cigarette boat,

1148
02:02:05.20 --> 02:02:10.24
just going through the water. So we'd go in and I, like I said, I wasn't doing any coaching.

1149
02:02:10.24 --> 02:02:14.64
I was just kind of leaving that Josh and I get in the water and I start paddling out and then

1150
02:02:15.44 --> 02:02:19.36
I look back because Doug was going next and then Josh was doing sort of like cleanup, right?

1151
02:02:19.36 --> 02:02:23.76
In case something went sideways and they're probably going to get in. So then I see Doug, like,

1152
02:02:23.76 --> 02:02:28.64
okay, he's good. He's in and then I start paddling and I'm not like racing, but I'm just paddling out.

1153
02:02:28.64 --> 02:02:32.16
But then Josh comes up next to me and I'm like, well, that's weird. I want to wear

1154
02:02:32.16 --> 02:02:36.88
dudas. So I'm paddling a little bit more and I look back. So now it's been like probably

1155
02:02:36.88 --> 02:02:43.60
one minute and 30 seconds. Maybe I look back and as soon as I look back, I see Doug and he looks like

1156
02:02:43.60 --> 02:02:52.88
he's just like, they got into a freshly natural repair. Like, oh, yeah, because here's the thing.

1157
02:02:52.88 --> 02:02:57.84
And you brought this up to me a long time ago, echo Charles. If you're not used to it,

1158
02:02:57.84 --> 02:03:02.24
that's like, if you're not used to it, it doesn't matter. Look, it matters and if you'd

1159
02:03:02.24 --> 02:03:07.20
weren't in good shape at all, then it would really suck. Yeah. But if you're not used to that

1160
02:03:07.20 --> 02:03:13.52
little particular muscle group and the technique, because you're in the water and there's balance

1161
02:03:13.52 --> 02:03:20.48
going on and yeah, it takes a little bit. Yeah, they're true. I mean, I was laughing at myself because

1162
02:03:21.60 --> 02:03:28.96
well, first off, I didn't know like where we were going, because we were, we were, you're going to

1163
02:03:28.96 --> 02:03:33.52
be surfing sets, right? That would further out. You know, I don't know where it was, probably

1164
02:03:33.52 --> 02:03:40.80
won't say, because I know you have your spots. But so my first experience was we walked out from the

1165
02:03:40.80 --> 02:03:47.52
pier and like where stuff was breaking right there. That's where I was surfing. So when he kind of

1166
02:03:47.52 --> 02:03:53.20
jumped off the rock and went out there a ways and I was talking to Josh and Josh, like, yeah,

1167
02:03:53.20 --> 02:03:57.76
just get where you're comfortable and launch out on your board. You know, wait for a smooth spot and

1168
02:03:57.76 --> 02:04:04.72
jump out. So when I did that by that point, Jocca was like 100 yards out. So I thought like,

1169
02:04:05.44 --> 02:04:11.60
he's where we were going to be waiting for these waves. So I just went like full sprint for like the

1170
02:04:11.60 --> 02:04:17.20
first 30 seconds and then Josh, like, as I'm like kind of starting to burn out, you know,

1171
02:04:17.20 --> 02:04:24.08
that freaking Josh is like strokes by and there just go and then Jocca was just looking back. He's like,

1172
02:04:24.08 --> 02:04:30.16
got to go about 200 more yards and I was just thinking like, for MD. Like,

1173
02:04:31.20 --> 02:04:35.28
for, bro, I was going into like, I was, I was saying this kind of stuff like, bro, you got to

1174
02:04:35.28 --> 02:04:41.20
give me like two minutes of hard pattern. I was in that moment. You know, like two minutes and it's

1175
02:04:41.20 --> 02:04:45.04
over. It's a kind of out because you were just kind of in the lineup, like not going to start

1176
02:04:45.04 --> 02:04:49.76
using the impacts of the reason. And all of a sudden, there's a wall and I'm like, because now

1177
02:04:49.76 --> 02:04:54.32
I'm reading now, I put everything together by my mind. And I'm thinking if this, if this brother

1178
02:04:54.32 --> 02:05:00.40
doesn't get out there, like now he's going to be in here for a long time. So I'm like, you got to

1179
02:05:00.40 --> 02:05:06.80
give me like two minutes. Give me like two minutes of work. It was, I put, see, I love like, I love

1180
02:05:06.80 --> 02:05:16.000
that. I love something that, you know, it's just to me struggle gives you, it like gives you a purpose.

1181
02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:20.16
You know, today, when we were waiting to come here, I just sat out there and watched those things.

1182
02:05:20.16 --> 02:05:26.40
And I was like thinking about every mistake I made yesterday and how I would do it differently today.

1183
02:05:26.40 --> 02:05:31.60
Paddling was one of them. But like, even yesterday,

1184
02:05:32.48 --> 02:05:37.20
Choc has like, hey dude, you know, just hit the garage where you work out. So I went down in there and

1185
02:05:37.20 --> 02:05:42.88
it's very different than mine. You know, so I'm kind of looking around, looking at the, you know,

1186
02:05:42.88 --> 02:05:49.52
the tools trying to figure out like what I can construct, you know, that day. So I freaking, you know,

1187
02:05:49.52 --> 02:05:55.60
hit his rings for a while and stuff and and did some kettlebells. But then I also thought like,

1188
02:05:55.60 --> 02:06:04.000
you know, a lot of it's like freaking gorilla movements. So he, you know, his wife and girls had some

1189
02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:11.04
bands over on the side. So after I, you know, slung some kettlebells around for a while, I, you know,

1190
02:06:11.04 --> 02:06:16.72
went and grabbed some bands and just did some like burnouts of, you know, shoulders and, you know,

1191
02:06:16.72 --> 02:06:22.40
freaking arms and stuff, which I thought was, you know, I worked out for an hour. I was pretty

1192
02:06:22.40 --> 02:06:30.96
happy with, you know, everything. But like, dude, at like 100 yards out, freaking trying to

1193
02:06:30.96 --> 02:06:37.60
paddle that aircraft carrier. And he's like, 200 yards building, you got it. And I was just like,

1194
02:06:37.60 --> 02:06:42.80
oh, like, freaking dry sets. You know what I said, you later, we got back. He's like, he's like,

1195
02:06:42.80 --> 02:06:47.36
yeah, you know, bro, I mean, I just realized for the first time that like when you see a surfer,

1196
02:06:47.36 --> 02:06:52.32
that guy's in like better shape than a wrestler like he's in sick. You got to be in the sick

1197
02:06:52.32 --> 02:06:57.92
ishap because that's how hard it was. In a way, but also not a way, let's face it. You can be like a

1198
02:06:57.92 --> 02:07:02.88
fat old dude that serves like I'll take you to, yeah, they're just used to and they got good

1199
02:07:02.88 --> 02:07:06.40
technique and they just go out there and they don't even, you know, they don't even freaking try

1200
02:07:06.40 --> 02:07:11.44
in there. I was like, when I give a bodybuilder, you know, a bow and watch him like,

1201
02:07:11.44 --> 02:07:17.68
struggle to get it back and you're like, dude, this is a 70 pound dumbbell row right now. And you

1202
02:07:17.68 --> 02:07:23.04
can't do it. You know, and then because, yeah, is that that they don't have like the, the little

1203
02:07:23.04 --> 02:07:28.32
stabilizer muscles or something? It's like, no, it's just like, it's just the understanding of like

1204
02:07:28.32 --> 02:07:33.44
the technique of like where you're pushing and pulling and like the leverage of it. It'd be like,

1205
02:07:33.44 --> 02:07:38.32
you know, it'd be just like walking up and even if a big dude, you said like, you know,

1206
02:07:38.32 --> 02:07:42.88
hey, do a clean and jerk and you just like put 200 pounds on there. You do, I mean, it's just going to be a

1207
02:07:42.88 --> 02:07:48.72
train. Right. They don't have the technique. Whereas you get a little female that knows how to do a clean

1208
02:07:48.72 --> 02:07:53.20
and jerk. Yeah. She'll take that 200 and throw it up like it's nothing. I'll be talked about that on the

1209
02:07:53.20 --> 02:07:59.36
maze today. We're talking about that. What the swinging one? Yeah, the big maze. Yeah, that for surfing,

1210
02:07:59.36 --> 02:08:03.04
yeah, you're right. Like actually, you don't have to be in that good shape. You just have to be

1211
02:08:03.04 --> 02:08:08.48
used to because it's so repetitive. Like just patdling it so repetitive. It's like not knowing how to

1212
02:08:08.48 --> 02:08:16.48
swim. Honestly, like on that board, I just felt like, you know, the first time, even if someone

1213
02:08:16.48 --> 02:08:20.24
knows how to swim, you throw them in the water. If they don't know like stroke and like how to

1214
02:08:20.24 --> 02:08:24.40
block and breathe and you're like taking on water in your mouth and you're like trying to blow

1215
02:08:24.40 --> 02:08:30.64
that out and yeah, you know, you're freaking sprinting when there's waves up like and it was like

1216
02:08:30.64 --> 02:08:36.08
simple stuff. You know, I got my first ride in. I think I was on my like I went up to one,

1217
02:08:36.08 --> 02:08:41.12
you know, one then got up to one foot for a little bit and then like as I'm going back out, I'm just,

1218
02:08:41.12 --> 02:08:47.92
you know, taking freaking, taking the straight line straight out and I did that a couple times

1219
02:08:49.04 --> 02:08:55.20
and then I'm out there with Josh. And Joshua would rode one in. I'm out there with Josh in a couple,

1220
02:08:55.20 --> 02:09:01.04
like a big set came that were crashing kind of further out and like as we're going up, he knew it was

1221
02:09:01.04 --> 02:09:06.48
going to like crash and he goes, he goes, bro, when you go up, he goes, do a push up on your board.

1222
02:09:06.48 --> 02:09:10.24
Right as you're hitting the right as you're hitting, you know, whatever you call it, you know, the

1223
02:09:10.24 --> 02:09:14.40
flake or what do I want? Yeah, he's like, you know, do a push up on your board and then it drives

1224
02:09:14.40 --> 02:09:18.80
and goes down and you can just ride the back and I like that freaking wind up this thing. It was like

1225
02:09:18.80 --> 02:09:26.64
and rode down and I'm just like, now you tell me dude, I freaking was taken like full endos,

1226
02:09:26.64 --> 02:09:34.16
just freaking one after another in the freaking mortar zone, just taking heavy artillery,

1227
02:09:34.16 --> 02:09:39.52
Josh going Josh or just out there like, watch me just like, you know, he'll be back, he'll be back

1228
02:09:39.52 --> 02:09:49.60
out here 15 or whatever. There's a lot of technique. Man, he told me the, you know, the buttonhook method,

1229
02:09:49.60 --> 02:09:55.36
the channels. Yeah, like, once the channel, we got all the way out and climbed up on the rocks and

1230
02:09:55.36 --> 02:10:01.44
we were there to take a picture of the three of us like up at the top of the cliffs and he goes,

1231
02:10:02.32 --> 02:10:07.20
see where all those are breaking, he's like, yeah, that's how it allows you. He goes, that's why

1232
02:10:07.20 --> 02:10:12.08
I like, I'd ride it out this way and then I'd come in around the back and then Josh, you know,

1233
02:10:12.08 --> 02:10:16.08
how Josh always rode out that way and then he'd come around the back and he's like, you just kept going

1234
02:10:16.08 --> 02:10:24.24
right up the minute. I was like, man, you think you've tell me that like 10 minutes in,

1235
02:10:24.24 --> 02:10:31.12
it's another time. You know what? As you said, there's like only so many things, like the 97 things

1236
02:10:31.12 --> 02:10:36.96
that I wanted to tell you or that Josh wanted to tell you? Yeah, that just didn't make the chart yet.

1237
02:10:36.96 --> 02:10:40.72
And then once you once we realized that, okay, he's going to be able to survive, then that made it

1238
02:10:40.72 --> 02:10:45.76
onto the freaking, onto the prioritize and execute things. Don't just sit there in the impact zone and try to

1239
02:10:45.76 --> 02:10:54.88
pat it out. Um, hey, so I'm going back to the business side of things because again, to me,

1240
02:10:54.88 --> 02:10:59.44
that's one of the, that's what makes it's applicable. Well, that's what makes your story applicable

1241
02:10:59.44 --> 02:11:04.56
in so many different realms is the, the business side and the way you've set things up.

1242
02:11:04.56 --> 02:11:11.52
You ended up eventually kind of like, I don't know if this was your, your final move,

1243
02:11:11.52 --> 02:11:16.72
but not it's not your final move, but your one of your biggest moves was partnering up with with PSE.

1244
02:11:18.24 --> 02:11:22.80
Yeah, I mean, that definitely came later, but yeah, I mean, there came a point where

1245
02:11:23.92 --> 02:11:31.52
our business had grown a really awesome community that was, you know, thriving for the educational

1246
02:11:31.52 --> 02:11:38.40
content and then also like products that supported that educational content, which was all, you know,

1247
02:11:38.40 --> 02:11:44.24
Sharon's side of the house. I was more, you know, I come up with things to talk about based on

1248
02:11:44.24 --> 02:11:51.36
someone I'm working with at that time, but yeah, the brand became a community, you know, it became,

1249
02:11:51.36 --> 02:11:56.72
you know, Sharon always said like, we're not, you know, we don't have fans, we have, you know,

1250
02:11:56.72 --> 02:12:02.000
we have a community like we have, you know, we have a knock on nation. That's kind of what we

1251
02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:08.32
referred to it probably five years ago, you know, five or six years ago, which we just turned 10 years old.

1252
02:12:09.28 --> 02:12:14.40
So, you know, halfway through we realized, you know, like what really fit our model.

1253
02:12:15.60 --> 02:12:22.48
And then yeah, one of the hard things for me, one of the hardest things is, you know, I'm a very

1254
02:12:22.48 --> 02:12:29.68
loyal person, you know, and I've since I've also been, I've worked internally at manufacturers,

1255
02:12:30.48 --> 02:12:38.88
I look at, you know, ambassadors or external representatives in a different light than, you know,

1256
02:12:38.88 --> 02:12:44.72
if someone just outbearing an ambassador, you know, or public figure, whatever, whatever, you know,

1257
02:12:44.72 --> 02:12:52.24
it's way different now. But when I was internal and we had pro staff, you know, you just,

1258
02:12:52.24 --> 02:12:59.52
you see what people do that really helps the company and makes you like never in question of

1259
02:13:00.24 --> 02:13:06.32
should we get, you know, who are we going to keep around this year? I just knew those types of things,

1260
02:13:06.32 --> 02:13:13.20
you know, to where if it was, it's just like with for me, like with my friendships,

1261
02:13:13.20 --> 02:13:19.60
if it's a two-way street, then, you know, that's a good relationship. But if it's all, if it's always like,

1262
02:13:19.60 --> 02:13:25.12
you know, there's always a given a take, then, you know, that's just not like a healthy relationship.

1263
02:13:25.12 --> 02:13:29.76
So, from like, like you built me a bow, you taught me how to shoot, you took me on Hanson,

1264
02:13:29.76 --> 02:13:34.72
and then I broke your neck. That's a good relationship. Yeah, that's how I'm looking for it.

1265
02:13:34.72 --> 02:13:41.04
That's exactly what I'm looking for. Yeah, a lot of people don't know that like,

1266
02:13:41.04 --> 02:13:47.28
when you are here doing the podcast with Andy and Trevor, that was day one of jujitsu for me.

1267
02:13:48.32 --> 02:13:54.96
And I was actually in this room. I just couldn't talk because my neck was broken. I was over in that corner,

1268
02:13:54.96 --> 02:14:01.84
just trying to get oxygen, freaking pull my ass off his off the back, neck bone.

1269
02:14:03.68 --> 02:14:06.40
Meanwhile, you and Andy are just frigging laughing. You're laughing.

1270
02:14:06.40 --> 02:14:14.10
Okay. I'm just like, okay. It's your little thing. Yeah, it's all right. So, we form these really good relationships with the two

1271
02:14:14.10 --> 02:14:21.38
waste street, just like you and I got. Yeah, and so it's always been tough when, when you change, you know,

1272
02:14:21.38 --> 02:14:27.54
when you, if you change brands because I don't ever want it to be a reflection of loyalty but a lot of times,

1273
02:14:27.54 --> 02:14:35.06
A lot of times like the higher up you go in what you're giving someone or what they're

1274
02:14:35.06 --> 02:14:36.06
giving you.

1275
02:14:36.06 --> 02:14:41.22
There's obviously there's just more expectation and there's more, you know, I don't

1276
02:14:41.22 --> 02:14:44.18
know, it's just like the higher up and rank you go.

1277
02:14:44.18 --> 02:14:50.06
There's, you know, there's things that you need to do better than other people.

1278
02:14:50.06 --> 02:14:54.26
And so, you know, when you climb to that spot, it's, sometimes it's hard when you get to

1279
02:14:54.26 --> 02:14:59.30
a higher level to then change because I don't ever want it to people to feel like I'm

1280
02:14:59.30 --> 02:15:04.66
just making a change from a monetary point of view.

1281
02:15:04.66 --> 02:15:14.18
But for me, I had gone through two consecutive contracts that were multi-year contracts

1282
02:15:14.18 --> 02:15:21.26
and both of them kind of got cut when our business is projecting, you know, in this format,

1283
02:15:21.26 --> 02:15:25.66
but then, you know, they're like, well, you know, we're kind of plateauing from a marketing

1284
02:15:25.66 --> 02:15:30.06
point of view and, you know, we're not getting added budgets, but we need to make room for

1285
02:15:30.06 --> 02:15:31.06
other things.

1286
02:15:31.06 --> 02:15:36.06
So they were always transparent, but it also became clear of, you know, we're

1287
02:15:36.06 --> 02:15:41.26
projecting up and I want to, I want to provide more free content, but I can't provide

1288
02:15:41.26 --> 02:15:46.26
free content to the consumer if I have no support from, you know.

1289
02:15:46.26 --> 02:15:53.46
By the way, when you say your trajectory is going up, you mean not on archery is growing,

1290
02:15:53.46 --> 02:15:56.56
you're getting more and more people following, there are more people watching your

1291
02:15:56.56 --> 02:15:58.06
instructional on YouTube.

1292
02:15:58.06 --> 02:16:04.34
There's just a whole new archery pie, like, you know, people within the archery community,

1293
02:16:04.34 --> 02:16:09.38
that pie would be like, you know, local surfers around here probably, you know, that's probably

1294
02:16:09.38 --> 02:16:11.26
a pie.

1295
02:16:11.26 --> 02:16:17.02
Because if someone just really started focusing on, you know, teaching surfing to people

1296
02:16:17.02 --> 02:16:23.14
like me, you know, and I came in, they like start this whole other thing to where these

1297
02:16:23.14 --> 02:16:26.82
people all over here are probably looking at like, what's this guy even doing?

1298
02:16:26.82 --> 02:16:28.66
You know, why is he doing that?

1299
02:16:28.66 --> 02:16:34.06
The reality is, you know, we're kind of like baking a whole new cake because the people

1300
02:16:34.06 --> 02:16:38.98
that we're getting from the military and, you know, the people that we get from a lot

1301
02:16:38.98 --> 02:16:40.38
of our mutual friends.

1302
02:16:40.38 --> 02:16:47.14
Like I'm beyond busy just with our, just with people that we know should be getting an

1303
02:16:47.14 --> 02:16:48.14
archery, right?

1304
02:16:48.14 --> 02:16:58.14
And at the end of that contract, my last one, I kind of knew I need to open my ears to

1305
02:16:58.14 --> 02:17:04.70
everybody because I had been with that company for 10 straight years, but I also had taken

1306
02:17:04.70 --> 02:17:11.18
six years of, you know, to where things were plateauing and I could see there wasn't progression.

1307
02:17:11.18 --> 02:17:16.78
So I listened to everybody and yeah, I mean, through everything, there was honestly there

1308
02:17:16.78 --> 02:17:23.26
was multiple deals that were better than where I was, but PSE came in and pretty much

1309
02:17:23.26 --> 02:17:28.06
said like, we love what you're doing and we want into support what we're doing, but we

1310
02:17:28.06 --> 02:17:32.86
also want to give you the tools to where if you want to do more, we'll give you the tools

1311
02:17:32.86 --> 02:17:37.74
for that. So they said, you know, if you feel like you want to create a bow that's specific

1312
02:17:37.74 --> 02:17:42.78
to, you know, to your followers or if you want to do something and I said, well, you know,

1313
02:17:42.78 --> 02:17:47.98
can I bring in a bow that's like at a budget price, you know, and they just said, yeah,

1314
02:17:47.98 --> 02:17:52.38
you tell us what you want it to sell for, you know, we'll assign an engineer to you and you

1315
02:17:52.38 --> 02:18:00.38
can, you know, you can do whatever you want. So it was just, it was just a different door,

1316
02:18:00.38 --> 02:18:08.62
you know, that got opened that allowed us to go a direction with our brand that I feel good about

1317
02:18:08.62 --> 02:18:14.38
and I feel like, you know, I sleep well with just knowing that we're giving back a lot.

1318
02:18:15.10 --> 02:18:20.78
And yeah, PSE's been a huge part of that, you know, they've just given me the tools, you know,

1319
02:18:20.78 --> 02:18:26.86
the first bow we came out with is the one you and I shoot and then came out with another bow

1320
02:18:26.86 --> 02:18:33.50
that was focused on, you know, a price to where either average person can go and get into archery

1321
02:18:33.50 --> 02:18:39.02
with a really good set up, but probably still less than what you could buy a surfboard for, you know,

1322
02:18:39.02 --> 02:18:46.06
I mean, and then yeah, we can choose our direction. So it's been an awesome partnership and,

1323
02:18:46.78 --> 02:18:51.34
you know, there are an America, you know, everything's made in America for the stuff that,

1324
02:18:51.34 --> 02:18:57.10
you know, we're designing and it's just, it's really cool because it's actually the company.

1325
02:18:57.10 --> 02:19:03.50
My first bow was a PSE and last year was their 50 year, like anniversary.

1326
02:19:04.22 --> 02:19:12.70
So, and PSE started in Illinois, like very close to where that road that I turned down was not very far

1327
02:19:12.70 --> 02:19:17.26
from there. So there's just a lot of cool things like that that, you know, a lot of times

1328
02:19:17.26 --> 02:19:23.82
if things are meant to be, they happen, you know, I've just learned that, you know, if you

1329
02:19:23.82 --> 02:19:31.26
for stuff, it's not for the right reasons. So I've, I've just really, I've been fortunate that I haven't

1330
02:19:31.26 --> 02:19:35.82
had to make a decision based on, like, I can't pay my bills if I make this decision.

1331
02:19:36.70 --> 02:19:43.26
So I've always just let things unfold of, you know, really what's meant to be will be, and, you know,

1332
02:19:43.26 --> 02:19:51.74
and I feel like I feel like my progression of shooting tournament archery and learning what I learned

1333
02:19:51.74 --> 02:19:57.42
there and learning the connections and growing up, working with the manufacturer and seeing some

1334
02:19:57.42 --> 02:20:04.06
of that behind the scenes stuff. Like all those were just sacrifices and building blocks that I had

1335
02:20:04.06 --> 02:20:09.90
to do to get to where I really want to be. You know, I never, I never wanted to be the best

1336
02:20:09.90 --> 02:20:15.18
tournament archer and never really wanted to be, you know, I didn't want to just work at an archery

1337
02:20:15.74 --> 02:20:22.78
you know, manufacturer or, you know, go to all the, the shoots. I just, I love hunting. I love

1338
02:20:22.78 --> 02:20:28.38
teaching, you know, I like, I like going to new spots and seeing new things and having new challenges.

1339
02:20:28.38 --> 02:20:33.90
So, you know, that's kind of what it's done for me. Yeah. And what I like about it and I remember

1340
02:20:33.90 --> 02:20:37.58
as this deal was unfolding. You were telling me what it was like and it's like, it's a true partnership.

1341
02:20:37.58 --> 02:20:44.22
Like you said, you're allowed to go in there. You can help design exactly what it is you want.

1342
02:20:44.22 --> 02:20:51.34
It's your name going on these on this equipment. So it's like you can't be any more invested

1343
02:20:51.34 --> 02:20:56.70
in this company, which is, which is awesome. Yeah. And what the other thing too is

1344
02:20:57.82 --> 02:21:03.90
everyone needs to remember, you know, if you can't shoot it well, there's no purpose to it. So like

1345
02:21:03.90 --> 02:21:09.58
through that whole process, I got equipment from all these companies that I really hadn't done,

1346
02:21:11.10 --> 02:21:16.54
hadn't done a lot of due diligence shooting to where I, you know, because I had only shot

1347
02:21:16.54 --> 02:21:22.22
two other archery brands really at from a like professional level, each one for about a decade.

1348
02:21:22.22 --> 02:21:28.78
So I shot other competitors to know what they felt like, but that doesn't mean I knew what they

1349
02:21:28.78 --> 02:21:36.30
would do like in my hands every day. So I needed to know that. And right away after three or four

1350
02:21:36.30 --> 02:21:45.02
days, I thought this is a seriously underrated product, you know, and I went out there and met with them

1351
02:21:45.02 --> 02:21:50.46
and they talked about a lot of things that they wanted to do, especially like at that 50 year,

1352
02:21:50.46 --> 02:21:55.98
you know, they wanted to, you know, make some changes from the sales point of view. They wanted

1353
02:21:55.98 --> 02:22:00.94
to make some marketing decisions that were different, you know, they said, you know, we want to be

1354
02:22:00.94 --> 02:22:08.06
able to to hit some like niche markets, which for them our community was a niche market, which I think

1355
02:22:08.06 --> 02:22:14.46
was very underrated, you know, now now I think they realized, you know, what the impact is.

1356
02:22:16.30 --> 02:22:23.26
But yeah, it really gave the ability for me to take people that had incredible ideas internally

1357
02:22:23.26 --> 02:22:29.98
and in awesome patents, which, you know, for me would be hard to go out on my own and do it

1358
02:22:31.10 --> 02:22:37.18
because I'd have to work around so many things that now that I've shot their bows, I personally like.

1359
02:22:37.18 --> 02:22:45.10
So, you know, I would be trying to figure out a way around what they've solidified as a, you know,

1360
02:22:45.10 --> 02:22:51.82
as a proven design. So it just, it was a, for me, it was a plug-in play. Like, and that's what,

1361
02:22:51.82 --> 02:23:00.62
it had to be because, you know, we've worked really hard, Sharon and I, to, you know, really

1362
02:23:01.34 --> 02:23:07.34
stay on our path at knock on our tree because there's, there's been a lot of opportunities to, you know,

1363
02:23:07.34 --> 02:23:13.66
maybe, I don't know if sell out would be like the term because it probably wouldn't be that drastic,

1364
02:23:13.66 --> 02:23:20.46
but we could have definitely made a lot more decisions that would have put our following secondary

1365
02:23:20.46 --> 02:23:30.78
to decisions that we made and the PSE collaboration was a, was an awesome plug-in play for us.

1366
02:23:31.66 --> 02:23:39.10
And I think as a, especially me, I feel like I was an athlete that built a career out of

1367
02:23:40.54 --> 02:23:49.26
the discipline of athletics, honestly. I feel like those are the little things in business, you know,

1368
02:23:49.26 --> 02:23:56.14
especially now, like so many people build business based off social media or, you know, maybe they've,

1369
02:23:57.10 --> 02:24:01.82
you know, maybe they've been with the origin for, you know, using your guise for a year.

1370
02:24:01.82 --> 02:24:07.82
And you guys have been good to them and you're laying down foundation to get to where you

1371
02:24:07.82 --> 02:24:13.90
want an origin to go, but then, you know, brand Y comes in and says, well, you know, we're not just

1372
02:24:13.90 --> 02:24:19.98
going to give you a discount on a guise, we'll give you a guise. And, you know, I was always at the,

1373
02:24:20.38 --> 02:24:28.22
the mindset of, okay, if I get a guise to it, one, do I really need to get a free guise, if I've got one,

1374
02:24:28.22 --> 02:24:35.18
even though I had to buy it for moregen, you know, and okay, let's say I take the free guise.

1375
02:24:35.18 --> 02:24:41.74
Well, now I've, like, also started a brand new relationship. So, you know, I think we made a lot of

1376
02:24:41.74 --> 02:24:50.14
really good choices by weighing out, like, long-term relationships that understood the direction

1377
02:24:50.14 --> 02:24:55.42
we needed to go, but we weren't there yet, but they were going to help at a rate that they could

1378
02:24:55.42 --> 02:25:02.62
to where we could get to our goal versus, like, you know, a lot of startups or the perfect example of,

1379
02:25:02.62 --> 02:25:09.42
like, you know, they make a lot of dumb decisions as I did as a business, you know, given stuff

1380
02:25:09.42 --> 02:25:14.62
away to the wrong people, and those, those places come and go all the time, and I think as like an

1381
02:25:14.62 --> 02:25:20.70
and, you know, an ambassador type figure, whatever, you can, I think you can be like the

1382
02:25:20.70 --> 02:25:26.78
call me influencers. That's where hashtag influencer. Yeah, which, yeah, that's your official hashtag

1383
02:25:26.78 --> 02:25:34.62
for any night. But, yeah, you can, you know, you can burn a lot of bridges, and it's just my experience

1384
02:25:34.62 --> 02:25:43.66
that a lot of these, you know, jujitsu, surfing, archery, they're like, they're small demographics,

1385
02:25:43.66 --> 02:25:49.58
they're like small ecosystems. So, it's like, there's only so many times you can burn a hole in the

1386
02:25:49.58 --> 02:25:55.34
freaking ozone before, eventually, people are like, that dude just burn in the planet down, if, you know,

1387
02:25:56.06 --> 02:26:00.46
yeah. What I like about you, what you guys, what you and Sharon have done,

1388
02:26:00.46 --> 02:26:06.22
and I think this might be the biggest lesson that I look at you to try and pass on to the people.

1389
02:26:07.10 --> 02:26:11.34
As you guys have done the right things for the right reasons a little time. You have put the

1390
02:26:11.34 --> 02:26:15.98
customer first, you put the clients first, you put the people that are watching your videos.

1391
02:26:16.62 --> 02:26:20.62
I mean, there's, there's, well, that's what you've done. That's what you've stuck to,

1392
02:26:20.62 --> 02:26:24.94
making the best products you can, trying to get them at a good price point. I mean, for you to go to

1393
02:26:24.94 --> 02:26:30.86
PSE and like say, okay, I could make one their bow, you know, and this super high end bow,

1394
02:26:31.74 --> 02:26:36.06
but you went there and the first really, I guess the second movie made, because you did make that

1395
02:26:36.06 --> 02:26:39.66
first bow that we're shooting, but then you said, okay, here's the first move. We're going to make a bow

1396
02:26:39.66 --> 02:26:46.94
that is affordable to people that still kicks ass. So, I think one of the lessons that I take away from

1397
02:26:46.94 --> 02:26:52.54
this is like, if you're doing the right things for the right reasons, in the long run, strategically,

1398
02:26:52.54 --> 02:26:57.26
you're going to be better off than, you know, trying to, trying to maneuver real quick to make a

1399
02:26:57.26 --> 02:27:01.42
little bit of a buck here in a buck there. Like you said, you're burning a hole in the world that

1400
02:27:01.42 --> 02:27:09.98
that you have to live in and it ends up not working out well. I hate to ask you this, because

1401
02:27:09.98 --> 02:27:15.10
I've, you probably been asked this 10,000 times, but look, we've been going for two and a half hours or

1402
02:27:15.10 --> 02:27:20.38
something like that. But if someone is starting, if someone's like, hey, dude, this sounds awesome,

1403
02:27:20.38 --> 02:27:24.94
I want to get into this. I want to get an archery. I want to get a bow. I want to, you know,

1404
02:27:24.94 --> 02:27:30.06
what, I want to go hunting. I want to be freaking stalking around in the forest with Kami Paint on my face.

1405
02:27:30.06 --> 02:27:35.58
Like, I'm in. I want to get into it. What, what do you recommend? How do you, how do you go about that?

1406
02:27:36.54 --> 02:27:41.98
Well, I think first, you should just, you know, Google, you know, Google archery shops and look at

1407
02:27:41.98 --> 02:27:48.54
ratings. There's, you know, some areas are very fortunate to have in an awesome archery shop that,

1408
02:27:48.54 --> 02:27:56.30
you know, has amazing, you know, entry level, you know, classes and programs like that.

1409
02:27:58.46 --> 02:28:05.98
But also, like, especially from our point of view, knock on archery.com is, you know, we offer free,

1410
02:28:06.86 --> 02:28:14.38
lessons and content. I just put out a series, you know, archery 101 with, you know, Mark Shanker from

1411
02:28:14.38 --> 02:28:19.42
Kickspan because you and I are both were like freaking hairstylingers from the 80s.

1412
02:28:19.98 --> 02:28:24.94
You're thinking of late babbin. Late babbin was a hairstylinger. Was not me. I wasn't listening to freaking

1413
02:28:24.94 --> 02:28:36.46
poison like you were. I'll give that to you, bro. Hold with you, God. You know, you do.

1414
02:28:37.02 --> 02:28:42.46
You know, offense against kicks, but they weren't in my freaking tape deck.

1415
02:28:42.46 --> 02:28:50.54
What was your top three for a black Sabbath motorhead, Led Zeppelin, ACDC, and then just

1416
02:28:50.54 --> 02:28:56.06
straight into all the hardcore stuff that I grew up on, Chrome Mags, Bad Brains,

1417
02:28:56.06 --> 02:28:58.78
Ignostic Front, right on down the line, who wants something?

1418
02:29:01.34 --> 02:29:08.06
Well, if you wanted that easier listening, you had alternatives. But, uh, no, we did, I just thought

1419
02:29:08.06 --> 02:29:15.18
it was a really cool story because, you know, he's, he's later in life, decided to pick up

1420
02:29:15.18 --> 02:29:21.82
jujitsu, you know, went down that path, you know, wanted to honestly wanted to like get away from

1421
02:29:21.82 --> 02:29:27.66
factory farming. And so, decided to go down the archery path and, you know, wanted to like get

1422
02:29:27.66 --> 02:29:33.42
good enough to where he could, you know, get his own food. So to speak, so it was really cool.

1423
02:29:33.42 --> 02:29:37.74
And we documented that and that's, you know, it was like a three-part series, which takes someone

1424
02:29:37.74 --> 02:29:44.38
from who had never pulled the bow back and just walked him through, like, you know,

1425
02:29:45.66 --> 02:29:52.54
same thing I did with Helen, right? You know, and saying, I didn't know anything about our tree.

1426
02:29:52.54 --> 02:29:58.46
You, again, man, so thankful that you decided, like, hey, you, you are going to really like this.

1427
02:29:58.46 --> 02:30:02.86
Because you heard me on Rogan and you're like, this guy needs to get a freaking bow. So you said it

1428
02:30:02.86 --> 02:30:08.86
up, you came out here, freaking, like, what did they say? Like, it's not going to come you on a silver

1429
02:30:08.86 --> 02:30:13.42
platter, right? In life, things are going to come to you on a silver platter. I literally got

1430
02:30:13.42 --> 02:30:17.82
archery on a silver platter. And I know it to everyone out there that's like this sample,

1431
02:30:17.82 --> 02:30:23.02
bitch, just had freaking doubly build mabo and then teach them. Like, that's what happened. I know,

1432
02:30:23.02 --> 02:30:28.86
I'm sorry that I got that freaking lucky. You know, my buddy Jack Manels at S. L. I'm front,

1433
02:30:28.86 --> 02:30:33.90
you know, Jack. But he, he's like, man, he's like, he's like, man,

1434
02:30:33.90 --> 02:30:41.02
done the touch of how to shoot, man. He's like so freaking pumped. So I know that I know that I got that,

1435
02:30:41.02 --> 02:30:47.26
but one, but I, I didn't even watch in your videos like before you came out to teach me. And so then

1436
02:30:47.26 --> 02:30:50.46
immediately, I go home and I'm like, all right, what are these videos that he's talking about? And I'm like,

1437
02:30:50.46 --> 02:30:54.86
oh, that's literally just what he told me to do. And he was like, I went through and I'm like,

1438
02:30:54.86 --> 02:31:00.78
oh, this is what you, so anybody that's thinking, I got so lucky. I did. I'm not taking that away.

1439
02:31:00.78 --> 02:31:05.26
But you can get just as lucky by going to press and freaking play on a YouTube video. And you're

1440
02:31:05.26 --> 02:31:09.98
going to get, you said the exact same things to me. You're like, hey, this is what you need to do. Here's

1441
02:31:09.98 --> 02:31:13.50
we start. Here's what this is. Here's what this is. And I'm like, okay, cool. And I'm doing it.

1442
02:31:13.50 --> 02:31:15.82
Then I go home and watch the videos. I'm like, that's what he just told me. He could have just sent

1443
02:31:15.82 --> 02:31:21.82
me the YouTube link. You have to fly out here to say, yeah, you go. So every, the, the fact that

1444
02:31:21.82 --> 02:31:28.46
you've given access to your actual program of coaching and it's available to anybody.

1445
02:31:28.46 --> 02:31:33.82
Yeah, it's available to anybody. So, and on our YouTube channel, you and I pair a lot

1446
02:31:33.82 --> 02:31:40.30
each other in that format. Like, and I heard you talk about it in the past. You've talked about,

1447
02:31:41.34 --> 02:31:45.90
you know, like, you know, for extreme ownership, right, when you first started doing it, and you

1448
02:31:45.90 --> 02:31:51.98
would, you know, probably when you started, you would get cash by going in places and doing that

1449
02:31:51.98 --> 02:31:58.62
presentation, which is kind of like when I used to travel Europe. And like my slide shows, you know,

1450
02:31:58.62 --> 02:32:04.14
if people took pictures of them, it kind of weirded me out. Like, I need to be booking, you know,

1451
02:32:04.14 --> 02:32:08.86
I need to book another spot. That's how I'm paying for my bills, you know. But then it gets to the

1452
02:32:08.86 --> 02:32:15.98
point where you realize, no, actually the more people you're helping, the more people that want to

1453
02:32:15.98 --> 02:32:24.78
dive deeper. So, you know, there came a point for me where I kind of knew I was going down the right

1454
02:32:24.78 --> 02:32:31.42
road when people that were on higher levels were getting mad at me because they're like, don't show

1455
02:32:31.42 --> 02:32:37.10
them how to do that. You know, why are you showing them how to do that, dude? You know, and because

1456
02:32:37.10 --> 02:32:44.22
the US was so dominant in archery competition for a long time in the compound both category,

1457
02:32:44.86 --> 02:32:51.26
and so like learning that ranging system on the unknown things, like, you know, that was never

1458
02:32:51.26 --> 02:32:56.86
telling you one, that sort of thing. But just all these small little things, you know, we'd go to

1459
02:32:56.86 --> 02:33:01.50
another country and see them like punching triggers or something, you know, my buddy, look at me,

1460
02:33:01.50 --> 02:33:04.94
like, you freaking talk to them about punching that trigger. I'm gonna punch you in the face.

1461
02:33:04.94 --> 02:33:15.58
You know, let's freaking do these people. So, but yeah, I just felt like the more I gave away,

1462
02:33:15.58 --> 02:33:21.26
it's also a really good filter because you really start to see how many people are absorbing what

1463
02:33:21.26 --> 02:33:26.94
you're saying, and not, you know, not being an asshole, where they're just asking and they never

1464
02:33:26.94 --> 02:33:32.46
apply, ask, never apply, never apply. You see people where you look at them and you're like, oh,

1465
02:33:32.46 --> 02:33:37.02
hey, man, when did you start shooting that silver back? And they're like, yeah, I watched, you know,

1466
02:33:37.02 --> 02:33:41.34
video blah, blah, blah, and I've been working on it. I think I'm getting better and meanwhile,

1467
02:33:41.34 --> 02:33:48.30
I know this because I'm seeing, you know, what I tried to teach being applied by someone that I know,

1468
02:33:48.30 --> 02:33:54.94
I didn't directly tell it to. So then naturally, it's like, well, hey, let me give you a little bit,

1469
02:33:54.94 --> 02:34:01.90
you know, let me help you progress, progress this a little bit. And I feel like, um, for you and I

1470
02:34:01.90 --> 02:34:09.18
both, you know, we just got to the point where we realized, lay it all out there. And yeah,

1471
02:34:09.18 --> 02:34:15.98
there's, there's certain places that we'll say, Dudley will give you anything to come out here and

1472
02:34:15.98 --> 02:34:22.86
like do it in person and blah, blah, blah. And yeah, I've got people, you know, we've auctioned a

1473
02:34:22.86 --> 02:34:27.58
couple of bows that have gone, you know, for a lot, for good, always for a good cause,

1474
02:34:27.58 --> 02:34:35.66
but we auctioned a bow that went for a lot for the Navy Seal Foundation to get to that million

1475
02:34:35.66 --> 02:34:42.06
dollar, March to a million mark. And, you know, even though it was a raffle, you know, people still

1476
02:34:42.06 --> 02:34:47.42
well, you know, not everyone's got 20 bucks to buy a bunch of raffle tickets and it's like,

1477
02:34:48.62 --> 02:34:54.94
you know, you can't make everyone happy, but the reality is, you know, if someone really wants to go through

1478
02:34:54.94 --> 02:35:03.18
and put it all together, they can, you know, they can read all these and, you know, so many different

1479
02:35:03.18 --> 02:35:11.90
things that I've heard you talk to people, you know, and give them, I don't know, you people will

1480
02:35:11.90 --> 02:35:16.94
come and be like, hey, you know, Jock, go give me some advice about this. And then, you know, go through

1481
02:35:16.94 --> 02:35:21.42
and look in here and I'm like, oh, yeah, well, you know, I've heard them apply that exact thing

1482
02:35:21.42 --> 02:35:25.98
and they acted like, you know, he just told them something this never been said and it's like, actually,

1483
02:35:26.46 --> 02:35:33.10
if they would follow that, like, you know, I'm a broken record when it comes to archery, I've,

1484
02:35:33.10 --> 02:35:41.02
I've boiled down a recipe to, you know, what I feel is like a balsamic glaze. It's like,

1485
02:35:41.02 --> 02:35:50.38
they're good stuff, you know, and I know like what can make most archers who are brand new be at a very

1486
02:35:50.38 --> 02:35:58.86
high level fast and eliminate a lot of mistakes, but, you know, whether you watch every video I have

1487
02:35:58.86 --> 02:36:04.78
or read all those articles or you come in person. Now, granted it's easier for me to see in person

1488
02:36:04.78 --> 02:36:11.34
if I'm breakdown, which that is the benefit to be an in person. You can directly connect, like,

1489
02:36:11.34 --> 02:36:16.54
right away, you're not having to figure out what am I doing wrong and research it, but other in that,

1490
02:36:16.54 --> 02:36:23.10
like, we put it all out there. If I learned something new or if we come out with a new product,

1491
02:36:23.10 --> 02:36:28.78
then, you know, we're, we're going to put it out there. And most of everything we do is always,

1492
02:36:28.78 --> 02:36:40.94
it's always a derivative of a need that I see that we can help with. And I remember specifically,

1493
02:36:40.94 --> 02:36:46.54
like, on that bow that we were talking about, I have chalkboards all around me, like,

1494
02:36:46.54 --> 02:36:53.74
you've been to my house and stuff. Most anywhere where I, if I sit down and I'm in there very long,

1495
02:36:53.74 --> 02:36:58.62
there's chalk, you know, most of my walls are just painted with chalkboard paint,

1496
02:36:58.62 --> 02:37:05.74
because I just write stuff down so don't forget it. But I remember, like, meeting this person

1497
02:37:05.74 --> 02:37:10.54
that kind of said, like, hey, I'd loved to embark on an archery journey where do I start?

1498
02:37:10.54 --> 02:37:16.30
And so I remember writing that down, which is the name of that bow is embark, because I'm, like,

1499
02:37:16.30 --> 02:37:20.54
you know, embark on your first archery journey, embark on your first bow hunt, you know.

1500
02:37:20.54 --> 02:37:28.70
So a lot of the things that we put out there are because there was a need, you know, my subject matter

1501
02:37:29.42 --> 02:37:34.70
comes from someone's problem that I need to help them fix. And I've been the subject of that a

1502
02:37:34.70 --> 02:37:39.34
few times on social media, like, hey, it's starting looking at Jocco's shot, he's doing this.

1503
02:37:39.34 --> 02:37:43.74
And I'm like, there you go. And it's awesome, you know, and that's the way it should be. You know,

1504
02:37:43.74 --> 02:37:49.66
it's funny is, what's not funny, but probably like the third podcast that we were doing,

1505
02:37:49.66 --> 02:37:55.02
maybe the fourth, something, but very early on in the podcast. I remember I had been asked a question

1506
02:37:55.02 --> 02:37:59.58
about leadership, and I was going to give the answer. And I was like, this answer that I'm about to

1507
02:37:59.58 --> 02:38:08.30
give is like very, very, very valuable. And it didn't, it wasn't like I had a major debate in my mind,

1508
02:38:08.30 --> 02:38:12.30
but it was more just an acceptance. It wasn't like I said, maybe I shouldn't give it away.

1509
02:38:12.30 --> 02:38:18.22
But it was more like I said, when I give this, this is given away something very, very valuable.

1510
02:38:18.22 --> 02:38:22.62
And that's what I'm going to do. Like maybe there's a little bit like, well, you know, because I

1511
02:38:22.62 --> 02:38:28.62
look, I have a leadership consulting company. Yeah. Right. That's what I do is I do leadership consulting.

1512
02:38:28.62 --> 02:38:32.46
If I'm just, you know, hey, go ahead. I'm just going to give away all the answers for free.

1513
02:38:33.10 --> 02:38:38.06
Well, maybe that's not a good idea. And if I had that thought, it was like I split second.

1514
02:38:38.06 --> 02:38:43.26
And I realized it was like, no, actually every possible thing that I can give to people to help them,

1515
02:38:43.26 --> 02:38:47.10
that's what we're doing. That's what I'm doing. And, and that's what you do. And like you said,

1516
02:38:47.10 --> 02:38:52.86
what it helps is that solves, look, no one in life is going to get to the end of their problems.

1517
02:38:52.86 --> 02:38:55.74
Right. No one's going to get to a point where they just like, oh, I don't have any problems

1518
02:38:55.74 --> 02:39:00.14
anymore with leadership. Right. Oh, I've got everything figured out. No one. And so there's, to

1519
02:39:00.14 --> 02:39:05.58
you solve a bunch of their problems, cool. Think, that's what. Now when you work with them,

1520
02:39:05.58 --> 02:39:09.58
you can do a problem. That's actually a little bit more complex. It's actually a little bit more

1521
02:39:09.58 --> 02:39:18.54
challenging. You know, like, I get kind of like you get asked, hey, Doug, you know, sometimes I hit

1522
02:39:18.54 --> 02:39:22.86
a little bit low to the left. And they're thinking that that's the first time you've ever been asked that.

1523
02:39:22.86 --> 02:39:29.02
You know what I mean? Or they say, hey, you know, once I'm sitting on a target, I start to, my hands

1524
02:39:29.02 --> 02:39:32.70
start to shake a little bit. Like they're thinking that this is only happening to them. You've been asked

1525
02:39:32.70 --> 02:39:37.82
that question 15 million talkness, right? And happens to me too, like, you know, hey, Jocquat,

1526
02:39:37.82 --> 02:39:41.10
I know you talk about cover move, but sometimes people are working with, they don't really,

1527
02:39:41.10 --> 02:39:45.18
you know, they don't want to do their part. So how does that even work? I've been, they think that

1528
02:39:45.18 --> 02:39:49.90
that's the only time that's ever happened. And it's actually happened 15 million times that I've been

1529
02:39:49.90 --> 02:39:56.06
asked that question. So give it away. Give away as much as you can to people and that

1530
02:39:56.06 --> 02:40:01.18
elevates everybody. And that means they're, they're seeing value in what you're doing and they're appreciative.

1531
02:40:01.18 --> 02:40:06.38
And now, guess what? They get their problems. That problem solved. Cool. If they never have a problem,

1532
02:40:06.38 --> 02:40:11.02
again, that's great. Cool. That's great. Good for them. That's awesome. I'm happy.

1533
02:40:11.02 --> 02:40:14.62
Someone else is going to have that problem. I'm going to learn, by the way, it's just, it's just

1534
02:40:14.62 --> 02:40:17.98
if it's doing the right things the right reasons. Like I said, if you're doing the right things,

1535
02:40:17.98 --> 02:40:22.94
the right reasons is going to pay off in the end. You and I are really similar in a lot of ways, like,

1536
02:40:22.94 --> 02:40:30.78
you know, right now, sharing an I are staying, you know, in your old house. So just lurking around and

1537
02:40:30.78 --> 02:40:40.38
seeing some of your stuff. I mean, you're, you're not like a gadgety person. You're like, even

1538
02:40:40.38 --> 02:40:46.46
your weights, you know, the first one you got at eBay or where you know, before eBay, when you

1539
02:40:46.46 --> 02:40:52.94
walked in the freaking second win fitness or whatever, freaking bought this rustile for a thing you got.

1540
02:40:52.94 --> 02:41:03.66
But you, I don't freaking old. What you do. Everything you do is that way, but I'm glad you knew

1541
02:41:03.66 --> 02:41:11.82
that the bands you used to work out were not mine. They were my wife's and daughters. But I think

1542
02:41:13.02 --> 02:41:22.06
your consistency with like, you get good at the tools you have and you build yourself around

1543
02:41:22.06 --> 02:41:28.22
those tools. You don't get tools to try to continue to make you better. You know, you're not like

1544
02:41:28.22 --> 02:41:32.78
looking for the cheat code looking for the cheat code. Yeah. I know you talk about that for a hack.

1545
02:41:32.78 --> 02:41:36.14
Like, well, this, if I get this, it'll make me a little bit, it'll make a little bit easier.

1546
02:41:36.14 --> 02:41:39.42
Now, I'm glad we're not talking about surfboards because you also saw my mama surfboards on

1547
02:41:39.42 --> 02:41:47.50
which is kind of rigging ridiculous. Yeah. Yeah, surfboards is like a freaking junkyard of surfboards all

1548
02:41:47.50 --> 02:41:52.06
over the place. Yeah. And there's a little bit of an excuse for that because different waves

1549
02:41:52.06 --> 02:41:57.34
require different boards. Yeah. There's a lot of different waves to surf. I mean, my artier

1550
02:41:57.34 --> 02:42:03.74
room looks very similar to that. But I don't change unless there's a change needed for the application.

1551
02:42:03.74 --> 02:42:10.22
Now, one of the things with me is I never really had great continual coaching. A lot of the

1552
02:42:10.22 --> 02:42:17.18
things that I teach are from mistakes like no one ever told me why I missed low left. I had to figure

1553
02:42:17.18 --> 02:42:24.78
that out over a lot of frustration. And so like once I've learned those things, everything I

1554
02:42:24.78 --> 02:42:29.74
boiled down is to try to help eliminate those mistakes and learning curves. You know,

1555
02:42:30.38 --> 02:42:37.90
shouldn't say it's cheat codes, but just like me, freaking surfing yesterday, I do try to take a

1556
02:42:37.90 --> 02:42:47.58
direct line of tech. So my coaching method is very direct line of attack to where you're

1557
02:42:47.58 --> 02:42:55.10
eliminating mistakes, but like getting to that particular point of topic as efficient as possible

1558
02:42:55.10 --> 02:43:04.06
to where you're not expanding valuable energy in that artri shot. I just want to make sure we capture

1559
02:43:04.06 --> 02:43:10.70
a couple things here. So I'm never done artri before and I want to get into artri. What's we

1560
02:43:10.70 --> 02:43:16.54
we look for a good artri shop, we read the reviews, what's a good amount of money to spend on that

1561
02:43:16.54 --> 02:43:22.30
first investment is it better to go and like, hey, should you go and try like, hey, can I try a bow?

1562
02:43:22.30 --> 02:43:26.94
Like, let me shoot some suit. It feels like in the shop, just to just to make sure you're like,

1563
02:43:26.94 --> 02:43:33.50
oh, yeah, this is freaking cool. Or is it like, you know, spend a thousand bucks, spend 800 bucks,

1564
02:43:33.50 --> 02:43:38.86
what's going to get you in the game? Well, I think if you go there and you try it, most artri

1565
02:43:38.86 --> 02:43:44.86
shops are going to let you try it a little bit. I think that would be valuable and be really

1566
02:43:44.86 --> 02:43:50.86
specific to them to where you're new. You want to make sure you buy a equipment that's very

1567
02:43:50.86 --> 02:43:57.90
suited for you as a beginner. And one of the examples of that is when you buy a bow, they have like,

1568
02:43:57.90 --> 02:44:01.90
you know, they all have pulling weight. So when you pull them back, you know, it takes a certain

1569
02:44:01.90 --> 02:44:07.90
amount of strength to pull them back. I'm real strong. Yeah. I want 500 pounds. Yeah, that's

1570
02:44:07.90 --> 02:44:15.98
Jocco walking in. But a beginner like our wives, for example, if they went into a lot of shops,

1571
02:44:15.98 --> 02:44:21.02
some shops, especially if they were excited and just wanted to buy it right then, they would

1572
02:44:21.02 --> 02:44:27.98
make do with equipment that they have and like size it down for them versus I would weigh rather

1573
02:44:27.98 --> 02:44:34.62
say, hey, I'll wait a couple weeks to order something to work. You know, it's my pull away the bow

1574
02:44:34.62 --> 02:44:39.74
is the right size for me because they can always make it work. But you know, getting the right

1575
02:44:39.74 --> 02:44:46.14
equipment off the get go and being upfront with them of, hey, I really want to do this. I enjoy it.

1576
02:44:46.14 --> 02:44:53.98
I want the right equipment. And it's my personal belief that if you get in on like the lower and

1577
02:44:53.98 --> 02:45:01.58
stuff, you're going to, you can progress really fast with our tree. So what'll happen is you're going

1578
02:45:01.58 --> 02:45:07.42
to do it just a short period of time and realize I'm actually better than this beginner piece of

1579
02:45:07.42 --> 02:45:14.46
equipment and then you realize the value of beginner equipment is kind of a poor investment because

1580
02:45:15.02 --> 02:45:22.30
it's just you're going to sell it for way less because everybody got that cheap entry point.

1581
02:45:22.30 --> 02:45:30.22
So like with the bow that we did the embark, that bow allows you to get a bow at a price

1582
02:45:30.22 --> 02:45:35.10
to where you can put some really high indexes or he's on it because the accessories can carry over.

1583
02:45:35.10 --> 02:45:43.42
It'd be like, you know, if you went and got a, you know, a cool freaking AR but then like

1584
02:45:43.98 --> 02:45:48.78
you, you know, shot your wallet on buying that thing. So then you went, you know, you went and bought

1585
02:45:48.78 --> 02:45:54.22
an abeski and then you're like, well, I got 50 bucks left and you got to borrow your buddies like

1586
02:45:54.22 --> 02:46:01.50
red rider, bevy got like scope that came on it to like put on your abeski. That's going to be a

1587
02:46:01.50 --> 02:46:08.86
problem. So I tell people, you know, get high indexesaries, get, you know, quality arrows, high indexesaries,

1588
02:46:08.86 --> 02:46:14.54
get a bow that's in the middle of the road to where if you move up in that bow, you can transfer

1589
02:46:14.54 --> 02:46:19.58
your accessories over which, you know, we've done with you, you know, we can transfer the accessory.

1590
02:46:19.58 --> 02:46:24.30
I went high end on your accessories because you don't want accessory, like you don't want your

1591
02:46:24.30 --> 02:46:29.18
site moving, you know, if your, if your site's moving around or if your arrow rest is moving around,

1592
02:46:29.18 --> 02:46:33.26
then there's none of us that are going to know how well you're really shooting because

1593
02:46:33.26 --> 02:46:41.42
there's just continual variables. But I think I think for a thousand bucks, you can get in to

1594
02:46:41.42 --> 02:46:48.22
where you can get in and stand without having to re-up and re-up and re-up. But you want something

1595
02:46:48.22 --> 02:46:53.82
that has the ability to, especially if you're still growing, you want to have a cam system

1596
02:46:54.54 --> 02:46:58.70
that and that's kind of the pulley looking things on the bow, you want to be able to have

1597
02:46:58.70 --> 02:47:05.26
something that's adjustable. And especially when you're learning like as a coach, I'm not going

1598
02:47:05.26 --> 02:47:14.14
to be hypersensitive of you being exactly your drawing, which is like your posture when you're

1599
02:47:14.78 --> 02:47:19.18
at like a full drop position with your bow pulling it back because you can pull a bow back to

1600
02:47:19.18 --> 02:47:25.74
different lengths. There's a good chance that your technique is going to slightly change over the

1601
02:47:25.74 --> 02:47:30.54
course of getting better to where you might need to make some adjustments with that. So having

1602
02:47:30.54 --> 02:47:37.18
something that has the ability to adjust is also awesome, what you get when you spend. It's kind

1603
02:47:37.18 --> 02:47:42.94
of like, I think there's like $100 increments like you can get a bow for 400 bucks, but you're

1604
02:47:42.94 --> 02:47:49.74
going to be limited, you know, and then I think once you get to like $699, $799 for the bow

1605
02:47:49.74 --> 02:47:56.38
only, you're in a really good position and then put good accessories on it and you'll be enjoying it

1606
02:47:56.38 --> 02:48:05.02
for that level bow, like the embark, like you go on haunt with that thing. This is, yeah, I'll

1607
02:48:05.02 --> 02:48:11.58
shoot one day at the tax, we'll be with an embark and then one day I'll be with an Indian. Like

1608
02:48:12.94 --> 02:48:20.30
in last year, I took that bow, you know, on one of my most memorable hunts, you know, because I've

1609
02:48:20.30 --> 02:48:26.38
always, that's one thing I've always done is I want people to feel like even though for a

1610
02:48:26.38 --> 02:48:32.94
particular brand, they have a low-end model, a mid-grade model and a high-end model. I've always

1611
02:48:32.94 --> 02:48:38.78
put some of those budget bows to a test and I've used them because I want, I don't want people to

1612
02:48:38.78 --> 02:48:44.54
feel like they can only shoot archery if they have the best gear. I've proven time and time and

1613
02:48:44.54 --> 02:48:53.58
time again that that middle range is a very good place to get in and you can honestly, you can stay there

1614
02:48:54.30 --> 02:49:01.10
and be totally okay but, you know, it's no different than, you know, there's a lot of cars that are

1615
02:49:01.10 --> 02:49:10.94
awesome but, you know, I like my ram but I might want that hellcat ram. Even though technically

1616
02:49:10.94 --> 02:49:18.38
drives the same. Right on, well I think that's that's good info and I'm sure a bunch of people

1617
02:49:18.38 --> 02:49:23.34
to probably good, yeah, we're approaching three hours right now but I just wanted to make sure

1618
02:49:23.34 --> 02:49:27.66
people are going to get interested in this. I want people and by the way, you have all this

1619
02:49:27.66 --> 02:49:32.14
information on your YouTube channel about like, wow, to get started, what to look for,

1620
02:49:32.78 --> 02:49:39.02
everything from freaking arrows to the book, like everything. So it's, it's all out there if you want to go

1621
02:49:39.02 --> 02:49:47.26
a little bit deeper but, yeah, man, obviously I appreciate you coming on but, man, I appreciate,

1622
02:49:47.26 --> 02:49:52.94
I appreciate what you're doing, what you're doing for veterans, you know, that are out there,

1623
02:49:52.94 --> 02:49:55.82
what you're doing for your whole community, people that are making their life better because

1624
02:49:55.82 --> 02:50:02.30
they're out there, they got a mission and absolutely what you've done for me helped me out delivering

1625
02:50:02.30 --> 02:50:06.78
silver platter, bow hunting to me, which again, I'm sorry for everyone for being so spoiled.

1626
02:50:06.78 --> 02:50:13.66
I'm lucky and I appreciate it but, man, it's been awesome and I want to help get other people

1627
02:50:13.66 --> 02:50:17.90
heading down that path because I mean, I think it's beneficial in so many different ways, man.

1628
02:50:17.90 --> 02:50:24.30
Yeah, it is 100% I think it's an awesome and awesome sport, especially for people that come from

1629
02:50:24.30 --> 02:50:30.38
your background who are looking for a new mission, you know, you set it perfectly because

1630
02:50:30.38 --> 02:50:38.62
with all of you guys who have done it, you know, learning a new discipline or a new trade

1631
02:50:39.50 --> 02:50:46.14
is one thing but then once it comes to like packing up to freaking go on call,

1632
02:50:47.02 --> 02:50:53.82
that lights a whole different intensity where, you know, hey, we're meeting, you know,

1633
02:50:53.82 --> 02:51:02.38
we're out at dark, back at dark and when you're out there, you know, geared up and freaking

1634
02:51:02.38 --> 02:51:08.06
ready to get after it, you know, I remember the first time you and I went out and we were on that

1635
02:51:08.06 --> 02:51:16.54
hillside, glass and you just said, bro, this freaking, this is a recon right now, like, you know,

1636
02:51:16.54 --> 02:51:21.50
I'd have a team right over there, there'd be freaking two dudes right there, they'd be like,

1637
02:51:21.50 --> 02:51:26.38
you know, back up and then we'd be here and like, you know, the shit would be all pulled over

1638
02:51:26.38 --> 02:51:34.62
tight, you know, you were in your element just dorking out. Yeah, well, you were head freaking

1639
02:51:34.62 --> 02:51:41.98
dork on the center, also, it's awesome man. Echo, Charles, you can see what kind of

1640
02:51:41.98 --> 02:51:52.54
focus and consistency it takes to approach excellence in any element cognitive focus. But the

1641
02:51:52.54 --> 02:51:57.74
pursuit never stops, the pursuit of excellence does stop, what suggestions do you have?

1642
02:51:58.78 --> 02:52:03.98
Oh, well, I was moving in there, right, you know, we talked about being an athlete,

1643
02:52:04.54 --> 02:52:09.82
right, the importance, the value of being an athlete, which I was with you the whole time, I

1644
02:52:09.82 --> 02:52:13.74
agree fully, but we don't want to stop that just because we get older and take on other

1645
02:52:13.74 --> 02:52:18.46
responsibilities. Are you getting older? Well, that's got a sock. It's just one of those things

1646
02:52:18.46 --> 02:52:25.02
man. The life I live nonetheless, we got to stay in the game even on our off time. There's no

1647
02:52:25.02 --> 02:52:30.86
off time on time. There's just time. Something like that, unless we have things to help you through

1648
02:52:30.86 --> 02:52:34.54
this journey supplementation. First thing, you talk about focus, we have discipline.

1649
02:52:34.54 --> 02:52:39.98
I was able to look at you just to get you on track, because you were starting to stray.

1650
02:52:39.98 --> 02:52:44.62
Whatever you go, those are talking about all this. I can probably chime in on a few things,

1651
02:52:44.62 --> 02:52:52.22
because I can tell you like three things that are pinnacles for me from, you know, from origin,

1652
02:52:52.86 --> 02:52:59.74
cold war, freaking joint warfare, and the vitamin D, and freaking have powered through

1653
02:52:59.74 --> 02:53:09.98
COVID, you know, COVID year was like no factor. No factor, but those three for me are every day.

1654
02:53:09.98 --> 02:53:14.14
They're like right next to my cup of coffee, where I know I'm getting after it first thing in the

1655
02:53:14.14 --> 02:53:19.10
morning. Yeah, that those are freaking legit. The joint warfare is,

1656
02:53:20.94 --> 02:53:25.66
the Go-Reeder Reviews on Dr. Warford, don't listen to me. Who am I? I'm free. I own the company.

1657
02:53:25.66 --> 02:53:29.34
Of course I would take you good, right? Go read the reviews from other people,

1658
02:53:29.34 --> 02:53:33.10
and what it does to them, and what they say that grandma started taking it. Now,

1659
02:53:33.10 --> 02:53:37.02
of the sudden, you know, she's whatever playing tennis again, and whatnot.

1660
02:53:38.30 --> 02:53:43.18
Yeah, true. But this is the whole purpose, yeah, you own the company.

1661
02:53:43.18 --> 02:53:49.02
Oh, but the whole purpose that you have this stuff is because that was like your pursuit even before

1662
02:53:49.02 --> 02:53:53.82
that. True. Like, yeah, you got to take this stuff, real oil, you know, all the ingredients, you know,

1663
02:53:53.82 --> 02:53:57.58
and then, well, you added some ingredients to the joint warfare. That's not too big, that's bad.

1664
02:53:57.58 --> 02:54:01.10
Because why not, like, it's not like, all I'm just going to take, no, make it better.

1665
02:54:01.10 --> 02:54:06.78
Make it the best possible thing that you can put into your mouth to make your freaking

1666
02:54:06.78 --> 02:54:13.50
joints bulletproof, son. Yeah, true. And I'm with you with that combo every day. The

1667
02:54:13.50 --> 02:54:18.62
cold or not is much that that's kind of a seasonal thing. Don't like the cold super

1668
02:54:18.62 --> 02:54:23.58
curl too. Get that curl oil on, man. Get them little fish down. What if they fish? No,

1669
02:54:23.58 --> 02:54:29.34
little shrimp. Little shrimps. Little tiny shrimps. Fish well. Good to the. Yeah,

1670
02:54:29.34 --> 02:54:31.98
maybe want to look good. Fish oil is good. Yeah, you're right.

1671
02:54:31.98 --> 02:54:37.66
Chuck, there's some label here. I will say something. If it's in there, he's read it and

1672
02:54:37.66 --> 02:54:42.54
researched it. There's a reason that we see fish oil is like whatever. That's your freaking

1673
02:54:42.54 --> 02:54:48.14
$400 bill. Yeah. Kriola is the entry or the Kriola is the freaking top of the line.

1674
02:54:48.14 --> 02:54:54.62
It's the top of the line. Super curl is where it's at. I understand fully.

1675
02:54:54.62 --> 02:55:00.22
I mentioned the discipline this one go. Hey, look. Some of us are into energy drinks,

1676
02:55:00.22 --> 02:55:04.62
but really we're not into energy drinks. We're into the idea of energy drinks. And what they don't

1677
02:55:04.62 --> 02:55:10.14
tell you about the whole energy drink thing is that there's poison inside. Straight up normal energy

1678
02:55:10.14 --> 02:55:15.82
drinks. Yeah. Tradish. Tradish. That's why. Yeah. So this is the upgrade. This is the, I don't know

1679
02:55:15.82 --> 02:55:19.18
whatever you guys call it. I think you know, I don't even think it's an upgrade. I think it's new category.

1680
02:55:19.18 --> 02:55:23.02
Yeah. It's new category. It's like, oh, we're over here drinking poison. You're over here drinking

1681
02:55:23.02 --> 02:55:29.98
something that's awesome for you. Clean alternatives is like a long overdue category for

1682
02:55:30.70 --> 02:55:37.90
because think of how many guys went in and got after it in victory and then walked out and just

1683
02:55:37.90 --> 02:55:44.78
grabbed dog crap in a plastic bottle to like have something on the way out the door. Yeah.

1684
02:55:44.78 --> 02:55:52.06
It is way past you. Yeah. Way past you. Yeah. It's almost like, and I'm not as in touch with it,

1685
02:55:52.06 --> 02:55:57.42
but I'm a casual, we'll say, but it seems like the whole energy casual. What? It's, I mean,

1686
02:55:57.42 --> 02:56:02.06
besides life. Everything. What all of the above. You said you're a casual. What are you talking about?

1687
02:56:02.06 --> 02:56:07.10
You know, energy drinks before you see, if it wasn't for me being on deployment, like

1688
02:56:07.98 --> 02:56:14.06
with with energy drinks and needing them because I need this like, hey, I'm freaking wicked tired.

1689
02:56:14.06 --> 02:56:19.90
And I've been awake for 48 hours and I need caffeine into my system. That's why I started drinking

1690
02:56:19.90 --> 02:56:24.94
energy drinks. And then, but what do you deal with? You deal with, oh, I got done drinking the

1691
02:56:24.94 --> 02:56:30.78
energy drink. Now I don't have that way freaking out for anymore. And now I feel like dog shit.

1692
02:56:30.78 --> 02:56:34.62
Yeah. Yeah. And that's exactly what I'm trying to do. There's a bunch of junk in there.

1693
02:56:34.62 --> 02:56:38.14
This exactly what I'm saying. You're talking about like, what about you in the club?

1694
02:56:39.34 --> 02:56:42.06
What about you and you and freaking door man of the year or whatever?

1695
02:56:42.06 --> 02:56:49.42
I never, I never, I never, I never got into energy drinks as much. You know, every once in a while,

1696
02:56:49.42 --> 02:56:53.90
whatever, I just drink coffee because they have coffee available. Oh, whatever. It's for a

1697
02:56:53.90 --> 02:56:57.66
stain up. No, but I'm talking about like activity. You're talking about going on deployment.

1698
02:56:57.66 --> 02:57:02.38
All this time. I don't like the taste of coffee. Okay. Yeah. I understand. Sure. I was talking to Evan

1699
02:57:02.38 --> 02:57:07.50
and Evan's like, bro, I want to get bring up to Utah and I'm going to figure out what

1700
02:57:07.50 --> 02:57:12.94
coffee, you know, what coffee like there's, you know, there's got to be a way. You know, he's like a,

1701
02:57:12.94 --> 02:57:18.86
he's like a, a Somalia of the Java being. Right. And he's like, I want to create it.

1702
02:57:18.86 --> 02:57:23.66
The job. He's texting me. He's like, yeah, he's like, he's a commissar. Man, we're going to get you

1703
02:57:23.66 --> 02:57:27.74
the, you know, the the been that you like and the roast that you like and all the stuff.

1704
02:57:27.74 --> 02:57:33.58
I texted back, I go, bro, I don't even like coffee ice cream. Good luck. He's started laughing.

1705
02:57:33.58 --> 02:57:38.70
But that's kind of an important factor right there because coffee like coffee's like beer,

1706
02:57:38.70 --> 02:57:42.62
where it's like at the end of the day, you're always going to have the beer flavor. There's a beer

1707
02:57:42.62 --> 02:57:47.18
flavor. But there's a coffee flavor. And then from that flavor, they, it was a different

1708
02:57:47.18 --> 02:57:51.42
ride. Or what I wasn't able to taste in that coffee wouldn't be coffee. Exactly. If you made it with

1709
02:57:51.42 --> 02:57:55.82
freaking cocoa beans, it wouldn't be coffee. Yes. Right. If you made it with tea leaves, it wouldn't be

1710
02:57:55.82 --> 02:58:00.54
coffee. Correct. Yeah. Exactly. Or strawberry, so whatever Evan was trying to put on your

1711
02:58:00.54 --> 02:58:05.74
flavors. We'll see. I don't know. He's a freaking, he's into it, man. He maybe can pull it off.

1712
02:58:05.74 --> 02:58:10.62
We'll see. It's chocolate peanut butter. You might be a little bit. That's like you with

1713
02:58:10.62 --> 02:58:14.86
milk, bro. Like I sent you like a whatever. You got some milk and then like two weeks later

1714
02:58:14.86 --> 02:58:18.62
to look him or one. You're like a freaking cracker. He's probably the one that's

1715
02:58:18.62 --> 02:58:23.66
milk of the new man. That was that dude. All right. We'll give you three days and that freaking

1716
02:58:23.66 --> 02:58:28.78
ball. Yeah. It's true. But the energy drinks is like a lot of these activities that they're

1717
02:58:28.78 --> 02:58:34.30
sometimes in my observation, which is limited I know, but in my observation, it's associated with

1718
02:58:34.30 --> 02:58:40.14
these activities that are kind of, let's just say they would benefit more from a healthy,

1719
02:58:40.14 --> 02:58:44.38
oh for sure. For sure. For sure. Yeah. Why would you be doing something that's physically

1720
02:58:44.38 --> 02:58:49.26
demanding and putting poison in your body? So you okay, don't do it. You go to big sky,

1721
02:58:49.26 --> 02:58:53.74
whatever. You know that hill. You're always sending me videos of you guys charging and whatever. What's

1722
02:58:53.74 --> 02:59:00.38
it called? The big. I don't know what's a mountain. Yeah. Of course. What is that called?

1723
02:59:00.38 --> 02:59:05.82
This is called. Yeah. Yeah. Bro, when I ran up that thing after you and I were like,

1724
02:59:05.82 --> 02:59:09.02
kept walking down that mountain every day and be like, Panister be a good workout. Why when

1725
02:59:09.02 --> 02:59:13.90
when I went and did it, I was like, you're up confirmed. That sucks. Yeah. And that's what I'm saying.

1726
02:59:13.90 --> 02:59:18.62
So, so then you, we write the lift up there. Okay. So in the snow, we'll say,

1727
02:59:18.62 --> 02:59:25.82
if you really used to it, okay, good. But just being in the snow, just like just being in the ocean

1728
02:59:25.82 --> 02:59:33.74
or on deployment or in the woods, part of my lack of terminology, but it is just, it is woods.

1729
02:59:33.74 --> 02:59:37.82
Okay. Just being there, bro, it's like that's in and of itself is a thing.

1730
02:59:38.86 --> 02:59:42.38
Like you can't, you're not just cruising, you're just working. Right. So you're okay. And then

1731
02:59:42.38 --> 02:59:46.54
you're doing your activity on top of that and whether you're in big sky, you know, the woods,

1732
02:59:46.54 --> 02:59:51.50
water, whatever, like, you're gonna, you're not gonna want poison in that scenario right there.

1733
02:59:51.50 --> 02:59:55.26
No, or even anything that you're gonna pay the price later or something like that. And it's not needed.

1734
02:59:55.26 --> 02:59:59.34
You don't need to. You don't need that poison. And that's why guys did the good stuff.

1735
02:59:59.34 --> 03:00:03.74
And now, hey, wow, wow. If you want this stuff for you on the east coast, go to wow,

1736
03:00:03.74 --> 03:00:09.98
and, you know, they were saying, they tried to pull the reins on us. They're like, don't tell

1737
03:00:09.98 --> 03:00:15.10
everyone to clear the shelf. Stop, stop saying the back. We're back. See if you can run that

1738
03:00:15.10 --> 03:00:19.74
supply chain into the ground. I challenge you all to see if you can run that supply chain into the

1739
03:00:19.74 --> 03:00:23.98
ground for me. See what happens. If you do, well, figure something out. I'll do, what's something

1740
03:00:23.98 --> 03:00:29.98
I could do? Like make a funny hat put on a funny hat and do a video or something.

1741
03:00:29.98 --> 03:00:35.02
Grow those bangs back. Go on. I'm free to value that haircut back. That ain't happened.

1742
03:00:36.38 --> 03:00:41.74
To me, to me, to me, hair, it's bothersome to me when my hair is like a quarter of an inch

1743
03:00:41.74 --> 03:00:47.26
longer than ever. Like it already bothers me. So go on that distance. Would freaking drive me crazy.

1744
03:00:47.26 --> 03:00:53.74
Unacceptable. Yeah. But did you do every job? Yeah, vitamin shop. And there's a subscription

1745
03:00:53.74 --> 03:00:59.74
scenario. John, you don't want to run out of that that that every day supply, you know,

1746
03:00:59.74 --> 03:01:03.58
jockelfuel.com, which by the way is where you're going to go. I think they call the good good.

1747
03:01:04.14 --> 03:01:10.62
What's the good good? That's a subscription. Oh, yeah. Well, here's the old man. We're not,

1748
03:01:10.62 --> 03:01:15.34
look, we're not alone in the world. There's good good. There's capitalism out here. We're competing

1749
03:01:15.34 --> 03:01:20.22
on an open market. We're competing with some people that are pretty big. So when you compete with

1750
03:01:20.22 --> 03:01:23.10
people that are pretty big, you've got to figure how you're going to make something happen. So what

1751
03:01:23.10 --> 03:01:27.26
we want to do is free shipping, right? Because people are very used to free shipping.

1752
03:01:27.98 --> 03:01:33.42
Because there's some companies out there that do free shipping. And so how can we make that happen?

1753
03:01:33.42 --> 03:01:38.14
The way we made it happen is if you get subscriptions to any of these products, the boom,

1754
03:01:38.14 --> 03:01:43.98
shipping is free. There you go. All right, cool. Also, origin USA.com. Okay, this is where you can get

1755
03:01:43.98 --> 03:01:49.74
American made stuff from jujitsu stuff all the way down to non-jujitsu everyday stuff and like

1756
03:01:49.74 --> 03:01:55.50
for real, everyday stuff. Like jeans, like jeans, like all that. Boots, boots. Yeah, still wait.

1757
03:01:55.50 --> 03:02:02.46
Number hat, Pete, which hat, a bini, a ball cap? No, that you know the one that he wears. We both

1758
03:02:02.46 --> 03:02:06.78
were that one. What do they call the flat cap? Those are called a flat cap. But they're like,

1759
03:02:06.78 --> 03:02:12.30
kind of the French one. Yeah, it's called a flat cap. It's not like a fedura. No, it's called a flat

1760
03:02:12.30 --> 03:02:18.54
cap. It's like what you see like a little British dude wear. Do I Andy got me one in France, a

1761
03:02:18.54 --> 03:02:24.62
camo one that I wear sometimes. And it's made out of ammo flat cap. Hell yeah, dude. Oh, glad you.

1762
03:02:25.26 --> 03:02:31.58
And it's made out of like sweatshirt material. And it's freaking comfy on your head. I hunted with it.

1763
03:02:31.58 --> 03:02:38.46
I told Pete like, make me that out of my origin hoodie material. Because that hoodie's like the

1764
03:02:38.46 --> 03:02:43.66
my favorite thing I wear around the house every day. Oh, yeah, that thing's freaking. The freaking

1765
03:02:43.66 --> 03:02:49.74
midway, that soft ass one. It's freaking awesome. Right. You used to say it most comfortable

1766
03:02:49.74 --> 03:02:55.42
sweat suit every and makes. They make pants to match that. Yeah, that are like longer than

1767
03:02:55.42 --> 03:03:01.18
28 inches. Or yeah, you got to get a situation. But we'll sew two pairs to

1768
03:03:01.18 --> 03:03:07.90
better. You're freaking long as legs. I heard the hour I saw they had some socks.

1769
03:03:07.90 --> 03:03:11.50
Bruney. Yeah, socks are bruney. We're gonna make everything. Interesting. You make everything.

1770
03:03:11.50 --> 03:03:15.82
Everything. We're bringing it back to America. We're gonna make it so you can wear it. And

1771
03:03:15.82 --> 03:03:19.50
we will make it. Like they're making all these different like cool socks. But at some point,

1772
03:03:19.50 --> 03:03:24.62
I'm just gonna make straight up white socks like you know I roll. See, you have a lot of good

1773
03:03:24.62 --> 03:03:32.14
ideas. You do that one. When are you gonna make a jock strap? I don't know. You need to make a

1774
03:03:32.14 --> 03:03:40.62
jock strap. That's a good call, man. That's a great. That's a great one. I've been here in

1775
03:03:40.62 --> 03:03:48.78
that joke since I was in third grade. Well, for good reasons. But yeah, good. Yes, all American

1776
03:03:48.78 --> 03:03:52.46
made stuff. Really good. Also, Jocquas store is called Jocquas store. And this is where you

1777
03:03:52.46 --> 03:04:00.06
can get shirts and rash guards and hoodies and hats and stuff. That are represented of the path

1778
03:04:00.06 --> 03:04:05.90
directly. And then there's the shirt locker. Which is how this is what savages people want to.

1779
03:04:05.90 --> 03:04:10.78
Yeah, by the way. This is what, this is how savage people are. So we have this thing called the shirt locker.

1780
03:04:10.78 --> 03:04:15.82
Yeah. It's, it's a subscription. And if you're on the subscription, you get like a one-off

1781
03:04:15.82 --> 03:04:21.50
t-shirt. Like if you have to be on, you like, you can't go buy it later. So somebody's actually

1782
03:04:21.50 --> 03:04:27.02
think a couple people are already jacking the designs. I don't even know how to say that. It's not

1783
03:04:27.02 --> 03:04:32.54
like that design is like on this place. People, people posted it. People posted the real one.

1784
03:04:32.54 --> 03:04:36.30
So like, and then they, then they jack it and they put it on these websites. Like, hey,

1785
03:04:37.34 --> 03:04:43.10
it's freaking ridiculous. But it's how savage people are. It is savage and it is lame. But it's,

1786
03:04:43.10 --> 03:04:49.34
there's like a few, you told me that they only use the word savage in a negative way. But I

1787
03:04:49.34 --> 03:04:55.98
know, I guess we're using a positive way. Yeah. More off, I think you just, you just more tuned to it.

1788
03:04:55.98 --> 03:05:02.62
Because I say it with such disc like those just, that's just, what a savage. Yeah. When, when somebody's,

1789
03:05:02.62 --> 03:05:07.18
like, doesn't have the creativity to figure out how to make a cool t-shirt and sell it instead,

1790
03:05:07.58 --> 03:05:15.82
they're just savages and just stealing a design. Yeah. What, who does that? Yeah, it, it's savages.

1791
03:05:15.82 --> 03:05:23.34
Now what's jacked up is you could also be like, oh man, like, you can, obviously be super positive

1792
03:05:23.34 --> 03:05:28.30
thing. Like, oh, like you said earlier, you're like, hey, where the weed of twins are from,

1793
03:05:28.30 --> 03:05:31.82
where the weed of brothers are from, there's a bunch of savages in their neighborhood.

1794
03:05:31.82 --> 03:05:35.82
They're wrestlers in their fighters and I was like, yeah, cool. I totally knew what you were talking about.

1795
03:05:35.82 --> 03:05:39.50
Yeah. So it's one of those words that can go either way. But that's a compliment word.

1796
03:05:39.50 --> 03:05:47.90
We've had many conversations where if Jocco says savage, it's, it's a high compliment for someone

1797
03:05:47.90 --> 03:05:52.94
that doesn't know they just got one. It is a weird thing because I use it as the highest,

1798
03:05:52.94 --> 03:05:58.30
one of the highest, one of the lowest insults I can give. It's literally the same word.

1799
03:05:58.30 --> 03:06:07.58
That dudes a savage or that dudes a savage or a fucking bunch of savages. I don't know how they get the,

1800
03:06:07.58 --> 03:06:13.10
the design because it's not like, okay, like the one, okay, so hard-core recondos are good or

1801
03:06:13.10 --> 03:06:17.26
just when equals freedom. You go to like, I don't want to tell anyone how to, how to get it. But

1802
03:06:17.90 --> 03:06:22.70
it's on display somewhere, you know, but the shirt locker ones, they tend, they're not.

1803
03:06:22.70 --> 03:06:27.02
There's like a hint of them somewhere. No, but no, no, people are taking when they get their shirt

1804
03:06:27.02 --> 03:06:31.74
locker shirt and they're posting it. Oh, they're posting it. Like, yeah, we've got the new shirt locker shirt.

1805
03:06:31.74 --> 03:06:37.26
Oh, yeah, but okay, so how they, how they do that, right? The knockoffs basically

1806
03:06:37.26 --> 03:06:43.98
the counterfeit pirated like design shirts. They go to one of these like internet, yeah, yeah,

1807
03:06:43.98 --> 03:06:49.74
what he called purchase by the restaurant or whatever. No, you can do what he was, his whole

1808
03:06:49.74 --> 03:06:55.26
bad it is if you know about it. And you can, if you just have like half a brain, no offense to

1809
03:06:55.26 --> 03:07:01.10
people who bought those, but you can tell you look at it and it's like this weird like mock-up of

1810
03:07:01.10 --> 03:07:07.42
the design on this real like real like like, what do you see in these, like, model? It's like when you

1811
03:07:07.42 --> 03:07:12.78
buy a metallic a t-shirt like from some dude on the beach, yeah, it looks like there's like plastic

1812
03:07:12.78 --> 03:07:18.06
stickers like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So what I feel bad about is, though,

1813
03:07:18.06 --> 03:07:21.74
is I know that some people are doing like they're like, oh, cool, like I want to support because

1814
03:07:21.74 --> 03:07:25.90
we're like, you like, hey, man, if you want to support what's going on here, then you get some

1815
03:07:25.90 --> 03:07:29.42
get some gear. And so they can actually are stoked like, oh, cool, I'm helping out, you know,

1816
03:07:29.42 --> 03:07:33.58
the podcast we're in the game. And then they realize they're giving their money to some freaky

1817
03:07:33.58 --> 03:07:40.86
savvy, some freaking savage out there. Stop the savage support. Yeah. And they use like super,

1818
03:07:40.86 --> 03:07:46.30
when I say substandard material, it's like, you know, it's like the internet shirt that you print,

1819
03:07:46.30 --> 03:07:51.18
you know, it's like that, then they get that. And they're like, oh, not to mention, there's more

1820
03:07:51.18 --> 03:07:56.62
to it than just that front design. There's a lot more to it. Oh, there's layers, there's little,

1821
03:07:56.62 --> 03:08:00.70
there's little elements of the shirt if you examine it, you're like, okay, I mean the game with this

1822
03:08:00.70 --> 03:08:05.98
shirt, even on a physical level, not to mention the fill, fill this off a cool level, and you don't

1823
03:08:05.98 --> 03:08:11.90
get that either, man. It's brutal. Anyway, if you want, if you want to get involved with the shirt,

1853
03:10:51.02 --> 03:10:54.94
you can send a question. We're going through those questions. We're I'm putting out little um

1854
03:10:55.74 --> 03:11:00.22
other things that I'm diving into. Yeah. And they're interesting because they explain a lot like when

you listen to it and you kind of put it all together. If you don't want to those people, we're like,

comes down and just starts stomping out freedom of speech, we got to have a little

1863
03:11:39.82 --> 03:11:45.02
access port to be able to still do what we're doing and put out the word. We also don't want to have

1864
03:11:45.02 --> 03:11:53.58
a bunch of uh uh sponsors that are saying um, we don't want you to talk about this because we

1865
03:11:53.58 --> 03:11:57.74
think it might be offensive to our brand. We're not doing that. So I'll go underground.com.

1879
03:13:12.06 --> 03:13:16.70
about face by Colonel David Hacworth. You're going through that right now, right? Yep. Three quarters

1880
03:13:16.70 --> 03:13:22.06
of the way through. You're listening to it. Yeah. How's that? I listened to some of it.

1881
03:13:22.06 --> 03:13:28.46
It seems like that guy is a pretty good reader. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. I mean, some of these readers

1882
03:13:28.46 --> 03:13:32.22
are just offensive. Like you listen to him and you're like, this guy is just picked this up for

1883
03:13:32.22 --> 03:13:35.26
the first time. He has no idea what's going on. No context and he's just reading the words on the

1884
03:13:35.26 --> 03:13:43.66
page. I thought that the first like hour, I probably thought, but then some of the things that he wrote

1885
03:13:43.66 --> 03:13:50.06
reminded me of my grandfather so much to where now when I hear it, I hear my grandpa talking because

1886
03:13:50.06 --> 03:13:59.26
he was he was gritty, you know, Korean word gritty and depression gritty. So like I'm hearing him

1887
03:13:59.98 --> 03:14:06.78
tell it how it is and you know, and even like the terminology like he was a good man,

1888
03:14:07.90 --> 03:14:14.14
that was classic, you know, that was classic pop up right there. He's like, you know,

1889
03:14:14.14 --> 03:14:20.38
he was a good man or you know, that that that man's a coward or you know, he was like,

1890
03:14:21.50 --> 03:14:27.82
there was a clear line. You were above it or below it. That was it. Yeah. Yeah. Hackworth. Hackworth

1891
03:14:27.82 --> 03:14:35.26
definitely does that hackworth said this guy, the guys are either studs or studs. No offense.

1892
03:14:37.26 --> 03:14:43.98

it's at knockonTV. Yep. What else? Sounds like YouTube. Knockonartary. Yep. Yeah, just instances not on TV.

1910
03:16:36.86 --> 03:16:42.78
Okay, check. Wait. Twitter might be. Twitter is too. I checked in this morning and Facebook

1911
03:16:42.78 --> 03:16:49.50
looks like that too. Echo, you got anything else? Well, yeah, if like I have kids that I want them to

1912
03:16:49.50 --> 03:16:55.74
get in art into art tree, obviously you have you know, direction for that scenario. Oh yeah. Yep. No,

1913
03:16:55.74 --> 03:17:00.14
same exact thing. Doesn't matter the age group, you know, look for a good shop. See if they have

1914
03:17:00.14 --> 03:17:07.02
a good youth program. If not, then dive down the down the YouTube rattle or, you know, follow in social

1915
03:17:07.02 --> 03:17:13.90
media. Try to give some type of free education, you know, if not every day, every other day.

1916
03:17:13.90 --> 03:17:19.98
I mean, a lot of what I do is just trying to help the archery lifestyle and some form or fashion.

1917
03:17:19.98 --> 03:17:28.86
Is there so I got my son, he's for a foe from Amazon. He, it's, and it's like perfect where he puts a lot of effort

1918
03:17:28.86 --> 03:17:34.62
and then he can pull it back. So I remember pulling a compound bow. No, it's like four. Yeah.

1919
03:17:35.34 --> 03:17:39.10
It's the kind where I pulled it back. I was like, oh, he might not be able to do this. And then what when he

1920
03:17:39.10 --> 03:17:43.82
does it, he can do it. But what's interesting? It's you can suction cups or what's it, you know,

1921
03:17:43.82 --> 03:17:48.62
nerve things or what's it you would? I would say a brothel. I don't, yeah, I don't know about all the

1922
03:17:48.62 --> 03:17:54.38
arrow tips heads. But what is it? What does it, what does it, end of it may it looks, it reminds me of

1923
03:17:54.38 --> 03:17:58.94
looks like, you know, the old school, like, you know, if you have archery class at school, you know,

1924
03:17:58.94 --> 03:18:04.78
the thing, like it's, it's not sharp, but it's made to stick into something. Right. The blunt point.

1925
03:18:04.78 --> 03:18:10.54
Yeah, like a bow. Yeah. But it has a little tip to it kind of nice. But you couldn't like cut yourself,

1926
03:18:10.54 --> 03:18:17.82
just by scrap, just by scrap yourself with that. I don't know. But the question is, like, if I just

1927
03:18:17.82 --> 03:18:23.50
buy a random bow like that, is that like a note, like should I not do that? Or is it, honestly,

1928
03:18:23.50 --> 03:18:29.18
with kids that are that young, just let them freaking watch arrows fly and have fun. Okay. That is

1929
03:18:29.18 --> 03:18:35.18
my mindset. A little back and let it rip. Keep them close. So, you know, I tell people, you know,

1930
03:18:35.18 --> 03:18:41.02
kids like playing games that they always went at. So, you know, if you try to make your kids

1931
03:18:41.02 --> 03:18:46.54
shoot a target at your distance, it's going to be problematic, you know, keep it. Keep a target

1932
03:18:46.54 --> 03:18:50.70
big. Keep them close. If they see themselves hitting in the middle, they don't really make the

1933
03:18:50.70 --> 03:18:57.10
correlation of, well, that target's bigger than dads or this one's closer. You know, if you're

1934
03:18:57.10 --> 03:19:01.18
just like, all right, you know, you shoot for the gold. I'm going to shoot for the gold. Let's,

1935
03:19:01.18 --> 03:19:06.38
you know, and if they're like, I beat you again. I beat you again. That's perfect scenario. Yeah.

1936
03:19:06.38 --> 03:19:11.90
Echo Charles, we started talking about making a warrior kid bow. What do you think? I think

1937
03:19:11.90 --> 03:19:18.30
that that's a great idea. Yeah. What age does kind of kid get like a bow that's freaking like

1938
03:19:18.30 --> 03:19:26.54
a little pretty legit? I think probably by seven or eight, they can be going down the right path

1939
03:19:26.54 --> 03:19:32.14
or you can teach some solid fundamentals and get something set up for them. The up, that's the

1940
03:19:32.14 --> 03:19:37.18
warrior kid age too coincidentally. We might have to keep going down that path. Awesome. Do

1941
03:19:37.18 --> 03:19:43.50
the anything else? I'm good. Right. Awesome. Well, like I said earlier, man, thanks for

1942
03:19:43.50 --> 03:19:47.42
thanks for everything you've done for the archery community. Thanks for what you're doing for all

1943
03:19:47.42 --> 03:19:51.98
the vets all over the place and and really, you know, thanks for what you've done for me. I

1944
03:19:51.98 --> 03:19:56.22
know that you, like I said, silver platter, man, it's been freaking awesome. I appreciate it.

1945
03:19:56.94 --> 03:20:04.70
And all you got back from me was a freaking broke man. And a freaking brown paper sack for instruction.

1946
03:20:04.70 --> 03:20:10.46
Just fit. I think you'd nearly drown. I broke your neck and almost drowned you. I'm from the best.

1947
03:20:10.46 --> 03:20:17.74
I'm just in the sad. He calls his friend, Joshua over to like give me a board. So I'm like,

1948
03:20:17.74 --> 03:20:23.02
oh, man, this is freaking awesome. Like he didn't even like deliver the chair. He like had someone

1949
03:20:23.02 --> 03:20:29.42
else made the chair in and then freaking just threw me into the fricking. See, super freaking

1950
03:20:29.42 --> 03:20:36.70
watching me drown. See, we didn't get that 40 foot leash. That was my, my board wrap around my

1951
03:20:36.70 --> 03:20:45.50
15 times. Yeah. Oh, look, I'm not the best guy in the world. I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts

1952
03:20:45.50 --> 03:20:49.66
back at me. Thanks for telling us everything you learned today. Like I said, it's not just about

1953
03:20:49.66 --> 03:20:54.46
archery. It's about life. It's about business. This is about moving forward. And thanks to your dad

1954
03:20:54.46 --> 03:21:01.10
and his service and and thanks to all the vets out there and thanks to the current service members

1955
03:21:01.10 --> 03:21:05.02
out there around the world protecting our freedom when you get done with that mission, you're going

1956
03:21:05.02 --> 03:21:10.86
to need a new mission. Check out some archery, man. It's good for you. And to the people out there

1957
03:21:10.86 --> 03:21:17.50
in service, here at home to police law enforcement firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

1958
03:21:17.50 --> 03:21:21.98
correctional officers, board of patrol, secret service and all the other first responders.

1959
03:21:22.86 --> 03:21:30.78
Thanks for protecting us in our times of need and to everyone else out there. Just remember that

1960
03:21:30.78 --> 03:21:39.26
bow hunting is like life. The wind don't come easy and you don't always win. You don't always win.

1961
03:21:40.78 --> 03:21:47.26
But you still have to prepare. You still have to get the reps. You still have to go through the process

1962
03:21:47.26 --> 03:21:56.38
and you have to keep going. Keep trying to improve so that you can get what you are after.

1963
03:21:56.38 --> 03:22:03.50
And until next time, this is John Dudley, Enico and Jocco out.
