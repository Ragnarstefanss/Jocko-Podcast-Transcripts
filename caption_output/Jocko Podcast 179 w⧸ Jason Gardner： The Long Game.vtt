00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.50
This is Jockel podcast number 179, with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

2
00:00:06.50 --> 00:00:09.50
Good evening echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:09.50 --> 00:00:20.50
So, the spear dains and days gone by and the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness.

4
00:00:20.50 --> 00:00:26.000
We have heard of those princes, heroic campaigns.

5
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000
There was shield sheafs in, scourge of many tribes, a record of meat, benches, rampaging among foes.

6
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This terror of the hall troops had come far.

7
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000
A fowlling to start with, he would flourish later on, as his powers waxed and his worth was proved.

8
00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:03.000
In the end, each clan on outline coasts beyond the whale road had to yield to him and begin to pay tribute.

9
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
That was one good king.

10
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Boom.

11
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Opening with a little bit of bear wolf and that is the opening of bear wolf, translated by Shemest Haney.

12
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:32.000
What I notice is even back in the day in the opening of the original old English poem, the first one written.

13
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
What are they talking about? They're talking about war and they're talking about leadership.

14
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And you can hear in the beginning he was a little bit of a weak leader. He was a foundling to start with.

15
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
But he would flourish later on, became a good king.

16
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And that's what happens. You learn, you get better.

17
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And that is why we talk about war and leadership here and speaking of war and leadership back for a third time.

18
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000
My brother, Jason Gardner, retired, Master Chief, who I've known since I got into the teams in the early 90s.

19
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
He's been on the podcast before.

20
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
If you haven't listened to 167 and 168, go listen to those first.

21
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
There's a lot of ground covered in those podcasts.

22
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And I told him to listen in and listen to him again and see which what we missed.

23
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So we can go back and that's what we're going to do now.

24
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Cover some more ground, hit some of that stuff that we missed.

25
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So welcome back, Jason.

26
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Thank you.

27
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Check.

28
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
When I first got that translation, which was actually when I was in college, and it starts off with.

29
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So, by just saying, oh my god, this is literally legit.

30
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So I start things with so a lot now when I write, I do that.

31
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I do that.

32
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So yeah, welcome back.

33
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
How's retirement treating you?

34
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Good to go.

35
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I was going to say awesome, but I'd be awesome, absolutely, two death in the last two podcasts.

36
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So I'm going to try and ban it.

37
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Did you have a cell phone, California, childhood, creep out with some awesome.

38
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Yes.

39
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Everything is awesome.

40
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Yep.

41
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So you're going to watch out for that.

42
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So what do we miss?

43
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I don't miss something from your youth.

44
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Where are you talking about the best show you ever saw?

45
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
The best punk rock show you ever saw?

46
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Yeah.

47
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
There was a one that, and this is before I could even drive,

48
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
buddy, a mine just in Hawkins and Alicio went up to this, this gig at Cyprus College.

49
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And it was DI, plain rap, the Dickies, the Vandals, the Circle Jerks.

50
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
There might have been one other band for seven dollars in pre-sale.

51
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Yeah.

52
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So we got pre-sale tickets.

53
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
We went up there.

54
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
God in, there was probably about 500 people outside who weren't able to get in,

55
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
because it sold out.

56
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
So they just went ahead and knocked the doors down and all flooded in.

57
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So what that meant was nobody got searched coming in for security.

58
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And people had crazy stuff like firecrackers.

59
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
It was way overcrowded for, you know, what the safe, safe amount for the building was.

60
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So when you went up by where the doors were, the security guys had just put,

61
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
pushed all these tables and chairs and we're sitting on them up against the doors to keep anybody else from coming in.

62
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And the, the show was just unreal.

63
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
There were three mosh pits.

64
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And then when the Circle Jerks came out, they opened up with wild on the streets.

65
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
The whole floor exploded.

66
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
One of the pits started floating, crashed into another pit.

67
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
People were throwing bricks of firecrackers around.

68
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
It was mass band amounting with so much fun.

69
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And so you were like 14 or 15?

70
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
15 years old.

71
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Yeah.

72
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
My mom had dropped me off.

73
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I dropped this off there.

74
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Oh, that's awesome.

75
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Yeah, she's got to go.

76
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
That's great away.

77
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Yeah.

78
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Because a lot of times if your parents, if parents try to shield their kids from that,

79
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
or they won't let them go, then you would have just snuck out.

80
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
They would have never known where.

81
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Yep.

82
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And gotten in trouble when you rebelled against it.

83
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Right.

84
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Yeah.

85
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
That happens if your parents try to control you too much.

86
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
It's kind of like with any person, right?

87
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
You try to control them too much.

88
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Then they get out of control.

89
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
They rebelling against you.

90
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Right.

91
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Which is a discussion I think I was having the other day with your daughter about people just trying to box people in.

92
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And it's another example of over centralized command.

93
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Yes, it is.

94
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Too much.

95
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Too much stuff like that.

96
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
They're just going to go the other way.

97
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
I was actually talking about this with a leader in a company.

98
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I was just explaining because you like for sure money drives people compensation drives people.

99
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000
But ability to choose your fate or have some influence over your fate is it also very powerful,

100
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
motivator and incentive for people to follow.

101
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So when you have a like if you have one job where you make more money,

102
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
but you don't have any freedom, you don't have to control over your own fate.

103
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Versus a job where you get paid last money, but you have really a lot of autonomy.

104
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Most people will go with your autonomy.

105
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
There are rare people that don't want any autonomy.

106
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
They just pretty much want to get told, hey, give me my paycheck.

107
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I'll do whatever you tell me to do and that's fine.

108
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And they're not into their job, but a lot of people,

109
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
the more autonomy you give them, the more into it they are, the more they enjoy what they're doing.

110
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Whereas if you're just micromanage them or centralized command scenario,

111
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
they're not into it and that's a problem.

112
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And at the first person you gave the example of probably exercises know what initiative whatsoever.

113
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Exactly.

114
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
But you have to address that. You have to address that when the work with companies

115
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
that there are people that they just want to get their paycheck.

116
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
They're going to punch the clock at 4.59 every day and that's the way it is.

117
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
They don't want to get promoted. They're fine with that.

118
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And so you've got to know and you'll answer those people always is,

119
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
if you're leading someone like that, okay, you know what you've got,

120
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
get the most out of them, take good care of them,

121
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and they'll do their job well and you know you can count on them for that.

122
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So that's fine. There's nothing wrong with that.

123
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Just that somebody that does have higher goals or different goals,

124
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I guess where they want to break out of that,

125
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
then you've got to give them the opportunity.

126
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And those people, if you box them in, they're going to rebel against you.

127
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
You've got to look out. They'll be like Jason Gardner, age 15 with a mohawk.

128
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Check, check.

129
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So I don't want to the other things that you wanted to talk about a little bit

130
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
was Scotty Words.

131
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
That's right. You know, and just coming after right after Memorial Day,

132
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
it's really fitting to discuss him.

133
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Scotty was a good friend of mine, just a fantastic team guy.

134
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:57.000
He did six years in the teams and then separated 2005 and he did what a lot of guys did at the time.

135
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Was he started contracting overseas because he wanted to be at that point of friction.

136
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And for Scotty, I don't think he was ever ever happier than when he was at that point of friction.

137
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So he did a bunch of contracting.

138
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
He wound up getting hired by the Defense Intelligence Agency as a, as a GES position,

139
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
a full-time position.

140
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And then January, this last January, he was killed by a suicide bomber when he was out operating in Syria.

141
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And I remember when I got the text message, we were all in a group text that he passed.

142
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And I just, man, it kind of floored me for a second.

143
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:46.000
But then, you know, it's like Scotty died doing what he loved.

144
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And he was just such, he was a maniac in the best sense of the word.

145
00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Like the hardest I've ever laughed in my life is with him. And most people will tell you that any time they've had a good belly laugh or something,

146
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
he was whisked Scotty.

147
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And he had that kind of contagious smile where you look at pictures and Seth is a lot like this one.

148
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I look at Seth's pictures.

149
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:17.000
He's got that smile that just has that special thing about it that automatically makes you use smile.

150
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:25.000
You know, you are not ever going to be the voice or reason and you are always going to be a good time and you're a good friend.

151
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And so, while there's, there's a remorse that he's not here anymore, I'm so fired up that I got to spend the time with him that I did.

152
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And so anyway, I mean, there you really have it. He passed. He's from St. Louis, so they had a big funeral form there.

153
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And it was at this Catholic cathedral. There had to be a thousand people inside that cathedral. And it was raining the day they had it.

154
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So the funeral possession from the cathedral to the military cemetery where they buried him had to be like at least 30 miles.

155
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Every single overpass on the freeway on the drive there had fire trucks and first responders out on it.

156
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:26.000
The freeway, they shut the freeway down. Every exit was stopped by police officers, which is pretty pretty dang cool.

157
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:41.000
So then when we got off the freeway and we were driving on the surface streets, people, the people as St. Louis just pulled their cars over and they were standing at attention out in the rain.

158
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And so it's moving when someone in uniform does that, but you almost kind of expect that out of them.

159
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:59.000
But when you see like a 30 year old mother of two and or two like eight year old kid in seven year old kid.

160
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Standing at attention with their hands in the heart over their hearts in the rain and it was a cold rain.

161
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
As he went by, it's just.

162
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:20.000
It's an amazing and humbling experience to see that kind of love and respect by the people of this country and the people of St. Louis.

163
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Yeah, that's awesome.

164
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Well, I was with with Chris Kyle's procession going down to where he was buried and that was a long drive.

165
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I want to say it was a few hours.

166
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And the entire thing and again it was raining same thing, we're in Texas, but it's raining and sure enough.

167
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:49.000
I mean there was people were lying the entire way and I was riding with one other guy and it was just and we were in this massive there was a massive procession of people.

168
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000
But it was just I remember sitting there for a long time and just the windshield wipers just going back and forth.

169
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:13.000
We were not talking because there's nothing to say you can't you can't put words to that you know you can't put words to thousands of people standing out in the rain with their hands on their hearts just every bridge fire trucks flags hung up from the ladders extended.

170
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Yeah, this the same same type of feeling that that I had when I was doing that and it definitely makes you realize that regardless of all the.

171
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:38.000
What do they say these days that America is division all this division that everyone talks about there's plenty of people that that understand what it when it takes to keep this country free for sure.

172
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Absolutely, I feel like it's such a small and maybe vocal minority.

173
00:12:44.000 --> 00:13:02.000
That's out there and I don't think it's on a whole I think we're we're on even though a lot of us have our differences and I think we're figuring out how to discuss politics just by looking at how people discuss stuff on social media and.

174
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
People were dialing it in and they're they're able to have.

175
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Realistic discussions with each other without getting too hateful and there's some people that are still figure in that out.

176
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000
For sure, I'll say two things about that I was on I was on Ben Shapiro's podcast.

177
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Yeah, and you know Ben was like and Ben's a real nice guy he's you know very nice to me and and all that and he's you know he's.

178
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:36.000
What's pretty cool about him is he's he's like got this running list of everything that he said that's stupid or wrong or whatever he's me a culpa list.

179
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:48.000
But anyways, yes, we were having this conversation he was hinting at the fact of this massive division and you know these the massive right against the massive left and and you know I said listen man.

180
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:58.000
I travel the our whole country all the time I work with construction companies with finance companies with now you do too insurance companies.

181
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And we meet people from every different industry. I said these people aren't on the extreme right they're not on the extreme left their common sense their Americans and I said you Ben you're.

182
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:25.000
You're like here at at ground zero for political like mayhem and so what do you expect to see like you're you're the you're the lightning rod for a lot of this stuff and so that's what you hear.

183
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Normal America. It didn't really like that you know it's just not I'm out there all the time you're out there all the time now you know you see it no one's coming up to you saying.

184
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:45.000
You know with some extreme views are there small number people share on both sides yes absolutely but in general people are realizing oh well that's not a bad point and then I was on.

185
00:14:45.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Brian Coppimon's podcast and we were talking about the same thing and what's interesting is you know Ben Shapiro's pretty pretty far on the right and and Brian Coppimon's pretty far on the left and me I think they're both really nice guys that are super cool and but what I said to him was.

186
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:23.000
You know what what what you're saying what I believe is leading to the attitude kind of shifting is. Basically this. If you're not humble and you think you know everything then why should I listen to anything that you say you know why should if I'm on the far left why should I listen to anything I know everything and everyone on the right is wrong.

187
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:47.000
If I'm on the far right why should I listen to anyone that anyone said anything that anyone saying on the other side I know everything. If you're humble and you say you know what I got some ideas but I'm probably not 100% right you know maybe I'm only 98% right no if you just look at other people and say oh you know what I probably don't have the full solution for this maybe I should listen to other people's opinions and try and try and come up with a.

188
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:59.000
A more broad base idea than just what I think so I think people are starting to realize if you take one extreme view and you don't want anyone else than you're wrong.

189
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And so I think people are becoming a little bit more balanced I certainly hope I yeah and and I know that that I've got some really really close friends that are on both ends of the spectrum.

190
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I'm going to go down with them and have a logical conversation with them I find out that our values.

191
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Yeah are the they're the same yeah and really it's just a lot of misrepresentation and some unfortunate semantics sometimes that you know drawn us to different directions or put us on different sides.

192
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Speaking of the left hand and the right hand.

193
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Yeah.

194
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000
This is you gotta tell the story about and this is this is a good revealing story about.

195
00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:01.000
I've I I'll lead to oftentimes the dark sense of humor in the teams and there's a dark sense of humor in the military and you kind of have to have a dark sense of humor.

196
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And I think did you see the movie range 15? No. Oh okay it's it's about it's just a crazy movie that Tim Kennedy and and Matt best and the black rifle coffee company.

197
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Yeah, they all those guys.

198
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
They throw the keys to the girl.

199
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Yeah, yeah, it's just it's just every horrible dark joke that you can make they make and I don't know how well it did or whatever it did good enough.

200
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:39.000
I'm sure to fend a lot of people. I'm sure to fend it a lot of people but they they did it so good for good on him but.

201
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:48.000
You know you talk about that kind of dark sense of humor and I think this story which you like called me I don't know whatever it was six months ago or whatever you go.

202
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:58.000
I got to tell you a story which whenever you call me and tell me that I get super excited I tell my kids to leave the room and I put you on speaker phone and I put you on speaker phone and then I mute.

203
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000
So I don't but it's under interrupt you by laughing so hard because whenever you call me tell me got a good story I'm thinking here we go.

204
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:15.000
So yeah tell us about the hand. So and and I talked to Aaron Kendall this morning to make sure I got the details correct.

205
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:27.000
So Aaron Kendall's a seal that was working at the training detachment when I was the commander master chief there and he is on a hunting trip out in Texas like a foundation supported hunting trip.

206
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000
And he's driving one of those side by sides out to where he's going to hunt like side by side at TV.

207
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Yeah like an ATV try like one of those razors right and it rolls and it's smacked the roll bar smashes his left arm.

208
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:53.000
So he makes a turnic it out of his belt and walks like a mile back to the rainhouse and then they call the.

209
00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:03.000
They try to call life light life light can't come out to foggy they get an ambulance comes and get some they start driving them up towards to a hospital at San Antonio.

210
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Now he's in the hospital they wind up having an apiotaid is left hand in the hospital.

211
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
In this first hospital. Why is that?

212
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Because it was just completely. So smashed. Yeah, his arm was just smashed. It was done. He was losing so much blood through there and they they ended up like.

213
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:31.000
They kind of had to fight to save the amputation below his elbow because they were worried that because later on in surgeries are taking more and more.

214
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:41.000
So there were a couple other team guys that were there and other team guys flew in to help out and they're staying at this hotel right outside the hospital where he's at.

215
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000
So they take him from where he was they take him to this hospital. He's at this hospital and at that hospital they have to amputate his hand.

216
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:57.000
So he's bedside talking with the other with some other seals and they're the surgeon who amputate his hand is in their checking on him and they asked the surgeon hey.

217
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Do you guys still have his hand.

218
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:12.000
And the surgeon says yeah, I think so. I don't you know we haven't destroyed and they asked him what are you going to do with it and they goes well, you know, I guess they destroyed or whatever.

219
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
And so Aaron asks, what can I have my hand.

220
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
And the surgeon says.

221
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:27.000
I'll go check. So he goes and checks with the administrators right and they they come back and they say yeah, you get to fill out these forms, but we'll give you the hand.

222
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
So they fill out the forms. They give the hand to.

223
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:41.000
One of the other seals actually receives a hand because Aaron now has has had to move to a different hospital. That's a little bit better to deal with the applications.

224
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
And they've got his hand with the intent to take it to a taxidermist.

225
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000
So in the meantime, they're keeping it in the the freezer of the hotel.

226
00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:05.000
And they're taking turns spending time with Aaron. So guy will be there at the hospital with Aaron while he's in the other hospital and other guys at the hotel and they're flipping back and forth.

227
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Which is a little testament to like, well, the way it is for team guys are just looking out for him.

228
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
So you get here in the hospital, what's something to stay with you 24 hours and it's awesome.

229
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Right. So one of the guys that's back at the hotel room.

230
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:28.000
He's got to go somewhere and he wants to put the hand in the other guys freezer or he's going to play a joke on one of the other guys and put the hand in his bed.

231
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:38.000
And so he comes up with these different rooms to try and get the hotel staff to let him into the room and they're not having any of it because he looks kind of shady.

232
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
And he's a team guy.

233
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:48.000
So he's telling him, okay, you know my friend left his phone in the room and I get in there and they're like, well, no, or hey, well, no, actually wasn't his phone. It was his ID.

234
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
And I need to go like all that stuff.

235
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
That kind of shot in the balcony.

236
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Let's check her criminal.

237
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Yes. So then he leaves to go to the hospital, I guess.

238
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
But they're suspect.

239
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
They're suspect.

240
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
The poor maid goes in there and finds a hand in the freezer.

241
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
He did, I have a picture of it. It's horrible.

242
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
It's all gray and just like ripped off right there.

243
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
So Adams family style.

244
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Yes.

245
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
And so they, of course, call the police.

246
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
The police show up and they just detain everybody.

247
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Of course.

248
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Of course.

249
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
And then errands in the hospital and all the nurses come up.

250
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
And they're like, hey, all these police are calling here. They need to talk to you something about your hand.

251
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
So he's got to get on the phone and explain to the police why his hand is in the thing.

252
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
I think they probably validated something with the doctor too.

253
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
And you know, calm them down that this wasn't some kind of murder.

254
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Yeah.

255
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
And then they kind of settled everything.

256
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
They threw everybody out of the motel.

257
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Aaron gave his hand to the taxidermist.

258
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
He had a nice, what they call European Mount were the taxidermist.

259
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
And Texas is awesome.

260
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
So they, they mounted like the skeleton hand is in this really cool,

261
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Mount inside glass all done up for him.

262
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:16.000
And Aaron just had, he had the best sense of humor about the whole thing.

263
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
You know, if you're going to get depressed, I mean,

264
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
losing a limb is a pretty good way to do it.

265
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
You know, and a lot of ways, he's like, some of the stuff you see out of guys like, you know,

266
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Travis Mills, where it's just funny.

267
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
You're not guys like that.

268
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
You're not going to bum him out.

269
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Just going to keep him going.

270
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
But yeah.

271
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Yes, you're cool.

272
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
So then that's obviously one of, is like one of many stories.

273
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
How does that translate to like when you're dealing with your,

274
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
with your family? Like so, for instance,

275
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
my wife, when I went ahead to go to college, I had to go to the University of San Diego.

276
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
And so it's my first time in my adult life that I wasn't like in a poll tune.

277
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
And so I was, I, I didn't really think about it, but in all of a sudden,

278
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
I didn't have anyone to like attack verbally all day.

279
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Because when you're a single-patoon, it's just constant, you know, attack and combat, verbal combat.

280
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Sometimes physical combat.

281
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
And so when I would come home from school, of course, there's my wife.

282
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
And I want to have some verbal sparring matches.

283
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
So I start hacking away after, you know.

284
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
And finally after three months, she goes, she goes, she goes, she goes, she's a,

285
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
she says, hey, I'm not a teen guy, you know.

286
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
And when she said that to me, it instantly, I instantly realized exactly what she was talking about.

287
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
And I knew she was 100% right.

288
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
I can't treat my wife as if she's a E5 and a sealant.

289
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
And especially like the weapons cleaning table.

290
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
When we're all stuck there cleaning weapons,

291
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:56.000
when guys would just, that's when the youth look for weaknesses in any spot in any guy and just start pick, pick, pick, pick, and waitin' for the reaction.

292
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Yeah.

293
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
He spends so much time with people.

294
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
And so much time just waiting.

295
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000
You know, it's a hurry up and wait thing.

296
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
So, oh, what are we going to do on a four-hour fan ride?

297
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
No.

298
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
We're going to destroy someone, get into a fight,

299
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
spill Cheetos everywhere, you know, just like total chaos and mayhem.

300
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
But yeah, it's all about that.

301
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:27.000
But that, but I guess what I'm asking is, I know, you know, Iris obviously had to get what's the word indoctrinated into the life of beat.

302
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Because you know, I met my wife when I was pretty young.

303
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Yeah.

304
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
And you were not that young.

305
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
No.

306
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
And so you, you know, you, how that work out?

307
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Well, the ideal wife, the, I don't say ideal, I don't know, I don't know, poor Iris listen to this, but the square to wait, let's say that, just square to wait, spouse.

308
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
You know what I'm saying?

309
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Was that look like it?

310
00:25:46.000 --> 00:26:01.000
So I got to go back to, if you look at my career and you know this, because you said this to her one is you on the podcast, like, she's the best thing that ever happened to me.

311
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Oh, yeah.

312
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:10.000
She's completely squared away. And it's because she's so solid and independent.

313
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:17.000
And so there was never ever any aspect of me having to worry about the home front.

314
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:24.000
And there's a constant, she's like very dialed in and challenges me.

315
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Like a lot of my, I had a lot of like pretty far right political views.

316
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:47.000
And then when we sit down and have discussions and stuff, she's really open my aperture up on that, but you know, you look at her history where she, she worked on ranches where she was the only female Wrangler with a whole bunch of cowboys.

317
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:59.000
So she, she got it. She had that aspect of what it's what it's like to be around and then a brown guy's and then when I'd be messing with her like that, you know, she just same deal is Helen.

318
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Let me know.

319
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Let's put you in check.

320
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Basically.

321
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Yeah. And the, you know, this, this job that we have where we're constantly going forward in harm's way.

322
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000
And there, I chose my words kind of partly on the last podcast when I was talking about her.

323
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
I said that she put up with a lot of stuff that other women wouldn't.

324
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000
And that, that gives the indication that she tolerated a lot of shenanigans negative.

325
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:40.000
She was the strength that she had to have to be home while I was on combat deployments and then deal with me when I came back.

326
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
That strength.

327
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Most, most women just can't deal with that kind of lifestyle.

328
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
And don't have that kind of, what were the words that you used on the last podcast?

329
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
She put up with a lot of stuff.

330
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Yeah, I said, you know, yeah, yeah.

331
00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:03.000
And so that, that was a really poor choice of words because it indicates like she was just a pushover and she is an absolutely not a pushover.

332
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Yeah.

333
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:11.000
It, it's more, yeah, it's more like she had the strength to contend with the, the, the hard life that it is.

334
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Exactly.

335
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Being married to some guy that's going on constant deployment and isn't around a lot.

336
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
And then when they're gone, by the way, they might die.

337
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
They might come back horribly wounded whatever and you sign up for that as well.

338
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:32.000
And she's working long hours and raising two little kids while I'm going on six month deployments.

339
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Yeah.

340
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:43.000
And then she's she also, like, and, and I pretty much, I stayed in contact with, with her pretty often.

341
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
So we, we, we pretty much talked at least three times a week.

342
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Three times a week on deployment.

343
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000
And, um, and that's the model it worked for us.

344
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
I've described it and I forget who I described it to is emotional independence.

345
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Like my wife had, has and had enough emotional independence that she was going to run the show.

346
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:15.000
If I'm not there, it's not freaking out, you know, and I think that's, if you're going to look for a, a good spouse, they got to be,

347
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
you can't be, they can't be codependent, right?

348
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Co-dependent is actually actually like a bad thing, right?

349
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
I mean, that's an, an actual bad thing, right?

350
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Co-dependency.

351
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
So yeah.

352
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000
So, but if you go to the other end of the spectrum or not, maybe, I don't know, maybe there's, I guess we go too far on that spectrum.

353
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Then you get to where, hey, I don't even, oh, you're gone.

354
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
I didn't, I wasn't aware of that.

355
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Sorry, I'm over here doing my own thing.

356
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
So you, but you got to find a good strong balance.

357
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Probably leaning towards independent in my opinion.

358
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
You got to be leaning towards independent.

359
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Because if you're not leaning towards independent, I mean, when you don't get the, you know,

360
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
it sucks being here by yourself for six months.

361
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
It's not a true partnership.

362
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
If, if, if they're not equal, right?

363
00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
If you're kind of not equal footing and one person really needs the other one,

364
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:07.000
then then the partnership aspect of it is, it's not there.

365
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Yeah, that's a, that's something to pay attention to.

366
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Because the thing that's kind of weird is when your young guys get suckered into the being,

367
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
it's, it feels all, empowering to have someone that's all dependent on you.

368
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
You're saying, oh, yeah.

369
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000
When you're young and you got the girl and she's all dependent on you and the world revolves around you.

370
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
And then when you're not there, she's falling apart and you feel, oh, yeah, I'm the man.

371
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000
And so it's easy, I think that I've seen that happen a lot where guys get suckered into those situations.

372
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
And that's not a good situation to get.

373
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
It never works out because they're like, who's, well, and then she's in a situation,

374
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000
if it's that kind of girl, she's going to find someone else to take care of her while you're not there to take care of her.

375
00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:02.000
And then the case with Iris is like, we're inside the same box as far as,

376
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
just the things that we enjoy where we want to be in the outdoors.

377
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
It's, it's all the same thing.

378
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000
So, you know, it's like I said in my retirement ceremony when I look, look, I look at the trajectory of my career.

379
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:22.000
And then when Iris and I became together, I went from Platoon Chief to Master Chief first time up every time.

380
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:30.000
And just hammered it because she was a good partner and she drove me to be better.

381
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
And as always, drive me to be better.

382
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
It helps to have somebody that's super square the way like that.

383
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
You know what that does? It forces you like you're not there's doing it for yourself.

384
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Because it's easy, sometimes easier to let yourself down, right?

385
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Yeah, it's easier to let yourself down, the no let down, this person that's looking at you thinking,

386
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
hey, you could do better than that. Come on.

387
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Are you serious right now?

388
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
And that's the kind of stuff that you'll say to me.

389
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
You know, she's very straightforward and I'll be going, I'll just say, check.

390
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Got it. And then we've gone to the point where we can give each other pretty honest feedback without

391
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
there being any resentment involved.

392
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
I've been pretty straightforward with Iris on some things.

393
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
We're working on some projects together.

394
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Yep.

395
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
And it's pretty cool for me to be able to just be real straightforward with her.

396
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Yeah.

397
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
And she's like, no, tell me.

398
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Well, actually, no, how does she says it? She says, no go ahead and tell me.

399
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Yep.

400
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Sheh, sheh. So, you know, speaking of Afghanistan, you're, you did the last time you were on.

401
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
You know, we, we breeze through Afghanistan pretty quick.

402
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:50.000
But that was actually a, a really, pretty big deployment in terms of what you guys did there.

403
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Yep.

404
00:32:51.000 --> 00:33:01.000
And I know there were some details that you wanted to get into on some of those operations and some of the things that you brought home from those operations.

405
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Lessons learned, et cetera.

406
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000
I mean, you were talking about one earlier, talking about the modules and bringing them modules.

407
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
That's it. That's a, that's a good piece of gear to bring out on an operation.

408
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Yeah.

409
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
And usually you got a marked on mountain on top of a truck.

410
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000
But, um, when we did that, that operation as Frago 6 and C.

411
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Gengin, and we actually went into Marsha.

412
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:35.000
And the element that I was with was in a blocking position that was looking down a road that ran east west.

413
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
And we were the furthest east positions. So we're blocking position on, on that direction.

414
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000
And where we got dropped off was really close to where we were going to stay for four days.

415
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
So we were, you know, we brought a mortar in.

416
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:57.000
We brought the, the M2 HP, the heavy barrel 50 kelm machine gun with the big tripod for everything.

417
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000
How do you break that up? How many guys have carried out?

418
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
That's a lot of weight to carry man.

419
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
You touched about the M. UNISHING and the weapon and the tripod.

420
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Well, ammunition got paired dropped into us, but the initial, the initial insert.

421
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:18.000
We had an ATV on the helicopter and a lot of that stuff was loaded on the ATV.

422
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Plus we were inserted maybe 200 yards from the position.

423
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Everything was kicked out of the hellow, staged.

424
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
We went and cleared the building and then hauled everything over there and set it up.

425
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
And we done all the, you know, the imagery set up for, okay, here's what we're going to be.

426
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Here's where our firing lanes, all that stuff was pretty much set up ahead of time.

427
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Once you guys were doing that, we started the guys and trade it.

428
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Well, that we were putting through training started doing it started, Karen, man.

429
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
There was some big team guy.

430
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Oh, he just got back from deployment.

431
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
He, I know exactly who he was talking to.

432
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
He was talking to the 50 cow like he looked like he was carrying a 60.

433
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
He did.

434
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
And it was a legit, good to watch.

435
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000
His nickname was pigna.

436
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
His nickname was pigna.

437
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
And he's a beast.

438
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
I know he's listening.

439
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Good on you.

440
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
That's one of one of my favorite nicknames.

441
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
You don't have some feature about you that gets noticed in the

442
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Dames, because everyone's going to call you by some weird name.

443
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000
And the funny thing about him is he is super, he's a big guy and he's super intelligent.

444
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Yeah, good.

445
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Good guy.

446
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Everywhere you measure it.

447
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
So we set this thing up in a window.

448
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:35.000
And, you know, inside, so just the barrel was sticking out and of, of the compound that we were holding.

449
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Aiming right down the east west road, because our biggest fear is a vehicle born ID coming down that road.

450
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:52.000
And along across that road, there was this, there was like a headrow and there was a little irrigation ditch over there.

451
00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:00.000
And so the Taliban kept coming down that headrow and firing at us from the trees.

452
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:08.000
And then just put that 50 on the tree line, stitch it like at shin level, because that would be

453
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Chester a little bit high level for somebody in the ditch and just send a belt all the way down and back.

454
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
And then push them back further.

455
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Well, at one point, some guys had come up from a different direction and they were getting really, really close in the tree line.

456
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
Bad guys.

457
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Bad guys.

458
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
And we could not traverse the gun over far enough.

459
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
So we tried to shove it out the window.

460
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
It wouldn't go out the window.

461
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
So me and that EOD warn officer who is with us.

462
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:48.000
And then one of my E5s who right now he's a true BSEA over at one of the seal teams.

463
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Check.

464
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Drug lifting out and put it in the street.

465
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:59.000
And just started laying it down. So we got the 50 cows set up in the street right out in front of our compound.

466
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
And for a second there, we were taking heavy fire.

467
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Pretty heavy fire.

468
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:12.000
P.K. Ampfire, but it was all going a little bit high and we just kept stitching, stitching, and then they were done.

469
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000
They broke contact.

470
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
They did not like that big gun.

471
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000
In fact, the next day it kind of slowed down for us because they didn't want to come.

472
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:29.000
They did. They're like, ah, we'll find a different direction because we were holding, you know, basically four square blocks.

473
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
So they started penetrating in from different directions.

474
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000
The later on two days later, guys pushed out to another building.

475
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
That was about a hundred yards in front of the position.

476
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:49.000
And they got into a little tick up there. So we started lighting up the area that we thought they were taking fire from.

477
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:57.000
And the 50 cow was so loud that they thought that they were taking direct fire from the 50 cow when we were shooting.

478
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
So the rounds passing by that.

479
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000
On the rounds passing by them, we're so loud and knocking dust off the wall.

480
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
That's how I was saying, I can't even imagine what it would be like to be in a building.

481
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
And you know, that one situation that Tony was in where the someone's lighting your building up with several hundred rounds.

482
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Yeah, no, the blue on blue situation. Those guys put 150 rounds into 150 rounds of 50 cow from total.

483
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
I don't know, 20 meters away.

484
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
I mean, from the corner, it was a building on the corner and they stopped in the corner and just shot.

485
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
And those guys coming out of that building after we got thing under control.

486
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
I mean, I kicked up on the door. I saw Tony there.

487
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
And then, but the and Tony looked pretty much just like normal Tony.

488
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Yeah, everyone else in that building looked like they just saw death.

489
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000
And they actually just did see death. I mean, they're in a building.

490
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
They get 150 rounds of 50 cow.

491
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
The guy that was on the roof, he was, he, he was telling me, he was telling me there's like a year ago.

492
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Like we were just talking about and he goes, he goes, yeah, I got out my pistol.

493
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
I, a hundred percent thought that we were going to get overrun and I was going to die.

494
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
If I didn't just take around through the concrete into my head.

495
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Right.

496
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Yeah.

497
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
So did they know it was blue and blue?

498
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Or did they think that they were just getting hammered by the fire?

499
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:15.000
No, it's just like, one of the, one of the, one of the many little, like, components of this.

500
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000
So that guy, the guy that was on the roof top that I was talking to, 12 hours before.

501
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
He was in another position.

502
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:29.000
And he got lit up with a disco, a 12.7 millimeter, you know, weapon, which is the,

503
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
so we had a equivalent of the 50 cow for those of you who don't know.

504
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
He got lit up with that and hit with RPGs.

505
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
So he said, I remember it, as soon as you know, as soon as this was all over, we got back to base.

506
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
That's another thing he told me, but he told me this way back then, he said, he said to himself,

507
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
I can't believe the guy with the disco found me again.

508
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
He was so, and we were only, you know, a couple days before.

509
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.000
And that same guy, so when he got lit up here, he was in this, he was on camp

510
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
and he was in an Overwatch position looking for ID in places.

511
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
He's sitting there on his sniper rifle.

512
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:10.000
And all of a sudden, he starts taking machine gunfire, and it's, it's a disco.

513
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
And then he gets hit with a couple RPGs.

514
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Well, I'm inside with the company commander from, from one of the companies from the first to 506.

515
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
And we were planning an operation that we're doing the next day.

516
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
So we started hearing gunfire.

517
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000
And all of a sudden we hear RPGs boom, boom.

518
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
And I said to, the machine gunfire starts,

519
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000
and he goes, oh, listen, I'm going to contact him.

520
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
And I go, hey, my sniper is up there. Don't worry about it.

521
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Like just jacco the badass, right?

522
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Yes.

523
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
And all of a sudden boom, boom.

524
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
So we hear the RPGs say, so we go running outside.

525
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000
And I'm still just, I say, hey, don't worry.

526
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
My guy's got this in, right as those words are coming out of my mouth.

527
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Out of the bottom of the sniper tower,

528
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
because we, we were right next to it.

529
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Out of the bottom of the sniper tower, out pours that guy.

530
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
I'm sure we'll be on the podcast one day.

531
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
He comes pouring out of the tower.

532
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
His weapon, his sniper gun had been blown like the stock up blown off, bro.

533
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000
I'd be RPG.

534
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
And he just looks like, oh my god.

535
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000
You know what I said?

536
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Okay, well, maybe not.

537
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
It was horrible.

538
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
But so that's the guy when they're getting, when they're getting shot up with 50 cow.

539
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Yeah.

540
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
He just thought, and the rest of the guys do,

541
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
because everyone knew that this had happened, and we briefed it, hey,

542
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
hey, just imagine the, the PLO going out to this,

543
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
I'm saying, hey guys, these guys have

544
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Dishka 12.7 millimeter anti aircraft gun out there.

545
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
So be ready for some significant heavy weapons.

546
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
And sure enough, that's the guy on the rooftop thinking to himself,

547
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
I can't believe this guy with a disco founding.

548
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Yeah.

549
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Man.

550
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000
And that was one of the big lessons learned

551
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000
when I got to trade at where guys would put 50 rounds of 50 cow

552
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
into a building with planks, you know,

553
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
simulating combat.

554
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000
And then we'd have a trade at guy in there that would get up and shoot someone.

555
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
And they'd be like, that's bullshit.

556
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Yeah.

557
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
You know what, guy, that would never happen.

558
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
And I'm like, oh, yes, it would happen.

559
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
You know, we had guys survive 25 millimeter chain gun

560
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
from from Bradley's and still stumble out of,

561
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
you know, not friendlies, right, not not for me,

562
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
but we know there was an enemy that made it out of buildings

563
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
that had whatever, however many rounds a bunch of 25 millimeter chain gun rounds

564
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
coming out of the building or coming to your building and they'd still live.

565
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
So you don't know what's going to happen with bullets, you know?

566
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
You just don't.

567
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
No.

568
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
It's hard to tell.

569
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
And that, yeah, the frustration and the blame casting that goes on

570
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000
some of that training will get into that.

571
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:51.000
That way, but man, gosh, that 50 cow is such a bad ass weapon.

572
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Yeah.

573
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
And then, you know, later on, we had those things mounted on our trucks

574
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.000
and the clearance of Mosul guys were stopping V-bids that are completely armored

575
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
with those things just hammered on them.

576
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
But then it's on a crow's remote system.

577
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Mm-hmm.

578
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
And that's a number.

579
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000
That's just a beautiful thing.

580
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
It's incredible that that gun was made in the early 1900s.

581
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Yeah, yeah.

582
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
For sure.

583
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Yeah, that's an incredible weapon.

584
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
You can use the exact same weapon today.

585
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000
That's amazing.

586
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
That's a feet of engineering.

587
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Someone was asking me when I posted pictures of all the brass all over the floor

588
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
of that room on Instagram.

589
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000
They're like, oh, did you have any jams?

590
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Oh, we know how to set our head space in timing.

591
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Got the gauge right there on it.

592
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Boom.

593
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
That's an awesome weapon.

594
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Now, another way, you know, we were telling me another one about getting

595
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:53.000
extracted in like a, like a, like a Russian, like hip 17.

596
00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:01.000
So, we went into this operation in Zari Panjwe, which was a really, really hot area.

597
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000
And we didn't like to drive anywhere because Afghanis stands limited, you know,

598
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
it's limited roads. And so their IED threat was huge plus the recovered

599
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:18.000
everywhere. So they would just pack all the, a culvert full of explosives and

600
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
get blow up like, you know, two, uh, M-Rapz.

601
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Okay, everybody.

602
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.000
That. And so we didn't have helicopter support for this one operation, but we were

603
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000
working with the DEA fast teams and they had their own hellow support and they had these

604
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:43.000
N-Y-7 teams, which are these, you know, Russian helicopters, which are super, durable helicopters.

605
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000
And, uh, contracted, you know, American pilots in them obviously.

606
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Okay, that's cool.

607
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
And, uh, so they had this operation and they were like, hey, you guys want to go

608
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000
on with us. So we, you know, we're, you know, we're the main force on that.

609
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
And it was during one of our turnover ops.

610
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
It was actually the op after the, uh, when Dan lost his leg, so we

611
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
as late so we did not do.

612
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
And get dropped off first thing in the morning,

613
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000
go in clear to compounds,

614
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000
and we found a whole bunch of on that.

615
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000
There were fields and fields of marijuana around here,

616
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000
and then on that operation,

617
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000
one of the compounds just had a whole bunch of hash.

618
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.000
It was like, huge burlap sacks of hash,

619
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000
and I think they said there was 200 pounds of it.

620
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
That in the middle, they destroyed it.

621
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000
And so it was the typical thing that happened.

622
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Women and children left fighters came in,

623
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
and then we were in, you know, a 360 firefight.

624
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
And we're in the firefight,

625
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
and over the radio we're hearing from our aircraft overhead,

626
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000
they're saying, hey, there's a white van,

627
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
and it's dropping fighters off around you.

628
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
So this white, this white minivan is driving off,

629
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
picking up fighters, and then driving a big circle around us

630
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
and dropping off fighters.

631
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
So this is like an hour later, fireflies.

632
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000
That thing?

633
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000
I did.

634
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000
So just like a story.

635
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
So about an hour later,

636
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000
there's, they're like, hey, the white coming over,

637
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000
because I'm on dual com.

638
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
So I can hear it on the fires net,

639
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000
and that's like the other radio frequency outside of inner squad

640
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
coms for those of you who understand that is,

641
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
it's just one where the aircraft are talking,

642
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
and one where we all talking, and I'm on both of them.

643
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
And I can hear the aircraft saying,

644
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
that white van is back.

645
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000
And so all of a sudden,

646
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000
I'm looking straight north at 200 yards,

647
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000
and I see a white van pulling to the open,

648
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
and stop in, you know, in an alleyway.

649
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
So, get on the radio.

650
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Where's that white van?

651
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
And is it directly north of our position?

652
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
And the aircraft comes back.

653
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Yeah, I just dropped off two guys,

654
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
and they're stopped. They're looking at you right now.

655
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Crack, crack, crack.

656
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000
Two rounds, and then a 60 gunner just mows the thing down,

657
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
and they're just done.

658
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Through.

659
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Well, firefight just kept going.

660
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Now, the MI-17s, they can't fly after dark.

661
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
They didn't have some kind of certification.

662
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000
So, they had to come in there and do a hot extract

663
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000
on that LZ to get us off.

664
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
So, there's bullets flying all over the place.

665
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000
We get stacked to set our breakout.

666
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
So, everyone's kind of broken down from their position.

667
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000
We slubs the security.

668
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
They're setting up the LZ.

669
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000
And then my job as the senior,

670
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
what's the gun on my aircraft,

671
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000
was I run out, I'm the first guy to the aircraft,

672
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
and I count guys getting on,

673
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000
and on the last guy on that aircraft.

674
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000
So, that aircraft isn't going until I have whatever number of people

675
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
getting on it, getting on it.

676
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Everybody's piling on there.

677
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000
I got a flag on them.

678
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000
I got a flag count, and there's no seats for me.

679
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000
So, I got a hop on the ramp,

680
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000
and hook an arm through one of the guys' legs.

681
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000
My feet are dangling off the ramp as we take off.

682
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
And then I'm shooting just half-ass from the hip

683
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000
because it's cool.

684
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Just for the call.

685
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Just for the call, the apocalypse and alcohol.

686
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000
At a place we were taking fire from as we took off.

687
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
And then we got out of there.

688
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000
It was a lot fun.

689
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000
I'm going to stop sure to say,

690
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000
and it's awesome because I'm not going to use that word anymore.

691
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000
But it was pretty dang great.

692
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Great.

693
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000
That's what we're doing.

694
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000
That's what we're doing.

695
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
It was.

696
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
And no one got hurt, no one got wounded.

697
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
No, in that one.

698
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000
No.

699
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Amazing.

700
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000
But you said, are these bullets or flying around?

701
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000
And it's just incredible because...

702
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Just the laws of chance.

703
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Yeah.

704
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Well, those aircraft too.

705
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
You know, it's like...

706
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Those old school aircraft.

707
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Like when you read about the Vietnam guys,

708
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000
and I'm reading a book right now,

709
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
those aircraft...

710
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
They were flying these...

711
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
They were...

712
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
They had Vietnamese pilots in these king-be aircrafts.

713
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000
And those things...

714
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
The guy came back from one of them.

715
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
They had 48 holes in it.

716
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
And shot 48 times.

717
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Yeah.

718
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
And this American SF guys looking at the aircraft.

719
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
And...

720
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000
He's looking at the pilot.

721
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000
He's getting in like you are.

722
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000
And he gets in.

723
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000
And he leaves looking at this Vietnamese pilot.

724
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000
And the Vietnamese pilot looks cool.

725
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
He's just like Roger.

726
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:32.000
And I got...

727
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
It's a great quote.

728
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000
The guy says something along the lines of...

729
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000
When I'm flying, I'm just thinking about flying.

730
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
I'm not thinking about bad guys.

731
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000
I'm not thinking about bullets.

732
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000
I'm just flying my aircraft.

733
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
If it's my day, it's my day.

734
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Period in the story.

735
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000
But that...

736
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Coming in a hot-extra-clank like that, that's...

737
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Getsch.

738
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000
And those guys...

739
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000
They...

740
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000
They come in super fast and superless speeds...

741
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Speeds on their side.

742
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000
And it is sketchy.

743
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000
It's...

744
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
I was in a random rush.

745
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000
And they are...

746
00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000
I have a helicopter...

747
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000
A hip...

748
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Or what are you...

749
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000
Am I 17?

750
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000
Yeah.

751
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:03.000
The...

752
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000
The NATO term is like a hip.

753
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
But yeah, it was an Africa working.

754
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000
And...

755
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000
And that's like...

756
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000
We need to get somewhere.

757
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000
And the only thing they could get us was...

758
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000
We've contracted helicopters.

759
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.000
But it was...

760
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
But it was contracted pilots too.

761
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.000
And I was happy to land on that one.

762
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Because...

763
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Those are pretty common side over there.

764
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
And they've been a stand-a-stand a lot of the other...

765
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Other agencies were using those.

766
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.000
And somebody had told me...

767
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000
And I don't know if this is true or not...

768
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000
That they were...

769
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
They were so inexpensive.

770
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
It wasn't worth doing the maintenance on them.

771
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
So when they got to a maintenance schedule,

772
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
they just destroyed it and buy another one.

773
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000
That's crazy.

774
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Yeah.

775
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000
And...

776
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000
And I don't know if that's true.

777
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000
You know, that's something I heard from some guy over at the Chow Hall...

778
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Yeah.

779
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Who was well informed apparently.

780
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000
But those pilots were so...

781
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000
So good.

782
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:02.000
And they were all probably XTF-160 guys that were now hired on by...

783
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000
These other guys that do the job over there.

784
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000
I was incredible.

785
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000
So speaking of wounded...

786
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000
Or that kid's not wounded, but you were telling me a story about...

787
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000
And I cut you off so you didn't tell it to me.

788
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.000
But you're telling me a story about a Taliban guy getting shot in the leg.

789
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Yeah.

790
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000
So last time I was telling you the story about...

791
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Last time I was telling you the story about the...

792
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.000
The operation where we'd set pop flares out...

793
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Because guys were able to get so close to us.

794
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.000
And during that firefight, one of our firing positions up on a roof...

795
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
They're like, hey, there was...

796
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
There was someone that had circled around kind of behind our position...

797
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
And we weren't taking any fire for them.

798
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
They were in... in the process of trying to flank us.

799
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000
They're like, hey, there's a guy back here and we just shot him.

800
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000
We killed him.

801
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
So stuff calmed down.

802
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
And I talked to the team commander.

803
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000
I'm like, hey, I'm gonna press out with these two guys...

804
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Because it appeared as if it was like right around the corner...

805
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Around this wall.

806
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000
And we're gonna go see if the guy's got a radio on him or anything like that.

807
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.000
So we push out of the compound and we loop around a wall...

808
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:16.000
But it's not just one wall at several walls and we get a little bit farther away.

809
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000
So we round the corner where the guy's supposed to be.

810
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
And there's no dead guy at all.

811
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:26.000
But there's a guy standing 30 yards away on a hill and he's shooting at me.

812
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:35.000
So I have got... I'm patrolling my scar heavy, but I folded the buttstock like a dummy.

813
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.000
And because I thought that was a cool way to patrol.

814
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000
And so now...

815
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000
I'm like, oh no, I can't shoulder my scar.

816
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000
So I just tried to lock it out on the ground.

817
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Like we do at the MB5Ks.

818
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Yes.

819
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.000
I lost a punch it out.

820
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.000
You just punched it out.

821
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Squeeze the atom.

822
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000
And then it had a stove pipe and a feed jam.

823
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000
So I just took a knee and started to reload and then cleared the jam real quick.

824
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Start shooting me again.

825
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000
But he was gone.

826
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:12.000
And then he turned up again when we went to do our extract.

827
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:19.000
The following day we had to clear a couple buildings near where the helos were going to land.

828
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.000
And then we found that same guy with his leg all bandaged up.

829
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
Because they didn't kill him.

830
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000
They just shot him in the way.

831
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.000
And then we just wound up, you know, leaving him there.

832
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.000
So was that the last time you patrol the New Scar heavy with the stockful?

833
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000
Yeah.

834
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:46.000
And then, you know, on another op, I learned the lesson I've never taken off my body arm and helmet because it was hot.

835
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000
Yeah.

836
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Yeah.

837
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000
What happened on that one?

838
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
Oh my goodness.

839
00:53:51.000 --> 00:54:02.000
So we were, um, it was an operation swally caught where we'd taken high ground above a couple of compounds that we'd cleared.

840
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:13.000
And the next day, the talent, we'd gotten to the point right where we'd started to get a little bit complacent.

841
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000
And all our engagements with the Taliban, we'd always had the upper hand against them.

842
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.000
We'd, uh, completely, we had air power.

843
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000
We had better weapons.

844
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000
We were trained better.

845
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000
Yeah.

846
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.000
And on this operation, we had a piece of high ground right behind the compounds that we took.

847
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.000
What was everyone wearing was everyone using the eight cogs on their, on their scarves generally or what were they using?

848
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Guys, variety of a cogs, the snipers actually took the scopes off their SR25s and put them on the, uh, the scopes.

849
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.000
So everyone had basically everyone had scopes and so lots of them.

850
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000
And we had 300 windmacks and I brought it along on this.

851
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:59.000
I'm just thinking mentally from the viewpoint of where the enemies at, like you're reaching out and touching them accurately way further than they can get you pretty much.

852
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Which, which again, leans towards you thinking to yourself, we're going to kick these guys ass every time.

853
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Yep.

854
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000
And then you did kick the ass a bunch of times.

855
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.000
And, and so then these guys start to take a high ground all around our positions.

856
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:19.000
And we can see a guy pushing out with a pkm onto this flat ledgerock.

857
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000
He's 1100 yards away.

858
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000
And we're shooting at him with a 300 windmack.

859
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000
What it's windy.

860
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:32.000
And we're missing, we're missing close and he'd go back and then come back out, go back, come back out.

861
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000
And they were getting set up all around us and then they just brought it.

862
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:45.000
They let us go with a salvo of rocket propelled grenade grenades and then just steady pkm fire.

863
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000
And we thought there are 1,000 yards out.

864
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
They really can't do that much.

865
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Oh, it's, you know 105 degrees out.

866
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000
So we'll take our body armor and helmets off.

867
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000
And then that did just laid the hammer down.

868
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Luckily for me, I happened to be right on top of my body armor.

869
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
And because I was in the, in the prone position.

870
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.000
And then I just was able to snake into my body armor and get my helmet back on my head.

871
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:17.000
And, you know, in this, this is a position where this is the first time we'd been somewhere.

872
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
We couldn't fill sandbags.

873
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
So we just stacked a bunch of rocks.

874
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000
It, as best we could to make a fighting position.

875
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000
And the bullets were just steadily hammering the rocks and hammering the rocks and hammering the rocks.

876
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000
And I was thinking, man alive.

877
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
I'm, I'm going to get shot.

878
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.000
And I'm, I wonder if it's going to hurt, but it's definitely going to happen.

879
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000
The odds are, odds are there.

880
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000
And somehow I didn't.

881
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:47.000
And then then the B, up B1 bomber came on station and dropped a whole bunch of ordinance and laid the hammer down.

882
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000
But after that.

883
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
And I ran out of water.

884
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000
We all ran out of water up in this underground position.

885
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000
It was like 112, 14 degrees at 2 in the afternoon.

886
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:04.000
We ran underwater and there was no getting any water until that night when the sun went down.

887
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Did you listen to podcast with Ron Shuron?

888
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.000
I'm sure I did it.

889
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000
Yeah, the SF guy, Medal of Honor recipient.

890
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000
But if you go watch the videos.

891
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Oh, that, yeah.

892
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Yeah, that, like, the castle that they're attacking.

893
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000
That's crazy.

894
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000
It's just straight uphill.

895
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:24.000
I was just, I couldn't believe that.

896
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.000
When I, as I was reading, like, I was reading a bunch of articles about the situation.

897
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Yeah.

898
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.000
And then they kept talking about video and I said,

899
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000
I'll check out YouTube.

900
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
And I saw it back.

901
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000
I couldn't believe it.

902
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
I couldn't believe it.

903
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000
And the way he described it, it was just incredible.

904
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Yeah.

905
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.000
He just laid it out there.

906
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000
He's like, oh, yeah.

907
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Yeah.

908
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
He's so understated.

909
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
He's like, well, you know, it was a little bit of a hill.

910
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.000
Yeah.

911
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000
He's a pretty big building.

912
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000
I was like, oh, it was a cliff.

913
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
And it was a castle of talking to the cliff.

914
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Oh, well, it was a pretty good awesome guy.

915
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
You know, another thing that we were talking about.

916
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000
And you made, obviously, this is a good,

917
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.000
leave an Afghanistan.

918
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.000
But it's getting back early in your career when you were,

919
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.000
when you failed the stalking section of Sniperschool.

920
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.000
And then you went back and you, and you, you know,

921
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000
you obviously made it through you past the stalking section.

922
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
And you kind of touched on it when you were on last night.

923
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:25.000
But I was wondering, like, a little bit more granularity on what you changed

924
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000
that you went from failing the stalks to, all right,

925
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000
here's me knocking out whatever it is.

926
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000
Yeah.

927
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.000
And it comes down to basically doing what I've been taught.

928
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.000
And, and, and, and people were telling me is that

929
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000
you start the stalk.

930
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000
You're told to find the OP, which is, you know,

931
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000
1200 yards away.

932
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.000
And the first thing you've got to do is figure out where that OP,

933
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000
an OP is an observation point.

934
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.000
And that's where the guys that are grading you on the stalk

935
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000
who are other Sniper instructors, that's where they're at.

936
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000
And you, you take that, this model.

937
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000
And I always just thinking how it applies to problem solving

938
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.000
basically across the board, where,

939
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.000
okay, I need to find a goal in my future here somewhere.

940
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000
In this case, it's the stalk.

941
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:25.000
And then, before I start executing on moving toward that,

942
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
that goal, going to find that OP,

943
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:32.000
I need to take some time and study the terrain and see what my,

944
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000
you know, line of attack is going to be and how I'm going to move

945
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000
all the way up to where I'm going to go.

946
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000
And then I need to put it into action.

947
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:46.000
And while I'm putting an action, I'm constantly reassessing that goal

948
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000
and adjusting my actions across the way.

949
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000
And that, when I went from that model,

950
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.000
I went from, you know, failing stalks to being the first one done,

951
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
hardly spending any time on my belly and doing that.

952
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:06.000
So, then you take that and you apply it to life.

953
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
And you think about just goal setting, where do I want to be in five,

954
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
in five years?

955
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And identify it and then say, okay, do a little research.

956
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
How do I get there?

957
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
And then get on that damn path, stay disciplined,

958
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
and then just keep the eye on the target and keep adjusting your aim as you go.

959
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And I can look back at times in my life where,

960
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
really, I wasn't paying attention.

961
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I'm really just treading water, you know,

962
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
living paycheck to paycheck, doing whatever.

963
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000
And now, you know, I take that model and I apply it to,

964
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
where do I want to be in five years?

965
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Where do I want my kids to be?

966
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
What kind of parent do I want to be?

967
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
And how am I going to get there?

968
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
And what's the path I'm going to lay out for it?

969
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Yeah, and it's from a leadership perspective, obviously, this applies.

970
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Because from a leadership perspective,

971
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
if you, and I was just on Peter T as podcast,

972
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
and we were talking about a little bit about that.

973
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Strategic framework tactical, right?

974
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Yeah, and you have to stand in it.

975
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
And, you know, what I've said to him,

976
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
where it first started to occur to me,

977
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:19.000
that was, hey, if my guys don't know what it is that we're trying to accomplish,

978
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
they can't make it.

979
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
They can't, they can't move.

980
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Sure, I can tell move eight yards forward,

981
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
and then they can't hear me anymore.

982
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Now, what they're going to wait for me to get whatever they are.

983
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I can say, go take that building right there.

984
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Well, now they can't hear me anymore.

985
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
So now what they're going to do?

986
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
They're going to sit there and wait for me to come up and tell them,

987
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
do something else?

988
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
No, they need to know what we're trying to get accomplished.

989
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
And then they need to have this standard operating procedure

990
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
down well enough so they can, and the parameters that they're allowed

991
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
to maneuver within, and that allows us to actually accomplish the mission.

992
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
And that's something, I think I, I mean, I don't even know

993
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
when I learn that, but without that strategic objective,

994
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
and that's a strong word, okay?

995
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I get strategic, I get what it means,

996
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
and I'm not talking about, you know, global warfare,

997
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
but when you're in a town,

998
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
and you have a mission objective that, okay,

999
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
we're going to get to this building, or we're going to move to this area,

1000
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
we're going to take this piece of terrain, and everybody knows that.

1001
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
And even when those things change, because as you know,

1002
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
you get into a contact or you get into a situation where you change

1003
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
what you're doing, you have to let everyone know that,

1004
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
hey, we're breaking contact, we're getting out of here,

1005
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
hey, we're going to strongpoint this building or whatever.

1006
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Once everybody knows that, then they can act on it,

1007
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
then they can carry it out, same thing that,

1008
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
well, what you're talking about there, now I want a bigger picture,

1009
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
of course, until it applies on a bigger picture,

1010
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
if your troops in the field don't know what it is you're trying to achieve,

1011
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
then they make bad decisions.

1012
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
If they don't know that you're trying to protect the populace,

1013
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
if they don't know that that's the broad strategy,

1014
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
then they get out there and treat the populace, they lack like idiots.

1015
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
If they know that's what they're trying to do, then they make better decisions,

1016
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
because they don't, but they'll make better decisions,

1017
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
because they understand what that broad strategy is,

1018
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
and it's certainly the same thing in business,

1019
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
and with business it goes back and forth too,

1020
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
because business, sometimes in business,

1021
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
you're, you know, I run into it with businesses where they're,

1022
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
for instance, trying to go public,

1023
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
so they need to make money every quarter,

1024
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
they need to show that profitability increase,

1025
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
and so the biggest thing they got on their mind

1026
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
is trying to show a good quarter,

1027
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
and they'll sacrifice some strategic things like,

1028
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
the sacrifice a little bit of taking care of their customer,

1029
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000
because they want to scrape a little money out of it out of the situation,

1030
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000
that's a bad strategic play, but they do it short-term at the time,

1031
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
because they know they gotta make money the quarters,

1032
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
they can come back and read less more.

1033
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
So, but everybody's gotta know that,

1034
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
because if everyone thinks, hey,

1035
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
hey, the number one thing is we never let our customers out,

1036
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
okay, guess what, we lost money this quarter,

1037
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
now we can't go public, because we,

1038
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
and again, this is a really kind of garden level examples,

1039
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
but that's the kind of thing where what you're talking about

1040
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000
if people don't understand what that longer term goal is,

1041
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
then they can't really operate and function on their own,

1042
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
which is a problem.

1043
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
No, and you're not thinking long-term,

1044
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
you're just thinking day to day, basically.

1045
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Yeah, I kind of went off at the master on that one kid

1046
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000
that asked me, how often are you thinking strategically

1047
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
and how often are you thinking tactically?

1048
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
And, you know, I just kind of was going off about,

1049
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
look man, every single thing I do is strategic.

1050
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I'm making any tactical moves.

1051
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I'm not worried about the tactical wins and losses.

1052
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Now, there's a reason for that.

1053
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I'm going to good spot right now where a little tactical loss

1054
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
doesn't mean that much to me right now,

1055
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
and it's really easy for me to just focus on the strategic stuff.

1056
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
You know, when I was younger, I had to focus more on some tactical things,

1057
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
you know, that's the way it is.

1058
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
But even as a young person, you gotta keep that strict.

1059
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
You know, you might have to take some tactical,

1060
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
you might have to make some adjustments and win some short-term battles,

1061
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
just because that's the way it is,

1062
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
you should be thinking tactics all the time.

1063
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Or, start you should be thinking strategy all the time.

1064
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
You should be thinking long game all the time.

1065
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
All the time thinking about the long game.

1066
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
All the time thinking about how is this decision affect

1067
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
where I'm going to be in the long-term,

1068
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
because the short-term decisions,

1069
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
those are the ones that beat you down.

1070
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Yeah, absolutely not.

1071
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
I'm not going to be that long-day.

1072
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Nested inside that long-term strategy.

1073
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Yeah.

1074
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Yeah. I actually kind of appreciated that he brought that up.

1075
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Yeah, he was a good question.

1076
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
He was a younger guy.

1077
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
And you could see he's thinking, you know,

1078
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
he probably thought to himself,

1079
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000
hey, it seems like Jockel keeps talking about the long game.

1080
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
And he thought to himself how often is Jockel thinking about that?

1081
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
And so he asked the question, good on him.

1082
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
So I could explain, I'm thinking about it all the time.

1083
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
I'm thinking about all the time.

1084
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
That's the way you gotta do it.

1085
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
And Peter and Tia as well,

1086
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
for bringing that,

1087
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
the whole framework,

1088
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
the bring and the whole framework and everything up.

1089
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for that aspect of that.

1090
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Yeah, because I was listening to that in this morning.

1091
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
I'm like, yeah, this lays.

1092
01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000
That's the same thing that makes you successful on a stock,

1093
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
choosing that goal and then working your way to it,

1094
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
doing your, you know,

1095
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
and you gotta watch out for the situation

1096
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
where you get paralysis by analysis or

1097
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000
and that's caught up by that you got a time limit on a stock.

1098
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Okay, you got three hours to get this done.

1099
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
So you gotta get it figured out and you gotta get moving.

1100
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Or I think a lot of people will fall into that trap

1101
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
where the due to much study,

1102
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
too much study.

1103
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1104
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
And then there are no actual life in life in general.

1105
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
And in stocks, guys,

1106
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
will run out of time.

1107
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I said something the other day.

1108
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Most things don't get finished because most things don't get started.

1109
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I think people even even start building,

1110
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
make that move.

1111
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Right.

1112
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Of course, hey, guess what,

1113
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
big chocolate is an dichotomy.

1114
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
And that's the bottom line.

1115
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
If you rush into it and you start moving without having

1116
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
a long-term plan, you're probably going to make it a bad move.

1117
01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
If you take too long, you're going to wait too long

1118
01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
and the whole room is going to pass you by.

1119
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Yep.

1120
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
So you have to constantly modulate and figure out where you're at.

1121
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
And no one's going to be able to give you the answer.

1122
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I can't sit here and be like,

1123
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
oh, you know what you're going to do right there?

1124
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
You want to make this, no.

1125
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
No one's going to be sitting there telling you that day by day.

1126
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
You've got to figure that out.

1127
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
And you've got to figure out if it's really,

1128
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
really moving you in the right direction.

1129
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Yep.

1130
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Wait, it's got to be.

1131
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
When you were talking about coming back to trade at,

1132
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
and you know, you and I both had the,

1133
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000
the luck to be at trade at in the positions we were in.

1134
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I was the, I was the trade at OIC.

1135
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
You were the trade at CMC.

1136
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
So basically we were the senior dudes.

1137
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
We weren't together unfortunately.

1138
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
But what a good job.

1139
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And what a good opportunity to see how things unfold.

1140
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000
And what a good opportunity to take these standard operating procedures

1141
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
and pressure test them.

1142
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
You exactly.

1143
01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:00.000
So I was, I was hit up the other day in a brief where I was talking about,

1144
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
when I was there as a true PSEA,

1145
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
and we did our first FTX,

1146
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000
and you had just trained, changed training to where we,

1147
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
but prior to that, and every time I'd been through Land Warfare,

1148
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
prior to coming through as, as the troops senior and listed advisor in 2008,

1149
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
our FTX is where all live fire.

1150
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Great.

1151
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Live fire school, but it's so canned.

1152
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Yep.

1153
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Because it has to be for safety,

1154
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000
that it really doesn't put any pressure on the leadership,

1155
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
and there's not really any pressure,

1156
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
brought to bear on any of your SOPs.

1157
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Yeah.

1158
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Simply, everyone, when you're in a gunfight,

1159
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
there's two horrible things that the enemy will do.

1160
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
They will shoot at you, and they will maneuver.

1161
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
And when you're using live fire for training,

1162
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
your enemy is a bunch of paper targets.

1163
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000
At best, they're mounted on those little cards that can move around,

1164
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
but they're very, very limited, not even remotely close to what a human being is going to do.

1165
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
So when you're going with live fire,

1166
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
your enemy neither shoots back at you,

1167
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
nor do they maneuver.

1168
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
So in the sealed teams, we would destroy our paper targets all the time.

1169
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
We would crush them all the time, relentlessly.

1170
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
We would outmaneuver them because they couldn't move.

1171
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
We would outshute them because they didn't shoot.

1172
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
So it was pretty easy to dominate.

1173
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
And sure, there was that level of stress of the fact that it is live fire.

1174
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
And when you're out like in the desert,

1175
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
you are, and you do do, and we still do this,

1176
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
where you have to shift fire, and you're walking,

1177
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
and you're making sure that you're safe,

1178
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
because you can't, you can you can shoot each other.

1179
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
But that type of stress compared to the stress of,

1180
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000
okay, now the enemy, we're using laser tag guns or paintball,

1181
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
and the enemy isn't full on maneuvering.

1182
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
They're full on shooting back at us.

1183
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
That's a big step up.

1184
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Yeah, and so we just completely,

1185
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
epically failed that first operation.

1186
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
And we took the hard look at the four biggest things we did wrong

1187
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000
and identified where our standard operating procedures were flawed.

1188
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.000
And then we sat down with our leadership,

1189
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:16.000
and we got input and started to modify those SOPs.

1190
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
So we could build up standard operating procedures

1191
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
that were resilient enough to withstand all the pressure

1192
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
that you guys were putting on us in training.

1193
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
And someone asked me, at us,

1194
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.000
a keynote I was given the other day,

1195
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
like, well, didn't you guys have SOPs prior to that?

1196
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000
And we absolutely did, but they weren't good enough

1197
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
because they couldn't withstand the pressure.

1198
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
So they had to be modified.

1199
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
We had to modify the way we were doing SOPs

1200
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
for getting ahead counts.

1201
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
We had to modify how we were dealing with our downmen.

1202
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Like, honestly, we weren't carrying letters around.

1203
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
We weren't, but it's just an absolute abject disaster.

1204
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
If you get a wounded guy sure,

1205
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I can drag him off the X.

1206
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000
But now if I patch him up and I got to throw him over my shoulder again,

1207
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I'm going to blow out every bandage I just put on him.

1208
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
That's stupid.

1209
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000
You know, our radio comms going when everything is confusing.

1210
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
We had to fix that.

1211
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
So we had to dial those SOPs in.

1212
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
The standard operating procedures.

1213
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:30.000
And the beauty of trade-at is that as stuff is happening on the battlefield,

1214
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
we immediately modify that in the training.

1215
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
And we're putting that on top of the guys in training.

1216
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000
So they can see if they're standard operating procedures are good to go

1217
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
or if they're flawed and they need to be modified.

1218
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
So we can constantly modify if people are honest about them.

1219
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Yeah.

1220
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And that's the beauty of the, the basically, the Petri dish or the lab that we had

1221
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:57.000
out there at trade-at because the other thing is we could see when when people were being honest

1222
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:05.000
about their mistakes or when guys were were blame-casting and not taking ownership of what was going on

1223
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
and not being honest with their SOPs.

1224
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
And then you just develop these SOPs.

1225
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Like they don't just apply to the battlefield.

1226
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.000
We came up with standard operating procedures for, you know, how we did our admin stuff,

1227
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000
how we dealt with with anything that you can think of.

1228
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000
We would think of a good way to do it and then test it and then run through it.

1229
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:39.000
So, you know, you might not like this, this analogy, but I think that SOPs kind of are a life hack

1230
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.000
because is one of those things that you can lay there is no work.

1231
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:49.000
I know, except for the standard operating procedure is pretty dang close to one.

1232
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Yeah, you know what's, as you were talking about that, one thing that I definitely noticed is

1233
01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:02.000
the, you could have almost 90% of the time that you used the word modify our SOP.

1234
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:11.000
You could have used the word simplify because most of the time it was someone saying, hey, we got this crazy.

1235
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
This is what we're going to do. We're going to do this and you're going to do that and it is all these crazy things.

1236
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
And they realize that doesn't work. So you make it simpler and simpler.

1237
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Now, where that's counterintuitive is like in extreme ownership where I talked about doing SSC.

1238
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
And when we first started doing SSC, the plan was real simple.

1239
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Just smash everything and just take whatever you'd find, right?

1240
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
That was a horrible plan and it didn't work.

1241
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.000
So we had to, we had to put something that was a little bit more looked on the surface to be a little bit more complex.

1242
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Even though when you broke down the individual human beings and what they were doing, it was a very straightforward and very simple.

1243
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:50.000
So, so yeah, yeah, I know there's no doubt that having that opportunity to watch SOPs get tested and either pass or fail.

1244
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:58.000
And it was still obvious either away because it was so cool when the platoon and the taskings would start to work together.

1245
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000
And they'd start to cover move for each other and they'd start to use decentralized command.

1246
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
They would crush the trade act guys.

1247
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Or they would at least get the best of them.

1248
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000
They'd at least kill them all.

1249
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Whereas when they're not doing it, it would be comical.

1250
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Four trade act guys would kill 40 guys or whatever it was.

1251
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Then you'd just be thinking, hmm.

1252
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
And you're right, this is where you'd have ego problems would show up.

1253
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Because guys would think, and it was so hard from my perspective when you're like, listen.

1254
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:37.000
The trade act cadre is going to do the same thing to the last nine troops or the last five troops.

1255
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
They did this exact same scenario.

1256
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.000
And the other troops used simple standard operating procedures.

1257
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
They covered a move.

1258
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
They used decentralized command and they won.

1259
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Here's what you're doing.

1260
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
This is from my perspective and I know it's hard.

1261
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:56.000
But what you're doing is you're trying to control everyone or what you're doing is you've got these standard operating procedures that are too complicated.

1262
01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.000
You're not prioritizing an X-Cuner. You're just, you've got to follow these simple rules.

1263
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:08.000
And it would be hard to convey to some guys if the guys wanted to put up their ego barrier and let it offend them and think,

1264
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000
No, never happen or no, that's just the trade act guys knew what we were going to do.

1265
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Yeah, the trade act guys know what you're going to do.

1266
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
You know what? You're attacking a target area.

1267
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Anyone any, any military mind in the world is going to get the high ground.

1268
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
And then they're going to sweep through if they can from high ground to low ground.

1269
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
That's what everyone's going to do.

1270
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
It's not like the trade act guys, the anybody could figure that out.

1271
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Any, any military mind is going to look at a target and do it one of three ways or one of four ways.

1272
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000
And 50% of those four ways actually is going to overlap.

1273
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:48.000
So you don't have to be a frequent rocket science or a scientist or or or or or Napoleon to be able to figure out,

1274
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Okay, here's the target.

1275
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Where do I think the seals are going to come in from?

1276
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
It's like, oh, okay, they're probably going to come in from here.

1277
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
I'll set up two guys there.

1278
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
There's also a chance they're going to come in from over here.

1279
01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Go, I'll put two guys over there.

1280
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
There you go.

1281
01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
We knew you knew our plan.

1282
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
It's like, yeah, bro.

1283
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.000
The enemy is, it's like you talked about you had situations where you went in and you're like,

1284
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Oh, we'll go get on the high ground.

1285
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Oh, the, the enemy put IED's there.

1286
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Yeah, guess what?

1287
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
It doesn't take a rocket science to figure out.

1288
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Oh, if you're going to assault us here,

1289
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
you're probably going to want to get this piece of this piece of terrain over here.

1290
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.000
So that would offend guys and they'd get into the, hey, this is this is wrong.

1291
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
And instead of saying, okay, what did I do wrong?

1292
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Can you just, can you just tell me what I did wrong again?

1293
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Because I need, I'm not sure I understand it.

1294
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Oh, well, what you did is this.

1295
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
You didn't prioritize next to you.

1296
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
You didn't use decentralized command.

1297
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
And they would just, if you're not going to listen to that,

1298
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
you know, it's a problem.

1299
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
I had a guy at the master just asking me about like,

1300
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.000
how do you handle it when someone really picks you apart

1301
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
on a debrief?

1302
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
And I flag, bro.

1303
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000
And I, and that, I, what I do is I look them rightly,

1304
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000
and I say, thank you.

1305
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Thank you for telling me that, please, thank you.

1306
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
And, and I appreciate it.

1307
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
And I'm going to go look at what you just told me.

1308
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
And I'm going to try and figure out if I can fix it.

1309
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Because otherwise, like you, you just, I could see in this guy's eyes.

1310
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Like he's asking me that question because his ego is getting offended.

1311
01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
I, and everyone's ego gets offended.

1312
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Mine gets offended when somebody tells me that.

1313
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
When somebody gives me the nine big debrief points on what I did wrong,

1314
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000
I'm freaking mad.

1315
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I don't want to make mistakes.

1316
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
I even ego just like everyone else.

1317
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
If not a freaking larger ego than anyone else.

1318
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
And when somebody tells me I did nine things wrong,

1319
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
I'm pissed, I'm pissed at myself.

1320
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000
And it's really easy for me to look at you and get pissed to you

1321
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
for telling me that I screwed this up.

1322
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000
But instead, I've gotten old enough to realize,

1323
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
even if I don't like you, it's even harder if I don't like you.

1324
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
It's even harder.

1325
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
When I don't like you, it's even harder, right?

1326
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
That's what makes it super hard.

1327
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
But when you go, you know what?

1328
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
You bite down and you go, okay, thank you.

1329
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Let me assess what you just told me.

1330
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
If you could make that little step up in your life,

1331
01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000
it's epic.

1332
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
And when guys want to your point,

1333
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
when guys wouldn't make that step in that step up

1334
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
in coming through the trade at training,

1335
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
it would be a nightmare.

1336
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
It was a nightmare.

1337
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000
And the thing is man, like, I love all these team guys.

1338
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
I want them to go kick ass.

1339
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
That's all I wanted was to go do great things on the planet.

1340
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
And when you get that, the guy coming through

1341
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
that just would be offended by it.

1342
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
And I'd be so bummed out.

1343
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
I'd be so bummed out.

1344
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
I'd be like, bro, I'd just want you to do good.

1345
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
I'm just telling you, like, don't focus on a head count

1346
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000
when you're in the firefight.

1347
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
That's what I'm saying.

1348
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Yeah.

1349
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
And then you get to the point where

1350
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:45.000
you're just like, oh man, you're not going to get it.

1351
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Now I'm just going to make you suffer.

1352
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Yeah.

1353
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:56.000
But because you'll get critique points where guys will say,

1354
01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000
hey, we need to get an op so we can go start to finish

1355
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.000
where you let us win basically.

1356
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000
And you know, if you're playing football

1357
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
and your college team goes against a high school team,

1358
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
that's not challenging for anybody,

1359
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
and you're not going to really learn anything out of it.

1360
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000
And that's why I gave you a walk through.

1361
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
And so after seeing that so many times and running land

1362
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.000
warfare, I started going out at the front day one

1363
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.000
and saying, hey, guys, listen, you're going to get a walk through.

1364
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
That's your time to work through your whole script

1365
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
on how you're going to run a target assault.

1366
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000
But I'm short-changing you if I'm not putting pressure on you

1367
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
when we have these FTX nights because we only have this place for a limit

1368
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000
period of time and this is where you're going to find where your weak points are

1369
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000
and get better.

1370
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000
And then knowing about myself when I have those two voices,

1371
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
arguing in my head, the one that's my ego

1372
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000
and it's making an excuse for everything that someone is who's debriefing me

1373
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
is picking apart and the other reasonable voice,

1374
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000
which I'm trying to turn the volume up on,

1375
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000
that's going, oh yeah, that's a fair critique.

1376
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Yeah, well, I got a little lazy there, shouldn't have taken my body

1377
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:18.000
armor off of that kind of stuff or the worst was like the OIC

1378
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
that would come out after you were OIC.

1379
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000
If he came out to training and he would find some stuff that was screwed up

1380
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
and he's like, why am I the one fixing it?

1381
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
And I'm like, you are exactly right.

1382
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
And guys are good angry, he's like, you come out here and you call this out.

1383
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
He goes, we deserve it.

1384
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Let's not do this ever again.

1385
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.000
We cannot have our boss coming out here and looking at how we're running training

1386
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
and calling us out.

1387
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.000
And a lot of it was, for an, I'll give you an example.

1388
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Go onto an IAD's range and a platoon is decided to have their 60 gunner

1389
01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.000
walk point because that's going to work good for an immediate action drill.

1390
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
But that's not what you're really going to do.

1391
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000
That's patrol to contact.

1392
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
That's not what we're training in an immediate action drill.

1393
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
We're training for a sucker punch.

1394
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000
And he's like, what and the why we're the sports is going on here.

1395
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:18.000
And we'd be like, yeah, but guys wouldn't want to tell the platoon

1396
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.000
be one of these small things where, and, and, and, and I failed in this

1397
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000
and in, and leadership a lot of times where it just like, I'll just let that slide.

1398
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000
I'll just let that pretty soon everything sliding and you're not really given people any guidance.

1399
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.000
But, um, yeah, people come out.

1400
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000
You got to be honest with the critique and look at it and then move forward.

1401
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000
And at the end of the day, you always kind of know when you're wrong and it,

1402
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:50.000
to take ownership of it, you feel better about it because now you have power over it.

1403
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Right?

1404
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.000
And then it's like, oh, if I think that the, the trade-out staff,

1405
01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:02.000
is cheating, non-powerless against it and it's just kind of a stress that I'm going to deal.

1406
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Exactly.

1407
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
They're just going to win.

1408
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
It doesn't matter blah blah.

1409
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000
And then it's, it's also on on a trade-out.

1410
01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.000
It's, and it's difficult to, to debrief people and not come off as condescending.

1411
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
That's a real skill.

1412
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And that's the sum guys are really good at that.

1413
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
And that's something I try to work on.

1414
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
And I, I'm not perfect at it, but this is,

1415
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000
it gives people constructive criticism in a manner that they're accepted to.

1416
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Yeah, I wasn't.

1417
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:34.000
One of the things I'm talking about that, and trade-out is you don't really have a good relationship with 50% of the guys that come

1418
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
to come through.

1419
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
So some guys that come through, like when you're coming through in like,

1420
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Hey, bro, like, we, I could do this like, be pretty straight up with you.

1421
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Yeah.

1422
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Some guys that don't really know you and you're from like a different team and I never worked with you before.

1423
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
So I have no sort of sort of relationship.

1424
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
And then it's a harder, you know, to say, hey man, that was a really bad job.

1425
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
You know, now I, I don't know.

1426
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.000
What I, what I ended up doing to trade-out was I would just be like, hey, this is what happened.

1427
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000
You know, and by the way, I recorded you on my audio thing.

1428
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Like I would carry a little voice recorder.

1429
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And then when people would be panicking or freaking out, I would record them.

1430
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
And I'd say you were kind of freaking out out there.

1431
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
And they'd say, I was freaking out.

1432
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Okay, listen to this.

1433
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Everybody, everybody, they'd say,

1434
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
They're like, is that sound like freaking out to you?

1435
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Is that your calm voice?

1436
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:23.000
So the, and the other fun thing about the Dits gear was,

1437
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000
you could hit them with the near miss because if they got killed,

1438
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
they would get now drug through the desert by their ankle.

1439
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Yeah.

1440
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000
And guys didn't want to die.

1441
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
So they still weren't as honest about fires.

1442
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
They could be, but they would still like,

1443
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000
my favorite thing to do would be put the God gun,

1444
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.000
which is just a regular thing I had as a lane grader on near miss.

1445
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
And if guys were screwing around,

1446
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
like they would not, you know, they'd all be standing up in a perimeter

1447
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
where they shouldn't be standing,

1448
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
and I would just near miss them all.

1449
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Guys would just die.

1450
01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Yeah.

1451
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000
They live in a real house.

1452
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
They was like legitimate real rounds are covered out of where they'd hear that near miss

1453
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
because they didn't want to get drug through the desert for freaking two

1454
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
kilometers to the extract point.

1455
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Have all their gear beat up and bruised.

1456
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Come on.

1457
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Punished all their whoever has to carry use is getting completely punished.

1458
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Okay, I feel my foesman.

1459
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
I feel my foes.

1460
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Yeah.

1461
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Well, I would then younger guys coming out.

1462
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
You know, everyone talks about the big,

1463
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000
malignal rules.

1464
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.000
And I'm, I'm, I'm, from what I've seen when I, when I've talked to teams,

1465
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.000
and when I've gone out to some training sites, guys are awesome.

1466
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
I think across the board they are.

1467
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Yeah.

1468
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
I mean, I've looked at all the new guys.

1469
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:46.000
And the quality of the new guys now compared to who I was.

1470
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Yeah.

1471
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
I'm not sure I could have made it through Katrina.

1472
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000
If I was compared against all the guys now, they're smart.

1473
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
They're motivated and they're hard.

1474
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Yeah.

1475
01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000
And they're only coming in because they want to go to war.

1476
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Yeah.

1477
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Because that's a given.

1478
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Yeah.

1479
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Did I want to go to war?

1480
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Absolutely.

1481
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000
But it wasn't a known thing.

1482
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
I got to admit that I kind of thought it was.

1483
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I thought like a, I'm going to nom.

1484
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Yeah.

1485
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000
I think I'm going to nom in 1991.

1486
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Yeah.

1487
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
But yeah, these guys know for a fact.

1488
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.000
I mean, they, they, they see, they see, you know, memorial services on TV.

1489
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
They know what's what they're getting into for sure.

1490
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:31.000
And the complaints, the complaints about the Millennials that I hear are that,

1491
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000
oh, they want to know why they're doing something.

1492
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Well, duh.

1493
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Yeah.

1494
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
You know, and you just covered that in that document that was written after

1495
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
a war two that says, hey, guess what?

1496
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:47.000
You need to tell guys why they're doing something or they're not going to be the most effective.

1497
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.000
And it's, it's generationally, generationally, it's just more blame casting

1498
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
or people are blinding about the next generation.

1499
01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Yeah.

1500
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000
It goes back forever.

1501
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
That's just normal, right?

1502
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000
I think it's one of those normal whiny things that you got to be.

1503
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
You know, the young guys suck.

1504
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Uh-huh.

1505
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Little, you suck.

1506
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:15.000
When I was at one of the, the leadership courses with some regular Navy leadership

1507
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:21.000
and one of the master chiefs was telling a story that she had an E5,

1508
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000
that she worked in, in supply.

1509
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
And she's like, hey, I need you to go do the inventory today.

1510
01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:34.000
And she's checks back, comes back like an hour and a half later.

1511
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.000
And uh, the guy had to go inventory this whole warehouse.

1512
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
And he's hanging out in the coffee lounge and I don't have later.

1513
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
And she's like, hey, what the heck is going on here?

1514
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
She's like, I did the inventory.

1515
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
And she's like, no way.

1516
01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000
That takes all day.

1517
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Let's spot check it.

1518
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Spotchit is randomly pulls up a couple items off that inventory list.

1519
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Checks it.

1520
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
She's like, how did you do this?

1521
01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:02.000
And he's like, well, you know, I got this app reader on my phone.

1522
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:08.000
And I just went and scanned all the bar codes used his phone and completed the inventory,

1523
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000
like that with a little bit of ingenuity.

1524
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000
And so basically she just told them the end state and got out of his way.

1525
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.000
It was by accident, but she got out of his way and let him figure out how something to do it.

1526
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000
And then then went with it.

1527
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Nothing wrong with that.

1528
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000
No.

1529
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000
What about you for you as you've gotten older?

1530
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.000
What kind of mindset changes have you gone through?

1531
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Where?

1532
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Like, I just kind of talked about one from my perspective as I got older.

1533
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Let's see, see different things.

1534
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.000
And I always try and make that perfectly clear to everyone that you know, I kind of,

1535
01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000
you know, I learned.

1536
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
I learned and I'm still learning.

1537
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:59.000
And so, you know, would you, what, what, what, like, were some things that if you

1538
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.000
could have learned or changed your mentality on earlier?

1539
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Like what?

1540
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Yeah, I mean, shutting down the ego.

1541
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:17.000
You know, a lot of my growth honestly is being married to Iris and is a hundred percent responsible for her.

1542
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
And it just shuts down here ego.

1543
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Shots my ego down, but then has honest conversations about, well, what are you really thinking here?

1544
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:35.000
And then, you know, actually listening to what someone saying because the, the trap I used to fall into was when someone was talking to me,

1545
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
I wasn't really listening to them.

1546
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
I was just formulating what I was going to say back to them.

1547
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Formulating your counter punch.

1548
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Exactly.

1549
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And I probably score a high and trait disagreeableness.

1550
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Yeah.

1551
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:57.000
So, you know, it's just my nature to want to be at that point of friction, but that also makes me just,

1552
01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:02.000
you know, want to go stick my finger in people's eyes and offend them and stuff like that.

1553
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:10.000
And so, stepping back and opening my mind up to other points of view.

1554
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:17.000
And then being a little bit more cognizant of other people and how they're reacting to me.

1555
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000
So, I kind of just Hawaiian or act with them relationship wise.

1556
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:26.000
I don't know if you remember this question at the Master Guide asked, hey, what, what do you do when you,

1557
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:34.000
how do you deal with someone who's super negative and about, you know, the, the, the team or whatever.

1558
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:39.000
And, you know, I said, here's a really good leadership technique that you can use.

1559
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000
It's very complicated.

1560
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
It's called Listen.

1561
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000
How much you listen to them?

1562
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000
But you actually listen to what people are saying, somebody feels really negative about my team.

1563
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Guess what?

1564
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
I want to know why.

1565
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000
I want to actually hear their explanation as to why they're being super negative.

1566
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:57.000
And by the way, when you allow someone to voice their opinion and you listen to them,

1567
01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000
carefully instead of formulating a counter punch, which is what our instinct is to do.

1568
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.000
If instead of you, hmm, okay, what's wrong Jason, what's, what's the problem over here?

1569
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I actually want to listen to you.

1570
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
I want to hear what you have to say.

1571
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:17.000
And that is such an advantage as a leader instead of always feeling like, hey, anybody that steps to me is getting crushed.

1572
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Look, no, actually, anyway, it steps to me is going to teach me something.

1573
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
And I'm happy to hear it.

1574
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Yeah, boom.

1575
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:32.000
And then just being aware of, you know, my biases.

1576
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:39.000
And then I find this a lot of times with the dang media presses the heck out of my buttons.

1577
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:47.000
And so I got to the point where I just, I don't want to news anymore because the news is hard.

1578
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:53.000
It's there to get you angry, so you'll pay attention to it and gets them better ratings.

1579
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:58.000
And a lot of times when I'll see some really extreme things that they're claiming people said,

1580
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:04.000
when I dig into it, when I actually take the time to dig into it, it's like not quite what it was.

1581
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:09.000
And now that I've become a lot more introspective.

1582
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
And so I'm paying attention to how things make me react.

1583
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I'm paying attention to when my face flushes out or I grip and I'm like, okay, now it's time to detach and step back.

1584
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:24.000
I've noticed that it's just like, it's not a positive, positive, you know,

1585
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:29.000
thing in my life to have my blood pressure spiked again and again and again and again,

1586
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
because I've got a 24 hour news feed coming in.

1587
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Yeah.

1588
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:39.000
And so another team that I pointed this out to me, he's like, hey, let's talk about the news.

1589
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:44.000
And I was all angry about something and he's like, you know what, I quit watching the news.

1590
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
And he goes, I'm a lot happier since I stopped watching the news.

1591
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
It doesn't matter.

1592
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
And I'm like, are you kidding me?

1593
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Of course it matters.

1594
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:56.000
But he planted a little seed and watered it and then I'm like, okay, I'm going to quit watching the news.

1595
01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Yeah.

1596
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
And it doesn't matter.

1597
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:03.000
And I was to the point where I'll just check the news like first thing in the morning to make sure

1598
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000
of volcano and stuff.

1599
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Right.

1600
01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Now I don't even do that.

1601
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
If there's a volcano going off, I'll see the smoke or someone will tell you.

1602
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Yeah, you're going to find out about it.

1603
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000
The 24 hour news cycle is filled with a lot of things that you don't need to know.

1604
01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000
You don't need to know at all.

1605
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
And that's the kind of way I am.

1606
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I mean, I still look at it, but it doesn't.

1607
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000
I'm completely, I can look at, I can look at 19 headlines in a row.

1608
01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:30.000
And none of them have any remote impact on my mentality at all until I see one that says,

1609
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Oh, there was a terror bombing here.

1610
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
And I go, okay, let's see what's going on or.

1611
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Hey, there was a US servicemen killed here and I'm like, okay.

1612
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:43.000
But every other of the 17 headlines that I read that were,

1613
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:47.000
I'm trying to think of a good one right now because they're just, you know,

1614
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.000
everything is going down.

1615
01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000
I don't even like, okay, fine, yeah, I admit, no, everything's not going down.

1616
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
The world isn't going to end.

1617
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000
But it's clickbait isn't.

1618
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Yeah, it is.

1619
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.000
And I, you guys are the first ones I heard used that word.

1620
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
I'm like, oh, that's what that is.

1621
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1622
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Was exactly what it's going on, clickbait, but it's just clickbait on the TV to get you

1623
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.000
to dial in and get them higher.

1624
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Oh, yeah.

1625
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.000
And then we got to listen that Sam Harris and I forget the females name that was on,

1626
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.000
but she did this whole research about it talking about how the Russian,

1627
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
the Russian bots and all that stuff.

1628
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000
And yeah, you can create headlines that are going to make people click.

1629
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000
And then you can make fictional random, you can just make up stories.

1630
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.000
I know.

1631
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:34.000
And people catch, you know, someone else will report that story as being true.

1632
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000
It's a crazy world.

1633
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
The onion, is that joke and newspaper?

1634
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Yeah, they've got their A.P. is picked.

1635
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Their stuff up like two or three times before.

1636
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Totally nuts.

1637
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:50.000
So you've got to learn, you should definitely add a middle mom learn to detach when you read the news.

1638
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Yeah.

1639
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:57.000
And then something that I found real helpful is, is putting a filter on my thoughts.

1640
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:02.000
So the, and as is something that Iris is kind of talked about.

1641
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
She's like the first filter is am I whining?

1642
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.000
And then the second filter is am I resentful?

1643
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000
And then the third filter is am I jealous?

1644
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:19.000
And if I can just catch that stuff, once I identify it, it doesn't bother me anymore.

1645
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:24.000
But prior to identifying it, if I'm just like, oh, someone told you,

1646
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.000
just got a promotion.

1647
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000
That's bullshit.

1648
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.000
He, you know, and then I realized, wait a minute,

1649
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000
I should be happy for him for getting that promotion.

1650
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:37.000
And Jordan Peterson says something about be careful

1651
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000
who you share good news with.

1652
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000
And, and, and I just don't, that's not, that's not something I, I,

1653
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.000
I'm proud of when I see it come up in myself and that's one of the things that,

1654
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:57.000
that as I age, I'm, I'm trying to fix the other thing that that as I've gotten older is I used to be very

1655
01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
group identified with.

1656
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.000
And now I find myself becoming more of an individual.

1657
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000
If that makes sense.

1658
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.000
And this, this is, that's where I'm trying to go.

1659
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000
And this is, this is the path that, that I'm on.

1660
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
And it's, it's a struggle.

1661
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000
And it all comes down.

1662
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.000
And I kind of wish there was two words for ego, right?

1663
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Because the ego, if I didn't have an ego driving me to be better,

1664
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.000
yeah.

1665
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
I, I would just be sitting at home, meeting chocolate and cookies on the couch.

1666
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Right.

1667
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
There's not two words to describe ego, but there is the dichotomy of it.

1668
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And then you're good to go.

1669
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Yeah.

1670
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.000
You know, one of my team guy buddies, a long time ago,

1671
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:46.000
we could use this phrase, which I, which I always remembered because I thought it was really good.

1672
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Basically someone was whining about something.

1673
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
And you know, you know, raise their hand and say,

1674
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
well, you know why we're doing this.

1675
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000
And then afterwards, my buddy goes, hey, that's cool.

1676
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Put yourself on report for being a bitch.

1677
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:05.000
And so like, I've been hypersensitive to that for a long time.

1678
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000
I do not ever, you know, I don't care what I'm going through.

1679
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
I will not complain about anything.

1680
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Like I am hypersensitive about that.

1681
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000
At least I try to be, I mean, you know, cold,

1682
01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
and I'm not going to say anything.

1683
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
You know, hurt.

1684
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000
I hurt my knee.

1685
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000
And I, my knee was also one of all jacked up.

1686
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
And I didn't tell anyone.

1687
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
I was a little bit, hey, I injured my knee.

1688
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000
No, no factor.

1689
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
And finally, life was like, hey, you know,

1690
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000
what's up with your knee?

1691
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.000
I said to my picture.

1692
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Like the knee is just twice as big as the other one.

1693
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
He's like, oh, my God.

1694
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Are you going to need surgery?

1695
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000
I'm like, no, no factor.

1696
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.000
But, and I only sent it to him like six or seven days.

1697
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
The swelling had gone down.

1698
01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
But out of the gate, I wasn't going to say anything because I don't,

1699
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000
I don't want to sit there and complain.

1700
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Like, bro, I hurt my knee.

1701
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Doing Gigiitsu.

1702
01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Oh, no.

1703
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000
You know what I mean?

1704
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Like, come on, bro.

1705
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000
I'm not going to complain about that.

1706
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000
But yeah, those are other things about being resentful and being jealous.

1707
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Whenever I feel that tension of,

1708
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
when I feel that tension of jealousy,

1709
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000
when I feel that tension of, when I feel like,

1710
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
when I feel like mad at someone,

1711
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
for doing something, I automatically know it's me.

1712
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
I automatically, and I've known that for years.

1713
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
There was a stone or as a matter of fact,

1714
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000
was going to, he wanted to go to Princeton.

1715
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000
And he, he said to me, he, and he,

1716
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000
I wasn't, we weren't together at Team 3 anymore.

1717
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
And so he was talking to some people.

1718
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000
And finally, he comes to me and he says,

1719
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
hey man, I want to go to Princeton.

1720
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I want to put together this package and go to Princeton.

1721
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.000
He said, but some of the other people I'm talking to

1722
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
are telling me it'd be bad for my career.

1723
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.000
And I'm like, bro, those guys are just jealous.

1724
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000
That's not happening.

1725
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000
I go, you go and you get your freaking degree from Princeton.

1726
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Are you kidding me?

1727
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
How is that going to be bad for any day,

1728
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
and he did, he ended up doing it. And he got, he got it,

1729
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
and he got accepted.

1730
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.000
And, but that was one of those things where it was so obvious to me.

1731
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Like whoever told you that is just telling you that,

1732
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000
because they don't want you to have another punk car to pull on you.

1733
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Because like, hey, your stone or your, you know,

1734
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
you've got a bunch of combat experience,

1735
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
you've got a bunch of combat awards,

1736
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
your, your, this big strapping dude,

1737
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
and by the way, you're going to go to Princeton.

1738
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Like no one wanted that final punk car to be issued this donor.

1739
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000
It's hard when you see someone else that's successful.

1740
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
And you know that like,

1741
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000
I should be getting up off my ass and getting into Princeton myself,

1742
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
or going, you know,

1743
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000
you can't control whether or not you're deployed to combat.

1744
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000
But a lot of other stuff is,

1745
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000
and I think that's where it gets painful for guys.

1746
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000
It's like, okay, well, I'm not going to make the effort.

1747
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000
So I don't want anybody else to make the effort either.

1748
01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
I'm a crab in this bucket, and I'm going to drag that crab

1749
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
that's trying to climb out back in the bucket.

1750
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000
And this is actually in a way the warrior could three.

1751
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
This is why I had to address this,

1752
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000
which in a way the warrior could three, you know, have you read it yet?

1753
01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Not yet.

1754
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
It's a way the warrior kid,

1755
01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
there's a new character that comes as a name as Danny Ryan Hart.

1756
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000
And he's like good at everything.

1757
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
He's better at Mark than everything.

1758
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000
He's like a little bit smarter,

1759
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
it does better on the test in school,

1760
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000
and he's a little bit faster,

1761
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
and he can do more pull ups,

1762
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
and then like to take the cake,

1763
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000
because he's a new kid moves in,

1764
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.000
and Mark still thinks he's got the ultimate punk card to pull,

1765
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
which is I do due to get to,

1766
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
and I can choke you some of the other stuff matters.

1767
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000
It turns out Danny Ryan Hart's been training for two more years.

1768
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
And that's exactly what happens.

1769
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Mark, instead of saying,

1770
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000
wow, I can learn from you, wow, you can help me, wow.

1771
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.000
That's awesome.

1772
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.000
I know you work hard for that,

1773
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
instead he just tries to undermine and he just is jealous.

1774
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
And so that's something that you deal with when you're starting to be,

1775
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
even as a little kid, you know?

1776
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Yep, as you've got a little kid, you can be jealous.

1777
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.000
So checking to check yourself,

1778
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000
if you're being resentful, if you're jealous of someone,

1779
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000
those are like the first things I check when I start getting mad at someone,

1780
01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000
those are the first things I check when I start getting mad at someone I go,

1781
01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000
and I be in jealous right now, yes I am.

1782
01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Yes I am.

1783
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Yes I am.

1784
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Yeah, that is not good.

1785
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
And what's worked out really well for me,

1786
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000
is when you identify these people that are good at everything,

1787
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
keep them around you.

1788
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Oh, for sure.

1789
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000
For sure.

1790
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000
And that's the other the other clincher in the way the word you could

1791
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000
three is Danny Reinhardt.

1792
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000
He's not only like better, he's also like a really nice kid.

1793
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Yeah.

1794
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
And so that makes Mark even madder.

1795
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Because everyone wants to be friends with him.

1796
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Yeah, because he's nice.

1797
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
So yeah, you got to watch out for that.

1798
01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Check yourself.

1799
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Don't get that.

1800
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:37.000
I wanted to talk about some leadership mistakes that you've made.

1801
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.000
And I was thinking myself, well, I could call out Jason for leadership

1802
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
mistakes that he's made.

1803
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
That's kind of jacked up if I don't talk about it.

1804
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000
I mean, leadership mistakes that I've made.

1805
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Now, of course, I've listed a bunch of leadership

1806
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000
mistakes that I've made in that kind of be of leadership

1807
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000
and an extreme ownership.

1808
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000
So there's that.

1809
01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000
But I got a couple that I thought of.

1810
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
And I'll try to think of some broad ones.

1811
01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:02.000
One of them is when I was in Ramadi.

1812
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
I hate to start off like that.

1813
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000
When I was in Ramadi, I did not do a,

1814
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.000
as good a job as I should have.

1815
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000
And I'll go a little bit further.

1816
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:20.000
To keeping the rest of our community informed as to what was happening

1817
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000
and why it was happening.

1818
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000
And to be honest with you, the reason I say I'll go further

1819
01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000
than I just didn't keep them informed, I wasn't even thinking about it.

1820
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000
I wasn't even thinking about it.

1821
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:34.000
When I got home and one of our good friends said to me,

1822
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:38.000
and he was all fired up and he's like, we were reading your,

1823
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.000
he's like, we read your A, R's or quarters every day.

1824
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Like, so every day at trade at at the time while we were in Ramadi,

1825
01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.000
they were reading the A, R's, the after action report for the A.

1826
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000
They killed nine guys.

1827
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000
They killed seven guys.

1828
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000
And that's, you know, I was like, hey, that's awesome.

1829
01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000
That's cool.

1830
01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.000
I didn't really even think of that.

1831
01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000
But what I also didn't think of was guys that were saying,

1832
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
hey, wait a second, what do these guys doing over there?

1833
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Wait a second, wait, why are you conducting operations during the day time?

1834
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Hey, wait a second, why are you staying out after you get contacted?

1835
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Why are you staying in position?

1836
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Hey, wait a second, why are you working alongside the conventional forces?

1837
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Why aren't you doing stuff with just special operations?

1838
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:27.000
And I did a bad job of explaining these things to our community as a whole.

1839
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000
And even when we got back, I had the opportunity to do it.

1840
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000
And I spread the word to some people and was able to explain to them.

1841
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000
But by then, some people had already thought, oh, well, these guys were just over there.

1842
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Do doing these rogue operations by themselves and they shouldn't have been doing it.

1843
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:46.000
So that's, that's one, that's one big one that I wish it would have done a better job.

1844
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
And I just, I just wasn't even paying attention.

1845
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:55.000
And you know what it's like, man, I mean, this is my, this is my excuse is my, it's my fault.

1846
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Because I was over there and I'm thinking like, hey, we got an opportunity.

1847
01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.000
And like, hey, we got an operation tomorrow. I got two, I got two elements going out of the field.

1848
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000
I'm not worried about what they're thinking.

1849
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Like, I just didn't even think of it. And I should have.

1850
01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000
So I don't know if that's an excuse. It's the reason why I didn't think of it way.

1851
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
I should have. And I was wrong for not doing that.

1852
01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000
How much bandwidth could you have expanded on it though in the moment?

1853
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:21.000
You know what? If I would have been a little bit smarter and a little bit better,

1854
01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.000
I could have taken 15 minutes to send out an email and say, hey, everyone,

1855
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000
want to let you know what this up was really like, is there really the obsomes, right?

1856
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:33.000
The obsomes is an official document. If I could have supplemented that with hey guys,

1857
01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Joko here, I know this one sounds a little bit crazy. Here's what's going on.

1858
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:41.000
The Iraqi soldiers that we're working with, they don't have night vision.

1859
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:47.000
They have one flashlight, purifier team to go out at night with these guys is completely,

1860
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:52.000
it doesn't work. And so we got to go out in the daytime with them sometimes.

1861
01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.000
And so that's what we're doing. Here's why we're doing it. You know,

1862
01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:00.000
I could have done it. I could have expanded a little bit and I just didn't have the awareness that I should have had

1863
01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.000
to explain these things. Also to explain them in plain English.

1864
01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Because it's one thing to read the obsome. That's an official document.

1865
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
That's written a certain way. It's another thing to say, hey guys,

1866
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Joko here. Here's what's going on.

1867
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Because I mean, let's face it at that time. I'd been in for a long time.

1868
01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000
And I had friends everywhere. I mean, and when my friends would reach out to me,

1869
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
this is probably should have been my best indicator.

1870
01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Some of my friends that reached out to me and said, hey dude, what's going on?

1871
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Like, I heard you just got to go, I heard one of you guys got shot.

1872
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:37.000
What's going on? How's that happening? And I had one specific friend of mine who wrote me like a long email.

1873
01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.000
And I wrote him back, right? And today, man, this is what's going on.

1874
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.000
But that should have been an indicator if one of my friends was reaching out to me and saying, hey,

1875
01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:51.000
what's going on? I should have been more cognizant in the fact that people beyond.

1876
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.000
And people that didn't know me at all, you know, would be thinking, you know,

1877
01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000
well, this guy's a hyper aggressive and they're just out there,

1878
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:05.000
taking too many risks. It's like, no. And what was cool was there was some guys that were in

1879
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Ramadi, other seals that were in Ramadi are working in and around Ramadi at the time,

1880
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.000
who I knew. And they were like, you guys are crushed. You guys are doing great.

1881
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:17.000
This is awesome. Yeah. But I didn't do a good job. So that's that's one thing.

1882
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I don't know what it looked like for your perspective. Where were you when I was there?

1883
01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:28.000
In Paycom, pull side at Thailand, explaining to my guys why we had to put the missions first.

1884
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Yeah, check, check. Yeah.

1885
01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:37.000
But at the time, I was excited for you guys because it was like the, that was like the first

1886
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:46.000
sustained heavy combat of that war. Yeah. Yeah. Everything had been.

1887
01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:51.000
We were talking about the big news to stand around and talk about when you were at

1888
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:56.000
the bar was was maybe a tick or a firefight lasted five minutes.

1889
01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Yeah. And you guys were troops in contact a hundred percent of the time every time

1890
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.000
you walked outside the gate. Yeah. It wasn't quite that, but it was a lot. Yeah.

1891
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:09.000
And then that's for sure. And that's what that's what I think I think I should have explained that better

1892
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:13.000
than I did throughout the community. And you know, I still talk guys.

1893
01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.000
I still have the opportunity when I was, you know, some guys that I'll, I'll still explain this to some guy

1894
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000
that I haven't seen because you know, as you run to have a few, you know, seen in 15 years.

1895
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Yeah. They'll be like, do what you do over there.

1896
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Okay. Let me explain it to you. I've had people sit through kind of the, the Ramadi brief

1897
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:33.000
and be like, okay, I get it. I get, yeah, that makes sense. Roger.

1898
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.000
But yeah, should have done a better job of that from a leadership perspective.

1899
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:43.000
I was trying to think of a tactical example of, and this is really easy story.

1900
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Once I'm my personally chased down some dude over multiple rooftops as a, in Baghdad, you know, like

1901
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:52.000
just got in the one man pursuit, well, I had another guy like trailing me, but

1902
01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:59.000
basically, we're hitting a target. There's a squirger. I'm outside the building as it's

1903
01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.000
happening and also, you know, the, the overhead asset reports that there's a squirger

1904
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:11.000
and he jumped to another rooftop. And I had a radio, the radioman was like near me.

1905
01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:16.000
And we both know the radioman. And he's like, hey, he's like, you went to the next roof.

1906
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:23.000
And I was like, got him. And so I climb up a palm tree, a climb up a palm tree, like

1907
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.000
in between a palm tree and like the garage and I get to the roof and I get and

1908
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.000
he's like, he jumped to the next one and so the radio, the J attack is in the street

1909
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:35.000
with me following down and telling me what's going on. And basically, I left my, I

1910
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000
shouldn't have done that. You know, I should have sent a couple guys and eventually

1911
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:43.000
I got with someone else with me and then we got the guy. But you know, I just was trying

1912
01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:48.000
to have, hey, where did I make some mistakes? Where that were more on a tactical level.

1913
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:55.000
And that's one right there is, you know, I'm in charge of the assault. And if I'm out there

1914
01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.000
chasing the guy from the rooftop, I'm not doing my job.

1915
01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:05.000
But they did have it on video. And it was pretty awesome to watch.

1916
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:10.000
And I tried to get a hold of it. But of course, it's classified so I couldn't have it.

1917
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:15.000
It was pretty cool to watch, you know, you can like park or in the pit.

1918
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Yeah, it's going to palm tree and then jump from rooftop roof and then eventually

1919
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:26.000
they're like, hey, so that one right there. And yeah, so that was one.

1920
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.000
And then the last thing again, I was trying to think of like a variety of different

1921
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000
mistakes. And here's something from a leadership perspective that I really,

1922
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
when I look back, I wish I would have done a better job. And that's helping guys with

1923
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:43.000
their finances. Young guys. I mean, how many young guys

1924
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:49.000
reinlaced, they get $150,000 reinlustment bonus. And they show up at work two days later.

1925
01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:55.000
They've got a new Ford F350 super duty, Harley Davidson version.

1926
01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:00.000
And they have, you know, they have a $62,000 truck.

1927
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000
That is now worth, they just had it for a day. And they've now worth 48,000.

1928
01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.000
So they already lost money. And guys that would rent instead of bought, you know,

1929
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:13.000
just all those things where, and I wasn't like super at it.

1930
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000
But I was ahead. And I should have been telling guys like, hey, man, let me talk to you.

1931
01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Hey, guys, let's do a little, let's do talk for a half an hour about where you're at.

1932
01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Right now, let's come up with a strategic objective of where you're going to be in five

1933
01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
years. You know, T.E.S. don't want to be renting apartment in IB.

1934
01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Because that's probably not great. Or do you want to be buying a place, get with one of your buddies.

1935
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:42.000
So I never talked about that kind of stuff. And again, what it boils down to is my own,

1936
01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.000
my own being obsessed. Like, I didn't care about that stuff. You know what I mean?

1937
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:53.000
I guess I cared about it enough to do it. And I got lucky. I had an officer one time.

1938
01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:58.000
That said, I bought a house every three years and kept it. He just said that to me.

1939
01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.000
And I was like, that seems like a really good idea. And that's what I tried to do.

1940
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.000
But I didn't pass that word on. And I could probably help out more guys.

1941
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
So kind of a bummer on that one.

1942
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:17.000
I, yeah, because that aspect, I completely dropped the ball on that early in my career as well.

1943
01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Later on, I got a little bit better at it. But, you know, because I didn't 30.

1944
01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000
But I could tell a guy how to be a good shooter.

1945
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Yeah. But then I didn't look at the whole rest of the dang pie chart.

1946
01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:35.000
And realize that if I fixed all that other stuff,

1947
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000
they'd be any better shooter.

1948
01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Exponentially better. Right?

1949
01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:45.000
And, yeah, that, that was something that, that actually helping guys.

1950
01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:50.000
And then we're stuff that, this is, this is something I really failed at is like,

1951
01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000
I could see guys messing up.

1952
01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.000
But I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation with them.

1953
01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.000
So like, bro, you got to, you got to kind of fix this.

1954
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Like, hey, you know, you've used the analogy before.

1955
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I have a booker hanging out. I want somebody to tell me.

1956
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000
And so I see, you get mad at them.

1957
01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Who's talking about, I wanted that booker there.

1958
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.000
No, I, I definitely wouldn't.

1959
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000
I had some of those conversations for sure.

1960
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
And I'm sure you did, too. Like, hey, this girl.

1961
01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000
She's not the one. I'm going to tell you that right now.

1962
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Uh, this isn't going to work out well for you.

1963
01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:32.000
The problem is getting somebody to listen to that conversation is real hard when it comes to the ladies.

1964
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Yeah, and that aspect of just, most times it blows up in your face.

1965
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:41.000
And then sometimes you're just like, hey, I realize that maybe I'm going to lose my friendship with you.

1966
01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000
True.

1967
01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:46.000
But, uh, I got to tell you this.

1968
01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:55.000
And later on in my career when I started to start like struggling with anger issues.

1969
01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.000
And it were probably a result of my combat deployments.

1970
01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000
And started to go sit down with a psych.

1971
01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:04.000
And I would see, you know, you were super angry even before.

1972
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:09.000
I was like, I was like probably pretty pretty predisposed to it all.

1973
01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000
And I just met, it just turned it up to 11, right?

1974
01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.000
And, uh, and then I would see myself and other guys.

1975
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000
And I would tell him, hey, man, here's the deal.

1976
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Here's the psych's number.

1977
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
I want you just to give them a call.

1978
01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.000
And you don't have to see him after that, but do me this favor.

1979
01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:33.000
And some guys it would help and other guys, I made the effort.

1980
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.000
And they'll come to that conclusion at some point.

1981
01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.000
But it's like, son, you know, we got to look out, look out for each other and do the best we can.

1982
01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.000
And that was something that, you know, missed out on.

1983
01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Uh, I think I probably would have made an awesome platoon chief about the time I was an ops master chief.

1984
01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Two echelons above it and really realized what that job was because that as a platoon chief,

1985
01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:06.000
one of the things that I missed out on was that the guys are always looking at me to set the example.

1986
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:15.000
And so it was one thing during working hours like it's set an example, but if I'm a buffoon out drinking too hard, they're like you're an idiot.

1987
01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Or they follow your example.

1988
01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:22.000
And they they'll follow my example and think that this is acceptable behavior.

1989
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Uh, if if I'm going to bad mouth my leadership, which is I'm embarrassed to say it, but it's just stuff that if I didn't.

1990
01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Didn't really have my aperture open on the big picture and would complain about the command and then I complain in front of the guys just screwing them over.

1991
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.000
And I did because they're like, well, he's whining.

1992
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Yeah.

1993
01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Now I'm going to go ahead and whine.

1994
01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Uh, I had issues where like personally I didn't like the person that I was working directly for.

1995
01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:01.000
And that that tainted my interaction with that person.

1996
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000
I didn't have any relationship with them.

1997
01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:15.000
And then my whole platoon would suffer because I had a bad relationship with the next guy up just because I didn't like them, which is complete weak sauce.

1998
01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Oh yeah, I was having a conversation with Dave Burke.

1999
01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Yeah.

2000
01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:30.000
And it was we had that he just quoted me yesterday, I was hanging out with him and with the quote was like whatever six months ago, we're having a conversation.

2001
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:42.000
And I said something like, hey, Dave, whether I love you or hate you, you won't know either way.

2002
01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:50.000
And he was like, he said, well, it kind of freaks me out because you're super nice to me and now I think you could just hate me and don't care.

2003
01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000
And you know, we laughed about it.

2004
01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.000
But that's exactly right. And that is the truth.

2005
01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Like the guys that I hated never knew it.

2006
01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.000
I mean, to this day, they don't know it.

2007
01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:10.000
And so I mean, you and I were having a conversation about a couple of people that I obviously don't like at all.

2008
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
They don't know that.

2009
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.000
So you've got to be professional at all at all times.

2010
01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
And it's a very small number of people.

2011
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Most people are pretty cool to me, you know, and most people support what I'm trying to get done.

2012
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
So I'm pretty lucky in that way.

2013
01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000
But yeah, if you let that out, that's bad.

2014
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Is there ever really a reason not to be polite?

2015
01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Yeah, very seldom.

2016
01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Yeah.

2017
01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.000
You could politely punch someone in the face.

2018
01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:41.000
And you could just punch him in the face.

2019
01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Here's what people can do.

2020
01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Here's what people can do.

2021
01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Here's what people can do.

2022
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
You know, that's what you're talking with, Joko.

2023
01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Your kiss ass.

2024
01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
It's like, actually, let me tell you what I actually want to do.

2025
01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:55.000
What I actually want to do is I want to sap my batoon, able to get the sport that they need.

2026
01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.000
What I actually want to do is I want to be able to have my batoon get the sport that they need.

2027
01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.000
So that we can actually do a better job doing our mission.

2028
01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000
That's what I'm doing.

2029
01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000
What I care about is my guys and my mission.

2030
01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000
That's what I actually care about.

2031
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:12.000
And if I've got to be polite to someone to make that happen, if I've got to overlook the fact that someone might not be the personality type that I particularly like,

2032
01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.000
I don't care.

2033
01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000
I don't care.

2034
01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Guess what?

2035
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000
I'm going to deal with it.

2036
01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:20.000
I'm going to accept that I'm going to absorb whatever kind of crap that they want to throw.

2037
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
And I'm going to deal with it.

2038
01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:22.000
It's fine.

2039
01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Now, do you get into situations where you actually have a bad boss that you have to show?

2040
01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Let's face it.

2041
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:38.000
If I'm treating you like a piece of shit or I'm making really bad decisions and all you do is support me and you're a yes man,

2042
01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
well your guys are going to lose respect for you.

2043
01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.000
So there's times where you have to say, hey, listen guys, the years what's going on.

2044
01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000
I don't agree with everything that the boss says, but you know what?

2045
01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
He's the boss right now.

2046
01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:55.000
And what we're going to do is try the easiest way the way for me to get him to make better decisions is if he trusts me.

2047
01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
So right now what we're going to do is we're going to kick ass.

2048
01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000
And so suck it up, quit complaining.

2049
01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:06.000
We're going to do a great job and I'm going to get a better relationship over him where he will start listening to me and we'll move forward.

2050
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:11.000
And by the way, unless we're going to have a mute me, which we're not going to have.

2051
01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
This is the best option.

2052
01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:18.000
The other option is me to have an antagonistic relationship with the boss in which case all he's going to do is screw us over.

2053
01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
So how do you guys want to play this?

2054
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.000
You know what I mean?

2055
01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:24.000
So sometimes you've got to be transparent about that stuff and that's fine too.

2056
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.000
I mean, I've been in situations where I've had to do that where it's like, okay, hey guys, here's what's going on.

2057
01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
I know this seems a little bit crazy.

2058
01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:33.000
I know that the boss may seem like he's making a rash decision on this.

2059
01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Here's what we're going to do.

2060
01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Let's explain his perspective.

2061
01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Here's what the boss is seeing.

2062
01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.000
He doesn't want this to happen again.

2063
01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000
He's tightening the news.

2064
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.000
He's tightening the bleach way more than I want him to.

2065
01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000
But guess what?

2066
01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Let's show him that he can let loose on the leash again.

2067
01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Let's get in line.

2068
01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
You'll see, you've got to have those conversations sometimes.

2069
01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.000
But broadly, I'm going to get along with everybody.

2070
01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Why not?

2071
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.000
I want to do my mission.

2072
01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:59.000
I want to take care of my guys the best way to do that is if I have good relationships up and down the chain of command.

2073
01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Boom.

2074
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Oh, question.

2075
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000
What?

2076
01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.000
So, and you know I don't like you.

2077
01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000
In your even in secret.

2078
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000
In your view.

2079
01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
The secret is out.

2080
01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Yeah.

2081
01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.000
That's kind of got that either way.

2082
01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
In your view, what?

2083
01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
What's the difference between that?

2084
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.000
How you say, like you get along, like even if you don't, if you really don't like someone they don't ever know.

2085
01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000
In your view, what's the difference between that and being like, oh, what do you go like?

2086
01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Like a two face or a, you know, like let's say, all these are two face person or whatever.

2087
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Well, one big thing is I'm not, I'm not, I'm not getting along with some sort.

2088
01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:34.000
I can, so that I can better my own life.

2089
01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
I'm not doing it, so I can take care of me.

2090
01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Yeah.

2091
01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Because I don't really care about me.

2092
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.000
I'm doing it, so I can do my job well, so I can take care of my petun, so I can take care of my team, so I can accomplish my mission.

2093
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000
That's number one.

2094
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
If I'm doing it, so I can get the promotion.

2095
01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:48.000
I'm actually the guy that I don't like.

2096
01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:52.000
The guy that's like, oh, I'm doing this, so I can get promoted, no, I'm not doing that.

2097
01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
And that's another thing.

2098
01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
The troops see through that every single time.

2099
01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Everybody knows.

2100
01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.000
They have a name for it in the teams.

2101
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
That guy is a ticket puncher.

2102
01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:01.000
They're trying to get their ticket puncher.

2103
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Oh, he's just trying to get his ticket punch.

2104
01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:07.000
He's trying to grab onto that guy's, grab a hold of that person's coat tails and ride him up.

2105
01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
You know, ride him up to the neck rank.

2106
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
It's like, no, everyone sees through that.

2107
01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.000
If you're doing the right thing, so the right reasons people are like, hey, you know what?

2108
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Jocquille, you're, I mean, every time people look, do your patient guy.

2109
01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Leave Babin told me that.

2110
01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.000
And he said, hey, you're so patient.

2111
01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:21.000
I don't see how you do.

2112
01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000
I don't see how you do it.

2113
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.000
You know, this is when he was younger.

2114
01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Like, bro, how do you deal with that?

2115
01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:28.000
I care about our task unit.

2116
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
I will make this happen.

2117
01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
I can absorb some impacts.

2118
01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.000
No factor.

2119
01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Bring it.

2120
01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
I remember when I was working the club.

2121
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.000
And I was in guy.

2122
01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000
What?

2123
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:39.000
That was too face.

2124
01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:42.000
And when I listened to you like, how you're like, oh, yeah, because he said that before.

2125
01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:46.000
They, you like, if you didn't like someone, they probably wouldn't know.

2126
01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:49.000
And I was like, oh, yeah, yeah, they make sense.

2127
01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:53.000
You know, because it, like, it helps the relationship, helps morale, like, helps all these things, right?

2128
01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:57.000
And then, so I think, oh, yeah, a two face guy, there was a distinct difference.

2129
01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:01.000
And one of the main things on top of what you said, because what you said was like,

2130
02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:04.000
I think a little bit more thorough, ultimately view,

2131
02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
mine is a little bit more.

2132
02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:07.000
I should, I say.

2133
02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Strap forward.

2134
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Ground level.

2135
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:10.000
I guess.

2136
02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Can I guess what you're going to say?

2137
02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Sure.

2138
02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Because the other option, the other answer I was going to give is I'm not acting differently than one situation.

2139
02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.000
I don't go.

2140
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Hey boss.

2141
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Yes.

2142
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.000
I got it.

2143
02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000
And then go back for a two-to-go.

2144
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000
He's an idiot.

2145
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.000
No, no, no, no, no.

2146
02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.000
I don't do that.

2147
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000
I go.

2148
02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Hey boss.

2149
02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:29.000
You know what?

2150
02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
And even if it was the situation where I was saying, like, I might go back and tell the guys,

2151
02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:32.000
like, hey, guys, this is what's going on.

2152
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.000
I would tell the boss.

2153
02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.000
I wouldn't say boss.

2154
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000
That sounds like a greatest plan ever.

2155
02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Yeah.

2156
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:36.000
No, I'd say, hey boss.

2157
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
I'm not, I don't think I'm 100% on board with this.

2158
02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
I see some other ways we could give this done.

2159
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:43.000
That's what you're telling me you want me to do.

2160
02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:44.000
I'm going to make it happen.

2161
02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.000
But I think we could, you know, I'm going to, so I don't act differently.

2162
02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:52.000
I'm not a different person in front of, you know, I was doing an event the other day.

2163
02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
And I was like talking to a company.

2164
02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.000
And I was backstage talking to CEO.

2165
02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:00.000
And we were just, you know, and all of a sudden, you know, there's like, he's like,

2166
02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
hey, it's only another half an hour before you go on.

2167
02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Do you need some time?

2168
02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:09.000
And I was like, no, I don't need any time because the person that's going to walk out on that stage is me.

2169
02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
And I'm not acting any different way.

2170
02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.000
It's just me.

2171
02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
I'm going to, you know, I don't need to get into character.

2172
02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.000
I'm in character.

2173
02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.000
I'm walking around on me.

2174
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.000
This is me.

2175
02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:18.000
And he's like, oh, that's awesome.

2176
02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.000
So same thing.

2177
02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.000
I don't, when I'm dealing with the boss that I don't like or whatever,

2178
02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
I don't show that to anybody.

2179
02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Yeah.

2180
02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Act differently.

2181
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:32.000
But you're, you're also, you're doing a good, you're doing a good,

2182
02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:36.000
you're managing what hills are worth dying on.

2183
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:42.000
For sure. When you go to your boss so that you built up that equity with them.

2184
02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:43.000
No doubt about that.

2185
02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.000
When you need it, you can cash it in and that's why you have to establish those relationships with them.

2186
02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:54.000
That's what I really failed as a young leader before my aperture started to get opened up.

2187
02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Before I got introspective and I started thinking about all this stuff from a big picture.

2188
02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000
And then my little ego was in the way.

2189
02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:12.000
And, you know, if you're not, if you're not the guy that is bitching every time when you do bring something up in a respectful manner,

2190
02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.000
then they're going to at least consider what you have to say.

2191
02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.000
And nine times out of ten, they're actually going to go with it.

2192
02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Oh, they're going to go with it.

2193
02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Yeah.

2194
02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.000
That's, that's the, that's the extreme ownership story.

2195
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Yeah.

2196
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:32.000
That's the, and it was me sitting around with your task and to come into the other task and to finish from all the different teams.

2197
02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:35.000
And everyone's, you know, say they got this problem, that problem, the other problem.

2198
02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:41.000
You know, in the, the common or at the time, who was a friend of mine, says, hey, Jocca, what do you need?

2199
02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
And I was like, they sure we don't need anything.

2200
02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:44.000
We're good to go.

2201
02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:49.000
And, you like, it, you know, for whatever reason I was like the last guy to go.

2202
02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.000
So it had even more impact because everyone was complaining about this day and the other thing.

2203
02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Absolutely.

2204
02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:59.000
And he goes, he goes, Jocca, which, they gave it even more impact because he's just like, you know, he knows me because Jocca, what do you need?

2205
02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:08.000
I'm like, nothing sir, we're good to go. And you could say, you know, four months later when I go in there and I say, hey sir, we need X. He goes, cool.

2206
02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Go to supply. I'm calling him right now.

2207
02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Boom, taking care of.

2208
02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
That's, that's how it should be.

2209
02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Another thing that I was thinking about when you were talking, somebody asked me at some point, you know, at which, what point did you start sort of like looking at yourself?

2210
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Kind of what you're talking about. What point did I start to look at myself from an external position and say from a detached perspective and say, wait, are you being jealous? Are you being resentful? Are you complaining?

2211
02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:51.000
I can tell you right now that when I stepped into a leadership position, what I knew was that as you said, every guy in my pool tune is looking at me.

2212
02:03:51.000 --> 02:04:00.000
I looked at myself the same way as a young and less like, my first leadership inside of a tune was as an assistant to him commander.

2213
02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
He was an instant.

2214
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:15.000
And so sure, I was a little bit, you know, when I was an E5, I was always a three-potune E5 and are you an alleaders position? You know, a little bit sure, but not really a little bit.

2215
02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:23.000
When I was a platoon-encin, I was thinking the whole time these guys are looking at me just like I used to look at my officer.

2216
02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:32.000
So if I complain that it's cold or I complain that it's because when my officers used to do that, do this sucks. Oh really?

2217
02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:41.000
I'd be like, I would, I would just, I would, I would get furious.

2218
02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:45.000
And that's why that's the, when I really started looking at myself.

2219
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:57.000
And I'll, quite frankly, when I started putting in an officer package as a young and less like, I was like, wait a second, these guys, I want these guys to think that I actually should be in charge.

2220
02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:03.000
I need to tighten it up. They're looking at me right now thinking, why does Joko think he should be an officer? Here's why.

2221
02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Here's, I need to act like I actually deserve this.

2222
02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:21.000
So that was a real precursor to me looking at myself from the outside saying, I mean, I know what it's like to be an E5 and a platoon looking at the officer going, oh, you forgot that piece of gear, did you?

2223
02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:30.000
And you're in charge of me. You're making more money than me. You're making the decisions tonight on this operation. You didn't bring your hands set.

2224
02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Really? That's where we're at. I know what that felt like. And so I held myself to a high standard because I didn't, didn't want somebody to be looking at me thinking,

2225
02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Joko's complaining. He's weak. He's making up. He's, he forgot a piece of gear. He didn't show up on time.

2226
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:53.000
He didn't show up on time. You know how many times I was late when I was in the US Navy for 20 years?

2227
02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Zero. Zero times late. Zero. Never.

2228
02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Why paranoia? High level of paranoia? Don't want to have guys when my officers relate.

2229
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:10.000
I look at him and think, oh, you can't even show up on time. You're in charge of me.

2230
02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:14.000
You know, that's a young arrogant kid for sure. Absolutely. That's me.

2231
02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:26.000
But I, I, I ate that and I held onto it. And that's one of the first things that made me, and at some point it turned from this kind of hostility

2232
02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:35.000
into like, you need to be a better person. You know, if you're going to be in charge, it went from like this attitude that I'm kind of portraying right now of like, oh, you suck.

2233
02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Into like, hey, you need to do a better job. You need to hold yourself to a high standard.

2234
02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:49.000
You need to be a better person. If you're going to be in charge of these guys, you need to hold the line and you do elevate that line.

2235
02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:59.000
So that had that definitely had a big impact on me. And bro, if anybody knows this, you do, you knew me when I was at E4 20 years old, maniac, right?

2236
02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Yeah. And then you, you know, you ran into me, what, how many years later? You know, it seems a little bit different, you know, not totally different.

2237
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:10.000
But because even when I was a young kid, I was fired up. Oh, yeah.

2238
02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:16.000
But you know, I had to elevate, had to elevate some.

2239
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Yeah, that introspection is something that that I didn't figure out till way later.

2240
02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:27.000
But I'm sure glad I'm dead because I think it paid off.

2241
02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:35.000
It's, that's one of the things and it's one of those things that, you know,

2242
02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Did your dad ever give you any advice?

2243
02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Yeah. So did mine.

2244
02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:46.000
You know, much I listened to. This is about the same amount as I listened to my dad.

2245
02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:55.000
It's one of those things where you, you just, there's some things that you have that, that you, it's like you can't be taught.

2246
02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Yeah, but you, you, you, you, like someone can't tell you this.

2247
02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
For some reason, there's something that people can't tell you.

2248
02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Unless you can just completely open your mind and get humble and put your ego in check, which is really hard to do when you're 22, 23, 24.

2249
02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Like there's things that I look at and I go, oh, you know what I've heard that before.

2250
02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.000
I learned that lesson. I got told that lesson, but I didn't learn it.

2251
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:19.000
But it's, you can pick it up pretty dang quick by, by example.

2252
02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:26.000
And so, you know, how often do you get people asking you, well, how do I get that guy over there to take extreme ownership?

2253
02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Yeah.

2254
02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.000
It's like you do it.

2255
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Yeah.

2256
02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.000
That's true.

2257
02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
You take extreme ownership and it will be contagious.

2258
02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Yeah.

2259
02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Yeah.

2260
02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:42.000
And in, in that manner, when people see those modeled behaviors, then it just goes out.

2261
02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
And it goes back to that thing that,

2262
02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:47.000
that, late talks about, there's no bad teams, there's bad leaders.

2263
02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:52.000
And I've seen groups, seal platoons and seal troops that have broad talent in them.

2264
02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.000
Oh, for sure.

2265
02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:57.000
And then they'll have kind of a guy come in. That's a tyrant.

2266
02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
And an ego maniac.

2267
02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:03.000
And that will permeate into everybody.

2268
02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:09.000
The same way as, you know, the one I see that you're talking about that I've worked around.

2269
02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Everywhere that guy goes, he lifts everybody else.

2270
02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:18.000
Everyone that's around him becomes better by his example.

2271
02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Yeah.

2272
02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Yep.

2273
02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Any other mistakes?

2274
02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Or major mistakes?

2275
02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:33.000
You know, it just back to being when I was a, the troops senior in the U.S.

2276
02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:37.000
The divisor of NAFTA and we were doing the remain over day operations.

2277
02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:42.000
And there were a lot of my younger guys that didn't understand why we weren't going.

2278
02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Why we weren't just going in, hitting a target and coming out during the same cycle of darkness.

2279
02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
They felt like that would be more effective.

2280
02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:54.000
And instead of sitting down with them and explaining to them why we were doing what we were doing.

2281
02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.000
I would just tell them shut up and get out there.

2282
02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:05.000
And, you know, hindsight, not the right thing to do because then they really don't know why they're doing.

2283
02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:14.000
What they're doing and then there's resentment that's building and then they're just not going to be the most effective at what they've got going on.

2284
02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.000
No, man. I wish we could do this whole job over again.

2285
02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:27.000
We kind of can, though. I mean, it goes back to the resentment thing and another bad art word is that regret.

2286
02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Yeah.

2287
02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:35.000
I've learned like all these dang mistakes I've made and every big setback that I've experienced in my life.

2288
02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:40.000
I feel like it's kind of set me up for success through moving forward.

2289
02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:46.000
So it's kind of like glacier, you know, every time I've taken like a foot back, I then move forward.

2290
02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Yeah.

2291
02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:50.000
I learned from it and press on.

2292
02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:57.000
What's interesting for me is as I look back at my career now and I was actually doing this when I was thinking about mistakes.

2293
02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Man, and I was actually talking to Dave Burke, the deal Dave.

2294
02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Yeah.

2295
02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:12.000
And like the things that I talked about all the time now, I did those things like when I was a between the manner.

2296
02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:19.000
I wasn't doing this stuff. I wasn't, I wasn't as crystallized, but like when I was a task commander, I was, this is what I was doing.

2297
02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:34.000
This is what I was doing. It wasn't like I had it crystallized. It wasn't like I had this like, oh, this is what I had seen enough and most of it I'd seen as you just said through modeling from some good officers and from some bad officers and some good chiefs and some bad chiefs.

2298
02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Oh, that's all with that. I'm going to, hey, what does that guy do that? He always tells me what's going, okay, I'm going to always do that. You know, like that kind of thing.

2299
02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:50.000
But like you said, would you get done with a job? You look at him. You're like, man, let me just do that one more time because I will knock this thing out of the park.

2300
02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:59.000
So when is the moment do you think for you that you're the collective light bulb went off and you kind of put a lot of this together?

2301
02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:12.000
The collective well, you know, the first FTX is a trade-out when you got there and that was part of it. Like I like my assistant platoon commander in my OIC.

2302
02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:24.000
I was telling him this stuff, you know, I was like, hey man, here's what's going on. Like, hey, we need to do this. Hey, you, when you going and brief this guy, you need to be like this stuff. I was doing it.

2303
02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:33.000
But then the next deployment, it was like when I was, you know, when I was working with LaF and Seth, you know, it was me saying, hey man, come here.

2304
02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:47.000
And you know, those guys were whip out the freaking, the wheelbooks, you know, like after they realized what was going on, which was like three days into our, our task unit, maybe like hey.

2305
02:12:47.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Check this out. It boom, they'd get out and they'd write down like, okay, this is what, okay, got it. Yes, that makes sense. And, but as far as actually taking it and crystallizing it, I was absolutely my first, the first FTX I went on with trade-out and watch the, watch the task unit out there, just fall apart.

2306
02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:17.000
And, and all I was doing was sitting there thinking, if this was my task unit, number one, here's what I'd be doing. And number two, when I got back, I'd be telling the platoon commander this, this and this.

2307
02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:29.000
I'd be telling those guys, hey, this is where you screwed up and I just was watching it and go, okay, here's, I basically condensed everything that I had told my guys and said, okay, here's what you guys need to do. And that was,

2308
02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:36.000
cover move simple prioritizing, actually decentralized command, the answer is the soul, many, the answer is to all problems.

2309
02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Boy, I'll down to four things and they all kind of overlap. Yeah, they definitely are intertwined and they overlap and you do have to throw extreme ownership on their only because,

2310
02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:54.000
if you don't take ownership of the problems, then they're not going to get solved and that is going to hurt you. So, yeah.

2311
02:13:54.000 --> 02:14:09.000
At the, at the, at the, Mr. J. P. was saying some stuff that really stuck with me and he said it out at the, at the PT and he's like, hey, everybody, we get to be here.

2312
02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:13.000
This is an opportunity that you have to be here.

2313
02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:27.000
And he said that and I thought, man, that is just an awesome perspective to have. I called him up yesterday and like, hey, I want to talk about this and, you know, just fill me on and on what your mind said is,

2314
02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:36.000
and he goes, yeah, he goes, you know, because when he was at buds, the way he looked at a four mile time run, which I hated four mile time runs.

2315
02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Just, I'm throw up every four mile time run. His, his attitude was, I get to do this four mile time run. So, if you take that and you start applying that to everything.

2316
02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Heck yeah, they just don't have, there's no room to bitch about a damn thing.

2317
02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:05.000
You know, I moved through the airport today and I see a guy with no legs and I'm like, man, my life is so good, both my legs work.

2318
02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:09.000
And I shouldn't, I shouldn't have a complaint in the world.

2319
02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Yeah. One of the last thing and we're getting kind of like getting pretty long here, but, you know, one of the things I wanted you to talk about, and I know this isn't really, well, I guess it is, because as a leader of your family,

2320
02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:39.000
I know that we, we have to, we have to lead our family, right? And one of you, you posted something the other day that was for legit, I think it was called a promise to my daughter.

2321
02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:54.000
And I was, I just asked if you could bring it in because I think if you, if you don't mind reading that, to everyone, I think it's a pretty cool set up of how to take ownership of your family and how to, how to, what you, what you, as a leader,

2322
02:15:54.000 --> 02:16:12.000
and as a dad, and as a father, and as a husband, what you are putting forth as your goal, as your objective, as your strategy with your daughter. And I thought it was pretty awesome. So if you would mind reading that, that'd be cool.

2323
02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Absolutely. A promise to my daughter. I will love you always unconditionally, no matter what.

2324
02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:32.000
I will not pamper you. This will forge a resilience that will help you conquer all of life's obstacles.

2325
02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:42.000
I do not entail intent to raise a princess, but rather a warrior, with fire, inner heart, and ice and her veins.

2326
02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:49.000
In my mind, there is nothing you can't do. No job or goal beyond your reach.

2327
02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:55.000
I will challenge you so that you stand confidently on your own to feet.

2328
02:16:55.000 --> 02:17:03.000
And I will set the example on how to treat those you love, so that when you choose a partner, it will be someone that lifts you up.

2329
02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:14.000
I will invest my time and energy in you so that when I am gone, enough memories of me will be with you in your heart to keep forever.

2330
02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:21.000
Stand tall with your shoulders back. This world is yours for the taking.

2331
02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Boom. Yeah, that's awesome, man.

2332
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:32.000
And obviously I would think the same stuff for my son. Yeah, yeah.

2333
02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:38.000
But well, you'll have to write one a little bit specific to him. Very similar.

2334
02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:51.000
Yeah, that's awesome. That's really going on. A, listen to it, and B, play, jirize it, and you know, absolutely.

2335
02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Yeah, for their own family.

2336
02:17:54.000 --> 02:18:00.000
But no, that's awesome, man. And like I said, we're going pretty long right now.

2337
02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:11.000
So I think that's a good place to wrap up this one. What is this now? We've done something like seven or eight hours, seven or eight hours. Awesome.

2338
02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:26.000
So echo speaking of having a strategy to get to where we want to go to be a little bit better across the board in all aspects.

2339
02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:32.000
What do you got for us? Got some tips. Oh, by the way, yeah, I read that on Instagram. If I'm not mistaken.

2340
02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:35.000
And I considered plagiarizing it. Please do.

2341
02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:40.000
My daughter. Now I got the confirmation or what do you guys call it? Clear. Clear hot.

2342
02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:41.000
Yeah, clear hot.

2343
02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:48.000
There you go. And you were right about the two face things when you said, let me guess what you're going to say.

2344
02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Oh, you're actually 100%. Cool. Yeah, like act one way.

2345
02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Hey, boss. Hey, you know, hate some. Hey, you're awesome. You're awesome. You're awesome. And then right when he leaves, then, you know, you see, that guy's actually.

2346
02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Yeah, yeah, so yeah, good.

2347
02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Yeah, good.

2348
02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Yes, we're on the path. Okay. Good.

2349
02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Strategic versus tactical. Long game short game. I know you've been in a long game.

2350
02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:35.000
Pictures, small picture, all the same thing when people ask echo. What's like the big takeaway. I think that's it's primary takeaway is focusing on the long game, which he's a football. So, you know, he likes things the game thing or super Mario Brothers. Sure.

2351
02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:39.000
Moreover, please. But you know, as opposed to thinking short game. Yeah.

2352
02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:47.000
If you look at your life every day, in long game slash strategic instead of short game slash tactical, you're going to end up in a better spot. Yeah.

2353
02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:52.000
And when I say the biggest, I mean, that's the one that applies to like the whole life.

2354
02:19:52.000 --> 02:20:01.000
There's the other stuff. No complaining. That one was a big one. No complaining. No blaming, of course. And then, um, resent.

2355
02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:18.000
And I never had the resent faint. The jealousy thing. That's something I've never really had to do. Yeah. That one to me always felt obvious when I when I discovered like anger, like when you're mad, that's like something up with you kind of thing.

2356
02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
You know, it's natural. Whatever.

2357
02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:36.000
That's one of the biggest, one of the biggest things I got from doing this podcast is Captain Plum saying when they were in the in the Hanoi Hill and him saying, if you were annoyed with your prison bunkmate, it was your fault.

2358
02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:40.000
It was like hit me like a diamond bullet. Yeah.

2359
02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:55.000
Between the eyes. That was extreme ownership. Next level. Yeah. Cause always annoyed with that other person. You know, actually, you know what? That's my fault. Yeah. Yeah. That was good. When I when I discovered it was a book, I was reading called mind games. I mentioned it before.

2360
02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:07.000
And it said small little passage said basically, um, in a nutshell, like when you have anger issues, not to say when you get mad, but just as if you have anger issues, it has something to do with your self esteem.

2361
02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:19.000
Like you have low self esteem. And that hit me really hard. Like, oh man, that hit me so hard that I was like, man, I can never get mad ever again. That's like a reverse psychology on your ego because in your ego is going on.

2362
02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:28.000
I got to turn myself down because I got low self esteem here. Oh, yes, genius. Same thing with the drinking now you put it into words good where kids will drink in right.

2363
02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:38.000
I ended up figuring out or it being revealed to me that, like when you drink when you have a drink, you want another one and you want another one and you're mind and the more you have the more you sort of want, you can't really stop or whatever you don't want to stop.

2364
02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:46.000
It's just your brain tricking you. You know, it's your brain tricking like your brain is chemically saying, oh, we need this. Hey, we need this. You know, we need more or whatever.

2365
02:21:46.000 --> 02:22:02.000
You're going to feel like you were getting manipulated. I felt like I was a sucker as you said and like he wasn't whoa whoa whoa whoa, I'm not a sucker. I don't care if it's my own brain. I'm not a sucker or whatever. And it was just that easy man. That is to control it. But yes, it is a reverse psychology on your ego.

2366
02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Good as opposed to regular psychology on your ego short term and long term. Do you get to right. Yeah, I think you're going to use to read the word reverse reversal.

2367
02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:23.000
That's that's what you're going to handle the transition negative negative. I'm saying I'm on the first long game and short game. Do you choose one of those long game short game.

2368
02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:33.000
The situations 100% part of the path part of the many activities that we're all doing on the path Jason Gardner got into good shape obviously.

2369
02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:41.000
So we're exercising do you get to reading healthy we're not getting mad at people we're not showing resentment. We're not complaining.

2370
02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:57.000
Very so things that will go over anyway, you just what you do just so you could need a key what get we get origin. You get it from origin main dot com this is where all their stuff, by the way, is made all in America from the cotton they grow from the ground all the way to the end.

2371
02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:03.000
From the dirt to the shirt. Sure. Yeah, all that you know, origin main dot com.

2372
02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:16.000
All so it's a American American. Yeah, yes, which we are producing right now. We are hiring more people to produce even more so my apologies on it.

2373
02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:22.000
If you're ordering right now, maybe we don't have your size we're working it or working it hard we're growing.

2374
02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Yeah, that was good some people. I appreciate that they have the 28 inch in seam.

2375
02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Usually I can only get 30. There you go. Combinating everybody. There's a few guys at the master who had a month. I was like, I'll grab a pro.

2376
02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:43.000
I don't have anybody that those are the breaks and that's just the life I live also.

2377
02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:50.000
If sweatpants and shirts and whatnot, other stuff on there's also supplement supplements the best kind of supplements by the way.

2378
02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Yeah, there was some there was some people freaking out on the strawberry star if you tried strawberry star yet.

2379
02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Yeah, that's just not me. Oh, you don't. I'm not not that kind of strawberry guy. I definitely got some and tried it and work.

2380
02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:13.000
I'm a hardcore men chocolate chip and then the vanilla for me. Yeah, you get that vanilla gorilla and throw it inside your coffee.

2381
02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:23.000
Yeah, that's your sweetener kind of that's your eating sugar. Yeah, boom. Yeah, that's good method and then that's Iris is mixing that in everything.

2382
02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:27.000
When you drink that in the morning. Oh, like what time.

2383
02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Like right after I pee tea and then how when you feel hungry for your next meal. Oh, I don't eat until like one 200 to a clock.

2384
02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:44.000
So just that and I was just putting it in everything. She's making milk. Yeah, she's making milk.

2385
02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Can we can smooth these and all that stuff so we go through quite a bit of milk in our house. Yeah, and the kids love it.

2386
02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Yeah, that strawberry can make like it's like a milkshake smoothie hybrid.

2387
02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
Here's what I said the other day.

2388
02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:01.000
If you put in front of me.

2389
02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Hagen does strawberry milkshake, right? Yes, sure. Nestle's strawberry quick and strawberry slayer milk and I was going to die in 15 minutes.

2390
02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:18.000
So we're just going pure satisfaction.

2391
02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:19.000
Sure, sure, sure. Sure, sure.

2392
02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Sure, sure. Sure, sure.

2393
02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:26.000
The long game is out of the picture. I'm going straight to the strawberries. They are milk because that's what tastes the best.

2394
02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:29.000
That is the taste test. Right, no one does the taste test. Like that.

2395
02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:36.000
I'm going to throw some coffee on there but the Hagen dance is going to be sugary or the nesties quick is going to give you a sugar. No.

2396
02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:46.000
We're taking the long game totally out of the picture. We're going pure short term tactical taste where you at strawberry slayer break it.

2397
02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:50.000
The name's awesome, too. Yeah, we're you know.

2398
02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
I'll still join more for you.

2399
02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:59.000
He was trying to like tell me product names and he's like he's like brain someone peacles, you know, pizza like Mr. creative.

2402
02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:16.000
I have to pull out the list. It's so funny. Everything is random military terms.

2403
02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:28.000
But yeah, don't catch Pete. He gets into these moods. Create. He has just coming out of his coming out of his brain and he'll start hitting me up with text about strawberry sniper.

2404
02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Yeah, I'm not that man. It's from the snap that man. He had some ones that are.

2405
02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:37.000
But slayer is better. I'm used to slayer. So when he has snipe her, I'm like, oh, I see why that was like a distant second one.

2406
02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:41.000
I try to think of some of the other whack ones. It's because it's already peered.

2407
02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:51.000
Yeah, some of them were real funny. Actually, I texted him. He texted Brian in me. He texted us all these names. And I was like, okay, stop. No, for part.

2408
02:26:51.000 --> 02:27:00.000
He just started laughing. Yeah, so check that. He probably had a, he had a, he had a, probably had a little too much discipline. Go. Yeah, potential. Yeah.

2409
02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Yeah. How many discipline go are you on right now? Four.

2410
02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.000
Daily. No, per day. Yeah.

2411
02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:11.000
It's just because I had to get up at three a.m. Oh, right. I wanted to be a person. What time did you go to bed at?

2412
02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:19.000
What 10, 10 p.m. So you're on five hours as lead bread. Did you sleep on the plane? No. Can you sleep on planes? Yes. I can see sometimes I can't.

2413
02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:27.000
But I was, I was just writing all these notes and you were ready for this. And sometimes I can just turn it off. But I wasn't able to sleep on the plane.

2414
02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:32.000
I can sleep on planes not as well as echo though echo gets the world champion to belt.

2415
02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:42.000
We're going to play. We're going to play with them within within 38 seconds. He's asleep. He looks he puts his sunglasses on. He looks like he's awake.

2416
02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:45.000
But it's a lie.

2417
02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:49.000
So yeah, so just to be a good situation. I take two every morning.

2418
02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:55.000
Check. So get up in the morning to discipline go and then join warfare.

2419
02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Take a morning and night. Yeah. And I notice a do. How many do you take?

2420
02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Take a two in the morning and two at night and then. And what's your body weight right now?

2421
02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:09.000
One, sixty something like that. I take three. I take three.

2422
02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Join warfare. Three curalloyal morning. Three.

2423
02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:16.000
Three curalloyal night. If I got a little.

2424
02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:21.000
A little situation going on tonight might if I'm around. I'll take three during the day for lunch time.

2425
02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Two.

2426
02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:25.000
So you just got the infusion infusion.

2427
02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:26.000
Infusion.

2428
02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:31.000
So that's that. Yeah. Don't worry about the warrior kid moke to for the warrior kids.

2429
02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Yeah. Well, so all right. Well, let's let's talk about it.

2430
02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:39.000
And what's what in your opinion, or he could moke strawberry or strawberry slayer?

2431
02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Strawberry slayer is thicker. It's like a shake.

2432
02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Yeah. I think actually I think the way that they are they are actually suitable for their audience.

2433
02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
So that's the strawberry.

2434
02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:56.000
The warrior kid strawberry moke is just a little bit a little bit lighter.

2435
02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:59.000
We'll say because it does have less protein.

2436
02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:02.000
And the one the adult one is a little bit heavier.

2437
02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Good. A little bit more like that hog and nose hitter.

2438
02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:06.000
Yeah.

2439
02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:07.000
Just like that.

2440
02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Where you at Theo Vaughn with that hitter.

2441
02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Oh, so also juggle white tea. Yes.

2442
02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Very, very fra... I'm going to say the light, the nice stuff about it.

2443
02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Very refreshing certified organic pomegranate white tea.

2444
02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Doesn't sound hardcore. But he can have to dead lifting 8,000 pounds.

2445
02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:30.000
That is kind of hardcore. Yeah.

2446
02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Proving by the way, chasing burden. Signed, typically.

2447
02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Yeah. You know all about that.

2448
02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:35.000
You know what I'm talking about.

2449
02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:36.000
100% guarantee.

2450
02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Can I get sued for that?

2451
02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.000
You know?

2452
02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Maybe I guess if there was someone that couldn't hit it 8,000 pound deadlift, then they might come at me.

2453
02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Yeah.

2454
02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Come at me, bro.

2455
02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.000
I'll change it.

2456
02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:47.000
You know what I'll say, lift harder.

2457
02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:48.000
Yeah, man.

2458
02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:49.000
Drink more.

2459
02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:50.000
I'll just change it.

2460
02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
Because there's no way everyone else is deadlifting 8,000 pounds.

2461
02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:53.000
What's wrong with you?

2462
02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Good guy, yep.

2463
02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:55.000
Yeah.

2464
02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:55.000
Yeah.

2465
02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:56.000
Make sense.

2466
02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Also, we have a store called Jocco Store.

2467
02:29:58.000 --> 02:29:59.000
I think we all know that.

2468
02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:02.000
This is where you can get rash guards.

2469
02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:03.000
Tea shirts.

2470
02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
You're going to represent this Blin equals freedom.

2471
02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Oh, so I'm like, is the trucker's hats?

2472
02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:09.000
Beenies.

2473
02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Some beenies there.

2474
02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Man, I got to refill the beenies.

2475
02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Oh, thanks.

2476
02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Maybe you don't have beenies there.

2477
02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:15.000
It's good.

2478
02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
Welcome, never wears hats.

2479
02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
So these apparently are no on the pro.

2480
02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
Have you even even had a cold head before?

2481
02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Yeah, I haven't had a cold head before.

2482
02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Sure.

2483
02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:25.000
But I've been.

2484
02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:28.000
Well, depends on what you mean by cold, but, you know, yeah, you put the

2485
02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:33.000
thing on, you know, put that like, like, you know, you just put the coldness on the

2486
02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:34.000
head.

2487
02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Yeah, man, right when you shave it like with the, what do you call the razor?

2488
02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:37.000
No, no.

2489
02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:40.000
They say when you big your head, that's what that's an expression.

2490
02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Oh, yeah, I can get a little lip.

2491
02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:43.000
I guess, kind of cold.

2492
02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:46.000
Well, anyways, the rest of us would like some more beenies online.

2493
02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:47.000
Yes, sir.

2494
02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:48.000
You got it.

2495
02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:49.000
And for the summertime.

2496
02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:50.000
Yes, sir.

2497
02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:54.000
Because if you're up in Maine in the summertime, or you're up in Michigan in the summertime,

2498
02:30:54.000 --> 02:31:01.000
or you're up in Washington in the summertime, once the sun goes down, you can get that little chilly.

2499
02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Yeah.

2500
02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:03.000
Yeah.

2501
02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Yeah, I agree.

2502
02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
And that's how it is here too, in my opinion.

2503
02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
And you might as well have a beenie that says,

2504
02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
discipline equals freedom.

2505
02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
Yeah, man, represent with everything.

2506
02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Also, the hoodies, like I mentioned, lightweight hoodies.

2507
02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Jason, guys, you were done at the mustard.

2508
02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:19.000
It looked good, right?

2509
02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Not bad.

2510
02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Well, thank you.

2511
02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
Oh, now we're on the however one looks at it.

2512
02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Well, well, it's part of the game.

2513
02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:27.000
It can be part of maybe not for you aesthetics.

2514
02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Why is right?

2515
02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:29.000
We got functionality.

2516
02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:30.000
We have aesthetics.

2517
02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:31.000
They're not exclusive.

2518
02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:34.000
Yeah, and you remember I was asking you about the heavy weights, because that's what I,

2519
02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:38.000
but that's what I need up in Northeastern Washington, on Canadian border.

2520
02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:44.000
We are working currently at this time, so that by the time fall walls, it rolls around.

2521
02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:48.000
We offer the heaviest of heavy weight hoodies.

2522
02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Yeah, that's the plan.

2523
02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Yes.

2524
02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
I'm talking big done.

2525
02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:53.000
The real deal.

2526
02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Yeah.

2527
02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:57.000
There'll be no doubt in your mind, but oh, yeah, this is the heaviest hoodie I've ever heard.

2528
02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
We had put non-five pounds.

2529
02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Yeah, that's what we want.

2530
02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:01.000
That's what we want.

2531
02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:02.000
That's what we want.

2532
02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:06.000
But aesthetics, how let's say a factor of 10 is function.

2533
02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
I don't have to answer this question, Jason.

2534
02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:11.000
You need level 10 functionality, obviously.

2535
02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Is that x, what are we, what are you at, what number?

2536
02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:15.000
A 7.

2537
02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
That's pretty significant.

2538
02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:18.000
What are you at?

2539
02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Zero.

2540
02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Zero.

2541
02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:20.000
Straight up zero.

2542
02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:21.000
There's a light light.

2543
02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:25.000
The light weight, anything having to do with fashion.

2544
02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
I think you're at a 1.

2545
02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:28.000
That's what I think.

2546
02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Yeah, no, if there are some things where I'd be like, this looks stupid.

2547
02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
Therefore, I will not wear it.

2548
02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:35.000
So we are correct.

2549
02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:36.000
That puts me on a level 1.

2550
02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:37.000
All right.

2551
02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Well, how about this?

2552
02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
You got three, four t-shirts.

2553
02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:50.000
One green, like green, not owed D green, green green, one red, one black,

2554
02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
one purple, which one each using?

2555
02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:53.000
Why?

2556
02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Looks better, right?

2557
02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Doesn't get dirty as easy.

2558
02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:58.000
No, man.

2559
02:32:58.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Oh, I'm just trying to...

2560
02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Anyway, that punk car.

2561
02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
It was that pulled boy.

2562
02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Anyway, some women's stuff on there too,

2563
02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:10.000
it is jocquistord.com. This is where you can get stuff to represent.

2564
02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Yeah, check it out.

2565
02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Like something, get something.

2566
02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Did you say originmain.com?

2567
02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:16.000
Yes.

2568
02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:17.000
That's for the words somebody does.

2569
02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
I want something that strawberry...

2570
02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:20.000
That's that ear.

2571
02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Of course, man.

2572
02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Of course.

2573
02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:23.000
Yes.

2574
02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Also, strawberries.

2575
02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
They are snapping like a theme.

2576
02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
Like what you say, it should be like in the background.

2577
02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:29.000
It should go strawberry.

2578
02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:30.000
Snorke.

2579
02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:33.000
Got a double-based, wrong hammer.

2580
02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:34.000
Yeah, I'm learning.

2581
02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:35.000
You can do, you can do, you can do, you can do.

2582
02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Yeah, I don't know if I agree with that.

2583
02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:41.000
But, you know, it should be a good name for sure.

2584
02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:44.000
100% also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already on iTunes,

2585
02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:47.000
and wherever you get your podcasts.

2586
02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
And don't forget about the Warrior Kid podcast,

2587
02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:53.000
which comes out not as frequently as it should.

2588
02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:58.000
It should step up this summer as time opens up

2589
02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:03.000
to create and record that particular podcast.

2590
02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:06.000
Yeah, and then you can get some of that Warrior Kid soap.

2591
02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Your friends with Matt, right?

2592
02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:09.000
Mm-hmm.

2593
02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:09.000
Yeah.

2594
02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Up there, Aiden, making it on his farm.

2595
02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:13.000
Irish Oaks.

2596
02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
Yeah, Irish Oaks, Rants.com.

2597
02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
How do you know him?

2598
02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Through Irish?

2599
02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:19.000
He come to your farm?

2600
02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
Yeah, we were going to buy meat from him.

2601
02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
And then when he came to deliver it to you,

2602
02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:24.000
he swung by and visited us.

2603
02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
I was going that day, so I didn't meet him.

2604
02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:29.000
But him and I have chatted on the phone a whole bunch of times.

2605
02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Awesome.

2606
02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Yeah, he's a firefighter up enough at your county.

2607
02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:35.000
And he's got a farm as well.

2608
02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:38.000
And his son, Aiden, was a young Warrior Kid,

2609
02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:43.000
makes soap so that everyone in the world can stay clean.

2610
02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Yep.

2611
02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:45.000
Cool.

2612
02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
That's good soap, too, by the way.

2613
02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:48.000
Yeah.

2614
02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:49.000
The functional soap.

2615
02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:50.000
It's not the decorative.

2616
02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
You know the one that you'll meet makes.

2617
02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:53.000
And it's like here.

2618
02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
It's not even supposed to really use it.

2619
02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:56.000
Yeah, it's a decoration.

2620
02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
Like if you will.

2621
02:34:58.000 --> 02:34:59.000
Mm-hmm.

2622
02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Yes, also.

2623
02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:01.000
We have a YouTube channel.

2624
02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:04.000
The chocolate podcast YouTube channel is where you can get the video version.

2625
02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:05.000
Of course.

2626
02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:06.000
You want to see what Jason looks like.

2627
02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:07.000
Right?

2628
02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:08.000
Handsome.

2629
02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:09.000
Look at you.

2630
02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:10.000
That's it.

2631
02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:11.000
But it'll jocco.

2632
02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:12.000
What?

2633
02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Just take it easy.

2634
02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
Amen.

2635
02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Either way, if you're interested in that,

2636
02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:19.000
we have a YouTube channel.

2637
02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
Also some excerpts on there.

2638
02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:24.000
You know, we'll cut up little excerpts.

2639
02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:28.000
And sometimes Echo puts shallow music behind him.

2640
02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
And he puts explosions in him.

2641
02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.000
Yeah, sometimes.

2642
02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:35.000
When I want to enhance him, maybe like a certain message that you talk about hits me hard.

2643
02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:39.000
I say, hey, let me express this, you know, put some stuff on there.

2644
02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:43.000
Do you ever feel like maybe we should just get a couple of shallow players in here?

2645
02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:44.000
No, I don't.

2646
02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
I don't ever feel like that at all.

2647
02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
And you know, I think we should stick with what we're doing.

2648
02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:49.000
That's my opinion.

2649
02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Here's the thing about YouTube though.

2650
02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
As far as uh, subscribing.

2651
02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:53.000
Yeah.

2652
02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:54.000
So it doesn't even matter.

2653
02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
And you might notice, Jay, do you spend time on YouTube?

2654
02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
Yes, like, okay.

2655
02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:01.000
So here's what I learned and observed.

2656
02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:05.000
If you subscribe to someone in YouTube, it doesn't matter that much.

2657
02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
Like, their stuff won't show up all the time.

2658
02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Like how you would expect, you'd think like, if you subscribe,

2659
02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:13.000
their stuff is going to sort of show up on your way to call it the home.

2660
02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
Yeah, page or whatever.

2661
02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
Doesn't so much do that in you.

2662
02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
But I get an email every time you post something new.

2663
02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Okay.

2664
02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:24.000
Now you're talking because when you subscribe to someone and you do that additional step,

2665
02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
you click on the little bell.

2666
02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:29.000
I think it's like right next to or on the subscribe button or wherever it is right there.

2667
02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:32.000
If you do that, then you'll get the alert email.

2668
02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:36.000
You know, my alerts actually come onto my phone.

2669
02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:40.000
They like, spring up that from YouTube or for your job.

2670
02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
You know, podcast just posted a new video.

2671
02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:46.000
That's from my, from the app from the YouTube app from the YouTube app.

2672
02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:47.000
Yes.

2673
02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:48.000
Which is pretty cool.

2674
02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:49.000
Yeah.

2675
02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:49.000
Yeah.

2676
02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
So if you want that, this is what I'm saying.

2677
02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
So when you subscribe, it's almost like a half subscribed.

2678
02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:54.000
Not even a half.

2679
02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
It's like a quarter subscribed.

2680
02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
That's what it is because you're kind of sort of like,

2681
02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:01.000
Oh, yeah, I officially sort of subscribe, but YouTube, like cool.

2682
02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Okay.

2683
02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:03.000
I think we're not going to let you know.

2684
02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:04.000
We want to subscribe.

2685
02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:05.000
This is way different.

2686
02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:06.000
This is different.

2687
02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:11.000
I'm saying if you want to subscribe and you want to get alerts and you want it to sort of be in your,

2688
02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:14.000
what do you call it, the feed or whatever you got the little bell.

2689
02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:15.000
This is what I'm worried about.

2690
02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:20.000
I'm worried about since you're very decentralized, since there's a lot of decentralized command here.

2691
02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:21.000
Yes.

2692
02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:30.000
I'm worried that if people don't subscribe, all of a sudden you're just going to start putting the little thing at the end of your enhanced videos that says that says,

2693
02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
like she likes.

2694
02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:33.000
Like she likes.

2695
02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Like she shows the little finger click subscribe and if that happens,

2696
02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:38.000
we're going to have a problem.

2697
02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:39.000
Yes.

2698
02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:42.000
The videos make it decentralized real quick.

2699
02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Real quick.

2700
02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:46.000
Well, we're not going to worry about that because I agree with you.

2701
02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:49.000
100% like subscribe.

2702
02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Yeah.

2703
02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:57.000
Maybe before you watch this video, go down to the bottom right click subscribe now.

2704
02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
I'm sure this is not going to be annoying.

2705
02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:00.000
I hate it when I see that.

2706
02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:00.000
Yeah.

2707
02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
But I'm sure there's some function.

2708
02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:05.000
What's the equivalent of when you meet someone?

2709
02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Like what's the equivalent of a human interaction?

2710
02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Where you say that?

2711
02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:11.000
We're going to be like somebody dropping the S bomb.

2712
02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:12.000
Would it be like, yeah, that.

2713
02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
But would you like, like, hey, good to meet you.

2714
02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:15.000
Can I have a pat on the back please?

2715
02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
Like isn't that basically what it is?

2716
02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:18.000
That's the human interaction equivalent.

2717
02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:19.000
Yeah.

2718
02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
Like, okay, nice to meet you.

2719
02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
Give me your phone and I'm going to index.

2720
02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:26.000
I'm going to put my phone over and there.

2721
02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:30.000
So I can text you what I'm doing all the time.

2722
02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:31.000
Yeah.

2723
02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:32.000
Give me a pat on the back.

2724
02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:33.000
All right, sorry.

2725
02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:34.000
No, I might think of that.

2726
02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:38.000
That's actually a little an analogical analog analogy.

2727
02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:42.000
Like comparison task.

2728
02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Think find the analogies.

2729
02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:45.000
What I'm saying.

2730
02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Psychological warfare.

2731
02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
iTunes Google Play and B3 platforms.

2732
02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:52.000
If you want to, if you want to wake up call, which a lot of people say,

2733
02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:53.000
Can't you make an alarm?

2734
02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Can't you make an alarm?

2735
02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.000
Can't you make an alarm?

2736
02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
Yes, you can use psychological warfare as an alarm.

2737
02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
There's a bunch of alarm options there.

2738
02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:00.000
There's also something on there.

2739
02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:05.000
If you're feeling like you want to eat a donut or you want to eat a bag of cheetos,

2740
02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:08.000
yeah, when it's lost to me, you ate a bag of cheetos.

2741
02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
One time I ate a whole bag of Hershey's kisses.

2742
02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
And this is when I was in the teams.

2743
02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:13.000
I'm talking to a grown man.

2744
02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:14.000
How big was it back?

2745
02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:15.000
Like a good size.

2746
02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
Like the size of a book.

2747
02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
It was one of those.

2748
02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
Yeah, it was like six years ago.

2749
02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:25.000
My mom came over to my house and put a whole bag of candy corn.

2750
02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:26.000
It was around Halloween.

2751
02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
And every time I walked by it,

2752
02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:29.000
I was stuffed with things in my mouth.

2753
02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
And pretty soon they're all gone.

2754
02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
You like candy corn?

2755
02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
They're good.

2756
02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:38.000
At the sense, I bet I couldn't eat one right now because I,

2757
02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
You know, kind of cut sweet stuff out.

2758
02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:43.000
And every time I slip, I taste something and like,

2759
02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Holy cow.

2760
02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
The thing I noticed that is with Coca-Cola.

2761
02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
Like I can't even,

2762
02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
I can't even come close to drinking a Coca-Cola.

2763
02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
I'm an admin at one legit like,

2764
02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
I'm an avococcan probably 10 or 15 years or something.

2765
02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:55.000
A long time.

2766
02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:56.000
I don't even have a long time.

2767
02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:56.000
Yeah.

2768
02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:57.000
I don't even have a long time.

2769
02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:01.000
But when I look at them or like the last time I tried to sip one,

2770
02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
I was like, you know,

2771
02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:04.000
Yeah.

2772
02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:05.000
They're like syrup.

2773
02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:05.000
Yeah.

2774
02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:06.000
So anyways.

2775
02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:07.000
Yeah.

2776
02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:07.000
Makes sense.

2777
02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:08.000
Like see that.

2778
02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:09.000
Like you drink.

2779
02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:09.000
Yeah.

2780
02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:10.000
So that's like a lot of warfare.

2781
02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
You can get that on any of those platforms.

2782
02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
Also flip side canvass.com.

2783
02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:15.000
If you want,

2784
02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
if you want the visual.

2785
02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
Remind or something.

2786
02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:24.000
My brother Dakota Meyer has a company called FlipsideCampus.com.

2787
02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
And he's making all kinds of cool stuff.

2788
02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:29.000
He's about to run out some warrior kid stuff too.

2789
02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:30.000
Some little warrior kid.

2790
02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
I like his teddy rose of elves stuff.

2791
02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:32.000
Yeah.

2792
02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:33.000
He's all the after it.

2793
02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:34.000
Yeah.

2794
02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
So he's making some really cool stuff.

2795
02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:37.000
Art.

2796
02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:38.000
Art with layers.

2797
02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Art with layers.

2798
02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:40.000
There you go.

2799
02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:41.000
I like that.

2800
02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
You know, also on it.

2801
02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
You're expanding your home gym.

2802
02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
You get a more kettlebells, which I did by the way.

2803
02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Darth Vader.

2804
02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:49.000
How much is it?

2805
02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:50.000
70.

2806
02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:51.000
Okay.

2807
02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:52.000
He's the thing about the 70 pound.

2808
02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:55.000
Like sure, I'm not, you know, I'm going to be more impressed with your

2809
02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
100 pound kettlebell that you were whatever.

2810
02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
Bragging to me about 106.

2811
02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:00.000
What a stay you go.

2812
02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.000
There you go.

2813
02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:02.000
106.

2814
02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:05.000
But the 70 and the 72, the gorilla,

2815
02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:08.000
want to whatever those in my opinion have the most like play.

2816
02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:09.000
Universal use.

2817
02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:09.000
Yeah.

2818
02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:10.000
Universal use.

2819
02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:10.000
Yeah.

2820
02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:11.000
Yeah.

2821
02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:12.000
That's a great.

2822
02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:13.000
Plus the Darth Vader.

2823
02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:14.000
I mean, come on.

2824
02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:15.000
That's the ultimate one.

2825
02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:16.000
I think.

2826
02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:19.000
But they should, they should have made the Darth Vader like a

2827
02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:23.000
100 at least over 100 pounds in my opinion.

2828
02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
Jason, you're the Star Wars expert.

2829
02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Yeah.

2830
02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:27.000
He should definitely be the heaviest.

2831
02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:31.000
Who's the most powerful character in Star Wars?

2832
02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:32.000
Darth Vader.

2833
02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:33.000
This is, this is one.

2834
02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
He's kind of a Trump some more.

2835
02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:36.000
No, negative.

2836
02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:37.000
No.

2837
02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
You think the Emperor may be, but it's Darth Vader.

2838
02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:40.000
Darth Vader.

2839
02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
You're about to get out of the house.

2840
02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:45.000
I mean, I don't know.

2841
02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:48.000
You know, Darth Maul was pretty dang badass too.

2842
02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:51.000
No, I mean, he's like the dead chopped up pretty quick.

2843
02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
But I mean, Darth Vader lost.

2844
02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:56.000
Darth Vader lost to Luke Skywalker.

2845
02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:59.000
Who crumbled immediately by the way.

2846
02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:00.000
Yeah.

2847
02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:01.000
Later on.

2848
02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:02.000
So it's Darth Vader, man.

2849
02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:03.000
I think it's Darth Vader.

2850
02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:04.000
Yeah.

2851
02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:05.000
I like Vader.

2852
02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:06.000
Mm.

2853
02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:07.000
I'm the last.

2854
02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:11.000
The real leader lifts people up. You ever see that meme and Darth Vader's holding.

2855
02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
That rebel guy up like that.

2856
02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
There you go.

2857
02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
He really needs to lift me up.

2858
02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:18.000
That is so funny.

2859
02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
But Darth Vader went through the whole arc.

2860
02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:21.000
He was good.

2861
02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Bad.

2862
02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:23.000
Good.

2863
02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Boom.

2864
02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:25.000
You know, I don't think he knew well.

2865
02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:26.000
I'm sure he's the dog.

2866
02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
Nonetheless, yes, I got that kettlebell.

2867
02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:29.000
There's a lot of good stuff.

2868
02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:33.000
There's these electrolyte minerals that are part of my daily daily

2869
02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:38.000
main domains with the discipline.

2870
02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
And the last going there on it.

2871
02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:43.000
Com slash jacco and check out some stuff on there.

2872
02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
Really good stuff on there.

2873
02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:46.000
All right.

2874
02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
Some books weigh the warrior kid free.

2875
02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
The book is called Where There's a Will.

2876
02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:51.000
There's a good message.

2877
02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Talk about it already.

2878
02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:53.000
Check that one out.

2879
02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
It is available now.

2880
02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:59.000
Also weigh the warrior kid at one end to marks mission is two.

2881
02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
Number one is weigh the warrior kid.

2882
02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:02.000
Check those out for your kid to teach your kid these lessons.

2883
02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:12.000
The jacan I just talked about for two plus hours are broken down, simplified and

2884
02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:16.000
and sprinkled, sprinkled throughout these books.

2885
02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:20.000
So that your kid is going to read on your kid is going to say things to you.

2886
02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
Like dad.

2887
02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:26.000
I think that might be your ego talk.

2888
02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:31.000
That's the idea of ego gets introduced in way the warrior could free.

2889
02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:34.000
That's where it gets introduced for the first time.

2890
02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:35.000
So why?

2891
02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:38.000
Because I wish somebody would have told me about my ego.

2892
02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:41.000
I wish somebody would have explained to me that I was resentful.

2893
02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
I was jealous.

2894
02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:47.000
I was whining.

2895
02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:50.000
No one did.

2896
02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:54.000
Or if my dad did, I didn't listen because I was a young punk.

2897
02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
So get those books.

2898
02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Also if you got a younger kid, you can get Mikey in the dragons as well.

2899
02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Which again, this is the thing where your kid gets taught a lesson.

2900
02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Hey, I didn't listen to my dad.

2901
02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
I didn't listen to my mom.

2902
02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
Jason didn't listen to his mom.

2903
02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Jason didn't listen to his dad.

2904
02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:22.000
I've been sitting around with a bunch of real, really squared way people, business people.

2905
02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
And we start talking about kids.

2906
02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
And then I say, hey, wait a second.

2907
02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
Who here listen to their parents?

2908
02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:31.000
No one raises their hands.

2909
02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:32.000
Very few.

2910
02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:36.000
There's the one occasional two occasional eddie hascles.

2911
02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:37.000
Whatever.

2912
02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:38.000
Yeah.

2913
02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:39.000
I always listen to my parents.

2914
02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:40.000
No, you didn't.

2915
02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:46.000
Most, most, but what happens is when they hear it from another angle, they listen to it and they go,

2916
02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
oh, okay, I understand that.

2917
02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:49.000
And they think it's cool.

2918
02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:50.000
It's Uncle Jake say it.

2919
02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:51.000
It's not my dad.

2920
02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:55.000
Because your kids want to rebel against you because they know they have to leave the nest.

2921
02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
So they got to set up some kind of a barrier.

2922
02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:01.000
So they need someone to give them advice, but that's someone be Uncle Jake.

2923
02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:05.000
Let that someone be the king in Mikey and the dragons.

2924
02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:06.000
So there you go.

2925
02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:07.000
That's that.

2926
02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:10.000
Also, we got obviously discipline and concrete.

2927
02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
Field manual.

2928
02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:16.000
If you're an adult, you need to know how to get them a path and stay on the path.

2929
02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
Get that book and put it by your bedside and read that.

2930
02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
Read a page in the morning.

2931
02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:23.000
Have you ever had a book that will get you out of bed?

2932
02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:24.000
No.

2933
02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:27.000
No. Okay, discipline. It was for your field manual. Put it next to your bed.

2934
02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:28.000
Yeah.

2935
02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
You'll be like, I'm getting out of bed.

2936
02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
I'm going to go get some.

2937
02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
So then there's extreme ownership in the economy.

2938
02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:35.000
Leadership. He's there.

2939
02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
Books about leadership.

2940
02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:38.000
Written by me in my brother, Lave.

2941
02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:39.000
Babin.

2942
02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
About the lessons that we learned overseas.

2943
02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:45.000
Now you can apply them in your team, in your business, in your life.

2944
02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Also, we got Ashlon front.

2945
02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
Leadership consultancy.

2946
02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:52.000
And we're very busy.

2947
02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:59.000
We're very busy because no matter what problem you have in your team, in your business,

2948
02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:02.000
the problem is a leadership problem.

2949
02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:07.000
And if you want to get it solved, you got to solve the leadership, the leadership problems

2950
02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:08.000
that you have.

2951
02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:12.000
And if you can do that, then you're going to solve the problems in your company.

2952
02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:13.000
So it's me.

2953
02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
It's Lave Babin.

2954
02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:16.000
J.P. D'Neill.

2955
02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:17.000
Dave Burke.

2956
02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:18.000
Flynn Cochran.

2957
02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:19.000
Mike Surrely.

2958
02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:20.000
Mike Bhima.

2959
02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Jason Gardner.

2960
02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:28.000
If you want us to help you, go to shalomfront.com for details.

2961
02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
We got the master.

2962
02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:31.000
Chicago's done.

2963
02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:32.000
Did it sell out?

2964
02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
Yes, it did.

2965
02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:35.000
How'd you like the master?

2966
02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
As your first master, Jason, how'd you like it?

2967
02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:38.000
Wow.

2968
02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:39.000
That was amazing.

2969
02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:43.000
Don't you wish you got to go to that when you were 25 years old?

2970
02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
Yeah, it was a year old.

2971
02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:48.000
I was super impressed by there were people that had their kids there.

2972
02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:49.000
Yeah.

2973
02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:50.000
Yeah.

2974
02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:51.000
That's not normal, right?

2975
02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:54.000
I mean, when you say there was people, there was probably.

2976
02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:55.000
Okay.

2977
02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:58.000
And by kids, I'm talking to them.

2978
02:46:58.000 --> 02:46:59.000
There was one 13 year old there.

2979
02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:00.000
Yeah.

2980
02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:04.000
But there was quite a few teenagers and high school age.

2981
02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:05.000
Yeah.

2982
02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:06.000
Yeah.

2983
02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
I would say 16 to 21.

2984
02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:11.000
There would be a good amount.

2985
02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:12.000
Maybe it doesn't.

2986
02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:13.000
Yeah.

2987
02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
And then, but there's the other was 113 year old.

2988
02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:18.000
The warrior kid that was just straight getting after it.

2989
02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:19.000
But that's not really the most important.

2990
02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:20.000
Yeah.

2991
02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:21.000
Yeah.

2992
02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Yeah.

2993
02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:26.000
You can imagine that warrior kid, Rauchkar, if you want to get that.

2994
02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:27.000
Yeah.

2995
02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:28.000
That's the master.

2996
02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:31.000
They always sell out the next one is in Denver.

2997
02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:35.000
It's 19th and 20th of September.

2998
02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:41.000
And it's going to sell out Sydney, Australia, December 4th and 5th.

2999
02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:42.000
It's going to sell out.

3000
02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
We got people in Australia.

3001
02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:45.000
Yes, we do.

3002
02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:49.000
When I went to Brizzy, there was people from all over Australia coming to hang out.

3003
02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:50.000
Oh, yeah.

3004
02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:54.000
Home of David Hacquire, Brisbane.

3005
02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:55.000
That's very moved.

3006
02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:56.000
Take it.

3007
02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:57.000
Yeah.

3008
02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
And if you want to come to that code, extremotorship.com.

3009
02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
Get on it early.

3010
02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:02.000
EF online.

3011
02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:06.000
If you can't come to the master or you can't bring your entire company the

3012
02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:09.000
master because the master is expensive.

3013
02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:12.000
Then get go to EF online.com.

3014
02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
And what that is, it's leadership training.

3015
02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:17.000
But the thing is leadership training is not an inoculation.

3016
02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
You can't just go to leadership training one time and then you're like, oh, cool.

3017
02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:20.000
I got extreme ownership.

3018
02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:21.000
Now I'm good to go.

3019
02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:22.000
It doesn't work like that.

3020
02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:26.000
Just like you can't go to one GJT class or even one week's worth of GJT class.

3021
02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
You can't go to a two day GJT seminar.

3022
02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:29.000
Now you're good to go.

3023
02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:30.000
No.

3024
02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:31.000
You need to keep training.

3025
02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
And that's what happens here as well.

3026
02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:36.000
So it's not an inoculation.

3027
02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
You got to get it repeatedly.

3028
02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
And that's what EF online does.

3029
02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.000
Or if you can't make it to the master.

3030
02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:48.000
Go to EF online.com and also EF Overwatch.

3031
02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:57.000
Taking proven leaders from spec ops and combat aviation and putting them in companies in the civilian sector that need leaders.

3032
02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:00.000
Now you might think, well, they don't have any experience in my industry.

3033
02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:01.000
Cool.

3034
02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:02.000
They'll learn it.

3035
02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:03.000
That's what we do.

3036
02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:08.000
Higher for their character, higher for their leadership capability and then teach them the industry specifics.

3037
02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:12.000
They'll pick up and they will fill in the leadership holes that are causing you problems.

3038
02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:22.000
And if you want to hear more about 90s TV shows or super Mario Brothers from Echo.

3039
02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:23.000
No.

3040
02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Or you want to hear more about war or leadership from Jason or me than all of us are on the interwebs.

3041
02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:35.000
Jason is on Instagram. Jason dot n dot gardener.

3042
02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
He's on Twitter.

3043
02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
Jason n Gardner.

3044
02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:42.000
He's on Facebook as well. Jason Gardner.

3045
02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:49.000
And obviously Echo and I are both on those platforms.

3046
02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:53.000
Twitter, Instagram, and that.

3047
02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:58.000
Echo's at Echo Charles and I am at Jocca Willink.

3048
02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:02.000
And thanks to all the veterans out there like Jason.

3049
02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:08.000
Who did their time on the line and thanks to everyone else out there right now in the fight.

3050
02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:11.000
And for protecting our way of life.

3051
02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:15.000
You got any other closing thoughts?

3052
02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
Nothing for the group.

3053
02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:20.000
Check.

3054
02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:27.000
And also thanks to police and law enforcement firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

3055
02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:31.000
correctional officers, border patrol, secret service and all the first responders.

3056
02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:37.000
Thank you all for keeping us safe here at home.

3057
02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:43.000
And remember that we all make mistakes.

3058
02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:47.000
But the mistakes that you can't recover from are the ones that you don't own.

3059
02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:51.000
The ones that you don't admit.

3060
02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
So step up.

3061
02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:56.000
Eggmit your mistakes and own your mistakes.

3062
02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:00.000
And then no matter what.

3063
02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:04.000
Keep getting after it.

3064
02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
And until next time.

3065
02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:10.000
This is Jason Gardner and Echo and Jocco.

3066
02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:37.000
Ow.
