[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number two, 96 with me, Jocco Willink.
[00:00:06] The Chief of Naval Operations takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Special
[00:00:12] Warfare Operator First Class, Chad M. Wilkinson, United States Navy.
[00:00:20] For service as set forth in the following citation, for conspicuous gallantry and
[00:00:28] intrapetity in action against the enemy while serving as a mission support sight team leader
[00:00:34] while assigned to a joint task force in support of operations in during the freedom on 24 April
[00:00:41] 2011.
[00:00:43] The officer Wilkinson displayed superior guidance during a daytime assault targeting a Taliban
[00:00:50] commander while under significant enemy fire.
[00:00:56] Upon arriving into the objective area, Petty Officer Wilkinson and his assault element came
[00:01:01] under a hail of enemy fire.
[00:01:06] He and his teammates led his assault to set containment on the objective area.
[00:01:13] After receiving friendly wounded in action from direct enemy fires and grenades within 20
[00:01:17] meters of the target compound, Petty Officer Wilkinson boldly exposed himself to the enemy
[00:01:24] and suppressed the incoming fire that allowed his element to move to safety and enable
[00:01:28] the combat medic to move to their positions to treat a head wound of one of his teammates.
[00:01:37] He directed two additional assaults on the target compound and coordinated with higher
[00:01:42] headquarters for three rotary wing, close air support missions after evacuating all non-combatants
[00:01:48] from adjacent buildings.
[00:01:53] Petty Officer Wilkinson's actions eliminated the enemy combatants, enabled the evacuation
[00:01:58] of the wounded casualties and allowed for the safe extraction of the assault force.
[00:02:06] By his bold leadership courageous actions and total dedication to duty, Petty Officer Wilkinson
[00:02:13] reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the United States
[00:02:19] Naval Service for the President Jonathan W. Greenert Admiral United States Navy chief of
[00:02:31] naval operations.
[00:02:38] So there you have the award citation of a hero from one of our recent wars.
[00:02:52] Afghanistan.
[00:02:55] And war is in some ways timeless.
[00:03:02] There are heroes, there are sacrifices, and there's fear and pain and loss.
[00:03:16] And war also evolves over time and there's new weapons, new technology, new tactics,
[00:03:24] there's lessons that are learned, there's solutions that are created with the advent of
[00:03:35] poison gas.
[00:03:36] World War I came the advent of the gas mask.
[00:03:41] From the creation of machine guns came the creation of the tank.
[00:03:48] Was responsible for the creation or the advancement of radios and radar and atomic weapons
[00:03:56] and energy and jet engines and electric computers and war creates problems.
[00:04:03] I think create solutions to those problems.
[00:04:10] Or at least it's supposed to.
[00:04:18] There've been great advances in medicine from war.
[00:04:25] The Civil War in America brought about the significant use of anesthesia.
[00:04:34] The World War I men were now being gravely wounded by these newly developed machine guns
[00:04:40] and they were losing massive quantities of blood.
[00:04:42] And so doctors started regularly using blood transfusions for the first time.
[00:04:49] World War II saw the expanded use of antibiotics to fight off infections.
[00:04:59] World War II's also where they started using metal plates to repair broken bones and fractures
[00:05:05] from these explosions, from these new weapons.
[00:05:08] And the Korean War helped advance the idea of life flights.
[00:05:14] Then using helicopters to get wounded soldiers the care that they needed is quickly
[00:05:18] as possible.
[00:05:24] And the Vietnam War started using Nae Palm regularly.
[00:05:32] Not brought about advances in burn care.
[00:05:36] And they started using antiseptic and antibiotic infused the dressings to reduce infection.
[00:05:45] So war creates new forms of physical trauma and then creates ways to help ease that trauma.
[00:06:02] And then there's unseen trauma.
[00:06:07] And the conclusive blasts, the traumatic stress every war has its own form.
[00:06:19] And World War I, it was shell shock.
[00:06:22] And the horror of going over the top.
[00:06:28] World War II, the dreadfulness of close killing.
[00:06:33] The Vietnam, the confusion over who's good and who's bad.
[00:06:41] In our current modern wars, there's something else to contend with for our professional
[00:06:49] warriors.
[00:06:53] And that is the idea of an unending war.
[00:06:59] Because World War I, as heinous and awful as it was, was also finite.
[00:07:09] World War II is similar.
[00:07:11] I mean absolute horror, yes.
[00:07:14] But a horror that ended in four years.
[00:07:21] Korean War lasted three years.
[00:07:22] Korean War is also where we started to see this idea of tours where soldiers would go over
[00:07:29] and do a tour.
[00:07:32] And then go home.
[00:07:36] And that was it.
[00:07:38] And the same thing in Vietnam.
[00:07:41] We all kind of know that story.
[00:07:43] Service members were required to do their hitch.
[00:07:45] And now.
[00:07:49] One year, count the days.
[00:07:57] And in all those cases, for a majority of soldiers, war was a finite thing.
[00:08:04] Yes, brutal, yes, horrific, yes, sickening.
[00:08:12] But had an endpoint.
[00:08:18] So many of this generation, our current generation, there's been no endpoint insight.
[00:08:29] It's been a constant exposure to violence, conclusive explosions, stress, deployment after
[00:08:41] deployment after deployment after deployment.
[00:08:46] And the training is elevated to, and that's repetitive over and over and over again.
[00:08:52] Explosive breaching of doors, firing rockets over and over again, improvised demolition shots,
[00:08:59] and then back on deployment again.
[00:09:09] And that can become a never-ending cycle of trauma.
[00:09:22] And that's taken its toll on the mental health of some of our nation's finest warriors.
[00:09:36] And like, Chad Wilkinson, who received that silver star and who finally met his end,
[00:09:47] not on the battlefield by the hands of the enemy.
[00:09:55] Who sadly took his own life with suicide.
[00:10:12] And we have to learn from that.
[00:10:17] And here today to talk to us about Chad, and what he went through is his wife.
[00:10:25] Sarah Wilkinson, and joining her as Jason McCarthy, former Special Forces soldier, founder
[00:10:32] of Go Rock, and a friend of Sarah's.
[00:10:36] And together, they had been trying to share the message of mental health, remove the
[00:10:40] stigma's raise awareness, and encourage people to reach out if they need help.
[00:10:49] And encourage us all to help each other.
[00:10:56] With that, Sarah, Jason.
[00:10:58] Thank you for joining us.
[00:10:59] Thank you.
[00:11:00] Good to see you guys again.
[00:11:03] Yeah, Jason came on before.
[00:11:05] You're on podcast 208 talking about your experiences in the Special Forces, in Florida,
[00:11:12] tennis champion.
[00:11:14] Almost championed.
[00:11:15] My mom was the dad of the mental growth champion.
[00:11:19] And Sarah, thank you so much for coming out.
[00:11:21] It's very, very awesome to meet you.
[00:11:24] And I just want to, you know, get right into your story and the story of you and Chad.
[00:11:29] And let's start at the beginning.
[00:11:31] Where you from, where'd you grow up, how did it all start?
[00:11:35] I'm a military kid born, born, bread.
[00:11:39] My dad was marine.
[00:11:40] I'm the youngest of two.
[00:11:42] I have an older sister.
[00:11:44] My mom and dad met pretty young and got married.
[00:11:47] My dad joined the military, became a marine, and set off their path to move around every
[00:11:52] couple of years.
[00:11:54] Was he from a military family?
[00:11:55] No.
[00:11:56] He's randomly joined the Marine Corps.
[00:11:59] Uh, yeah, it was kind of like right where he just missed the draft.
[00:12:03] But yet, still felt the need to serve, I guess.
[00:12:07] He, they come from a small town in Ohio, where everyone kind of just stays in that same
[00:12:12] town.
[00:12:13] I think he wanted to find something bigger, maybe more challenging.
[00:12:17] I can relate.
[00:12:18] He wanted to serve his country.
[00:12:20] So yeah, his marine, I was a military kid, moved around all the time.
[00:12:25] My dad was an officer, so that means we moved every two to three years.
[00:12:30] We spent most of the time on the East Coast.
[00:12:32] We lived once overseas in Okinawa.
[00:12:36] And yeah, I, I mean, I went to 15 schools before I graduated.
[00:12:42] So do you become super adaptable when you go to 15 schools?
[00:12:46] I guess you could either come super adaptable or just super in a shell and not talk to
[00:12:51] anybody.
[00:12:52] I, I really think you could go either way.
[00:12:53] You're either out there or you're, or you're rigid.
[00:12:56] I consider myself more like a chameleon because of that.
[00:12:59] So I can blend in in a room where I can stand out what needs to happen.
[00:13:04] So growing up moving all the time, I mean, I went to a different school fifth, sixth,
[00:13:09] seventh, eighth, ninth grade, different school each year for those years.
[00:13:16] So yeah.
[00:13:17] And then, and so then what about Chad?
[00:13:18] When did you meet Chad?
[00:13:20] First day of high school.
[00:13:21] And where was this?
[00:13:22] A quannico Virginia.
[00:13:24] So so my dad marine, right quannico's marine corpace.
[00:13:28] And his dad was Navy.
[00:13:30] His dad was a former seal.
[00:13:32] His uncle was also a seal.
[00:13:34] So he always wanted to be a seal from the time he was like 12.
[00:13:39] But his dad had switched rates.
[00:13:41] And then was kind of on the helicopter duty with the president.
[00:13:46] And so that's what brought him to quannico.
[00:13:50] Because otherwise, I don't think we would have mad.
[00:13:52] He would have never been there.
[00:13:54] Yeah, we went to a really, really small school.
[00:13:57] It's a DOD high school.
[00:13:58] It doesn't exist anymore.
[00:14:00] So a high school that's on base that's just for the military kids.
[00:14:04] Our kids well behaved on the military school, on the military base school.
[00:14:08] Well, when I went, yes, because, you know, we're talking early 90s.
[00:14:12] But also on base, not on quannico when I moved to Lysun, this was the case.
[00:14:17] But a lot of times you would have a plaque in front of your house.
[00:14:20] So my house said there's a plaque that's at Colonel Trilice, out in front of her house.
[00:14:24] So you can really do too much because not only, you know, could they report to your dad.
[00:14:29] They knew where you live.
[00:14:30] So you're in a controlled environment.
[00:14:32] Pretty much, yeah.
[00:14:33] What kind of music were you listening to?
[00:14:36] Like grunge, you know, poppy type of music.
[00:14:39] Because what year is this?
[00:14:41] Well, when I met him, it was 91.
[00:14:43] So you're a freshman in high school in 91.
[00:14:47] Yeah, so it was kind of peak grunge.
[00:14:49] Yeah.
[00:14:49] You were just getting your Nirvana.
[00:14:51] Oh, yeah.
[00:14:51] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:14:52] He loved Pearl.
[00:14:53] Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:54] Yeah.
[00:14:55] I still listen to it and just smile.
[00:14:58] So you guys meet and what?
[00:15:00] It was a love at first sight.
[00:15:01] Is there?
[00:15:02] For me?
[00:15:03] Oh, yeah.
[00:15:04] I mean, I don't know about him.
[00:15:07] Yeah, he, we, so go into a military school right off the bat the first day.
[00:15:13] There starts to be buzz about who the new kids are, who's this kid and this kid at
[00:15:16] the school is so, so small.
[00:15:18] And they were talking about the Wilkinson brothers.
[00:15:20] The girls were like, have you seen the Wilkinson brothers?
[00:15:23] I was like, what's the deal?
[00:15:25] But I smile because I just remember this so clearly sitting in the bleachers on the
[00:15:31] first day, traditional like PE coach just like intense colon roll and this kid was sitting
[00:15:38] in front of me.
[00:15:39] I saw the back of his head and they called Chad Wilkinson and he turned his head to the
[00:15:42] side and he said, here.
[00:15:44] And I was like, oh, well, I'm done.
[00:15:46] I like him.
[00:15:47] And that was it.
[00:15:48] How did you connect then?
[00:15:50] Well, I mean, a small school, we kind of, you, you just end being military kids.
[00:15:54] I think it was pretty natural for all of us to just be friends.
[00:15:58] There really wasn't like a cool group and a not cool group.
[00:16:03] Everybody, you were kind of forced to be friends with everybody because the school was so
[00:16:07] small and we got so small.
[00:16:08] How many people per grade?
[00:16:10] His graduating class was 24.
[00:16:11] I think.
[00:16:12] Oh, 24.
[00:16:13] That is really small.
[00:16:14] Yeah.
[00:16:15] Yeah.
[00:16:16] And so.
[00:16:17] That's like one classroom.
[00:16:18] Yeah.
[00:16:19] Yeah.
[00:16:20] We actually, the school was a middle school in high school together.
[00:16:23] It was just in a different hall.
[00:16:24] So high school took up like one hall and a half and the middle school took up like another
[00:16:29] hall and a half.
[00:16:30] And we didn't cross paths with the middle schoolers, but we were all in the same building.
[00:16:34] Now, were you guys in the same grade?
[00:16:36] Was he a freshman year freshman?
[00:16:37] No, he was just, he was a year older, sophomore.
[00:16:39] He was a sophomore.
[00:16:40] I was, yeah.
[00:16:41] And so then, like, what did he like say what's up, sister?
[00:16:47] I mean, what did he do?
[00:16:48] How do you roll?
[00:16:49] How did he just happen?
[00:16:50] He was pretty cool.
[00:16:51] I mean, I say there wasn't a cool group, but he was, I think he was pretty cool
[00:16:54] in high school and he was super athletic.
[00:16:56] And, I mean, for anybody who's listening, he's really good looking.
[00:17:01] So, you know, he had that going for him.
[00:17:04] We were just friends the first year or two.
[00:17:07] What sports did he play?
[00:17:09] Soccer, primarily.
[00:17:12] I think he was on the golf team one year.
[00:17:14] And I think he was the kicker for the football team one year because they just knew
[00:17:19] he could kick it.
[00:17:20] So he'd run out there, kick and then come off.
[00:17:24] But yeah, for two years, we were more or less just friends.
[00:17:27] I mean, in that period of time, he did ask me to go to homecoming.
[00:17:32] And I was super pumped about it.
[00:17:35] So homecoming is what?
[00:17:39] Like, yeah.
[00:17:40] The thing is, I went to a really small school too.
[00:17:42] I think I had 80 people in my graduating.
[00:17:44] I don't really remember the home.
[00:17:45] I know my, because I have kids too.
[00:17:48] And my daughters went to some kind of homecoming.
[00:17:49] But what's the deal with homecoming?
[00:17:51] I know the team came to my house.
[00:17:53] They were dressed up.
[00:17:54] The boys were wearing ties and like this tucking part.
[00:17:56] Yeah, it's basically a reason to get dressed up and have a party.
[00:17:59] And you know, back then it was big deal because it's a small school.
[00:18:02] And you have a huge pepper alley on Friday.
[00:18:04] And that was rally.
[00:18:05] Yeah.
[00:18:06] And we were pumped.
[00:18:07] I mean, my kids dread pepper alley is now they're like, that's lame.
[00:18:09] I'm not going.
[00:18:10] I'm like, why not?
[00:18:11] It's awesome.
[00:18:12] That's what we did.
[00:18:13] There was a football game.
[00:18:14] And then after the football game, you had a dance.
[00:18:18] And you get dressed up.
[00:18:19] And you got the like corsage and the flower and the whole thing.
[00:18:23] Yeah.
[00:18:24] It's a different time.
[00:18:26] You know, I was looking at a boot camp, a picture of myself the other day.
[00:18:31] And the picture was taken in 1990, right?
[00:18:35] So I posted, I was like, I posted on my social media page.
[00:18:39] Right?
[00:18:40] Hey, you know, here's a new boot camp.
[00:18:41] And I thought, so that's 1990.
[00:18:44] That's 31 years ago.
[00:18:48] That means when I was in boot camp, if I would have looked at a picture that was
[00:18:53] 31 years old, it would have been from 1960.
[00:18:56] Yeah.
[00:18:57] Crazy.
[00:18:58] And then I have sometimes on the podcast, I'll have guys on that run, you know, World
[00:19:04] World 2 career Vietnam, but recently had a bunch of Vietnam guys on.
[00:19:07] And they're just like, they're talking about pepper rallies.
[00:19:10] Like these kind of things.
[00:19:11] It was just a different time.
[00:19:13] I think you caught the end of it.
[00:19:14] I caught the tail end of it.
[00:19:15] I think I did.
[00:19:16] I think I found like the sweet spot of high school before all that.
[00:19:20] I was blew up and diminished.
[00:19:23] I don't know.
[00:19:24] Okay, so you get started to sidetrack.
[00:19:27] I kind of needed to know about homecomings.
[00:19:29] Because my two daughters went to home, the homecoming thing.
[00:19:32] They got picked up by some dudes at the house.
[00:19:35] The guys were wearing ties and whatnot.
[00:19:39] I tracked it, no one.
[00:19:40] We're good.
[00:19:44] Okay, so you get asked the homecoming, my Chad?
[00:19:46] Yeah.
[00:19:47] And it was just the dance and then later.
[00:19:52] Well, so we asked me after we got in a food fight in the cafeteria.
[00:19:57] Where you got in a food fight?
[00:19:58] No, he got in a food fight.
[00:19:59] Okay.
[00:20:00] He's great.
[00:20:01] And he came up, he had food on a shirt and stuff.
[00:20:05] And then he's like, hey, as he would say, you want to go to homecoming with me?
[00:20:09] I tried to act not really excited, but I was like, all right.
[00:20:12] It was like, yes.
[00:20:13] Score.
[00:20:14] So yeah, and we just went homecoming.
[00:20:16] And then that was that.
[00:20:17] We didn't date or anything.
[00:20:18] And then fast forward to the following spring.
[00:20:22] One more thing about homecoming and dances in high school was their particular like songs
[00:20:29] that were repetitive.
[00:20:31] Because when I went to high school, every single dance that I went through, which started
[00:20:36] in mid-School, which was, I guess, it was 7th, so 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade.
[00:20:42] Every single dance that I went to.
[00:20:45] That's where we had dances, I don't know what they're called now.
[00:20:47] But every single dance we went to, every single one.
[00:20:50] So there's probably 4 or 5 a year, you know, 6 or 30 times.
[00:20:54] The song that would play at the end of the night was, was, stay where it had a Led Zeppelin.
[00:20:59] Oh, yeah.
[00:21:00] Is that a normal transition?
[00:21:01] Is that a worldwide tradition?
[00:21:03] I think it's just a really good march-out song.
[00:21:05] They're like, yeah, beat it.
[00:21:08] Lights are coming up.
[00:21:09] Mozy out the door.
[00:21:11] Right on.
[00:21:12] Right on.
[00:21:13] So you go to this dance and I cut you off.
[00:21:16] So you go to the dance and that was it.
[00:21:18] Nothing really became of it.
[00:21:20] But then fast forward a couple of months later, towards the end of the year, he would go
[00:21:25] by me in the locker.
[00:21:26] You know, I'd be see him in the locker and he'd walk by and he just, hey, the whole, hey.
[00:21:30] And I just, I kind of just did the whole girl flip out thing.
[00:21:34] Like, oh my god, he said, hey to me.
[00:21:37] And then he needed help with a history paper, apparently.
[00:21:39] They asked me to help.
[00:21:40] They asked me to help.
[00:21:41] Yeah.
[00:21:42] So I was like, okay, and then he asked me out to dinner.
[00:21:46] I went to dinner and we started dating pretty much.
[00:21:48] So that was-
[00:21:49] Where'd you go to dinner?
[00:21:50] We went to this Mexican restaurant.
[00:21:51] I don't think it even exists anymore.
[00:21:53] I don't know the name of it.
[00:21:54] And a quiet harbor.
[00:21:55] We'll shout out.
[00:21:56] I don't know if I actually asked a girl to dinner until I was in my twigs.
[00:22:01] Who are you at class?
[00:22:04] Well, I don't even know if I should share all this.
[00:22:07] But we actually also went to a movie.
[00:22:09] And we bought tickets to some stupid movie because we couldn't get in a radar movie.
[00:22:13] And then we snuck into the movie, sliver.
[00:22:17] Do you guys remember that movie?
[00:22:18] Harbor movie?
[00:22:19] It's like sexy smutnik.
[00:22:20] Oh, oh.
[00:22:21] And I'm like, on this date, now I was like, oh, there's a lot of artists sharing stone.
[00:22:26] I, oh, I think so.
[00:22:28] I actually don't remember who was in it.
[00:22:30] I mean, this was a long long time ago, but I just remember being like completely red.
[00:22:35] Thankfully, in a dark movie theater.
[00:22:37] And Marist.
[00:22:38] Yeah, but we did.
[00:22:39] But dinner and snuck in a red at our movie.
[00:22:41] Crazy.
[00:22:42] Crazy kid.
[00:22:43] Kids were getting crazy.
[00:22:44] I know.
[00:22:45] That's what you was at.
[00:22:46] Was this one his senior year?
[00:22:48] I was, it was the end of my sophomore year.
[00:22:51] His junior year.
[00:22:52] Okay.
[00:22:53] And so this was 1993.
[00:22:54] Okay.
[00:22:55] Really started dating.
[00:22:57] So now you're legit dating.
[00:22:58] Yeah.
[00:22:59] Through the summer?
[00:23:01] Well, so then I was coming in the fall.
[00:23:03] Yeah.
[00:23:04] Well, then it was for us.
[00:23:05] I don't know if it changes.
[00:23:06] But it was like October.
[00:23:08] I have a really great picture from that day.
[00:23:10] I should pass it to you just because it's good.
[00:23:12] But no, my dad got stationed in Lajoon.
[00:23:18] So I had to leave after my sophomore year.
[00:23:20] Yeah.
[00:23:21] And that was the only time I was ever really pissed, honestly.
[00:23:25] Every move I'd be like, okay.
[00:23:27] We didn't get family vacations.
[00:23:28] We moved.
[00:23:29] That's what happened.
[00:23:30] And then you're on a new adventure.
[00:23:32] And this was the only time I was mad.
[00:23:33] And so.
[00:23:34] What were you into for?
[00:23:35] Were you doing sports as well?
[00:23:36] I was.
[00:23:37] I was a swimmer.
[00:23:38] I was a swimmer.
[00:23:39] Cool.
[00:23:40] Yeah.
[00:23:41] So I was that person and it's like, you wake up at five.
[00:23:42] You swim.
[00:23:43] You go to school.
[00:23:44] You swim.
[00:23:45] You swim a lot.
[00:23:46] Yeah.
[00:23:47] Okay.
[00:23:48] So now you have to go to Camp Lajoon.
[00:23:49] Yeah.
[00:23:50] So I managed to work a deal.
[00:23:53] And I stayed at my best friends house.
[00:23:56] Steph cutty.
[00:23:58] So I could hang out with her.
[00:23:59] But really, so I could hang out with Chad.
[00:24:02] Let's be honest.
[00:24:03] I want to already.
[00:24:04] And yeah, I just hung out that summer as a lifeguard.
[00:24:07] I got the pool on base through high school as a lifeguard.
[00:24:10] And I pulled butts at the shooting range.
[00:24:12] Dang.
[00:24:13] You know, like, rolling up.
[00:24:14] And we, all the high school kids, we just sit there like in this little dugout with
[00:24:18] your pro on and you'd see the bullet go and you pull the target, slap the sticker on it,
[00:24:25] throw it back up.
[00:24:26] It's how we spent our weekends.
[00:24:27] Minimum wage?
[00:24:28] Oh, yeah.
[00:24:29] I was barely making anything.
[00:24:30] Well, I mean, I was actually in the Navy.
[00:24:32] And I did that.
[00:24:33] But I did have for each other.
[00:24:34] That's what we did.
[00:24:35] Well, I have.
[00:24:37] So people to come down and do it for us.
[00:24:39] I guess that's some wrinkle or officer thing.
[00:24:41] Well, our friends dad pretty much ran the rain.
[00:24:43] So I think he just like, I'm going to make these kids do something.
[00:24:46] And so we could hang out with our friends all day on the weekend.
[00:24:49] It makes me sound like such a nerd.
[00:24:50] Not that I'm saying this.
[00:24:51] I didn't do anything like super crazy in high school.
[00:24:53] But we could hang out with our friends and get paid a little bit of money.
[00:24:57] Okay.
[00:24:58] So that's where you spend the summer and this whole time you're hanging out with Chad.
[00:25:01] So you guys are a tight, getting tight at this time or a thing.
[00:25:05] But you're going to bail.
[00:25:06] Yeah.
[00:25:07] I'm just ticking.
[00:25:08] And yep, so I moved to Lajoon.
[00:25:10] We continued dating.
[00:25:12] I'm a junior.
[00:25:13] He's a senior.
[00:25:15] And he would drive down on the weekends.
[00:25:17] Which was kind of a big deal because you know, he was fairly newly licensed, you know,
[00:25:22] and his mom and dad would let him drive.
[00:25:24] The minivan or what was he driving?
[00:25:26] No, he had an old oldsmoble.
[00:25:29] I think at my time, it belonged to his grandpa.
[00:25:31] And like the front seat was busted.
[00:25:34] So it like sat crooked.
[00:25:36] And he was a hoopty.
[00:25:37] It was great.
[00:25:38] And he would drive that down on the weekends and see me and then drive back.
[00:25:42] Not every weekend, but as much as he could.
[00:25:45] Stay the night.
[00:25:46] Mm-hmm.
[00:25:47] Parents were cool.
[00:25:48] Yeah.
[00:25:49] This was like a thing because my parents, my mom said to me recently, like in the last year,
[00:25:53] we had some conversations just about this, Chad and I are youth.
[00:25:57] And she said, I don't know what it was.
[00:25:59] I just, we just always knew that the relationship with you and Chad was just something
[00:26:05] different.
[00:26:06] And he stayed.
[00:26:07] I mean, he stayed in the separate room.
[00:26:09] He wasn't my room, but yeah.
[00:26:10] Well, at least as far as the birds know.
[00:26:13] I mean, yeah.
[00:26:14] He was getting tactical.
[00:26:19] I'm sure at some point.
[00:26:21] I am.
[00:26:22] You're playing the fair thing.
[00:26:24] Cool.
[00:26:26] So then how long does this long distance relationship work?
[00:26:30] So we, and so we date and then when I, so he graduates, an homiceneer.
[00:26:35] So I'm a senior.
[00:26:37] He graduates high school.
[00:26:38] His mom and dad moved to Florida to Orlando now.
[00:26:43] When he's in high school, is he talking about joining the Navy?
[00:26:45] Has he talked about going in the dreams?
[00:26:47] He always kind of, I think he just always knew that's what he was going to do.
[00:26:52] It wasn't that he talked about it in excess.
[00:26:54] So he has two brothers.
[00:26:55] He's the oldest.
[00:26:56] Two brothers in the necister.
[00:26:58] And his house was just full of, you know, every classic, seal movie.
[00:27:05] You know, speck up movie, you know, he had posters on his wall, which I think I still
[00:27:12] have that you probably can't even find anywhere anymore.
[00:27:15] But I think it was just something he always knew that's what he was going to do.
[00:27:19] I don't ever remember him talking about anything else.
[00:27:22] Like, oh, I might go to business school or something.
[00:27:26] No.
[00:27:27] It was so obvious to him and you that it was not even really a big subject.
[00:27:31] It was like, yeah, well, what else am I going to do?
[00:27:33] That type of thing?
[00:27:34] Yeah.
[00:27:35] And I mean, even then, I don't think at my age, I was even thinking about, you know,
[00:27:41] our life together.
[00:27:42] Like, oh, I'm going to marry him.
[00:27:44] I doodle this name a lot on all my notebooks because that's what you do.
[00:27:47] And I am his, your grunge t-shirt and your boy crush.
[00:27:50] But I just always thought, I'm just going to be wherever he is.
[00:27:56] You know, I wasn't thinking like marriage, but I just knew whatever he is is where I want
[00:28:01] to be.
[00:28:02] Right on.
[00:28:03] So what happens?
[00:28:04] Oh, we break up.
[00:28:05] So that kind of.
[00:28:06] Yeah.
[00:28:07] So we broke up.
[00:28:08] Oh, this is your senior year.
[00:28:09] My senior year.
[00:28:10] So he's going.
[00:28:11] Yeah, so he moved down to Florida.
[00:28:13] And so the deal was, is he wanted to be an officer.
[00:28:18] And at that time, so he enrolled in the University of Central Florida.
[00:28:23] His mom and dad are in Orlando.
[00:28:25] He's down there with them.
[00:28:26] He's thinking, I'm going to go to college.
[00:28:28] I'm going to get a four year degree and then I'm going to go do the whole Navy, Buds
[00:28:32] Deal.
[00:28:33] But they were saying, hey, we're not really taking officers right now because we just
[00:28:37] don't need them.
[00:28:38] So you can go get your degree, but it's not that's not going to work out.
[00:28:42] And so basically a year in college, he said, OK, I'm out and joined.
[00:28:51] So we broke up my senior year.
[00:28:55] Did you break up before or after he joined the Navy before?
[00:28:58] So before he's in Orlando, I'm in Luzune.
[00:29:01] We break up.
[00:29:02] Really, just because I think you got friends are like, why are you dating some boy that
[00:29:07] looks so far away?
[00:29:08] That's stupid.
[00:29:10] All the things.
[00:29:11] So we broke up.
[00:29:13] And we spent two and a half years pretty much went by in that time.
[00:29:19] The time he was in college and my senior year.
[00:29:24] And then my first year after graduating high school, we just didn't really speak to each
[00:29:30] other.
[00:29:31] And this was before cell phones or social media.
[00:29:35] You can't properly cyber stalk somebody back in the day.
[00:29:39] Right.
[00:29:40] And I would stay in touch with his sister, his little sister.
[00:29:43] So she's 10 years younger than him.
[00:29:46] She was pretty young.
[00:29:47] I mean, I don't know when she was five.
[00:29:48] So she's pretty young.
[00:29:50] But.
[00:29:51] And so I always kind of knew what he was doing.
[00:29:53] And I knew he joined the Navy and you know, went to boot camp and was going to buds.
[00:29:57] And I really wanted to be there for his graduation of buds.
[00:30:03] But I thought that might be weird if I just show up.
[00:30:08] Plus I'd never been a California, the whole thing.
[00:30:10] I'm living.
[00:30:11] I'm going to confirm that would be weird.
[00:30:13] Yeah.
[00:30:14] Yeah.
[00:30:15] And so during this time, you know, he goes to college, joins the military.
[00:30:19] I finish high school.
[00:30:20] My family moves to Tampa because my dad is at St. Com.
[00:30:24] So his family is Orlando, my family is in Tampa.
[00:30:28] I'm going to community college.
[00:30:31] And I think I want to be there for his buds graduation.
[00:30:33] But I can't do that.
[00:30:34] So I need to put myself in a position that doesn't allow me to do that.
[00:30:37] So I went on a cruise.
[00:30:38] And I thought if I'm on a boat, I can't get off the boat.
[00:30:42] And I'm like 19 or something.
[00:30:44] And we doted and we doted in New Orleans.
[00:30:46] And I told my girlfriend, I was like, I'm getting off the boat.
[00:30:49] I'm going to go get on a plane.
[00:30:50] And I'm just going to show up there.
[00:30:52] And she's like, OK.
[00:30:53] And I realize it didn't have any money to get there.
[00:30:56] I'd spend it all in the cruise.
[00:30:57] And were you, but you hadn't been communicating with him?
[00:31:00] No, during this time period.
[00:31:01] No, just keep an in touch with a sister.
[00:31:03] And like his mom would check in from time to time.
[00:31:05] And his mom still liked you.
[00:31:07] Yeah, I hope.
[00:31:09] You know?
[00:31:10] So yeah.
[00:31:11] So then he graduates buds.
[00:31:13] So he graduates buds.
[00:31:14] And now what happens?
[00:31:15] Well, I knew he graduated buds.
[00:31:18] And then I also knew he was coming back to Orlando.
[00:31:20] So I took a couple days off work and just waited.
[00:31:25] And then he called and said, hey, I'd really like to see you.
[00:31:28] And I was like, oh, that's cool.
[00:31:31] Let me see if I can get off work.
[00:31:34] You know, you got to play tough.
[00:31:35] And yeah, I didn't drove there.
[00:31:39] Was super nervous.
[00:31:41] His brother, I think, opened the door.
[00:31:43] He was wrestling his other brother in the background,
[00:31:46] probably trying to play it cool.
[00:31:47] And pretty much the same thing as that day on the bleachers.
[00:31:50] And now as soon as I saw him, I was like, man.
[00:31:54] So he had graduated buds at that point.
[00:31:58] So now he must be on orders got orders to a team.
[00:32:00] Yeah.
[00:32:01] So he had to go.
[00:32:03] This is when they were had specific rates.
[00:32:07] Your time for him, probably too.
[00:32:08] So he went to the medics school.
[00:32:10] Oh, so yeah.
[00:32:11] So actually, so he what he got was he must have been a corpsman.
[00:32:14] And then they would take corpsman and after buds,
[00:32:16] they would take corpsman and send him to 18 delta,
[00:32:20] the special forces medics school.
[00:32:23] What's interesting about that?
[00:32:24] And I might mess this up a little bit.
[00:32:26] But his dad then had orders to Fort Bragg
[00:32:31] and his dad ran that school.
[00:32:33] So he went through the school that his dad was running.
[00:32:37] That's interesting.
[00:32:38] That's awesome.
[00:32:39] I guess he got some good grades.
[00:32:41] Hopefully.
[00:32:41] Yeah.
[00:32:42] He's a smart guy.
[00:32:43] It's good in school.
[00:32:45] So so so then what happens?
[00:32:47] So then he's going to that school.
[00:32:49] Now are you two back together?
[00:32:50] Is this like we're back?
[00:32:51] We're back.
[00:32:52] Yeah.
[00:32:53] So we're back together.
[00:32:54] And this is I had 96.
[00:32:57] And so I decide because I want to be wherever he is,
[00:33:00] I'm going to go to college at Methodist,
[00:33:02] which is a really small school in Fayville.
[00:33:05] So I go up there for semester.
[00:33:07] I had to do a whole presentation of my dad,
[00:33:09] my dad, right, Colonel Marine Corps.
[00:33:11] He always says when you want to do something
[00:33:12] you've got every ducks lined up and come to me.
[00:33:14] And I did like a report and figured out how much it was cost.
[00:33:17] I got scholarships.
[00:33:18] I got different things.
[00:33:20] How much it would be paid for?
[00:33:22] Really because I just wanted to be closer to Chad.
[00:33:26] Was that part of the briefing or not?
[00:33:28] I think he probably understood that.
[00:33:30] But I lasted one semester.
[00:33:32] I hated it.
[00:33:33] And I left.
[00:33:33] I went back to Florida.
[00:33:35] So he did the medical school.
[00:33:36] And then he was off to Silti Mait.
[00:33:38] And then what?
[00:33:38] Once he got to Silti Mait,
[00:33:40] did you guys reconnect again?
[00:33:41] Well, so we are dating long distance now.
[00:33:46] He's at teammate down in Florida.
[00:33:49] And then I end up going to the University of Florida.
[00:33:52] And we're thinking, OK, I'm going to do college down here.
[00:33:56] You're going to do that.
[00:33:56] And then we break up again.
[00:33:58] Yeah.
[00:33:59] So two pretty big breakups.
[00:34:02] It's hard to check into a team and have a girlfriend,
[00:34:07] or whatever, no offense to girlfriends of the world.
[00:34:10] You get to a team that is like you are going down.
[00:34:12] You are a, when you're a young new team guy,
[00:34:15] you have so much on your mind as far as work goes,
[00:34:19] it's like, hey, I don't have time for anything else right now.
[00:34:23] And I don't know.
[00:34:24] That's probably has at least a little something to do with it.
[00:34:27] You're down in Florida.
[00:34:28] He's up there, like, wanting to make sure he's
[00:34:30] good to go for this.
[00:34:30] And that.
[00:34:31] Yeah.
[00:34:32] Just had, I mean, he would drive down still on the weekends.
[00:34:35] Oh, we're still dating.
[00:34:35] We're still dating.
[00:34:36] Yeah.
[00:34:37] Like that gets full credit.
[00:34:38] Yeah.
[00:34:38] And, um, but yeah, we broke up.
[00:34:41] And that was just terrible because I really thought
[00:34:46] that that was probably it.
[00:34:47] I thought I probably lost him forever.
[00:34:51] And then how long are you guys broken up for?
[00:34:54] Ah, trying to think of the timeline.
[00:34:56] I was probably like a year, year and a half.
[00:35:00] Something like that.
[00:35:00] Did he do, did he do his first deployment?
[00:35:02] Yeah.
[00:35:03] He did a deployment of his on the enterprise.
[00:35:06] He was on a ship.
[00:35:07] Only a time he was on a ship at that time.
[00:35:08] And what you was that?
[00:35:11] Um, probably 97 or 8.
[00:35:16] Okay.
[00:35:17] Somewhere in that.
[00:35:18] Right on.
[00:35:19] Yeah.
[00:35:20] So he's, he does a deployment.
[00:35:22] He's a medic.
[00:35:23] Yep.
[00:35:24] You guys are broken up.
[00:35:25] You're going to, you're going to college in Florida.
[00:35:28] Yeah.
[00:35:29] And I'm still hearing in touch with his sister.
[00:35:32] And we had, you know, we had email.
[00:35:36] So, you know, like the dial-up.
[00:35:38] I would do the dial-up email and check to see if you'd ever email me.
[00:35:43] And then all of a sudden one day he did.
[00:35:45] And he just said, I just, I told the guys, I keep thinking about you.
[00:35:49] And I want to see you.
[00:35:50] I was like, yes.
[00:35:52] So.
[00:35:53] So did he say come up to Virginia Beach and he comes down to Florida?
[00:35:55] No.
[00:35:56] I said, you know where I live?
[00:35:59] Well, first of all, he was still in deployment.
[00:36:00] He was quite home yet.
[00:36:02] And so I didn't know.
[00:36:03] And I'm in college.
[00:36:04] And yeah, he drove down and showed up at my doorstep.
[00:36:09] And I did the same thing.
[00:36:11] I did in high school.
[00:36:12] I just couldn't believe he was there, you know?
[00:36:16] And just excited.
[00:36:19] And we said to each other, I said to him before he comes, came down.
[00:36:24] If we see each other again, we're going to know.
[00:36:26] Like this is either going to be forever or it's just not.
[00:36:30] And he came down.
[00:36:32] And pretty much roll over herself when I went to Orlando and he asked me to stay
[00:36:36] in extra day.
[00:36:37] I said, do you think you could stay in extra day?
[00:36:40] And that was it.
[00:36:41] So that was the summer of 99, I think.
[00:36:49] May of 99.
[00:36:50] How old are you at this point?
[00:36:51] You're going to make me do bath.
[00:36:53] I don't know.
[00:36:54] I'm like, 29.
[00:36:55] So you're, oh yeah, you're in college.
[00:36:57] You're a young college girl.
[00:37:00] And he's swoops in.
[00:37:03] Yeah.
[00:37:04] And says, all right, we're going to do this.
[00:37:07] Yeah, I mean, did you drop out of college?
[00:37:09] So what'd you do?
[00:37:10] No, I stayed in college.
[00:37:12] You're slightly more responsible than that.
[00:37:13] Yeah, stayed in college.
[00:37:18] We, we got engaged that summer in July.
[00:37:21] We got married on paper as a lot of military people do.
[00:37:26] We've got married up in Virginia Beach
[00:37:29] in the, in the sky's backyard.
[00:37:31] And so we were at least married and had all that.
[00:37:35] And I spent time down in Florida.
[00:37:39] And then I worked it to graduate.
[00:37:41] I had to do an internship to finish my degree.
[00:37:44] So I got an internship with the city of Virginia Beach
[00:37:48] because I wanted to be where he was.
[00:37:50] So you guys, you, you get married.
[00:37:53] Well, he proposes to you.
[00:37:55] And then you get married the old school like what I did.
[00:37:59] My wife and I got married at the San Diego
[00:38:01] courthouse and my chief was like the wet
[00:38:03] because you have to bring a witness.
[00:38:04] So I was like, hey, can you come with witness
[00:38:07] my wedding?
[00:38:08] He's like, you're getting married?
[00:38:09] Yeah.
[00:38:09] OK, so we went down there.
[00:38:11] And this judge goes, all right, you two are married.
[00:38:14] And then we walked out and then we went to
[00:38:16] Danes and had a hamburger.
[00:38:17] That was the honeymoon.
[00:38:19] Oh, bad husband.
[00:38:22] But that's what we did.
[00:38:22] That's sort of, that's what you guys did, too.
[00:38:24] I mean, I think for me, that's a better story.
[00:38:27] Our story.
[00:38:28] We went and got married in this guy's backyard,
[00:38:30] nobody knew.
[00:38:31] We were living in a house with team guys.
[00:38:32] I was living with him and four other team guys in a house.
[00:38:36] It was just like that.
[00:38:37] That was a good guy.
[00:38:38] We can at Bernys, you know, just my poor wife,
[00:38:41] my poor wife did that, too.
[00:38:44] She, well, it wasn't 14 guys, but it was me.
[00:38:47] My running mate team guy roommate who is just the best guy
[00:38:53] ever and also just like you can say, we were all crazy.
[00:38:56] And then so we lived in the upstairs apartment
[00:38:59] and then two other team guys lived below us.
[00:39:01] And it was just, well, I'm sure it was very similar
[00:39:04] to the environment you were in.
[00:39:07] You know, like the furniture was cruise boxes.
[00:39:11] Dinner was dominoes, breakfast was Guinness.
[00:39:15] Lunch was Yager Meister.
[00:39:16] And it was just me.
[00:39:18] Yeah, Chas Brother likes to say,
[00:39:20] remember his coming to visit and he got out of the shower.
[00:39:23] And it was so disgusting.
[00:39:24] He just took a paper towel and like pat it his body dry
[00:39:27] because he didn't want to use anything.
[00:39:29] I mean, I don't know if it was that gross maybe for him.
[00:39:31] But, you know, it was due to house.
[00:39:34] And you know, I got to live there.
[00:39:36] And there was one giant sofa that was the ugliest
[00:39:42] Chad had bought it.
[00:39:42] It was a scanned and navy in print.
[00:39:45] It was the tackiest ugliest thing.
[00:39:46] And literally his entire life, he still talked about that
[00:39:49] stupid sofa.
[00:39:51] So my wife and I, but my old running mate,
[00:39:55] we had this freaking couch that was gold.
[00:40:00] I think it's called velvet velvet.
[00:40:02] Is that what it's called like this kind of like a
[00:40:04] like really soft push back and forth.
[00:40:06] So it was gold velvet.
[00:40:08] It had some kind of wood carvings at the end.
[00:40:10] It had to have been more than 10 feet long.
[00:40:15] It was freaking huge.
[00:40:17] We couldn't do this.
[00:40:18] Yeah.
[00:40:19] And it was the most comfortable couch ever.
[00:40:21] And I think we got it at a whatever a thrift store for
[00:40:24] whatever $38 or something, best couch ever.
[00:40:27] That's what he says.
[00:40:28] And we could fit like three to four full size dudes on it.
[00:40:31] I think it was more typical.
[00:40:32] We'd wake up and one of them would be on the sofa
[00:40:34] just because it was comfortable.
[00:40:35] And they, the house, it was, there was a sofa.
[00:40:39] And there was a calculator.
[00:40:40] Is it?
[00:40:40] And when I told him to put decorations up,
[00:40:44] I was like, you guys need stuff on the wall.
[00:40:46] They hung shooting targets.
[00:40:47] Like the real ones, the pictures, the man on the woman,
[00:40:52] you have on the side.
[00:40:53] Does he have a weapon?
[00:40:54] Does not do a shoot him.
[00:40:56] That was when I froze in our house for a little while.
[00:40:58] Yeah.
[00:40:59] So you got like a heart of really nice welcome to the team community.
[00:41:04] It was.
[00:41:05] Yeah.
[00:41:06] It was such a different life back then.
[00:41:10] Yeah.
[00:41:11] And you go and out with the boys, like when my wife came over
[00:41:15] and we weren't married yet, but when she,
[00:41:17] when we started, which started living with me,
[00:41:19] she would like come out with us, you know, and hang.
[00:41:22] Oh yeah, we'd go out and burn it down.
[00:41:27] I, for, you know, I'm in Virginia Beach.
[00:41:29] And there's this bar that's been there forever.
[00:41:31] Hot tuna.
[00:41:31] They've since read done it.
[00:41:33] But it's hot.
[00:41:33] Hot tuna.
[00:41:34] I just went back literally like two weeks ago
[00:41:36] for the first time.
[00:41:37] And I thought I haven't been here in forever.
[00:41:39] And it took me back to a one night in particular,
[00:41:42] Chad drove a green Jeep Cherokee.
[00:41:44] Still was favorite car, always.
[00:41:46] And we went out with a bunch of guys.
[00:41:49] And we just lifted up the back gate,
[00:41:51] you know, and just shoved them in there.
[00:41:53] Instead of actually, you know, this is a one time go
[00:41:55] for get the seat belt shoving there.
[00:41:57] We went hot tuna.
[00:41:58] Sure enough, there was a fight.
[00:41:59] We got kicked out, told to leave.
[00:42:01] And I just remember running out there,
[00:42:03] throwing up the back gate.
[00:42:05] The guys getting in and we're out.
[00:42:09] And this lifestyle to you, what were you thinking?
[00:42:11] We were like, okay, well, this is the way it is.
[00:42:14] Yeah, I don't even think I thought anything.
[00:42:17] I just was in it.
[00:42:19] And you're military and military kid.
[00:42:22] And you understand just the camaraderie
[00:42:26] that can happen there and the sense of family
[00:42:30] that it can create.
[00:42:32] And I was really happy.
[00:42:34] And I think he was too to have made it to be a team guy.
[00:42:38] He was at teammate.
[00:42:40] Yeah.
[00:42:42] Yeah, I don't know if there's anything better
[00:42:50] than being an E5 in a seal put to.
[00:42:53] It's just freaking awesome.
[00:42:55] And it's everything you just said.
[00:42:56] Well, we had a big wedding later, right?
[00:42:59] So we had a big, I think for our family,
[00:43:01] they wanted like the bigger wedding.
[00:43:03] So in May of now we're gonna go to 2000, I guess.
[00:43:08] We got married.
[00:43:10] And so the boys all decided they were gonna come
[00:43:13] and they rented an RV and they drove from Virginia Beach
[00:43:18] to where we got married.
[00:43:20] And all my girlfriends from college had come
[00:43:23] and they were, you know, don't ask a dumb question.
[00:43:27] They were in the perception and you look around the room
[00:43:30] and there's one huge round table
[00:43:31] with all these really good looking dudes around it.
[00:43:33] And they grow so like, I think that's the Navy seals.
[00:43:35] Not only are they like a bunch of dudes
[00:43:37] and they're good looking.
[00:43:38] And couple of them had like a butterfly stitch on his forehead
[00:43:41] because they stopped in Savannah on that and bar fight.
[00:43:44] So it was like so appropriate, you know?
[00:43:46] It was good.
[00:43:49] When once you moved to Virginia Beach,
[00:43:51] he must've been in a workup.
[00:43:53] When did he go into employment?
[00:43:56] That's when I started to forget.
[00:43:57] So he's already done one to point him
[00:43:59] and he's on the ship.
[00:44:00] And then he comes back and then he did two more there.
[00:44:04] I honestly can't remember the months.
[00:44:05] And so he's going on to point for the first time
[00:44:10] or the first time that you're married.
[00:44:11] So it is, I guess it'd be his second appointment.
[00:44:13] Yeah.
[00:44:14] And now you're like, what did you just say in Virginia Beach
[00:44:17] did you go?
[00:44:19] So this was like I had to do the whole,
[00:44:23] I live there, I did my internship
[00:44:25] and we got really married for real.
[00:44:28] And oh, that's right, because he did deploy
[00:44:30] and I moved back home with my family during that second appointment.
[00:44:35] We were in the middle of like not living anywhere.
[00:44:37] So we lived with the team guys.
[00:44:39] We had our own apartment for a little while.
[00:44:41] And which was also one of the greatest times
[00:44:44] because you don't realize it at the time
[00:44:46] when you're young and you have no money
[00:44:48] and you live in an apartment I think it was $425 a month.
[00:44:52] Pleasure House Road, Shore Drive, Chicks Beach,
[00:44:55] like where everything goes down.
[00:44:57] Just how great that is.
[00:44:58] Who have nothing and you kind of need nothing.
[00:45:02] It's such simplicity.
[00:45:04] So anyway, we moved out of that apartment.
[00:45:06] He left on deployment.
[00:45:07] I went back home to stay with my family.
[00:45:09] What do you mean when you're living that little apartment?
[00:45:12] You know, like what makes that so good?
[00:45:17] I mean, there's nothing to take care of.
[00:45:19] It's an apartment.
[00:45:21] Our friend Lance Vicaro, who passed away in 2008,
[00:45:26] he lived in the same complex.
[00:45:27] So you should the shit with him when you see him.
[00:45:29] And yeah, just like making dinner and eating it on
[00:45:33] that we had a cruise box.
[00:45:34] One of those metal folding collapsible ones.
[00:45:36] Remember those?
[00:45:37] Oh yeah.
[00:45:38] That was our coffee table.
[00:45:39] He just put a little like table cloth over it.
[00:45:42] We'd eat there.
[00:45:43] I was like cooking meals in a crock pot.
[00:45:45] Terrible.
[00:45:46] Me and my buddy had a cruise box that we had,
[00:45:48] like by the big gold couch, we had a cruise box
[00:45:51] that had the phone on it.
[00:45:53] And then on the cruise box was in Sharpie,
[00:45:55] was written everyone's numbers from the different
[00:45:58] tunes and like the T-Merry number.
[00:46:00] Yeah, those are good times.
[00:46:02] I was talking also about the, as you advance in life
[00:46:08] when you get an apartment, that's like step one.
[00:46:11] But then when you get an apartment that has,
[00:46:13] tell them my kids this,
[00:46:14] when you get an apartment that has a washer and dryer,
[00:46:17] like on-site, and that's a big deal.
[00:46:20] And then if you have one that has parking,
[00:46:22] that's like the next big step up in life.
[00:46:24] Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:25] Those things are, those things bring you joy
[00:46:27] when you're young and broke.
[00:46:28] Yeah.
[00:46:29] I've driven by that apartment a few times
[00:46:31] in the last two years,
[00:46:32] and all the places we've lived in Virginia Beach, you know.
[00:46:36] Okay, so you do the big wedding.
[00:46:39] Yep.
[00:46:39] And all these, your girlfriends are there from college.
[00:46:42] There's a bunch of team guys there.
[00:46:44] That sounds like an awesome time.
[00:46:46] And then he's going on to play me again.
[00:46:51] Yeah, so he, we get married.
[00:46:55] He goes on deployment.
[00:46:58] I think before he left on deployment
[00:47:00] is when I found out I was pregnant.
[00:47:03] Mm-hmm.
[00:47:04] Okay.
[00:47:05] Yeah, which was another reason
[00:47:06] they like took me home.
[00:47:07] Okay.
[00:47:08] So we weren't planning it,
[00:47:10] but we weren't not planning it.
[00:47:11] It was kind of like, you know,
[00:47:12] we've been together forever.
[00:47:14] And it is what it is.
[00:47:16] So, so you get pregnant.
[00:47:19] He goes on deployment.
[00:47:20] Yeah.
[00:47:21] You go home to,
[00:47:22] Florida.
[00:47:23] Okay, you're home to Florida.
[00:47:24] And you're living, you know,
[00:47:27] doing whatever you're doing.
[00:47:29] Yeah, and this again was before we didn't have cell phones.
[00:47:33] So, you know, this,
[00:47:36] it's interesting when people are like upset
[00:47:39] because they didn't get to like face time
[00:47:40] what there has been on deployment in today's world, right?
[00:47:43] Because I would miss phone calls.
[00:47:45] And then you don't know when he's going to call you again.
[00:47:47] And we have so many letters he wrote me.
[00:47:50] I'm pretty grateful for that.
[00:47:51] And so I'm in Florida.
[00:47:52] He's deployed.
[00:47:54] Trying to talk to him when I can.
[00:47:55] Go on a baby in my belly and all the things.
[00:48:00] And they come home.
[00:48:01] When did you have the baby while he was on the plunder?
[00:48:03] Did he come home in time?
[00:48:04] Yeah, he came home.
[00:48:05] So, because I was like super newly pregnant when he left.
[00:48:10] So, we know what we're still staying in Virginia Beach.
[00:48:12] So, I go up to Virginia Beach.
[00:48:15] Super pregnant with my mom and buy our first house.
[00:48:18] So, while he's gone.
[00:48:19] So, we.
[00:48:20] Yeah.
[00:48:21] And then he came home from deployment.
[00:48:24] May 2001.
[00:48:27] And my daughter was born in August.
[00:48:30] And now he's still at teammate.
[00:48:32] He's done two deployments.
[00:48:34] And yeah.
[00:48:36] And it's your daughter was born in August of 2001.
[00:48:41] Mm-hmm.
[00:48:42] And he's in another platoon at this point?
[00:48:44] Yeah.
[00:48:45] And he.
[00:48:47] So, he gets there as deployments.
[00:48:49] And for the rest of his time there, he goes to night school.
[00:48:54] Because he's trying to finish his degree.
[00:48:56] So, he finishes his degree at ODU.
[00:48:58] We have a new baby.
[00:49:00] And then he finishes his time.
[00:49:03] He was at trade-et.
[00:49:04] Okay.
[00:49:05] So, we're just like a young family, you know.
[00:49:09] When September 11 happens.
[00:49:11] So, is he at trade-et when September 11 happens?
[00:49:15] He was at, ah.
[00:49:19] Yeah, I think he might have been, actually.
[00:49:21] Yeah.
[00:49:22] And so September 11 happens.
[00:49:24] Now, what are you thinking?
[00:49:26] Ah, that's such crazy.
[00:49:28] Everyone remembers where they were when that happened.
[00:49:33] I don't even think I have the ability to think about it in the scope of the military.
[00:49:39] And what the military was going to do or our country was going to do to react.
[00:49:43] I just was dumbfounded.
[00:49:45] Keep trying to call them at work.
[00:49:46] Couldn't get a hold of them.
[00:49:48] He eventually showed up at the house.
[00:49:50] And we just kind of looked at each other and he's like, holy shit.
[00:49:54] So, and at that point, did you, was he like, okay, I'm going to go back on deployment?
[00:50:01] Was he, what was his plan at that point?
[00:50:06] I mean, I think his plan was to just stay.
[00:50:09] He, at that point, I think he always wanted to just be a career seal.
[00:50:15] So, whatever was going to keep him in the game.
[00:50:17] Quite honestly, we had a conversation after a deployment that he wanted to go to Damneck.
[00:50:22] And I was like, no.
[00:50:27] And I don't even know why I said no.
[00:50:30] I never said no.
[00:50:31] I always like supported him and encouraged him and pushed him.
[00:50:35] But for some reason at that point, I didn't want him to go.
[00:50:39] I don't know how it would have turned out if he would have gone then.
[00:50:42] But yeah, so he stayed in the military, but then, because in all this, when he came home
[00:50:51] from that last deployment, I got pregnant with our son or his third deployment at eight.
[00:50:57] And that was when.
[00:51:00] So, 2001, but fast forward, you know, we're in 2004.
[00:51:05] And I think we both kind of, well, I would say it's more me, we wanted something different.
[00:51:14] So Chad wanted to be a seal.
[00:51:15] He always wanted to be a door kicker.
[00:51:17] That's what he wanted to do, you know, hide in the bushes and do all the things.
[00:51:20] And as military kids, I was really trying to do something different.
[00:51:25] And the grass is greener on the other side, right?
[00:51:28] I moved all the time and I didn't want my kids to have to move all the time.
[00:51:31] And I didn't want their dad to be gone all the time.
[00:51:34] We talked about it and we were making the decision to get out of the military.
[00:51:37] So he had been in 10 years at this point.
[00:51:40] And it's 2004.
[00:51:43] His son is born.
[00:51:44] He wrapped up that last deployment.
[00:51:48] And we got out and moved to Raleigh, North Carolina.
[00:51:50] Do you know where he went?
[00:51:52] No, did he go to Iraq, Raff Ganeson on that deployment?
[00:51:55] Or did he do a different deployment like over to you, Com, or something?
[00:51:57] Uh, I should know these statistics and facts better, but I don't.
[00:52:02] I mean, I'm like 23 with a baby.
[00:52:04] Yeah.
[00:52:05] Well, this would be very similar to asking my wife what I went on to point to you.
[00:52:09] Like I had no idea he was gone.
[00:52:10] That was my wife's attitude too.
[00:52:12] Yeah.
[00:52:13] He's gone.
[00:52:14] He'll be back later.
[00:52:15] Yeah.
[00:52:16] So you all make this decision to get out.
[00:52:21] Right.
[00:52:22] And then what's the plan?
[00:52:24] So at that point, his family's now living in Raleigh, North Carolina.
[00:52:29] And he has his college degree.
[00:52:32] He's done 10 years in the military and he thinks, okay, I'm going to get out and I'm going
[00:52:36] to provide for my family and a civilian world.
[00:52:39] And that's what we did.
[00:52:40] And he got a job in pharmaceuticals.
[00:52:42] You know, there's a lot of research there.
[00:52:45] Um, kind of irony in that when I'm sitting here thinking about him and his life and the
[00:52:50] path that he chose.
[00:52:51] But he was in pharmaceutical research and we just hated it from moment we left.
[00:52:59] I think most people are creatures of habit.
[00:53:02] It's my belief, right?
[00:53:03] People are creatures of habit whether you like that habit or you don't like the habit.
[00:53:07] It's, it just is what it is.
[00:53:08] And our habit is that we are military kids.
[00:53:12] We are used to adversity and challenge and changing dynamics on the regular.
[00:53:19] We're used to different situations and the idea of living in the same house, doing the same
[00:53:25] job with the same people for the rest of your life is nauseating.
[00:53:29] And I don't think it was challenging for him.
[00:53:32] And while he did one of his last jumps with the guys before he left, the guys jumped out
[00:53:38] of the plane and they're like, you're not going to do this with your pharmaceutical
[00:53:41] dudes, you know, and I think that always bugged him.
[00:53:49] And I think like most of these guys, they don't want to feel like they quit, I guess.
[00:53:56] And for Chad anyway, separating from the military and not retiring, he probably felt like
[00:54:02] he wasn't finished.
[00:54:04] And I felt that too because he was miserable.
[00:54:05] He was miserable.
[00:54:06] How long did it take for buyers to set in?
[00:54:10] Like when you get to North Carolina, was there any sort of like honey mood period?
[00:54:13] Hey, we can go on a picnic today and we don't have to worry about anything.
[00:54:16] Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:54:17] How long did that last?
[00:54:18] I mean, I think it lasted for about a year, even though I think in the back of our
[00:54:24] minds, we'd lay in bed and we're like, he'd say,
[00:54:26] what are we doing?
[00:54:27] What are we doing?
[00:54:28] Like, how do they get real?
[00:54:30] Yeah, at night, you know, but then it's like, okay, we're doing it, though, because
[00:54:36] because at the same time, you see it as a challenge in some ways.
[00:54:39] You're like, and I doubting myself because I want to go back or my doubting myself, because
[00:54:43] now I just have this new challenge and I got to like overcome it.
[00:54:46] What was he doing for the pharmaceutical company?
[00:54:49] He was a project manager and I think he was I candy for all the girls and off.
[00:54:56] I know this because my sister in law works in the field too and she would tell me stories,
[00:55:01] but yeah, he tell, I just, he said to me, he came home and he's like Sarah, I was
[00:55:11] sitting in the break room today, celebrating a baby shower, eating a pink, fucking cupcake,
[00:55:18] and I'm questioning my life.
[00:55:20] And you're like, okay, I don't think this is going to work.
[00:55:24] And as cool as it is to have him home every day and he had a good job, we made good
[00:55:30] money, the American dream.
[00:55:31] I mean, our house had a wrap around porch, no joke.
[00:55:35] The picket fence.
[00:55:36] I mean, by most standards, I don't even know if that's fair to say any more in today's
[00:55:42] world, but it was the quote American dream, but it was not our dream.
[00:55:49] How far into it was the cupcake incident?
[00:55:51] Was that like two months into it?
[00:55:52] No, that was closer to the other.
[00:55:53] Those are towards that and that was probably about two years.
[00:55:55] That was like the cupcake that broke the camel's back.
[00:55:58] Totally.
[00:55:59] Pink cupcake broke them.
[00:56:01] I think it just was a real pivot point and this isn't to bash cupcakes or baby showers
[00:56:06] or any of those things, but he's just a dude, you know?
[00:56:13] He's a military dude.
[00:56:15] He's a knife-carrying, you know, dude.
[00:56:20] And for him to put on a business suit in a tie every day, you just, people shouldn't be
[00:56:27] things they're not and that's not who he was.
[00:56:31] So what was the total time that he made it in the pharmaceutical?
[00:56:36] So he left the military in 2004 and we were back in the military September of 2007.
[00:56:44] So like two and a half, two and a half years.
[00:56:46] Yeah.
[00:56:47] When he, like, okay, so he comes home from the cupcake incident, or you just like,
[00:56:53] you can see the misery in his face and you're like, all right, I'm good.
[00:56:56] Let's go.
[00:56:57] Yeah.
[00:56:58] Yeah.
[00:56:59] I, that, we also, I mean, I remember being in the living room and hearing about red wings
[00:57:06] and I was sitting in the living room and watching it on TV and just, him just, you know,
[00:57:12] he was just sitting there, kind of had his hands on his head and he was totally shit.
[00:57:16] I think that probably had a large part, even though we didn't come back for some time,
[00:57:21] I think those things weighed on him.
[00:57:24] The way the world was changing.
[00:57:25] It was ramping up.
[00:57:26] We're now a couple years past 9.11.
[00:57:29] He, he felt called to go back.
[00:57:34] Then he makes a phone call, talk to like some guy or whatever and team guy recruiter or something.
[00:57:40] Yeah.
[00:57:41] We didn't really know how that was going to play out, right?
[00:57:42] I mean, they could have just said, no, you left.
[00:57:45] But I think at the time, you know, he, you know, he was a team guy that done a few deployments.
[00:57:51] He had good service, respected.
[00:57:53] They said sure.
[00:57:55] But they told him because he hadn't deployed in, you know, almost three years.
[00:58:00] He had to go back through, um, oh, S-t-t.
[00:58:04] Well, it was S-t-t when he graduated.
[00:58:06] Yeah.
[00:58:07] S-t-t-t.
[00:58:08] S-t-t-t.
[00:58:09] Yeah.
[00:58:10] So, we, I mean, he left for work one day.
[00:58:13] He had talked to this guy.
[00:58:14] He was kind of figuring out if this was going to work or not.
[00:58:16] And he left for work one day.
[00:58:17] And I just said, his tie and his suit and all of the, I said, this is stupid.
[00:58:22] We got to go back and we sold our house and he signed up to go back and we sold a lot
[00:58:30] of what we owned.
[00:58:32] And because there was no need to have it, we were going to move to California.
[00:58:36] He said if he had to go back to their S-t-t again, he wanted to just go to a West Coast
[00:58:39] team, um, just so we could all be out there together.
[00:58:43] And we put a little bit of things in a U-hall and the kids and I flew out to San Diego.
[00:58:51] And I had never been there.
[00:58:52] Oh, I came out and like house-hunted, try to find an apartment for us a couple weeks prior,
[00:58:56] but other than that, I hadn't really spent any time out here.
[00:58:59] And he drove a U-hall across country, chowing down on some flower seeds and just going
[00:59:05] like 90 and like, you know, jacked up on caffeine and got there.
[00:59:13] Then where did you guys move into?
[00:59:14] Did you guys move to Coronado?
[00:59:15] Yeah.
[00:59:16] We found this cool little, I just got lucky, found this cool little apartment.
[00:59:20] Same thing, kind of like our first apartment.
[00:59:22] It, I mean, this place can be more than 800 square feet.
[00:59:26] It was two bedrooms, one bathroom.
[00:59:29] It was our entire B-A-H, maybe even a little bit more, and our kids shared a room.
[00:59:35] Did you say you had been to San Diego before or you had not?
[00:59:38] I had only come out like a week or two before to try to find a place to live.
[00:59:43] What were you thinking when you drove from San Diego over the Coronado Bay Bridge and you
[00:59:47] see Coronado first?
[00:59:48] I was flipping my live.
[00:59:50] I just was like, yes, amazing.
[00:59:53] It's one of the craziest sites I think.
[00:59:56] Were you bringing anyone to San Diego and you going to Coronado and you drive over the
[01:00:00] bridge and you just see Coronado?
[01:00:01] Yeah.
[01:00:02] It's ridiculous.
[01:00:03] It is.
[01:00:04] It's ridiculous.
[01:00:05] I've spent most of my youth on the East Coast and almost always close to a beach.
[01:00:11] I always, you know, I don't want to live more than 30 minutes from a beach.
[01:00:14] Let's be honest.
[01:00:15] So the fact that I could flip coast and live here and on Coronado is, yeah.
[01:00:21] And there's the mosquitoes here.
[01:00:22] I had the friend coming out and him and his wife and like it was getting to be dusk.
[01:00:29] And they were like, oh, the mosquitoes are going to call him.
[01:00:31] Like there's no mosquitoes here.
[01:00:32] They didn't believe me.
[01:00:33] They didn't believe.
[01:00:34] They didn't believe.
[01:00:35] And you're talking about how could there be no mosquitoes?
[01:00:37] It's totally crazy.
[01:00:40] So now you're living in Coronado.
[01:00:42] Yeah.
[01:00:43] Kind of living the dream, taking bikes around the sidewalk, walking to get coffee and
[01:00:48] all that stuff.
[01:00:49] Oh, yeah.
[01:00:50] I got a rad little beach cruiser, chatbot me and kids were little and my son learned
[01:00:55] to ride a two-wheeler at two.
[01:00:58] And he had this little mini bike and we made friends with the guy in the bike shop and
[01:01:02] his name's my son's Hudson and Hudson would ride in the bike shop on Monday.
[01:01:05] The guy's like, hey, little man, come here and he swapped out.
[01:01:08] I should show you a picture of this.
[01:01:10] He swapped out at the handlebars of his bike for a-pangers.
[01:01:13] Oh, dang.
[01:01:14] So he just like he turned three and he was a three year old with this like little
[01:01:17] mini bike and he's a pay-panger handlebars.
[01:01:20] That's great.
[01:01:22] And chat's going to ask you tea this time.
[01:01:24] So ask you tea just serve on those.
[01:01:26] When you get done with buds, you go.
[01:01:29] You graduate from buds and after buds they start to teach you some stuff in this thing called
[01:01:33] that's QT.
[01:01:34] You don't really learn anything in buds other than how to go through suffering and then
[01:01:38] you get to ask you tea and they start teaching you like all the fundamental basic individual
[01:01:44] skills of being a seal at a higher level.
[01:01:47] And occasionally like Chad's a perfect example.
[01:01:50] Guys, guys out for three years, hey, we got new radios.
[01:01:54] We need, we can't just throw them back in a cartoon.
[01:01:56] All right, send them through ask you tea.
[01:01:57] So occasionally that happens.
[01:01:59] Sometimes God doesn't even have to get out.
[01:02:01] If a guy's on short duty for three years and he's been in some billet where he's not
[01:02:05] operational for three years, that'll be like, hey, you know, you go back to rescue tea and
[01:02:10] use a guy's a cool, you got it.
[01:02:12] And so you're doing individual skills, but he, in that position, all the other guys, first
[01:02:18] of all the other guys don't even have their tridents yet.
[01:02:21] So he's a actual seal.
[01:02:23] And they're, they're just not even new guys yet because they don't even have their
[01:02:28] tridents.
[01:02:29] So he's in a position of like real mentorship and to help them out and they're looking
[01:02:36] up to him.
[01:02:37] So that's, that's what's happening with him.
[01:02:39] Definitely.
[01:02:40] He, one thing I always loved about Chad is he is very good at teaching you what he
[01:02:47] knows without making you feel dumb.
[01:02:51] I think he gets a lot of that probably from his dad and his, the way his dad is.
[01:02:55] But I think that that's a real skill and try to like foster your own learning while he's
[01:03:02] teaching you something.
[01:03:03] And so I think it was a really natural fit for him while he was in SQT to just be the
[01:03:09] guy that would, you know, lean into guys and say, hey man, this is how I like rig my gear
[01:03:14] up this way.
[01:03:15] And I, you know, do this this way.
[01:03:18] And I think it was a good experience, hopefully, for the guys that were with them, you
[01:03:23] know, to have this more senior person around, but it was also good for Chad.
[01:03:28] And this didn't you start doing CrossFit at this time out here?
[01:03:31] Oh, yeah.
[01:03:32] Yeah.
[01:03:33] And was that Andy's gym?
[01:03:35] Andy stopped.
[01:03:36] Yeah.
[01:03:37] So the reason I'm laughing is because, you know, you're talking about how Chad was the type
[01:03:42] of person that could teach you something without making you feel bad about what you don't
[01:03:47] know.
[01:03:48] I think Andy might be the opposite of that.
[01:03:50] Andy, like, enjoys their feet got to teach somebody something.
[01:03:53] He teaches me stuff that I already know he makes me feel stupid.
[01:03:56] Yeah.
[01:03:57] That's definitely more his personality.
[01:03:58] He likes to have fun with it.
[01:03:59] Yeah.
[01:04:00] Yeah, definitely.
[01:04:01] So you, so this is Andy had like a CrossFit gym in Coronado.
[01:04:05] Yeah.
[01:04:06] And so you just rolled in there and signed up.
[01:04:07] Did you know anything about CrossFit at the time?
[01:04:09] So when we were in Raleigh, Chad started doing CrossFit.
[01:04:12] This was like 2005.
[01:04:14] And he was so into CrossFit.
[01:04:17] I was so not into CrossFit.
[01:04:19] It was kind of how that played out.
[01:04:20] I remember Cook and Dinner one night and he said, you need to come in the garage.
[01:04:23] I got this thing called a muscle up and I was like, oh, and I opened the door and he did
[01:04:27] it and I was like, cool.
[01:04:28] And then slam the door.
[01:04:29] Like a total jerk.
[01:04:31] So he had put me through some workouts and our garage in Raleigh, but I, that minimal exposure,
[01:04:37] you know, and living in Coronado and having two little kids and he's busy with work.
[01:04:42] I feel like, you know, I'm a mom with two kids.
[01:04:44] I probably need to exercise a little bit more.
[01:04:46] Right in my bike one day, I just passed the gym and it was news like literally like just
[01:04:51] opening and I called him.
[01:04:53] Didn't know Andy Stomp at the time.
[01:04:55] Called him up and said, hey, can I come to your gym and that was it?
[01:04:58] That was it.
[01:04:59] Was he teaching?
[01:05:01] Not as much as wife Jamie was teaching a lot.
[01:05:07] Sage Castro.
[01:05:08] Dave Castro's wife was coaching their son.
[01:05:11] Right on.
[01:05:12] It was such, you know, this was the early days.
[01:05:14] We were talking 2007 of, you know, of CrossFit gym kind of expanding.
[01:05:21] And so it was a small gym, not a lot of trainers.
[01:05:24] Yeah, this is so like this is when Dave Castro was teaching SQT.
[01:05:31] Yes.
[01:05:32] And like I think they ran a level one course at SQT.
[01:05:39] And I went and went through it and just like hung out and got whatever some kind of
[01:05:43] certification for that.
[01:05:45] And then that's probably the first time that I met and started hanging out with Dave Castro.
[01:05:50] I think that's it because he was running that and he was like helping me out.
[01:05:53] And then we eventually, well, when we opened this gym that we're sitting in right now, that
[01:05:58] was 2007.
[01:05:59] That was late 2007.
[01:06:00] So we had the, you know, I had to go to the like the shirts and stuff like this that
[01:06:06] you have to get back in the day.
[01:06:08] Yeah.
[01:06:09] He's going to try to keep your gym.
[01:06:11] Yeah, to keep your gym.
[01:06:12] And so you get, you get into it.
[01:06:14] You kind of get into it.
[01:06:15] Yeah, I do, I get really into it.
[01:06:19] I just, you know, I like the challenge.
[01:06:21] I like the physical challenge.
[01:06:22] I like the way my body was changing.
[01:06:25] Remember I'm a mom, a two kids.
[01:06:26] So yeah, I get into it.
[01:06:30] And so I got the opportunity to go to my level one.
[01:06:32] Didn't want to coach people ever, never, never my plan.
[01:06:36] I just wanted to know more about it.
[01:06:37] So I went to my level one in San Diego one weekend.
[01:06:42] Yeah.
[01:06:43] Okay, and then Chad, what's SQT 6, 6 months?
[01:06:46] Something like that.
[01:06:47] Yeah.
[01:06:48] And he's thinking West Coast team, you're living the dream, living in Coronado.
[01:06:52] Yeah.
[01:06:53] And then what happens there?
[01:06:55] Well, Bill King happened.
[01:06:59] The CEO from Damneck came to the West Coast to talk to the SQT guys and to explain
[01:07:06] to them down the pipeline if they want to ever, you know, bridge that gap and head
[01:07:11] over to Seal Team 6.
[01:07:14] Here's kind of what you need to do.
[01:07:16] Most of those guys when they finished SQT as you said they get their trident, they go to
[01:07:19] a regular team, they've got to do two to three deployments, you know, become maybe a little
[01:07:25] less green and then they can screen to go to Damneck.
[01:07:29] And that's when Chad went and took it upon himself to introduce himself to him and say,
[01:07:33] hey, my name is Chad Wilkinson.
[01:07:35] Here's a little bit of my story.
[01:07:37] I'm going to finish this up.
[01:07:38] I'm going to go to West Coast team and then in the future, I plan to go to the West Coast team.
[01:07:41] And I'm coming to screen and he just said, how about you don't and just come screen right
[01:07:46] now?
[01:07:47] That was that.
[01:07:49] Yeah, and he didn't consult me at all.
[01:07:52] So what did you get six months in the nodo?
[01:07:55] Yeah, that's just about it.
[01:07:57] I was pretty upset.
[01:07:58] I mean, but not, right?
[01:08:01] I mean, this is our life and this is our path, but I did not want to leave.
[01:08:05] Yeah, he came home and he said, hey, I'm going to fly to Virginia Beach next weekend and
[01:08:09] do this thing to screen and if that's the case, we're moving.
[01:08:13] And yeah, fast forward, we moved back to Virginia Beach April of 2008.
[01:08:18] Did you move back there even before like while he's starting to go through green team and
[01:08:22] everything?
[01:08:23] Oh, yeah, yeah, we moved like with him.
[01:08:25] Like he left to go to green team, we moved back.
[01:08:30] So then he makes it through green team and starts the cycle over there, which is deployment,
[01:08:36] deployment, deployment, work deployment, work deployment, work deployment, work deployment, work
[01:08:39] deployment, work deployment, work deployment.
[01:08:40] At that time, yeah, 2008 it was fast and furious.
[01:08:45] It was busy.
[01:08:47] And when you get to Virginia Beach, are you, what'd you do with your CrossFit deal?
[01:08:51] So I moved back to Virginia Beach.
[01:08:54] I check out, at the time, there were only two other gyms in the area and I couldn't
[01:08:59] really take my kids because this was before there were a lot of kids spaces in CrossFit
[01:09:05] gyms and there was really no where safer them to be.
[01:09:08] We rented an apartment when we came back to Virginia Beach not knowing where we wanted to live.
[01:09:13] And also not knowing if the whole green team thing was going to pan out.
[01:09:16] I think for Chad, he just was like, I don't really know.
[01:09:20] And he rented a garage in this apartment complex and we bought enough equipment so that
[01:09:26] we could put two people he and I essentially threw a workout.
[01:09:30] And then my girlfriend said, well, can I come work out with you?
[01:09:34] I was like, sure.
[01:09:36] And then that just kind of grew and grew and then we had a whole bunch of people outside
[01:09:41] of the garage one day and fast forward October 2008.
[01:09:44] I opened my gym.
[01:09:46] So he's in green team and anybody who's listening and has lived that is very stressful.
[01:09:55] Especially when you're doing all these things and you come home and you got your wife
[01:09:59] and your kids and you got to do the family man thing too.
[01:10:02] And then I go ahead to take it upon myself to start this whole business venture.
[01:10:07] Yeah.
[01:10:08] You rented, how many of you was the space that you rented for that CrossFit gym?
[01:10:12] Oh, the first one?
[01:10:13] Yeah.
[01:10:13] Who?
[01:10:14] It was like 12 to 1300 square feet.
[01:10:17] And I just remember saying in the car, I was like, I need to do this because this is,
[01:10:24] this is about to take off and this is what all I want to do.
[01:10:28] I think he was a little worried because, you know, in our,
[01:10:33] in our, in our, in our, in our world, you live a really quiet life and he didn't want anything that I was doing
[01:10:41] to not overshadow but have any sort of imprint on what he was doing.
[01:10:48] Yeah.
[01:10:48] You know, and of course in a military town, the, the interesting part about Oating the gym is
[01:10:55] what you're doing is you're providing a service to people and it's a very personal service.
[01:11:01] So people think they know you and what happens is your friends come and join the gym and I had kind of
[01:11:07] established at the very beginning like we're friends, but at the same time this is, this is a, you know,
[01:11:13] a business and you do, if, if you're a team life, you don't talk about it in this gym.
[01:11:18] You don't, I don't want to hear when your husband's coming home.
[01:11:21] I don't want to hear when your husband's leaving.
[01:11:23] I don't want to hear about another spouse.
[01:11:25] That just wasn't going to fly.
[01:11:27] So, so we were busy.
[01:11:30] I would too little kids.
[01:11:31] And how did the gym take off? How did it do?
[01:11:33] It went, it was awesome.
[01:11:35] My whole hope was just to be able to cover the rent and my expenses and we exceeded that the first month.
[01:11:42] The first month.
[01:11:44] And we were still working on a lot of things though, you know, the first person that came
[01:11:48] beyond my kids and they had a little kid, I didn't know what to do with them. So I stacked up some
[01:11:53] tires and I just stuck the kid in the center of the tires. I like to just stay there,
[01:11:58] to where done. Because it was such a small space. I look back at those pictures now.
[01:12:02] I'll land anybody from CrossFit listening. And I do not know how someone didn't get clubbed
[01:12:07] in the head of the barbell. How close we were, but it all worked out.
[01:12:12] In meanwhile, Chad's, like you said, this is now 2008. So it's just, um, it's on.
[01:12:18] Yeah. And he's going on deployments. And now we kind of already talked about this. And I mentioned
[01:12:24] that my wife would be like, I don't even know where my husband's at. He's gone. And he'll be back later.
[01:12:29] And that was kind of her attitude. And it's, I think quite frankly, well, I can't speak for
[01:12:35] everybody, but it definitely worked for my wife. You know, she just, hey, you go do what you
[01:12:40] got to do. I'll be here. I'll be here, man in the fort, back home. And that was good.
[01:12:45] Maybe it would have been more stressful if she knew where I was or what I was doing or anything
[01:12:49] like that. She just was like, you go do what you got to do. Did you guys have that? Was that sort
[01:12:54] of the way you guys operated? Yeah. I mean, when he, when he was deploying, it was Iraq, Afghanistan,
[01:13:01] then it became Africa. And I knew, generally, you know, what country he was in. But beyond that,
[01:13:09] that's how we always operated was you do your job. And I'll do my job, meaning take care of our
[01:13:16] kids when you're gone. And when you're gone, you're gone and when you're home, your home.
[01:13:21] I know some other spouses, they share a whole lot. And they, they know probably way more stories
[01:13:26] about their husband than I know. And maybe almost too much, but Chad really, really lived by the fact
[01:13:34] that you don't talk about it. And it could have much to what you said, maybe he just didn't want
[01:13:39] me to worry either. That's what I'd like to think. And vice versa, I didn't call him and say,
[01:13:46] I mean, my hot water heater busted one time in the attic and flooding everywhere. What's it
[01:13:51] going to do if I call him? And now, so you know, seal why it's a tough to. Yeah, definitely. And I think,
[01:14:00] you know, you said, you said you weren't sure if Chad didn't want you to worry. I can almost
[01:14:05] guarantee you that the attitude was like the last thing he wants you to do is worry. And I remember
[01:14:11] one of my guys, Mikey Montsour, who, you know, he died at the end of our deployment. But when
[01:14:17] when I got home and talking to his family and his sister Sarah was, you know, just telling me,
[01:14:25] this was, we were in this place called Ramani. It was a really kinetic deployment with a lot of
[01:14:31] casualties. And he had told his family, you know, when he would call them, oh yeah, we're just,
[01:14:38] you know, we're just training some Iraqis. We're, yeah, if we're not doing anything, it's boring,
[01:14:42] like all these kind of things. I mean, these are just outright not true at all. But he just didn't
[01:14:46] want his family to worry about what he was doing. Yeah, and we had certain like code things. I knew
[01:14:51] when he would call me and he would say, okay, I'll call you when I can and I love you,
[01:14:57] he was going out. He was going out to do stuff. And I, you know, what he called me in a day,
[01:15:02] would it be three or four days? I don't know, but I knew that meant he was going to be busy.
[01:15:08] And I'll also say, like, from my perspective again, this is just me. But I don't want to talk to my
[01:15:14] wife about that stuff. You know, I don't want to talk to my wife. I don't want to explain to her what's
[01:15:19] going on with this. And what I don't want, I don't want to talk to her about like what are kids are doing
[01:15:24] or what we're having for dinner or whatever. I want to talk about other stuff. That's what I want to
[01:15:28] talk about. I don't want to talk about team guy stuff with my wife. That's not, so maybe that,
[01:15:34] you know, plays into it too. And yeah, I mean, like I said, my wife would shoot barely know
[01:15:41] what I was going or whatever. And it's partly because I didn't want to worry about, but also,
[01:15:45] I just don't want to talk about other stuff. Yeah. Talk about work. You know,
[01:15:51] 19 hours with these dudes. I want to talk about it with you, darling. I don't want to talk about
[01:15:56] something else. But at some point, you must have realized, or did you start to see like,
[01:16:03] hey, these things are wearing on Chad? These deployments are like, was there a change in his
[01:16:09] attitude and his personality in the way he carried himself? Yes, and no, I think it's hard to
[01:16:22] distinguish when exactly that was. And I'm going to bounce around a minute. I just had to scroll
[01:16:29] through a bunch of photos, Jason and I were working on something. And they're scrolling through
[01:16:33] those photos the other day. What I realized is when he really got bad, it was two years before he
[01:16:40] died. So 2016, I can almost see it through photos. But even before that, I do know, I know some
[01:16:51] stories now since he's died that he never shared with me in 2012 was a pretty big deployment,
[01:16:57] I guess, or crazy deployment. I don't know the best way to say that. And I think some stuff
[01:17:02] happened there. And 2014, he was starting to change a little bit more. But what a spouse says is,
[01:17:13] well, that's just how they are. And the world, the media talks, you know, maybe seals are big
[01:17:21] in the news now, right? Since 9-11, since May of 2011, they're all over and they're made to be
[01:17:30] larger than life. And they use these words. And so if a guy has always told how brave and fearless
[01:17:37] and heroic and strong they are, then he's got to believe that. He's got to live that. And then on
[01:17:44] the same token, you see with our special operators how they are, you know, quiet and how they do
[01:17:51] sit in the corner of the room. And their back is always, you know, to the wall. And they're always
[01:17:55] facing the door. And they don't want to engage in conversational all the time. And just
[01:18:00] chalk up all those PTSD symptoms that people like to throw out. But it's, I think it's very easy
[01:18:07] for someone like a spouse to say, well, that's just kind of how the guys are. Because they have a
[01:18:12] stressful job. And they're beat down. Their bodies broken. So, so you said when you're looking at
[01:18:19] pictures now and you're going through the years, you can kind of start to identify things that you
[01:18:25] saw that you, when you look back, it becomes a little bit, this has become more obvious as you look back.
[01:18:30] Yeah, yeah. I mean, I, I couldn't tell you then. But it's, it's more obvious to me now.
[01:18:37] This might be a dumb question. But do you think that that has to do with the fact that we don't
[01:18:43] get taught anything about this kind of stuff? We mean, and maybe it's more prevalent now. But
[01:18:50] you know, I did a couple podcasts on here about Louis Poler, Louis Poler Jr. He was the son of a
[01:19:02] famous Marine, the most famous Marine named Chester Poler. And Louis Poler was, he, his dad,
[01:19:11] Chester Poler was like the, the most iconic Marine ever. And he received five Navy crosses. And he,
[01:19:22] the, here's a good way to describe how iconic he is. He, the Marine Corps has a, has a,
[01:19:30] what is it a mascot? And they've had one. It's a bulldog. And yeah, the mascot, I think they're on number
[01:19:36] 17, but the mascot is named Chester. And at boot camp, they sing a good night Chester,
[01:19:42] whatever, you may be. That's what they do in Marine Corps, Lucas. So this guy, Chester Poler,
[01:19:46] the most iconic Marine of all time. And he had a son. And his son was, uh, not quite cut from the
[01:19:55] same cloth as his dad. You know, his dad was this kind of gruff guy. And this son was sort of
[01:20:01] a more mild guy. He wore glasses. He went to college. He, uh, was just more of a cerebral type guy.
[01:20:10] And he gets done with college. And he's not really sure what he's going to do with his life.
[01:20:14] So he decides to, well, you know, my dad was in the Marine Corps. So he goes to join the Marine
[01:20:20] Corps. He can barely get in because his, his eyesight's bad. The people that are looking at his
[01:20:26] application are like, wait a second, this is Lewis Poler Jr. Are you Chester Poler son? Is that,
[01:20:31] yeah, but we can get you in. So he gets in the Marine Corps. Goes through Hofstra County School,
[01:20:37] goes to the basics school. And then it's 1968. So he goes to Vietnam. And when he gets to Vietnam,
[01:20:49] going on rotations in these three different spots. And eventually, uh, goes on an operation.
[01:20:55] And he steps on a landmine. Get severely wounded. He loses both of his legs. He loses a bunch of his
[01:21:03] fingers and dexterity in his hands. Almost dies. I mean, it's just a miracle that they were able
[01:21:09] to keep my life. And he, he does stay alive. Um, it comes back to America. You know, devastating
[01:21:17] for his dad, the great iconic Marine hero is breaking down when he sees his son. Chester Poler,
[01:21:29] Lewis Poler, you know, eventually recovered from his wounds. And uh, wrote a book called
[01:21:36] Fortune at Son, which is an incredible book. And sort of, you know, he was, he'd gone down the path of
[01:21:42] alcohol and being an alcoholic and all this. And, um, eventually comes out of that writes this book,
[01:21:50] the book, it's published. And in 1994, he fell out of his wheelchair injured himself, went back
[01:22:00] in the hospital. Um, they put him on painkillers. He got addicted to painkillers again. And, and he killed himself.
[01:22:08] Um, and what was, when I, when I did this series of podcasts about this, what was crazy was
[01:22:17] every single Marine, every single Marine, 100% knows who Chester Poler is. But,
[01:22:26] a vast majority of Marines that I talked to as that podcast was coming out, did not know
[01:22:32] the story of his son. And it seems like the perfect way to educate people about the
[01:22:44] hardships that people face when they come home for more and they, you know, obviously,
[01:22:47] Lewis Poler had a multitude of hardships as well. But it seems like the education that we receive
[01:22:55] and not just us in the military, but then the families just that there's things, hey,
[01:23:00] this is what we need to be looking out for. And it, it seems like if you're, if you now are looking
[01:23:09] back at pictures to be able to say, man, I see this. I remember this. These are the kind of things.
[01:23:16] Is this like, like part of the things that you're trying to share now so that people have
[01:23:21] better education about this kind of stuff? Oh my gosh. Yes. Yes. And again, I'm no scientist. I'm
[01:23:28] no doctor. I don't have a research under my belt, but I have what I've lived. And sitting in my chair,
[01:23:36] having been with this person for so long. You know, we, we, I didn't just like meet a team guy,
[01:23:42] and then we got married, and that's not to bust on anybody that did. But, you know, I've known
[01:23:47] him almost his entire life. And then to watch him through his career and then to lose him in this way,
[01:23:55] I didn't see all these signs and symptoms prior. I think if Chad, I want to believe that if Chad
[01:24:05] thought something was wrong with him that he was probably trying to hide it from me. I have
[01:24:12] other girlfriends, widows, whose husbands took their life. And they have said that their husbands
[01:24:18] expressed to them the struggle they were having and what they were thinking about. And you know,
[01:24:24] their signs and symptoms, and I didn't have that. And it's not going to be the same for everybody
[01:24:29] or humans or all different. Biological DNA, I'd express itself differently. But if we could maybe
[01:24:36] educate people a little bit more about the toll your service takes. And, and to know that even if you're
[01:24:47] not killed in action or killed in training or you don't die by suicide, but you've led a very
[01:24:54] active career. You are going to be impacted some more than others. And let's really have a conversation
[01:25:02] about what you might see and when is it going to be really problem?
[01:25:06] So as these deployments are adding up for Chad, I mean, is when he's coming home, is it
[01:25:17] what is the kind of things you're noticing? Well, he's always super quiet guy, never the loudest guy in
[01:25:27] the room reserved. But as time goes on, he's even less. And when we first, you know, a teammate
[01:25:38] we hung out with people and had friends and when we first got to the command, we did that too.
[01:25:42] And then over time, we just didn't. We didn't do social things. I mean, we almost never
[01:25:47] ever had anyone over to our house, ever. He never wanted anybody in our house. He, he any
[01:25:55] says he likes to be home. He like to be home with the kids and I kind of what you mentioned. He's like,
[01:25:59] I'm with those dudes all the time. Like, I don't need to go hang out with them because I've just spent,
[01:26:04] you know, a rut trip in Chicago with them and I'm home now. But it, it, it, what got really bad right
[01:26:11] away was a sleep. And I think that that's true for a lot of the guys is that, you know, sleep is so
[01:26:19] valued. And it's, if you think of your body, I like to think of it as a computer. And if you don't
[01:26:23] turn the computer down every once in a while and reboot boot it and it gets jacked up, right?
[01:26:27] Doesn't run well. And that's what sleep provides all of us every single night. And if you've got a guy
[01:26:35] who has his body hurts, I mean, Chad fell off of a ladder, pretty high up and Jack does back up.
[01:26:42] He messed his neck up off of a couple of blending. He did. He was in the helicopter crash in 98.
[01:26:48] So, you know, I mean, his body, and I say this because I know so many of the guys are like really
[01:26:56] broken and he's probably the least of it in terms of broken bones and this and that, but his body
[01:27:02] is beat up as most of them are. And then you add on top of that just the mental strain of war.
[01:27:08] Just deployments, you know, sleep and over and some shitty ass village compound, you know,
[01:27:19] you're listening to blast coming in. The high cycle of just like missions going out, going out,
[01:27:25] going out, okay? Being away from your family and even though I didn't call my husband and say,
[01:27:30] hey, this is broken or I need this. Maybe that's all other spouses communicates. And now there
[01:27:36] might be stress because they got shit going on back home with their family and so let's all
[01:27:41] add all that on to it. And now let's add at least for our special operators, the whole blast injury
[01:27:47] concept. And the guys that have spent time and I'm going to talk teams because that's what I know,
[01:27:55] but time and the teams, the last 10 to 20 years, they 100% in my opinion are affected by blast injury
[01:28:04] because it comes from them breaching doors, which they do not just overseas, but in training,
[01:28:09] you know, he lows RPGs all that and that constant impact to the brain is
[01:28:17] terrible. It's terrible. And so you add all this stuff this guy's a con through and he can't sleep.
[01:28:26] He can't get a good night's sleep. So there's nothing helping him for his body to at least try to
[01:28:32] recover something. So his sleep went down bad. See, as he seen doctors or anything, as he
[01:28:39] talking to anybody about trying to get sleep. I mean, sometimes, you know, at some points, they were
[01:28:42] given away like the sleep potions like it was nothing. Oh, yeah. I mean, he did, he tried to do a lot of
[01:28:49] his own stuff, just like normal regular remedy stuff and better sleep hygiene. And then he was
[01:28:55] diagnosed with sleep apnea, which a lot of them have. So they have a CPAP machine. I mean, why are
[01:29:01] their dudes in their 30s and 40s with sleep apnea? Doesn't, and not weird. And then, you know,
[01:29:08] and then what you also see in these guys is they get low testosterone and because of, you know,
[01:29:14] there are adrenal glands or jacked out. Their cortisol levels are jacked up. And so their testosterone
[01:29:19] is jacked up. And I don't know how many of them are really willing to talk about it, but I think
[01:29:24] there's a really large number of dudes in special operations that are in their 30s
[01:29:29] that are on testosterone. And they're not, I can't speak for everyone. I mean, I think they're
[01:29:35] on it for like the next time they want to be jacked. They're on it because their teeth really low.
[01:29:39] And that's needed, you know? Oh, yeah, that's not getting fired up. Yeah. So, you're seeing all this
[01:29:48] stuff. Is there a point where you start like trying to intervene yourself or is Chad just like,
[01:29:55] you know, again, I'm comparing this to my experience. Like, I would never, my wife didn't know
[01:30:02] if there was anything going on. Like, with bad things, we're happening at work. My wife would not know.
[01:30:07] Well, and this is where like regret comes in and just kind of guilt. A lot of guilt.
[01:30:17] Because it's really easy to sit here now and list all the things I could have done to be a
[01:30:22] better wife. But at the time, I... Chad and I, Chad and I are both the type of people that
[01:30:38] we want to work really hard at what we do and we want to be really, really freaking good at it.
[01:30:47] Being married to him while there are spouses and they choose to, to, whatever they're out,
[01:30:51] maybe they work, maybe they stay out with their kids, everybody gets a choice, right?
[01:30:55] And my choice was to work and go this whole fitness CrossFit path. So, when you're married to someone
[01:31:01] who's its neighbor, you see, and does all these awesome things and gets these awards,
[01:31:05] I was super proud of them, but I also wanted my own identity and I wanted my own success.
[01:31:11] And in a lot of that driving force, truthfully, was always because I wanted him to be proud of me.
[01:31:17] And so he's working hard in the teams and I'm working really hard on this whole CrossFit side.
[01:31:24] And I don't think it's that I didn't want to intervene. I just kind of thought we both were
[01:31:33] almost like handling our shit. If that's fair to say. Like, okay, you're working, you're busy,
[01:31:39] you know, you're moving up, you know, within your troop and squadron and the whole thing. And
[01:31:46] I'm doing it over here and then we come home and we take our kids and
[01:31:52] I guess I just didn't take enough of responsibility for that.
[01:32:03] Is there, is there some point where you say, okay, this was sort of
[01:32:09] where you said, you said when you were looking through pictures, you said two years before you died,
[01:32:14] you were like, yeah, I look back now and that this is a time period where there was definitely
[01:32:20] he was, you know, over the edge. Yeah, I mean, he really got a shorter fuse for sure.
[01:32:28] And it generally wasn't with me. It tended to be more with our kids. He would just snap,
[01:32:34] which was really out of character for him. And he would not listen. And I think a lot of
[01:32:43] spouses say, you know, my husband doesn't listen to me. I've doesn't listen to me when I'm talking,
[01:32:47] but it's like he had no idea I was talking to. And I'd be sitting right next to him. And
[01:32:56] I've shared this story before, but I think it really says something that he,
[01:33:01] I said, Chad, you never listened to me. Like, just look at me. I need you to look at me and I need
[01:33:06] you to focus. And he said, you know what, when you talk to me, I have to look around and think,
[01:33:12] well, that's not going to kill me. And that's not going to kill me. And I remember thinking,
[01:33:17] that's so weird. But now I realize if you're kind of in this hyper state and you don't have a way to
[01:33:26] get out of it, you go into a poignant and you kind of have to stay on point, right? Heads always
[01:33:30] on a swivel, you may win your in bed, you got to be ready for the next thing. How do you turn that off
[01:33:35] when you come home? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. They've really figured that out. So they come home
[01:33:42] and they're still kind of like overloaded. And that's something that you notice because you're talking
[01:33:47] to them and he's like not responding. And yeah, and in the pictures two years prior and the pictures
[01:33:53] when I look at it, he just had a completely different look on his face. It was almost like,
[01:33:59] like in pictures, it was almost like I'm going to kill you, you know, like that whole like,
[01:34:04] it just, it's just not like him. Yeah, that's the interesting thing that you pointed out is like
[01:34:12] you've known him since he was whatever 15. Yeah. And so you see this entire arc of a human
[01:34:19] whereas, you know, if you cut out, if you met him in 2010, you would see this much smaller picture
[01:34:28] that maybe wouldn't paint such a dramatic change in his character and the way he acted. Right?
[01:34:35] But you saw him since he was 15 years old and, you know, and then you see this whole story play out.
[01:34:43] And so it becomes real clear. There also being said, since you're with him every day,
[01:34:50] you know, you're around him all the time. So there's also that that thing where,
[01:34:55] you know, you don't notice that someone, you know, like, you don't notice that my hair's going
[01:34:59] right, right? Because like my wife doesn't, she might notice it now. But, you know, over time.
[01:35:05] So like, oh, your hair went great today, right? It's like happens gradually over time. And so
[01:35:09] there's some of that. I'm sure it play too where, you know, one deployment, there's three degrees
[01:35:14] of change, right? The next deployment, there's four degrees of change. The next deployment,
[01:35:19] there's five degrees of change. Okay. So you look up in six deployments and that little bit each time
[01:35:25] you may not notice it so dramatically. But from the, the, the amount that he's on a different course,
[01:35:31] mentally is dramatic. Yeah. And I, and I, I tried to take it back through chunks of our life.
[01:35:38] And go back as far as our childhood. But more like when we were at teammate, how he was with his
[01:35:45] fellow team guys and peers in the way that we interacted with them. And then when we got out of
[01:35:49] the military, the way that he was. And, you know, we had friends and did all the things normal
[01:35:54] couples and families do. And then coming back and then being at the command for the first couple
[01:36:00] years, it was that way. And then slowly he just did less and less socially. He was a little more
[01:36:08] cut off. And then as it got farther along, he just was a little quieter. And, you know, the last
[01:36:16] year or two of his life, I'm, I'd sad. I'm like, gosh, I don't even know how much he smiled.
[01:36:27] Yeah. And no, um, no, no, him saying like, hey, I got to talk to somebody.
[01:36:34] No, no.
[01:36:46] Which, um, I mean, I, I'm guessing it's changing now. But I mean, that's the culture from
[01:36:53] buds, from basic seal training. Don't go to medical. Right? Don't go to medical. Don't talk
[01:37:01] to anybody. If you've got a stress for action, your leg, let it break. Don't go to medical.
[01:37:06] Hobble around as long as you can. Don't like that's, and again, it's not like anybody.
[01:37:11] Of course, what do the instructors say? Yep, go to medical. Check in if you've got it. If you're feeling
[01:37:14] but the, the culture is, and it's the same in every unit. It's, it's every unit. It's like this.
[01:37:21] I mean, and it's special operates every unit. It's every unit in the military.
[01:37:23] Lock it up. Don't say anything. Don't go to medical. Hand like you said, handle your shit.
[01:37:43] Yeah, I think the guys are just to, I, I, I don't know what they think. I don't know if they think
[01:37:49] maybe this is just me. Like, what's up with me? Am I fucked up? I don't want to tell my buddies. I'm
[01:37:54] might be a little fucked up. Or they don't want to hurt their service. Or they just want to
[01:38:00] ignore it and hope it'll go away. They think they'll just like muscle through it. I don't know what
[01:38:07] they think. But somehow we need to shift the little needle a little bit to recognize
[01:38:14] is you do all this training. I mean, millions of dollars are spent on these guys. You guys to
[01:38:22] train millions of dollars. And, you know, I mean, Chad was a sniper and free-falled jumpmaster and,
[01:38:28] you know, name all the things. And you took the time to teach him that.
[01:38:35] So why wouldn't you take the time to also teach them about maybe some ways that they're going to be
[01:38:42] potentially impacted after multiple years of service? It's 2021 and right now what we're about to
[01:38:50] see are people that have served their entire career post 911. So this suicide epidemic,
[01:38:59] it is not going away. It's only ramping up.
[01:39:04] Yeah, you know, when I, when I kind of started off talking about this, that's the connection that I
[01:39:09] made as I was like listening to your story hearing it is, you know, we've made all these developments
[01:39:15] and all these different wars from the problems that the wars cause, right? And yet, and I'd even
[01:39:21] talk about like, like, these current wars, the prosthetics, you see the prosthetics that people have
[01:39:26] now, they're amazing. You know, they can do all these incredible things. And we make these massive
[01:39:31] advancements. And yet, this is just like over here in this dark corner, not really being addressed.
[01:39:38] Now, I take that back. There is, there are things that are happening now that they are starting
[01:39:43] to address. I know that they're doing like baseline studies of guys. I don't know what you know about
[01:39:47] the stuff Jason, but they're doing like baseline studies, brain studies on guys, so they can kind of
[01:39:53] tell where they're at, so they can see what kind of impact they've had over over time. So I think
[01:39:58] maybe it is starting to come to light a little bit now. But certainly, I don't think the culture
[01:40:05] has a big change to it yet because, I mean, it takes time to offer to change culture.
[01:40:12] It would crush the recruitment process, wouldn't it? We've known for years because of history
[01:40:18] and wars that when you go serve your country, there's likely how do you could die? You're choosing
[01:40:23] to serve and die potentially by your flag, but it would really crush recruitment if insert army,
[01:40:33] navy, whoever. And you say, hey, you want to be a seal? You want to be a green beret? You want to be a
[01:40:40] and you say, you're going to come, you're going to do your service, you're going to do cool
[01:40:43] shit, you're going to jump out of airplanes, you're going to shoot guns and you're going to kill bad
[01:40:47] guys. And if you make it by the end of it, you might also have some pretty severe mental health issues
[01:40:53] and some brain injury. Are you going to go with that? It's hard for them to pony up and say that
[01:41:01] because, well, man, is that going to crush our number? I think people still show up for that.
[01:41:08] I mean, it's like, is everybody, when you do this, you're like, well, I'm going to happen to me.
[01:41:13] Oh, I know. I mean, I, I, other guys, not me. I did the cake of form before every
[01:41:21] deployment and I was fully prepared as you can be as a spouse in the world we were living in.
[01:41:30] I mean, we attended many funerals in those last 10 years that my husband might not come home.
[01:41:36] And if he doesn't come home, he's going to come home and a call from with the flag over it.
[01:41:40] That's not what I got. So where does it go towards the end? What do you
[01:42:05] see towards the end? One of the biggest things was, well, he started putting on weight and, you
[01:42:13] know, he would joke because he was over 40 and he's like, you don't love me anymore because I'm
[01:42:19] getting heavy, which would never be the case. But he started running weight, but what really
[01:42:25] started to happen and pretty drastically, I would say the last six months that I can look back
[01:42:30] now is he got really puffy. His face got puffy almost like the sounds terrible like,
[01:42:38] have you ever seen a fish in water instead and it's kind of like bloated? That's always face got.
[01:42:44] And, and I, he also is weird as this is, I would always kind of kiss him on his temple and he
[01:42:52] didn't smell the same. And I thought, oh, that's weird. Well, I've learned since then a lot more about
[01:43:02] the way the brain's affected and to go back to that kind of systemic derailment. When you have a
[01:43:11] blast injury, you know, it's, it's a wave, right? It goes through the air and basically your brain
[01:43:18] shakes up inside your skull and that's what it's built to do. That's why we have a skull and that's
[01:43:23] how it's made. But it's not made to get that over and over again. So when that happens and they're
[01:43:29] swelling in the brain, it then starts to affect everything else because the brain is connected to the
[01:43:35] rest of your body and you see where not only hormones get derail, but, you know, your metabolism gets
[01:43:44] jacked up. So the guy is start to gain weight and when your metabolism gets jacked up, it also messes with
[01:43:50] the ketones in your body which would be like, you know, factoring it with your urine and different
[01:43:55] things and that's what changes the way they smell. And the puffiness is because we'll sure if he's
[01:44:02] got brain injury and there's any swelling or there's just systemic swelling in the body,
[01:44:07] it's got to go somewhere and so we start to notice it in the face and again, I didn't know any
[01:44:15] of this stuff prior and that's not to say someone listening, you're sitting there and you look
[01:44:20] over at your husband. You're like, my husband's face is puffy, but there's something to be said
[01:44:26] that PTSD is a genuine thing. I believe I also believe it's overused a lot and this is a whole
[01:44:37] step further than PTSD. Well, and also you're talking about it's not just hey, your face is
[01:44:46] puffy, we have an issue. No, it's this, this, this, this, this, you add all these things together
[01:44:52] and you get that many red flags. Yeah. Then that's, you know, you've got the, the, the, the, the
[01:44:58] the, the, the, the, the, the, the, you smell different. Hey, you're not talking, hey,
[01:45:04] you know, you're, you're, you're, you're not working out as much as you should just start adding
[01:45:08] all these red flags together and it's like, okay, you know, we have, we have, we have to address this.
[01:45:14] Well, and, and when you think about the different parts of the brain, you've got your, your
[01:45:19] limbic brain, your monkey brain, deep inside, that's what tells you what's safe.
[01:45:23] Is this dangerous? Is this why we don't walk into the street, right? We know that's dangerous.
[01:45:27] The prefrontal cortex kind of is, hmm, how do I feel about that? So if, if the brain is affected,
[01:45:35] that's when we see them, you know, the short fuse, how do I feel, I'm angry, I'm aggressive,
[01:45:42] maybe I'm sad, different emotions, but when it's brain injury and we've heard CTE, right,
[01:45:48] punch drunk, NFL players, our guys get it too. Our guys are getting interface,
[01:45:54] astral glial scarring, and that's almost like think of like a ricochet, almost bullets through
[01:46:02] the brain, and that's what comes from the blast injury, and that's able to penetrate that deep
[01:46:08] monkey brain of like, is this safe for me? And that's why guys make decisions that are really,
[01:46:13] really bad, whether it's, you know, drinking too much, um, in fidelity or, you know, I have a friend
[01:46:23] who he's good now, but he had his daughter in the car and had been drinking and was
[01:46:34] speeding well far above the speed limit. Any father would know, none of that is good,
[01:46:43] but he wasn't able to make the right decision. So, so I started to see
[01:46:51] looking back, I can see how he had changed, and I've shared with Jason to Chad
[01:47:02] climbed Mount Auckland, Cogua in January and of 2018, and that's the second highest summit in
[01:47:10] the world. It's the highest in South America, it's in Argentina, and he went and climbed this,
[01:47:15] it's a little over 23,000 feet, and I will never know, but I do believe that him climbing that
[01:47:24] mountain exacerbated any of his brain injuries that he had, and I've since talked to
[01:47:36] a doctor who I respect highly. She's been studying blast injuries in Cosevo soldiers since the
[01:47:42] early 90s, or at least that's who she started with, and I asked her about that, and she,
[01:47:48] you know, again, she didn't test Chad's brain, but she was pretty confident that that was
[01:47:53] probably the case too. Yeah, I mean, how long was that? That's going to be a couple weeks at least
[01:47:59] of a three-week evolution. Yeah, and it was lack of a two-highly, stranyous. Yeah, and so now you've
[01:48:06] got this brain that's injured, what encourages healing in the body blood, blood flow, right? You
[01:48:13] have surgery, okay, cool, you need surgery, once you get up, once you move your knee, because we got
[01:48:18] to get blood flow to it, because we're going to heal, right? Brain's injured, wait, now I'm going to
[01:48:22] go up 23,000 feet, and I'm going to be without oxygen, it really needs to heal itself. Yeah,
[01:48:27] one of my, um, the guys go through the hyperbaric chamber, right, which is just O2, pressure O2.
[01:48:35] It's the opposite of climbing a 23,000 foot mountain, and it provides a lot of healing, a lot of healing
[01:48:41] to guys. So to have to do the opposite of that, I mean, it seems. I asked her about that, and she said,
[01:48:48] I said, is that something that would help, and she said, yes, but not initially after injury?
[01:48:53] I mean, we're talking different things, because you're talking about guys that've been back for a while,
[01:48:57] and we do see people who have a little bit exacerbated symptoms at a higher elevation. My
[01:49:07] best friend's husband, they live in Colorado, and I said to the doctor, I said, what would you say,
[01:49:14] if there was a 20 year Navy seal veteran who's done upwards of probably 10 deployments,
[01:49:22] without a doubt, probably does have some some brain blast injury and lives at 8 to 10,000 feet,
[01:49:31] and before I could even finish the sentence, she just shook her head, no, no, she's kept shaking her
[01:49:35] head, no, and she said, bad, bad, very bad. I'd tell him to move. What was Chad's,
[01:49:44] like debrief points on the mountain climb? What do you say about it? He said it was really hard,
[01:49:50] really hard. I think he was really proud of himself for doing it, but when he came home and walked
[01:49:59] in the door, I mean, he was so skinny, just, you know, what do you about lose 15, 20 pounds?
[01:50:06] Probably, and he came in, and he just said, baby, that was really freaking hard,
[01:50:13] and I just didn't really ever hear him say that about anything. Like, it was like, oh,
[01:50:18] well, you did it, you know, a good job, and he said, didn't always next.
[01:50:24] That was his plan. And when was that, that wasn't January of 2018? Yeah.
[01:50:33] And how about the interactions? Like, with the kids at this point, the family, like,
[01:50:39] is it, you notice, and more? Is it plateaued out?
[01:50:44] Well, at this point, it's with teenagers, and I remember saying to him,
[01:50:50] they don't even want to like hang out with us or be home, anything. And he's like,
[01:50:55] I don't want to hang out with my parents when I was 14, 17. We did take a family trip that June of
[01:51:04] 2018, we went to the Grand Canyon. And again, I look back at those pictures, and he definitely was not there.
[01:51:13] Like, he wasn't on the trip. You know what I mean? He was obviously there. But we stayed in a couple
[01:51:24] different cities. We kind of jumped around Arizona for a while, and you know, we're staying in this
[01:51:28] really nice hotel, and he didn't want to leave the room. You know, it's the Grand of its June and
[01:51:33] Arizona, so it is very, very hot. But, you know, he didn't really want to come down to the pool.
[01:51:38] He just wanted to sit in the room. And you're like, okay, but we're on a family vacation. And
[01:51:42] one time he was sitting down by the pool, and I saw him from a distance, and he just was kind of like
[01:51:51] leaned over in the chair, just like zoned in out. He was just not there. And I said, I walked up. I said,
[01:51:57] hey, what are you doing? He's like, nothing. Just, yeah, just things like that. He just wasn't,
[01:52:04] I don't know what he was thinking about. So where's the go from there?
[01:52:20] Well, and in the timeline? Yeah. Yeah. So he, he this year in 2018, I think, is when it started. He switched
[01:52:35] squadron, so he was moving around within the command. And he, he said that he didn't think that
[01:52:46] this is what he was supposed to be doing. I remember him saying, I just, I don't think this is right.
[01:52:51] I don't think this is really the path I'm supposed to be on. And again, he didn't really share a lot with me.
[01:52:57] And he, and I said, well, you're someone who's always accomplished every goal you've ever set for
[01:53:04] yourself. You make a goal. You go do it. So he had this goal for himself. He had, was in the process.
[01:53:11] I guess, of attaining the goal. And I said, maybe this is just the first time you change your mind.
[01:53:16] Like, you just don't want to do it. That's okay. You can, you can decide to change your mind. And
[01:53:21] he was like, well, they've spent so much time and money on, on doing this. And again, he didn't
[01:53:26] tell me any details. And he said he goes, I know I'm not really telling you much, but it makes me feel
[01:53:30] good to talk about it. And I was like, okay, because if he's gunna talk, I'm going to listen.
[01:53:34] And yeah, so something was bugging him. And I don't, I don't know what, but something was really
[01:53:43] bugging him. And at the beginning of October, he started hanging up his awards and things in the
[01:53:51] house, which he never did before. So we had, you know, like a lot of guys, he'll plaques and awards
[01:53:57] and he has a silver star and a maybe Marine Corps medal and a bronze star and all the things.
[01:54:05] And we had them all framed years ago, but he never hung them up. And he just thought it was really
[01:54:11] weird to hang that stuff up in your house. Because he said, what's someone's going to come in the house.
[01:54:16] And it's just like, look at me. And I always thought that was weird that he had to struggle with that.
[01:54:22] But yeah, he hung him up in our stairwell to our house. So maybe like you and your wife,
[01:54:30] marriage is a compromise, right? And I thought, you know, almost no one comes in our house anyway.
[01:54:37] And if someone were to come in our house, the only way they would see him is if they went up our stairs
[01:54:42] basically to our bedrooms. But in my mind, I just thought, well, at least he's hanging him up,
[01:54:47] so they're not going to get like broken or busted or anything. And he talked about hanging a
[01:54:54] Somali flag on one wall, what you would have seen when you come in the front door. And I just
[01:55:02] remember thinking, that's so weird. And I thought he was really messing with me. And when I turned
[01:55:09] around to kind of laugh, I realized he was serious. He was dead serious. And he was like, yeah, I guess that's
[01:55:14] dumb, huh? And I was like, well, maybe I asked him if he was okay. I remember kneeling down in
[01:55:23] front of Elman, I said, are you okay? And he said, yeah, okay. But if there was any sort of
[01:55:34] like first feeling, it was like he's off. I would have never thought three weeks later, he would
[01:55:42] take his life, but that's what happened. So it's interesting. And while I, I won't share
[01:55:50] her story, I, my other girlfriend will tell you who knew that her husband was struggling about
[01:55:59] two months prior. There was just like a switch. Two months and he was gone. So for me, I think it was
[01:56:07] three weeks and he was gone. I think they just meet this like threshold. And I don't know how we
[01:56:15] figure out where that is. That's going to be half to left to scientists. But, but there is some
[01:56:24] threshold that happens and then the switch is flipped. And it's still going to work. I mean,
[01:56:33] this, you kneeled down in front of them. You say, are you okay? He says, yeah, do you buy it?
[01:56:41] You want to buy it? I did buy it. And this again is one of those post-death struggles
[01:56:49] when someone takes their life, you military or not. You are left with so many questions. And I think
[01:56:56] that's, that's the beast to not have answers. And I believed him because there is nothing I didn't tell
[01:57:09] him. So I believed that if there was something he needed to tell me, he would tell me.
[01:57:20] And then he goes into work. Yeah. He went into work. He had a, he had a, he had a work trip three
[01:57:25] week before. This is when he gets really weird. So he had a work trip. And he could drive there.
[01:57:31] And he was supposed to come home on a Friday. And he called me on a Thursday. They had used
[01:57:35] rental cars to go up there. And he said, hey, I'm coming home early. Can you pick me up
[01:57:41] from the rental car place, forever? And I was like, oh, okay. And pick him up. He,
[01:57:49] we had to take her, I had to go get my son from a football game. So I drive him back home. And he
[01:57:57] instantly comes in the house. So Chad had been doing had had a concealed carry license. And he'd been
[01:58:03] roll him with a concealed carry, you know, when he's home around town for probably the last year or
[01:58:08] two. And again, I didn't really think much of it because I mean, well, crap is a team guy. And
[01:58:15] this is America. So we come home and he instantly goes to the safe and gets his gun. And I said,
[01:58:23] it was just kind of frantic. And I said, you realize that we're going on a school to pick up
[01:58:28] cuts. And he said, I'm not getting out of the car. And it was very like short. And I was like, okay.
[01:58:35] So we go, no big deal. In the whole time he's in the cities, just like, he just seemed uncomfortable.
[01:58:42] Um, I learned later that, and I don't know any details of whatever he was doing, but he was in a
[01:58:50] course, and he withdrew from the course. I he never quit anything. He never like stepped down from
[01:59:00] anything I'd ever known. So that conversation about, I'm not sure I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.
[01:59:07] That came later that night when he got home. And this was on a Thursday. And on Friday, I had to leave
[01:59:18] to go. I was working out in Raleigh. I could drive there for a seminar. Across it seminar. Yeah.
[01:59:25] And we talked about it that he needed to call his doctor because he felt like he just needed to check in,
[01:59:31] like maybe his testosterone was off. Maybe he's something. He's like, he wasn't feeling good.
[01:59:35] Earlier that week, he told me that he had some headaches and like some stomach aches. He had said he
[01:59:40] didn't feel good, which again, Chad never said. I mean, I don't know if ever he said, I don't feel good.
[01:59:47] I mean, he didn't say it like that, but he would never say that to me. But he did. He didn't feel good.
[01:59:51] And so the deal was when I left, he was going to make an appointment with his doctor and he was
[01:59:55] going to make an appointment to talk to his boss about whatever his work situation was to try to
[02:00:01] figure out what his path was going to be. And I left. I told our kids, hey, you know, dad's kind
[02:00:08] of stressed out just just saying, no, he's got a lot on his plate right now. And when I left,
[02:00:14] I'm leaving Virginia Beach and I just had this like gut and like pit in my stomach. Like I just
[02:00:19] felt like I shouldn't be leaving him. But I did. And went to Raleigh, worked, talked him on Saturday.
[02:00:30] And on Sunday, kids like called and said that dad's acting really weird and he's just laying
[02:00:37] on the landing and he's just staring at the ceiling. And I just, I just, that's just weird.
[02:00:50] That's just weird. And I was for his way and I had to work still full seminar and
[02:00:56] I just knew I had to get home. So the seminar finishes and I get in the car as quick as I can
[02:01:09] and try to raise home and he called me at one point and he just said, I love you. And I kind of
[02:01:16] laughed at him and I said, I love you too. And he's like, no, I mean, I really love you. I love you so much.
[02:01:23] I love you so much, Sarah. And he knew I loved it when he would say my name. And I said, you know,
[02:01:30] I love you too, but can I call you back? I really bad headache. And honestly, I was just really
[02:01:35] trying to get home. So fast forward a couple hours later, I get home and I go in the house and
[02:01:43] he's upstairs and he's rummaging below the bed for something and I come in and he turns to me
[02:01:50] and I hug him and kiss him and he kind of just like, like, collapses in my arms a little bit.
[02:02:00] So I just hug him for a second and I just think of my mind, well, I'm home now. So I'm near you.
[02:02:07] And I'm going to try to just, I didn't think at the time that I needed to necessarily keep you safe.
[02:02:13] I thought I just had to keep you close and make you feel better. And so I got, I had to get a shower
[02:02:22] and I said, come talk to me while I'm in the shower. And when I went around in the bathroom to start the
[02:02:26] shower, he wasn't right behind me and I looked out the door and he had just like collapsed like face
[02:02:32] first on the bed, kind of like the letter T, like arms out to the side, has his head just
[02:02:36] side like, like just exhaustion. And I said, what what are you doing? Come on, come in. And so I
[02:02:43] get in the shower and he's sitting on the bathtub and he just had been over and he's got his hands on
[02:02:50] either side of his head and he's holding this hair and he's kind of like gripping his hair and
[02:02:55] I kept saying what's wrong, you know, what's going on and he got to talk to me and he just kept
[02:03:01] saying I don't know. Anyway, I asked him to pass me a towel and he looked at me and he was not.
[02:03:13] He wasn't there. His eyes were just like, I was just like looking straight through his eyes.
[02:03:20] And I just lay down with him and bed and I just thought if I could keep him next to me then
[02:03:26] he would feel better. But that wasn't the case. So I woke up in the middle of the night and he was
[02:03:36] standing there dressed looking out the window and I said what are you doing? And he just said,
[02:03:43] I don't know. I said, well, come lay back and bed with me and he did and the next morning,
[02:03:52] early, I woke up. I woke up to see just him walking out the door. I saw like the back of his shoulder
[02:04:01] leave leave. And I, I, it's like I couldn't talk. It was like I couldn't get up. I don't know if it's
[02:04:11] just because I was sleepy or what or I wasn't really processing like, oh, he's leaving right now
[02:04:16] and then I couldn't find him. So I woke up, you know, a little while later I couldn't find him.
[02:04:25] So I looked around and I thought, well, maybe he went for a walk. Maybe he went for a run.
[02:04:31] Maybe he went to go get coffee. How did I call him? He didn't answer. I texted him. He didn't answer.
[02:04:38] And went round in my head trying to figure out where it could be. I got in my car at one point.
[02:04:44] I thought I'll drive around and then I thought, where am I? Where literally, like which direction would I drive?
[02:04:49] What's happening? Thought, well, did he leave for work? You supposed to leave on a work trip?
[02:04:54] But I figured he was also going to talk to his boss. So, you know, did he go to work? I just didn't know.
[02:05:01] I called his dad. But because he was so weird the night before I just thought it was weird that he left and he didn't
[02:05:07] say bye. He never didn't not kiss me goodbye. Never. He actually would do this. I'd be upstairs and he'd say,
[02:05:15] okay, bye. I'll see you later and he would slam a door in the house just to see me
[02:05:20] run down furiously down the steps because he knew I would get so spun up if he left and didn't kiss me.
[02:05:26] So, I don't know what I was thinking. I just know I wanted I just wanted confirmation of where he was
[02:05:40] and I finally called the command and I talked to the psych there and
[02:05:47] she asked me a bunch of questions. One of the questions she asked was how does he feel about
[02:05:57] and he asked he said chat's boss's name and I felt that was a really weird question
[02:06:06] because another thing I really loved about chat is he really never said anything bad about people.
[02:06:11] So, you know, if he liked you or didn't like you, I didn't really know. That's how he walked and
[02:06:19] I was like, I have no idea. But she, she just kind of let me think he's on his way to work.
[02:06:30] You know, like he's probably left and he's on the straining trip and a little while later I
[02:06:34] had talked to her again and I said, you know, everything's here. His toothbrush is here. His medicine
[02:06:39] is here. His sunglasses are here. He wouldn't leave with all that stuff and she told me
[02:06:46] due to the privacy of his job. It would be likely that he wouldn't be answering his cell phone.
[02:06:53] And I said, okay, so like the wife that I was, I kind of just thought, okay, so he must have gone
[02:07:03] and it was driving trip up the coast a little bit. So I thought, okay, he was supposed to be back the next day
[02:07:07] and so I think about that and my kids came home from school that day and they said, where's dad?
[02:07:20] And I said, oh, I don't know. I think he left on this work trip. He should be home tomorrow. And I'm
[02:07:24] saying that almost feeling like I'm lying because I don't believe it. But I'm trying to believe it
[02:07:29] because that's what I was told and why wouldn't you, right? So this point, you know, he disappears
[02:07:40] Monday morning, probably I'm saying somewhere between three and six AM and Monday goes by,
[02:07:49] we started demolition on our house. We were doing renovations. That started that day and Tuesday
[02:07:55] comes and I went my house sits near a lake. You can see it from my front porch and I went for a run
[02:08:05] and this is why I'm sharing it. It'll make sense in a minute. But I went for a run and I ran past the
[02:08:10] lake down the bike path all around and I was going to sit at the lake from an end of October.
[02:08:15] It's Virginia Beach. The weather was really beautiful that day and I was going to sit on the bench
[02:08:20] at that lake. But I didn't because I wanted to go inside and shower and like curl my hair and look
[02:08:26] nice for winning at home. So I did that and dropped my son off at a friend's house. He's going to play
[02:08:34] going to a football game. And as I was pulling back in, a psych from work called and said,
[02:08:39] ma'am, your husband didn't report to a master. We're heightening the alert. And I said, that's bad.
[02:08:47] That's bad. That's very bad. And I pretty sure I hung up the phone on him. And when I got out of my car,
[02:08:53] so now where my car was, it's in this coldest acne or buy and it's facing that lake and my house
[02:09:02] is on the left and as I'm walking up to my house, the head contractor for the renovations comes out
[02:09:07] and he says, ma'am, there's two police officers at your back door.
[02:09:11] I called my best friend Courtney, her husband and my husband were in Buds together. And I said,
[02:09:26] you need to come to my house right now. And I just hung up phone. And I didn't know what was going
[02:09:35] on. I just thought something is like seriously. And I went in my front door and out my back door
[02:09:41] the way the house is and there were two cops in my garage and they were, we stood outside the door
[02:09:47] and they said, ma'am, do you know where your husband is? And I said, no, I can't find him and I haven't
[02:09:54] been able to find him. And I asked him if they could move farther down into the street because we were
[02:09:59] right underneath my daughter's window and I knew that she was upstairs and I just didn't want her to be.
[02:10:06] I just didn't know what was happening. So we moved on to the street and
[02:10:18] this cop just opens his door and he like dig something and I have this car and he just turned
[02:10:25] the police. And he said, ma'am, I'm really sorry to tell you but we found your husband and he took his life.
[02:10:35] And now is all alone.
[02:10:42] So, right, right.
[02:10:44] I ran about that time. Courtney pulled up. Sorry. Sorry.
[02:10:59] Courtney pulled up and I think I was screaming and she bare hugged me from behind and I think
[02:11:06] we pretty much took her to the ground, I think. And she said, you don't know that. So she screamed at him.
[02:11:13] You don't know that. Well, he's taken his life at that lake and he could see her house from where he was.
[02:11:23] At least that's what they tell me. So, my daughter's upstairs in her room by herself and she can see
[02:11:37] in here everything. And my son is at a friend's house and I think pretty sure my neighbor went to pick him up.
[02:11:47] So he told me son. So, I have to understand like logistically speaking, there's a lot of things that just
[02:12:07] don't make sense. Where my car was when I got out of it and that guy said the cops were at the back door.
[02:12:20] If they had just found his body, I didn't see anybody over by that lake.
[02:12:26] It had been like 36 hours since I couldn't find them. We went back later and I do think he was at the lake.
[02:12:44] And this is why we went back later in our neighborhood so many people have cameras on their house
[02:12:50] and there's footage of Chad and the bike path that lines that lake if you walk to it at kind of T's and if you go left
[02:13:01] it takes you all the way up to the main road that cars go in and out of the neighborhood. And I think we timed it so that
[02:13:10] cameras caught him walking that way and that would have been right at the same time he would have watched our kids leave for school.
[02:13:27] So, when um, when this is happening, when this is getting like, when when when
[02:13:39] he leaves in the morning and you start thinking like where is he? Is there any part of your brain that's thinking
[02:13:46] he could kill himself? No. So, well, I take that back.
[02:13:51] I did ask Chad's dad. I was trying to get into the safe. So, I guess there was a part of me that did but
[02:14:10] this, he, this was a little farther on in the morning. So, when I first couldn't find him I just
[02:14:14] couldn't find up in the napkin or a while, I think it might have been his dad that said have you checked the
[02:14:19] safe? And so, it took me a minute to try to remember the combo and I got in there and to my knowledge
[02:14:29] all the guns were there but apparently they weren't. I guess the reason I'm asking you that is because
[02:14:39] I don't know various conversations in my, I've had in my life with various people at various times
[02:14:45] and the conversation is something like, you know, you know, that little exploration of
[02:14:54] wait, I'm worried about him and then there'll be some kind of an explanation like,
[02:15:00] what do you mean? Well, I'm just worried like he might kill himself and then the conversation is
[02:15:08] he would never do that. Right? So, that idea of we think we know, we think we know what someone's
[02:15:19] going through, we think we know what's going on in their heads and I think that we don't know,
[02:15:26] we don't always know and, you know, like, he disappears, you know, like what, that's what I was
[02:15:34] just thinking like, what was that in your head of like, hey, you know what, he's, you know, he
[02:15:40] probably is going to see his parents or he's, you know, going to go freaking surfing or whatever he's
[02:15:45] going to do but this crazy idea that he might go kill himself. It seems so unbelievable, you know,
[02:15:59] for someone that's like, hey, he's been through whatever, 10 deployments. He's done all this.
[02:16:03] He's done this. He's done that. We got kids. We got a house. We got all these things going on. All these
[02:16:07] good things going on in our lives. That's not, that's not going to happen. And it seems like
[02:16:14] oftentimes people are caught off guard by it. People are caught off guard and I know you mentioned a
[02:16:21] couple of friends where there was real signs of, you know, hey, not things aren't going good for
[02:16:28] the individual but a lot of times I hear it's like, you know, there's been some suicides in the
[02:16:34] seal community where there was no indication at all, at all of any kind. And it seems like we're
[02:16:47] conditioned to sort of not even think that it's a feasible thing. I, guilt. I, you know, I was just as bad as,
[02:17:07] as the military makes the guys out to be because as I said in his funeral,
[02:17:15] to me, Chad was unbreakable. I mean, to me, he had done all these really amazing things in
[02:17:28] his life. He, he's, you know, he, everything he did, he did well, everything he did. And
[02:17:38] it's seal, you know, great ridiculous high GPA when he's going night school and he has a life and a
[02:17:45] baby and really good in sniper school and went and got his project manager license certification,
[02:17:52] all that in the business world. And whatever, fill in the blank, climbing mountains,
[02:17:59] qualifying for the CrossFit games, like insert whatever, he just was so unbreakable to me. And,
[02:18:07] and I guess that's part of my, what I want people to recognize with your person is that
[02:18:17] they are, they're Navy seals, but at the end of the day, you're just dudes, you know, your dudes,
[02:18:23] and humans, and with heart and conscience and dads and husbands and brothers and sons and, um,
[02:18:37] not unbreakable.
[02:18:43] So, I'm a book written by a guy named David Hackworth who is a Vietnam Korean War veteran and one of
[02:18:50] the things that he talks about is the fact that like people are different, right? And as you mentioned,
[02:18:55] people are different and something's in fact different people different ways and he described like
[02:19:00] there's a cop that people have and, and when it gets filled up with like the stress and the trauma,
[02:19:08] once it overflows like that's it. If you, if it overflows, that's it, like you, that's it. And
[02:19:15] different people have different sized cops and some people got a freaking five gallon jug and some
[02:19:20] people got a tea cup and everything in between and I compare that to another war veteran, Dick Winners,
[02:19:29] who is the character of Bandar Brothers, he was saying that, but he's got a book about about war as well
[02:19:37] and his big thing was like, when that cop, they use a different metaphor, but
[02:19:42] when the cop starts to get filled up, you need to get the person out of a situation and if you
[02:19:49] get him out of the situation, the cop like the the water will dissipate and it'll go back down
[02:19:56] and they can continue, they can go back, they can continue to perform their job. But same thing,
[02:20:01] if you let the cop overflow, then it's, it's, it's, can't you can't put the water back in there.
[02:20:08] You know, I always talk, when I talk to people about this kind of stuff, I talk about the
[02:20:13] check engine light in a car, right? If the check engine light comes on, you take it in for a service.
[02:20:19] You stop driving it and as long as you take it in for a service and it gets some downtime
[02:20:24] and the engine cools and you put in fresh oil, whatever the engine is going to be okay.
[02:20:29] But if the check engine light comes on and you just keep running that engine,
[02:20:32] you're going to burn that engine out and you'll destroy the engine. And you know, I think that
[02:20:40] all these things come into play and that's what makes this so difficult is everyone's just got
[02:20:45] a different size cup and everyone's got a different time that they're check engine light comes on
[02:20:50] and how much it's going to take to get that thing cooled back down and it makes it, it makes it so
[02:20:55] challenging to universally say, okay, well here's the limitation that people have. So I think what
[02:21:02] you're doing, talking about how to identify that check engine light so people can see it.
[02:21:10] And then also trying to help people to recognize that you've got to kind of, you've got to do
[02:21:18] your best to see your own check engine light and when that freaking thing comes on,
[02:21:22] you've got to do something about it. And if you don't do something about it,
[02:21:25] you're going to blow out the engine and then you're no good.
[02:21:27] Yeah, and as we've said a couple times that the guys don't want to worry the spouse or I say
[02:21:37] spouse or first responder like who's who is your go-to person, right? They don't want to worry the
[02:21:43] spouse, but if I were to ask someone that was struggling right now, maybe they're sitting there
[02:21:51] and they're they thought about taking their life and they say, I don't want to bother my spouse. I don't
[02:21:56] I would it would be better for her if I wasn't here and I can't speak to the relationships that
[02:22:02] people have, but sitting on this side of it, sorry, I didn't like total cry or today.
[02:22:11] He didn't even give me the chance to help. That hurts. So it's on one hand you can say,
[02:22:22] well he didn't want to burden you, you know, he just he didn't want to cause you any worry,
[02:22:29] but I mean look at where I am now. Did he not think that this wouldn't like devastate me forever?
[02:22:36] He didn't even give me the opportunity to like try to help.
[02:22:41] You know, Jacob, the hard part comes in when you've got guys who you're your bread not to talk about this
[02:22:51] stuff. It is constantly bread and the interesting part for me in this journey of learning
[02:22:59] Chad's story and my wife Emily and I get into to know Sarah and her family really well and
[02:23:04] going really into this issue is there's actually something that happens to your brain, right? This
[02:23:11] is not something where it's not like, oh, you know, I've just got this inexplicable weakness going on
[02:23:21] because that's what it is in the teams, right? It's like, oh that dude's weak if he goes and does this.
[02:23:27] And you know, but if you blow your back out or if you, you know, you get shot or if you do,
[02:23:34] you know, things that are acceptable injuries, you know, by team room standards of sorts, right?
[02:23:43] And the thing that's like, my best friend and basic training killed himself and I didn't unpack
[02:23:49] that at all, right? I mean his dad was a general and that was something that in my training,
[02:23:56] it's just, you know, I couldn't sit and think about this at all. It's like days of thunder, right?
[02:24:03] When, you know, coal gets, Tom Cruise gets injured, right? I mean the injured driver goes way over there
[02:24:10] and nobody ever wants to be around them. And for me personally, I had to just kind of take that and say,
[02:24:16] all right, I have a job to do and he was weak. Good friend of mine and he just, that's that could happen
[02:24:23] to him and there's something, what I told myself was there's something that he was born with
[02:24:29] that made him do that and this just kind of brought it to life. And when you hear Chad's story,
[02:24:35] if you think that you didn't hear the story, because, you know, that's the word of caution to the
[02:24:41] guys and our profession and to millions of Americans out there, right? The, this idea that
[02:24:49] you're born with this or you're not, I mean situation brought this, brought this out, right?
[02:24:55] It's chronic stress, chronic pain going on from injuries and just the way that you train,
[02:25:02] the way that, I mean it takes its toll and then that leads to all sorts of things and, you know,
[02:25:08] the brain is something that we don't really study that well. We don't study it much at all and,
[02:25:13] you know, it's one of those things where we're able to, you know, cure this virus almost a year
[02:25:19] later with a huge national surge because we give a shit in the matters and this is something
[02:25:25] that is just kind of still floating around over here. I mean, what's it going to take? We're losing
[02:25:31] our, some of our most valuable people in our country, right, to, to something that we just don't
[02:25:38] understand. But what I know, my mental shift is to say there wasn't one that of weakness in Chad
[02:25:43] Wilkinson. There was something that is inexplicable that we just have not explained yet that,
[02:25:49] that changed inside of him and some decision-making process, you know, it just, it changed
[02:25:57] and we have a long ways to go. Yeah, there's a famous football player from San Diego,
[02:26:02] a guy named Junior Sayow, have you heard of him? Oh yeah, like the most beloved, probably San Diego
[02:26:09] charger, maybe even the most beloved San Diego athlete, total stud, you know, a beast of a human,
[02:26:18] like a super nice guy. He was just, just this incredible human being. He returned from the
[02:26:23] NFL and killed himself. Like he had everything and, you know, that, that, that made me think of this,
[02:26:32] you know, Sarah, when you're like talking about Chad and when I've talked to people that,
[02:26:40] like our art depressed, straight up depressed, their heads in, in like this, their heads in a
[02:26:49] storm, their heads in like darkness and, and it's really like from the outside,
[02:26:55] you look at him and you think, oh yeah, well, hey, man, it's, you know, you're in this bad situation,
[02:26:59] but it's only, it's only just right around you and if you come over here a little bit,
[02:27:03] you'll be out of the storm, like, come on over, but from their perspective, no matter where they look,
[02:27:10] it's like darkness and they just see the storm and they don't see that if they can move forward
[02:27:16] more, they can go a little bit further and they don't see that everybody's on the outside going,
[02:27:21] hey, like, it's okay, man, it's super sunny and bright and like there's a rainbow over here and
[02:27:26] everything's cool, just, just, just move over here a little bit and they can't, they, they don't see it,
[02:27:33] they don't see it, they can't see it, they can't see it because it's there, that's what they're,
[02:27:36] that's what's around them and so like, it just causes them to do things that don't make any sense to
[02:27:42] us because we're looking at him from the outside going, hey, like, no, it's sunny, it's sunny,
[02:27:47] and they can't see it and it's like trying to convince people, it's almost impossible, it seems
[02:27:55] almost impossible to try and convince someone that that storm that they see 360 degrees around them,
[02:28:03] thunder, lightning, winds, that's what they see and to convince them that hey, man, right over here,
[02:28:11] it's sunny and it's nice beach day and it's 80 degrees and we're gonna, it's okay,
[02:28:18] they, they can't see it and it's so hard to get them out of that cloud and
[02:28:25] I think that's where people get stuck and it's so frustrating from the outside because
[02:28:34] we can see all that other good stuff that they just don't have the ability to see anymore.
[02:28:38] So I think it's like a combination, you know, you got like I said, Junior say, I'll
[02:28:43] what better life could that guy have set up for himself? You know, he's got
[02:28:48] everything that a person could want and yet he's in this cloud and it consumes him.
[02:28:55] I mean, so to Chad, right? I mean, I exact great family, great life, he had respect, hit honor,
[02:29:02] you know, everything, it doesn't get better than that, right? I mean, that's the
[02:29:07] currency when you're in that line of line of work. You just want, you want to be respected and
[02:29:13] you want them to think, oh, he's doing a good job and you know, you look at, you look at where
[02:29:20] he went and what he did, he had that and when you can't see it, there's just something else going on.
[02:29:28] Absolutely. And so when you kind of look at that, I mean, you know, it's like, what's the
[02:29:34] responsibility moving forward, right? I mean, there's some command responsibility. I'm not
[02:29:38] sitting here pointing fingers backwards. I'm sitting saying like, you know, part of what we want to do
[02:29:43] is educate the next, the next crop and I know you're huge on this as well and I mean,
[02:29:50] the hardest thing to do sometimes is it takes someone out of the game. So like, you know,
[02:29:55] we started this in football, you've got the concussion, measurements and if you get a concussion,
[02:30:00] you've got to come out and you know, if it's your star player, he's still got to come out.
[02:30:04] And you start to look at like, how are we doing this in the military, you know? We kind of say
[02:30:11] the military's not a social experiment because it's not. But the truth of the matter is is that
[02:30:17] when you get into these, especially units like DevGrew and Delta and SF, right? I mean,
[02:30:23] your job is to go win wars. I mean, this is not, that requires, I mean, the American Alpha male
[02:30:30] is very special kind of thing in the history of history and it requires a special type of training,
[02:30:38] it requires all sorts of things that make it very difficult to stop them from wanting to keep
[02:30:47] going after that. You just, you, it's like we're breeding it into them. So like you take American
[02:30:51] Alpha males and you make them more alpha. I mean, it's, it's quite impressive and you create these
[02:30:57] units. I mean, they're story units. I mean, DevGrew, SEAL Team 6, I mean, the SEALs, these are, these are,
[02:31:05] you know, it's very impressive. And so how do we, how do we protect the guys though?
[02:31:13] And I say this from a two-way street, you know, it's one thing is here and say, oh, you know,
[02:31:18] we got to know that if we're not sleeping well that there's something wrong and that's going to be a problem.
[02:31:22] Like, okay, I'm like, I'm like, I'm on a team on my get. Got it, right? Take another pill. Right?
[02:31:27] Work out a little harder. Maybe I'll sleep better. Yeah, good. You know? And it's like,
[02:31:32] that's not going to work. Right? It's not going to work. It's at some point we have to, we have to
[02:31:38] put more of a systematic approach in here to mental health. We've done that in SF, right? I mean,
[02:31:45] they're starting to treat green berets like professional athletes, which is great. You know,
[02:31:49] you've got a locker room, you've got, you know, the physical trainers, you get physicals, you get
[02:31:53] checked up, you get all these things. And you know, if we don't, then it's too much of the loss is in vain.
[02:32:01] Yeah, no, and they definitely are moving in that direction in the teams and the
[02:32:06] seal teams, like the baseline studies that they're doing. They are absolutely moving that direction.
[02:32:12] I mean, they have whole organizations within the organization that are focused on that. And yeah,
[02:32:20] I mean, their lessons have definitely been learned. That's great. I mean, Chad killed himself
[02:32:26] three years ago. Yeah. Like they were not moving. We're not moving fast enough. Here. I mean,
[02:32:30] the VA, you know what the budget is for veterans who saw I prevention, it's 10.2 billion.
[02:32:34] Wow. That's a big number. That is a big number. Right? And, you know, the VA gets just
[02:32:42] shit on all over the place, right? The VA is actually trying. I mean, if you look at budget,
[02:32:48] they're some trying, they're they're trying experimental stuff, anti-depressant nasal spray, right?
[02:32:55] Virtual reality-based suicide prevention training. I mean, these kinds of things, they are,
[02:33:00] there are things that we are trying. We as it a nation. And it's, at some point, you know,
[02:33:11] the guys that are close to the guys and, and gals, I don't want to exclude the female service
[02:33:19] members either because it affects them as well. I mean, you're actually statistically more likely
[02:33:24] to commit suicide if you did not deploy than if you did.
[02:33:27] Explain that again. So, if you did not, I mean, it's saying, you know, just because you were
[02:33:37] on seal team six or just because you saw intense combat, right? That's not a predictor of suicide.
[02:33:44] So, it might be a predictor of, you know, TBI and those kinds of things because, you know,
[02:33:50] if all you do is explosive breach charges next to doors all day long, I mean, you know, commanders
[02:33:55] have to figure out a way to limit that stuff. Like you can only do this so many times. I got it.
[02:34:01] You don't want the first one to be on, you know, the, the house down range. You have to work with
[02:34:06] live explosives. But, but at the same time, you can't, you can't just go through the same
[02:34:12] repetitions a million times. And, you know what I mean? The other part is you have your, your team
[02:34:18] time and you roll off a team and there's always guys behind you. And, and this is credit to America
[02:34:25] first off and credit to just who we are, we sign up when we say send me. And, and there's a lot of
[02:34:31] us that that answer that when you're on that, when you're living that life and you're on these
[02:34:37] deployments doing this cool stuff, you don't want to miss any of it. You're like, this is my slot.
[02:34:43] Nobody's coming in behind me and, you know, Sarah, you told me this. You're like, you know,
[02:34:47] in the truth of the matter, there's, there's a lot more seals right behind you. And so,
[02:34:52] commanders have this at their, at their discretion. They have this, this ability to kind of
[02:34:57] how do we, we can take a look back now, right? Remove all the politics about, you know, the
[02:35:02] wars are ending. Well, the wars aren't going to end for the tier one units ever, right? But, at
[02:35:07] the same time, we have an operational, we're not cool. There's less going on. There's less work.
[02:35:14] And we have this ability to kind of reset a little bit the way that we're, the way that we're approaching
[02:35:19] this. Yeah. Yeah. Well, this kind of conversation right here is a thing that can hopefully
[02:35:26] move this in the right direction. And I know that's the main reason that you're sitting here today
[02:35:32] is to try and move this in the right direction. And, and you're actually, when let's talk about
[02:35:39] how you're doing that, let's talk about, you know, the actual charities and stuff that you guys
[02:35:44] are doing to try and ways or what raise awareness. Yeah. So, the one thing Jason and I are
[02:35:50] partnered on is the workout and honor of my husband. We refer to it as Chad 1,000 X. Again,
[02:35:57] I spoke about this at his funeral. As he prepped it, he climbed that mountain. He did it by doing
[02:36:03] step-ups on a box and he did it on a 20-inch box with a 45-pound pack working up to a thousand
[02:36:10] over a period of time. And then once he got there, then he would just like pump out a thousand every
[02:36:15] couple days. Chad was super disciplined. He was incredibly focused and every goal that he had. And
[02:36:23] that's definitely something that I'm trying to have live within me. This workout I talked about
[02:36:31] it as funeral and so more or less organically kind of just became a thing. Right? Dave was there.
[02:36:38] CrossFit friends were there. Dave Castro was there. Yeah. And they just did it on their own
[02:36:44] just because they thought, oh, challenge, right? That's cool. A thousand step-ups, 45, you know, man stuff.
[02:36:49] Let's do it. And then fast forward. I'll stop you there. I won't speak for Dave, but I will say,
[02:36:58] Dave knew Chad. They served, they served together. And he doesn't know how to process that.
[02:37:04] You know? I mean, he doesn't know how to process the loss of a friend,
[02:37:07] especially to suicide. And so, you know, he's trying to do, it is amazing how many people want to
[02:37:13] help. How many people this is affected? I mean, Chad's life ripple effects huge, but everybody has this,
[02:37:22] there's some, this, this epidemic has touched so many people and nobody knows how to deal with it.
[02:37:29] Nobody knows how. I mean, my supposed to do 22 pushups and from my, you know, phone and and publish it on
[02:37:34] social media. I mean, is that helping? 22 is not the number. Right. That's not even an accurate number.
[02:37:41] It's 17 now, which is, which is better. You know, it's just so many people want to want to help.
[02:37:48] So I think, you know, Dave, for his part, I mean, I know he, he wanted to honor Chad and, you know,
[02:37:56] I think he wanted other people to honor Chad as well. And that's, yeah. So, so we established Chad
[02:38:05] 1,000 X into an annual fundraiser. And there, there are many spouses like myself, Goldstar
[02:38:14] spouses, and they've gone on and there's golf tournaments and there's five keys and there's the
[02:38:18] like and they raise money for different organizations. This workout specifically, we want
[02:38:24] around veterans day because while it's Chad's face and I have kind of stepped into the role of
[02:38:33] sharing his story for me, it has less to do with with Chad Wilkinson and more to do about the
[02:38:41] struggle that our veterans currently have. And so why not really focus this around veterans day
[02:38:48] when that's what we're doing, honoring those serving and create a platform for them to talk to
[02:38:53] one another. We did this last year and it was kind of a late rollout and we're like, let's just
[02:39:00] like do this and see what happens and very we really had no expectation and I can't even express how
[02:39:08] humbled we were by the response and I mean it, it went global and went around the world. People
[02:39:15] people did this workout. I think the beauty of it is anybody can do this workout because a step
[02:39:25] up is not technical, we're not snatching, there's no muscle ups that you know anybody can do a step
[02:39:31] up and then obviously we scale it and you know you have this huge fitness background, you're
[02:39:38] well aware not everyone has to do the 20 inch box not everybody has to do that weight but being able
[02:39:44] to go do a workout and honor of someone in our military that that generally brings people together
[02:39:54] anyway because they want to kind of pay their humble respects but the potential that it could bring
[02:40:02] for people to have a conversation whether it's you're doing the step ups and maybe you start to
[02:40:08] realize in that hour time frame where your brain does go what do you think about you know
[02:40:14] your struggle the person you're doing it for the friend you lost do you do it with a friend
[02:40:20] and you guys can talk to each other well I think Jason and I have confirmed that once you get
[02:40:25] to probably about 500 you don't really talk anymore but the idea of doing it with a friend
[02:40:32] the symbolism there is to me everybody needs somebody. Have you put together technical
[02:40:40] question here have you put together like a ramp up program for people to do you know two months out
[02:40:47] do a hundred and then whatever break it down like you know those marathon programming things
[02:40:53] where yeah there's working the program yeah yeah and so you know part of the the bigger
[02:41:00] message here is you know I've never met the guy that I served with ever who said man I'm really looking
[02:41:08] forward to going to that shrinks office with the waterfall in the background and it's really quiet
[02:41:12] and let's go talk about feelings but I've never met that I've never met that person right especially
[02:41:17] from our community well have you heard a night go Chad went okay do you want to know how I feel about
[02:41:25] it sure I mean I've I've talked to a lot of guys I went to it that thought it was awesome
[02:41:32] and I don't know when Chad went December 2016 and we went to years he was dead if I found seven
[02:41:38] TBIs on his brain and they laughed what do you mean that wasn't very many one of the guys we were
[02:41:44] with have 42 he made a joke he said yeah I got to walk around with Vupal helmet because I can't
[02:41:49] risk falling over the guy you know I mean they can joke among each other but it's just like
[02:41:53] seven TBIs so that wasn't very many but you know what you can't find on all those screens
[02:41:59] CTE or interface astroglovescarring so you know I am of I am an advocate of whatever you find
[02:42:10] works if that works for you do it 100% I believe it feel it live it but I am not convinced by any
[02:42:24] military centered organization that they're really doing any sort of good yet and I don't know if
[02:42:34] they just want to talk about it and not be about it but less than two years later Chad was dead
[02:42:42] and you know you do all the things I mean there there is a lot of assessment that happens at that
[02:42:46] place and could be potentially good it told me almost all the things I already knew about him as a spouse
[02:42:57] I are you know they did personality tests and different stress tests and I mean yes I don't know
[02:43:04] the scientific sleep lab study but I could tell you his sleep is shit they did a test where they are
[02:43:12] trying to realize are you the guy that's gonna I'm trying to figure the best way they said this
[02:43:17] basically are you the guy that's gonna see a problem and respond right away like rapid fire like
[02:43:22] bull in a china shop are you the guy that's gonna like take a minute assess it and you're not going
[02:43:27] to be very fast but it's gonna be methodical and it's gonna be perfect well that's Chad if you would have
[02:43:31] ever watched him pack a car for a family trip that's Chad so all the things that they did there you know
[02:43:38] I don't feel like it gave me any more insight than I already had and I'm not so sure that's the
[02:43:46] case for Chad I mean and they do art therapy and they do dog therapy and they do music therapy
[02:43:53] and I mean even them making him walk a dog he finally said to him hey man I'll do whatever you want
[02:43:59] me to do but I'm not walking this damn dog he's probably one of the few team guys that like he
[02:44:03] didn't like dogs so yeah if it works for people and they got something out of it great but the
[02:44:11] way I see it is it's a way for the guys to go fat in their medical records so they can punch the
[02:44:15] ticket on where their medical disability lies which to be totally frank as a spouse every single
[02:44:21] one of those dudes should be a hundred percent disabled yeah no I I never went to it it wasn't I don't
[02:44:28] think it was it was in existence maybe but I never went to it but I do know a lot of guys that went
[02:44:33] to it that got a lot out of it and part of what they got out of it yeah they're looking at
[02:44:37] their medical record but you know they're I mean just the the decompression aspect of it
[02:44:42] meaning for 30 days like you're just gonna eat nice food and like not do anything not
[02:44:49] blown anything up or whatever there was and and guys felt I definitely know some guys that got
[02:44:54] a lot out of going to it clearly there's some shortfalls especially if they find issues and
[02:45:02] they're like oh yeah this is no factor that seems kind of crazy but yeah you mentioned that
[02:45:06] CTE thing because they can't they can't CTE follow your alive right it's post mortum so
[02:45:12] same thing interface out of school of scarring right now there is no test for it so to some degree
[02:45:19] those guys out there that has served multiple deployments and know you have some TBI's
[02:45:24] you might want to almost assume that that could be in there what what I think could be a great
[02:45:33] way and an extension of service for some of our military as this cakeo form we fill out
[02:45:38] before the guys deploy and for listeners it's it's it's it's it's it's a form we fill out
[02:45:48] that basically says what's gonna happen should your husband get killed or or wife your spouse
[02:45:53] gets killed and everything from who's gonna show a pet your door are they gonna weather
[02:45:57] uniform is it military honors are they buried are they cremated who's gonna take your kids all
[02:46:02] all those you know pretty important questions it's kind of sad that when you fill it out so many
[02:46:09] times it's commonplace I remember the first time I filled it out we mold over these questions
[02:46:14] for so long and and by the end of the deployments I mean I'm like making dinner and I'm like oh yeah
[02:46:19] that's fine yep that's fine wait change that because she moved and she's not gonna be able to get
[02:46:23] here in time so make it this person I mean that's how it is but and there's there is some there is
[02:46:31] gonna be some limitations and I don't know what they are but we were able to donate Chad's brain
[02:46:35] because he he was state side and you have to do it probably within 48 to 72 hours I'm not quite
[02:46:42] sure with the time frame is and his brain was studied and that's how we were able to determine
[02:46:47] that he did have that and I don't know if it would be applicable if you're overseas because of
[02:46:53] travel time etc but if you were to add that on the cakeo form that if you were killed you would
[02:46:59] like your brain donated this is in no way to encourage anybody to take their life by any means
[02:47:08] but either way if you're a team guy and and you get in a car accident and you die fill in the
[02:47:15] blank if you could also put on there or at least have a conversation with your person that you
[02:47:21] also want your brain donated that would be a great extension of service I think that's a straightforward
[02:47:31] ask I mean yeah the straightforward ask brain study is kind of a big it's a big topic in
[02:47:37] those circles right now there there's so many elements that go into this but you know there's
[02:47:42] the two places where the brain's really being studied right now are China and Japan and Europe
[02:47:49] you know they're just protests on chimpanzees excuse me and so you know because they're the closest
[02:47:54] to the the best way to study the brain is while it's working you know you can't make sense right
[02:48:01] and so you know we have issues doing that here with chimpanzees you know they're they're
[02:48:08] chasing off the European equivalent of pedas chasing off you know scientists from Europe they're
[02:48:15] they're just setting up shop in China and so like yeah we're gonna we're gonna graph this brain you know
[02:48:20] and so there's a lot of there's a lot of challenges that we will we will face what what we do
[02:48:28] know is that mass veteran suicide is not a thing guys don't all get together and kill themselves at
[02:48:35] the same time what we need we need to create communities with with bonds of people that were
[02:48:42] able to take some of the lessons that that Sarah's bravely sharing with us and and so many behind
[02:48:49] or behind and around her are sharing about their journey what they've seen we need to strengthen
[02:48:54] the community so that we're able to kind of watch after each other because the military has a
[02:48:59] stronger social fabric than pretty much anywhere and in sort of normal you know middle America or
[02:49:08] anywhere America right and still you're your 1.5 there's a lot of different statistics but you're
[02:49:13] 1.5 times more likely to take your life if you're in the military than if you're not and it's just you
[02:49:20] know how is this happening like how is this okay well it's not okay and so what we're trying to
[02:49:26] do and what we are doing is bringing people together in the real world not in a shrinks office
[02:49:31] with the waterfall you know that you don't want to be there and it's like hey you know physical health
[02:49:36] mental health somehow those are definitely we don't have to study chimpanzees to know that those
[02:49:41] are definitely tied together and obviously Chad did not suffer from physical you know like he could
[02:49:48] do a thousand step ups just fine and climb mountains and stuff but you know all these things you know
[02:49:52] you're not sleeping well great work out you know you talk about this all the time jocco right you know
[02:49:59] and and so bring people together yes think about this and so it was really telling when we did
[02:50:04] this in Virginia Beach and and guys it chatted served with showed up you know quietly kind of
[02:50:09] did the work you know they showed up in the big f9 50s you know it's like just awesome this is
[02:50:17] America god bless us right and you know they showed up and if this was a group counseling session
[02:50:24] to talk about you know the mandatory briefs away nobody's showing up for that stuff but you show
[02:50:29] up and you do the work in honor of you know to honor Chad's life and to think about veteran
[02:50:35] suicide prevention to think about this unbreakable guy right I mean go ask anybody in the navy
[02:50:40] that go on to be a seal do you want Chad's career they're like yes that's I want that to be me and
[02:50:47] you got guys showing up and you know there there's some community around it you know everyone's
[02:50:53] then bend in seris ear that's you know because it's issue is so close to so close to so many people
[02:51:00] in the community and but you're just strengthening bonds right you bring people together in the
[02:51:06] real world this is very counter culture and we're very cool with that you know and a world where
[02:51:10] kids are grown up text messaging each other to instead of talking instead of sitting in the
[02:51:15] captain's gap like like we are right now right and we need this where social animals and we need to
[02:51:22] be a part of something bigger than ourselves and so that's that's what we're about and physical health
[02:51:29] and mental health and raising awareness and it's it can't just be you know trying to beat it into
[02:51:36] people right like oh I'm a hammer I see a nail let me just tell let me tell you about veteran
[02:51:40] suicide prevention people just tune that out but when you've got a story as got a story like
[02:51:47] chas and you got some like Sarah that's that's able and willing to tell it I mean this is hard
[02:51:52] she's got to she's got to saddle up every time every time for this and she's doing it because she
[02:51:57] wants to change the number and she wants other people to not go through what she's had to go through
[02:52:03] and there's there's a lot of bravery that goes into that and you know and so that's I'm I'm proud
[02:52:10] that we get to I mean I work for her in this go rock works for her and you know we don't do anything
[02:52:16] that that she's not on board with in terms of Chad's story or just the way that we're running the
[02:52:22] event around and you know we just have this is just a unique opportunity in the kind of veteran
[02:52:29] suicide prevention space that that nobody wants to be too close to but unfortunately you know some
[02:52:36] of us are and and so it's a real honor this is this is the thing I'm most proud of that have been
[02:52:42] a part of because it is it's it's it's it's changing lives helping people and bringing them together
[02:52:51] and raising awareness for something that is is really important to me because I know I know you've
[02:52:56] lost people in your circle I'm sure people in my circle there's you know you have to
[02:53:01] Sarah sit right there I mean this is this is her life and so it just this is this matters this
[02:53:08] matters hugely to us well I'm on board like what do people need to do when they're on board what
[02:53:15] are we doing what's what's our deal well we we want people to take to the workout and that
[02:53:23] might look different for a lot of people you can go to your local gyms jump on it do it in your
[02:53:28] garage find a buddy we're hosting larger scale what we call live events this year and we're doing
[02:53:34] those in some we'll call like flagship cities one of them's here in San Diego so we're hoping maybe
[02:53:40] you might come and show up right home no number six San Diego it'll be across fit humanity so
[02:53:47] not too far from here I passed it actually on the way we're doing it November 3rd well let me

[02:53:58] it's their stumpmaster we can I'll be speaking and doing some other things down there so
[02:54:02] places outstanding if you get a chance go to four piers florida and visit the UDTC old museum it's awesome

[02:54:23] jacks jacks is actually November 6th now oh is it we've moved a little bit earlier yes we're hosting so
[02:54:29] you know call it a big giant monster start start getting your your train on you got a thousand
[02:54:34] box steps with a forty five pound rock bro that's a get some evolution that's a get some evolution for
[02:54:43] sure you know he used to do that I don't know if you know this but he used to do it in the garage
[02:54:48] I've video of this him doing step ups and he would do it and you know the garage and just shorts
[02:54:53] and his backpack he cut all the tags out of his gear right ounces equal pound Sarah ounces equal
[02:54:59] pound so he knew he was carrying but he used a projector and he projected a concoge on the back
[02:55:04] of our garage door so when I talk about focus that's how focused he was and that's that's how
[02:55:12] focused I am with this so and then and then what what we're raising money is that what we're doing
[02:55:17] we are raising money okay so um this this came about through a partnership that go rock at
[02:55:22] had with the Navy seal foundation also you know one of your brothers Chris Irwin who was Sarah was
[02:55:27] his level one cross fit instructor in Virginia Beach way back when I mean you know everyone is so
[02:55:32] close to to everyone and he had he had called me and said hey you know because did you
[02:55:39] look teach you any of these ones out here on the west coast I taught some in Delmar
[02:55:44] yeah I think I probably went to two or three of those over the years in that time frame too yeah
[02:55:50] yeah yeah I'm really surprised yeah I was like I was the massive deadlift now
[02:55:55] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[02:55:58] no you would not remember me from my physical attributes at a cross fits ever not yeah so we're
[02:56:03] raising money so we're raising money and you know this this came about through that partnership and
[02:56:09] and you know Chris had called me up and he was like you know nobody knows how to deal with this
[02:56:14] man everyone wants to deal with it and nobody knows how to deal with it and you know so you get
[02:56:22] guys that are in positions that you're at the seal foundation and go rock whatever right it's like
[02:56:26] we we want to deal with this we still didn't know how to deal with it and it's like well I think I got
[02:56:31] I think this Chad workout is the way that we can deal with this he goes but I got to call Sarah
[02:56:37] because obviously you know you don't do anything without the family and the family's not on board
[02:56:41] especially the this spouse I mean spouse is the that that's the that's the that's the deal and you know
[02:56:47] she had to think about it you know said no and then thought about it we ended up chatting with me and
[02:56:52] Emily and and Chris and Sarah and a call amount you know it's Florida we have you know it's hot
[02:56:59] about side my kids are inside pure chaos we're chatting on zoom or whatever it was in the middle
[02:57:03] of the pandemic and she's finally like okay let's do this and I'm like I kind of said okay well you
[02:57:08] know if you change your mind she's like no I've made up my mind we're doing this right and so to
[02:57:13] to throw her another like cross if there's a lot of hard workouts in CrossFit right a lot of you can
[02:57:19] look at you know you can do them harder you can scale them to whatever the the hardest the hardest
[02:57:26] workout in the history of CrossFit that's ever been done was how she did Chad the first time
[02:57:33] she went into into their garage and she put on Chad's Rucksack by herself and did Chad
[02:57:38] so think about that when you're feeling sorry for yourself out there you know because it's a hard
[02:57:44] workout and it is right and and that's what it's supposed to be everyone's selling easy that that's
[02:57:50] you don't think about anything when when life's easy except the next easy thing you're going to get right
[02:57:55] you're you're meant to dig deep you're meant to think about this and and that's that's the goal and so
[02:58:01] raising money half of it's going to the seal foundation Sarah has a nonprofit called the step up project and
[02:58:09] and that's you know it's it's veteran mental health stuff it's all going to support that
[02:58:15] yeah well that's outstanding and you know I have to throw this out there because like earlier you
[02:58:22] we were talking in the middle of whatever some high emotion moments and you said something about the
[02:58:27] the the families right and I just I I thought about it but then you know we kept talking but
[02:58:34] just the fact that the military families out there and what they put up with and what they go through
[02:58:40] and usually I mean in my mind I have to worry more than the people that are than the military themselves
[02:58:47] so on on top of all this just you know the families that are out there that the the
[02:58:53] the spouses you know come on down too because like it just get to know other people that are
[02:59:03] living that life you know I know that might might my wife you know she wasn't around we didn't have
[02:59:09] any family around like we didn't have any family we lived in California we lived in Virginia Beach I was
[02:59:13] gone almost the entire time she didn't know anyone she ended up doing what you did which is going to
[02:59:18] live with my parents for a while but yeah just families right military families too come and get it
[02:59:24] that's what I'm thinking family friendly kid friendly we don't discriminate come on down all of them
[02:59:30] it was it was so awesome in Virginia Beach it was such a great vibe you know we were there at the
[02:59:35] crack a dawn right set and box is up and then you know it's like all of a sudden people start
[02:59:41] to show up in waves because you need a box right so there's waves of people getting on the box
[02:59:46] and people I mean we were there my flight was late that that afternoon and you guys are still you know
[02:59:52] there was still a big crew there just like social it was social and so it's not a depressing
[02:59:58] you know it's not it's not like you just people can't live inside that space forever right
[03:00:03] you have you you have your your difficult moments and you think about it and it's in it's hard
[03:00:08] but you know anybody anybody that that served the way that Chad served like the guys I served with
[03:00:15] you don't want people to walk around depressed after you're gone you want them you you don't want that
[03:00:22] I also think like a lot of I just think the more we do talk about it the the easier it is for someone
[03:00:29] else to say me too and so it's hard to come out and talk about this all the time and I've had
[03:00:38] this week has been a very busy week for me so I'm pretty it's been hard but I have to believe that
[03:00:45] the more I talk about it and share Chad's story or share the story of of other friends that have
[03:00:52] passed took their lives that other people will start to speak up at this virginian beach event I had
[03:00:58] three people separately pull me aside and confide in me struggles that they had I've had people
[03:01:05] reach out to me through social media like long messages I don't care I don't care how long it is I don't
[03:01:10] care how short it is and I respond back and I I think that it's slow and I think it's a trickle
[03:01:18] but the potential for this workout done around veterans day so we can talk about people's stories
[03:01:26] so that it might encourage someone else to say me too maybe all if all they need to hear is that
[03:01:32] they're not alone and that someone else feels that too maybe that's what someone needs and that's great
[03:01:37] yeah that's uh when you know what's happening it makes me so much easier and I talk about this
[03:01:47] like you get a new guy like Jason you get a new guy that looks really nervous before their first
[03:01:51] operation and if you go hey bro here's what's going on your nervous it's cool you're a little
[03:01:56] crazy your stomach's a little messed up yeah because they're they're scared they're nervous and if
[03:02:00] you go yeah that's normal it's just no big deal you're gonna feel that that way a little bit before
[03:02:04] you go on an ops uh no big deal don't worry about it that's your body preparing to go into combat it's
[03:02:08] all good and you can see like relief on their face that's mentorship right there yeah yeah we need more
[03:02:13] of that yeah and this to me this this whole thing is like if you can tell someone oh yeah you you've
[03:02:21] breached 47 doors in your last three week trip which is not an extraordinary and I'm like that
[03:02:27] that's you know oh you you've got crashed in the room however many times you shot a coral goost off
[03:02:34] 29 times you or you were the rate the RSO so you had you know two troops go through and shoot
[03:02:41] one per man and you rate you RSO all the fun that's whatever you know 80 freaking blast next to your
[03:02:49] head that you sat through and there's some things that are going on inside your brain here's what's
[03:02:54] going on here's what you need to watch out for here's how you can get ahead of it that kind of
[03:03:00] conversation about this stuff is the same thing that it impacts that young new guy that goes okay
[03:03:06] got it now I can grab it now I can get a hold of it and I can move forward it's awesome
[03:03:15] Chad 1000x dot com that's where we can go to find out about this stuff go rock your at go rock
[03:03:23] cross the board cross the board Jason if you want to talk to Jason at go rock and just go rock
[03:03:28] if I live in Idaho can I do go go rock yes what if I live in Nebraska so look here's the thing
[03:03:37] we have we have 500 official go rock clubs around the the country and and part of it is
[03:03:44] we we're activating all of them for this we really believe in this world of people getting together
[03:03:50] in the real world and this is not about you don't have to be of a veteran to do this you don't
[03:03:55] have to be anything except willing to show up right and you get so much out of that and got through
[03:04:00] a freaking thousand stuff up it just that fly out yeah it's an hour you know it's an hour yeah
[03:04:06] okay slow and steady slow and steady wins the race yeah I mean yeah and you want to train up
[03:04:13] yeah well that's maybe we need to release some kind of a preparatory workout so I want to
[03:04:18] wrap though people coming up you're worried about people coming at you after for for a
[03:04:25] wrappedo now come on I've imposed a wrappedo on a few people and it it doesn't feel good I feel
[03:04:31] comfortable you know I always feel like I don't do it anymore I kind of figured it out like it's just
[03:04:38] it's not I don't like doing that to people no no we it's same thing so this claimer is you need to
[03:04:44] train yourself up this is an hour it's it's step ups yeah you got it up up so the 45 found
[03:04:49] played on your back yeah scale it down if you're not right do we need to train what we need to
[03:04:53] train for yes that's what I'm saying so it's a buy-in for your your workout it's it's a cash out
[03:04:59] for your workouts whatever else you're doing just just integrate a box if you've got a cooler
[03:05:03] in your house use a cooler if there's you know like whatever the case may be you have steps
[03:05:08] yep get it uh Instagram you're on Instagram yes Sarah Wilkinson 7 number 7 yep
[03:05:20] Jason you got anything else did I miss anything I don't think so and do we miss anything
[03:05:28] oh well I guess just to bring just to make the point one more time and is that where we find the
[03:05:34] guys are very fragile I'm gonna say fragile is in their transition time so when people are
[03:05:42] separating from the military maybe they didn't hit retirement maybe they've done 10 years in
[03:05:47] their transitioning out or their at retirement and now they need to transition to civilian life that
[03:05:54] is a very for a seal I'm gonna say that's a very delicate time for them and I would encourage
[03:06:04] families peers to really be on the lookout for them during that time because as we've talked so
[03:06:12] much about the brain and PTSD there's also that loss of of tribe or at least they feel as though
[03:06:20] there is and what we see is sometimes that increases the likelihood of maybe someone not making a
[03:06:28] really good decision so I would just encourage people to just be of the best support for those people
[03:06:36] during that period of transition yeah interestingly that's when a that's when a seal platoon is
[03:06:43] most exposed when they're transitioning from the water to the land or the land to the water and there's
[03:06:50] not only a perceived loss of tribe like you're talking about but also that perceived loss of
[03:06:55] mission because what have I been doing my whole life and all of a sudden what am I gonna do now?
[03:07:01] Yeah when Chad when Chad was close to 20 years we were at the discussion of what we do you know my
[03:07:06] dad served 26 years his dad served somewhere about that I can't quite remember and you know the hard part
[03:07:15] is I I really kind of hope he would pick us I thought okay we've done 20 years like we've done 20
[03:07:22] years me Sarah Chad Kinsey Hudson we've done it boom pick us and he didn't and I again believe he
[03:07:33] had a warrior's heart and he was born to do this but I said to him well you know we talked about
[03:07:44] jobs and I just remember he looked at me and he said I don't have any skills that's what they think
[03:07:51] I mean he was dead serious and you're thinking what I mean I know that you're not gonna go work
[03:07:56] for someone and be hanging out in bushes and kicking down doors most likely but what the skills these
[03:08:03] guys do have I mean most of them are are very intelligent critical thinkers analytical
[03:08:11] problem solvers think outside of the box can make decisions quickly
[03:08:16] that is a lot of really great attributes that many organizations and civilian world would want and so
[03:08:25] again just to speak to I you know it's that loss of identity and it's like I've been shooting guns
[03:08:31] and busting down doors what what else do I do?
[03:08:38] one of my first put to chief said he there was a old Vietnam seal and he was a male man now
[03:08:45] and they would go over there and like drink beer or whatever it is house and he'd tell stories
[03:08:50] about nom nice and he had this picture on the wall and it was like a shop from behind like a picture
[03:08:59] of of a guy's back and the guy's the guy whose back you see is clearly a Vietnam seal with a floppy
[03:09:06] hat and a stoner and his web gear on and his jungle cammy top and his blue jeans and he
[03:09:11] standing in front of like a corporate desk and the corporate desk there's the boss guys looking
[03:09:17] at him in the caption underneath this I'm sorry sir we don't have any jobs for appointment here
[03:09:24] which is true but to your point and believe me I see this all the time I work with companies
[03:09:28] all over the country and all over the world actually and they absolutely need the individuals
[03:09:34] that have these kind of attributes that you're talking about and there is absolutely a new mission
[03:09:39] when you get done with the military to go out in the civilian world and have an impact make people's
[03:09:44] lives better and build great products and build great companies and and do great things and that is
[03:09:49] absolutely available and you are needed in the in the civilian world and that's the way it is
[03:09:58] we need them too all right like our country needs people with this kind of experience spread
[03:10:05] throughout our our country spread throughout our companies spread throughout our communities spread
[03:10:09] throughout our our neighborhoods and one of the things that makes San Diego such a great town is
[03:10:14] it's it's a military there's it's a military town you've got this just underpinnings of San Diego
[03:10:19] the foundation is strong it's the same where I live in Jacksonville beach I mean my my neighbor
[03:10:24] two doors down is a top gun instructor I mean these things are just normal around
[03:10:29] us and it's great they're just good people that are just you know this talk about you know the
[03:10:35] greatest generation coming back to America and just doing great stuff getting educated and working
[03:10:40] their asses off and building America into America and you know we need more of that and so we need
[03:10:47] we need the transition is it's to echo her point I mean it's just sucks I mean don't underestimate
[03:10:53] it under any circumstances it can happen to you it will happen to you it will be terrible and and
[03:10:59] just now that you know it's common brace for it a little bit take it easy on yourself build out
[03:11:04] some support structures around you you know stuff like that and we just this is going to
[03:11:10] require something that is not kind of normal this day and age it's going to require us to kind of
[03:11:17] work together you know like how to support transitioning folks better how to kind of build stronger
[03:11:25] communities in the real world how to like that's what we need we don't you don't need guys coming
[03:11:30] out and it's like hey you don't you need to do you need to be an influencer on Instagram right
[03:11:35] like no you know how about not that right and and so you know it's it's it's difficult it's difficult
[03:11:44] and and we have to keep having the conversation that that's why I respect you and then and I
[03:11:50] respect this long form podcast stuff that you do because it's it forces people you know it's not
[03:11:57] just soundbites it's like hey here's the story this is nothing's as simple as it looks on someone's
[03:12:03] feed and you know that that's kind of what real life is like and and I think that we we need more of
[03:12:09] that not less totally agree well speaking along form I've kept you in here for over three hours
[03:12:20] Jason thank you for what you're doing thanks for your service you know we covered that last time
[03:12:26] and thanks for what you're continuing to do build and go rock and forming communities out there
[03:12:31] real communities I can see this look in your eye when you when you start saying that and and I get it
[03:12:35] man and for me it's a lot through jiu jitsu but look that that's a real thing and getting people together
[03:12:42] to get together and sweat and work to positive thing man appreciate what you're doing and Sarah
[03:12:50] obviously thanks for coming on thanks for your service thanks for your sacrifice thanks for holding the
[03:12:57] line and while your husband was gone and gone again and gone again and and being there and
[03:13:05] raising the family and building a business and doing all those things the all the military families
[03:13:11] that are listening right now for what you go through and and what they risk so thanks to you
[03:13:21] thanks to your kids as well for what they've gone through and of course Chad um thanks for your service bro
[03:13:36] we won't forget amen thank you and with that Sarah Wilkinson and Jason McCarthy have
[03:13:47] left the building and echo Charles we need to go a little bit old school I think on this one for
[03:14:01] the decompression right so if you've never listened this before the original purpose of
[03:14:11] when we would get done with the podcast echo Charles and I would just kind of start talking about
[03:14:16] stuff for a little while it was to decompress from a heavy subject as we started doing podcast
[03:14:24] I started hitting some heavy subjects along the way this we would originally just kind of start talking
[03:14:29] and I would just kind of let echo talk for a little bit while I did the decompression because I'm
[03:14:35] usually the one that's all wrapped up in whatever subject is we're talking about so certainly
[03:14:42] a in need of a little decompression after that one just a just a very tough subject and and
[03:14:52] that's why we're talking about it right we're talking about it as you know Sarah said something
[03:14:59] that she doesn't want anyone else to have to go through and that's why we talk about these things
[03:15:04] so for a little decompression I'll let you talk a little bit echo Charles we we want people to
[03:15:17] take care of themselves it's true so you you like it's weird because so that there's so many
[03:15:22] mysteries to the brain so and with your body like your physical your other parts of your body
[03:15:29] it's like less of a mystery right so like yeah you go in you know you're in a combat scenario you get
[03:15:35] shot in the abdomen then it's like okay it's gonna be pretty straightforward as far as hey can we save
[03:15:41] this guy can we not you know all the stuff and like he can bleed out he there's all these things and
[03:15:45] then there's these you know you can take specific actions and then hopefully we can save them all this
[03:15:51] you get shot on the leg or something while you're running or you blow out your knee or something
[03:15:55] it's like okay it's broken he can't run anymore it's like pretty straightforward but the brain
[03:15:59] gets damaged and one way or another it's kind of like there's no telling what's gonna happen
[03:16:03] a lot of the time you know and you don't know when either it's it is the brain is the mysterious
[03:16:10] part of the anatomy right now and nerves right and I don't really know how they work it's
[03:16:15] very hard to like repair them and and then yeah as we said you take that brain and rattle around
[03:16:21] inside of a inside of your skull over and over again we don't know what it's gonna do but we know
[03:16:28] it's not good we know that yeah and then you have to make it kind of in a way we're okay remember
[03:16:34] cursed the NS yes right so she she got jammed out she got injured and she still had her leg you know
[03:16:40] she's she's doing this thing and then but she's constantly being checked in upon you know checked on
[03:16:44] and be like okay and then over time they were like hey okay we're at a point where we got to
[03:16:49] make this very specific decision and we know what could and you know all the stuff and it was
[03:16:53] pretty it was pretty clear and then you make the decision but that's an example of
[03:16:57] incurring an injury and then it's still having lasting effects last and effects last and until you
[03:17:02] got it you know either risk actually dying or risk a huge or bigger injuries or just say
[03:17:10] top it off or amputated and you know remember her talking about she knows she because she could still
[03:17:16] walk yeah yeah and she was taking her last walk on the beach in the sand yeah exactly right
[03:17:25] but a perfect example of like you can incur the injury it's still handle still you know go about
[03:17:31] your business sure you jumped up here and they're here and they're there and then but the injury
[03:17:35] is still progressing yeah it's getting you know getting worse yeah and then you got and mean
[03:17:40] well but the thing is again for your your other parts of your body it's kind of like there's kind
[03:17:43] of a protocol you can check in and be like okay for the brain so mysterious it's like we
[03:17:48] can try and we are kind of trying to do that but it's so mysterious that it's not as cut in dry
[03:17:53] like that and it's the same exact thing he incurred all these injuries at some point and that
[03:17:59] thing just keeps lasting and lasting getting worse and worse and worse you know until it gets you
[03:18:06] it's hard to like get a grip on exactly what's happening
[03:18:10] you just crazy though it's the unknown frontier of the human body probably the most unknown
[03:18:16] frontier of the human body yeah the nerves and the brain and there's so many illusions too even
[03:18:22] like with yourself where you can be like I just do this in this situation or that situation or I
[03:18:28] would never choose to do that but you get in a certain like situation you do some stuff that's
[03:18:32] real unexplainable or only explainable later even though you thought from before hand you see
[03:18:38] you were you were so convinced of something and then afterwards you're like oh she also
[03:18:43] surprised on what you did you know kind of thing so it's like so there's this big illusion like
[03:18:47] it's like oh yeah you could just make the decision not to or whatever but it's like back to
[03:18:52] the work like that lots of factors come into play well we do want people to like I said
[03:19:01] want people to take care of themselves yeah and the ones around them and around them but we got
[03:19:06] a kind of like the analogy goes with the the plane and the oxygen got to put the oxygen on your
[03:19:12] own face before you put it on your kids it's true so so you got to do a little something to
[03:19:16] kind of keep yourself in the game Sarah mentioned something where he said oh I don't have any
[03:19:21] skills right and he's talking about getting a job or something like this and I was thinking yeah
[03:19:24] you know I can see why someone might think that off like for at first but the fact is you have
[03:19:30] a lot of skills because one of the main skills is straight up capability in all these different ways
[03:19:36] where you know you can learn this specific thing or learn that specific trade and all this other
[03:19:41] stuff but if someone who's just a more capable person across the board that guy's going to excel in
[03:19:45] those skills for sure so in my opinion that's an important thing to be capable and to stay capable
[03:19:52] sure that's on this path of capability hopefully it takes a minute some heavies it happens that's
[03:20:01] kind of like you mentioned you just do and you just if you're going hard are you not going to get
[03:20:06] ding the no you are going to get that's kind of the nature of going hard same saying no just like
[03:20:13] and work out just like with anything else but don't worry supplementation will help us all
[03:20:18] through those dings dance so anyway chocolate supplements a lot more you've seen chocolate supplements
[03:20:25] so first thing we're going to be compressing you know you made me chuckle a little bit we're trying
[03:20:30] over here decompression okay yeah so chocolate has a new era of energy drinks straight up healthy for
[03:20:36] you I know we don't need quite health and energy drinks in the same thing didn't you still no we do
[03:20:41] know we do now new era discipline go any different flavors best flavors mango kind of by far
[03:20:49] to pass and that's like an activity and that's saying a lot because the orange is freaking good
[03:20:56] you know on the sour out like these are like good flavor they taste good but like mango is just
[03:21:01] so much better it's like crazy it's saying a lot you're saying yeah the good thing is that these
[03:21:07] drinks they taste different you you got a some people might not like mango probably a small number
[03:21:13] people some people might not like orange some people might not like sour apple sniper some people
[03:21:19] might not like jockel Palmer some people might not like whatever so the recommendation is try
[03:21:27] on try one see what you like yeah let me know but let echo Charles know if his signature flavor is
[03:21:36] the best well it senses factually the best you love your flavor the best well you ever drink another
[03:21:41] different kind yes yeah okay see that's what's weird only because I don't want to come on I
[03:21:47] don't have any I got a cup of tea and right in them and you know there's that but if you had
[03:21:51] all flavors in a fridge every for one year yeah I can do one year yeah and I was restocking years
[03:21:59] whatever after replace a sour apple sniper you would never have to know here's a thing I could do
[03:22:05] one year but in the spirit of you know nature and all that stuff like if you're eating steak
[03:22:11] every single night and someone offered you to throw off the path of the of the mango man in
[03:22:16] the spirit of variety yes okay for sure well that's you know that's the I think that's natural
[03:22:21] I'm pretty sure I would only drink jockel Palmer because it takes so good to me yeah but I also only
[03:22:29] stakes so there you go see because you're different all right so we got a drink is what you're saying
[03:22:35] it doesn't matter what flavor you choose to drink at any particular time regardless if mango is the best
[03:22:41] flavor it's all healthy for you so you drink in the energy drink you get in the front end the
[03:22:47] energy a little boost that we sometimes want boom but you get the health benefits as well as
[03:22:54] opposed to the poison benefits or lack of benefits or whatever that's your next year on a
[03:22:59] summer adventure either way discipline go you can get this at wall wall vitamin shop
[03:23:05] yep Amazon yeah and origin USA.com also we have jockelfield.com jockelfield.com
[03:23:13] yeah but jockelfields the easier you remember yeah yeah that's the direct one of you
[03:23:17] you don't got to click around all that stuff also that joint where for this for your joints
[03:23:22] when you're lifting hard doing jiu-jitsu like you don't want to worry about the joints if you
[03:23:25] don't want to worry about your joints this is the one that we need I don't want to worry about
[03:23:29] that joints yeah it's gonna be pretty rare you can want to worry about your joints but I don't know
[03:23:33] some people are more in touch with that kind stuff and that's cool too either way
[03:23:36] join our her and super krill oil will make sure that they're still in the game longevity man
[03:23:42] hey if you had the greens yet no well we have greens now all right and decide to come up with a creative
[03:23:49] name jockel greens we made some very good greens and so you can check those out to live you if
[03:23:59] you don't eat enough vegetables like me or fruits like me yeah now you can put in a scoop yeah that's
[03:24:08] good and and again you know true jockel style apparently you're making these things taste good
[03:24:14] yeah which is very not hard core of you by the way but it is very efficient and when it's a little
[03:24:19] it's real low drag it's also results related right we're not trying to feed not trying to get you
[03:24:24] to drink something that tastes like junk yeah and then you don't drink it because it tastes like junk yeah
[03:24:30] why would we do that you're not trying to offer up another element of resistance in a good
[03:24:35] path that we're all on yeah yeah it's true that's a good move also vitamin D3 cold war immunity
[03:24:40] stuff this is essential so don't forget about that kind stuff also mok he's talked about stakes
[03:24:46] I get it but sometimes you want to extra this back on the strawberry path right now you are going
[03:24:52] hardcore strawberry for like a week and a half I was going hardcore peanut butter for at least a
[03:24:57] month what's the what's your normal probably putting anything in there in the little banana
[03:25:01] little whatever what are you just straight mok mok and some variety of milk could be cooking up milk
[03:25:09] could be almond milk could be the milk could be the milk could be the milk milk milk milk milk milk
[03:25:15] milk but yeah mix it up with one of those and they all taste legit they all have their own little
[03:25:20] sshsh you know yeah you don't know my protocol watch up in freaking on and it's freaking solid and
[03:25:25] it tastes good I don't know though so is it normal like what do you let's say you had a salad like not
[03:25:30] like a side salad but up a rope us salad you know you stick salad chicken salad whatever
[03:25:37] what do you drink with that what's the norm what pairs with that that don't say I know you can say
[03:25:42] water I know okay what's the jam you don't want to say water all right well water kind of
[03:25:47] goes with everything you always get what at the restaurant thinking to give you the water first
[03:25:50] that's the given but what is you know what's the jam your story your thing is not going anywhere
[03:25:55] swear where you go with this okay you're a lot of my what I pair with a big salad it's called
[03:26:00] the big salad chicken very robust salad um mok shake but just a plain one though plain like
[03:26:10] not usually I had a banana or frozen banana there or whatever not I don't know whatever
[03:26:14] so I'll go the peanut butter peanut butter chocolate and then milk or the almond milk or whatever
[03:26:19] just you know you don't add the oatmeal or bananas or whatever if you want to make it all luxury or whatever
[03:26:25] you can see but it like pairs nicely right off all right well either way these things again
[03:26:31] jockelfuel dot com subscribe if you want to influx you know where you don't got to remember
[03:26:38] to reorder or run out and all that stuff you don't have to remember you don't have to pay shipping
[03:26:43] oh yeah those are two real solid elements true so we mentioned origin us a dot com
[03:26:52] this is where you can get your American made denim yeah kind of a big deal no it's a real big deal
[03:26:57] yeah when you kind of go down the line it's like sure you get in good jeans I can't it that's this
[03:27:01] good it's great actually but I hear something crazy when we first looked into making these jeans
[03:27:07] hmm we were talking to people we were talking to people in the fashion industry legit
[03:27:15] I know yes I understand you don't much they wanted us to charge for a pair of jeans American
[03:27:19] made jeans you don't look the value placed on American 100% American made jeans were taken guess
[03:27:24] I'm much 118 I'm not kidding you they said the good market price
[03:27:31] $450 for a pair of jeans this was like a New York city with fashion paper and I like
[03:27:42] kicked Pete under the table like but I started $450 for a pair of jeans no that's not happening
[03:27:49] and we walked out I'm like that's not a big six not happy I was like he's a calm down you know
[03:27:53] I was kind of losing it because you know I already don't like fashion people in the first place now they want
[03:27:58] to be a person charge 400 because they're trying to they're trying to keep the control the market
[03:28:03] right trying to keep that thing elevated because they want to charge 450 for their pair of jeans
[03:28:08] yeah but you know the whole idea of charging that much for jeans like whatever they're doing
[03:28:14] there like it's not a matter of like hey we got a you know and it makes this logistical
[03:28:19] sense not that they're doing something oh no they're inflating the prices yeah for a reason like
[03:28:24] they're doing what's their thing what are they doing like that thing I think I'll tell you what they're
[03:28:27] doing they know that people want to buy American made stuff they know they can't make it they want
[03:28:33] us to price it out of the markets then after worry yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[03:28:36] yeah that's what we've been doing that makes sense what I'm playing there games well the good news
[03:28:41] is it doesn't cost 450 999 whatever you should so boom there you go you also got boots on there
[03:28:48] yeah by the way saying American made 100% bringing back the industry by the way expanding like
[03:28:54] cheese Luis for us cheese Luis goes but I'm saying there's a bit of there's a lot going on
[03:29:01] there's a lot going on there's a bit of conflict that's a bit of a lot of things yeah but yes so
[03:29:07] ordinary USA there's a lot of cool stuff and you did so stuff on there as well yeah you get that
[03:29:11] key yeah you get the key if you're getting back into you just to where you get your staying in
[03:29:15] digits you want another key okay I want to come you did it not you talked about with Jason
[03:29:20] Go Rock awesome good community do you do you also community you sure also we have a store
[03:29:26] it's called jocco store so boom if you're on the path you want to represent discipline equals freedom
[03:29:32] good take the high ground or the high ground will take you
[03:29:37] swirking your shirts and hoodies and hats and whatnot some shorts on there utility surfing swimming
[03:29:44] cruising left in jiu jie I said it all of it everything they're a little at hybrid or whatever
[03:29:51] anyway got some shorts on there too you know we talk of shorts with cargo pockets no
[03:29:55] well you can't be wearing them for swimming or jiu jitsu if they have the pocket on them the big
[03:30:01] pockets for the cargo cargo pockets no you can have a little cargo pocket on there not a freaking baggy
[03:30:08] like from the gap store cargo pocket from 1994 it does not have that no but the hate like the
[03:30:16] the pocket that you stick your hands into on the front you can't do jiu jitsu with those and swimming's
[03:30:20] not recommended oh yes you can trust me can well you might be able to it's not off
[03:30:28] yeah well maybe I'll put like zip can you put zippers on them that would be making a little bit better
[03:30:32] we need to do a pair of shorts with a slim pocket on the leg no wait and I think these are
[03:30:41] yeah I don't have to double check but they have like the pocket is kind of it breeds like through
[03:30:46] so the water can pass through I'm wearing them right now they do have that but that still see
[03:30:52] but you know what I'm doing right now working I'm paed get their good their excellent for podcast
[03:30:56] yeah right there excellent for cruising for sure swimming is marginal because that even though the
[03:31:02] water is made to drain out of them it's still your there's big pockets hold water we're not
[03:31:07] setting we're not swimming in the English channel yeah actually no no that's a thing so yeah so there's
[03:31:12] that and then jiu jitsu you know your toes get in the pond there or whatever so let's redesign
[03:31:18] yeah sir I always didn't redesign well are we lagging we're working on that one okay no it's
[03:31:25] it's a working progress or whatever but the good thing about this is swimming jiu jitsu I know
[03:31:31] you toes get stuck in there and it's true but it's they're not ideal because really what's ideal
[03:31:37] for jiu jitsu really it's like spats on our ashguard same thing we're swimming what's ideal for
[03:31:41] swimming go limpics check it out that's what's ideal for swimming okay a lot of us sometimes we don't
[03:31:45] on a way that can't stuff when we go swimming yeah some of us I don't understand if we're not
[03:31:49] swimming though English channel I get it we can jump in the in the in the surf zone if you if we're
[03:31:55] just cruising right now and then we just find yourself at the beach I don't know or like
[03:32:00] frickless go body surfing you can wear those shorts as I'm saying yes and they're gonna work great
[03:32:06] they're gonna be acceptable very it's not optimal they'll be appropriate oh but that now they're
[03:32:13] really good for normal life yeah which is what I wear them for but if I'm gonna roll I'm gonna put
[03:32:19] on a different pair of shorts that we need to make jocco store dot com let's see where you get all

[03:34:27] a mile order some cool stuff to hang on your wall got a bunch of books I just finished the
[03:34:32] audio version of final spin which is the next book that I've come out think it's coming out chill
[03:34:39] November six there's something like that which I just realized means I will not be
[03:34:44] in this area for the chat one thousand X event because I will be on the road okay I just recorded
[03:34:57] I just recorded the audio book and it was the first time that I got to see someone's reaction live
[03:35:05] to the book because there was a there was a worker there was a audio engineer yeah
[03:35:10] she was named Deb she was in their work in the work in the
[03:35:15] this is what this is what this is what's fired up there's funny parts in that book
[03:35:25] right and she she's outside the glass right I'm in the I'm in the room right she's outside the glass
[03:35:31] and I'm watching her and like I would read a funny line and I can see her she's like laughing
[03:35:35] she laughing like laughing like laughing at me like nodding her head and then there's a
[03:35:39] couple point parts in the book that are kind of like fired up like they're gonna go and she was
[03:35:43] literally raising your hands like I look at her like raising her and like they're gonna go
[03:35:49] and then that was day one lots of setup you know you can kind of get into the characters a little bit
[03:35:55] day two stuff starts getting a little bit going sideways day two Deb openly weeping that I can
[03:36:03] visually watch her crying that's like reading like the some parts of the story that are heavy
[03:36:11] so final spin if you don't know what that's all about check it out dang that's crazy
[03:36:16] it's like like she was like your little audience she had an audience of one yeah yeah yeah
[03:36:20] and you know what check this out she's supposed to be a professional they know really
[03:36:23] like no that's perspective Deb she is a professional she did a great job and I was much
[03:36:28] appreciated she's not supposed to be in there laughing she ring and crying right that's not right yeah
[03:36:35] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[03:36:37] would you be stoked if your doctors doing a surgery on you like high five and then laughing like
[03:36:42] not right right you're gonna be stoked on that but I was definitely stoked yeah it was
[03:36:50] think about it's like a you're right it was an audience or one and she's not supposed to be
[03:36:56] showing emotions and she's in there getting emotional all emotions revealed so if you want to
[03:37:02] feel some of those emotions here about it also did a little the additional the additional commentary
[03:37:10] for the audio track is with good deal Dave Burke because he read it and he interviewed me and
[03:37:16] they talked about it so that's that we uh final spin check it out pre order it now if you want
[03:37:22] that first edition who knows with that kind of emotional reaction you could that first edition maybe
[03:37:27] hold on to some special move hold on to some special something like pat song to your kids when
[03:37:32] they're old enough yeah I talked to Dave Burke about that and like hey would you let your how old you
[03:37:38] can how old when your kids have to be before they're allowed to read this book and he's like I
[03:37:44] say I want him to read it as young as I can but all the there's swear words in it yeah there's
