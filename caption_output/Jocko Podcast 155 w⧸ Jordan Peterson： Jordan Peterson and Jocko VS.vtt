00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.50
This is Jocopot Gas No. 155 with me, Jocco-Willink.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
On the island, the dead were piling up.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In the mission report, the head of the convoy wrote,

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
at 2 p.m. on May 20th, I went to the island of Nizino with Commander Tepskov.

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
There was a terrible scramble, people crowding and fighting around the bags of flower.

6
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Dead bodies everywhere, a hundred or more, and lots of people crawling about and crying,

7
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
give us bread, boss, it's been two days since we've been given anything to eat.

8
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
They're trying to make us die of hunger and the cold.

9
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
They told us that people had begun eating the dead bodies,

10
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that they were cooking human flesh.

11
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The scene on the island was dreadful, appalling.

12
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.000
On May 21st alone, the three health officers counted 70 additional dead bodies.

13
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
In five cases, they emphasized the liver, the heart, the lungs,

14
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and fleshy part of bodies had been cut off.

15
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:46.000
On one of the bodies, the head had been torn off along with the male genital organs and part of the skin.

16
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
These mutilations constitute strong evidence of cannibalistic acts.

17
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
In addition, they suggest the existence of serious psychopathologies.

18
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000
On the same day, May 21st, the deportees themselves brought us three individuals who had been caught

19
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
with blood on their hands and holding human livers.

20
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Our examination of these three individuals did not reveal any extreme amaciation.

21
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And there's an elderly local peasant woman who reported the things we saw.

22
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
People were dying everywhere. They were killing each other.

23
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
There was a guard named Kostia Venikov, a young fellow.

24
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
He was courting a pretty girl who had been sent there. He protected her.

25
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
One day, he had to be away for a while.

26
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And he told one of his comrades, take care of her.

27
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
But with all the people, the comrades couldn't do much.

28
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:15.000
People caught the girl, tied her to a tree, caught off her breasts, her muscles, everything they could eat.

29
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.000
They were hungry. They had to eat. When Kostia came back, she was still alive.

30
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
He tried to save her, but she had lost too much blood.

31
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
She died. That was the kind of thing that happened.

32
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
When you went along the island, you saw flesh wrapped in rags.

33
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Human flesh that had been cut and hung in the trees.

34
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And that right there is from a book called Cannibal Island by Nicholas W.

35
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Who's written books about communism.

36
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I think is most famous is the black book of communism.

37
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Cannibal Island specifically breaks down one of the small individual nightmares of the Soviet Gulags.

38
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
But the nightmare was not small.

39
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And it certainly was not specific. It was widespread and it was broad.

40
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And it was almost incomprehensible.

41
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And very little about it would be known or not for one man.

42
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Alexander, Solchonetsen, who not only survived the Gulags,

43
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.000
but lived on to write incredibly detailed and very well-researched books about the Gulags.

44
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Some of them were fictionalized like a day in the life of Ivan, Denisovic,

45
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and for the good of the cause.

46
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000
But most comprehensively in his three volume-tone, the Gulag, Arkepelegov.

47
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And this series is a massive series.

48
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And it's been cut down to an abridged version that was actually approved by the author himself.

49
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And the abridged version has just been re-released in Europe,

50
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
where they forwarded by a man that I think repopularized that book.

51
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
A man that is here today to discuss that book and among other things.

52
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I'm sure a man that I needed to give an introduction to the first time he was on this podcast.

53
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But now who needs no introduction whatsoever.

54
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
A man by the name of Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.

55
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Jordan, thank you for coming back on.

56
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
How is it rough beginning, Jockel?

57
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Jesus.

58
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Yeah.

59
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I remember when I started listening to you would say something along the lines of that,

60
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
you know, we are quite capable of creating hell for ourselves as human beings.

61
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And that clearly, that situation, I don't know.

62
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I mean, that's hell.

63
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Yeah.

64
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And close enough.

65
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Yeah.

66
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And it's created by us, which I think is obviously horrific.

67
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And the Gulag archipelago, you know, you talked about that book a lot.

68
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And one of the things that, on that book, it's you hard, obviously.

69
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
For me, there's a book called About Face by Colonel David Hackworth.

70
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I'm from a different world, I guess, that you in many ways.

71
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
The book that hit me hardest in my life was that book about face.

72
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And it's, it's one of those things that when I read it, I started putting it together

73
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
It's like things started to fit.

74
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And I remember that.

75
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And I was wondering, I guess from my perspective, at what point did you read the Gulag archipelago?

76
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And at what point did you start to say, okay, there's something really, really important here

77
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
for me to try and understand?

78
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Well, I read it back in the 1980s, early.

79
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I would say, I'd read some social nits and before that.

80
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I read the day in the life of Ivan Nissovich when I was about 13 or 14.

81
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And then I read the Gulag archipelago in my early 20s when I was reading a lot of psychological material too

82
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
when I started reading Yung and Freud and the Great clinicians.

83
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And I was reading a fair bit about what had happened and Nazi Germany at the same time

84
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and also Victor Frankl's man's search for meaning.

85
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And the Solgenytsons book is, in some ways, like an elaborated extension of Frankl.

86
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Frankl, of course, described what happened to him in the Nazi concentration camps.

87
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And so relatively short book and it's a great book.

88
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000
But the Solgenytsons book is, it's much broader and I would say, deeper.

89
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And the thing that affected me most particularly was the psychological take on the totalitarian states.

90
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
You know, I had been studying political science up to that point.

91
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And the political science, scientists and the economists, who I would say were under the sway of Marxist thinking,

92
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
although not nearly to the degree that they are now,

93
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:04.000
were convinced that the reason that people engaged in conflict was basically a consequence of argumentation over resources.

94
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
You know, it was basically an economic argument.

95
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And I never bought that.

96
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
It never made sense to me.

97
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Obviously there are circumstances where that's true, but it didn't seem to be fundamentally the case.

98
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Like tribal warfare isn't precisely about resources.

99
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000
It's maybe it's about territory or maybe it's about identity, but it never seemed to me to be simply about resources.

100
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Partly because, well, a resource is something that people value,

101
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
but it isn't obvious why people value what they value.

102
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And so it doesn't solve the fundamental problem.

103
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Anyways, when I was reading Frankl and Solgenytsons,

104
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I started to more deeply understand the relationship between the individual and the atrocity.

105
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And that's what I found most interesting was that Frankl's claim and Solgenytsons claim as well,

106
00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:02.000
that it was the moral corruption of the citizenry that allowed the totalitarian catastrophes to occur.

107
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And that in some sense was the responsibility of every individual in the system who looked the other way or who participated actively.

108
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I mean, even in the Gulag camps themselves, they were almost all run by the prisoners.

109
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
There wasn't enough administrative manpower to run the prison system without the cooperation.

110
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So to speak of the prisoners.

111
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:33.000
So it is a surreal sort of hell where you imprison yourself and Solgenytsons fundamental claim.

112
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And this was true for Frankl as well and also for Vaclav Havel,

113
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
who eventually became president of Czechoslovakia, or at least to the Czech Republic.

114
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I don't remember which.

115
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000
You know, they believed that it was the individual proclivity to accept lies that fostered the ability of Thai people.

116
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
The ability of tyrants to destroy the state.

117
00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And then, well, and that also led to complicitness with regards to all the absolute atrocities that we're occurring in both the Nazi state and the Soviet state.

118
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And I think that's true.

119
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.000
When I read, like I read Solgenytsons books and a lot of the books I read about Nazi Germany too, not as a victim,

120
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and not as a hero, but as a perpetrator.

121
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And I know which I think it's really important. It's something that's really important to do when you read history.

122
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Is that it's easy to cast yourself as a victim.

123
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
It's easy to cast yourself as the person who would have been heroic in the circumstance,

124
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000
but it's also unbelievably useful to understand that there's a good chance had you been in those situations

125
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
that you wouldn't have been on the side of the good guys.

126
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And that's a terrible, it's really a terrible realization,

127
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
it's necessary, realization.

128
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Again, just going back to this idea of what you get out of reading,

129
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
because people ask me to ask me to, because I read books all the time on my podcast,

130
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
and what you just said, it struck me as something that's...

131
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
People have told me, I read that book before,

132
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
but I didn't really get out of it, what you got out of it,

133
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
and when I heard you read it, I was saying,

134
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
how did I... I need to go reread this book.

135
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And I think one of the key things is you looked at these books as you were not the victim,

136
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
but the perpetrator, one thing that when I read books, I read a lot of books,

137
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
mostly about war.

138
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
For me, I always think about the people,

139
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
I don't always see myself as the person that goes in heroically,

140
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
storms the beaches and survives.

141
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.000
In a war book, there's these people that get mentioned for a half a paragraph for two sentences,

142
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and sometimes they don't even have a name,

143
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
because you're the battalion commander storm in the beach of Normandy.

144
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
You're not going to name every single person,

145
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
but for some reason, and maybe it's just my experiences of being in combat,

146
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
when I read about that two sentences of that guy,

147
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
that gets shot, that gets killed, that gets blown up,

148
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
that's what I think.

149
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I completely understand and relate to that person.

150
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
I don't just see it as me being the guy that is always winning,

151
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
and always doing okay, and always surviving.

152
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I feel and relate to those guys that didn't,

153
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and part of that is just because of my friends that I lost in combat.

154
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Like those guys, they're people,

155
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
and I think that key thing of reading it and going,

156
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
man, every single person, like when you read about these,

157
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
you're talking about millions of people that were tortured, died, murdered,

158
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
every one of those people, key word as people,

159
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
every one of those people is a person,

160
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000
and to your point, every single one of those executioners,

161
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
every single one of those murders, is also a person.

162
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
There's a great book called, ordinary man.

163
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Oh yeah, we reviewed that on this podcast.

164
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Right, and so it's one of the greatest books written about what happened

165
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
in the Second World War, I think, on the end of the atrocity end,

166
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
because the author does such a lovely job of,

167
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
well, it's a strange way of putting it in this context,

168
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
but it's about this police battalion that was moved into Poland

169
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
after the Germans went through and occupied the country,

170
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
to establish order like police do, but also to participate

171
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
in the mopping up, let's say, that was part and parcel of the war,

172
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
and these were ordinary policemen, middle class guys,

173
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
most of whom had been educated and socialized before the Nazi propaganda

174
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
machine really got rolling, so they weren't like Hitler, youth types.

175
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
They were ordinary men, and they were brought,

176
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and they had a commander who had made an explicit case

177
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
that if they weren't able to tolerate the conditions in Poland

178
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
that they could go home, so there was no top down order that you had to do this

179
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
or else, and then they were, you know, first of all,

180
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
they started rounding up, well, mostly Jewish people men between 18 and 65,

181
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
and then, you know, they started to participate in the entire atrocious mess,

182
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
and they were, they ended up many of them taking naked pregnant women out

183
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
into fields and shooting them in the back of the head,

184
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
and what the author does is outline how that happens to you,

185
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
you know, one step at a time, and so it's a really horrifying book,

186
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and it's a brilliant book, because there's no attempt to make

187
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
the perpetrators like some creatures that aren't human,

188
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
like just pure psychopaths, and of course, in a situation like Nazi Germany,

189
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
and in the horrors of the communist states,

190
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
there was no shortage of places for psychopaths to prevail,

191
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
but that's not really the issue. The issue is, well,

192
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
how does an ordinary person come to participate in a global horror,

193
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
let's say, and what does that mean about being an ordinary person?

194
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
And then the next question is, well, what does it mean about how you should

195
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
conduct your life, and one of the things that, I mean,

196
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
I think what happened to me when I read all this material in the 80s

197
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000
was that I became convinced that there wasn't anything more important to do

198
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
in the aftermath of what had happened in the 20th century,

199
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
than to try to build people who were responsible enough

200
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
as truth-telling courageous, responsible citizens,

201
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
so that the probability would increase that if they were in a position

202
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
to make a terrible choice that they would make the right one,

203
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
and I would say this lecture tour that I'm doing, which is now extended over

204
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
more than 100 cities, is an extension of the same thing.

205
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Well, I think it's the same thing that you're trying to do with your book.

206
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
We were just looking at your Mikey and the Dragon's book,

207
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
and you're trying to lay out a psychological pathway

208
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
that guides people towards responsibility and courage and truth,

209
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
and all of that, and that is the bulwark against tyranny,

210
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
actually at the individual level, and we kind of know that in the West.

211
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000
I think that's part of the core ethos of certainly of the English common law

212
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
system, certainly of the American way of looking at the world,

213
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
is that each citizen is the bulwark against tyranny,

214
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
and that's actually true.

215
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
And that's a terrible thing to think through,

216
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
because it means that you are responsible for the integrity

217
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
or lack thereof of your state, and it's on you.

218
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And there's something great about that, because it means that your existence

219
00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
actually matters to you and to your family and to the broader community

220
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
in a really major way, in a way that's much more significant

221
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
than you might think, and that your proclivity

222
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
to abdicate your moral responsibility echoes way farther than you might consider,

223
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
especially under some circumstances.

224
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
You know, in Solge Nitz and one of the things that's so amazing about the Gulagar

225
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Capalago is his story is not only of the absolute bloody catastrophe of the Soviet

226
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:35.000
state, and his incredibly astute documentation of the role that the utopian

227
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
political and philosophical assumptions of Marx's and played in creating the system,

228
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
right?

229
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
And then, in an aberration, it was a direct logical consequence of that

230
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
collectiveist viewpoint, and to document all that, but also to tell

231
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
English stories about people who were able at least to some degree

232
00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000
to not become corrupt and even under unbelievably horrific conditions.

233
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
And that's something you also get out of Victor Frankl's book,

234
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Man Search for Meaning, you know, and so the Gulagar Capalago

235
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
is a story about horror in some sense, but it's more a story of the triumph

236
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
of the fundamental triumph of the human spirit, and perhaps no more

237
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
perhaps most evident in the case of Solge Nitz and himself,

238
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
because he memorized this book in some sense while he was in the camps,

239
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
and then wrote it under extreme duress afterwards, and it's an immense undertaking,

240
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
and it's unbelievably emotionally intense, the entire book.

241
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
It's like one, you know, 1,700 page scream of outrage.

242
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
You just can hardly believe that someone can write at that white-hot

243
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:51.000
intensity for such a long period of time, and, you know, his book had an unbelievable

244
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
global impact, I think it's sold 30 million copies, and it definitely,

245
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
for at least a reasonable period of time, made it completely untenable for

246
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:08.000
utopian, resentful utopian intellectuals to ethically justify their radical

247
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000
leftist collectivism. It just blew the slats out from underneath any ethical

248
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
credibility that communism, that remained of the communist doctrine by the 1970s,

249
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
and that's a hell of a thing for someone to manage on their own.

250
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
It's a pretty big task.

251
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
So while you were going through that, I was thinking myself, so I was talking to

252
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000
I still talk to military folks, and I was talking to some military leaders

253
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
young leaders, so like platoon level and company level leaders, so these are

254
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
guys that are in charge of, you know, 40 guys or maybe 150 guys.

255
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
And, you know, you can have some real ethical problems, and one of the things that I

256
00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:02.000
said to this group was, I said, hey, in your, in your platoon, you've got a

257
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
murderer in your platoon. You've got someone in your platoon that is a

258
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.000
sadist. And they were kind of looking at me, um, suspect. You know, a

259
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
little bit like, come on now. Come on. What are you talking about?

260
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
How big is the platoon?

261
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Well, platoon is 40 guys. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And so I was actually going to ask you how

262
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
accurate I was, and then I was going to actually say that no matter what you say

263
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
how accurate is, even if it was even if it was one out of every thousand, you

264
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
have to act as a leader as if in your platoon, you've got one of those

265
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
guys or two of those guys. That's the way you need to act. Well, you look and

266
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
there's another book called the rape of Nandkeng. We've covered that.

267
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Yeah. Well, so one of the things that was really horrifying about that book

268
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
is so imagine that there's maybe let's say that there's one and a hundred just for

269
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
the sake of argument that's really got cruel and psychopathic traits.

270
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
What do you think professionally? What do you think that number is? Oh, I think

271
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
one percent isn't unreasonable. It could be higher than that. I mean,

272
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
there's gradations, right? You know, there's probably in a group of 40 people,

273
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
there's going to be one guy in there who's proclivity in that direction is

274
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
sufficiently strong so that you better keep an eye on him. That's for sure.

275
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
And this is a group of people that joined the millets. Right. So they're already,

276
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
you've already gotten, you've already got a group that's okay with, with

277
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
theoretically having to kill other people. Right. So this is probably,

278
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
you know, so if it's 100,000. Yeah. That's, that's likely an under estimate.

279
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
So I think your estimate is perfectly reasonable and it might be

280
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
conservative. What happened in Nandkeng was that the most

281
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
sadistic people became the targets of imitation and emulation.

282
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
And that's when things really get out of hand. Yeah. Right. So, and that's the same thing

283
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
for me, I'm a massacre. And that was, so when I was talking to this group,

284
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
and I'm getting, and I said to them, I said, you're looking at me like,

285
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
right now, like, I'm like, I don't know what I'm talking about. Like, I'm crazy.

286
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Who knows about the me, I'm a masker? And, and you know, all of a sudden,

287
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
it got quiet because if you know anything about the me, I'm a masker.

288
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
It was a normal group of guys. It was a normal group of guys.

289
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
It was a normal company of American soldiers. And you know what they'd been through

290
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
some stress. They'd been through, you know, they'd had their friends killed and

291
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
it was in Vietnam. There was no one really to react against or to take your

292
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
aggression out on because the enemy, you can see them. They would hide and it

293
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
was. But then they turned and they snapped. And the same thing.

294
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
You had the leader, a guy named Lieutenant Callie, who is the

295
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
little tune leader, who, I love for you to do a psychological profile.

296
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Maybe he's one of these guys. It was kind of like, it was totally

297
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
insecure about everything. And so he got those shoulder boards on, which is

298
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
the way the way a soldier needs to describe his experience as being a

299
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
tune leader. And what it did to him and he goes through that, this

300
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
book is fantastic to hear when he talks about what he did. He was looking

301
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
back saying, oh, I did this and I did this into this little rampage of

302
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
things that he, how he acted as a commander. I ate the food, the good

303
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
food right in front of my guys when they weren't good for, I was getting

304
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
the good food and he did a took advantage of all the little, all the

305
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
little comforts that you got being an officer.

306
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Yeah, well, he was trying in the whole book, and especially in that

307
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
section, which I think is in volume two, which I think is the greatest

308
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
of the three volumes, especially the last half of it, which is just

309
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000
absolutely, it's it's genius level writing, unbelievably

310
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
compelling and brilliant. And yeah, I mean, he, he said that when he

311
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
was in the camps that one of the things that he did, especially

312
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
once he started to identify people that he truly admired was to go over

313
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000
his life with a fine tooth comb and try to, try to remember everything

314
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
that he did wrong by his own estimation and then try to set it right

315
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
in some manner. And so there was a, that's a repentance and then a

316
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
redemption, right? There's a real, there's a real fundamental, like a

317
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
medieval Christian undertone to all of that. But it, what, one of

318
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
the things that's quite interesting is that when you talk about

319
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
issues that are this serious, you're almost inevitably in a

320
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
situation where you're going to find yourself compelled to use

321
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
some kind of quasi-religious language because you end up discussing

322
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
good and evil and issues of redemption and issues of repentance and

323
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
issues of conscience and seeing and all of that. There isn't

324
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
language that's deep enough to get out, otherwise. And what

325
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
socializing it's indeed was scour his conscience and try to put

326
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
himself together, partly because he was shamed, he was a

327
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
shamed of himself in the face of these extraordinarily extraordinary

328
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
people who seem to be able to keep their moral compass under circumstances

329
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
where no one should ever assume that they would keep their moral

330
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
compass because certainly, like I said, when I was reading this

331
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
the Gulag and other books like that, I never assumed that if I was in

332
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
those situations that I would have been one of the people who kept their head

333
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
and were able to withstand the temptation to become a trustee for

334
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000
example and to take things the easy way and to lured it over the other

335
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
prisoners and to adopt that position of authority. You know, it's like

336
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
it's like a head slave among slaves. But you know, you could say,

337
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
well, better to be the head slave than to be the bottom slave. And

338
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
well, that's true in some sense with regards to creature comfort,

339
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
but as socialists and point out points out, it might be a little bit

340
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
hard on your soul and that actually turns out to be something of

341
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
crucial, not only crucial importance psychologically, but crucial

342
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
importance sociologically and politically because if you

343
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
sacrifice that, then you warp the structure around you, which is exactly

344
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
what happened in the establishment of these camps. You know, and the

345
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Soviet Union was just one big lie. What was their old joke?

346
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
They pretend to pay us and we pretend to work. It's like the

347
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
whole, the whole book and the whole Soviet Union, when you read

348
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
about it now, it seems like it seems like a bad joke. It seems like

349
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
a bad movie. You couldn't just the way the way that

350
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Stalin would do something and the way that that order would come

351
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
out. It seems like one of those cheesy, you know, comedic movies

352
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
about these decisions that they're making. And it's surreal.

353
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
It's completely, it's completely insane. You know, at one point

354
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
he's talking about the, there was a new penalty for what they

355
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
called, clipping corn or, or, yeah, that basically a 12 year old kid

356
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
would be starving going to a field that we didn't. And

357
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
clip a cure a corn. And that happened in the Ukraine during the

358
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
decolocation, right? It was against the law to go out after the

359
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
fields were harvested. It was against the law to go out and

360
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
pick grain off the ground to feed your family. Right. And the prison

361
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
sentence was like a tenor, which is their little word for ten years.

362
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
So you're going to get, you steal a piece of corn or you pick up

363
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000
corn off the ground and you're getting ten years.

364
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Yeah. You can't comprehend that that is a very large

365
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
conversation that worked. Yeah. And they were, they, you know,

366
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
he did in the earlier parts of the book when he starts going through

367
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
the trials that they were doing on people. Yeah.

368
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000
And it's completely crazy. Yeah.

369
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Let's can't comprehend the cure.

370
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Yeah. Well, that's why I hate to see the kangaroo court

371
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
submerging all over, all over the West, you know, and, and, and

372
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
with the university sort of at the forefront of that.

373
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
So we're building these alternative court systems constantly that

374
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
don't follow standard legal procedure. And it's really,

375
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
we're messing with things that that we shouldn't be

376
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
messing with. And yeah, the whole, I mean, there are, there

377
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
are accounts. I believe it's in the Gulag of, of, of a

378
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
pause after a stellen speech, right? Where people would

379
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
stand up and applaud and they, and they'd applaud until until

380
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
literally the old people were falling over because if you were the

381
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
first person to stop applauding, then you were, well, it was

382
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
off to the camps with you. No, he absolutely outlines it.

383
00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
So that, that sounds so crazy to say. And he, he outlines a

384
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
specific thing that happened. It's that right there. These,

385
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
no one will stop applauding because they're afraid they're going

386
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
to get ratted out by their, by everyone else. Yeah. Well,

387
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
by the people who are in fact watching. And I mean, you know,

388
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
with by by the end by by the by the collapse of East

389
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Germany, one third of the people were in for in

390
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
formers for the state. And so if you had a family of six

391
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
people, two of your family members were direct government

392
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
informers. You know, and it's, it's so, it's, it's creepy

393
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
in some sense. And it's a very weak word to use in this

394
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
situation. But when I was at New York University talking to

395
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Jonathan Height about, I don't know, it was about a few

396
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
months ago. He just wrote that book called The

397
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Carling of the American Mind, you know, and he took me into

398
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
one of the men's washrooms there. And there's a poster on

399
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
the wall asking students to turn each other in for

400
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
instances of bias or offensive speech. And they have a whole

401
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
bureaucracy that's designed to do nothing else. But

402
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
they're not just going to do that. But they're going to

403
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
educate these instances of biased speech. And these posters are

404
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
up on the walls as if this is something to be proud of.

405
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
You know, and the same thing is happening now in

406
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Scotland with the Scottish police are doing exactly the same

407
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
thing. They're asking citizens to turn each other in for

408
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
hate crimes. You know, and the problem with that is the

409
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
fundamental problem with that. And the, the unsolvable

410
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
problem with that is that the people who are

411
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
going to be in the state are going to be in the state.

412
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
And where's the line drawn? It's like, well, anything that

413
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
upsets me that you say is hate. That, and then, and it's

414
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
worse than that. It's like, what happens is the people who

415
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
define hate end up being those who are looking to take

416
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
offense so that they can find someone they can define as a

417
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
victimizer so that they can persecute them morally and

418
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
justify that inner sadism. And those are the people who end up

419
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
in the state. Well, we're doing this to make our society a safe

420
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
place. It's absolutely, it's absolutely dreadful. And to see

421
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
that happening in the UK was just, it's just awful because I mean,

422
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
you know, the UK is a center, a center point of the idea of

423
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
free speech. I mean, a lot of American, obviously, a lot of

424
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
American ideals. America is a great center of free speech, but

425
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
I mean, it's a variation on the English system. So to see that

426
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
happening in the UK is just, it's awful. And to see the

427
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
politics doing this and being, you know, encouraged by the

428
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
politicians and, and to see this put forward as some sort of

429
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000
moral action. It's just, well, it's, it's an echo of this

430
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
kind of catastrophe that we're discussing.

431
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
So I think about that sometimes. And I also have a

432
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
tendency to look at things and not not be too worried about

433
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
like, hey, come on. Yeah. What's really going to happen? Right? And

434
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
that's, yeah, that's actually part of my personality and

435
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
part of that comes from my old job where, hey, I can't

436
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
worry about these little things. So there's some little

437
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
problem going on over there. That's, that's not going to be,

438
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
that's not going to affect us. It's not going to, and you got to

439
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
pay attention a little bit, but make sure it doesn't get out of

440
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
hand. But that thing about speech and you just mentioned the

441
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
the cool lock. So that's a cool lock. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

442
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
They were the Ukrainian, they were the Ukrainian farmers who were

443
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.000
good at farming. When I read this part, it got me worried about

444
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
my own personal laxedasical attitude towards things that I

445
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
think, oh, that's not what we do. Let me read this little

446
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
section about the, about the escalation of the word

447
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
cool act. Yeah. And where it started and where it ended up.

448
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Yeah. That's good. That's so, here we go. In Russian, a

449
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
cool act is amazingly dishonest, rural trader who grows rich

450
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000
not by his own labor, but through someone else's. In every

451
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
locality, even before the revolution, such cool acts could

452
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
be numbered on one's fingers. And the revolution totally

453
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
destroyed their basis of activity. Subsequently after

454
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
1917, by a transfer of meaning, the name cool act began to

455
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000
be applied to all those who in any way hired workers. Even if

456
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
it was only even if it was only when they were temporarily

457
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
short of working hands in their own families. But then

458
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
that doesn't stop there. The inflation of this scathingly

459
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
term of this scathing term, cool, cool act preceded

460
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
relentlessly. And by 1930, all strong peasants in general

461
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
were being so called, all peasants strong in management,

462
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
strong in work, or even strong merely in convictions. The

463
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
term cool act was used to smash the strength of the

464
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
peasantry. And I got to go a little bit further because

465
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
hell of a thing for the workers party to do. Yeah. They

466
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
went further though. Beyond this, in every village, there

467
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
were people who in one way or another had personally gotten

468
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
in the way of the local activists. This was the perfect

469
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
time to settle accounts with them of jealousy and the

470
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
insult. These are the people you were just talking about. A new

471
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
word was needed for these new victims as a class. And it

472
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
was born. By this time, it had no social or an economic

473
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
content whatsoever, but it had a marvelous sound.

474
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Pond Kulakchnik. And that meant a person

475
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
who was the only victim to the

476
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
thing. And it was a different kind of thing.

477
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
And it was a person who was the leading

478
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000
the co-lax, in other words, I consider you an

479
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000
accomplice of the enemy. And that's all it tells. Yeah. Well,

480
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
one of the things I tried to outline in my foreword to the

481
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
bridge version was I was thinking about this idea of

482
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000
the idea of the idea of the foundation that was

483
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
the foundation that was defined by our collective identity. And

484
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
that the proper narrative in relationship to our collective identity is

485
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
one of victim victimizer, which is a replay of the old Marxist

486
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
doctrine of bourgeoisie and proletariat. It's just in its new

487
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
guys. I mean, in that new guys developed at least in

488
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
part in response to the Gulagarch-Pellagal because the old

489
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000
proletariat, bourgeoisie distinction became morally

490
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
unfair. And it's just a very serious point out that you're

491
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
status as a victimizer or a victim is actually the intersection of

492
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
your multiple identities. And so, and that's actually the

493
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Achilles heel of the collectiveist notion. And we can get into

494
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
why that is. But there's a horror that goes along with that

495
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
that people that's not obvious that I think contributed to

496
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
exactly why the Russian Revolution went so horribly wrong.

497
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
And that is that so imagine that I could characterize you

498
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
in five or six different dimensions of group identity. It's pretty easy.

499
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
And while you're male, you're male of a certain age, you're male of

500
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
a certain age and economic class. You have a certain sexual

501
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000
orientation, you have a certain ethnicity. You have a certain race.

502
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
That's six groups right there. And we could continue.

503
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
You know, your parents had a certain socioeconomic class and so

504
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
did your grandparents. And then your ethnic group had a

505
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
certain privilege or luck thereof. And you're a

506
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
tractive or you're not a tractive or you're intelligent or you're

507
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
not intelligent. There's temperamental variability. Like there's all sorts of ways of

508
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
characterizing you according to your group. Okay, now we might say that

509
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
if we were compassionate people that we would take one of those

510
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
group identities or more and look at where your

511
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
dispossessed and victimized. Okay, and we're going to find some

512
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
dimension along which your less privileged than some people.

513
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Like maybe you come from a working class background, despite the fact that

514
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
you're like a straight male. And so you can be a victim on that dimension.

515
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000
And so, and that's kind of, that's at least in part,

516
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
an element of intersectional theory, right? And that maybe

517
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
your, your, your oppression is the product of of your

518
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
multiple victim like identities. But that can easily be

519
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
reversed because it's absolutely the case that I can take any

520
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
person. And I can do a multi-dimensional analysis of their group

521
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
identities. And I can find at least one dimension along which they're the

522
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
perpetrator, not the victim. They're the victimizer, not the victim.

523
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000
And as soon as I can identify a dimension along which they're a

524
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
victimizer, then that justifies their persecution. And so one of the things that you

525
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
saw happening in the Russian Revolution, and it's very much a

526
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
kind of what you just described was that the, the, the, the

527
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
borders of who, who was valiantly accused of being a

528
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
victimizer, essentially expanded to include everyone. And that's

529
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
actually right in, it's, in a perverse sense, it's right because

530
00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.000
if you position yourself properly in, in the historical flow,

531
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
then you should see yourself as a perpetrator and a victim equally.

532
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Well, it's not the right way to see yourself at all, but if you're going to

533
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
play that game, you're going to be on both sides of it. And then that

534
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
issue is, and this is related to your idea about, you know, in your

535
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
opinion, you've got one person who's sadistic. It's like, okay, well,

536
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000
let's even assume that at the beginning of the Russian

537
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Revolution that the vast majority of the people who were motivated by

538
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
communism were actually compassionate with regards to the

539
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000
dispossessed peasantry. Now, I don't believe that, but we could say that

540
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000
that was even a significant minority. Well, the question is, did you just say

541
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000
on it? What was your, what was your hypothetical percentage? Well,

542
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
well, let's say, well, let's say it's 20% or let's even say it's 50% of

543
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
people who are genuinely motivated by compassion for the

544
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
dispossessed. But then there's another minority, maybe we could even

545
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
say it was only 10% to begin with, who weren't motivated by that at all.

546
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
They were motivated by the jealousy and the spite and the, and the, and the

547
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
resentment that socials and it's in describes. And they were the ones who

548
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
are after those to be persecuted. And the thing is, they got

549
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
up her hand really rapidly. And it might be because the carnivorous

550
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
types, the predatory types are much more dangerous and powerful than the

551
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
compassionate types. They'll take them out instantly. We're willing to

552
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
step up and smash someone. Yes. The people that are saying, oh, we just

553
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
want to help. Yes, exactly. Well, and there's someone I actually

554
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000
cited a guy named, I think his name was Walter Latsus in the

555
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
forward, who wrote in a journal called Red Terror that if you were

556
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000
interrogating an enemy of the state, you didn't bother with

557
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
niceties like their individual guilt. That was a bourgeoisie

558
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
conceit. And that's really important thing to keep in mind. What you

559
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
wanted to do is to do a class-based analysis and find out, well, are they

560
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000
a member of, let's say, the coolac or the affiliates of the coolacs,

561
00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
which is a lovely way of expanding your list of potential victims. And then

562
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
you execute accordingly. And that would mean, well, the person that you're

563
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
interrogating, right, or the class member that you're interrogating, and then

564
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
their children, and perhaps also their grandchildren. And Latsus

565
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
himself was eventually executed by the Stella and somebody wrote to me

566
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
after I wrote the forward and told me that that was his eventual

567
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
fate. And I thought, well, talk about standing on a chair and putting the

568
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
news around your own neck and kicking it out from underneath you.

569
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000
It's like, you know, he basically he murdered himself,

570
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
fundamentally. And you know, you could say in some sense, that was the

571
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000
story of the Soviet Union to a tremendous degree.

572
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Yeah, there's one part going back to the ever expanding

573
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000
people that need to be destroyed. There's a point in the book where he

574
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000
starts, he's saying, hey, look, there's insects.

575
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Stalin's just described, or maybe his lenin was describing these

576
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
certain people as insects that need to be destroyed. And then he just

577
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
that that just starts off with, hey, people that are

578
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
browsers, they're insects. And then it just expands and expands.

579
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
And then it's got priests. And then it's got engineers and

580
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
physicians and physicians. And everyone in records.

581
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Yeah, records. That's the word that they use or that he uses in the book

582
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
for, uh, first basically saboteurs. Yeah. And that expands beyond

583
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
comprehension. Yeah, because at every single problem that there is

584
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
is the fault of some person out there that sabotages. And they

585
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000
do this show trial. And he talks about it in the book for, I think

586
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
I think the phrase that he uses is or that they use at the

587
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Russian that the Soviets used was organizers of the famine.

588
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Meaning like, oh, yeah, you're starving. And these people over here,

589
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
they're the reason you're these people that organize the

590
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000
famine. They're the records of production of food.

591
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000
You bet. Well, it was either that, you know, you imagine that

592
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000
you adopt a worldview and that worldview enables you to at least

593
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
in principle organize yourself with other people and to provide you with a certain amount of

594
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
psychological stability. And then things go dreadfully wrong. And then you have a choice

595
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
which is to re-evaluate your worldview, which is of course what

596
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
social medicine does in the Gulagar Capalago in a very deep ways.

597
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Reorganizes entire worldview. Or you can look for reasons why you're right

598
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
and these things are happening. And socialists and talks a lot in the Gulagar

599
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Capalago about, see, he had a moral condendrum when he was in prison and he

600
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
started his moral awakening, let's say. And he was trying to figure out how to

601
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000
treat other people who are imprisoned. He had a real moral condendrum

602
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
when a committed communist was dragged into the Gulag system, which happened all the

603
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000
time. He said those people were in particularly dire

604
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
rights because not only had they been subject to the entire tyrannical weight of the

605
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
deceitful state, but it was at the hands of their own comrades and friends.

606
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:58.000
And then the committed communist would enter the Gulag and they would still be

607
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
in their morally superior phase, right, that their incarceration was a

608
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000
mistake and that things would be set right and that there was nothing wrong with the

609
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
system and they would attempt to justify it. And soleson it's and was never

610
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000
sure how to react to these people ethically because on the one hand, well, they

611
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000
were devastated because now they were political prisoners and maybe they got a

612
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
20-year sentence and they were in terrible stripped of their family and just

613
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
ruined. But on the other hand, they were still avid supporters of the very

614
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:34.000
fist that had crushed them. And so his eventual conclusion was that until they

615
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000
broke and repented, they weren't to be allied with. They were still

616
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
essentially on the side of the while of the perpetrator and it seems to me that

617
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:52.000
that's right, that's that's unrepentant sin, let's say. And it isn't until you

618
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
what would you say? Until you take responsibility for your own complicitness in

619
00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000
your unfair interrogation that you get to join the ranks of of of

620
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:11.000
valuable and suffering humanity again. And so yeah, it's the extension of the

621
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:17.000
persecution is really something that's horrifying to see how who

622
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
constituted a victimizer, the ranks of who constituted a victimizer just grew and

623
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
grew and grew. One of the most shocking groups of people that ended up in

624
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
the Gulag's were the dam Soviet soldiers that had just got back to the

625
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
fight. Just not out of the same sort of thing you can't make up.

626
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Yeah, you can't make that up. I'm getting the solution to who was like in

627
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.000
close combat with the enemy. And he wrote a letter to one of his buddies and

628
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
said, yeah, this doesn't seem like to be a great decision by Stalin.

629
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Yeah. And next thing you know, he's in prison. Yeah, well, the

630
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Stalin, Stalin decided that, yeah, this is something that you can't you can't

631
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
believe this. Well, it is, there is this like it's like, you know, if there's

632
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
something satanic at the bottom of this, you know, mythologically speaking,

633
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000
there's also something that's like a cosmic, it's like cosmic black humor.

634
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000
It's like the sign on Auschwitz that said, work will set you free. You know,

635
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
if that's a joke, right, it's a, it's a terrible, terrible, dark joke.

636
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000
And so much of this has the element of exactly that kind of surreal,

637
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.000
I hate to say humor, but it's, it's right. I mean, Stalin decided that the,

638
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000
okay, so the Soviet prisoners of war were not covered by the Geneva

639
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Convention for the treatment of prisoners of war, because Stalin refused

640
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
to sign that agreement. So like if you were an allied prisoner of the

641
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Germans, it wasn't like you were having a great time of it. Like food was

642
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
in short supply and you were treated pretty brutally, but the Soviets were kept

643
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000
separately and they were doing so badly that the Allies used to throw

644
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
food packets over the fence when that was an option. So the Soviet prisoners

645
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000
of war were treated absolutely dreadfully and, and, and Stalin didn't

646
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
care about that. And then when they were released and went back to the

647
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Soviet Union, his dictum was that because they had been exposed to the

648
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000
capitalist West or even the Nazi West for that matter that they had now

649
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000
been intolerably corrupted on ideological grounds and had to be put in the

650
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
prison camps. So that was the, that was your destiny as, you know, I mean,

651
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000
first of all, you were a frontline Russian soldier, which was just

652
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
brutal beyond belief. Their army was completely unprepared for Hitler's

653
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000
invasion because Stalin trusted Hitler in his strange way. And so they

654
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000
were completely unprepared. And of course, then fighting in the Soviet Union

655
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000
with its winters, I mean, you just, you just can't imagine what that

656
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000
must have been like. And then to be thrown in a prisoner of war camp

657
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
at the bottom of the wrong and then to be brought back to your country.

658
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
And then to be imprisoned as a traitor because as a class you'd be

659
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.000
exposed to the wrong ideology. It's like you just, it's, it's, it's

660
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:11.000
unimaginably vile and surreal at the same time. And it, it, it,

661
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000
it, it, it shake your head. It, for me, well, it's such a shock to read the

662
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:21.000
Gulagkar Capelago. It, it, it, it, it just can't, it's, it's, it's like

663
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000
it's like it, it isn't like Dante's in front of. It's like a trip into

664
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000
hell. Yeah, yeah, and I guess you're, that's what I was trying to say

665
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000
with when we started this conversation, I was trying to say that

666
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000
it's like you're watching this, like like you said, it's like a

667
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000
bad comedy movie. And you'd think, well, that's that'd be really

668
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000
that. You'd think, you know, when you, when you take a comedy, one of

669
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000
the things, one of the ways you can make people laugh is to take something

670
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000
ordinary and maybe make it much more extreme in the more extreme.

671
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000
You make it the more funny it becomes. That's what, like, happened here.

672
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000
You're looking at this thing going, hey, oh, yeah, they, they seem to be trying to

673
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000
make this funny because who, in, could ever conceive that you could

674
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000
take your front line soldiers who are captured and in, in misery.

675
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000
And when they return home, instead of treating them like heroes,

676
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000
instead, you put them back into a prison. We're swan, even. You can't even,

677
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
you can't even, that's just, that's, no, you can't make this stuff.

678
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
You can't make it up. No, did you see, I believe that movie was the

679
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000
death of Stalin? I did not see it. That's worth seeing because it's,

680
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000
it's very interesting because one of the things about that movie is that

681
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000
it captures that surreal element because it's a black comedy, you know,

682
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
and, and there are comical things happening in the movie in that

683
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
terrible dark way, constantly, at the same time that in the background

684
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000
genuinely terrible things are happening. So it's that horrible,

685
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000
it's, it's got that horrible, satirical flavor that runs through books

686
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000
like the Gulagar Capelago, where you think, well, there's just no,

687
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
this is so absurd that there's no possible way it could have occurred.

688
00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
And yet, that's not only did it happen, there was like a contest

689
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000
to top the absurdity, you know, to, to, to consider the engineers, for example,

690
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000
records is, well, these people were building the, so the,

691
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
it's system to the degree that it was built, and then to turn around and

692
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000
accuse exactly those people of being the ones who destroy and

693
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000
undermine it. It's, it's, it's part of, I really think that

694
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000
what's, what underlies this, whatever this is. And I think this is

695
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.000
what manifests itself in the worst of the leftist collectivism is a real

696
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000
hatred for anything that smacks of competence at all. Like, I, I tried to

697
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000
imagine those Russian villages, because I come from a small town, a

698
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000
small northern town too. So I kind of, I tried to imagine, so imagine

699
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000
that you're in an isolated village, and it's a peasant village,

700
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000
and the peasants weren't freed that long ago, right? They were

701
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000
basically surfs until, until about the middle of the second half of the

702
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000
19th century. And so they had been emancipated, and then some of

703
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000
those people who were emancipated, got a little bit of land, and

704
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000
started to have a life, you know, it started to be successful pezons.

705
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000
And they were also the people that grew the bulk of the crops, because

706
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000
what you see happening in any productive domain is that a small

707
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000
percentage of people do almost all the productive work. So there's

708
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000
a small percentage of productive farmers who grew all the crops,

709
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000
right? And then there's all sorts of farmers who were only

710
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000
farmers by name, and they weren't successful at all. So you have,

711
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000
and then there was a certain relationship between being

712
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000
productive as a farmer, and developing some wealth, maybe had a house

713
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000
and maybe you could hire a person or two, you know, and which you

714
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000
think would actually be a good thing, especially if you're also

715
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000
growing food. Okay, so imagine you get a village, and now there's

716
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000
a bit of a socioeconomic pyramid, and there's some people that

717
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000
are doing well, and they're really, and there are, and it isn't

718
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000
the crooked people that are really annoying, though people who, like

719
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000
the genuine cool acts, let's say that that small percentage of

720
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.000
psychopathic types who were basically profiting criminally off the

721
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000
efforts of others. Those aren't so annoying those people because

722
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000
they're rich, but they don't deserve it. And so they don't

723
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000
stand towards you as a moral ideal that shames you. But the

724
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000
really annoying people are the ones who are doing well and

725
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000
deserve it, especially if you're someone who's doing nothing and

726
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000
is better. Okay, so now, so there's the village, and you've

727
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
got your people who are doing all right, and then you've got a huge

728
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000
strad of people who aren't upset about the people who are doing

729
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000
well, they might even admire them and be happy that they're

730
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000
around because they're making the community thrive and growing

731
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000
some food. Then you have this little strad at the bottom of

732
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000
people who are near-do wells and on the more psychopathic end of

733
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000
things, and they're bitter and resentful and waiting for their

734
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000
bloody opportunity. And then the communist intellectuals

735
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000
come into town and say, you know those people that are doing

736
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000
well, they actually, everything they've got is ill-

737
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:52.000
gotten and they stole it and they stole it from you from you.

738
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000
And look at how badly you're doing and the reason you're doing

739
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000
badly is because these people who are lording it over you and

740
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000
who have all this creature comfort, they took that from you.

741
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000
It's yours by right. And so then all that resentment and

742
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000
jealousy and hatred and rage alcohol fueled as you might well

743
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000
imagine has this moral reason to go with pitchforks and

744
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000
any in a mob and surround those houses and to strip them of everything

745
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000
they have and to rape the women and to kill the occupants or to

746
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
ship them off to the middle of Siberia when they were they

747
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
froze to death because there were no or died of dysentery or

748
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.000
or whatever other plague managed to, you know, we've

749
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000
its way through these camps. And so you have the intellectuals

750
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.000
providing the moral rationale for the worst ethical actors in

751
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
these small villages doing the worst possible things under the

752
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.000
guys of compassion. Right. And that's part of that victim

753
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000
victimizer narrative. It's just. And you know, like you can

754
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000
imagine that, you can imagine a dark night, you can imagine

755
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
the winter, you can imagine the alcohol, you can imagine the

756
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000
rage that fuels these people who are drinking too much in the

757
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000
pubs that have been sitting there for the last 20 years like

758
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000
what would you say eating up their own souls with resentment and

759
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000
bitterness and then someone comes in and says you're the true

760
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000
victim here and here's the people that you can go after. And

761
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000
then like if you play that on your imagination, you get some real

762
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000
sense of exactly what sort of horror that would produce. You

763
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000
know, you think about the rape, for example, or just the

764
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.000
theft or but it's the rape that you can really think about

765
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000
as as absolute revenge for all that bitter resentment all

766
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.000
fueled by the fact that, you know, you'd sat there for the

767
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000
last 20 years being completely goddamn useless and bitter

768
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.000
hatred and angry and and and and fantasizing about the day

769
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000
that would come where you'd have your opportunity. God and then

770
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000
the whole country and that was the whole country.

771
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Just unbelievable. Yeah, I think he spells that out very

772
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000
clearly and he says it's you know what he's saying. You know,

773
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.000
I'm saying that you got a psychopath in your plateau. He

774
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:07.000
saying that psychopath all that psychopath needs to flip is is the

775
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000
is someone to tell him that's the right thing to do. And that's

776
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
exactly what happened when you said that's it. That's it.

777
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Guys that were slightly psychopathic. Yeah. And then it

778
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.000
becomes okay. I'm the I'm the head psychopath and you're in my

779
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000
village. And you're let's say you're one of those people

780
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
that are in the middle. Well, who's side are you going to be on?

781
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000
I'm a psychopath if you if you're not on my side, I'm going to

782
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000
kill you next. Yeah. So you go, well, no, I'm on your side too.

783
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.000
And that's what it was. Well, and it doesn't take luck. It's not like

784
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:40.000
it takes much pressure on people to have them fold. I mean, one of

785
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000
the things you see you see happening right now in our

786
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000
cultures. That's happening to people all the time with these

787
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Twitter wars. You know, someone will say something. They'll

788
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000
express an opinion and then they'll get mobbed by and but

789
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000
only abstractly, right? It's not like there's pitch for

790
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.000
wielding mobs at their house. And I'm not making light of it.

791
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.000
It's no, it's no pleasant thing to be mobbed on Twitter. But

792
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000
that's an abstraction compared to these people showing up at

793
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.000
your house. And what will happen is that people will go

794
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000
through an object apology. You know, and they'll say, well, I

795
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000
really didn't mean it. And now I understand what my privileges and

796
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000
I see how what I said could have been very hurtful to people. And

797
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000
you know, they they wander through that entire apology and fold

798
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.000
almost instantly. And that's under almost almost no pressure.

799
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Compared to what real pressure is. And real pressure is when the

800
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000
wolves are actually at your door rather than just barking

801
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000
off in the distance. But people will fold just when they're

802
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000
barking in the distance. So there's one lawyer that he talks

803
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000
about in here is the same thing as the story that you described.

804
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000
And I forget the guy's name. But this guy was like the premier

805
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:52.000
prosecuting lawyer for the Soviet government. And he just

806
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.000
rips people apart over and over again. And as you read about

807
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000
what happens in sure enough, he's one of the guys that didn't

808
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000
up on the offensive and yeah. Being executed. Yeah. Like

809
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:09.000
they still see people. They built a place of butchery and

810
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000
then through themselves into it. You know, that's an

811
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000
and you see. So it's in documents this very carefully. I mean

812
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Stalin killed all the people who were foremost actors in

813
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000
the Russian Revolution. Right. So I mean everyone was fed

814
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000
into the great grinding machine. So and and Stalin

815
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.000
himself. I mean it looked to me like see he got

816
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000
himself into something approximating a positive feedback loop

817
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000
which is very dangerous thing to have happened. And I think

818
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000
socializing doesn't a lovely job of detailing this as well.

819
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.000
So it's like imagine that I have a fair amount of content

820
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.000
for people to begin with. And then I find that people are

821
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.000
not trusting person and I find that I'm very paranoid about

822
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
the fact that people are lying to me. And then I develop a

823
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000
certain amount of power and a reputation. Well then people

824
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.000
really do start lying to me all the time in every gesture.

825
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000
You know, because every time they come near me they're

826
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000
absolutely terrified and they're going to tell me anything

827
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000
that I want to hear. And of course then all that does

828
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.000
is validate my view of how pathetic and contemptible

829
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.000
everyone is. And so in the more that view gets validated

830
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000
the more I think that it's okay to destroy people because

831
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
look at how pathetic and contemptible they are, how they always

832
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000
lie. And all that means is that they lie even more. And so this

833
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000
whole thing just spirals out of control. And you know,

834
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Stalin basically started out as as the brutal

835
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.000
enforcement henchmen for henchmen for Lenin, right?

836
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000
The killer for hire. And not like Lenin was above

837
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.000
that sort of thing himself. But he trained Stalin. And

838
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:48.000
then Stalin's proclivity to be murderous just kept

839
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000
expanding without limit. Right? First of all, it was

840
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000
individuals and then it was groups and then it was

841
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000
nations and then well by the end of his life. Well what

842
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000
was it the plot to destroy the entire world?

843
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:03.000
To initiate the third world war to wipe out Europe to

844
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:07.000
maybe destroy everything. And like there's no limit.

845
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.000
There was no limit to that. You know, and there's some

846
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.000
evidence that that's perhaps why he was killed. You know,

847
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000
because Stalin himself even went too far for the horrible

848
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:24.000
horrible, what semi. The corrupted

849
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:29.000
compatriots that he had arranged around himself. He went too far

850
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000
even for them. And thank God for that, you know, but

851
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:38.000
yeah, it's absolute. I mean, the thing that the

852
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Gulagkar, Gulagkar, Gulagkar, Gulagkar, Gulagkar

853
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000
did for me. And this was also in keeping as a

854
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000
consequence, also of reading Yung at the same time, but

855
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.000
it was certainly the Gulagkar in large part that it

856
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.000
did it. I would say that in some sense it's scared me

857
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.000
straight. I thought I see the consequences of unethical

858
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:03.000
behavior deceit the willingness to turn a blind eye.

859
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000
So even sins of a mission rather than sins of commission,

860
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000
just to turn a blind eye. The consequences of that are

861
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:14.000
so absolutely dreadful that it's not acceptable. And I

862
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
think that's the right lesson from the 20th century. It's that

863
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:21.000
you, you, you, you have a much more important moral

864
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.000
role to play in keeping things straight than you want to

865
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000
believe. You know, people think, well, my life is

866
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
basically meaningless. It's like, well, that's quite

867
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.000
terrifying. It's like, yeah, it's kind of terrifying, but

868
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.000
it means you don't have any responsibility. So there's a

869
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000
big advantage to thinking that. You know, if nothing you do

870
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000
matters, then nothing you do matters. And so you can do

871
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.000
whatever you want. And that's horrifying in a nihilistic

872
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000
sort of way, but there's another kind of horror that's more

873
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000
associated, I think, with the horror of Hellfire that was

874
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000
characteristic of the medieval Christian view is which is

875
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000
something like, and if you strip it of its metaphysics,

876
00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000
it's something like, no, you don't get it. The things you do

877
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
actually do, the things you do or don't do, they actually

878
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
don't matter. And they tilt the world towards, you know, something

879
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
approximating good, let's say, or towards something that very

880
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
closely approximates Hell, and that's actually on you.

881
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
It's literally your fault. It's literally your responsibility.

882
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
It's like, man, that's a terrifying idea, but I can't see

883
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000
how you can read this literature without coming to that

884
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
conclusion. Like, it wasn't one that I wanted to leap to, you know,

885
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
because it's sort of the ultimate in horrifying conclusions that

886
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
that everybody who participated in this system was that fault for

887
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
all of it. And on Dusty F ski made the same sorts of claims in

888
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
the last part of the 19th century. I mean, he was a very weird,

889
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
mystical sort of person, you know, and he made claims or some of

890
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
his characters to it, but on his behalf that, you know, not only are

891
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
you responsible for everything you do, but in some sense you're

892
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
responsible for everything that everyone else does too, and you

893
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
know, obviously there's a way in which that isn't true.

894
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000
You know, it's delusional in some sense, but there's another way in

895
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
which it actually is true, you know, and so.

896
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Well, I wrote a book called Extreme Ownership, and it's very

897
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000
interesting. So all this is a whole, um, fought here. So, you know,

898
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
when I read the book about face, which is not about leadership.

899
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
It's not a leadership book. It's a book about a guy that was in

900
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
the leadership position, but he doesn't say, here's how you lead.

901
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Here's what you do here. It's a book about his experience and what I

902
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
took away from it, especially because I was in leadership positions

903
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000
in the military and combat situations that I started seeing all

904
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
these leadership things that he did, and there's all this

905
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000
crossover because, for instance, and so for me, the crossover

906
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
was, well, I started learning about tactics when I was a young kid

907
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
because I was in the military as in the SEAL teams, and you had to

908
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
learn about how to fire maneuver. Like, that's what you do.

909
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
And then so you start learning about leadership, and then I started

910
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
training a lot of jiu-jitsu, and so those things kind of all

911
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
fit together. And it's very strange how those things started

912
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000
to weave together in my head that, oh, if on the battlefield,

913
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
if you want to attack the enemy, you don't do it head on.

914
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
You flank them. You distract them and then you flank them.

915
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
You come in from the outside. In jiu-jitsu, if you want to

916
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
submit your opponent, you don't just grab their arm. No, you

917
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
start to choke them. And while they're defending the

918
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000
choke, then you get their arm. And as a leader, if you want somebody

919
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
to do something, you just don't bark that order at them.

920
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
You flank them and you let them understand why it's happening.

921
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And when I started this podcast that I do, I would start it

922
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
off by saying, in the beginning, I'd say, that's a podcast about

923
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000
leadership viewed through the lens of war and atrocity.

924
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
And the more I did it, it didn't take me very long.

925
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Where I was saying, well, it's actually a podcast about human nature.

926
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Really is what it's actually about because the better you

927
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
understand human beings, the better you'll be able to do as a

928
01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
leader because you'll understand what's happening with those

929
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
dynamics, which I guess is now leading me into some sort of

930
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
psychology. You're just kind of where you ended up with of of you

931
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
read this book. And you said you were studying political

932
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
science when you read this book. And then you said, oh, you

933
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
looked at the psychology of it. And an example that you just

934
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
brought up. And this is just what you learn when you read

935
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
and when you understand history and when you understand the way people

936
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000
think, Stalin surrounded himself with people that would say yes to

937
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
him. And anybody that didn't say yes to him, he killed them.

938
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
And I'll say this again. I'll talk to military.

939
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I also killed you if you said yes.

940
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Yeah, the military for sure, but also any business

941
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
leader, we talked to business leaders all the time.

942
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
And you don't want people. You don't want your

943
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
subordinates or your superiors. When you tell them what to do,

944
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
just nod their head and say yes, you don't want that.

945
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Now, the immediate thought, especially for a military guy,

946
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
they think there's nothing would make my job easier.

947
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Then if I bark in order you Jordan, you work from your

948
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
private and on a captain and I bark in order you just

949
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
shut up and go do it. That seems like the best thing in the

950
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
world. It's absolutely not true. Because there's things

951
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
that you know on the front lines that I don't know.

952
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
And if I really want to be a good leader, I want you to

953
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
push back on me and say, hey, boss, we don't want to do that.

954
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Here's what's going on. Let me tell you the situation.

955
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
And instead of me, you want to be able to do that.

956
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
You want to be able to teach your subordinates to do that without

957
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
being in subordinate, right? Because then it's not a

958
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
power play. It's that your interests are aligned.

959
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Our interests are aligned. And I actually, when I talk to the

960
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
subordinates because I talk to subordinates too.

961
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Yeah. And I say, listen, when you say something to your boss,

962
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
you don't say why the hell are we doing that, boss?

963
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Yes. You actually have to be very tacky.

964
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Yeah, exactly. Hey, hey, boss.

965
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I want to make sure I'm executing this exactly how you want to

966
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
can you explain to me why we're doing this?

967
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
So I can really, really make it happen out there in the field.

968
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Yeah. And that's a key thing.

969
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:58.000
So these ideas of psychology, I guess, now is I hate to use that

970
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
word, but because I've just called a human nature, but these ideas

971
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
they all kind of come together. And so now you're talking about

972
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
ownership, right? Extreme ownership. And this idea that,

973
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
hey, I'm responsible for everything. And so here's what I get from

974
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
a leader. They'll say, well, whether it's a business leader or

975
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
it's very easy to use a military leader. So I'll get a

976
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
platoon commander. My machine gunner shot in the wrong direction.

977
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000
How can that be my fault? Because my machine gunner shot in the wrong

978
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
direction. I'm not holding his weapon. I'm not pulling his

979
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
trigger. How can that possibly be my fault? That's not my fault.

980
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Wrong.

981
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Who's in charge of that machine gunner? Who's in charge of making sure he

982
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
understands what it's field of his own fire? Who's in charge of making sure he

983
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
understands when and where he's allowed to shoot you are. You're the boss.

984
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
This is absolutely your fault. How did another interesting example of

985
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
the weather? The weather's bad. We couldn't execute our mission.

986
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
That's why we failed because we couldn't launch our helicopter.

987
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Yeah, it's not my fault. Yeah. That's a hard one to argue against.

988
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Yeah. Except for the fact that if you're a good leader, you'll say,

989
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
hey, here's our plan. We're going to use these helicopters.

990
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And here's our contingency plan. If there's bad weather. If you don't take that

991
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
ownership of what's going on, if you don't take responsibility for it,

992
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
you're not going to change it. You're not going to fix it. And that

993
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
means you're never going to get any better. You're not going to win.

994
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Right. But the minute you as in this and obviously this applies to

995
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
people to purple. And you know, you tell people to take responsibility.

996
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I've, you know, tell them to take ownership of what's going on in your

997
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
world. It's the same thing. But at the end of the day.

998
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Well, it's also, it's also seems to me to be the case. And I think that this

999
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.000
is part of the ethic that's embedded in in it's deeply embedded in

1000
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Christianity with the idea that the idea that the ultimate sacrifice that

1001
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
you can offer to the world is the sacrifice of yourself. So like,

1002
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
well, imagine that you have to sacrifice something to set the world

1003
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
right while you do obviously because you have to give up things now

1004
01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000
in order to make things better in the future. So the sacrificial idea is a

1005
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000
little bit more important than the question might be, well, well, if you're going to

1006
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
sacrifice something, is it going to be someone else or is it going to be you?

1007
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
And I really think that's the fundamental question. And the right answer to that is

1008
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
that it's going to be you. It's your fault. Right. You take that on or at

1009
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
least you take on that responsibility. And it is, it's a weird thing.

1010
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Weirdly difficult. It distinguish fault and responsibility. I think

1011
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
responsibility is the better way of thinking about it. But it's tied in with

1012
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
fault. If it doesn't go right, if it isn't going right, it's because you're not

1013
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
good enough. Now, that can be crushing. There is a problem with that.

1014
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Like, and you see sometimes people who develop like psychotic depression.

1015
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:44.000
And they suffer from a delusional condition in some sense that the entire

1016
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000
moral catastrophe of the world is literally their fault. And that's not,

1017
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
there's an element of that that's that's not productive. Although there's a

1018
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
lot of things that are really not good. And it's hard to find the balance so that

1019
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
you can take on that responsibility without it is simultaneously being

1020
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
a crushing weight because there's a lot of things in the world that are really

1021
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000
not good. And if they're your fault, well, that's rather hard on you.

1022
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
I mean, one of the things that the Catholic Church does to help people with

1023
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
that is that it gives them the opportunity to sort of wash their

1024
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
sins off themselves. Right. You can go to church and you can say, well, look,

1025
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.000
here's a bunch of ways that I've been being not who I could be. And the

1026
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
church authorities say, well, you know, that's not good. And you should

1027
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
straighten up and all of that and fly right. But human beings are

1028
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:38.000
fallible and you're fallible. And we can't just crush you because of

1029
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
your insufficiency. So we'll wash the slate clean and you can go out there

1030
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
and try again. And it's very hard to get the balance between those things

1031
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.000
right so that you can take the responsibility on without being crushed by it.

1032
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000
But but it's still the case that it seems to me that it's either your

1033
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000
fault or it's someone else's. And as soon as it's someone else's, then

1034
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000
you better be careful because that idea that it's someone else's is

1035
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
definitely going to appeal to the worst in you. That's definitely going to

1036
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.000
happen. And if you don't see that, then your naive or willfully blind

1037
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000
and all that is going to do all that's all that that is going to do is

1038
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000
make the situation worse. Yeah, especially because if it's not my fault and

1039
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
it's your fault and I can't control you. What do I do about it? I sit there

1040
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000
and just suffer the consequences of the situation as opposed to, okay,

1041
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
here's what's going on. I'm going to take responsibility on our ship

1042
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
for them to change it. Make it happen. You talked about

1043
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
turning a blind eye. And earlier you talked about turning a blind eye

1044
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:46.000
to the truth to a situation. And I know there's a point in this book

1045
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000
where he talks about the, he's got a buddy that says, the amnesty is

1046
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000
coming. Right. Amnesty is coming. Let's just keep our mouth shut.

1047
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Let's do what we're told to do and we'll get, you know, we'll get out

1048
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000
and we'll get out. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, a social distance

1049
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
says, he said, okay, yeah. And then he says to himself, wait a minute.

1050
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:16.000
If I'm not, if I'm not living in order to live, then is it worth it?

1051
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Mm-hmm. And this is a question that I get asked a lot

1052
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.000
because people get themselves into situations where they've lost

1053
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000
some kind of control, whether it's there in a crappy job or they've got a

1054
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000
bad boss or whatever, maybe they're in a bad relationship,

1055
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.000
maybe their families met, but they're in a situation. And they,

1056
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.000
and they don't know what to do. And part of them, I think,

1057
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:50.000
anticipate the answer from me to be listened. Hey, listen, if you're not,

1058
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
if you're not living in order to live, then that's wrong.

1059
01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Mm-hmm. But what I actually tell them, universally almost,

1060
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
and there's a couple situations where it goes outside this,

1061
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000
but what I tell them is what you need to do right now is you need to

1062
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000
play the game. You need to play the game to get the situation

1063
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
to a point where you can act, right? So if you're, you got a bad boss,

1064
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
right? Oh, okay, you got a bad boss. I want to tell this guy to go

1065
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
to go screw himself. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, hey, guess what I'm going to do?

1066
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
When my boss tells me something to do that doesn't make much sense,

1067
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to do it. And I'm going to do it

1068
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000
well. And what am I doing? I'm building that relationship with him.

1069
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
He's starting to trust me. And these are going to tell me,

1070
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
to do something else. Now, these things are massive,

1071
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
catastrophes. It's like he's telling me to do something,

1072
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
maybe there's a better way to do it. You don't need to do it that way.

1073
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Mm-hmm. And I'm going to play that game. And I'm going to build up that

1074
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
relationship. Now, when eventually he tells me to do something that is

1075
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
totally stupid or it's going to cost lives or money,

1076
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
then when I say, hey, boss, that's not a great way to do it.

1077
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I think I know a better way could we try something else? He actually will

1078
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
listen to me. So I'm going to play the game a little bit.

1079
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000
And I'll tell you, my gut instinct. If now, I guess it's easy to look

1080
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000
from the outside and say, hey, if I was in this prison camp,

1081
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
my gut instinct is like, okay, jok, or you know, you've been through these

1082
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
kind of things before, play the game. You're going to play the game.

1083
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Which is horrifying. Because part of playing that game to the

1084
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000
fullest extent here or in an Aussie prison camp would be coming a

1085
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
couple. Oh, you're playing the game. Yeah. You're playing the game. Yeah.

1086
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
So, and that's really the outline that the things that I said that are

1087
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
outline, I always make the caveat that if you're getting asked to do

1088
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
something that's e-moral, illegal, or unethical, then you actually have a

1089
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
duty to say, no, I'm not going to do that. No, that's the line,

1090
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
which you know, which you reach that line in the sand with Bill C.

1091
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:49.000
16, which is, hey, I'm not going to do this. But the idea that

1092
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:55.000
sometimes you got to play the game. And sometimes even from you, when you

1093
01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.000
just said to me, you know, sometimes you, it's not right to turn a blind

1094
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:06.000
eye on things. And it's like, sometimes you have to. If you want to

1095
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000
get yourself to a position, like, my, my, my, my, my, it seems to me that

1096
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000
you're making a distinction between discipline and strategy, like,

1097
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.000
you know, and, and, and, and, and, like, impulsive moral responding, you know,

1098
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
like, let's say that you are in a situation where you have a boss who's

1099
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000
intolerable, and maybe what you'd like to do, you know, the resentment

1100
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
has built up over five years, and you'd like to go in there and, and

1101
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
yell at him and tell him everything you think. And you think, well, that's

1102
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
the truth. It's like, well, it's actually, it's not a very

1103
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
sophisticated truth, because you're doing a shallow and impulsive

1104
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000
analysis of the situation. Like, it would have been the case

1105
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:48.000
that you've already compromised yourself in 500 ways, and I'll get back

1106
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000
to the playing the game issue, because you do have to discipline yourself

1107
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
too, and, and you have to discipline yourself to, to some degree by

1108
01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000
allowing yourself to do arbitrary things that are part of the

1109
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
system, right? That's a necessary part of discipline. And

1110
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.000
discriminating that from compliance with unethical activity is very

1111
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000
difficult. So that's a hard situation. But let's say,

1112
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
you're going to counsel someone who has an intolerable boss, and they

1113
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
come in and they're right at the end of their tether, because maybe

1114
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
that's why they come for counseling. They say, I really want to

1115
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
tell that son of a bitch, what I think of it, and you think, well,

1116
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
wait a second here. Okay. First of all, you've already

1117
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:33.000
eradicated from the list of reasonable possibilities that

1118
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000
decision by failing to say small things that you could have

1119
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
said all the way along. And it's not like you can just all

1120
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
of a sudden, blurred all of that out now, and that wipes the

1121
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000
slate clean in that constitutes truth. It's too unsophisticated.

1122
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000
So let's think, okay. So what is it that you want? Well, I don't

1123
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000
want this job anymore. It's like, okay. Now, let's actually have a

1124
01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
strategy about this then. You don't want this job anymore. Can you

1125
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000
get another job? Well, I don't think so. Well, so you can't

1126
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
just quit. Well, no, I can't because then I don't have any money

1127
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
and my family depends on the job. It's like, okay. So you can't

1128
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000
just stop this. That's not a viable solution. You go out of the

1129
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000
frying pan into the fire, or you know, you suck, you substitute

1130
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
one set of unethical actions for another set of unethical

1131
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
actions that are even worse. That's not helpful. All right. So

1132
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000
let's start thinking about what exactly it is that you want.

1133
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000
It's like, well, maybe I want a better job. I want to work for

1134
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
someone who's more reasonable. Okay. So what's stopping you?

1135
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Well, I don't have my CV in order. My resume isn't up to

1136
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
date. Well, why is that? Well, I haven't done it for five years and

1137
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
I don't like doing it. Well, why is that? Well, because I'm kind of

1138
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
embarrassed about it because it has holes in it. And it shows where

1139
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
I'm lack of a day's at call and where I'm not prepared. It's like,

1140
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
okay, how many things are there like that? Well, there's a bunch of

1141
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
things. And they're all associated with how I procrastinated in the

1142
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
past. It's like, okay, what are we going to do to rectify that?

1143
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000
So I'll say to people, why don't you update your CV? That's what

1144
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
we'll do first. Because if you're going to look for a different

1145
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
job, I'm not saying you're going to look for a different job. But if

1146
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
you're going to look for a different job, you're not going to

1147
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000
unless your CV is updated. So why don't you go? Unless you can get a

1148
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
good recommendation from this boss that's a tyrant. And so that's right.

1149
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000
There's you got to play the game. There's ten strategic

1150
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000
actions that you're going to have to take in order to make

1151
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
yourself able to move laterally or up. And the truth is

1152
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
isn't going in and yelling at your boss and telling him everything

1153
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
you think about it. The truth is trying to figure out

1154
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000
the very, very difficult process of how you put yourself in a better

1155
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
position. And that, like one of the things that's quite

1156
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
fun about this lecture tour is the letters that I receive or the

1157
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
stories that people tell me about switching jobs. Because they

1158
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
do realize that they're, and I often talk to people about

1159
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000
consulting their resentment. Resentments are really useful

1160
01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000
emotion. Like it's really dangerous. It's one of the most

1161
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
dangerous psychological states I believe, but it's unbelievably

1162
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.000
useful because resentment usually only means one of two things.

1163
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.000
It either means quit whining and take it on because you're

1164
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000
immature or it means you're allowing yourself to be taken

1165
01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000
advantage of and you have something to say or do. And so you

1166
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
want to sort out the first part and find out if you're just being

1167
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000
immature and you can think that through and you can talk to people.

1168
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
But if it's the second, it's like no, you've compromised

1169
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000
yourself in a variety of ways and you have to figure out how to

1170
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
get out of that. And if you're resentful, that's evidence that

1171
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
you have in fact done that. Okay, so now that issue would be,

1172
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
well, how can you set your life up so that you can be without that

1173
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
resentment? And so that's when you start to develop a

1174
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000
strategy for, you know, and there's actually an adventure

1175
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
in this too. I mean, I've had a number of clients who have been

1176
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
in jobs that they didn't like at all. And you know, they were

1177
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000
tyrannized by someone, for example, and they were also working

1178
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
below their hypothetical level and we'd put together a plan.

1179
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000
It's like, okay, you're going to make three times as much money in five

1180
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000
years. That's the plan. But like, that's not going to be simple.

1181
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
So there's education. You got to educate yourself. Maybe

1182
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
formally, because you've got holes. You got to fix up your

1183
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
resume. You've got to, you've got to overcome your fear of being

1184
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000
interviewed. You have to start sending out like 50

1185
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000
resumes a week on a regular basis and be prepared for a 99

1186
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
percent rejection rate. You, you're going to look for a different

1187
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
job. It's probably going to take six months to a year and almost all

1188
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
of that is going to be rejection. You've got to steal yourself from

1189
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
for that and prepare. And maybe this is going to be a three year

1190
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.000
process. It's no trivial thing. But, you know, it's almost

1191
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000
inevitably, I can't remember a single example where the consequence

1192
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:52.000
of that very careful, detailed, strategic thinking wasn't

1193
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:57.000
massively substantive improvement in socioeconomic

1194
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.000
positioning and a great movement towards improving trajectory.

1195
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000
And there's advantages even along the way, because even before that

1196
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000
happens, the fact that you're taking genuine steps to put yourself in

1197
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000
a better situation immediately starts to reduce your resentment

1198
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
even if it isn't having positive consequences to begin with.

1199
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
But you have to be realistic about it. It's like, look, it's going to

1200
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
be hard to update your CV because you're embarrassed about it and you

1201
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
should be. Right? So no wonder you're embarrassed about it. And then

1202
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.000
you're not very good at it. And there's holes in your story and you

1203
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
can be made nervous easily and you're not a very good advocate for

1204
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
yourself. There's a lot of improvement that needs to be done there.

1205
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.000
And then you have to withstand the punishment of being constantly

1206
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000
rejected when you apply for jobs because the baseline rejection rate,

1207
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
you know, for the typical job applicant is like 99%. It's like

1208
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000
the rejection rate for everything. Is this going to work? No. But if you do it

1209
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000
a hundred times, it might work once. And that's all you need. That's exactly

1210
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:06.000
it. You only need that once. And so the true there isn't to yell at your

1211
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
boss. The true there is to get your life together.

1212
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Yeah. Play the game. You've got to play the game sometimes to

1213
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000
get a strategic win to me. And that's another interesting thing here is

1214
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.000
that when you're in a relationship with a person, you don't want to

1215
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000
get yourself to yourself. As I say, you don't want to surround

1216
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000
yourself with yes men when you're in a leadership position. You also don't

1217
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:36.000
want to be your own personal yes man that just thinks you're great and

1218
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000
agrees with everything that you're doing and won't tell yourself the

1219
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:45.000
hard truth. You know, you can't lie to yourself. Everything,

1220
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:50.000
you know, you can't lie to yourself. You can't lie to yourself.

1221
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
And that course why should I go to it. You know, it's like if you don't tell

1222
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
yourself the truth about what your situation is, it's going to be

1223
01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.000
problematic. Just like if you don't have people on your team above

1224
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
you or below you in the chain of command that tell you the truth, that's

1225
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000
going to be problematic as well. Which is something that's easier. So

1226
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000
the playing the game thing. So are you thinking about that as a

1227
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:16.000
person? You know, like because because it seems to be you're making

1228
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
two cases at the same time. Right. One is that you should obviously

1229
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000
not undertake unethical actions. But then by the same token and

1230
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000
you have to subordinate yourself to the realities of the situation.

1231
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
And I think that that's psychologically true because you're always in

1232
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000
a situation where if you're in an organization, there's kind of an

1233
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000
arbitrary and tyrannical aspect to it because it's never working

1234
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:42.000
perfectly. And then there's the positive aspect to it too. And so

1235
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000
whenever you're doing a job, it could be that you're called upon to do

1236
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.000
things that, well, what would you say that are a necessary part of the

1237
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
operation of the machinery? I guess that would be particularly true in

1238
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
military situations. And let me give you a little just a broad

1239
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:05.000
example, right? You know, my personality and my reputation is that

1240
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000
when I was in the military, it's like, oh, it's jockel. He's not going to

1241
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
you know, if someone tells him to do something, he doesn't want to do.

1242
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000
He's just going to say screw you. We're not doing it. We're doing it my

1243
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000
way. I got the knock. But that was kind of the impression people would

1244
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
get from me. If they didn't know me from the outside, they think, oh,

1245
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000
this guy's a knuckle dragger. He's just going to go forward. He's

1246
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
going to make things happen. And he's not going to listen to anyone else.

1247
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000
That was the impression from the outside. The reality is, hey, you

1248
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.000
can't do that. And be the reality is, what my actual idea, I'd have

1249
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
a young lieutenant would come to me and say, hey, you know, my boss is

1250
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000
to tell me to do this, this, and this. And what they think I was going to

1251
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:47.000
say is like, bro, you don't do that. Stand up. You don't screw

1252
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
you. That doesn't make any sense. And they'd be, they'd get this

1253
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000
look in the rise of surprise. When I'd say, oh, your boss wants

1254
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000
to do that, do it. Do it well. Play the game. That's what I'm

1255
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
telling them to do is play the game because these things are

1256
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
meaningless. It's something, you know, something is pathetic.

1257
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
It's like, oh, you got to fill out a form of certain way.

1258
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000
It's like, hey, shut up and play the game. Even my. So is that a

1259
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000
matter of picking your battles? It certainly is a matter of picking

1260
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000
your battles. And you, as that's part of strategy, right? Like

1261
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.000
everything can't be the war exactly. And it's exactly what it is.

1262
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
But, you know, a good example. And we wrote about it in

1263
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000
that economy of leadership, which is, you know, my friend, my

1264
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
friend. So, guys, it works for me. Lave, Babin. We were getting told to do all this

1265
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
paperwork. You got to, you got fill out these forms. You got to, you got to

1266
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
have a serialized inventory of everything. It's got to be signed

1267
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
off this many days. We need to know the qualifications of each and

1268
01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
every person. And when their qualifications come up, do and all

1269
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000
these just ridiculous paperwork. And Lave came to me. And with

1270
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
the other cartoon commander, guy named Seth, they came to me and

1271
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
said, oh, man, this is bullshit. Why do we got to do all this

1272
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
paperwork? We're, we're here training for war. We're getting ready

1273
01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000
for war. Why we got to do this. And, you know, Lave will tell you,

1274
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.000
his expectation was that I was going to be like, you're right. I'm going

1275
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
to go to the commanding officer and tell him, screw this. We're not doing this

1276
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
stuff. This is crap. We're trying to prepare because we're in training

1277
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:14.000
getting ready to deploy to Iraq. This is crap. We're not doing this.

1278
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.000
And I looked at him and said, oh, we're doing all this paperwork.

1279
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
And not only are we going to do this paperwork, we're going to do it

1280
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000
better than anyone else. And we're going to turn it in before it's

1281
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000
even do. And you know, both him and Seth were kind of taking a

1282
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
back then the fact that I wasn't standing up and saying, we're not doing

1283
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
this. And then I explained to him, here's what we're doing. We're

1284
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
building a relationship with my commanding officer with our

1285
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
commanding officer. We're going to do these little things for him.

1286
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000
We're going to play the game because at some point two things

1287
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
are going to happen. Number one, we want to build trust with my

1288
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
boss. I want my boss to look at me. And when he tells me to do

1289
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
fill out paperwork, he knows it's going to be filled out. If he

1290
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
wants me to take down a building, he knows it's going to get

1291
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
taken out. If he wants me to execute up a large mission, I'll go

1292
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
and get it done. Where Bill, if I can't fill out paperwork

1293
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.000
correctly, how can he trust me to go on a real operation and have

1294
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000
guys lives at risk? So the idea is like, hey, we're going to

1295
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000
play the game. And I think sometimes people start to hear me.

1296
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000
They start to listen to me. And their first instinct is

1297
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
juggle wouldn't put up with this shit. And that's why

1298
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
these, you know, they'll hit me up the same thing. They'll

1299
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000
write me an email, they'll write me a letter. And say, here's

1300
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000
the situation I'm in. Whether it's a boss, whether it's a

1301
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000
military, it's any of them. Whether it's their wife, like, like,

1302
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
my wife expects me not to train you into it. Something is stupid

1303
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
is that, like, my wife won't let me train. It's driving me crazy.

1304
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
It's really starting to bother me. Why won't she? Well, what's

1305
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
the problem? Hey, have you taken her out for dinner? Do you

1306
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000
know what I mean? Like play the damn game a little bit so that

1307
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
you can win strategic. And the same thing I think with your

1308
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000
with the 12 rules, we're like, hey, tell the truth or at least

1309
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000
don't lie. It's like, I get it. But there's a dichotomy in

1310
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000
that statement. And that is if you run around telling the

1311
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
absolute truth to everyone, it's going to be like that Jim

1312
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000
carry movie where he can't say anything that's not 100% true.

1313
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
And he, you know, Gratwoman says, good morning. And he says,

1314
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
you look fat. You know, it's like, one of those, like, that's

1315
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000
not good. And so you got to learn to play the game. And I

1316
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000
guess again, go back to this book. It's like, that's a

1317
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000
lot of stuff called to make in these situations. How much do you

1318
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
play the game? And there's an ethical line that you could

1319
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.000
cross at some point. If I become a capo, hey, you just, you

1320
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000
played the game. And you went too far with it. And just like in

1321
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000
obliterative situation, if I, if you're my boss and I'm just

1322
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
kissing your ass and doing whatever you said, my guys lose

1323
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
respect for me. Yeah, my team will lose respect for me. If you

1324
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
tell me to do something completely stupid. And I say, hey,

1325
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
guys, that's what the boss says. We're doing it. My guys will

1326
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
lose respect for me. And I won't be, I won't be able to

1327
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000
execute missions the way I should. If when the pushback is

1328
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000
proper, I say, hey, hey, boss, that doesn't make any sense.

1329
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000
We shouldn't do that. And I go to the guys and say, listen,

1330
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
I told, I talked to him. We're going to see what he says.

1331
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000
But trust me, if we have to do this, we'll figure out a way to

1332
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000
make it work. Because if you're just the guy that's totally

1333
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000
on board, if you're a brown nose or, right? Your

1334
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
guys will lose respect for you. 100% they will. They will

1335
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
lose respect for you. If you don't play the game at all, and you

1336
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000
push back on everything that your boss says, you're going to,

1337
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
you're not going to hit fire. Yeah, that's another ethical

1338
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
situation. Like if my boss, if you're my boss and you tell me to do

1339
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
something, that's, I don't believe in, or it's like a bad plan.

1340
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000
And I, I draw the line in the sand and say, screw you Jordan.

1341
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
We're not doing it. You can fire me. You're like, okay, fine,

1342
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000
you fire me. You get some, yes, man to come in. He takes

1343
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000
my guys out on the mission and gets them all killed. He didn't

1344
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000
mitigate the risk properly. It's better for me, ethically, to

1345
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
say, hey, look, Jordan, I don't agree with this plan. I really wish

1346
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000
we could do it another way. Is there any way I can flex on it? You

1347
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.000
say, nope, you're doing it this way. It is better for me in many

1348
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000
situations to say, okay, I got it. I'll make good indication of

1349
01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
the complexity of the truth. I mean, one of the rules of thumb that

1350
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.000
I think is worth abiding by. And I guess this is something that

1351
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:08.000
makes me somewhat conservative in some ways is that he

1352
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
should do what everyone else does unless there's a very good

1353
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000
reason not to. And I think that's the same idea that you're

1354
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000
putting forward, which is that if you, if you do fight back against

1355
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
everything, then you're just to rebel without a cause, right? And

1356
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
you discredit yourself entirely. And if you accept everything,

1357
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
well, then you're not even there. And so there's some judicious

1358
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000
analysis of the situation that helps you understand when the

1359
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000
time for action is right. And most of the time, what you're

1360
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000
doing in life is you're doing what other people do. And that's

1361
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000
going along with the game. That's part of being socialized, but

1362
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000
there's going to be times when the right thing to do is to

1363
01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000
break a rule and to do it very carefully. And so, and

1364
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000
there's a scene, I think this is a new testament scene, but

1365
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000
it might be in some of the apocryphal writing. I don't

1366
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000
remember. So Christ is walking down the road on the sabbath.

1367
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.000
And there's a ditch by the road, and it's very hot. And

1368
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000
in the ditch, there's a hole. And in the hole, there's a sheep. And

1369
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
so the sheep is stuck in the hole. And this got shepherd is

1370
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000
trying to get the sheep out of the hole. And Christ walks by and

1371
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000
he says, if you don't understand what you're doing, you're a

1372
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
transgressor of the law and you're cursed. But if you do

1373
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000
understand what you're doing, then you're blessed. So it's

1374
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
it's a perfect example of that, because it's like, if you're

1375
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
okay, now here's your situation, you're a shepherd and you're

1376
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
supposed to be taking care of that sheep, right? But it's the

1377
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Sabbath day. So you're not supposed to be working. Now, if you have

1378
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000
decided, you've thought this through. You think it's the Sabbath day.

1379
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
This is something that everybody needs because everybody needs to

1380
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000
take a rest. And this is a rule I shouldn't break because

1381
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000
everybody needs to take a rest or things degenerate. And I

1382
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
understand that, and I have a lot of respect for it. But I

1383
01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000
think that in this situation, it's still morally appropriate

1384
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
for me to break that rule in this slight way and get this

1385
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000
sheep out of this hole, then, well, Christ's judgment was

1386
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
well, then you're exactly on the right track. But if you're doing it

1387
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
carelessly and stupidly, you're breaking that rule. Then you're a

1388
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000
transgressor of the law and you're cursed. And I think that's

1389
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
exactly at the essence of what you're describing. It's like, you play

1390
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.000
by the rules. But then there's a meta rule, which is now and then

1391
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000
you break the rules. And you do that very, very carefully because

1392
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000
when you break the rules, you're breaking the rules. And the rules

1393
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000
are what keep peace. They're what keep peace in order. And so you

1394
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000
break them only in the service of a higher peace in order. And so

1395
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.000
that seems to be, and I think that's, you see this in, in, well,

1396
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
the sorts of stories that are influencing even the things that you're

1397
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000
writing, like in the Harry Potter series, for example, Harry's

1398
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:54.000
friends and compatriots are quite disciplined, hermione in

1399
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:58.000
particular because she's an absolute master of her craft. But they

1400
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
still break rules when it's necessary, only when it's necessary. And

1401
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000
that's what makes them more than the people who are just

1402
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
breaking rules all the time, the villains, so to speak. And

1403
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000
also makes them more than the people that are just being good

1404
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:17.000
by being conformist. So you need that touch of rebelliousness,

1405
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.000
but it's got to be a flavoring and not the whole diet.

1406
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.000
I've actually talked about that on this podcast before. There's

1407
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000
people in the military that they are like,

1408
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000
metal rule followers. These are people that have been following

1409
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000
rules of whole lives. And they've got perfect grades and they have

1410
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000
the team. They're all these things. And they're going to

1411
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000
make really good solid leaders, like they're going to be

1412
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:46.000
great leaders. But then there's this like one group above them.

1413
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Yeah, have that same thing, but they also have that little

1414
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000
bit of rebellion that they'll say, you know what, we're not

1415
01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000
going to win that. It doesn't make any sense. And that is

1416
01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.000
really an important factor to have. But you know,

1417
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
that's one of the reasons I like this guy, Colonel David Hacker,

1418
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.000
this guy was the ultimate rule follower for his whole

1419
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:11.000
career. At the end, in Vietnam, he did interview and said,

1420
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
if we keep fighting this way, we're not going to win this

1421
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:18.000
war. And they drove him out of the army. But that's the thing

1422
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
that because all along the way, there was other times where he

1423
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
do that. You know, his guy's going to get in take care of

1424
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
the guy. He'd break a rule and bring him beer or he'd do, you know,

1425
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000
he'd do that along the way, not not so far outside the

1426
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000
bonds that it would jeopardize his career. Because if he would do

1427
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
that, then you're not in charge of these guys anymore. Now,

1428
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.000
you're not going to have any impact. And so let's not get fired.

1429
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Right. Right. Let's not get stupidly fired. Right. That's not

1430
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000
an improvement. Exactly. Well, that's a,

1431
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:49.000
awesome. I guess we, I know you got to go. So I can't

1432
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000
think that we could get to a better little crust of the,

1433
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000
our little capstone of the conversation than right there.

1434
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Thanks for coming on again. Hey, my pleasure, man.

1435
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000
I'm glad we got a chance to talk about this book. This is a book

1436
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.000
that everybody should read. And, and you, I ordered the,

1437
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:10.000
well, I ordered a copy of yours with a Ford from Europe.

1438
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000
You can't buy it from Amazon here. You can't buy it from Amazon.

1439
01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
So it will be here when will it be? But I don't know.

1440
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
We're still negotiating the rights because the rights

1441
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
of the owners differ in North America. So that's the issue at the moment.

1442
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000
So okay. So I worked with an English publisher,

1443
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Penguin in the UK that, that put out the,

1444
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
I think it's vantage books. If I remember correctly,

1445
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000
I should just check and make sure that that's exactly right.

1446
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Harper perennial modern classics.

1447
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
That's not, that's not the British one.

1448
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Well, that's, so that's not the British one.

1449
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
The British one hasn't gotten to my house.

1450
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Yeah. And so yeah, it has to be ordered.

1451
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
It has to be ordered through Amazon UK. And we're,

1452
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000
we're working on a couple of things. Maybe to also maybe get the audio rights

1453
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
to the British version because I'd like to read it.

1454
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Nice. And that would be good. So the people could listen to it.

1455
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000
And so because it's, it's an absolutely necessary book.

1456
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Yeah. And it's written actually, what's,

1457
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
I like it because it's written very conversation.

1458
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
I mean, he's cracking jokes in there.

1459
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
He's making, it's a brilliant piece of literature as well as,

1460
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
I mean, it's a very readable book, although it's unbelievably harsh

1461
01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000
and, and demanding and, and draining to read,

1462
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000
but it's, it's brilliantly written. It's an unbelievably

1463
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:20.000
ingrossing read in the most horrible possible way.

1464
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000
But, and, and it is, is the case that it's written at this white

1465
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000
hot pace. You know, it's like talking to someone who's

1466
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.000
righteously, not self-righteously angry, but righteously angry

1467
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.000
for, for, for, for dozens of hours.

1468
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.000
And he just can't believe the levels of outrage that are,

1469
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:44.000
that are being, that are being so incredibly well expressed

1470
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.000
and so effectively expressed. And, and, and again, I, I think it's also

1471
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000
worth emphasizing the fact that, you know,

1472
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.000
social distance real contribution in many ways was to lay the

1473
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000
catastrophe at the feet of the doctrine and not to say no.

1474
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
This, this wasn't an aberration because of Stellanar,

1475
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000
you know, Lenin being the great leader and then Stellan being the monster

1476
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000
because Lenin was plenty monster himself.

1477
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.000
And Stellan was the logical conclusion to Lenin not, not an aberration.

1478
01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.000
But to say that, know, the horrors of what happened in the Soviet Union

1479
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000
were, were implicit in the collectivist system,

1480
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000
utopian system that gave rise to the philosophy to begin with,

1481
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
and that that's also an explanation why the same catastrophe

1482
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.000
is occurred wherever the Soviet system was applied everywhere else

1483
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
in the world. And something we really need to know.

1484
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
I mean, we fought a whole Cold War over that.

1485
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
We put damn near put the world to the torch because of this.

1486
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000
And the idea that these ideas are, the fact that these ideas are

1487
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
creeping back is really, it's unbearable as far as I'm concerned.

1488
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:51.000
So hopefully people read in this book and the, the re-release of this book

1489
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000
with your forward will prevent that from happening.

1490
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Well, at least it hopefully it will be a, a drop in a bucket that many other

1491
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
people can put drops into as well.

1492
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000
And so I'm hoping, I mean, I think the book has sold 15,000 copies

1493
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000
since the beginning of November, which is pretty good for the re-issue and old classic.

1494
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:15.000
But like it, it, it, it's required reading for an informed citizen of the 21st century.

1495
01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.000
It's not optional. You need to know this material.

1496
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:23.000
You're not, you're not, you don't understand your position in society

1497
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.000
as an individual or a citizen without knowing this material.

1498
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000
So it's like not knowing about what happened and not see Germany.

1499
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000
It's not acceptable to not know.

1500
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
So read the book.

1501
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Thanks for coming, Jordan.

1502
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Really good to see you again, man.

1503
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Absolutely.

1504
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Yeah, be better.

1505
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Appreciate it.

1506
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:48.000
And with that Jordan Peterson has departed the recording studio.

1507
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:57.000
And if you noticed that echo Charles was not present during the recording with Jordan Peterson,

1508
01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:05.000
but for the miracle of technology and recording echo has now joined us for the support.

1509
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000
You're a portion of this podcast.

1510
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
So good evening echo.

1511
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Good evening.

1512
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000
All right.

1513
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:21.000
So if people listen to this podcast, which we appreciate and you want to support this podcast and support yourself,

1514
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000
there are ways to do that echo can fill you in.

1515
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Sure.

1516
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000
So first way is wine.

1517
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:34.000
You're doing you just because we're all doing you just to yes, it might sound a little bit repetitive,

1518
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:40.000
but to me, when you do just going to be doing it every single day, everything a week,

1519
01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
at least even if you're doing the two times a week,

1520
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.000
three times I get it, either way you're going to need a ghee and a rash cart.

1521
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:50.000
So there is no question which kind of ghee you get.

1522
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.000
You get an origin ghee straight up made in America.

1523
01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:00.000
I watched one of their videos yesterday and it's kind of an older one too,

1524
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:10.000
but it made me like love origin even more because it's like you'll see you know the people that make up and all the ladies there and then pee like he has like longer hair and stuff like that.

1525
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.000
It's like oh man, this kind of more of the beginnings of origin, you know, anyway, I thought it was good.

1526
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.000
The last again made in America quality stuff for jujitsu.

1527
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:30.000
It's not like a blank ghee they get from over wherever some other place and then slap a embroidered patch on it.

1528
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Let's say that.

1529
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
No, this is made for jujitsu in America.

1530
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Yeah, everything made in America from where we grow the material is grown in America,

1531
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:45.000
woven in America, woven in Maine as a matter of fact, custom woven by origin.

1532
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.000
We weave it up there and make the best guise in the world.

1533
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Also got some other stuff for you know, you got t-shirts, you can get sweatshirts and also coming in 2019.

1534
01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Jeans.

1535
01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Yeah, jeans.

1536
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Denham origin denim.

1537
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000
I just call them jeans though.

1538
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Yeah, yeah, I dig it.

1539
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
That starts to like, I don't know, move towards a fashion thing.

1540
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
What if you take denim denim denim?

1541
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Well, I feel yeah, I dig it.

1542
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000
I don't feel that material.

1543
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Yeah, I feel like it's like origin denim they make it, you know.

1544
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Yeah, and then yeah, they make origin jeans for sure, but what if they make like a jean jacket?

1545
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Like a denim jacket?

1546
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
No, I bet you're, but it's still be a jean jacket.

1547
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000
That's true.

1548
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
I dig it.

1549
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Cool.

1550
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Either way, yeah, that's to, and I don't get excited for Jeans in general in life.

1551
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Oh, don't.

1552
01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Yeah, like, you know, you see it on TV.

1553
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000
I don't know.

1554
01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
JCPenny has a sale.

1555
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
You know, black thread or whatever.

1556
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
And you know, some jeans, I don't get excited.

1557
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:48.000
You probably, I'm assuming you don't either, maybe you do, I don't know, but when Pete posts

1558
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:54.000
little like videos of the close, you know, close up of the buttons, the jeans.

1559
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Come on, Brown.

1560
01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000
That's, that's kind of exciting.

1561
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
I'm just saying either way.

1562
01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Yeah.

1563
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Either way, the, also we have supplements too.

1564
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Affirmative.

1565
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Origin labs, which is expanding.

1566
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Yes.

1567
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Yeah, yeah, we bought another building up there.

1568
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Yeah.

1569
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000
But yeah, so they're making, we are making supplements.

1570
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Joint warfare, cruel oil, super cruel oil.

1571
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.000
By the way, discipline.

1572
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000
The try.

1573
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Fecta.

1574
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Yeah.

1575
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Yeah.

1576
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000
My wife went on a trip.

1577
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Didn't take joint warfare with her.

1578
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Yeah.

1579
01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
She's there for three, four days.

1580
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Her knee starts bothering her.

1581
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.000
It bothers her the rest of the trip.

1582
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000
She comes home.

1583
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
She goes back on joint warfare for three, four days.

1584
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Knees fine again.

1585
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Yeah.

1586
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Same thing.

1587
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000
That's just, that's just crazy.

1588
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
That's just a reality of it.

1589
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
So joint warfare, good for your joints, cruel oil.

1590
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Also, good for your joints and good for your, good for your whole life system.

1591
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Is that a thing?

1592
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Life system?

1593
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Life.

1594
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Yes.

1595
01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Okay.

1596
01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Well, it's good for that too.

1597
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Discipline.

1598
01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:04.000
When you need that focus and also discipline go, which is my pre cognitive enhancement tool.

1599
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Go to.

1600
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Go to.

1601
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Yeah.

1602
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Yeah.

1603
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Yeah.

1604
01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
It's funny.

1605
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Yeah.

1606
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
True.

1607
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:19.000
By the way, in Hawaii, which is the reason why I didn't appear on this episode of the podcast.

1608
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
In Hawaii, so my father-in-law came.

1609
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000
I told him the story about how he always talk about cruel oil.

1610
01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000
He's just sort of looking at me like whatever.

1611
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.000
And, you know, he used to tell me, oh yeah, cruel oil is good.

1612
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Good for you all this stuff.

1613
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000
And he said, not listen because, you know, he's more like a health dude.

1614
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Yeah.

1615
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000
And then when you started talking about it, like literally the day,

1616
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000
you start talking about it, start taking it.

1617
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
And he was like, he didn't care.

1618
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:48.000
It kind of went right over his head and he was like, oh, so did you feel the difference?

1619
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
You know, like that's what he was concerned about.

1620
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000
What do you mean care?

1621
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000
That sounds like a respect.

1622
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Also on top of that is Yam Mok, which is, which is Mok basically.

1623
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000
That's what it is.

1624
01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.000
It's, uh, it has protein in it.

1625
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000
You mix it with milk.

1626
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
I got to make that statement.

1627
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000
If you mix it with oil, you can mix it with almond milk.

1628
01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000
You can mix it with coconut milk.

1629
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
You can mix it with regular cow milk.

1630
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Sure.

1631
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:18.000
If you mix it with water, it's not, I'm not jumping up and down about it.

1632
01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Yeah.

1633
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000
And tell me, it's the most delicious thing in the world.

1634
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:25.000
If you mix it with milk, whole milk, especially, I will tell you, it's, it's a, it's a dessert.

1635
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Straight up.

1636
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
It's a dessert that you will make you stronger.

1637
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.000
If so, you know, like hot cocoa, you ever make hot.

1638
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Oh yeah.

1639
01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Okay.

1640
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000
So I'm a fan.

1641
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Put in water, right?

1642
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Would you put in water and milk?

1643
01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000
That is not hot cocoa to me.

1644
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Okay.

1645
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.000
I know we're talking about, you get the little, the little packet that you're supposed to mix with

1646
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000
water.

1647
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000
It's got the little crappy marshmallows in it.

1648
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Yeah, that's not, that's a non-starter for me.

1649
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Yeah.

1650
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000
So that's kind of the point there.

1651
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Yeah.

1652
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
It's sort of, you know, along the same lines.

1653
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Yeah.

1654
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000
It's cool.

1655
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Yeah.

1656
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.000
It's cool.

1657
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000
It's good.

1658
01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
You can do it.

1659
01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Yep.

1660
01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:02.000
And there's probably many, many, many people who do that.

1661
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
You know, that's my opinion.

1662
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.000
And by the way, you can't have hot chocolate milk.

1663
01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Yeah.

1664
01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.000
It's good.

1665
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
It's right up there.

1666
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Especially the word, kid one.

1667
01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Yeah.

1668
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.000
So you got Mint chocolate, peanut butter chocolate, vanilla gorilla, and the darkness.

1669
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.000
And then there's the, the warrior kid milk, which has a little bit less protein in it.

1670
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Unless you double up on your scoops.

1671
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Like I do for the strawberry because the strawberry is ridiculously good.

1672
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:35.000
So give that a shot and by the way, all these things are available at originmain.com.

1673
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.000
And that's, that's the state of Maine.

1674
01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Yeah.

1675
01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Yeah.

1676
01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Not just Maine.

1677
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Like the Maine spot.

1678
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
You know, it is a Maine spot, but check.

1679
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Cool.

1680
01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Yeah.

1681
01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Also, if you want to represent, you know, get a discipline equals freedom, shirt, or a rash guard, you know, get after it.

1682
01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Anyway, you want to represent the pat.

1683
01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Go to joccostore.com.

1684
01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
That's where you can get all this stuff.

1685
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Hoodies.

1686
01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
You know, hey, Christmas is coming up.

1687
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.000
It's facing.

1688
01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
There's no avoiding it.

1689
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000
It's coming up.

1690
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
You know, so you want to grab something.

1691
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
That's a good place to grab something.

1692
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Some new stuff on there too.

1693
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:17.000
But yeah, if you want to represent while on the pat, joccostore.com.

1694
01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Good spot.

1695
01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Also, joccoweight.

1696
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:26.000
So these claims of dead lifting 8,000 pounds.

1697
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000
I haven't dead lifted in a while.

1698
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
So it was like, you know what, I'm going to test it.

1699
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000
It can's right.

1700
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Tied, drink it straight up dead.

1701
01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Dead lifted 8,000 pounds.

1702
01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Just like that.

1703
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Just like that.

1704
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000
No warm up even.

1705
01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.000
No, you don't need it.

1706
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000
You know, it's real.

1707
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
The warm up is drinking some joccoweight.

1708
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Yeah.

1709
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.000
That is the warm up.

1710
01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.000
And you're good.

1711
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.000
8,000 pound deadlift.

1712
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Yeah, that's the only product in the world.

1713
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:54.000
In any capacity that guarantees 100% 8,000 pound deadlift minimum.

1714
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Yeah.

1715
01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.000
100%.

1716
01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:00.000
But yeah, so yeah, you get them one in the dry tea bags.

1717
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
If that's your thing, when you see.

1718
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000
See.

1719
01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000
That's the word right?

1720
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1721
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Steep.

1722
01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Steep.

1723
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Okay.

1724
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Boom.

1725
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.000
If you like that gig.

1726
01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Hot, cold, whatever.

1727
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.000
And then the cans, which I recommend.

1728
01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.000
I recommend the cans.

1729
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Actually, I don't know if I'd recommend it, but I prefer the cans.

1730
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000
I like them both.

1731
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Yeah.

1732
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Depending on the scenario.

1733
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000
There you go.

1734

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Yeah.

1741
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
And listen to a bunch of them.

1742
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Yeah.

1743
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000
And one of them that you can also listen to.

1744
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:41.000
In addition to this one, if you want, you can check out the Warrior Kid podcast.

1745
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
That's basically directed at kids.

1746
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:49.000
But I'll tell you that Uncle Jake has lessons for everyone in the podcast.

1747
01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
And also, we got the YouTube channel.

1748
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.000
The YouTube channel where you can watch this podcast in its full length.

1749
01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:59.000
And you can see what people look like if you don't know what Jordan B. Peterson looks like.

1750
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000
If you don't know what echo Charles looks like or if you don't know what I look like,

1751
01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.000
you can watch the YouTube channel.

1752
01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
And you can see all of us.

1753
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:16.000
If you've never seen Echo before, but you've only heard him, he probably doesn't look like what you think he looks like.

1754
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Yeah.

1755
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000
And I don't know if that's good or bad.

1756
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
I don't know if that's a backhanded compliment or a backhanded.

1757
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Like the Roger to where he's statement about you, about your voice.

1758
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Probably both, yeah.

1759
01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.000
A little bit of both.

1760
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Yeah.

1761
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:32.000
But we'll suffice it to say that he's not what you expect when you see him in reality.

1762
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:39.000
And he also makes videos that are enhanced by imagery and music.

1763
01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Yeah.

1764
01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Exactly.

1765
01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
And those are on there too.

1766
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
So you can check those out.

1767
01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000
You can subscribe to that YouTube channel.

1768
01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Also, we got the psychological warfare album.

1769
01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.000
And that has tracks on it of.

1770
01:46:52.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Well, there are of me telling you pragmatically why you should or should not do something like skip or work out.

1771
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
You should not skip or work out.

1772
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Eat donuts.

1773
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
You should not eat donuts.

1774
01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000
So just some little things like that.

1775
01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
You can check that out psychological warfare.

1776
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Echo claims that it has 100% effectiveness.

1777
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Yeah.

1778
01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000
100%.

1779
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Should you go to the gym?

1780
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Yes, you should.

1781
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
And if you listen to the track, you will go to the gym.

1782
01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Yeah.

1783
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.000
100% effectiveness.

1784
01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.000
And actually, I mean, a lot of claims being made about effectiveness on this scenario.

1785
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Well, man, hey, if it's real, it's real.

1786
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.000
You know, this double blind placebo tested.

1787
01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Well, you know, single blind maybe.

1788
01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Okay.

1789
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000
I don't know what that means.

1790
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000
But it's a sound official.

1791
01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:41.000
And it is official when, okay, and I kind of act right to psychologically analyze psychological warfare.

1792
01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Like why does it work every single time?

1793
01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000
And here's part of it.

1794
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Even you, you know how like when you get hypnotized,

1795
01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
I'm not saying you're, we should have, I should have asked, I should have asked you

1796
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.000
order this question.

1797
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Yeah.

1798
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000
And to agree with this, I think.

1799
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Okay.

1800
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Well, maybe next time we're going to ask.

1801
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Echo's bro theory on this.

1802
01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:02.000
So, you know, like, um, being hypnotized, for example.

1803
01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Yeah.

1804
01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.000
You've never been hypnotized.

1805
01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Yeah, I mean, either.

1806
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000
So, but then again, it looks real when something happens to someone.

1807
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
You've never said, volunteered to not be hypnotized.

1808
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Okay, me neither.

1809
01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Same thing.

1810
01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:16.000
So hypnotism from what I understand is you have to like be, what he call

1811
01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.000
a hypnotist.

1812
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000
So, just open to it.

1813
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Yeah.

1814
01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Open to it.

1815
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Yeah.

1816
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.000
So if you're a, um,

1817
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.000
suggestible person, that's like you have a certain kind of mind.

1818
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000
And then on top of that, even more consciously, you have to

1819
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
volunteer to be hypnotized.

1820
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Okay.

1821
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000
I mean, I'm sure there's methods that you can sort of hypnotize someone

1822
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.000
without them knowing anything.

1823
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
But usually, I should even say I'm sure.

1824
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.000
But.

1825
01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Oh, yeah.

1826
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000
It's like I'm the word for it.

1827
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:44.000
I wouldn't be surprised if you can hypnotize someone and then

1828
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.000
or not.

1829
01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Nonetheless, usually the hypnotic sequence goes through, hey, you volunteer.

1830
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Like conscious, yeah, sure, I'll be hypnotizing you sit there and you're

1831
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000
come to ten and you're closing your eyes and breathing.

1832
01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Anyway, so you consciously volunteer to be hypnotized.

1833
01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000
So you're open to being hypnotized and then blah, blah, blah.

1834
01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:06.000
So psychological warfare is like, hey, you recognize, okay, I have this

1835
01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.000
weakness.

1836
01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:08.000
I'm about to skip this workout right now.

1837
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
You're basically saying, hey, I need to help.

1838
01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
I need, you know, I need a little spot.

1839
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000
You're volunteering for help.

1840
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.000
I'm volunteering.

1841
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Yeah, it's not like I'm like sitting in my room.

1842
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000
It's not completely against your will.

1843
01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Exactly right.

1844
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.000
You're not just bustin' in the door, you know, insane.

1845
01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Hey, don't skip the workout.

1846
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Meanwhile, in your mind, you already committed to skipping the

1847
01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000
way.

1848
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000
It's different.

1849
01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
You're like, you're not committed to skipping the workout.

1850
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.000
You just like are running the risk of skipping the work.

1851
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000
You know, that weakness just creeps in and you're like, hey, I see you

1852
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.000
weakness.

1853
01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000
You're creeping in right now.

1854
01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000
I'm going to get, I'm basically, I'm going to tell Jockel that you're in here.

1855
01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000
And he's going to, you know, make you leave.

1856
01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000
And you play the track or whatever you have it on your phone, right?

1857
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Because you have all your playlists on your phone.

1858
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Anyway, you just play this psychological work for everyone.

1859
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.000
And you won't skip the workout, seem to say, because you don't want to skip the

1860
01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000
workout.

1861
01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000
No one wants to skip the workout.

1862
01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
No one's thinking tomorrow.

1863
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
I can't wait to skip this workout.

1864
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
No, it's not like that, you know.

1865
01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.000
So it's, you come in and you just give that little nudge.

1866
01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.000
That's why it works so good.

1867
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000
It's true.

1868
01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.000
It's absolutely true.

1869
01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000
I like it.

1870
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.000
And then the last psychological warfare, it's very effective.

1871
01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000
100%.

1872
01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Also, while you're working out and if you're bored with your squats, the bench, get some kettle

1873
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.000
bells from on it in my opinion.

1874
01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000
On it.com slash jockel.

1875
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Good stuff on there.

1876
01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Jump rope, battle ropes, kettle bells, clubs.

1877
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Be careful with the clubs.

1878
01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
I was watching a video of a guy doing this club routine.

1879
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
I was like, dang, he took a lot of coordination.

1880
01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Like I'm looking at it and he had like the 40.

1881
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000
I think like I did.

1882
01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.000
I can't even imagine trying to do anything coordinated with the 40.

1883
01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Yes.

1884
01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Because I only have the 20.

1885
01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Yeah.

1886
01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.000
And yeah, they come off real a lot more heavy than they look.

1887
01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Oh yeah, when you grab them at the end of the day, if it's 20 pounds, it's 20 pounds.

1888
01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:04.000
No.

1889
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
There's no getting past that physically.

1890
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:11.000
But when you pick it up, it's like, it's like, when you pick up your friend,

1891
01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:15.000
you know, or your kid freaking in the way 70 pounds.

1892
01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.000
It's like, I pick up 70 pounds with one hand.

1893
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
It's no problem when it's a dumbbell.

1894
01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Should I pick up your kid when there's 70 pounds with one hand?

1895
01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Can't do it.

1896
01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000
It's hard.

1897
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Unless that's how these clubs are anyway.

1898
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.000
So watch out for those anyway.

1899
01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Go to onit.com slash jockel.

1900
01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
You can get some really cool stuff on there.

1901
01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Really cool.

1902
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Awesome.

1903
01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
I got some books as well.

1904
01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
First off, Mike in the dragons.

1905
01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
I know Jordan and I talked about it a little bit today.

1906
01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.000
And it was actually sold out for a little bit.

1907
01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:46.000
It is now back in stock and have many, many, many,

1908
01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:51.000
thousands and thousands of copies that are inbound that are being printed.

1909
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
So if you want Mike in the dragons,

1910
01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000
go to Amazon in order.

1911
01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000
There's a little video on there.

1912
01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
If you want to know what it's about that echo put together.

1913
01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000
It's a solid video from what I understand.

1914
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
The kids like to watch the video.

1915
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:07.000
It's like a little mini short.

1916
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000
It's super fast.

1917
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
It's two minutes.

1918
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Even in even my kids.

1919
01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.000
So we're on, on, I watched the video.

1920
01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Yeah.

1921
01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.000
If you are sending to me, I watched it like 14 times.

1922
01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Yeah.

1923
01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Because there's a lot of elements in it.

1924
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000
A lot of things going on.

1925
01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Yeah.

1926
01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.000
To my son.

1927
01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
It's like a micro cartoon kind of.

1928
01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
No, it's like a micro movie.

1929
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Yeah.

1930
01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Well, it's a cartoon because there's a illustration.

1931
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Yeah.

1932
01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.000
But yeah, it's fun.

1933
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
We put on the TV when I was in Hawaii.

1934
01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
You know, yeah, smart TV and there you can put YouTube on there.

1935
01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Oh, he's put on there.

1936
01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.000
I put on the TV and my kids are all jumping up at that mic in the dragon's mouth.

1937
01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000
It's, you know, it's two minutes long.

1938
01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Yeah.

1939
01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.000
No, I, you know, Jordan and I were talking about it.

1940
01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:50.000
And, you know, obviously it's about facing your dragons.

1941
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
And there's obviously a metaphor there.

1942
01:52:52.000 --> 01:53:00.000
And it's a real true pragmatic, simple to understand lessons of how to stand up and confront the

1943
01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:06.000
world and confront your fears that little kids will clearly and easily understand.

1944
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
And it'll even impact on anybody that reads it.

1945
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
So, Mike in the dragons, you can get that book.

1946
01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:22.000
On top of that, if you got kids, you can also get them the way of the warrior kid, which is another book about a young kid who's going through the problems that normal kids have.

1947
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:28.000
And luckily, Uncle Jake, who was a seal in the seal team, shows up for the summer and helps them overcome those problems.

1948
01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.000
And then that series carries on another book called Mark's Mission.

1949
01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:38.000
You can pick those two books up and give me that whatever kids you, those, those books, when you read those books,

1950
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000
you'll wish you had that book when you were a kid.

1951
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:44.000
I know I absolutely wish I had that book when I was a kid.

1952
01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.000
And I wish I had that book when my kids were kids.

1953
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Yeah.

1954
01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Because it teaches them what it is they need to know, period.

1955
01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000
That's it.

1956
01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.000
The discipline goes for you to feel manual.

1957
01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
That book.

1958
01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:01.000
That's how you do that's how you, it's just a field manual of how to be on the path of discipline.

1959
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000
That's what it is.

1960
01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Look, the path of discipline is not easy.

1961
01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
And there's no field manual for it.

1962
01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Oh, wait, there is now.

1963
01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000
But there didn't used to be.

1964
01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000
There didn't used to be.

1965
01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Look, I know discipline will help me.

1966
01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
How do I get discipline?

1967
01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Where does discipline come from?

1968
01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.000
None of that information was assembled anywhere.

1969
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
I made a field manual for it.

1970
01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000
It's called the discipline equals freedom.

1971
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Field manual.

1972
01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:25.000
It's not, it's not like any other book you can do.

1973
01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:29.000
We other book you've ever seen or read period.

1974
01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000
It's not.

1975
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
But it's very popular.

1976
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000
It's great.

1977
01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000
If you want, there's another thing.

1978
01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Kris, this one is a Christmas.

1979
01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.000
This is a Christmas scenario.

1980
01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000
This is a Christmas scenario.

1981
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Give this book to somebody that needs help or needs to stay on the path or get on the path.

1982
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.000
This book will be extremely beneficial to them or people that are on the path.

1983
01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Getting after it.

1984
01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000
This won't keep them there.

1985
01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
So that's the field manual.

1986
01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.24
If you want the audio version that it is not unautable,

1987
01:54:55.24 --> 01:54:59.44
it's on iTunes and Amazon, Music and Google Play as an MP3.

1988
01:54:59.44 --> 01:55:01.28
Also, the first book I wrote with my brother,

1989
01:55:01.28 --> 01:55:03.12
Lave Babin, it's called Extreme Ownership,

1990
01:55:03.12 --> 01:55:06.32
but that is a book taking the leadership lessons

1991
01:55:06.32 --> 01:55:07.88
that we learned on the battlefield

1992
01:55:07.88 --> 01:55:11.000
and translating them to your business and to your life.

1993
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.28
And then the follow-up to that book

1994
01:55:13.28 --> 01:55:15.08
is the dichotomy of leadership,

1995
01:55:15.08 --> 01:55:18.36
which takes those lessons that we learned in combat

1996
01:55:18.36 --> 01:55:23.36
and goes granular in teaching you how to balance

1997
01:55:23.36 --> 01:55:26.72
the various dichotomies that you experience as a leader.

1998
01:55:26.72 --> 01:55:29.68
So both, and all those books are available

1999
01:55:29.68 --> 01:55:32.44
on Amazon or wherever else you might divide books.

2000
01:55:32.44 --> 01:55:33.48
Also, we got Ashlan Front,

2001
01:55:33.48 --> 01:55:36.28
which is my leadership consultancy.

2002
01:55:37.24 --> 01:55:38.76
We solve problems through leadership.

2003
01:55:38.76 --> 01:55:39.60
That's what we do.

2004
01:55:39.60 --> 01:55:42.000
We work with companies all over the country

2005
01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.40
and internationally, if you want us to come

2006
01:55:45.40 --> 01:55:50.04
and align the leadership at your company for victory,

2007
01:55:50.04 --> 01:55:51.92
then go to Ashlan Front.com.

2008
01:55:53.16 --> 01:55:57.32
We are doing, we have a leadership conference called The Muster.

2009
01:55:57.32 --> 01:55:59.72
And we've done six monsters.

2010
01:55:59.72 --> 01:56:02.64
We are doing three in 2019.

2011
01:56:02.64 --> 01:56:04.40
We're doing one in Chicago in the spring.

2012
01:56:04.40 --> 01:56:07.56
We're doing one in Denver in the fall

2013
01:56:07.56 --> 01:56:11.52
and we're doing Sydney, Australia, in December.

2014
01:56:11.52 --> 01:56:14.52
So if you want to come to one of those events,

2015
01:56:14.52 --> 01:56:16.88
all the events that we've done have sold out,

2016
01:56:16.88 --> 01:56:17.72
all of them.

2017
01:56:17.72 --> 01:56:20.84
These are all absolutely going to sell out.

2018
01:56:20.84 --> 01:56:23.84
So if you want to come, go to extremownership.com

2019
01:56:23.84 --> 01:56:27.04
and register and as quick as you can.

2020
01:56:27.04 --> 01:56:29.28
And then lastly, we have EF Overwatch.

2021
01:56:29.28 --> 01:56:32.88
We are connecting special operations, veterans,

2022
01:56:32.88 --> 01:56:37.88
and combat aviation veterans that are looking for work,

2023
01:56:39.44 --> 01:56:42.000
that are proven leaders that are experienced leaders

2024
01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.60
and we're connecting them with companies out there

2025
01:56:43.60 --> 01:56:46.48
in the civilian sector that need leaders.

2026
01:56:46.48 --> 01:56:49.88
So if you want to comment that from either side,

2027
01:56:49.88 --> 01:56:52.56
whether you're a vet or whether you're a company,

2028
01:56:52.56 --> 01:56:56.84
go to EF Overwatch.com to get in the game.

2029
01:56:56.84 --> 01:56:59.56
And if you have any more questions for us

2030
01:56:59.56 --> 01:57:03.56
or answers for us, we are available on the interwebs

2031
01:57:04.76 --> 01:57:09.76
on Twitter and on Instagram and on the Facebook.

2032
01:57:09.76 --> 01:57:14.76
This book, Echoes, Adequatrals and I am at Jocca Willink

2033
01:57:14.76 --> 01:57:19.76
and I started out this podcast today.

2034
01:57:19.76 --> 01:57:22.64
Pretty heavy, pretty rough.

2035
01:57:22.64 --> 01:57:26.08
And I think it's important to remember something

2036
01:57:26.08 --> 01:57:28.76
that I always refer back to and that is that Eval does

2037
01:57:28.76 --> 01:57:30.80
exist in the world.

2038
01:57:30.80 --> 01:57:32.56
It's out there.

2039
01:57:32.56 --> 01:57:36.36
And with that, I'd like to thank all the military personnel

2040
01:57:36.36 --> 01:57:40.16
throughout the globe that stand up to Eval

2041
01:57:40.16 --> 01:57:42.44
in the world and thanks to police

2042
01:57:42.44 --> 01:57:44.80
and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics

2043
01:57:44.80 --> 01:57:47.52
and EMTs and correctional officers and border patrol

2044
01:57:47.52 --> 01:57:50.40
and all the first responders that stand up

2045
01:57:50.40 --> 01:57:53.16
and face Eval here at home

2046
01:57:54.36 --> 01:57:56.44
and to everyone else out there.

2047
01:57:59.16 --> 01:58:02.84
If things are tough and I know they get tough,

2048
01:58:02.84 --> 01:58:07.84
life is hard, but there's still reason to be thankful.

2049
01:58:09.72 --> 01:58:11.88
Be thankful you're not in a good log.

2050
01:58:13.56 --> 01:58:15.76
Be thankful that you're not being tortured,

2051
01:58:15.76 --> 01:58:17.60
be thankful that you have food to eat,

2052
01:58:17.60 --> 01:58:20.16
be thankful you have a bed to sleep on.

2053
01:58:21.84 --> 01:58:25.64
And then do your best to watch out for those

2054
01:58:25.64 --> 01:58:30.24
little seeds of Eval that are planted around you

2055
01:58:30.24 --> 01:58:35.24
and planted in you and keep those seeds of Eval in check

2056
01:58:39.84 --> 01:58:44.08
by going out into the world and doing good.

2057
01:58:44.08 --> 01:59:01.68
And until next time, this is echo and jocco out.
