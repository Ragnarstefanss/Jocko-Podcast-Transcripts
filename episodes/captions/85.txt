[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 85.
[00:00:04] With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:07] Good evening, echo.
[00:00:09] Good evening.
[00:00:13] I was given a very old man who could not or would not keep up with his countrymen
[00:00:20] because he repeatedly fell and then simply lay there.
[00:00:25] I regularly had to lift him up and drag him forward.
[00:00:30] Thus I only reached the execution site when my comrades had already shot their Jews.
[00:00:38] At the site of his countrymen who had been shot, my Jew threw himself on the ground and remained
[00:00:43] lying there.
[00:00:45] I then cocked my carbine and shot him through the back of the head.
[00:00:51] As I was already very upset from the cruel treatment of the Jews during the clearing of
[00:00:56] the town and was completely in turmoil, I shot too high.
[00:01:03] The entire back of the skull of my Jew was torn off and the brain exposed.
[00:01:11] Parts of the skull flew into sergeant Steinmeetz's face.
[00:01:18] This was grounds for me after returning to the truck to go to the first sergeant and ask
[00:01:24] for my release.
[00:01:27] I had become so sick that I simply couldn't anymore.
[00:01:33] I was then relieved by the first sergeant.
[00:01:45] Systematic murder.
[00:01:52] That's what we're talking about.
[00:01:54] This is the Nazi's final solution which was not always carried out in the relatively
[00:02:05] detached method often thought of when we think of the Holocaust.
[00:02:12] Because when we think of the Holocaust, a lot of times we think of this big mechanism.
[00:02:17] We think of trains.
[00:02:19] We think of gas chambers.
[00:02:21] We think of process.
[00:02:23] We think of a massive bureaucratic machine that is doing the killing.
[00:02:33] And maybe that in some way is easier for us to understand.
[00:02:38] And that's why we focus on that piece.
[00:02:44] It's easier for us to accept that.
[00:02:45] But it wasn't all like that.
[00:02:51] Many lives were taken.
[00:02:54] Many murders committed by hand.
[00:03:01] That close range point blank.
[00:03:11] So what kind of monsters committed those atrocities, those personal atrocities, up close
[00:03:28] and personal murders that covered the murderers in the blood of their victims?
[00:03:41] What?
[00:03:42] What kind of men were those?
[00:03:48] And how did they end up there?
[00:03:55] And what can we do to prevent it from occurring again?
[00:04:12] Now to answer or at least try and come to some understanding, we're going to explore
[00:04:20] a book that is called Ordinary Men.
[00:04:25] Reserve police battalion 101 and the final solution in Poland written by Christopher
[00:04:34] R. Browning.
[00:04:36] And that first excerpt that I read is from that book.
[00:04:42] And it's from a soldier in the police battalion named August Zorn.
[00:04:49] That's actually a pseudonym the name for changed for some of the Nazis in the book.
[00:04:57] But the book is incredibly detailed in what happened and where these men were from and
[00:05:09] what unfolded.
[00:05:13] And obviously this is going to be a graphic episode.
[00:05:21] And I actually wish I didn't have to talk about this.
[00:05:28] I really do.
[00:05:29] I wish I could talk about nicer things.
[00:05:35] I wish I could talk about pleasant things and we could just forget about all this horror.
[00:05:41] But I, there's the rub because even though it would be easier and more pleasant to talk
[00:05:55] about something nice, the problem is that if we forget about these things, then we forget
[00:06:00] about these things.
[00:06:06] And if we forget, we don't learn.
[00:06:11] If we don't learn about what humans can do and why they do what they do, then we can repeat
[00:06:21] our mistakes and that is awful.
[00:06:28] So we go because we have to go.
[00:06:37] We go back to the book.
[00:06:48] Just as the sky was beginning to lighten, the convoy halted outside Yosafov.
[00:06:57] It was a typical Polish village of modest white houses with that straw roofs.
[00:07:04] Among it's inhabitants were 1800 Jews.
[00:07:09] The village was totally quiet.
[00:07:11] The men of reserve police battalion 101 climbed down from their trucks and assembled in
[00:07:16] a half circle around their commander, Major Vill Helm Trapp.
[00:07:21] A 53-year-old career policeman affectionately known by his men as Papa Trapp.
[00:07:29] The time had come for Trapp to address the men and inform them of the assignment the battalion
[00:07:33] had received.
[00:07:36] Pale and nervous with choking voice and tears in his eyes.
[00:07:43] Trapp visibly fought to control himself as he spoke.
[00:07:49] The battalion, he said, plaintively, had to perform a frightfully unpleasant task.
[00:07:56] This assignment was not to his liking.
[00:07:58] Indeed it was highly regrettable, but the orders came from the highest authorities.
[00:08:04] If it would make the task any easier, the men should remember that in Germany, the bombs
[00:08:09] were falling on women and children.
[00:08:13] Then he turned to the matter at hand.
[00:08:15] The Jews had instigated the American boycott that had damaged Germany.
[00:08:20] One policeman remembered Trapp saying.
[00:08:24] There were Jews in the village of Yosafov who were involved with the partisans he explained
[00:08:31] according to two others.
[00:08:33] The battalion had now been ordered to round up these Jews.
[00:08:38] The male Jews of working age were to be separated and taken to a work camp, the remaining
[00:08:43] Jews.
[00:08:45] The women, children, and elderly were to be shot on the spot by the battalion.
[00:08:54] Having explained what awaited his men, Trapp made them an extraordinary offer.
[00:09:00] If any of the older men among them did not feel up to the task that lay before them, he could
[00:09:06] step out.
[00:09:14] Trapp paused.
[00:09:17] And after some moments, one man from third company, Otto Julius Schimcki, stepped forward.
[00:09:27] Captain Hoffman, who had arrived in Yosafov directly from Zakarov with third platoon
[00:09:33] of third company, and had not been part of the officer's meetings that day before was furious
[00:09:39] that one of his men had been the first to break ranks.
[00:09:44] And began to berate Schimcki.
[00:09:48] But Trapp caught him off.
[00:09:50] After he had taken Schimcki under his protection, some 10 or 12 other men stepped forward
[00:09:55] as well.
[00:09:57] They turned in their rifles and were told to await a further assignment from the major.
[00:10:06] So we'll go into this, but you've got a battalion.
[00:10:13] We companies, there's probably 500 men.
[00:10:18] And we have they get this savage order that they're going to go and shoot.
[00:10:26] The women, children, and elderly on the spot in this village with pretty white houses.
[00:10:33] And the commander, this guy Trapp, who obviously isn't comfortable with it, he's got tears
[00:10:39] in his eyes when he's giving this order.
[00:10:42] He says, hey, if anybody doesn't want to participate, you can step forward now.
[00:10:45] And like 10 or 12 people out of 500 step forward.
[00:10:50] The rest of them hold the line in this case.
[00:10:55] Going back to the book, Trapp then summoned the company commanders and gave them the respective
[00:10:59] assignments.
[00:11:00] The orders were relayed by the platoon commanders.
[00:11:05] Tupel tunes of third company were to surround the village.
[00:11:08] The men were explicitly ordered to shoot anyone trying to escape.
[00:11:12] The remaining men were to round up the Jews and take them to the marketplace.
[00:11:16] Those two sick are frail to walk to the marketplace as well as infants.
[00:11:21] And anyone offering resistance or attempting to hide were to be shot on the spot.
[00:11:28] Thereafter, a few men of the first company were escorted.
[00:11:31] Were to escort the work Jews who had been selected at the marketplace while the rest of
[00:11:37] the first company was to proceed to the forest to form firing squads.
[00:11:43] The Jews were to be loaded onto battalion trucks by second company and third platoon of
[00:11:47] third company and shuddled from the marketplace to the forest.
[00:11:52] And that's for executions.
[00:11:56] After making the assignments, Trapp spent most of the day in town, either in a school
[00:12:02] room, converted into his headquarters at the homes of the Polish mayor.
[00:12:06] At the local priest at the marketplace or on the road to the forest.
[00:12:12] But he did not go to the forest itself or witnessed the executions.
[00:12:17] His absence there was conspicuous as one policeman bitterly commented, Major Trapp was never there.
[00:12:25] Instead he remained in Yosofof because he allegedly could not bear the sight.
[00:12:32] He men were upset about that and said we couldn't bear it either.
[00:12:39] Indeed Trapp's distress was a secret to no one.
[00:12:43] At the marketplace one policeman remembered hearing Trapp say, oh God, why did I have to
[00:12:48] be given these orders as he put his hand on his heart?
[00:12:53] Another policeman witnessed him at the schoolhouse.
[00:12:55] Today I can see exactly before my eyes, Major Trapp and the room pacing back and forth
[00:13:00] with his hands behind his back. He made a downcast impression and spoke to me.
[00:13:04] He said something like, man, such jobs don't suit me.
[00:13:09] But orders are orders.
[00:13:12] Another man remembered vividly how Trapp finally alone in our room sat on a stool and
[00:13:18] wept bitterly.
[00:13:20] The tears really flowed.
[00:13:22] Can you hear that? That idea that orders are orders.
[00:13:31] Doesn't stand. Doesn't work.
[00:13:36] Back to the book as the roundup, neared completion.
[00:13:39] The men of first company were withdrawn from the search and given a quick lesson in the
[00:13:43] gruesome task that awaited them.
[00:13:46] They were instructed by the battalion doctor and the company's first sergeant.
[00:13:51] And this is a quote from one of the men.
[00:13:53] I believe that at this point all the officers of the battalion were present, especially
[00:13:57] our battalion physician, Dr. Schoenfelder.
[00:14:02] He now had to explain to us precisely how we had to shoot in order to induce the immediate
[00:14:06] death of the victim.
[00:14:09] I remember exactly that for this demonstration, he drew or outlined the contour of a human
[00:14:14] body, at least from the shoulders upward, and then indicated precisely the point on which
[00:14:19] the fixed bayonet was to be placed as an aiming guide.
[00:14:26] So we have the battalion doctor who's instructing some of the men and you're going to see
[00:14:33] that it wasn't all of them to take the bayonet, which is on their rifle, put it on the back
[00:14:39] of the neck as an aiming guide to know where exactly where to shoot.
[00:14:51] Back to the book.
[00:14:52] First sergeant camera had taken the initial contingent of shooters in first company to
[00:14:56] affordest several kilometers from Yosafov.
[00:15:01] The truck's halted on a dirt road that ran along the edge at a point where a pathway
[00:15:06] led into the woods.
[00:15:08] The men climbed down from their trucks and waited.
[00:15:13] When the first truck load of 35 to 40 Jews arrived and equal number of policemen came
[00:15:18] forward and faced a face were paired off with their victims.
[00:15:24] Led by camera, the policemen and Jews marched down the forest path.
[00:15:30] They turned off into the woods at a point indicated by Captain Wolff, who busied himself
[00:15:36] throughout the day selecting the execution sites.
[00:15:41] Camera then ordered the Jews to lie down in a row.
[00:15:45] The policemen stepped up behind them, placed their bayonets on the backbone above the shoulder
[00:15:50] blade as instructed earlier and on cameras command fired in unison.
[00:16:01] In the meantime, more policemen of first company had arrived at the edge of the forest
[00:16:05] to fill out a second firing squad.
[00:16:07] As the first firing squad marched out of the woods to the unloading point, the second
[00:16:11] group took their victims along the same path into the woods.
[00:16:16] Wolff chose a site of fire on so the next batch of victims would not see the corpses
[00:16:22] from the earlier execution.
[00:16:25] These Jews were again forced to lie face down in a row and the shooting procedure was
[00:16:30] repeated.
[00:16:34] After the pendulum traffic of the two firing squad in and out of the woods continued
[00:16:40] throughout the day.
[00:16:43] Except for a midday break, the shooting proceeded without interruption until nightfall.
[00:16:50] At some point in the afternoon, someone organized a supply of alcohol for the shooters.
[00:16:57] By the end of the day, of nearly continuous shooting, the medic completely lost track
[00:17:02] of how many Jews they had each killed.
[00:17:05] In the words of one policeman, it was, in any case, a great number.
[00:17:17] So clearly this is not what we think of when we think of the Holocaust.
[00:17:23] Good men being paired off with their victims to take out the woods and shot in the back
[00:17:27] of the head and going through this procedure the entire day.
[00:17:41] Back to the book, in contrast to first company, the men of second company received no instruction
[00:17:46] on how to carry out the shooting.
[00:17:49] Initially, bay nets were not fixed as an aiming guide and as herger noted, there was a considerable
[00:17:55] number of missed shots that led to the unnecessary wounding of the victims.
[00:18:01] One of the policemen in herger's unit likewise noted the difficulty the men had in aiming
[00:18:05] properly.
[00:18:06] At first, we shot freehand when one aimed to high the entire skull exploded as a consequence
[00:18:13] brains and bones flew everywhere.
[00:18:16] Thus we were instructed to place the bay net point on the neck.
[00:18:24] According to herger, however, using fixed bay net as an aiming guide was no solution.
[00:18:30] Through the point blank shot, though the point blank shot that was thus required, the bullet
[00:18:35] struck the head of the victim at such a trajectory that often the entire skull or at least
[00:18:40] the entire rear skull cap was torn off and blood, bone splinters and brains sprayed everywhere
[00:18:46] and besmirched the shooters.
[00:18:53] The shooter was so emphatic that no one in 1st platoon was given the option of withdrawing
[00:18:57] beforehand.
[00:18:59] But once the executions began and men approached either hammer sheer because they could
[00:19:04] not shoot women and children, they were given other duties.
[00:19:09] This was confirmed by one of his men.
[00:19:12] During the execution, words spread that anyone could not take it any longer could report.
[00:19:18] He then went on to note, I myself took part in some 10 shootings.
[00:19:23] In which I had to shoot men and women.
[00:19:27] I simply could not shoot at people anymore, which became apparent to my sergeant, herger,
[00:19:33] because at the end I repeatedly shot past.
[00:19:37] For this reason he relieved me.
[00:19:41] Other comrades were also relieved sooner or later because they simply could no longer
[00:19:47] continue.
[00:19:54] So obviously there's mixed emotions about this whole thing from the top of the chain of
[00:20:04] command right down to the front line shooters that are only able to do this so many times,
[00:20:09] some of them out of it initially.
[00:20:14] Let's remember that it's still taking place and no one's stopping it.
[00:20:18] Someone's saying some people are excusing themselves from it.
[00:20:23] But there's no one saying, hey, what the hell are we doing right now?
[00:20:31] Back to the book, some of the men who hurried at their task shot far more Jews than others
[00:20:35] who delayed as much as they could.
[00:20:39] And two rounds, one policeman simply slipped off and stayed among the trucks at the edge of
[00:20:44] the forest.
[00:20:45] Another managed to avoid taking his turn with the shooters altogether.
[00:20:49] And here's a quote from him.
[00:20:50] It was, in no way, the case that those who did not want to or could not carry out the shooting
[00:20:55] of human beings with their own hands could not keep themselves out of the task.
[00:21:00] No strict control was being carried out here.
[00:21:03] I therefore remained by the arriving trucks and kept myself busy at the arrival point.
[00:21:08] But in any case, I gave my activity such an appearance.
[00:21:12] They could not be avoided that one or another of my comrades noticed that I was not going
[00:21:17] to the executions to fire away at the victims.
[00:21:22] They shoured me with remarks such as shithead and weakling to express their disgust.
[00:21:29] But I suffered no consequences for my actions.
[00:21:34] I must mention here that I was not the only one who kept themselves out of participating
[00:21:39] in the executions.
[00:21:43] So guys, like I said, have figured out that they can not participate if they don't want
[00:21:48] to.
[00:21:51] And they're getting called cowards and weaklings by the guys that are actually cowards
[00:21:57] and weaklings that are going out and executing people back to the book as with first company
[00:22:07] alcohol is made available to the policeman under Drucker and Steinmeetz, who stayed in
[00:22:13] the forest and continued shooting.
[00:22:17] As darkness approached at the end of a long summer day and the murderous task was still
[00:22:21] not finished, the shooting became even less organized and more hectic.
[00:22:26] The forest was so full of dead bodies that it was difficult to find places to make the
[00:22:31] Jews lie down.
[00:22:42] So they complete this massacre and they head back to their barracks and here we go back
[00:22:54] to the book when the men arrived back at the barracks.
[00:22:57] They were depressed, angered, inbittered and shaken.
[00:23:01] They ate little but drink heavily.
[00:23:05] Generous quantities of alcohol were provided and many of the policemen got quite drunk.
[00:23:11] Major trap made the rounds trying to console and reassure them and again placing the responsibility
[00:23:17] on higher authorities.
[00:23:22] You're not allowed to do that.
[00:23:29] But neither the drink nor traps consolation could wash away the sense of shame and horror
[00:23:35] that pervaded the barracks.
[00:23:41] So that was the first police action that they did.
[00:23:47] This took place in Poland.
[00:23:53] And to give you what they did.
[00:23:58] You hear some people that had a hard time with it.
[00:24:01] But still like I said, that was a small percentage of 10% maybe 15% of people that said
[00:24:06] no, I'm not going to do it.
[00:24:07] That hit or made themselves busy with other things.
[00:24:11] Most of the guys just went ahead and did what they were told to do.
[00:24:16] You think you're so okay, well who were these guys?
[00:24:19] Were they hardened combat veterans from the front line?
[00:24:24] Were they young sort of brainwashed Nazi youth that were that's what they believed in?
[00:24:33] And they just they their mind just saw that as the reality that they had to go through
[00:24:38] with.
[00:24:39] And this is the strange thing about this book is that that's not what it is.
[00:24:45] It's not who these guys were and now I'll go to the book to talk about who they actually
[00:24:49] were.
[00:24:51] For the most part, reserve but reserve police battalion 101 was now composed of men without
[00:24:57] any experience of German occupation methods in Eastern Europe.
[00:25:00] All for that matter with the exception of the very oldest who were World War I veterans
[00:25:05] any kind of military service.
[00:25:07] Most of these guys aren't even from the military.
[00:25:10] Battalion consisted of 11 officers, five administrative officials in charge of financial
[00:25:15] matters relating to playing, provisioning, lodging, etc.
[00:25:19] and 486 non-commissioned officers in men.
[00:25:23] The battalion was divided into three companies, each of them, approximately 140 men,
[00:25:27] when it full strength, two companies were commanded by police captains and the third by
[00:25:31] senior reserve lieutenant in the battalion.
[00:25:33] Each company was divided into three platoons, two them commanded by reserve lieutenants,
[00:25:38] and the third by a platoon senior sergeant.
[00:25:40] So this is kind of a normal military makeup.
[00:25:45] The battalion was commanded by 53-year-old Major Wilhelm Trap, World War I veteran and recipient
[00:25:52] of the Iron Cross First Class.
[00:25:56] Now we know World War I obviously was a brutal war and he's a survivor of that, awarded
[00:26:02] the Iron Cross First Class fought for Germany and lost.
[00:26:08] What he'd do after the war, back to the book after the war he became a career policeman
[00:26:12] and rose through the ranks.
[00:26:14] He'd recently been promoted from captain of second company and this was his first battalion
[00:26:19] command.
[00:26:21] Though Trap had joined the Nazi Party in December of 1932 and thus technically qualified
[00:26:27] as an old party fighter or alter-comfer, he had never been taken into the SS or even given
[00:26:35] an equivalent SS rank.
[00:26:38] And despite of the fact that himler and hijrick consciously tried to merge and intertwine
[00:26:43] to state and party components of their SS police empire, Trap was clearly not considered
[00:26:49] SS material.
[00:26:51] So, and you're going to see this, these guys, I mean there's a war going on.
[00:26:58] So why are these guys in a police battalion as opposed to being on the front lines fighting
[00:27:02] the war?
[00:27:03] The reason is because they're not quite the right material to go out and fight.
[00:27:08] And by the way, we're going to get to a point soon in the war where there's some 14-year-old
[00:27:12] Hitler youth going out to fight.
[00:27:14] But these guys aren't being selected.
[00:27:19] Back to the book, he was soon to come into conflict with his two captains both young SS men
[00:27:25] who even in their testimony more than 20 years later made no attempt to conceal their
[00:27:28] contempt for their commander as weak, unmilitary, and unduly interfering in the duties
[00:27:34] of his officers.
[00:27:36] So he's got a couple police captains that were a little bit more hardcore.
[00:27:40] Let me tell you about them.
[00:27:42] Wolfgang Hoffman, he was born in 1914, 16 years old, he was in Hitler youth in 1932 at 18.
[00:27:56] He was in the SS, graduated from gymnasium, which is a college preparatory high school in
[00:28:02] 34, during the police force in 1936 entered the Nazi party in 1937.
[00:28:09] Same year he completed police training, it was commissioned as a lieutenant, and now he's
[00:28:13] in the reserves in 1942 reserve police battalion 101.
[00:28:18] So he'd come up through the ranks as a Nazi.
[00:28:24] But still, even him, I mean his formative years is born in 1914.
[00:28:29] So it's not like it's all he knew.
[00:28:33] He went from 1914 to what 1933, 1930, so he was 16 years old, he had been formed, lived as
[00:28:41] a normal German before the Nazi party was around.
[00:28:44] We're not talking a brainwashed, complete Nazi youth.
[00:28:47] Same thing with the other guy born in 1913, this is Julius Wolhoff.
[00:28:54] So graduated from gymnasium, joined the Nazi party in 1933, 1936 became SS.
[00:29:02] So these guys are more engaged in the whole Nazi party and obviously towing the line along
[00:29:15] that.
[00:29:17] So that's the two police captains that are in charge of a couple of the companies inside
[00:29:22] the battalion.
[00:29:23] Now let's talk a little bit about the men, the men aged generally from 33 to 48 years old.
[00:29:31] Five were party members, none of them belonged to the SS, of the back of the book of the 32
[00:29:36] non-commissioned officers on whom we have information 22 were party members in seven were
[00:29:40] in the SS.
[00:29:41] They ranged in age from 27 to 40 years old, their average age was 33 and a half.
[00:29:48] They were not reserved, but rather pre-war recruits to the police.
[00:29:53] Of the rank and file, so now we're just talking about the troops, the 400 plus troops.
[00:29:57] Of the rank and file, the vast majority were from the Hamburg area, 63% were working class
[00:30:02] background, but fewer skilled laborers.
[00:30:05] The majority of them held typical Hamburg, working class jobs, dock workers and truck drivers,
[00:30:10] were most numerous, but there are also many warehouse and construction workers, machine
[00:30:14] operators, seamen and waiters, about 35% were lower middle class virtually all of them white
[00:30:20] collar workers.
[00:30:22] Three quarters of them were in sales of some sort.
[00:30:25] The other one quarter formed various office jobs in both government and private sector,
[00:30:30] the number of independent artisans and small businesses, businessmen were very small,
[00:30:36] only a handful, 2% were middle class professionals and very modest ones at that, such
[00:30:42] as drugists and teachers, the average age of the men was 39.
[00:30:50] Over half were between 37 and 42.
[00:30:52] A group considered two-old for the army, but most heavily conscripted for reserve police
[00:30:57] duty after September 1939.
[00:30:59] So the men are there, they're 30, 40 years old, 35, 40 years old.
[00:31:07] These guys are fully developed, right?
[00:31:08] They're not impressionable.
[00:31:10] Yeah, they're not impressionable guys that are just raised inside the Nazi culture,
[00:31:15] because I mean, let's face it.
[00:31:16] If you're raised in any cultish religion scenario, there's a really good chance that that's
[00:31:23] what you're going to believe in and you don't understand any other way of thinking.
[00:31:28] So you can, I don't know if you can be a good excuse, but it's understandable how
[00:31:34] you end up that way.
[00:31:38] Back to the book, The Men of Reserve Police Battalion, where from the lower orders of
[00:31:42] German society, they'd experienced neither social nor geographic mobility, by virtue of their
[00:31:47] age.
[00:31:48] And here's what we're just talking about.
[00:31:49] By virtue of their age, of course, all went through their formative period in the pre-Nazi
[00:31:54] area.
[00:31:56] These were men who had known political standards and moral norms other than those of the
[00:32:00] Nazis.
[00:32:01] Most came from Hamburg, by reputation one of the least not-to-fied cities in Germany.
[00:32:06] And the majority came from a social class that had been anti-Nazi in its political culture.
[00:32:13] These men would not seem to have been a very promising group from which to recruit mass
[00:32:18] murderers on behalf of Nazi vision of a racial utopia, free of Jews.
[00:32:26] And I think the title of this book is Ordinary Men.
[00:32:32] And that's why, because that's what we're talking about here, Ordinary Men.
[00:32:37] I mean, that's about a clear cross-section of society that you could come up with.
[00:32:43] I mean, you come up with the same cross-section of society in America.
[00:32:46] Much of guys are working as construction workers, waiters, truck drivers, dock workers.
[00:32:50] I mean, that's what that's what people do.
[00:32:53] Oh, what age are they?
[00:32:55] They're 35, 40 years old.
[00:32:56] Okay.
[00:32:57] Is that the group that you think is going to be all you're going to be able to take out and
[00:33:00] get them to murder thousands and thousands of people face to face?
[00:33:04] Okay.
[00:33:05] Now, there's a section here that the reflections on the massacre itself.
[00:33:15] And it's talking about this first, like I said, this first thing that took place in
[00:33:22] your self-fulf, it was that they're first big action as a group.
[00:33:27] So here we go back to the book.
[00:33:28] You're so at your self-fulf, a mere dozen men out of nearly 500 are responded instinctively
[00:33:34] to major traps offered a step forward and excused themselves from the impending mass murder.
[00:33:39] Why was the number of men from the beginning declared themselves, who from the beginning
[00:33:45] declared themselves unwilling to shoot so small?
[00:33:48] Any kind of officer's explanation here.
[00:33:49] It's like the suddenness of it.
[00:33:52] And people are kind of surprised.
[00:33:54] And I can make sense of that, right?
[00:33:57] Like if I gave you time to say, if I was like, hey, echo, we got to go do this thing right
[00:34:00] now.
[00:34:01] You probably be like, okay, cool, let's go do it.
[00:34:03] But if I said, hey, echo, then we're going to go do something tomorrow.
[00:34:08] Tomorrow, you know, I'll pick you up at 10 30.
[00:34:13] Let me know.
[00:34:14] Well now you have time to contemplate.
[00:34:15] So he surprised him with it.
[00:34:18] There's also obviously there was pure pressure to conform.
[00:34:25] And you know, that's going to play role.
[00:34:28] And he will talk about that more later.
[00:34:30] Going back to the book, nonetheless, the act of stepping out that morning in your Sephoth,
[00:34:35] meant leaving one's comrades and admitting that one was too weak or cowardly.
[00:34:41] Who would have dared one policeman declared him fathically to lose face before the assembled
[00:34:46] troops?
[00:34:48] If the questions posed to me, why I shot with the others in the first place said another
[00:34:52] who subsequently asked to be excused after several rounds of killing, I must answer that no
[00:34:57] one wants to be thought a coward.
[00:35:01] It was one thing to refuse at the beginning he added and quite another to try and shoot,
[00:35:05] but not be able to continue.
[00:35:09] Another policeman, more aware of what truly required courage said quite simply, I was cowardly.
[00:35:16] So that person gets it.
[00:35:18] You know, these people, the shooters are saying, hey, I don't want to be a coward, so I wanted
[00:35:22] to go shoot.
[00:35:24] When I actually to stand up and say, no, that's what would have taken real moral courage
[00:35:28] at this point.
[00:35:29] And obviously, these guys knew what they were doing was wrong.
[00:35:35] They knew it.
[00:35:36] That's why some of them weren't able to continue.
[00:35:41] Now speaking of cowardly, here's a little section that I thought, you should be pointed
[00:35:48] out and we were talking about this before the podcast, how people rationalize things.
[00:35:53] Yeah.
[00:35:54] Well, listen to this rationalization.
[00:35:55] Perhaps the most astounding rationalization of all was that of a 35-year-old metal
[00:36:00] worker from Bremmerhaven.
[00:36:03] Quote, I made the effort and it was possible for me to shoot only children.
[00:36:11] So happened that the mothers led the children by the hand.
[00:36:14] My neighbor then shot the mother and I shot the child that belonged to her because I
[00:36:18] reasoned with myself that, after all, without its mother, the child could not live any
[00:36:23] longer.
[00:36:26] It was supposed to be, so to speak, soothing to my conscience to release the children unable
[00:36:32] to live without their mothers.
[00:36:38] And actually, he goes in here and talks about the German word for release also means to
[00:36:44] like redeem or save.
[00:36:46] So this guy's really twisted things up in his head.
[00:36:53] The dangers of rationalization right there, good God.
[00:36:58] Back to the book with few exceptions, the whole question of anti-Semitism is marked by
[00:37:03] silence.
[00:37:04] So this is interesting.
[00:37:07] This is very interesting.
[00:37:09] As they, and I should have pointed this out earlier, but this book is based on all these
[00:37:14] different interviews and witness accounts mostly of the policemen themselves.
[00:37:21] Now, and again, I should have pointed this out in the beginning.
[00:37:25] Of course, people are making witness statements and there's all kinds of problems with
[00:37:29] those, right?
[00:37:30] They don't remember things correctly.
[00:37:32] They're trying to protect themselves.
[00:37:33] They're trying to protect their friends.
[00:37:38] They're trying to indict certain people and make them look like the bad guy.
[00:37:39] They might be trying to make themselves look good.
[00:37:40] So there's all these kind of angles that you have to listen to.
[00:37:46] You have to understand this with.
[00:37:49] But this is interesting.
[00:37:51] As they interview these guys, back to the book with few exceptions, the whole question
[00:37:56] of anti-Semitism is marked by silence.
[00:37:59] What is clear is that the men's concern for their standing in the eyes of their comrades
[00:38:04] was not matched by any sense of human ties with their victims.
[00:38:08] The Jews stood outside their circle of human obligation and responsibility.
[00:38:13] Such a polarization between us and them between ones comrades and the enemy is, of course,
[00:38:19] standard and war.
[00:38:20] And it is indeed.
[00:38:21] But I guess what surprised me is these guys weren't going in there with thinking themselves.
[00:38:26] Okay, these are the Jews that are doing us wrong and we're going to get our chance.
[00:38:30] They were just kind of saying, well, they're not us.
[00:38:33] So we'll do what we have to do.
[00:38:41] Back to the book.
[00:38:42] Even 20 or 25 years later, those who did quit shooting along the way, overwhelmingly cited
[00:38:48] sheer physical revulsion against what they were doing as the prim motive, but the not
[00:38:53] expressed any ethical or political principles behind this revolson.
[00:38:57] So that's interesting.
[00:38:59] These guys were stopping because it made them feel sick.
[00:39:03] And they weren't saying, look, I'm actually what I've been saying is like, hey, these
[00:39:09] guys knew it was wrong.
[00:39:10] Well, they didn't think of it as wrong or at least this is explaining that they weren't
[00:39:16] thinking, oh, this is so wrong.
[00:39:18] What they were thinking was, I'm going to be sick.
[00:39:19] Now, any rational person can figure out that if something makes you sick to do, then you've
[00:39:27] got some deep-seated knowledge that what you're doing is wrong.
[00:39:33] Yeah, it seems like that that was like the moral part of it right or wrong.
[00:39:38] And so that wasn't the primary.
[00:39:40] The primary was just, I can't take the blood and gut.
[00:39:42] Yes, man.
[00:39:43] I can't take the blood and gut.
[00:39:44] Yeah, you're exactly right.
[00:39:45] Now, like I said, there's a connection.
[00:39:47] And I don't think he makes it in the book.
[00:39:48] But in my mind, there's a connection.
[00:39:50] If you're doing something that makes you feel sick, it's not just the making you feel
[00:39:56] sick.
[00:39:57] That should be bothering you.
[00:39:58] What should be bothering you is the fact that you're doing something that makes you
[00:40:00] feel sick.
[00:40:01] There's a reason why it makes you feel sick.
[00:40:03] There's a reason why human beings feel sick when they're laying down children and shooting
[00:40:08] in the back of the head.
[00:40:09] There's a reason for that.
[00:40:11] That's a, that's a, that's a, it's like a survival instinct, right?
[00:40:16] Or you're, for your species to carry on.
[00:40:19] You have to make the other members of your species survive.
[00:40:23] Yeah, especially if just like I said, there wasn't like some enemy kind of feeling
[00:40:29] towards you like, you know, it's not like, oh, we're defending ourselves against this enemy.
[00:40:33] You know, wasn't that it was just that it was essentially the minimum requirement to go
[00:40:38] against somebody.
[00:40:39] They're not.
[00:40:40] Yeah, and he's going to go into this a little bit.
[00:40:41] But yeah, you're right.
[00:40:42] It's not, it's not like there's, you know, he says, hey, there's, there's women and
[00:40:46] children being bombed back in Germany right now.
[00:40:48] But there's no direct correlation.
[00:40:50] They're not saying, hey, look, these Jews are fighting us.
[00:40:53] They're going to take over.
[00:40:54] They've got ground and, you know, on our borders.
[00:40:57] No, but I'd say that.
[00:40:58] They're actually in total control of the Jews at this point.
[00:41:02] Or they're not total control.
[00:41:03] What they're getting really close.
[00:41:05] Getting really close.
[00:41:06] Back to the book, the resentment and bitterness and the battalion over what they had
[00:41:14] been asked to do.
[00:41:16] And Yosafov was shared by virtually everyone, even those who had shot the entire day.
[00:41:22] The exclamation of one policeman to first sergeant camera of the first company that I'd
[00:41:26] go crazy if I had to do that again, express the sentiments of many.
[00:41:33] But few went beyond complaining to extricate themselves from such a possibility.
[00:41:38] So I also said, hey, I don't want to rather do that again.
[00:41:41] But very few of them said, actually made a stand.
[00:41:45] The most dramatic back to the book, the most dramatic response again was that of Lieutenant
[00:41:49] Buckman, who asked Trump to have him transferred back to Hamburg and declared that
[00:41:54] short of a direct personal order from Trump, he would not take part in Jewish actions.
[00:41:59] In the end, he wrote to Hamburg explicitly requesting a recall because he was not suited
[00:42:04] to certain tasks alien to the police that were being carried out by his unit in Poland.
[00:42:11] I mean, he had waited, had to wait until November, but his efforts to be transferred were
[00:42:14] ultimately successful.
[00:42:16] So there's a guy that's one guy that they're citing that actually said, dude, I'm not
[00:42:21] going to do this.
[00:42:25] Now it was bad enough and did have a bad enough effect on the men and they complained about
[00:42:30] enough that there was some changes.
[00:42:32] So here we go back to the book in subsequent actions.
[00:42:35] Two vital changes were introduced henceforth with some notable exceptions adhered to.
[00:42:40] First, most of the future operations of the reserve police battalion 101 involved ghetto
[00:42:48] clearing and deportation, not outright massacre on the spot.
[00:42:53] The policeman were thus relieved of the immediate horror of the killing process, which
[00:42:58] for deportees from the northern Loughlin district was carried out in the extermination camp
[00:43:05] at Trublinka.
[00:43:08] So now we're not going to, you don't have to go shoot them.
[00:43:12] You just got to gather them up and get them shipped off to the extermination camp.
[00:43:19] Second, while deportation was a horrifying procedure characterized by the terrible coercive
[00:43:24] violence needed to drive people onto the death trains as well as the systematic killing
[00:43:30] of those who could not be marched to the trains, these actions were generally undertaken
[00:43:34] jointly by units of reserve police battalion 101 and the Trunicis.
[00:43:40] SS trained auxiliaries from the Soviet territories recruited from the Russian POW camps and
[00:43:48] usually assigned to the very worst parts of the ghetto clearing and deportation.
[00:43:52] So imagine this group, you get a group of fugs that are from Russian POW camps and
[00:43:59] you say, yeah, we'll let you out of this POW camp and you can come work for us and
[00:44:05] they're trained by the SS, not exactly a friendly crew of guys.
[00:44:12] In fact, that's like, I can't imagine a worse group of people to come and come after
[00:44:19] you.
[00:44:22] Back to the book, the bulk of the killing was to be removed to the extermination camp
[00:44:25] and the worst of the on the spot dirty work was to be assigned to the Trunicis.
[00:44:33] This change would prove sufficient to allow the men of reserve police battalion 101 to become
[00:44:37] accustomed to their participation in the final solution when the time came to kill again
[00:44:43] the policemen did not go crazy.
[00:44:45] Instead they became increasingly efficient in Calist executioners.
[00:44:53] So a couple of changes, it was obviously it was too much for them to actually do all the
[00:44:59] killing themselves.
[00:45:00] Now they got some people to help them out and or they are just going to gather them up
[00:45:06] and ship them away and they'll not only play in a little piece in the in the in the
[00:45:11] machine, right?
[00:45:13] Just a little piece of the machine.
[00:45:14] So it's a lot easier to detach from what's actually happening back to the book, the
[00:45:19] Jews of Lomazi were to be the target of reserve battalion 101's first joint killing
[00:45:25] action with the unit from the Trunicis.
[00:45:29] Second company was to provide the bulk of the manpower for the roundup.
[00:45:33] The primary function of the Trunicis was unit was to provide the shooters thus alleviating
[00:45:41] the chief psychological burden the German policemen had experienced at Yoselfov.
[00:45:51] And here the the orders come out, they're going in and now there's another term that
[00:46:00] comes up.
[00:46:01] It's it has to do with the Trunicis but it's hewis and it's short.
[00:46:08] I forget what the German words are but hewis is short for two big German words.
[00:46:13] One of them that means a willing and one of them that means helper.
[00:46:17] So they called these these sort of people that had come to the German side and we're
[00:46:21] not they called him hewis and it's like I said it's stands for willing helper.
[00:46:27] It's like it's like using you've heard the term spec war.
[00:46:32] That's that's where special warfare.
[00:46:33] This is the same thing with two German words that mean willing helper.
[00:46:39] So here you go back to book the NCOs were told that the hewis from Trunicis would do
[00:46:44] the shooting.
[00:46:46] So the policeman would for the most part be spared.
[00:46:49] Nonetheless the roundup was to be conducted as had been done before which is to say
[00:46:53] that infants and the old sick and frail who could not be easily taken to the assembly
[00:46:58] point were to be shot on the spot.
[00:47:00] So not out of all the killing.
[00:47:03] According to one squad leader however most children were once again brought to the assembly
[00:47:06] point.
[00:47:08] As NCOs of the men encountered not only German Jews but specifically Hamburg Jews during
[00:47:14] the clearing action.
[00:47:16] The Jews quickly filled the school yard and overflowed into the adjoining sports field
[00:47:21] with some shooting the roundup was finished in two short hours.
[00:47:27] So that's it.
[00:47:29] That's a real sort of one sentence and if you can just try and imagine what the hell is
[00:47:35] going on there.
[00:47:37] These soldiers, these Russian soldiers, these Germans, soldiers are coming in and rounding
[00:47:42] people up there using violence, shooting people to get all the Jews into the school
[00:47:48] yard.
[00:47:50] This is a nightmare scenario that they boost that you know he puts in a sentence here.
[00:47:59] After the book the 1700 Jews of Lumazzi were then forced to sit and wait.
[00:48:05] A group of 60 to 70 young men were selected out given shovels and spades loaded onto trucks
[00:48:10] and driven to the woods.
[00:48:13] Several of the young Jews jumped from the moving trucks and made good their escape.
[00:48:18] Another attacked a German corporal, the battalion boxing champion who promptly knocked
[00:48:24] his desperate assailants senseless.
[00:48:28] And the woods, the Jews were set to digging a mass grave.
[00:48:33] Back in Lumazzi, the weight of the doomed Jews and their police guards stretched into
[00:48:39] hours.
[00:48:40] Suddenly a contingent of 50, he weas from Truninki, marched into town, led by a German SS officer.
[00:48:49] I can still remember exactly one policeman testified that immediately after the arrival
[00:48:54] of these Truniques took a break.
[00:48:56] After their arrival the Truniques took a break, I saw that in addition to food, they also
[00:49:01] took out bottles of vodka out of their packs and drink from them.
[00:49:06] The SS officer and Gnad, this is a guy that arrived on the scene now grenade, began drinking
[00:49:13] heavily as well.
[00:49:15] The other NCOs, smelled of alcohol but unlike the two commanders were not visibly drunk.
[00:49:23] So these guys are drinking vodka and they know what they're about to have to go do.
[00:49:28] Now we're talking about this guy Lieutenant Nade.
[00:49:31] Lieutenant Nade was a Nazi by conviction and an anti-Semite.
[00:49:36] He was also unpredictable, affable and approachable at times, brutal and vicious at others.
[00:49:45] And here's an eyewitness account from one of the soldiers back to the book, even before
[00:49:50] the shooting began, first Lieutenant Nade had personally picked out some 20 to 25 elderly
[00:49:56] Jews.
[00:49:58] They were exclusively men with full beards.
[00:50:01] Nade made the old men crawl on the ground in the area before the grave.
[00:50:07] Before he gave them the order to crawl, they had to undress.
[00:50:11] While the totally naked Jews crawled, first Lieutenant Nade screamed to those around,
[00:50:17] where are my non-commissioned officers?
[00:50:20] Don't you have any clubs yet?
[00:50:24] The non-commissioned officers went to the edge of the forest, fetched themselves clubs and vigorously
[00:50:29] beat the Jews with them.
[00:50:40] They get the mass-grave dug.
[00:50:49] And here we go, immediately large numbers of Jews were driven into the grave and the
[00:50:53] hewies took their position on the walls that had been thrown up from there they shot
[00:50:58] the victims.
[00:51:00] As the shooting continued, the grave began to fill.
[00:51:05] The Jews who followed had to climb on and later even clamber over those shot earlier because
[00:51:11] the grave was filled with corpses almost to the edge.
[00:51:23] The NCOs decided that the execution should continue with two firing squads on opposite
[00:51:27] sides of the grave.
[00:51:29] The Jews were forced to lie down and rose alongside each other each side of the grave and
[00:51:34] were shot by the police standing on the opposite wall.
[00:51:37] Men from all three potuins were formed into squads of eight to ten and were relieved by
[00:51:42] others in a rotation after five or six shots.
[00:51:46] After about two hours the hewies were roused from their stupor and resumed shooting in
[00:51:52] place the German policemen.
[00:51:55] The shooting was finished around 7 p.m. and the work Jews who had been kept aside covered
[00:52:01] the grave.
[00:52:03] The work Jews were then shot as well.
[00:52:07] The thin covering of the overfill grave continued to move.
[00:52:19] So you got people that are not dead that are now buried alive.
[00:52:28] There was a part that I didn't cover basically the hewies got too drunk to continue on
[00:52:33] and the police had to go and take their place for a while and then they kind of recovered.
[00:52:38] But this is this is the situation that we're talking about.
[00:52:42] Just a complete nightmare.
[00:52:46] Back to the book.
[00:52:47] One other factor sharply distinguished at Lomazzi from Yosifov and Maywell have been yet another
[00:52:52] kind of psychological relief for the men, namely, and this is important from a psychological
[00:52:59] and from a leadership perspective.
[00:53:05] One other factor sharply distinguished Lomazzi from Yosifov and Maywell have been yet another
[00:53:12] kind of psychological relief for the men.
[00:53:15] Namely, this time they did not bear the burden of choice that trap had offered them so starkly
[00:53:21] on the occasion of the first massacre.
[00:53:24] No chance to step out was given to those who did not feel up to the shooting.
[00:53:30] No one systematically excused those who were visibly too shaken to continue.
[00:53:36] Everyone assigned to the firing squad took his turn as ordered.
[00:53:40] Therefore those who shot did not have to live with clear awareness that they had what
[00:53:45] they had done had been unavoidable.
[00:53:49] That's a big difference, the big difference.
[00:53:54] And from a leadership perspective, that's something that I've actually talked about this
[00:53:59] before.
[00:54:02] It's interesting when we were in the body.
[00:54:06] We tasked you to bruise, we kind of decided what we were going to do.
[00:54:11] We weren't getting told to go do this.
[00:54:15] So everything that we did, we did because we decided that we could mitigate the risk,
[00:54:21] and we could take this good operation, and we could, there was an area that we could
[00:54:26] do a good job in.
[00:54:27] So we had a lot of control over our fate.
[00:54:32] And that's actually can be psychologically heavier because if something goes wrong, it's all
[00:54:41] on you as the leader.
[00:54:43] Or as the leadership team, or even as the guys that are on the front of the point man,
[00:54:47] the point man selecting his own, you know, going down to the front line troops, the
[00:54:52] point man is selecting the route.
[00:54:54] If he hits an IED, sure, you know, it's the enemy's fault.
[00:54:59] But he's thinking to himself, why did I choose that route?
[00:55:03] Now the army, they did have some control, but they had more often than not.
[00:55:08] They'd be getting told, hey, you're going to go on a patrol down this road or
[00:55:10] hey, you're going to go hit this building.
[00:55:11] So they were relieved oftentimes of that freedom of choice.
[00:55:19] So the freedom of choice can be a little bit of a burden.
[00:55:21] And so what happened here was the freedom of choice was taken away.
[00:55:25] And that burden was there for taking away.
[00:55:26] Look, you're going to go to shut up and do this.
[00:55:29] Guys, I'm okay.
[00:55:30] Yeah, because you have like, if you have that choice, like back to the part where the
[00:55:34] 12 guys stepped out.
[00:55:38] And yeah, we can look at it as the guys who stepped out have more courage because they're
[00:55:43] not essentially, there's two things to be kind of scared of or have courage against.
[00:55:51] One is, okay, I'm not scared to kill these people.
[00:55:55] I'm not scared to pull the trigger.
[00:55:57] And then there's, I'm not scared to go against the norms.
[00:56:01] Yeah, you know, which is a bigger kind of thing.
[00:56:03] Oh, much harder.
[00:56:04] Yeah.
[00:56:05] And you have the choice, which one are you going to do?
[00:56:09] You know, if you, if they give you the choice, okay, you can step out.
[00:56:11] If you want, what are you going to do?
[00:56:12] Everyone's looking at you like, okay, are you going to, I wonder what the tipping point
[00:56:16] would have been.
[00:56:17] In other words, like you chose to do it.
[00:56:19] No, if, if 10 people, but then what if it was 30, what if it was 40?
[00:56:24] And you see that anytime in a crowd.
[00:56:25] Yeah.
[00:56:26] You see that stupid video where there's like one guy he's dancing by himself.
[00:56:32] And it's like some viral video.
[00:56:33] Is it kind of old school?
[00:56:35] I don't know, but it's, it's a stupid viral video.
[00:56:37] You don't have to go watch it yourself, but I'll explain what happens.
[00:56:40] There's a guy there, like some kind of a concert, some kind of an outdoor concert.
[00:56:44] There's a guy dancing by himself.
[00:56:46] He's dancing by himself for a long time.
[00:56:48] And that's why I saw it, this company was talking about like group or they used this as
[00:56:52] an example of group psychology.
[00:56:54] The guy's dancing for by himself for a long time.
[00:56:57] And what they're actually saying is that the person that has the courage is actually
[00:57:01] the second person that joins him.
[00:57:03] So anyways, the one person's dancing is dancing by himself for several minutes.
[00:57:09] Then another person joins him.
[00:57:13] Once the other person joins him, then all of a sudden five people.
[00:57:18] And then it's 20 people.
[00:57:19] And then the next thing you know, everyone is dancing.
[00:57:22] And I wonder what the tipping point would have been here.
[00:57:24] Yeah.
[00:57:25] You get 10 people out of 500.
[00:57:27] That wasn't enough.
[00:57:28] Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:57:29] But you know, what if all of a sudden 15, 20, 30, 40 people would have stepped forward.
[00:57:33] Then all of a sudden, does it just everyone says, hey, we're not doing this.
[00:57:37] Yeah.
[00:57:38] Yeah, I think if they knew, I wonder if they knew for sure that there wasn't going to,
[00:57:42] you know, because some guys were getting called names.
[00:57:44] Well, yeah.
[00:57:45] And I think it was the suddenness that he talked about in the book.
[00:57:47] Yeah.
[00:57:48] If you'd have said, okay, listen tomorrow.
[00:57:49] Yeah.
[00:57:50] We're going to do, we're going to want to kill a bunch of women and children,
[00:57:53] point blank range in the woods.
[00:57:54] Yeah.
[00:57:55] You're going to have to shoot them off.
[00:57:56] Yeah.
[00:57:57] Let me know if you're down.
[00:57:58] Yeah.
[00:57:59] And then if you had done that, but then given them hours to sit there and think about it.
[00:58:03] Yeah.
[00:58:04] And then the next guy is like, hey, what are you going to do with them?
[00:58:06] Yeah.
[00:58:07] Then it may have spread.
[00:58:08] Yeah.
[00:58:09] But that peer pressure was hardcore.
[00:58:10] That's what I mean.
[00:58:11] It was hardcore.
[00:58:12] So that, yeah, especially like I said, if they're scared of the authority, it's like,
[00:58:16] okay, the tipping point is going to be more for sure.
[00:58:19] But like, you know, you do something like, you know, you're example or you ever see, you
[00:58:23] know, you see this all the time where you say something, you're on stage, you say something
[00:58:26] kind of cool.
[00:58:28] Not, you know, it's not the end of your presentation.
[00:58:30] You say something kind of cool. And then one guy starts clapping and then everyone starts clapping.
[00:58:33] Right.
[00:58:34] It's kind of that thing where this is no consequence to clapping.
[00:58:37] So it's like, oh, shoot.
[00:58:38] That's what we're doing.
[00:58:39] Okay.
[00:58:40] I, I all clap.
[00:58:41] I feel good about clapping.
[00:58:42] I'm going to do it.
[00:58:43] You know, kind of thing.
[00:58:44] There's no real resistance.
[00:58:45] So the tipping point is going to be one guy.
[00:58:46] That's the tipping point.
[00:58:47] But you get something where there's going to be, there might be some resistance, some
[00:58:49] risk, you know, of pain or, you know, whatever kind of punishment.
[00:58:53] Yeah, the tipping point is going to be more, I think.
[00:58:55] Yeah.
[00:58:56] I wonder what that is, man, because it's not like, like, the nuts.
[00:59:00] The regime was very understanding.
[00:59:03] No.
[00:59:04] No.
[00:59:05] No.
[00:59:06] I mean, you know, pretty much you can say that most military units aren't very understanding.
[00:59:12] You know, there's going to be a certain level of like a, there's discipline in place
[00:59:18] for a reason.
[00:59:19] And you can get away.
[00:59:20] You know, I talk about all the time.
[00:59:22] You know, I said, look, you can't just order people to do things.
[00:59:24] It only lasts for so long.
[00:59:25] Yeah.
[00:59:26] But how long do you need to last here?
[00:59:27] And only need to last a night.
[00:59:28] You can get everyone to do what you need them to do tonight.
[00:59:30] You know, we're okay.
[00:59:33] We got through our mission.
[00:59:35] And now I'll let them, you know, what do you do?
[00:59:38] He actually let them go get drunk and, you know, talk to them and build up some more leadership
[00:59:43] capital because he expanded, he expanded a bunch of leadership capital to get this mission
[00:59:48] done.
[00:59:49] And now he's got to rebuild it and kind of get a big development as relationship again
[00:59:53] with the guys and bring in some other changes.
[00:59:57] Hey, look, we're not going to do all the killing this time.
[00:59:59] So yeah, man, it's crazy.
[01:00:02] It's, I thought it was pretty surprising.
[01:00:05] And I'd be kind of a few kind of psychos saying refreshing to know that they didn't get
[01:00:09] that much punishment aside from some name calling, you know, because you don't think
[01:00:15] over that like that.
[01:00:16] I think when you think of it like all this in it, you know, they got to say, you're
[01:00:21] saying, yeah, people.
[01:00:23] They got, yeah.
[01:00:24] Yeah, all the guy was named called.
[01:00:25] Yeah.
[01:00:26] And that's another thing that they brought that money changed the tipping point.
[01:00:29] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:30] When they realized, you know, those guys that stepped forward, they might have thought
[01:00:32] they get put in the ditch because there's some, and I didn't cover this part, but there's
[01:00:35] there's definitely some parts where guys like, hey, we'll put you in the ditch.
[01:00:38] That's actually what we do your job.
[01:00:40] Yeah.
[01:00:41] But I think that reveals the discomfort of the overall situation.
[01:00:46] Yeah.
[01:00:47] And when looking at their buddy saying, no, I'm going to kill you now.
[01:00:49] They were like, hey, actually, I kind of agree with you, but you just say over there, I
[01:00:52] will go forward.
[01:00:53] No.
[01:00:54] Okay, so the next situation that they get into are these deportations to triple
[01:01:01] ink of the death camp.
[01:01:03] And here we go, back to the book.
[01:01:06] While the policemen did not know precisely where the Jews were being sent or what was
[01:01:10] being done with them, it was all clear and well-known to all of us as Heinrich Steinmetz
[01:01:19] admitted that for the Jews affected these deportations meant the path to death.
[01:01:24] We suspected that they would be killed in some sort of camp.
[01:01:30] Spared direct participation in the killing, the men of reserved police battalion 101 seemed
[01:01:36] scarcely too have been disturbed by this awareness.
[01:01:40] Even though there were more victims in the deportations than in Yosifo or Lomaze,
[01:01:46] massacres combined, out of sight was truly out of mind.
[01:01:52] So now they're in this mode of just doing the deportations.
[01:01:55] Now I say just doing the deportations and I don't want to make that sound like it was
[01:02:00] in a brutal, vicious exercise that they were doing.
[01:02:05] Here we go back to the book, driven by the hewis and policemen thousands of Jews steamed
[01:02:09] into the marketplace, streamed into the marketplace.
[01:02:12] Here they had to sit or squat without moving or getting up as the hours passed on this very
[01:02:16] hot August of the late summer heat wave.
[01:02:19] They Jews fainted and collapsed, moreover beating and shooting continued in the marketplace.
[01:02:26] And I don't know if I quoted this in here if I'll get to it.
[01:02:29] But these guys, they're shooting people.
[01:02:32] They're also bringing out whips, sort of whipping people.
[01:02:35] It's brutal.
[01:02:36] Back to the book, one final horror was reserved to the end for the train cars now had to
[01:02:42] be loaded.
[01:02:43] While the hewis and security police packed 120 to 140 Jews into each car, the reserve
[01:02:49] policemen stood guard and observed.
[01:02:52] As one remembered, when it didn't go well, they made use of riding whips and guns.
[01:02:58] The loading was simply frightful.
[01:03:00] There was an unearthly cry from these poor people because 10 or 20 cars were being loaded
[01:03:06] simultaneously.
[01:03:08] The entire freight train was dreadfully long, one could not see all of it.
[01:03:13] They may have been 50 to 60 cars, if not more, and after a car was loaded, the doors were closed
[01:03:20] and nailed shut.
[01:03:23] Once all the cars were sealed, the men of reserve police did battalion 101 quickly departed
[01:03:29] without waiting to see the train pull away.
[01:03:37] These guys did their little part of the job and they're going to walk away now.
[01:03:43] But, yeah.
[01:03:50] Again, it's a nightmare scenario.
[01:03:54] Continuing on shortly before the deportation program resumed in northern security zone,
[01:03:59] reserve police battalion 101 was involved in several more mass shootings.
[01:04:05] So there's a couple of times that they don't get the help that they had before going
[01:04:10] back to the book without the experience to help with the hewis will-off organized the executions
[01:04:16] along the lines of the use of the use of shooting.
[01:04:21] The groups of 20 to 30 Jews, which had been marched out of town at succession to gravel
[01:04:26] pits, were turned over to an equal number of Peters and Eurics commandos.
[01:04:31] Thus, each policeman once again faced the individual Jew he was going to shoot.
[01:04:38] The Jews were not forced to undress, nor was there a collection of valuables.
[01:04:42] There was also no selection for labor.
[01:04:45] All the Jews, regardless of age and sex, were to be shot.
[01:04:52] So in the earlier ones, they were stripping them down and collecting their valuables.
[01:04:56] They're not even doing that.
[01:04:57] I bet they're not doing that because when you do that, you're getting some kind of
[01:05:01] an interaction.
[01:05:03] You're seeing their personal items and they didn't want any of that.
[01:05:06] Just take them out and shoot them.
[01:05:07] The easiest psychological way to do it.
[01:05:11] Back to the book, the policeman and the shooting commandos marched their Jews to the
[01:05:14] crest of one of the mounds of waste material in the area of the gravel pits.
[01:05:19] The victims were lined up facing a six foot drop.
[01:05:23] From a short distance behind the policeman fired on order into the necks of the Jews.
[01:05:28] The bodies tumbled over the edge.
[01:05:31] Following each round, the next group of Jews was brought up to the same spot and thus
[01:05:36] had to look down at the growing pile of corpses of their family and friends before they
[01:05:43] were shot in turn.
[01:05:47] Only after a number of rounds did the shooter's change sites.
[01:06:02] There's some more deportation operations.
[01:06:06] They're back to doing deportations back to the book, but even the most unfettered violence
[01:06:12] could not overcome the shortage of trained cars.
[01:06:15] And when the doors were finally foreshut about 150 Jews, mostly women and children, but
[01:06:19] also some men remained.
[01:06:22] Nade, this is that same lieutenant, sadist.
[01:06:26] Some and drucker and told him to take these Jews to the cemetery.
[01:06:30] At the cemetery entrance, the policeman chased away the eager spectators and waited until
[01:06:35] first sergeant Ostman arrived in a truck with a supply of vodka for the shooters.
[01:06:42] Ostman turned to one of his men who had hit through to avoided shooting and chided him.
[01:06:52] Drink up now, fight for.
[01:06:54] You're in for it this time because the Jewesses must be shot.
[01:06:59] You've gotten yourself out of it so far, but now you must go to it.
[01:07:04] An execution squad of about 20 men was sent into the cemetery.
[01:07:09] The Jews were brought in groups of 20 men first and then women and children.
[01:07:17] They were first to lie down near the cemetery wall and then shop from behind the neck.
[01:07:24] Which policeman fired seven or eight times.
[01:07:30] At the cemetery gate, one Jew springed a drucker with a syringe but was quickly subdued.
[01:07:34] The other Jew sat quietly awaiting their fate even after the shooting began.
[01:07:41] They were quite emaciated and looked half star of the death one guard remembered.
[01:07:54] It's covered in here, not in the detail we should cover it.
[01:08:06] But these Jews that were now getting rounded up, they were already in most of the, well,
[01:08:13] in some of the case in the book, they were already in these ghettos.
[01:08:17] Jewish ghettos, like they'd been forced into these ghettos.
[01:08:21] They were now just living there starving but they're living and then the Germans didn't
[01:08:28] no more Jews.
[01:08:29] They wanted the areas.
[01:08:30] I think the ward was jued and free, it was like free of Jews.
[01:08:33] Now even these people and by the way, there were some of the Germans that complained,
[01:08:39] like hey, those are my labors, you can't come my labors now, we're killing everyone.
[01:08:43] So even again, it's not like this is an enemy with threat.
[01:08:49] These people were now completely subdued living in these, in these, I don't call them ghettos.
[01:08:55] They're like prison ghettos.
[01:08:57] They're living in there.
[01:08:58] They're no threat to anybody but they round them up, take them out, kill them.
[01:09:04] Now one of the interesting points that they bring up in the book and I want to cover
[01:09:07] the whole thing but it's worth mentioning is that this guy Hoffman, one of the, one of
[01:09:12] the captains, he has this strange stomach illness, like he gets upset to his stomach.
[01:09:22] So here we, here we, he misses some of the actions or at least he's not there present
[01:09:30] where the executions are taking place and whatnot and it just painted a picture of the kind
[01:09:35] of leader that he is.
[01:09:37] So going back to the book uniformly, Hoffman's men offered a different perspective, meaning
[01:09:42] it's not just like, you know, he's sick to stomach and blah blah blah.
[01:09:45] By their observation, his alleged bouts of stomach cramps, confining him safely to bed, coincided
[01:09:52] all too consistently with company actions that might involve either unpleasantness or danger.
[01:09:58] It became common for the men to predict upon hearing the night before a pending action
[01:10:04] that the company chief would be bedridden in the morning.
[01:10:08] Hoffman's behavior wrankled his men even more because of two aggravating factors.
[01:10:13] First, he'd always been strict and unapproachable, a typical base officer who liked his white
[01:10:21] collar and gloves, wore his SS and signified on his uniform and demanded considerable
[01:10:26] difference.
[01:10:27] So that's the one thing you heard about the guy.
[01:10:29] His suspense, the worst picture of just such a horrible human being, he loves wearing his
[01:10:37] wrank, he loves being the guy, a base officer.
[01:10:41] Now there's a term for that.
[01:10:44] They have, I think we made up in the, not we, but the US current war fighting soldiers and
[01:10:52] Marines.
[01:10:53] It's a fobbit.
[01:10:55] A fobbit.
[01:10:56] So you get something called a forward operating base overseas and the forwarding on
[01:11:00] operating bases can actually be, you know, pretty nice there.
[01:11:04] They're relatively secure.
[01:11:06] And so the fobbit right is the leader that just wants to stay on the fob.
[01:11:11] Yeah.
[01:11:12] And want to go out.
[01:11:14] So this guy's, but of course the fobbit's are always running around, you know, wanting
[01:11:19] to be respected, demanding, respect, demanding difference.
[01:11:23] So this guy's a fobbit.
[01:11:25] The other thing is, and this is very typical of this kind of wretched human, back to the
[01:11:32] book second, Hoffman tried to compensate for his immobility by intensified supervision of his
[01:11:39] subordinates.
[01:11:40] So he's not around, but he's going to be more of a jerk and impose himself more onto
[01:11:45] the, onto the men.
[01:11:50] Now they're continuing with another ghetto that had to be cleared back to the book by
[01:11:59] October the order was for real.
[01:12:01] Placards announced that all Jews did not go to the get-os would be shot.
[01:12:06] The shooting order was made part of regular company instructions to the men and given repeatedly
[01:12:11] especially before they were sent on patrol.
[01:12:14] No one could be left in any doubt that not a single Jew is to remain alive in the battalion
[01:12:19] security zone.
[01:12:21] In official jargon, the battalion made a forest patrols for suspects.
[01:12:27] As the surviving Jews were to be tracked down and shot like animals, however, the men of
[01:12:33] reserve police battalion 101 of unofficially dubbed this phase of the final solution,
[01:12:39] the Jew hunt.
[01:12:43] The Jew hunt took many forms, most spectacular were two battalion sweeps.
[01:12:52] And here's some George Lefler of third company talking about that.
[01:12:57] What those sweeps were like back to the book, we were told that there were many Jews hiding
[01:13:02] in the forest.
[01:13:03] We therefore searched through the woods in a skirmish line, but we could find nothing,
[01:13:08] because the Jews were obviously well hidden.
[01:13:11] We combed the woods a second time, only then could we discover individual chimney pipes
[01:13:16] sticking out of the earth.
[01:13:19] We discovered that Jews had hidden themselves in underground bunkers here.
[01:13:23] They were hauled out with some resistance and only one bunker, some of the comrades climbed
[01:13:28] down into the bunker and hauled the Jews out.
[01:13:31] The Jews were then shot on the spot.
[01:13:33] The Jews had to lie at face down on the ground and were killed by a neck shot.
[01:13:40] Who is in the firing squad?
[01:13:41] I don't remember.
[01:13:42] I think it was simply a case where the men standing nearby were ordered to shoot them.
[01:13:49] Some 50 Jews were shot, including men and women of all ages, because entire families had
[01:13:54] hidden themselves there.
[01:13:57] The shooting took place quite publicly.
[01:14:00] No cordon was formed at all for a number of poles from parse-ru, were standing directly
[01:14:07] by the shooting site.
[01:14:09] They were then ordered presumably by Hoffman to bury the Jews who had been shot in a
[01:14:14] half-finished bunker.
[01:14:18] So again, you've got some of the Jews who had been consolidated in these getos and now
[01:14:23] there are anyone that's not any Jew that's not the ghetto that they're out hunting them.
[01:14:27] Here's another version of it.
[01:14:28] In cases where the farm yard and the Jewish lodgings could be reached quickly, I drove
[01:14:33] into the farm yard at high speed and the police spring out and immediately rushed to the
[01:14:36] Jewish lodgings.
[01:14:38] And all the Jews present at the time were driven out and shot in the farm yard near a
[01:14:42] haystack, potato pit, or done heap.
[01:14:46] The victims were almost always naked and were shot in the neck while lying on the ground.
[01:14:58] Now even as this was taking place, there's still people that are trying to avoid the
[01:15:05] shooting back to the book, the tactic of keeping one's distance was invoked by Heinrich
[01:15:13] Foigt to explain how he avoided shooting on all the one occasion.
[01:15:20] One always had a certain freedom of movement of a few meters and from experience, I noticed
[01:15:24] very quickly that the platoon leader almost always chose the people standing next to him.
[01:15:30] I thus always attempted to take position as far as possible from the center of events.
[01:15:35] There's likewise sought to avoid shooting by staying in the background.
[01:15:42] So there's still guys that are not, they're trying to do their best not to participate.
[01:15:49] Again, if they do anything to stop it, no.
[01:15:52] But this was a great kind of a wrap on the Jew hunt and what this was like back to the
[01:15:58] book.
[01:15:59] The Jew hunt was not a brief episode.
[01:16:01] It was a tenacious, remorseless ongoing campaign in which the hunters track down and killed
[01:16:08] their prey in direct and personal confrontation.
[01:16:12] It was not a passing phase, but an existential condition of constant readiness and intention
[01:16:18] to kill every last Jew who could be found.
[01:16:29] Now we're going to cover this last massacre that took place and Jews had been sent from
[01:16:44] to a prison camp to be executed and they were rounded up, I think it was a place called
[01:16:48] Lake Leibick.
[01:16:53] They were sent to be executed.
[01:16:54] And the police battalion is now acting as kind of guards and accessories to this to
[01:17:01] make sure that the executions, these mass executions take place, correctly going back
[01:17:07] to the book.
[01:17:08] As the Jews pass between the chain of reserve policemen into the camp, music blared
[01:17:13] from two loudspeaker trucks.
[01:17:16] Despite the attempt to drown out other noise, the sound of steady gunfire could be heard
[01:17:21] from the camp.
[01:17:24] The Jews were taken to the last row of barracks where they undressed.
[01:17:28] Arms raised, hands clasped behind their necks, totally naked.
[01:17:33] They were letting groups from the barracks through a whole cut in the fence to the trenches
[01:17:37] that had been dug behind the camp.
[01:17:41] This route was guarded by men from the reserve police battalion 101.
[01:17:47] Stationed only 10 meters from the graves.
[01:17:49] Line-recobl cult of first company witnessed the killing procedure.
[01:17:55] Quote, from my position, I could now observe how the Jews were driven naked from the barracks
[01:18:00] by other members of our battalion.
[01:18:04] The shooters of the execution commando, who sat on the edge of the graves directly in front
[01:18:09] of me were members of the SD and the SD is like the SS intel intelligence group, the SD.
[01:18:18] Some distance behind each shooter stood several other SD men who constantly kept the magazines
[01:18:24] of the submachine guns filled and handed them to each shooter.
[01:18:29] The number of shooters were assigned to each grave.
[01:18:32] Today I can no longer provide details about the number of graves.
[01:18:37] It is possible that there were many such graves where shooting took place simultaneously.
[01:18:42] I definitely remember that the naked Jews were driven directly into the graves and forced
[01:18:47] to lie down quite precisely on top of those who had been shot before them.
[01:18:53] The shooter then fired off a burst at these prone victims.
[01:18:58] How long the action lasted, I can no longer say with certainty.
[01:19:03] Presumably it lasted the entire day because I remember that I was relieved once from my post.
[01:19:11] I can give no details about the number of victims but there were an awful lot of them.
[01:19:23] It's almost incomprehensible to imagine that you're one of these Jews getting forced,
[01:19:31] you're naked, lay down, go into this pit, lay down on top of those other people that
[01:19:36] were just shot so you can be shot too.
[01:19:40] Other witness, Martin Dettmold.
[01:19:43] Quote, because I was a group leader and could move about more freely, I went once directly
[01:19:48] to the execution site and saw how the newly arriving Jews had to lie down on those already
[01:19:52] shot.
[01:19:54] They were then likewise shot with burst from submachine guns.
[01:19:58] The SD men took care that the Jews were shot in such a way that there were inclines
[01:20:04] in the piles of corpses enabling the newcomers to lie down on the corpses piled as much
[01:20:09] as three meters high.
[01:20:13] The whole business was the most gruesome I have ever seen in my life because I was frequently
[01:20:18] able to see that after a burst of a burst had been fired, the Jews were only wounded
[01:20:25] and those still living were more or less buried alive beneath the corpses of those shot
[01:20:30] later.
[01:20:32] I got the wounded being given so-called mercy shots.
[01:20:39] I remember that from out of the pile of corpses the SS men were cursed by the wounded.
[01:20:56] And that was sort of the final participation of 101 Battalion and here we get to there
[01:21:07] how it kind of wrapped up at the conclusion of the earned fest massacres, the district
[01:21:16] of Lublin was for all practical purposes, Juden free of Jews.
[01:21:22] The murderous participation of Reserve Battalion Reserve Police Battalion 101 in the final
[01:21:27] solution came to an end.
[01:21:30] With a conservative estimate of 6,500 Jews shot during earlier actions like those at Yosafov
[01:21:37] and Lomazzi and 1,000 shot during the Jew hunts and a minimum estimate of 3,000, 500 Jews
[01:21:46] shot at Magnank and Punitwa, the Battalion had participated in the direct shooting deaths
[01:21:53] of at least 38,000 Jews.
[01:22:01] With the death camp deportation of at least 3,000 Jews from my direct in early May 1943,
[01:22:09] the number of Jews they had placed on trains to Lublinca had risen to 45,000.
[01:22:18] For a battalion of less than 500 men, the ultimate body count was at least 83,000
[01:22:26] Jews.
[01:22:41] Unbelievable.
[01:22:46] And here he asks the question back to the book, why did most men in Reserve Police
[01:22:50] Battalion 101 become killers while only in my naughty?
[01:22:54] Of perhaps 10% and certainly no more than 20% did not.
[01:22:59] A number of explanations have been invoked in the past to explain such behavior, wartime
[01:23:05] brutalization, racism, segmentation, and routineization of the task, special selection of
[01:23:14] the perpetrators, careerism, obedience to orders, death threats to authority, ideological
[01:23:21] and indoctrination and conformity.
[01:23:24] These factors are applicable in varying degrees, but none without qualifications.
[01:23:29] They're trying to figure out why these people did what they did.
[01:23:34] And those that's less of all the kind of excuses or reasons I should say of why these men
[01:23:40] behave this way.
[01:23:43] Talks a little bit about overall kind of war crimes here.
[01:23:48] Back to the book, many of the most notorious wartime atrocities.
[01:23:52] The Japanese rampage through Manila, the American slaughter of prisoners and mutilation
[01:23:56] of corpses on many of the Pacific Islands and the massacre at Mely, involved a kind of
[01:24:00] battlefield frenzy.
[01:24:03] Soldiers who are a nerd to violence, numb to the taking of human life, embittered over
[01:24:09] their own casualties and frustrated by the tenacity of an insidious and seemingly inhuman
[01:24:15] enemy, sometimes exploded and at other times grimly resolved to have their revenge at
[01:24:20] first opportunity.
[01:24:22] So that's one type.
[01:24:25] For me, what's that called when a non-premeditated murder?
[01:24:30] Like the guy comes home and his wife's with some other guy and boom, he goes battlefield
[01:24:36] frenzy.
[01:24:38] That's one kind.
[01:24:39] Now we talk about this premeditated.
[01:24:41] Back to the book, other kinds of atrocity, lacking the immediacy of the battlefield frenzy
[01:24:46] and fully expressing official government policy, decidedly weren't standard operating procedures.
[01:24:54] Fire bombing of German Japanese cities, the enslavement of an murderous maltreatment
[01:25:00] of foreign laborers in German camps and factories, or along the CM, Burma Railroad.
[01:25:08] The reprisal shooting of 100 civilians for every German soldier killed by partisan attacking
[01:25:12] UNIguicloislawia or elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
[01:25:15] These were not the spontaneous explosions or cruel revenge of brutalized men, but the
[01:25:20] methodical executed policies of government.
[01:25:27] Both kinds of atrocities occur in the brutalizing context of war, but the men who carry out
[01:25:32] atrocity by policy are in a different state of mind.
[01:25:36] They act not out of frenzy, bitterness, and frustration, but with calculation.
[01:25:43] Clearly the men of reserve police battalion 101 in implementing the systematic Nazi policy
[01:25:48] of exterminating European jury, along in the second category.
[01:25:55] Except for a few, the oldest men who were veterans of World War I and a few NCOs who had
[01:25:59] been transferred from Poland to Poland from Russia, the men of the battalion had not seen
[01:26:03] battle or encountered a deadly enemy.
[01:26:07] Most of them had not fired a shot in anger or even been fired upon, much less lost comrades
[01:26:13] in fighting at their side.
[01:26:16] Thus wartime brutalization through prior combat was not an immediate experience directly
[01:26:22] influencing the policeman's behavior at Yosifov.
[01:26:26] Once the killing began, however, the men became increasingly brutalized.
[01:26:32] As in combat, the horrors of the initial encounter eventually became routine and the killing
[01:26:39] became progressively easier.
[01:26:42] In a sense, in this sense, brutalization was not the cause, but the effect of the men's
[01:26:48] behavior.
[01:26:49] He's saying, look, like what you said, these guys are finding an enemy.
[01:26:53] They hadn't lost their buddy.
[01:26:54] They're not avenging their buddy.
[01:26:57] They've got killed next to him.
[01:26:58] They're blown up by an IED and now they're going to take it out on this group that they
[01:27:02] capture.
[01:27:03] It's not like that.
[01:27:08] Back to the book, as John Dauer has observed, the dehumanization of the other, contributed
[01:27:12] to emagerably to the psychological distancing that facilitated killing.
[01:27:18] Distancing, not frenzy and brutalization is one of the keys to the behavior of the reserve
[01:27:23] of the police battalion 101, war and negative racial stereotyping were to mutually reinforcing
[01:27:30] factors in this distancing.
[01:27:32] So in order to kill these people, you got to distance yourself from them.
[01:27:36] You can't see them as human.
[01:27:37] You can't see them as people.
[01:27:41] Many scholars of the Holocaust, especially Raoul Hilberg, have emphasized the bureaucratic and
[01:27:47] administrative aspects of the destruction process.
[01:27:51] This is very interesting.
[01:27:53] This approach emphasizes the degree to which modern bureaucratic life fosters a functional
[01:27:58] and physical distancing in the same way that war and negative racial stereotyping promote
[01:28:03] a psychological distancing between perpetrator and victim.
[01:28:06] So you form this bureaucratic machine that you're only a little piece of it.
[01:28:13] You know, all you're doing is collecting people.
[01:28:15] All you're doing is putting them in change.
[01:28:16] You're not killing anybody.
[01:28:17] Yeah.
[01:28:18] You're all you're doing is rounding them up.
[01:28:19] All you're doing is guarding them as they're getting pushed down to the into the graves.
[01:28:22] That's not you.
[01:28:23] Yeah.
[01:28:24] It's a big bureaucratic machine.
[01:28:25] You're not really just a little piece of it.
[01:28:29] Back to the book.
[01:28:30] Indeed, many of the perpetrators of the Holocaust were so called desicmergers, whose role in
[01:28:34] the mass extermination was greatly facilitated by the bureaucratic nature of their participation.
[01:28:39] Their jobs frequently consist of tiny steps in the overall killing process and they perform
[01:28:45] them in routine manner, never seeing the victims.
[01:28:48] Their actions affected.
[01:28:51] Regmented, routineized, and depersonalized, the job of the bureaucratic, the bureaucratic
[01:28:58] or specialist, whether it involved confiscating property, scheduling trains, drafting legislation,
[01:29:04] sending telegrams or compiling lists.
[01:29:07] Lists could be performed without confronting them reality of mass murder.
[01:29:14] Such a luxury, of course, was not enjoyed by the men of reserve police, but I in 101,
[01:29:18] who were quite literally saturated in the blood of victim shot at point blank range.
[01:29:23] No one confronted the reality of mass murder more directly than the men in the woods of
[01:29:27] Yosifov.
[01:29:29] Segmentation and routineization, the depersonalizing aspects of the bureaucratic, of the bureaucratic
[01:29:37] caused killing, cannot explain the battalions initial behavior there.
[01:29:43] So again, he's saying, look, that makes sense.
[01:29:46] He turned us into a big bureaucratic thing, but that's not what happened here with these
[01:29:49] guys.
[01:29:51] The facilitating psychological effect of a division of labor for the killing process was
[01:29:56] not totally negligible, however.
[01:29:58] So then he talks about the fact that they did make those adjustments and take the killing
[01:30:04] out of their hands somewhat.
[01:30:08] And that did make it easier for them.
[01:30:10] Now he talks about, you know, one of the things that he mentioned early on on why this
[01:30:13] happening talks about the special selection of the right people.
[01:30:20] Well, that doesn't really hold true either because here we go.
[01:30:22] Back to the book, the case for special selection of officers is even more difficult to make.
[01:30:26] By SS standards, major trap was a patriotic German, but traditionally an overly sentimental.
[01:30:33] What and not, Nazi Germany was scornfully considered both weak and reactionary.
[01:30:40] So you can't say it was the selection of people and we already talked about all the different
[01:30:44] types of normal people that were doing this.
[01:30:47] They didn't pull some truck driver in Hamburg, I'll say that's 38 years old and say this
[01:30:52] guy's going to be the perfect no big thing.
[01:30:54] They didn't do that.
[01:30:57] Back to the book, reserve police battalion was not sent to Lublin to murder Jews because
[01:31:02] it was composed of men specifically selected or deemed particularly suited for the task.
[01:31:08] On the contrary, the battalion was the drags of the manpower pool available at that stage
[01:31:12] of war.
[01:31:14] It was employed to kill Jews because it was the only kind of unit available for such
[01:31:17] behind the line duties.
[01:31:21] Many studies of Nazi killers suggested a different kind of selection, namely self-selection
[01:31:25] to the party and the SS by unusually violence prone people.
[01:31:33] Shortly after the war, Theodore Edorno and many others and others developed the
[01:31:37] notion that there's an authoritarian personality.
[01:31:42] So they started looking at the, there's certain people that have that are susceptible
[01:31:50] to having this type of personality.
[01:31:53] They made up something called the F scale, which is like your propensity to have a authoritarian
[01:32:00] personality.
[01:32:01] Here's some of the ingredients there.
[01:32:06] The book rigid inherent to conventional values, submissiveness to authoritarian, to authority
[01:32:12] figures, aggressiveness toward outdroops, opposition to introspection, reflection and creativity,
[01:32:19] a tendency to superstition and stereotyping, preoccupation with power and toughness, destructiveness
[01:32:26] and cynicism.
[01:32:29] So these are the kind of things that they're saying that these types of personalities
[01:32:33] would become Nazis because that's the type of personality they have.
[01:32:40] There's another kind of kind of to make this as simple as possible, a guy named Zigmunt
[01:32:45] Balman has summed up the approach as follows.
[01:32:49] Naziism was cruel because Nazis were cruel and the Nazis were cruel because cruel people
[01:32:54] tend to become Nazis.
[01:32:56] Again, these are theories.
[01:32:59] I don't think you can apply that to a truck driver from Hamburg that got drafted.
[01:33:05] They didn't even self-select for they got drafted.
[01:33:07] They got told, okay, you need to be in the army here.
[01:33:11] Yeah, in the police, but it's not necessarily, you know, a person being a truck driver
[01:33:20] is like, you know, this exclusionary occupation.
[01:33:24] It's more like just because they're a truck driver.
[01:33:27] It just doesn't mean anything.
[01:33:28] It's like that's not the fact that the truck driver is something.
[01:33:31] Anything, when they talked about all these people from Hamburg, anything that they talked
[01:33:34] about, none of those, it's not like we got a bunch of guys that worked at a slaughterhouse.
[01:33:42] Yeah, yeah.
[01:33:43] Yeah, we're going to be a crude all these people from a slaughterhouse.
[01:33:45] No, we didn't recruit hunters.
[01:33:47] We didn't, they didn't recruit football players because they're aggressive.
[01:33:52] No, it was just random, any job.
[01:33:54] And they showed up there.
[01:33:56] So basically what I'm getting out of this is you saying, like, no, it's like, you can't
[01:34:00] really say it's that either, right?
[01:34:02] Because it's just a waiter and a salesperson.
[01:34:05] But at the same time, the guy who's a waiter could have these other qualities, you know,
[01:34:09] like how you're talking about.
[01:34:10] Yeah, but you take 500 people from Hamburg between the ages of 35 and 40.
[01:34:14] You're not going to find that it's like all these guys had those kind of fascist qualities
[01:34:19] about them, right?
[01:34:20] Not happening.
[01:34:21] Yeah, man.
[01:34:22] It's good.
[01:34:23] Some people become, this is Eric, or sorry, Irvin's job accepts the notion that some
[01:34:33] people become perpetrators as a result of their personality, they are self-selected.
[01:34:39] And he says that under particular circumstances, most people have a capacity for extreme
[01:34:45] violence and the destruction of human life.
[01:34:47] It's an interesting one.
[01:34:51] Under certain circumstances, everyone has a prevents you for violence.
[01:34:56] I'm sure there's people that would argue that in all different directions.
[01:34:59] But you know, you take a middle-aged woman that's never been in a fist fight before and
[01:35:06] you have somebody attack her child that's going to kill or harm their child.
[01:35:10] I think you can see a prevents you for violence and from a lot of them.
[01:35:14] Yeah.
[01:35:15] Maybe even of, you know, what, 99%.
[01:35:18] Sure.
[01:35:19] I'm going to say 99%.
[01:35:21] I'll go with that, do you?
[01:35:23] Yeah.
[01:35:24] 99%.
[01:35:25] If you're, if it's a middle-aged woman who has someone that's about to severely hurt or kill
[01:35:31] their child, and they're ready to stop it as with a pistol.
[01:35:35] Right.
[01:35:36] My assessment is we're going to 99%.
[01:35:39] Yeah.
[01:35:40] That perpetrator's getting killed.
[01:35:43] Yeah.
[01:35:44] With specific effort towards the violent part of it.
[01:35:52] You know, I'm not saying on a movie necessarily, but you know, that whole thing.
[01:35:58] Well, let's say I imagine a scenario like that where the lady's going to shoot this guy
[01:36:02] because the guy's attacking the kid is on the thing.
[01:36:05] It won't be like, oh, let me do the bare minimum force, you know, to eliminate the threat.
[01:36:11] She's probably going to be kind of shows over word killing that guy.
[01:36:15] Get a kill in the extra.
[01:36:17] Yeah, yeah, because that's kind of the violence coming out of someone.
[01:36:20] It's one thing to do because I'm scared.
[01:36:22] Oh my gosh, get away from me.
[01:36:23] Kind of thing.
[01:36:24] That's not violence.
[01:36:25] Yeah.
[01:36:26] So, that's really the question when you consider a middle-aged girl, you know, having
[01:36:31] a friend to be provided.
[01:36:32] I don't think she's going to do extra.
[01:36:34] I think she's going to kill him and go grab her kid and make sure he can safe.
[01:36:37] Right.
[01:36:38] This extra level, you know, desecration of the body or anything like that.
[01:36:43] Right.
[01:36:44] I'm going to make my kid safe.
[01:36:46] Yeah, so you're saying the propensity for violence in that case is just the mere act
[01:36:51] of killing the guy.
[01:36:52] Yeah.
[01:36:53] Well, yeah, that's it.
[01:36:54] Yeah.
[01:36:55] But you know, like, I'm thinking of a movie for whatever reason.
[01:37:01] Because that's all that's all you're bringing this filled with.
[01:37:04] But you know, television in general.
[01:37:07] But, you know, the girl, she's like scared.
[01:37:10] It's all done out of fear, you know?
[01:37:11] And I'm sure it's almost like the violence has just happened.
[01:37:14] It's not her propensity for violence, especially.
[01:37:16] But it's just the violence.
[01:37:17] Yeah, but I'm just saying, if you set up an experiment.
[01:37:19] Yes.
[01:37:20] Where you took a middle-aged group of women.
[01:37:22] Yeah.
[01:37:23] And they had children.
[01:37:24] Yeah, like when you put them in a scenario where, you know, was either the, either the
[01:37:29] kid dies or they killed the perpetrator.
[01:37:31] Right.
[01:37:32] You know, not like a, hey, I might be able to bathe him out of it.
[01:37:34] No, the, the, the acts is in the air.
[01:37:37] It's going to be swung down on the kid.
[01:37:39] Right, right.
[01:37:40] You have to press this button to kill that guy.
[01:37:42] Yeah, we're violent.
[01:37:43] The choice.
[01:37:44] Violence is my choice.
[01:37:45] Yeah.
[01:37:46] I think the propensity is going to be 99.
[01:37:47] Yeah.
[01:37:48] Yeah.
[01:37:49] I'm going to go to your higher.
[01:37:51] Okay.
[01:37:52] So this, then he gets into some of these real famous experiments, kind of sociological experiments.
[01:38:00] One of them is this in Bartos, Stanford prison experiment.
[01:38:04] Yeah.
[01:38:05] Everyone's heard of that where they basically take people and divide them up.
[01:38:09] And just randomly.
[01:38:10] And actually, I didn't know this because I never did any deep research on the study.
[01:38:14] But they, they kind of do a pre-screening to make sure that there's no extreme personalities.
[01:38:21] Everyone, everyone, I was like, I mean, however you could, you could frame the world
[01:38:24] normal.
[01:38:25] The people that participate in the experiment are just like normal people.
[01:38:28] They didn't have any extreme personalities.
[01:38:30] Well, those kind of semi normal people, they put them in that prison experiment and
[01:38:36] sure enough, some people were made guards, some people were made prisoners.
[01:38:40] And they had to get him to do certain things.
[01:38:42] And there's a certain number.
[01:38:43] I mean, didn't take long for the guards.
[01:38:45] I think it took six days, some of the guards turned sadistic evil.
[01:38:49] Right.
[01:38:50] And here we go back to the book.
[01:38:53] Most dramatic and distressing to us was the observation of the ease with which sadistic
[01:38:57] behavior could be elicited in individuals who were not sadistic types.
[01:39:03] The prison situation alone, Zimbardo concluded, was a sufficient condition to produce
[01:39:09] abherent anti-social behavior.
[01:39:12] From the guards, from the guards.
[01:39:15] So this is pretty scary.
[01:39:17] That another fact here pointed out about that only two, IE less than 20% emerged as good guards
[01:39:25] who did not punish prisoners even as they hadn't even did for small favor from.
[01:39:29] So those numbers are pretty in line with this really small percentage of people that
[01:39:33] just, they're just good people.
[01:39:35] Right.
[01:39:36] It's only 10 to 20% of actual good people.
[01:39:39] How's that make you feel about the human race?
[01:39:41] Not real good.
[01:39:42] Yeah.
[01:39:43] Not real good.
[01:39:46] All right.
[01:39:48] Another thing put out here back to the book among the perpetrators, of course, orders
[01:39:54] have traditionally been most frequently cited explanation for their own behavior.
[01:40:00] So remember orders or orders, orders were orders and no one in such a political climate
[01:40:04] could be expected disobey them, they insisted.
[01:40:08] This is the guards.
[01:40:09] I mean, sorry, this is the police to battalion.
[01:40:11] Saying, look, we're getting ordered to do this stuff.
[01:40:12] We're just following orders.
[01:40:13] We hear that all the time.
[01:40:16] Disobedience surely meant the concentration camp, if not immediate execution, possibly
[01:40:22] for their families as well.
[01:40:24] So they're saying, look, if we would end up in the concentration camps ourselves, this
[01:40:27] happened.
[01:40:28] Now, he points this out.
[01:40:30] Back to the book, there is a general problem with this explanation.
[01:40:33] However, quite simply in the past 45 years, no defense attorney or defendant in any of the
[01:40:39] hundreds of postwar trials has been able to document a single case in which refusal to obey
[01:40:45] an order to kill on arm civilians resulted in the allegedly inevitable dire punishment.
[01:40:52] So there's no precedence for that.
[01:40:54] Now, I don't think that these guys out there in the battalion are sitting there thinking
[01:41:02] about this with a legal perspective.
[01:41:05] Well, actually, there's no precedent for punishment being carried out on people that have
[01:41:09] been on.
[01:41:10] I think that's a stretch.
[01:41:11] I think that's a stretch.
[01:41:12] Well, when you're talking about maybe someone contemplating these guys that were saying,
[01:41:18] I couldn't refuse the orders because I would get punished.
[01:41:21] And he's saying that there's no precedence that you actually will get this severe
[01:41:27] punishment.
[01:41:28] But how is it, you know, when someone else is feeling going to know that that's a, that's
[01:41:33] a precedent.
[01:41:34] You don't, you just think, I don't want to get in trouble.
[01:41:36] Yeah, you're not thinking about the time you remember the guy that you heard of getting
[01:41:41] killed.
[01:41:42] Yeah, you're not thinking about that.
[01:41:43] You're thinking about you.
[01:41:44] You're not even more so you're not thinking about the fact that you've never heard
[01:41:47] of that before.
[01:41:48] Yeah, exactly.
[01:41:49] Yeah, yeah.
[01:41:50] All right.
[01:41:51] Now, so we're talking about obedience of orders.
[01:41:53] And here we go back to the book.
[01:41:54] A few obedience to orders out of fear of dire punishment is not a valid explanation.
[01:41:59] What about obedience to authority in the more general sense used by Stanley Millgram,
[01:42:06] difference simply as a product of socialization and evolution, a deeply ingrained behavior
[01:42:12] tendency to comply with the directives of those positioned hierarchically above them.
[01:42:19] Once of the point of performing repugnant actions in violation of universally accepted moral
[01:42:26] norms.
[01:42:27] So you've heard of the Millgram experiments.
[01:42:29] No.
[01:42:30] No, these are kind of like the Stanford prison, pretty famous.
[01:42:34] And what he did was he set up these experiments where he had, you couldn't see these actors
[01:42:40] were behind a wall.
[01:42:42] But they were getting asked questions.
[01:42:44] And if they answered the question wrong, they would get a little electric shock.
[01:42:49] That was done by the person that was being experimented on.
[01:42:53] So you know, I would be, they'd say, okay, Jocco, you got this guy.
[01:42:56] His name is Echo, he's over there going to ask him a question.
[01:42:58] If he gets it wrong, get him with this shock.
[01:43:01] I can't see you, but I can hear you.
[01:43:04] So when I shock you, and every question that you get wrong, I have to escalate the level
[01:43:10] of shock.
[01:43:11] So it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse.
[01:43:12] And your reaction is more and more horrific as these things escalate.
[01:43:16] You're the guy, the experiment is not on me.
[01:43:19] No, you're just an actor.
[01:43:20] There's no actual shock.
[01:43:21] Okay, got you.
[01:43:22] And you're actually going through a series of complaints.
[01:43:27] And I'll read this here.
[01:43:30] There was an escalating series of fake electric shocks upon a vector of victim who responded
[01:43:35] with carefully programmed voice feedback and escalating series of complaints.
[01:43:39] Rise of pain, call for help, and finally, fake full silence.
[01:43:45] In the standard voice feedback experiment, two thirds of pilgrims' subjects were obedient
[01:43:51] to the point of inflicting extreme pain.
[01:43:56] Several variations on the experiment produced significantly different results.
[01:43:59] If the actor slash victim was shielded so that the subject could hear and see no response
[01:44:05] obedience was much greater.
[01:44:07] So if I couldn't hear you and I just knew that I was shocking the hell out of you,
[01:44:11] I was good with it.
[01:44:12] If the subject had both visual and voice feedback, compliance fell to the, compliance
[01:44:18] to the extreme fell to 40%.
[01:44:20] So down from 66% to 40%.
[01:44:23] If the subject had to touch the actor slash victim physically by forcing his hand onto an electric
[01:44:29] plate to deliver the shocks, obedience dropped to 30%.
[01:44:34] Now this is this is fascinating, if a non-affordy figure gave orders obedience was nil.
[01:44:42] So if some guy was like, hey, you know, I'm Bill, I'm running the experiment, hey,
[01:44:48] shock this guy, if the guy was no authority, they got no, they got no, none, no, it's
[01:44:54] that shows you.
[01:44:55] And that's from a leadership perspective, that's very important to understand.
[01:44:58] It's important to understand how much influence you have when you're in a leadership
[01:45:01] position.
[01:45:02] This all time, when I ran into in the SEAL teams, when a guy doesn't recognize the
[01:45:08] power of his rank.
[01:45:10] And he does recognize that just by wearing his rank, when he says something, people kind
[01:45:14] of like going to do it, they got, well, they want to do it.
[01:45:20] So then going back to the book here, if the naive subject performed a subsidiary or accessory
[01:45:28] task, but did not personally inflict the electric shocks, obedience was nearly total.
[01:45:34] So that goes down to the division of labor again.
[01:45:36] If it was just me saying, okay, ask them a question, you have to shock them again.
[01:45:39] And some other guy was shockin' you, I'd go straight to 100.
[01:45:44] Straight to 100.
[01:45:46] In contrast, if the subject or peer was part of an, if the subject was part of an actor
[01:45:50] peer group that staged carefully planned refusal to continue to fall into directions of the
[01:45:55] authority figure, the vast majority of subjects 90% joined their peer group and resist
[01:46:02] and desist as well.
[01:46:03] So that's the tipping point thing.
[01:46:05] If there was other, so if it was three of us that were conducting the experiment on you
[01:46:09] and the other, and I was the, the naive guy that doesn't know what's going on, I'm the one
[01:46:14] that they were actually doing the experiment on.
[01:46:18] And there's two guys, two actors that are in the room with me, and they're going to
[01:46:21] be like, hey man, we shouldn't be doing this.
[01:46:22] And the other guy goes, yeah man, that looks like it's really hurting.
[01:46:24] We should stop this.
[01:46:25] 90% of the time, I go, yeah, you guys are right.
[01:46:30] Psychology, group psychology.
[01:46:32] If the subject was given complete discretion as to the level of lecture chalk to administer,
[01:46:36] all but a few sedists consistently delivered a minimal shock.
[01:46:41] When not under director, Vanillence of the scientist, many of the subjects cheated by giving
[01:46:46] lower shocks than prescribed, even though they were unable to confront authority and abandon
[01:46:52] the experiment.
[01:46:53] They give lower shocks if they wouldn't walk away from it.
[01:46:55] They wouldn't just say, I'm not going to do this.
[01:46:57] Yeah.
[01:46:58] It took it to everyone's re, really, you know what it is?
[01:47:02] We're all just on the edge, man.
[01:47:04] In a way.
[01:47:05] Yeah.
[01:47:06] And we kind of need each other in that way too.
[01:47:08] Well, it's, it's again, this is, you know, this is about leadership.
[01:47:11] It's amazing how influential, or how influential people are.
[01:47:17] They're so ready for influencers, so ready to be told like, hey man, we shouldn't be
[01:47:21] doing this.
[01:47:22] It's the same thing we saw with the podcast on the Meal Eye Masker.
[01:47:25] All it took was one officer saying stop killing.
[01:47:27] And everyone, okay, stop killing.
[01:47:29] Everyone just, they just need to get nudged in that direction.
[01:47:32] And by the way, they had already been nudged in the other direction, which is kill everyone.
[01:47:35] They said, okay, go with the other one.
[01:47:36] And that's what I mean, but I don't mean on the edge of like sanding nothing.
[01:47:39] I mean, on the fence.
[01:47:40] Yeah, on the fence.
[01:47:41] That's why leadership is so important because you're walking around with people all over
[01:47:44] the world and whatever position you're in, regardless if it's in a work environment,
[01:47:48] it's in a social environment, if it's with your friend, your peer group, you have so much
[01:47:52] power over people just by being a leader.
[01:47:55] And by using that influence to work people one way or the other.
[01:47:59] Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:48:01] Yeah, it is crazy.
[01:48:05] Going back to the book to what were the vast majority of traps men responding to when
[01:48:10] they did not step out?
[01:48:13] Was it the authority as represented by either trap or his superiors, where they responding
[01:48:18] to trap not primarily as an authority figure, but as an individual, a popular and beloved
[01:48:23] officer who they assumed, who they would not leave in the lurch.
[01:48:28] What about other factors?
[01:48:30] Milgram himself notes that far, that people far more frequently invoke authority than conformity
[01:48:38] to explain their behavior.
[01:48:40] For only the former seems to absolve them of personal responsibility.
[01:48:46] He quotes here, subjects denied conformity and embrace obedience as the explanation of their
[01:48:52] actions.
[01:48:53] So people don't like to say everyone else is doing it.
[01:48:55] People don't like to say that because that means I'm responsible for it.
[01:48:59] People like to take ownership of things.
[01:49:01] I have a book called Extreme Ownership.
[01:49:04] People don't like to take ownership of things.
[01:49:06] Instead they want to say, as soon as I blame something on my boss and this is one of
[01:49:09] the big things in extreme ownership leading up the chain of command, it's so easy to blame
[01:49:13] your boss.
[01:49:14] Because how can I control my boss?
[01:49:16] I was following orders.
[01:49:17] I was following orders, boss.
[01:49:18] What do we do?
[01:49:19] That's why we failed to mission.
[01:49:20] I was told to do this.
[01:49:21] Either you can give me the right gear.
[01:49:22] That's what we hear this all the time.
[01:49:24] And Milgram says it too.
[01:49:26] No one wants to say, hey, you know what?
[01:49:27] I decided I was just going to do whatever one else was doing.
[01:49:30] That's my decision.
[01:49:31] Instead they put that decision on the other guy on the boss man.
[01:49:35] Another exploration here, back to the book, Direct Proximity to the horror of killing
[01:49:43] significantly increased the number of men who would no longer comply on the other hand
[01:49:49] with the division of labor and removal of the killing process to the death camps, the
[01:49:53] men felt scarcely any responsibility for their actions.
[01:49:57] Same thing, Milgram figured out.
[01:49:58] I got someone else that's pressing the button over there that's shocking you.
[01:50:01] I'm good with it.
[01:50:02] Keep rolling.
[01:50:05] Now one thing that Milgram kind of talks about is his kind of indoctrination or what kind
[01:50:13] of ideological justification did he give to his people?
[01:50:17] That's really just pre-existing in Milgram's experiences or just kind of normal people.
[01:50:21] So what about with the Nazis?
[01:50:23] And what kind of indoctrination did they get brainwashed?
[01:50:26] Right?
[01:50:28] We've talked about this a little bit already, but back to the book, all order police
[01:50:32] battalions were to be strengthened in character and ideology.
[01:50:37] One topic for the first week, they went through like a school in education, ideological
[01:50:40] education, one topic for the first week was race as the basis of our world view, followed
[01:50:46] by the second week, maintaining the purity of blood.
[01:50:52] So there you go.
[01:50:54] These guys are being indoctrinated, but the reason that argument doesn't really hold
[01:51:00] much weight is because of the way the who the people were and back to the book.
[01:51:05] Whatever the merits of such an argument, it clearly does not hold for the predominantly
[01:51:09] middle-aged men of reserve, police battalion 101.
[01:51:13] They were educated and spent their formative years in the pre-1933 period.
[01:51:19] Many came from a social malu that was relatively unreceptive to national socialism.
[01:51:25] They were, they knew perfectly well the moral norms of German society before the Nazis.
[01:51:29] So you can't really blame it on them being brainwashed.
[01:51:36] So here's how Browning wraps up this book.
[01:51:44] I'm going to close it out.
[01:51:47] The behavior of any human being is of course a very complex phenomenon and the historian
[01:51:53] who attempts to explain it is indulging in a certain arrogance.
[01:51:59] When nearly 500 men are involved to undertake any general explanation of their collective behavior
[01:52:07] is even more hazardous.
[01:52:10] What then is one to conclude?
[01:52:13] Most of all one comes away from the story of reserve police battalion 101 with a great
[01:52:20] unease.
[01:52:22] This story of ordinary men is not the story of all men.
[01:52:26] The reserve policemen faced choices and most of them committed terrible deeds.
[01:52:34] But those who killed cannot be absolved by the notion that anyone in the same situation
[01:52:39] would have done as they did for even among them some refused to kill and others stopped
[01:52:45] killing.
[01:52:48] Human responsibility is ultimately an individual matter.
[01:52:54] At the same time, however, the collective behavior of reserve police battalion 101 has
[01:53:00] deeply disturbing implications.
[01:53:04] There are many societies afflicted by traditions of racism and caught in the siege mentality
[01:53:13] of war or threat of war.
[01:53:17] Everywhere, society conditions people to respect and defer to authority and indeed could
[01:53:24] scarcely function otherwise.
[01:53:27] Everywhere people seek career advancement.
[01:53:32] In every modern society the complexity of life and the resulting bureaucratization and specialization
[01:53:40] attenuate the sense of personal responsibility of those implementing official policy.
[01:53:49] With in virtually every social collective, the peer group exerts tremendous pressures on
[01:53:55] behavior and sets moral norms.
[01:54:02] If the men of reserve police battalion 101 could become killers under such circumstances,
[01:54:11] what group of men cannot.
[01:54:22] There you have it and I think those are some extremely important warnings that are
[01:54:32] laid out there.
[01:54:34] Obviously, the first one we have to be aware of traditions of racism and the threat of war.
[01:54:44] I think those are pretty obvious and stand out pretty clearly.
[01:54:49] I think the other ones are a little bit trickier.
[01:54:54] I think we've got to watch out the fact that we are conditioned to respect and defer to authority.
[01:55:03] I said to that no.
[01:55:05] I actually, when I grew up, I was a rebellious kid and I listened to rebellious music and I
[01:55:16] was a rebellious kid.
[01:55:18] I talk about that.
[01:55:19] And I think that was very beneficial for me in my military career.
[01:55:26] And I explained that whole time that I asked questions.
[01:55:30] If I don't believe in something, I'm going to ask questions.
[01:55:31] And by the way, I don't, I want the people that work for me or with me.
[01:55:37] I want them to ask questions too.
[01:55:39] I don't want to be surrounded by Yesmen.
[01:55:41] And I'm not going to be Yesmen.
[01:55:42] Never was.
[01:55:43] I don't mean, let me caveat that.
[01:55:47] I never was.
[01:55:50] You've got to be a Yesman in order to get the inner circle where you can actually have influence.
[01:55:54] So have I played that game before?
[01:55:56] Yes I have.
[01:55:57] Yeah boss, that sounds like good plan.
[01:55:59] Yeah boss, yeah.
[01:56:00] It sounds good plan.
[01:56:01] Oh, I trust chocolate.
[01:56:02] He agrees with me all the time.
[01:56:03] Hey boss, you're going off the rails over here.
[01:56:05] He's stopped it.
[01:56:06] Oh, I'm going to listen to chocolate because he listens to me.
[01:56:08] So have I played that game before?
[01:56:10] Yes, of course I have.
[01:56:12] So we need to be careful that we don't submit always to authority.
[01:56:18] It's a hard thing to raise your kids with too, right?
[01:56:21] Because you want your kids to submit to your authority, but you don't want them to.
[01:56:26] I have to always remind myself when they rebel against me.
[01:56:29] I have to say to myself, good.
[01:56:33] Because I want them to ask questions.
[01:56:34] I want them to question authority.
[01:56:36] I don't want them to just obey.
[01:56:37] Right.
[01:56:38] And that freaks people out.
[01:56:40] It freaks people out when you say, you know, I'll go and work with a company and I'll
[01:56:44] be saying like, no, I want your people.
[01:56:45] You want your people to ask questions.
[01:56:48] If you want to just order them around and they're just going to obey you, first of all,
[01:56:53] I'm not going to help you there because that's not a system that's functional.
[01:56:57] It'll be functional for a week.
[01:56:58] It'll be functional for two weeks.
[01:57:00] But eventually you'll have people that don't understand why they're doing what they're
[01:57:03] doing.
[01:57:04] They don't put their effort to it.
[01:57:05] They can't make decisions on their own and you end up with a bad team.
[01:57:07] Yeah.
[01:57:08] We don't want that kind of authoritarian leadership anywhere.
[01:57:13] And certainly not anywhere.
[01:57:16] Again, it does it work for five minutes.
[01:57:18] Does it work for a week?
[01:57:19] Yeah.
[01:57:20] Sometimes needed because people got to get something done right now.
[01:57:24] Yeah.
[01:57:25] But you better fall that up with some non-authoritarian leadership with explaining and building
[01:57:29] relationships with people.
[01:57:31] Yeah.
[01:57:32] That explanation thing they just talked about all the time.
[01:57:35] We're explaining why.
[01:57:36] Yeah.
[01:57:37] Explain why I'm telling you to do this.
[01:57:38] It's important because of this, the XYZ.
[01:57:40] Man, and I'm speaking from a perspective of being a parent.
[01:57:45] How effective that is.
[01:57:47] You just say, this is why you're doing this.
[01:57:49] That's effective.
[01:57:50] How old is your daughter now?
[01:57:51] Yeah.
[01:57:52] It's already effective for the four-year-old.
[01:57:54] Yeah.
[01:57:55] And even in the past few years, you can't always rationalize it for your old.
[01:57:57] Sometimes they just want that cookie.
[01:57:59] Yeah.
[01:58:00] And there's no why about it.
[01:58:01] It was strangely with the, we have situation right now where her cousin is in.
[01:58:06] And you know, he put in a nutshell, his diet isn't quite as-
[01:58:13] She's not on the, he's not on the pro-proper.
[01:58:14] He's not on the pro-proper.
[01:58:15] I'm like, how my daughter is in the pro-program.
[01:58:18] But you know, he'll eat junk food or whatever, right?
[01:58:22] And it's kind of part of the experience I understand where, you know, hey, cousin's in
[01:58:26] from how to tell and it's a little bit more festive than the news and it's, yeah.
[01:58:29] So after a while, I started realizing like, cousin showed up at my house.
[01:58:33] You get on the pro-program.
[01:58:35] It should be like that.
[01:58:37] So after a while, I was like, hey, you know, we, there's too many treats going on these days.
[01:58:43] You know, I have to have a little bit.
[01:58:45] I have to have a little bit.
[01:58:47] And so when I told my daughter, I was like, no, you know, we're not going to do this.
[01:58:51] And I explained why.
[01:58:52] You could tell she didn't, she wasn't happy with it, but she totally understood four
[01:58:56] years old where, and I didn't in a way where it wasn't like-
[01:59:00] Is you reference where the warrior get away with it?
[01:59:03] Yeah, always too. She was wearing that shirt to school today too, by the way.
[01:59:06] Well, then that's it.
[01:59:07] Coincidentally, he went right there using one of you.
[01:59:10] But it was, it, what, I didn't scare her.
[01:59:13] You know, I didn't, I wasn't like, oh, then you're going to be a loser or something.
[01:59:17] You know, something like that.
[01:59:18] Are you my kids to say to each other?
[01:59:19] Oh, you might as well just go ahead and volunteer for type two diabetes.
[01:59:23] Yeah, they get crazy.
[01:59:24] I know, I know, I know, I know from-
[01:59:26] Yeah, I know exactly where they went there.
[01:59:29] But it was just the kind, you know, like where my older kids do it to my younger daughter.
[01:59:33] Yeah, yeah.
[01:59:34] You're going to get type two diabetes.
[01:59:35] The peer pressure.
[01:59:36] She's all like, she thinks she's going to get it today.
[01:59:39] Yeah, that's messed up.
[01:59:40] You know, it is messed up.
[01:59:42] Effective, we're ineffective, though.
[01:59:43] Right.
[01:59:44] That's your thing.
[01:59:45] Sure.
[01:59:46] No, but it, you know, the point being it is, it is effective.
[01:59:49] It's, I mean, get, you know, like how you say too, you don't have to be a dick about it.
[01:59:53] It's not a scolding.
[01:59:54] It's not nothing like that.
[01:59:56] It's a full-on-experting.
[01:59:57] She actually understood-
[01:59:58] Actually contrary to that, it's the other end of the spectrum.
[02:00:01] Yeah.
[02:00:02] I'm talking to you is because I care about you so much that I want you to be healthy.
[02:00:07] Yeah.
[02:00:08] That's the one that reason I'm talking to you.
[02:00:10] Yeah, we can't.
[02:00:11] You'd like your parents to say that.
[02:00:12] Say those exact words.
[02:00:13] I do this because I care about you.
[02:00:14] Meanwhile, they're yelling at you.
[02:00:15] Yeah, it's the same.
[02:00:16] Thank you.
[02:00:17] And employers do it.
[02:00:18] Two bosses do that, too.
[02:00:19] Don't just bring it over.
[02:00:20] Yeah, no, the first thing they do is they want to jump down someone throat.
[02:00:23] Yeah.
[02:00:24] And then everyone's reactions the same to that.
[02:00:25] Yeah.
[02:00:26] And one likes it.
[02:00:27] No one likes it.
[02:00:28] Whereas if you take a different approach and you say, hey, echo.
[02:00:32] You don't want him talking to you right now.
[02:00:33] It's not because I'm mad at you.
[02:00:35] It's because I'm actually I see nothing but potential with you.
[02:00:38] Yeah.
[02:00:39] That's what I see.
[02:00:40] And when I see that you're not making, you're not making many videos.
[02:00:44] It's not because I'm thinking myself, oh, I want more videos.
[02:00:48] The reason I'm thinking this is because I actually see how much potential you have.
[02:00:52] And you could really do some powerful stuff and have some huge influence.
[02:00:56] But you're just all right, Jaco.
[02:00:59] As opposed to you better make more videos or else I'm going to have my kid do it.
[02:01:06] Will you be lazy, bro?
[02:01:08] Exactly.
[02:01:09] Then you'd be like, fine, I think I could do that.
[02:01:10] We'll be as good as my kids.
[02:01:11] Yeah, exactly.
[02:01:12] So that's not the game we're playing here.
[02:01:14] Yeah.
[02:01:15] I do see a lot of potential in you.
[02:01:16] And I think you could make more videos.
[02:01:18] Thank you.
[02:01:19] So much.
[02:01:20] So you got to watch out for obeying authority.
[02:01:25] Question authority all the time.
[02:01:29] And you've, then he talks about people seeking career advancement.
[02:01:34] There's another big one.
[02:01:36] And there's another big one I say no to.
[02:01:39] Right?
[02:01:40] There's such a much better way to get career advancement.
[02:01:44] And that is by doing a good job.
[02:01:46] Yeah.
[02:01:47] That's how you get career advancement.
[02:01:49] By instead of seeking career advancement, seek to do a good job, seek to make a difference.
[02:01:53] And then you need to seek to do what is right.
[02:01:55] The career is going to come in one form of the other.
[02:01:57] Now, might you get past up?
[02:02:01] Might some other guy that two to his own horn and took the credit.
[02:02:04] Might that happen?
[02:02:05] Yes, it might happen.
[02:02:07] You might, you might get delayed.
[02:02:09] But that guy's going to continue to build that reputation.
[02:02:12] And the boss is misted on the first round of advancements.
[02:02:15] So he got it.
[02:02:16] Yeah.
[02:02:17] Maybe he even gets the second round.
[02:02:18] By the third round, they're looking at him going.
[02:02:20] This guy's a self-serving loser.
[02:02:22] We need to get him off the team.
[02:02:24] And by the way, we've realized that the guy that's been behind all this work is echo over there.
[02:02:28] So we're going to promote him now.
[02:02:30] Now you're going to win.
[02:02:31] Now you've got a really solid reputation.
[02:02:33] So you can't, but the idea of seeking career advancement.
[02:02:37] You see that in the military all the time.
[02:02:38] There's people that are just trying to get advanced trying to get advanced trying to get them.
[02:02:41] Who's back?
[02:02:42] They're stepping on.
[02:02:43] And I'm telling you, I saw some of those guys get advanced.
[02:02:45] In my community, they advanced up through the ranks.
[02:02:48] They were stepping on people's backs to get there.
[02:02:50] The reputation eventually was so bad that it didn't get them propellant.
[02:02:53] They didn't propell as far as they wanted to.
[02:02:55] They look great guys.
[02:02:56] The guys that were really truly just trying to do the best for the community.
[02:03:00] Those guys got promoted and they would make it.
[02:03:02] You know, the furthest because their reputation was so solid.
[02:03:07] And everyone knew that these guys were doing the right things.
[02:03:09] So the right reason.
[02:03:10] Not so they could get promoted, but they ended up getting promoted.
[02:03:13] Yeah.
[02:03:14] Yeah.
[02:03:14] Promotions more like a eventuality.
[02:03:18] Yeah, it's eventuality.
[02:03:19] Yeah.
[02:03:20] It's just like you did, too.
[02:03:21] If you're just trying to get your belt.
[02:03:22] Yeah.
[02:03:23] And that's what you're trying to prove.
[02:03:24] That's not going to work out well for you.
[02:03:25] Getting mad when they're getting promoted.
[02:03:26] You might get your boot belt before some other white belt because you're showing off all the time.
[02:03:31] But eventually you're showing off all the time.
[02:03:33] Yeah.
[02:03:34] And the coach goes, hey, man, why don't you help everyone?
[02:03:36] Or the coach goes, hey, I see you're tapping a lot of people out.
[02:03:39] That are the same level as you all the time, but you're not going to anyone that's
[02:03:41] harder than you because you want to prove to me that you're tapping everyone out.
[02:03:43] Long move.
[02:03:44] You know what?
[02:03:45] You might see sometimes.
[02:03:46] You know, like, you know, when you come up through the jujitsu ranks, you just, you just
[02:03:51] find a certain move or handful of moves and you just, those moves, you get better out of
[02:03:56] quicker than other.
[02:03:57] Yeah, I think we all kind of are in one way or another.
[02:04:01] And so this is what, if you're pursuing the belt, this is what you do.
[02:04:06] And then instructors around.
[02:04:07] Only do your good moves.
[02:04:09] You want to look good.
[02:04:10] Yeah, you want to look good.
[02:04:11] That's all you do.
[02:04:12] You know.
[02:04:13] You do, and when you say it'll show itself later, you know, so what can happen is you get
[02:04:20] your blue belt.
[02:04:21] You get your purple belt because like you show off to your instructors or whatever.
[02:04:24] And in the tournament's too.
[02:04:25] I don't realize I just realize something about myself.
[02:04:28] I just had to be the awakening.
[02:04:30] But what will happen is later on, you ever get, okay, so this might, it might have been
[02:04:36] a long time for you, but maybe not.
[02:04:38] So, okay, so I'm taking, I'm training with,
[02:04:42] I'm sorry, I went to class Jeff Glovers teaching in class and Jeff Glovers like, hey, let's do this.
[02:04:47] And he does some crazy kind of advanced move.
[02:04:50] But it takes like, if you're an advanced person, you know how to, you know how to move your body and
[02:04:54] you get to kind of in an advanced way.
[02:04:56] You can do the move even though you've never done the move before.
[02:04:59] You know, that kind of what so is that kind of move is one where you got to like go
[02:05:02] between the guys like lift up into, you know, heal hook or whatever like last you choose.
[02:05:07] So, I don't do that move at all.
[02:05:10] And I've been training, I've been in this game for a long time.
[02:05:12] So, I go and I do it and I don't want to say I was surprised, but like I could do it.
[02:05:18] I could totally, but Jeff was like, oh, kind of like dang, because I'm bigger guy too, you know.
[02:05:23] And that made me think of this kind of thing where some guys, they can be a black belt.
[02:05:28] And they'll say, hey, show this move real quick and it'll be a black belt and they can't do it.
[02:05:32] Because they've avoided that.
[02:05:34] And not to say that this is the case all the time, I'm just saying that's like an example
[02:05:38] of how you can avoid getting better and only show off like XYZ to get you to that kind of next specific level.
[02:05:47] Yeah, I don't know.
[02:05:48] I don't know.
[02:05:49] This is a similar thing, maybe, but I realize when you were talking about this, what I'll do is both with Dean and with Jeff.
[02:05:59] If I do, if I'm doing something that they showed me, I'll like, I'll like call him out like a little kid.
[02:06:05] I'll be like, yeah, I mean, take this out.
[02:06:08] Yeah, yeah, I'd be like, oh, are you like that one?
[02:06:11] Yeah, I know how to do it with Dean with my kids.
[02:06:15] When my kids are training, you know, I'll say 18, 18, check.
[02:06:19] Oh, look at that.
[02:06:20] Look at that.
[02:06:21] He's going to get it.
[02:06:22] You know what I mean?
[02:06:22] Kind of like, I'll happy.
[02:06:23] Yeah, I guess I'm just happy that I'm learning or that they're learning.
[02:06:26] Yeah, that's too.
[02:06:27] But it's pretty cool when you can pull off what you just learned, right?
[02:06:30] Yeah, that's what it is.
[02:06:31] And it's cool for a teacher.
[02:06:32] I was, I'm still going to someone who does something that I showed them.
[02:06:34] Big time.
[02:06:35] So I guess the difference is, if in fact this is even the difference,
[02:06:39] is why did you do that?
[02:06:41] It's not to get your kid promoted.
[02:06:43] Yeah, it's not even to get me promoted because I can't get promoted right now.
[02:06:48] So I guess it's sort of like, maybe maybe the negative aspect would be like,
[02:06:54] I'm looking for some credit for pulling off of the move, the little guy move,
[02:06:58] totally different.
[02:06:59] I don't think it's, I think it's pretty bad.
[02:07:02] I think I'm pretty late for that.
[02:07:04] Yeah, so watch out for that, watch out for the career advancement.
[02:07:11] Don't let that be the folks your wife, man.
[02:07:13] It's gone.
[02:07:14] It's not going to make you, it's not going to get you what you want to, again,
[02:07:18] are there instances where you play the game so that you can move up so that you can have more control.
[02:07:24] Yes, I did that.
[02:07:25] I look, I went from in Lested Officer that's the ultimate in, hey, I'm going to play the game.
[02:07:30] I'm going to get more, I want to be in charge more stuff.
[02:07:32] So how am I going to do that?
[02:07:33] I'm going to skip all these ranks.
[02:07:34] I'm going to come in Officer.
[02:07:35] I did that.
[02:07:36] Yeah.
[02:07:36] I played that game.
[02:07:38] I was about my career.
[02:07:40] But I was about my career so I could make, you know, 15 guys in the soup to an happy.
[02:07:45] Yeah.
[02:07:46] Because I was happy when I had a good leader in my soup, too.
[02:07:49] Um, the other one he talks about here is this bureaucratization,
[02:07:55] and specialization, attenuating the sense of personal responsibility.
[02:08:01] This is another thing that we have to be careful of.
[02:08:05] Just because you're part of a system doesn't mean you should just, you know,
[02:08:11] blame the system when something goes wrong.
[02:08:13] You know, if you're working somewhere and something isn't going, hey, that's the way we do it.
[02:08:16] That's the way the system works.
[02:08:18] We can't change that.
[02:08:19] I never accepted that as an answer.
[02:08:21] And I'll tell you what.
[02:08:23] But the when you come up against that, you can't, the way you fight it when you come up against it is you build a relationship.
[02:08:32] Yeah.
[02:08:33] Right.
[02:08:33] So any, you ever, you ever have, you're trying to deal with some customer service or something.
[02:08:40] And you're getting the sorry, you can't help you.
[02:08:43] Yeah.
[02:08:44] And you go down to the starting like, hey, what's going on?
[02:08:47] I built, I'm a jockelman.
[02:08:49] I called you earlier.
[02:08:50] I just, I got to get this thing resolved here.
[02:08:52] And you know, you don't, you don't go down there and say, you need to take care of this.
[02:08:55] No, you say, hey, Bill, what's going on?
[02:08:57] Hey, I'm jockel.
[02:08:58] Yeah, man, I really like the piece of gear, but man, it worked good.
[02:09:02] There was a couple of issues I had with him.
[02:09:04] I'm trying to get him resolved because, you know, my daughters birthdays in two weeks.
[02:09:07] And I need that.
[02:09:08] You know what I mean?
[02:09:09] Yeah.
[02:09:10] Yeah.
[02:09:10] Let's get the bureaucratic.
[02:09:12] Don't let them stay in their big bureaucratic system.
[02:09:15] Yeah.
[02:09:16] We don't want to let that happen because then the, then the bureaucratic machine, then they're not.
[02:09:20] They're not the ones that are fending you.
[02:09:22] It's the machine.
[02:09:23] They can't control the machine.
[02:09:24] It's not the machine.
[02:09:25] There's part of the machine.
[02:09:26] You want to, you know, this concept fundamentally is the same as this.
[02:09:30] You know, when you're in traffic, you know, and you're trying to get over.
[02:09:33] Yeah.
[02:09:34] Yeah.
[02:09:35] Yeah.
[02:09:36] And you want to get in the lane, but, you know, from the other guys perspective or the other cars perspective,
[02:09:41] this car is trying to cut me off, this car.
[02:09:44] This car is going to get in my way, right?
[02:09:46] But you get your whoever you're riding with, all you got to get them rolled down the window.
[02:09:51] Make eye contact with a person and be like, hey, just wave out on something.
[02:09:55] Look, I'm a person, you're a person.
[02:09:57] Yeah.
[02:09:58] We're not standing in line.
[02:09:59] We're not standing in line.
[02:10:00] We're just, we're not going the same.
[02:10:01] Wow.
[02:10:02] That's what you feel.
[02:10:03] Yeah.
[02:10:03] You just give them that hint of a personal element.
[02:10:06] I'll let you write in the wave you in.
[02:10:08] Yeah.
[02:10:09] You wave back.
[02:10:09] You guys are friends that and before, give me my two seconds before that you're pissed.
[02:10:13] Yeah.
[02:10:14] This guy's about to get in front of me and there's no reason to be mad about that.
[02:10:17] By the way, it's not like you're sitting in the lane.
[02:10:18] You get there.
[02:10:19] Yeah.
[02:10:20] He's got to be somewhere, too.
[02:10:21] You're in the same direction.
[02:10:22] In the rush.
[02:10:23] Yeah.
[02:10:24] But you got to put it on your deal.
[02:10:26] Same thing, step out of the machine, man.
[02:10:28] The machine of trust step out.
[02:10:29] Hey, I'm a person, your person.
[02:10:30] Yes.
[02:10:31] Make the personal relationships up and down the chain of command throughout your company.
[02:10:34] Don't let the finance department, right?
[02:10:38] Yeah.
[02:10:39] The department, the policy.
[02:10:40] The finance department shut us down on this thing.
[02:10:42] Yeah.
[02:10:43] Who did that?
[02:10:44] I'm going to walk around there and say, yeah, see what happened.
[02:10:46] The marketing department won't give us any more.
[02:10:48] Okay.
[02:10:49] Cool.
[02:10:50] Let's find out who that is.
[02:10:51] It's not a bureaucratic, but it's not a marketing department.
[02:10:53] No, it's a machine.
[02:10:54] No, it's built.
[02:10:55] Builds in there.
[02:10:56] And when you, when Bill knows what you're trying to do, I know that you are trying to make something happen.
[02:11:01] You make that connection.
[02:11:02] And we're good to go.
[02:11:03] Bill's going to take care of you.
[02:11:04] No reason to freak out.
[02:11:06] The other thing, finally, here is this idea of this peer group, this social collect.
[02:11:12] A social collective peer pressure.
[02:11:15] We all know it exists and that's fine, but make it good.
[02:11:20] Right?
[02:11:21] Peer pressure is powerful.
[02:11:22] It's powerful.
[02:11:23] And the good thing is you get to control it in both directions.
[02:11:27] You need to recognize it when it's happening.
[02:11:28] You in a negative way.
[02:11:30] And then you need to use it in a positive way to help people do good things.
[02:11:37] Use peer pressure.
[02:11:38] Peer pressure is legit for making people do positive things.
[02:11:42] What you don't want to do is use peer pressure to make people do negative things.
[02:11:46] And there's a lot of that in the world.
[02:11:49] Then I'll tell you why there's a certain part of people that don't like to see other people succeed.
[02:11:54] Yeah.
[02:11:55] So they go, man, just come out tonight, dude.
[02:11:57] But dude, I've got to work in the morning.
[02:11:59] Dude, just come out.
[02:12:00] We're just going to get a couple of drinks.
[02:12:01] Yeah.
[02:12:02] Here's another one.
[02:12:03] Let's do a shot.
[02:12:04] You're always on that diet.
[02:12:05] Yeah.
[02:12:06] Hey, loosen up.
[02:12:07] Yeah, they want to see that.
[02:12:08] There's a certain part of people that want to see everyone else fail.
[02:12:15] Yeah.
[02:12:16] And if you've got to pay attention at yourself.
[02:12:18] Yes.
[02:12:19] You've got to pay attention at that in your own self.
[02:12:21] Because if you don't, you won't realize it.
[02:12:24] Yeah.
[02:12:25] But you're actually, I've seen people give other people bad advice because they're jealous.
[02:12:30] They're jealous.
[02:12:31] So in programs, I see the good thing about a friend of mine was going for a certain program in the military.
[02:12:36] And he came to me and he said, man, I was going to try this program.
[02:12:40] But a couple of guys were telling me I shouldn't.
[02:12:42] And I said, bro, that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
[02:12:46] They are jealous.
[02:12:47] They are jealous.
[02:12:48] They don't want you to do this program because it's going to make you more successful.
[02:12:51] Go do the program.
[02:12:52] And he said, okay.
[02:12:54] And he did it.
[02:12:56] Jockel peer pressure.
[02:12:57] Yeah.
[02:12:58] That's, I want to give peer pressure of goodness.
[02:13:00] You have a badness.
[02:13:01] And the thing is, I mean, I guess you could look at peer pressure in a way.
[02:13:05] In a way is, it's leadership.
[02:13:08] Whether you're standing up to it or whether you're spreading the positive peer pressure
[02:13:13] and that's leadership.
[02:13:14] And that's what we're here to do, man.
[02:13:16] We're here to do.
[02:13:17] We're here to lead.
[02:13:18] And when you use that in a positive way, you can prevent this kind of,
[02:13:24] it's kind of sick, sadistic, horrible horrific events like this.
[02:13:31] Like we read about today from happening in the midst of this.
[02:13:34] It's crazy that this occurred.
[02:13:37] Yeah.
[02:13:38] And it's crazy that it, you know, even even throughout the book and it, it's just referring to the Jews,
[02:13:49] right?
[02:13:50] It's just referring to the Jews.
[02:13:52] The Jews, the Jews lined up, the Jews laid down, the Jews got shot in the back of the neck.
[02:13:58] The Jews, the Jews, the Jews.
[02:14:01] Let's remember that every single one of those Jews was a name, was a person, right?
[02:14:08] Was Bill was, you know, we do the same thing.
[02:14:12] We're putting them in a sort of big chunk of machinery that they're just, they're part of the product of what's happening over here.
[02:14:19] And yeah, don't do it on either side.
[02:14:24] Yeah.
[02:14:25] Don't let it happen on either side.
[02:14:26] Don't let it happen on your life.
[02:14:29] Don't do it.
[02:14:34] That's what leadership is about.
[02:14:36] It really is.
[02:14:37] And leadership, the thing about leadership is leadership is happening at all times.
[02:14:44] The minute you are interacting with another person, leadership is taking place.
[02:14:49] You're either being led, which is fine, or you're leading, which is fine.
[02:14:53] As long as you're going in the right direction.
[02:14:56] But if you constantly think, and you're leading yourself by the way, of course, you're leading yourself.
[02:15:01] You're constantly leading yourself.
[02:15:03] But the minute you meet with someone else, there's a leadership situation happening.
[02:15:07] Either leading that person or you're being led.
[02:15:11] And that's okay.
[02:15:12] It's okay to be led, as long as you're being led in the right direction.
[02:15:14] If you start seeing yourself being led in the wrong direction and you go with it, you're at fault.
[02:15:19] You're at fault.
[02:15:20] You can't blame that person.
[02:15:22] You went along with it.
[02:15:24] You're culpable for your actions.
[02:15:29] So, again, I know it's a brutal topic to cover.
[02:15:33] And I'm sure we'll be back at it again at some point.
[02:15:38] But let's not forget that this happened.
[02:15:44] And that if we're not careful, it can happen again.
[02:15:49] And you get little things like in way, lower levels.
[02:15:54] That stuff happens all the time.
[02:15:55] You know, like little riots break out, normal people destroying cars.
[02:15:59] Because that's kind of what everyone's doing.
[02:16:02] You know, don't want guys like, hey stop.
[02:16:04] We're going to stop.
[02:16:05] We're like, okay, let me stop.
[02:16:07] Yeah.
[02:16:08] The peer pressure thing, that's why people, you get to work out, buddy.
[02:16:13] Or you join.
[02:16:16] That's like CrossFit.
[02:16:21] Because everyone's like, hey, yeah, you know, like the true you want.
[02:16:24] And you can't, in a way, you look forward to just linking up with the group.
[02:16:27] And the group's talking about like, you know, doing good stuff.
[02:16:30] Yeah, working out.
[02:16:31] And you're right.
[02:16:32] And as a matter of fact, there's our whole new phenomenon in the fitness world,
[02:16:37] which is basically all stems from CrossFit.
[02:16:40] And they call it just group exercise.
[02:16:42] Right.
[02:16:42] Yeah.
[02:16:43] Hey, we got group exercise.
[02:16:44] Yeah, group exercise classes.
[02:16:45] Because, hey, I want to work out with other people.
[02:16:47] I want to have, you know, echo call me up.
[02:16:49] Me, okay, you're going to make it to class tonight.
[02:16:50] Yeah.
[02:16:51] I'm kind of feeling lazy.
[02:16:52] Come on, bro.
[02:16:53] Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm going.
[02:16:54] Yeah.
[02:16:55] Oh, okay.
[02:16:56] I don't want to be weak.
[02:16:57] Yeah, yeah.
[02:16:57] You know, you're pressing me to be strong.
[02:16:58] That's good.
[02:16:59] Yep.
[02:17:00] True story.
[02:17:01] So, you use that in a positive way.
[02:17:05] Yeah, you ever, you ever been, well, you probably,
[02:17:08] oh, yeah, you probably have come on.
[02:17:10] We can be honest here.
[02:17:11] You know, the kind where you're like, okay,
[02:17:14] I'm going to link up with whoever to go train or to go work out of whatever.
[02:17:18] And you're like, dang, I don't really want to.
[02:17:20] One of the time comes.
[02:17:21] You're like, dang, I don't really feel like it.
[02:17:23] I, in the back of my mind, I hope that they call in cancel.
[02:17:27] I hope.
[02:17:28] And then they call, they don't cancel.
[02:17:31] They call to confirm.
[02:17:33] And you go.
[02:17:34] You didn't want to go.
[02:17:35] You go.
[02:17:36] At the end of the work, I, you're like, dang, I almost didn't,
[02:17:39] I almost didn't make it to the good thing, you know?
[02:17:41] That's common, man.
[02:17:42] It is.
[02:17:43] I don't tell you people asked me about this a lot.
[02:17:45] You've got to recognize, you got to start to memorize that good feeling that comes after a good workout.
[02:17:51] Yeah.
[02:17:52] So that you don't have to force yourself through it in anticipation.
[02:17:56] Such a good way to put it.
[02:17:57] To memorize the feeling.
[02:17:59] Memorize the feeling of like, I memorize two feelings.
[02:18:02] One is, I memorize how good it feels when you're done.
[02:18:05] Yeah.
[02:18:06] And two, I memorize how bad it feels when you're weak.
[02:18:08] Yeah.
[02:18:09] And you say, no.
[02:18:10] Yeah.
[02:18:11] I hate that feeling.
[02:18:12] I hate that feeling of like, I didn't do it.
[02:18:16] Yeah.
[02:18:17] It makes me feel like junk.
[02:18:19] Junk.
[02:18:20] I was just on the road.
[02:18:23] And it was like, it don't do it.
[02:18:26] I just feel like, man, I squeezed in a couple of workouts at night.
[02:18:29] Pretty weak workouts, but just to get them done.
[02:18:31] You know what I mean?
[02:18:32] Just to move.
[02:18:33] Yeah.
[02:18:34] The worst thing you can do is be sedentary.
[02:18:35] Yeah.
[02:18:36] And I was moving during the day because we were in the water and whatnot.
[02:18:39] Yeah.
[02:18:40] That's a little bit different.
[02:18:41] Yeah.
[02:18:42] But you got to get it done.
[02:18:44] Yeah.
[02:18:45] So memorize the feeling.
[02:18:46] So there's nothing worse than the feeling of I slept in.
[02:18:49] Well, why does that?
[02:18:51] I don't understand these for you.
[02:18:52] That's probably the wrong statement.
[02:18:54] I don't like the feeling of I slept in and now I'm behind the power curve.
[02:18:58] Yeah.
[02:18:59] That's the feeling.
[02:19:00] Yeah.
[02:19:01] Memorize that feeling.
[02:19:02] Yeah.
[02:19:03] And then run from it.
[02:19:05] Speaking of memorize.
[02:19:06] You're going to go over everything that everyone just memorized.
[02:19:09] I think at this point where you talk about how they can sport the podcast.
[02:19:12] Sure.
[02:19:13] Actually, I'm going to go in and in.
[02:19:14] Yeah.
[02:19:15] I'm going to go in at a different angle.
[02:19:16] I'm going to say speaking of peer pressure.
[02:19:20] Because this is really what it is.
[02:19:22] The group.
[02:19:23] You peer pressure.
[02:19:24] Me, you peer pressure.
[02:19:25] We collectively peer pressure each other.
[02:19:28] And this is what we're doing.
[02:19:29] We're working out.
[02:19:30] There's no reason not to work out today.
[02:19:32] Nowadays.
[02:19:33] Not to mean this day today.
[02:19:34] Today could be your rest day.
[02:19:35] But you should work out today too.
[02:19:36] You should have.
[02:19:37] Yes.
[02:19:38] Later even if you haven't already.
[02:19:40] Anyway.
[02:19:41] This is what we're doing.
[02:19:43] We're working out.
[02:19:44] Yes.
[02:19:45] If we have weight to lose, we know if we're overweight.
[02:19:48] We do.
[02:19:49] Even if we're like five pounds overweight.
[02:19:51] Think of like your ideal weight.
[02:19:53] Think of that.
[02:19:54] If you're not that.
[02:19:55] 150 pounds.
[02:19:56] That's my idea.
[02:19:58] When you roll to someone that's massive.
[02:20:01] Yeah.
[02:20:02] And you think by which I was this massive.
[02:20:05] I wish I was, you know, 450 pounds because then you just smash everyone.
[02:20:10] Yeah.
[02:20:11] But that might get in the way.
[02:20:13] You know, other aspects of life.
[02:20:15] Like if you're 450 pounds, that would mean what?
[02:20:18] How tall? Like what? 68.
[02:20:19] No.
[02:20:20] I would want to be like eight foot nine.
[02:20:22] Yeah.
[02:20:23] Okay.
[02:20:23] So surfing is going to be an issue for you.
[02:20:25] Oh, yes.
[02:20:26] So, okay.
[02:20:27] So to kind of say goodbye to your current knowledge or your current schema.
[02:20:30] A surfer.
[02:20:31] Say goodbye to that.
[02:20:32] Good point.
[02:20:33] Good point.
[02:20:34] There's other things.
[02:20:35] So you're just thinking, you just do I understand?
[02:20:37] Just you're in an end just MMA.
[02:20:39] Or maybe out of the weight classes though.
[02:20:41] Yeah.
[02:20:42] Yeah.
[02:20:42] So you'd have to fight in these weird.
[02:20:44] We're talking about the future.
[02:20:45] I'm just going to be a big picture.
[02:20:46] I'll just be what I am.
[02:20:48] Actually, you know what about seven.
[02:20:50] If you go about do you, bro.
[02:20:52] If you want to be that big.
[02:20:53] That's your ideal weight.
[02:20:54] You go with that.
[02:20:55] 750 pounds.
[02:20:56] Yeah.
[02:20:57] And that's really the point.
[02:20:59] The point is you know your ideal weight.
[02:21:00] You do not me.
[02:21:01] You know.
[02:21:02] I don't have an ideal weight free.
[02:21:03] You may be I do, but it has to be my ideal.
[02:21:05] You want me to win.
[02:21:06] I want to win.
[02:21:07] I want to win.
[02:21:08] I want your child's.
[02:21:09] Exactly.
[02:21:10] And be less mentally strong.
[02:21:12] But for everyone else, we all know how much we want to weigh or whatever.
[02:21:17] Whatever.
[02:21:18] So this is what we're doing.
[02:21:19] Pure pressure.
[02:21:21] We're going to do that.
[02:21:22] We're going to pursue that.
[02:21:23] We're working out.
[02:21:24] We are getting control of our ego.
[02:21:28] We're moving forward.
[02:21:34] And we're going to
[02:21:32] Pavel Tumper and other various weaknesses.
[02:21:35] Also to facilitate that, we are taking control oil.
[02:21:40] If our joinist is sorry, that's what we're doing because.
[02:21:42] Problem solved ultimately is just one big problem.
[02:21:44] So its all thing thing, you know.
[02:21:46] So we're doing it wrong because we're ignoring.
[02:21:49] The problem is I don't want to get the money.
[02:21:51] So no one enough wants to be that someone is responsible for this.
[02:21:52] So cream.
[02:21:55] The idea is it's that there is basically 100 percent man in the world.
[02:21:57] Shelf.

[02:22:08] Other stuff on on it. I took some new mood today. Interesting. I'm not necessarily in a new mood
[02:22:16] I think I'm in the same mood, but I don't think that's what it is. I think it's more and just you know
[02:22:20] Balancing out your whole stuff. Yeah, I just took it because it was there and that's the kind of thing that I won't take
[02:22:26] You don't want to be Balancing. I want current mood
[02:22:32] Young curler. What if you're feeling angry good?
[02:22:35] Then I'm good to go. I'm fairly certain it's for brain health, you know, and I think the new mood
[02:22:40] It like mood part of it is more of like a kind of a happenstance kind of cool thing like you know
[02:22:47] Anyway, maybe I took some of that I have some of that. I'm down for that
[02:22:51] There's a bunch of other stuff performance stuff, you know
[02:22:54] So if you're like hey, I'm getting after it. I want performance supplementation. That's what we're doing too. We're doing all this stuff as a group
[02:23:02] So let's jokalo
[02:23:04] Our current leader
[02:23:07] I think this is a group without a leader until someone tells them to stop then we're all stopping anyway
[02:23:13] Also good way to support
[02:23:15] And this is just to support yourself and support the group really because you know, okay, so this book these books all these books
[02:23:22] We read these books sure we're just in jok go over it and it's dope, but you know
[02:23:28] You want to get the book if you want to get the book and we know I'm reading less than 10% of the books. Yeah
[02:23:34] 5% it's like a book report although I might have gone a little bit crazy with Sydney Jerry last week
[02:23:39] Yeah, I wonder if you guys want to do it just fall on the audio book
[02:23:44] Just start and I'll stop seven hours later. Oh, three and a half. Yeah, that's it
[02:23:49] So because some good lessons though. Yeah, they're all they're all good lessons
[02:23:53] How many people see you know podcast three hours and 27 minutes and go come on jok
[02:24:00] Come on yeah, and how many people actually know what they say come on echo
[02:24:04] You talked about it. He talked about you talked about support for two hours and 27 minutes
[02:24:11] Come on, Brad's not my fault. That's the machine
[02:24:14] You know, I did a small little party guilty
[02:24:17] Anyway, if you want the books or one or whatever

[02:24:48] Straight up seats and now you're telling us real heavy peer pressure on everyone. Yeah, but it this is good peer pressure
[02:24:52] You said good peer pressure is good. Well, that is good because we're not you just do just helping
[02:24:58] Yeah, podcast doesn't cost anything exactly right boom
[02:25:02] And that's what we're doing also what we're doing is
[02:25:05] Subscribe eating what were you gonna say? I was gonna say continue talking all right there you go. I will and so subscribe to the podcast
[02:25:13] That's what we're all doing. I'm subscribed to the podcast and I'm on you know
[02:25:17] Yeah, well obviously we're all gonna do it
[02:25:20] Subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already
[02:25:23] Also on YouTube subscribe to that one
[02:25:26] That's a good one. That's where you make all those videos. All the videos only you're doing three videos a week
[02:25:30] Yeah, man that's the right not seeing that three of this in the future
[02:25:34] podcast video video format that your count. Yes
[02:25:40] So you're doing one podcast video and one and then two excerpts two excerpts
[02:25:44] Minimal is what I'm seeing okay? That's kind of so we should have a lot of excerpts up there
[02:25:49] Do you know and they grow every week?
[02:25:52] You know, so the and the benefit to those by the way
[02:25:54] You don't make your excerpts shorter why?
[02:25:57] Because they're too long a 12 minute excerpts not even an expert the excerpt. That's just another five
[02:26:02] That's the same that goes back to the same problem. It's essentially an all-in-one
[02:26:06] You need to do edit them. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[02:26:11] Amazing isn't it?
[02:26:13] Just be like boom so much. We'll listen to it in 30 seconds and be like oh, I got the gut the deal here
[02:26:17] Yeah, so okay, so the problem is with you is you enjoy the
[02:26:23] You enjoy the arc of the conversation. Yeah, see people want to hear the arc of the conversation
[02:26:27] They just listen to a whole podcast. Maybe I've been hangar with you too long because last week
[02:26:31] The way you were feeling you couldn't edit out just that whole you know 45 minutes of whatever same thing you get
[02:26:39] So part of that is a joke, but part of his a series, so you can you know how like okay
[02:26:42] I'm listening to your whole little segment and I'm gonna cut it right
[02:26:47] I'm gonna cut it right here and then your little follow-up comment is cool and then maybe I say something
[02:26:51] Which is like and whatever I can cut myself out easily, but then your follow-up to me is kind of cool
[02:26:56] I'm like, hey, that's important to I should leave that part in it
[02:26:58] So it just turns into this thing 12 minutes of extra
[02:27:03] Whatever that only I'm gonna talk or check and make half chicken nuggets
[02:27:09] Jockel and you rest with fine leg
[02:27:13] Yeah, they're not make nuggets anymore know actually they are, but you know that's an exception
[02:27:17] Sometimes they're 12 minutes. Hey, man. There's a lot of other things
[02:27:19] We could actually we could actually
[02:27:21] Re-shoot like re-record just the pertinent parts of you can't edit it out without like yeah
[02:27:26] No, that's a step backwards. I think I'm just making it repetitive, you know anyway
[02:27:32] That's a good way to support subscribe to YouTube channel boom
[02:27:36] Sharable stuff on there in the event of the excerpts not being told minutes in them in the event of them being three minutes or so
[02:27:43] You can share more shareable
[02:27:47] In fact I
[02:27:49] saw when I was like right after I posted it and then I think he was like

[02:29:59] The next hoodies are gonna be thick and heavy a lasking style
[02:30:02] Okay, Minnesota style
[02:30:05] You know what I was thinking on tannist
[02:30:08] Not not not hoist a
[02:30:10] Why stop why not go a step where we get a both because look you can't exclude the comma
[02:30:16] I know oh
[02:30:18] It means it means the people
[02:30:21] Technically when you think about it comma I know comma
[02:30:25] I know means land so people land. Yeah. I got a pretty good guest right there. Yeah. There you go
[02:30:30] Come on anyway you can neglect those folks. Okay. They're cool. We need to make a

[02:30:45] You know
[02:30:47] Representing
[02:30:48] Anyway, yeah, so rash guards on there like I said the okay, what I was gonna say is yeah
[02:30:52] Jocco has a certain and we've mentioned it before Jocco has a shirt now
[02:30:56] Well
[02:30:58] Technically he designed to shirt
[02:31:02] Varying levels of acceptance on my end. Yeah, it's the echo shirt
[02:31:08] Some people call it the dang shirt. Yeah, the echo shirt. There's some layers there
[02:31:12] You might be able to figure them out technically. There's more layers on the shirt than any other shirt
[02:31:16] Really be the most layered shirt. Oh, well, the fact that I made it is a layer. It's all right
[02:31:20] It is my page but well, my evaluation is it's interesting
[02:31:26] It was actually impressive the design is impressive like the layers and stuff. You know a design exclusively by Jocco
[02:31:36] So now I'm a fashion designer correct artist fashion designer. You know who would have fun
[02:31:41] I'm neither
[02:31:43] Technically you're well, I'm not technically either anyway that one's on there right now
[02:31:50] Right this very moment don't turn there if you want to check it out. I'm not saying to buy it
[02:31:54] I'm not saying that I'm saying check I think that shirt's gonna be popular with your head on it
[02:31:59] It's by the way it has echoes head on it because
[02:32:03] There's a layer
[02:32:05] In
[02:32:07] You got to see it. I don't know what I'm saying is though is
[02:32:10] somebody that somebody that like
[02:32:12] Doesn't want to just be forthcoming like for instance
[02:32:16] A lot of the shirts that we have that have layers to them. You don't know exactly what like know the darkest right?
[02:32:22] No one knows what the hell that has to do with the
[02:32:24] The Jocco podcast shirt the one that says Jocco podcast on okay, we know there's there's some layers there
[02:32:30] But it's pretty it's also pretty forthcoming what it means. Yeah, the shirt that I made
[02:32:35] For you with your head on it no one's gonna have any idea what that is
[02:32:38] It's so people automatically have some good layers there just by wearing that
[02:32:43] But it's not you know what's gonna have any idea what this is why is that per human's head on your chest?
[02:32:50] You're saying external people yes people who do
[02:32:54] Yeah, absolutely yeah
[02:32:55] Absolutely people in the game. They're gonna get the whole thing and they're gonna be like holy cut chocolate
[02:32:59] It's like if you listen to a band and
[02:33:01] You just you have a shirt that doesn't say the band name on it, but it's got the album cover
[02:33:06] Yeah, and people know
[02:33:08] People that know no people that listen
[02:33:10] Right if they listen they know same thing with this shirt if they don't listen they're not gonna know if they listen
[02:33:15] You're gonna get cred
[02:33:21] But yeah, that's a good one anyway. Jocco start.com. That's a good one
[02:33:23] That's what we're doing also what we're doing straight up is in the
[02:33:28] In the moments of weakness that we may or may not have
[02:33:31] Some won't solve them more than others, but what we do is we turn to psychological warfare if you know what that is
[02:33:38] This is what it's psychological warfare is an album with tracks tracks
[02:33:42] Dig it and these tracks what they do is they
[02:33:47] give you a spot
[02:33:49] with
[02:33:50] Any weakness or weak moments you have so
[02:33:54] If you're waking up early every single day and that one day comes or whatever that
[02:33:58] And I think that alarm so or that my bed is extra comfy. I mean, you know, I'm maybe I'll sleep in
[02:34:03] You don't want to have slept in, but that's how you feel at that moment that moment of weakness
[02:34:09] Play one of the tracks
[02:34:12] Wake up and get up, right?
[02:34:14] I don't use that particular track. I could use the workout one, so it's different
[02:34:17] But it'll help you through it'll give you that spot just like when you're and I said this before and this makes perfect sense
[02:34:23] This is what we're doing
[02:34:25] And when we jump onto the bench and we take on lofty challenges on the bench press
[02:34:31] We're gonna grab a guide of spot us not to say he's gonna touch the bar and not to say any of that, but
[02:34:37] We that we have a lofty challenge, so we got the spot to ensure our success
[02:34:43] So to me
[02:34:45] If you're not doing anything if you're not pursuing anything then this isn't for you
[02:34:50] You just gotta get up and whatever time you get up and go to wherever you do whatever you do come home to your thing
[02:34:56] Which is cool. That's not what we're doing though
[02:35:00] So I say while we do our big things
[02:35:04] I'm gonna get our spot. It's called psychological warfare. I'm not saying to use it. I'm saying, but if you need it
[02:35:09] You got it to ensure your success
[02:35:11] It's okay. That's good. Thank you appreciate that one. Yeah, yeah, thank you
[02:35:20] Hey

[02:36:33] Get him or her this book so they can get better faster stronger
[02:36:39] And before you give it to them
[02:36:41] Low advice read it yourself Uncle Jake has something for all of us. That's for sure
[02:36:47] Also discipline equals freedom field manual
[02:36:52] I brought like a rough copy. I forget what they there's some name that they call this
[02:36:56] I've called this this one my third book up all this. I still don't understand the publishing like they have certain words and stuff
[02:37:02] They use
[02:37:03] Terms sure
[02:37:04] I'm gonna do this blah blah blah. How do I say what does that mean? But this is the book this is the book inside the cover
[02:37:12] So a couple things does this have a flashy cover that's gonna attract you know people to buy it. No, it doesn't it's got an all black cover flat
[02:37:22] That's what it's got
[02:37:24] Is it got some you know some interesting fluff in there for you to feel good about yourself? No that stuff's not in there either
[02:37:29] Does it have these incredible life hacks that gonna teach you how to rise?
[02:37:33] In fulfill your dreams through simple things that you can do. No those aren't in there either
[02:37:41] It's called a discipline equals freedom field manual

[02:37:49] There you go if you're on YouTube there's the book right there. Oh, what does it look like?
[02:37:53] Hard to see against the black background because it's black. Yeah. Yeah. It's not so you can see the cover
[02:37:58] That's not what the books for no no
[02:38:00] Although the cover does get you yeah, yeah, it's not so that's that that's that you can work that comes out October 17th
[02:38:10] The assumption is
[02:38:12] You might want to order it now so you get a copy when it first comes out
[02:38:16] Otherwise people will have discipline before you and that's gonna not gonna work out good for you
