00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.88
This is Jockel Podcast number 53 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening,

2
00:00:08.88 --> 00:00:27.84
I go. Good evening. At one point, do you quit? At what point do you give in? At what point

3
00:00:27.84 --> 00:00:38.76
do you surrender? And what is it that makes you surrender? The enemy fatigue hunger.

4
00:00:38.76 --> 00:01:01.64
First, bitter cold. Who are these men that decide that they will not surrender no matter what?

5
00:01:01.64 --> 00:01:14.04
What will, what human will do they have? That they decide they are going to fight on no matter

6
00:01:14.04 --> 00:01:33.08
what they face? Well, I will tell you, these men are men. They're human beings. Like you,

7
00:01:33.08 --> 00:01:39.88
like me, human beings that decide they are going to fight on despite being surrounded by the

8
00:01:39.88 --> 00:01:49.000
enemy despite the hunger and the danger and the thirst and the bitter cold. They decide they will not surrender.

9
00:01:53.40 --> 00:02:05.56
We can find examples of these men throughout history. But one of the four most examples comes from the

10
00:02:05.56 --> 00:02:18.36
Korean War. In late November and into mid December of 1950, when 30,000 UN troops, mostly American,

11
00:02:18.36 --> 00:02:28.60
were surrounded by 120,000 communist Chinese forces. And these Americans were attacked,

12
00:02:28.60 --> 00:02:36.68
by the enemy, and attacked by the bitter freezing cold, and attacked by hunger and fear, and yet they

13
00:02:36.68 --> 00:02:47.96
would not, and they did not surrender. And tonight we're going to hear from Lieutenant

14
00:02:49.16 --> 00:02:57.000
in the United States Marine Corps, Joseph R. Owen, who served as a mortar section commander for

15
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.32
Baker Company, first battalion, seventh Marine Regiment, first Marine Division.

16
00:03:04.76 --> 00:03:14.92
In his book, we just called colder than hell. And the book starts off with one of the best

17
00:03:14.92 --> 00:03:21.48
short overviews of the Korean War I've ever read, likely, because it's written by a man who is there.

18
00:03:21.48 --> 00:03:31.32
A man named General Raymond Davis Ray Davis, who, first of all, he was a battalion commander in

19
00:03:31.32 --> 00:03:39.16
World War II at the Battle of Pelaloo, awarded the Navy Cross there for leading his men against

20
00:03:39.16 --> 00:03:47.64
overwhelming Japanese fire in Korea. He was awarded the Medal of Honor,

21
00:03:47.64 --> 00:03:55.96
as well as two silver stars, a legion of merit, and a bronze star,

22
00:03:57.80 --> 00:04:05.32
as the commander of first battalion, seventh Marines. And beyond that, he also served

23
00:04:06.44 --> 00:04:12.28
as the third Marine Division commander in Vietnam in 1969, where he was awarded the Navy

24
00:04:12.28 --> 00:04:18.60
Distinguished Service Medal and three Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Crosses. So when he speaks,

25
00:04:20.76 --> 00:04:27.80
I think maybe we should listen. And I'm going to start with that forward

26
00:04:27.80 --> 00:04:45.48
by General Davis in the book, colder than hell, by Joe Owen. Twice in 1950.

27
00:04:46.60 --> 00:04:51.16
During the first month of the Korean War of the United States faced military catastrophe,

28
00:04:52.36 --> 00:04:57.48
both situations occurred because of American errors of diplomacy and faulty intelligence,

29
00:04:57.48 --> 00:05:01.96
and because our military was not prepared to meet a determined enemy on the battlefield.

30
00:05:04.04 --> 00:05:08.68
North Korea and China were the enemies that exploited our failings.

31
00:05:10.60 --> 00:05:16.28
On two occasions, that year they called us by surprise, launching massive attacks first

32
00:05:16.28 --> 00:05:20.28
against our ally South Korea and then against our own inadequate forces.

33
00:05:20.28 --> 00:05:28.52
Both times the consequences were devastating. There were tragic numbers of casualties in the ranks

34
00:05:28.52 --> 00:05:34.36
of our soldiers and Marines, and American prestige worldwide was severely impaired.

35
00:05:36.04 --> 00:05:41.08
The surprise invasion of South Korea by North Korea with the support of communist China and the

36
00:05:41.08 --> 00:05:49.32
Soviet Union was virtually invited by the United States and the South Koreans. South Korea was vulnerable.

37
00:05:49.32 --> 00:05:54.36
Its soldiers were ill-equipped, poorly trained, and improperly deployed.

38
00:05:55.48 --> 00:06:02.68
The American forces at that time victims of Washington politics and false economies were nearly as bad

39
00:06:02.68 --> 00:06:11.40
off, following the end of World War II drowned, drawdown. They were in skeletonized formation,

40
00:06:11.40 --> 00:06:14.36
sadly, untrained and inadequately equipped.

41
00:06:14.36 --> 00:06:19.32
So there's a little warning for us today.

42
00:06:21.32 --> 00:06:27.56
Somebody asked me that question. What's your foreign policy? Can you say it in 140 characters?

43
00:06:27.56 --> 00:06:32.36
Somebody asked me that on Twitter. I answered it in one word. My foreign policy is strength.

44
00:06:33.64 --> 00:06:39.88
This is why. Back to the book. Moreover, our Secretary of State had proclaimed to the world

45
00:06:39.88 --> 00:06:46.04
that the Korean Peninsula was outside the area of American vital interests. North Korea, China,

46
00:06:46.04 --> 00:06:50.60
the Soviet Union, read that message to me that the United States would not defend South Korea

47
00:06:50.60 --> 00:06:56.60
against outside aggression. South Korea would be theirs for the taking.

48
00:06:58.52 --> 00:07:04.92
We now know of messages exchanged between Joseph Stalin and the North Korean President

49
00:07:04.92 --> 00:07:11.56
Kim Il-sung that explored our weakness and concluded that South Korea could be captured in five days.

50
00:07:13.80 --> 00:07:18.20
Subsequently, the North Koreans launched a sudden and massive invasion.

51
00:07:18.20 --> 00:07:23.000
Solve the North Korean capital, it's quickly taken, and soon all that country was overrun,

52
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.60
except for one small pocket around the port of Busan.

53
00:07:28.92 --> 00:07:31.24
That pocket was formed by American troops.

54
00:07:31.24 --> 00:07:37.48
On ready as they were, that President Harry Truman hurried into Korean response to the crisis.

55
00:07:39.08 --> 00:07:44.52
At great sacrifice, these American soldiers with a follow-on brigade of Marines held the

56
00:07:44.52 --> 00:07:49.80
Busan perimeter long enough to allow forces to assemble for an amphibious assault on In-Chop

57
00:07:50.52 --> 00:07:57.40
behind the North Korean lines. We recaptured Seoul and the North Koreans were put on the run.

58
00:07:57.40 --> 00:08:02.28
Fearing in trapmen, they fled back across their border to the North.

59
00:08:03.08 --> 00:08:08.60
American and South Korean troops were joined by soldiers from other United Nations countries

60
00:08:08.60 --> 00:08:16.28
and pursued the aggressors deep into North Korea. Our mission was too fold to punish the North Koreans

61
00:08:16.84 --> 00:08:21.32
and to block the Chinese people's liberation army if it threatened to enter the war.

62
00:08:21.32 --> 00:08:28.36
Because of a failure of intelligence, however, we were far too late to deter the Chinese.

63
00:08:29.56 --> 00:08:34.44
They had already positioned vast numbers of been well-trained soldiers in the mountains of North Korea.

64
00:08:35.24 --> 00:08:41.16
We were soon under heavy attack fighting a numerically superior enemy in unfavorable terrain

65
00:08:41.16 --> 00:08:48.12
and brutally cold weather. The UN forces predominantly American were chased out of North Korea.

66
00:08:48.12 --> 00:08:56.92
At the chosen reservoir, where we were outnumbered 10 to 1, the Chinese generals prematurely

67
00:08:56.92 --> 00:09:03.56
boasted of the destruction of the first Marine division. Yet the opposite happened there.

68
00:09:04.44 --> 00:09:09.80
Although the Marines were forced to withdraw, we destroyed several Chinese divisions as we

69
00:09:09.80 --> 00:09:16.92
fought our way to the sea and to escape. Our withdrawal was a successful one but we paid a terrible

70
00:09:16.92 --> 00:09:25.48
price. Casualties reduced the division to nearly half its strength. The three rifle companies of

71
00:09:25.48 --> 00:09:31.000
first battalion, seventh Marine regimen, which I was privileged to command and dirt losses of even

72
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.76
greater proportions. My battalion had been hastily activated in response to President Truman's

73
00:09:38.76 --> 00:09:44.28
urgent call to action. It was a thrown together rifle company, a collection of

74
00:09:44.28 --> 00:09:49.40
regulars gathered from Marine Corps posts and stations all over the world and reservists,

75
00:09:49.40 --> 00:09:56.52
mostly untrained, who were suddenly called from their homes, jobs, schools with only a few days of

76
00:09:56.52 --> 00:10:02.84
training. They were embarked aboard a ship heading across the Pacific and thrown into combat.

77
00:10:05.88 --> 00:10:12.12
They had to learn to fight while under fire. Their saving grace was that they were led

78
00:10:12.12 --> 00:10:19.48
by disciplined officers and NCOs who showed them by upfront example how to fight like Marines.

79
00:10:22.20 --> 00:10:27.96
Although they suffered casualties that proper preparation would have avoided, they learned

80
00:10:27.96 --> 00:10:35.000
well and they hardened into fine rifle company. No North Korean or Chinese force ever stop

81
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:44.68
them from taking it objective or overcame their position. Let us do all we can to assure that no

82
00:10:44.68 --> 00:10:54.04
future generation of young Americans need to go to war unprepared as were those heroes who went

83
00:10:54.04 --> 00:11:07.000
to Korea in 1950. And again that is the forward of the book which was written by General Raymond Davis

84
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:17.24
Medal of Honor winner. And like I said, the book is written by Joe Owen Joseph Owen who was

85
00:11:17.24 --> 00:11:29.08
Marine Corps officer. And let's continue on and now we start here in from Joe Owen.

86
00:11:30.44 --> 00:11:36.76
They're at Camp Lijoon North Carolina. Nobody at Camp Lijoon had expected a shooting war.

87
00:11:36.76 --> 00:11:41.32
We know we were ready for one. So they're they're they're just kind of peacetime

88
00:11:41.32 --> 00:11:49.56
Marines, you know, kind of doing their thing and all of a sudden the North Koreans attack.

89
00:11:49.56 --> 00:11:53.48
And here we go. They're all sitting around listening to the radio a bunch of Marines.

90
00:11:55.56 --> 00:12:00.36
The announcer continued more than 2000 Americans military advisors and civilian workers and their

91
00:12:00.36 --> 00:12:06.20
families are said to be in the path of North Koreans surprise aggression. Their fate is unknown at this

92
00:12:06.20 --> 00:12:15.24
time. American involvement in the New War is not clear. War yeah! The possibility of American

93
00:12:15.24 --> 00:12:21.24
Marines in a combat role excited us. So these guys are young. Not all of them. There's there's

94
00:12:21.24 --> 00:12:27.48
definitely we're going to run into many World War II veterans but the young kids they don't know

95
00:12:27.48 --> 00:12:31.72
they want to get after it. They're they're fired up. They're so fired up back to the book.

96
00:12:31.72 --> 00:12:37.40
One story alleged that a commando force of volunteers was forming up for an immediate

97
00:12:37.40 --> 00:12:43.80
commitment to battle. That one tied up phone lines on the base as we tried to track down the

98
00:12:43.80 --> 00:12:47.64
commando headquarters in order to volunteer. They're all ready to rock and roll.

99
00:12:49.24 --> 00:12:52.92
Now then they start seeing what what's beginning to occur.

100
00:12:54.84 --> 00:12:58.36
They see that we're surrounded. They see that we're kind of getting the North Koreans are getting

101
00:12:58.36 --> 00:13:04.28
the best if not routing. Back to the book Americans at home were stunned by reports that their

102
00:13:04.28 --> 00:13:10.20
army, the conqueror of the mighty Germany and Japan only five years before was outnumbered,

103
00:13:10.20 --> 00:13:17.88
outgunned and out fought by the upstart North Koreans. General MacArthur called for a full

104
00:13:17.88 --> 00:13:24.12
division of Marines to help him turn back the North Koreans. The Marine Corps welcomed the call

105
00:13:24.12 --> 00:13:31.16
but we did not have a full division to put in the field. Like all the services the Corps had

106
00:13:31.16 --> 00:13:36.76
been stripped of men and weapons in order to reduce itself to the level of the 1930s.

107
00:13:38.36 --> 00:13:41.88
Both the first and second Marine divisions were less than half strength.

108
00:13:43.08 --> 00:13:48.60
The Corps would need to draw men from guard detachments, ships, companies, and posts and

109
00:13:48.60 --> 00:13:53.88
stations throughout the world. But it still wouldn't find enough troops to fill a division.

110
00:13:55.48 --> 00:14:00.28
President Truman thus authorized the common honor of the Marine Corps to call up the reserves.

111
00:14:02.92 --> 00:14:11.08
So it was again this is a warning. As a nation and as an individual human,

112
00:14:11.08 --> 00:14:20.28
don't let down your guard. Peace time will not last. And the weaker you look, the sooner

113
00:14:21.32 --> 00:14:28.44
the peace time will end. Now they get the orders stand by to ship out.

114
00:14:30.60 --> 00:14:35.56
On the Saturday evening before we left Camp Lijoon, Dorothy. So that's Joe's wife, Dorothy hired a

115
00:14:35.56 --> 00:14:40.60
babysitter and we went to the officers club for dinner. There were candles out of our table

116
00:14:40.60 --> 00:14:46.20
which was covered in white linen and set with heavy silverware. The food was delicious and

117
00:14:46.20 --> 00:14:53.16
plentiful and I would think about it often in Korea when my men and I were hungry and cold.

118
00:14:54.84 --> 00:15:01.16
That night Dorothy's hair glissoned like gold in the candlelight and her eyes smiled bright and blue

119
00:15:01.16 --> 00:15:07.000
and warm. We danced and laughed with the other latinants and their wives.

120
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:15.32
For some of the couples, our closest friends, it was the last night they would ever have together.

121
00:15:19.40 --> 00:15:28.60
So they depart Lijoon and they show up at Camp Pendleton California and they get to camp

122
00:15:28.60 --> 00:15:37.48
Pendleton. We'll talk more about this but Camp Pendleton is a belief in an aunt's on the coast of

123
00:15:37.48 --> 00:15:44.52
California and there's some pretty aggressive hills in Camp Pendleton which I've spent many

124
00:15:44.52 --> 00:15:52.36
nights on because we would work up there and they can turn some soft men into some hard men

125
00:15:52.36 --> 00:15:58.92
pretty quickly or break men if they're too weak. So back to the book our ranks were filled

126
00:15:58.92 --> 00:16:03.16
by 215 men and seven officers who had never before served together.

127
00:16:04.28 --> 00:16:09.08
Half of our enlisted men were infantry trained regulars. The other half were a service, most of

128
00:16:09.08 --> 00:16:14.60
whom were youngsters who knew new little of marine infantry and its method methods.

129
00:16:15.56 --> 00:16:22.20
Five weeks after we first formed up a camp Pendleton we went into the attack against North Korean

130
00:16:22.20 --> 00:16:29.96
soldiers who were dug into a hill north of Seoul and we had spent half of that time on board ship

131
00:16:30.20 --> 00:16:35.24
on the way to war. So let me break that down to you. They have five weeks or five weeks from when they

132
00:16:35.24 --> 00:16:43.08
form up. Five weeks later they're attacking North Korean troops. So just FYI for a seal platoon that's

133
00:16:43.08 --> 00:16:49.56
going to Iraq we used to work up for a full year. This is after we went through seal training and

134
00:16:49.56 --> 00:16:53.32
after we went through seal qualification training and after all the guys show up the team and go

135
00:16:53.32 --> 00:16:57.08
to special schools and then you get formed up into a platoon and you have an unbelievable work

136
00:16:57.08 --> 00:17:01.08
up to prepare and the Marine Corps does this too. I mean the army everyone does this now.

137
00:17:02.12 --> 00:17:06.44
That's the amount of preparation that it takes to prepare for combat. And here are these guys

138
00:17:06.44 --> 00:17:12.20
five weeks of which what was it. Half that time is spent on a ship just sailing over there.

139
00:17:12.20 --> 00:17:24.12
Hmm unbelievable. Back to the book the sun scorched hills of Camp Pendleton had over the years

140
00:17:24.12 --> 00:17:29.08
toughened the legs and tested the spirits of thousands of America's best fighting men.

141
00:17:30.60 --> 00:17:36.84
One of those towering hills loomed across the road from our training site. So again you want to get

142
00:17:36.84 --> 00:17:44.92
tough. Get on some hills with a rock sack on your back. That will do it to you. And I guess I kind

143
00:17:44.92 --> 00:17:51.80
of included those little sections about Camp Pendleton hills for my own pleasure thinking about

144
00:17:51.80 --> 00:18:00.44
those hills. Back to the book they're going through the training and they're getting ready to

145
00:18:00.44 --> 00:18:07.48
deploy and we'll go back to the book now Dorothy took 75 dollars of our scant resources and bought

146
00:18:07.48 --> 00:18:14.52
an airline ticket from Syracuse to San Diego. Each night after we had dismissed the troops,

147
00:18:14.52 --> 00:18:20.92
Bill and I this is Bill Graber he's another one of the officers. Bill and I caught a ride to the hotel.

148
00:18:22.04 --> 00:18:26.84
Restaurants in the little village of San Clemente were closed that late but Dorothy would have

149
00:18:26.84 --> 00:18:31.96
a cold supper waiting for me. Then we would stroll to the beach and listen to the waves crash

150
00:18:31.96 --> 00:18:39.08
across the sand. During those walks we talked about the babies and we made plans for my return from

151
00:18:39.08 --> 00:18:44.52
Korea. My next assignment I assure her would give us at least two years at a good duty station.

152
00:18:45.40 --> 00:18:51.16
Maybe I would be seeing your enough for us to rate decent quarters. In the mornings,

153
00:18:51.16 --> 00:18:57.32
early and still dark Bill Graber and I would grab a ride back to Camp with the other officers.

154
00:18:58.44 --> 00:19:03.32
Everyone except the drivers slept all the way crowded against each other and the tight seats of the

155
00:19:03.32 --> 00:19:10.76
car. We were very tired but we were young men and we did dearly love our beautiful wives.

156
00:19:13.32 --> 00:19:19.16
And you're going to see throughout this book that even though his wife was not with him,

157
00:19:19.16 --> 00:19:28.60
she was with him the whole time. Like many spouses are when guys are deployed overseas and now

158
00:19:28.60 --> 00:19:34.84
they are on board the ship. The ship is getting ready to pull out the San Diego bay.

159
00:19:37.08 --> 00:19:41.72
Back to the book the wives remained on the dock long after we had gone aboard.

160
00:19:41.72 --> 00:19:49.96
The squirrel of bagpipe sounded as we wave to them. PFC Timmy Kaleen, Abel Company stood on the

161
00:19:49.96 --> 00:19:58.76
fan tail of the Oken Augen and his bagpipes filled the fading afternoon with the marines him.

162
00:20:00.12 --> 00:20:05.56
Hanker chips fluttered from the dock and the ship's horn blasted. We were underway.

163
00:20:05.56 --> 00:20:13.80
There were tears but marines and marines wives aren't ashamed of tears when their him plays.

164
00:20:19.48 --> 00:20:26.36
So now they're heading over to Korea. They're in cramped quarters. I've done a couple

165
00:20:27.48 --> 00:20:32.76
deployments on board ships and there's amphibious ships is what they're called and these ships

166
00:20:32.76 --> 00:20:38.44
were meant to take people overseas. The ones that I deployed on were what drove us,

167
00:20:38.44 --> 00:20:43.32
what drove soldiers to Vietnam. We used to deploy on those ships for six months but it's just

168
00:20:43.32 --> 00:20:47.88
really cramped. They're basically basically like a cattle car, a giant cattle car, a cattle ship.

169
00:20:47.88 --> 00:20:54.36
Then they just pack everyone on there. It's really tight and there's not much to do on there.

170
00:20:54.36 --> 00:20:58.04
But you know you take a bunch of marines you put them on a ship and they figure something out

171
00:20:58.04 --> 00:21:03.88
back to the book. Staff Sergeant Richard revealed himself to be an all-purpose NCO and an acquisition

172
00:21:03.88 --> 00:21:10.36
specialist. One day he produced a set of boxing gloves and the men of Baker 17 immediately

173
00:21:10.36 --> 00:21:18.60
became avid pugilists. For three exuberant rounds to the delight of the company, the little bull

174
00:21:18.60 --> 00:21:28.52
bifolk and the little gorilla, Lupachini, engaged in mutual annihilation. When Sergeant Richard

175
00:21:28.52 --> 00:21:32.84
claimed his mask gear to end the brawl, the troops and much of the ships crew were an

176
00:21:32.84 --> 00:21:39.08
cheering frenzy and it had been a grand fight. Both men were covered in blood and bruises and at

177
00:21:39.08 --> 00:21:45.48
the final claim, they wrapped arms and leaned against each other exhausted. My mortar men swarmed

178
00:21:45.48 --> 00:21:51.72
into the square, pummeling bifolk with congratulations, perkins who had been holding bifolks

179
00:21:51.72 --> 00:21:58.84
glasses, placed them carefully over his swollen eyes. I saw Burris then gently guide bifolk out of

180
00:21:58.84 --> 00:22:05.16
the ring, Gino Brian, Lupachini's platoon sergeant followed with his man and Baker 17 was still

181
00:22:05.16 --> 00:22:09.80
whistling and cheering when the two fighters and their handlers went through the hatch and down the

182
00:22:09.80 --> 00:22:19.48
ladder to sick bay. Joe Kersaba stood next to me, so Joe Kersaba is one of the platoon commanders

183
00:22:20.52 --> 00:22:26.84
stood next to me. This outfit is coming together. He said Joe rarely smiled but there was a big grin on

184
00:22:26.84 --> 00:22:35.88
his face after that fight. So there's, you notice that in these stories about combat wrestling,

185
00:22:35.88 --> 00:22:43.40
fighting boxing, there is something to it. There is something to it that bonds men together.

186
00:22:44.68 --> 00:22:52.76
Fact. Back to the book. When we weren't on deck with the troops, the officers spent the waking

187
00:22:52.76 --> 00:22:57.64
hours around the wardrobe table. So the wardrobe on a ship is where the officers eat. Captain

188
00:22:57.64 --> 00:23:04.12
Wilcox, now the introduction to Captain Wilcox, he's the company commander and he's a vet from

189
00:23:04.12 --> 00:23:10.44
Ewo Jima. Captain Wilcox, let us in review of the principles and lessons of the rifle company combat.

190
00:23:11.40 --> 00:23:18.68
He and Joe Kersaba use their own battle experience as experiences as illustration. They focused on the

191
00:23:18.68 --> 00:23:25.48
chaos of combat and how the best laid plans always disintegrated under enemy fire.

192
00:23:27.48 --> 00:23:34.04
That's why we got to keep our plans simple. War is hell, Captain Wilcox, who had

193
00:23:34.04 --> 00:23:41.48
much experience at it would tell us, but you never know what particular kind of hell it is going to be.

194
00:23:44.12 --> 00:23:48.60
We studied the after-actions report that had come from the fifth Marines, the North Koreans,

195
00:23:48.60 --> 00:23:53.88
they had faced were tough, skilled fighters, every bit as tenacious in battle as the Japanese had

196
00:23:53.88 --> 00:24:00.28
been in the bitter Pacific Island fighting of the last war. The red soldiers, fifth Marines called

197
00:24:00.28 --> 00:24:06.12
them Gooks were well trained in the Russian style of combat with effective use of supporting armor,

198
00:24:06.12 --> 00:24:14.20
mortars and artillery. They were men who also were adept at night fighting. Fighting at night was

199
00:24:14.20 --> 00:24:21.48
a combat skill we had yet to learn. We would do so under fire and at a terrible cost.

200
00:24:21.48 --> 00:24:31.40
Joe Owen is actually not a platoon commander. He's the mortar section commander. In a company

201
00:24:31.40 --> 00:24:39.64
of call it 200, 200 Marines, there's multiple rifle platoons, maybe 40 guys, 50 guys,

202
00:24:39.64 --> 00:24:44.28
and each one of those rifle platoons. Then there's a little section of mortar guys and mortars

203
00:24:44.28 --> 00:24:48.52
aren't in direct fire weapons. For those of you that don't know anything about mortars, mortars,

204
00:24:48.52 --> 00:24:53.88
shoot rounds, you see them in movies, they're a tube. They're basically a tube and they're at a

205
00:24:53.88 --> 00:24:59.56
really high angle and you drop rounds into it and they fire at a very high altitude and high angle

206
00:24:59.56 --> 00:25:05.72
and then they drop down from straight above and hit targets. Joe Owen in this company is in

207
00:25:05.72 --> 00:25:14.76
charge of the mortar section. Back to the book, when Baker 17 was still on the way to war,

208
00:25:14.76 --> 00:25:20.52
the first and fifth Marines forced a landing across the title flats at Inchon Harbor.

209
00:25:21.56 --> 00:25:27.72
The radio in the ship's wardrobe was tuned to the tactical net and we listened to commanders

210
00:25:27.72 --> 00:25:34.04
on the beach as they reported the action to their senior echelons and made call for air and artillery

211
00:25:34.04 --> 00:25:41.96
support and ammunition resupply. Over the static and crackling transmission we could hear

212
00:25:41.96 --> 00:25:48.36
shells exploding, small arms fire, battlefield curses and the screams of wounded men.

213
00:25:49.96 --> 00:25:54.84
The transmissions were piped out onto the deck where the troops also listened to the grim sounds.

214
00:25:56.44 --> 00:26:03.32
I left the wardrobe and went out to be with my mortar men. They sat in a tight cluster staring

215
00:26:03.32 --> 00:26:16.44
intently at a loudspeaker as they heard the war that was about to swallow us. That's a real introduction

216
00:26:16.44 --> 00:26:20.68
right there. You know you're going to war and you get to listen to guys on the ground and

217
00:26:20.68 --> 00:26:27.48
the fierce fire fighting here, the shouts and screams of the wounded. That's a reality. That's a reality

218
00:26:27.48 --> 00:26:37.80
check right there for those guys. At this point, oh when he kind of wants to pick up a platoon instead

219
00:26:37.80 --> 00:26:41.80
of being the mortar section he kind of feels like mortar section. There's a little bit in the rear

220
00:26:41.80 --> 00:26:46.28
and he wants to be a rifle tuned commander. If you remember what Mack Allen said,

221
00:26:46.84 --> 00:26:51.48
the last book we did about the Korean War and rifle tuned commander rifle tuned commander,

222
00:26:51.48 --> 00:26:55.24
rifle tuned commander. That's what if you're gung-ho, that's what you want to do.

223
00:26:55.24 --> 00:27:00.84
And so Joe Owen he feels kind of like, you know, I wish I was a platoon commander. That's what I want

224
00:27:00.84 --> 00:27:06.52
to do. But he's a mortar section commander. Okay. That's fine. Well he tries to get that job.

225
00:27:07.72 --> 00:27:12.92
And he says, he's kind of pressing to get that job up the chain of command. I should have

226
00:27:12.92 --> 00:27:16.92
backed off. I plowed on. Sir, the word is that the first and fifth Marines are running short

227
00:27:16.92 --> 00:27:23.16
on Nutenits. I'd like to request transfer as a replacement. The captain turned to Cainy first sergeant.

228
00:27:23.16 --> 00:27:30.36
If you'll excuse us, I'd like a war to loan with Nutenit Owen. Yes, sir, responded Cainy. So kind of

229
00:27:30.36 --> 00:27:35.80
gets rid of the senior listed guy. He knew I was about to get reamed and he smirked it me as he

230
00:27:35.80 --> 00:27:42.44
disappeared behind the pile of crates. Captain Wilcox gave me that glare once again. You want to

231
00:27:42.44 --> 00:27:47.64
transfer out a baker one seven? Sir, it's the, it's only that I want to put my training

232
00:27:47.64 --> 00:27:53.48
as some use before the fighting ends. And to hell with your men. To hell with the company. Is that right,

233
00:27:53.48 --> 00:27:59.80
Nutenit? No, sir, Captain. It's just that it's just that you want to jump ship on us. The skippers face

234
00:27:59.80 --> 00:28:06.36
glistened with press perspiration and he turned into a steaming red. He'd been angry with me before,

235
00:28:06.36 --> 00:28:11.16
but never like this. Sir, I, okay, Nutenit. Here's what you do. You put your request for transfer

236
00:28:11.16 --> 00:28:16.12
and writing and I'll forward it. Approved. No sense holding back a gung-ho hot shot. The second

237
00:28:16.12 --> 00:28:20.84
lieutenant. Sir, it's not that I want to leave the outfit. It's just that I, I thought that put

238
00:28:20.84 --> 00:28:29.08
your request in writing. That's all lieutenant dismissed. Sir, I dismissed. So this is your typical,

239
00:28:29.08 --> 00:28:33.72
typical meatball that thinks he's going to, you know, he's just being gung-ho, trying to make

240
00:28:33.72 --> 00:28:39.48
something happen. Yeah, it's not a, not a good way to be. And you can see that. So that's another

241
00:28:39.48 --> 00:28:42.44
thing. You got to think about other people's perspective, right? You got to think about your

242
00:28:42.44 --> 00:28:46.60
boss's perspective. Your boss is sitting here trying to get this company together and then

243
00:28:46.60 --> 00:28:50.28
one of his section leaders go, hello, what goes in the world? Right, right. Kind of for him,

244
00:28:50.28 --> 00:28:55.40
so what is meatball? Meatball. Oh, sorry, that's just an expression for, it's an expression for a

245
00:28:55.40 --> 00:29:01.80
new guy in the sea old teams. Oh, no. Meatball or meat stick or FNG. Anyone of those can be utilized

246
00:29:01.80 --> 00:29:07.88
to defend. So I guess I threw it on on the, the new guy here. It kind of slipped out. Yeah, okay.

247
00:29:07.88 --> 00:29:17.88
Okay. Now they get on shore and back to the book, we passed a company of third

248
00:29:17.88 --> 00:29:23.64
battalion that had been pulled off the line. It's men were sprawled along the road, unshaven

249
00:29:23.64 --> 00:29:30.04
and ragged, we read by days of fighting. So there's another, another little wake-up call

250
00:29:30.04 --> 00:29:38.68
seeing the guys that are coming off the line. Now they get into a position, this is Baker 6,

251
00:29:38.68 --> 00:29:43.96
move forward out, Captain Will Cox ordered when we all reported ready. As we started across

252
00:29:43.96 --> 00:29:48.92
the bean field, we were greeted by a few salot of flacking sounds, North Korean bullets

253
00:29:48.92 --> 00:29:54.36
tearing through the bean plants. Flock, fack, fack, all around us. I kept an eye on my men.

254
00:29:54.36 --> 00:29:58.44
They crouch low, but they stayed together and moved ahead. Then the cry,

255
00:29:58.44 --> 00:30:03.64
I call him and God, I'm hit. A few feet from me. A marine from Kaiser's platoon

256
00:30:03.64 --> 00:30:09.000
arrived on the ground. His hands clutching his belly. Grayish red and testins pushed through

257
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.88
his fingers and blood, staying the ground as he thrashed about screaming in his pain and terror.

258
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.60
For the first time, I felt the shivers of dread, the awful fear that comes with combat.

259
00:30:20.60 --> 00:30:30.52
I froze a second. How many seconds? Until I once again became aware of the flacking sounds

260
00:30:30.52 --> 00:30:36.28
in the bean plants and I yelled at the men, move it, you people keep moving. They bent lower

261
00:30:36.28 --> 00:30:43.72
to the ground as we went forward. The North Korean mortars came. Spouts of earth and black smoke

262
00:30:43.72 --> 00:30:50.04
leaped about us, laced with flame and screaming shrapnel. Believes from being plants spawned

263
00:30:50.04 --> 00:30:56.28
in fluries and the ground shook. I was suddenly in the midst of a frenzy storm of noise.

264
00:30:56.28 --> 00:31:01.80
Mortars whistled and crashed, bullets wind and leaves, thwacked, men shouted prayers and blasts

265
00:31:01.80 --> 00:31:08.92
from me. The far end of the bean field was the deck of a rice patty. We headed for its cover.

266
00:31:08.92 --> 00:31:13.48
A string of mortar shells exploded around us and a man threw himself to the ground, kicking and

267
00:31:13.48 --> 00:31:18.84
screaming, can't take this, I can't take this! Screech the fear-stricken marine,

268
00:31:18.84 --> 00:31:24.44
then he curled up himself into a fetal ball. I ran to him and prodded him with a button my

269
00:31:24.44 --> 00:31:29.88
car bean. On your feet, his head was buried in his arms. Can't take this, he wailed.

270
00:31:30.44 --> 00:31:36.36
Get up or I'll shoot you. The sound of the words coming from my mouth was unreal to me.

271
00:31:37.16 --> 00:31:43.48
Jesus, don't shoot me the man wind. Tears cut pale streaks through the dust on his cheeks as he

272
00:31:43.48 --> 00:31:49.24
stared and horror at my car bean, which was inches from his face. I grabbed a man by his collar

273
00:31:49.24 --> 00:31:55.08
and pulled him up to his feet. Move, I yelled. Sergeant Dale from the first patoon ran toward us.

274
00:31:55.08 --> 00:32:01.64
I got him, lieutenant. He's from my patoon. Dale said. So there's fear.

275
00:32:02.84 --> 00:32:08.28
Then you can see Joho in his feeling fear and he's dealing with it. And this other young

276
00:32:08.28 --> 00:32:14.12
marine is feeling fear and he's not dealing with it. Then they they finally get to that

277
00:32:14.12 --> 00:32:18.52
dieker cross the field. Back to the book, I crawled up the diek to peer over the top.

278
00:32:18.52 --> 00:32:22.84
Smoke obscured my view, but far ahead and across the road I detected some movement.

279
00:32:23.96 --> 00:32:27.96
The enemy positions were difficult to locate. No flash came from their weapons when they

280
00:32:27.96 --> 00:32:33.72
fired. I raised my binoculars. Before I could focus on the target, however, a flurry of bullets

281
00:32:33.72 --> 00:32:39.48
melted the diek and spurts of pebbles and dirt stung my face. I jerked my head back down and

282
00:32:39.48 --> 00:32:46.20
to cover. Besides me, a rifleman tumbled away from the diek. He made a choking sound and his helmet

283
00:32:46.20 --> 00:32:51.48
bounced to the ground. Blood gushed from his head, which suddenly became a wet crimson pulp.

284
00:32:53.16 --> 00:33:00.04
Another wave of fear shuddered through me, a massive paralyzing force. Again, I froze,

285
00:33:00.04 --> 00:33:07.16
aware only of that blood drenched face and head. Captain Wilcox voiced cracking,

286
00:33:07.16 --> 00:33:10.60
crackled out of my walkie-talkie. Baker five, this is six, come in.

287
00:33:11.40 --> 00:33:16.12
The voice snapped me from my paralysis. Baker six, this is five, come in six.

288
00:33:17.40 --> 00:33:22.68
I was scrambling back up the diek. I knew the skipper wanted the 60s, the 60s are his mortar,

289
00:33:22.68 --> 00:33:28.12
60mm mortars, to bear on the North Koreans who had us under fire. Get those guns cranked up,

290
00:33:28.12 --> 00:33:34.36
five over. Roger that six, I said to the radio on the double. Surged at wingets, gun was a

291
00:33:34.36 --> 00:33:38.92
few yards away behind the diek and I crawled over to get in front of it. Stand by for H.E. Fire

292
00:33:38.92 --> 00:33:43.96
Mission, I called the winget. Number one gun standing by H.E. Fire Mission, the staunch winget

293
00:33:43.96 --> 00:33:49.40
called back. With all the will I could muster, I forced my head above the diek by noculers at the

294
00:33:49.40 --> 00:33:55.72
ready. The terror of having my head blown off to a pulp was diminished by fear of losing the

295
00:33:55.72 --> 00:34:05.88
respect of my men. So there's a couple things there. You've heard me say, you train how you fight.

296
00:34:05.88 --> 00:34:11.40
What they go back to is the fundamentals that they practice and trained and we didn't

297
00:34:11.40 --> 00:34:16.76
dive too much in the training. But if you ever, if you've ever seen Marines in the field with

298
00:34:16.76 --> 00:34:20.44
a 60mm mortar, I haven't seen Army guys, I'm sure they're outstanding too, but when you see the

299
00:34:20.44 --> 00:34:25.88
Marines setting up a mortar for a fire mission, it's beautiful. It's a beautiful thing. And this is

300
00:34:25.88 --> 00:34:32.68
exactly what it's like even in the 90s, you know, 40 years after after the Korean War, when I

301
00:34:32.68 --> 00:34:37.24
would watch the the mortarman set up a mortar to shoot, it was just like that. They'd be stand by

302
00:34:37.24 --> 00:34:41.96
for fire mission and then, you know, one of the sergeant would call out. Number one gun standing by

303
00:34:41.96 --> 00:34:48.04
H.E. Fire Mission, you go back to your training and those fundamental basics that you learn,

304
00:34:48.04 --> 00:34:55.24
the simple commands, that's what you go back to. That's why you train. That's why you use repetition.

305
00:34:55.96 --> 00:35:01.88
So when that fear comes up, you go back to what you know. Your instinct becomes instead of

306
00:35:01.88 --> 00:35:09.32
cowering, your instinct becomes to do what you've trained out of do. Back to the book,

307
00:35:09.32 --> 00:35:14.36
all along the Dykes, our Marines were sprawled heads below the edge. The corpsmen had moved

308
00:35:14.36 --> 00:35:19.56
their wounded alongside the road waiting for the ambulance jeeps, the meat wagons to come up.

309
00:35:20.28 --> 00:35:26.76
There were two bodies face covered by ponchos. They were Baker one sevens first killed an action,

310
00:35:26.76 --> 00:35:35.32
the KIA's, Baker's the company at the right. That's why they keep referring to Baker one seven,

311
00:35:35.32 --> 00:35:40.68
first battalion, Baker company. Back to the book, someone said,

312
00:35:40.68 --> 00:35:47.000
it won't be nothing left up there by the time the artillery gets it. So what's going on here is

313
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.36
they call in some some big guns, some big so a 60 millimeter more small and when you start calling in,

314
00:35:52.36 --> 00:35:59.40
how it serves big giant bombs are coming from the sky. That's what they call some of those in.

315
00:36:00.28 --> 00:36:04.52
And you know, you're sitting there watching the mountain where these, where these North Koreans are,

316
00:36:04.52 --> 00:36:10.84
they're seeing massive explosions. And so now back to the book, someone said, won't be nothing left

317
00:36:10.84 --> 00:36:16.04
of them up there by the time that artillery lets up. Staff Sergeant Richard the company armor

318
00:36:16.04 --> 00:36:21.56
was crouched near us. Don't fool yourself. He said artillery never wipes out the gooks,

319
00:36:21.56 --> 00:36:27.88
softens them up and keeps their head down. But they'll be there waiting when the guns let up.

320
00:36:28.92 --> 00:36:34.12
There's another lesson we learned a lot about. You know, you think you think that's no

321
00:36:34.12 --> 00:36:40.76
one could survive something and they do survive it. When we were running training, we had

322
00:36:41.80 --> 00:36:45.96
the humvies were shooting blanks. It's training. So the humvies would be big 50 caliber

323
00:36:45.96 --> 00:36:50.28
machine guns and they'd shoot blanks into a building and then the guys in the building would

324
00:36:50.28 --> 00:36:53.72
come and shoot back at them. And the guys going through the training, the seals,

325
00:36:53.72 --> 00:36:58.44
they'll, you know, we shot a bunch of 50 cowl in there. Those guys wouldn't be alive. And you know,

326
00:36:58.44 --> 00:37:05.24
I would say no, actually they will be alive. They will be alive because I've seen it. And those 50

327
00:37:05.24 --> 00:37:10.20
cows, they're on awesome weapon. But there's a guy, two rooms deep inside that building. You can

328
00:37:10.20 --> 00:37:13.88
shoot all those rounds in there. He's going to be okay. And as soon as you let up, he's going to be

329
00:37:13.88 --> 00:37:17.56
there shooting back at units. The same thing with obviously with the big artillery and the North

330
00:37:17.56 --> 00:37:26.44
Koreans are dug in. I scrambled to my feet. Keep moving. The men were all up and they ran after me

331
00:37:26.44 --> 00:37:30.60
bent under the weight of their guns and ammo. Get us the hell out of here. Someone cried.

332
00:37:31.80 --> 00:37:35.88
And so what do they do? They attack. So when you're pinned down, it's just another example.

333
00:37:35.88 --> 00:37:40.44
When you're pinned down attack. And here's what it looks like. Back to the book. Two of Kaiser

334
00:37:40.44 --> 00:37:44.60
Squads moved up and short bounds while a third laid a base of fire.

335
00:37:47.88 --> 00:37:51.64
Covered move. You're going to see cover move all throughout this book. And every time we bring it

336
00:37:51.64 --> 00:37:55.40
up, I'm going to mention it. Because I want to make sure everyone that's listening, those those

337
00:37:55.40 --> 00:38:00.12
folks that are in the military, you hear it every single time. This is the first one of many.

338
00:38:00.12 --> 00:38:05.32
Two of Kaiser Squads moved up and short bounds while a third laid a base of fire. The first 50 yards

339
00:38:05.32 --> 00:38:11.16
went easily. Then the North Koreans popped out of cover and took us under fire. Suddenly the ground

340
00:38:11.16 --> 00:38:16.36
before us was scared with torrents of bullets. Mortar shells whistled in and exploded along

341
00:38:16.36 --> 00:38:23.64
Koyzer's line. Carmen. Carmen. So if you don't know, Carmen is a medic in the army, it's a

342
00:38:23.64 --> 00:38:30.12
medic in the Navy. It's called a corpsman and navy corpsmen are the ones that go and deploy

343
00:38:30.12 --> 00:38:34.92
with the Marine Corps as medics. So that's when you hear those corpsmen calls, that's what it is.

344
00:38:35.80 --> 00:38:41.16
Carmen. Carmen came a despairing whale. Ad topple, lurched up from prone position and ran

345
00:38:41.16 --> 00:38:46.44
toward the wounded man as enemy bullets spurred it around him. Besides me, another man went down

346
00:38:46.44 --> 00:38:53.96
with a grunt and did not move. Fear slammed my gut once more and I was flat on the deck.

347
00:38:54.84 --> 00:39:01.08
Nichols was down there with me. What do you want to do, Lieutenant? Nichols plump young

348
00:39:01.08 --> 00:39:07.32
face, streaked with dirt and sweat, showed the same fear that had me in its terrible grip.

349
00:39:07.32 --> 00:39:19.80
Jesus, the boy depends on me. I forced my head up. That's a classic. What do you want to do,

350
00:39:19.80 --> 00:39:28.60
Lieutenant? I was, I think I might have talked about this, but I was in, when I was in Sri Lanka

351
00:39:28.60 --> 00:39:32.68
and I was a young kid and there was all those guys that were hardcore combat veterans.

352
00:39:32.68 --> 00:39:40.20
And one of the captains, Army captains, again Sri Lankan Army captain who had been in tons of combat.

353
00:39:40.20 --> 00:39:45.08
And I was talking to him, I was trying to like, gunner information about war because I hadn't been

354
00:39:45.08 --> 00:39:53.16
in any and he'd been in a ton. He was a wounded and trapped on his face and I'm talking to him,

355
00:39:53.16 --> 00:40:00.28
you know about it and he said, you know, when you're in a war, it was it's pretty easy

356
00:40:00.28 --> 00:40:05.16
to take care of yourself. Take care of yourself. Like, he said, if I was in a war,

357
00:40:05.16 --> 00:40:08.60
if I, when we were in a fire fight, if I just had to take care of myself, I'd be okay.

358
00:40:09.88 --> 00:40:14.76
But when you're in charge of everyone, it's totally different. Then now, the sudden,

359
00:40:14.76 --> 00:40:21.96
you got people saying, what do you want us to do, Lieutenant? And that's the pressure, which I will never

360
00:40:21.96 --> 00:40:26.12
forget him, tell me that story. And that's a great example of it right there. Sure, he's scared.

361
00:40:26.12 --> 00:40:32.28
He's scared, but he's got a mortar section waiting for him to wait for him to tell him what to do,

362
00:40:32.28 --> 00:40:42.60
to save them. Now we get introduced to a guy named Lieutenant Lee, who's a Chinese American guy,

363
00:40:43.64 --> 00:40:49.16
very by the book and very hardcore. You're gonna hear play about Lieutenant Lee here. Lieutenant Lee

364
00:40:49.16 --> 00:40:53.88
came upon Baldwin's gun. Sir, I think we should move this gun Baldwin said to his Lieutenant.

365
00:40:53.88 --> 00:40:57.80
It's kicking up dust. You have a good position here Baldwin, responded Lieutenant Lee.

366
00:40:57.80 --> 00:41:01.64
I'll show you how to handle the dust problem. Lee opened up his canteen and walked around the

367
00:41:01.64 --> 00:41:07.32
machine gun sprinkling precious water as he went. Now fire off a burst orderedly. The machine gun

368
00:41:07.32 --> 00:41:14.36
fired, but Ray's no dust. Lieutenant Lee walked on up the hill, ignoring enemy bullets that hit

369
00:41:14.36 --> 00:41:23.24
around him. Moving forward a little bit. Hey, Lee, called by folk. Get down. We're getting shot at.

370
00:41:24.04 --> 00:41:29.24
By folk had Lieutenant Lee's attention. Lieutenant dashed to where by folk was hugging the ground.

371
00:41:29.24 --> 00:41:35.24
You addressed me as Lee. He asked, standing over the astonished young marine.

372
00:41:35.24 --> 00:41:38.84
Jesus, yeah, get down. You're drawing fire. You on your feet,

373
00:41:38.84 --> 00:41:44.36
demanded Lee. Bullets sit through the air, punctuating the bizarre scene of a lieutenant bracing a

374
00:41:44.36 --> 00:41:51.56
PFC to attention in the midst of a fire fight. You call me Lieutenant Lee or Sir. You understand

375
00:41:51.56 --> 00:41:59.64
that marine? Yes, yes, sir. Stamored by folk, wishing that he were in a very deep foxhole.

376
00:42:00.04 --> 00:42:05.32
And you never forget that. Understand? Now carry on. Said the Lieutenant and he proceeded to walk

377
00:42:05.32 --> 00:42:11.88
further up the hill, seemingly oblivious to the enemy fire. What the hell? I thought by folk.

378
00:42:13.24 --> 00:42:20.52
And he got up to walk behind Lee. The rest of the mortar squad arose and followed. So like I said,

379
00:42:20.52 --> 00:42:27.24
Lee is by the book. And that's an extreme example. I don't think I necessarily agree with that

380
00:42:27.24 --> 00:42:34.92
example either. But Lee's gonna hold the line. And maybe there was much danger as he thought. But

381
00:42:35.72 --> 00:42:43.72
instilling that discipline, he's given no slack. Back to the book, while the mortar is

382
00:42:43.72 --> 00:42:50.60
obscured the enemy's view, Van Winkle moved his people up. So you got the mortar's dropping fire

383
00:42:50.60 --> 00:42:54.44
and that allows Van Winkle to move his people. That's called cover and moved by the way.

384
00:42:54.44 --> 00:42:59.32
Nearing the top of the ravine, Hank Kaiser positioned his assault squad to follow a barrage of

385
00:42:59.32 --> 00:43:04.92
grenades into the enemy positions as soon as the mortar's lifted. So you got three situations. You

386
00:43:04.92 --> 00:43:08.68
got the mortar's are going in. That's the first cover. Then once the mortar's lifted, they're going to

387
00:43:08.68 --> 00:43:14.60
throw grenades. That's your second cover. Bam, carriers for the marine machine guns,

388
00:43:14.60 --> 00:43:19.48
filled in with riflemen on the line of assault, ready to charge up the last few yards of ground.

389
00:43:19.48 --> 00:43:26.12
Lee was with them, Van at fix to the top of his car bean. The mortar's fired a final barrage.

390
00:43:26.12 --> 00:43:30.28
Their explosions were followed by the sharper impact of grenades thrown at enemy holes.

391
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.44
Shouts and war cries swelled from charging Marines who leaped Van at's pointed into the enemy

392
00:43:36.44 --> 00:43:41.24
positions that were dug in along the face of the ridge. Some of the North Koreans stood to fight.

393
00:43:41.24 --> 00:43:46.36
Their Van at's also fixed, but they were cut down. Others scurried over the hill,

394
00:43:46.36 --> 00:43:53.96
many were shot from behind as they tried to escape. We all knew had been a far from perfect

395
00:43:53.96 --> 00:44:01.08
exercise. Some of the men had been slow to respond to direction. Not all of our orders were clear enough

396
00:44:01.08 --> 00:44:08.92
for quick and effective fire and movement. We were fortunate that the enemy had not chosen

397
00:44:08.92 --> 00:44:13.56
a fight to the death defense of this hill as they would have advanced as they would when we

398
00:44:13.56 --> 00:44:20.28
advanced further north. Think about this point, not all of our orders were clear enough

399
00:44:21.64 --> 00:44:26.76
for quick and effective fire and movement. He's not even blaming the guys. He knows that the mistake

400
00:44:26.76 --> 00:44:31.48
was that they weren't being simple clear concise with their orders and that makes everything lag.

401
00:44:34.68 --> 00:44:38.84
Back to the book and we had nearly reached the top captain Wilcox pushed wevers,

402
00:44:38.84 --> 00:44:44.68
platoon through Kaiser's for the final assault. Platoon Sergeant King led the charge and we could

403
00:44:44.68 --> 00:44:52.20
hear his piercing rebel yells all over the hill. Once again, it was a ragged performance. Ors

404
00:44:52.20 --> 00:44:58.36
confused in the hellish noise, men who bunched close together and some who hesitated to risk

405
00:44:58.36 --> 00:45:05.24
the move against enemy fire. However, clumsy we were, though, we had the fundamentals right.

406
00:45:05.24 --> 00:45:12.12
The NCOs directed their sectors of fire. The fire teams went forward in bounds, covering each

407
00:45:12.12 --> 00:45:17.80
other as they progressed and our machine gun and mortar fire stayed ahead of the advance

408
00:45:18.84 --> 00:45:24.60
and kept the enemy heads down. That's what that's what small unit tactics are.

409
00:45:24.60 --> 00:45:27.48
It's cover move, cover move, cover move.

410
00:45:27.48 --> 00:45:38.84
Now, they're digging in some some night defenses and because they're these peaks, I mean,

411
00:45:38.84 --> 00:45:44.04
this huge mountainous terrain steep cliffs, they end up disaggregated across the battlefield.

412
00:45:44.04 --> 00:45:47.80
So they're not, they're not right next to each other because there's valleys between them.

413
00:45:49.96 --> 00:45:54.84
Back to the book, we had to set our own isolated perimeter and we couldn't tie our

414
00:45:54.84 --> 00:45:59.48
flanks to the other companies for mutual support. The same hell true for attack,

415
00:45:59.48 --> 00:46:04.68
almost always the battalion was channeled, channeled into attacking some with one company,

416
00:46:04.68 --> 00:46:11.80
one hill at a time. This sort of isolated fighting made it difficult to communicate with

417
00:46:11.80 --> 00:46:19.40
battalion and other companies. That problem was not solved. Much of the time, we company-level

418
00:46:19.40 --> 00:46:26.04
officers were on our own initiative decentralized command. Just decentralized command. So,

419
00:46:26.04 --> 00:46:30.44
imagine this, you can't talk to battalion. There's a hill that cuts your radio signal. You have

420
00:46:30.44 --> 00:46:34.60
to be, you have to know what the intent is of the operation and you have to be out there ready to

421
00:46:34.60 --> 00:46:38.44
execute on your own to the best of your ability underneath the commanders intent.

422
00:46:41.08 --> 00:46:44.76
Back to the book, I learned how to deflect the fear.

423
00:46:44.76 --> 00:46:52.60
After the first jolt of it, which came with the initial shock of coming under fire,

424
00:46:52.60 --> 00:46:58.12
I would force myself upright and attempt to read the situation before the skippers' boys came

425
00:46:58.12 --> 00:47:03.56
crackling out of the walkie-talkie. Once I had rammed myself into action,

426
00:47:04.76 --> 00:47:10.60
the fear subsided. It never completely went away though. So, people asked this all the time how

427
00:47:10.60 --> 00:47:16.68
we get overcome fear. And what did he do to overcome fear? He forced himself into action.

428
00:47:17.24 --> 00:47:23.72
Didn't wait! You start feeling that fear? Go! Go get up, take a look at that situation,

429
00:47:23.72 --> 00:47:28.68
try and analyze it, and his own clock, what he made for himself, the timer that he made for himself,

430
00:47:28.68 --> 00:47:33.40
was I'm going to, I'm going to assess the situation before the boss calls me. So, that's the time

431
00:47:33.40 --> 00:47:39.24
we put on himself. That forced him into action. So, we say this over and over again. Your afraid

432
00:47:39.24 --> 00:47:48.84
is something, step into it. Take action. Don't wait! Back to the book, there was no deflecting the

433
00:47:48.84 --> 00:47:55.72
confusion that became with every firefight. The will during patterns of noise and grotesque scenes

434
00:47:55.72 --> 00:48:05.32
exploded all around. Men screamed in rage and pain and fear. Swarms of bullets, wind and splattered

435
00:48:05.32 --> 00:48:13.48
close by, the mortars blasted, hurled flames and slices of steel and raised clouds of greasy black smoke.

436
00:48:15.32 --> 00:48:21.24
The sparing voice is yelled, corpsmen and someone would surely call what do we do, lieutenant?

437
00:48:23.16 --> 00:48:28.52
In the turmoil, the officers and sergeants made themselves visible and we shouted orders.

438
00:48:28.52 --> 00:48:35.000
Watch your sector or move up or bear on me or go to machine gun 10 o'clock 300 yards.

439
00:48:36.76 --> 00:48:44.60
We subdued the fear and showed the men that we were in command. And I've talked about this one before

440
00:48:44.60 --> 00:48:47.80
too. I talked all the time about, oh you got to explain to everybody why, you got to explain to

441
00:48:47.80 --> 00:48:51.16
why, you want everyone to be happy, you want people to form the plan with you and you want

442
00:48:51.16 --> 00:48:55.96
to be there, plan you want them to take ownership and then I also say that when you have a critical

443
00:48:55.96 --> 00:49:01.16
situation you have to lead and that's what he's talking about right here, you have to lead and

444
00:49:01.16 --> 00:49:07.16
that's what they do. They would give these to orders, simple, clear, direct orders of what to do in

445
00:49:07.16 --> 00:49:17.24
this situation and show the men that they were in command. Back to the book, we could have

446
00:49:17.24 --> 00:49:22.68
alleviated some of the confusion if our walkie talkies had worked in that as advertised. The

447
00:49:22.68 --> 00:49:27.08
handheld two-way radios were supposed to transmit and receive up to a mile in distance.

448
00:49:28.36 --> 00:49:34.12
We found that they rarely functioned over a hundred yards, never over uneven terrain.

449
00:49:34.12 --> 00:49:37.88
We carried them because they were all we had, but we had little faith in them.

450
00:49:38.60 --> 00:49:44.76
Instead, just like frontline military leadership throughout history, we relied on

451
00:49:44.76 --> 00:49:53.000
line-of-site communications, arm-and-hand signals, and we sent runners back and forth. In those first

452
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:58.68
five days of combat, I learned to stay visible and I learned the value of a good runner.

453
00:49:59.64 --> 00:50:07.08
The North Koreans used a whistles and bugles for battlefield command, more effective by far

454
00:50:07.08 --> 00:50:16.28
than our walkie talkies. I'm a huge proponent of verbal commands. I think life told this story

455
00:50:16.28 --> 00:50:20.28
a bunch of times where I was telling you, you're used, he's trying to tell us guys what to do over

456
00:50:20.28 --> 00:50:26.76
the radio and I said, hey, life, give them verbal commands. When you're working,

457
00:50:26.76 --> 00:50:32.04
there's this everyone's talking on the radio and it turns into white noise. They're not responding.

458
00:50:32.04 --> 00:50:37.48
When you give a verbal command in the Seal Teams and the Military, you get trained

459
00:50:38.20 --> 00:50:43.88
that if I tell Echo, Peel right, you're good at when you hear that, you're instinct and you're

460
00:50:43.88 --> 00:50:46.92
training tells you to repeat that command. So you're in repeat at the next person when they hear,

461
00:50:46.92 --> 00:50:49.64
they're going to repeat it. So everyone repeats the verbal command.

462
00:50:50.68 --> 00:50:54.28
So when you say verbal command, that's like, it's the radio. Yeah, it's yelling,

463
00:50:54.28 --> 00:50:59.08
you have to yell and you're talking, but in all actuality, it's yelling. Yeah, it's yelling.

464
00:50:59.08 --> 00:51:06.44
And so the radios just sometimes, you know, and our radios are infinitely better than these

465
00:51:06.44 --> 00:51:11.08
radios and even while I was in, the radio has made vast improvements and by the end, by the time I

466
00:51:11.08 --> 00:51:17.24
retired, the radios were pretty damn good. But there are times if the radio is not working,

467
00:51:17.24 --> 00:51:21.24
you've got to go with the verbal commands. And that's why you've got to train. You've got to train

468
00:51:21.24 --> 00:51:24.92
for the verbal train without radios a bunch. I always tell guys, yeah, take the radios off.

469
00:51:24.92 --> 00:51:28.44
Make sure you can do without radios. How's it going to go if their communication net goes down?

470
00:51:28.44 --> 00:51:31.000
You've got to have that backup communication plan all the time. Hmm.

471
00:51:37.32 --> 00:51:43.64
Now here we are in another, another firefight. This is basically a massive bulk of fire

472
00:51:43.64 --> 00:51:48.12
fights back to the book. The North Koreans disappeared into the deep ditch that ran along the

473
00:51:48.12 --> 00:51:53.72
other side of the road. They were moving in our direction and we dove for the our own ditch.

474
00:51:53.72 --> 00:51:58.60
Grenades flew toward us but landed wide. There was a machine gun up ahead. However, I couldn't

475
00:51:58.60 --> 00:52:05.000
locate it and it started and it started to fire down on us. I tossed two grenades in the ditch where

476
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:10.92
the North Koreans were concealed and told Burst to have his men crawl up, crawl over a clump of

477
00:52:10.92 --> 00:52:16.84
boulders 20 paces away. When the squad and its mortar were in, I told Nicholas to go for it.

478
00:52:18.20 --> 00:52:23.64
We were crouched together, but Nicholas turned to crawl away a bullet spear

479
00:52:23.64 --> 00:52:29.48
just through him backward against him against me. His blood spattered my dung threes.

480
00:52:30.36 --> 00:52:36.36
The boy made a terrible rattling sound and then was still his teenage face.

481
00:52:37.48 --> 00:52:44.76
Expressionless. Burst watched horrified and I waved him back when he began to crawl towards us.

482
00:52:46.12 --> 00:52:51.56
Then I took a deep breath, pressed myself flat to the ground and crept rapidly away from the ditch.

483
00:52:51.56 --> 00:53:09.16
I left Nicholas behind me where he had died. Harsh firefights and they wrap up this. They keep

484
00:53:09.16 --> 00:53:14.20
taking their objectives. They're taking a lot of casualties and this section here is after the

485
00:53:14.20 --> 00:53:21.32
fight is over back to the book. We grew silent thinking of our families. I took the snap shots from

486
00:53:21.32 --> 00:53:28.36
the webbing inside my helmet and remembered their images one by one. Then I thought about the

487
00:53:28.36 --> 00:53:34.76
days next mission and reviewed the fighting we had done that day. I tried to blank out the blood

488
00:53:34.76 --> 00:53:40.92
screams, men killing each other and dying, the ground exploding, bursts of flame and stabbing

489
00:53:40.92 --> 00:53:48.84
tracers, a hot smell of weapons at full automatic, the stench of guts and feces oozing from a dead

490
00:53:48.84 --> 00:54:11.24
marine and the shuddering fear. They continue pushing, they're pushing north and they're on

491
00:54:11.24 --> 00:54:17.000
one of these patrols heading north and we'll go back to the book through my binoculars. I saw

492
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:22.52
bearded old Korean emerge from one of the huts. Papa's on we called these grandpa's who wore

493
00:54:22.52 --> 00:54:29.88
traditional garb of high black top hat and flowing white robes. The old fellow stood before his

494
00:54:29.88 --> 00:54:34.52
doorway watching the wilderness as weapons laden marines passed through his village.

495
00:54:35.48 --> 00:54:42.84
Crack went brain-ex-carbine, only a few inches from me and the old man felled the ground.

496
00:54:42.84 --> 00:54:51.16
The tall black hat fell beside him. Got the bastard, exclaimed brainic. His carbine was still

497
00:54:51.16 --> 00:54:57.08
up searching for another target. God damn fool, I yelled astonished at the murderous act.

498
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:04.36
Without fought I slammed the butt of my own carbine into brain-ex-rids. Brain-ex-creamed with pain

499
00:55:04.36 --> 00:55:09.56
and went down to the ground writhing. I stood over him, poised to deliver another butt stroke.

500
00:55:09.56 --> 00:55:15.48
Got damn fool, I screamed again as right came from behind me and held my arms, wing it,

501
00:55:15.48 --> 00:55:21.88
was with right and pulled my carbine away. Hold it, lieutenant. Right shouted in my ear, hold it.

502
00:55:21.88 --> 00:55:25.80
What the hell happened? You see what he did, I screamed. I'll kill the

503
00:55:26.76 --> 00:55:32.84
dictorsky. The corpsman was already kneeling beside Brainic. He snapped a thread of morphine

504
00:55:32.84 --> 00:55:40.28
and jabed Brainic's arm. I endeavored to control myself, deep breaths. Okay, sergeant, I said,

505
00:55:40.28 --> 00:55:46.12
and right released his hold, the men were circling looking for me to Brainic. They were silent.

506
00:55:47.16 --> 00:55:52.44
Got damn it. He shot that old man for nothing, I yelled. Through the pain, Brainic,

507
00:55:52.44 --> 00:55:58.04
grown. I thought he was a goddamn gook. I thought he had a weapon. Any of you seen what happened?

508
00:55:58.04 --> 00:56:04.44
Wing it asked the men, no one responded. No witnesses right said softly to me.

509
00:56:04.44 --> 00:56:10.84
Whatever happened, nobody saw anything. The realization hit me. No one except me had witnessed

510
00:56:10.84 --> 00:56:16.12
Brainic shooting that old man. But if someone had seen me hit Brainic, I could be subject to

511
00:56:16.12 --> 00:56:22.44
a court martial for striking and elisted man. No witnesses right said again, no one saw anything.

512
00:56:22.44 --> 00:56:29.08
This stays in the mortars. I heard someone say, meaning we're just going to keep this amongst

513
00:56:29.08 --> 00:56:34.84
ourselves. Yeah, someone else responded. This stays with us. There was a murmur of a scent.

514
00:56:36.20 --> 00:56:41.48
Shall I move them out? Lieutenant, right asked? Yes, sergeant. I answered,

515
00:56:41.48 --> 00:56:48.28
numbly. Move them out. The morphine had not yet taken his effect on Brainic. He ground his

516
00:56:48.28 --> 00:56:53.64
teeth together to hold back cries of pain and he was scared. I bent over him and said,

517
00:56:53.64 --> 00:56:58.60
you know, you and I know what happened, Brainic. And you're going to have to live with it.

518
00:56:59.48 --> 00:57:04.60
Brainic nodded his head. He said nothing but blinked his tear-filled eyes and nodded his head.

519
00:57:05.56 --> 00:57:11.88
Take care of him, doc. Then I went to catch up with the mortarman. When I walked past the old man's

520
00:57:11.88 --> 00:57:18.52
hut, a circle of women and children surrounded the body crying their sorrow. And old woman caught my eye.

521
00:57:19.80 --> 00:57:25.24
I'm sorry. I said, although she wouldn't understand my words, we're all very sorry.

522
00:57:33.32 --> 00:57:40.92
It's madness. And again, you young military leaders out there. You've got to watch your

523
00:57:40.92 --> 00:57:45.72
people and you've got to give them good commanders intent. They've got to understand. They've got to

524
00:57:45.72 --> 00:57:48.44
understand what's right and what's wrong and that's going to come from you.

525
00:57:53.16 --> 00:57:59.88
Now, at this point in the book, and again, obviously, I'm not reading the entire book,

526
00:58:00.60 --> 00:58:05.88
but you all should. So you can capture everything that's in between, but I'm jumping forward a

527
00:58:05.88 --> 00:58:12.52
little bit here. They get relieved by the army. They move to the rear and they start getting

528
00:58:12.52 --> 00:58:18.60
word on what they're going to be doing. Back to the book, under the glare of the lantern,

529
00:58:18.60 --> 00:58:24.60
Captain Wilcox spread a map on the hood and we jostled for a view. Maps to this part of the world

530
00:58:24.60 --> 00:58:31.48
were scarce. This is the first one we had seen of the country beyond Hamhung. It was a topographic

531
00:58:31.48 --> 00:58:36.84
chart made by the Japanese during their occupation of Korea. The characters language on the

532
00:58:36.84 --> 00:58:42.28
map were Japanese, place names and legends had no meaning for us, but we could read the physical

533
00:58:42.28 --> 00:58:49.96
features and the contour lines. The terrain they showed was a military nightmare, roadblock and

534
00:58:49.96 --> 00:58:56.84
ambush territory. It was a country of high steep hills, deep valleys, and sharp ridge lines.

535
00:58:56.84 --> 00:59:03.80
The lower elevations were largely forested. Settlements were sparse, and the few roads

536
00:59:03.80 --> 00:59:11.16
twisted snake-like through tight passes and along riverbeds. At the northern extremity, the map,

537
00:59:11.16 --> 00:59:17.16
at the end of 70 miles of a narrow, corkscrew roadway was a meandering blue dot.

538
00:59:18.60 --> 00:59:24.36
That was the chosen reservoir. The Chinese have committed themselves to this war,

539
00:59:24.36 --> 00:59:31.000
began Captain Wilcox. They are in force. They are slicing through the Republic of North Korea's

540
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:39.24
Army up north like a hot knife through butter. Up here, he used his bandet as a pointer to indicate

541
00:59:39.24 --> 00:59:45.56
the Chinese advance. The people will, we will fight, are the 124th division of the regular

542
00:59:45.56 --> 00:59:52.04
Chinese Army. Definite and confirmed no matter what Tokyo wants to believe. So the military command

543
00:59:52.04 --> 00:59:57.80
was in Japan. They weren't in Korea. The military command, the generals were over in Tokyo.

544
00:59:57.80 --> 01:00:02.36
So he said no matter what Tokyo wants to believe. This is who we're fighting. Back to the

545
01:00:02.36 --> 01:00:08.52
book, their tough, well-trained soldiers, 10,000 of them. And all of their officers are combat

546
01:00:08.52 --> 01:00:15.80
experienced. They're very best. After the briefing, I request a word alone with Captain Wilcox

547
01:00:15.80 --> 01:00:20.52
to ask him if we could leave Sergeant Wright. So Sergeant Wright, you've heard his name

548
01:00:20.52 --> 01:00:25.88
mentioned a few times. He was the senior and listed guy work and directly for Captain O and

549
01:00:27.72 --> 01:00:34.76
and it's actually time for him to go home. I request a word alone with Captain Wilcox to ask him

550
01:00:34.76 --> 01:00:39.40
if we could leave Sergeant Wright behind with the company moved out. Sergeant White has done a

551
01:00:39.40 --> 01:00:44.92
good job for us, but he's a short time or just waiting for paperwork I offered. Further more sir,

552
01:00:44.92 --> 01:00:48.84
it's not good for the troops to see him with his morale down. I'd like to replace him with

553
01:00:48.84 --> 01:00:54.44
Sergeant Winget before we hit anything serious up ahead. Good idea the captain said,

554
01:00:54.44 --> 01:01:01.56
except it's too late. Battalion says we mount out as we are. I'm not about to snarl up with them

555
01:01:01.56 --> 01:01:07.000
on a transfer detail right now. You tell Sergeant Wright that I'm sorry we can't do anything for him.

556
01:01:07.80 --> 01:01:14.60
I, I, sir. So that was a little opportunity for Sergeant Wright to get out of there,

557
01:01:14.60 --> 01:01:26.44
but it didn't work out. And now, just talking about kind of the morale, the troops back to the

558
01:01:26.44 --> 01:01:31.48
book, there was a great energy in the ranks, strong, healthy young men on the way to adventure.

559
01:01:32.36 --> 01:01:37.40
We cleaned and reclaimed weapons and earnestly sharpened our bayonets and fighting knives.

560
01:01:38.84 --> 01:01:44.20
The old salt's retold stories of Japanese ferocity on the Pacific Islands. Others remembered

561
01:01:44.20 --> 01:01:49.32
pitch battle with the Chinese bandits along with the pleasures of the North China occupation.

562
01:01:50.12 --> 01:01:56.04
The newly blooded veterans of last month's fight boasted to the replacements about their

563
01:01:56.04 --> 01:02:01.80
triumphs over the stubborn North Koreans. All hands speculated about whether the quality of the

564
01:02:01.80 --> 01:02:07.48
Chinese army would be equal to that of the North Koreans we had beaten down south. The fear that

565
01:02:07.48 --> 01:02:14.60
settles in the gut before combat had not yet surfaced. On that crisp morning with our clean,

566
01:02:14.60 --> 01:02:23.08
even faces, clean dungries, square-to-way gear, full canteens, full bellies, and full issue of ammunition,

567
01:02:23.08 --> 01:02:30.20
the Marines of Baker 17 feared no one. They started heading up north and one of the

568
01:02:30.20 --> 01:02:35.72
kernels is out. Colonel Litsenberg was there. He stood beside the road as we passed nodding and smiling

569
01:02:35.72 --> 01:02:40.92
at his fighters. You're looking good, Marine. You're looking good, Marine. He kept saying,

570
01:02:40.92 --> 01:02:45.72
and all the men waved and smiled back at him. The veterans from down south were recognized,

571
01:02:45.72 --> 01:02:52.60
all recognized old Homer. They had seen him frequently up on the line. Good hunting, Owen. Good hunting,

572
01:02:52.60 --> 01:02:54.84
young man. He called them me as I passed by.

573
01:02:54.84 --> 01:03:10.36
Now he has that opportunity now to maybe figure out a way out for right, who had the opportunity

574
01:03:10.36 --> 01:03:17.000
go away. While the men were loading up on ammo, I talked to Sergeant Wright. No sense for you

575
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.88
to go up, I told him. Your orders could come down from battalion any time now. Stay here with the

576
01:03:21.88 --> 01:03:28.36
gunning. I appreciate that lieutenant responded Sergeant Wright, but I do want to stay with the

577
01:03:28.36 --> 01:03:35.48
mortars. If it's okay with you, that's what I'll do. I nodded. It's okay with me, Sergeant.

578
01:03:35.48 --> 01:03:41.24
I just don't want you wasting time getting back to your kids. He said, Stifley, I'll stay with

579
01:03:41.24 --> 01:03:47.16
the sections, sir. He didn't like my favoring him. He went back to the mortarmen and told

580
01:03:47.16 --> 01:03:57.56
them to get ready to move out. I'm telling you, there's a certain bond. There's a certain bond.

581
01:03:57.56 --> 01:04:01.72
And obviously in this case, it's a bond that's even stronger than the bond he has with his kids.

582
01:04:02.60 --> 01:04:07.40
It is the bond that he knows his brothers and arms are going into harm's way, and he's going with

583
01:04:07.40 --> 01:04:18.28
him no matter what. So now we get Baker one seven. They're dug into some positions. They've moved,

584
01:04:18.28 --> 01:04:21.80
and now they're dug into some positions back to the book. In the brush below Kaiser's

585
01:04:21.80 --> 01:04:27.80
Patoon, Chinese assault squads were waited in disciplined silence for the rockets and bugles

586
01:04:27.80 --> 01:04:33.72
that would signal them to attack. They're quilted uniforms kept them from shivering in the chill

587
01:04:33.72 --> 01:04:41.08
night. They already knew in detail how Kaiser's defenses were set up and the location of each forward

588
01:04:41.08 --> 01:04:47.72
hole and our weapons. During the later afternoon, their officers had watched Baker one seven

589
01:04:47.72 --> 01:04:54.68
dig in and they knew our line as well as we did. Under cover of darkness, the assault teams had

590
01:04:54.68 --> 01:04:59.80
crept soundlessly into their jump-off positions within grenade range of the marine mine.

591
01:04:59.80 --> 01:05:07.000
These soldiers were honored that they would be the first Chinese to attack American Marines.

592
01:05:09.16 --> 01:05:15.64
So these guys are staged and ready, and here we go. The sound of a rocket ripping through the air

593
01:05:15.64 --> 01:05:21.40
close above us jolted me away can brought me upright in our hole. Kelly was with me, a streak of

594
01:05:21.40 --> 01:05:26.52
fluorescent green crossed our line, followed by a red rocket from the other direction. Bugles

595
01:05:26.52 --> 01:05:33.80
blared and whistle shrild down the Sudan valley. The luminous hands of my watch said zero, zero,

596
01:05:33.80 --> 01:05:41.64
three, zero, Baker one seven was under attack. A sudden clamor erupted from Hank Kaiser's side of the hill,

597
01:05:41.64 --> 01:05:48.92
the eerie chant, malin die, malin die issuing from a chorus of Chinese voices, then the crash of

598
01:05:48.92 --> 01:05:53.32
mortars, the boom, and concussion of grenades in the sharp sputter of burp guns.

599
01:05:53.32 --> 01:06:00.44
Seconds later, there was the deeper sound of answering marine rifles and bars joined by the

600
01:06:00.44 --> 01:06:07.40
pounding of arm-machine guns and the explosion of marine grenades. The screams of wounded men

601
01:06:07.40 --> 01:06:15.24
soon added to the malage of sounds, along with profanities of rage in both languages.

602
01:06:15.24 --> 01:06:27.56
Fast forward a little bit, Chinese grenades exploded into the line and their burp guns blazed.

603
01:06:27.56 --> 01:06:32.76
The first wave of enemy soldiers rushed in and forward holes were buried in mounds of

604
01:06:32.76 --> 01:06:39.000
quilted uniforms, clubbing and stabbing that Chinese surged up the third battoons hill.

605
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:45.48
Behind them were left dead marines and wounded men who cried for the help of their corpsmen.

606
01:06:46.68 --> 01:06:50.76
One of the things that they talk about in here is one of the tactics that the Chinese used

607
01:06:51.72 --> 01:06:57.40
is not everyone who would even carry a weapon when they would attack. If you were a guy that wasn't

608
01:06:57.40 --> 01:07:02.04
carrying a weapon, you would go attack and soon as someone got shot, you would take the weapon and carry on.

609
01:07:02.04 --> 01:07:10.28
That's how many people they had, number one. They also didn't have a weapon for every guy.

610
01:07:10.28 --> 01:07:14.28
They would have given them. But they also said, here's the plan. But then think about how

611
01:07:14.28 --> 01:07:18.60
now light you are. You're not even carrying a weapon. You're not even carrying any ammunition or anything.

612
01:07:18.60 --> 01:07:22.44
You're just able to travel and it's hard for people that

613
01:07:22.44 --> 01:07:29.08
we're never put on gear. It burns you down so much it just makes you so and you get used to it.

614
01:07:29.08 --> 01:07:33.64
Sure. But when you can get as used to it as you want, when you take it off, you feel like Superman.

615
01:07:34.28 --> 01:07:40.36
These Koreans are the Chinese are feeling like Superman sneaking up into these positions.

616
01:07:40.36 --> 01:07:44.52
They also had real legit winter gear at least this group. We're going to run in some groups that

617
01:07:44.52 --> 01:07:52.60
didn't have it. But they got these nice quilted uniforms and jackets. That's they're just bringing it.

618
01:07:52.60 --> 01:07:59.80
They're bringing it back to the book. Van Winkle ready the Marines near him for the next

619
01:07:59.80 --> 01:08:06.20
Chinese attack putting his people into recaptured fighting holes. The men stacked Chinese bodies in

620
01:08:06.20 --> 01:08:11.64
front of their holes for greater protection. Somebody yelled, the Van Winkle, that his own shoulder

621
01:08:11.64 --> 01:08:16.68
was bleeding. The big sergeant felt his arm and found a Chinese bullet had indeed passed through his

622
01:08:16.68 --> 01:08:26.76
shoulder. He didn't care. Nobody, sorry, nearby a man on the ground sobbing and shaking.

623
01:08:26.76 --> 01:08:34.44
My buddy, my buddy, Gooks shot his head clean off. The orange glare of a Chinese grenade illuminated

624
01:08:34.44 --> 01:08:40.44
the sobbing Marine. Van Winkle crawled over to the man, grasspeas are him saying, come on kid, come

625
01:08:40.44 --> 01:08:49.16
with me. You'll be alright. He rose from the ground and pulled the kid up with him.

626
01:08:48.76 --> 01:08:56.36
Leadership. Going forward a little bit, Archie Van Winkle now found himself on the lower

627
01:08:56.36 --> 01:09:01.80
fringes of the Chinese attack. He ignored his wounded shoulder and fired his carbine one handed.

628
01:09:01.80 --> 01:09:07.000
He called for nearby remains Marines to follow and launched his own attack into the flank of the

629
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.60
Chinese who were moving up towards Kaiser. So you got to guys wounded, just picking up young Marines

630
01:09:12.60 --> 01:09:17.56
to get them back in the game, firing his rifle with one hand and leading it, leading it,

631
01:09:17.56 --> 01:09:20.52
attack on the flank of the Chinese, that are attacking his buddy.

632
01:09:23.64 --> 01:09:28.28
Higher up the hill, Gunny Foster brought Sherman Richter's two machine guns from first

633
01:09:28.28 --> 01:09:33.56
platoon and they commenced pounding down Kaiser's slope, withering fire and exploding grenades.

634
01:09:33.56 --> 01:09:41.56
Now from both flanks and above stymied the Chinese attack, there was a series of whistle signals

635
01:09:41.56 --> 01:09:46.68
and the attackers fell back. They crawled over their dead but pulled their wounded with them

636
01:09:46.68 --> 01:09:52.12
as they backed down to the bottom of the hill and into the woods. They were supported by

637
01:09:52.12 --> 01:09:57.80
well-directed covering fire and they held good order as they withdrew. When the Chinese were

638
01:09:57.80 --> 01:10:04.36
finding off the hill, the Marines ceased their fire and both Marines went silent. So the Chinese

639
01:10:04.36 --> 01:10:08.44
are also doing cover move as they even as they leave as they withdraw.

640
01:10:15.72 --> 01:10:24.92
They, they're, they're in another little firefight and oh, when's trying to quickly get his

641
01:10:24.92 --> 01:10:31.08
mortar up and they drop a, they drop a mortar around the way a mortar works. You drop the mortar

642
01:10:31.08 --> 01:10:37.56
into the, the round into the tube and it fires. If there's a misfire to really, it's a scary situation

643
01:10:37.56 --> 01:10:42.60
because so if you drop the mortar into the tube and it doesn't come out, it doesn't shoot.

644
01:10:42.60 --> 01:10:47.96
Well now you've got a live round inside the mortar tube. So you have to literally pick up the tube

645
01:10:47.96 --> 01:10:54.52
and let gravity pull, like let the mortar round slide out and you put your hands there to catch it.

646
01:10:54.52 --> 01:10:59.96
Yeah. Well, why does it explode? It's not like a timer or nothing. No, it's like, yeah, it's got a little

647
01:10:59.96 --> 01:11:05.64
detonator that makes it shoot and you got a little propellant around the fin that makes no

648
01:11:05.64 --> 01:11:10.76
different ranges. But essentially you drop this thing in there and it's supposed to shoot out.

649
01:11:10.76 --> 01:11:15.56
And when it doesn't, it's a scary situation. It's now you've got a live round inside your mortar tube

650
01:11:15.56 --> 01:11:21.08
and in order to get it out, you, you, you just lift the mortar tube up and you kind of pull

651
01:11:21.08 --> 01:11:26.44
around into your hands. Yeah. So they get a dug round and there's a bunch of things that can

652
01:11:26.44 --> 01:11:30.52
call it, cause a dug round. Some of it can be, you know, a bad batch of ammunition.

653
01:11:31.40 --> 01:11:35.32
But that's what's going on here. They get a dug round, dug round, try another one. I told

654
01:11:35.32 --> 01:11:38.60
we again, they're trying to get some mortar's down range. So they're on a panic situation and

655
01:11:38.60 --> 01:11:43.48
they're getting shot at by the way, too. Dug round, try another one. I told we get Kelly yelled for us to

656
01:11:43.48 --> 01:11:48.76
hurry up. Wing it asked me to wait while he checked the tube for an obstruction. He grabbed a

657
01:11:48.76 --> 01:11:54.44
long stick, which he shoved into the tube. He pulled out a cleaning rag. The cause of our misfire.

658
01:11:55.16 --> 01:12:00.28
It was careless that we had not checked the tube for an obstruction before we fired.

659
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.68
Wing it said, I won't tell anybody about this if you don't. And he said,

660
01:12:06.68 --> 01:12:13.48
shout out damn it. I yelled at him. And this is the reason I highlighted this because he said, my fear showed

661
01:12:13.48 --> 01:12:21.000
itself in anger. And I think that's an important thing to think about. We all know, we all know

662
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.68
when someone's getting mad, that they're probably afraid, right? They're afraid of something.

663
01:12:26.68 --> 01:12:31.80
That's, so we all see that. So if you're in a leadership position and you start losing your

664
01:12:31.80 --> 01:12:37.08
temper, it's, it's very visible to everybody that you're just scared. Yeah, you might be also

665
01:12:37.08 --> 01:12:40.52
frustrated, but it's showing you what it's showing is that you're losing control of your emotions.

666
01:12:41.48 --> 01:12:46.44
And that's why we can't do that in leadership positions. You can't do that. That's why it's so

667
01:12:46.44 --> 01:12:56.20
much infinitely better to remain calm. Yeah, when, uh, frustration, like all this, so if you go into a

668
01:12:56.20 --> 01:13:01.72
situation where you're scared, you know, so a lot of times, especially if you're like an alpha type

669
01:13:01.72 --> 01:13:07.56
person or a powerful person, you go and you feel that fear, it's basically the fear kind of is this

670
01:13:07.56 --> 01:13:13.56
feeling of weakness. So a natural tendency goes for pretty much everybody. And that's right.

671
01:13:13.56 --> 01:13:20.84
Yeah, it's the bounce back. So, so you, your natural way to invoke power is a girl like this

672
01:13:20.84 --> 01:13:26.36
anger aggression type attitude. So when, you know, leaders or what I want, they feel that fear. It's like,

673
01:13:26.36 --> 01:13:32.44
oh my powerless, it's like a subconscious thing. I'm powerless right now. So I got it. I got a fight back.

674
01:13:32.44 --> 01:13:40.28
So comes anger in this point. And the thing is what you just said, we all humans know that

675
01:13:40.28 --> 01:13:46.28
instinctively. So when you see a leader start to act like that, it becomes very clear that there's

676
01:13:46.28 --> 01:13:52.36
some emotion there, some fears, some frustration, some anxiety. Yeah. And that's gonna spread by the way,

677
01:13:52.36 --> 01:13:56.36
if I start panicking and start getting crazy, echo, you gotta get this done. You know, I'm scared.

678
01:13:56.36 --> 01:14:01.000
So now you're saying, wait, if Jockel's scared, I'm almost scared too. And now we start having issues.

679
01:14:04.68 --> 01:14:15.56
So try and remain calm is the, is the basic principle. So, they get done with that particular

680
01:14:15.56 --> 01:14:22.68
firefight. And we got a little debrief here on it. Back to the book, Baker 17 lost more men that night

681
01:14:22.68 --> 01:14:26.68
than we had in the first five days of our campaign against the North Koreans.

682
01:14:27.56 --> 01:14:32.36
Captain Wilcox raised hell. When he heard Sergeant Dale and his men had been killed and they're

683
01:14:32.36 --> 01:14:36.84
sleeping bags. I didn't cover this section, but one of the, one of the small elements they were in

684
01:14:36.84 --> 01:14:41.40
their sleeping bags got overrun and killed. So Captain Wilcox raised hell. When he heard that Sergeant

685
01:14:41.40 --> 01:14:46.52
Dale and his men had been killed and they're sleeping bags, he made it standard operating procedure

686
01:14:46.52 --> 01:14:50.60
that the company stayed out of sleeping bags at night and when we were on the line.

687
01:14:51.72 --> 01:14:57.08
Tell your people that they can put their feet in the bags and loosen their boom dockers. That's

688
01:14:57.08 --> 01:15:03.64
as far as they go, he told us. From then on, no matter how cold it became, we slept outside of our

689
01:15:03.64 --> 01:15:16.12
bags and our boots only came off to change socks. Now, I didn't cover this part where this happens,

690
01:15:16.12 --> 01:15:24.28
but one of these guys, Sergeant Loney, he had taken a patrol to another area in one of the mortars

691
01:15:24.28 --> 01:15:30.76
and when he went, they got lost. And then when they got lost, they got overrun and instead of fighting

692
01:15:30.76 --> 01:15:34.84
or doing anything, they just all ran. They just all ran in different directions. Now actually all

693
01:15:34.84 --> 01:15:40.60
of them lived, miracle, all of them lived. I shouldn't say they got no overrun, but fighting broke

694
01:15:40.60 --> 01:15:47.08
out and instead of doing something organized, they just all took off. And so, so Sergeant Loney,

695
01:15:48.20 --> 01:15:53.000
he's, they come back and they say, what, you know, Owen says, hey, what happened out there and

696
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.68
they said, Sergeant Loney, just, you know, basically said every man for himself.

697
01:15:56.68 --> 01:16:03.88
And so he's about to get relieved of his command, which means you got fired in the military.

698
01:16:04.84 --> 01:16:10.12
Back to the book, Sergeant Loney, I'm relieving you your squad. He looks straight ahead,

699
01:16:10.12 --> 01:16:15.72
but his eyes moistened. You let your men down last night, you abandoned your responsibilities.

700
01:16:15.72 --> 01:16:21.32
It's only good luck that the squad wasn't wiped out. They could all be dead or taken prisoner.

701
01:16:21.32 --> 01:16:27.64
Loney's voice trembled. Lieutenant, it was pitch black down there. We were lost. I used my best

702
01:16:27.64 --> 01:16:34.28
judgment. I can understand getting lost, I said, but you said no security when the Chinese came through,

703
01:16:34.28 --> 01:16:43.16
you forgot to take, you forgot your men to take care of yourself. Lieutenant, I panicked.

704
01:16:43.16 --> 01:16:48.52
I admit that, but if you give me another chance, tears streamed down his cheeks and he looked to the ground.

705
01:16:48.52 --> 01:16:57.16
I can't give you another chance, your men don't respect you. You report to the CP. They'll give

706
01:16:57.16 --> 01:17:03.72
you orders from there. His head bowed. Sergeant Loney said, I'm sorry sir. I'm very sorry.

707
01:17:04.92 --> 01:17:11.88
I'm sorry to Sergeant dismissed. Sergeant Loney walked back to the section perimeter.

708
01:17:11.88 --> 01:17:20.76
Gathered his gear, then charged up hill to the CP. No one said goodbye to him. I felt sorry for the

709
01:17:20.76 --> 01:17:27.96
man, and I couldn't forget the times that fear had taken me close to the edge of panic too.

710
01:17:30.20 --> 01:17:34.92
That's why I included that, because Owen was going through all kinds of

711
01:17:34.92 --> 01:17:41.64
fearful situations. He knows that he's been close to that edge, but he doesn't cross the line.

712
01:17:43.40 --> 01:17:46.44
He holds the line, and that's the difference.

713
01:17:52.68 --> 01:17:59.80
Now, they're pressing forward again. This entire book is them either pressing forward or you're

714
01:17:59.80 --> 01:18:06.36
going to see quickly that it becomes them trying to leave. Once they're surrounded, back to the

715
01:18:06.36 --> 01:18:11.72
book, Baker 17 took point and marched for more than an hour without any sign of the Chinese.

716
01:18:12.84 --> 01:18:18.68
A single file of each of us on the side of the road, the men moving easily, so they're pushing

717
01:18:18.68 --> 01:18:24.92
forward enough, and it's happening all the sudden. Don't like this one damn bit, Lieutenant Owen.

718
01:18:24.92 --> 01:18:30.36
Oh Brian said to me, he was a reserved combat experienced from the Pacific War.

719
01:18:31.32 --> 01:18:36.12
It is a natural for the gooks to let us move up this easy. We're walking into their trap.

720
01:18:38.36 --> 01:18:45.32
All I know is that MacArthur says the first Marine division is going to go for the Yaloo River.

721
01:18:46.84 --> 01:18:52.28
I said the Yaloo River was North Korea's border with China. So, they've been ordered. Hey,

722
01:18:52.28 --> 01:18:57.56
you're going to the Yaloo River and pretty much they're all saying at this point they all kind of

723
01:18:57.56 --> 01:19:03.000
feel like it's a trap. But they're walking, they're not getting any resistance. Back to the book,

724
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.36
the troops were in good humor. They joked and laughed as we marched and made them seen comments about

725
01:19:08.36 --> 01:19:13.96
the things that were central to their lives, the chow, the terrain, the enemy, the lack of women.

726
01:19:15.48 --> 01:19:19.32
Second thing I'm going to do when I see my wife again is take off my pack.

727
01:19:19.32 --> 01:19:22.52
I said one of the married reserves in the column.

728
01:19:23.56 --> 01:19:28.20
Oh yeah, came the answer by the time you see her again, you'll forget what the first thing was.

729
01:19:30.04 --> 01:19:34.60
Hell, it'll be so long before we get backstakes side. You'll be too old for that stuff.

730
01:19:35.24 --> 01:19:38.84
Someone else joked to the married man who is nearly 30 years old.

731
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.84
I'm telling you guys keep up the good spirits and that is that is it's impossible. You know, I got

732
01:19:48.84 --> 01:19:54.76
to include this because I always had fun on the points. I was saying this the other day,

733
01:19:54.76 --> 01:20:01.64
we laughed out loud like once a day in Iraq, laughed out loud, hysterically at something.

734
01:20:03.72 --> 01:20:09.40
So for those of you that are civilians or don't have any comprehension of this kind of thing,

735
01:20:10.36 --> 01:20:14.76
guys that are in the military, they have a good time. Even in the worst situations,

736
01:20:14.76 --> 01:20:21.16
they're having we have fun. You have to. And you know, you can apply that to your job,

737
01:20:21.16 --> 01:20:27.24
to your job, when things get stressful, when things start getting hard. As a leader, if you're just

738
01:20:27.24 --> 01:20:31.48
bearing more stress on everybody, it's not going to help. One of the best ways to alleviate stress

739
01:20:31.48 --> 01:20:34.76
is to have some fun. And that's exactly what's going on here. The guys are on patrol. Okay,

740
01:20:34.76 --> 01:20:39.16
we're not getting shot at. So guess what? Let's bust this guy's ass about messing his wife.

741
01:20:39.16 --> 01:20:46.36
No problem. At alleviate some of that stress, you don't need to just bear down and create more

742
01:20:46.36 --> 01:20:50.92
stress on your people. Not been asked that a couple of people have asked me that on social media.

743
01:20:50.92 --> 01:20:58.28
Can you tell us about, you know, humor in, as a leader, when do you use humor?

744
01:20:58.28 --> 01:21:04.36
Absolutely. We always have fun. And you know, there's obviously a time to be serious, but there's

745
01:21:04.36 --> 01:21:10.84
plenty of time when you're going to joke around and have fun and poke funny each other all the time.

746
01:21:10.84 --> 01:21:17.48
Yeah, do you ever run into situations where, you know, some people they just joke more than

747
01:21:17.48 --> 01:21:21.88
other people. And then there's a, you know, the opposite guys, joke less. You ever run into a

748
01:21:21.88 --> 01:21:26.44
situation where you are serious and then someone's like trying to make jokes, you know, and it does

749
01:21:26.44 --> 01:21:32.84
get annoying or in the way of, I don't know that people, when when I'm serious, I don't get a lot of

750
01:21:32.84 --> 01:21:40.92
jokes, you're in the game. I'm just, I'm saying mostly. I mean, and I think I think there's a pretty

751
01:21:42.92 --> 01:21:48.28
I mean, maybe that happens in, you know, in a school setting, you know, or I guess in a business

752
01:21:48.28 --> 01:21:52.44
setting it could happen, but if you've got a, if you've got a good team that works a lot together,

753
01:21:52.44 --> 01:22:00.04
people know what you're serious. Yeah. And once you tell a joke or you crack a wise crack and nobody

754
01:22:00.04 --> 01:22:03.56
laughs and you just get a look from people going, hey man, shut up, that's it. You know, so maybe

755
01:22:03.56 --> 01:22:07.32
I've, maybe that's happening to me a dozen times in my career where somebody said something to, you know,

756
01:22:07.32 --> 01:22:14.04
everyone just said, okay, we're, you know, enough at everybody feels it. Yeah. Yeah, I would imagine

757
01:22:14.04 --> 01:22:18.60
to working that close with important tasks. Like that important, people are pretty going to be pretty

758
01:22:18.60 --> 01:22:25.72
much in tune with the comedy dynamic. Exactly. Now, I had a guy that I worked with when I was the

759
01:22:25.72 --> 01:22:32.36
admiral's aide and he, he and I, he was older than me, he was actually retired captain. He's one of

760
01:22:32.36 --> 01:22:37.24
my favorite guys, but I was the admiral's aide so as a young, you know, young lieutenant and he was a

761
01:22:37.24 --> 01:22:44.12
retired captain and we would go back and forth all day long regardless of what the situation was.

762
01:22:44.12 --> 01:22:50.12
We would never say a serious thing to each other. The entire day for months on end. Nothing,

763
01:22:50.12 --> 01:22:56.20
everything was a sarcastic kind of comment through each other and it made a pretty, a pretty

764
01:22:56.20 --> 01:23:00.84
miserable job of being the admiral's aide. It's not a fun job. It made it like we just had a good time.

765
01:23:00.84 --> 01:23:05.96
So once again, we're even in a situation where hey, I'm in a uniform and an office all day from

766
01:23:05.96 --> 01:23:11.72
six o'clock in the morning till 7 o'clock at night every day, day on day, you know, in the military

767
01:23:11.72 --> 01:23:15.24
and in the civilian world, when you come back from a trip from somewhere, they're like, oh,

768
01:23:15.24 --> 01:23:18.28
you, oh, you, we're on trip. Hey, you know, don't come into my morning, you know, you're coming

769
01:23:18.28 --> 01:23:23.000
in a little late because you got back at midnight. You're coming in at six. That's the way it is.

770
01:23:23.72 --> 01:23:27.40
There's no, there's no, oh, you haven't seen your family in two weeks. That's cool. We'll see

771
01:23:27.40 --> 01:23:30.44
it six o'clock in the morning tomorrow. Oh, you want to take your daughter to school? No, not

772
01:23:30.44 --> 01:23:36.60
happy. So it's like that. And yet, what I had this one guy that I worked with who we just, we

773
01:23:36.60 --> 01:23:41.72
just never said anything serious to each other and it always kept it light and fun. And that's,

774
01:23:41.72 --> 01:23:47.48
that was pretty awesome. Was that, do you, I mean, thinking back, do you think that that was on purpose

775
01:23:47.48 --> 01:23:51.72
or did it just kind of shake itself out like that? It just should itself out. You know, we just said

776
01:23:51.72 --> 01:23:58.68
funny, uh, the way our relationship was was we were just two guys that like to give each other a

777
01:23:58.68 --> 01:24:03.000
hard time about stuff and set each other up for stuff and just just, yeah, we both knew. I mean,

778
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.56
he was under a stressful job as well. You know, he's got, he's got a lot of pressure on him. And so

779
01:24:07.56 --> 01:24:10.92
what are we going to do? Set there and be miserable all day? No, you know, what we're going to have a

780
01:24:10.92 --> 01:24:16.68
good time even in this, you know, fairly miserable administrative scenario that we're living in.

781
01:24:16.68 --> 01:24:21.24
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good time with it. Because some people do it on purpose where it's like,

782
01:24:21.24 --> 01:24:25.56
all dang things are getting real tense here. Yeah. I work with it. And so they'll throw in jokes.

783
01:24:26.12 --> 01:24:30.52
They're going to be on that fine line between, okay, you're right now things are tense. Why

784
01:24:30.52 --> 01:24:34.68
do you say that joke? That's inappropriate. And the other thing is just like it helps. You know,

785
01:24:34.68 --> 01:24:40.44
same like in like this guy and I, we would be even in the really stressful situation when no one

786
01:24:40.44 --> 01:24:45.72
else was joking. I might like, you know, shoot him a look across the room and roll my eyes at him like

787
01:24:45.72 --> 01:24:49.80
you didn't see this come and did you tough guy and we would just be laughing. So yeah, even then

788
01:24:49.80 --> 01:24:54.04
really stressful stuff, we would we would lighten it up. Yeah. That's because, you know, that's the first

789
01:24:54.04 --> 01:25:02.04
time that we had. Yeah. Yeah. All right, speaking of not no joke whatsoever back to the book,

790
01:25:02.04 --> 01:25:07.32
made your tie, the operations officer told us that there were increasing reports of heavy

791
01:25:07.96 --> 01:25:15.24
enemy concentrations on all sides of the battalion. However, General MacArthur himself was expressing

792
01:25:15.24 --> 01:25:20.12
impatience with a slow pace made by the first Marine Division and its progress toward the Chinese

793
01:25:20.12 --> 01:25:25.64
border. The army was trying to light a fire under General Smith, the Division commander. So

794
01:25:26.52 --> 01:25:31.000
you got the Marines are saying, hey, look, looks like we're starting to get surrounded here and

795
01:25:32.20 --> 01:25:36.76
talks a little bit about this in the book. The Marines were kind of slow rolling. They weren't,

796
01:25:36.76 --> 01:25:39.96
they weren't making any great effort to go as fast as they could because they felt like they were

797
01:25:39.96 --> 01:25:44.84
going to be trapped. So they weren't trying to move as fast as they could in MacArthur's general

798
01:25:44.84 --> 01:25:49.16
McCarthy in Tokyo, by the way, saying, hey, come on, Marines, you know, army's pushing up

799
01:25:49.16 --> 01:25:53.88
the real quick. What's wrong with you guys? But they're starting to get into our reports that they're

800
01:25:53.88 --> 01:26:00.60
being surrounded. And oh, by the way, Lieutenant Lee, who I talked about earlier, the real

801
01:26:00.60 --> 01:26:06.76
by the book guy, he actually got wounded and when he got wounded taken in hospital, he went on,

802
01:26:06.76 --> 01:26:12.92
he went on, he went absent without leave A wall. He went A wall from hospital to get back to the

803
01:26:12.92 --> 01:26:19.40
line. Oh, yeah, he's, oh, no, I'm fine. My arm can't move it. It's in a sling, doesn't matter. I'm going to fight.

804
01:26:21.48 --> 01:26:27.56
And speaking of Lee, talking about Lee's, Lee's platoon here, when they weren't on patrol,

805
01:26:27.56 --> 01:26:33.24
Lee put his men through a rigorous training program of small unit tactics. They maneuvered all

806
01:26:33.24 --> 01:26:41.16
over the nearby hills and they bitched at some extra work. Lee paid little heed to the grumbling.

807
01:26:41.16 --> 01:26:46.84
Soon we will meet the enemy. He predicted to his men. We will be ready. So Lee is a hard ass and his

808
01:26:46.84 --> 01:26:51.48
guys. Everyone else is doing, you know, they're, they're moving up north and it was an easy day of patrol

809
01:26:51.48 --> 01:26:54.60
because remember the Chinese, they're pushing hard against them right now. So what does he do at night?

810
01:26:54.60 --> 01:26:57.40
Oh, you guys, we're going to go do some work. We're going to go get some tactical drills.

811
01:27:00.44 --> 01:27:06.44
Back to the book. It was an article of faith with Lee that combat leadership came from the front

812
01:27:06.44 --> 01:27:12.28
in the attack. He positioned himself with the most advanced squad just behind the point.

813
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:19.56
He wore a bright fluorescent pink vest, fashion of cloth panels that he obtained from the tactical

814
01:27:19.56 --> 01:27:24.44
air team. The intended purpose of the brilliantly colored panels was to mark the four extent of

815
01:27:24.44 --> 01:27:29.64
our lines for supporting aircraft. Lee wore his vessel and his men could locate him quickly during

816
01:27:29.64 --> 01:27:37.40
a firefight. He still had a sling on his wounded right arm and he carried his carbine in his left hand.

817
01:27:37.40 --> 01:27:46.44
He fired from the hip using it to shoot tracers that marked sectors. So Lee is just, I mean, a whole

818
01:27:46.44 --> 01:27:57.80
northern level, whole northern level, two in Lee. That's his full name, two in Lee. Now we get into a situation.

819
01:27:59.24 --> 01:28:04.28
The Chinese were dug in above Lee. They had a machine gun and a line of rifles more

820
01:28:04.28 --> 01:28:10.12
vulnerable than their usual defensive formations. They were expertly deployed below the crest

821
01:28:10.12 --> 01:28:15.64
and their automatic weapons fired short discipline bursts. Tracers street and bullets and

822
01:28:15.64 --> 01:28:22.04
shrapnel swept down the stroke. Slope. It took Lee some time to locate the machine gun that was

823
01:28:22.04 --> 01:28:27.16
giving the most trouble. When he found it, he fired one hand to put a tracer on it. His squad

824
01:28:27.16 --> 01:28:33.40
moved into skirmish lines and the NCO sent their own tracers to mark for their sectors. The bar

825
01:28:33.40 --> 01:28:38.28
and rifles followed, sending a great volume of fire up the slope at the Chinese.

826
01:28:38.92 --> 01:28:43.80
Wing it wave to me to let me know the mortar was ready. I aimed a tracer toward the machine gun

827
01:28:43.80 --> 01:28:50.28
and pumped my arm four times. The signal for 400 yards. I saw around leave the tube and follow

828
01:28:50.28 --> 01:28:55.72
its path that disappeared over the ridge line. Wing it realized that he was too long and without

829
01:28:55.72 --> 01:29:00.84
need for my correction, he came up a turn. So he's adjusting the where the mortar rounds hitting

830
01:29:00.84 --> 01:29:07.96
on his own. His second round was close and I waved him to fire for effect. We seldom wasted ammo

831
01:29:07.96 --> 01:29:13.24
bracketing a target. ammo carried up the hills was too valuable to be wasted on the niceties.

832
01:29:13.96 --> 01:29:20.76
The enemy gun slackened as winged as winged pounded them. Lee squad moved upward, responding to the

833
01:29:20.76 --> 01:29:27.56
NCO signals with short bounds. Fire team by fire team. 5 10 yards at a dash. Then the ground,

834
01:29:27.56 --> 01:29:32.60
bearing their enemy on the bearing fire on the enemy as the next fire team went in closer.

835
01:29:32.60 --> 01:29:36.92
Cover move. It's happening again. The mortar is covering form and then each individual

836
01:29:36.92 --> 01:29:43.08
fire team is covering for each other. It was the classic Marine rifle tactic that Lee had drilled

837
01:29:43.08 --> 01:29:49.08
into his platoon during his extra training sessions. A Marine went down and rioted on the ground.

838
01:29:49.08 --> 01:29:53.64
The platoon's corpsman built Davis dashed low across the slope and crashed at the wounded man's

839
01:29:53.64 --> 01:29:59.24
side. Another Marine fell and didn't move again. His buddy stabbed the dead man's rifle into the

840
01:29:59.24 --> 01:30:05.64
earth by its bayonet then continued forward. The Chinese found it difficult to defend against

841
01:30:05.64 --> 01:30:11.64
Lee's energetic tactics. Our coordinated mortar and machine gun fire kept them pinned to the ground.

842
01:30:12.28 --> 01:30:17.80
They were no longer able to apply aimed fire and their effectiveness to then diminished as our

843
01:30:17.80 --> 01:30:24.12
rifleman pushed closer in on them. Cover move. By the way, there's a reason why when I wrote down

844
01:30:24.12 --> 01:30:28.68
the four laws of combat, the number one rule is cover move. This is why.

845
01:30:30.60 --> 01:30:35.56
Lee sent a squad crawling forward into grenade range. I signal the winged to see

846
01:30:35.56 --> 01:30:41.000
his fire and the mortar stopped exploding along the forward crest of the hill. The Chinese soldiers

847
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.88
heaved the broads of their potato masher concussion grenades down the slope. The Marines

848
01:30:45.88 --> 01:30:50.84
threw a responding volley, Argrinades were more powerful, filling the air with bits of hot flying

849
01:30:50.84 --> 01:30:57.32
steel. Both sides dove for holes, another volley was thrown. Lee ran forward, waving the

850
01:30:57.32 --> 01:31:03.08
carbine over his head and calling for his Marines to follow. They searched for the top,

851
01:31:03.08 --> 01:31:09.80
screaming their gun, hoe, and rebel yells. The Chinese withdrew. They pulled their wounded away,

852
01:31:09.80 --> 01:31:14.28
but left their dead on the slope. Lee pushed his men over the ridge line where they prepared

853
01:31:14.28 --> 01:31:20.84
to defend against a counter attack. Lupuccini stood beside Lee, his bar at the ready. Lupuccini

854
01:31:20.84 --> 01:31:27.24
had appointed himself Lee's bodyguard. Sergeant Bondaron, the Paltoon guide, rifle through the

855
01:31:27.24 --> 01:31:33.64
pockets of the dead Chinese gathering material for our intelligence people. I sent Kelly for a

856
01:31:33.64 --> 01:31:40.68
detail of the ammo carriers to bear the casualties. Bill Davis had two wounded men doped up with

857
01:31:40.68 --> 01:31:46.52
more feen and out of pain. And there was one Marine dead already covered by his poncho.

858
01:31:47.80 --> 01:31:53.16
When he was certain that the Chinese would not counter attack, Lee ordered us off the hill,

859
01:31:53.16 --> 01:32:00.12
end of patrol. On the return march to the company perimeter, no one complained about Lieutenant

860
01:32:00.12 --> 01:32:07.80
Lee's excessive training methods. He walked along the column and thanked the men for their good work.

861
01:32:09.16 --> 01:32:14.92
I wondered to myself how many fire flights Lee would survive standing at the front of his troops

862
01:32:14.92 --> 01:32:24.12
clad in that brilliant pink vest. So the excessive training, everyone's complaining when they're

863
01:32:24.12 --> 01:32:28.76
training and then you get to a firefight and everyone's thankful that they had good discipline

864
01:32:28.76 --> 01:32:40.76
leadership. A little bit more of Lee now, this point again, they're continuing to get pressed

865
01:32:40.76 --> 01:32:46.04
by the Chinese back to the book more Chinese fired broken out far to our right in front of Lee's

866
01:32:46.04 --> 01:32:52.12
in front of Lee's line. They fired from a sharp short hill that rose from the meadow. Lee

867
01:32:52.12 --> 01:32:57.80
wields one of his rifle squads to face the rise and maneuvered them forward. Burrace's gun was

868
01:32:57.80 --> 01:33:02.92
with Lee and he traversed the face of the hill with eight cheese before the squad moved up. So

869
01:33:02.92 --> 01:33:07.72
eight cheese is high explosive mortars and burrace is one of the mortarmen and he's covering

870
01:33:07.72 --> 01:33:12.44
for the movement of Lee as they're pushing up. The Chinese ceased firing with Drew quickly

871
01:33:12.44 --> 01:33:17.80
a familiar tactic. Lee stayed with the main body of his platoon and sent a fire team up to

872
01:33:17.80 --> 01:33:22.92
re-con order the top. When they reached the top of the rise, the four men walked along the

873
01:33:22.92 --> 01:33:28.12
ridge and search of the vanished enemy. Looking up Lee saw his men silhouette against the

874
01:33:28.12 --> 01:33:34.60
skyline and yelled for them to get down. They were perfectly outlined targets. The Chinese saw them

875
01:33:34.60 --> 01:33:41.08
too and already had the ridge line registered for their mortars. Their first rounds blew a marine

876
01:33:41.08 --> 01:33:47.08
to pieces. The next barrage claimed two more. The fourth man dove from the ridge and leaped

877
01:33:47.08 --> 01:33:52.52
rolled and stumbled down the hill. He came to a halt at the feet of Lieutenant Lee.

878
01:33:53.64 --> 01:33:59.80
Lee had seen three of his men needlessly killed and he stood in silent fury. His good hand

879
01:33:59.80 --> 01:34:04.76
gripped his car being so tight that his knuckles went white. Stupid. He hissed through his

880
01:34:04.76 --> 01:34:12.52
clenched teeth. Stupid. Stupid. Over and over again. Stupid. He turned to Jean O'Brien his platoon

881
01:34:12.52 --> 01:34:18.60
sergeant. See to it that this never happens again, sergeant. You tell the men if you, if I see

882
01:34:18.60 --> 01:34:26.12
another marine on the skyline, I will shoot him myself. Lieutenant Lee strode off to be by himself

883
01:34:26.12 --> 01:34:38.44
until his fury and frustration subsided. So you got guys making big mistakes and for those

884
01:34:38.44 --> 01:34:42.44
of you don't understand what happened when you stand up on the ridge line you're completely obvious.

885
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.44
It's very clear and Lee's watching this happen and sees that his guys were a ripe target.

886
01:34:48.44 --> 01:34:56.76
He's yelling at him but it's too late and the mortar's hit. Now we get the company here,

887
01:34:56.76 --> 01:35:02.20
moving a little bit forward. Now the company is actually pinned down. The company's pinned down.

888
01:35:04.36 --> 01:35:09.80
Back to the book when the skipper had artillery's fire control on the radio. He called in the

889
01:35:09.80 --> 01:35:18.04
coordinates coordinates for a registration round. The battery of 105 mm howitzer that supported was

890
01:35:18.04 --> 01:35:24.52
dug in a mile and a half away. So in a mile and a half away you got these 105 mm howitzers.

891
01:35:24.52 --> 01:35:31.88
Big giant cannons. Less than a minute later and you got the company commander that's calling in

892
01:35:32.60 --> 01:35:37.56
calling in to tell them where to shoot these. Because in my office you can't see. There's no

893
01:35:37.56 --> 01:35:42.04
satellite back then. You can't see. So you're just going off of bearing in distance.

894
01:35:43.64 --> 01:35:47.32
Back to the book less than a minute later we heard the heavy ripping sound of the first round

895
01:35:47.32 --> 01:35:52.36
cutting the air over our heads. Atlanta to 100 yards of front in front of where Lee the

896
01:35:52.36 --> 01:35:59.48
captain and I stood. Stabs of flame, flame like lightning from a black cloud, leaped off the ground

897
01:35:59.48 --> 01:36:04.76
and we felt the earth tremble from the explosion. Close got damn it too close shout at the skipper.

898
01:36:05.48 --> 01:36:12.36
Then into the mic he said, add 3-0-0, repeat, add 3-0-0. So he's telling them that means add,

899
01:36:12.36 --> 01:36:20.52
it means shoot 300 meters further. The next round landed further away and we barely saw the

900
01:36:20.52 --> 01:36:26.20
stabs of flame. It was where the skipper wanted it. The enemy machine gun fire had stopped.

901
01:36:26.20 --> 01:36:33.40
The Chinese knew what would be coming at them. Repeat range. Give me concentration fire.

902
01:36:33.40 --> 01:36:40.20
Three valleys on my command. The concentration fire would saturate the area where the Chinese were

903
01:36:40.20 --> 01:36:45.40
concealed. The captain waited to give the order to fire until Sergeant King had positioned

904
01:36:45.40 --> 01:36:52.68
the covering squad in front of us. Fire! 22nds later the first rounds of the barrage landed

905
01:36:52.68 --> 01:37:00.04
less than 50 yards away. Short rounds. Meaning that the rounds didn't go as far as they were supposed

906
01:37:00.04 --> 01:37:06.52
to. We dove for the deck all of us, even Lee. The following rounds dropped among the front

907
01:37:06.52 --> 01:37:12.44
of the squad that first put to an had position to cover the company withdrawal. Screams from

908
01:37:12.44 --> 01:37:20.76
our own men, mud and flame and crashing thunder. The skipper yelled into the radio cease fire, cease fire,

909
01:37:20.76 --> 01:37:30.76
short rounds, short rounds. Friendly fire. The worst thing that can happen in combat are

910
01:37:30.76 --> 01:37:38.52
dismal day turned to horror. Crys and moans and agonized screams pierced the black smoke that

911
01:37:38.52 --> 01:37:45.48
drifted over the broken ground. Doc Mickens and Joe King were already working among the wounded

912
01:37:45.48 --> 01:37:52.60
and mangled dead marines. Bill Davis and Ed Topple, the other puttune corpsman sprinted across the

913
01:37:52.60 --> 01:37:59.16
field to help. Captain Wilcox yelled into the radio as the next line of shell was exploded.

914
01:37:59.16 --> 01:38:05.24
Now away from us farther to our front. They had been in the air before the gunners could comply

915
01:38:05.24 --> 01:38:10.84
with the order to cease fire. They did us no further damage but their noise added to the hellish

916
01:38:10.84 --> 01:38:18.68
scene. I arose shaken and not sure what to do. I saw Sergeant Wright at the edge of the field

917
01:38:18.68 --> 01:38:23.88
and called for him to bring the ammo carriers forward. We would use them to carry the casualties

918
01:38:23.88 --> 01:38:29.64
away. Joe Kersaba had already brought the company headquarters people to lend a hand with the

919
01:38:29.64 --> 01:38:38.04
grizzly work. We had four more dead and three wounded. Kersaba went to the skipper and said that we

920
01:38:38.04 --> 01:38:43.64
should get the company out of this place and back down the road. Captain shook his head a few times

921
01:38:43.64 --> 01:38:50.20
to clear it and thought about Joe's suggestion for several seconds. Then he got Kaiser and Lee

922
01:38:50.20 --> 01:38:55.96
on the walkie talkies and told them to prepare their puttunes to move back. He told me to walk a

923
01:38:55.96 --> 01:39:02.12
screen of H.E.'s 200 yards out to discourage any Chinese from following us. When I reported to him

924
01:39:02.12 --> 01:39:06.92
that the mortars were ready to do for the fire mission, I thought I saw tears coming down his face.

925
01:39:07.72 --> 01:39:13.96
Although it could have been the drizzling rain. Eight dead marines for the day, more wounded,

926
01:39:13.96 --> 01:39:22.28
and nothing accomplished. The rain and sleet turned to snow. Wet sticky stuff that coated the

927
01:39:22.28 --> 01:39:29.32
ponchos covering the dead men. The troops struggled down a wet slippery trail to the road,

928
01:39:29.32 --> 01:39:36.12
bearing the dead and wounded. They were soaked through and spoke no words except to blast

929
01:39:36.12 --> 01:39:50.84
them. The goddamn fool who sent us into this miserable wet cold country. Friendly fire, blue on blue.

930
01:39:56.84 --> 01:40:03.16
Think about it. Try and keep it in the front of your head. When you're in combat situations,

931
01:40:03.16 --> 01:40:09.24
try and keep it in the front of your head. Try and keep it as a real possibility. It's not impossible

932
01:40:09.24 --> 01:40:19.08
to have it happen. It's kind of like in fighting. When they say it's the punch that you didn't see,

933
01:40:19.08 --> 01:40:25.96
that's the one that's going to knock you out. It's the same thing in this situation.

934
01:40:25.96 --> 01:40:32.36
If you could see that a blue on blue is going to take place, you would stop it. You can't see it.

935
01:40:32.36 --> 01:40:38.60
It's not something that's going to be unexpected. That's why it happens. It happens because it's unexpected.

936
01:40:39.72 --> 01:40:45.56
And there's a lot of things that can happen when you start bringing artillery in. There's a bunch

937
01:40:45.56 --> 01:40:56.84
of variables there that are really hard to control. But it is, obviously, it's a nightmare. It's a

938
01:40:56.84 --> 01:41:04.28
nightmare. I was having this conversation with one of my silver buddies the other day. That's why

939
01:41:04.28 --> 01:41:11.48
you train hard. That's why you prepare for it. That's why you create chaos and confusion inside

940
01:41:11.48 --> 01:41:16.92
of your training. That you actually force blue on blue. You force blue on blue to happen.

941
01:41:16.92 --> 01:41:21.48
You force these fratricides situations to happen so that they happen in training so that they

942
01:41:21.48 --> 01:41:27.80
don't happen on the battlefield. It's the same thing with the police front. The police

943
01:41:27.80 --> 01:41:34.60
front, sometimes has blue on blue. Train hard, set up the crazy scenarios. Make people do

944
01:41:34.60 --> 01:41:45.80
unexpected things. They come down from that scenario and they get a day arrest. You might think,

945
01:41:45.80 --> 01:41:50.20
hey, you know, you took eight killed and multiple more wounded. I will give you some time off. They got

946
01:41:50.20 --> 01:41:55.56
time off one day, one day arrest and then they're back on the march. Back to the book, the column

947
01:41:55.56 --> 01:42:02.36
march north in a cold swirling wind that swept the road clear of snow. We put on the pond

948
01:42:02.36 --> 01:42:08.20
just again to help award off the wind. They soon froze stiff and crackled as we walked. And if you

949
01:42:08.20 --> 01:42:14.60
notice as they left that other situation, the rain turned to sleep in the snow. So that's like

950
01:42:14.60 --> 01:42:18.92
in one hour winter was here. And so now you're going to, now you're going to start hearing about

951
01:42:18.92 --> 01:42:26.76
the cold big time. The men were in a foul temper. What kind of stupid bastards we got running this

952
01:42:26.76 --> 01:42:31.88
goddamn war came from the column. Don't worry about them. Guys running this goddamn war. They're

953
01:42:31.88 --> 01:42:38.20
sitting by a stove someplace, sticking pins in their maps. Yeah. And they'll get their pick of

954
01:42:38.20 --> 01:42:43.88
cold weather gear before they send us, send it up to us, pour suckers. Guy in the battalion

955
01:42:43.88 --> 01:42:48.76
mess lines said them rear echelon bastards are already wearing big fur coats and winter issue

956
01:42:48.76 --> 01:42:55.56
boat boots. That's okay. We'll get the stuff next spring. Sure, what's left of it. By the time

957
01:42:55.56 --> 01:43:01.000
it gets to us, we'll be needing jungle gear. So these guys are just letting out their frustration

958
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:10.20
and anger. The worst suffering that day came from our feet. We only had thin cotton socks

959
01:43:10.20 --> 01:43:16.28
under the boom dockers, little protection from the cold, especially as they were still damp

960
01:43:16.28 --> 01:43:22.44
under our leggings. We stomped away the freezing toes, the pain of the freezing toes, and kept

961
01:43:22.44 --> 01:43:28.68
the blood circulating. There were complaints of numbness. Some men felt as if they had

962
01:43:28.68 --> 01:43:37.80
pebbles in their socks. We didn't know about frostbite yet. If you don't know what boom

963
01:43:37.80 --> 01:43:45.24
dockers are, they're your basic, like the most basic form of a boot leather rubber sole. That's it.

964
01:43:46.04 --> 01:43:52.92
That's one of the boom dockers. They got cotton socks. Now they get some new gear.

965
01:43:53.96 --> 01:43:58.44
And one of the pieces that they get is called shoe packs. Going to the book, shoe packs

966
01:43:58.44 --> 01:44:05.000
would change the way we walked and bring us the crippling scourge of frostbite. They were big

967
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:10.68
and cumbersome twice the weight of our boom dockers. They had thick molded rubber bottoms with

968
01:44:10.68 --> 01:44:17.96
heavily-created souls. The tops from the ankle up to the shin were made of stiff leather that

969
01:44:17.96 --> 01:44:24.92
lace tightly. shoe packs were clumsy for climbing, climbing and slippery on the ice. The worst

970
01:44:24.92 --> 01:44:31.40
thing about them, however, was that they were laced up when they were laced up no air could circulate.

971
01:44:31.40 --> 01:44:38.60
On a steep climb, on a long marsh, our feet would sweat no matter how cold it was. When we

972
01:44:38.60 --> 01:44:44.76
stopped moving and the cold said in, the sweat soaked felt inserts and socks would freeze.

973
01:44:46.12 --> 01:44:54.92
Long stretches of wet, frozen feet, spelled frostbite. I don't know if you remember this

974
01:44:54.92 --> 01:45:00.52
from the last one we did but I didn't include it. But one of the videos that they showed later

975
01:45:00.52 --> 01:45:07.16
to the soldiers and marines that were going over to Korea was to warn them of frostbite

976
01:45:07.16 --> 01:45:14.52
and it was the doctors with the frostbitten feet and they weren't surgically removing the toes.

977
01:45:14.52 --> 01:45:19.32
They would just break them off because they were frozen dead toes and they would just break

978
01:45:19.32 --> 01:45:25.88
and that's the video they showed them. Hey, keep your feet dry. But it was these poorly designed

979
01:45:25.88 --> 01:45:30.60
shoes was one of the problems that they tried. Oh, we'll make these guys these super warm boots.

980
01:45:30.60 --> 01:45:34.52
Doesn't it's not that easy? It's not that easy. You make them so warm and so waterproof

981
01:45:34.52 --> 01:45:37.96
no aeroscapes from them. Now you've got sweaty feet. Now your feet are going to freeze.

982
01:45:41.88 --> 01:45:46.68
Now we get this one of the replacements that comes in is a guy named Woody Taylor. You're going to

983
01:45:46.68 --> 01:45:52.12
hear a little bit about him and there's a little fireflank that takes place and Captain Wilcox,

984
01:45:52.12 --> 01:45:57.000
who's the company commander, maneuvers, some Woody Taylor's guys. He says, hey, you guys go check that

985
01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:03.40
out over there. Woody Taylor doesn't like it. Those are my men says Woody Taylor. So here we go.

986
01:46:03.40 --> 01:46:09.24
Captain Wilcox, Taylor called Louty Louty to the skipper. If you don't, I've used the word

987
01:46:09.24 --> 01:46:14.28
skipper a bunch. I should have explained what it is. Skipper means the commanding officer of the

988
01:46:14.28 --> 01:46:21.16
company just just like the skipper of a ship. Captain Wilcox, Taylor called Louty to the skipper.

989
01:46:21.16 --> 01:46:26.28
He was red face and out of breath from the run up the column. That's a squad from my

990
01:46:26.28 --> 01:46:30.68
platoon. You sent over there on the flank. Yeah, Louten it. I saw a few bandits over there.

991
01:46:30.68 --> 01:46:36.04
Captain, those are my men. Taylor interrupted. My platoon moves on my orders.

992
01:46:37.08 --> 01:46:43.32
Captain Wilcox glared at Louten it Taylor. I'd seen that cold look many times before

993
01:46:43.32 --> 01:46:48.36
when it had been leveled on me. I figured that Woody Taylor would not be long with Baker

994
01:46:48.36 --> 01:46:54.60
one seven. Our new lieutenant and the captain stared at each other. Woody calmed down a notch.

995
01:46:54.60 --> 01:47:01.40
Sir, he said, I'd much appreciate it. If you put any orders to my men through me. Colonel Davis

996
01:47:01.40 --> 01:47:08.20
set me up here to run this platoon. That's what I reckon to do. Taylor and the skipper were eyeballed

997
01:47:08.20 --> 01:47:14.84
to eyeball and the skipper realized that he had, indeed, violated the chain of command.

998
01:47:14.84 --> 01:47:23.72
Yeah, Louten it. He said, you're right. That's your platoon. And I guess we understand each other.

999
01:47:25.32 --> 01:47:31.16
I guess we do captain said Woody Taylor. All right, then carry on. The skipper dismissed his

1000
01:47:31.16 --> 01:47:37.000
new platoon leader. We figured Woody Taylor was going to have what's going to be one hell of a fighter.

1001
01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:42.68
He was the last replacement officer to come to Baker one seven and he was with us to stay.

1002
01:47:42.68 --> 01:47:49.72
So a little standoff. But there's a lot of little things that go on there. Right. Number one,

1003
01:47:50.84 --> 01:47:56.20
Taylor was too aggressive out of the gate. You know, hey, those were my guys. That was too aggressive.

1004
01:47:56.20 --> 01:47:59.96
He was able to catch himself and back off and say, hey, sir, I really appreciate it.

1005
01:47:59.96 --> 01:48:05.64
If he had come with that attitude from the beginning, he would have had a better chance of

1006
01:48:05.64 --> 01:48:10.28
making what he wanted to have happen with no risk. There was a risk here. There was a risk here

1007
01:48:10.28 --> 01:48:15.40
that Captain Louten called me to get shut up. It might be your platoon. It's my company.

1008
01:48:15.40 --> 01:48:21.08
Don't talk to me about this again. He could have said that. But also, he's a good leader.

1009
01:48:21.64 --> 01:48:27.24
That when got pressed on this, he said, let me touch. He said, getting mad. He was getting mad.

1010
01:48:27.80 --> 01:48:31.32
He detached. He said, okay, wait a second. What's going on here? This young Louten,

1011
01:48:31.32 --> 01:48:35.72
that's in charge of the platoon. I just ordered his guys around without telling him. Now he's mad about it.

1012
01:48:35.72 --> 01:48:40.20
Does that make sense? Yes, it does. He's calm down. He's he's talking to me in a better

1013
01:48:40.20 --> 01:48:45.64
tone now. He's just asking me that he's appreciated. I can accept that. I was a little outlined.

1014
01:48:45.64 --> 01:48:51.40
Cool. Yep. You got it. And they were able to solve that problem. So it's a little dynamics.

1015
01:48:51.96 --> 01:48:54.12
Some dynamics out on the battlefield going on.

1016
01:48:57.40 --> 01:49:05.08
More firefighter happens. More madness going on. They get through the next situation. And now we

1017
01:49:05.08 --> 01:49:09.48
have Colonel Davis again. This is the metal of honor winner who's who's in charge here.

1018
01:49:09.48 --> 01:49:14.04
Back to the book. Colonel Davis came up to make her one seven to inform us that we were moving out again.

1019
01:49:15.08 --> 01:49:21.40
Tomorrow morning we would advance up the west side of the chosen reservoir. Our objective was the

1020
01:49:21.40 --> 01:49:31.32
town of Yudam Nee 14 miles away. This was not a patrol. Our battalion commander told us it was an attack

1021
01:49:31.32 --> 01:49:35.88
and we should expect the fighting to get serious. So they haven't had any serious fighting, right?

1022
01:49:35.88 --> 01:49:40.60
Oh, no. Yes, they have. But expected to get more serious. When he finished briefing the officers

1023
01:49:40.60 --> 01:49:46.68
Colonel Davis asked me to bring Sergeant Wright to him. The hardship transfer order had finally

1024
01:49:46.68 --> 01:49:51.24
come through and our Colonel wanted to say goodbye personally to a good Marine NCO.

1025
01:49:52.20 --> 01:49:56.36
There was a great moment for Sergeant Wright. All the company officers were there.

1026
01:49:56.36 --> 01:50:00.76
And the Colonel expressed his appreciation and best wishes to my departing Sergeant.

1027
01:50:00.76 --> 01:50:05.48
Captain Wilcox and Lieutenant's added their own well-done Sergeant Wright had done a good job

1028
01:50:05.48 --> 01:50:10.04
of whipping the mortar section into shape and keeping them square it away. The mortar has had a

1029
01:50:10.04 --> 01:50:15.000
four farewell party for their Sergeant who had been up with them since the first day at Camp Pendleton.

1030
01:50:15.56 --> 01:50:21.72
The rifle between Corman came by, makins and Davis and Toppo each bringing a canteen of sick

1031
01:50:21.72 --> 01:50:29.56
bay alcohol. The skipper and Joe Kursaba joined us in for a few days. Tos. When he was ready to leave,

1032
01:50:29.56 --> 01:50:33.80
weapon and gear all square it away like a proud, like a parade ground Marine,

1033
01:50:33.80 --> 01:50:38.52
Sergeant Wright approached me. His eyes glistened, probably mine did too.

1034
01:50:39.80 --> 01:50:44.20
Sir, I think we did some good with these people. I want to thank you for giving me a chance to

1035
01:50:44.20 --> 01:50:51.56
serve in your outfit. Thank you, Sergeant Wright. You're a fine Marine NCO, God bless you and your family.

1036
01:50:52.52 --> 01:50:57.88
Sergeant Wright snapped the salute at me and strode off. I would never seem again

1037
01:50:57.88 --> 01:51:09.08
and I would miss him very much. Sergeant Wright had an home. I guess it was his time and he'd

1038
01:51:09.08 --> 01:51:14.36
pushed on when we could have gone home a lot earlier but he pushed on and now they're getting

1039
01:51:14.36 --> 01:51:19.56
ready to make this next move and he has his orders now in hand and orders are orders. So he

1040
01:51:19.56 --> 01:51:25.40
heads up back to the book, the weather turned ugly again as we formed up to Resurm,

1041
01:51:25.40 --> 01:51:31.64
resumed the attack to the north. A bitter cold wind greeted us filled with a stinging gritty snow.

1042
01:51:32.60 --> 01:51:38.76
It was my birthday. After the troops were square it away, I crouched in the ditch alongside

1043
01:51:38.76 --> 01:51:44.76
the road and took some time to go through my snapshots. I thought a Dorothy teaching the happy

1044
01:51:44.76 --> 01:51:52.20
birthday song to the babies and how they would try and sing it. I saw their little pink cheeks

1045
01:51:52.20 --> 01:52:06.20
and blue eyes and Dorothy's golden hair. Rough away from Spent his birthday and as you sit here

1046
01:52:06.20 --> 01:52:11.24
today wherever you're listening to this, know that somewhere in the world there's an American

1047
01:52:11.24 --> 01:52:17.40
serviceman that's out there celebrating their birthday in a similar manner. I guarantee it away

1048
01:52:17.40 --> 01:52:26.52
from his family and his loved ones. What else does he get out for his birthday? He gets some enemy

1049
01:52:26.52 --> 01:52:32.52
activity back to the book. The enemy fire became heavy about 50 Chinese were dug in against us

1050
01:52:32.52 --> 01:52:38.44
and they were serious about defending this place. Lee took his platoon off the road to extend

1051
01:52:38.44 --> 01:52:44.12
our firing line. Captain Wilcox came forward with Garcia and the big radio and set up in the ditch

1052
01:52:44.12 --> 01:52:51.08
just behind Kaiser. I marveled at his easy, ambling gate during firefights. He always stood up straight.

1053
01:52:52.12 --> 01:52:59.96
He's like JP. The static of the SCR 300 radio outed added to the pounding of our own

1054
01:52:59.96 --> 01:53:07.88
machine guns and bars. Rifles cracked. Johnson's mortar bumped out HEs and enemy bullets

1055
01:53:07.88 --> 01:53:15.24
zing through the air and spun off chips of boulders. Soon came the urgent cries. Corman, oh God,

1056
01:53:15.24 --> 01:53:22.68
Corman! And the fear came. As it did to me on the onset of every fight, the Corman cries,

1057
01:53:22.68 --> 01:53:29.32
the booming explosions and the wine of bullets blood-trenched parkas pierced God, not this time. Please.

1058
01:53:30.92 --> 01:53:35.64
Platoon Sergeant King from Taylor's Platoon Crouch amongst some large boulders above me.

1059
01:53:35.64 --> 01:53:39.72
He shouted down that there was a machine gun near the spike of rocks that marked the Chinese main

1060
01:53:39.72 --> 01:53:48.12
position. I wield myself to climb up and get a better look. The fears submerged and the cold was

1061
01:53:48.12 --> 01:53:59.16
forgotten. Overcome that fear take action. Now they continue in this little firefight and then finally

1062
01:53:59.16 --> 01:54:03.88
we get enough talked about them before we get some air support some raincoirers,

1063
01:54:03.88 --> 01:54:09.96
but we get some marines on the ground that are pilots. What we now call Anglico, the marines are on

1064
01:54:09.96 --> 01:54:15.32
the ground, these are fighter pilots that go out and do infantry work and call for fire and so here

1065
01:54:15.32 --> 01:54:20.12
we go back to the book Bob Wilson brought in the course airs that were on station to cover our

1066
01:54:20.12 --> 01:54:25.56
advance. I called down to Burst to lay down a round of white phosphorus to mark the Chinese guns

1067
01:54:25.56 --> 01:54:31.72
and the flyers came in on the calm of white smoke. They flew in low barely above us. They're

1068
01:54:31.72 --> 01:54:37.96
great racketing noise overpowered all other sounds as they flashed by. On the first passes they

1069
01:54:37.96 --> 01:54:42.68
fired the machine guns and cannons. These had a little effect the Chinese were dug into well.

1070
01:54:43.56 --> 01:54:51.72
They followed with a napalm run, a spectacle of awesome and terrible beauty. The pods slid

1071
01:54:51.72 --> 01:54:58.52
from the planes tumbled across the ground that exploded. Black smoke billowed and red flames

1072
01:54:58.52 --> 01:55:03.96
leaped against the white snow and seconds later we felt the blast of heat that consumed the ground

1073
01:55:03.96 --> 01:55:11.64
200 yards away. Chinese soldiers were a flame running about in frenzied circles. They threw

1074
01:55:11.64 --> 01:55:19.24
themselves flailing into the snow. There was sudden silence. The Chinese ceased fire and her own weapons

1075
01:55:19.24 --> 01:55:24.92
were quiet. We were stunned by the power of that close end flaming strike.

1076
01:55:24.92 --> 01:55:32.52
200 yards away. That's not a big distance. I might seem like a big distance. That is not a

1077
01:55:32.52 --> 01:55:37.16
big distance when you're in an airplane and you're coming down to drop Napalm and kill a bunch of

1078
01:55:37.16 --> 01:55:44.20
people. That's a tiny distance. Marine Corps pilots is getting after it. It's called danger close

1079
01:55:44.20 --> 01:55:49.24
by the way. So if you're going to call in an air strike that's close to your positions. You have

1080
01:55:49.24 --> 01:55:54.52
to say on the radio. You say danger close. Meaning look, I know it's close by. You've got to do it.

1081
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:05.72
Go in. So they snifled out that one but guess what? The Chinese are far from done.

1082
01:56:05.72 --> 01:56:09.32
Back to the book, the Chinese showed that they would not hibernate from the war because of the

1083
01:56:09.32 --> 01:56:14.92
cold weather. The farther we advanced, the stiffer was their resistance. The hills continued to

1084
01:56:14.92 --> 01:56:20.84
grow steeper and each climb we made and combed with the heavy clothing became its own ordeal.

1085
01:56:21.88 --> 01:56:28.28
Most of our fights were put to insized, Kaiser or Lee or Taylor maneuvering up a slippy slippery

1086
01:56:28.28 --> 01:56:32.92
snow-covered slope to dislodge a force of Chinese who fired at us down the road.

1087
01:56:33.80 --> 01:56:37.32
So as they're moving down this road, they're just having to go into the high ground all the time and

1088
01:56:37.32 --> 01:56:48.44
take out the Chinese. Here's a cool little anecdotal story. They get pinned down and Colonel Davis is

1089
01:56:48.44 --> 01:56:53.64
there and they're trying to figure out what to do. I'm going to the book. Colonel Davis was at the

1090
01:56:53.64 --> 01:56:59.32
head of our column with Captain Wilcox. When the Chinese opened up from across the chasm 300 yards

1091
01:56:59.32 --> 01:57:04.84
away, the skipper called me up front. Can you knock out those guns? Captain Wilcox asked?

1092
01:57:04.84 --> 01:57:10.52
He and the Colonel crouched their acknowledgement of machine gun slugs that tore into the slope above

1093
01:57:10.52 --> 01:57:17.08
our heads. Yes, sir. I answered crouching alongside my two commanders. So there's a machine gun up on the

1094
01:57:17.08 --> 01:57:21.96
hill and they can't get it with their guns but they wanted to get his mortar tubes up there

1095
01:57:21.96 --> 01:57:27.80
and then drop mortar rounds on the machine gun position. So he yells out to his runner. So his runners

1096
01:57:27.80 --> 01:57:33.72
is the guy that spreads word. He runs out to his runner. Kelly, bring up Johnson's gun. I commanded

1097
01:57:33.72 --> 01:57:40.44
Hugo was with Kaiser's platoon leading the column that day. They were just behind the bend.

1098
01:57:40.44 --> 01:57:46.20
I sir snapped my runner in a way to impress the Colonel. Colonel Davis and Captain Wilcox

1099
01:57:46.20 --> 01:57:51.08
continued to scan the opposite slope. 11 o'clock said the Colonel indicating slight movement

1100
01:57:51.08 --> 01:57:56.28
in an outcrapping of boulders. Yes, sir. I haven't. I told my Colonel as I located the enemy

1101
01:57:56.28 --> 01:58:00.76
machine gun through my own binoculars. And another one at 10 o'clock 50 yards higher. Sir,

1102
01:58:00.76 --> 01:58:07.48
good eyes Lieutenant said Colonel Davis. There was a sudden commotion behind us. The sound of

1103
01:58:07.48 --> 01:58:13.56
marine singing as they double timed up the road. Kelly was leading the mortar men forward.

1104
01:58:14.28 --> 01:58:20.68
And he had them sounding cadence with his parody of an army marking song, song, marching song,

1105
01:58:20.68 --> 01:58:27.32
sound off. How can a mortar man survive following a man who's six foot five sound off?

1106
01:58:27.32 --> 01:58:33.40
Put your rifles and machine guns away. The 60 mortars are all in the way. Sound off. Sound off.

1107
01:58:33.40 --> 01:58:38.44
So they're in a firefight. They're pinned down. And these guys come running up the road singing

1108
01:58:38.44 --> 01:58:42.36
cadence. And by the way, I forgot to mention this that Owen is six foot five. So that's where

1109
01:58:42.36 --> 01:58:49.56
they're talking about. There was no ditch. So Hugo could not take cover from enemy fire while

1110
01:58:49.56 --> 01:58:54.60
setting up his gun. He and Dean Westburg spread the bipod on the rear of on the rear edge of

1111
01:58:54.60 --> 01:59:01.000
the flat open road surface. I stood behind the gun as they work quickly. The volume of bullets

1112
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:08.12
increased. 11 o'clock Hugo I said, give me three five zero. I fired a tracer from my shoulder.

1113
01:59:08.12 --> 01:59:14.44
Westburg had a mortar round ready. Hugo with his sharp shooters eye spotted the target and said

1114
01:59:15.08 --> 01:59:21.24
three five oh plus a hair. He laid the tube in the direction of the machine gun and cranked his elevation.

1115
01:59:21.24 --> 01:59:26.76
Fire, he said to Westburg, the round fumped out and we followed its arc ignoring the Chinese bullets

1116
01:59:26.76 --> 01:59:31.56
that were bouncing off the frozen surface of the road and the slope behind us. The first round

1117
01:59:31.56 --> 01:59:39.000
was a direct hit. God bless you Hugo Johnson. Captain Wilcox called out for the platoon to continue

1118
01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:44.12
the march. Colonel David approached the gun. He had a big smile. You tell your men they're shooting

1119
01:59:44.12 --> 01:59:50.36
it right on lieutenant. He said, he glanced at our choir director Kelly and added, but tell him

1120
01:59:50.36 --> 01:59:59.88
that their sing is way off key. Like I said, even having a good time in madness of fire flights.

1121
01:59:59.88 --> 02:00:05.08
The cold is getting brutal. Back to the book, we seldom removed our knitted gloves that we

1122
02:00:05.08 --> 02:00:10.68
wore under the canvas mittens. Bear fingers we found froze to metal. They froze to weapons,

1123
02:00:10.68 --> 02:00:16.44
bayonets, buckles, whatever we touched. The cold forced the corpsmen to change their way of

1124
02:00:16.44 --> 02:00:22.20
doing business. With the first sounds of a firefight they would take several serets of moraphone

1125
02:00:22.20 --> 02:00:27.80
and put them into their mouths. This kept the moraphone liquid until the serets were jabbed into

1126
02:00:27.80 --> 02:00:34.60
the wounded man's flesh to relieve his pain. The corpsmen were the only ones who worked with

1127
02:00:34.60 --> 02:00:39.88
bare hands in the severe cold and they found a way to keep their fingers nimble while attending

1128
02:00:39.88 --> 02:00:46.76
two wounded man. The heat of the man's blood did the trick or his guts as they were stuffed

1129
02:00:46.76 --> 02:01:03.56
back into his belly. Freezing cold. Back to the book, despite our efforts to keep the men in clean

1130
02:01:03.56 --> 02:01:08.76
dry socks we were losing the fight against frostbite which resulted from damp cold feet.

1131
02:01:08.76 --> 02:01:14.52
The men would complain of pains or numbness in their feet and when they limped badly we sent

1132
02:01:14.52 --> 02:01:21.000
them to batallion aid station. Many never returned. Some had waited too long to turn themselves in

1133
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:27.80
and by the time the doctors saw them their toes had become purplish black and had to be amputated.

1134
02:01:29.80 --> 02:01:34.68
Because the ground was frozen hard digging good fighting holes was nearly impossible.

1135
02:01:34.68 --> 02:01:42.12
Digging in became a matter of chipping a shallow pit in the unyielding earth beneath the snow

1136
02:01:42.12 --> 02:01:48.76
then barricading it with rocks or tree branches. If any dead Chinese were found on the hill

1137
02:01:48.76 --> 02:01:55.96
we added their stiff corpses to the barricades. To make level places for their guns the

1138
02:01:55.96 --> 02:02:05.80
mortament took turns at the concrete like dirt within trenching tools and combat knives.

1139
02:02:06.60 --> 02:02:15.48
And they're continuing in this freezing cold. They get to a point where they're

1140
02:02:18.04 --> 02:02:23.72
in sort of an open area and we'll go to the book. The Chinese maneuvered down from the red

1141
02:02:23.72 --> 02:02:29.96
giants all around us. They ran across the snow in squad columns then formed firing lines among

1142
02:02:29.96 --> 02:02:38.28
the boulders or prone in the snow. Chinese mortars began to fall on us in the CP which was 50 yards

1143
02:02:38.28 --> 02:02:45.96
or us and the CP which was 50 yards behind us. Around exploded close by and lifted me off the ground.

1144
02:02:45.96 --> 02:02:51.24
I was days for a while and when full awareness returned Kelly had me by the arm leading me

1145
02:02:51.24 --> 02:02:57.000
toward the CP. Where we'd go and Kelly I didn't understand why we were heading away from the line.

1146
02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.64
Get a corpsman to look at you. I thought you were a goner back there. He pointed to my

1147
02:03:01.64 --> 02:03:07.16
park of flapping around my knees. It had strapped in the holes in it. They don't get closer than

1148
02:03:07.16 --> 02:03:12.60
that deterring your balls off. It's a good thing you got me around Lieutenant. The corpsman at the

1149
02:03:12.60 --> 02:03:18.68
CP was far too busy with the seriously wounded to tend to my mild concussion. The casualties

1150
02:03:18.68 --> 02:03:26.20
lay in blanket covered rose. Dr. Skis Davis and Toppil, those of the corpsman went from one to the

1151
02:03:26.20 --> 02:03:31.96
other. They jabbed Moraphine, slowed bleeding, cleaned out holes, blasts and flashed, patched them

1152
02:03:31.96 --> 02:03:37.56
and wrapped them as best they could. The corpsman had their mouth filled with mouths filled with

1153
02:03:37.56 --> 02:03:44.68
serets of Moraphine and their bare hands were bloody. When they worked with enemy mores exploding,

1154
02:03:44.68 --> 02:03:50.52
bullets stabbing the air too feet above them. Week frightened voices called for their help.

1155
02:03:51.72 --> 02:03:56.52
Doc Mickons from 1st Patoon took some shrapnel then a 25 and then a slug.

1156
02:03:57.56 --> 02:04:03.08
In the leg where he was patching the wounded in action on Woody Taylor's line. The stretcher bearer's

1157
02:04:03.08 --> 02:04:08.92
drag Mickons to the CP and lay them in the line of casualties. Next to him, damming the Chinese

1158
02:04:08.92 --> 02:04:14.84
and his Arkansas draw was Sergeant King who had been blasted by grenades and hit by a burp gun.

1159
02:04:15.80 --> 02:04:20.44
Paul Rendon, a machine gunner with the Patoon lay there too, a leg shot up.

1160
02:04:21.64 --> 02:04:28.68
The first Patoon's, the first Patoon was being rapidly depleted and was having a hell of a fight

1161
02:04:28.68 --> 02:04:36.92
holding their end to their perimeter. So these guys were, you know, perimeter like I said in

1162
02:04:36.92 --> 02:04:41.24
sort of an open area and the Chinese just come down and they're, you know, full on attack on them,

1163
02:04:41.24 --> 02:04:47.16
full on. Back to the book, the afternoon light faded and we were worried about whether the ammo

1164
02:04:47.16 --> 02:04:54.12
would run out. The Chinese had fully encircled us. Their volume of fire was just enough to keep us

1165
02:04:54.12 --> 02:05:01.64
pinned down. They would wait for dark than swarm over our lines. They had plenty of people to do the

1166
02:05:01.64 --> 02:05:09.88
job. Our bandettes were fixed and our grenades ready. Every man had a target sector and we kept

1167
02:05:09.88 --> 02:05:18.92
fire discipline to conserve ammo. We began to settle in and wait for dark. As bullets zinged,

1168
02:05:18.92 --> 02:05:24.20
grenades exploded and Marines cried for help. Someone yelled out that cop captain Wilcox had

1169
02:05:24.20 --> 02:05:29.40
been hit. He had taken a bullet to the face and a piece of shrapnel and shattered his arm.

1170
02:05:29.40 --> 02:05:35.88
Joe Kersaba took over as our skipper. As soon as we heard about the captain we ran to the

1171
02:05:35.88 --> 02:05:42.52
CP, we found him there as head wrapped in a big white ball of a bandage unable to speak. His blood

1172
02:05:42.52 --> 02:05:49.000
soaks sleeve dangled beside him. He kept struggling to get on his feet when the docks put him down

1173
02:05:49.64 --> 02:05:55.40
on his spread out poncho. After a while the morphine kicked in and the skipper nodded off

1174
02:05:55.40 --> 02:06:02.04
groaning softly. Before they stabilized the line around us, the Chinese pushed the first

1175
02:06:02.04 --> 02:06:10.04
platoon back almost to the CP. So you got the platoon. The CP is the kind of like the brains of the

1176
02:06:10.04 --> 02:06:15.88
unit. They got the different pltunes or out in a perimeter in 360 degrees and in the center of that

1177
02:06:15.88 --> 02:06:20.68
you got the command post, the CP and you have the radio men in there. You have the people that are

1178
02:06:20.68 --> 02:06:25.64
going to do fire support, maybe the mortar sections in there and then you have the leadership

1179
02:06:25.64 --> 02:06:32.12
is in that CP. But now we start to see that the pltunes are getting pushed back towards the CP.

1180
02:06:32.12 --> 02:06:38.92
They're losing their perimeter. Just as Joe Kersaba came in to take over command to the company,

1181
02:06:38.92 --> 02:06:43.48
Roti Taylor stormed in demanding that we get the hell out of here. The gooks have all the

1182
02:06:43.48 --> 02:06:48.04
high ground. They got us surrounded. He boomed. They're going to pick us to pieces tonight.

1183
02:06:48.04 --> 02:06:55.48
Joe Kersaba answered him quietly. We need air support to run at your fairs for us. Then we might

1184
02:06:55.48 --> 02:07:00.52
be able to make a break for the road. They better get to work mighty fast said, Woody, we only have

1185
02:07:00.52 --> 02:07:05.80
a few minutes of daylight left. So there's Joe Kersaba's keeping it cool. Again, World War II vet

1186
02:07:06.52 --> 02:07:14.28
now just out here getting after it. And that's what they need. So what they need is they need

1187
02:07:14.28 --> 02:07:19.96
the coarserers to come in, which if you don't know the coarserers on awesome aircraft, World War II

1188
02:07:19.96 --> 02:07:25.32
vintage and you can tell them because they have very distinctive wings that have a distinctive

1189
02:07:25.32 --> 02:07:32.04
bend in them and they're very, very distinctive looking aircraft and obviously very good at

1190
02:07:32.04 --> 02:07:38.84
close air support. Back to the book, all afternoon, Joe Hedrick, the air controller, had attempted

1191
02:07:38.84 --> 02:07:43.48
to get a piece of the air support dedicated to the fifth marine. So there was air craft working on

1192
02:07:43.48 --> 02:07:48.20
another group of Marines, working for another group of Marines. Now in the remaining minutes of

1193
02:07:48.20 --> 02:07:56.76
daylight, he called a flight of four-care coarsers in search of action. Then he calls those things

1194
02:07:56.76 --> 02:08:02.12
and gets them on the horn, calls them in and here we go. The four coarsers streaked in a little

1195
02:08:02.12 --> 02:08:08.60
bubble us pointing themselves at the Chinese positions less than 100 yards away. They drop

1196
02:08:08.60 --> 02:08:14.20
their big earth shaking bombs and they skate the long deep valley with rockets and heavy

1197
02:08:14.20 --> 02:08:23.32
caliber slugs. The Chinese took cover and we moved out. So that's cover move once again.

1198
02:08:23.72 --> 02:08:27.08
All they needed to do to get out of the situation was they needed someone to cover for their

1199
02:08:27.08 --> 02:08:30.92
movement. That's what they needed and they couldn't supply it themselves. They're shooting uphill.

1200
02:08:30.92 --> 02:08:36.84
Didn't have the firepower. Income the coarsers to get after it and give them cover to move.

1201
02:08:36.84 --> 02:08:43.64
Back to the book, I lost ground in that day. The lad who had tried hard to be a good combat

1202
02:08:43.64 --> 02:08:48.84
marine. He was running toward me carrying a helmet filled with grenades taken from the wounded

1203
02:08:48.84 --> 02:08:54.84
when a bullet tore through his throat. The shot didn't knock him down at first, just through his

1204
02:08:54.84 --> 02:09:01.24
head back and I saw a fountain of blood spurt from his neck. He staggered a few steps, then fell

1205
02:09:01.24 --> 02:09:07.72
face forward in the snow which quickly turned red. When I got to him, he was already dead.

1206
02:09:10.44 --> 02:09:15.80
It took hours more for a baker one seven to make its way the mile down the road.

1207
02:09:16.60 --> 02:09:22.12
Colonel Davis brought elements of Charlie Company out to meet us. We loaded our dead and wounded

1208
02:09:22.12 --> 02:09:29.24
on waiting trucks and sent them back to you down knee. The Chinese had cut off the MSR that's a

1209
02:09:29.24 --> 02:09:36.92
main supply route between you Domny and Haga Ruiri, the Colonel and Ford Bus. So now they are

1210
02:09:36.92 --> 02:09:43.48
truly trapped. On the march back into the you Domny perimeter, past midnight, the men were silent,

1211
02:09:44.36 --> 02:09:52.20
spent from this cold brutal day. And Captain Wilcox had been a good skipper.

1212
02:09:52.20 --> 02:09:59.64
When they get there, Lee was waiting for us when we staggered into you Domny perimeter.

1213
02:10:00.36 --> 02:10:05.88
Many of the men limped with the first stages of frostbite and there were some walking wounded

1214
02:10:05.88 --> 02:10:12.92
who had elected this day with the company. Undisguised tears ran down Lee's face when he saw

1215
02:10:12.92 --> 02:10:21.24
the column make its way in. And that was the reason that Lee wasn't with them was because he

1216
02:10:21.24 --> 02:10:27.48
literally got ordered to that he couldn't go because his arm was becoming infected. And he was

1217
02:10:27.48 --> 02:10:33.56
he could not. They would not let him go. And so he's there and undisguised tears ran down his

1218
02:10:33.56 --> 02:10:39.40
face as he saw the column make its way in. Joe Kersobber formed us up at first light while the

1219
02:10:39.40 --> 02:10:45.000
course airs were blazing at enemy hills. He told us that we were going to aid going to the

1220
02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:51.56
aid of Charlie Company which had been posted on Turkey Hill to guard the MSR. Last night after

1221
02:10:51.56 --> 02:10:56.68
we marched away from that area that Chinese had poured out of the hills and surrounded Charlie.

1222
02:10:57.24 --> 02:11:01.96
Charlie was fighting for its life when we went to pull them out. So there's a

1223
02:11:01.96 --> 02:11:08.36
small company of Marines, Charlie Company, and they are surrounded.

1224
02:11:08.36 --> 02:11:18.44
They go up and one of the, one of the Abel Company, so you got Abel Baker and Charlie,

1225
02:11:18.44 --> 02:11:25.48
Abel Company sets up on the flank and then Baker also patrols up and kind of sets up to

1226
02:11:25.48 --> 02:11:30.52
to come to their aid back to the book. Through my binoculars I had a good view of Charlie's perimeter.

1227
02:11:30.52 --> 02:11:37.32
400 yards away. They were in a tight circle, not more than 75 yards across halfway up the slope

1228
02:11:37.32 --> 02:11:43.000
of Turkey Hill. Chinese machine guns and rifles infested the hill around them firing at any

1229
02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Marine who moved. Charlie's people were thoroughly pinned down. So picture this a little circle.

1230
02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.36
See, all your whole company, maybe there's a hundred, maybe there could be a hundred,

1231
02:11:52.36 --> 02:11:55.80
fifty but I think they've taken a bunch of wounded at this point. They got a hundred guys in a

1232
02:11:55.80 --> 02:12:00.84
little, seventy, five meter circle. And you're all pinned down and no matter every time you move,

1233
02:12:00.84 --> 02:12:06.52
every time it gets stuck up you're getting shot at. Back to the book, Lee put his machine guns

1234
02:12:06.52 --> 02:12:11.16
on the Chinese who were firing into Charlie's perimeter from the lower slope. My three mortars

1235
02:12:11.16 --> 02:12:16.52
had the same target. Abel's machine gun and mortars rake the hill above the perimeter. Soon our

1236
02:12:16.52 --> 02:12:21.40
tracer's lying the sky and puffs of black smoke from the mortars dotted the rocky hill.

1237
02:12:22.04 --> 02:12:27.32
Then the big shells from artillery and the battalions 81 started to fall and the hill rocked

1238
02:12:27.32 --> 02:12:35.32
with their explosions. Chinese soldier's scurried for cover. My classmate pay attention to this.

1239
02:12:35.32 --> 02:12:41.56
My classmate Jin Stemple led Abel's assault down the ridge line and into the Chinese.

1240
02:12:42.36 --> 02:12:48.12
The enemy soldiers had their heads down from the heavy covering fire once again covering fire

1241
02:12:48.12 --> 02:12:54.84
and Stemple's platoon tore into them. Through the binoculars I observed one squad of

1242
02:12:54.84 --> 02:13:02.76
Temples Marines led by a giant of a man in a flapping parka who swung a huge double-headed axe.

1243
02:13:02.76 --> 02:13:10.20
The Chinese soldiers seeing this great maniacal devil charged at them branding,

1244
02:13:10.20 --> 02:13:14.44
brandishing a bloody axe abandoned their positions in terror.

1245
02:13:16.44 --> 02:13:23.96
So there you have it. I never, I never, I don't even know where you get a battle axe in the

1246
02:13:23.96 --> 02:13:31.32
Missed the Korean War but this Marine right here attacks the Chinese, not with grenades, not with a

1247
02:13:31.32 --> 02:13:35.56
bar, not with a machine gun, he attacks with a freaking battle axe.

1248
02:13:40.52 --> 02:13:44.92
Back to the book the Chinese quickly lifted their siege of Charlie Company and made a rapid retreat

1249
02:13:44.92 --> 02:13:51.48
from Turkey hill. As they fled Abel companies down hill assault they had to cross baker's line of fire.

1250
02:13:51.88 --> 02:13:57.48
Woody Taylor's platoon had come up to extend our line and every weapon we had was trained on the

1251
02:13:57.48 --> 02:14:02.84
Chinese as they ran to the protecting slopes on the other side of the valley. Turkey shoot at

1252
02:14:02.84 --> 02:14:07.88
Turkey hill are people called it. We were at rapid fire with the mortars and machine gun,

1253
02:14:07.88 --> 02:14:13.40
and machine guns the bars, and the rifles even co-vars rocket launcher.

1254
02:14:14.20 --> 02:14:18.60
A few Chinese made it all the way across the gauntlet of exploding flame and steel.

1255
02:14:19.40 --> 02:14:24.44
They dropped and heaps even before the Australian planes came down on them. We hadn't worked with

1256
02:14:24.44 --> 02:14:29.80
the Australians before and they were out to prove that they were gun-ho is our own Marine core pilots.

1257
02:14:30.60 --> 02:14:36.20
They came roaring low along the valley from behind us and when they passed above these glowing

1258
02:14:36.20 --> 02:14:41.96
pink vest they dropped even closer to the ground. They're they're low enough to cut off the

1259
02:14:41.96 --> 02:14:47.64
Qing's pig tails, Kelly quipped. The planes had their blood, their guns blazing and the

1260
02:14:47.64 --> 02:14:53.48
Chinese went down in bunches. The Australians made two passes at the end of their second

1261
02:14:53.48 --> 02:15:01.000
low level assault. There were no Chinese soldiers left to shoot at. It took almost every able body

1262
02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:07.000
man that Charlie Company had to bring down their dead and wounded. Their overnight defense of

1263
02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:19.08
Turkey hill had cost dearly. And they got one more rescue mission basically to do. There was a

1264
02:15:19.08 --> 02:15:33.16
Fox company is now in another situation in a horrible scenario and first Baker 17 needs to get to them.

1265
02:15:33.72 --> 02:15:41.80
And it is a treacherous, treacherous movement and they decide, you remember early in the book,

1266
02:15:41.80 --> 02:15:46.12
you said, you know, we weren't used to night fighting. They'd mostly worked during the day.

1267
02:15:46.12 --> 02:15:51.40
Well, they decide that they need to do this at night. So they go on this patrol at night.

1268
02:15:52.20 --> 02:15:56.60
Going back to the book. Under the heavy parkours our bodies

1269
02:15:56.60 --> 02:16:02.28
swedded with the strain but our hands and feet were frozen numb. The wind borne cold attacked

1270
02:16:02.28 --> 02:16:07.72
with terrible fury. When we stopped for bearings we stood silent and motionless.

1271
02:16:08.60 --> 02:16:13.000
Because we needed to maintain silence we could not slap our hands against our sides or

1272
02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:19.16
stomp our feet for circulation. The cold nodded our toes and fingers and ate into our bodies.

1273
02:16:20.12 --> 02:16:26.04
The sweat we generated while climbing froze against our skin. We shivered violently,

1274
02:16:26.04 --> 02:16:30.20
men muttered through their clenched teeth. We somehow got dimmed or freezing a death here.

1275
02:16:32.60 --> 02:16:37.48
And they pushed on. I returned to the side of the column. Many men had collapsed in the snow

1276
02:16:37.48 --> 02:16:44.84
curled into balls like Eskimo dogs. NCOs moved along the fallen, prodding and kicking, urging

1277
02:16:44.84 --> 02:16:49.64
them to their feet. I collided with another Marine, churning forward through the snow. Both of us

1278
02:16:49.64 --> 02:16:54.60
fell and as we weirdly recovered I realized that I had knocked down Colonel Davis.

1279
02:16:55.80 --> 02:16:59.96
What's the hold-up lieutenant? Was all my battalion commander said that he continued breaking

1280
02:16:59.96 --> 02:17:06.20
through the snow to the head of the column. Time had no meaning. We labored through infinite

1281
02:17:06.20 --> 02:17:13.000
darkness and ghostly clouds of snow over an icy path that rose in fell but seemed to lead nowhere.

1282
02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:21.96
We saw only the back of a man's head, a hunched figure in a long, shapeless parka whose every

1283
02:17:21.96 --> 02:17:32.68
tortured step was an act of will. We carried on with the only strength that was left to us.

1284
02:17:32.68 --> 02:17:48.12
Marine Corps discipline. They finally get within range after this brutal freezing march.

1285
02:17:49.64 --> 02:17:53.56
And here we go the night exploded with the flash and sound of the fight.

1286
02:17:54.44 --> 02:17:59.32
The Marines had the advantage of surprise and momentum. They fought with fierce energy

1287
02:17:59.32 --> 02:18:04.92
now released from hours of cold and misery. The Chinese could do little more than try to escape.

1288
02:18:06.52 --> 02:18:12.12
Many of them were unarmed and most ran off to the south so the the Chinese run.

1289
02:18:13.48 --> 02:18:19.32
There's some firing, there's some shooting but it's pretty much a route because they had gone

1290
02:18:19.32 --> 02:18:23.16
at night and they had pushed hard and they had that surprise and violence of action.

1291
02:18:23.16 --> 02:18:30.60
Back to the book, Dawn arrived, Gray and cold and we jumped off the second phase of the

1292
02:18:30.60 --> 02:18:36.36
breakthrough, able and Baker attacked online headed out for Fox Hill a thousand yards away.

1293
02:18:37.64 --> 02:18:42.76
Minutes after we moved out, Kaiser's puttune on the left walked into heavy small arms

1294
02:18:42.76 --> 02:18:49.16
machine gun fire from a ridge on his flank. The 60s responded with HE on the ridge and Kaiser's

1295
02:18:49.16 --> 02:18:54.36
people broke through the deep snow to mount the hill. When they near the ridge line we lifted

1296
02:18:54.36 --> 02:18:58.44
mortar fire and the platoon drove through the enemy's position on its own firepower,

1297
02:18:58.44 --> 02:19:02.76
cover and move added again. We were astonished by our first view of Fox Hill.

1298
02:19:03.40 --> 02:19:09.16
The snow field that led up to the embattled company's position was covered with hundreds of dead

1299
02:19:09.16 --> 02:19:15.96
Chinese soldiers. Many of them seemed to sleep under blankets of drifted snow but their bodies were

1300
02:19:15.96 --> 02:19:24.20
frozen in spasms of pain. There were jumbles of corpses in padded green uniforms. A white

1301
02:19:24.20 --> 02:19:29.32
clad column had fallen in the formation that had attracted the attention of Fox companies'

1302
02:19:29.32 --> 02:19:36.84
machine gunners. Creators of dirt and snow made by the big guns were rimmed with bodies and parts

1303
02:19:36.84 --> 02:19:43.24
of men. Thick bands of dead Chinese lay at the base of Fox Company's perimeter.

1304
02:19:43.24 --> 02:19:50.84
We stood in wonder. Men bowed their heads in prayer, some felt to their knees,

1305
02:19:50.84 --> 02:19:59.56
other breath quiet oaths of disbelief. Tears came to the eyes of raggedy marines who had

1306
02:19:59.56 --> 02:20:05.96
endured bitter cold and savage battle to reach this place of suffering and courage.

1307
02:20:05.96 --> 02:20:15.08
Some one let loose a wild cheer and broke forward in a jubilant run. Across the snow covered

1308
02:20:15.08 --> 02:20:20.68
and corpse-filled battlefield, the marines of Fox Company waved brightly colored banners.

1309
02:20:20.68 --> 02:20:25.48
The blue yellow and red remnants of the parachute drops that had sustained them for nearly a week.

1310
02:20:27.16 --> 02:20:32.76
Around their perimeter, Fox Company had constructed barricades of frozen Chinese bodies.

1311
02:20:32.76 --> 02:20:41.56
From behind these walls of the, from behind these walls of dead, the marines had mounted their

1312
02:20:41.56 --> 02:20:45.72
weapons and maintained a fight against an enemy whose numbers never ceased.

1313
02:20:47.16 --> 02:20:51.80
Now the men of Fox Company arose from behind these gruesome piles to join us.

1314
02:20:51.80 --> 02:20:58.76
Arms slings and bloods soaked compresses were common among them. Men hobbled about with

1315
02:20:58.76 --> 02:21:06.68
makeshift leg splints, all hands were haggard and dirty as were we. We exchanged profane

1316
02:21:06.68 --> 02:21:11.24
greetings that did not conceal the love that we marines felt for each other.

1317
02:21:12.92 --> 02:21:17.000
Some came out and marines appeared along the skylines to the north.

1318
02:21:18.04 --> 02:21:24.28
Then we saw marines marching down the MSR towards us. There were columns of riflemen at first,

1319
02:21:24.28 --> 02:21:30.84
followed by a long trail of vehicle and vehicles and artillery pieces. Our corsairs swooped in

1320
02:21:30.84 --> 02:21:37.32
close, their crooked wings wagging and salute. The fifth and seventh marines had broken out of

1321
02:21:37.32 --> 02:21:49.88
you down knee. Now they broke out. They have a path but they still have to go 14 miles to get out of there.

1322
02:21:49.88 --> 02:21:56.76
Back to the book, all the platoon sergeants had been hit. As were most of the squad leaders,

1323
02:21:56.76 --> 02:22:02.20
we had corpoles and private stepping into leadership billets but they were combat experience marines

1324
02:22:02.20 --> 02:22:08.36
and they knew the work. The marine column that came out of the besieged, you down knee,

1325
02:22:08.36 --> 02:22:13.80
had hundreds of jeeps, ambulances and trucks as well as the big guns of the artillery regiment.

1326
02:22:14.44 --> 02:22:19.24
Many of the trucks were filled with wounded men and some were stacked with the corpses of our own

1327
02:22:19.24 --> 02:22:24.84
killed in action. The walking wounded, so now you got to picture this column, like almost like a mad

1328
02:22:24.84 --> 02:22:31.24
max looking column. The walking wounded who could carry a weapon were turned to as riflemen to protect

1329
02:22:31.24 --> 02:22:38.12
the column. Every man who could walk, hobble or limp was ordered off the trucks. The only riders were

1330
02:22:38.12 --> 02:22:45.80
those serious cases, the gut wounds and blinded men along with severe leg wounds and men with

1331
02:22:45.80 --> 02:22:52.12
frostbite so bad that they would need amputation. Many of the wounded died in the trucks,

1332
02:22:52.12 --> 02:23:00.84
some froze to death and some were shot by the infiltrators. The 14 mile ride was three days

1333
02:23:00.84 --> 02:23:10.68
and nights of grim survival. The rifle companies of the 5th and 7th marine stayed in the hills

1334
02:23:10.68 --> 02:23:19.64
guarding the MSR as the column pulled in to Haggarooi. The garrison town came out to meet the

1335
02:23:19.64 --> 02:23:28.20
bedrackled marines who had run the 14 mile gauntlet of fire and ice. As the walking wounded

1336
02:23:28.20 --> 02:23:35.48
came within sight of the town, someone commanded them to fall into ranks. Maybe it was the

1337
02:23:35.48 --> 02:23:40.60
limping sergeant who gave the command the old salt who had set the defenses along bob fishers

1338
02:23:40.60 --> 02:23:45.88
stretch the column. It could have been fathered griffin or sergeant winged or corpora burr us,

1339
02:23:46.52 --> 02:23:54.60
or corporal Johnson. The wounded men and some who were unharmed but who staggered from exhaustion

1340
02:23:55.40 --> 02:24:01.16
formed up into three files, showed their weapons and marched in ragged step.

1341
02:24:01.16 --> 02:24:08.92
Slowly the tread of their thick rubber sold patch shoe packs on the icy road became a steady

1342
02:24:08.92 --> 02:24:18.36
sure cadence and the haggard and hurt marines put their heads high. Captain Wilcox who couldn't

1343
02:24:18.36 --> 02:24:25.72
carry a weapon was in the forward ranks. His arm was in a huge cast and splinted so it was horizontal

1344
02:24:25.72 --> 02:24:32.20
to the deck. His head and face were a cocoon of bandages but holding himself erect he picked up

1345
02:24:32.20 --> 02:24:41.48
the cadence and marched standing straight into hogaroo rea. A battalion sergeant of the time

1346
02:24:41.48 --> 02:24:48.12
sergeant took time away from the hundreds of wounded men he tended in the aid station to witness

1347
02:24:48.12 --> 02:24:57.000
the columns arrival those bastards. Those magnificent bastards were the words the doctor used

1348
02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:01.32
to describe the worn and torn marines from you down name.

1349
02:25:07.48 --> 02:25:16.60
And I want you to I want you to picture that image that image of these hundreds of men just

1350
02:25:16.60 --> 02:25:24.84
battered wounded barely even able to walk frostbitten and they're meandering into camp and when

1351
02:25:24.84 --> 02:25:32.04
they get close someone says hey fall in and they fall into ranks and they begin to march.

1352
02:25:37.64 --> 02:25:44.60
Will that's human will and its human will under the power of leadership and he doesn't even

1353
02:25:44.60 --> 02:25:52.44
know who gave that order. Somebody said fall in the ranks it's the right thing to do and they do it.

1354
02:25:52.44 --> 02:26:01.88
They find more they find they dig deeper to fall into ranks and hold their heads high as they walk

1355
02:26:01.88 --> 02:26:11.48
back into town back to the book. Except for the road we had opened, Hagaroo rea was

1356
02:26:11.48 --> 02:26:16.60
under siege surrounded by many thousands of Chinese soldiers they had been held off by a battalion

1357
02:26:16.60 --> 02:26:22.04
of the first marines and hundreds of rear echelon people who had reverted to riflemen.

1358
02:26:23.40 --> 02:26:28.68
For three days and nights the cooks and bakers truck drivers and artillerymen

1359
02:26:28.68 --> 02:26:33.16
office, pinkies and technicians dug in alongside infantry marines.

1360
02:26:34.44 --> 02:26:39.48
They threw back every thrust the Chinese made against the Hagaroo rea perimeter.

1361
02:26:39.48 --> 02:26:46.20
American soldiers were there too army technical support people who picked up rifles and

1362
02:26:46.20 --> 02:26:52.68
bars and went up the hills and filled in the marine lines. Wherever there were gaps the artillery

1363
02:26:52.68 --> 02:26:59.40
threw in massive bombardments. During daylight hours the corsairs flew in low with bombs

1364
02:26:59.40 --> 02:27:06.76
rockets and napoms to help hold the attackers at bay. The three divisions of Chinese who tried to

1365
02:27:06.76 --> 02:27:13.24
isolate the fifth and seventh marines plus those had been at Fox Hill followed us south.

1366
02:27:14.44 --> 02:27:21.88
And now they added their numbers to the encirclement of Hagaroo rea. The single road the MSR

1367
02:27:21.88 --> 02:27:30.84
to Koto rea and our only way out was cut off. The hills that flanked that road were high and steep

1368
02:27:30.84 --> 02:27:36.36
and there were as many Chinese embedded in them as their head been at Udomni so they're still

1369
02:27:36.36 --> 02:27:41.56
completely surrounded. All this stuff is happening there's still surrounded.

1370
02:27:45.32 --> 02:27:50.04
The engineers with their heavy earth moving equipment had dynamited the frozen ground and

1371
02:27:50.04 --> 02:27:55.80
leveled an airfield large enough for cargo planes to fly in and out of Hagaroo rea. Air force

1372
02:27:55.80 --> 02:28:02.76
pilots flew in the big clumsy planes loaded with replacements, rations and ammunition.

1373
02:28:02.76 --> 02:28:10.20
For the return trip they filled the planes with the most seriously wounded. When they landed and

1374
02:28:10.20 --> 02:28:15.88
took off they had to fly low between the hills that lined the valley the planes became slow

1375
02:28:15.88 --> 02:28:22.20
moving targets for the Chinese guns and the hills and everyone that left Hagaroo rea was

1376
02:28:22.20 --> 02:28:28.84
perforated with bullet holes. The man on the ground marveled at the courage of the Air Force

1377
02:28:28.84 --> 02:28:34.52
pilots who kept flying in and out of there. So you got just cargo pilots flying into this place

1378
02:28:35.80 --> 02:28:50.20
insanity. Now, they're in a position on a perimeter because just because they survived all that they

1379
02:28:50.20 --> 02:28:54.12
still going to go back out in the whole perimeter. They get out to hold perimeter and here we go

1380
02:28:54.12 --> 02:28:59.80
back to the book through my glasses. I saw a calm of 15 riflemen marching toward us out of Hagaroo rea.

1381
02:29:00.76 --> 02:29:05.64
There were two files of them moving at a brisk pace alongside the road. But alongside both sides

1382
02:29:05.64 --> 02:29:11.64
of the road, they wore crisp white parkas and swung their arms smartly. Because they were clean

1383
02:29:11.64 --> 02:29:16.12
shape and an energetic way assumed they were fresh replacements flown in from the air strip.

1384
02:29:16.12 --> 02:29:20.28
We found out later that these clean and junky troops were royal British marines

1385
02:29:20.28 --> 02:29:27.72
who had fought their way into Hagaroo rea from the south. They too had found the MSR blocked

1386
02:29:27.72 --> 02:29:31.48
and they had punched through the Chinese forces far superior to them in number.

1387
02:29:33.72 --> 02:29:38.76
They were the 41st commando a unit that roughly compared in size to one of our own rifle

1388
02:29:38.76 --> 02:29:44.84
companies. Like us, these marines had suffered heavy casualties. The Royal Marine calm

1389
02:29:44.84 --> 02:29:51.08
halted and spread into ditches along the road near our CP. A freshly groomed young officer

1390
02:29:51.08 --> 02:29:57.72
strode toward Kelly, topple and me. With the young officer was a grizzled sergeant whose proper

1391
02:29:57.72 --> 02:30:03.88
military bearing could have come straight from the pages of kippling. The sergeant had a meticulously

1392
02:30:03.88 --> 02:30:10.44
trimmed broad mustache that would have stirred guinea bucklies out envy. Like the lieutenant,

1393
02:30:10.44 --> 02:30:16.76
the sergeant was dazzling clean and square to away. By binoculars hung around my neck which is

1394
02:30:16.76 --> 02:30:21.80
how the lieutenant distinguished me as an officer. Certainly there was little other difference

1395
02:30:21.80 --> 02:30:29.56
among Kelly and topple and me. Our partners were all stained with blood, food, gun oil, dirt.

1396
02:30:30.36 --> 02:30:36.28
Our filthy faces were matted with bristly beards that bore icicles of mucus and spittle.

1397
02:30:36.28 --> 02:30:43.16
The lieutenant concealed his disdain for our appearance, braced himself and delivered a broad

1398
02:30:43.16 --> 02:30:48.52
hand salute. I say sir, we've ordered to extend up a troll beyond your lines.

1399
02:30:50.12 --> 02:30:54.28
I'm to get up the covering machine guns and I would be most grateful for your suggestions.

1400
02:30:55.88 --> 02:31:01.32
I appreciated the British lieutenant's courtesy and if I possessed a rager, I would have

1401
02:31:01.32 --> 02:31:07.32
shaved on the spot to make myself more presentable. One of the reasons I included this because

1402
02:31:07.32 --> 02:31:11.88
people always ask me, you know, you ever worked with any other militarys and I've worked with

1403
02:31:11.88 --> 02:31:17.16
the British and people say you know how worthy. Well this is how the British are. The British

1404
02:31:17.16 --> 02:31:25.88
are outstanding. The British are so professional. It's so impressive. They're like impeccable.

1405
02:31:25.88 --> 02:31:28.52
Just the way they're described. That's the way the British are. That's the way the British

1406
02:31:28.52 --> 02:31:34.44
military is. They're outstanding. Back to the book, the Royal Marine Lieutenant in his sergeant

1407
02:31:34.44 --> 02:31:38.28
followed me to our machine gun positions and they checked out the fields of fire for their

1408
02:31:38.28 --> 02:31:43.48
own mission. As we walk the line together, we exchanged observations about fighting the Chinese.

1409
02:31:44.92 --> 02:31:51.96
The British lieutenant knew what he was talking about. Cock a little bit about the army units.

1410
02:31:51.96 --> 02:31:57.08
The army outfits that went east to the reservoir were hurriedly patched together and poorly

1411
02:31:57.08 --> 02:32:03.16
equipped for their mission. The artillery and tanks that were to support their advance were not

1412
02:32:03.16 --> 02:32:09.000
organized in time to accompany them when they moved north of how out of Hago Ruiri. The heavy

1413
02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:14.52
weapons that aided the Marine break out west of the reservoir were not there for the army.

1414
02:32:15.32 --> 02:32:20.68
And many of the soldiers in that fight had not yet received cold weather gear, scores of them

1415
02:32:20.68 --> 02:32:27.96
froze to death. It was the army's bad fortune too that a large number of its officers and

1416
02:32:27.96 --> 02:32:34.28
experienced NCOs had been knocked out of the battle at the onset. The two senior commanders

1417
02:32:34.28 --> 02:32:40.60
are Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel were killed at the front of their troops. Most of the

1418
02:32:40.60 --> 02:32:45.40
company commanders and platoon leaders went down in a short time the casualties of all ranks

1419
02:32:45.40 --> 02:32:52.84
outnumbered the able-bodied and some of the wounded had to be left behind. Platoons and squads

1420
02:32:52.84 --> 02:32:59.72
do enthalled to a few men and coalesced into small bands that fought until their ammunition was gone.

1421
02:33:00.84 --> 02:33:06.68
Those who could walk or crawl then made their way back across the frozen reservoir to the marine

1422
02:33:06.68 --> 02:33:13.80
lines at Hago Ruiri. For the soldiers it was a disastrous fight but it had one good effect.

1423
02:33:13.80 --> 02:33:19.000
The Chinese division that mold them was aimed at the attack on Hago Ruiri.

1424
02:33:19.72 --> 02:33:24.20
The fight the soldiers put up on the east side of the reservoir had slowed their advance

1425
02:33:25.16 --> 02:33:31.40
and that bought valuable time for the Marines. When the army survivors made their way into

1426
02:33:31.40 --> 02:33:37.56
Hago Ruiri, those who could still carry on were re-equipped and formed into a professional

1427
02:33:37.56 --> 02:33:43.16
battalion that became part of the first Marine division. They fought alongside us for the

1428
02:33:43.16 --> 02:33:57.16
remainder of the campaign. Now like I said at this point, they're still surrounded and they need to

1429
02:33:57.16 --> 02:34:03.64
now break out to get south to a town called Hung Nam where there's a port where they're going to be

1430
02:34:03.64 --> 02:34:08.68
extracted. They're going to be pulled out. Back to the book, one seven, Arbatalion and two seven

1431
02:34:08.68 --> 02:34:16.76
were to lead the break out from Coto Rhee. One seven was to take the high ground east of the road,

1432
02:34:16.76 --> 02:34:22.60
two seven the west, four miles on the MSR, the Chinese had blown out a bridge over a deep chasm.

1433
02:34:23.32 --> 02:34:29.72
The battalion of first Marines coming from the south would take the ground that commanded the other

1434
02:34:29.72 --> 02:34:37.08
side of that gap. Then the engineers were put in a new bridge beyond that was a full army division.

1435
02:34:37.08 --> 02:34:44.68
The third waiting to give us cover. After we cross the bridge, the army would take over the fighting.

1436
02:34:45.56 --> 02:34:52.28
All we needed to do was get a few more divisions, get through a few more divisions of Chinese soldiers.

1437
02:34:52.28 --> 02:34:57.96
So even on the division level, 10,000 were talking cover move, even on the division level. So it's

1438
02:34:57.96 --> 02:35:02.20
an individual thing. It's a squad thing. It's a platoon thing. It goes all the way up to the division

1439
02:35:02.20 --> 02:35:07.56
level because they need to have the cover of the army to get out of there. Here we go.

1440
02:35:08.60 --> 02:35:15.80
Able company went out in front. The Chinese, the waiting Chinese immediately put down a sheet of fire,

1441
02:35:15.80 --> 02:35:21.72
mortars, machine guns, burp guns, rifles. Able's casualties soon started to return.

1442
02:35:22.36 --> 02:35:28.44
We huddled against the blowing clouds of snow and prayed to God that Able wouldn't get so badly

1443
02:35:28.44 --> 02:35:35.08
mold that we would have to take their place. Our prayers were not answered.

1444
02:35:36.20 --> 02:35:41.96
Battalion ordered us to pass through Able and continue the attack. Although it was daylight,

1445
02:35:41.96 --> 02:35:48.20
we could barely see where we were going. The Chinese did not need to see us. There was only one

1446
02:35:48.20 --> 02:35:56.04
way for us to get at them straight along the road. They had our broach well marked and covered

1447
02:35:56.04 --> 02:36:01.08
with their weapons. As soon as we went past Able, the Chinese mortars began to drop and their

1448
02:36:01.08 --> 02:36:07.88
machine guns opened. The tracers were weird streaks of orange that flew out of the blinding snow clouds.

1449
02:36:09.32 --> 02:36:17.08
Our new corpsmen was quickly put to work. The Chinese were shooting down from a hill that flanked

1450
02:36:17.08 --> 02:36:22.44
woody as well as from straight ahead. Jody didn't want to send anyone up that hill,

1451
02:36:22.44 --> 02:36:27.08
fearing he would lose them in the heavy snow. You're just getting shot at them. There's clouds

1452
02:36:27.08 --> 02:36:31.40
up there at altitude and so you're just getting shot from snow. It's like a cloud that's shooting

1453
02:36:31.40 --> 02:36:37.32
machine gun fire at you. It's a nightmare. Back to the book we were getting nowhere. Joke or

1454
02:36:37.32 --> 02:36:43.24
Saba was standing alongside the road behind Lee's platoon. He called me over to him. Bullet

1455
02:36:43.24 --> 02:36:49.56
zingden's shrapnel wind around us but Joe stood straight and I stood with him. He had decided

1456
02:36:49.56 --> 02:36:54.44
to risk a move up the hill on a left flank. Move your platoon up there Joe. By the way,

1457
02:36:54.44 --> 02:36:58.44
at this point Joe had taken over a platoon. He was no longer in just in charge of the mortars. Now one

1458
02:36:58.44 --> 02:37:01.88
of the sergeants was in charge of the mortars. So he's now in charge of a rifle platoon.

1459
02:37:03.64 --> 02:37:07.40
Move your platoon up there. Joe he instructed me. See if you can take those guns out. They're

1460
02:37:07.40 --> 02:37:13.64
killing us. He spread out his mat and trace the route. Spread out his map and trace the route that I

1461
02:37:13.64 --> 02:37:22.68
was to follow. He fell silent. A Chinese bullet had found its target. Just below the rim of his

1462
02:37:22.68 --> 02:37:29.24
helmet in the center of his forehead. A small black hole appeared there. Joe Kersobba's dead eyes

1463
02:37:29.24 --> 02:37:36.60
stared at me for several seconds before he slump slowly to the ground. I caught him in my arms as

1464
02:37:36.60 --> 02:37:42.68
he fell and held him for a moment. Then I lowered him gently into the snow. Jesus God.

1465
02:37:43.96 --> 02:37:50.44
Joe Kersobba, my friend Joe who would help me so much, show me so much who had gone to bat for me

1466
02:37:50.44 --> 02:37:58.20
with Captain Wilcox who had been my big brother. Joe Kersobba, whom I loved.

1467
02:38:00.84 --> 02:38:06.20
Taking the mat from his mitten hands, I went forward to give it to Lee and informed him that

1468
02:38:06.20 --> 02:38:13.16
he was the new company commander. On the way over, I got on my walkie talkie to tell Betelian that Kersobba

1469
02:38:13.16 --> 02:38:21.80
was KIA. Their CP was close behind and the walkie talkie worked. Through the murk, I spotted Lee's

1470
02:38:21.80 --> 02:38:28.68
vest. He was walking the line behind his men who were prone in the snow covering 50 yards of front.

1471
02:38:28.68 --> 02:38:36.84
Luke Machini with the bar was with him. I felt alone without Kelly. The Chinese fire was passing

1472
02:38:36.84 --> 02:38:43.000
overhead high. The enemy couldn't see us either. Kersobba's dead. I told Lee, caught one in the head.

1473
02:38:43.56 --> 02:38:50.44
Damn. Was all Lee said in response. You're the new skipper I added. Giving him the map.

1474
02:38:51.32 --> 02:38:56.28
Joe told me to go up the hill on Woody's flank. See if I can get around those guns and take them

1475
02:38:56.28 --> 02:39:02.12
out. You still want me to do that. We must do something Lee said. They're killing us up from up there.

1476
02:39:02.68 --> 02:39:08.12
That's what Joe said. Yes, see what you can do. Is your radio working? Yeah, I just talked to Betelian

1477
02:39:08.12 --> 02:39:11.96
on it. Okay, let me know the situation when you make it and when you're ready to attack. If we can

1478
02:39:11.96 --> 02:39:17.08
get our artillery, I don't want you to run into friendly fire. I, I skipper, I said,

1479
02:39:18.12 --> 02:39:22.04
first Lieutenant Lee gave me a ironic little smile at that.

1480
02:39:22.04 --> 02:39:29.56
So they're going to go up this hill and try and take out that machine gun and as they're going

1481
02:39:29.56 --> 02:39:35.88
up the hill, he starts hearing something. Someone called from behind us. Sir, Lieutenant owned Owen.

1482
02:39:36.44 --> 02:39:41.000
It was Woody Taylor's runner. He was breathing hard from the effort. He had made to catch up with us.

1483
02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:45.56
Sir, Lieutenant Taylor wants you back down with the company. Lieutenant Lee's been hit.

1484
02:39:45.56 --> 02:39:50.44
And Lieutenant Taylor wants you. On the double, he says, damn it to hell. I might have been able

1485
02:39:50.44 --> 02:39:54.84
to roll the Chinese from the flank and take out the guns that were holding back the company.

1486
02:39:54.84 --> 02:40:03.000
I tried to get Woody on my walkie-talkie. I got more static. I waved for Morrison to rejoin us

1487
02:40:03.96 --> 02:40:09.64
and the tiny platoon slipped and slid back down the hill. As they came behind me, the men

1488
02:40:09.64 --> 02:40:15.08
cursed and complained about the second Lieutenant's making up their mind. Woody Taylor waited

1489
02:40:15.08 --> 02:40:20.04
for us at the base of the slope. He was senior to me in rankin with Lee down. He was our new company

1490
02:40:20.04 --> 02:40:26.52
commander. He said that battalion had sent up a pair of tanks and their firepower would cover

1491
02:40:26.52 --> 02:40:32.44
a frontal assault up the hill. So here we go. Finally, we get tanks and anyone that doesn't know.

1492
02:40:32.44 --> 02:40:41.000
I am a huge fan of tanks. I love tanks and all you tankers out there. Thank you for being out there

1493
02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:47.72
for these ground pounders. So he gained the old school tanks that little phone on the back of the

1494
02:40:47.72 --> 02:40:53.000
tank to talk to the guys that were inside the tank. He picks up that tank as they get prepared to do

1495
02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:57.88
this assault. And he says, put your 30s up below the ridge. Goak machine gun to 10 o'clock. Then

1496
02:40:57.88 --> 02:41:04.36
I might command hit them with the cannons. We'll jump off on that. A tiny voice came from within the tank.

1497
02:41:04.36 --> 02:41:11.24
Here you loud and clear the 30 caliber twin machine guns of both tanks. Begin their jack hammer

1498
02:41:11.24 --> 02:41:18.28
pounding. I watch red tracer stabbing up the snow covered hill toward the dug in Chinese gun

1499
02:41:18.28 --> 02:41:25.96
that we could now see dimly. Now they under that firepower they start to attack. Our line

1500
02:41:25.96 --> 02:41:31.88
moved up the hill. 25 yards above me. Two Chinese soldiers appeared from behind a large boulder.

1501
02:41:32.68 --> 02:41:38.76
One had a rifle, the other a burp gun. As I swung my car being toward them, I heard a grunt from

1502
02:41:38.76 --> 02:41:45.96
Lu Pechini. He fired his bar straight into the air and he fell forward in the snow. He did not move

1503
02:41:45.96 --> 02:41:51.32
and I knew he was dead. The best bar man we had got damn it. You've lost Lu Pechini.

1504
02:41:52.20 --> 02:41:57.24
I couldn't get my weapon on the two Chinese above me fast enough. The one with a rifle put

1505
02:41:57.24 --> 02:42:03.32
around in my left shoulder that spun me around. It's impact generated a shock like a powerful

1506
02:42:03.32 --> 02:42:09.72
jolt of electricity that went through my entire body. Damn, how could I be hit? After all this,

1507
02:42:09.72 --> 02:42:16.60
how could I get hit? I saw the burp gun trigger burst at me. The snout of his weapon flashed

1508
02:42:16.60 --> 02:42:22.20
and I could not lift my feet above my knee above the knee deep snow to get out of the path of his bullets.

1509
02:42:23.08 --> 02:42:28.92
Two slugs tore into my right arm. Two more of the electric jolt's and my car being flung

1510
02:42:28.92 --> 02:42:36.60
itself away from my grasp. I saw it rising to the air as I fell into the snow. This cannot be happening.

1511
02:42:37.64 --> 02:42:44.92
I tried to raise my head and reach to retrieve my car being get the bastards. My arms wouldn't move.

1512
02:42:45.96 --> 02:42:53.40
I could not raise myself. Joe's down, someone shouted. Bill Fox voice, get the bastards. I heard

1513
02:42:53.40 --> 02:42:59.88
myself yelling, get the bastards. I screamed in pain and overwhelming anger and my Marines rushed

1514
02:42:59.88 --> 02:43:06.44
past me and up the hill leaving Lupa, Cheyenne and me in the snow. Get the bastards. I yelled again

1515
02:43:06.44 --> 02:43:16.68
and again. It was all I can think to do. The young corpsmen who had been assigned to us for the

1516
02:43:16.68 --> 02:43:23.08
days battle cry for the days battle heard my screams. Although the enemy fire still flayed the hill,

1517
02:43:23.08 --> 02:43:28.36
he ran clumsily through the snow to reach my side. I was flat on my back and he crouch beside me.

1518
02:43:28.36 --> 02:43:32.84
Okay Lieutenant, he gasped for air with the exertion of the run laden with his

1519
02:43:33.64 --> 02:43:39.24
aid kit and cold weather gear. His breath made puffs of white steam. Then his smooth,

1520
02:43:39.24 --> 02:43:46.44
shaving face was red with 25 below zero cold. With bullets zinging all around of the new

1521
02:43:46.44 --> 02:43:51.88
corner caught away my parka. The bullet through the shoulder had nicked my lung and blood was

1522
02:43:51.88 --> 02:43:57.08
gushed and blood gushed from my mouth and down the front of my parka covering his bare hands.

1523
02:43:57.88 --> 02:44:03.72
Give me some more feet. I told the kid the pain was terrible. I can't sir. I'm sorry.

1524
02:44:03.72 --> 02:44:11.72
He shook with the cold and with his own fear. Bullet stung the air and raised little

1525
02:44:11.72 --> 02:44:18.44
fountains of snow a few feet away. Give me some goddamn morphine. I yelled spraying my blood on him.

1526
02:44:18.44 --> 02:44:23.72
Sir, the morphine is frozen. I can't give it to you. What the hell is wrong with you?

1527
02:44:23.72 --> 02:44:29.16
Here are the goddamn stuff in your mouth. Don't you boots no? Yes sir. I'm sorry sir.

1528
02:44:29.16 --> 02:44:34.68
He put the serret in his mouth and continued to cut away at my clothing. Just just trying to be still

1529
02:44:34.68 --> 02:44:40.92
sir. Even with the pain and the rage I realized that no one had told the new doc how to take

1530
02:44:40.92 --> 02:44:47.40
care of casualties in below zero weather. I greeted my teeth and tried to shut up.

1531
02:44:49.16 --> 02:44:55.000
I didn't feel the jab when he shoved the serret into my flesh but I soon felt the wave of

1532
02:44:55.000 --> 02:45:01.16
warmth come over me. The pain flowed away and the noise of the fighting above us receded.

1533
02:45:02.44 --> 02:45:07.72
You're a good lad. I told the corpsman. I felt his hands doing something. You'll be a good

1534
02:45:07.72 --> 02:45:16.76
marine. Yes sir. He sounded far away. Before I drift it off, I remembered the photos in my helmet.

1535
02:45:16.76 --> 02:45:22.04
Those are the photos of his wife and his two kids. My pictures I said. That's my wife and kids.

1536
02:45:22.04 --> 02:45:29.32
Don't let the gooks get them. I won't sir. I said the corpsman who had wrist his life to save

1537
02:45:29.32 --> 02:45:39.72
mine and whose name I never knew. Would he tailor was the only officer left with the company?

1538
02:45:40.60 --> 02:45:45.000
He led the troops to the crest of the hill fighting as a rifleman himself.

1539
02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:52.28
The Chinese were on the run and battalion ordered bacon one seven to keep after them.

1540
02:45:53.48 --> 02:45:57.32
The troops were frozen and exhausted but would he push them on.

1541
02:45:59.08 --> 02:46:04.92
Later in the day they reached their objective. With their small number they said a type

1542
02:46:04.92 --> 02:46:11.08
perimeter on the high ground overlooking the gap in the road that the engineers would bridge the next day.

1543
02:46:11.08 --> 02:46:20.44
They get that target secure. They get that hill top and now they're overlooking the gap

1544
02:46:20.44 --> 02:46:27.24
where the engineers are going to build that bridge and they set into a security perimeter.

1545
02:46:28.84 --> 02:46:34.04
Woody Taylor put the weary company on 50% watch against the enemy assault. He knew would come in the

1546
02:46:34.04 --> 02:46:41.72
dark. It was the coldest night that the man had yet endured. A reported 30 degrees below zero.

1547
02:46:43.32 --> 02:46:48.92
The wind howled at them in every direction. All through the unbearably cold hours until

1548
02:46:48.92 --> 02:46:54.20
dawn Taylor and Sergeant Richard moved from man to man to assure that no one froze to death.

1549
02:46:56.04 --> 02:47:01.40
A detail of Korean soldiers who had been attached to the army arrived to bolster the perimeter

1550
02:47:01.40 --> 02:47:08.92
but most of them filtered away during the night. Several times Marines heard the enemy moving

1551
02:47:08.92 --> 02:47:16.52
around their lines in the darkness but no attack came. Woody put out patrols early in the morning

1552
02:47:16.52 --> 02:47:24.12
before light. Within a hundred yards of a line they found frozen dozens of frozen

1553
02:47:24.12 --> 02:47:33.80
Chinese soldiers whose feet and hands were frozen to ice. The extreme cold had been on our side

1554
02:47:34.92 --> 02:47:36.92
holding back the attack.

1555
02:47:40.04 --> 02:47:45.88
And the next day Woody Taylor brought the remnants of the company down from the hills.

1556
02:47:45.88 --> 02:47:55.000
Marched them across the bridge and into the shelter of the town of Chin Hong Ni.

1557
02:47:56.52 --> 02:47:58.04
Their battle ended there.

1558
02:47:58.04 --> 02:48:11.40
Sergeant Richard took a roll call. His final count was 27 men.

1559
02:48:11.40 --> 02:48:32.76
27 men. And that is that's out of the original 200 plus men of the company.

1560
02:48:32.76 --> 02:48:41.32
And then on top of that another hundred replacements that filled their ranks in this battle.

1561
02:48:41.32 --> 02:48:50.52
So that's 300 men and only 27 remained. 27.

1562
02:48:50.52 --> 02:49:14.84
Now, few of us will ever face those kind of odds. In few of us are ever going to face those

1563
02:49:14.84 --> 02:49:29.000
hellish demands. Few of us will ever stare at hell like these men did.

1564
02:49:35.64 --> 02:49:40.92
But I want you to think about something I want you to imagine.

1565
02:49:40.92 --> 02:49:54.44
Imagine what we can accomplish. If we apply even a fraction of the will that these men displayed,

1566
02:49:54.44 --> 02:50:07.08
the iron will. A will that is stronger than their bodies, a will that is stronger than their minds.

1567
02:50:07.08 --> 02:50:23.40
Because clearly, let's face it. Their bodies, their bodies were broken and their minds in many cases were broken.

1568
02:50:23.40 --> 02:50:35.08
And they didn't want to go on, but their will, their will prevailed.

1569
02:50:35.08 --> 02:50:55.72
Will will will conquer us all. And our will is delivered through discipline.

1570
02:50:55.72 --> 02:51:06.12
And as Joe Owen stated many times in the book, sometimes the only thing that pressed them on was

1571
02:51:06.12 --> 02:51:27.08
discipline. The discipline to push yourself. And you know, we are all capable of more eye

1572
02:51:27.08 --> 02:51:37.32
and capable of more you are capable of more. You can overcome the obstacles and the challenges and the

1573
02:51:37.32 --> 02:51:47.24
enemy and you can overcome your own weaknesses. And you can overcome your own desire to quit.

1574
02:51:47.24 --> 02:52:05.96
Let's, let's, let these men be our examples of how to fight

1575
02:52:05.96 --> 02:52:17.32
and how to use your will and how to drive on and let these men be our examples of how to live.

1576
02:52:17.32 --> 02:52:44.60
And don't. Don't let these men down. And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1577
02:52:44.60 --> 02:52:55.48
Right, echo. If you want to give me a second here to recover and talk about some stuff over there,

1578
02:52:55.48 --> 02:52:58.28
I'd be much obliged.

1579
02:53:04.28 --> 02:53:06.52
Could be one of the rougher of transitions.

1580
02:53:06.52 --> 02:53:21.08
Yeah, you know, it's, you gotta remind yourself, this is a book. This happened. This happened.

1581
02:53:23.08 --> 02:53:29.80
And the fact that these guys couldn't do this and fight on if that doesn't give you

1582
02:53:29.80 --> 02:53:37.32
the inspiration that you need to step past whatever pathetic little challenges in front of you,

1583
02:53:37.32 --> 02:53:41.32
you're wrong. Don't listen to this podcast anymore. Go somewhere else.

1584
02:53:45.16 --> 02:53:54.44
Yeah, it's easy to forget it because of the kind of the contrast of your, like your problem or

1585
02:53:54.44 --> 02:53:59.88
or whatever you want to call it, you're challenged your task, your issue that you're trying to overcome.

1586
02:53:59.88 --> 02:54:05.40
And then contrast with basically the luxury that you live in and that luxury is kind of

1587
02:54:06.36 --> 02:54:15.48
put on you this kind of way of feeling on a habitual level. So, now you're faced with this task,

1588
02:54:15.48 --> 02:54:21.16
comparatively, a big one habitual comfort. Yeah, what we experience. Yes, habitual comfort. Exactly.

1589
02:54:21.16 --> 02:54:24.60
There is one thing. It's cool. I woke up early in the morning. Yeah.

1590
02:54:26.20 --> 02:54:32.12
You know what I mean? Hey, I worked out real hard and sweated a lot. Like, okay. Really? Is that all I got?

1591
02:54:32.12 --> 02:54:37.88
I need to step it up. Yeah, I need to step it up. Yeah. And then, you know, I woke up early in the morning

1592
02:54:37.88 --> 02:54:45.56
or, you know, I didn't get that much sleep. So my day is hard. Cool. Yeah, your foot's not freezing

1593
02:54:45.56 --> 02:54:50.76
off of your body. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. And what's a, what's in crowbob? This is

1594
02:54:50.76 --> 02:54:55.80
every single time you go damn, you know? I'm glad they made it out of that. Didn't make it out.

1595
02:54:55.80 --> 02:55:04.60
I mean, they're still just surrounded. Yeah. Yeah. And what's interesting is when you do remind

1596
02:55:04.60 --> 02:55:09.40
yourself of this kind of stuff. Like, like right now, if you know when feels the way I do,

1597
02:55:09.40 --> 02:55:15.48
I feel like, oh, I feel pretty much rejuvenated when I kind of flash back to my life for a second.

1598
02:55:15.48 --> 02:55:20.60
Oh, man. Oh, God. This goes. Yeah. I can go, you know, if I got to work out, I'm going to

1599
02:55:20.60 --> 02:55:25.56
crush that workout because I got all my limbs right now. They didn't freeze off all this stuff.

1600
02:55:25.56 --> 02:55:33.32
So the point there is when you are reminded of real adversity, whether you remind yourself

1601
02:55:33.32 --> 02:55:39.56
or the book or something you see or hear about, um, like, it gives you that, like that added

1602
02:55:39.56 --> 02:55:47.16
will to to overcome. Yeah. Maybe you, you actually can take some of their will. You can learn it.

1603
02:55:47.16 --> 02:55:51.56
Yeah. You can learn it. You can say, oh, you know what, oh, I'm cold right now. You're not cold.

1604
02:55:51.56 --> 02:55:57.000
Yeah. You're, you're, you're, you are not cold. You're tired right now. No, you are not tired.

1605
02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:00.20
You're not. You're afraid right now. No. You are not afraid.

1606
02:56:01.16 --> 02:56:07.96
Learn. Yeah. Learn. You just increase your will through knowledge. It's a real thing.

1607
02:56:07.96 --> 02:56:13.08
Yeah. It's true. And when you do with my point being when you do remind yourself of this kind of

1608
02:56:13.08 --> 02:56:20.92
stuff, man, it helps. It'll help you do whatever it is or over come the fact. Yeah, because you realize

1609
02:56:20.92 --> 02:56:27.96
that that human beings are capable of more. Wait, what you, then what you know, more than I know.

1610
02:56:27.96 --> 02:56:32.68
I'm capable of more than what I've done. I'm going to do more. You know, I'm going to get after

1611
02:56:32.68 --> 02:56:37.72
it. Hargur. That's what I take away from this, these kind of books. Obviously, besides there's

1612
02:56:37.72 --> 02:56:43.000
incredible tactical lessons in there. There's incredible leadership. There's incredible, but the, the

1613
02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:49.96
testament of human will is incredible is unbelievable. Unbelievable testament to human will.

1614
02:56:49.96 --> 02:56:57.40
Yeah. So now I feel like, or it seems like, you know, that when we're faced or when I'm faced with,

1615
02:56:57.40 --> 02:57:03.32
like, oh, this is too hard or dang, I got all this ahead of me. I got to do all, really all

1616
02:57:03.32 --> 02:57:11.80
that is. Now, looking at it, it seems like all it is is a deviation from my habitual comfort.

1617
02:57:11.80 --> 02:57:15.40
Yeah. That's all that is. And I'll tell you what was awesome the way that he reinforced

1618
02:57:15.40 --> 02:57:18.92
it reinforced several times because people talked about fear. I've talked about fear on this podcast

1619
02:57:18.92 --> 02:57:22.60
before, but you know, I kind of say, hey, take action if you're afraid, you got to step into it.

1620
02:57:22.60 --> 02:57:26.76
He said that over and over again. He actually had a methodology. Okay, if I'm afraid, I'm going to

1621
02:57:26.76 --> 02:57:30.36
I'm going to, I'm going to stand up. I'm going to get a rectum. I'm going to find out what's

1622
02:57:30.36 --> 02:57:35.32
going on and I'm going to get, I'm going to find out, I'm going to assess the situation before my

1623
02:57:36.04 --> 02:57:40.92
boss calls me. That's my timeline that I'm working on. Yeah. And that's the same to take action.

1624
02:57:42.52 --> 02:57:49.56
So many, so many great lessons learned in there. Yeah. Well, yeah, I feel like, yeah, we can transition

1625
02:57:49.56 --> 02:57:54.76
over to ways to support. Well, yeah, if you want people with people do want to support the podcast

1626
02:57:54.76 --> 02:58:00.68
out there, I guess you could, if you're in the mood, how to do that? Oh, yeah. So the first way and this is

1627
02:58:00.68 --> 02:58:07.80
kind of a two-way street, you know, okay, on its supplements, right? Supplements, all kinds of cool

1628
02:58:07.80 --> 02:58:15.24
stuff. In fact, my friend from Kuwait, Cameron, he hit me up and was like, hey, what's on it has this,

1629
02:58:15.24 --> 02:58:21.64
it's a new pre-workout, you know, but it's non-stimulate, usually pre-workout. It's like, crush

1630
02:58:21.64 --> 02:58:26.04
a popo-punch, a fedger, and they feed it to you. They don't actually do that, but it seems like they do.

1631
02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:30.84
I'm not saying that's all the bad thing, but it's not like healthy, you know? So anyway, this one is like

1632
02:58:30.84 --> 02:58:36.20
a healthy one is like non-stimulate and it's like, oh, I got it. I just got it. I'm going to try it yet.

1633
02:58:36.20 --> 02:58:42.36
I'm going to get that out. I'm going to get that out. Yeah. But if you're into like, you know,

1634
02:58:42.36 --> 02:58:46.04
sometimes you go on the website and you get like caught up reading all the cool stuff and all the

02:58:46.04 --> 02:58:49.64

1636
02:58:49.64 --> 02:58:55.72
You actually mentioned that a lot. How you go to the on it website. You know, I maybe I just don't

1637
02:58:55.72 --> 02:59:00.20
do as thorough research as you when it comes to checking out where my acrylic oil comes from,

1638
02:59:00.20 --> 02:59:05.16
but I know what I'm looking for and I go do it. But if you're more like echo and you want to spend

1639
02:59:05.16 --> 02:59:10.44
time on the website reading and researching, it's good place to do is on it.com for a slash

03:00:23.56 --> 03:00:29.88

1653
03:00:29.88 --> 03:00:34.52
easy. Yeah. Oh, I want to eat something healthy and that tastes good. And I'm kind of hungry. And I want to get

1654
03:00:34.52 --> 03:00:38.76

03:00:38.76 --> 03:00:44.04
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Guaranteed. But yeah, this is cool stuff. I got this peanut butter. It's

1656
03:00:44.04 --> 03:00:50.68
not peanut butter's cashew almond and I don't know something else. It's really good. I've got

1657
03:00:50.68 --> 03:00:56.84
it's real corn may too. MCT oil. It's all up in there. Anyway, good stuff. I don't know. I do have an

1658
03:00:56.84 --> 03:01:03.80
MCT oil too by the way. Yeah. I take the coconut MCT oil from on it and I mix it with heavy whipping

1659
03:01:03.80 --> 03:01:08.52
cream. I don't know. I don't do that until it's whipped cream. Right. I just poured in a little bit

1660
03:01:08.52 --> 03:01:14.92
in there. I stirred up and I drink heavy whipping cream, which is just all fat, which is awesome with

1661
03:01:14.92 --> 03:01:21.24
MCT, which is more fat than I drink all that. Yeah. And it's good fat. Yeah, it's good fat. But it also

1662
03:01:21.24 --> 03:01:27.88
it's very, very fulfilling. Very, very nice. And I'm talking, I almost, it's a little bit

1663
03:01:27.88 --> 03:01:32.28
big when I have little glasses that I mix it in. They're bigger than a shot glass, but they're

1664
03:01:32.28 --> 03:01:37.72
smaller than a cocktail glass. Right. It's called the Rocks Glass. Mm, perhaps. In the bar

1665
03:01:37.72 --> 03:01:43.24
in the shoe. It's okay. You know more about that stuff. Yeah. It's bigger than yeah. Yeah. MCT,

1666
03:01:43.24 --> 03:01:48.84
I mean, not to go into all the fats and good fats for us, but it's more fulfilling fat has nine

1667
03:01:48.84 --> 03:01:54.76
calories per gram. Yeah. Carbide rates and protein. Have four, four. Yeah. Alcohol. 7.

1668
03:01:56.36 --> 03:02:01.08
That was a good idea. I was not aware of that. Yeah. It's all good. Alcohol is not. I don't think

1669
03:02:01.08 --> 03:02:06.04
they saw alcohol on it. So if you're all good there. But that's a good way. I feel like I'm repeating

03:02:42.52 --> 03:02:48.36

hey, where are your favorite books that you've read? Can you send us a list of those?

1679
03:02:53.64 --> 03:02:59.80
And I say, yeah, go to www.jaccopodcast.com. All the books that we've talked about on the podcast,

1680
03:02:59.80 --> 03:03:06.04
the book that I read today, go and buy it, go and buy it, holder than hell. A marine rifle company

1681
03:03:06.04 --> 03:03:13.40
at Choes and Reservoir by Joseph R. Owen. Buy it, read it. I could have just read the entire book

1682
03:03:13.40 --> 03:03:18.36
on air. Obviously, I'm not going to do that, but it would take a long time. It would take a

1683
03:03:18.36 --> 03:03:24.68
long time, but there's so much stuff that I absolutely had to skip and say, you know, I was

1684
03:03:24.68 --> 03:03:30.76
struggling with myself going, I used up most of a highlighter and a half highlighting this book.

1685
03:03:31.48 --> 03:03:37.64
So, but order this book, you'll have it on the website. Yeah, it's the whole page. All of

1686
03:03:37.64 --> 03:03:42.20
them are on air. Yeah, on the paper, you go on top menu, you know, books from the podcast,

1687
03:03:42.20 --> 03:03:46.84
this thing is called click on it. There's links directly to Amazon. Yeah, yeah, boom, there's another

1688
03:03:46.84 --> 03:03:50.68
way to support, but it's all Amazon. You click through, if you're just doing regular shopping,

1689
03:03:50.68 --> 03:03:54.44
there's a banner on the right side. You click through there, do you shopping? And it supports

1690
03:03:54.44 --> 03:04:03.16
the podcast. Two birds, one stone. You know, I also you can subscribe to the podcast on iTunes.

1691
03:04:04.04 --> 03:04:12.92
We, Jockel, probably, well, no, you already mentioned this. Oh, we got on the top podcast of 2016 list.

1692
03:04:13.72 --> 03:04:18.52
I tuned. I tuned. It's big deal. Anyway, subscribe to there. You too, uh, not YouTube, but I

1693
03:04:18.52 --> 03:04:26.12
tuned. We were on the top podcast of 2016 list from iTunes. Is your iTunes? Correct. Yeah, that just

1694
03:04:26.12 --> 03:04:32.68
popped in my head because when you subscribe, you subscribe on iTunes. Leave a review if you're in the

1695
03:04:32.68 --> 03:04:40.20
mood. Actually, leave a review and make sure it's awesome. Not awesome in terms of good, but just

1696
03:04:40.20 --> 03:04:47.40
make sure that it's fun for me to read. Yeah, yeah, that'll involve more the will to read or if you're

1697
03:04:47.40 --> 03:04:54.44
not fun to read some good points that you like or don't like. And yeah, I like reading those reviews.

1698
03:04:54.44 --> 03:05:00.04
I do, I've read everything I'll review. So I'm reading them. It's good. And I'm busy to check.

1699
03:05:00.68 --> 03:05:04.92
Yeah, yeah, make sure we're delivering. Yeah, you got to do it very good.

1704
03:05:32.76 --> 03:05:40.44
Jocomic is a store. It's called jocostor.com. So if every week we all wear clothes, t-shirts, right? Why not

1705
03:05:40.44 --> 03:05:48.60
make it a jocot t-shirt? That's kind of the thing, you know? It's a thing. You know, Brad, how's this so

1706
03:05:48.60 --> 03:05:55.40
Chris? I don't know if I showed you this. So Chris Ruiz are a friend. Um, fellow back. He's that. I want to say

1707
03:05:55.40 --> 03:05:59.88
I don't even know the whole story. I was trying to call him. He was like, Charlie, but there's no,

1708
03:05:59.88 --> 03:06:07.08
I totally know this story. Yeah. So yeah, he's one of the, one of the cadets. Yeah, I could edit at

1709
03:06:07.08 --> 03:06:14.52
West Point. Yeah. So he's, I don't know how, do you know how he's all? How we saw him or whatever,

1710
03:06:14.52 --> 03:06:19.24
but a cadet at West Point and I don't have, I don't have his name right now. In uniform. Yeah,

1711
03:06:19.24 --> 03:06:22.84
yeah, he's in uniform, but the uniform that they were, it's cold up there. So where these basically

1712
03:06:22.84 --> 03:06:30.12
it's like a giant cape. And underneath the cape, he had a jocopock ashtirt on. He had actually,

1713
03:06:30.12 --> 03:06:35.24
they actually had the straight-up jockel face on that thing. And it was, he posted an awesome picture

1714
03:06:35.24 --> 03:06:42.76
on social media of him, of him pulling up his cape and he had that, that, that t-shirt on. Yeah.

1715
03:06:42.76 --> 03:06:47.64
Jockel's face. Maybe that was the secret weapon that led the army to the first victory,

1716
03:06:47.64 --> 03:06:53.72
in 14 years over Navy and football. Tom Neill. Tom Neill, yes. He's the, he was the cadet.

1717
03:06:53.72 --> 03:06:58.76
Doing it. Yeah. He was the, in the wild. Really in the wild, double in the wild. Yeah. Well,

1718
03:06:58.76 --> 03:07:02.04
that's he gave me all in the wild. That's, I mean, I don't know what the regulations are,

1719
03:07:02.04 --> 03:07:07.40
but I'm fairly certain that the, the, the t-shirt, the jocopock has t-shirt is not part of our

1720
03:07:07.40 --> 03:07:11.96
army regulations unless it is now. Who know, I'm just saying there were no perhaps. But yeah,

1721
03:07:11.96 --> 03:07:19.40
he's been, he's been actually in touch before he went to West Point. He was, when he was getting ready

1722
03:07:19.40 --> 03:07:24.20
to go, he was like reaching out and he was getting after it. Yeah. Go crush it.

1723
03:07:24.20 --> 03:07:28.68
Don't spoil it. So good. Yeah. Into some nogie, jujutsu. Yeah. True. True. True.

1724
03:07:29.24 --> 03:07:32.76
Anyway, yeah. So jockels stored calm. That's where you can get like cool shirts,

1725
03:07:33.32 --> 03:07:37.08
disciplining cool freedom, you know, all these things, you know, some women stuff on there,

1726
03:07:37.08 --> 03:07:43.56
some hoodies on there, some rash guards on there for, for, yeah, some activity. You know what I'm talking about?

1727
03:07:43.56 --> 03:07:50.04
And some patches on there, the re-regulation one with the, you know, the, I want the, the velcro that's

1728
03:07:50.04 --> 03:07:54.92
some, that's on there, some other stuff. So yeah, go on there, look at it. You don't have to buy nothing.

1729
03:07:54.92 --> 03:07:59.96
Just look at it. If you like something, go ahead. Get it. Good way to support and boom, you got to

1730
03:07:59.96 --> 03:08:09.000
sure. Um, also, okay. So here's the, here's the thing, let's start a while ago. Okay. So I'll tell

1731
03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:17.40
this story. I'll keep it true. But so I was like, I don't have echo went rogue again. That's it. Yeah.

1732
03:08:17.40 --> 03:08:22.68
So, and it started with kind of nothing. So, you know, okay, we're talking about luxury and like,

1733
03:08:22.68 --> 03:08:28.52
okay, I, I only got six hours sleep. I'm usually used to eight and a half or something like that,

1734
03:08:28.52 --> 03:08:33.24
right. So, but I know I can do a workout. And I know you don't get that much sleep or if you're

1735
03:08:33.24 --> 03:08:36.92
tired and not tired of what you still push through the workout. So, but I'm thinking, yeah, yeah,

1736
03:08:36.92 --> 03:08:41.96
you're hard, your money, whatever, but you got it. There has to be times where you got to

1737
03:08:41.96 --> 03:08:49.96
basically talk yourself into it. Basically. So I'm like, all right, like, what do you say? You

1738
03:08:49.96 --> 03:08:55.64
got it, you know, be honest, like, what do you say? You know, to yourself. And I figured it, it would

1739
03:08:55.64 --> 03:09:00.92
have, you know, like a lot of stuff that you cannot, we say, like, you know, we have this luxury and

1740
03:09:00.92 --> 03:09:08.68
all this stuff. I'm like, all right, but let me, so I asked you and what you told me, I was like, okay,

1741
03:09:08.68 --> 03:09:15.24
that, oh, that was good. So, it was legit right there. So, and it worked. It totally worked.

1742
03:09:16.36 --> 03:09:21.48
So, what I did, you know, one thing like to another kind of in my head. So, I was like, all right,

1743
03:09:21.48 --> 03:09:25.48
you know, what we're gonna do, we're gonna record that. You're gonna say that, I'm gonna record it.

1744
03:09:25.48 --> 03:09:30.92
And on top of that, not just the work, you know, and usually, like, with food and stuff, like,

1745
03:09:30.92 --> 03:09:35.72
donuts and I joke around that, I eat, like, whole things of Oreos, because I kind of, that's just a joke.

1746
03:09:35.72 --> 03:09:41.08
Like, sometimes I do, but you do. Yeah, but I have will-pile. Like, that's not a problem with, but

1747
03:09:42.12 --> 03:09:49.16
some people don't, some like, yeah, that workout thing that you just said could apply to, like,

1748
03:09:49.16 --> 03:09:51.96
all these other things. We're gonna record that, too.

1749
03:09:51.96 --> 03:09:56.68
Then you start thinking, you know, a lot of people have been saying, hey, what about, like,

1750
03:09:56.68 --> 03:10:01.72
a ringtone, you should have ringtones, you know, for my alarm and all this stuff. So, like, all right,

1751
03:10:01.72 --> 03:10:07.24
well, basically, one thing led to another, we recorded them, and I put them on iTunes.

1752
03:10:08.44 --> 03:10:14.04
Called it psychological warfare. It's good move, I think, on my part.

1753
03:10:14.04 --> 03:10:19.16
It's on iTunes. Yes, on iTunes. It's like, yeah, so we're charging, and here's the night,

1754
03:10:19.16 --> 03:10:24.36
so this kind of ties it back to how you can support the podcast. Look, so we hit about eight to

1755
03:10:24.36 --> 03:10:29.40
ten birds with one stone with this. It's nine nine cents for a track, or you can buy, like,

1756
03:10:29.40 --> 03:10:33.80
the whole thing, there's, like, 13, 14 tracks on there for nine bucks. I think that's kind of standard,

1757
03:10:33.80 --> 03:10:40.20
but so that's so much, I put it, or I listed it as, and you just download it, you put it as your ringtone.

1758
03:10:40.20 --> 03:10:44.92
There's one for a waking up. Actually, there's two for a waking up, right? So, you can put three for waking up.

1759
03:10:44.92 --> 03:10:50.12
Maybe, yeah, but there's a few. Because in my mind, I pictured people, like, oh, you want to wake up?

1760
03:10:50.12 --> 03:10:55.56
Cool, we can come on that. I go through that every day waking up. Well, so yeah, we'll do that.

1761
03:10:55.56 --> 03:11:00.04
It's sort of like a song that you could buy, it's like a song that you could buy on iTunes.

1762
03:11:00.04 --> 03:11:05.56
Yeah, same process. Or an album. Yeah, same process. You just, yeah, you just download. You can buy one

1763
03:11:05.56 --> 03:11:09.56
track two tracks, or the whole thing, or what, you know, it's 99 cents. So it's not like,

1764
03:11:10.28 --> 03:11:14.68
you're supporting the podcast. Yeah, exactly right. Here's here's a little tip. I was thinking about

1765
03:11:14.68 --> 03:11:20.04
though. So you know, you're wake up. There's like, oh, a few wake up ones, right? I mentioned that.

1766
03:11:21.24 --> 03:11:27.72
If you put that as your alarm, clear it with your wife or whoever you're sleeping with. I'll tell you

1767
03:11:27.72 --> 03:11:32.92
right now if that thing, but if she don't know about it, and that comes on, it'll freak her out then.

1768
03:11:32.92 --> 03:11:40.04
So, do that. That's a little pro tip right there if he's in it. But I will, I will say it's 100%

1769
03:11:40.04 --> 03:11:44.84
guaranteed. If you felt like, how I felt with workouts, like, I'm really not in the mood to go

1770
03:11:44.84 --> 03:11:51.56
do a workout. And you listen to the workout one, I will say with 100% certainty, you will not skip the

1771
03:11:51.56 --> 03:11:59.88
work. I'll say that right now. That's legit. Anyway, psychological warfare. Who's the artist?

1772
03:11:59.88 --> 03:12:04.92
I think it's just a willink. Okay. I think, because that's how they list them by artist, right?

1773
03:12:04.92 --> 03:12:09.72
Yeah, I think so. That I just, that I just become an artist with there. That's scary. Let's call it something

1774
03:12:09.72 --> 03:12:14.12
else. You kind of got to do something else. You kind of have to find this and push into it though.

1775
03:12:14.12 --> 03:12:21.32
So, you know, artist author, podcaster, technically. Is that the thing? You have to,

1776
03:12:21.32 --> 03:12:24.92
you know what, give your wife the heads up if you're a fighter. These guys are flaked in the

1777
03:12:24.92 --> 03:12:30.12
worn career, I'm over here being an artist. What happened? But it's all you know wrong. Not going to

1778
03:12:30.12 --> 03:12:36.52
happen. Not, it's all for because though, I'm telling you because if anyone's like, I am which

1779
03:12:36.52 --> 03:12:41.88
I'm straight up. It's more than assumption. I'm, I am of the belief that some people are like me

1780
03:12:41.88 --> 03:12:47.000
in that way where you just don't feel like it. I know we just read this and now we all feel like

1781
03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:49.88
it. I understand that. But you don't have that feeling every single day.

1782
03:12:51.16 --> 03:12:55.32
Then tell me right now, this helps. This helps to get after it. Help me, for sure.

1783
03:12:56.04 --> 03:13:03.16
You know, psychological warfare. You know, all right, also, hey, on iTunes or sorry,

1784
03:13:03.16 --> 03:13:10.12
not on iTunes, but on Amazon, you can get some white tea. It's like I said, we're working through

1785
03:13:10.12 --> 03:13:15.96
the supply chain issues. But it's been popping up every couple days. They refill. You can order it.

1786
03:13:15.96 --> 03:13:22.52
It tastes good and it makes you feel good and it will increase your deadlift capabilities

1787
03:13:23.96 --> 03:13:30.44
to a minimum of 7,000 pounds. Many are getting up to 8,000 pounds. From drinking chocolate,

1788
03:13:30.44 --> 03:13:37.56
you can get up and get after it mug by the way, too. So those are bigger than normal. I'll say that.

1789
03:13:37.56 --> 03:13:42.36
They're bigger than a normal mug. A normal mug is not as big as it get after it mug.

1790
03:13:42.36 --> 03:13:49.96
So it's like with every sip, you're doing bicep curls. You're getting, actually, that's not my joke.

1791
03:13:49.96 --> 03:13:56.60
I could still have from Twitter. So that's that. Also, when Amazon, you can pick up colder than hell.

1792
03:13:56.60 --> 03:14:02.12
The book I read today, do it. Put it in your collection of badass books. You can pick up

1793
03:14:02.12 --> 03:14:07.56
another book that's called Extreme Ownership. That's written by me and my brother, Dave Babin.

1794
03:14:08.68 --> 03:14:13.88
It is also a book that's about combat, but it's also more of a book about leadership.

1795
03:14:14.76 --> 03:14:18.76
And if you want to give some, speaking of the holiday season,

1796
03:14:20.04 --> 03:14:24.20
if you want to give someone a gift, that's going to, you know, some gifts that you get,

1797
03:14:24.20 --> 03:14:30.28
they go in the drawer that doesn't get opened anymore. Right? And then it takes you a couple

1798
03:14:30.28 --> 03:14:35.72
years and you finally throw it away. Don't give that gift. Give the gift that someone's going to say,

1799
03:14:37.56 --> 03:14:42.20
give me that book. It's legit. I read it. Oh, I implemented this. Hey, what did you think about the

1800
03:14:42.20 --> 03:14:48.36
gift? Give my gift that's going to have long-term value, long-term value. Give them a little book called

1801
03:14:48.36 --> 03:14:55.16
Extreme Ownership. You can know Amazon.com. Hey, speaking of extreme ownership. Also, we got the

1802
03:14:55.16 --> 03:15:02.44
master number two, 002 May 4th and 5th at the Marriott Markey in New York City. Now, the last one

1803
03:15:02.44 --> 03:15:09.48
that we had, we had people from 42 different states. We had people from five foreign countries.

1804
03:15:09.48 --> 03:15:16.84
And we had leaders at every level of the chain of command in every size business that you could

1805
03:15:16.84 --> 03:15:23.88
imagine. So it was a super diverse group of people that are all together with, they had one similarity

1806
03:15:23.88 --> 03:15:29.000
and that is they want to get better and crush it in leadership in their business and in their life.

1807
03:15:30.28 --> 03:15:36.68
So that's what we do with the master, life and I who are there. Obviously, when I say we're there,

1808
03:15:38.04 --> 03:15:41.24
I don't mean we're there, meaning we're in the same building, but we're hiding somewhere.

1809
03:15:41.24 --> 03:15:47.24
No, no, we're there. We are actually with you. We are sitting down with you. We are talking. We are

1810
03:15:47.80 --> 03:15:51.56
we're not hiding behind the curtain. We don't even have a backstage. They said, well,

1811
03:15:51.56 --> 03:15:57.08
where do you want your backstage? We don't need one. We're not going backstage. People want to come

1812
03:15:57.08 --> 03:16:02.76
and talk and learn. We want to learn from them. So come and get it. I've said this every time.

1813
03:16:02.76 --> 03:16:06.76
This is going to sell out. It's going to sell out and then you won't be able to go. And also,

1814
03:16:06.76 --> 03:16:14.04
the prices are going up. So as you get closer to the event, the prices go up. The reason we do that

1815
03:16:14.04 --> 03:16:19.48
is so we incentivize you to buy the tickets now so that we can plan better. We like to be

1816
03:16:19.48 --> 03:16:29.08
planned, we plan and we prepare things. If all of you sign up, April 22nd, we got some logistics

1817
03:16:29.08 --> 03:16:32.76
problems. I don't want to be in the same boat. I'm in with Jockel White Tea, where I've failed

1818
03:16:32.76 --> 03:16:39.24
logistically. And it takes me a while to get it back on track. So sign up early, save yourself some

1819
03:16:39.24 --> 03:16:43.08
money and let us be better prepared for that. If you got questions, you can email,

1820
03:16:43.08 --> 03:16:52.04
muster at echelonfront.com or you can check out the website www.extremownership.com.

1821
03:16:54.04 --> 03:17:00.28
We will see you there and you will see me. You'll see, Lave, you'll see Echo Charles.

1822
03:17:00.28 --> 03:17:07.80
And you'll see everybody else. We'll all be there getting after it. While you're waiting

1823
03:17:08.60 --> 03:17:14.60
to hang out with us at the muster, if you want to hang out with us virtually,

1824
03:17:14.60 --> 03:17:23.24
well Echo and I are both kind of cruising the interwebs. Twitter, yep, where they're

1825
03:17:23.24 --> 03:17:32.12
Instagram, where they're and you even gonna see us. You're even gonna see us on that Facebook

1826
03:17:32.12 --> 03:17:46.20
you boy. Echo is at echelonchiles and I am at Jockel Willink. And finally, we appreciate

1827
03:17:46.20 --> 03:17:54.68
you listening and supporting the podcast and of course spread in the word. But don't just listen.

1828
03:17:56.52 --> 03:18:08.60
Do. Execute. Take a look at your life and see where you can apply the kind of human

1829
03:18:08.60 --> 03:18:18.36
will we heard about tonight. The kind of human will that overcomes challenges and obstacles,

1830
03:18:18.36 --> 03:18:25.96
whether you're fighting a war or you're fighting a fire or you're fighting crime or you're building

1831
03:18:25.96 --> 03:18:35.64
a bridge or you're building a piece of software or whether you're doing HVAC work or retail work

1832
03:18:35.64 --> 03:18:45.56
or whether you're healing kids or you're teaching kids. No matter what you are doing,

1833
03:18:47.08 --> 03:18:55.000
what can you do to do it better? What can you do to make you better?

1834
03:18:55.000 --> 03:19:08.12
Ask yourself that question. Apply that will and get after it.

1835
03:19:12.04 --> 03:19:17.000
So until next time, this is Echo and Jockel.

1836
03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:25.64
Out.
