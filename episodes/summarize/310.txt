right is you got to know what the minimum requirements are once you define your goal is natural tendency and 99.9% of us get this right is you ask yourself what are the requirements to get there you want to be a doctor you know you got to go to medical pre-med medical school and pass the boards lawyer pre-law law passed the bar astronaut you know you got to go to the STEM field get graduate degree four or five years experience and then start applying so that's the first one everyone gets that one you know it's it's no the requirement second one is emulate successful people that you want to aspire to be like in other words you know ask yourself what do they have that I don't have you know if you want to be a CEO study a CEO and study find out how they got there you want to be an astronaut study an astronaut I mean that's what I did after my six our failure remember I'd compare myself I found out they were all pilots so what did I do I invested in myself I became a pilot then I found out they were all school but certified what did I do I invested in myself and became school certified the third stage of that of that strategy is is you got to create a differentiator in other words differentiate yourself from differentiate yourself from the competition you know at that the time you know it was from 4,000 and went up to 12,000 that I had a differentiate myself because you don't know if that faulty fuel valve would have acted up during that launch right and and once we shut things off and then started back up we got that indication and we replaced it so you know it could have been that the weather saved us could have been just let me know luckily on Friday we once again found ourselves sitting inside discovery ready for takeoff with only two and a half hours to go I knew it was only a matter time before a button was pushed and we would be well on our way into space the NASA team in Houston was confident that the third time wasn't needed charm suddenly in the blink of an eye the countdown clock was set in a motion after having reached the nine minute hold we could hear the countdown nine minutes five seconds four three two we closed our helmet advisers as we heard the three main engines light up shortly thereafter we felt the gentle vibrations of the engines about two seconds later as the countdown reached zero the noise level increased in a magnitude and the vibrations grew more violent the two solid motors attached to the side of the external tanks it had ignited just as I thought the whole shuttle was going to shake apart or fall to one side I felt a lot of pressure on my back I heard zero takeoff through the corner my eye could see the tower staying behind as we lifted off we were on our way immediately the muscle memory of our training simulations took over I quickly focused on my job as mission specialist too which was to execute the role of a flight engineer I began reading off the pre-determined milestones to our commander in pilot while monitoring the screens engages in the front and above me doing sure none of them would deviate from their expected readings the most dynamic parts of our mission were blast off in the subsequent eight and a half minute flight into space during the latter we went from resting on the launch pad to orbiting our planet at more than 17,000 500 miles an hour at an altitude of some 280 miles two and a half minutes into our launch the two solid rocket boosters separated and fell to the ocean about 200 miles northeast of the Kennedy space center after the initial two and a half minutes the next six minutes became quieter and the ride became a lot smoother when we reached eight minutes and 30 seconds into the flight we had reached the main engine cut off this basically meant that we had reached our top speed of 11,000 or 17,500 miles an hour and it turned off our main engines the next step was for us to monitor the separation of the external tank which was feeding our three main engines the external tank typically ends up so high that it does not survive reentry into the atmosphere and thus disintegrates into pieces before falling armlessly back into the ocean the shuttle usually possesses enough energy to continue upward and when appropriate begins orbiting the planet soon after this happened to us we approached we reached a microgravity environment and began floating in space high above the earth our mission was well on its way we did that thing starts to rumble well how's that feel that the exhaust that go you know I'll be honest with you jacos is that you know if there was any piece of fear during this whole process of being an astronaut I would have to say it's probably the first three seconds of when you reach zero and you feel the three engines light up yes I'm a classmate good friend of mine that's awesome um our first big training assignment involved traveling to the Naval Air Station in Pensacola Florida once there we spent six weeks going to ground school being taught water survival techniques learning how to co-pilot the T-34 airplanes ground school involved not only learning basic principles of flight but also putting those principles to work in high fidelity flight simulators probably the most interesting activity during the six-week training program was the one where we went on submersible device that simulated the fuselage of a helicopter this device is it actually known as the helodunker so you when you get picked up when you get picked up for the program you're still not an astronaut you have to make it through how long is that training program two years it's astronaut candidate program it's two years you go through a lot of academics you go through the learning the systems of the space shuttle 18 you know a typical airline has about eight or nine subsystems an airline plane the space shuttle has 18 and you have to learn each one of them you have written tests on each one of them then you got single system trainers so you master each one of them then you got multi system trainers where they start cross-pollinating the systems and how one system affects the other and then you've got the high fidelity motion base simulator where then it pick up crew a four of you are in the cockpit and they draw everything about the kitchen sink at you and you've got us you know it's either an asset run or is an orbit operations or it's a landing and but they all fail things for you and you got to figure it out and you got to pass all that every Friday there's a test it's like being in finals week for two continuous years I mean pre-intense I was got you covered cool stuff to hang on your wall which is all you need to say comes from Dakota Meyer and it's cool stuff to hang on your wire wall check up flipside canvas dot com order something for yourself made in America by the way also got some books final spin get I can't say too much about it but let's let's face it if you haven't read final spin you want to you probably need to go get that go get that there you go there's your advice leaders of strategy and tactics field manual the code the evaluation the protocols discipline equals freedom field manual way the warrior kid one two three and four that's what I'm trying to do kids are out there they need those books they need to be on the path they need to get steered straight unlike Carlos now bear to insert you that you heard about on this podcast today get the kids on the path way the warrior kid one two three four there's Christmas there's a life changing Christmas is that a bold statement no it's not actually life changing Christmas get way of the warrior kid one two three and four for all the kids that you know making investment every kid that you know get them all four of those books change their life get them on the path if you got little kids get them liking the dragons best little kids books ever extreme ownership that caught me of leadership that are real with my brother Dave Babin don't forget about about face by Colonel David Hackworth I wrote the forward on the new addition we have a leadership consultancy it's called echelon front we solve problems through leadership no matter what's going on leadership is the solution leadership is the solution go to echelon front dot com for details there can also come to one of our live events we have the master we have field training exercise we have eF battlefield we have the next master is in Dallas Texas March 24th and 25th if you want to come and get some of that we also have an online training program called extreme ownership academy leadership is not something you just learn and you're good and so I had the opportunity to appreciate what um with the dedication of everybody because you know when I went to work there you know I took a 10% pay cut from Lawrence Lvmour lab because I made too much money at the lab so you know that that was one part of my hesitation of accepting the job that my wife convinced me and said they don't worry about it what will make it happen and so so so from that perspective you know that's the the point I'm getting at is that the people that work there can make more money elsewhere but they love their job and they're doing everything possible and it only took me you know when I when I was part of the whole process of the accident investigation and I saw the dedication of everybody and in in previous to that when we were preparing for launches I saw the dedication of people during their normal activities and so a lot of people always told me when I got selected in to down the floor they said you crazy I said the base shuttle just disintegrated last year of course um so I am skipping to this part here we arrived at the launch pad and entered the elevator to go up the hundred ninety two foot level where we had access to the shuttles hatch a walkway allowed us to approach the white room that was next to the hatch it was in this white room where we put on the last of our gear before entering the shuttle and getting strapped in by the close-out crew one by one we were called in to take our seats fast forward members of the close-out crew exited the shuttle the hatch was shut and closed it was then that the close-out crew performed a cabin leak check and then disassembled the white room to clear the launch pad during the last hour before launch I sat strapped to my seat on the flight deck a million different thoughts rushed through my mind fast forward a little bit suddenly I heard the countdown reach the nine minute hold that is when the final systems checked are conducted by the launch control center it was almost time make your final adjustments and prepare for takeoff we heard cabin revision complete manuals ready seconds before launch the bottom of the launch pad was sprayed with water and it effort to cushion the noise and vibration as a result of the power dissipated by both the three main the three shuttle main engines and the two solid rocket boosters everything was going to plan until P. Nicolenko for launch director informed us that the weather conditions were unfavorable 50 minutes later our mission was aboard a due to local funder storms in the Florida skies so close so close out a few hours later a new date and time was announced for the discovery launch Wednesday August 26th 2009 this was a 48 hour slip the mission management team who had set the new launch date obviously did not share or optimism about the weather improving within 24 hours as we woke up on Wednesday we found out that it was not going to happen then either we discovered a defective fuel control valve which is being replaced at the moment we pushed back the launch date again for 1159 on Friday August 28th 2009 NASA informed us that reminds me of you know when you're on an airplane at the on the tarmac and first it gets delayed and then it gets delayed again and all of a sudden they go hey we found a maintenance problem next thing you know if like it's canceled we're deborting tera luna sellers tera luna sellers dot com tera luna engineering was an engineering engineering up to your luna engineering dot com if you want to get some help getting into space or you want to drink some wine Jose's got you covered which is awesome and for all those men women out there right now in the army navy air force marines thank you for keeping us safe here on earth and also thanks to our police law enforcement firefighters paramedics and EMT's dispatchers correction officers board of patrol secret service and all first responders thanks for keeping us safe here at home and to everyone else out there remember remember Jose Hernandez his family give us an incredible example of what hard work and persistence 12 years of persistence by the way persistence can do for us and he gave us a simple plan to fall identify or go identify where you are in relation that goal map out a way to get there educate yourself thoroughly around that goal put in the work people don't want to hear about that step put in the work working at a cannery from 10 o'clock at night till 6 o'clock in the morning then go on a class at nine in the morning getting two and a half hours of sleep when you get to home from school going back to the cannery that's put in work that's put in work and finally never give up persistence persistence persistence persistence persistence 12 rejection letters I guess it was 11 rejection letters got it on the 12th 11 rejection letters 11 years of rejection and what am I doing what can I do how can I get better where can I improve and on top of all that listen it's the journey it's the process it's the track it's the voyage that are the most important part and if if you go on that path even if you don't make it to the end of the path if you go on that path look at how much further you are along in life look about how much better you have improved as a human being so relish the struggle and even relish when you come up short which you will that's part of it keep reaching keeps scratching and no matter what but keep getting after it and until next time this is Carrie and Jaco out. yes you got told it was a go fast forward a little bit here we go as the launch data approached it became harder to sleep I tossed and turned for hours until I was finally able to sleep soundly part of the reason I was not a little sleep was because I kept thinking about what could possibly go wrong during the mission what if something fails what will happen to my family how will my wife kids in parent handle it those thoughts disrupted my tranquility luckily though as the data approach there was no time left to worry about anything but the mission our crew began adapting to a new schedule going to bed at 8 a.m. and waking up at 4 p.m. we were forced to shift our sleep cycle because those were the hours we would be working on the International Space Station the close we got to launch date the more lucid our mission objectives became our first objective was to transport a new crew member Nicole stopped to the ISS and then return home with another astronaut Tim Copera who had already spent more than two months in space second we had to conduct three space walks to replace one of the stations ammonia filled tanks last we had to make an attempt taken a Italian built portable laboratory called the multi purpose logistics module affectionate called Leonardo we also need to bring back to earth about a ton of equipment and waste no longer needed aboard the ISS with all that said we had only 13 days to complete our three mission objectives so you got a schedule had an up there a heavy schedule there they're not playing around they're going to get their money where fatten you exactly um um fast forward a little bit so I was a piece of my when I jumped into my space I was I was more than confident things were gonna turn out good when going for going fast forward a little bit when the whole interview process ended I along with 99 other aspiring individuals had nothing to do but wait about four months later I received a telephone call while working in my office frankly I was prepared for the response that I knew all too well however this particular call did not come from the center director or the astronaut selection manager Duane Ross it came from a senior manager Colonel Bob Cabana who is in charge of the flight crew operations director it and who is an astronaut himself I knew that if the center director was calling it was sure to be good news when somebody on the recommendation board like Bob was calling I really did not know what to think I was puzzled he started the conversation with the usual salutations and then went on to ask if I thought I was replaceable as head of the materials and process branch my response was genuine when I told them that I thought everyone was replaceable and that all along I had taken upon myself the responsibility to mentor and train folks to be ready to take my place good he said how would you like to come work for the astronaut office I quickly realized I had been accepted my whole body went numb the second it's not like that it's something that you have to train in constantly it's something that you have to work on constantly it's something that you improve on all the time it's a perishable skill by the way so that's why we created the extreme ownership academy go to extreme ownership dot com I'm on there three times a week two times a week four times a week answering questions you want to talk to me feel like I'd really like to meet charcoal just go on there that's that's the other thing about this leadership skill is that it helps to have a guiding you know a guiding hand a mentor you know somebody who knows what they're talking about helping you along the path you guys do that three times a week you and life you know on a live event you know JP Dave the echelon front instructors guiding you through this stuff So I've got to imagine, you know, he was really open to that and, you know, and I'm certain, you know, he didn't believe I can reach it, you know, obviously, but he was so interested in us getting an education that it's like, you know, he said, if that's what motivates him to go to college, finish high school and go to college, so be it. well you know again thank you so much thank you so much for joining us thanks for sharing your story thanks for sharing your experiences thanks for sharing your lessons learned unbelievable lessons learned and and thanks for what you've done for mankind to you know not only in the medical field and then in the final frontier of space and then on top of that what you're continuing to do right now with your foundations trying to get out there and get kids pointing in the right direction you know we talked about what happens when kids get pointed in the wrong direction we know how that turns out it's horrible and to see someone like you that we're able to overcome those boundaries and overcome the ultimate boundaries and make it to where you've made it just so much to learn and I just want to say thanks for coming on and thanks for sharing we appreciate it well thank you very much but it's also going to help me over here because you know I just read that the US and the newly form Russia signing agreement to build what was going to be the international space station so he didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out even though I am one you are one you know I am one I didn't take a rocket scientist figure out we were going to be working with the Russians so my great differentiator is during these next five years in this project I'm like I traveled more than 25 times through the Russian Siberian countryside and work with the Russians and all this you know help me get the upper hand on the other 14, 12,000 applicants because very few of them could save or claim similar experience than what I had and at least that got me in the door to get started getting interviewed and then the rest I would just sell myself and I said you know all these kids I'm going to miss you know their you know their boy scout their softball baseball prompts high school graduation you know this 15 years going to be 19 year already off in college I at least I assume he's going to go to college your hands whatever position your hands are that's how you're sleeping you know got this cool Frankenstein pictures of my crewmates like that because that's the way you sleep I mean whatever position you're in you're gonna sleep in that position but I'll tell you it was the weirdest feeling going to sleep the first in second night but after that I said you know this is the best sleep you can ever you know no tempered you mattress nothing mattress mac and Houston can sell with respect to his mattresses this is the best sleeping gear because you got no pressure us I was told by one of my class colleagues as he unbuckled my seat we padded one another on the back once I was able to stand up I exited the shuttle with a smile on my face the seven of us crew members were beyond ecstatic everything one is planned our mission commander began to congratulate us and said we did it we couldn't have asked for a better team all of us had to spend an extra day on the base before we were able to go home as I waited for the moment when I could go back to Houston I could not fathom the irony of my dream going into space both beginning in and concluding in the golden state as a boy I dreamed of becoming an astronaut as I picked crops as a man I would exit the shuttle as an astronaut on a landing strip located just a few miles from where I grew up picking strawberries it was poetic really there was truly this delightful symmetry to my life that helped me realize the importance of remaining humble and remembering where I came from epic and the story goes on here you go on to talk about retiring from NASA going into the corporate world as an executive you let me tell you a little bit about the retirement part of it it was a hard decision to to go about and deciding juggle because I'll tell you I remember when we've got back from from space shortly thereafter they announced the retirement of the shuttle fleet so they were going to retire the whole space shuttle program I think they had four or five flights more manifested and then after that program's over so because I know these people I know there you know it's tens of thousands that we depend on but I know they're here because they want to be here you know they're gonna dot their eyes and cross their T's because these are dedicated folks I mean I had first-hand working with them in the trenches I said you know this is you know there's there's a fine line where you know you do it for what you want to do for you and then that fine line of being more equal testical than you know not considering other folks and so you know I thought about it thought about it and then I'm looking at the screens giving them speed uh I give in them uh distance uh and and then also whether they're in plane or out of plane in terms of I give them numbers to indicate that if if it's all zeros it means they're coming in plane and then if it's a different number I give them so that they can provide some type of correction and they're doing all that but as I mentioned as you get closer you switch over to the fine jets which move you very little but our fine jets fail so there's no vernier jets so we got the big honking rough you know course jets that we can do so now our our our our commander CJ Sturk out of the good marini is um you know when you when you move a a vernier jet you know you move very little but when you move when you do the regular RCS jets it goes like that you know he was always he was always moving making little tactical moves that were serving that greater vision and even you know even when it came to when he was talking about retiring you know that strategic vision was still you know taking care of the family he had achieved that that high as goal and now the the vision was to take care of his family make sure they were good to go to the rock and roll now it's thinking strategic you get all time and you're right you see my post the other day we're making stuff we're making jeans we're making boots we're making geese for that you get to we're making sweatshirts hats just what what you need what that's what you what you need rash guards what you need we're making it we're gonna safety take tow boot now we got work heavy duty work pants just what you need and it's all made in America and it's not just made this is the thing I'm I'm big on this right now the the made in America thing not not just made in America but what origin is doing right now in America bringing manufacturing back to not just main now but North Carolina too where where origin is in North Carolina is 30 minutes from where I grew up that's huge man to know that down the road there are kids in my hometown right now that can go get a job at origin are you freaking kidding me I'm fired up not just made in the USA originated because the material originated in America the workers originated it's is American made and it's how we're gonna win the economic war absolutely there you go check it out origin USA dot com get some stuff get some stuff away it's Christmas time get some stuff for Christmas and so I told pop that so we can't pop that's that told pop say if I buy this vineyard would you teach me how to run the vineyard you say yes so these past five years with him you know he's 84 strong man it's good you know field work background he's strong and healthy you know this is the best five years I spent with him quality time he's teaching me you know what to fertilize how to fertilize one water I think we can all agree when you're going hot milk you're in your hoodie season hot of the whole hoodie season squat season that's what we're doing we've got hoodies there we've got women's gear we've got warrior kids soap made by aiden out there getting effort Irish Oaks farms jacco soap out here stand clean we've also got the shirt locker my brother echo Charles making my brother echo Charles the big ones at the other guy that here sometimes echo Charles is making a new shirt every month and they are certified legit shirts uh we were just at the jacco live saw you know troopers out there with the more past shirt on with the jacco ride and the tank I mean just all of all of these awesome shirts get on the shirt locker again subscription situation there subscribe to this podcast on iTunes google play stitch or wherever you listen to um leave reviews man they are hilarious and jacco reads them and they're awesome and so I think I made the right decision well that's definitely a difficult decision to make I know I was in the military and that's the the decision that military individuals like myself have to make at some point are you gonna keep going you're gonna keep going on the point you're you're talking about missing all those things I missed all those things I missed everything you know and eventually had to say I owe I owe a little something I've done what I can for the country I owe something that's the family that I've left behind for months and months and months and months at a time but I kind of liked it because you know it's California and I'm landing at Edward's Air Force Base I call it poetic justice because it's it's some 80 miles from Chino on Terrier where I used to pick strawberries so here here I am coming in with a you know in a NASA space suit I did a good old American flag on my shoulder and coming in as a US NASA astronaut when you know 40 years ago I was you know over there picking strawberries so I'm over there so excited and you know because I flew on the T thirty eight over the golf over the pond landed so there I am telling the Lita you know how I you know flew the T thirty eight jet we're back on how I saw these space shuttle you know to think that the space shuttle I was on the space shuttle at three four five in the morning Back to my roots and back to the fields and I became a a grave farmer and the reason why I was so into it was because first of all I know how to pick grapes but that's the only thing I know I don't know like did least go out about about running a vineyard but you know who does my dad my dad's worked in there all his life and I know you just gave some props to seal training I could tell you there's all kinds of knuckle draggers and see well I'm probably case case and point you know exhibit a that that what we go through is more about just being wet cold and miserable but so fast forward a little bit once our two years of training and testing over where you held a small graduation ceremony at Space Center Houston can't rumble the chief of the astronaut office said a few words before presenting each of us with a silver pin with the astronaut logo on it this is a symbol used for astronauts who have yet to travel in the space a gold pin symbolized that an astronaut has already flown on a mission so you get the new guy symbol exactly I was a great job you know two weeks before launch you and three other buddies as group of four astronauts you fly over from Houston to Florida where the birds at the shuttle and you start prepping the vehicle for launch so you start prepping the inside and doing testing with ground control and everything so you get everything ready for the mission and then uh and then uh the day of the launch then uh if you're the lead uh sea squared then you get the number seven on you know how you see all those white-tick-nissians the number seven's always the astronaut there's a was there's always an astronaut there because he's the one that buckles the there are fellow astronauts into the cockpit of every mission and unfortunately your face is the last one they see before they go up into space ha ha he was he was like he went with that to make it seem like yeah jacco is just kidding because he doesn't want he doesn't want to say the truth which is as you know at the critical junctures at the critical junctures there's usually a little bit of like you know that and you know I think it's a job where both parents have to be present and you know thumbs on on them to make sure that they just like my parents were with me make sure that they're you know on the straight narrow go ahead and in the right direction but but uh under way up one of my crew mates did get get sick to the point they you know they had to throw up but uh but it goes away you know after a day or so that feeling it's kind of like being in the back of a bus and going up a mountain curves and all that you kind of feel a little car sick nauseated And I wanted to say, look, it's okay if you don't reach your goal because as long as you give it your best, it's like my father would always say, you know, shoot for the stars, you know, worse that can happen is you're gonna be on top of the world, you know. you know the book says 4,000 that was when it first began but when I was in and at my 12th try we were up to 12,000 this past selection run they were up to 18,000 applicants so they filter it pretty well including the psychologists that filter everything that you know when they when they select you you know that they have a high probability 99.9% that you're gonna make it because you've been filtered you've been tested aptitude testing psychological testing stress testing so they have been feeling that you're gonna make it I mean you describe it here as each minute past the distance between our shuttle and earth lesson the planet also grew bigger in size before our very eyes which meant that we were getting close to the home in my mind I was counting down the minutes until we were safely on the ground our landing pointed Edward's Air Force Base in California was a mere dot on our map as discovery darted across the sky at high speed I saw in our instruments that we broke mock 25 at that point we were traveling at slightly more than 25 times the speed is sound I could feel the buffeting of this shuttle with the atmosphere and I noticed an orange glow outside our windows we were definitely in the atmosphere now I noticed gravity slowly taking its effect as the weight of my helmet attached to my orange LES became heavier out of 26,000 feet we broke through the cloud layer and I had a good view of the ground both below us and in front of us by now the shuttle had the characteristics of an airplane as the aerodynamic surface controls were responding to the commanders input the shuttle slowed down to normal airplane speeds and behave more like a glider would since it did not have an active propulsion system during the landing phase of the flight this of course meant we only had one opportunity to land it our commander in pilot had practiced these landing hundreds if not thousands of times in simulators and in actual approaches utilizing one of the two planes that have been modified to be able to fly the shuttle's landing profile at 400 feet with the gear already armed our pilot Kevin activated the gear down command this poised the wheels of the shuttle for contact with the surface of the pavement at Edwards Air Force Base in preparation for landing the landing strip was ready in no time soon thereafter we were literally racing down the landing strip until the parachute deployed and the pedal breaks slowly brought us to a complete stop the opening of the shuttle doors reminding me of the times I had to open them to welcome back the returning astronauts however this time I would be welcomed and indeed we were a welcome back that's the impression that I got when reading this also talking to Johnny Kim and is that if you get selected they have already they've already figured out because the thing that's interesting to me is you talk about you put in these failure failure situations over and over again and you know there's people that panic in those situations there's people that lose their cool in those situations there's people that don't on a handle themselves that's why I think it's interesting like just because you became a pilot well if you panic if you become a pilot you learn to get control of your emotions and not panic and same thing with scuba dive right scuba if you panic or your scuba diving or something goes wrong you're gonna have some real problems so those are things that they're looking at your application go well he's a pilot but then you get a sign to a mission and so that's what happened to me I participated about seven launches during those two years and the last two I was the lead sea squared and uh it's great because you go there two weeks before your uh you're in crew quarters uh so you you spend time with the astronauts you know they arrive about a week before the launch so you spend time with them uh before they're gonna go off to their mission you're uh your debriefing them on the status of the bird and how things are going and all that kind of thing any questions they have and I look at world my kids are right in life right now all college graduates my young seven year old is a freshman in mechanical engineering at UC Merced you know the PhD my three girls have their bachelor's one of them is finishing our masters in me and one of them is a big influencer in in in TikTok you know maybe and if you guys really want to have a laugh because I come on a lot she feels me a lot go at the Vanessa Hernandez yeah we got to jacco t-shirts on jacco store.com so we'll get back to that grounded podcast we have the warrior kid podcast for the warrior kids out there we also have jacco underground.com as you know look there's situations where we we have been banned in certain scenarios you don't like that at all I probably got banned today possibly because I told people to get off their phones get get off fight the algorithm fight the algorithm how happy do you think that algorithm controllers are when they hear that I bet you that thing gets beat down and freaking out the arms go on on a tige You know, I think everybody would, in the whole world, I was watching that because it was an amazement because to think that, you know, the Apollo rocket and the capsule, you know, which has less computing power than your average cell phone, was able to go and using vacuum tube technology, were able to go to the surface of the moon, send a couple of humans down there and then bring them back home safe and sound. and I'll tell you um it was even kind of crazy a little bit more crazy for us than normal because um you know nothing real big happened in terms of malfunctions during our mission except this one thing and um the shuttle has um built in jets to maneuver in space including the ohms engine orbital maneuvering system those are the big engines that we fire the slow down so that we can get back into the atmosphere but we don't use those for docking we have built in jets that are on the nose the tail and near the wings of the uh of the shuttle and they fire to maneuver in space and um and we have two types we have the regular call RCS jets reaction control system jets but I mean I'm sure it's similar to like for seal training as well that that you have to go through all these things but it's not only you know it's academic mental physical the whole combination of things where they really stress you and you know that's how they figure out you've got the right stuff if you're able to survive that then then you move on you get your wings politics you know it's kind of like you know I just don't have you know I have the stomach for a lot of things but I was one of the spokespeople in terms of telling the science part of it the results of how we what we measured and all that and and so I got a lot of face time with a lot of people at NASA and they ended up you know they started looking at me and trusting me and all that that that you know we came up with the with the story of how what was the root cause of the failure which is of course the piece of foam that did and but shortly thereafter the following year they have a selection a selection of astronauts and and I gave a lot of weight to the family and I'll tell you man it was the hardest decision in my life because you know we just got through reading what it took to get here to get there to get assigned and to be part of NASA and after flying only once here I am considering chucking it all the way because I could fly again but you know I kind of just thought about it, prayed about it I always tell people, you know, when they ask me what's your proudest professional moment, a lot of people expect me to say, oh, you know, I flew on Space Shuttle Discovery and went up into Space International Space Station and all that kind of stuff I was a flight engineer, but that's not it. and then you know posing kind of doing my best you know hero shots kind of thing you know So if there's a crack in there it's going to get in there and it's going to affect the structural integrity of the wing and that's what caused it to snap and create that catastrophic failure and pieces all over Northwest Texas occurred and so so during all this time you know the president had the Columbia accident investigation board or board form and since I was the branch chief I gave a lot of briefings of the findings you know there's a whole team's hundreds of hundreds of people that contributed certainly not me myself Yeah, and I have to, you know, I got to give more credit to my wife, I'll delete that, because I remember, once the, I got rejected the sixth time and I had, I had gotten the rejection letter and I even scrunched it up and kind of, I was in the bathroom shaving when I got an open it and I threw in the garbage kind it goes almost up to three G's a force right on your chest and that's three G's is about what is it three people that way exactly like you on top of you that's how three G's feel so I at at the mark of eight and a half minutes you're ready for this to be over you're ready for main engine cut off meco and and because when that happens you stop accelerating so that 500 pound gorilla disappears and now you're kind of loosey goosey in your seat but you got your seat belt on but now you're in a microgravity environment orbiting earth once every 90 minutes on a continuous base 17,000 miles an hour is 17,500 miles an hour you're traveling but because now you're not accelerating you don't feel the G forces so now you're it's kind of like being on a plane 500 miles an hour you don't feel that you only feel the take off kind of thing but was that faulty fuel valve would that have been a problem that's that that's you know the thing that we don't know you know we're kind of lucky the weather was bad And it says, and then he would say, you know, Jose, you know, you know, you were giving you a scholarship, right? And so, so, that's when I told him, you know, that's when I told him, I said, son, if wanting to be an astronaut motivates you to get your PhD, I said, you go on and be an astronaut because, you know what? and I said man I had to go out of this world to come to this conclusion that down there were all just one because borders are human-made concepts designed to separate us and how sad because from my perspective we're just one down there and it'd be great to have our world leaders give to give them this opportunity because I'll show you a world be much better now the thing that what the news got out of all this when I came home and you can look up the New York Times and the LA Times came up with the headlines saying Mexican American astronaut wants to open borders that's what they got out of this my star I say good good and and then and then to top it off you know my son my youngest son I told you it's going to use him or say it right he got accepted to the University of Pacific and he got accepted to UC Santa Barbara amongst other schools but the three he liked was UC Santa Barbara University of Pacific and UC Merced and I was certain he was going to pick Pacific or Santa Barbara and you know my favorite phrases hey this ain't rocket science I could make this I could make this probably more efficiently to you exactly and so so I started you know a couple years ago I started working with my own formulations and making my own wine and finally I settled on three concoctions that that we have and so I started my company again everything under Tierra Luna members Tierra Luna engineering remember my wife's restaurant and it was called Tierra Luna grill it's they caught s a s space adaptation sickness so it makes you feel a little nauseated you know one of my crew members lost their cookies you know I didn't I actually lost them on the way back which is uh one gee a re-adaptation uh I was told I was delighted to hear Carlos a famous Mexican reporter who had been following my story for some time truth be told I was terrified at the thought of knowing that millions of people in Latin America were going to see my interview it was only after I returned and conversed with him that I found out he felt the same way this was a historic interview as it was the first live interview from space conducted in Spanish the minutes went by so quickly that I felt my time was up just as I was getting started we we talked about the view of Mexico from space including the attractive coast of the state of Quintana Rue and the Yucca temple peninsula we also spoke about my inability to detect burp borders that defied Earth into countries there are no borders from what I can see up here our world leaders should see how beautiful and precious our world looks from this perspective I said to the reporter one world from up there And I love to tell the story to educators, because, uh, you know, I tell them, hey, I know you feel like you're not making a difference. I have a Tierra Luna engineering where I do aerospace consulting you know for example I help Mexico a buy and launch three communications satellites from Boeing Corporation I was at 1.2 billion dollar purchase for Mexico and they hired me because the under secretary of communications was he himself at midday he says look I'm an economist politician economist I know did least quite about satellites and here we are spending 1.2 billion dollars can you help us so I worked on a neat project for about four years helping them launch three communications satellites so they they can have internet throughout all of Mexico any population over 5,000 the government put a dish so they would have connectivity to the outside world which is which is pretty neat and I'm going again look you got to get the book if you want to get the details of what's going on and it's it's really fascinating to hear you know what you're thinking about as this progresses and all the things that you're working to go on the things that you do as a team but you don't want to go off that stuff you got to get that smoke if if you're still sore bro if that's that muscle soreness the doms get on that maltrain get on the way you with that we got we got by the way speaking of milk I just got to mention this it's hot milk season because it's a winter time even in California it gets little yeah um fast forward a little bit day three we're about 183 meters away from the international space station our shuttle began the 360 degree rotation for the purpose of being photographed using high resolution photography and video by the space station crew they take pictures from the space station of the space shuttle just to make sure there's no damage on lift off but that's got to be pretty weird to be up in space and you're 183 yards away from this other big chunk of metal traveling at 17,000 miles so we we basically expose them to those concepts that we know they're good we know what the core curriculum is so we expose them to those ideas in a fun experimental experiential way so that when they go back to school they said so I bring it home you know the first day they gave it to me so you know I want to try it on make sure it's the right size they gave me and all that
