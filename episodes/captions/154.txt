[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 154.
[00:00:03] With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:06] Good evening, I go.
[00:00:07] Good evening.
[00:00:08] And we are going to go into some Q&A today.
[00:00:11] Sure.
[00:00:12] We got a bunch of questions to go through.
[00:00:15] I asked if anyone on Twitter had questions.
[00:00:18] And I got a ton of them.
[00:00:19] So we're going to try and answer some of them.
[00:00:21] Some people, if you're listening and you ask the question,
[00:00:25] like, what time do I go to bed?
[00:00:27] Or what kind of workout do I do?
[00:00:30] Or something like that.
[00:00:33] Then I'm not going to answer it now because I've answered it a bunch of other times.
[00:00:37] There's a lot of fundamental things.
[00:00:39] Or it's in the discipline you go to freedom field manual.
[00:00:42] Or you know.
[00:00:44] So these were some questions that had some of them.
[00:00:47] Yeah, that we've heard some of them before.
[00:00:49] Maybe there's a different spin.
[00:00:50] But some of them I tried to pull back or pull out the fresher type
[00:00:55] of questions for this.
[00:00:58] And ones that aren't entirely fresh, I'll try and cover very briefly with whatever
[00:01:04] the new sort of anglers.
[00:01:07] Because there is a fact that you go to a class and you learn two or three new moves
[00:01:13] in Jiu Jitsu.
[00:01:14] And that's good.
[00:01:15] But you also review just a arm lock.
[00:01:19] And that is still beneficial, especially if it's from a new angle or a new instructor.
[00:01:24] They tell you, hey, you know, you move your hand a little bit further out on their
[00:01:27] rest if you're going for that thing and it helps you.
[00:01:30] Sure.
[00:01:31] So there's little details.
[00:01:33] Cool.
[00:01:34] So let's rock an old movie.
[00:01:35] Cool.
[00:01:36] First question, can you describe how difficult or no factor?
[00:01:40] Leaving your family was before deployment.
[00:01:42] I hate leaving.
[00:01:43] Okay.
[00:01:44] Let me just answer that one.
[00:01:45] Yeah.
[00:01:46] It sucks leave your family before deployment.
[00:01:48] That's the way it is.
[00:01:50] One thing that I've always said is, you know, to guys that we're saying
[00:01:54] no, I gotta, I'm gonna leave my kids and it's horrible to leave.
[00:01:58] And I'm like, yep, it is.
[00:01:59] And they worry about it from the kids perspective.
[00:02:02] I'm not gonna be around, you know.
[00:02:04] Well, here's the deal.
[00:02:07] Men have been leaving to go and fight wars and do what they got to do for thousands of
[00:02:13] years.
[00:02:14] And so your kids are gonna be okay.
[00:02:17] And what good is they will see what you're doing, see your service and your sacrifice
[00:02:24] and you stepping up and holding the line for the nation.
[00:02:28] And that will be a lesson that they will learn by observation.
[00:02:35] And so even they'll be sad.
[00:02:36] But inside they're learning.
[00:02:38] They're learning that there's things more important than yourself.
[00:02:41] And so it's a good lesson to be taught.
[00:02:43] Yes, is it, is it horrible leave your family?
[00:02:45] It sure is.
[00:02:46] But it is a lesson for your kids.
[00:02:50] And it is a sacrifice you're making for your country.
[00:02:54] And there are benefits to it.
[00:02:58] Your kids, you get to come home.
[00:03:01] And you'll see it and you'll see your kids, you know, be all excited.
[00:03:05] It's good.
[00:03:06] It's a good thing.
[00:03:07] So that's question one.
[00:03:08] Yes.
[00:03:09] It's harsh, but it's a worthy cause.
[00:03:12] Kind of second part to the question.
[00:03:18] Did you cry when you learned that your childhood friend committed suicide?
[00:03:21] Well, you were doing but.
[00:03:24] Okay.
[00:03:25] Yeah.
[00:03:26] So I mentioned that on a couple podcasts ago that my friend Jeff killed himself while
[00:03:31] I was going through ballets.
[00:03:31] He was a kid I'd grown up with.
[00:03:32] But I had I'd grown apart from him in the later grades, six, seven,
[00:03:37] eighth grade and through high school.
[00:03:38] We kind of grew apart.
[00:03:40] So I did not, you know, I was I was sad by the situation.
[00:03:45] But I didn't it wasn't super emotional about it because I we had kind of
[00:03:51] grown apart and it had been, you know, I was and was now in the Navy.
[00:03:54] So no, didn't cry, but was definitely sad about the situation.
[00:03:59] Is it I mean kind of back to that first part, but lean.
[00:04:05] Isn't like that like a healthy dose of that like good for the kids for sure?
[00:04:09] Because it's like now they know how to make do, you know, like if dad's there for
[00:04:14] every little thing kind of thing for sure.
[00:04:16] And then, you know, the in that middle day comes that you're going to go, you know,
[00:04:20] leave or the air at least they got to leave, you know, you don't have to depend on kind of
[00:04:23] dad being there kind of for you.
[00:04:25] The trials and tribulations and and those things adversity will make kids tougher.
[00:04:31] That's just the bottom line.
[00:04:33] So this is a adversity and it's an adversity that kids, you know, they they it'll
[00:04:39] make them tougher.
[00:04:39] Make them stronger.
[00:04:40] Yes, agree.
[00:04:41] Next wish any good recommendations for cutting back on alcohol.
[00:04:46] You know, just straight up why would you cut back and not just stop at this point in my life?
[00:04:55] I don't I don't drink anymore.
[00:04:57] And I know that some people have an alcohol problem.
[00:05:03] And so I think trying to cut back if you have an alcohol problem is in a realistic thing to do
[00:05:07] because you'll take that slippery slope and and just get drunk.
[00:05:11] Yeah. So I think what you have to do is just stop and I know that and again, I I'm not I don't
[00:05:20] I don't have a good familiarization to know what it's like to be addicted to alcohol.
[00:05:26] I didn't even I didn't even really like consciously.
[00:05:29] Oh, I'm going to stop drinking now.
[00:05:32] I just stopped drinking because I was out of the navy.
[00:05:35] I was working a bunch and carrying on and wasn't around those, you know, my bros anymore.
[00:05:40] Where we'd go out and have a beer.
[00:05:42] And so if that's not happening, then it's not happening.
[00:05:45] And that's one thing I'll all say is I know that people that have alcohol issues addictions.
[00:05:52] They always say you've got to change the people places and things that you do.
[00:05:56] So the people that you hang around with that like to drink, you can't hang around with them.
[00:05:59] The place that you go with everyone likes to drink, you can't go to those places.
[00:06:02] The things that you like to do that involve drinking, you can't do those things.
[00:06:05] So there you go.
[00:06:07] I would say stop drinking and hey, if you're an alcoholic, you got to get medical supervision
[00:06:12] because that's actually you can die if you're an alcoholic and you stop drinking.
[00:06:16] So you have to you have to like go and get help.
[00:06:20] But stop.
[00:06:23] Yeah, a lot of those times those the people who are that far into alcoholism where they stop drinking
[00:06:28] and they die.
[00:06:30] That's like usually they don't even want to stop drinking.
[00:06:33] Usually that's just how I'm drinking usually.
[00:06:36] But I think I might have more experience on this one.
[00:06:40] 10 year.
[00:06:41] But all those things I meant that's like a really concise and it's a good way to put it like the people
[00:06:49] placing things, right?
[00:06:51] Actives you would ever.
[00:06:53] But a big part of it and I said this before where a big part where I would stop drinking
[00:06:57] it was way easier when I just understood what it was.
[00:07:00] You know, like understood like why am I just wanting to drink?
[00:07:04] And why is it that when I start drinking like it's kind of harder to stop?
[00:07:09] You know, then maybe I don't know the next guy or whatever.
[00:07:11] And then when I once understood like what's happening physiologically or whatever,
[00:07:16] I came up with my own little strategy and the big part of it was like oh yeah, like my brain
[00:07:21] is like tricking me into thinking like yeah that you want this this thing or whatever.
[00:07:26] That was like a major one and the other one was kind of has to do with the people placing things.
[00:07:31] It was where if I had a reason not to drink like if I had a workout that I really took seriously
[00:07:37] the next day or if I was going to record or something, do to do something where to be hungover
[00:07:42] whatever would really mess me up.
[00:07:46] It'd be way easier.
[00:07:47] You know, so back like you know in high school but in college like kin athletics and stuff like that.
[00:07:53] You never really drink during the week because you had practice the next day.
[00:07:55] You don't want to be hungover in practice, you know, so it'd be really easy.
[00:07:58] Yeah, I'm going to drink in today kind of thing.
[00:07:59] So if you can kind of set up your life where you have like something important that you can kind of look
[00:08:05] forward to and really care about the outcome of something that's not necessarily mundane in your
[00:08:11] in your mind because a lot of times that all kind of it's a slippery slope when you're like yeah it's
[00:08:15] important but it's mundane in your life you'll be like let's see how I can endure it kind of hungover.
[00:08:20] It's kind of worth it.
[00:08:21] I'll pay the price now you know what kind of thing.
[00:08:23] But yeah if you can set up your life where you have something that you find like important
[00:08:28] to be functioning fully that helps.
[00:08:31] Yeah, due to.
[00:08:33] Train, due to one Saturdays.
[00:08:35] Yeah, it affected me when I was in the teams and we got drinking on Friday and then when I started
[00:08:40] training due to all the time I didn't want to I wanted to be good to go for due to so yeah I just like
[00:08:45] started started to stop drinking on Friday and I'd hard.
[00:08:47] I would say this with due to, I would say compete in due to then because
[00:08:52] but and I don't know people are different you know there's a spectrum but
[00:08:56] to me you just I mean all train hungover, due to in fact due to help say hangover.
[00:09:02] If you can drag yourself out of the house yeah which is actually isn't that hard once you do it once.
[00:09:07] If you go if you're hungover and you're like oh man I really don't feel like I'm in a due to right now
[00:09:11] but you just do it the first time you do it that's the hardest time every other time you're like yeah
[00:09:15] I did it for this easy I'm not gonna be suffering you go you know depending on the level of
[00:09:20] hangover you're gonna suffer in due to or maybe not after what you used to it.
[00:09:23] I don't know maybe it's what it out. I was training like at a higher level and I mean like
[00:09:28] seriously not trying to be like a jerk but like I would this is back when I was training training
[00:09:32] with Fabio and so Dean and I would choke when we trained for like three hours straight and like
[00:09:37] hard and so if you're gonna come in and do four rounds yeah you're a little hungover it's no
[00:09:42] big deal but if you're gonna come in and you're gonna train for you know an hour worth the
[00:09:46] class then you're gonna roll hard core for for two hours you're not gonna trust me you're not
[00:09:51] gonna want to be all hungover dehydrated and jacked up mentally. Yeah I dig it and if you're
[00:09:58] gonna train fat hard then yeah don't you probably it's gonna be hard to drink and I mean that's
[00:10:03] that's your typical person not gonna train that hard I mean yeah if you're drinking too much
[00:10:07] if you're a competitive no even people who don't drink don't train that hard typically in my
[00:10:12] experience I don't know but if you're training for a tournament it's gonna you can take it way
[00:10:17] more seriously just kind of in the back of your mind you know it's not just like oh you're just the training
[00:10:21] so again I'm not saying so that's not gonna work if you're just practicing so it won't work
[00:10:26] I'm not saying that I'm saying people are different and if I use myself as an example like I
[00:10:31] could I could train I could hang I was I was training with like when I when I'd go
[00:10:37] training like at auto so whatever with these crazy training sessions yeah I would go slightly hungover
[00:10:41] go dean every Friday so okay look of course I could probably train better if I didn't
[00:10:49] drink the night before for sure but I'm just saying as a as a catalyst for stopping drinking
[00:10:55] that didn't help you it didn't help me as much as it made yeah it didn't even it wasn't even like a
[00:10:59] catalyst to help me stop drinking it was just the functionality of life yes was oh I've got to do
[00:11:06] this in the morning cool I'm not gonna get all hammered tonight so I can do better yeah as a human
[00:11:12] yeah and that's really the format right there where you find so I mean to me you know like you're
[00:11:17] not like jiu-jitsu just the training if I wasn't if I was competing or I'd easily stop drinking
[00:11:23] easily but just for the training if I didn't have a competition or whatever it wasn't it didn't help
[00:11:29] as much as one might think but if I had something like you know if we're recording or something
[00:11:35] something who that you would think you might be able to even it just depends on how important it is
[00:11:40] for you to be functioning at the best level you can you know if I get tapped out a few more
[00:11:44] times and you just it's kind of like whatever so it just depends on who you are as what I'm saying
[00:11:50] you're like that either way yeah I mean I think that helps but that's gonna be hard
[00:11:56] either way if you don't have some kind of like format scaffolding in your brain to kind of like a plan
[00:12:02] you know like a little strategy to be like yeah I'm just gonna drink less just kind of just
[00:12:07] gonna drink less yeah it's pretty rare that's gonna yeah yeah that's why cut back I don't I say
[00:12:13] don't cut back to stop you check next question communication is often used as an excuse both
[00:12:24] under and over oh under communication and over communication for why the direction isn't clear
[00:12:31] any suggestions on balancing comms communication up and down with the right level of detail
[00:12:38] here's a jacked up answer the answer to this question of how to balance comms is comms
[00:12:43] you own balance communication you have to communicate you have to understand hey do you
[00:12:46] guys know what's going on you need to check and make sure that they know what's going on
[00:12:49] if they know what's going on great if they don't know then you didn't communicate with them enough
[00:12:54] if you spent too much time communicating and now they're looking at you with a blank stare like
[00:12:58] hey bro we got this then you communicated too much so and ask them hey do you understand what's
[00:13:03] going on cool and if not do you understand why we're doing what we're doing cool all right good
[00:13:08] I'm gonna let you go do it now so the answer to making sure you're not communicating
[00:13:14] either too much or too little is communication I hate to say that but that's what it is
[00:13:19] there can be some of that can be non-verbal communication you know you can observe
[00:13:24] if you if you give your guys a task and then you go out and observe them and you see that they can
[00:13:28] execute it really well then you know that you've done a good job communicating that to them
[00:13:32] if you go out to observe them and they don't know what they're doing and they don't know what's going on
[00:13:36] and then you realize how I didn't give them enough information I need to communicate more
[00:13:39] so you don't have to necessarily ask them you can tell through observation and checking on them
[00:13:45] and seeing where they're at and what they're doing if they actually understand what's going on so
[00:13:49] yeah that's that's it pretty straightforward get your little feedback loop going
[00:13:53] yeah that but it is kind of like and I'm gonna use the word again dance it is kind of like
[00:13:59] a dance though it's an academy yes you can you can communicate too much and you can communicate
[00:14:04] too little and you have to find the balance thing because if you communicate too much people
[00:14:08] stop listening to it and then it's no longer communication at that point because it's kind of like
[00:14:12] if you're sleeping and I'm like hey okay Jocca told me what to do like you you can't hear me it's
[00:14:16] not going into your brain it kind of has to go in your brain what I'm saying you got to kind of
[00:14:20] your does you got to catch what I'm throwing yeah and you know and vice versa if we're
[00:14:25] quote unquote communicating so yeah over to quote quotes around the case it's just a word
[00:14:29] I'm just alright there you go but if one of those even one of those things isn't happening
[00:14:35] we're technically we're not communicating so like the whole over communication thing that's like
[00:14:39] yeah someone talking too much another guy stops listening are you over communicating so far in this
[00:14:44] spot it's not you know I'm just saying like how you say like feedback you know like that
[00:14:52] that's an important thing because if you're like blah blah blah blah and how you say the
[00:14:56] blank stare communications gone communications not going on you look on my face right now yeah
[00:15:01] like the one that's blanks you know you can't even see back which is good see I'm saying so
[00:15:05] now I'm clear I'm clear that you want me to move it along see I'm saying it's good communication
[00:15:09] on your part here's the thing with you and your blank stare in my experience which I have
[00:15:14] a lot by the way your blank stare communicates way more than just like a blank stare
[00:15:21] for real yeah Mike Sarelli would we'll tell you all about that like you'll you'll have a whole
[00:15:26] conversation with me and not even say one single word for real I know exactly what you're saying
[00:15:32] see like right now I know exactly what you're saying anyway next question that's exactly what I would
[00:15:37] say actually like I said when taking ownership how can you prevent your boss
[00:15:42] thinking you're a complete screw up and stop it from escalating to a point where there
[00:15:48] where he starts blaming you for things you're not actually at fault so this is one of those
[00:15:54] catch 22 situations where you actually don't think you're at fault so when you actually don't
[00:16:00] think you're at fault then you're thinking oh I'm just taking ownership so that that's like the
[00:16:05] cool thing to do that's what I'm trying to use this as to make to improve my situation right I'm
[00:16:10] gonna I'm gonna quote unquote take ownership and when you quote unquote take ownership but you
[00:16:16] actually don't believe you're at fault then you're not you're not really taking ownership so
[00:16:21] when you look around at your mission at your tacit what you're being told to do and you say oh
[00:16:25] I've got to do this thing oh it didn't go right and I'm gonna take ownership of it and get it fixed
[00:16:31] if you're just saying that and you don't actually mean it then your boss starts blaming you for it
[00:16:35] well you you you should feel that way because when your boss blames you for something you know
[00:16:41] you should be saying yeah boss I know I said that this was my responsibility and this is what
[00:16:46] I'm gonna do to fix it you shouldn't when your boss starts blaming for you for things you should say
[00:16:51] well no actually that's not my area of responsibilities what you should say is oh yes boss like I just
[00:16:56] said this is my fault and here's what I'm gonna do to fix it that's what you do so you actually
[00:17:02] think about this when you're when you're the type of person that takes ownership of things
[00:17:09] you actually can't get blamed for the things you can't blame me for things because I'm already
[00:17:15] volunteering and saying that this was my responsibility and I'm gonna fix it so
[00:17:21] that's what you do that's what you do you take ownership and you take real ownership which means
[00:17:25] when there's a problem you look at it and say this is hey this is my fault here's what I'm
[00:17:29] gonna do to fix it and when your boss says hey yeah yeah this is your fault you go I know boss
[00:17:36] I know 100% and this is what I'm gonna do to fix it and then you go fix it yeah and the thing that
[00:17:41] I didn't know is I said this before too but I think it's easy to sort it forget when especially
[00:17:46] if you're thinking like this which is which I dig man is the whole what am I gonna do to fix it
[00:17:52] because when you when you like for real take ownership whatever it's because man just like I
[00:17:58] said it's almost like what you just said where where you say you can't blame me you can't blame me
[00:18:04] because I already took responsibility kind of thing because and in a big way it's not necessarily
[00:18:09] about blame it's more about fixing problems that course on a come up nothing's perfect you know
[00:18:15] so now it's like it's more of like a way of dealing with problems less than a whole blaming take
[00:18:20] blame in culture in business in terms of really for blaming each other yeah that's what happens
[00:18:25] and if you're the person that says hey you know what this is actually my fault and this is what I'm
[00:18:30] gonna do to fix it there you go yeah then that blame you you could say yeah blame me I'm the guy
[00:18:36] because that's the guy that made this mistake yeah yeah and then you can just focus on fixing the
[00:18:41] problem and you're meant to that and that's the thing is the reason I bring it up is because it is
[00:18:45] easy to forget that part because that blame is still in the problem part yeah yeah yeah with extreme
[00:18:50] ownership I mean up here obviously because it's like hey I took in kickstream ownership like
[00:18:54] why yeah why didn't you do how are you saying it's my fault yeah yeah yeah that's not the main part
[00:19:01] of me and part is like you gotta fix it yeah you know yeah I think so all right next next question
[00:19:08] I have two warrior kid daughters who are very much on the path with pretty much everything but
[00:19:14] snacking they're they're starting to put some weight on as a result despite tons of physical activity
[00:19:20] and good eating at meal time how can I coach them in this area without being overbearing
[00:19:27] I would say don't have snack food in your house that's junk which you probably do
[00:19:31] don't and yeah that's that's real simple what are they gonna do if there's no snack food in
[00:19:36] house how are they gonna snack you know the answer is they're not because they can go out and eat grass
[00:19:42] from the yard if they're still hungry but so that's that's one thing the other thing is you got
[00:19:48] to be careful with with kids and I'll say this with girls especially you start throwing that like
[00:19:55] hey you need to watch your weight you can really mess with their body image so you got to be really
[00:19:58] careful about what you're doing with the kid with a with a little girl guess what little girls little
[00:20:03] boys guess what they are when they're when they're little the little pudgy little creatures you know
[00:20:08] and sure there'll be some genetic kids that are have 2% body fat and a 12 pack of abs when they're
[00:20:15] 6 years old but most kids are like little little bit pudgy that's part of their prepping for
[00:20:21] their growths perk and if you're all freaked out about it you know just what you're gonna do
[00:20:27] is you're gonna put that in their head they're gonna start looking in the mirror and you don't want
[00:20:30] to do that to your kids so don't have any junk food snacks in the house give them some milk
[00:20:35] right give them some warrior kid milk because it tastes delicious it is like a snack and it's good
[00:20:39] for them and it'll be it'll be satiating I know you don't like that word echo but it'll
[00:20:43] satiate them and it'll make them feel full so that's that's a good kind of snack food to have in the
[00:20:49] house and if you're gonna have other snack food then make it beef jerky make it some health these
[00:20:53] you know some carrots some some celery you know make it some good healthy stuff but um yeah like
[00:21:01] worrying about your kids starting to put on some weight when they're I don't know how old they are
[00:21:05] in this particular case but just be careful you don't want to you don't want to freak your kids out
[00:21:09] and get them with a with a really paranoid body image especially girls they're getting it from
[00:21:14] million different directions and you gotta be careful with it because that's a real that can
[00:21:19] be turned into a real problem and the thing that that actually you clarified really good to me one
[00:21:26] day where when you kind of implement change you know in a routine is especially if snacking is kind of
[00:21:32] like a routine you know whatever when you implement change like it's good there's gonna be some hiccups
[00:21:35] there you know like whether be I don't know in this case like complaining like hey well you know
[00:21:40] you're saying hey don't keep snacks in the house so now there's no chocolate cover pretzels anymore
[00:21:45] you know like hey I remember the chocolate cover pretzels they were right there in the little
[00:21:49] pantry right there now they're gone like what up I haven't seen them in days yeah like hey
[00:21:52] we're not doing the chocolate cover pretzels anymore yeah or whatever there's gonna be some
[00:21:56] blowback there especially from the little kids you know they can be like well at that you know
[00:22:00] there might be some complaining so I think if we go in or when we go in knowing those
[00:22:05] things that helps a lot so you're kind of prepared for you know you can kind of plan what you
[00:22:10] can say are hanging hands in way to intense with this but there's no chocolate covered pretzels
[00:22:14] guess what they didn't have met the store I'm not getting them they're bad for us yeah I did it but
[00:22:18] a lot of times when you have you know two girls or whoever you get a lot of bar yeah but they're
[00:22:25] not getting your kids like pull up bar train yeah but they're not gonna be like hey oh well
[00:22:29] no chocolate pretzels oh I'll just do pull ups it doesn't work like that with the little kids
[00:22:33] you got it not that big of a deal to take to pull a snack out of your house yes I don't
[00:22:36] especially if you get some beef jerky and you're like oh you know what that's a bad for us and
[00:22:40] I don't want to eat anymore so I got beef jerky here it's really good taste it yes but to be
[00:22:44] great see weed deal the dried seaweed oh yeah like you used to eat that stuff like it was like they
[00:22:47] were damn octopuses but that's good there okay bye yeah yes I like the dry seaweed yeah
[00:22:54] it sounds pounding some of that the other day with both my kids they're like in salty
[00:22:57] delicious anyway what I'm saying is I'm not saying necessarily make it a huge deal I'm just saying
[00:23:03] if you're ready for the blowback you know because what if you're not ready you think that okay
[00:23:07] I'll agree with you just to to we can move this conversation along in order to prep for
[00:23:11] you stop the chocolate covered pretzels and you don't really agree you can come up with a
[00:23:16] a plan of action little plan of action and immediate action drill when that six year old goes
[00:23:21] dad where are the chocolate covered pretzels you have a very well-rehearsed response you can
[00:23:28] do some roleplaying with your wife and you go yes see let's see what you're doing in the
[00:23:35] moment I'm telling you this helps this will help okay because you you know the the
[00:23:41] pork is you care you know you care about the short term a little bit too you know of course
[00:23:46] a long term you know that's what you're doing the whole thing but you gotta do is explain
[00:23:49] hey you know what hey we're not doing that anymore because it's not good for us okay straight up
[00:23:53] cool there it is that's not a huge well we're doing it anyway roleplay with your wife
[00:24:01] no next question why isn't MMA or did you to a bigger component of law enforcement training
[00:24:10] just seems to be a huge missed opportunity yeah it certainly is a huge missed opportunity I
[00:24:16] I plead with all law enforcement personnel to train Brazilian GJ2 MMA wrestling boxing
[00:24:25] Mojtai as much as you possibly can and I plead with law enforcement agencies of all types
[00:24:32] that I talk to to get these types of programs in your departments because there is no doubt
[00:24:39] that it will help you it help your officers be better and more prepared to handle situations on
[00:24:46] the street just had a police officer coming here the other day that was just signing up and you know
[00:24:51] she just got down to the police category and I'm so thankful that she's here because I'm like yes
[00:24:58] go and start training immediately and it will be so beneficial for you in your career in your life
[00:25:06] and one thing about all these things and any form of martial arts for like self defense or
[00:25:13] self defense situations or you know because that's sometimes when it turns into for a police officer
[00:25:17] they're no longer you know once you things things cross over from where they're on offense to
[00:25:22] where they're on defense and for a police officer this is a great example like this was a female
[00:25:27] and hey could a female 118 pound female police officer take a guy that was drunk slightly drunk
[00:25:39] a wrestler whose 240 pounds the answer is no she's not gonna farewell in that situation but
[00:25:49] if she knows if whatever she knows if she knows if she's trained she might be able to prolong
[00:25:56] that conflict long enough for her backup to arrive she might be able to stay alive keep control
[00:26:01] of her gun whatever you know keep control of the situation long enough that she that she will
[00:26:08] get her backup there so that right there that's the same thing I tell females that want self defense
[00:26:15] it's like hey look I'm not saying you can't because you look at some of our female
[00:26:19] jujitsu players they will choke out a dude deflect straight up they will arm lock them like for real
[00:26:26] and a 200 pound wrestler they'll put a guitino on them and choke them put them sleep so that's
[00:26:32] that can happen that's what someone that's really skilled to make up for their lack of strength
[00:26:37] and lack of size being a female but what if even if you're not that good but you can post
[00:26:45] phone you can prolong someone trying to grab you and take you somewhere someone trying to do something
[00:26:49] to you you can prolong it the longer you can delay the the offense from taking place
[00:26:57] the better chance you have of somebody else coming along or somebody noticing or that person
[00:27:00] just giving up because most most criminals are you know weak minded and they don't want that kind of
[00:27:05] resistance so yes totally you're asking why isn't it there's a bunch of reason why it isn't
[00:27:13] and one of them and I've talked about this before but there was there's been cases where people
[00:27:20] that were not trained enough they were trained enough to be dangerous where they've choked guys
[00:27:26] to death and that has happened you crush someone's windpipe you can be screwing around
[00:27:31] and or you just not screwing around but you can be screwing around you could you know you and I
[00:27:35] could could start wrestling around if you and I were white belts and we started going out at
[00:27:40] really hard there's a chance one of us could get the other one in a chokehold had a couple drinks
[00:27:44] in us and next thing you know I put you to sleep which is oh yeah I'm gonna put you to sleep
[00:27:51] because sometimes you choke your friend you're like I'm gonna put you to sleep
[00:27:54] well if I'm drunk and you're drunk and I put you to sleep and I don't really know that you're
[00:27:59] a sleep yet and I'm squeezing extra hard because I'm drunk next thing you know I look up
[00:28:02] and all of a sudden your highway bone is crushed your wimppipe and you're now gonna die so
[00:28:08] that's happened in law enforcement they've banned chokes which is a horrible thing because choking is a
[00:28:14] is one of the best and most minimal forces to use to subdue someone is to choke them even an
[00:28:22] armlock is gonna break their arm it's gonna ruin their tendons it's gonna hurt them a choke
[00:28:27] doesn't even hurt someone it just puts them to sleep just make a pass so but that's one of the
[00:28:33] reasons why they don't teach it as much the other reason is they don't give enough
[00:28:38] training to law enforcement officers and they need to they train an absolutely pathetic
[00:28:46] amount of time in what they call defensive tactics generally they please officers call defensive
[00:28:50] tactics which is them fighting and maintaining weapon retention and all that they train
[00:28:57] a very small number of hours a year they measure the time that they train in in a year in hours
[00:29:04] that's how little they train so my my campaign I'd like to go forward with is I think that police
[00:29:13] officers should spend one fifth of their active duty time training one fifth of their time should
[00:29:19] be training that's the way it should work and I don't know how I'm gonna start that ground wave but
[00:29:25] there's that's such a solid idea that no one can argue against it there's not one single argument
[00:29:33] against every police officer spending one fifth of their time training and and if you want to
[00:29:39] argue with me about that and the argument is well we won't have enough police officers out on the beat
[00:29:44] then and here's the question back at that would you rather have eight highly qualified highly trained
[00:29:51] officers out on the beat or ten officers that were barely trained at all and the answer is so easy
[00:29:57] that question so that's a bunch of things I'll continue to push that as much as I can and I know a
[00:30:04] ton of law enforcement people listen to this and just you know I think that's a great idea to start
[00:30:08] pushing from the ground from the grassroots we want one fifth of our time training it's going to
[00:30:14] make us all better it's going to prevent think of all the time that's hours that are wasted in legal
[00:30:19] actions after there's a bad shooting or an injury or something like that think of all the stuff
[00:30:24] that gets wasted there take the officers and train them properly that's what that's what needs to
[00:30:28] happen so hopefully it will and then what would you suggest that I mean kind of isn't what you can
[00:30:36] say but suggest like you know police officers going and getting training on their own so like you know
[00:30:42] yes if you have to go get training on your own go get training on your own because most
[00:30:46] due to places they'll have a law enforcement like some kind of you know yeah yeah yeah actually
[00:30:51] this guy you know Craig right and now me yeah yeah yeah okay police officer up in Oregon
[00:30:56] and from not mistaken always doing due to like with his uniform on and you can look look
[00:31:02] look him up on Instagram you can see all the stuff he does with due due to any applies it to law
[00:31:07] enforcement yeah yeah and it like man it's such a clear demonstration of the benefits and you know
[00:31:13] whatever everyone who trains like you know it's like man it becomes really after you train for a while
[00:31:18] all this dealing with other people in chaotic situations right he's literally easy yeah it's easy
[00:31:23] so man yeah get watch Craig and his stuff and I don't and here's the thing though I don't know
[00:31:28] how that works with like work and you know hey you're at risk of injury I don't know I don't know
[00:31:33] what the whole deal is but man the way I say it man trains or Craig's over there training all the time
[00:31:39] train and so man yeah just train on your own until your situation arises with the law enforcement
[00:31:49] yeah well hopefully they'll implement that sometime in the future man next question
[00:31:55] bow or not okay and due to his three months in professor not bowing I don't
[00:32:03] other practitioners bow no one told me when in Rome versus I'm not in a herd respect a professor
[00:32:10] mats and practitioners this pretty simple question some people bow when they go on the mat some
[00:32:17] people bow to the professor some people don't I don't I just kind of do whatever and it doesn't
[00:32:22] really matter to me and there's a little bit of paranoia in the question which I I understand which is like
[00:32:28] hey hey when in Rome do his Romans do but at the same time you know I'm going to hold the line
[00:32:32] kind of on my personal value so it's like I don't I'm not bowing right that's not my gig or I
[00:32:37] it's respect you got about like there's both those extremes and both of them can be articulated in
[00:32:43] a way that's fine and to me I'm just like whatever oh everyone looks like everyone's bound cool in
[00:32:47] the bow and not that big of a deal I don't I don't freak out about it it's not that big of a deal I think
[00:32:52] it to me to me the overall arching principle of my actions bowing or not bowing is more based on my
[00:33:01] overall principle of not making a spectacle out of myself one way or the other like I'm not here to
[00:33:07] like draw attention and be like hey I don't bow or hey this is jujitsu you need to respect them that
[00:33:14] I'm like over here just trying to train yeah not trying to make a big deal out of myself yeah so
[00:33:20] if everyone's bowing it's that cool like they know no big deal I get it or if no one's bowing and it's like
[00:33:25] hey I don't know big deal yeah I guess people might be disappointed better I have some hard stance right
[00:33:32] yeah but I don't yeah there's there's some things I don't worry about that's one of them yes
[00:33:38] I believe that yeah how about we just trade yeah agree and that's that'll sort of itself out anyway
[00:33:43] because if you're at a school because some schools sort of require that's the protocol here at the school
[00:33:47] no big deal but you can have that exact attitude be like cool that's what we're doing that's cool
[00:33:50] because some people you bow on the mat you bow off the mat you at the beginner class to the you know
[00:33:55] to the picture whatever at the end like the whole deal but same deal it's like bowing's not hard to do
[00:34:00] it doesn't like you know affect your family life at home or nothing like that it's just just bow
[00:34:06] same thing we're not bowing doesn't affect your yeah it's not hard to not bow down now I guess there's a line
[00:34:11] in either direction right there you know where you could you know you could be telling me like okay
[00:34:17] when we bow you need to bow and you need to praise yeah praise the praise instructor whoever
[00:34:24] it's like hmm okay probably not I'm probably not gonna do that you know like we're not we're not
[00:34:29] worshiping right we're not bowing it's like okay a little sign respect cool I got that but we're not
[00:34:35] gonna turn a respect into a worship there's a line that that will not be crossed the other
[00:34:40] direction is like oh you know someone's teaching a class and I'm just gonna you know run my
[00:34:45] mouth and walk on a mat like it's no big deal now like you're gonna be respectful to the instructor
[00:34:49] of course so I'm just gonna find out little balance there balance those two dichotomies so what if
[00:34:54] you go as a guest or whatever and another place and there their protocol is in your opinion like
[00:35:03] sorted crossed over to worship I haven't really been through an academy or whatever in worship
[00:35:08] but let's say it did just a little bit like would you go as a guest do you just go through the
[00:35:13] motions of respect for I might what I would probably do is go through the motions but then do
[00:35:19] other actions that would indicate to everyone that I have a free mind and that I'm not down
[00:35:26] with what they just did type of scenario like I wouldn't be obnoxious about it but I'd be like oh
[00:35:31] you know what I'm gonna do is take off my gear and sit on the mat right now like yeah oh oh that's
[00:35:36] not a lot okay sorry cool oh my bad though yeah you know big they put it on like I you know cool
[00:35:41] whatever just kind of like just indicate would you say at my academy like we don't care about these
[00:35:46] small things yeah maybe like um I don't know if I do that because then you're just trying to
[00:35:51] try to again make a spectacle I'm not trying to make a spectacle man I'm just trying to
[00:35:55] just try to just try to be you know just trying to get some training and to be honest with you
[00:36:00] I just go get training yeah so don't make a spectacle and get in the wet and let that spectacle get in the
[00:36:05] way of your training yeah how often are we making I mean how often do people try and make
[00:36:11] spectacles out of themselves it's like people do that yeah and that's not cool like don't do that
[00:36:17] don't be a spectacle just be you know I thought a story before about the the when I went to
[00:36:24] the University of San Diego and there was a professor there that was like oh she was an American but
[00:36:30] she was a Buddhist monk right you know so she had at some point converted to Buddhism and and she
[00:36:37] would shave her head and walk around in the robes and stuff like that and I was like we know one of
[00:36:41] the tenants of you know being Buddhist is to like not make a spectacle for yourself and yet here
[00:36:47] you are walking around a western campus you know you know in a uniform with a shaved head that's
[00:36:53] not that's not that you are making a spectacle of yourself so I was just like I would I would think
[00:36:59] it would be more like the Buddha to just wear you know a pair of jeans and a t-shirt and just have
[00:37:06] like whatever normal just be a normal just like as normal as possible yeah there's a whole like
[00:37:12] there's a whole thing that's sort of my that's sort of I I fall into a I fall back on that you know
[00:37:17] like a lot yeah so because you think that she might argue well this is how a some Buddhists
[00:37:25] like minimalize our whole efforts to have individuality or whatever but at the end of the day you are
[00:37:32] yeah like we're just like when you're in Thailand which is awesome like the Buddhist monks
[00:37:37] they're everywhere and they're that's what they do and so they're not making a spectacle of
[00:37:41] themselves at all and they come around and get rice in the morning it's very cool it's a very cool
[00:37:46] culture but if you're in a culture of a Southern California university there's no other Buddhist
[00:37:53] monks that are walking around so you kind of and hey maybe I'm wrong you know I'm not trying
[00:37:58] to disparage you know this individual I'm just saying from my perspective I was like if you really
[00:38:03] want to have the the low profile and not bring attention to yourself and give up you know give up
[00:38:13] the the trappings of ego right you want to give up the trappings of ego then you don't want
[00:38:20] people to notice you if you don't want people to notice you you dress like a gray man you just
[00:38:25] just like kind of normal you know forgettable yeah so anyways I'm trying to get like deep into
[00:38:32] the religious aspect of jiu jitsu and robes sure but that's just kind of my opinion I dig it
[00:38:44] next question did you ever have cct did you ever have a cct attached to your unit and if yes
[00:38:54] how was having them alongside and what advantages did they bring to the battlefield so cct is
[00:39:00] an air force combat controller and their special operations guys they're awesome guys they go through
[00:39:05] really hardcore training and I didn't really I worked with them occasionally not very directly
[00:39:14] on a couple occasions they were great guys but I never worked with them enough to to be talking
[00:39:19] about them all the time because I just didn't have that experience you know and don't talk about
[00:39:24] bull riders either because I don't know many of them you know so it's just it's just it's that but
[00:39:29] they're great guys I know they have an awesome reputation and my friends that work with them
[00:39:33] loved work with them if there was a guy that was I've had a couple guys kind of heard names of so
[00:39:39] for as far as coming on the podcast yeah of course I never fallen on the podcast of uh with our
[00:39:43] question no problem and what we what we had was we had anglico which was Dave Burke and his
[00:39:48] guys they were the guys that were doing the cct type mission for us when we were in remoddy so
[00:39:54] uh that's one of the reasons why we didn't work with them very much on that deployment the previous
[00:39:59] deployment we had my own I had my own jac and that's who we worked with so just just just
[00:40:04] uh just didn't have that opportunity so they're awesome guys though. Next question juggle currently
[00:40:11] in a busy and stressed place in life and keep looking back at what could have been how do you
[00:40:17] bounce back to doing you and not getting in your own head appreciate what you and I could do thank
[00:40:24] you both for and got blessed. All right you know we can look back all day long at what could have been
[00:40:29] and it doesn't matter well the only thing that matters from the past is what you learn from it
[00:40:33] so let's learn from it and look at the future and one one thing I'll say is
[00:40:40] it's like they're saying about when's a good time to plan a tree do you know when the
[00:40:45] good best time to plan a tree is right now either 22 years ago or right now right like that's
[00:40:53] look you didn't do it then so guess what you can do you do it now when's the best time to start
[00:40:57] a savings account. Yeah the same thing like I you know 20 years ago or right now so
[00:41:05] if you sit there and say oh well I could have done if I wish I would have done this years ago
[00:41:09] I wish well guess what you look up at a year and you don't have that little sattling now
[00:41:13] you could have a little sattling right you're nothing so it's not that big of a deal
[00:41:18] hey hey you you you went through life you made some you wasted some time good you didn't waste
[00:41:24] it completely first of all you learned from it you got experience you had fun you did other things
[00:41:28] you you learned about you learned about relationships because some girl dumped you and you
[00:41:33] realize that you can't overcome it to a to a liar you know you like you learned these things right
[00:41:37] so just because things were negative experiences in the past and they didn't feel good to go
[00:41:42] through doesn't mean that they were all bad because you still took something away from you
[00:41:46] and you learned from it so that's part one part two is what are you going to do plan a tree today
[00:41:52] that's what you're going to do plan a tree today and start to nourish that tree and take the
[00:41:57] lessons that you learned to sprinkle on that tree and feed that tree so it can grow fast that tree
[00:42:02] that you plant today should be able to grow faster than the one you would have planned 20 years ago
[00:42:05] because you have the knowledge on how to on how to nourish that tree and feed that tree so it can
[00:42:11] grow quicker so just get on the path don't don't play around with what's going on in the past
[00:42:15] learn from it move on you man that goes along with how like that little speech it wasn't a speech
[00:42:21] but a little talk you had with me about you know you got to play the long game or whatever and
[00:42:28] in kind of in this case same deal where it's kind of in more so than even play that you are playing
[00:42:32] the long game but keep the long game in mind because that's what you know those thoughts like
[00:42:36] dang I should have I should have went to college or I should have chinointica I don't know
[00:42:40] whatever this whole what could have been kind of deal that's like your mind saying like right now
[00:42:45] if I would have done that back then right now I would have this and that's the part that kind of
[00:42:50] message like jams you up mentally right where you're like man I could have had this right now so when you
[00:42:54] think so you don't you so as a result typically in my experience anyway which is almost none
[00:43:01] but typically I think like wait I because when I think of what could have been because of this
[00:43:07] thing that I kind of want right now I don't want a seed right now I want what I could have had
[00:43:13] and that's what I want I have that so point to see yeah so but like I emotionally or mentally
[00:43:18] you that's not where your mind is your mind isn't like hey I can't have that I accept that so let's
[00:43:22] you think of the future now your mind doesn't do that it's more like hung up on on that right
[00:43:27] of what you don't have right now that empty void that you have you don't want to feel that void
[00:43:33] with a seed the seed doesn't do nothing for me that even a sapling that's a full grown tree that's
[00:43:41] what I want right now that's what I could have had so how is a seed the problem or or the solution
[00:43:47] to my problem but if you're looking at the big picture the long game is you so I'll
[00:43:52] like pointly put it at the better the seed is nothing but a tree at a different time that's really
[00:43:57] what it is seems aimed so that is the problem that is a solution seems aimed and that might be
[00:44:02] the most philosophically bold and and unbounded statement you've made on this the seed is nothing but
[00:44:10] a tree at a different time like I did that good job it's all the more fit the pain and suffering
[00:44:19] listening has finally paid off good good cool man thank you anyway so yeah I think if like
[00:44:28] you can keep that long game in mind that's helped me like a lot with just even like small little
[00:44:34] things you know stuff is like uncomfortable I want to do this right now but you know this exact thought
[00:44:39] like man I'm I'm looking forward to the day that I'm not I'm thinking the opposite of what could
[00:44:43] have been I'm thinking now I'm thinking I'm so glad I planted that seed last year or whatever
[00:44:49] you know so you can look at the long game and kind of fulfill all that stuff sure all right anyway
[00:44:54] next question hi jockel and echo and name is both by the way here but hi jockel and echo
[00:45:00] quick question I really get I get really bad anxiety doing almost everything for example when talking
[00:45:07] to people I always feel like as if I'm gonna say something stupid and this makes me start to
[00:45:13] stutter and lose my train of thought and I just go blank hey it's on that one first of all
[00:45:20] you got a condition yourself you know you got a practice you got a rehearse I'll actually first
[00:45:25] of all I would say go get some speech therapy if someone to help you out because that will that will
[00:45:29] be beneficial to you getting someone that's a professional to to come in and say like okay here's
[00:45:34] the drills that we're gonna do my buddy that drums in my band he there's drumming drills that you
[00:45:40] can do so you can get your left hand to do something different than your left foot and your right
[00:45:47] hand to do something there's drills that you can do to overcome because if you're like me you're
[00:45:52] not a drummer I my right hand and right foot are gonna do the same thing at the same time my left
[00:45:58] hand and my left foot are gonna do the same thing at the same time but there's drills that you
[00:46:01] can do to overcome that and there's drills that you can do with speech so you can practice and you
[00:46:06] rehearse and you think about it then you'll get better at it and the cool thing is like once you
[00:46:12] start to build some confidence then you get more and more confident and you'll get better and better it the
[00:46:17] other thing I would say is talk about things that you know right don't try and explain things that you
[00:46:23] don't know don't try and come up with some theory that you don't understand and try and just roll it
[00:46:28] out off the tip of your tongue because you don't know it so just when that's happening just sit back
[00:46:33] and kind of formulate your thoughts and think okay of all the things I'm thinking right now what
[00:46:36] do I actually kind of have a grip on maybe it's a question sometimes forming something in a question
[00:46:42] will make it easier for you to state it because you're saying hey I got a question and now you're
[00:46:46] not putting pressure on yourself to come up with this perfect yarn of why that you this theory that you
[00:46:52] out instead you post something as a question that'll take some pressure off you and talk about things
[00:46:56] that you know and if you don't know it then ask a question about it and that'll get you more
[00:46:59] comfortable and you keep talking and keep trying and over time you'll get better and better at it
[00:47:04] but yet you have to you have to not jump in like don't go and volunteer to give the speech at the
[00:47:12] local club right no volunteer to when people are having a conversation say hey can I ask a question
[00:47:19] about this start with that that's like the easiest entry point no it's expecting you to say anything
[00:47:25] brilliant when you ask a question then it's expecting you to ask a question yeah so it's not that
[00:47:28] big of a deal and then just build on that man it's exposure therapy exposure therapy next wish
[00:47:36] when you transitioned from E to an O how did your approach working with with man you previously
[00:47:46] served with as enlisted now that you were an officer this is such an easy question because
[00:47:53] the bottom line is when I transferred from being an enlisted guy to be an officer I didn't change
[00:47:57] anything in the way that I treated everyone I treated people the same and when I was a young
[00:48:03] enlisted guy or senior enlisted guy well more senior I was never like a I only made it to E five
[00:48:09] before I went officer but when I was in my third platoon with other guys that were not in their third
[00:48:14] platoon I treat people like hey man with you know hey this is what we're gonna do this how we're
[00:48:19] gonna make it happen now I gotta caveat that for the guys that were in pltunes with me when I was in the
[00:48:24] E five mafia hey I was a little crazy with the hazing and like you did suck to be a new guy
[00:48:30] in one of my platoon so I get that but as you guys have told me you appreciate it once you got a
[00:48:37] little you know once you saw the big picture there was appreciation but no from a from an actual
[00:48:43] working relationship hey you know what are you gonna do you gonna stay humble you're gonna treat
[00:48:47] people with respect regardless if you're above them or below them in the chain of command there's this
[00:48:53] saying that I didn't talk about when we had Derek a Raron and it's it's pulled from that speech
[00:49:01] by Jacqueline by gunnery sergeant Jacqueline he says at the end of the speech he says
[00:49:06] not above you not below you always beside you so think about that from a leadership perspective
[00:49:12] not above you not below you always beside you so then if you have that attitude look I'm not above
[00:49:17] when I'm not above you and I'm not below you like where equals and we're trying to figure out how
[00:49:23] to best solve this problem and if you treat people like that regardless if you're above them or
[00:49:28] below them in the chain of command you'll treat with respect and humility you'll be fine and that's
[00:49:34] what I did I didn't treat anybody any different and I mean I had I had guys that worked for that
[00:49:38] worked for me that had been my peers or that I had worked for before when I when I went through
[00:49:46] that transition and it was like no factor it was literally no factor because these guys were you know
[00:49:53] when we were friends we worked together we focused on getting the job done when they were above
[00:49:56] me in the chain of command what did I do I worked hard to focus on getting the job done when they
[00:50:00] were below me in the chain of command oh no it's like hey they're working hard did they become a
[00:50:04] less of a person did I become more of a person no no I put a different rank on my sleeve what does
[00:50:10] that mean nothing it doesn't mean it it means yeah what does it mean it means that I'm going to be
[00:50:18] given this brief instead of some other guy cool no big deal you know what why don't you give the brief
[00:50:22] I'm fine with that yeah so yeah respect humility and never above you never below you always
[00:50:30] besides you it's a good little thing to think about there okay did you ever have the
[00:50:35] situations where you throwing darts at the guys back at the bar you know for your hazing situation
[00:50:40] no sure we did some pretty we did some pretty rough hazing though for sure you know lots of
[00:50:47] yeah it was it was not fun it wasn't fun it wasn't fun you know and and it was part of the ritual
[00:50:53] back in the day it's not as much as it any as it is not as much as that anymore but you know guess
[00:50:59] what guys are fighting a war now so I'm not like oh little guys don't have it or sorry guess what
[00:51:04] when I got when I was in the teams it when I first got to the teams it was like oh cool you're in the
[00:51:08] teams yeah you're gonna get hazed oh guess what these guys are getting nowadays they're gonna get shot at
[00:51:13] they're gonna get you know hit with iEDs so not that big of a deal it's just a little bit of a
[00:51:20] culture change and that's the way it is next question that caught a minute of leadership has some
[00:51:25] great principles what is an appropriate philosophy concerning time to train versus manage out
[00:51:31] a direct report when they have been in the role for over a year yeah this changes from industry
[00:51:38] industry to industry to spend depending on the situation that you're in and sometimes you don't have
[00:51:42] you have a really tight timeline to get people up to speed and if they don't get up to speed you
[00:51:46] got to get rid of them otherwise it's gonna cost the team or it's gonna cost the company money
[00:51:50] so how long you're gonna give them you're gonna give them as much time as you think you can
[00:51:55] give them before they start detracting from the team you're also gonna make sure that you're not
[00:51:58] investing so much time in a one person to try and get them up to speed that you're ignoring
[00:52:02] everyone else and now it's having a negative impact on the team so you just gotta look at the
[00:52:05] timing again I work with construction companies where if they don't get a job done on done on time
[00:52:09] it'll cost them $60,000 a day they don't play around like they're using someone that's going to
[00:52:15] be able to get the job done you get some sales organization that's commission only and there's
[00:52:20] somebody that's taken a while to get up to speed they don't really care it's not cost in the company
[00:52:23] anything so you got to figure out in your industry how much time that looks like and then you
[00:52:28] got to set the expectations clearly and once you've done that you say okay listen bud I've been
[00:52:33] working with you for this amount of time here's where I want you to be at this date if you don't get
[00:52:37] there we're gonna move you out man it's the way it is pretty straightforward
[00:52:44] next question I have to co-exist at times with an individual who knows I'm X Army he purposely
[00:52:50] makes pro-tally band quips to piss me off as I'm in a position I can't do much about it
[00:53:00] his intent to anger works but I don't show it what's some advice yeah I mean this guy's just just
[00:53:10] I would just completely ignore you know and actually you know hey that's funny man cool
[00:53:14] he's obviously trying to get under your skin and just don't let him get under your skin that's
[00:53:20] just all there is to it this person is worthless and just ignore him I mean you could go to the
[00:53:26] extreme of taking like in marks mission where mark actually gets in on the joke you know and
[00:53:34] if you want it you know but then you might be crossing again I don't know the specifics of the situation
[00:53:40] because there's times where that's not like I wouldn't do that in certain situations like
[00:53:45] like no I'll ignore you but I'm not gonna play along with this joke the way you're saying it
[00:53:49] but there's times where I be that oh yeah guess what you know I might play along with a joke just to
[00:53:54] diffuse it again if this might be a this might be a guy that doesn't deserve that but yeah
[00:54:01] ignore it man go don't even worry about this idiot that's that's my advice yeah that
[00:54:05] ignore thing you do that super good where it's literally like you feel like you don't you got
[00:54:13] no feedback from my little joke like if I make a joke to you or something and it's almost like
[00:54:19] did he not hear my joke because he just sort of moved on you know kind of thing and it's really
[00:54:23] compelling me to like not tell that joke anymore you know kind of thing and I'm assuming
[00:54:29] it works really good actually and he actually did have an example like the guy would say
[00:54:36] hey you're aiding the Taliban with this with the check this week like I don't know if the check is
[00:54:40] junk or this week's check anyway yeah so it seems like he's trying to be funny you know like
[00:54:46] he's not trying to be a dick to the guy like he says he's purposely trying to piss him off
[00:54:51] and yeah so for me if you're purposely trying to piss me off
[00:54:54] pitting me getting pissed off is you running that's the thing I'm not gonna let that happen yeah
[00:54:58] you're gonna win how am I gonna win by not getting pissed off yeah and you're a little
[00:55:02] and you're ignore tactic that you do in real life by the way yeah and I'm not saying like the
[00:55:07] ignore where you're like like a little kidty horse like a little kidty glee just ignore him and they
[00:55:12] like turn their back now it's like yeah you know just like yeah just like meaning was like you're
[00:55:18] your little quips literally mean nothing to me whatsoever yeah and that's a skill too which
[00:55:28] apparently you've honed over the years because it is and you gotta you can't oversell it you can't
[00:55:34] oversell ignoring somebody otherwise you're like you're not ignoring I got the power so you can't
[00:55:40] oversell it and you know underselling ignoring means like you're not really ignoring I guess but
[00:55:45] if you can nail it if you can nail it like literally your joke or your comments or whatever
[00:55:51] are falling on deaf ears you know and they don't like affect me at all if you can nail that
[00:55:56] yeah I would say that that would compel the normal person or this kind of person whatever to stop
[00:56:02] it where I think that works with everybody even little kids once again you don't make a
[00:56:06] spectacle out of yourself you're gonna let it roll like you're not making a spectacle of like
[00:56:10] I'm ignoring you don't make a spectacle of like hey shut up you just play in the metal and
[00:56:15] you just go through the because because there's things in life that don't matter yeah I'm not saying
[00:56:24] that you that there's that there's things that you don't react to because there certainly are
[00:56:29] and I'm not saying that you want to be this neutral person through for all things but there's things
[00:56:35] that just don't matter yeah there's things that just they just don't matter this is one of them
[00:56:40] this guy doesn't matter what is who is this guy yes it matter so don't put any effort into them
[00:56:45] just stay neutral oh give him a smile on a nod and keep doing what you're doing another tip too
[00:56:51] for this don't tell other people like oh yeah no man you forgot about that never totally just
[00:56:57] forgot about never tell anyone when something pisses you off never you know that way because if you do
[00:57:05] and then you're you're nailing the ignore tactic you're nailing oh yeah delivery perfectly
[00:57:10] and then you tell you told your friend or whatever like hey so that guy knows that always
[00:57:17] just ignoring me but I really pisses him off you know so just keep doing it and and here's the
[00:57:21] thing too about playing the game like um or or going along with the joke like oh yeah that's funny
[00:57:28] you just basically you kind of involve yourself in the game yeah he's not getting the payoff necessarily
[00:57:32] but he'll just change his tactic because you're still in the game with all you want to you want to
[00:57:36] get out of the game that's why that's why in that particular situation you know mark in Mark's
[00:57:40] mission was trying to befriend yeah yeah yeah yeah so that's a different situation he's not just
[00:57:46] trying to diffuse or he's trying to actually befriend him and so then he need to make a connection
[00:57:53] let's the clear difference if this guy was like a coworker or a boss or a subordinate then
[00:57:59] trying to build a relationship with then I might take a little step you know and again
[00:58:04] am I gonna joke about somebody being pro-talibant I'm not probably joking about the Taliban
[00:58:11] very much probably not no yeah cool next question is it better to remain single if you have a
[00:58:20] dangerous or demanding career in order to protect your family from unintended negative consequences
[00:58:26] or find a partner willing to embrace the risk and raise where your kids together hey man
[00:58:34] it's hard to live the life and it's a lot harder on your family than it is on you because you'll
[00:58:39] be over getting after it and your family will be at home not knowing what's going on with you
[00:58:44] so it's hard but I mean obviously having kids and raising a little warrior kids with a
[00:58:53] partner that's in the game is is awesome it's hard to find someone to get married to that's that
[00:59:00] good to go in the game especially if they're really young so I got real lucky I married a girl that kind
[00:59:07] of got it we'll say and and I said this when I was on Ben Shapiro's show that the quality that she had
[00:59:16] that still has that I think is is the most important is emotional independence and I don't even know
[00:59:25] if that's the thing I don't know if I just made that up but that's trying to describe that
[00:59:29] you know my wife doesn't need the the hey honey from me she doesn't need to like a hey how's
[00:59:37] everything going she doesn't need that from me she's fine she's emotionally independent and of course
[00:59:44] she's independent in the way that she can take care of whatever the kids and the puking kids
[00:59:49] and the kids diapers and the kids with and the broken water heater and the flat tire on the
[00:59:54] cause you can handle all that stuff too when I was gone a lot but most important is she could
[01:00:02] she she didn't need the constant like emotional recharge from me because she's an independent
[01:00:08] stable human being of her own so I think that's the kind of thing you've got to look for now
[01:00:13] unfortunately a lot of times dudes are attracted to the person that's emotionally dependent on them
[01:00:21] because it makes no it's a little ego boost it makes him feel good like oh she needs me around
[01:00:27] and it's like that's so you got to watch out for that you got to find someone that kind of has
[01:00:31] their own thing going on which also has to be balanced because if you find a female that is too
[01:00:38] has too much independence then guess what she's gonna be around you can find somebody else so you
[01:00:45] got to find that balance as well but if you can find that that right person don't rush into it
[01:00:51] take your time and and and she's in the game then yeah man get after it
[01:01:00] gonna say that's a good question yeah it is like and you know a lot of times guys guys and
[01:01:05] here's another like this is just an it's an answer that's not really an answer and yet it's fully
[01:01:10] an answer hey I'm married and I'm thinking about going the seal team to what will this do to my
[01:01:15] marriage it's like oh there's a 50% chance your marriage is gonna get destroyed because you're
[01:01:21] gonna be gone all the time your wife is gonna be jealous of the teams she's gonna be jealous of the
[01:01:27] travel she's gonna be pissed that you're not home she's gonna be pissed that when you get home you're
[01:01:31] going to the bar with your boys instead of going to the recital for the daughter like that's that's
[01:01:38] a reality so yeah I can't recommend it at the same time if you're square away and you have a good
[01:01:45] relationship yeah it'll be awesome it'll be awesome but it's it's a really hard like when guys
[01:01:50] when I meet a guy that's 19 years old 20 years old and he says yeah you know I'm going to buds
[01:01:56] and I'm getting married this summer before I go straight up that's a bad idea that's a bad idea
[01:02:03] don't do that if you're not situation don't do that because if you are if you have a great
[01:02:09] relationship with that person say look I'm gonna go through buds I'm gonna be focused on that it's
[01:02:13] gonna take me some time I'm gonna show bit of team I'm gonna go on deployment I'm gonna come home
[01:02:18] it's gonna take about three years for all this to happen when we get done with all when I get
[01:02:22] done with all that we'll get married because we are so strong and so tight that we can get through
[01:02:29] three years without you know being married we cool let's see what kind of response you get for that
[01:02:37] because it's non-committal right because it's showing the female hey I'm non-committal
[01:02:43] when actually you're saying listen it's not that I'm non-committal I don't even know what
[01:02:46] I hold in the future I don't know what the future holds for me it's gonna be crazy I don't know
[01:02:49] what's gonna happen I don't want to drag you through a bunch of crap let's just pause on moving
[01:02:55] forward with the marriage part and once we get done with that you know give me give me two years
[01:03:02] give me three years and then you can see if you still want to be around you you think you want to be
[01:03:06] around right now you haven't had a you haven't had a dude that's going on deployment for seven months
[01:03:11] after he gets done with it one year work up where I was gone in 12 months I was gone nine months
[01:03:16] that's a whole another thing you you may not want to be in that situation you know maim
[01:03:26] so if you're in that situation yeah don't get married and do people pull it off sometimes yeah
[01:03:32] Flynn Cochrane got married I think before buts and so that's that's one guy but but it's a
[01:03:40] rare occasion and most of the time it doesn't work out as well as Flynn and it worked out for Flynn
[01:03:47] why did it work out for Flynn one of the reasons he married a girl that is emotionally independent
[01:03:53] and can do her own thing and wasn't waiting on you know that that that emotional boost you know
[01:04:01] so there you go and so it's and and here's the the final answer it's like you know
[01:04:07] what the right answer is you actually know it so many questions you actually know the answer
[01:04:13] too you want reinforcement of them and but but the only person that can answer these questions
[01:04:21] is you the person you got to listen to what I'm saying sure but you got to look at your
[01:04:27] future spouse and be like or potential spouse you're the one that knows
[01:04:31] mm-hmm now what's hard is guys especially guys they go head over heels for females yeah they go
[01:04:41] crazy they go nuts they don't even see straight yeah you can't I had guys in seal platoon
[01:04:49] where I was like listen hey bro this girl that you're involved with right now is going to ruin

[01:05:01] know you want to get married in two weeks so far she stole your credit card she's called the command
[01:05:10] four times to request to talk to the master chief about your orgars this girl is a nightmare
[01:05:16] please do not marry her and guys like bro you don't understand and that's the way guys do
[01:05:23] and how do I know that because I was the same idiot when when you're 15 years old oh my god it's the
[01:05:29] only no it's like no that's not the only girl it's not there's more so just calm down
[01:05:37] if you can if you if the marriage is meant to be let it be but let it be in a year let it happen
[01:05:43] in here don't be getting married in three months don't be getting married in two months don't
[01:05:46] don't don't get married in six months get married in a year get married in a year and a half
[01:05:51] do me a favor do yourself a favor do us all the favor that there you go
[01:05:58] sounds like sound advice thank you next question could you talk about how you read a book
[01:06:04] to get so much out of it that you do oh yeah um here's what I do in a read a book i read the book
[01:06:10] as i'm reading the book i highlight the important parts of the book then i go back through and
[01:06:15] reread what i highlight and pull out the pre the the creme the lacrim of the information
[01:06:22] another small thing if you're reading a book with lots of characters write down the characters and
[01:06:27] kind of like give them a description so you can refer back to them when they show back up again
[01:06:30] because sometimes i'll lose track of characters if it's a complex book and you just don't you just
[01:06:34] don't know um so that's what i do i read slowly i actually it's horrible i wish i read faster
[01:06:41] i read at the speed that i talk just about i read a little bit faster but it's just about the
[01:06:45] speed that i talk and i read every single word i want to i will say this when i do read a book
[01:06:51] slowly and like i do read i remember a lot from the book which is cool but read it slowly
[01:06:59] highlight it take notes there you go mix next question what was planned be if you
[01:07:07] rang the bell um there was no i wasn't gonna ring the bell wasn't gonna happen it's seriously
[01:07:12] wasn't gonna happen and but well here's what could happen injury you can get injured in butts
[01:07:18] yeah and some injuries are more preventative like shin splints if you train properly before
[01:07:25] hand you probably won't get shin splints but if you're doing rock porridge and you there's big
[01:07:30] waves and you're bringing a boat a zodiac boat or a ibs boat up the rocks in big waves you can
[01:07:37] just get your knee broke like you can happen so then what would happen if i would have gotten out of
[01:07:42] you don't go on to the fleet healed up come back so i would have done you know try again it's uh
[01:07:49] that's one of the scariest things about butts from a guy that like the guys that i know that
[01:07:55] were like yeah we're never gonna quit but they there's a possibility you're gonna get injured yeah
[01:08:01] can you get rolled they call it rolled yeah you get rolled back what but it like even if you get sick
[01:08:05] right like a doctor can be like hey you can't continue yep that can happen that can happen
[01:08:09] to guys in hell week they'll get pneumonia and they're just they can't like they're they're not
[01:08:15] quitting but they're coughing up blood they're speeding blood out of their mouth and they're like
[01:08:23] and the doctors like hey are you okay but i'm fine yeah and so they just have to they just have to
[01:08:32] get rolled back yeah it happens there's very few people that don't get rolled back oh yeah it's
[01:08:37] pretty small number that don't get rolled back at all really yeah like for medical
[01:08:42] medical failure if you fail something you get rolled back you fail a run i forget i don't know
[01:08:48] what is right now when i went through if you failed to run okay you got to write up if you failed
[01:08:52] another run you got rolled back see good to do the whole thing again you gotta do the whole thing
[01:08:56] yeah not just the run you gotta do everything again yeah yeah yeah oh thing oh it's a night
[01:09:02] so i failed a run us swim a obstacle course like and then you just freaked out
[01:09:16] i was so okay i think you could actually when i went through you could fail one per phase
[01:09:21] so there was three phases first phase second phase and third phase you could fail like one of
[01:09:26] each thing per phase which is with sounds really lenient but dang you're doing because you're doing a
[01:09:32] time run every week and a time run every week and then you're doing a million they just call
[01:09:39] a conditioning runs which is the most understated name for run ever because what they really
[01:09:47] were is just the most grueling as fast as you could go through the soft sand runs like for how
[01:09:53] long for air mouth no no no no no no and not only that you ran to you ran to breakfast and back
[01:10:00] then you ran to lunch and back and you ran to dinner and back and each one of those runs was
[01:10:03] one mile so there's six miles before you ran anywhere before you conditioning run and your time
[01:10:08] run you're doing a six mile run every day just that's awesome that is like that's not a sprint
[01:10:16] sometimes you have to run fast sometimes you run slow but it's just like a lot of times just the
[01:10:20] little you know typical military shuffle yeah so yeah
[01:10:28] no man.
[01:10:31] Question what actual strategy should a jiu jitsu white belt employ during a roll other than
[01:10:37] relax tap early tap off and etc.
[01:10:39] Well those are the key points but the other thing is I would say try and do moves that you've
[01:10:42] actually learned instead of instead of doing something that you that you just like you're
[01:10:47] spashing out trying to do some random thing you actually do something that you know and if you
[01:10:51] get in a situation that you don't know what to do remember the situation you were in since you
[01:10:55] can ask an instructor hey here's where I was I didn't know what do you can you please help me yeah
[01:11:01] simple pretty straightforward yeah next question if a coworker were attempting to bully
[01:11:09] intimidate or make you generally miserable do you go with it would you make a mention of your
[01:11:16] jitsu knowledge or keep it a surprise I like that question oh yeah I would keep it I'm I keep
[01:11:25] everything a surprise right I just keep everything a surprise because I'm not here like
[01:11:33] hey you know I do jitsu you better back off you know like what is that and then said you're just like
[01:11:39] hey man all good you know and then let that guy find out for himself that you know the hard one yeah
[01:11:47] either the hard way or someone will be like hey man you know that guy that you keep messing with
[01:11:50] like I train jitsu every day he's gonna choke you up put you to sleep and then guess what he's
[01:11:54] gonna do he's gonna be a mouthy because he's already been he's already been testing you and he's like
[01:11:58] oh he's kind of a whim so yeah I mean there's no like is there even a cool way you can say I
[01:12:04] train jitsu no because even if you pull it off externally like internally you're like you know
[01:12:12] who said it cool John Cloud Vendam hoiler Gracie hoiler Gracie did it was surfing
[01:12:20] and I think kid Belegro told me this story but it might have been hoiler that told me this
[01:12:24] he was surfing and somebody wanted to know give him some beef get nuts if you wanted somebody wanted
[01:12:30] it like you know hey what are you doing out here times thing and he was like you know he did
[01:12:34] what I would do it see you know you just kept surfing kind and then the person started talking
[01:12:39] more and then he started running his mouth and then hoiler said something like um hey you like to surf
[01:12:51] I like to fight if you want to fight we can do that and I thought that was a pretty cool
[01:12:59] way to say it he told that story I think I was unless he told another time to you at Bryan
[01:13:05] Sargent's promotion to Blackbelt oh you were I think kid Belegro was here too I forget but yes
[01:13:10] he told me that story to like the group he told it to me and I thought you were there right
[01:13:17] yeah he was yeah I thought there was like kind of more actually he said it's cooler than that
[01:13:22] he said it cooler than that he said it some way that was like yeah listen you like to fight
[01:13:27] you like to surf for your life I fight for my life yeah you you surf for a living I fight for a
[01:13:34] living it was something even more than what I said but it was good yeah we can fight it kind of you
[01:13:38] can surf yeah it was a kind of thing where you're like if you were that guy you think you know
[01:13:42] you know yeah maybe I'll not do this whole thing right now I remember thinking the same thing is you
[01:13:49] like dank those are really dope what it's saying you know plus like you know that that guy obviously
[01:13:54] he didn't know who that was I'm assuming which would be kind of crazy if he didn't or if he
[01:14:00] did know who he was but and then what if hypothetically later he found out like who that was
[01:14:05] and he'd like occasionally I've had people say things like like they kind of know
[01:14:11] who should I say like oh you know let's go you know something like that yeah and it's like yeah
[01:14:15] yeah I mean cool that's always mine that's awesome yeah cool like you want to go now and then
[01:14:20] there was like oh no no no just kidding all right next question what do you typically
[01:14:28] wear when you meet the bosses of companies and why oh uh they meant if you're working with
[01:14:34] Ashland front then pretty much what we all wear is the the EF pillow the Ashland front uh
[01:14:41] pillow shirt and you know we we we called the what we wear business tactical yeah just pillow shirt and
[01:14:49] pair of pants and what the question is why well that's just because it's uh it to me it's the
[01:14:56] same kind of thing I've been talking about just sort of a normal thing to wear right um don't really
[01:15:02] travel as much as I travel as little as possible I came with a full suit and yeah so just comfort
[01:15:09] and functionality yeah there's the answer yeah and of course you'll show up in your shorts yeah
[01:15:16] no no we're a professional and rascar yeah the remember you used to wear suit right like back
[01:15:23] in the yeah I mean and I still wear well wear a suit sometimes but usually not man usually not you know
[01:15:29] even um usually people people know who we are now yeah and so if we're gonna show up they realize
[01:15:37] what they're getting which is like hey these guys are these guys are gonna comment and talk to us
[01:15:41] and they they know what the deal is yeah there's all the footage of us on on the videos and stuff
[01:15:46] where we're in kind of the EF uniform so business tactical get some all right next question
[01:15:53] and I guess there is a there is a a small bit of like hey we're not we're not standard business
[01:16:01] people you know in a man yeah that makes it it's like hey like you're in a room with people with a
[01:16:07] bunch of suits on and they're like oh who's presenting oh it's that guy over there because he's
[01:16:11] wearing something different okay we get it you know in a man yeah just a little identifier
[01:16:15] echelon front on the shirt oh good how do you grow better faster stronger with your romantic
[01:16:25] partner over time without being a brute I just I don't even I just kind of had to put this
[01:16:31] question in here because it was I don't really understand I mean just because you're bigger and
[01:16:35] faster and stronger doesn't mean you're a brute right what what is that I don't how do you overcome
[01:16:40] that be nice to your you know your girlfriend whoa you know wife um what's the your romantic
[01:16:47] partner like what does that mean no like with if you're working out with your romantic partner
[01:16:51] or like you're getting bigger and faster and stronger and therefore you start treating your
[01:16:56] girlfriend like crap like no it's like no it actually you'll probably be nicer because you're
[01:17:03] bigger and faster and stronger so it's kind of a non-question I guess but I just thought it was funny
[01:17:09] because you think you think I'm gonna do squats today then I'm just gonna go beyond the
[01:17:14] normal man being a brute look the being a brute that part I can see that you know because you
[01:17:25] know like let's say like you gained 20 pounds 30 pounds it's just and it's like all muscle you're
[01:17:32] super strong now you know and you know you come home you're just more of a like the stuff that you
[01:17:38] do you know you're vacuuming you know like you're just way more broodish you are yes so I don't know
[01:17:45] vacuum harder you're vacuuming with more finesse you got to focus on the finesse part of it
[01:17:51] otherwise you're gonna be all big fast and strong the the and I I think I understand a question
[01:17:58] but here's the here's the tip that I'm been married forever but significantly long
[01:18:05] here's what I found out like a lot of stuff like as a guy you think like hey I'm not really
[01:18:12] gonna do that because like that's not important you know like you you have a set of things that
[01:18:17] you think are important and they're based on certain ways of thinking then the girls gonna have things
[01:18:21] she thinks is important and in my experience which I from what I understand is very common
[01:18:27] that the things that some girls think are important they can't really put their finger on it
[01:18:34] or why they feel important or whatever but they just do you know and the guy will be like hey that's
[01:18:39] an important you can't even explain why it's important therefore you know I win the whole importance
[01:18:44] significance argument right so at the end of the day they're not gonna do these things just little things
[01:18:50] you know show me that you care like these sensitive things things that go against being
[01:18:56] faster stronger more British but if you can keep in mind that little little things even if you
[01:19:03] don't think they're significant actually do make your romantic partner happy and if you can
[01:19:10] consistently maintain that regardless of how big fast or strong you get that will help
[01:19:17] he's gonna embrace your big bigness fastness and strongness take it from the end no cool
[01:19:24] next question in cooperation and negotiation is there a tell to know when you're breaking
[01:19:34] your personal code and compromising too much is it a gut check or is it gut check or logical
[01:19:42] this is a weird one there's a kind of a confusing question so I just kind of kind of
[01:19:47] answer it to the best of my ability well the the biggest thing I notice when I'm
[01:19:53] when I'm interacting with other people the biggest thing that I pay attention to
[01:19:58] is am I paying it am do I care about this particular thing because of me or because of it's
[01:20:08] gonna help the team and if you can get through that if you if you really just say to yourself hey
[01:20:16] am I doing this because I'm gonna help the team or am I doing this because it's good about me
[01:20:22] if you pay attention to those things I'm not saying that every time that you say hey you know
[01:20:27] what I need to take care of me a little bit because you you have to remember that you have your
[01:20:31] strategic goals too right but most of the time the success of the team is gonna help you strategic goals
[01:20:40] now so for me I'm my constant thing is hey why am I why why does this concern me does it concern
[01:20:47] me it's basically does this concern me because my ego or not and if it doesn't concern me because
[01:20:52] my ego then it concerns me because it's not gonna benefit the team so let's help the team so that's
[01:20:57] that's what I that's what I look at the most when I'm negotiating when I'm cooperating you know
[01:21:03] if if you and I were negotiating a deal right and I was gonna buy a car from you and I was like
[01:21:13] you know you want to sell it for me to for 10 grand and I want to get it for nine how much of it
[01:21:18] and you're like okay you know what jaco I got it on the lot for for 8800 can you give me
[01:21:27] $400 over the what I paid for it and give me 9200 or whatever and I'm like no
[01:21:35] how much of that is me just this is my ego I just want to mean the ego fight against you and how much of
[01:21:41] it is me like hey that's actually a pretty good deal and and why not take care of this guy because I don't
[01:21:46] know I don't really know you but hey man maybe we'll buy something else in the future maybe
[01:21:51] all you'll have you know what I mean so am I trying is is it my ego or is it just a bad deal if you're
[01:21:57] like hey nope it's 11000 and I'm like okay you know what I'm not gonna pay that so it's not it's not my
[01:22:02] ego that's just not a good deal at 10 grand it's not a great deal at 9200 it's a pretty damn good
[01:22:08] deal for me and it's you're gonna make some money and I'm happy that you're gonna make some money
[01:22:13] cool you know what let's say can so let's make a deal there's times where this is the so this is the point
[01:22:18] there's times where my ego I'll be like no I don't care I don't care if you're only gonna make 200
[01:22:25] bucks that's that's your problem you should have paid so much when in my heart I know like hey
[01:22:30] that's actually a good deal I'm getting a really good deal but my ego is not letting me have closed
[01:22:33] close it that can be a fact that can be a problem so when I'm negotiating with someone
[01:22:39] and it's not a good deal they're not gonna get me to do what they want me to do it's just not
[01:22:44] gonna happen if it's a fair deal hey we'll make it work it's not a fair deal it's gonna be problematic
[01:22:51] you don't want to present me with unfair deals because I will not be accepting them
[01:22:58] also does it seem like this moral question I guess you you kind of got to like be truthful
[01:23:05] to yourself like consciously too right because when you could you give it like how you say you
[01:23:08] gotta ask yourself is this is this good for me and my ego or is this good for the team like
[01:23:13] as far as me not compromising my you know who not compromising or my personal code or whatever
[01:23:19] yeah and there's values that I will not compromise right there's a values that I will not compromise
[01:23:24] would that I would think that that before a very specific reason you know you know how
[01:23:27] for some people they'll be like I'm just not like that but they don't really know why like hey
[01:23:31] well I don't know maybe because my dad told me that one time when we're fishing or whatever
[01:23:34] the so there's a difference is what I'm saying so but here's the thing and I say this
[01:23:40] this is what I'll do sometime I'll be like hey you know this is more important because of you
[01:23:46] know I don't know my hell oh you're rationalized yeah you know and yeah I'll essentially
[01:23:52] like twist the truth to myself to to kind of explain to myself again how important this is you know
[01:24:01] for the team you know one of the things if that's important there's other ways to do that
[01:24:06] so so to to your point that's what I'm saying when I'm thinking about decisions I'm asking
[01:24:12] myself hey is this my ego or is this oh my doing the right thing for the rope for the team yeah
[01:24:17] because there's that's what you should be checking on right if you're doing it for yourself
[01:24:22] most 99% of the time if you're doing something for yourself that hurts the team the long term
[01:24:26] is not going to be beneficial to you okay the long term is not going to be beneficial to you
[01:24:32] because you're doing something for yourself everybody sees that you don't think they see it
[01:24:37] but they see it yeah so you try and do things that are going to benefit the team and
[01:24:43] sometimes I'm 99% of the time when you do something that benefits the team you're going to benefit
[01:24:48] from it as well but you have to see the long game because sometimes the short game it's like
[01:24:53] oh no if I do this for the team that means I'm going to miss this this weekend and that
[01:24:56] sucks well guess what in the long term when you work this weekend and cover for the other guys
[01:25:02] it couldn't make it in for whatever reason you're going to have a better relationship with them
[01:25:06] and they're going to cover for you next time it's like it's long term it's going to be good
[01:25:08] yeah but you're worried about you and that's that's a problem playing the long game again
[01:25:14] yeah always gotta play that long game next question that's way to get your team get you team in
[01:25:21] okay best way to get your team to buy in to your vision let it be their vision let the vision
[01:25:28] come from them right and the more the vision comes from them the more the plan comes from them
[01:25:33] the more they buy into it the more you force the vision and force the plan down there's throw
[01:25:37] the less buy in that you're going to get from it now you if you're super persuasive you can do a
[01:25:44] better job of coming up with a vision but why do that why not say hey guys you know what
[01:25:50] we're going to put together the direction that this team is going give me some feedback give me
[01:25:55] some bullet points hit me now they all come back with bullet points you as someone together it's
[01:26:00] okay this is what we're going to do it boom everyone's on board that easy our plan yeah
[01:26:07] so much easier with our plan and you if you're scared of that and I think if all if I give the team
[01:26:13] the opportunity come up with a plan they're going to come up with a plan that sucks well how
[01:26:17] well did you train them if they come up with a plan that sucks you haven't trained them very well
[01:26:22] most of the time if you train them decently they're going to come up with a plan that's close enough
[01:26:25] to the decent plan that they can go and execute you we can all execute it together that can be
[01:26:28] part of the vision let's go hey juggle what would be better verbal communication with
[01:26:35] concept of prioritizing ex-y when talking to my wife she oftentimes feels overwhelmed with how many
[01:26:41] decisions she has to make she hates when I use the words of prioritizing ex-y cute well the root
[01:26:47] problem there isn't that she hates the the words prioritize next you the the problem is is that
[01:26:53] you're you're telling her what to do yes that's you know instead of being like hey you know
[01:27:00] hey if you just prioritize next you there's if there's a at least a 50% chance that she doesn't
[01:27:06] even want to hear your suggestion she's just telling you because it's vent she's venting to you
[01:27:11] so for you to be like man those are a lot of decisions make that's hard
[01:27:14] if you were to say to her how do you how do you handle this because I know you're doing this
[01:27:20] every day girl I'm impressed how do you do that and then she says well you know it's hard but
[01:27:25] here's what I do so if it was just a matter of re-naming it it's like hey well call it hey
[01:27:32] you know what you need to do is grade and go or what you what you need to do is rank and roll
[01:27:38] what you need to do is triage and check off what you need to do
[01:27:41] or or designate and do that's you know there's a bunch of different ways you could phrase it but
[01:27:46] that's not what's making her responded in a negative way it's responding in a negative way because
[01:27:51] you're saying hey here's all you need to do is prioritize next you right that's a snow
[01:27:57] what she needs is some sympathy some listening allowing to vent and then you can say hey
[01:28:06] you know if you've done that properly you can say well you know I did read that book and they
[01:28:11] kind of say when there's a bunch of crazy things going on like you've got going on they say to do
[01:28:16] the same thing that I see you do which is you pick the most important one and then you kind of
[01:28:20] focus on that that's pretty cool you do that pretty well yeah you do that really well
[01:28:28] so just take a little bit of approach man yeah it's not just the words the words are not
[01:28:32] important I hate to break the news to you but the words are not pissing her off you are
[01:28:37] listen to her it seems you don't notice some people they come you and a problem they don't
[01:28:42] want a solution oh yeah it happens all the time they just want you to sit there and listen to them yeah
[01:28:47] my wife does that for sure for sure you know hey there's this problem oh why don't you do this
[01:28:54] it's not that easy okay fine yeah you just tell me more about the problem I'm still here listen
[01:28:59] don't say that by the way you're going to do that that part yeah yeah yeah yeah it's almost like
[01:29:06] when it is like it seems like they yeah that they don't mind so much the suffering of the problem
[01:29:12] suffering I'm over using that word I know but like they don't mind the suffering they just want
[01:29:16] to they don't want to suffer alone so if like oh yeah I'm having like these issues or whatever
[01:29:21] first is like hey come suffer with me sympathize empathize or whatever we can suffer together
[01:29:27] that that's that's why I'm coming to you in the first place so I can get closer to you whatever whatever
[01:29:31] I don't know that I'm totally reflecting diminished do you remember when I talked about that
[01:29:35] yes that's like a such a good tactic in this situation reflect the emotions back to them
[01:29:41] but diminish them a little bit so if they're all freaking mad about something you go oh I can't believe that
[01:29:48] but you don't be as mad as them but you don't be the hate calm down you don't you don't say yeah
[01:29:52] hey here's just just prioritize next cue oh it's a rough one actually to be honest like
[01:29:59] I felt that before where I'd come to my brothers typically the one like I've come to him with
[01:30:05] like a problem and here's the thing I didn't want like sympathy or empathy primarily but I
[01:30:10] wanted a little bit you know so you can't just roll sit there with your
[01:30:15] apple or whatever okay I think what you're gonna do is put this you know like kind of like
[01:30:20] you're so done it you get this feeling I'm not saying this you want to know why
[01:30:26] your brother or you or whoever can look at that problem and like come up with a solution
[01:30:30] it's because they're detached they're de facto detached from the problem so when you're all wrapped up in the
[01:30:35] problem you're like a head or no way to do because I got this this and this your brother's like
[01:30:37] well just do that and you're like you get mad you know well you're able to see what to do
[01:30:42] because he's on the outside yeah so if you can learn to too detach yourself you won't have to rely on
[01:30:47] getting other people to help you yeah if you can't detach and you're all wrapped up in the
[01:30:51] emotions the situation you're gonna you're gonna have to go someone to help and then when you do
[01:30:55] don't get mad at them when they just tell you the solution but but when you reverse the rules
[01:31:02] and you take ownership of trying to provide solutions you got to realize that it's your fault
[01:31:06] that your solution isn't being welcomed yeah and that's kind of the point where like I'm
[01:31:11] trying to gain an understanding you know because easy when your detachments first in his like
[01:31:16] why are you complaining about like because this is like you feel the front of your mind you're like
[01:31:19] why are you complaining about this why don't you just solve that problem and never complain about it ever again
[01:31:23] you know that's the feeling the other person have that detached person the you know in this case
[01:31:28] um the husband and whatever so what I did was I imagine my situation that I'm on the other side
[01:31:35] where I kind of like I know what it feels like to kind of want some sympathy I don't want sympathy and that's it
[01:31:40] you know but of course but I want some of it so imagine that feeling then or I imagine that feeling
[01:31:45] that I got from my brother at times when I come to him with a problem that that's bothering me or
[01:31:50] whatever and the part and the fact that it's bothering me means nothing all my end so the fact that
[01:31:56] the way he presents a solution with no empathy and sympathy almost says actually it feels like it says
[01:32:03] you're so dumb like you're dumb yeah you know like why you wrapped up about this thing you're
[01:32:08] dumb kind of thing so from a leadership perspective from his perspective he's your recognized
[01:32:12] that what he needs to do is massage your ears feel good about it be like oh man that's a hell of
[01:32:17] a problem you know one thing maybe you could do I don't know if you'd be up I don't know if I could do
[01:32:21] it but you could probably do it because you're a little bit better at this kind of thing you just
[01:32:24] don't just do that well that's a good tactic right there when you say like like what you what you
[01:32:30] kind of do kind of like you're like one of these individuals one of the rare people who knows how to
[01:32:35] deal with it and it's like with all right you know nothing that you do that I can't really do
[01:32:38] it though is you prioritize and that's it what you think of you I just get all scattered brain
[01:32:46] so focus on all kinds of different things at the same time and that's a problem yeah there you go
[01:32:51] get some next question my warrior kids want to know is where your kid number three in the works
[01:32:58] yes warrior kid three is in the works I am on chapter 10
[01:33:02] yeah and but unfortunately I've been on chapter 10 for a couple days not because it's taking
[01:33:07] me a long time to write chapter 10 but I didn't write yesterday or the day before
[01:33:13] because we were doing multiple podcasts which is a bummer but be back on the path today as a
[01:33:18] matter of fact well technically you're on the path your path is just super wide you know you
[01:33:23] had to switch lanes for a little bit you know miss you miss it exit but good you know boom you're
[01:33:27] back on on in that lane on the same path so yeah and we're looking at we're looking at spring
[01:33:32] publication for that once again getting it out there really haven't found right in this book that's
[01:33:38] the characters develop more complex some complex there's some complexities there's some situations
[01:33:43] that mark hasn't really had to deal with yet the primary being Danny Reinhart so brace yourself
[01:33:51] for the impact of Danny Reinhart brace yourself all right that's what you're life's hell is intense
[01:33:57] and intentional how do I even get started living like that let's just break this down real easy okay
[01:34:04] number one if you want to live like more focused in your life choose to decide that you're going
[01:34:11] to actually live like that do that right down whatever it is you want to do and then before you
[01:34:19] go to bed at night right down some things that you're gonna do tomorrow they're gonna help you move
[01:34:22] towards the goals that you have and then set your alarm clock for early in the morning wake up and
[01:34:28] do the things that you wrote down stay on that path that's it yeah and do you think that you've just
[01:34:36] sort of grown accustomed to just dealing with it that way so you know the more you do it yeah
[01:34:41] absolutely so that's kind of the hard part right to get off the ground should be saying to break
[01:34:46] the gravitational pull of laziness and apathy yes yeah and of course that but I feel like that
[01:34:54] in this kind of situation like when you live how intently intense sure but you kind of always
[01:35:00] being intense but that intentional situation because it's pretty easy if you know a goal it's pretty
[01:35:06] I don't say easy but it's simple like to reach that goal is really clear you know like
[01:35:11] you're gonna have to fight through obstacles all this other stuff but if you don't really have
[01:35:13] an intentional like goal it's hard to just kind of float there and be like I need to be I don't
[01:35:18] know vaguely success what's like it's it makes the whole deal harder and it's a lot of times like
[01:35:25] a normal person would they don't have specific goals for every aspect of their life you know they'll
[01:35:30] have one in maybe with their career something like that or fitness or something like that but
[01:35:34] everything else is just sort of hey I'm leaving day by day doing the best I can't kind of think
[01:35:38] but if you can whether be right it down or whatever if you can have it in your brain consciously
[01:35:42] that or remember essentially like what these goals are it makes it a lot more clear and then the
[01:35:48] more you kind of follow those goals the more it becomes like habit like you just what I think
[01:35:54] check next question how do the finest civilian leaders differ from the finest military leaders or
[01:36:01] in other words what character traits do military leaders develop that are more difficult
[01:36:07] or rare for civilian leaders to develop there really the leadership is leadership and the
[01:36:14] good civilian leaders have the same good qualities that the good military leaders have and vice
[01:36:18] versa and life life was talking about this the other day that you know he he tells people like
[01:36:25] hey man I wish you were in the military wish you you would have been good you know you would have been
[01:36:28] a good infantry officer you would be good sealed platoon leader that would have been cool if you were in
[01:36:32] teams because you're a good leader in the civilians after you're a good leader in the you'd be a
[01:36:36] good leader in the military so there's no and now there are strengths and weaknesses for leaders in
[01:36:42] both of those situations in military leaders you take 10 military leaders there's all kinds of
[01:36:48] strength and weaknesses different between all each one of those 10 and there's all kinds of
[01:36:52] you take 10 civilian leaders and all kinds of different strengths and weaknesses amongst those 10
[01:36:56] and if you put them if you flip them back and forth it doesn't matter there's still going to be
[01:37:00] random strengths and weaknesses some guys are good at presenting things some guys are good at
[01:37:03] simplifying things some guys are good at articulating things and and those groups washed out
[01:37:09] regardless there's great military leaders that aren't very articulate but they figure out who
[01:37:13] to get done there's great civilian leaders that aren't very articulate but they figure out what
[01:37:16] there's great military leaders that are really good at simplifying things there's great
[01:37:21] civilian leaders that are good at simplethere's people that are not good at that so they find
[01:37:24] the correct solution the people that'll compliment them as leaders and move forward
[01:37:28] But no huge difference.
[01:37:31] Actually, there's no difference.
[01:37:32] There's just, there's good leadership
[01:37:35] and there's bad leadership.
[01:37:36] That's it.
[01:37:37] Hey, Jockel, love your book, Sam Podcast.
[01:37:42] When it comes down to the wire,
[01:37:45] and you need to make a quick and tactical decision
[01:37:47] and admit, amidst chaos, how do you keep your head straight?
[01:37:50] This is just everyone knows the answer
[01:37:52] to this by now, detach.
[01:37:53] Take a step back, take a step back offline,
[01:37:55] take a step back from the tactical situation
[01:37:57] and turn your head, look around, see what's going on,
[01:38:00] assess it properly, unemotionally,
[01:38:02] and then make a decision.
[01:38:03] That's it.
[01:38:04] You gotta learn to detach.
[01:38:08] Easy money.
[01:38:09] Next question.
[01:38:10] Jockel, it's not easy.
[01:38:11] It was easy.
[01:38:12] People would ask me that question.
[01:38:13] Two months ago, it's a simple, not easy.
[01:38:15] It is simple, it is simple, but it's definitely not easy.
[01:38:18] No, it's not, and I'll tell you,
[01:38:20] it's not only not easy, it's almost so hard
[01:38:24] that you don't even see it happening.
[01:38:27] It's like you're blind to it.
[01:38:29] Most people are blind to it.
[01:38:30] That's why it's such a huge advantage
[01:38:32] from a leadership perspective.
[01:38:33] You can be one inch above everyone else.
[01:38:37] You can see infinitely further than they can,
[01:38:40] because let's face it.
[01:38:42] They have a limited, when you're at one level,
[01:38:46] when you're at six feet, you can see what you can see.
[01:38:51] You go to eight feet, you can see things
[01:38:53] that they can't see.
[01:38:55] They literally can't see them.
[01:38:57] So therefore, you know things that they don't know.
[01:39:00] And all of a sudden, you seem brilliant,
[01:39:02] because you can literally see things
[01:39:03] that they literally can't see.
[01:39:05] So take a step back, turn your head,
[01:39:07] look around, detach from your emotions,
[01:39:10] detach from the chaos, that's it.
[01:39:12] And the emotions, that's like one of the major things
[01:39:17] that's making you blind.
[01:39:19] The first one?
[01:39:21] Yeah, whether it's emotions,
[01:39:22] whether it's anger, whether it's frustration,
[01:39:25] whether it's panic, whether it's stress,
[01:39:29] all those emotions will have the same result
[01:39:31] on you and your decision making,
[01:39:33] which is you won't see what's actually happening.
[01:39:37] Jalko, how do you build a relationship
[01:39:40] with a boss that consistently loses his temper
[01:39:44] on a regular basis?
[01:39:46] Stay calm, don't overreact, let them vent to you.
[01:39:50] And don't make a big deal out of them losing their temper.
[01:39:55] Just be like, just absorb it and be like,
[01:39:57] hey, it's all good boss, let them vent.
[01:40:01] And then when they calm down a little bit,
[01:40:03] just don't even go like, man, I'm glad you calm down.
[01:40:06] No, just be like, you know, say,
[01:40:08] okay, hey, here's where we're at with this decision.
[01:40:11] I'm gonna bring this to the troops or whatever,
[01:40:13] just be calm.
[01:40:14] And then eventually, hopefully,
[01:40:17] you get a relationship that's strong enough
[01:40:18] so you can actually say something to them, like,
[01:40:21] hey, man, you know, I know you,
[01:40:23] I know things drive you crazy, but, you know,
[01:40:25] it's always a lot better when you're just kind of calm.
[01:40:29] And everyone kind of has a lot of respect for that, you know?
[01:40:32] But again, that's when you gotta be careful with
[01:40:34] because they might just go, what are you talking about?
[01:40:35] You don't know about respect, they might have to say.
[01:40:37] They might have to say, right there.
[01:40:39] So yeah, I'm just gonna be calm, not overreact,
[01:40:41] absorb that kind of thing.
[01:40:44] Next question.
[01:40:46] I'm struggling to be an effective leader
[01:40:47] because I'm told that I don't have the right tone.
[01:40:52] I'm too direct in course.
[01:40:54] And I'm not too sure how to fix it.
[01:40:56] I'd appreciate any of it.
[01:40:57] And all help, thanks a lot.
[01:40:58] If you can record yourself while you're talking to people,
[01:41:02] like when you're on the phone with someone,
[01:41:03] just record to take out your cell phone and record
[01:41:08] and see what you sound like.
[01:41:09] Because you might be surprised at what you sound like.
[01:41:11] A lot of times people don't realize what they sound like.
[01:41:14] You might have to overcompensate for a little while
[01:41:17] and be overly pleasant and nice to people,
[01:41:19] which to them might sound like normal,
[01:41:22] but to you, it'll sound like you're being just totally
[01:41:25] over the top nice because you're like, how are you today?
[01:41:31] And they're thinking, oh, that's nice.
[01:41:32] These actually have an accommodation with me.
[01:41:34] And in your mind, you're like,
[01:41:35] these are just pleasant trees.
[01:41:36] I don't think I should be, you know, it's like, no,
[01:41:38] just calm down.
[01:41:39] It's actually great feedback.
[01:41:40] It's awesome that people have actually told you
[01:41:43] that you are too direct and too course.
[01:41:46] So what does that mean?
[01:41:46] You're offending people.
[01:41:48] If you're offending people, do they listen to you?
[01:41:49] The answer is no.
[01:41:50] So how do you not offend people?
[01:41:52] And in your mind, you're thinking,
[01:41:54] hey, this is the way I am.
[01:41:56] You know, I'll just want to these people that's direct.
[01:41:58] You don't, you know, I just put the word out.
[01:42:00] And it's like, no, actually all you do is piss people off
[01:42:02] offend them and now they don't listen to you.
[01:42:04] So don't be that person.
[01:42:06] Let's try and build relationships.
[01:42:07] Make that your key goal, make your goal,
[01:42:09] not to get the your point across to them,
[01:42:11] but to build a relationship with them.
[01:42:13] Make that your goal.
[01:42:14] And then the rest of it will start to come together.
[01:42:17] Get you moving in the right direction.
[01:42:18] Yeah.
[01:42:19] And sometimes,
[01:42:22] do not say this person is like this,
[01:42:24] but sometimes people who are direct and course
[01:42:27] like they sort of take pride in it,
[01:42:29] and also, so if you can search your mind and be like,
[01:42:33] hey, am I taking pride in this a little bit?
[01:42:35] Know that you're going full speed in the wrong direction.
[01:42:39] That's right.
[01:42:39] With that, you know, if that's the case,
[01:42:42] that makes you a lot easier.
[01:42:43] Here you go. Yep.
[01:42:45] Affirmative.
[01:42:45] Next question.
[01:42:47] I serve in the Coast Guard and operate in high risk
[01:42:50] surface operations where not only do I have victims
[01:42:54] in the water who gave a high risk,
[01:42:56] who have a high risk of dying,
[01:42:58] but also my people and myself have a high
[01:43:00] probabilities of being injured or killed.
[01:43:03] I enjoy my job thoroughly and perform on the job,
[01:43:05] but it's the waiting that's brutal.
[01:43:08] How do you manage stress, it stress in the off time.
[01:43:12] So it's not overwhelming.
[01:43:14] Look, you've got a train hard,
[01:43:16] you've got to be prepared, you've got to rehearse,
[01:43:17] you've got to drill worst case scenarios,
[01:43:18] you've got to be an awesome physical condition,
[01:43:21] you've got to do all those things.
[01:43:24] You prepare as much as you can.
[01:43:27] You can't worry about things that you can't control.
[01:43:29] So the things that you can't control,
[01:43:31] what can you control?
[01:43:31] You can be in good physical shape,
[01:43:33] you can prepare for your equipment,
[01:43:35] make sure you know how to operate your equipment,
[01:43:36] you can drill worst case scenarios,
[01:43:38] so make sure your team understands the procedures
[01:43:40] that you're supposed to do.
[01:43:41] So you take control of all the things
[01:43:43] that you can control, you do those to the end degree,
[01:43:47] the things that you can't control,
[01:43:49] you just gotta not worry about them
[01:43:51] because that's what's,
[01:43:53] you're actually less prepared
[01:43:55] because you're worrying about other things.
[01:43:57] You can't sleep because there's a storm coming
[01:43:58] and you know that there's gonna be some rescues.
[01:44:00] It's like, hey, you've prepared, you've trained,
[01:44:02] you've got your equipment already,
[01:44:03] you've rehearsed with your teammates,
[01:44:05] like that's what we do.
[01:44:07] And there's some things that I can't control,
[01:44:09] and I'm okay with that.
[01:44:11] And not to get too crazy, but like worst case scenario,
[01:44:16] and not to get too like dark worst case scenario,
[01:44:19] what happens?
[01:44:21] Worst case scenario, what happens?
[01:44:23] You die.
[01:44:25] That's the worst case scenario that happens.
[01:44:28] Okay.
[01:44:31] Okay, so you've got your insurance taken care of,
[01:44:35] you've got your SGLI set up,
[01:44:38] you've written letters to your family
[01:44:41] to tell them what to do,
[01:44:44] and that you've had a great job
[01:44:45] and that you loved what you're doing, what you're doing,
[01:44:47] and that's the way it goes.
[01:44:51] You know, part of life is death, 100%.
[01:44:56] Think about that, 100%.
[01:44:58] So if you can compartmentalize the things that you can control
[01:45:05] and say, okay, these are things I've got control of,
[01:45:06] and then you look at the worst case scenario,
[01:45:08] which is the worst case scenario,
[01:45:09] I mean, I guess the worst case scenario is like,
[01:45:11] hey, if you could one of your teammates,
[01:45:14] you know, dies, that seems to me to always be the worst thing,
[01:45:18] or you die.
[01:45:19] What are you gonna do?
[01:45:20] So to prevent my teammate from dying,
[01:45:23] I'm gonna train, prepare, do everything I can to my power,
[01:45:27] and one of the things in my power to do
[01:45:29] is to not be scared of things that I can't control,
[01:45:31] or not worry about things that I can't control.
[01:45:33] And then like, hey, I could die doing this job.
[01:45:39] That could happen.
[01:45:42] What do you do about that?
[01:45:43] You prepare for it.
[01:45:44] You write your will, you make sure that,
[01:45:47] your W, your W2, or page two,
[01:45:49] I believe it's called your page two,
[01:45:50] and the military service records,
[01:45:52] so that they know what to do with your finances.
[01:45:54] You fill out your SGLI form,
[01:45:57] you write a letter to your friends and family.
[01:46:01] That's what you do.
[01:46:02] And then you go out and you do your job.
[01:46:05] The fear, the fear of death
[01:46:12] that you have in your mind is more likely to cause a problem.
[01:46:16] If you're afraid of death, you're more likely to die,
[01:46:19] than if you say, you know what, if this happens,
[01:46:22] God forbid, guess what?
[01:46:24] I'm living the life I wanna live,
[01:46:27] and I'm gonna die doing this.
[01:46:29] It's like that, if you can get over that hurdle right there,
[01:46:33] that's a huge thing.
[01:46:35] And the more comfortable you are with that,
[01:46:38] the less chance of you actually dying,
[01:46:40] there is because you won't be scared of it.
[01:46:42] You won't be hesitant, you won't be paranoid,
[01:46:44] you won't lose sleep, you'll be like, okay.
[01:46:47] So just truly think about it.
[01:46:50] Like, man, you're doing an important job,
[01:46:53] you're gonna try and save people's lives,
[01:46:55] there's inherent risk in that,
[01:46:56] but it's what you wanna do, is what you chose to do,
[01:46:59] there's, you deal with that.
[01:47:01] And if you can get through that, that's a huge step.
[01:47:05] Does this mean you wanna die?
[01:47:06] No, it doesn't mean that at all.
[01:47:07] It doesn't mean that at all.
[01:47:09] It doesn't mean that at all.
[01:47:11] But if you're like, you know what, I could die.
[01:47:14] That's one of the possible outcomes here.
[01:47:15] It's highly unlikely, but it is a possible outcome.
[01:47:19] If it happens, I've lived the best possible way I can.
[01:47:24] I've prepared for my family, friends,
[01:47:27] to be taken care of to understand what happened,
[01:47:29] and I'm okay with that.
[01:47:32] That's my recommendation.
[01:47:37] Makes sense.
[01:47:41] Jocca, I'm very goal oriented.
[01:47:45] I'm very goal oriented.
[01:47:46] My friends say that they want me to achieve this
[01:47:49] and that yet they still are vaping,
[01:47:51] parting, being lazy and overall don't walk the talk.
[01:47:54] I wanna be an AF special tactics.
[01:47:58] Air Force.
[01:47:59] Air Force special tactics officer,
[01:48:01] and I don't have time for those destruction.
[01:48:04] How do I get to Monttrak?
[01:48:05] Well, this is pretty straightforward one for me.
[01:48:08] What I do is I walk the walk and keep walking.
[01:48:15] And if these guys want to walk the walk with me, cool.
[01:48:18] But if they want to vape and party and be lazy,
[01:48:22] those aren't the kind of guys you want around
[01:48:25] with your team anyways.
[01:48:28] So unless they get on the path that leads to the right place,
[01:48:32] I mean, you can tell them, hey man,
[01:48:34] this isn't gonna get you there, but don't spend a bunch
[01:48:37] of time trying to pick up and drag people
[01:48:39] that don't wanna drag themselves.
[01:48:40] Not that you go into an organization
[01:48:42] like a special tactics in the Air Force.
[01:48:45] You don't wanna be caring other people.
[01:48:46] You don't have to motivate other people.
[01:48:49] You want people that wanna do the job themselves.
[01:48:53] So don't spend a bunch of time with these people
[01:48:56] that don't wanna get after it.
[01:49:01] Makes sense.
[01:49:03] Jockel, when things start moving fast
[01:49:05] and feel out of control because you're really getting after it.
[01:49:08] Work, family, duty to encounter this other things.
[01:49:11] How do you slow it down and get the feeling back
[01:49:16] of being in control?
[01:49:17] What you do in this situation is go harder.
[01:49:20] You go harder.
[01:49:21] What you do is, and this is, think of it like this.
[01:49:23] Think of it as a sprint.
[01:49:24] You get in bogged down, there's a bunch of stuff going on.
[01:49:27] Grab a hold of a bunch of them and sprint and get caught up.
[01:49:31] That's what you do.
[01:49:32] You sprint, you get caught up.
[01:49:36] I do that kind of right now.
[01:49:38] And I didn't start doing that.
[01:49:40] I really started having to do these little sprints
[01:49:42] that I do sometimes now.
[01:49:44] Like maybe a year ago.
[01:49:46] Where I just have to just buckle down for three days
[01:49:50] and do nothing but work.
[01:49:52] Just that's it.
[01:49:53] Nothing but work.
[01:49:55] I mean, the middle of one right now,
[01:49:58] just what I did over the last few days
[01:50:00] is like, like, work, work and more work.
[01:50:03] So it's a sprint.
[01:50:05] But then you get caught up, you get things under control.
[01:50:08] And then you can go back to a more sustainable pace
[01:50:11] because you can't sprint forever.
[01:50:12] Mm. You cannot sprint forever,
[01:50:15] factually, right?
[01:50:17] That doesn't work.
[01:50:18] So if you think you're going to run along side of vehicle
[01:50:24] because you can sprint, that's not going to work.
[01:50:26] Eventually the vehicle's going to outpace you
[01:50:27] and you're going to be left behind.
[01:50:29] So you have to choose a race that you can win.
[01:50:32] But sometimes, just like in a running race,
[01:50:36] you've got a sprint to get ahead.
[01:50:39] And then once you get ahead, you can, you know,
[01:50:41] you can fall, you can go back to a sustainable pace.
[01:50:45] But that's, that's what I do.
[01:50:46] I go into like a little period of mass production.
[01:50:49] I prefer slow and steady.
[01:50:52] Absolutely.
[01:50:53] I prefer just to keep on the disciplined path
[01:50:57] every day doing what needs to be done.
[01:51:00] You know, that we talked about plant and a tree earlier.
[01:51:04] Like writing a book, nothing feels better,
[01:51:06] writing a book than when you look up
[01:51:08] after a month of writing and you got 30,000 words.
[01:51:12] Because you go to 1,000 words a day.
[01:51:14] To sit down and write 30,000 words is a gut chest.
[01:51:19] It's a gut check.
[01:51:20] For me, it is.
[01:51:21] Because I don't enjoy doing that for long periods of time.
[01:51:26] I don't enjoy sitting there typing
[01:51:28] because the boards are already pretty much in my head.
[01:51:30] So it's just a manual labor.
[01:51:33] But it's not manual labor where you get to move rocks.
[01:51:35] It's a manual labor of pecking into a keyboard.
[01:51:38] That's not fun for me.
[01:51:39] There's no, there's zero physical benefit.
[01:51:43] But to look up after a month and say,
[01:51:46] I got 30,000 words.
[01:51:47] That's almost a book, right?
[01:51:50] So I prefer to do that.
[01:51:53] But sometimes because I've saddleed myself
[01:51:58] with many different things going on right now,
[01:52:01] sometimes I get behind and I have to sprint.
[01:52:04] I have to just say, okay, you know what?
[01:52:05] This is gonna suck for three days,
[01:52:07] but I'm gonna get back on track.
[01:52:09] And here we go.
[01:52:10] So that's what I do.
[01:52:11] When I start feeling like all the things
[01:52:12] are kind of getting hang of me,
[01:52:13] like, hey man, maybe you have to,
[01:52:16] for work, you have to sacrifice
[01:52:17] your jitsu for whatever, two days.
[01:52:21] You're like, yep, I'm not gonna train.
[01:52:22] But that's gonna save me a total of five hours
[01:52:25] in the next couple days and I can get a lot of work
[01:52:27] done in five hours.
[01:52:28] I didn't do jitsu yesterday.
[01:52:32] Did I want to?
[01:52:33] Yes, I did.
[01:52:35] But I said, okay, I'm gonna sprint right now.
[01:52:37] I gotta get this other stuff done
[01:52:39] and I had to prioritize.
[01:52:40] So that's what you have to do.
[01:52:42] And guess what, you know, then you could
[01:52:44] through that sprint, I can go back to your sustainable thing,
[01:52:46] which is jitsu every day.
[01:52:47] Just work out every day, which is,
[01:52:49] you know, write your right every day,
[01:52:51] do your work every day.
[01:52:53] So try that, try just buckling out,
[01:52:55] tell your family, tell your jitsu instructor,
[01:53:00] be like, hey, listen, I'm gonna be gone for three days.
[01:53:02] I gotta get caught up.
[01:53:05] So stand by.
[01:53:06] And boom, tell your family, look, hey,
[01:53:09] I'm sorry for the next three days.
[01:53:12] You're not gonna hear much from me.
[01:53:13] As I always stay at work late,
[01:53:14] I'm gonna get a bunch of stuff done and just sprint hard
[01:53:17] and give them a little reward at the end.
[01:53:18] Hey, when I get back on Tuesday or when I get back on the
[01:53:20] Friday, we're gonna go out for dinner, we're gonna have a
[01:53:22] good time.
[01:53:23] But I gotta sprint, gotta get caught up.
[01:53:24] So there you go.
[01:53:26] That's the much of procedure.
[01:53:27] Good little tactic.
[01:53:28] Yeah, it is a good tactic.
[01:53:29] Oh, little reward, do you like that?
[01:53:31] Well, the whole deal, both of them
[01:53:33] like basically to make sure that you communicate
[01:53:35] with all these people that might be affected by your thing.
[01:53:38] Even like in small ways, like I say, hey, I'm gonna sprint
[01:53:40] right now, you'd be, oh, I'm sometimes surprised
[01:53:44] and how that just that little thing is so effective.
[01:53:48] Like, you know, I don't know, I'm gonna go to Jesus too.
[01:53:51] At, you know, a weird different time
[01:53:53] that may be my family sort of depending on me,
[01:53:55] not in a big way, but just a little bit
[01:53:57] depending on me being there.
[01:53:58] And I'm gonna go to Jesus instead.
[01:54:00] If I say, one week before I do that,
[01:54:02] I have to say, hey, on this day, you know, like,
[01:54:05] I understand, hey, usually I'm here, I dig it,
[01:54:08] but I'm gonna go this day, this training just kind of
[01:54:10] means a lot to me this day and time, whatever.
[01:54:12] A week before.
[01:54:13] Heads up, they love it.
[01:54:14] Love night and day.
[01:54:16] Try do it the hour before versus the week before night and day.
[01:54:20] One situation is like, yes, oh, we got your back.
[01:54:23] We'll do it.
[01:54:24] And the other one is like,
[01:54:26] yeah,
[01:54:26] distinct.
[01:54:27] Guess what my wife thinks.
[01:54:30] She thinks I'm going to do it to every day and I am.
[01:54:32] Yeah, but just like so.
[01:54:34] I'm just trying to surprise him to her.
[01:54:36] If I'm ever like, oh, you know,
[01:54:38] she'll be like, oh, what?
[01:54:39] You didn't leave yet?
[01:54:40] Yeah, I'm like, no, I'm actually working.
[01:54:42] She'll be like, oh, okay, that's what she realized.
[01:54:44] I got some work to do.
[01:54:46] Man, that's a good, that's good.
[01:54:48] To remember it, you know, because you,
[01:54:50] it's easy to get caught up in like, hey,
[01:54:51] this is me and my sprint.
[01:54:53] I'm the one gonna have to buckle down, you know,
[01:54:56] sort of thing.
[01:54:56] So it kind of maybe gets in the way of you thinking,
[01:54:59] like, hey, it's for other people too, you know,
[01:55:01] I'm saying, and then that, that additional one words,
[01:55:04] like, yeah, when I'm done, you got another reward.
[01:55:06] Cause then if you communicate, they don't need the reward.
[01:55:08] I mean, you know, depends on who it is,
[01:55:10] but typically it would, it would make sense for them
[01:55:13] not to need the reward because we're all good.
[01:55:15] Good words scenario.
[01:55:16] You think, don't do it too much.
[01:55:19] They expect it.
[01:55:20] But that's a good to, I think.
[01:55:22] That's good.
[01:55:23] I'm gonna put down into rotation.
[01:55:25] Next question, hey, Jocco,
[01:55:27] a lot of respect for you in your work.
[01:55:28] I have a question.
[01:55:29] How do you draw the line between doing things
[01:55:32] you're uncomfortable with to develop
[01:55:36] and just torturing yourself unnecessarily?
[01:55:39] It's pretty straightforward question, actually.
[01:55:41] And a pretty straightforward answer.
[01:55:43] Does it benefit you or not?
[01:55:46] Does it benefit you?
[01:55:47] And there is some level of torture that benefits you
[01:55:51] because it just keeps you mentally and physically tougher.
[01:55:55] So there is benefit to some level of torture, right?
[01:56:01] There's also a level of torture that is not beneficial
[01:56:05] for you actually it takes you backwards.
[01:56:07] And it's gonna injure you, it's gonna break you down.
[01:56:10] It's gonna break you down mentally,
[01:56:11] it's gonna break you down physically.
[01:56:13] There's times, like I've talked about this,
[01:56:14] like there's times when I've gotten on a plane,
[01:56:16] where I get on a plane, this is when I know
[01:56:18] I'm just done training, which is I get on a plane
[01:56:21] and I, because normally on a plane,
[01:56:22] I can like really hammer out some work.
[01:56:25] I can get a podcast, I can read a book,
[01:56:27] I can just really go hard because there's no,
[01:56:29] I don't sign up for Wi-Fi on the planes, I just do work.
[01:56:34] And when I get on a plane and I'm just like,
[01:56:37] oh, I'm gonna watch him, I'm gonna go into this thing
[01:56:41] and watch, and remember the last time I did
[01:56:43] I watched Zoolander, which is a funny movie,
[01:56:47] but there's zero positive benefit to my humanity
[01:56:51] by watching Zoolander.
[01:56:53] But that's it.
[01:56:56] So I just like, okay, mentally,
[01:56:59] just need to damn break.
[01:57:01] You know?
[01:57:02] And same thing with physical,
[01:57:04] like there's times where you're physically,
[01:57:06] like there's times, this is an interesting one.
[01:57:09] When you're training, you get to,
[01:57:11] if I have an injury that's recovering,
[01:57:14] and let's say normally I do eight rounds, 10 rounds.
[01:57:18] When I have an injury that's recovering,
[01:57:20] I have to have the discipline to say,
[01:57:23] you know what, I'm only doing four rounds today,
[01:57:26] because when you get to the fifth, six round,
[01:57:29] I'm tired, I'm making mistakes, seven, day,
[01:57:32] through, now I'm actually gonna get injured again.
[01:57:35] So I wanna recover from the injury,
[01:57:37] so I take some, I have to have the discipline to say no.
[01:57:42] Because the lack of discipline says,
[01:57:44] I'm just gonna train more, I'm just gonna train harder.
[01:57:47] And sometimes you have to take a little
[01:57:49] little bit of a breather.
[01:57:50] And so if you're doing something,
[01:57:52] that's uncomfortable, but it's making you stronger,
[01:57:54] or smarter, or faster, yeah, that's good.
[01:57:57] If you're doing something that's uncomfortable,
[01:58:01] and it's not beneficial to you,
[01:58:03] then that's not smart to do,
[01:58:05] except for the occasional god check,
[01:58:07] which is how you're gonna suck.
[01:58:10] This is just gonna suck,
[01:58:11] and I'm gonna do it anyways.
[01:58:13] And that's fine.
[01:58:14] So, you're kinda different than people.
[01:58:21] The concept that you're talking about,
[01:58:23] I think, yeah, that's universal,
[01:58:25] which is good, like, you talk about,
[01:58:26] like, going on the plane, right?
[01:58:28] Even the way you're like, that has no good
[01:58:30] for humanity, you know, I know that was like a joking way,
[01:58:33] it's putting it, but the thing is that is good for you.
[01:58:37] And it's, what is, is it lander?
[01:58:39] Is it lander, whatever you watch,
[01:58:41] or something that's not work?
[01:58:43] Because it's like, you know, compared to a workout,
[01:58:45] Rob Jones does this a lot,
[01:58:46] he'll compare it to like lifting weights or workout.
[01:58:48] Which is good, I think, up near perfect analogy,
[01:58:52] the work you know, I think.
[01:58:53] It's essentially just your rest between sets.
[01:58:55] That's all it is.
[01:58:56] So if it's like, yeah, you don't get rest between sets.
[01:58:59] Oh, yeah, see how much weight you can lift in,
[01:59:01] probably not that much.
[01:59:03] But there's a difference between resting
[01:59:05] for like two minutes between your sets
[01:59:06] and then resting one day.
[01:59:08] Yeah, I agree.
[01:59:09] Sometimes though, sometimes you can say,
[01:59:13] oh, I need a rest, but you don't really do that.
[01:59:15] What I mean, yeah, you gotta be careful of that.
[01:59:18] Sometimes you gotta go, oh, this is just torture.
[01:59:19] So I don't wanna do it, but you really just being mentally weak.
[01:59:22] So you have to be aware.
[01:59:24] You have to do things that suck sometimes.
[01:59:26] Yeah, for sure.
[01:59:27] Some workouts just suck.
[01:59:29] Yeah.
[01:59:30] And they're awful.
[01:59:30] And they're torture, but they make you stronger.
[01:59:33] They make you better and they make you tougher.
[01:59:35] Yeah.
[01:59:36] So you do them.
[01:59:36] Yeah.
[01:59:37] So a perfect, and then if you want to do the workout,
[01:59:39] and analogy, where you're like, okay,
[01:59:41] so those two dichotomies, if you will.
[01:59:44] So it's like, okay, rest between sets, cool, I dig it.
[01:59:47] You do work, and then you rest between sets.
[01:59:50] That's the whole thing, right?
[01:59:51] Format.
[01:59:52] But you're like, okay, if I need two minutes of rest
[01:59:56] in between my sets for this specific workout
[01:59:58] for this specific outcome or results from the workout,
[02:00:01] then boom, that's what I'm gonna do.
[02:00:02] I'm gonna rest for two minutes.
[02:00:03] So there's difference between, in that case,
[02:00:05] there's a difference between resting two minutes
[02:00:07] and then resting 15 minutes.
[02:00:09] You don't need all that rest.
[02:00:11] Now you're just cruising.
[02:00:12] Now you're just avoiding the next set
[02:00:14] or putting it off or doing whatever.
[02:00:16] There's a difference.
[02:00:16] But on the other side, the more extreme
[02:00:19] the side of the spectrum, the workout can be like
[02:00:21] not two minutes rest.
[02:00:21] The workout, the whole workout could last two hours long.
[02:00:24] No rest between sets.
[02:00:25] That's the workout.
[02:00:26] But when the workout's done,
[02:00:28] you still gotta rest and recover from that workout.
[02:00:30] So just because you don't have a set amount of sets
[02:00:32] in your work day to day,
[02:00:35] still doesn't mean you need that rest
[02:00:36] between sets or the various rest between workouts.
[02:00:39] One thing that I got used to in the military
[02:00:40] and I see it in companies all the time,
[02:00:42] like I could work 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
[02:00:45] never stop and never get everything done.
[02:00:47] Yeah, that's something to think about.
[02:00:49] So then you have to save yourself,
[02:00:50] well, how productive am I gonna be
[02:00:52] and what's important and what's not important?
[02:00:53] And you gotta make sure that you get your right.
[02:00:55] If you take no rest,
[02:00:58] you won't be able to function properly.
[02:01:00] And for me, like I could write 24 hours a day
[02:01:04] and not write all the books I want to write.
[02:01:06] I could do Gigi Gigi 24 hours a day
[02:01:08] and not get as good as I want to get.
[02:01:09] I could work out 24 hours a day
[02:01:10] and not get as strong as I want to get.
[02:01:11] So you have to figure out how to balance
[02:01:12] all those different items together to figure out,
[02:01:15] like, okay, what is an acceptable level
[02:01:17] at each one of these components?
[02:01:19] Yeah, and it's gonna take kind of identifying the results
[02:01:22] that you want that are acceptable to you.
[02:01:25] So yeah, like a little witty called,
[02:01:27] there's the, like NASCAR, right?
[02:01:30] You're watching streets of thunder.
[02:01:32] I don't know, the long-time cruise.
[02:01:34] That is a NASCAR.
[02:01:35] There's something of thunder, days of thunder.
[02:01:38] Anyway, he's like racing and he's like,
[02:01:41] hey, you gotta do a pit stop.
[02:01:44] Everybody gotta do a pit stop.
[02:01:46] But it seems weird when you're like racing
[02:01:48] and you're like, hey, I'm ahead of everybody.
[02:01:50] I'm not gonna stop right now.
[02:01:51] I'm for word, you know, but,
[02:01:53] but, you know, your wheels are gonna fall off, right?
[02:01:55] So you gotta pit stop sometimes.
[02:01:57] Watch some Zulander, whatever.
[02:01:59] And then when you're done,
[02:02:00] you can be way more productive
[02:02:02] because those tires are new now.
[02:02:03] So they can fly around the track.
[02:02:05] Grip everything, seems same.
[02:02:08] Cooker.
[02:02:09] So that's part of the game.
[02:02:10] That's what I'm saying.
[02:02:11] Next question.
[02:02:12] How does the introduction you gave to Mike
[02:02:15] in the equipment room square with extreme ownership?
[02:02:18] No judgment, just trying to...
[02:02:19] Oh yeah, so Mike's a rally when Mike's really came
[02:02:21] into task in a bruiser because his other task
[02:02:25] had had some leadership issues
[02:02:28] and Mike was sort of the collateral damage
[02:02:31] in that whole thing.
[02:02:32] And so they moved him from that task
[02:02:34] in it which was task, unit Charlie,
[02:02:36] into task, unit bruiser.
[02:02:38] And when he came in, I brought him
[02:02:40] into the equipment room at Seal Team 3,
[02:02:41] which is where I would counsel my junior officers.
[02:02:44] Because there was the, there was construction going on.
[02:02:47] At Seal Team 3 at the time,
[02:02:48] there was no ceiling, so everyone could hear you
[02:02:50] in your office.
[02:02:52] And so I would go into this equipment room
[02:02:54] and brief guys if need be.
[02:02:56] And I just brought Mike's rally in there
[02:02:57] and I had a counseling letter for him to sign
[02:03:02] and it said there's no drama in task, unit bruiser.
[02:03:06] Don't bring any into it.
[02:03:08] And that's it.
[02:03:11] It was like really straightforward.
[02:03:12] I don't know, I'm not gonna ask him if he still has it.
[02:03:14] But I don't know why this person thinks
[02:03:16] that that doesn't square with the extreme ownership.
[02:03:19] This one as I'm concerned that is,
[02:03:20] I had a guy that was coming into a unit
[02:03:23] that had been together for seven or eight months,
[02:03:25] gone through work up and ready getting ready
[02:03:28] for deployment and I just had to take ownership
[02:03:30] of the fact that I had a guy that was showing up
[02:03:32] that I didn't know I did get feedback.
[02:03:36] I got feedback from multiple people, multiple sources.
[02:03:39] And my bro source was like, hey,
[02:03:43] Cernelly, he's fucking good to go.
[02:03:45] And I was like, okay, cool.
[02:03:46] So I knew he was good to go, but still,
[02:03:49] I wanted to set the expectation right for him
[02:03:52] so that he knew like, man, he might think that,
[02:03:55] that was his first task unit he was with.
[02:03:58] He might think this is the way it is.
[02:04:00] It's like, no, that's not the way it is.
[02:04:01] So for me, it was just, hey, we're just taking ownership.
[02:04:05] For me, it was, hey, I'm just gonna take ownership
[02:04:07] if this makes sure he knows what's going on.
[02:04:08] Make sure he understands the expectations.
[02:04:10] Make sure that we're not gonna have any drama in here
[02:04:12] because we don't have any drama.
[02:04:12] There's no drama.
[02:04:14] Like we have problems we solve.
[02:04:16] We don't backstab each other
[02:04:18] and tell on each other and stab each other in the back.
[02:04:20] No, we have a problem.
[02:04:21] We get together, we solve the problem.
[02:04:22] That's how it is.
[02:04:23] And so that's all.
[02:04:24] You don't know, I don't even think that's,
[02:04:26] I'm not even quite sure I'd have to get more details
[02:04:30] on this question to figure out why that didn't seem
[02:04:34] like the right thing to do for my perspective.
[02:04:37] It was, you know, it's great
[02:04:39] when you have somebody come on board and say,
[02:04:40] hey man, here's the expectations that are going on.
[02:04:43] Boom.
[02:04:44] Yeah, maybe because that was before he did anything.
[02:04:47] It's like he did something and then you were like,
[02:04:48] hey, you're bringing drama.
[02:04:50] Don't do that here.
[02:04:51] It wasn't that it was like, we don't have drama here.
[02:04:53] Don't bring it in here.
[02:04:54] Yeah.
[02:04:55] You know, with that?
[02:04:56] And Mike's really said, Roger that sir.
[02:04:58] Yeah, makes it.
[02:05:00] Yeah, of course.
[02:05:01] And you know how much drama you brought in?
[02:05:03] Zero.
[02:05:05] Yeah.
[02:05:06] So in a way, I mean, I don't know, looking at it from the outside.
[02:05:10] It seems like that was, you know, the essence of extreme
[02:05:14] ownership.
[02:05:15] You're using some anticipated problems.
[02:05:17] I'm going to do everything to mitigate
[02:05:18] whatever all these things.
[02:05:20] And I'm going to go a pre-empted problem solving mode
[02:05:24] tactfully.
[02:05:25] Yeah.
[02:05:25] And you're way, you know, the locker room.
[02:05:27] Yeah, I wasn't even like I was like, you better not.
[02:05:31] It didn't even accuse anything.
[02:05:32] You know, punty.
[02:05:33] I literally said there's no drama here.
[02:05:35] Yeah.
[02:05:36] Don't bring any.
[02:05:37] I didn't say like, you, we know, you know,
[02:05:39] I didn't get to point my finger.
[02:05:40] No.
[02:05:41] It was like, hey, man.
[02:05:43] Hey, cousin, my mind.
[02:05:45] I'm thinking, we know what I'm thinking of my mind.
[02:05:46] Hey, I got a prior and listed marine.
[02:05:49] That's going to be in my tasking it.
[02:05:51] I got another body.
[02:05:52] And he's an experienced guy.
[02:05:54] With, you know, yeah, I was totally stoked.
[02:05:58] Yeah, I was totally stoked, man.
[02:06:00] Yeah.
[02:06:00] So, no factor.
[02:06:02] No factor.
[02:06:02] All right.
[02:06:03] That's why I got time for one more, man.
[02:06:04] One more question.
[02:06:06] Sure.
[02:06:07] How do you stay on the war path when everything seems
[02:06:10] to be going wrong?
[02:06:13] Good question.
[02:06:14] You think that's a good question?
[02:06:15] Well, here's what I think is strange about that question.
[02:06:19] It's sort of like the question I had
[02:06:21] to answer about like sprinting.
[02:06:24] It's easy to, when things are going right,
[02:06:26] it's easy to stay on the war path.
[02:06:28] Right?
[02:06:29] You don't even need to be on the war path when things are going
[02:06:31] great.
[02:06:32] Because everything's happy.
[02:06:33] There's no war going on.
[02:06:35] You're at peace.
[02:06:36] People are delivering food to you.
[02:06:40] And you're getting a massage.
[02:06:42] There's no, you're not like, oh, I need to be on the war path
[02:06:44] right now.
[02:06:45] While I'm getting a back massage, while I'm getting food
[02:06:48] delivered to me.
[02:06:49] That's not happening.
[02:06:51] When the actual time that you need to go on the war path
[02:06:55] and you need to go harder on the war path
[02:06:57] is when things are going wrong, wrong.
[02:07:00] That's when you need to dig deeper.
[02:07:01] That's when you need to, that's when the whole idea of saying
[02:07:06] good.
[02:07:09] That's when it happens when things are actually
[02:07:11] when you're getting tested by the world.
[02:07:15] That's when you want to do it.
[02:07:16] So when you get tested by the world,
[02:07:18] that's when you get the opportunity to show the world
[02:07:20] what's your made of.
[02:07:25] That's when you get to say, bring it on.
[02:07:30] Bring it on.
[02:07:30] Oh, things are going wrong.
[02:07:31] Bring it on.
[02:07:32] I actually look forward to that.
[02:07:36] Because this is when I get to exercise my discipline.
[02:07:39] This is when I get to show the discipline.
[02:07:42] I get to put the discipline to work.
[02:07:44] It's the moment I have been waiting for.
[02:07:47] Because let's face it.
[02:07:50] If things were easy, then I could just sit around and slack off.
[02:07:55] Right?
[02:07:56] That's what happens.
[02:07:57] When things are easy, when things are going right,
[02:08:00] that's when you actually can slack off a little bit
[02:08:02] because things are going right.
[02:08:03] I don't recommend it.
[02:08:04] I recommend actually when things are going right,
[02:08:06] you go hard.
[02:08:07] But when things are going wrong,
[02:08:08] you need to go even harder.
[02:08:14] So if everything's going wrong,
[02:08:16] it doesn't matter to me because I'm on the path.
[02:08:23] I'm going to stay on the path on the war path.
[02:08:26] I'm going to get my situation rectified.
[02:08:29] Stat.
[02:08:32] Get some.
[02:08:35] All right.
[02:08:36] That's like two hours or something right now.
[02:08:39] So let's, I don't know, speaking of the war path.
[02:08:43] The path.
[02:08:44] Yes. Yes.
[02:08:45] How could we get people to, you know, how could we assist?
[02:08:50] With people being on the war step one,
[02:08:51] you do to that's in.
[02:08:53] That's right.
[02:08:54] Maybe that's step.
[02:08:55] Yeah, man, that's step one straight up.
[02:08:57] Made one make.
[02:08:58] Depends on where you are to begin.
[02:08:59] So let's face it.
[02:09:00] Anyway, so you need your, your key right.
[02:09:02] No need to ask anymore.
[02:09:04] Get an origin gate origin main.com 100%.
[02:09:07] 100% made in America.
[02:09:10] Yes, 100% good to get the gate and also 100%
[02:09:14] made in America.
[02:09:15] You made in America from the dirt to the githop straight up.
[02:09:21] Yeah, because it leads face it from the top soil to the githop.
[02:09:25] Top, so it tops little to the top of the githop.
[02:09:28] Yeah, fully.
[02:09:29] And for those who care about the aesthetics of the github,
[02:09:36] these aesthetics are, how should I say?
[02:09:40] Made specifically for you just to for sure.
[02:09:43] But I do do people.
[02:09:44] But you do do people?
[02:09:45] Yes.
[02:09:46] But they're like, they're cut.
[02:09:48] You know how they like, they're not like for G2.
[02:09:50] You can see them.
[02:09:51] And they look dope too.
[02:09:52] By the way, if you care about that, can stuff.
[02:09:55] Yeah, just a little bit.
[02:09:55] You want to make like you don't care.
[02:09:57] But you care.
[02:09:58] No, I am and always have been impressed by
[02:10:03] specifically dragon weave.
[02:10:05] Bigger.
[02:10:06] Come on.
[02:10:07] Yeah, I did.
[02:10:08] A dragon weave.
[02:10:09] You're not like a like, I still am impressed.
[02:10:12] It is.
[02:10:13] You know what I mean?
[02:10:14] Yeah.
[02:10:15] Have you seen the machine that they, that they figure out how to weave that thing?
[02:10:20] It's like a old.
[02:10:21] It's in pizza office.
[02:10:23] And it's like, it's, I'll have people to picture of it.
[02:10:27] But it's like, it looks like a mechanical thing from from 1898.
[02:10:34] I bet just from 1930.
[02:10:36] I bet you the thing is actually from 1930.
[02:10:38] Well, I have to ask Pete what year it is.
[02:10:40] But that's the actual thing.
[02:10:41] It's the old school thing that you figure out.
[02:10:44] You program is the work.
[02:10:46] But it's nothing.
[02:10:47] There's nothing digital about this.
[02:10:49] Program, what the fabric is going to look like from this machine.
[02:10:53] It's freaking, it's cool.
[02:10:55] Anyways, yeah.
[02:10:56] So that's a dragon weave.
[02:10:57] Also, rashguards.
[02:10:58] Also, 100% made in America.
[02:11:01] T-shirts, other things.
[02:11:04] Some cool stuff on that.
[02:11:06] Yeah.
[02:11:07] Supplements as well.
[02:11:08] Yeah.
[02:11:09] And supplements for your joints, a, for your being as a human.
[02:11:18] And for your operational capabilities.
[02:11:22] So join warfare for your joints, krill oil for your being, and joint.
[02:11:29] And joints, discipline for your operational capability.
[02:11:36] And lift your cognitive and your physical capabilities.
[02:11:42] And then, of course, we got that milk.
[02:11:45] So my additional protein for that.
[02:11:47] One.
[02:11:48] Had a big milkshake, put dark chocolate in it, by the way.
[02:11:51] You said that on the last podcast.
[02:11:53] Yeah, but you can put it in.
[02:11:54] Yes.
[02:11:55] And I put dark chocolate.
[02:11:56] Oh, dark chocolate.
[02:11:57] How outstanding.
[02:11:58] With what flavor, milk?
[02:11:59] Peanut butter chocolate.
[02:12:00] Is that your go-to?
[02:12:01] Currently it is.
[02:12:02] It was the main thing.
[02:12:03] It is for me too.
[02:12:04] Yeah.
[02:12:05] And it's all based on like how I feel.
[02:12:09] I'm just going to tell you, I probably have had peanut butter six times in a row, which
[02:12:17] it used to be not happening.
[02:12:19] It would be mint six times in a row.
[02:12:22] And then right now, I'm just so down with that peanut butter.
[02:12:25] Just down the foot.
[02:12:26] Yeah, on the peanut butter train.
[02:12:27] Situation.
[02:12:28] Yeah.
[02:12:29] But yeah.
[02:12:30] So these supplements overall, especially the joint ones, like, markets,
[02:12:33] it's like a kind of, just me alone with my thoughts.
[02:12:37] I'm like, this is kind of a glamorous one.
[02:12:38] The protein hell.
[02:12:40] Yeah, my muscles.
[02:12:41] Yeah.
[02:12:42] But the joint warfare, they don't get like the glamour.
[02:12:45] Here's what one of my buddies was telling me yesterday, one of my brethren, seals
[02:12:50] was using vanilla gorilla.
[02:12:53] And he's like, I'm putting it in everything.
[02:12:56] Yeah.
[02:12:57] Yeah.
[02:12:58] Yeah.
[02:12:59] Everything he makes is coffee.
[02:13:00] Yeah, yeah.
[02:13:01] I don't know.
[02:13:02] I don't know about tea, but his main thing was coffee.
[02:13:04] He's like, yeah.
[02:13:05] He's putting it in his coffee.
[02:13:06] Yeah.
[02:13:07] And he said it's like a sweetener.
[02:13:08] But obviously it's not bad for you.
[02:13:12] Yeah.
[02:13:13] It is sweetener because it makes a great thing.
[02:13:14] It makes a great thing.
[02:13:15] He was, you know when you talk to people and they get like the, the like, little, the
[02:13:20] little kid looking.
[02:13:21] Yeah.
[02:13:22] Yeah.
[02:13:23] He had that.
[02:13:24] I put the vanilla gorilla there.
[02:13:25] I could say he was getting fired up when he said he hit it with the blender.
[02:13:29] Yeah.
[02:13:32] So technically I do the same thing, but I put the coffee in.
[02:13:38] It's like a lower and a sprester, whatever, in the milk.
[02:13:41] Oh, yeah.
[02:13:42] So it's like a milkshake.
[02:13:43] It's like the same deal, but I'm sure the rest of the stuff.
[02:13:46] It's just a different thing.
[02:13:47] It's like coffee.
[02:13:48] It is.
[02:13:49] And that's the thing.
[02:13:50] So if you, like like coffee ice cream, you know, like that kind of stuff,
[02:13:54] where coffee ice cream and like black coffee, those are two different experiences for
[02:13:58] sure.
[02:13:59] Coffee ice cream, that's the delicious flavor when it's like delicious.
[02:14:03] So it's kind of the same deal with the milk.
[02:14:05] Speaking of delicious strawberry and chocolate or your kid milk for your children, I, this,
[02:14:14] this could get some kind of, you know, I'm not going to put myself in for a Nobel Peace
[02:14:19] Prize.
[02:14:20] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:14:31] But like, hey, we are helping the children of the world in a big way with strawberry and
[02:14:31] chocolate, where your kid milk.
[02:14:34] Because there's no other thing that you're just as a kid, as a kid, you're about that
[02:14:38] little Snickers bar hitter, right?
[02:14:40] You know, with these bad snacks and the kids.
[02:14:42] Yeah, bad snack.
[02:14:43] Yeah, hitters, right?
[02:14:44] Sure.
[02:14:45] You right?
[02:14:46] Yes.
[02:14:47] And then you're going to have a fun on that one because he understands hitters better
[02:14:51] than me.
[02:14:52] But if you can give your kid a strawberry or chocolate, milk, hitter, they're just good to go.
[02:14:58] So stoked.
[02:14:59] And they're going to get stronger.
[02:15:01] Yeah.
[02:15:02] Literally.
[02:15:03] Help you.
[02:15:04] I told Pete, I said, on the warrior kid podcast that warrior kid milk will make you
[02:15:08] stronger.
[02:15:09] He's like, I don't know if you can legally make that claim.
[02:15:13] I'm like, well, it's already been said.
[02:15:17] Yeah.
[02:15:18] And it's straight up.
[02:15:19] How can you, how can you not, how can that not be legally made because does protein
[02:15:23] rebuild your muscles?
[02:15:24] Yes.
[02:15:25] Answer.
[02:15:26] Yes.
[02:15:27] Does warrior kid milk have protein in it?
[02:15:28] Yes.
[02:15:29] I guess we got to get the kids to jack steel, too.
[02:15:33] Or just grow up as a kid, healthy.
[02:15:35] Yeah, you'll get stronger as a kid growing up.
[02:15:37] You don't have to jack in East.
[02:15:38] So we are technically and legally authorized to say to the children of the world warrior
[02:15:44] kid milk will make you stronger.
[02:15:47] If I get the Nobel Prize for that, you get Nobel Prize for helping children around the world.
[02:15:52] Yes.
[02:15:53] Then I deserve it.
[02:15:54] Yeah.
[02:15:55] All right.
[02:15:56] There you go.
[02:15:57] And enough to go too deep into the whole thing about getting stronger.
[02:16:02] Like if you make the claim that something's going to make you stronger, I think that
[02:16:05] is fine, like legally because legally you can't like diagnose.
[02:16:10] It wasn't with it.
[02:16:11] There's certain there's a list of things you can do.
[02:16:13] You can't diagnose.
[02:16:15] You can't.
[02:16:16] Oh, treat.
[02:16:17] You know, they're specific kind of, they're more medically based.
[02:16:21] I think.
[02:16:22] But I don't know.
[02:16:23] Well, the only thing that we really, the only claim that we make, which is scientifically
[02:16:27] proven, is the deadlift capabilities.
[02:16:31] If you drink, drop a white TSA 1000 pounds.
[02:16:33] It doesn't sound.
[02:16:34] Which I mean, obviously, no one's going to argue with that.
[02:16:37] No.
[02:16:38] No.
[02:16:39] Because that's just facts.
[02:16:41] So if you want some of the, if you want some, jocco white T because you need a bigger
[02:16:46] deadlift, which you probably do, then you can get that from Amazon.
[02:16:53] Well, the cans from Amazon.
[02:16:55] The cans from Amazon.
[02:16:56] The key you can get to everywhere.
[02:16:58] Everywhere meaning online, just go online, man.
[02:17:00] Okay.
[02:17:01] Jocco white T.
[02:17:02] It's on the store.
[02:17:03] Okay.
[02:17:04] There you go.
[02:17:05] On what store?
[02:17:06] Jocco store.
[02:17:07] It's called Jocco store.
[02:17:08] And the website is joccostore.com.
[02:17:11] It's online.
[02:17:12] Did you see the website for origin?
[02:17:14] Or the doc.
[02:17:15] Yeah.
[02:17:16] Oh yeah, for all this, the jocco, uh, joint warfare, moalk, the geese, the rash guy, the
[02:17:21] origin stuff is all that origin main.com.
[02:17:23] I did say it, but, you know, that's a little reminder.
[02:17:25] Yeah.
[02:17:26] But, jocco white T is everywhere, including joccostore.com.
[02:17:33] Also on joccostore.com is where you can get your shirts when you're representing on the
[02:17:37] path.
[02:17:38] See, and that's a big part of being on the path.
[02:17:40] Actually, that's a good psychological and physical.
[02:17:43] Yeah.
[02:17:44] Experience.
[02:17:45] I don't know.
[02:17:46] You're going to say, but I know what you're going to say.
[02:17:47] What?
[02:17:48] It helps you stand the path.
[02:17:49] Well, you're not going to eat a donut while you're wearing a discount because
[02:17:52] we're eating T shirt.
[02:17:53] Exactly.
[02:17:54] That's, that's, it's physically impossible.
[02:17:55] I think so.
[02:17:56] Yes.
[02:17:57] You'll be like, you'll, you'll be like the exercise.
[02:17:59] You just won't be able to stop yourself from throwing the donut box in the garbage
[02:18:03] can.
[02:18:04] You know, it's weird and being serious.
[02:18:06] It's like now.
[02:18:07] Let me see.
[02:18:08] No.
[02:18:09] Like, I can't eat a donut.
[02:18:12] Even if I'm by myself, like, I can't.
[02:18:15] It's embedded already because it's like a thousand of the path.
[02:18:20] It prevents me physically from eating the donut.
[02:18:23] The only donut I could eat is one that is an actual piece of steak cut into a circle
[02:18:28] with a piece missing from the middle.
[02:18:30] Yeah.
[02:18:31] I might do that.
[02:18:32] Maybe.
[02:18:33] I might be like, here's my dough.
[02:18:34] I can steak donut just to get some.
[02:18:36] Well, here's the thing though.
[02:18:37] There's such thing as like little protein donuts.
[02:18:40] Yeah, but if you look at the ingredients.
[02:18:42] I don't know.
[02:18:43] What if it was like a paleo protein or help you when people make paleo stuff?
[02:18:46] It's like kind of solid.
[02:18:47] Okay, why not shape it like a stick?
[02:18:50] Yeah, I know.
[02:18:51] Really?
[02:18:52] I think you have a point of it.
[02:18:53] I'm putting it into a donut.
[02:18:54] Yes.
[02:18:55] This scenario.
[02:18:56] Because I think that's it.
[02:18:57] I think that's the thing.
[02:18:58] It's like the fact that it's a donut kind of is that's what kind of creates the
[02:19:01] little thing in my brain.
[02:19:03] Anyway, anyway, back to the storage aqua store.
[02:19:07] Who's on there?
[02:19:08] Shirts on there.
[02:19:10] Hats on there.
[02:19:11] A lot of cool stuff on there.
[02:19:12] You want to represent?
[02:19:13] If you're going to represent in the wild, jocostor.com, grab something.
[02:19:17] Keep your on the deaf core path.
[02:19:23] Also, okay, we talked about jocqu IT.
[02:19:25] Obviously, also you want to subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already.
[02:19:29] That'll kind of keep you in tune.
[02:19:31] So to speak, seems obvious, I guess, but it'll seem like a small thing.
[02:19:36] But hey, it's good to subscribe.
[02:19:37] Staying tuned, staying touch on iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play.
[02:19:41] Anywhere where you listen to your podcast, go subscribe.
[02:19:44] Also, the where your kid podcast is the where your kid podcast better than jocqua
[02:19:50] podcast.
[02:19:51] I personally don't think so at the end of the day, what do you say?
[02:19:55] Net net.
[02:19:56] You ever heard that expression?
[02:19:58] Net net.
[02:19:59] My brother says it all the time.
[02:20:00] Anyway, net net.
[02:20:01] I like the jocqua podcast better.
[02:20:04] Here's a thing, though.
[02:20:05] It's not like just cut and dry.
[02:20:07] You know what?
[02:20:08] There's like legit competition.
[02:20:09] Yeah.
[02:20:10] There's a thing if you were to observe them from a completely unbiased.
[02:20:15] You probably don't like the where your kid podcast because you're not in it.
[02:20:18] I can't freaking rebuttal my stuff.
[02:20:21] Maybe here's it.
[02:20:22] Maybe.
[02:20:23] But here's here yourself.
[02:20:24] Here's the.
[02:20:25] No.
[02:20:26] No.
[02:20:27] Here's the part that kind of, what is it like, is like a rebuttal to my own opinion.
[02:20:33] Where could podcasts every single one of those was like 90.
[02:20:39] Like out to 85 to 100% impactful, like every little thing, like that felt like applied
[02:20:45] to me where I can like, whether it be an idea or talking about your daughter.
[02:20:48] No.
[02:20:49] You're not applied to you.
[02:20:51] To me, there's a human man.
[02:20:52] You're something.
[02:20:53] Something's yes.
[02:20:54] There are 16 years old or whatever you are.
[02:20:56] Yeah.
[02:20:57] Yes.
[02:20:58] But and I'm not saying it doesn't apply to my daughter.
[02:21:00] I'm not saying that.
[02:21:01] I'm saying it applies to me directly, whether it be me in my own life or me, how
[02:21:04] I'm going to deal with my daughter now or my son or whatever.
[02:21:07] Like all of the things pretty much like that's kind of the.
[02:21:11] So net net.
[02:21:12] Yeah.
[02:21:13] Jockel podcast sure I like better.
[02:21:15] Maybe because there's kind of more more thing.
[02:21:17] I don't know why, but that's my answer.
[02:21:20] But I will say this.
[02:21:21] Maybe this.
[02:21:22] Maybe maybe you might be right.
[02:21:26] But maybe because there's some, there's not as many where your kid maybe.
[02:21:31] Yeah.
[02:21:32] Maybe I need more.
[02:21:33] I need more to shift over to for that to be better.
[02:21:35] I don't know.
[02:21:36] Maybe.
[02:21:37] That's on iTunes, situ.
[02:21:38] Oh, yeah.
[02:21:39] That's on that's a podcast as well that you subscribe to also YouTube.
[02:21:43] The way you can do to well there's word.
[02:21:45] Yes, speaking of YouTube.
[02:21:47] There's the Jockel podcast channel on YouTube.
[02:21:50] There's Warrior Kid podcast on YouTube which we separated so that your child won't be
[02:21:55] watching Warrior Kid podcast and then all of a sudden have the rape of Dan King podcast creep
[02:22:00] into their zone.
[02:22:01] Right.
[02:22:02] So we separated them.
[02:22:03] And they're both up there.
[02:22:08] They're both available.
[02:22:10] And also on the Jockel podcast that's where Echo puts up videos with enhancements to them.
[02:22:14] Make them make the message more impactful in his opinion.
[02:22:19] Well, hopefully we'll say hopefully.
[02:22:24] Yeah, like I said though, the Mike in the Dragons video, which is move to the top slot
[02:22:30] in my opinion for your videos, which is a bold statement.
[02:22:35] Cool.
[02:22:36] Yeah.
[02:22:37] It's a bold statement.
[02:22:38] People have got tears in their eyes from a two minute video about a kids book.
[02:22:43] That's pretty impressive.
[02:22:44] Yeah.
[02:22:45] Well, I do have to say I even had tears in my eyes.
[02:22:48] Here's the thing that's I feel.
[02:22:50] And I'm not going to be like, oh, I'm going to, I don't think it's necessarily because
[02:22:54] of me making the video.
[02:22:56] Because like, well, I don't know.
[02:22:58] I'm only speaking for myself, where, okay.
[02:23:01] So the king died.
[02:23:03] This is a story within a story.
[02:23:04] It's a story of a story in a story.
[02:23:06] So there's like three layers there.
[02:23:07] But so the idea of the king dying and then the kid being like young and having this big
[02:23:13] responsibility, he'd done his shoulder and shoulders and him being scared for some reason.
[02:23:18] I don't know.
[02:23:19] I just get just like, oh, whatever about that.
[02:23:21] Oh, I don't know.
[02:23:22] Sensitive about that kind of stuff.
[02:23:24] So when it's like you explaining it and you say it, like you're not being off tough
[02:23:29] jockel, you know, it seems like you're doing it like appropriately.
[02:23:32] It seems same.
[02:23:33] And then so it's like that.
[02:23:34] That's really what kind of affected me.
[02:23:36] And I think sure I laid it out in a way where it's like kind of delivered in the appropriate
[02:23:40] way.
[02:23:41] But is it?
[02:23:42] Oh, I was going to ask if it was more impactful because you and I know the whole story.
[02:23:47] But people that don't know the whole story that didn't have the book yet were like, oh, my
[02:23:51] god.
[02:23:52] Yeah.
[02:23:53] Because you know the whole story.
[02:23:54] It's like, oh, that's cool.
[02:23:55] But then people that didn't know the whole story were just like, oh, you know what?
[02:23:59] Actually, no, no, the thing because Jade said the same thing and he didn't read the whole story.
[02:24:03] And he and he actually had little tears in his eyes.
[02:24:05] He's like, yeah, tears in my eyes.
[02:24:07] I don't know why I like trying to act like it's just so confusing.
[02:24:09] You know, but you know, he's all like being emotional.
[02:24:12] Yeah.
[02:24:13] Yeah.
[02:24:14] I saw what went on.
[02:24:15] So that's the YouTube channel.
[02:24:17] You can subscribe to that.
[02:24:18] That'd be cool.
[02:24:19] We appreciate it.
[02:24:20] And all that stuff.
[02:24:21] And leave the big thing about if you subscribe to the YouTube channel, you need to comment
[02:24:27] about echo because the only compensation that echo receives for participation in this podcast
[02:24:35] is being able to read YouTube comments that say echo is so jacked.
[02:24:42] Yeah.
[02:24:43] So go on YouTube, subscribe.
[02:24:46] And then right echo is yoked echo is jacked echo is looking massive all that kind of stuff
[02:24:53] because that way he'll be happy.
[02:24:55] I can just pay him with that.
[02:24:56] That's what you just paid with.
[02:24:57] Yeah, that's the worst idea I've ever heard.
[02:25:00] It's not that bad.
[02:25:01] Nonetheless.
[02:25:02] But you do like none.
[02:25:03] The less you pointed it out.
[02:25:05] Did you see that?
[02:25:06] Did you do it?
[02:25:07] Did you do it?
[02:25:08] When you were like, you were like, oh, there's always someone that says I look jacked.
[02:25:12] I never said that.
[02:25:13] But anyway, anyway, psychological warfare.
[02:25:17] Okay.
[02:25:18] If you don't know what that is, is what it is.
[02:25:20] It's an album with tracks.
[02:25:22] So on iTunes and Amazon Music and stuff, an album with tracks, Jocco saying, helping you
[02:25:27] us.
[02:25:28] It's helping us.
[02:25:29] That's what he's doing.
[02:25:30] Jocco is helping us through moments of weakness when they arise.
[02:25:34] And they're all right.
[02:25:35] You can't sprint forever.
[02:25:36] Good boy.
[02:25:38] And you might instead of taking appropriate action when you realize you can't sprint forever
[02:25:43] sometimes you might want to take a little bit more rest between sets.
[02:25:48] You don't have to.
[02:25:49] But to shoot it.
[02:25:50] I want to take too much rest.
[02:25:52] You might want to.
[02:25:53] Yes, exactly right.
[02:25:54] And you will not ever jack if you're taking situations between sets.
[02:25:59] So get psychological warfare.
[02:26:00] Yes, the documents Google Play and B3.
[02:26:03] Yes.
[02:26:04] Yes.
[02:26:05] And you'll get past those moments of weakness.
[02:26:07] Because Jocco will just help me through it.
[02:26:09] Just by telling you, that's the thing that's like a little spot.
[02:26:11] You know, when you're slack, you're a little spot in reference to weightlifting.
[02:26:16] Yeah, that's the thing.
[02:26:18] Right.
[02:26:19] Because you someone's trying to lift and they can't quite get it.
[02:26:21] And so they help you lift it a little bit.
[02:26:22] They give you a little spot.
[02:26:23] So you're referencing weightlifting.
[02:26:25] Yes.
[02:26:26] But in this case.
[02:26:27] That's how you get jacked.
[02:26:29] In this case, instead of weights, it's your slacker weakness.
[02:26:35] That might come.
[02:26:36] I'm not saying we're all weak, but sometimes some of us, a lot of us are sometimes.
[02:26:39] Anyway, Jocco's there for you, boom, psychological warfare.
[02:26:42] Also, if you work out boring, even if it's not boring, get more fitness gear.
[02:26:48] So I incorporated, okay, get it from on it on it.
[02:26:51] com slash jocco.
[02:26:53] Fitness gear, roll battle ropes, rings, kettlebells, of course.
[02:26:59] To me, if you don't have the kettlebells, I feel like there's like one little element.
[02:27:03] Big small, I don't know, depends on who you are, but there's one little element of
[02:27:06] life.
[02:27:07] That's missing.
[02:27:08] I'm not a big opinion.
[02:27:09] But when I got the rings, that changed my whole workout.
[02:27:13] So what I do, you know, you do a bunch of cool stuff on rings.
[02:27:18] I only do a handful of things.
[02:27:19] Actually, I don't even have like two, three things.
[02:27:22] One of the main ones are like, you know, when you, I make them go super low, like maybe
[02:27:26] waste, maybe handstand push ups and no bra.
[02:27:30] I'm still a beginner at the rings.
[02:27:32] But so I'll hold them in front of me and then I'll do it.
[02:27:35] It's kind of like a ab roller kind of thing.
[02:27:37] So it's one arm at a time or both arms.
[02:27:39] Both arms.
[02:27:40] And then sometimes I'll go like, why didn't you narrow whatever.
[02:27:42] So I'll do those.
[02:27:43] I'll do like sets of 10.
[02:27:44] And you can adjust like how high it's.
[02:27:46] So hard and easier it is, whatever.
[02:27:47] But I'll let me drop the ground.
[02:27:49] We can go to a full extension.
[02:27:51] You can't get there.
[02:27:52] I'm going to get there.
[02:27:53] Nonetheless, between every exercise, actually, no, between every set, you do a set of
[02:27:59] 10.
[02:28:00] That's like the workout.
[02:28:01] Because it's not super exhausting to do it.
[02:28:03] You know, so it's like an active rest.
[02:28:05] Good man, I think it'll it'll take your like workout to the next.
[02:28:09] The thing people say that to the next level, that doesn't mean anything to the
[02:28:14] main.
[02:28:15] I guess even if it doesn't take it, if it takes to the will help you get jacked.
[02:28:18] Let me briefly explain what that means to the next level.
[02:28:23] So like when you do, I don't know dead lifts or I don't know shoulder pressure something.
[02:28:29] Like when you're.
[02:28:31] God is you can see curls.
[02:28:33] Oh, big to curls and try to get extension.
[02:28:35] When you do these things, you're like, since you're like, core, whatever is stronger.
[02:28:38] And this is just what I'm like, you feel when you, you're, of course, strong as feels
[02:28:42] like you have way better balance.
[02:28:43] You have like way better control of of the weight so you get stronger overall.
[02:28:47] Boom.
[02:28:48] Just just from rings.
[02:28:50] Yeah.
[02:28:51] Anyway, yeah, anyway, on it.com, that's where you get all this cool stuff.

[02:29:32] And thank you for posting the reviews on Amazon.
[02:29:36] That's so cool to read and see little pictures of kids reading the book.
[02:29:39] And I'm just super stoked on that book.
[02:29:42] So thank you for that and way the warrior kid for the kids.
[02:29:44] I don't know, maybe just a little bit older.
[02:29:46] That's a book about getting on the path for kids.
[02:29:50] And it's going to help them in every possible element of their life that I can think of
[02:29:57] right now.
[02:29:59] It will, it will help them.
[02:30:00] I think so.
[02:30:01] It'll make them smarter.
[02:30:02] It'll make them work harder.
[02:30:04] It'll make them understand discipline.
[02:30:05] It'll make them stronger.
[02:30:07] It'll just help them across the board.
[02:30:08] That's way the warrior kid and the follow on mission.
[02:30:11] The follow on book to that is way the warrior kid marks mission.
[02:30:16] The next is the discipline equals field.
[02:30:19] The discipline equals freedom field manual, which is a book about how to get after it.
[02:30:25] Yeah.
[02:30:26] The book.
[02:30:27] It's the book about how to get.
[02:30:28] It is not a throw away.
[02:30:30] A book by any stretch.
[02:30:31] No.
[02:30:32] It is.
[02:30:33] How would you describe it?
[02:30:35] I mean, annual.
[02:30:36] It's a manual, but I mean, instrument.
[02:30:38] No, what's the word you used earlier?
[02:30:41] Esthetically.
[02:30:42] Esthetically.
[02:30:43] Could you possibly look, just look, the external part, just the cover of the field manual
[02:30:53] and think maybe I'll do a little extra work today.
[02:30:55] Yes.
[02:30:56] That is entirely possible.
[02:30:57] Yeah.
[02:30:58] Was you know what's in it?
[02:31:01] Get after it material.
[02:31:03] Yeah.
[02:31:04] And I was thinking about this too, not extensive thought, but there's an audio version of this.
[02:31:10] True.
[02:31:11] True.
[02:31:12] Which is cool, which is good.
[02:31:13] But it's kind of like one of those things where you kind of like, man, I kind of want
[02:31:16] the physical book.
[02:31:17] Even if I'm more of an audio book person, I want that physical book because of it's
[02:31:24] aesthetics heavy.
[02:31:25] It's heavy.
[02:31:26] It has black pages.
[02:31:27] Let's just put it to you.
[02:31:28] That.
[02:31:29] Let's start with that.
[02:31:30] Have you ever seen a book with black pages?
[02:31:31] No, you haven't.
[02:31:32] No.
[02:31:33] Get the field manual right there.
[02:31:34] If you do want the audio version, then it's on iTunes, Amazon, and music, Google Play.
[02:31:38] It's not on audible because I wanted you to be able to use it as a alarm.
[02:31:45] Some of those things, little warnings.
[02:31:47] Yeah.
[02:31:48] Tracks ready to be played at a moment's notice.
[02:31:50] Yeah.
[02:31:51] And that's the thing too, where if you time, if you set up a timer, where when you were
[02:31:55] going to lunch, sugarcooked,
[02:31:57] or a recorded live play, you can check.
[02:31:59] Oh, man, perfect example.
[02:32:03] Because the thing is, some of these chapters or whatever, you're going to identify with
[02:32:07] more than the next chapter.
[02:32:09] Especially if you like donuts or pasteries, the sugarcooked live is one.
[02:32:15] You're going to be referencing that a little bit more, right?
[02:32:17] So we're sick.
[02:32:18] Okay.
[02:32:19] So you have that option now.
[02:32:20] That's good to put it on the timer.
[02:32:22] Good.
[02:32:23] Check.
[02:32:24] Yeah.
[02:32:25] Next book is, well, I'll talk about two books together.
[02:32:28] Extreme ownership and dichotomy and leadership.
[02:32:30] These are two books about the lessons learned on the battlefield.
[02:32:34] Myself and Lave Babin wrote the books.
[02:32:37] He was in task, you know, bruiser as the Charlie Patoon commander.
[02:32:42] And we took the lessons that we learned over there.
[02:32:45] We brought him back.
[02:32:46] We started teaching them to the seals that were getting ready to deploy.
[02:32:49] And we wrote extreme ownership.
[02:32:51] When we got out and started working with companies and saw that all the lessons that we learned.
[02:32:54] Transferred to the civilian sector.
[02:32:58] And then we wrote the dichotomy leadership as a follow-on book, which some people are saying is better.
[02:33:06] I don't know which one is better.
[02:33:08] But I do know that they will make you better.
[02:33:11] They will make you a better leader.
[02:33:13] So check those out.
[02:33:15] Extreme ownership dichotomy leadership.
[02:33:17] Mikey in the dragons way the warrior kid marks mission and discipline equals freedom.
