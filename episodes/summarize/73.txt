You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, right? He he said the other day there's an article about him because he's extremely well read and He has a personal library of seven thousand books Very smart very well educated very well read, but what he said is very similar to what I said He said you know I wouldn't get I'm not gonna get surprised Because what I'm gonna face on the battlefield someone else is faced before and he made a couple comparisons I can't think of him off the top of my head, but you know when I saw this when he you know He said when I saw this for the first time I remembered this historical situation when I saw that for the first time I remembered this historical situation so I never was surprised By what I was seeing because I had seen it before maybe only the book But at least you have a heads up and that's what you're looking for and What's cool is if you extrapolate the war which is what we're doing on this podcast taking the war piece of it And extrapolating the human nature piece of it and that's gonna give you a broad look at the way people act the way humans act and interact and That's what I think has been Really good for me to just really the other thing is when you you know when you teach it to do to move and you get better at it Just by teaching it and you understand it more well for me by writing the notes and putting them in the podcast and then Thinking about which direction I'm gonna go and what I'm gonna talk about. very It's very powerful or if he's on the bottom you want guard kind of thing You can see you know cuz you kind of explain so when I first started Jitu like an actual class I knew what guard was I knew what mount was I knew those positions in why they're important where you know Like if you're if someone's mounted on you where a hoist crazy would always be mounted on the person It's like it's really hard to get out He's gonna struggle and and if you turn over your even worse Situation, you know, so I kind of knew that so I knew the actual context and A lot of people when they go and you just to just because they hear about how cool it is they don't have that that that foundation going in so I think man I think that I don't know if they'd ask for it or what Well now this is known now the other thing is the better you are with Jitsu and better you are at fighting the less Apped the less likely you are to have to use it because Because people will know that by the way you're acting that you're probably not a person that should be messed with And The other thing is I think when people actually know how to fight They put up less of a front about who they are about trying to act like a tough guy because hey, man I'm feeling pretty good, you know I got no problem saying hi to you I can I can say hi to you in the street like hey how's it going? Yeah, I'm gonna tell you what you do let him out of their lanes Let him into your lane let him run some stuff Build a new leader to beautiful thing when You you know when you're insecure you want you don't want them to shout out shine you you know You can tell that where I think it's natural though You know when people Maybe a little insecure you know or if you're not as good as maybe you hope or what I think it's natural be a little bit insecure of course Here's how in my experience This is why it's important You know just like how you did at the master where you like you know, you know, I can you you can hit just like that and then that'll provide Consident at the end how you taught a move you know submission or whatever then it's like okay in mount So I man I would recommend that big time where and you'll be more compelled to do it when you find a hot fungie You do it and you're like shoot I could be like getting after it rolling way better if my shoulder like just felt better and Man you go do some extra stuff like all these little rotator movements for your shoulder because I Shoulder to massage like during the demonstration you know, sorry, it's not sometimes During the demonstration pulls my shoulder out which was kind of hurt from like the day before from And typically that'll have a lot to do with sales, you know, like where I can be like, hey, I have, you know, a team of, you know, and I've heard the sales pitch, you know, where it's like, hey, we have seven, seven black belts on the mat, three world champ. You know when you do that you go on there and you hey, let me see this podcast you got to search podcast You got to type in in on your phone Actually not that big with deal, but it would be even less of a big deal if you subscribe You just click on my podcast boom updated automatically right there So subscribe to the podcast that's a good way to support leave a review if you're in the mood Chocolate said something extra dope you're like hey like that leave a review feel free Like no, I don't want what you call that Muzzle like what you put on the dogs to stop Yeah, you know I'm beating you in the head because I don't know how to use a choke-old unfortunately because in some areas choke-old or illegal So again as the outsider You want to pull them out of that you want to talk to them you want to get them to see that outside of the emotional storm that they're in both sides Both sides are an emotional storm Physical intervention, you know now we're talking like this is a serious step you start stepping into these scenarios You don't you know you want to be very very careful about stepping into these one of these situations and And even that physical escalation should be or physical Intervention should be just with a subtle purpose of deescalating, right? And that's like if you, if you, because name dropping typically, it's like, you know, it's almost like a week attempt at breezy and over, you know, who are I'm texting with Joe Rogan, you know, or they'll like say their little credentials. So thanks everyone for listening and making me do this podcast once a week whether I like it or not And actually yeah, and that's another thing Where you know we almost went to one podcast every two weeks and and so I was just talking to a buddy mind that's in a company that I was talking about he was that one of the few guys when we I kind of was thinking about this idea of Of you know going to one podcast every two weeks and we were driving the same as Mike and great guy Great leader and we're driving and I and I said hey, you know I'm just we were driving to go do some work. That's why we see it because it's now news it's now news So be very very careful about that again You know most of the time you know just trying to escalate it verbally Ask if they need any assistance ask if you can call 911 form and get more assistance for them Ask if they need any help talk to that you know do that take that approach If you have to physically intervene Especially if you have some experience You know let them know what you're doing. So you got to be very very cautious about what you're doing there and You know at what would I do in a situation where I saw someone getting you know Be to death You know, I'm gonna do what I just said you know now might I go a little bit further because I have a lot of experience and maybe I can handle situation and deescalated physically but it um it One of the other things kind of like what you're saying is I gonna go is um you kind of either do it and get it done Like this is what a person in my experience Be from experience where you know like you'll ask about about something like hey, what's the status on this or that but they come in You got to stop your conversation, you know, yeah, that's like a little indicator, you know If you roll up to see people across the room talking and you're like hey that looks like a cool conversation or whatever I think that if you and I guess this goes out to like anyone who goes into their Jitu class and learned Just happened to be on the day where you learn like some kind of arbitrary move given the fact that you don't know the foundation It with the foundation any move is gonna make a lot more sense as long as you have that foundation Important somehow important of guard the importance of you know all these other things Of course we all want to learn the submission what cool submission? but I'm saying if you like old school jiu jitsu where You's probably started Jiu Jitsu because of hoist Gracie if you're one of these people one of us That's what I started Jiu to hoist Gracie when you have see one tooth, you know Where we looked at Jiu Jitsu as okay if I get in a fight with someone I want to be up to win the fight even if he's bigger than me It wasn't because oh I want to be the next world champion, you know concerned about how to effectively hold You know the most points of my body points in this and I don't know the way he talked was kind of not funny like a comedian But just kind of you know some people when they talk it's just kind of entertaining You know every time everyone's in all though you certain words that's just kind of unique to them Yeah, I feel like when I was back to the Balancer situation when guys would you know Fight would break up so in a club on a fight break breaks out is more chaotic than you know in the street when you see two guys fighting So it's a little bit more dangerous when you jump into the fight to try to break it up because if you just jump in and Grab the guy the guy doesn't know if you're trying to break up the fight or if you're a guy You're just another attacker. and I don't I mean Maybe that's a deficient something about some kind of deficiency when that happens you know when they call brain fart I'm in a brain fart you know you don't get brains of constant It's like gas-ex for your brain essentially you know how like gas-ex You know, but I think if you say, you know, how's texting with my friend and it was actually Joe Rogan, you know, and you make it like a point to emphasize like that, that, that, that, this wasn't just anyone. It's like or you know the strong team is like the stepchild like is for his recognition But strong team is super important you lose that you know when you get old in whatever, but that's what that's a strong Bone is yeah, So Echo One of you go ahead and talk about how we can Support this podcast if we want to if we want to and support yourself if we want to which we do by the way So talk about on it on it supplements Physical and mental by the way, so I think you know I don't know if we failed to mention this or we just been mentioning it a little bit less Which is Alpha brain We haven't talked about I feel like we haven't talked about Alpha brain that much recently been taking it by the way But not talking about it exactly right that's exactly what it is That's actually one of the reasons I was listening to you know Brady guys they have that the true Project podcast I was just going with um with our bill our either our bill I don't know how you say I just know I just know is your And then they go in there and then let's say the first day they'll learn you know just an arm lock from the bottom or you know Something that if you don't go in with the full context of what Jiu Jitsu is it won't Translate you know you learn a movie and you'll be like wait how how am I gonna go in a fight now? and so I can get through the pain of you know I don't know Matt cons or whatever That's like listen to listen to no music but it turns out I like that better now because you just feel more in touch with like what you're doing Um, but oh, here's that here's one You got to build that relationship You're going to talk to him about why they're going over your head Then you know what when they say well I'm going over your head because this happens you go Oh, I didn't know that you know I'm going to get that fix and you build up a little trust
