and you let them come up with the plan echo we're going to protect this we're going to fill in the podcast it's going to be underwater we're going to need four cameras because we got four guests good that's it that's all I'm going to tell you now you're going to figure out what kind of housing and what kind of tripod and how you're going to do it and what you're going to run wires now we're going to talk when we're moving we're moving you're going to figure all that stuff out a mission and then analysis the mission a mission is task and purpose clearly indicating the action to be taken and the reason for the action best the mission task and purpose clearly indicating the action to be taken and the reason for the action the commander must understand the mission intent and concept of operation one and two levels higher this understanding makes it possible to exercise disciplined initiative and it's kind of implicit here that not only must you understand the the concept of operation and the intent and the mission one and two levels above you but man you got to make sure you understand the broad strategic mission as well everyone needs to understand these things and the classic example I'll use is when in in the battle for money to think everybody needs to know that what we're trying to do is provide security for the populace so everyone's got to have that in the back of their mind when you're going out and there's civilians and you know that what you need to do is protect them It meant have a plan man you know like even just I mean this is a common one where it's like yeah plan out your day or plan out your week or whatever or even like it kind of applies to everything really like anything that you want to do well it's like you're going to have some sort of a. Solid plan that you know varying levels of flexibility obviously depends on what it is but like even if you want to you want to lose weight or you want to. because when you think about it and I sort of realize this when you talk about like training whether it be police or even fighters and stuff like that where if you think of high level performance like industries we'll say the NFL saying right millions of dollars per person by the way NBA whatever think about their situation it's like how much of their time do they spend actually performing very little prepared to train in all day every day off season spring time no matter you know the seasons what 13 games on mean while they're training training training training training training and then what kind of training do they do it's all rehearsals essentially I mean sure there's some academic stuff for sure but as far as when you go to practice as a football player basketball player what are you doing rehearsals all day going full speed actually and maybe you don't crush your joints or nothing like that like you can kind of get by like you can like all just why I was just warming up a little bit more like my this shoulder right here is like just this little real specific part I know I get that right there too if I do this is not specific weighted dips I get this so I like I like these candy bars I don't eat them all the time actually I barely eat candy bars you know like a king size candy bar most things with peanut butter is gonna be you know like kind of go to when I do go to those so those are kind of like a dessert right so if you're in business and you have the opportunity to take out a competitor but whatever that competitor employees a bunch of people in a certain area and you take them out well what does that do to your reputation know how and you just shut them I like that that's the kind of thing you need to think about what think about the other effects to for lack of a better word the civilian population and it's something the military you get trained very specifically to consider all the time that's that's why I wanted to bring it up some of the things that they point out inside of the inside of the civilian considerations ethnic dynamics organizations of influence patterns leaders and influencers which I know you're one of those right an influencer and then economic environment so those are some of the things you need to think about getting into the course of action development course of action development the purpose of a course of action development is to determine one or more ways to accomplish the mission consistent with the battalion commanders intent and you don't need to worry about the commanders the time battalion intent if you didn't get the mission from them so anyway again that's like how not to deal with a narcissist you know like like if you if I were to be like hey chocolate you're freaking you're you're you give up too easy or something like that right sometimes that helps people when you're like oh I'm looking at this problem I see the premiere solution some of the criteria for a course of action should be suitable if executed the course of action accomplishes the mission legally and ethically while consistent with the battalion commanders concept intent that's like one of those obvious things you're talking about like yes the course of action should complete the mission should be feasible meaning the company has the technical and tactical skills and resources to accomplish the course of action with the available time space resources and availability abilities that one's real obvious acceptable military advantage gained by executing the course of action must justify the cost in resources especially casually yes distinguishable this one's a little bit important if more than one course of action is developed does it differ significantly from the other solutions so is it truly different or is it six and one half does any other and believe me and watch people fight about six and one half does any other all the time and is it complete does the course of action cover the operational factors of who what where went why so those are the things you're looking at yeah that that sounds like a good way to deal whether you're not adding fuel to the fire nope in fact you're extinguishing the fire because fuel to the fire is positive or negative reaction it's any reaction anything that feeds the idea that like what I say and do affects the world so hugely you know so this person getting mad or happy or impressed or whatever like any like strong reaction is like hell and maybe it hits you know check you get to this point here where it is identify tentative decision decisive point decisive points good words with the doctoral term decisive point is where you it's like a thing that happens a point that you reach where now you should win right now you have like a marked advantage over the enemy different for different situations you know when you've got you know when Dean Lister grabs a hold of your leg it's a decisive point Getting you know you got a meal prep you got workout prep like you're going to know what you're going to do unless you're like one of these instinctive training guys which is like way down the line pretty much knowing can do it. I got burpees I got pull ups I got you know like I typically know how many you know I even quite frankly we talk about this lot I even know how much rest I'm going to take him between you know but if you if you look at this it shows you the level of detail that they are asking people to think through this information you know just just page after page of terrain analysis you produce several specific conclusions listed below batten support by fire assault fire positions engagement areas and ambush sites immediate immediate objectives asset out locations such as enemy personnel is going on and on and on and then it goes in the five aspects of military weather visibility wins precipitation crowd cover temperature and humidity it just details each one of those and then it goes into analysis of the enemy jumping through a little section of this analyzing the enemy answers the question what is the enemy doing in a why the commander answers what is the composition and strength of the enemy force what are the capabilities of their weapons and other systems what is the location of current and probable enemy positions what is the enemy's most probable course of action are they going to defend reinforced attack withdrawal delay and then you start talking about assumptions about the enemy and then you start talking about the doctrinal analysis of the enemy which is what you try to figure out how the enemy is going to fight you then composition of the enemy then disposition of the enemy then the strength of the enemy then the capabilities of the enemy and then recent activities of the enemy you see where I'm going with this yeah because a real narcissist literally can't see why like they're not correct in the way they're thinking about themselves so it's like they for real think that everyone else sees the same thing as they do you know it's like it's literally that's what they think so when you tell if you were narcissist and I was like you know so it's so sketch as far as like the differentiator is like a normal person if someone's like hey like you're you're kind of a narcissist a normal person would be like but I've never watched one any of it's the guy from the first song okay more knowledge just thrown out there for the world didn't appreciate amen tell me part of it uh next section analysis of time available time available refers to many factors during the operations plan during the operations process plan prepare execute and assess the four categories the commander considers include planning and preparation operations next high-rational on time line enemy timeline I think about that enemy timeline important thing to think about can we move fast enough that we disrupt their timeline we don't want to give them time to set up that's another thing that I didn't talk about when I talked about the importance of time and managing time and understanding time and that you don't get a second chance with time is that when you have an opportunity to disrupt your enemy the more time you give them the less disruptive it will be that's why when you're doing jjitsu and you you know how the armlock is there for a second but I always found the course of action debate right because you got this guy wants to do it this way and this guy wants to do it another way and there's always a little debate about how we're going to do this since I took so many leadership lessons over the years from watching or being a part of those various course of action debates we what do you like it because they'll create it for whatever because it's it's a real good problem solving drill and it's also a really good leadership drill because you can watch the dynamics of yourself and other people and when you know when I say no this is the best way to do it you're like and you know what to do get challenge your team you say look I think my plan is perfect who thinks they could poke a hole in this plan right give them a little incentive to try and to try and poke holes because otherwise they're going to go easy on you and you do not want that goes on to course of action comparison in selection if the commander is developed more than one course of action the commander must compare them by weighing specific advantages disadvantages, strengths and weaknesses of each as noted during a war game these attributes may pertain to the accomplishment of the company's purpose that you send the terrain the destruction of the enemy or other aspect of the operation the commander believes the commander believes to be important very straightforward very obvious you take your two it's funny how often you have to actually say well let's figure out which one is better you know We were going through some problem and I was talking about the risk involved and they said something along the lines and be like, like, the team's like, you're very schooled and you know risk evaluation or whatever some statement like that. but if you get it you know it's like it makes it super easy usually they don't last long like you know one of those guns that like you shoot at once and it kills everybody you know those I mean, of course the obvious ones if you're going to kill somebody or something like that or do something like illegal where it's going to be like, right, you're going to go to jail for that or something else that kind of stuff, but we seldom talk about you know lack of confidence and the reason that we the reason that I lean towards talking about staying humble and checking your ego the reason that I lean towards that is because that's the majority of the time that's the problem why because I'm talking to leaders and how do leaders end up in leadership positions because they had confidence and so the tendency is that confidence is going to grow out of control it's not a tendency that someone gets to a leadership position through confidence and then all of a sudden it falls apart that can happen it does happen you can also get young leaders that are getting put into a leadership position that lack of confidence so sometimes you do have people their confidence gets hurt their confidence doesn't exist and you have to improve their confidence so I was talking about various things where you want to improve the confidence of yourself or the confidence of your subordinates and one of the things that I talked about like let's say you have a subordinate that has to present and they're not letting presenting they they blew they blew another gig where they were supposed to be presenting to a client no matter what I think it's like the process though you know how like you know how like kids they want a bedtime story but I know I'm in trouble I know I'm in half the scramble so those are that's what a decisive point is and this is a very interesting statement here identifying a tentative decisive point and verifying it during a course of action development is the most important aspect of the troop leading procedure the commander visualizes a valid decisive point to determine how to achieve success and accomplish the missions purpose the commander develops the entire course of action from the decisive point without determining a valid decisive point the commander cannot begin to develop an appropriate course of action so that is a bold statement so to be clear on the decisive point because these kind of both make sense where okay it's it's not necessarily but here here's the thing like compared to not having it it's like night and dead you know you know there's a lot of games like that where you get this super this one weapon that's super rare so so this idea of rehearsals being sort of a additive measure because I'll tell you what if you were doing a presentation and I ran you through these drills you wouldn't just be a little bit better if something went wrong you would be ten times better in handling that situation you've already been there you've already seen it so rehearsals are something that you as a leader should focus on to such a high level because they are so beneficial not just as an additive but in actually bringing together and consolidating the plan inside of people's heads how they're going to react what they're going to do during various contingencies it is a powerful tool and in the seal teams what we used to say was one third planning one third preparation one third rehearsal the army has something was it what it's like one third two thirds which is one third of the time planning and then the other two thirds are for for people to what do they say prepare and prep or so let's just say things but they don't put that as big as emphasis in that in that saying as we did which is one third planning one third preparation one third rehearsals maybe they mean that inherently but it's something that every person can use so that they can stay clean don't forget about our YouTube channel because echo is putting all kinds of time and effort into YouTube videos are you going to put some kind of a special effect into this video that we're talking about no man I don't know you know there's mixing motions about a lot of people that think that this right there is the best idea you know that anyone's had a long time is to occasionally throw in a some kind of a cool effect into this video and I've had those discussions with fighters before like okay like you're not throwing any kicks in the first round you're gonna you're not gonna put any real weight behind your punches in the first round second round I'll tell you you know when once you've sloughed off or stuffed three or four take downs in the first round two take down in the second round decisive point just got reached now you start throwing bombs same thing with a grappler so those are the decisive points in a fight you didn't necessarily win just because that happened yeah because you can just die a bunch of times just keep going to you and can you sad though like they could have set these games up so that they were really teaching you something about something right think of like some knowledge some memorization you had to do to get this thing about some important facts or whatever some mental challenges that made you think and you had to know you know when you do something over and over and over again it's just like it's almost like more habit than what if it's like a long day and you've been editing you know a hard rigorous hard brutal editing
