so Reno's guys are now getting basically surrounded in taking up this new position sergeant or hair of troop m had been killed the first man on the skirmish line to die apparently Reno had a fairly defendable position and some people think if he had pulled in his lines and consolidated in his position he might have held out here for an indefinite length of time or at least as long as his ammunition lasted but the savage yells the heavy firing the smoke and dust all and fear all combined to fog his judgment suddenly custers favorite scout bloody knife was shot through the head and his brain scattered all over Reno then the scout dorm in fell and Charlie Reynolds was shot through the head Reno figuring that his only chance lay and getting to high ground across the river shattered for his men to mount up in company formation two troop commanders heard the order and amid the confusion and excitement had their men mount up and line in column of force the third troop G under Lieutenant Mackintosh himself part Indian who had been adopted by general Mackintosh was in the woods and did not get the order until the two other troops with Reno writing at their head were racing upstream trying to find a place to cross the river all order and discipline were gone so they're surrounded things fall apart he's basically saying we got a retreat we got to get out of here and the assessment was that maybe they were in a defendable position they could have held there who knows who knows whether that's true or not nobody will ever know how any man escaped alive from this mad retreat all we are sure of is that the charging troop broke through the cordon of mounted Indians and followed a buffalo craft to the river here they somehow managed to jump their horses over a four or five foot bank plunged across the stream and scrambled up a narrow trail to the steep hills to the east hundreds of Indians fired indiscriminately into the pan extra consulgers and the wonder is that any trooper escaped no motion picture could be as fantastic as this wild milling of frightened men and horses again just to remind you that this is what's happening with Reno in his group they don't know where customers right now with his crew of 200 guys back to the book in all 26 troopers and scouts and three officers were killed either in this ride through the Indian gauntlet or back at the edge of the woods of the 19 men left behind 17 cross the river and reached Reno Hill on foot within two hours Lieutenant Darudio and private O'Neill did not join us until 36 hours later they came right through where I was on guard it was now somewhere around 330 in the afternoon Reno shaken and unnerved and reached the hilltop and here his frightened troopers were joining him he was whipped and completely disorganized this is a rally point and if you have a pre-designated rally point and you say hey guys look you see this big hill over here if everything goes to hell again we get all jumbled up go to that point it doesn't sound like he actually pre-brief that because that would have been a you could have just said hey back to the rally point you could have been a very clear order if you're trying to not really know where you're going and you're saying retreat it's hot guys are heavy pretty soon it looked as if the Indian masses were coming towards us it didn't take long to realize that this was true here we were stretched out all over hell's half acre a troop on this hill mob another in this little valley in a third and over there a third troop behind at a slow walk came packed trains the wounded men and the rear guard we know and venting both sense danger in order to withdraw the advanced troops were dismounting and fought as skirmishers in the center in a slight depression the horses and mules were staked and an inadequate little field hospital was established but it was impossible to shield the man and stock from the Indians firing from a hilltop off to the east in the Indians got some high ground on them can't stop them what do you think I got high ground you you can't hide animal after animals killed and the men were hit it was tough not to be able to do something about it we'd hardly got settled on our own skirmish line with h men posted at 20 foot intervals when the Indians at all but completely surrounded us and the fighting began in earnest there was no full fledged charge but little groups of Indians would creep up as close as they could get and from behind bushes or little noils open fire they'd practiced all kinds of cute tricks to draw our fire maybe a naked red skin would suddenly jump to his feet and while you drew a beat on him he'd thrown himself to the ground they're under this attack for a pretty good amount of time and then finally the sun went down that night like a ball of fire pretty soon the quick Montana twilight settled down on us and then came the chill of the high planes there was no moon and no one ever welcomed darkness more than we did we felt terribly alone on that dangerous hilltop we were million miles from nowhere and death was all around us all through that short black night the orgy went on down below in the river valley it struck fear in our hearts just as the mystery of custards disappearance made our blood run cold each time we tried to solve it where was custer what had happened to him so down they're up there they're hiding it's dark they're scared they got wounded and all they hear down in the valley is the Indians going crazy the rhythm of the tom tom's the wild victory dance they can hear all this back to the book they're talking about custer so they go out to recover the bodies or bury the bodies their own patrol back to the book suddenly we caught glimpses of white objects lying along the ridge that led northward we pulled up our horses this was the battlefield here custard's lap luck had finally run out from the way the men lay it was clear that the first one troop had been ordered to dismount and fight as a skirmish line then a second troop had been posted a little further on and to the east then a third troop and a fourth and finally there on the knob of a hill lay some 30 bodies in a small circle we knew instinctively we would find custard there we rode forward at a walk most of the troopers had been stripped of clothing and scalp some of them had been horribly mutilated custard was lying a trifle to the southeast of the top of the no where the monument is today i stood six feet away holding cap and bent teens horse while he had identified the general his body had not been touched save for a single bullet hole in the left temple near the ear and a hole on his left breast he looked almost as if it had been peaceably sleeping his brother Tom lay a few feet away he was terribly mutilated scattered over the field where the swollen bodies of the dead horses but there were not many of them it seemed clear that the Indians sweeping up from the draws and coolees on all sides had stampeded the mounts while the men were fighting dismounted from every direction hordes of crazed Indians must have attacked with the wild courage that their desperation and hate gave them nothing could check their mad charges captain bentine found a bit of wood hollowed out a hole found an empty shell wrote custer's name on a bit of paper and placed it in the shell and shoved the deep in the hole in the piece of wood then he pushed this into the ground at custer's head it would make sure that the burial party would identify custer's body the following morning we went back to custer hill and buried as well as we could the naked mutilated bodies of our comrades it was a gruesome task the custer may have made a mistake to divide his command that Sunday afternoon of June 25th but the gods themselves were against him it was the Indians day and I'm gonna go back to finish this up to the section of the book that we started at and that is this account from majorino who we know a little bit more about now they could not all be killed not lucky custer and those five gallant troops who rolled with him why did he abandon us in those three bloody hours before darkness had saved us we had no less than a dozen men killed and three times that number wounded he's actually saying man where was custer here we were getting crushed on the battlefield and custer's not there to support us where to go now during the night it rains a little bit and finally the sun starts to come up and just as the sun starts to come up and starts getting light back to the book Joan said something about taking off his overcoat he started to roll on his side so he could get his arms and shoulders out without exposing himself to fire suddenly I heard him cry out he'd been shot straight through the heart minute or two later another bullet from the hilltop torn to the hickory butt of my rifle splitting it squarely into I was plenty mad because my army carbine wouldn't let me return the compliment so he just got shot the rifle stock actually happened one of my guys in in Ramadi one of my guys got his his rifle stock up blown up by an RPG I seem to come fall out of a sniper position and he's got his his weapon is in two pieces I'm thinking no lucky to be alive along about this time our 30 or 40 wounded men began crying out for water h-trupe held the hill here on the southwest there was a draw that ran down the west side of the hill to the river it was a rough and exposed and it looked like a dead cinch that anyone who tried to work his way down that drug the river would be killed Indians concealed in the bushes across the river were firing up at us and they had every foot of this draw on riverbank covered well you don't do it in a very organized fashion so pre-plants some contingencies hmm now they get in this position and Reno like I said is in rough shape back to the book cool capable bending more or less assumed command major Runu Reno had just come through a terrible experience and at the moment was glad to have bending his junior take over quickly bending dismounted his own three troops and ordered us to form a scourmet line Reno's men had expanded most of their ammunition so we were told to divide ours with them we had bantines 120 men intact and there were around 60 men who'd been fighting in the valley with Reno and even before we got the kinks out of our legs from our long horse hours in the saddle we were asking each other where's custard what had become of custer and his five troops apparently custer was now much farther on to the northward and in this moment was hotly engaged but no one was certain all we knew was that he had disappeared with almost half the regiment we could hear the sound of distant firing echoing through the hills and valleys from that direction custer must be down there so this is happening they're in the skirmish position and they're starting to try and get reorganized back to the book the wounded man who could mount were put on horses but the others were carried in blankets by details of six troopers on foot takes a lot of people to carry a downman downman takes a lot of people to carry a downman and in this case it takes six people to carry one downman nowadays we weigh a lot more we got we got all reguns we got body armor I saw Charlie Reynolds nod and agreement to them and was chilled again when he said in a low voice I feel as he does tomorrow will be the end for me too anyone who wants my little outfit of stuff pointing to his war pack can have it now lieutenant Varna who is in charge of the scouts came over and said that it was general custards planned to attempt to surprise attack on the camp of the enemy said bloody knife we cannot surprise the enemy they are not crazy without dumb without doubt their scouts have watched every move we have made convinced at last that we could not possibly surprise the enemy general custer ordered a quick advance with the scouts and himself in the lead we had not gone far when bloody knife and his two reeds joined us and reported that on the other side of the ridge they had found the day old trail of many more enemy going toward the valley of little big horn they were excited and said to custer general we have discovered the camp down there on the little big horn it is a big one too big for you to tackle why there are thousands and thousands of sue and shions down there for moment the general stared at him angley I thought and then said sternly I shall attack them classic ego maniac right here hey we're gonna get over run this our biggest problem right now is we're gonna get over run so you know what hey major reno give me a bunch of guys and we're gonna go do an aggressive assault and take care of this number one priority so let's focus our forces on that here we go and that's what they did they got aggressive and got after it back to the book the gun fired almost ceased and some of us left our trenches and stood in little groups on the brow of the hill then something happened that I'll never forget if I lived to be a hundred the heavy smokes seem to lift for a few moments and they're in the valley below we caught glimpses of the thousands of Indians on foot and horseback with their pony hordes with their pony herds dogs and pack animals and all the trappings of a great camp solely moving southward it was like some biblical Exodus the Israelites moving into Egypt's a mighty tribe on the march we thought at first that it must be some trick that the Indians were only moving their families from danger and that the warriors would soon return and try to overwhelm us patiently we waited in our little trenches along June afternoon dragged on the firing at all but ceased the smoke in the valley had blown away and the last Indian had gone then reno ordered the whole camp to move as close to the river as possible we would get as far as ways we could from the terrible stench of death there was plenty of water now for the wounded and towards the evening the company cooks made us the best meal they could at least we had hot coffee and plenty of bacon and so card tack it was our first meal in 36 hours then night came down we were weary but while those on guard were awake and alert the rest of the command slept but it was an uneasy sleep we still had heard no word from costor we began to suspicion that some terrible fate might have overtaken him what it was we could only guess the sun was well in the sky that next morning of the 27th we saw dust rising slowly from so then they get approached by a young officer that had been out scouting what was happening a young officer phung himself off his horse he was lieutenant Bradley chief of scouts early this morning scouting in the hills on the east side a little horn lieutenant Bradley had come across a battlefield dotted with the white bodies of dead men he had counted more than 190 dead he was certain that costor was among them apparently no white man had escaped one or two crow scouts notably young curly had reported at the steamer far west at the junction of little big horn and big horn the day before there had been no interpreter on hand but curly had to convince the officers that all white soldiers who rode with custard had been killed at dawn lieutenant Bradley in a few men and a few men had started out to search for the field of tragedy curly was right no soldier a white man had escaped a little later the slight figure of bearded general Terry with his staff and a small escort arrived on the hill there were tears running down as cheeks when he spoke I think most of us had tears in our eyes too more than 200 of our comrades had met a violent death and now naked and unbearied were lying in the hot Montana 7 3 miles northward so it's not part of the story it's after the story but it talks about did Custer refuse advice from his scouts how many Indian warriors were camped on the West Bank of the Little Big Horn that Sunday morning of June 25th against the real figure how many Custer think he would have to fight did Custer refuse to believe the estimated number of warriors his scouts told him he would have to fight did he fail to follow the advice of his experienced guides and interpreters one of the best accounts of what the guides thought about the number of Indians and the chances of Custer closing with them is contained in the excellent book William Jackson Indian Scout by James William Schultz, Willard Schultz, it is worth careful reading and here's a couple excerpts from that on the third day we struck the trail of the hostels the one that Reno had found several days before said bloody knife now remember bloody knife is is Custer's you know main scout their their type said bloody knife my friends the bit this big trail proves what we heard that the Ogalala the Minicon Jew the Sandsark and the Teton Sue have left their agencies to join sitting bull and but when fired rapidly the breach became foul and the greasy cartridges is often jammed it could not be removed by the extractor this meant that the empty shell had to be forced out by the blade of a hunting knife this very fact was responsible for the death of many a trooper this hot Sunday and may actually have been the indirect cause of the great disaster weapons getting dirty weapons getting hot dirty got to take care of your weapon it sounds like this was beyond them just taking care of their weapon sounds like it was a design issue as well Reno had crossed the river and had his troops in line of columns of four with the Indian with the Indian scouts on his left soon Indian horsemen were seen riding madly two and throw in the valley and shortly the southern end of the Indian camps came in to view Reno now had his three troops and scouts thrown out in a skirmish line covering possibly the full width of the narrow valley so there they see the enemy now they get online that's a very common thing if you can picture this you've got your guys in a column how many if you're in a column of three three columns and you see the enemy ahead of you how many people do you think can shoot the three the three the three of the front so that's the note that they get from custer sounds like custer might have once he split off things started going sideways real quick they again Benteen and Reno have their troops start now getting engaged in a firefight back to the book we could hear heavy firing now before long we passed several crow or re-scouts driving a few head of Indian ponies and they shouted soldiers in pointed toward the bluffs that were rising towards the north we knew that we were close to the valley of little big horn and that's somewhere in this neighborhood there was hard fighting going on Benteen ordered us to draw pistols and we charged up the bluffs that had gallop expecting at any moment to run into hostels when we reached the brow with the first set of rolling hills the river valley suddenly opened up below us to our left it was a sight to strike terror in the hearts of the bravest men down there in the valley you'll get killed don't worry about me he answered grimly I'm all right he sure lived a charmed life that day but things look bad and finally benteen hurried to the north side of the lines and asked major reno for reinforcements he made it clear that the Indians were about to charge his line and if they were able to sweep over it the whole outfit would be destroyed reno told him to take as much of mtrupe as he could gather those men certainly look good to us soon after they came up captain benteen led the charge yelling and firing we went at the double quick and the Indians broken ran when we had cleaned them out for a hundred yards ahead of us we hustled back to our holes once again we settled back to the business of getting fired at with men hit at intervals with men hit at intervals and with the poor horses and mules taking a terrible beating in their hollow it must have been a long time about long about this time that benteen called me to attention and made me sergeant we had one sergeant two men killed and 12 wounded and aged treep alone so once again we see some aggressive and we also see some focus of forces right we see some prior exercise next to you but we were to pump as much lettuce we could into the bushes where the Indians were hiding while the water party hurried down to the draw got their buckets and pots and canteens filled and then made their way back so we got a little cover move happening obviously it just happened that the four of us who were posted on the hill were all German boys, Giger, Meckling, Voight and myself none of us were for wounded although we stood exposed on that ridge for more than 20 minutes and they threw plenty of lettuce several of the water party however were badly wounded although we kept the steady fire into the bushes where the Indians were hiding each of us was given a congressional metal of honor you don't think about that you don't think about you you actually gonna need water you run out of water you're gonna get guys dehydrated and a dinosaur you're gonna risk people's lives to go get water benteen had been walking up and down the line urging men to hold fast not to waste their fire and to keep cool I remember saying to him Colonel you better get down sir hmm this is not a good plan so back to the book apparently cost her had planned to stay in hiding in the ravine we had reached a little after 10 o'clock that Sunday and then attacked the village a daybreak the next morning of the 26 that would more or less have doubled tailed and deterries idea of boxing the Indians but when he found the hostile scouts had discovered his column he figured there was nothing to do but attack it once now we get a little um a little report here from a guy named Sergeant Daniel Knapp who had barely turned 23 at the time of the battle in Knapp's own account of the fight published in the magazine of the historical society of Montana he said when we got to the top of the buffs the Indians had disappeared but we were in plain view of the Indian camps which appeared to cover a space of about two miles wide and four miles long on the west side of the river we were then charging at full speed this camp is two miles wide that's a map two miles two maybe 150 feet or more below us and somewhere around a half a mile away there were figure galloping on horseback and much shooting farther down the river there were great masses of mounted men we suspicion were Indians we were going at it at fast clip ourselves and we had no more than caught the swift glimpse of this tragic battlefield below when we saw mounted and dismounted soldiers on a null of a hill onto the northward we swiftly rode towards them so these guys are seeing this massive battle take place they're kind of on the high ground he talks about here what kind of weaponry the the Indians had for my part I believe that fully half of the warriors carried only bows and arrows and lances and that possibly half of the remainder carried odds and end of old muzzle loaders and single shot rifles of various vintage's probably not more than 25 or 30% of the warriors carried modern repeating rifles that sounds pretty close to what wooden legs said they said they mostly had bows and arrows they some guys had rifles three yeah realizing that this charged toward the Indian hordes would end in almost certain disaster Reno now orders troops to dismount and fight on foot even before this order came scores of Indians had swung to the southwestward and pressed against the crow and re-scouts these were forced to give way things were looking bad for Reno any order to skirmish lines to fall back to the edge of a heavy grove of cotton woods that followed a bend in the river and jutted out halfway across the valley the horses were led into the woods wall a thin line of man held three sides of the grove some 90 men were holding not less than 250 yards of line hundreds of mounted Indians were now half circling the skirmish line writing in close firing from under their ponies next and then galloping away Reno's men were now either firing from a prone position or using the bank of a dry creek bed as a bearer create and rifle rest crazy horse horse I'm sure that even this trail does not account for all that have left their agencies they're surely our other trails and trails two of the shy ants and the apraprohose bloody knife continued it is as I have told long hair this gathering of enemy tribes is too many for us but he will not believe me he is bound to lead us against them they are not far away just over this ridge they are all in camp and waiting for us crazy horse and sitting bull are not men without sense they have their scouts too and some of them surely have their eyes upon us well tomorrow we are going to have a big fight a losing fight myself I know what is to happen to me my sacred helper is giving me warning that I am not to see the set of tomorrow's sun sad words those they chilled us So, you know, like, you know, like, people will go to like, a motivational seminar or something. You're like, you know, I'm going to, you know, I've seen, I've never read, does that sounds like that would really be this psychology of people that do that? You know where it's like all right one guy gets mad he slaps this guy, you know, or even I mean it goes really with anything with the slippery slope anything like cheating on your diet. and you got 600 guys and actually they didn't even cost her to have six of her guys to get 200 guys Reno and his troops were again seen to our left moving at full speed down the valley at the site of the Indian camps the boys of our five troops began to cheer over confidence some of the horses became so excited that the riders were unable to hold them in ranks and the last word I heard general custer say were hold your horses in boys there are plenty of them down there for all of us again now we have total overconfidence in the situation we think we're gonna win this is gonna be fun
