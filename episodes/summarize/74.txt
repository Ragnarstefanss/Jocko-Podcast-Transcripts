You know, patches on the, in fact, the Puerto Rican gangs looked more like bikers, like Puerto Rican bikers, without bikes back then, like they all had like patches and jeans and like MC boots, and, you know, they'd wear like the F-True Pats and with total old school, you know, like, you know, wolf tails and shit, you know, like the fur collar. How many bodies I found and came across and, you know, how many, how much madness I had experienced, you know, like we were talking about, you know, it's like sometimes, you know, when you're dealing with life and death on a regular basis, you know, sometimes you're like, you know, God, you start calling out to God. Everybody was, you know, it was, what it means is me about the 80s, is the lawlessness, you know, in New York and in San Francisco, you know, like you could really get away with just about, fucking anything, and there would be like no police, involvement, no repercussion, you know, I mean, you'd get into a fight and the shit could go on for, half a fucking hour, like from one area to another, and back and forth, you know, you're guns, oh, fight. You know, especially when you're dealing with depression and all that shit and again, you know, it's just like, like I said, you know, you know, have someone to love and to feel that that reciprocation and, you know, feel needed, it's hard to not feel needed, you know. You know, so it's like, you know, like I said, you know, like I had that one fight and California where I'm running into a mob of all these dudes, like, you know, I was high off that shit for like a week. You know, and when I started going out to their farm for a little while, like they were getting up at like five, 30 in the morning and meditating and watching the sun come up and like it was like this whole, you know, going from like being like hunted by the gangs in my neighborhood to that, it was just like, I can't even really explain it. Yeah, like the guys in the block, just people who know me from school, like people like, you know, my friends on cools and shit like that, you know, like, you should get the fuck out of here. You know, they, you know, they beside selling heroin, they did hits and, pigman, I'd known about him, my whole child, he was like a lower-yside myth, like, you know, everybody had heard of him, but no one knew, you know, because if you saw him, most likely the last thing you saw, you know, but he would wear a pig's mask. Yeah, like the, and Jimmy Hendrix, you know, he was the Jimmy Hendrix of bass and look at Jimmy and him and it's like, you know, you can have all that talent and if you're, you know, if you're suffering on the inside, man, you know, mean fucking Jocco, there's another tragedy. I mean, I had like fucking recruiting, you know, catalogs and shit under my bed, whereas most kids probably had, you know, their playboys and shit, like my mom would find my rugby, I don't know, their recruiting shit, like what is this? Woo, you know, all these other things that like we're like resonating with me, you know, and it's like, I needed that shit, you know, I needed some sort of guidance and had I not had something like that. You know, like, I'd never, you know, Yeah, we had fun, you know, but we never like gotten brawls and got, you know, right. Everybody has that moment though that period where they really, you know, will not everybody, but everybody who's like intense, you know, you think about your life, you can think of that one period where you were just on fucking point, you know, and they were like 16 at a ended like last week. But, um, yeah, you know, it was a much different place back then, you know, you guys know, you know, but a, you know, a lot of people who have only been here over the last 20. And, yeah, you know, he knew he made a lot of bad choices, but it's fucked up though, because, you know, I mean, he was all, you know, he's fucked up on heroin, and he was in alcoholic, and he actually, like, kicked my mother in the stomach when she was just like very pregnant with me. and it's like mad, screaming and, you know, stabbing, and bottles breaking and no cops, you know, that was like, you know, I mean, shit happens now, man, you fart to fucking loud on the street here. You know, you learn their last name at first, but then you know, you get to know him a little bit and you're like, you know, what's your first name? And it's like, you know, as we all know as parents is like, no, fuck that, you need to know how to do your math. So it was like, you know, also not just feeling like betrayed and everything else that goes along with a breakup, but as any father or stepfather, stepmother, you know, you have a certain, you know, you develop love for a kid even if it's not yours. You know, but eventually she did, you know, unfortunately I had to witness a lot of real, ridiculous shit, but, you know, I don't think there's such a thing as a perfect parent, you know. You just, just, I mean, it'd be like seeing James Brown back when he had Bootsie Collins on base, like back in the old, like when he was like all over the, I always used to like in HR to like James Brown meets Johnny Rotten. And a lot of these after hours clubs, like, you know, saved the robots and the pyramid, and all these other places they had, like, you know, they were the late night free clubs, where everybody would go like to a six in the morning, and they would all be doing blow and doing coke. This affecting people the way you do with music, it's a, you make a connection, you know, you know, look man, I'm sitting across from you now because we're fucking out of my minute, 30 fucking years ago with that fucking tell you, it's bad ass, you know. The next second, you're a tough guy in front of fucking thousands of people and there's lights flashing everywhere, you know, and then, you know, and then some people, it's like your career is done and you're still that tough guy who still will fuck shit up, but nobody gives a fuck and now if you fuck somebody up, you're going to fucking jail. It's like the adrenaline, the fucking, like dude, the last time I got in like a real fucking crate, you know, not the last time, the third or fourth to last time. You know, and I was just like, you know, I just want to fucking, you know, I probably shouldn't say this and probably sounds bad for the military, but I just wanted to kill. You know, and just because I like to think that the end of the day, two people that were friends can laugh at their own foolishness, you know, I would like to think that people are able to look beyond their egos and, and forgive each other for being idiots. And that being weird and almost getting into fights with like dudes who were like X-cons and you know, like dudes who had just got out of prison who were like to them. But for the most part, you know, if you're getting your, you know, I don't know, protein from soybeans or something, you know, I don't get as much protein as you animals over here. They have looked at me like just like a gunslinger just walked it like I was like, you know, fucking wild west. And obviously I've dealt with many, but, you know, especially someone who didn't really have responsible people like really raising me, you know, I, it really hurts to not be there for your kids every day, you know, because I really, I used to cherish those moments more than anything. You know, you know, you know, people they'll be like, hey, no, I don't eat cops. I mean, we were like, you know, funky stuff, you know, I mean, we were playing, like I said, my math teacher, he was one of the band leaders. You know, like fucking, you know, the whole shit was like, damn, man. But I guess, you know, it seemed like there was more opportunity to actually make a living bigger audience, you know, actual record deals, you know, Pantera. I mean, I have to admit that, you know, look at back if you know, if you ever kind of met up, you have to be able to say, yes, I wasn't an asshole, you know, but that shit, yeah, pig man was no joke. You know, and to me, I'm just like trying to, you know, get some food, you know. I don't think for one second because I'm a jujitsu black belt that like, I'm just going to submit this guy and hold him down until the police get here because you know, what, that guy may have through other friends standing in the shadows behind you or that guy may fucking start stabbing you when you're looking to fucking you're trying to, you know, submit him. It's those ones that are like, I don't know how they make them, you know, the inside and the, I don't know. I'm like, you know, you don't gotta worry about like a, you know, a black belt kicking your ass. Like the kid like yourself, like kids who had been listening to Van Hale and then they were little who started getting into hardcore bands started getting more and then they're not know. So the, so I know it is like a real reputable company that, like you know you're getting, because right, you can get supplements. You know, they're kind of bringing back like, I don't know if it's like a reunion fest, bringing back a bunch of old bands. You know, so it's like I feel like in my own way, I managed to do my service to, you know, humanity. Like, hey, you know how, you know, your wife had to lose like 20 to fight stories. But a lot of fighters, you know, you know, you have see fighters and stuff and a lot of those guys have a rough time, you know, absolutely. I don't know, but, you know, I guess it's, I guess, is that like when people talk about, well, when people say to me, oh, I think this is the same thing because I'm sitting here going to happen that before. You know, I remember like eating it soup kitchens, you know, with adults and I'm like 15. You know, I'm like, telling the locals, I'm like, I'm like, shit man, my mother lives on 12th street. Look at all the, you know, all the, you know, a lot of people don't get outside of this country, you know, they live here. You know, and I mean, look, man, you know, the Ramones were, you know, some of the worst greatest musicians ever. So we were kind of fucking up their business too, because we were like, fucking up all the, all the new freaks that we started to come to the lower East side, all the new white people that we were like, you know, fuck, we just made this motherfucking neighborhood safe. And he was, you know, it's like, I'm saying, you know, you got these people who are fucking dangerous motherfuckers.
