00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jocco podcast number 24 with echo Charles and me, Jocco willing.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And our guest tonight is Jodi Middick.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Jodi is a former Canadian Army soldier and sniper who served in Afghanistan.

4
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
He now serves as an elected member of the Ottawa City Council.

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You got second place in a show called the Amazing Race.

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
He authored a bestselling book about his experiences.

7
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
He's a husband and a dad.

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Beyond all that, Jodi is a real hero.

9
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
An absolute inspiration to anybody that knows his story,

10
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
which is what we'll be talking about tonight.

11
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Welcome to the show, Jodi.

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Thank you, Jocco.

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Did I miss anything?

14
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Jocco, make a fan?

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Thanks, man.

16
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now I appreciate that.

17
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Also with us is echo Charles.

18
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Good evening, echo.

19
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Good evening.

20
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Now, before we dig into your book,

21
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I wanted to start off with an excerpt of a poem by Richard Kippling.

22
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And it's called the Young British Soldier.

23
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And I think this is a little bit appropriate since Canada's former part of the Commonwealth of England

24
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and now part of the Commonwealth.

25
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And while Kippling was never actually a soldier, he did attend the United Service College in England,

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
which kind of prepared young men for the Army,

27
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
although he never joined, but he did spend many years abroad in the British colonies.

28
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And he also lost his only son, John, in World War I,

29
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
at the Battle of Luz, in September of 1915,

30
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
where there was just about a hundred thousand casualties,

31
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
in a matter of days, John Kippling was last seen,

32
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
lurching through the mud blindly, crying out in agony.

33
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
After his face had been ripped apart by an exploding shell.

34
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And this poem that I'm about to read a part of is not about World War I.

35
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It's about the British wars that took place from the 1830s to the early 1900s

36
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
in a part of the world called Afghanistan.

37
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And here is this latter part of that poem.

38
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
When first under fire and you're wishful to duck,

39
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
don't look or take heed at the man that is struck,

40
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
be thankful you're living and trust to your luck,

41
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and march to your front like a soldier,

42
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
front front front like a soldier.

43
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
If your officers dead in the sergeants look white,

44
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
remember it's a ruin to run from a fight,

45
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
so take open order, lie down and sit tight,

46
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and wait for supports like a soldier,

47
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000
wait, wait, wait like a soldier.

48
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
When you're wounded and left on Afghanistan's planes,

49
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and the women come out to cut up what remains,

50
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains,

51
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and go to your God like a soldier,

52
00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:06.000
go go go like a soldier.

53
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And I think that poem sets a tone for what kind of a place

54
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to Afghanistan can be.

55
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Yeah.

56
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
It's been a while to hear that.

57
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Yeah.

58
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
That last line's not a joke either.

59
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
No, it isn't.

60
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I'm going to get there in your book here in a minute.

61
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Your book is called Unflinching.

62
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
This is the book right here.

63
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And I kind of made that connection with the Unflinching part.

64
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
You've been a sniper.

65
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
You obviously can't be flinching when you're taking a shot.

66
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Right.

67
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And this whole thing kicks off the first chapter,

68
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
which the name of the first chapter is awesome,

69
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
because this is something that I believe is something

70
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
that a lot of people have. I know I damn sure did.

71
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
The first chapter is called The Soldier in the Child.

72
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And I think that describes a lot of people that joined the military.

73
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Yeah.

74
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
That's the thing that's in there.

75
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
They're born with it.

76
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
You were born with it.

77
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I know I was born with it.

78
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Yeah.

79
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Tell everyone to do.

80
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Tell everyone to do.

81
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Tell everyone to do.

82
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Believe me.

83
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Now your mom, how did she feel about all that?

84
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
She resisted like any 80s mom, right?

85
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
You're a hell do you again?

86
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
44.

87
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So you're a little older than I am,

88
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
but my mom being a foster kid,

89
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
read all the books and all the books the time said,

90
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
boy should play with Barbies and girls.

91
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
You play with Tanka Trucks and treat them gender neutral and blah, blah, blah,

92
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
but guess what?

93
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
If you put boys in a room and girls in a room with toys,

94
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
the boys play with Tanka Trucks and the girls play with the Barbies.

95
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I just the way it is.

96
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Yeah.

97
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And my fact my son,

98
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
I had two daughters that were young

99
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and our house and I didn't want them.

100
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I'm not going to have them have all these Barbies.

101
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
I don't even know where they came from.

102
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
But they showed up at my house.

103
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Yeah.

104
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I guess what?

105
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
My son was born and I was all worried.

106
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
He's going to be playing with Barbies.

107
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
That kid, he had kid didn't care about Barbies.

108
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
He didn't care about all.

109
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
They didn't look at him.

110
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
He anything that had wheels on it.

111
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Yeah.

112
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.000
It's just, and it's just,

113
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
boys and girls are different.

114
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Yeah.

115
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
They're just different.

116
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And, you know what,

117
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I know lots of women that are great soldiers.

118
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I'm not saying that they don't have it.

119
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
But mom wanted, you know,

120
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
no guns, GI Joe's, but no,

121
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
you know, couldn't keep the weapons.

122
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And, you know, and I, and I love her for it because

123
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Who knows who I would have been if she had,

124
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
maybe if she had fostered it,

125
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
it would have, it would have fizzled out.

126
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I don't know.

127
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
But yeah, all I want to do is soldier.

128
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Since I was a, since I was a little boy.

129
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So your mom had that attitude and then along came Uncle Jim.

130
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Yeah.

131
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Yeah.

132
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Uncle Jim.

133
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
They don't tell us a little bit about Uncle Jim.

134
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Well, I mean,

135
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I just saw him the last week and actually he lives in Victoria.

136
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
We're, we're Mr. Echo is born and he,

137
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
when you're a child, right?

138
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
There's nothing more impressionable than a three year old.

139
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Really, right?

140
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And when I was three, he would back then.

141
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
If you were in uniform, you could ride the train for free

142
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and get the bus for free.

143
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And so he would ride the train in uniform when he had his,

144
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
leave.

145
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And he'd show up at the house and he'd bring me teddy bears.

146
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And I was like, this is obviously the coolest dude ever.

147
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And whatever he does, I want to do it.

148
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And he would tell stories about what he did, you know,

149
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and he was, you know, he was an infantry soldier.

150
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Same regiment that I joined.

151
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And, and that was the seed.

152
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
I assume no one really knows.

153
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
This is just family lore.

154
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Right.

155
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Where, because mom didn't like it.

156
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Dad was a blue collar, auto worker.

157
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
His dad was in the army,

158
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
but it was like conscripted into the Serbian border guard.

159
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
When the, when the, when the German army showed up,

160
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
he basically threw his hands up.

161
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Was like, yep, I'm cool.

162
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Don't shoot.

163
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
You know, mom's dad apparently was in the army,

164
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
but no one knows because he died when she was 10.

165
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
No one's really sure what he did.

166
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
You know, apparently he was in Korea,

167
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
but there's no record of it.

168
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
So, anyway, it's just,

169
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
it was there.

170
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And Jim, I think, was the catalyst.

171
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
That sparked it.

172
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
It sparked it when I was just a young little impressionable boy.

173
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
That happens.

174
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Now, when you've got to be a teenager.

175
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
You know, you kind of sounded in the book.

176
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
You sound like, yes, you sound like a teenager.

177
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Yeah.

178
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And I mean, just to go here in your book,

179
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
you say, I was a loner who didn't fit in.

180
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I still dreamt of being in the army,

181
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
probably because I wanted to belong to something.

182
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Yeah.

183
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And it was definitely clear I didn't belong in school.

184
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I hated school.

185
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I hate, especially because when you get to high school,

186
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and I don't know how you guys,

187
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I've heard you talk a little bit about it.

188
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
It sounded like you had the same issues.

189
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Couldn't connect with any of your teachers.

190
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
The only teacher I remember I had this one teacher.

191
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I forget his name, but he was Scottish originally.

192
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And he was my history teacher.

193
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Like the only subject I cared about was history, really.

194
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And he would tell stories about everything else he ever did in life

195
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
before he was a teacher.

196
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And I was like, okay, this guy actually has some shit

197
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
that I need to hear because he's been around the world

198
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and he's done everything.

199
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
The rest of them.

200
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I joined, I don't know if he came to teach you how to call it.

201
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I didn't know how to type.

202
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And I'd be like, why am I even here?

203
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
What am I doing here?

204
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Doing math?

205
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I, you know, snipers, you know,

206
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
we eat ballistic charts for breakfast.

207
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And math was useless to me in high school.

208
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And yeah, I just delass thing I wanted to be was in school.

209
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And I actually, because this was the 90s, right?

210
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
So that was still when you could quit school to join the army.

211
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And I was like, oh, I'm just going to quit school and join the army.

212
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And my parents, like, basically had to beg me to stay.

213
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
They let me join the reserves, which in Canada is called the militia.

214
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And it's like, once a week and a week and a month.

215
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And they're like, you can do that, but don't quit school.

216
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Finish school.

217
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
All right.

218
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
But it was like completely against my will.

219
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
But they finally got you, they finally let you join.

220
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
You joined the militia.

221
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Right.

222
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And then, but you weren't still in acupuncturne.

223
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Well, the militia in Canada, you can be called up to active duty.

224
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
But it's not like we chatted a little bit about this on the way here where you guys

225
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
have a different system here because yours is much bigger.

226
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.000
But also like the militia in Canada was the military before World War Two, basically.

227
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
So regiments were local.

228
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
It was a part-time thing.

229
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
You know, it was kind of like, it was the what is that?

230
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
What do they call it?

231
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
The citizen soldier.

232
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And the regular army was just there to kind of give them an enemy force and take care of the machine guns and the howitzers.

233
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Like, that doesn't there so that we had at the time.

234
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And it wasn't until after World War Two that it flipped because it was, you know, the Cold War started in all that jazz.

235
00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.000
So, you know, at any time, the regular army now into the 90s could say, you know what?

236
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
We need 10 reserve soldiers to fill in a platoon here.

237
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And if you could volunteer, and I remember when I showed up to my reserve unit, there were sergeants sewing private stripes under their uniform because they were called up to the regular army.

238
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
But you're not a sergeant.

239
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
You're like, you're qualified because to keep guys in the reserves, they promote them fast.

240
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
But when you go work with the regs, like they're not going to call you a sergeant, you've been in as long as corporal Smith.

241
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Uh-huh, private stripes, bitch. But guys, guys would fight each other to get those slots though.

242
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Because there was nothing better, more honorable than to deploy with a reg for his regiment.

243
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Absolutely.

244
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And go, you know, peacekeeping, but you know, there are still a few gun fights here and there.

245
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
I thought this was cool in the book. You talked about this here.

246
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
You're basically starting boot camp.

247
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And you say, you just get your haircut.

248
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Yeah.

249
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Get your head shaved for the first time.

250
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Once the barber was done, I studied myself and his mirror.

251
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I barely recognized the young man staring back at me.

252
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
The eyes were the same, but everything else was different.

253
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I wasn't jody-middick.

254
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Lay about loaner, high school, good for nothing.

255
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Another floundering adolescent with no ambition and no life plan.

256
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
That kid was lying under a pile of hair on the floor.

257
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Looking back at me was jody-middick soldier in training.

258
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I was good boss.

259
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
So legit.

260
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Yeah.

261
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Well, so I had, at the time, lethal weapon, too, was my favorite movie ever.

262
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So I had like attempted.

263
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
You're a straight male Gibson hero.

264
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Oh, dude.

265
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
It was glorious.

266
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Oh, you should have seen it.

267
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Oh, it's next.

268
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

269
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
We've walked around smoking cigarettes and pretend.

270
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Yeah, anyway, just being ridiculous.

271
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
But, you know, it happened to me again recently because I had grown my beard out

272
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and I had a bit of, I had some long hair and I did, I did it.

273
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
I shaved the beard down to nothing and I went to the barber who usually, like,

274
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
does his best to give me a little bit of length, but still make me look professional.

275
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And I said, I want you to give me a number one all around.

276
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
That's what I'm talking about.

277
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And this was just, this was just like a month ago.

278
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And, you know, he did all that.

279
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
You know, your skin feels cold because now the air is on it and I looked in the mirror

280
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and it was almost the same feeling I went, oh, oh, there he is.

281
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
I was like, there's that soldier.

282
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And I remember the feeling because it was the guy's name was Markle.

283
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
He was the Italian guy who cut my hair.

284
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And he couldn't believe it because he had fostered this ridiculous

285
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
mullet for the last two years.

286
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And now I said shave it off because I showed him a picture of a marine.

287
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And I want to look like this guy.

288
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And when he shaved it and then it,

289
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000
it was like, I was at the starting line of like the biggest race I'd ever

290
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
going to run in my life.

291
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And all I could think about was getting to the end and being successful.

292
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And it changed my life, man.

293
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
It changed my life.

294
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Yeah, you know, one thing that, because when I was a kid, you know, I was into,

295
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
this is going a little bit tangential.

296
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
But I was into the hardcore scene on the East Coast.

297
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Yes, hardcore music. That's what I grew up with.

298
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And it was like, yeah, shaved heads, getting after it.

299
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
But one of my best friend at the time, he's like, listen, you know,

300
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
where part of this, where there's nowhere to hide.

301
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
You can't hide behind your bangs.

302
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
It's all right there. You got to face yourself.

303
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Nice.

304
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And it also strips away, you know, any kind of, I mean, hair is basically,

305
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
what's that word?

306
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
It's basically for show.

307
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I mean, what hair is?

308
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
It's just, it won't beなる.

309
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Side.

310
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Because of the hair is, it stands out like normal fashion.

311
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
So, you know, the hair isn't a alchemist.

312
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
It's organized?

313
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
So, you know, I know that I've never actually smoked a shots ever.

314
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
So, I, there is no purpose other than I look good.

315
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So, let's just go ahead and remove that.

316
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
I don't care what I look like.

317
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
I'm here to win.

318
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
So, yeah, I guess that may dissplay my hair cut.

319
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And so.

320
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
But it, um, I'm glad you picked that sight that that paragraph because

321
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
when I did this a month ago is, when I started my training for well,

322
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.20
I know how to eat well. I know how to work out of a workout. I was like 16

323
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.06
But I just wasn't it wasn't clicking you know, and I went the barber and I did that and it was like the switch went off

324
00:15:18.06 --> 00:15:20.86
Boom and there it was. It was like oh I'm back at that starting line

325
00:15:21.60 --> 00:15:27.84
I'm gonna be 40 in January. So I want a six pack before I'm 40. I don't know. So it's like I blown up. I haven't had one

326
00:15:28.44 --> 00:15:30.44
That's been 10 years

327
00:15:31.44 --> 00:15:35.56
Right on all right. So now we get into this next section now you're kind of

328
00:15:35.56 --> 00:15:39.36
Learning about what the army's like and here's some stuff that you said about it

329
00:15:39.36 --> 00:15:45.94
There was a system for everything in the army a way to stand and a way to sit a way to dress and a way to sleep

330
00:15:46.40 --> 00:15:50.88
There's also a way to a system for how to properly eat at the mess hall

331
00:15:51.76 --> 00:15:59.44
Our routine was an endless monotonous cycle. We woke up made our cops folded our sleeping bags in the exact way we'd been taught

332
00:16:00.04 --> 00:16:02.82
Once the tent was in shape it was on the barracks box

333
00:16:02.82 --> 00:16:08.30
Barric boxes we had to lay them out as instructed with everything in its proper place

334
00:16:08.42 --> 00:16:16.02
Whether it made sense or not we had to stand beside our kit and cops everyone perfectly still as the officer did inspection

335
00:16:17.10 --> 00:16:22.04
At the time I thought that so much of this discipline was overkill

336
00:16:22.62 --> 00:16:28.64
Why did we have to stand to detention when the officer was on the other side of the tent looking at some other dudes cotton kit?

337
00:16:28.64 --> 00:16:32.16
Why did our barracks boxes have to be identical?

338
00:16:32.16 --> 00:16:38.44
It took me a couple years to figure out that the skills they were drilling into us are actually really important for a combat leader

339
00:16:38.80 --> 00:16:42.36
If you can't still stand still long enough for morning inspection

340
00:16:42.68 --> 00:16:46.36
How can your commanders trust you to hold your post during a mortar barrage?

341
00:16:46.80 --> 00:16:52.44
How will a leader know he can count on you to be a useful soldier if you can't even follow through on an order

342
00:16:52.44 --> 00:17:00.84
meant to keep you in your comrades safe even if you don't know it at the time all these drills were training me to put self-discipline

343
00:17:01.32 --> 00:17:04.32
above my instinct to flinch or flee

344
00:17:04.92 --> 00:17:09.44
When everything in me told me to break my posture to stand down

345
00:17:09.44 --> 00:17:12.96
I learned to obey a different order instead

346
00:17:12.96 --> 00:17:23.76
It was basic training but I was assimilating some important skills that would later make me a better sniper

347
00:17:24.08 --> 00:17:31.08
Now I talk about discipline all the time and that's obviously why I honed in on this because you kind of captured

348
00:17:31.96 --> 00:17:34.48
The kind of things that they're teaching you discipline

349
00:17:34.96 --> 00:17:41.08
They're teaching you discipline and if you don't make that connection for all you young troopers out there that are getting ready to join the military

350
00:17:41.08 --> 00:17:44.08
There's a purpose there's a reason behind it

351
00:17:49.08 --> 00:17:51.08
A definite purpose

352
00:17:53.08 --> 00:17:57.08
And you know that's part of my book is the book that I wrote with Lave

353
00:17:58.08 --> 00:18:03.08
You know, I just wanted to call this a clinical freedom. There's another chapter in there. It happens to be called cover and move

354
00:18:04.08 --> 00:18:06.08
Yeah, and

355
00:18:06.08 --> 00:18:14.08
You know, we related to everything we do to me. There's no other tactic and again, I had to call this out in your book and by the way, I'm reading your book right now

356
00:18:15.08 --> 00:18:23.08
And I was trying to figure out how to do this. Yeah, like should I say, okay, can you read this section and then I thought to myself

357
00:18:25.08 --> 00:18:27.08
It's going to be different for you to hear it

358
00:18:28.08 --> 00:18:34.08
Coming from someone else to hear the words and when I looked up at you after reading that first section I was like he just enjoyed that

359
00:18:34.08 --> 00:18:35.08
I did

360
00:18:35.08 --> 00:18:44.08
Yeah, because you're hearing it. You can't you can never hear it when you hear yourself read it. You're it's like I don't know I have my own reaction because they're my words

361
00:18:45.08 --> 00:18:50.08
But especially from someone like like you someone who shared

362
00:18:51.08 --> 00:18:53.08
Relatively common experiences

363
00:18:53.08 --> 00:19:08.08
And you know, I was a snab or team leader. You were a you were a task force leader and for us to have a similar reaction to the same types of things is it's very interesting for me to see as well to see someone like

364
00:19:09.08 --> 00:19:17.08
Like, jacco read the same thing that I went through and go, yes, exactly because you got it. It took me a couple years to realize like I said

365
00:19:17.08 --> 00:19:23.08
Why am I standing here? This is stupid. This is because just go out. Let's just go with their entrain what you are training bitch

366
00:19:24.08 --> 00:19:30.08
You're learning how to do what you're told and you're learning how to back because if you take off from your barracks box

367
00:19:31.08 --> 00:19:40.08
Well, guess who's going to pay for it the guy next to you and you know beyond doing what you're told even in that paragraph you pointed out look the the inspectors look in the other direction

368
00:19:40.08 --> 00:19:48.08
You could easily break your posture. Yeah, you know, he's not going to see you. He's never going to catch you, but guess what you held the line. Yeah, you held the line

369
00:19:48.08 --> 00:19:58.08
And that's what you're learning is that no matter what no matter what people are looking at or not you're going to do your job that you're duty right it's your job. It's the job right it's the job and people

370
00:19:59.08 --> 00:20:06.08
What makes a good soldier at someone who understands their job is to be that soldier and I know okay

371
00:20:06.08 --> 00:20:17.08
I know what I'm saying and you know what I'm saying, but you got to go through that to really understand it and me and you can give advice all day to people like new new guys we get

372
00:20:17.08 --> 00:20:25.08
When you tweeted out I was coming oh, I'm getting ready to go on selection. I'm getting ready to go to just I want to be a sniper. I'm joining the infantry. What do I do? What do I do?

373
00:20:25.08 --> 00:20:36.08
I can give you advice all day. Jockel can give you advice all day, but man there's something you just got to learn on your own and that's that standing there with your boots polished at full at you know standing at the child

374
00:20:37.08 --> 00:20:48.08
Wondering why you had to iron your shirt again is going to help you later on when you're under enemy machine gun fire and mortars are coming down trust me. That's just going to help you

375
00:20:49.08 --> 00:20:51.08
But you're going to learn that on your own.

376
00:20:51.08 --> 00:21:06.08
Now back to cover move. Here you go talking about cover move in our pairs one guy would move forward while the other guy would shoot to provide cover the move would yell moving and jump up and move forward about three steps saying it is head up he sees me down

377
00:21:07.08 --> 00:21:15.08
While as partner covered him at down the mover would take cover going to ground taking up a firing position and yelling covering once in position

378
00:21:15.08 --> 00:21:25.08
Then his partner would move forward the same way the idea was to always have a foot on the ground which means one soldier is covering while the other is moving boom

379
00:21:26.08 --> 00:21:31.08
And you said to break that out on your own team at work now in the civilian sector right

380
00:21:32.08 --> 00:21:37.08
Yeah, yeah, we had lunch and the best thing I got out of reading your book

381
00:21:37.08 --> 00:21:48.08
My transition was a weird one. Okay politics is not business, but there are some business aspects and that I am now dealing with people that aren't

382
00:21:49.08 --> 00:21:59.08
You know, I'm used to working in small teams with people that are professionals at what we do you know so snipers and even though that was 10 years ago that's basically my last real working environment

383
00:21:59.08 --> 00:22:10.08
That's what you know is that's what I know so if even if I'm the boss and you're my sniper and I go echo I need you to take up this position I can go away come back that position's taken

384
00:22:11.08 --> 00:22:19.08
But when you're dealing with civilian staff who have never operated in that kind of or we say operated they've never worked in that kind of environment

385
00:22:19.08 --> 00:22:31.08
If I tell them to do something and walk away you better come back and check because they're not used to that kind of freedom because it's discipline but it's you're giving them I'm giving you the freedom to do the job I gave you

386
00:22:32.08 --> 00:22:36.08
You don't need me to double check that you took up the proper sniper position

387
00:22:37.08 --> 00:22:45.08
And then also the fire and the cover and move the foot on the ground I realized after reading your book I went so jocco just

388
00:22:45.08 --> 00:22:53.08
Basically was like listen dummy that's how I felt I felt like a dummy. I'm like of course I should have implemented this in the office

389
00:22:54.08 --> 00:23:00.08
My people were operating in silos because I had my my because I'm the sports commissioner for the city so I had a sports

390
00:23:01.08 --> 00:23:06.08
One of my assistants was on sports one of my assistants was on pop the policy one of my assistants was on

391
00:23:07.08 --> 00:23:11.08
Con constituency work and that's where you deal with the the voters who call it

392
00:23:11.08 --> 00:23:16.08
But none of them were talking to each other and I was only talking to them sporadically

393
00:23:17.08 --> 00:23:18.08
So I said okay guys from

394
00:23:19.08 --> 00:23:25.08
Starting today I didn't tell them why though. I wasn't like I wasn't gonna say hey this guy jocco gave me an idea. I said hey guys. I got an idea

395
00:23:26.08 --> 00:23:33.08
From now on CC you're gonna CC him and you're gonna CC him back whenever you send an email

396
00:23:34.08 --> 00:23:36.08
And then I'm gonna CC you and you're gonna CC me

397
00:23:36.08 --> 00:23:46.08
Within that week our productivity like 100% improvement because now instead of everyone was just aware of what what the others were doing and and their things that

398
00:23:47.08 --> 00:23:48.08
I

399
00:23:48.08 --> 00:23:52.08
Already know but now I got to learn to apply them in my civilian life

400
00:23:53.08 --> 00:23:57.08
Because I'm not working with highly trained snipers anymore. I'm working with people that are good at their jobs

401
00:23:58.08 --> 00:24:02.08
But not necessarily the way that I expect them to be and

402
00:24:02.08 --> 00:24:07.08
It you know there's so much we were talking about it right before we pressed record about

403
00:24:08.08 --> 00:24:16.08
Why is you your the last podcast was the art of war and and and to us it's kind of like a duck you know Joe Rogan says all the time. It's a duh

404
00:24:17.08 --> 00:24:18.08
That's a duh thing but

405
00:24:19.08 --> 00:24:28.08
There's so much you can take from that book and up and there's a reason why fortune 500 CEOs keep it in their desk because it you can apply a lot of what Sun Sioux said

406
00:24:28.08 --> 00:24:40.08
3000 years ago to right now and just your daily life to your interactions with your kids interactions with your your boss or your subordinates or your supplier or your you know your your colleagues

407
00:24:41.08 --> 00:24:44.08
It's all right there. It's just you got a translate it, you know, it's not

408
00:24:45.08 --> 00:24:49.08
Difficult ground. It's you know, it's a position you have to take on an issue

409
00:24:51.08 --> 00:24:52.08
So

410
00:24:52.08 --> 00:25:02.08
Yeah, like I get I get it's a trip to me this whole life this whole thing. It's a it's human nature. Yeah, that that thread of human nature runs through

411
00:25:03.08 --> 00:25:13.08
From 25 hundred years ago, it's on Sioux through war through life through business through the relationships that you now have with your kids. Yeah, it's everywhere

412
00:25:14.08 --> 00:25:15.08
Kid

413
00:25:15.08 --> 00:25:26.08
Now you since you were a militia you actually went back to school after you went to boot camp. Yeah, so you get back to school. This is very typical

414
00:25:27.08 --> 00:25:36.08
Before militia training, I'd been so bored at school and found everything tedious and pointless but after eight weeks of soldier training school seemed like a breeze

415
00:25:36.08 --> 00:25:44.08
I started arriving on time and paying attention to lessons in the military you can direct your career according to your aptitudes and interests

416
00:25:45.08 --> 00:25:53.08
So I decided to do the same at school instead of taking classes I hated I picked ones. I knew I would enjoy my grades improved because I was doing more of what I wanted to do

417
00:25:54.08 --> 00:25:58.08
For the first time I had discipline and self direction

418
00:25:58.08 --> 00:26:09.08
And instead of all that energy being repressed or coming out the wrong way I had focus I went from being a loner and keeping to myself to becoming more outgoing and popular at school

419
00:26:13.08 --> 00:26:15.08
That discipline goes a long way

420
00:26:16.08 --> 00:26:24.08
It really goes along and see I went to college after I'd been in the seal teams for eight years. No, sorry 10 years

421
00:26:24.08 --> 00:26:32.08
So when I went to college I was like, oh, bring it bring it on. I've got to study every little thing you say and I'm going to know it better than you

422
00:26:33.08 --> 00:26:44.08
But I found I was a better student after going through boot camp and basic training and just like learning became easier. Yeah, oh, yeah

423
00:26:45.08 --> 00:26:50.08
Even if I didn't want to know what they were talking about. Yeah, and that's something that the army poses on you is that will teach you something

424
00:26:50.08 --> 00:26:57.08
For the first time you because in civilian world on your kid they go, you got to learn this and you don't study and next thing you know you don't really know it

425
00:26:58.08 --> 00:27:03.08
Then you take the test and you fail and you're like, oh, I'm not smart. I'm going to the army like, no, you will learn this

426
00:27:04.08 --> 00:27:10.08
And then you learn it and you say, oh, okay, that's how I learned I actually have to apply myself and study and now I'm going to get an A

427
00:27:11.08 --> 00:27:17.08
Which is awesome. So then now you still weren't active in the military and you want to get your factory work on

428
00:27:17.08 --> 00:27:26.08
Yeah, well, I was I was as active as I had to be because it's you know, it's part time right, right, and then you know, there was a girl

429
00:27:27.08 --> 00:27:34.08
Just beautiful Russian girlfriend and you know, dad got me a great paying job

430
00:27:35.08 --> 00:27:40.08
But I'll let you say yeah, no, that's that's good and then finally you were like, okay, I'm ready to

431
00:27:40.08 --> 00:27:49.08
I mean you worked in that factory situation for so long that you said I'm going to go well, that's about a year and I was making money that like it was like 25 bucks an hour

432
00:27:50.08 --> 00:28:04.08
I was 19 was a 96 I think and I hated it. I'm sorry dad if you're if you hear this because he got me the job, but it was his parent company because he was an union using the we had the Canadian auto worker

433
00:28:05.08 --> 00:28:07.08
down here with it's the United Auto Workers

434
00:28:07.08 --> 00:28:09.08
and

435
00:28:09.08 --> 00:28:11.08
and

436
00:28:11.08 --> 00:28:19.08
just it just it just it was soul crushing for me for me and nothing against guys I can do it

437
00:28:20.08 --> 00:28:25.08
There are guys that have worked there 30 years. They put the same rivet in over and over and over again for eight hours a day

438
00:28:26.08 --> 00:28:32.08
And they're masters at it and they love it and they punch their card and they go home and they do their thing wasn't for joty

439
00:28:32.08 --> 00:28:51.08
I know so you get back you now you go full active duty. Yes, come yeah you become a soldier by profession right so I I do what we call a transfer to the regular force and then on top of that usually you're supposed to go through training again

440
00:28:52.08 --> 00:28:58.08
depending on your level of experience because I was only both three years so I should have gone through

441
00:28:58.08 --> 00:29:03.08
What what back what's called battle school and that's that's the regular armies

442
00:29:04.08 --> 00:29:09.08
battle school to become an infantry soldier for whatever reason the decision was made that I wouldn't

443
00:29:11.08 --> 00:29:19.08
Okay, so you don't go back in and but you're our back active duty and now you think that joty was all super square to wait now, but you weren't for you

444
00:29:20.08 --> 00:29:23.08
Well, it was a rough transition jocco and

445
00:29:23.08 --> 00:29:27.08
Yeah, that came after

446
00:29:27.08 --> 00:29:35.08
Yeah, we don't you're actually do you right well, yeah, I'm a full time private I was a corporal in the reserves right busted back down to private

447
00:29:36.08 --> 00:29:39.08
Show up there's a lot of politics going on

448
00:29:40.08 --> 00:29:45.08
Right now and at this time because the regular armies being told it has to take reserves

449
00:29:46.08 --> 00:29:51.08
Whereas before it was like if you need them you can take them now it's even if you don't need them

450
00:29:51.08 --> 00:29:53.08
You're going to take 30%

451
00:29:54.08 --> 00:30:02.08
So you have a battalion of infantry guys. Let's say one RCR at full strength is usually at this time. It was about 700

452
00:30:04.08 --> 00:30:17.08
Cut 30% off of active duty good to go guys and now they're put aside and 30% reserve is show up to take their spot out. Yeah, so

453
00:30:17.08 --> 00:30:25.08
That and this was mandated by our headquarters and so the politics within the unit was kind of we're allowed to swear on this right?

454
00:30:26.08 --> 00:30:35.08
Yeah, the red forest guys are all like fuck you and the horse you came in on and and that horse is mom and anybody else associated with that horse

455
00:30:36.08 --> 00:30:42.08
I show up they thought because I was it they thought I was a reserve because the RCR has a reserve battalion

456
00:30:42.08 --> 00:30:55.08
So they thought I was a reserve RCR and then when they found out I was a direct entry which means I go directly from the reserves into the Reg force without going through the RCR battle school

457
00:30:56.08 --> 00:30:59.08
Huh, so they just gave you that cat badge

458
00:31:00.08 --> 00:31:02.08
Well, yeah, but I did basic training in the reserves

459
00:31:03.08 --> 00:31:05.08
Three years ago

460
00:31:05.08 --> 00:31:13.08
Oh, you did huh and I got man it was rough. It was a rough, but it and it got rough because you got in trouble

461
00:31:14.08 --> 00:31:21.08
Yeah, yeah, so I don't know why you by the way just so you know you wrote this in the book that's been published. Yeah acting like this didn't happen

462
00:31:22.08 --> 00:31:29.08
Now's a little bit too late. You got arrested. I did get arrested. I don't trust anyone who hasn't at least been handcuffed. Yeah, that's good point right

463
00:31:29.08 --> 00:31:41.08
I made a mistake so we were now I the preamble to this was that I did eventually get sent to the RCR battles and that's where I did get arrested

464
00:31:42.08 --> 00:31:52.08
Another one of the trainees and I well the whole platoon went out of course being young men. We somehow found ourselves at a gentleman's nightclub

465
00:31:52.08 --> 00:32:01.08
And we were enjoying our evening and one of the guys who decided he wanted to get some cocaine and I was held by 20

466
00:32:02.08 --> 00:32:05.08
I had never even seen this stuff except for in Miami, vice

467
00:32:06.08 --> 00:32:13.08
And I'm like what's the point we're already here. We're having fun. I've already got a few drinks got some girls sitting with us why why leave

468
00:32:14.08 --> 00:32:18.08
And he was adamant so I guess in his civilian life this was something he got got into

469
00:32:18.08 --> 00:32:28.08
And in my mind I was just like okay, so he's gonna like leave on his own and go somewhere where again like in Miami, vice

470
00:32:29.08 --> 00:32:33.08
It's always like the worst part of town. Guess what it was the worst part of town

471
00:32:34.08 --> 00:32:40.08
So I'm like okay, I'm gonna go with you. I don't I don't need any but but I'll be there in case they try to mug your jump. Yeah

472
00:32:40.08 --> 00:32:51.08
Or jump yeah turns out he was buying it from an undercover cop because you know like who else you're gonna buy it off right and then when after they bust us

473
00:32:52.08 --> 00:32:57.08
So we're like walking back to the club and like okay finally right I can get back and start hanging with the girls again

474
00:32:58.08 --> 00:33:05.08
So I get my drink on we get tackled by guys bigger than you and I and like they're the so they're the under the the night guys

475
00:33:05.08 --> 00:33:11.08
And they're like what do you do and you create they look at our idea. You're guys are in the army and you're going to smoke crack and I'm like

476
00:33:12.08 --> 00:33:17.08
What I look at the guy I'm like what's he talking about he's like well I might have

477
00:33:18.08 --> 00:33:22.08
They might not have had any coax I might have bought and I'm like oh my gosh, I'm just like

478
00:33:24.08 --> 00:33:32.08
But now that's the reality of my life right and I can't there's no going back. There's no changing it and it was it was

479
00:33:32.08 --> 00:33:36.08
It was at the time I described it as the worst year of my life

480
00:33:37.08 --> 00:33:42.08
But maybe it was the best the subsequent year because it taught me a lot about myself

481
00:33:43.08 --> 00:33:48.08
Yeah, and that's the main reason why I kind of wanted to tell that yeah, I wanted you to talk about that because

482
00:33:49.08 --> 00:33:52.08
Number one like you said it's a mistake that you made that

483
00:33:53.08 --> 00:34:00.08
You know I've had that feeling to before where you're you're just like okay, this is my reality now. There's no you can't go backwards. You're cuffed

484
00:34:00.08 --> 00:34:02.08
Yeah, and yet

485
00:34:02.08 --> 00:34:08.08
You had you transition from it and in the book here's how you kind of talk about that transition because they're going to send you back to

486
00:34:09.08 --> 00:34:15.08
Meford. What's it meford meford was the battle school? So they're going to send you to the battle school for another crack at it

487
00:34:16.08 --> 00:34:20.08
Your third crack. Well, my second crack at battle school, but my third

488
00:34:21.08 --> 00:34:22.08
Infantry course

489
00:34:23.08 --> 00:34:26.08
So here's what you did and by the way you were teeter tottering this whole time

490
00:34:26.08 --> 00:34:31.08
They don't know if they're going to kick you out they might let you in because just to everybody knows the cops even took your side

491
00:34:31.08 --> 00:34:35.08
And you know they said hey this guy didn't have anything to do with it, but didn't matter the military will sometimes

492
00:34:36.08 --> 00:34:41.08
guilty by association. Yeah, so the the the the the the the police department was like jodie you clearly

493
00:34:42.08 --> 00:34:46.08
Had nothing to do with it, but yeah guilty by association right and so

494
00:34:47.08 --> 00:34:53.08
They go back and forth find the you get orders. Okay. We're going to let you stay in and now you say this. I had two choices

495
00:34:53.08 --> 00:35:02.08
I could be pissed off forever and feel hard done by or I could go back to Meford with a new attitude and make the best of it

496
00:35:03.08 --> 00:35:13.08
I could keep my head high and get off the bus with the shiniest boots the best press uniform the best laid out kit and the best attitude and being the best shape of anybody there

497
00:35:14.08 --> 00:35:17.08
And that's what you did so I did

498
00:35:17.08 --> 00:35:23.08
So anybody that's out there that's listening to this podcast that hit a little bump in the road. That's what you do

499
00:35:25.08 --> 00:35:29.08
You show up with the best attitude the best shape

500
00:35:30.08 --> 00:35:36.08
With your head held high and you get after it extreme ownership you got to own it. Yeah, there's no hiding from it

501
00:35:37.08 --> 00:35:42.08
There's no explaining your way out of it. There's no side no sideways maneuver you're going to make your that guy

502
00:35:42.08 --> 00:35:50.08
I was that guy. Oh, there's that guy. Yeah, so now fast forward a little bit

503
00:35:51.08 --> 00:36:01.08
You deploy now you're now your legit part of the regiment. Yep finally and you deploy to Kosovo which at the time was a real world mission

504
00:36:02.08 --> 00:36:06.08
I'm sure you were fired up. I know I would have been fired. I think go to Kosovo, but I would have been fired up to go to Kosovo

505
00:36:06.08 --> 00:36:15.08
Oh, because it was the only game in town. I still remember when our seat when our commanding officer said he got we gathered up in the parade hall and he said

506
00:36:16.08 --> 00:36:22.08
When our CR is going to Kosovo and I still remember I was, you know, you know, you know, I have it at ease. You got your hand behind your back

507
00:36:23.08 --> 00:36:32.08
My hand went into a fist and I had to stop myself from doing a fist bump. I was like, yeah, you were going to become James Bond Chuck Norris and Rambo all

508
00:36:32.08 --> 00:36:34.08
One moment is going to be glorious

509
00:36:35.08 --> 00:36:43.08
So you go to Kosovo and and you know what we're kind of joking about it, but it was a legit mission at the time there was there was stuff that was happening there

510
00:36:44.08 --> 00:36:53.08
I like this little section here. You got you're talking about the Russians because your station near some Russian folks and you said this we like to think we're tough as Canadians

511
00:36:54.08 --> 00:36:59.08
But it turned out this Russian unit where we're Russian airborne who'd come from the fighting in Cheshnia

512
00:36:59.08 --> 00:37:03.08
And we've gone into some pretty good days talking about Cheshnia. We talked about Cheshnia in here

513
00:37:04.08 --> 00:37:12.08
These guys took things to a whole new level. They were hardcore soldiers. We would complain when our showers weren't giving us warm water

514
00:37:12.08 --> 00:37:19.08
Then we'd look over to the Russian camp and see soldiers outside in minus 25 degrees washing themselves with snow

515
00:37:20.08 --> 00:37:22.08
Or out in t-shirts cutting firewood

516
00:37:22.08 --> 00:37:26.08
These guys were sleeping in a world war two air attempts

517
00:37:26.08 --> 00:37:33.08
While we were sweating inside our heated barracks and every morning they'd be outside in the ball freezing cold running

518
00:37:34.08 --> 00:37:37.08
Doing chin-ups and bench pressing big truck tires

519
00:37:38.08 --> 00:37:46.08
These guys were legit. Yeah, yeah, and we didn't know there is some there was some stuff going on at the

520
00:37:46.08 --> 00:37:50.08
Pristina airport at that time. That's why they were there. Do you remember do you remember this situation at all?

521
00:37:50.08 --> 00:37:56.08
So NATO did its bombing thing, right? Bomb the Syrians out of Kosovo basically

522
00:37:57.08 --> 00:38:03.08
And then it was like okay, so a NATO stabilization for his K4 the Kosovo stable is whatever it was

523
00:38:04.08 --> 00:38:10.08
Was going to move in and you know everyone was going to get a sector British Russian or British Canadian French Bobbubla

524
00:38:10.08 --> 00:38:20.08
Right as we're like loading up on our vehicles that brigade or I don't know how many big it was of Russians just basically showed up

525
00:38:21.08 --> 00:38:25.08
In the middle of the night at the Pristina airport, which was also a military airport

526
00:38:25.08 --> 00:38:33.08
And they set up a perimeter around this like mountain bunker in there which just recently I read an article about it and they were like yeah

527
00:38:33.08 --> 00:38:37.08
Hey guys, it's been however it's been 20 years. This is what was in there

528
00:38:37.08 --> 00:38:45.08
Oh shit. It was full of stuff that shouldn't have been there. So that's that's why everybody was like what are they doing here? Why do they only want to be there?

529
00:38:45.08 --> 00:38:51.08
Because they were like yeah, we're here to help guys. We're just going to be right here in this area. Don't ever come in here or we'll or we'll kill you

530
00:38:51.08 --> 00:38:56.08
But we'll be right here. We're just here to help. Don't big deal. We want to we want to be part of the part of the exercise

531
00:38:57.08 --> 00:39:05.08
But they were there to guard this this like bunker and there is like a lot of there is like I guess there is some nuclear biological weapons in there and and some migs

532
00:39:05.08 --> 00:39:14.08
That should never have been in that part of Europe apparently and in the middle of the night you'd hear planes taking off and nobody knew what they were

533
00:39:17.08 --> 00:39:22.08
But you know nothing really of substantial events happened in Kosovo

534
00:39:22.08 --> 00:39:27.08
You get home from that and this is when you get the opportunity to go to sniper training, which is

535
00:39:27.08 --> 00:39:33.08
You know outstanding and and I thought you did a great job here of pointing out what a

536
00:39:33.08 --> 00:39:42.08
Snipers because people have little ideas in their heads about what a sniper is and here's jodys version of what a sniper is a

537
00:39:43.08 --> 00:39:48.08
True sniper is someone who's willing to do pretty much anything to accomplish the mission

538
00:39:49.08 --> 00:39:55.08
The sniper has a particular mindset and shooting is actually one of the easier parts of the role

539
00:39:55.08 --> 00:40:09.08
I've seen men at the rifle range who are amazing marksmen, but who would be terrible snipers because they don't have the patience they lack the ability to deny their own needs and to put the mission first

540
00:40:10.08 --> 00:40:15.08
A true sniper will make himself uncomfortable just to make the shot

541
00:40:18.08 --> 00:40:24.08
That is something so true the guys think that the that what a sniper is someone that shoots really well

542
00:40:24.08 --> 00:40:34.08
Yeah, that's that's the least that's the easiest thing I can teach you right if I need you to be a sniper that's the easiest thing I can get you to do you know the movie shooter

543
00:40:35.08 --> 00:40:40.08
With our buddy Mark Wahlberg there. I have not seen it. It's based on a book about

544
00:40:40.08 --> 00:40:53.08
A Vietnam era sniper or something but anyway, he takes this like guy who just teams up with them for the movie and he makes them the shooter like the the he teaches him how to shoot because that's the easy per

545
00:40:53.08 --> 00:40:59.08
All that other stuff I talk about that's the part I'm looking for that's what I'm looking for in a sniper

546
00:41:00.08 --> 00:41:09.08
You can shoot all day. I could put you on the range and you could shoot bulls eyes from 900 meters all day as long as you got your gatorade as long as you get your 10 minute break

547
00:41:09.08 --> 00:41:11.08
As long as you get up and go pee pee

548
00:41:11.64 --> 00:41:13.64
But what if I don't let you do any of that stuff

549
00:41:14.56 --> 00:41:21.28
Then what oh is it sunny out on less too bad. Yeah, it's sunny out. Well, it's always it gonna rain. Yep. Don't get up

550
00:41:22.08 --> 00:41:26.08
Your target might come up, but what if there's ants crawling and biting your eyes?

551
00:41:27.24 --> 00:41:34.08
The eyes is problematic. I would it I would allow you to scratch the answer to your eyes, but but your target might come up while you're scratching

552
00:41:34.08 --> 00:41:36.08
It

553
00:41:36.08 --> 00:41:38.08
I wouldn't get up if I was you the

554
00:41:38.08 --> 00:41:44.08
All the sniper courses definitely you talk about in the book you talk about stalking and that's something that no one I haven't seen that movie

555
00:41:44.08 --> 00:41:49.08
But no one really understands the difficulty and the challenging and the self discipline

556
00:41:49.08 --> 00:41:52.08
It's an exercise to self self discipline to crawl

557
00:41:52.08 --> 00:42:05.08
You know one meter every 10 minutes it's hard to get to position where you can see your target take the shot because you have to yeah because you have to have the patience to and the mindset to like

558
00:42:07.08 --> 00:42:12.08
I don't know if it made it into the book. I can't I know you should know your own book, but I

559
00:42:12.08 --> 00:42:19.08
Remember as leopard crawling with a guy and we were on it wasn't even a sniper thing. It was just like a feel like a like a

560
00:42:19.08 --> 00:42:27.08
Field craft thing so we were learning how to just stalk just as soldiers and we were we were side by side, but he was literally on an elevation

561
00:42:27.08 --> 00:42:30.08
Maybe four inches higher than me

562
00:42:31.08 --> 00:42:35.08
I remember I was looking at him and I was like, I just that's not a good spot to be yes

563
00:42:36.08 --> 00:42:40.58
Freeze boom Walker came over God. I was it. I was in direct line of sight

564
00:42:41.08 --> 00:42:46.08
But I was just that four inches lower. You got to like have the patience to look at the ground and go

565
00:42:46.08 --> 00:42:51.08
I'm going to go this way even though it's out of your way because you can't be with insight of

566
00:42:52.08 --> 00:42:56.08
Of the spotters or of the enemy and that guy went on to become

567
00:42:57.08 --> 00:43:01.08
Our tier he joined our tier one unit. He's a he's a JTF guy

568
00:43:02.08 --> 00:43:10.08
But I remember at that time it's so it's not like he was a dummy area and and and we're might have learned a value of the lesson. He probably learned a lesson, but but that's the

569
00:43:10.08 --> 00:43:16.08
Mind said I'm looking for from day one from a guy that I'm going to put through sniper school because we don't we don't have a lot of numbers in Canada

570
00:43:17.08 --> 00:43:21.08
You know like I was telling you at any given time there might be a hundred and fifty maybe a hundred and eighty

571
00:43:22.08 --> 00:43:29.08
Snipers active at any time in the forces and that might and that you know if you add in our tier one tier two guys or maybe there's 200

572
00:43:30.08 --> 00:43:35.08
So I don't have time to to go looking for the best guys, you know

573
00:43:35.08 --> 00:43:41.08
You have to come you basically got to come to us and and so I'm looking for the patient

574
00:43:42.08 --> 00:43:46.08
I'm looking for the guy who's going to take that extra five minutes and look at the ground

575
00:43:47.08 --> 00:43:53.08
He's who's not going to when I tell him okay, you can go go start stalking who's going to sit there for another five ten minutes lose that time

576
00:43:54.08 --> 00:43:56.08
But study the route on his map

577
00:43:56.08 --> 00:44:02.08
You know because it's easy to start run and then you go oh man, I shouldn't know where I'm going and

578
00:44:02.08 --> 00:44:05.08
No, no time spent on the map is time saved on the ground

579
00:44:06.08 --> 00:44:16.08
Right and you so you're looking for that guy and there's just it's a it's probably the same with seals you just you don't it's hard to describe but you know it when you see it

580
00:44:18.08 --> 00:44:20.08
So you get done with sniper school

581
00:44:21.08 --> 00:44:24.08
You spend some more time and then

582
00:44:25.08 --> 00:44:29.08
September 11 happens game on and

583
00:44:29.08 --> 00:44:32.08
And the opportunity comes up

584
00:44:33.08 --> 00:44:41.08
For you to go and deployment now you'd already been through sniper school you were a sniper, but the opportunity there's no opportunity for sniper deploy what they need is a driver

585
00:44:42.08 --> 00:44:44.08
right which

586
00:44:45.08 --> 00:44:46.08
A driver slash

587
00:44:47.08 --> 00:44:55.08
Security yeah, which is which is I mean it's definitely a dangerous job. It's definitely a monotonous job. It's not it's not a glorious job by any stretch

588
00:44:55.08 --> 00:45:01.08
But and also what's rough about being a drivers you have a lot less control over your own fate

589
00:45:02.08 --> 00:45:07.08
I mean you're basically in a defensive situation when you're driving in a convoy you're in defensive situation. That's all that is to it

590
00:45:08.08 --> 00:45:11.08
So here you are you get your target. Yeah, your target. You've been trained to be the hunter

591
00:45:12.08 --> 00:45:18.08
And now you get an offer to go on deployment to be the hunted base as a driver and of course because your

592
00:45:18.08 --> 00:45:25.08
A warrior you say oh, you need a driver. You don't need a sniper, but I'm going to go to Afghanistan

593
00:45:26.08 --> 00:45:31.08
All right, bring it on. Yeah, that was it. It was stay home or be a driver

594
00:45:33.08 --> 00:45:41.08
Pretty easy. So get this pretty simple. So now you were trying what were these little deep you drive it out this so it's

595
00:45:41.08 --> 00:45:43.08
It's

596
00:45:43.08 --> 00:45:54.32
What do you guys got that's comparable nothing? Um, do you just like a little land rover type vehicle? Yeah, but it's like not even like it's it's it's almost a class of its own is it

597
00:45:55.08 --> 00:45:57.08
No, it's like a little

598
00:45:58.08 --> 00:46:04.08
Dune buggy looking thing it had like a four cylinder engine build originally by Volkswagen

599
00:46:04.08 --> 00:46:10.08
We they were roughly the same like look as a original willys Jeep

600
00:46:11.08 --> 00:46:18.08
But that's where the similarities ended and you get to Afghanistan and you're you're drive where are you?

601
00:46:19.08 --> 00:46:26.08
Kabul that was Kabul. And so you're driving people around the city. Yeah from base to wherever they got to go from the airport to our main base, which was

602
00:46:28.08 --> 00:46:30.08
Was the name of that camp again

603
00:46:30.08 --> 00:46:37.08
I'm sorry, I forget the main camp we had in Afghanistan, but it was between the King and Queen's palace got it and

604
00:46:39.08 --> 00:46:42.08
Yeah, they'd go there or because it was

605
00:46:43.08 --> 00:46:51.08
Officers and liaison officers mostly that we worked with right it so it'd be like goliies on with the Turkish guys goliies on with the Germans goliies on with this Afghan war lord

606
00:46:52.08 --> 00:46:57.08
You'd sit around ways. Yeah, yeah, basically and we'd be as bodyguards when he was there and stuff and

607
00:46:57.08 --> 00:47:07.08
And like we said there's a threat. You you obviously were prepared for anything of course, but you know, there wasn't a super high threat

608
00:47:08.08 --> 00:47:10.08
Right, however

609
00:47:11.08 --> 00:47:15.08
There's always a threat and I'm going to the book here

610
00:47:17.08 --> 00:47:21.08
The eldest jeeps were not designed to withstand an attack

611
00:47:21.08 --> 00:47:29.08
This fact became starkly apparent when three three RCR guys were driving to Eltis and hit a land mine

612
00:47:30.08 --> 00:47:37.08
Two of them sergeant Robert short and corporal Rob Beer and Fenger died immediately

613
00:47:38.08 --> 00:47:43.08
And the driver TJ Sterling a friend of mine survived though he was injured

614
00:47:44.08 --> 00:47:48.08
After the incident TJ was brought to the hospital at camp warehouse

615
00:47:48.08 --> 00:47:51.08
And me and another one of the guys from the regiment went to see him

616
00:47:52.08 --> 00:47:55.08
This was the first time I'd seen one of our guys hit by a land mind

617
00:47:56.08 --> 00:48:00.08
In fact, it was the first time I'd seen a casualty at all

618
00:48:01.08 --> 00:48:06.08
TJ was pretty banged up a couple of teeth were broken and he may have had a broken draw

619
00:48:07.08 --> 00:48:09.08
He had laceration's all over

620
00:48:09.08 --> 00:48:14.08
There's always a particular odor in the hospitals around people of suffered traumatic injuries

621
00:48:14.08 --> 00:48:19.08
I remember smelling that odor like blood or maybe just what I thought blood smelled like

622
00:48:20.08 --> 00:48:22.08
TJ was on a stretcher with big wheels

623
00:48:23.08 --> 00:48:25.08
We'd use this kind of stretcher before in training

624
00:48:26.08 --> 00:48:29.08
To me it was a kind of prop

625
00:48:30.08 --> 00:48:32.08
This thing we used for simulations

626
00:48:33.08 --> 00:48:35.08
But this was not a simulation

627
00:48:36.08 --> 00:48:37.08
This was the real thing

628
00:48:38.08 --> 00:48:40.08
TJ was still in shock

629
00:48:40.08 --> 00:48:44.08
It had taken a few hours for him to be extracted from the scene of the explosion

630
00:48:45.08 --> 00:48:49.08
Shorty and beer and Fenger are gone he said

631
00:48:50.08 --> 00:48:52.08
Yeah man, we replied, we heard

632
00:48:53.08 --> 00:48:56.08
I need a smoke man, I need a smoke TJ said

633
00:48:57.08 --> 00:49:00.08
The doctors and nurses wouldn't allow it but as soon as they were out of the vicinity

634
00:49:01.08 --> 00:49:03.08
We lit a cigarette for TJ and gave him a couple of drags

635
00:49:05.08 --> 00:49:07.08
That's way better thanks

636
00:49:07.08 --> 00:49:10.08
We stayed in Chadwick, TJ about some

637
00:49:11.08 --> 00:49:15.08
In consequential things trying to keep a fellow royal in a good state of mind

638
00:49:16.08 --> 00:49:19.08
For me personally, I was learning from what was happening

639
00:49:20.08 --> 00:49:23.08
Facing the reality that when things go wrong

640
00:49:24.08 --> 00:49:26.08
You have to get that smell in your nostrils

641
00:49:27.08 --> 00:49:29.08
And look those sights right in the eye

642
00:49:30.08 --> 00:49:34.08
Sadly, a few years later, TJ ended up taking his own life

643
00:49:34.08 --> 00:49:37.08
I was a Paul Barrett as funeral

644
00:49:38.08 --> 00:49:41.08
And as I carried his coffin, I wondered if he carried guilt

645
00:49:42.08 --> 00:49:45.08
For being the lone survivor in that incident

646
00:49:45.08 --> 00:49:47.08
So really to me, that's like you're welcome to war

647
00:49:48.08 --> 00:49:49.08
Yeah

648
00:49:52.08 --> 00:49:53.08
And

649
00:49:54.08 --> 00:49:57.08
And

650
00:49:57.08 --> 00:50:04.08
Yeah

651
00:50:05.08 --> 00:50:09.08
When you talked about getting that smell in your nostrils

652
00:50:10.08 --> 00:50:12.08
And looking those sights right in the eyes

653
00:50:13.08 --> 00:50:15.08
That's how I think it's important for people to remember

654
00:50:16.08 --> 00:50:18.08
You know when things are bad

655
00:50:19.08 --> 00:50:21.08
Some people want to deny that it's happening

656
00:50:21.08 --> 00:50:25.08
They want to hold their nose and shield their eyes from it

657
00:50:25.08 --> 00:50:27.08
Wrong answer

658
00:50:27.08 --> 00:50:29.08
Breathe it in

659
00:50:29.08 --> 00:50:31.08
Yeah, and our gig, especially

660
00:50:32.08 --> 00:50:33.08
Breathe it in

661
00:50:34.08 --> 00:50:35.08
You have to

662
00:50:36.08 --> 00:50:37.08
That

663
00:50:38.08 --> 00:50:39.08
You have

664
00:50:40.08 --> 00:50:42.08
And our line of work, that's the norm

665
00:50:43.08 --> 00:50:45.08
And I'll tell you, I haven't working with

666
00:50:46.08 --> 00:50:51.08
Worked with a bunch of different companies and bunch of different industries

667
00:50:51.08 --> 00:50:54.08
They run into these situations too

668
00:50:54.08 --> 00:50:56.08
Where their company is going to fail or there's a problem

669
00:50:57.08 --> 00:50:58.08
There's things go wrong

670
00:50:59.08 --> 00:51:00.08
And no, you know what?

671
00:51:01.08 --> 00:51:03.08
Lives are not at stake and I say this all the time

672
00:51:03.08 --> 00:51:04.08
But livelihoods are

673
00:51:04.08 --> 00:51:06.08
And if you're the CEO of a company, you're going to have to now lay off

674
00:51:07.08 --> 00:51:09.08
500 people, 1000 people, 3 people

675
00:51:10.08 --> 00:51:13.08
And now that person is not going to be able to afford their mortgage or pay for their kids

676
00:51:13.08 --> 00:51:14.08
Or get food on the table

677
00:51:15.08 --> 00:51:16.08
That is serious business

678
00:51:16.08 --> 00:51:18.08
You're ruining someone's life

679
00:51:18.08 --> 00:51:22.08
And if you want to shield your eyes at that moment

680
00:51:23.08 --> 00:51:26.08
And you want to hold your nose so you don't have to smell it, you're wrong

681
00:51:27.08 --> 00:51:28.08
Yeah

682
00:51:29.08 --> 00:51:32.08
And obviously this too here for TJ

683
00:51:36.08 --> 00:51:40.08
This is, you know, we're talking about the psychological wounds that people get

684
00:51:40.08 --> 00:51:43.08
Yeah, which for him more worse than his physical wounds

685
00:51:43.08 --> 00:51:44.08
Yeah

686
00:51:44.08 --> 00:51:46.08
I remember one time after I got hit

687
00:51:46.08 --> 00:51:49.08
Because he actually came back with us

688
00:51:50.08 --> 00:51:52.08
And it was six on the tour I was wounded on

689
00:51:53.08 --> 00:51:55.08
And he stayed in the talk the whole time

690
00:51:56.08 --> 00:51:59.08
But I remember we were back and I was hit

691
00:52:00.08 --> 00:52:02.08
And we were at his house and we're having a little bit of a party

692
00:52:03.08 --> 00:52:07.08
And he was crying because he couldn't believe that he, because he got

693
00:52:08.08 --> 00:52:11.08
He was wounded and he got a monthly stipend for his injuries

694
00:52:12.08 --> 00:52:14.08
And he was still active doing and stuff

695
00:52:14.08 --> 00:52:19.08
And when I wound it we had a new veterans system come in

696
00:52:19.08 --> 00:52:21.08
Where I just got like a lump sum payment

697
00:52:22.08 --> 00:52:25.08
And he was crying about how is it that he can get this money

698
00:52:26.08 --> 00:52:29.08
But I only get this money and Joey, what happened to you is so much worse

699
00:52:30.08 --> 00:52:33.08
And what happened to me and I was, why you worried about it

700
00:52:34.08 --> 00:52:36.08
I'm okay man, I'm alive, we're here having some drinks

701
00:52:37.08 --> 00:52:41.08
But he was so tore up inside about what happened to me

702
00:52:41.08 --> 00:52:45.08
And he happened to me versus what happened to him, what happened to Shorty and Baron finger

703
00:52:46.08 --> 00:52:48.08
And he just carried that

704
00:52:49.08 --> 00:52:52.08
And you hear about that survivor's guilt thing

705
00:52:53.08 --> 00:52:56.08
And you don't realize how real it is till you see it

706
00:52:57.08 --> 00:53:00.08
And even after I got wounded when I came home

707
00:53:01.08 --> 00:53:03.08
I felt like shit because my boys were still back there

708
00:53:04.08 --> 00:53:06.08
And then when they went back in 2010

709
00:53:07.08 --> 00:53:09.08
Because our unit rotated back into theater

710
00:53:09.08 --> 00:53:12.08
It killed me, I was dying inside

711
00:53:13.08 --> 00:53:16.08
Those are my guys, you know, they're over there without me

712
00:53:17.08 --> 00:53:19.08
And I'm letting them down because I told them I was going back with them

713
00:53:20.08 --> 00:53:22.08
I said don't worry guys, I'll get better I'll go back

714
00:53:23.08 --> 00:53:25.08
And I had to like really come to grips with that

715
00:53:26.08 --> 00:53:28.08
And you know, TJ couldn't

716
00:53:30.08 --> 00:53:32.08
We lose too many guys that's to that stuff

717
00:53:33.08 --> 00:53:36.08
But I've all, I don't know, I never had those thoughts

718
00:53:36.08 --> 00:53:39.08
But I never thought of ending my own life ever

719
00:53:40.08 --> 00:53:42.08
But I've known enough guys that have done it

720
00:53:43.08 --> 00:53:46.08
That clearly it becomes an option to some people

721
00:53:47.08 --> 00:53:50.08
And I'm at the point with it because it just happened

722
00:53:51.08 --> 00:53:56.08
Maybe a month ago with a guy I worked with in the Green Braise

723
00:53:57.08 --> 00:54:00.08
And I just don't think we can save them all

724
00:54:00.08 --> 00:54:05.08
I don't know if any of you are guy, I mean I think I texted you when it happened

725
00:54:06.08 --> 00:54:07.08
You did, you texted me

726
00:54:08.08 --> 00:54:12.08
And I want to really, my wife, Alana, she's never seen me cry

727
00:54:13.08 --> 00:54:15.08
And I cried that night for Johnny

728
00:54:16.08 --> 00:54:19.08
And it was because we thought we had him

729
00:54:20.08 --> 00:54:23.08
He was living at one of the guys, how he said was on the team that we worked with

730
00:54:24.08 --> 00:54:27.08
He had a girlfriend and things were looking good

731
00:54:27.08 --> 00:54:31.08
And you know, I've had to come to the conclusion

732
00:54:32.08 --> 00:54:36.08
In my own mind that we're not going to save them all

733
00:54:37.08 --> 00:54:40.08
And this is a side effect of the life we chose

734
00:54:41.08 --> 00:54:43.08
That some of our comrades are going to go that direction

735
00:54:44.08 --> 00:54:47.08
And if I was to dwell on it the way TJ did

736
00:54:48.08 --> 00:54:50.08
Then I would become like TJ and I can't afford to do that

737
00:54:51.08 --> 00:54:53.08
You know, use the word Dwell

738
00:54:53.08 --> 00:54:56.08
And that's a word that I use as well

739
00:54:57.08 --> 00:55:00.08
I use the word Dwell and I always say

740
00:55:01.08 --> 00:55:03.08
That you got to face these things

741
00:55:04.08 --> 00:55:06.08
You got to understand these things

742
00:55:06.08 --> 00:55:08.08
You got to actually embrace these things

743
00:55:09.08 --> 00:55:11.08
You got to bring them in but you can't to well on them

744
00:55:12.08 --> 00:55:12.08
That's right

745
00:55:13.08 --> 00:55:14.08
And I think that's the key

746
00:55:15.08 --> 00:55:18.08
Is to, is honestly to do what you said

747
00:55:19.08 --> 00:55:20.08
Is to breathe it in

748
00:55:20.08 --> 00:55:22.08
So look it in the eye

749
00:55:23.08 --> 00:55:24.08
Deal with it

750
00:55:25.08 --> 00:55:26.08
Don't stay there

751
00:55:27.08 --> 00:55:28.08
That's right, move on

752
00:55:29.08 --> 00:55:31.08
Accept it as a consequence of the actions you've chosen

753
00:55:32.08 --> 00:55:33.08
And move on to the next step

754
00:55:34.08 --> 00:55:36.08
Otherwise, you'll be that guy

755
00:55:37.08 --> 00:55:39.08
Talking about that high school football pass that you caught

756
00:55:40.08 --> 00:55:42.08
It's an analogy that fits here

757
00:55:43.08 --> 00:55:45.08
Because we talked about this in your car

758
00:55:46.08 --> 00:55:46.08
There's some guys

759
00:55:46.08 --> 00:55:50.08
I was a neighbor, I was a Navi seal, I was a paratrooper, I was a machine gunner

760
00:55:51.08 --> 00:55:54.08
Whatever it is, I was a jitsu black belt, whatever it is

761
00:55:55.08 --> 00:55:56.08
And that's where they're stuck

762
00:55:57.08 --> 00:55:59.08
That's where they're dwelling there in purgatory

763
00:56:00.08 --> 00:56:03.08
And that whatever ring of hell you want to call it

764
00:56:04.08 --> 00:56:05.08
Stuck in that moment

765
00:56:06.08 --> 00:56:07.08
And you got to move on

766
00:56:08.08 --> 00:56:10.08
You can't dwell because that's where you're going to die when you dwell

767
00:56:11.08 --> 00:56:12.08
It really simply

768
00:56:13.08 --> 00:56:14.08
What you got to do

769
00:56:14.08 --> 00:56:16.08
It's you got to just take a step

770
00:56:17.08 --> 00:56:19.08
Got to take that step forward

771
00:56:20.08 --> 00:56:22.08
You got to look, you got to look it in the eyes

772
00:56:23.08 --> 00:56:25.08
Then you got to walk away

773
00:56:26.08 --> 00:56:28.08
And you got to walk forward and move forward

774
00:56:29.08 --> 00:56:31.08
And make some make go in another direction

775
00:56:32.08 --> 00:56:32.08
Go forward

776
00:56:33.08 --> 00:56:33.08
Yeah

777
00:56:34.08 --> 00:56:35.08
Don't go backwards, go forward

778
00:56:36.08 --> 00:56:38.08
And the other part is accept

779
00:56:39.08 --> 00:56:41.08
That maybe you can't change things

780
00:56:41.08 --> 00:56:44.08
You can't change what's happened in the past

781
00:56:45.08 --> 00:56:46.08
You cannot do that

782
00:56:47.08 --> 00:56:48.08
It happened

783
00:56:49.08 --> 00:56:52.08
And you're not going to change it

784
00:56:53.08 --> 00:56:54.08
So what are you going to do?

785
00:56:55.08 --> 00:56:56.08
Are you going to let it drag you down?

786
00:56:57.08 --> 00:56:58.08
Are you going to dwell on it forever?

787
00:56:59.08 --> 00:57:00.08
Don't do that

788
00:57:01.08 --> 00:57:02.08
I know it gets a hold of you

789
00:57:03.08 --> 00:57:04.08
I know it's a tough one

790
00:57:05.08 --> 00:57:07.08
But deal with it

791
00:57:07.08 --> 00:57:10.08
Accept that you can't change it

792
00:57:11.08 --> 00:57:12.08
Accept that you're here for a reason

793
00:57:13.08 --> 00:57:14.08
To do something

794
00:57:15.08 --> 00:57:17.08
You have the opportunity that maybe your buddies didn't get

795
00:57:18.08 --> 00:57:19.08
They didn't get, never mind

796
00:57:20.08 --> 00:57:21.08
You have an opportunity that your buddies did not get

797
00:57:22.08 --> 00:57:26.08
You think they would want to have you kill yourself?

798
00:57:27.08 --> 00:57:29.08
No, they'd want you to live

799
00:57:30.08 --> 00:57:32.08
But that's what you need to do

800
00:57:33.08 --> 00:57:35.08
Honor them

801
00:57:35.08 --> 00:57:39.08
By living a awesome life every day

802
00:57:40.08 --> 00:57:41.08
Make the change, be the difference

803
00:57:42.08 --> 00:57:44.08
You can't change the world

804
00:57:45.08 --> 00:57:47.08
But you could change somebody else's day

805
00:57:48.08 --> 00:57:51.08
You can be the positive influence in your little tiny sphere

806
00:57:52.08 --> 00:57:55.08
My influence in the world, yours, echoes

807
00:57:56.08 --> 00:57:57.08
It's not the world

808
00:57:58.08 --> 00:57:59.08
But it makes someone else happy

809
00:58:00.08 --> 00:58:03.08
You can be the difference between a good day and a bad day for someone

810
00:58:03.08 --> 00:58:07.08
When I decided that I was going to try and become an officer in the sealed teams

811
00:58:08.08 --> 00:58:10.08
Part of that, part of my decision

812
00:58:11.08 --> 00:58:13.08
I was going to be an admiral or whatever

813
00:58:14.08 --> 00:58:16.08
And I said, you know what?

814
00:58:17.08 --> 00:58:19.08
Because I had a prior and listed officer that was just made our lives

815
00:58:20.08 --> 00:58:21.08
Awesome because he was such a great guy

816
00:58:22.08 --> 00:58:23.08
I said to myself, you know what?

817
00:58:24.08 --> 00:58:25.08
I might not change the world

818
00:58:26.08 --> 00:58:28.08
But I'm going to have a cool sealed pool two in one day

819
00:58:29.08 --> 00:58:30.08
Those guys are going to be fired up

820
00:58:30.08 --> 00:58:32.08
And we're going to kick ass

821
00:58:33.08 --> 00:58:34.08
Just my little world

822
00:58:35.08 --> 00:58:35.08
Just that little thing

823
00:58:36.08 --> 00:58:38.08
And no matter where you are, you got that little world

824
00:58:39.08 --> 00:58:40.08
Maybe like you said, maybe it's one of the person

825
00:58:41.08 --> 00:58:42.08
Maybe it's just yourself

826
00:58:43.08 --> 00:58:45.08
But you make that little part of your world a little bit better

827
00:58:46.08 --> 00:58:48.08
You wake up in the morning

828
00:58:49.08 --> 00:58:52.08
I firmly believe you decide how that day is going to go

829
00:58:53.08 --> 00:58:53.08
Absolutely

830
00:58:54.08 --> 00:58:57.08
I missed my flight to come down

831
00:58:57.08 --> 00:58:59.08
I should have been here yesterday, I missed my flight

832
00:59:00.08 --> 00:59:01.08
I owned that

833
00:59:02.08 --> 00:59:04.08
I had a bad morning

834
00:59:05.08 --> 00:59:07.08
And I was, I think I was even on the phone with you

835
00:59:08.08 --> 00:59:09.08
And I said, yeah, extreme ownership

836
00:59:10.08 --> 00:59:11.08
My fault

837
00:59:12.08 --> 00:59:15.08
And you giggled at me and you said, yep, own it, whatever

838
00:59:18.08 --> 00:59:21.08
And then I might get my one assistant called me

839
00:59:22.08 --> 00:59:23.08
And I said, you know what?

840
00:59:24.08 --> 00:59:25.08
I'm done being pissed off

841
00:59:25.08 --> 00:59:29.08
You know, because I can't, I'm not going to let this one thing ruin the rest of my day

842
00:59:30.08 --> 00:59:30.08
And the rest of my weekend

843
00:59:31.08 --> 00:59:32.08
How's that helping you move forward?

844
00:59:33.08 --> 00:59:34.08
How's that helping the rest of your day?

845
00:59:35.08 --> 00:59:35.08
How's that helping you get here right now?

846
00:59:36.08 --> 00:59:36.08
Doesn't help anything

847
00:59:37.08 --> 00:59:39.08
That doesn't mean that doesn't mean be a robot either though

848
00:59:40.08 --> 00:59:40.08
No

849
00:59:41.08 --> 00:59:42.08
Deal with it, process it

850
00:59:43.08 --> 00:59:43.08
Don't get me wrong

851
00:59:44.08 --> 00:59:45.08
I was really mad yesterday morning

852
00:59:46.08 --> 00:59:47.08
And it takes a lot

853
00:59:48.08 --> 00:59:49.08
He's waiting for you down here

854
00:59:50.08 --> 00:59:53.08
Oh, well, I'm like, I've all the things to be laid for

855
00:59:53.08 --> 00:59:56.08
Yeah, that's right, a guy like, you want a guy like Jocco to think you're a shit

856
00:59:57.08 --> 00:59:58.08
You know, you're plug and can't make a timing

857
00:59:59.08 --> 01:00:00.08
But

858
01:00:01.08 --> 01:00:03.08
You know, everything's gonna be okay

859
01:00:04.08 --> 01:00:06.08
I'm here, we're still doing the podcast

860
01:00:07.08 --> 01:00:08.08
It's beautiful weather

861
01:00:09.08 --> 01:00:10.08
I got to see my kids, I got to pick them up from school

862
01:00:11.08 --> 01:00:12.08
Because I didn't think I was gonna

863
01:00:13.08 --> 01:00:15.08
I got to, you know, I got to see some friends

864
01:00:16.08 --> 01:00:16.08
Walk the dogs that day

865
01:00:17.08 --> 01:00:19.08
But I made that decision myself though

866
01:00:20.08 --> 01:00:21.08
I was sitting on the edge of the bed

867
01:00:21.08 --> 01:00:23.08
I didn't have my prosthetically exon yet

868
01:00:24.08 --> 01:00:26.08
And I said, okay, you're pissed off, now you're done

869
01:00:27.08 --> 01:00:29.08
And I got up and I carried on with the day because

870
01:00:30.08 --> 01:00:33.08
And I, okay, it's easy to say

871
01:00:35.08 --> 01:00:36.08
What's easy for us to say

872
01:00:37.08 --> 01:00:39.08
Take that step, don't dwell, move on

873
01:00:40.08 --> 01:00:43.08
But I firmly believe if you decide

874
01:00:44.08 --> 01:00:47.08
You can change your circumstance

875
01:00:48.08 --> 01:00:49.08
That's a decision you have to make in your own mind

876
01:00:49.08 --> 01:00:51.08
I firmly believe it

877
01:00:52.08 --> 01:00:53.08
And it might not feel like it today

878
01:00:54.08 --> 01:00:55.08
But try again tomorrow

879
01:00:56.08 --> 01:00:57.08
And then try again the next day

880
01:00:58.08 --> 01:00:59.08
And you know what call me

881
01:01:00.08 --> 01:01:02.08
Before you make any decisions

882
01:01:03.08 --> 01:01:04.08
Just please just call me first

883
01:01:05.08 --> 01:01:07.08
If you have Jocco's number call him

884
01:01:08.08 --> 01:01:11.08
Because the world is definitely better with you here

885
01:01:12.08 --> 01:01:13.08
Than without you

886
01:01:14.08 --> 01:01:16.08
And I hate to keep hammering this nail

887
01:01:16.08 --> 01:01:20.08
But it's just a theme that I'm tired of here

888
01:01:21.08 --> 01:01:23.08
A buddy of mine, another sniper had a heart attack

889
01:01:24.08 --> 01:01:26.08
Not long after

890
01:01:27.08 --> 01:01:28.08
That guy killed himself

891
01:01:29.08 --> 01:01:31.08
He's a great dude, he's a legend in the Canadian sniper world

892
01:01:32.08 --> 01:01:35.08
And he was diabetic and he smoked a thousand cigarettes a day

893
01:01:36.08 --> 01:01:37.08
And drank a million beers a week

894
01:01:38.08 --> 01:01:41.08
And they said the heart attack was so fast

895
01:01:42.08 --> 01:01:43.08
He probably was because they found him in bed

896
01:01:43.08 --> 01:01:45.08
He was crawling into bed and probably went

897
01:01:46.08 --> 01:01:47.08
And it was dead before he just had even hit the pillow

898
01:01:48.08 --> 01:01:49.08
That's how massive a heart attack it was

899
01:01:50.08 --> 01:01:52.08
When I heard it was a heart attack, I was actually happy

900
01:01:53.08 --> 01:01:55.08
Because when I heard it, I went

901
01:01:56.08 --> 01:01:57.08
I just went shootin with him

902
01:01:58.08 --> 01:01:58.08
He was in a great mood

903
01:01:59.08 --> 01:02:00.08
Oh no no no no no no no it was a heart attack

904
01:02:01.08 --> 01:02:01.08
And I went, oh thank God

905
01:02:02.08 --> 01:02:04.08
That's the point of that

906
01:02:04.08 --> 01:02:05.08
With that subject

907
01:02:06.08 --> 01:02:06.08
So anyway

908
01:02:07.08 --> 01:02:07.08
Let's move on man

909
01:02:08.08 --> 01:02:09.08
It's talk about puppy dogs and rainbows

910
01:02:10.08 --> 01:02:10.08
Okay, we're not there yet

911
01:02:10.08 --> 01:02:11.08
No no no no no no

912
01:02:12.08 --> 01:02:14.08
I was a good reference you know miss my flight good

913
01:02:15.08 --> 01:02:17.08
I can bring my kids to school

914
01:02:17.08 --> 01:02:19.08
You know all this good they can't run

915
01:02:20.08 --> 01:02:23.08
So, I would like to go rainbows

916
01:02:23.08 --> 01:02:24.08
But we're not there yet

917
01:02:24.08 --> 01:02:25.08
All right brother, hit me

918
01:02:26.08 --> 01:02:27.08
So now you're

919
01:02:28.08 --> 01:02:30.08
You're coming back for Afghanistan

920
01:02:31.08 --> 01:02:33.08
And you know you got your girlfriend and what not

921
01:02:34.08 --> 01:02:35.08
And

922
01:02:36.08 --> 01:02:37.08
Here we go

923
01:02:37.08 --> 01:02:40.08
My first tour in Afghanistan ended a few weeks later

924
01:02:41.08 --> 01:02:42.08
And I headed back home

925
01:02:43.08 --> 01:02:45.08
I was still haunted

926
01:02:46.08 --> 01:02:48.08
By all the things I had witnessed in Kabul

927
01:02:49.08 --> 01:02:50.08
Images played over and over in my head

928
01:02:51.08 --> 01:02:52.08
Whether it was small children begging for money

929
01:02:53.08 --> 01:02:55.08
A mother holding a dead baby in the streets

930
01:02:56.08 --> 01:02:58.08
Or my buddy TJ bloodied up from a roadside bombing

931
01:02:59.08 --> 01:03:02.08
My girlfriend expected me to return as the same guy

932
01:03:03.08 --> 01:03:04.08
Who had left six months earlier

933
01:03:04.08 --> 01:03:07.08
When I was a different man now a different jodie

934
01:03:08.08 --> 01:03:11.08
Everything around me looked different too

935
01:03:12.08 --> 01:03:13.08
Maybe things hadn't changed much

936
01:03:14.08 --> 01:03:17.08
But I felt like I was on an alien planet

937
01:03:18.08 --> 01:03:20.08
My girlfriend had redecorated the house

938
01:03:21.08 --> 01:03:22.08
Moving some of the furniture around and re-paining the bedroom

939
01:03:23.08 --> 01:03:24.08
And I found it upset me

940
01:03:25.08 --> 01:03:27.08
Life had gone on without me

941
01:03:28.08 --> 01:03:29.08
And that fact was hard to take

942
01:03:30.08 --> 01:03:31.08
People around me kept saying

943
01:03:31.08 --> 01:03:33.08
What's wrong with you jodie? You've changed

944
01:03:34.08 --> 01:03:36.08
And that would make me even more upset

945
01:03:37.08 --> 01:03:39.08
Not because they were wrong

946
01:03:40.08 --> 01:03:44.08
But because I thought I was the kind of soldier who could just walk it off

947
01:03:46.08 --> 01:03:48.08
But few soldiers can

948
01:03:49.08 --> 01:03:52.08
It takes time after a tour duty for a soldier to readjust a civilian life

949
01:03:53.08 --> 01:03:54.08
And I wish I'd known that earlier

950
01:03:55.08 --> 01:03:58.08
I was expected to continue life just as I had lived

951
01:03:58.08 --> 01:04:00.08
It before my tour but I couldn't

952
01:04:01.08 --> 01:04:02.08
Not right away

953
01:04:03.08 --> 01:04:04.08
I couldn't step back into my normal routine

954
01:04:05.08 --> 01:04:07.08
As if I hadn't witnessed anything on mission

955
01:04:08.08 --> 01:04:12.08
I couldn't just hop in the car and go to the grocery shopping

956
01:04:13.08 --> 01:04:14.08
Like everything was fine

957
01:04:19.08 --> 01:04:21.08
It's interesting that you kind of felt like

958
01:04:21.08 --> 01:04:27.08
You were weak sauce because you were not the exact same before you went on to point it

959
01:04:28.08 --> 01:04:29.08
Yeah, you feel like I'm pussy

960
01:04:31.08 --> 01:04:33.08
Even though you know you shouldn't feel like a pussy

961
01:04:34.08 --> 01:04:35.08
You feel like a pussy

962
01:04:37.08 --> 01:04:39.08
It's the most frustrating

963
01:04:40.08 --> 01:04:42.08
At the time it was one of the most frustrating things

964
01:04:43.08 --> 01:04:47.08
Because you want to be that guy for your for your for your woman

965
01:04:47.08 --> 01:04:51.08
Of course, I'm still that awesome alpha male that you fell in love with

966
01:04:52.08 --> 01:04:55.08
You couldn't whatever doesn't you know doesn't blink anything

967
01:04:56.08 --> 01:04:58.08
Except that water bottle inside the road right there

968
01:04:59.08 --> 01:05:00.08
What's that pile of garbage doing right there?

969
01:05:01.08 --> 01:05:06.08
What do you mean I should just drive? Oh right. Yeah, this is our street. Sorry. It's not a road and cool

970
01:05:08.08 --> 01:05:10.08
And and

971
01:05:10.08 --> 01:05:12.08
Yeah, I just

972
01:05:14.08 --> 01:05:15.08
I

973
01:05:16.08 --> 01:05:18.08
Like I said I wish I'd had that advice that

974
01:05:19.08 --> 01:05:23.08
You know be prepared for the fact because when I went to Kosovo

975
01:05:24.08 --> 01:05:28.08
Because I've had that people ask me will you you didn't have that reaction when you came out from Kosovo

976
01:05:29.08 --> 01:05:30.08
Why lived in the barracks?

977
01:05:31.08 --> 01:05:35.08
All my shit was in storage. I didn't have a girlfriend. I had a girl that I was dating. She picked me up

978
01:05:35.08 --> 01:05:39.08
When we got home, but like it's not like we were gonna get engaged or anything

979
01:05:40.08 --> 01:05:42.08
And you know, I didn't have any real belongings

980
01:05:43.08 --> 01:05:46.08
You know, I you know, I still lived at the unit. This was a house I had bought

981
01:05:47.08 --> 01:05:51.08
You know, my girlfriend had moved in, you know, she was talking about kids and marriage

982
01:05:51.08 --> 01:05:53.08
And we had dog. We had a dog

983
01:05:54.08 --> 01:05:59.08
And I came home and I was like what happened to my house and what is going on and like

984
01:05:59.08 --> 01:06:04.08
You know, what I told my dad when I went to Kosovo

985
01:06:05.08 --> 01:06:10.08
You know, in the book I taught what my dad one of the three times I've seen him cry in my life

986
01:06:11.08 --> 01:06:15.08
Was when I deployed to Kosovo for the first time and and I said hey man, don't worry about it six months

987
01:06:16.08 --> 01:06:20.08
Hey, what's six months, right? It's like six haircuts, six six six mortgage payments

988
01:06:21.08 --> 01:06:22.08
It's nothing, don't worry about it

989
01:06:23.08 --> 01:06:25.08
And I come home and I couldn't even think that way myself

990
01:06:25.08 --> 01:06:30.08
And you know, and I know I don't know if you felt like that after your first deployment

991
01:06:31.08 --> 01:06:36.08
But this one was different because I guess I had a life to come home to beside besides the unit

992
01:06:37.08 --> 01:06:40.08
I've always been very compartmentalized in the way I think

993
01:06:41.08 --> 01:06:44.08
Right, sometimes probably to a detriment to

994
01:06:45.08 --> 01:06:47.08
My family a little bit

995
01:06:48.08 --> 01:06:52.08
But I've always been very far from the work come home. I'm not I'm not working anymore

996
01:06:52.08 --> 01:06:55.08
So just stop thinking about that stuff

997
01:06:56.08 --> 01:07:07.08
And it's it's usually pretty positive but the problem is that when you get to you realize your compartmentalizing your family out of the picture kind of which I would have a tendency to do so what

998
01:07:08.08 --> 01:07:13.08
And I mean that's probably part of one of the things that but even even when you're a real young guy

999
01:07:16.08 --> 01:07:17.08
Like how long have you been married?

1000
01:07:18.08 --> 01:07:19.08
I've been married for a long time

1001
01:07:19.08 --> 01:07:29.08
Okay, and and I've always been like that. Okay. I honestly it's wrong. I think but the seal teams was always the biggest priority in my life

1002
01:07:30.08 --> 01:07:32.08
And you know people will be like oh family first

1003
01:07:33.08 --> 01:07:40.08
That was not true for me and luckily my wife understood that and she didn't hold it against me right

1004
01:07:41.08 --> 01:07:44.08
She knew that someday she knew the seal team was wasn't gonna last forever

1005
01:07:44.08 --> 01:07:49.08
And all you guys in the military I'll tell you what the military does not last forever

1006
01:07:50.08 --> 01:07:57.08
Well the big green machine rolls on yeah, with or without you exactly and and the people that are there when you when you fall off

1007
01:07:58.08 --> 01:08:01.08
Those are ones you gotta worry about when you're still on yep

1008
01:08:01.08 --> 01:08:13.08
And so that's why I think I just was able to compartmentalize what you know away right and I would basically be almost a skits of front of this is a guy that works

1009
01:08:14.08 --> 01:08:23.08
And this is a guy that's at home. He's dad or whatever and boom. I just have that really good split and I think it was beneficial to me

1010
01:08:23.08 --> 01:08:37.08
It probably was probably is yeah, yeah, I guess I assumed I was that guy too because that's I you know I approached most things that way but

1011
01:08:38.08 --> 01:08:46.08
Maybe just having that little home of my own for that one tour and then also you know losing a couple buddies for the first time

1012
01:08:46.08 --> 01:08:55.08
Maybe I don't know I don't know what the thing like it's not like it didn't wreck anything like my career was fine like it was just well, I mean I lost a fiance out of it

1013
01:08:56.08 --> 01:09:04.08
But yeah, yeah, and that's what happens next so she announced this is back to the book here she announced that she was leaving

1014
01:09:05.08 --> 01:09:09.08
I was shocked because I didn't want to break things off. I just wanted to postpone the wedding

1015
01:09:10.08 --> 01:09:12.08
But for her this was all too much

1016
01:09:12.08 --> 01:09:19.08
Our relationship was over while I was certain this was the right time to get well, I wasn't certain this was the right time to get married

1017
01:09:20.08 --> 01:09:22.08
I was certain about one thing

1018
01:09:23.08 --> 01:09:28.08
I wanted to go back to Afghanistan in this time as a sniper

1019
01:09:29.08 --> 01:09:31.08
And that's something that

1020
01:09:33.08 --> 01:09:39.08
Yeah, I mean that's something that's hard to reconcile the feeling of

1021
01:09:39.08 --> 01:09:45.08
Just want to go back. I mean that's I want to go back right now. Yeah, of course

1022
01:09:46.08 --> 01:09:51.08
People, hey, yeah, what's it like you you asked me what's it like to be in politics? I go I'd rather be killing ISIS

1023
01:09:52.08 --> 01:09:57.08
Yeah, frankly, and I you know, I'm not ashamed to say it. I was good at it and and I love

1024
01:09:58.08 --> 01:10:04.08
The people that are out there doing it for us, you know, even though I'm not one of them anymore. You know what and

1025
01:10:04.08 --> 01:10:12.08
What we kind of skipped over but 9 11 happened during my sniper course and sniper course is we don't just have a rotation

1026
01:10:13.08 --> 01:10:16.08
I'm going on in Canada. We're very small military if you're on a sniper course

1027
01:10:17.08 --> 01:10:22.08
Holy shit like you've got you got there. They run like a one or two years something maybe

1028
01:10:23.08 --> 01:10:27.08
There's not even every year. No, well, they're now I think it is but back then

1029
01:10:27.08 --> 01:10:33.08
Mine was the first one in three years that had happened 25 of us tried out three of us passed

1030
01:10:34.08 --> 01:10:37.08
So it's not like you get on it and it's okay. You just got a pass

1031
01:10:38.08 --> 01:10:43.08
So but 9 11 happened on like day five or six or something and you know

1032
01:10:44.08 --> 01:10:48.08
As the towers fell we watched it fall on TV like they interrupted a class

1033
01:10:50.08 --> 01:10:54.08
We thought it was like a sesna right the guy comes so much as a little plane of the world trades in it

1034
01:10:54.08 --> 01:10:56.08
We're in the middle of a you don't interrupt a class

1035
01:10:56.08 --> 01:10:59.08
You know right you don't interrupt a training session

1036
01:11:00.08 --> 01:11:03.08
We're like okay man, thanks and the duty sergeant runs off

1037
01:11:04.08 --> 01:11:10.08
But we think a drunk guy in a sesna and then he comes back and then so we go down to watch at the duty station and

1038
01:11:11.08 --> 01:11:14.84
As it as the towers are falling. I'm hearing like the starting bell

1039
01:11:14.84 --> 01:11:22.84
Right, I'm hearing like the horn at the start of the super bull and I'm like oh, it's on because I was considering retiring because of the lack of action

1040
01:11:26.84 --> 01:11:28.84
So you did get your

1041
01:11:30.84 --> 01:11:37.84
I hate to call it a dream but you got your dream like I'm back to Afghanistan. Oh, yeah, and this time you're going as a sniper

1042
01:11:37.84 --> 01:11:45.84
Which is awesome you're back in Afghanistan and there's some heavy fighting going on now. There's some legit fighting and and

1043
01:11:47.84 --> 01:11:53.84
The Canadians are actually leading operations which is the first time in quite some time. I think since Korea

1044
01:11:54.84 --> 01:11:59.84
Yeah, well this this what what we what we were we this was the first time we'd let operations

1045
01:12:00.84 --> 01:12:02.84
That were non peacekeeping

1046
01:12:03.84 --> 01:12:04.84
Ever

1047
01:12:04.84 --> 01:12:10.84
Since Korea yeah, you're right and this but we what we walked into was the first offensive and NATO's history

1048
01:12:12.84 --> 01:12:13.84
Ever

1049
01:12:13.84 --> 01:12:20.84
Think about it right NATO has never been on the offensive except for enough Afghanistan kind of weird but North Atlantic treaty organization

1050
01:12:21.84 --> 01:12:23.84
But anyway, this one was called operation Medusa

1051
01:12:25.84 --> 01:12:30.84
This Canadian led up NATO operation was going to be different from anything we'd done so far

1052
01:12:30.84 --> 01:12:38.84
It was a bit of a wake-up call so was the fact that my buddy Jeff Walsh had been killed in friendly fire in an accident that happened in August

1053
01:12:39.84 --> 01:12:43.84
Clearly we were entering a high risk situation

1054
01:12:43.84 --> 01:12:52.84
That didn't determine any way in any way if anything it made my resolve stronger. I trained for this and I was ready

1055
01:12:53.84 --> 01:12:55.84
It's a good feeling

1056
01:12:55.84 --> 01:13:00.84
What what was the friendly fire was an aircraft or was it shooting?

1057
01:13:00.84 --> 01:13:05.84
No this one was unfortunately it was his buddy in the vehicle. They were sitting next to each other and

1058
01:13:09.84 --> 01:13:11.84
I guess

1059
01:13:11.84 --> 01:13:13.84
He got in with his rifle

1060
01:13:13.84 --> 01:13:15.84
Not paying attention to the muzzle

1061
01:13:16.84 --> 01:13:20.84
And it went off and shot Jeff through the face and killed him

1062
01:13:20.84 --> 01:13:28.84
That no one really knows exactly what happened but that's basically pretty much what everyone figures happened

1063
01:13:31.84 --> 01:13:33.84
Muzzle discipline

1064
01:13:33.84 --> 01:13:37.84
Never point your weapon it's something you do not want to destroy

1065
01:13:37.84 --> 01:13:41.84
Yeah, keep your finger off the trigger, keep your weapon on safe

1066
01:13:44.84 --> 01:13:48.84
All right, now as you guys are getting ready to go into this operation Medusa

1067
01:13:48.84 --> 01:13:54.84
One of the orders that comes out is if anybody gets hurt during this mission

1068
01:13:54.84 --> 01:13:56.84
We're going to stop right away and take care of it

1069
01:13:57.84 --> 01:14:02.84
And you're going to make sure the casualties are dealt with and then reassess the situation before moving forward

1070
01:14:04.84 --> 01:14:05.84
That was during the

1071
01:14:06.84 --> 01:14:09.84
The company commanders orders right and you were kind of thinking

1072
01:14:09.84 --> 01:14:12.84
Wait a second. Yeah, for those of you that don't know

1073
01:14:12.84 --> 01:14:24.84
Which is I'm sure people that aren't the military when you're going on in attack you're your ideas to maintain the momentum of the attack and you take casualties along the way while you're attacking

1074
01:14:25.84 --> 01:14:26.84
You keep attacking

1075
01:14:26.84 --> 01:14:31.84
Yeah, you don't stop you know you're going to take casualties. You're going to keep people going to get hit things are going to slow you down

1076
01:14:31.84 --> 01:14:35.84
You don't slow down. You try and keep pushing forward. Keep pushing forward

1077
01:14:35.84 --> 01:14:41.84
I've said it on this podcast before aggression will mitigate risk

1078
01:14:42.84 --> 01:14:47.84
So you get aggressive you move through the target you get the target secure and then you can deal with the guys that are down

1079
01:14:47.84 --> 01:14:49.84
Yeah, not that you're going to

1080
01:14:49.84 --> 01:14:53.84
Ignore them and you can't drop off a medic here and there to handle a situation

1081
01:14:53.84 --> 01:14:56.84
But you're not going to stop. I mean literally you know stop

1082
01:14:56.84 --> 01:15:00.84
No, you can't stop the whole battle group you can't stop

1083
01:15:00.84 --> 01:15:06.84
But you know though I don't know if the order was delivered the way it was intended

1084
01:15:06.84 --> 01:15:10.84
But that's how it that's basically what that's to paraphrase what was said

1085
01:15:10.84 --> 01:15:15.84
Yeah, and that's why you know a couple of us were just kind of like yeah, and what's really what's really

1086
01:15:15.84 --> 01:15:23.84
To your point of you're not sure if that's what was meant what's really important is that the main thing you want to get across to your troops

1087
01:15:23.84 --> 01:15:27.84
When you're going on to assault is you want the main point to be get aggressive

1088
01:15:27.84 --> 01:15:33.84
That's the main point that you want to get across to them not hey the main point that you're going to take away from this is if we take casually stop

1089
01:15:33.84 --> 01:15:35.84
You know

1090
01:15:35.84 --> 01:15:42.84
We're going to get aggressive. We're going to finish through the target. We're going to secure the target and nothing is going to stop us from doing that

1091
01:15:42.84 --> 01:15:48.84
I don't care what happens. That's what you want to have going into it. Right. That's that's my that was always my impression

1092
01:15:48.84 --> 01:15:56.84
I've never been a company commander though, but you've received plenty of orders. Yes, sir. All right

1093
01:15:57.84 --> 01:15:59.84
Now

1094
01:15:59.84 --> 01:16:03.84
We're starting it on the assault the assault is going down

1095
01:16:03.84 --> 01:16:08.84
And here we go up ahead the first vehicles were closing in on the white schoolhouse

1096
01:16:08.84 --> 01:16:16.84
The Zettelmired cleared away for the lead between comprising of four lat LAVs and a G wagon to take position next to the schoolhouse

1097
01:16:16.84 --> 01:16:22.84
It was at this point that the Taliban decided to make their presence known by firing an anti tank

1098
01:16:22.84 --> 01:16:26.84
Recorulus rifle round at the softest vehicle of this lead platoon the G wagon

1099
01:16:26.84 --> 01:16:31.84
The round went right through the front windshield causing immediate casualties

1100
01:16:31.84 --> 01:16:36.84
Next our whole soul opened up all at once every can and every coaxial machine gun was firing

1101
01:16:36.84 --> 01:16:40.84
Taliban were coming out of the weeds all around us out of tunnels windows mouse holes

1102
01:16:40.84 --> 01:16:45.84
They had their head and they had to held their powder to the last second

1103
01:16:45.84 --> 01:16:50.84
And then it was game on they had the defenders advantage and they used it

1104
01:16:50.84 --> 01:16:55.84
The call went out on the radio that one of our vehicles was hit and we had casualties

1105
01:16:55.84 --> 01:17:04.84
As this was happening one of the LAVs that was stuck next to the schoolhouse went nose first into a ditch and was stuck

1106
01:17:04.84 --> 01:17:10.84
I was trying to listen on the radio when suddenly the troops who were sticking out of the top hatches of our LAV yelled

1107
01:17:10.84 --> 01:17:16.84
Holy fuck they're right there. They let go of burst from their C7s followed by grenade from a rifle mounted grenade launcher

1108
01:17:16.84 --> 01:17:22.84
At that moment our artillery began raining down and air support started dropping bombs on the Taliban

1109
01:17:22.84 --> 01:17:32.84
I felt helpless during all this chaos because the plan for us as snipers was to get involved only one subjective rugby had been achieved

1110
01:17:32.84 --> 01:17:37.84
At that point we would get up on the schools roof and provide cover for the bound to the next objective

1111
01:17:37.84 --> 01:17:46.84
But in this situation Barry cash those are your sniper teammates Barry cash and I were stuck inside the LAV right at the time

1112
01:17:46.84 --> 01:17:50.84
When our shooting skills were needed up top needed most up top

1113
01:17:50.84 --> 01:17:56.84
I was working the radio doing my best to keep everyone in the vehicle informed of what was happening up ahead

1114
01:17:56.84 --> 01:18:01.84
Okay, we've got three wounded in action and one killed in action

1115
01:18:01.84 --> 01:18:07.84
I said relaying the message that there were three wounded soldiers and one who was killed in the G-wagon that had been hit

1116
01:18:07.84 --> 01:18:14.84
Every soldier had a zap number which would be used as an identifier in case you were wounded or killed in the field

1117
01:18:14.84 --> 01:18:21.84
Standard operating procedure was that if someone died in combat you never revealed their name during the battle

1118
01:18:21.84 --> 01:18:26.84
At this point we didn't know which soldier had been killed in that attack on the G-wagon

1119
01:18:26.84 --> 01:18:29.84
And no one seemed to know the zap number either

1120
01:18:29.84 --> 01:18:36.84
Finally the major got on the radio I need to know now who the fuck just got killed

1121
01:18:36.84 --> 01:18:40.84
The radio crackled and a voice came on

1122
01:18:40.84 --> 01:18:49.84
It was worn off Sir Rick Nolan sir Rick Nolan was the soldier I had had a brief argument with the day before

1123
01:18:49.84 --> 01:18:53.84
I've always felt bad that our last conversation was a little strained

1124
01:18:53.84 --> 01:18:59.84
Rick was a good man and a great soldier sitting in the front seat of that G-wagon

1125
01:18:59.84 --> 01:19:02.84
He had no chance of surviving a direct rocket hit

1126
01:19:02.84 --> 01:19:07.84
I looked at Barry and Cash we were all stunned in the silence

1127
01:19:07.84 --> 01:19:12.84
No matter how much you prepare for that moment when a soldier you know becomes a casualty

1128
01:19:12.84 --> 01:19:15.84
There's nothing that compares to the actual feeling

1129
01:19:15.84 --> 01:19:22.84
On top of that it was jarring for all of us because we just didn't expect a soldier with his level of experience

1130
01:19:22.84 --> 01:19:25.84
And status to be the first one taking out on the mission

1131
01:19:34.84 --> 01:19:37.84
That section right there

1132
01:19:39.84 --> 01:19:42.84
Reminding me we were I had guys out

1133
01:19:42.84 --> 01:19:47.84
They were clearing the sector of Ramadi

1134
01:19:47.84 --> 01:19:53.84
And big gunfight broke out and I don't know three or four hundred meters away

1135
01:19:53.84 --> 01:19:57.84
Maybe five hundred meters away whatever it was

1136
01:19:57.84 --> 01:20:00.84
I can just hear gunfire mayhem

1137
01:20:00.84 --> 01:20:05.84
Radeos I got up to a rooftop and I'm

1138
01:20:06.84 --> 01:20:11.84
You know hey what's up and I hear the the element commander got on the radio

1139
01:20:11.84 --> 01:20:16.84
And he says hey we're in a cash lead evacuation we got one killed and one wounded

1140
01:20:16.84 --> 01:20:18.84
And

1141
01:20:20.84 --> 01:20:26.84
They were with I don't know probably twenty Iraqi soldiers and five or six seals

1142
01:20:28.84 --> 01:20:31.84
But you don't know who it is right and some waiting

1143
01:20:31.84 --> 01:20:36.84
And you don't want to say anything on the radio and I'm waiting and I and

1144
01:20:36.84 --> 01:20:44.84
Finally I just said is it I rack your American is like the longest

1145
01:20:44.84 --> 01:20:51.84
Pause I've ever heard of my life and he comes back and he says both Iraqi and he was like they know

1146
01:20:51.84 --> 01:20:56.84
Faced the Iraqi but to the Iraqi soldiers but you know I was

1147
01:20:56.84 --> 01:21:01.84
Relieved very relieved at that point and you talk about that too and hear how

1148
01:21:01.84 --> 01:21:07.84
Somebody gets hurt or somebody gets wounded or somebody gets killed and you you know it's one of your guys

1149
01:21:07.84 --> 01:21:14.84
And you feel guilty when you hear the name and it's not whatever one of your what are your better friends or whatever

1150
01:21:14.84 --> 01:21:19.84
And that's one of those strange and freaking horrible things about war yeah

1151
01:21:23.84 --> 01:21:25.84
You guys were I

1152
01:21:26.84 --> 01:21:30.84
Mean this was like a shit sandwich out of the gate yeah

1153
01:21:30.84 --> 01:21:39.84
Yeah, it you got to remember this is the first time Canada's been on the offensive since Korea and

1154
01:21:39.84 --> 01:21:41.84
Doesn't matter how much you train

1155
01:21:42.84 --> 01:21:48.84
The first few minutes are going to be sloppy until you get your shit together

1156
01:21:48.84 --> 01:21:56.84
Well, I shouldn't have even said shit same which I should have said this is combat that's it because I mean it's going

1157
01:21:56.84 --> 01:22:01.84
It's going to you going to there you're setting up your positions you're moving into position

1158
01:22:01.84 --> 01:22:06.84
The enemy hadn't really revealed himself as you said in the book they held their powder

1159
01:22:06.84 --> 01:22:10.84
Yeah, well, we we wondered if they were there at all because the day before

1160
01:22:11.84 --> 01:22:15.84
We watched as they all drove out of the area fighting aged guys

1161
01:22:16.84 --> 01:22:22.84
Just drove away in trucks trucks full they left some guys behind they actually

1162
01:22:22.84 --> 01:22:33.84
You know the average Taliban guy, you know, you don't even have the duck if you shoot now. You're really I mean you should duck but the point is he's probably not going to hit you, but they whoever they left behind

1163
01:22:34.84 --> 01:22:39.84
Were guys that knew what the wood knew what they were out knew what they were doing and I give them credit for that like

1164
01:22:40.84 --> 01:22:45.84
You know they're not soldiers as we consider it, but they're tough guys

1165
01:22:45.84 --> 01:22:56.84
You know and you guys you sniper team you guys didn't even have your body armor. Yeah, well, because it's because it's part of the you know

1166
01:22:56.84 --> 01:23:03.84
What's the three rules of special ops, right? Always look cool always know who you are and if you don't know where you are make sure you look cool

1167
01:23:03.84 --> 01:23:11.84
Right, so wearing ball caps and not having body armor makes you look cool, but also in our minds and we trained

1168
01:23:11.84 --> 01:23:21.84
We have enough shit to dump you know why add body armor to it and and helmets, you know, we're going to be in a position. We shouldn't if we're being engaged we fucked up

1169
01:23:22.84 --> 01:23:30.84
But I tell you we I don't know if you're going to read it, but there's a there's a few moment few minutes later, I'm like I really wish I had some body armor

1170
01:23:30.84 --> 01:23:35.84
Oh no, I'm not going to read it, but I asked why I brought it up and I was actually I was actually not going to bring it up

1171
01:23:35.84 --> 01:23:47.84
But then I circled to bring it up, you know why because there's somebody out there that's in the field right now that's going on some operation and they're thinking you know what I probably better off if I didn't bring my body armor and I'm going to tell you

1172
01:23:47.84 --> 01:23:56.84
Bring your body armor, yeah, bring your body armor. I did want the operation that for a bunch of reasons

1173
01:23:56.84 --> 01:24:11.84
I decided that I didn't need body armor, right, and of course ended up in a bad scenario and the only thing I'm thinking as I have as I'm have a gun pointed out my chest is

1174
01:24:11.84 --> 01:24:22.84
You're an idiot. Yeah, and you don't have body armor on. We had we had the strike plate. Oh, front of our chest rig, but we found out after

1175
01:24:22.84 --> 01:24:32.84
If we'd ever been struck in that plate, the spall from the plate would have killed us because it's designed to be inside the body armor, the the Kevler

1176
01:24:32.84 --> 01:24:38.84
Because it had a Kevler wrap around it around the around the ceramic turns out it's not

1177
01:24:38.84 --> 01:24:50.84
That wrap is there more just for aesthetics or something. I don't know but anyway, so it's like oh, no, no, it has to be inside the issued vest in order for it to work a pocket in your chest rig

1178
01:24:50.84 --> 01:24:57.84
Yeah, no, that's not the other crazy thing again for guys that are overseas right now even if you think you're going to be far enough away from a

1179
01:24:57.84 --> 01:25:08.84
Firefight if you could hit with an ID you want your body armor on 100% 100% I always wear my body armor in a vehicle. Yeah after this but

1180
01:25:08.84 --> 01:25:16.84
But even the night I was hit I didn't have body armor on yeah, I don't always just a weird thing for me, but

1181
01:25:16.84 --> 01:25:25.84
You know, they're the Romans and Irna the Greeks the Romans they called it, you know, the first time you see combat, you know, see in the elephant

1182
01:25:25.84 --> 01:25:36.84
So you know, we, so let's go back to Rick so Rick is a war officer, so do you guys maybe a pedi officer chief pedi officer

1183
01:25:36.84 --> 01:25:44.84
Roughly he's like a company he was a company quartermaster, so he's not sergeant major, but he's like the next NCO down

1184
01:25:44.84 --> 01:25:56.84
I'm going to guess he had about 18 20 years he would he had been a recon guy most of it, you know, I trained under him mentor to under him you know, it's like

1185
01:25:56.84 --> 01:26:03.84
When you when you imagine casualties you're imagining private Smith and Corporal Jones and you know whoever

1186
01:26:03.84 --> 01:26:10.84
But our first guy killed is a guy who trained his whole life for war, and he's the first guy gone

1187
01:26:10.84 --> 01:26:22.84
You know, like there's no there's no status there's no seniority in combat. No it doesn't care if you've trained every day for 100 years or if you've trained one day forever

1188
01:26:22.84 --> 01:26:26.84
That bullet is if it's got your name on it's got your name on it

1189
01:26:26.84 --> 01:26:37.84
I was going to say bullets don't even have names on them. Yeah, they're going to hit yeah, and that's why combat is so that's one of the things about combat that makes it so

1190
01:26:37.84 --> 01:26:44.34
So damn awful is like you said you can train as hard as you can train you can make no mistakes

1191
01:26:44.34 --> 01:26:53.34
You can be the perfect warrior on the perfect mission and you can still get blown up. You can still get shot. There's nothing you can do about it

1192
01:26:53.34 --> 01:27:01.84
Yeah, I mean I hate to say there's nothing you can do about it. You're getting in you're going to be trading lead with other people and

1193
01:27:01.84 --> 01:27:11.84
That bullet can hit you and even if there are if they are dirt farmers with with 30 year old AKs if it's functioning. It's a threat and you know

1194
01:27:11.84 --> 01:27:17.84
I've had chats with guys about why was why was that vehicle even on the objective?

1195
01:27:17.84 --> 01:27:26.64
When you had these perfectly good armored vehicles now these are up armored jeeps the these these the gee it's there. They're the German one right

1196
01:27:26.64 --> 01:27:35.64
We'd only train to this point right and and in training that vehicle went to the objective

1197
01:27:35.64 --> 01:27:42.64
So why wouldn't it? You know until until someone puts a recoil is rifle round through it and you go

1198
01:27:42.64 --> 01:27:50.64
Might be best to leave that one behind and maybe just get another lab for the for the company quartermaster which after that they did

1199
01:27:50.64 --> 01:27:52.64
But you know some lessons have to be learned

1200
01:27:52.64 --> 01:27:57.64
But so the mayhem continues

1201
01:27:57.64 --> 01:28:00.64
You end up helping

1202
01:28:00.64 --> 01:28:02.64
Collect the casualties yeah

1203
01:28:02.64 --> 01:28:08.64
And now you're sitting there you're at them when we would call a casually collection point. Do you use that term?

1204
01:28:08.64 --> 01:28:16.64
Yeah, I don't know if you use that in here. CCP. So you're at the CCP the casualty collection point and here you go

1205
01:28:16.64 --> 01:28:24.64
One of the most important things in the field of battle is taking care of your dead in fact the creative of the royals is never leave a royal behind

1206
01:28:24.64 --> 01:28:34.64
On the field you want to get the bodies out of sight as quickly as possible. It's demoralizing for a soldier to witness a dead comrade during battle, especially when it's someone of Rick stature

1207
01:28:34.64 --> 01:28:42.64
I went in the back of an LAV grabbed a couple of body bags and got to work with some of our other guys

1208
01:28:42.64 --> 01:28:46.64
We picked up Rick and zipped him into a bag

1209
01:28:46.64 --> 01:28:50.64
One of the other fallen officers was Frank Mellish

1210
01:28:50.64 --> 01:28:56.64
For a second I had a bit of hope because he was on a stretcher which meant he might have only been wounded

1211
01:28:56.64 --> 01:29:00.64
But once I saw soldiers approach and check his dog tags

1212
01:29:00.64 --> 01:29:05.64
I knew he was gone a casualty of the round that took out the zettle mire

1213
01:29:05.64 --> 01:29:13.64
The sad twist was that Frank Mellish and Rick know it had been friends for their whole careers and now they were lying on the ground together

1214
01:29:13.64 --> 01:29:19.64
Next I help put private William Cushley into a bag

1215
01:29:19.64 --> 01:29:25.64
I'll never forget looking directly into his still open eyes and saying sorry bro

1216
01:29:25.64 --> 01:29:37.64
As I zipped up his body bag

1217
01:29:37.64 --> 01:29:41.64
Now that's obviously enough to crush

1218
01:29:41.64 --> 01:29:47.64
Some people mentally and emotionally at that point

1219
01:29:47.64 --> 01:29:57.64
But soldiers don't have time

1220
01:29:57.64 --> 01:30:01.64
They have to do their jobs

1221
01:30:01.64 --> 01:30:03.64
What?

1222
01:30:03.64 --> 01:30:07.64
As you went through that emotion

1223
01:30:07.64 --> 01:30:11.64
And then you turn around and you go, okay?

1224
01:30:11.64 --> 01:30:12.64
What's next?

1225
01:30:12.64 --> 01:30:13.64
Yep

1226
01:30:13.64 --> 01:30:15.64
How's that work?

1227
01:30:15.64 --> 01:30:19.64
That's what you do

1228
01:30:19.64 --> 01:30:25.64
If I had spent more than that when second say in sorry bro, what am I missing?

1229
01:30:25.64 --> 01:30:31.64
I was doing, I couldn't get my snipers into a position to be useful

1230
01:30:31.64 --> 01:30:35.64
Being snipers so we were being useful in other ways

1231
01:30:35.64 --> 01:30:43.64
And once that problem was dealt with because you could see the guy, like you know we were trying to reorganize ourselves here

1232
01:30:43.64 --> 01:30:45.64
And the re-org phase

1233
01:30:45.64 --> 01:30:50.64
The guys are going the long way around of the vehicle because they were lined up next to the vehicle

1234
01:30:50.64 --> 01:30:53.64
And so me and a couple of guys are like, okay, we got to fix this

1235
01:30:53.64 --> 01:30:59.64
We fixed it and people you felt, you felt people relaxed

1236
01:30:59.64 --> 01:31:05.64
And then my main concern was that's still our objective

1237
01:31:05.64 --> 01:31:08.64
And we got to get to it so what's next?

1238
01:31:08.64 --> 01:31:12.64
And that's when I went looking for like I'm not even sure who's in charge at this point

1239
01:31:12.64 --> 01:31:14.64
Because we had taken so much of our leadership

1240
01:31:14.64 --> 01:31:18.64
It'd been hurt the company's sergeant major to the warrants

1241
01:31:18.64 --> 01:31:25.64
You know, when that Zettelmeyer got hit, you know, it wounded a bunch of guys

1242
01:31:25.64 --> 01:31:30.64
And you know we had Afghans with us, we had some Americans with us

1243
01:31:30.64 --> 01:31:33.64
What do you call the National Guard?

1244
01:31:33.64 --> 01:31:37.64
I think the National Guard mentors for the Afghans are with us

1245
01:31:37.64 --> 01:31:43.64
And my biggest disappointment from that day

1246
01:31:43.64 --> 01:31:48.64
And I know I'm going to catch some, I might catch some shit from some guys that were there

1247
01:31:48.64 --> 01:31:51.64
We didn't take our objective

1248
01:31:51.64 --> 01:31:53.64
To this day

1249
01:31:53.64 --> 01:31:59.64
You know what, 2016, you know, it's just 10 years later

1250
01:31:59.64 --> 01:32:02.64
Almost, it's a 10 or a little bit 10 years

1251
01:32:02.64 --> 01:32:06.64
And to this day, I'm like, we didn't take our objective

1252
01:32:06.64 --> 01:32:10.64
Yeah

1253
01:32:10.64 --> 01:32:17.64
In part of that, you know, and for one thing, when I, when I, you know, was reading that

1254
01:32:17.64 --> 01:32:22.64
And I mean obviously it's just emotional moment

1255
01:32:22.64 --> 01:32:24.64
And I knew that you just had to detach from the emotion

1256
01:32:24.64 --> 01:32:26.64
And I used that term all the time

1257
01:32:26.64 --> 01:32:28.64
Yeah, you got to just detach from it

1258
01:32:28.64 --> 01:32:30.64
And you got to be conscious of that

1259
01:32:30.64 --> 01:32:32.64
So like, folks that are listening

1260
01:32:32.64 --> 01:32:34.64
That are thinking how do you do that? That's how you do it

1261
01:32:34.64 --> 01:32:38.64
But you cannot, you've got, when you feel the emotion starting to override

1262
01:32:38.64 --> 01:32:42.64
Your logic and your ability to do your duty

1263
01:32:42.64 --> 01:32:44.64
That's what you have to do, you have to go, okay

1264
01:32:44.64 --> 01:32:48.64
I got to detach from those emotions and I got to do my job now

1265
01:32:48.64 --> 01:32:49.64
Yeah

1266
01:32:49.64 --> 01:32:52.64
In that moment, like, I actually don't remember

1267
01:32:52.64 --> 01:32:55.64
Like I didn't really have any feelings

1268
01:32:55.64 --> 01:32:58.64
You know, I get more feeling now out of it

1269
01:32:58.64 --> 01:32:59.64
Listening to you read it

1270
01:32:59.64 --> 01:33:00.64
Yeah

1271
01:33:00.64 --> 01:33:01.64
Because that

1272
01:33:01.64 --> 01:33:06.64
Starting with, especially when TJ got, got hurt, you know

1273
01:33:06.64 --> 01:33:08.64
That's our workspace

1274
01:33:08.64 --> 01:33:09.64
Yeah

1275
01:33:09.64 --> 01:33:11.64
Like, you know, here we're in an office

1276
01:33:11.64 --> 01:33:15.64
Yeah, you can, people typing, doors opening, closing

1277
01:33:15.64 --> 01:33:19.64
That's the normal sound and vibe of this workspace

1278
01:33:19.64 --> 01:33:27.64
We had burning vehicles, we had dead soldiers, we had wounded soldiers, we had about 15 wounded by this point

1279
01:33:27.64 --> 01:33:34.64
We had air support raining in, we had artillery support raining in, we had enemy mortars coming down

1280
01:33:34.64 --> 01:33:37.64
And you know, that's the norm

1281
01:33:37.64 --> 01:33:43.64
They don't like, when you sign up to be a Navy seal, they don't hide the fact that you might get gunfights

1282
01:33:43.64 --> 01:33:46.64
It's like the first thing you read, it's in big, bold black letters

1283
01:33:46.64 --> 01:33:48.64
You're gonna, you could get killed

1284
01:33:48.64 --> 01:33:54.64
It's not in the small print at the bottom of the contract, you know, claws, B of Section 4

1285
01:33:54.64 --> 01:33:55.64
It's right there

1286
01:33:55.64 --> 01:33:57.64
That's what you signed up for

1287
01:33:57.64 --> 01:33:59.64
So

1288
01:33:59.64 --> 01:34:03.64
It's not abnormal for these things to be happening

1289
01:34:03.64 --> 01:34:09.64
What you have to do is accept that they happened and carry on with the job

1290
01:34:09.64 --> 01:34:18.64
And in that moment, I remember, I said, sorry bro, because I was, I was, I was actually probably felt more like, hey man, sorry you're out of the game

1291
01:34:18.64 --> 01:34:21.64
Because it's gonna get exciting from here

1292
01:34:21.64 --> 01:34:30.64
You know, I, oh, a fallen soldier in combat to me is, especially a volunteer

1293
01:34:30.64 --> 01:34:33.64
We weren't drafted, did anyone make you join the Navy?

1294
01:34:33.64 --> 01:34:34.64
No

1295
01:34:34.64 --> 01:34:38.64
I, I fought with my parents to get into the Army

1296
01:34:38.64 --> 01:34:46.64
I, I would have, I would have, fist, I would have fought ten of my best friends to get that job as that sniper team leader

1297
01:34:46.64 --> 01:34:54.64
And there is nowhere else I wanted to be and if soldier falling in combat doing the job he chose and a, and a play

1298
01:34:54.64 --> 01:34:56.64
It's not of our choosing

1299
01:34:56.64 --> 01:35:01.64
Don't ever feel sorry for me, because I went to Afghanistan, believe me, I wanted to be there

1300
01:35:01.64 --> 01:35:04.64
And for, and to fall

1301
01:35:04.64 --> 01:35:11.64
I get in a lot of shit by some people, but that's, it's one of the greatest things a soldier can do

1302
01:35:11.64 --> 01:35:18.64
Is the fall for it with his friends doing the job that he chose or she chose

1303
01:35:18.64 --> 01:35:25.64
And it's, I, I get in shit sometime because I think like this

1304
01:35:25.64 --> 01:35:30.64
Well, it's, I think the reason that is is because it's so hard for people that

1305
01:35:30.64 --> 01:35:34.64
Don't know what that brotherhood is like

1306
01:35:34.64 --> 01:35:37.64
They don't know what it's like to want to do that

1307
01:35:37.64 --> 01:35:42.64
They don't understand that that's

1308
01:35:42.64 --> 01:35:46.64
That's the soldier in the child, that's the way you've wanted to be your whole life

1309
01:35:46.64 --> 01:35:50.64
That's the way I want to be my whole life so to, for these things to happen is

1310
01:35:50.64 --> 01:35:57.64
It's like feeling bad for an MMA fighter because they got punched in the face

1311
01:35:57.64 --> 01:35:59.64
There you go for it

1312
01:35:59.64 --> 01:36:02.64
You signed up for it and those guys, you know, they're there to fight

1313
01:36:02.64 --> 01:36:08.64
And the military, you're there to fight and a byproduct of fighting in this situation

1314
01:36:08.64 --> 01:36:11.64
Can be injury, it can be death

1315
01:36:11.64 --> 01:36:15.64
And like you said, it's what we all signed up for

1316
01:36:15.64 --> 01:36:20.64
And you know, going back to the situation here

1317
01:36:20.64 --> 01:36:26.64
One of the things that you talked about the fact that you guys didn't secure your objective

1318
01:36:26.64 --> 01:36:30.64
And one of the reasons that you didn't secure your objective the next day

1319
01:36:30.64 --> 01:36:33.64
is because you had another friendly fire incident

1320
01:36:33.64 --> 01:36:37.64
And this is awful and you know, the book that I wrote with

1321
01:36:37.64 --> 01:36:42.64
Dave starts off with a friendly fire scenario happening

1322
01:36:42.64 --> 01:36:45.64
And I wish I could explain to civilians

1323
01:36:45.64 --> 01:36:48.64
It's really hard for people to understand how these things happened

1324
01:36:48.64 --> 01:36:50.64
I mean we've already talked about it

1325
01:36:50.64 --> 01:36:53.64
What two times in this book here's another one

1326
01:36:53.64 --> 01:36:55.64
ATEN's come in

1327
01:36:55.64 --> 01:37:00.64
You're basically like half awake trying to get trying to get a little bit of sleep

1328
01:37:00.64 --> 01:37:01.64
Yeah

1329
01:37:01.64 --> 01:37:04.64
And all of a sudden you know you hear the gun fire, you hear things happening

1330
01:37:04.64 --> 01:37:07.64
All of a sudden you hear an ATEN burst go

1331
01:37:07.64 --> 01:37:12.64
And cash, you're your teammate cash

1332
01:37:12.64 --> 01:37:14.64
He's like, you're not going to believe this

1333
01:37:14.64 --> 01:37:17.64
But I think he just strafed our own guys

1334
01:37:17.64 --> 01:37:20.64
Strafed is when you fire machine gun can

1335
01:37:20.64 --> 01:37:23.64
And fire fire from an aircraft

1336
01:37:23.64 --> 01:37:30.64
And sure enough 30 soldiers more than 30 soldiers were injured

1337
01:37:30.64 --> 01:37:31.64
Yeah

1338
01:37:31.64 --> 01:37:35.64
And one was killed and by the way the one that was killed was private mark

1339
01:37:35.64 --> 01:37:40.64
Graham who was a Olympic spreader for Canada 1992 and Barcelona

1340
01:37:40.64 --> 01:37:41.64
Yeah

1341
01:37:45.64 --> 01:37:47.64
I mean it's a nightmare

1342
01:37:47.64 --> 01:37:49.64
It was a nightmare

1343
01:37:49.64 --> 01:37:51.64
It was

1344
01:37:51.64 --> 01:37:54.64
Such a I even got mad at cash at first

1345
01:37:54.64 --> 01:37:58.64
Because I was like because I heard it and you know that breath

1346
01:37:58.64 --> 01:38:01.64
It's actually a nice feeling

1347
01:38:01.64 --> 01:38:03.64
And till that happens

1348
01:38:03.64 --> 01:38:05.64
And that one sounded weird

1349
01:38:05.64 --> 01:38:07.64
Because I got his half awake

1350
01:38:07.64 --> 01:38:10.64
And they were doing strafing runs across

1351
01:38:10.64 --> 01:38:13.64
Because we were on each side of the Argonne Dobrever

1352
01:38:13.64 --> 01:38:16.64
So there's a bit of distance

1353
01:38:16.64 --> 01:38:19.64
And that one was like that was real close

1354
01:38:19.64 --> 01:38:22.64
That's kind of weird and I'm trying to just wake up

1355
01:38:22.64 --> 01:38:25.64
And cash is yeah they hit the hit us

1356
01:38:25.64 --> 01:38:27.64
I go what the what are you talking about

1357
01:38:27.64 --> 01:38:30.64
Why would he and I look down from our sniper position

1358
01:38:30.64 --> 01:38:35.64
To where the vehicles were and that's what exactly what it happened

1359
01:38:35.64 --> 01:38:38.64
And on my mind I know what an A10 strike does

1360
01:38:38.64 --> 01:38:41.64
I'm like oh my god he killed all my friends

1361
01:38:41.64 --> 01:38:46.64
And then through the dust and so right away

1362
01:38:46.64 --> 01:38:48.64
I'm like okay well if I'm the enemy I know what I would do

1363
01:38:48.64 --> 01:38:52.64
You know sound the bugles boys were attacking

1364
01:38:52.64 --> 01:38:55.64
They didn't do that

1365
01:38:55.64 --> 01:39:00.64
My theory is they had already left after the gun fight the day before

1366
01:39:00.64 --> 01:39:04.64
And so we reorientate all our focus to the front

1367
01:39:04.64 --> 01:39:07.64
To keep an eye on the enemy and I can't help but look down

1368
01:39:07.64 --> 01:39:12.64
We had a JTF sniper team directly to our left

1369
01:39:12.64 --> 01:39:16.64
And they left their spotters in place

1370
01:39:16.64 --> 01:39:19.64
And they rest on the rest of them ran down with their medical kids

1371
01:39:19.64 --> 01:39:23.64
And when they were walking away

1372
01:39:23.64 --> 01:39:27.64
Eventually the team you know four guys walk away with a body bag

1373
01:39:27.64 --> 01:39:30.64
And I'm like oh okay that's it

1374
01:39:30.64 --> 01:39:33.64
And then the you know the radio

1375
01:39:33.64 --> 01:39:36.64
You know then that's like yeah we're 10 10 wounded

1376
01:39:36.64 --> 01:39:39.64
Okay to 12 okay 17 is 21

1377
01:39:39.64 --> 01:39:42.64
And then I think we ended up at about 34 35

1378
01:39:42.64 --> 01:39:46.64
So the entire leadership of the company's wiped out

1379
01:39:46.64 --> 01:39:48.64
And with injury

1380
01:39:48.64 --> 01:39:53.64
And that's it that company is now combat and effect

1381
01:39:53.64 --> 01:39:54.64
Yeah, which is

1382
01:39:54.64 --> 01:39:57.64
I mean to hear that in the modern day

1383
01:39:57.64 --> 01:40:00.64
You don't hear that very often combat and effect

1384
01:40:00.64 --> 01:40:02.64
I mean that they can no longer perform their duties

1385
01:40:02.64 --> 01:40:03.64
Yeah, they just don't hear that

1386
01:40:03.64 --> 01:40:05.64
They just don't have enough bodies left

1387
01:40:05.64 --> 01:40:07.64
Like they just didn't have enough soldiers that were still functioning

1388
01:40:07.64 --> 01:40:14.64
And you know we went to Afghanistan in 2002

1389
01:40:14.64 --> 01:40:18.64
With op was an anaconda I believe

1390
01:40:18.64 --> 01:40:29.64
We sent a battalion of Canadian soldiers with and that's where the Canadian snipers set the new record

1391
01:40:29.64 --> 01:40:33.64
Beatying Carlos half cocks that had stood since Vietnam

1392
01:40:33.64 --> 01:40:38.64
But part of that mission was we lost four guys to an American F-16

1393
01:40:38.64 --> 01:40:46.64
And then this happened and people give a lot of shit to the American Air Force or aircraft

1394
01:40:46.64 --> 01:40:49.64
Mistakes happen

1395
01:40:49.64 --> 01:40:53.64
We almost got lit up by our own guys at the beginning of the assault

1396
01:40:53.64 --> 01:40:54.64
You know we didn't talk about it

1397
01:40:54.64 --> 01:40:58.64
But I had to radio and remind them hey guys we're coming in from your flank

1398
01:40:58.64 --> 01:41:01.64
You've looked through thermal I've looked through thermal

1399
01:41:01.64 --> 01:41:05.64
The guys like us look anything like bad guys looking in through thermal

1400
01:41:05.64 --> 01:41:07.64
I don't know how it happens

1401
01:41:07.64 --> 01:41:10.64
Yeah, but guys get so amped up and they're so ready to kill something

1402
01:41:10.64 --> 01:41:12.64
You just don't want it to be you

1403
01:41:12.64 --> 01:41:15.64
Hey in Ramadi there was incidents where

1404
01:41:15.64 --> 01:41:18.64
Humvees engaged other humvees

1405
01:41:18.64 --> 01:41:19.64
Right?

1406
01:41:19.64 --> 01:41:21.64
Because the enemy has no more

1407
01:41:21.64 --> 01:41:23.64
Does he look like anything like a humvee

1408
01:41:23.64 --> 01:41:25.64
No more distinct event in the world in a humvee

1409
01:41:25.64 --> 01:41:27.64
Yeah, especially when you're in the military

1410
01:41:27.64 --> 01:41:34.64
And but that's to your point that's the level of confusion and mayhem and chaos that happens

1411
01:41:34.64 --> 01:41:40.64
And just the mentality of guys when they're scared and all of a sudden they see muzzle flash

1412
01:41:40.64 --> 01:41:44.64
And okay, you know what boom oh I see something over there engaged

1413
01:41:44.64 --> 01:41:48.64
Everything looks like a shovel and someone's hand looks like an AK

1414
01:41:48.64 --> 01:41:54.64
So I don't lay any blame on the American pilot that did this

1415
01:41:54.64 --> 01:42:01.64
He was doing the job he was there to do and someone told him to do something

1416
01:42:01.64 --> 01:42:07.64
And they he cut off the wrong puff of smoke and that's what happened

1417
01:42:07.64 --> 01:42:11.64
You know it was just a literally it was one of those

1418
01:42:11.64 --> 01:42:16.64
It was one of those each little action led to it

1419
01:42:16.64 --> 01:42:19.64
Right, you know from mark lighting the garbage fire

1420
01:42:19.64 --> 01:42:26.64
To to him coming over the mountain and the and the sun is in his eyes

1421
01:42:26.64 --> 01:42:28.64
Amen

1422
01:42:28.64 --> 01:42:31.64
Shit happened a bunch of small mistakes that compound

1423
01:42:31.64 --> 01:42:35.64
And I even mistakes just just such situational actions

1424
01:42:35.64 --> 01:42:39.64
Yeah, that compound and two a tragic situation

1425
01:42:39.64 --> 01:42:44.64
But I when you consider what a strafing run from an eight ten can do

1426
01:42:44.64 --> 01:42:48.64
For us to only have one killed is amazing is incredible

1427
01:42:48.64 --> 01:42:53.64
And and and only you know of those thirty something wounded

1428
01:42:53.64 --> 01:42:55.64
I might not have the right number

1429
01:42:55.64 --> 01:42:57.64
But if I understand correctly

1430
01:42:57.64 --> 01:43:01.64
Maybe it doesn't have to retire due to their injuries

1431
01:43:01.64 --> 01:43:03.64
Maybe

1432
01:43:03.64 --> 01:43:04.64
Crazy

1433
01:43:04.64 --> 01:43:05.64
Yeah

1434
01:43:05.64 --> 01:43:10.64
So you guys continue doing sniper operations

1435
01:43:10.64 --> 01:43:13.64
You guys continue

1436
01:43:13.64 --> 01:43:16.64
Going on missions you support SF you support others

1437
01:43:16.64 --> 01:43:22.64
Lots of really solid missions and now you're out on another operation

1438
01:43:22.64 --> 01:43:27.64
You're patrolling through a village

1439
01:43:27.64 --> 01:43:32.64
And again it's your team that you've been with the whole time

1440
01:43:32.64 --> 01:43:36.64
You're following cash your boy cash

1441
01:43:36.64 --> 01:43:39.64
And I'm going to go to the book here

1442
01:43:39.64 --> 01:43:42.64
Once he was about ten meters ahead

1443
01:43:42.64 --> 01:43:47.64
I turned and took my first step forward

1444
01:43:47.64 --> 01:43:50.64
My right foot touched the ground

1445
01:43:50.64 --> 01:43:55.64
And a massive orange fireball soared across my face

1446
01:43:55.64 --> 01:43:57.64
I didn't hear a sound

1447
01:43:57.64 --> 01:44:03.64
For a few seconds I felt waitless as if I was suspended in space

1448
01:44:03.64 --> 01:44:06.64
The next thing I knew I was on the ground

1449
01:44:06.64 --> 01:44:11.64
My ears nose and mouth tasted like mud

1450
01:44:11.64 --> 01:44:13.64
And that's when the pain hit

1451
01:44:13.64 --> 01:44:18.64
A pain so intense that it completely overwhelmed my body and my silence

1452
01:44:18.64 --> 01:44:20.64
I started punching the ground and screaming

1453
01:44:20.64 --> 01:44:24.64
Oh my god, oh my god it was the only time in my life

1454
01:44:24.64 --> 01:44:27.64
I've ever uttered anything religious

1455
01:44:27.64 --> 01:44:31.64
The blast was so powerful that he had knocked cash down

1456
01:44:31.64 --> 01:44:34.64
And I saw him in the dirt up ahead of me

1457
01:44:34.64 --> 01:44:37.64
For a few seconds I couldn't see barrier guard

1458
01:44:37.64 --> 01:44:41.64
They had probably done what good snipers are supposed to do upon hearing the explosion

1459
01:44:41.64 --> 01:44:44.64
Run for cover and prepare for an ambush

1460
01:44:44.64 --> 01:44:48.64
A few seconds later once they realized what had happened

1461
01:44:48.64 --> 01:44:50.64
They came running back towards me

1462
01:44:50.64 --> 01:44:55.64
So there it is

1463
01:44:55.64 --> 01:44:59.64
Did you know what did you know was an ID?

1464
01:44:59.64 --> 01:45:08.64
Not why

1465
01:45:08.64 --> 01:45:12.64
Could have been RPG, could have been someone there for those of you that don't know

1466
01:45:12.64 --> 01:45:15.64
You don't know big booms are going off

1467
01:45:15.64 --> 01:45:17.64
I didn't hear anything

1468
01:45:17.64 --> 01:45:19.64
Right like I said like

1469
01:45:19.64 --> 01:45:23.64
You're not going to hear the one that gets you from in my case it was real

1470
01:45:23.64 --> 01:45:26.64
But my hearing was fine, there's no ringing

1471
01:45:26.64 --> 01:45:31.64
There is no and I've read Colonel

1472
01:45:31.64 --> 01:45:33.64
Help me out he wrote it on killing

1473
01:45:33.64 --> 01:45:34.64
Oh yeah, yeah

1474
01:45:34.64 --> 01:45:35.64
Yeah

1475
01:45:35.64 --> 01:45:39.64
Anyway, so I know your name I just forget it right now

1476
01:45:39.64 --> 01:45:42.64
And he talks about that in his other book on combat

1477
01:45:42.64 --> 01:45:43.64
Yeah, the little audible

1478
01:45:43.64 --> 01:45:45.64
The body will shut it off

1479
01:45:45.64 --> 01:45:46.64
And it's split second

1480
01:45:46.64 --> 01:45:48.64
But anyway

1481
01:45:48.64 --> 01:45:50.64
I knew I'd done something

1482
01:45:50.64 --> 01:45:52.64
Something bad it happened

1483
01:45:52.64 --> 01:45:57.64
Once I you know my weapon was gone, you know my night vision is gone

1484
01:45:57.64 --> 01:45:58.64
Right

1485
01:45:58.64 --> 01:46:00.64
And the pain was so bad

1486
01:46:00.64 --> 01:46:04.64
And you know it technically was an ID though

1487
01:46:04.64 --> 01:46:07.64
Under the technical definition right because it was a

1488
01:46:07.64 --> 01:46:10.64
An any personal landmine on top of a mortar bottle

1489
01:46:10.64 --> 01:46:12.64
Technically

1490
01:46:12.64 --> 01:46:14.64
We you and I know that's an ID

1491
01:46:14.64 --> 01:46:18.64
But it's really two conventional munitions put together

1492
01:46:18.64 --> 01:46:21.64
And it did exactly what it was supposed to do

1493
01:46:21.64 --> 01:46:23.64
You know

1494
01:46:23.64 --> 01:46:28.64
It just it's one of those

1495
01:46:28.64 --> 01:46:36.64
It's one of those things of war where there's no rhyme or reason about who's going to get wet or when or where

1496
01:46:36.64 --> 01:46:38.64
Because everyone else in your patrol just walked over it

1497
01:46:38.64 --> 01:46:39.64
I was last guy

1498
01:46:39.64 --> 01:46:44.64
I remember the first time I was ever shot

1499
01:46:44.64 --> 01:46:48.64
I was in homebees and I'm going over a bridge and back dad

1500
01:46:48.64 --> 01:46:52.64
And again this is going back to what you were talking about

1501
01:46:52.64 --> 01:46:55.64
Like when you don't really know what's combat's like

1502
01:46:55.64 --> 01:46:58.64
And I'm looking up ahead of me at the home via

1503
01:46:58.64 --> 01:47:02.64
And I see these like someone's throwing cigarettes

1504
01:47:02.64 --> 01:47:03.64
Out the window

1505
01:47:03.64 --> 01:47:04.64
I go

1506
01:47:04.64 --> 01:47:06.64
Who the hell is smoking

1507
01:47:06.64 --> 01:47:07.64
We don't even have any smoke

1508
01:47:07.64 --> 01:47:10.64
Like who's smoking right and how are they smoking at thousands of cigarettes

1509
01:47:10.64 --> 01:47:12.64
I think they're smoking so many cigarettes right now

1510
01:47:12.64 --> 01:47:13.64
And then why are they smoke

1511
01:47:13.64 --> 01:47:17.64
Who why are these things sparking when they hit the the ground over there

1512
01:47:17.64 --> 01:47:18.64
And why is there sparks

1513
01:47:18.64 --> 01:47:19.64
Oh

1514
01:47:19.64 --> 01:47:20.64
Okay

1515
01:47:20.64 --> 01:47:21.64
Newsflas

1516
01:47:21.64 --> 01:47:22.64
We're getting shot

1517
01:47:22.64 --> 01:47:23.64
We're under effective fire

1518
01:47:23.64 --> 01:47:24.64
Yeah

1519
01:47:24.64 --> 01:47:26.64
And it's one of those things

1520
01:47:26.64 --> 01:47:31.64
But my point is that you don't always know what's happening

1521
01:47:31.64 --> 01:47:33.64
And you know in the urban environment

1522
01:47:33.64 --> 01:47:35.64
You didn't know where shots were coming for you

1523
01:47:35.64 --> 01:47:37.64
You're like rounds to be going overhead

1524
01:47:37.64 --> 01:47:39.64
You could not tell where they were coming from

1525
01:47:39.64 --> 01:47:41.64
You know if they're hitting something you can kind of get a general idea

1526
01:47:41.64 --> 01:47:43.64
But you don't always know what's happening

1527
01:47:43.64 --> 01:47:48.64
And all right so now going back to the book here

1528
01:47:48.64 --> 01:47:51.64
My mates were all around me now

1529
01:47:51.64 --> 01:47:56.64
The next hour was the longest of my life

1530
01:47:56.64 --> 01:47:58.64
I was an absolute aggrst agony

1531
01:47:58.64 --> 01:48:00.64
And trying hard to stay positive

1532
01:48:00.64 --> 01:48:04.64
I was also trying hard not to think about the possibility

1533
01:48:04.64 --> 01:48:06.64
Of bleeding out

1534
01:48:06.64 --> 01:48:10.64
With each passing minute I was going weaker and weaker

1535
01:48:10.64 --> 01:48:13.64
Every time I closed my eyes it was harder to open them again

1536
01:48:13.64 --> 01:48:15.64
I knew that if I lost consciousness

1537
01:48:15.64 --> 01:48:17.64
It was over

1538
01:48:17.64 --> 01:48:19.64
Baring gold we're standing over me

1539
01:48:19.64 --> 01:48:22.64
Do you think I'm going to make it

1540
01:48:22.64 --> 01:48:24.64
I asked Gord

1541
01:48:24.64 --> 01:48:26.64
Of course you're going to make it

1542
01:48:26.64 --> 01:48:28.64
Never give up bro

1543
01:48:28.64 --> 01:48:30.64
You know that

1544
01:48:30.64 --> 01:48:32.64
You know that

1545
01:48:38.64 --> 01:48:41.64
And you guys hadn't been to T-Triple C

1546
01:48:41.64 --> 01:48:42.64
None of us

1547
01:48:42.64 --> 01:48:45.64
So for those of you don't know there's something called T-Triple C

1548
01:48:45.64 --> 01:48:47.64
Tactical combat casualty care

1549
01:48:47.64 --> 01:48:49.64
It's a very short course

1550
01:48:49.64 --> 01:48:51.64
That's like maybe a week

1551
01:48:51.64 --> 01:48:54.64
It's two days maybe three days

1552
01:48:54.64 --> 01:48:58.64
Because all the T-TU is how to keep somebody alive

1553
01:48:58.64 --> 01:49:00.64
When this stuff happens

1554
01:49:00.64 --> 01:49:01.64
That's what the goal is

1555
01:49:01.64 --> 01:49:03.64
And it doesn't take a super amount of knowledge

1556
01:49:03.64 --> 01:49:06.64
It takes some concepts

1557
01:49:06.64 --> 01:49:08.64
Number one stop the bleeding

1558
01:49:08.64 --> 01:49:11.64
But none of your guys had been to it

1559
01:49:11.64 --> 01:49:13.64
But they still saved your life

1560
01:49:13.64 --> 01:49:17.64
I mean between Barry Gord and I

1561
01:49:17.64 --> 01:49:20.64
You know like we're all experienced operate

1562
01:49:20.64 --> 01:49:23.64
And we still have enough first aid training

1563
01:49:23.64 --> 01:49:26.64
You know the first thing they did is slap the Ternic it's on

1564
01:49:26.64 --> 01:49:28.64
There you go

1565
01:49:28.64 --> 01:49:30.64
At the arteries and my thighs

1566
01:49:30.64 --> 01:49:33.64
And then they did their best from there

1567
01:49:33.64 --> 01:49:35.64
And we're snipers

1568
01:49:35.64 --> 01:49:36.64
We're not medics

1569
01:49:36.64 --> 01:49:39.64
And we don't bring as awesome as medics are

1570
01:49:39.64 --> 01:49:41.64
They're kind of in the way

1571
01:49:41.64 --> 01:49:43.64
When you're on a sneaky sneaky mission

1572
01:49:43.64 --> 01:49:44.64
That was what we

1573
01:49:44.64 --> 01:49:46.64
That's how we classified our missions

1574
01:49:46.64 --> 01:49:47.64
If they were sneaky sneaky

1575
01:49:47.64 --> 01:49:49.64
Or it's really sneaky sneaky

1576
01:49:49.64 --> 01:49:51.64
If we're really sneaky sneaky

1577
01:49:51.64 --> 01:49:53.64
What's almost going to have bad day

1578
01:49:53.64 --> 01:49:57.64
And this one was a middle sneaky and we were in a spot

1579
01:49:57.64 --> 01:49:59.64
Where there is no Aussie

1580
01:49:59.64 --> 01:50:01.64
You're not getting a vehicle in there

1581
01:50:01.64 --> 01:50:05.64
You know and the closest medic was

1582
01:50:05.64 --> 01:50:09.64
12, 1500 meters away on foot

1583
01:50:09.64 --> 01:50:12.64
At night through an Afghan village

1584
01:50:12.64 --> 01:50:14.64
Hours

1585
01:50:14.64 --> 01:50:15.64
Took him an hour

1586
01:50:15.64 --> 01:50:17.64
The wrecky platoon

1587
01:50:17.64 --> 01:50:18.64
Just thrown on this out there

1588
01:50:18.64 --> 01:50:19.64
They just gave

1589
01:50:19.64 --> 01:50:20.64
They just didn't even wait for it

1590
01:50:20.64 --> 01:50:21.64
They were just coming

1591
01:50:21.64 --> 01:50:23.64
I love those guys

1592
01:50:23.64 --> 01:50:24.64
That's why that's why

1593
01:50:24.64 --> 01:50:25.64
You I had to say

1594
01:50:25.64 --> 01:50:26.64
I love those guys

1595
01:50:26.64 --> 01:50:28.64
I everyone of them that listens

1596
01:50:28.64 --> 01:50:30.64
I love those guys

1597
01:50:30.64 --> 01:50:31.64
100%

1598
01:50:31.64 --> 01:50:33.64
I do anything for them

1599
01:50:33.64 --> 01:50:35.64
So

1600
01:50:35.64 --> 01:50:38.64
They get you

1601
01:50:38.64 --> 01:50:39.64
They do get you out

1602
01:50:39.64 --> 01:50:40.64
Yep

1603
01:50:40.64 --> 01:50:41.64
They

1604
01:50:41.64 --> 01:50:43.64
They put the phone in your hand

1605
01:50:43.64 --> 01:50:45.64
Before you go into surgery

1606
01:50:45.64 --> 01:50:46.64
Right

1607
01:50:46.64 --> 01:50:47.64
So we're back in Canada

1608
01:50:47.64 --> 01:50:51.64
I heard at the hospital and someone hands me a phone

1609
01:50:51.64 --> 01:50:53.64
And

1610
01:50:53.64 --> 01:50:55.64
I forget how it even went

1611
01:50:55.64 --> 01:50:57.64
Like I was on a lot of drugs by this point

1612
01:50:57.64 --> 01:50:59.64
One thing about getting wounded is

1613
01:50:59.64 --> 01:51:01.64
Get to a lot of good drugs

1614
01:51:01.64 --> 01:51:03.64
Here's what you told you dad

1615
01:51:03.64 --> 01:51:04.64
They got me dad

1616
01:51:04.64 --> 01:51:05.64
The towel band

1617
01:51:05.64 --> 01:51:07.64
But I'm alive

1618
01:51:07.64 --> 01:51:08.64
Going into surgery

1619
01:51:08.64 --> 01:51:10.64
I'm going to get through this

1620
01:51:10.64 --> 01:51:11.64
Don't worry

1621
01:51:11.64 --> 01:51:14.64
I can't

1622
01:51:14.64 --> 01:51:16.64
I kind of want to compliment you right now

1623
01:51:16.64 --> 01:51:19.64
Because you always hear

1624
01:51:19.64 --> 01:51:21.64
Of and of

1625
01:51:21.64 --> 01:51:22.64
Do you speak compliment

1626
01:51:22.64 --> 01:51:24.64
Like all my buddies

1627
01:51:24.64 --> 01:51:26.64
Anybody that knows

1628
01:51:26.64 --> 01:51:27.64
They got wounded

1629
01:51:27.64 --> 01:51:28.64
They're like hey don't worry about it

1630
01:51:28.64 --> 01:51:29.64
I would be okay

1631
01:51:29.64 --> 01:51:30.64
Yeah

1632
01:51:30.64 --> 01:51:32.64
And

1633
01:51:32.64 --> 01:51:34.64
At the same time

1634
01:51:34.64 --> 01:51:37.64
You called your dad like dad of wound

1635
01:51:37.64 --> 01:51:38.64
You don't go to the surgery

1636
01:51:38.64 --> 01:51:39.64
Don't worry about it

1637
01:51:39.64 --> 01:51:40.64
Yeah

1638
01:51:40.64 --> 01:51:41.64
You know

1639
01:51:41.64 --> 01:51:43.64
That's probably actually

1640
01:51:43.64 --> 01:51:45.64
What's funny is a mic monster

1641
01:51:45.64 --> 01:51:48.64
Who is one of my guys got killed in

1642
01:51:48.64 --> 01:51:49.64
Ramadi and

1643
01:51:49.64 --> 01:51:51.64
I mean they were in

1644
01:51:51.64 --> 01:51:54.64
Grueling

1645
01:51:54.64 --> 01:51:56.64
Sustained

1646
01:51:56.64 --> 01:51:58.64
Combat every single day

1647
01:51:58.64 --> 01:51:59.64
Firefights

1648
01:51:59.64 --> 01:52:01.64
I mean he went winchester

1649
01:52:01.64 --> 01:52:02.64
On his

1650
01:52:02.64 --> 01:52:04.64
On his heavy machine gun

1651
01:52:04.64 --> 01:52:07.64
So many times that I don't even know

1652
01:52:07.64 --> 01:52:08.64
Like one time

1653
01:52:08.64 --> 01:52:10.64
I was went to visit him

1654
01:52:10.64 --> 01:52:11.64
In their camp

1655
01:52:11.64 --> 01:52:12.64
Because I was on the other side

1656
01:52:12.64 --> 01:52:14.64
Winchester means completely at a ammo

1657
01:52:14.64 --> 01:52:15.64
Oh yeah

1658
01:52:15.64 --> 01:52:15.64
Sorry

1659
01:52:15.64 --> 01:52:16.64
Winchester means you're out of ammo

1660
01:52:16.64 --> 01:52:17.64
So I went to see

1661
01:52:17.64 --> 01:52:18.64
I went to his camp

1662
01:52:18.64 --> 01:52:19.64
Pretty early in deployment

1663
01:52:19.64 --> 01:52:20.64
Maybe

1664
01:52:20.64 --> 01:52:22.64
Three or four weeks in deployment

1665
01:52:22.64 --> 01:52:23.64
And I went over to their camp

1666
01:52:23.64 --> 01:52:25.64
To see how things were going

1667
01:52:25.64 --> 01:52:26.64
And

1668
01:52:26.64 --> 01:52:27.64
Someone's like

1669
01:52:27.64 --> 01:52:28.64
Oh go check out the video

1670
01:52:28.64 --> 01:52:29.64
That mic he made

1671
01:52:29.64 --> 01:52:30.64
And I go

1672
01:52:30.64 --> 01:52:31.64
Okay cool

1673
01:52:31.64 --> 01:52:32.64
And mic he shows me this video

1674
01:52:32.64 --> 01:52:35.64
And it's like a firefight happening

1675
01:52:35.64 --> 01:52:36.64
Yeah

1676
01:52:36.64 --> 01:52:38.64
And he's filming and he's putting

1677
01:52:38.64 --> 01:52:39.64
Stick in the camera

1678
01:52:39.64 --> 01:52:40.64
Up above the wall

1679
01:52:40.64 --> 01:52:42.64
And then he turns it back on himself

1680
01:52:42.64 --> 01:52:43.64
And he says

1681
01:52:43.64 --> 01:52:45.64
The name of the part of town that they were fighting

1682
01:52:45.64 --> 01:52:47.64
And was called the Malab district

1683
01:52:47.64 --> 01:52:49.64
And mic he forwards the camera

1684
01:52:49.64 --> 01:52:50.64
And himself

1685
01:52:50.64 --> 01:52:51.64
And he goes

1686
01:52:51.64 --> 01:52:53.64
It's the Moulin

1687
01:52:53.64 --> 01:52:54.64
And so

1688
01:52:54.64 --> 01:52:56.64
I'm looking at him laughing

1689
01:52:56.64 --> 01:52:57.64
And then you know me being Mr.

1690
01:52:57.64 --> 01:52:58.64
Professional

1691
01:52:58.64 --> 01:52:59.64
And I go

1692
01:52:59.64 --> 01:53:00.64
Hey man

1693
01:53:00.64 --> 01:53:01.64
And he's a new guy

1694
01:53:01.64 --> 01:53:02.64
And I'm you know

1695
01:53:02.64 --> 01:53:03.64
Jockel you know

1696
01:53:03.64 --> 01:53:04.64
And so I go

1697
01:53:04.64 --> 01:53:05.64
Hey man

1698
01:53:05.64 --> 01:53:06.64
I'm filming

1699
01:53:06.64 --> 01:53:07.64
When there's a firefight going on

1700
01:53:07.64 --> 01:53:08.64
I go you need to get your gun up

1701
01:53:08.64 --> 01:53:09.64
I don't want to see this again

1702
01:53:09.64 --> 01:53:10.64
And he's like

1703
01:53:10.64 --> 01:53:12.64
Hey sorry sir

1704
01:53:12.64 --> 01:53:14.64
But I was Winchester

1705
01:53:14.64 --> 01:53:15.64
I go

1706
01:53:15.64 --> 01:53:16.64
All right man

1707
01:53:16.64 --> 01:53:17.64
Film some videos

1708
01:53:17.64 --> 01:53:18.64
That's all you got left

1709
01:53:18.64 --> 01:53:18.64
Be the Hister

1710
01:53:18.64 --> 01:53:19.64
Be the document guy

1711
01:53:19.64 --> 01:53:21.64
And just like in my opinion

1712
01:53:21.64 --> 01:53:22.64
To go Winchester

1713
01:53:22.64 --> 01:53:24.64
For a seal

1714
01:53:24.64 --> 01:53:25.64
If he's anything like

1715
01:53:25.64 --> 01:53:26.64
Like arm machine gunners

1716
01:53:26.64 --> 01:53:28.64
That's pretty tough to do

1717
01:53:28.64 --> 01:53:29.64
Oh yeah

1718
01:53:29.64 --> 01:53:29.64
So

1719
01:53:29.64 --> 01:53:32.64
It's not like mic he wasn't carrying a tone around

1720
01:53:32.64 --> 01:53:32.64
Yeah

1721
01:53:32.64 --> 01:53:33.64
Like I said

1722
01:53:33.64 --> 01:53:34.64
My point of telling this story

1723
01:53:34.64 --> 01:53:36.64
Was that

1724
01:53:36.64 --> 01:53:38.64
You know this was happening on a

1725
01:53:38.64 --> 01:53:39.64
You know fairly regular basis

1726
01:53:39.64 --> 01:53:40.64
Definitely firefight

1727
01:53:40.64 --> 01:53:41.64
He wasn't going Winchester all the time

1728
01:53:41.64 --> 01:53:42.64
But he didn't know

1729
01:53:42.64 --> 01:53:43.64
But I'm just saying like

1730
01:53:43.64 --> 01:53:44.64
Well times

1731
01:53:44.64 --> 01:53:46.64
And he was in

1732
01:53:46.64 --> 01:53:47.64
You know

1733
01:53:47.64 --> 01:53:49.64
Almost daily firefighters

1734
01:53:49.64 --> 01:53:51.64
I remember that

1735
01:53:51.64 --> 01:53:53.64
For to this is an actual number

1736
01:53:53.64 --> 01:53:53.64
So

1737
01:53:53.64 --> 01:53:56.64
The first 24 operations that that

1738
01:53:56.64 --> 01:53:57.64
Element went on

1739
01:53:57.64 --> 01:53:58.64
In a row

1740
01:53:58.64 --> 01:53:59.64
They got to a firefight

1741
01:53:59.64 --> 01:54:00.64
In the city

1742
01:54:00.64 --> 01:54:01.64
Yeah

1743
01:54:01.64 --> 01:54:02.64
And then they had one

1744
01:54:02.64 --> 01:54:03.64
Where they didn't and then they went right back to it again

1745
01:54:03.64 --> 01:54:05.64
So they were getting a lot of firefights

1746
01:54:05.64 --> 01:54:07.64
And in a lot of danger

1747
01:54:07.64 --> 01:54:09.64
And

1748
01:54:09.64 --> 01:54:11.64
When we got home

1749
01:54:11.64 --> 01:54:12.64
When I got home

1750
01:54:12.64 --> 01:54:13.64
And I got to know his family

1751
01:54:13.64 --> 01:54:14.64
A little bit

1752
01:54:14.64 --> 01:54:16.64
His family was saying that when he'd call

1753
01:54:16.64 --> 01:54:17.64
They'd be like

1754
01:54:17.64 --> 01:54:18.64
What are you doing over there

1755
01:54:18.64 --> 01:54:19.64
And he'd say

1756
01:54:19.64 --> 01:54:20.64
Oh we're just training

1757
01:54:20.64 --> 01:54:21.64
Some Iraqi soldiers

1758
01:54:21.64 --> 01:54:21.64
Yeah

1759
01:54:21.64 --> 01:54:23.64
We're just on base

1760
01:54:23.64 --> 01:54:24.64
Just you know

1761
01:54:24.64 --> 01:54:25.64
Don't worry about anything

1762
01:54:25.64 --> 01:54:26.64
It's just fine

1763
01:54:26.64 --> 01:54:28.64
Typical combat soldiers

1764
01:54:28.64 --> 01:54:29.64
Fitting stories

1765
01:54:29.64 --> 01:54:30.64
To the family

1766
01:54:30.64 --> 01:54:32.64
Typical badass

1767
01:54:32.64 --> 01:54:33.64
Yeah

1768
01:54:33.64 --> 01:54:34.64
So that reminds me of you

1769
01:54:34.64 --> 01:54:36.64
Don't worry about it

1770
01:54:36.64 --> 01:54:37.64
You just got blown up

1771
01:54:37.64 --> 01:54:38.64
Yeah

1772
01:54:38.64 --> 01:54:39.64
Yeah

1773
01:54:39.64 --> 01:54:39.64
Yeah

1774
01:54:39.64 --> 01:54:40.64
Yeah

1775
01:54:40.64 --> 01:54:41.64
Then

1776
01:54:41.64 --> 01:54:43.64
Here we go

1777
01:54:43.64 --> 01:54:44.64
I woke up with a doctor

1778
01:54:44.64 --> 01:54:46.64
Looming over me

1779
01:54:46.64 --> 01:54:47.64
Took a few moments

1780
01:54:47.64 --> 01:54:49.64
For the anesthetics to wear off

1781
01:54:49.64 --> 01:54:50.64
And for me to remember

1782
01:54:50.64 --> 01:54:53.64
Where I was and what was going on

1783
01:54:53.64 --> 01:54:55.64
Then it came back to me

1784
01:54:55.64 --> 01:54:56.64
In a rush

1785
01:54:56.64 --> 01:54:57.64
The mission

1786
01:54:57.64 --> 01:54:59.64
The landmine, the pain, the surgery

1787
01:54:59.64 --> 01:55:01.64
The surgeon standing

1788
01:55:01.64 --> 01:55:02.64
By my bed

1789
01:55:02.64 --> 01:55:03.64
Put it to me bluntly

1790
01:55:03.64 --> 01:55:06.64
I had to cut off both your feet

1791
01:55:11.64 --> 01:55:12.64
Boom

1792
01:55:12.64 --> 01:55:15.64
I believe earlier

1793
01:55:15.64 --> 01:55:17.64
We were talking about

1794
01:55:17.64 --> 01:55:19.64
Irreversible situations

1795
01:55:19.64 --> 01:55:20.64
Yep

1796
01:55:20.64 --> 01:55:21.64
And here you were

1797
01:55:25.64 --> 01:55:27.64
Was that real to you at that time?

1798
01:55:27.64 --> 01:55:29.64
Yeah

1799
01:55:29.64 --> 01:55:31.64
Or would you basically

1800
01:55:31.64 --> 01:55:32.64
Hey

1801
01:55:32.64 --> 01:55:34.64
I'm happy I'm alive

1802
01:55:34.64 --> 01:55:36.64
Like I got a seal buddy

1803
01:55:36.64 --> 01:55:39.64
That got blown up

1804
01:55:39.64 --> 01:55:40.64
Yeah

1805
01:55:40.64 --> 01:55:42.64
And

1806
01:55:42.64 --> 01:55:43.64
And actually didn't get blown up

1807
01:55:43.64 --> 01:55:44.64
You got shot

1808
01:55:44.64 --> 01:55:45.64
And

1809
01:55:45.64 --> 01:55:46.64
Anyways

1810
01:55:46.64 --> 01:55:48.64
One of my buddies was talking to him

1811
01:55:48.64 --> 01:55:50.64
And he's like a bro

1812
01:55:50.64 --> 01:55:51.64
And

1813
01:55:51.64 --> 01:55:53.64
I'm really sorry about

1814
01:55:53.64 --> 01:55:53.64
You know

1815
01:55:53.64 --> 01:55:54.64
Because he lost his leg

1816
01:55:54.64 --> 01:55:55.64
He was wrong

1817
01:55:55.64 --> 01:55:57.64
He was sorry about your leg

1818
01:55:57.64 --> 01:55:58.64
You know

1819
01:55:58.64 --> 01:55:59.64
And he goes

1820
01:55:59.64 --> 01:56:00.64
Fuck my leg

1821
01:56:00.64 --> 01:56:02.64
I'm happy to be alive

1822
01:56:02.64 --> 01:56:03.64
And

1823
01:56:03.64 --> 01:56:04.64
I got to be honest

1824
01:56:04.64 --> 01:56:05.64
I didn't think that

1825
01:56:05.64 --> 01:56:06.64
Yeah

1826
01:56:06.64 --> 01:56:07.64
Um

1827
01:56:07.64 --> 01:56:10.64
Soul drink is done on your feet

1828
01:56:10.64 --> 01:56:12.64
And I immediately went

1829
01:56:12.64 --> 01:56:14.64
Into defensive

1830
01:56:14.64 --> 01:56:15.64
Mode

1831
01:56:15.64 --> 01:56:16.64
I

1832
01:56:16.64 --> 01:56:18.64
Half my brain said

1833
01:56:18.64 --> 01:56:19.64
You tell that

1834
01:56:19.64 --> 01:56:21.64
Fucking guy to go back

1835
01:56:21.64 --> 01:56:22.64
And get that

1836
01:56:22.64 --> 01:56:24.64
One of the feet

1837
01:56:24.64 --> 01:56:26.64
And put it back

1838
01:56:26.64 --> 01:56:28.64
And the other half is saying

1839
01:56:28.64 --> 01:56:30.64
He's a pro

1840
01:56:30.64 --> 01:56:31.64
He knows what he's doing

1841
01:56:31.64 --> 01:56:32.64
If he took

1842
01:56:32.64 --> 01:56:34.64
Because we knew one was gone

1843
01:56:34.64 --> 01:56:35.64
On the scene

1844
01:56:35.64 --> 01:56:36.64
That was the one that detonated

1845
01:56:36.64 --> 01:56:37.64
The device

1846
01:56:37.64 --> 01:56:39.64
The landmine did exactly what it was supposed to do

1847
01:56:39.64 --> 01:56:41.64
It blew my foot off

1848
01:56:41.64 --> 01:56:43.64
The mortar bomb shredded

1849
01:56:43.64 --> 01:56:44.64
My other foot

1850
01:56:44.64 --> 01:56:46.64
And on the scene

1851
01:56:46.64 --> 01:56:48.64
I remember as I was

1852
01:56:48.64 --> 01:56:49.64
Getting put onto the structure

1853
01:56:49.64 --> 01:56:51.64
And getting put onto the ambulance

1854
01:56:51.64 --> 01:56:53.64
That was finally able to get to us

1855
01:56:53.64 --> 01:56:55.64
Because they literally

1856
01:56:55.64 --> 01:56:58.64
Plowed a road to me with a combat bulldozer

1857
01:56:58.64 --> 01:57:00.64
And had the ambulance behind it

1858
01:57:00.64 --> 01:57:01.64
Um

1859
01:57:01.64 --> 01:57:02.64
The medic

1860
01:57:02.64 --> 01:57:03.64
From Recky Platoon said

1861
01:57:03.64 --> 01:57:05.64
Hey man, your left foot

1862
01:57:05.64 --> 01:57:07.64
We got it back into place

1863
01:57:07.64 --> 01:57:08.64
Looks like it might be okay

1864
01:57:08.64 --> 01:57:09.64
So

1865
01:57:09.64 --> 01:57:10.64
But your right foot's gone

1866
01:57:10.64 --> 01:57:11.64
I'm like, okay

1867
01:57:11.64 --> 01:57:12.64
Whatever

1868
01:57:12.64 --> 01:57:13.64
Again at this point I'm like

1869
01:57:13.64 --> 01:57:14.64
So out of it

1870
01:57:14.64 --> 01:57:15.64
So when I woke up

1871
01:57:15.64 --> 01:57:16.64
And he says

1872
01:57:16.64 --> 01:57:16.64
Yeah

1873
01:57:16.64 --> 01:57:18.64
You know I had to take both feet

1874
01:57:18.64 --> 01:57:19.64
Huh?

1875
01:57:19.64 --> 01:57:21.64
Hmm

1876
01:57:21.64 --> 01:57:24.64
And in my mind

1877
01:57:24.64 --> 01:57:25.64
I'm thinking like, well

1878
01:57:25.64 --> 01:57:26.64
How am I going to

1879
01:57:26.64 --> 01:57:28.64
How am I going to do this job?

1880
01:57:28.64 --> 01:57:31.64
Okay

1881
01:57:31.64 --> 01:57:32.64
And then so then I go

1882
01:57:32.64 --> 01:57:35.64
And depending on who's

1883
01:57:35.64 --> 01:57:37.64
Manual you're reading

1884
01:57:37.64 --> 01:57:38.64
Or which doctor wrote it

1885
01:57:38.64 --> 01:57:40.64
There's certain number of steps

1886
01:57:40.64 --> 01:57:41.64
To grieving

1887
01:57:41.64 --> 01:57:43.64
And they say losing a part

1888
01:57:43.64 --> 01:57:44.64
A body part is like

1889
01:57:44.64 --> 01:57:46.64
Losing a family member or something

1890
01:57:46.64 --> 01:57:48.64
So now I'm dealing with two deaths

1891
01:57:48.64 --> 01:57:49.64
And the family

1892
01:57:49.64 --> 01:57:52.64
And the first step is always denial

1893
01:57:52.64 --> 01:57:53.64
And you know

1894
01:57:53.64 --> 01:57:54.64
And I'm like, ah well

1895
01:57:54.64 --> 01:57:56.64
It's 2007

1896
01:57:56.64 --> 01:57:57.64
You know how awesome

1897
01:57:57.64 --> 01:57:58.64
You know guys are going to be jealous

1898
01:57:58.64 --> 01:57:59.64
I had my legs blown off

1899
01:57:59.64 --> 01:58:00.64
I'm going to be like

1900
01:58:00.64 --> 01:58:01.64
Rob I'm going to be like

1901
01:58:01.64 --> 01:58:02.64
Astroboy

1902
01:58:02.64 --> 01:58:03.64
Be flying around

1903
01:58:03.64 --> 01:58:04.64
And shit

1904
01:58:04.64 --> 01:58:06.64
I'll have like Robo Coplegs or something

1905
01:58:06.64 --> 01:58:07.64
It's cool

1906
01:58:07.64 --> 01:58:08.64
It's 2007

1907
01:58:08.64 --> 01:58:09.64
Right? Everything's digital

1908
01:58:09.64 --> 01:58:10.64
Um

1909
01:58:10.64 --> 01:58:12.64
And I kind of

1910
01:58:12.64 --> 01:58:14.64
Whether it was the drugs

1911
01:58:14.64 --> 01:58:16.64
And or the endorphins

1912
01:58:16.64 --> 01:58:18.64
From going through all that

1913
01:58:18.64 --> 01:58:20.64
First

1914
01:58:20.64 --> 01:58:21.64
Until I was out of

1915
01:58:21.64 --> 01:58:24.64
Candahar that was my attitude

1916
01:58:24.64 --> 01:58:27.64
You know right up to the boys all came in

1917
01:58:27.64 --> 01:58:29.64
To see me off because we went from

1918
01:58:29.64 --> 01:58:32.64
So I think I spent another day in Candahar

1919
01:58:32.64 --> 01:58:34.64
They flew me to Bagrum

1920
01:58:34.64 --> 01:58:36.64
And then I flew to Kuwait

1921
01:58:36.64 --> 01:58:37.64
And then from Kuwait

1922
01:58:37.64 --> 01:58:39.64
On to

1923
01:58:39.64 --> 01:58:40.64
Germany

1924
01:58:40.64 --> 01:58:41.64
Yeah but

1925
01:58:41.64 --> 01:58:43.64
Lange to Longstool

1926
01:58:43.64 --> 01:58:45.64
And so every stop that we picked up

1927
01:58:45.64 --> 01:58:47.64
Moved American

1928
01:58:47.64 --> 01:58:48.64
Serviceman

1929
01:58:48.64 --> 01:58:50.64
And I think there was one other Canadian

1930
01:58:50.64 --> 01:58:51.64
But

1931
01:58:51.64 --> 01:58:52.64
So

1932
01:58:52.64 --> 01:58:54.64
I just

1933
01:58:54.64 --> 01:58:55.64
You know that's how I felt

1934
01:58:55.64 --> 01:58:56.64
Right?

1935
01:58:56.64 --> 01:58:58.64
And then once I was in Germany

1936
01:58:58.64 --> 01:59:00.64
Um

1937
01:59:00.64 --> 01:59:07.64
I was just trying to deal with every day by day

1938
01:59:07.64 --> 01:59:08.64
You know

1939
01:59:08.64 --> 01:59:10.64
I just was

1940
01:59:10.64 --> 01:59:13.64
You know they put me in a room with another guy

1941
01:59:13.64 --> 01:59:15.64
Who had been hit in an IED strike on a

1942
01:59:15.64 --> 01:59:17.64
So a lab you were saying L.A.

1943
01:59:17.64 --> 01:59:19.64
V. earlier so those are the

1944
01:59:19.64 --> 01:59:21.64
Marine Corps has an act of some L.A. V.

1945
01:59:21.64 --> 01:59:22.64
So that's why I was calling it that.

1946
01:59:22.64 --> 01:59:24.64
Yeah so it's lighter armored vehicle

1947
01:59:24.64 --> 01:59:27.64
And you guys in the army here they're called

1948
01:59:27.64 --> 01:59:28.64
Strikers

1949
01:59:28.64 --> 01:59:29.64
Except

1950
01:59:29.64 --> 01:59:31.64
R is have turrets and I think yours has like

1951
01:59:31.64 --> 01:59:33.64
Remote 50 cows or something

1952
01:59:33.64 --> 01:59:35.64
They're all made in London Ontario

1953
01:59:35.64 --> 01:59:37.64
Candahar by the way

1954
01:59:37.64 --> 01:59:39.64
Um

1955
01:59:39.64 --> 01:59:41.64
So

1956
01:59:41.64 --> 01:59:42.64
Yeah I was just trying to deal with each day

1957
01:59:42.64 --> 01:59:43.64
As it can't because now I'm

1958
01:59:43.64 --> 01:59:46.64
I've never there's no training for this

1959
01:59:46.64 --> 01:59:47.64
Right?

1960
01:59:47.64 --> 01:59:49.64
And casual decimulation

1961
01:59:49.64 --> 01:59:51.64
It stops once you're declared dead

1962
01:59:51.64 --> 01:59:53.64
Or evacuated right?

1963
01:59:53.64 --> 01:59:55.64
So now I'm in a stage where I'm like

1964
01:59:55.64 --> 01:59:57.64
Okay I'm in a room with another Canadian dude

1965
01:59:57.64 --> 01:59:59.64
Um

1966
01:59:59.64 --> 02:00:01.64
And American army hospital

1967
02:00:01.64 --> 02:00:03.64
And

1968
02:00:03.64 --> 02:00:05.64
I don't know

1969
02:00:05.64 --> 02:00:07.64
What's next?

1970
02:00:07.64 --> 02:00:10.64
And every time I look down

1971
02:00:10.64 --> 02:00:12.64
There's no toes to wiggle

1972
02:00:12.64 --> 02:00:16.64
It was just so I'm like okay

1973
02:00:16.64 --> 02:00:18.64
Well I'm just going to try and deal with this

1974
02:00:18.64 --> 02:00:20.64
Just deal with it

1975
02:00:20.64 --> 02:00:21.64
Just deal with it

1976
02:00:21.64 --> 02:00:25.64
And I was in that mode for weeks

1977
02:00:25.64 --> 02:00:27.64
Yeah

1978
02:00:27.64 --> 02:00:29.64
I'm waiting

1979
02:00:29.64 --> 02:00:31.64
I think I was waiting for a point

1980
02:00:31.64 --> 02:00:34.64
Where someone was going to give me my diagnosis

1981
02:00:34.64 --> 02:00:36.64
You know or my

1982
02:00:36.64 --> 02:00:39.64
The conclusion

1983
02:00:39.64 --> 02:00:42.64
Or like a prescription like okay here's what you're going to do now

1984
02:00:42.64 --> 02:00:45.64
This is what not just with your legs but with your life

1985
02:00:45.64 --> 02:00:46.64
Yeah this is what's going to happen

1986
02:00:46.64 --> 02:00:48.64
You're going to do this you're going to follow these steps

1987
02:00:48.64 --> 02:00:52.64
And at the end you'll be deploying back to Afghanistan

1988
02:00:52.64 --> 02:00:54.64
Which is how it was going to my mind

1989
02:00:54.64 --> 02:00:57.64
You know I don't know what you're going to read next

1990
02:00:57.64 --> 02:00:59.64
But I was convinced

1991
02:00:59.64 --> 02:01:01.64
I'm going to back out guys

1992
02:01:01.64 --> 02:01:03.64
That's it like

1993
02:01:03.64 --> 02:01:06.64
That's it

1994
02:01:06.64 --> 02:01:10.64
Whenever you know the Navy or the Army wants to know something they send you on course

1995
02:01:10.64 --> 02:01:13.64
So you know I was on snab or course and then you go on

1996
02:01:13.64 --> 02:01:15.64
You go on driver course you go on

1997
02:01:15.64 --> 02:01:18.64
Tactically carry course, teach triple C

1998
02:01:18.64 --> 02:01:21.64
So as you're saying this that's actually the next portion

1999
02:01:21.64 --> 02:01:22.64
Yeah

2000
02:01:22.64 --> 02:01:23.64
That I was going to really good

2001
02:01:23.64 --> 02:01:23.64
Okay

2002
02:01:23.64 --> 02:01:25.64
Here you go exactly what you were just about to get into

2003
02:01:25.64 --> 02:01:28.64
From that point on I made it my mission to learn to walk again

2004
02:01:28.64 --> 02:01:30.64
I treated rehab like a military course

2005
02:01:30.64 --> 02:01:33.64
When the military wants a soldier to learn something

2006
02:01:33.64 --> 02:01:37.64
They send him on a course so as the approach I took with my rehab

2007
02:01:37.64 --> 02:01:39.64
The mission mindset right there

2008
02:01:41.64 --> 02:01:43.64
But at the same time

2009
02:01:43.64 --> 02:01:48.64
And now we start going into the fact that it was obvious that the military system

2010
02:01:48.64 --> 02:01:52.64
The military system just couldn't quite cope with my needs

2011
02:01:52.64 --> 02:01:56.64
Sure I was offered help with all sorts of things from rehab to finding a home

2012
02:01:56.64 --> 02:02:01.64
But no one truly understood the needs that are particular to a returning soldier

2013
02:02:01.64 --> 02:02:03.64
And neither did I

2014
02:02:03.64 --> 02:02:05.64
No

2015
02:02:07.64 --> 02:02:13.64
So you didn't even know I mean how do you know that but that's what I'm saying how can you know there's no course for that

2016
02:02:13.64 --> 02:02:16.64
There's no course there's no course there's no training

2017
02:02:19.64 --> 02:02:23.64
You know and and our military medical system was

2018
02:02:23.64 --> 02:02:25.64
Like like the

2019
02:02:25.64 --> 02:02:30.64
We have lots of medics we have doctors for things like spring dangles and

2020
02:02:30.64 --> 02:02:35.64
And you know you hurt your back on a rock march whatever whatever

2021
02:02:35.64 --> 02:02:38.64
Lots of guys and girls to do that

2022
02:02:38.64 --> 02:02:41.64
No you know our physiotherapists we got physiotherapists

2023
02:02:41.64 --> 02:02:45.64
But they've been dealing with tennis elbow and spring dangles for 40 years

2024
02:02:45.64 --> 02:02:46.64
And let's know

2025
02:02:46.64 --> 02:02:48.64
Detachment to them

2026
02:02:48.64 --> 02:02:49.64
It's not their fault

2027
02:02:49.64 --> 02:02:50.64
It's

2028
02:02:50.64 --> 02:02:53.64
They just that's the military that they were in

2029
02:02:53.64 --> 02:02:58.64
And you compare that in the book you talk about when you went to the Center for a trip in San Antonio

2030
02:02:58.64 --> 02:03:01.64
And now you had the American system which has been

2031
02:03:01.64 --> 02:03:03.64
Unfortunately

2032
02:03:03.64 --> 02:03:05.64
Dealing with

2033
02:03:05.64 --> 02:03:08.64
Thousands and thousands and thousands

2034
02:03:08.64 --> 02:03:10.64
Yeah of wounded soldiers

2035
02:03:10.64 --> 02:03:14.64
For at that point I guess for you guys about four five years

2036
02:03:14.64 --> 02:03:16.64
Okay four five years

2037
02:03:16.64 --> 02:03:18.64
Well it was oh well oh seven yeah

2038
02:03:18.64 --> 02:03:21.64
And I guess you guys started in 01 right after that

2039
02:03:21.64 --> 02:03:21.64
Yep

2040
02:03:21.64 --> 02:03:25.64
I don't whoever whenever the guys first went in after the towers dropped

2041
02:03:25.64 --> 02:03:30.64
And so they had experience and they have giant amount of money

2042
02:03:30.64 --> 02:03:35.64
I mean this is America and we do have a lot of money and they put a lot of money into it

2043
02:03:35.64 --> 02:03:40.64
And and at the same time you had some Canadian folks that were like

2044
02:03:40.64 --> 02:03:41.64
We don't need that kind of stuff

2045
02:03:41.64 --> 02:03:43.64
You don't need those kind of things for rehab

2046
02:03:43.64 --> 02:03:47.64
Right right well again I'm you know we have

2047
02:03:47.64 --> 02:03:51.64
I'm trying to think of a correlation here

2048
02:03:51.64 --> 02:03:55.64
But anyway we had these physiotherapists it's a trade in the military

2049
02:03:55.64 --> 02:04:01.64
You're your military physiotherapist and your job is to rehab guys like me

2050
02:04:01.64 --> 02:04:06.64
And I'm telling you you can't do it or you I'm telling you that you're failing

2051
02:04:06.64 --> 02:04:11.64
And this is why so your reaction is going to be well I know I do my job

2052
02:04:11.64 --> 02:04:15.64
And I don't so I don't at the time I was furious

2053
02:04:15.64 --> 02:04:17.64
In retrospect

2054
02:04:17.64 --> 02:04:19.64
They didn't know any better

2055
02:04:19.64 --> 02:04:22.64
And that's why I started advocating so hard

2056
02:04:22.64 --> 02:04:24.64
I got because I got home

2057
02:04:24.64 --> 02:04:26.64
And I said this is what we got to do

2058
02:04:26.64 --> 02:04:29.64
There's not that many guys like me coming home

2059
02:04:29.64 --> 02:04:33.64
I mean yeah there's a lot more than there were last year because we're actually at war

2060
02:04:33.64 --> 02:04:39.64
The center for the intrepid Walter Reed and I believe there's one here the naval medical

2061
02:04:39.64 --> 02:04:40.64
Is that yeah

2062
02:04:40.64 --> 02:04:43.64
Medical center bubble and there's Bethesda as well so

2063
02:04:43.64 --> 02:04:45.64
Well I've heard of three

2064
02:04:45.64 --> 02:04:47.64
San Antonio Walter Reed and the one here

2065
02:04:47.64 --> 02:04:54.64
Those are the biggies yeah those are the ones where most of the traumatic injuries have been going from from from you guys

2066
02:04:54.64 --> 02:04:56.64
So I said

2067
02:04:56.64 --> 02:05:03.64
Let's start sending a pair of physiotherapists down with like for every physiotherapist we send down or for every two casualties

2068
02:05:03.64 --> 02:05:04.64
We send down

2069
02:05:04.64 --> 02:05:07.64
Let's send down one of our physiotherapists and in six months

2070
02:05:07.64 --> 02:05:13.64
That physiotherapist will get more experience dealing with more injuries at

2071
02:05:13.64 --> 02:05:17.64
With more patients and they could ever hope for on base pedoawa

2072
02:05:17.64 --> 02:05:24.64
Where tuber gate is because we're talking the difference between a couple of dozen soldiers getting hurt playing rugby

2073
02:05:24.64 --> 02:05:27.64
Or whatever or ruck marching versus

2074
02:05:27.64 --> 02:05:35.64
Actually, yeah like a parade of guys getting smashed and IED strikes and air you know whatever was happening

2075
02:05:35.64 --> 02:05:41.64
You know I was standing there in the guy who ran Antonio at the San Antonio at the time was

2076
02:05:41.64 --> 02:05:44.64
He was in green beret

2077
02:05:44.64 --> 02:05:48.64
Fidio therapist so I don't know if he was one and then the other or how it worked

2078
02:05:48.64 --> 02:05:55.64
But so he's the lead physiotherapist and I remember this Marine walked into the room

2079
02:05:55.64 --> 02:06:01.64
And he had both legs gone above the knee so he's on the taller leg prosthetics

2080
02:06:01.64 --> 02:06:06.64
And he was blinded by it because he had been burned or whatever

2081
02:06:06.64 --> 02:06:13.64
And this guy he's in full uniform he like screams the guy's name he's like goons and he tackles him

2082
02:06:13.64 --> 02:06:20.64
And they start wrestling and I'm like yeah I want that because the hospital I was in

2083
02:06:20.64 --> 02:06:24.64
And again no offense to the hospital I got great medical care

2084
02:06:24.64 --> 02:06:28.64
For the standard

2085
02:06:28.64 --> 02:06:31.64
To their capabilities

2086
02:06:31.64 --> 02:06:37.64
And it it's not like it was bad but it wasn't what would have been best for me

2087
02:06:37.64 --> 02:06:44.64
Me being a soldier so I'm like because I'm in a hospital where it's knee and hip replacements and amputations from diabetes

2088
02:06:44.64 --> 02:06:50.64
So as a lot of older people I was probably one of the youngest people in the hospital at 30

2089
02:06:50.64 --> 02:06:53.64
I was definitely in the best shape

2090
02:06:53.64 --> 02:06:56.64
You know like I remember my first physiotherapy session

2091
02:06:56.64 --> 02:07:01.64
She hands me a four pound bean bag weight with a strap on it

2092
02:07:01.64 --> 02:07:09.64
She says oh I strap that around your leg and you know trying to like you know maybe maybe 15 or 20 leg raises

2093
02:07:09.64 --> 02:07:12.64
If you think you can and I'm like

2094
02:07:12.64 --> 02:07:13.64
Uh-huh

2095
02:07:13.64 --> 02:07:15.64
Where's the squat rack here

2096
02:07:15.64 --> 02:07:20.64
So I strap it I'm like four pounds is that enough and she's like oh yeah

2097
02:07:20.64 --> 02:07:23.64
We don't want to start too hard nice sweet lady great person

2098
02:07:23.64 --> 02:07:25.64
I love her the best she can she's what she knows

2099
02:07:25.64 --> 02:07:27.64
She's doing what she knows

2100
02:07:27.64 --> 02:07:31.64
I strap the thing to my stump and I start doing leg raises

2101
02:07:31.64 --> 02:07:33.64
And she comes back like 10 minutes later

2102
02:07:33.64 --> 02:07:35.64
She's like so how many did you get done? I'm like

2103
02:07:35.64 --> 02:07:37.64
I don't know

2104
02:07:37.64 --> 02:07:41.64
I'm wondering how much maybe 250 she's like oh oh

2105
02:07:41.64 --> 02:07:45.64
And I'm like yeah, I'm in shape

2106
02:07:45.64 --> 02:07:48.64
It was just meat and bone smash like I don't have any other injuries here

2107
02:07:48.64 --> 02:07:51.64
But there it's San Antonio

2108
02:07:51.64 --> 02:07:58.64
The lead therapist is tackling and wrestling with a blind legless marine and I'm like that's what I need

2109
02:07:58.64 --> 02:08:04.64
I need to be around soldiers and people who know how I think and I can't help

2110
02:08:04.64 --> 02:08:09.64
Again, and I'm not trying to criticize or or be overly

2111
02:08:09.64 --> 02:08:11.64
Um

2112
02:08:11.64 --> 02:08:14.64
Determental to the results of what came

2113
02:08:14.64 --> 02:08:18.64
But imagine if I had had that treatment

2114
02:08:18.64 --> 02:08:23.64
What you know people would say oh jodey you did fine you did great you're the poster boy

2115
02:08:23.64 --> 02:08:25.64
Imagine if I had been in San Antonio

2116
02:08:25.64 --> 02:08:31.64
You know where could have ate faster you think not well

2117
02:08:31.64 --> 02:08:35.64
The level of expectation where I was was very very low

2118
02:08:35.64 --> 02:08:38.64
So they didn't like so if I had been in San Antonio

2119
02:08:38.64 --> 02:08:41.64
They'd been like well, no, no, you will be walking by March

2120
02:08:41.64 --> 02:08:43.64
You will do this and you whereas

2121
02:08:43.64 --> 02:08:47.64
Where I was because that's how they do it

2122
02:08:47.64 --> 02:08:51.64
It's like well we'll see where you're at you know and this and that and there is no

2123
02:08:51.64 --> 02:08:58.64
There's no one for me to mentor under or be you know like there's no one to be compared to or should be compared to

2124
02:08:58.64 --> 02:09:01.64
Look at this guy over here he's grappling with another dude

2125
02:09:01.64 --> 02:09:03.64
Even though he's blind is missing a leg

2126
02:09:03.64 --> 02:09:05.64
Yeah, and are you ready to get it on?

2127
02:09:05.64 --> 02:09:09.64
Yeah, you know another guy came in I think he was a marine too

2128
02:09:09.64 --> 02:09:12.64
And he was wearing just like a t-shirt

2129
02:09:12.64 --> 02:09:14.64
And the same guy is like hey

2130
02:09:14.64 --> 02:09:16.64
Where's your issue PT kit?

2131
02:09:16.64 --> 02:09:18.64
The Marine Corps doesn't play around

2132
02:09:18.64 --> 02:09:21.64
And this was the green break guy right but he's but

2133
02:09:21.64 --> 02:09:26.64
Because it's a mixed force right there's Air Force Navy Marine whoever's there

2134
02:09:26.64 --> 02:09:30.64
There was a there is a Navy I believe she was Navy EOD had her arms blown off

2135
02:09:30.64 --> 02:09:35.64
And she was recently in that range 15 movie I think it's the same girl

2136
02:09:35.64 --> 02:09:40.64
I've only met one girl who had both her arms blown off by by an EOD by an IED

2137
02:09:40.64 --> 02:09:43.64
But so I imagine it's her but anyway

2138
02:09:43.64 --> 02:09:48.64
He expected you to be a soldier regardless of what happened to you

2139
02:09:48.64 --> 02:09:52.64
You're gonna maintain that persona son and I was like yeah

2140
02:09:52.64 --> 02:09:56.64
Because I could feel myself slipping at this other place because there's no expectations

2141
02:09:56.64 --> 02:10:00.64
You know and you can only self-mote

2142
02:10:00.64 --> 02:10:05.64
And having never had my legs blown off before

2143
02:10:05.64 --> 02:10:11.64
I could only me self-mote of eight to a point for so long

2144
02:10:11.64 --> 02:10:16.64
And be the guy, be my own drill surgeon and be my own

2145
02:10:16.64 --> 02:10:21.64
And be my own inspector and there's a reason and I say this all the time

2146
02:10:21.64 --> 02:10:26.64
There's a reason why the best athletes in the world have coaches

2147
02:10:26.64 --> 02:10:27.64
Yeah

2148
02:10:27.64 --> 02:10:31.64
That's the fact that somebody has got to show you the way

2149
02:10:31.64 --> 02:10:32.64
Yeah

2150
02:10:32.64 --> 02:10:34.64
And furthermore you can only push yourself so hard

2151
02:10:34.64 --> 02:10:39.64
I know for a fact you can only push yourself to a hundred and seven percent

2152
02:10:39.64 --> 02:10:43.64
A coach is gonna get you to a hundred and seventeen percent

2153
02:10:43.64 --> 02:10:44.64
Yeah

2154
02:10:44.64 --> 02:10:46.64
Push you a little bit harder to have no mercy

2155
02:10:46.64 --> 02:10:48.64
And so that's what you need, that's what everybody's

2156
02:10:48.64 --> 02:10:49.64
Yeah

2157
02:10:49.64 --> 02:10:55.64
You know and so but again I try to give credit where credits do and give

2158
02:10:55.64 --> 02:10:58.64
You know people were worried when I wrote the book

2159
02:10:58.64 --> 02:11:00.64
There were people I heard that were worried

2160
02:11:00.64 --> 02:11:02.64
And I'm not I don't want to shit on anyone

2161
02:11:02.64 --> 02:11:05.64
And I don't want it to seem like I'm blaming anyone for anything

2162
02:11:05.64 --> 02:11:10.64
I put myself there I'm the one that wanted to be in that spot to step on that landline

2163
02:11:10.64 --> 02:11:16.64
My only expectation was that others would have put the preparation into their mission

2164
02:11:16.64 --> 02:11:22.64
As I put into mine and I do feel that there were some at very high levels

2165
02:11:22.64 --> 02:11:26.64
That maybe didn't take things as seriously as they should have

2166
02:11:26.64 --> 02:11:30.64
Or realized the consequences of what was coming

2167
02:11:30.64 --> 02:11:35.64
And take best practices from places like Walter Reed San Antonio

2168
02:11:35.64 --> 02:11:40.64
Because when I said San me to San Antonio and send a Canadian physiotherapist with me

2169
02:11:40.64 --> 02:11:43.64
And she's gonna learn in the three or six months

2170
02:11:43.64 --> 02:11:47.64
I'm there more than she will in twenty years at any Canadian base

2171
02:11:47.64 --> 02:11:51.64
It was oh well we appreciate that medic

2172
02:11:51.64 --> 02:11:54.64
But you know we're working on a Canadian solution

2173
02:11:54.64 --> 02:11:57.64
And I was like well that's gonna be awesome

2174
02:11:57.64 --> 02:12:00.64
Once you figure out whatever the fuck that is what about me

2175
02:12:00.64 --> 02:12:05.64
I'm talking about right this second we have a facility willing to take us

2176
02:12:05.64 --> 02:12:08.64
So did they send PT's down there?

2177
02:12:08.64 --> 02:12:09.64
No

2178
02:12:09.64 --> 02:12:13.64
Because here's here's the back room stuff

2179
02:12:13.64 --> 02:12:14.64
The politics

2180
02:12:14.64 --> 02:12:20.64
Joe what would the civilians think if we were sending our soldiers to a different country's medical centers

2181
02:12:20.64 --> 02:12:23.64
When we got hospitals right here

2182
02:12:23.64 --> 02:12:30.64
Now again what we were getting at the hospital was not bad care

2183
02:12:30.64 --> 02:12:33.64
You know what I'm saying?

2184
02:12:33.64 --> 02:12:35.64
Do you understand the distinction trying to make it?

2185
02:12:35.64 --> 02:12:36.64
Okay, okay

2186
02:12:36.64 --> 02:12:43.64
It was it was the best care to the capability and the knowledge and understanding that they had

2187
02:12:43.64 --> 02:12:47.64
Not only of their job but of the people that they were working with

2188
02:12:47.64 --> 02:12:52.64
Yeah, in other words you got if you got a 72 year old diabetic that has an amplitude

2189
02:12:52.64 --> 02:12:58.64
The 4 pound weight is good and that you can try and transfer that over to Joe

2190
02:12:58.64 --> 02:13:02.64
Dmitik who just got off the battlefield three weeks ago

2191
02:13:02.64 --> 02:13:05.64
Yeah, he's a different animal

2192
02:13:05.64 --> 02:13:12.64
Yeah, because you're an exception too right to like what they what they're trained and what they're really good at caring for

2193
02:13:12.64 --> 02:13:16.64
You come in and this is like this isn't really typical that we all have to deal with

2194
02:13:16.64 --> 02:13:18.64
Yeah, why are we gonna change our whole system?

2195
02:13:18.64 --> 02:13:25.64
Yeah, exactly but even things like I remember the first couple nurses that came into my room

2196
02:13:25.64 --> 02:13:28.64
They were like oh hey honey, what happened with car accident?

2197
02:13:28.64 --> 02:13:33.64
Rean a motorcycle you're on a motor really well losing your foot is very typical of motorcycle accident

2198
02:13:33.64 --> 02:13:41.64
But they didn't I'm like oh I stepped on a landmine and Afghanistan we even have soldiers in Afghanistan

2199
02:13:41.64 --> 02:13:47.64
Yeah, and I was like oh so hence hence this part of the book

2200
02:13:47.64 --> 02:13:54.64
Ironically one of the biggest emotional problems I had to deal with was the anger I felt towards a medical system

2201
02:13:54.64 --> 02:13:57.64
That did not seem to be able to respond appropriately to my needs

2202
02:14:00.64 --> 02:14:04.64
Now you ended up putting on weight because you couldn't exercise

2203
02:14:04.64 --> 02:14:08.64
And you do give a little shout out right here to the dairy queen

2204
02:14:08.64 --> 02:14:12.64
And you say the dairy queen is delicious when you're depressed

2205
02:14:12.64 --> 02:14:15.64
Oh, it's so good.

2206
02:14:15.64 --> 02:14:18.64
Once it hits the lips

2207
02:14:18.64 --> 02:14:22.64
The peanut butter cups and it's worldly ice cream

2208
02:14:22.64 --> 02:14:25.64
I might have to get one right after this jacco

2209
02:14:25.64 --> 02:14:28.64
We might have to find a dairy queen up in here

2210
02:14:28.64 --> 02:14:32.64
So in conjunction with the therapy sessions

2211
02:14:32.64 --> 02:14:38.64
I also started taking an anti-depressant to start to help control my moods

2212
02:14:38.64 --> 02:14:47.64
And then there was the other kind of pain the physical kind I was still using pain killers to dull the pain that was there each and every day

2213
02:14:47.64 --> 02:14:53.64
I needed that relief so badly but in the end that too caused me tremendous suffering

2214
02:14:53.64 --> 02:14:59.64
And I turned into something I never thought I would be an addict

2215
02:14:59.64 --> 02:15:12.64
We've definitely our scene this happened with our wounded veterans

2216
02:15:12.64 --> 02:15:22.64
And here you go. In no time I was taking more of the drug that I was supposed to in order to relieve my psychological and physical pain

2217
02:15:22.64 --> 02:15:29.64
The addiction worsened and I started crushing the pills into a powder and snorting it to get a better high

2218
02:15:29.64 --> 02:15:36.64
Those pills gave me relief from my stress and mental pain if only for a little while

2219
02:15:36.64 --> 02:15:42.64
But as soon as they wore off, my demons would return

2220
02:15:42.64 --> 02:15:47.64
I worried about my future

2221
02:15:47.64 --> 02:15:54.64
If I wasn't a soldier who was I

2222
02:15:57.64 --> 02:16:06.64
And you've already said that a bunch of times that feeling of I mean everything you'd been in your life

2223
02:16:06.64 --> 02:16:12.64
From when you were a kid that was what was inside of you and then you were able to act on that

2224
02:16:12.64 --> 02:16:19.64
And become that soldier serving combat get after it on the battlefield

2225
02:16:19.64 --> 02:16:23.64
My whole adult life I became a man in the military

2226
02:16:23.64 --> 02:16:31.64
I joined as a 17 year old, 174 pound, 6 foot, 4 skinny weakling

2227
02:16:31.64 --> 02:16:39.64
I grew into the man that you see and that question when I was reading that

2228
02:16:39.64 --> 02:16:43.64
When I had a buddy that retired the other day

2229
02:16:43.64 --> 02:16:46.64
You know, 25 years

2230
02:16:46.64 --> 02:16:50.64
And I just said to him I said, now was it clean now your locker

2231
02:16:50.64 --> 02:16:53.64
Because I don't know what it's like for you guys but in the sealed teams you have a locker

2232
02:16:53.64 --> 02:16:57.64
And that's your whole career is physically represented

2233
02:16:57.64 --> 02:17:01.64
And the lockers are big. They're walking lockers. They're awesome

2234
02:17:01.64 --> 02:17:04.64
Oh wow, each guy has a walking locker

2235
02:17:04.64 --> 02:17:09.64
And there's a big drawing we call them a drying cage or calm cages because it's just made with a chain link

2236
02:17:09.64 --> 02:17:14.64
Basically, but each guy has their own, their own, their own, this is big is this office

2237
02:17:14.64 --> 02:17:18.64
You've got cruise boxes in there and it's your whole career is physically represented

2238
02:17:18.64 --> 02:17:22.64
Of everything you've ever been issued anything that you picked up along the way

2239
02:17:22.64 --> 02:17:25.64
Trinkets, everything is in your drying cage

2240
02:17:25.64 --> 02:17:27.64
And when you retire

2241
02:17:27.64 --> 02:17:33.64
You go, you clean out your cage, it's empty, you sweep out the floor, you glowed into your van

2242
02:17:33.64 --> 02:17:35.64
You drive home and that's it, it's over

2243
02:17:35.64 --> 02:17:39.64
And so I said to my buddy there, I said, you know, how was it?

2244
02:17:39.64 --> 02:17:41.64
How was it clean out your drying cage?

2245
02:17:41.64 --> 02:17:44.64
Because for me, I wasn't even worried about retiring

2246
02:17:44.64 --> 02:17:48.64
I'm like, okay, I gotta go do this, I gotta do this, I'm all good, come back

2247
02:17:48.64 --> 02:17:50.64
Clean it out my cage

2248
02:17:50.64 --> 02:17:52.64
And I'm like, oh, this is over

2249
02:17:52.64 --> 02:17:55.64
And for me, I spent 18 out of 20 years out here on the west coast

2250
02:17:55.64 --> 02:18:01.64
And all within like a stone's throw of the different buildings

2251
02:18:01.64 --> 02:18:05.64
I mean, all within these certain number of buildings

2252
02:18:05.64 --> 02:18:07.64
Since I was a kid

2253
02:18:07.64 --> 02:18:12.64
And the question, so when I was reading that you wrote this

2254
02:18:12.64 --> 02:18:13.64
That's what I was thinking about

2255
02:18:13.64 --> 02:18:15.64
What my buddy was thinking

2256
02:18:15.64 --> 02:18:21.64
If I'm not a soldier, if I'm not a seal, then what am I?

2257
02:18:21.64 --> 02:18:25.64
And that's a tough question to answer

2258
02:18:25.64 --> 02:18:27.64
For a lot of guys

2259
02:18:27.64 --> 02:18:31.64
It's brutal and it comes back to what we were talking about before

2260
02:18:31.64 --> 02:18:32.64
Dwelling

2261
02:18:32.64 --> 02:18:34.64
Right

2262
02:18:34.64 --> 02:18:43.64
I, it was really hard for me because I didn't choose to leave

2263
02:18:43.64 --> 02:18:46.64
I'd always imagine I'd be abounded

2264
02:18:46.64 --> 02:18:51.64
I don't know why, like, you know, visualization is very important

2265
02:18:51.64 --> 02:18:53.64
In my opinion, in our line of work

2266
02:18:53.64 --> 02:19:00.64
And so I'd always try to envision a good being wound, okay, but it was like the cool scar across the cheek

2267
02:19:00.64 --> 02:19:02.64
Or like some shrapnel in the rib cage

2268
02:19:02.64 --> 02:19:05.64
I could show off a barbecue, you know, and talk about when I'm like 80

2269
02:19:05.64 --> 02:19:07.64
Yeah, so I've got some Taliban and menl in there

2270
02:19:07.64 --> 02:19:11.64
But, you know, like, it's that or it's a body bag

2271
02:19:11.64 --> 02:19:13.64
You don't think about the in-between

2272
02:19:13.64 --> 02:19:16.64
Even our system, right, our medical system and Canada

2273
02:19:16.64 --> 02:19:19.64
Lots of body bags, lots of bandages

2274
02:19:19.64 --> 02:19:24.64
But, the in-between part, they kind of dropped the ball

2275
02:19:24.64 --> 02:19:26.64
Yeah, and years ago

2276
02:19:26.64 --> 02:19:30.64
World War I probably World War II, you wouldn't have made it

2277
02:19:30.64 --> 02:19:32.64
They wouldn't have to deal with you

2278
02:19:32.64 --> 02:19:34.64
No, because you would have blood out

2279
02:19:34.64 --> 02:19:37.64
They didn't know teach RippleC, they wouldn't have gotten your calves back

2280
02:19:37.64 --> 02:19:40.64
I mean, it would have been you would have died, that's all the rest of it

2281
02:19:40.64 --> 02:19:42.64
Yeah, double amputation, yeah, forget about it

2282
02:19:42.64 --> 02:19:45.64
So they just didn't have that back then

2283
02:19:45.64 --> 02:19:47.64
Vietnam got a lot better

2284
02:19:47.64 --> 02:19:50.64
In terms of the Casivac situation, they could have a lot faster

2285
02:19:50.64 --> 02:19:52.64
That's why you don't have a lot more of it

2286
02:19:52.64 --> 02:19:55.64
But, figure out what you're going to do next

2287
02:19:55.64 --> 02:20:00.64
And you held onto it, you held onto it, you tried to hang onto it

2288
02:20:00.64 --> 02:20:02.64
Because you decided you know what, I'm going to still be a soldier

2289
02:20:02.64 --> 02:20:05.64
Yeah, you got done with it, you did a half marathon

2290
02:20:05.64 --> 02:20:09.64
But after that half marathon, you were just to beat up

2291
02:20:09.64 --> 02:20:15.64
Yeah, from that, and you decided that

2292
02:20:15.64 --> 02:20:18.64
Well, here's what you put in the book, I tell people

2293
02:20:18.64 --> 02:20:22.64
That Jodie the soldier was wounded in January of 2007

2294
02:20:22.64 --> 02:20:24.64
But it took him about two years to die

2295
02:20:24.64 --> 02:20:28.64
To let the soldier in you go

2296
02:20:28.64 --> 02:20:33.64
And I'm going to continue

2297
02:20:33.64 --> 02:20:36.64
Of course, this wasn't an easy decision for me

2298
02:20:36.64 --> 02:20:38.64
And I was filled with rage and anger

2299
02:20:38.64 --> 02:20:41.64
And again, I started using oxy-coctin

2300
02:20:41.64 --> 02:20:45.64
As a relief from the pain of loss

2301
02:20:45.64 --> 02:20:47.64
It became my problem yet again

2302
02:20:47.64 --> 02:20:52.64
But I diluted myself into believing I had it under my control

2303
02:20:52.64 --> 02:21:03.64
You talk about this thing where you're reading a reader's digest article

2304
02:21:03.64 --> 02:21:06.64
Yeah, and there's an oxy-coctin addict in there

2305
02:21:06.64 --> 02:21:09.64
Yeah, and he's talking about how he's shooting it up

2306
02:21:09.64 --> 02:21:13.64
And you said to yourself, you weren't thinking, oh, that's horrible

2307
02:21:13.64 --> 02:21:17.64
I can't believe you're like, I didn't know you could answer that

2308
02:21:17.64 --> 02:21:20.64
And that is what hits you

2309
02:21:20.64 --> 02:21:25.64
Yeah, and I think that is what hits you

2310
02:21:25.64 --> 02:21:28.64
Realizing that's when you realize you weren't in control

2311
02:21:28.64 --> 02:21:30.64
I mean, that's got to be that moment

2312
02:21:30.64 --> 02:21:36.64
Because the story was he was a doctor, I believe, injecting himself

2313
02:21:36.64 --> 02:21:39.64
In the bathroom and his young daughter walked in

2314
02:21:39.64 --> 02:21:41.64
And I had now had a young daughter

2315
02:21:41.64 --> 02:21:45.64
And I could just, I now am like, and in my mind, it wasn't

2316
02:21:45.64 --> 02:21:50.64
Oh, imagine if my daughter caught me going to inject, I went, oh, I can inject

2317
02:21:50.64 --> 02:21:54.64
And I even went through a second way

2318
02:21:54.64 --> 02:21:58.64
I remember how great it was to get the intervenes drugs in the hospital

2319
02:21:58.64 --> 02:22:03.64
And then the next second was, oh, this is not good

2320
02:22:03.64 --> 02:22:05.64
This is not good

2321
02:22:05.64 --> 02:22:10.64
And then when I ended up buying, I ended up buying per cassette, which is like

2322
02:22:10.64 --> 02:22:15.64
Goxie cotton, but like, from a guy that I knew through another guy

2323
02:22:15.64 --> 02:22:17.64
And it was they were in Ziplock bags

2324
02:22:17.64 --> 02:22:19.64
Basically a drug deal

2325
02:22:19.64 --> 02:22:23.64
Remember that thing they got me arrested 20 years ago

2326
02:22:23.64 --> 02:22:28.64
And I went, okay, this is it, this ends here

2327
02:22:28.64 --> 02:22:32.64
Well, that's an awesome, I mean, that's awesome credit to you all that

2328
02:22:32.64 --> 02:22:37.64
Because so many people, unfortunately they don't take ownership of that

2329
02:22:37.64 --> 02:22:40.64
They don't say to themselves, you know what?

2330
02:22:40.64 --> 02:22:43.64
I am addicted and this thing is controlling me

2331
02:22:43.64 --> 02:22:47.64
And they always say things like just what you said, oh, I got this under control

2332
02:22:47.64 --> 02:22:50.64
I can stop if I want to, I just don't want to

2333
02:22:50.64 --> 02:22:52.64
I need it, I'm in pain

2334
02:22:52.64 --> 02:22:53.64
There he go

2335
02:22:53.64 --> 02:22:55.64
I had to take it

2336
02:22:55.64 --> 02:22:55.64
Yeah

2337
02:22:55.64 --> 02:22:58.64
And I would ask the doctors, I would say, how do we get, how do we get me off this?

2338
02:22:58.64 --> 02:23:01.64
And this was still, you know, oh seven, oh eight

2339
02:23:01.64 --> 02:23:05.64
Nine, I think it was 2011 before I finished

2340
02:23:05.64 --> 02:23:07.64
Or got off them

2341
02:23:07.64 --> 02:23:13.64
They still had, and candidly, anyway, hadn't realized what oxy cotton was capable of

2342
02:23:13.64 --> 02:23:17.64
And so the dogs, it's like three days of withdrawals

2343
02:23:17.64 --> 02:23:19.64
It's fine, don't worry about it

2344
02:23:19.64 --> 02:23:23.64
Those withdrawals were worse than being wounded

2345
02:23:23.64 --> 02:23:27.64
Those three days, here's your quote

2346
02:23:27.64 --> 02:23:31.64
Those three days were absolute horror

2347
02:23:31.64 --> 02:23:35.64
Quitting oxy cotton was harder and more painful

2348
02:23:35.64 --> 02:23:38.64
Then getting blown up in Afghanistan

2349
02:23:38.64 --> 02:23:39.64
Yeah

2350
02:23:41.64 --> 02:23:45.64
Because, because it was three days

2351
02:23:45.64 --> 02:23:48.64
Whereas I was in the worst

2352
02:23:48.64 --> 02:23:52.64
Jocco echo, I cannot tell you what the pain was like

2353
02:23:52.64 --> 02:23:53.64
Because it was so bad

2354
02:23:53.64 --> 02:23:56.64
And that was the pain from going from withdrawals

2355
02:23:56.64 --> 02:23:57.64
No, the pain from getting blown up

2356
02:23:57.64 --> 02:23:58.64
Okay, so the pain from getting blown up

2357
02:23:58.64 --> 02:24:00.64
I cannot describe it to you

2358
02:24:00.64 --> 02:24:05.64
But the withdrawals lasted three days of that kind of pain

2359
02:24:05.64 --> 02:24:08.64
Because your body and your mind are trying to trick you

2360
02:24:08.64 --> 02:24:12.64
You're still in pain, man, you're still in pain, you should take him, you should take him

2361
02:24:12.64 --> 02:24:14.64
But once, you know what's funny?

2362
02:24:14.64 --> 02:24:18.64
Though the three days, it's almost like you hit a switch

2363
02:24:18.64 --> 02:24:21.64
And suddenly the pain starts to dissipate

2364
02:24:21.64 --> 02:24:24.64
The hollow feeling in your chest

2365
02:24:24.64 --> 02:24:27.64
And just to fill back in

2366
02:24:27.64 --> 02:24:30.64
The that stop crawling on your skin

2367
02:24:30.64 --> 02:24:32.64
Because that's ergoing through all that

2368
02:24:32.64 --> 02:24:35.64
I was grinding the stumps of my legs into the coach

2369
02:24:35.64 --> 02:24:38.64
To give it some kind of other sensation

2370
02:24:38.64 --> 02:24:41.64
Other than I described it as like

2371
02:24:41.64 --> 02:24:43.64
It was like a dog, you ever watch a dog chew on a bone

2372
02:24:43.64 --> 02:24:46.64
When he's going to between his paws and he's just going to town

2373
02:24:46.64 --> 02:24:48.64
Like with his teeth, that's what it felt like

2374
02:24:48.64 --> 02:24:49.64
On the ends of my legs

2375
02:24:49.64 --> 02:24:57.68
my legs was like I had like an animal just knowing on my legs. And then one day of you know

2376
02:24:57.68 --> 02:25:01.72
wherever the third or second and two and a half for three days later I realized I'm like

2377
02:25:01.72 --> 02:25:10.44
oh most of that's kind of pretty much gone. It's crazy. And I tell you there's Jodi before

2378
02:25:10.44 --> 02:25:16.000
he quit ox cotton and then there's Jodi a Jodi before he quit was still trying his best

2379
02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:21.92
and doing well and if you talked to anybody was the guy a lot of people looked up to but

2380
02:25:21.92 --> 02:25:26.08
things really started to turn around after I quit. You know I really started to become

2381
02:25:26.08 --> 02:25:33.60
capable of a lot in my mind I think there's a big difference. But man that shit just my

2382
02:25:33.60 --> 02:25:39.68
buddy he's a he's a parrot trooper and he had to get some surgery on his knee. You know

2383
02:25:39.68 --> 02:25:44.40
parrot troopers are always banging up their knees and the dogger gave him a coating or

2384
02:25:44.40 --> 02:25:48.40
a ton of three or something like that and he literally took it and threw it in the garbage.

2385
02:25:48.40 --> 02:25:53.04
He's like I saw it out in a jodi. I just like I don't even I don't want anything.

2386
02:25:53.04 --> 02:26:00.88
And that's my advice kids out there do not take it if you don't if you can greet your

2387
02:26:00.88 --> 02:26:08.48
teeth enough do not take that shit. Stay clean. Do your best. I wouldn't trust me around it now.

2388
02:26:08.48 --> 02:26:16.24
If you had one I might take it. I don't it's good. Let's just take some more of this

2389
02:26:16.24 --> 02:26:21.68
alphabet brain. Take the alphabet brain. I'll get on it instead of getting addicted again.

2390
02:26:21.68 --> 02:26:32.48
Get off it by getting on it. So now you get through it you're not addicted to

2391
02:26:32.48 --> 02:26:39.92
oxycod anymore and now it's what do my gonna do with my life. Yeah and here you go. What did I

2392
02:26:39.92 --> 02:26:45.04
actually want and what was possible and could I really put my military pass behind me and

2393
02:26:45.04 --> 02:26:50.48
pursue something else that would make me feel fulfilled but it was time to stop asking questions.

2394
02:26:50.48 --> 02:26:52.64
It was time to find some answers.

2395
02:26:52.64 --> 02:27:09.44
And here you're kind of referring back and it's the last chapter. It's called on my own two feet.

2396
02:27:11.04 --> 02:27:14.80
I would actually still get a sense of humor after all this. Can't make fun of yourself man.

2397
02:27:15.84 --> 02:27:20.16
Taking life way to series. So a lot of professional athletes will tell you they missed

2398
02:27:20.16 --> 02:27:24.80
two things when they retire the competition on the field and the camaraderie with the team late

2399
02:27:24.80 --> 02:27:29.44
teammates in the locker room. It's the exact same thing for soldiers after we leave the armed forces.

2400
02:27:30.56 --> 02:27:36.24
When I see soldiers on parade I still get chills down my spine because I loved it so much.

2401
02:27:40.72 --> 02:27:44.56
Just letting everybody know that that's completely normal. For all you guys that got out for

2402
02:27:44.56 --> 02:27:50.48
whatever reason totally normal. Jody feels it. I feel it. We all feel that.

2403
02:27:52.80 --> 02:28:00.16
So then you went and did the amazing race in Canada. Yeah we had the you got second place with your brother.

2404
02:28:00.16 --> 02:28:05.36
Second place and it was the first season because the American amazing race was the most popular

2405
02:28:05.36 --> 02:28:10.88
show in Canada. So let's make a Canadian. Let's make a Canadian one. If Canadians love anything

2406
02:28:10.88 --> 02:28:17.36
more than the American version it's the Canadian version. Then you ended up doing this city councilor thing.

2407
02:28:17.36 --> 02:28:25.60
Yeah. And that's where you're at now. That's where I'm at now.

2408
02:28:26.88 --> 02:28:31.44
You know one part that we haven't talked about and I'm gonna do it a little bit of

2409
02:28:31.44 --> 02:28:39.12
uh I'm gonna score a few brownie points here at home. So I said they had to plow a road to me. Yeah.

2410
02:28:39.12 --> 02:28:45.60
To rescue me right. They literally plowed a road with a combat bulldozer and right behind it was what

2411
02:28:45.60 --> 02:28:53.92
we call a buys and ambulance and it's an eight-wheeled almost built in the same factory as the LAV in Ontario.

2412
02:28:53.92 --> 02:29:04.08
And London Ontario Canada by unionized workers and and the commander of that vehicle was

2413
02:29:04.08 --> 02:29:11.76
master corpola lana Gilmore of the Canadian forces medical corps who is now my wife retired

2414
02:29:11.76 --> 02:29:19.04
surgeon a lana Gilmore of the Canadian forces medical corps and we have two beautiful daughters

2415
02:29:19.04 --> 02:29:34.000
Aela seven and cure a four and we we we managed to connect I was wounded in January we connected

2416
02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:41.04
in September or Octoberish of the same of 2007 my girlfriend that I had had when I got wounded had

2417
02:29:41.04 --> 02:29:49.76
left no fault of hers I don't blame her one one bit you know to get thrown into a situation where

2418
02:29:49.76 --> 02:29:57.84
you have to care for a wounded soldier a guy who before was like a rock you know and that's not what

2419
02:29:57.84 --> 02:30:04.56
she signed up for right and and and a lana had recently broken up with with with her partner as well

2420
02:30:04.56 --> 02:30:09.92
and when we found each other though the fact that she was a hot Irish blonde was just really

2421
02:30:09.92 --> 02:30:17.60
a bonus got to be honest and and she took one you know jocco I call medics they're like

2422
02:30:17.60 --> 02:30:24.56
our momies what do you guys have corps men you call them because combat guys were little

2423
02:30:24.56 --> 02:30:28.08
loads that saying if you're gonna be tough you if you're gonna be dumb you got to be tough

2424
02:30:28.08 --> 02:30:31.76
you're gonna be stupid you got to be tough yeah and that's and that's us we need the corpsmen

2425
02:30:31.76 --> 02:30:36.32
or the medic to be like hey hey hey jocco why are you limping what come here come here

2426
02:30:36.32 --> 02:30:41.52
come here come here no no no not in front of the other troops mom stop it stop it and and so that's

2427
02:30:41.52 --> 02:30:47.76
their job so she saw me she took one look at me she's like you look terrible I was surviving on

2428
02:30:47.76 --> 02:30:54.96
vector cereal and drive through sandwiches because I was by myself all the boys were still deployed

2429
02:30:54.96 --> 02:31:02.48
or on course and I was living in my own private house on base so I'd moved on to base I had this

2430
02:31:02.48 --> 02:31:07.52
little puppy Charlie who wasn't he's not a service dog by any stretch but he's the only

2431
02:31:07.52 --> 02:31:11.52
reason I got it a bed in the morning so I owe him he's still my buddy still at that he's at the

2432
02:31:11.52 --> 02:31:19.36
house right now and so she went into medic mode really she went you know what you should come

2433
02:31:19.36 --> 02:31:24.48
by my house bring your dog you can play with my dog and you know let's just hang out and when we got

2434
02:31:25.52 --> 02:31:30.16
when we saw each other though it was camaraderie she was one of the last people to see me on the

2435
02:31:30.16 --> 02:31:38.48
battlefield she carried my stretcher to the to the to the evac chopper and you know if you talk to her

2436
02:31:38.48 --> 02:31:47.20
the fact that I was you know a bearded hot guy was just a bonus to her too and you know

2437
02:31:47.92 --> 02:31:56.24
eventually I let her kiss me guys okay passively I'm sure yeah now she likes she she's going to

2438
02:31:56.24 --> 02:32:04.40
ask me did you tell jockel the same joke you tell everyone else that I kissed you but when we we got

2439
02:32:04.40 --> 02:32:14.96
pregnant a little quick a Elizabeth A September do the math so but you know we realized

2440
02:32:16.72 --> 02:32:20.40
we talked about it when we talked about the survivors guilt you don't you didn't survive

2441
02:32:20.40 --> 02:32:28.16
you know your friends live for your friends I didn't survive and she didn't like her vehicle hit

2442
02:32:28.16 --> 02:32:34.64
landmines and she was ambushes and all you know near near death on a battlefield is a bullet

2443
02:32:34.64 --> 02:32:40.000
going in from your head that's near death yeah you laugh about it after but that's so she was in

2444
02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:47.68
all that too and so she's pregnant and and I should have died and who knows what could have happened

2445
02:32:47.68 --> 02:32:53.68
to her and who were we to deny what's happening you know so I I have I had to throw that out there

2446
02:32:53.68 --> 02:33:00.56
that you know I have three beautiful blondes in my life with blue eyed blondes that you know

2447
02:33:00.56 --> 02:33:08.40
keep me in check and because I the the feelings I had in the book they're not all in the past

2448
02:33:09.44 --> 02:33:15.92
you know I woke up yesterday when I missed the flight man it it was more

2449
02:33:15.92 --> 02:33:23.76
that I was disappointing you right and hear me out right because I was just like I was like

2450
02:33:25.28 --> 02:33:29.60
I'm the city counselor and a lot of guys look up to me and this and that and all you know

2451
02:33:29.60 --> 02:33:35.36
like got these kids and you know Lanna and I and I still can't make a fucking flight you know

2452
02:33:35.36 --> 02:33:39.12
and I haven't even met the guy yet and I'm already disappointing him and that went through me

2453
02:33:39.68 --> 02:33:44.08
and it's all because I stepped on that stupid landline but I wouldn't even be here if I had

2454
02:33:44.08 --> 02:33:48.08
stepped on that landline I wouldn't have had these I wouldn't have these kids if I hadn't

2455
02:33:48.08 --> 02:33:53.44
stepped on that landline after my second fiance walked out of the house and my you know like

2456
02:33:53.44 --> 02:33:57.68
all I said that's my joke I like all good soldiers I have three ex fiancees and it does an

2457
02:33:57.68 --> 02:34:01.76
ex girlfriend's sacrifice to the queen because we still swear allegiance to the queen

2458
02:34:02.88 --> 02:34:09.60
because it's real that's like you said the teams come first and I had said well I'm going to retire

2459
02:34:09.60 --> 02:34:16.32
about 44 with 25 years in so why don't I just start kids and I'll add that and I'm sure my life

2460
02:34:16.32 --> 02:34:24.16
would be fine if I hadn't stepped on the landline but would it be as fulfilling would I be as as as

2461
02:34:24.16 --> 02:34:33.68
as broad or would I be as complete I'm sure I'd be a kickass speck-op sniper somewhere doing

2462
02:34:33.68 --> 02:34:43.20
something but I couldn't have met like if if I had a wish to not step on the mine but I wouldn't

2463
02:34:43.20 --> 02:34:50.64
get to keep the kids I'd step on that mine 10 times at a ten and so I had to you know I'd throw

2464
02:34:50.64 --> 02:34:58.16
it in there and give credit to Lana for what she did for me and also my friends and family right

2465
02:34:58.16 --> 02:35:05.84
this nobody does it no one's a rock you know so I just had to say all that yeah no and I actually

2466
02:35:06.48 --> 02:35:10.80
I have a question about your wife okay I was going to keep you an opportunity to steal some of your

2467
02:35:10.80 --> 02:35:16.48
thunder not at all not at all I'm glad you I'm glad you put that out there and also I didn't want

2468
02:35:16.48 --> 02:35:21.28
to steal thunder from your book right and it was one of the things that I was going to tell people I mean

2469
02:35:21.28 --> 02:35:27.20
obviously I think people who's going to buy this I mean obviously I there's this is the a big book

2470
02:35:27.20 --> 02:35:33.12
which I've taken some excerpts out of yeah and there's so much more in it when you read it

2471
02:35:33.12 --> 02:35:38.32
and you get the whole the whole package one of which is you explaining these relationships

2472
02:35:38.96 --> 02:35:48.16
with your wife with your kids how that happened which is just I mean for all practical purposes

2473
02:35:48.16 --> 02:35:55.36
let's just call it what it is that's a miracle yeah

2474
02:35:55.36 --> 02:36:04.80
here's how it closes out people often ask me if I regret my time in afghanistan because it

2475
02:36:04.80 --> 02:36:13.60
cost me my two feet and completely changed my life if you live your life with regrets then you

2476
02:36:13.60 --> 02:36:19.52
never move forward those six months in afghanistan before the explosion were some of the best

2477
02:36:19.52 --> 02:36:27.20
times of my life I can honestly say as I look back on my life in the military I wouldn't

2478
02:36:27.20 --> 02:36:32.88
have changed a thing if I hadn't stepped on that landmine I would never have connected with a

2479
02:36:32.88 --> 02:36:39.92
Lana I would never have had two beautiful daughters my mind and body were pushed to the limit

2480
02:36:40.56 --> 02:36:46.72
after my accident and ironically I came out on the other side a better more complete person

2481
02:36:46.72 --> 02:36:55.76
maybe life would be easier now if I hadn't lost a part of both legs but it certainly wouldn't have

2482
02:36:55.76 --> 02:37:02.88
been any more complete when I when I am in public today advocating for veterans rights or simply

2483
02:37:02.88 --> 02:37:08.40
going about my daily life people sometimes approach me to say thank you for your service

2484
02:37:08.40 --> 02:37:16.000
those five words mean more to me than anything else

2485
02:37:24.08 --> 02:37:27.92
and now I'd like to say something jodie from me

2505
02:40:01.96 --> 02:40:06.52

02:40:11.32 --> 02:40:18.04
a third out for some of the send it pick yeah and then someone found a legit weighted network or some
