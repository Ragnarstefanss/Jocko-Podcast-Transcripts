Sometimes, you know, well, actually all the time, if you, if you really want to feel like working out, you know, like, I feel like working out right now. And I've said this since day one, that's one of the things I talked about on the spot gas is, you know, I don't feel like I'm really good at helping, you know, people with causes and stuff like that. This is still going to be you, but, you know, this is going to sound real obvious and cliche, but the whole compromise thing, you know, when you guys have a punchy kids, you got to compromise that. You know, they learn how are they going to get through this, how are they going to adapt their life, how are they going to roll with one leg, how are they going to do pull ups with one hand. and I got real good at, you know, like the exercise, like gymnast can do it like on a palm or something. This much, you know, is different and A that goes along with what I said like communicating actively, you know, not like telling me that. You know, like, let's say every Tuesday you went to talk to us day or something like that and drank every Tuesday right before kids. And to prepare for them, you know, you got to, you got to, my favorite thing to do prepares, you know, you get to go. If you're going to do hard stuff that's like extended in a hard like you're just your crossfit situation or that kind of stuff. Yeah, that's a good way to, to put it, like, take advantage of it, like actively, because a lot of times like, where the problem comes about. But your wife is like, how can you reconcile going to train with your buddies, you know, because a lot of times the girlfriend and the wife will think that that's just some fun in games. I, you got all the time that gym I'm doing, you know, six rounds, seven rounds, you know, nine rounds, whatever the case may be. So again, you know, if you're getting wrapped up in some small nuanced thing, it it, it mentions the political, like if you're not politically congruent with, I don't know if you meant that split. And you asked, you know, like I said, you've got to ask those questions all the way up. You find out what it feels like when someone's going psycho on you because they're going to be going psycho. You know, because there were some people that even about the, even about the forgotten Highlander, there were some people that said, hey, you know, that's just too much. You know, you're not going to be just chilling in some guys guard or, you know, because because it's, you can possible chill in the garden. And now part of that, I got to, you know, in full disclosure, I was deployed a fair amount, but when you got those young kids, here's what you got to do. Like a lot of people, you know how people, some people really into supplements. And I mean, I was at a high level, you know, I mean, I was, I was, you know, a brown belt or a black belt at the time. Just like, you know, you put human beings living in the same village, you know, you end up marrying somebody from the other tribe. You know, you don't know what's going to happen when you go into the field. In fact, that's actually a good strategy in some cases, you know, when you got to recover or something like this. And I like I said I don't just want every time that you turn on this podcast to get crushed with something like this. I mean, obviously right now, we've got, you know, we got ISIS that are doing the same activities. And if you, but you know, still you're still going to have more time in your day, right? Yeah, it's not going to be as luxurious as, you know, you're not going to be optimum. It's almost like you have this hope, like, oh, it'll be soon or maybe the doctor said nine months, but maybe I could do it in four kind of thing.
