00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000 This is Jockel podcast number 330 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
00:00:08.68 --> 00:00:11.68 A little after midnight on Thanksgiving
00:00:12.48 --> 00:00:17.72 1943 while patrolling the black waters off Cape St. George near New Guinea
00:00:18.36 --> 00:00:20.88 Berks five ship Wolfpack
00:00:21.68 --> 00:00:23.68 spotted a Japanese radar contact
00:00:24.92 --> 00:00:27.32 immediately and without permission
00:00:27.32 --> 00:00:30.52 Burke radioed his squadron
00:00:30.52 --> 00:00:33.52 hold your hats boys here we go
00:00:35.52 --> 00:00:37.52 into the dark and into the enemies guns
00:00:37.52 --> 00:00:41.96 Berks destroyers drop throttles to flank speed and launch torpedoes
00:00:41.96 --> 00:00:44.52 exploding two Japanese ships outright
00:00:44.52 --> 00:00:46.52 then wheeled to star bird
00:00:46.52 --> 00:00:50.12 like the Parthine courses archers
00:00:50.12 --> 00:00:53.32 into the face of three more enemy ships
00:00:53.32 --> 00:00:58.60 that immediately tucked tail and fled in the night long pursuit
00:00:58.60 --> 00:01:01.80 Berks dex sailors discharge and loaded their guns so fast
00:01:01.80 --> 00:01:06.36 and so long that many passed out in their turrets from the fumes
00:01:06.36 --> 00:01:08.36 and from sheer exhaustion
00:01:09.64 --> 00:01:12.92 when Berks squadron finally returned to port
00:01:13.56 --> 00:01:19.48 set a time magazine reporter every ship in the road stead turned up its search lights
00:01:19.48 --> 00:01:23.48 and every blue jacket in the fleet man the rails in tribute
00:01:25.16 --> 00:01:28.84 it was Halsey said afterward the classic
00:01:28.84 --> 00:01:30.52 c-action of this war
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.60 for 13 months
00:01:34.60 --> 00:01:37.88 Burke commanded his destroyers like patented his tanks
00:01:38.92 --> 00:01:42.28 to every order he invariably responded
00:01:42.28 --> 00:01:44.04 preceding at 31 knots
00:01:45.08 --> 00:01:48.60 a boiler bursting pace said one historian
00:01:48.60 --> 00:01:51.16 that caught admiral William Bowel Hallsey's attention
00:01:51.16 --> 00:01:56.76 who addressed the few his future dispatches to 31 knot Burke
00:01:57.80 --> 00:01:59.80 the name stuck
00:02:01.24 --> 00:02:05.40 in the last two years the war Burke was forced to give up command of his own squadron
00:02:05.40 --> 00:02:07.24 in order to become chief of staff
00:02:07.24 --> 00:02:10.76 to mark missioner famous aircraft carrier admiral
00:02:10.76 --> 00:02:14.36 neither a pilot nor possessing any experience in aircraft carriers
00:02:14.36 --> 00:02:17.08 Burke was at first out of place in the new staff role
00:02:17.08 --> 00:02:20.44 an onlooker to the aviators and a jolt to his morale
00:02:20.44 --> 00:02:22.92 that almost immediately expanded to his waistline
00:02:24.76 --> 00:02:28.68 essentially confined to the flag plot the ship's tactical command center
00:02:28.68 --> 00:02:32.12 Burke was forced not only to learn everything he could about aircraft carriers
00:02:32.12 --> 00:02:35.64 and their tactics but also to elevate his operational understanding
00:02:36.44 --> 00:02:41.000 beyond the amateur's urge for the battle at hand in order to plan for the next one
00:02:42.04 --> 00:02:44.60 beyond the Marianas to the Philippine sea
00:02:44.60 --> 00:02:48.36 beyond that to late-a-golf then onto Ewo Jima
00:02:49.96 --> 00:02:53.08 when submarine intelligence told him the battleship
00:02:53.08 --> 00:02:57.72 Yamoto was spotted and route to an unknown location
00:02:57.72 --> 00:03:00.84 he spent all night hunched over his charge
00:03:00.84 --> 00:03:06.28 charts a caliper in hand then launched 400 planes against the spot
00:03:06.28 --> 00:03:09.000 where he would be if the rules were reversed
00:03:10.44 --> 00:03:13.48 and sank the ship with more than 3000 men aboard
00:03:13.48 --> 00:03:18.44 before his planes returned to Burke had already switched his attention to the next battle
00:03:18.44 --> 00:03:24.76 by the time they reached Ocanawa the final terrible fight of the World War of World War II
00:03:24.76 --> 00:03:27.32 Burke had settled into a punishing routine
00:03:27.32 --> 00:03:33.48 always up at 0 330 the sleep he did manage was usually interrupted by some 20 calls a night
00:03:33.48 --> 00:03:39.24 in his waking hours Burke watched nightmares unfold his only sanctuary the flashes of
00:03:39.24 --> 00:03:43.96 courage that for years to come set a biographer would seem to whisper to him
00:03:43.96 --> 00:03:47.32 something about the meaning of the US Navy
00:03:48.20 --> 00:03:54.76 the worst of these and the greatest was the final transmission of a newly commissioned
00:03:54.76 --> 00:04:00.12 ensin who had taken command of his crippled destroyer after everyone else in his chain of command
00:04:00.12 --> 00:04:01.32 had been killed
00:04:03.16 --> 00:04:06.76 before the ship sank and the transmission was caught off
00:04:06.76 --> 00:04:10.44 Burke heard the young man say quote
00:04:10.44 --> 00:04:15.64 I will fight this ship to the best of my ability and forgive me the mistakes I am about to make
00:04:15.64 --> 00:04:17.64 and quote
00:04:19.32 --> 00:04:24.68 that voice would haunt and steal him for the rest of his life
00:04:24.68 --> 00:04:41.08 and that is an emotion and a haunting that I think many of us feel
00:04:43.48 --> 00:04:47.000 did I do enough to train the young leaders that followed me
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.44 and the answer always seems to be no I could have done more I could have passed on
00:04:54.44 --> 00:05:00.12 more lessons learned I could have done a better job teaching our operational history to the next
00:05:00.12 --> 00:05:03.32 generation so that they would not repeat the mistakes we made
00:05:07.48 --> 00:05:11.48 but there's so much to teach and there's so much to learn and there's so many lessons to pass on
00:05:11.48 --> 00:05:17.48 and sometimes lessons don't get passed on they get forgotten
00:05:20.52 --> 00:05:26.68 and only the deepest of dedication and research and commitment can bring
00:05:27.64 --> 00:05:28.92 those lessons back
00:05:31.88 --> 00:05:36.04 and that reading that I opened with was an excerpt from the book
00:05:36.04 --> 00:05:43.96 the book is called by water beneath the walls which was written by a friend of mine
00:05:44.84 --> 00:05:51.56 a seal teammate of mine by the name of Ben Milligan Ben has been on this podcast before
00:05:51.56 --> 00:05:57.96 it's podcast number 298 go listen to that if you haven't listened to it yet but on that podcast
00:05:59.08 --> 00:06:01.56 we discussed where Ben came from how he ended up in the seal teams
00:06:01.56 --> 00:06:07.88 and how we ended up writing this incredible book which took him seven years to write
00:06:09.08 --> 00:06:14.92 and the book is an amazing book I think this is the most important historical book
00:06:14.92 --> 00:06:20.92 I have ever read on the seal teams and I think it actually might be the most important book
00:06:20.92 --> 00:06:26.92 on special operations as a whole that I have read and if you haven't read this book
00:06:26.92 --> 00:06:34.52 by it immediately it is absolutely an incredible look at the history of the seal teams
00:06:34.52 --> 00:06:41.80 but it ties in so many other aspects of the military and special operations and the wars we've been through
00:06:43.16 --> 00:06:50.84 and the amount of commitment that it took to write this was one amount of commitment
00:06:50.84 --> 00:06:57.96 that can come from only someone with Ben's personality and his his drive to find out
00:06:57.96 --> 00:07:03.16 in unravel history and we're lucky enough to have Ben back with us to discuss
00:07:04.76 --> 00:07:08.92 more of these incredible accounts of histories history from the seal teams
00:07:09.56 --> 00:07:16.92 and of the entire community of special operations so Ben thanks for coming back man
00:07:16.92 --> 00:07:25.40 thanks Joko it's great to be here and thanks for that section to it's one of my favorite
00:07:25.40 --> 00:07:33.80 sections in the book one of the hardest things you do when you write a book is you have to
00:07:33.80 --> 00:07:37.24 edit it and you have to cut it and I think we talked about that last time this was one of those
00:07:37.24 --> 00:07:43.56 sections that I had probably 15 more pages just on berk that I had dropped my that chapter
00:07:43.56 --> 00:07:48.76 have been completely structured differently I had started with berk at his change of commands
00:07:48.76 --> 00:07:55.24 ceremony when he became the CNO and then I rolled into you know this you know 15 page just
00:07:56.04 --> 00:08:03.48 it was my biggest introduction of a character even bigger probably than draper off
00:08:03.48 --> 00:08:07.96 I justifi that and I have when I was writing it because I always felt like berk or at least
00:08:07.96 --> 00:08:11.40 when I discovered berk when I discovered his contribution to the creation of the seal
00:08:11.40 --> 00:08:21.24 teams I felt like next to Phil Buckleau early berk is the indispensable man he the seal
00:08:21.24 --> 00:08:27.80 teams would not have existed without him without and the it wouldn't have existed without his
00:08:27.80 --> 00:08:34.68 biography that he just consolidated into you know this complete preoccupation with keeping the
00:08:34.68 --> 00:08:41.96 navy connected to offensive warfare and and there was just example after example of his time in
00:08:41.96 --> 00:08:49.24 world war two you know there were he was in at least two two vessel pants shot out from under
00:08:49.24 --> 00:08:54.92 hammer two two vessels were sunk by the Japanese that he had to and he had to escape from and in each
00:08:54.92 --> 00:08:59.72 instance of his cape he was leaving behind every possession that he had every possession that
00:08:59.72 --> 00:09:03.72 he had gone through the war with and in the process he was rescuing guys around him
00:09:03.72 --> 00:09:14.12 and in one case wrist his life going into a completely smoke filled passageway to rescue a
00:09:15.24 --> 00:09:21.16 I think it was a semen like a radio radio man and he's the you know the chief staff of the ship
00:09:21.16 --> 00:09:25.88 and he had no business he get off the ship but he's you know saving the sailors around him
00:09:25.88 --> 00:09:42.36 but yeah he was like you like you mentioned in your you're opening the his commitment to passing
00:09:42.36 --> 00:09:49.32 on what he had learned not just what he had learned but his belief in what the navy was
00:09:49.32 --> 00:09:55.96 to that next generation that's what kept him as a seano for six years I guess say in the book it's
00:09:55.96 --> 00:10:01.72 two years longer than any even the closest competitor seano is normally just a two-year spot
00:10:02.36 --> 00:10:08.44 animal king who's the seano during world war two he serves for four but after king nobody
00:10:08.44 --> 00:10:15.16 else comes close except Burke and Burke's there for six years and whenever I know that you
00:10:15.16 --> 00:10:20.20 know you take pictures of your watch and you're still working at a fourth thirty just funny because
00:10:20.20 --> 00:10:24.68 I often thought that I should start taking a picture of my watch when I sit down like computers
00:10:24.68 --> 00:10:31.64 to writing I'm not sure would be motivating but whenever I hear somebody talk about how you have to
00:10:32.36 --> 00:10:38.36 get eight hours asleep and I sleep the most important thing like man I know that you're wrong
00:10:38.36 --> 00:10:43.64 and I know because of Burke I know because of every you know other people you hi achievers like
00:10:43.64 --> 00:10:52.52 somebody like Burke he never slept yeah that that why that passage stood out to me and look I've
00:10:52.52 --> 00:10:58.20 got so many marks in this book now from the last time we did this and just from reading it but that
00:10:58.20 --> 00:11:07.48 that idea that here's this guy who's listening to a young ensin go down with his ship and he's
00:11:07.48 --> 00:11:12.04 thinking to himself you know after this guy says forgive me the mistakes I'm about to make and you know
00:11:12.04 --> 00:11:17.64 Arlie Burke sitting there thinking he could have taught him he could have given him a heads up he could have
00:11:17.64 --> 00:11:23.24 given whoever that commander was or the lieutenant commander or the lieutenant that was above
00:11:23.24 --> 00:11:27.80 this guy in the chain of command all these guys could he could have taught them something that
00:11:27.80 --> 00:11:33.64 maybe they wouldn't be in this situation and just knowing that every effort that you gave
00:11:33.64 --> 00:11:39.64 to pass on the lessons they failed and now this this guy is just young man just young
00:11:39.64 --> 00:11:43.80 ensin is dying and he's gonna go down with his ship with all these sailors on board and
00:11:44.84 --> 00:11:51.24 there's there's just all these lessons and and I mean there's so many times where when I was in
00:11:51.24 --> 00:11:57.32 the teams well good example is Mike Thornton you know Mike Thornton came on this podcast a
00:11:57.32 --> 00:12:06.68 couple years ago and we went moment by moment and debriefed the the operation where he for which he
00:12:06.68 --> 00:12:12.60 was awarded the the Medal of Honor and it's it's three hours it's like a three hour debrief
00:12:13.96 --> 00:12:20.92 and I was in the sealed teams with at the same time as Mike Thornton I knew Mike Thornton
00:12:21.56 --> 00:12:24.84 I had met Mike Thornton several occasions I'd spent time with Mike Thornton
00:12:26.84 --> 00:12:32.68 but I'd never gotten like a full debrief of what happened and you think to yourself all those
00:12:32.68 --> 00:12:38.52 lessons that didn't get passed on until he came on the podcast and told me like all these
00:12:38.52 --> 00:12:44.60 little lessons and then you start thinking about someone like Burke or or this entire book that you've
00:12:44.60 --> 00:12:51.24 written where there's just all these lessons that are completely forgotten and well I should say they're
00:12:51.24 --> 00:12:54.60 almost completely forgotten I don't know if they're completely forgotten I know I know the point
00:12:54.60 --> 00:12:59.72 you're trying to make and I agree like um since the book has come out I've been keeping a list there's
00:12:59.72 --> 00:13:05.08 been 12 12 guys that I interviewed in the course of the book that aren't with us anymore and
00:13:06.44 --> 00:13:10.68 I always think like what what happened if I had started the book a year late or a year later
00:13:10.68 --> 00:13:14.76 than I did or what opportunities did I miss because I started the book when I did and not two
00:13:14.76 --> 00:13:20.36 years earlier like how many how many stories did I miss or how many lessons did I miss um
00:13:20.36 --> 00:13:26.44 the one thing that I think about when I think of like um you know somebody who's as young as
00:13:26.44 --> 00:13:31.64 that Ensign was in the section that you read um who's going down I mean that Ensign
00:13:31.64 --> 00:13:35.24 Mike Thornton when he's I think Mike Thornton was 25 when he rescued Tommy Norse
00:13:37.16 --> 00:13:41.48 he's not old enough I mean he's old enough to he's he's a he's a grown man I mean he's uh
00:13:43.48 --> 00:13:47.96 he has a 25 year old's perspective on life but he doesn't have all the context that you know
00:13:47.96 --> 00:13:53.40 that you and I have and echo we live long lives I mean we've we've been around here for a minute
00:13:53.40 --> 00:14:01.56 and we've collected stories and we've collected context um and we have uh you know enough um
00:14:01.56 --> 00:14:09.64 you know ammunition you know whether it's morally or or whatever to help us or to convince us
00:14:09.64 --> 00:14:16.20 to to to make right decisions um but somebody's 25 years old or this Ensign I imagine this
00:14:16.20 --> 00:14:21.88 Ensign you know probably 22 years old like I just didn't know anything doesn't know anything about
00:14:21.88 --> 00:14:28.76 the world he hasn't heard you know stories you know like the one that you just read um but what
00:14:28.76 --> 00:14:35.000 he does have uh he has this uh he's been imprinted by the institution that he served him and
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.96 by the people that are around him um and that's I think that's an important um thing you know
00:14:41.96 --> 00:14:47.24 buddhas or bootcamp does you're you're taking uh young folks and you know from lots of
00:14:47.24 --> 00:14:51.96 different backgrounds and without you know the context that we have as you get older and you read books
00:14:51.96 --> 00:14:57.80 and you have these experiences but you imprint you know the values of that institution on these
00:14:57.80 --> 00:15:06.76 people and you give them uh new mandates for what's expected um and that's cool yeah and I appreciate
00:15:06.76 --> 00:15:14.52 that but you know like like I said this this Ensign wasn't in charge of the ship right there was
00:15:14.52 --> 00:15:21.64 uh there was an exo there was a seal there was an ops boss there all now dead and even with the
00:15:21.64 --> 00:15:29.16 imprints of kind of the broad value system that we have in the navy or the broad value system that
00:15:29.16 --> 00:15:34.76 you have in the Marine Corps the broad value system that you have in the army there are actual
00:15:34.76 --> 00:15:42.36 tactics that you can know that can save your ass in certain situations and you know when I was
00:15:42.36 --> 00:15:47.72 in trade at like I remember sometimes especially when I first got home from her body I would be
00:15:47.72 --> 00:15:53.24 watching a guy move through the streets in in Mount training right and I would feel like sick
00:15:53.24 --> 00:16:00.20 to my stomach if a guy wasn't taking cover and it's a really simple thing that hate someone tells
00:16:00.20 --> 00:16:04.92 you like listen man only move from cover to cover don't ever be in a spot where you're standing
00:16:04.92 --> 00:16:09.08 and you're not in cover don't ever let that happen when you're not behind cover you're moving
00:16:09.08 --> 00:16:14.76 that's the way it is obviously wasn't instinctual to a bunch of people coming through you know
00:16:14.76 --> 00:16:20.20 advanced seal training coming coming through work up there would be out of every 10 new guys there
00:16:20.20 --> 00:16:23.64 would be three of them that would stand around in the open like nothing's gonna happen to them
00:16:24.20 --> 00:16:27.48 and so there's there's instincts and that's why when I read this past I was like
00:16:28.52 --> 00:16:34.84 the feeling of the sickness that I can only imagine it's even worse for him because he's thinking
00:16:34.84 --> 00:16:41.56 here's another ship with however many 300 souls going down on it and I know that
00:16:43.24 --> 00:16:48.84 I could have had them you know do do whatever they could have done differently and the
00:16:48.84 --> 00:16:53.96 lessons just didn't get passed on and and that's why to me this book that you've written is so
00:16:53.96 --> 00:17:00.04 important because it does have lessons that I saw us relearn some of the lessons that you've
00:17:00.04 --> 00:17:08.28 gotten this book I watched this happen and so I'm glad I'm look I wish you would have written it earlier
00:17:08.28 --> 00:17:13.32 right I wish you would have written it 10 years ago or 15 years ago but you didn't because you're lazy
00:17:16.12 --> 00:17:22.44 but it took you seven years to write this thing and the lessons are just they're just
00:17:22.44 --> 00:17:29.32 awesome and they're important and you know you know the whole dynamic when you understand the
00:17:29.32 --> 00:17:39.96 whole dynamic of where where this personality comes from where this mode of operating that
00:17:39.96 --> 00:17:43.08 that is sort of look the seal teams everyone every sales a little bit different but there's some
00:17:43.08 --> 00:17:47.88 core things there that are that they're gonna be there no matter what seal you talked to from what
00:17:47.88 --> 00:17:54.92 generation they've got this they got a couple things in their soul and when people start to on those
00:17:54.92 --> 00:17:59.72 think conveyed but when people start to understand where that thing that little nugget in their soul
00:17:59.72 --> 00:18:04.60 where that came from and they go oh that's actually not just a that's not just a rock that's a cornerstone
00:18:04.60 --> 00:18:07.88 and we should focus on that we should remember that we should know where that came from we should
00:18:07.88 --> 00:18:13.72 know why that was important that we had that characteristic or we had that that that way of thinking
00:18:13.72 --> 00:18:21.64 about things and for me this book illuminated so many threads of the thought process that we have as
00:18:21.64 --> 00:18:26.92 seals where they came from to make sure when someone says well you know we need to just fall
00:18:26.92 --> 00:18:31.40 in mind with an answer actually we don't need to just fall in mind there's a reason that we think this
00:18:31.40 --> 00:18:35.24 way there's a reason that it's beneficial there's a reason that it's beneficial to keep an open mind
00:18:35.96 --> 00:18:39.56 there's a reason that it's beneficial to utilize decentralized command there's a reason for those
00:18:39.56 --> 00:18:43.72 things and we should never forget where they came from and the more we understand where they came from
00:18:43.72 --> 00:18:51.56 the more we can act upon them correctly all right so with that I'm sorry your book it's
00:18:51.56 --> 00:18:59.08 me super far to put about some stuff on the same thing so this uh my idea and I don't know how
00:18:59.08 --> 00:19:04.12 well we're gonna be able to stick this idea um because you have way too much freaking you have
00:19:04.12 --> 00:19:08.20 way too many facts and stories running around in your head and I've got too many questions running
00:19:08.20 --> 00:19:13.32 around in mind but my idea was to try and go through some of the chapters and like you just said you
00:19:13.32 --> 00:19:18.04 just said you got about 15 pages cut out 15 pages of early book by way did you actually write those
00:19:18.04 --> 00:19:23.16 15 pages yeah they're written oh yeah I mean I had that's horrible some of it's like you know
00:19:23.16 --> 00:19:27.96 extremely some of it's like some of it's notes no no no I mean it's all written and it's all like I
00:19:27.96 --> 00:19:33.08 mean I mean I have not a paragraph but I have a couple sentences on Birch's wife like
00:19:34.04 --> 00:19:40.12 all right I need not all of the states you know but when you find like yeah I don't know
00:19:40.68 --> 00:19:45.56 your experience but when you're editing like if you're writing a novel I expect like the
00:19:45.56 --> 00:19:51.32 the uh the impulse when you're you know cutting stuff is that you know you have a turner phrase
00:19:51.32 --> 00:19:55.64 that you're really liking you're like oh man that is I mean that's the best thing that's been
00:19:55.64 --> 00:20:00.28 written since the Bible and you want to get rid of it and your editor tells you well nobody gets
00:20:00.28 --> 00:20:05.64 what you're trying to say it sucks you know you need to lose it but I think when you're you know
00:20:05.64 --> 00:20:11.16 when you're writing history uh and you're you've done all this research you've followed you know
00:20:11.16 --> 00:20:15.48 you know you know so many rabbit holes you've done so many requests the Navy yard or wherever you've
00:20:15.48 --> 00:20:19.80 gotten your material uh and you've found what you know think you think is this incredible document
00:20:20.52 --> 00:20:25.08 you want to use that stuff you you mean you fought for it you mean you want to put it in there
00:20:26.28 --> 00:20:32.84 I mean I have a lot of detail in these sentences I and I don't do that you know to
00:20:33.64 --> 00:20:39.48 make a reader you know frustrated I have it because you know I'm the way that I'm writing
00:20:39.48 --> 00:20:43.32 as I have four note cards that I'll sit in front of me and those four note cards you will usually
00:20:43.32 --> 00:20:46.84 have you know two or three points on them all star which one which point I have on each not
00:20:46.84 --> 00:20:52.04 note card and be like I want to put that that net in one sentence how do I do that I had a
00:20:52.04 --> 00:20:57.96 way fit all that you know stuff in there so yes I did I cut probably between ten and fifteen pages
00:20:57.96 --> 00:21:04.52 of Berks biography however when I when I rewrote the chapter I didn't completely lose that I mean
00:21:04.52 --> 00:21:09.96 I try to say that I I left as much on the field as possible I just you know compressed it into
00:21:09.96 --> 00:21:16.76 this really really you know tight diamond of of information but yeah everybody I mean I there were
00:21:16.76 --> 00:21:22.68 whole characters that I cut and I got better as time went on so um not when I was thinking about
00:21:22.68 --> 00:21:26.84 how we were going to do this and I started to go back through you know chapter by chapter you know
00:21:26.84 --> 00:21:31.88 what were sections that I cut what were sections that I lost and um you know not just characters
00:21:31.88 --> 00:21:37.48 but entire episodes I saw um I saw in these chapters my notes that I was putting together we're
00:21:37.48 --> 00:21:42.52 getting shorter and shorter and shorter each chapter because I was learning as I was doing this
00:21:42.52 --> 00:21:47.000 whole book and I did my research and I did my writing chapter by chapter I would research and write
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.40 one chapter I would go back to an archive I'd collect all the stuff and I'd write that next chapter
00:21:51.40 --> 00:21:57.08 and then I'd do it again for the third chapter for whatever I was doing and I got better as I went
00:21:57.08 --> 00:22:03.56 um I'd rather identify what what was going to fit and also you must have seen a better
00:22:03.56 --> 00:22:07.56 of clear vision of the story arc yes and so you knew what was important and what was not
00:22:07.56 --> 00:22:13.96 much better and much better idea of the story and much better um respect for my reader
00:22:14.84 --> 00:22:19.000 because I was you know when I was reading this I was completely in love with my own pen
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.84 I thought everything I wrote was fantastic I wrote the first chapter as the well
00:22:22.84 --> 00:22:27.64 and I'm I probably should just send this off to the Pulitzer Committee so they have just you
00:22:27.64 --> 00:22:34.36 know have this thing up front they'll they'll know what's coming eventually um but you know when I
00:22:34.36 --> 00:22:39.32 reread that chapter six months after I'd written it and I saw it's like I'm not sure why that
00:22:39.32 --> 00:22:44.92 character is in here it's like oh that I don't know about him either I found myself I had like
00:22:44.92 --> 00:22:51.16 I I did five introductions of five different characters in that first chapter before I really got
00:22:51.16 --> 00:22:57.24 to Carlson and his readers like that was I doing like I don't even know why I spent all that time
00:22:57.24 --> 00:23:01.24 doing it like I was just but I was learning you know even you're you're learning the process and
00:23:01.24 --> 00:23:07.80 you're learning how to get better as you go um but yeah you seem to think about the
00:23:08.44 --> 00:23:12.52 you seem to think about the reader a lot more than I do or you're like I don't want to put the
00:23:12.52 --> 00:23:16.92 reader through this I'm like well I'm the reader I mean I'm the reader I'm my imaginary I mean
00:23:16.92 --> 00:23:22.36 I'm I'm my own reader like I wrote like I said I wrote the book that I wanted to read and I you know
00:23:23.24 --> 00:23:30.04 but like you you have to think about your your reader you have to I released I felt felt like I have
00:23:30.04 --> 00:23:33.88 to think about my reader because otherwise I'm writing a diary I don't want to write a diary I
00:23:33.88 --> 00:23:37.16 want people to read what I'm writing I guess it closest I would come to you like a does this
00:23:37.16 --> 00:23:40.36 would this make sense if I was reading it so yeah I guess yeah you're you're you're about the
00:23:40.36 --> 00:23:44.04 reader a little bit you're your reader you're I mean I don't think about the reader sounds like
00:23:44.04 --> 00:23:47.56 you think about the reader sympathetically they're getting no sympathy for the reader you're
00:23:47.56 --> 00:23:53.88 like well I don't want to put the reader through some like I had the reader but I don't know if I
00:23:53.88 --> 00:24:02.04 like I my reader was I wanted it to be I wanted my reader to be you know a teen guy I wanted
00:24:02.04 --> 00:24:06.20 this book to be for this he was but I wanted my mom to be able to read it to so that when I was
00:24:06.20 --> 00:24:13.08 thinking like when I wrote this paragraph up was it sufficiently dense was it sufficiently what was
00:24:13.08 --> 00:24:18.60 there was there enough material and enough interesting things on that to you know to make me like
00:24:18.60 --> 00:24:23.40 oh that's that's good stuff but was it also written well enough that my mom could understand it
00:24:23.40 --> 00:24:28.20 that's what I was thinking about well also the last time that we were on here you asked me what my
00:24:28.20 --> 00:24:33.32 mom did and I just said that she was a housewife how that girl didn't go over creation so what's the
00:24:33.32 --> 00:24:40.76 real deal yeah I don't I don't have a great my mom was ever just said everything you set yourself up
00:24:40.76 --> 00:24:47.48 and that's the right thing she was got she was the chief of staff there you go that's a that's
00:24:47.48 --> 00:24:51.24 sounds better than housewife I guess yeah I'm unless you're a badass housewife in which
00:24:51.24 --> 00:24:55.32 case you're like yeah I'm a badass housewife what's up we know what that entails that means
00:24:55.32 --> 00:25:02.44 I'm the the the chief staff officer the chief financial officer the troop motivator you're everything
00:25:02.44 --> 00:25:08.20 yeah get an after it so there you go mom's so now she can stop being met at me it's a
00:25:08.20 --> 00:25:13.48 second let's later all right so my my thought was we go through this and talk about some of it
00:25:13.48 --> 00:25:17.24 because you know you and I had conversations during the during the podcast after the podcast
00:25:17.24 --> 00:25:20.52 about the amount of people the same thing you're saying right now you had to just cut things out
00:25:20.52 --> 00:25:26.52 cut stories out yeah and so many of these things can can be their own book can be their own store
00:25:26.52 --> 00:25:30.76 you could peel pull back the pull the thread or any of these characters and you can you could
00:25:30.76 --> 00:25:36.12 have your own book you have another book on just about any of these characters um but I thought just
00:25:36.12 --> 00:25:40.52 going through some of the chapter it's going through the chapters and talking about some of the
00:25:40.52 --> 00:25:46.28 things that didn't quite make it uh chapter one is called the reluct by the way I was thinking
00:25:46.28 --> 00:25:50.04 about this as I was putting this together chapter one is called the reluctant creation and violent
00:25:50.04 --> 00:25:54.60 demise of the Navy's first commandos the Marine Corps Raiders your subtitles for each chapter
00:25:54.60 --> 00:25:59.96 indicate that you have a lot to say and this is going to be a long book like chapter one the
00:25:59.96 --> 00:26:06.04 reluctant you know my books have like chapter one get some you know boom we're done right chapter two
00:26:06.04 --> 00:26:10.04 get more like I'm an idiot you're over here the reluctant creation and final demise of the
00:26:10.04 --> 00:26:14.84 Navy's first commandos the Marine Corps Raiders that was my editors that was Julian Pavilion he
00:26:14.84 --> 00:26:20.12 he sort of insisted so each of my chapters or something like I don't know like it wasn't it wasn't
00:26:20.12 --> 00:26:25.56 as tight as like Carlson's Raiders but it was something like the the only one that I remember is
00:26:25.56 --> 00:26:29.80 for chapter five from my unit days it was like the the Merum and before before they had come up with
00:26:29.80 --> 00:26:33.96 the frogmen is like a moniker for them they were calling them like the really clunky
00:26:33.96 --> 00:26:38.04 oh god that's awful especially after that move what's that movie echo Charles
00:26:38.04 --> 00:26:43.72 which one uh Zulander you know what I'm talking about so in the movie Zulander
00:26:43.72 --> 00:26:50.84 which has Owen Wilson in it who's like one of my favorite people all the time that guy seems so
00:26:50.84 --> 00:26:57.80 chill and cool and it also has Ben still or so Ben still plays like I was really dumb model
00:26:57.80 --> 00:27:04.52 a man model right and he comes from some fregan mining town in Pennsylvania or something
00:27:04.52 --> 00:27:09.88 and he's in this bar with his daddy's trying to be like more manly and his dad's in there
00:27:10.44 --> 00:27:16.36 and his dad's played by John Void John Void for dinner all they're all like covered in mine dust
00:27:16.36 --> 00:27:23.48 and Vince Fonds and there are no lines he's no line just no line just being tough and so Ben still
00:27:23.48 --> 00:27:30.28 is in there trying to be tougher and a and a commercial comes on the TV and it's him advertised
00:27:30.28 --> 00:27:36.36 some like fragrance and he's dressed up like a mermaid and his dad's like can't have you running
00:27:36.36 --> 00:27:44.20 around here as a damn mermaid and he says not a mermaid dad it's merman so that's what I thought
00:27:44.20 --> 00:27:48.44 of what I saw that's the I was reading through it just like did we really have to go there with the
00:27:48.44 --> 00:27:55.56 merman clunky's at the least all right so so but my yes so his point was you need to give the
00:27:55.56 --> 00:28:02.52 reader some idea of what's in store for them like if you start a chapter on the if you okay so
00:28:03.16 --> 00:28:09.64 imagine your reader you're picking up a book ostensibly about the Navy seals and that first chapter
00:28:09.64 --> 00:28:14.12 is you know you're reading paid you know three pages and it's all about the Marine Corps what the
00:28:14.12 --> 00:28:20.04 hell are you doing you have to give you know your reader some idea of what this is about and you know
00:28:20.04 --> 00:28:25.32 when I when I thought about you know I completely made sense because you know now I'm I'm not just doing
00:28:25.32 --> 00:28:30.92 the you know the reader you know help on chapter one with the Marine Corps raiders but I'm going to
00:28:30.92 --> 00:28:34.68 help I'm going to be helping the reader when it gets to the army rangers and everything else like
00:28:34.68 --> 00:28:39.48 it has to tie back and each of these chapters have to tie back and to the seal teams it had to be
00:28:39.48 --> 00:28:45.40 relevant to you know how the Navy had you know created this first yeah well there's why we have the
00:28:45.40 --> 00:28:50.20 clunky that's why you have the big long big long title for your chapters and you you're one of
00:28:50.20 --> 00:28:55.80 these guys that pulls off like hey if I'm just really nice maybe juggle will leave me alone you're
00:28:55.80 --> 00:28:59.56 like you gave this rooper nice explanation now I kind of feel bad like no that's a good title
00:29:00.52 --> 00:29:05.56 you did good you put me in check all humble and I'm all I got a major I'll just go I'll leave you
00:29:05.56 --> 00:29:15.72 so uh Marine Corps let's talk about this chapter I know one of the guys that you mentioned to me
00:29:15.72 --> 00:29:23.08 as a guy named Pete Ellis Pete Ellis he didn't make the cut huh no I thought Pete Ellis
00:29:23.08 --> 00:29:28.92 of Pete Ellis is relevant because Pete Ellis is the he's the Marine he's a first world war
00:29:28.92 --> 00:29:36.68 Marine who is he's the first Marine to articulate a vision for the Marine Corps that is more than just a
00:29:37.48 --> 00:29:42.60 subordinate service to the US Navy or the Navy's police force he imagines after he sees what the
00:29:42.60 --> 00:29:48.84 Marine Corps capable of on the Western Front the Marine Corps is the when World War I starts
00:29:49.72 --> 00:29:55.16 and the US military finds itself in the trenches not just in the trenches but then moving on the
00:29:55.16 --> 00:30:02.52 German Army the best force that the United States military has is the Marine Corps so there's all these
00:30:02.52 --> 00:30:08.44 marine officers staff officers, Marine commanders who suddenly by comparison with their peers in the
00:30:08.44 --> 00:30:15.64 US Army see that the Marine Corps is the best service the most capable service you know that we have
00:30:15.64 --> 00:30:22.20 so why not you know start thinking beyond you know just this idea of being you know the ship or
00:30:22.20 --> 00:30:27.56 the ship born utility force for the US Navy why not start thinking of the US Marine Corps as
00:30:27.56 --> 00:30:33.24 almost a rival to the US Army so in order to do that in order to justify that in Congress
00:30:34.84 --> 00:30:40.76 the Marine Corps had to articulate a mission for itself and that mission was you know it was essentially
00:30:40.76 --> 00:30:46.92 come up with by Pete Ellis Pete Ellis he identifies the enemy or at least you know he's writing this in
00:30:46.92 --> 00:30:54.28 1922 20 years before World War II starts he knows that the next war the US is in is going to be
00:30:54.28 --> 00:31:01.48 with Imperial Japan he knows how rapacious Japan is he knows their ambitions to dominate all of Asia
00:31:01.88 --> 00:31:07.88 and if the US military wants to confront Japan it's going to have to have a force capable of doing that
00:31:07.88 --> 00:31:15.40 a force that's not just you know like I said the ship born utility force of Raiders or
00:31:15.40 --> 00:31:20.04 jungle fighters anything like that they're going to have to have all the logistics capable of
00:31:20.04 --> 00:31:29.08 supporting an amphibious army ashore artillery aircraft logistics ships landing craft all that stuff
00:31:29.08 --> 00:31:35.96 so he is the one that comes up with this plan problem with Pete Ellis is he is a personal disaster
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.56 he is nobody that I wrote about is as much of a liberty risk I mean he is
00:31:43.56 --> 00:31:52.04 he suffers from depression something they call niraznia and he whenever he when he's writing this
00:31:52.04 --> 00:31:56.68 plan the advanced base operations for Micronesia when he's writing when he's drafting this plan
00:31:56.68 --> 00:32:02.60 for the Marine Corps he's doing periodic bouts at the mental hospital in Washington DC he
00:32:05.08 --> 00:32:11.88 was eventually what he doing World War I he was a staff officer but I I wasn't completely clear on
00:32:11.88 --> 00:32:20.12 his combat record I got the sense that he actually saw a decent amount of combat he he wrote a plan
00:32:20.12 --> 00:32:24.92 of operations for I can't remember which assault it was I think it was on the blockmonks section
00:32:24.92 --> 00:32:29.32 of the hidden bird line but it was it was supposed it was supposed to be a brilliant operational
00:32:29.32 --> 00:32:37.16 plan and it was it was totally successful and it was I think it was noticed by purging at one point
00:32:37.16 --> 00:32:44.60 it was called one of the best plans in the war but after that you know when he's you know
00:32:44.60 --> 00:32:51.40 during this period of the 20s after one bout in a mental institution he convinces the secretary
00:32:51.40 --> 00:32:55.80 the navy or the undersecretary the navy which is the hero's about junior at the time to send him
00:32:55.80 --> 00:33:02.20 on a like on an island hopping survey of the central pacific so he can justify or so he can prove
00:33:02.20 --> 00:33:07.24 what he suspects which is the Japanese are building all these island readouts throughout the
00:33:07.24 --> 00:33:14.20 center throughout the pacific he gets the authorization by a tenoros of el junior he goes out there
00:33:15.32 --> 00:33:22.44 something happens at one of these island bars he starts announcing his intentions of well he's on a
00:33:22.44 --> 00:33:30.68 bender the spies trying like a collective and going to pack off he managed to it manages to escape
00:33:32.28 --> 00:33:38.44 escapes the island makes his way to another island then drinks himself to death there's a you know
00:33:38.44 --> 00:33:45.24 there's a whole cottage industry of writers out there that you know say that he was poisoned or he was
00:33:45.24 --> 00:33:50.68 killed by the Japanese I think he was just a drunk and he just sliver couldn't handle it
00:33:50.68 --> 00:33:57.40 your train I don't know what the name of the place is but for a while we were using some
00:33:57.40 --> 00:34:02.52 facility and I don't want to name it but you'll know what I'm talking about that was used to be
00:34:02.52 --> 00:34:08.28 an institution like a mental institution you're training that place I was familiar
00:34:08.28 --> 00:34:13.72 and for a while we in the teams were going to some place that was formerly a mental institution
00:34:13.72 --> 00:34:24.44 and it was creepy creepy like you'd go into certain it's in the middle of the country kind of
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.92 man it was weird you'd go into rums and you'd just like look around and there'd be weird
00:34:34.52 --> 00:34:41.88 it was weird it was really weird you know like you get a little bit of scary that's you know
00:34:41.88 --> 00:34:46.28 saying we're you know it's night and you you're with like one other dude you're standing
00:34:46.28 --> 00:34:51.80 some weird hallway and there and it's it looks like it's from 1922 that's what maybe think of it
00:34:51.80 --> 00:34:59.48 like 1922 well you know you start talking about what a mental institution was like in 1922 it's not
00:34:59.48 --> 00:35:06.20 like what it's like now right now it's you know probably they've got nice windows and they want to
00:35:06.20 --> 00:35:11.24 make things safe and open for people to understand and learn and feel good about themselves this was
00:35:11.24 --> 00:35:16.12 not the scenario in this place where I trained at at all man like what like in a asylum yes
00:35:16.12 --> 00:35:20.68 no 100% it was kind of yeah it was like an asylum he thought it was haunted that's what you're
00:35:20.68 --> 00:35:26.28 scared kind of I think it's probably just a file or even think that too I mean when you you see
00:35:26.28 --> 00:35:30.92 like not just you know a silence but there's this been there's been the story of this
00:35:31.56 --> 00:35:37.000 orphanage in Canada you know that had all these indigenous children they're finding just mass
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:45.08 mass of burial plots now of all these kids that were killed there it's horrific yeah well that was
00:35:45.08 --> 00:35:49.88 uh I'm not an expert on that right yeah well that was that was one of the goals was to just
00:35:49.88 --> 00:35:55.88 reeducate the children see it happening now right now with our school systems kids are getting
00:35:55.88 --> 00:36:06.76 reeducated in a new way speaking of ending up in the silence so uh there's another character
00:36:06.76 --> 00:36:17.000 that's uh yeah a guy named Red Mike yeah I was hoping you'd ask about him you could write a
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:24.04 book about Red Mike that's uh Red Mike Hudson he's uh so when I was trying to you know sort through the
00:36:25.32 --> 00:36:30.68 the relevance of the Raiders the Raiders are important to the history of the seal teams because
00:36:30.68 --> 00:36:37.48 uh they're the first instance where the navy telegraphs its desire for its own rating force uh they
00:36:37.48 --> 00:36:44.12 want to um broadcast or they want to um franchise raids throughout the Pacific to draw the
00:36:44.12 --> 00:36:49.40 Japanese attention away from the areas that they're about to attack so Japanese defenses are
00:36:49.40 --> 00:36:56.28 too consolidated they want to spread them out on all these islands so uh when before uh the invasion
00:36:56.28 --> 00:37:01.48 of Guadalcanau uh it was the navy's idea to pull the Japanese attention all the way to the central
00:37:01.48 --> 00:37:09.24 Pacific you know 2,000 miles north um so the idea is launch some submarine raiders on these things
00:37:11.64 --> 00:37:16.12 and uh you know like I said spread the spread Japanese attention spread Japanese defenses
00:37:17.16 --> 00:37:21.24 and I was looking when I knew that you know I knew that that's that was the goal and there were
00:37:21.24 --> 00:37:25.96 two uh Raider battalions that do it or that there were designed to do it the first Raider battalion
00:37:25.96 --> 00:37:30.20 and the second Raider battalion now I knew the second Raider battalion had taken making and that
00:37:30.20 --> 00:37:36.52 was probably more in keeping with uh the the point that I needed to make uh to launch pad into
00:37:36.52 --> 00:37:41.88 my second chapter what I didn't like was that I would have to spend so much time with Evans Carlson
00:37:41.88 --> 00:37:48.04 now if you read the book Evans Carlson is one of probably the three most peculiar characters in the
00:37:48.04 --> 00:37:54.20 book uh he's really frustrating um and you know you you if you're writing history you know the
00:37:54.20 --> 00:37:58.20 goal is always to be objective with characters you don't want to telegraph to your reader that you
00:37:58.20 --> 00:38:06.84 don't like somebody uh Evans Carlson is a as a person it's hard not to dislike merit uh red mic
00:38:06.84 --> 00:38:17.48 heads in on the other hand is uh he's incredible like you I mean he's um I mean uh he he was incredible
00:38:17.48 --> 00:38:21.72 before the war in Nicaragua he he he he he fought he fought through all these little banana wars
00:38:21.72 --> 00:38:28.84 like I know that the Marine Corps has this love affair with uh chesty polar um there's no reason
00:38:28.84 --> 00:38:36.04 that uh they should have any less affinity for red mic heads and he's everywhere uh during World War
00:38:36.04 --> 00:38:43.80 II um lead some of the most daring um assaults of the war he's at uh to la guadal canal he's at
00:38:43.80 --> 00:38:51.08 tarawai I mean three major uh uh battles in Marine Corps history he's got a I think he had two navy
00:38:51.08 --> 00:38:58.76 crosses a metal on her silver stars I mean he was he was incredible um and he's got a terribly
00:38:58.76 --> 00:39:07.32 tragic end he um it's bizarre it is bizarre did you read about him he yeah he uh he he he leaves the
00:39:07.32 --> 00:39:12.84 navy he leaves the Marine Corps uh under protest when uh during the other revolt of the
00:39:12.84 --> 00:39:18.36 animals uh after World War II right before the Korean War um when the army and the air force kind of
00:39:18.36 --> 00:39:23.56 collaborated to uh strip the navy in the Marine Corps of funding uh he resigns the Marine Corps
00:39:23.56 --> 00:39:31.32 and protests so he can uh protest more loudly um he has a series of jobs and eventually he
00:39:31.32 --> 00:39:37.80 commit suicide and his garage he um I don't know I mean I that's one of those you don't hear a lot
00:39:37.80 --> 00:39:45.80 of uh World War II veterans that uh that the the made that decision um uh I mean it stands to the
00:39:45.80 --> 00:39:50.12 reason you know considering everything that we're going through right now I mean someone who has gone
00:39:50.12 --> 00:39:56.20 through as much as you know red mic Edson did had suffered as many blast injuries as he no doubt
00:39:56.20 --> 00:40:01.96 you know suffered um I think he was probably dealing with all the same uh same things that
00:40:01.96 --> 00:40:10.60 so many of our friends are yeah so yeah I think that idea of resigning in protest and what you get
00:40:10.60 --> 00:40:17.80 from it where where it ends up is a tough thing to talk about because once you're done yeah you're
00:40:17.80 --> 00:40:23.64 done you're done and actually um I think it was a green during the Vietnam War addressed it
00:40:23.64 --> 00:40:29.000 who he was like the common on the Marine Corps I can't I forgive my memory but you know he was
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.08 getting interviewed well why did you you know leave because you got Mac Mara who's a jackass you
00:40:33.08 --> 00:40:38.44 got LBJ who's a total jackass maybe it's time just to you know make your statement hey I
00:40:38.44 --> 00:40:42.76 and he said look I'll be in the news for for 48 hours and then that's it that'll have another guy
00:40:42.76 --> 00:40:47.64 and I'll have no influence and that's you know I've often talked about hack or through in the same
00:40:47.64 --> 00:40:51.000 thing Vietnam you know he could have been a division he could have been a brigade commander could have been
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000 a division commander would have had whatever thousands of troops underneath him that he could have
00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:03.48 fought in a different way but instead he sort of resigned in protest and and yeah you know there's
00:41:03.48 --> 00:41:13.48 there's another um the commanding officer of uh I want to say the hospitality in World War I but
00:41:13.48 --> 00:41:21.16 he was a metal of honor recipient and he killed himself after the he was one of the Paul Bears
00:41:22.04 --> 00:41:30.28 at the tune for the tune of the unknown soldier and you know that happened I want to say like
00:41:30.28 --> 00:41:35.32 1919 was when they actually had everything set up for the to dedicate the tune with the unknown
00:41:35.32 --> 00:41:43.56 soldier he was has a metal of honor recipient he was one of the guys that um that was one of those
00:41:43.56 --> 00:41:52.76 Paul Bears and then I think it was about a year later he booked a uh C passage from New York to
00:41:52.76 --> 00:41:57.96 Cubar's New York to Florida or something and then wrote a note and disappeared you know killed
00:41:57.96 --> 00:42:04.60 himself did you read that Patrick go down all the what is it called I can't remember what it
00:42:04.60 --> 00:42:08.68 what it's called I was just one that I had seen it was it looked interesting what's it about
00:42:09.40 --> 00:42:14.68 it's about the tune of the unknown soldier okay no I did not read it I'll be curious to read it it's
00:42:14.68 --> 00:42:23.000 about I think it's about all all the Paul Bears in that uh oh wow there's a problem
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:30.84 and it will a little bit what what was it that you didn't like about Carlson so much Carlson
00:42:30.84 --> 00:42:46.76 he's just man Carlson is um Carlson there were lots of characters that I came in contact with
00:42:46.76 --> 00:42:55.16 then are other Carlson's their characters that you you know they've they've done and they've done
00:42:55.16 --> 00:43:02.20 an incredible amount for their country and but you can you have the benefit of hindsight you have
00:43:02.20 --> 00:43:09.96 the benefit of perspective and you have to um you have to weigh in on their legacy so
00:43:09.96 --> 00:43:15.88 Carlson done more than me yeah Carlson done more than you I mean he's he's he's he's
00:43:15.88 --> 00:43:21.56 lost through world or two I can't me he's he's not even close like yeah there's nothing we can't
00:43:21.56 --> 00:43:29.48 compare you know our contribution to somebody like Carlson he's he's he's in the first one of the
00:43:29.48 --> 00:43:36.84 first raids of the entire war and then he fights in successive battles the what's important about Carlson
00:43:36.84 --> 00:43:42.04 though is that the Marine Corps um loses all respect for him after the making island raid
00:43:42.04 --> 00:43:46.68 they give him another chance with the long patrol on Guadalcanal and he does admirable work there
00:43:46.68 --> 00:43:54.36 but it's not enough to overshadow uh the the defeat and the uh the aftermath of the making island raid
00:43:54.36 --> 00:44:02.68 the making island raid um it is really known how uh disaster disaster it is until 1943 a whole year
00:44:02.68 --> 00:44:10.28 later when uh U.S. forces retake the island and they discover that the um that the Marines that
00:44:10.28 --> 00:44:16.20 uh they believe to have been drowned uh in the uh evacuation weren't drowned but captured and killed
00:44:16.20 --> 00:44:23.24 it'd be headed by the Japanese um so it's sort of a uh sort of a uh a failure that kind of unfolds over time
00:44:24.28 --> 00:44:30.52 but when the the full scope of the failure the making island raid is understood um the Marine
00:44:30.52 --> 00:44:36.76 Corps never lets Evans Carlson command troops ever again now that's perfectly you know find for
00:44:36.76 --> 00:44:42.28 the Marine Corps leadership they was there something about his personality that is a personality yeah
00:44:42.28 --> 00:44:47.80 but it's also as politics he was uh I think he was a borderline uh communist he was definitely a
00:44:47.80 --> 00:44:56.12 populist um definitely like a uh a socialist populist um but he was um um by the end of the war uh
00:44:56.12 --> 00:45:00.68 he's advocating for the Chinese uh the not the national's Chinese the kind of the Chinese communist
00:45:03.08 --> 00:45:09.08 eventually he he dies and disgrace penniless because he uh he he he he he resigned from the Marine Corps
00:45:10.68 --> 00:45:15.56 well I can't remember exactly what happens to him in the aftermath but I know he has no money
00:45:15.56 --> 00:45:19.88 and Teddy Roosevelt has to pay for his funeral not Teddy Roosevelt um James Roosevelt
00:45:21.32 --> 00:45:25.72 but uh some of it's his personality some of it just he's got he's kind of ponderous
00:45:25.72 --> 00:45:31.32 like uh he's been boring like you know stuffy like uh one of the the things that I think is most
00:45:31.32 --> 00:45:37.16 telling the most descriptive uh episode I have a little vignette and the book is one one of his junior
00:45:37.16 --> 00:45:42.44 officers comes up to him and asks him for you know a few books uh to read uh that will help him
00:45:42.44 --> 00:45:49.80 understand you know the you know how to command or the military art better and and all the books
00:45:49.80 --> 00:45:55.96 the Carlson recommends are books that he's written they you gotta think a lot of yourself
00:45:56.76 --> 00:46:01.64 to tell somebody you know if they're looking for books to read these five that have written so
00:46:01.64 --> 00:46:06.60 he tried to read them and they're all in penetrable boring books of the Chinese like he gave up
00:46:07.72 --> 00:46:11.88 well I'm very thankful right now for the book about face by Colonel David Hachworth
00:46:11.88 --> 00:46:15.24 because when ever somebody says hey what we know what's a good book for me to read about leadership
00:46:15.24 --> 00:46:18.92 and I have said oh yeah I read about face because otherwise I'd be pulling their Carlson
00:46:18.92 --> 00:46:23.48 and telling the leading stream owners of leadership strategy and tactics I'm a loser
00:46:24.44 --> 00:46:28.60 now you don't like me too I'm right up there with Carlson I didn't say well if it wasn't for
00:46:28.60 --> 00:46:33.24 hackworth I'd be right up there with Carlson oh and hang on you haven't seen the books that Carlson
00:46:33.24 --> 00:46:39.08 wrote true I had to read them oh and they just nasty they're just boring do you remember any titles of them
00:46:40.36 --> 00:46:44.60 did you read the whole thing or you like this is ridiculous I get the idea you know since
00:46:44.60 --> 00:46:49.64 a dork in the beginning I did and the beginning I had everything collected I read books that I
00:46:49.64 --> 00:46:55.48 knew that Carlson had read just because I wanted to think like he was thinking he was fascinated
00:46:55.48 --> 00:47:01.40 with Mao so I was reading Mao when he when I was writing this chapter so I got better with my
00:47:01.40 --> 00:47:08.20 research as I went on but at the time like when I wrote chapter one I had not yet stepped into an
00:47:08.20 --> 00:47:15.24 article I wrote the first draft of chapter one just based off of out of books that existed from
00:47:15.24 --> 00:47:20.60 online archives I was able to find a ton of material online on the make and island raid so there
00:47:20.60 --> 00:47:26.12 I mean you pay you know 20 bucks a month you have access to fold three and a couple of other archives
00:47:26.12 --> 00:47:31.16 and you can find the after action report of the USS not all of us or the USS are arguing on
00:47:31.16 --> 00:47:38.12 so you know not having stepped into an archive I was taking advantage of everything else that
00:47:38.12 --> 00:47:43.16 was available to me all the books that Carlson written books that Mao had written you know things
00:47:43.16 --> 00:47:47.72 things like that so I was I was saturated with all this stuff is sort of extraneous as I got
00:47:47.72 --> 00:47:52.36 better you know in my research so chapter two is the first time I stepped foot into an archive and I was like
00:47:52.36 --> 00:48:01.48 oh I can do this better all right well let's get the chapter two chapter two which is called
00:48:04.28 --> 00:48:11.000 the sidelining of the armies and phibia soldier scouts and the call-up of the navy second string sailors
00:48:12.28 --> 00:48:17.96 I think that's pretty good. It's pretty good. Pretty good. All right for the second string sailors that's a nod to
00:48:17.96 --> 00:48:24.44 you know these guys all of these second string sailors were all members every single one of the
00:48:24.44 --> 00:48:31.56 initial navy contingent of the scouts and raider program are all NFL veterans they've all been
00:48:33.08 --> 00:48:41.56 Bucklew he's not only a not only was it college football star not only an NFL star but he was
00:48:41.56 --> 00:48:49.56 uh he was building his own team right he he he founded the Columbus bullies and it would have
00:48:49.56 --> 00:48:56.44 probably been a a successful NFL franchise had it not been for the start of World War II that is a
00:48:56.44 --> 00:49:04.12 freaking legit name to Columbus bullies yeah man if I would have notes if I would have known that
00:49:04.12 --> 00:49:10.12 tasking a bruiser might have been tasking a bullies I guess doesn't quite work quite as well does it
00:49:10.12 --> 00:49:16.68 you know seems kind of sinister yeah but today's I guess I guess especially in today's climate
00:49:16.68 --> 00:49:23.32 you'd be like politically incorrect to call yourself the bullies. I'm a bully. He looked like a bully.
00:49:23.32 --> 00:49:27.80 Do you see pictures of there I mean I went through you know like piles of pictures of Bucklew
00:49:29.16 --> 00:49:34.52 and you know every every picture especially in those World War II days he just looks like a
00:49:34.52 --> 00:49:41.08 like a dick he's like it looks like but that's completely opposite of what everybody I talked to said
00:49:41.08 --> 00:49:47.000 of actually said help you right he said they they all described him as the nicest guy like he was he was
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:55.24 just so much fun to be around uh was super humble um but yeah every picture he managed it's like you know
00:49:55.24 --> 00:50:00.68 go from what I assume is a you know pretty loving guy and two you know has this big scale in his face
00:50:00.68 --> 00:50:06.12 and so what I meant to go down the spaffee little bit of Carlson so Carlson's personality
00:50:06.68 --> 00:50:12.76 what was he a dick was he an arrogant guy no he was he was uh how do you end up on these
00:50:12.76 --> 00:50:19.80 failing missions was it a lack of experience I think it was it was a couple of things he um he was
00:50:19.80 --> 00:50:24.60 infatuated with the Chinese and the Chinese operational system he was the the the the the the the
00:50:24.60 --> 00:50:30.92 Marine Corps are the the slogan the Marine Corps slogan of Ganghaw came from Carlson he that's his
00:50:30.92 --> 00:50:36.36 love that's his lasting legacy to the Marine Corps we understand Ganghaw to me an expression that
00:50:36.36 --> 00:50:42.76 it you know epitomizes you know Marine Corps tenacity in Marine Corps what he what he
00:50:42.76 --> 00:50:47.80 re-consured the machine gun that's yeah it means uh but what up and what it really means
00:50:47.80 --> 00:50:52.84 work together right it's the Chinese expressions of a very I'm not sure if it's even accurate but
00:50:52.84 --> 00:50:58.92 he took it from his time on the long march with Mao's guerrillas yeah it means work together
00:51:00.12 --> 00:51:05.40 but I'll say what when we pick apart uh some of Mao's work on the podcast the thing that's crazy
00:51:05.40 --> 00:51:10.60 about Mao's work is it's basically it's essentially he's saying you need to utilize decentralized
00:51:10.60 --> 00:51:17.40 command to win in military operations and I'm like hey bro Mao you that applies to everything dude
00:51:17.40 --> 00:51:24.20 like you can't have decentralized organization in order to win a war and then centralized your
00:51:24.20 --> 00:51:28.12 government as soon as you're done and think that you can explain how many you know what what
00:51:28.12 --> 00:51:31.80 every farmer in the in the country's supposed to grow and how much we're gonna sell whatever
00:51:31.80 --> 00:51:35.80 we're gonna sell it for like it's crazy that they came to that conclusion I don't understand you
00:51:35.80 --> 00:51:40.12 know there's so many contradictions like that in Molder 2 I mean how are the Germans who are the
00:51:40.12 --> 00:51:45.32 most you know higher archical government system you know on the planet and they managed to produce
00:51:45.32 --> 00:51:50.76 a military they was able to use initiative decentralized command yet at the top they're stultified
00:51:50.76 --> 00:51:55.08 they they don't they can't accomplish anything I mean they can't you know release the panzers
00:51:55.08 --> 00:52:00.12 and d-day like I mean there but yeah at the lower level there you know able to do you know
00:52:00.12 --> 00:52:04.92 able to be dynamic and fluid and agile and all the rest you know what you're when your ego starts
00:52:04.92 --> 00:52:09.24 to get out of control you start to think I better control everything that's what happens
00:52:09.24 --> 00:52:14.20 and you could see I mean it seemed like Hitler did that throughout World War II the more he won
00:52:14.20 --> 00:52:17.64 the more he thought why better control everything see it's working I better just keep doing this and
00:52:17.64 --> 00:52:21.48 by the end it was all on him hey we're gonna we're gonna attack Russia even those generals
00:52:21.48 --> 00:52:27.24 were saying hey bro not a good idea no we're doing it yeah the Carlson the the other thing
00:52:27.24 --> 00:52:31.48 that Carlson did was he was he was so in fact he was the Chinese system that he was
00:52:32.92 --> 00:52:36.12 he would eat with his men he would have these like town hall discussions he would
00:52:36.12 --> 00:52:46.60 he essentially abolished rank except for like in certain aspects he but when he got on the
00:52:46.60 --> 00:52:51.96 I mean when he was you know on the actual make in island raid you can see a clear
00:52:53.08 --> 00:52:59.48 misunderstanding of what the mission was which told me I mean you're that is conveying to you
00:53:00.04 --> 00:53:04.76 he doesn't know what his mission objective is he hasn't thought through he spent two weeks
00:53:04.76 --> 00:53:10.84 sitting on a submarine you know driving across the Pacific under you know completely miserable
00:53:10.84 --> 00:53:16.52 conditions you know sweating you know through his you know yeah like and he finally gets there
00:53:16.52 --> 00:53:21.80 I was on modern day self that had a sea and there are super clean and we're not worried about
00:53:21.80 --> 00:53:27.08 getting depth charges drop them your freaking head imagine it till we transit I can't
00:53:27.08 --> 00:53:34.92 go to a few all up in there and he gets there they get on the island and they look around
00:53:34.92 --> 00:53:39.56 and there's you know there's nothing really to raid I mean just the fact that they landed there
00:53:39.56 --> 00:53:45.000 the fact that they were able to assault the Japanese position and win mission accomplished
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.08 get off the island there's nothing else that you have to do here there's no intelligence that
00:53:49.08 --> 00:53:54.60 you're really gonna gather but he he just he's paralyzed which just you know like I said it conveys
00:53:54.60 --> 00:53:59.48 that he doesn't know what he's doing he doesn't really know what the the purpose of this mission is he
00:53:59.48 --> 00:54:06.36 hasn't connected you know the navy's planners vision you know to their actions on on that island
00:54:07.96 --> 00:54:14.12 and then you're comparing that to Bucklew who was like a good guy a nice guy even though he looked like a
00:54:14.12 --> 00:54:20.76 bully so what you wait what you said this is when you started going into the archives for the
00:54:20.76 --> 00:54:25.80 first time was chapter two chapter two yeah so I couldn't spend enough freaking time invested
00:54:25.80 --> 00:54:33.72 in in research just on just on online reading Carlson's books so you wanted more you're a glutton
00:54:33.72 --> 00:54:38.36 I don't know I mean if I had known so there were two things that I got from chapter one writing
00:54:38.36 --> 00:54:45.16 that I was like I was encouraged because I felt like I was a good researcher I'd put you know
00:54:45.16 --> 00:54:55.08 a compelling chapter together were you a sniper no I was a calm guy in a breacher Jay attack type
00:54:55.08 --> 00:55:01.16 yeah I was a calm guy too but I'm just thinking from a patience perspective yeah I'm really
00:55:01.16 --> 00:55:06.44 antsy it's I find my yeah I I don't know what the the disconnect is because I find myself like
00:55:06.44 --> 00:55:12.36 whenever whenever I'm being instructed now or like I'm I find myself like I get real like I can't
00:55:12.36 --> 00:55:16.84 listen to this guy I gotta get out of here I'll find myself just leaving I would have thought
00:55:16.84 --> 00:55:20.52 you would have gone down the sniper because you have this you know super anyone that's you know
00:55:20.52 --> 00:55:29.16 going into archives and reading Carlson's third book on whatever communist leadership from 1932
00:55:29.16 --> 00:55:33.32 now I didn't want to read it though like I remember looking at that book and just kind of like
00:55:33.32 --> 00:55:38.60 hanging my head like I got to read another one of these things I don't know what I don't know why
00:55:38.60 --> 00:55:42.84 I was compelled to do it I was though and I wanted I just wanted to get it right I wanted to I wanted
00:55:42.84 --> 00:55:48.04 to have a good idea of who this guy was and I also didn't have the benefit of reading Carlson's
00:55:48.04 --> 00:55:52.12 you know letters like I did with other people you know say like a bucklue or how is that
00:55:52.12 --> 00:55:56.36 because Carlson didn't have letters no he has I just didn't go to the archive so now that's the
00:55:56.36 --> 00:56:01.08 archives yes I know you start to find real I'm finding real documents I'm finding like I'm
00:56:01.08 --> 00:56:05.80 getting I know bucklue I know how important because I'm I'm reading their letters I'm reading like
00:56:05.80 --> 00:56:11.16 I'm reading you know the letters of the the the folks that you know created the scouts and
00:56:11.16 --> 00:56:16.92 raiders like pedicord and you know not just you know reading their letters but I'm talking
00:56:16.92 --> 00:56:20.36 to family members talking to people that actually knew them I'm getting a real sense of who they
00:56:20.36 --> 00:56:25.88 are you completely changed how I researched but it it also told me one thing I was not going to
00:56:25.88 --> 00:56:30.28 be able to you know write this book from my basement which is terrifying I was going to have to go
00:56:30.28 --> 00:56:34.76 place as I was going to have to you know hunt for stuff and it was terrifying in the beginning
00:56:34.76 --> 00:56:41.64 and talk to people talk to people the worst you know that that did become like you know the one nice
00:56:41.64 --> 00:56:48.20 thing about you know writing a book about world war two is you don't have anybody arguing with
00:56:48.20 --> 00:56:52.36 what you're going to write about you know they don't exit the rock because I'm around anymore
00:56:52.36 --> 00:56:58.04 yeah when you get to Vietnam I'll tell you I'll tell you a story later in the podcast there's
00:56:58.04 --> 00:57:02.04 people who are still alive that I wrote about the dough like what it was written about the
00:57:02.04 --> 00:57:09.80 couch but you know you you insulate yourself from you know the criticism by your due diligence you
00:57:09.80 --> 00:57:15.48 make sure that you get it right if you don't shame on you but in chapter do you have to retract
00:57:15.48 --> 00:57:19.48 anything no there's nothing that I retracted nothing there's nothing that I would I've
00:57:19.48 --> 00:57:31.56 communicated with with folks you know after um and the one case he the the person I wrote about he
00:57:31.56 --> 00:57:37.32 had just passed away his family read about what I wrote about them it's nothing you know
00:57:37.32 --> 00:57:43.32 particularly damning or anything like that but they weren't they weren't thrilled to hear that
00:57:43.32 --> 00:57:51.48 they're dad had you know not completely succeeded in Vietnam and had kind of run off with a nurse
00:57:51.48 --> 00:58:00.84 in second so what I said to them is you know they they were I think the the note that they sent me
00:58:00.84 --> 00:58:05.16 said you know we were disappointed to learn about you know what you perceive as our dad's failure
00:58:05.16 --> 00:58:09.80 and Vietnam I responded I don't think your dad was a failure absolutely not he prepared
00:58:09.80 --> 00:58:17.80 seal team one for war he failed in this one narrow narrow context and that context being
00:58:18.52 --> 00:58:24.36 did he advance or did he advance the naval special warfare toward you know what they ultimately
00:58:24.36 --> 00:58:29.72 became land focus commander Raiders and and that context no he didn't and another he did he was
00:58:29.72 --> 00:58:40.84 success but you know I I told him I you know even though he failed in that you know
00:58:41.80 --> 00:58:46.84 particular moment every lots of people were failing in that particular moment nobody really understood
00:58:46.84 --> 00:58:50.84 what you know what they were getting their hands into yeah it's really easy to look back
00:58:50.84 --> 00:58:54.84 with hindsight absolutely I would though obviously we should have done this instead of that it's like
00:58:54.84 --> 00:59:00.12 very easy look back and say that you know right and so I ultimately told him I was like I'm
00:59:00.12 --> 00:59:06.12 I'm proud to call him my teammate I mean I I look at his legacy and you know I I see you know
00:59:06.12 --> 00:59:13.48 mistakes that I made like I'm not perfect either nobody is so anyway so so we get the second string
00:59:13.48 --> 00:59:19.88 sailors these are the tuna fish right yeah these are the tuna fish whoa these are all guys that
00:59:19.88 --> 00:59:26.12 have gotten kind of roped into the US Navy kind of accidently like Bucklew he joins the Navy
00:59:26.12 --> 00:59:30.76 because the army and the Marine Corps won't take them because he's a human Gus I mean he's too big
00:59:30.76 --> 00:59:38.28 he tries to volunteer for the paratroopers he's too big yeah and the the quote from from his oral
00:59:38.28 --> 00:59:43.80 history is that the recruiter told him that the the army could take two instead of based on just his
00:59:43.80 --> 00:59:50.44 weight but it's completely accurate and Bucklew isn't even the biggest one big John Trips and when you
00:59:50.44 --> 00:59:54.28 see pictures of Bucklew and Trips and next to each other Trips and is a head taller than Bucklew
00:59:54.28 --> 00:59:58.60 how tall do you think Trips and was I have a six seven probably I mean he's massive he's a
00:59:58.60 --> 01:00:06.28 mountain of a man she's six seven and he's just big yeah we had this conversation over the last
01:00:06.28 --> 01:00:15.48 podcast because imagine being six seven like 260 270 in 1940 right I mean no one's even lifting
01:00:15.48 --> 01:00:20.68 bro no no these guys are just jacked through nature through football they're playing a lot of
01:00:20.68 --> 01:00:27.48 football like and Halpern who I wrote about he's the smallest one Halpern was the you know he's the
01:00:27.48 --> 01:00:33.88 Jewish guy that you know went to play for Notre Dame and I think he was like six two two twenty five
01:00:33.88 --> 01:00:38.20 something like that and he's the smallest of the smallest of the tune of the story yes well these guys
01:00:38.20 --> 01:00:45.000 end up in the navy which and they're thinking hey we're gonna figure something out because we're
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.84 jacked we're physical we're kind of beasts yeah they they pull them in to be like calisthenics yeah
01:00:50.84 --> 01:00:53.80 yeah I'm sorry that's what they get pulled they think that that's what they're gonna do they think
01:00:53.80 --> 01:00:58.04 they're you know joining to go you know do this like you know whatever commando program and they get
01:00:58.04 --> 01:01:03.48 you know roped into you know Jean Toney you know Jean Toney is you know he's a famous character
01:01:04.36 --> 01:01:15.08 himself he's the he's the two time boxing champion he beat helped me out Joe was no not Joe was
01:01:17.56 --> 01:01:23.96 this is terrible because I wrote I wrote two whole pages about Toney's fight in Philadelphia
01:01:23.96 --> 01:01:30.76 uh with um I can't think of it I know that I know that you wrote about the fact that he'd like
01:01:30.76 --> 01:01:36.52 trained he was the first person that trained yeah he's the hard guy that like that that that was going
01:01:36.52 --> 01:01:43.32 through physical training in order to get good and he was able to he only fought like three times though
01:01:44.36 --> 01:01:52.60 and two of those were championship fights jacked MC that's right so all right so now we got these guys
01:01:52.60 --> 01:01:58.84 so yeah so they they're in uh Jean Toney's regime of physical fitness instructors they're kind
01:01:58.84 --> 01:02:03.48 of getting uh they're taking navy recruits they're they're they're training them they're putting them through
01:02:04.12 --> 01:02:10.20 you know little little PT sessions like uh they're they're doing log PT's they're doing like
01:02:10.20 --> 01:02:15.08 little like group activities they stuff that you know uh either Jean Toney had pulled from the
01:02:15.08 --> 01:02:22.60 Marine Corps or uh that they had kind of uh developed along the way themselves which you know that's
01:02:22.60 --> 01:02:28.44 kind of plant a seed for later when you know the scouts and raiders uh uh conditioning curriculum
01:02:28.44 --> 01:02:35.000 gets compressed by driver coffin uh but they all volunteer for this uh this commando program they
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.04 don't really know what it is uh but then they get hoodwinked again from you know Toney's regime
01:02:40.04 --> 01:02:46.20 uh to being landing craft skippers for army commandos you know the the raider uh section of the
01:02:46.20 --> 01:02:52.28 scouts and raider program um that would piss me off so uh wouldn't it oh man they find themselves
01:02:52.28 --> 01:02:55.08 out there and they're like all right you guys are gonna be in charge of the boats
01:02:57.24 --> 01:03:01.40 I would be angry what's the character you got some guy named Weats Leban
01:03:02.84 --> 01:03:07.24 oh somebody that you caught you were taught me about his guy what's his guy uh of its lathe
01:03:07.24 --> 01:03:13.32 and so when I wrote the uh initial draft of this chapter the the thing that I felt like I had to
01:03:13.32 --> 01:03:22.68 convey was that uh uh the senior commanders in World War II they had uh they had a serious problem
01:03:22.68 --> 01:03:28.60 uh when it came to uh amphibious warfare one they didn't have landing craft uh but two
01:03:28.60 --> 01:03:33.48 even if they did have landing craft they didn't know uh the army's commanders they didn't
01:03:33.48 --> 01:03:38.76 know how to put troops ashore and there were uh there were logistics problems they they knew
01:03:38.76 --> 01:03:44.44 that they would need to even if they uh were able to land um men even if they were able to put
01:03:44.44 --> 01:03:50.12 landing craft on beaches uh they needed to put um men on beaches and which there were beach
01:03:50.12 --> 01:03:56.28 exits so exits so you could drive vehicles off the beach I mean if you land on a beach that has
01:03:56.28 --> 01:04:01.56 you know cliff faces and you can't drive off the beach then uh what good is it that you you know
01:04:01.56 --> 01:04:08.12 had all these landing craft you have to have uh guys that can find beaches good beaches uh and then
01:04:09.96 --> 01:04:15.48 alert the army out to where those beaches are so you know can bring an entire landing force
01:04:15.48 --> 01:04:22.28 ashore the army has completely um in the interwar period from World War I to World War II they've
01:04:22.28 --> 01:04:27.96 done almost nothing uh when it comes to the development of amphibious doctrine nothing showcased
01:04:27.96 --> 01:04:35.48 uh the threat of all of that more uh then uh the terrible disaster at D.A.P which happens in
01:04:35.48 --> 01:04:42.92 August of 1942 that's the first time uh the allies attempt to land um troops on an enemy beach
01:04:43.96 --> 01:04:49.24 or a Nazi controlled enemy beach now the proponents of troops in the battle are Canadians there's a
01:04:49.24 --> 01:04:56.20 decent amount of British commandos uh there's a handful of American army rainders um they go ashore
01:04:56.20 --> 01:05:02.92 uh most of the Canadians are killed or captured um and part of the reason that uh this raid or
01:05:02.92 --> 01:05:08.68 this assault or this attempted you know uh address rehearsal of D.A. fails is because they don't have
01:05:08.68 --> 01:05:14.04 a good assessment of um what the beach eggs it's were like they don't know how uh when they got
01:05:14.04 --> 01:05:20.12 ashore the tanks either um they weren't able to get off the beach because the sand was too uh
01:05:20.12 --> 01:05:24.60 too loose they couldn't their their their treads um buried up to the hubs they couldn't get out
01:05:24.60 --> 01:05:27.96 they couldn't get off the beach the tanks that or the tanks and the vehicles that were able
01:05:27.96 --> 01:05:34.60 to get off the beach they ran into tank traps almost immediately so um um the idea was you know
01:05:34.60 --> 01:05:39.16 creating you know writing this whole chapter on you know the deep raid was just you know uh
01:05:39.16 --> 01:05:46.04 away from you to talk about uh you know all the imperatives that a uh a scouting radar force would need to
01:05:46.04 --> 01:05:53.88 um um solve yeah bring to bring to the table yeah you for the for the for the mission right
01:05:53.88 --> 01:05:58.44 you needed to find a beach you know that you could land on you know the sand is dense enough uh
01:05:58.44 --> 01:06:02.04 that had beach exits uh and that you could you know signal the rest of the fleet for
01:06:04.04 --> 01:06:08.68 cut it all gone all of it's gone what's if it's labin was one of those characters he was
01:06:08.68 --> 01:06:17.08 one of the architects of uh you know Hitler's initial push to fortify um the the Atlantic wall uh
01:06:17.08 --> 01:06:21.24 I don't know why but that's labin on my nose but he was he was a character that I got sucked into
01:06:21.24 --> 01:06:26.92 because he was one of those guys that he hated Hitler uh and yet he still did everything he could
01:06:26.92 --> 01:06:32.20 to you know fortify the coast he was ultimately one of those guys that uh participated in the
01:06:32.20 --> 01:06:38.60 July 20th plot to kill Hitler and he ended up uh getting executed by dang from a meat hook um
01:06:38.60 --> 01:06:47.24 anyway that's a little bit of a rabbit hole isn't it every one of these freaking characters is like
01:06:47.24 --> 01:06:51.64 I know it's a lot I mean it's a lot but you know all these things are just you know they're
01:06:52.68 --> 01:06:58.04 there yeah what what's the what's the problem with buckloom the problem with buckloom is everywhere
01:06:58.76 --> 01:07:03.88 meaning what he's too he's moving around too much now trying to do too much what no no no he like the
01:07:03.88 --> 01:07:09.32 the the the buckloom presents a problem presented a problem for uh for a writer not for anybody
01:07:09.32 --> 01:07:16.76 else buckloom uh uh and I uh I wrote you know sections about buckloom and chapter two I wrote
01:07:16.76 --> 01:07:22.28 sections about buckloom and chapter four sections about buckloom and chapter six I mean a whole
01:07:22.28 --> 01:07:29.72 chapter about him on uh in the buckloom report and then again he he comes on the stage in uh
01:07:29.72 --> 01:07:34.76 in my chapters on Vietnam when he's the commander of naval operational support group he's everywhere he
01:07:34.76 --> 01:07:41.96 is the indispensable person in uh the history of naval special warfare what was uh the the problem
01:07:41.96 --> 01:07:47.40 that I ran into is that if I had talked about him a little bit here and I talked about him a little
01:07:47.40 --> 01:07:51.96 bit here and then a little bit there I was kind of wasting ammo on him I was going to letter I was
01:07:51.96 --> 01:08:00.52 going to you know I was going to force a reader to kind of discover uh buckloom's relevance you know
01:08:00.52 --> 01:08:06.68 instead of like compressing buckloom into that final uh chapter and you know on the buckloom report
01:08:06.68 --> 01:08:10.68 and really you know instead of you know spreading spreading out your tanks you know consoling
01:08:10.68 --> 01:08:16.52 into one punch so the reader finally gets a sense of how important this person is I just didn't
01:08:16.52 --> 01:08:21.40 want to waste buckloom you know throughout the book I wanted to you know collect him all one
01:08:21.40 --> 01:08:25.72 thing but it took me you know almost until the book was entirely written and then I had to go
01:08:25.72 --> 01:08:31.56 back through the book and I cut buckloom cut buckloom so I could you know yeah because otherwise you're
01:08:31.56 --> 01:08:36.92 kind of giving away the story because buckloom doesn't become but you know he wasn't buckloom out
01:08:36.92 --> 01:08:42.28 of the gate I mean he was a stud sure it was awesome wasn't like Phil H buckloom right which is what
01:08:42.28 --> 01:08:46.28 the where seal training takes place is called the Phil H buckloom Center for Naval Special Warfare
01:08:46.28 --> 01:08:51.000 right our schoolhouse is named after this guy but he didn't come out of the gate that way
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.16 came out of the gate as a guy and he never kind of shines in the way that other characters did so
01:08:57.16 --> 01:09:00.84 I was always frustrated because I knew that I had to talk about buckloom and I knew the buck
01:09:00.84 --> 01:09:05.96 was so important but he never you know he's not the first guy I sure like how important is he's not
01:09:07.32 --> 01:09:13.48 he's not the the ground force commander in China like how important is um but he's there he's always
01:09:13.48 --> 01:09:18.36 there like all the you know like some some other characters too so but I just didn't want to lose the
01:09:18.36 --> 01:09:24.12 was he was he younger is that why he was still around when Vietnam gets comes in the play they were
01:09:24.12 --> 01:09:28.68 all about the same age I think he was younger than helping help him was the old man of the group
01:09:28.68 --> 01:09:35.16 helping was 34 I think he used 34 when he enlisted as a semen right helping us and he was a
01:09:35.16 --> 01:09:40.04 Notre Dame graduate and NFL player and all those other crazy stuff NFL player he was running his
01:09:40.04 --> 01:09:44.84 dad's commercial light company in Chicago it was developing a clothing store I mean he was kind of like
01:09:44.84 --> 01:09:50.76 kind of the jacco like he kind of you know a lot going on and he just enlisted as a semen he was married
01:09:50.76 --> 01:09:55.56 like and he and he and he was a professional you know sailboat racer he was a competitive sailboat racer
01:09:55.56 --> 01:10:00.52 on like Michigan I don't know if you remember in the in his epitaph but I write in the book he was
01:10:01.24 --> 01:10:08.92 Halpern was he was in the 1960s Olympics for sailing a lot of bronze metal what a freaking stud yeah he's
01:10:08.92 --> 01:10:16.68 incredible and he was 34 when he had swim a semen old the 1960s he's old and the pictures of him
01:10:16.68 --> 01:10:22.20 like he was 60 years old in the Olympics he's the oldest man there was competing at that time
01:10:22.44 --> 01:10:28.44 but by then Halpern has developed I mean Halpern is you know he's more than he's got his friends
01:10:28.44 --> 01:10:35.64 with his friends with Samatra he knows everybody like he's running you know he founded LL being
01:10:35.64 --> 01:10:40.92 like he's by that point in his life I mean he's wait Buck Halpern founded LL being
01:10:40.92 --> 01:10:45.08 yeah explain that to be a little bit that's as much as I know I know he was one of the
01:10:45.08 --> 01:10:48.76 found finally I got to the end of when you rabbit holes you were you didn't have the freaking
01:10:48.76 --> 01:10:54.76 iron vault to dig in won't you tell me well maybe if you know if it wasn't for the fact that I have
01:10:54.76 --> 01:10:59.16 a factory up in Maine where we produce stuff near LL being maybe that's a little bit of a
01:10:59.16 --> 01:11:02.92 important deal we could have known a lot more about the frogman history and LL being well
01:11:02.92 --> 01:11:07.24 I'll give him some props I'll get to the bottom of that before I think he sold his shares
01:11:09.08 --> 01:11:13.56 but Buck Buck Lou and he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't quite you know outshine you know
01:11:13.56 --> 01:11:19.88 Halpern and or other other guys and all these other episodes so but he does you know like he finally
01:11:19.88 --> 01:11:25.24 takes center stage you know during the Buckley report and his whole biography is compressed into that
01:11:25.24 --> 01:11:32.60 into that report but that's getting ahead of the story all right we roll into chapter three and this was
01:11:32.60 --> 01:11:40.28 um I mean it's a rough one to read I was listening to and and re-reading and I was listening to the
01:11:40.28 --> 01:11:46.52 podcast we did on it man this is a freaking hard one to read because it's um well the name of the
01:11:46.52 --> 01:11:52.20 chapters the US Army's first commandos and the raid that wasn't so this is not a bad this one of
01:11:52.20 --> 01:11:59.24 your more abbreviated titles so so we give you credit for that uh I don't want your laughing
01:11:59.24 --> 01:12:06.84 well you know echo has no doesn't even say anything I try and keep this I try and keep it tight
01:12:06.84 --> 01:12:14.28 that's not even talking so once I mentioned it I can't unsee it like oh we shouldn't warm up it
01:12:14.28 --> 01:12:18.92 I told you he's going off here it's kind of like when Phil Vaughn said you look to you halfway
01:12:18.92 --> 01:12:22.92 through the podcast and says like what about you your name is echo you haven't said anything yet
01:12:22.92 --> 01:12:30.28 okay for echo you sure don't see much yeah there you go well's a good observant
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:38.76 situation this was a rough one because well I guess because of because of what happened with the
01:12:38.76 --> 01:12:45.88 Rangers right in the beginning what was what was it like right in this chapter um this is a
01:12:45.88 --> 01:12:52.60 this was the fifth chapter I wrote so I felt like I was I was further along I was better
01:12:52.60 --> 01:12:57.32 uh than um I was with some of the earlier chapters I don't I I don't know if that accounts for
01:12:57.88 --> 01:13:02.92 you know why I think the the chapter has such a great arc to it but I or it's just because the
01:13:03.56 --> 01:13:12.04 you know the history itself has such you know such a tragic arc um it was hard to write this in the
01:13:12.04 --> 01:13:19.40 the sense that I was I always assumed that I'd be rooting for the navy like throughout the book
01:13:19.40 --> 01:13:24.12 rooting for you know the the navy chapters and then I'd get to an army or marine court chapter and
01:13:24.12 --> 01:13:29.000 I'd be like see I told you so like I know you know I knew that you guys were going to you know
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.52 screw up and there'd be an opportunity for the navy I found the opposite to be true or not
01:13:32.52 --> 01:13:41.96 maybe not the opposite but I found myself you know just you know empathizing with these guys
01:13:41.96 --> 01:13:50.76 so much like there were I mean this the Ranger contribution um in World War II is
01:13:51.72 --> 01:14:00.52 it's remarkable the contribution of guys like Darby remarkable I mean and to have to write about
01:14:00.52 --> 01:14:09.16 Darby critically um that wasn't easy to do I had the um it was the first time that I had to
01:14:09.16 --> 01:14:15.96 write about somebody who you know I knew to be you know a legitimate American hero um and
01:14:15.96 --> 01:14:19.56 write about them you know in a you know an a light that's not flattering and I'm not sure
01:14:19.56 --> 01:14:23.48 that anybody's ever done that before I'd read a lot of books about Darby and every single one of
01:14:23.48 --> 01:14:29.08 them they you know has they burnish as legacy they they consider him you know to be one of the
01:14:30.68 --> 01:14:36.36 the the founders are one of the the the most important you know greatest
01:14:36.36 --> 01:14:42.52 um contributors to American special operation history and that's true but there's also this other truth
01:14:43.56 --> 01:14:49.72 that Darby should have known better and he didn't um and I don't know why I mean I thought
01:14:49.72 --> 01:14:55.72 I spent a lot of time thinking about it like nobody in the US Army knew better than Darby
01:14:56.20 --> 01:15:03.32 what a raid was and how a raid could be successful and what elements would have to be put together
01:15:03.32 --> 01:15:10.20 for that raid to fail and that raid I mean there's so many you know kind of warning bells about
01:15:10.20 --> 01:15:14.44 the raid on the stern of the should have alerted Darby and the rest of the chain of command that
01:15:14.44 --> 01:15:18.60 this was this was a disaster waiting to happen and yet you know nobody threw the brakes on
01:15:19.48 --> 01:15:24.04 this is one of the ones where you do a little psychological kind of profiling of Darby
01:15:24.76 --> 01:15:29.24 I actually want wanted to read this section part of it I read on the last one but it's worth reading again
01:15:29.24 --> 01:15:35.40 um because part of it I didn't read on the last one black hair blue-eyed wide mouth as a duck
01:15:35.72 --> 01:15:41.08 Darby had a ruddy face divided into equal parts forehead and chin
01:15:42.20 --> 01:15:48.68 his left cheek borham mysterious brilliant red scar not particularly muscular he nevertheless
01:15:48.68 --> 01:15:55.24 affected chest out shoulders back posture in which his arms always seemed cocked to the rear as if
01:15:55.24 --> 01:15:59.88 never more than a moment away from snapping to attention son of a printer in a musician
01:15:59.88 --> 01:16:05.64 the second child between two sisters he grew up scouting the Arkansas woods and playing the
01:16:05.64 --> 01:16:10.84 saxophone when in high school his older sister died in Texas he married then divorced in spite of
01:16:10.84 --> 01:16:16.20 disappointment and tragedy his attitude remained just as ever been good humor and irresponsible
01:16:16.20 --> 01:16:21.88 or sorry in irrepressible in personality just like in posture he was direct forceful and never
01:16:21.88 --> 01:16:28.84 vacillating had the military gene not dominated and driven him to a life of soldiering he would have been
01:16:28.84 --> 01:16:36.28 been a salesman he is the ideal commando leader wrote Colonel Vaughan at the end of the course
01:16:36.28 --> 01:16:42.04 he possesses the energy keenness and personality which produces the best out of those under his command
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:49.40 graduated from west point in 1933 at the apex of the bell curve ranked 177 out of a class of
01:16:49.40 --> 01:16:56.60 346 he was originally assigned as a field artillery officer like all soldiers who graduated then
01:16:56.60 --> 01:17:01.48 and with that assignment he embarked on an eight-year career punctuated by the peace time artillery
01:17:01.48 --> 01:17:07.40 corps's elements boredom and horse manure the 1941 he was one of the few soldiers who attended the
01:17:07.40 --> 01:17:14.60 joint army marine corps amphibious exercises in Puerto Rico disappointed at not snagging a combat command
01:17:14.60 --> 01:17:20.68 in the wake of the pearl harbour attacks in mid-January 1942 he was made assistant to major general
01:17:20.68 --> 01:17:27.08 Russell P. Hardle commander of the 34th infantry and assigned to northern island the staging
01:17:27.08 --> 01:17:32.60 area for a theater of operation still two years in the future anxious to get into the war when
01:17:32.60 --> 01:17:39.88 assigned to escort general trust got on his base tour and Ranger recruitment drive Darby made the most of it
01:17:39.88 --> 01:17:45.72 trust got duly rewarded Darby's professionalism and interest with an offer to command the first
01:17:45.72 --> 01:17:51.40 Ranger battalion few offers have been accepted so enthusiastically at first glance Darby's
01:17:51.40 --> 01:17:58.92 Rangers viewed him as a pencil pushing a decamp and why not he was after all little more than a
01:17:58.92 --> 01:18:05.08 peace time artillery officer not even an infantryman this perception died a quick death
01:18:05.08 --> 01:18:12.60 throughout their training Darby slung a standard M1 overs shoulder and rotated between companies
01:18:12.60 --> 01:18:17.72 marching climbing shooting doing whatever the men were doing and doing it better after an
01:18:17.72 --> 01:18:23.32 intelligence officer from headquarters brief the Rangers on the allied procedures for surrendering to the
01:18:23.32 --> 01:18:28.92 enemy Darby bristled and took the floor this formation this information you have just heard is
01:18:28.92 --> 01:18:33.32 all very well for those troops who are going to be captured but that is not for Rangers
01:18:33.32 --> 01:18:41.08 if there's any capturing to be done he continued it is the Rangers who will do it within two months
01:18:41.08 --> 01:18:48.68 of training together the men were reverently calling him Eldarbo by the end he would defy comparison
01:18:48.68 --> 01:18:55.88 and army staff officer waiting ashore at Sorrento in 1943 and 1943 would find a man wearing a
01:18:55.88 --> 01:19:01.48 Ranger patch and ask where he might find Darby smirking the Ranger would reply you'll never find him
01:19:01.48 --> 01:19:10.20 this far back if the ideal army officer was equal parts confidence bravery energy and obedience
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:19.56 Darby was all these things but perhaps too much the last and that that sent and stuck with me
01:19:20.84 --> 01:19:26.28 you know from a leadership perspective of course because it's about balance right and you do
01:19:26.28 --> 01:19:34.44 need to be obedient but at the same time if you're too obedient you're yeah there's a
01:19:34.44 --> 01:19:40.92 you're too obedient right there's a famous quote by one of Frederick the Great's generals
01:19:40.92 --> 01:19:49.56 he says to a young officer the king gave you a commission so you because he assumed what
01:19:49.56 --> 01:19:57.40 that you would know when to break orders and that's all part of initiative I mean that's all like
01:19:59.24 --> 01:20:04.52 if there was one trait that I sort of settled on as being the reason that the
01:20:06.52 --> 01:20:13.56 the Navy seemed to be ahead of the game where at least a ahead of its peers when it came to
01:20:13.56 --> 01:20:18.68 the creation of special operations units it was because the Navy had this culture of latitude
01:20:18.68 --> 01:20:28.20 and this decentralized command and an initiative that enabled subordinates to feel like they had
01:20:28.20 --> 01:20:35.80 the flexibility to make decisions on the fly or adjust to the realities that they were facing
01:20:35.80 --> 01:20:46.60 whereas somebody like Darby is in the US Army and one thing that I wrote is you know the
01:20:46.60 --> 01:20:55.32 chain of command in the US Army has never been it's never been de-linked it's only been
01:20:55.32 --> 01:21:01.48 progressively thick and over time and you see that not just in not just today but you can kind of
01:21:01.48 --> 01:21:06.12 see it happen gradually and I would see it you know a little bit in World War II and I kind of got
01:21:06.12 --> 01:21:12.28 that my first sense of it here reading and writing about the Rangers but I also saw it you know
01:21:12.28 --> 01:21:18.92 in my Korean War chapters and I would come across you know an army general like Edwin Walker who
01:21:18.92 --> 01:21:25.88 he's flying above his troops above his soldiers in a little spotter plane with a bullhorn
01:21:25.88 --> 01:21:33.16 telling individual units which one you know which one to move like I mean in some sense that you know
01:21:33.16 --> 01:21:38.76 that says to you the reader you know what a cool what a cool general that he's you know willing to
01:21:38.76 --> 01:21:42.84 you know put himself out there for the same time like that's also like awful that's taking
01:21:42.84 --> 01:21:47.72 all the initiative away from your guys and you're you know you're you're not only telling them
01:21:47.72 --> 01:21:51.96 where they should advance but you're also telling them that they don't have the authority to
01:21:51.96 --> 01:21:56.60 to retreat either if they need to or to you know gain a tactical advantage by maneuver
01:21:56.60 --> 01:22:02.04 centralized command that it's worse right there absolutely and the last time we we you were
01:22:02.04 --> 01:22:07.000 on we talked about the fact that hey when you're in the navy you know throughout history and you
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:13.56 know if bends in charge of this ship you're gonna go sail away from me as the Admiral I can't talk
01:22:13.56 --> 01:22:17.64 to anyone like you're you you've got the mission you're gonna do it to the best of your ability
01:22:17.64 --> 01:22:25.80 the other thing that's interesting about this is sometimes the ocean is going to dictate what
01:22:25.80 --> 01:22:31.40 you're going to like it out there are certain times where you cannot you cannot proceed you cannot
01:22:31.40 --> 01:22:37.56 continue the ocean is going to stop you you know you can get some really really extreme examples
01:22:37.56 --> 01:22:43.24 where weather could inhibit you on land from making the type of progress you want to make but you
01:22:43.24 --> 01:22:49.72 right a river swollen right a river swollen but those are extreme examples right the out in the
01:22:49.72 --> 01:22:56.20 ocean that's kind of a regular thing you know there's giant sea states that come through it's it's
01:22:56.20 --> 01:23:02.92 so so you have to have some more ability to adapt because you are look if you're in a sailboat
01:23:03.64 --> 01:23:09.40 the wind's not blowing you're not going anywhere right that's what's happening you can't maneuver
01:23:09.40 --> 01:23:13.16 to the north because the direction of the wind or the direction of the sea state you can't do it's
01:23:13.16 --> 01:23:19.56 not going to happen so you have to have some level of flexibility whereas more so on the ground
01:23:19.56 --> 01:23:26.12 you can power through a lot of weather events and again I'm going back to you know times before
01:23:26.12 --> 01:23:34.68 radios and before before motors where you're just going to make this happen so it seems like yeah
01:23:34.68 --> 01:23:41.56 unfortunately that Darby was a little heavy on the obedience and it's not always a positive thing
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:49.64 no I mean I'm not just on not just on obedience but on
01:23:49.64 --> 01:23:56.28 on paragatives that's not that's not the right word either but protocol I would say so he gets
01:23:56.92 --> 01:24:03.16 one of the one of the the shocking things that I saw when he was putting the the sister in a
01:24:03.16 --> 01:24:09.64 raid together was he put in charge of the entire assault element a an officer who'd never been
01:24:09.64 --> 01:24:15.48 with the Rangers who would just because he was in the rank yeah just because he he had a date of rank
01:24:15.48 --> 01:24:22.76 you know the proceeded you know the the Rangers that he'd been working with since they'd been
01:24:22.76 --> 01:24:27.72 training together in Scotland these were Rangers that knew what being a Ranger was they these
01:24:27.72 --> 01:24:32.68 guys have been trained by the British Commandos they knew what a raid was they knew the you know
01:24:32.68 --> 01:24:37.48 how a raid would succeed and how it would fail and what then the and instead of you know putting
01:24:37.48 --> 01:24:43.88 one of his you know one of his Rangers that he knew from Scotland in charge he selected the guy
01:24:43.88 --> 01:24:49.24 who'd never been a Ranger not and he's not a bad leader he's an excellent leader and he
01:24:49.24 --> 01:24:55.96 equates himself you know incredibly during the battle but he also doesn't know as as Daylights
01:24:56.52 --> 01:25:03.16 creeping up on these guys and they have a sense of we are in the middle of a German division
01:25:04.20 --> 01:25:09.000 there is we can't do this we can't accomplish this he does not have the confidence to say
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:18.28 guys we're turning around and so um speaking of British Commandos I know one of the one of the
01:25:18.28 --> 01:25:27.80 people that you had to kind of cut was Mount Baton yeah Lord Lewis Mount Baton this dude is like
01:25:27.80 --> 01:25:34.28 the British of all British right he he is but he's not like the one thing that I thought was
01:25:34.28 --> 01:25:41.48 interesting about Mount Baton is their Germans the Mount Baton family their their Germans his
01:25:41.48 --> 01:25:47.64 his father believe it's his father he becomes the first Lord of the Admiralty but he's born in
01:25:47.64 --> 01:25:55.96 Germany he serves in the German Navy he doesn't emigrate to England or to the United Kingdom until
01:25:55.96 --> 01:26:00.28 he's a bit older and then he rises up through the ranks of the British Navy becomes the first Lord
01:26:00.28 --> 01:26:07.96 but Mount Baton so Prince Philip Prince Philip who just passed away he was a Mount Baton so Lord
01:26:07.96 --> 01:26:17.56 Louis Mount Baton was his uncle yeah so Mount Baton means a fascinating character he's he by the time
01:26:17.56 --> 01:26:23.32 he's put in charge of combined operations headquarters of the the entity that commands all
01:26:23.32 --> 01:26:28.92 British Commandos he's been I think he's been shot out from under two ships or he's had two ships
01:26:28.92 --> 01:26:36.20 that were sunk you know we you that's a second time you've made that statement about hey this
01:26:36.20 --> 01:26:43.16 guy had two ships shot out from under him and it sounds really cool right now right yeah like damn you
01:26:43.16 --> 01:26:48.44 know because we're like you know we think that's kind of cool but I wonder if there's any negative
01:26:48.44 --> 01:26:54.36 where someone's like dude this guy's laws two ships row one's raw with you yeah I wonder I
01:26:54.36 --> 01:26:59.000 don't think about oh he kept getting promoted yeah we had the political connection he's he's really
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:05.88 young he's really dynamic he's one of the few people that is able to not dominate Churchill but
01:27:05.88 --> 01:27:12.68 he's able to like Churchill thinks he's just I mean he's this cavalier and so he's the one that
01:27:12.68 --> 01:27:19.32 grew up in Germany that's his dad that's his dad yeah so Louis Mount Baton he grows up he's his
01:27:19.32 --> 01:27:25.88 British it's a I don't know he's British he's British and he seems to have like all the
01:27:25.88 --> 01:27:35.72 stereotypical kind of British personality absolutely yeah he's he he's he he's he's he's he's
01:27:37.08 --> 01:27:42.60 I mean he's he's playing polo and writing books and polo and stuff like this I mean this is it man
01:27:42.60 --> 01:27:48.04 he's hanging out with a king and queen he's got a cigarette holder I mean he's he's British he's the
01:27:48.04 --> 01:27:55.96 quintessential British but the commandos themselves who we who we kind of who we throw in with the
01:27:55.96 --> 01:28:01.32 sort of who who played the biggest role in in creating the creating the British commandos is that
01:28:01.32 --> 01:28:06.28 is that Clark oh yeah Dudley Clark he's the guy who initially comes up with the idea he's another
01:28:06.28 --> 01:28:13.40 weirdo really fun to learn about really fun to write he's he was a he was a British army officer
01:28:13.40 --> 01:28:24.28 he'd grown up I believe in Palestine he had seen me not only he had seen British Raiders during
01:28:24.28 --> 01:28:29.96 the first World War it kind of experienced what some of that was like I think he he was friendly
01:28:29.96 --> 01:28:40.76 with Ward Wingate he was a oh yeah one of the one of the things one of the ways that he got the
01:28:40.76 --> 01:28:44.92 idea for British commandos was he was in fact you would with an Napoleonic War history and
01:28:44.92 --> 01:28:51.72 in fact it was a real student of Wellington's Peninsula Wars and all of the partisans that
01:28:51.72 --> 01:29:01.08 Wellington had hired and and sent against the French forces so he when after the disaster at
01:29:01.08 --> 01:29:07.16 Dunkirk you know Dudley Clark who's a bit you know bit of an oddball in the military
01:29:07.16 --> 01:29:15.16 hierarchy I think his hobby is he's a he's an amateur actor but he puts a little paper together
01:29:15.16 --> 01:29:21.72 and he sends it up to Churchill and it's the paper is essentially create special troops
01:29:22.44 --> 01:29:30.28 that are capable at sea and send them on all of these little raids against the the coastline
01:29:30.28 --> 01:29:34.04 spread out German defenses not you know to similar from what the Navy was trying to do in the central
01:29:34.04 --> 01:29:44.28 Pacific Churchill is the he Churchill's you know completely infatuated with any idea that
01:29:44.28 --> 01:29:51.56 his generals do not like this is one of them he he thinks this is a the great idea not just because
01:29:51.56 --> 01:29:55.40 you know this is going to spread German defenses out but you know more importantly than that it's
01:29:55.40 --> 01:30:01.24 going to energize the British people the British people have just suffered this terrible you know
01:30:01.24 --> 01:30:10.20 the feet at Dunkirk they need a win they need a series of wins so yeah he agrees to it he
01:30:10.20 --> 01:30:19.56 is pushes the entire British establishment to create these commandos what he does not expect
01:30:19.56 --> 01:30:26.20 and what his general stone expect as that these raids start being successful so successful that
01:30:26.20 --> 01:30:35.000 they they want to develop more of them and so the by by the end of or by 1942 there's not
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.68 just British commandos at this point there's Canadian commandos it's French commandos and they're all
01:30:38.68 --> 01:30:46.04 sort of operating under this the COHQ I have you ever read the book Rogue Heroes it's a book about
01:30:46.04 --> 01:30:54.28 the British SAS North Africa it follows them all through the war but point if you want a book that is
01:30:54.28 --> 01:31:01.08 kind of outside of you know the American special operations experience that is that's the one
01:31:01.80 --> 01:31:09.16 it's it's interesting because you know it's even I would say it's the the SAS experience the SAS
01:31:09.16 --> 01:31:19.48 and the SBS experience during World War II establishes a type of commando that we're not familiar with
01:31:19.48 --> 01:31:25.40 like and it establishes a legacy of expectations that you know we don't really have like our
01:31:25.40 --> 01:31:31.24 we have sort of a no fail expectations on our commando operations the SAS the SBS they were
01:31:31.24 --> 01:31:38.84 willing to just try stuff and if they lost an entire team well that's the price of doing business I mean
01:31:38.84 --> 01:31:44.52 and I think they kind of carry that cavalierness through today like I think I mean if you've ever
01:31:44.52 --> 01:31:50.20 worked with SAS or SBS I'm sure you have I mean I don't know if you noticed that and then I certainly
01:31:50.20 --> 01:31:56.12 noticed that when we worked with the SBS these guys are you know maybe not as I wouldn't say
01:31:56.12 --> 01:32:01.08 they're not they're less well trained but they are willing to they they have an expectation of risk
01:32:02.92 --> 01:32:07.88 that I was not familiar with and I think they pulled that directly from this experience in World War II
01:32:07.88 --> 01:32:16.84 so check what else was it that made Dudley-Curt Clark an odd ball I mean the dudes in actor
01:32:16.84 --> 01:32:19.80 and we know Ecos and a bit of an actor I don't think he's odd
01:32:22.44 --> 01:32:27.08 was there some other was there some other thing that dragged you into this or that you
01:32:27.08 --> 01:32:31.000 started getting the feeling this guy's a little strange yeah he leads the first commando raid
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:38.60 and it's a completely I mean so he has this idea you know not much different than Carlson
01:32:38.60 --> 01:32:43.24 you know to come up with these you know commandos but and I like Carlson he leads one of the first
01:32:43.24 --> 01:32:50.12 raids and like Carlson he's completely unsuited to do it I mean he's not an operational commander he's
01:32:50.12 --> 01:32:55.48 the thinker I think he kind of he suspects that but he's willing to you know put himself on the line to
01:32:55.48 --> 01:33:03.16 prove you know his his idea he ends up going through the war and coming up with he hands up being
01:33:05.40 --> 01:33:12.44 a really capable spy not spy master but like deception officer he's able to convince the
01:33:12.44 --> 01:33:17.72 Germans that you know different points during the war that we're about to attack and in this in this
01:33:17.72 --> 01:33:23.08 spot which forces the Germans to move troops to an area but he leads that first commando raid
01:33:23.08 --> 01:33:29.88 um and they don't really raid anything I think they stumble across to German bicyclists
01:33:29.88 --> 01:33:35.08 they kill both of them they forget to search them they don't know what they were even guarding
01:33:35.08 --> 01:33:41.24 and then on his on his particular raid they one of the one of the guys accidentally
01:33:41.24 --> 01:33:47.40 uh checks a magazine onto a beach right when there's an approaching German patrol the Germans
01:33:47.40 --> 01:33:52.04 counter ambush them and they have to race into the the water to get back to their boats
01:33:52.04 --> 01:33:56.44 when they get back to their boats deadly clock realizes that his year has been almost been shot off
01:33:56.44 --> 01:34:01.64 and a sailor has to stitch it back in place for the transit back to uh uh back to England
01:34:03.64 --> 01:34:09.32 damn yeah getting that year stitched back on by a by a little by a pedi off
01:34:09.32 --> 01:34:14.76 even like in like a freaking zodiac or something yeah and the mission is so badly planned when they get
01:34:14.76 --> 01:34:19.64 when they finally get back uh to the coast back to they they they didn't have any decontriction
01:34:19.64 --> 01:34:25.000 they get stopped by British uh shore but patrol boats uh thinking that they're a German boat
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.92 you know trying to send uh raiders ashore um and when the and when the um uh the coast guard comes
01:34:30.92 --> 01:34:37.08 aboard their their vessel uh all the British commandos are drunk so not only they get shot off the
01:34:37.08 --> 01:34:44.84 beach they drank the entire boats like or supply there you go how about the devil's brigade how
01:34:44.84 --> 01:34:50.92 was that played to this uh whole scene the devil's brigade or um they were just one they were one of
01:34:50.92 --> 01:34:56.36 those uh units that I was really interested in and I really I was almost trying like looking for
01:34:56.36 --> 01:35:03.72 an excuse to to write about them they were um they were a unit that uh was a it was a joint um
01:35:03.72 --> 01:35:10.28 uh Canadian and American uh unit and it was the kind of the brainchild of Mount Baton um Marshall
01:35:10.28 --> 01:35:16.20 had by and uh it was supposed to be a unit that they dropped into Norway on uh like snowmobiles or
01:35:16.20 --> 01:35:23.24 our snow tractors um that would lead raids and ultimately became a pretty adequate um uh
01:35:23.24 --> 01:35:29.72 semi-commando force uh it was an air sort of sort of sort of ranger sort of airborne um and Robert
01:35:29.72 --> 01:35:37.88 Frederick's uh became the commander of it and he was uh as um as interesting as Darby uh you know this um
01:35:37.88 --> 01:35:45.08 uh had you know as equally a story uh career I think he was uh wounded something like nine times uh
01:35:45.08 --> 01:35:51.64 during the course of the war um uh and what was the how come the devil's brigade didn't
01:35:52.52 --> 01:36:00.44 sustain well I mean the army special forces when they are um when they are claiming uh their
01:36:01.48 --> 01:36:05.56 their forefathers they always point to the devil's brigade and I don't really I don't really see a
01:36:05.56 --> 01:36:11.88 connection between uh army special forces and the devil's brigade's getting it in here except
01:36:11.88 --> 01:36:16.84 for the fact that these guys are in the army well they're in the army and they're and they're airborne
01:36:16.84 --> 01:36:22.12 qualified so but they're not leading partisans or anything like that they're shock troops um
01:36:22.12 --> 01:36:25.64 they're more like rangers then they're more like rangers but just like marils marauders
01:36:25.64 --> 01:36:29.96 marils marauders or you know when I set out to write a chapter on the rangers and to talk about
01:36:30.36 --> 01:36:35.40 how the rangers opened a gap for the navy to fill I didn't think that I'd be covering
01:36:35.40 --> 01:36:39.16 Darby other people who had covered Darby before and I was like I kind of want to avoid that I'd
01:36:39.16 --> 01:36:45.24 I'd rather focus on you know a a a ranger legacy that hasn't you know that's less well known and
01:36:45.24 --> 01:36:51.08 my idea initially was to cover the 5307 which is marils marauders in Burma I really wanted to
01:36:52.68 --> 01:36:58.28 instead of sustain a cover the the battle of Mijkina which is an isolated hilltop in Burma
01:36:58.28 --> 01:37:02.28 that the marils marauders sees and there's some you know pretty interesting characters in
01:37:02.28 --> 01:37:08.20 maril he's a he's another odd ball I think he by that point in the war he's been removed because
01:37:08.20 --> 01:37:13.56 he's already had two heart attacks in Burma he stayed in the field no was another excuse for
01:37:13.56 --> 01:37:17.88 you know to talk about still well so was another character that I always you know kind of had a
01:37:17.88 --> 01:37:23.32 soft spot in my heart for but they just didn't fit because you know the reason that I had to cover
01:37:23.32 --> 01:37:27.88 her sister and the reason that that I had to talk about sister and as opposed to point to hawk or
01:37:27.88 --> 01:37:35.000 Mijkina or another one of these really important ranger battles is because sisterina is the one
01:37:35.56 --> 01:37:43.16 that leaves its impression on the army hierarchy on the chain of command even when you have
01:37:43.16 --> 01:37:48.44 a success as incredible as point to hawk even when you have a success as incredible as Kabanatawan
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.88 and the rescue of all those POWs it doesn't leave its legacy or it doesn't leave an impression on
01:37:53.88 --> 01:37:59.96 the army chain of command like sisterna does so sterna clouds an entire generation of hostility
01:38:01.16 --> 01:38:07.40 of regular conventional army leaders to the concept of elite commandos if that makes sense
01:38:08.52 --> 01:38:13.80 yeah that's definitely that that section of the book I'm again I read it on the last the last time
01:38:13.80 --> 01:38:19.88 we were together on this podcast it's just it's it's it's it's very different it's
01:38:19.88 --> 01:38:25.72 tough to difficult even read and and what's incredible about it is it's it's the notes from the
01:38:25.72 --> 01:38:32.84 radial room these are these are transcripts of what was actually said between Derby and his front
01:38:32.84 --> 01:38:38.84 line leadership who are being overrun and slaughtered and you can you can read exactly what they were
01:38:38.84 --> 01:38:44.04 saying to each other it's yeah another just incredible a lot of the a lot of that's taken from
01:38:45.24 --> 01:38:49.80 you know like like you said the transcripts which I that's one of the few times that I was at an archive
01:38:49.80 --> 01:38:54.92 going through it going through a document and not just you know quickly taking a photo and moving on
01:38:54.92 --> 01:38:59.96 that was one of those times where I was like I was trying I mean I knew what happened and I'm
01:39:00.84 --> 01:39:07.24 I was reading it like it was a novel like and I was you know tensing up like knowing what each page
01:39:07.24 --> 01:39:13.000 that each page was gonna get worse and worse and worse and then I was I was watching this unfold in
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:18.60 an archive you know eight years after the fact but it was you know it was every bit is real to me
01:39:18.60 --> 01:39:23.72 well maybe not every bit is real but you know you're these are you know fellow fellow Americans
01:39:23.72 --> 01:39:28.68 you know doing the absolute best they could for their country for each other and you know the guy
01:39:28.68 --> 01:39:33.64 on the other end of the radio was watching his friends die around him and then before we move
01:39:33.64 --> 01:39:41.000 your chapter for what about what about Charles Shunstrom what's that guy's deal he got cut completely
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:48.12 out of the book is that right yes sort of I mean he got so he he's responsible for writing the
01:39:48.12 --> 01:39:57.24 Shunstrom report which is the it was there's a report written only well if I do the math
01:39:57.24 --> 01:40:03.48 right probably a month after sisterna so he's one of he's one of the guys that was captured
01:40:04.12 --> 01:40:10.52 in the in the final moments of the the raid he was he had been with Darby all the way through
01:40:11.56 --> 01:40:16.84 the the the rangers experience so he'd been one of the handful of rangers trained
01:40:16.84 --> 01:40:22.12 by the British commandos in actin of carry Scott Scotland fought through north Africa fought
01:40:22.12 --> 01:40:29.16 through Sicily fought through Italy the winter line then he's one of the officers captured he's
01:40:29.16 --> 01:40:35.56 won he's the officer who's driving Darby in jaila when Darby is in the back with a 50 cow
01:40:35.56 --> 01:40:41.64 or with the the recoil is rifle and destroys the Italian tank that turns Darby from Darby into Darby the
01:40:41.64 --> 01:40:51.48 legend so he's with Darby throughout you know the everything he's he's as you know he's as
01:40:51.48 --> 01:41:00.36 incredible or as anyway he he's captured at sisterna escapes two weeks later
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:09.64 makes it back to friendly lines and from from his escape he's able to write the report of what
01:41:09.64 --> 01:41:14.60 actually happened he's one of the few guys that got out and he drafts this I can't remember
01:41:14.60 --> 01:41:21.96 the ten page report so a lot of what's in those final pages is drawn from the shunström report
01:41:21.96 --> 01:41:29.08 now he has a really tragic end to his life he I can't remember how he passes away I think he's dead
01:41:29.08 --> 01:41:36.20 with in ten years though of of this event he after World War II he I think he goes to Southern
01:41:36.20 --> 01:41:41.40 California he tries to be an actor doesn't work out and then he you know turns to drink
01:41:42.04 --> 01:41:46.92 and a series of bad decisions please to a series of worst decisions and I think he starts robbing
01:41:46.92 --> 01:41:53.88 banks he's one of those guys that you know he just isn't able to reintegrate into society he
01:41:53.88 --> 01:41:59.72 had been a ranger officer one of the you know guys in charge and here he is he's not able to you know
01:41:59.72 --> 01:42:08.04 um uh reintegrate into you know polite society and ultimately I can't remember how he dies but I
01:42:08.04 --> 01:42:16.44 think that some combination of alcohol and um yeah some combination of alcohol robbing banks guns
01:42:16.44 --> 01:42:25.88 just get after it you know this you know this it's pretty good you got to kind of ask yourself
01:42:25.88 --> 01:42:32.12 and I had a conversation with someone the other day about you know that just like modern times and
01:42:32.12 --> 01:42:42.52 all this who's gonna fight the worse yeah right who is going to put freaking black paint on their
01:42:42.52 --> 01:42:51.32 face and pick up a weapon and crawl across the beach and start killing enemy like that's a
01:42:51.32 --> 01:42:57.24 certain type of human being right that's the type of human being that may not correctly reintegrate
01:42:57.24 --> 01:43:03.40 into society this dude might end up robbing banks when he gets back let's it's the Martin Watson
01:43:03.40 --> 01:43:10.04 problem yeah it's the Martin Watson problem which we'll get to but but we do have to think about that and
01:43:11.88 --> 01:43:18.36 when you have guys you know we we talked about obedience as a characteristic being look it's it's
01:43:18.36 --> 01:43:24.12 good to have some obedience yes it is and was Darby maybe too far on a spectrum of being too obedient
01:43:24.12 --> 01:43:27.56 yes but then you get some other guys that are on the other end of the spectrum that's you want
01:43:27.56 --> 01:43:30.52 you want to have someone that's gonna be the handle care what you tell me to do I'm gonna go
01:43:30.52 --> 01:43:36.04 attack this machine gun nest get out of my way you want to have some guys like that now hard to control
01:43:36.92 --> 01:43:41.88 but if you get rid of these guys you get rid of the Charles Chunchrums and the Watson's you get rid of
01:43:41.88 --> 01:43:47.24 those guys your military's not going to be able to function in my opinion that's not gonna be able to win
01:43:47.24 --> 01:43:51.08 I said okay yep you're right it's not it's gonna be able to function probably going to be able to function very
01:43:51.08 --> 01:43:57.56 effectively in a peace time environment so my question you commanded these guys how how I mean what
01:43:57.56 --> 01:44:03.000 what's the answer how do you how do you you know take the strengths of a of a chunchrum or a Watson
01:44:04.20 --> 01:44:08.76 but how do you make sure that they don't go off the rails yeah you what you have to do is you have to put put the
01:44:09.32 --> 01:44:14.36 put the guard rails in place and you have to and it's not here's the the interesting thing about this
01:44:14.36 --> 01:44:21.08 isn't that hard this isn't where you've got to be costly monitoring every single thing that they do
01:44:21.08 --> 01:44:25.64 you have a good relationship with your guys then when you say hey listen here's the line we're not
01:44:25.64 --> 01:44:30.60 crossing it guys go yep Roger that and they know you're not playing around the you haven't
01:44:31.96 --> 01:44:38.44 you haven't uh uh shown them where hey you know jockel says this but he doesn't really mean that no it's
01:44:38.44 --> 01:44:42.68 like when I say something this is what I mean and this is what we're gonna do this is what we're not gonna
01:44:42.68 --> 01:44:50.92 do and and look I mean I had guys that were definitely actually I want to have guys just like I just
01:44:50.92 --> 01:44:55.72 said I want to have guys they were saying hey if I can get if I get the chance to do this in a high
01:44:55.72 --> 01:44:59.64 progressive way I'm gonna do it you you may chance to kill the enemy I'm gonna do it that's what I'm
01:44:59.64 --> 01:45:03.24 here for that's why that's why I was born dude I told you Friday you know Tony a Friday
01:45:04.36 --> 01:45:11.40 Tony was uh Patoon Chief in Charlie Patoon task in a bruiser if he would do anything to be able to
01:45:11.40 --> 01:45:15.96 go out and kill the enemy and he would also never cross the line of like oh okay hey we're not doing
01:45:15.96 --> 01:45:22.52 that cool that's what that's the line and that's exactly what you want um and and what so so
01:45:22.52 --> 01:45:27.000 the question that you posed to me how do you do it what you do is you have a good relationship with
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:32.92 the guys you explained to them what we can do what we can't do and then you explain why we can't do it
01:45:33.88 --> 01:45:39.80 and there was um uh I used to go and brief the jockey classes the the junior officer training classes
01:45:39.80 --> 01:45:46.68 and and briefed mine okay well there you go one of the things that I used to tell these guys was hey
01:45:46.68 --> 01:45:52.68 listen when it comes to when it comes to the rules of engagement when it comes to the law of
01:45:52.68 --> 01:45:59.24 arm conflict you have to not just do what you think is right you have to do what you think it what
01:45:59.24 --> 01:46:04.04 you have to do not just what is you think is right but what is legal and here's the reason
01:46:04.04 --> 01:46:08.52 and and Lave had to have this conversation Lave had a senior officer in the room when I was
01:46:08.52 --> 01:46:18.04 explaining this to these young guys like yourself that what's what people think is right what you
01:46:18.04 --> 01:46:24.92 you take 16 seals and you say you give them a case example of is this right in your own personal
01:46:24.92 --> 01:46:30.76 moral code you're gonna get 16 different answers you're gonna get so as I said oh yeah this this
01:46:30.76 --> 01:46:36.12 this person's uh in surgeon we'll kill him or this person's in surgeon oh well we shouldn't
01:46:36.12 --> 01:46:39.88 hurt him because we can reform them you can have all these kind of wild different answers
01:46:41.24 --> 01:46:47.08 so what you the only thing you can actually follow isn't what an individual quote thinks is right
01:46:48.04 --> 01:46:54.04 you have to follow what is actually legal and I made that I always made that very clear with my
01:46:54.04 --> 01:46:59.56 guys hey listen this is what you can do this is what you cannot do and here's a why and of course
01:46:59.56 --> 01:47:03.72 in any leadership situation it's important to explain the why and you know for instance in
01:47:03.72 --> 01:47:10.76 Romadi there was a bunch of reasons why you can't go out and shoot an innocent person well first of
01:47:10.76 --> 01:47:15.64 all yeah it's morally wrong second of all everyone would know about her immediately so it's not like
01:47:15.64 --> 01:47:19.000 it's not like I could have a sniper going oh you know I'll sneak in a shot over here and no
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:25.40 it's gonna know no we're in a city with 400,000 Iraqi civilians that we there's a mayor there's a police
01:47:25.40 --> 01:47:30.44 force there's a there's a governor there's a whole there's teachers and doctors inside that city
01:47:30.44 --> 01:47:36.92 you kill an innocent civilian everybody's gonna know about it and by the way all those Iraqi
01:47:36.92 --> 01:47:40.84 government officials they have relationships with the brigade commanders with the battalion
01:47:40.84 --> 01:47:46.12 commanders with the company commanders we're all talking so if you think oh I'm gonna shoot
01:47:46.12 --> 01:47:50.04 some innocent person get aware that you're never gonna get away with it's not happening and
01:47:51.32 --> 01:47:57.32 on top of that we are now losing the war when you go out and kill an innocent civilian you're giving
01:47:57.32 --> 01:48:05.88 you're giving propaganda to the enemy and you're creating more insurgents by killing an innocent
01:48:05.88 --> 01:48:12.04 person so you have to not just explain hey legally you can't do this but it also here's why you can't do it
01:48:14.44 --> 01:48:21.40 I was speaking to a group of army leaders one time and I said hey in any in any
01:48:21.40 --> 01:48:25.16 platoon you're gonna have a sociopath in there you have somebody that's you give them the opportunity
01:48:25.16 --> 01:48:30.68 to kill or maybe even you don't they they might take advantage of that they're gonna look for an
01:48:30.68 --> 01:48:33.48 opportunity to kill they're gonna look for an opportunity to torture someone they're gonna look for an
01:48:33.48 --> 01:48:39.88 opportunity to rape a woman like you take a platoon you're gonna have that in there and I got some
01:48:39.88 --> 01:48:45.80 looks from the crowd kind of like oh that's not that's not realistic and and no kidding two weeks later
01:48:45.80 --> 01:48:51.32 I was doing a podcast with Jordan Peterson and before we started recording I said hey let me
01:48:51.32 --> 01:48:55.48 ask you a question here's what I told this group of army guys I said in your platoon you're gonna
01:48:55.48 --> 01:49:00.44 have at least one person that's a sociopath is that an accurate statement and he's just how many
01:49:00.44 --> 01:49:07.96 people in a platoon well in a platoon 40 50 and he goes oh you know and I won't try and imitate
01:49:07.96 --> 01:49:13.48 your footage but you know he basically oh yeah definitely and and then he said because it's like one
01:49:13.48 --> 01:49:21.000 in a hundred in normal society that you have a sociopath but the the army or the Marine Corps
01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:28.44 is not normal society you've already screamed out a bunch of people that are definitely not sociopaths
01:49:28.84 --> 01:49:35.88 and so to have you probably actually have two or three sociopaths inside your platoon and
01:49:35.88 --> 01:49:41.88 and then look you also get some guys that just you know like like shun shun shun
01:49:41.88 --> 01:49:47.16 strum he's not necessarily a sociopath but you know who knows how this guy was raised maybe
01:49:47.16 --> 01:49:51.32 okay so somebody gets smacked around you know occasionally you beat someone up
01:49:53.16 --> 01:49:58.28 violence is part of you know culture in some parts of America and some families in America
01:49:58.28 --> 01:50:03.72 like that's what you grew up with so that's what you get so to once again to answer your question
01:50:04.52 --> 01:50:08.28 you got to put you got to put the very clear guardrails in place that said hey look this is
01:50:08.28 --> 01:50:13.32 what we're doing this what we're not doing and then you have to have the the consistency that
01:50:13.32 --> 01:50:18.60 when you say something the guys know that you are not playing around and that you are going to fall
01:50:18.60 --> 01:50:23.88 through with whatever it is you say and and and I think where guys get caught sometimes from a
01:50:23.88 --> 01:50:29.72 leadership perspective is they don't put out those guardrails and then when Ben crosses the line
01:50:29.72 --> 01:50:33.16 and you do something you weren't supposed to do I feel kind of bad because I didn't even tell you
01:50:33.16 --> 01:50:37.72 not to do it so I'm looking at you on well I guess I'm going to you know send you to court
01:50:37.72 --> 01:50:42.84 marshal now and you're going wait a second you know we killed three guys on that last operation
01:50:42.84 --> 01:50:45.40 and four guys on the operation before that now you're mad at me because I killed somebody
01:50:46.04 --> 01:50:50.04 well what were the circumstances well you didn't talk to me about any circumstances well you
01:50:50.04 --> 01:50:52.60 got to know the rules of engagement well I know the rules of engagement that seemed like that
01:50:52.60 --> 01:50:59.000 way to me so you see where I'm going with this I have to be very clear about what the line is
01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:07.96 and why we cannot cross it it also seems like like an extreme team environment like I
01:51:07.96 --> 01:51:14.12 said like in football it seemed like there was some sociopaths there too and actually no of one
01:51:14.12 --> 01:51:21.72 who's I think he's still in jail right now but he in an extreme team environment it's like people
01:51:21.72 --> 01:51:25.72 who are just normal people who are I'm down for the team they get influence just to do stuff
01:51:25.72 --> 01:51:33.40 good and bad just because of the team environment do you find that a lot 100% where it's like I mean
01:51:33.40 --> 01:51:38.44 actually you know it now that I'm thinking of like the massacres certainly yes for sure I mean I'm
01:51:38.44 --> 01:51:42.28 asker that's definitely what happened like although that's what we're doing okay we're ready for
01:51:42.28 --> 01:51:46.12 you know I've been talking a lot about this lately is just the fact that people human beings are so
01:51:46.76 --> 01:51:52.52 so their brains are so applyable you can program a person so easily to believe whatever and by the
01:51:52.52 --> 01:51:55.72 way it's happening all day long right now with all these people out there that are looking at
01:51:55.72 --> 01:51:59.88 their social media all day long that's they're getting program you're receiving information
01:51:59.88 --> 01:52:04.12 you don't even know what you're you're seeing and it's happening right now you know the the
01:52:04.12 --> 01:52:08.44 propaganda that's coming out from both sides from from Ukraine right it's like all you have people
01:52:08.44 --> 01:52:15.16 going high into the right on whatever image that they saw and you gotta take everything that's coming
01:52:15.16 --> 01:52:21.72 out of there where the grain is salt but what it's showing you is how easily influenced human beings are
01:52:21.72 --> 01:52:25.56 and that's a really negative thing but it's also really positive thing because you as a leader have
01:52:25.56 --> 01:52:31.40 the ability to say hey here's what's going on here's what we need to do here's why we need to do it
01:52:31.40 --> 01:52:38.60 here's why we can go to this line and we can't go past it and those are the rules that's that's
01:52:38.60 --> 01:52:47.16 what you need to do if you start to allow slack and then you develop a habit of allowing slack
01:52:47.16 --> 01:52:50.68 you're gonna have a freaking issue you're gonna have you're gonna you're gonna end up with issues
01:52:50.68 --> 01:52:54.28 if you don't have the ability to say hey listen dude just not we're not doing that
01:52:54.28 --> 01:53:00.60 uh one thing that's interesting in the in the seal teams is most of the guys want to do a good job
01:53:00.60 --> 01:53:08.20 and have a good reputation so when you say hey hey Ben we're not doing that or hey Ben it
01:53:08.20 --> 01:53:11.000 looks seem like you were thinking about doing something let me tell you why we're not doing it
01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:16.44 you don't go rules bullshit no you go they had got it boss thanks for explaining that to me it's not
01:53:16.44 --> 01:53:22.76 that hard but if I'm weak and you know that you end up with that dynamic in the military where you have
01:53:22.76 --> 01:53:30.36 a really strong personality or really strong yeah really strong in a brand new officer yep and
01:53:30.36 --> 01:53:37.40 if that that can that that's a classic scenario right that's the that's the damn platoon right that's
01:53:37.40 --> 01:53:43.96 the the movie platoon right you have you have Barnes and you have whatever that officer's name was and
01:53:43.96 --> 01:53:50.68 he just gets run rough shot over by Barnes and that's a perfect example that's a perfect example hey
01:53:50.68 --> 01:53:54.76 you're a new guy shut up you don't know what you're talking about this is the only way to win this okay
01:53:54.76 --> 01:54:03.96 well yes or yes yes sergeant Barnes and then you have a guy like alias who is saying hey but what
01:54:03.96 --> 01:54:11.48 what are you doing but he doesn't have the strength to back it up to into to get his platoon officer
01:54:11.48 --> 01:54:16.28 on board with what's happening so to classic thing to watch out for 100%
01:54:16.28 --> 01:54:24.92 um all right let's jump back into the book here go a little bit more forward going to chapter 4
01:54:25.80 --> 01:54:32.84 chapter 4 draper Kaufman and the course that cracked the Atlantic wall then laid the first bricks
01:54:32.84 --> 01:54:40.68 of the legends of navy the legend of navy special warfare so there you go um and this would just
01:54:40.68 --> 01:54:48.52 really you should have you should have saved that dramatic intake for the last chapter that's the
01:54:48.52 --> 01:54:52.52 longest of the they they they get there's only one that's short there's only one more that's coming
01:54:52.52 --> 01:55:01.24 that's short um i'm gonna read a little chunk from the book here landing at 0625
01:55:01.96 --> 01:55:07.000 one of the earliest crews to arrive Gregory and the army engineers had dragged their rubber boat
01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:12.84 into the surf lashed it to a wooden stake and run for the farthest belt of hedgehogs
01:55:14.52 --> 01:55:21.80 it looked impossible to be there without being hit one of karnowski's men remembered afterward
01:55:22.52 --> 01:55:28.92 it looked even worse without a helmet despite the chaos karnowski and the demolition years
01:55:28.92 --> 01:55:34.04 laid their charges ran out their primer court tied in and blew their charge the first shot
01:55:34.04 --> 01:55:41.32 was magnificent remembered one man after it nothing else was as soon as the charge blew machine guns
01:55:41.32 --> 01:55:47.40 opened up from everywhere and men pushed their bellies into the sand conrad millis a quiet california
01:55:47.40 --> 01:55:52.68 carpenter made chief petty officer for the example he had set during training grabbed the primer
01:55:53.24 --> 01:55:59.40 grab the primer court real and sprinted for the next row of obstacles he was identified later
01:55:59.40 --> 01:56:04.04 by the pack of explosives around his neck with a big hole in his chest
01:56:05.64 --> 01:56:09.96 as the waves of infantry landed the demolition job grew even more complicated
01:56:09.96 --> 01:56:16.36 terrified soldiers either did not notice the purple smoke warnings swirling around them or did not
01:56:16.36 --> 01:56:20.92 care i thought i'd never get one of the infantrymen out from behind a piling a demolition
01:56:20.92 --> 01:56:26.44 year confessed later he moved out just in time and our second shot went off
01:56:26.44 --> 01:56:32.36 as obstacles blew apart the army and navy sections began working together mingling as a single
01:56:32.36 --> 01:56:38.36 team regardless of the advancing tide lieutenant gregarie having destroyed the tank crippling
01:56:38.36 --> 01:56:43.24 hedgehogs at the far end of the beach turned away from the enemy and splashed back into the
01:56:43.24 --> 01:56:49.56 surf like a man possessed he waited or swam to each remaining stake where he waited until someone
01:56:49.56 --> 01:56:56.04 threw him a charge then using the lessons taught to him by the ncd use stretched his arms as far as
01:56:56.04 --> 01:57:04.20 they would reach and placed his bomb next to rommels then blew them to nothing
01:57:08.28 --> 01:57:18.92 so d day you you talk about this being the most consequential day in in the history of NSW
01:57:18.92 --> 01:57:26.04 there's a hundred and navy a hundred and ninety navy demolition years 32 of them are killed 65
01:57:26.04 --> 01:57:34.04 or wounded so that's a total number of casualties being at 97 this is 51 percent 51 percent
01:57:34.04 --> 01:57:40.52 casualties yeah i mean just in contribution or just in sacrifice it's uh um
01:57:40.52 --> 01:57:51.32 right i'll match as any other tragedy or uh that NSW has experienced it's far far exceed anything
01:57:51.32 --> 01:57:58.84 it'll at least in any single day experience and this happens mostly in the space of of around three or four
01:57:58.84 --> 01:58:06.84 hours uh gap assault teams um three and fourteen eleven they're all destroyed even before i'm
01:58:06.84 --> 01:58:11.16 right eleven destroyed as soon as it's ramp drops three and fourteen or destroyed uh
01:58:11.16 --> 01:58:16.44 destroyed before the ramps even drop there they would mourn mortars and just about everybody
01:58:16.44 --> 01:58:25.16 and all of a board is killed um it's the it's the most important day of the 20th century i mean it's
01:58:25.16 --> 01:58:33.32 the day that determines um whether or not Hitler's going to be removed from the continent um and it's uh
01:58:33.32 --> 01:58:38.76 uh it's tough to you know write this chapter and not make it you know out China everything else
01:58:38.76 --> 01:58:44.36 it's a um it's too much the chapter was twice as long when i you know when i finished the first
01:58:44.36 --> 01:58:50.76 draft it was i i wanted to i didn't want to leave anything behind i wanted you know every every
01:58:50.76 --> 01:58:56.76 gap assault team every every NCDU to you know have full representation i think there's 21
01:58:56.76 --> 01:59:02.76 um gap assault teams that that land i ultimately had to you know cut cut cut cut cut cut and try and
01:59:02.76 --> 01:59:07.24 you know consolidate as much as possible just so it was a readable chapter and i also had to like
01:59:07.24 --> 01:59:12.68 figure out what the hell am i trying to say in this thing you know i i expected that um
01:59:13.56 --> 01:59:18.44 writing history of the seal teams or writing how the navy had you know been the first to create this
01:59:18.44 --> 01:59:23.96 type of unit i always expected that it'd be tough to justify how i put the you know the army
01:59:23.96 --> 01:59:28.44 or a marine court chapters and it wouldn't be tough to you know justify the navy chapters
01:59:28.44 --> 01:59:32.20 the navy chapters would just sort of write themselves i just had to say what happened just say what
01:59:32.20 --> 01:59:38.04 happened i found the opposite to be true because you know it was you know what the army chapters
01:59:38.04 --> 01:59:42.44 and the marine court chapters all you really just you know trying to show like why these units failed
01:59:42.44 --> 01:59:48.68 or why they um why the you know they're uh senior leaders pulled the rug out from under them
01:59:48.68 --> 01:59:54.04 the navy chapters you're you're having to you know show how um you know a unit like the
01:59:54.04 --> 01:59:58.12 NCD use which is you know created just a solve one problem and that problem is the obstacles
01:59:58.12 --> 02:00:03.24 in France where the obstacles on the coast how did that why is that relevant you know to the
02:00:03.24 --> 02:00:10.60 ultimate creation of go anywhere you know enable commandos so i um it took a long time and it
02:00:10.60 --> 02:00:15.40 took multiple draft before i realized that the point of this whole thing or the the relevance to
02:00:15.40 --> 02:00:22.52 that story is not so much um you know the fact that they were uh you know just blowing up obstacles
02:00:22.52 --> 02:00:28.12 it's the fact that they left such an impression on the navy leaders after that you know there's
02:00:28.12 --> 02:00:33.16 you know there's you know all these um you know episodes of of naval bravery you know there's the
02:00:33.16 --> 02:00:39.000 experience of the uh uh the the the the the the the destroyers that ultimately save the day
02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:44.20 that pushed the army ashore these destroyers you know they're um they're on the outskirts of uh
02:00:44.20 --> 02:00:50.60 of the battle until um Admiral Hall uh uh uh the army the army is looking at what's happening on
02:00:50.60 --> 02:00:54.60 on a mobile beach there's there's there's successful landings on gold sword Juno there's successful
02:00:54.60 --> 02:00:59.80 landings at Utah beach everywhere the you know the you know the the you know the the landing to get
02:00:59.80 --> 02:01:05.80 troops ashore on dda is going well except here at Omaha Omaha you know the army commander's like
02:01:05.80 --> 02:01:10.36 i we might need to pull our troops off they might need to do something they've never trained to do
02:01:10.36 --> 02:01:18.28 which is a full scale evacuation in front of the enemy at Mohal who has um made it a point to make
02:01:18.28 --> 02:01:25.32 sure that he's in charge of the invasion until uh forces are firmly established ashore says no
02:01:25.32 --> 02:01:30.52 we're not doing that and he does what you know nobody has done up to that point which is push uh
02:01:30.52 --> 02:01:36.28 destroyers right up to the uh to the the as close to the coast as possibly pushes them 800 yards away
02:01:36.28 --> 02:01:42.12 uh from from the coast that's the same destroyers they they come in a flank speed and as soon as
02:01:42.12 --> 02:01:47.56 they get to about uh where their poles are about three feet off the bottom they all turn left
02:01:47.56 --> 02:01:52.12 and they all start going right along the coast so you have all this bravery that happens as
02:01:52.12 --> 02:01:56.44 as soon as they get you know to a point to the end of Omaha Beach you think all these ships
02:01:56.44 --> 02:02:02.04 are going to turn um and some of them do some of them have enough uh um um um depth where they're
02:02:02.04 --> 02:02:08.28 able to turn around the ships that don't they just they just reverse reverse uh and they just
02:02:08.28 --> 02:02:14.44 are going backwards and they're blasting uh away at these uh pill boxes and structures and some
02:02:14.44 --> 02:02:21.000 in some cases they are um they're blasting underneath uh the pill boxes so the pill boxes full of
02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:29.72 Germans just start tumbling off the uh uh off the escarpment um um so in all that I think I've seen
02:02:29.72 --> 02:02:36.68 that represented no it's like in saving private Ryan or anything like that no and everybody
02:02:36.68 --> 02:02:45.000 thinks 100 yards off the beach is freaking close everybody walks away or everybody you know
02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:52.76 comes away from you know the reading of Omaha Beach as this um as this victory of uh American
02:02:52.76 --> 02:02:59.32 infantry over you know the German obstacles um and that's true but there's also another truth and that's
02:02:59.32 --> 02:03:04.36 the um uh that's the commitment or that's the force that the Navy brought to bear on that day and
02:03:04.36 --> 02:03:08.44 then and the army would not have gotten off those killing fields or other killing beaches without
02:03:08.44 --> 02:03:15.80 the contribution of the US Navy but what I found was the point of this chapter was that with all of
02:03:15.80 --> 02:03:22.44 that with all of the the the the the contribution that the Navy had made with all the bravery um the
02:03:22.44 --> 02:03:30.68 the Navy walks away from that battle uh with knowing that the the greatest contribution that they'd
02:03:30.68 --> 02:03:36.68 given that day was with the naval over with with the NCDUs with the naval combat demolition units um
02:03:36.68 --> 02:03:43.32 they are awarded you know some this six Navy crosses um more silver stars and you can check a
02:03:43.32 --> 02:03:49.24 stick at they've got they they award the NCDUs only one of three uh presidential unit
02:03:49.24 --> 02:03:55.80 citations that are awarded from uh a naval unit on Omaha Beach um right so the reason that that's
02:03:55.80 --> 02:04:01.48 so important is because uh when the Navy when the dust settles uh and the the Navy is looking at you
02:04:01.48 --> 02:04:06.60 know they're entire contribution uh at Omaha Beach they know that uh they know how important the
02:04:06.60 --> 02:04:12.36 NCDUs contribution was and more importantly they know how important uh the the curriculum was
02:04:12.36 --> 02:04:19.32 the created these units and that curriculum I don't know if anybody uh in charge of Omaha Beach
02:04:19.32 --> 02:04:25.32 had realized what curriculum had created them but there are people that know and that curriculum
02:04:25.32 --> 02:04:32.84 is now um validated because of uh of everything the NCDUs did and that curriculum as you know
02:04:33.80 --> 02:04:38.04 you know develop a driver coffin yeah and the main part of that curriculum is hell weak
02:04:38.04 --> 02:04:45.000 yeah the the crucible of that curriculum is hell weak and then and the reason that it's it's
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:51.56 developed is because you know it's the closest thing of the least draper coffin it ever uh
02:04:51.56 --> 02:05:01.24 coming contact with two combat I mean it's a um it at least it matches the experience the draper
02:05:01.24 --> 02:05:06.68 coffin it had when it came to uh combat he'd been you know we can get the draper coffin but um
02:05:06.68 --> 02:05:14.28 um it prepared the guys that went to Omaha Beach uh for exactly what they experienced you know they were
02:05:16.28 --> 02:05:21.96 they were wet they were cold I mean they'd spent almost 48 hours on on ships that were you know
02:05:21.96 --> 02:05:27.88 often some of these ships were sinking of prior to they were so overwhelmed with uh with water and rain
02:05:27.88 --> 02:05:35.48 and um uh that you know they went into battle cold hungry um often you know nearly all of them
02:05:35.48 --> 02:05:39.000 receasic they're all wretched their gut sounds they don't have anything in them when they hit the
02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:45.24 beaches um and then the uh the chaos that unfolds around them is uh they've they've gotten at
02:05:45.24 --> 02:05:49.80 least a taste of it uh on the beaches at Fort Pierce they you know they you know the you know the
02:05:49.80 --> 02:05:55.88 the so-solly day I mean they've been uh peppered with all these bombs going off around them um
02:05:55.88 --> 02:06:01.08 they were probably better prepared for what uh what they encountered than any other troops on Omaha Beach
02:06:01.08 --> 02:06:13.32 yeah the the hell week thing is definitely interesting um because it is it's shocking when you
02:06:13.32 --> 02:06:18.76 when you you look at it and you know the kind of people that show up just the numbers of people that show
02:06:18.76 --> 02:06:24.20 up I mean a class will start with a couple hundred people and by the time they're done with hell
02:06:24.20 --> 02:06:34.52 week they'll be down to 10 15 20 percent of that and these are people that enlisted in the navy
02:06:34.52 --> 02:06:40.20 that had a goal that told their families they were going to be navy seals that dedicated six
02:06:40.20 --> 02:06:45.80 years of their life to signing that dotted line they trained they worked they went to boot camp they
02:06:45.80 --> 02:06:51.40 gave up whatever other possibilities they had in life and they've poured all that into this one singular
02:06:51.40 --> 02:06:57.000 dream without a fallback plan to with no with the crappiest fall there's a fallback plan it just sucks
02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:00.20 sucks but I mean it's not like if you go to the marine court like and you don't you know get into the
02:07:00.20 --> 02:07:03.32 arms like you can still be a pretty awesome marine you're freaking infantrymen in the marine
02:07:03.32 --> 02:07:06.84 court which is a beautiful thing and it's the same thing with the army special operation so you don't
02:07:06.84 --> 02:07:10.84 make it through special forces training okay cool you're a freaking ground pounder which is awesome
02:07:11.80 --> 02:07:16.28 the navy you don't make it through seal training and if you have the mindset where you want to be
02:07:16.28 --> 02:07:23.40 some kind of a machine gun toten badass well guess what you don't make it through seal training
02:07:23.40 --> 02:07:30.36 you are literally not going to be a machine gun toting badass at all and and and that's a horrible
02:07:30.36 --> 02:07:37.48 horrible fate for these young guys but they know that that's their fate and yet with that fate
02:07:38.20 --> 02:07:45.88 they still bring that bell and people from every background people that were division one
02:07:45.88 --> 02:07:53.24 athlete so if every division one athlete wrestlers football players you name it swimmers runners they
02:07:53.24 --> 02:07:59.000 all quit people that were you know raised with a silver spoon in the mouth that went to ivy
02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:03.48 schools they quit people that were raised in the ghetto with really hard lives they quit some
02:08:03.48 --> 02:08:06.60 of them make it some of them quit same with the ivy league some of them make it some of them quit
02:08:07.88 --> 02:08:14.04 it's a crazy crucible and and we still don't even understand it we don't understand who's
02:08:14.04 --> 02:08:18.44 going to make it now I think the only thing that we we really know is where it came from that's about
02:08:18.44 --> 02:08:26.28 it and we don't and I mean as much as draper cough been wrote and I came I mean when I so I
02:08:26.28 --> 02:08:35.08 went to his daughter's house in indiana and she let me have you know two days just to go through
02:08:35.08 --> 02:08:40.36 this entire this humongous file cabinet he kept everything and I there was letters I mean tons of
02:08:40.36 --> 02:08:45.24 the letters between you know him family and friends one thing that he never really kind of
02:08:46.28 --> 02:08:50.92 talked about at least contemporaneously he only really talked about it in his oral history was this
02:08:51.72 --> 02:08:56.68 you know this hell week that he invented I mean and nobody really I mean all the guys that went
02:08:56.68 --> 02:09:01.08 through it talked about it he didn't even talk about you know his own experience going through it so
02:09:01.08 --> 02:09:06.44 after he created hell week and he didn't really create hell week all he did was compress you know
02:09:06.44 --> 02:09:11.56 that that curriculum that you know fill buckloom and all those other scouts and raiders they
02:09:11.56 --> 02:09:16.28 established it all draper coughman did was like okay I like this this is eight weeks long that's
02:09:16.28 --> 02:09:21.96 great let's put it let's make all this five days it's like I can do that well you're just going
02:09:21.96 --> 02:09:26.44 to cut out all this stuff you don't need like you know like sleep well just you know keep keep
02:09:26.44 --> 02:09:30.36 you keep it guy and he did it himself I mean he now lead you know it creates this he put
02:09:30.36 --> 02:09:35.56 himself through the training at 32 years old yeah 30 10 years old and he's a terrible athlete he's a terrible
02:09:35.56 --> 02:09:40.84 athlete just terrible swimmer he can't he can't qualify me his his eyesight he can't even qualify
02:09:40.84 --> 02:09:47.000 for the standards that he sets for himself or for sets for the program like he would not be he would
02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:56.20 not qualify for you know the course that he creates and he does it you visited you visited where
02:09:56.20 --> 02:10:02.92 Omaha Beach you visited four peers yeah how is that with the with the breadth of knowledge that
02:10:02.92 --> 02:10:11.000 you have when you're down there it's incredible it's um there's nothing quite like you know
02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:15.24 going to the places that you're writing about I could have gone I wish I could have gone to
02:10:15.24 --> 02:10:20.20 every single place that I wrote about I've kind of made it a mental mandate for me of a future
02:10:20.20 --> 02:10:27.88 book I'm never going to write about anything unless I go to the place um the uh there's a way to
02:10:27.88 --> 02:10:36.52 Omaha I mean there's a way to you know all of all of Normandy and I mean you I'm not sure
02:10:37.24 --> 02:10:42.36 which point you you should go to the cemetery at Omaha Beach if you should go to the cemetery first
02:10:43.08 --> 02:10:46.36 before you go to the beach heads and before you go to all the battlefields and point to Hawke
02:10:46.36 --> 02:10:50.68 or if you should go see the battlefields and point to Hawke and everything and then go to the cemetery
02:10:51.24 --> 02:10:56.68 either way um you're going to that cemetery and you're going to walk around it and the one thing
02:10:56.68 --> 02:11:01.32 you're going to see and there's a poem by Robert Frost when you before you go to that cemetery and
02:11:01.32 --> 02:11:13.08 it said something like you know uh don't talk um just listen just look and uh note the dates on
02:11:13.08 --> 02:11:20.12 these headstones note how young they were and they died for you and it's it's overwhelming
02:11:21.08 --> 02:11:25.80 and then to take that and then to go see the places where all of these guys were you see
02:11:25.80 --> 02:11:30.52 dog grain dog red and all the all the beaches and then you go to point to Hawke you can't even look
02:11:30.52 --> 02:11:36.76 over the cliffs I mean you see where these rangers they climbed up like and then I mean
02:11:37.72 --> 02:11:41.16 the Germans at the top are cut and ropes and they're throwing grenades and they're leaning over
02:11:41.16 --> 02:11:47.32 the cliffs and they're machine gunning them off the ropes and still they came um and the
02:11:47.32 --> 02:11:54.04 the section that you read of uh karnowski uh he dropped his helmet in the water before you know
02:11:54.04 --> 02:12:00.68 the operation even started before the you know the um for the ramp even dropped he did not have
02:12:00.68 --> 02:12:05.88 a helmet and you you know spent a ran you know from you know and and where was he going to get
02:12:05.88 --> 02:12:09.72 a helmet everybody else needed their helmet there's no other helmets to take and he you know ran
02:12:09.72 --> 02:12:19.08 a shore and um wasn't able to get a helmet you know for almost 24 hours you finally finally
02:12:19.08 --> 02:12:25.80 found a helmet there wasn't a task to somebody that uh he was able to take but yeah and how
02:12:25.80 --> 02:12:30.84 about four pierce four pierces really something then we can talk about four four pierces
02:12:30.84 --> 02:12:36.52 a bit later either there's a uh recently went to four pierces were their annual muster
02:12:36.52 --> 02:12:43.56 and um but yeah I four pierces one of the first places I went and um I didn't I didn't quite
02:12:43.56 --> 02:12:48.76 understand like uh what the island was like with the what the separation of Hutchinson Island was
02:12:48.76 --> 02:12:53.08 because four pierces the actual town it's on the mainland where Hutchinson Island were act you
02:12:53.08 --> 02:12:58.36 know that's what we call we'll call or that's what we call you know four pierces it's actually
02:12:58.36 --> 02:13:02.44 two separate islands there's it's an intercoast all uh island that separates you know from the
02:13:02.44 --> 02:13:06.76 Indian river and the Atlantic Ocean Atlantic is you know kind of a crushing surf and you can see
02:13:06.76 --> 02:13:14.44 all the rocks that are there I mean um the the idea of rock portage and everything like that we all
02:13:14.44 --> 02:13:19.64 you know we you know we always think of it as you know right there at the hotel del
02:13:19.64 --> 02:13:23.88 yeah you know you get this fairy tale hotel you know and and these you know you know you
02:13:23.88 --> 02:13:30.12 know you know humongous you know rocks they have the exact same rocks right there for pierce
02:13:30.12 --> 02:13:35.08 and they did the exact same rock portage you know it's just as dangerous then as it is now um
02:13:35.72 --> 02:13:40.44 but you you you you can see it I mean you uh you can see you know this is the birthplace this is
02:13:40.44 --> 02:13:44.84 where it all happened and it wasn't just the birthplace of you know the NCD used in the scouts and
02:13:44.84 --> 02:13:49.96 raiders but it was the birthplace of you know kind of uh American special operations thinking
02:13:49.96 --> 02:13:53.88 everybody took a turn at four pierces anybody was gonna do any sort of amphibious training any
02:13:53.88 --> 02:13:59.56 special unit was going to take a stop at four pierces the raiders the uh uh the army raiders
02:13:59.56 --> 02:14:05.40 that you know you know uh one of the subwoofer on the Dallas they all everybody everybody
02:14:05.40 --> 02:14:12.36 took a turn through four pierces it was the um um it was the garden bed of uh uh uh
02:14:12.36 --> 02:14:19.16 of special operations thinking at the time so um yeah and if you you might just mentioned the
02:14:19.16 --> 02:14:24.36 the UDTCL museum which is down there in four pierces and that's freaking unbelievable it isn't
02:14:24.36 --> 02:14:30.52 awesome thing that they're continuing to build down there yeah um couldn't have done the book
02:14:30.52 --> 02:14:34.52 without it oh really like as far as them given you information important you in the
02:14:34.52 --> 02:14:41.56 art direction you know it was the first place that I went to and it was um um this was I went there
02:14:41.56 --> 02:14:49.40 before I even knew what an archive was and their archive is um it's not it's not really an art
02:14:49.40 --> 02:14:54.12 I mean it's a it's a it's a room with a bunch of file cabinets and the first time that I went in
02:14:54.12 --> 02:15:02.76 there you know nobody um uh nobody told me what I couldn't look at I mean I just I just went
02:15:02.76 --> 02:15:06.92 in there with a camera and you know I got to work I didn't know where World War II was and
02:15:06.92 --> 02:15:14.36 where Korea was Vietnam but it's all in there and I was gathering stuff that you know um I
02:15:14.36 --> 02:15:18.04 didn't know what I was looking at I took a thousand pictures away my first day at an archive and
02:15:18.04 --> 02:15:22.60 it took me a month to go through them and just to sort of you know figure out this is this this is
02:15:22.60 --> 02:15:28.60 that you know this is an operations plan for Okinawa this is a you know this is an operator for
02:15:29.32 --> 02:15:36.12 you know a trained demolition raid in Korea something like that I mean um but yeah that was the first
02:15:36.12 --> 02:15:42.68 time that I you know really kind of got the evidence of the cold case mystery that I was trying to
02:15:42.68 --> 02:15:52.52 sort out um all right let's move on to and again I've already told you
02:15:52.52 --> 02:15:56.12 if you're listening to this to buy this book and to do it as quickly as you possibly can
02:15:56.84 --> 02:16:00.76 we're literally just hitting wave tops on this stuff there's so much incredible information
02:16:01.48 --> 02:16:06.92 obviously D-Day I mean I read one I read two paragraphs about D-Day there's an entire incredible
02:16:06.92 --> 02:16:14.76 section about all of it about draper Kaufman who we covered him a lot on the first the first time
02:16:14.76 --> 02:16:21.40 you were on because he's such a inc such an incredible character he's not the guy that you would think
02:16:21.40 --> 02:16:27.40 created or was one of the one of the lead role players in creating this organization that we have
02:16:28.68 --> 02:16:35.72 he's a guy you know you know you pointed out on that first podcast is he's a guy that was
02:16:37.08 --> 02:16:40.92 didn't really want to be he didn't want to be some kind of commander he wanted to be a
02:16:40.92 --> 02:16:44.52 a naval officer that wasn't charge of a ship and it just what wasn't gonna happen for him as I
02:16:44.52 --> 02:16:50.44 say it was bad it wasn't gonna happen and he just made things happen he looked around and said
02:16:50.44 --> 02:16:57.08 all right well what can I do and what does the military need what does the what does the what does
02:16:57.08 --> 02:17:01.40 the the the fighting people need because he wasn't necessarily gonna work for America either
02:17:01.40 --> 02:17:07.08 is I who's fighting I'm in yeah I think that's an important I mean for anybody who's trying to
02:17:07.08 --> 02:17:11.16 be a seal right now I mean whether you succeed or whether you don't I mean there's so many ways to
02:17:11.16 --> 02:17:15.56 serve your country I mean here's a guy who spent four years that naval academy hoping to fulfill
02:17:15.56 --> 02:17:21.08 his dream to be a destroyer sailor he wants to just be on a destroyer that's all he wants and it's
02:17:21.08 --> 02:17:26.52 you know the rugs pulled out from under him right at the moment he's he's ready to take the fleet
02:17:26.52 --> 02:17:31.72 and he's got to come up with plan B there's an old plan B he's gonna be but he doesn't you know
02:17:31.72 --> 02:17:41.24 let that paralyze him he when he doesn't see a way to contribute to his country he makes one up
02:17:41.24 --> 02:17:48.52 and he makes one up again the thing that just keeps the his guiding star in that whole process
02:17:48.52 --> 02:17:54.60 it's just like I want to be useful I want to you know help and I want to be as close as I can to
02:17:54.60 --> 02:17:59.72 you know to that to that help and if I can you know if I can't fight then I'll carry
02:17:59.72 --> 02:18:05.24 all carry stretchers I'll be an ambulance driver if I can't be an RAF pilot or if I can't be on a
02:18:05.24 --> 02:18:11.56 British ship then I will dispose the bombs that are landing in central London if I can't be a ship
02:18:11.56 --> 02:18:17.48 driver in the US Navy then I will teach the rest of the Navy how to dismantle bombs I'll do whatever I can and then
02:18:17.48 --> 02:18:27.80 money's anyway yeah that's it's an incredible incredible story that it's just crazy it's a crazy
02:18:27.80 --> 02:18:34.92 thing he's a he comes a French ambulance driver and then becomes a British naval officer and then
02:18:34.92 --> 02:18:40.84 finally they eventually led him into the US Navy that's crazy yeah I mean if you want to like for
02:18:40.84 --> 02:18:46.92 somebody and his dad is one of the most famous destroyer skippers in the Navy and his dad I mean
02:18:46.92 --> 02:18:53.32 who clearly loves the sun I mean you see the you see the paralysis and you know like we talked
02:18:53.32 --> 02:18:58.28 about last time the paralysis and the letters between the two like he knows that the sun's
02:18:58.28 --> 02:19:03.56 going to be committed or sent on these you know terribly dangerous missions it's never been done
02:19:03.56 --> 02:19:09.48 before like when before draper coffin heads out with UDT5 to scout the beaches for a
02:19:09.48 --> 02:19:15.48 side pan his dad knows that these guys are going into combat with nothing and the letters are
02:19:16.12 --> 02:19:20.68 you know he signs them off you know just the same way you know anybody any any other dad would you know
02:19:21.72 --> 02:19:27.48 love you lots and lots of luck and that's all I can do like it's all I can do for you it's not going
02:19:27.48 --> 02:19:37.64 to be a second or see it on a sun's behalf craziness chapter five the evolving contest that
02:19:37.64 --> 02:19:46.12 created the merman of war world war two is only indispensable special operations unit so we we
02:19:46.12 --> 02:19:52.04 we have that controversy about the merman yes we don't really like that term we don't but it's
02:19:52.04 --> 02:19:58.52 out it's what got used right well yeah yeah they used it I mean that's the I think that was the
02:19:58.52 --> 02:20:05.56 the rigley spirit mack gum hour that was on the radio I mean that's where it came from they called
02:20:05.56 --> 02:20:12.12 they came to merman of war yeah unfortunate little puppy's history but we can't change it
02:20:12.12 --> 02:20:17.32 all right going to the book here real quick and the in the late summer of 1943 right about the same
02:20:17.32 --> 02:20:21.80 time that draper coffin was putting himself through hell week U.S. commanders in the Pacific were
02:20:21.80 --> 02:20:29.16 about to initiate two campaigns with one ultimate objective the invasion of Japan blocked by a
02:20:29.16 --> 02:20:34.92 swath of ocean five times the size of the sahera and whose every atoll had been turned into a
02:20:34.92 --> 02:20:40.92 Japanese fortress the strategy to accomplish this objective was wanting which the allies would leap
02:20:40.92 --> 02:20:47.32 frog most islands especially the most robustly defended let them wither on the vine said Douglas
02:20:47.32 --> 02:20:53.72 MacArthur and sees a handful upon which they could build airfield substantial enough to support
02:20:53.72 --> 02:21:00.20 the long range four engine bombers needing to need it to soften up the next handful on the way
02:21:00.20 --> 02:21:06.60 to mainland Japan in the south Pacific this path would progress from the mountainous jungles of
02:21:06.60 --> 02:21:12.60 guadal canal to a nearby group of similar islands many well chartered and populated and all
02:21:12.60 --> 02:21:19.16 of them battle fields large enough for the U.S. armies and MacArthur's ambitions in the central
02:21:19.16 --> 02:21:25.64 Pacific this path would start some two thousand miles west of Hawaii in the Gilbert island chain
02:21:25.64 --> 02:21:32.04 the first Lily Pans large enough to support bomber sized airfields but so small so remote
02:21:32.04 --> 02:21:38.76 so daunting that their volcanic spines of white sand and green palms could almost be mistaken
02:21:38.76 --> 02:21:45.40 for the rigid backs of a thousand sea monsters and there was only one branch of service
02:21:45.40 --> 02:21:51.80 that could lead the hunt against those the same branch that would go on to break hitlers at
02:21:51.80 --> 02:21:59.72 land at wall but employing in altogether different kind of method indeed a method unlike any
02:21:59.72 --> 02:22:07.56 in military history so you're setting us up pretty strong there right
02:22:07.56 --> 02:22:15.24 for this to make them for the merman true true this is the first time the navy is kind of
02:22:15.24 --> 02:22:22.36 the master of the battle space first time in history and that's gonna play into a significant role
02:22:22.36 --> 02:22:29.40 because we need to get on to these islands we need to figure out how to get on to these islands
02:22:29.80 --> 02:22:34.68 and there's this weird little gap this weird little gap of information this weird little gap of
02:22:34.68 --> 02:22:46.60 tactical control that no one really knows how to fill what's the what's the myth behind
02:22:47.48 --> 02:22:54.92 Taurua the Taurua is every history that I'd ever read about the seal teams
02:22:54.92 --> 02:23:06.92 starts with a vineet about Taurua and that Taurua is this meat grinder battle in 1943
02:23:07.72 --> 02:23:17.000 in which the Marines they take this island and the central Pacific and in three days
02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:22.76 the Marines lose as many men as they've lost in the entire six month battle for Guadalcanal
02:23:22.76 --> 02:23:30.28 it's it's it's the first time that Americans realize that this is going to be this is going to be
02:23:30.28 --> 02:23:35.32 something this is like the Shiloh moment in the Civil War where Americans realize this is going to be
02:23:36.12 --> 02:23:42.44 everybody's terrible it's going to be a monster and you're going to have to do this on island
02:23:42.44 --> 02:23:48.92 on every island across the Pacific to get to Japan if we're going to carry this you know
02:23:48.92 --> 02:23:55.72 FDR's policy of unconditional surrender against the Japanese this is going to be a bloody
02:23:55.72 --> 02:24:03.48 bloody battle or bloody way to do it and so the idea is that you know part of the reason the
02:24:03.48 --> 02:24:08.12 Taurua was such a meat grinder is because the landing craft couldn't get past the coral reefs
02:24:08.12 --> 02:24:13.08 which is true the landing craft couldn't get past the coral reefs and that's going to be a problem
02:24:13.08 --> 02:24:18.52 on every subsequent battle but the Marines had already anticipated that the Navy had already
02:24:18.52 --> 02:24:23.72 anticipated that and they had fielded a new technological solution to overcome it which was the LVT
02:24:23.72 --> 02:24:29.88 or the amphibious tractor it wasn't landing craft as much as it was you know a tractor that could
02:24:29.88 --> 02:24:36.68 float and it certainly got to a coral it would just crawl right over it I think they brought 125
02:24:37.40 --> 02:24:44.36 Tatarua there I think there's only a handful left by the end of the first day the rest are
02:24:44.36 --> 02:24:52.92 technologically they're broken so the subsequent days the only Marines that can land to support
02:24:53.56 --> 02:24:58.52 her you know they're kept on the outskirts of the battle by this coral reefs so they have to
02:24:58.52 --> 02:25:02.36 you know drive up the Higgins boats they drop their ramps the Marines rush out into the coral
02:25:02.36 --> 02:25:07.16 and they jump into the lagoon and then they got this 3,000 yard wave to shore where they've got to
02:25:07.16 --> 02:25:12.84 you know deal with mortars the sheen gunfire and there's a you know pilots that are flying above
02:25:12.84 --> 02:25:20.28 this tragedy and and they the the record is that you know this lagoon this you know pristine blue lagoon
02:25:20.28 --> 02:25:26.68 it never it's never free of red I mean it's just it's a it's a see a wash with red the entire three days
02:25:29.08 --> 02:25:35.48 and and it's it leaves an impression on everybody encounters it just because of the
02:25:36.12 --> 02:25:39.24 you know the Marines that are being pulled from this lagoon for the next three days they can
02:25:39.24 --> 02:25:43.24 play there just know they don't have hair they're completely swollen it's a it's a crime scene every
02:25:43.24 --> 02:25:51.24 every single person in there that's a crime scene so the you know the myth is that because of this
02:25:51.80 --> 02:25:56.36 you know the navy decides that they have to on every subsequent battle they've got to
02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:02.76 creating unit that can destroy the coral so the landing craft can get in there which is true sort of
02:26:03.80 --> 02:26:07.80 the landing craft you know the the the coral is a problem and it does need to be destroyed
02:26:07.80 --> 02:26:15.56 the bigger issue that creates the UDT which ultimately creates a seal team is not so much the
02:26:15.56 --> 02:26:24.92 coral as it is the fact that the navy is at this point in the war they're not given access to the
02:26:24.92 --> 02:26:30.12 Marine Corps special units because the Marine Corps like I said in chapter one they have elevated
02:26:30.12 --> 02:26:35.56 their status to such a point that they are now on parity with the navy so up until that point the
02:26:35.56 --> 02:26:41.16 Marine or the the navy had this impression that the Marine Corps was at subservient service and on
02:26:41.16 --> 02:26:47.40 every battle navy add rules could trump Marine Corps generals but at this point in the war Marine
02:26:47.40 --> 02:26:54.68 Corps generals they're just as they're they're on they're on par with their their navy add
02:26:54.68 --> 02:27:00.12 rules so if the navy wants to send out reconnaissance troops a special reconnaissance mission or
02:27:00.12 --> 02:27:03.80 if they wanted to conduct a raid or anything like that they've got to go through the Marine
02:27:03.80 --> 02:27:08.52 Corps because they're the only guys that are there they only service that has a unit that could do
02:27:08.52 --> 02:27:15.32 any of those things so when Turner Turner is the the commander of the fifth amphibious force
02:27:15.32 --> 02:27:23.24 he does not he hates this policy absolutely hates it he's the he's the biggest I describe
02:27:23.24 --> 02:27:31.000 Ms. the the first a personification of an actual life aab and the pacific theater he is he's the
02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:38.36 biggest the biggest dick that's ever served in the the the surface navy he's a he's a he's a
02:27:38.36 --> 02:27:44.20 he's a tyrant almost and he absolutely hates the fact that he does not have control of the
02:27:44.20 --> 02:27:50.28 Marines in the way that he anticipated having control of the Marines so he's not as concerned about
02:27:50.28 --> 02:27:56.76 destroying the coral as he is with having his own unit that he can control that he can send out to
02:27:56.76 --> 02:28:02.84 find out information and either find it out cut it out whatever that's why he creates the UDTs
02:28:03.88 --> 02:28:12.60 it's not a it's not a issue of coral as it is a control yeah one of the characters
02:28:13.48 --> 02:28:22.12 that you cut I guess James Jones from the recon company what's this guy all about James Jones is
02:28:22.12 --> 02:28:28.92 so one of the options that the navy had prior to this sort of re-alignment or reassessment of
02:28:28.92 --> 02:28:33.40 Navy of Marine Corps authority would would have been the back recon company the the the
02:28:33.40 --> 02:28:41.40 the back fifth amphibious force VAC that would have been a unit that Kelly Turner Admiral Turner
02:28:41.40 --> 02:28:47.000 would have had access to to send on special special missions special assignments including missions
02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:54.92 to destroy coral fine coral things like that but now that the Marine Corps is you know has the
02:28:54.92 --> 02:29:00.52 status that it does you know it doesn't really have access to this unit anymore but it's a it's sort of
02:29:00.52 --> 02:29:06.28 the the replacement for the Marine Corps Raiders it's not as big as the Raiders were intended to be but
02:29:06.28 --> 02:29:13.88 they they they sort of formed us unit around James Jones he's a he's a really interesting character
02:29:13.88 --> 02:29:20.12 he was a tractor salesman in Africa before the war and just by being a tractor salesman he
02:29:20.12 --> 02:29:26.28 manages to pick up multiple languages is a really really interesting guy and he was one of the initial
02:29:27.56 --> 02:29:32.04 guys that put in charge of the of the observer group which was the unit that ultimately became
02:29:32.04 --> 02:29:41.56 the scouts and Raiders is a side note he is the father of James Jones the national of
02:29:43.96 --> 02:29:50.52 Obama's first national security advisor. Great father or grandfather father wow he's a father
02:29:50.52 --> 02:29:57.000 and I so when I was doing my initial research for this I was trying to get an interview with with him.
02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:07.40 No no dice I was close I had I was going back back and forth with his secretary he has a
02:30:08.20 --> 02:30:12.60 not a non-profit but like a strategic thing thing thing and I was going back and forth with his
02:30:13.24 --> 02:30:20.68 secretary couldn't make it work so no dice you're right no dice no dice and well then what happened
02:30:20.68 --> 02:30:31.000 with the with the back with them the back re-con company they initially they they have some
02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:40.84 a pretty pretty impressive raids right around the time of tarua they they raid a little island of
02:30:40.84 --> 02:30:47.88 apamama that's you know it's kind of a it's a similar make an island style raid they use the same
02:30:47.88 --> 02:30:56.60 submarine that they the Raiders use for making island they they it's it's kind of a textbook
02:30:56.60 --> 02:31:05.16 island raid you know navy and marine core cooperation but after after that they they don't really
02:31:05.16 --> 02:31:10.76 do much until the battle of Okanawa and the reason that they're important is because they're kind of
02:31:10.76 --> 02:31:17.80 once the UDT are created you can see how important the UDT become and how less important every
02:31:17.80 --> 02:31:23.48 other unit becomes and at one point the back re-con company doesn't really have a mission so they
02:31:23.48 --> 02:31:27.80 assign them to the UDTs and so they take every marine that's in the back re-con company that can swim
02:31:28.68 --> 02:31:35.32 and they plug them into a UDT do they actually get transferred to the navy or no no they don't get
02:31:35.32 --> 02:31:41.32 transferred and by Okanawa they they separate themselves from the UDT again and they're back
02:31:41.32 --> 02:31:45.96 to doing their sort of island raids but until Okanawa there's not a lot of other like little
02:31:45.96 --> 02:31:53.32 satellite islands to do the things that they they were trained to do and then what about the USS
02:31:53.32 --> 02:32:05.72 Burfish recon of of YAP this was a UDT UDT 10 operation what was going on there yeah that was one of the um
02:32:06.76 --> 02:32:16.12 that's in August of 44 there's a series of sort of secret um reconnaissance so after the Tinian
02:32:16.12 --> 02:32:23.08 reconnaissance which draper coffin leads um it's a it's a combined reconnaissance between uh back
02:32:23.08 --> 02:32:31.64 recon so the marine recon and UDT swimmers um the navy really sees the potential of doing these
02:32:31.64 --> 02:32:39.08 night secret reconnaissance of various islands so the next group of islands that the uh uh specific
02:32:39.08 --> 02:32:45.56 planners are hoping to capture are in the pull out so pelaloo that whole episode in the war so one
02:32:45.56 --> 02:32:54.60 of the satellite islands of pelaloo is this island of YAP and uh so the USS Burfish with a contingent
02:32:54.60 --> 02:33:03.48 of UDT swimmers half of whom are uh not haven't really been trained in the traditional UDT curriculum
02:33:03.48 --> 02:33:10.52 which they established at Maui but um half of them are actually OSS maritime swimmers they send a
02:33:10.52 --> 02:33:17.000 combined uh recon team ashore at YAP uh three of the swimmers get separated from their boat the boat
02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:22.44 ends up paddling back to the uh the U.S. at Burfish which is the submarine uh they come back
02:33:22.44 --> 02:33:27.56 out the next night trying to recover uh the swimmers hoping that they've managed to stay alive ashore
02:33:27.56 --> 02:33:32.44 and not get captured um but they uh after the second night they realized they're not going to be
02:33:32.44 --> 02:33:39.32 able to have a link up and uh three swimmers get left behind and they are three they're the as far
02:33:39.32 --> 02:33:44.52 as I know they're the only three missing um well there's there's a couple of others but um
02:33:44.52 --> 02:33:49.000 they're three on accountant for and SW members out there we still have not recovered their bodies
02:33:50.28 --> 02:33:58.76 we think um based off of the research of one uh archivist at uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
02:33:58.76 --> 02:34:03.88 the national archives uh who's also uh Moonlight says a historian himself named patch he's put together a
02:34:03.88 --> 02:34:10.20 pretty uh pretty convincing argument the the bodies are probably a bubble through app um they're
02:34:10.20 --> 02:34:16.52 buried with uh handful of other uh captured American aviators but we have not not found them there's
02:34:16.52 --> 02:34:20.60 an effort right now uh by project recover uh to try and track their bodies down
02:34:24.04 --> 02:34:30.84 alright um but like likely they were captured they were bounced around the Japanese tried to
02:34:30.84 --> 02:34:35.64 you know do a cover up of their execution they said that they were put on a transport uh
02:34:35.64 --> 02:34:40.92 bound for the South Pacific back to the Philippines uh based off of the research the night patch
02:34:40.92 --> 02:34:43.88 did it looks like that was all just manufactured and they were killed right there
02:34:45.56 --> 02:34:51.88 so that that chapter kind of kind of brings the the underwater demolition teams sort of how
02:34:51.88 --> 02:34:56.28 how we really got the traction going on the underwater demolition team's and then in chapter six
02:34:56.28 --> 02:35:04.36 you start going into just the the uh totally different aspect of warfare i mean a totally
02:35:04.36 --> 02:35:10.52 different aspect of warfare chapter six is called the contest for gorilla war in China and the
02:35:10.52 --> 02:35:19.16 organization that had no damn business fighting it the US Navy's army of soldiers and this is definitely
02:35:19.16 --> 02:35:27.56 one of the wildest um sections in the book all pretty much sentinel centered around this this guy
02:35:27.56 --> 02:35:36.04 miles um who this is like a whole book onto itself of course i guess i say that over again
02:35:36.04 --> 02:35:42.52 for all your characters but this guy's insane no i mean i literally at the end i guess he is insane right
02:35:42.52 --> 02:35:51.000 i mean the effort breaks him it completely breaks him he's uh he's committed uh to a mental
02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:57.48 institution uh it takes him several months to and part of that's drug induced i mean he's self
02:35:57.48 --> 02:36:02.52 medicating by the end of the war um taking an incredible uh cocktail worth of medicine just
02:36:02.52 --> 02:36:08.20 to you know either stay awake go to sleep and then uh deal with the the pain uh that he's
02:36:08.20 --> 02:36:13.40 deal with the in the fever too he's got almost constant malaria throughout the entire war but yeah i
02:36:13.40 --> 02:36:19.80 mean of all the guys that i i mean i say there's kind of a um uh a horse race uh in my head for who
02:36:19.80 --> 02:36:24.60 is the weirdest character in the war and miles is definitely leaning for the tape i mean he's like
02:36:25.80 --> 02:36:32.76 yeah i mean he's he's fascinating in um in the sense of how unremarkable he seems like when you meet
02:36:32.76 --> 02:36:37.08 miles like he seems like any other ship officer that you would encounter just like a few
02:36:37.08 --> 02:36:42.12 you know did a visit or any of the you know uh other guys you know he's he's not a physical
02:36:42.12 --> 02:36:48.04 specimen he's kind of you know nerdy looking he's just forgettable he's totally forgettable he's not like
02:36:48.68 --> 02:36:55.64 he's not like a exotic person he's not like uh he's not like a Lawrence of Arabia type character at all
02:36:55.64 --> 02:37:00.60 and yet he does every i mean what he contributes to the war is every bit as remarkable as
02:37:00.60 --> 02:37:04.28 as a Lawrence of Arabia yeah i mean we we were on over the figures on the last time you were on
02:37:04.28 --> 02:37:08.76 this podcast but he ended that there this massive gorilla force that he ends up running
02:37:08.76 --> 02:37:12.68 with no business doing with no business doing that and that's what that's from the title
02:37:12.68 --> 02:37:16.76 no damn business that comes from another navy officer one of miles friends he's like
02:37:16.76 --> 02:37:22.52 we have no damn business doing that i found the letter like if if you know one of miles
02:37:22.52 --> 02:37:27.32 as friends thinks that you know we the navy has no damn business then what hope did we really
02:37:27.32 --> 02:37:32.36 ever have yeah and yet the impact that they had was completely strategic they end up killing
02:37:32.36 --> 02:37:37.88 um someone in the neighborhood of twenty five thousand i think enemy japanese soldiers but more
02:37:37.88 --> 02:37:45.40 important tying up a million of them but only lost a handful of Americans i doesn't account for
02:37:45.40 --> 02:37:50.76 the number of chinese lost i mean yeah but yeah right i mean the the chinese contribution is you know
02:37:50.76 --> 02:37:57.32 it's unaccounted for and you know significant but yeah only i some six six american
02:37:57.32 --> 02:38:02.12 uh six american deaths in the entire effort which is a you know the effort you know stretches
02:38:02.12 --> 02:38:08.04 from nineteen forty two to all the way to nineteen forty five i mean it's it's absolutely right
02:38:08.04 --> 02:38:11.32 there should be a book written about this and when i when i got into this i didn't want to
02:38:11.32 --> 02:38:16.92 write this chapter i was so tired of not so tired but i was like i was so anxious to be done with
02:38:16.92 --> 02:38:21.72 world war two when i finished my UDT chapter and i was so ready to move on to Korea i just want
02:38:21.72 --> 02:38:26.76 a different scenery different a different a record group with the national archives uh when i got
02:38:26.76 --> 02:38:29.96 to this point what i mean all i wanted to do is leave and i was just trying to like
02:38:30.68 --> 02:38:35.80 take this china stuff and kind of stuff it into like an introductory section of my Korean war
02:38:35.80 --> 02:38:40.28 chapter and i couldn't do it one chapter or one page became two pages and became three pages and
02:38:40.28 --> 02:38:46.12 four pages and i'm like mother mother had to write a whole new chapter and derailed my entire timeline
02:38:46.12 --> 02:38:51.96 for you know finishing the book what's the movie potential for uh for this for this i think that
02:38:51.96 --> 02:38:56.92 i mean i think you know if you have to if i was gonna say like which of these i think they
02:38:56.92 --> 02:39:02.44 could all be movies but you know if you haven't seen we've seen you know say we're private Ryan
02:39:04.92 --> 02:39:12.76 we've never seen a uh a representation of a real war like what happened in china and world
02:39:12.76 --> 02:39:18.28 war two it could totally it miles as such a you know interestingly an interesting character he could
02:39:18.28 --> 02:39:25.64 be like i mean he's interesting in the fact that he's so boring but he does i mean he's i mean
02:39:25.64 --> 02:39:32.52 survives 40 assassination attempts he's uh he's a naval officer who's involved and and probably
02:39:32.52 --> 02:39:38.60 more ground combat than anybody else uh in history yeah including a freaking cavalry charge on
02:39:38.60 --> 02:39:44.60 camels yeah it's nuts it's nuts the whole thing is nuts but yeah that the movie potential of
02:39:44.60 --> 02:39:49.40 chapter six is high i think the movie potential of you know the UDD chapter is just as high too
02:39:49.40 --> 02:39:55.88 i mean that's i mean the i mean the emergency or i i can see a movie of you know these guys you
02:39:55.88 --> 02:40:01.72 know totally you know going into battle with just knives and you know fins and masks let me
02:40:01.72 --> 02:40:07.80 pretty need you have another character that you bring in here uh going to the book at 60 years old
02:40:07.80 --> 02:40:13.64 thick jowled and with white hair parted just off center wild build dawn event a nickname he had
02:40:13.64 --> 02:40:19.16 earned as a volunteer leading soldiers through mud gas and death on the western front looked in
02:40:19.16 --> 02:40:26.44 his uniform nothing like the head of an insatiable unconventional warfare organization and more
02:40:26.44 --> 02:40:34.44 like an overweight toddler playing dress up for signs of the former one had to look elsewhere first
02:40:34.44 --> 02:40:41.88 to his left breast where he had humbly affects a single ribbon his metal of honor in effect saying
02:40:41.88 --> 02:40:48.12 to his peers that no other awards mattered and second to a career as an attorney as a new
02:40:48.12 --> 02:40:53.48 York attorney and politician occupations that it introduced him to everyone from movie stars to
02:40:53.48 --> 02:40:58.44 Mussolini and taking him farther around the world than most presidents he had been to cyber
02:40:58.44 --> 02:41:03.40 it aside as a bolster vix to the far east a hunt down business Ethiopia to toward the Italian
02:41:03.40 --> 02:41:10.44 front the balklands turkey and Spain as a presidential presidents unofficial envoy in past ages
02:41:10.44 --> 02:41:15.80 a hero milionaire like donovan could have responded to a world crisis simply by raising his own
02:41:15.80 --> 02:41:22.52 regiment equipping it and leading it into battle in the 20th century such impulses had been curbed by the
02:41:22.52 --> 02:41:28.28 increasing complexities of modern warfare and a corresponding bureaucracy that recognized the limited
02:41:28.28 --> 02:41:35.40 value of eccentric amateurs metal of honor not now blocked from commanding regular troops donovan
02:41:35.40 --> 02:41:42.20 courageous entrepreneurial imaginative and most of all unstoppable had set his sights on the
02:41:42.20 --> 02:41:50.04 only field of action whose battle lines had not yet been drawn and on the one man who stood in his way
02:41:53.24 --> 02:42:01.40 what's up with donovan dude well it's an it's an impossible contest i mean
02:42:01.40 --> 02:42:09.40 donovan is when i when i set out to write this not this chapter but when i i i set out to write
02:42:09.40 --> 02:42:18.20 an OSS chapter and i i was attracted to it just because of donovan he is a i mean there should be a
02:42:18.20 --> 02:42:25.80 donovan movie he's i mean all the you know the stories about jad or Hoover you know dressing up
02:42:25.80 --> 02:42:33.72 women's clothes these are rumors that donovan started i mean he's responsible for so much and
02:42:33.72 --> 02:42:38.12 you know what when you say that you mean he actually was responsible for starting the rumors about jad
02:42:38.12 --> 02:42:43.40 or Hoover jump dressing up in women's clothing he yes that's what we're saying i'm saying yes he is
02:42:43.40 --> 02:42:48.84 responsible i'm not saying that this isn't hypervaly this is what this guy did no in the reason he did
02:42:48.84 --> 02:42:56.04 that is because at the time the OSS and the FBI were in some sort of competition for the international
02:42:56.04 --> 02:43:01.48 intelligence mission and one of the two across dresser he wanted to delegitimize his rival is
02:43:01.48 --> 02:43:09.16 best as he could i mean and and at the same time jad grouver was he was putting rumors out there
02:43:09.16 --> 02:43:14.04 that donovan was having an affair with his daughter and law so they were both at each other from like
02:43:14.04 --> 02:43:17.48 so is there any truth through the rumor of jad grouver dressing up in women's clothing i don't know
02:43:17.48 --> 02:43:21.16 about that but i think there is suspicion that donovan was actually having an affair with his daughter
02:43:21.16 --> 02:43:27.40 and law that's not the life yeah that's that's pretty uh and so how does he play into our
02:43:27.40 --> 02:43:32.20 story here for for the development of the seal teams so donovan's important because donovan
02:43:32.20 --> 02:43:37.08 sees what the navy's doing in china any once it he doesn't think the navy should have anything to
02:43:37.08 --> 02:43:42.76 do with this uh donovan has established himself as the uh the head of the international or head
02:43:42.76 --> 02:43:49.72 of the u.s intelligence organization which he has understood uh to include all sorts of special
02:43:49.72 --> 02:43:55.40 programs um so if there's going to be a guerrilla warfare effort in china o s s is going to be
02:43:55.40 --> 02:44:04.12 in charge of it so he comes to china um so first uh he tries to uh rope miles into the o s s and
02:44:04.12 --> 02:44:10.76 he establishes miles as an o s s not operative but uh head of an o s s program problem is um
02:44:10.76 --> 02:44:20.28 um donovan also wants to send all of his uh o s s folks uh to support so soko um but miles
02:44:21.24 --> 02:44:28.12 miles starts to receive these guys and they're all you know um a lot of these guys are you know
02:44:28.12 --> 02:44:32.04 they're you know pretty interesting guys but miles doesn't want anything to do with them
02:44:32.04 --> 02:44:36.52 they're like wannabes i get that it's for the wannabes it's for like they because because
02:44:36.52 --> 02:44:41.80 of his mile boondoggers he was who miles is getting is marine co officers like primarily right
02:44:41.80 --> 02:44:45.40 he's getting marine co officers in the beginning but what he really wants are people that don't
02:44:45.40 --> 02:44:52.76 know anything about china he doesn't want racist uh miles is um that weird he's the peculiar
02:44:52.76 --> 02:44:58.28 type of officer who actually he likes the the indigenous people that he's working with he doesn't
02:44:58.28 --> 02:45:05.48 want them to um i mean he's he's a perfect character for you know you know today but at the time
02:45:05.48 --> 02:45:10.12 like nobody really understands like what's his hang up he he's in fact you wait with china he's
02:45:10.12 --> 02:45:17.64 in fact we were with the chinese he thinks that these are uh uh you know members of the most you know
02:45:17.64 --> 02:45:25.08 one of the most civilized um you know uh countries on the planet um and he uh has a respect for
02:45:25.08 --> 02:45:33.16 them in a way that other america does don't um he he totally rejects uh the the orientalism or the
02:45:33.16 --> 02:45:40.84 uh the the superior american idea in that way he's he's just like you know teelorns i mean he's
02:45:41.48 --> 02:45:48.28 he's a believer he's the worst kind of person and so i mean he's like he actually my worst worst kind
02:45:48.28 --> 02:45:58.28 of person i'm really joking he's like um to other people he's uh he's not pliable he's um um he really
02:45:58.28 --> 02:46:04.04 believes in the potential of these uh uh chinese soldiers to tie the japanese down or to actually attack
02:46:04.04 --> 02:46:08.92 them and you know donovan comes in and donovan's a manipulator donovan's been manipulating for
02:46:08.92 --> 02:46:15.56 years um he's he you know managed to he he's world himself uh into positions his entire uh you know
02:46:15.56 --> 02:46:21.48 since since he got that metal of honor he's used it to you know plow pathways through your bureaucracy
02:46:22.52 --> 02:46:28.12 and to create a unit that never should have been created to create the so as that and to and some of
02:46:28.12 --> 02:46:32.36 his schemes are completely hair-bright um but some of them are not some of them are actually you know
02:46:32.36 --> 02:46:37.32 pretty good so he when he sees donovan he's trying or when he when donovan sees miles he first
02:46:37.32 --> 02:46:43.08 wants to you know put miles under his thumb and when miles can't be put under his thumb he tries to
02:46:43.08 --> 02:46:46.76 take the whole thing and leave miles with the weather stations that's all he wants to leave miles
02:46:46.76 --> 02:46:52.12 with he wants to take this entire guerrilla army that miles is starting to build um and he just
02:46:52.12 --> 02:46:57.000 ifies that because miles is some you know like like quote in the book he's not putting scouts other barrel
02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:04.04 had fast enough and he almost does it he gets real close but the thing that stops him is the
02:47:04.04 --> 02:47:10.84 Chinese won't work with Donovan but they do like miles they can smell the intent yeah right
02:47:10.84 --> 02:47:18.12 absolutely Donovan is freaking shady it's tough to you know I mean he has he's got to be shady a little
02:47:18.12 --> 02:47:23.56 he is I mean he you know it's tough to not you know respect out of and he's he's a character like
02:47:25.08 --> 02:47:34.52 and he you know but he's a he's a he's a toddler with a with a flamethrower all right can we go back real quick
02:47:34.52 --> 02:47:40.68 there's two characters that I want to talk about from the UDT I think that okay hit him Alan Gordon
02:47:40.68 --> 02:47:51.96 Leslie I was I was thinking about the contribution of other other branches of service to the UDTs
02:47:51.96 --> 02:47:58.76 Alan Gordon Leslie is a marine that gets attached to seal tea earth to UDT five he becomes
02:47:58.76 --> 02:48:07.96 draper coughman's executive officer of UDT five for the Battle of Sipan he is he's Canadian
02:48:07.96 --> 02:48:13.16 and I was thinking about him the other day because we're here in San Diego and I was walking
02:48:13.16 --> 02:48:19.24 through the hotel del and I was looking at this you know monument to you know Victorian architecture
02:48:19.24 --> 02:48:26.04 and everything and it was there you know during World War II and Gordon Leslie he goes through the
02:48:26.04 --> 02:48:33.40 entire war he he's one of the scout snipers who ceases the pier at Tara he shoulders a a flamethrower
02:48:33.40 --> 02:48:38.84 and assaults the entire pier so that there's this there's this pier you know cutting into the
02:48:38.84 --> 02:48:45.48 the lagoon that Tara and that that that pier would have threatened to cut into the flank of the
02:48:45.48 --> 02:48:49.72 the Marines that were landing on the beach so the Marines had to take it before they landed so they
02:48:49.72 --> 02:48:54.12 sent a scout sniper put him to do it and Gordon Leslie was the guy with the flamethrower he's fighting
02:48:54.12 --> 02:48:58.84 all you know pillbox to pillbox or the in placement to in placement and you know you know
02:48:58.84 --> 02:49:04.12 using the the flamethrower to destroy guys well he's got a machine gunner to his left and they're
02:49:04.12 --> 02:49:11.32 going down this incrementally taking the entire pier he survives the Battle of Tara and it becomes
02:49:11.32 --> 02:49:18.52 a he volunteer for the UDT as sort of a Marine Corlie's on but he falls in love with the UDT
02:49:18.52 --> 02:49:23.64 and manages to stay with them and the Marine Coral completely loses track of me they don't know
02:49:23.64 --> 02:49:29.32 where he is they think they think he's a casualty he stays with UDT five throughout the remainder of
02:49:29.32 --> 02:49:36.52 the war and when he ends the war he tries to transfer from the officially transfer from the Marine
02:49:36.52 --> 02:49:41.24 Coral to the UDT he wants to stay with the frogman that becomes so controversial it goes all the way
02:49:41.24 --> 02:49:46.52 up to the common dot to the Marine Coral and Marines say we're not losing a Marine to the Navy
02:49:46.52 --> 02:49:52.04 especially to the UDT we're we're gonna keep him so he's entitled to like $4,000 for the back
02:49:52.04 --> 02:50:00.44 pay it because he hasn't gotten three years so in in retaliation he takes his $4,000 he goes to the
02:50:00.44 --> 02:50:06.60 hotel del he slaps that $4,000 on the on the front desk reserves a peninsula of rooms
02:50:07.40 --> 02:50:14.84 in the del and he throws a two week bender it's so bad the Draper Kaufman has to put up a watch
02:50:14.84 --> 02:50:21.24 bill of officers to make sure that his frogman don't leave that wing of the hotel.
02:50:23.56 --> 02:50:26.12 Good times and who's the other guy you wanted to bring up?
02:50:26.12 --> 02:50:35.56 Normons are uh C. Moro and Scamander C. Moro and so one of the one of the the great
02:50:35.56 --> 02:50:39.40 things about you know doing the research for this book is you get to discover all of the
02:50:39.40 --> 02:50:44.20 uh the characters that weren't seals or that weren't frogman that contributed to the
02:50:45.24 --> 02:50:50.12 the importance or the the success of naval special warfare and one of those one of those
02:50:50.12 --> 02:50:55.72 that's always stood out to me is Commander C. Moro and he was a destroyer skipper
02:50:58.60 --> 02:51:05.56 and he was involved in the the fire support mission prior to the invasion of Tenian.
02:51:05.56 --> 02:51:13.40 So Tenian is the greatest strategic um battle probably of the entire central Pacific
02:51:13.40 --> 02:51:19.64 uh campaign. It's the island that ultimately becomes the uh um the airfield
02:51:20.20 --> 02:51:25.48 that they uh you know fly all the uh long range bombers to to bomb Japan on.
02:51:26.60 --> 02:51:31.32 That's it's where the anologate takes off from uh to bomb Japan it's it's a perfect
02:51:31.32 --> 02:51:38.20 uh table top island um but before it can be that it has to be taken and one of the the biggest
02:51:39.24 --> 02:51:44.44 coups of the war is Draper Coffman's reconnaissance of the of the beaches that uh nobody ever thought
02:51:44.44 --> 02:51:49.88 anybody could land on but in order to sell that in order to land all those troops on those
02:51:49.88 --> 02:51:57.24 uh beaches that nobody expects uh UDT7 has to stage this elaborate um ruse uh on the south of the island
02:51:57.24 --> 02:52:05.16 uh uh at Tenian town and so um on the day of the actual invasion when all the
02:52:05.16 --> 02:52:11.48 Marines are secretly sneaking into the uh the beaches of the Draper Coffman has found um the UDT7
02:52:11.48 --> 02:52:17.80 is you know conducting a daylight you know reconnaissance and they're protected by you know multiple
02:52:17.80 --> 02:52:23.000 battleships one being the USS Colorado and I'm like Colorado has lighted self up um a midships
02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:31.24 or uh uh uh with a broadside uh to the beach um and it takes devastating um uh nail gunfire
02:52:31.24 --> 02:52:37.56 uh shore gunfire um and the guns are knocked out and the suddenly uh all the swimmers of UDT7 are

02:56:19.32 --> 02:56:28.68 our lives into this into buying the equipment capturing the know how you know you talk about
02:56:28.68 --> 02:56:34.36 how some of the people that you would you have interviewed that have since died uh and and you
02:56:34.36 --> 02:56:37.80 wouldn't have been able to capture the knowledge we've actually had that happened at origin people
02:56:37.80 --> 02:56:42.04 that the old timers and i mean that with all due respect the old timers the people that
02:56:42.04 --> 02:56:45.40 knew how to run a loom that people that knew how to work on machines that people that knew how to
02:56:45.40 --> 02:56:52.04 weave and knit they they passed this information out some of them were losing them now so

02:57:47.56 --> 02:57:52.52 is you know the obviously primary goal is to make sure it's effective but we were able to make it
02:57:52.52 --> 02:57:59.72 effective been while still giving a little bit of a of a shout out or not to the tiger
02:57:59.72 --> 02:58:04.92 strott to the tiger stripes so you know one we got one for the one for the highlands sort of the

03:01:21.16 --> 03:01:26.92 that you were in the seal teams is you have a perspective that that comes through that an
03:01:26.92 --> 03:01:32.76 authenticity that comes through it's just a phenomenal book so by water beneath the walls

03:05:41.20 --> 03:05:45.20 It happened one piece of dirt at a time
03:05:45.20 --> 03:05:48.20 to build up into something that's worthwhile.
03:05:48.20 --> 03:05:50.20 That's the way life is.
03:05:50.20 --> 03:05:53.20 And the only way that happens is if you go out there
03:05:53.20 --> 03:05:55.20 and get after it.
