00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.58
This is Jocco podcast number 26 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:11.68 --> 00:00:18.08
O for a voice like thunder and a tongue to drown the throat of war.

3
00:00:19.36 --> 00:00:24.48
When the senses are shaken and the soul is driven to madness who can stand

4
00:00:24.48 --> 00:00:32.88
when the souls of the oppressed fight in the troubled air that rages who can stand.

5
00:00:34.24 --> 00:00:38.40
When the whirlwind of fury comes from the throne of God,

6
00:00:39.60 --> 00:00:46.08
when the frowns of his countenance drive the nations together who can stand.

7
00:00:46.08 --> 00:00:56.32
When sin claps his broad wings over the battle and sails rejoicing in the flood of death,

8
00:00:57.60 --> 00:01:04.88
when souls are torn to everlasting fire and feans of hell rejoice upon the slain.

9
00:01:04.88 --> 00:01:18.88
O who can stand. Good evening echo. Good evening.

10
00:01:21.36 --> 00:01:27.68
That right there is a little excerpt of a poem by a guy named William Blake.

11
00:01:27.68 --> 00:01:46.72
And it paints war as something so powerful, so evil, something superhuman.

12
00:01:50.72 --> 00:01:56.32
In the full poem is really a statement against a born-a-g, as it goes on and it's not that much

13
00:01:56.32 --> 00:02:03.28
longer but it blames war on the politicians and on the kings and on the nobles and it blames

14
00:02:03.28 --> 00:02:10.80
war on the religious leaders. But he asked that question over and over again who can stand.

15
00:02:16.40 --> 00:02:18.24
And I can actually answer that question.

16
00:02:18.24 --> 00:02:29.04
And I've seen who can stand. I've seen people break but I have seen many brave men and women

17
00:02:29.04 --> 00:02:38.16
on the battlefield stand. Stand against fear and death and stand against evil.

18
00:02:38.16 --> 00:02:51.44
Stand as sin claps his broad wings over the battle and sails rejoicing in the flood of death.

19
00:02:55.68 --> 00:03:02.72
And that's William Blake. Those are his words but he's writing that in the late 1700s and early 1800s.

20
00:03:02.72 --> 00:03:15.52
He had no idea how bad war would get. And I'm not saying war is worse in terms of individual

21
00:03:15.52 --> 00:03:22.48
horror but in terms of scale, it can't be denied. I mean world war one in world war two, the scale of

22
00:03:22.48 --> 00:03:31.68
horror, it would be incomprehensible to a man from Blake's time. He just couldn't understand it.

23
00:03:38.48 --> 00:03:43.68
So let's go to June 6, 1944.

24
00:03:43.68 --> 00:04:00.08
As the demon spread his wings over the beaches of Normandy and man stood against his evil.

25
00:04:00.08 --> 00:04:13.92
The English cocks and tried to drop the ramp a couple hundred feet from the shore when

26
00:04:13.92 --> 00:04:20.80
the sergeant ordered. Take us all the way in. Just then machine guns opened up and bullets

27
00:04:20.80 --> 00:04:27.04
tore through the wooden sides of the landing craft. Wounding four or five men, men began screaming,

28
00:04:27.04 --> 00:04:33.84
opened the damn doors. Just as the ramp went down there was a pause in the incoming fire.

29
00:04:33.84 --> 00:04:39.52
We exited fast diving into the water and holding on. Sergeant Tron was lying next to me when

30
00:04:39.52 --> 00:04:44.88
he was shot through the wrist. I crawled over to him and gave him first aid. We just let the

31
00:04:44.88 --> 00:04:51.04
tide wash over the lower portion of our bodies using our fingernails to pull forward, inch by inch

32
00:04:51.04 --> 00:04:57.36
to keep from drowning. I looked back at our assault craft and both English sailors were dead.

33
00:04:58.72 --> 00:05:05.28
They were heroes and paid the price for getting us in. They risked their safety to get us closer to

34
00:05:05.28 --> 00:05:17.36
shore. Private Thomas McCarter was the first fatality in our sector. His cries to me for help

35
00:05:17.36 --> 00:05:24.32
still haunt me. Waded down and possibly wounded. He frantically struggled in the water as he cried

36
00:05:24.32 --> 00:05:30.96
my name, but I couldn't get to him. It was drilled into us that we must push forward to the objective

37
00:05:30.96 --> 00:05:37.20
and to let the medics take care of the wounded. We were subjected to grazing fire from Chris

38
00:05:37.20 --> 00:05:43.52
costing fire from machine guns. I believed at the time that it would be better for me to push

39
00:05:43.52 --> 00:05:50.56
forward since Tom was quite far away. These machine guns kept firing until we got to the sea wall.

40
00:05:53.76 --> 00:05:57.44
Tom was my friend and I should have tried to save him.

41
00:06:01.36 --> 00:06:07.44
It took individual riflemen using grenades, satchel charges and bayonets to neutralize the

42
00:06:07.44 --> 00:06:14.80
almost impregnable concrete bunkers. I didn't see any rangers until later. In my opinion,

43
00:06:14.80 --> 00:06:19.68
the air force and navy made it possible for us to hang on until reinforcements and more equipment

44
00:06:19.68 --> 00:06:24.40
arrived. They also kept the Germans from mounting an armored counter attack.

45
00:06:24.40 --> 00:06:34.88
But you know, it boils down to the bloody foot soldier and his rifle to hold on to the real estate.

46
00:06:39.20 --> 00:06:47.20
That right there was private first class ran off a gentleman company d

47
00:06:47.20 --> 00:06:57.60
116th infantry 27 years old, d 27 years old on d day, a mortar gunner.

48
00:07:02.08 --> 00:07:09.76
Now we're going to hear from private first class George A. Kobe company d 116th infantry.

49
00:07:09.76 --> 00:07:18.56
600 yards from the shore, the English cox and lost his nerve and slowed the engine.

50
00:07:19.36 --> 00:07:23.92
This improved the Germans opportunity to hit our boat. Captain's shielding was looking

51
00:07:23.92 --> 00:07:28.64
through the vision slit. Look back at the sailor and said, you're not going to drop that ramp here.

52
00:07:29.60 --> 00:07:32.40
Technical sergeant Stinett was standing next to the captain.

53
00:07:33.68 --> 00:07:38.88
Suddenly an 88 millimeter hit the ramp directly, blowing captain's shielding blackward,

54
00:07:38.88 --> 00:07:44.64
killing him instantly. Part of the ramp caught Stinett's left eye knocking it out.

55
00:07:47.12 --> 00:07:54.32
With John Sefko, Vic Cremone and Eugene Adrian, we finally made it to the sea wall.

56
00:07:55.20 --> 00:08:03.20
How I'll never know. It was the worst fire I was ever subjected to in all of my combat.

57
00:08:03.20 --> 00:08:14.16
Now we've got private first class Robert L. sales company B 116th infantry.

58
00:08:16.64 --> 00:08:19.92
Join the Virginia National Guard at age 15.

59
00:08:25.28 --> 00:08:30.16
About 100 yards from the shore, the English cox and said he couldn't get us any closer.

60
00:08:30.16 --> 00:08:36.72
As the ramp lowered, enemy machine guns opened up, firing directly into our boat.

61
00:08:38.64 --> 00:08:44.88
Like all great leaders, Captain Zap was the first off the boat and the first one to get hit.

62
00:08:46.32 --> 00:08:51.84
Staff Sergeant Dick Wright was second and also hit falling into the water.

63
00:08:53.04 --> 00:08:57.04
A medic was third and I didn't see what happened to him. I was fourth.

64
00:08:57.04 --> 00:09:04.48
I caught my heel in the ramp and fell sideways out of the path of that MG 42 undoubtedly saving my life.

65
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.60
All of the men that followed were either killed by Germans or drowned.

66
00:09:11.12 --> 00:09:13.36
No one from my craft was ever found alive.

67
00:09:18.48 --> 00:09:23.60
The captain screamed, I'm hit. I tried to get to him, but he was lost in the surf.

68
00:09:23.60 --> 00:09:29.68
Men were all around me in the water bleeding from wounds and screaming for help.

69
00:09:30.64 --> 00:09:33.76
I knew the boat was the target so I got away from it as fast as I could.

70
00:09:35.28 --> 00:09:41.60
One of the first things I did was shed my SCR 300 radio and my assault jacket.

71
00:09:42.16 --> 00:09:45.60
That radio was heavy and I suppose it's still at the bottom of the channel.

72
00:09:45.60 --> 00:09:52.72
Mortar and artillery shells were landing all around and one hit so close that it knocked me groggy.

73
00:09:53.68 --> 00:09:58.88
Luckily a log floated by with an unexploded teller mine still attached.

74
00:09:59.76 --> 00:10:02.40
I grabbed hold of it until my head cleared a bit.

75
00:10:03.20 --> 00:10:08.88
I remained behind that log pushing an informe me using it as a shield as I reached dry until I reached

76
00:10:08.88 --> 00:10:14.40
dry land. The first person I saw in the beach that I recognized was Dick Wright.

77
00:10:14.40 --> 00:10:20.56
He haulered over to me that he was badly hit. I watched him trying to raise his arms,

78
00:10:21.52 --> 00:10:28.56
but a sniper spotted him and shot him through the head. His face fell into the sand never to move again.

79
00:10:30.24 --> 00:10:33.44
I didn't try to go to him because I knew he was dead.

80
00:10:35.68 --> 00:10:40.000
While pinned down on that beach I watched incoming landing craft being shot at.

81
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.08
One of them carried the battalion surgeon, Captain Robert B. Ware, a man I knew from my

82
00:10:46.08 --> 00:10:53.52
hometown of Madison Heights, Virginia. The doctor had flaming red hair. I watched him as he

83
00:10:53.52 --> 00:10:57.84
disembarked the landing craft and that machine gun opened up, cutting him down.

84
00:10:59.44 --> 00:11:04.48
When I will never forget, we're seeing his helmet fly off his head and showing all that red hair.

85
00:11:04.48 --> 00:11:09.92
I crawled on my belly using the dead and wounded as a shield.

86
00:11:11.52 --> 00:11:16.80
Sometime later I saw Max Smith from Shepherd Town, West Virginia.

87
00:11:18.56 --> 00:11:21.68
And some other B company men taking shelter behind a sea wall.

88
00:11:22.40 --> 00:11:27.52
Some of them were badly wounded. I banded Smith's eye that was lying out of his face.

89
00:11:28.32 --> 00:11:32.08
I kept crawling back to the water's edge dragging men out if they were still living.

90
00:11:32.08 --> 00:11:37.28
I didn't bother if they were dead. I pulled quite a few to safety.

91
00:11:37.68 --> 00:11:41.04
One of the medics helped to give first aid and comfort to the wounded.

92
00:11:42.80 --> 00:11:45.20
The first enemy soldier I saw was a prisoner.

93
00:11:46.32 --> 00:11:51.92
And terrorigators had him on his knees and his hands were locked behind his head.

94
00:11:53.12 --> 00:11:57.04
He didn't look so tough to me but those guys up on the cliffs were plenty tough.

95
00:11:57.04 --> 00:12:05.20
You can't imagine how helpless it was to be lying on that beach and those machine guns and sniper shooting anything that moved.

96
00:12:06.88 --> 00:12:09.92
At this point we were not sure the invasion would succeed.

97
00:12:11.20 --> 00:12:18.72
Our company was shot up so badly that there was no organization or communication from other sectors to tell us how they were doing.

98
00:12:20.08 --> 00:12:24.48
If all the landing zones were as helpless as we were, the invasion was in jeopardy.

99
00:12:24.48 --> 00:12:27.36
We felt helpless and alone.

100
00:12:29.44 --> 00:12:35.20
We had many acts of heroism from B company, men with many of them unreported.

101
00:12:36.56 --> 00:12:43.44
Lieutenant William B. Williams single-handedly with hand grenades and a rifle charged and subdued a pill box.

102
00:12:45.12 --> 00:12:51.44
Sergeant William Pears and Odeal Paget survived the landing better than we did and were able to take a few

103
00:12:51.44 --> 00:12:54.56
men up to those rocks and cliffs and fight it out with the Germans.

104
00:12:55.68 --> 00:12:59.60
It was touching go for quite some time in our sector.

105
00:13:01.44 --> 00:13:05.76
Not until St. Lofel and Jalide did we know for sure that the invasion was a success.

106
00:13:07.60 --> 00:13:12.72
D-Day was indeed the longest day but there were many many long days after that.

107
00:13:14.08 --> 00:13:18.72
Day after bloody day it was jumping over those hedgeros and men getting killed.

108
00:13:18.72 --> 00:13:27.52
We lost some very good men every single day. St. Lofel was about 25 miles from the beach and it was

109
00:13:27.52 --> 00:13:34.64
liberated on July 18th. When St. Lofel we felt confident that we were in France to stay,

110
00:13:36.08 --> 00:13:39.28
surviving the war was another story.

111
00:13:39.28 --> 00:13:56.32
So those were some excerpts right there from a book by John Robert Slotter.

112
00:13:56.96 --> 00:14:02.88
The book is called Omaha Beach and Beyond the Long March of Sergeant Bob Slotter.

113
00:14:03.44 --> 00:14:07.52
Those excerpts that I just read, they weren't Bob Slotter. They were various other people that

114
00:14:07.52 --> 00:14:16.96
worked with him that he went back and interviewed. This is another guy born in Tennessee,

115
00:14:17.44 --> 00:14:22.56
grew up in Rowan Oak, Virginia, enlisted in the Army Reserves at age 15.

116
00:14:27.20 --> 00:14:34.08
And as he's given an intro to the book here, this is what he says.

117
00:14:34.08 --> 00:14:39.36
I remember buddies with whom I spent passes to London.

118
00:14:39.36 --> 00:14:44.96
Men I played cards with a couple of days before the landing, who signed their autographs on my

119
00:14:44.96 --> 00:14:50.48
Eisenhower D. Day missive, who shook hands with me on the Javelins deck.

120
00:14:51.60 --> 00:14:59.44
Young man, young man, as I was, all killed during the largest air land and sea battle ever fought.

121
00:14:59.44 --> 00:15:08.64
Many more were maimed and never seen again. How could I forget this epic event even if I failed

122
00:15:08.64 --> 00:15:17.60
to recall the proper names and faces? Men wars are not history, but history is someone's recorded

123
00:15:17.60 --> 00:15:28.64
memory. Most of us remember noble and heroic deeds, but conveniently forget or fail to record

124
00:15:28.64 --> 00:15:37.04
the less than noble. I am no different. Many times I did and saw things that are best for gotten

125
00:15:37.04 --> 00:15:47.04
or left on written. War brings out the best and the worst in most of us. The Nazis were accused

126
00:15:47.04 --> 00:15:54.56
of killing, raping, pillaging, and burning. A few on our side were also guilty of these crimes.

127
00:15:54.56 --> 00:16:04.88
Soldiers on both sides looted for souvenirs as did I. And yet, cruel treatment of the enemy

128
00:16:04.88 --> 00:16:11.68
was an unusual occurrence. I myself am proud to say that I want saved an enemy soldier's life.

129
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.24
This book will attempt to show that ordinary men and women can do extraordinary

130
00:16:18.24 --> 00:16:25.20
feats if they believe the cause is great. Many GIs have said that they were merely fighting for

131
00:16:25.20 --> 00:16:32.72
each other. True, but I maintain another factor played in a more important role, and it can be

132
00:16:32.72 --> 00:16:42.32
summed up with one word, pride. Regardless of their motives, I saw very few cowards in the

133
00:16:42.32 --> 00:16:48.96
116th Infantry Regiment, made God bless the many, many more heroes.

134
00:16:51.52 --> 00:17:01.20
Yeah, this is one of those books where I don't have a lot to add in some of these situations.

135
00:17:01.20 --> 00:17:14.80
Now, Bob Slotter was his nickname Bob Slotter, and when he got to England, they actually took

136
00:17:14.80 --> 00:17:20.000
him and a bunch of other soldiers and they formed him into a new unit called the 29th Rangers.

137
00:17:20.64 --> 00:17:28.72
And they trained these guys ultra hard. They did all kinds of stuff for 11 months getting ready

138
00:17:28.72 --> 00:17:35.84
for the invasion. These 29th Rangers, they did marching in mountain climbing in a crazy obstacle course.

139
00:17:36.40 --> 00:17:44.32
They trained in unarmed combat. They did log PT, cold weather training. I mean, just grueling training.

140
00:17:45.44 --> 00:17:52.80
And at the end of all that harsh training for a number of reasons, they actually disbanded

141
00:17:52.80 --> 00:17:58.16
this group, and they sent them all back with their regular units. So they had a group of guys that

142
00:17:58.16 --> 00:18:03.68
got trained super hard, you know, like what we would consider a modern sort of special operation

143
00:18:03.68 --> 00:18:09.20
selection course. They went through that, but then when they got done with this training,

144
00:18:09.20 --> 00:18:15.68
and they were getting ready for the actual invasion, they took them dispersed them amongst the regular

145
00:18:15.68 --> 00:18:25.36
troops. And the guy that ran this training for the 29th Rangers was a guy named major mill

146
00:18:25.36 --> 00:18:32.24
Holland. And he sent a letter to his daughter, and this is what he wrote. And this is after these guys

147
00:18:32.24 --> 00:18:40.80
got disbanded. He said, every boy should be made to play football and box and participate in all

148
00:18:40.80 --> 00:18:47.20
kinds of athletics. And above all, the Americans should be taught discipline and decent living.

149
00:18:49.04 --> 00:18:54.80
Then he should be given a year of the toughest kind of military training, not the kind that we know,

150
00:18:54.80 --> 00:19:01.76
but the kind I gave my Rangers. God, I wish I had those boys now. We would tear the German

151
00:19:01.76 --> 00:19:09.84
stringy. I hear of those boys now and then, and although they are almost all gone now,

152
00:19:09.84 --> 00:19:15.84
they have done unbelievable things in our spoken of almost in a tone of reverence by officers and

153
00:19:15.84 --> 00:19:28.40
men alike who have fought with them, they were men trained and trained hard and learned about

154
00:19:28.40 --> 00:19:37.76
discipline. The parents out there get your kids training, sports, decent living.

155
00:19:37.76 --> 00:19:50.56
That's how you make men. Now, fast-forwarding, because they went back to their regular army units

156
00:19:51.52 --> 00:19:58.80
and they continued to train and prepared for the invasion. And Bob Slotters assigned to

157
00:19:58.80 --> 00:20:08.96
D Company, 116th Infantry Division. And I'm fast-forwarding right now, straight to D Day,

158
00:20:09.68 --> 00:20:13.76
straight to his perception of D Day and what it was like for him.

159
00:20:19.36 --> 00:20:24.08
You know, this is all that training that these guys have been through

160
00:20:24.08 --> 00:20:34.000
and none of them had been the car of that before. So this is it. Their first operation is D Day.

161
00:20:38.96 --> 00:20:45.36
And this is what it's like back to the book about 150 yards from the shore,

162
00:20:45.36 --> 00:20:50.000
despite the warning from someone behind me to keep your head down, I cautiously peeped up.

163
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.88
I could see that craft that the craft about 25 yards to a right and a couple of hundred yards ahead

164
00:20:56.88 --> 00:21:01.92
were targeted by small arms. Firing, tracing, trace or bullets skipped off,

165
00:21:02.72 --> 00:21:06.88
skipped and bounced off the ramp and sides as they zeroed in before the ramps fell.

166
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.16
I said to anyone close enough to hear above the bed them. Men, we are going to catch hell,

167
00:21:14.16 --> 00:21:22.48
be ready. Then it began to happen. Enemy artillery and mortar shells sent great

168
00:21:22.48 --> 00:21:29.84
plumes of water spouting skyward as they exploded in the water. Near Mrs. Rainedus with sea water,

169
00:21:30.48 --> 00:21:34.24
I suddenly became very worried about what Jerry would do to us.

170
00:21:35.84 --> 00:21:42.48
How in the hell did those sons of bitches survive what we thought was a carpet bombing and un-shelling

171
00:21:42.48 --> 00:21:50.56
of the beach? At Slapped in Sands, we trained with live explosions but these were far more frightening.

172
00:21:51.52 --> 00:21:54.96
This time they were shooting to kill every one of us.

173
00:21:57.20 --> 00:22:03.28
The craft slowed as we scraped a submerged sandbar which kept us from a dry landing.

174
00:22:03.28 --> 00:22:08.08
Everyone wanted to get the hell off that rocking boat but the cox and that trouble dropping the steel ramp.

175
00:22:08.08 --> 00:22:13.52
When it finally slammed and splashed down, the front of the boat began to buck like a wild

176
00:22:13.52 --> 00:22:19.44
stallion, raising six or seven feet, turning slightly sideways and then slamming down again.

177
00:22:20.24 --> 00:22:26.16
The first men went to exit off about mid-Ramp. The craft surged forward and crushed the

178
00:22:26.16 --> 00:22:35.84
fort-porfellow to death. So I jumped off and moved away from the crazy erratic landing craft.

179
00:22:35.84 --> 00:22:39.36
Luckily, I didn't see anyone else get hit by the ramp.

180
00:22:40.64 --> 00:22:43.36
I was now struggling in water up to my armpits,

181
00:22:43.36 --> 00:22:47.76
luckily for me at six foot five, most of the time my head was above water.

182
00:22:48.48 --> 00:22:53.28
Later as I crossed the beach, my height would be a detriment making me a larger target.

183
00:22:54.16 --> 00:23:00.000
Meanwhile, as I tried to get to shore, shorter men grabbed my clothing to keep their heads above water.

184
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.20
Suddenly, as fear replaced seasickness, I was no longer cold.

185
00:23:06.08 --> 00:23:08.80
Most of all, I feared I would drown after being shot.

186
00:23:09.92 --> 00:23:16.000
Snipers hiding in the bluffs hit quite a few men, but most of the damage came from rapid firing

187
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:24.08
automatic weapons. In every war since gunpowder was invented, soldiers have experienced the

188
00:23:24.08 --> 00:23:28.08
dreaded feeling of being under live enemy fire for the first time.

189
00:23:28.08 --> 00:23:36.08
It was demoralizing to hear good men scream as bullets ripped into soft flesh and others scream

190
00:23:36.08 --> 00:23:39.84
as the fierce flooding tide dragged the non-swimmers under.

191
00:23:44.48 --> 00:23:50.56
I remember helping private earnest, McCandless, who was struggling to get closer in.

192
00:23:51.52 --> 00:23:55.28
He still had one of the precious boxes of 30 caliber machine gun ammo.

193
00:23:55.28 --> 00:23:59.84
I remember him shouting to me, slaughter. Are we going to get through all of this?

194
00:24:00.96 --> 00:24:05.52
I didn't know how to answer him, so I didn't say anything. To tell the truth,

195
00:24:06.96 --> 00:24:08.96
I thought we were all going to die.

196
00:24:11.68 --> 00:24:15.04
A body with its life-perferred, preserved, inflated, floated by.

197
00:24:15.60 --> 00:24:18.40
The face had turned already turned a dark purple.

198
00:24:19.36 --> 00:24:23.04
At first, I thought it was private, Richard Gomez, who had a dark complexion.

199
00:24:23.04 --> 00:24:26.16
But I later found out that Gomez had survived the day.

200
00:24:27.04 --> 00:24:29.92
The fellow I saw was just one of thousands who died.

201
00:24:31.04 --> 00:24:33.12
There is no way to be sure if I had known him.

202
00:24:34.24 --> 00:24:38.48
Many of our company were hit in the water and drowned. Good swimmers are not.

203
00:24:40.80 --> 00:24:46.56
I came ashore, surrounded by the screams of men who had been hit and were drowning under their

204
00:24:46.56 --> 00:24:53.76
ponderous loads. All around me, dead men floated in the water, along with live men who acted as if they

205
00:24:53.76 --> 00:25:00.000
were dead. The Germans couldn't tell which was which. The flooding tide washed everyone in.

206
00:25:03.84 --> 00:25:08.32
Lying at the edge of the high watermark, I watched a GI trying to cross the beach.

207
00:25:09.12 --> 00:25:12.64
He had a hard time running. I believe he was from the craft to our right.

208
00:25:12.64 --> 00:25:17.04
An enemy gunner cut him down and he staggered and fell to the sand.

209
00:25:18.24 --> 00:25:23.76
I can still hear the screaming. A well-marked medical corpsman moved quickly to help him.

210
00:25:24.56 --> 00:25:30.96
He was also shot. I'll never forget seeing that medic lying next to that dying soldier,

211
00:25:30.96 --> 00:25:39.84
both screaming for help. Within minutes, as I watched, both men fell silent and mercifully

212
00:25:39.84 --> 00:25:48.80
died. I saw men vomit at the sickening sites and others cried openly and unashamedly.

213
00:25:50.56 --> 00:25:55.28
All of us had to find it within ourselves to get across that sandy no man's land.

214
00:25:56.72 --> 00:26:01.04
This is where the army's strict discipline and rigorous training took over.

215
00:26:01.04 --> 00:26:20.32
Individual pride had a lot to do with it too. What an unbelievable first combat experience for

216
00:26:20.32 --> 00:26:28.40
these guys. I want you to think about that image of you're in a boat. You're a couple hundred

217
00:26:28.40 --> 00:26:33.36
meters off shore, maybe two or three hundred meters off shore and you're looking two hundred meters ahead of

218
00:26:33.36 --> 00:26:39.68
you and you're starting to see tracers impact on this boat that you know your next.

219
00:26:41.44 --> 00:26:46.96
You know your next. There's no turning back. There's the only thing you can do. There's nothing's

220
00:26:46.96 --> 00:26:57.84
going to stop it. Did you saw Sabie in private right? Yes. Yes. So to me, they did a good job in capturing

221
00:26:57.84 --> 00:27:02.88
that moment where everyone's like it's like real tans and you can slowly start to hear the

222
00:27:02.88 --> 00:27:08.96
boom boom and the way it kind of builds and builds and how chaotic it gets man. It's like the most

223
00:27:08.96 --> 00:27:16.72
especially at that time is one of the most real feeling movies you know and having more that.

224
00:27:16.72 --> 00:27:21.92
They did an outstanding job and they did an outstanding job in that opening stage. It's just so crazy

225
00:27:21.92 --> 00:27:28.80
like to hear the real account right and then kind of compare it and you know when you watch the

226
00:27:28.80 --> 00:27:33.20
movie you're like dang that's crazy that's because you're kind of involved in the movie but when you

227
00:27:33.20 --> 00:27:38.000
think more and you're like dang this this really happened this is what really happened. Yeah and

228
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:45.12
and also I mean obviously the actors do a good job of portraying what's going on in their minds

229
00:27:45.12 --> 00:27:53.68
but this is what was going on. Yeah this is what you was thinking. Yeah. Seeing they Steven Spielberg

230
00:27:53.68 --> 00:27:58.08
put those guys through these harsh conditions during that you know so they'd kind of

231
00:27:58.08 --> 00:28:03.12
some little Hollywood bootcare. Yeah but even while they're filming it you know to kind of help

232
00:28:03.12 --> 00:28:09.12
capture I mean obviously it's you can't compare it to the real deal. They did an outstanding job

233
00:28:09.12 --> 00:28:18.64
and the first time I saw that scene I was I was impacted. Yeah I was I was definitely impacted

234
00:28:18.64 --> 00:28:26.24
you know and I remember I wasn't with my guys in Ramadi they were honored not there were

235
00:28:26.24 --> 00:28:36.32
really hellacious situation and they were in a in a Bradley fighting vehicle and as they were

236
00:28:36.32 --> 00:28:41.04
going on to target they they were hearing rounds hit the outside of the Bradley as they were

237
00:28:41.04 --> 00:28:48.56
getting as the ramp was about to go down and actually I think I I can't remember this 100% but I'm

238
00:28:48.56 --> 00:28:53.84
pretty sure that the the young officer in that vehicle I remember him telling me I remember

239
00:28:53.84 --> 00:28:59.44
him telling me about he was like damn but he said he was screaming don't put the ramp down

240
00:29:00.08 --> 00:29:04.24
like just leave it up don't we're getting shot at and they're ready to come here so they just

241
00:29:04.24 --> 00:29:16.88
put the ramp down anyways so they didn't what he did you just go yeah yeah so back to the book

242
00:29:17.68 --> 00:29:24.56
after I fired my M1 it jammed to clean it I slipped out of my assault jacket and spread my

243
00:29:24.56 --> 00:29:32.08
raincoat only to discover bullet holes in my pack and coat suddenly overwhelmed with fear I

244
00:29:32.08 --> 00:29:40.08
became weak in the knees my hands shook as I tried to wipe sand from my weapon I had to catch my

245
00:29:40.08 --> 00:29:51.04
breath and compose myself by mid morning we had worked out worked our way to the base of the hill

246
00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:00.000
men from other units began to gather the regimental commander Colonel Charles DWCanim appeared

247
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.56
from down beach with his right arm in a sling and clutch clutching a coat 45 semi-automatic

248
00:30:06.56 --> 00:30:13.44
pistol in his bony left hand can't him didn't look like a soldier but his sir's hell was one

249
00:30:14.16 --> 00:30:20.96
he was tall and thin were wire rimmed glasses and had a pencil thin mustache he yelled for the

250
00:30:20.96 --> 00:30:28.000
officers and noncombs to help him get the men across the beach and up the hill get these men

251
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:35.76
the hell off this god damn beach and go kill some god damn crowds in a nearby pill box a

252
00:30:35.76 --> 00:30:41.60
young a lieutenant Colonel taking refuge from the enemy mortar barrage yelled out to cannon Colonel

253
00:30:41.60 --> 00:30:48.48
you better take cover you're gonna get killed Colonel canom screamed his reply get your ass out of there

254
00:30:48.48 --> 00:30:54.32
and help me get these men off this beach the officer did what cannon ordered

255
00:30:54.32 --> 00:31:10.000
so now we got somebody leading serious leader and in the book slaughter put the memorandum

256
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:19.92
from canom that canom wrote to the troops prior to D day so I'm gonna read that 29 May

257
00:31:19.92 --> 00:31:30.32
1944 memorandum two the members of CT 116 reinforced to be read by commanders to all personnel

258
00:31:30.32 --> 00:31:39.36
prior to embarkation one the long awaited day is near and prior to embarkation I want to wish

259
00:31:39.36 --> 00:31:46.24
each of you the best of luck in your forthcoming adventure there's one certain way to get the

260
00:31:46.24 --> 00:31:53.20
enemy out of action and that is to kill him war is not child's play and requires hatred for the

261
00:31:53.20 --> 00:32:01.92
enemy at this time we don't have it I hope you get it when you see your friends wounded and killed

262
00:32:04.48 --> 00:32:10.72
two learn to take care of yourself from the start remember the hunt is a crafty intelligent

263
00:32:10.72 --> 00:32:18.64
fighter and will not have mercy on you don't have it on him he will try to outwit you

264
00:32:19.52 --> 00:32:28.48
beyond the alert three fighting awards the same as any athletic event only wars for keeps

265
00:32:29.36 --> 00:32:36.88
it is you or the enemy teamwork is the essence of success we have the tools the best in the

266
00:32:36.88 --> 00:32:45.60
world and is up to you to see that they are used properly four remember when you run into the

267
00:32:45.60 --> 00:32:50.96
enemy contain him with the minimum to stop him then move around him and strike him in the flank

268
00:32:50.96 --> 00:32:59.68
or the rear in all your contacts with him be ruthless always drive hard the hunt doesn't like

269
00:32:59.68 --> 00:33:07.36
Yankee drive and guts show him that you have plenty if you close with him use your bayonet

270
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.64
show him you can take it and dish it out don't be caught napping don't let your Yankee curiosity

271
00:33:14.64 --> 00:33:22.80
get you blown up by a booby trap or a mine five take care of your arms and equipment

272
00:33:22.80 --> 00:33:31.04
conserve your ammunition make every shot count keep your weapons clean and oiled their proper

273
00:33:31.04 --> 00:33:38.000
functioning at the right time may mean your life every soldier must realize the importance of

274
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.88
supply discipline and see that he himself does his part in conserving supplies more than one battle

275
00:33:44.88 --> 00:33:52.72
has been lost because munitions and other supplies were not available six do not eat your

276
00:33:52.72 --> 00:33:59.20
K and D rations prior to D day D plus one day you won't get anymore until D plus two

277
00:34:02.56 --> 00:34:08.32
seven the Navy and air will give us plenty of support general Montgomery was very optimistic

278
00:34:08.32 --> 00:34:14.40
and is talked to the officers yesterday at this dip at this time no one knows how much resistance

279
00:34:14.40 --> 00:34:20.08
we will meet on D day we may be able to walk in without trouble we may have to fight for your life

280
00:34:20.08 --> 00:34:29.28
to meet the worst and make up your minds now that you're going forward regardless and it is a one way

281
00:34:29.28 --> 00:34:38.56
ticket we are not giving any ground at any time and we are not leaving until the job is done

282
00:34:41.36 --> 00:34:46.32
to each one of you happy landings and come off those craft fight like hell

283
00:34:46.32 --> 00:34:52.32
can't um

284
00:34:57.04 --> 00:35:03.36
lays it out definitely lays it out I think those guys

285
00:35:08.08 --> 00:35:12.24
I think those guys couldn't have heard any better information

286
00:35:12.24 --> 00:35:23.20
keep clean keep discipline be ready flank the enemy always hear that flank the enemy

287
00:35:27.20 --> 00:35:34.24
so now these guys are in kind of an in a holding position they've they've kind of secured

288
00:35:34.24 --> 00:35:39.44
some chunks of the beach and it's a little bit of the high ground and now going back to the book

289
00:35:39.44 --> 00:35:44.48
we began to think about defending against the expected counter attack that we were told would take

290
00:35:44.48 --> 00:35:50.96
place in less than 24 hours to bolster our defenses we took turns making special trips back to the

291
00:35:50.96 --> 00:35:55.76
still dangerous beach in order to find more automatic weapons ammo and supplies

292
00:35:57.04 --> 00:36:01.04
when it was my turn to go down I was horrified at what I saw

293
00:36:02.72 --> 00:36:09.12
the debris strewn beach was a disaster area the incoming flooding tide brought with it the

294
00:36:09.12 --> 00:36:15.84
bodies of hundreds of our proud regimen scores of our men with bloodstained shirts rolled in the

295
00:36:15.84 --> 00:36:24.96
serve among helmets assault jackets gas masks and M1 rifles at the edge of the water I saw

296
00:36:24.96 --> 00:36:32.40
burning landing craft that had been trying to deposit a Sherman tank down its ramp the tank was

297
00:36:32.40 --> 00:36:41.76
also burning in abandoned from our perspective the battle looked hopeless you know that's something

298
00:36:41.76 --> 00:36:48.88
that he said that a couple times he didn't think they were going to win you know despite what

299
00:36:48.88 --> 00:36:52.32
can't say they were not going to give up any ground we're guess what I don't know if we're going to

300
00:36:52.32 --> 00:37:04.16
be able to hold this ground we might all die here and yet all these men pressed on here's a little

301
00:37:04.16 --> 00:37:11.44
here's a little look at the German attitude right here I saw regimental intelligence officer

302
00:37:11.44 --> 00:37:17.04
armed with a carbine interrogating a German prisoner the prisoner was on his knees with his hands

303
00:37:17.04 --> 00:37:23.68
behind his head he was rather small and frail looking I was surprised to see he was not wearing the

304
00:37:23.68 --> 00:37:31.60
usual square shaped battle helmet instead he wore a gray build cap the lieutenant asked the prisoner

305
00:37:31.60 --> 00:37:38.08
among other things where the mine fields were the soldier answered only with the accepted Geneva

306
00:37:38.08 --> 00:37:44.88
convention requirement of name rank and serial number we had been instructed not to take prisoners

307
00:37:44.88 --> 00:37:51.84
for the first two or three days so I expected the officer to eventually shoot the prisoner again the

308
00:37:51.84 --> 00:38:00.48
interrogator screamed where are the damn mine fields again he received the same reply name rank

309
00:38:00.48 --> 00:38:07.36
and serial number the lieutenant's carbine barked but the bullet was aimed at the ground between the

310
00:38:07.36 --> 00:38:14.96
prisoners knees the arrogant German looks straight at the officer and said with a smirk nicked here

311
00:38:16.80 --> 00:38:26.08
not here he pointed between his knees here he pointed to his head this told me something about our

312
00:38:26.08 --> 00:38:40.24
adversary so you had I mean you we we we we know that people will fight to the death we know that

313
00:38:40.24 --> 00:38:46.08
they get brainwashed him when you look at any history this this sounds like a young kid probably

314
00:38:46.08 --> 00:38:54.08
raised from the young very young age as a Nazi as a loyal Nazi just like the Japanese that fall to

315
00:38:54.08 --> 00:39:05.36
the death that's what we have here in many cases back to the book combat deaths are ugly and

316
00:39:05.36 --> 00:39:15.28
sickening a bullet or piece of red hot shrapnel tears flesh gristle and bone into gruesome wounds

317
00:39:16.48 --> 00:39:21.28
a few hours in the sun causes a body to swell grotesquely and turn dark purple

318
00:39:21.28 --> 00:39:30.08
the stench is unbearable such deaths were tragic insults to all those handsome young geys just

319
00:39:30.08 --> 00:39:38.08
beginning their lives who would not fulfill their dreams many of those killed were like me

320
00:39:38.08 --> 00:39:43.52
barely teenagers when they enlisted just starting to grow to maturity in the army

321
00:39:43.52 --> 00:39:51.84
those comrades and I spent many happy weekends and furloughs together soaking up culture and drinking

322
00:39:51.84 --> 00:39:57.68
bidders shared living quarters ready each other's mail and more significantly

323
00:39:58.32 --> 00:40:01.28
shared the misery of training in the most extreme developments

324
00:40:04.64 --> 00:40:12.08
the hundred and sixteenth infantry lost from 800 to 1000 men on D. Day and D. Company lost at least

325
00:40:12.08 --> 00:40:23.68
72 of the dead 20 of them were from my hometown of Roanoke five of nine of our officers were killed

326
00:40:24.72 --> 00:40:31.60
including capital wall curshilling lieutenant William Gardner lieutenant Merrill Cummings

327
00:40:31.60 --> 00:40:39.44
lieutenant Vincent Lobowitz and lieutenant Alton Ashley there were 12 noncombs killed

328
00:40:39.44 --> 00:40:50.16
including these rowanokers sergeant James Obenchane staff sergeant James L. Wright sergeant

329
00:40:50.16 --> 00:40:56.96
Russell Jack Ingram and sergeant George D. Johnson Corporal Jack Sims

330
00:40:56.96 --> 00:41:10.16
add to the list of the dead 23 privates and another 32 wounded many of them severely

331
00:41:13.04 --> 00:41:19.92
and yet our nightmare had just begun brutal

332
00:41:19.92 --> 00:41:29.28
absolutely brutal and I wanted to rattle off those names of all those people from the hometown

333
00:41:31.92 --> 00:41:40.08
when we see a soldier or a marine or a sailor get killed now you see what it does to a town

334
00:41:40.08 --> 00:41:50.08
you see out of impacts a town imagine 20 from one little home town

335
00:41:53.92 --> 00:42:02.08
they moved past the initial D. Day and now they start to head to St. Low and this is where you

336
00:42:02.08 --> 00:42:06.000
've heard about before if you know anything about history you know anything about this part of the

337
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.52
war this is when they get into head drill country and they're fighting from head drill to

338
00:42:11.52 --> 00:42:17.04
head drill these head drills are you know these ancient I guess they're not structures

339
00:42:17.04 --> 00:42:22.48
their hedges but they're completely difficult to get through you have to cut through them

340
00:42:22.48 --> 00:42:26.16
a drive-thru and what tanks or whatever and they hold up and every one of these head drills

341
00:42:26.16 --> 00:42:34.56
becomes like a mini battle and their brutal battles back to the book the site of another

342
00:42:34.56 --> 00:42:40.40
terrible death that occurred at this time haunts my dreams to this day my squadron I

343
00:42:40.40 --> 00:42:45.36
were digging a machine gun in place may be behind a scrubby head drill we had just finished fixing

344
00:42:45.36 --> 00:42:49.52
the camouflage when it happens to you junior officer with field glasses scanning the front

345
00:42:50.64 --> 00:42:56.80
I could tell he was a newly arrived replacement his uniform and equipment were relatively new

346
00:42:56.80 --> 00:43:04.48
and unworn the sharp report of an 88 millimeter fired from some somewhere nearby

347
00:43:04.48 --> 00:43:11.04
and sent me diving at the same time the high explosive missile hit the lieutenant's upper torso

348
00:43:12.48 --> 00:43:18.48
the second squadron I were splattered with gore as the spotter was blown backward minus his head

349
00:43:20.72 --> 00:43:27.76
number two gunner private first class sal artery vomited and I nearly did too

350
00:43:27.76 --> 00:43:37.68
the dreaded German sniper was almost as highly respected as the 88 sharpers shooters gave no warning

351
00:43:37.68 --> 00:43:44.88
taking careful aim with sniper scoped mousers the receiving end would hear the sharp crack

352
00:43:44.88 --> 00:43:50.64
and instantaneous wind of the bullet if you heard the report of the bullet leaving the muzzle it

353
00:43:50.64 --> 00:43:57.52
wasn't for you German snipers nearly always aimed for the head if it was visible and in

354
00:43:57.52 --> 00:44:04.48
range most infantry men never removed their helmets except when they shaved and I confess that I

355
00:44:04.48 --> 00:44:10.72
slept in mind the 8 millimeter bullet could easily pass through the helmet through the head

356
00:44:10.72 --> 00:44:17.36
and out the other side with enough energy left to do more damage I saw men get hit between the eyes

357
00:44:17.36 --> 00:44:23.44
or just above the years which killed them instantly if the bullet missed the helmet the entry

358
00:44:23.44 --> 00:44:30.96
hole was usually neat and showed only a small trickle of blood but after the steel jacket bullet

359
00:44:30.96 --> 00:44:37.28
hit the helmet or the skull the bullet flattened causing the wound to shatter the other side of the

360
00:44:37.28 --> 00:44:39.28
head away

361
00:44:39.28 --> 00:44:57.28
this start receiving more fire he jumps for cover and then back to the book I climbed back

362
00:44:57.28 --> 00:45:03.20
on the path shaking but unscathed within minutes I had another surprise as I approached

363
00:45:03.20 --> 00:45:07.76
an opening on the right side of the head draw I heard someone moaning crawling carefully

364
00:45:07.76 --> 00:45:12.64
through the opening I came face to face with a young German paratrooper who had been hit by a large

365
00:45:12.64 --> 00:45:20.000
chunk of shrapnel he had a very serious upper thigh wound and his left trouser leg was bloody and torn

366
00:45:21.84 --> 00:45:27.44
this was my first encounter with the enemy up close the German paratrooper is a fierce and

367
00:45:27.44 --> 00:45:34.64
fanatical warrior easily distinguishable by his round helmet and baggy smock my first reaction was to

368
00:45:34.64 --> 00:45:42.08
put him out of his misery and keep going I believe he knew what I was thinking he begged

369
00:45:42.08 --> 00:45:49.84
dearfully comrade bitta to means friend please he was an impressive looking young soldier about

370
00:45:49.84 --> 00:46:00.56
19 years old my age he was as filthy as I was with long brown stringy hair I'd always thought

371
00:46:00.56 --> 00:46:08.000
most German soldiers had short blonde hair he had an athletic build about five feet 10 inches tall

372
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:15.76
about 180 pounds and a handsome face I suspended the promise I had made at the beach about not

373
00:46:15.76 --> 00:46:25.12
taking any prisoners I thought this that was then and this is now I just couldn't shoot a wounded

374
00:46:25.12 --> 00:46:31.92
human being at point blank range I made sure he didn't have a weapon hidden on him then I tied his

375
00:46:31.92 --> 00:46:37.28
belt around his upper thigh which stopped the blood from gushing I gently swabbed the dirt from

376
00:46:37.28 --> 00:46:46.80
his wound and applied sulfur powder his winds turned to a forest grin he was in pain so I gave

377
00:46:46.80 --> 00:46:53.12
machata morphine and a drink of water from my canteen then I let him have one of my lucky strikes

378
00:46:53.12 --> 00:47:00.000
cigarettes and lit it for him as I left he smiled weekly and said in gutterl broken English

379
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:08.64
donka god bless good luck that changed my thinking about taking prisoners I still hated the

380
00:47:08.64 --> 00:47:16.56
enemy but I couldn't kill one at close at range especially if his hands were up I sent one of

381
00:47:16.56 --> 00:47:23.28
our medics to finish what I had started I hope the German would recover and that is war was over

382
00:47:29.92 --> 00:47:36.80
that's compassionate human being right there yeah does it kind of in a way put into perspective

383
00:47:36.80 --> 00:47:45.36
but more shed the light shed light on potentially the overall attitude where you're fighting a

384
00:47:45.36 --> 00:47:52.08
war and the enemy is more this entity of an enemy you know it's not like how many kicked this

385
00:47:52.08 --> 00:47:58.000
guy's I'm sure it's like it's not personal yeah yes and the US and the military we still do this

386
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:04.16
they're gonna dehumanize the enemy as much as they can to make it easier for you to kill them yes

387
00:48:04.16 --> 00:48:09.76
that's why you call them crowds that's why you call them dinks that's why you call whatever the

388
00:48:09.76 --> 00:48:16.08
slang you know what would now be all be considered racial terms or politically incorrect terms

389
00:48:16.08 --> 00:48:22.88
there's a reason they're trying to dehumanize these other people they're trying to dehumanize

390
00:48:22.88 --> 00:48:28.48
the enemy so that you can more easily kill them and when you come face to face with them all

391
00:48:28.48 --> 00:48:34.40
the sudden they become human yeah isn't that crazy though like this whole crazy thing hold this

392
00:48:34.40 --> 00:48:41.12
probably the crazy thing imaginable for this guy he comes face to face with a guy that that

393
00:48:42.32 --> 00:48:47.52
you know kind of in between the bullets so to speak and he's face to face with this person and

394
00:48:47.52 --> 00:48:53.12
then really what the whole experience was reduced to in that moment is this one person helping

395
00:48:53.12 --> 00:48:59.12
another person you know and then even and it impacted both of them obviously you know where the

396
00:48:59.12 --> 00:49:03.76
guy was like hey god bless almost like came in we're in this war I dig it almost like a football

397
00:49:03.76 --> 00:49:08.32
gamer something like amen I dig it you know we're on this back different teams a good luck he told

398
00:49:08.32 --> 00:49:16.72
him good luck in a war man it's a man that that whole human factor when when you're exposed to it

399
00:49:16.72 --> 00:49:23.36
even with the enemy tank like that's gotta be strong huh yeah definitely definitely can be

400
00:49:23.36 --> 00:49:27.84
I mean in in World War one I mean there was times where then this is really famous there was

401
00:49:27.84 --> 00:49:31.84
times where they got out of the trenches and played soccer on Christmas day against each other

402
00:49:31.84 --> 00:49:38.72
and then the next day go back to slaughter each other crazy that must feel in in this weird way that

403
00:49:38.72 --> 00:49:45.20
must feel so good you know to be like like you know like you ever gotten like when you're a kid

404
00:49:45.20 --> 00:49:50.32
or even as an adult when you get you know like a argument with someone real bad maybe your friend

405
00:49:50.32 --> 00:49:55.28
or or not whatever you get a real bad argument with them and I don't know it lasted there too

406
00:49:55.28 --> 00:50:01.04
or we got to know whatever it's real bad and at the end you guys make up and you guys are like

407
00:50:01.04 --> 00:50:06.80
back friends again it's almost like it's such a good feeling maybe because of the contrast or

408
00:50:06.80 --> 00:50:11.92
I don't know maybe because I don't know but it's like it has to have like that kind of feeling

409
00:50:11.92 --> 00:50:17.12
when you're in this crazy war you're like I hate this so much hatred and just aggression and

410
00:50:17.12 --> 00:50:21.28
opposite you gotta remember this is there's plenty of guys and there's plenty of Germans I got

411
00:50:21.28 --> 00:50:27.12
smoked right there without a second yeah yeah and he just had that moment and maybe if that guy

412
00:50:27.12 --> 00:50:30.96
would have looked a little bit different or acted a little bit different or something happened more

413
00:50:30.96 --> 00:50:36.32
quicker like faster or something you know it just slowed down just for that second and and

414
00:50:36.32 --> 00:50:40.96
sucked them right there and it's like a both right hand what happened later the next people that

415
00:50:40.96 --> 00:50:44.80
came out the medic might have gone over and said wait you sent me over here to work on a German

416
00:50:45.36 --> 00:50:48.48
yeah that could have happened to you just never know

417
00:50:48.48 --> 00:50:58.56
thank now we're gonna start getting crushed with some artillery

418
00:51:00.48 --> 00:51:08.40
back to the book Jerry pounded the 116th all day and two nights with blockbuster 155

419
00:51:08.40 --> 00:51:15.60
millimeter and 105 millimeter artillery near misses caused enough concussion to make our ears ring

420
00:51:15.60 --> 00:51:22.16
and our heads ache the pounding rounds of salvo after salvo of earthshaking artillery

421
00:51:22.16 --> 00:51:28.000
will relentless and frightening during the bombardment I shared a long shallow slit

422
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:35.20
trance with one of my first decompany replacements private Lewis Cass from Chevy Chase Maryland

423
00:51:35.20 --> 00:51:40.80
we nicknamed him junior early on because of his boyish looks and demeanor junior was from an

424
00:51:40.80 --> 00:51:46.96
affluent family and had volunteered into the army upon graduation from high school he didn't

425
00:51:46.96 --> 00:51:54.56
look like the type that could last very long in brutal combat our slit trunch was covered with wooden

426
00:51:54.56 --> 00:52:00.40
sheathing atop through the roof of piled dirt like thousands of other infantry soldiers

427
00:52:00.40 --> 00:52:07.68
subjected to such heavy bombardment junior and I wore a pitiful sight find yellow dust sifted

428
00:52:07.68 --> 00:52:14.96
through the cracks and the roof and stuck to our sweaty skin and eyes if the dust it had been

429
00:52:14.96 --> 00:52:21.12
black we would have looked like very tired coal miners the yellow dust turned a mud around our

430
00:52:21.12 --> 00:52:27.60
swollen bloodshot eyes when nature called we had to answer in the safety of our slit trunch lying down

431
00:52:29.60 --> 00:52:35.28
all the training and experience in the world could not have prepared us for this kind of harassment

432
00:52:35.28 --> 00:52:42.32
those box our boxed car side shells sounded like they were flip flopping and over and

433
00:52:42.32 --> 00:52:49.12
and screeching straight for our whole this went on hour after hour all day and through the night

434
00:52:51.04 --> 00:52:55.28
many good soldiers cracked and who could blame them

435
00:52:58.72 --> 00:53:04.88
the long bouts of duty had been taking their toll it was extremely rare for an infantry

436
00:53:04.88 --> 00:53:13.12
men to go unscathed for very long many twenty-niners were wounded two three or four times fighting

437
00:53:13.12 --> 00:53:19.28
through the hedgeros of Normandy all of us were praying for the million dollar wound

438
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:26.16
which missed vital organs bone and nerves but would give us a long stay in an English hospital

439
00:53:26.16 --> 00:53:32.000
sleeping under clean white sheets and at least in fantasy in the care of a beautiful nurse

440
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:42.24
meanwhile battle fatigue and self-inflicted wounds had become serious problems at least once nearly

441
00:53:42.24 --> 00:53:47.60
all combat soldiers if they are honest consider shooting themselves in order to get out of the

442
00:53:47.60 --> 00:53:55.28
hell of battle self-inflicted wounds however are considered disgraceful and if proven in

443
00:53:55.28 --> 00:54:04.40
a court martial offense nevertheless many respectable kia and wounded in action were in reality

444
00:54:04.40 --> 00:54:15.36
self-inflicted or friendly fire accidents so we have some massive stress

445
00:54:16.80 --> 00:54:23.52
stress that's driving men to shoot themselves yeah another mention of the million dollar wound yes

446
00:54:23.52 --> 00:54:30.48
you know like the ticket out you know and he's saying at least once nearly all combat soldiers

447
00:54:30.48 --> 00:54:35.36
if they are honest consider shooting themselves in order to get out of the hell of battle

448
00:54:39.44 --> 00:54:44.96
back to the book land mines and booby traps were also common ways to be wounded or killed

449
00:54:46.24 --> 00:54:50.72
hearing the news of who had gotten hit was always hard and every day new faces replaced

450
00:54:50.72 --> 00:54:58.16
seasoned infantry men it was easy to distinguish a new arrival from a veteran the old

451
00:54:58.16 --> 00:55:05.12
timer could be 18 or 19 years old but if he had survived a week on the front he was considered old

452
00:55:06.88 --> 00:55:15.92
and we all looked it on a diet of k-rashions we all lost weight our ribs shoulder blades

453
00:55:15.92 --> 00:55:22.000
and atoms apples stuck out and our filthy ragged uniforms hung like worn out drapes

454
00:55:23.12 --> 00:55:28.000
our eyes were blood red and sunken and we had bleeding swords on our exposed skin

455
00:55:29.28 --> 00:55:35.12
ordinarily ordinarily these would be telltale signs that a man needs a month's rest

456
00:55:36.08 --> 00:55:40.000
but we all knew there would be no rest until Saint low was taken

457
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:48.96
knowing that there was no immediate end in sight drove some fellas over the edge

458
00:55:50.32 --> 00:55:53.84
a few good soldiers who couldn't take the pounding day after day

459
00:55:55.36 --> 00:55:56.32
committed suicide

460
00:55:59.44 --> 00:56:06.48
this was the case of Stanley Corsiac a 19-year-old private born and raised in Chicago

461
00:56:06.48 --> 00:56:12.56
he was a tough athletic little soldier he made the day landings and had fought well through the

462
00:56:12.56 --> 00:56:21.52
hedgeros but everyone has a breaking point his squad reported that Stan who had seen many of his

463
00:56:21.52 --> 00:56:28.64
close friends killed or severely wounded had begun to act strangely strangely he cried often

464
00:56:28.64 --> 00:56:34.64
especially during incoming artillery barrages and sometimes his crying reached the point of his

465
00:56:34.64 --> 00:56:42.96
stereo instead of the usual disciplinary action for similar behavior he was sent back to the kitchen

466
00:56:42.96 --> 00:56:49.52
area for a break from the action many of us thought that a few days rest a couple of hot meals

467
00:56:49.52 --> 00:56:57.20
and a warm bath might rehabilitate him but he was in more pain than any of us had realized

468
00:56:57.20 --> 00:57:07.92
why couldn't we see that he had reached his limit? Private Corsiac found a cooks springfield

469
00:57:07.92 --> 00:57:15.52
O3 rifle removed his shoe so he could pull the trigger and blew the top of his head off

470
00:57:17.52 --> 00:57:20.000
one of the cooks heard the shot and ran to his tent

471
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:27.28
Stanley Corsiac had had enough of the constant fear the filthy grime the ears chattering

472
00:57:27.28 --> 00:57:33.36
explosions the putrid smells the extrusion pain and the maiming and deaths of his close friends

473
00:57:36.72 --> 00:57:39.52
Stan Corsiac died on July 2nd

474
00:57:39.52 --> 00:57:51.68
the record book shows he was killed a non-battle casualty in my book Private Corsiac died

475
00:57:53.68 --> 00:58:02.40
and American hero so we got to know that this demon that we're dealing with now

476
00:58:02.40 --> 00:58:15.52
has been around for a long time and you know that's a classic situation where his death

477
00:58:15.52 --> 00:58:22.80
Stan Corsiac's death is reported as a non-battle casualty which means no one labeled him a

478
00:58:22.80 --> 00:58:32.24
suicide which means how many people did that happen to and it was never captured they

479
00:58:32.24 --> 00:58:37.68
wasn't reported and so now we never dealt with it

480
00:58:40.32 --> 00:58:44.16
that if you don't deal with things you don't capture the lessons learned if you don't recognize

481
00:58:44.16 --> 00:58:53.44
these things how you get a fixum as Bob Slotter pointed out it was almost impossible for one of these

482
00:58:53.44 --> 00:58:59.68
guys to go day after day after day and not get wounded and he ended up getting wounded

483
00:58:59.68 --> 00:59:09.60
got trapped in a fragment of the bag gets pulled off the battlefield luckily

484
00:59:10.56 --> 00:59:21.76
and sent to an English hospital and here's what he says about that it is one thing to visit

485
00:59:21.76 --> 00:59:31.28
a wartime army hospital but something quite different and much worse to be a patient in one.

486
00:59:31.28 --> 00:59:36.24
Lawmakers will consider armed conflicts more carefully before rattling the proverbial savor if they

487
00:59:36.24 --> 00:59:42.32
were forced to visit an amputee abdominal burn or plastic surgery ward.

488
00:59:42.32 --> 00:59:54.80
Here that lawmakers before you send the boys off to war you need to go and spend some time in a

489
00:59:54.80 --> 01:00:02.08
hospital with wounded vets and make damn sure your decision that you're making.

490
01:00:02.08 --> 01:00:12.96
Back to the book I recovered in a ward dedicated to abdominal wound abdominal wound patients

491
01:00:14.40 --> 01:00:19.84
a bullet or a piece of metal shrapnel puncturing the stomach can cause a lifetime of embarrassment

492
01:00:19.84 --> 01:00:27.04
and misery. The aftermath of a gut wound is either death or eternal marriage to a

493
01:00:27.04 --> 01:00:35.04
colostomy sack the stench in that ward was predictable it was tough to share quarters with

494
01:00:35.04 --> 01:00:43.28
seriously wounded patients at night the morning and groaning and sometimes screaming made it hard to

495
01:00:43.28 --> 01:00:55.36
sleep many of the men there died. I remember one particularly sad boss swar the tony from Brooklyn

496
01:00:55.36 --> 01:01:01.04
was the third floor clown the shift nurse is fell in love with him because he kept the

497
01:01:01.04 --> 01:01:07.44
ward laughing with his teasing and practical jokes but one night his cherished laughter came to an

498
01:01:07.44 --> 01:01:14.56
awful end on a Saturday night with a skeleton crew on duty to only begin to be complained of a

499
01:01:14.56 --> 01:01:21.60
sharp pain to the gut. The floor nurse was paged and after several tries she arrived

500
01:01:21.60 --> 01:01:27.12
by that time tony was screaming as two orderlies quickly wheeled them into the emergency room.

501
01:01:29.04 --> 01:01:40.80
Two hours later tony was dead of gang green poisoning. Facial district facial disfigurement

502
01:01:40.80 --> 01:01:47.36
was terrible and more devastating to the patient than any other kind of wound. A few men had lost

503
01:01:47.36 --> 01:01:54.56
arms or legs either partly or completely and as a result some of them became so called basket

504
01:01:54.56 --> 01:02:03.92
cases even so and it sad to say some severely maimed men were actually happy about their condition

505
01:02:03.92 --> 01:02:16.000
because they were going home their combat days were over. So the war ends and actually Bob

506
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.04
slaughtered does go back he recovers from his wounds he goes back he's there for the

507
01:02:22.16 --> 01:02:28.56
allied victory and that's another just fantastic story of how that all happens.

508
01:02:33.68 --> 01:02:37.92
And then he was out of the out of the army

509
01:02:37.92 --> 01:02:48.000
and this is what that feels like back to the book. On July 13th 1945 I was suddenly separated

510
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.20
from the service discharged at Fort Mead Maryland with a few dollars in my pocket and the

511
01:02:53.20 --> 01:03:00.96
Kackie uniform on my back. I was suffering mental as well as physical wounds but there was no

512
01:03:00.96 --> 01:03:07.92
one to counsel me. I was a civilian again but I was not comfortable socializing with other

513
01:03:07.92 --> 01:03:15.44
civilians. I was 20 years old with an 11th grade education and no skills other than soldering.

514
01:03:17.52 --> 01:03:26.32
I was left alone to find my way home to Rono, Virginia. There was no treatment for post-traumatic

515
01:03:26.32 --> 01:03:33.60
stress syndrome. It was simply called battle fatigue. Those of us who had returned from the war

516
01:03:33.60 --> 01:03:43.28
were left to tough it out. The years rolled by our hair grade and thinned,

517
01:03:43.28 --> 01:03:50.32
waistlines grew and many of our company associates developed health problems. Our generation

518
01:03:50.32 --> 01:03:56.64
smoked cigarettes and drank hard liquor. Many of our men who had high halfway around the world

519
01:03:56.64 --> 01:04:02.72
became sedentary. We didn't like to exercise. We traveled to the beach and went to swimming pools

520
01:04:02.72 --> 01:04:09.76
thinking that sunshine was good for the skin. Many were disabled by wounds. Drank and smoke too

521
01:04:09.76 --> 01:04:16.24
much and died prematurely. The war still took its toll long after it was over.

522
01:04:16.24 --> 01:04:27.12
Rarely did anyone talk about the war. The media or silent are children uninterested

523
01:04:28.40 --> 01:04:31.20
and we ourselves sought to forget.

524
01:04:31.20 --> 01:04:49.36
I got married, raised two sons and went to work for a mid-sized newspaper in a mid-sized community.

525
01:04:51.20 --> 01:04:56.24
I found time to acquire a modicum of education, coach little league baseball,

526
01:04:56.24 --> 01:05:06.000
and was grateful to live a normal American life. Two many of my army buddies failed to reach

527
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:15.76
their 25th birthday and many of those who did were never the same. After what they'd been through,

528
01:05:15.76 --> 01:05:21.84
they just couldn't adjust to the real world. Many of them fell prey to alcohol,

529
01:05:21.84 --> 01:05:27.84
loose women, radical religion, or isolation. Anything to help them get through each day,

530
01:05:27.84 --> 01:05:35.20
month and year. Seven of our D company men committed suicide.

531
01:05:37.28 --> 01:05:40.72
Compared to those and thousands more, I have been blessed.

532
01:05:42.80 --> 01:05:49.76
In some ways, writing this book, a process that has taken me almost 15 years has been the last

533
01:05:49.76 --> 01:05:58.24
leg of the journey. I realize that I speak for many who never had the chance to speak for themselves

534
01:05:58.24 --> 01:06:05.68
and I've done my best to pay them tribute. My hope is that this memoir,

535
01:06:06.48 --> 01:06:12.96
and however small a way will perpetuate their memory and stand as a witness to their sacrifices.

536
01:06:12.96 --> 01:06:22.08
It's saddens and worries me that so much of the world, including America itself, refuses to

537
01:06:22.08 --> 01:06:30.48
learn the hard lessons of the past. Now that I'm in my 80s, I am well aware that the long

538
01:06:30.48 --> 01:06:39.20
march that begins so many years ago is about to come to a halt. I am proud to say that my

539
01:06:39.20 --> 01:06:45.36
generation helped save the world from tyranny, prevent the extinction of an entire group of people

540
01:06:45.36 --> 01:06:49.52
and preserve the democratic freedoms of our wonderful American way of life.

541
01:06:49.52 --> 01:07:04.24
I wouldn't change a thing except to wish that my dear army buddies could be here too.

542
01:07:04.24 --> 01:07:28.48
And John Robert Bob Slotter died on May 29, 2012, and William Blake, the poet,

543
01:07:28.48 --> 01:07:40.24
you asked who can stand and I will tell you it is men like Bob Slotter that stand.

544
01:07:43.76 --> 01:07:53.60
And it's men like him that encourage me, and tell me in no uncertain terms that we are

545
01:07:53.60 --> 01:08:05.68
capable of more. We can do more, we can be more. We can stand.

546
01:08:15.04 --> 01:08:20.08
Not much to say after that one echo. No sir. Not much to say.

547
01:08:20.08 --> 01:08:31.28
Yeah, obviously I can't help but agree fully. A lot of these, we go through these books.

548
01:08:31.28 --> 01:08:38.72
It's crazy how much it puts into perspective. Everyone knows about World War II.

549
01:08:38.72 --> 01:08:42.88
Everyone knows, most people we know about World War II. We know about the wars, but that's

550
01:08:44.24 --> 01:08:49.04
we don't really know about the wars. We don't know about the details that we don't know about

551
01:08:49.04 --> 01:08:57.12
individual experiences, which really is that's what makes the wars. Yes. And we don't know anything about that.

552
01:08:57.76 --> 01:09:03.36
And what's interesting, this book was recommended to me from Twitter, from one of the troopers out there.

553
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.80
And so we have the band of brothers, right? And everybody knows band of brothers, I'm not everybody,

554
01:09:08.80 --> 01:09:14.48
but most people, more people know band of brothers. Because it was a book and then it was a big

555
01:09:14.48 --> 01:09:26.88
HBO movie and it was awesome. This book is less well known. But what you have to know is that there's

556
01:09:26.88 --> 01:09:33.44
thousands and thousands of stories that we don't know and we will never know. I mean, some of

557
01:09:33.44 --> 01:09:40.16
we will try to know, but there's so many stories that we will never know. That moment in combat,

558
01:09:40.16 --> 01:09:46.000
when this guy tried to save that guy and they both did something completely heroic and they both

559
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:54.000
died and we never will know. So we have to cherish what we can find out, what we can learn.

560
01:09:57.76 --> 01:10:06.96
But there's just so much there and so much sacrifice that was made. And as I always say,

561
01:10:06.96 --> 01:10:20.80
what are we doing right now to honor that sacrifice? More, that's what we need to do, more.

562
01:10:27.68 --> 01:10:35.44
And with that, let's make a, let's make the hard transition once again to the,

563
01:10:35.44 --> 01:10:40.16
the rough transition to the interweb for some questions.

564
01:10:41.92 --> 01:10:51.68
Speaking of interwebs on it.com slash jockel is where you can get 10% off of the spectacular supplements.

565
01:10:52.88 --> 01:11:02.88
Namely, real oil and shrimp tech. What about alpha briny? That's good that you remember that you

566
01:11:02.88 --> 01:11:08.88
must have been on alpha briny. And also you might want to just do yourself that favor and get some of

567
01:11:08.88 --> 01:11:17.92
those words. What else? What else? If you're in the mood to support this podcast before you shop

575
01:12:09.92 --> 01:12:18.000
Oh, we do. Know the darkness. To appreciate. You know the saying, well, I know that this podcast can

576
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.12
get a little bit dark from time to time. Yeah, because you know how like you're a regional, um,

577
01:12:23.12 --> 01:12:27.92
one of your regional things was, you know, you go through life and certain people all they see is

578
01:12:27.92 --> 01:12:35.52
is the good thing so they get kind of desensitized to like the just small little good things in life.

579
01:12:35.52 --> 01:12:39.68
You know, someone you when you and that's really everything anyway where, you know, when you

580
01:12:39.68 --> 01:12:45.60
there's no tall people if everyone's the same size. So you kind of got to know both, you know,

581
01:12:45.60 --> 01:12:52.56
the both short and tall. No, I've said it many times and I think there originally, I think I originally

582
01:12:52.56 --> 01:12:57.20
said it on the Tim Ferrissio. He said he said something along lines of like, hey,

583
01:12:58.56 --> 01:13:04.80
jockel, I've struggled with depression. How close should you get to the darkness? Right, right.

584
01:13:05.20 --> 01:13:08.40
Because I was talking about some dark things and I said well, Tim,

585
01:13:08.40 --> 01:13:16.24
um, if you really want to know the light, then you got to know the darkness. Right. So echo made a

586
01:13:16.24 --> 01:13:20.88
t-shirt about the darkness. Yeah, just as know that. And here's the thing, I kind of added another

587
01:13:20.88 --> 01:13:26.48
dimension to it. It's it's all black. It's black on black. So you see, you can't, you know, it's all dark.

588
01:13:27.12 --> 01:13:33.36
You can kind of see it. Anyway, it's cool. New shirt. New shirt up. If you want that one.

589
01:13:33.36 --> 01:13:40.40
Um, yep. There it is. Let's get to some questions from the interwebs. First question.

590
01:13:42.64 --> 01:13:50.88
Jockel, what is your relationship to surfing? Could you surf on active duty and what is surfing

591
01:13:50.88 --> 01:14:00.40
do for you? Okay, so my relationship with surfing. Number one, I was lucky to have a guy that

592
01:14:00.40 --> 01:14:06.08
when I was a kid up in Maine. That said, hey, I'm going to teach you how to surf. This guy was a

593
01:14:06.08 --> 01:14:10.96
lifeguard. He was an outstanding surfer. And he said, I'm going to teach you how to surf. And I was

594
01:14:10.96 --> 01:14:17.20
a 10 year old kid. Nice. What? In the freezing cold water. And I said, yeah, awesome. Then so he gave

595
01:14:17.20 --> 01:14:21.60
me an old surf board and put me out there and taught me how to surf when I was 10 years old. And it

596
01:14:21.60 --> 01:14:27.20
definitely, you know, surfing up in Maine is a little bit different because it's dark and it's cold.

597
01:14:27.20 --> 01:14:33.12
And you got to do a little bit of suffering if you want to enjoy the benefits of it. You got to know

598
01:14:33.12 --> 01:14:38.16
the darkness. I don't know. I said anything about the darkness. So surfing. Yeah, quite. Yeah,

599
01:14:38.16 --> 01:14:43.28
coi, you didn't have to deal with that. So that's how I got it surfing and surfing a lot of people

600
01:14:43.28 --> 01:14:51.92
will tell you when you do it. It's it's somewhat addictive because it's a very, a very, you know,

601
01:14:51.92 --> 01:14:56.64
kind of paradoxical thing because it's very relaxing at the same time. It's very kind of exciting.

602
01:14:56.64 --> 01:15:00.40
I guess is the word you get a little adrenaline, but you get a little melodout to. So it's a very

603
01:15:00.40 --> 01:15:08.64
fun thing to do. Good for you. It's good for your brain. It's good for the soul. And when I was on

604
01:15:08.64 --> 01:15:14.48
activity, if you're on active duty in the sales teams, yeah, you can surf. And I definitely surf.

605
01:15:14.48 --> 01:15:23.04
Sometimes more, more, I was more focused on surfing than others. When I really went B. J. J. Crazy,

606
01:15:23.04 --> 01:15:30.72
I wasn't doing anything else with any free time other than J. J. So that's, but yeah,

607
01:15:30.72 --> 01:15:35.44
there's guys. There's guys in the sealed teams that that actually manipulate their career

608
01:15:35.44 --> 01:15:39.28
around surfing because you can get station and you can go on trips to great surf spots.

609
01:15:39.92 --> 01:15:44.32
And all that and there's some, there's some pretty amazing surfers in the sealed

610
01:15:44.32 --> 01:15:47.36
teams in the military as well. But I mean, I only know about guys in sealed them. There's a

611
01:15:47.36 --> 01:15:54.000
good guy named Ivan Trent, whose dad was Busy trying to fame this old pioneer surfer in Hawaii.

612
01:15:55.20 --> 01:15:59.44
And Ivan Trent, what I was a picture when I first got in the sealed teams, there was a picture of

613
01:15:59.44 --> 01:16:05.04
Ivan Trent dropping in on a giant wave that would me obey the famous one via Bay. So there's some great

614
01:16:05.04 --> 01:16:10.08
surfers. It's definitely a little subculture inside the teams and you could definitely,

615
01:16:10.96 --> 01:16:15.20
you can definitely surf a lot. I mean, you're living in San Diego or Virginia Beach. I mean,

616
01:16:15.20 --> 01:16:20.000
Virginia Beach has waves sometimes. San Diego has waves a lot of the times.

617
01:16:21.60 --> 01:16:28.40
And what does it do for me? Well, one thing is it gets to get you outside. It gets me outside

618
01:16:28.96 --> 01:16:32.72
and gets you out into nature. And what I like about nature,

619
01:16:34.16 --> 01:16:40.48
nature, what I like about nature is nature makes you feel small. That's what nature, to me,

620
01:16:40.48 --> 01:16:44.72
that's what's good about nature. That's what, that's why nature puts things in perspective

621
01:16:44.72 --> 01:16:50.16
because nature makes you feel small. Make you realize, you know what, look at the ocean. I'm nothing.

622
01:16:50.80 --> 01:16:55.60
Look at the giant wilderness, I'm in, I'm nothing. So it just keeps you in check and keeps you

623
01:16:55.60 --> 01:16:59.92
in perspective. That's one of the, that's actually one of the things that the, probably the only

624
01:16:59.92 --> 01:17:06.64
thing I don't like about your jet to is pretty much the most part. It's inside. It's inside the gym on the

625
01:17:06.64 --> 01:17:13.44
mat. And so, you know, you can do it outside, but it's hard to do outside. This is the Matt's

626
01:17:13.44 --> 01:17:20.40
get super hot. It's just not, it's just a thousand times more efficient and convenient to do

627
01:17:20.40 --> 01:17:27.04
inside. It's novel outside. It's novel, exactly. It's cool to do sometimes. And at my old house,

628
01:17:27.04 --> 01:17:32.40
I had like a full outdoor jujitsu area, which was cool. And I had a shade structure over it. It was good.

629
01:17:32.40 --> 01:17:36.64
It was good. But you have to have something to that extent before it's not like you can just

630
01:17:37.28 --> 01:17:42.000
do jujitsu outside and you can do it. It's, but it's novel. And you know how to, you know,

631
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.36
what, if you do an in grass, you get the grass edges. Yeah. For some reason, I don't know what it is

632
01:17:47.36 --> 01:17:51.76
when you do jujitsu in grass, you're all itchy. Yeah. But even that's kind of not, you know how like,

633
01:17:52.96 --> 01:17:57.04
this is more when you're younger. You know, when you first learn jujitsu, oh, yeah, when you first

634
01:17:57.04 --> 01:18:02.40
learn and you're doing jujitsu every year. And you're at the party and everything's at that when you're a blue bell.

635
01:18:02.40 --> 01:18:08.16
You're just looking at everything like to mat. And yeah. So I think I think with other people,

636
01:18:09.44 --> 01:18:12.56
you know, some people obviously are not by the ocean, but you know, with anything outside,

637
01:18:12.56 --> 01:18:18.40
running hiking, biking, swimming, even playing outdoor sports, like soccer, and shooting basketball

638
01:18:18.40 --> 01:18:26.08
outside. This is whatever. Just get outside, just get outside, get out in the air, feel it. And I'll

639
01:18:26.08 --> 01:18:31.04
say one more thing about jujitsu and surfing. There's a little connection there. There's a little

640
01:18:31.04 --> 01:18:35.60
connection between jujitsu and surfing. I don't know what it is. Do you know what it is? What is

641
01:18:35.60 --> 01:18:43.76
balance? Well, you know, you got like even Kelly Slater who's, you know, what is either 11-time, 12-time

642
01:18:43.76 --> 01:18:51.28
champion of the world in surfing? He does jujitsu. You got guys like Joel Tutor. JT, if you don't know

643
01:18:51.28 --> 01:19:01.04
who Joel Tutor is, he's just legendary longboard surfer. And actually he's from San Diego. So we

644
01:19:01.04 --> 01:19:06.56
kick it with JT from time to time. And actually I see him on a regular basis. I had to,

645
01:19:06.56 --> 01:19:11.84
that the longboard surfing contest, because both his kid and my kid surf in the long, on the long

646
01:19:11.84 --> 01:19:17.92
boards. But Joel Tutor, who's a, who's a literally one of the most, you know, many people

647
01:19:17.92 --> 01:19:23.36
consider him to be the best longboard surfer of all time. Oh, dang. Of all time. Yeah, you didn't

648
01:19:23.36 --> 01:19:28.64
know he was that good. Did you? I knew he, all the time I didn't know that, but I believe it. And I'm

649
01:19:28.64 --> 01:19:32.48
not going to make that declaration, because then a million people will say no, it should be this

650
01:19:32.48 --> 01:19:38.48
guy. But there are many, there are many people in the world who consider Joel Tutor to be the best

651
01:19:38.48 --> 01:19:45.20
longboard surfer of all time. I met, I met Joel Tutor in jujitsu. You just started coming in and

652
01:19:45.20 --> 01:19:49.92
he, there was Shannon was like, Hey, roll with him. He's good at jujitsu. So I was like, Oh, cool.

653
01:19:49.92 --> 01:19:52.96
He was like a brown belt at the time and I roll and he's really good at jujitsu. And I was like,

654
01:19:52.96 --> 01:19:57.12
I'll get a cool Joel. And I see him during the day. It's like Melal group and he'd come to

655
01:19:57.12 --> 01:20:02.40
the end, roll with Joel sometime. Yeah. Really cool, Joel Tutor. He's this kind of guy who's smaller

656
01:20:02.40 --> 01:20:07.60
than me. We'll say. And he's better than me. Cool. Cool. One day, you know, who told me,

657
01:20:07.60 --> 01:20:12.64
Joel Tutor was a badass longboarder? Who? Kagnets. Kagnets? Is that Joel Tutor in that big

658
01:20:12.64 --> 01:20:17.44
guy? Is that what you in to under? Like, yeah, you know, he's probably a longboarder. He's so badass.

659
01:20:17.44 --> 01:20:26.32
Yeah. Yeah. And, and not as he's so awesome at surfing. He's jujitsu sick too. So Joel Tutor's

660
01:20:26.32 --> 01:20:30.16
one and then you get, then once you go, once you go Brazil, you know, in this scenario,

661
01:20:30.16 --> 01:20:33.04
then there's all kinds of surfing going on because that's a culture down there, you know,

662
01:20:33.04 --> 01:20:39.28
my first instructor, Fabio Santos. He's a, he's a badass surfer, Holy Lord Hicks and

663
01:20:39.28 --> 01:20:47.44
even kid Palagro. He's yeah. So, so there's definitely an end when you just meet

664
01:20:47.44 --> 01:20:53.36
guys surfing. There's like a decent chance that they train the jujitsu. Right. And so you said,

665
01:20:53.36 --> 01:20:58.40
you know what the connection is? I know of some connections, yes, which major ones.

666
01:20:58.40 --> 01:21:08.64
So educate. Okay. So me. It's one of these things where kind of on the surface, it feels like you

667
01:21:08.64 --> 01:21:16.72
against this big wash of a challenge, right? But really, it's not, it's not like this challenge

668
01:21:16.72 --> 01:21:21.84
that you take on. It's more of a challenge that you kind of just ride with. You know, it's more

669
01:21:21.84 --> 01:21:26.88
you yourself. So in and on top of it, and that could be an effective mountain climbing, whatever, but

670
01:21:28.16 --> 01:21:34.72
this is jujitsu and surfing is it always changes. It's not different. It may seem, same in one

671
01:21:34.72 --> 01:21:39.68
where another, it's same, but every single experience is different. Yeah. And it's not something

672
01:21:39.68 --> 01:21:45.44
you can just take control of. You know, it's not one of those things. It's you have to, you have to

673
01:21:45.44 --> 01:21:50.88
ride the weight. Yes. And surfing is literally in jujitsu. It's, you gotta go with it. You can't fight

674
01:21:50.88 --> 01:21:56.000
it. Just like you can't fight away. If you got it and it's, and they're both that. Yes. So of course,

675
01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.32
yeah, they take balance. But those are just little small physical, right? Because others force to balance.

676
01:22:00.32 --> 01:22:05.92
I don't do it. Yeah. But yeah, it's, it's you. I mean, it's kind of a spiritual type thing to say.

677
01:22:05.92 --> 01:22:12.40
It's you against yourself. Right. But that's really what it is. It's like you have to improve

678
01:22:12.40 --> 01:22:18.000
yourself. You know, it's not about conquering this, you know, maybe psychologically it is,

679
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.88
but it's still within yourself. And it, and it's constantly changing. That's,

680
01:22:22.88 --> 01:22:30.16
getting philosophical. It's true. But I like it. Yeah. That's good. And my last comment on that was

681
01:22:30.16 --> 01:22:36.08
both of them, both surfing and jujitsu. Empty your brain. They empty my brain out. They empty my brain

682
01:22:36.08 --> 01:22:42.80
out. And they, they give me nice clean slate to do other things with. So that's that.

683
01:22:45.44 --> 01:22:51.12
All right. For the record, it come from Koi, but sorry, say I don't serve. Yeah. But,

684
01:22:51.12 --> 01:22:59.76
bra, I used to shred body, body, body and body, sponge. Yeah, total sponge. Oh, and by the way,

685
01:23:01.20 --> 01:23:06.80
it's my man, not why me. Oh, I, I'm not I'm correcting you because you're my friend.

686
01:23:08.08 --> 01:23:12.24
But I don't want to be a character. That's no correct. Correct. Correct. You mean,

687
01:23:12.24 --> 01:23:16.40
okay. Yeah. Absolutely. Why me. I guess, right? It's just pronunciation. Yeah.

688
01:23:16.40 --> 01:23:21.60
Don't let me up. But I'm wondering, go, what can I say? Why, man. Why, man. Be. Oh, I am.

689
01:23:24.88 --> 01:23:30.56
If you be a character too much, you become the guy that people are tolerating. So you don't want

690
01:23:30.56 --> 01:23:35.20
to be the guy at the party that people are tolerating. You don't want to be that guy. No matter how smart

691
01:23:35.20 --> 01:23:40.08
you want them to think you are, well, you just proved your, your intelligence. You gave me permission.

692
01:23:40.08 --> 01:23:46.80
All right. Next question. Started jujitsu this week and love it.

693
01:23:48.08 --> 01:23:52.88
I'm a former boxer and was thrilled that they let me spar on my first day.

694
01:23:52.88 --> 01:23:58.08
Is sparring on the first day too soon in your opinion? I was repeatedly told to tone it down

695
01:23:58.08 --> 01:24:05.44
by the higher belts. I thought I was tone in it down. Is jujitsu more like a dance or a street

696
01:24:05.44 --> 01:24:10.96
tuzzle? Am I supposed to relax and let these green and blue belts destroy me? I'm confused.

697
01:24:12.96 --> 01:24:16.72
This is such a great question. Because you see this all the time and you're just doing it.

698
01:24:16.72 --> 01:24:20.32
And I know from the from the podcast and from Twitter that there's so many people that are

699
01:24:20.32 --> 01:24:25.28
starting jujitsu because the podcast and that's definitely why I wanted to answer this one.

700
01:24:25.84 --> 01:24:31.52
Because it's how everybody feels when they start you. And you're always going to get

701
01:24:31.52 --> 01:24:37.44
the senior belts or the more experienced people telling you, hey man, you got to relax.

702
01:24:37.84 --> 01:24:43.12
By the way, if he's rolling with green belts, that means he's rolling with people under the age of 16.

703
01:24:43.12 --> 01:24:51.68
Yeah, you know, I actually had a little discussion. I've heard that there's some academies

704
01:24:51.68 --> 01:24:57.84
that give out green belts as an intermediate belt between white and blue. That there's a

705
01:24:57.84 --> 01:25:02.16
adults such. I have never heard of it, but I was told that the other day so that might be the

706
01:25:02.16 --> 01:25:06.72
situation here. Yeah, and by the way, I'll just go on record of saying, I disagree with it.

707
01:25:07.44 --> 01:25:12.88
Yeah, and you don't have a green belt as an adult. You should be white belt and then blue belt.

708
01:25:12.88 --> 01:25:17.52
That's the way it was and that's the way it should remain. Yeah, if I were in instructor,

709
01:25:17.52 --> 01:25:22.64
that's how it would do. But to me, hey man, do what you dig and he's doing jujitsu and the

710
01:25:22.64 --> 01:25:28.56
green belt. Yeah, that's the way it's been. In fact, he's an adult. He's doing jujitsu. Apparently long enough to get a green belt.

711
01:25:28.56 --> 01:25:34.32
I say hey. No, no, he's not a blue belt. Yeah, right. But he's got some guy in the event of this green belt that he's

712
01:25:34.32 --> 01:25:41.52
mentioned being an adult. Okay. Either way, I say, I say go do so. So yeah, now that now the reason that

713
01:25:41.52 --> 01:25:47.04
people are telling you to relax, they're trying to be helpful because you're going to learn more

714
01:25:47.04 --> 01:25:52.88
if you relax and you actually concentrate on the techniques that you've been told. The couple techniques

715
01:25:52.88 --> 01:26:01.28
that you've learned to try them. I'm not saying don't fight it because you, you have, you don't know what

716
01:26:01.28 --> 01:26:08.08
else to do. So you just use your horrible instincts to try and just muscle out of stuff and you

717
01:26:08.08 --> 01:26:13.44
get beat anyways. And that's why it's you're just beating your head against the wall. So they're trying

718
01:26:13.44 --> 01:26:17.52
to get you to relax and use the technique that you've learned and pay attention to what the other

719
01:26:17.52 --> 01:26:24.16
person's doing and think about where they're positioning their body and what they're doing and how

720
01:26:24.16 --> 01:26:28.56
that's working. So you can actually ask them and say hey, when you were holding me here, I couldn't

721
01:26:28.56 --> 01:26:32.80
move my arm. How are you holding that? So you can learn. If all you're trying to do is muscle out of it,

722
01:26:32.80 --> 01:26:38.48
you're not thinking about what's happening and that's, that's not a good sign. Yeah, I think it's

723
01:26:38.48 --> 01:26:42.80
funny because relax, you know, when you hear relax as a, as a way out enough, you're even remember

724
01:26:42.80 --> 01:26:52.32
when you're away, but when they say relax, more accurately put, they should say, not they should say,

725
01:26:52.32 --> 01:26:58.56
but they're saying try to relax. Yes. We know everyone knows, they guys not going to relax.

726
01:26:58.56 --> 01:27:03.12
He's over here rolling with a guy. He doesn't know anything. Of course, guys in Mount, which is like,

727
01:27:03.12 --> 01:27:07.36
you know, super uncomfortable with being, of course, he can be trying to flip out, try to get out of

728
01:27:07.36 --> 01:27:12.40
there. He doesn't know the moves. So he can't be like, you know, I'm going to relax and do all the moves.

729
01:27:12.40 --> 01:27:20.40
I know. He knows two moves. He's his first day, whatever. So yeah, try to relax. And I think that's a

730
01:27:20.40 --> 01:27:25.44
good point where don't be going so hard in spashing out. So hard that nothing's going through

731
01:27:25.44 --> 01:27:31.76
your mind as far as what position is this guy on me. You know, I remember not my first first day,

732
01:27:31.76 --> 01:27:38.08
but early on where side control, I barely even realized the difference between a side control and a,

733
01:27:38.08 --> 01:27:43.84
you know, half guard situation. And that's one of the things that as time went on, I wish I would

734
01:27:43.84 --> 01:27:50.16
had known, you know, like, okay, this is side control. And if you would have been more aware and less

735
01:27:50.16 --> 01:27:54.32
fighting, right? You would have said, oh, wait, he's got my leg trap. That's what feels different.

736
01:27:54.32 --> 01:27:58.80
Exactly. Right. That's the game. You got to you got to switch your game to this side control game.

737
01:27:58.80 --> 01:28:05.60
You know, yep. And what's telling someone, am I supposed to let these green and blue belts

738
01:28:05.60 --> 01:28:12.72
destroy you? No, but you got to remember, you can't look at it like a fight. It's not a fight.

739
01:28:12.72 --> 01:28:17.52
Yeah. It's not a fight. You know what it is? Don't let them destroy you. Let them educate you.

740
01:28:18.48 --> 01:28:22.16
That's what when you're rolling with a higher belt, especially when you don't know them very much at

741
01:28:22.16 --> 01:28:28.32
all, they're educating you. You should be trying to pay attention. And let's just take this off

742
01:28:28.32 --> 01:28:36.40
the mats and in the life. Because when you get into a situation, an unknown situation, what are you

743
01:28:36.40 --> 01:28:41.12
going to do? Are you going to fight and struggle against when someone has more knowledge than you

744
01:28:41.12 --> 01:28:47.12
about some topic? Are you going to fight against them? No, just be quiet. Listen, and learn.

745
01:28:47.84 --> 01:28:52.40
When you're in a new scenario, you're something you've never done before. Are you going to

746
01:28:52.40 --> 01:28:56.40
try and compete and win? And this thing you've never done before? Are you going to try and learn and

747
01:28:56.40 --> 01:29:00.40
be educated? My recommendation is to learn to be educated because you're not going to win.

748
01:29:01.92 --> 01:29:10.96
Lest it's a miracle, but most situations don't allow for miracles. So when you're in life,

749
01:29:10.96 --> 01:29:17.76
relax, try and learn. When you're on the mat, relax, try and learn. Try to really try to

750
01:29:17.76 --> 01:29:26.32
relax. You've got to try and relax. It's here. And when I don't, maybe it's just me, but when I think

751
01:29:26.32 --> 01:29:31.28
of the whole spectrum, when I first started versus you just right now, and of course, I don't

752
01:29:31.28 --> 01:29:38.88
have it all figured out. But when I kind of reflect on that whole learning process, I like the fact that

753
01:29:39.60 --> 01:29:44.88
I couldn't really relax at the beginning because you start to realize, oh, I see how I learned

754
01:29:44.88 --> 01:29:51.52
that right there. You know, I see how I see the difference now in the time where I didn't really know

755
01:29:51.52 --> 01:29:56.000
how to relax versus even like the time where I thought I knew how to relax, but after, you know,

756
01:29:56.56 --> 01:30:02.72
a 10 minutes, oh, dying versus, you know, now where you can go 10, 20 hard, you know,

757
01:30:02.72 --> 01:30:06.80
in fine place where you could relax and be able to basically control the scenarios where you can't

758
01:30:06.80 --> 01:30:11.28
relax. I like that. I like that the beginning, you can't relax. This is like in the beginning,

759
01:30:11.28 --> 01:30:16.24
you didn't know certain relaxing is yet another move. Yeah, there you go.

760
01:30:16.24 --> 01:30:22.96
Yeah, I rolled with Dean tonight, Dean Lester, and he was all fired up because he'd been on the

761
01:30:22.96 --> 01:30:32.08
trip. And so he's like, Hey, let's roll. So we rolled and he got the mountain position.

762
01:30:32.96 --> 01:30:37.68
And I just was down there relaxing speaking of relaxing. I was just down there relaxing. And

763
01:30:37.68 --> 01:30:45.28
I'm relaxing, but I'm just doing a little bit of off-balancing of him. So he can't really relax

764
01:30:45.28 --> 01:30:52.88
100%. And it took me a few minutes, like about five, but I got out of the mountain and got back

765
01:30:52.88 --> 01:30:58.16
to another position and got back to the car. So it's, you're right, relaxing is actually a technique in

766
01:30:58.16 --> 01:31:07.44
Gigiitsu. Yeah. So in a big part of it, not the whole thing, but a big part of it is just being conscious of it.

767
01:31:07.44 --> 01:31:12.64
You know, maybe I'm spashing too much or something. Of course, with everything it's going to come

768
01:31:12.64 --> 01:31:16.72
with wraps, it's going to come with experience and stuff like that. But yeah. And by the way, Dean would tell

769
01:31:16.72 --> 01:31:23.36
you, and I would tend to agree with him, not only to relaxing a technique, spashing is almost

770
01:31:23.36 --> 01:31:29.76
so attacking. And sometimes, you know, Dean will get some position on me and I will spas to get out of it.

771
01:31:29.76 --> 01:31:33.76
Now, I'm not encouraging the person that wrote this question to start working on their spas technique.

772
01:31:33.76 --> 01:31:38.80
Don't start working on that till later. Save that right now. Start with your relaxed technique.

773
01:31:38.80 --> 01:31:42.40
Yeah. Yeah. All right. Next question.

774
01:31:45.04 --> 01:31:51.44
In regards to podcast number 23 in the art of war, many of the rules seem very simplistic and

775
01:31:51.44 --> 01:31:56.48
black and white. Take this one, for example. When the enemy occupies high ground, do not confront

776
01:31:56.48 --> 01:32:03.44
him. If he attacks downhill, do not oppose him. Where does that leave us with battles like Normandy,

777
01:32:03.44 --> 01:32:11.76
where troops had to get up those cliffs? What about the IDF conquering the Goalon, Goalon,

778
01:32:11.76 --> 01:32:19.12
Goalon Heights? Goalon Heights in the sixth day war. There are many other examples I could give.

779
01:32:19.12 --> 01:32:24.24
It's obviously not ideal to do such things as fighting a well-intrenched enemy uphill,

780
01:32:24.24 --> 01:32:28.80
but dealing with less than ideal situations is a part of war.

781
01:32:30.24 --> 01:32:35.76
We should all be so lucky as to only be able to choose battles that fit the art of war.

782
01:32:35.76 --> 01:32:40.000
But from my experience, it's often not an option in real life.

783
01:32:41.60 --> 01:32:46.80
And you have to somehow get it done anyway. So yeah, this is a pretty simple question with a

784
01:32:46.80 --> 01:32:54.32
pretty simple answer to. Don't forget that the laws or the the art of war and the laws and the

785
01:32:54.32 --> 01:33:00.40
art of war, the rules, the simplistic back and white rules in the art of war are governed by

786
01:33:00.40 --> 01:33:07.44
other rules that say to break the rules themselves. So just to pull out a couple quotes,

787
01:33:07.44 --> 01:33:14.32
I went and pulled these out. Sunsu says, he who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent

788
01:33:14.32 --> 01:33:22.40
and thereby succeed in winning may be called a heaven-born captain. So if you can adapt

789
01:33:23.20 --> 01:33:29.92
to the situation, then adapt your tactics and modify your tactics. So attacking uphill is a

790
01:33:29.92 --> 01:33:36.96
modification of a tactic, right? Yes. The next one I pulled out. Sunsu says,

791
01:33:36.96 --> 01:33:44.88
do not repeat tactics that have gained you one victory. But let your methods be regulated by the

792
01:33:44.88 --> 01:33:55.52
infinite variety of circumstances. That answers the question in its own right. Let your methods

793
01:33:55.52 --> 01:34:03.52
be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances. And the last little quote I pulled up from

794
01:34:03.52 --> 01:34:12.32
Sunsu, according as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans. So there's three

795
01:34:12.32 --> 01:34:21.84
rules from the art of war that tell you to change the rules of the art of war when you have to.

796
01:34:21.84 --> 01:34:29.20
So yeah, you're told to avoid these situations, but sometimes you have to. Now it's also

797
01:34:29.20 --> 01:34:38.80
important to remember that the philosophy of the art of war generally espouses an indirect methodology

798
01:34:38.80 --> 01:34:49.84
of combat, where oftentimes you're trying to keep yourself safe and inflict damage when you can.

799
01:34:49.84 --> 01:34:58.48
That implies that maybe I have less physical strength or size than my opponent. So I've less

800
01:34:58.48 --> 01:35:04.40
soldiers or less equipment than my opponent. And from that perspective, let me ask you

801
01:35:04.40 --> 01:35:12.000
to would it be smart to attack Normandy if you actually didn't have the numbers to carry out the

802
01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:18.08
attack? You didn't have the overwhelming force that we had a mast on England to go in a

803
01:35:18.08 --> 01:35:27.44
sole France. It wouldn't make sense. Then it would make sense to continue to obey the principles

804
01:35:27.44 --> 01:35:31.28
in the art of war, which is you know what we're not going to attack head on. We're going to figure

805
01:35:31.28 --> 01:35:41.44
out another way to do it. So like I said, these are rules, but these are rules like all rules

806
01:35:41.44 --> 01:35:48.16
that are meant to be broken when the time calls for it. So good question, but it's a, it's a,

807
01:35:48.88 --> 01:35:53.12
the art of war answers that question in itself.

808
01:35:57.44 --> 01:36:04.32
Jockel, how do the seals reconcile themselves with the fact they face death on every

809
01:36:04.32 --> 01:36:10.88
operation they undertake more so than the conventional forces? Is this something that is learned?

810
01:36:12.64 --> 01:36:18.32
Well, first of all, let me make it perfectly clear that this is not true. What is it? Well,

811
01:36:18.32 --> 01:36:23.68
first of all, the part that you face death on every operation, there's a little chance, but further

812
01:36:23.68 --> 01:36:32.96
more and more importantly, this idea that the seals or special operations unit face death more

813
01:36:32.96 --> 01:36:40.88
so than conventional forces, not true. In fact, in many cases seals are safer than the conventional

814
01:36:40.88 --> 01:36:48.72
forces. The conventional forces are out there doing very difficult operations that are oftentimes

815
01:36:48.72 --> 01:36:53.68
more dangerous. I mean, even just something as simple as going on a logistics convoy.

816
01:36:55.36 --> 01:37:01.28
You are, I mean, I reckon Afghanistan, you are extremely exposed in those situations. You're on the

817
01:37:01.28 --> 01:37:05.60
defensive because you're in a convoy. You're just waiting to get blown up.

818
01:37:07.20 --> 01:37:16.16
And so that situation is you're facing your much, you're much more exposed in that situation

819
01:37:16.16 --> 01:37:24.56
doing a daytime convoy run down ID roads, then you would be if you were doing a night patrol

820
01:37:25.36 --> 01:37:28.72
through the same area. There's just, that's just the way it is. I mean, there's other operations,

821
01:37:28.72 --> 01:37:32.96
too, I mean, presence patrols and senses operations. There's all kinds of

822
01:37:34.24 --> 01:37:41.04
operations that the conventional units do that are extremely dangerous. They also oftentimes have

823
01:37:41.04 --> 01:37:50.24
less support. So for instance, there's an aircraft called an AC 130 that is just a miraculous

824
01:37:50.24 --> 01:37:59.04
piece of equipment, just an incredible weapon system. And it's an airplane that flies around a 10,000

825
01:37:59.04 --> 01:38:07.12
feet and it can see everything because as these incredible, incredible imagery systems on it.

826
01:38:07.12 --> 01:38:10.80
So they can see everything that's happening, they can track, they can end and they can shoot and

827
01:38:10.80 --> 01:38:17.12
destroy anything they want. So a lot of times the special operations units will have

828
01:38:17.12 --> 01:38:23.92
for instance something like an AC 130 supporting them. You know, on top of that, special operations

829
01:38:23.92 --> 01:38:30.56
they get really good training. So you've got this, this, out-send of the conventional forces

830
01:38:30.56 --> 01:38:34.16
often have great training as well, but sometimes they don't have the best training in the world.

831
01:38:34.88 --> 01:38:38.72
Then you're in a, you're in a sea of puttons or you're in a special operations,

832
01:38:38.72 --> 01:38:44.32
you know, in a special forces ODA, you can have some good training under your belt that you've

833
01:38:44.32 --> 01:38:50.08
been going through for many, many years so that training makes you say for as well. And, you know,

834
01:38:50.08 --> 01:38:54.72
you're going to get oftentimes again, you're going to get better gear in special operations

835
01:38:54.72 --> 01:38:59.76
because they have a big budget for a smaller number of people. The logistical support,

836
01:38:59.76 --> 01:39:07.92
the flexibility that you have in special operations is usually, it's usually better. I mean,

837
01:39:07.92 --> 01:39:14.96
like the logistics in the army or the Marine Corps is awesome and and it definitely is better than

838
01:39:14.96 --> 01:39:20.80
special operations, but special operations is usually is always supporting a much smaller unit.

839
01:39:20.80 --> 01:39:27.20
So even though the logistics people or systems might not be as good, they're overwhelmingly good

840
01:39:27.20 --> 01:39:35.28
for the small number of people that are in special operations. So, you know, I'll just go one step further.

841
01:39:35.28 --> 01:39:40.56
A lot of times, you know, in Ramadi, the conventional guys, they were living out in the city.

842
01:39:41.68 --> 01:39:46.32
They were living out in the city of Ramadi after we put combat outposts in place. You know,

843
01:39:46.32 --> 01:39:51.12
we seals would return to base after a few days out in the field. These guys stayed out there.

844
01:39:51.60 --> 01:39:57.20
So we'd return back and, you know, get it, get a shower and get some good food and

845
01:39:57.20 --> 01:40:02.000
relax and we had permanent guards that kind of guarded our base with a really big perimeter.

846
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.48
So we were in a good spot to stand down for the most part.

847
01:40:07.76 --> 01:40:11.92
Whereas the conventional guys, they're out there in Ramadi. They're standing watch, you know,

848
01:40:11.92 --> 01:40:16.40
oh, you know, we go back and can take a break and go on the internet. When they take a break,

849
01:40:16.40 --> 01:40:22.40
they're going into a watch tower. So I just don't, I just want to make sure I make it perfectly clear

850
01:40:22.40 --> 01:40:30.16
that, you know, the conventional's are by no means doing anything less risky than the special

851
01:40:30.16 --> 01:40:34.16
operations. In fact, most of the time they're doing things that are more risky.

852
01:40:34.16 --> 01:40:44.56
Tough formations, higher risk, you know, that's just the way it is. So that's why, you know,

853
01:40:44.56 --> 01:40:51.20
we have just the utmost respect and admiration for the conventional units that we work with in Ramadi.

854
01:40:51.20 --> 01:40:58.16
And I'll tell you the guys, that's how we feel. So now the question becomes, how do we

855
01:40:58.16 --> 01:41:06.72
any service member face death is the question? And again, it's any service member.

856
01:41:06.72 --> 01:41:11.44
Anybody that's going to war has to realize that there's a possibility that they could get killed.

857
01:41:12.72 --> 01:41:19.44
And so what do you, how do you get over that? For me, it was acceptance and saying to myself,

858
01:41:19.44 --> 01:41:26.72
you know what? Okay, I could get killed and it could happen tonight. It could happen tomorrow.

859
01:41:26.72 --> 01:41:30.32
It could happen in a week. I don't know when it's going to happen, but it could happen.

860
01:41:31.04 --> 01:41:37.60
And you know what? I'm not afraid of it. So if I'm afraid of it, that's going to be hard to

861
01:41:37.60 --> 01:41:44.96
deal with every single day. The other piece of it is, you deal with it by mitigating as much

862
01:41:44.96 --> 01:41:48.40
risk as you possibly can. Okay, what can we do? How can I make sure that I'm safe? You know,

863
01:41:48.40 --> 01:41:52.64
how I make sure that I'm safe? I can say it's a possible. I train hard. I make sure my guys

864
01:41:52.64 --> 01:41:58.16
are training hard. I make sure my guys are dieted and I make sure that they know what the plan is

865
01:41:58.16 --> 01:42:04.48
when we go out of the battlefield. That's what you do. You mitigate as much risk as you can. And then

866
01:42:05.04 --> 01:42:11.20
there's areas where you can't mitigate risk. There's areas where you could catch a,

867
01:42:11.20 --> 01:42:19.92
you could find an ID, you could find a bullet, you could find a bomb and that's it.

868
01:42:19.92 --> 01:42:28.16
And you can't, in my mind, you can't worry about things that you can't control.

869
01:42:29.44 --> 01:42:34.96
So the things that you can't control, accept them and let's focus on mitigating what we

870
01:42:34.96 --> 01:42:42.80
came control. And I think that's probably, that's what I did when I was in those situations.

871
01:42:42.80 --> 01:42:48.56
And I would tell you that that's what most of the guys that I was with had something along those

872
01:42:48.56 --> 01:42:58.72
lines in their brains. Yeah, that acceptance is such a powerful thing. Like if you just accept

873
01:42:58.72 --> 01:43:09.12
something like, okay, I'm at risk of this or I'm like, this is going to be a terrible crude example,

874
01:43:09.12 --> 01:43:15.12
comparatively speaking compared to what? Compared to accepting the risk of death. But let's hear it.

875
01:43:15.12 --> 01:43:22.40
Let's say you, you missed it a long example. Let's see, you go to work. The fans wanted to say that.

876
01:43:22.40 --> 01:43:26.64
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, let's say you go to work and right when you walk in one of

877
01:43:26.64 --> 01:43:31.68
your coworkers and him and John, your boss is looking for you. He's going to, and you know, you did

878
01:43:31.68 --> 01:43:35.36
something you messed it up. You blew up some meeting. I don't know, whatever messed up with the claim.

879
01:43:36.48 --> 01:43:40.40
You're like, hey man, the boss is looking for you. And you're like, yeah, I was just so you're going

880
01:43:40.40 --> 01:43:45.76
to avoid the boss at all costs. Oh, that's good. Make sure you don't. Yeah. So let's say you avoid them one day.

881
01:43:45.76 --> 01:43:50.48
The whole day, boom, you've clocked out your out. Next day, same thing. Oh, she's looking for even

882
01:43:50.48 --> 01:43:56.24
more even more even more after a while. It's going to weigh on you. And once you just feel like,

883
01:43:56.24 --> 01:44:01.44
I'm going to get chewed out. Let me just accept it. And then, you know, you can go through it.

884
01:44:02.64 --> 01:44:09.20
Stress is gone. Yeah. Really. Yeah. Um, analogy accepted. Yeah.

885
01:44:09.20 --> 01:44:15.28
Oh, or like, for example, oh, oh, it's like a bully is looking for you. Yeah, let's go.

886
01:44:15.28 --> 01:44:19.36
Yeah. Like, you know, well, I don't know if you've been bullied in school, but um, like,

887
01:44:19.36 --> 01:44:22.88
if someone's looking for you, they're mad at you or whatever. And you know, they're looking for you.

888
01:44:22.88 --> 01:44:27.12
The bully. And you're like, man, you're avoiding when you're avoiding them. After why you just

889
01:44:27.12 --> 01:44:31.20
all right, I accept it. You know, something's going to have to go down. I'm going to have to

890
01:44:31.20 --> 01:44:35.44
experience this confrontation. Yeah. In really the acceptance point would be to say, you know,

891
01:44:35.44 --> 01:44:38.80
what, what's the worst thing that could happen? The worst thing that happened. He beats me up. I

892
01:44:38.80 --> 01:44:44.000
get a bloody nose. I don't care anymore. I'm going to go get it. Yeah. Because what you're talking

893
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.80
about really is facing the problem, which I also support. You know what, you got a problem, whether

894
01:44:48.80 --> 01:44:52.80
it's meeting with your boss or what you're going to get bullied, I'm going to face that problem.

895
01:44:52.80 --> 01:44:57.28
So that's one piece. But one thing that will help you to face the problem is saying,

896
01:44:57.28 --> 01:45:01.68
okay, what's the worst thing that happens? You know what, I go into my boss. He might fire me.

897
01:45:01.68 --> 01:45:04.64
Okay, if he fires me, I'm going to have to go get a new job. But that's the worst thing that's

898
01:45:04.64 --> 01:45:08.08
going to happen. Right. What's the worst thing that happens if I get into fight with a bully?

899
01:45:08.08 --> 01:45:12.48
Worst thing that happens. I'm going to get a bloody nose and we'll get beat up. Yeah. But you know what,

900
01:45:13.04 --> 01:45:17.76
I can handle that. So I'm going to go face this issue. And it's the same thing in combat. What's the

901
01:45:17.76 --> 01:45:24.16
worst thing that happens? Worst thing that happens? I'm going to get killed. Okay. That happens. It's

902
01:45:24.16 --> 01:45:29.36
over. I'm good with it. Let's go out and face it. And you know, honestly, I said it's the worst thing,

903
01:45:29.36 --> 01:45:33.28
but honestly, the thing that guys are usually the most afraid of is having their friends get

904
01:45:33.28 --> 01:45:38.48
her, they're guys get hurt. That's the worst thing. Yeah. So, bully. And then even how you said

905
01:45:38.48 --> 01:45:45.44
that the training helps. And that seems obvious, you know, but I think even that is, that's like

906
01:45:45.44 --> 01:45:50.88
it kind of an understated. I think under appreciated. Because you know, like remember,

907
01:45:50.88 --> 01:45:56.24
for USC came out. And I remember looking and being that poor. These guys are nuts to go in there

908
01:45:56.24 --> 01:46:04.32
to do that. But once you learn even just some jujitsu, just some jujitsu, you think that what you see,

909
01:46:04.32 --> 01:46:08.88
like them fighting in the USC and stuff like that's I could do that. Yeah. You all, yeah. And actually

910
01:46:08.88 --> 01:46:13.12
that's one of the reasons why I started, I started jujitsu. I didn't start jujitsu. I want to be a fighter.

911
01:46:13.12 --> 01:46:19.12
So I trained in MMA first. And before training that, I would have thought you're

912
01:46:19.12 --> 01:46:23.84
completely insane to do that. You got to be like kind of crazy person. But once you have the

913
01:46:23.84 --> 01:46:28.72
training, you see, okay, you know, kind of just, yeah, you get a normal life. You see, like, okay, I see all this

914
01:46:28.72 --> 01:46:36.32
stuff. You have just a just a vast understanding rather than all you see is knuckles and blood and arms

915
01:46:36.32 --> 01:46:48.000
breaking. That's the next question. Jockel, good evening. In a leadership position, is it okay to take

916
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:55.36
or ask for suggestions on solving a task or is it okay to take suggestions that stray from my initial

917
01:46:55.36 --> 01:47:10.88
plan? Yes. Yes. And I hope that this that would made you decide to ask this question because you just

918
01:47:10.88 --> 01:47:19.12
like found out about the podcast or the book or whatever because this is something that absolutely

919
01:47:19.12 --> 01:47:25.60
anybody that kind of listens will would say yes, absolutely. In your leadership position,

920
01:47:26.64 --> 01:47:34.08
you should definitely ask for suggestions, take suggestions, share the planning,

921
01:47:34.08 --> 01:47:41.36
let other people let many brains be smarter than your one brain. That's what you want. You want

922
01:47:41.36 --> 01:47:46.48
to utilize the brain power of your team. Now, the reason you're asking this question,

923
01:47:47.12 --> 01:47:50.80
little bit scary, little bit of a red flag. The reason you're asking this question is because you're

924
01:47:50.80 --> 01:47:56.24
afraid of what it'll look like if you have to ask, hey, guys, I'm not sure how to do this or

925
01:47:56.24 --> 01:48:01.20
you're afraid of what it means that you're going to look that you're going to look weak. You're

926
01:48:01.20 --> 01:48:05.52
going to look like a weak leader. That's your experience. That's your inner experience. That's your

927
01:48:05.52 --> 01:48:12.64
insecurity. That's making that happen. Don't be insecure. Don't be insecure because the open mind

928
01:48:12.64 --> 01:48:18.000
and the asking for suggestions and the taking suggestions, it actually makes you look like a

929
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.76
better leader. I know that sounds crazy. It actually makes you look like a better leader when you say,

930
01:48:23.76 --> 01:48:28.32
hey, you know what, echo, we got this problem a soft, not 100% sure how to tackle this one. Can

931
01:48:28.32 --> 01:48:34.000
you give me a hand? Can you give me some suggestions here? That doesn't make you say, oh,

932
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.72
Jocca doesn't know his game. He's an idiot. No, because I'm a man. Jocca was humble. He's looking for

933
01:48:38.72 --> 01:48:51.36
input. He wants to work together as a team. So, yes, absolutely. Ask for suggestions, take suggestions,

934
01:48:51.36 --> 01:48:59.76
have an open mind. This regard your plan if your plan wasn't good. I'm not just going to hold

935
01:48:59.76 --> 01:49:06.08
fast to a plan because I'm the one that thought of it. That's not good leadership at all. Don't

936
01:49:06.08 --> 01:49:16.56
do that. Open your mind. Yeah. Yeah, I'm asking for asking for suggestions. And this kind of kind

937
01:49:16.56 --> 01:49:24.56
of what you said already is it helps with making everyone feel even more involved. Oh, you mean

938
01:49:24.56 --> 01:49:29.52
it spreads the ownership throughout the team? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Lead echo Charles. Yeah. And

939
01:49:29.52 --> 01:49:36.000
indeed, that improves. I know as like if, if, you know, you're leader, whatever, and the leader was asking

940
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:41.60
me for my input. And I gave it to him. And you know, any, I mean, I would feel just that much more valuable

941
01:49:41.60 --> 01:49:46.80
in part of the team. I'd be more enthusiastic now. Right. Now, who's going to work harder in a project?

942
01:49:46.80 --> 01:49:50.08
You, when I come in and say, hey, can you give me a hand? How do you think we should do this? And

943
01:49:50.08 --> 01:49:53.68
you come up with a suggestion and you start working on that plan? You're going to go a lot harder

944
01:49:53.68 --> 01:49:58.16
than if I come in and say, hey, here's what I want you to do. Follow my instructions. Yeah. As soon as

945
01:49:58.16 --> 01:50:03.60
you come up to an obstacle, and I've all I've told you do is follow my instructions. As soon as you

946
01:50:03.60 --> 01:50:08.08
come to an obstacle, you're going to be like, ah, you know what, A, I need, this isn't working. Right.

947
01:50:08.08 --> 01:50:14.32
Whereas if it was your plan, you come up to an obstacle, you tackle that thing. You get after it.

948
01:50:15.12 --> 01:50:19.84
That's what happens. You know, you know, you're saying like sometimes where, you know, as a leader,

949
01:50:19.84 --> 01:50:23.92
you might be reluctant to ask for suggestions because you might come up like an experience or something like that.

950
01:50:28.64 --> 01:50:33.44
If you need a suggestion and you're like, oh, I don't want to sound like that or whatever,

951
01:50:33.44 --> 01:50:38.08
and you say, you know, whatever, I'm just going to go hit move forward anyway. You know,

952
01:50:38.08 --> 01:50:42.40
and you're not know the best way to do it. Oh. And you're going to look dumb. And then you know,

953
01:50:42.40 --> 01:50:47.60
all like, we talked about this before, where if you don't know what you're doing, but you're acting like,

954
01:50:47.60 --> 01:50:52.000
you know, you're a pro. Just a transparent man. If you're way more transparent than you think, and that goes

955
01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.44
pretty much with everything you do. Right. It's like name droppers. You know, when people like drop

956
01:50:55.44 --> 01:50:59.68
names, they don't really think that people are going to pick up on it, but oh my gosh,

957
01:50:59.68 --> 01:51:03.52
smell that thing from one mile away, something he's out like tonight. I was like, well, you know,

958
01:51:03.52 --> 01:51:11.28
journalists, Twitter, doing what kicking it exactly up. Hey, it's been 26 podcasts. And I haven't talked

959
01:51:11.28 --> 01:51:18.80
about having done much name dropping. J. J. T. Joe, you're the first one. They drop in. You should say

960
01:51:18.80 --> 01:51:23.44
Joe Tudor, because you could be talking about J. T. T. T. T. Oh, no, I'm talking about Joe T. J. J. J. J. J.

961
01:51:23.44 --> 01:51:28.96
And I guess I dropped Jeffy Glovers name, but those guys, we we drop Greg Train's name, too.

962
01:51:28.96 --> 01:51:34.88
You know what I mean? We drop. We drop everybody. Like, everywhere that we train with, we

963
01:51:34.88 --> 01:51:40.72
we drop their names, but just no one knows who they are. Right. Yeah. So it's like Andy or big

964
01:51:40.72 --> 01:51:45.52
Eric. I mean, we talked about these guys. Well, technically, that wouldn't be named dropping

965
01:51:45.52 --> 01:51:49.76
them technically, like, name dropping, like, well, then Ian, but what if I said, hey, I was training

966
01:51:49.76 --> 01:51:53.52
with big Eric tonight, but it's such and such. Yeah, see if it's, but actually, it was

967
01:51:53.52 --> 01:51:57.68
training with Dean Lister tonight. Well, yeah, it depends on the context you're trying to add. If you're trying to

968
01:51:57.68 --> 01:52:04.08
add into the story, the fact that I know this guy that therefore makes me hit for cool like this guy,

969
01:52:04.08 --> 01:52:08.08
or on his level, whatever, or associated with him, so I'm cool, whatever that's the game dropping.

970
01:52:08.08 --> 01:52:11.68
But if you're just trying to paint a more accurate picture of your experience or your story,

971
01:52:11.68 --> 01:52:19.20
or the fact of the matter is, like I was training with Dean tonight, right? You know,

972
01:52:19.20 --> 01:52:24.40
yeah, see, so it added context to the story, but I said, Dean, and then you went, you

973
01:52:24.40 --> 01:52:30.48
can't reverse it. Or came back to say, do you lose, do you? That's neat. Nonetheless, the point is,

974
01:52:30.48 --> 01:52:36.56
if you start carrying on, you know, you don't know that you need suggestions, and you say,

975
01:52:36.56 --> 01:52:40.32
you know, whatever, I'm just going to move forward by thinking to smell that on you, that you're

976
01:52:40.32 --> 01:52:47.60
black like that. Yeah, I'm laughing some negative name dropping right now. It's true, that

977
01:52:47.60 --> 01:52:51.60
the point there is, you're a lot more transparent than you think, like a lot of people, and

978
01:52:51.60 --> 01:52:57.12
some people, you know, it's funny. You keep using transparent in its, in its, the way that the

979
01:52:57.12 --> 01:53:01.20
business community uses transparent right now, they use it in a positive way. Yeah, okay, look,

980
01:53:01.20 --> 01:53:04.72
we're just going to be completely transparent on how we're doing this. Yeah, you're using it

981
01:53:05.12 --> 01:53:11.20
in a, in a little bit of a negative way. Like, hey, I can see through your, your crap here. Yeah,

982
01:53:11.20 --> 01:53:15.60
yeah, and I tend to use it in both, like I use it in both. Yeah, I'm using both. But part of

983
01:53:15.60 --> 01:53:21.84
this thing kind of kind of thing, but I like that. I read that. I'm not sure if I'm signed

984
01:53:21.84 --> 01:53:26.80
for it, but nonetheless, yeah, they'll see right through that if you need suggestions, and that's

985
01:53:26.80 --> 01:53:31.52
on top to add to the fact that all this other stuff that it makes the team feel more valuable,

986
01:53:31.52 --> 01:53:36.56
it's a more, it's a better overall way to, to me. There's no doubt about it. No doubt,

987
01:53:36.56 --> 01:53:40.88
maybe by the way, in case you're wondering the best military planning units, whether it's the

988
01:53:40.88 --> 01:53:45.20
sealed teams or whether it's the army that I work with or whether it's some ring core, the more open they

989
01:53:45.20 --> 01:53:49.12
are in their planning, taking suggestions from, throughout the chain of command, of the better

990
01:53:49.12 --> 01:53:53.52
off they do period and the story. I should have just answered with that and we're going to move on.

991
01:53:53.52 --> 01:54:03.28
That's the way it works. Next question. This is a question slash clarification.

992
01:54:03.28 --> 01:54:10.72
Could you elaborate on flanking? My impression was that it meant to move around to attack from

993
01:54:10.72 --> 01:54:15.92
the side instead of head on, but as often as it comes up on your podcast, I get the impression

994
01:54:15.92 --> 01:54:24.72
there must be more to it, or at least some interesting nuances. I guess there's not that much more to

995
01:54:24.72 --> 01:54:29.60
it. I mean, a little piece of it was you want to distract them a little bit to the front,

996
01:54:29.60 --> 01:54:35.44
and then you want to flank them. That's about the only additional information that's needed to

997
01:54:35.44 --> 01:54:40.72
understand what flank is. Flank is yes, you attack you instead of attacking head on you attack

998
01:54:40.72 --> 01:54:47.76
from the side or sometimes the rear. I'll tell you just to point this out for anyone out there that's

999
01:54:47.76 --> 01:54:52.56
either in the military and law enforcement and you're going to flank and you're going to go

1000
01:54:52.88 --> 01:54:58.80
to the rear. Just remember that on a large scale at works because you have distance where your

1001
01:54:58.80 --> 01:55:07.52
weapon tree won't impact friendly lines, but if you surround someone or you come from the rear of

1002
01:55:07.52 --> 01:55:16.72
let's say a small target building or a situation with an open environment, but you're surrounding

1003
01:55:16.72 --> 01:55:22.32
an enemy. Just don't forget that when you surround an enemy, you now you're cutting off your own

1004
01:55:22.32 --> 01:55:27.04
field to fire. So that's why you shouldn't do that. You should just stick with the flank,

1005
01:55:27.04 --> 01:55:31.44
where that way you can still keep shooting and keep your field to fire as open as possible.

1006
01:55:31.44 --> 01:55:36.48
I just wanted to throw that in there, but that's what it is. Military terms it means you're attacking

1007
01:55:36.48 --> 01:55:42.96
the side, you're attacking the weak point, which is generally the sides. Now, it's the same thing,

1008
01:55:42.96 --> 01:55:47.84
obviously in GJitsu, you don't attack what they're defending. You attack their knack attack,

1009
01:55:47.84 --> 01:55:51.28
their knack attack, they forget about their knack and boom, you flank them and get their arm.

1010
01:55:51.28 --> 01:55:57.36
Greg Train said that to me tonight. He was like, oh, that was a little flanky. He says to me,

1011
01:55:58.16 --> 01:56:06.48
Greg Train. So did I just name drop? What if I said, Dean Lister said it that it would be a

1012
01:56:06.48 --> 01:56:11.76
name drop? If you said Greg Train told me that, well, today while I was hanging out with Dean

1013
01:56:11.76 --> 01:56:17.76
Dean Lister, that would have been a name. All right, I won't do that. So, but then you get,

1014
01:56:17.76 --> 01:56:22.80
so now you get flanky and we've talked about this before when you're talking about dealing with people.

1015
01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:29.84
Then yes, you don't want to attack where people are dug in. You don't want to attack what they are

1016
01:56:29.84 --> 01:56:36.24
defending. When someone has a strong point of view that they're married to, don't attack that.

1017
01:56:37.92 --> 01:56:42.56
It's someone has a big giant ego, don't attack that flanky.

1018
01:56:42.56 --> 01:56:52.08
It may, may be even just give a little bit of massage to that ego to distract them and then sneak

1019
01:56:52.08 --> 01:56:59.36
in from the flank with your idea and you put it in there. If someone's got a plan that they're

1020
01:56:59.36 --> 01:57:07.60
defending hard core, don't attack the plan. Come up with a little way to augment the plan, a little

1021
01:57:07.60 --> 01:57:11.76
twist on the plan that they already have. So you're accepting their plan, but you're putting your

1022
01:57:11.76 --> 01:57:22.08
spin on it. And that way, they accept it because it's part of what, it's part of their plan.

1023
01:57:22.08 --> 01:57:30.80
So it works. So once again, don't beat your head against the wall 487 times. Just flank.

1024
01:57:31.84 --> 01:57:39.36
Real simple. That's all it is. We have, and a lot of times it's a figurative thing.

1025
01:57:39.36 --> 01:57:45.04
Yes, well, obviously. And there's like all these little things he who flanks first wins

1026
01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:51.84
and flank or be flanked. There's one more. There's a million of them. But

1027
01:57:53.60 --> 01:57:59.84
when and out flank. Yeah, there's all these little things. But the great thing about it is also

1028
01:57:59.84 --> 01:58:05.52
just mentally. If we're trying to solve a problem and we're just thinking one way of the problem

1029
01:58:05.52 --> 01:58:10.48
when you get stuck in that white flank. When you come up to a, when you come up to an obstacle,

1030
01:58:10.48 --> 01:58:18.96
flank. When you get a resistance and you can't figure something out, flank. That's what I'm talking

1031
01:58:18.96 --> 01:58:26.24
about. Just always have that in your head. I'm always doing that emotionally dealing with relationships

1032
01:58:26.24 --> 01:58:35.20
scenarios. You got your relationship, your wife. She's dug in on something. Don't

1033
01:58:35.20 --> 01:58:41.68
us. That thing. Flank. Is that kind of like, um, you want to go to,

1034
01:58:42.72 --> 01:58:47.28
train you, Jitu, but you'd gone like a bunch of, no, no, you want to go to Taco Tuesday.

1035
01:58:47.28 --> 01:58:51.76
Or something. I don't know wherever you go. And you know, it's her birthday.

1036
01:58:51.76 --> 01:58:59.36
I go to a steak Saturday. Yeah, steak Saturday. So you buy your wife flowers the day or two days

1037
01:58:59.36 --> 01:59:04.72
before, right? Yeah. Instead of being like, I'm gonna, I'm the man. I'm going because I said,

1038
01:59:04.72 --> 01:59:10.16
so you buy either her the flowers. You flank them. And then when that day comes, you have the quote

1039
01:59:10.16 --> 01:59:15.68
unquote opportunity to see some friends just a quick one, one night. She'll remember those flowers

1040
01:59:15.68 --> 01:59:20.000
because she's on the, on the, on the, you know, the distractions. You distract her. You flank. You

1041
01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:25.04
flank. You're like, on Jurassic Park, you know, those, the raptors. You're, you're a

1042
01:59:25.04 --> 01:59:30.16
Jurassic Park. I have. It was quite some time ago. So, okay. So, it was about dinosaurs. Yeah. Yeah. So,

1043
01:59:30.16 --> 01:59:35.52
the T-Rex. The T-Rex can't really see that good. So, you just remain still. You keep,

1044
01:59:35.52 --> 01:59:39.36
you remain real still. He can't really see you because he sees movement. But the raptors,

1045
01:59:39.36 --> 01:59:43.76
they're, they're these like, they're a little meet, many T-Rexes. They flank though, don't they?

1046
01:59:43.76 --> 01:59:47.52
They flank. So, one of them is like messing with you, like engaging you and you think, okay,

1047
01:59:47.52 --> 01:59:52.24
I'm not going to move or maybe I'll move or whatever. And then the other T-Rex. Then they enjoy

1048
01:59:52.24 --> 02:00:00.56
you as their meal. That's a flank. It's a pre-holic. When in doubt, flank. Get that mindset.

1049
02:00:00.56 --> 02:00:03.44
It's a good mindset to have. I think you're right. The flank.

1050
02:00:07.04 --> 02:00:13.28
Next question. At what point do you turn off the manipulation tactics with people that you work with?

1051
02:00:13.28 --> 02:00:23.28
Or don't you. So, this question, I actually pulled this from a friend of mine. Not a good,

1052
02:00:23.28 --> 02:00:27.60
not someone I've known for a long time, but someone that's a guy that I know. He doesn't know

1053
02:00:27.60 --> 02:00:32.80
me well enough, but he knows well enough to ask me this question. Sure. Right? And he actually

1054
02:00:32.80 --> 02:00:35.84
sent me to text. He's like, you know, I've been thinking, after listening to your podcast,

1055
02:00:36.72 --> 02:00:42.96
are you just manipulating people all the time? Yeah. And it's a legit question, right? I have that

1056
02:00:42.96 --> 02:00:49.68
question. Yeah, even echo has that question. So, I obviously have talked about leadership and

1057
02:00:49.68 --> 02:00:56.64
influence as manipulation, because that's what they are. Right? If I'm trying to get you to do something,

1058
02:00:58.08 --> 02:01:02.08
you could say I'm leading you, but you could also say I'm manipulating you. Okay? And the difference

1059
02:01:02.08 --> 02:01:07.52
to me, and I can say I've pointed out this difference before, the difference to me is that if I'm trying

1060
02:01:07.52 --> 02:01:14.32
to do something that's going to benefit you or benefit the team, then that's leadership or that's

1061
02:01:14.32 --> 02:01:19.04
influence. If I'm trying to get you to do something and it's going to benefit me, then that's

1062
02:01:19.04 --> 02:01:29.52
manipulation. I've talked about that before. So, that being said, I am not running around in full

1063
02:01:29.52 --> 02:01:40.48
manipulation mode all the time. I'm not constantly sitting there trying to plot and make people do things.

1064
02:01:40.48 --> 02:01:49.28
I will say this though, I am generally conscious or aware or detached enough that I can see my

1065
02:01:49.28 --> 02:01:55.52
interactions with other people from a good enough distance to see how I'm affecting the situation.

1066
02:01:55.52 --> 02:02:03.44
So, it's there. You know, I'm aware of it. I do have a couple friends not many, where I'm

1067
02:02:03.44 --> 02:02:12.48
just completely unfiltered, some of the times, maybe even most of the time, but with most people,

1068
02:02:12.48 --> 02:02:17.28
like I said, I'm at least aware of what I'm saying and what I'm doing and how it's being received.

1069
02:02:19.60 --> 02:02:25.36
It's modulated though, and I'm not sitting there manipulating everyone that I

1070
02:02:25.36 --> 02:02:30.40
meet and the fact that matter is the reason it is, most of the time, I don't care. Not that

1071
02:02:30.40 --> 02:02:35.76
don't care about them, but I'm not, I'm not, I have no reason. I am not trying to do something with

1072
02:02:35.76 --> 02:02:40.32
this person. I'm just interacting with the person and I like to interact with different people,

1073
02:02:40.32 --> 02:02:47.20
and I have, I get along well with a lot of different types of people from straight-laced,

1074
02:02:47.20 --> 02:02:58.48
like religious people to freaking out wall bikers to surfers to alcoholics, to to fitness

1075
02:02:58.48 --> 02:03:03.76
freaks. I mean, I'm friends with a bunch of different people, and I'm definitely not sitting

1076
02:03:03.76 --> 02:03:10.08
around trying to manipulate them. I'm trying to enjoy, and I enjoy the various

1077
02:03:10.08 --> 02:03:17.76
personalities and sort of decisions and life that people had. I learned from them.

1078
02:03:17.76 --> 02:03:22.32
I'm not trying to manipulate, I'm actually trying to learn from people most of the time. Not manipulate.

1079
02:03:25.20 --> 02:03:31.60
But when I do get in a team setting or a business setting or a relationship setting,

1080
02:03:31.60 --> 02:03:46.16
we're now what we're doing is an interaction of humans, then I definitely will be thinking about

1081
02:03:46.16 --> 02:03:52.64
how my actions and reactions are affecting the situation. And I will tell you this,

1082
02:03:52.64 --> 02:04:02.56
I'm generally only doing it for good. I'm not trying to get things from people. I think you

1083
02:04:02.56 --> 02:04:10.000
would be one to say, like, I'm pretty generous with what I'm trying to do with my life and

1084
02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:17.84
and with helping people. Not that I find myself to be like some healer or some benevolent

1085
02:04:17.84 --> 02:04:21.52
person that's running around. I'm not trying to say that, but I'm generally what I'm

1086
02:04:21.52 --> 02:04:30.48
interacting with someone enough that I'm in this mode. I am trying to help. I'm trying to help us.

1087
02:04:31.36 --> 02:04:42.96
That's what I'm trying to do. So if this is manipulation to try and help people and try to help

1088
02:04:42.96 --> 02:04:47.36
whatever it is I'm doing with other people to move in the right direction if that's manipulation.

1089
02:04:47.36 --> 02:04:53.12
I'm guilty. Yeah, and you see, you kind of mentioned that too, you're using the word manipulation.

1090
02:04:53.12 --> 02:04:59.12
I use it where most people don't like to say it. Most people say, you know what? I really like to

1091
02:04:59.12 --> 02:05:03.68
influence my friends and move them in the right direction. Well, what is that doing? That's

1092
02:05:03.68 --> 02:05:08.08
manipulating. Yeah, so if you look at the definition, it's to handle cunningly. That's when

1093
02:05:08.08 --> 02:05:13.44
manipulation is nice. Well, there's another dimension in that too. But I think that's a more general

1094
02:05:13.44 --> 02:05:19.52
broad. Yeah, but I think the generally accepted meaning of the word manipulate has a negative

1095
02:05:19.52 --> 02:05:25.76
connotation for sure. And it is rightfully so because it generally, when you say it,

1096
02:05:25.76 --> 02:05:30.24
you're talking about, oh, Jocco is really manipulating echo. So does that mean? Oh,

1097
02:05:30.24 --> 02:05:34.96
Jocco is trying to get stuff from echo. He's trying to, he's trying to do stuff for his own benefit.

1098
02:05:34.96 --> 02:05:38.48
Whereas if I were to say, you know, Jocco, he's been hanging out with echo a lot.

1099
02:05:38.48 --> 02:05:44.08
And he's really having a good influence on him. Well, guys, what? That's cool. Oh, everyone's happy.

1100
02:05:44.08 --> 02:05:49.52
Now, but what did I really do? I really manipulated you. Right. I really made you act a certain way.

1101
02:05:49.52 --> 02:05:56.48
I led you. I manipulated you. Yeah. So again, I mean, maybe I need to stop using the word manipulation.

1102
02:05:56.48 --> 02:05:59.60
But I always, well, the reason I like to use it because I know it. I know it makes people think.

1103
02:06:00.16 --> 02:06:03.60
I know it makes people see leadership for what it is with leadership. You're trying to get

1104
02:06:03.60 --> 02:06:09.28
other human beings to do what you want them to do. That's what you're trying to do. Now, in the

1105
02:06:09.28 --> 02:06:13.28
best form of leadership, you're trying to get them to want to do what you want them to do.

1106
02:06:14.24 --> 02:06:19.84
And even in better form of leadership, you're trying to get them to do what they want to do.

1107
02:06:19.84 --> 02:06:25.60
And it happens to be what you want them to be to do, to do, too. That's the goal.

1108
02:06:25.60 --> 02:06:33.20
Well, but all of those means I'm trying to get you to do something. Yeah.

1109
02:06:33.76 --> 02:06:37.12
And whether we want to call it leadership or we want to call it influence or we want to call it

1110
02:06:37.12 --> 02:06:43.84
inspiration or we want to call it manipulation, it's the same thing. The only difference being

1111
02:06:43.84 --> 02:06:50.48
in my mind when I manipulate something, I'm trying to help myself. And I don't do that.

1112
02:06:50.48 --> 02:06:55.20
Right. I'm not trying to help myself. Yeah, manipulate through other people.

1113
02:06:55.20 --> 02:07:01.60
Yeah, it sounds like that it's helping yourself at their expense. Exactly.

1114
02:07:01.60 --> 02:07:07.20
And the influence is even more broad. I think he being goes outside of many people just because

1115
02:07:07.20 --> 02:07:10.000
influence, you can passively influence someone. You can just hang around with someone.

1116
02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:13.20
But you come with us on women, they're people, too. Yeah.

1117
02:07:15.20 --> 02:07:19.44
Yes, you can. You can absolutely passively women, they're people. Like, and not know you're doing it.

1118
02:07:19.44 --> 02:07:25.44
Yeah, you can. Well, no, you can do it by not doing something. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's like

1119
02:07:25.44 --> 02:07:30.32
passive aggressive manipulation. Yes. But like, influences, let's say we're just cruising

1120
02:07:30.32 --> 02:07:34.08
and we're hanging out. You're not telling me or asking me or whatever to do something. You're just

1121
02:07:34.08 --> 02:07:38.08
being you and I'm like, fuck, Jack was so cool man. Let me, let me roll up myself like,

1122
02:07:38.08 --> 02:07:41.28
Jack would does, you know, that's in the comments. That's I wouldn't call that money.

1123
02:07:41.28 --> 02:07:45.12
But that wouldn't be manipulation. Yeah, but what if I intentionally was like, you know what,

1124
02:07:45.12 --> 02:07:49.68
I really need to get. I really need to get echo to do acts. Yeah. Yeah. And here's what I'm

1125
02:07:49.68 --> 02:07:54.72
going to do. I'm going to show them. I'm going to lead. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, and really,

1126
02:07:56.40 --> 02:08:03.12
isn't, so that being said, isn't. Being just, just being, being polite.

1127
02:08:03.92 --> 02:08:09.04
Isn't that a low form of minute? Absolutely. If I say, hey, would it be possible for you to,

1128
02:08:09.04 --> 02:08:12.48
you know, grab that chair for me? What do you mean, would it be possible? We know that's possible.

1129
02:08:12.48 --> 02:08:18.08
Yes. But we don't. We know it's possible. I know it possible. Meant. Why did you say, if possible?

1130
02:08:18.08 --> 02:08:24.000
Why did I say that? Because I want you to feel good about it. If it depends, if you want to feel good,

1131
02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:28.80
you want to feel, you know, it's like you don't want to be a feminist. Absolutely. It's interacting

1132
02:08:28.80 --> 02:08:33.44
with other people. Right. So you have to show some form of if we want to use the word

1133
02:08:33.44 --> 02:08:38.88
manipulation, which we do obviously, um, yeah, you're always doing. So in a way, it's pretty rare.

1134
02:08:38.88 --> 02:08:44.000
You're going to turn it up. Yeah. Really. Yeah. Really. And so I guess to answer the question once again,

1135
02:08:45.04 --> 02:08:49.92
do I ever turn it off? Not really. Am I walking around trying to manipulate people and get them

1136
02:08:49.92 --> 02:08:57.44
to fall under my spell of destruction? Hang on. No. I'm just a normal guy that's interacting with

1137
02:08:57.44 --> 02:09:04.24
people on a regular way. And when I'm dealing with people in an interactive situation,

1138
02:09:04.24 --> 02:09:10.08
I'm aware of the way I'm acting and how it affects the situation. That's it. And you're

1139
02:09:10.08 --> 02:09:15.20
having to be pretty affected. I'm in a positive way though. How you turn it up? Like if it's for the

1140
02:09:15.20 --> 02:09:23.04
goal of the collective. Right. Right. It's not a, not a, to my level. Yes. It is not. All right. So

1141
02:09:23.04 --> 02:09:30.48
really the answer to the question is not really. That's the question. I like the way you put that.

1142
02:09:30.48 --> 02:09:35.28
All right. We got one more. Yeah. It's the good time for one more.

1143
02:09:36.64 --> 02:09:42.56
Jockel. How do you stay motivated and how do you motivate people when they start to slack?

1144
02:09:46.64 --> 02:09:56.40
Now motivation is kind of a strange word because it doesn't really mean what we think it means.

1145
02:09:56.40 --> 02:10:05.04
We think it means that we're fired up to do something. We think that it means we're eager

1146
02:10:06.24 --> 02:10:15.92
and passionate to make something happen. And we think that somehow we should just be able to

1147
02:10:15.92 --> 02:10:30.08
turn on that eagerness and turn on that passion. But we can't. Because you just can't turn on passion.

1148
02:10:30.08 --> 02:10:41.44
You can't just turn on the desire to execute a task. It just doesn't work that way. And honestly,

1149
02:10:41.44 --> 02:10:50.40
that isn't even what motivate means. Motivate doesn't mean to yell and scream and encourage.

1150
02:10:54.40 --> 02:11:01.68
No, to motivate actually means to provide a motive. A reason why.

1151
02:11:01.68 --> 02:11:13.20
So to motivate someone is to explain to them why they're doing what they're doing. How it will help them.

1152
02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:19.44
Where it'll take them. Why they should continue to work and to struggle and to fight.

1153
02:11:23.44 --> 02:11:29.68
And when you need motivation yourself, look for someone to scream and yell.

1154
02:11:29.68 --> 02:11:37.36
No, look for someone else to give you motivation. Look at yourself.

1155
02:11:40.80 --> 02:11:53.76
Look at yourself and remind yourself why. Why you are doing what you are doing. Remind yourself

1156
02:11:53.76 --> 02:12:05.60
that this struggle, this temporary pain, this fight that you're in, this is what will make you stronger

1157
02:12:05.60 --> 02:12:22.48
and faster and smarter and better. And then with that motivation go forward

1158
02:12:22.48 --> 02:12:32.88
into the frail, into the storm, into the heat of the battle.

1159
02:12:36.16 --> 02:12:40.16
Where victory is forged.

1160
02:12:40.16 --> 02:12:57.76
And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So thanks to everyone for listening and supporting.

1168
02:13:55.28 --> 02:14:02.32
Shroom tech? Yes. I think it was. I think I already said this. He was texting me and I want that

1169
02:14:02.32 --> 02:14:07.60
Shroom tech. Oh, back. He said he's didn't. Okay, nuts. Get the Shroom tech on.

1170
02:14:07.60 --> 02:14:13.28
I intend to do stuff for a long period of time. Anyway, on it is the supplement company.

1174
02:14:37.28 --> 02:14:43.92
Let's be in a joclist door. Before you shop on Amazon, if you go to joclistdoor, you can shop on

1175
02:14:43.92 --> 02:14:49.92
joclistdoor. If you like the shirt, we have shirts. We have a new one out too. But yeah, if you think

1176
02:14:49.92 --> 02:14:54.88
those are cool shirts, the new one out's know the darkness. See, no one's even going to know what

1177
02:14:54.88 --> 02:14:59.76
these things mean. Unless you're one of us, right? You're not going to know people is going to be

1178
02:14:59.76 --> 02:15:03.92
asking me what are you doing? Why you wearing that? I can barely read it. You said they weren't about it.

1179
02:15:03.92 --> 02:15:08.56
Yeah, and I'll say this where I don't know if I told you this before, but

1180
02:15:08.56 --> 02:15:16.40
the ideas behind the shirts, they're not just random. That looks cool on a shirt or whatever,

1181
02:15:16.40 --> 02:15:22.08
they do have inside meaning, discipline equals freedom. That was your thing originally before you

1182
02:15:22.08 --> 02:15:27.04
started podcast. When you said that, I was like, that doesn't make any sense. And that's what you said.

1183
02:15:27.04 --> 02:15:30.64
You said at first, it doesn't make any sense. And I was like, yeah, it doesn't make thinking in my head.

1184
02:15:30.64 --> 02:15:36.72
But then when you explain, it was like, dang, that's kind of, that's deep. It does make sense.

1185
02:15:36.72 --> 02:15:41.28
Yeah, it does make sense. It makes perfect sense. Actually, but it is one of those things. You know,

1186
02:15:41.28 --> 02:15:45.36
that's kind of where's so, okay. So that makes sense. If you don't know what it means, all it is is

1187
02:15:45.36 --> 02:15:49.28
yet another shirt with a little saying on it, that's all it is. If you don't know what it means,

1188
02:15:49.84 --> 02:15:57.28
same thing with your head that says good and good is backwards. All these shirts are for you. They're

1189
02:15:57.28 --> 02:16:02.64
not for like, hey, everyone look at my cool shirt even though they can have that effect. But that's not

1190
02:16:02.64 --> 02:16:07.92
what even their thing for you, cool. Yeah. So when you're looking in the mirror, it says good,

1191
02:16:07.92 --> 02:16:13.20
then you can see you can read it. It's backwards. So the darkness shirt, if you look at it's black on

1192
02:16:13.20 --> 02:16:18.56
a black shirt, barely see it. But that's what darkness is, man. You can barely see it, but you know

1193
02:16:18.56 --> 02:16:23.04
that that darkness. Look at the design on the mouth. Yeah, if you look at the design on the back,

1194
02:16:23.04 --> 02:16:27.68
it's a, we'll just say it's a dark scene. I'm just going to say that, but it's black on black. So you

1195
02:16:27.68 --> 02:16:32.48
can, unless you kind of know and you really look at it, you know, if the shirt means something

1196
02:16:32.48 --> 02:16:37.12
to you, you know, when it's going to be. So you're making shirts that actually, you got to be one of us.

1197
02:16:37.12 --> 02:16:43.04
Yeah, you got to be on the inside, you know, you have that extra layer. What's up? But him and if you

1198
02:16:43.04 --> 02:16:49.84
just think it just looks cool. Hey, do you know what? There you go. That's where to if you want.

1199
02:16:49.84 --> 02:16:57.92
Awesome. So that's everyone that makes the podcast happen and the actual people that make the podcast
