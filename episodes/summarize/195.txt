And so we do need to make sure that, you know, a lot of people are going to, I know that a lot of the people that listen to this podcast, I'm not going to directly represent them in Virginia 10, which is, you know, Northern Virginia. And you know, I kind of have an advantage where people have kind of heard of me, you know, people aren't coming up to me every day and you know, asking who I am or anything. Like, maybe I could have been in one of those rooms and ran out the guy and, I don't know, given, people some time, you know, like a lot of people did. Yeah, you know, it was just, uh, yeah, popped into my head like a lot of these other crazy ideas that I have, you know, you just out one time and, you know, a lot of it has to do with, I thought of the idea initially when I was training for the month of marathon's. I think it's just getting a feel, it's getting to know somebody, getting a, it's like, you know, hiring somebody for a job, you get to know who they are and they just decide if they want to work with you or not. and I was like, well, you know, you have a great story and it's the same thing I feel like saying to you, like, man, you, you've got a good story, right? Because these people kind of know, you know, they know the people on a granular level because they're local representatives. And that's that thing that you say, too, right, where you're like, hey, put them in the right, if they're like in a leadership situation at work or whatever, right, like you're like, hey, if they're overconfident, give them something just beyond their level. And the only way we're going to get leaders there is if leaders step up and they put themselves into that arena, take the risk of, you know, being under fire from these people, you know, kind of harkens back to, I think I talked about this last time. Yeah, and the reason that a lot of the times people get elected that have these kind of extreme views is because it gets coverage, it gets their name out there, people find out who they are and what they're saying kind of scares the person and the person is kind of reacting and, you know, from that fear. He brought me into his office and kind of gave me a rundown of, you know, what it takes and what you got to do and he set me up with his consultants and they talked to me a little bit and like, you know what, maybe I, I think I can't do this. So, you know, kind of always trying to think ahead of, you know, what's the next thing going to be, what's the next thing going to be? And then you just kind of slow the call through your friends and family, like every phone, every phone number you have in your phone, you know, like, so I started with kind of people that I talked to regularly. And when she definitely was like, you know, how you know, sometimes things are unfolding and you can tell people they're just doing their best just to like detach from it. They think they can, you know, get a paycheck that they can try and help you, but in a lot of the cases in the case here is I think they look at, you know, whether or not you have a good story, whether or not you, they think you can get elected and they kind of believe in you as well. So I, you know, I walked over to campus to see if I, without any kind of protection or anything to see if I could find this guy or whatever, walked around a little bit, but you know, I didn't see anybody because, you know, it was all happening in the building and it was all over by the time, I even left my apartment. You know, and that's the other weird thing about politics is you know, I used to think of the officers that were in the military and most of the time, much of the time, the officers that you wanted to work for were the kind of officers that didn't really care as not the right word, but I'm not sure how to explain it. If they had to double check my work all the time, you know, that's kind of the the whole purpose of a representative, you know, governmental system is that we're trusting, we're depending upon this one person to represent our, you know, our issues and what we need. We have evidence, we have theories, but we don't know what's going to happen when we pass, you know, some legislation, and you can see that over the course of the entirety of our country's history, we pass the level, like, oh, this is, this is what it's going to do. And another reason that's kind of hard right now is because we have, you know, there's going to be a primary and a lot of people don't want to support in a primary because these people have money. This podcast, okay, you're on here, you get to tell, you get to talk about people know your story, they hear it on a broad basis, you know, you got your own social media that you can talk directly to people and there's no filter, doesn't cost any money to put up a social media post. It interested in what Rob Jones looks like if you don't know already, which I think is going to be sorely disappointed if you want to know. That you know, you got blown up and lost both your legs and both your arms and even same thing with you, like, hey, and you're saying it, too, you're like, hey, I've got a good story. Like, you know, you said earlier, you make laws, but you don't actually know what they're going to do when they hit the books and when they start getting an act in the world. And then, you know, human beings, these big old brains that we can adapt to when people figure out, you know, ways to maneuver and, you know, this is what you get. And you think, well, and I said, halfway through this conversation with Travis, I'm like, hey, bro, I just want to let you know, like, I get that it's not exactly your great story. Yeah, so I think I decided, you know, I committed to it and we started setting things in motion, you know, probably in April or something like that earlier in the year. So, you know, if everybody that listens to this podcast, if you, I know a lot of people write in questions, saying when is John, why don't you go and life, going to start running for office? It's like a crazy battleground where people on the friend you, if you make a statement or you like someone's political post that they don't agree with, it's like crazy people. But I do think that I can start taking it back in that, that other direction, you know, get what they and cringe, I'll get with Brian Mass and form these, you know, these coalitions that we can start having a positive effect on, on the way things are going in Congress. And honestly, when we first started trying to, when we were first talking about how we would get money to buy what we're doing, to support what we're doing, I said, you know, well, maybe we just make some t-shirts, you know, and you're like, You kind of were in a difficult period, you know, in our country and we have what we were talking about with the poison is slowly making its way into the government and feeding out into the society and it's kind of breaking apart, you know, the glue that holds us together. And then he's right, you know, Jim, so good to talk with another person that, you know, grew up in the fine state of Maryland and I appreciate the support that you all gave us when I was up there going to Naval Academy. I got to admit, you know, but was it like the kind of surprise throw you in or it's like, hey, don't worry. And so I think, you know, that I have a little bit of an advantage here where I can be kind of with this attitude and I can still get coverage because, you know, I am a wounded veteran and I've done so much service and I've done all these things that I've done. You know, I don't want to, that's, but also, you know, it's just like being self-sufficient, right? But in when you look at a big picture, like that's a specific scenario where you knew her like capability and limitations or whatever because sometimes like you get someone maybe not comfortable in the water or something like this. It definitely, you know, it would be it'd be a bonus to have the 8,000, you know, Instagram followers that I have all getting my, you know, political stuff. Even if it is, you know, what I said before where you don't know, I know for sure. yeah, you have your, you know, kind of so-called default aggressive type of opinion or position on that default, you know, good guy or whatever, maybe. You seem saying and it's kind of obvious like being like afraid of something then you say then somebody will be like, hey, what are you really afraid of the thing about what I'm really afraid of just feels scary. And I said this, I said this on a podcast and every someone's like, well, there's all these extremists out there and I was like, you know what, I travel the country all the time. So kind of your first quarter that you raise is kind of a bit of an indicator, like if you raise enough money in the first quarter, that's a lot of people kind of use that as a gauge on how much of a chance you have. So you know, I'm sure there's, you know, you have to file as a candidate and all this stuff, you know, at the convention. And when we got the first reports, it was kind of like, they were just saying that somebody was roaming around campus, you know, shooting people. and they had experience, you know, they worked on previous campaigns, they had a lot of experience, they got him elected, but I think the vast majority of the time you, you know, you approach a consultant, it's a position, you do campaign consulting, that's your business. I don't know if it actually happened, but I know because this sounds like there could be some urban legend to this whole thing.
