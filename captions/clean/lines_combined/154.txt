00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.56 This is Jockel Podcast number 154.
00:00:03.56 --> 00:00:06.24 With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:06.24 --> 00:00:07.24 Good evening, I go.
00:00:07.24 --> 00:00:08.24 Good evening.
00:00:08.24 --> 00:00:11.52 And we are going to go into some Q&A today.
00:00:11.52 --> 00:00:12.52 Sure.
00:00:12.52 --> 00:00:15.32 We got a bunch of questions to go through.
00:00:15.32 --> 00:00:18.40 I asked if anyone on Twitter had questions.
00:00:18.40 --> 00:00:19.44 And I got a ton of them.
00:00:19.44 --> 00:00:21.92 So we're going to try and answer some of them.
00:00:21.92 --> 00:00:25.16 Some people, if you're listening and you ask the question,
00:00:25.16 --> 00:00:27.76 like, what time do I go to bed?
00:00:27.76 --> 00:00:30.96 Or what kind of workout do I do?
00:00:30.96 --> 00:00:33.68 Or something like that.
00:00:33.68 --> 00:00:37.92 Then I'm not going to answer it now because I've answered it a bunch of other times.
00:00:37.92 --> 00:00:39.56 There's a lot of fundamental things.
00:00:39.56 --> 00:00:42.56 Or it's in the discipline you go to freedom field manual.
00:00:42.56 --> 00:00:44.08 Or you know.
00:00:44.08 --> 00:00:47.64 So these were some questions that had some of them.
00:00:47.64 --> 00:00:49.28 Yeah, that we've heard some of them before.
00:00:49.28 --> 00:00:50.40 Maybe there's a different spin.
00:00:50.40 --> 00:00:55.60 But some of them I tried to pull back or pull out the fresher type
00:00:55.60 --> 00:00:58.56 of questions for this.
00:00:58.56 --> 00:01:04.08 And ones that aren't entirely fresh, I'll try and cover very briefly with whatever
00:01:04.08 --> 00:01:07.04 the new sort of anglers.
00:01:07.04 --> 00:01:13.36 Because there is a fact that you go to a class and you learn two or three new moves
00:01:13.36 --> 00:01:14.60 in Jiu Jitsu.
00:01:14.60 --> 00:01:15.60 And that's good.
00:01:15.60 --> 00:01:19.68 But you also review just a arm lock.
00:01:19.68 --> 00:01:24.20 And that is still beneficial, especially if it's from a new angle or a new instructor.
00:01:24.20 --> 00:01:27.28 They tell you, hey, you know, you move your hand a little bit further out on their
00:01:27.28 --> 00:01:30.52 rest if you're going for that thing and it helps you.
00:01:30.52 --> 00:01:31.52 Sure.
00:01:31.52 --> 00:01:33.52 So there's little details.
00:01:33.52 --> 00:01:34.52 Cool.
00:01:34.52 --> 00:01:35.52 So let's rock an old movie.
00:01:35.52 --> 00:01:36.52 Cool.
00:01:36.52 --> 00:01:40.72 First question, can you describe how difficult or no factor?
00:01:40.72 --> 00:01:42.96 Leaving your family was before deployment.
00:01:42.96 --> 00:01:43.96 I hate leaving.
00:01:43.96 --> 00:01:44.96 Okay.
00:01:44.96 --> 00:01:45.96 Let me just answer that one.
00:01:45.96 --> 00:01:46.96 Yeah.
00:01:46.96 --> 00:01:48.76 It sucks leave your family before deployment.
00:01:48.76 --> 00:01:50.000 That's the way it is.
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.16 One thing that I've always said is, you know, to guys that we're saying
00:01:54.16 --> 00:01:58.20 no, I gotta, I'm gonna leave my kids and it's horrible to leave.
00:01:58.20 --> 00:01:59.64 And I'm like, yep, it is.
00:01:59.64 --> 00:02:02.48 And they worry about it from the kids perspective.
00:02:02.48 --> 00:02:04.88 I'm not gonna be around, you know.
00:02:04.88 --> 00:02:07.28 Well, here's the deal.
00:02:07.28 --> 00:02:13.28 Men have been leaving to go and fight wars and do what they got to do for thousands of
00:02:13.28 --> 00:02:14.52 years.
00:02:14.52 --> 00:02:17.28 And so your kids are gonna be okay.
00:02:17.28 --> 00:02:24.12 And what good is they will see what you're doing, see your service and your sacrifice
00:02:24.12 --> 00:02:28.88 and you stepping up and holding the line for the nation.
00:02:28.88 --> 00:02:35.24 And that will be a lesson that they will learn by observation.
00:02:35.24 --> 00:02:36.92 And so even they'll be sad.
00:02:36.92 --> 00:02:38.24 But inside they're learning.
00:02:38.24 --> 00:02:41.28 They're learning that there's things more important than yourself.
00:02:41.28 --> 00:02:43.28 And so it's a good lesson to be taught.
00:02:43.28 --> 00:02:45.32 Yes, is it, is it horrible leave your family?
00:02:45.32 --> 00:02:46.32 It sure is.
00:02:46.32 --> 00:02:50.44 But it is a lesson for your kids.
00:02:50.44 --> 00:02:54.000 And it is a sacrifice you're making for your country.
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.84 And there are benefits to it.
00:02:58.84 --> 00:03:01.32 Your kids, you get to come home.
00:03:01.32 --> 00:03:05.96 And you'll see it and you'll see your kids, you know, be all excited.
00:03:05.96 --> 00:03:06.96 It's good.
00:03:06.96 --> 00:03:07.96 It's a good thing.
00:03:07.96 --> 00:03:08.96 So that's question one.
00:03:08.96 --> 00:03:09.96 Yes.
00:03:09.96 --> 00:03:12.12 It's harsh, but it's a worthy cause.
00:03:12.12 --> 00:03:18.72 Kind of second part to the question.
00:03:18.72 --> 00:03:21.88 Did you cry when you learned that your childhood friend committed suicide?
00:03:21.88 --> 00:03:24.20 Well, you were doing but.
00:03:24.20 --> 00:03:25.20 Okay.
00:03:25.20 --> 00:03:26.20 Yeah.
00:03:26.20 --> 00:03:31.12 So I mentioned that on a couple podcasts ago that my friend Jeff killed himself while
00:03:31.12 --> 00:03:31.96 I was going through ballets.
00:03:31.96 --> 00:03:32.88 He was a kid I'd grown up with.
00:03:32.88 --> 00:03:37.28 But I had I'd grown apart from him in the later grades, six, seven,
00:03:37.28 --> 00:03:38.68 eighth grade and through high school.
00:03:38.68 --> 00:03:40.52 We kind of grew apart.
00:03:40.52 --> 00:03:45.20 So I did not, you know, I was I was sad by the situation.
00:03:45.20 --> 00:03:51.08 But I didn't it wasn't super emotional about it because I we had kind of
00:03:51.08 --> 00:03:54.36 grown apart and it had been, you know, I was and was now in the Navy.
00:03:54.36 --> 00:03:59.72 So no, didn't cry, but was definitely sad about the situation.
00:03:59.72 --> 00:04:05.80 Is it I mean kind of back to that first part, but lean.
00:04:05.80 --> 00:04:09.88 Isn't like that like a healthy dose of that like good for the kids for sure?
00:04:09.88 --> 00:04:14.04 Because it's like now they know how to make do, you know, like if dad's there for
00:04:14.04 --> 00:04:16.52 every little thing kind of thing for sure.
00:04:16.52 --> 00:04:20.60 And then, you know, the in that middle day comes that you're going to go, you know,
00:04:20.60 --> 00:04:23.96 leave or the air at least they got to leave, you know, you don't have to depend on kind of
00:04:23.96 --> 00:04:25.96 dad being there kind of for you.
00:04:25.96 --> 00:04:31.64 The trials and tribulations and and those things adversity will make kids tougher.
00:04:31.64 --> 00:04:33.64 That's just the bottom line.
00:04:33.64 --> 00:04:39.08 So this is a adversity and it's an adversity that kids, you know, they they it'll
00:04:39.08 --> 00:04:39.80 make them tougher.
00:04:39.80 --> 00:04:40.76 Make them stronger.
00:04:40.76 --> 00:04:41.96 Yes, agree.
00:04:41.96 --> 00:04:46.28 Next wish any good recommendations for cutting back on alcohol.
00:04:46.28 --> 00:04:55.32 You know, just straight up why would you cut back and not just stop at this point in my life?
00:04:55.32 --> 00:04:57.72 I don't I don't drink anymore.
00:04:57.72 --> 00:05:03.000 And I know that some people have an alcohol problem.
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000 And so I think trying to cut back if you have an alcohol problem is in a realistic thing to do
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000 because you'll take that slippery slope and and just get drunk.
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.36 Yeah. So I think what you have to do is just stop and I know that and again, I I'm not I don't
00:05:20.36 --> 00:05:25.56 I don't have a good familiarization to know what it's like to be addicted to alcohol.
00:05:26.68 --> 00:05:29.80 I didn't even I didn't even really like consciously.
00:05:29.80 --> 00:05:32.20 Oh, I'm going to stop drinking now.
00:05:32.20 --> 00:05:35.08 I just stopped drinking because I was out of the navy.
00:05:35.08 --> 00:05:40.68 I was working a bunch and carrying on and wasn't around those, you know, my bros anymore.
00:05:40.68 --> 00:05:42.12 Where we'd go out and have a beer.
00:05:42.12 --> 00:05:45.88 And so if that's not happening, then it's not happening.
00:05:45.88 --> 00:05:52.12 And that's one thing I'll all say is I know that people that have alcohol issues addictions.
00:05:52.12 --> 00:05:56.60 They always say you've got to change the people places and things that you do.
00:05:56.60 --> 00:05:59.48 So the people that you hang around with that like to drink, you can't hang around with them.
00:05:59.48 --> 00:06:02.36 The place that you go with everyone likes to drink, you can't go to those places.
00:06:02.36 --> 00:06:05.72 The things that you like to do that involve drinking, you can't do those things.
00:06:05.72 --> 00:06:07.32 So there you go.
00:06:07.32 --> 00:06:12.92 I would say stop drinking and hey, if you're an alcoholic, you got to get medical supervision
00:06:12.92 --> 00:06:16.12 because that's actually you can die if you're an alcoholic and you stop drinking.
00:06:16.12 --> 00:06:19.48 So you have to you have to like go and get help.
00:06:20.52 --> 00:06:21.56 But stop.
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.12 Yeah, a lot of those times those the people who are that far into alcoholism where they stop drinking
00:06:28.12 --> 00:06:29.64 and they die.
00:06:30.84 --> 00:06:33.40 That's like usually they don't even want to stop drinking.
00:06:33.40 --> 00:06:36.36 Usually that's just how I'm drinking usually.
00:06:36.36 --> 00:06:40.68 But I think I might have more experience on this one.
00:06:40.68 --> 00:06:41.40 10 year.
00:06:41.40 --> 00:06:49.56 But all those things I meant that's like a really concise and it's a good way to put it like the people
00:06:49.56 --> 00:06:51.16 placing things, right?
00:06:51.16 --> 00:06:52.04 Actives you would ever.
00:06:53.24 --> 00:06:57.64 But a big part of it and I said this before where a big part where I would stop drinking
00:06:57.64 --> 00:07:00.84 it was way easier when I just understood what it was.
00:07:00.84 --> 00:07:04.68 You know, like understood like why am I just wanting to drink?
00:07:04.68 --> 00:07:08.76 And why is it that when I start drinking like it's kind of harder to stop?
00:07:09.32 --> 00:07:11.48 You know, then maybe I don't know the next guy or whatever.
00:07:11.48 --> 00:07:16.36 And then when I once understood like what's happening physiologically or whatever,
00:07:16.36 --> 00:07:21.72 I came up with my own little strategy and the big part of it was like oh yeah, like my brain
00:07:21.72 --> 00:07:26.76 is like tricking me into thinking like yeah that you want this this thing or whatever.
00:07:26.76 --> 00:07:31.48 That was like a major one and the other one was kind of has to do with the people placing things.
00:07:31.48 --> 00:07:37.80 It was where if I had a reason not to drink like if I had a workout that I really took seriously
00:07:37.80 --> 00:07:42.92 the next day or if I was going to record or something, do to do something where to be hungover
00:07:42.92 --> 00:07:45.08 whatever would really mess me up.
00:07:46.28 --> 00:07:47.48 It'd be way easier.
00:07:47.48 --> 00:07:52.44 You know, so back like you know in high school but in college like kin athletics and stuff like that.
00:07:53.32 --> 00:07:55.96 You never really drink during the week because you had practice the next day.
00:07:55.96 --> 00:07:58.20 You don't want to be hungover in practice, you know, so it'd be really easy.
00:07:58.20 --> 00:07:59.72 Yeah, I'm going to drink in today kind of thing.
00:07:59.72 --> 00:08:05.56 So if you can kind of set up your life where you have like something important that you can kind of look
00:08:05.56 --> 00:08:11.32 forward to and really care about the outcome of something that's not necessarily mundane in your
00:08:11.32 --> 00:08:15.32 in your mind because a lot of times that all kind of it's a slippery slope when you're like yeah it's
00:08:15.32 --> 00:08:20.28 important but it's mundane in your life you'll be like let's see how I can endure it kind of hungover.
00:08:20.28 --> 00:08:21.000 It's kind of worth it.
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.68 I'll pay the price now you know what kind of thing.
00:08:23.48 --> 00:08:28.52 But yeah if you can set up your life where you have something that you find like important
00:08:28.52 --> 00:08:31.80 to be functioning fully that helps.
00:08:31.80 --> 00:08:32.76 Yeah, due to.
00:08:33.48 --> 00:08:34.92 Train, due to one Saturdays.
00:08:35.24 --> 00:08:40.28 Yeah, it affected me when I was in the teams and we got drinking on Friday and then when I started
00:08:40.28 --> 00:08:44.52 training due to all the time I didn't want to I wanted to be good to go for due to so yeah I just like
00:08:45.16 --> 00:08:47.80 started started to stop drinking on Friday and I'd hard.
00:08:47.80 --> 00:08:52.60 I would say this with due to, I would say compete in due to then because
00:08:52.60 --> 00:08:56.04 but and I don't know people are different you know there's a spectrum but
00:08:56.04 --> 00:09:01.72 to me you just I mean all train hungover, due to in fact due to help say hangover.
00:09:02.76 --> 00:09:07.72 If you can drag yourself out of the house yeah which is actually isn't that hard once you do it once.
00:09:07.72 --> 00:09:11.56 If you go if you're hungover and you're like oh man I really don't feel like I'm in a due to right now
00:09:11.56 --> 00:09:15.40 but you just do it the first time you do it that's the hardest time every other time you're like yeah
00:09:15.40 --> 00:09:20.12 I did it for this easy I'm not gonna be suffering you go you know depending on the level of
00:09:20.12 --> 00:09:23.64 hangover you're gonna suffer in due to or maybe not after what you used to it.
00:09:23.64 --> 00:09:28.28 I don't know maybe it's what it out. I was training like at a higher level and I mean like
00:09:28.28 --> 00:09:32.60 seriously not trying to be like a jerk but like I would this is back when I was training training
00:09:32.60 --> 00:09:37.96 with Fabio and so Dean and I would choke when we trained for like three hours straight and like
00:09:37.96 --> 00:09:42.84 hard and so if you're gonna come in and do four rounds yeah you're a little hungover it's no
00:09:42.84 --> 00:09:46.36 big deal but if you're gonna come in and you're gonna train for you know an hour worth the
00:09:46.36 --> 00:09:51.96 class then you're gonna roll hard core for for two hours you're not gonna trust me you're not
00:09:51.96 --> 00:09:58.04 gonna want to be all hungover dehydrated and jacked up mentally. Yeah I dig it and if you're
00:09:58.04 --> 00:10:03.32 gonna train fat hard then yeah don't you probably it's gonna be hard to drink and I mean that's
00:10:03.32 --> 00:10:07.56 that's your typical person not gonna train that hard I mean yeah if you're drinking too much
00:10:07.56 --> 00:10:12.36 if you're a competitive no even people who don't drink don't train that hard typically in my
00:10:12.36 --> 00:10:17.56 experience I don't know but if you're training for a tournament it's gonna you can take it way
00:10:17.56 --> 00:10:21.72 more seriously just kind of in the back of your mind you know it's not just like oh you're just the training
00:10:21.72 --> 00:10:26.68 so again I'm not saying so that's not gonna work if you're just practicing so it won't work
00:10:26.68 --> 00:10:31.72 I'm not saying that I'm saying people are different and if I use myself as an example like I
00:10:31.72 --> 00:10:37.16 could I could train I could hang I was I was training with like when I when I'd go
00:10:37.16 --> 00:10:41.80 training like at auto so whatever with these crazy training sessions yeah I would go slightly hungover
00:10:41.80 --> 00:10:48.68 go dean every Friday so okay look of course I could probably train better if I didn't
00:10:49.40 --> 00:10:55.24 drink the night before for sure but I'm just saying as a as a catalyst for stopping drinking
00:10:55.24 --> 00:10:59.80 that didn't help you it didn't help me as much as it made yeah it didn't even it wasn't even like a
00:10:59.80 --> 00:11:06.04 catalyst to help me stop drinking it was just the functionality of life yes was oh I've got to do
00:11:06.04 --> 00:11:12.52 this in the morning cool I'm not gonna get all hammered tonight so I can do better yeah as a human
00:11:12.52 --> 00:11:17.24 yeah and that's really the format right there where you find so I mean to me you know like you're
00:11:17.24 --> 00:11:23.16 not like jiu-jitsu just the training if I wasn't if I was competing or I'd easily stop drinking
00:11:23.16 --> 00:11:29.32 easily but just for the training if I didn't have a competition or whatever it wasn't it didn't help
00:11:29.32 --> 00:11:35.64 as much as one might think but if I had something like you know if we're recording or something
00:11:35.64 --> 00:11:40.36 something who that you would think you might be able to even it just depends on how important it is
00:11:40.36 --> 00:11:44.52 for you to be functioning at the best level you can you know if I get tapped out a few more
00:11:44.52 --> 00:11:48.12 times and you just it's kind of like whatever so it just depends on who you are as what I'm saying
00:11:50.12 --> 00:11:55.24 you're like that either way yeah I mean I think that helps but that's gonna be hard
00:11:56.84 --> 00:12:02.92 either way if you don't have some kind of like format scaffolding in your brain to kind of like a plan
00:12:02.92 --> 00:12:07.56 you know like a little strategy to be like yeah I'm just gonna drink less just kind of just
00:12:07.56 --> 00:12:13.32 gonna drink less yeah it's pretty rare that's gonna yeah yeah that's why cut back I don't I say
00:12:13.32 --> 00:12:24.28 don't cut back to stop you check next question communication is often used as an excuse both
00:12:24.28 --> 00:12:31.08 under and over oh under communication and over communication for why the direction isn't clear
00:12:31.08 --> 00:12:37.40 any suggestions on balancing comms communication up and down with the right level of detail
00:12:38.28 --> 00:12:43.88 here's a jacked up answer the answer to this question of how to balance comms is comms
00:12:43.88 --> 00:12:46.52 you own balance communication you have to communicate you have to understand hey do you
00:12:46.52 --> 00:12:49.72 guys know what's going on you need to check and make sure that they know what's going on
00:12:49.72 --> 00:12:54.60 if they know what's going on great if they don't know then you didn't communicate with them enough
00:12:54.60 --> 00:12:58.52 if you spent too much time communicating and now they're looking at you with a blank stare like
00:12:58.52 --> 00:13:03.72 hey bro we got this then you communicated too much so and ask them hey do you understand what's
00:13:03.72 --> 00:13:08.36 going on cool and if not do you understand why we're doing what we're doing cool all right good
00:13:08.36 --> 00:13:14.28 I'm gonna let you go do it now so the answer to making sure you're not communicating
00:13:14.84 --> 00:13:19.64 either too much or too little is communication I hate to say that but that's what it is
00:13:19.64 --> 00:13:24.44 there can be some of that can be non-verbal communication you know you can observe
00:13:24.44 --> 00:13:28.44 if you if you give your guys a task and then you go out and observe them and you see that they can
00:13:28.44 --> 00:13:32.68 execute it really well then you know that you've done a good job communicating that to them
00:13:32.68 --> 00:13:35.88 if you go out to observe them and they don't know what they're doing and they don't know what's going on
00:13:36.28 --> 00:13:39.96 and then you realize how I didn't give them enough information I need to communicate more
00:13:39.96 --> 00:13:45.32 so you don't have to necessarily ask them you can tell through observation and checking on them
00:13:45.32 --> 00:13:49.16 and seeing where they're at and what they're doing if they actually understand what's going on so
00:13:49.16 --> 00:13:53.16 yeah that's that's it pretty straightforward get your little feedback loop going
00:13:53.16 --> 00:13:59.40 yeah that but it is kind of like and I'm gonna use the word again dance it is kind of like
00:13:59.40 --> 00:14:04.60 a dance though it's an academy yes you can you can communicate too much and you can communicate
00:14:04.60 --> 00:14:08.44 too little and you have to find the balance thing because if you communicate too much people
00:14:08.44 --> 00:14:12.36 stop listening to it and then it's no longer communication at that point because it's kind of like
00:14:12.36 --> 00:14:16.76 if you're sleeping and I'm like hey okay Jocca told me what to do like you you can't hear me it's
00:14:16.76 --> 00:14:20.84 not going into your brain it kind of has to go in your brain what I'm saying you got to kind of
00:14:20.84 --> 00:14:25.32 your does you got to catch what I'm throwing yeah and you know and vice versa if we're
00:14:25.32 --> 00:14:29.48 quote unquote communicating so yeah over to quote quotes around the case it's just a word
00:14:29.48 --> 00:14:35.56 I'm just alright there you go but if one of those even one of those things isn't happening
00:14:35.56 --> 00:14:39.80 we're technically we're not communicating so like the whole over communication thing that's like
00:14:39.80 --> 00:14:44.68 yeah someone talking too much another guy stops listening are you over communicating so far in this
00:14:44.68 --> 00:14:52.36 spot it's not you know I'm just saying like how you say like feedback you know like that
00:14:52.36 --> 00:14:56.20 that's an important thing because if you're like blah blah blah blah and how you say the
00:14:56.20 --> 00:15:01.08 blank stare communications gone communications not going on you look on my face right now yeah
00:15:01.08 --> 00:15:05.16 like the one that's blanks you know you can't even see back which is good see I'm saying so
00:15:05.16 --> 00:15:09.48 now I'm clear I'm clear that you want me to move it along see I'm saying it's good communication
00:15:09.48 --> 00:15:14.60 on your part here's the thing with you and your blank stare in my experience which I have
00:15:14.60 --> 00:15:20.28 a lot by the way your blank stare communicates way more than just like a blank stare
00:15:21.88 --> 00:15:26.04 for real yeah Mike Sarelli would we'll tell you all about that like you'll you'll have a whole
00:15:26.04 --> 00:15:32.36 conversation with me and not even say one single word for real I know exactly what you're saying
00:15:32.36 --> 00:15:37.08 see like right now I know exactly what you're saying anyway next question that's exactly what I would
00:15:37.08 --> 00:15:42.84 say actually like I said when taking ownership how can you prevent your boss
00:15:42.84 --> 00:15:48.44 thinking you're a complete screw up and stop it from escalating to a point where there
00:15:48.44 --> 00:15:54.28 where he starts blaming you for things you're not actually at fault so this is one of those
00:15:54.28 --> 00:16:00.36 catch 22 situations where you actually don't think you're at fault so when you actually don't
00:16:00.36 --> 00:16:05.40 think you're at fault then you're thinking oh I'm just taking ownership so that that's like the
00:16:05.40 --> 00:16:10.04 cool thing to do that's what I'm trying to use this as to make to improve my situation right I'm
00:16:10.04 --> 00:16:16.12 gonna I'm gonna quote unquote take ownership and when you quote unquote take ownership but you
00:16:16.12 --> 00:16:20.60 actually don't believe you're at fault then you're not you're not really taking ownership so
00:16:21.40 --> 00:16:25.56 when you look around at your mission at your tacit what you're being told to do and you say oh
00:16:25.56 --> 00:16:31.32 I've got to do this thing oh it didn't go right and I'm gonna take ownership of it and get it fixed
00:16:31.32 --> 00:16:35.56 if you're just saying that and you don't actually mean it then your boss starts blaming you for it
00:16:35.56 --> 00:16:41.16 well you you you should feel that way because when your boss blames you for something you know
00:16:41.16 --> 00:16:46.68 you should be saying yeah boss I know I said that this was my responsibility and this is what
00:16:46.68 --> 00:16:51.08 I'm gonna do to fix it you shouldn't when your boss starts blaming for you for things you should say
00:16:51.48 --> 00:16:56.84 well no actually that's not my area of responsibilities what you should say is oh yes boss like I just
00:16:56.84 --> 00:17:02.52 said this is my fault and here's what I'm gonna do to fix it that's what you do so you actually
00:17:02.52 --> 00:17:08.60 think about this when you're when you're the type of person that takes ownership of things
00:17:09.80 --> 00:17:15.88 you actually can't get blamed for the things you can't blame me for things because I'm already
00:17:15.88 --> 00:17:20.52 volunteering and saying that this was my responsibility and I'm gonna fix it so
00:17:21.88 --> 00:17:25.96 that's what you do that's what you do you take ownership and you take real ownership which means
00:17:25.96 --> 00:17:29.48 when there's a problem you look at it and say this is hey this is my fault here's what I'm
00:17:29.48 --> 00:17:36.28 gonna do to fix it and when your boss says hey yeah yeah this is your fault you go I know boss
00:17:36.28 --> 00:17:41.56 I know 100% and this is what I'm gonna do to fix it and then you go fix it yeah and the thing that
00:17:41.56 --> 00:17:46.44 I didn't know is I said this before too but I think it's easy to sort it forget when especially
00:17:46.44 --> 00:17:52.12 if you're thinking like this which is which I dig man is the whole what am I gonna do to fix it
00:17:52.12 --> 00:17:58.84 because when you when you like for real take ownership whatever it's because man just like I
00:17:58.84 --> 00:18:04.52 said it's almost like what you just said where where you say you can't blame me you can't blame me
00:18:04.52 --> 00:18:09.96 because I already took responsibility kind of thing because and in a big way it's not necessarily
00:18:09.96 --> 00:18:15.16 about blame it's more about fixing problems that course on a come up nothing's perfect you know
00:18:15.16 --> 00:18:20.44 so now it's like it's more of like a way of dealing with problems less than a whole blaming take
00:18:20.44 --> 00:18:25.96 blame in culture in business in terms of really for blaming each other yeah that's what happens
00:18:25.96 --> 00:18:30.20 and if you're the person that says hey you know what this is actually my fault and this is what I'm
00:18:30.20 --> 00:18:36.12 gonna do to fix it there you go yeah then that blame you you could say yeah blame me I'm the guy
00:18:36.12 --> 00:18:41.24 because that's the guy that made this mistake yeah yeah and then you can just focus on fixing the
00:18:41.24 --> 00:18:45.64 problem and you're meant to that and that's the thing is the reason I bring it up is because it is
00:18:45.64 --> 00:18:50.12 easy to forget that part because that blame is still in the problem part yeah yeah yeah with extreme
00:18:50.12 --> 00:18:54.92 ownership I mean up here obviously because it's like hey I took in kickstream ownership like
00:18:54.92 --> 00:19:01.08 why yeah why didn't you do how are you saying it's my fault yeah yeah yeah that's not the main part
00:19:01.08 --> 00:19:07.32 of me and part is like you gotta fix it yeah you know yeah I think so all right next next question
00:19:08.68 --> 00:19:14.36 I have two warrior kid daughters who are very much on the path with pretty much everything but
00:19:14.36 --> 00:19:20.44 snacking they're they're starting to put some weight on as a result despite tons of physical activity
00:19:20.44 --> 00:19:26.36 and good eating at meal time how can I coach them in this area without being overbearing
00:19:27.16 --> 00:19:31.08 I would say don't have snack food in your house that's junk which you probably do
00:19:31.72 --> 00:19:36.84 don't and yeah that's that's real simple what are they gonna do if there's no snack food in
00:19:36.84 --> 00:19:42.28 house how are they gonna snack you know the answer is they're not because they can go out and eat grass
00:19:42.84 --> 00:19:48.76 from the yard if they're still hungry but so that's that's one thing the other thing is you got
00:19:48.76 --> 00:19:55.08 to be careful with with kids and I'll say this with girls especially you start throwing that like
00:19:55.08 --> 00:19:58.28 hey you need to watch your weight you can really mess with their body image so you got to be really
00:19:58.28 --> 00:20:03.24 careful about what you're doing with the kid with a with a little girl guess what little girls little
00:20:03.24 --> 00:20:08.36 boys guess what they are when they're when they're little the little pudgy little creatures you know
00:20:08.36 --> 00:20:15.32 and sure there'll be some genetic kids that are have 2% body fat and a 12 pack of abs when they're
00:20:15.32 --> 00:20:21.80 6 years old but most kids are like little little bit pudgy that's part of their prepping for
00:20:21.80 --> 00:20:27.40 their growths perk and if you're all freaked out about it you know just what you're gonna do
00:20:27.40 --> 00:20:30.44 is you're gonna put that in their head they're gonna start looking in the mirror and you don't want
00:20:30.44 --> 00:20:35.88 to do that to your kids so don't have any junk food snacks in the house give them some milk
00:20:35.88 --> 00:20:39.64 right give them some warrior kid milk because it tastes delicious it is like a snack and it's good
00:20:39.64 --> 00:20:43.64 for them and it'll be it'll be satiating I know you don't like that word echo but it'll
00:20:43.64 --> 00:20:49.000 satiate them and it'll make them feel full so that's that's a good kind of snack food to have in the
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.32 house and if you're gonna have other snack food then make it beef jerky make it some health these
00:20:53.32 --> 00:21:00.60 you know some carrots some some celery you know make it some good healthy stuff but um yeah like
00:21:01.80 --> 00:21:05.48 worrying about your kids starting to put on some weight when they're I don't know how old they are
00:21:05.48 --> 00:21:09.24 in this particular case but just be careful you don't want to you don't want to freak your kids out
00:21:09.24 --> 00:21:14.12 and get them with a with a really paranoid body image especially girls they're getting it from
00:21:14.12 --> 00:21:19.56 million different directions and you gotta be careful with it because that's a real that can
00:21:19.56 --> 00:21:26.68 be turned into a real problem and the thing that that actually you clarified really good to me one
00:21:26.68 --> 00:21:32.28 day where when you kind of implement change you know in a routine is especially if snacking is kind of
00:21:32.28 --> 00:21:35.72 like a routine you know whatever when you implement change like it's good there's gonna be some hiccups
00:21:35.72 --> 00:21:40.20 there you know like whether be I don't know in this case like complaining like hey well you know
00:21:40.20 --> 00:21:45.80 you're saying hey don't keep snacks in the house so now there's no chocolate cover pretzels anymore
00:21:45.80 --> 00:21:49.000 you know like hey I remember the chocolate cover pretzels they were right there in the little
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.44 pantry right there now they're gone like what up I haven't seen them in days yeah like hey
00:21:52.44 --> 00:21:56.60 we're not doing the chocolate cover pretzels anymore yeah or whatever there's gonna be some
00:21:56.60 --> 00:22:00.04 blowback there especially from the little kids you know they can be like well at that you know
00:22:00.04 --> 00:22:05.64 there might be some complaining so I think if we go in or when we go in knowing those
00:22:05.64 --> 00:22:10.60 things that helps a lot so you're kind of prepared for you know you can kind of plan what you
00:22:10.60 --> 00:22:14.52 can say are hanging hands in way to intense with this but there's no chocolate covered pretzels
00:22:14.52 --> 00:22:18.92 guess what they didn't have met the store I'm not getting them they're bad for us yeah I did it but
00:22:18.92 --> 00:22:25.32 a lot of times when you have you know two girls or whoever you get a lot of bar yeah but they're
00:22:25.32 --> 00:22:29.32 not getting your kids like pull up bar train yeah but they're not gonna be like hey oh well
00:22:29.32 --> 00:22:33.32 no chocolate pretzels oh I'll just do pull ups it doesn't work like that with the little kids
00:22:33.32 --> 00:22:36.92 you got it not that big of a deal to take to pull a snack out of your house yes I don't
00:22:36.92 --> 00:22:40.52 especially if you get some beef jerky and you're like oh you know what that's a bad for us and
00:22:40.52 --> 00:22:44.04 I don't want to eat anymore so I got beef jerky here it's really good taste it yes but to be
00:22:44.04 --> 00:22:47.96 great see weed deal the dried seaweed oh yeah like you used to eat that stuff like it was like they
00:22:47.96 --> 00:22:54.60 were damn octopuses but that's good there okay bye yeah yes I like the dry seaweed yeah
00:22:54.60 --> 00:22:57.96 it sounds pounding some of that the other day with both my kids they're like in salty
00:22:57.96 --> 00:23:03.000 delicious anyway what I'm saying is I'm not saying necessarily make it a huge deal I'm just saying
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.32 if you're ready for the blowback you know because what if you're not ready you think that okay
00:23:07.32 --> 00:23:11.24 I'll agree with you just to to we can move this conversation along in order to prep for
00:23:11.24 --> 00:23:15.72 you stop the chocolate covered pretzels and you don't really agree you can come up with a
00:23:16.36 --> 00:23:21.80 a plan of action little plan of action and immediate action drill when that six year old goes
00:23:21.80 --> 00:23:28.04 dad where are the chocolate covered pretzels you have a very well-rehearsed response you can
00:23:28.04 --> 00:23:35.40 do some roleplaying with your wife and you go yes see let's see what you're doing in the
00:23:35.40 --> 00:23:41.72 moment I'm telling you this helps this will help okay because you you know the the
00:23:41.72 --> 00:23:46.20 pork is you care you know you care about the short term a little bit too you know of course
00:23:46.20 --> 00:23:49.40 a long term you know that's what you're doing the whole thing but you gotta do is explain
00:23:49.40 --> 00:23:53.64 hey you know what hey we're not doing that anymore because it's not good for us okay straight up
00:23:53.64 --> 00:24:01.08 cool there it is that's not a huge well we're doing it anyway roleplay with your wife
00:24:01.08 --> 00:24:10.36 no next question why isn't MMA or did you to a bigger component of law enforcement training
00:24:10.36 --> 00:24:16.04 just seems to be a huge missed opportunity yeah it certainly is a huge missed opportunity I
00:24:16.04 --> 00:24:25.08 I plead with all law enforcement personnel to train Brazilian GJ2 MMA wrestling boxing
00:24:25.08 --> 00:24:32.20 Mojtai as much as you possibly can and I plead with law enforcement agencies of all types
00:24:32.20 --> 00:24:39.32 that I talk to to get these types of programs in your departments because there is no doubt
00:24:39.32 --> 00:24:46.60 that it will help you it help your officers be better and more prepared to handle situations on
00:24:46.60 --> 00:24:51.80 the street just had a police officer coming here the other day that was just signing up and you know
00:24:51.80 --> 00:24:58.52 she just got down to the police category and I'm so thankful that she's here because I'm like yes
00:24:58.52 --> 00:25:06.44 go and start training immediately and it will be so beneficial for you in your career in your life
00:25:06.44 --> 00:25:13.08 and one thing about all these things and any form of martial arts for like self defense or
00:25:13.08 --> 00:25:17.32 self defense situations or you know because that's sometimes when it turns into for a police officer
00:25:17.32 --> 00:25:22.84 they're no longer you know once you things things cross over from where they're on offense to
00:25:22.84 --> 00:25:27.40 where they're on defense and for a police officer this is a great example like this was a female
00:25:27.40 --> 00:25:39.80 and hey could a female 118 pound female police officer take a guy that was drunk slightly drunk
00:25:39.80 --> 00:25:48.84 a wrestler whose 240 pounds the answer is no she's not gonna farewell in that situation but
00:25:49.88 --> 00:25:56.52 if she knows if whatever she knows if she knows if she's trained she might be able to prolong
00:25:56.52 --> 00:26:01.72 that conflict long enough for her backup to arrive she might be able to stay alive keep control
00:26:01.72 --> 00:26:08.60 of her gun whatever you know keep control of the situation long enough that she that she will
00:26:08.60 --> 00:26:15.000 get her backup there so that right there that's the same thing I tell females that want self defense
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.64 it's like hey look I'm not saying you can't because you look at some of our female
00:26:19.64 --> 00:26:26.60 jujitsu players they will choke out a dude deflect straight up they will arm lock them like for real
00:26:26.60 --> 00:26:32.76 and a 200 pound wrestler they'll put a guitino on them and choke them put them sleep so that's
00:26:32.76 --> 00:26:37.24 that can happen that's what someone that's really skilled to make up for their lack of strength
00:26:37.24 --> 00:26:45.24 and lack of size being a female but what if even if you're not that good but you can post
00:26:45.24 --> 00:26:49.48 phone you can prolong someone trying to grab you and take you somewhere someone trying to do something
00:26:49.48 --> 00:26:56.76 to you you can prolong it the longer you can delay the the offense from taking place
00:26:57.32 --> 00:27:00.60 the better chance you have of somebody else coming along or somebody noticing or that person
00:27:00.60 --> 00:27:05.48 just giving up because most most criminals are you know weak minded and they don't want that kind of
00:27:05.48 --> 00:27:13.96 resistance so yes totally you're asking why isn't it there's a bunch of reason why it isn't
00:27:13.96 --> 00:27:20.92 and one of them and I've talked about this before but there was there's been cases where people
00:27:20.92 --> 00:27:26.36 that were not trained enough they were trained enough to be dangerous where they've choked guys
00:27:26.36 --> 00:27:31.16 to death and that has happened you crush someone's windpipe you can be screwing around
00:27:31.56 --> 00:27:35.80 and or you just not screwing around but you can be screwing around you could you know you and I
00:27:35.80 --> 00:27:40.36 could could start wrestling around if you and I were white belts and we started going out at
00:27:40.36 --> 00:27:44.84 really hard there's a chance one of us could get the other one in a chokehold had a couple drinks
00:27:44.84 --> 00:27:51.000 in us and next thing you know I put you to sleep which is oh yeah I'm gonna put you to sleep
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.72 because sometimes you choke your friend you're like I'm gonna put you to sleep
00:27:54.68 --> 00:27:59.24 well if I'm drunk and you're drunk and I put you to sleep and I don't really know that you're
00:27:59.24 --> 00:28:02.92 a sleep yet and I'm squeezing extra hard because I'm drunk next thing you know I look up
00:28:02.92 --> 00:28:08.12 and all of a sudden your highway bone is crushed your wimppipe and you're now gonna die so
00:28:08.12 --> 00:28:13.72 that's happened in law enforcement they've banned chokes which is a horrible thing because choking is a
00:28:14.36 --> 00:28:22.60 is one of the best and most minimal forces to use to subdue someone is to choke them even an
00:28:22.60 --> 00:28:27.16 armlock is gonna break their arm it's gonna ruin their tendons it's gonna hurt them a choke
00:28:27.16 --> 00:28:33.000 doesn't even hurt someone it just puts them to sleep just make a pass so but that's one of the
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.04 reasons why they don't teach it as much the other reason is they don't give enough
00:28:38.04 --> 00:28:45.24 training to law enforcement officers and they need to they train an absolutely pathetic
00:28:46.12 --> 00:28:50.68 amount of time in what they call defensive tactics generally they please officers call defensive
00:28:50.68 --> 00:28:56.68 tactics which is them fighting and maintaining weapon retention and all that they train
00:28:57.24 --> 00:29:04.36 a very small number of hours a year they measure the time that they train in in a year in hours
00:29:04.36 --> 00:29:13.72 that's how little they train so my my campaign I'd like to go forward with is I think that police
00:29:13.72 --> 00:29:19.56 officers should spend one fifth of their active duty time training one fifth of their time should
00:29:19.56 --> 00:29:25.16 be training that's the way it should work and I don't know how I'm gonna start that ground wave but
00:29:25.16 --> 00:29:33.32 there's that's such a solid idea that no one can argue against it there's not one single argument
00:29:33.32 --> 00:29:39.000 against every police officer spending one fifth of their time training and and if you want to
00:29:39.72 --> 00:29:44.52 argue with me about that and the argument is well we won't have enough police officers out on the beat
00:29:44.52 --> 00:29:51.72 then and here's the question back at that would you rather have eight highly qualified highly trained
00:29:51.72 --> 00:29:57.64 officers out on the beat or ten officers that were barely trained at all and the answer is so easy
00:29:57.64 --> 00:30:04.44 that question so that's a bunch of things I'll continue to push that as much as I can and I know a
00:30:04.44 --> 00:30:08.92 ton of law enforcement people listen to this and just you know I think that's a great idea to start
00:30:08.92 --> 00:30:14.04 pushing from the ground from the grassroots we want one fifth of our time training it's going to
00:30:14.04 --> 00:30:19.32 make us all better it's going to prevent think of all the time that's hours that are wasted in legal
00:30:19.32 --> 00:30:24.12 actions after there's a bad shooting or an injury or something like that think of all the stuff
00:30:24.12 --> 00:30:28.92 that gets wasted there take the officers and train them properly that's what that's what needs to
00:30:28.92 --> 00:30:36.60 happen so hopefully it will and then what would you suggest that I mean kind of isn't what you can
00:30:36.60 --> 00:30:42.60 say but suggest like you know police officers going and getting training on their own so like you know
00:30:42.60 --> 00:30:46.36 yes if you have to go get training on your own go get training on your own because most
00:30:46.36 --> 00:30:51.40 due to places they'll have a law enforcement like some kind of you know yeah yeah yeah actually
00:30:51.40 --> 00:30:56.68 this guy you know Craig right and now me yeah yeah yeah okay police officer up in Oregon
00:30:56.68 --> 00:31:02.28 and from not mistaken always doing due to like with his uniform on and you can look look
00:31:02.28 --> 00:31:07.24 look him up on Instagram you can see all the stuff he does with due due to any applies it to law
00:31:07.24 --> 00:31:13.16 enforcement yeah yeah and it like man it's such a clear demonstration of the benefits and you know
00:31:13.16 --> 00:31:18.04 whatever everyone who trains like you know it's like man it becomes really after you train for a while
00:31:18.04 --> 00:31:23.96 all this dealing with other people in chaotic situations right he's literally easy yeah it's easy
00:31:23.96 --> 00:31:28.76 so man yeah get watch Craig and his stuff and I don't and here's the thing though I don't know
00:31:28.76 --> 00:31:33.56 how that works with like work and you know hey you're at risk of injury I don't know I don't know
00:31:33.56 --> 00:31:39.64 what the whole deal is but man the way I say it man trains or Craig's over there training all the time
00:31:39.64 --> 00:31:49.72 train and so man yeah just train on your own until your situation arises with the law enforcement
00:31:49.72 --> 00:31:54.36 yeah well hopefully they'll implement that sometime in the future man next question
00:31:55.32 --> 00:32:03.000 bow or not okay and due to his three months in professor not bowing I don't
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:10.36 other practitioners bow no one told me when in Rome versus I'm not in a herd respect a professor
00:32:10.36 --> 00:32:17.24 mats and practitioners this pretty simple question some people bow when they go on the mat some
00:32:17.24 --> 00:32:22.36 people bow to the professor some people don't I don't I just kind of do whatever and it doesn't
00:32:22.36 --> 00:32:28.36 really matter to me and there's a little bit of paranoia in the question which I I understand which is like
00:32:28.36 --> 00:32:32.68 hey hey when in Rome do his Romans do but at the same time you know I'm going to hold the line
00:32:32.68 --> 00:32:37.72 kind of on my personal value so it's like I don't I'm not bowing right that's not my gig or I
00:32:37.72 --> 00:32:43.000 it's respect you got about like there's both those extremes and both of them can be articulated in
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.88 a way that's fine and to me I'm just like whatever oh everyone looks like everyone's bound cool in
00:32:47.88 --> 00:32:52.60 the bow and not that big of a deal I don't I don't freak out about it it's not that big of a deal I think
00:32:52.60 --> 00:33:01.56 it to me to me the overall arching principle of my actions bowing or not bowing is more based on my
00:33:01.56 --> 00:33:07.32 overall principle of not making a spectacle out of myself one way or the other like I'm not here to
00:33:07.32 --> 00:33:14.28 like draw attention and be like hey I don't bow or hey this is jujitsu you need to respect them that
00:33:14.28 --> 00:33:20.44 I'm like over here just trying to train yeah not trying to make a big deal out of myself yeah so
00:33:20.44 --> 00:33:25.16 if everyone's bowing it's that cool like they know no big deal I get it or if no one's bowing and it's like
00:33:25.16 --> 00:33:32.60 hey I don't know big deal yeah I guess people might be disappointed better I have some hard stance right
00:33:32.60 --> 00:33:38.20 yeah but I don't yeah there's there's some things I don't worry about that's one of them yes
00:33:38.20 --> 00:33:43.24 I believe that yeah how about we just trade yeah agree and that's that'll sort of itself out anyway
00:33:43.24 --> 00:33:47.32 because if you're at a school because some schools sort of require that's the protocol here at the school
00:33:47.32 --> 00:33:50.36 no big deal but you can have that exact attitude be like cool that's what we're doing that's cool
00:33:50.36 --> 00:33:55.24 because some people you bow on the mat you bow off the mat you at the beginner class to the you know
00:33:55.24 --> 00:34:00.84 to the picture whatever at the end like the whole deal but same deal it's like bowing's not hard to do
00:34:00.84 --> 00:34:05.80 it doesn't like you know affect your family life at home or nothing like that it's just just bow
00:34:06.44 --> 00:34:11.16 same thing we're not bowing doesn't affect your yeah it's not hard to not bow down now I guess there's a line
00:34:11.16 --> 00:34:17.56 in either direction right there you know where you could you know you could be telling me like okay
00:34:17.56 --> 00:34:24.76 when we bow you need to bow and you need to praise yeah praise the praise instructor whoever
00:34:24.76 --> 00:34:29.56 it's like hmm okay probably not I'm probably not gonna do that you know like we're not we're not
00:34:29.56 --> 00:34:35.24 worshiping right we're not bowing it's like okay a little sign respect cool I got that but we're not
00:34:35.24 --> 00:34:40.44 gonna turn a respect into a worship there's a line that that will not be crossed the other
00:34:40.44 --> 00:34:45.32 direction is like oh you know someone's teaching a class and I'm just gonna you know run my
00:34:45.32 --> 00:34:49.16 mouth and walk on a mat like it's no big deal now like you're gonna be respectful to the instructor
00:34:49.16 --> 00:34:53.96 of course so I'm just gonna find out little balance there balance those two dichotomies so what if
00:34:54.68 --> 00:35:03.16 you go as a guest or whatever and another place and there their protocol is in your opinion like
00:35:03.16 --> 00:35:08.92 sorted crossed over to worship I haven't really been through an academy or whatever in worship
00:35:08.92 --> 00:35:13.24 but let's say it did just a little bit like would you go as a guest do you just go through the
00:35:13.24 --> 00:35:19.80 motions of respect for I might what I would probably do is go through the motions but then do
00:35:19.80 --> 00:35:26.68 other actions that would indicate to everyone that I have a free mind and that I'm not down
00:35:26.68 --> 00:35:31.48 with what they just did type of scenario like I wouldn't be obnoxious about it but I'd be like oh
00:35:31.48 --> 00:35:36.60 you know what I'm gonna do is take off my gear and sit on the mat right now like yeah oh oh that's
00:35:36.60 --> 00:35:41.16 not a lot okay sorry cool oh my bad though yeah you know big they put it on like I you know cool
00:35:41.16 --> 00:35:46.36 whatever just kind of like just indicate would you say at my academy like we don't care about these
00:35:46.36 --> 00:35:51.72 small things yeah maybe like um I don't know if I do that because then you're just trying to
00:35:51.72 --> 00:35:55.48 try to again make a spectacle I'm not trying to make a spectacle man I'm just trying to
00:35:55.48 --> 00:36:00.20 just try to just try to be you know just trying to get some training and to be honest with you
00:36:00.20 --> 00:36:05.80 I just go get training yeah so don't make a spectacle and get in the wet and let that spectacle get in the
00:36:05.80 --> 00:36:11.08 way of your training yeah how often are we making I mean how often do people try and make
00:36:11.08 --> 00:36:17.16 spectacles out of themselves it's like people do that yeah and that's not cool like don't do that
00:36:17.16 --> 00:36:24.12 don't be a spectacle just be you know I thought a story before about the the when I went to
00:36:24.12 --> 00:36:30.28 the University of San Diego and there was a professor there that was like oh she was an American but
00:36:30.28 --> 00:36:37.40 she was a Buddhist monk right you know so she had at some point converted to Buddhism and and she
00:36:37.40 --> 00:36:41.72 would shave her head and walk around in the robes and stuff like that and I was like we know one of
00:36:41.72 --> 00:36:47.08 the tenants of you know being Buddhist is to like not make a spectacle for yourself and yet here
00:36:47.08 --> 00:36:53.72 you are walking around a western campus you know you know in a uniform with a shaved head that's
00:36:53.72 --> 00:36:59.32 not that's not that you are making a spectacle of yourself so I was just like I would I would think
00:36:59.32 --> 00:37:06.68 it would be more like the Buddha to just wear you know a pair of jeans and a t-shirt and just have
00:37:06.68 --> 00:37:12.84 like whatever normal just be a normal just like as normal as possible yeah there's a whole like
00:37:12.84 --> 00:37:17.80 there's a whole thing that's sort of my that's sort of I I fall into a I fall back on that you know
00:37:17.80 --> 00:37:24.60 like a lot yeah so because you think that she might argue well this is how a some Buddhists
00:37:25.32 --> 00:37:32.68 like minimalize our whole efforts to have individuality or whatever but at the end of the day you are
00:37:32.68 --> 00:37:37.08 yeah like we're just like when you're in Thailand which is awesome like the Buddhist monks
00:37:37.08 --> 00:37:41.80 they're everywhere and they're that's what they do and so they're not making a spectacle of
00:37:41.80 --> 00:37:46.04 themselves at all and they come around and get rice in the morning it's very cool it's a very cool
00:37:46.04 --> 00:37:53.08 culture but if you're in a culture of a Southern California university there's no other Buddhist
00:37:53.08 --> 00:37:58.20 monks that are walking around so you kind of and hey maybe I'm wrong you know I'm not trying
00:37:58.20 --> 00:38:03.24 to disparage you know this individual I'm just saying from my perspective I was like if you really
00:38:03.24 --> 00:38:13.08 want to have the the low profile and not bring attention to yourself and give up you know give up
00:38:13.08 --> 00:38:20.68 the the trappings of ego right you want to give up the trappings of ego then you don't want
00:38:20.68 --> 00:38:25.80 people to notice you if you don't want people to notice you you dress like a gray man you just
00:38:25.80 --> 00:38:32.68 just like kind of normal you know forgettable yeah so anyways I'm trying to get like deep into
00:38:32.68 --> 00:38:43.000 the religious aspect of jiu jitsu and robes sure but that's just kind of my opinion I dig it
00:38:44.20 --> 00:38:52.92 next question did you ever have cct did you ever have a cct attached to your unit and if yes
00:38:54.68 --> 00:39:00.76 how was having them alongside and what advantages did they bring to the battlefield so cct is
00:39:00.76 --> 00:39:05.96 an air force combat controller and their special operations guys they're awesome guys they go through
00:39:05.96 --> 00:39:14.28 really hardcore training and I didn't really I worked with them occasionally not very directly
00:39:14.28 --> 00:39:19.80 on a couple occasions they were great guys but I never worked with them enough to to be talking
00:39:19.80 --> 00:39:22.76 about them all the time because I just didn't have that experience you know and don't talk about
00:39:24.20 --> 00:39:29.08 bull riders either because I don't know many of them you know so it's just it's just it's that but
00:39:29.08 --> 00:39:32.52 they're great guys I know they have an awesome reputation and my friends that work with them
00:39:33.48 --> 00:39:39.48 loved work with them if there was a guy that was I've had a couple guys kind of heard names of so
00:39:39.48 --> 00:39:43.56 for as far as coming on the podcast yeah of course I never fallen on the podcast of uh with our
00:39:43.56 --> 00:39:48.76 question no problem and what we what we had was we had anglico which was Dave Burke and his
00:39:48.76 --> 00:39:54.52 guys they were the guys that were doing the cct type mission for us when we were in remoddy so
00:39:54.52 --> 00:39:59.48 uh that's one of the reasons why we didn't work with them very much on that deployment the previous
00:39:59.48 --> 00:40:04.36 deployment we had my own I had my own jac and that's who we worked with so just just just
00:40:04.36 --> 00:40:11.80 uh just didn't have that opportunity so they're awesome guys though. Next question juggle currently
00:40:11.80 --> 00:40:17.80 in a busy and stressed place in life and keep looking back at what could have been how do you
00:40:17.80 --> 00:40:24.20 bounce back to doing you and not getting in your own head appreciate what you and I could do thank
00:40:24.20 --> 00:40:29.32 you both for and got blessed. All right you know we can look back all day long at what could have been
00:40:29.32 --> 00:40:33.24 and it doesn't matter well the only thing that matters from the past is what you learn from it
00:40:33.24 --> 00:40:37.32 so let's learn from it and look at the future and one one thing I'll say is
00:40:40.04 --> 00:40:45.24 it's like they're saying about when's a good time to plan a tree do you know when the
00:40:45.24 --> 00:40:53.56 good best time to plan a tree is right now either 22 years ago or right now right like that's
00:40:53.56 --> 00:40:57.96 look you didn't do it then so guess what you can do you do it now when's the best time to start
00:40:57.96 --> 00:41:03.96 a savings account. Yeah the same thing like I you know 20 years ago or right now so
00:41:05.16 --> 00:41:09.40 if you sit there and say oh well I could have done if I wish I would have done this years ago
00:41:09.40 --> 00:41:13.16 I wish well guess what you look up at a year and you don't have that little sattling now
00:41:13.16 --> 00:41:18.44 you could have a little sattling right you're nothing so it's not that big of a deal
00:41:18.44 --> 00:41:24.68 hey hey you you you went through life you made some you wasted some time good you didn't waste
00:41:24.68 --> 00:41:28.28 it completely first of all you learned from it you got experience you had fun you did other things
00:41:28.28 --> 00:41:33.24 you you learned about you learned about relationships because some girl dumped you and you
00:41:33.24 --> 00:41:37.80 realize that you can't overcome it to a to a liar you know you like you learned these things right
00:41:37.80 --> 00:41:42.52 so just because things were negative experiences in the past and they didn't feel good to go
00:41:42.52 --> 00:41:46.44 through doesn't mean that they were all bad because you still took something away from you
00:41:46.44 --> 00:41:52.92 and you learned from it so that's part one part two is what are you going to do plan a tree today
00:41:52.92 --> 00:41:57.000 that's what you're going to do plan a tree today and start to nourish that tree and take the
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.12 lessons that you learned to sprinkle on that tree and feed that tree so it can grow fast that tree
00:42:02.12 --> 00:42:05.08 that you plant today should be able to grow faster than the one you would have planned 20 years ago
00:42:05.08 --> 00:42:11.56 because you have the knowledge on how to on how to nourish that tree and feed that tree so it can
00:42:11.56 --> 00:42:15.56 grow quicker so just get on the path don't don't play around with what's going on in the past
00:42:15.56 --> 00:42:21.96 learn from it move on you man that goes along with how like that little speech it wasn't a speech
00:42:21.96 --> 00:42:28.12 but a little talk you had with me about you know you got to play the long game or whatever and
00:42:28.12 --> 00:42:32.52 in kind of in this case same deal where it's kind of in more so than even play that you are playing
00:42:32.52 --> 00:42:36.20 the long game but keep the long game in mind because that's what you know those thoughts like
00:42:36.20 --> 00:42:40.12 dang I should have I should have went to college or I should have chinointica I don't know
00:42:40.12 --> 00:42:45.96 whatever this whole what could have been kind of deal that's like your mind saying like right now
00:42:45.96 --> 00:42:50.36 if I would have done that back then right now I would have this and that's the part that kind of
00:42:50.36 --> 00:42:54.76 message like jams you up mentally right where you're like man I could have had this right now so when you
00:42:54.76 --> 00:43:01.64 think so you don't you so as a result typically in my experience anyway which is almost none
00:43:01.64 --> 00:43:07.88 but typically I think like wait I because when I think of what could have been because of this
00:43:07.88 --> 00:43:13.16 thing that I kind of want right now I don't want a seed right now I want what I could have had
00:43:13.16 --> 00:43:18.12 and that's what I want I have that so point to see yeah so but like I emotionally or mentally
00:43:18.12 --> 00:43:22.60 you that's not where your mind is your mind isn't like hey I can't have that I accept that so let's
00:43:22.60 --> 00:43:27.64 you think of the future now your mind doesn't do that it's more like hung up on on that right
00:43:27.64 --> 00:43:33.48 of what you don't have right now that empty void that you have you don't want to feel that void
00:43:33.48 --> 00:43:41.32 with a seed the seed doesn't do nothing for me that even a sapling that's a full grown tree that's
00:43:41.32 --> 00:43:47.16 what I want right now that's what I could have had so how is a seed the problem or or the solution
00:43:47.16 --> 00:43:52.12 to my problem but if you're looking at the big picture the long game is you so I'll
00:43:52.12 --> 00:43:57.96 like pointly put it at the better the seed is nothing but a tree at a different time that's really
00:43:57.96 --> 00:44:02.92 what it is seems aimed so that is the problem that is a solution seems aimed and that might be
00:44:02.92 --> 00:44:10.04 the most philosophically bold and and unbounded statement you've made on this the seed is nothing but
00:44:10.04 --> 00:44:19.08 a tree at a different time like I did that good job it's all the more fit the pain and suffering
00:44:19.08 --> 00:44:28.36 listening has finally paid off good good cool man thank you anyway so yeah I think if like
00:44:28.36 --> 00:44:34.04 you can keep that long game in mind that's helped me like a lot with just even like small little
00:44:34.04 --> 00:44:39.40 things you know stuff is like uncomfortable I want to do this right now but you know this exact thought
00:44:39.40 --> 00:44:43.96 like man I'm I'm looking forward to the day that I'm not I'm thinking the opposite of what could
00:44:43.96 --> 00:44:49.32 have been I'm thinking now I'm thinking I'm so glad I planted that seed last year or whatever
00:44:49.32 --> 00:44:54.36 you know so you can look at the long game and kind of fulfill all that stuff sure all right anyway
00:44:54.36 --> 00:45:00.20 next question hi jockel and echo and name is both by the way here but hi jockel and echo
00:45:00.20 --> 00:45:07.88 quick question I really get I get really bad anxiety doing almost everything for example when talking
00:45:07.88 --> 00:45:13.000 to people I always feel like as if I'm gonna say something stupid and this makes me start to
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:20.52 stutter and lose my train of thought and I just go blank hey it's on that one first of all
00:45:20.52 --> 00:45:25.08 you got a condition yourself you know you got a practice you got a rehearse I'll actually first
00:45:25.08 --> 00:45:29.72 of all I would say go get some speech therapy if someone to help you out because that will that will
00:45:29.72 --> 00:45:34.52 be beneficial to you getting someone that's a professional to to come in and say like okay here's
00:45:34.52 --> 00:45:40.84 the drills that we're gonna do my buddy that drums in my band he there's drumming drills that you
00:45:40.84 --> 00:45:47.64 can do so you can get your left hand to do something different than your left foot and your right
00:45:47.64 --> 00:45:52.04 hand to do something there's drills that you can do to overcome because if you're like me you're
00:45:52.04 --> 00:45:58.12 not a drummer I my right hand and right foot are gonna do the same thing at the same time my left
00:45:58.12 --> 00:46:01.80 hand and my left foot are gonna do the same thing at the same time but there's drills that you
00:46:01.80 --> 00:46:06.52 can do to overcome that and there's drills that you can do with speech so you can practice and you
00:46:06.52 --> 00:46:12.84 rehearse and you think about it then you'll get better at it and the cool thing is like once you
00:46:12.84 --> 00:46:17.88 start to build some confidence then you get more and more confident and you'll get better and better it the
00:46:17.88 --> 00:46:23.000 other thing I would say is talk about things that you know right don't try and explain things that you
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.20 don't know don't try and come up with some theory that you don't understand and try and just roll it
00:46:28.20 --> 00:46:33.32 out off the tip of your tongue because you don't know it so just when that's happening just sit back
00:46:33.32 --> 00:46:36.68 and kind of formulate your thoughts and think okay of all the things I'm thinking right now what
00:46:36.68 --> 00:46:42.44 do I actually kind of have a grip on maybe it's a question sometimes forming something in a question
00:46:42.44 --> 00:46:46.20 will make it easier for you to state it because you're saying hey I got a question and now you're
00:46:46.20 --> 00:46:52.28 not putting pressure on yourself to come up with this perfect yarn of why that you this theory that you
00:46:52.28 --> 00:46:56.76 out instead you post something as a question that'll take some pressure off you and talk about things
00:46:56.76 --> 00:46:59.88 that you know and if you don't know it then ask a question about it and that'll get you more
00:46:59.88 --> 00:47:04.92 comfortable and you keep talking and keep trying and over time you'll get better and better at it
00:47:04.92 --> 00:47:12.20 but yet you have to you have to not jump in like don't go and volunteer to give the speech at the
00:47:12.20 --> 00:47:19.64 local club right no volunteer to when people are having a conversation say hey can I ask a question
00:47:19.64 --> 00:47:25.16 about this start with that that's like the easiest entry point no it's expecting you to say anything
00:47:25.16 --> 00:47:28.76 brilliant when you ask a question then it's expecting you to ask a question yeah so it's not that
00:47:28.76 --> 00:47:36.60 big of a deal and then just build on that man it's exposure therapy exposure therapy next wish
00:47:36.60 --> 00:47:46.52 when you transitioned from E to an O how did your approach working with with man you previously
00:47:46.52 --> 00:47:53.56 served with as enlisted now that you were an officer this is such an easy question because
00:47:53.56 --> 00:47:57.64 the bottom line is when I transferred from being an enlisted guy to be an officer I didn't change
00:47:57.64 --> 00:48:03.40 anything in the way that I treated everyone I treated people the same and when I was a young
00:48:03.40 --> 00:48:09.24 enlisted guy or senior enlisted guy well more senior I was never like a I only made it to E five
00:48:09.24 --> 00:48:14.12 before I went officer but when I was in my third platoon with other guys that were not in their third
00:48:14.12 --> 00:48:19.16 platoon I treat people like hey man with you know hey this is what we're gonna do this how we're
00:48:19.16 --> 00:48:24.20 gonna make it happen now I gotta caveat that for the guys that were in pltunes with me when I was in the
00:48:24.20 --> 00:48:30.28 E five mafia hey I was a little crazy with the hazing and like you did suck to be a new guy
00:48:30.28 --> 00:48:37.56 in one of my platoon so I get that but as you guys have told me you appreciate it once you got a
00:48:37.56 --> 00:48:43.56 little you know once you saw the big picture there was appreciation but no from a from an actual
00:48:43.56 --> 00:48:47.40 working relationship hey you know what are you gonna do you gonna stay humble you're gonna treat
00:48:47.40 --> 00:48:53.000 people with respect regardless if you're above them or below them in the chain of command there's this
00:48:53.000 --> 00:49:01.08 saying that I didn't talk about when we had Derek a Raron and it's it's pulled from that speech
00:49:01.08 --> 00:49:05.64 by Jacqueline by gunnery sergeant Jacqueline he says at the end of the speech he says
00:49:06.68 --> 00:49:12.12 not above you not below you always beside you so think about that from a leadership perspective
00:49:12.12 --> 00:49:17.64 not above you not below you always beside you so then if you have that attitude look I'm not above
00:49:17.64 --> 00:49:23.48 when I'm not above you and I'm not below you like where equals and we're trying to figure out how
00:49:23.48 --> 00:49:28.76 to best solve this problem and if you treat people like that regardless if you're above them or
00:49:28.76 --> 00:49:34.12 below them in the chain of command you'll treat with respect and humility you'll be fine and that's
00:49:34.12 --> 00:49:38.76 what I did I didn't treat anybody any different and I mean I had I had guys that worked for that
00:49:38.76 --> 00:49:46.76 worked for me that had been my peers or that I had worked for before when I when I went through
00:49:46.76 --> 00:49:53.08 that transition and it was like no factor it was literally no factor because these guys were you know
00:49:53.08 --> 00:49:56.68 when we were friends we worked together we focused on getting the job done when they were above
00:49:56.68 --> 00:50:00.04 me in the chain of command what did I do I worked hard to focus on getting the job done when they
00:50:00.04 --> 00:50:04.36 were below me in the chain of command oh no it's like hey they're working hard did they become a
00:50:04.36 --> 00:50:10.68 less of a person did I become more of a person no no I put a different rank on my sleeve what does
00:50:10.68 --> 00:50:18.20 that mean nothing it doesn't mean it it means yeah what does it mean it means that I'm going to be
00:50:18.20 --> 00:50:22.76 given this brief instead of some other guy cool no big deal you know what why don't you give the brief
00:50:22.76 --> 00:50:30.36 I'm fine with that yeah so yeah respect humility and never above you never below you always
00:50:30.36 --> 00:50:35.16 besides you it's a good little thing to think about there okay did you ever have the
00:50:35.16 --> 00:50:40.28 situations where you throwing darts at the guys back at the bar you know for your hazing situation
00:50:40.28 --> 00:50:46.36 no sure we did some pretty we did some pretty rough hazing though for sure you know lots of
00:50:47.08 --> 00:50:53.72 yeah it was it was not fun it wasn't fun it wasn't fun you know and and it was part of the ritual
00:50:53.72 --> 00:50:59.40 back in the day it's not as much as it any as it is not as much as that anymore but you know guess
00:50:59.40 --> 00:51:04.12 what guys are fighting a war now so I'm not like oh little guys don't have it or sorry guess what
00:51:04.12 --> 00:51:08.12 when I got when I was in the teams it when I first got to the teams it was like oh cool you're in the
00:51:08.12 --> 00:51:12.68 teams yeah you're gonna get hazed oh guess what these guys are getting nowadays they're gonna get shot at
00:51:13.32 --> 00:51:20.04 they're gonna get you know hit with iEDs so not that big of a deal it's just a little bit of a
00:51:20.04 --> 00:51:25.96 culture change and that's the way it is next question that caught a minute of leadership has some
00:51:25.96 --> 00:51:31.72 great principles what is an appropriate philosophy concerning time to train versus manage out
00:51:31.72 --> 00:51:38.68 a direct report when they have been in the role for over a year yeah this changes from industry
00:51:38.68 --> 00:51:42.84 industry to industry to spend depending on the situation that you're in and sometimes you don't have
00:51:42.84 --> 00:51:46.84 you have a really tight timeline to get people up to speed and if they don't get up to speed you
00:51:46.84 --> 00:51:50.28 got to get rid of them otherwise it's gonna cost the team or it's gonna cost the company money
00:51:50.28 --> 00:51:55.24 so how long you're gonna give them you're gonna give them as much time as you think you can
00:51:55.24 --> 00:51:58.76 give them before they start detracting from the team you're also gonna make sure that you're not
00:51:58.76 --> 00:52:02.60 investing so much time in a one person to try and get them up to speed that you're ignoring
00:52:02.60 --> 00:52:05.64 everyone else and now it's having a negative impact on the team so you just gotta look at the
00:52:05.64 --> 00:52:09.96 timing again I work with construction companies where if they don't get a job done on done on time
00:52:09.96 --> 00:52:15.56 it'll cost them $60,000 a day they don't play around like they're using someone that's going to
00:52:15.56 --> 00:52:20.52 be able to get the job done you get some sales organization that's commission only and there's
00:52:20.52 --> 00:52:23.40 somebody that's taken a while to get up to speed they don't really care it's not cost in the company
00:52:23.40 --> 00:52:28.36 anything so you got to figure out in your industry how much time that looks like and then you
00:52:28.36 --> 00:52:33.56 got to set the expectations clearly and once you've done that you say okay listen bud I've been
00:52:33.56 --> 00:52:37.88 working with you for this amount of time here's where I want you to be at this date if you don't get
00:52:37.88 --> 00:52:42.12 there we're gonna move you out man it's the way it is pretty straightforward
00:52:44.12 --> 00:52:50.68 next question I have to co-exist at times with an individual who knows I'm X Army he purposely
00:52:50.68 --> 00:52:58.92 makes pro-tally band quips to piss me off as I'm in a position I can't do much about it
00:53:00.92 --> 00:53:09.24 his intent to anger works but I don't show it what's some advice yeah I mean this guy's just just
00:53:10.04 --> 00:53:14.60 I would just completely ignore you know and actually you know hey that's funny man cool
00:53:14.60 --> 00:53:20.52 he's obviously trying to get under your skin and just don't let him get under your skin that's
00:53:20.52 --> 00:53:26.92 just all there is to it this person is worthless and just ignore him I mean you could go to the
00:53:26.92 --> 00:53:34.28 extreme of taking like in marks mission where mark actually gets in on the joke you know and
00:53:34.28 --> 00:53:40.52 if you want it you know but then you might be crossing again I don't know the specifics of the situation
00:53:40.52 --> 00:53:45.24 because there's times where that's not like I wouldn't do that in certain situations like
00:53:45.24 --> 00:53:49.80 like no I'll ignore you but I'm not gonna play along with this joke the way you're saying it
00:53:49.80 --> 00:53:54.76 but there's times where I be that oh yeah guess what you know I might play along with a joke just to
00:53:54.76 --> 00:54:00.84 diffuse it again if this might be a this might be a guy that doesn't deserve that but yeah
00:54:01.48 --> 00:54:05.88 ignore it man go don't even worry about this idiot that's that's my advice yeah that
00:54:05.88 --> 00:54:13.000 ignore thing you do that super good where it's literally like you feel like you don't you got
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:19.08 no feedback from my little joke like if I make a joke to you or something and it's almost like
00:54:19.08 --> 00:54:23.88 did he not hear my joke because he just sort of moved on you know kind of thing and it's really
00:54:23.88 --> 00:54:29.24 compelling me to like not tell that joke anymore you know kind of thing and I'm assuming
00:54:29.24 --> 00:54:36.52 it works really good actually and he actually did have an example like the guy would say
00:54:36.92 --> 00:54:40.84 hey you're aiding the Taliban with this with the check this week like I don't know if the check is
00:54:40.84 --> 00:54:46.36 junk or this week's check anyway yeah so it seems like he's trying to be funny you know like
00:54:46.36 --> 00:54:50.84 he's not trying to be a dick to the guy like he says he's purposely trying to piss him off
00:54:51.48 --> 00:54:54.28 and yeah so for me if you're purposely trying to piss me off
00:54:54.28 --> 00:54:58.68 pitting me getting pissed off is you running that's the thing I'm not gonna let that happen yeah
00:54:58.68 --> 00:55:02.52 you're gonna win how am I gonna win by not getting pissed off yeah and you're a little
00:55:02.52 --> 00:55:07.48 and you're ignore tactic that you do in real life by the way yeah and I'm not saying like the
00:55:07.48 --> 00:55:12.52 ignore where you're like like a little kidty horse like a little kidty glee just ignore him and they
00:55:12.52 --> 00:55:18.68 like turn their back now it's like yeah you know just like yeah just like meaning was like you're
00:55:18.68 --> 00:55:28.36 your little quips literally mean nothing to me whatsoever yeah and that's a skill too which
00:55:28.36 --> 00:55:34.28 apparently you've honed over the years because it is and you gotta you can't oversell it you can't
00:55:34.28 --> 00:55:40.60 oversell ignoring somebody otherwise you're like you're not ignoring I got the power so you can't
00:55:40.60 --> 00:55:45.48 oversell it and you know underselling ignoring means like you're not really ignoring I guess but
00:55:45.48 --> 00:55:51.16 if you can nail it if you can nail it like literally your joke or your comments or whatever
00:55:51.16 --> 00:55:55.80 are falling on deaf ears you know and they don't like affect me at all if you can nail that
00:55:56.52 --> 00:56:01.96 yeah I would say that that would compel the normal person or this kind of person whatever to stop
00:56:02.68 --> 00:56:06.76 it where I think that works with everybody even little kids once again you don't make a
00:56:06.76 --> 00:56:10.60 spectacle out of yourself you're gonna let it roll like you're not making a spectacle of like
00:56:10.60 --> 00:56:15.24 I'm ignoring you don't make a spectacle of like hey shut up you just play in the metal and
00:56:15.24 --> 00:56:24.04 you just go through the because because there's things in life that don't matter yeah I'm not saying
00:56:24.04 --> 00:56:28.60 that you that there's that there's things that you don't react to because there certainly are
00:56:29.40 --> 00:56:35.08 and I'm not saying that you want to be this neutral person through for all things but there's things
00:56:35.08 --> 00:56:40.12 that just don't matter yeah there's things that just they just don't matter this is one of them
00:56:40.12 --> 00:56:45.88 this guy doesn't matter what is who is this guy yes it matter so don't put any effort into them
00:56:45.88 --> 00:56:51.24 just stay neutral oh give him a smile on a nod and keep doing what you're doing another tip too
00:56:51.24 --> 00:56:57.24 for this don't tell other people like oh yeah no man you forgot about that never totally just
00:56:57.24 --> 00:57:05.64 forgot about never tell anyone when something pisses you off never you know that way because if you do
00:57:05.64 --> 00:57:10.84 and then you're you're nailing the ignore tactic you're nailing oh yeah delivery perfectly
00:57:10.84 --> 00:57:17.24 and then you tell you told your friend or whatever like hey so that guy knows that always
00:57:17.24 --> 00:57:21.88 just ignoring me but I really pisses him off you know so just keep doing it and and here's the
00:57:21.88 --> 00:57:27.48 thing too about playing the game like um or or going along with the joke like oh yeah that's funny
00:57:28.12 --> 00:57:32.60 you just basically you kind of involve yourself in the game yeah he's not getting the payoff necessarily
00:57:32.60 --> 00:57:36.28 but he'll just change his tactic because you're still in the game with all you want to you want to
00:57:36.28 --> 00:57:40.68 get out of the game that's why that's why in that particular situation you know mark in Mark's
00:57:40.68 --> 00:57:46.84 mission was trying to befriend yeah yeah yeah yeah so that's a different situation he's not just
00:57:46.84 --> 00:57:53.40 trying to diffuse or he's trying to actually befriend him and so then he need to make a connection
00:57:53.40 --> 00:57:59.32 let's the clear difference if this guy was like a coworker or a boss or a subordinate then
00:57:59.32 --> 00:58:04.36 trying to build a relationship with then I might take a little step you know and again
00:58:04.36 --> 00:58:11.40 am I gonna joke about somebody being pro-talibant I'm not probably joking about the Taliban
00:58:11.40 --> 00:58:20.12 very much probably not no yeah cool next question is it better to remain single if you have a
00:58:20.12 --> 00:58:26.20 dangerous or demanding career in order to protect your family from unintended negative consequences
00:58:26.20 --> 00:58:33.64 or find a partner willing to embrace the risk and raise where your kids together hey man
00:58:34.84 --> 00:58:39.48 it's hard to live the life and it's a lot harder on your family than it is on you because you'll
00:58:39.48 --> 00:58:44.20 be over getting after it and your family will be at home not knowing what's going on with you
00:58:44.92 --> 00:58:53.56 so it's hard but I mean obviously having kids and raising a little warrior kids with a
00:58:53.56 --> 00:58:59.80 partner that's in the game is is awesome it's hard to find someone to get married to that's that
00:59:00.52 --> 00:59:07.40 good to go in the game especially if they're really young so I got real lucky I married a girl that kind
00:59:07.40 --> 00:59:16.44 of got it we'll say and and I said this when I was on Ben Shapiro's show that the quality that she had
00:59:16.44 --> 00:59:25.56 that still has that I think is is the most important is emotional independence and I don't even know
00:59:25.56 --> 00:59:29.16 if that's the thing I don't know if I just made that up but that's trying to describe that
00:59:29.88 --> 00:59:37.000 you know my wife doesn't need the the hey honey from me she doesn't need to like a hey how's
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:44.76 everything going she doesn't need that from me she's fine she's emotionally independent and of course
00:59:44.76 --> 00:59:49.80 she's independent in the way that she can take care of whatever the kids and the puking kids
00:59:49.80 --> 00:59:54.52 and the kids diapers and the kids with and the broken water heater and the flat tire on the
00:59:54.52 --> 01:00:01.40 cause you can handle all that stuff too when I was gone a lot but most important is she could
01:00:02.20 --> 01:00:08.84 she she didn't need the constant like emotional recharge from me because she's an independent
01:00:08.84 --> 01:00:13.88 stable human being of her own so I think that's the kind of thing you've got to look for now
01:00:13.88 --> 01:00:21.32 unfortunately a lot of times dudes are attracted to the person that's emotionally dependent on them
01:00:21.32 --> 01:00:27.16 because it makes no it's a little ego boost it makes him feel good like oh she needs me around
01:00:27.72 --> 01:00:31.24 and it's like that's so you got to watch out for that you got to find someone that kind of has
01:00:31.24 --> 01:00:38.36 their own thing going on which also has to be balanced because if you find a female that is too
01:00:38.36 --> 01:00:45.56 has too much independence then guess what she's gonna be around you can find somebody else so you
01:00:45.56 --> 01:00:51.48 got to find that balance as well but if you can find that that right person don't rush into it
01:00:51.48 --> 01:00:57.32 take your time and and and she's in the game then yeah man get after it
01:01:00.52 --> 01:01:05.72 gonna say that's a good question yeah it is like and you know a lot of times guys guys and
01:01:05.72 --> 01:01:10.84 here's another like this is just an it's an answer that's not really an answer and yet it's fully
01:01:10.84 --> 01:01:15.40 an answer hey I'm married and I'm thinking about going the seal team to what will this do to my
01:01:15.40 --> 01:01:21.96 marriage it's like oh there's a 50% chance your marriage is gonna get destroyed because you're
01:01:21.96 --> 01:01:27.08 gonna be gone all the time your wife is gonna be jealous of the teams she's gonna be jealous of the
01:01:27.08 --> 01:01:31.48 travel she's gonna be pissed that you're not home she's gonna be pissed that when you get home you're
01:01:31.48 --> 01:01:38.20 going to the bar with your boys instead of going to the recital for the daughter like that's that's
01:01:38.20 --> 01:01:45.32 a reality so yeah I can't recommend it at the same time if you're square away and you have a good
01:01:45.32 --> 01:01:50.60 relationship yeah it'll be awesome it'll be awesome but it's it's a really hard like when guys
01:01:50.60 --> 01:01:56.76 when I meet a guy that's 19 years old 20 years old and he says yeah you know I'm going to buds
01:01:56.76 --> 01:02:03.40 and I'm getting married this summer before I go straight up that's a bad idea that's a bad idea
01:02:03.40 --> 01:02:09.08 don't do that if you're not situation don't do that because if you are if you have a great
01:02:09.08 --> 01:02:13.88 relationship with that person say look I'm gonna go through buds I'm gonna be focused on that it's
01:02:13.88 --> 01:02:18.92 gonna take me some time I'm gonna show bit of team I'm gonna go on deployment I'm gonna come home
01:02:18.92 --> 01:02:22.92 it's gonna take about three years for all this to happen when we get done with all when I get
01:02:22.92 --> 01:02:29.88 done with all that we'll get married because we are so strong and so tight that we can get through
01:02:29.88 --> 01:02:35.72 three years without you know being married we cool let's see what kind of response you get for that
01:02:37.32 --> 01:02:43.80 because it's non-committal right because it's showing the female hey I'm non-committal
01:02:43.80 --> 01:02:46.60 when actually you're saying listen it's not that I'm non-committal I don't even know what
01:02:46.60 --> 01:02:49.96 I hold in the future I don't know what the future holds for me it's gonna be crazy I don't know
01:02:49.96 --> 01:02:55.88 what's gonna happen I don't want to drag you through a bunch of crap let's just pause on moving
01:02:55.88 --> 01:03:02.84 forward with the marriage part and once we get done with that you know give me give me two years
01:03:02.84 --> 01:03:06.84 give me three years and then you can see if you still want to be around you you think you want to be
01:03:06.84 --> 01:03:11.64 around right now you haven't had a you haven't had a dude that's going on deployment for seven months
01:03:11.64 --> 01:03:16.76 after he gets done with it one year work up where I was gone in 12 months I was gone nine months
01:03:16.76 --> 01:03:24.36 that's a whole another thing you you may not want to be in that situation you know maim
01:03:26.04 --> 01:03:32.04 so if you're in that situation yeah don't get married and do people pull it off sometimes yeah
01:03:32.04 --> 01:03:40.36 Flynn Cochrane got married I think before buts and so that's that's one guy but but it's a
01:03:40.36 --> 01:03:47.16 rare occasion and most of the time it doesn't work out as well as Flynn and it worked out for Flynn
01:03:47.16 --> 01:03:52.44 why did it work out for Flynn one of the reasons he married a girl that is emotionally independent
01:03:53.24 --> 01:04:01.40 and can do her own thing and wasn't waiting on you know that that that emotional boost you know
01:04:01.40 --> 01:04:07.88 so there you go and so it's and and here's the the final answer it's like you know
01:04:07.88 --> 01:04:13.72 what the right answer is you actually know it so many questions you actually know the answer
01:04:13.72 --> 01:04:21.56 too you want reinforcement of them and but but the only person that can answer these questions
01:04:21.56 --> 01:04:26.60 is you the person you got to listen to what I'm saying sure but you got to look at your
01:04:27.16 --> 01:04:31.64 future spouse and be like or potential spouse you're the one that knows
01:04:31.64 --> 01:04:41.72 mm-hmm now what's hard is guys especially guys they go head over heels for females yeah they go
01:04:41.72 --> 01:04:49.16 crazy they go nuts they don't even see straight yeah you can't I had guys in seal platoon
01:04:49.16 --> 01:04:55.64 where I was like listen hey bro this girl that you're involved with right now is going to ruin
01:04:55.64 --> 01:05:01.08 your life I want to tell you that let me tell you what she's done so far you're not married yet I
01:05:01.08 --> 01:05:09.88 know you want to get married in two weeks so far she stole your credit card she's called the command
01:05:10.52 --> 01:05:16.76 four times to request to talk to the master chief about your orgars this girl is a nightmare
01:05:16.76 --> 01:05:23.32 please do not marry her and guys like bro you don't understand and that's the way guys do
01:05:23.96 --> 01:05:29.64 and how do I know that because I was the same idiot when when you're 15 years old oh my god it's the
01:05:29.64 --> 01:05:36.12 only no it's like no that's not the only girl it's not there's more so just calm down
01:05:37.08 --> 01:05:43.000 if you can if you if the marriage is meant to be let it be but let it be in a year let it happen
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.60 in here don't be getting married in three months don't be getting married in two months don't
01:05:46.60 --> 01:05:51.000 don't don't get married in six months get married in a year get married in a year and a half
01:05:51.80 --> 01:05:58.28 do me a favor do yourself a favor do us all the favor that there you go
01:05:58.28 --> 01:06:04.92 sounds like sound advice thank you next question could you talk about how you read a book
01:06:04.92 --> 01:06:10.44 to get so much out of it that you do oh yeah um here's what I do in a read a book i read the book
01:06:10.44 --> 01:06:15.88 as i'm reading the book i highlight the important parts of the book then i go back through and
01:06:15.88 --> 01:06:22.28 reread what i highlight and pull out the pre the the creme the lacrim of the information
01:06:22.28 --> 01:06:27.000 another small thing if you're reading a book with lots of characters write down the characters and
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.20 kind of like give them a description so you can refer back to them when they show back up again
01:06:30.20 --> 01:06:34.76 because sometimes i'll lose track of characters if it's a complex book and you just don't you just
01:06:34.76 --> 01:06:41.64 don't know um so that's what i do i read slowly i actually it's horrible i wish i read faster
01:06:41.64 --> 01:06:45.88 i read at the speed that i talk just about i read a little bit faster but it's just about the
01:06:45.88 --> 01:06:51.80 speed that i talk and i read every single word i want to i will say this when i do read a book
01:06:51.80 --> 01:06:59.000 slowly and like i do read i remember a lot from the book which is cool but read it slowly
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:07.48 highlight it take notes there you go mix next question what was planned be if you
01:07:07.48 --> 01:07:12.60 rang the bell um there was no i wasn't gonna ring the bell wasn't gonna happen it's seriously
01:07:12.60 --> 01:07:18.04 wasn't gonna happen and but well here's what could happen injury you can get injured in butts
01:07:18.04 --> 01:07:25.16 yeah and some injuries are more preventative like shin splints if you train properly before
01:07:25.16 --> 01:07:30.60 hand you probably won't get shin splints but if you're doing rock porridge and you there's big
01:07:30.60 --> 01:07:37.56 waves and you're bringing a boat a zodiac boat or a ibs boat up the rocks in big waves you can
01:07:37.56 --> 01:07:42.52 just get your knee broke like you can happen so then what would happen if i would have gotten out of
01:07:42.52 --> 01:07:49.64 you don't go on to the fleet healed up come back so i would have done you know try again it's uh
01:07:49.64 --> 01:07:55.24 that's one of the scariest things about butts from a guy that like the guys that i know that
01:07:55.24 --> 01:08:01.24 were like yeah we're never gonna quit but they there's a possibility you're gonna get injured yeah
01:08:01.24 --> 01:08:05.96 can you get rolled they call it rolled yeah you get rolled back what but it like even if you get sick
01:08:05.96 --> 01:08:09.80 right like a doctor can be like hey you can't continue yep that can happen that can happen
01:08:09.80 --> 01:08:15.72 to guys in hell week they'll get pneumonia and they're just they can't like they're they're not
01:08:15.72 --> 01:08:22.68 quitting but they're coughing up blood they're speeding blood out of their mouth and they're like
01:08:23.64 --> 01:08:31.40 and the doctors like hey are you okay but i'm fine yeah and so they just have to they just have to
01:08:32.36 --> 01:08:37.24 get rolled back yeah it happens there's very few people that don't get rolled back oh yeah it's
01:08:37.24 --> 01:08:42.68 pretty small number that don't get rolled back at all really yeah like for medical
01:08:42.68 --> 01:08:48.28 medical failure if you fail something you get rolled back you fail a run i forget i don't know
01:08:48.28 --> 01:08:52.84 what is right now when i went through if you failed to run okay you got to write up if you failed
01:08:52.84 --> 01:08:56.68 another run you got rolled back see good to do the whole thing again you gotta do the whole thing
01:08:56.68 --> 01:09:02.68 yeah not just the run you gotta do everything again yeah yeah yeah oh thing oh it's a night
01:09:02.68 --> 01:09:14.92 so i failed a run us swim a obstacle course like and then you just freaked out
01:09:16.12 --> 01:09:21.48 i was so okay i think you could actually when i went through you could fail one per phase
01:09:21.48 --> 01:09:26.60 so there was three phases first phase second phase and third phase you could fail like one of
01:09:26.60 --> 01:09:32.92 each thing per phase which is with sounds really lenient but dang you're doing because you're doing a
01:09:32.92 --> 01:09:39.96 time run every week and a time run every week and then you're doing a million they just call
01:09:39.96 --> 01:09:47.96 a conditioning runs which is the most understated name for run ever because what they really
01:09:47.96 --> 01:09:53.16 were is just the most grueling as fast as you could go through the soft sand runs like for how
01:09:53.16 --> 01:10:00.92 long for air mouth no no no no no no and not only that you ran to you ran to breakfast and back
01:10:00.92 --> 01:10:03.80 then you ran to lunch and back and you ran to dinner and back and each one of those runs was
01:10:03.80 --> 01:10:08.76 one mile so there's six miles before you ran anywhere before you conditioning run and your time
01:10:08.76 --> 01:10:16.76 run you're doing a six mile run every day just that's awesome that is like that's not a sprint
01:10:16.76 --> 01:10:20.76 sometimes you have to run fast sometimes you run slow but it's just like a lot of times just the
01:10:20.76 --> 01:10:28.52 little you know typical military shuffle yeah so yeah
01:10:28.52 --> 01:10:31.24 no man.
01:10:31.24 --> 01:10:37.08 Question what actual strategy should a jiu jitsu white belt employ during a roll other than
01:10:37.08 --> 01:10:39.24 relax tap early tap off and etc.
01:10:39.24 --> 01:10:42.20 Well those are the key points but the other thing is I would say try and do moves that you've
01:10:42.20 --> 01:10:47.80 actually learned instead of instead of doing something that you that you just like you're
01:10:47.80 --> 01:10:51.72 spashing out trying to do some random thing you actually do something that you know and if you
01:10:51.72 --> 01:10:55.88 get in a situation that you don't know what to do remember the situation you were in since you
01:10:55.88 --> 01:11:01.32 can ask an instructor hey here's where I was I didn't know what do you can you please help me yeah
01:11:01.32 --> 01:11:09.96 simple pretty straightforward yeah next question if a coworker were attempting to bully
01:11:09.96 --> 01:11:16.84 intimidate or make you generally miserable do you go with it would you make a mention of your
01:11:16.84 --> 01:11:25.96 jitsu knowledge or keep it a surprise I like that question oh yeah I would keep it I'm I keep
01:11:25.96 --> 01:11:33.16 everything a surprise right I just keep everything a surprise because I'm not here like
01:11:33.88 --> 01:11:39.000 hey you know I do jitsu you better back off you know like what is that and then said you're just like
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:47.40 hey man all good you know and then let that guy find out for himself that you know the hard one yeah
01:11:47.40 --> 01:11:50.60 either the hard way or someone will be like hey man you know that guy that you keep messing with
01:11:50.60 --> 01:11:54.68 like I train jitsu every day he's gonna choke you up put you to sleep and then guess what he's
01:11:54.68 --> 01:11:58.92 gonna do he's gonna be a mouthy because he's already been he's already been testing you and he's like
01:11:58.92 --> 01:12:04.84 oh he's kind of a whim so yeah I mean there's no like is there even a cool way you can say I
01:12:04.84 --> 01:12:12.12 train jitsu no because even if you pull it off externally like internally you're like you know
01:12:12.12 --> 01:12:19.48 who said it cool John Cloud Vendam hoiler Gracie hoiler Gracie did it was surfing
01:12:20.28 --> 01:12:23.64 and I think kid Belegro told me this story but it might have been hoiler that told me this
01:12:24.44 --> 01:12:30.68 he was surfing and somebody wanted to know give him some beef get nuts if you wanted somebody wanted
01:12:30.68 --> 01:12:34.92 it like you know hey what are you doing out here times thing and he was like you know he did
01:12:34.92 --> 01:12:39.80 what I would do it see you know you just kept surfing kind and then the person started talking
01:12:39.80 --> 01:12:49.96 more and then he started running his mouth and then hoiler said something like um hey you like to surf
01:12:51.48 --> 01:12:59.96 I like to fight if you want to fight we can do that and I thought that was a pretty cool
01:12:59.96 --> 01:13:05.08 way to say it he told that story I think I was unless he told another time to you at Bryan
01:13:05.08 --> 01:13:10.76 Sargent's promotion to Blackbelt oh you were I think kid Belegro was here too I forget but yes
01:13:10.76 --> 01:13:17.80 he told me that story to like the group he told it to me and I thought you were there right
01:13:17.80 --> 01:13:22.12 yeah he was yeah I thought there was like kind of more actually he said it's cooler than that
01:13:22.12 --> 01:13:27.64 he said it cooler than that he said it some way that was like yeah listen you like to fight
01:13:27.64 --> 01:13:34.52 you like to surf for your life I fight for my life yeah you you surf for a living I fight for a
01:13:34.52 --> 01:13:38.84 living it was something even more than what I said but it was good yeah we can fight it kind of you
01:13:38.84 --> 01:13:42.76 can surf yeah it was a kind of thing where you're like if you were that guy you think you know
01:13:42.76 --> 01:13:49.08 you know yeah maybe I'll not do this whole thing right now I remember thinking the same thing is you
01:13:49.08 --> 01:13:54.76 like dank those are really dope what it's saying you know plus like you know that that guy obviously
01:13:54.76 --> 01:14:00.12 he didn't know who that was I'm assuming which would be kind of crazy if he didn't or if he
01:14:00.12 --> 01:14:05.64 did know who he was but and then what if hypothetically later he found out like who that was
01:14:05.64 --> 01:14:10.04 and he'd like occasionally I've had people say things like like they kind of know
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.64 who should I say like oh you know let's go you know something like that yeah and it's like yeah
01:14:15.64 --> 01:14:20.60 yeah I mean cool that's always mine that's awesome yeah cool like you want to go now and then
01:14:20.60 --> 01:14:28.28 there was like oh no no no just kidding all right next question what do you typically
01:14:28.28 --> 01:14:34.68 wear when you meet the bosses of companies and why oh uh they meant if you're working with
01:14:34.68 --> 01:14:41.72 Ashland front then pretty much what we all wear is the the EF pillow the Ashland front uh
01:14:41.72 --> 01:14:49.72 pillow shirt and you know we we we called the what we wear business tactical yeah just pillow shirt and
01:14:49.72 --> 01:14:56.60 pair of pants and what the question is why well that's just because it's uh it to me it's the
01:14:56.60 --> 01:15:02.28 same kind of thing I've been talking about just sort of a normal thing to wear right um don't really
01:15:02.28 --> 01:15:09.56 travel as much as I travel as little as possible I came with a full suit and yeah so just comfort
01:15:09.56 --> 01:15:16.28 and functionality yeah there's the answer yeah and of course you'll show up in your shorts yeah
01:15:16.28 --> 01:15:23.08 no no we're a professional and rascar yeah the remember you used to wear suit right like back
01:15:23.08 --> 01:15:29.40 in the yeah I mean and I still wear well wear a suit sometimes but usually not man usually not you know
01:15:29.40 --> 01:15:37.24 even um usually people people know who we are now yeah and so if we're gonna show up they realize
01:15:37.24 --> 01:15:41.000 what they're getting which is like hey these guys are these guys are gonna comment and talk to us
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.44 and they they know what the deal is yeah there's all the footage of us on on the videos and stuff
01:15:46.44 --> 01:15:53.40 where we're in kind of the EF uniform so business tactical get some all right next question
01:15:53.40 --> 01:16:01.96 and I guess there is a there is a a small bit of like hey we're not we're not standard business
01:16:01.96 --> 01:16:07.24 people you know in a man yeah that makes it it's like hey like you're in a room with people with a
01:16:07.24 --> 01:16:11.32 bunch of suits on and they're like oh who's presenting oh it's that guy over there because he's
01:16:11.32 --> 01:16:15.32 wearing something different okay we get it you know in a man yeah just a little identifier
01:16:15.32 --> 01:16:25.40 echelon front on the shirt oh good how do you grow better faster stronger with your romantic
01:16:25.40 --> 01:16:31.56 partner over time without being a brute I just I don't even I just kind of had to put this
01:16:31.56 --> 01:16:35.72 question in here because it was I don't really understand I mean just because you're bigger and
01:16:35.72 --> 01:16:40.92 faster and stronger doesn't mean you're a brute right what what is that I don't how do you overcome
01:16:40.92 --> 01:16:47.40 that be nice to your you know your girlfriend whoa you know wife um what's the your romantic
01:16:47.40 --> 01:16:51.80 partner like what does that mean no like with if you're working out with your romantic partner
01:16:51.80 --> 01:16:56.92 or like you're getting bigger and faster and stronger and therefore you start treating your
01:16:56.92 --> 01:17:03.40 girlfriend like crap like no it's like no it actually you'll probably be nicer because you're
01:17:03.40 --> 01:17:07.96 bigger and faster and stronger so it's kind of a non-question I guess but I just thought it was funny
01:17:09.24 --> 01:17:14.52 because you think you think I'm gonna do squats today then I'm just gonna go beyond the
01:17:14.52 --> 01:17:25.88 normal man being a brute look the being a brute that part I can see that you know because you
01:17:25.88 --> 01:17:32.76 know like let's say like you gained 20 pounds 30 pounds it's just and it's like all muscle you're
01:17:32.76 --> 01:17:38.60 super strong now you know and you know you come home you're just more of a like the stuff that you
01:17:38.60 --> 01:17:45.72 do you know you're vacuuming you know like you're just way more broodish you are yes so I don't know
01:17:45.72 --> 01:17:51.16 vacuum harder you're vacuuming with more finesse you got to focus on the finesse part of it
01:17:51.16 --> 01:17:58.28 otherwise you're gonna be all big fast and strong the the and I I think I understand a question
01:17:58.28 --> 01:18:05.32 but here's the here's the tip that I'm been married forever but significantly long
01:18:05.96 --> 01:18:12.12 here's what I found out like a lot of stuff like as a guy you think like hey I'm not really
01:18:12.12 --> 01:18:17.80 gonna do that because like that's not important you know like you you have a set of things that
01:18:17.80 --> 01:18:21.80 you think are important and they're based on certain ways of thinking then the girls gonna have things
01:18:21.80 --> 01:18:26.52 she thinks is important and in my experience which I from what I understand is very common
01:18:27.16 --> 01:18:34.28 that the things that some girls think are important they can't really put their finger on it
01:18:34.28 --> 01:18:39.16 or why they feel important or whatever but they just do you know and the guy will be like hey that's
01:18:39.16 --> 01:18:44.52 an important you can't even explain why it's important therefore you know I win the whole importance
01:18:44.52 --> 01:18:50.36 significance argument right so at the end of the day they're not gonna do these things just little things
01:18:50.36 --> 01:18:55.32 you know show me that you care like these sensitive things things that go against being
01:18:56.52 --> 01:19:03.72 faster stronger more British but if you can keep in mind that little little things even if you
01:19:03.72 --> 01:19:10.36 don't think they're significant actually do make your romantic partner happy and if you can
01:19:10.36 --> 01:19:16.52 consistently maintain that regardless of how big fast or strong you get that will help
01:19:17.48 --> 01:19:23.000 he's gonna embrace your big bigness fastness and strongness take it from the end no cool
01:19:24.52 --> 01:19:34.92 next question in cooperation and negotiation is there a tell to know when you're breaking
01:19:34.92 --> 01:19:42.60 your personal code and compromising too much is it a gut check or is it gut check or logical
01:19:42.60 --> 01:19:46.36 this is a weird one there's a kind of a confusing question so I just kind of kind of
01:19:47.64 --> 01:19:52.36 answer it to the best of my ability well the the biggest thing I notice when I'm
01:19:53.08 --> 01:19:58.44 when I'm interacting with other people the biggest thing that I pay attention to
01:19:58.44 --> 01:20:08.52 is am I paying it am do I care about this particular thing because of me or because of it's
01:20:08.52 --> 01:20:16.12 gonna help the team and if you can get through that if you if you really just say to yourself hey
01:20:16.12 --> 01:20:21.72 am I doing this because I'm gonna help the team or am I doing this because it's good about me
01:20:22.44 --> 01:20:27.000 if you pay attention to those things I'm not saying that every time that you say hey you know
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.48 what I need to take care of me a little bit because you you have to remember that you have your
01:20:31.48 --> 01:20:39.32 strategic goals too right but most of the time the success of the team is gonna help you strategic goals
01:20:40.28 --> 01:20:47.40 now so for me I'm my constant thing is hey why am I why why does this concern me does it concern
01:20:47.40 --> 01:20:52.36 me it's basically does this concern me because my ego or not and if it doesn't concern me because
01:20:52.36 --> 01:20:57.80 my ego then it concerns me because it's not gonna benefit the team so let's help the team so that's
01:20:57.80 --> 01:21:03.48 that's what I that's what I look at the most when I'm negotiating when I'm cooperating you know
01:21:03.48 --> 01:21:12.84 if if you and I were negotiating a deal right and I was gonna buy a car from you and I was like
01:21:13.40 --> 01:21:18.92 you know you want to sell it for me to for 10 grand and I want to get it for nine how much of it
01:21:18.92 --> 01:21:27.88 and you're like okay you know what jaco I got it on the lot for for 8800 can you give me
01:21:27.88 --> 01:21:34.60 $400 over the what I paid for it and give me 9200 or whatever and I'm like no
01:21:35.56 --> 01:21:41.56 how much of that is me just this is my ego I just want to mean the ego fight against you and how much of
01:21:41.56 --> 01:21:46.12 it is me like hey that's actually a pretty good deal and and why not take care of this guy because I don't
01:21:46.12 --> 01:21:51.16 know I don't really know you but hey man maybe we'll buy something else in the future maybe
01:21:51.16 --> 01:21:57.08 all you'll have you know what I mean so am I trying is is it my ego or is it just a bad deal if you're
01:21:57.08 --> 01:22:02.44 like hey nope it's 11000 and I'm like okay you know what I'm not gonna pay that so it's not it's not my
01:22:02.44 --> 01:22:08.92 ego that's just not a good deal at 10 grand it's not a great deal at 9200 it's a pretty damn good
01:22:08.92 --> 01:22:13.80 deal for me and it's you're gonna make some money and I'm happy that you're gonna make some money
01:22:13.80 --> 01:22:18.44 cool you know what let's say can so let's make a deal there's times where this is the so this is the point
01:22:18.44 --> 01:22:25.000 there's times where my ego I'll be like no I don't care I don't care if you're only gonna make 200
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.04 bucks that's that's your problem you should have paid so much when in my heart I know like hey
01:22:30.04 --> 01:22:33.88 that's actually a good deal I'm getting a really good deal but my ego is not letting me have closed
01:22:33.88 --> 01:22:39.32 close it that can be a fact that can be a problem so when I'm negotiating with someone
01:22:39.32 --> 01:22:44.84 and it's not a good deal they're not gonna get me to do what they want me to do it's just not
01:22:44.84 --> 01:22:51.24 gonna happen if it's a fair deal hey we'll make it work it's not a fair deal it's gonna be problematic
01:22:51.24 --> 01:22:56.68 you don't want to present me with unfair deals because I will not be accepting them
01:22:58.84 --> 01:23:05.24 also does it seem like this moral question I guess you you kind of got to like be truthful
01:23:05.24 --> 01:23:08.92 to yourself like consciously too right because when you could you give it like how you say you
01:23:08.92 --> 01:23:13.64 gotta ask yourself is this is this good for me and my ego or is this good for the team like
01:23:13.64 --> 01:23:19.32 as far as me not compromising my you know who not compromising or my personal code or whatever
01:23:19.32 --> 01:23:24.52 yeah and there's values that I will not compromise right there's a values that I will not compromise
01:23:24.52 --> 01:23:27.96 would that I would think that that before a very specific reason you know you know how
01:23:27.96 --> 01:23:31.08 for some people they'll be like I'm just not like that but they don't really know why like hey
01:23:31.08 --> 01:23:34.60 well I don't know maybe because my dad told me that one time when we're fishing or whatever
01:23:34.60 --> 01:23:40.52 the so there's a difference is what I'm saying so but here's the thing and I say this
01:23:40.52 --> 01:23:46.28 this is what I'll do sometime I'll be like hey you know this is more important because of you
01:23:46.28 --> 01:23:52.84 know I don't know my hell oh you're rationalized yeah you know and yeah I'll essentially
01:23:52.84 --> 01:24:01.08 like twist the truth to myself to to kind of explain to myself again how important this is you know
01:24:01.08 --> 01:24:06.12 for the team you know one of the things if that's important there's other ways to do that
01:24:06.12 --> 01:24:12.44 so so to to your point that's what I'm saying when I'm thinking about decisions I'm asking
01:24:12.44 --> 01:24:17.80 myself hey is this my ego or is this oh my doing the right thing for the rope for the team yeah
01:24:17.80 --> 01:24:21.24 because there's that's what you should be checking on right if you're doing it for yourself
01:24:22.04 --> 01:24:26.76 most 99% of the time if you're doing something for yourself that hurts the team the long term
01:24:26.76 --> 01:24:31.08 is not going to be beneficial to you okay the long term is not going to be beneficial to you
01:24:32.20 --> 01:24:37.08 because you're doing something for yourself everybody sees that you don't think they see it
01:24:37.08 --> 01:24:42.20 but they see it yeah so you try and do things that are going to benefit the team and
01:24:43.16 --> 01:24:48.44 sometimes I'm 99% of the time when you do something that benefits the team you're going to benefit
01:24:48.44 --> 01:24:53.40 from it as well but you have to see the long game because sometimes the short game it's like
01:24:53.40 --> 01:24:56.52 oh no if I do this for the team that means I'm going to miss this this weekend and that
01:24:56.52 --> 01:25:02.68 sucks well guess what in the long term when you work this weekend and cover for the other guys
01:25:02.68 --> 01:25:06.20 it couldn't make it in for whatever reason you're going to have a better relationship with them
01:25:06.20 --> 01:25:08.84 and they're going to cover for you next time it's like it's long term it's going to be good
01:25:08.84 --> 01:25:14.12 yeah but you're worried about you and that's that's a problem playing the long game again
01:25:14.12 --> 01:25:21.08 yeah always gotta play that long game next question that's way to get your team get you team in
01:25:21.08 --> 01:25:28.84 okay best way to get your team to buy in to your vision let it be their vision let the vision
01:25:28.84 --> 01:25:33.56 come from them right and the more the vision comes from them the more the plan comes from them
01:25:33.56 --> 01:25:37.48 the more they buy into it the more you force the vision and force the plan down there's throw
01:25:37.48 --> 01:25:44.36 the less buy in that you're going to get from it now you if you're super persuasive you can do a
01:25:44.36 --> 01:25:50.92 better job of coming up with a vision but why do that why not say hey guys you know what
01:25:50.92 --> 01:25:55.16 we're going to put together the direction that this team is going give me some feedback give me
01:25:55.16 --> 01:26:00.44 some bullet points hit me now they all come back with bullet points you as someone together it's
01:26:00.44 --> 01:26:07.32 okay this is what we're going to do it boom everyone's on board that easy our plan yeah
01:26:07.32 --> 01:26:13.72 so much easier with our plan and you if you're scared of that and I think if all if I give the team
01:26:13.72 --> 01:26:17.96 the opportunity come up with a plan they're going to come up with a plan that sucks well how
01:26:17.96 --> 01:26:22.20 well did you train them if they come up with a plan that sucks you haven't trained them very well
01:26:22.20 --> 01:26:25.16 most of the time if you train them decently they're going to come up with a plan that's close enough
01:26:25.16 --> 01:26:28.84 to the decent plan that they can go and execute you we can all execute it together that can be
01:26:28.84 --> 01:26:34.12 part of the vision let's go hey juggle what would be better verbal communication with
01:26:35.16 --> 01:26:41.56 concept of prioritizing ex-y when talking to my wife she oftentimes feels overwhelmed with how many
01:26:41.56 --> 01:26:47.40 decisions she has to make she hates when I use the words of prioritizing ex-y cute well the root
01:26:47.40 --> 01:26:53.16 problem there isn't that she hates the the words prioritize next you the the problem is is that
01:26:53.16 --> 01:27:00.04 you're you're telling her what to do yes that's you know instead of being like hey you know
01:27:00.04 --> 01:27:06.04 hey if you just prioritize next you there's if there's a at least a 50% chance that she doesn't
01:27:06.04 --> 01:27:10.68 even want to hear your suggestion she's just telling you because it's vent she's venting to you
01:27:11.24 --> 01:27:14.28 so for you to be like man those are a lot of decisions make that's hard
01:27:14.28 --> 01:27:20.76 if you were to say to her how do you how do you handle this because I know you're doing this
01:27:20.76 --> 01:27:25.16 every day girl I'm impressed how do you do that and then she says well you know it's hard but
01:27:25.16 --> 01:27:32.92 here's what I do so if it was just a matter of re-naming it it's like hey well call it hey
01:27:32.92 --> 01:27:37.32 you know what you need to do is grade and go or what you what you need to do is rank and roll
01:27:38.20 --> 01:27:41.80 what you need to do is triage and check off what you need to do
01:27:41.80 --> 01:27:46.76 or or designate and do that's you know there's a bunch of different ways you could phrase it but
01:27:46.76 --> 01:27:51.96 that's not what's making her responded in a negative way it's responding in a negative way because
01:27:51.96 --> 01:27:56.12 you're saying hey here's all you need to do is prioritize next you right that's a snow
01:27:57.80 --> 01:28:06.12 what she needs is some sympathy some listening allowing to vent and then you can say hey
01:28:06.12 --> 01:28:11.88 you know if you've done that properly you can say well you know I did read that book and they
01:28:11.88 --> 01:28:16.36 kind of say when there's a bunch of crazy things going on like you've got going on they say to do
01:28:16.36 --> 01:28:20.84 the same thing that I see you do which is you pick the most important one and then you kind of
01:28:20.84 --> 01:28:26.36 focus on that that's pretty cool you do that pretty well yeah you do that really well
01:28:28.12 --> 01:28:32.44 so just take a little bit of approach man yeah it's not just the words the words are not
01:28:32.44 --> 01:28:36.60 important I hate to break the news to you but the words are not pissing her off you are
01:28:37.96 --> 01:28:42.52 listen to her it seems you don't notice some people they come you and a problem they don't
01:28:42.52 --> 01:28:47.16 want a solution oh yeah it happens all the time they just want you to sit there and listen to them yeah
01:28:47.96 --> 01:28:54.28 my wife does that for sure for sure you know hey there's this problem oh why don't you do this
01:28:54.92 --> 01:28:59.80 it's not that easy okay fine yeah you just tell me more about the problem I'm still here listen
01:28:59.80 --> 01:29:06.36 don't say that by the way you're going to do that that part yeah yeah yeah yeah it's almost like
01:29:06.36 --> 01:29:12.60 when it is like it seems like they yeah that they don't mind so much the suffering of the problem
01:29:12.60 --> 01:29:16.12 suffering I'm over using that word I know but like they don't mind the suffering they just want
01:29:16.12 --> 01:29:21.40 to they don't want to suffer alone so if like oh yeah I'm having like these issues or whatever
01:29:21.40 --> 01:29:27.56 first is like hey come suffer with me sympathize empathize or whatever we can suffer together
01:29:27.56 --> 01:29:31.88 that that's that's why I'm coming to you in the first place so I can get closer to you whatever whatever
01:29:31.88 --> 01:29:35.32 I don't know that I'm totally reflecting diminished do you remember when I talked about that
01:29:35.32 --> 01:29:40.84 yes that's like a such a good tactic in this situation reflect the emotions back to them
01:29:41.72 --> 01:29:47.24 but diminish them a little bit so if they're all freaking mad about something you go oh I can't believe that
01:29:48.12 --> 01:29:52.84 but you don't be as mad as them but you don't be the hate calm down you don't you don't say yeah
01:29:52.84 --> 01:29:59.64 hey here's just just prioritize next cue oh it's a rough one actually to be honest like
01:29:59.64 --> 01:30:05.64 I felt that before where I'd come to my brothers typically the one like I've come to him with
01:30:05.64 --> 01:30:10.60 like a problem and here's the thing I didn't want like sympathy or empathy primarily but I
01:30:10.60 --> 01:30:14.20 wanted a little bit you know so you can't just roll sit there with your
01:30:15.08 --> 01:30:20.76 apple or whatever okay I think what you're gonna do is put this you know like kind of like
01:30:20.76 --> 01:30:24.92 you're so done it you get this feeling I'm not saying this you want to know why
01:30:26.20 --> 01:30:30.92 your brother or you or whoever can look at that problem and like come up with a solution
01:30:30.92 --> 01:30:35.08 it's because they're detached they're de facto detached from the problem so when you're all wrapped up in the
01:30:35.08 --> 01:30:37.88 problem you're like a head or no way to do because I got this this and this your brother's like
01:30:37.88 --> 01:30:42.20 well just do that and you're like you get mad you know well you're able to see what to do
01:30:42.20 --> 01:30:47.32 because he's on the outside yeah so if you can learn to too detach yourself you won't have to rely on
01:30:47.32 --> 01:30:51.16 getting other people to help you yeah if you can't detach and you're all wrapped up in the
01:30:51.16 --> 01:30:55.000 emotions the situation you're gonna you're gonna have to go someone to help and then when you do
01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:02.76 don't get mad at them when they just tell you the solution but but when you reverse the rules
01:31:02.76 --> 01:31:06.84 and you take ownership of trying to provide solutions you got to realize that it's your fault
01:31:06.84 --> 01:31:11.56 that your solution isn't being welcomed yeah and that's kind of the point where like I'm
01:31:11.56 --> 01:31:16.12 trying to gain an understanding you know because easy when your detachments first in his like
01:31:16.12 --> 01:31:19.64 why are you complaining about like because this is like you feel the front of your mind you're like
01:31:19.64 --> 01:31:23.48 why are you complaining about this why don't you just solve that problem and never complain about it ever again
01:31:23.48 --> 01:31:28.12 you know that's the feeling the other person have that detached person the you know in this case
01:31:28.12 --> 01:31:35.96 um the husband and whatever so what I did was I imagine my situation that I'm on the other side
01:31:35.96 --> 01:31:40.44 where I kind of like I know what it feels like to kind of want some sympathy I don't want sympathy and that's it
01:31:40.44 --> 01:31:45.64 you know but of course but I want some of it so imagine that feeling then or I imagine that feeling
01:31:45.64 --> 01:31:50.52 that I got from my brother at times when I come to him with a problem that that's bothering me or
01:31:50.52 --> 01:31:56.28 whatever and the part and the fact that it's bothering me means nothing all my end so the fact that
01:31:56.28 --> 01:32:02.04 the way he presents a solution with no empathy and sympathy almost says actually it feels like it says
01:32:03.32 --> 01:32:08.28 you're so dumb like you're dumb yeah you know like why you wrapped up about this thing you're
01:32:08.28 --> 01:32:12.12 dumb kind of thing so from a leadership perspective from his perspective he's your recognized
01:32:12.12 --> 01:32:17.08 that what he needs to do is massage your ears feel good about it be like oh man that's a hell of
01:32:17.08 --> 01:32:21.72 a problem you know one thing maybe you could do I don't know if you'd be up I don't know if I could do
01:32:21.72 --> 01:32:24.76 it but you could probably do it because you're a little bit better at this kind of thing you just
01:32:24.76 --> 01:32:30.36 don't just do that well that's a good tactic right there when you say like like what you what you
01:32:30.36 --> 01:32:35.32 kind of do kind of like you're like one of these individuals one of the rare people who knows how to
01:32:35.32 --> 01:32:38.84 deal with it and it's like with all right you know nothing that you do that I can't really do
01:32:38.84 --> 01:32:46.28 it though is you prioritize and that's it what you think of you I just get all scattered brain
01:32:46.28 --> 01:32:51.48 so focus on all kinds of different things at the same time and that's a problem yeah there you go
01:32:51.48 --> 01:32:56.84 get some next question my warrior kids want to know is where your kid number three in the works
01:32:58.44 --> 01:33:01.80 yes warrior kid three is in the works I am on chapter 10
01:33:02.84 --> 01:33:07.72 yeah and but unfortunately I've been on chapter 10 for a couple days not because it's taking
01:33:07.72 --> 01:33:12.04 me a long time to write chapter 10 but I didn't write yesterday or the day before
01:33:13.08 --> 01:33:18.92 because we were doing multiple podcasts which is a bummer but be back on the path today as a
01:33:18.92 --> 01:33:23.32 matter of fact well technically you're on the path your path is just super wide you know you
01:33:23.32 --> 01:33:27.88 had to switch lanes for a little bit you know miss you miss it exit but good you know boom you're
01:33:27.88 --> 01:33:32.28 back on on in that lane on the same path so yeah and we're looking at we're looking at spring
01:33:32.28 --> 01:33:38.44 publication for that once again getting it out there really haven't found right in this book that's
01:33:38.44 --> 01:33:43.96 the characters develop more complex some complex there's some complexities there's some situations
01:33:43.96 --> 01:33:51.48 that mark hasn't really had to deal with yet the primary being Danny Reinhart so brace yourself
01:33:51.48 --> 01:33:57.48 for the impact of Danny Reinhart brace yourself all right that's what you're life's hell is intense
01:33:57.48 --> 01:34:04.20 and intentional how do I even get started living like that let's just break this down real easy okay
01:34:04.76 --> 01:34:11.56 number one if you want to live like more focused in your life choose to decide that you're going
01:34:11.56 --> 01:34:19.000 to actually live like that do that right down whatever it is you want to do and then before you
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.76 go to bed at night right down some things that you're gonna do tomorrow they're gonna help you move
01:34:22.76 --> 01:34:28.36 towards the goals that you have and then set your alarm clock for early in the morning wake up and
01:34:28.36 --> 01:34:36.76 do the things that you wrote down stay on that path that's it yeah and do you think that you've just
01:34:36.76 --> 01:34:41.96 sort of grown accustomed to just dealing with it that way so you know the more you do it yeah
01:34:41.96 --> 01:34:46.52 absolutely so that's kind of the hard part right to get off the ground should be saying to break
01:34:46.52 --> 01:34:54.92 the gravitational pull of laziness and apathy yes yeah and of course that but I feel like that
01:34:54.92 --> 01:35:00.04 in this kind of situation like when you live how intently intense sure but you kind of always
01:35:00.04 --> 01:35:06.20 being intense but that intentional situation because it's pretty easy if you know a goal it's pretty
01:35:06.20 --> 01:35:10.28 I don't say easy but it's simple like to reach that goal is really clear you know like
01:35:11.16 --> 01:35:13.88 you're gonna have to fight through obstacles all this other stuff but if you don't really have
01:35:13.88 --> 01:35:18.76 an intentional like goal it's hard to just kind of float there and be like I need to be I don't
01:35:18.76 --> 01:35:25.08 know vaguely success what's like it's it makes the whole deal harder and it's a lot of times like
01:35:25.08 --> 01:35:30.84 a normal person would they don't have specific goals for every aspect of their life you know they'll
01:35:30.84 --> 01:35:34.68 have one in maybe with their career something like that or fitness or something like that but
01:35:34.68 --> 01:35:38.20 everything else is just sort of hey I'm leaving day by day doing the best I can't kind of think
01:35:38.20 --> 01:35:42.92 but if you can whether be right it down or whatever if you can have it in your brain consciously
01:35:42.92 --> 01:35:48.36 that or remember essentially like what these goals are it makes it a lot more clear and then the
01:35:48.36 --> 01:35:53.56 more you kind of follow those goals the more it becomes like habit like you just what I think
01:35:54.20 --> 01:36:01.48 check next question how do the finest civilian leaders differ from the finest military leaders or
01:36:01.48 --> 01:36:07.32 in other words what character traits do military leaders develop that are more difficult
01:36:07.32 --> 01:36:14.04 or rare for civilian leaders to develop there really the leadership is leadership and the
01:36:14.04 --> 01:36:18.60 good civilian leaders have the same good qualities that the good military leaders have and vice
01:36:18.60 --> 01:36:25.24 versa and life life was talking about this the other day that you know he he tells people like
01:36:25.24 --> 01:36:28.84 hey man I wish you were in the military wish you you would have been good you know you would have been
01:36:28.84 --> 01:36:32.36 a good infantry officer you would be good sealed platoon leader that would have been cool if you were in
01:36:32.36 --> 01:36:36.20 teams because you're a good leader in the civilians after you're a good leader in the you'd be a
01:36:36.20 --> 01:36:42.68 good leader in the military so there's no and now there are strengths and weaknesses for leaders in
01:36:42.68 --> 01:36:48.28 both of those situations in military leaders you take 10 military leaders there's all kinds of
01:36:48.28 --> 01:36:52.20 strength and weaknesses different between all each one of those 10 and there's all kinds of
01:36:52.20 --> 01:36:55.80 you take 10 civilian leaders and all kinds of different strengths and weaknesses amongst those 10
01:36:56.68 --> 01:37:00.12 and if you put them if you flip them back and forth it doesn't matter there's still going to be
01:37:00.12 --> 01:37:03.96 random strengths and weaknesses some guys are good at presenting things some guys are good at
01:37:03.96 --> 01:37:09.16 simplifying things some guys are good at articulating things and and those groups washed out
01:37:09.16 --> 01:37:13.48 regardless there's great military leaders that aren't very articulate but they figure out who
01:37:13.48 --> 01:37:16.60 to get done there's great civilian leaders that aren't very articulate but they figure out what
01:37:16.60 --> 01:37:21.32 there's great military leaders that are really good at simplifying things there's great
01:37:21.32 --> 01:37:24.44 civilian leaders that are good at simplethere's people that are not good at that so they find
01:37:24.44 --> 01:37:28.84 the correct solution the people that'll compliment them as leaders and move forward
01:37:28.84 --> 01:37:31.24 But no huge difference.
01:37:31.24 --> 01:37:32.68 Actually, there's no difference.
01:37:32.68 --> 01:37:35.16 There's just, there's good leadership
01:37:35.16 --> 01:37:36.16 and there's bad leadership.
01:37:36.16 --> 01:37:37.76 That's it.
01:37:37.76 --> 01:37:42.76 Hey, Jockel, love your book, Sam Podcast.
01:37:42.76 --> 01:37:45.36 When it comes down to the wire,
01:37:45.36 --> 01:37:47.44 and you need to make a quick and tactical decision
01:37:47.44 --> 01:37:50.60 and admit, amidst chaos, how do you keep your head straight?
01:37:50.60 --> 01:37:52.08 This is just everyone knows the answer
01:37:52.08 --> 01:37:53.24 to this by now, detach.
01:37:53.24 --> 01:37:55.000 Take a step back, take a step back offline,
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.16 take a step back from the tactical situation
01:37:57.16 --> 01:38:00.08 and turn your head, look around, see what's going on,
01:38:00.08 --> 01:38:02.20 assess it properly, unemotionally,
01:38:02.20 --> 01:38:03.28 and then make a decision.
01:38:03.28 --> 01:38:04.12 That's it.
01:38:04.12 --> 01:38:05.24 You gotta learn to detach.
01:38:08.68 --> 01:38:09.68 Easy money.
01:38:09.68 --> 01:38:10.52 Next question.
01:38:10.52 --> 01:38:11.68 Jockel, it's not easy.
01:38:11.68 --> 01:38:12.52 It was easy.
01:38:12.52 --> 01:38:13.68 People would ask me that question.
01:38:13.68 --> 01:38:15.28 Two months ago, it's a simple, not easy.
01:38:15.28 --> 01:38:18.32 It is simple, it is simple, but it's definitely not easy.
01:38:18.32 --> 01:38:20.28 No, it's not, and I'll tell you,
01:38:20.28 --> 01:38:24.56 it's not only not easy, it's almost so hard
01:38:24.56 --> 01:38:27.64 that you don't even see it happening.
01:38:27.64 --> 01:38:29.08 It's like you're blind to it.
01:38:29.08 --> 01:38:30.36 Most people are blind to it.
01:38:30.36 --> 01:38:32.04 That's why it's such a huge advantage
01:38:32.04 --> 01:38:33.36 from a leadership perspective.
01:38:33.36 --> 01:38:37.32 You can be one inch above everyone else.
01:38:37.32 --> 01:38:40.20 You can see infinitely further than they can,
01:38:40.20 --> 01:38:42.24 because let's face it.
01:38:42.24 --> 01:38:46.76 They have a limited, when you're at one level,
01:38:46.76 --> 01:38:51.76 when you're at six feet, you can see what you can see.
01:38:51.76 --> 01:38:53.92 You go to eight feet, you can see things
01:38:53.92 --> 01:38:55.40 that they can't see.
01:38:55.40 --> 01:38:57.96 They literally can't see them.
01:38:57.96 --> 01:39:00.88 So therefore, you know things that they don't know.
01:39:00.88 --> 01:39:02.16 And all of a sudden, you seem brilliant,
01:39:02.16 --> 01:39:03.28 because you can literally see things
01:39:03.28 --> 01:39:05.24 that they literally can't see.
01:39:05.24 --> 01:39:07.28 So take a step back, turn your head,
01:39:07.28 --> 01:39:10.20 look around, detach from your emotions,
01:39:10.20 --> 01:39:12.44 detach from the chaos, that's it.
01:39:12.44 --> 01:39:17.44 And the emotions, that's like one of the major things
01:39:17.56 --> 01:39:19.08 that's making you blind.
01:39:19.08 --> 01:39:19.92 The first one?
01:39:21.28 --> 01:39:22.96 Yeah, whether it's emotions,
01:39:22.96 --> 01:39:25.12 whether it's anger, whether it's frustration,
01:39:25.12 --> 01:39:29.56 whether it's panic, whether it's stress,
01:39:29.56 --> 01:39:31.72 all those emotions will have the same result
01:39:31.72 --> 01:39:33.76 on you and your decision making,
01:39:33.76 --> 01:39:35.72 which is you won't see what's actually happening.
01:39:37.92 --> 01:39:40.36 Jalko, how do you build a relationship
01:39:40.36 --> 01:39:44.72 with a boss that consistently loses his temper
01:39:44.72 --> 01:39:45.76 on a regular basis?
01:39:46.84 --> 01:39:50.80 Stay calm, don't overreact, let them vent to you.
01:39:50.80 --> 01:39:55.16 And don't make a big deal out of them losing their temper.
01:39:55.16 --> 01:39:57.60 Just be like, just absorb it and be like,
01:39:57.60 --> 01:40:01.32 hey, it's all good boss, let them vent.
01:40:01.32 --> 01:40:03.24 And then when they calm down a little bit,
01:40:03.24 --> 01:40:06.20 just don't even go like, man, I'm glad you calm down.
01:40:06.20 --> 01:40:08.72 No, just be like, you know, say,
01:40:08.72 --> 01:40:11.28 okay, hey, here's where we're at with this decision.
01:40:11.28 --> 01:40:13.08 I'm gonna bring this to the troops or whatever,
01:40:13.08 --> 01:40:14.60 just be calm.
01:40:14.60 --> 01:40:17.24 And then eventually, hopefully,
01:40:17.24 --> 01:40:18.76 you get a relationship that's strong enough
01:40:18.76 --> 01:40:21.32 so you can actually say something to them, like,
01:40:21.32 --> 01:40:23.08 hey, man, you know, I know you,
01:40:23.08 --> 01:40:25.76 I know things drive you crazy, but, you know,
01:40:25.76 --> 01:40:29.88 it's always a lot better when you're just kind of calm.
01:40:29.88 --> 01:40:32.88 And everyone kind of has a lot of respect for that, you know?
01:40:32.88 --> 01:40:34.32 But again, that's when you gotta be careful with
01:40:34.32 --> 01:40:35.88 because they might just go, what are you talking about?
01:40:35.88 --> 01:40:37.20 You don't know about respect, they might have to say.
01:40:37.20 --> 01:40:39.000 They might have to say, right there.
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.72 So yeah, I'm just gonna be calm, not overreact,
01:40:41.72 --> 01:40:43.52 absorb that kind of thing.
01:40:44.88 --> 01:40:46.20 Next question.
01:40:46.20 --> 01:40:47.76 I'm struggling to be an effective leader
01:40:47.76 --> 01:40:50.84 because I'm told that I don't have the right tone.
01:40:52.08 --> 01:40:54.000 I'm too direct in course.
01:40:54.96 --> 01:40:56.28 And I'm not too sure how to fix it.
01:40:56.28 --> 01:40:57.60 I'd appreciate any of it.
01:40:57.60 --> 01:40:58.92 And all help, thanks a lot.
01:40:58.92 --> 01:41:02.000 If you can record yourself while you're talking to people,
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.88 like when you're on the phone with someone,
01:41:03.88 --> 01:41:08.24 just record to take out your cell phone and record
01:41:08.24 --> 01:41:09.36 and see what you sound like.
01:41:09.36 --> 01:41:11.80 Because you might be surprised at what you sound like.
01:41:11.80 --> 01:41:14.80 A lot of times people don't realize what they sound like.
01:41:14.80 --> 01:41:17.12 You might have to overcompensate for a little while
01:41:17.12 --> 01:41:19.96 and be overly pleasant and nice to people,
01:41:19.96 --> 01:41:22.76 which to them might sound like normal,
01:41:22.76 --> 01:41:25.44 but to you, it'll sound like you're being just totally
01:41:25.44 --> 01:41:29.60 over the top nice because you're like, how are you today?
01:41:31.08 --> 01:41:32.64 And they're thinking, oh, that's nice.
01:41:32.64 --> 01:41:34.32 These actually have an accommodation with me.
01:41:34.32 --> 01:41:35.12 And in your mind, you're like,
01:41:35.12 --> 01:41:36.52 these are just pleasant trees.
01:41:36.52 --> 01:41:38.40 I don't think I should be, you know, it's like, no,
01:41:38.40 --> 01:41:39.64 just calm down.
01:41:39.64 --> 01:41:40.88 It's actually great feedback.
01:41:40.88 --> 01:41:43.36 It's awesome that people have actually told you
01:41:43.36 --> 01:41:46.000 that you are too direct and too course.
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:46.88 So what does that mean?
01:41:46.88 --> 01:41:48.04 You're offending people.
01:41:48.04 --> 01:41:49.60 If you're offending people, do they listen to you?
01:41:49.60 --> 01:41:50.96 The answer is no.
01:41:50.96 --> 01:41:52.48 So how do you not offend people?
01:41:52.48 --> 01:41:54.96 And in your mind, you're thinking,
01:41:54.96 --> 01:41:56.60 hey, this is the way I am.
01:41:56.60 --> 01:41:58.04 You know, I'll just want to these people that's direct.
01:41:58.04 --> 01:42:00.04 You don't, you know, I just put the word out.
01:42:00.04 --> 01:42:02.88 And it's like, no, actually all you do is piss people off
01:42:02.88 --> 01:42:04.76 offend them and now they don't listen to you.
01:42:04.76 --> 01:42:06.68 So don't be that person.
01:42:06.68 --> 01:42:07.88 Let's try and build relationships.
01:42:07.88 --> 01:42:09.60 Make that your key goal, make your goal,
01:42:09.60 --> 01:42:11.64 not to get the your point across to them,
01:42:11.64 --> 01:42:13.32 but to build a relationship with them.
01:42:13.32 --> 01:42:14.96 Make that your goal.
01:42:14.96 --> 01:42:17.08 And then the rest of it will start to come together.
01:42:17.08 --> 01:42:18.60 Get you moving in the right direction.
01:42:18.60 --> 01:42:19.92 Yeah.
01:42:19.92 --> 01:42:22.12 And sometimes,
01:42:22.12 --> 01:42:24.32 do not say this person is like this,
01:42:24.32 --> 01:42:27.88 but sometimes people who are direct and course
01:42:27.88 --> 01:42:29.24 like they sort of take pride in it,
01:42:29.24 --> 01:42:33.12 and also, so if you can search your mind and be like,
01:42:33.12 --> 01:42:35.64 hey, am I taking pride in this a little bit?
01:42:35.64 --> 01:42:39.08 Know that you're going full speed in the wrong direction.
01:42:39.08 --> 01:42:39.92 That's right.
01:42:39.92 --> 01:42:42.72 With that, you know, if that's the case,
01:42:42.72 --> 01:42:43.72 that makes you a lot easier.
01:42:43.72 --> 01:42:45.04 Here you go. Yep.
01:42:45.04 --> 01:42:45.84 Affirmative.
01:42:45.84 --> 01:42:47.16 Next question.
01:42:47.16 --> 01:42:50.48 I serve in the Coast Guard and operate in high risk
01:42:50.48 --> 01:42:54.20 surface operations where not only do I have victims
01:42:54.20 --> 01:42:56.08 in the water who gave a high risk,
01:42:56.08 --> 01:42:58.16 who have a high risk of dying,
01:42:58.16 --> 01:43:00.48 but also my people and myself have a high
01:43:00.48 --> 01:43:03.000 probabilities of being injured or killed.
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.12 I enjoy my job thoroughly and perform on the job,
01:43:05.12 --> 01:43:08.84 but it's the waiting that's brutal.
01:43:08.84 --> 01:43:12.12 How do you manage stress, it stress in the off time.
01:43:12.12 --> 01:43:14.76 So it's not overwhelming.
01:43:14.76 --> 01:43:16.000 Look, you've got a train hard,
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.52 you've got to be prepared, you've got to rehearse,
01:43:17.52 --> 01:43:18.92 you've got to drill worst case scenarios,
01:43:18.92 --> 01:43:21.04 you've got to be an awesome physical condition,
01:43:21.04 --> 01:43:22.92 you've got to do all those things.
01:43:24.20 --> 01:43:26.36 You prepare as much as you can.
01:43:27.36 --> 01:43:29.92 You can't worry about things that you can't control.
01:43:29.92 --> 01:43:31.08 So the things that you can't control,
01:43:31.08 --> 01:43:31.92 what can you control?
01:43:31.92 --> 01:43:33.000 You can be in good physical shape,
01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000 you can prepare for your equipment,
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.92 make sure you know how to operate your equipment,
01:43:36.92 --> 01:43:38.40 you can drill worst case scenarios,
01:43:38.40 --> 01:43:40.40 so make sure your team understands the procedures
01:43:40.40 --> 01:43:41.76 that you're supposed to do.
01:43:41.76 --> 01:43:43.44 So you take control of all the things
01:43:43.44 --> 01:43:47.32 that you can control, you do those to the end degree,
01:43:47.32 --> 01:43:49.32 the things that you can't control,
01:43:49.32 --> 01:43:51.76 you just gotta not worry about them
01:43:51.76 --> 01:43:53.56 because that's what's,
01:43:53.56 --> 01:43:55.88 you're actually less prepared
01:43:55.88 --> 01:43:57.000 because you're worrying about other things.
01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.60 You can't sleep because there's a storm coming
01:43:58.60 --> 01:44:00.12 and you know that there's gonna be some rescues.
01:44:00.12 --> 01:44:02.48 It's like, hey, you've prepared, you've trained,
01:44:02.48 --> 01:44:03.76 you've got your equipment already,
01:44:03.76 --> 01:44:05.96 you've rehearsed with your teammates,
01:44:05.96 --> 01:44:07.88 like that's what we do.
01:44:07.88 --> 01:44:09.92 And there's some things that I can't control,
01:44:09.92 --> 01:44:11.40 and I'm okay with that.
01:44:11.40 --> 01:44:16.40 And not to get too crazy, but like worst case scenario,
01:44:16.48 --> 01:44:19.72 and not to get too like dark worst case scenario,
01:44:19.72 --> 01:44:20.60 what happens?
01:44:21.64 --> 01:44:23.96 Worst case scenario, what happens?
01:44:23.96 --> 01:44:25.36 You die.
01:44:25.36 --> 01:44:27.44 That's the worst case scenario that happens.
01:44:28.80 --> 01:44:29.64 Okay.
01:44:31.96 --> 01:44:35.72 Okay, so you've got your insurance taken care of,
01:44:35.72 --> 01:44:38.32 you've got your SGLI set up,
01:44:38.32 --> 01:44:41.76 you've written letters to your family
01:44:41.76 --> 01:44:44.000 to tell them what to do,
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.96 and that you've had a great job
01:44:45.96 --> 01:44:47.64 and that you loved what you're doing, what you're doing,
01:44:47.64 --> 01:44:51.88 and that's the way it goes.
01:44:51.88 --> 01:44:56.04 You know, part of life is death, 100%.
01:44:56.04 --> 01:44:57.84 Think about that, 100%.
01:44:58.92 --> 01:45:03.92 So if you can compartmentalize the things that you can control
01:45:05.20 --> 01:45:06.80 and say, okay, these are things I've got control of,
01:45:06.80 --> 01:45:08.16 and then you look at the worst case scenario,
01:45:08.16 --> 01:45:09.84 which is the worst case scenario,
01:45:09.84 --> 01:45:11.28 I mean, I guess the worst case scenario is like,
01:45:11.28 --> 01:45:14.08 hey, if you could one of your teammates,
01:45:14.08 --> 01:45:18.44 you know, dies, that seems to me to always be the worst thing,
01:45:18.44 --> 01:45:19.28 or you die.
01:45:19.28 --> 01:45:20.96 What are you gonna do?
01:45:20.96 --> 01:45:23.28 So to prevent my teammate from dying,
01:45:23.28 --> 01:45:27.12 I'm gonna train, prepare, do everything I can to my power,
01:45:27.12 --> 01:45:29.12 and one of the things in my power to do
01:45:29.12 --> 01:45:31.56 is to not be scared of things that I can't control,
01:45:31.56 --> 01:45:33.88 or not worry about things that I can't control.
01:45:33.88 --> 01:45:38.88 And then like, hey, I could die doing this job.
01:45:39.76 --> 01:45:41.000 That could happen.
01:45:42.40 --> 01:45:43.60 What do you do about that?
01:45:43.60 --> 01:45:44.80 You prepare for it.
01:45:44.80 --> 01:45:47.000 You write your will, you make sure that,
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.04 your W, your W2, or page two,
01:45:49.04 --> 01:45:50.28 I believe it's called your page two,
01:45:50.28 --> 01:45:52.000 and the military service records,
01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.84 so that they know what to do with your finances.
01:45:54.84 --> 01:45:57.56 You fill out your SGLI form,
01:45:57.56 --> 01:46:00.32 you write a letter to your friends and family.
01:46:01.44 --> 01:46:02.40 That's what you do.
01:46:02.40 --> 01:46:05.96 And then you go out and you do your job.
01:46:05.96 --> 01:46:10.24 The fear, the fear of death
01:46:12.24 --> 01:46:16.40 that you have in your mind is more likely to cause a problem.
01:46:16.40 --> 01:46:19.92 If you're afraid of death, you're more likely to die,
01:46:19.92 --> 01:46:22.40 than if you say, you know what, if this happens,
01:46:22.40 --> 01:46:24.68 God forbid, guess what?
01:46:24.68 --> 01:46:27.20 I'm living the life I wanna live,
01:46:27.20 --> 01:46:29.52 and I'm gonna die doing this.
01:46:29.52 --> 01:46:33.32 It's like that, if you can get over that hurdle right there,
01:46:33.32 --> 01:46:35.000 that's a huge thing.
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.08 And the more comfortable you are with that,
01:46:38.08 --> 01:46:40.40 the less chance of you actually dying,
01:46:40.40 --> 01:46:42.04 there is because you won't be scared of it.
01:46:42.04 --> 01:46:44.08 You won't be hesitant, you won't be paranoid,
01:46:44.08 --> 01:46:47.84 you won't lose sleep, you'll be like, okay.
01:46:47.84 --> 01:46:50.04 So just truly think about it.
01:46:50.04 --> 01:46:53.52 Like, man, you're doing an important job,
01:46:53.52 --> 01:46:55.36 you're gonna try and save people's lives,
01:46:55.36 --> 01:46:56.84 there's inherent risk in that,
01:46:56.84 --> 01:46:59.24 but it's what you wanna do, is what you chose to do,
01:46:59.24 --> 01:47:01.76 there's, you deal with that.
01:47:01.76 --> 01:47:05.04 And if you can get through that, that's a huge step.
01:47:05.04 --> 01:47:06.08 Does this mean you wanna die?
01:47:06.08 --> 01:47:07.36 No, it doesn't mean that at all.
01:47:07.36 --> 01:47:09.56 It doesn't mean that at all.
01:47:09.56 --> 01:47:11.36 It doesn't mean that at all.
01:47:11.36 --> 01:47:14.08 But if you're like, you know what, I could die.
01:47:14.08 --> 01:47:15.84 That's one of the possible outcomes here.
01:47:15.84 --> 01:47:19.24 It's highly unlikely, but it is a possible outcome.
01:47:19.24 --> 01:47:24.24 If it happens, I've lived the best possible way I can.
01:47:24.24 --> 01:47:27.76 I've prepared for my family, friends,
01:47:27.76 --> 01:47:29.96 to be taken care of to understand what happened,
01:47:29.96 --> 01:47:31.28 and I'm okay with that.
01:47:32.32 --> 01:47:33.96 That's my recommendation.
01:47:37.88 --> 01:47:38.72 Makes sense.
01:47:41.24 --> 01:47:43.68 Jocca, I'm very goal oriented.
01:47:45.56 --> 01:47:46.72 I'm very goal oriented.
01:47:46.72 --> 01:47:49.28 My friends say that they want me to achieve this
01:47:49.28 --> 01:47:51.44 and that yet they still are vaping,
01:47:51.44 --> 01:47:54.52 parting, being lazy and overall don't walk the talk.
01:47:54.52 --> 01:47:58.76 I wanna be an AF special tactics.
01:47:58.76 --> 01:47:59.76 Air Force.
01:47:59.76 --> 01:48:01.36 Air Force special tactics officer,
01:48:01.36 --> 01:48:03.56 and I don't have time for those destruction.
01:48:04.76 --> 01:48:05.92 How do I get to Monttrak?
01:48:05.92 --> 01:48:08.24 Well, this is pretty straightforward one for me.
01:48:08.24 --> 01:48:13.24 What I do is I walk the walk and keep walking.
01:48:15.24 --> 01:48:18.44 And if these guys want to walk the walk with me, cool.
01:48:18.44 --> 01:48:22.84 But if they want to vape and party and be lazy,
01:48:22.84 --> 01:48:25.80 those aren't the kind of guys you want around
01:48:25.80 --> 01:48:28.60 with your team anyways.
01:48:28.60 --> 01:48:32.88 So unless they get on the path that leads to the right place,
01:48:32.88 --> 01:48:34.32 I mean, you can tell them, hey man,
01:48:34.32 --> 01:48:37.36 this isn't gonna get you there, but don't spend a bunch
01:48:37.36 --> 01:48:39.000 of time trying to pick up and drag people
01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.92 that don't wanna drag themselves.
01:48:40.92 --> 01:48:42.68 Not that you go into an organization
01:48:42.68 --> 01:48:45.24 like a special tactics in the Air Force.
01:48:45.24 --> 01:48:46.76 You don't wanna be caring other people.
01:48:46.76 --> 01:48:49.52 You don't have to motivate other people.
01:48:49.52 --> 01:48:53.28 You want people that wanna do the job themselves.
01:48:53.28 --> 01:48:56.88 So don't spend a bunch of time with these people
01:48:56.88 --> 01:48:58.76 that don't wanna get after it.
01:49:01.40 --> 01:49:02.24 Makes sense.
01:49:03.44 --> 01:49:05.64 Jockel, when things start moving fast
01:49:05.64 --> 01:49:08.52 and feel out of control because you're really getting after it.
01:49:08.52 --> 01:49:11.76 Work, family, duty to encounter this other things.
01:49:11.76 --> 01:49:16.12 How do you slow it down and get the feeling back
01:49:16.12 --> 01:49:17.52 of being in control?
01:49:17.52 --> 01:49:20.20 What you do in this situation is go harder.
01:49:20.20 --> 01:49:21.04 You go harder.
01:49:21.04 --> 01:49:23.04 What you do is, and this is, think of it like this.
01:49:23.04 --> 01:49:24.92 Think of it as a sprint.
01:49:24.92 --> 01:49:27.24 You get in bogged down, there's a bunch of stuff going on.
01:49:27.24 --> 01:49:31.92 Grab a hold of a bunch of them and sprint and get caught up.
01:49:31.92 --> 01:49:32.80 That's what you do.
01:49:32.80 --> 01:49:34.32 You sprint, you get caught up.
01:49:36.40 --> 01:49:38.60 I do that kind of right now.
01:49:38.60 --> 01:49:40.12 And I didn't start doing that.
01:49:40.12 --> 01:49:42.40 I really started having to do these little sprints
01:49:42.40 --> 01:49:44.40 that I do sometimes now.
01:49:44.40 --> 01:49:46.72 Like maybe a year ago.
01:49:46.72 --> 01:49:50.64 Where I just have to just buckle down for three days
01:49:50.64 --> 01:49:52.08 and do nothing but work.
01:49:52.08 --> 01:49:53.40 Just that's it.
01:49:53.40 --> 01:49:55.04 Nothing but work.
01:49:55.04 --> 01:49:57.32 I mean, the middle of one right now,
01:49:58.32 --> 01:50:00.40 just what I did over the last few days
01:50:00.40 --> 01:50:03.16 is like, like, work, work and more work.
01:50:03.16 --> 01:50:05.48 So it's a sprint.
01:50:05.48 --> 01:50:08.52 But then you get caught up, you get things under control.
01:50:08.52 --> 01:50:11.48 And then you can go back to a more sustainable pace
01:50:11.48 --> 01:50:12.96 because you can't sprint forever.
01:50:12.96 --> 01:50:15.72 Mm. You cannot sprint forever,
01:50:15.72 --> 01:50:17.64 factually, right?
01:50:17.64 --> 01:50:18.88 That doesn't work.
01:50:18.88 --> 01:50:23.12 So if you think you're going to run along side of vehicle
01:50:24.12 --> 01:50:26.08 because you can sprint, that's not going to work.
01:50:26.08 --> 01:50:27.64 Eventually the vehicle's going to outpace you
01:50:27.64 --> 01:50:29.32 and you're going to be left behind.
01:50:29.32 --> 01:50:32.56 So you have to choose a race that you can win.
01:50:32.56 --> 01:50:36.48 But sometimes, just like in a running race,
01:50:36.48 --> 01:50:39.28 you've got a sprint to get ahead.
01:50:39.28 --> 01:50:41.40 And then once you get ahead, you can, you know,
01:50:41.40 --> 01:50:45.36 you can fall, you can go back to a sustainable pace.
01:50:45.36 --> 01:50:46.92 But that's, that's what I do.
01:50:46.92 --> 01:50:49.84 I go into like a little period of mass production.
01:50:49.84 --> 01:50:52.08 I prefer slow and steady.
01:50:52.08 --> 01:50:53.08 Absolutely.
01:50:53.08 --> 01:50:57.24 I prefer just to keep on the disciplined path
01:50:57.24 --> 01:51:00.84 every day doing what needs to be done.
01:51:00.84 --> 01:51:04.16 You know, that we talked about plant and a tree earlier.
01:51:04.16 --> 01:51:06.36 Like writing a book, nothing feels better,
01:51:06.36 --> 01:51:08.32 writing a book than when you look up
01:51:08.32 --> 01:51:12.48 after a month of writing and you got 30,000 words.
01:51:12.48 --> 01:51:14.72 Because you go to 1,000 words a day.
01:51:14.72 --> 01:51:19.12 To sit down and write 30,000 words is a gut chest.
01:51:19.12 --> 01:51:20.44 It's a gut check.
01:51:20.44 --> 01:51:21.84 For me, it is.
01:51:21.84 --> 01:51:26.56 Because I don't enjoy doing that for long periods of time.
01:51:26.56 --> 01:51:28.16 I don't enjoy sitting there typing
01:51:28.16 --> 01:51:30.56 because the boards are already pretty much in my head.
01:51:30.56 --> 01:51:33.000 So it's just a manual labor.
01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.84 But it's not manual labor where you get to move rocks.
01:51:35.84 --> 01:51:38.20 It's a manual labor of pecking into a keyboard.
01:51:38.20 --> 01:51:39.68 That's not fun for me.
01:51:39.68 --> 01:51:43.44 There's no, there's zero physical benefit.
01:51:43.44 --> 01:51:46.16 But to look up after a month and say,
01:51:46.16 --> 01:51:47.44 I got 30,000 words.
01:51:47.44 --> 01:51:50.80 That's almost a book, right?
01:51:50.80 --> 01:51:53.88 So I prefer to do that.
01:51:53.88 --> 01:51:58.92 But sometimes because I've saddleed myself
01:51:58.92 --> 01:52:01.56 with many different things going on right now,
01:52:01.56 --> 01:52:04.28 sometimes I get behind and I have to sprint.
01:52:04.28 --> 01:52:05.88 I have to just say, okay, you know what?
01:52:05.88 --> 01:52:07.44 This is gonna suck for three days,
01:52:07.44 --> 01:52:09.28 but I'm gonna get back on track.
01:52:09.28 --> 01:52:10.28 And here we go.
01:52:10.28 --> 01:52:11.12 So that's what I do.
01:52:11.12 --> 01:52:12.40 When I start feeling like all the things
01:52:12.40 --> 01:52:13.48 are kind of getting hang of me,
01:52:13.48 --> 01:52:16.20 like, hey man, maybe you have to,
01:52:16.20 --> 01:52:17.64 for work, you have to sacrifice
01:52:17.64 --> 01:52:21.000 your jitsu for whatever, two days.
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.36 You're like, yep, I'm not gonna train.
01:52:22.36 --> 01:52:25.48 But that's gonna save me a total of five hours
01:52:25.48 --> 01:52:27.08 in the next couple days and I can get a lot of work
01:52:27.08 --> 01:52:28.44 done in five hours.
01:52:28.44 --> 01:52:30.64 I didn't do jitsu yesterday.
01:52:32.48 --> 01:52:33.44 Did I want to?
01:52:33.44 --> 01:52:35.000 Yes, I did.
01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.20 But I said, okay, I'm gonna sprint right now.
01:52:37.20 --> 01:52:39.04 I gotta get this other stuff done
01:52:39.04 --> 01:52:40.76 and I had to prioritize.
01:52:40.76 --> 01:52:42.52 So that's what you have to do.
01:52:42.52 --> 01:52:44.44 And guess what, you know, then you could
01:52:44.44 --> 01:52:46.52 through that sprint, I can go back to your sustainable thing,
01:52:46.52 --> 01:52:47.96 which is jitsu every day.
01:52:47.96 --> 01:52:49.56 Just work out every day, which is,
01:52:49.56 --> 01:52:51.80 you know, write your right every day,
01:52:51.80 --> 01:52:52.80 do your work every day.
01:52:53.84 --> 01:52:55.68 So try that, try just buckling out,
01:52:55.68 --> 01:53:00.52 tell your family, tell your jitsu instructor,
01:53:00.52 --> 01:53:02.84 be like, hey, listen, I'm gonna be gone for three days.
01:53:02.84 --> 01:53:05.24 I gotta get caught up.
01:53:05.24 --> 01:53:06.84 So stand by.
01:53:06.84 --> 01:53:09.44 And boom, tell your family, look, hey,
01:53:09.44 --> 01:53:11.08 I'm sorry for the next three days.
01:53:12.12 --> 01:53:13.36 You're not gonna hear much from me.
01:53:13.36 --> 01:53:14.60 As I always stay at work late,
01:53:14.60 --> 01:53:17.24 I'm gonna get a bunch of stuff done and just sprint hard
01:53:17.24 --> 01:53:18.52 and give them a little reward at the end.
01:53:18.52 --> 01:53:20.68 Hey, when I get back on Tuesday or when I get back on the
01:53:20.68 --> 01:53:22.000 Friday, we're gonna go out for dinner, we're gonna have a
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.20 good time.
01:53:23.20 --> 01:53:24.88 But I gotta sprint, gotta get caught up.
01:53:24.88 --> 01:53:26.04 So there you go.
01:53:26.04 --> 01:53:27.24 That's the much of procedure.
01:53:27.24 --> 01:53:28.24 Good little tactic.
01:53:28.24 --> 01:53:29.24 Yeah, it is a good tactic.
01:53:29.24 --> 01:53:31.96 Oh, little reward, do you like that?
01:53:31.96 --> 01:53:33.32 Well, the whole deal, both of them
01:53:33.32 --> 01:53:35.68 like basically to make sure that you communicate
01:53:35.68 --> 01:53:38.20 with all these people that might be affected by your thing.
01:53:38.20 --> 01:53:40.36 Even like in small ways, like I say, hey, I'm gonna sprint
01:53:40.36 --> 01:53:44.96 right now, you'd be, oh, I'm sometimes surprised
01:53:44.96 --> 01:53:48.12 and how that just that little thing is so effective.
01:53:48.12 --> 01:53:51.36 Like, you know, I don't know, I'm gonna go to Jesus too.
01:53:51.36 --> 01:53:53.48 At, you know, a weird different time
01:53:53.48 --> 01:53:55.92 that may be my family sort of depending on me,
01:53:55.92 --> 01:53:57.20 not in a big way, but just a little bit
01:53:57.20 --> 01:53:58.56 depending on me being there.
01:53:58.56 --> 01:54:00.32 And I'm gonna go to Jesus instead.
01:54:00.32 --> 01:54:02.76 If I say, one week before I do that,
01:54:02.76 --> 01:54:05.80 I have to say, hey, on this day, you know, like,
01:54:05.80 --> 01:54:08.16 I understand, hey, usually I'm here, I dig it,
01:54:08.16 --> 01:54:10.24 but I'm gonna go this day, this training just kind of
01:54:10.24 --> 01:54:12.32 means a lot to me this day and time, whatever.
01:54:12.32 --> 01:54:13.16 A week before.
01:54:13.16 --> 01:54:14.56 Heads up, they love it.
01:54:14.56 --> 01:54:16.04 Love night and day.
01:54:16.04 --> 01:54:20.28 Try do it the hour before versus the week before night and day.
01:54:20.28 --> 01:54:23.28 One situation is like, yes, oh, we got your back.
01:54:23.28 --> 01:54:24.32 We'll do it.
01:54:24.32 --> 01:54:26.32 And the other one is like,
01:54:26.32 --> 01:54:26.56 yeah,
01:54:26.56 --> 01:54:27.48 distinct.
01:54:27.48 --> 01:54:30.24 Guess what my wife thinks.
01:54:30.24 --> 01:54:32.52 She thinks I'm going to do it to every day and I am.
01:54:32.52 --> 01:54:34.000 Yeah, but just like so.
01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.48 I'm just trying to surprise him to her.
01:54:36.48 --> 01:54:38.44 If I'm ever like, oh, you know,
01:54:38.44 --> 01:54:39.48 she'll be like, oh, what?
01:54:39.48 --> 01:54:40.96 You didn't leave yet?
01:54:40.96 --> 01:54:42.40 Yeah, I'm like, no, I'm actually working.
01:54:42.40 --> 01:54:44.40 She'll be like, oh, okay, that's what she realized.
01:54:44.40 --> 01:54:46.24 I got some work to do.
01:54:46.24 --> 01:54:48.000 Man, that's a good, that's good.
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.16 To remember it, you know, because you,
01:54:50.16 --> 01:54:51.76 it's easy to get caught up in like, hey,
01:54:51.76 --> 01:54:53.76 this is me and my sprint.
01:54:53.76 --> 01:54:56.12 I'm the one gonna have to buckle down, you know,
01:54:56.12 --> 01:54:56.96 sort of thing.
01:54:56.96 --> 01:54:59.72 So it kind of maybe gets in the way of you thinking,
01:54:59.72 --> 01:55:01.88 like, hey, it's for other people too, you know,
01:55:01.88 --> 01:55:04.44 I'm saying, and then that, that additional one words,
01:55:04.44 --> 01:55:06.32 like, yeah, when I'm done, you got another reward.
01:55:06.32 --> 01:55:08.72 Cause then if you communicate, they don't need the reward.
01:55:08.72 --> 01:55:10.16 I mean, you know, depends on who it is,
01:55:10.16 --> 01:55:13.92 but typically it would, it would make sense for them
01:55:13.92 --> 01:55:15.68 not to need the reward because we're all good.
01:55:15.68 --> 01:55:16.88 Good words scenario.
01:55:16.88 --> 01:55:19.000 You think, don't do it too much.
01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.52 They expect it.
01:55:20.52 --> 01:55:22.16 But that's a good to, I think.
01:55:22.16 --> 01:55:23.000 That's good.
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.96 I'm gonna put down into rotation.
01:55:25.96 --> 01:55:27.44 Next question, hey, Jocco,
01:55:27.44 --> 01:55:28.76 a lot of respect for you in your work.
01:55:28.76 --> 01:55:29.48 I have a question.
01:55:29.48 --> 01:55:32.64 How do you draw the line between doing things
01:55:32.64 --> 01:55:36.20 you're uncomfortable with to develop
01:55:36.20 --> 01:55:38.64 and just torturing yourself unnecessarily?
01:55:39.88 --> 01:55:41.92 It's pretty straightforward question, actually.
01:55:41.92 --> 01:55:43.20 And a pretty straightforward answer.
01:55:43.20 --> 01:55:44.72 Does it benefit you or not?
01:55:46.28 --> 01:55:47.56 Does it benefit you?
01:55:47.56 --> 01:55:51.56 And there is some level of torture that benefits you
01:55:51.56 --> 01:55:55.76 because it just keeps you mentally and physically tougher.
01:55:55.76 --> 01:56:00.76 So there is benefit to some level of torture, right?
01:56:01.64 --> 01:56:05.64 There's also a level of torture that is not beneficial
01:56:05.64 --> 01:56:07.96 for you actually it takes you backwards.
01:56:07.96 --> 01:56:10.44 And it's gonna injure you, it's gonna break you down.
01:56:10.44 --> 01:56:11.60 It's gonna break you down mentally,
01:56:11.60 --> 01:56:13.000 it's gonna break you down physically.
01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.48 There's times, like I've talked about this,
01:56:14.48 --> 01:56:16.56 like there's times when I've gotten on a plane,
01:56:16.56 --> 01:56:18.04 where I get on a plane, this is when I know
01:56:18.04 --> 01:56:21.24 I'm just done training, which is I get on a plane
01:56:21.24 --> 01:56:22.68 and I, because normally on a plane,
01:56:22.68 --> 01:56:25.72 I can like really hammer out some work.
01:56:25.72 --> 01:56:27.48 I can get a podcast, I can read a book,
01:56:27.48 --> 01:56:29.80 I can just really go hard because there's no,
01:56:29.80 --> 01:56:34.04 I don't sign up for Wi-Fi on the planes, I just do work.
01:56:34.04 --> 01:56:37.60 And when I get on a plane and I'm just like,
01:56:37.60 --> 01:56:41.04 oh, I'm gonna watch him, I'm gonna go into this thing
01:56:41.04 --> 01:56:43.000 and watch, and remember the last time I did
01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:47.20 I watched Zoolander, which is a funny movie,
01:56:47.20 --> 01:56:51.80 but there's zero positive benefit to my humanity
01:56:51.80 --> 01:56:53.68 by watching Zoolander.
01:56:53.68 --> 01:56:56.32 But that's it.
01:56:56.32 --> 01:56:59.88 So I just like, okay, mentally,
01:56:59.88 --> 01:57:01.48 just need to damn break.
01:57:01.48 --> 01:57:02.80 You know?
01:57:02.80 --> 01:57:04.76 And same thing with physical,
01:57:04.76 --> 01:57:06.36 like there's times where you're physically,
01:57:06.36 --> 01:57:09.92 like there's times, this is an interesting one.
01:57:09.92 --> 01:57:11.36 When you're training, you get to,
01:57:11.36 --> 01:57:14.32 if I have an injury that's recovering,
01:57:14.32 --> 01:57:18.64 and let's say normally I do eight rounds, 10 rounds.
01:57:18.64 --> 01:57:20.52 When I have an injury that's recovering,
01:57:20.52 --> 01:57:23.72 I have to have the discipline to say,
01:57:23.72 --> 01:57:26.76 you know what, I'm only doing four rounds today,
01:57:26.76 --> 01:57:29.52 because when you get to the fifth, six round,
01:57:29.52 --> 01:57:32.72 I'm tired, I'm making mistakes, seven, day,
01:57:32.72 --> 01:57:35.28 through, now I'm actually gonna get injured again.
01:57:35.28 --> 01:57:37.48 So I wanna recover from the injury,
01:57:37.48 --> 01:57:42.48 so I take some, I have to have the discipline to say no.
01:57:42.48 --> 01:57:44.72 Because the lack of discipline says,
01:57:44.72 --> 01:57:47.40 I'm just gonna train more, I'm just gonna train harder.
01:57:47.40 --> 01:57:49.20 And sometimes you have to take a little
01:57:49.20 --> 01:57:50.60 little bit of a breather.
01:57:50.60 --> 01:57:52.72 And so if you're doing something,
01:57:52.72 --> 01:57:54.88 that's uncomfortable, but it's making you stronger,
01:57:54.88 --> 01:57:57.92 or smarter, or faster, yeah, that's good.
01:57:57.92 --> 01:58:01.52 If you're doing something that's uncomfortable,
01:58:01.52 --> 01:58:03.80 and it's not beneficial to you,
01:58:03.80 --> 01:58:05.52 then that's not smart to do,
01:58:05.52 --> 01:58:07.72 except for the occasional god check,
01:58:07.72 --> 01:58:09.32 which is how you're gonna suck.
01:58:10.32 --> 01:58:11.60 This is just gonna suck,
01:58:11.60 --> 01:58:13.84 and I'm gonna do it anyways.
01:58:13.84 --> 01:58:14.68 And that's fine.
01:58:14.68 --> 01:58:19.68 So, you're kinda different than people.
01:58:21.44 --> 01:58:23.64 The concept that you're talking about,
01:58:23.64 --> 01:58:25.24 I think, yeah, that's universal,
01:58:25.24 --> 01:58:26.84 which is good, like, you talk about,
01:58:26.84 --> 01:58:28.60 like, going on the plane, right?
01:58:28.60 --> 01:58:30.84 Even the way you're like, that has no good
01:58:30.84 --> 01:58:33.44 for humanity, you know, I know that was like a joking way,
01:58:33.44 --> 01:58:37.60 it's putting it, but the thing is that is good for you.
01:58:37.60 --> 01:58:39.84 And it's, what is, is it lander?
01:58:39.84 --> 01:58:41.44 Is it lander, whatever you watch,
01:58:41.44 --> 01:58:43.24 or something that's not work?
01:58:43.24 --> 01:58:45.04 Because it's like, you know, compared to a workout,
01:58:45.04 --> 01:58:46.20 Rob Jones does this a lot,
01:58:46.20 --> 01:58:48.16 he'll compare it to like lifting weights or workout.
01:58:48.16 --> 01:58:52.000 Which is good, I think, up near perfect analogy,
01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:53.04 the work you know, I think.
01:58:53.04 --> 01:58:55.68 It's essentially just your rest between sets.
01:58:55.68 --> 01:58:56.72 That's all it is.
01:58:56.72 --> 01:58:59.40 So if it's like, yeah, you don't get rest between sets.
01:58:59.40 --> 01:59:01.88 Oh, yeah, see how much weight you can lift in,
01:59:01.88 --> 01:59:03.40 probably not that much.
01:59:03.40 --> 01:59:05.000 But there's a difference between resting
01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.44 for like two minutes between your sets
01:59:06.44 --> 01:59:08.60 and then resting one day.
01:59:08.60 --> 01:59:09.88 Yeah, I agree.
01:59:09.88 --> 01:59:13.84 Sometimes though, sometimes you can say,
01:59:13.84 --> 01:59:15.68 oh, I need a rest, but you don't really do that.
01:59:15.68 --> 01:59:18.04 What I mean, yeah, you gotta be careful of that.
01:59:18.04 --> 01:59:19.92 Sometimes you gotta go, oh, this is just torture.
01:59:19.92 --> 01:59:22.64 So I don't wanna do it, but you really just being mentally weak.
01:59:22.64 --> 01:59:24.20 So you have to be aware.
01:59:24.20 --> 01:59:26.12 You have to do things that suck sometimes.
01:59:26.12 --> 01:59:27.52 Yeah, for sure.
01:59:27.52 --> 01:59:29.24 Some workouts just suck.
01:59:29.24 --> 01:59:30.08 Yeah.
01:59:30.08 --> 01:59:30.76 And they're awful.
01:59:30.76 --> 01:59:33.12 And they're torture, but they make you stronger.
01:59:33.12 --> 01:59:35.32 They make you better and they make you tougher.
01:59:35.32 --> 01:59:36.16 Yeah.
01:59:36.16 --> 01:59:36.88 So you do them.
01:59:36.88 --> 01:59:37.72 Yeah.
01:59:37.72 --> 01:59:39.84 So a perfect, and then if you want to do the workout,
01:59:39.84 --> 01:59:41.92 and analogy, where you're like, okay,
01:59:41.92 --> 01:59:44.92 so those two dichotomies, if you will.
01:59:44.92 --> 01:59:47.96 So it's like, okay, rest between sets, cool, I dig it.
01:59:47.96 --> 01:59:50.16 You do work, and then you rest between sets.
01:59:50.16 --> 01:59:51.80 That's the whole thing, right?
01:59:51.80 --> 01:59:52.88 Format.
01:59:52.88 --> 01:59:56.16 But you're like, okay, if I need two minutes of rest
01:59:56.16 --> 01:59:58.48 in between my sets for this specific workout
01:59:58.48 --> 02:00:01.24 for this specific outcome or results from the workout,
02:00:01.24 --> 02:00:02.28 then boom, that's what I'm gonna do.
02:00:02.28 --> 02:00:03.92 I'm gonna rest for two minutes.
02:00:03.92 --> 02:00:05.40 So there's difference between, in that case,
02:00:05.40 --> 02:00:07.24 there's a difference between resting two minutes
02:00:07.24 --> 02:00:09.92 and then resting 15 minutes.
02:00:09.92 --> 02:00:11.000 You don't need all that rest.
02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.12 Now you're just cruising.
02:00:12.12 --> 02:00:14.04 Now you're just avoiding the next set
02:00:14.04 --> 02:00:16.08 or putting it off or doing whatever.
02:00:16.08 --> 02:00:16.92 There's a difference.
02:00:16.92 --> 02:00:19.12 But on the other side, the more extreme
02:00:19.12 --> 02:00:21.12 the side of the spectrum, the workout can be like
02:00:21.12 --> 02:00:21.96 not two minutes rest.
02:00:21.96 --> 02:00:24.16 The workout, the whole workout could last two hours long.
02:00:24.16 --> 02:00:25.24 No rest between sets.
02:00:25.24 --> 02:00:26.72 That's the workout.
02:00:26.72 --> 02:00:28.000 But when the workout's done,
02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.76 you still gotta rest and recover from that workout.
02:00:30.76 --> 02:00:32.92 So just because you don't have a set amount of sets
02:00:32.92 --> 02:00:35.24 in your work day to day,
02:00:35.24 --> 02:00:36.92 still doesn't mean you need that rest
02:00:36.92 --> 02:00:39.04 between sets or the various rest between workouts.
02:00:39.04 --> 02:00:40.80 One thing that I got used to in the military
02:00:40.80 --> 02:00:42.32 and I see it in companies all the time,
02:00:42.32 --> 02:00:45.40 like I could work 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
02:00:45.40 --> 02:00:47.60 never stop and never get everything done.
02:00:47.60 --> 02:00:49.24 Yeah, that's something to think about.
02:00:49.24 --> 02:00:50.64 So then you have to save yourself,
02:00:50.64 --> 02:00:52.000 well, how productive am I gonna be
02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:53.84 and what's important and what's not important?
02:00:53.84 --> 02:00:55.84 And you gotta make sure that you get your right.
02:00:55.84 --> 02:00:58.40 If you take no rest,
02:00:58.40 --> 02:01:00.92 you won't be able to function properly.
02:01:00.92 --> 02:01:04.16 And for me, like I could write 24 hours a day
02:01:04.16 --> 02:01:06.72 and not write all the books I want to write.
02:01:06.72 --> 02:01:08.28 I could do Gigi Gigi 24 hours a day
02:01:08.28 --> 02:01:09.52 and not get as good as I want to get.
02:01:09.52 --> 02:01:10.56 I could work out 24 hours a day
02:01:10.56 --> 02:01:11.68 and not get as strong as I want to get.
02:01:11.68 --> 02:01:12.76 So you have to figure out how to balance
02:01:12.76 --> 02:01:15.96 all those different items together to figure out,
02:01:15.96 --> 02:01:17.76 like, okay, what is an acceptable level
02:01:17.76 --> 02:01:19.76 at each one of these components?
02:01:19.76 --> 02:01:22.72 Yeah, and it's gonna take kind of identifying the results
02:01:22.72 --> 02:01:25.56 that you want that are acceptable to you.
02:01:25.56 --> 02:01:27.60 So yeah, like a little witty called,
02:01:27.60 --> 02:01:30.48 there's the, like NASCAR, right?
02:01:30.48 --> 02:01:32.52 You're watching streets of thunder.
02:01:32.52 --> 02:01:34.08 I don't know, the long-time cruise.
02:01:34.08 --> 02:01:35.52 That is a NASCAR.
02:01:35.52 --> 02:01:38.28 There's something of thunder, days of thunder.
02:01:38.28 --> 02:01:41.16 Anyway, he's like racing and he's like,
02:01:41.16 --> 02:01:44.48 hey, you gotta do a pit stop.
02:01:44.48 --> 02:01:46.36 Everybody gotta do a pit stop.
02:01:46.36 --> 02:01:48.76 But it seems weird when you're like racing
02:01:48.76 --> 02:01:50.60 and you're like, hey, I'm ahead of everybody.
02:01:50.60 --> 02:01:51.84 I'm not gonna stop right now.
02:01:51.84 --> 02:01:53.12 I'm for word, you know, but,
02:01:53.12 --> 02:01:55.76 but, you know, your wheels are gonna fall off, right?
02:01:55.76 --> 02:01:57.60 So you gotta pit stop sometimes.
02:01:57.60 --> 02:01:59.80 Watch some Zulander, whatever.
02:01:59.80 --> 02:02:00.96 And then when you're done,
02:02:00.96 --> 02:02:02.08 you can be way more productive
02:02:02.08 --> 02:02:03.96 because those tires are new now.
02:02:03.96 --> 02:02:05.60 So they can fly around the track.
02:02:05.60 --> 02:02:07.20 Grip everything, seems same.
02:02:08.48 --> 02:02:09.32 Cooker.
02:02:09.32 --> 02:02:10.20 So that's part of the game.
02:02:10.20 --> 02:02:11.04 That's what I'm saying.
02:02:11.04 --> 02:02:12.60 Next question.
02:02:12.60 --> 02:02:15.48 How does the introduction you gave to Mike
02:02:15.48 --> 02:02:18.24 in the equipment room square with extreme ownership?
02:02:18.24 --> 02:02:19.84 No judgment, just trying to...
02:02:19.84 --> 02:02:21.92 Oh yeah, so Mike's a rally when Mike's really came
02:02:21.92 --> 02:02:25.32 into task in a bruiser because his other task
02:02:25.32 --> 02:02:28.64 had had some leadership issues
02:02:28.64 --> 02:02:31.44 and Mike was sort of the collateral damage
02:02:31.44 --> 02:02:32.56 in that whole thing.
02:02:32.56 --> 02:02:34.24 And so they moved him from that task
02:02:34.24 --> 02:02:36.60 in it which was task, unit Charlie,
02:02:36.60 --> 02:02:38.16 into task, unit bruiser.
02:02:38.16 --> 02:02:40.16 And when he came in, I brought him
02:02:40.16 --> 02:02:41.72 into the equipment room at Seal Team 3,
02:02:41.72 --> 02:02:44.96 which is where I would counsel my junior officers.
02:02:44.96 --> 02:02:47.92 Because there was the, there was construction going on.
02:02:47.92 --> 02:02:48.76 At Seal Team 3 at the time,
02:02:48.76 --> 02:02:50.68 there was no ceiling, so everyone could hear you
02:02:50.68 --> 02:02:52.52 in your office.
02:02:52.52 --> 02:02:54.32 And so I would go into this equipment room
02:02:54.32 --> 02:02:56.56 and brief guys if need be.
02:02:56.56 --> 02:02:57.76 And I just brought Mike's rally in there
02:02:57.76 --> 02:03:02.44 and I had a counseling letter for him to sign
02:03:02.44 --> 02:03:05.32 and it said there's no drama in task, unit bruiser.
02:03:06.52 --> 02:03:07.84 Don't bring any into it.
02:03:08.92 --> 02:03:11.40 And that's it.
02:03:11.40 --> 02:03:12.56 It was like really straightforward.
02:03:12.56 --> 02:03:14.64 I don't know, I'm not gonna ask him if he still has it.
02:03:14.64 --> 02:03:16.68 But I don't know why this person thinks
02:03:16.68 --> 02:03:19.08 that that doesn't square with the extreme ownership.
02:03:19.08 --> 02:03:20.72 This one as I'm concerned that is,
02:03:20.72 --> 02:03:23.04 I had a guy that was coming into a unit
02:03:23.04 --> 02:03:25.92 that had been together for seven or eight months,
02:03:25.92 --> 02:03:28.40 gone through work up and ready getting ready
02:03:28.40 --> 02:03:30.84 for deployment and I just had to take ownership
02:03:30.84 --> 02:03:32.52 of the fact that I had a guy that was showing up
02:03:32.52 --> 02:03:36.36 that I didn't know I did get feedback.
02:03:36.36 --> 02:03:39.60 I got feedback from multiple people, multiple sources.
02:03:39.60 --> 02:03:43.28 And my bro source was like, hey,
02:03:43.28 --> 02:03:45.28 Cernelly, he's fucking good to go.
02:03:45.28 --> 02:03:46.28 And I was like, okay, cool.
02:03:46.28 --> 02:03:49.04 So I knew he was good to go, but still,
02:03:49.04 --> 02:03:52.36 I wanted to set the expectation right for him
02:03:52.36 --> 02:03:55.16 so that he knew like, man, he might think that,
02:03:55.16 --> 02:03:58.24 that was his first task unit he was with.
02:03:58.24 --> 02:04:00.16 He might think this is the way it is.
02:04:00.16 --> 02:04:01.56 It's like, no, that's not the way it is.
02:04:01.56 --> 02:04:05.72 So for me, it was just, hey, we're just taking ownership.
02:04:05.72 --> 02:04:07.32 For me, it was, hey, I'm just gonna take ownership
02:04:07.32 --> 02:04:08.56 if this makes sure he knows what's going on.
02:04:08.56 --> 02:04:10.20 Make sure he understands the expectations.
02:04:10.20 --> 02:04:12.000 Make sure that we're not gonna have any drama in here
02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:12.96 because we don't have any drama.
02:04:12.96 --> 02:04:14.52 There's no drama.
02:04:14.52 --> 02:04:16.24 Like we have problems we solve.
02:04:16.24 --> 02:04:18.20 We don't backstab each other
02:04:18.20 --> 02:04:20.52 and tell on each other and stab each other in the back.
02:04:20.52 --> 02:04:21.68 No, we have a problem.
02:04:21.68 --> 02:04:22.88 We get together, we solve the problem.
02:04:22.88 --> 02:04:23.88 That's how it is.
02:04:23.88 --> 02:04:24.88 And so that's all.
02:04:24.88 --> 02:04:26.88 You don't know, I don't even think that's,
02:04:26.88 --> 02:04:30.80 I'm not even quite sure I'd have to get more details
02:04:30.80 --> 02:04:34.52 on this question to figure out why that didn't seem
02:04:34.52 --> 02:04:37.44 like the right thing to do for my perspective.
02:04:37.44 --> 02:04:39.20 It was, you know, it's great
02:04:39.20 --> 02:04:40.80 when you have somebody come on board and say,
02:04:40.80 --> 02:04:43.000 hey man, here's the expectations that are going on.
02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:44.32 Boom.
02:04:44.32 --> 02:04:47.12 Yeah, maybe because that was before he did anything.
02:04:47.12 --> 02:04:48.88 It's like he did something and then you were like,
02:04:48.88 --> 02:04:50.28 hey, you're bringing drama.
02:04:50.28 --> 02:04:51.08 Don't do that here.
02:04:51.08 --> 02:04:53.48 It wasn't that it was like, we don't have drama here.
02:04:53.48 --> 02:04:54.76 Don't bring it in here.
02:04:54.76 --> 02:04:55.60 Yeah.
02:04:55.60 --> 02:04:56.92 You know, with that?
02:04:56.92 --> 02:04:58.84 And Mike's really said, Roger that sir.
02:04:58.84 --> 02:05:00.40 Yeah, makes it.
02:05:00.40 --> 02:05:01.68 Yeah, of course.
02:05:01.68 --> 02:05:03.80 And you know how much drama you brought in?
02:05:03.80 --> 02:05:04.64 Zero.
02:05:05.64 --> 02:05:06.48 Yeah.
02:05:06.48 --> 02:05:10.24 So in a way, I mean, I don't know, looking at it from the outside.
02:05:10.24 --> 02:05:14.56 It seems like that was, you know, the essence of extreme
02:05:14.56 --> 02:05:15.40 ownership.
02:05:15.40 --> 02:05:17.28 You're using some anticipated problems.
02:05:17.28 --> 02:05:18.72 I'm going to do everything to mitigate
02:05:18.72 --> 02:05:20.48 whatever all these things.
02:05:20.48 --> 02:05:24.28 And I'm going to go a pre-empted problem solving mode
02:05:24.28 --> 02:05:25.12 tactfully.
02:05:25.12 --> 02:05:25.96 Yeah.
02:05:25.96 --> 02:05:27.88 And you're way, you know, the locker room.
02:05:27.88 --> 02:05:31.32 Yeah, I wasn't even like I was like, you better not.
02:05:31.32 --> 02:05:32.36 It didn't even accuse anything.
02:05:32.36 --> 02:05:33.36 You know, punty.
02:05:33.36 --> 02:05:35.72 I literally said there's no drama here.
02:05:35.72 --> 02:05:36.52 Yeah.
02:05:36.52 --> 02:05:37.44 Don't bring any.
02:05:37.44 --> 02:05:39.68 I didn't say like, you, we know, you know,
02:05:39.68 --> 02:05:40.84 I didn't get to point my finger.
02:05:40.84 --> 02:05:41.84 No.
02:05:41.84 --> 02:05:43.04 It was like, hey, man.
02:05:43.04 --> 02:05:45.04 Hey, cousin, my mind.
02:05:45.04 --> 02:05:46.76 I'm thinking, we know what I'm thinking of my mind.
02:05:46.76 --> 02:05:49.28 Hey, I got a prior and listed marine.
02:05:49.28 --> 02:05:51.000 That's going to be in my tasking it.
02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:52.28 I got another body.
02:05:52.28 --> 02:05:54.24 And he's an experienced guy.
02:05:54.24 --> 02:05:58.88 With, you know, yeah, I was totally stoked.
02:05:58.88 --> 02:06:00.04 Yeah, I was totally stoked, man.
02:06:00.04 --> 02:06:00.72 Yeah.
02:06:00.72 --> 02:06:02.28 So, no factor.
02:06:02.28 --> 02:06:02.88 No factor.
02:06:02.88 --> 02:06:03.08 All right.
02:06:03.08 --> 02:06:04.88 That's why I got time for one more, man.
02:06:04.88 --> 02:06:06.12 One more question.
02:06:06.12 --> 02:06:07.76 Sure.
02:06:07.76 --> 02:06:10.84 How do you stay on the war path when everything seems
02:06:10.84 --> 02:06:13.16 to be going wrong?
02:06:13.16 --> 02:06:14.16 Good question.
02:06:14.16 --> 02:06:15.88 You think that's a good question?
02:06:15.88 --> 02:06:19.72 Well, here's what I think is strange about that question.
02:06:19.72 --> 02:06:21.28 It's sort of like the question I had
02:06:21.28 --> 02:06:24.64 to answer about like sprinting.
02:06:24.64 --> 02:06:26.32 It's easy to, when things are going right,
02:06:26.32 --> 02:06:28.80 it's easy to stay on the war path.
02:06:28.80 --> 02:06:29.80 Right?
02:06:29.80 --> 02:06:31.72 You don't even need to be on the war path when things are going
02:06:31.72 --> 02:06:32.72 great.
02:06:32.72 --> 02:06:33.72 Because everything's happy.
02:06:33.72 --> 02:06:35.08 There's no war going on.
02:06:35.08 --> 02:06:36.20 You're at peace.
02:06:36.20 --> 02:06:40.16 People are delivering food to you.
02:06:40.16 --> 02:06:42.52 And you're getting a massage.
02:06:42.52 --> 02:06:44.92 There's no, you're not like, oh, I need to be on the war path
02:06:44.92 --> 02:06:45.92 right now.
02:06:45.92 --> 02:06:48.08 While I'm getting a back massage, while I'm getting food
02:06:48.08 --> 02:06:49.40 delivered to me.
02:06:49.40 --> 02:06:51.24 That's not happening.
02:06:51.24 --> 02:06:55.40 When the actual time that you need to go on the war path
02:06:55.40 --> 02:06:57.84 and you need to go harder on the war path
02:06:57.84 --> 02:07:00.08 is when things are going wrong, wrong.
02:07:00.08 --> 02:07:01.64 That's when you need to dig deeper.
02:07:01.64 --> 02:07:06.12 That's when you need to, that's when the whole idea of saying
02:07:06.12 --> 02:07:09.12 good.
02:07:09.12 --> 02:07:11.40 That's when it happens when things are actually
02:07:11.40 --> 02:07:15.24 when you're getting tested by the world.
02:07:15.24 --> 02:07:16.44 That's when you want to do it.
02:07:16.44 --> 02:07:18.60 So when you get tested by the world,
02:07:18.60 --> 02:07:20.64 that's when you get the opportunity to show the world
02:07:20.64 --> 02:07:21.80 what's your made of.
02:07:25.04 --> 02:07:30.28 That's when you get to say, bring it on.
02:07:30.28 --> 02:07:30.76 Bring it on.
02:07:30.76 --> 02:07:31.68 Oh, things are going wrong.
02:07:31.68 --> 02:07:32.76 Bring it on.
02:07:32.76 --> 02:07:36.88 I actually look forward to that.
02:07:36.88 --> 02:07:39.68 Because this is when I get to exercise my discipline.
02:07:39.68 --> 02:07:42.16 This is when I get to show the discipline.
02:07:42.16 --> 02:07:44.24 I get to put the discipline to work.
02:07:44.24 --> 02:07:47.16 It's the moment I have been waiting for.
02:07:47.16 --> 02:07:50.04 Because let's face it.
02:07:50.04 --> 02:07:55.52 If things were easy, then I could just sit around and slack off.
02:07:55.52 --> 02:07:56.52 Right?
02:07:56.52 --> 02:07:57.84 That's what happens.
02:07:57.84 --> 02:08:00.44 When things are easy, when things are going right,
02:08:00.44 --> 02:08:02.80 that's when you actually can slack off a little bit
02:08:02.80 --> 02:08:03.48 because things are going right.
02:08:03.48 --> 02:08:04.80 I don't recommend it.
02:08:04.80 --> 02:08:06.32 I recommend actually when things are going right,
02:08:06.32 --> 02:08:07.44 you go hard.
02:08:07.44 --> 02:08:08.40 But when things are going wrong,
02:08:08.40 --> 02:08:09.88 you need to go even harder.
02:08:14.24 --> 02:08:16.84 So if everything's going wrong,
02:08:16.84 --> 02:08:21.84 it doesn't matter to me because I'm on the path.
02:08:23.16 --> 02:08:25.68 I'm going to stay on the path on the war path.
02:08:26.76 --> 02:08:29.96 I'm going to get my situation rectified.
02:08:29.96 --> 02:08:30.96 Stat.
02:08:32.20 --> 02:08:33.04 Get some.
02:08:35.28 --> 02:08:36.80 All right.
02:08:36.80 --> 02:08:39.36 That's like two hours or something right now.
02:08:39.36 --> 02:08:43.96 So let's, I don't know, speaking of the war path.
02:08:43.96 --> 02:08:44.80 The path.
02:08:44.80 --> 02:08:45.80 Yes. Yes.
02:08:45.80 --> 02:08:50.56 How could we get people to, you know, how could we assist?
02:08:50.56 --> 02:08:51.96 With people being on the war step one,
02:08:51.96 --> 02:08:53.20 you do to that's in.
02:08:53.20 --> 02:08:54.04 That's right.
02:08:54.04 --> 02:08:55.84 Maybe that's step.
02:08:55.84 --> 02:08:57.44 Yeah, man, that's step one straight up.
02:08:57.44 --> 02:08:58.28 Made one make.
02:08:58.28 --> 02:08:59.40 Depends on where you are to begin.
02:08:59.40 --> 02:09:00.40 So let's face it.
02:09:00.40 --> 02:09:02.76 Anyway, so you need your, your key right.
02:09:02.76 --> 02:09:04.04 No need to ask anymore.
02:09:04.04 --> 02:09:07.80 Get an origin gate origin main.com 100%.
02:09:07.80 --> 02:09:10.32 100% made in America.
02:09:10.32 --> 02:09:14.68 Yes, 100% good to get the gate and also 100%
02:09:14.68 --> 02:09:15.96 made in America.
02:09:15.96 --> 02:09:21.68 You made in America from the dirt to the githop straight up.
02:09:21.68 --> 02:09:25.32 Yeah, because it leads face it from the top soil to the githop.
02:09:25.32 --> 02:09:28.32 Top, so it tops little to the top of the githop.
02:09:28.32 --> 02:09:29.44 Yeah, fully.
02:09:29.44 --> 02:09:36.44 And for those who care about the aesthetics of the github,
02:09:36.44 --> 02:09:39.12 these aesthetics are, how should I say?
02:09:40.92 --> 02:09:43.24 Made specifically for you just to for sure.
02:09:43.24 --> 02:09:44.64 But I do do people.
02:09:44.64 --> 02:09:45.64 But you do do people?
02:09:45.64 --> 02:09:46.80 Yes.
02:09:46.80 --> 02:09:48.08 But they're like, they're cut.
02:09:48.08 --> 02:09:50.84 You know how they like, they're not like for G2.
02:09:50.84 --> 02:09:51.84 You can see them.
02:09:51.84 --> 02:09:52.80 And they look dope too.
02:09:52.80 --> 02:09:55.04 By the way, if you care about that, can stuff.
02:09:55.04 --> 02:09:55.88 Yeah, just a little bit.
02:09:55.88 --> 02:09:57.20 You want to make like you don't care.
02:09:57.20 --> 02:09:58.20 But you care.
02:09:58.20 --> 02:10:03.80 No, I am and always have been impressed by
02:10:03.80 --> 02:10:05.52 specifically dragon weave.
02:10:05.52 --> 02:10:06.52 Bigger.
02:10:06.52 --> 02:10:07.52 Come on.
02:10:07.52 --> 02:10:08.36 Yeah, I did.
02:10:08.36 --> 02:10:09.20 A dragon weave.
02:10:09.20 --> 02:10:12.32 You're not like a like, I still am impressed.
02:10:12.32 --> 02:10:13.32 It is.
02:10:13.32 --> 02:10:14.32 You know what I mean?
02:10:14.32 --> 02:10:15.32 Yeah.
02:10:15.32 --> 02:10:20.76 Have you seen the machine that they, that they figure out how to weave that thing?
02:10:20.76 --> 02:10:21.76 It's like a old.
02:10:21.76 --> 02:10:23.44 It's in pizza office.
02:10:23.44 --> 02:10:27.20 And it's like, it's, I'll have people to picture of it.
02:10:27.20 --> 02:10:34.08 But it's like, it looks like a mechanical thing from from 1898.
02:10:34.08 --> 02:10:36.28 I bet just from 1930.
02:10:36.28 --> 02:10:38.24 I bet you the thing is actually from 1930.
02:10:38.24 --> 02:10:40.16 Well, I have to ask Pete what year it is.
02:10:40.16 --> 02:10:41.60 But that's the actual thing.
02:10:41.60 --> 02:10:44.52 It's the old school thing that you figure out.
02:10:44.52 --> 02:10:46.24 You program is the work.
02:10:46.24 --> 02:10:47.24 But it's nothing.
02:10:47.24 --> 02:10:49.76 There's nothing digital about this.
02:10:49.76 --> 02:10:53.36 Program, what the fabric is going to look like from this machine.
02:10:53.36 --> 02:10:55.16 It's freaking, it's cool.
02:10:55.16 --> 02:10:56.16 Anyways, yeah.
02:10:56.16 --> 02:10:57.16 So that's a dragon weave.
02:10:57.16 --> 02:10:58.68 Also, rashguards.
02:10:58.68 --> 02:11:01.88 Also, 100% made in America.
02:11:01.88 --> 02:11:04.88 T-shirts, other things.
02:11:04.88 --> 02:11:06.28 Some cool stuff on that.
02:11:06.28 --> 02:11:07.28 Yeah.
02:11:07.28 --> 02:11:08.28 Supplements as well.
02:11:08.28 --> 02:11:09.28 Yeah.
02:11:09.28 --> 02:11:18.96 And supplements for your joints, a, for your being as a human.
02:11:18.96 --> 02:11:22.88 And for your operational capabilities.
02:11:22.88 --> 02:11:29.76 So join warfare for your joints, krill oil for your being, and joint.
02:11:29.76 --> 02:11:36.64 And joints, discipline for your operational capability.
02:11:36.64 --> 02:11:42.72 And lift your cognitive and your physical capabilities.
02:11:42.72 --> 02:11:45.000 And then, of course, we got that milk.
02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.36 So my additional protein for that.
02:11:47.36 --> 02:11:48.36 One.
02:11:48.36 --> 02:11:51.76 Had a big milkshake, put dark chocolate in it, by the way.
02:11:51.76 --> 02:11:53.36 You said that on the last podcast.
02:11:53.36 --> 02:11:54.36 Yeah, but you can put it in.
02:11:54.36 --> 02:11:55.36 Yes.
02:11:55.36 --> 02:11:56.36 And I put dark chocolate.
02:11:56.36 --> 02:11:57.36 Oh, dark chocolate.
02:11:57.36 --> 02:11:58.36 How outstanding.
02:11:58.36 --> 02:11:59.36 With what flavor, milk?
02:11:59.36 --> 02:12:00.36 Peanut butter chocolate.
02:12:00.36 --> 02:12:01.96 Is that your go-to?
02:12:01.96 --> 02:12:02.96 Currently it is.
02:12:02.96 --> 02:12:03.96 It was the main thing.
02:12:03.96 --> 02:12:04.96 It is for me too.
02:12:04.96 --> 02:12:05.96 Yeah.
02:12:05.96 --> 02:12:09.08 And it's all based on like how I feel.
02:12:09.08 --> 02:12:17.72 I'm just going to tell you, I probably have had peanut butter six times in a row, which
02:12:17.72 --> 02:12:19.84 it used to be not happening.
02:12:19.84 --> 02:12:22.36 It would be mint six times in a row.
02:12:22.36 --> 02:12:25.60 And then right now, I'm just so down with that peanut butter.
02:12:25.60 --> 02:12:26.60 Just down the foot.
02:12:26.60 --> 02:12:27.72 Yeah, on the peanut butter train.
02:12:27.72 --> 02:12:28.72 Situation.
02:12:28.72 --> 02:12:29.72 Yeah.
02:12:29.72 --> 02:12:30.72 But yeah.
02:12:30.72 --> 02:12:33.52 So these supplements overall, especially the joint ones, like, markets,
02:12:33.52 --> 02:12:37.56 it's like a kind of, just me alone with my thoughts.
02:12:37.56 --> 02:12:38.88 I'm like, this is kind of a glamorous one.
02:12:38.88 --> 02:12:40.08 The protein hell.
02:12:40.08 --> 02:12:41.08 Yeah, my muscles.
02:12:41.08 --> 02:12:42.08 Yeah.
02:12:42.08 --> 02:12:45.04 But the joint warfare, they don't get like the glamour.
02:12:45.04 --> 02:12:50.68 Here's what one of my buddies was telling me yesterday, one of my brethren, seals
02:12:50.68 --> 02:12:53.28 was using vanilla gorilla.
02:12:53.28 --> 02:12:56.08 And he's like, I'm putting it in everything.
02:12:56.08 --> 02:12:57.08 Yeah.
02:12:57.08 --> 02:12:58.08 Yeah.
02:12:58.08 --> 02:12:59.08 Yeah.
02:12:59.08 --> 02:13:00.08 Everything he makes is coffee.
02:13:00.08 --> 02:13:01.08 Yeah, yeah.
02:13:01.08 --> 02:13:02.08 I don't know.
02:13:02.08 --> 02:13:04.32 I don't know about tea, but his main thing was coffee.
02:13:04.32 --> 02:13:05.52 He's like, yeah.
02:13:05.52 --> 02:13:06.72 He's putting it in his coffee.
02:13:06.72 --> 02:13:07.72 Yeah.
02:13:07.72 --> 02:13:08.84 And he said it's like a sweetener.
02:13:08.84 --> 02:13:12.44 But obviously it's not bad for you.
02:13:12.44 --> 02:13:13.44 Yeah.
02:13:13.44 --> 02:13:14.44 It is sweetener because it makes a great thing.
02:13:14.44 --> 02:13:15.44 It makes a great thing.
02:13:15.44 --> 02:13:20.92 He was, you know when you talk to people and they get like the, the like, little, the
02:13:20.92 --> 02:13:21.92 little kid looking.
02:13:21.92 --> 02:13:22.92 Yeah.
02:13:22.92 --> 02:13:23.92 Yeah.
02:13:23.92 --> 02:13:24.92 He had that.
02:13:24.92 --> 02:13:25.92 I put the vanilla gorilla there.
02:13:25.92 --> 02:13:29.72 I could say he was getting fired up when he said he hit it with the blender.
02:13:29.72 --> 02:13:32.56 Yeah.
02:13:32.56 --> 02:13:38.64 So technically I do the same thing, but I put the coffee in.
02:13:38.64 --> 02:13:41.24 It's like a lower and a sprester, whatever, in the milk.
02:13:41.24 --> 02:13:42.24 Oh, yeah.
02:13:42.24 --> 02:13:43.64 So it's like a milkshake.
02:13:43.64 --> 02:13:46.64 It's like the same deal, but I'm sure the rest of the stuff.
02:13:46.64 --> 02:13:47.64 It's just a different thing.
02:13:47.64 --> 02:13:48.64 It's like coffee.
02:13:48.64 --> 02:13:49.64 It is.
02:13:49.64 --> 02:13:50.64 And that's the thing.
02:13:50.64 --> 02:13:54.84 So if you, like like coffee ice cream, you know, like that kind of stuff,
02:13:54.84 --> 02:13:58.20 where coffee ice cream and like black coffee, those are two different experiences for
02:13:58.20 --> 02:13:59.20 sure.
02:13:59.20 --> 02:14:03.44 Coffee ice cream, that's the delicious flavor when it's like delicious.
02:14:03.44 --> 02:14:05.12 So it's kind of the same deal with the milk.
02:14:05.12 --> 02:14:14.48 Speaking of delicious strawberry and chocolate or your kid milk for your children, I, this,
02:14:14.48 --> 02:14:19.40 this could get some kind of, you know, I'm not going to put myself in for a Nobel Peace
02:14:19.40 --> 02:14:20.40 Prize.
02:14:20.40 --> 02:14:31.04 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:14:31.04 --> 02:14:31.96 But like, hey, we are helping the children of the world in a big way with strawberry and
02:14:31.96 --> 02:14:34.12 chocolate, where your kid milk.
02:14:34.12 --> 02:14:38.76 Because there's no other thing that you're just as a kid, as a kid, you're about that
02:14:38.76 --> 02:14:40.56 little Snickers bar hitter, right?
02:14:40.56 --> 02:14:42.56 You know, with these bad snacks and the kids.
02:14:42.56 --> 02:14:43.56 Yeah, bad snack.
02:14:43.56 --> 02:14:44.96 Yeah, hitters, right?
02:14:44.96 --> 02:14:45.96 Sure.
02:14:45.96 --> 02:14:46.96 You right?
02:14:46.96 --> 02:14:47.96 Yes.
02:14:47.96 --> 02:14:51.28 And then you're going to have a fun on that one because he understands hitters better
02:14:51.28 --> 02:14:52.28 than me.
02:14:52.28 --> 02:14:58.68 But if you can give your kid a strawberry or chocolate, milk, hitter, they're just good to go.
02:14:58.68 --> 02:14:59.68 So stoked.
02:14:59.68 --> 02:15:01.68 And they're going to get stronger.
02:15:01.68 --> 02:15:02.68 Yeah.
02:15:02.68 --> 02:15:03.68 Literally.
02:15:03.68 --> 02:15:04.68 Help you.
02:15:04.68 --> 02:15:08.68 I told Pete, I said, on the warrior kid podcast that warrior kid milk will make you
02:15:08.68 --> 02:15:09.68 stronger.
02:15:09.68 --> 02:15:13.96 He's like, I don't know if you can legally make that claim.
02:15:13.96 --> 02:15:17.20 I'm like, well, it's already been said.
02:15:17.20 --> 02:15:18.20 Yeah.
02:15:18.20 --> 02:15:19.20 And it's straight up.
02:15:19.20 --> 02:15:23.60 How can you, how can you not, how can that not be legally made because does protein
02:15:23.60 --> 02:15:24.60 rebuild your muscles?
02:15:24.60 --> 02:15:25.60 Yes.
02:15:25.60 --> 02:15:26.60 Answer.
02:15:26.60 --> 02:15:27.60 Yes.
02:15:27.60 --> 02:15:28.60 Does warrior kid milk have protein in it?
02:15:28.60 --> 02:15:29.60 Yes.
02:15:29.60 --> 02:15:33.12 I guess we got to get the kids to jack steel, too.
02:15:33.12 --> 02:15:35.08 Or just grow up as a kid, healthy.
02:15:35.08 --> 02:15:37.24 Yeah, you'll get stronger as a kid growing up.
02:15:37.24 --> 02:15:38.40 You don't have to jack in East.
02:15:38.40 --> 02:15:44.68 So we are technically and legally authorized to say to the children of the world warrior
02:15:44.68 --> 02:15:47.12 kid milk will make you stronger.
02:15:47.12 --> 02:15:52.80 If I get the Nobel Prize for that, you get Nobel Prize for helping children around the world.
02:15:52.80 --> 02:15:53.80 Yes.
02:15:53.80 --> 02:15:54.80 Then I deserve it.
02:15:54.80 --> 02:15:55.80 Yeah.
02:15:55.80 --> 02:15:56.80 All right.
02:15:56.80 --> 02:15:57.80 There you go.
02:15:57.80 --> 02:16:02.68 And enough to go too deep into the whole thing about getting stronger.
02:16:02.68 --> 02:16:05.44 Like if you make the claim that something's going to make you stronger, I think that
02:16:05.44 --> 02:16:10.72 is fine, like legally because legally you can't like diagnose.
02:16:10.72 --> 02:16:11.72 It wasn't with it.
02:16:11.72 --> 02:16:13.76 There's certain there's a list of things you can do.
02:16:13.76 --> 02:16:15.08 You can't diagnose.
02:16:15.08 --> 02:16:16.08 You can't.
02:16:16.08 --> 02:16:17.08 Oh, treat.
02:16:17.08 --> 02:16:21.32 You know, they're specific kind of, they're more medically based.
02:16:21.32 --> 02:16:22.32 I think.
02:16:22.32 --> 02:16:23.32 But I don't know.
02:16:23.32 --> 02:16:27.24 Well, the only thing that we really, the only claim that we make, which is scientifically
02:16:27.24 --> 02:16:31.76 proven, is the deadlift capabilities.
02:16:31.76 --> 02:16:33.28 If you drink, drop a white TSA 1000 pounds.
02:16:33.28 --> 02:16:34.28 It doesn't sound.
02:16:34.28 --> 02:16:37.68 Which I mean, obviously, no one's going to argue with that.
02:16:37.68 --> 02:16:38.68 No.
02:16:38.68 --> 02:16:39.68 No.
02:16:39.68 --> 02:16:41.08 Because that's just facts.
02:16:41.08 --> 02:16:46.36 So if you want some of the, if you want some, jocco white T because you need a bigger
02:16:46.36 --> 02:16:53.56 deadlift, which you probably do, then you can get that from Amazon.
02:16:53.56 --> 02:16:55.12 Well, the cans from Amazon.
02:16:55.12 --> 02:16:56.12 The cans from Amazon.
02:16:56.12 --> 02:16:58.60 The key you can get to everywhere.
02:16:58.60 --> 02:17:00.96 Everywhere meaning online, just go online, man.
02:17:00.96 --> 02:17:01.96 Okay.
02:17:01.96 --> 02:17:02.56 Jocco white T.
02:17:02.56 --> 02:17:03.56 It's on the store.
02:17:03.56 --> 02:17:04.56 Okay.
02:17:04.56 --> 02:17:05.56 There you go.
02:17:05.56 --> 02:17:06.56 On what store?
02:17:06.56 --> 02:17:07.56 Jocco store.
02:17:07.56 --> 02:17:08.96 It's called Jocco store.
02:17:08.96 --> 02:17:11.24 And the website is joccostore.com.
02:17:11.24 --> 02:17:12.24 It's online.
02:17:12.24 --> 02:17:14.68 Did you see the website for origin?
02:17:14.68 --> 02:17:15.68 Or the doc.
02:17:15.68 --> 02:17:16.68 Yeah.
02:17:16.68 --> 02:17:21.64 Oh yeah, for all this, the jocco, uh, joint warfare, moalk, the geese, the rash guy, the
02:17:21.64 --> 02:17:23.60 origin stuff is all that origin main.com.
02:17:23.60 --> 02:17:25.68 I did say it, but, you know, that's a little reminder.
02:17:25.68 --> 02:17:26.68 Yeah.
02:17:26.68 --> 02:17:33.80 But, jocco white T is everywhere, including joccostore.com.
02:17:33.80 --> 02:17:37.68 Also on joccostore.com is where you can get your shirts when you're representing on the
02:17:37.68 --> 02:17:38.68 path.
02:17:38.68 --> 02:17:40.32 See, and that's a big part of being on the path.
02:17:40.32 --> 02:17:43.52 Actually, that's a good psychological and physical.
02:17:43.52 --> 02:17:44.52 Yeah.
02:17:44.52 --> 02:17:45.52 Experience.
02:17:45.52 --> 02:17:46.52 I don't know.
02:17:46.52 --> 02:17:47.92 You're going to say, but I know what you're going to say.
02:17:47.92 --> 02:17:48.92 What?
02:17:48.92 --> 02:17:49.92 It helps you stand the path.
02:17:49.92 --> 02:17:52.08 Well, you're not going to eat a donut while you're wearing a discount because
02:17:52.08 --> 02:17:53.08 we're eating T shirt.
02:17:53.08 --> 02:17:54.08 Exactly.
02:17:54.08 --> 02:17:55.48 That's, that's, it's physically impossible.
02:17:55.48 --> 02:17:56.48 I think so.
02:17:56.48 --> 02:17:57.48 Yes.
02:17:57.48 --> 02:17:59.72 You'll be like, you'll, you'll be like the exercise.
02:17:59.72 --> 02:18:03.64 You just won't be able to stop yourself from throwing the donut box in the garbage
02:18:03.64 --> 02:18:04.64 can.
02:18:04.64 --> 02:18:06.52 You know, it's weird and being serious.
02:18:06.52 --> 02:18:07.52 It's like now.
02:18:07.52 --> 02:18:08.52 Let me see.
02:18:08.52 --> 02:18:09.52 No.
02:18:09.52 --> 02:18:12.96 Like, I can't eat a donut.
02:18:12.96 --> 02:18:15.40 Even if I'm by myself, like, I can't.
02:18:15.40 --> 02:18:20.40 It's embedded already because it's like a thousand of the path.
02:18:20.40 --> 02:18:23.16 It prevents me physically from eating the donut.
02:18:23.16 --> 02:18:28.64 The only donut I could eat is one that is an actual piece of steak cut into a circle
02:18:28.64 --> 02:18:30.76 with a piece missing from the middle.
02:18:30.76 --> 02:18:31.76 Yeah.
02:18:31.76 --> 02:18:32.76 I might do that.
02:18:32.76 --> 02:18:33.76 Maybe.
02:18:33.76 --> 02:18:34.76 I might be like, here's my dough.
02:18:34.76 --> 02:18:36.56 I can steak donut just to get some.
02:18:36.56 --> 02:18:37.96 Well, here's the thing though.
02:18:37.96 --> 02:18:40.24 There's such thing as like little protein donuts.
02:18:40.24 --> 02:18:42.04 Yeah, but if you look at the ingredients.
02:18:42.04 --> 02:18:43.04 I don't know.
02:18:43.04 --> 02:18:46.56 What if it was like a paleo protein or help you when people make paleo stuff?
02:18:46.56 --> 02:18:47.56 It's like kind of solid.
02:18:47.56 --> 02:18:50.04 Okay, why not shape it like a stick?
02:18:50.04 --> 02:18:51.04 Yeah, I know.
02:18:51.04 --> 02:18:52.04 Really?
02:18:52.04 --> 02:18:53.04 I think you have a point of it.
02:18:53.04 --> 02:18:54.04 I'm putting it into a donut.
02:18:54.04 --> 02:18:55.04 Yes.
02:18:55.04 --> 02:18:56.04 This scenario.
02:18:56.04 --> 02:18:57.04 Because I think that's it.
02:18:57.04 --> 02:18:58.04 I think that's the thing.
02:18:58.04 --> 02:19:01.80 It's like the fact that it's a donut kind of is that's what kind of creates the
02:19:01.80 --> 02:19:03.80 little thing in my brain.
02:19:03.80 --> 02:19:07.32 Anyway, anyway, back to the storage aqua store.
02:19:07.32 --> 02:19:08.32 Who's on there?
02:19:08.32 --> 02:19:10.32 Shirts on there.
02:19:10.32 --> 02:19:11.32 Hats on there.
02:19:11.32 --> 02:19:12.32 A lot of cool stuff on there.
02:19:12.32 --> 02:19:13.32 You want to represent?
02:19:13.32 --> 02:19:17.60 If you're going to represent in the wild, jocostor.com, grab something.
02:19:17.60 --> 02:19:23.32 Keep your on the deaf core path.
02:19:23.32 --> 02:19:25.08 Also, okay, we talked about jocqu IT.
02:19:25.08 --> 02:19:29.60 Obviously, also you want to subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already.
02:19:29.60 --> 02:19:31.24 That'll kind of keep you in tune.
02:19:31.24 --> 02:19:36.000 So to speak, seems obvious, I guess, but it'll seem like a small thing.
02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.52 But hey, it's good to subscribe.
02:19:37.52 --> 02:19:41.88 Staying tuned, staying touch on iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play.
02:19:41.88 --> 02:19:44.88 Anywhere where you listen to your podcast, go subscribe.
02:19:44.88 --> 02:19:50.38 Also, the where your kid podcast is the where your kid podcast better than jocqua
02:19:50.38 --> 02:19:51.38 podcast.
02:19:51.38 --> 02:19:55.16 I personally don't think so at the end of the day, what do you say?
02:19:55.16 --> 02:19:56.16 Net net.
02:19:56.16 --> 02:19:58.16 You ever heard that expression?
02:19:58.16 --> 02:19:59.16 Net net.
02:19:59.16 --> 02:20:00.40 My brother says it all the time.
02:20:00.40 --> 02:20:01.40 Anyway, net net.
02:20:01.40 --> 02:20:04.40 I like the jocqua podcast better.
02:20:04.40 --> 02:20:05.40 Here's a thing, though.
02:20:05.40 --> 02:20:07.40 It's not like just cut and dry.
02:20:07.40 --> 02:20:08.40 You know what?
02:20:08.40 --> 02:20:09.92 There's like legit competition.
02:20:09.92 --> 02:20:10.92 Yeah.
02:20:10.92 --> 02:20:15.48 There's a thing if you were to observe them from a completely unbiased.
02:20:15.48 --> 02:20:18.16 You probably don't like the where your kid podcast because you're not in it.
02:20:18.16 --> 02:20:21.56 I can't freaking rebuttal my stuff.
02:20:21.56 --> 02:20:22.56 Maybe here's it.
02:20:22.56 --> 02:20:23.56 Maybe.
02:20:23.56 --> 02:20:24.56 But here's here yourself.
02:20:24.56 --> 02:20:25.56 Here's the.
02:20:25.56 --> 02:20:26.56 No.
02:20:26.56 --> 02:20:27.56 No.
02:20:27.56 --> 02:20:33.68 Here's the part that kind of, what is it like, is like a rebuttal to my own opinion.
02:20:33.68 --> 02:20:39.88 Where could podcasts every single one of those was like 90.
02:20:39.88 --> 02:20:45.08 Like out to 85 to 100% impactful, like every little thing, like that felt like applied
02:20:45.08 --> 02:20:48.80 to me where I can like, whether it be an idea or talking about your daughter.
02:20:48.80 --> 02:20:49.80 No.
02:20:49.80 --> 02:20:51.04 You're not applied to you.
02:20:51.04 --> 02:20:52.04 To me, there's a human man.
02:20:52.04 --> 02:20:53.04 You're something.
02:20:53.04 --> 02:20:54.04 Something's yes.
02:20:54.04 --> 02:20:56.04 There are 16 years old or whatever you are.
02:20:56.04 --> 02:20:57.04 Yeah.
02:20:57.04 --> 02:20:58.04 Yes.
02:20:58.04 --> 02:21:00.04 But and I'm not saying it doesn't apply to my daughter.
02:21:00.04 --> 02:21:01.04 I'm not saying that.
02:21:01.04 --> 02:21:04.72 I'm saying it applies to me directly, whether it be me in my own life or me, how
02:21:04.72 --> 02:21:07.92 I'm going to deal with my daughter now or my son or whatever.
02:21:07.92 --> 02:21:11.16 Like all of the things pretty much like that's kind of the.
02:21:11.16 --> 02:21:12.80 So net net.
02:21:12.80 --> 02:21:13.80 Yeah.
02:21:13.80 --> 02:21:15.56 Jockel podcast sure I like better.
02:21:15.56 --> 02:21:17.80 Maybe because there's kind of more more thing.
02:21:17.80 --> 02:21:20.28 I don't know why, but that's my answer.
02:21:20.28 --> 02:21:21.28 But I will say this.
02:21:21.28 --> 02:21:22.28 Maybe this.
02:21:22.28 --> 02:21:26.32 Maybe maybe you might be right.
02:21:26.32 --> 02:21:31.16 But maybe because there's some, there's not as many where your kid maybe.
02:21:31.16 --> 02:21:32.16 Yeah.
02:21:32.16 --> 02:21:33.16 Maybe I need more.
02:21:33.16 --> 02:21:35.40 I need more to shift over to for that to be better.
02:21:35.40 --> 02:21:36.40 I don't know.
02:21:36.40 --> 02:21:37.40 Maybe.
02:21:37.40 --> 02:21:38.40 That's on iTunes, situ.
02:21:38.40 --> 02:21:39.40 Oh, yeah.
02:21:39.40 --> 02:21:43.32 That's on that's a podcast as well that you subscribe to also YouTube.
02:21:43.32 --> 02:21:45.96 The way you can do to well there's word.
02:21:45.96 --> 02:21:47.28 Yes, speaking of YouTube.
02:21:47.28 --> 02:21:50.64 There's the Jockel podcast channel on YouTube.
02:21:50.64 --> 02:21:55.04 There's Warrior Kid podcast on YouTube which we separated so that your child won't be
02:21:55.04 --> 02:22:00.24 watching Warrior Kid podcast and then all of a sudden have the rape of Dan King podcast creep
02:22:00.24 --> 02:22:01.24 into their zone.
02:22:01.24 --> 02:22:02.24 Right.
02:22:02.24 --> 02:22:03.52 So we separated them.
02:22:03.52 --> 02:22:08.52 And they're both up there.
02:22:08.52 --> 02:22:10.52 They're both available.
02:22:10.52 --> 02:22:14.44 And also on the Jockel podcast that's where Echo puts up videos with enhancements to them.
02:22:14.44 --> 02:22:19.84 Make them make the message more impactful in his opinion.
02:22:19.84 --> 02:22:24.04 Well, hopefully we'll say hopefully.
02:22:24.04 --> 02:22:30.72 Yeah, like I said though, the Mike in the Dragons video, which is move to the top slot
02:22:30.72 --> 02:22:35.56 in my opinion for your videos, which is a bold statement.
02:22:35.56 --> 02:22:36.56 Cool.
02:22:36.56 --> 02:22:37.56 Yeah.
02:22:37.56 --> 02:22:38.56 It's a bold statement.
02:22:38.56 --> 02:22:43.60 People have got tears in their eyes from a two minute video about a kids book.
02:22:43.60 --> 02:22:44.60 That's pretty impressive.
02:22:44.60 --> 02:22:45.60 Yeah.
02:22:45.60 --> 02:22:48.92 Well, I do have to say I even had tears in my eyes.
02:22:48.92 --> 02:22:50.96 Here's the thing that's I feel.
02:22:50.96 --> 02:22:54.28 And I'm not going to be like, oh, I'm going to, I don't think it's necessarily because
02:22:54.28 --> 02:22:56.36 of me making the video.
02:22:56.36 --> 02:22:58.72 Because like, well, I don't know.
02:22:58.72 --> 02:23:01.48 I'm only speaking for myself, where, okay.
02:23:01.48 --> 02:23:03.48 So the king died.
02:23:03.48 --> 02:23:04.68 This is a story within a story.
02:23:04.68 --> 02:23:06.48 It's a story of a story in a story.
02:23:06.48 --> 02:23:07.76 So there's like three layers there.
02:23:07.76 --> 02:23:13.02 But so the idea of the king dying and then the kid being like young and having this big
02:23:13.02 --> 02:23:18.08 responsibility, he'd done his shoulder and shoulders and him being scared for some reason.
02:23:18.08 --> 02:23:19.08 I don't know.
02:23:19.08 --> 02:23:21.04 I just get just like, oh, whatever about that.
02:23:21.04 --> 02:23:22.68 Oh, I don't know.
02:23:22.68 --> 02:23:24.40 Sensitive about that kind of stuff.
02:23:24.40 --> 02:23:29.64 So when it's like you explaining it and you say it, like you're not being off tough
02:23:29.64 --> 02:23:32.64 jockel, you know, it seems like you're doing it like appropriately.
02:23:32.64 --> 02:23:33.64 It seems same.
02:23:33.64 --> 02:23:34.88 And then so it's like that.
02:23:34.88 --> 02:23:36.56 That's really what kind of affected me.
02:23:36.56 --> 02:23:40.32 And I think sure I laid it out in a way where it's like kind of delivered in the appropriate
02:23:40.32 --> 02:23:41.32 way.
02:23:41.32 --> 02:23:42.32 But is it?
02:23:42.32 --> 02:23:47.16 Oh, I was going to ask if it was more impactful because you and I know the whole story.
02:23:47.16 --> 02:23:51.000 But people that don't know the whole story that didn't have the book yet were like, oh, my
02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:52.000 god.
02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:53.000 Yeah.
02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:54.000 Because you know the whole story.
02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:55.48 It's like, oh, that's cool.
02:23:55.48 --> 02:23:59.28 But then people that didn't know the whole story were just like, oh, you know what?
02:23:59.28 --> 02:24:03.24 Actually, no, no, the thing because Jade said the same thing and he didn't read the whole story.
02:24:03.24 --> 02:24:05.96 And he and he actually had little tears in his eyes.
02:24:05.96 --> 02:24:07.28 He's like, yeah, tears in my eyes.
02:24:07.28 --> 02:24:09.92 I don't know why I like trying to act like it's just so confusing.
02:24:09.92 --> 02:24:12.52 You know, but you know, he's all like being emotional.
02:24:12.52 --> 02:24:13.52 Yeah.
02:24:13.52 --> 02:24:14.52 Yeah.
02:24:14.52 --> 02:24:15.52 I saw what went on.
02:24:15.52 --> 02:24:17.52 So that's the YouTube channel.
02:24:17.52 --> 02:24:18.72 You can subscribe to that.
02:24:18.72 --> 02:24:19.52 That'd be cool.
02:24:19.52 --> 02:24:20.52 We appreciate it.
02:24:20.52 --> 02:24:21.52 And all that stuff.
02:24:21.52 --> 02:24:27.92 And leave the big thing about if you subscribe to the YouTube channel, you need to comment
02:24:27.92 --> 02:24:35.88 about echo because the only compensation that echo receives for participation in this podcast
02:24:35.88 --> 02:24:42.28 is being able to read YouTube comments that say echo is so jacked.
02:24:42.28 --> 02:24:43.28 Yeah.
02:24:43.28 --> 02:24:46.52 So go on YouTube, subscribe.
02:24:46.52 --> 02:24:53.52 And then right echo is yoked echo is jacked echo is looking massive all that kind of stuff
02:24:53.52 --> 02:24:55.48 because that way he'll be happy.
02:24:55.48 --> 02:24:56.64 I can just pay him with that.
02:24:56.64 --> 02:24:57.80 That's what you just paid with.
02:24:57.80 --> 02:25:00.52 Yeah, that's the worst idea I've ever heard.
02:25:00.52 --> 02:25:01.32 It's not that bad.
02:25:01.32 --> 02:25:02.32 Nonetheless.
02:25:02.32 --> 02:25:03.72 But you do like none.
02:25:03.72 --> 02:25:05.84 The less you pointed it out.
02:25:05.84 --> 02:25:06.84 Did you see that?
02:25:06.84 --> 02:25:07.84 Did you do it?
02:25:07.84 --> 02:25:08.84 Did you do it?
02:25:08.84 --> 02:25:12.84 When you were like, you were like, oh, there's always someone that says I look jacked.
02:25:12.84 --> 02:25:13.84 I never said that.
02:25:13.84 --> 02:25:17.92 But anyway, anyway, psychological warfare.
02:25:17.92 --> 02:25:18.92 Okay.
02:25:18.92 --> 02:25:20.88 If you don't know what that is, is what it is.
02:25:20.88 --> 02:25:22.76 It's an album with tracks.
02:25:22.76 --> 02:25:27.84 So on iTunes and Amazon Music and stuff, an album with tracks, Jocco saying, helping you
02:25:27.84 --> 02:25:28.84 us.
02:25:28.84 --> 02:25:29.84 It's helping us.
02:25:29.84 --> 02:25:30.84 That's what he's doing.
02:25:30.84 --> 02:25:34.08 Jocco is helping us through moments of weakness when they arise.
02:25:34.08 --> 02:25:35.32 And they're all right.
02:25:35.32 --> 02:25:36.32 You can't sprint forever.
02:25:36.32 --> 02:25:38.32 Good boy.
02:25:38.32 --> 02:25:43.24 And you might instead of taking appropriate action when you realize you can't sprint forever
02:25:43.24 --> 02:25:48.52 sometimes you might want to take a little bit more rest between sets.
02:25:48.52 --> 02:25:49.52 You don't have to.
02:25:49.52 --> 02:25:50.52 But to shoot it.
02:25:50.52 --> 02:25:52.80 I want to take too much rest.
02:25:52.80 --> 02:25:53.80 You might want to.
02:25:53.80 --> 02:25:54.80 Yes, exactly right.
02:25:54.80 --> 02:25:59.40 And you will not ever jack if you're taking situations between sets.
02:25:59.40 --> 02:26:00.40 So get psychological warfare.
02:26:00.40 --> 02:26:03.40 Yes, the documents Google Play and B3.
02:26:03.40 --> 02:26:04.40 Yes.
02:26:04.40 --> 02:26:05.40 Yes.
02:26:05.40 --> 02:26:07.80 And you'll get past those moments of weakness.
02:26:07.80 --> 02:26:09.32 Because Jocco will just help me through it.
02:26:09.32 --> 02:26:11.76 Just by telling you, that's the thing that's like a little spot.
02:26:11.76 --> 02:26:16.52 You know, when you're slack, you're a little spot in reference to weightlifting.
02:26:16.52 --> 02:26:18.000 Yeah, that's the thing.
02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:19.000 Right.
02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000 Because you someone's trying to lift and they can't quite get it.
02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.80 And so they help you lift it a little bit.
02:26:22.80 --> 02:26:23.80 They give you a little spot.
02:26:23.80 --> 02:26:25.000 So you're referencing weightlifting.
02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:26.000 Yes.
02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:27.000 But in this case.
02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000 That's how you get jacked.
02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:35.08 In this case, instead of weights, it's your slacker weakness.
02:26:35.08 --> 02:26:36.08 That might come.
02:26:36.08 --> 02:26:39.56 I'm not saying we're all weak, but sometimes some of us, a lot of us are sometimes.
02:26:39.56 --> 02:26:42.68 Anyway, Jocco's there for you, boom, psychological warfare.
02:26:42.68 --> 02:26:48.20 Also, if you work out boring, even if it's not boring, get more fitness gear.
02:26:48.20 --> 02:26:51.68 So I incorporated, okay, get it from on it on it.
02:26:51.68 --> 02:26:53.12 com slash jocco.
02:26:53.12 --> 02:26:59.88 Fitness gear, roll battle ropes, rings, kettlebells, of course.
02:26:59.88 --> 02:27:03.32 To me, if you don't have the kettlebells, I feel like there's like one little element.
02:27:03.32 --> 02:27:06.84 Big small, I don't know, depends on who you are, but there's one little element of
02:27:06.84 --> 02:27:07.84 life.
02:27:07.84 --> 02:27:08.84 That's missing.
02:27:08.84 --> 02:27:09.84 I'm not a big opinion.
02:27:09.84 --> 02:27:13.44 But when I got the rings, that changed my whole workout.
02:27:13.44 --> 02:27:18.40 So what I do, you know, you do a bunch of cool stuff on rings.
02:27:18.40 --> 02:27:19.72 I only do a handful of things.
02:27:19.72 --> 02:27:22.60 Actually, I don't even have like two, three things.
02:27:22.60 --> 02:27:26.60 One of the main ones are like, you know, when you, I make them go super low, like maybe
02:27:26.60 --> 02:27:30.36 waste, maybe handstand push ups and no bra.
02:27:30.36 --> 02:27:32.36 I'm still a beginner at the rings.
02:27:32.36 --> 02:27:35.08 But so I'll hold them in front of me and then I'll do it.
02:27:35.08 --> 02:27:37.28 It's kind of like a ab roller kind of thing.
02:27:37.28 --> 02:27:39.08 So it's one arm at a time or both arms.
02:27:39.08 --> 02:27:40.08 Both arms.
02:27:40.08 --> 02:27:42.52 And then sometimes I'll go like, why didn't you narrow whatever.
02:27:42.52 --> 02:27:43.52 So I'll do those.
02:27:43.52 --> 02:27:44.52 I'll do like sets of 10.
02:27:44.52 --> 02:27:46.04 And you can adjust like how high it's.
02:27:46.04 --> 02:27:47.80 So hard and easier it is, whatever.
02:27:47.80 --> 02:27:49.04 But I'll let me drop the ground.
02:27:49.04 --> 02:27:51.52 We can go to a full extension.
02:27:51.52 --> 02:27:52.88 You can't get there.
02:27:52.88 --> 02:27:53.88 I'm going to get there.
02:27:53.88 --> 02:27:59.56 Nonetheless, between every exercise, actually, no, between every set, you do a set of
02:27:59.56 --> 02:28:00.56 10.
02:28:00.56 --> 02:28:01.56 That's like the workout.
02:28:01.56 --> 02:28:03.32 Because it's not super exhausting to do it.
02:28:03.32 --> 02:28:05.80 You know, so it's like an active rest.
02:28:05.80 --> 02:28:09.92 Good man, I think it'll it'll take your like workout to the next.
02:28:09.92 --> 02:28:14.44 The thing people say that to the next level, that doesn't mean anything to the
02:28:14.44 --> 02:28:15.44 main.
02:28:15.44 --> 02:28:18.56 I guess even if it doesn't take it, if it takes to the will help you get jacked.
02:28:18.56 --> 02:28:23.80 Let me briefly explain what that means to the next level.
02:28:23.80 --> 02:28:29.60 So like when you do, I don't know dead lifts or I don't know shoulder pressure something.
02:28:29.60 --> 02:28:31.24 Like when you're.
02:28:31.24 --> 02:28:33.28 God is you can see curls.
02:28:33.28 --> 02:28:35.80 Oh, big to curls and try to get extension.
02:28:35.80 --> 02:28:38.96 When you do these things, you're like, since you're like, core, whatever is stronger.
02:28:38.96 --> 02:28:42.04 And this is just what I'm like, you feel when you, you're, of course, strong as feels
02:28:42.04 --> 02:28:43.76 like you have way better balance.
02:28:43.76 --> 02:28:47.88 You have like way better control of of the weight so you get stronger overall.
02:28:47.88 --> 02:28:48.88 Boom.
02:28:48.88 --> 02:28:50.20 Just just from rings.
02:28:50.20 --> 02:28:51.20 Yeah.
02:28:51.20 --> 02:28:55.68 Anyway, yeah, anyway, on it.com, that's where you get all this cool stuff.
02:28:55.68 --> 02:29:01.40 If you want to get your mind smarter and tougher and get your brain more jacked.
02:29:01.40 --> 02:29:11.48 We've got some books, Mike in the dragons, that is out.
02:29:11.48 --> 02:29:13.64 There are more being printed at this time.

02:29:19.68 --> 02:29:21.64 it to you.

02:29:32.72 --> 02:29:36.64 And thank you for posting the reviews on Amazon.
02:29:36.64 --> 02:29:39.80 That's so cool to read and see little pictures of kids reading the book.
02:29:39.80 --> 02:29:42.000 And I'm just super stoked on that book.
02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.56 So thank you for that and way the warrior kid for the kids.
02:29:44.56 --> 02:29:46.84 I don't know, maybe just a little bit older.
02:29:46.84 --> 02:29:50.68 That's a book about getting on the path for kids.
02:29:50.68 --> 02:29:57.88 And it's going to help them in every possible element of their life that I can think of
02:29:57.88 --> 02:29:59.12 right now.
02:29:59.12 --> 02:30:00.68 It will, it will help them.
02:30:00.68 --> 02:30:01.68 I think so.
02:30:01.68 --> 02:30:02.68 It'll make them smarter.
02:30:02.68 --> 02:30:04.12 It'll make them work harder.
02:30:04.12 --> 02:30:05.44 It'll make them understand discipline.
02:30:05.44 --> 02:30:07.12 It'll make them stronger.
02:30:07.12 --> 02:30:08.96 It'll just help them across the board.
02:30:08.96 --> 02:30:11.52 That's way the warrior kid and the follow on mission.
02:30:11.52 --> 02:30:16.20 The follow on book to that is way the warrior kid marks mission.
02:30:16.20 --> 02:30:19.04 The next is the discipline equals field.
02:30:19.04 --> 02:30:25.20 The discipline equals freedom field manual, which is a book about how to get after it.
02:30:25.20 --> 02:30:26.20 Yeah.
02:30:26.20 --> 02:30:27.20 The book.
02:30:27.20 --> 02:30:28.80 It's the book about how to get.
02:30:28.80 --> 02:30:30.60 It is not a throw away.
02:30:30.60 --> 02:30:31.60 A book by any stretch.
02:30:31.60 --> 02:30:32.60 No.
02:30:32.60 --> 02:30:33.60 It is.
02:30:33.60 --> 02:30:35.60 How would you describe it?
02:30:35.60 --> 02:30:36.60 I mean, annual.
02:30:36.60 --> 02:30:38.60 It's a manual, but I mean, instrument.
02:30:38.60 --> 02:30:41.60 No, what's the word you used earlier?
02:30:41.60 --> 02:30:42.60 Esthetically.
02:30:42.60 --> 02:30:43.60 Esthetically.
02:30:43.60 --> 02:30:53.16 Could you possibly look, just look, the external part, just the cover of the field manual
02:30:53.16 --> 02:30:55.16 and think maybe I'll do a little extra work today.
02:30:55.16 --> 02:30:56.16 Yes.
02:30:56.16 --> 02:30:57.16 That is entirely possible.
02:30:57.16 --> 02:30:58.16 Yeah.
02:30:58.16 --> 02:31:01.72 Was you know what's in it?
02:31:01.72 --> 02:31:03.72 Get after it material.
02:31:03.72 --> 02:31:04.72 Yeah.
02:31:04.72 --> 02:31:10.08 And I was thinking about this too, not extensive thought, but there's an audio version of this.
02:31:10.08 --> 02:31:11.08 True.
02:31:11.08 --> 02:31:12.08 True.
02:31:12.08 --> 02:31:13.60 Which is cool, which is good.
02:31:13.60 --> 02:31:16.36 But it's kind of like one of those things where you kind of like, man, I kind of want
02:31:16.36 --> 02:31:17.36 the physical book.
02:31:17.36 --> 02:31:24.12 Even if I'm more of an audio book person, I want that physical book because of it's
02:31:24.12 --> 02:31:25.92 aesthetics heavy.
02:31:25.92 --> 02:31:26.92 It's heavy.
02:31:26.92 --> 02:31:27.92 It has black pages.
02:31:27.92 --> 02:31:28.92 Let's just put it to you.
02:31:28.92 --> 02:31:29.92 That.
02:31:29.92 --> 02:31:30.92 Let's start with that.
02:31:30.92 --> 02:31:31.92 Have you ever seen a book with black pages?
02:31:31.92 --> 02:31:32.92 No, you haven't.
02:31:32.92 --> 02:31:33.92 No.
02:31:33.92 --> 02:31:34.92 Get the field manual right there.
02:31:34.92 --> 02:31:38.92 If you do want the audio version, then it's on iTunes, Amazon, and music, Google Play.
02:31:38.92 --> 02:31:45.92 It's not on audible because I wanted you to be able to use it as a alarm.
02:31:45.92 --> 02:31:47.92 Some of those things, little warnings.
02:31:47.92 --> 02:31:48.92 Yeah.
02:31:48.92 --> 02:31:50.48 Tracks ready to be played at a moment's notice.
02:31:50.48 --> 02:31:51.48 Yeah.
02:31:51.48 --> 02:31:55.12 And that's the thing too, where if you time, if you set up a timer, where when you were
02:31:55.12 --> 02:31:57.72 going to lunch, sugarcooked,
02:31:57.72 --> 02:31:59.72 or a recorded live play, you can check.
02:31:59.72 --> 02:32:03.20 Oh, man, perfect example.
02:32:03.20 --> 02:32:07.24 Because the thing is, some of these chapters or whatever, you're going to identify with
02:32:07.24 --> 02:32:09.24 more than the next chapter.
02:32:09.24 --> 02:32:15.40 Especially if you like donuts or pasteries, the sugarcooked live is one.
02:32:15.40 --> 02:32:17.72 You're going to be referencing that a little bit more, right?
02:32:17.72 --> 02:32:18.72 So we're sick.
02:32:18.72 --> 02:32:19.72 Okay.
02:32:19.72 --> 02:32:20.72 So you have that option now.
02:32:20.72 --> 02:32:22.72 That's good to put it on the timer.
02:32:22.72 --> 02:32:23.72 Good.
02:32:23.72 --> 02:32:24.72 Check.
02:32:24.72 --> 02:32:25.72 Yeah.
02:32:25.72 --> 02:32:28.72 Next book is, well, I'll talk about two books together.
02:32:28.72 --> 02:32:30.72 Extreme ownership and dichotomy and leadership.
02:32:30.72 --> 02:32:34.72 These are two books about the lessons learned on the battlefield.
02:32:34.72 --> 02:32:37.72 Myself and Lave Babin wrote the books.
02:32:37.72 --> 02:32:42.72 He was in task, you know, bruiser as the Charlie Patoon commander.
02:32:42.72 --> 02:32:45.72 And we took the lessons that we learned over there.
02:32:45.72 --> 02:32:46.72 We brought him back.
02:32:46.72 --> 02:32:49.72 We started teaching them to the seals that were getting ready to deploy.
02:32:49.72 --> 02:32:51.72 And we wrote extreme ownership.
02:32:51.72 --> 02:32:54.72 When we got out and started working with companies and saw that all the lessons that we learned.
02:32:54.72 --> 02:32:58.72 Transferred to the civilian sector.
02:32:58.72 --> 02:33:06.72 And then we wrote the dichotomy leadership as a follow-on book, which some people are saying is better.
02:33:06.72 --> 02:33:08.72 I don't know which one is better.
02:33:08.72 --> 02:33:11.72 But I do know that they will make you better.
