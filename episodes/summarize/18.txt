Mobility is also important and being able to move well and move smoothly, you know, there's that whole, I don't know if it's a trend going on right now, but this idea of movement training, you know, it's the same thing, you know, how, how are you going to move? yeah, you know, we, we don't eat, but we like to research and look into it and before I could really finish the sentence, I was going to say we, I like to look into all the programs that we donate to or think or consider donating to before I could finish the sound right when I finished the sentence. I was right behind the cutoff point, you know, they're like boom and the guy ahead of me gets through and he, you know, one guy ahead of me gets turned away. You know, and, I don't know, it seems like your joints kind of get rigid for it to be stronger, right? You know, was there people who would be, you could tell they were showing off to be like first, you know? You know, work the bicep and the same thing with the with the triceps and the same thing with all these, you know, movements that I kind of pretend to blow off because they're not full body, multi-joint movements, which is sort of the gospel of strength and conditioning. Yeah, and when I say go hard, I mean, like the muscular, you know, destroy, like if you can do squats until you can't walk, you can't do that all the time. You know, it's, you know, that the, I mean, another rehearsal would be like a, we work with a gas oil industry. Yeah, but for the most part, but they're not going to do this weird yo, you know how like some guys are, they're like double jointed or something. And the other of coming out of bonds and they're like, hey, you know, hey, you know, hey, come here. I'm talking about dealing with your boss or whoever think about using instead of thinking about, hey, I'm going to, you know, smash this person in the face and that's going to bring me the win. You know, as using things that didn't have any weight because I could do all that, but the minute I put weight on my back, you know, anything above body weight, it started to hurt. And it, you know, I think with one of the things that's, I think, I like me, I need more focus on that, because I don't do enough mobility work. And I would, you know, guys are, because you know, we're working hard during the day or during the night. but yeah, pushing too far seems kind of weird because like, yeah, let's say I don't know, you can stretch your shoulder way behind your back. Because until you know what war is like, or at least until you open your mind to understand what it is, where it comes from, what it does to people, then that's a whole, it's a whole part of humanity that you're not seeing. If you get into the take down that element, though, that, Yeah, but even if you want to, yeah, I'll be hard on your back, but even to take down elements, you know, if you're just going to do pure take downs, I think once you start putting your arms, you know, backwards upside down and behind in between your legs and then back up again, I think you're going to have issues with that. You know, so so if, let's say someone who's, you know, he's worked in office or whatever, he wants to lose some weight. And Eddie Bravo actually said this in a way where you know, little kids like little babies two years old. You know, you don't have a day or two days to, you know, analyze and make a decision. It's good to have that well roundedness, but you definitely want to use, you know, you definitely want to have a good ground game. And you think, oh, if I put all my force behind this small point of impact, man, that's really going to, you know, hurt somebody and take them down. And they're going to, you know, I'm going to put these, these things into the fitness ebook. And you know what, if you're a police officer out there or you're in law enforcement, then you know, Hannah, that's great. So I was just doing, you know, pistols and, you know, air squats, jumps and box jumps. That's actually, you know, Eddie Bravo, who's in GJ2, if you don't know what that is, GJ2, Blackbelt, really creative game. So even you know, a good example was was like our breach team, which is the team that kind of goes in to blow up a door. I could be wrong, but I feel suspect of my training methodology because I hadn't done curls in a long, long time because you know, you're thinking, hey, why would I do curls when I could do cleans, right?
