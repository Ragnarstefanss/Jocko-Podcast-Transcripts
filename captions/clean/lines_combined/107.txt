00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 107 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo.
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:22.000 Good evening. So the battle of I-Drain Valley was over for now. And we just spent two podcasts talking about it.
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.000 And one of the things that you forget sometimes about the military is that the machine rolls on. The machine rolls on.
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.000 There's a work to do and it doesn't. It doesn't matter what you've been through or what you experienced or how many men or friends or leaders you lost.
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:56.000 The machine is going to roll on. There's still work to do at least it's going to try and roll on. And that means normal things are going to continue to happen. Meaning that people are going to get reassigned.
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:08.000 People are going to leave the army. People are going to retire. People are going to transfer. You don't stay together. You don't stay together with these guys that you just went through whatever you went through with.
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000 And as much as you might feel like a family with that group of guys, you're not going to get treated like a family in the military.
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:27.000 It's the machine is going to roll on. And with that mind to close out the book, we were soldiers once and young.
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:43.000 That again was covered in podcast 105 and 106. I'm going to read one more passage from that book. And here we go back to the book every morning during those final bittersweet days of my command of the first Battalion 7th Cavalry.
00:01:43.000 --> 00:02:01.000 The original version of Major Plumley would appear with a group of men bound for the airfield and the plane that would take them home for discharge. Specialist for Pat Selich of the recon platoon says, Colonel Moore shook our hands and said thank you.
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:15.000 I was the second or third guy he spoke to and he had tears in his eyes. I remember what he said. I see that you're married. You have a wedding ring on.
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000 Just go home. Pick up the pieces and start your life all over again.
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:32.000 Then basically that's what I did. I came home to a wonderful wife tried to readjust did a decent job at it. I did what Colonel Moore said.
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:45.000 I tried to put the war behind me. I served. I did my job. I came home. I didn't ask for anything. No fanfare, no parades.
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:56.000 I went back to work back to school and did my best. He might be a general, but he still Colonel Moore to me.
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:07.000 If it wasn't for him and all his knowledge and training, I don't think any of us would have survived the I-Drain Valley.
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:20.000 On Tuesday, November 23rd, the day came for me to turn over command. For the change of command, I requested a full battalion formation with officers front and center, the division band,
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:36.000 the line, honors to the reviewing officer and colors, and then pass in review. Reminiscent of our weekly retreat parades back at Fort Bending. I requested that captain to directs Bravo Company 2nd Battalion 7th Cavalry,
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:49.000 and Lieutenant Sissons Poutoon of Alpha Company 2nd of the 7th being included in the parade of 1st Battalion 7th Cavalry in token of the fact that they fought bravely alongside us in the battle at X-ray.
00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:06.000 And so it was. The band played Colonel Bogey and the Washington Post March and Gary Owen. General Kanard pinned on my eagles and I spoke briefly and with deep emotion.
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:22.000 Speck for Ray Turner of Alpha Company 1st Battalion said, we stood in formation with some units hardly having enough men to form up. Colonel Howe Moore spoke to us and he cried.
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:38.000 At that moment he could have let us back into the eyedring. We were soldiers. We were fighting men and those of us who were left had the utmost love and respect for our Colonel and for one another.
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:58.000 As I reflect on those three days in November I remember many heroes but no cowards. I learned what value life really had. We all lost friends but the bravery they showed on the battlefield.
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:27.000 We live forever. Well, we have tried here to remember and display and spread the word on some of that bravery that was shown on the battlefield so that it does live on.
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:40.000 And I think that is the least we can do.
00:05:40.000 --> 00:06:00.000 That in learn. Try and learn. We must always try and learn and we can certainly learn from a man that had been through so much and was so respected and revered by his man and so today we're going to delve into another book.
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:15.000 And this one is actually by general Howe Moore and Co-written by another Army vet, younger Army vet, another author, Mike Gordia.
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:31.000 And the book is called How Moore on Leadership and it's just that. It's principles and thoughts about leadership that how Moore learned and then implemented throughout his life and his career.
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:50.000 And again, if you haven't listened to podcast 105 and 106 yet go back and listen to those podcasts first because I don't give you some context as to what general Moore live through and why we should pay attention to what he has to say.
00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:06.000 So again, the book is How Moore on Leadership, the subtitle is winning, win outgunned and outman kicks off in the prologue it says, all of one's life is a learning experience.
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:28.000 I learned a lot of lessons along the way I'm still learning. These are values, principles, lessons I've learned mistakes, successes and my thoughts on leadership from watching, studying and reading about leaders and action. Good leaders, mediocre leaders and bad leaders.
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:39.000 So he wrote this book, this book only came out. I actually have to check. It came out very, came out in 2017.
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:53.000 So this book is at the end of How Moore's Life. And here we go. We're going to jump right into some of these principles. He starts off with four basic principles of leadership.
00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:03.000 Principle number one, three strikes and you're not out in the game of baseball, three strikes and you're out, not so in the game of life, three strikes and you're not out.
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:13.000 There are two things a leader can do. He can either contaminate his environment and his people with his attitude and actions or he can inspire confidence.
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:24.000 Good point. There's always another way in life, right? Three strikes, four strikes. You can keep swinging. There's no empire to call you out.
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:36.000 Back to the book, he must have and display the will to prevail. By his actions, his words, his tone of voice, his appearances, demeanor, his countenance and the looking, his eyes.
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:45.000 He must never give off any hint or evidence that he is uncertain about a positive outcome.
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:56.000 So that's something that we saw in action in the book. We were soldiers once and young when Rick or Skola comes up and says, where they at good. I hope they bring it everything they got to.
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:07.000 Just even though inside he admitted he was worried, but and then you hear the reactions of the other guys, they were saying, well, that's good. At least this guy's in the game. Look, I'm game. If he's game, let's go.
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000 Yeah.
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000 Do you think that that could elicit some sort of a blowback?
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000 I'm definitely that that it definitely will. In fact, I have my note there. You want to see my note right there? So can you read that?
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000 It says really.
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:28.000 Because it's one of those things for sure. You're right. And if you roll in and you're getting smashed and you show, you can you can see my bliviest.
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:44.000 Yeah, yeah, exactly. He addresses that stand by. Here we go back to the book. It struck me early in my reading and school and later in life that is a common theme running through books and stories about great leaders was their positive outlook, positive mental attitude, PMA.
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:57.000 For all those bad brains, friends out there. They were aware of the pitfalls. They were, this is your point. They were aware of the pitfalls and negatives, but they refused to fret and worry about them.
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000 So there you go. We're not talking like, oh, this isn't happening over there. Like, remember a Baghdad Bob, are you old enough to remember that?
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:13.000 Yeah, but I think you mentioned that. Yeah, Baghdad Bob, while tanks were just while the Iraqi army was getting obliterated in the first Gulf War.
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:20.000 He was sitting there going, oh, yes, we've had many victories. You know, you're just completely oblivious to what was happening.
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000 Yeah, and there's literally, I think there was literally like bombs going off in the background.
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:38.000 Yeah, Baghdad Bob. Okay, here we go. Back to the book. Principle number two, there's always one more thing you can do to influence any situation in your favor.
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:52.000 And after that, there's one more thing. And after that, there's one more thing. And after that one more thing. The one more things you do, the more one more things you do, the better your chances are for achieving success in any situation.
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000 Elite, this is interesting.
00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:07.000 A leader must create time to detach himself mentally and ask, what am I doing that I should not be doing and what am I not doing that I should be doing to influence the situation in my favor.
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000 So he's talking about detachment.
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000 I agree with him. Clearly.
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000 Yeah, that's a good. It's good to have those like specific things to ask yourself when you detach.
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000 You know how like, oh, I always ask myself like, okay, what do we have here? But even that, that's like a broad question.
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000 That's too broad. Yeah, that's like, that's way better. That's good.
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000 Yeah, if you think about, if you think about your life,
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000 yeah. And you view constantly saying like, what, what should I be doing right now?
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000 Yeah. And what should I not be doing? We're all doing things that we should not be doing, right?
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000 Yeah, well, yeah, not me, but yeah, man. Oh, you're just perfect. Perfect.
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000 So we're all doing things that we, we know we shouldn't be doing. And we're all know that there's things that we should be doing that we're not.
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000 So detach, look yourself, do an assessment.
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000 Yeah. I'm sure that's like a gold mine of things you can change right there for sure.
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000 Here's a, here he says, a leader is paid to do three things. Get the job done and get it done well.
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000 Plan ahead, be proactive, not reactive exercise.
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000 Good sound judgment and doing all the above.
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.000 To get the job done, the leader must have a clearly defined mission along with specific goals and objectives.
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000 So there you go. Brand and pick worth hit me up.
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:34.000 Sure. Because the last podcast I was talking about goals and he had sent me a text about getting belts.
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000 I think it was about getting belts in GJ2. And I think that's what it was.
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000 But anyways, he was basically calling me a hypocrite.
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000 Because you know, my, my, my thing is like, hey, you trained to get better. You don't train because you want this thing, right?
00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:02.000 You train because you, you have a, I should say it's not that it's not that there's no goal there. But your goal is different. Your goal is in a material item of cloth.
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000 Yeah. Your goal is to get better at your jitz or Brandon.
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000 Yeah. You're on lockdown.
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:15.000 You're here a very seemingly far fetched analogy to that, but it's not so the other night I was,
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000 It's making arts and crafts.
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000 We went on with press. We just chill out and out. Do it.
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:38.000 And then she laughed at her. No, no, she said a joke. And then I laughed.
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000 And then she said, I'm going to say this joke again in laugh again, just like what you did before.
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:53.000 So I'm like, so I thought about that. Of course I did it, but week story went last right there.
00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:00.000 But so she says it. I do it right. And then I'm thinking like, isn't that interesting? She got the laugh and that was a big payoff.
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.000 But here's the thing in a way she shouldn't be focusing on the laugh. She should be focusing on saying funny jokes.
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000 The laugh just goes before. Would you take it easy?
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000 No, I did it. Tell her that in school, but you see them saying the same thing.
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000 Juditzi, you focus on getting better at juditzi. The belt will come as a result.
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000 A little bi-product if you will. Just like the laughs.
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000 So when you're telling jokes, go for the funnyness. Not for the laugh.
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000 I'll talk to pressing. I'll pull her aside. Have a little chat with her.
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000 Or maybe Brandon Pickworth, you know, maybe he, you know, find that very enlightening.
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000 Just saying. Tighten him up.
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000 He did by the way. He did do his 100 burpees and sub 10 minutes. He actually got it. I feel it was time was.
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000 Yeah, I never went back there to do that man.
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000 Didn't you get it easily?
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000 You do it easily? I did it. It depends on the way mean by easily.
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000 You did it or not.
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000 I did it.
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000 I did it with the.
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000 Did you have minutes to spare?
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000 I had a minute to spare.
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000 If I remember correctly, I had one minute to spare.
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000 And I knew that at the last.
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000 So I coasted.
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000 Yeah, I coasted into the finish line week.
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000 It was still kind of.
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000 I was sore the next day. I was actually sore.
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000 Really. Yeah.
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000 Brandon won his video. He did good burpees. I'll give him that much credit.
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000 Better burpees than my normal burpees for sure.
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000 Okay.
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:22.000 Yeah.
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000 His burpees look.
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000 They look clean.
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000 Yeah.
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:25.000 So mine.
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000 They didn't merit like 12 minutes.
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000 But he got that down.
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000 Yeah.
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:30.000 Yeah.
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000 If you would have saw my burpees and said, hey, those aren't full.
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000 All of those aren't full burpees.
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000 I would not be surprised. Put it that way.
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000 Just still.
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000 Really.
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000 All right.
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000 Going back to the book.
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000 The smart leader should always think through the
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000 What ifs and have a plan on how to handle them before they occur?
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000 Time so spent is never wasted.
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000 Things do not always go as planned.
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000 So again, he talks a bunch about planning and he's like,
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000 That's not what I'm going to plan.
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000 And we all have to remember that.
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000 The smart leader must also be mindful of his organization's
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000 constraints and center of gravity.
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000 There can be one or several constraints that inhibit getting the job done.
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000 And I think we all kind of understand that.
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000 And he says that the constraints must accurately be defined.
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000 But the center of gravity idea was was a little bit more interesting to me.
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000 Here we go to the book.
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000 The center of gravity is the principal thing or activity that must be in balance or
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000 under control for an organization to operate.
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000 It is the organization's source of strength.
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000 In addition to understanding your own center of gravity to protect it,
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000 you must recognize and attack your enemies or competitor center of gravity
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000 to defeat them.
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000 And that battle in Vietnam.
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000 My center of gravity was the landing zones we've talked about.
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000 The hydrangea Valley in the new that and locked that thing down and fought hard for it.
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000 Dean.
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000 I was training with Dean.
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000 I don't know a few months ago.
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000 And then he was teaching a class.
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000 And one thing he said that was really interesting and really smart about
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000 J2 is he's like, hey, when you're on the ground, you can't have your balance attack.
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000 Meaning if you're on the bottom, you can't have your body already on it down there.
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000 So you have to mess with the person's balance on top.
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000 Because if they can't mess with your balance, because you're already down there,
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000 you need to mess with their balance.
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000 Good point.
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000 Yeah.
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000 Exactly.
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000 It's one of those things.
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000 Yeah.
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000 There's a lot to that.
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000 Yeah.
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000 There's a lot to that.
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000 Interesting is like, now you're, because you're talking about like a really deep fundamental concept.
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000 One thing to do.
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000 For sure.
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000 And a lot of times we don't learn all of them, you know, we injudiate to it.
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000 Obviously in life too, but we don't learn all the fundamental concepts.
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000 So even you can go through life and be successful, you know, varying levels.
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000 And then get introduced to one fundamental concept that'll just like,
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000 Dane, that's something that you know, I know we all know.
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000 You did you do to you know that if you're on the bottom, you got to sweep it on top.
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000 You know that you, but what he was, he wasn't even saying sweep.
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000 Yeah.
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000 He was saying you have to, you have to attack their balance.
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000 Yeah.
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000 Because you can't have your balance tacked because you're on the ground or right?
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000 Yeah.
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000 You attack their balance.
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000 And it's just going to open things up.
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000 He wasn't talking, you're going to sweep every time.
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000 No, you're not.
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000 You're going to get the arm lock though.
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000 You're going to get a position change.
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000 You're going to get roll them into a heel hook, right?
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000 Yeah.
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000 But it's interesting when he talks it like when, when how more general more here's talking about.
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000 Not only do you have to know your center of gravity.
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000 You got to know your opponents center of gravity.
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000 So that's what you attack, which is interesting.
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000 Because people would most heavily defend their center of gravity.
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000 You would think.
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:38.000 And therefore, it would be counter to the sun's super principle of don't attack the heavily guarded area.
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000 But, or heavily defended area.
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000 But you got to find a way to get through to their center of gravity.
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000 Otherwise, you're not going to put them off balance, you're not going to win.
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000 Yeah.
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000 Like, that's one of the goals.
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000 You know, it's to attack that.
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000 Because some people, I mean, even because the inter totally clarified the concept for you.
00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000 Yeah.
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000 Whereas, like, this is going on in the game.
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:01.000 Yeah.
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000 And, you know, maybe, maybe in certain circumstances intuitive, like, okay, I'm going to attack this guys balance.
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000 Because specifically, I'm going for a specific sweep or whatever,
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000 maybe it'll come in and out of your mind.
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000 But if you have that clear in your mind, that that's part of this whole game that we're playing.
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000 Yeah. And go back to the sun suit.
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000 Well, just because this is me figuring out right now is just because you're attacking their center of gravity.
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000 Doesn't mean you have to do a frontal assault on it.
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000 It's still fine.
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:27.000 Exactly.
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000 Even, I mean, yeah.
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000 But now, at the end of the day, now that's part of my goal.
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000 You know, my goal isn't just to kill everyone.
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:34.000 Yeah.
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000 Or whatever.
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000 It's like, okay, we're going to attack this center of gravity specifically.
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000 Because that'll open up.
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000 But everything else that comes with it.
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000 But it's clarified now.
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000 It is.
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000 Back to the book.
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000 While getting the job done, the leader must plan ahead and create the future.
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000 He must be proactive, not reactive.
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000 Truly great leaders have a cutie.
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000 Our perceptive, aggressive, enthusiastic, concede trends.
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000 Analyze them carefully and correctly.
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000 Have a vision.
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000 Have confidence in it.
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000 And can inspire and motivate himself and as people to make it happen.
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000 That's a big laundry list of things for a leader to be doing.
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000 That's why leaders.
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000 That's why leadership is a hard job.
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000 Think about all those things I just rattled off.
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000 He must have a positive attitude and must hate the word no.
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000 He must have smart, well-trained people to run day-to-day activities.
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000 He must check up on them and make sure the job is getting done while he stacks the deck for future success.
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000 So you can see right now he's not micro-managing.
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000 He's getting people that can do the job and then he's looking forward.
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000 Principle number three, when nothing is wrong, there's nothing wrong.
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000 Except there's nothing wrong.
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000 That's when a leader has to be most alert.
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000 Complacency kills.
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000 Leaders are paid to create order out of chaos.
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000 History is replete with examples of leaders who failed because they became too complacent.
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000 In the days and months leading up to Pearl Harbor,
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000 American military leaders were confident that the Japanese could never strike American soil.
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000 Our naval intelligence said that Pearl Harbor was too far out of reach for Japanese naval task force.
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000 They were also convinced the Harbor was too shallow for a torpedo attack.
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000 Instead of prioritizing the threat from an aggressive naval enemy,
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:24.000 the Army Air Corps commander at Wheeler and Hickham Fields put a higher priority on the threat from spies and saboteurs.
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:34.000 They grouped the planes together at the airfield to make them easier for walking centuries to guard on foot patrol.
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000 But when the Japanese bombers arrived on December 7, the cluster-demeric and planes became turkey shoot targets.
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000 Didn't know that.
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000 Didn't know that.
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000 Wrong threat assessment.
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000 And now you're doing something that's actually going to help your enemy's real attack.
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000 But it's complacency.
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000 Principle number four. Trust your instincts.
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:08.000 Instincts are the product of one's personality, experience, reading and education.
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000 That's interesting, right?
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000 He puts reading in there.
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000 You're actually getting experience reading and you'll all said that.
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000 General Mattis.
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000 General Mattis. He reads.
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:24.000 I think he has a personal book collection of like 5,000 or 7,000 books, personal book collection.
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000 Okay.
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:33.000 And he said he that's to prevent him from being surprised because if you know history, you know the future.
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:43.000 But that's a great definition of what instinct is because people think instinct is this something that's mysterious thing, right?
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000 But no, it's your personality, experience, reading and education.
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.000 Yeah, as far as the context he's putting in, I mean instinct obviously is clearly defined as something else.
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000 What is it clearly defined as?
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000 I didn't say I knew.
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000 Oh, okay.
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000 No, no, you know how animals have instincts to, oh yeah, we have instincts to procreate.
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000 Like all this stuff.
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000 I mean obviously he's talking about a specific concept.
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000 Yeah, he's not talking about the instinct to procreate.
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000 No, no, no, something else.
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000 But I'm saying, you know what I mean.
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000 It's not that is mystical.
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000 Yes, his definition is not mystical.
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000 Yeah.
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000 Like, hey, read, learn, experience.
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000 Yeah, and then yeah, so you know, like how, you know, you're gut feeling kind of thing.
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000 So yeah, it's made like if you don't have any experience in any, like you're not really nothing.
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000 Yeah.
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000 And you know, you're not going to have many gut instincts.
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000 No, you still have this.
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000 Yeah, it's gonna be way off.
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:42.000 And then if I was talking about this with someone when sometimes like with an injury, let's say, you have an injury.
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000 And you think I'll just do this.
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000 But what you're doing is actually completely wrong.
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000 Yeah.
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000 That happens to me sometimes.
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000 Yeah.
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000 I'll have an injury and I'll say, you know what, I'll just keep stretching it.
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:53.000 Yeah.
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000 It hurts a little bit, but it'll be okay.
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000 I think that's helping it.
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000 And I'm just wrong.
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000 Yeah.
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000 Just to battle you wrong.
00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000 Yeah.
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000 And then so let's say you were, you did that just over and over.
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000 Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000 Which you probably have.
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000 But I'm saying normal person, you do it over.
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000 Then the instincts will kind of recalibrate itself.
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000 And yeah, because eventually I go ahead, this doesn't work.
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000 Yeah.
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000 And now my instinct becomes a demobilized that broken wing or whatever.
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000 Yeah.
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000 Exactly.
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000 Check.
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000 Just like if you don't know,
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000 Do you get to get into a fight with someone who does,
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000 No, you're just going to do your instincts.
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000 Yeah.
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000 You know, which is nothing.
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:29.000 Yeah.
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000 By the way, and your instincts are going to be completely wrong.
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000 Completely wrong.
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000 But you do, you push this guy off me.
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000 Yeah.
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000 Exactly.
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000 I'll power out of this.
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000 Oh, you know, I'll go all super hard.
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000 Well, that's a great example.
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000 Yeah.
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000 And then when you learn to get to recalibrate your instincts now.
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000 Now your instincts are good.
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000 Yeah.
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000 And proper.
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000 Unless you get one of these tricky guys who knows your instincts.
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000 So he's going to base his instincts off your instincts.
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000 Yeah.
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000 And I'm going to get an administrative.
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000 Yeah.
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000 That's true.
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000 All right.
00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000 Back to the book.
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000 It's a nice talking about instinct.
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:08.000 It's a kind of six sense when seconds count instincts and decisiveness come into play in quick developing
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000 situations.
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000 The leader must act fast in part confidence to all around him.
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000 Must not second guess a decision make it happen.
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000 In the process, he cannot stand around slack jawed when he's hit with the unexpected.
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000 He must face up to the facts and deal with them and move on.
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000 When my head tells me to do one thing and my gut tells me to do another,
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000 I will always go with my gut.
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000 Why?
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000 Because my gut, because my gut as I've learned is rarely wrong.
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000 Now that's that's a bold statement right there.
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000 Yeah.
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000 You got to.
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000 If my instinct are telling me one thing and my brain is telling me something else,
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000 that is to me that's time to reassess what's going on.
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000 Because I got some conflicting things happening.
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000 Yeah.
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000 I don't want because I'm fairly logical in thinking through things.
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000 And if that is getting completely countered by just some emotional feeling,
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000 which kind of that's what an instinct is right.
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000 That can be.
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000 My name be.
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000 It can be emotional.
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000 Yeah.
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:14.000 Right.
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000 So you got to watch out for it.
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000 Yeah.
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000 It seems like in an emotion or an situation predicated on emotion strongly,
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000 like a, I don't know, relationship with somebody.
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000 Yeah.
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000 I'm just going to go with my, in this case, that your gut's your heart.
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000 Yeah.
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000 Yeah.
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000 I'm going to go with my gut.
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000 Yeah.
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000 You're wrong.
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000 No.
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000 No.
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000 No.
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000 You're probably wrong.
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000 No.
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000 Think about it.
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000 Think about it.
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000 Logical side.
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000 Yeah.
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000 Back to the book.
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.000 Instinct is a kind of caution light and early warning or a gut feeling,
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000 which can an occasion result in a far better decision than one based on a logical
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000 process.
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000 One rule of thumb.
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000 I learned more than 60 years ago.
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000 If there's a doubt in your mind, there's no doubt at all.
00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000 In other words, if you know in your heart that an action is wrong, don't do it.
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000 One of my sons calls this the rule of doubts above all.
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000 Never try to fake out, deceive or fool the people under you.
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000 Not only is it wrong, but the troops can smell BS from miles away.
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000 Hmm.
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000 See, let's start to make more sense if it's something that's wrong.
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000 Yeah.
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000 That'll make it a lot of sense.
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000 Yeah.
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000 But it makes a lot of sense.
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000 Rather than right.
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000 The way I heard what hear this in the teams, I didn't know it came from West Point,
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000 but they'd say if there is a doubt, then there is no doubt, which I guess is the same thing, which is just shorter.
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000 If there is a doubt, then there is no doubt.
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000 And that means what?
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000 Like if there's any doubt, then there's no doubt that it's wrong.
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000 Yes.
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000 That's what you're saying.
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000 Or if you're saying wait, I don't know if this is the right thing to do.
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000 It's probably not.
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000 Probably not.
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000 Hmm.
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:58.000 Yeah, instincts.
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000 Like when ducks fly south for the winter, wait, is it snorke or south?
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000 They fly south for the winter, yeah, yeah.
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000 That's an instinct.
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000 But I don't know what that is.
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000 Is that an instinct?
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000 Yeah.
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000 Yeah.
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:09.000 Straight up.
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:16.000 Just like if you're baby, like suckling, you know, so you can feed that's instinct.
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000 Interesting.
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000 Let's see.
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000 Back to the book.
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000 Back to the book.
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000 The discipline that makes an effective leader begins in the home.
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000 In most cases, learning comes through observation and experience.
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:39.000 It is through the parents and or legal guardians where we first begin to understand right from wrong and success or failure.
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:46.000 In having guidelines and expectations set before me as a young boy, having to tow the line was the standard of every day.
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.000 While I remember my mother and father requiring discipline and proper conduct, there was an equal balance of love,
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000 fun, fishing, reading, religion and daydreaming.
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000 Yes, daydreaming.
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000 Discipline.
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000 Cool.
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:12.000 Daydreaming makes sense, but you don't automatically associate that with discipline.
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000 No, you don't.
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000 But if you follow your daydreams all the time, then you won't end up with anything.
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000 So you have to have them both.
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000 Yeah.
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000 Next one.
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000 No job is ever beneath you.
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:33.000 In whatever you do, do it to the best of your abilities.
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000 Next, the best leaders strive to create a family environment within their organization.
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000 A good leader aims to make his subordinates feel that they are valued members of a team.
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:52.000 The same loyalty that goes up the chain of command must also go down the chain of command and across the network of subordinates.
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000 And by the way, of course, as always, I'm not reading this whole book.
00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000 There's all kinds of better detail in the book itself and explanations.
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000 And I'm hitting the wave tops, as they say.
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000 I like this one a little bit.
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000 The first person you have to lead in discipline is yourself.
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.000 Good versus poor choices make all the difference in the world.
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000 Conquer.
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000 Back to the book.
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000 To be a leader, you must be willing to be a lifelong learner.
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:32.000 The leaders who fail are those who think they know everything, or that they have nothing left to learn.
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000 They resent having to learn something new or adapt to a new situation.
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000 Gotta be humble.
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000 This is interesting.
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000 I like to do a lot of listening.
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000 That way I pick up a lot of good ideas many from subordinates.
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000 When you listen, you note twice as much as the other guy.
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000 What he knows and what you know.
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000 Just also, whenever the boss talked, I not only listened, but I took notes.
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000 I still carry three by five cards today.
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000 That's a great one.
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000 If you let someone else talk, I was doing security detail.
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000 And I racked my first deployment over there.
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000 And we picked up a high ranking officer.
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000 And we were the security detail form.
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000 And he was picking up some subordinate officers along the way.
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000 And it was so interesting how this high ranking officer,
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:37.000 depending on who got in the vehicle, because we met with multiple different subordinate officers of his.
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000 And this is the American guy.
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000 What's that?
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000 Oh yeah, these are all Americans.
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000 But this senior officer, he would barely say anything.
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000 And the guys would get in and you could hear them.
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000 You know, at first they sort of listened for a minute and they couldn't handle it.
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000 So they just start talking.
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000 And they tell the boss everything.
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000 It's a great technique.
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000 You just set their quietly and you need people are spilling their guts.
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000 Yeah, he sent that in negotiation for sure.
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000 For sure.
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000 Yeah, where you just don't see anything.
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000 Just don't see anything.
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000 Yeah, it can make people want to come from them.
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000 Yeah.
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000 But that's a great way of looking at it.
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000 When you talk, you're, and that same thing happens in any situation.
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000 I've said it before on this podcast.
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000 The more you talk, the less people listen.
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000 Yeah.
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000 Just the way it is.
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000 He had a kind of some challenges getting into West Point.
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000 And he did get in and he had a couple lessons learned from that.
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000 Never say no to yourself when you need to ask for something.
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000 Make the other guy say no.
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000 That's, that's a good point, right?
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000 Like I'm not just going to say, I'll echo would never say yes to this.
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000 So I'm just going to not going to ask him.
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000 No, I'm going to ask him.
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000 Echo, can you make a couple more videos?
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000 Yeah.
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000 Worst thing you can do is say no, which is likely.
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000 Yeah.
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000 Forget if I read this or listening to it, but there's two kinds of askers.
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000 People who ask for stuff, right?
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000 These two kinds.
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000 One who thinks like that, where is like, the worst they can say is no.
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000 So my last or the second kind who's like, he, you know, he might say no.
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000 But I, you know how like some people, I don't know if you're like this.
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000 Maybe you're, I don't know.
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000 But some people they're uncomfortable when to like saying no to someone.
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000 Like it's like you're the bad guy.
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000 I'm kind of like, hey, can you retweet this charity or something like that?
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000 Yeah.
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000 And if you say no, you're the bad guy.
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000 And that's an excuse, for example, of course.
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000 But the people are like that.
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000 But some people, if they're, I forget the name of the asker.
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000 But if you're the kind of asker that's like, oh, the worst they could say no.
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000 If you're that kind of person, someone asks you, you have no usually have no problem saying no.
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.000 But if you're the other kind of worst, like, dang, now he put me into, in a position to be the bad guy.
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000 So they're way less likely to ask for stuff because they don't want to put that way.
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000 They don't want to put that way.
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000 They don't want to put that way.
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000 Person in opposition.
00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000 So it's like, yeah, they're saying no, but I don't want to put him in that position because he's going to feel like, oh, I, I would.
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000 There's like two kinds of people.
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:10.000 But it's weird when you get the clash of the kind of person, let's say I'm the kind of person who I don't want to put you in the position to say no.
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000 So I kind of, I'll be real shy to ask.
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000 But you're the opposite. You're going to be asking me for stuff and I'm going to be like, I won't answer you.
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000 I'll be bothered by if you, you know, for a few days and be like, man, I can't believe he's asking me to do this.
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000 You know, I can't believe he's asking me to get you.
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000 When you should just say no.
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:35.000 Yeah, no, but in my mind, if I say no, now I'm the bad guy. Now you're in my mind, you're at home saying I can't believe he won't do this for me.
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000 You know, you go through all this stuff.
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000 But, um, yeah, that's when you get that guy.
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000 Dude, it's tormenting living in your hand.
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000 Yeah, I'm like, no, next question.
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.000 Yeah, see, but then even when you say like, no, like, text message fully with text message.
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000 You know how you'll do, you say to real life, but at least I can see the look on your face, like, you're kind of half joking.
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000 I see it and all this stuff. But in text message, you say no period.
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000 Right, that's it.
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000 So I'm like, no, I'm chocolate anatomy.
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000 You know, you're the only thing you do like, you wouldn't have said it like that.
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000 You wouldn't, you know, but so yeah, you make it really hard, man.
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000 People read into a lot of stuff.
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000 Then that's, obviously, you have to read into some stuff to figure out what's going on.
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000 Yeah, but some of those people go crazy with that.
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000 You even married, but you got to read into everything.
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000 Every little thing you've got to read into.
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000 Hey, oh, by the way.
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000 Yes, so you got to, you know.
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000 All right, back to the book.
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000 Never quit.
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:40.000 Obviously, next one, find a way to turn every minus into a plus.
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000 Good.
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000 There is a solution every problem.
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000 Some are more complex.
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000 There's than others.
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000 There's always a way.
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000 While he was at West Point, he learned about toxic leadership.
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000 And here we go.
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000 They were, they were putting under the command.
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000 They're putting the squads.
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000 And here we go.
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000 This squad had two different squad leaders.
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000 One month with each.
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000 I've never forgotten those two men.
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000 The first one was arrogant.
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000 Was an arrogant, sadistic person who screamed in yelled at us.
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000 Made us do unmerciful physical exercises.
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000 Apparently with the goal of driving the week to quit the academy.
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000 I despised that man.
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000 A leader should never be arrogant, spiteful, condescending, or engaging gossip.
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.000 To the contrary, he should always act with humility and treat his subordinates with respect and dignity.
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000 As a leader, your words and action have greater impact on your subordinates than you realize.
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000 Thus, choose your words carefully.
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000 Avoid sarcasm and flippancy.
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000 Do not insult or take digs at anyone's intelligence.
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000 Remember, everyone processes information differently and at different speeds.
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:56.000 Don't automatically assume that someone is stupid or indifferent because they haven't mastered a particular task yet.
00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000 That stuff is so important.
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.000 This is something that I screw up because being an ass, growing up in a sea of opaltoon,
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000 everyone's always like picking on each other.
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000 What's that called verbally sparring and cutting each other down?
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000 That's just the way it is.
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000 I still have that in me.
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000 I still have that in me.
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000 I don't know.
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000 Do I not do that to you?
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000 I don't know.
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000 But I can do that sometimes when I know I should.
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000 I'm like, I'll do it to my kids sometimes and my wife sometimes.
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000 Sometimes I don't realize it until afterwards.
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000 And the thing is, in my mind, I'm kidding.
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000 It's all good.
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000 I have no ill will, but you can't do that.
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:52.000 That's one I need to always be careful of because I have a tendency to treat other people like their
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000 e-fives and a seal bin with me.
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000 That's not always good.
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000 Especially the wife that I'm in, and that before the wife.
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000 I said, this was the other day.
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000 I was the first day of the new year.
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000 I forget what my wife did.
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000 I feel what you did.
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000 But I was like, what a loser.
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000 Here's the thing.
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000 I've said that plenty of times and whatever to her.
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000 She said it to me whenever.
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000 But here's the thing.
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000 Either way, it's not like with you.
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000 If I said that or something like that or whatever.
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000 You did jokes.
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000 There would be a consistent reaction.
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000 I think.
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000 100% consistent.
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000 Yeah, you're right.
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000 You'd be like, yeah, it's obviously I don't really think you're a loser.
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000 The fact I said is part of verbal smart, whatever.
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000 That's a consistent kind of interpretable as you sheets.
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000 Yeah.
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.000 And so she said back, she's like, oh, first and
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000 salt of the new year.
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000 Kind of like, sure, that was her joke back.
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000 Right.
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000 Like, you know, the first thing.
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000 Yeah, but that's still a little like, and what I interpreted that or
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000 read into it is that,
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.000 dang, like, it didn't take you much time to start messing with me like that.
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000 Like, it's like, oh, that's what she said.
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000 Yeah, yeah, that's what she said.
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000 That's what she said.
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000 Yeah, all right.
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000 Yeah, I think I was right.
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000 I felt it immediately.
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000 I was like, dang, I got to be careful with that pen stuff.
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000 Yeah.
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000 I said that to my brother.
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000 You wouldn't care.
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000 Yeah.
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000 Yeah.
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000 This continues back to the book.
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000 Contrary to popular belief yelling and yelling at and
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000 berating your subordinates will not make the move faster.
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000 Nor will it inspire that annoyality.
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000 In fact, it may encourage them to begin plotting your demise.
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000 Many years from now, your subordinates will not remember what
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000 deadlines were met, what sales were closed, what products were shipped or
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000 what training schedules were executed, what they will remember is how you
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000 the leader treated them, whether you inspired a climate of trust and
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000 dignity or ruled through fear, metrics and intimidation.
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000 It's interesting.
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000 And again, that's that's something that I don't do.
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000 Like, I might take jabs at people in a fun way that sometimes are
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000 not as interpreted as fun as I want them to, but then we yell at people
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000 that don't berate them.
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000 Don't do anything like that.
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000 And this is 100% right when you see people like that.
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000 It's not good.
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000 And when I started on this, like working with civilians, I think they
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000 actually people actually thought I was going to come in yelling
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000 screen.
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000 Yeah.
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000 And I'd be like, no, I'd and lay for nine used to be like,
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000 you know, I can't take it down.
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000 People think they're going to do that.
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000 They do the work together for 18 months, how many times do I raise my voice
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000 at you and be like zero?
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000 And we need to make the audience guest, you know, or whatever.
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000 And lay for, always cracks the joke of like, there's a lot of times
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000 you wanted to yell.
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.42 Maybe because maybe that's good. Maybe yeah, maybe that's kind of part of the whole thing the whole picture, you know
00:41:08.96 --> 00:41:10.96 Why do they think that?
00:41:11.68 --> 00:41:15.26 Maybe because you yell in scream at other situations. I don't though
00:41:16.88 --> 00:41:21.24 If you videos of you yelling in screaming yelling in screaming, why I don't know stuff
00:41:22.56 --> 00:41:28.30 When you get into other stuff you don't never yell in scream at someone. Oh, you mean like I'm like I'm
00:41:28.30 --> 00:41:34.000 If I're not okay, well, that's a little bit if I'm raising and my voice is being a little bit more poignant
00:41:34.60 --> 00:41:40.72 Escalated. Yeah escalated. That's not screaming though. Yeah, so that's not yelling in screaming at someone, you know
00:41:40.72 --> 00:41:44.24 No, so maybe they just like feel that there's a lot of
00:41:44.86 --> 00:41:49.66 Fire coming from this guy and he's real effective in leading people in
00:41:50.58 --> 00:41:54.68 Hard-intensituations so the main thing is draw that connection, maybe it's weird
00:41:54.68 --> 00:41:59.36 The movies make it there. Yeah, because people are yelling in boot camp
00:42:00.84 --> 00:42:04.92 Here we go to another thing from West Point. This is
00:42:05.96 --> 00:42:07.96 Showfields
00:42:07.96 --> 00:42:11.24 Major general John showfields of civil war fame
00:42:11.84 --> 00:42:17.60 This is his definition of discipline. So now this is this is cool because we're talking about a guy from the civil war
00:42:18.72 --> 00:42:20.48 Right
00:42:20.48 --> 00:42:26.82 Here we go the discipline which makes the soldiers of a free country reliable and battle is not to be gained by
00:42:26.90 --> 00:42:28.90 Harsher tyrannical treatment
00:42:28.90 --> 00:42:34.22 On the contrary such treatment is far more likely to destroy than make an army
00:42:34.50 --> 00:42:41.40 It is possible to impart instructions and to give commands in such a manner and in such a tone of voice as to inspire in the soldier
00:42:41.40 --> 00:42:44.40 No feeling but an intense desire to obey
00:42:44.40 --> 00:42:53.20 While the opposite manner and tone of voice cannot fail to excite strong resentment and a desire to disobey
00:42:54.56 --> 00:43:01.52 The one mode or other of dealing with subordinates springs from a corresponding spirit in the breast of the commander
00:43:01.92 --> 00:43:08.90 He who feels the respect which is due others cannot fail to inspire in them regard for himself
00:43:08.90 --> 00:43:17.66 While he who feels and hands and hands of manifests disrespect towards others especially his infereers
00:43:17.98 --> 00:43:21.70 Cannot fail to inspire hatred against himself
00:43:23.38 --> 00:43:28.86 So again that what's cool that might sound all new worldy that's written civil war
00:43:29.14 --> 00:43:32.34 That's civil war, right that's old school and
00:43:33.38 --> 00:43:37.66 He's still talking about hey you got to respect your people. You got to treat them well
00:43:37.66 --> 00:43:41.66 That's a great that's a great definition of how to how to impose
00:43:43.34 --> 00:43:49.38 And I use that word is I it's you're not imposing that's the point you're not imposing discipline you're you're
00:43:50.38 --> 00:43:54.66 Opening the door and showing the way and leading that's what you're doing
00:43:55.78 --> 00:44:02.74 Cultivating an environment of this very very nice. I like that now he goes into the various brands of toxic leaders
00:44:02.74 --> 00:44:07.86 I'll burn through these bully leaders those who inflict emotional pain deliver threats and
00:44:08.06 --> 00:44:11.26 Ultimatums heral insults and invalidate the opinions of others
00:44:11.98 --> 00:44:15.38 narcissistic leaders those who are arrogant and self-congratulations
00:44:15.38 --> 00:44:21.70 Tory this brand of toxic leader will often contrast his own abilities against a subordinate's shortcomings. Look at me
00:44:21.70 --> 00:44:23.70 I can do this so easily. Why can't you?
00:44:26.26 --> 00:44:28.26 Insular leaders
00:44:28.26 --> 00:44:34.78 This brand of leader forms clicks and goes to great lengths to ensure that his followers are shielded and
00:44:35.06 --> 00:44:38.66 Enjoy special privileges. These are all different brands of toxic leaders
00:44:38.98 --> 00:44:45.26 Hit political leaders this is the one you talked about earlier. These leaders live by the mantra do as I say not as I do and
00:44:45.86 --> 00:44:47.86 rarely practice what they preach
00:44:48.66 --> 00:44:55.10 The hypocritical leader will hold his subordinates to a high standard, but won't apply that same standard to himself
00:44:55.10 --> 00:45:01.26 As a leader you should be usually be applying a higher standard to yourself than your people for sure
00:45:03.10 --> 00:45:08.58 Enforcement leaders. This is interesting. Enforcement leaders this mid-level leader seeks the approval of his
00:45:08.58 --> 00:45:12.38 Superior's without regard to his subordinates welfare
00:45:12.82 --> 00:45:20.66 He will consciously follow orders that are bad unsafe or illegal only to stay in the good graces of the organizational culture
00:45:20.66 --> 00:45:28.30 That's bad those guys those are bad leaders see him in the military. They're just they only lead
00:45:28.66 --> 00:45:35.78 They only they only do what they're told to look good, but everyone hates them and it's interesting
00:45:35.78 --> 00:45:39.38 Like you talk to someone that was above them in the chain of command and they call that guys a great guy
00:45:39.38 --> 00:45:41.86 Yeah, you super. You talk to someone as well. I hate that guy
00:45:42.94 --> 00:45:46.54 It's never that that that that that school-field's definition
00:45:46.54 --> 00:45:50.50 He said you cannot fail to inspire a hatred
00:45:52.42 --> 00:45:56.70 Treat sure thing treat people this you know that that you know what that is
00:45:56.70 --> 00:46:03.94 I think that is psychologically right human beings we want to be free we want to have we want to determine our our path
00:46:03.94 --> 00:46:07.34 Right when you take that away from someone and
00:46:08.30 --> 00:46:10.30 Just crush it
00:46:10.30 --> 00:46:12.30 They they
00:46:12.30 --> 00:46:17.06 Spite you for it and they hate you for where as if you can say look you can do this you can execute this mission
00:46:17.06 --> 00:46:25.58 How you want echo Charles? Yeah, yeah, you can do what you want here's the goal you figured out away as opposed to here's how you're gonna do everything my way
00:46:28.02 --> 00:46:35.70 Next one call us leader in similar vein to the enforcement leader the callous leader has a blatant disregard for his subordinates welfare or desires
00:46:35.70 --> 00:46:43.98 Credit hog leaders these leaders show ex show their toxicity by taking credit for an employee's success or contribution
00:46:43.98 --> 00:46:47.46 They resent the notion of getting credit where credit is due
00:46:49.50 --> 00:46:54.42 Blame shifting leaders the mirror image of the credit hog is the blame shifter
00:46:54.94 --> 00:46:59.18 This leader's quick to point the finger for anything that goes wrong and many times
00:46:59.18 --> 00:47:02.38 He actively looks for someone whom he can assign the blame
00:47:02.38 --> 00:47:09.38 The blame shifter will often maliciously accuse someone of wrong doing without evidence or probable cause
00:47:09.54 --> 00:47:12.54 That's a person that does not take extreme ownership
00:47:15.06 --> 00:47:17.38 bunch of toxic leaders that he talks about there
00:47:20.66 --> 00:47:22.66 Here's another
00:47:23.06 --> 00:47:29.94 Thing he talks about as a leader of any stripe you cannot simply give orders and expect your subordinates to follow them blindly
00:47:29.94 --> 00:47:37.58 To the contrary you must establish a clear intent of dressing the why and the desired end state
00:47:38.66 --> 00:47:44.30 It will never suffice for a leader to say because I said so as a reason for performing tasks
00:47:45.30 --> 00:47:49.12 If you can't justify the rationale of an order to yourself
00:47:49.28 --> 00:47:51.28 Don't make your subordinates do it
00:47:52.02 --> 00:47:54.82 Re-evaluate your reasons and find another method
00:47:55.98 --> 00:47:58.46 Have you ever said that as a
00:47:58.46 --> 00:48:05.42 Parent because they said yeah, everyone's in a while you know. No, no, it's stupid. It doesn't make sense to do that
00:48:05.78 --> 00:48:08.98 And when you say everyone's while you got a boss it out like like like
00:48:08.98 --> 00:48:11.14 Like your second alert emergency situation
00:48:11.14 --> 00:48:16.22 We look I'm telling you you could just put your shoes on we got to go like that because I said so yeah
00:48:16.22 --> 00:48:20.72 I mean that's that's what happens and you know it happens in the military too where you don't always have time
00:48:20.72 --> 00:48:25.78 You know if you're not if you're in a combat situation, you know you can't say a
00:48:25.78 --> 00:48:31.62 Hey, take that building over there and the reason why I want you to do this because bubble you know you don't have time to do that
00:48:31.62 --> 00:48:36.50 So but you have trust with your subordinates and they know where you're coming from and all that
00:48:37.18 --> 00:48:39.18 interesting so
00:48:39.18 --> 00:48:41.18 really when when you really break it down is
00:48:43.02 --> 00:48:47.46 You never want to do that ever no you never want to be just because I said so ever
00:48:48.14 --> 00:48:54.70 But like so this is the mercy is all the stuff this is another thing that life and I talk about is there's times
00:48:54.70 --> 00:48:56.70 Definitely where I was like life hit that building over there
00:48:57.90 --> 00:49:01.94 And this is what's cool. There's also times because I was the guy that was in church
00:49:01.94 --> 00:49:05.58 There was also times where life looked at me and said hey, Jocco move you're out down the over there
00:49:05.58 --> 00:49:09.70 And I was like okay because he needs me to do something so we have a mutually supporting
00:49:10.50 --> 00:49:13.70 Relationship yeah, it's not about like hey
00:49:13.70 --> 00:49:15.70 I'm the one that's out here barking all the orders
00:49:15.70 --> 00:49:18.66 We're doing we're trying to get something accomplished together and
00:49:19.78 --> 00:49:24.42 If he told me to do something I know he's got a good reason why because if he had time to tell me why
00:49:24.42 --> 00:49:29.30 He would tell me hey can you put your home view over there because we're gonna about to you know move guys out in this book whatever
00:49:29.30 --> 00:49:31.30 Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, I
00:49:31.30 --> 00:49:36.34 I don't need to hear all that unless unless I've got my home be there for reason and now he's saying to me like hey move your home view
00:49:36.34 --> 00:49:40.74 Hey, hold up. I got good coverage down this road. Oh, okay. I didn't see that can you push it back?
00:49:40.74 --> 00:49:44.26 Eight feet. Yeah, we can move it. Okay cool. You know what I mean? Yeah, so it's it's good
00:49:44.26 --> 00:49:46.26 We were we're cruising like that
00:49:46.26 --> 00:49:54.90 Yeah, but that's good, but as far as like the actual dynamics of why you shouldn't say because I said so because it's not in your case
00:49:54.90 --> 00:49:57.54 Let's say you don't have time to explain why right and
00:49:58.42 --> 00:50:02.18 You say move the handy right and you just move the handy
00:50:03.14 --> 00:50:10.74 Still even if you didn't explain why the reason still isn't because I said so and you know that because of all that
00:50:10.74 --> 00:50:16.90 Interesting is built the reason the reason is because there's some tactical situation that you know on full band yeah, yeah, of course
00:50:16.90 --> 00:50:23.06 Yeah, so it's one of those things where ultimately you never it never you never should be like because I said so never really should
00:50:23.30 --> 00:50:28.50 But in the event of not having time to explain or whatever even though there's an explanation needed
00:50:28.90 --> 00:50:33.38 In the event of that ever happening you need to kind of build trust yes, so you can
00:50:33.94 --> 00:50:35.54 Kind of alleviate that
00:50:35.54 --> 00:50:43.30 You know for the lack of time exactly what I explained to people when I talk about life and I on the battlefield that we had trust with each other
00:50:43.30 --> 00:50:47.22 So if we you know if I said to do something he'd do it and
00:50:48.58 --> 00:50:51.30 Know that I had a good reason for if he told me to do something
00:50:51.30 --> 00:50:54.10 I would do it because I know he had a good reason for and then later on
00:50:54.10 --> 00:50:59.38 He'd say yeah, you know, I need you to do that move that home because we had we you were blocking the field of fire from inside this building
00:50:59.38 --> 00:51:01.54 Oh, okay cool. Yeah, I moved it wrong
00:51:01.54 --> 00:51:05.54 So without that trust being built
00:51:08.58 --> 00:51:13.78 And you put that on top of my expectation of you to just follow my order
00:51:14.58 --> 00:51:17.46 Without asking why as a parent or whatever
00:51:18.82 --> 00:51:20.34 That is wrong
00:51:20.34 --> 00:51:23.46 What you say under you should not say that should not be
00:51:25.06 --> 00:51:30.42 Leading slash parenting and and so you got to remember you can get away with it for a little while like a new
00:51:30.42 --> 00:51:36.02 Chief checks into a seal puttone. He says hey guys, you know do this the guys are gonna do it
00:51:36.02 --> 00:51:40.66 Yeah, like they're gonna do it. There's there is a chain of command. There is a rank structure
00:51:41.38 --> 00:51:44.82 But if that's the persistent methodology leadership
00:51:44.82 --> 00:51:47.62 It's not gonna work for a long term. That's what you got to remember and
00:51:48.26 --> 00:51:52.02 When you do occasionally say that like when I would say to my guys to do something
00:51:52.82 --> 00:51:55.62 They do like they do it because they
00:51:55.62 --> 00:52:02.42 Because it was so seldom that I would utilize like some sort of the okay do this now
00:52:02.98 --> 00:52:04.58 very rarely
00:52:04.58 --> 00:52:06.58 Exercise that
00:52:06.58 --> 00:52:11.94 That power over the guys and it would probably I mean, I'm just assuming now
00:52:12.18 --> 00:52:15.94 But and it's probably because you never went to the
00:52:17.14 --> 00:52:19.94 Because I said so yes, no no
00:52:19.94 --> 00:52:26.18 Yeah, I don't think I don't think I actually ever said that so the left even even in situations
00:52:26.18 --> 00:52:29.22 What I would want to say yeah, like sometimes I'm right
00:52:29.46 --> 00:52:31.46 You know sometimes I just like I'm right you're wrong
00:52:32.02 --> 00:52:36.90 And I would I remember there was a weird running a block of training and the guys pulled out this
00:52:37.30 --> 00:52:39.30 certain element of training and
00:52:40.02 --> 00:52:45.30 I said hey, why did you pull off this element of training and they're like well, you know
00:52:45.30 --> 00:52:47.30 That's they gave their reasons which were all wrong
00:52:47.30 --> 00:52:53.62 And I and I was like I was like well, no, here's here's the reasons why you're wrong there
00:52:53.62 --> 00:52:56.18 You're wrong there and you're wrong there, but they were kind of adamant
00:52:56.90 --> 00:52:58.90 And I wanted to just say like hey
00:52:59.78 --> 00:53:03.78 Shut up and do what I'm telling you to do you put that put that element of training back in there now
00:53:04.42 --> 00:53:07.86 And I held myself back from doing that. I'm glad I did of course
00:53:07.86 --> 00:53:13.38 I'm glad I did because because because because here's the deal if you're right and you can articulate it
00:53:13.38 --> 00:53:15.94 I mean eventually I just took me more time to explain to the guys
00:53:15.94 --> 00:53:22.98 Hey look that element of training it might not be happening right now, but it could very easily happen again in the future
00:53:23.30 --> 00:53:28.98 Here's some examples here some place we are in the world here's other elements that are out there that are doing that same thing right now
00:53:28.98 --> 00:53:33.06 That we could easily get folded into so we need to continue to do that type of training
00:53:34.10 --> 00:53:36.10 And they were like yeah, okay, make sense
00:53:36.34 --> 00:53:43.14 But that was you know that took 20 minutes that took 20 minutes. I knew I was right a hundred percent
00:53:43.14 --> 00:53:46.34 No no no no no doubt in my military mind at all yeah
00:53:46.66 --> 00:53:50.50 I wanted to just say hey shut up and put the element back in training still didn't do it
00:53:50.50 --> 00:53:55.46 But I didn't do it. I want it. Yeah, that's how I'm doing so really
00:53:56.58 --> 00:53:58.58 almost ironically
00:53:59.78 --> 00:54:03.62 The less that you do say because I said so
00:54:04.66 --> 00:54:10.26 The more you can yes, absolutely just what I just said before the more you talk the less people isn't the same thing
00:54:10.26 --> 00:54:16.10 Yeah, or you demand people do things the less you can demand of them the last you demand people the more you can
00:54:16.10 --> 00:54:16.90 Yeah
00:54:16.90 --> 00:54:24.26 So the more use that tool very sparingly as a leader very sparingly and you know you kind of went down that rabbit hole
00:54:24.26 --> 00:54:26.82 But this one if you can't this other thing going back to the book
00:54:26.82 --> 00:54:30.50 I already read it but I'll read it again if you can't justify the rationale of an order to yourself
00:54:30.50 --> 00:54:36.42 Don't make your subordinates do it. This is something I get asked all the times like what if what if somebody came up and said
00:54:36.42 --> 00:54:40.74 They told you do something that you don't want to do but that you didn't think was right. I mean I wouldn't do it
00:54:42.18 --> 00:54:43.70 They're like oh really
00:54:43.70 --> 00:54:48.66 It's like yeah, of course really and here's the this is what they don't realize they think that everyone in the military is like
00:54:48.66 --> 00:54:51.94 Running around giving orders that are stupid and don't make any sense. That's not true
00:54:52.50 --> 00:54:56.18 No, you know when I got told to do things that didn't make sense a one good example that was
00:54:56.58 --> 00:55:00.74 Was taking Iraqis with us on the battlefield and they were saying we had to take a ratio of like seven to one
00:55:00.74 --> 00:55:03.06 Whatever the ratio was at the time and it didn't make sense
00:55:03.06 --> 00:55:07.62 And I said no, I want we're not gonna do that and I ran up the chain of command. They're like yeah, you're right doesn't make sense
00:55:07.62 --> 00:55:10.38 And you don't have to do it take what you can and we're like okay cool
00:55:10.38 --> 00:55:12.74 There's a perfect example me been like you know
00:55:12.74 --> 00:55:16.18 I'm carrying the line on the company guy. I'm all on board for the big win
00:55:16.58 --> 00:55:19.46 But if you tell me to do something that's stupid. I'm not gonna do it
00:55:19.70 --> 00:55:24.02 You know it's funny. I heard that about you. What do you hear that that's that's it?
00:55:25.06 --> 00:55:27.38 One of my friends. You obviously we know him, but
00:55:27.38 --> 00:55:35.34 He'd be like jacosol such a badass who like the way he talks to the this appears is like it's so gangster
00:55:35.34 --> 00:55:36.34 He'll be like
00:55:36.34 --> 00:55:42.50 He'll be like no, we're not gonna do that doesn't make sense, you know, whatever and now that you're like explaining it
00:55:42.50 --> 00:55:44.70 You make more sense because I wouldn't be that
00:55:44.70 --> 00:55:49.30 Yeah, but you know, you're there like oh my gosh, yeah, because I would be explaining it to him
00:55:49.30 --> 00:55:51.30 Yeah, and you got to be very careful
00:55:51.30 --> 00:55:58.34 That you're not coming across as arrogant that you're not coming across as know it all which and sometimes I would have a tendency to come across like that
00:55:58.34 --> 00:55:59.86 And I had to be very careful
00:55:59.86 --> 00:56:02.26 I'd check myself sometimes because you want to it's the same thing
00:56:02.26 --> 00:56:06.30 Just like you just like you want I want to tell my subordinates like shut up and put that element of training back
00:56:06.30 --> 00:56:09.90 And you want to tell your superiors the same thing and you know, hey shut up
00:56:09.90 --> 00:56:14.74 That's a dumb idea, but you can't do that and all you're gonna do then is what you're gonna do is you're gonna make them matter
00:56:14.74 --> 00:56:18.50 You the same thing that I just talked about going down the chain of cranks goes up the chain of command too
00:56:18.50 --> 00:56:20.50 so if
00:56:20.50 --> 00:56:26.26 If I treat you if you're my boss and I treat you with disrespect you're gonna hate me
00:56:26.26 --> 00:56:31.14 And it's gonna work out worse for me because I'm on the bottom side of that little pyramid we've built
00:56:31.14 --> 00:56:33.14 Yeah, so
00:56:33.14 --> 00:56:36.50 When I would talk to guys to my superiors and say that something doesn't make sense
00:56:36.50 --> 00:56:38.50 I would do it a very respectful way and
00:56:39.30 --> 00:56:44.26 Again, I had to be careful because sometimes especially people that didn't know me if you didn't know me
00:56:45.06 --> 00:56:47.86 I maybe that usually the people that didn't know me well
00:56:47.86 --> 00:56:52.02 I might come across as more arrogant, you know, and which is bad. I'm not saying like that that's bad
00:56:52.02 --> 00:56:54.02 I wish I wouldn't but
00:56:54.50 --> 00:56:57.70 If I didn't believe in something I wasn't gonna do it and I wasn't gonna be a jerk about it
00:56:57.70 --> 00:57:01.70 But I like hey here's what's going on if we take these number of guys in the field with this many Iraqis
00:57:01.70 --> 00:57:04.02 We're not gonna have all the people that we should have in the field to be safe
00:57:04.02 --> 00:57:06.98 You know you're talking about leaving behind a corpsman you're talking about leaving behind a
00:57:06.98 --> 00:57:09.06 A radio man you're talking about leaving behind a
00:57:09.06 --> 00:57:14.34 Close-air support fires guy those are guys. I can't go in the field without or someone could get killed and the
00:57:14.34 --> 00:57:18.66 The the the authentic man was like you're right cool yeah, and then this didn't again
00:57:18.66 --> 00:57:23.22 There would be occasional things, but it doesn't happen all the time where people are giving you stupid orders
00:57:23.22 --> 00:57:28.26 My bosses didn't give me dumb didn't tell me to do dumb things. Yeah, and I'm sure that's kind of
00:57:28.26 --> 00:57:31.70 You know sometimes they told me to do dumb things but they were little dumb things and you don't
00:57:31.70 --> 00:57:34.58 You know we did them yeah, we did them little paan little things
00:57:34.58 --> 00:57:37.30 You want to do something when you do something stupid, but it's small small and stupid
00:57:37.30 --> 00:57:42.10 I'll do it and I'll save my my objections to things that actually matter
00:57:42.10 --> 00:57:46.26 Yeah, makes sense those backs of that paper. We're gonna leave talks about doing paperwork and I
00:57:46.26 --> 00:57:49.62 Don't want to do paperwork and I'm like hey, we're gonna do the best paperwork because that's a little thing
00:57:49.62 --> 00:57:52.50 We don't care about it. You know what so we got to stay up next hour and do some paperwork
00:57:52.50 --> 00:57:56.66 Who cares? Yeah, we're gonna build that trust and that way when we had come time to say no for real
00:57:56.66 --> 00:58:03.06 We'll be able to say no for real and then the boss is listening to it. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure that that added to the whole cashier though
00:58:03.06 --> 00:58:09.22 You know where where when you did say something or did push back or whatever it would still you'd still get the results
00:58:09.22 --> 00:58:15.62 You know where someone who may not understand that fully as much as you did they just witnessed kind of the kind of the
00:58:15.62 --> 00:58:18.06 The end and be like dang jok who's getting silly
00:58:18.06 --> 00:58:22.02 Yeah, he makes stuff happen up the chain. Yeah, you know because cuz you know because to my guys
00:58:22.02 --> 00:58:23.78 I might be like hey guys, we're not doing that. Yeah
00:58:23.78 --> 00:58:30.02 Yeah, I think like I was like we're not doing that and they go to the go to the you know the boss is off
00:58:30.02 --> 00:58:31.70 It'd be like you know, I and DB from Hacer
00:58:31.70 --> 00:58:33.70 I'm just wondering about this plan. We got here
00:58:33.70 --> 00:58:35.46 I like to do it here. I don't like to go and then I come back
00:58:35.86 --> 00:58:37.38 We're not doing it
00:58:37.38 --> 00:58:39.38 Yeah
00:58:39.38 --> 00:58:42.50 So yeah, maybe that is you know level three gangster
00:58:45.54 --> 00:58:46.26 All right
00:58:46.26 --> 00:58:52.90 Here's another one leaders stay informed of current in events and they should anticipate challenges based on those events
00:58:52.90 --> 00:58:58.82 Just be be informed of what's happening that makes sense. Here's some other West Point lessons learned
00:58:59.78 --> 00:59:04.18 I was able to function mentally and physically in top form with only five to six hours of sleep a night
00:59:04.18 --> 00:59:10.02 Just saying take that for what it's worth. I don't advocate sleep deprivation
00:59:10.02 --> 00:59:15.30 But I'm just saying there's an example there that you might want to listen to another thing that you learned at West Point
00:59:15.30 --> 00:59:20.82 Read I love to read books and have and have since a very young age at West Point
00:59:20.82 --> 00:59:25.62 I discovered a magnificent library loaded with books on military history and leadership ever since then
00:59:25.78 --> 00:59:31.54 For more than 60 years now. I've been fascinated by the study of leadership military political business athletic
00:59:31.54 --> 00:59:36.58 etc and within that a focused interest in why leaders fail
00:59:37.70 --> 00:59:42.74 Remember a good leader is a lifelong learner who continually studies to perfect his craft
00:59:44.58 --> 00:59:50.90 It's interesting to hear these great leaders read you know again general madaces the classic
00:59:52.18 --> 00:59:54.18 5000 books in his personal library
00:59:55.46 --> 00:59:59.38 Hopefully we can get him on the podcast to discuss some of his favorite books
00:59:59.38 --> 01:00:01.38 Okay
01:00:01.38 --> 01:00:03.70 after he graduates from West Point
01:00:04.58 --> 01:00:10.10 He missed World War II. He goes to Japan and he's in the occupation of Japan
01:00:10.58 --> 01:00:18.34 Back to the book. I was flown up to Japan in October of 1945 and was sent north on a train on the 11th
01:00:19.14 --> 01:00:25.54 Airborne Divisions jump school or for the 11th Airborne division jump school arriving in Tokyo central train station
01:00:25.54 --> 01:00:31.14 I was struck by the cleanliness of the place and by the hundreds of Japanese soldiers in uniforms sitting on floors
01:00:31.14 --> 01:00:35.38 Liney against walls all unarmed no weapons and showing no anger
01:00:36.10 --> 01:00:44.50 Toward American soldiers a Japanese rail conductor showed me to a spotless alcove with a short bunk and clean sheets the train left on time
01:00:44.66 --> 01:00:47.70 And I arrived in the next morning exactly on time
01:00:47.70 --> 01:00:55.14 Here is my observation these people were six weeks out of a five year war and they had already began
01:00:55.62 --> 01:01:00.50 cleaning up and disciplining their services when they get back on their feet watch out
01:01:01.70 --> 01:01:07.62 Even in the midst of defeat carry yourself professionally and maintain your discipline
01:01:09.14 --> 01:01:11.14 That is the quickest way towards recovery
01:01:11.14 --> 01:01:20.02 Interesting story the Japanese know we just lost a five year war. We got atomic bombs dropped on us
01:01:20.74 --> 01:01:24.42 Guess what okay we lost sign unconditional surrender
01:01:24.98 --> 01:01:30.18 Unconditional surrender that means you have nothing you have no power zero nothing unconditional
01:01:30.98 --> 01:01:35.86 Unconditional surrender you know what keep your uniforms on be squared away get the trains running clean this place up
01:01:35.86 --> 01:01:42.34 We got to get back we got to get back together got to get back in the game. It's kind of like if a girl breaks up with you
01:01:42.66 --> 01:01:44.66 Right no
01:01:44.66 --> 01:01:45.70 Unconditional surrender
01:01:45.70 --> 01:01:47.94 Not saying the surrender part. I'm saying the clean yourself
01:01:47.94 --> 01:01:55.22 Yes clean yourself first later recovery for sure. Good train spiraling letting you first sure for sure if you get back in the gym
01:01:55.78 --> 01:01:56.50 Right
01:01:56.50 --> 01:01:57.78 The reading
01:01:57.78 --> 01:02:01.06 Well you go when you when you're no you're a hundred percent right
01:02:01.94 --> 01:02:03.94 You are right when you are defeated
01:02:03.94 --> 01:02:04.98 Yeah
01:02:04.98 --> 01:02:10.26 The best thing you can do is maintain your discipline. Yeah, that's the best thing you can do maintain your discipline
01:02:10.58 --> 01:02:13.86 Yeah, be surprised. I'll quick you get back on your feet
01:02:15.38 --> 01:02:17.38 There's a very few people the only
01:02:18.66 --> 01:02:21.06 Some people are the reason they're they're
01:02:22.10 --> 01:02:26.82 Jammed up is because they're not paying attention things they should be paying attention to
01:02:27.22 --> 01:02:29.06 Like they're they're working out
01:02:29.06 --> 01:02:34.58 17 hours a day and they're not paying attention to their family those are sometimes those guys get in the scrubs right and
01:02:35.70 --> 01:02:38.58 I kind of got to say look man
01:02:39.54 --> 01:02:44.50 You're in good shape you need to spend some time with your you know with your wife with your kids
01:02:45.22 --> 01:02:47.22 Give a little bit back
01:02:47.54 --> 01:02:50.10 Because that that happens to team guys sometimes yeah
01:02:51.22 --> 01:02:56.74 Gotta be careful that one. We're we tend to be water call. Oh, yeah, and the work is so fun that it just like can take
01:02:56.74 --> 01:03:03.86 Over everything wait so so what is that how does that does that contribute to their recovery in other situations? Well
01:03:04.42 --> 01:03:06.42 Let's just say there's a family
01:03:06.66 --> 01:03:11.70 Problem going on right and so what does the guy do this he's he's he's in the game right?
01:03:11.70 --> 01:03:14.34 He's well he's gonna work out even more he's gonna go to Jiu Jitsu even more
01:03:14.66 --> 01:03:16.66 But what he's doing is not helping the problem
01:03:16.66 --> 01:03:22.10 Yeah, you see them saying this is the most people don't have that for most people have the opposite problems when they get down
01:03:22.34 --> 01:03:23.62 When they get down they go
01:03:23.62 --> 01:03:29.30 You know, I don't feel like working out. I'm just gonna drink and pizza and donuts right that's what most people do
01:03:30.26 --> 01:03:33.54 A lot of time seals will be like, um, not feeling good. Cool. I'm gonna work out a harger
01:03:34.66 --> 01:03:39.78 You know, oh my family's not fun right now cool the gym is fine. Yeah, you did too's fun
01:03:40.34 --> 01:03:43.06 I was surfing on a nine day trip gang. That's like a
01:03:44.26 --> 01:03:47.70 Feedback loop kind of right in a way so it's like okay
01:03:48.02 --> 01:03:51.78 There's an issue with my girlfriend. I will make it last series. We issue with my girlfriend
01:03:51.78 --> 01:03:58.26 Mm-hmm. girlfriend's giving me grief whatever. I'm not around or something like that or I'm not sensitive to her feelings
01:03:58.26 --> 01:04:00.74 You know how I'm in to do with that. I'm gonna go work out
01:04:00.98 --> 01:04:06.58 Yeah, yeah, we make you guys which makes the problem worse now because you're paying attention less even less sensitive to her feeling
01:04:06.58 --> 01:04:10.90 The girlfriend is the one thing that with a wife is another thing. Yeah, because the girlfriend the guy will be like okay
01:04:12.90 --> 01:04:14.90 The wife is a different scenario
01:04:14.90 --> 01:04:16.58 Yeah, kids
01:04:16.58 --> 01:04:23.06 Big difference you just use your example wasn't good. It was you took a big you took what you thought was a small step, but it's a big step
01:04:23.86 --> 01:04:28.18 Two there's too much of a difference. Yeah, I'm pretty different because I'm so same example wife in kids
01:04:28.34 --> 01:04:34.34 That's supposed to girlfriend. Yeah, feed back loop. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is what I'm saying instead of instead of the guy going
01:04:34.42 --> 01:04:36.82 Because normal person good men will not feeling good because my
01:04:37.38 --> 01:04:41.62 Because my wife my girlfriend a normal guy. It's like hey, well, you need to get back in the gym
01:04:41.62 --> 01:04:44.58 Get your game together get up early get on the program
01:04:44.58 --> 01:04:49.78 Yeah, and they'll start feeling good and they'll start feeling good about themselves and they'll start being a better person and being a better husband
01:04:49.78 --> 01:04:56.58 Yeah, you say that to a team man. They're like okay cool. I'll work out in 19 hours a day and the other five I'll be doing jiu-jitsu
01:04:59.22 --> 01:05:01.22 Or whatever
01:05:01.54 --> 01:05:08.42 Next a good leader studies the culture of any location where he's planning to go and ensures his subordinates are properly educated on the same
01:05:10.10 --> 01:05:12.82 Here's a good one when in charge take charge
01:05:12.82 --> 01:05:18.26 But treat your subordinates with respect to dignity and common courtesy
01:05:19.14 --> 01:05:21.38 Here's another one a workers performance
01:05:21.86 --> 01:05:23.86 Often reflects the attitude of his leadership
01:05:24.66 --> 01:05:29.38 If you want something done ask nicely if a subordinate forgets to perform a task don't take it personally
01:05:29.54 --> 01:05:35.06 Just remind them nicely in any organization everyone has a to-do list while juggling these tasks
01:05:35.06 --> 01:05:39.22 Some things will never leave fall through the cracks when this happens don't assume that this subordinates
01:05:39.22 --> 01:05:45.54 Laze your stupid simply re-engage them on the task and if necessary emphasize why it's a priority
01:05:46.74 --> 01:05:52.02 If the subordinate performs a task and the outcome is not what you expected don't attack their intelligence or character
01:05:52.26 --> 01:05:59.38 Playfully explain the deficiencies and offer an idea for solution subordinates quickly lose respect for a leader who is all problem and no solution
01:06:02.26 --> 01:06:08.66 Speaking of problems wherever possible solve problems at the lowest level when leaders are confronted with disciplinary problems
01:06:08.66 --> 01:06:16.42 Be it willful disobedience negligence or honest mistakes they must resolve these problems at the lowest level before raising the the issue to higher echelons
01:06:17.38 --> 01:06:19.78 If the problem can be fixed and
01:06:20.18 --> 01:06:26.18 Remedy instituted at lower levels it will benefit your relationship with your subordinates improve the health of the organization
01:06:26.18 --> 01:06:31.62 And not divert higher level resources away from their priorities solve things at the lowest level. That's yeah
01:06:31.62 --> 01:06:34.18 That's I used to say this exact same thing to my guys
01:06:34.18 --> 01:06:39.46 Especially when it well when it came to anything but the topic would come up a lot of guys getting in trouble
01:06:40.02 --> 01:06:44.50 Okay, if a guy gets in trouble solve it like like solve it at your level
01:06:45.14 --> 01:06:50.26 And if you and if you don't think you can contain it tell me what do you mean get in trouble like oh
01:06:50.26 --> 01:06:53.38 Guy gets in trouble. Did you lie to get to do you well? Do you guys are pretty big one?
01:06:53.38 --> 01:06:57.94 But guy guys in your fight guy gets to do a fight out in town. Hey if you can a you can punish him
01:06:57.94 --> 01:07:01.22 You know the patoon chief here's about it and the patoon chief who says I'm gonna punish him
01:07:01.22 --> 01:07:06.98 He's gonna be doing brass pickup or whatever he's gonna be doing something cleaning the military vehicles as always
01:07:06.98 --> 01:07:09.22 You know one of the best what wax the six by
01:07:11.30 --> 01:07:14.02 That's that they you can handle it there you don't need to tell
01:07:14.74 --> 01:07:21.70 The patoon commander the patoon the task unit commander now it could be different the guy gets in trouble
01:07:21.70 --> 01:07:27.22 It now he gets arrested because now we're gonna hear about it because they're gonna find out the guys military
01:07:27.22 --> 01:07:29.94 They're gonna want to know talk contact the chain of command because that's what they do
01:07:29.94 --> 01:07:35.54 That's their that's their policy and so now they're gonna contact the chain of command
01:07:35.54 --> 01:07:40.26 So now can it be contained that's the question if it can't be contained then
01:07:41.30 --> 01:07:44.90 You got to run it up the chain of command because you don't want your boss to get get hit
01:07:45.30 --> 01:07:47.30 What's it called blind side right?
01:07:47.30 --> 01:07:48.58 It won't you
01:07:48.98 --> 01:07:52.98 Chocolate one of your guys was arrested you know yesterday why didn't you tell me you don't want that to have
01:07:54.18 --> 01:07:57.94 If you can contain it contain it if you can't do you got to you got to tell the chain of command
01:07:57.94 --> 01:08:01.46 Yeah, but you should try and contain it. You like hey, we got it handled
01:08:02.26 --> 01:08:04.66 Boss there was a guy got trouble yesterday here's the punishment I'd
01:08:05.14 --> 01:08:07.38 Delta out and here's or you know here's where I
01:08:11.06 --> 01:08:13.78 No one wants to be the senior guy with a secret if you've heard that before
01:08:14.18 --> 01:08:16.18 Senior guy with a secret
01:08:16.82 --> 01:08:21.62 Meaning meaning if you did something wrong and and I find out about it
01:08:22.58 --> 01:08:24.58 that means I'm
01:08:24.58 --> 01:08:30.66 I have the secret now yeah, and if I'm above you in the chain of command and now my boss finds out
01:08:30.66 --> 01:08:35.62 Well now I'm gonna get in trouble. So the easiest way for me to do it is to be like hey boss
01:08:35.62 --> 01:08:37.30 God and go to this wrong
01:08:37.30 --> 01:08:39.78 He got in trouble and then my boss now has the secret
01:08:40.58 --> 01:08:43.86 Yeah, he can tell his boss fully right. That's like the friend
01:08:44.26 --> 01:08:50.90 You know who catches his friends girlfriend or something to you know and it's like shoot. I don't want to
01:08:50.90 --> 01:08:56.18 Do I want to ruin the relationship or you know the relationship is already ruined
01:08:56.18 --> 01:08:59.06 You're right, so that's not a good exam. That's kind of a good
01:08:59.06 --> 01:09:02.26 Maybe that cheating real because there was a movie called
01:09:03.38 --> 01:09:06.34 I think it was called this and I don't know if it was a called the secret
01:09:06.34 --> 01:09:10.50 But that's what it was predicated on and so that's the whole thing he didn't want to
01:09:11.22 --> 01:09:14.50 Put it this way if he told if he was if you tell the secret
01:09:15.62 --> 01:09:20.50 He would like I don't know ruin some relationship and if he didn't it was like they'd be fine
01:09:20.50 --> 01:09:24.50 But you're the senior with a secret then of course at the end of the movie, you know they
01:09:25.62 --> 01:09:29.46 They find out you know the big reveal who is that Vince Vaughn?
01:09:29.46 --> 01:09:31.46 Was it anyway
01:09:32.10 --> 01:09:34.10 Talk to someone else about that
01:09:34.50 --> 01:09:39.70 You didn't have your own podcast echo movie reviews. Oh, it's the same concept I'm telling you
01:09:40.42 --> 01:09:41.46 Praise in public
01:09:41.46 --> 01:09:44.58 Practice punish and private. I think everyone knows about that
01:09:44.58 --> 01:09:51.06 Here's some here's some other left lessons he learned when he was occupying force in Japan be confident but not arrogant
01:09:52.74 --> 01:09:54.74 Self-confidence humility or
01:09:55.06 --> 01:09:59.06 The keys to getting any job done little dichotomy and those two obviously
01:09:59.70 --> 01:10:01.70 There's always a way
01:10:01.70 --> 01:10:06.18 Either you find a way or you make one if you can't think of a way don't hesitate to ask for help
01:10:07.30 --> 01:10:11.54 Take counsel from those who have information and experience it's so funny. I have some people won't ask for help
01:10:11.54 --> 01:10:19.30 Supervised check up on things but don't micromanage make sure you're subordinates understand their priorities of work
01:10:21.70 --> 01:10:26.02 I mean these I'm I just realize I was almost reading those as if like
01:10:27.14 --> 01:10:30.10 Hey, we already know these things it's like these are things that we know
01:10:30.74 --> 01:10:35.46 Not that not that they're not important and obviously how more new and before I did
01:10:36.10 --> 01:10:38.10 He learned them in the occupation of Japan
01:10:38.10 --> 01:10:42.42 Here he talks about some of that he worked for
01:10:45.30 --> 01:10:49.54 The officer under whom I served for the longest period in Japan was major man's field
01:10:49.94 --> 01:10:52.98 He was always cool never raised his voice
01:10:53.86 --> 01:10:58.58 Very perceptive took no wooden nickels and was a natural leader
01:10:59.30 --> 01:11:02.90 He told me that what he wanted to be done and let me run with the ball
01:11:02.90 --> 01:11:08.98 He trusted me and I went and extra two to three miles to make sure I would never let him down
01:11:09.38 --> 01:11:12.34 Never do a shabby job or never lose his trust
01:11:12.98 --> 01:11:17.86 That right there is this like you could just give that to people and say hey think about this man
01:11:17.86 --> 01:11:20.02 If you're gonna be in a leadership position think about this
01:11:20.82 --> 01:11:25.06 Always cool never raise your voice give people what you want to do and let them know with the ball
01:11:25.86 --> 01:11:28.98 Like that's just basic stuff, but it's so important
01:11:29.54 --> 01:11:31.54 What's the wooden nickel wooden nickel?
01:11:31.54 --> 01:11:36.18 It means it means you take you take things that don't work anything. Oh, yeah fake
01:11:40.18 --> 01:11:45.62 Couple more lessons learn tell your subordinate leaders your standards at the outset and what you expect
01:11:45.62 --> 01:11:47.62 That's a pretty good one
01:11:47.62 --> 01:11:51.94 If you let people get away with stuff for a while then when you jerk the chain back it hurts a more
01:11:52.82 --> 01:11:57.14 Push the authority down to make them sit decisions but keep responsibility for the results
01:11:57.14 --> 01:12:03.30 Don't blame support it's for bad results blame yourself for not training them properly or giving porn structures stream ownership boom
01:12:04.58 --> 01:12:06.58 for sure
01:12:06.58 --> 01:12:12.42 Always man well I see it and then I'll see I feel like I've done a good job in being conscious of this
01:12:12.66 --> 01:12:19.46 You know, okay, so if I say it, okay, so one year old four year old four and a half whatever and I say hey, you know
01:12:19.46 --> 01:12:23.46 Watch him. I'm gonna go grab this thing for my car whatever watch him don't let him
01:12:23.46 --> 01:12:26.02 Climb up on that bike and fall down
01:12:27.22 --> 01:12:28.42 He's one
01:12:28.42 --> 01:12:32.82 So I run in the you know I come back of course climbing the bike yeah
01:12:33.54 --> 01:12:35.06 Falls down yeah
01:12:35.06 --> 01:12:40.50 Hey, I thought I told you not to let you tell the four year old. I know that's what makes example even more powerful
01:12:40.90 --> 01:12:47.62 Because look hey look her failure is my failure that emphasis my failure even more so four year old
01:12:47.62 --> 01:12:49.62 That's my failure
01:12:49.62 --> 01:12:53.54 But the same thing for a big time check
01:12:54.74 --> 01:13:00.98 Be dead honest with those above you and below you totally candid but not harsh straight talk
01:13:01.54 --> 01:13:03.54 Respect your people
01:13:03.94 --> 01:13:08.66 Taking care of your people is not just about the obvious things pay working conditions
01:13:08.66 --> 01:13:14.18 Concern for their welfare and that of their families but seeing that they are properly trained and have the person
01:13:14.18 --> 01:13:16.82 Discipline and desire to get the job done and get it done well
01:13:16.82 --> 01:13:25.22 Carri a notebook or three by five cards and take notes when being given instructions or when your boss is explaining his philosophy or guidance on a matter
01:13:26.42 --> 01:13:31.54 I also found that when running or doing other physical exercises ideas and useful thoughts would pop into my head
01:13:31.94 --> 01:13:33.94 Possibly related in some medical way
01:13:34.74 --> 01:13:36.74 Blood movement goes to the brain
01:13:37.14 --> 01:13:40.66 So I took scrolling notes when running. That's not a bad. I've done that before
01:13:40.66 --> 01:13:47.70 I'll be like working out and I'll in my workout book. I'll have a little like four words of something I thought of or like yeah
01:13:48.82 --> 01:13:52.58 Yeah, I don't know if it's that interesting, but it's worth noting
01:13:52.98 --> 01:13:57.38 Yeah, I mean if that's true, you know like where like the carrying a notebook around now the nowadays
01:13:57.38 --> 01:14:02.74 Who people would notice in your phone do you put notes in your phone? Yes, I put notes my phone too. Do you take voice memo sometimes? No
01:14:03.30 --> 01:14:08.82 I saw someone doing it. I thought it was so cool, but I have it didn't didn't stick it stick
01:14:08.82 --> 01:14:14.50 It's not bad. I usually type in the notes. Yeah, but sometimes if I'm driving voice note
01:14:15.30 --> 01:14:19.22 Yeah, okay now he's a company commander in Korea
01:14:19.86 --> 01:14:23.54 So Korean war so you know he there's again. We're jumping to this book, but
01:14:24.74 --> 01:14:26.26 This is the I thought this was awesome
01:14:26.98 --> 01:14:29.78 He takes over as they as a company commander
01:14:30.66 --> 01:14:35.86 One of my first acts as commanding officer was to move six men out of the worst
01:14:35.86 --> 01:14:41.38 Bores nest in the place these mortarmen had been billeted in a derelict bunker
01:14:41.38 --> 01:14:46.26 Which was infested with rodents. I moved them into the officer's bunks and
01:14:46.74 --> 01:14:50.82 I moved down there moved us down there into the first mortarmen's old bunker
01:14:50.82 --> 01:14:52.66 I had some Korean support troops
01:14:52.66 --> 01:14:57.78 Cretcline at first though and it was very added adequate for my gunnery officer recon officer worn off
01:14:57.78 --> 01:15:03.70 Sir myself a few mice and bugs, but not bad one corner my end was dug into an old Korean grave
01:15:03.70 --> 01:15:07.70 Which was immediately covered, but there is still a lingering odor
01:15:08.34 --> 01:15:10.66 I keep my feet down at that end and
01:15:11.22 --> 01:15:15.78 Liberal use of an aerosol bomb and open and opening the door and it's not bad sleeping at all
01:15:15.78 --> 01:15:20.58 These graves are hard to avoid to tear scattered help or skeletal all of these hills were our positions are so
01:15:21.30 --> 01:15:24.58 What I thought was awesome about that he takes over as a company command
01:15:24.58 --> 01:15:28.74 These enlisted guys are living in this crappy stinky rodent filled barracks
01:15:28.74 --> 01:15:33.54 He kicks them out moves them into the officers barracks and moves the officers into the crappy barracks
01:15:33.54 --> 01:15:35.54 That's what I'm talking about
01:15:36.34 --> 01:15:38.34 That is legit
01:15:38.98 --> 01:15:44.10 Some more points from Korea good leaders don't wait for official permission to try out a new idea
01:15:44.58 --> 01:15:50.10 In any organization if you go looking for permission you will inevitably find the one person who thinks it's his job to say no
01:15:51.78 --> 01:15:53.78 It's easier to get forgiveness than permission
01:15:53.78 --> 01:15:57.70 Put the welfare of your own troops above your own
01:15:59.14 --> 01:16:02.02 They eat before you eat they sleep before you sleep
01:16:02.82 --> 01:16:05.54 Simple acts of courtesy and graciousness if I've profowned
01:16:06.10 --> 01:16:09.30 Impact on subordinates morale self perception and performance
01:16:12.42 --> 01:16:13.94 So
01:16:13.94 --> 01:16:17.62 Every leader is put through an informal process in the first few weeks
01:16:17.62 --> 01:16:22.10 Where in his people judge him and decide whether or not he's worthy of their trust
01:16:22.10 --> 01:16:29.46 He must earn their trust how a leader must prove himself by his actions appearance to meaner attitude and decisions
01:16:29.86 --> 01:16:34.42 I like that you're definitely getting looked out when you take over something for the first time you're getting looked at hard
01:16:39.62 --> 01:16:41.86 The leader must be visible on the battlefield
01:16:41.86 --> 01:16:46.42 He must be in the battle but Italian commander on down brigade and division commander on occasion
01:16:46.42 --> 01:16:51.54 He must exhibit his determination to prevail no matter what the odds or how desperate the situation
01:16:52.58 --> 01:17:00.90 He must have and display the will to win by his actions words tone of voice on the radio and face to face his appearance as demeanor his countenance and the look in his eyes
01:17:01.94 --> 01:17:04.58 He must remain calm and cool no fear
01:17:05.78 --> 01:17:12.98 He must ignore the dust the noise the smoke the explosions the screams the wounded the yells or the dead lying around him that is all normal
01:17:12.98 --> 01:17:21.46 He must never give off any hint or evidence that he is uncertain about a positive outcome even in the most desperate situations
01:17:26.42 --> 01:17:32.10 So again, you know what you brought up earlier of this hey we're not gonna show any fear
01:17:32.10 --> 01:17:37.70 We're not gonna show any possibility of ever losing you know, I don't think he's talking about that
01:17:39.14 --> 01:17:41.14 I think he's talking about
01:17:41.14 --> 01:17:46.10 Even though you might be thinking that and even know you might give the indication hey look if we don't get our act together
01:17:46.10 --> 01:17:48.98 We could lose this thing but we're not going to
01:17:51.62 --> 01:17:52.90 Some more
01:17:52.90 --> 01:17:58.02 Korea examples I've been taught for years that leaders must set the example and I tried to do so
01:17:58.34 --> 01:18:03.94 But in battle is absolutely mandatory and especially so during the Korean war at the company level
01:18:03.94 --> 01:18:09.46 I learned that I could keep common functional in the bed them stress noise blood and killings of a fierce battle
01:18:09.46 --> 01:18:11.46 I had no choice but to remain calm
01:18:12.34 --> 01:18:14.34 Stay in shape
01:18:14.34 --> 01:18:16.50 When we were not in battle or another operation
01:18:16.50 --> 01:18:19.54 I took a run in the late afternoon for an hour or so
01:18:21.70 --> 01:18:26.82 The first reports in the battlefield are usually exaggerated for good or bad and are not entirely accurate
01:18:26.82 --> 01:18:31.22 This is normal since they are sent back by leaders in a moving battle in our fragmentary
01:18:31.22 --> 01:18:41.46 First reports you're always wrong. That's what we used to say and that's usually pretty true. Here's a good one
01:18:41.86 --> 01:18:43.86 Be ready so you don't have to get ready
01:18:45.30 --> 01:18:51.46 A good leader will preposition as many assets and people as he can before an event or as in a contingency in case of disaster
01:18:52.90 --> 01:18:55.70 Thus when the alert and or emergency
01:18:55.70 --> 01:19:02.42 Annavidably comes you'll be better prepared to respond to it be ready so you don't have to get ready
01:19:07.46 --> 01:19:11.14 He talks about when things are quiet and here he's talking about when things are quiet
01:19:12.34 --> 01:19:15.38 On the line and nothing's going wrong tighten up security
01:19:16.26 --> 01:19:20.90 Be sure the listening out post are alert, especially at night and in particular if it's raining or snowing
01:19:20.90 --> 01:19:30.02 That's the most appropriate time for the enemy to close in it's interesting how he's talked about that told he talks about it a bunch
01:19:30.02 --> 01:19:37.70 But you know for him when if there's nothing going on do something right if you got a day off do something to make your position better
01:19:37.70 --> 01:19:42.42 If you're not getting attacked good improve your position every moment he's thinking about that
01:19:42.42 --> 01:19:53.14 When you draw a plan of attack or defense you must have information on the weather terrain and enemy capabilities
01:19:53.14 --> 01:19:55.78 But you cannot coordinate your plan with the enemy
01:19:58.58 --> 01:20:01.22 Therefore you have to think through all the what ifs
01:20:03.22 --> 01:20:06.50 The enemy does this what happens if the enemy does that what happens it's time well spent
01:20:07.06 --> 01:20:09.54 We always say the enemy gets a vote not what he said
01:20:09.54 --> 01:20:14.18 Yeah, you can you can court you can make your plans, but your plans aren't coordinated with what the enemy's gonna do there
01:20:14.18 --> 01:20:16.18 The enemy's gonna do what the enemy's gonna do
01:20:17.06 --> 01:20:22.10 Soldiers in battle fight kill and die and die primarily for each other
01:20:30.26 --> 01:20:32.26 Don't complain to your boss
01:20:33.62 --> 01:20:35.62 He wants solutions not just problems
01:20:35.62 --> 01:20:43.06 Right, yeah, and that's not just to your boss. That's up and down the chain of command
01:20:44.10 --> 01:20:49.14 Yeah, I'm saving private rain when he said you never grape down the chain of command. Yeah
01:20:49.86 --> 01:20:55.86 Definitely I think that was a different point news making pretty well it's it's well I just set up or down the chain plan
01:20:55.86 --> 01:21:03.94 He's saying don't grind up. No, he's saying don't great down. He's right. Go up. He's saying yeah, well he's saying don't gripe up and you're saying don't
01:21:03.94 --> 01:21:10.74 Gripe down and I'm saying don't gripe. Yeah. Well he's saying don't don't complain to your boss. Yeah, like that's a gripe
01:21:11.30 --> 01:21:16.26 Yeah, well yeah, the way I took it on saving private rain anyway was a gripe meaning like
01:21:16.82 --> 01:21:20.90 I have a complaint about this that I need the answer to kind of think it's more of a comprehensive thing
01:21:20.90 --> 01:21:25.94 Dude, you cannot see you cannot delete it's a difference between gripe and and complain
01:21:25.94 --> 01:21:30.58 They're the same thing. Well, I feel like complaining because only because he's a complete
01:21:30.58 --> 01:21:34.98 A complaint is might be a little bit more formal than a gripe a gripe is like man
01:21:34.98 --> 01:21:39.22 I can't believe we're not getting the same food again. Yeah, but it's also complaint
01:21:40.10 --> 01:21:43.54 Yeah, I think you're right about now a complaint could also be we are low on ammunition
01:21:43.70 --> 01:21:48.10 That's being beyond a complaint, right? That's like a critical situation. Wait, so gripe is less
01:21:48.42 --> 01:21:52.34 gripe is a little bit less, but they're the same freaking thing. Yeah, you know either one of them
01:21:52.34 --> 01:21:58.82 Upboard down the chain of great. That's but the last few brings solutions with you. Okay, so that's that is what I think was kind of like a
01:21:58.82 --> 01:22:04.58 Given what I felt anyway and keep the same private right meaning like if you have an official complaint like
01:22:04.58 --> 01:22:11.38 I'll say we need to change this. Yeah, I'm not gonna get you my beer right because he wants he doesn't want you to do it down because it makes you look like a week leader kind of thing
01:22:11.38 --> 01:22:12.74 I'm assuming
01:22:12.74 --> 01:22:19.78 With this he's saying hey, don't just come with all your complaints in no solutions to your to your superiors because it's a
01:22:19.78 --> 01:22:20.82 Superior's one
01:22:20.82 --> 01:22:25.14 Answers. I think they want solutions. Yeah, yeah, but when you gripe down the chain of command
01:22:25.14 --> 01:22:29.38 There's two things number one if you just complain down the chain of command
01:22:30.26 --> 01:22:31.30 then
01:22:31.30 --> 01:22:33.62 The guys are gonna take that and run with it
01:22:33.78 --> 01:22:38.10 But that doesn't mean you don't explain things down the chain of command that doesn't mean you don't say hey guys
01:22:38.26 --> 01:22:41.70 We're low on ammunition here's what's going on our vessel
01:22:42.42 --> 01:22:47.30 Transport got hit in sunk by a torpedo they didn't deliver the ammo or grab then people go
01:22:47.30 --> 01:22:51.94 Yeah, that's less as opposed to just a can't believe we don't have an ammo. Yes, yes
01:22:51.94 --> 01:22:55.14 We don't have enough ammo. This is an issue
01:22:56.50 --> 01:23:03.22 Maybe that's kind of what he meant that only goes up. Oh, yeah, try to think but both of them you have to tell you guys that you don't have enough
01:23:03.22 --> 01:23:09.70 Famionition you say hey guys we don't have enough ammunition here's what's going on. I put in for more the transport got sunk and
01:23:10.26 --> 01:23:15.14 And this is the situation where and we need to use our ammo as sparingly as possible. That's not a complaint
01:23:15.14 --> 01:23:20.18 No, that's an explanation of what's going on and a commander's intent about how much
01:23:20.18 --> 01:23:24.42 Ammonition we're going to use yeah, the conserving ammunition yeah
01:23:26.02 --> 01:23:28.02 check
01:23:30.34 --> 01:23:34.90 Back to the book we're getting into Vietnam shortly after 9 a.m. on June 29, 1964
01:23:34.90 --> 01:23:39.22 I was handed the colors of the second battalion 23rd infantry accepting the colors
01:23:40.42 --> 01:23:42.26 Means the commander is now
01:23:42.98 --> 01:23:47.46 Responsible for all his command does or fails to do
01:23:47.46 --> 01:23:51.62 Yeah, once you're in charge you're responsible for everything
01:23:56.34 --> 01:23:57.86 Now
01:23:57.86 --> 01:24:00.66 If you remember in we were soldiers once and young
01:24:01.86 --> 01:24:09.94 There was the lost platoon which was led by Henry T. Haric Lieutenant Henry T. Haric and this guy was known to be aggressive
01:24:10.66 --> 01:24:14.58 Aggressive to the point of being reckless, right overly aggressive
01:24:14.58 --> 01:24:16.58 And
01:24:16.58 --> 01:24:18.98 His sergeant major and this is this is from the book
01:24:19.70 --> 01:24:23.78 Here sergeant major plumbly told him Colonel if you put Lieutenant Haric in there
01:24:23.78 --> 01:24:27.30 He will get all of them killed his senior enlisted man
01:24:28.18 --> 01:24:31.54 His sergeant major told him hey don't put this guy in charge
01:24:31.94 --> 01:24:33.94 He put him in charge anyways
01:24:34.50 --> 01:24:36.50 And he regretted that
01:24:36.50 --> 01:24:45.86 And he said that that was one of his leadership letdowns that he failed to remove a toxic leader from the ranks and and Haric soldiers
01:24:46.02 --> 01:24:53.06 Ultimately with a ones that that paid the price and therefore he says when you identify a toxic subordinate leader remove them
01:24:54.50 --> 01:24:59.06 If you cannot remove them re-assign them to a role where their toxicity can be minimized
01:24:59.06 --> 01:25:10.42 So and I mean Haric that does it and again you have to get the book where your soldiers once and young so you get the whole story because I didn't cover it in enough detail
01:25:10.82 --> 01:25:15.14 Because it's one thing that's going on in that in that whole scenario
01:25:15.94 --> 01:25:20.98 And and Haric kind of redeemed himself getting the guys together to at least defend themselves
01:25:21.62 --> 01:25:24.74 for days out in the field being attacked like
01:25:25.78 --> 01:25:27.46 Over and over and over again
01:25:27.46 --> 01:25:33.94 But it was his hyper aggressiveness that got them in that situation in the first place
01:25:35.62 --> 01:25:37.22 This is an interesting one
01:25:37.22 --> 01:25:43.38 He's talking about his troops and he says their duty at their level is just as important as my duty at my level
01:25:45.14 --> 01:25:50.34 That's that's awesome and I've talked about this before Haric is wanted like every guy in my
01:25:50.34 --> 01:25:52.82 Paltoon to think that they were the most important person in the Paltoon
01:25:52.82 --> 01:25:58.58 And that's what he said and it's right. It's not just like I was like manipulating it's like no you're the radio man
01:26:00.02 --> 01:26:04.58 If we need help you're the only person that's gonna get us out. Yeah, you're the corpsman for one of our guys gets moved
01:26:04.58 --> 01:26:06.58 You're the only person that's gonna be able to save it
01:26:06.58 --> 01:26:07.86 You're the machine gun
01:26:08.10 --> 01:26:12.18 You're gonna know some important job in the Paltoon yeah without you blamed down cover fire we can't move
01:26:12.82 --> 01:26:14.82 It's like everyone
01:26:14.82 --> 01:26:17.14 Everyone's the most important everyone's job is important
01:26:20.10 --> 01:26:22.10 now
01:26:22.10 --> 01:26:24.10 he
01:26:24.66 --> 01:26:26.66 He's actually
01:26:26.90 --> 01:26:29.70 Critical and and I got some feedback
01:26:30.74 --> 01:26:39.94 With with on we were soldiers once and young you know hair here's a guy that led his troops into the situation and a bunch of guys died and how is that in any way heroic?
01:26:39.94 --> 01:26:41.94 And that's valid right I mean
01:26:43.14 --> 01:26:48.10 A valid point we don't now the the counter to that is look you don't know you're gonna get ambushed if you get it if you know
01:26:48.10 --> 01:26:50.58 You're gonna get ambushed like that against you know
01:26:50.58 --> 01:26:55.46 15 hundred soldiers the enemy soldiers then you would make this different decision
01:26:55.46 --> 01:26:57.62 But we don't know that we don't know that we don't have a crystal ball
01:26:59.14 --> 01:27:03.70 But here's some of how more is criticism of the way
01:27:04.58 --> 01:27:07.78 The Vietnam war was fought and again this is similar to hackworth and
01:27:08.50 --> 01:27:14.90 Hackworth eventually stood up and said this out loud during the war which is why he got so much criticism from the army and
01:27:15.78 --> 01:27:17.78 Also one of the reasons why I
01:27:17.78 --> 01:27:22.58 Like hackworth so much is because he did what I was talking about earlier
01:27:22.74 --> 01:27:27.94 He's like no I don't believe in doing this and we're we're not gonna win this way yeah, he said that
01:27:29.78 --> 01:27:33.86 Here's what how more says from 1964 until the American withdrawal
01:27:34.58 --> 01:27:43.78 1973 are objectives kept changing from political stability and preventing an enemy takeover to preserving the independence of South Vietnam and training the
01:27:43.78 --> 01:27:47.94 Arvin forces at first the US pushed
01:27:48.74 --> 01:27:56.02 The South Vietnamese army aside and took the war over with a brand of fighting that only American forces and American logistics could support
01:27:56.90 --> 01:28:05.38 When we left in 1973 our heritage was just that a form of war that the South Vietnamese and its armed forces could not sustain
01:28:05.38 --> 01:28:14.02 In the late 1970s the army chief of military history general Douglas Kanard wrote a book called The War Managers
01:28:15.62 --> 01:28:22.90 He sent a questionnaire to 175 army generals who had served in Vietnam his book is the analysis of their replies
01:28:23.94 --> 01:28:32.42 Nearly 70% of those generals were uncertain and unclear as to what the US objective was in Vietnam
01:28:32.42 --> 01:28:37.94 Damn that's horrible. That's absolutely horrible
01:28:39.22 --> 01:28:42.42 175 generals and
01:28:43.14 --> 01:28:45.14 70% of them didn't know
01:28:45.14 --> 01:28:53.62 What the objective was now if you that's the genels you take that down the step to the kernels to the battalion commanders to the company commanders to the
01:28:53.62 --> 01:28:59.38 Patoon commanders to the squad leaders you get down the front lines and you guys have no idea what they're doing there
01:28:59.38 --> 01:29:06.42 How do we expect to accomplish the mission when no one in the chain of command really understands what it is that the objective is what the mission is
01:29:11.06 --> 01:29:13.06 So
01:29:14.50 --> 01:29:16.02 With that
01:29:16.02 --> 01:29:23.54 Colonel Morse as a leader must have clearly defined objectives. He must ensure that these objectives are clearly understood by his subordinate leaders
01:29:23.54 --> 01:29:27.70 Lesson learned
01:29:34.74 --> 01:29:36.74 Here's a
01:29:37.86 --> 01:29:46.18 Speaking of family life there are at least five activities that must be kept in balance through proper time management these five activities are the job
01:29:46.50 --> 01:29:51.54 Physical fitness personal time alone recreation and social relationships
01:29:51.54 --> 01:29:56.18 Also if they apply to others religion and family
01:29:56.90 --> 01:29:59.54 If any of these get out of balance then life gets out of balance
01:30:01.06 --> 01:30:03.86 For my own personal experience and observation of others
01:30:04.50 --> 01:30:11.14 Being a workaholic is the most common area of imbalance and again that's what I saw a lot with with the guys I used to work with
01:30:11.78 --> 01:30:16.02 They're workaholics and not with that you know you meet business guys all the time
01:30:16.02 --> 01:30:20.50 You're not you're not there's so many business guys that are workaholics
01:30:22.50 --> 01:30:25.86 Business men business women that are out there they're grinding they love it
01:30:26.90 --> 01:30:32.42 And then I want to stop and that's again that's that's problematic. It's not it's not the most common
01:30:33.14 --> 01:30:35.14 But business leaders
01:30:35.62 --> 01:30:41.06 Why are they in a leadership position because they built something why they build something because they wanted to win because they wanted to take over
01:30:41.14 --> 01:30:44.90 Well, that doesn't just stop at a certain point it keeps going it keeps growing
01:30:44.90 --> 01:30:49.54 You reach one goal and you've said another one a higher one. That's the harder one. Yeah, that keeps going
01:30:50.58 --> 01:30:52.58 Be careful that one
01:30:53.14 --> 01:30:55.14 Balance
01:30:57.86 --> 01:31:03.62 After Vietnam he went and took over a base where they were running basic training and here's what he said about basic training
01:31:03.62 --> 01:31:08.50 The goal was for every man leaving basic combat training to be in the best physical shape of his life
01:31:08.50 --> 01:31:14.26 And to know it to stretch his mind and his muscles and to assist him in thereby gaining more pride in himself
01:31:14.26 --> 01:31:17.62 More self confidence and above all more self discipline
01:31:18.66 --> 01:31:23.38 A man who has more self discipline has more confidence in his ability to do the job
01:31:24.02 --> 01:31:28.02 I got asked a while back me. That's your on the podcast, but you know guys it had to go over a unit
01:31:28.42 --> 01:31:34.74 They're kind of down-trodden. What do I do to get there? They're pride back up. Yeah, work them hard do hard training
01:31:35.62 --> 01:31:37.62 That's what you do
01:31:38.26 --> 01:31:40.26 Discipline
01:31:40.26 --> 01:31:43.94 Hard training give them something to brag about give them something to take pride in
01:31:46.74 --> 01:31:49.06 He was dealing with Vietnam protesters
01:31:50.10 --> 01:31:52.58 When he was running that base and
01:31:53.30 --> 01:31:56.10 He just said guys don't even show your weapon
01:31:56.10 --> 01:32:00.10 No, don't even we're gonna completely under react. I'm not gonna give him what they want
01:32:00.10 --> 01:32:05.22 And that's one of his tenants here don't over react and never over react to an over reaction
01:32:05.94 --> 01:32:07.94 and
01:32:07.94 --> 01:32:14.18 And I'm gonna close this out with a pretty big chunk here, but this is
01:32:15.06 --> 01:32:17.22 When how more got back from Vietnam
01:32:17.70 --> 01:32:20.26 he wrote a little piece called
01:32:20.82 --> 01:32:22.82 Lieutenant leadership in combat
01:32:26.10 --> 01:32:31.46 And here's what he says. This is a compilation of few my views on leadership of and by loutenates
01:32:32.18 --> 01:32:35.06 Specifically infantry platoon leaders in a combat zone
01:32:35.06 --> 01:32:41.86 It will be somewhat mixed in perspective and is not possible in these few words to get across my full views on leadership
01:32:42.26 --> 01:32:47.78 In my judgment, a leader builds over time his own unique brand of empathy or lack of it
01:32:47.94 --> 01:32:53.70 With his subordinates and creates his own leadership debits and credits with those under his orders
01:32:53.86 --> 01:32:58.90 So you've heard we talk about leadership capital same thing. He's talking about their leadership debits and credits
01:32:58.90 --> 01:33:06.02 He does not he does this through personal contact and shared experience based on the
01:33:06.02 --> 01:33:13.54 Interplay between leader and lead working with mixed perspectives shaped by the dynamics of real time and real life
01:33:15.22 --> 01:33:18.18 Leadership is a highly personal individual matter
01:33:19.14 --> 01:33:25.22 Each leader must establish his own approach based on an internal compass using a method geared to his personality
01:33:25.22 --> 01:33:32.66 His capabilities but always oriented toward accomplishing the mission while knowing and taking care of his men now while he says that
01:33:34.18 --> 01:33:40.50 You got to come up with your own your own method of leadership there the fundamental principles that he talks about that we talk about all the time
01:33:40.98 --> 01:33:47.86 That we wrote about those don't change you got to find your methodology of presenting them and carrying yourself
01:33:48.26 --> 01:33:51.30 But the fundamental principles are fundamental
01:33:51.30 --> 01:33:53.30 Hmm
01:33:54.58 --> 01:33:57.30 As officers we are given groups of men to lead
01:33:58.42 --> 01:34:07.94 Other officers NCOs and enlisted soldiers each has a different background different problems a different outlook and different duties
01:34:09.22 --> 01:34:14.18 But no matter what their background or their previous experience no matter how much love
01:34:14.18 --> 01:34:20.74 Care and effort may have been spent over the years by their parents and raising them when they are turned over to us
01:34:22.42 --> 01:34:25.46 Are now ours to care for
01:34:26.58 --> 01:34:31.94 At that instant the parents teachers or system that brought them to that point will be in the past
01:34:33.54 --> 01:34:37.22 Their lives and future are largely in our hands
01:34:37.22 --> 01:34:47.22 This is a terrible responsibility for a fire team leader to have not to speak of a battalion a division or a corps commander
01:34:52.02 --> 01:34:58.10 You got all these different people coming in and your response will form now and I'll tell you have had this conversation with business leaders too
01:34:58.66 --> 01:35:00.66 Business leaders are the same way
01:35:00.66 --> 01:35:05.30 Because when you're paying someone's paycheck they're feeding their family they're paying their mortgage
01:35:05.30 --> 01:35:08.42 They're saving for their kids to go to school. They're paying their car payment
01:35:09.70 --> 01:35:11.70 That's their life
01:35:11.70 --> 01:35:15.86 And if you as a leader are not helping them to achieve
01:35:16.74 --> 01:35:18.74 You're letting them down
01:35:20.34 --> 01:35:24.66 Now is it the exact same thing as having their actual life or death in their hand? No, it's not the same thing
01:35:25.14 --> 01:35:27.14 But the pressure is there
01:35:29.86 --> 01:35:31.86 Among other attributes
01:35:31.86 --> 01:35:33.86 I
01:35:33.86 --> 01:35:37.94 Feel soldiers of any rank must have confidence in four directions
01:35:38.50 --> 01:35:40.50 The first is to have self-confidence
01:35:40.50 --> 01:35:49.54 Developing it leverages many resources the primary sources expert knowledge of his assigned duties in readiness at any time to take on the next higher job
01:35:51.70 --> 01:35:53.78 So you don't want your people just trained to do their job
01:35:53.78 --> 01:35:58.74 You want them to be able to step up and do the next job above them in the chain of command in addition to creating
01:35:58.74 --> 01:36:05.14 Confidence through individual expertise his superiors facilitated development through trust and how they treat them
01:36:06.26 --> 01:36:10.50 This is imperative every person's dignity must always be respected
01:36:11.30 --> 01:36:15.62 I feel that if anyone under me fails the fault is at least half mind
01:36:16.82 --> 01:36:21.38 A man should never be caused to think poorly of himself and this requires a subtle
01:36:21.38 --> 01:36:30.02 Unsensitive touch by the leader especially when taking disciplinary action
01:36:30.82 --> 01:36:34.90 So the first thing you want us to have is self-confidence, right, and you develop it by how you treat them
01:36:36.90 --> 01:36:44.26 Second but non-priority word in non-priority order is the necessity for each to have complete confidence in his personal weapon as
01:36:44.26 --> 01:36:51.14 Well as any other weapon he might have to handle to include using radios and the knowing procedure
01:36:51.14 --> 01:36:55.38 And knowing the procedures for requesting and controlling mortar and artillery fires
01:36:56.50 --> 01:37:02.90 Developing this takes leader controlled leader supervised training. So you want to be good at your job
01:37:03.62 --> 01:37:09.38 You want to be expert in your job the the more expert you are in your job the more confidence you're gonna have
01:37:11.70 --> 01:37:19.94 The third confidence in the unit and the men who are fighting the third is confidence in the unit and the men who are fighting with him
01:37:19.94 --> 01:37:24.66 At whatever level the leader must strive to develop and intense a speed of core
01:37:25.06 --> 01:37:27.30 But never by running down other units
01:37:28.42 --> 01:37:36.10 An example of what not to do is to permit internal sub-units to be so disloyal to the organization as a whole as to critique
01:37:36.10 --> 01:37:41.86 Criticize snipe or run down sister units be it a squad putoon or company on up
01:37:41.86 --> 01:37:48.74 It is self-defeating and tears the unit as a whole tears down the unit as a whole so
01:37:50.34 --> 01:37:52.02 You want them to have
01:37:52.02 --> 01:37:57.38 Esprit a core but you don't want them to get it by cutting it down other units that are within your team
01:38:00.34 --> 01:38:04.02 Fourth and so vital a man must have confidence in trusting his leaders
01:38:05.46 --> 01:38:10.58 He must know and utterly believe his leaders are competent professionals who know
01:38:10.58 --> 01:38:16.74 What they are doing and are not careless or casual in their outlook toward their responsibilities
01:38:18.18 --> 01:38:23.38 For a subordinate to be confident in his leader the subordinate must know the leaders are aware of and
01:38:23.62 --> 01:38:29.06 Appreciates what the subordinate must face and the life he must lead in performing his job
01:38:31.06 --> 01:38:38.90 The leader must make every effort to get inside the heads of his men and see their problems and the world from their viewpoint
01:38:38.90 --> 01:38:40.90 You got to get the perspective of your people
01:38:42.10 --> 01:38:44.58 You got to understand what they're going through
01:38:45.70 --> 01:38:48.10 You know he talked about and we were soldiers once or young
01:38:48.74 --> 01:38:54.66 that in the in the civil war the the officers it was like bad if you can ride your horse all the time
01:38:55.06 --> 01:38:59.46 Because you didn't understand the guys that were marching with their going through it and Vietnam some guys were riding the helicopter all the
01:38:59.46 --> 01:39:01.86 Some commanders would stay over the battlefield it
01:39:02.26 --> 01:39:06.42 2000 feet out of a small arms range where safe up here nothing can happen
01:39:06.42 --> 01:39:10.98 But you forget what those guys are going through down there on the ground yeah the gems and
01:39:13.14 --> 01:39:19.38 Should you do the instructor at jams him up sometimes when you know when you for you're trying to teach someone something
01:39:19.38 --> 01:39:22.34 And I said this before they called it a curse and knowledge where you don't
01:39:22.90 --> 01:39:27.94 You're so advanced you forgot what the white belt is going through yeah in his learning you know
01:39:28.18 --> 01:39:30.18 So you start teaching stuff and you know
01:39:30.18 --> 01:39:37.78 They you forget that they need to know this stuff first before they can pick up this other stuff, you know you need perspective
01:39:37.78 --> 01:39:39.78 Yeah, they're perspective
01:39:41.06 --> 01:39:45.62 Back to the book this takes some doing and while the leader cannot be intrusive into personal affairs
01:39:45.62 --> 01:39:46.58 He must
01:39:46.58 --> 01:39:50.98 Help solve personal problems if he can especially if the problems penalize
01:39:51.38 --> 01:39:53.38 Individual or unit performance
01:39:53.38 --> 01:39:59.70 For example in garrison and to some extent even in a combat area most disciplinary
01:40:00.10 --> 01:40:05.30 Problem stem from women alcohol firearms control money and vehicles
01:40:07.38 --> 01:40:12.10 This is this is from from my old job. This is a hundred percent true women alcohol
01:40:12.42 --> 01:40:21.14 Fieroms control not so much money and vehicles for sure guys crashing cars guys DUIs guys crashing motorcycle guys getting trouble with girls
01:40:21.14 --> 01:40:25.14 Drinking is is encompassed in all those
01:40:27.14 --> 01:40:30.34 Knowing this a leader can perform a lot of preventative maintenance
01:40:31.46 --> 01:40:38.34 As an isolated but not so example pay problems often arise for separated families living on limited income
01:40:39.54 --> 01:40:43.14 Many of these can be eliminated in advance by real leadership
01:40:45.14 --> 01:40:46.34 In summary
01:40:46.34 --> 01:40:52.90 My views are take care of the troops develop four way confidence and be professional
01:40:54.34 --> 01:40:59.14 This ensures we can carry out our first duty accomplishment of the mission
01:41:00.42 --> 01:41:02.90 Finally concerning professionalism
01:41:04.34 --> 01:41:12.98 I believe even now the clock is bringing us closer to some few seconds minutes or hours in the future
01:41:12.98 --> 01:41:16.66 When the professionalism we will have or will not have
01:41:18.26 --> 01:41:23.62 We'll make a life or death difference for the men placed under our leadership
01:41:24.50 --> 01:41:28.98 And whose families can only trust hope and pray
01:41:30.90 --> 01:41:32.90 That we know our business
01:41:39.46 --> 01:41:41.46 And
01:41:41.46 --> 01:41:44.18 again there's more in that book
01:41:46.98 --> 01:41:50.66 But I think we'll close it out there
01:41:52.18 --> 01:41:54.58 Because what a thing to keep in your mind
01:41:55.70 --> 01:42:00.02 Just keep that in your mind that even now the clock is bringing us closer
01:42:02.50 --> 01:42:05.30 Closer to a moment when your
01:42:05.30 --> 01:42:10.74 Leadership will be tested
01:42:11.54 --> 01:42:17.54 And it is your professionalism and that means your ability your mental and physical strength
01:42:17.54 --> 01:42:23.38 Your knowledge your judgment it will all be tested at some point
01:42:28.50 --> 01:42:34.66 Have we done enough to prepare for that moment have we trained hard enough
01:42:34.66 --> 01:42:40.18 Have we studied hard enough have we read enough have we learned enough
01:42:42.98 --> 01:42:44.98 Are we prepared
01:42:47.06 --> 01:42:49.06 For what is coming
01:42:52.02 --> 01:42:55.46 And I think that's all I've got for
01:42:56.82 --> 01:43:00.50 Tonight so echo speaking of being prepared
01:43:00.50 --> 01:43:07.30 Sure, maybe you can give us some advice on getting a little more prepared sure be glad to
01:43:08.98 --> 01:43:12.10 Prepared for I'll start with a preparation for
01:43:12.90 --> 01:43:14.90 Did you get to a few jujitsu references?
01:43:14.90 --> 01:43:16.90 Did you do this life?
01:43:17.46 --> 01:43:20.66 Crap please like jujitsu is life and jujitsu is life by the way
01:43:21.22 --> 01:43:28.26 There's a lot of similarities I would say the Asians I jujitsu is life well if you say that then that's cool the metaphor no no no no
01:43:28.26 --> 01:43:33.14 But for some people jujitsu is life. Yes, they're just training good good for them
01:43:34.58 --> 01:43:35.38 Maybe
01:43:35.38 --> 01:43:39.54 It shouldn't be your whole life. Yeah, yeah, I didn't mean that we're meant to like
01:43:40.18 --> 01:43:47.06 jujitsu reflects life it's like a metaphor for life. Yes, I find it so in the event of you being injured you too
01:43:47.62 --> 01:43:50.34 Like many people are and more people are becoming
01:43:50.34 --> 01:43:58.26 Mm-hmm a lot of people ask me what gui to get I know yep I'm going into it you get an origin gui that's it
01:43:59.94 --> 01:44:01.94 How many do you have
01:44:02.26 --> 01:44:04.26 Four four okay have three
01:44:04.98 --> 01:44:06.26 Okay
01:44:06.42 --> 01:44:08.42 Every single one of them is outstanding
01:44:10.42 --> 01:44:12.42 Yeah, designed
01:44:12.82 --> 01:44:16.18 Outstanding design designed here though here
01:44:16.18 --> 01:44:24.18 In America and the right you jujitsu players by the way yeah jujitsu players so I was I watched
01:44:24.90 --> 01:44:31.06 One of their one of Pete's videos and it was it's so if you go to their YouTube channels
01:44:31.06 --> 01:44:35.14 Yeah, you know the how you have the main video. Yeah, it's watching that and it made sense
01:44:35.14 --> 01:44:43.38 You know you see everyone that's part of the the factory they kind of give their input in the video a little bit and it made sense so like
01:44:43.38 --> 01:44:51.02 You know like there's a lot of geese that are made you know kind of thing but if it's made by jujitsu people they're gonna know like when you put on a gui
01:44:51.54 --> 01:44:58.38 Jacket they're gonna know the difference between a gui that's that whoever designed it had this in my there
01:44:58.38 --> 01:44:59.78 When you put your hands up
01:44:59.78 --> 01:45:06.66 What's that gui gonna do you know if you're just oh, I'm just like I'm gonna make a gui and they don't necessarily do jujitsu
01:45:06.66 --> 01:45:09.70 They might not pay the pay attention that kind of stuff yeah or
01:45:09.70 --> 01:45:14.10 You know when you do jujitsu, let's face it like if you do karate
01:45:15.06 --> 01:45:19.62 Your body goes through a certain thing right while you're doing karate and whatever capacity
01:45:19.62 --> 01:45:25.86 If you do jujitsu your body is gonna go through a certain thing and more appropriately your gui is gonna go through a certain
01:45:25.86 --> 01:45:29.38 Exterior you can't use a karate gui for those you just yeah
01:45:29.38 --> 01:45:36.26 That's one of the things I'm saying so let's say the way you put on and keep on a karate gui or a jujitsu gui
01:45:36.26 --> 01:45:40.26 Is gonna be gonna play a role in
01:45:41.62 --> 01:45:46.18 When you do jujitsu so like look you type you know when you tie your pants or something like this
01:45:48.42 --> 01:45:50.82 How your pants are tied
01:45:52.34 --> 01:45:57.62 Matters when you do jujitsu true just like how you belt it when you're belt it's tight it matters
01:45:57.62 --> 01:46:03.62 You know what Pete and these an origin they kept that in mind when they designed it and it shows too by the way
01:46:03.62 --> 01:46:08.66 Hmm, so anyway these are some of the reasons that you should
01:46:09.22 --> 01:46:16.50 100% get an origin gui if you're still wondering what you'd get more important that if you don't do
01:46:16.50 --> 01:46:19.78 jujitsu and that's why you don't need a gui start jujitsu
01:46:20.18 --> 01:46:24.10 Yeah, then you'll need a gui and then you're more important you start jujitsu
01:46:24.66 --> 01:46:29.54 Yeah, that's what we're talking about the parallels between jujitsu and life and you'll get in good shape
01:46:29.54 --> 01:46:33.94 And you'll you'll learn to defend yourself real situations
01:46:34.90 --> 01:46:41.62 Re-calibrate your instincts recalibrate your instincts which were completely wrong by the way. They're wrong. Yes, if you're right now
01:46:41.62 --> 01:46:46.34 If you're listening and you're thinking you know my instincts are that bad no, I'm telling you that if you don't think they're wrong
01:46:46.34 --> 01:46:49.46 Go to jujitsu category and tell me you got good instincts. Let's roll
01:46:52.02 --> 01:46:56.90 In life do you want to turn your back to your problems in life? No, you do not
01:46:56.90 --> 01:47:00.82 In jujitsu do you want to turn your back to your problem? No, you do not okay, but
01:47:01.62 --> 01:47:05.14 Your instinct might tell you in a fight and sometimes in life
01:47:05.14 --> 01:47:09.70 Yeah, you do it because that's what we do sometimes see that's where that's why how more we're sorry
01:47:09.70 --> 01:47:13.14 We're not listening to our instincts all the time not all the time, but
01:47:13.78 --> 01:47:17.94 We don't follow them. Yeah, you've listened to it. That's a caution
01:47:18.34 --> 01:47:23.38 Right, but no, no, he's saying if they're predicated on your education experience learning reading
01:47:23.38 --> 01:47:31.54 Right, so essentially you are gonna listen to your recalibrated instincts after you train in jujitsu with your origin geek
01:47:31.54 --> 01:47:34.34 Because that's when you're gonna get because that's the best one straight up
01:47:35.22 --> 01:47:41.14 That might sound like an opinion, but it's a straight-up fact you get these skis at origin-main.com
01:47:41.70 --> 01:47:43.70 There's some other stuff on there
01:47:44.34 --> 01:47:47.54 Some apparel rashguards compression gear
01:47:47.54 --> 01:47:52.34 Hmm that being said this also other stuff
01:47:53.62 --> 01:47:56.18 Supplemental stuff something okay, so cruel oil
01:47:56.90 --> 01:47:59.14 You know what supplements that I think
01:47:59.86 --> 01:48:02.82 Jockel things I'm just being free right now. What are good supplements?
01:48:03.46 --> 01:48:04.82 Crill oil
01:48:04.82 --> 01:48:08.66 stuff to join warfare these are things to maintain your
01:48:08.66 --> 01:48:16.82 Structure bodily structure the two scientific something no, I don't think you have the capability of sending two scientific
01:48:20.10 --> 01:48:21.94 Real I think you might be right
01:48:21.94 --> 01:48:27.14 No, no, that was one of those digs I was talking about earlier. I don't mean it in a bad way, but it kind of come across like I'm a jerk
01:48:27.14 --> 01:48:32.50 Yeah, what do you say? I'm stupid. You said I'm stupid. Oh, this ain't stupid. I'm real scientific. Should I just not talk anymore?
01:48:32.98 --> 01:48:34.98 Some people would support that
01:48:34.98 --> 01:48:37.70 Don't answer that anyway
01:48:38.34 --> 01:48:43.06 Supplements yes, Jockel has to be lovers and there's echo haters. Okay, they're both there's two camps
01:48:43.62 --> 01:48:45.62 Yeah, the echo lovers is a bigger camp
01:48:46.34 --> 01:48:49.86 Hopefully the echo haters is a louder camp
01:48:50.66 --> 01:48:52.66 Yeah, and it makes sense
01:48:54.42 --> 01:48:59.38 The gripes I think they come up the chain or down the chain
01:48:59.38 --> 01:49:07.38 Both yeah, man makes sense hate to me if you're honest you're honest there it is nonetheless back to supplements
01:49:07.38 --> 01:49:12.10 Jockel supplements their good supplements supplements. Jockel actually takes see that's a big deal
01:49:13.22 --> 01:49:20.82 Do what I say not what I do in this case you got discipline in right now you do it all kinds of bringing stuff back close
01:49:20.82 --> 01:49:27.06 No, I'm just trying to learn these things. I'm applying to my life and in this particular
01:49:27.06 --> 01:49:30.66 Situation life is telling the people
01:49:32.02 --> 01:49:39.78 But joint warfare and super krill oil anyway. It's omega 3's in the krill oil obviously if you didn't know about krill oil. I think that
01:49:41.78 --> 01:49:49.14 Krill oil ended up to be one of those sleeper what he called sleeper supplements you know something where you like it's been going on the whole time
01:49:49.14 --> 01:49:54.42 And you didn't know about it. I'm about it. Yeah, yeah, kidding. That's me nonetheless
01:49:54.42 --> 01:49:58.50 Jockel as it takes it. I take it and I will say
01:49:59.46 --> 01:50:01.46 100% effectiveness my opinion
01:50:02.18 --> 01:50:06.90 Ordnment scientific opinion scientific yeah a big time double blind triple
01:50:08.42 --> 01:50:13.06 Ordnment.com. That's where you get it also for a pre mission
01:50:14.02 --> 01:50:16.82 Supplement new supplement
01:50:16.82 --> 01:50:20.02 Jockel supplements. It's called disciplines like a pre workout
01:50:21.06 --> 01:50:23.06 cognitive enhancer
01:50:23.06 --> 01:50:32.02 Is that accurate well, yeah, it's pre life life we have mission because yeah because what's your mission because
01:50:32.58 --> 01:50:37.14 I just don't need cognitive enhancement when I when I'm gonna get in the game
01:50:38.10 --> 01:50:40.10 I also need to have physical yeah
01:50:40.74 --> 01:50:48.58 For small to location yeah, so that's why we made it yeah because I wanted because because when I do stuff it's physical and mental
01:50:48.58 --> 01:50:52.58 Yeah, it's physical and mental you need to be both those need to be
01:50:54.50 --> 01:51:01.06 Tuned up yeah, I'm firing so enhanced if you will at at the very least
01:51:02.26 --> 01:51:05.46 It should be squared away. Yeah, well and a good thing you can feel it
01:51:07.14 --> 01:51:10.50 See and that works real good for jjitsu too because jjitsu is one of those things
01:51:10.50 --> 01:51:14.42 Let's say come to an up-bench press you know people ask me all the time like good
01:51:14.42 --> 01:51:21.22 You take a pre workout in the morning because I get up early morning and I work out I do not take a pre workout in the morning before I go and work out the morning
01:51:21.22 --> 01:51:23.94 No, yeah, you don't want to take a discipline. No, I don't take draw me
01:51:23.94 --> 01:51:29.22 I go in the night drink water a brush my teeth drink water. You go then I go and do my morning workout
01:51:30.10 --> 01:51:35.46 So I do not take a pre workout or a new tropic prior to working out in the morning
01:51:35.62 --> 01:51:37.54 However for the
01:51:38.10 --> 01:51:42.18 Jitsu yeah, there is a I would say I'm about
01:51:42.18 --> 01:51:47.86 60 or 70% of the time I'm on on the discipline when I go in there
01:51:48.66 --> 01:51:50.66 Yeah, because
01:51:50.66 --> 01:51:58.74 You can feel it like it you can feel better like why not have good training? Yeah, and that seems like jjitsu is one of those things like life is one of those things where
01:51:59.54 --> 01:52:01.54 This kind of supplement makes
01:52:02.74 --> 01:52:05.86 100% sense because it is physical and mental and not just
01:52:06.42 --> 01:52:10.58 Like everything's mental. I get it. You brain drizzer. I get it's true even if you're doing
01:52:10.58 --> 01:52:16.10 You know bench press or whatever. It's still mental for sure, but jjitsu is like
01:52:16.42 --> 01:52:18.42 Your mind has to be going at the same
01:52:19.46 --> 01:52:20.42 pace
01:52:20.42 --> 01:52:23.54 You know you're using your mind just as much if it's not more during jjitsu
01:52:23.54 --> 01:52:27.14 You're using your body by the way. I think if you were gonna do looks
01:52:27.14 --> 01:52:32.50 Okay, so in the mornings I don't need it. Yeah, bro. I don't need it like I don't
01:52:33.14 --> 01:52:36.26 In the morning I'm ready like I wake up and and I'm
01:52:36.26 --> 01:52:42.02 Like ready to rock and all I don't I'm gonna get in there. I'm gonna get it get it yeah
01:52:42.58 --> 01:52:44.34 I will say this during
01:52:44.34 --> 01:52:48.74 Over the Christmas time some of my workouts in the morning because I had other responsibilities
01:52:49.22 --> 01:52:51.62 During that time period because you got early morning
01:52:52.34 --> 01:52:54.58 Tactical things that you're doing around Christmas
01:52:54.58 --> 01:53:01.46 Exeter and because you got kids and whatnot and so some of my workouts were and then in the app when I was working on the afternoon
01:53:01.46 --> 01:53:06.74 I was getting on the discipline of the afternoon because it's not the morning time anymore
01:53:06.74 --> 01:53:12.10 Yeah, but oh, so you're like one of the guys who like you know certain people they have their like
01:53:12.74 --> 01:53:18.18 What do you call it like time of day where they're performing yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't think I think my performance actually
01:53:18.18 --> 01:53:20.98 Pakes in the afternoon like most people. I think that's the most common time
01:53:21.94 --> 01:53:25.22 But in the morning when I get up I'm ready to rock and roll as well
01:53:25.22 --> 01:53:29.46 I'm saying I don't I just want to get in there and get it done like I'm I feel like I missed out
01:53:29.46 --> 01:53:33.78 I want you stuff when I was sleeping. Oh for oh yeah, like what just happened
01:53:34.02 --> 01:53:37.30 I kind of feel obviously I feel like I'm working on it like tank I could be sleeping
01:53:40.98 --> 01:53:45.86 None of the last it's called this one the pre mission we call it a pre mission yes

02:00:23.42 --> 02:00:26.06 New year new me waking up early every single day
02:00:27.26 --> 02:00:30.46 Maybe none of the Sundays or maybe Sunday's too. I don't know whatever either way
02:00:30.46 --> 02:00:37.50 When you wake up sometimes you're not gonna feel like it sometimes you're gonna want to hit this news boom put in one of these tracks
02:00:39.66 --> 02:00:42.30 It's juggle on there telling you
02:00:42.30 --> 02:00:44.06 Pragmatically
02:00:44.06 --> 02:00:47.82 Giving you practical advice on why you shouldn't hit the snooze
02:00:48.62 --> 02:00:51.66 Same thing with skipping workout same thing with cheating on the diet
02:00:53.50 --> 02:00:58.94 Do you call it cheating on the diet? I don't know what you call like all that eating donuts eating donuts
02:00:58.94 --> 02:01:02.46 Slipping up the diet, you know hitting these speed bumps
02:01:03.26 --> 02:01:05.10 weakness speed bumps is what they are
02:01:06.38 --> 02:01:11.58 Speed bumps had some chocolate chip had some chocolate cake with mint chocolate chip ice cream
02:01:12.14 --> 02:01:14.14 Oh, no, there's any was good
02:01:14.14 --> 02:01:21.02 How many times more than once no I you know what I had twice in the same situation
02:01:21.58 --> 02:01:23.90 Like boom I'm back again
02:01:23.90 --> 02:01:25.82 Boom like two hits and boom
02:01:25.82 --> 02:01:30.70 It was like chocolate cake with mint chocolate chip ice cream which is not normal
02:01:30.78 --> 02:01:33.98 So that's right why it got me. I wasn't listening to psychotic or
02:01:33.98 --> 02:01:36.22 Correct, you need to see that's a perfect example
02:01:36.70 --> 02:01:37.98 Where
02:01:37.98 --> 02:01:41.10 Actually, that's not a perfect example because I'm sure you were kind of like hey
02:01:41.74 --> 02:01:46.62 Freedom yeah, that was the freedom you were free part of discipline equals yes your exercising the freedom part
02:01:47.02 --> 02:01:49.02 This is for times we're like you're at work
02:01:49.82 --> 02:01:51.82 But I'm actually fasting right now
02:01:51.82 --> 02:01:57.42 Other than having some chocolate and some discipline yeah, I'm fasting yeah people some people
02:01:57.42 --> 02:01:59.02 You're no perfect
02:01:59.02 --> 02:02:01.02 Whatever
02:02:01.02 --> 02:02:04.46 I go right in 27,000 calories a day to eat them
02:02:05.34 --> 02:02:08.62 Four calories a day still not fasting. I think fast
02:02:09.02 --> 02:02:14.14 Zero. I don't know. I'm not a fasting expert either way what this is about what
02:02:14.94 --> 02:02:17.90 Psychologic warfare what what you were done who it's for none?
02:02:17.90 --> 02:02:21.34 You were not better. There's a whole explanation that even done
02:02:22.46 --> 02:02:27.26 We're still on you know what it is not an out of you how I'm tracking you said no you said
02:02:28.22 --> 02:02:30.38 You use the example of you eating chocolate
02:02:30.94 --> 02:02:35.10 Magic okay with mint chocolate with ice cream as one of the scenarios
02:02:37.18 --> 02:02:40.46 The chocolate cake had like a hard shell of chocolate on it
02:02:40.46 --> 02:02:42.46 Yeah, it's legit
02:02:42.46 --> 02:02:44.78 That is the well the reason I asked
02:02:44.78 --> 02:02:48.46 How many times can we kind of melt it a little bit yeah?
02:02:48.86 --> 02:02:49.90 That's how
02:02:49.90 --> 02:02:54.86 That's good. Well you do it with like a brownie so it melts that actually onto it's kind of the same
02:02:55.26 --> 02:02:57.26 There's a restaurant
02:02:58.06 --> 02:03:04.54 In San Diego, Obe California. It's called Raglan and they have something they're called the illegal
02:03:05.26 --> 02:03:11.98 Yeah, because it's so good that it should be so illegal right and it is it's up. It's no big deal
02:03:11.98 --> 02:03:17.50 Right this one makes it so good is it's just the a little cast iron pan
02:03:18.30 --> 02:03:24.62 Just a little cast iron pan and they cook a chocolate chip cookie it yeah, and then they put vanilla ice cream on it
02:03:25.50 --> 02:03:27.50 That thing is it would be illegal
02:03:28.06 --> 02:03:32.94 Yeah, yeah, that might be you know what might psychological warfare might not work
02:03:32.94 --> 02:03:34.94 Not even a arrangement
02:03:35.50 --> 02:03:38.78 That's a watch out for that one. Let's say no that because as of right now
02:03:38.78 --> 02:03:42.46 I think it's 100% success rate actually 101%
02:03:43.50 --> 02:03:47.50 All right, so I heard I heard out in the field reports, but you were saying
02:03:49.82 --> 02:03:54.30 You were saying what that that's the example when to use it. It's not
02:03:55.10 --> 02:03:55.74 Oh
02:03:55.74 --> 02:04:02.86 The example is when you're on the path but you feel like the moment a weakness. Oh, okay. I don't think the chocolate chip that was a conscious decision of yeah
02:04:02.86 --> 02:04:07.42 You know, it's the holidays. I'm gonna do this. You know kind of thing. I'm gonna actually my freedom because of all my discipline
02:04:07.42 --> 02:04:11.42 All that it's like you when you're at work. It's not lunchtime yet. It's almost lunchtime
02:04:11.42 --> 02:04:15.74 But not quite yet boom they got the donuts right because there's some big office meeting
02:04:15.74 --> 02:04:19.02 They want a catering or whatever it's that kind of situation
02:04:19.18 --> 02:04:24.22 You know that's what's good. That's what's good fasting we calibrate that that little hunger vibe
02:04:24.62 --> 02:04:28.22 Unless you hit a speed bump weakness during the fast
02:04:28.94 --> 02:04:34.94 Yeah, then you can by the way. Yeah. Oh, yeah for sure like peanut butter like there would have been fasting the biggest thing
02:04:34.94 --> 02:04:37.10 I think the biggest thing somebody's asking me about it the other day
02:04:38.54 --> 02:04:46.22 The reason he's like what's what's the hardest part like the first eight hours the first 12 hours the first 24 hours and I was like the hardest part of a fast
02:04:46.78 --> 02:04:48.78 Is the parts where you're not doing something
02:04:49.02 --> 02:04:53.34 Yeah, yeah like I haven't thought about eating one time during while we've been recording this podcast
02:04:53.42 --> 02:04:54.94 I haven't thought about eating one time
02:04:54.94 --> 02:04:57.10 When we get done and we
02:04:57.34 --> 02:04:59.34 Square ourselves away and you leave
02:04:59.74 --> 02:05:01.74 I'm gonna be like oh cool. What am I gonna do now?
02:05:01.74 --> 02:05:07.10 You know, yeah, yeah, but then if I was to go from here and like drive to go do something
02:05:07.10 --> 02:05:11.02 I wouldn't think about it. Are you talking about the phone? Yeah, you got something caught on what?
02:05:11.58 --> 02:05:13.58 What how long is this?
02:05:13.58 --> 02:05:18.06 I don't know. I think I'm actually gonna eat this afternoon or this evening. Oh, so you're like, hey, I'm just gonna fast
02:05:18.46 --> 02:05:23.74 What do you have a minimum amount? No, I'll do like 24 hours. You said you 24 hours once a month and then I'll do
02:05:24.94 --> 02:05:26.54 72 hours
02:05:26.54 --> 02:05:28.54 once a quarter
02:05:28.54 --> 02:05:30.54 Yeah, I'll have
02:05:30.54 --> 02:05:32.54 a few handfuls of
02:05:32.70 --> 02:05:37.74 Mix nuts like throughout the Dale Grabo handful of Mix nuts. I'll have some tea
02:05:37.74 --> 02:05:39.74 Some chocolate white tea buzzer
02:05:39.74 --> 02:05:45.10 This is the first one I've done discipline, which I think is really good because it's it's make make me feel great
02:05:45.10 --> 02:05:50.86 So and like there's no calories in order there's one calorie or something really small in there
02:05:51.26 --> 02:05:53.02 Incident
02:05:53.02 --> 02:05:55.74 But yeah and and recalibrate your hunger
02:05:55.74 --> 02:06:04.38 Sensitivities and man, I feel good when I do it. So have you done it? You do 24 hours fast. You feel good. You feel good. No
02:06:05.18 --> 02:06:09.42 Here's the thing wait wait 24 hours yeah, I'm the time for man planning
02:06:09.98 --> 02:06:13.98 I do 24 hours. I actually probably do 24 hours more than once a month because a lot of times I'll just
02:06:14.30 --> 02:06:19.34 Wake up or I'll be traveling and I just won't eat yeah and so I ate the night before I wake up early the morning
02:06:19.34 --> 02:06:21.66 I go I travel I get somewhere at night and then I eat dinner
02:06:21.90 --> 02:06:25.42 Well, that means I just went 24 hours without eating yeah, and that's this
02:06:25.42 --> 02:06:30.14 Kind of essentially kind of how it happened for me early on but after while you're like you know
02:06:30.14 --> 02:06:32.46 The kind where you like dang I'm totally mislunch
02:06:32.62 --> 02:06:36.62 But I don't want to eat now because I won't be hungry for dinner with the family kind of think so I'm like hey
02:06:36.62 --> 02:06:39.02 I'm not gonna eat that I'm like wait. So I just went
02:06:39.50 --> 02:06:40.86 24 hours
02:06:40.86 --> 02:06:47.50 You know what I've noticed this time and like I said it's only been 30-60 hours or no, but what I've noticed this time is the actual
02:06:47.90 --> 02:06:53.10 I felt good about exercising discipline like I felt good about like I'm not eating that because
02:06:53.10 --> 02:06:55.10 Maybe it's because because I
02:06:55.90 --> 02:06:59.34 Just I've been thinking myself like yeah, I don't need to eat right now and that feels good
02:06:59.34 --> 02:07:04.62 I've been actually enjoying the discipline of it. Yeah, which is I know where I don't enjoy the discipline of it
02:07:04.62 --> 02:07:08.54 No matter I haven't I know that I don't know everything thought about it before this time I've been like yes
02:07:08.70 --> 02:07:10.70 Yeah, that makes sense. Oh shut you down
02:07:10.70 --> 02:07:11.90 kind of
02:07:11.90 --> 02:07:16.62 I don't know I know we don't talk about seal training a lot but when you go through hell week
02:07:17.10 --> 02:07:19.42 Which is like when you stay awake for five days
02:07:19.42 --> 02:07:23.50 One of the things that I thought about when I was going through hell week was like oh, it's gonna feel so good to sleep
02:07:23.50 --> 02:07:25.74 And I get done with this that it kind of made me feel good to
02:07:26.46 --> 02:07:30.86 Do it like I was like oh, man. Can you imagine how good it's gonna feel when I've get right this I could go sleep
02:07:30.86 --> 02:07:32.86 It's gonna feel so good and
02:07:32.86 --> 02:07:38.38 Right now I'm kind of like the same thing. I'm kind of thinking off feels so good to not to not eat right now because yeah in two days
02:07:38.38 --> 02:07:40.38 I'm gonna eat
02:07:40.38 --> 02:07:47.82 Yeah, it's the same we have feel strangely not strangely, but same way I feel when I go in vacation or I'm like if I didn't
02:07:47.82 --> 02:07:55.66 Do a lot of work for the you know the past months or whatever like let's say work is like kind of Chris we'll say like you didn't like test me you know how like
02:07:57.90 --> 02:08:02.46 If I shoot all that like at the master I'm kind of shooting all day for 430
02:08:02.46 --> 02:08:04.70 I'm shooting everyone he's talking about taking pictures and
02:08:05.98 --> 02:08:07.98 I'm like where are you shooting?
02:08:07.98 --> 02:08:10.70 I don't shoot guns work. No, I don't nonetheless
02:08:11.02 --> 02:08:16.06 Well you do a few masters you make some being you know in my case, you know you do work and then you're like oh
02:08:16.06 --> 02:08:18.06 You're looking forward to that vacation kind of thing
02:08:18.22 --> 02:08:20.62 But if it's like oh you have a trip land, but you haven't been working that hard
02:08:20.62 --> 02:08:23.90 You're like to brown when I like I want to stock up on a bunch of hard hard work
02:08:23.90 --> 02:08:27.82 So I can enjoy that big game, you know, I mean so the vacation seems more appealing same way
02:08:29.18 --> 02:08:33.42 Feels good. Yeah, give it a try check with your doctors right? I guess what?
02:08:33.82 --> 02:08:39.54 Super free fast. Yeah, sure, but nonetheless if if in back to the speed bump thing if you hit your mom's
02:08:39.54 --> 02:08:45.18 We know where you can carry this threat back to cycle why psychological warfare is good
02:08:45.18 --> 02:08:50.30 Because sometimes he hit those more all that you've said about it. You never said hey you get it on apple iTunes
02:08:51.02 --> 02:08:53.60 Amazon music you never even gave out the goods not yet
02:08:54.10 --> 02:08:59.02 I was about to big time I was about to demonstrate the whole thing, but you already did and I thank you for it because I
02:08:59.02 --> 02:09:02.66 Can do it. All right, hey also on Amazon you can get jocquite
02:09:03.54 --> 02:09:10.86 Which you know there's been a lot of scientific studies done and a lot of people have tried it
02:09:10.86 --> 02:09:16.70 We have witnesses you can absolutely deadlift 8,000 pounds including Jordan Peterson by the way
02:09:16.70 --> 02:09:21.98 Mm-hmm. Yeah, he's been now deadlifting. He's only deadlifting 7,000 pounds before and this is coming from him
02:09:21.98 --> 02:09:28.26 Yeah, now he's deadlifting 8,000 pounds. So that's good. Jocquite. There's some great reviews on there
02:09:28.26 --> 02:09:30.26 You might want to read those
02:09:30.26 --> 02:09:31.26 We got some books
02:09:31.26 --> 02:09:33.26 Way the warrior kid
02:09:33.26 --> 02:09:37.70 Should kids the path the next warrior kid book is coming out April 28
02:09:37.70 --> 02:09:40.70 So you can
02:09:40.70 --> 02:09:44.74 I'll let you know when you can get that I don't know when you can right now, but that's when it's coming out
02:09:44.74 --> 02:09:46.74 I'm done writing it just doing editing now
02:09:47.74 --> 02:09:51.86 And also there's the book talked about earlier extreme ownership
02:09:51.86 --> 02:09:54.10 Rimmma me and my brother life babbin and
02:09:55.50 --> 02:10:00.86 The new additions out combat leadership for business in life. There's a lot of lessons in there
02:10:02.06 --> 02:10:05.18 You can learn from it. I learned from it
02:10:05.18 --> 02:10:10.06 Also the discipline equals freedom field manual
02:10:11.06 --> 02:10:13.06 And when you say that you gotta say it like that
02:10:15.26 --> 02:10:18.62 Because sometimes people don't don't want to say field manual
02:10:19.26 --> 02:10:24.94 But someone pointed I don't know they say this is this book was for him. Yeah, this one was freedom field manual
02:10:26.30 --> 02:10:28.30 A guy who said today
02:10:28.30 --> 02:10:32.78 On social media on Twitter he hit it up and he said hey, it's a field manual
02:10:32.78 --> 02:10:36.66 It's not a book you don't read from cover to cover. It's a field manual
02:10:36.66 --> 02:10:41.94 So you take it out when you need it. Yeah, you refer to it. You go through it. Maybe go through it one time
02:10:42.14 --> 02:10:46.46 Because it's not long not a long read this ain't about face
02:10:47.06 --> 02:10:49.62 by Colonel David Hack worth you can probably read this in
02:10:51.34 --> 02:10:53.34 two hours
02:10:53.34 --> 02:10:55.34 Three hours
02:10:55.34 --> 02:11:04.26 Then once you've read it you go back to it. Yeah, the field manual
02:11:04.26 --> 02:11:10.18 Teaching you how to get after it mentally and physically the thoughts and actions that you can take to get better
02:11:11.02 --> 02:11:15.82 Opportun time a lot of people got it for Christmas now they're implementing new years
