00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.16
This is Jockel Podcast number 105 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:10.24 --> 00:00:13.52
Specialist Viera was witness to scenes of horror.

3
00:00:15.20 --> 00:00:22.32
The enemy was all over, at least a couple hundred of them walking around for three or four minutes. It seemed like three or four hours.

4
00:00:22.32 --> 00:00:28.24
They were shooting and machine gunning or wounded and laughing and giggling.

5
00:00:30.24 --> 00:00:35.76
I knew they'd kill me if they saw I was alive. When they got near, I played dead.

6
00:00:37.20 --> 00:00:44.72
I kept my eyes open and stared at a small tree. I knew that dead men had their eyes open.

7
00:00:44.72 --> 00:00:54.08
Viera continues. Then one of the north Vietnamese came up, looked at me, then kicked me and I flopped over.

8
00:00:55.12 --> 00:01:00.72
I guess he thought I was dead. It was blood running out of my mouth, my arm, my legs.

9
00:01:02.48 --> 00:01:06.16
He took my watch and my 45 caliber pistol and walked on.

10
00:01:06.16 --> 00:01:14.32
I watched them strip off all our weapons. They left, then they left, back where they came from.

11
00:01:15.68 --> 00:01:20.80
I remember the artillery, the bombs, the Nae Palm everywhere, real close around me.

12
00:01:21.84 --> 00:01:27.60
It shook the ground underneath me. But it was coming in on the north Vietnamese soldiers too.

13
00:01:27.60 --> 00:01:41.12
All this and more, much more, took place between 6.50 a.m. and 7.40 a.m. on November 15th, 1965.

14
00:01:42.48 --> 00:01:46.64
The agonies of Charlie Company occurred over 140 yards of the line.

15
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.64
But men were fighting and dying on three sides of our thinly held American perimeter.

16
00:01:52.64 --> 00:01:59.60
In the center, I held the lives of all of these men in my hands.

17
00:02:01.20 --> 00:02:06.32
The badly wounded Captain Bob Edwards was on the radio now asking for reinforcements.

18
00:02:07.28 --> 00:02:10.80
The only reserve I had was a reconnaissance platoon 22 men.

19
00:02:12.24 --> 00:02:18.72
Was the attack on Charlie Company, the main enemy threat, Delta Company and the combined mortar

20
00:02:18.72 --> 00:02:24.80
position were also under attack now. Reluctantly, I told Captain Edwards that his company would

21
00:02:24.80 --> 00:02:31.36
have to fight on alone for the time being. The den of the battle was unbelievable.

22
00:02:32.56 --> 00:02:36.80
Rifles and machine guns and mortars and grenades rattled banged and boomed.

23
00:02:38.08 --> 00:02:44.88
Two batteries of 105 millimeter hoitzers, 12 big guns located on another landing zone,

24
00:02:44.88 --> 00:02:50.96
five miles distant were firing nonstop. Their shells exploding no more than 50 yards outside

25
00:02:50.96 --> 00:02:57.44
the ring of shallow foxholes. Beside me, in the battalion command posts, the Air Force Ford

26
00:02:57.44 --> 00:03:03.36
controller Lieutenant Charlie W. Hastings 26 from La Mesa, New Mexico, Radio to Special Code

27
00:03:03.36 --> 00:03:12.08
Word, Broken Arrow, meaning American unit in danger of being overrun. And within a short period

28
00:03:12.08 --> 00:03:17.76
of time, every available fighter bomber in South Vietnam would stack overhead at a thousand

29
00:03:17.76 --> 00:03:23.36
foot intervals from 7,000 feet to 35,000 feet waiting its turn to deliver bombs and

30
00:03:23.36 --> 00:03:32.08
napoms to the battlefield. Among my sergeants, there were three war men, men who perished

31
00:03:32.08 --> 00:03:38.24
you didn't ignore me on D-Day and had survived the war in Korea. And those old veterans were

32
00:03:38.24 --> 00:03:45.20
shocked by the savagery and hellish noise of this battle. Choking clouds of smoke and dust

33
00:03:45.20 --> 00:03:53.28
obscured the killing ground. We were dry mouthed and our bowels churned with fear and still

34
00:03:53.28 --> 00:04:08.96
the enemy came on in waves. And that right there is from the opening chapter of the book

35
00:04:08.96 --> 00:04:18.88
we were soldiers once and young, by general how more and Joe Galaway. And the book which was

36
00:04:18.88 --> 00:04:28.08
turned into a movie, which I saw when it came out in 2002, Mel Gibson. It's a good movie,

37
00:04:29.04 --> 00:04:37.28
for sure. But it's also a Hollywood movie and Hollywood movies, they're forced to fit

38
00:04:38.88 --> 00:04:43.76
into two hours and they got to follow some kind of a plot and they can't dig into the details

39
00:04:43.76 --> 00:04:49.68
and I can't really give you a comprehensive understanding of the events. And I purposely did not

40
00:04:49.68 --> 00:04:53.76
watch this movie again while preparing for this podcast because I didn't want it in there.

41
00:04:55.12 --> 00:05:02.24
And it went, it in my brain, the movies interpretation of the characters in it and the way

42
00:05:02.24 --> 00:05:12.88
that they were portrayed. And the book is so good. And it's so packed with detail and drama and action

43
00:05:12.88 --> 00:05:22.64
and an utterly incomprehensible heroism. Everyone should read this book.

44
00:05:24.64 --> 00:05:32.88
Everyone. It starts off, it explains the way the battle unfolded and it talks how it went

45
00:05:32.88 --> 00:05:38.48
tactically, operationally and strategically goes through all those levels of warfare.

46
00:05:38.48 --> 00:05:45.36
And you can see in the book how strategy unfolds at the tactical level and how tactical situations

47
00:05:45.36 --> 00:05:50.08
impact strategy is well you can see it on both sides and there's also which is interesting.

48
00:05:50.08 --> 00:05:55.60
There's significant commentary from the Vietnamese enemy leadership that they went back and

49
00:05:55.60 --> 00:06:00.48
interviewed after the war was over. Which just makes it an incredible book and like I said,

50
00:06:00.48 --> 00:06:07.44
everyone should read it. So it tells the story of operations in the I-Drain Valley in 1965

51
00:06:07.44 --> 00:06:20.16
from November 14 until November 18. So five days. But the fighting as was noted in that opening chapter

52
00:06:20.16 --> 00:06:25.44
is absolutely brutal. Leadership is tested over and over and over again.

53
00:06:28.48 --> 00:06:34.24
And this battle took place with battalions and companies from the seventh cavalry

54
00:06:34.24 --> 00:06:41.28
regiment. And if you remember the books we covered on general George Custer, he was a officer

55
00:06:41.28 --> 00:06:46.56
that led seventh cavalry troops in the battle little big horn of where he was surrounded.

56
00:06:47.52 --> 00:06:52.32
And he was killed along with 267 of his soldiers, all of them dead,

57
00:06:53.84 --> 00:07:00.32
by the Native American warriors on the suicide from the Lakota and the Dakota and the northern

58
00:07:00.32 --> 00:07:08.88
Cheyenne and the Arapot tribes. And cavalry in those days meant horseback. That's what

59
00:07:08.88 --> 00:07:17.68
meant. That's what mounted cavalry. That's what it was. And in 1965 they adopted cavalry to a new

60
00:07:17.68 --> 00:07:24.64
kind of seed, a new form of transport and this was the helicopter. And in 1965 they converted the

61
00:07:24.64 --> 00:07:34.16
11th aerosol test division to the first cavalry division. And the first and second battalions

62
00:07:35.12 --> 00:07:42.80
of the first cavalry division soon took on the historical name of General Custer's unit. And

63
00:07:42.80 --> 00:07:47.76
by the way General Custer's seventh calf, even though that's kind of the most famous,

64
00:07:47.76 --> 00:07:55.84
along with this I guess, along with the I drink valley, but the seventh calf served in

65
00:07:55.84 --> 00:08:02.08
World War II and Korea, all kinds of incredible service there. And a lot of that is covered in the

66
00:08:02.08 --> 00:08:11.52
book. But again we'll have to move through this a little bit more quickly. Otherwise,

67
00:08:11.52 --> 00:08:19.76
go read the book, which I highly recommend. But let's get into it starting about where

68
00:08:20.96 --> 00:08:28.64
Lieutenant Colonel Halmore takes over the first battalion at 7th cavalry. Going back to the book.

69
00:08:28.64 --> 00:08:34.08
On Monday, June 29th as scheduled I took command of my battalion. I was 42 years old,

70
00:08:34.08 --> 00:08:39.92
the West Point graduate of the class of 1945 with 19 years commission service, including 14

71
00:08:39.92 --> 00:08:47.76
month tour in Korea, combat tour in Korea. In a brief talk to the troops afterward, I told them that

72
00:08:47.76 --> 00:08:54.40
this was a good battalion, but it would get better. I will do my best, I said, and I expect the same

73
00:08:54.40 --> 00:09:00.72
from each of you. Before taking command, I had a long talk with the most important man in any

74
00:09:00.72 --> 00:09:10.72
battalion, the sergeant major. Basil L. Plumbly, 44 years old, and six and a six foot two-inch

75
00:09:10.72 --> 00:09:18.000
bare of a man hailed from West Virginia. The men sometimes called him old iron jaw, but never in his hearing.

76
00:09:20.88 --> 00:09:26.88
Plumbly was a two-war man and war master parachute wings with his five combat jump stars.

77
00:09:26.88 --> 00:09:34.32
He was what the young airborne types called a Ford jump bastard. Plumbly had survived all four

78
00:09:34.32 --> 00:09:41.44
combat jumps of the 82nd airborne division in World War II, Sicily and Soleno in 1943,

79
00:09:41.44 --> 00:09:49.92
then in 1944, D-Day at Normandy and Market Garden in the Netherlands. For that matter, he also made

80
00:09:49.92 --> 00:09:55.12
one combat parachute jump in the Korean War with 187th airborne infantry regiment.

81
00:09:55.12 --> 00:10:01.20
He ended World War II, a buck sergeant, and was promoted to sergeant major in 1961.

82
00:10:01.76 --> 00:10:07.36
So let's think about that for a minute. Let's think about that. I mean, we've talked,

83
00:10:07.36 --> 00:10:10.24
we've definitely talked about Normandy, we've definitely talked about Market Garden,

84
00:10:11.20 --> 00:10:19.52
he jumped into both those and jumped into Sicily and Soleno, and jumped into combat in the Korean

85
00:10:19.52 --> 00:10:29.04
War. Unbelievable. Going back to the book, the sergeant major was a noble shit guy who believed,

86
00:10:29.04 --> 00:10:35.44
as I did, in tough training, tough discipline, and tough physical conditioning. To this day,

87
00:10:35.44 --> 00:10:40.24
there are veterans of the battalion who are convinced that God may look like sergeant major

88
00:10:40.24 --> 00:10:47.52
basal plumbly, but he isn't nearly as tough as the sergeant major on sins, small or large.

89
00:10:47.52 --> 00:10:52.40
privately, I thanked my lucky stars that I had inherited such a treasure.

90
00:10:53.44 --> 00:10:58.48
I told Sergeant Major Pondley that he had unrestricted access to me at any time

91
00:10:58.48 --> 00:11:04.08
on any subject he wished to raise. After the ceremony, the company commanders and the

92
00:11:04.08 --> 00:11:09.28
battalion staff got to look at their new boss and award on my standards. They were fairly simple.

93
00:11:10.56 --> 00:11:15.44
Only first place trophies will be displayed, accepted, or presented in this battalion.

94
00:11:15.44 --> 00:11:21.04
Second place in our line of work is defeat of the unit on the battlefield and death for the

95
00:11:21.04 --> 00:11:27.68
individual in combat. No fat troops or officers, decision making will be decentralized,

96
00:11:28.24 --> 00:11:36.32
push the power down. It pays off in wartime. Loyalty flows down as well. I check up on everything.

97
00:11:37.04 --> 00:11:42.56
I am available day or night to talk with any officer of this battalion. Finally, the sergeant

98
00:11:42.56 --> 00:11:48.24
major works for only for me and takes orders only for me. He is my right hand man.

99
00:11:49.60 --> 00:11:58.08
So he's set in the stage. Pretty interesting. Not only first place trophies.

100
00:11:58.72 --> 00:12:06.56
Second place. No. Not happening here. Back to the book, the officers of my new battalion were

101
00:12:06.56 --> 00:12:11.76
the usual great army mix of men who had come from their jobs. Come to their jobs from West

102
00:12:11.76 --> 00:12:16.88
Point, ROTC, Officer Candidate School, and Military Schools like the Citadel. Most of the young

103
00:12:16.88 --> 00:12:22.16
second-loop tettids had come through OCS and college ROTC programs. There were three rifle

104
00:12:22.16 --> 00:12:27.20
companies in the battalion, Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie companies. Each had full strength,

105
00:12:27.20 --> 00:12:32.08
supposed to have six officers in a 164-in-listed men. They were my maneuver elements.

106
00:12:32.80 --> 00:12:36.72
Each rifle company had three rifle platoons, plus one platoon of

107
00:12:36.72 --> 00:12:43.04
three 81-millimeter mortar squads for fire support. Each rifle platoon in turn had three rifle

108
00:12:43.04 --> 00:12:49.52
squads, plus a weapon squad of two M60 machine guns for fire support. So there's the breakdown

109
00:12:49.52 --> 00:12:54.48
right there. They also had another combat support company Delta Company,

110
00:12:55.28 --> 00:13:00.48
which had a recon platoon, a mortar platoon and an anti-tank platoon. And they converted the

111
00:13:00.48 --> 00:13:04.56
unneeded anti-tank platoon to the machine gun platoon for for duty in Vietnam because there was no

112
00:13:04.56 --> 00:13:08.000
enemy tanks going up against. So that's what the battalion was looking like.

113
00:13:10.56 --> 00:13:15.28
Going back to the book during the during those first 14 months and now he's going to talk about

114
00:13:15.28 --> 00:13:20.000
their work up a little bit. How they got ready for combat back to the book. During those 14

115
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.56
months before we sailed for Vietnam, we spent most of the time in the field practicing assault

116
00:13:24.56 --> 00:13:28.96
landings from helicopters and the incredibly complex coordination of artillery,

117
00:13:28.96 --> 00:13:35.20
tactical air support and aerial rocket artillery with the all-important flow of helicopters into

118
00:13:35.20 --> 00:13:41.92
an out-of-the-battle zone. Commanders had to learn to see terrain differently, to add a constant

119
00:13:41.92 --> 00:13:48.48
scan for landing zones, which are called LZs and pick-up zones, PZs, to all the other features they

120
00:13:48.48 --> 00:13:54.16
had to keep in mind. We practiced rapid loading and unloading of men and material to reduce the

121
00:13:54.16 --> 00:13:59.76
helicopters window of vulnerability. Total flexibility was the watchword and planning and attitude.

122
00:14:01.12 --> 00:14:06.000
There was one bit of sobering reality that I insisted be introduced at every level in this training.

123
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.60
We would declare a platoon commander dead and let his sergeant take over and carry out the mission.

124
00:14:11.60 --> 00:14:16.64
Or declare a sergeant dead and have one of his PFCs take over running the squad. We were training

125
00:14:16.64 --> 00:14:24.48
for war and leaders are killed in battle. I wanted every man trained for and capable of taking over

126
00:14:24.48 --> 00:14:30.40
the job of the man above him. So they're working a whole new gig here. They never, no one had

127
00:14:30.40 --> 00:14:35.92
really done this before riding everyone's going into combat on helicopters. And obviously helicopters

128
00:14:35.92 --> 00:14:40.08
give you great amount of maneuverability. You can be up vertically and take off and travel a

129
00:14:40.08 --> 00:14:44.32
great distance and set down anywhere or not anywhere just about anywhere. You can set down

130
00:14:44.32 --> 00:14:48.32
in a lot of places. You can't set down anywhere. Especially in the jungle. You've got trees and

131
00:14:48.88 --> 00:14:53.28
all kinds of obstacles and then you've got enemy on top of that. And helicopters are

132
00:14:53.28 --> 00:15:00.08
pretty vulnerable flying machines. And so this idea of what they were practicing was this massive

133
00:15:00.08 --> 00:15:04.88
movement move all the troops into the combat zone very quickly and the enemy doesn't expect you

134
00:15:04.88 --> 00:15:08.96
that you can just shell up there. So that's what they're practicing over and over again.

135
00:15:08.96 --> 00:15:17.20
And clearly a Korean war veteran like how more was he knows that leaders can get killed in combat.

136
00:15:17.20 --> 00:15:22.16
And so he's sometimes killing the leaders and training and that's a tradition we still had.

137
00:15:22.16 --> 00:15:25.60
We did that all the time when I was running training the seal teams. The minute the leaders

138
00:15:25.60 --> 00:15:29.36
started to get a grip on things, it was like, okay, you're dead. Next man's got to step up.

139
00:15:30.32 --> 00:15:35.92
And sometimes that would just wreck a platoon or task unit. The leader dies if they're a good

140
00:15:35.92 --> 00:15:41.12
leader and no one is used to stepping up. It'd be problematic. But sometimes it would actually

141
00:15:41.12 --> 00:15:45.36
be beneficial because you get some guy that's a micromanager killing and then watch everything run

142
00:15:45.36 --> 00:15:49.20
smoothly and you come back and you go dude. You better back off a little bit because this guy's

143
00:15:49.20 --> 00:15:54.88
running a better show than you are. And it's really clear. So sometimes we teach guys lessons that way.

144
00:15:57.28 --> 00:16:01.92
Back to the book. Unfortunately my battalion and every other in the division now began to

145
00:16:01.92 --> 00:16:07.44
suffer the consequences of President Johnson's refusal to declare a state of emergency and extend

146
00:16:07.44 --> 00:16:15.28
the active duty tours of draftees and reserve officers. The order came down. Any soldier who had less

147
00:16:15.28 --> 00:16:21.52
of less, who had 60 days or less left to serve on his enlistment as of the date of deployment

148
00:16:21.52 --> 00:16:28.32
August 16 must be left behind. We were sick at heart. We were being shipped off to war sadly

149
00:16:28.32 --> 00:16:34.64
under strength and crippled by the loss of almost 100 troopers in my battalion alone. The very

150
00:16:34.64 --> 00:16:39.20
men who would be the most useful in combat, those who had trained the longest in the new techniques

151
00:16:39.20 --> 00:16:46.32
of helicopter warfare were by this order taken away from us. It made no sense then. It makes no

152
00:16:46.32 --> 00:16:52.08
sense now. So again I talked about the strategic kind of implications that these guys felt and this

153
00:16:52.08 --> 00:16:56.80
is one of them and obviously I'm jumping through the book. They talked more about the work up and

154
00:16:56.80 --> 00:17:00.88
what they did to prepare. But now he's getting this point where President Johnson doesn't declare

155
00:17:00.88 --> 00:17:08.08
a state of emergency and keep these guys in. That's a political decision obviously. What

156
00:17:08.08 --> 00:17:11.76
it wears an impact? Sure, it impacts the guys on the front line. That's where it impacts.

157
00:17:14.08 --> 00:17:21.92
Now like I said this book is written not only by Lieutenant General Howmore,

158
00:17:21.92 --> 00:17:27.28
it's how he retired in this book. I'll refer to him as Lieutenant Colonel or sometimes I guess I'm just

159
00:17:27.28 --> 00:17:34.88
a disrespectful and call him Howmore. I don't mean it disrespectfully. But anyways, how more

160
00:17:34.88 --> 00:17:40.88
wrote the book. But he also wrote the book along with another guy named Joe Galaway. And you know

161
00:17:40.88 --> 00:17:46.48
what a ghost writer is. Yeah, ghost writer. Well this is so ghost writer writes a person's book

162
00:17:46.48 --> 00:17:50.56
but no one's supposed to know it. And then there's people that write the book but they get credit for it.

163
00:17:50.56 --> 00:17:55.60
And you might think that's a situation here looking at the title because you've got Lieutenant General

164
00:17:55.60 --> 00:18:01.92
Howerald More retired and Joseph L. Galaway. Like, you know, it doesn't say any service thing. Well

165
00:18:04.24 --> 00:18:09.76
in this particular case that could give you an absolutely wrong impression because Joe Galaway

166
00:18:09.76 --> 00:18:16.24
was a reporter, a combat reporter who was obviously he was very courageous and

167
00:18:16.24 --> 00:18:23.68
and basically got after it for lack of a better word. So I'll go in where they introduce him a

168
00:18:23.68 --> 00:18:30.000
little bit back to the book. UPI reporter Joe Galaway, a 23-year-old native of Refugeeotexus,

169
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.60
marched with us. When he hooked up with us, he carried on a shoulder an M-16 rifle, which the

170
00:18:35.60 --> 00:18:42.40
special forces commander made your Charles Beckworth had handed him when the fight was over.

171
00:18:42.40 --> 00:18:47.68
Galaway told Beckworth that strictly speaking under the Geneva Convention, he was a civilian

172
00:18:47.68 --> 00:18:53.84
non-combatant, Beckwith's response, no such thing in these mountains. Boy, take that rifle.

173
00:18:54.40 --> 00:19:00.000
So if you know anything about Charles Beckworth major Charlie Beckworth, it's the guy that created

174
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:08.08
Delta Force, complete badass warrior and he was a special forces commander in Vietnam and was one of

175
00:19:08.08 --> 00:19:11.92
the first people that apparently Galaway worked with and Galaway said, you know, you better arm

176
00:19:11.92 --> 00:19:20.88
yourself. So here's Galaway talking. Galaway remembers. My first time out with Halmore's first

177
00:19:20.88 --> 00:19:26.32
Italian seventh cavalry was a hellish walk into the sun to a remote Montagarde mountain village.

178
00:19:26.96 --> 00:19:31.84
We got into a patch of brush and wait a minute vine so thick and phony that every step had to be

179
00:19:31.84 --> 00:19:37.84
carved out with machetes. We covered maybe 300 yards in four hours and forwarded a fast running

180
00:19:37.84 --> 00:19:43.04
chest deep mountain stream just as darkness fell then huddled in our poncho's wet and freezing

181
00:19:43.04 --> 00:19:48.56
all night long. At first light I pinched off a small piece of C4 plastic explosive from the

182
00:19:48.56 --> 00:19:53.36
emergency supply in my pack and used it to boil up a canteen of water for coffee.

183
00:19:54.80 --> 00:20:00.24
If you lit C4 very carefully, you could be drinking hot coffee in maybe 30 seconds if you were careless,

184
00:20:00.24 --> 00:20:06.24
it blew off your arm. Over a first cigarette I watched Moore's men.

185
00:20:06.24 --> 00:20:13.84
First they shaved. Shaved up here I was amazed. Then the Colonel himself blonde,

186
00:20:13.84 --> 00:20:21.04
jet-jod and very intense. A son of barge-down Kentucky and West Point walked by on this morning

187
00:20:21.04 --> 00:20:26.64
rounds with the sergeant made with sergeant major plumbly. Moore looked to me over and said,

188
00:20:26.64 --> 00:20:33.28
we all shave in my outfit. Reporters included. My steaming coffee water went for a wash and a shave

189
00:20:33.28 --> 00:20:40.000
and I gained a measure of respect for the man. Daily discipline and all things.

190
00:20:41.12 --> 00:20:44.56
You know that's another thing that I failed to mention but it's very clear when you read the book

191
00:20:44.56 --> 00:20:52.72
is this is 1965 and the war had not escalated at all and it wasn't the meat grinder that it

192
00:20:52.72 --> 00:20:59.04
turned into. So these guys you know in their workup they knew that they were going to fight but

193
00:20:59.04 --> 00:21:05.92
they didn't know it wasn't the Vietnam that we think of now where there's a lot of casualties happening.

194
00:21:05.92 --> 00:21:10.16
It hadn't gotten there yet. It's a matter of fact this battle is really the first one where

195
00:21:10.16 --> 00:21:20.72
that where you start seeing very significant American casualties. The guy that's in charge over

196
00:21:21.52 --> 00:21:26.88
how over how Moore is a guy named Colonel Brown and he shows up going back to the book

197
00:21:26.88 --> 00:21:31.12
not long after Colonel Brown flew in check on the situation with Alpha Company then called me

198
00:21:31.12 --> 00:21:38.56
aside. How I'm moving your battalion west tomorrow morning. He said unfolding his map. Here is your

199
00:21:38.56 --> 00:21:45.12
area of operations north of Chu Pong and the I-Drain Valley. Your missions the same one you have now

200
00:21:45.12 --> 00:21:51.76
find and kill the enemy. He rapidly outlined the scope of operations and the resources he could spare

201
00:21:51.76 --> 00:22:02.000
16 UH 1D Hueies. So that's a Huey helicopter. It's the most Iconic helicopter

202
00:22:02.88 --> 00:22:10.56
probably of any military and certainly of Vietnam the Huey helicopter is is completely iconic.

203
00:22:11.52 --> 00:22:17.52
16 Hueies to move my troops to 105 Hours or batteries within range to support us and at least two days

204
00:22:17.52 --> 00:22:25.36
on the ground patrolling. He added that Alpha Company of the 229th Helicopter Battalion would provide

205
00:22:25.36 --> 00:22:32.72
the helicopters. The 229th A company commander Major Bruce Crandell was on his way now.

206
00:22:33.36 --> 00:22:38.56
One more thing how in that area be sure your companies are close enough for mutual support.

207
00:22:38.56 --> 00:22:49.04
So the reason I highlighted that a lot of times people have a tendency in combat situations,

208
00:22:49.04 --> 00:22:53.60
especially when planning to get too far apart from each other. Then I would see this all the time.

209
00:22:53.60 --> 00:22:59.44
And what happens is it seems to make sense because you cover more ground or you have better angles

210
00:22:59.44 --> 00:23:03.04
and it seems like a good idea like hey we'll just split up and you can take care of your guys and

211
00:23:03.04 --> 00:23:09.68
I'll take care of my guys but you always need to stay within a position where you can mutually support each

212
00:23:09.68 --> 00:23:13.92
other. Where if we get a trouble we can cover move that's what it is. You want to be able to cover to

213
00:23:13.92 --> 00:23:19.04
move cover move. So the minute you're out of sight, out of line of sight, out of radio,

214
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.28
out of the out of a distance where your weapons can be used to support your alone.

215
00:23:26.32 --> 00:23:30.48
That's the thing. You get away from line of sight, radio contact,

216
00:23:30.48 --> 00:23:36.64
the distance that weapons can be shot effectively from the other unit that you're out there with.

217
00:23:36.64 --> 00:23:43.76
Now you are alone. So when you're planning, make sure and he's saying in that area,

218
00:23:43.76 --> 00:23:52.32
I always use that rule. As often as possible, are there times where you can flex that rule a little

219
00:23:52.32 --> 00:23:56.80
bit? Of course there are situations you can get into and you might be a better tactical call,

220
00:23:56.80 --> 00:24:02.16
but always keep in mind what you're doing and what you're sacrificing when you can no longer

221
00:24:02.16 --> 00:24:08.16
mutually support the other units out you're out with and they can't mutually support you.

222
00:24:08.16 --> 00:24:14.72
You're alone. So he knows this is going to be a little bit of a hot area.

223
00:24:14.72 --> 00:24:18.64
At least he expects it. Going back to the book, how ready was my batalion for combat?

224
00:24:19.44 --> 00:24:23.44
We had never maneuvered in combat as an entire battalion. Although all three rifle companies

225
00:24:23.44 --> 00:24:27.84
had been minor scrapes. So they've been in Vietnam for a while. They've been in a little bit of

226
00:24:27.84 --> 00:24:32.40
contact, but nothing too major. And like you just said, none of them had been.

227
00:24:32.40 --> 00:24:35.68
Then they've been out as a group as a battalion. Back to the book, most of them

228
00:24:35.68 --> 00:24:42.40
had never seen an enemy soldier dead or alive. We had killed fewer than 10 black pajama gorillas

229
00:24:42.40 --> 00:24:48.32
in the get acquainted patrols and small operations since our arrival. The four line companies had

230
00:24:48.32 --> 00:24:55.20
20 of their authorized 23 officers. But the enlisted ranks have been badly whittled down by

231
00:24:55.20 --> 00:25:01.20
expiring enlistments, malaria cases and requirements for base camp guards and workers

232
00:25:02.24 --> 00:25:10.96
back in an K. Alpha Company had 115 men, 49 fewer than authorized. Bravo company at 114 men was

233
00:25:10.96 --> 00:25:17.60
50 short. Charlie Company had 106 men down by 58. And the weapons company Delta had only

234
00:25:17.60 --> 00:25:24.48
76 men 42 fewer than authorized. Headquarters company was also under strength and I had been forced

235
00:25:24.48 --> 00:25:29.52
to draw down further by sending men out to fill crucial medical and communication

236
00:25:29.52 --> 00:25:36.08
as vacancies in the line companies. I didn't like being short-handed, but things had been

237
00:25:36.08 --> 00:25:41.92
no different in the Korean War than somehow we made do. You just suck it up and do it.

238
00:25:41.92 --> 00:25:50.08
And we would do the same way in the eye-drying. The officers and NCOs would do what they could

239
00:25:50.08 --> 00:25:55.84
to make up the slack just as we had done in Korea. So my point of reading that, these guys are

240
00:25:55.84 --> 00:26:04.16
heavily undermined. Suppose to have 150 people in the have 105 or whatever. And there's nothing

241
00:26:04.16 --> 00:26:09.28
to do about it. And it's also interesting in worth noting that he has a headquarters company, so you

242
00:26:09.28 --> 00:26:15.92
got the battalion commander and he's got a group of guys that do weapons for him and also communications.

243
00:26:15.92 --> 00:26:21.92
And he's pushed those guys out. So instead of keeping those guys and making him his own team,

244
00:26:21.92 --> 00:26:27.44
all fat and happy, note that he makes his team thin and gives as much as he can to the forces

245
00:26:27.44 --> 00:26:34.80
that are out in the field. So another good note on leadership. Now they're getting ready to roll in

246
00:26:34.80 --> 00:26:43.12
and we will talk about he's kind of going through the plan a little bit. Here we go back to the book.

247
00:26:43.12 --> 00:26:46.88
I would personally land on the first helicopter piloted by Bruce Crandell and Bruce Crandell's

248
00:26:46.88 --> 00:26:51.68
the commander of the helicopters that are flying them in. That would permit me a final low-level

249
00:26:51.68 --> 00:26:55.76
look at the landing zone and surrounding terrain. And with Crandell and the front seat and me and

250
00:26:55.76 --> 00:27:00.40
the back, we could work out on the spot any last minute diversion to an alternate lander's

251
00:27:00.40 --> 00:27:06.08
landing zone if necessary and fix any other problems with the lift. In the American Civil War,

252
00:27:06.08 --> 00:27:10.48
it was a matter of principle that a good officer rode his horse as little as possible.

253
00:27:11.36 --> 00:27:15.84
There were sound reasons for this. If you are riding and your soldiers are marching,

254
00:27:15.84 --> 00:27:21.44
how can you judge how tired they are, how thirsty, how heavy their packs weigh on their shoulders.

255
00:27:22.24 --> 00:27:27.12
I applied the same philosophy in Vietnam where every battalion commander had his own command and

256
00:27:27.12 --> 00:27:31.92
control helicopter. Some commanders used their helicopter as their personal mount.

257
00:27:33.28 --> 00:27:37.36
I never believed in that. You had to get on the ground with your troops to see and hear what was

258
00:27:37.36 --> 00:27:43.20
happening. You have to soak up firsthand information for your instincts to operate accurately.

259
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Besides, it's too easy to be crisp, cool, and detached at 1500 feet. Too easy to man the

260
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:57.28
impossible of your troops. Too easy to make mistakes that are fatal only to those souls far below in the mud,

261
00:27:57.28 --> 00:28:02.72
the blood and confusion. This is something we talk about all the time from the leadership perspective.

262
00:28:02.72 --> 00:28:10.80
You cannot be, it's the dichotomy of detachment. It does pay and there are certain times where you can tell

263
00:28:11.52 --> 00:28:15.36
in these situations, if you're in the command helicopter that's up above the fighting,

264
00:28:15.36 --> 00:28:21.44
well, you're defacto. You are detached from the situation. You can see what's happening and you have

265
00:28:22.96 --> 00:28:28.32
you have a good view of what's going on. But even though you have a good view, you're also missing

266
00:28:28.32 --> 00:28:31.92
a bunch. You're missing what it's like down there. You're missing what the men are seeing. You're

267
00:28:31.92 --> 00:28:35.12
missing what it looks like to them. You're missing the communication breakdowns that are happening

268
00:28:35.12 --> 00:28:46.48
down there. So you have to find that balance between these two and he clearly is aware of that.

269
00:28:47.36 --> 00:28:55.28
Preparing for this and he's got a book called Street Without Joy by a guy named Bernard

270
00:28:55.28 --> 00:29:05.76
Fall and it's a book about Vietnam. It's a book about the tragedy that the French troops went through

271
00:29:05.76 --> 00:29:11.68
fighting the Vietnamese and he says that he took one lesson away from that book and this is the lesson.

272
00:29:11.68 --> 00:29:19.28
Death is the price you pay for underestimating this tenacious enemy. So he was aware and like

273
00:29:19.28 --> 00:29:23.44
General Mattis said, you know, not too long ago they were talking about General Mattis and how

274
00:29:23.44 --> 00:29:28.08
coming read so many books and he says because I get to see I get to learn and this is a classic case.

275
00:29:28.64 --> 00:29:34.56
He knew he read books about the French that had fought the Vietnamese what ten years earlier,

276
00:29:34.56 --> 00:29:41.44
eleven years earlier and that made him more prepared. Now talking a little bit like I said,

277
00:29:41.44 --> 00:29:47.60
there's a there's great information in here about the enemy and like I said, they went and

278
00:29:47.60 --> 00:29:54.24
interviewed and got reports from the enemy and here we go a little bit about the enemy.

279
00:29:54.24 --> 00:30:00.64
Back to the book the soldiers commanded by Brigadier General Chu, Chuui, Man had been training

280
00:30:00.64 --> 00:30:05.44
for more than 18 months. When they joined the people's army each recruit was issued two

281
00:30:05.44 --> 00:30:11.76
khaki shirts, two pairs of khaki trousers, a sewing kit and a pair of Ho Chi Minh sandals cut from

282
00:30:11.76 --> 00:30:19.84
used tire trucks. Those uniforms were expected in the last five years. Basic training lasted 13

283
00:30:19.84 --> 00:30:25.68
weeks, six days, a week, six a.m. to nine, 15 p.m. The instructors emphasized weapons and tactics,

284
00:30:25.68 --> 00:30:31.52
the house of warfare while the political commissars had time had time set aside each day to

285
00:30:31.52 --> 00:30:37.20
lecture on the wise of this war. The recruits were reminded constantly that their fathers had beaten

286
00:30:37.20 --> 00:30:43.20
the French colonialists. Now it was their duty to defeat the American imperialists. They were

287
00:30:43.20 --> 00:30:48.08
imbued with Ho Chi Minh's dictum. Nothing is more precious than freedom and independence.

288
00:30:49.76 --> 00:30:54.96
After basic training, some were selected for six months of NCO school and would emerge as new

289
00:30:54.96 --> 00:30:59.84
corporals for the rest advanced infantry training included familiarization with all weapons,

290
00:30:59.84 --> 00:31:05.60
the use of explosive ambush tactics, reconnaissance tactics, adjusting mortar fire and patrol

291
00:31:05.60 --> 00:31:13.20
tactics. In June of 1964, man soldiers moved up into the mountains of North Vietnam to rain similar

292
00:31:13.20 --> 00:31:18.96
to that in western highlands of South Vietnam. Here, physical conditioning was emphasized. They

293
00:31:18.96 --> 00:31:24.56
scaled steep slopes while wearing rock sacks loaded with 50 to 60 pounds of rocks. Their advance

294
00:31:24.56 --> 00:31:30.72
training now also focused on the art of camouflage. When the time came for them to begin the

295
00:31:30.72 --> 00:31:36.08
arduous two-month journey down the Ho Chi Minh Trail through Louss, General Man's Regiment broke down

296
00:31:36.08 --> 00:31:41.76
into battalions for security purposes, each moving separately at least three days ahead of the

297
00:31:41.76 --> 00:31:47.92
next. Each soldier carried four pounds of rice, seven days rations, plus another eight pounds of

298
00:31:47.92 --> 00:31:52.88
foodstuffs that were expected to last in the whole trip. Two pounds of salt, two pounds of wheat

299
00:31:52.88 --> 00:31:59.76
flour, and four pounds of salt pork. One man in every squad carried the aluminum cook pot that would

300
00:31:59.76 --> 00:32:05.52
that the squad's rice would be boiled in. Each man also carried 50 anti-malaria pills,

301
00:32:05.52 --> 00:32:11.76
one for each day on the trail, and a hundred vitamin B1 tabs to be taken at the rate of three per week.

302
00:32:12.72 --> 00:32:17.84
Despite the pills virtually every man who walked the trail contracting malaria and on average

303
00:32:17.84 --> 00:32:22.16
three or four soldiers of each one hundred and sixty man company would die on the journey.

304
00:32:23.20 --> 00:32:28.64
Malaria, diarrhea, accidents, poisonous snakes and American error raids took their toll.

305
00:32:30.24 --> 00:32:36.24
Man's soldiers marched nine miles each day, the distance between rest camps where they spent each night.

306
00:32:37.36 --> 00:32:42.40
Every day, every fourth day they stayed in camp, taking the day off to rest up,

307
00:32:42.40 --> 00:32:49.04
wash their clothes, and tend to minor medical problems. So this is a legit enemy. We're looking at

308
00:32:49.04 --> 00:33:02.96
legit enemy organized, well trained, hard, tough, well led, and ready. And you can't ever,

309
00:33:02.96 --> 00:33:06.64
you know, this is one of the biggest problems with fighting a counterinsurgency, as you're going

310
00:33:06.64 --> 00:33:10.72
against someone that's fighting on their own turf. And that is just, you can't, how do you overcome

311
00:33:10.72 --> 00:33:14.40
that advantage? Well, you overcome that advantage with firepower and with some technology,

312
00:33:14.40 --> 00:33:21.92
but that is a hard advantage to overcome. Yeah. And here's a quote from General Anne,

313
00:33:23.36 --> 00:33:28.80
when you landed there, you landed right in the middle of three of our battalions of the 66th

314
00:33:28.80 --> 00:33:36.08
regimen, our service, our reserve force. It was the strongest we had. At full strength, the battalions

315
00:33:36.08 --> 00:33:42.40
each had about 450 men. Also, there was a headquarters battalion. The regimen's total strength

316
00:33:42.40 --> 00:33:52.32
was about 1600 men. So there, kind of by chance, set up on the same spot where these guys are

317
00:33:52.32 --> 00:34:04.24
going to go in, which is LZX-ray, landing zone X-ray. And here, they're flying into the LZX-ray.

318
00:34:04.24 --> 00:34:09.92
Captain John Herron, whose Bravo Company troops filled the helicopter recalls it was a cool,

319
00:34:09.92 --> 00:34:15.20
it was a misty cool morning with some low-hanging fog when we lifted off. But shortly after take off,

320
00:34:15.20 --> 00:34:20.96
we broke into the clear and you could see the 105 artillery pounding the areas around the LZX

321
00:34:20.96 --> 00:34:27.76
we headed in. Vietnam, even in war, was scenic, with green jungle, heavy forested mountains,

322
00:34:27.76 --> 00:34:37.92
and wild looking rivers, crisscrossing the terrain. Now the helicopters of the aerial rocket artillery

323
00:34:37.92 --> 00:34:45.52
slam the perimeter with rockets, grenades, and machine gun fire using 24 of the 48, 2.7 inch rockets

324
00:34:45.52 --> 00:34:51.84
they carried. So it's the same thing that we've heard before it's cover move, right? As you come into

325
00:34:51.84 --> 00:34:57.92
a landing zone, like they did in D-Day, what do you do first? You bomb the crap out of it. You hit it

326
00:34:57.92 --> 00:35:01.76
with naval gunfire and they're doing the same thing here. They're prepping the landing zone by

327
00:35:01.76 --> 00:35:08.24
dropping a bunch of 105 ha, into the surrounding area around the landing zone, and then the

328
00:35:08.24 --> 00:35:13.20
helicopters, once it's too close, and the, and the hawitzers have to turn off, then the helicopter

329
00:35:13.20 --> 00:35:17.76
starts shooting, and they do their best to clear the area around the landing zone. That's what's going on.

330
00:35:17.76 --> 00:35:25.92
Back to the book, The People's Army Commander on the battlefield, then senior Lieutenant Colonel

331
00:35:25.92 --> 00:35:32.80
Nguyen, who on, says, when you drop troops into X-ray, I was on Tupong Mountain. We had a very

332
00:35:32.80 --> 00:35:39.92
strong position and a strong mobile command group. We were ready. We were ready. Had prepared for you

333
00:35:39.92 --> 00:35:46.24
and expected you to come. The only question was when? The trees and bush limited our view of the

334
00:35:46.24 --> 00:35:51.36
helicopters landing, but we had an observation post on top of the mountain, and they reported to us

335
00:35:51.36 --> 00:35:58.72
when you drop troops and when you move them. So, man, you know, I talk about all the time about

336
00:35:59.44 --> 00:36:04.96
having the high ground, well, these guys are landing in a valley, and they're surrounded by

337
00:36:04.96 --> 00:36:12.64
high ground. So, you're at your tactical disadvantage there. Right as soon as, just about as soon

338
00:36:12.64 --> 00:36:17.60
as I hit the ground, they're there for a little while and they get a prisoner. The Americans

339
00:36:17.60 --> 00:36:24.48
get a prisoner, and here's there's a translator, and he translates the prisoners' words, and here's

340
00:36:24.48 --> 00:36:29.28
what the prisoner says. Well, here's what the translator says. He says there are three battalions

341
00:36:29.28 --> 00:36:32.80
on the mountain who want very much to kill Americans, but have not been able to find any.

342
00:36:35.60 --> 00:36:40.96
Now, you take that with a grain of salt, because it's coming from a prisoner, but it's not nothing.

343
00:36:40.96 --> 00:36:46.80
I'll put it to you that way. It's something. Back to the books, only a few rifle shots,

344
00:36:46.80 --> 00:36:52.24
rang out in the area where the prisoner had been captured. Sergeant Gilrod's men were in contact.

345
00:36:52.24 --> 00:36:57.44
It was now 1215 PM. We had to move fast if we were going to survive, had to get off the landing

346
00:36:57.44 --> 00:37:02.72
zone, and hit them before they could hit us. Only if we brought the enemy to battle deep in the

347
00:37:02.72 --> 00:37:07.92
trees and brush, could we stand even a slim chance of holding onto the clearing and getting the rest

348
00:37:07.92 --> 00:37:13.60
to the battalion landed. That football field size clearing was our lifeline and our supply line.

349
00:37:13.60 --> 00:37:19.20
If the enemy closed away to the helicopters, all of us would die in this place. So that's one of the

350
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.04
one of the hard things about helicopter warfare, especially in Vietnam, well, actually anywhere,

351
00:37:25.04 --> 00:37:28.96
is you get great. You can go along distance and get in there, but then once you're there,

352
00:37:30.24 --> 00:37:34.48
if the helicopters can't come get you out, or they can't resupply you're in real

353
00:37:34.48 --> 00:37:40.80
problem, you're back to the word that I said earlier, you're alone. Back to the book, even as the

354
00:37:40.80 --> 00:37:45.52
first shots rang out, I was raiding you and heron to saddle up the rest of the rubble company.

355
00:37:45.52 --> 00:37:50.16
The rest of his his rubble company met a move out fast toward the mountain to develop the situation.

356
00:37:50.16 --> 00:37:56.24
Turning to Nendal and he's again, there's all these characters. I mean, there's all the

357
00:37:56.24 --> 00:38:00.72
company commanders, the platoon commanders, the platoon leaders, the platoon sergeants, there's the

358
00:38:00.72 --> 00:38:05.36
ground troops, there's all these characters. And the book doesn't outstanding job of

359
00:38:05.36 --> 00:38:09.36
detailing who all these individuals were. What they're back on was where they came from,

360
00:38:10.40 --> 00:38:14.88
and I just don't, we can't do that right now, but that's why you buy the book and you read the book.

361
00:38:16.32 --> 00:38:22.08
But this guy in Adal is one of the company commanders. So here we go, turning to Adal.

362
00:38:22.08 --> 00:38:26.56
I told him that the original plan was out the window that his alpha company should immediately

363
00:38:26.56 --> 00:38:31.44
take over L.C. security and get ready to move up on Bravo Company's left when Charlie

364
00:38:31.44 --> 00:38:35.68
went enough of Charlie Company to arrive down the next lift to assume the job of securing and clearing.

365
00:38:35.68 --> 00:38:43.12
So classic, you hit the ground and now all the sudden the plan is out the window, right?

366
00:38:43.12 --> 00:38:46.96
Out the window. We're going with our standard operating procedures, which is hey, we're going to

367
00:38:46.96 --> 00:38:51.60
move a company here, you're going to set up perimeter security and go. Back to the book and the

368
00:38:51.60 --> 00:38:59.36
small cops, the other two platoon, platoons of Bravo Company men had open sea rash and cans,

369
00:38:59.36 --> 00:39:04.08
and we're grabbing a bite when they heard the first shots in the brush. The older sergeants

370
00:39:04.08 --> 00:39:08.48
glance at one another and nodded. Eat fast, they told the men, and get ready to move.

371
00:39:09.36 --> 00:39:12.32
The battle of L.C. X-ray had just begun.

372
00:39:12.32 --> 00:39:21.04
And it doesn't take long to begin going back to the book says sergeant Gil Reeth,

373
00:39:22.32 --> 00:39:27.92
we were virtually pinned to the ground and taken casualties. Lieutenant Dennis Deal remembers that moment.

374
00:39:28.88 --> 00:39:33.60
Devny's platoon was taking moderate fire. We could all hear it through the foliage and I heard

375
00:39:33.60 --> 00:39:39.76
it crackling on my radio. Owls and some sort of trouble, the firing increased in volume and

376
00:39:39.76 --> 00:39:45.68
intensity. Then I saw my first wounded trooper, probably the first American wounded in L.C. X-ray.

377
00:39:46.56 --> 00:39:51.92
He was shot in the neck or mouth or both was still carrying his rifle, was ambulatory,

378
00:39:51.92 --> 00:39:56.64
and appeared stunned at what had happened to him. When he asked where to go, I put my arm around

379
00:39:56.64 --> 00:40:03.52
and pointed to where I'd last seen the batide commander. So it's immediately on and you of course

380
00:40:03.52 --> 00:40:19.36
it is because there's three battalions of Vietnamese soldiers there. And this is how more talking

381
00:40:19.36 --> 00:40:23.52
back to the book, the military historian S.L.A. Marshall wrote that at the beginning of a battle,

382
00:40:23.52 --> 00:40:28.96
units fractionalized, groping between the antagonist takes place and the battle takes form from

383
00:40:28.96 --> 00:40:33.76
all of this. Marshall had it right. That is precisely what was happening up in the scrub,

384
00:40:33.76 --> 00:40:41.44
brush a rub above landing zone X-ray this day. And no other single event would have greater impact

385
00:40:41.44 --> 00:40:45.84
on the shape of this battle than what Lieutenant Henry Herrick was in the process of doing.

386
00:40:46.56 --> 00:40:51.28
Herrick charged right past Lieutenant Devny's men, swung his platoon to the right in

387
00:40:51.28 --> 00:40:57.04
hop pursuit of a few fleeting enemy soldiers and disappeared from sight into the bush.

388
00:40:57.04 --> 00:41:04.08
Says Sergeant Ernie Savage of Herrick's orders, he made a bad decision. And we knew at the time it

389
00:41:04.08 --> 00:41:08.72
was a bad decision. We were breaking contact with the rest of the company. We were supposed to

390
00:41:08.72 --> 00:41:14.000
come up on the flank of First Platoon. In fact, we were moving away from them. We lost contact

391
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:21.52
with everyone, everybody. So again, this is what I just talked about. And it's, you're going to

392
00:41:21.52 --> 00:41:28.32
see throughout this book, all these principles that we talk about all the time that that we taught

393
00:41:28.32 --> 00:41:32.48
and that we live through. You can see that these types of things happen. And here's a classic

394
00:41:32.48 --> 00:41:37.12
thing I was just talking about. Like when you get out of distance from your supporting elements,

395
00:41:37.12 --> 00:41:47.28
you're now alone. And that's a bad situation to be in. Back to the book. Now, John Herron was

396
00:41:47.28 --> 00:41:52.000
up on my radio reporting that his men were under heavy attack by at least two enemy companies. And that

397
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.84
his second platoon was in danger of being surrounded and caught off from the rest of the company.

398
00:41:56.48 --> 00:42:02.64
Even as he spoke, more than rocket rounds hit in the clearing where I stood. My worst case scenario

399
00:42:02.64 --> 00:42:07.52
had just come to pass. We were now in a heavy contact before all my battalion was on the ground.

400
00:42:08.08 --> 00:42:13.44
And now I had to deal with a cutoff platoon. My response was an angry shit.

401
00:42:13.44 --> 00:42:19.68
Captain John Herron's estimate that his bravo company men were trying to deal with two enemy

402
00:42:19.68 --> 00:42:25.60
companies with slightly off. One full enemy battalion, more than 500 determined enemy soldiers,

403
00:42:25.60 --> 00:42:30.80
was boiling down the mountain toward Herrick's trap second platoon and maneuvering near Aldivini's

404
00:42:30.80 --> 00:42:37.76
pin down first platoon. Again, here's something that I failed to talk about with helicopter warfare.

405
00:42:37.76 --> 00:42:47.44
So he's got a battalion of 500 guys, 550 guys. You can't fit all those guys on 16 helicopters.

406
00:42:47.44 --> 00:42:54.000
So you've got to do multiple laps. And that's what he's he's worried. He was worried about it going in.

407
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.76
That, hey, I want to get my whole battalion on the ground before the fighting starts.

408
00:42:57.76 --> 00:43:02.16
He's already failed to do that. Or maybe he hasn't failed to do it, but it didn't happen.

409
00:43:02.16 --> 00:43:10.16
Back to the book, I was tempted to join the dolls or Edwards men, but resisted the temptation.

410
00:43:10.16 --> 00:43:15.12
I had no business getting involved with the actions of only one company. I might get pin down

411
00:43:15.12 --> 00:43:20.24
and simply become another rifleman. My duty was to lead rifleman. So there's a,

412
00:43:21.44 --> 00:43:25.92
you know, we talked about the detachment that he said, hey, look, I'm not going to be up in the helicopter,

413
00:43:25.92 --> 00:43:29.44
but right now he's saying, look, I'm not going to be in the helicopter overhead at 1500 feet,

414
00:43:29.44 --> 00:43:34.96
but I'm not going to be sitting in a platoon as a rifleman slugging it out with the enemy. That's not

415
00:43:34.96 --> 00:43:38.72
the right place to be either. You have to lead in, in order to lead, you have to take a step back. You have to

416
00:43:38.72 --> 00:43:44.16
detach. And he does that to the best of his ability. And here we go back to the book. Just now,

417
00:43:44.16 --> 00:43:48.64
the snaps and cracks are the rounds passing nearby took on a distinctly different sound, like a swarm of

418
00:43:48.64 --> 00:43:54.08
bees around our heads. I was on the radio trying to hear a transmission over the noise when I felt the

419
00:43:54.08 --> 00:44:00.000
firm hand on my right soldier shoulder. It was sergeant major plumblies. He shouted over the

420
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.24
racket of the firefight. Sir, if you don't find some cover, you're going to go down. And if you go

421
00:44:04.24 --> 00:44:12.16
down, we all go down. Plumbly was right as always. Anyone waving, yelling, hand signaling, or talking

422
00:44:12.16 --> 00:44:18.64
on the radio was instantly targeted by the enemy. These guys were quick to spot and shoot leaders,

423
00:44:18.64 --> 00:44:25.76
radio operators, and medics. I'd never fret about being wounded in combat in Korea or here,

424
00:44:25.76 --> 00:44:31.28
but plumbly brought me up short. The game was just beginning. This was no time for me to go out of it.

425
00:44:31.92 --> 00:44:36.88
The sergeant major pointed to a large termite hill. Six or seven feet high, located in some

426
00:44:36.88 --> 00:44:42.40
trees in the waist between the two open areas of the landing zone. It was about 30 yards away.

427
00:44:42.40 --> 00:44:47.44
And three of us turned and ran toward it with bullets kicking up red dirt around our feet. And

428
00:44:47.44 --> 00:44:53.12
the bees still buzzing around our heads. That termite hill, the size of a large automobile,

429
00:44:53.12 --> 00:44:58.48
would become the battalion command post. The aid station, the supply point, the collection area

430
00:44:58.48 --> 00:45:03.36
for enemy prisoners, weapons and equipment, and the place where our dead were brought.

431
00:45:05.36 --> 00:45:09.52
Casualties were now beginning to pile up. As we drop behind that termite hill, I fleetingly

432
00:45:09.52 --> 00:45:15.76
thought about an illustration, an illustrious predecessor of mine in the seventh cavalry,

433
00:45:15.76 --> 00:45:21.52
Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer. And his final stay, stand in the valley of

434
00:45:21.52 --> 00:45:28.24
Little Binghorn in Montana 89 years earlier. I was determined that history would not repeat

435
00:45:28.24 --> 00:45:34.32
itself in the valley of the eyedrain. We were a tight well trained and disciplined fighting force,

436
00:45:34.32 --> 00:45:39.60
and we had one thing George Custer did not have. Fire support.

437
00:45:39.60 --> 00:45:48.56
Fire support plays. It's beyond critical. I mean, they would not have been able to do this

438
00:45:48.56 --> 00:45:54.000
without fire support. And that's the one thing that's going to save them. I mean,

439
00:45:54.72 --> 00:45:59.28
obviously the discipline, obviously the training, obviously the bravery, but the fire support is

440
00:46:00.64 --> 00:46:08.96
a gift. Back to the book. Sergeant Steve Hanson was behind into the right of Lieutenant

441
00:46:08.96 --> 00:46:15.12
Tafft. He says, we moved at a trot across the open grass toward the tree line and heard fire up

442
00:46:15.12 --> 00:46:21.60
on the finger to the west where we were headed. My radio operator friend, specialist for

443
00:46:21.60 --> 00:46:28.16
Ray Turner, Ray Tanner, and I cross the streambed. Captain Nodal's party and the two other

444
00:46:28.16 --> 00:46:33.76
Patoons were off to the right. Lieutenant Tafft was well-forward as we crossed over into the trees.

445
00:46:33.76 --> 00:46:41.52
Sergeant first class Lorenzo Nathan Ray Turner and I were close maybe 10 yards behind.

446
00:46:42.08 --> 00:46:47.28
We were moving fast, specialist. Speck four, Pete Winter was near me.

447
00:46:48.80 --> 00:46:53.60
We ran into a wall of lead. Every man in the lead squad was shot.

448
00:46:54.48 --> 00:46:59.76
From the time we got the order to move to the time where men were dying was only five minutes.

449
00:46:59.76 --> 00:47:06.40
The enemy were very close to us and overran some of our dead. The firing was heavy.

450
00:47:06.96 --> 00:47:10.48
Sergeant Nathan pulled us back out of the woods of the streambed.

451
00:47:13.68 --> 00:47:19.12
Bob Hayes in Bob Tafft's radio operator recalls Lieutenant Tafft got out in front of me. I was off to his left.

452
00:47:19.68 --> 00:47:25.04
He had his radio handset in his left hand, connected to the radio on my back with that

453
00:47:25.04 --> 00:47:30.08
fluxed flexible rubber wire. It got tight and I pulled back on the lieutenant and hollered.

454
00:47:30.08 --> 00:47:36.16
We're getting off line. He glanced back at me, turned back to his front and took four more steps.

455
00:47:36.80 --> 00:47:41.84
Then he fired two shots at something I couldn't see what. Then he dropped face down on the ground.

456
00:47:42.56 --> 00:47:46.40
Lieutenant Tafft was hit. I didn't realize how bad until I rolled him over.

457
00:47:47.04 --> 00:47:51.20
He was shot in the throat and the rounded ricochet down and come out his left side.

458
00:47:51.20 --> 00:47:56.88
He was dead and it was difficult to roll him over. Even though he was a slightly built man.

459
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.20
Captain Nadal says the enemy on the mountain started moving down rapidly in somewhat

460
00:48:03.20 --> 00:48:09.12
uncoordinated attacks. They streamed down the hill and down the creek bed. The enemy knew the area.

461
00:48:09.76 --> 00:48:16.16
They came down the best cover route. The third platoon was heavily engaged in the volume of firing

462
00:48:16.16 --> 00:48:23.28
reached a crescendo on my left at this time I lost contact with Tafft platoon. In the center of

463
00:48:23.28 --> 00:48:30.000
that fury, Bob Hayes and struggled and rolled his dead platoon leader over. He was gone and there

464
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:36.08
was nothing we could do. The first thing I thought of was what they taught me. Never let the enemy

465
00:48:36.08 --> 00:48:41.28
get his hands on a map or the signals codebook. I got those from Lieutenant Tafft and was kneeling

466
00:48:41.28 --> 00:48:46.88
over to try and pull his body back. That's when my radio was hit and the shrapnel from the radio

467
00:48:46.88 --> 00:48:51.76
hit me in the back of the head. It didn't really hurt all the sun. I was just laying face down

468
00:48:51.76 --> 00:48:56.48
on the ground next to Lieutenant Tafft. I felt something running down my tree,

469
00:48:56.48 --> 00:49:03.44
my down my neck reached back and came out with a handful of blood. Carmen Miscelli was on Hayes

470
00:49:03.44 --> 00:49:11.20
and right. We knew what had happened. The word passed fast. They got Lieutenant Tafft. Again,

471
00:49:11.20 --> 00:49:16.40
we're talking within minutes of these guys arriving. This is going completely sideways.

472
00:49:19.68 --> 00:49:24.24
Back to the book, Captain Nadal out of radio contact with Tafft platoon moved toward the

473
00:49:24.24 --> 00:49:29.20
furious firing on his left flank to find out what was happening. Nadal says,

474
00:49:29.20 --> 00:49:35.76
my radio operator Sergeant Jack E. Gell, the company communications chief who had volunteered

475
00:49:35.76 --> 00:49:41.04
to carry one of my two radios ran with me out from out of the creek bed and into the open area

476
00:49:41.04 --> 00:49:46.000
toward Tafft's position. We ran into Sergeant Nathan and I asked him what was happening.

477
00:49:46.88 --> 00:49:51.04
He said the platoon had been attacked on the left flank. The left squad had taken a number of

478
00:49:51.04 --> 00:49:55.52
casualties and had pulled back out of the creek bed, refusing their left enemy, their left

479
00:49:55.52 --> 00:50:01.20
flank to the enemy. Nathan said Tafft had been hit and was left in the creek bed. That made

480
00:50:01.20 --> 00:50:07.12
me angry. We had been taught never to leave any wounded or dead on the battlefield. Sergeant Gell and I

481
00:50:07.12 --> 00:50:12.08
crawled forward of our lines to that creek bed where the enemy were to find Tafft. We came

482
00:50:12.08 --> 00:50:17.20
under grenade attack from the west side of the creek bed but had some cover from a few trees.

483
00:50:17.20 --> 00:50:22.56
We located Tafft dead. While bringing him back, we saw another soldier who had been left behind.

484
00:50:22.56 --> 00:50:27.68
After leaving Tafft's body with his platoon, Gell and I went back again and we picked up the other man.

485
00:50:36.56 --> 00:50:43.36
Back to the book, Dennis Deal remembers. We moved online for about a hundred or 150 yards

486
00:50:43.36 --> 00:50:49.12
before the volume of firing forced us to stop. We were taking too many casualties.

487
00:50:49.12 --> 00:50:54.64
I radioed Harix Platoon and said, I think we're getting close to you. Shoot one round off, wait

488
00:50:55.20 --> 00:51:00.48
to the count of three and shoot two more. The radio man or whoever was on the radio did that.

489
00:51:00.48 --> 00:51:05.68
So we had a pretty good fix on where he was. We got up and started the assault again. We went

490
00:51:05.68 --> 00:51:11.04
about 10 yards and the whole thing just blew in our faces. Blue up in our faces. The enemy

491
00:51:11.04 --> 00:51:17.44
had infiltrated between Harix Platoon and us and now we're starting to come behind us. So that

492
00:51:17.44 --> 00:51:23.04
Platoon that had gotten separated, this element with Dennis Deal was going out to try and get

493
00:51:23.04 --> 00:51:27.84
contact with them and bring them back inside the perimeter. They meet. They they they're assaulting.

494
00:51:27.84 --> 00:51:34.40
They go all hundred yards, 150 yards and they start getting mowed down. And now they realize that

495
00:51:34.40 --> 00:51:39.84
in between they've got bad guys in between where Harix Platoon is and where the rest of the

496
00:51:39.84 --> 00:51:44.32
perimeter is set up. Because they do have kind of a rough perimeter on this landing zone and the

497
00:51:44.32 --> 00:51:48.56
landing zone. Apologize for not explaining this. I mean in order to bring in Helicopters in the

498
00:51:48.56 --> 00:51:52.72
junk, we need some open space. So the landing zone, LZX, as an area where there's not much of

499
00:51:52.72 --> 00:51:57.84
foliage for whatever reason. And so that's where they've kind of consolidated their forces. Only

500
00:51:57.84 --> 00:52:01.44
because they can't go anywhere else. They hit the ground. They start getting shot at. So now they're

501
00:52:01.44 --> 00:52:07.60
setting up a what's called a perimeter. And obviously Harix Platoon is outside the perimeter.

502
00:52:07.60 --> 00:52:13.92
Back to the book. Lieutenant Deal adds that he and another he and the other two

503
00:52:13.92 --> 00:52:18.000
platoon leaders now began planning yet another attempt to break through and rescue Harix men.

504
00:52:18.80 --> 00:52:23.04
Leaders were running back and forth coordinating when all of a sudden firing began.

505
00:52:23.60 --> 00:52:28.80
The lull dissipated quickly. It was at this time my weapon squad leader Sergeant Curry,

506
00:52:28.80 --> 00:52:35.92
the chief was killed. His last words were those bastards are trying to get me. He was caught

507
00:52:35.92 --> 00:52:42.48
rolling around on the ground. Later on as my men were carrying him back, I had them put him down

508
00:52:42.48 --> 00:52:48.88
and turn his face toward me and looked at him. I could not conceive of the chief being dead.

509
00:52:50.48 --> 00:52:55.68
Staff Sergeant Wilbur Curry, Jr. of Buffalo, New York, was 35 years old.

510
00:52:55.68 --> 00:53:07.84
Haric and the other two squads were holding precariously to the small,

511
00:53:07.84 --> 00:53:16.80
no near the bottom of the finger. Savage, so a kid named Savage is out there with Harix Platoon.

512
00:53:16.80 --> 00:53:21.84
And he ends up running a lot of stuff and you'll find that out. But here he start here in a

513
00:53:21.84 --> 00:53:26.48
little bit of him right now. Savage teamed up with McKenry Squad, which was pinned to the ground.

514
00:53:26.48 --> 00:53:32.64
Haric was with that squad. Sergeant Zaylan Squad was off to the left rear. Savage checked on his

515
00:53:32.64 --> 00:53:41.04
men when he tied up with McKenry. He knew that spec 4 Robert M. Hill M79 Grenadier was no longer

516
00:53:41.04 --> 00:53:48.24
with them. He got killed in there somewhere. He had his M79 and a 45 caliber pistol and he was firing

517
00:53:48.24 --> 00:53:54.32
both at the same time. The 23-year-old Hill came from Starkville, Mississippi.

518
00:53:56.24 --> 00:54:01.12
And here's Sergeant Savage talking, explaining some more, back to the book. The enemy was

519
00:54:01.12 --> 00:54:06.08
past the machine gun before it ever quit firing. I could hear Sergeant Hurdle down there cursing,

520
00:54:06.08 --> 00:54:11.52
even over the firefight I heard him. He was famous for that. Motherfucker, son of a bitch,

521
00:54:11.52 --> 00:54:16.88
I could hear him hollering that down there when they threw, then they threw grenades on him.

522
00:54:16.88 --> 00:54:23.76
Hurdle 36 was from Washington, DC. Baron bomb 24 was a native of New York City.

523
00:54:24.48 --> 00:54:31.84
PFC Donald Roddy 22 hailed from Ann Arbor, Michigan. The three of them died in a hail

524
00:54:32.40 --> 00:54:42.80
of rifle fire and enemy grenades. The enemy down below turns Sergeant Hurdle's M60 around and

525
00:54:42.80 --> 00:54:49.04
begin using it on the Americans on the knowle. So that causes all kinds of confusion.

526
00:54:49.76 --> 00:54:54.56
You can tell the difference between different types of weapons by the way they sound when they shoot

527
00:54:54.56 --> 00:55:00.56
and when someone starts shooting a friendly weapon at you, it's caused a lot of confusion and the M60

528
00:55:00.56 --> 00:55:07.92
is a beast of a weapon. Belt fed machine gun and it's when I got in the seal teams that was the

529
00:55:07.92 --> 00:55:14.72
machine gun that we used was the M60 machine gun and it's a devastating weapon. Back to the book,

530
00:55:14.72 --> 00:55:20.72
the enemy more than 150 strong now attacked the knowle from three sides, north, south and east.

531
00:55:21.76 --> 00:55:26.96
And soldiers on both sides were falling. Lieutenant Haric ran from Trooper to Trooper trying to get

532
00:55:26.96 --> 00:55:32.16
a defense organized and enemy volley cut across Haric, his radio operator specialist,

533
00:55:32.16 --> 00:55:41.52
John R. Stewart and the artillery recon sergeant, sergeant, John T. Brown wounding all three.

534
00:55:42.24 --> 00:55:47.76
Haric and Brown seriously. Stewart took a single bullet through the leg. Haric radioed

535
00:55:47.76 --> 00:55:51.76
Bravo Company commander John Harin and told him he had been hit and he was turning command

536
00:55:51.76 --> 00:55:57.52
of the platoon over to sergeant Carl Palmer. Haric then gave explicit instructions to his men to

537
00:55:57.52 --> 00:56:02.80
destroy the singles codes, redistribute the ammunition and call an artillery and if possible,

538
00:56:02.80 --> 00:56:08.64
make a break for it. Harin says, I give Haric all the credit in the world for pulling that

539
00:56:08.64 --> 00:56:16.08
platoon together so they could make their stand. So should we all? Savage and Zalin

540
00:56:16.08 --> 00:56:21.44
paint a clear picture of a green, young lieutenant who did a superb job in a hail storm of

541
00:56:21.44 --> 00:56:27.68
enemy fire. His platoon stopped the very large north Vietnamese unit clearly heading down to

542
00:56:27.68 --> 00:56:33.04
join the attack on the landing zone. I long ago concluded that the very presence of this platoon

543
00:56:33.04 --> 00:56:38.08
so far to the northwest confused the enemy commander as to exactly where we were and how far we

544
00:56:38.08 --> 00:56:46.08
had penetrated in all directions and thus helped us as the battle built. Sergeant Savage recounts

545
00:56:46.08 --> 00:56:50.88
the final moments of Henry Haric's life. He was lying beside me on the hill and he said,

546
00:56:50.88 --> 00:56:56.08
if I have to die, I'm glad to give my life for my country. I remember him saying that

547
00:56:56.72 --> 00:57:03.12
he was going into shock, hidden the hip and in a lot of pain. He didn't live long. He died early

548
00:57:03.12 --> 00:57:12.000
in the fight next to a little brush pile. Spectre four Charles R. Lowe's 22 of Mobile Ammo,

549
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Alabama was the new platoon medic. He joined the platoon only a few days earlier. Lieutenant Haric

550
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:24.40
was kneeling when hit. He had a bullet wound to the hip. He told me to go help the other wounded.

551
00:57:28.72 --> 00:57:37.28
Yeah, we have to remember that this guy Haric is like 22, 23-year-old fresh out of

552
00:57:37.28 --> 00:57:48.40
him. He made that majorly offensive move and pursued and got out of touch. But how more is saying,

553
00:57:48.40 --> 00:57:51.60
hey, that confused the enemy. Even though it confused the friendly suit, it confused the enemy

554
00:57:51.60 --> 00:58:00.40
as well. So there's some good that came out of it. Back to the book, Sergeant Ruben Thomas was

555
00:58:00.40 --> 00:58:04.96
struck by a bullet above his heart that exited under his left arm, bleeding heavily. He grabbed

556
00:58:04.96 --> 00:58:10.80
a rifle and fought on. The encircled infantrymen of the lost platoon refused to give up.

557
00:58:12.16 --> 00:58:17.44
Here's what Specialist Dorman said. We were all on the ground now and if you moved, you got hit.

558
00:58:18.40 --> 00:58:23.12
Our training really showed then we shifted into defense of positions. We had five men killed

559
00:58:23.12 --> 00:58:27.68
in 25 minutes. Then all of a sudden they tried to mass assault from three directions rushing

560
00:58:27.68 --> 00:58:36.40
from Bush to Bush laying fire on us. We put our M-16s on full automatic and killed most of them.

561
00:58:36.40 --> 00:58:43.12
Another guy named Galen, Bung, Bung, Bung, Bungum said, we gathered up all the full magazines.

562
00:58:43.12 --> 00:58:47.68
We could find and stack them up in front of us. There was no way we could dig a foxhole. The handle

563
00:58:47.68 --> 00:58:52.000
was blown off my entrenching tool and one of my canteen said, I'll hold blown through it.

564
00:58:52.64 --> 00:58:56.000
The fire was so heavy that if you tried to raise up to dig you were dead,

565
00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:03.28
there was death and destruction all around. By now, eight men of the platoon's 29 have been killed

566
00:59:03.28 --> 00:59:10.24
in action. Another 13 were wounded. The 25 yard wide perimeter was a circle of pain, death,

567
00:59:10.24 --> 00:59:18.24
fear and raw courage. Medic Charlie Lowe's crawled from men to men throughout the raging firefight

568
00:59:18.24 --> 00:59:24.08
doing his best to patch the wounded with limited supplies and his medical pack. Although he himself

569
00:59:24.08 --> 00:59:31.44
was wounded twice, Lowe's never slowed his pace. He would keep all 13 of the wounded alive for the

570
00:59:31.44 --> 00:59:39.68
for 26 long, harrowing hours. Lowe says, on several occasions, I had to stand or sit up to treat

571
00:59:39.68 --> 00:59:48.24
the wounded. Each time the VC fired heavily at me. Lowe's used his 45 and M-16 rifle to help

572
00:59:48.24 --> 00:59:59.12
defend his patients. Getting attacked from three sides, 13 wounded, eight dead, was it nine dead?

573
01:00:04.40 --> 01:00:10.08
Unbelievable. Back to the book, command had passed. So this is talking about,

574
01:00:11.44 --> 01:00:15.68
if the leader gets killed, it goes to the next person, that person gets killed, it goes to the next

575
01:00:15.68 --> 01:00:21.60
person. So here's what's happening in harrowing spatoon, the lost platoon. Back to the book, command

576
01:00:21.60 --> 01:00:26.96
had passed from Lieutenant Henry Harric to Sergeant Carl Palmer to Sergeant Robert Stokes and each

577
01:00:26.96 --> 01:00:33.76
in turn died fighting. Now it was the turn of Buck Sergeant Ernie Savage. Sergeant Savage came

578
01:00:33.76 --> 01:00:39.92
up on the radio, Captain Harrow calls. He said, Harrowing sparring, Stokes were dead to give him

579
01:00:39.92 --> 01:00:45.04
more artillery and he would direct it in as close as possible. We could never establish the platoon's

580
01:00:45.04 --> 01:00:51.04
exact position. But Lieutenant Riddle could have just fire on Savage's sensing and he began to do that.

581
01:00:53.84 --> 01:00:58.96
The extraordinary unyielding resistance that the dozen or so effective fighter fighters were

582
01:00:58.96 --> 01:01:04.40
putting up plus the artillery barrages that Ernie Savage was bringing down, finally beat off the

583
01:01:04.40 --> 01:01:11.68
heavy enemy attack. Ernie Savage and his small band honkered down determined to hold their ground

584
01:01:11.68 --> 01:01:17.84
to the end. Yeah, these guys are calling in to danger. Of course, if we were talking about danger

585
01:01:17.84 --> 01:01:25.76
close, no, no. Okay, danger close is when you're calling in fire support and you want it to be

586
01:01:25.76 --> 01:01:30.72
very close to where you are and you on the ground have to take responsibility for it. So in

587
01:01:30.72 --> 01:01:35.60
other words, the person whether it's artillery, whether it's aircraft, you have to call in, say,

588
01:01:35.60 --> 01:01:41.44
danger close. Yes, send the rounds. We know it's close. It's we take responsibility for what happens.

589
01:01:44.16 --> 01:01:49.92
And by the way, going back to the book as this fifth left lift of the day roared out at

590
01:01:49.92 --> 01:01:53.12
treetop level, the landing zone was suddenly turned red hot. So they haven't even landed

591
01:01:53.12 --> 01:01:56.24
everyone yet. But this is going on. They haven't even gotten everyone on the landing zone yet.

592
01:01:56.24 --> 01:02:05.68
Yeah. And here's Krandell talking and again, he's the pilot, unbelievably heroic pilot and

593
01:02:05.68 --> 01:02:11.04
commanding officer of this helicopter unit. Says Krandell, as I was flaring out to touch down,

594
01:02:11.04 --> 01:02:16.96
we started receiving heavy, heavy ground fire. I had three dead and three wounded on my board,

595
01:02:16.96 --> 01:02:22.08
bird. The wounded included my crew chief who had been hit in the throat. When we landed, we saw

596
01:02:22.08 --> 01:02:28.24
that every bullet had struck the wounded in the head or neck, excellent markmanship by the other side

597
01:02:28.24 --> 01:02:34.72
and not a happy thought for a helicopter pilot to say the least. So the enemies taken headshots.

598
01:02:36.48 --> 01:02:42.72
Back to the book with Krandell, flying serpent yellow three were chief war officers,

599
01:02:42.72 --> 01:02:50.88
Ricardo J. Lambardo 34 of Hartford, Connecticut and Alex S. Pop, jekyll 43 of Seattle, Washington.

600
01:02:50.88 --> 01:02:55.76
Pop jekyll was a father of nine children during World War II at the age of 20. He had flown

601
01:02:55.76 --> 01:03:01.20
beat 24s out of England and beat 29s during the post were years until he left the service in

602
01:03:01.20 --> 01:03:07.52
1950. Pop jekyll reinlisted in 1952 and had been flying helicopters since 1963.

603
01:03:08.72 --> 01:03:15.20
Pop jekyll keyed the inner comm and said, I flew 31 missions in B-24s in World War II. And that's

604
01:03:15.20 --> 01:03:23.28
the closest I've ever come to swallowing my balls. So these landing zones were crazy with these helicopter

605
01:03:23.28 --> 01:03:30.16
pilots flying in there. It's your gear. You're getting there as fast as you can, but there's

606
01:03:30.16 --> 01:03:34.40
not much you can do. You bring it in as fast as you can. You try and get loaded up quick and you try and

607
01:03:34.40 --> 01:03:38.32
take off, but it's not like you're able to shoot back. Even once you're on the ground, your machine

608
01:03:38.32 --> 01:03:41.12
gunners in the hewies, they can't shoot anymore because you don't know where the friendly troops are.

609
01:03:41.12 --> 01:03:47.76
So you're a sitting duck, literally a sitting duck. And these pilots going in time and time and

610
01:03:47.76 --> 01:03:55.20
time again. This goes to the Delta Company commander La Febra. And here's what's going on.

611
01:03:55.92 --> 01:04:02.48
La Febra, seriously wounded was phasing, was fading fast. I lost a lot of blood. I could see

612
01:04:02.48 --> 01:04:07.04
people shooting, but I couldn't hear any sounds anymore. I told John here and somebody had to take

613
01:04:07.04 --> 01:04:11.76
over. I called again Colonel Moore and told him that I was going to turn over the company to

614
01:04:11.76 --> 01:04:18.32
sergeant Gonzalez. Then the medic arrived to bendage my wound shortly after. I remember someone

615
01:04:18.32 --> 01:04:22.88
putting me in a poncho and hauling me over to the area of the battalion command post. When I saw

616
01:04:22.88 --> 01:04:28.88
Lieutenant Aboda again, later we never did talk much about it. It was just too damn close to the real

617
01:04:28.88 --> 01:04:36.16
thing. Ray La Febra and his handful of Delta Company troopers had unknowingly joined the

618
01:04:36.16 --> 01:04:41.52
Alpha Company flight at a crucial moment. About 30 North Vietnamese were flanking the dolls men on their

619
01:04:41.52 --> 01:04:46.96
left and Captain La Febra La Febra's party ran smack into them and killed most of them.

620
01:04:47.68 --> 01:04:54.16
The dolls men dispatched the rest. Unknown to La Febra, sergeant Gonzalez had been hit in the face by

621
01:04:54.16 --> 01:04:59.92
an enemy bullet. Gonzalez simply said Roger, when La Febra told him he was now in command. And

622
01:04:59.92 --> 01:05:10.40
for the next hour and a half he ran Delta Company. Sergeant Gonzalez shot in the face, no factor.

623
01:05:10.40 --> 01:05:20.32
I'm going to take leadership right now. Going back to the book, it was during all this

624
01:05:20.32 --> 01:05:25.44
horror that Beck remembers fear coming over him. And here's Beck talking. While Doc Knall was here

625
01:05:25.44 --> 01:05:31.20
with me working on Russell, fear, real fear hit me. Fear like I had never known before.

626
01:05:31.20 --> 01:05:35.68
Fear comes and once you recognize it and accept that it passes just as fast as it comes and

627
01:05:35.68 --> 01:05:40.88
you really don't have to think about it anymore. You just do what you have to do, but you learn

628
01:05:40.88 --> 01:05:47.76
the real meaning of fear and life and death. For the next two hours I was alone on that gun

629
01:05:47.76 --> 01:05:51.92
shooting the enemy. Any minute we're shooting at me and bullets were hitting the ground beside

630
01:05:51.92 --> 01:05:56.48
me and cracking above my head. They were attacking me and I fired as fast as I could in long bursts.

631
01:05:57.44 --> 01:06:03.28
My M60 was cooking. I had to take a crap and a leak bad so I pulled my pants down while laying

632
01:06:03.28 --> 01:06:10.48
on my side and did it on my side, taking fire at the time. Now we're going back to how more talking

633
01:06:10.48 --> 01:06:16.88
here. From my command post at the termite hill, the enemy were clearly visible 100 yards to the

634
01:06:16.88 --> 01:06:23.36
south. They were damned good soldiers. Used covered concealment to perfection and were deadly shots.

635
01:06:23.36 --> 01:06:28.24
Most of my dead and wounded soldiers have been shot in the head or upper body. The North Vietnamese

636
01:06:28.24 --> 01:06:32.64
paid particular attention to radio operators and leaders. They did not appear to have radio

637
01:06:32.64 --> 01:06:39.68
as themselves. They controlled their men by shouts, waves, pointing, whistles and sometimes bugle calls.

638
01:06:39.68 --> 01:06:47.04
It was 245 p.m. All three of my rifle companies were heavily engaged. We had lost the use

639
01:06:47.04 --> 01:06:52.08
of the larger clearing for the helicopter landings. Wounded were streaming into the command post

640
01:06:52.08 --> 01:06:56.72
aid station. We were in a desperate fix and I was worried that it could become even more desperate.

641
01:06:57.68 --> 01:07:02.56
By now I believe we were fighting at least two people's armies battalions turns out it was

642
01:07:02.56 --> 01:07:07.28
three. They were very determined to wipe us out but a major difference between lieutenant colon

643
01:07:07.28 --> 01:07:13.12
when who on of the people's army of Vietnam and lieutenant Colonel Howmore of the first cavalry

644
01:07:13.12 --> 01:07:19.60
division was that I had major fire support and he didn't air force captain Bruce Wallace

645
01:07:19.60 --> 01:07:25.92
and his fellow A1E Skyrader pilots as well as the jet fighter bombers from all three services

646
01:07:25.92 --> 01:07:30.80
help provide that edge. Flying 50 sordys and close air support that Sunday afternoon.

647
01:07:30.80 --> 01:07:37.36
He says Wallace the importance of airplanes and a vulgar brawl is to be down among the palm trees

648
01:07:37.36 --> 01:07:41.68
with the troops putting ordinance on the ground at the exact time in the precise place that the

649
01:07:41.68 --> 01:07:50.24
ground command needs it. And then so they're in these old school skyraders but then captain

650
01:07:50.24 --> 01:07:56.08
Wallace is talking about what it was like watching the helicopters back to the book with it. It

651
01:07:56.08 --> 01:08:01.44
was different with a Huey to watch four eight of them at a time maneuvering up and down and

652
01:08:01.44 --> 01:08:08.08
laterally and even backwards boggles the fighter pilots mind. Those guys swarmed a target like

653
01:08:08.08 --> 01:08:13.36
bees over honey. I had to hand it to those Huey guys. They really got down there in the trees with the

654
01:08:13.36 --> 01:08:20.88
troops. Then this is how Maher howmore talking again the field artillery what we called

655
01:08:20.88 --> 01:08:25.12
two bartillery to distinguish how it's your folks from the helicopter rocket folks proudly

656
01:08:25.12 --> 01:08:31.28
calls itself the king of battle. The brave cannon cockers in Elzee falcon went without sleep for

657
01:08:31.28 --> 01:08:37.76
three days and three nights to help keep us surrounded by a wall of steel. Those two batteries,

658
01:08:37.76 --> 01:08:43.60
12 guns fired more than 4,000 rounds of high explosive shells on the first day alone.

659
01:08:45.60 --> 01:08:50.88
Says Barker on the first afternoon both batteries fired for effect directly on target for

660
01:08:50.88 --> 01:08:57.68
five straight hours. One of Bruce Krandels Huey's slick pilots captain Paul Winkle touched down at

661
01:08:57.68 --> 01:09:02.96
Falcon briefly that at first afternoon and was astounded by what he saw. There were stacks of shell

662
01:09:02.96 --> 01:09:08.96
casings at least 10 feet high and exhausted gun crews. They had fired for effect for three state

663
01:09:08.96 --> 01:09:15.04
straight hours by then without even pausing to level the bubbles. One tube was burned out to

664
01:09:15.04 --> 01:09:21.28
be busted hydraulics. That's some shooting. No matter how bad things got for Americans fighting

665
01:09:21.28 --> 01:09:26.88
for their lives on the x-ray perimeter we could look out to the scrub brush in every direction

666
01:09:26.88 --> 01:09:32.72
into that seething inferno of exploding artillery shells 2.75 inch rockets,

667
01:09:32.72 --> 01:09:39.12
napalm canisters 250 in 500 pound bombs and 20 millimeter cannon fire and thank God

668
01:09:39.12 --> 01:09:43.20
and our lucky stars that we didn't have to walk through that to get to work.

669
01:09:46.56 --> 01:09:52.48
Yeah, so like I said the the close air support is absolutely or the close air support the

670
01:09:52.48 --> 01:10:01.12
artillery is absolutely what and that's been happened many on many occasions for for American soldiers,

671
01:10:01.12 --> 01:10:08.000
sailors, marines, overseas fighting, you know the air force, the navy pilots, the marine

672
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.92
core fire pilots coming in and actually the guy on the ground controlling these guys is a

673
01:10:11.92 --> 01:10:18.16
air force pilot as well. So having that air superiority is a wonderful thing.

674
01:10:20.64 --> 01:10:25.52
Now speaking of the avianers going back to the helicopters chapter nine in this book is called

675
01:10:25.52 --> 01:10:32.08
brave avianers and it again is sitting ducks coming in as crazy to read about.

676
01:10:33.12 --> 01:10:36.80
Going back to the book over the 20 months of air mobile training a bond had been welled

677
01:10:36.80 --> 01:10:40.64
between the infantry and their rides that Huey helicopter pilots and crewmen.

678
01:10:41.28 --> 01:10:46.64
Now the strength of that bond would be tested in the hottest of fires. If the air bridge failed,

679
01:10:46.64 --> 01:10:51.04
so the the meaning of the helicopter's ability to get there if the air bridge failed,

680
01:10:51.04 --> 01:10:56.48
the embattled men of first battalion seventh calf would certainly die in much the same way

681
01:10:56.48 --> 01:11:02.56
George Armstrong Custard's cavalry men died at Little Big Horn. Cut off surrounded by numerically

682
01:11:02.56 --> 01:11:09.28
superior forces overrun and butchered to the last man. I asked Bruce Kent, Krandels,

683
01:11:09.76 --> 01:11:15.84
brave air crews of Alpha Company, the 229th Aviation Battalion for the last measure of

684
01:11:15.84 --> 01:11:22.56
devotion for service far beyond the limits of duty and mission and they came through as I knew they would.

685
01:11:24.24 --> 01:11:29.84
And so so again you're basically asking these guys to get shot down every time they fly in and

686
01:11:29.84 --> 01:11:34.80
this is interesting. Back to the book, this was early in the war and the Metavac commanders had

687
01:11:34.80 --> 01:11:40.40
decreed that their birds would not land in hot landing zones. In other words, that they would not

688
01:11:40.40 --> 01:11:46.88
go where they would need it when they were needed the most. Even before I asked Bruce Krandel

689
01:11:46.88 --> 01:11:50.24
at Art Decided to begin doing everything that had to be done.

690
01:11:50.24 --> 01:11:59.68
Staying with it, Krandel now dropped as Huey loaded with casualties onto the red dirt strip.

691
01:11:59.68 --> 01:12:05.76
And this is Krandel talking. When we hit the ground, we were met by medics and infantry troops

692
01:12:05.76 --> 01:12:11.44
still waiting to be lifted into X-ray. So that's another crazy thing to think about. You're

693
01:12:11.44 --> 01:12:16.64
unloading wounded men and you're getting on that aircraft that's going to go pick up more

694
01:12:16.64 --> 01:12:20.32
wounded men but you're going to stay. So the troops that aren't on the ground yet think about what's

695
01:12:20.32 --> 01:12:26.64
going through their minds. They remove the dead and you want to know what's going through their minds?

696
01:12:26.64 --> 01:12:29.76
I actually know what's going through their minds. They're going most of those guys are saying,

697
01:12:29.76 --> 01:12:33.60
get me in there as fast as you can. That's what they're saying. These are their brothers out there.

698
01:12:37.36 --> 01:12:41.92
Back to the book, they removed the dead and wounded from my bird and this act is engraved in my

699
01:12:41.92 --> 01:12:47.52
mind deeper than any other experience in my two tours in Vietnam. A huge black and listed man,

700
01:12:47.52 --> 01:12:52.32
clad only in shorts and boots, hands bigger than dinner plates reaching to my helicopter to pick up

701
01:12:52.32 --> 01:12:58.56
one of the dead white soldiers. He had tears streaming down his face and he tenderly created

702
01:12:58.56 --> 01:13:03.84
cradle that dead soldier to his chest as he walked slowly from the aircraft to the medical station.

703
01:13:04.72 --> 01:13:11.28
I never knew if the man he picked up was his buddy or not. I suspect not. His grief was for a

704
01:13:11.28 --> 01:13:16.40
fallen comrades and for the agony that violent death brings to those who witnessed it.

705
01:13:22.40 --> 01:13:28.000
More about the helicopters back to the book, one of the ships brought in Larry Litton,

706
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.84
who immediately took over command of Delta Company from the wounded sergeant Gonzalez. I told him

707
01:13:33.84 --> 01:13:40.16
to add the four Delta mortars to consolidate mortar position set up by Captain Edwards and to control

708
01:13:40.16 --> 01:13:45.36
all seven mortars from a single fire direction center. Principal direction of fire was towards

709
01:13:45.36 --> 01:13:50.000
Alphan Bravo companies and the mortar man would also have the mission of defending our two

710
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.96
chopper landing zones from the east. There is no highlight that is even though I talk about

711
01:13:54.96 --> 01:13:59.36
decentralized command all the time and how more starts off the book talking about how important

712
01:13:59.36 --> 01:14:05.20
decentralized command is. He's right now in that moment he's centralizing command. He needs to

713
01:14:05.20 --> 01:14:10.24
get control of all the mortars so that they can use it correctly. Again, that's why it's the

714
01:14:10.24 --> 01:14:15.04
dichotomy of leadership because you can, there's times when you most of the time you

715
01:14:15.04 --> 01:14:18.16
decentralized but you can actually decentralize too much. If you don't coordinate the efforts of

716
01:14:18.16 --> 01:14:21.84
these mortars, you're not going to use them effectively. So he centralizes the command of the

717
01:14:21.84 --> 01:14:26.000
mortars, brings them all into one location and starts using them effectively. So that's a good note

718
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:34.80
for leaders to remember. Now here's another platoon commander, Joe Morm.

719
01:14:34.80 --> 01:14:40.88
Joe Morm describes the situation in his platoon. My platoon medic was a short timer and did not

720
01:14:40.88 --> 01:14:47.52
accompany us to Chu Pong. Sergeant first class George McCulley, the platoon sergeant,

721
01:14:47.52 --> 01:14:53.60
carried the aid kit and we planned to use staff sergeant Thomas Toliver as our medic

722
01:14:53.60 --> 01:14:58.72
when the need arose. He had been a combat medic during the Korean War and was well qualified.

723
01:14:58.72 --> 01:15:05.20
Still, we did not have enough medics to go around so we sent down specialist booknight and

724
01:15:05.20 --> 01:15:10.72
specialist Charles Lowe's a senior medical aid man as platoon medics to Bravo Company.

725
01:15:11.84 --> 01:15:18.24
Now Calvin booknight still alive but mortally wounded was laid gently on the ground in his blood-filled

726
01:15:18.24 --> 01:15:24.72
rubber poncho before the medical platoon sergeant. Sergeant first class Keaton, his friend and

727
01:15:24.72 --> 01:15:31.36
Comrade for the last two years and here's what Keaton says. Booknight wasn't dead. He was shot right

728
01:15:31.36 --> 01:15:37.76
between the soldiers, right directly between the soldiers. He reached up and took my hand and said,

729
01:15:37.76 --> 01:15:44.80
serge, I didn't make it. We got an IV started on him and put a pressure bandage over his back wound.

730
01:15:45.84 --> 01:15:50.96
There was just no hope. We were able to get him on an evac ship but he died.

731
01:15:50.96 --> 01:15:57.20
The scriptures say that there is no greater love than to lay down your life for your friends.

732
01:15:58.72 --> 01:16:05.04
This is what Calvin Booknight did in that fire-filled jungle. He sheltered the wounded

733
01:16:05.04 --> 01:16:24.16
he was treating with his own body, his back to the enemy guns completely vulnerable.

734
01:16:24.16 --> 01:16:34.80
And except for the predicament of sergeant savage and the cutoff platoon, I was feeling a good deal better about the situation. We had all of our men in.

735
01:16:34.80 --> 01:16:40.48
Massive firepower had been deployed. A company reinforcements was on the way. Our two chopper lifeline landing

736
01:16:40.48 --> 01:16:46.72
Zelean was secure. Most of our wounded were either evacuated or awaiting evacuation and we were holding tough.

737
01:16:46.72 --> 01:16:53.04
I was determined to make one more attempt to rescue sergeant savage and all of us wounded and dead on the slope.

738
01:16:54.16 --> 01:17:00.08
I ordered Alphan Bravo companies to evacuate their casualties with draw out of close contact with the enemy

739
01:17:00.08 --> 01:17:04.72
under covering fires and prepared a launch, a coordinated attack supported by heavy prepared to where

740
01:17:04.72 --> 01:17:12.96
artillery fire to reach the cutoff platoon. I was tortured by the fate of those men and the need to rescue them.

741
01:17:12.96 --> 01:17:22.08
And chapter 10 is called Fix Bay Annets, which can give you an indication. Back to the book,

742
01:17:22.08 --> 01:17:27.76
Alphan Bravo companies, the first units to land had now been locked in violent battle for more than two hours.

743
01:17:27.76 --> 01:17:32.16
It had suffered no small number of casualties, especially among the sergeants and radio operators.

744
01:17:32.16 --> 01:17:36.32
And it shawed up most of their ammunition. That's another thing we got to remember.

745
01:17:37.04 --> 01:17:41.68
The movies they never run out of ammunition, right? Unless it makes some theatrical point.

746
01:17:41.68 --> 01:17:46.64
Yeah, plot point. Right. They also in the movies, there's plenty of water. Oh, they're in the jungle.

747
01:17:46.64 --> 01:17:48.56
They got plenty of water. These guys don't have water out here.

748
01:17:51.84 --> 01:17:55.60
No water, no food and now they're running out of ammunition. The two commanders,

749
01:17:56.56 --> 01:18:01.52
Tony Nadal and John Hare needed time to evacuate their dead and wounded to reorganize and regroup their

750
01:18:01.52 --> 01:18:07.60
diminished platoons and designate new leaders and to replenish stocks of ammunition and grenades.

751
01:18:07.60 --> 01:18:13.36
They would have 40 minutes to accomplish this. Then heavy artillery fire would laying down a head of them

752
01:18:13.36 --> 01:18:19.44
as they kicked off one more attempt to break through the ring of enemy troops and rescue the survivors of Lieutenant Henry

753
01:18:19.44 --> 01:18:23.76
Herrick's Secondal Tune. Meanwhile, help was on the way.

754
01:18:24.48 --> 01:18:28.40
Back at third brigade headquarters in the tea plantation, the orders were going out.

755
01:18:28.40 --> 01:18:33.20
Our sister Battalion, the second Battalion, seventh Cavalism formed that one of its companies Bravo

756
01:18:33.20 --> 01:18:40.16
was being detached and sent to landing X-ray, landing zone X-ray to reinforce. On arrival in X-ray,

757
01:18:40.16 --> 01:18:44.80
Bravo Company Second Battalion would come under my operational control for the duration of the fight.

758
01:18:44.80 --> 01:18:49.60
So there's two battalions. Each Battalion has a number of companies in them and they're going to

759
01:18:49.60 --> 01:18:56.88
take one of the companies from the other Battalion and let them come in as reinforcements.

760
01:18:56.88 --> 01:19:05.68
Captain Mairen, Dedurich, Bravo Company, troops won the toss hand down.

761
01:19:05.68 --> 01:19:12.72
So there was a bunch of different companies there and they were all doing various things.

762
01:19:12.72 --> 01:19:19.04
But Mairen Dedurich's company was actually, I think they were standing guard and they were

763
01:19:19.04 --> 01:19:24.08
closest by and so they were the ones that were going and it's probably a good thing because

764
01:19:24.08 --> 01:19:29.28
this guy, Captain Dedurich is a complete badass as we'll see.

765
01:19:30.48 --> 01:19:34.24
Bravo Company Second Battalion had good solid professional non-combs and its troops

766
01:19:34.24 --> 01:19:38.56
served together for some for a long time. It was a good rifle company, I was happy to get it.

767
01:19:38.56 --> 01:19:43.68
Captain Dedurich was 27 years old, a native born Ukrainian who'd come to the United States with

768
01:19:43.68 --> 01:19:50.32
his family in 1950. He was an ROTC graduate from St. Peter's College in Jersey City, New Jersey,

769
01:19:50.32 --> 01:19:56.16
and was commissioned in July of 1960. He completed Paratrooper in Ranger Training and had served

770
01:19:56.16 --> 01:20:01.76
tours in Germany and at Fort Pending. Dedurich was married and the father of two children.

771
01:20:03.92 --> 01:20:08.32
While our reinforcements were saddling up, my Alphan Bravo companies were about to launch

772
01:20:08.32 --> 01:20:13.52
their second attempt to break through Lieutenant Herrick's trap platoon. John Herron and Tony Nadal

773
01:20:13.52 --> 01:20:17.68
had pulled their men back to the dry creek bed during the law so they would begin the attack

774
01:20:17.68 --> 01:20:23.12
from there. Platoon Sergeant Troy Miller remembers the scene. Our morale was very high after the

775
01:20:23.12 --> 01:20:28.48
first contact before we went off. Before we went after the cutoff platoon, Captain DeDal got us together

776
01:20:28.48 --> 01:20:32.08
and said, man, we've got an American platoon cutoff out there and we're going after them.

777
01:20:32.64 --> 01:20:38.000
Their applies were, yeah, and let's go get them and Gary Owen and Gary Owen is the

778
01:20:39.20 --> 01:20:46.32
it's like the war cry of the cavalry. So and there's a comes from an old song and it's just a

779
01:20:46.32 --> 01:20:50.24
historical thing and that's why you read the book. You can find out about Gary Owen.

780
01:20:51.92 --> 01:20:59.92
It's their marching song. Back to the book, Captain Tony Nadal, Alphan Company, was the first

781
01:20:59.92 --> 01:21:04.88
man out of the creek bed leading first platoon in the assault. He recalls, we moved about 50 yards

782
01:21:04.88 --> 01:21:09.20
when we ran into the enemy force which had come down the mountain. I presume they were

783
01:21:09.20 --> 01:21:13.44
preparing to launch their attack about the time we launched ours. The fighting quickly became

784
01:21:13.44 --> 01:21:20.08
very vicious at close range. We took many casualties. Lieutenant Wayne Johnson, the first platoon

785
01:21:20.08 --> 01:21:24.96
leader was hit. At least three other squad leaders were also hit. Two of them killed.

786
01:21:25.68 --> 01:21:30.48
One while going forward in an attempt to rescue one of his soldiers against direct orders.

787
01:21:30.48 --> 01:21:40.08
Against direct orders, I'm going out to get my buddy.

788
01:21:46.56 --> 01:21:49.92
Tony Nadal had ordered his men to fix bayonets for the attack.

789
01:21:51.36 --> 01:21:56.64
Bill Beck firing a burst from his M60 machine gun to his right front was transfixed by

790
01:21:56.64 --> 01:22:02.24
what he saw just forward. A tall thin sergeant bayonetting of North Vietnamese in the chest.

791
01:22:03.20 --> 01:22:10.16
It was just like practice against the straw dummies. Forward thrust pull out move on. One, two,

792
01:22:10.16 --> 01:22:14.88
three. Captain Tony Nadal had four men in his command group as he charged into the brush.

793
01:22:14.88 --> 01:22:20.80
Two radio operators, sergeant Jack Gal in a 25-year-old native New Yorker and specialist.

794
01:22:20.80 --> 01:22:27.12
Spect Ford John Clark of Michigan plus the company's artillery forwarded observer lieutenant Timothy M. Blake

795
01:22:27.12 --> 01:22:34.56
24 from Charleston, West Virginia and Blake's recon sergeant, sergeant Floyd L. Reed, Jr. 27 years

796
01:22:34.56 --> 01:22:41.76
old of half Arkansas. As they moved up, Nadal had the radio handset to his ear.

797
01:22:42.48 --> 01:22:46.88
A burst of any machine gun fire swept across the group. Sergeant Gal was hit and dropped

798
01:22:46.88 --> 01:22:56.24
without a sound. Nadal kept moving until the long black cord pulled back on him. He was looking

799
01:22:56.24 --> 01:23:00.16
around to see what was wrong. The same burst that killed Sergeant Gal and also killed Lieutenant

800
01:23:00.16 --> 01:23:07.76
Blake and struck Sergeant Reed who died shortly thereafter. Sergeant Sam Holman, native

801
01:23:08.80 --> 01:23:15.20
Sergeant Sam Holman, Jr. a native of Pennsylvania, Naut beside his mortally wounded buddy Jack Gal

802
01:23:15.20 --> 01:23:30.16
and heard him gasp. Tell my wife I love her. Tony Nadal had no time to mourn Jack Gal.

803
01:23:30.16 --> 01:23:37.52
A man he greatly respected. Too many other lives were in his hands. On the right flank

804
01:23:39.36 --> 01:23:43.60
of the Bravo line, Lieutenant Deal was now rolling around on the ground desperately trying to

805
01:23:43.60 --> 01:23:47.20
dodge a valley of machine gun slugs cutting through the grass all around him.

806
01:23:48.48 --> 01:23:53.28
Suddenly 25 yards away, Deal saw an American get up and charge forward while everyone around him was

807
01:23:53.28 --> 01:23:59.68
flat on his belly. Says Deal, I saw him throw a grenade behind a net, hell, an MP is weapon into it.

808
01:23:59.68 --> 01:24:04.64
Then he fell to his knees. I said to myself, please get up. Don't be hurt. I didn't know who it was.

809
01:24:04.64 --> 01:24:09.52
I couldn't make out the form. There was so much battlefield haze, dust and smoke.

810
01:24:09.52 --> 01:24:16.64
It was Lieutenant Joe Marm. He had spotted an enemy machine gun dug into a big termite hill.

811
01:24:16.64 --> 01:24:22.96
It was chewing up both Bravo company ploons after failing to knock it out with a law rocket

812
01:24:22.96 --> 01:24:29.20
and a grenade and a throne grenade he decided deal with it directly. He charged through the fire,

813
01:24:29.20 --> 01:24:33.84
tossed a hand grenade behind the hill and then cleaned up the survivors with his M16 rifle.

814
01:24:33.84 --> 01:24:41.36
The following day, Lieutenant Alde Vetti found a dead north Vietnamese officer and 11 enemy soldiers

815
01:24:41.36 --> 01:24:49.60
sprawled behind that termite mound. Says Deal, Joe Marm saved my life and the lives of many others.

816
01:24:51.04 --> 01:24:54.96
Lieutenant Marm staggered back to his position with a bullet wound to his jaw and neck.

817
01:24:55.84 --> 01:25:00.24
He joined a growing stream of walking wounded flowing back toward the battalion aid station,

818
01:25:00.24 --> 01:25:05.76
sergeant Keaton treated Marm's wound and one of Bruce Kondel's crandell's

819
01:25:05.76 --> 01:25:12.000
queues evacuated him to the rear. Within days Lieutenant Joe Marm was recuperating at Vali

820
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:18.80
forj army hospital near his home in Pennsylvania. In December of 1966, Joe Marm reported to the

821
01:25:18.80 --> 01:25:25.04
Pentagon with a secretary of the army acting on behalf of President Lyndon Johnson, presented him

822
01:25:25.04 --> 01:25:32.88
with the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest award for Vali.

823
01:25:41.52 --> 01:25:45.76
Joe Marm's heroic action unfortunately failed to open the door to the Kondoff Platoon.

824
01:25:46.88 --> 01:25:51.60
Bravo Company had progressed only about 75 yards, Alpha Company a bit further.

825
01:25:51.60 --> 01:25:59.52
All through of Nadal's Platoon leaders were now either dead or wounded as were many of his non-combs.

826
01:26:00.64 --> 01:26:05.60
Worst yet, Alpha Company's first platoon had gotten out ahead of the two other and was heavily

827
01:26:05.60 --> 01:26:11.68
engaged with perhaps a hundred enemy. Some of the north, some of the Alpha Troopers bypassed the

828
01:26:11.68 --> 01:26:18.80
enemy in dense brush and those north Vietnamese had opened up on them. Not only were we unable to

829
01:26:18.80 --> 01:26:24.24
punch through the rescue herics platoon, we were now in danger of having another platoon cut off.

830
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000
And again, I apologize. It's one of the things I should have talked about was the way this terrain is set up.

831
01:26:31.12 --> 01:26:35.76
It's that there's a lot of grass. Like I would say waist high grass, maybe a little bit taller than

832
01:26:35.76 --> 01:26:42.80
waist high. And if you take cover, you can't say anything. Because you're in grass. If you stand up,

833
01:26:42.80 --> 01:26:50.000
you get shot. So it's a terrible catch-22. Do you stand up so you can see what's happening and see where

834
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.60
people are going and see where the enemy is maneuvering? And you might get shot or do you lay down?

835
01:26:53.60 --> 01:26:56.32
Were you take cover? Do you have a better chance of not getting shot? But you can't see anything.

836
01:26:58.88 --> 01:27:03.36
Captain Deeric ran up to me and shouted, Gary Owen's sir. Now this is this is awesome. So

837
01:27:03.36 --> 01:27:09.44
Captain Deeric is the guy that's coming into. He's from 27. He's coming in as reinforcements.

838
01:27:09.44 --> 01:27:15.52
And like I said, Gary Owen is like their war cry. So here we go. Captain Deeric ran up to me and shout,

839
01:27:15.52 --> 01:27:21.52
so this is how more it's awoken. He's on this embroiled war zone. Been taken so many casualties.

840
01:27:22.56 --> 01:27:26.16
And here's what how more it says. Captain Deeric ran up to me and shouted, Gary Owen's sir.

841
01:27:26.16 --> 01:27:31.44
Captain Deeric and Bravo Company, Second Battalion, 7th Cavry, 120 men strong reporting for duty.

842
01:27:33.04 --> 01:27:37.12
His eyes sparkled with excitement and the challenge of the situation. I told Deeric to

843
01:27:37.12 --> 01:27:41.44
assemble his men in a company's 30 yards north west of the command post of act as a

844
01:27:41.44 --> 01:27:48.000
batalion reserve for the time being. That's awesome. Captain reporting, Gary Owen, Gary Owen's sir.

845
01:27:52.80 --> 01:27:57.44
Captain Deeric says, the flight continued for another 20 or 30 minutes with neither side

846
01:27:57.44 --> 01:28:00.64
making headway. It was getting dark and casualties mounted at night. Decided we were not

847
01:28:00.64 --> 01:28:04.32
going to be able to break through. I called Colonel Moore and asked for permission to pull back.

848
01:28:04.32 --> 01:28:10.16
That here's what Colonel Moore says with night approaching, there was no real choice. I did not

849
01:28:10.16 --> 01:28:14.000
want to get into the hours of darkness with my battalion fragmented with the companies in capable

850
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.24
of mutual support and subject to defeat in detail.

851
01:28:21.60 --> 01:28:26.08
Word came over the radio and this and so now this is a specialist.

852
01:28:27.28 --> 01:28:32.40
Gailum bungam who's out there with the lost platoon. Back to the book Word came over the

853
01:28:32.40 --> 01:28:37.44
radio that we would have to hang on until morning. I could not believe what I heard. I thought

854
01:28:37.44 --> 01:28:42.96
there was no way we would be able to do that. Others thought the same thing. Clark,

855
01:28:42.96 --> 01:28:49.28
Kek, asking me, do you think we'll make it? I didn't know. But I said we have to pray and pray hard.

856
01:28:50.16 --> 01:28:55.36
It was a big question mark in all of our minds. We had to keep our cool and bear down.

857
01:28:55.36 --> 01:29:01.04
Now we're here from Al Morrigan. I now considered the toll this day's fighting had taken.

858
01:29:02.40 --> 01:29:09.12
Tonya and Dados, Alpha Company had lost three officers and 31 enlisted men killed or wounded.

859
01:29:10.40 --> 01:29:15.04
And now reported effective strength of two officers in 84 enlisted.

860
01:29:16.24 --> 01:29:22.16
John Herron's Bravo Company had lost one officer and 46 enlisted men killed or wounded. It was

861
01:29:22.16 --> 01:29:28.32
down to four officers and 68 enlisted men with one platoon Herrix trapped outside the perimeter.

862
01:29:30.56 --> 01:29:34.48
For almost eight hours I had been involved in the minute to minute direction of the battle.

863
01:29:35.44 --> 01:29:40.40
Now I wanted to personally walk the perimeter and check the preparations for what promised to be

864
01:29:40.40 --> 01:29:46.08
a tough night and another tough day tomorrow. Just before dark, sergeant made it your plumbly

865
01:29:47.20 --> 01:29:51.12
and I broke away from the command post and set out to check the perimeter talking with the

866
01:29:51.12 --> 01:29:56.40
troopers and getting for a feel for the situation on the ground. What concerned me the most

867
01:29:56.40 --> 01:30:01.92
was the morale of the men. How well the companies were tied in. Their defensive fire plans

868
01:30:01.92 --> 01:30:08.80
and the situation with ammunition and water supplies. Moral among the men was high. Although

869
01:30:08.80 --> 01:30:14.80
there was understandable grief over the friends we had lost. The men and I talked.

870
01:30:16.32 --> 01:30:20.08
The men I talked with realized that we were facing a fierce determined enemy.

871
01:30:20.08 --> 01:30:26.24
But he failed to break through our lines. They knew the fight was an over. I heard weary soldiers

872
01:30:26.24 --> 01:30:32.16
saying things like, we'll get them sir and they won't get through us sir. They're fighting spirit

873
01:30:32.16 --> 01:30:40.56
had not dimmed and they made me proud and humble. In every one of my companies that had landed in

874
01:30:40.56 --> 01:30:47.12
this place this morning there were 15 to 20 soldiers who had less than two weeks left to go in the army.

875
01:30:47.12 --> 01:30:54.80
Some of those men now lay dead, wrapped in ponchos near my command post. The rest of them were

876
01:30:54.80 --> 01:31:01.92
out on that perimeter standing shoulder to shoulder with their buddies ready to continue the fight.

877
01:31:10.56 --> 01:31:16.24
37 miles to the northeast. Bruce Crandell and big Ed Freeman friendly shut down their

878
01:31:16.24 --> 01:31:22.16
hewies at a large, at a huge helicopter pad nicknamed the turkey form outside the wire at Camp Hollow Way.

879
01:31:23.84 --> 01:31:30.88
They had been flying non-stop since 6 a.m. It was after 10 p.m. when Crandell shut down and tried to get

880
01:31:30.88 --> 01:31:37.04
out of the aircraft. That is when the day's activities caught up with me. My legs gave out as I stepped

881
01:31:37.04 --> 01:31:43.92
on the skid and I fell to the ground for the next few minutes I vomited. I was very embarrassed

882
01:31:43.92 --> 01:31:50.48
and it took some time to regain my composure. Someone slipped me a bottle of Konya into my hand

883
01:31:50.48 --> 01:31:56.72
and I took a big slug. It was a waste of good booze. It came up as fast as it went down.

884
01:31:58.56 --> 01:32:03.44
I finally quit shaking and made it to the operations tent to recap the day and plan the next.

885
01:32:03.84 --> 01:32:11.28
The aviation unit had quite a day. We had not suffered a single fatality and we had not left the mission

886
01:32:11.28 --> 01:32:19.76
undone. When our infantry brothers called, we hauled the standard for combat assaults with helicopters

887
01:32:19.76 --> 01:32:28.48
had been set on this day. I wondered about tomorrow. Would it be worse? I wasn't sure I could handle

888
01:32:28.48 --> 01:32:48.000
another day like today. Then again, I thought about the troops in X-ray. Then the choice was not mine to make.

889
01:32:49.44 --> 01:32:55.28
Then here's how more talking about the wounded back the book, all of the wounded, all of our

890
01:32:55.28 --> 01:33:01.20
wounded flown out of X-ray by Krandels Huey's ended up at Charlie Company, 15th medical battalion,

891
01:33:01.20 --> 01:33:05.04
first cavalry division, which was temporarily set up in tents that camp all the way.

892
01:33:06.24 --> 01:33:13.04
The executive officer of Charlie Med was Captain George H. Kelling 28 from St. Louis, Missouri.

893
01:33:13.04 --> 01:33:17.60
Charlie Med's five surgeons tried to stabilize the soldiers coming off the helicopters.

894
01:33:18.40 --> 01:33:22.56
The treatment we provided says Kelling was designed to keep the blood flowing through the patient

895
01:33:22.56 --> 01:33:26.88
system until he could be gotten to a hospital, which had the personnel and equipment to perform

896
01:33:26.88 --> 01:33:34.56
definitive surgery. Charlie Med's doctors tied off perforated blood vessels to stop the hemorrhaging

897
01:33:34.56 --> 01:33:41.20
and then pumped in whole blood. Kelling recalls that many of the casualties were rapidly bleeding

898
01:33:41.20 --> 01:33:46.40
to death, so it was a race against time to get blood into the soldier faster than he was losing it.

899
01:33:46.40 --> 01:33:52.32
Even while the surgeons were trying to tie off bleeders, we threw caution to the wind and gave

900
01:33:52.32 --> 01:33:57.84
a patient four cut downs, which is an intervenous tube tied into blood vessels, with four

901
01:33:57.84 --> 01:34:03.52
corpsmen squeezing the blood bags as hard as they could. It was not unusual for the patient to

902
01:34:03.52 --> 01:34:08.40
shiver and quake and lose body temperature from the rapid transveusion of so much cold blood.

903
01:34:10.08 --> 01:34:17.36
Both the alternative, what's a let them die? So they're giving blood directly into the veins

904
01:34:17.36 --> 01:34:23.12
and they've got corpsmen standing there, squeezing the bags of blood to try and keep people alive.

905
01:34:29.20 --> 01:34:36.40
Back on LZ, here's Sergeant John Stedellan talk and they probed us all night long. We had a few

906
01:34:36.40 --> 01:34:41.68
men wounded. I'd never been in a situation like that. When they would come at us, they would come

907
01:34:41.68 --> 01:34:54.96
screaming and we could hear bugles. As darkness fell, savages on the radio with Lieutenant Bill

908
01:34:54.96 --> 01:35:01.68
Riddle, Herons artillery forward observer, walking the high explosive barrage is all around the

909
01:35:01.68 --> 01:35:08.48
cut off platoon. All of us were lifted off the ground by the impact and covered with dirt and branches,

910
01:35:08.48 --> 01:35:15.28
bung them recalls. Savage told them on the radio that was right where we want them. We

911
01:35:15.28 --> 01:35:20.16
hauled it was too close but I looked back where those first rounds hit and saw three men running

912
01:35:20.16 --> 01:35:25.04
towards us. We opened up. They must have been crawling up on our position when that artillery

913
01:35:25.04 --> 01:35:31.44
came in. They would sneak in as close as ten yards or less and many times just stand up to laugh at us.

914
01:35:31.44 --> 01:35:39.52
We would mow them down. It begins to work on your mind. What are they laughing at? I couldn't believe it.

915
01:35:43.52 --> 01:35:47.60
The North Vietnamese launched three separate attacks to keep the pressure on the trap

916
01:35:47.60 --> 01:35:52.16
to Second Platoon during that long night. Each time sending about 50 men against the Americans

917
01:35:52.16 --> 01:35:58.16
in each time being beaten back by artillery and rifle fire. Savage had seven men on hurt and

918
01:35:58.16 --> 01:36:04.24
13 wounded. Nine others were dead. Some of the lost platoon's wounded continued to fight

919
01:36:04.24 --> 01:36:11.44
including Sergeant Ruben Thompson who had been shot through the chest. The platoon later

920
01:36:11.44 --> 01:36:16.56
heard still another large enemy force moving down the northern trail toward X-ray and again

921
01:36:17.12 --> 01:36:23.36
brought artillery fire down on them. This was followed by a flurry of hand grenades back and forth

922
01:36:23.36 --> 01:36:28.88
at about 4.30 a.m. Within an hour the first lightning eastern sky revealed dozens of

923
01:36:28.88 --> 01:36:35.52
khaki clad enemy dead scattered all around the little no. The trap platoon had survived the longest

924
01:36:35.52 --> 01:36:42.96
night any of them would ever know. They checked their ammunition and prepared to receive a dawn attack.

925
01:36:44.32 --> 01:36:52.56
And here's one of the platoon sergeants talking. Platoon sergeant Robert

926
01:36:52.56 --> 01:37:00.000
Jemons and Jemison. At first light we sent out a patrol. Staff sergeant Sidney Cohen

927
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:06.40
spec for Arthur L. Bronson and three other men were picked to go says Jemison. They saved us from

928
01:37:06.40 --> 01:37:11.36
being surprised. They spotted the enemy on their way back into an attack position. They came running

929
01:37:11.36 --> 01:37:16.24
back with Bronson screaming their common serge a lot of them get ready. I told the machine gun

930
01:37:16.24 --> 01:37:24.08
ers to hold their fire until they were close. PFC Willy Godbolt 24 of Jacksonville Florida was

931
01:37:24.08 --> 01:37:28.88
hit while firing from his position 20 yards to sergeant Jemonson's right. Jemonson remembers

932
01:37:28.88 --> 01:37:48.80
Godbolt hollering somebody helped me. I had I'll go get him. Lieutenant Joe Hagan.

933
01:37:48.80 --> 01:37:52.80
I will go to the Jemonson.

934
01:37:52.80 --> 01:38:12.40
Jemonson remembers Godbolt was hollering somebody helped me. I yelled I'll go get him. Lieutenant

935
01:38:12.40 --> 01:38:20.000
Joe Hagan yelled back no I will. Joe Hagan moved out of his position in the fox hole to help

936
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Godbolt and was shot. This was ten minutes or so from the time the firing first broke out.

937
01:38:27.12 --> 01:38:34.72
Struggling the back of the head Lieutenant John Lance Jack. Joe Hagan was killed instantly.

938
01:38:34.72 --> 01:38:43.04
The man he was trying to save PFC Godbolt died of his wounds shortly afterward. The enemy was

939
01:38:43.04 --> 01:38:50.08
now closed to within 75 yards of Edwards line. They were firing furiously some crouch low and at

940
01:38:50.08 --> 01:38:55.76
times crawling on their hands and knees. Others no taller than the elephant grass they were passing

941
01:38:55.76 --> 01:39:01.84
through came on standing up and shooting. They advanced screaming at each other and Edwards men.

942
01:39:01.84 --> 01:39:07.76
Leaders were blowing whistles and using hand and arm signals. A few were even carrying 82

943
01:39:07.76 --> 01:39:14.000
millimeter mortar tubes and base plates. This was clearly in no hit and run affair. They'd come to stay.

944
01:39:19.68 --> 01:39:26.32
And here's Joe Stetland talking. Sergeant John, Sergeant John Stetland. Here's John Stetland talking.

945
01:39:26.32 --> 01:39:32.40
It seemed like half of Italian hit us all at once. He hit us headlong and he hit us strong.

946
01:39:33.04 --> 01:39:38.72
I thought we were going to be overrun. When Charlie hit us he had this strange grazing fire.

947
01:39:38.72 --> 01:39:43.36
He shot right at ground level trying to cut off your legs or if you weren't deep enough in

948
01:39:43.36 --> 01:39:50.08
your fox hole he shot your head off. When he started firing at us it came like torrents of rain.

949
01:39:50.08 --> 01:39:54.96
You just couldn't get your head long up long enough to shoot back. You just stuck up your weapon

950
01:39:54.96 --> 01:40:02.64
pulled the trigger and emptied the magazine. Lieutenant Charlie Hastings are forward.

951
01:40:02.64 --> 01:40:08.40
Air controller had already swung into action. Sensing disaster Hastings made an immediate

952
01:40:08.40 --> 01:40:13.52
instinctive decision. I used the code word broken arrow which meant the American unit on the

953
01:40:13.52 --> 01:40:18.80
in contact was in danger of being overrun and we received all available aircraft and South

954
01:40:18.80 --> 01:40:24.88
Vietnam for close air support. We had aircraft stacked at a thousand foot intervals from

955
01:40:24.88 --> 01:40:30.40
7,000 feet to 35,000 feet each waiting to receive a target and deliver their ordinance.

956
01:40:33.76 --> 01:40:38.000
And here's how more. By now I was convinced that the enemy was making a primary effort to

957
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.96
overrun us from the south and southeast and I alerted the reserve platoon for probable commitment

958
01:40:42.96 --> 01:40:49.60
into Charlie or Delta company sectors. The noise of the battle was unbelievable. Never before or

959
01:40:49.60 --> 01:41:00.000
since and two wars have I heard anything equal to it. And here's specialist Arthur Viera.

960
01:41:00.88 --> 01:41:06.48
The gunfire was very loud. We were getting overrun on the right side. Lieutenant Croker came out

961
01:41:06.48 --> 01:41:12.56
into the open and all this. I thought that was pretty good. He yelled at me. I got up to hear him.

962
01:41:12.56 --> 01:41:18.80
He holed at me to help cover the left sector. I ran over to him and by the time I got there he was dead.

963
01:41:18.80 --> 01:41:25.04
He had lasted a half an hour. I knelt beside him took off his dad dog tags and put them in my shirt

964
01:41:25.04 --> 01:41:31.04
pocket. I went back to firing my M79 and got shot right in the elbow. My M79 went flying and I was

965
01:41:31.04 --> 01:41:38.40
knocked over and fell backward over the lieutenant. Viera now grabbed his 45 pistol and began firing

966
01:41:38.40 --> 01:41:44.08
it left handed. And he says, then I got hit in the neck and the bullet went right through.

967
01:41:44.08 --> 01:41:50.000
I couldn't talk or make a sound. I got up and tried to take charge and we shot with a third round.

968
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:55.68
That one blew up my right leg and put me down. It went in my leg above the ankle travel

969
01:41:55.68 --> 01:42:01.44
up came back out, then went into my groin and ended up in my back close to my spine.

970
01:42:02.96 --> 01:42:07.28
Just then two stick grenades blew up right over me and tore up both of my legs.

971
01:42:08.72 --> 01:42:12.72
I reached down with my left hand and touched a grenade fragments on my left leg.

972
01:42:12.72 --> 01:42:19.36
And it felt like I had touched a red hot poker. My hands just sizzled.

973
01:42:25.84 --> 01:42:32.08
Unbelievable attack. And I think that script description right there really spells out how

974
01:42:32.96 --> 01:42:38.16
intense this was. And obviously when you got chrome more saying that this is the loudest thing

975
01:42:38.16 --> 01:42:45.84
he's ever heard in two wars. That also confirms what we're dealing with here.

976
01:42:45.84 --> 01:42:50.40
Back to the book at 7.45 a.m. the enemy struck at the left flank of Tonyan Doll's

977
01:42:50.40 --> 01:42:54.56
Alpha Company at the critical elbow where Alpha and Charlie companies were tied in.

978
01:42:55.28 --> 01:43:00.72
We are now under attack from three directions. Grazing fire from rifles and machine guns

979
01:43:00.72 --> 01:43:05.20
shredded the elephant grass and swept over the batained command post in aid station.

980
01:43:05.20 --> 01:43:11.28
Leaves, bark and small blanchers branches fluttered down on us. Several troopers were wounded in the

981
01:43:11.28 --> 01:43:19.20
same command post and at least one was killed. My radio operator, spec for Robert P. Olet.

982
01:43:20.88 --> 01:43:28.32
23 years old had a of a speckled six-fourter from Madawaska main was hit and slumped over in a

983
01:43:28.32 --> 01:43:35.84
sprawl unmoving and seemingly dead. I kept the handset to my ear. And here's Joe Galloway the

984
01:43:35.84 --> 01:43:40.72
reporter. The incoming fire was only a couple of feet off the ground and I was down as flat as I could

985
01:43:40.72 --> 01:43:46.80
get when I felt the toe of a combat boot in my ribs. I turned my head sideways and looked up there,

986
01:43:46.80 --> 01:43:53.12
standing tall was sergeant major basal plumbly. Plumbly leaned down and shouted over the noise

987
01:43:53.12 --> 01:43:59.68
the guns. You can't take no pictures laying down there on the ground, sunny. He was calm, fearless,

988
01:43:59.68 --> 01:44:05.84
and grinning. I fought. He's right. We're all going to die anyways, so I might as well take mine

989
01:44:05.84 --> 01:44:11.76
standing up. I got up and began taking a few photographs. Plumbly moved over to the aid station,

990
01:44:11.76 --> 01:44:18.32
pulled out his 45 chambered around and informed Dr. Carrera and his medics, gentleman, prepared to

991
01:44:18.32 --> 01:44:26.88
defend yourselves. So Plumbly thought they were getting over onto or at least going to get close.

992
01:44:26.88 --> 01:44:31.68
You're in the aid station. That's in the center of this whole perimeter. And he's pulling out his 45

993
01:44:31.68 --> 01:44:40.48
and saying, prepare to defend yourselves. You can't make that up. Specialist,

994
01:44:40.48 --> 01:44:47.20
willard F. Parish, 24 years old, an unedivable bristow, Oklahoma was an assistant squad leader of

995
01:44:47.20 --> 01:44:52.16
one of Charlie Company's 81 millimeter mortar squads. Parish was one of the mortar men who had

996
01:44:52.16 --> 01:44:56.96
been outfitted with his spare machine guns and rifles collected from our casualties and put on the

997
01:44:56.96 --> 01:45:03.20
Delta Company perimeter. Parish recalls, when we were hit, I remember all the trace around and I

998
01:45:03.20 --> 01:45:08.64
wondered how even an ant could get through that. Back to a right, we started hearing the guys

999
01:45:08.64 --> 01:45:14.000
following, they're coming around, they're coming around. I was in a foxhole with a guy from Chicago,

1000
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:21.60
J. P. F. C. James E. Coleman, and he had an M-16. I had my 45 and his 45 and I had an M-60 machine gun.

1001
01:45:21.60 --> 01:45:27.20
We were set up facing out to the tall grass. I was looking out front and I could see some of

1002
01:45:27.20 --> 01:45:31.76
the grass going down like someone was crawling at it. I hollered, who's out there? Nobody answered

1003
01:45:31.76 --> 01:45:37.20
and I hollered again. No answer. I turned to, I turned to Coleman, burn his ass.

1004
01:45:37.20 --> 01:45:44.40
Coleman said, my rifle's jammed. I looked at him and him at me. Then I looked to the front and they

1005
01:45:44.40 --> 01:45:49.92
were growing out of the weeds. I just remember getting that machine gun from there on out and the

1006
01:45:49.92 --> 01:45:54.40
training takes over and you put your mind somewhere else because I really don't remember what specifically

1007
01:45:54.40 --> 01:46:01.52
I did. I was totally unaware of the time, the conditions. On that M-60 machine gun, according to the

1008
01:46:01.52 --> 01:46:08.24
extracts from his silver star citation, specialist Paris, Paris delivered lethal fire on wave after

1009
01:46:08.24 --> 01:46:15.68
wave of the enemy until he ran out of ammunition. Then standing up under fire with a 45 pistol

1010
01:46:15.68 --> 01:46:22.08
in each hand, Paris fired clip after clip into the enemy who were 20 yards out and he stopped their

1011
01:46:22.08 --> 01:46:30.40
attack. Says Paris, I feel like I didn't do any more than anybody else did up there. I remember a lot

1012
01:46:30.40 --> 01:46:36.64
of noise, a lot of yelling and then all at once it was quiet. The silence out in front of

1013
01:46:36.64 --> 01:46:43.68
Willard Parish was that of this cemetery. More than 100 dead North Vietnamese were later found

1014
01:46:43.68 --> 01:46:59.84
where they had fallen in a semi-circle around his foxhole. 45 in each hand. That's crazy actually.

1015
01:47:01.20 --> 01:47:09.92
I mean, he's going to a whole other level because you can't reload. You can't reload your

1016
01:47:09.92 --> 01:47:16.72
pistol. Maybe he would stand up fire both just dump it, and he'd be able to get back down reloaded

1017
01:47:16.72 --> 01:47:29.28
both. That's after he used all of the 60 ammo. George Fox 25 and Nathaniel Bird 22 were

1018
01:47:29.28 --> 01:47:34.72
slumped across their silent M-60 machine gun surrounded by heaps of empty shell casings in

1019
01:47:34.72 --> 01:47:41.76
empty ammunition cans. They had died together, shoulder to shoulder, sergeant jemisin pays them the

1020
01:47:41.76 --> 01:47:48.72
ultimate compliment of a professional soldier. Bird and Fox did a great job. They kept firing

1021
01:47:48.72 --> 01:48:05.20
that gun and didn't leave it. They stayed on it to the end. So all this close air sports coming

1022
01:48:05.20 --> 01:48:09.76
in this whole time artillery is coming in the whole time and all of a sudden they get a situation

1023
01:48:09.76 --> 01:48:15.44
where they start. They see aircraft coming overhead with jets coming overhead low pass and they're

1024
01:48:15.44 --> 01:48:24.48
heading towards them and they drop some napalm. So here's how more. I yelled at top of my lungs to

1025
01:48:24.48 --> 01:48:30.72
Charlie Hastings. The Air Force FAC call that son of a bitch off column off. Joe Gallaway heard

1026
01:48:30.72 --> 01:48:35.60
Hastings screaming in the radio, pull up, pull up Matt Dylan says, I can still see the canisters

1027
01:48:35.60 --> 01:48:41.52
tumbling toward us. I remember thinking turn your eyes away so you won't be blinded. I put my

1028
01:48:41.52 --> 01:48:48.64
face into a reporter's shoulder to hide my eyes. That was Joe Gallo-Az. I could hear good time

1029
01:48:48.64 --> 01:48:55.28
Charlie Hastings shouting into his radio, pull up the second jet did. The napalm from the first

1030
01:48:55.28 --> 01:49:01.84
hit some people and caught some ammo on fire. Sergeant Major plundly jumped out to put the fire

1031
01:49:01.84 --> 01:49:07.36
put out the fire around the ammunition. I ran out into the LZ to put an air panel out.

1032
01:49:07.36 --> 01:49:16.08
Sergeant Nye says, two of my people. PFC Jimmy D. Nakayama and specialist five

1033
01:49:17.12 --> 01:49:23.92
James Clark were on the other side of me several yards away. Somebody was hollowing and

1034
01:49:23.92 --> 01:49:28.24
Colonel Moore were standing up there hollowing about something about a wingman and I looked

1035
01:49:28.24 --> 01:49:33.04
up. There were two planes coming and one of them had already dropped his napalm and everything seemed

1036
01:49:33.04 --> 01:49:39.84
to go in slow motion. Everything was on fire. Nakayama was all black and Clark was burned and bleeding.

1037
01:49:41.68 --> 01:49:46.32
And here's Joe Gallo-Az. Before I had walked over and talked to the engineer guys in their

1038
01:49:46.32 --> 01:49:52.88
little foxholes, now those same men were dancing in the fire. Their hair burned off in an instant.

1039
01:49:52.88 --> 01:49:58.16
Their clothes were incinerated. One was a massive blisters. The other not quite so bad, but he had

1040
01:49:58.16 --> 01:50:04.80
breathed fire into his lungs. When the flames died down we all ran out into the burning grass.

1041
01:50:04.80 --> 01:50:10.000
Somebody yelled at me to grab the feet of one of the charged soldiers. When I got him,

1042
01:50:10.80 --> 01:50:16.48
the boots crumbled and the flesh came off and I could feel bare bones of his ankles and the palms of my hands.

1043
01:50:19.36 --> 01:50:24.32
We carried him to the aid station. I can still hear their screams.

1044
01:50:24.32 --> 01:50:33.12
Spec 4 Thomas E. Bernlial, a medical man from Bravo Company, second battalion, rushed out

1045
01:50:33.12 --> 01:50:38.64
into the clearing with his kit back to help them napalm victims. Bernlial was shot in the head and

1046
01:50:38.64 --> 01:50:46.96
died within minutes in Lieutenant Ress Corlola's arms. An Oklahoma man, Bernlial had turned 23

1047
01:50:46.96 --> 01:50:54.72
years old just four days before he was killed. Back in the command post,

1048
01:50:55.76 --> 01:51:02.24
our ear forced fact, Charlie Hastings was stunned by all the consequences of the misplaced air strike.

1049
01:51:03.52 --> 01:51:08.72
Hastings were calls after the napalm strike. Colonel Moore looked at me and said something that I never

1050
01:51:08.72 --> 01:51:17.52
forgot. Don't worry about that one, Charlie. Just keep them coming.

1051
01:51:24.72 --> 01:51:30.32
Yeah. I mean, he knows what he's got to do. He's got Hastings that just jered killed some of his own men.

1052
01:51:30.32 --> 01:51:35.44
Wounded some of his own men by fire and he's freaking out. Probably doesn't want to call any more bombs on

1053
01:51:35.44 --> 01:51:42.80
and how more realizes that's what's keeping them alive. Don't worry about that one.

1054
01:51:44.48 --> 01:51:55.20
Just keep them coming. Charlie Company first battalion, seventh cavalry had begun its day

1055
01:51:55.20 --> 01:52:01.28
with five officers in a hundred and six men. My new net had no officers left and only forty-nine

1056
01:52:01.28 --> 01:52:06.96
men on her. A total of forty-two officers and men had been killed and twenty more wounded than two

1057
01:52:06.96 --> 01:52:12.56
and a half hours of vicious hand-to-hand fighting. The bodies of hundreds of slain,

1058
01:52:12.56 --> 01:52:16.16
Vietnamese, North Vietnamese, littered the bloody battleground.

1059
01:52:22.24 --> 01:52:27.92
Speck four, Pat Selic, 24 in a native of Mount Kisco, New York says, I remember one guy had a

1060
01:52:27.92 --> 01:52:35.20
small American flag on the back of his pack. When I saw that, I felt very proud.

1061
01:52:36.16 --> 01:52:40.96
That's something that always stuck with me. This American flag was put on top of a blown-up tree,

1062
01:52:40.96 --> 01:52:48.80
just like a Urujima. Another battle we had won for the United States. That little flag flew

1063
01:52:48.80 --> 01:52:53.04
over landing zone X-ray for the rest of the fight, raising all our spirits.

1064
01:52:53.04 --> 01:53:05.60
And now there's a law in the fighting. And here we go back to the book. During this

1065
01:53:05.60 --> 01:53:10.32
law, the saddest, most painful and hardest duty to endure was collecting our dead and loading

1066
01:53:10.32 --> 01:53:15.84
them on board the helicopters. There were so many that the brigade ordered the big choppers,

1067
01:53:15.84 --> 01:53:22.96
the CH-47 Chinooks. One such helicopter lifted out all 42 of the dead from Charlie Company.

1068
01:53:24.48 --> 01:53:30.48
They came in together, died together, and now left together, wrapped in their green rubber

1069
01:53:30.48 --> 01:53:38.64
ponchos. Speck four, Vincent Cantou, says, we were picking up our dead and placing them in the choppers.

1070
01:53:40.48 --> 01:53:44.64
Some of these guys I had known for two years, you'd I could recognize them only by their

1071
01:53:44.64 --> 01:53:55.28
name tags. Their faces were blown off. It was hard not to get sick. We would look at each other

1072
01:53:55.68 --> 01:54:00.56
and without saying a word, just continue putting our dead on the choppers.

1073
01:54:00.56 --> 01:54:26.48
Now, the Colonel, that's in charge of both battalions. He makes a visit and here we go.

1074
01:54:26.48 --> 01:54:29.92
Mid-morning before Tully arrived, Colonel Tim Brown flew in for a visit.

1075
01:54:30.72 --> 01:54:34.64
Pumly recalls Lieutenant Colonel Moore-Souluded Brown and said, I told you not to come in here.

1076
01:54:34.64 --> 01:54:39.84
It's not safe. Brown picked up his right collar, the bell, and waggled his full Colonel's eagle

1077
01:54:39.84 --> 01:54:47.20
at Moore and said, sorry about that. Dylan and I gave him a situation report. Brown asked whether

1078
01:54:47.20 --> 01:54:52.16
he should stay in X-ray established a small brigade command post and run the show. We recommended

1079
01:54:52.16 --> 01:54:57.68
against that. I knew the area and Bob Tully and I got along just fine. Brown and Ghee agreed.

1080
01:54:58.80 --> 01:55:02.56
Lieutenant Dick Merchants says Colonel Brown had trust and confidence in his commanders.

1081
01:55:03.60 --> 01:55:07.84
I'm aware that some felt he should have landed in X-ray and established a command post. I've never

1082
01:55:07.84 --> 01:55:14.08
accepted that. The first battalion seventh cavalry was probably the finest battalion in Vietnam,

1083
01:55:14.08 --> 01:55:18.000
well-trained, superbly led without standing officers and NCOs throughout the unit.

1084
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:24.08
Brown would have been out of place in X-ray. Besides there was no room for brigade CP.

1085
01:55:25.20 --> 01:55:30.80
I recall it being rather crowded behind that anheil. So, the reason I put that in there is because

1086
01:55:30.80 --> 01:55:36.24
here's the guy that's, you know, how Moore's boss comes in to check on the scene.

1087
01:55:37.04 --> 01:55:41.68
And some people say, oh, he should have stayed there because it was a bad fight and he, in this

1088
01:55:42.96 --> 01:55:46.32
Dick Merchants said, no, like he shouldn't have stayed there. He did the right thing. He came

1089
01:55:46.32 --> 01:55:52.80
visited and left. And by the way, you want to set up a brigade command post. You need to find

1090
01:55:52.80 --> 01:55:56.88
your own little ant hill because this one's all, this one's a, you know, the size of, yeah, it's full,

1091
01:55:56.88 --> 01:56:03.84
that's the size of a car. We got dead mooned everywhere. And so, but it's, it's the important point

1092
01:56:03.84 --> 01:56:09.44
there for my perspective is, you know, the key thing is that he had trust in confidence in his

1093
01:56:09.44 --> 01:56:16.24
officers. He didn't need to go out there and micromanage them. And I'm not saying you could never do that.

1094
01:56:16.24 --> 01:56:19.92
I'm definitely not saying that's the dichotomy leadership. You know, sometimes you might look out

1095
01:56:19.92 --> 01:56:22.16
there and say, there's something going on. I need to get out there and you need to get in the

1096
01:56:22.16 --> 01:56:26.64
weeds and get this problem handle. I need to come out there and support. In this particular case,

1097
01:56:26.64 --> 01:56:29.68
probably wouldn't have been a good idea. How more had it under control at this point? That's why

1098
01:56:29.68 --> 01:56:35.04
they're landing a, uh, a chinook, which is CH47 giant helicopter, much bigger than a Huey. You

1099
01:56:35.04 --> 01:56:41.52
know, it's a slower and at least on on a prochids slower. So, yeah, there's a time to get out there

1100
01:56:41.52 --> 01:56:50.40
in micromanage and there's a time when you let your teams lead. Okay, going back to the book

1101
01:56:50.40 --> 01:56:56.24
in Myron, D'Durric and Lieutenant Rick Ruskola. So, these are the two guys that came from the second

1102
01:56:56.24 --> 01:57:01.60
Patience 7th Cav. And he just talks about him a little bit and I think it's worse worth mentioning

1103
01:57:01.60 --> 01:57:09.36
Rick Ruskola and, uh, Myron D'Durric, Bravo Company, second Patience had two foreign board officers

1104
01:57:09.36 --> 01:57:15.20
whose accents and gun-hol attitudes went to touch of foreign Legion flare. The Ukrainian D'Durric

1105
01:57:16.08 --> 01:57:22.24
and the Englishman Ruskola was or destined over the next 72 hours to become battle field legends in

1106
01:57:22.24 --> 01:57:27.28
the seventh Cav as much for their style as their fearless leadership under fire. And,

1107
01:57:27.28 --> 01:57:35.36
yeah, it's, it's, it's, you can see what these leaders do and you do get to see it.

1108
01:57:36.56 --> 01:57:41.04
But here's when, when D'Durric, remember he touched down and he was told, hey, go, go set up security

1109
01:57:41.04 --> 01:57:45.52
and here we go. Myron D'Durric and his soldiers had not yet been sorely tested but they soon would be.

1110
01:57:46.16 --> 01:57:50.64
During that role, D'Durric made certain that fields of fire and observation were cleared out

1111
01:57:50.64 --> 01:57:54.96
to be on 200 yards. That good fighting positions were dug. That machine guns were placed in

1112
01:57:54.96 --> 01:57:59.60
positions that assured flanking interlocking fire. That trip flare is an anti-intrusian

1113
01:57:59.60 --> 01:58:03.84
devices were installed as far as 300 yards out. That every man was locked down, loaded down with

1114
01:58:03.84 --> 01:58:08.32
ammunition and that ammo, ammo, resupply points were designated. That all radios were checked and

1115
01:58:08.32 --> 01:58:12.88
double checked. Then D'Durric worked very carefully with his artillery forward observer registering

1116
01:58:12.88 --> 01:58:19.36
pre-plan fires across the front. The officer, the officer Lieutenant William Lund had four batteries

1117
01:58:19.36 --> 01:58:27.44
24 hours, registered and adjusted on call. So that's, you ever wonder what, uh, what a military leader

1118
01:58:27.44 --> 01:58:34.40
does. That's what he does right there. Diales everything in. And here he's talking about, uh,

1119
01:58:34.40 --> 01:58:39.68
so one of D'Durric's platoon leaders was Rick Rescordla. And here's what he says about Rick Rescordla.

1120
01:58:39.68 --> 01:58:44.80
Rick Rescordla first platoon leader was six months out of OCS at the infantry school at four

1121
01:58:44.80 --> 01:58:49.36
betting. But he had arrived there with a wealth of good training already in under his belt. He had

1122
01:58:49.36 --> 01:58:54.16
served in the British Army in Cyprus and with the Colonial Police in Rhodesia and he knew what

1123
01:58:54.16 --> 01:59:00.32
soldiering was all about. What he did to prepare his position and his men speaks for his professional

1124
01:59:00.32 --> 01:59:05.52
them. So here's what Rick Rescordla did. Rick Rescordla walked a terrain and tried to see it from

1125
01:59:05.52 --> 01:59:10.80
the enemy's point of view. That's critical. What's the enemy thinking? Scrub brush elephant grant,

1126
01:59:10.80 --> 01:59:15.84
grass, ant hills and some ground cover stretched to the front. The ground was not as flat as it

1127
01:59:15.84 --> 01:59:20.40
first appeared but had seams and thick ruts stretching off to the south with a slight incline away from

1128
01:59:20.40 --> 01:59:26.000
his positions. The hasty prone shelters dug by Charlie company first battalion had been dug after

1129
01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:32.40
nightfall under enemy pressure. Rescordla moved his men back 50 yards, which not only shortened

1130
01:59:32.40 --> 01:59:36.80
the sector but meant the enemy would now have to leave the trees and cross 40 yards of mostly

1131
01:59:36.80 --> 01:59:43.76
open area to reach Bravo Company Foxholes. Rescordla recalls, because of our short lines,

1132
01:59:43.76 --> 01:59:49.68
I decreased the number of Foxholes. Three manholes were constructed. The M60 machine guns were said

1133
01:59:49.68 --> 01:59:54.96
on principle directions of fire from which they could switch to final protective grazing fire

1134
01:59:54.96 --> 02:00:00.48
interlocking with each other and with the machine guns on our flanks. Foxholes and parapets were

1135
02:00:00.48 --> 02:00:06.48
built in detail. I tested the holes. Some were so deep the occupants could not even see the

1136
02:00:06.48 --> 02:00:12.72
pair over the parapet. In these cases firing steps were built back up. Two hours before dusk,

1137
02:00:12.72 --> 02:00:19.76
sergeant E S. Bach, A27 and sergeant Thompson organized a booby trap detail. Carefully they rigged

1138
02:00:19.76 --> 02:00:25.52
grenades and trip flares far out on the main avenues of approach. Claimer mines, claimer mines

1139
02:00:25.52 --> 02:00:31.44
would have ice the cake but somewhere they had been lost. A screw up but I felt we were ready to

1140
02:00:31.44 --> 02:00:35.84
tangle with the best of North Vietnamese. And again these guys are luckily there's a wall and they

1141
02:00:35.84 --> 02:00:38.96
have all the time to prepare this and get it all set up. And that's a big difference from what

1142
02:00:38.96 --> 02:00:43.12
happened when these guys hit the LZ and they didn't have any of this stuff. They didn't have any

1143
02:00:43.12 --> 02:00:46.88
the terrain figured out. They didn't have a chance to send it into your personnel. These guys

1144
02:00:46.88 --> 02:00:53.20
are taking advantage of that tactical situation to get up there and make things right. And you know,

1145
02:00:53.20 --> 02:00:56.80
both of those guys, you can see that's what a leader does. That's what a leader does. They make

1146
02:00:56.80 --> 02:01:02.24
sure things are right. They make sure you're ready to win. And you can do that and it will

1147
02:01:02.24 --> 02:01:08.16
that applies to every leader and every position and every industry and every team in the world.

1148
02:01:08.16 --> 02:01:14.32
The leader is stepping up and making sure we are going to be prepared to win. And by the way, this

1149
02:01:15.52 --> 02:01:22.32
Rick Raskorla and this is a little bit of a side note, he ended up working for Morgan Stanley

1150
02:01:22.32 --> 02:01:28.72
as the head of security for Morgan Stanley. And they worked at the Twin D'Hours in New York City.

1151
02:01:28.72 --> 02:01:35.44
That's where Morgan Stanley was. And he felt like they needed to do drills, like they needed to prepare

1152
02:01:35.44 --> 02:01:39.44
and that, like, what happened if the towers came under attack and they ran a bunch of drills.

1153
02:01:40.40 --> 02:01:47.04
And when September 11th came, they ran those drills and got everyone evacuated. And

1154
02:01:49.12 --> 02:01:56.16
Rick Raskorla was last seen on the tenth floor going back up into the building to do a final check

1155
02:01:56.16 --> 02:02:07.12
and make sure that everyone was out and the tower collapsed at 9.59 a.m. and he saved a lot of lives

1156
02:02:07.12 --> 02:02:12.08
that day, not only through his actions on the day of but through his actions in preparing.

1157
02:02:15.84 --> 02:02:24.40
Now, the Vietnamese come, the North Vietnamese come and they bring it. Here we go.

1158
02:02:24.40 --> 02:02:30.000
So the first rush by at least 300 North Vietnamese was beaten off in less than 10 minutes by small

1159
02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:34.16
arms machine gun and artillery fire from the alert and well prepared Bravo Company second battalion troops.

1160
02:02:34.80 --> 02:02:40.64
At 431 a.m. 20 minutes later, they came back to Durex said the intensity of their attack

1161
02:02:40.64 --> 02:02:47.28
increased and I was under the under assault aimed at my three left platoon sectors.

1162
02:02:47.28 --> 02:02:54.16
Screams, shouts and whistles split the night as NVA swept down the mountain straight into the

1163
02:02:54.16 --> 02:03:00.40
smoke clouded killing ground. Now all the mortars of my battalion and Tully's were turned loose.

1164
02:03:01.28 --> 02:03:05.04
Adding their 81 millimeter high explosive shells to the general mayhem.

1165
02:03:06.56 --> 02:03:13.04
Rifleman John Martin, who is in Durex lines says, we kept pouring rifle machine gun fire and artillery

1166
02:03:13.04 --> 02:03:19.76
on them and they broke and ran. I don't think we had any casualties but they were catching hell.

1167
02:03:20.48 --> 02:03:24.96
So now it's totally different story. These guys are dug in. They have all their artillery dialed in.

1168
02:03:24.96 --> 02:03:29.92
They've got their field of fire set up and their attacks come well organized acts with 300 people.

1169
02:03:29.92 --> 02:03:34.72
They don't make it happen. The Vietnamese don't make it happen.

1170
02:03:34.72 --> 02:03:41.60
Yeah. Back to the book. Over on the perimeter of Skorlo's men fought on.

1171
02:03:41.60 --> 02:03:47.20
Our M79 switched to direct fire. Fire delivered to a visible target and lobbed rounds out between

1172
02:03:47.20 --> 02:03:52.96
75 and 100 yards. Still, the shadowy clumps moved closer. RPGs and machine guns

1173
02:03:52.96 --> 02:03:57.20
crackled as they blasted us from the dark line of ground cover.

1174
02:03:57.92 --> 02:04:03.36
Across open fields they came in a ragged line. The first groups cut down after a few yards.

1175
02:04:03.36 --> 02:04:09.20
A few surge right on sliding down behind their dead comrades for cover. An amazing,

1176
02:04:09.20 --> 02:04:14.80
highly disciplined enemy. A trooper cursed and pleaded in a high pitched voice. God damn it stopped

1177
02:04:14.80 --> 02:04:20.000
the bastards. So here they are. They're attacking and when the North Vietnamese soldiers get hit,

1178
02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:25.28
their buddies are coming up behind them taking cover behind their bodies and continuing to assault.

1179
02:04:25.28 --> 02:04:29.12
So this is an indicator. Like I said, this was early in the war. This is 1965.

1180
02:04:29.12 --> 02:04:34.48
And we didn't know that's determined enemy yet. We didn't understand that yet. And here we're

1181
02:04:34.48 --> 02:04:39.28
seeing it for the first time. This is what this is how determined these guys are. They are going

1182
02:04:39.28 --> 02:04:41.92
to attack. They're going to attack through whatever we put out.

1183
02:04:48.08 --> 02:04:53.04
Here's another situation. Steadolin. This is a Steadolin. Whispered orders to his squad,

1184
02:04:53.04 --> 02:04:57.28
telling men on either side of him to hold their fire not to shoot until the enemy stepped out

1185
02:04:57.28 --> 02:05:01.84
into that open space right in front. Suddenly a flare and a booby trap went off and they were

1186
02:05:01.84 --> 02:05:06.40
there in the grass shooting at us. I took around just above the elbow, nothing really just a

1187
02:05:06.40 --> 02:05:11.84
stitch or two and a piece of tape after the fight. Nobody shot back. Then they stepped into that

1188
02:05:11.84 --> 02:05:18.08
open area. The flares were burning. They were lit up and it was easy. We opened up and picked them off.

1189
02:05:18.08 --> 02:05:24.16
It was a light attack. Then they hit us harder 30 minutes later, blowing bugles, blowing whistles.

1190
02:05:24.16 --> 02:05:30.56
We killed them all. Then some white phosphorus came in about 15 in front of my hole and I lost

1191
02:05:30.56 --> 02:05:37.36
most of my web gear in my shirt. Had about eight burns on one arm. John Steadolin sat there

1192
02:05:37.36 --> 02:05:42.64
under the light of the flares and used the point of his bayonet to quickly dig the still burning

1193
02:05:42.64 --> 02:05:47.84
Willie Pete fragments out of his flesh. White phosphorus is a type of munition that we use and

1194
02:05:47.84 --> 02:05:52.32
it's it's white phosphorus and it hits and blows up and it's on fire. It's a little pieces of

1195
02:05:52.32 --> 02:06:02.08
burning hot metal and he's picking it out of his arm. During the two and a half hours of the attack

1196
02:06:02.08 --> 02:06:07.12
against a deer-exceptor, the rest of the x-ray perimeter had been quiet. Two quiet. Dylan and I discussed

1197
02:06:07.12 --> 02:06:12.88
the possibility of conducting a reconnaissance by fire to check for presence of the enemy elsewhere on

1198
02:06:12.88 --> 02:06:19.12
the line. We had plenty of ammunition and what the hell? The enemy knew where our lines were by now

1199
02:06:19.12 --> 02:06:26.96
as well as I did. We passed the word on the battalion net at precisely 655am every man on the perimeter

1200
02:06:26.96 --> 02:06:32.80
would fire his individual weapon and all machine guns for a full two minutes on full automatic.

1201
02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:38.40
The word was to shoot up trees and hills bushes and high grass forward of the

1202
02:06:38.40 --> 02:06:43.12
fort of and above the American positions. Gunners would shoot anything that worried them.

1203
02:06:43.12 --> 02:06:48.88
By now we had learned to our sorrow that the enemy used the night to put snipers and trees

1204
02:06:48.88 --> 02:06:57.20
ready to do damage at first light. Now was the time to clean up out front. At the stated time,

1205
02:06:57.20 --> 02:07:03.60
our perimeter erupted in ear splitting up roar and immediately a force of 30 to 50 north Vietnamese

1206
02:07:04.32 --> 02:07:12.08
rose from a cover 150 yards forward of Joe's, Saudini's alpha company, second battalion lines

1207
02:07:12.08 --> 02:07:16.64
and began shooting back. The mad minute of firing triggered their attack prematurely.

1208
02:07:17.36 --> 02:07:20.88
Our artillery fire was instantly brought in on them and the attack was beaten off.

1209
02:07:22.08 --> 02:07:26.24
When the shooting stopped, one dead sniper dangled by his rope from a tree in

1210
02:07:26.24 --> 02:07:31.20
Fort of Dyricks left most position. Another dropped dead out of a tree almost immediately

1211
02:07:31.20 --> 02:07:36.40
forward of John Harrow's John Harrow's Bravo Company. First battalion command post.

1212
02:07:37.52 --> 02:07:41.28
A third-veid north Vietnamese sniper was killed in the hour later when he tried to climb down

1213
02:07:41.28 --> 02:07:47.92
from from history and run for it. Sergeant Stedelen's arm speckled with white phosphorus

1214
02:07:47.92 --> 02:07:53.92
burns began hurting him now. I was sent back to the aid station where my arm was bandaged

1215
02:07:53.92 --> 02:07:59.52
and I was waiting to be met a backed out. The more I sat there, the more I realized I couldn't

1216
02:07:59.52 --> 02:08:03.76
in good faith get on a chopper and fly out there and leave those guys behind.

1217
02:08:03.76 --> 02:08:11.76
So I took the sling off my arm and went back out. Somebody asked, where are you going?

1218
02:08:12.80 --> 02:08:17.68
I said, back to my foxhole. Nobody said anything else.

1219
02:08:21.04 --> 02:08:28.80
So obviously these guys now have gained some good fire superiority, the upper hand in the battle.

1220
02:08:28.80 --> 02:08:35.20
Back to the book, Rescoral and his men had been watching the air show

1221
02:08:35.20 --> 02:08:39.84
appreciatively. We gathered for the last sweep. Suddenly a fighter bomber

1222
02:08:39.84 --> 02:08:43.44
plowed down on us from above. We buried our noses in the holes.

1223
02:08:43.44 --> 02:08:48.64
An express train screamed down in the explosion shook the earth. The bomb landed 30 yards from

1224
02:08:48.64 --> 02:08:54.24
our holes. We came up cursing in the dust and debris. The call came to move out.

1225
02:08:54.24 --> 02:08:59.68
Every available trooper, including Colonel Moore, pushed the perimeter out. This time it was

1226
02:08:59.68 --> 02:09:06.24
no contest at all. We killed 27 more enemy and crushed all resistance. I looked over the field,

1227
02:09:06.24 --> 02:09:11.84
littered with enemy dead, sprawled by ones and twos and heaps across a torn gouged land.

1228
02:09:13.68 --> 02:09:20.64
Blood, body fragments torn uniforms shattered weapons, littered the landscape. It was a sobering

1229
02:09:20.64 --> 02:09:29.20
sight. Those men, our enemies, had mothers too. But we had done what we had to do.

1230
02:09:30.80 --> 02:09:36.16
Aside from wanting to make certain that the deeric and his men did a clean, safe job. I had one

1231
02:09:36.16 --> 02:09:42.96
reason for joining the final assault personally. This is Colonel Moore talking and then it goes to

1232
02:09:42.96 --> 02:09:47.60
Rick Raskola. Rick Raskola watched. Colonel Moore and our sector was rushing up the clumps of

1233
02:09:47.60 --> 02:09:52.72
bodies pulling them apart. What the hell is the Colonel doing up there? Sergeant Thompson asked.

1234
02:09:52.72 --> 02:09:57.52
I shook my head. Later we saw him coming back at the head of men carrying ponchos.

1235
02:09:58.72 --> 02:10:04.24
By 10 30 a.m. Colonel Moore had found what he was looking for. Three dead American troops were no longer

1236
02:10:04.24 --> 02:10:18.80
missing in action. Now they were on their way home to their loved ones. By now, late morning,

1237
02:10:18.80 --> 02:10:23.84
Tuesday, November 16th, the personality of landings owned x-ray had changed. What previously had

1238
02:10:23.84 --> 02:10:29.04
been a killing field had become something else. We moved without impunity in places where movement

1239
02:10:29.04 --> 02:10:35.04
had meant death on the hours before. Except for our own artillery and air, there was nothing to be heard.

1240
02:10:35.76 --> 02:10:42.56
It was just too quiet, too sudden, and it made me uneasy. That old principle, nothing was wrong,

1241
02:10:42.56 --> 02:10:48.64
except that nothing was wrong. Where was the enemy? Headed back to Cambodia, still on the mountain,

1242
02:10:48.64 --> 02:10:52.32
preparing to attack again, headed north to the eyedring and its precious water.

1243
02:10:52.32 --> 02:11:00.08
And again, the old question. Where were the enemy 12.7 millimeter heavy anti-aircraft machine guns?

1244
02:11:00.08 --> 02:11:03.52
If the enemy commander brought those weapons to bear on us from the mountain above,

1245
02:11:03.52 --> 02:11:08.000
LZX-ray with three American battalions crowding the clearing would present a beautiful target.

1246
02:11:09.52 --> 02:11:14.24
I told Dylan to step up the harassing artillery fire and to keep the air strikes coming in

1247
02:11:14.24 --> 02:11:19.68
and loslobs above us. I told him I wanted a picture perfect telecopter extraction,

1248
02:11:19.68 --> 02:11:27.44
covered by all the firepower we could bring to bear. So, yeah, tides have turned completely.

1249
02:11:27.44 --> 02:11:33.84
And in fact, they've turned so completely that a chanook, which is the big helicopter, flies in

1250
02:11:33.84 --> 02:11:39.92
with a bunch of photographers and television crews and reporters. And they surround,

1251
02:11:41.68 --> 02:11:46.08
they surround Colonel Moran, here we go, back to the book. The other reporters now

1252
02:11:46.08 --> 02:11:50.32
clustered around me. I told him that this had been a bitterly contested battle.

1253
02:11:50.32 --> 02:11:55.76
That clearly we were up against a brave determined and very tough enemy in the North Vietnamese soldiers.

1254
02:11:56.40 --> 02:12:03.36
But that American firepower, discipline, guts, and will to win had carried the day at LZX-ray.

1255
02:12:05.76 --> 02:12:10.32
Brave American soldiers. And the M16 rifle won a victory year, I said.

1256
02:12:10.32 --> 02:12:16.16
My voice choked and my eyes filled with tears as I told the reporters that many of my men

1257
02:12:16.16 --> 02:12:19.68
who had been killed in this place were only a matter of days away from completing their

1258
02:12:19.68 --> 02:12:27.04
service in the army, but they fought and died bravely. As I stood there, I knew that the telegrams

1259
02:12:27.04 --> 02:12:33.52
that would shatter the hearts and lives of scores of American families were already being drafted.

1260
02:12:33.52 --> 02:12:41.60
Now came the body count. And if you remember we talked about this before everyone was always

1261
02:12:42.16 --> 02:12:45.84
they wanted to talk about the body count Vietnam, even at this early stage.

1262
02:12:46.56 --> 02:12:50.32
He was thinking about that back to the book. Now came the body count. From the beginning of the

1263
02:12:50.32 --> 02:12:54.72
fight, I had known that higher headquarters would eventually want to know what damage we had done to the

1264
02:12:54.72 --> 02:12:59.76
enemy. So after each major action in this battle, hating it, I asked my company commanders for

1265
02:12:59.76 --> 02:13:05.04
their best estimates of enemy killed. The battle raging back and forth over three days and two

1266
02:13:05.04 --> 02:13:09.52
nights, it was anything but orderly. There was no referee to call time out for a body count.

1267
02:13:10.48 --> 02:13:16.24
We did the best we could to keep a realistic count of the enemy dead. In the end, it added up to

1268
02:13:16.24 --> 02:13:24.64
834 dead by body count with an additional 1,215 estimated killed and wounded by artillery,

1269
02:13:24.64 --> 02:13:34.24
the air attacks and aerial rocket attacks. On my own, I cut the 834 figure back to 634. A personal

1270
02:13:34.24 --> 02:13:43.12
allowance for the confusion in fog of war and let the 11211 estimated stand. We captured an evacuated

1271
02:13:43.12 --> 02:13:55.76
six enemy prisoners. On our side, we had lost 79 Americans killed in action, 121 wounded and none

1272
02:13:55.76 --> 02:14:09.44
missing. And at this point, they get extracted off the battlefield, including Colonel Moore,

1273
02:14:09.44 --> 02:14:16.64
the last man to leave from his battalion. And here we go back to the book. It was a short,

1274
02:14:16.64 --> 02:14:22.64
fast ride to landing zone Falcon. Just five and a half miles east of X-ray. As we landed among the

1275
02:14:22.64 --> 02:14:27.76
artillery pieces, I saw 75 yards away a group of my troops off in the northwestern edge of the

1276
02:14:27.76 --> 02:14:39.12
LZ. Dean Brellis, an NBC news correspondent, was in LZ Falcon that afternoon. He captured the scene

1277
02:14:39.12 --> 02:14:45.92
in his 1967 book, The Face of South Vietnam. And here's what Dean Brellis wrote.

1278
02:14:47.76 --> 02:14:53.12
How Moore was the last man to come out of the battle. It was the biggest battle he had ever fought.

1279
02:14:53.12 --> 02:15:01.04
He was a lieutenant Colonel and he carried himself like a proud man. His sergeant major was at his

1280
02:15:01.04 --> 02:15:08.96
side. It would need a Shakespeare to describe what happened then. But it was something that was love

1281
02:15:08.96 --> 02:15:18.48
and manliness and pride. It was the moment of the brave. How Moore turned and went from group to

1282
02:15:18.48 --> 02:15:24.72
group of his men. And only a few bothered to get up because there was no exclusivity now. No rank.

1283
02:15:24.72 --> 02:15:32.32
And how Moore did not want them to stand and salute. He was saluting them. He talked with them.

1284
02:15:32.32 --> 02:15:38.32
He thanked them. He was not solemn. And he did not bring to his greetings the salutations of

1285
02:15:38.32 --> 02:15:46.24
a political of a politician. There was no poverty of spirit in his handshook, shake, and he shook

1286
02:15:46.24 --> 02:15:53.20
every man's hand. It was a union of men who had met and defeated the enemy, not forever,

1287
02:15:53.76 --> 02:15:58.08
not in a victory that ended the war, but in a victory over their uncertainty.

1288
02:16:01.12 --> 02:16:07.28
When their hour had come, they had done their job. And it was this thought too that

1289
02:16:07.28 --> 02:16:19.76
our more had in his mind. And he said that if they had won no one else's gratitude, they had his.

1290
02:16:19.76 --> 02:16:44.96
And I think that these men, all these men, have our absolute gratitude for fighting for freedom

1291
02:16:44.96 --> 02:16:50.40
for fighting for each other for fighting for us. And actually the story doesn't end there.

1292
02:16:53.92 --> 02:17:01.12
Nor does the book. And we're going to save it for the next podcast, but we're going to hear about

1293
02:17:01.12 --> 02:17:07.44
the story of LZ Albany, which is a few miles to the north. In still inside the I-Drain Valley,

1294
02:17:07.44 --> 02:17:23.04
where second battalion of the seventh cab moved in and fought. And it's... There's so much

1295
02:17:23.04 --> 02:17:26.64
that I didn't cover in this, in this, what I just covered. There's so much I didn't cover.

1296
02:17:26.64 --> 02:17:29.20
I mean, I didn't even cover the loss, but who does eventually get recovered?

1297
02:17:31.04 --> 02:17:33.68
Read the book. I should have left that out. Spoiler alert.

1298
02:17:33.68 --> 02:17:43.44
But there's so much in there. There's so much... So many lessons learned, so much

1299
02:17:44.72 --> 02:17:52.000
action, so much good description. And so many heroes and so much sacrifice. I don't even think

1300
02:17:52.000 --> 02:18:01.60
gratitude. I mean, they gratitude enough. I think we owe them more than just gratitude. We owe them

1301
02:18:01.60 --> 02:18:15.76
our best. We owe them our lives, our best lives every day, every moment.

1302
02:18:15.76 --> 02:18:29.36
And remember this sacrifice and what we owe them is we owe them to live our best lives.

1303
02:18:29.36 --> 02:18:47.68
And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So echo. Yeah, well I decompress over here, maybe you can

1304
02:18:49.36 --> 02:18:54.08
get some input on how to support this podcast, or support yourself if you want to.

1305
02:18:54.08 --> 02:19:04.24
Sure. Yeah, if you want to. So of course, the first way is supporting your joined. So we

1306
02:19:04.24 --> 02:19:12.56
talk about supplements, joclo as supplements. That's kind. Joclo joint warfare and super curl.

1307
02:19:12.56 --> 02:19:18.48
Crill oil. Omega 3's very good for you. If you want some of that, get it at originmain.com.

1308
02:19:18.48 --> 02:19:23.36
Right there in the front, or you just click on labs, it's right there. Also there's some good

1309
02:19:25.20 --> 02:19:35.92
geese but before that, give a new product. We do a new product out. Yeah, a new class of product.

1310
02:19:35.92 --> 02:19:42.56
Class of product. I'm going to work out. You're on it. Yeah, it's buzzing on it right now. Yeah.

1311
02:19:42.56 --> 02:19:50.96
So discipline. It's a pre workout. It's a call. You say that's a cool word or that's the name. Both.

1312
02:19:51.92 --> 02:19:57.04
So it's called discipline. Right. So it's pre if technically they call it a pre workout, but we're

1313
02:19:57.04 --> 02:20:03.44
calling it a pre mission. Yeah. Supplement. Well, pre workout would help you with your physical

1314
02:20:03.44 --> 02:20:09.84
activity. Sure. But the discipline has cognitive enhancers in it as well. Right. Because when you're

1315
02:20:09.84 --> 02:20:16.08
on a mission, you just don't need physical strength. You need mental strength. Yeah. So this gives

1316
02:20:16.08 --> 02:20:21.12
you both. Yeah. So if your mission is the workout, boom, there you go. It's a pre workout. If your mission

1317
02:20:21.12 --> 02:20:28.88
is an exam, it's a pre exam. Yes. Supplement. If your mission is a mission,

1318
02:20:29.68 --> 02:20:37.36
well, you're good to go. Oh, pre mission. There you go. Boom. Oh, yeah, get down on. I too can vouch for this.

1319
02:20:37.36 --> 02:20:44.32
Because I'm on it too. Because it should perform well to, you know, display its effects. Also,

1320
02:20:44.32 --> 02:20:51.28
geese and rash guards at origin mean all made in America. The more I think about that, the more of a

1321
02:20:51.28 --> 02:20:57.04
big deal that is. The real big deal. Yeah. Because it's from like, I always say the cotton to the

1322
02:20:58.88 --> 02:21:03.44
the ghee or the, you know, the other stuff that there's a lot of cool stuff on their geese rash

1323
02:21:03.44 --> 02:21:09.44
guards, even a pair of all made in America, origin mean.com. This is about to get them. If you want to,

1324
02:21:10.48 --> 02:21:15.92
I want them. I like them. It's funny. Like everyone's on all of, find myself just wearing all

1325
02:21:15.92 --> 02:21:20.40
origin stuff. Not on purpose, too. It's the kind of, okay, in my favorite shorts, even though they don't

1326
02:21:20.40 --> 02:21:26.40
have them. I know, wearing that, I wear them every other day approximately. And, you know, you just

1327
02:21:26.40 --> 02:21:32.64
find yourself in the stuff. It's so good. That's my opinion. Also, for fitness gear, cool fitness gear.

1328
02:21:32.64 --> 02:21:38.64
You want to, even if you're just doing kettlebells, I say get the artistic kettlebells from on it,

1329
02:21:39.52 --> 02:21:44.72
on it.com slash jockel. That's where you get them. There's all other creative workout stuff on their

1330
02:21:44.72 --> 02:21:51.04
maces and cool jump ropes and battle ropes and whatnot. Pretty much anything if you're getting

1331
02:21:51.04 --> 02:21:58.72
bored with the workout and you want to enhance it in some creative way. Go there on it.com slash

1332
02:21:58.72 --> 02:22:02.80
jockel. Don't get addicted to the website because a lot of good information. So it's kind of a

1333
02:22:02.80 --> 02:22:08.16
catch 20 too good. You can get info on there. A lot of good info. Interesting info. But you might

1334
02:22:08.16 --> 02:22:16.64
spend a lot of time there. So be careful. Also, when you buy this book, we were soldiers once

1335
02:22:16.64 --> 02:22:24.88
and young, but general, how more in jail, galo, you know what I was thinking? I have no idea

1336
02:22:24.88 --> 02:22:29.92
what you're thinking. So, sometimes, you're about to hear that. If you watch the movie a few good

1337
02:22:29.92 --> 02:22:40.56
men, I think it's a bit more. Yes. She plays a jaggle with 10, yes. I see the movie. Her name, the

1338
02:22:40.56 --> 02:22:48.88
character name is Joanne Galoey, but color Jill. So her name is Jill Galoey. I noticed that.

1339
02:22:48.88 --> 02:22:55.52
Anyway, when you buy this book, we were soldiers. There's no layers that they, those are

1340
02:22:55.52 --> 02:23:00.56
interpreted layers. Those are not layers. Those are coincidences. There's a big difference.

1341
02:23:01.36 --> 02:23:06.16
It's a fine line. Charlie, back with that formed up Delta Force.

1342
02:23:06.16 --> 02:23:12.48
Sure. Being in this book, but that's layers. That's layers. Yeah. Yeah. I would come from those layers

1343
02:23:12.48 --> 02:23:20.56
for sure. I don't know. I still feel like Jogalo is layers somewhere. I don't know what if they

1344
02:23:21.36 --> 02:23:28.72
negative. No of this. These stories in me. And they named the good. They could. Negative.

1345
02:23:29.52 --> 02:23:33.84
Maybe maybe not. And if they did, they failed. They failed. Yeah, because

1346
02:23:33.84 --> 02:23:40.56
Jill got it wrong. God after it. Yeah. So, will Jill and Galoey kind of got it? No. Not really.

1347
02:23:40.56 --> 02:23:48.40
Wait, she convinced me. Oh. All right. Either way. I still think it's layers. Either way.

1348
02:23:48.40 --> 02:23:55.28
When you buy this book, we have a list of the website along with all the books that Jogalo reviews.

1358
02:24:55.28 --> 02:24:59.84
sort of thing. Boom. Most people don't care what we look like. No. I don't. I don't think so.

1359
02:24:59.84 --> 02:25:05.76
It makes sense that they don't care. No. It doesn't matter. They just care about the content of your

1360
02:25:05.76 --> 02:25:13.60
character. Subscribe to YouTube. That's the point. If you do care about what we look like. Also,

1361
02:25:13.60 --> 02:25:21.04
this excerpts on there. Good way to get little bits of lessons messages from Jogalo.

1362
02:25:21.04 --> 02:25:28.24
Sheryl, so you don't have to share the whole two and a half ish hour podcasts. You can just share

1363
02:25:28.24 --> 02:25:35.76
the excerpts. Pass them on. Let someone else learn these lessons with you. Also,

1364
02:25:35.76 --> 02:25:40.96
Jogalo's a store. It's called Jogalo's store. Name it after him. Jogalo's door.com.

1365
02:25:41.76 --> 02:25:48.32
That is where you can get the cool shirts. I think they're cool. And I think it goes beyond just my opinion

1366
02:25:48.32 --> 02:25:54.64
because people have emailed me and been like, hey, these are cool. Because I made sure they're not

1367
02:25:54.64 --> 02:26:00.40
the low quality. People in this study share brand or if they're printing sure they're like,

1368
02:26:00.40 --> 02:26:04.80
hey, let me get the cheap ones. I don't have to spend a lot of money. Play it safe. All this stuff.

1369
02:26:04.80 --> 02:26:10.88
I didn't do that. I got the good ones. Stuff that I would actually wear regardless of what's

1370
02:26:10.88 --> 02:26:15.36
printed like you wearable. They're wearable. That's how I put it. Anyway, that's all I know. They're

1371
02:26:15.36 --> 02:26:21.60
good. I'm wearing one now. Yeah. Correct. Me too. Boom. See, I wouldn't wear it if I didn't want to

1372
02:26:21.60 --> 02:26:25.84
wear it. So anyway, they're very good. That's where you can get the shirts. There's women's stuff on

1373
02:26:25.84 --> 02:26:31.52
there. Also, this rash cards on there for activities such as surfing. You get to warrior kid rash

1374
02:26:31.52 --> 02:26:37.68
card out there. Yeah. Warrior kid rash card should be reached on there. Should be on there.

1375
02:26:38.48 --> 02:26:46.08
I vowed to get them in time to ship for Christmas. So that would be like today. So go on there.

1376
02:26:46.08 --> 02:26:55.04
And that's the my vow. That's the right word. Vow. I vowed to do this. That means you better succeed.

1377
02:26:55.04 --> 02:26:58.72
Yeah. You know, that's my vow. Okay. So anyway, yeah. Yeah. Some rash cards on there for

1378
02:26:58.72 --> 02:27:03.36
just surfing. I'm going to kind of cool activity, cycling, whatever. Anything you want range of

1379
02:27:03.36 --> 02:27:10.48
motion to be maintained 100% and performance be increased by 19%. I think it's up to 21%.

1380
02:27:10.48 --> 02:27:15.36
Yeah. Reverse back from the field. Yeah. Yeah. I think that kind of average because some people

1381
02:27:15.36 --> 02:27:21.36
a little bit more, you know, so those people, they push the average up. I think that's how it works.

1382
02:27:21.36 --> 02:27:25.60
Anyway, cool stuff on there, check it out. Nothing gets something. But if you want something,

1383
02:27:27.04 --> 02:27:33.12
then you get something and it supports podcasts. Good way to support. Who is on there as well?

1384
02:27:33.12 --> 02:27:39.28
Fick or once? They might be running line might have to get some more. It is winter. I get it.

1385
02:27:39.28 --> 02:27:46.24
But they're the thick ones. Like I said, also psychological warfare. What that is, if you don't

1386
02:27:46.24 --> 02:27:51.52
know, I know we all know what it is already. It's been number one and I too well. Might not be number

1387
02:27:51.52 --> 02:27:56.72
one anymore. That's a long story. Anyway, if you don't know what it is, the unlikely event that

1388
02:27:56.72 --> 02:28:03.28
you don't know what it is is what it is. It's an album with tracks, jockel tracks. Each track is designed

1389
02:28:03.28 --> 02:28:11.68
to help you through moments of weakness when you're on your path. When you're on your war path.

1390
02:28:13.04 --> 02:28:18.16
I mean, you know, I don't know. Nonetheless, when you're on the path of discipline,

1391
02:28:18.16 --> 02:28:23.20
right, you're on the program, you're on your campaign against weakness. You hit little. It's not

1392
02:28:23.20 --> 02:28:30.000
just one smoother out and it's not a one straight road either. And it's riddled. Riddled.

1393
02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:40.88
Every day. Probably every minute, literally riddled with distractions. Everyone's in a while.

1394
02:28:40.88 --> 02:28:46.24
You'll hit moments of weakness whether it's a speed bump distraction, lack of energy,

1395
02:28:47.12 --> 02:28:57.20
boredom, repetitiveness, tediousness, tediousness. That's a word or it. That's what psychological

1396
02:28:57.20 --> 02:29:03.20
warfare is for. It's a little spot for those moments. You don't want to wake up early. Every single

1397
02:29:03.20 --> 02:29:09.04
day. Ah, we got the solution for that. Listen to the little track. Jockel, pragmatically telling you.

1398
02:29:11.52 --> 02:29:15.60
I can get over that little moment of weakness. Same thing with wanting to skip the workout for

1399
02:29:15.60 --> 02:29:22.24
the day. That was mine. That was mine. Not anymore. Jack. And yeah, there's a bunch of them for

1400
02:29:22.24 --> 02:29:27.60
all kinds of stuff. Keeping on the diet. It's a good one. That's what psychological warfare is. Very effective.

1401
02:29:27.60 --> 02:29:32.96
100% affected. That's a bold statement. And you can get Jockel white tea on Amazon,

1402
02:29:32.96 --> 02:29:38.32
which will make you deadlift 8,000 pounds. Factually, confirmed confirmed. You can get some

1403
02:29:38.32 --> 02:29:45.28
books on there. Way the warrior kid. Good Christmas gift. And it's also a good whatever gift. So

1404
02:29:45.28 --> 02:29:52.000
get a kid on the path. Get them on the path. Got so much great feedback on that. Extreme ownership.

1405
02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:58.80
This is for leading at every level in combat in business and in life. Extreme ownership.

1406
02:29:58.80 --> 02:30:03.36
Written meat by meat and my brother, life, babbin. Also from an individual perspective.

1407
02:30:05.52 --> 02:30:08.80
If you want to get yourself on the path, there's no better gift than discipline.

1408
02:30:08.80 --> 02:30:13.04
The discipline equals freedom field manual. Everyone to ask me for workouts. That's where they are.

1409
02:30:14.08 --> 02:30:18.56
Everyone asks me what I eat. That's where it is. Everyone asks me how much I sleep. That's where it is.

1410
02:30:18.56 --> 02:30:24.32
So get that. If you want the audio version, the audio version is not unautable. The audio version

1411
02:30:24.32 --> 02:30:29.92
of discipline equals freedom. Field manual is on iTunes, Amazon, music, Google Play and all those

1412
02:30:29.92 --> 02:30:39.04
other MP3 distributing platforms. There's another master, the master, which is Escelon Front

1413
02:30:39.04 --> 02:30:45.12
leadership conference. There's two of them. Going to be only two of them in 2018. We don't have

1414
02:30:45.12 --> 02:30:52.40
enough room in the schedule to fit three. One, Washington, DC, or sorry, this is actually not one.

1415
02:30:52.40 --> 02:31:00.000
It's number five. So number five, Washington, DC, May 17th, and then number six, San Francisco,

1418
02:31:10.24 --> 02:31:16.64
people? We have a little bit bigger capacity. Yeah. But we just, we don't have time in this schedule anymore.

1419
02:31:16.64 --> 02:31:23.12
Yeah, I dig it. And we are going to do the roll call for law enforcement, military,

1420
02:31:23.12 --> 02:31:26.64
firefighters. We're going to do that as well. But we haven't locked a date on that one yet.

1421

Also, four leadership in addition to this podcast, in addition to the books,

1429
02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:30.32
up, that sign up and volunteer to make the ultimate sacrifice. Thank you all for protecting us

1430
02:32:30.32 --> 02:32:41.84
and our freedoms and to police and law enforcement. Thanks for protecting us from crime and criminals

1431
02:32:41.84 --> 02:32:49.12
and terrorists right here at home to paramedics. Thanks for coming to us in our time of need when we

1432
02:32:49.12 --> 02:32:56.96

of California calfire. Thanks for your service and your sacrifice and my condolences to those

1434
02:33:03.36 --> 02:33:09.92
who have fallen in recent days and weeks and our thoughts are with the families of the fallen.

1435
02:33:11.36 --> 02:33:18.48
And for everyone else that's listening when you see what men can do when pushed be on the limit

1436
02:33:18.48 --> 02:33:28.56
of human capacity. When you see that, when you're here about it, when you read about it,

1437
02:33:28.56 --> 02:33:38.16
well then remember to push yourself, push yourself every day every moment, get out there and

1438
02:33:38.16 --> 02:33:50.56
get after it. Until next time, this is Echo and Jocco. Out.
