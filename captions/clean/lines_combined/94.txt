00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.86 This is Jocco podcast number 94.
00:00:04.86 --> 00:00:07.84 With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
00:00:07.84 --> 00:00:08.84 Good evening echo.
00:00:08.84 --> 00:00:12.32 Good evening.
00:00:12.32 --> 00:00:17.72 The black cloud of smoke exploded silently outside the open door of the decoda of
00:00:17.72 --> 00:00:24.74 scurrying for the moment my view of the geometrical Dutch landscape deserted, but for a few
00:00:24.74 --> 00:00:27.84 for Lauren cows.
00:00:27.84 --> 00:00:32.96 As soon as the sea had appeared below us, I started to think about the flag, and I knew that everyone
00:00:32.96 --> 00:00:36.68 else in the aircraft must be worrying as well.
00:00:36.68 --> 00:00:42.32 When we crossed the east Anglican coastline, that slight wave of movement had flickered down
00:00:42.32 --> 00:00:47.12 the aircraft as the men checked their watches, calculating the time it would take to fly
00:00:47.12 --> 00:00:53.96 over the sea and come within range of the now alerted German anti-aircraft guns.
00:00:53.96 --> 00:00:59.88 Below us, the air sea rescue launches of the RAF, dotting the water at precise intervals
00:00:59.88 --> 00:01:02.64 were pleasantly comforting.
00:01:02.64 --> 00:01:08.96 The narrow band of beach, which was the coast of Holland, had aroused us once again.
00:01:08.96 --> 00:01:13.40 As the flooded fields flashed into view, private harrisid had leaned across to point
00:01:13.40 --> 00:01:19.20 out the guns and the ground shooting up at the mast ranks of our aircraft.
00:01:19.20 --> 00:01:24.36 At the sound of my batman's voice, which had been silent for the past hour, the men near
00:01:24.36 --> 00:01:29.92 to the open doorway had creamed forward to see what they could, while the rest, anxious
00:01:29.92 --> 00:01:34.36 for the first indications of the enemy, had twisted their necks to peer through the small
00:01:34.36 --> 00:01:37.80 windows at their backs.
00:01:37.80 --> 00:01:45.20 At first I could see nothing, and I was stupidly aggravated that everyone but myself could
00:01:45.20 --> 00:01:48.16 spot gun flashes.
00:01:48.16 --> 00:01:54.88 When came that cloud of smoke producing an odd sense of satisfaction, a reaction which immediately
00:01:54.88 --> 00:01:57.12 shamed me.
00:01:57.12 --> 00:02:00.12 This was the behavior of a small boy.
00:02:00.12 --> 00:02:04.72 For all that, it was satisfying not to feel scared by it.
00:02:04.72 --> 00:02:12.000 Perhaps it was because the experience was not only novel, but in some way, impersonal.
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.96 Looking down the dark tunnel of the aircraft at the double line of soldiers, it was a relief
00:02:16.96 --> 00:02:21.96 to see that all traces of nervousness had disappeared.
00:02:21.96 --> 00:02:29.60 We had been waiting a long time for this.
00:02:29.60 --> 00:02:36.64 So that is the opening of a book called Men at Arnim.
00:02:36.64 --> 00:02:44.32 It was actually sent to me by a guy by the name of James Fennelun and the book was originally
00:02:44.32 --> 00:02:48.72 published under the pseudonym Tom Angus.
00:02:48.72 --> 00:02:55.28 It was about this battle at this place called Arnim, which is in Holland.
00:02:55.28 --> 00:02:59.40 In the book, the units that are doing the fighting, they're not identified.
00:02:59.40 --> 00:03:05.92 They don't say what units they are, but shortly after the book was published, it became
00:03:05.92 --> 00:03:13.12 very clear and it was revealed that the author was an individual named Jeffrey Powell, a British
00:03:13.12 --> 00:03:20.76 Army officer, and that the unit that the book talks about was the 156th Parishute Battalion
00:03:20.76 --> 00:03:27.92 of the British Army, who fought against all odds.
00:03:27.92 --> 00:03:37.44 And really, with misfortune after misfortune for eight days during operation, market garden,
00:03:37.44 --> 00:03:46.80 which is a famous World War II operation, a bold and super aggressive plan, and also the
00:03:46.80 --> 00:03:50.20 largest airborne operation up until that point.
00:03:50.20 --> 00:04:01.36 And the goal was to isolate parts of the German forces and to cut off what's known as the
00:04:01.36 --> 00:04:08.88 road district, which is like the heart of German industry, and then open up a route going
00:04:08.88 --> 00:04:14.88 from through that whole area, take control of the roads in the bridges and be able to punch
00:04:14.88 --> 00:04:17.88 right into the heart of Germany.
00:04:17.88 --> 00:04:25.36 Over 40,000 airborne troops took part in the operation, including America's 80 second
00:04:25.36 --> 00:04:28.88 airborne and the 101st airborne divisions.
00:04:28.88 --> 00:04:36.52 But the deepest, those that jumped deepest into enemy territory were from the British First
00:04:36.52 --> 00:04:45.56 Airborne Division, and that included this battalion, the 156th Parishute Battalion.
00:04:45.56 --> 00:04:54.000 And if you know anything about Operation Market Garden, although it did achieve some beneficial
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000 things, overall, the mission was considered a failure because it didn't actually achieve
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.56 the objectives that it wanted to achieve.
00:05:03.56 --> 00:05:11.08 And as you can imagine, those that were furthest out suffered some absolutely catastrophic
00:05:11.08 --> 00:05:18.44 casualties and people taking prisoner and people killed in action.
00:05:18.44 --> 00:05:20.60 And this is only an eight day.
00:05:20.60 --> 00:05:21.76 This is eight days long.
00:05:21.76 --> 00:05:25.40 So this is this period that we're about to cover is only eight days long, and you're
00:05:25.40 --> 00:05:29.80 going to see that it is vicious.
00:05:29.80 --> 00:05:34.68 And the names were changed in this book.
00:05:34.68 --> 00:05:48.76 But again, this is an account from one of the company commanders inside this battalion.
00:05:48.76 --> 00:05:55.28 So obviously the opening was them flying over to the English Channel and getting ready
00:05:55.28 --> 00:05:57.24 to jump in to Holland.
00:05:57.24 --> 00:05:59.000 And here we go back to the book.
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.84 I braaced myself with the open door, the first man in the stick to jump, gripping the
00:06:03.84 --> 00:06:08.84 fuselage, in case a sudden jerk flung me out too soon.
00:06:08.84 --> 00:06:13.68 Leaning forward, the wind whipped my face, pouring over the details of the plastic Dutch
00:06:13.68 --> 00:06:19.12 landscape below, I could now see one or two cyclists dotting the otherwise deserted country
00:06:19.12 --> 00:06:20.88 side.
00:06:20.88 --> 00:06:24.64 The flicker of the red warning light near my face told me that there was one minute
00:06:24.64 --> 00:06:26.64 to go.
00:06:26.64 --> 00:06:28.68 A railway line flashed below.
00:06:28.68 --> 00:06:32.92 The pattern of the woods was familiar as the view of the stable yard from the office
00:06:32.92 --> 00:06:33.96 window.
00:06:33.96 --> 00:06:38.24 The air photographs and the briefing model of the ground had imprinted the shapes on
00:06:38.24 --> 00:06:40.56 my mind.
00:06:40.56 --> 00:06:43.08 The pilots were dead on target.
00:06:43.08 --> 00:06:48.000 More often than not, in the old days, we had been dropped to stray, but these yanks always
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.24 learned from their mistakes.
00:06:51.24 --> 00:06:53.68 I never saw the red light turn to green.
00:06:53.68 --> 00:06:55.32 Harrison's hand slapped my shoulder.
00:06:55.32 --> 00:06:57.40 I was out of the door.
00:06:57.40 --> 00:07:02.28 The slipstream hit me, flicking me sideways and I fell away just catching a glimpse of
00:07:02.28 --> 00:07:07.52 Harrison in the air above me and the tail of the aircraft flashing out of sight.
00:07:07.52 --> 00:07:15.76 When I was floating suspended gently in mid air, my parachute can be high.
00:07:15.76 --> 00:07:21.32 I looked up at the sky, choked with hundreds of swaying parachutes, most of them patterned
00:07:21.32 --> 00:07:26.88 and green and brown camouflage, but other, others in a galaxy of colors, red and orange,
00:07:26.88 --> 00:07:32.32 purple, blue and yellow vivid against the scattered white clouds.
00:07:32.32 --> 00:07:36.96 Every moment more aircraft arrived to discord, their car goes into the crowded
00:07:36.96 --> 00:07:38.52 air.
00:07:38.52 --> 00:07:41.76 Then I noticed the humming.
00:07:41.76 --> 00:07:44.76 We were being shot at from the ground.
00:07:44.76 --> 00:07:47.56 There were both on the drop zone.
00:07:47.56 --> 00:07:52.76 Something was badly wrong and opposed landing with the enemy firing as we hung from our
00:07:52.76 --> 00:07:53.76 parachutes.
00:07:53.76 --> 00:07:57.56 Parachutes were tried to collect our weapons before we could gather into a cohesive force
00:07:57.56 --> 00:08:02.28 on the ground with something new for us in the British airborne forces.
00:08:02.28 --> 00:08:07.32 So as they're coming down, they're getting shot at. He uses this term throughout the book.
00:08:07.32 --> 00:08:18.88 He calls the German boche BOCHE and where it comes from from what I gathered.
00:08:18.88 --> 00:08:26.40 There's a French word that means it could mean head like Kabosh or something like that.
00:08:26.40 --> 00:08:33.68 It also can mean cabbage and so I guess their their their derogatory slang term was
00:08:33.68 --> 00:08:39.24 these big headed German big cabbage heads and he reduced that down to this term boche and
00:08:39.24 --> 00:08:41.52 it's a common one for them to use.
00:08:41.52 --> 00:08:46.20 They used it a lot in World War I and so this is a hangover from that, but you're
00:08:46.20 --> 00:08:47.36 going to hear it throughout the book.
00:08:47.36 --> 00:08:50.80 That's how he's referring to the Germans.
00:08:50.80 --> 00:08:54.28 Back to the book a sharp pain burned the knuckles of my left hand.
00:08:54.28 --> 00:08:59.72 Blood was seeping from my fingers, a bullet must have hit me, grazed me anyways.
00:08:59.72 --> 00:09:06.48 But now the Heathland was rushing up, raising my hands to lift the webs I pulled and then
00:09:06.48 --> 00:09:11.76 hit the and then the ground hit me with an uncomfortable jar, a bad landing.
00:09:11.76 --> 00:09:19.96 I lay in the sunken road listening to the bullets cracking overhead.
00:09:19.96 --> 00:09:22.16 And they're right, they get right into the mix.
00:09:22.16 --> 00:09:25.64 I mean it's immediately into the mix obviously they're getting shot out in the way down
00:09:25.64 --> 00:09:27.24 and then what soon does they hit the ground?
00:09:27.24 --> 00:09:32.68 It's on back to the book a man with bloodstained shell dressing wrapped around his throat
00:09:32.68 --> 00:09:37.32 walked around the corner of the wooding towards us just as preacher to who's the medic
00:09:37.32 --> 00:09:38.96 finished his work.
00:09:38.96 --> 00:09:43.52 Then came a couple of parties carrying stretchers, the occupant of one unconscious, the
00:09:43.52 --> 00:09:47.60 other with a cigarette between his gray tight lips.
00:09:47.60 --> 00:09:52.08 They were the first stream of wounded men from a variety of units, making their painful
00:09:52.08 --> 00:09:57.44 way towards the dressing station which had been set up in the wood behind us.
00:09:57.44 --> 00:10:00.24 So far sea company had been lucky.
00:10:00.24 --> 00:10:04.88 Only four men were missing and a fifth had turned up late smiling cheerfully despite
00:10:04.88 --> 00:10:07.84 a bullet through his bandaged arm.
00:10:07.84 --> 00:10:12.36 Another four or five were limping and hopping about on strained or twisted ankles, expressions
00:10:12.36 --> 00:10:18.24 of disgust in their faces, victims of the gusty wind on the dropping zone.
00:10:18.24 --> 00:10:21.36 All of them would have to be left behind.
00:10:21.36 --> 00:10:25.44 But then I thought again calculating the figures once more, perhaps we had not been so lucky
00:10:25.44 --> 00:10:33.12 after all, a tenth of the men who had implained that morning were already casualties.
00:10:33.12 --> 00:10:37.56 It had sounded as if all the fighting had happened on the far side of the dropping zone
00:10:37.56 --> 00:10:40.04 in the arm hem dirt direction.
00:10:40.04 --> 00:10:42.56 Now the noise of the battle began to ebb.
00:10:42.56 --> 00:10:46.12 The enemy posts had probably been overrun.
00:10:46.12 --> 00:10:51.40 Neither news nor orders had arrived from battalion headquarters.
00:10:51.40 --> 00:10:55.88 But I knew better than to obstruct the radio net with needless questions.
00:10:55.88 --> 00:11:01.32 So first of all, you're rolling into a situation where you're on your insert and you lose
00:11:01.32 --> 00:11:03.28 10% of your men.
00:11:03.28 --> 00:11:04.96 That's just where you're starting to know.
00:11:04.96 --> 00:11:12.16 If I remember correctly, that is the standard kind of figure that when you're conducting
00:11:12.16 --> 00:11:16.60 a big airborne operation, like when the army conducts big airborne operations, that's
00:11:16.60 --> 00:11:17.60 what they figure.
00:11:17.60 --> 00:11:20.08 They're going to take for casualties on the drop zone.
00:11:20.08 --> 00:11:22.24 Obviously they usually do better than that.
00:11:22.24 --> 00:11:24.88 But for worst case scenarios, that's kind of what they figure.
00:11:24.88 --> 00:11:26.32 And that's where they're at.
00:11:26.32 --> 00:11:29.28 The other thing that I thought was cool is here he is.
00:11:29.28 --> 00:11:32.40 He hasn't heard any word from the battalion HQ yet, but he's not going to jump on the net
00:11:32.40 --> 00:11:34.12 and say, hey, boss, what do you want me to do?
00:11:34.12 --> 00:11:35.12 Hey, what's going on?
00:11:35.12 --> 00:11:36.12 Hey, where do you want me to be?
00:11:36.12 --> 00:11:40.16 Because there's other people that are trying to talk and he's got to just kind of figure
00:11:40.16 --> 00:11:45.80 things out at this point.
00:11:45.80 --> 00:11:49.64 Now he's talking about his own company.
00:11:49.64 --> 00:11:53.04 But here's the report on the rest of the battalion as he figures off.
00:11:53.04 --> 00:11:56.20 And as usual, obviously, I'm not reading the whole book.
00:11:56.20 --> 00:12:00.12 And I'm skipping through big chunks of combat situations.
00:12:00.12 --> 00:12:04.56 But at this point, he figures out what's going on with the battalion going back to the book.
00:12:04.56 --> 00:12:07.92 Casualties in the battalion had not been light.
00:12:07.92 --> 00:12:13.40 Two officers and a hundred men had failed to arrive, among them the plain load which we had
00:12:13.40 --> 00:12:16.44 seen shot down.
00:12:16.44 --> 00:12:20.20 Another load had probably been dropped in the wrong place.
00:12:20.20 --> 00:12:22.96 Ian Hampshire was one of the missing officers.
00:12:22.96 --> 00:12:25.40 Rumor had it that he was dead.
00:12:25.40 --> 00:12:31.76 The other was the intelligence officer whose job Jimmy Gray had now combined with his own.
00:12:31.76 --> 00:12:35.16 Jimmy could not explain the reason for the delay.
00:12:35.16 --> 00:12:37.88 No one seemed to know.
00:12:37.88 --> 00:12:41.48 And that's one of the parts that I didn't go over in the beginning of the book as they're
00:12:41.48 --> 00:12:45.64 flying in as they're seeing flack hit and explode around them.
00:12:45.64 --> 00:12:51.52 He's, you know, they see another one of their aircraft filled with their brothers go down.
00:12:51.52 --> 00:12:55.24 No shoots.
00:12:55.24 --> 00:13:02.72 Now they start getting some coherent input from the battalion and here's what they figured
00:13:02.72 --> 00:13:04.08 out coming back to the book.
00:13:04.08 --> 00:13:07.32 We would move as had already been planned in England.
00:13:07.32 --> 00:13:12.84 The leading company of the battalion with Leslie Doyle's platoon, number nine in the front,
00:13:12.84 --> 00:13:19.32 some 200 yards ahead followed by company headquarters, then Luke Tyler's eight platoon,
00:13:19.32 --> 00:13:23.04 then Douglas Thompson's seven platoon at the back.
00:13:23.04 --> 00:13:29.44 As I had expected, the company was ready to move by the time orders had been given out.
00:13:29.44 --> 00:13:33.000 Two minutes were all that was needed for the men to slide their entrenching tools into
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.72 place, pick up their weapons and sort themselves out.
00:13:36.72 --> 00:13:38.68 No one had removed his equipment.
00:13:38.68 --> 00:13:41.24 It was a lesson which the Colonel had drummed into us.
00:13:41.24 --> 00:13:45.44 No man must ever remove his equipment when the enemy is anywhere near, no matter whether
00:13:45.44 --> 00:13:49.48 he was digging, sleeping, or defecating.
00:13:49.48 --> 00:13:53.88 Never time it may be, day or night, a soldier had only to reach for his weapon to be ready
00:13:53.88 --> 00:13:56.68 to fight or to march.
00:13:56.68 --> 00:14:01.28 Just once this day, just once each day, one man in three at a time was allowed to strip
00:14:01.28 --> 00:14:06.92 so that he could wash and shave and shave they must.
00:14:06.92 --> 00:14:10.84 The last man of nine platoon was disappearing round the corner of the sandy track which
00:14:10.84 --> 00:14:16.40 ran parallel with the railway, line to our nem, when I noticed the Colonel standing
00:14:16.40 --> 00:14:22.08 on the right next to the shell of a still smoking glider which partly blocked the battalion's
00:14:22.08 --> 00:14:23.08 path.
00:14:23.08 --> 00:14:27.36 There was parachuteers that came in, but other people came in on gliders.
00:14:27.36 --> 00:14:29.08 Just big gliders.
00:14:29.08 --> 00:14:33.52 No engine that would get towed by other planes, they're filled with men and they would just
00:14:33.52 --> 00:14:40.16 land these gliders in big open fields.
00:14:40.16 --> 00:14:45.88 The railway was up by the Colonel's side and behind them crouched a knot of radio operators and order
00:14:45.88 --> 00:14:46.88 leaves.
00:14:46.88 --> 00:14:48.92 It was the same as ever.
00:14:48.92 --> 00:14:53.000 The Colonel's eyes were still, but he never missed anything.
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.60 The unfassened pouch from which a grenade or brand magazine could slip.
00:14:57.60 --> 00:15:02.88 The slack chin strap which would fail to hold a running man's steel helmet in place.
00:15:02.88 --> 00:15:08.72 Quietly, the Colonel would indicate the error to whichever passing officer or n-seal was
00:15:08.72 --> 00:15:11.48 responsible for the man.
00:15:11.48 --> 00:15:14.24 Nothing was ever ignored.
00:15:14.24 --> 00:15:19.64 Safely out of range the offender would mumble about the nitpicking old bastard, but the
00:15:19.64 --> 00:15:24.40 abuse was usually perfunctory and good natured.
00:15:24.40 --> 00:15:30.32 All of the new his ways and by now they had learned that his fads mattered.
00:15:30.32 --> 00:15:33.08 So the Colonel's running a tight ship.
00:15:33.08 --> 00:15:34.08 Hmm.
00:15:34.08 --> 00:15:35.08 That's what he's doing.
00:15:35.08 --> 00:15:39.72 Highly disciplined guy and he keeps his troops in check.
00:15:39.72 --> 00:15:42.72 And as you can see they're not offended by that.
00:15:42.72 --> 00:15:50.20 They complain about it a little bit, but they also know it's the right thing.
00:15:50.20 --> 00:15:51.20 Here we go back to the book.
00:15:51.20 --> 00:15:56.44 Although we were moving along our planned route, our role in the battle had been changed.
00:15:56.44 --> 00:16:01.000 Instead of making for the high ground north of Arnem, the whole of the brigade was now
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.68 marching for the bridge to relieve the struggling remnants of the first brigade which
00:16:05.68 --> 00:16:09.60 had been fighting alone there for more than 24 hours.
00:16:09.60 --> 00:16:11.16 One thing was certain.
00:16:11.16 --> 00:16:13.24 So they're mission to change a little bit.
00:16:13.24 --> 00:16:17.24 There's a bridge and first brigade was at this bridge and taken the bridge, but now they're
00:16:17.24 --> 00:16:20.12 getting attacked at that bridge by the Germans.
00:16:20.12 --> 00:16:26.76 And now these guys get this brigade gets the orders to go and help them, go and relieve
00:16:26.76 --> 00:16:27.76 them.
00:16:27.76 --> 00:16:28.76 Back to the book.
00:16:28.76 --> 00:16:33.60 One was certain, parachute infantry were not the fast moving hard-hitting troops depicted
00:16:33.60 --> 00:16:35.64 by the daily press.
00:16:35.64 --> 00:16:40.44 With no more transport in a battalion than four lightly armored carriers and some half
00:16:40.44 --> 00:16:46.44 dozen jeeps nearly everything needed in battle either had to be carried on the backs of soldiers
00:16:46.44 --> 00:16:49.28 or dragged behind them.
00:16:49.28 --> 00:16:53.96 There were no trucks just behind the forward companies loaded with spare ammunition.
00:16:53.96 --> 00:16:59.88 Instead, extra band allures were strong around necks and light anti-tank mines swung from
00:16:59.88 --> 00:17:02.32 waste belts.
00:17:02.32 --> 00:17:05.68 Success came with surprise in this sort of fighting.
00:17:05.68 --> 00:17:11.20 The enemy must be caught unaware and crushed before they could recover.
00:17:11.20 --> 00:17:17.48 Inevitably we would run short of ammunition if the boat were allowed the chance of standing
00:17:17.48 --> 00:17:19.48 in fighting.
00:17:19.48 --> 00:17:24.88 This weary trudge toward the bridge and our necks along the endless tracks was a crazy
00:17:24.88 --> 00:17:28.08 way to use airborne troops.
00:17:28.08 --> 00:17:30.88 Surprise had been lost long ago.
00:17:30.88 --> 00:17:36.44 Before the operation started, I doubted the wisdom of dropping so far from the bridges.
00:17:36.44 --> 00:17:40.76 Now it was clear that it had been a mistake.
00:17:40.76 --> 00:17:42.80 So they're in a radically different situation.
00:17:42.80 --> 00:17:46.88 Instead of dropping in and holding some ground, now they're moving, they have to carry
00:17:46.88 --> 00:17:49.16 all their gear with them.
00:17:49.16 --> 00:17:53.20 It's not a good situation.
00:17:53.20 --> 00:17:58.000 These talking about some of the guys are carrying it as much as a hundred pounds, which
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.80 is a ton of weight.
00:18:00.80 --> 00:18:04.64 And now they get word from the kernel.
00:18:04.64 --> 00:18:09.12 Back to the book, he was able to confirm that the first parachute brigade was still holding
00:18:09.12 --> 00:18:14.000 out the bridge where the casualties had been heavy on both sides.
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.04 The Germans having already lost two thousand men, although it was not clear who had counted
00:18:19.04 --> 00:18:23.24 them.
00:18:23.24 --> 00:18:27.48 Now as he gets done with that, he kind of gives some word.
00:18:27.48 --> 00:18:30.52 They're going to start moving down this track.
00:18:30.52 --> 00:18:35.88 So he's giving that order to this one of his officers, Doyle.
00:18:35.88 --> 00:18:40.04 Doyle's normally pretty fired up about what he's doing.
00:18:40.04 --> 00:18:41.40 He's a motivated guy.
00:18:41.40 --> 00:18:46.04 Here we go back to the book. Doyle was not at all his embellion self.
00:18:46.04 --> 00:18:48.12 The task of nine platoon was simple.
00:18:48.12 --> 00:18:54.36 He and his men had to walk straight down the track until they ran into the boge position.
00:18:54.36 --> 00:18:59.56 Their first warning of the enemy presence would be the rifle and machine gun fire tearing
00:18:59.56 --> 00:19:01.92 into them.
00:19:01.92 --> 00:19:06.48 Still less were the two scouts to be envied who would be moving out in front of the rest
00:19:06.48 --> 00:19:08.76 of the platoon.
00:19:08.76 --> 00:19:14.60 Who was almost inevitable that the first German rounds would hit one or both of them,
00:19:14.60 --> 00:19:19.16 unless the Germans were cunning enough to let them pass so as to kill more of the men
00:19:19.16 --> 00:19:21.52 behind.
00:19:21.52 --> 00:19:26.72 But without armor in front to draw the enemy fire and pinpoint their positions, there
00:19:26.72 --> 00:19:29.96 was no other way to advance.
00:19:29.96 --> 00:19:36.60 I had chosen Doyle to lead the advance because I was certain that I could rely on him.
00:19:36.60 --> 00:19:41.56 This was the penalty for being good at one's job.
00:19:41.56 --> 00:19:43.48 So there you go.
00:19:43.48 --> 00:19:50.72 They're actually walking down train tracks and they know 100% they know 100% that Germans
00:19:50.72 --> 00:19:54.40 are waiting for them and they're going to push down the strax and the way they're going
00:19:54.40 --> 00:20:02.24 to find the Germans is when the Germans start shooting at them.
00:20:02.24 --> 00:20:09.76 So they proceed down the tracks and now going back to the book, the expected happen.
00:20:09.76 --> 00:20:15.08 The calm of the night collapse in an explosion of light and noise.
00:20:15.08 --> 00:20:20.80 From a wide arc in front of nine platoon, streams of white red and yellow tracer bullets
00:20:20.80 --> 00:20:26.96 converged on the stretch of track where the men must have flung themselves to the ground.
00:20:26.96 --> 00:20:31.76 Every lights and parachute flares larger and brighter than anything carried by a swung down
00:20:31.76 --> 00:20:38.96 towards the earth, lighting the dark country shide to the shade of a gray November morning.
00:20:38.96 --> 00:20:42.16 A house burst into flames on the other side of the railway.
00:20:42.16 --> 00:20:44.32 It was too sudden for an accident.
00:20:44.32 --> 00:20:48.08 The configuration must have been planned.
00:20:48.08 --> 00:20:51.68 Anything which moved was now visible.
00:20:51.68 --> 00:20:54.76 Overall was the noise.
00:20:54.76 --> 00:21:00.16 The den of shells and mortars bursting both behind and ahead, merging with the harsh roar
00:21:00.16 --> 00:21:05.28 of the enemy spanned out light machine guns and the more sustained drumming of the heavier
00:21:05.28 --> 00:21:07.72 weapons.
00:21:07.72 --> 00:21:09.56 Now I could hear another sound.
00:21:09.56 --> 00:21:14.56 It was a slow rata tat of nine platoon's brain guns and the crack of British rifles
00:21:14.56 --> 00:21:26.08 were applying to the German fire.
00:21:26.08 --> 00:21:29.000 This is a well-planned ambush scenario.
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.76 If you think about it, it sounds like they rigged this house to light up and be on fire
00:21:35.76 --> 00:21:41.16 and now that's backlighting and silhoueting all the friendly troops because it just makes
00:21:41.16 --> 00:21:46.64 you stand out because it's a fire behind you on top of that machine gun fire on top of
00:21:46.64 --> 00:21:52.64 that mortars shells are hitting you.
00:21:52.64 --> 00:22:00.84 Here we go back to the book as the major here as the company commander Jeffrey Powell is
00:22:00.84 --> 00:22:04.60 crouch down, waiting as all this is happening out ahead of him.
00:22:04.60 --> 00:22:06.48 He's not with that first platoon.
00:22:06.48 --> 00:22:08.24 He's behind them a little bit.
00:22:08.24 --> 00:22:11.92 Here we go back to the book, I saw a single crouched figure running up the track behind
00:22:11.92 --> 00:22:13.68 towards me.
00:22:13.68 --> 00:22:20.48 Then I recognize the broad bulk of Bartholomew, Leslie Doyle's platoon sergeant.
00:22:20.48 --> 00:22:24.92 This was quick, Leslie had wasted no timing sending back news.
00:22:24.92 --> 00:22:30.68 Only a little out of breath, sergeant Bartholomew sank down by my side and began to speak.
00:22:30.68 --> 00:22:34.04 His voice is calm and sensible as usual.
00:22:34.04 --> 00:22:40.36 His leading section had come under fire at a range of only some 20 or 30 yards.
00:22:40.36 --> 00:22:44.88 It appeared that the Germans had allowed the two scouts to pass unmolested but everyone
00:22:44.88 --> 00:22:48.28 else in the front section had been killed.
00:22:48.28 --> 00:22:52.44 There were several other casualties in the platoon as well including Mr. Doyle who had
00:22:52.44 --> 00:22:56.84 been hit badly in the thigh and was only semi-conscious.
00:22:56.84 --> 00:23:00.32 The survivors were pinned to the ground by fire which was coming from either side of the
00:23:00.32 --> 00:23:03.56 track.
00:23:03.56 --> 00:23:06.000 This was all wrong.
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.60 With his platoon commander hit, sergeant Bartholomew, his place was with the platoon.
00:23:12.60 --> 00:23:16.76 There were plenty of other people to carry messages, not only that but Bartholomew could hardly
00:23:16.76 --> 00:23:21.76 have had time to verify the disastrous information about the leading section.
00:23:21.76 --> 00:23:27.92 It was far from likely that every man in it had been killed.
00:23:27.92 --> 00:23:34.20 So Bartholomew's nerve had broken in the first test.
00:23:34.20 --> 00:23:35.20 That's the situation.
00:23:35.20 --> 00:23:44.80 This guy ran and he comes back and reports in and says, hey everyone's dead and he realizes
00:23:44.80 --> 00:23:49.28 he realizes the company commander realizes that not true.
00:23:49.28 --> 00:23:52.84 Going back to the book perhaps the responsibility had been too much for him.
00:23:52.84 --> 00:23:58.60 However it was he was certainly scared despite his success in concealing the fact.
00:23:58.60 --> 00:24:03.64 The sergeant had run away leaving the platoon to its own devices.
00:24:03.64 --> 00:24:05.44 I was flabbergasted.
00:24:05.44 --> 00:24:12.32 Of all the NCOs I had judged this cool reserved man to be the most dependable.
00:24:12.32 --> 00:24:18.44 A hard taskmaster, too ruthless to be popular, sergeant Bartholomew had been an effective
00:24:18.44 --> 00:24:24.92 foiled to the easy going and friendly doil and the two men had formed a fine team.
00:24:24.92 --> 00:24:29.24 It was incredible that this should have happened.
00:24:29.24 --> 00:24:34.80 In the light of a flare I studied the sergeant's face there was nothing to be seen.
00:24:34.80 --> 00:24:40.04 Bartholomew returned my glaze with steady eyes.
00:24:40.04 --> 00:24:44.92 There could be no point in my further destroying the man's self-respect.
00:24:44.92 --> 00:24:48.40 It was possible that he might recover after this first shock.
00:24:48.40 --> 00:24:53.40 His pride taking charge to control his fear.
00:24:53.40 --> 00:24:58.08 So my review was restrained no more than a comment that Bartholomew should have sent private
00:24:58.08 --> 00:25:02.20 Jones back with the news and not come himself.
00:25:02.20 --> 00:25:06.44 Then I stood up once again, told Robert who had appeared by my side to take charge and
00:25:06.44 --> 00:25:12.68 started down the track toward the forward platoon, motioning Bartholomew to accompany me.
00:25:12.68 --> 00:25:17.60 There was no need to say anything to Harrison, who automatically rose to his feet.
00:25:17.60 --> 00:25:22.20 His stem cradled in his elbow ready to shoot.
00:25:22.20 --> 00:25:25.40 So interesting leadership dynamic there.
00:25:25.40 --> 00:25:28.08 Instead of saying, yo, you coward, you quit.
00:25:28.08 --> 00:25:29.76 He doesn't do that.
00:25:29.76 --> 00:25:34.40 Instead he really tones it back and says he should have said Jones instead.
00:25:34.40 --> 00:25:38.60 He's hoping that this guy will recover and this is a great line.
00:25:38.60 --> 00:25:44.40 It's pride taking charge to control his fear, meaning this guy just has no pride at this
00:25:44.40 --> 00:25:45.40 point.
00:25:45.40 --> 00:25:47.44 He's trying to keep it together.
00:25:47.44 --> 00:25:55.24 But hopefully the company commander is thinking that, okay, this guy will get it back
00:25:55.24 --> 00:25:59.48 together hopefully and will be able to utilize him as opposed to me just dropping the hammer
00:25:59.48 --> 00:26:04.72 on him right now in which case he might just completely break and be worthless.
00:26:04.72 --> 00:26:09.12 The other thing, I tried to include as much as I could of this guy, Harrison, that gets
00:26:09.12 --> 00:26:15.40 mentioned, who's sort of the the the company commander's right hand guy, but he's just
00:26:15.40 --> 00:26:26.16 always there, always ready, always stepping up and making things happen.
00:26:26.16 --> 00:26:32.92 Now eventually, as all that unfolds, we're going back to the book, Nez bit, which is one
00:26:32.92 --> 00:26:34.96 of the guys in that in that platoon.
00:26:34.96 --> 00:26:38.32 Nez bit had decided that it was time to leave and had used the wall to bring back the
00:26:38.32 --> 00:26:40.48 survivors of the platoon.
00:26:40.48 --> 00:26:45.08 Two men were dead while nothing was known of the fate of the two scouts.
00:26:45.08 --> 00:26:51.84 With Nez bit were five wounded men, two of whom including his officer were being carried.
00:26:51.84 --> 00:26:57.32 Leslie and shocking pain from a shattered thigh which Morphe had done little to help had
00:26:57.32 --> 00:27:01.000 fainted after a few yards and was still unconscious.
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.76 A third of the platoon were casualties.
00:27:03.76 --> 00:27:08.84 It was bad, but not as quite as bad as pictured by our following you.
00:27:08.84 --> 00:27:12.84 I could not blame Nez bit for withdrawing without permission.
00:27:12.84 --> 00:27:17.48 Short of ammunition, with their officer wounded and the platoon sergeant unaccountably
00:27:17.48 --> 00:27:21.88 missing, the men had heard nothing of the troops behind them for the past hour and had
00:27:21.88 --> 00:27:26.32 concluded that the battalion must have pulled back.
00:27:26.32 --> 00:27:32.72 Nez bit had seen a lot of war as his DCM one in Crete testified.
00:27:32.72 --> 00:27:34.72 He understood its muddle.
00:27:34.72 --> 00:27:39.20 He knew it was rare for a battle to go as planned.
00:27:39.20 --> 00:27:45.52 His responsibility was to his men to rescue them from what seemed to be a mess.
00:27:45.52 --> 00:27:50.16 This he had done and his judgment had been correct.
00:27:50.16 --> 00:27:56.16 They were no place to be caught at daylight overlooked on a forward slope and unencumbered
00:27:56.16 --> 00:27:57.80 with wounded men.
00:27:57.80 --> 00:28:00.20 You see, decentralized command and action right there.
00:28:00.20 --> 00:28:02.60 Nez bit doesn't hear, doesn't know what's going on.
00:28:02.60 --> 00:28:03.60 He makes a decision.
00:28:03.60 --> 00:28:05.40 I'm getting these guys out of here.
00:28:05.40 --> 00:28:07.44 What's good is the company commander supports?
00:28:07.44 --> 00:28:09.000 Hey, he made a good call.
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.16 That was the right thing to do.
00:28:14.16 --> 00:28:22.44 Now, at this point, they're moving back after they've confirmed, they pushed forward
00:28:22.44 --> 00:28:26.48 trying to find out where the Germans were and now they're moving back because they realize
00:28:26.48 --> 00:28:29.68 that the Germans are absolutely holding strong.
00:28:29.68 --> 00:28:30.68 They've done this push forward.
00:28:30.68 --> 00:28:37.52 They've got basically ambushed and now they pulled back after, like I said, confirming
00:28:37.52 --> 00:28:43.20 where the Germans were back to the book to accomplish this, meaning to accomplish finding
00:28:43.20 --> 00:28:48.36 out where the Germans were to accomplish this had cost us Leslie Doyle and the absent
00:28:48.36 --> 00:28:53.40 Barfall Mill, while two men and Doyle's leading section were dead and the two scouts were
00:28:53.40 --> 00:28:56.92 missing probably either killed or made prisoner.
00:28:56.92 --> 00:29:00.88 Seven other men had been wounded, including another sergeant.
00:29:00.88 --> 00:29:06.72 This is a total of 13 casualties with another nine men lost when we landed.
00:29:06.72 --> 00:29:12.18 With nothing at all accomplished, over 20 men had already been killed or injured and now the
00:29:12.18 --> 00:29:18.98 battalion was moving in the wrong direction back the way we had come.
00:29:18.98 --> 00:29:21.10 You're going to find them.
00:29:21.10 --> 00:29:31.02 What makes this story so devastating is that I talk about Murphy's Law and things go wrong.
00:29:31.02 --> 00:29:32.42 These guys are complete.
00:29:32.42 --> 00:29:36.70 It's just Murphy's Law over and over again.
00:29:36.70 --> 00:29:42.14 Most of the books that we read on here, there's triumph and there's victory at the end.
00:29:42.14 --> 00:29:44.90 And you can see right now already where this is heading.
00:29:44.90 --> 00:29:54.38 We got 20 guys wounded or killed and instead of moving forward, we're actually moving backward.
00:29:54.38 --> 00:29:57.34 Back to the book sooner than expected, we reached the battalion base.
00:29:57.34 --> 00:30:03.06 It had been sighted in an rectangular patch of wood about 20 acres inside lying just north
00:30:03.06 --> 00:30:06.66 of the railway.
00:30:06.66 --> 00:30:12.10 It was 230 AM, a horrible hour, especially so if one is time.
00:30:12.10 --> 00:30:15.10 I heard cold and hungry.
00:30:15.10 --> 00:30:19.38 Thank God it would be starting to get light in a couple of hours.
00:30:19.38 --> 00:30:22.26 What would happen tomorrow?
00:30:22.26 --> 00:30:25.70 Something had gone very wrong indeed.
00:30:25.70 --> 00:30:30.62 By now we should be dug in on the high ground north of our NEM, waiting for the Germans
00:30:30.62 --> 00:30:33.82 to counter attack the bridges instead.
00:30:33.82 --> 00:30:38.14 We were sitting here in the woods only a few miles from where we had dropped with strong
00:30:38.14 --> 00:30:43.02 enemy forces between ourselves and the city where the men of first brigade must be fighting
00:30:43.02 --> 00:30:45.86 for their lives.
00:30:45.86 --> 00:30:50.62 Wherever one turned they're seem to be German troops and good ones at that.
00:30:50.62 --> 00:30:55.30 The men who had stopped us had not behaved like rear area troops scraped together to put
00:30:55.30 --> 00:31:01.34 up some sort of resistance, but it fought with skill and tenacity.
00:31:01.34 --> 00:31:05.66 The slit trenches were dug and everyone except for the double centuries in each section
00:31:05.66 --> 00:31:09.98 and the officers and NCOs on duty was sound asleep.
00:31:09.98 --> 00:31:15.34 The men humped like dogs, some curled up with a companion for warmth, lying in their full
00:31:15.34 --> 00:31:20.46 equipment, their weapons tied to their wrists by the slings.
00:31:20.46 --> 00:31:22.58 I should be asleep too.
00:31:22.58 --> 00:31:27.74 Not sitting and worrying, feeling sorry for myself, but trying to get some rest and preparation
00:31:27.74 --> 00:31:31.42 for the coming day.
00:31:31.42 --> 00:31:37.70 Then to would be at 0, 4, 30 hours, half an hour before first light, when everyone would
00:31:37.70 --> 00:31:48.02 be awake and ready in this slit weapon poised for a possible dawn attack.
00:31:48.02 --> 00:31:54.78 So they're dug in and of course it's not looking good at this point.
00:31:54.78 --> 00:31:57.62 They're going to stand to it 0, 4, 30 which is pretty common.
00:31:57.62 --> 00:32:05.58 You're going to be up before the sun rise and you want to be up before the enemy as well.
00:32:05.58 --> 00:32:08.02 Now they get together and get some word.
00:32:08.02 --> 00:32:09.02 Here we go back to the book.
00:32:09.02 --> 00:32:10.22 It did not take long.
00:32:10.22 --> 00:32:13.06 It did not take the kernel long to give us our orders.
00:32:13.06 --> 00:32:16.82 The brigade was to renew its effort to reach the bridge and bring relief to the men still
00:32:16.82 --> 00:32:17.82 fighting there.
00:32:17.82 --> 00:32:24.58 So pretty simple straight forward goal.
00:32:24.58 --> 00:32:30.74 And in order to achieve this goal, they set up to do an attack on this little section
00:32:30.74 --> 00:32:34.30 of woods where they think there's a bunch of Germans and here we go back to the book.
00:32:34.30 --> 00:32:38.54 The leading sections plunged into the wood and disappeared.
00:32:38.54 --> 00:32:41.10 There were no enemy there at all.
00:32:41.10 --> 00:32:43.34 The information from brigade must have been wrong.
00:32:43.34 --> 00:32:47.34 We had attacked and taken an empty position.
00:32:47.34 --> 00:32:52.58 Never was there such an anti-climax, but never was an anti-climax.
00:32:52.58 --> 00:33:00.90 Now we get a little visit up on the front lines.
00:33:00.90 --> 00:33:02.06 Here we go back to the book.
00:33:02.06 --> 00:33:06.94 As the small spare figure stepped out of the first vehicle, I realized that it was the
00:33:06.94 --> 00:33:11.14 first time I had seen the Brigadier commander since we left England.
00:33:11.14 --> 00:33:15.14 He was just the same as ever, relaxed and smiling.
00:33:15.14 --> 00:33:17.02 Battle was nothing new to him.
00:33:17.02 --> 00:33:20.34 He had been through the worst of the desert war.
00:33:20.34 --> 00:33:25.02 Battle in no way disconcerted him at least not outwardly.
00:33:25.02 --> 00:33:28.02 It's interesting he uses the term model.
00:33:28.02 --> 00:33:29.42 He's talking about the fog of war.
00:33:29.42 --> 00:33:32.74 This model, when you don't really know what's happening, he talks about how the veterans
00:33:32.74 --> 00:33:36.86 are used to it and accustomed to it and they can deal with it.
00:33:36.86 --> 00:33:40.06 Model in no way disconcerted him at least not outwardly.
00:33:40.06 --> 00:33:47.14 He seemed to anticipate it, understanding how judgment and behavior was impaired by danger.
00:33:47.14 --> 00:33:52.74 Wherever he went, he inspired confidence with his gentle eyes in friendly manner.
00:33:52.74 --> 00:33:56.82 For regular cavalry officer, his background was unusual.
00:33:56.82 --> 00:34:02.82 He'd come to his regiment not from sandhurst, but from Oxford, with a double first and
00:34:02.82 --> 00:34:06.42 fluency in a half a dozen languages.
00:34:06.42 --> 00:34:07.90 And I love this line right here.
00:34:07.90 --> 00:34:13.66 He wore his learning light-need lightly as he did his decorations.
00:34:13.66 --> 00:34:18.62 This guy is highly educated and highly decorated, but you don't even know it.
00:34:18.62 --> 00:34:22.70 It was rare for soldiers to be aware of officers more senior than the kernels who commanded
00:34:22.70 --> 00:34:24.02 their battalions.
00:34:24.02 --> 00:34:29.46 But every man in the brigade would recognize, could recognize and name the brigadier.
00:34:29.46 --> 00:34:33.26 The two visitors did not stay long, but their appearance was atomic for all.
00:34:33.26 --> 00:34:40.10 It was a reminder that there were able men in charge, even though the battle was developing
00:34:40.10 --> 00:34:46.70 in a rather odd manner.
00:34:46.70 --> 00:34:53.90 Now as he continues in these situations, back to the book, suddenly my preoccupation, my
00:34:53.90 --> 00:34:57.22 preoccupation with the problems of others ceased.
00:34:57.22 --> 00:35:02.46 There was a familiar wine overhead, and I found myself propelled into the half-dog trench,
00:35:02.46 --> 00:35:05.78 all but on top of gall-braith and robber.
00:35:05.78 --> 00:35:07.46 The action had been a reflex.
00:35:07.46 --> 00:35:11.14 I knew that I had made no conscious decision to jump.
00:35:11.14 --> 00:35:15.86 As I lay there with my second in commands and trenching tool, carving into a ridge in my
00:35:15.86 --> 00:35:20.86 left buttock, the mortar bomb burst about eight feet to the right.
00:35:20.86 --> 00:35:25.98 The scream of the shards of jagged metal passing just overhead flailed my ears as earth
00:35:25.98 --> 00:35:29.54 and stones spattered down on top of us.
00:35:29.54 --> 00:35:34.18 The stench of high explosive filled my field the trench.
00:35:34.18 --> 00:35:38.40 My face I found was pressed into the coarse material of corporal gall-braith's battle
00:35:38.40 --> 00:35:40.10 trousers.
00:35:40.10 --> 00:35:43.90 Gingerly raising my head I peered over the low parapet.
00:35:43.90 --> 00:35:49.10 At the foot of the of a tree some 15 yards away lay a motionless heap, a green and
00:35:49.10 --> 00:35:53.34 khaki bundle which did not stir.
00:35:53.34 --> 00:35:57.82 Jumping out of the trench I ran across and turned over the limp body.
00:35:57.82 --> 00:36:02.62 The head fell back to show the open staring eyes of sergeant Hawks, one of the seven
00:36:02.62 --> 00:36:08.14 platoon section commanders, a bright young A.N.C.O. only just promoted who'd been with the
00:36:08.14 --> 00:36:12.22 battalion since the day it was raised.
00:36:12.22 --> 00:36:14.70 He was another old friend.
00:36:14.70 --> 00:36:19.86 At first I could see no sign of injury but then I noticed the small hole in the back of Hawks
00:36:19.86 --> 00:36:25.90 helmet and the thin stream of blood streaking the back of his neck.
00:36:25.90 --> 00:36:30.86 Lying by hugging side I seemed to count seven explosions all just a little further away
00:36:30.86 --> 00:36:35.54 than the first but still close enough to smell the hot gases.
00:36:35.54 --> 00:36:40.74 There was a short pause and then as if it were not afterthought an eighth bomb struck the branches
00:36:40.74 --> 00:36:46.58 of the tree just above us directing its hot metal splinters down to the trenches below.
00:36:46.58 --> 00:36:51.28 A half strangled, his cry of distress brought my head up just in time to see corporal
00:36:51.28 --> 00:36:56.26 preacher clamber out of his slit and reach across the towards the cry.
00:36:56.26 --> 00:37:01.78 His haversac of medical supplies marked with its red cross dangling from his hand.
00:37:01.78 --> 00:37:04.50 The pause lasted no more than a half a minute.
00:37:04.50 --> 00:37:05.50 Again the wine.
00:37:05.50 --> 00:37:06.74 Again I ducked.
00:37:06.74 --> 00:37:11.90 This was the covering fire for a counter attack or the was this the covering fire for
00:37:11.90 --> 00:37:17.26 a counter attack or were the boge merely harassing us spitefully.
00:37:17.26 --> 00:37:21.54 But when I raised my head from Higgins from Higgins boots to look around I was relieved
00:37:21.54 --> 00:37:26.18 to see one of the seven platoon brain gunners his helmet and eyes just above the level of
00:37:26.18 --> 00:37:30.58 the parapet gazing down the track towards his front.
00:37:30.58 --> 00:37:33.30 So the centuries were still doing their job.
00:37:33.30 --> 00:37:36.18 The fire was not forcing their heads down.
00:37:36.18 --> 00:37:44.06 If this was the covering fire for an attack we would not be caught on a wares.
00:37:44.06 --> 00:37:48.34 So that's the standard procedure right here for the Germans and really for anyone.
00:37:48.34 --> 00:37:49.54 It's covering move right.
00:37:49.54 --> 00:37:53.62 We put in big bonds we put in mortars we put our in artillery and while you're hiding
00:37:53.62 --> 00:37:58.58 and while you're ducking down so you don't get killed they maneuver in and then right
00:37:58.58 --> 00:38:03.58 it right when they get so close that they're in danger of their own artillery the artillery
00:38:03.58 --> 00:38:06.66 stops and then they proceed with the assault.
00:38:06.66 --> 00:38:07.66 Here we go.
00:38:07.66 --> 00:38:11.42 The low now there's a low the low provided a chance to finish digging.
00:38:11.42 --> 00:38:15.74 There was no longer any need to persuade the men to dig faster the lesson had really been
00:38:15.74 --> 00:38:17.06 driven home.
00:38:17.06 --> 00:38:20.74 We've been digging for no more than a few minutes when the sound of firing to the north
00:38:20.74 --> 00:38:26.30 slack and but the noise from the vehicles in front had increased the thought of guns
00:38:26.30 --> 00:38:31.74 only a few hundred yards away was punctuated by the hammering of brands.
00:38:31.74 --> 00:38:35.50 By the way, brands I don't think I've said this brands are sort of the weapon of British
00:38:35.50 --> 00:38:42.10 machine gun versus the the spanned out which is which is the German machine guns and
00:38:42.10 --> 00:38:48.58 the use the the brits in the Americans use the term spanned out to talk about basically
00:38:48.58 --> 00:38:54.22 heavy machine heavy your machine guns but but that's what they're talking about when
00:38:54.22 --> 00:38:59.50 they're talking about spanned out and then a brand is the Brit machine gun.
00:38:59.50 --> 00:39:05.62 Both Ford Patoons were in action and I had placed company headquarters too far back
00:39:05.62 --> 00:39:08.82 to be able to see what was happening.
00:39:08.82 --> 00:39:13.38 The walkie talkies were silent also I worried about the sitting of the cartoon some
00:39:13.38 --> 00:39:19.74 300 yards apart each isolated in its own corner of the woods and unable to support the
00:39:19.74 --> 00:39:23.14 others against a determined attack.
00:39:23.14 --> 00:39:29.42 This is so important for tactical leaders out there think about these lessons and these are
00:39:29.42 --> 00:39:33.50 lessons that I talk about all the time and these are lessons that I used to have to teach
00:39:33.50 --> 00:39:34.70 all the time.
00:39:34.70 --> 00:39:38.34 So you've got your platoon's they're out there doing something.
00:39:38.34 --> 00:39:42.02 You need to be close enough that you have communications with them so that you actually
00:39:42.02 --> 00:39:44.62 understand what's happening and this is the same in the business work.
00:39:44.62 --> 00:39:48.38 If you put yourself in a position where you can't I will you don't understand what's
00:39:48.38 --> 00:39:52.22 happening in the field then you're not going to be able to help you're not going to
00:39:52.22 --> 00:39:56.14 be able to support you're not going to be able to to understand what's happening so you
00:39:56.14 --> 00:39:57.86 can make decisions.
00:39:57.86 --> 00:40:01.90 So in this point he's positioned himself too far away.
00:40:01.90 --> 00:40:08.66 On top of that he's positioned his platoon's too far apart from each other.
00:40:08.66 --> 00:40:13.06 So if you're too far apart from each other you can't cover for each other if you can't
00:40:13.06 --> 00:40:17.38 cover you can't move and if you can't move you can't win.
00:40:17.38 --> 00:40:20.70 So those are critical points.
00:40:20.70 --> 00:40:25.66 Make sure your command position is close enough not so close that you're getting in the
00:40:25.66 --> 00:40:29.70 fire fight note not so close that you're pin down but close enough so that you understand
00:40:29.70 --> 00:40:31.30 what is happening.
00:40:31.30 --> 00:40:35.74 And then if you have multiple elements in the field you get them close enough to each
00:40:35.74 --> 00:40:39.58 other that they can support each other.
00:40:39.58 --> 00:40:43.74 Always.
00:40:43.74 --> 00:40:47.14 He sees a guy running back and here we go back to the book it was Sergeant Prior one
00:40:47.14 --> 00:40:51.30 of Nezbitt's section commanders a rather sulky man able and well educated but with a
00:40:51.30 --> 00:40:52.58 grudge against authority.
00:40:52.58 --> 00:40:58.10 And his left hand prior grasp is stend in a grip so firm that the knuckle is showed
00:40:58.10 --> 00:41:00.78 blue under the sunburn.
00:41:00.78 --> 00:41:05.22 His right arm from which clothing had been cut away at the shoulder was thrust into the
00:41:05.22 --> 00:41:06.82 front of his smock.
00:41:06.82 --> 00:41:10.50 The elbow covered by a bloodstained dressing.
00:41:10.50 --> 00:41:14.38 His face was white with shock and taught with pain.
00:41:14.38 --> 00:41:21.22 A morphe injection was doing little to alleviate the agony of an elbow smashed by a bullet.
00:41:21.22 --> 00:41:23.98 The news prior brought was serious.
00:41:23.98 --> 00:41:28.02 The vehicles which we could hear were booch armor.
00:41:28.02 --> 00:41:33.18 Moving backwards and forward along the road and sweeping the front of nine platoon's position
00:41:33.18 --> 00:41:36.58 secure from retaliation.
00:41:36.58 --> 00:41:41.14 So far the armor had only claimed prior but Sergeant Avondale had been killed by a
00:41:41.14 --> 00:41:46.46 mortar fragment as he dashed across between a couple of trees to put some question to
00:41:46.46 --> 00:41:48.70 Nezbitt.
00:41:48.70 --> 00:41:53.10 This inexorable loss of skilled leaders was serious.
00:41:53.10 --> 00:41:58.30 In our parachute battalions unlike usual infantry units, section leaders ranked as sergeants
00:41:58.30 --> 00:42:00.30 not corpals.
00:42:00.30 --> 00:42:07.10 Nine platoon had now lost not only its officer but three of its four sergeants as well.
00:42:07.10 --> 00:42:11.34 Hawks was dead and one of seven platoon's section commanders had failed to appear at the
00:42:11.34 --> 00:42:14.14 rendezvous after the drop.
00:42:14.14 --> 00:42:25.94 Already nearly half the sergeants had become casualties.
00:42:25.94 --> 00:42:33.10 This is just a nightmare unfolding.
00:42:33.10 --> 00:42:37.50 Back to the book after we'd put the final touches on our slit trenches, time was found
00:42:37.50 --> 00:42:41.66 to scrape a shallow grave for sergeant Hawks.
00:42:41.66 --> 00:42:45.50 It was hard to suppress one's revoltsh in touching the body of someone I had known so
00:42:45.50 --> 00:42:51.06 well but just as I was stealing myself to do so, Huggin stepped forward, ripped open the
00:42:51.06 --> 00:42:56.58 dead man's smock and shirt and slipped one of the two identity discs over the blood
00:42:56.58 --> 00:42:59.22 stained head.
00:42:59.22 --> 00:43:03.10 The sergeant major then unbuckled his watch and searched the pockets for anything which
00:43:03.10 --> 00:43:09.02 might be useful, a morphiest syringe and a field dressing, a bar of chocolate and a couple
00:43:09.02 --> 00:43:14.54 of mills grenades, two packets of cigarettes and a box of matches, a couple of maps and
00:43:14.54 --> 00:43:16.82 a pocket knife.
00:43:16.82 --> 00:43:21.18 There was nothing personal except for a grubby envelope containing a half a dozen faded
00:43:21.18 --> 00:43:27.78 and dog-yared snapshots of the stout smiling girl holding a baby.
00:43:27.78 --> 00:43:32.06 Before buttoning the envelope into his breast pocket, Huggin slipped the identity disc
00:43:32.06 --> 00:43:35.14 between the photographs.
00:43:35.14 --> 00:43:39.58 I was helping Corporal Prychard shoveled the earth back over Hawks' body, listening with
00:43:39.58 --> 00:43:44.06 one ear to Huggin, sharing the dead man's ammunition and other possessions among the members
00:43:44.06 --> 00:43:45.70 of the company headquarters.
00:43:45.70 --> 00:43:51.38 When suddenly I became aware of Jimmy Gray standing beside me apparently anxious to speak
00:43:51.38 --> 00:43:55.38 but different, at interrupting.
00:43:55.38 --> 00:43:59.58 Telling Prychard to finish the job, I rose from my knees, glad to be able to put my mind
00:43:59.58 --> 00:44:02.66 to something else.
00:44:02.66 --> 00:44:07.62 When I turned to speak to Gray, I was disturbed by what I saw.
00:44:07.62 --> 00:44:12.74 The dirt of battle had exaggerated his usual scruffiness.
00:44:12.74 --> 00:44:17.30 His smock and trousers were coated with mud and dust and his right sleeve was stained
00:44:17.30 --> 00:44:19.74 from top to bottom with blood.
00:44:19.74 --> 00:44:24.54 Not his own, as he explained when he saw my eyes fixed on it.
00:44:24.54 --> 00:44:29.46 The front of his smock and the battle dress under it, neath had been torn by a large fragment
00:44:29.46 --> 00:44:31.38 of a mortar bomb.
00:44:31.38 --> 00:44:35.90 He had reached in some miraculous fashion and failed to even scratch him.
00:44:35.90 --> 00:44:41.98 Three inches to one side and it would have been set and it would have severed his head.
00:44:41.98 --> 00:44:48.38 But it was the eyes above the pallid unshaving cheeks which were frightening.
00:44:48.38 --> 00:44:51.14 They were empty of life.
00:44:51.14 --> 00:44:58.26 When he spoke, the words were loosed and well-chosen as ever, but the voice lacked expression.
00:44:58.26 --> 00:45:00.58 The phrases were cold.
00:45:00.58 --> 00:45:04.86 He was not as if he were describing events which he had himself witnessed, but something
00:45:04.86 --> 00:45:09.38 unreal, something half imagined.
00:45:09.38 --> 00:45:13.46 Be companyated attacked at 0800 hours.
00:45:13.46 --> 00:45:17.50 At the start, their advance through the woods had gone like the first attack of the morning
00:45:17.50 --> 00:45:22.90 a calm and steady progress against a seemingly non-existent enemy.
00:45:22.90 --> 00:45:27.62 Then some hundred yards short of the objective, a swath of fire had cut down the men
00:45:27.62 --> 00:45:30.10 of the two leading pletoons.
00:45:30.10 --> 00:45:35.42 The half-grown trees and the sparse undergrowth had neither hidden them nor shielded them
00:45:35.42 --> 00:45:42.58 from the inner locking arcs of the enemy weapons which covered every inch of ground.
00:45:42.58 --> 00:45:47.30 It was just possible that they might have been able to deal with the machine guns alone,
00:45:47.30 --> 00:45:49.86 but the armor was too much for them.
00:45:49.86 --> 00:45:55.62 Pumping shells into the men at near point blank range.
00:45:55.62 --> 00:45:58.34 Gray had seen it all happen.
00:45:58.34 --> 00:46:02.50 The Colonel had tried to stop the attack as soon as the full strength of the enemy position
00:46:02.50 --> 00:46:08.02 had become clear, but by then more than half the men of the two leading pletoons had
00:46:08.02 --> 00:46:11.50 been killed or wounded.
00:46:11.50 --> 00:46:13.86 Both sub-alterns were dead.
00:46:13.86 --> 00:46:20.50 The other officers and the CSM had all been wounded.
00:46:20.50 --> 00:46:25.62 The Colonel had tried to turn the German flank by sending a company around to the left,
00:46:25.62 --> 00:46:27.86 but there was no flank.
00:46:27.86 --> 00:46:31.38 The second attack had been a replica of the first.
00:46:31.38 --> 00:46:36.94 It too had collapsed, but not before some 40 more men were dead or maimed, including
00:46:36.94 --> 00:46:41.54 two of the four surviving officers.
00:46:41.54 --> 00:46:48.74 Harry Bates had been terribly wounded in the stomach and by now was probably dead.
00:46:48.74 --> 00:46:55.90 As Gray had pulled him behind some cover, his blood had soaked his sleeve.
00:46:55.90 --> 00:46:57.98 This was not the complete story.
00:46:57.98 --> 00:47:00.74 There was further bad news.
00:47:00.74 --> 00:47:05.38 Not only had our own attack been shattered, but the other battalion to our north had
00:47:05.38 --> 00:47:11.82 hit similar enemy positions and was making little progress in its efforts to get into
00:47:11.82 --> 00:47:15.66 our name along the main road.
00:47:15.66 --> 00:47:20.46 From somewhere or other, the boat should found enough troops of quality good enough to
00:47:20.46 --> 00:47:29.70 smash the brigade's attempt to reach the city.
00:47:29.70 --> 00:47:39.58 So we deserve a horrible situation unfolding.
00:47:39.58 --> 00:47:45.02 Back to the book, from far away in the distance came the drum of powerful airplane engines.
00:47:45.02 --> 00:47:50.38 As it was the first to spot the minute shapes, first circling and then diving out of the sun
00:47:50.38 --> 00:47:55.98 towards us, the noise changing to a shriek as the machine swept down towards the wood towards
00:47:55.98 --> 00:47:57.94 the woods.
00:47:57.94 --> 00:48:03.98 From a half a dozen different directions, a happy shout of spit fires rose from the trenches.
00:48:03.98 --> 00:48:07.10 At last some help had arrived from the outside world.
00:48:07.10 --> 00:48:11.30 The RAF had arrived to give us closer support.
00:48:11.30 --> 00:48:17.66 And that's, you know, we've had closer support saved the day many times in books that
00:48:17.66 --> 00:48:21.46 we've talked about on this podcast.
00:48:21.46 --> 00:48:26.10 As I gave up at the dozen spit screaming down to strafe the boat's positions on the
00:48:26.10 --> 00:48:31.82 sloping ridge head, Nesbitz voiced suddenly roared in my ear, shouting to everyone to
00:48:31.82 --> 00:48:35.66 get their heads down and hide their faces.
00:48:35.66 --> 00:48:41.10 As I ducked with the rest, I spotted the black crosses on the wings.
00:48:41.10 --> 00:48:45.94 The aircraft were not ours, but German mesher schmits.
00:48:45.94 --> 00:48:51.22 Our air superiority was so overwhelming that it never occurred to anyone that the machines
00:48:51.22 --> 00:48:54.06 might be hostile.
00:48:54.06 --> 00:49:00.78 They were not diving onto the enemy positions, but on to our own.
00:49:00.78 --> 00:49:06.90 I gazed, skywards, the mesher schmits was so close that I could see the pilots face.
00:49:06.90 --> 00:49:11.14 Two rockets detached themselves from the wings and swooped down to explode seconds later
00:49:11.14 --> 00:49:17.78 in the woods where the survivors of A and B companies were settling into their new positions.
00:49:17.78 --> 00:49:21.94 As I ducked once more, there was another scream of engines from behind, followed by the
00:49:21.94 --> 00:49:26.90 sound of a storm of bullets striking branches on the trees and the other side.
00:49:26.90 --> 00:49:32.02 Two aircraft which had discharged their rockets were now carrying out a second run strafing
00:49:32.02 --> 00:49:34.34 with their machine guns.
00:49:34.34 --> 00:49:38.78 As I squeezed even closer to the earth at the bottom of the shallow trench, the reverberations
00:49:38.78 --> 00:49:43.10 of an explosion, some 50 yards of waves, pounded my ear drums.
00:49:43.10 --> 00:49:46.18 It was another rocket.
00:49:46.18 --> 00:49:48.74 Suddenly it ended.
00:49:48.74 --> 00:49:54.86 The aircraft had vanished as quickly as they had arrived.
00:49:54.86 --> 00:49:55.86 Wow.
00:49:55.86 --> 00:50:01.66 Yeah, because at this point, the British and the Americans had almost total air domination,
00:50:01.66 --> 00:50:05.98 so everyone just completely assumed that of thank God here comes some Spitfires to
00:50:05.98 --> 00:50:13.26 come and save us and they were wrong.
00:50:13.26 --> 00:50:21.22 Now the air, we did have air domination for the most part and one of the things that they
00:50:21.22 --> 00:50:26.46 needed as you heard these airborne troops, they can only carry so much and so they're
00:50:26.46 --> 00:50:27.78 going to need resupplies.
00:50:27.78 --> 00:50:28.78 They need more ammunition.
00:50:28.78 --> 00:50:29.78 They need medical gear.
00:50:29.78 --> 00:50:31.02 They need water.
00:50:31.02 --> 00:50:33.78 They need stuff to be dropped to them.
00:50:33.78 --> 00:50:41.22 And so there was a plan in place for them to have gear and food and equipment and ammunition
00:50:41.22 --> 00:50:47.06 dropped to them at these locations where they were supposed to be.
00:50:47.06 --> 00:50:49.38 Because remember they were supposed to be making progress this whole time.
00:50:49.38 --> 00:50:52.54 They're not making progress, but they're supposed to be making progress.
00:50:52.54 --> 00:50:57.50 And since communication is so bad, they can't call back and say, hey, we're not we're
00:50:57.50 --> 00:51:02.46 supposed to be we're over here, drop the gear on us.
00:51:02.46 --> 00:51:10.50 But the gear gets dropped in the pre planned positions, which of course are enemy positions.
00:51:10.50 --> 00:51:15.10 But here's what it sounds like for them, or here's what they're thinking on the ground.
00:51:15.10 --> 00:51:18.78 Then to the south of us, I saw the familiar shape of a line of Dakota's approaching at about
00:51:18.78 --> 00:51:20.26 a thousand feet in a minute.
00:51:20.26 --> 00:51:22.74 The sky was crammed with them.
00:51:22.74 --> 00:51:27.78 Who's the first supply drop about which we had been told that the briefings, but the
00:51:27.78 --> 00:51:32.82 drop zone is a couple miles away over the other side of the hill right in the middle of
00:51:32.82 --> 00:51:35.30 enemy positions.
00:51:35.30 --> 00:51:39.78 By now, of course, the division should have captured the area, but the boat still held
00:51:39.78 --> 00:51:41.78 it.
00:51:41.78 --> 00:51:45.62 News of the progress of the battle could not have reached the RAF where the pilots would
00:51:45.62 --> 00:51:51.18 have diverted to drop their supplies elsewhere.
00:51:51.18 --> 00:51:55.62 Now, they can see this happening.
00:51:55.62 --> 00:52:02.86 And the people that are in the planes, they're called the RASC, the Royal Army Service
00:52:02.86 --> 00:52:03.86 Corps.
00:52:03.86 --> 00:52:11.18 They run basically the supply and the logistics and help re-supply and drop this equipment.
00:52:11.18 --> 00:52:17.10 So this is, he's as he's watching all these Dakotas, the Dakotas are these little transport
00:52:17.10 --> 00:52:18.10 planes.
00:52:18.10 --> 00:52:24.02 They had parachuted out of and now they're watching them drop this resupply.
00:52:24.02 --> 00:52:30.18 Back to the book, among the mass, a single Dakota just overhead caught my attention.
00:52:30.18 --> 00:52:35.38 It had already been hit and flames were creeping down from the starboard engine toward the
00:52:35.38 --> 00:52:37.78 cockpit.
00:52:37.78 --> 00:52:45.46 As it lost height, the khaki-clad RASC dispatchers were standing at the open doorway, pushing
00:52:45.46 --> 00:52:50.70 out the paniers of supplies, those of the bags of supplies.
00:52:50.70 --> 00:52:53.46 I could see their faces.
00:52:53.46 --> 00:52:59.86 The fire was on their side of the plane, the wing was burning before their eyes.
00:52:59.86 --> 00:53:04.02 The Dakotas was now little more than 300 feet above the ground.
00:53:04.02 --> 00:53:08.90 If the men at the door jump now, they might just save themselves.
00:53:08.90 --> 00:53:13.70 In a second or two more, the aircraft would be so low that their parachutes would not
00:53:13.70 --> 00:53:17.38 have time to open.
00:53:17.38 --> 00:53:23.86 This the men must have known, but they went on with their routine drill, pushing out the
00:53:23.86 --> 00:53:29.22 paniers regardless of what would happen to them.
00:53:29.22 --> 00:53:31.98 Then the starboard wing crumpled.
00:53:31.98 --> 00:53:39.94 The flaming plane disappeared beyond the trees, the paniers still falling from the open door.
00:53:39.94 --> 00:53:42.70 The sky was empty.
00:53:42.70 --> 00:53:49.70 The last plane had gone, but we still stood watching the place where the Dakotas had vanished,
00:53:49.70 --> 00:54:01.06 mourning the futility of the self-sacrifice we had just witnessed.
00:54:01.06 --> 00:54:07.34 Can't even imagine that.
00:54:07.34 --> 00:54:15.78 The sky is just continuing to do their job, knowing their fate.
00:54:15.78 --> 00:54:23.50 At their senior officers at this point, and their NCOs are starting to get hit pretty
00:54:23.50 --> 00:54:27.34 regular to be by snipers.
00:54:27.34 --> 00:54:34.54 So he decides to tell us his guys, hey, take your rank off your uniform, because I don't
00:54:34.54 --> 00:54:41.02 want the enemy to know, and he tells us to one of his leaders name Robert.
00:54:41.02 --> 00:54:45.56 And he says, as I watched, Robert slipped his captain stars off his shoulders and tucked
00:54:45.56 --> 00:54:47.30 them away in his pocket.
00:54:47.30 --> 00:54:53.94 I knew for certain that my second in command disapproved officers should show themselves
00:54:53.94 --> 00:54:55.74 as such.
00:54:55.74 --> 00:54:59.46 So one of his guys is thinking, no, we're officers.
00:54:59.46 --> 00:55:05.98 We need to stand out.
00:55:05.98 --> 00:55:15.26 I mentioned the American forces, the 80s, and the British forces, there was also a Polish
00:55:15.26 --> 00:55:20.46 parachute brigade that was coming in on this attack as well.
00:55:20.46 --> 00:55:25.82 And they were scheduled to come in a little bit later as reinforcements.
00:55:25.82 --> 00:55:27.70 And here we go, back to the Beckl book.
00:55:27.70 --> 00:55:31.54 Only then did I remember that the glider-born part of the Polish parachute brigade was
00:55:31.54 --> 00:55:36.38 due to land that afternoon upon the stretch of enemy, upon the stretch of open country
00:55:36.38 --> 00:55:41.70 below us, at the same time as the parachute battalions were dropped in the Polterland, south
00:55:41.70 --> 00:55:44.06 of Arnheim bridges.
00:55:44.06 --> 00:55:48.70 The landing zone was already a battlefield, and the wretched poles were about to land in the
00:55:48.70 --> 00:55:50.98 middle of it.
00:55:50.98 --> 00:55:52.70 First the gliders hit the ground.
00:55:52.70 --> 00:55:57.46 This massive weight tearing up chunks of stubbles that skated to a halt, lurking onto one
00:55:57.46 --> 00:55:59.06 wing as it did so.
00:55:59.06 --> 00:56:03.26 Men jumped out and rushed to the rear and released the tail unit so that the vehicles
00:56:03.26 --> 00:56:05.54 inside could be driven out.
00:56:05.54 --> 00:56:08.22 Two more gliders were now plowing across the ground.
00:56:08.22 --> 00:56:11.94 Another exploded in the air and a vast ball of yellow flame just as it was upon the
00:56:11.94 --> 00:56:13.98 point of touching down.
00:56:13.98 --> 00:56:18.38 Mortar bombs were bursting among the men struggling to release their loads while streams of
00:56:18.38 --> 00:56:23.42 chased tracer bysected the scene into oddly formal patterns.
00:56:23.42 --> 00:56:29.18 Another glider was on fire on the ground as still more swooped into land, adding to the
00:56:29.18 --> 00:56:30.90 chaos.
00:56:30.90 --> 00:56:35.66 The poles were now joining in the battle themselves, some firing toward the Germans,
00:56:35.66 --> 00:56:40.30 some towards the KOSB, which is a, the King's own Scottish borders.
00:56:40.30 --> 00:56:43.26 It's another British unit.
00:56:43.26 --> 00:56:47.82 This is some in the direction of our other battalion.
00:56:47.82 --> 00:56:51.18 It must be impossible for the poles to distinguish enemy from friend.
00:56:51.18 --> 00:56:55.74 They probably thought they had landed in a circle of both units all intent upon their
00:56:55.74 --> 00:56:57.74 destruction.
00:56:57.74 --> 00:57:01.70 In a few minutes it was all over, from the wrecked and flaming gliders which now littered
00:57:01.70 --> 00:57:06.42 the ground, small parties of poles were making their escape firing at anything they saw
00:57:06.42 --> 00:57:07.82 move.
00:57:07.82 --> 00:57:11.30 Two or three vehicles have been driven away but otherwise they had failed to drag their
00:57:11.30 --> 00:57:13.82 jeeps and guns from the gliders.
00:57:13.82 --> 00:57:18.54 The Polish anti-tank battery no longer existed as a fighting unit.
00:57:18.54 --> 00:57:24.30 It landed in the middle of a battle and been destroyed before it could fire a single shot.
00:57:24.30 --> 00:57:25.54 Waste!
00:57:25.54 --> 00:57:32.14 It was waste once again, waste like the supply drop, nothing seemed to go right.
00:57:32.14 --> 00:57:37.26 A knot of some eight poles charged towards us intent on seeking shelter either in the woods
00:57:37.26 --> 00:57:40.82 or behind the safety of a railway embankment.
00:57:40.82 --> 00:57:44.90 On thirty yards away one man slightly ahead of the other's must have noticed our camouflage
00:57:44.90 --> 00:57:49.90 steel helmets in the slit trenches ahead and shouted a warning.
00:57:49.90 --> 00:57:53.38 In a bunch they flung themselves into the undergrowth.
00:57:53.38 --> 00:57:57.18 Anticipating what would happen, I yelled to everyone to get their heads down just as a
00:57:57.18 --> 00:58:01.50 hail of bullets from the poles whistle over our heads, a few hitting the trench pair of
00:58:01.50 --> 00:58:05.66 pits but most striking the trees well above our heads as the excited men emptied their
00:58:05.66 --> 00:58:08.02 weapons in our direction.
00:58:08.02 --> 00:58:11.90 So long as we kept our heads down we were safe from the Polish fire but the worry was that
00:58:11.90 --> 00:58:17.34 some of them might creep closer and start to fling grenades around.
00:58:17.34 --> 00:58:22.14 However in a couple of minutes the firing slackened and then ceased.
00:58:22.14 --> 00:58:26.94 Possibly the poles since that something might be wrong when no one retaliated.
00:58:26.94 --> 00:58:30.88 The comparative silence provided the opportunity to shout a warning across the narrow
00:58:30.88 --> 00:58:34.10 stretch of ground which separated us.
00:58:34.10 --> 00:58:38.62 The crew is no reply and I shouted once again in faltering English a voice inquired
00:58:38.62 --> 00:58:40.98 who we were.
00:58:40.98 --> 00:58:46.82 Firmly the company sergeant major Huggins told them the poles seem to understand after
00:58:46.82 --> 00:58:53.90 a few seconds of audible consultation they rose through their feet and walked across.
00:58:53.90 --> 00:58:57.42 So you got a just a chaotic situation.
00:58:57.42 --> 00:59:00.54 The poles land they're getting attacked from all directions and sure enough they're shooting
00:59:00.54 --> 00:59:05.10 at the friendly forces blue on blue happening.
00:59:05.10 --> 00:59:08.46 Once he gets them settled down he's got some people.
00:59:08.46 --> 00:59:12.26 Some of these Polish folks that now have no leadership back to the but calling Douglas
00:59:12.26 --> 00:59:16.38 over I told him they need now had a fourth section in seven puttune and within a few minutes
00:59:16.38 --> 00:59:20.86 the poles were digging hard under the two to the edge of their corpal the only comprehensible
00:59:20.86 --> 00:59:25.06 part of whose name sounded like Peter.
00:59:25.06 --> 00:59:29.90 The digging had hardly started when a Jeep roared down the track in the direction from
00:59:29.90 --> 00:59:32.14 the direction of the battalion headquarters.
00:59:32.14 --> 00:59:37.86 As it break to stop and the cover of the trees Jimmy Gret jumped out and ran towards us.
00:59:37.86 --> 00:59:46.70 Gret's news was startling we were all to withdraw to wolf haze in 15 minutes time.
00:59:46.70 --> 00:59:51.66 One could not just stand up and walk away from an enemy right on one's heels.
00:59:51.66 --> 00:59:57.26 In daylight the only way to withdraw was to move by bounds with platoons and companies covering
00:59:57.26 --> 00:59:59.66 one another back.
00:59:59.66 --> 01:00:03.90 The other plan was madness things over in the north must be bad indeed for the kernel
01:00:03.90 --> 01:00:07.58 to be rushed in this way but grazing instructions were unshakable.
01:00:07.58 --> 01:00:11.46 So they're digging in they're getting ordered get out of here we're going to leave and
01:00:11.46 --> 01:00:14.62 he's saying okay that's fine but guess what even when you leave you still use the
01:00:14.62 --> 01:00:18.94 fundamental principle of cover move and that's what he's wanting to do.
01:00:18.94 --> 01:00:24.10 So now they're on the retreat and here we go back to the book the pace was far too
01:00:24.10 --> 01:00:28.10 quick some men were all but running to keep up.
01:00:28.10 --> 01:00:32.18 As I had expected little by little cohesion was starting to break down some of the men of
01:00:32.18 --> 01:00:36.66 the mortar platoon had overtaken us despite the weight of the loads and were mixed in
01:00:36.66 --> 01:00:37.90 among us.
01:00:37.90 --> 01:00:41.90 There were two small groups from another unit in the middle of seven platoon from somewhere
01:00:41.90 --> 01:00:46.82 in the front along way off a spandal spent sent its bullets flying harmless the overhead
01:00:46.82 --> 01:00:50.02 but men were looking apprehensive and flinching.
01:00:50.02 --> 01:00:54.46 We were now under fire from two different directions and any men at the bush would find
01:00:54.46 --> 01:00:57.86 the range and then the slaughter would begin.
01:00:57.86 --> 01:01:02.02 Who is no longer an orderly retreat that would draw is taking on the nature of a
01:01:02.02 --> 01:01:05.10 horde of men seeking safety.
01:01:05.10 --> 01:01:09.58 Soon discipline would crack and everyone would start to run.
01:01:09.58 --> 01:01:16.14 What a target we must be some 500 men from four to five different units rapidly coalescing
01:01:16.14 --> 01:01:18.50 into a solid moving mass.
01:01:18.50 --> 01:01:24.30 Yeah this is just a nightmare and you can imagine it's an individual thing and you're
01:01:24.30 --> 01:01:27.34 going to see some great leadership examples but it's an individual thing because
01:01:27.34 --> 01:01:34.14 if you can keep the teams working together covering and moving for each other that's good
01:01:34.14 --> 01:01:38.86 you're going to keep the enemies heads down but if people in the group start saying you
01:01:38.86 --> 01:01:43.14 know what I'm not going to cover I'm going to run and now no one's covering and now
01:01:43.14 --> 01:01:46.78 you've got a bunch of people that are moving and no cover and that's when you're going
01:01:46.78 --> 01:01:52.14 to get slaughtered not only get slaughtered by people that are shooting at you but if
01:01:52.14 --> 01:01:56.82 you're not putting down cover fire the enemy maneuvers they don't just sit there
01:01:56.82 --> 01:01:59.78 I mean some of them will be shooting but they'll be shooting but other elements of them
01:01:59.78 --> 01:02:04.62 are going to move and they're going to be able to cut you off.
01:02:04.62 --> 01:02:08.10 They finally do make it back and I get a little bit of luck here.
01:02:08.10 --> 01:02:12.50 Here we go back to the book we caught our breath in the wood so they get to a woods.
01:02:12.50 --> 01:02:17.34 David's men had disappeared and there was no sign of the Colonel or the battalion headquarters.
01:02:17.34 --> 01:02:18.90 No one had followed us.
01:02:18.90 --> 01:02:23.98 We were the last across but a quick check told me that only Robert Watson the CSM and
01:02:23.98 --> 01:02:27.98 three or four other men were missing in addition to seven but soon.
01:02:27.98 --> 01:02:31.82 Of the latter there was nothing to be seen and all there were still about 50 men with
01:02:31.82 --> 01:02:37.90 me not counting Peter and his seven poles still clinging to naciously to us.
01:02:37.90 --> 01:02:42.58 Perhaps I should try to get back across the bullet spattered embankment to find out what
01:02:42.58 --> 01:02:48.02 it happened to the others but the noise of the battle was getting louder.
01:02:48.02 --> 01:02:49.90 The boat must be closing in.
01:02:49.90 --> 01:02:54.78 The vital thing must be to rejoin the rest of the battalion with the 50 men I still had
01:02:54.78 --> 01:02:59.78 and not to leave them in loop Tyler's charge while I returned on what could be a fool
01:02:59.78 --> 01:03:02.46 hearty errand.
01:03:02.46 --> 01:03:08.18 But it was difficult to avoid the thought that perhaps I was reluctant to climb back
01:03:08.18 --> 01:03:11.82 over the top of that embankment.
01:03:11.82 --> 01:03:16.30 So he does make it to this woods but he doesn't have everybody with him and he's questioning
01:03:16.30 --> 01:03:17.30 himself.
01:03:17.30 --> 01:03:23.30 Back over there and risk it or not and part of his part of his rationalizing you know
01:03:23.30 --> 01:03:26.34 I had the best thing to do is get back with the rest of the battalion but part of him
01:03:26.34 --> 01:03:30.26 is saying you're rationalizing this and you're just you're just not you're being
01:03:30.26 --> 01:03:32.26 a coward.
01:03:32.26 --> 01:03:35.62 But he does he proceeds on with the time he knows you're going to get killed if he goes
01:03:35.62 --> 01:03:38.30 over that he can hear the enemy coming.
01:03:38.30 --> 01:03:42.86 So back to the book 10 minutes later we found the remnants of the battalion.
01:03:42.86 --> 01:03:48.22 Half of a company the mortars and what was left of the machine guns were still missing
01:03:48.22 --> 01:03:50.86 as well as our own 7-platoon.
01:03:50.86 --> 01:03:56.58 More than one third of the men who had withdrawn from the woods had failed to cross the railway
01:03:56.58 --> 01:04:03.74 we were now down to no more than a couple of hundred men.
01:04:03.74 --> 01:04:09.28 So we're going we're down to a couple of hundred men from five or six hundred men in the
01:04:09.28 --> 01:04:10.94 battalion.
01:04:10.94 --> 01:04:16.02 Maybe even a little bit more maybe there might have been 700 men in the battalion.
01:04:16.02 --> 01:04:19.02 They get word once again.
01:04:19.02 --> 01:04:22.62 Here's what's going to happen tomorrow at first light the brigade would move on to
01:04:22.62 --> 01:04:26.14 Usterbeek to join the rest of the division.
01:04:26.14 --> 01:04:31.18 But unless ammunition together with Aaron artillery support was forthcoming the prospects
01:04:31.18 --> 01:04:33.50 were far from good.
01:04:33.50 --> 01:04:41.34 We were it seemed not opposed by a few third line troops elements of three SS Panzer
01:04:41.34 --> 01:04:44.82 divisions had been identified in the battle.
01:04:44.82 --> 01:04:49.38 The Germans seemed to have moved quickly or else something had gone wrong with the intelligence.
01:04:49.38 --> 01:04:53.66 It was not surprising that the days fighting had been so very bitter.
01:04:53.66 --> 01:04:56.86 So they're pointing out that they weren't going against you know third rate troops.
01:04:56.86 --> 01:05:03.18 They were going against SS Panzer divisions, the best of the German soldiers.
01:05:03.18 --> 01:05:11.62 And talking with Sergeant Major Bauer and Sergeant Nesbitt before I reached Tyler's
01:05:11.62 --> 01:05:16.26 platoon I had done my best to be as cheerful as possible but it was plain that the two
01:05:16.26 --> 01:05:20.50 NCOs realized that I was making the best of things.
01:05:20.50 --> 01:05:22.94 With Luke Tyler it was different.
01:05:22.94 --> 01:05:28.86 I could not insult him by trying to disguise our straits.
01:05:28.86 --> 01:05:34.70 I just told him the facts as I had received them from the Colonel possibly it was a mistake.
01:05:34.70 --> 01:05:38.30 Quite suddenly the failure of it all oppressed me.
01:05:38.30 --> 01:05:43.94 In less than 36 hours, two thirds of the battalion had gone.
01:05:43.94 --> 01:05:49.38 Fifteen rifle company officers had landed only two were left.
01:05:49.38 --> 01:05:53.38 Ten for certain had either been killed or wounded.
01:05:53.38 --> 01:05:58.14 The chances of surviving another day were small, fatigue and hunger had drained me.
01:05:58.14 --> 01:06:01.86 There was a need to unburden myself.
01:06:01.86 --> 01:06:06.90 Luke was junior in my rank but equal in years and in any case it was easier to confide
01:06:06.90 --> 01:06:11.82 in someone who was in many ways a stranger.
01:06:11.82 --> 01:06:16.14 Even as I spoke I was ashamed of this weakness.
01:06:16.14 --> 01:06:18.38 But there was no stopping.
01:06:18.38 --> 01:06:22.86 Quietly Luke gave me the reassurance I needed.
01:06:22.86 --> 01:06:27.78 The iron needed to sustain oneself through such a day was easily expended and I felt
01:06:27.78 --> 01:06:34.18 that I had perloined some of Luke's share.
01:06:34.18 --> 01:06:41.38 So he basically unloads to one of his guys or to another officer below him in rank.
01:06:41.38 --> 01:06:48.02 But what I think is interesting about this is he needed someone to talk to.
01:06:48.02 --> 01:06:52.06 He was holding it all inside and wasn't saying anything and trying to look positive.
01:06:52.06 --> 01:06:54.66 Even he's looking at his guys as he's telling them don't worry, Jens we're going to be
01:06:54.66 --> 01:06:55.66 okay.
01:06:55.66 --> 01:06:57.46 His guys are looking at him like, hey, no.
01:06:57.46 --> 01:06:58.90 We don't believe you.
01:06:58.90 --> 01:07:03.70 And so he has to, he feels the need to unload on someone and that's why I just think
01:07:03.70 --> 01:07:05.70 from my perspective.
01:07:05.70 --> 01:07:10.22 We always talk about relationships that you have on your team and for sure in your
01:07:10.22 --> 01:07:15.06 platoon or in your team it's really good to have someone that you can just kind of unload
01:07:15.06 --> 01:07:19.42 on that you know as professional enough to bolster you up without getting dragged down
01:07:19.42 --> 01:07:21.10 into your negativity.
01:07:21.10 --> 01:07:26.74 And a lot of times I've found if you have someone like that or maybe a couple people
01:07:26.74 --> 01:07:30.46 like that and your team that you can talk to will guess what?
01:07:30.46 --> 01:07:34.90 Sometimes they're going to be bolstering your attitude and sometimes you're going to
01:07:34.90 --> 01:07:36.62 be bolstering their attitude.
01:07:36.62 --> 01:07:41.46 And so you got to find someone like that that's in your team that you can say, man, this
01:07:41.46 --> 01:07:45.18 is this horrible, this is going wrong and someone's going to go, hey, you know, it's not
01:07:45.18 --> 01:07:46.18 that bad.
01:07:46.18 --> 01:07:47.18 We're going to get through it.
01:07:47.18 --> 01:07:49.86 And then two or three days later he might come into you and say, hey, this is a horrible
01:07:49.86 --> 01:07:50.86 situation.
01:07:50.86 --> 01:07:53.58 I can't believe this and you're going to say, no man, we're going to be all right.
01:07:53.58 --> 01:07:57.30 So I think it's important and that's again, we're building relationships, but that's
01:07:57.30 --> 01:08:02.70 one of the reasons we build relationships.
01:08:02.70 --> 01:08:05.98 They get into a hold-up position back to the book.
01:08:05.98 --> 01:08:10.54 On stand two rounds, I found the Polish trenches empty except for Peter, their corporal,
01:08:10.54 --> 01:08:13.66 crouched grimly behind his brain.
01:08:13.66 --> 01:08:17.82 The rest of the party had vanished in the early hours, sensing perhaps the data attached
01:08:17.82 --> 01:08:21.10 themselves to an unlucky unit.
01:08:21.10 --> 01:08:24.82 You're explained nothing, but his embarrassment was clear.
01:08:24.82 --> 01:08:29.70 It was both unfair and pointless to press him for details when either pride or sense of duty
01:08:29.70 --> 01:08:34.22 had kept him there to fight among strangers.
01:08:34.22 --> 01:08:37.34 The thought of what would have happened if the enemy had attacked from this direction
01:08:37.34 --> 01:08:42.50 against the position held by one solitary man was chilling.
01:08:42.50 --> 01:08:46.54 It was a mistake to trust strangers.
01:08:46.54 --> 01:08:54.22 I had learned yet another lesson, rely on only those you knew.
01:08:54.22 --> 01:08:59.50 Again, it's interesting how he sometimes backs off instead of pressing where your guys
01:08:59.50 --> 01:09:01.98 he knows is like, what point is that?
01:09:01.98 --> 01:09:06.14 When Bartholomew was running away, he didn't press him super hard.
01:09:06.14 --> 01:09:09.50 And you're going to get to a point where he does press people.
01:09:09.50 --> 01:09:11.10 But here he's deciding he's not going to do it.
01:09:11.10 --> 01:09:15.26 And the other interesting thing is here it says, I learned another lesson to rely, not
01:09:15.26 --> 01:09:18.26 to stress strangers, rely on only those you know.
01:09:18.26 --> 01:09:23.78 What you have to do in those situations is you have to put someone that you do trust
01:09:23.78 --> 01:09:27.14 in bed with these units that you don't know.
01:09:27.14 --> 01:09:32.14 If you were to take and he gave that section to one of his puttsoon commanders and said,
01:09:32.14 --> 01:09:37.02 hey, you got another section now, but maybe in bed one more guy or two more guys in there
01:09:37.02 --> 01:09:38.98 or split these guys up even more.
01:09:38.98 --> 01:09:42.82 So instead of seven and one big bulk, you put two or three there, two or three there,
01:09:42.82 --> 01:09:43.82 two or three there.
01:09:43.82 --> 01:09:47.50 And you can have better control over them.
01:09:47.50 --> 01:09:48.50 It's weird.
01:09:48.50 --> 01:09:56.78 There's this opportunity to desert though, and these guys took the opportunity.
01:09:56.78 --> 01:10:05.58 Now the fighting rages on and obviously I have to fast forward through some of it.
01:10:05.58 --> 01:10:11.26 And they eventually get into a little village, a little small village and they've taken
01:10:11.26 --> 01:10:12.26 down.
01:10:12.26 --> 01:10:14.26 And there's a lot of buildings.
01:10:14.26 --> 01:10:21.26 And here we go, there are these buildings back to the book we were in a mess.
01:10:21.26 --> 01:10:27.06 The boat was on the other side of the valley outnumbered and outgunned us.
01:10:27.06 --> 01:10:31.74 There was not the slightest hope of reaching the back of the breed line this way and
01:10:31.74 --> 01:10:34.82 to stay here on this forward slope was impossible.
01:10:34.82 --> 01:10:40.58 At this rate we would all be dead or wounded soon.
01:10:40.58 --> 01:10:45.54 Somehow I had to get the survivors back up the hill, but it was near, but it was a near,
01:10:45.54 --> 01:10:50.90 insuperable problem with the men scattered down among the houses, lawns and shrubberies
01:10:50.90 --> 01:10:53.94 shot at every time they moved.
01:10:53.94 --> 01:10:57.66 Someone called from the side of the house, as I turned and looked private Gregory darted
01:10:57.66 --> 01:11:01.54 across to throw himself down beside me.
01:11:01.54 --> 01:11:07.86 Under the dirt and two days scrub of beard, his face was grayish white.
01:11:07.86 --> 01:11:10.54 He seemed about to vomit.
01:11:10.54 --> 01:11:16.26 As Gregory stammered out, his platoon commander's name, I knew what had happened.
01:11:16.26 --> 01:11:20.22 Lieutenant Tyler was dead.
01:11:20.22 --> 01:11:22.54 It must have happened just after we parted.
01:11:22.54 --> 01:11:27.10 Luke had been killed on the steep garden path which led from the house down the road.
01:11:27.10 --> 01:11:31.22 He'd been hit by a sniper, killed outright by a bullet through the heart.
01:11:31.22 --> 01:11:35.38 We had a couple yards of the place where Gregory was lying.
01:11:35.38 --> 01:11:39.70 Possibly, Luke had been careless because he was still dazed, but he had to get back to
01:11:39.70 --> 01:11:42.10 his platoon and the path was his only route.
01:11:42.10 --> 01:11:48.22 So they had been together and they'd been hit by some kind of artillery in the house and
01:11:48.22 --> 01:11:53.66 it rattled them and then Luke had gone out to get back to his platoon and when he left
01:11:53.66 --> 01:11:56.02 he got shot by a sniper.
01:11:56.02 --> 01:12:02.46 Back to the book, this was how officers and NCOs were killed just doing their routine job.
01:12:02.46 --> 01:12:05.46 This was why casualties among the leaders were so high.
01:12:05.46 --> 01:12:10.02 All the time that they were moving about, checking here, encouraging their backwards and
01:12:10.02 --> 01:12:11.74 forwards.
01:12:11.74 --> 01:12:19.54 Now besides myself and only the quartermaster sergeant, bower and sergeant, whiner were
01:12:19.54 --> 01:12:21.54 left.
01:12:21.54 --> 01:12:26.42 All the rest of the officers and sergeants in the company had gone.
01:12:26.42 --> 01:12:30.26 One problem however had been solved, the remnants of Tyler's two forward sections had
01:12:30.26 --> 01:12:35.86 managed to extricate themselves without waiting for orders.
01:12:35.86 --> 01:12:39.58 Since last night, private Gregory had been in charge of one of the other sections, both
01:12:39.58 --> 01:12:43.78 the NCOs having been hit the day before.
01:12:43.78 --> 01:12:48.22 During that last mortar, stonk, a bomb and fallen right on top of the corpel who is commanding
01:12:48.22 --> 01:12:53.78 the other section, blowing him and his brain gunner have to pieces.
01:12:53.78 --> 01:12:58.30 Common sense had told the survivors to quit and there had been no one to stop them
01:12:58.30 --> 01:13:02.34 except Gregory, who for the moment was shaken by the sight of what had happened to his
01:13:02.34 --> 01:13:07.22 friends and who in any case lacked the authority to hold them there.
01:13:07.22 --> 01:13:11.86 No one else had been hit and scrambled back and the survivors were now sheltering in
01:13:11.86 --> 01:13:22.86 the house.
01:13:22.86 --> 01:13:27.86 Further in these houses and for the first time you're going to hear the company commander
01:13:27.86 --> 01:13:32.54 start to realize he's got people at the breaking point back to the book.
01:13:32.54 --> 01:13:35.26 The others were as uneasy as I was.
01:13:35.26 --> 01:13:38.78 For the first time I was unhappy about them.
01:13:38.78 --> 01:13:43.82 Until now they had endured the success of disasters but the events of the morning had
01:13:43.82 --> 01:13:46.82 tried them too far.
01:13:46.82 --> 01:13:51.86 It had been yesterday once again yet another failure, failure against an enemy who was far
01:13:51.86 --> 01:13:54.46 too strong for us.
01:13:54.46 --> 01:14:00.98 Men were looking jittery, some could be well near their breaking point.
01:14:00.98 --> 01:14:04.90 As I gaze down the slope trying to spot some activity among the bush, a movement to the
01:14:04.90 --> 01:14:06.42 right caught my eye.
01:14:06.42 --> 01:14:11.46 About 20 yards away two of Kelly's men were moving diagonally behind me, sheltered on the
01:14:11.46 --> 01:14:14.42 far side of the ridge.
01:14:14.42 --> 01:14:17.18 These are these are diserters.
01:14:17.18 --> 01:14:22.14 My shout made them hesitate and then stop after two or three more steps.
01:14:22.14 --> 01:14:26.66 For getting the enemy I stood up and strode down towards them.
01:14:26.66 --> 01:14:28.50 No explanation was necessary.
01:14:28.50 --> 01:14:32.70 The surly guilt on their faces was enough.
01:14:32.70 --> 01:14:37.70 Deliberately choosing words for effect, I cursed them in language rarely used by officers
01:14:37.70 --> 01:14:40.38 towards their shoulders.
01:14:40.38 --> 01:14:42.26 It was enough.
01:14:42.26 --> 01:14:48.90 The two men turned back towards their platoon.
01:14:48.90 --> 01:14:52.50 So like I said, sometimes they're dropping the hammer.
01:14:52.50 --> 01:14:57.34 These two guys are trying to deser and he drops the hammer on them and gets them back
01:14:57.34 --> 01:14:58.94 with their platoon.
01:14:58.94 --> 01:15:03.34 Back to the book and this mood the men would never stand up to an enemy attack.
01:15:03.34 --> 01:15:06.34 Even a mortar stunk could break them.
01:15:06.34 --> 01:15:08.50 I could see it happening.
01:15:08.50 --> 01:15:12.90 Each one or two men would slip away like the two I had just stopped and then a rush would
01:15:12.90 --> 01:15:14.66 follow.
01:15:14.66 --> 01:15:17.02 Something drastic had to be done.
01:15:17.02 --> 01:15:20.14 No more than the occasional rifle bullet was now coming over.
01:15:20.14 --> 01:15:24.38 In fact, no one had been hit since we took our positions along this ridge.
01:15:24.38 --> 01:15:27.38 It seemed safe enough.
01:15:27.38 --> 01:15:33.38 Standing up, I began to walk along the path towards the left of our position.
01:15:33.38 --> 01:15:37.34 For the first few steps I felt wretchedly vulnerable.
01:15:37.34 --> 01:15:42.86 But then an odd exorlation seized me.
01:15:42.86 --> 01:15:47.06 For the first few steps I felt wretchedly vulnerable.
01:15:47.06 --> 01:15:50.58 But then an odd exorlation seized me.
01:15:50.58 --> 01:15:52.98 Not too slowly and not too quickly.
01:15:52.98 --> 01:15:56.78 I strode deliberately toward the first group of men.
01:15:56.78 --> 01:16:00.70 Grating down at Lance Corporal Williams, I made some anept remark about it being the wrong
01:16:00.70 --> 01:16:04.14 place for a company clerk.
01:16:04.14 --> 01:16:08.06 If I were to be hit, it would happen anyway.
01:16:08.06 --> 01:16:11.02 Now seemed to be as good a time as ever.
01:16:11.02 --> 01:16:15.10 Stopping at each group of men, I checked their firing positions and made necessary changes.
01:16:15.10 --> 01:16:19.02 Then I was at the end of Kelly's line and I started back conscious that everyone was
01:16:19.02 --> 01:16:20.74 watching.
01:16:20.74 --> 01:16:22.50 There was a burst of machine gunfire.
01:16:22.50 --> 01:16:26.90 Well, why do of us, but I managed to avoid flinching at it?
01:16:26.90 --> 01:16:32.46 Suddenly, Sergeant Wee Winner's voice harsh with concern was yelling at me to get down,
01:16:32.46 --> 01:16:36.06 and landing angrily what I was playing at.
01:16:36.06 --> 01:16:37.50 The spell broke.
01:16:37.50 --> 01:16:43.74 I was grateful for the excuse to lower myself down beside him very relieved that it was over.
01:16:43.74 --> 01:16:48.66 The rage and winers face dissolved into an unacustomed grin.
01:16:48.66 --> 01:16:52.70 The corny, dramatic, were over, but they had served their purpose.
01:16:52.70 --> 01:16:55.74 The men had got a grip on themselves.
01:16:55.74 --> 01:17:03.50 So he basically stood up and walked around and talked to everyone and made himself visible
01:17:03.50 --> 01:17:09.70 and made himself appear to not be scared to get the guys heads back in the game until his
01:17:09.70 --> 01:17:14.82 sergeant, Weiner, yells at him and says, hey, dude, get down.
01:17:14.82 --> 01:17:18.34 When these guys are like the desert, what do they go?
01:17:18.34 --> 01:17:23.26 So they can head back towards towards the areas that have been secured.
01:17:23.26 --> 01:17:29.02 So as this beach edge, we landed D-Day, June 6th, this is now in September.
01:17:29.02 --> 01:17:34.58 So coalition forces or sort of allied forces had pushed into France.
01:17:34.58 --> 01:17:38.26 So if you could walk back, you could eventually get to friendly lines.
01:17:38.26 --> 01:17:39.26 Yeah.
01:17:39.26 --> 01:17:40.78 And that's what their plan was.
01:17:40.78 --> 01:17:44.74 And then what, when you get there, don't they know, hey, you deserted me?
01:17:44.74 --> 01:17:49.18 Well, you tell, you know, you say, oh, I got separated from my chiefs when I perished
01:17:49.18 --> 01:17:52.94 you today and I couldn't find my people or whatever you make up your lie.
01:17:52.94 --> 01:17:55.42 You deal with it later with the winder.
01:17:55.42 --> 01:17:57.18 Because right now you're thinking, I'm not going to make it.
01:17:57.18 --> 01:17:59.18 Yes, we want that.
01:17:59.18 --> 01:18:05.42 It was clear why nothing, we had heard nothing from battalion headquarters for the past
01:18:05.42 --> 01:18:06.42 two hours.
01:18:06.42 --> 01:18:11.98 Everyone else, the signalers, orderlies and clerks had been fighting for their own survival.
01:18:11.98 --> 01:18:15.98 The Germans were all around them and had been pressing them hard throughout the morning.
01:18:15.98 --> 01:18:21.38 So they're not getting any information about what's happening.
01:18:21.38 --> 01:18:23.10 This is interesting.
01:18:23.10 --> 01:18:27.86 He goes back to get, they end up with a little extra ammunition and he goes back to get
01:18:27.86 --> 01:18:29.86 some ammunition from the battalion.
01:18:29.86 --> 01:18:35.10 They have got it like stage in the battalion headquarters and as he's doing this, the
01:18:35.10 --> 01:18:37.06 ammunition was in a Jeep.
01:18:37.06 --> 01:18:39.06 And so he goes to the Jeep.
01:18:39.06 --> 01:18:44.18 He finds the Jeep and he's with one of his other guys and they're the regimental sergeant
01:18:44.18 --> 01:18:49.90 major is sitting basically on top of the Jeep on top of the ammunition.
01:18:49.90 --> 01:18:55.62 And he kind of is looking at the guy saying, hey, I'm here.
01:18:55.62 --> 01:18:56.62 I'm an officer.
01:18:56.62 --> 01:18:58.46 I got a platoon's out there and a company out there.
01:18:58.46 --> 01:19:00.70 I got to get the ammunition and he doesn't really move.
01:19:00.70 --> 01:19:03.82 He just kind of sits there.
01:19:03.82 --> 01:19:07.66 And so finally, here he was.
01:19:07.66 --> 01:19:11.66 But here the regimental sergeant major was in the middle of battle sitting on his
01:19:11.66 --> 01:19:16.86 arse and taking his ease while the company commander hunted for ammunition.
01:19:16.86 --> 01:19:21.50 Rangers are not in the habit of rebuking regimental sergeant majors, but this was too much.
01:19:21.50 --> 01:19:25.94 The tensions of the morning had snapped myself for restraint and in a couple of succinct
01:19:25.94 --> 01:19:32.78 sentences, I told the regimental sergeant major what I thought of him.
01:19:32.78 --> 01:19:38.22 Then the regimental sergeant major apologized, but he did not move.
01:19:38.22 --> 01:19:42.26 Without any trace of irony or annoyance in his voice, he quietly explained that he could
01:19:42.26 --> 01:19:46.38 not stand up because he had been shot through both legs.
01:19:46.38 --> 01:19:51.18 I had not noticed the airborne smock with which someone had covered his outstretched
01:19:51.18 --> 01:19:57.50 and bandaged legs.
01:19:57.50 --> 01:20:01.38 Think before you act.
01:20:01.38 --> 01:20:03.46 Now they're on their way.
01:20:03.46 --> 01:20:07.34 They're heading finally to this area of Usterbeek.
01:20:07.34 --> 01:20:08.70 They're on their patrol.
01:20:08.70 --> 01:20:09.70 And here we go.
01:20:09.70 --> 01:20:14.94 Back to the book, a spandail opening up ahead sent us all to the ground men diving for
01:20:14.94 --> 01:20:17.10 cover just a little too quickly.
01:20:17.10 --> 01:20:23.30 A moment later a second gun fired on us from the right, but it was the ominous rattle
01:20:23.30 --> 01:20:26.38 of the tracked vehicles which chilled.
01:20:26.38 --> 01:20:32.30 The first one, then another, then two more, quite close and in front, their engine clatter
01:20:32.30 --> 01:20:35.82 rising above the den of the machine gun and rifles.
01:20:35.82 --> 01:20:40.90 Then some 70 yards away, I saw the first of the SP guns.
01:20:40.90 --> 01:20:44.82 It's stubby weeping traversing slowly towards us.
01:20:44.82 --> 01:20:46.42 They're kind of like tanks.
01:20:46.42 --> 01:20:47.66 It's self-propelled guns.
01:20:47.66 --> 01:20:52.42 They're like artillery pieces with tracks on them.
01:20:52.42 --> 01:20:58.50 The flash from its stout, from its snout was one of the explosion of the bursting shell.
01:20:58.50 --> 01:21:03.22 Just to the right, a half-grown tree shattered into jagged splinters, a second shot falling
01:21:03.22 --> 01:21:07.38 hard on the first one, covered Harrison and me with earth.
01:21:07.38 --> 01:21:09.38 We were swamped by the noise.
01:21:09.38 --> 01:21:11.58 Every sort of weapon seemed to be firing.
01:21:11.58 --> 01:21:15.74 Grenades were exploding, but the distinct above the rest was the clank and the throaty
01:21:15.74 --> 01:21:18.54 cough of the armored guns.
01:21:18.54 --> 01:21:21.62 Caught like this in the open, we were helpless.
01:21:21.62 --> 01:21:26.66 Tanks plowing among, about among us, could have been no worse.
01:21:26.66 --> 01:21:30.82 There was no way of fighting back, no one to seem to have even a peot, which is like their
01:21:30.82 --> 01:21:32.90 bazooka, anti-ironed weapon.
01:21:32.90 --> 01:21:38.38 And we could not get close enough to use the gammon bombs, the bags of plastic explosive.
01:21:38.38 --> 01:21:40.38 They're very for use against armor.
01:21:40.38 --> 01:21:47.50 So that's another little big bag of explosives that you can put on an armor vehicle to destroy.
01:21:47.50 --> 01:21:50.74 They call them gammon bombs.
01:21:50.74 --> 01:21:52.18 The men in front were moving again.
01:21:52.18 --> 01:21:55.14 I stood up and signal those behind.
01:21:55.14 --> 01:21:56.14 To follow.
01:21:56.14 --> 01:21:58.98 We were doubling now, but there was still some sort of control.
01:21:58.98 --> 01:22:08.14 We were not running away, but making for somewhere where I did not know.
01:22:08.14 --> 01:22:14.38 Then about a hundred yards away, I caught a glimpse through the trees of a German half-track.
01:22:14.38 --> 01:22:17.86 It stopped and helmeted shapes jumped from its sides.
01:22:17.86 --> 01:22:19.98 How many more of them were there?
01:22:19.98 --> 01:22:24.62 This could be the start of another attack, which could only end it all.
01:22:24.62 --> 01:22:28.94 Our will to fight back was all but broken.
01:22:28.94 --> 01:22:34.66 Then I heard the brigadier telling me to clear the enemy out of the hollow, after which
01:22:34.66 --> 01:22:37.82 the survivors of the brigade would join us there.
01:22:37.82 --> 01:22:42.78 The Z company it seemed was the last organized body of troops.
01:22:42.78 --> 01:22:46.74 They're looking at this area, this open area, whether it's some enemy, but it looks like
01:22:46.74 --> 01:22:48.14 it's a good position.
01:22:48.14 --> 01:22:51.38 Of course, their will to fight is just about broken.
01:22:51.38 --> 01:22:57.94 You hear the brigadier saying, hey, take your company and clear out that hollow.
01:22:57.94 --> 01:22:59.26 Go.
01:22:59.26 --> 01:23:00.26 Back to the book.
01:23:00.26 --> 01:23:04.26 For a moment, I was so dumbfounded that I hardly heard the brigadier going on to say
01:23:04.26 --> 01:23:08.66 that the brigade major was dead as well, killed about five minutes ago.
01:23:08.66 --> 01:23:11.30 Another friend was gone, but I hardly listened.
01:23:11.30 --> 01:23:15.98 What was the brigadier ordering us to do in his quiet and determined fashion?
01:23:15.98 --> 01:23:17.38 It was absurd.
01:23:17.38 --> 01:23:21.66 The men were finished, only a few minutes ago I had realized that they were past defending
01:23:21.66 --> 01:23:23.06 themselves.
01:23:23.06 --> 01:23:27.50 Now we were being told to assault that bogey position.
01:23:27.50 --> 01:23:32.26 The brigadiers look was both quizzicle and encouraging.
01:23:32.26 --> 01:23:36.90 The confounded man could see what was passing through my mind.
01:23:36.90 --> 01:23:41.62 Then I was away, dodging back and through the bushes towards the men in the ditch even
01:23:41.62 --> 01:23:46.02 more aware than ever before of the bullets singing overhead.
01:23:46.02 --> 01:23:49.86 With my back to a broad tree which hid me from the enemy front, I looked down at the
01:23:49.86 --> 01:23:51.78 upturn faces.
01:23:51.78 --> 01:23:58.26 There was no point in wasting at all in wasting time on details.
01:23:58.26 --> 01:24:02.78 The orders I had to give them were quite simple, devoid of any complications such as who
01:24:02.78 --> 01:24:04.90 would provide covering fire.
01:24:04.90 --> 01:24:07.14 It was time for play acting again.
01:24:07.14 --> 01:24:12.18 My naturally loud voice, carrying down the line of men among the above the sound of battles,
01:24:12.18 --> 01:24:17.10 I balled at them to follow me, adding the comment that is better to be killed going for
01:24:17.10 --> 01:24:22.18 the bastards than lying in that bloody ditch.
01:24:22.18 --> 01:24:24.34 No one hesitated.
01:24:24.34 --> 01:24:28.74 The men rose to their feet at the moment I stepped out in the open from behind the shelter
01:24:28.74 --> 01:24:30.58 of the tree.
01:24:30.58 --> 01:24:35.78 Clancing to my right I was exhilarated by the sight of David unwins solid bulk running parallel
01:24:35.78 --> 01:24:39.74 to me and half a dozen of his men following.
01:24:39.74 --> 01:24:43.82 David shouted something to the effect that they were coming as well and I waved my
01:24:43.82 --> 01:24:46.42 stand gun and acknowledgement.
01:24:46.42 --> 01:24:52.22 Behind me, Sergeant Wyner broke into a scream of rage, harsh and furious.
01:24:52.22 --> 01:24:58.04 The yellow spread down the line, too heavily laden and too tired to sprint, we lumbered
01:24:58.04 --> 01:25:02.38 forward towards the enemy in a sort of jogged trot.
01:25:02.38 --> 01:25:05.30 Now I was careless of everything.
01:25:05.30 --> 01:25:10.38 We did not stand a chance, but this was the right way to go.
01:25:10.38 --> 01:25:13.62 This was the proper way to finish it all.
01:25:13.62 --> 01:25:20.30 Nearly hysterical now with rage and excitement I heard my own voice join in the screaming.
01:25:20.30 --> 01:25:21.86 The Germans were shooting at us.
01:25:21.86 --> 01:25:25.78 I could see flashes of their weapons springing out of the gloom of the trees.
01:25:25.78 --> 01:25:29.70 There was no need to look back to confirm that the line of men was still following.
01:25:29.70 --> 01:25:32.78 The noise told me they were there.
01:25:32.78 --> 01:25:35.54 Now the boats were no more than 50 yards away.
01:25:35.54 --> 01:25:39.58 As I brought my stand down to hit level to press the trigger, it flashed through my mind
01:25:39.58 --> 01:25:43.78 that it was the first time I had fired my weapons since the battle started.
01:25:43.78 --> 01:25:45.86 My four fingers squeezed the metal.
01:25:45.86 --> 01:25:46.86 Nothing happened.
01:25:46.86 --> 01:25:48.66 It had jammed.
01:25:48.66 --> 01:25:54.34 Here I was running toward the enemy with a useless piece of metal in my hands.
01:25:54.34 --> 01:25:56.42 There were figures moving among the trees.
01:25:56.42 --> 01:26:01.02 First a couple, then a half dozen dark shapes were outlined against the green background.
01:26:01.02 --> 01:26:03.98 Men sprinting away, men disappearing through the trees.
01:26:03.98 --> 01:26:06.90 The boat were running away.
01:26:06.90 --> 01:26:08.42 We had done it.
01:26:08.42 --> 01:26:12.58 We had driven the enemy out at the point of bayonet.
01:26:12.58 --> 01:26:15.70 This was the ultimate in war.
01:26:15.70 --> 01:26:20.14 The sight of the savage, screaming, parachutes, streaming towards them.
01:26:20.14 --> 01:26:22.54 It had been too much for the Germans.
01:26:22.54 --> 01:26:32.50 Even though they had to do nothing more than keep their heads and shoot straight.
01:26:32.50 --> 01:26:33.50 Yeah.
01:26:33.50 --> 01:26:35.30 So there you go.
01:26:35.30 --> 01:26:36.66 Surrounded, broken.
01:26:36.66 --> 01:26:43.94 And I think key point here, when you're think you're broken, do something and do something
01:26:43.94 --> 01:26:44.94 aggressive.
01:26:44.94 --> 01:26:48.62 That's the, this is 100% de-falte aggressive.
01:26:48.62 --> 01:26:49.62 That's what this is.
01:26:49.62 --> 01:26:50.62 You know what?
01:26:50.62 --> 01:26:51.62 We're being defensive.
01:26:51.62 --> 01:26:52.98 We're hiding in our slit trenches.
01:26:52.98 --> 01:26:54.50 Okay, you know what we're going to do?
01:26:54.50 --> 01:26:55.98 We're going to attack.
01:26:55.98 --> 01:26:57.98 We're going to attack full force.
01:26:57.98 --> 01:26:58.98 Yeah.
01:26:58.98 --> 01:27:03.90 Back to the book, the sight of David on the right added to my delight.
01:27:03.90 --> 01:27:07.74 Shouting to him to hold the right of the hollow, I directed Sergeant Weiner round to the
01:27:07.74 --> 01:27:08.74 left.
01:27:08.74 --> 01:27:10.94 There was no need to tell anyone to hurry.
01:27:10.94 --> 01:27:15.70 They all knew that the Germans would not delay in mounting a counterattack.
01:27:15.70 --> 01:27:17.66 A moan of terror distracted me.
01:27:17.66 --> 01:27:19.46 I turned to the wounded German.
01:27:19.46 --> 01:27:24.94 The man's features were contorted into a rickness of despair.
01:27:24.94 --> 01:27:31.62 Above him stood Sergeant Major Kelly, red, eyed and panting, his band at raised above
01:27:31.62 --> 01:27:34.06 the soldier's stomach.
01:27:34.06 --> 01:27:35.74 But Kelly did not strike.
01:27:35.74 --> 01:27:40.90 He was relishing the moment, snatching maximum pleasure from the wounded man's anguish
01:27:40.90 --> 01:27:45.02 before he slifed it, sliced into the soft belly.
01:27:45.02 --> 01:27:50.52 As my newly found mouser knocked the bayonet to one side, the Sergeant Major snalled
01:27:50.52 --> 01:27:55.78 at me in an unspoken protest at such silly scruples.
01:27:55.78 --> 01:27:57.82 Then he seemed to shake himself.
01:27:57.82 --> 01:27:59.82 The blood lust has passed.
01:27:59.82 --> 01:28:05.22 Then he came to his senses, gathering his men to the defenses.
01:28:05.22 --> 01:28:12.14 So again, he could this guy go from the pure fury and rage of this incredible bayonet
01:28:12.14 --> 01:28:13.78 assault.
01:28:13.78 --> 01:28:18.18 And then he immediately just puts his one of his Sergeant Major's in check, who's about
01:28:18.18 --> 01:28:23.34 to, you know, rit ruthlessly killed this wounded guy.
01:28:23.34 --> 01:28:28.66 Very interesting dichotomy there.
01:28:28.66 --> 01:28:32.38 Back to the book, something had been snatched back from the disasters in the day.
01:28:32.38 --> 01:28:35.90 The remnants of the brigade headquarters together with a few stragglers from other units
01:28:35.90 --> 01:28:37.58 had now all arrived.
01:28:37.58 --> 01:28:42.54 In all there seemed to be about 150 men with a half a dozen officers, as well as the brigadier
01:28:42.54 --> 01:28:45.98 David and myself, there was Jimmy Gray.
01:28:45.98 --> 01:28:50.38 The latter brought news that the Colonel was probably dead, although he could not be sure
01:28:50.38 --> 01:28:55.26 as they'd become separated during a scrimmage within SP gun.
01:28:55.26 --> 01:29:00.42 Of the rest of the officers who had jumped with a battalion, Captain John Simmons, the
01:29:00.42 --> 01:29:12.50 gunner for an observer was the only left one left.
01:29:12.50 --> 01:29:17.34 Continuing, after about 15 minutes a low-enshooting suggested that I might now be able
01:29:17.34 --> 01:29:20.58 to get round to visit the Battalion positions.
01:29:20.58 --> 01:29:25.42 The Battalion, for the first time it struck me that I was now in command of what was left
01:29:25.42 --> 01:29:26.82 of it.
01:29:26.82 --> 01:29:30.42 The beautiful remnants, but they are still fighting.
01:29:30.42 --> 01:29:35.42 The brigadier had allotted the south and west sides of the perimeter to us.
01:29:35.42 --> 01:29:40.26 The first pit held sergeant whiner with seven or eight men.
01:29:40.26 --> 01:29:45.74 At the bottom his eyes shut, lay a gray face to motionless private Gregory, shot through
01:29:45.74 --> 01:29:48.30 his stomach.
01:29:48.30 --> 01:29:53.42 Corporal Pritured had bandaged him up and given a shot of Morphea, but because his airborne
01:29:53.42 --> 01:29:57.58 smock had been pulled down over his bloodstained dressing to keep his warmest possible, he
01:29:57.58 --> 01:30:02.46 laid there with no outward sign of injury, looking as a man might do who had collapsed
01:30:02.46 --> 01:30:05.26 with exhaustion.
01:30:05.26 --> 01:30:07.50 Gregory's eyes opened.
01:30:07.50 --> 01:30:12.14 When he saw who is standing over him, he asked for the favor.
01:30:12.14 --> 01:30:18.94 His voice was quiet, his words measured and coherent, his proposal quite logical.
01:30:18.94 --> 01:30:24.58 But here, without the help of a doctor, he was going to die in any case and he could
01:30:24.58 --> 01:30:27.86 stand the pain no longer.
01:30:27.86 --> 01:30:32.30 Which someone please put a bullet through his head.
01:30:32.30 --> 01:30:35.98 For the moment my grip tightened on the mouser.
01:30:35.98 --> 01:30:41.26 In Gregory's state, I probably would have been asking for the same release.
01:30:41.26 --> 01:30:46.54 If it did happen, I hope that someone would have the guts to give it to me.
01:30:46.54 --> 01:30:52.70 And I caught winers eye, and he knew that I could not do it.
01:30:52.70 --> 01:30:57.18 The only way to help Gregory was to give him a further shot of Morphea dangerous though
01:30:57.18 --> 01:30:59.98 it would be to do so.
01:30:59.98 --> 01:31:06.74 As I reach for my own ampule, in the breast pocket of my smock, I was ashamed by my reluctance.
01:31:06.74 --> 01:31:08.62 The reason was purely selfish.
01:31:08.62 --> 01:31:12.86 Sooner or later I might want to use it on myself wounded and alone behind a bush with
01:31:12.86 --> 01:31:15.82 no one about to help me.
01:31:15.82 --> 01:31:17.82 But Sergeant Winer came to the rescue.
01:31:17.82 --> 01:31:23.78 He had scrounge to couple a supply of ampules from somewhere or another.
01:31:23.78 --> 01:31:31.22 Opening the small black tin, he bared Gregory's arm and pressed the needle home.
01:31:31.22 --> 01:31:36.64 The words of sympathy and encouragement sounded pitifully trite, as I pressed Gregory's
01:31:36.64 --> 01:31:39.18 shoulder.
01:31:39.18 --> 01:31:42.18 Nervous of any reproach which I might see.
01:31:42.18 --> 01:32:00.18 I turned and walked away without looking at the wounded man's face.
01:32:00.18 --> 01:32:03.26 My name was being called.
01:32:03.26 --> 01:32:05.26 It was private Jones.
01:32:05.26 --> 01:32:09.66 Slythering towards me down the opposite slope of the hollowed Jones told me quickly.
01:32:09.66 --> 01:32:13.66 It was major unwinn, killed by a sniper.
01:32:13.66 --> 01:32:17.38 Shot through the forehead as he was peering over the rim of the hollow, trying to locate
01:32:17.38 --> 01:32:21.46 the wearabouts of a spando machine gun.
01:32:21.46 --> 01:32:23.46 He had died instantly.
01:32:23.46 --> 01:32:26.94 Jones was adamant there was no doubt that he was dead.
01:32:26.94 --> 01:32:29.74 His brain had been blown out.
01:32:29.74 --> 01:32:36.18 Jones was urging me to come see his body, but I could not bring myself to do so.
01:32:36.18 --> 01:32:38.98 They if it could not be dead.
01:32:38.98 --> 01:32:41.26 They could not have killed David.
01:32:41.26 --> 01:32:46.46 Everyone else, yes, one after another friends had died, but I never believed that this
01:32:46.46 --> 01:32:55.70 could happen in David so vast, so indestructible, the humorous, gentle David.
01:32:55.70 --> 01:32:58.82 The brigadier was beside me.
01:32:58.82 --> 01:33:01.78 He had also heard the news.
01:33:01.78 --> 01:33:09.62 More nearly two years, he had known us both and it was playing that he understood the anguish.
01:33:09.62 --> 01:33:14.34 But there were other things to think about.
01:33:14.34 --> 01:33:19.98 As we knew, only two well, the brigadier told us, our ammunition was nearly finished.
01:33:19.98 --> 01:33:24.46 And as our own fire slackened, the enemy snipers were becoming bolder and more men were
01:33:24.46 --> 01:33:26.50 being hit.
01:33:26.50 --> 01:33:31.74 Soon we would be forced to surrender, so we had decided to take the initiative.
01:33:31.74 --> 01:33:36.78 We would break out towards Usterbeek, charging through the enemy and solid mass, trusting
01:33:36.78 --> 01:33:41.06 our numbers and impetus to get through.
01:33:41.06 --> 01:33:43.82 It was an extraordinary plan.
01:33:43.82 --> 01:33:50.38 For the second time that day, the brigadier was ordering us to do what seemed impossible.
01:33:50.38 --> 01:33:53.50 But our trust in the brigadier's judgment was now implicit.
01:33:53.50 --> 01:33:58.94 It was a gamble, but one which offered at least a chance of success.
01:33:58.94 --> 01:34:04.38 The stay here would only win one way.
01:34:04.38 --> 01:34:07.58 15 minutes later, we were ready.
01:34:07.58 --> 01:34:09.18 It could have been the start of a race.
01:34:09.18 --> 01:34:13.86 The brigadier asked whether we were ready, then at his shout, the hundred of us rose to
01:34:13.86 --> 01:34:18.30 our feet and exploded in a solid mass over the lip of the hollow.
01:34:18.30 --> 01:34:22.30 In front was the brigadier himself, leading the way.
01:34:22.30 --> 01:34:27.62 Behind came the yelling, screaming men, filthy and bloodstained, weapons in their hands,
01:34:27.62 --> 01:34:33.70 and that dull and menacing a fearful sight to anyone in our path.
01:34:33.70 --> 01:34:38.66 The German fire now seemed to be coming from every direction, but I saw no one hit.
01:34:38.66 --> 01:34:45.66 We were rushing downhill along a lane, a solid human battering ram.
01:34:45.66 --> 01:34:50.86 The first wild plate, paced, slacking the firing stopped.
01:34:50.86 --> 01:34:52.30 We had done it.
01:34:52.30 --> 01:34:55.50 We were through the enemy and out of the forest.
01:34:55.50 --> 01:35:04.58 We were the second time that day boldness had saved us.
01:35:04.58 --> 01:35:10.78 Once again, some default to aggressive activity.
01:35:10.78 --> 01:35:19.90 Obviously, I want to make it clear that both these situations, it wasn't a call of
01:35:19.90 --> 01:35:27.94 hey, there's a objective we want to reach, charge it.
01:35:27.94 --> 01:35:33.62 It can either sit here and do nothing and die or we can attack.
01:35:33.62 --> 01:35:37.06 That's the big, I don't want anyone out there thinking, okay, I'm just going to every
01:35:37.06 --> 01:35:38.26 time default the aggressive.
01:35:38.26 --> 01:35:40.42 I'm going to run and we're going to attack.
01:35:40.42 --> 01:35:46.06 No, these are situations where the alternative to attacking is being defensive laying down
01:35:46.06 --> 01:35:52.86 and dying and continuing to get picked off and snipers until you get overrun.
01:35:52.86 --> 01:35:59.62 Now they meet up with, finally, they meet up with these other British troops.
01:35:59.62 --> 01:36:02.30 Back to the book, someone was leading us into a garden of a large house.
01:36:02.30 --> 01:36:05.70 The men dropped to the ground as they halted the conscious that they were now safe with
01:36:05.70 --> 01:36:09.22 houses and other British troops around them.
01:36:09.22 --> 01:36:15.18 Others after a swig from a water bottle, lay supine unconscious in instant sleep.
01:36:15.18 --> 01:36:16.66 I counted them.
01:36:16.66 --> 01:36:21.26 Jimmy Gray, John Simmons, and Sergeant Winer were there.
01:36:21.26 --> 01:36:25.66 Sergeant Major Kelly was missing, someone had seen him fall in the rush.
01:36:25.66 --> 01:36:30.46 There were just 49 other men about half from sea company.
01:36:30.46 --> 01:36:42.58 Last night there had been 200, the night before 500.
01:36:42.58 --> 01:36:45.70 Other in these positions.
01:36:45.70 --> 01:36:50.94 And they're about to get attacked just below in the garden, but out of sight another
01:36:50.94 --> 01:36:51.94 Bren opened up.
01:36:51.94 --> 01:36:54.42 It was Jimmy Gray's century at the garden gate.
01:36:54.42 --> 01:36:58.94 There was a glimpse of a camouflage figure running through the trees opposite.
01:36:58.94 --> 01:37:03.54 No more than 100 yards away diagonally across our front towards the air landing troops.
01:37:03.54 --> 01:37:04.54 Then a couple more.
01:37:04.54 --> 01:37:09.30 Jimmy's Bren fired again and one of the figures pitched forward rolling over, carried on
01:37:09.30 --> 01:37:10.58 by its own momentum.
01:37:10.58 --> 01:37:18.82 We would have to fight, and this is their talking, talking about the fact that they're
01:37:18.82 --> 01:37:22.58 in the houses now in this village.
01:37:22.58 --> 01:37:27.10 We would have to fight from the house itself, not from the trenches in the garden.
01:37:27.10 --> 01:37:31.18 It was a sturdy building with thick solid walls, and in any case the garden was too small
01:37:31.18 --> 01:37:32.58 for the purpose.
01:37:32.58 --> 01:37:37.86 From these upper windows, we would have an extra range and observation to fire diagonally
01:37:37.86 --> 01:37:42.74 down the road in front of the houses held by units to the left and right.
01:37:42.74 --> 01:37:47.02 15 minutes later, the trim Dutch house had been wrecked.
01:37:47.02 --> 01:37:51.10 Every pain of glass had been smashed, and every picture and mirror knock from the walls
01:37:51.10 --> 01:37:53.38 there was no time to be careful.
01:37:53.38 --> 01:37:57.78 In the center of each room barricades had been built, well back from the windows out of sight
01:37:57.78 --> 01:38:02.98 of the bush, but sighted so that every scrap of ground outside was covered.
01:38:02.98 --> 01:38:07.54 Sideboards and chests of drawer stuff with books are bedding, made the barricades, contents
01:38:07.54 --> 01:38:11.54 of the furniture flung and heaps into corners of the rooms.
01:38:11.54 --> 01:38:16.18 Matchuses were rolled down into the basement ready for use if needed by wounded men.
01:38:16.18 --> 01:38:20.26 More books crammed into drawers, were blocking those windows, not required for shooting
01:38:20.26 --> 01:38:21.26 through.
01:38:21.26 --> 01:38:26.22 Fortunately, the owner of the house possessed a fine library from its content seemed
01:38:26.22 --> 01:38:28.78 a-whose a doctor.
01:38:28.78 --> 01:38:33.10 With gray, I walked around the house for a final check before leaving to return to my own
01:38:33.10 --> 01:38:35.62 headquarters at the rear.
01:38:35.62 --> 01:38:40.34 Like vandals might have swept through it, some woman's life work ruined in the time it
01:38:40.34 --> 01:38:49.82 took to drink a cup of coffee.
01:38:49.82 --> 01:38:54.10 An explosion from above followed by the clatter of tiles falling from the roof drowned
01:38:54.10 --> 01:38:55.62 out the noise from the gun.
01:38:55.62 --> 01:38:59.82 Another bomb burst in the garden just outside the window sending a couple fragments whistling
01:38:59.82 --> 01:39:00.82 into the room.
01:39:00.82 --> 01:39:05.98 Now the bush were hitting us with mortars as well.
01:39:05.98 --> 01:39:11.46 A bullet splintered of the empty frame behind me and buried itself in the ceiling, a warning
01:39:11.46 --> 01:39:15.66 that I was far too close to the back bedroom window.
01:39:15.66 --> 01:39:19.18 There was a sniper behind us as well as the spandle.
01:39:19.18 --> 01:39:22.82 A quick movement in the garden of the house caught my eye.
01:39:22.82 --> 01:39:26.70 Then two figures in the wrong sort of camouflaged darted from behind a bush into the shelter
01:39:26.70 --> 01:39:27.70 of a wall.
01:39:27.70 --> 01:39:29.58 They were bush, not British.
01:39:29.58 --> 01:39:32.78 So now the enemy was indeed all around us.
01:39:32.78 --> 01:39:35.98 There was no doubt about it now.
01:39:35.98 --> 01:39:39.98 John Simmons and his men were in the houses where they had been left that morning.
01:39:39.98 --> 01:39:44.18 John had made strong points out of a couple of houses, smaller but just as robust as the
01:39:44.18 --> 01:39:46.62 ones held by gray.
01:39:46.62 --> 01:39:51.50 The two groups had been working closely together largely I felt certain because of John's
01:39:51.50 --> 01:39:54.30 charm of manner and determination.
01:39:54.30 --> 01:39:56.42 This young gunner had done very well.
01:39:56.42 --> 01:40:01.46 It hardly seemed possible that most of his men hardly knew him by sight yesterday.
01:40:01.46 --> 01:40:06.46 Today he has welded the survivors of four different companies of a unit into of another
01:40:06.46 --> 01:40:10.22 arm into a tight knit entity.
01:40:10.22 --> 01:40:13.02 Well capable of carrying on the fight.
01:40:13.02 --> 01:40:17.42 All day they had held firm, killing and wounding quite a lot of enemy, losing only one
01:40:17.42 --> 01:40:22.22 man themselves, a corpile of a company whose hand had been blown in half by a flying
01:40:22.22 --> 01:40:25.38 mortar splinter.
01:40:25.38 --> 01:40:32.22 Mind and filthy though his face was eyes red rimmed and chin stained with three days worth
01:40:32.22 --> 01:40:34.38 of fair fuzzy down.
01:40:34.38 --> 01:40:41.86 John still moved briskly, a reminder to all of us that we could still keep going.
01:40:41.86 --> 01:40:45.94 So he's got guys that are stepping up big time.
01:40:45.94 --> 01:40:49.58 Inside the houses we felt reasonably safe from the shells and bullets but there was always
01:40:49.58 --> 01:40:53.78 some cause for the officers and senior NCOs to move about and open from one building to
01:40:53.78 --> 01:40:54.78 another.
01:40:54.78 --> 01:40:56.98 It was the same as it had been in the woods.
01:40:56.98 --> 01:41:00.70 The officers and sergeants sort of straighter, greater chance of being killed or wounded
01:41:00.70 --> 01:41:02.46 as their men.
01:41:02.46 --> 01:41:05.10 All the same, it was easier for an officer.
01:41:05.10 --> 01:41:09.06 With so much to do, he had little time to worry about his own safety.
01:41:09.06 --> 01:41:14.90 Also he always had to try and act the part to set an example to the others.
01:41:14.90 --> 01:41:19.34 An officer had to exude confidence however hard it might be.
01:41:19.34 --> 01:41:24.46 But because he always had to try to keep a grip on himself, it helped him forget the danger.
01:41:24.46 --> 01:41:27.54 Very true.
01:41:27.54 --> 01:41:28.54 Very true.
01:41:28.54 --> 01:41:34.26 Got a lot of things on your mind.
01:41:34.26 --> 01:41:42.22 They get a massive bombardment in these positions that they're in.
01:41:42.22 --> 01:41:45.82 Back to the book, the Germans must be softening us up in preparation for something more
01:41:45.82 --> 01:41:46.82 serious.
01:41:46.82 --> 01:41:49.78 Their ammunition seemed unlimited.
01:41:49.78 --> 01:41:53.42 The bombardment ended quite suddenly, rather as it had started.
01:41:53.42 --> 01:41:55.22 This would be it.
01:41:55.22 --> 01:41:59.10 Nudging Williams to get his head up from behind the barricade, I shouted a warning to the
01:41:59.10 --> 01:42:00.10 others.
01:42:00.10 --> 01:42:03.78 Elkins and bow were in the next room and the two signulars who had moved up to the bedroom
01:42:03.78 --> 01:42:05.34 at the back.
01:42:05.34 --> 01:42:09.18 The stutter of the bread gun cut across the woods.
01:42:09.18 --> 01:42:13.98 Bowers rifle-footed next door and then Williams was firing a succession of bursts from
01:42:13.98 --> 01:42:15.86 his bread gun.
01:42:15.86 --> 01:42:21.78 In the orchard opposite, Germans were running through the trees towards us, several dropped.
01:42:21.78 --> 01:42:24.54 This could only be the start of an attack.
01:42:24.54 --> 01:42:29.02 Now from either flank, the sound of rifles and machine guns reached us, accompanied by
01:42:29.02 --> 01:42:30.98 the thought of exploding grenades.
01:42:30.98 --> 01:42:35.26 The attack was coming in all along our front.
01:42:35.26 --> 01:42:39.86 Some of the Germans among the fruit trees were firing back, a couple of rifle bullets splintered
01:42:39.86 --> 01:42:42.06 the front of the wardrobe.
01:42:42.06 --> 01:42:46.82 And more gray figures were lumbering towards us through the trees, some fell, others ducked
01:42:46.82 --> 01:42:49.42 behind the puny trees.
01:42:49.42 --> 01:42:51.58 They didn't stand a chance.
01:42:51.58 --> 01:42:55.38 It was like shooting targets on the practice range.
01:42:55.38 --> 01:43:02.02 The Germans and the mortars had been forced to stop because their troops were so close.
01:43:02.02 --> 01:43:10.30 So it was possible to fire slow, carefully aimed shots with little or no distraction.
01:43:10.30 --> 01:43:15.10 The only way out of the orchard was through the single gap in the high fence, but the enemy
01:43:15.10 --> 01:43:19.74 soldiers never got within 20 yards of it.
01:43:19.74 --> 01:43:24.78 A tall German officer was standing in the middle of the drive, out in the open clear of
01:43:24.78 --> 01:43:29.42 the trees, waving his arms to the men behind him.
01:43:29.42 --> 01:43:35.50 No more than 50 yards away, every detail of his face and uniform was clearly visible.
01:43:35.50 --> 01:43:41.50 He was a handsome young man, fair-haired and smartly turned out.
01:43:41.50 --> 01:43:47.74 Already he'd been standing there for about five seconds, encouraging his men to advance.
01:43:47.74 --> 01:43:51.62 As I leveled my sights on the German officer, I knew that I was looking at someone
01:43:51.62 --> 01:43:54.94 who was just about to die.
01:43:54.94 --> 01:43:57.02 It seemed a pity.
01:43:57.02 --> 01:44:01.14 He was such a courageous boy, just the sort.
01:44:01.14 --> 01:44:06.02 As the sort one would like to have had as a platoon commander.
01:44:06.02 --> 01:44:10.46 My fingers started to squeeze the trigger, but it was too late.
01:44:10.46 --> 01:44:12.18 Someone else had fired.
01:44:12.18 --> 01:44:17.02 The German fell, spread-eagled and lay still.
01:44:17.02 --> 01:44:20.06 At least he died quickly.
01:44:20.06 --> 01:44:25.14 The death of the young officer marked the end of the attack.
01:44:25.14 --> 01:44:31.30 Now no one moved in the orchard except for a single wounded man squirming his way back through
01:44:31.30 --> 01:44:35.86 the trees.
01:44:35.86 --> 01:44:43.46 So it's interesting when you take the leader and the leader goes down and the attacks over.
01:44:43.46 --> 01:44:50.34 Now also it's important to note that although the leader stood up and encouraged the attack
01:44:50.34 --> 01:44:54.06 by taking that risk of being out there in front of everyone, in this case it didn't
01:44:54.06 --> 01:45:00.30 work out well because he got shot, killed, and the attack faltered.
01:45:00.30 --> 01:45:04.42 Perhaps if he could have found a little bit better of a position to do that from, then
01:45:04.42 --> 01:45:12.22 maybe he would have been able to encourage his troops and stay alive.
01:45:12.22 --> 01:45:17.22 Back to the book, but we had won no more than a temporary respite.
01:45:17.22 --> 01:45:21.38 15 minutes later we could hear the unnerving noise once again.
01:45:21.38 --> 01:45:24.90 Those were clattering towards us.
01:45:24.90 --> 01:45:29.94 So I don't know why I haven't talked about this yet, but here you have these airborne
01:45:29.94 --> 01:45:37.54 troops on the ground and their biggest fear is tanks and you've heard me talk many times
01:45:37.54 --> 01:45:46.82 about my love for tanks and how effective and awesome they are as tools and as weapons
01:45:46.82 --> 01:45:53.90 and the way that the tankers utilize them, they're just they're just awesome machines.
01:45:53.90 --> 01:46:02.02 But here you have the tables turned and the good guys don't have any effective way of
01:46:02.02 --> 01:46:03.46 stopping these tanks.
01:46:03.46 --> 01:46:09.66 You can shoot a machine gun all day long at a panzer tank and it's not going to do a damn
01:46:09.66 --> 01:46:11.38 thing.
01:46:11.38 --> 01:46:15.54 And so it can just, and by the way you hide and build and cool, a tank will go right through
01:46:15.54 --> 01:46:16.54 a building.
01:46:16.54 --> 01:46:18.46 They go right through buildings.
01:46:18.46 --> 01:46:20.26 They will go right through a building.
01:46:20.26 --> 01:46:23.46 Like it looks like a construction piece of heavy equipment.
01:46:23.46 --> 01:46:24.46 That's what it looks like.
01:46:24.46 --> 01:46:26.42 It'll go right through a building like it's nothing.
01:46:26.42 --> 01:46:31.26 So these guys are absolutely horrified of the tank showing up.
01:46:31.26 --> 01:46:35.62 That's their fear.
01:46:35.62 --> 01:46:41.26 Tracks were clattering toward us, a gun footage and the dark red house opposite began
01:46:41.26 --> 01:46:45.50 to fall apart as round after round crashed into it.
01:46:45.50 --> 01:46:49.62 Also flashes from the far side of the orchard revealed the position of the attacker, but
01:46:49.62 --> 01:46:52.46 there was nothing we could do.
01:46:52.46 --> 01:46:57.38 At least the men were not waiting in the house, but slipping one after another out the door
01:46:57.38 --> 01:47:01.62 back across the road to the headquarters house.
01:47:01.62 --> 01:47:05.70 On either side, the guns were firing.
01:47:05.70 --> 01:47:10.86 Now it was our turn.
01:47:10.86 --> 01:47:18.90 The tank wrecks some of the houses and then it the tank leaves.
01:47:18.90 --> 01:47:19.90 So here we go.
01:47:19.90 --> 01:47:21.30 It was time to strike back.
01:47:21.30 --> 01:47:26.98 The tanks had gone and as yet the bush did not appear to have occupied the houses.
01:47:26.98 --> 01:47:32.82 Lying out there in the rear gardens overlooked from the windows, we were vulnerable indeed.
01:47:32.82 --> 01:47:34.54 Soon the morgering would start again.
01:47:34.54 --> 01:47:38.26 Then we would be safe for back in the ruin buildings.
01:47:38.26 --> 01:47:43.70 John Simmons listened to the instructions, the young captain's manner was as relaxed
01:47:43.70 --> 01:47:45.42 as ever.
01:47:45.42 --> 01:47:47.66 Calm and outwardly self-confident.
01:47:47.66 --> 01:47:51.26 He somehow managed to give the impression that he was almost enjoying the morning's
01:47:51.26 --> 01:47:52.26 work.
01:47:52.26 --> 01:47:54.82 Possibly he was making that a point.
01:47:54.82 --> 01:48:00.42 Subconsciously perhaps that a gunner could always take charge of 30 infantrymen.
01:48:00.42 --> 01:48:07.74 But there were undoubtedly immense reserves of strength hidden behind that cool exterior.
01:48:07.74 --> 01:48:12.02 As he lay behind the bed of half dead pea plants scanning the houses for any sign of
01:48:12.02 --> 01:48:16.86 German occupants, there was no trace of disquiet in his voice as he discussed his orders
01:48:16.86 --> 01:48:21.82 to counter attack and clear the street of the enemy.
01:48:21.82 --> 01:48:26.22 15 minutes after John had gone, I was still in the same place in the vegetable patch watching
01:48:26.22 --> 01:48:31.02 the second hand of my watch creep towards the top of the dial.
01:48:31.02 --> 01:48:36.54 Then graze weapon opened up on the right, firing back into the rooms of the houses
01:48:36.54 --> 01:48:41.42 more in the hope of distracting the enemy than providing covering fire.
01:48:41.42 --> 01:48:46.90 The danger to John's men lay on the other side, the front of the houses.
01:48:46.90 --> 01:48:52.34 Now John's three-bremned guns were firing as well on the left.
01:48:52.34 --> 01:48:57.30 The assault party would soon be moving into the street.
01:48:57.30 --> 01:48:59.58 It came.
01:48:59.58 --> 01:49:03.22 The sustained rattle of a spandown gun.
01:49:03.22 --> 01:49:06.58 Just one, then a second.
01:49:06.58 --> 01:49:12.62 After that there was silence, except for one or two rifle shots.
01:49:12.62 --> 01:49:19.34 I waited, lying in the vegetable patch almost to straw with worry.
01:49:19.34 --> 01:49:20.90 Something was badly wrong.
01:49:20.90 --> 01:49:24.74 Nothing could be seen from here, but I had to resist the temptation of going to find out
01:49:24.74 --> 01:49:26.42 for myself what had happened.
01:49:26.42 --> 01:49:31.18 I must avoid getting involved in the skirmish.
01:49:31.18 --> 01:49:35.74 Then corporal day, now John's second in command was running through the flower beds toward
01:49:35.74 --> 01:49:37.74 me.
01:49:37.74 --> 01:49:43.02 Days face said everything, even before he started to speak.
01:49:43.02 --> 01:49:45.18 The attack had failed.
01:49:45.18 --> 01:49:49.58 It had failed the moment John had been killed, out there in the middle of the street, and
01:49:49.58 --> 01:49:55.10 ten yards in front of day, and the rest of the assault party John had died in just the same
01:49:55.10 --> 01:50:00.14 way as that young German officer this morning.
01:50:00.14 --> 01:50:02.58 And he had finished it.
01:50:02.58 --> 01:50:09.02 The rest of them, including day, had turned and run, but in some extraordinary way no one
01:50:09.02 --> 01:50:12.22 else had been hit.
01:50:12.22 --> 01:50:18.34 Day made no excuse, no attempt to excuse himself, telling the story factually and not trying
01:50:18.34 --> 01:50:21.42 to put a gloss on the incident.
01:50:21.42 --> 01:50:29.34 The implication was clear they had been asked to do too much.
01:50:29.34 --> 01:50:34.50 So now I had been responsible for killing John as well.
01:50:34.50 --> 01:50:36.02 It had been so simple.
01:50:36.02 --> 01:50:39.94 I had issued the orders, and then John had walked out into the middle of that road to
01:50:39.94 --> 01:50:45.06 be shot down by the machine gun.
01:50:45.06 --> 01:50:48.46 I should not have done it.
01:50:48.46 --> 01:50:51.94 The counterattacks should never have been attempted.
01:50:51.94 --> 01:50:56.54 The men were no longer capable of making such an effort.
01:50:56.54 --> 01:51:00.86 They could still hang onto their positions, fighting from behind cover, but after six days
01:51:00.86 --> 01:51:07.50 of continuous battle, they lacked the will to get to their feet and go for the enemy.
01:51:07.50 --> 01:51:12.94 In the woods, it had just been possible to urge them forward in one last surge of willpower,
01:51:12.94 --> 01:51:22.58 but since then, they'd endured a further 48 hours of death, starvation, thirst, and fatigue.
01:51:22.58 --> 01:51:27.38 In the woods, it was men from my own company, today it had been different.
01:51:27.38 --> 01:51:32.42 Today a mixture of men, survivors of four different companies, had been left to follow a gunner
01:51:32.42 --> 01:51:36.70 officer whom they hardly knew.
01:51:36.70 --> 01:51:41.14 There was a limit to what soldiers could be asked to do, and I had gone beyond those
01:51:41.14 --> 01:51:44.98 limits.
01:51:44.98 --> 01:52:03.98 And so John Simmons had died.
01:52:03.98 --> 01:52:10.82 That's the burden of command.
01:52:10.82 --> 01:52:12.86 Back to the book.
01:52:12.86 --> 01:52:16.78 It was impossible to understand why the Germans were not using their armor to support this
01:52:16.78 --> 01:52:19.34 infiltration by their infantry.
01:52:19.34 --> 01:52:23.62 If they had done so, all resistance would have collapsed long ago, and the tanks would
01:52:23.62 --> 01:52:27.42 have been on the lawns.
01:52:27.42 --> 01:52:31.18 The crushing news that the brigadier had been badly wounded came through on the telephone
01:52:31.18 --> 01:52:34.94 just before the line went dead once again.
01:52:34.94 --> 01:52:39.74 The bush were now among the houses and gardens, which the glider pilots had been holding,
01:52:39.74 --> 01:52:46.30 and gray had reported that he was being shot at from two sides at the same time.
01:52:46.30 --> 01:52:52.18 The quartermaster had also sent word that the enemy were behind him, and that he had
01:52:52.18 --> 01:53:04.66 long ago lost all contact with the rekiyon as left.
01:53:04.66 --> 01:53:11.06 They are just in a wretched state, and he goes to meet with the colonel in one of the
01:53:11.06 --> 01:53:12.22 buildings.
01:53:12.22 --> 01:53:16.98 The colonel seemed to be trying to break something to us gently.
01:53:16.98 --> 01:53:18.74 Then it came out.
01:53:18.74 --> 01:53:22.90 It was hard to believe, harder still to understand.
01:53:22.90 --> 01:53:27.90 The division was to be withdrawn over the line that night.
01:53:27.90 --> 01:53:30.46 It was all over.
01:53:30.46 --> 01:53:35.22 It had been. It had only been possible to ferry about 250 men of the door sits over the
01:53:35.22 --> 01:53:40.50 river before dawn, a profitless addition to the perimeter garrison.
01:53:40.50 --> 01:53:44.58 The second army had overreached itself and trying to get to us, and although the troops
01:53:44.58 --> 01:53:48.90 were purporting northward, they lacked the strength across the river and continued the
01:53:48.90 --> 01:53:51.98 advance into Germany.
01:53:51.98 --> 01:53:59.10 Already the bush were hammering from the flanks at their narrow lines of communication.
01:53:59.10 --> 01:54:03.86 The operation had failed.
01:54:03.86 --> 01:54:06.50 Everything had been in vain.
01:54:06.50 --> 01:54:10.38 It was all a waste.
01:54:10.38 --> 01:54:13.62 Listening to the outline of what had to be done that night, it was hard to concentrate
01:54:13.62 --> 01:54:16.26 on the details.
01:54:16.26 --> 01:54:19.62 The first emotion was grief.
01:54:19.62 --> 01:54:33.70 And then utter disappointment.
01:54:33.70 --> 01:54:34.34 The battalion had been destroyed to no purpose.
01:54:34.34 --> 01:54:35.34 And that's it.
01:54:35.34 --> 01:54:37.18 They get the order.
01:54:37.18 --> 01:54:40.58 That night to leave.
01:54:40.58 --> 01:54:43.06 And they come up with a plan.
01:54:43.06 --> 01:54:45.54 They actually follow rope.
01:54:45.54 --> 01:54:49.58 They put rope at night down towards the river where they're going to get extracted.
01:54:49.58 --> 01:54:53.42 And at night they attempt to follow that rope down there.
01:54:53.42 --> 01:54:56.30 And of course, along the way, they lose more men.
01:54:56.30 --> 01:54:57.66 Men get separated.
01:54:57.66 --> 01:54:58.66 Men don't hang on.
01:54:58.66 --> 01:54:59.94 They get lost.
01:54:59.94 --> 01:55:04.46 And they lose even more men as they're trying to make it to their extraction point.
01:55:04.46 --> 01:55:08.54 But he does end up with a small group of people at this extraction point.
01:55:08.54 --> 01:55:14.02 There's Canadian boats there to bring them across the Rhine River.
01:55:14.02 --> 01:55:17.82 Back to the book, the Canadians were already pulling the last men into the boat.
01:55:17.82 --> 01:55:21.18 And I was standing with Harrison, alone in the river.
01:55:21.18 --> 01:55:27.38 When I heard a winers' voice, harshly insisting that no one would be left behind.
01:55:27.38 --> 01:55:31.06 The young cockson needed no further urging but importers to be careful as the boat was
01:55:31.06 --> 01:55:33.82 grossly overloaded.
01:55:33.82 --> 01:55:38.62 Then Harrison pushed me up over the side and the two of us flopped down behind the cockson
01:55:38.62 --> 01:55:42.86 as the engine went into gear and the boat moved towards midstream.
01:55:42.86 --> 01:55:50.78 So now they get across the river, they get dropped off and to answer your question earlier.
01:55:50.78 --> 01:55:55.14 Once they get dropped off on the other side, they're on the western side of the Rhine River,
01:55:55.14 --> 01:55:58.26 it's basically secure area.
01:55:58.26 --> 01:56:04.46 Even though it was only several hundred yards away, it was relatively secure.
01:56:04.46 --> 01:56:10.22 And now what they have to do is they have to march back about five miles to get to even
01:56:10.22 --> 01:56:12.98 more secure base.
01:56:12.98 --> 01:56:13.98 Here we go back to the book.
01:56:13.98 --> 01:56:19.46 As we reach the track, which after a few hundred yards led us to the road, when I stopped
01:56:19.46 --> 01:56:25.98 the men flopped to the ground empty and lifeless, lacking any wish to go on.
01:56:25.98 --> 01:56:30.86 More parties have men appeared through the darkness, shambling in the exhaustion of relief,
01:56:30.86 --> 01:56:36.98 alter-ended, devoid of the willpower needed to summon up further effort.
01:56:36.98 --> 01:56:42.58 There's only one way to make the two mile march bearable and old fashioned remedy.
01:56:42.58 --> 01:56:47.58 I called the Sergeant Weiner to fall the men in threes.
01:56:47.58 --> 01:56:51.70 The discipline bark bounced back to me as Weiner pulled himself to his feet shouting
01:56:51.70 --> 01:56:53.90 to the men to fall in.
01:56:53.90 --> 01:57:01.34 There is no trace of query or surprise in Weiner's voice and the men shuffled to their feet.
01:57:01.34 --> 01:57:04.42 That's your route training right there.
01:57:04.42 --> 01:57:07.86 You're exhausted after eight days of continuous combat.
01:57:07.86 --> 01:57:14.18 You're just done and the Sergeant says, all right, on your feet, form a column of threes
01:57:14.18 --> 01:57:18.22 and you do it.
01:57:18.22 --> 01:57:20.82 There get close to the end.
01:57:20.82 --> 01:57:24.70 I'm now that I can see the camp and I halted them.
01:57:24.70 --> 01:57:27.18 There was only one way to end such a march.
01:57:27.18 --> 01:57:31.50 It was pointless perhaps, but I decided to make the final gesture.
01:57:31.50 --> 01:57:38.38 Knowing them to attention, I ordered them to slope arms and to march by the left to attention.
01:57:38.38 --> 01:57:42.94 I sensed their appreciation as their shoulders went back.
01:57:42.94 --> 01:57:45.62 This was the way they always returned to camp.
01:57:45.62 --> 01:57:48.10 This was the way they always finished.
01:57:48.10 --> 01:57:55.42 As they stepped off for the last 50 yards, they were even squinging their arms.
01:57:55.42 --> 01:58:00.22 They marched back into this camp once they get into this camp, they get loaded up into
01:58:00.22 --> 01:58:05.02 a vehicle, a big military transport vehicle that's going to take them further to the rear
01:58:05.02 --> 01:58:12.66 where they can get some treatment and they're loaded into that vehicle.
01:58:12.66 --> 01:58:16.98 Here we go back to the book, the canopy of the truck now sheltered us, but my shivering
01:58:16.98 --> 01:58:19.50 became uncontrollable.
01:58:19.50 --> 01:58:24.18 I knew I was becoming light headed and could hear myself grieving aloud for those that
01:58:24.18 --> 01:58:28.58 we had left behind, particularly for those who had been lost during the withdrawal down
01:58:28.58 --> 01:58:31.42 the riverbank.
01:58:31.42 --> 01:58:34.34 There was silence in the truck.
01:58:34.34 --> 01:58:39.86 Then I heard, as if from a long way off, the voice of Sergeant Weiner, Client, Calm
01:58:39.86 --> 01:58:46.82 and Flat, saying that none of them would have got back if it had not been for me.
01:58:46.82 --> 01:58:51.66 It was true to say that I would never have got back if it hadn't been for them, but
01:58:51.66 --> 01:58:58.26 I shall always be grateful to Weiner for having said it.
01:58:58.26 --> 01:59:03.74 The next thing I remember was Weiner and Harrison, half carrying me into what seemed to
01:59:03.74 --> 01:59:06.50 be a hospital.
01:59:06.50 --> 01:59:12.54 Someone was stripping off my clothes and dressing me in pajamas, then I felt the prick of
01:59:12.54 --> 01:59:17.70 a needle in my arm.
01:59:17.70 --> 01:59:20.58 I was awake.
01:59:20.58 --> 01:59:25.14 The sun shining into the windows of the ward.
01:59:25.14 --> 01:59:29.90 And orderly brought tea and food on a tray, I lay between the clean sheets, looking at
01:59:29.90 --> 01:59:35.14 the torn and filthy garments on the chair by the side of the bed.
01:59:35.14 --> 01:59:38.10 There was nothing wrong with me now.
01:59:38.10 --> 01:59:42.74 I saw that my hand was wrapped in a clean bandage.
01:59:42.74 --> 01:59:46.90 When the nursing orderly came to remove the tray, he brought me the message that a soldier
01:59:46.90 --> 01:59:50.82 was waiting in the corridor to see me.
01:59:50.82 --> 01:59:54.94 As soon as the orderly left, the room I slipped out of bed and put on my clothes and went
01:59:54.94 --> 01:59:58.18 out in the corridor.
01:59:58.18 --> 02:00:02.78 Waiting there was Harrison, a broad smile on his face, telling me that Captain Gray
02:00:02.78 --> 02:00:06.94 and Mr. Elkins and turned up with aid to the missing men.
02:00:06.94 --> 02:00:12.58 Another 20 stragglers had also arrived from somewhere or another.
02:00:12.58 --> 02:00:15.34 But that was the lot.
02:00:15.34 --> 02:00:18.10 That was the battalion.
02:00:18.10 --> 02:00:25.22 Three officers and 43 soldiers.
02:00:25.22 --> 02:00:33.46 We walked out the door of the hospital side, side by side.
02:00:33.46 --> 02:00:39.10 The week's September sun shone down on the battered buildings.
02:00:39.10 --> 02:00:48.06 Away in the distance, the dull rumble of the battle still rolled down from the north.
02:00:48.06 --> 02:01:07.82 And once all the men were recovered, and that's the end of the book.
02:01:07.82 --> 02:01:12.86 When all the men were recovered, and when you look at the actual battalion of the 156 pairs,
02:01:12.86 --> 02:01:18.30 you battalion, it looked like this, 313 men were captured, many of those were wounded.
02:01:18.30 --> 02:01:24.22 There was 98 killed in action, and there was a total of 68 from the battalion that
02:01:24.22 --> 02:01:28.38 made it across the Rhine safely.
02:01:28.38 --> 02:01:36.22 And those 68 men, if they could heal up, were then sent to the other battalions inside
02:01:36.22 --> 02:01:39.62 the first parabirdade.
02:01:39.62 --> 02:01:46.86 And the 156th parachute battalion was actually disbanded.
02:01:46.86 --> 02:01:51.70 It ceased to exist.
02:01:51.70 --> 02:02:00.14 Jeffree Powell went on to retire from the Army, the British Army in 1964.
02:02:00.14 --> 02:02:02.94 He retired as a major general.
02:02:02.94 --> 02:02:10.54 He was awarded the military cross, which is Britain's third highest award for valor.
02:02:10.54 --> 02:02:14.46 And this is what his citation reads.
02:02:14.46 --> 02:02:19.62 At Arnum after his commanding officer had become a casualty, major pal took command of the remnants
02:02:19.62 --> 02:02:21.18 of the battalion.
02:02:21.18 --> 02:02:24.98 Up to this time, he conducted himself with the greatest gallantry.
02:02:24.98 --> 02:02:30.02 For the remaining six days, he retained control of his unit, and also of the men of other
02:02:30.02 --> 02:02:35.62 units in the area under the most difficult conditions.
02:02:35.62 --> 02:02:40.98 Heavy fire for mortars artillery and self-propelled guns never stopped his activity in
02:02:40.98 --> 02:02:48.26 getting round his section of the perimeter and encouraging his men to greater efforts.
02:02:48.26 --> 02:02:54.02 Throughout the whole period of the Arnum battle, in spite of being wounded, this officer showed
02:02:54.02 --> 02:02:59.18 himself to be a gallant leader of men and the most capable fighter and one whose bravery
02:02:59.18 --> 02:03:13.94 was a source of inspiration to the men under his command and to all those around him.
02:03:13.94 --> 02:03:22.42 And I think it's pretty clear that if you read a book like this, General Powell is still
02:03:22.42 --> 02:03:32.78 a source of inspiration as are the rest of these incredibly brave men and also a source
02:03:32.78 --> 02:03:46.22 of leadership lessons of what to do and what not to do, and it's also an incredible reminder
02:03:46.22 --> 02:03:53.22 of that heavy burden of command.
02:03:53.22 --> 02:04:00.54 And the fact of the matter is when you lead you own every decision and every action not only
02:04:00.54 --> 02:04:08.54 of yourself but of your men.
02:04:08.54 --> 02:04:18.38 And with that burden, you owe it to them to be as well prepared, to be as tactically
02:04:18.38 --> 02:04:29.06 sound and to be as physically and mentally strong as you can possibly be.
02:04:29.06 --> 02:04:35.42 And that goes for any leadership position when you are a leader, be as prepared as you
02:04:35.42 --> 02:04:40.90 possibly can.
02:04:40.90 --> 02:04:46.62 And then you go out and you lead and you lead with courage and you lead with resolution
02:04:46.62 --> 02:04:54.62 and you lead with boldness.
02:04:54.62 --> 02:05:05.34 Boldness like Jeffrey Bell, then the officers in the men of the 156th Parishute Battalion.
02:05:05.34 --> 02:05:20.02 Pretty amazing book that, you know, like I said, I got this book six days ago or something.
02:05:20.02 --> 02:05:26.18 Somebody just sent it to me and I gave it the little tests, what I kind of opened books
02:05:26.18 --> 02:05:31.50 up because people saw me a lot of books and I gave it the test, you know, I opened
02:05:31.50 --> 02:05:36.34 up by read a couple of sections and it immediately, you know, I'll give all open to a book
02:05:36.34 --> 02:05:41.34 in four or five different places to see what it reads like.
02:05:41.34 --> 02:05:46.42 And this, you know, within the first page, the first page that I read is that, oh, we
02:05:46.42 --> 02:05:48.30 it looks like we have a winner here.
02:05:48.30 --> 02:05:57.62 This one's going to be on the podcast because it's just impactful and the account now.
02:05:57.62 --> 02:06:04.46 In the back of the book, he talks about the, the individuals and it just reads some
02:06:04.46 --> 02:06:05.78 of them off here.
02:06:05.78 --> 02:06:12.94 The Brigadier was General John Hackett.
02:06:12.94 --> 02:06:19.26 The Colonel was Dickie DeVo of the Grenadier Guards.
02:06:19.26 --> 02:06:26.06 His fellow Grenadier was Surgeon Major Dennis Gay.
02:06:26.06 --> 02:06:29.98 His Batman, the guy that he talks about Harrison throughout the book, the guy that's
02:06:29.98 --> 02:06:33.06 there from the beginning to the end, always by the side that was actually a guy named Fred
02:06:33.06 --> 02:06:34.06 Tracy.
02:06:34.06 --> 02:06:38.54 The guy named David N. unwitting the book is the character in the book.
02:06:38.54 --> 02:06:47.18 The real guy was named Michael Page who had been Powell's best man and who's son, Jeffrey
02:06:47.18 --> 02:06:57.28 born posthumously had another son named Michael and Luke Tyler and Sergeant Wyner and
02:06:57.28 --> 02:07:01.42 Jones and Johnson as these were all real people.
02:07:01.42 --> 02:07:08.38 So, you know, this is another guy that very similar to Major John Glover who said he had
02:07:08.38 --> 02:07:11.30 a hard time writing about himself in the first person.
02:07:11.30 --> 02:07:12.74 You know, I did this and I did that.
02:07:12.74 --> 02:07:14.18 That's the same thing that Powell said.
02:07:14.18 --> 02:07:18.02 You know, he had a hard time writing until he just made it about some other, he put made
02:07:18.02 --> 02:07:22.46 some other character in his hand and wrote from that perspective.
02:07:22.46 --> 02:07:31.46 But, man, you definitely this book, like I said, I read, I don't know, 5% of it.
02:07:31.46 --> 02:07:33.46 It's not a huge book though, actually.
02:07:33.46 --> 02:07:37.78 It's only a couple hundred pages long and it's a very fast read.
02:07:37.78 --> 02:07:42.02 Did you find it to give you this weird stressful feeling reading, no?
02:07:42.02 --> 02:07:43.02 Absolutely.
02:07:43.02 --> 02:07:45.02 It's interesting too, it's like just more stressful.
02:07:45.02 --> 02:07:46.02 It is stressful.
02:07:46.02 --> 02:07:47.02 It is.
02:07:47.02 --> 02:07:53.58 And I was debating when to tell you and when to tell everyone that this is not a good, that
02:07:53.58 --> 02:07:55.14 this is a good story, right?
02:07:55.14 --> 02:07:57.50 This isn't a positive thing.
02:07:57.50 --> 02:08:02.30 And I kind of just, I don't know, when I actually said that, hey, they're not going to
02:08:02.30 --> 02:08:03.30 win.
02:08:03.30 --> 02:08:06.86 I mean, I said that the operation market garden was a failure.
02:08:06.86 --> 02:08:08.50 But, you know, what does that really look like?
02:08:08.50 --> 02:08:09.50 You know what I mean?
02:08:09.50 --> 02:08:12.30 Like, you don't know what that looks like until you get reading this book and then you
02:08:12.30 --> 02:08:13.30 start to feel what it feels like.
02:08:13.30 --> 02:08:14.90 It absolutely.
02:08:14.90 --> 02:08:19.62 And when you read the whole book, man, it is just coming apart.
02:08:19.62 --> 02:08:23.74 It's just a little misfortune, a little misfortune, they're just coming and they don't
02:08:23.74 --> 02:08:24.74 stop.
02:08:24.74 --> 02:08:26.38 They just don't stop.
02:08:26.38 --> 02:08:29.54 It's a nightmare scenario.
02:08:29.54 --> 02:08:32.54 And yeah, and there's tons of great lessons learned.
02:08:32.54 --> 02:08:33.54 It's so amazing.
02:08:33.54 --> 02:08:34.54 Because I never read this book before.
02:08:34.54 --> 02:08:35.94 I just got it.
02:08:35.94 --> 02:08:37.22 But it's amazing.
02:08:37.22 --> 02:08:38.22 Covered move.
02:08:38.22 --> 02:08:39.22 Yeah.
02:08:39.22 --> 02:08:40.22 Decentualized command.
02:08:40.22 --> 02:08:41.22 Yeah.
02:08:41.22 --> 02:08:42.22 That's cute.
02:08:42.22 --> 02:08:44.98 Even that part when you're keeping it simple.
02:08:44.98 --> 02:08:52.94 Everything that we learned, I should have learned this years ago.
02:08:52.94 --> 02:08:57.46 And when I think about, you know, I was, you look back at your life, right?
02:08:57.46 --> 02:08:59.10 And you say to yourself, what could I have done better?
02:08:59.10 --> 02:09:00.82 What could I do different?
02:09:00.82 --> 02:09:04.74 And, you know, everyone in the SEAL teams, like basically you get one shot at each
02:09:04.74 --> 02:09:05.74 job.
02:09:05.74 --> 02:09:10.34 Other than just being a shooter and a platoon, that you can do three or four times.
02:09:10.34 --> 02:09:12.86 If you're lucky.
02:09:12.86 --> 02:09:16.58 But then once you get into a leadership position, you're like you're an assistant platoon
02:09:16.58 --> 02:09:17.58 commander.
02:09:17.58 --> 02:09:18.58 You do that one time.
02:09:18.58 --> 02:09:19.82 Then you're a platoon commander.
02:09:19.82 --> 02:09:21.02 You do that one time.
02:09:21.02 --> 02:09:22.18 Then you're a task unit commander.
02:09:22.18 --> 02:09:23.18 You do that one time.
02:09:23.18 --> 02:09:28.10 Generally, sometimes the guys rarely guys do more than one of those.
02:09:28.10 --> 02:09:29.38 Same thing on the enlisted side.
02:09:29.38 --> 02:09:32.10 Guy gets to do an a leading pedigoster.
02:09:32.10 --> 02:09:33.34 Does that one time?
02:09:33.34 --> 02:09:34.86 Chief pedigoster of a platoon.
02:09:34.86 --> 02:09:37.46 Platoon chief does that one time.
02:09:37.46 --> 02:09:42.46 You don't get to repeat the jobs.
02:09:42.46 --> 02:09:46.86 And so basically when you're finally getting good at your job, you're done.
02:09:46.86 --> 02:09:49.94 And now you've got to go get the next job up the chain of command.
02:09:49.94 --> 02:09:56.74 So for me, it was always, and now looking back and even talking to my SEAL buddies now,
02:09:56.74 --> 02:09:58.74 like how can we prepare them better?
02:09:58.74 --> 02:10:03.58 So they know what we had to learn during the job.
02:10:03.58 --> 02:10:07.38 It's a hard thing to do because a lot of stuff you actually have to learn from
02:10:07.38 --> 02:10:08.38 experience.
02:10:08.38 --> 02:10:09.38 Yeah.
02:10:09.38 --> 02:10:14.10 And actually we talked about that at the last master, which is that was a big part that
02:10:14.10 --> 02:10:15.10 we talked about.
02:10:15.10 --> 02:10:18.18 If you're going to get good at something, you have two choices.
02:10:18.18 --> 02:10:20.26 Experience or training.
02:10:20.26 --> 02:10:24.22 And training is a way to condense experience down and distill it.
02:10:24.22 --> 02:10:28.46 That's what was great about when I was running training on the West Coast.
02:10:28.46 --> 02:10:31.46 We got to really condense that experience.
02:10:31.46 --> 02:10:32.46 Sure.
02:10:32.46 --> 02:10:36.74 I mean, guys went through, guys went through hellacious training.
02:10:36.74 --> 02:10:39.34 And we provide total chaos for them.
02:10:39.34 --> 02:10:44.26 That most guys wouldn't experience that kind of chaos in their whole career or in 10 careers.
02:10:44.26 --> 02:10:47.94 But they would get it and they would get pushed to the parts that when they got out of
02:10:47.94 --> 02:10:51.18 the battlefield, they were ready for the chaos that was out there.
02:10:51.18 --> 02:10:55.54 Because we trained them and we pushed them further and harder during training.
02:10:55.54 --> 02:10:58.26 Then we hoped they would get pushed on the battlefield.
02:10:58.26 --> 02:10:59.26 Yeah.
02:10:59.26 --> 02:11:00.26 It's crazy.
02:11:00.26 --> 02:11:02.62 Even that cover and move even when they're retreating.
02:11:02.62 --> 02:11:06.70 It's like it showed like how you got to keep that discipline with that.
02:11:06.70 --> 02:11:10.22 It's kind of like, you know, like an MMA fighter or something.
02:11:10.22 --> 02:11:16.34 And the guy starts getting hit on the inside and rather than still covering up a little
02:11:16.34 --> 02:11:19.66 bit while he goes back, he runs away or turns his back or something like that.
02:11:19.66 --> 02:11:20.66 Turn your back a bit.
02:11:20.66 --> 02:11:21.66 Yeah.
02:11:21.66 --> 02:11:24.06 Turn your back and your done.
02:11:24.06 --> 02:11:25.06 But great book.
02:11:25.06 --> 02:11:28.62 I definitely recommend it for your beating list.
02:11:28.62 --> 02:11:29.62 Yeah.
02:11:29.62 --> 02:11:33.14 There was that part in there that the guy came up to.
02:11:33.14 --> 02:11:35.02 I think reload ammo or something.
02:11:35.02 --> 02:11:37.02 And the guy's sitting there.
02:11:37.02 --> 02:11:38.02 Yeah.
02:11:38.02 --> 02:11:39.02 And he's doing.
02:11:39.02 --> 02:11:41.02 So he gets like scolded or whatever.
02:11:41.02 --> 02:11:43.66 He turns out he's wounded or he's injured.
02:11:43.66 --> 02:11:46.74 That was an interesting little lesson there.
02:11:46.74 --> 02:11:47.74 You just don't know.
02:11:47.74 --> 02:11:49.74 So you can't just start going off.
02:11:49.74 --> 02:11:50.74 Totally true.
02:11:50.74 --> 02:11:56.30 And I don't know if you remember somebody asked us a question one time about how do I
02:11:56.30 --> 02:11:59.06 these people that have had everything given to them.
02:11:59.06 --> 02:12:02.34 And I've had a, I grew up in a tough neighborhood.
02:12:02.34 --> 02:12:05.18 I was like, oh, you actually don't know what that person's been through.
02:12:05.18 --> 02:12:06.18 And we had that whole discussion.
02:12:06.18 --> 02:12:07.18 Yeah.
02:12:07.18 --> 02:12:10.62 That's the same thing true on a day to day basis with every other human being that you're
02:12:10.62 --> 02:12:11.62 dealing with.
02:12:11.62 --> 02:12:12.62 You don't know what they're going through.
02:12:12.62 --> 02:12:15.74 You don't know what triumphs and tragedies they've had in their life.
02:12:15.74 --> 02:12:18.18 You don't know what just happened to them this morning.
02:12:18.18 --> 02:12:23.42 So the recommended course of action is you give someone a little bit of slack when we don't
02:12:23.42 --> 02:12:24.42 know them.
02:12:24.42 --> 02:12:25.42 You know?
02:12:25.42 --> 02:12:26.42 Yeah.
02:12:26.42 --> 02:12:29.02 You've seen that at St. Philippe when he goes to talk to the girl.
02:12:29.02 --> 02:12:30.02 Come on.
02:12:30.02 --> 02:12:33.70 He's actually, he was pretty much this, but just on science field.
02:12:33.70 --> 02:12:34.82 So he goes to talk to the screen.
02:12:34.82 --> 02:12:36.22 He's like, I got to talk to that girl.
02:12:36.22 --> 02:12:38.02 She's hot or whatever.
02:12:38.02 --> 02:12:40.78 He goes up, turn you and he's like, hey, hello.
02:12:40.78 --> 02:12:41.78 Excuse me.
02:12:41.78 --> 02:12:42.78 Her back is kind of turned.
02:12:42.78 --> 02:12:44.10 He's like, excuse me.
02:12:44.10 --> 02:12:45.10 Hello, hello.
02:12:45.10 --> 02:12:48.86 Like, getting any starts to get real mad that she's not listening to him.
02:12:48.86 --> 02:12:52.42 Finally he walks it like more close to her and she kind of starts to turn around and
02:12:52.42 --> 02:12:54.26 he's like, oh, so now you pay attention.
02:12:54.26 --> 02:12:55.26 What do you deaf?
02:12:55.26 --> 02:12:57.50 And she's like, bingo like science tool.
02:12:57.50 --> 02:12:58.50 Oh.
02:12:58.50 --> 02:12:59.50 She is deaf.
02:12:59.50 --> 02:13:00.50 Yeah.
02:13:00.50 --> 02:13:01.54 You know, they got to chill out.
02:13:01.54 --> 02:13:02.54 Yeah.
02:13:02.54 --> 02:13:03.94 Find out about people first.
02:13:03.94 --> 02:13:04.94 Free start.
02:13:04.94 --> 02:13:09.70 Make sure they make sure the regimental sergeant major isn't wounded in both legs before
02:13:09.70 --> 02:13:10.90 you start dressing him down.
02:13:10.90 --> 02:13:11.90 I know.
02:13:11.90 --> 02:13:12.90 Yeah, man.
02:13:12.90 --> 02:13:15.38 That's a good thing.
02:13:15.38 --> 02:13:16.38 He put that in this book.
02:13:16.38 --> 02:13:17.38 You know, that's pretty humble.
02:13:17.38 --> 02:13:18.38 Yeah.
02:13:18.38 --> 02:13:19.38 Firm to put this in this book.
02:13:19.38 --> 02:13:20.78 You know what I mean?
02:13:20.78 --> 02:13:21.78 Yep.
02:13:21.78 --> 02:13:27.54 And that other part where they were all what, like tired and stuff, right?
02:13:27.54 --> 02:13:29.18 Or they're defeated, essentially.
02:13:29.18 --> 02:13:32.70 They were actually, you mean when they were basically broken men?
02:13:32.70 --> 02:13:33.70 Yeah.
02:13:33.70 --> 02:13:36.10 And then they got up and they just started charging getting into it.
02:13:36.10 --> 02:13:37.10 Yeah.
02:13:37.10 --> 02:13:38.10 Default aggressive.
02:13:38.10 --> 02:13:40.10 Default aggressive part.
02:13:40.10 --> 02:13:45.26 That's like, like, in why there's big synopids.
02:13:45.26 --> 02:13:46.26 10.
02:13:46.26 --> 02:13:50.50 They're like, they're kind of bigger than like a few long.
02:13:50.50 --> 02:13:51.50 No, no.
02:13:51.50 --> 02:13:53.94 They're bigger than like synopids that I've seen here.
02:13:53.94 --> 02:13:54.94 Okay.
02:13:54.94 --> 02:13:55.94 Give me a figure.
02:13:55.94 --> 02:13:56.94 Like six inches.
02:13:56.94 --> 02:14:00.42 It's like six is like a normal big synopids.
02:14:00.42 --> 02:14:01.42 Okay.
02:14:01.42 --> 02:14:03.26 And they still get bigger.
02:14:03.26 --> 02:14:07.34 Anyway, they're, I mean compared to you, you know, that they're, they're little
02:14:07.34 --> 02:14:08.66 bucks, they're little whatever.
02:14:08.66 --> 02:14:10.14 And you just step on it.
02:14:10.14 --> 02:14:13.86 But like when you start messing with it and it starts to get nuts, it's super
02:14:13.86 --> 02:14:14.86 entertaining.
02:14:14.86 --> 02:14:17.18 I'm just saying that they're cheating like that.
02:14:17.18 --> 02:14:20.46 I don't know, but they can chase you out of your room.
02:14:20.46 --> 02:14:21.94 You got chased out of your room by a certain thing.
02:14:21.94 --> 02:14:25.78 Well, anything like, even like a, like a wasp or you know, like with these little things
02:14:25.78 --> 02:14:27.18 that are way smaller than you.
02:14:27.18 --> 02:14:28.34 And they just get nuts.
02:14:28.34 --> 02:14:29.86 And then, like you don't want to mess with it.
02:14:29.86 --> 02:14:34.06 You know, so life, life was over my house as a while ago, a couple of years ago.
02:14:34.06 --> 02:14:37.46 And there was a lizard in my house.
02:14:37.46 --> 02:14:41.34 Like about a, yeah, thought a nine inch lizard.
02:14:41.34 --> 02:14:46.02 And so my son and life are going to try and catch this lizard.
02:14:46.02 --> 02:14:48.02 And they're being weak.
02:14:48.02 --> 02:14:50.78 Do like, yeah, they're like, oh, you know,
02:14:50.78 --> 02:14:52.54 they're like, oh, wait, wait, no, grab it.
02:14:52.54 --> 02:14:53.98 Get a box on it and all.
02:14:53.98 --> 02:14:55.94 So I come in, Mr. Tuff guy.
02:14:55.94 --> 02:14:59.54 You know, I come in reached, I go, just grab that thing.
02:14:59.54 --> 02:15:01.38 You will seize reach down.
02:15:01.38 --> 02:15:02.62 I reached down a grab this thing.
02:15:02.62 --> 02:15:05.42 This thing turns its head and bites.
02:15:05.42 --> 02:15:08.90 Yeah, so it's a nice screen.
02:15:08.90 --> 02:15:12.50 Like, like the Jim Carrey, like, oh, yeah.
02:15:12.50 --> 02:15:13.62 And I flipped my hand.
02:15:13.62 --> 02:15:18.98 It was, it was absolutely hilarious because I went from being a big tough guy to screaming.
02:15:18.98 --> 02:15:22.74 Oh, and having a lizard bit onto my finger.
02:15:22.74 --> 02:15:25.94 Good blood. By the way, yeah, this thing drew blood.
02:15:25.94 --> 02:15:27.74 Yeah, on my thumb.
02:15:27.74 --> 02:15:30.50 So yeah, I was default aggressive, but it didn't work out.
02:15:30.50 --> 02:15:33.34 The lizard was more default aggressive than I was.
02:15:33.34 --> 02:15:35.22 Yeah, see, and that is funny.
02:15:35.22 --> 02:15:37.82 That's a funny story for a couple of reasons, in my opinion.
02:15:37.82 --> 02:15:40.98 But that is the exact same concept, though.
02:15:40.98 --> 02:15:43.38 Where if you would like, like, how you said in the book,
02:15:43.38 --> 02:15:45.82 just kept your head, you smash that lizard.
02:15:45.82 --> 02:15:47.54 That is what if I wanted to catch a live,
02:15:47.54 --> 02:15:48.98 I wasn't trying to kill it.
02:15:48.98 --> 02:15:49.82 Yeah.
02:15:49.82 --> 02:15:50.94 But still, I should have been more aggressive.
02:15:50.94 --> 02:15:53.34 The bite didn't even hurt, right?
02:15:53.34 --> 02:15:54.50 I just shocked me.
02:15:54.50 --> 02:15:55.70 Yeah, it just shocked me.
02:15:55.70 --> 02:15:56.90 That was pretty broad.
02:15:56.90 --> 02:15:59.70 Yeah, I wasn't ready for the, the gnashing of the teeth.
02:15:59.70 --> 02:16:00.70 Getting nuts, man.
02:16:00.70 --> 02:16:02.42 Yeah, those lizards, we have a lot of those.
02:16:02.42 --> 02:16:06.02 Especially when it gets hot, I mean, I'm assuming it's the same kind.
02:16:06.02 --> 02:16:09.34 There are these, but here's the thing, growing up on quite a disease thing.
02:16:09.34 --> 02:16:12.06 They call them, we call them convenience, but they're like,
02:16:12.06 --> 02:16:14.58 a null, a null, a, and a, oh,
02:16:14.58 --> 02:16:16.30 L, E, that's what you spent, spell it.
02:16:16.30 --> 02:16:18.82 They turn green or brown or whatever.
02:16:18.82 --> 02:16:22.02 When they get, they get pretty big and they're super aggressive.
02:16:22.02 --> 02:16:25.98 Like, when you grab them, oh, that's the first red thing comes out of their neck
02:16:25.98 --> 02:16:27.70 and they start biting you.
02:16:27.70 --> 02:16:31.94 And you get them to it when you hold them after a while they start to calm down.
02:16:31.94 --> 02:16:34.06 And I think they just start to get sick and stuff.
02:16:34.06 --> 02:16:36.06 I don't know, I don't know, but they calm down.
02:16:36.06 --> 02:16:38.14 So you can do this thing where basically it can.
02:16:38.14 --> 02:16:40.98 If you have a lizard's head, you go like this and he'll go like,
02:16:40.98 --> 02:16:42.26 they'll try to bite you.
02:16:42.26 --> 02:16:43.86 So what you do is when he calms down and I'm like,
02:16:43.86 --> 02:16:46.10 what a ray when you grab him, he's trying to kill you.
02:16:46.10 --> 02:16:49.70 But when he calms down after I don't know, three, four minutes, you do that
02:16:49.70 --> 02:16:53.66 and he'll kill, keep kind of like, how do you lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen
02:16:53.66 --> 02:16:56.90 he'll always do that though, but he'll just be a lot less aggressive.
02:16:56.90 --> 02:17:00.26 And then if you put your finger in his mouth, he'll bite you and he won't let go.
02:17:00.26 --> 02:17:03.14 So you got to kind of drag your finger out and yeah,
02:17:03.14 --> 02:17:05.10 it'll, it can cause blood or whatever.
02:17:05.10 --> 02:17:09.30 But what we do is, and you can proceed, let picture the,
02:17:09.30 --> 02:17:12.14 we do that and we put it on, put the lizard on our ears.
02:17:12.14 --> 02:17:14.42 So the lizard would be unhearing.
02:17:14.42 --> 02:17:17.86 And yeah, biting areas you'd have two lizards hanging down.
02:17:17.86 --> 02:17:19.30 But anyway, the point there being,
02:17:21.30 --> 02:17:25.46 fucking, so if you can keep your, yeah, when you grow up with that stuff,
02:17:25.46 --> 02:17:28.98 like those lizards are not scary, even if they're aggressive and some of them,
02:17:28.98 --> 02:17:31.94 they get pretty like big and bulky and they're like dang,
02:17:31.94 --> 02:17:34.74 a thing has some power to it, this little lizard, you know?
02:17:34.74 --> 02:17:39.14 And but even here, one, one, I grab them, they're like, oh no,
02:17:39.14 --> 02:17:42.10 I wouldn't scream like you, well, yeah, I'm just saying experience.
02:17:42.10 --> 02:17:46.34 And lizard got me dude, it was awful.
02:17:46.34 --> 02:17:51.86 It was awful. Well, being prepared, I guess is what we're talking about being aggressive.
02:17:51.86 --> 02:17:56.42 Once you get default aggressive with letting anybody know if they want to support this podcast,
02:17:56.42 --> 02:17:57.94 maybe how they could do it.
02:17:57.94 --> 02:18:01.78 Also support Jockel's traumatizing experience with lizards.
02:18:01.78 --> 02:18:02.50 With lizards.
02:18:02.50 --> 02:18:03.06 So bite it.
02:18:03.06 --> 02:18:04.66 It's fingers and him screaming.
02:18:04.66 --> 02:18:06.66 Oh, what's it, laughing?
02:18:06.66 --> 02:18:07.86 It was laughing my son.
02:18:07.86 --> 02:18:10.10 Yeah, did they lose respect for you that time?
02:18:10.10 --> 02:18:16.66 Well, it's actually funny because life always talks about, you know, me being calm.
02:18:16.66 --> 02:18:18.34 And that's why he laughed so hard.
02:18:18.34 --> 02:18:21.70 We were driving one time, we almost got into car wreck.
02:18:21.70 --> 02:18:22.90 He was driving actually.
02:18:22.90 --> 02:18:28.10 And I'll have him tell the story, but we hit mud and we hit, we were out in the desert.
02:18:28.10 --> 02:18:32.58 We were going for 65 miles an hour on a back road, back by all these farms.
02:18:33.62 --> 02:18:36.74 And it was two o'clock in the morning, three o'clock in the morning, something like that.
02:18:36.74 --> 02:18:40.02 And normally these roads are completely dry there in the desert.
02:18:40.58 --> 02:18:44.18 And we're hauling and life's driving, I think he's driving his truck.
02:18:44.18 --> 02:18:45.38 Yeah, he was driving his truck.
02:18:45.38 --> 02:18:53.06 We're hauling and all of a sudden out of nowhere, we see, we see a big 18 wheeler on the side of the road,
02:18:53.06 --> 02:18:55.06 on the opposite side of the road, but it's an arrow road.
02:18:55.06 --> 02:18:55.70 Yeah, yeah.
02:18:55.70 --> 02:19:01.94 And as we're hauling all of a sudden, we hit a water.
02:19:01.94 --> 02:19:05.62 Like a water probably a couple inches deep of water.
02:19:05.62 --> 02:19:07.86 Yeah, mud because it's what happened.
02:19:07.86 --> 02:19:12.50 Somewhere irrigation from all this farmland had broken and there was this flood.
02:19:13.22 --> 02:19:16.10 And so we hit this thing and we're immediately hydropel.
02:19:16.90 --> 02:19:18.90 And and life is from Texas.
02:19:18.90 --> 02:19:20.26 Life is from Texas.
02:19:20.26 --> 02:19:22.34 So he did not use to driving in the snow.
02:19:22.34 --> 02:19:23.94 I grew up driving in the snow in New England.
02:19:23.94 --> 02:19:25.30 You know, you just deal with it.
02:19:25.30 --> 02:19:26.90 Everyone's like a rally driver up there.
02:19:26.90 --> 02:19:27.94 Yeah, yeah, that's the thing.
02:19:27.94 --> 02:19:31.30 And so and so life, he's not really used to this.
02:19:31.30 --> 02:19:35.06 And he starts to oversteer the car, which is really, really bad.
02:19:35.06 --> 02:19:36.06 Yeah.
02:19:36.06 --> 02:19:37.78 And you know, I'm sitting there and we're going 65 miles an hour.
02:19:37.78 --> 02:19:40.26 He he he he he's Floody would he tells the story too.
02:19:40.26 --> 02:19:42.58 Because he's like we we thought we were going to die.
02:19:42.58 --> 02:19:44.18 He thought he's like we were definitely going to die.
02:19:44.18 --> 02:19:45.18 Yeah.
02:19:45.18 --> 02:19:48.18 And I'm sitting there in the passenger seat and I say, uh, don't oversteer.
02:19:48.18 --> 02:19:49.18 Don't oversteer.
02:19:49.18 --> 02:19:50.18 No breaks.
02:19:50.18 --> 02:19:51.18 No breaks.
02:19:51.18 --> 02:19:52.18 All right, you're good.
02:19:52.18 --> 02:19:53.18 Because that's the other thing mistake you can make.
02:19:53.18 --> 02:19:54.18 If you jam on the brakes.
02:19:54.18 --> 02:19:55.18 Yeah.
02:19:55.18 --> 02:19:56.82 You're going to lock it up and you're going to slide.
02:19:56.82 --> 02:19:58.18 You're going to lose control.
02:19:58.18 --> 02:19:59.38 So I just don't don't oversteer.
02:19:59.38 --> 02:20:00.38 Don't oversteer.
02:20:00.38 --> 02:20:01.38 No breaks.
02:20:01.38 --> 02:20:02.38 No breaks.
02:20:02.38 --> 02:20:04.38 All right, you're good.
02:20:04.38 --> 02:20:07.82 So that was not my reaction when I got down the phone by the lizard.
02:20:07.82 --> 02:20:08.82 Ah.
02:20:08.82 --> 02:20:10.82 It was hilarious.
02:20:10.82 --> 02:20:11.82 Yeah.
02:20:11.82 --> 02:20:12.82 Thank you.
02:20:12.82 --> 02:20:14.82 It's all good.
02:20:14.82 --> 02:20:22.50 But hey, man, you know, if you want to support this podcast, I will just talk about that.
02:20:22.50 --> 02:20:23.50 Impossible.
02:20:23.50 --> 02:20:24.50 Do it.
02:20:24.50 --> 02:20:27.90 So one good way and support this is the, well, okay, this is what it is.
02:20:27.90 --> 02:20:30.90 Origin right, origin the brand.
02:20:30.90 --> 02:20:31.90 Origin main.com.
02:20:31.90 --> 02:20:32.90 That's what I've said.
02:20:32.90 --> 02:20:34.70 A lot of cool stuff.
02:20:34.70 --> 02:20:39.46 One of the cool items actually there's a bunch of our keys for GJ2.
02:20:39.46 --> 02:20:44.18 I remember back when, um, kind of won't be for a started this thing.
02:20:44.18 --> 02:20:46.38 That would be the main question about GJ2.
02:20:46.38 --> 02:20:47.38 Oh, yeah.
02:20:47.38 --> 02:20:51.10 And I mean, I've been like, oh, yeah, there's these and I give them the three.
02:20:51.10 --> 02:20:53.74 The top actually there was four of them.
02:20:53.74 --> 02:20:59.14 And it was shortly after where you recommended these origin ones.
02:20:59.14 --> 02:21:02.10 And then when I went there, I was like, oh, shoot, this is kind of expensive.
02:21:02.10 --> 02:21:06.38 I don't know, you know, but then I just looked at the one that was like, it was like the
02:21:06.38 --> 02:21:07.70 first one I saw.
02:21:07.70 --> 02:21:14.34 But there are many varying prices of keys.
02:21:14.34 --> 02:21:15.94 And they're all good, by the way.
02:21:15.94 --> 02:21:18.34 I know this because I have some.
02:21:18.34 --> 02:21:26.90 Nonetheless, if you're still wondering what kind of key to get origin G, 100% you have, um,
02:21:26.90 --> 02:21:29.22 options, you know, as far as pricing and stuff like that.
02:21:29.22 --> 02:21:32.90 If you want to T-Lock's one versus the more basic one, but they're all dope.
02:21:32.90 --> 02:21:35.50 And here's the thing about them.
02:21:35.50 --> 02:21:40.34 They're all made in America and not in the sense where they're just kind of assembled
02:21:40.34 --> 02:21:46.26 in America, but the, you know, the materials of source somewhere else, the materials are
02:21:46.26 --> 02:21:47.26 sourced.
02:21:47.26 --> 02:21:48.26 Would you call them sourced?
02:21:48.26 --> 02:21:53.82 Because the raw material comes from the sea, or the sea, or the sea, or the sea, or the sea,
02:21:53.82 --> 02:21:54.82 or the sea, or the sea, or the sea.
02:21:54.82 --> 02:21:55.82 So I'm wearing it.
02:21:55.82 --> 02:21:56.82 Here America.
02:21:56.82 --> 02:21:57.82 I know that.
02:21:57.82 --> 02:21:58.82 America.
02:21:58.82 --> 02:22:04.30 It's brought over to Maine, assembled, or wouldn't not loom.
02:22:04.30 --> 02:22:05.90 Yeah, that's not appropriate.
02:22:05.90 --> 02:22:12.50 Yeah, woven on a loom, boom into this outstanding material, moisture.
02:22:12.50 --> 02:22:13.50 What do you call it?
02:22:13.50 --> 02:22:14.50 Weakling, weakling.
02:22:14.50 --> 02:22:18.42 That's when it kind of like helps with moisture.
02:22:18.42 --> 02:22:19.66 I didn't know all this by the way.
02:22:19.66 --> 02:22:21.66 I'm like being educated on it.
02:22:21.66 --> 02:22:23.74 And there's lots to know, by the way.
02:22:23.74 --> 02:22:28.78 And I, and time microbial, that's a big deal.
02:22:28.78 --> 02:22:30.58 Anyway, or do you mean dot com?
02:22:30.58 --> 02:22:31.74 That's where you get school stuff.
02:22:31.74 --> 02:22:33.34 There's other stuff too, like rashguards.
02:22:33.34 --> 02:22:36.78 And even like clothes, regular clothes, athletic wear.
02:22:36.78 --> 02:22:37.78 It's dope.
02:22:37.78 --> 02:22:40.42 Anyway, all made America in America, boom.
02:22:40.42 --> 02:22:45.70 Also, for some legitimate fitness care on it.
02:22:45.70 --> 02:22:47.06 Dot com slash jockel.
02:22:47.06 --> 02:22:49.70 I just got the, I know, I'm into kettlebells.
02:22:49.70 --> 02:22:50.66 I know I said that before.
02:22:50.66 --> 02:22:52.26 I'm going to say it again.
02:22:52.26 --> 02:22:53.10 What is yours?
02:22:53.10 --> 02:22:54.38 What is your heaviest kettlebell?
02:22:54.38 --> 02:22:56.26 I don't even have 40 kilograms.
02:22:56.26 --> 02:22:57.26 Right.
02:22:57.26 --> 02:22:58.26 So 88 pounds.
02:22:58.26 --> 02:22:59.26 Okay.
02:22:59.26 --> 02:23:00.26 Mine's 90.
02:23:00.26 --> 02:23:01.26 By the way.
02:23:01.26 --> 02:23:03.26 I have two of them.
02:23:03.26 --> 02:23:04.26 Do you only have one?
02:23:04.26 --> 02:23:05.26 I only have one.
02:23:05.26 --> 02:23:06.26 I only have one currently.
02:23:06.26 --> 02:23:07.26 I have, all right.
02:23:07.26 --> 02:23:10.26 Well, she would, I guess, you know, it's clear what I got to do.
02:23:10.26 --> 02:23:11.26 Maybe I'll get another one.
02:23:11.26 --> 02:23:12.26 Step it up.
02:23:12.26 --> 02:23:15.26 But, um, she was, I talking to you about it.
02:23:15.26 --> 02:23:16.26 Oh, yeah, more again.
02:23:16.26 --> 02:23:17.26 You know, more again.
02:23:17.26 --> 02:23:18.26 Yeah.
02:23:18.26 --> 02:23:19.26 Right.
02:23:19.26 --> 02:23:20.26 We're talking about kettlebell.
02:23:20.26 --> 02:23:21.26 Or against the Morgan's feeling strong.
02:23:21.26 --> 02:23:22.26 I told him that yesterday.
02:23:22.26 --> 02:23:23.26 Yeah.
02:23:23.26 --> 02:23:24.26 Not just because that's.
02:23:24.26 --> 02:23:27.26 It's kind of an insult in G.J.2.
02:23:27.26 --> 02:23:28.26 Yeah.
02:23:28.26 --> 02:23:29.26 Right.
02:23:29.26 --> 02:23:30.26 It's like, hey, you feel really strong.
02:23:30.26 --> 02:23:31.26 It's an insult.
02:23:31.26 --> 02:23:32.26 Yeah.
02:23:32.26 --> 02:23:34.26 But I, I made it perfectly clear yesterday.
02:23:34.26 --> 02:23:37.26 I was like, hey, you feel jujitsu strong.
02:23:37.26 --> 02:23:40.26 I said, it's not, I'm not trying to say you feel strong.
02:23:40.26 --> 02:23:42.26 Like, hey, you're a meathead.
02:23:42.26 --> 02:23:43.26 Right.
02:23:43.26 --> 02:23:45.26 But you feel strong in a positive way.
02:23:45.26 --> 02:23:47.26 Because, and I said, here's the deal.
02:23:47.26 --> 02:23:51.26 If it was just you being strong, then five years ago, when I started training
02:23:51.26 --> 02:23:52.26 here, I'm like, oh, you feel strong.
02:23:52.26 --> 02:23:54.26 I didn't say it then because didn't feel strong.
02:23:54.26 --> 02:23:56.26 You feel strong now that you're jujitsu is getting.
02:23:56.26 --> 02:23:57.26 Yeah.
02:23:57.26 --> 02:23:59.26 Get it better and you're getting more skills.
02:23:59.26 --> 02:24:00.26 Yeah.
02:24:00.26 --> 02:24:05.26 I feel like we got to come up with a different expression or maybe just a modified expression.
02:24:05.26 --> 02:24:10.26 Because some people, yeah, like, they'll, people tell me I'm strong or whatever.
02:24:10.26 --> 02:24:14.26 And after a while, I was like, wait, I felt the same thing that you, you know, one time
02:24:14.26 --> 02:24:16.26 I told you, like, you're strong.
02:24:16.26 --> 02:24:18.26 I thought it was kind of maybe subconsciously.
02:24:18.26 --> 02:24:23.26 I thought it was kind of established that, okay, look, you're really good at jujitsu.
02:24:23.26 --> 02:24:24.26 Yeah.
02:24:24.26 --> 02:24:28.26 I was kind of a given. So if I were to tell you, you're strong, it'd be kind of like,
02:24:28.26 --> 02:24:29.26 I like rebut, yeah.
02:24:29.26 --> 02:24:30.26 Was I like, oh yeah.
02:24:30.26 --> 02:24:32.26 I was like, we're like, no, my technique.
02:24:32.26 --> 02:24:33.26 You're like, no, my technique.
02:24:33.26 --> 02:24:34.26 I was like, yeah, no, no, I know that.
02:24:34.26 --> 02:24:36.26 I know your technique is outstanding.
02:24:36.26 --> 02:24:37.26 I got to sense it.
02:24:37.26 --> 02:24:39.26 Yeah, a little bit, not in an angry way or nothing like that.
02:24:39.26 --> 02:24:41.26 But yeah, yeah, I'm falling in actually.
02:24:41.26 --> 02:24:45.26 I'm surprised that I wasn't a little bit more sarcastic about it.
02:24:45.26 --> 02:24:47.26 See, okay, which means, I got surprised.
02:24:47.26 --> 02:24:50.26 I didn't say, yeah, I'm glad I'm so strong.
02:24:50.26 --> 02:24:51.26 Yeah.
02:24:51.26 --> 02:24:53.26 That I can just, you know what I straight away you like that.
02:24:53.26 --> 02:24:54.26 I know people don't mean it.
02:24:54.26 --> 02:24:55.26 I know they don't mean that.
02:24:55.26 --> 02:24:58.26 You know what, how we take it, kind of like, you're strong.
02:24:58.26 --> 02:24:59.26 Yeah.
02:24:59.26 --> 02:25:01.26 It's your physical strength, not your jujitsu technique.
02:25:01.26 --> 02:25:03.26 That's what we take it as.
02:25:03.26 --> 02:25:03.26 Yeah.
02:25:03.26 --> 02:25:07.26 And they're just throwing it in like, how, essentially, how I did with you is kind of like,
02:25:07.26 --> 02:25:09.26 look, you're better than jujitsu than me.
02:25:09.26 --> 02:25:10.26 You beat me up all the time.
02:25:10.26 --> 02:25:11.26 But in the disadvantage.
02:25:11.26 --> 02:25:13.26 You're pretty strong too.
02:25:13.26 --> 02:25:17.26 Yeah, that's probably what people are saying most of the time.
02:25:17.26 --> 02:25:20.26 But so when people be like, dang, you're strong.
02:25:20.26 --> 02:25:21.26 You're great.
02:25:21.26 --> 02:25:24.26 You, when they say you're strong, I say, yeah, I lift a lot of weight.
02:25:24.26 --> 02:25:29.26 So it kind of gives them the impression kind of like, yeah, I might weight lifting basically beats your jujitsu kind of thing.
02:25:29.26 --> 02:25:31.26 And that's a more of an insult, you know, kind of thing.
02:25:31.26 --> 02:25:32.26 Oh, brother.
02:25:32.26 --> 02:25:34.26 It's, it's a joke, really.
02:25:34.26 --> 02:25:35.26 No.
02:25:35.26 --> 02:25:36.26 Nonetheless.
02:25:36.26 --> 02:25:39.26 So, yes, Morgan, he's strong.
02:25:39.26 --> 02:25:40.26 Jujitsu strong.
02:25:40.26 --> 02:25:41.26 Jujitsu strong.
02:25:41.26 --> 02:25:42.26 So he's technique is strong.
02:25:42.26 --> 02:25:45.26 So that means his technique is getting better and it reveals.
02:25:45.26 --> 02:25:46.26 Right.
02:25:46.26 --> 02:25:48.26 It can deliver the strength in the proper way.
02:25:48.26 --> 02:25:49.26 Yeah.
02:25:49.26 --> 02:25:49.26 Yeah.
02:25:49.26 --> 02:25:50.26 That's good job.
02:25:50.26 --> 02:25:50.26 Morgan.
02:25:50.26 --> 02:25:51.26 But we were talking about kettlebells.
02:25:51.26 --> 02:25:52.26 Yeah.
02:25:52.26 --> 02:25:53.26 And he was like, bro, kettlebells are hard.
02:25:53.26 --> 02:25:55.26 So I started to feel kind of good.
02:25:55.26 --> 02:25:59.26 Because I got this 90 pound one and I was like, I lifted it up and you know, okay, you know,
02:25:59.26 --> 02:26:02.26 this, the one hand boom, clean, what do you clean press?
02:26:02.26 --> 02:26:05.26 Is there if you use your legs?
02:26:05.26 --> 02:26:07.26 If you use your legs to snap it up there a little bit.
02:26:07.26 --> 02:26:08.26 Yes, that's the cleaner jerk.
02:26:08.26 --> 02:26:09.26 Okay.
02:26:09.26 --> 02:26:10.26 You didn't want to ask.
02:26:10.26 --> 02:26:14.26 If you just do, if you don't use any legs and you just power it up smoothly, that's a press.
02:26:14.26 --> 02:26:15.26 Okay.
02:26:15.26 --> 02:26:16.26 So my, it's clean and jerk.
02:26:16.26 --> 02:26:16.26 Yeah.
02:26:16.26 --> 02:26:19.26 I just use the whole kind of body, whatever.
02:26:19.26 --> 02:26:25.26 So my met cons they do when I got the wearable funds, those are like 62 pounds.
02:26:25.26 --> 02:26:26.26 I do two at a time.
02:26:26.26 --> 02:26:27.26 Boom.
02:26:27.26 --> 02:26:28.26 Okay.
02:26:28.26 --> 02:26:29.26 Easy.
02:26:29.26 --> 02:26:31.26 And you do reps, you know, it's a whole thing.
02:26:31.26 --> 02:26:34.26 So I got this, the gorilla one, 72 pounds.
02:26:34.26 --> 02:26:36.26 And I could do that one.
02:26:36.26 --> 02:26:37.26 Just as you get strong, you know.
02:26:37.26 --> 02:26:40.26 So I get the 90 pound one and I'm like, I only got one too.
02:26:40.26 --> 02:26:41.26 So I don't know.
02:26:41.26 --> 02:26:42.26 Do you think two at one time is easier?
02:26:42.26 --> 02:26:43.26 Because of the balance, right?
02:26:43.26 --> 02:26:44.26 No, it's not easier.
02:26:44.26 --> 02:26:47.26 Just, I mean, you're using more energy for sure.
02:26:47.26 --> 02:26:50.26 But as far as like doing the balance, it's like not easier.
02:26:50.26 --> 02:26:51.26 Yeah. Okay.
02:26:51.26 --> 02:26:53.26 Well, so one is easier.
02:26:53.26 --> 02:26:54.26 One is for sure.
02:26:54.26 --> 02:26:55.26 Okay.
02:26:55.26 --> 02:26:56.26 Well, okay.
02:26:56.26 --> 02:26:57.26 Gotcha.
02:26:57.26 --> 02:26:59.26 So I got one big foot that's 90 pounds.
02:26:59.26 --> 02:27:00.26 And I lifted that up.
02:27:00.26 --> 02:27:02.26 I was like, man, I'm not.
02:27:02.26 --> 02:27:03.26 Okay.
02:27:03.26 --> 02:27:04.26 Okay.
02:27:04.26 --> 02:27:12.26 And so it was like maybe two, three days later, I was like, well, I got to try that's the, you know, like, the 72 pound one. I can do that.
02:27:12.26 --> 02:27:14.26 You know, a bunch of times actually.
02:27:14.26 --> 02:27:20.26 But so I just warmed up a bunch and just, first time I did it, like, I straight up failed. I couldn't do it.
02:27:20.26 --> 02:27:23.26 And I was like, all right, all right, I know how it feels now and all this stuff.
02:27:23.26 --> 02:27:24.26 And then I could do it.
02:27:24.26 --> 02:27:25.26 Boom, both sides.
02:27:25.26 --> 02:27:26.26 So you're good.
02:27:26.26 --> 02:27:26.26 It's boom.
02:27:26.26 --> 02:27:27.26 Yeah.
02:27:27.26 --> 02:27:27.26 That's good.
02:27:27.26 --> 02:27:28.26 So I'll let.
02:27:28.26 --> 02:27:30.26 Glad we all know that now.
02:27:30.26 --> 02:27:30.26 Yep.
02:27:30.26 --> 02:27:32.26 Hey, hey, got, you know, it's relevant.
02:27:32.26 --> 02:27:40.26 Just say actually, which is actually what makes kettlebells kind of fun to do is because it does require legitimate technique.
02:27:40.26 --> 02:27:41.26 Yeah.
02:27:41.26 --> 02:27:50.26 You can't say it like it's hard. It's like a dumbbell or a barbell or a machine. Well, if you're doing barbell snatches, it takes a hell of a ton of time.
02:27:50.26 --> 02:27:52.26 And that's really the spectrum.
02:27:52.26 --> 02:27:56.26 You know, so if you go like kettlebell and dumb, because dumbbells are straight up balanced.
02:27:56.26 --> 02:28:01.26 I mean, they're not, but they're not like a pretty, but they have a handle both sides of the handle equal amount of weight.
02:28:01.26 --> 02:28:06.26 You know, boom, you just have to balance your body and then after you get that balance down is pretty easy.
02:28:06.26 --> 02:28:12.26 Or a bell even less because you don't have two sides got to be balanced. It's just one long thing. Then two sides of that is balanced.
02:28:12.26 --> 02:28:18.26 Then you go machine, you don't even need balance. You just need this strength to push. So it's that spectrum to the kettlebell.
02:28:18.26 --> 02:28:24.26 It's a way on this side of the spectrum where it kind of, there's the game within the game, you know, this will make some more fun.
02:28:24.26 --> 02:28:29.26 I think you see progress in both areas technique and strength.
02:28:29.26 --> 02:28:31.26 Anyway, we'll leave it at that.
02:28:31.26 --> 02:28:39.26 If you want the cool kettlebells on it dot com slash chuckle or jump ropes battle maces.
02:28:39.26 --> 02:28:42.26 The way, do you call them battle maces or just maces?
02:28:42.26 --> 02:28:44.26 Yeah, those are going to clubs.
02:28:44.26 --> 02:28:50.26 Yeah, though, you can get some cool workouts with that and they do like your forearms get.
02:28:50.26 --> 02:29:00.26 I didn't look into like what exactly, you know, they're going to improve, but I know course strength and all this stuff, but there's all these little things they improve too.
02:29:00.26 --> 02:29:02.26 How's Danny's stuff?
02:29:02.26 --> 02:29:10.26 Also, good way to support if you're going to get this book men at how do you pronounce good the place?
02:29:10.26 --> 02:29:15.26 Or name, or name, or name, or name, or name, or name, Jeffrey Powell.
02:29:15.26 --> 02:29:16.26 That's how I pronounce it anyway.
02:29:16.26 --> 02:29:19.26 Some of apologize to anyone that's from Holland.
02:29:19.26 --> 02:29:20.26 Yeah.
02:29:20.26 --> 02:29:21.26 And pronounce it a different way.
02:29:21.26 --> 02:29:23.26 I looked at it on YouTube and how they said it.
02:29:23.26 --> 02:29:26.26 And it was like, they say, oh, how do pronounce our name?
02:29:26.26 --> 02:29:33.26 And there's 14 different ways to say it. So I just rolled the dice and picked one that sounded easiest for me to say.
02:29:33.26 --> 02:29:36.26 So sorry if I'm saying it wrong.
02:29:36.26 --> 02:29:38.26 Yeah, man, no, all good.

02:30:24.26 --> 02:30:26.26 That's a long story. I think I went into it.
02:30:26.26 --> 02:30:30.26 It was like when I was like testing like what website provider whatever.
02:30:30.26 --> 02:30:34.26 I was like let me get this one because what if I'm attached it and it's a long story.
02:30:34.26 --> 02:30:39.26 And then, so we ended up getting jokopodcast.com and they're both kind of there.
02:30:39.26 --> 02:30:43.26 But jokopodcast2 is kind of the primary one.
02:30:43.26 --> 02:30:46.26 It's not the primary one anymore.
02:30:46.26 --> 02:30:47.26 Jokopodcast.
02:30:47.26 --> 02:30:49.26 It's jokopodcast.com.

02:30:50.26 --> 02:30:51.26 So that's the website.
02:30:51.26 --> 02:30:54.26 And that was actually a trooper that straight up got us jokopodcast.

02:30:59.26 --> 02:30:59.26 Yeah.
02:30:59.26 --> 02:31:04.26 That's a huge deal because like, do you have your own name?
02:31:04.26 --> 02:31:05.26 Yeah.
02:31:05.26 --> 02:31:05.26 Okay.
02:31:05.26 --> 02:31:08.26 So people will be like, oh, this guy's blowing up.
02:31:08.26 --> 02:31:10.26 They'll go and they'll buy the domain name either.
02:31:10.26 --> 02:31:14.26 Hold onto it or immediately go to you and be like, hey, you want to buy this for me?
02:31:14.26 --> 02:31:15.26 Yeah.
02:31:15.26 --> 02:31:16.26 They told it a hostage.
02:31:16.26 --> 02:31:16.26 Yeah.
02:31:16.26 --> 02:31:20.26 In fact, I think there might be like a legal like defense against it.
02:31:20.26 --> 02:31:25.26 Like if someone gets your name or your your kids name and you're kind of a public for your
02:31:25.26 --> 02:31:27.26 I think I'm not sure.
02:31:27.26 --> 02:31:28.26 But yeah, that's what people do meant.
02:31:28.26 --> 02:31:31.26 They'll or they'll buy a bunch of domain names that sound cool.

02:31:34.26 --> 02:31:35.26 You can buy this for me.
02:31:35.26 --> 02:31:36.26 Kind of thing.
02:31:36.26 --> 02:31:38.26 It's super whack when they do it with like Euro.
02:31:38.26 --> 02:31:40.26 You know, when they know like that's your company.
02:31:40.26 --> 02:31:42.26 You have to be had for a long time.
02:31:42.26 --> 02:31:44.26 They, I don't know what they've paid for.
02:31:44.26 --> 02:31:46.26 Eventually paid for UFC dot com.
02:31:46.26 --> 02:31:49.26 But for a long time, they were like UFC dot TV and all these.
02:31:49.26 --> 02:31:50.26 Yeah.
02:31:50.26 --> 02:31:51.26 They had to step up.
02:31:51.26 --> 02:31:54.26 I bet you they bet somebody made a lot of money off that one.
02:31:54.26 --> 02:31:55.26 Yeah.
02:31:55.26 --> 02:31:57.26 You see, especially the three letters.
02:31:57.26 --> 02:31:58.26 Yes.
02:31:58.26 --> 02:31:59.26 Like if you get the last letter.
02:31:59.26 --> 02:32:00.26 That's a lot of money.
02:32:00.26 --> 02:32:01.26 Crazy Tom.
02:32:01.26 --> 02:32:03.26 Nonetheless, but yeah, jacobadcast dot com.
02:32:03.26 --> 02:32:04.26 That's the main website.
02:32:04.26 --> 02:32:05.26 No.
02:32:05.26 --> 02:32:09.26 If you were going to jacobadcast too dot com, it's it's not that anymore.
02:32:09.26 --> 02:32:10.26 Does that send you the over?
02:32:10.26 --> 02:32:12.26 It does did.
02:32:12.26 --> 02:32:14.26 But while I'm switching, I'm doing this thing.
02:32:14.26 --> 02:32:15.26 It will eventually.
02:32:15.26 --> 02:32:16.26 It will eventually.
02:32:16.26 --> 02:32:21.26 But if you run into that, that's why people have been hitting me up.
02:32:21.26 --> 02:32:23.26 And rightly so.
02:32:23.26 --> 02:32:24.26 Thanks for that.
02:32:24.26 --> 02:32:28.26 So yeah, nonetheless, back to the point, if you want to support and by getting these books

02:32:45.26 --> 02:32:47.26 Google play.
02:32:47.26 --> 02:32:50.26 Any anywhere they will where they provide podcasts.
02:32:50.26 --> 02:32:51.26 Boom, we're on there.
02:32:51.26 --> 02:32:52.26 So subscribe.
02:32:52.26 --> 02:32:53.26 That's a good way.
02:32:53.26 --> 02:32:54.26 Also YouTube.
02:32:54.26 --> 02:32:56.26 Yes, I put some excerpts on there.
02:32:56.26 --> 02:32:57.26 More excerpts.
02:32:57.26 --> 02:32:59.26 I'm going to continue to do so.
02:32:59.26 --> 02:33:00.26 Shareable excerpts.
02:33:00.26 --> 02:33:02.26 Try to keep them under four minutes.
02:33:02.26 --> 02:33:03.26 That's cool right?
02:33:03.26 --> 02:33:04.26 Yeah.
02:33:04.26 --> 02:33:05.26 Might be a little long.
02:33:05.26 --> 02:33:06.26 But everyone's in a while.
02:33:06.26 --> 02:33:08.26 You get it like a good like 10 minute one.
02:33:08.26 --> 02:33:09.26 Pressure thing.
02:33:09.26 --> 02:33:10.26 Yeah.
02:33:10.26 --> 02:33:11.26 But they're more sure better than two.
02:33:11.26 --> 02:33:12.26 That's a long thing.
02:33:12.26 --> 02:33:17.26 Think about the videos that you want to get compression three minutes four minutes tops.
02:33:17.26 --> 02:33:18.26 Yeah.
02:33:18.26 --> 02:33:20.26 And it depends on the, you should edit them maybe.
02:33:20.26 --> 02:33:22.26 Like make them shorter.
02:33:22.26 --> 02:33:23.26 Yeah.
02:33:23.26 --> 02:33:24.26 Yeah.
02:33:24.26 --> 02:33:28.26 I mean, if it's appropriate because sometimes you don't want it.
02:33:28.26 --> 02:33:31.26 Sometimes it's just you saying like a whole thing.
02:33:31.26 --> 02:33:33.26 And it's like, okay, that's solid.
02:33:33.26 --> 02:33:34.26 And sometimes it's you.
02:33:34.26 --> 02:33:39.26 And then my rebuttal to kind of kind of bolster the point your point because you'll
02:33:39.26 --> 02:33:41.26 clarify it because I, you know.
02:33:41.26 --> 02:33:43.26 And it's all it's, it makes sense.
02:33:43.26 --> 02:33:47.26 So sometimes if you edit certain things out, maybe the message isn't there.
02:33:47.26 --> 02:33:48.26 Sure.
02:33:48.26 --> 02:33:49.26 Much as much as you should be.
02:33:49.26 --> 02:33:50.26 Not all the time.
02:33:50.26 --> 02:33:51.26 Not all the time.
02:33:51.26 --> 02:33:52.26 But most of the time.
02:33:52.26 --> 02:33:54.26 Nonetheless, I'll look into it about that.
02:33:54.26 --> 02:34:02.26 Ideally, if a video and this goes along with like people's typical attention span,
02:34:02.26 --> 02:34:04.26 it should be what?
02:34:04.26 --> 02:34:06.26 Like about a minute and a half.
02:34:06.26 --> 02:34:07.26 I don't know about my attention span.
02:34:07.26 --> 02:34:09.26 It's getting tested right now.
02:34:09.26 --> 02:34:11.26 But I support you.
02:34:11.26 --> 02:34:15.26 Just saying, this is important stuff we need to go over this.
02:34:15.26 --> 02:34:21.26 So we can come to the best conclusion on how to conduct ourselves in regards to YouTube
02:34:21.26 --> 02:34:23.26 excerpts and other things.
02:34:23.26 --> 02:34:25.26 Nonetheless, subscribe to YouTube channel.
02:34:25.26 --> 02:34:26.26 It's good.
02:34:26.26 --> 02:34:28.26 We're going to provide value.
02:34:28.26 --> 02:34:29.26 How about that?
02:34:29.26 --> 02:34:30.26 No.

02:35:16.26 --> 02:35:20.26 I think I'm going to do a warrior kid rashguard.
02:35:20.26 --> 02:35:21.26 I have one.
02:35:21.26 --> 02:35:22.26 Yeah.

02:35:25.26 --> 02:35:26.26 Yeah.
02:35:26.26 --> 02:35:27.26 And it's not.
02:35:27.26 --> 02:35:28.26 I'm going to change it a little bit.
02:35:28.26 --> 02:35:30.26 Some coloring stuff and whatever.
02:35:30.26 --> 02:35:31.26 But it is pretty cool.

02:35:40.26 --> 02:35:42.26 Check it out.
02:35:42.26 --> 02:35:47.26 If you want to support and you want to get something, you think something is cool.
02:35:47.26 --> 02:35:53.26 For yourself or for your, you know, friend, girlfriend, neighbor, whoever.
02:35:53.26 --> 02:35:54.26 Then get something.
02:35:54.26 --> 02:35:55.26 Good way to support.
02:35:55.26 --> 02:35:57.26 Actually, great way to support.
02:35:57.26 --> 02:35:59.26 Also psychological warfare.
02:35:59.26 --> 02:36:00.26 Okay.
02:36:00.26 --> 02:36:05.26 What psychological warfare is if you don't know, it's an album with jockel tracks.
02:36:05.26 --> 02:36:13.26 So basically, if you're on your campaign against weakness and you have a moment of weakness,
02:36:13.26 --> 02:36:14.26 this is like a little spot.
02:36:14.26 --> 02:36:22.26 So basically, you put on these audio tracks to let you know, hey, pragmatically, don't skip this
02:36:22.26 --> 02:36:23.26 work out today.
02:36:23.26 --> 02:36:25.26 Hey, don't slip on this diet today.
02:36:25.26 --> 02:36:28.26 Hey, your procrastination isn't working.
02:36:28.26 --> 02:36:29.26 And here's why.
02:36:29.26 --> 02:36:30.26 But it's jockel telling you.
02:36:30.26 --> 02:36:34.26 So it's kind of like more effective way more effective.
02:36:34.26 --> 02:36:38.26 100% success rate in my experience.
02:36:38.26 --> 02:36:39.26 100%
02:36:39.26 --> 02:36:40.26 Best legit.
02:36:40.26 --> 02:36:43.26 Hey, also jockel,
02:36:43.26 --> 02:36:44.26 why, if you want it, you can get that on Amazon.
02:36:44.26 --> 02:36:47.26 It tastes good and it makes you feel good.
02:36:47.26 --> 02:36:53.26 Also, on originmain.com, you can get jocco, super curl.
02:36:53.26 --> 02:36:56.26 Criollo, that will make you feel good.
02:36:56.26 --> 02:37:02.26 And on top of that, you can get jocco joint warfare, which is awesome.
02:37:02.26 --> 02:37:04.26 What's in that, by the way?
02:37:04.26 --> 02:37:07.26 It's glucosamine,
02:37:07.26 --> 02:37:12.26 control goes the main, the main, but then we put some additional things in there.
02:37:12.26 --> 02:37:14.26 Yeah, and it's it's been rocking.
02:37:14.26 --> 02:37:17.26 It's it's it's awesome.
02:37:17.26 --> 02:37:20.26 You've got books or I've got some books.
02:37:20.26 --> 02:37:23.26 If you want to read them, one is called Way the Warrior Kid.
02:37:23.26 --> 02:37:25.26 One is called Extreme Ownership.
02:37:25.26 --> 02:37:27.26 The Warrior Kid book is for kids.
02:37:27.26 --> 02:37:31.26 Extreme ownership is for people and leadership positions or people that want to be in leadership positions.
02:37:31.26 --> 02:37:35.26 There's also a new book coming out called Discipline equals Freedom Field Manual.
02:37:35.26 --> 02:37:37.26 It actually comes out October 17th.
02:37:37.26 --> 02:37:42.26 And at one point, many months ago, October 17th seemed like it was a long way as a way,
02:37:42.26 --> 02:37:44.26 but it's not anymore.
02:37:44.26 --> 02:37:45.26 It's here.
02:37:45.26 --> 02:37:46.26 So you can order that one.
02:37:46.26 --> 02:37:50.26 It is unlike any book that you have ever seen or read.
02:37:50.26 --> 02:37:54.26 Also, what's interesting about this book is people keep asking me if it's going to be unaudible.
02:37:54.26 --> 02:37:56.26 It's not going to be unaudible.
02:37:56.26 --> 02:37:59.26 Instead of being unaudible, it is going to be un iTunes.
02:37:59.26 --> 02:38:02.26 It's going to be on Amazon MP3.
02:38:02.26 --> 02:38:05.26 It's going to be on Google Play.
02:38:05.26 --> 02:38:09.26 It's going to be where you can find MP3 tracks.
02:38:09.26 --> 02:38:10.26 There's a reason for this.
02:38:10.26 --> 02:38:15.26 If you do it through audible, you get this one big, long book.
02:38:15.26 --> 02:38:20.26 And what the book is, the way the book is written, it's written to be chunked up.
02:38:20.26 --> 02:38:24.26 And you're going to want to take parts of it and play it at certain times.
02:38:24.26 --> 02:38:27.26 More like you would do with the psychological warfare album.
02:38:27.26 --> 02:38:30.26 So people are asking for more psychological warfare.
02:38:30.26 --> 02:38:31.26 That's what we're doing.
02:38:31.26 --> 02:38:32.26 Discipline and go to freedom field manual.
02:38:32.26 --> 02:38:35.26 It's going to be available as an album that you can buy.
02:38:35.26 --> 02:38:37.26 And then you can do what you want with the track.
02:38:37.26 --> 02:38:39.26 You can make them your alarm ringtone.
02:38:39.26 --> 02:38:41.26 You can listen to them out of order in any order.
02:38:41.26 --> 02:38:43.26 You can put them in a mix.
02:38:43.26 --> 02:38:44.26 You can do a lot more stuff with them.
02:38:44.26 --> 02:38:51.26 That's why we're doing it as an album with tracks instead of as an audible book.
02:38:51.26 --> 02:38:52.26 So you know what?
02:38:52.26 --> 02:38:56.26 We might, you know, people might have a little challenge finding it or realizing,
02:38:56.26 --> 02:38:59.26 you know, when they go on an Amazon or they go on a Barnes and Noble,
02:38:59.26 --> 02:39:01.26 they won't see that it's available.
02:39:01.26 --> 02:39:04.26 They'll be looking for the audible and you won't be able to find it.
02:39:04.26 --> 02:39:05.26 I'm sorry.
02:39:05.26 --> 02:39:08.26 We'll just in the audible, I think that's where they won't find it.
02:39:08.26 --> 02:39:10.26 You don't be able to find it in the audible platform.
02:39:10.26 --> 02:39:11.26 Right.
02:39:11.26 --> 02:39:12.26 We're not being there.
02:39:12.26 --> 02:39:13.26 But it'll be on Amazon just a little bit on Amazon.
02:39:13.26 --> 02:39:18.26 But you, I don't think it'll be linked in to the same thing where you go,
02:39:18.26 --> 02:39:19.26 oh, here it is.
02:39:19.26 --> 02:39:20.26 I think it's going to be hidden.
02:39:20.26 --> 02:39:21.26 It's going to be hard to find.
02:39:21.26 --> 02:39:22.26 Kind of like a tart to find on iTunes.
02:39:22.26 --> 02:39:24.26 It's hard to find psychological warfare.
02:39:24.26 --> 02:39:29.26 But the question is, do you want to do, did I want to do something right or just do something easy?
02:39:29.26 --> 02:39:30.26 Yeah, that's true.
02:39:30.26 --> 02:39:35.26 Because the, the field manual, like any field manual, like when you want to go refer to it,
02:39:35.26 --> 02:39:37.26 you don't want to be searching around.
02:39:37.26 --> 02:39:38.26 Yeah, it's really not.
02:39:38.26 --> 02:39:39.26 Yeah, it's really not.
02:39:39.26 --> 02:39:42.26 You mean like, okay, what is that one part, you know, that deals with this and you,
02:39:42.26 --> 02:39:45.26 boom, you can just go to the, you just look for a track name in there.
02:39:45.26 --> 02:39:49.26 So like I said, we could have done the easy thing and, and whatever,
02:39:49.26 --> 02:39:51.26 you know, had everyone just be able to click on it really easy.
02:39:51.26 --> 02:39:55.26 I'm, I apologize, but if you want the right way, then that's what I had to do.
02:39:55.26 --> 02:39:57.26 So that's that book.
02:39:57.26 --> 02:40:04.26 And then echelon front, that's the leadership consulting company that I have with
02:40:04.26 --> 02:40:07.26 Lave Babin, with JB to know, Dave Burke.
