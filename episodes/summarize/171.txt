and I always always told him like when he told me that I was like I felt like my legs were like a lizard's tail you know it's like they're grow back like you see it on the news all the time what you've never expected to happen to yourself and here I am I didn't care nothing about the vision I just wanted my legs back because it was it was tough those first two or three weeks after I get out of ICU like I wouldn't eat nothing I was so skinny I could barely lift my head up off the bed and the hospital banned that they gave me would go all the way up to my my bicep pretty much because I just wouldn't want to eat I wanted to die like the nurses hated me like one of the nurses coming like two in the morning I finally got some sleep and she kept poking me around with the needle you blew your ACL that was like since I really did blow my ACL 10 to 12 to land like 15 years earlier my other site I knew that my knees were loose because the gut the doctor at that time was like hey you have really like I don't know long legaments I don't know I know that sounds funny like long legaments I know and we would I mean we would literally patrol them down the streets at K-bay Kanye O'Bay Hawaii and they had a couple old barracks that we'd work mounts you know we do mount training with and with simmerounds and you know we do we do what it bellows which was like a little air force base that they were starting to create like a mount town and that's when we did a lot of our training and kind of our field work and now at this point are you starting to think and you got guys that are just coming back from Afghanistan are you starting to think like okay now I really need to start paying attention the reason I'm asking you these questions is because I'm trying to relate you know when I joined the navy it was 1990 there was like I guess the Gulf War was kind of on the horizon and it's uh so it's like I work out as much as I possibly came because it's like I never know what you know this organization I do a lot of events with like sometimes I'll just call me up like hey you want to do a Spartan race in two weeks it's like oh sure you know I didn't want my life to you know revert back to pain pills and just you know I feel a little bit of pain then then I'm going to go like go take a pill and you know I replace that with Stan Busy staying active going to the gym working out and and it really helped out a lot I didn't just you know if I felt like I got pain then I'm gonna go give it some pain you know but you know like last year I climbed out right here or half a half a mountain here and this year I'm going to go out and sum it up hopefully in July so I just uh anything I can do to really like challenge myself and always I always tell my prosthesis and like any like I got the X3 on my left leg which is like the best of the best and I'm like my goal in life is to break this leg and you know the Marine Corps you know it's the joining the Marine Corps in 2004 was the greatest decision in my life for the reasons like this right now because it was the Marine Corps that was there each and every day in my hospital room talking to me and helping me understand that this road that I'm getting ready to go down you know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and not only talking about my deployment or talking about the Marine Corps but just talking about life and coming in there joking around with me and because you know looking back on it now like I'm truly fortunate and blessed to be here today because the amount of blood I lost was a body's worth of blood my left leg was taken from me I have a piece of my small intestines taken out you know shred no winter both my eyes but he doesn't look the way he sounds Matt's like oh good cool thanks because otherwise he you know he might have said something like you know maybe if you're trying to put on weight like maybe echo needs to all right just by sound like you maybe need to do some squats when I was in the hospital I had like a color every time I would make fun of somebody then they would be in the room and I love it you know it's just this is what I've been given and I might as well accept it and move on you know improvise something that we're always learning the Marine Corps and you know when I when I do speak in engagements I focus on a lot of things in the Marine Corps that I learned like a depth and overcome and you know the next one is lead by example which you know a lot about I'm sure and then the next one's never quit and through it all through those three attitude is everything if you walk into any situation with the positive attitude that's the first step to success if you think about something negatively then you're never going to accomplish anything so when I was laying in that hospital bed there was no negative thoughts you know oh you're gonna get your big goal you know you got your big goal in the future but what you have to do is you have to set up these little goals along the way to get you there at that point in the right direction so your big goal is you wanted to stay in the Marine Corps be able to read less than order to be able to do that you had to be able to walk you had to be able to function and so you just had to fight through these little things every single day to make progress and it's funny because you know the way I've honestly described this before is like it's like shooting when you're looking you know you got your target that's far off in the distance 400 meters away if you stare at that thing your vision's gonna get blurry and and I think and it really um it made the trip as we were flying back home we were going over Iceland and the pilot brought back this little letter and he gave me to my buddy and my buddy right at two minutes said US forces have killed us on bin Laden and I was like you know what that's the perfect closure to a closure trip because like we all joined the military after 2001 to go after him you know to kill him and and knowing that this happened on my closure trip it's like it honestly like gave me it got me emotional they just get down in the dumps and they give up and really it's like you got to learn to battle through those adversities and you know at the end of the day when you put your head down the pillow and close your eyes you wake up to a new day you know and a new day with new challenges but you got to learn to overcome those challenges because in life it's a mountain you're going to continue to climb up a mountain and it's never going to flatten out you're constantly going to go over any you know obstacles, boulders, whatever's in your way and the only way to go over is to climb it it's not to find an easy way around or turn around and quit you know and you know once we left Alessad we took we flew up to the hath ditha dam and mill the night say they're overnight we started loading our mags and we got in a big convoy and we drove into a hath ditha and it was I mean you just like you hear the stories of hath ditha from three three and then when three one went through there stint before and and it's just while while west and again you only see it on TV you never expect to be walking the same streets and you know this stuff going on but you know the first time we went out on patrol it was it was nerve wracking it was like it's like you do this in training so much you know we do some case work with veterans but truly it's just getting out of the district and being around veterans and kind of letting them know what kind of legislative bills are out there that could affect them both positive and negatively I mean there's so much out there that they need to know about and it's been truly a joy you know getting it will work with a lot of Vietnam veterans and you know these are some of the happiest guys that I've ever met my life for what they had to go through you know and you know through it's like you know through it's like each year I try to find something new to do and for some weird reason this year I was like I've got on the stationary bike because my goal is to in July I'm going to bike from Seattle to Portland it's like a 203 mile two day event and it this picture starts to get uh kind of painted in my head when I hear like these cool stories so like I don't know you know like if you're uh it's gonna be a bad analogy but bear with we all know you're good but he went up to her and gave her a birthday he invited her to his birthday and it like he come home and told me in a man to that and that truly brought tears to our eyes because it's like they get it you know when I was their age if I saw a kid that was in you know a special wedge class I didn't walk up and try to talk to him you know I felt like they were different than me and I say to away from that
