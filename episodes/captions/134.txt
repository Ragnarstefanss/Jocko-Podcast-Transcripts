[00:00:00] This is Jocopodcast number 134 with echo Charles and me, Jocca Willink. Good evening,
[00:00:08] echo. Good evening. Maybe I was always in the wrong place at the wrong time. I can see
[00:00:20] where someone could get that idea, but I actually don't think that. I don't think that at
[00:00:31] all. It's in fact quite the opposite. Now, looking back, of course, there were some,
[00:00:46] sometimes, there were some awful times. I'd even go so far as to say there were some
[00:00:57] wretched times. There were nights filled with discomfort and stress and fear and there was pressure.
[00:01:18] And sometimes that pressure was so great that I thought my mind just might fracture and
[00:01:30] break apart. But fortunately, I could tell you that I didn't break. There were times when
[00:01:44] I saw the cracks. I saw the cracks starting to split open and I had to work hard to keep
[00:01:51] it together. But that's the way it was in my old line of work. My old line of work had some
[00:02:06] definite down sides. Because on top of all that pressure and stress and fear and discomfort,
[00:02:19] there was death. Even during peace time, even during peace time, I lost friends and I lost
[00:02:32] teammates. It goes with the personality profile. They would say risk takers. So even peace
[00:02:48] provided little peace. And then once the war started, it just escalated. Not just for me,
[00:03:02] not by any stretch whatsoever. Every military member has dealt with death in some way over
[00:03:09] the past 17 years of war. Some more than others. There've also been life-changing wounds of which
[00:03:26] I was spared. I was lucky. But many others were not so lucky. Because the bombs and the
[00:03:44] bullets and the ID's and the mortars and the rockets, they do not care who you are at all.
[00:03:51] But for whatever reason, I made it through. I was lucky. And now my life goes on.
[00:04:19] Maybe on a little more paranoid than the next person. Maybe I don't always sleep that well.
[00:04:24] And maybe there's times when some fought or some memory catches me off guard. And I end up
[00:04:30] relieving a moment from the past. A moment from the past that I wish I could change. And
[00:04:43] you might think, wouldn't I just want to change it all? When I want to go back and erase
[00:04:54] all that pain and replace it with relief and replace it with ease and with comfort. And
[00:05:10] the answer to that question is no. In fact, it's not just no. It's hell no. Because wrapped up
[00:05:23] in that pain and wrapped up in that discomfort and wrapped up in that stress and anxiety,
[00:05:29] wrapped up in all that is the polar opposites of all those feelings. Inside all that turmoil
[00:05:40] there was relief. There was certainty. There was happiness. There was focus and security. And
[00:05:52] there was peace. Peace of mind in knowing that no matter what. No matter what horrors befell
[00:06:07] me things would be okay. And that is because I knew that my brothers would take care of
[00:06:17] me no matter what. You see, my old job allowed me to work with some of the best guys in the
[00:06:29] world. Not all of them. You've heard me talk about that before. There's substandard people
[00:06:38] in every organization in the world. There's a bell curve. And the bottom of the bell curve
[00:06:44] is filled with the same deficient people. You'll find anywhere. Lazy, scamming, irresponsible,
[00:06:57] self-centered, whatever. But at the high end of that bell curve. But guys, I worked with
[00:07:11] were righteous and noble and hardworking and it was humbling to be around them. Now, were
[00:07:22] they perfect? No. None of us are. Did they have flaws? Yes, absolutely. All of us fall
[00:07:31] short. But could I count on them? Could I count on them without question and without hesitation?
[00:07:45] 100%. Through all the horror and the fear and the pressure, there were always some guys
[00:07:56] that I knew without a shred of doubt would stand beside me and hold the line no matter
[00:08:02] what they would never let me down ever. And as fate would have it, I'm lucky enough to have
[00:08:24] one of those few men that I knew I could always count on no matter what here with me tonight.
[00:08:34] He's done more for me and for the teams and for our great nation than the world is ever going to
[00:08:40] know. His name is Mike Sirelli. He's a former recon Marine. A very recently retired seal officer
[00:08:52] and he's someone that's never let me down. So Mike, welcome to the podcast and thanks for coming
[00:09:04] on brother. Hey, Jocco, have you been here in that go? Thank you for having me. So you retired
[00:09:12] how long ago? Large first, large first. And so no one knows anything about you, which is the
[00:09:19] way it is. And so let's get to know a little bit about you starting with the beginning.
[00:09:27] Let's start in NorrCal. NorrCal, right? NorrCal, Palo Alto, California. Just about 30 minutes
[00:09:35] south of San Francisco. Entire family born and raised in San Francisco. They're all still back there
[00:09:41] except for my brother, White Fish Montana. But you know, nothing to really lack in terms of
[00:09:47] grown up at a great family. Sometimes I just grabbed growing up in this house. The Sirelli household
[00:09:53] is being in 1960s, 1950s, Germany, Berlin. Except I was on the wrong side of the wall.
[00:10:01] No, I had a you know, grew up in a very Catholic family, loving parents, very strict
[00:10:06] stern parents. But I got the benefit of being the last child. And by that, you know, that point,
[00:10:13] they older brother and sister. They'd worn down the, they'd worn down your parents a little bit.
[00:10:18] They'd worn down my parents a little bit. And so I got away with Bloody Murder to a point.
[00:10:24] But you know, standard upbringing of a seal. I had my share of trouble. I got a cost.
[00:10:33] And it's probably I went, why went the path that I went? I went, what point did you,
[00:10:37] at what point did you realize that you were going to go in the military?
[00:10:41] So you know, I can't, you know, pinpoint a specific moment. But everything was driving that,
[00:10:49] you know, driving me that way. I did have a grandfather. That was first of the 50 first.
[00:10:55] Oh, wow. And World War II. Actually, he trained with patent out in, oh, and, you know,
[00:11:03] yeah, the lake is training center. Yes. So they actually trained at the lake. Oh, okay.
[00:11:09] Um, near New Zealand. Okay. Oh, let's see. Salt and sea. And so he'd actually hit the very early
[00:11:16] part of Africa. And then came back to the, uh, the states, uh, when airborne and he was a quartermaster,
[00:11:23] uh, for the first of the 50 set. I'm sorry, first of the 50 first. And then the last,
[00:11:28] he still went through airborne training. He would jump in with them. And so he was actually a, uh,
[00:11:32] third day of Normandy drop day. And then, uh, fought in the, uh, the battle of the ball in the black
[00:11:40] forest. And so that humble confidence that he never spoke about. And so my mom would naturally tell
[00:11:47] me stories. And, um, it wasn't until I became a Marine that he actually, you know, really revealed
[00:11:54] a lot of the stories from, uh, from World War II. And then, you know, as he got older, it was, it was
[00:11:58] the same stories. But I would sit there and listen for the 15th time as if it was the first time I was,
[00:12:04] you know, hearing it. I got out of respect. You know, it's interesting. I was talking to Dave
[00:12:09] Burke once again today. Good deal. And yeah, good deal. We were talking about reading about face.
[00:12:15] And, uh, I was saying, hey, you know, when you were read about the, the older I got, the more
[00:12:23] it meant to me. And there's a quote that, that from Musashi that I talked about on the podcast, which is
[00:12:27] it's something like this. And I'm not going to get it perfectly right. But it's something like this.
[00:12:32] When you know the way, then you see the way and all things. So about face is not a leadership book at
[00:12:40] all. But when you read it and you are thinking about leadership, it's just all about leadership. It's
[00:12:45] 100% about leadership. But it reminds me of what you're saying. Like when you're a little, when you're a
[00:12:49] kid and you don't know the way yet and your grandfather could be telling you these stories. And it
[00:12:54] sounds kind of cool or whatever. But compared to when you actually know and understand war and
[00:13:01] you, it's just a totally different story. And as a matter of fact, speak to that. When you were
[00:13:08] running the Jocci course, I was, I came in and I was going to do like the brief that I would do to the
[00:13:12] Jocci course. And you know, you were there. It was like the 10th time you were going to watch it.
[00:13:17] And I was like, I'm going to hang out and watch this or you're just going to leave and go do like
[00:13:20] work out or something. And you're like, no, I'm going to stick around and I was like, why are you
[00:13:24] for what? And you're like, I learned something new every time. All the like dead. So that's pretty
[00:13:30] definitely when you get older, you can appreciate some of these things from when you know the way.
[00:13:36] Well, let's look at extreme ownership. I mean, this is why you hear people that are like,
[00:13:40] hey, I'm reading it for the seventh time. Yeah. Because they, they will get 10 new things or
[00:13:44] their perspective is changed. That's the, that's the part that I didn't account for. And I don't
[00:13:48] know who told me this. Somebody told me this like, it was someone that had come to multiple
[00:13:53] monsters. And I said, well, you know, how do you like this one? And all the monsters are a little bit different.
[00:13:58] But the first three were not that different. The first three were the same, almost the same.
[00:14:03] And someone said, well, it's only been a year, but my perspective is totally different.
[00:14:07] Outside, I've been promoted one time and I got different situations going on. So it's I'm seeing it
[00:14:11] differently. So that's, that's another thing that happens as you get again, older.
[00:14:15] So back to you, how did you pick the Marine Corps or did the Marine Corps pick you? So we
[00:14:25] a little bit above out of options. No, hey, so you're standard, again, high school sports,
[00:14:32] loved running, loved wrestling. The grades, not so much. It wasn't for a lack of
[00:14:39] aptitude. It was a lack of complete effort. And so, you know, loved to party. If it didn't have to
[00:14:47] do with parties or girls, I wasn't involved. And so I actually was the only one in my high school
[00:14:55] class, not to graduate. Yes. And I think going forward with my mom is a little
[00:15:03] Italian woman. And she, you know, she really is the rock of the family. And you have to know
[00:15:11] how to play her. My dad is just the disciplinary and you feared him. You just feared him.
[00:15:16] Bottom line. But your, you know, my mom was a nurture and a disciplinary and you just had to play
[00:15:21] both sides because once you put her onto the disciplinary side, you just had no safe,
[00:15:27] safe house whatsoever anywhere in the surrounding household. So they did, you know, my dad had
[00:15:33] served in Vietnam in the reserves. He did not have to go to Vietnam because he had a very unique skill.
[00:15:38] He was very good at football. And back in the day, he was stationed in Fort Boca, he was in Louisiana.
[00:15:43] He got assigned to the football team. And that's what he did in the army. But very different
[00:15:48] army wasn't a fan in the military. Just, you know, we were different in those regards, but we're
[00:15:54] very much alike. So I went off to the university, Colorado, Colorado, Boulder, the,
[00:16:00] how did you do this reading graduate high school to get your junior year? So I went,
[00:16:04] went back for the summer school, summer session and finished their requirement.
[00:16:08] I'd already been accepted into the university, Colorado Boulder. The early stage of my life
[00:16:15] is not just parents can't say there's a whole lot of pride there. From the end of high school
[00:16:20] until about the first year of college. So I did not pick up a ROTC and naval ROTC scholarship
[00:16:28] at Boulder, but you can enroll as a volunteer in hopes of picking up a scholarship. So I joined the
[00:16:36] Naval ROTC at University of Colorado Boulder and shortly got kicked out just for getting in trouble.
[00:16:43] And I remember the, the, the, the time midship and commander pulled me in for my counseling
[00:16:50] and said you will never become a Navy seal. And also at that time, you wanted to be in the seal
[00:16:56] through this. So I was going between the seals and force recon and you know, lo and behold,
[00:17:01] we had this guy then I want you to use his last name who is a force recon Marine fifth force
[00:17:06] at the university, Colorado Boulder as a Mesa Marine and Lister Commission, the education program
[00:17:11] Marine and was just impressive built like a little tank. Everything about a marticulate, smart,
[00:17:19] confident, not the loudest guy in the room. And so he sort of took me under as wings. I hate don't worry about it.
[00:17:26] College is not going to work out for you, let's go around. Why don't you do what you want to do?
[00:17:33] And you know, walking down to the other recruiting office in Boulder, Colorado, signed up,
[00:17:39] and when I signed up, I came back to Northern California for a few months while I was waiting for my
[00:17:44] bootcamp date. I enjoyed myself. And then when it was time to go, I sort of dropped the last
[00:17:52] minute information on my parents. Mom, having a father that was in the military, she accepted it
[00:17:57] pretty well. And for my father, he was not Abby. Given his, everything is about our perceptions
[00:18:05] of life and his perception, his experience with the army was not a favorable one. And so he was
[00:18:11] living. And we had a few words and he did not see me off to the airport, my mother did. And then fast
[00:18:20] forward to bootcamp. Then again, had, I'd give me some advice like a, you can turn this around
[00:18:29] in the Marine Corps. We'll give you every opportunity to do that. And so I crushed it in bootcamp,
[00:18:35] graduated on her man out of like, you know, 300 kids. And on graduation day or the day
[00:18:40] prior, you know, the bands can come out and see you in the lineup, the entire group of
[00:18:46] Italian and low and behold, who's in front carrying the guy down, me. And that's the one time,
[00:18:52] you know, me and my father did not get along in high school because again, not his fault.
[00:18:57] You just see him doing this and shaking his head. And you ever since that, that time, my father and I
[00:19:03] see each other in a different light, we still clash because we were still alike. But we, you know,
[00:19:11] we've got a common understanding and he's just a good man. My parents are good folks. I could,
[00:19:16] you know, I was never in want for love, for discipline and in the straw house, what was a great
[00:19:22] household? It's weird, too, because as a parent, you're always thinking,
[00:19:28] if you try and impose too much on your kids, you're just going to, you're just going to
[00:19:32] push him in the other direction, you know what I'm saying? So, you know, for instance, your dad could have
[00:19:38] been like, no, you're not joining it and you would have been so rebellious to probably have
[00:19:41] joined anyways and done, you know, then you would just not got along even more, but he had to just
[00:19:46] be like, okay, I'm not going to see you off, but I'll be there graduation. Do you know, I'll
[00:19:51] put you this way. I love the Marine Corps. Best run service. I'll be at the small service,
[00:19:57] best run service in the U.S. military. You just can't debate that. And I think what he saw
[00:20:06] was he sent a boy off in, like within three months he saw the beginning of a man. And I mean,
[00:20:13] he loved it. He took it on wholesale. He loved it so much that he would pass by a recruiting office.
[00:20:18] He'd stop, get some donuts and bring him into the office and check your hands. I mean,
[00:20:24] he loved the military at this point. He sought from a different area. We literally changed his
[00:20:29] experience and Vietnam to a favorable one. Yeah, the Marine Corps has really just mastered that whole
[00:20:36] thing of taking a recruit and turning them into a Marine. They don't really could at that. They are
[00:20:41] really good. It's awesome. I think I already said about the Marine Corps as there's,
[00:20:47] you know, in the sealed teams, you'll get these totally great guys at the high end of the spectrum.
[00:20:52] And you'll get a lot of worse guys at the lower end of the spectrum. The Marine Corps, it just keeps
[00:20:56] it all in a much tighter group. Like you know what you're getting. It's going to be, it's going to be a
[00:21:00] Marine and it's going to be good to go. You're talking about like they're minute and a thingle. Yeah,
[00:21:05] minute and a thingle. It's a tight shot group. The sealed teams, you know, we get some, we get some
[00:21:11] awesome guys for sure, but then you get a couple of scatter around the center. A couple of stray rounds
[00:21:16] that are off paper. Don't worry about that little guy. Yeah. Yeah. So, so then what year was this now?
[00:21:23] Is this like 1998? 1998. So, so glad I came in before 9-11 because I got to see the pre-war military
[00:21:33] and then you know, became what I call the the GWAT babies that were absolutely spoiled. In the sounds,
[00:21:38] you know, contradictory is spilled by war. Yeah, yeah. So, what would you do in
[00:21:45] what would you, what was your MLS? So, winning as a Jesus, I'm even forgetting it, uh,
[00:21:53] O311 riflemen check. But so when I was at the school of imagery, these
[00:21:59] re-con Marines show up and you can always tell the re-con Marines that they have the dual cool,
[00:22:02] the double treble and the hairs a little longer and they stand a little taller and, uh,
[00:22:09] so unbedass me, they literally had to try out that day and so that was my opportunity to get into
[00:22:17] re-con early and I did extremely well finish first within that class and they're like, okay,
[00:22:24] do you want to go re-con? I said yes, absolutely. And so out of the school of imagery,
[00:22:28] when I graduated from there, it was straight to the basic, constant scores, right next to Buds.
[00:22:33] Wow. In Coronado for three months. How many guys get to go straight through that pipeline like that?
[00:22:38] So, you know, it had to be inflowed. Usually you had to do some infantry time before you tried out,
[00:22:43] but I think, you know, similar to the demands of post 9-11 when we started out, or the Green
[00:22:50] Brake community started opening up the 18x program for guys straight off the street into the special forces,
[00:22:55] recon would occasionally do the same thing. And so very few and I just happened to hit,
[00:23:00] at an opportune time, past the screening and I'll tell you what, BRC was tough and I have nothing
[00:23:08] but respect for those guys. It's not, they don't have a hell week, but it is, it is man-town,
[00:23:16] and every respect. Yeah, nice to see those guys. Obviously we see them all the time going through classes.
[00:23:21] And then, so, and then you show up, where'd you go? Where'd you go after that? So, first
[00:23:25] recon of Italian, I can't pedal thin. Yeah. It was quickly thrown into schools. It was awesome.
[00:23:31] So, got dive school right off the bat, which is the Marine Combat and dive course in Panama,
[00:23:36] City Florida, which was, I'll tell you what, and most seals don't like to hear this.
[00:23:41] It was as tough as second phase, if not tougher. And even academically, they, they dove in a
[00:23:48] lot deeper to the dive physics, the dive medicine. So, you had guys getting dropped for academics.
[00:23:56] And then after that, it was shortly off to sniper school, which I was ill prepared for.
[00:24:01] I loved. I remember my mom, I went back to San Francisco, because that, a week and often,
[00:24:07] and you had a build-room gilly suits. And I built the worst gilly suit that you probably have ever seen.
[00:24:13] I still have the thing in stores. It looks like Chabaka. Line on the ground.
[00:24:19] But past that school, by the skin of my teeth. And I think we started with 40 and we graduated 12.
[00:24:25] And it literally came down to the last stock and a guy named Brian from Idaho who had been with
[00:24:32] a stay-upletoon in the Marine Corps, which is more or less a sniper button. And literally helped
[00:24:39] me get in my last position and sacrificed himself, because he didn't need to score a per score
[00:24:43] in that run and passed. But I made up for it, you know, the shooting, the shooting was not a problem.
[00:24:52] It was just stocking, since I had no real preparatory work going in, and those guys had, it was
[00:24:57] tough. How was your patient's level during stocking? Was it good? It was decent.
[00:25:05] The problem was we went to sniper school in January, California, which is cold. And so we were out there,
[00:25:10] all the time, sometimes rain. And so the patient's was fine, it was just the pain of sitting there,
[00:25:17] which you had to contend with. And then you go into employment? No. So did an entire work up
[00:25:27] and actually shifted over to another bitoon, because I was at first reconbetalion, and it was a company
[00:25:32] at the time, and we turned into a battalion when I was there. So I transferred from 7-platoon to
[00:25:37] a new bitoon and continued to work up and had a great officer, pulled me aside and he was like,
[00:25:44] hey man, I want to put you in for the meat set program, which again is the Marine and LISTED
[00:25:49] Commissioning Education Program. For listeners, that's where they send an active duty Marine
[00:25:53] usually a corporal sergeant or staff sergeant to go back and get their college degree on the Marine
[00:25:59] Corps done and then come back as an officer. It's because you've shown some promise. What I say is,
[00:26:05] I'd only been in two alcohol-related incidents in the Marine Corps. And so they said, hey, you're
[00:26:11] a officer. But the officer put me in, I filled out the package and got selected as a corporal.
[00:26:22] Very early in my career. And so when they asked me where I wanted to go, I wanted to go to
[00:26:28] the University of Texas. Did not get in, because what's the track back? They looked at the
[00:26:33] high school directors and like, I know. And so believe it or not, I had been to a wedding in Austin.
[00:26:40] What are my recon buddies and love the town? And the same guy looked at me and he's like, hey,
[00:26:46] man, what, what are you trying to text saying in? It's like, it's like the next best thing. It's only
[00:26:51] about an hour and a half outside of Austin. I'm like, okay, all right. And of course, I'm a
[00:26:55] corporal at the time. I don't have the money to go visit Texas saying them. Internet was not exactly
[00:27:02] booming at that time. And so I just submitted an application to actually some Marines that were
[00:27:07] there called me and they made it sound like a great place. And so when I went out there,
[00:27:12] drove out there with my three boxes of household goods. And it is just a country down
[00:27:21] with 50,000 college students. And it was a great opportunity. But college station was not for me.
[00:27:28] And the war had kicked off. And so I finished school in three years and got out of there.
[00:27:35] And then how did you go from, at what point did you tell them you wanted to join the Navy?
[00:27:40] So you know, going out there, I had about a 75% it already made my decision that I wanted to switch
[00:27:47] over to the seals. Even if you looked at it from a time perspective, had I gone to TBS and then
[00:27:54] officer and three quarters, it would have taken me the same amount of time to get to a seal team.
[00:27:59] And so it just made common sense. I'd worked with a few seals during the workups,
[00:28:04] the media workups at first week on the time. They were older, statistically,
[00:28:11] more highly educated, more physically fit in the biggest part. They were part of the so-called
[00:28:17] they had the money. I was still carrying an M1682 as a reconnery, Mr. Niber.
[00:28:23] We just didn't have the money we didn't have the gear. And so you never see seals
[00:28:28] switch from the seal team to re-gone. But you see a lot of re-connery and switch over to
[00:28:33] so-called community that you go seal, green beret, and a lot of them went pg.
[00:28:38] Which for the listeners is a Air Force pair rescue jumper.
[00:28:43] So I did go to Marino C.S. and I got to tell you again that was a challenge. I lost. I think I went
[00:28:52] in and around probably 185 and lost about 20 pounds that it didn't need to to lose. So that was a
[00:28:58] summer in Quanico and I was impressed and you talk about maintaining that standard, that quality
[00:29:04] spread that the Marine Corps does so well. Especially within their also ranks. That's the reason.
[00:29:11] How long is Marine Corps OCS? Three months. And how did if you knew you wanted to go in the
[00:29:18] Navy, how come they sent you to Marine Corps OCS? So the MECET program you actually go to OCS
[00:29:23] after the first summer, after your freshman year, you still come back as a sergeant. It was a sergeant
[00:29:29] at that time. Continue towards your degree in what you finished your degree. Then you get your
[00:29:34] commission. One year prior, and here's the fun thing. So when you're prior to graduating and
[00:29:39] said, hey, went to my Marine officer in the structure who's a major, who's a prior,
[00:29:44] and listed guy himself, great guy. I'm like, I think I want to go see all of this. I was like,
[00:29:48] okay, let's put a package in. It was like the military's going to get their pound of flesh from
[00:29:52] either way. Do what you want to do. The commanding officer was Marine Colonel. Did not see that way.
[00:29:58] I was disloyal. So during the process of the training, the Marine Corps, pretty much.
[00:30:05] I literally ate you. The major, brought me to get, he's like, I just listen to what he has to say.
[00:30:12] Not your head and just step out of the room, I got you. And so the inner service transfer was
[00:30:19] almost immediately improved. It was that easy of a process. But then it only I needed to
[00:30:25] attend something called out mini buds. That's summer of my junior year. And so when I show up,
[00:30:32] you have about 35 midshipmen from Naval ROTC units, the Naval Academy. And then one sergeant
[00:30:40] in his Marine Charlias. And it is, you know, khakis, khaki top with blue bottoms with a red stripe.
[00:30:50] And I'm amongst 34 guys in white and I just took out and it was gotty highway. So gotty highways
[00:30:58] in our course. And I was still very much sergeant. So they did love me towards the end. Because
[00:31:05] like they said, hey, we need this done. I'll let's step up. Yeah, hey fellas, let's get this done.
[00:31:11] And the guys sort of rallied around me and you know, low and behold at the end of that, I had
[00:31:16] a spot waiting for me when I graduated. And it didn't hurt that the the C.O. of buds was a former
[00:31:23] Marine himself. Oh yeah, yeah, that's that's awesome. It's a good way to get that. And there
[00:31:28] the primaries that come in the teams are always getting a little extra squared away,
[00:31:33] this inside them in their brain and buds any factor of buds. Just anyone goes for buds and says
[00:31:40] it's an infected non-factor. Well, it was the biggest factor you had. Patients. It was
[00:31:46] patients. I asked you about patients. Yeah. It's night before school. What were you in
[00:31:48] face or with? So you in sniper school, I was still new guy. Oh yeah, that's right. So you stepping
[00:31:55] into a community that I highly admired that I want to be a part of was the easy part. It was
[00:32:01] some of the instructors out of there were very artistic and getting on your skin. Yeah.
[00:32:07] And so one year is it now? Now when is it? Oh yeah. Oh, sorry. So it's game time. In fact,
[00:32:15] I think you you were deployed right around that time. Yeah. Well, I was deployed in
[00:32:21] 2003, 2004. My first deployment to Iraq. Yeah. Because you're counterpart,
[00:32:25] you're your sister-in-commander visited me. Okay. And buds, it was right before you guys went.
[00:32:30] All right. And which I have before you started about a jatzy when you came to speak to us.
[00:32:38] So you know, the just the patients are going through the process. Yeah. You and you went through
[00:32:42] jatzy? You did. Okay. I did not remember that. That's weird. So you had you a little bit in
[00:32:51] patient of going through buds. Like basically you're saying, I'm animating to get in the game.
[00:32:56] And they're like, okay, take this sweep this grinder and do all this dumb stuff that you have to do.
[00:33:01] Yeah. 100%.
[00:33:04] It's uh. When people ask me because people ask me all the time, hey, I'm 33 years old. I want to go
[00:33:08] in the military. Do you think it's a good idea? I'm always like, here's the problem. The problem is
[00:33:12] you're 34 years old. There's some real benefits that in that year mature and you are smart.
[00:33:17] And you have knowledge about the world. Here's the bad part. Your mature, your smart
[00:33:22] guy. You have knowledge about the world because when they're like, hey, we want you to do this completely
[00:33:26] ridiculous task that makes no sense whatsoever. You're not going to feel like doing it. And you're
[00:33:32] going to have to do it. And that's going to great on you even more. When I was 18 years old and I joined
[00:33:36] the Navy, it literally didn't matter what they made me do. I would like, well, like, what you just said,
[00:33:41] when you when you join the Marine Corps and when when Ben said, do you hey, look, you can you just
[00:33:46] do what they tell you to do and life's going to be good. You like, I didn't know and told me that,
[00:33:51] but when I got to boot camp, I was like, oh, I do what they tell me to do in life's going to be good.
[00:33:54] That's what's going to happen. So like, oh, you can fall down to where whatever clean the toilet,
[00:33:57] say, let's do this. And that's a lot easier when you're 18 than it is when you're 34. A lot easier.
[00:34:03] It is. And you know, it's not so much what they tell you to do. They tell you what to do, but they
[00:34:07] want to see if you perform. So now that we're trying to create robots and you know, a lot of people
[00:34:11] you have to demystify that about the military, but Buds is just a long process. And then while we're
[00:34:17] going through it, they're telling us stories about what you guys are doing overseas or, you know,
[00:34:21] we had one seal pass away in Afghanistan at the time. Someone received a Navy Cross in front of us.
[00:34:27] In the whole time, you want to be those guys. Not the metals or any of that, but you want to be
[00:34:32] the gladiator in the arena. And you know, you have 12 more months of training before you can even
[00:34:39] show up to the sea. The other the other big thing and you knew this because you've been in the
[00:34:44] market, the other big thing that people don't understand is the fear that we all had that this thing
[00:34:49] was going to end and we weren't going to do anything. That was the biggest fear I had. It was,
[00:34:55] this war is going to happen. It's going to be over in three months and I won't have deployed
[00:35:00] and off to do the rest of my Navy career never ever go, never go into combat, which was the the
[00:35:05] biggest nightmare I can imagine. Total nightmare. That would have been, it's the same for the
[00:35:10] guys that were in the Gulf War. You know, certain platoons got to go over there. Yeah. And they sat
[00:35:15] behind thinking that they were going to backfill them and the war was going to be a long war.
[00:35:19] And then it's over in what six days. Yeah. I had a master cheat friend that was on the last plane
[00:35:24] to be the last platoon going to Vietnam and the plane got shot down and they didn't go. So I
[00:35:30] can do total nightmare for them. But it's hard for people to understand that mentality of how bad you
[00:35:37] want to go. And it's just the way it is, man. I wish there was some nice thing to say about it
[00:35:42] or some psychological way to explain it away like, hey, it's just, no, it's like, I'm just going
[00:35:47] to say the way it is. When you're young and you're in the military, you want to go to war
[00:35:50] that's all there is to it. I'm sorry. I'm, that's the way it is. But you believe. You believe
[00:35:56] in what you are doing. There's a sense of purpose. And again, it is counterintuitive that anyone
[00:36:01] would want to go to combat. I'm super stoked that you feel that way. I'm going to hear to tell
[00:36:06] you and admit to you that like, I just wanted to go to war. I just wanted to go to war. I actually
[00:36:14] another old Vietnam guy, he, when he left Silti in one, he goes, he goes, I joined the Navy in 1970,
[00:36:20] so I could kill people for my country. And I was like, oh yeah, I don't what he's talking about.
[00:36:24] And the funny thing is, you start to love it. You start to love war. Oh yeah.
[00:36:31] And that's not a bad thing. You're funny. If I took a job right when I retired,
[00:36:35] a Texas A&M system was the director of veteran services for all 12 campuses. But there's this sort of
[00:36:41] old hand that, a mother hand that dude, that just didn't really like me. She leans in. She's like,
[00:36:49] what is the worst part about war? And I look at her and say, that it has to end. And just watch right
[00:36:57] up. Yeah, you can hear that. It's the classic line that they got right in the apocalypse now is when
[00:37:05] Colonel Kilgors, he just, he's just, he's just, he's just, he's talking about the
[00:37:09] bomb in the morning. And that smell, that gasoline smell, the whole hill, smell like
[00:37:16] victory. And someday this war's going to end. And that's the worst thing he can think of.
[00:37:22] Because hey, man, he's a battalion commander of the cavalry unit, Vietnam, he's got.
[00:37:27] He's on top of the world. He's on top of the world. There's nothing more important in the
[00:37:30] world than ever. He can't even imagine it. And he's depressed that someday the war's going to end.
[00:37:37] Fire it up. Yeah, yeah. So, so where were we? So you get done with buds, buds, the biggest thing
[00:37:44] people always ask about the physical part of buds. You're in good shape. No factor.
[00:37:48] Yeah, yes, it is physically exhausting. Of course. Yeah, what do you want to be? You get tired.
[00:37:53] But you know what it is? All too is that it's an opportunity to actually start submitting your reputation.
[00:37:59] And again, I was very much still sergeant in the instructors of love me. Because I would rally the boys.
[00:38:07] Even, you know, what I like to call a healthy appetite or healthy disrespect for authority
[00:38:13] is to get the guys fired up against them a little bit. And they get pay a little bit, you see
[00:38:17] I'm smoking the oil. All right, so it's worth the price. So, and again, you know,
[00:38:21] get the fire and they got the boys love me. They, they, they rout around me.
[00:38:26] Officer, you got the fire of the gut? Yeah, I haven't heard that too much. Have you heard that too much?
[00:38:30] You, I don't know. I haven't heard that too much. I,
[00:38:33] caveat or what is it called? I don't know for you what it's called. But I had one of my buddy's
[00:38:37] texts me that I, you're, you're making it sound like buds is super easy. It's not easy. And I was like,
[00:38:42] no, no, no, no, let me, let me correct myself. I'm not saying buds is easy. Like you said,
[00:38:46] buds is hard. It's, it's physically hard. The hardest thing to me, I think physically is that it
[00:38:51] goes on day after day after day after day after day after day. And so when you're doing a
[00:38:55] formal time, run, which should be pretty easy, because in first phase, you got 32 minutes do that.
[00:38:59] That's a long, that's a slow pace, even for a grown man. That's a slow pace, even for a big guy.
[00:39:04] That's a slow pace. But when you've done whatever 8,000, 8 count body builders the day before
[00:39:09] and then you got up at three in the morning and you did 8 million flutter kicks and then you go out
[00:39:13] and get on the beach and you do a time run and solve same with boots on, it's not easy. And that's
[00:39:18] what, that's what trips people up. I think the grind. The one thing too for me that was that was a
[00:39:24] driver is there was no way that I was going to disrespect the Marine reconnaissance community.
[00:39:32] No way. There are some warriors. I mean, there's a lot of warriors within that community. And so that
[00:39:38] was always over my head. No way was I didn't bring that down. That would just be a complete,
[00:39:45] a complete, utter lack of respect for the community I can't from.
[00:39:47] The quitting in Buds is really hard to understand. And I had like a mid-life crisis several months ago
[00:39:55] about because some people that I knew about and that I talked to had quit and like I didn't get it.
[00:40:05] And there's been guys from the Marine Corps that have gone through that I've been like, oh,
[00:40:10] that's awesome. And then they go in and you're thinking yourself, how does this even happen?
[00:40:15] So I'm 100% on board with the thought that no one knows who's going to make it through. No one knows.
[00:40:23] Like you can't say this guy is going to make it. He's a stud or this person's not going to make it
[00:40:28] because they're weak. You literally don't know. Now could I bat 60%, maybe 70%, maybe, but there's
[00:40:35] no way you could make a sure thing. There's not one person in the world that you could say.
[00:40:39] This guy is going to make it through Buds 100%. There's no person in the world you can say that about
[00:40:44] that I know of. The most humbling lesson I learned in Buds, and you're going to find this funny,
[00:40:50] was I went through Buds with a guy named Ryan Job, Sound familiar. And again, remember, I'm
[00:40:57] I was a really fired up Marine Sergeant that just pinned on bars. And from Judge in a book by
[00:41:06] it's covered, you look around and you're like, you're not going to make it. Everything was sloppy about
[00:41:09] him. And I even told him that one boy in my head man, you're not going to make it. She quit now.
[00:41:17] And just to watch him and the instructor zeroed in on him and the kid had no quit. And even at the
[00:41:25] end of the hell week having been beat more than anyone in that class, the instructor was actually
[00:41:32] pulled him aside and they said, hey, you're good to go. We've thrown everything at you in the
[00:41:37] kitchen sink and used to trough. There's going to be a great seal. And I watched that and I'm like,
[00:41:45] oh man, you know, I, who am I to judge who's going to make it? And that was it. That was a
[00:41:51] life lesson I still remember. I wasn't until Remadi that I apologize to Ryan. He, he's sort of
[00:41:58] getting on this second. Yeah, I know. He's like, you all thought I wasn't going to make it. Yeah,
[00:42:02] like you said, though, no zero quit. Zero quit. And it doesn't matter what you do to me. I'm going to be
[00:42:08] straight here. So then you get done, you get done with Buds. So I came and talked to your
[00:42:15] Jocce class. What I talked to you guys about? You said you, you and your task unit commander,
[00:42:19] okay, I came and talked about the deployment. It's awesome. But there's a a narrow, it's on the second
[00:42:24] deck, the classroom for junior officer training course, which I eventually took over for, for
[00:42:28] life later on. There's a narrow passageway and this task unit commander for Jocco and Jocco coming
[00:42:36] off his particular mentor had this, we're standing like this and they created a little lane. And
[00:42:41] as each of us walk through, Jocco would lean in and basically make you shimmy through. Yeah.
[00:42:47] That's a lot with this guy right off the bed. Right off the bed right. Right.
[00:42:52] This guy is an A hole. Like screw this guy. Now you want us to listen to you. And I mean,
[00:42:57] naturally, yeah, he's a physically intimidating dude, but like you, you really like screw that guy,
[00:43:03] man. I don't remember that at all. Sorry, bro. I was going to find what new guys though. It didn't
[00:43:10] stop there and we'll get to the next encounter. And then you showed up, you went right to T, you went,
[00:43:16] you go right to team three after that. I did showed up in November of 2004.
[00:43:24] And there was three slots open for J.O.s immediately and they went to all of the
[00:43:31] kind of me guys. And I got stuck in hops. Working with a great guy. Right off that we both know.
[00:43:38] And I absolutely looked out for me and so sent me to free fall right away and then when I
[00:43:43] finished that up he's like, hey, do you want to go join the boys over CX? Because Team Threw is
[00:43:47] to plug the time. I'm like, yeah. So it was, you know, shortly after December found myself on a
[00:43:54] plane and arrived in Baghdad and balling. I was finally in the game. I was there. That's after battle.
[00:44:02] And I loved it. Yeah. And then what were you doing just tagging along with the boys? So yeah,
[00:44:07] they gave you some strange job description. But it just meant hang out and wait to go on all this.
[00:44:13] So we're going in the job. Naturally, as an assistant operations officer. But there was another
[00:44:19] shield team that was there. Remember they were doing a good one since I'd killed Team Threw. And
[00:44:25] fell in with the two commander quickly. And he's like, hey, jump on the humvies. You're a 50
[00:44:31] cow gunner. When we go out, just watch us do our thing, you know, set up a court on with the vehicles
[00:44:39] and slowly learn. And so every time they would go out, I would jump in the the the humvies.
[00:44:43] It was a 50 cow gunner. And I was in heaven. Yeah. I was in absolutely
[00:44:47] never getting even. And it was freaking stoked. Yeah. And then you came back so you come home from that
[00:44:53] deployment and then you get put into, is it, did you get a platoon? The next time where you like,
[00:44:58] did you get stuck being an ops again in that task unit? So I get yeah, I got stuck. This is like
[00:45:03] good deals for good seals. Yeah. I got stuck as to you Charlie, uh, ops. Oh, get some. And so again,
[00:45:13] other slots were full. Uh, I'd have to wait for an AYC. It would mean I still get to deploy. I actually
[00:45:18] it's a double benefit when you look at it at the end of the day. I actually get two deployments.
[00:45:22] Those guys after they're done with their assistant, but two commander or step up. How to go elsewhere.
[00:45:27] And so it actually was a blessing in, uh, in disguise. And then, okay. So you're in that task unit.
[00:45:33] And it, interestingly, that task unit is in the book extreme ownership in a very short passage.
[00:45:38] And I was looking at it to think about what we said about it. But there was a task unit at
[00:45:43] sealed team three at the time. And the task unit commander and one of the platoon commanders,
[00:45:50] they didn't get along. They had issues with each other. And they couldn't, they couldn't put it
[00:45:56] aside. They just couldn't put it aside. And even the commanding officer, again, this is in the book.
[00:46:01] And the commanding officer said, hey, look, I'll tell you what. I know you two have issues.
[00:46:06] Because they had both come to them separately and I'm probably screwing up the story. But it was
[00:46:09] something like this. They both came to them and said, hey, look, I can't work with this guy. The other
[00:46:12] guy says, I can't work with this guy. And he brings them together and says, look, it's Friday.
[00:46:17] By Monday, come in here and tell me how you two are going to work together. Understand? And they're
[00:46:22] like, yeah, I got it, sir. They come in Monday. And what do they say? I can't work with him. I can't
[00:46:26] work with him. And he goes, okay, you guys can't work together. Guess what? You're fired. And he fired
[00:46:29] both of them, which was a, which was a great move actually. I thought, I think it was a good move. You know,
[00:46:35] if you've got two people that can't figure out how to work together under the threat of being fired
[00:46:41] from your job, that's a real problem. Especially if you can't substantiate it. I mean, if you can't go
[00:46:46] in there and say, listen, here's the reasons why I can't work with this guy to this and this.
[00:46:49] Because obviously, they had the opportunity to do that. And there's situations where you can say,
[00:46:52] look, I can't work with this guy. He's a moral or his unethical or he treats everyone horribly. And
[00:46:57] I can't sit there and watch this happen. Like there's reasonable arguments that you could make where
[00:47:02] you literally can't work with someone. But when you can't even substantiate an argument as to why
[00:47:06] you can't work with someone. And then you get told, okay, I get it. And I don't hear any real reasons.
[00:47:11] So you two go figure it out. And you come back and say, no, it can't, it's not happening.
[00:47:16] Seems to me like a good move is okay. Neither one of these guys. I trust to go overseas and
[00:47:19] form relationships with other military units and foreign military units and do their job properly.
[00:47:25] And he fired them both. You somehow, they said, okay, you know what, collateral damage we're
[00:47:32] going to take. So, really, we're going to move them into task in a bruiser. That's what they did.
[00:47:37] And I was stoked because I wanted more people, always, you know, because you get another 50
[00:47:42] calagoner. You get another officer, you get another shooter. You get another person. It's awesome.
[00:47:46] And I was stoked to have you coming on board. And there was, there was like a little bit of
[00:47:51] a dr, I mean, there was drama because, you know, inside, inside bruiser was like no drama. Like
[00:47:56] we don't, we don't play drama. Like we solve problems, we keep our mouth shut, we do what we're
[00:48:00] supposed to do. We, if we got problems, we figure them out, we straighten them out and we move on.
[00:48:04] And we could see all this drama unfolding in that other task. And it, which is, is not cool. I mean,
[00:48:09] you don't like seeing that at a sealed thing. You want the whole sealed team to be kick ass.
[00:48:13] And so you see a, a task unit that's in turmoil. It's like not fun to watch. Especially because I knew
[00:48:18] I basically knew every player in there. I knew every one of those guys. And you watch them just
[00:48:23] fall on a part and eagles are flaring up and it's just a nightmare, man. It was a nightmare.
[00:48:27] And anyways, you get basically out of that whole catastrophe that outcomes Mike Sirelli and
[00:48:32] it to ask me to bruise her. And the best we're still, I've ever been dealt. Best we're still,
[00:48:38] I've ever been dealt. So you check in. And I remember I, I was thinking to myself, okay, I didn't
[00:48:44] know you. I looked at your record. I knew you were in the Marine Corps. I like I knew that you're
[00:48:49] going to be square away. That was my, that was my as much as you can predict. You know, I was
[00:48:53] thinking, okay, this guy was in the Marine Corps. This guy's going to be awesome. You seem like
[00:48:57] you were serious and you want to do good job. And so I was, my assumption was, you're going to kick
[00:49:02] ass. However, I had to be a little bit, you know, I had to do a little precautionary precautionary,
[00:49:08] it takes some precautionary measures to make sure that you understood where I was coming from.
[00:49:11] You know, I wanted to make sure you knew where I was coming from. While I had an a little
[00:49:16] fun with it. Just a little, just a smidge. Yeah. So that's why that's why we're so introducing
[00:49:23] you into the task, bringing you in. I wanted to let you know, like, hey, this is where I'm at.
[00:49:27] You know, we don't have any trouble here. That's why. So that's why we did the whole, uh,
[00:49:32] the whole briefing. So in the mechanical, so in the mechanical room. So at Sealtime 3 at the time,
[00:49:37] there was no ceilings. In any, they were doing this big remodel. And there was no ceilings in
[00:49:43] any of the pertune spaces or task unit spaces. There was all just, there was a wall with no ceiling.
[00:49:47] So you could hear everything that was being said. And so whenever I had something legitimate,
[00:49:52] like an issue to bring up with someone, and it was almost, it was, I'm factored, it wasn't even
[00:49:57] almost always. It was always my, my jail. So it was either life or Seth or one of the other
[00:50:03] jails. And I'd bring them in there. And I'd be like, hey, here's what's going on. Because in the mechanical
[00:50:07] room, there's like allowed noise. And no one can hear you. And that's the only room that still
[00:50:11] had a ceiling for privacy for privacy. It was like the cone of silence. Yeah. It was the cone of silence.
[00:50:15] So whenever someone was doing something that I really need to tighten up, someone was getting out
[00:50:20] of line. And I really needed to talk to him on the secret level. And by secret, I mean, I didn't want
[00:50:27] anyone to go out to speak about what I was about to say. So I'd bring them in the mechanical room
[00:50:31] and tell them what was up. And so that's what I, that's how I welcomed Mike into the task unit.
[00:50:35] Go ahead. Now you can get out of this mess. So you have you come out of the incident where
[00:50:41] I was wrapped up in a lot of a little bit of drama and being shifted. That incident, though,
[00:50:46] you were just sort of like in that group or were you, you know? So since I was close, the operations
[00:50:52] officer, which is basically the guy that handles the the day-to-day affairs, the troop commander,
[00:50:57] I was naturally close to him. And if you want to step back to that task unit, because it was one of the,
[00:51:03] again, many great leadership lessons across the course of my career for a new guy watching that
[00:51:09] in the SEAL teams, it was, you know, I was questioned, maybe this community is not from me. If this
[00:51:16] is the norm, because that, this is my first experience. So this means this is normal to me.
[00:51:22] It just seemed like backstabbing and he goes, one of the potoons they performed and they stayed
[00:51:28] out of the drama for the most part, but between this particular commander and the task unit commander,
[00:51:32] it was from day one. It was just like watching a train derail, you just saw it coming.
[00:51:38] In the fact that the boss laid down the rule and they come back on Monday morning and paint
[00:51:45] him into a corner, I don't know what they expected. And they both got fired and it both affected
[00:51:52] their career, but it was a great, you know, I actually, I can say as a new guy, it was a great
[00:51:57] thing to see in retrospect, because you learned what not to do. But when I was told to report into
[00:52:03] Jaco, you know, I'm not in the best of spirits and not in the door to task unit bruiser
[00:52:12] and say, hey, Mike's really Jaco, I'm here to report in and he said Roger, come with me and
[00:52:17] he had a sheet of paper in his hand. Pretty cool. I was like, what's going on?
[00:52:22] So I follow him into everyone knows what the mechanical room is, but nobody goes in.
[00:52:26] Oh, man. I mean, you just want to picture like dogs turning. Yeah, just loud. Just steam coming out.
[00:52:34] Nightmare and L.M. Street. That's a pretty good thing. Yeah, it did. That's a good thing.
[00:52:38] You actually told me to pop, too. And so I pop, too. And you basically lay down the law of,
[00:52:45] hey, I heard what happens. You have clean sight here, but do not bring drama into my task unit.
[00:52:51] Here's your counseling sheet. You've been formally counseled and pretty much left the room.
[00:52:56] And I think I sat in the room for 30 seconds to him. And I'm just staring the wall like what?
[00:53:04] Mike, Mike, my career in the sealed teams is going to be extremely short.
[00:53:08] I'm getting it from all directions. And what he did was you lay down the law.
[00:53:13] And I understood there was just one thing to do with that point. That was just before.
[00:53:17] Yeah, it was before. Yeah, the other backstory here is, is that the platoon that you're talking
[00:53:21] about that performed well inside that task unit, the platoon chief and that, because he was
[00:53:26] here's one of my good friends from way back. And because there's all this strave voltage going around
[00:53:31] about who's fault this was. And he came up to me and he goes, hey, you're getting sorelly. And I was like,
[00:53:36] yeah, he goes, he's fucking good to go. And I was like, check. And that's like literally all I needed to hear.
[00:53:40] Because when he told me that, I knew like he's got respect to his opinion. And so I actually knew
[00:53:46] you're going to be good to go a little bit stronger than I gave no to. Now he was, in terms of
[00:53:54] first people you meet in the sealed teams was absolutely welcoming to every new guy. No hazing
[00:53:59] whatsoever. You can perform as a new guy. You're a part of this platoon you have a voice. And once
[00:54:06] he found out, because he's a sniper found out, I was a sniper at the Marine Corps. He's like, go,
[00:54:10] hey, I'm making a call alarm right now. Go check out a suite of guns. And I was shocked. And you know,
[00:54:17] I trained up as a sniper as an officer for the entire workout. And it was because of that one guy
[00:54:23] who welcomed me with open arms and despite his long history and the teams, I mean, no ego whatsoever.
[00:54:31] This humble awesome guy. So you're giving him that paper, the formal counseling. That's like,
[00:54:37] uh, isn't that something you normally do if you get in trouble, some officially go to the
[00:54:41] new or reprimand. So you just need to make a straight up impression. Like, hey,
[00:54:45] you're in trouble. By the way, I probably wrote in my entire naval career
[00:54:51] less than five. I might have written three maybe. So he didn't even do anything. Yeah. I know I had to
[00:54:58] give one to lay for one time. Like my, my, uh, my, my late, late, late, late, late, late,
[00:55:05] did something. And the exo was like, you need to write him up. And I was like, definitely sir.
[00:55:12] And so I wrote him up. And then I shredded it later or whatever. You know, it was like, not,
[00:55:15] but there's a very few times that I actually did that. But again, we're getting you late. It was
[00:55:21] pretty late. We were going on the deployment soon. And so it was like, okay, let's, let's get some
[00:55:25] you know, set the, you know, set the expectations. Yeah. They're in the front, you know,
[00:55:29] they were not playing around. And then we go on deployment, we go to a
[00:55:33] Romadi. We, well, we guessed before we did that. We did certax and all that kind of,
[00:55:38] the last little bit of training. And then we went on deployment to a Romadi.
[00:55:41] No, I did not. I joined the after certax. I literally joined you three weeks before we
[00:55:47] deployed. Good. God. So I was that fresh to task in a bruiser. No relationships,
[00:55:51] with a few guys that I got into a, to buzz with actually. So remember Mark Lee and I transferred
[00:55:57] over the same. Yeah. Yeah. That was after certax. Wow. Are you sure? Mark might have been before.
[00:56:05] I was after. Okay. Yeah. I think Mark was before. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because, oh, that's right.
[00:56:09] Because everything fell apart in certax for you guys. But your certax was before us. That's right.
[00:56:14] It was, we, we, we come back to some panel. Yeah. That's when the proverbial shit hit the fan
[00:56:18] within that basket. And so then, Jay, we're getting ready to go to Romadi. And what, what,
[00:56:25] what, you, you came, you became, what did you become? Like, like, because I had a guy that was the,
[00:56:31] the task in an ops, did I make you task unit assist enough? Custom lead a motive. That was the beginning
[00:56:39] of my second career. I was too, I was the aops. But quickly became, let me, let me tell you something.
[00:56:45] This is a, this is a great, a great point because all that, like, basically, you know what that is?
[00:56:50] Really? It's like a test. Like, I'm gonna write you up. Let's see what you're attitude is.
[00:56:54] You attitude is, you know what it is attitude is like, Roger. I'm, no drama. Don't worry about it.
[00:56:58] Then it's like, okay, you're gonna work for this other guy. That's probably lower and
[00:57:01] rank than you that has been in the military for a year. And you're gonna work for him. How do you,
[00:57:05] how do you take that? And you know what Mike's attitude is like, Roger that? I'm here to work.
[00:57:08] Those things, like, when you, when those things happen, because people ask me this,
[00:57:11] that kind of question all the time. Well, you know, someone else got promoted or someone else got this.
[00:57:14] It's like, what do you do? Oh, you work hard. That's, and that's exactly what you did. And, you know,
[00:57:19] it took a matter of days before I was thinking, okay, he's all given a little bit more. I'll give
[00:57:23] a little bit more, I'll give a little bit more, I'll give a little bit more. And then very shortly,
[00:57:26] thereafter, it's like, okay, guess what? You are ops now, which is not like this huge, great job,
[00:57:31] but it's, it's, it's pretty significant. Once we're on the ground in Ramadi, there's a lot of
[00:57:35] responsibility there. Like, how do count on you for a lot of stuff? And because you were,
[00:57:39] were freaking square away and we're like, okay, Roger that. No attitude. No, never did you,
[00:57:45] like, I gave you, and then we got overseas. I remember I gave you the worst job, which was I sent you
[00:57:50] to the TG, right? So the TG, for those of you that don't know too much about the military,
[00:57:56] there's a, there's a headquarters above the task unit, which is called, if the seal team, but when
[00:58:00] you're on deployment, it's called the task group. And they have all kinds of administrative
[00:58:06] stuff that they got a handle. And we, we had a great team with great support from our headshed,
[00:58:12] but they needed people to work. They need people to drive paperwork, is basically what they needed.
[00:58:17] And so they needed an officer to go over there for 30 days, for 30 days, and get, you know,
[00:58:26] work, do all this paperwork. And I had to submit an officer and I, I sent you. And there's two reasons
[00:58:32] why I did it. Well, number one, the number one reason why I did it was because I knew that you'd
[00:58:37] get there and figure things out and help us grease the skids for everything that we were doing,
[00:58:40] whereas if I sent someone else, they might be able to pull that off as well. And too, because I
[00:58:44] knew when I get you back, I could do something awesome with you, like, get you in the field,
[00:58:48] which is what I did. So yeah, if you're in those situations where you feel like you're,
[00:58:56] you deserve better. Yeah, just be quiet, suck it up, do a good job. And if you're,
[00:59:03] the other part that people get paranoid about is they think, well, they won't notice me. Yeah,
[00:59:08] they think, I should tell Jockel how awesome I am. I should tell Jockel that I was in the
[00:59:12] Marine Corps. I should tell Jockel that I, I'm a sniper. I should tell, like, hey, I got a better idea.
[00:59:17] How about you just be humble and just work? And if you do that, then Jockel says, oh, hey,
[00:59:23] man, this guy's square away. I wonder why he's so square away. I'm going to the character, I could
[00:59:26] always in the Marine Corps. Oh, let me look at his record. Oh, he's a sniper. Oh, he was in Recon.
[00:59:30] Oh, okay. I've got a pipe hitter here. Cool. I can use him and he's humble on top of all that,
[00:59:35] as opposed to, hey, look at me. Because believe me, there's plenty of people that come in and they
[00:59:39] want to bow up and act like they're the baddest guy on the planet. It's like, that's a real
[00:59:43] problem. That's a real problem. Because they have a big ego. It was to the point where I knew I'd
[00:59:49] burn my personal capital. And so it was time to rebuild. And even before he sent me to the
[00:59:54] disaster group, running an ops, quickly came at parent that the other guy that was ahead of me,
[00:59:59] just wasn't going to cut the bill. But a leaf had asked me if I wanted to go out and I'm like,
[01:00:05] yeah, everything in me wanted to go out on a mission with them. Because these guys are already
[01:00:10] starting to kill a lot of combatants. But I had worked to do in terms of ops that Jockel had
[01:00:16] passed down. And I knew if I'd went out, it wouldn't have gotten done. And you would have let me
[01:00:20] made that call. Yeah, you would have let me go. But I, you know, I passed. And you know, we were talking
[01:00:25] about that yesterday. I was with Lave and Texas. And he's like, I remember that one thing. And we knew
[01:00:30] that was a sign that you were going to get your stuff done. And he actually made the right call.
[01:00:35] And he still brings that into the... You know what you were doing? You were looking out for the
[01:00:39] task unit instead of looking out for yourself. That's what that is. You were looking out for the
[01:00:43] task unit instead of looking out for yourself. You were taking care of what your actual job
[01:00:47] was instead of taking care of yourself. And that's again, for everyone that's wondering like,
[01:00:51] how to act, that's how you act. You take care of the team before you take care of yourself.
[01:00:55] You stay humble. You don't think that you deserve more than you're going to get when you get
[01:00:59] handed a shit sandwich. Take a bite, chew it, and put a smile on your face and ask for another one.
[01:01:05] And make that one square to way too. And that's how that's how you're going to get where you
[01:01:09] want to go, which for you eventually meant going to join Geltel Potu. Awesome. Best experience I've
[01:01:17] ever had and again with a a patoon that is humble. And if there is a personification of that,
[01:01:23] that is JP to know. And those guys welcome me with open arms. And I was taken back by the
[01:01:29] by the humility. They're just sort of, you know, the way I described Geltel Potu is they were like
[01:01:34] the little guy. They were the little guy in Task Unit, Bruser. In the sense that they were just
[01:01:40] quiet with what they did. It's just different personalities between Charlie and Deltel. And you
[01:01:44] love both Bittons, but they had a very different style of leadership. And you know, I can't
[01:01:51] name any of the names because most of them are still in active duty, but it felt like home. And then
[01:01:57] being with Seth was educational, given the experience they had gotten within those like two months
[01:02:03] that wasn't there. Two and a half three months. And you know, there was a steep learning curve
[01:02:11] after three months gone after them. And I'm stepping in because I had to like speed up to the
[01:02:15] basically the speed of war because they were already there. Yeah, and they had a ton of experience at
[01:02:20] that point. I mean, it was insane amount of experience. The the first, at one point they did 24
[01:02:30] straight patrols into the mollab and got contacted every single time. And then one they didn't get
[01:02:35] contact. They were like way up in the northeast section. They didn't get contacted. And then the next
[01:02:40] time they went out, which was the day later they were right back in and again. So the amount of
[01:02:44] experience that they had was just was ridiculous. It was ridiculous. I remember so I was briefing
[01:02:51] the siege so-and-off. And I I've made that quote right there. And I was like, these guys have been
[01:02:56] in contact on their last 23, their last 23 operations. And the the talk watch officer comes
[01:03:02] walking in and he's like, sir, I was like, yes, and he was like, just want to let you know a
[01:03:07] decor eggot or is in a in a tick right now. And I was like, Roger that and I looked at the
[01:03:10] color and I said, make that 24. That was that was pretty awesome. We used to when those big
[01:03:19] wigs would come to visit us in Ramadi. We would we would attempt to make it all nice. But what
[01:03:29] that looked like was so obviously wretched that like we would say, hey, you know, we've we've got
[01:03:38] we'd layout the the mRE coffee for them. So like, hey, if you want to cup coffee, you're damn
[01:03:43] our coffee. And we've made it like we were doing our best to give them like the best treatment.
[01:03:47] But like the treatment that you're going to get just socks because we're out here in the middle
[01:03:50] of the room to supply chains. Not as good as it could be. And hey, if you want, hey, we will
[01:03:54] want you have coffee to have it. So here's a memory coffee. You can mix it up here. Get some.
[01:04:00] And then when they left, we cleared out the supply closet, put the coffee machines back up.
[01:04:04] The funny thing is you talked about the task route and during my time there is for those
[01:04:12] big ways that come in is it was such a deviation from what soft was doing and I rack prior to that.
[01:04:18] And you know, I like to, you know, use Colonel McFarland who you need to have on the show.
[01:04:23] Yeah, because the boss will use retired now, the tender general, the former commander of the
[01:04:29] one one brigade gone back to him. Is that he realized we weren't winning? We are not winning
[01:04:36] and to continue operations as we have been doing is the wrong call and things needed to change. And
[01:04:41] even at the task group loved the commander over us because it was a deviation from what every other
[01:04:48] seal team had done, you could see him struggling with whether it was a right call. And I remember a few
[01:04:53] times he called me in to ask my opinion about what was going on. But he wasn't really looking for an
[01:04:59] answer. He was using me just as a springboard for his own thought process. And so I would talk very
[01:05:05] little and he would just sort of keep on talking. And I mean, he had a very solid sort of thought process
[01:05:13] along the lines of how he justified it. And ultimately, you know, he looked out for you and the rest of
[01:05:20] the task units. Yeah, and they allowed us to look out for all the conventional forces that we were
[01:05:25] working with. Exactly. The one one AD and the first the five was six and the one three seven and
[01:05:29] three eight Marines and all those guys that were on the ground with us there who we were able to
[01:05:34] help out as much as as much as possible. Only because we got clearance to do those operations,
[01:05:38] which as you said was a was outside the norm, outside the norm daytime operations stay in out
[01:05:44] in the city, supporting conventional forces, which freaks some people out like, why would you be
[01:05:49] supporting them? They should be supporting you. It's like, well, no, they've got whatever
[01:05:52] a thousand soldiers and they're taking down a giant part of the city and we can help protect them.
[01:05:56] So we are a supporting element, but it's going to be it's going to have big impact. So it was
[01:06:02] uh, it was awesome. So when you got when you got out to correct door with the first the 506,
[01:06:11] how awesome is first the five, how awesome is first the 506? The first of the 506 from the top
[01:06:17] down were hardcore warriors. Yeah. Some of the strongest leadership. So now major general,
[01:06:26] uh, Ron McIrne, uh, I'm sorry, Ron Clark was the botanic commander of the Donald's
[01:06:30] Democratic Colonel, um, Dave Womack. I mean, I've never seen in my 20 years a stronger,
[01:06:38] soft conventional force relationship other than Romani. I mean, it was a textbook case
[01:06:47] of unity of effort. Nobody worked for the other, but they all worked in unity,
[01:06:52] towards the same uh, and state. And it was beautiful. And Ron Clark, of course, you know,
[01:06:59] Seth and all the boys, it's set that relationship up. They've done a wonderful job. And, um,
[01:07:03] the fact that, you know, I got out there before he bestowed the first of the 506 spade on them.
[01:07:09] And you know, I was there when he got bestowed upon us. Uh, it just, I mean,
[01:07:15] yeah, you know, I need to qualify this, you know, getting the try that was one of the biggest things,
[01:07:20] uh, one of the biggest accomplishments in my life, but they, it was just like a different sense
[01:07:24] of pride than who most rates up there that this bad ass, with Denny Colonel, that, that it been,
[01:07:31] you know, in the sock for so long, uh, bestowed a infamous, you know, uh, symbol on our shoulders
[01:07:39] and said, hey, you wear this in combat. And that was, I mean, there's very few words to describe
[01:07:45] how that felt. Yeah, that was, um, like you said, there was a relationship between, between everyone,
[01:07:51] between us, between everyone at the 118, it was just freaking awesome. And I don't know if
[01:07:57] we'll ever be able to capture that and describe it, um, but man, it was, it was awesome. And,
[01:08:04] and what they did for us, and we did whatever we could for them and what they did for us, man, was just
[01:08:10] the sacrifices that they made and the effort that they put forth to support what we were
[01:08:15] doing. It was, it was, it was awesome. It was just awesome. Talk about, um, just give like, hey,
[01:08:25] this is what we were doing. So people can hear from your perspective, like, again, you know,
[01:08:30] you don't need to get into tactics that, but just, hey, just a general, this is what we were doing.
[01:08:36] We were covering and moving with the first five of six. That's how I put it. We were covering
[01:08:41] and moving. Again, all in the, in pursuit of the same goal, it's win-remodied. And, um, we could
[01:08:47] stuck with the status quo with the, the nightly direct action raids, but it just had the
[01:08:51] little impact compared to what the, uh, the conventional's were doing. And they were going to go out.
[01:08:55] So we really utilized the skill set. That was unique to the seal teams, and that was the
[01:08:59] sniper overwatch. And, uh, you know, those positions, those sniper positions, because we would,
[01:09:04] again, we defied sort of traditional tactics of those two to four guys that went out, maybe six
[01:09:09] guys in a sniper hide, and we went out in force, fighting positions, fighting positions,
[01:09:15] because shortly, you know, after the first few kills from our, our snipers, um,
[01:09:21] quickly turned into a battle position, because they, they can sort of try and get late,
[01:09:25] where you're at, based off the, the body's land on the ground, and they had become very
[01:09:29] good at it. But we would move out, uh, ahead of the frontline trace of the 506 set up, uh,
[01:09:35] sniper overwatch, uh, mutually supporting sniper of a watch, uh, to really, uh, protect me,
[01:09:41] uh, conventional is doing major clearances throughout the Miloob district, and it was highly successful.
[01:09:46] Yes, did it mean we operated during the, uh, the days. Sometimes it did, uh, most often we would
[01:09:51] infiltrate at night prior to, uh, you know, use the advantage of, uh, of night to you, to, to your unit,
[01:09:58] uh, set up prior to the, uh, the conventional's coming in the early morning and starting the, uh,
[01:10:01] the clearance operations, and then we, you could pull out during the day or stay until night,
[01:10:07] just to, uh, give ourselves, uh, you know, mitigate risk as best possible. But, you know, you can't,
[01:10:13] are you, the numbers don't lie. You cannot, are you with the numbers that the cigarettes were going down,
[01:10:18] and to make a batons were, you know, killed were, were stacking up and slowly, you know,
[01:10:24] taking one body of the time of that elephant, we moved further and further into central
[01:10:29] Ramadi, which was, and me held territory, uh, up until 2006. And then from the other side,
[01:10:36] Charlie Patir, and it was coming in from the, from the Western side of Ramadi, and it was like,
[01:10:40] eventually we just all made it a little, and called it good. So, when you got over to Corregard,
[01:10:48] or, I mean, obviously you're working for Stoner when you first show up there. How's that?
[01:10:54] Stoner's great. Stoner is a very, uh, I don't know, the word,
[01:11:01] eclectic is a good way to describe them. So, for the audience, I mean,
[01:11:06] Cestone is a, is a Naval Academy graduate, highly intelligent, you know, the guy almost had a
[01:11:10] photographic memory, ended up, uh, you know, getting his, uh, his master's from Preston. So,
[01:11:15] clearly, three of the guys intelligent. Um, what, what are you saying about 6263?
[01:11:21] Yeah, he was a big dude. He was overly aggressive. Um, sort of had some extra tissue above his, uh,
[01:11:31] his eyebrows that sort of made him look like a, uh, a caveman. Um, but Stoner had a reputation of,
[01:11:40] of being, you know, just that aggressive. And that's what was needed in that position.
[01:11:45] But he wasn't reckless. And let me say that. He was, he was very methodical and diligent
[01:11:50] out, most of the decisions he made. And, um, you know, for any leader that the Burmne
[01:11:56] Command is, uh, is a lonely place. Your task came to Commander, you know, even though you're close
[01:12:01] with a late for in Jocca, uh, a late for not and Seth, you're, you're, you're also alone. And for Seth
[01:12:07] out there, all by himself, because, you know, um, Andrew had taken off, he was by himself and really
[01:12:14] had nobody to, to commensurate. And so I think, uh, when I get out there, you know, he was
[01:12:19] relieved to have an officer. That was, uh, you know, a little more aggressive, um, and confided,
[01:12:26] in me. And so I went everywhere with Seth every meeting for the first of the 506. Um,
[01:12:31] I think he was in a sense, relieved, you know, one of my strengths and, and it sucks to say this
[01:12:37] was I was actually a very good planner, very good planner. You know, I took a lot of pride in the
[01:12:42] fact that it was a sniper. And so I could do a lot of analysis, mission analysis going in,
[01:12:46] in Medigay, risk. And then I was very good at knocking out the products, uh, almost to my own
[01:12:50] demise and I'll get to that funny story. But Seth knew he could rely on me for the little things to
[01:12:56] get that done to clear the way for him to focus on the more strategic picture, what in the
[01:13:02] at the Battle of Monty. And so, um, you know, because I respected him for what he'd done up to that
[01:13:08] point, like very much in a sense, as a young seal, I was trying to earn his respect as well. And I
[01:13:15] think I did that towards Ian, is he knew he could rely on me. Um, and I think quickly out in the field,
[01:13:21] I proved my worth, um, to remember him an officer with a sniper rifle now and so I'm finally in the
[01:13:26] game as well. Um, but we grew extremely, extremely close to the point where he started to bounce off,
[01:13:34] you know, bounce a, matters off me for, for my opinion, before he weighed, weighed in, with some
[01:13:40] final decisions. Um, and he became a brother quite frankly. And, um, you know, when the, the, the
[01:13:47] the point was over, you know, led the way and making sure that he was sent off out of Delta
[01:13:51] between and in a fine fashion. You know, we got him out, uh, forgetting the pistol, but it was
[01:13:56] that he was in nice pistol. There was like a $2,000 pistol. Uh, the boys were happy to chip in. So
[01:14:01] we, we made sure that we sent Seth off with as much love as he showed the, uh, the boys. And
[01:14:06] let me, let me finish, you know, with Seth in that regard, he loved the guys. He would hold them
[01:14:14] accountable. But by all means, you know, he was close with guys, but he did not yet in the way of
[01:14:18] him making a decision. A right decision. Not what was best for the guys, but what was right for the
[01:14:25] guys, and he would make those hard decisions. And he didn't mind being on part two, I don't know if
[01:14:29] he did. Yeah, I owe, um, at some point I'll be talking a lot about him. Not now. So, now we're almost done
[01:14:49] with deployment. And, uh, you guys had a matter of, I don't know what to call it in terms of number
[01:15:00] of missions left. It might be zero. It might be one might be two. But it was almost time for everyone
[01:15:09] to start packing up and head and home. And that didn't mean that the first, the five of
[01:15:20] sex was going home because they weren't, didn't mean the one one. A. D. was going home because they
[01:15:23] weren't, didn't mean that they were going to stop doing it operations because they weren't
[01:15:26] and didn't mean that the enemy wasn't going to stop trying to kill Americans. And so,
[01:15:32] that meant that we couldn't stop doing what we had to do until the next seal team came into
[01:15:41] a leave us and take our place. So, there was no stopping. There was no stopping until it was
[01:15:50] time to go home. Um, closest we were. And I remember consciously, I said to myself,
[01:15:55] I'm not going to say, hey, this day will do our last mission because I think that's like
[01:16:03] a call me superstitious, but that to me is like a bad luck thing. Like, hey, okay, guys, this is the
[01:16:10] last mission. And even in my own mind, I said, okay, well, we'll see how this one goes and another mission
[01:16:15] comes up. And so, I never said to myself, okay, this day or this something we're going to stop.
[01:16:20] And I just knew that at some point we'd have enough of the new group over, the new team would be here.
[01:16:26] And we could say, okay, you know what? We're good now and we're going home. And I didn't want to make
[01:16:30] that a count. I didn't want to make that like a set date, you know, or a set time or a set number of
[01:16:36] missions. I just said, when we were ready to be relieved, we'll stop. We'll just stop and we'll
[01:16:41] pack up because I don't want guys out in the field thinking, hey, if I can just make it through
[01:16:46] this because that's bad or I don't want guys in the field thinking, this is the last one I got to do
[01:16:50] and I don't want that or anyone's mind, not even mind. And so I even tricked myself and just said,
[01:16:55] okay, we're going to keep going until we've got enough strength from the other team and then we'll
[01:16:58] just stop that when that day comes. So you guys kept operating and everything kept operating,
[01:17:11] kept going and it was still despite the significant impact there had been on the enemy. The enemy
[01:17:24] was still bringing it and they were starting to get a little bit more desperate and because we
[01:17:32] had really shut down a lot of their movements and they were starting to really try and strike back
[01:17:37] significantly when they could. So basically, almost every time that we went out into into a
[01:17:49] car, the other day, we were a model you was on at this point. So September 29th, 2006, you guys were doing another
[01:18:07] operation in support of the first the 506. Operation Kentucky jumper in the heart of the
[01:18:12] Lob district right by the stadium. We had inserted the other night before. Again, in an area,
[01:18:20] we had operated multiple times before. We knew it like the back of our hand. We had taken multiple
[01:18:26] positions in that area. And on this specific one, we had taken a very dominant building when I say
[01:18:31] dominant in terms of height of height. We had the height over any other building. And we were
[01:18:39] has diligent and with thotical as we were with any other mission. And shortly after sunrise,
[01:18:50] we were engaged with the enemy. First of the 506, I'd come into clear several sectors of
[01:18:55] the Lob district. And I think by noon, myself on to another SIL, sniper at the native foregast.
[01:19:03] And you two had sort of laid down and get some rest because we'd been up for close 24 hours.
[01:19:15] And Mike and I were holding the security. And Mike, you actually jumped on my sniper rifle
[01:19:21] to get some gun time. And there was a SIL to his left three feet. And that was three feet to his right.
[01:19:29] And of course, one of the things that's a young guy and I realized now is I just always pushed
[01:19:35] to the edge. And sometimes to take care of the guys, you have to take care of yourself. And I just didn't
[01:19:39] learn that early on. So what I've always tried to stay awake and I tried to sleep as a little
[01:19:43] as possible. Because I thought I had to be there. You know, case they needed me to make a decision
[01:19:48] in reality. They didn't need me there to make a decision. They had it. And I was very replaceable.
[01:19:53] But when your young, you don't always realize that. And so I was in and out of sleep, you know,
[01:19:59] bobbing, sitting on the ground, like he was sitting in a chair. And Mike and I were in
[01:20:05] conversation basically about going home. Because we knew that was one of the last missions.
[01:20:10] And Mike was excited because he was going to sniper school. I don't know if you remember that.
[01:20:14] You guys had to line that up. He'd been a machine gunner. Most of the, well, all the
[01:20:21] you to point at located right next to JP, who was the point man. And so that was Mike's job
[01:20:28] was to Overwatch, like snake Michael, Overwatch, JP. In case they ran into enemy contact,
[01:20:35] today would be the first ones. And Mike he would lay it down. And Mike he had laid it down
[01:20:39] on multiple multiple occasions before. And then the other thing we were talking about,
[01:20:45] uh, is he was dating a girl? And we were talking about that. He knew I was excited. Because my
[01:20:51] daughter at the time was two years old. And, you know, I don't think I had talked to my family much
[01:20:55] on that deployment because we were just so busy. And that sort of my style too is once I'm going
[01:21:00] to play, it was easier for me not to talk to my family because it was actually a distraction.
[01:21:05] Because it would, it would mess with my mind. So you knew the mission was to get home to your
[01:21:10] family as quickly as possible. And in the best way for me to do that, I'm not saying it was the right
[01:21:15] way. Um, was to focus on what I needed to do and it had a hundred percent of my attention.
[01:21:20] Because I would not, you know, for the life of me, I would not allow one of my guys to get killed.
[01:21:25] But unfortunately, that's out of our control. It's war. And war's not clean.
[01:21:31] But, uh, midday, um, you know, contacted died down. There was still movement out there.
[01:21:38] But, uh, during the conversation, um, a uh, a grenade had come over the roof.
[01:21:47] And, um, again, I was in and out of sleep, but what really sort of snapped me to heart was
[01:21:52] racer right away was Mikey snapped up. Remember, he was in a seat. The grenade had come over the
[01:21:58] roof and hit him in the chest and bounced on the ground right in front of him. And now there's
[01:22:03] there's a lot of accounts out there that are wrong. I saw some, uh, other seal speaking to a, uh,
[01:22:09] a crowd about this, you know, that there was a entrance to the rooftop that, you know, a stairwell
[01:22:15] that would go down in the main, uh, main building. And that wasn't true. We were actually like 15
[01:22:22] meters, uh, from that stairwell at the very edge of the roof, uh, closest to the street.
[01:22:29] When Mikey, I say Mikey had the greatest chance of getting their way,
[01:22:31] is that all he had to do was dive in the other direction. And he'd most likely take a little
[01:22:36] shot and I looked at the bottom of the feet into the calves, but he would have gone home.
[01:22:40] And, um, the thing that amazes me is, uh, uh, you know, I'm not the, uh, do list tool in the shed
[01:22:48] nor am I the sharpest, but the cognitive ability to assess what just had happened in the potential
[01:22:54] outcomes that if he chose self-preservation, which is not a wrong call, um, that the seal to
[01:23:03] his left and myself, what did just eight in the grenade in the face completely, just done.
[01:23:09] And the other seal to his left had kids as well. And, um, you know, you, you play this over
[01:23:18] your head and trust me, I play it every day and the first thing I think about when I wake up is
[01:23:23] Mikey and my kids and the last thing I think about when I go to sleep is Mikey and my kids.
[01:23:28] And the other reason I say that is there's a picture of, uh, of Mikey on my wall.
[01:23:33] And you know, it's that iconic picture of Mikey with Seth and another seal in the background
[01:23:37] with the yellow smoke and he's carrying the, uh, the machine gun. And, um,
[01:23:43] he yelled good-nid and then, um, he dove down on it. And, um, not to add humor to the situation,
[01:23:59] but it's almost like that scene from, uh, snatch where, you know, the guys are frozen as, uh,
[01:24:07] as the shotguns going off and they say you sit there with a stupid looking in the face.
[01:24:10] Uh, I probably sat there with a stupid look on my face because one, we, you know, we're in the heat
[01:24:15] midday, we've been up 24 hours, we're exhausted and, um, it just happened so fast and Mikey just
[01:24:23] took action in a matter of milliseconds. Maybe he assessed the situation. He knew the outcomes
[01:24:33] and he made the most selfless decision that anyone can ever make. There's no walking away from that.
[01:24:40] And I know there's, there's some people that have walked away from jumping on her grenade,
[01:24:44] but those are statistical anomalies. And, um, it went off and, um, by him smothering it,
[01:24:53] it funnelized the grenade blast to the sides towards, uh, the seal to his left to myself.
[01:25:00] And we almost had mirror wounds, like, through and throughs in, in both legs.
[01:25:05] And, you know, I've never been that close to an explosive. We, we, we, we work with explosives all
[01:25:13] all the time within the seal teams, but we are very, uh, diligent about mitigating risk in the
[01:25:18] parameters that you have to be so far from the, uh, the explosives, um, the thing actually picked me up
[01:25:25] and flipped me over. And, um, I just, I could feel the pain. You know, people talk about,
[01:25:33] uh, if you're shot or wounded, like you don't feel it, the adrenaline takes over that
[01:25:39] in the case, it was immediate hot metal burning inside my legs or through through wounds just bleeding.
[01:25:49] So at the time, I, I didn't know if I had legs. I couldn't even, uh, I didn't even want to look.
[01:25:54] So I put my head sort of forehand on the, uh, the dusty rooftop and just took that big, sort of bite
[01:26:01] to eat the pain and, um, uh, a third or a fourth seal was already moving towards our direction.
[01:26:09] Um, you've been infected by the blast as well. Didn't take any shrapnel, but I mean, it rattled
[01:26:15] all of us and, uh, looked at Mikey, who's had was turned towards me and I, you know, Mikey,
[01:26:21] Mikey, and it was just lifeless. And, um, so the, the next decision was,
[01:26:30] the next thing that happens, we start to get lit up by any enemy machine gunfire.
[01:26:36] All chaos, uh, it's breaking out. It's pure chaos, pure, uh, pure hell.
[01:26:41] The Iraqi soldiers on the roof with that's except for one who's close to us, but he was actually
[01:26:46] stricken and fair in the field position. They all ran off the roof and left us.
[01:26:50] So you've got one critically mortally wounded, two, someone out of the fight can't stand up
[01:26:57] and then the third is dealing with, uh, with Mikey. And so we were left pretty much, you could say
[01:27:03] left to die by the Iraqi soldiers. And so I immediately went to my, um, in better to, uh, to call
[01:27:11] for Seth who was in a mutually supporting Overwatch position about 500 meters away. And, um,
[01:27:18] the blast had knocked out my in better. And so I'm calling finally, you know, I pulled the
[01:27:22] and better out and it's just clear screen and I turned it back on reset it. But the better has to go
[01:27:28] through a, it loads the program and it takes, uh, a minute, let's say, tops. I didn't have a minute.
[01:27:35] And so still having looked in my legs, um, looking around, I see the Iraqi soldier, and remember
[01:27:41] his name is Mohanad, actually spoke English. And, uh, he's in the field position. I mean, he's just
[01:27:47] striking my fair. And so I get up to run over to him. And as I stand up to run, I just go right
[01:27:54] down. Literally on my face. The legs just wouldn't work. And, uh, again, sort of eat the pain,
[01:28:01] um, which glad to do, given what my he's going through right now and what he did, did for us.
[01:28:07] And I crawl over there and the Iraqi soldiers used motorolous. And Seth had Iraqis with him as well.
[01:28:15] And so, uh, I actually, uh, called out to Seth, Seth eventually got on that motorolah.
[01:28:21] Um, and then I said, hey, we're, we're, we're bad. Like he's down hard. We need you now.
[01:28:27] And they knew something was going on because of the fire's just, you know,
[01:28:32] hit our building. Um, but you, as a commander, you have to wait, you know, let, let the situation
[01:28:38] develop, find out, let your, let your, your assistant, the two commander call back and give you a sit rebel,
[01:28:43] what's going on. He's probably here on the radio trying to find out. Um, but I got back to him,
[01:28:48] probably within a minute after the whole grenade blast that had gone off. In Seth said, hold on,
[01:28:54] we're coming. And, um, so I crawl back to where Mikey's at, the, the four seals drag him away from the wall.
[01:29:02] Um, and then, um, he's trying to work on it. And I told like, I'm like,
[01:29:08] get on the machine gun. Because remember Mikey carries the machine gun. It was right there.
[01:29:11] And he starts to lay down return fire. And, um, it seemed like ages before Seth got there.
[01:29:20] But finally, some of my like soldiers had come out and they're starting to return fire. But, you know,
[01:29:24] it probably only took Seth five minutes. But you gotta remember Seth and all those guys were set up
[01:29:29] within their position. They weren't ready to move. Um, so they had to leave a lot of stuff behind.
[01:29:33] And they, you know, sometimes you're not wearing your, your kit because it's so hot. You're there for,
[01:29:38] it was what, a 48 hour operation. You just, you're not always wearing your kit. So they have to throw
[01:29:42] on their kit probably and get to us. And then when they move into the street, what happens?
[01:29:47] The animation is not there under fire. And, um, you know, um, we didn't have our morphing kits.
[01:29:57] And this was a problem with sort of the process of how that work. If you remember, we had sent home
[01:30:01] the guy who was signed form about a week earlier. And so I remember, uh, I finally had the
[01:30:06] courage to look at my legs. And I didn't expect to see anything there. And there was two two legs,
[01:30:12] very bloody, uh, ACU pants. But they were there and have a sort of a, uh, a relief and a sense.
[01:30:19] Okay, my legs are there. They're just not working right now. And I went to a grab from my morphing
[01:30:23] and it was gone. And so the other ceiling I or, you know, were a pain. But, okay, no more
[01:30:29] relief moving on. Um, so I eventually get there. And, uh, they start working on Mikey. They didn't
[01:30:36] know the building where they were in, uh, and apparently, again, God, I love the, I think you actually
[01:30:42] activated the, uh, the Bradley's and medicine on the backside of the building. They're completely
[01:30:46] different street. I don't know. Again, there was, there was some confusion about where to go. And
[01:30:50] I did my best to clear that up from what I remember, which I don't remember very well. Well,
[01:30:59] the, to the guy from Cess, uh, Elmett grabbed me and I led them through the, the stairwell
[01:31:04] down. There was an adjacent door to building behind them in the backyard. So we went through that building
[01:31:12] to the road that was on the other side. It parallel road from the, the road we were operating on.
[01:31:16] It was a, it was a main road. And, um, they throw the other wooded seal myself in there. And then
[01:31:24] the guy who was carrying Mikey, uh, brings Mikey into the, uh, the Bradley funding vehicle. And,
[01:31:32] we take off. And that guy, the look on its face, was pure exhaustion. Now, within the military, we always,
[01:31:39] you know, we, we trained in the buddy carry and we do it as part of like physical training.
[01:31:43] But you're also rigid when you're carrying your buddy. And he's got his hand in your back.
[01:31:49] And Mikey was not a small boy, you know, easily probably two ten. He's about six two six three.
[01:31:56] And this guy, uh, who carried him was, I mean, he's a physical stun. And he was exhausted.
[01:32:03] And we talked about it years later, because he sort of put Mikey down in the Bradley vehicle.
[01:32:08] And he sat down just sort of was exhausted and sat there and I yelled it on my camera. What are you doing?
[01:32:13] You know, start CPR and he sort of snapped to and start CPR. You know, he actually gave me years late.
[01:32:20] He's like, man, I'm really sorry about that. I'm like, brother, you don't have to apologize.
[01:32:25] You would just carry him, you know, probably a hundred meters with combat equipment on.
[01:32:30] And you just, you know, you weren't with, you took a second to recover. That, it's not your fault.
[01:32:36] But everyone finds fault in that day and everyone feels bad. JP who should have been there.
[01:32:41] But it cut his finger if you remember. Yeah.
[01:32:44] Wasn't there. And um, yeah, it was, you know, you talk about the relationship in the 506.
[01:32:52] Again, it seemed like ages from the Bradley to get from our position in central Romani, Milab,
[01:32:58] to the Cricket or Aid station. And I do remember when I got there, the medic gave me a little shot of Morphine.
[01:33:08] And like three minutes go by and talk about losing your exposure. I'm like, hey, man, I'm freaking pain.
[01:33:16] And I regret saying this. It was just like stupid things you say when things are going wrong.
[01:33:21] And I grabbed him by the car. I'm like, I'm a Navy seal. You've got to rip that shit up.
[01:33:27] And you know, I could tell the look of sort of frustration is I comes back and sticks me in finally,
[01:33:33] like the Morphine hits and the pain subsided. But what I remember vividly is one, they had very
[01:33:41] little capability for surgery. In fact, no, they're all and they had a prep us in, uh,
[01:33:46] 240, uh, 46 is running round to get us and who shows up. Dave will make.
[01:33:51] Colonel McFarland. I'm sorry, Colonel Lowarong Clark and the senior leadership from the first of the Vivo 6.
[01:33:59] In fact, there was probably a hundred soldiers out there. And so they bring us out in the stretchers.
[01:34:04] We're, we're strapped down and Dave will mac has some oak leaves because I remember it's still midday.
[01:34:11] And he puts them on me laying on the stretcher and I flew off with those oak leaves. And if you know the
[01:34:17] army, they don't get good gear, especially in the infantry. That guy just gave me his like a high
[01:34:22] protection that I flew off with, but they saw us off. And they said, I know I am end up in, uh,
[01:34:29] Allen, out to Kedom. Uh, TQ. TQ. Yeah. Uh, for surgery. And again, who's waiting for me, um,
[01:34:37] Rob, you're counting part and, uh, all the boys. And so the, uh, you know, before they rush in the
[01:34:45] surgery and put us under, um, Rob was there, but they, they thought, and in retrospect, you know,
[01:34:53] I still struggle with this, because I was almost upset with it at the time. It was almost like
[01:34:58] rubbing a dog's face and, and it's own faces for taking a crap on the carpet is they thought
[01:35:04] we would want to see Mikey. And, um, so they laid both of us right by Mikey, uh, who was
[01:35:11] declared deceased by this point. It was just almost like a point of shame, a point of utter shame.
[01:35:17] And, uh, I just getting to look, you know, the other seals and tears I'm in tears, but I just,
[01:35:21] I just couldn't look. And, uh, I know they, they had nothing but the best intent. But at the time,
[01:35:28] it was just, it was like, I don't want to see this. I know what I did. I know what happened. Um,
[01:35:35] so they did that. They give us about five minutes and then, uh, rustists in the surgery and, uh,
[01:35:42] you know, next thing I know I wake up in, uh, Baghdad and, uh, go through another procedure and then
[01:35:50] prep to get the metavac to Germany, to, to go through another procedure and, um, the great thing is,
[01:35:59] you know, got other sealants I were together in the entire time that gave us two, uh, seals to
[01:36:05] escort us and, um, you know, Germany, we're there for I think three days and just people kept
[01:36:12] this and then visiting it. And at the time it's just I didn't want to talk to anyone. I did want to
[01:36:16] talk to you and Seth. And, and that's what I talked to you for the first time was when you got to Germany.
[01:36:23] And, um, it's because I had, I had my sit rep to pass and, and I don't know how, I'm sure,
[01:36:31] because the other seal, the fore seal on that rooftop state was Seth. He, Seth wasn't where of what
[01:36:36] it happened. But I need to talk to you guys to be like, hey, he jumped on that thing and in the
[01:36:42] military when somebody jumps on a grenade grenade, you know what that means. It is the most
[01:36:47] selfless act of valor that there is and, um, it needs to be reported because usually if the medical
[01:36:56] records check out the, the due diligence has done and it shows that it is truth. It is a metal
[01:37:01] of water. And, um, I think that's where I started this citation to, to get to you. Um, and then, um,
[01:37:12] yeah, after the three days there, uh, we, uh, we're in the back and sitting here. Just FYI, the only thing
[01:37:19] you told me, which I asked you, I was trying to ask you questions about hey, man, or you're okay.
[01:37:25] How's the other seal that's wounded? And you just, we're like, that's all you're telling me. It was
[01:37:29] about Mikey. It's all you're telling me. More fun is a hell of a drug. No, man, it's because you,
[01:37:36] you wanted to make sure I knew what was going on. You wanted to make sure that, what happened?
[01:37:40] You wanted to make sure that I knew that you, you didn't care about anything else.
[01:37:44] That you were just like, this is what he did. This is what he did. I'm telling you, this is what
[01:37:48] he did. I'm like, I know, man, I got it. I'm like, are you okay? He's like, you're like, don't care.
[01:37:53] This is what he did. He saved me. He saved this guy. He saved all three of us up there.
[01:38:00] That was the only thing you cared about. And so, then you got home and uh,
[01:38:14] and yeah, I remember, you know, people asked me about like, you know, the, the few rules of my
[01:38:31] guys, but I wasn't never there. Because I was, you know, we were still deployed, but I know that
[01:38:36] this point you were. Um, and I know that's uh, okay, even imagine for you what that process was like,
[01:38:52] it was shame. The, the, the way Mikey passed, it's one of the most intimate ways,
[01:39:01] like, brothers can pass with one another. It's, you know, we're, we're out there in the
[01:39:09] conduct of the fight. Uh, I get shot laying down fire. It's selfless, but when somebody makes a
[01:39:16] sacrifice, but jump in over to Nade, that, that is, that is a message of hey. This is my gift to you.
[01:39:23] Keep my memory alive and live well. But to the guy that is saved, you all you feel is shame.
[01:39:30] And I, and I know you, you felt these same sort of feelings is, you know, ultimately responsible for these
[01:39:36] guys. Um, and I think we all conducted our career with God help me if there isn't anything I could
[01:39:43] have done in the planning and risk mitigation and preparation for this mission or during the conduct of
[01:39:51] the mission that brings my guys home, then I am wrong, and that is on me. And so to come home, even though
[01:39:59] everyone was, was so welcoming and gracious and, and, and, and caring, it's just you feel this,
[01:40:06] this, like, just blanket of shame. And, and funny enough, um, when, uh, they had these buses waiting
[01:40:15] for us at, uh, some Sandy, or their part, because remember, it was, it was a, some private jet that
[01:40:20] took us from Bethesda to, to Sandy Aigo, and so they loaded us up on a bus and then straight to
[01:40:25] Balbo and, um, my ex wife and my daughter were waiting there and, um, get my daughters to at the time,
[01:40:33] but she would not come to me. Maybe they had a little sign, welcome home, Daddy, and, you know,
[01:40:38] my ex wife tried, kept trying to make, because I'm still on a stretcher, uh, tried, try to keep
[01:40:43] give my daughter to me and she just would, she was cleaning on to my ex, would not come to me.
[01:40:47] And it was just, even that, like I remember that's so vividly, and I think, in a, in a, in a
[01:40:52] subtle way, like I held that against my daughter for, for a short while, um,
[01:40:58] it's like it was just like, it was almost like a shunning, like she knew what happened.
[01:41:03] She was like shunning me, uh, bottom line, she was scared. Yeah, bottom line, she's a two-year-old.
[01:41:09] Yeah, that was, in the second month, and then she's going, like, I'm used to being with mom,
[01:41:14] but, uh, just, just being at the funeral and everything and just looking at all, you know,
[01:41:19] watching all the seals there, they took, you know, uh, to celebrate my ex life, it, it just,
[01:41:25] it felt like the eyes were on me, too. And that's, that's a selfish feeling,
[01:41:28] hate, this isn't about you, whatsoever, but it was just this, like, how could, how could I
[01:41:33] like that happen and why didn't you jump on the grenade? Like, how could you not get there in
[01:41:37] time, or you slow? Could you not assess what are you stupid? And, um, I still don't have a good answer
[01:41:43] for that, you know, um, but what really just, you know, we talked about this, it's like,
[01:41:50] somebody needs to hold me accountable. That's what I found. I'm like, somebody needs to hold
[01:41:55] me accountable. And, uh, you know, the boys picking me up for the funeral, and of course,
[01:42:00] me and the other guy, pack up the wheelchair, throw them in the back of the suburban, and,
[01:42:05] uh, when we get to the, um, the mass prior to the, uh, the funeral, uh, Miss Montsour
[01:42:12] is waiting, and Neil, I'm ready to, uh, to own what had happened, and before, you know,
[01:42:20] I can even get the words out. She wraps her arms around the other seal and I, and says,
[01:42:25] I'm so happy, you are home. Thank you for being with my son. And at that point, like,
[01:42:33] okay, I have no idea what to say. You just totally threw me off my game. Like, you should be
[01:42:41] upset. You just lost your son, and you are thanking me for being with your son, and you're
[01:42:48] telling me, you are so happy that I'm home. I'm talking about, like, infilling the ultimate mind,
[01:42:56] fine kid. But that is just a testament of the family that Mikey came from. And for the audience,
[01:43:03] Mikey was a Southern California kid. Again, pretty big kid. That's 62. Probably about
[01:43:09] two, 10, Ryzen's a humor and was a devout Catholic. And the family still won't. I don't want
[01:43:16] you to think of this like, straight religious family. They are from the family family, but they
[01:43:21] dare resolute, never leaves. And then from Southern California, and um, they're the most
[01:43:27] selfless family I've ever met. And when you meet them and you spend time with them, you quickly
[01:43:32] realize where Mikey got it. And he went to every mass at Corrigaturn. When I say mass, it's in a
[01:43:38] bombed out building with some military priest, and about five people, one of which is Mikey
[01:43:45] passing out communion. And he had faith. And getting to know the family was actually very easy after
[01:43:55] that. But with time, as time went on, you know, you'd be in the field like you're a reminder
[01:44:01] of their son and not the best light. And so I think over time, I pulled away from the family
[01:44:09] to give them their rest because at some point they have to put it down and move on with their lives.
[01:44:14] And I don't know if that's a right call in. I still struggle with that today. But I mean, I love
[01:44:19] the family. Even there was a sense of guilt from my parents when they met their parents just how
[01:44:25] good of people they are. And you feel like why they're a son and not ours. Or my parents are
[01:44:31] thankful. Don't get me wrong. They're extremely grateful. But there was a sense of guilt throughout
[01:44:35] our entire family that we get to move on in their family lives with this burden. Much like we do
[01:44:42] for the rest of their lives. Well, I can tell you that when you said it's a reminder, not in a good
[01:44:51] way, I would actually dispute that with you. And I promise you that it's a, it's a, they love
[01:44:58] hearing from you and talking to you and anyone, same with Mark, same with Ryan, same with, same
[01:45:03] with all of our friends at the fall. And if you can go and tell a story that they haven't heard
[01:45:08] before or tell a story that they've heard a hundred times before, it's, it's, it's worth it.
[01:45:15] At what point did you realize that you were going to heal quick enough to go back
[01:45:20] in two and other. But actually they told me to take a technique and they wanted to
[01:45:26] give me orders out of team three and to take a easy tour and relax, which is the strangest thing
[01:45:36] I would ever think to hear from a bunch of seals, seal iters. It was actually okay, I mean,
[01:45:42] you're going to be back in the game, it's quickly as possible because that's what's best for you.
[01:45:47] So, talking about the fact that you're not sending me away from a sealed team three, so what do they do
[01:45:50] and responses that they align me into another buttoon that is heading to pick up for listeners,
[01:45:59] pick on means specific man that means we're going over the Philippines to work with the, the
[01:46:03] the Philippines seals and you will not be in combat. You are doing host nation building
[01:46:11] and funny enough when they align the buttoons, there's these little placards with your face
[01:46:16] and your name and the master chiefs. It's a big magnet. We call it the Ouija board
[01:46:24] because that's how they stack up who's going where and so the master chiefs office, this is a
[01:46:30] no kidding story, was open and they've got the three task units with each of the buttoons underneath
[01:46:36] them, the two buttoons and all the pictures of who's in one buttoon and I'm in this buttoon going to pick
[01:46:42] them. So what I do is take my magnet, take some junior officer that's an AOC in a
[01:46:50] cent comp buttoon going back to Iraq, put my picture there, put his picture in the pick-on buttoon
[01:46:57] literally go up to the toons base and get won so the guys name say hey so and so you've just been
[01:47:03] a re-signed to this buttoon go report and I'm not kidding you've done is how that happened and
[01:47:08] you know whenever something either one they didn't recognize that it happened or two they're just like
[01:47:14] okay we're not talking about this one and I screwed over a kid by sending him to pick on first
[01:47:20] but first buttoon I don't feel all that bad about it. So you knew how I'm thinking to heal up
[01:47:28] so it was about a four months of debris meant so you know when you had some holes that were as deep
[01:47:34] as half a golf ball and if you don't pick the scab off then it'll heal in a concave manner so this
[01:47:42] little doctor female doctor had to go in every day and she would pick at the scab to keep the
[01:47:47] wound fresh so that it heals out called her doctor pain but did that for about four months
[01:47:52] then I had to get the legs working and actually start to walk and then run but overall four months
[01:47:58] because remember when when a team comes back from a deployment to go into a six month
[01:48:02] individual training cycle so guys can go to sniper school and so I had time to heal but
[01:48:08] there's still a lot of strap metal in my legs we formed up with the batoon I'd put on some bad
[01:48:16] weight and then you know throughout that entire two two year training cycle in fact again named
[01:48:24] Derek Benson and we both know and Derek was killed on extortion 17 would cut into my legs
[01:48:32] the the strap metal that was pushing towards the skin he would remove it so I had a little jar of
[01:48:36] of strap metal throughout that two year period that he would you would take out and he loved it you love the medicine side
[01:48:42] so and then you roll back back to Iraq yeah do you remember anything in work up any
[01:48:52] spectacular you're giving me that look both people that I put through work up give me that look
[01:48:58] so hey having more than for jocco you know as we're gonna be on me naturally I put it on myself
[01:49:06] one of those self-inflicted pressures that he's gonna expect me to to perform at a higher level
[01:49:12] given the amount of combat experience I had had and you had by that point drastically changed
[01:49:18] how the West Coast seal team's prepared for war and it was you know it was good pressure I like
[01:49:26] pressure I like when somebody holds me accountable and you know I think echo and I were talking
[01:49:31] about this you have a very ungany way of having a conversation without saying a word
[01:49:36] you sort of you know the eyebrows come down lower and you just stare and one of the said is like
[01:49:43] you would you would do that and look at me during the training be like hey here's the standard for
[01:49:48] everyone else here's your standard get it done good talk and so you there were probably run
[01:49:55] eyebrows harder on myself than you were but I do remember not military operations are specifically
[01:50:04] in Kentucky and that was some of the best training we we got through and again that was drastically
[01:50:11] different than the prior work up prior to our body and for the guys that had not seen combat
[01:50:18] given what happened on the next deployment that that absolutely prepared us for what happened
[01:50:25] yeah I mean coming back I was so ideal for me to go back and run training I mean if there's no
[01:50:31] better job I could and that's you know I was a little really lucky that a good relationship with
[01:50:35] the admiral and he said like where do you want to go and I said I want to go run trade-out because I
[01:50:39] need to get these guys ready because when we got back Ramadi wasn't done yet it ended up finishing
[01:50:45] up pretty quickly thereafter but I was just thinking hey everyone's gonna be going back and doing the
[01:50:48] same thing for another the average counter in surgeons he lasts seven years this started six months
[01:50:52] ago we got like many years worth of fighting and these guys need to be ready for that specific thing
[01:50:58] that I know how to do and so I need to go run that training and that's what I did and I was definitely
[01:51:05] it's funny because like when you're talking about like like I there's a lot of buddy carrying
[01:51:10] going on when I was running training and the reason is because I got the debrief you know like
[01:51:16] it's I knew it's like this is gonna be if you get in the situation it's not it's not what you think
[01:51:21] it is it's gonna be hell and how do you prepare for it you prepare for it you do is close you make this
[01:51:27] is close to combat as you can possibly make it then that was my goal and it was freaking hard training
[01:51:32] and I you know I had so many guys come back over the years after that when I was running training that
[01:51:38] we're like hey you know I just got back from Afghanistan thank you and the fire fights were literally
[01:51:45] easier than going through a block of land warfare they would be so stoked and it was awesome that's
[01:51:50] like the best compliments I've ever gotten in my life was having those guys come back and and also I was
[01:51:54] just talking to as a matter of fact I was talking to the guy that told me that you were good to go the
[01:51:59] other day and he's he's like oh we would have had so many blue on blues if we didn't go through that
[01:52:03] work up we were so much better we were so prepared and they had a better freaking hardcore
[01:52:07] deployment to Afghanistan and they kicked ass and he's like yeah we were totally good to go because
[01:52:12] that training set us up and so that was that was a real honor for me to be able to get to do that
[01:52:18] but yeah I was a little bit I was also a little bit still like I remember I remember and I've
[01:52:25] talked about this before in the podcast but like I'd be in Mount like it watching urban training
[01:52:29] going on and I'd see like a new guy or something like standing in the middle of the street and I would
[01:52:32] literally feel like a sickness in my stomach like a pit like just like when I was in the
[01:52:37] body if you'd see someone in the street you'd like to get out of the street I would have that feeling
[01:52:41] and so when I'd go over and talk to him it would you generally be like like pretty hostile like
[01:52:46] bro what the hell are you doing you're in the middle of the street get out of here you're going to
[01:52:50] get freaking killed and so yeah it was good and it was good that we put you guys through that because
[01:52:57] you guys went right back into the fire right back into the fire on on that next deployment
[01:53:03] and you don't lean into that for the last month I had my son who I named after Mikey so his name
[01:53:11] is Michael Anthony Surreli it was Michael Anthony the Montsorn he knows he's not named after me
[01:53:18] so I get to see him born less than two weeks after that we all end up in DC to see Mikey
[01:53:25] posh him nicely recognize with the metal of honor and then from Washington DC I fly directly to
[01:53:34] the middle east and then into Iraq I mean it literally butted up when we were deploying again and
[01:53:41] so we end up back in Alambar province I rack I end up specifically in Ramadi which is completely different
[01:53:50] completely pacified and part of you just can't even believe it you're just like no no it's
[01:53:56] wait just wait it's coming they're gonna attack and notes not that way what at the same time
[01:54:02] we were arriving in Iraq the solder militia back by Iran Iranian special groups there what we call
[01:54:07] the cuts forces there their special forces had kicked off a major spring offensive in the spring of
[01:54:13] 2008 and so the army is getting hammered inside of solder city soldiers are dying and they
[01:54:22] request sniper support from the US special operations command specifically siege a sort of AP and that
[01:54:33] siege a sort of knowing that sealed team three had run that similar mission in support of the one one
[01:54:40] ready combat brigade the deployment prior said hey can you guys run this mission so are commander at
[01:54:48] the time in master c4 faced with a decision we had commitments in Alambar province you just couldn't
[01:54:53] shut down a location and send that entire unit to solder city that that wasn't going to work
[01:55:01] so he had to make a decision of taking seals from all the particular outstations in Alambar
[01:55:06] thrown them into sort of this haj pod unit so you had seals from two different seals
[01:55:12] thrown together and we loaded up a bunch of rg's i think eight eight and all and 40 of us
[01:55:19] drove out to the Baghdad International Airport and set up a new unit called debt defender
[01:55:27] detachment naval special warfare detachment Baghdad and we named it defender
[01:55:34] St. Michael dark angel defender after Mikey and we created this badass patch that had the
[01:55:40] arc angel on there and we all knew and some of Mikey's boys that had gone through bugs
[01:55:47] were in this new unit good good friends of mine that were in Iraq at that time they had deployed
[01:55:53] to the buildings and so we are located in Baghdad but solder city is like an hour and 15 minutes away
[01:56:01] from Baghdad International Airport and so you know they're screaming for us to get in and again this
[01:56:07] unit has never worked together some of them have like these three guys came from this
[01:56:10] but they had worked together but they had worked with these guys in the seal teams and the both
[01:56:15] the convention and seizure sort of for a scream for us again and there and so we did the best
[01:56:20] we could rehearsals the planning we had never operated in the area maybe some people had but
[01:56:25] those were the very senior seals and we yet thrust into solder city primarily around this
[01:56:33] this route called route gold and they were trying to at that point the strategy was to
[01:56:39] cordun off or in close solder city with these large t-barriers so that we can control the entry points
[01:56:45] into the city and hence cut off supplies or enemy troops coming into the city and ultimately
[01:56:54] the strategy worked but the first night in all 40 of us go in and again remember we had this like
[01:57:00] young Intel officer who had just come from first time in Iraq had come from Alianbar where you're dealing
[01:57:07] with now the remnants of a of a SUNY enemy and we're now operating in Shia territory and in
[01:57:15] Shia enemy completely two different styles of fighting two different purposes one will
[01:57:23] get their G-haed on to the point where the die others are not necessarily going to give it a life so
[01:57:27] they're in fighting and pull back and then find another day and he didn't understand really the
[01:57:31] difference and so the Intel wasn't exactly aligning again we hadn't been in the lot the area we
[01:57:36] go in the first night and all hell breaks loose remember Chris cows with us these are lead sniper
[01:57:42] and we're trying to get into a position and I mean we had EFP's detonated on our patrol
[01:57:50] for listeners and EFP is an explosive forming projectile again if you remember these were
[01:57:57] Ironian made and what it is is a concave plate of copper with a lot of explosives behind it
[01:58:03] when you detonate it it turns it into a molten projectile molten because I am bullet yes and this thing
[01:58:12] could cut through Bradley and RG and Abrams take cut right through like a hot knife through
[01:58:19] uh that better these things were nasty and they were killing troops we had that detonated on us
[01:58:23] and then they owned the rooftops and they had what we were trying to do to them and so we are just
[01:58:32] like fish and the fish bowl and they are shooting Chris took one round in the helmet
[01:58:36] bounced off and you know Seth had now taken your position as the and it really is the
[01:58:45] band got back together task unit bruiser and so Seth is back with the striker company that
[01:58:52] in certain us doing his job and deflection and making sure we had the sport we needed
[01:58:56] and shortly after we called for hot extract I mean guys we're getting low on ammo
[01:59:03] the enemies maneuvering RPGs pk and fire on the rooftops down into us how we did not lose a guy
[01:59:10] I will never know and what I like to say is that Mark Ryan and Mikey were looking after us
[01:59:16] they got this one we're gonna give this one to reset but we called Seth in and the whole
[01:59:22] I do remember this about Seth is as the strikers come in strikers are it's like an armored version
[01:59:28] of a humvee with wheels that can carry more troops than a humvee larger and they have some pretty
[01:59:37] good armament and weapon systems and the ramp lowers and Seth runs off and starts firing into
[01:59:46] a building and of course it's that's how he's like let's go get on the strikers and the guy
[01:59:53] start loading up and the strikers are getting after it to the point where they went winch
[01:59:58] after getting his out of there and one of the striker operators says hey give me your gun
[02:00:02] and I hand him my SR25 and he just starts going at it my hand him my last maggy reloads and he's
[02:00:08] just getting to after it well tell you what humbling experience put us back into the same position
[02:00:14] like a new guy in the body okay hey we've got some great experience we got a reset and we we said hey
[02:00:20] give us like 36 hours we need you to do some serious planning we needed to do some serious rehearsals
[02:00:25] we did that and then we inserted shortly after that you know the funny thing is the only time
[02:00:30] like I really felt vulnerable and I remember I called my brother before we inserted the next
[02:00:39] time and I said hey I don't think things are going to work out here but my kids know I love
[02:00:46] and make sure you know my daughter grows up to be a person and character and make sure my
[02:00:51] grandma and my son grows up to be a man and me and my brother don't talk all that much but for me
[02:00:56] to make that call was probably a bad choice and for him to hear that probably put a lot more
[02:01:01] concern on his plate but we inserted and we got into position and the guy started knocking
[02:01:08] out of the park and then mission after mission they just kept eliminating combatants
[02:01:14] cigarettes started to dive we had 172 hour operation where the guys eliminated 50 fighters
[02:01:20] and within three weeks I think I want to limited I don't want to I'd probably hear
[02:01:27] plus up numbers I think it was like 125 to 150 within three weeks the guys eliminated
[02:01:31] and cigarettes went to almost zero and then there was not much to do for the rest of the
[02:01:38] plan well all the next sign up and activities that's enemy attacks basically but what's also
[02:01:43] interesting is that at the tail end of that the shakes inside solder city came out and said hey
[02:01:48] look we're good like we're here to make friends now we're done with this and what was really
[02:01:52] awesome was it solder city had been a complete nightmare for five straight years I mean solder city
[02:01:58] was completely uncontrollable and then in a six week period give or take that the those operations
[02:02:06] took place it was like done it was like they the the shakes came out and said yep we'll we'll keep
[02:02:11] this under control we want to make peace and and that's what happened that was and that was a
[02:02:16] they that was an unbelievable set of circumstances did you know the one thing I'd had to
[02:02:21] put on that remember and and you know it's your dad earned sets trust because of the distance
[02:02:28] between the bagged out internationally airport in solder city the conventional unit that was
[02:02:33] supporting us when we go into solder was in outside of solder city so he's like hey Mike
[02:02:38] and I think I spent all three weeks there he's like hey stay there plan the missions
[02:02:43] uh if you need to do a wrecking of the site go out with the conventional and so for three weeks
[02:02:47] like I wasn't with the boys they would move to me and then we would execute the mission but you know
[02:02:52] learning what we had about unity that for and putting your your aside in building
[02:02:58] personal capital through relationships we built a great relationship with the the 10th mountain
[02:03:04] and they gave us anything we needed and there's a lot of lessons learned from our body that we you know
[02:03:08] we took in that we actually stepped up in terms of the mission planning and preparation with some of the assets
[02:03:12] that the tenth mountain ahead but I was going out with the conventional spun myself
[02:03:17] if I needed to get to another outstation or a cop they would have a con boy of Bradley's waiting for me
[02:03:22] just for me and I loved it but Seth realized I was probably getting a little off the reservation
[02:03:27] at one point we conducted a mission we got back to that larger base and he said hey go get your
[02:03:33] stuff going back and I'm like I actually think I'm part of the little of them and he's like go get your
[02:03:37] stuff going back that was pissed because I was loving I was criminal curts in it yeah loving it
[02:03:44] you know he made the right call so yeah I know you guys didn't outstanding job there and again
[02:03:50] it wasn't obviously wasn't just you guys the tenth mountain did freaking unbelievable job
[02:03:54] the some of the images that were coming back at that time of those guys putting that tea barrier
[02:03:58] up right in the middle or right at the what side of the solder city was at the eastern side of
[02:04:02] solder city then you could see those guys out there putting that barrier putting those barriers up
[02:04:07] the conventional army guys it was freaking awesome and what what what awesome guys
[02:04:13] then you come back from that deployment you think you maybe you had enough yet not really
[02:04:22] you know on that in that vein I sat down with that commanding officer of team through at the time
[02:04:28] and you know I got in order to an east coast team and you know he was doing my final fit
[02:04:34] rap and he said to me often we'd pretty good relationship and he said the last thing I want to
[02:04:39] leave you with is at some point it becomes about family and I'm looking at him and I pause for about
[02:04:45] ten seconds I said Roger that sir but within the hamster wheel turning in my head was are you freaking
[02:04:53] kidding me I'm gonna deploy as much and as often as I can because this thing is not gonna last
[02:05:01] forever and I'm gonna to another command with with a bunch of warriors and I know I want to get
[02:05:06] right and stride and deploy as much as possible but in retrospect towards the end I realized what
[02:05:11] he was trying to tell me at some point you got to pull back so it only took you another what seven
[02:05:17] years to figure that out so you get out to the east coast and now you're doing just more to
[02:05:23] deployments yeah first one was to to Afghanistan with a great group of guys men you know I loved
[02:05:32] love these guys different feel to them but my first mission out was probably one of the toughest
[02:05:39] missions I'd ever been on in terms of just like terrain because we were in Kona our province now
[02:05:44] and how I would describe Kona our province is manned down take you know some of the worst areas
[02:05:50] of of the Colorado Rockies and then maybe multiply it by two and the enemy I mean they were this
[02:05:56] was their territory they had prepared positions it was a dangerous area and to put it into perspective
[02:06:02] a little more for for the listeners you know of all the metals of honor with in Afghanistan I think
[02:06:09] the majority of them were in that Kona ournor stand area to include Dakota miners
[02:06:16] and on the first mission yeah it just was like an eight hour hour
[02:06:25] so fast and actually so Adam Brown was was killed on that operation and that was my
[02:06:33] sort of baptism to fire to that new unit and I remember I looked at a good friend
[02:06:40] that Jonas was killed on the instructions 17 is a bro our all the missions like that
[02:06:47] he was like no that was that was one of our been on that I'm like okay I just want to make
[02:06:53] sure I need to get my head right if we'll say it again yeah like oh no what did I get myself into
[02:06:59] but it was good to to work with that team and get that experience and then I got a lot of
[02:07:05] time with the maritime side as well the boats but did in all with him what was that
[02:07:15] seven more deployments with great guys and you know lots and more brothers
[02:07:22] namely extortion 17 which was the largest loss of life in Afghanistan just you know it
[02:07:29] it's a travesty when we lose one soldier marine sailor in airman but when you lose 31
[02:07:38] that is just you know that that hits the military to to to the listeners they may say well 31
[02:07:45] soldiers you know you guys can easily recover from that you can't
[02:07:49] all the the man hours that go into to training those guys the level of proficiency they had
[02:07:55] crude over years like that is like that is a catastrophic failure or you know detriment to the
[02:08:03] military that is a loss of a lot of capability I yet alone the pain for those 31 families
[02:08:13] the children the or not the orphans but the kids that are left behind the wives that are left
[02:08:17] behind and and that will never have any solace other than that their level ones were
[02:08:23] doing what they believed in for them defending them but overall I mean great seven years
[02:08:32] and just nothing but lessons learned and leadership lessons in terms of being a troop commander
[02:08:39] and quite frankly you know my last experience I learned a lot which was not my best
[02:08:45] uh leadership experience you know you look at extreme ownership and there's ways I could
[02:08:54] handle certain situations better and I think I reflect a mine entire military career just on
[02:09:00] man I could have done that better that's what we all do is you know back and think man we could have
[02:09:04] done that better it goes back to what I was saying earlier about like if you know the way
[02:09:09] then the way appears everywhere but when you don't know it you're seeing like little like I even
[02:09:15] I remember when I was young man young and I do something that was like partially right but then I
[02:09:20] do something that wasn't and I think of myself and if I would have known if I would have gotten some
[02:09:25] reinforcement if I would have figured it out better you know like figured it out better and you just
[02:09:30] don't and that's one of the hardest things about one of our hardest things about it's not just
[02:09:34] the civil teams it's the military when you complete a job you don't get to do it anymore
[02:09:38] uh you you get done with your assistant platoon commander and you're like okay I got this figured out
[02:09:43] I'm ready to do it again they're like no now you're gonna be a platoon commander and then you get
[02:09:46] done with your platoon commander you go okay I got this figured out I'm ready to do it again they
[02:09:49] go no you're gonna be a task to become better then as soon as you get you figure something out
[02:09:52] you're done with that job and you can't go back and you're very seldom do you get to go back
[02:09:56] and do you get it so we all sit around and look back and and there's another weird thing about this
[02:10:02] whole deal this whole deal is that it's so hard to someone's got to have a real open mind
[02:10:13] to be able to teach it to people you know someone's got to be when someone's got to have an open
[02:10:19] mind like I would say when I was running trade at I would say like 30 or 40% of the people
[02:10:28] would be like listening and absorbing and which is important which is pretty good it's actually
[02:10:33] pretty good but there was like 30% of the people that you know I would try and explain something to
[02:10:39] him and it just wouldn't they just wouldn't like you're putting the way in front of them but
[02:10:43] what they don't recognize it they can't see it and so it's easy now that you know the way
[02:10:49] when you look back at your own experiences you go the way appears everywhere but you didn't see it
[02:10:54] back I didn't see it back then I've just looked at it going and why did I want to figure that out
[02:11:00] it's one of those things and I think that's one of the things that that makes what I'm doing
[02:11:06] now what you're doing what we're doing now as a team is to be able to to try and pass these lessons on
[02:11:13] to leaders everywhere and you know leaders in the military leaders and police leaders and fire
[02:11:18] leader in business act everyone to be able to say look hey this is it over here I know this is hard
[02:11:24] to see but look at this and it's awesome to be doing what we're doing now and say oh and have people
[02:11:30] again a certain percentage of people that go I got it I got it I can take that and what's interesting
[02:11:36] about our business now is when people are raising their hand and they're asking for it that means
[02:11:41] their mind is open to they're open to it they want it whereas with and this does happen occasionally
[02:11:48] when we work with companies that we're getting imposed on you know like the board of directors
[02:11:52] and they go fix this company this company screwed up you got to go fix them those people don't
[02:11:56] have open months so they're they're looking when you're talking to them they're looking for reasons
[02:12:00] that what you're saying is wrong that's their goal is to say that doesn't apply to me it doesn't
[02:12:04] apply to this market doesn't it's no we actually work with eight companies in your exact
[02:12:09] industry your competitors and they have the same problem this is how they fix it but no this
[02:12:13] different for us okay it's different for you it's different for you leadership is different in your
[02:12:17] specific company leadership is different than it is everywhere else no that's actually not true
[02:12:24] not true at all so it's an unfortunate you know it's I've been thinking about this too because
[02:12:31] you know I got I got a I got a son you know I got three daughters in a son and and the fact of
[02:12:36] the matter is you don't see yourself as much in your daughters as you do in your son right your
[02:12:41] son is a he's a boy a small man and man what I wouldn't give to be able to just like put the
[02:12:49] knowledge in there you know because you see him doing stuff and you go and you could you know
[02:12:53] this is my own flesh and blood by the way that I say hey that's not a good way to handle that
[02:12:59] here's a good way to handle it and he looks at me like I'm an idiot right like how would you ever know
[02:13:05] what it's like to deal with a school teacher you know what to deal with a coach how would you know
[02:13:11] what that's like to deal with another person you know what you're right I'm sure you have this
[02:13:16] you're 15 now I'm sure you got it all figured out this is the one thing I lead kids with
[02:13:23] and I gotta tell you my old man was probably right 95% of the time but did I listen though no
[02:13:29] the work is you know fathers come up to me and be like hey can you talk to my son really loves
[02:13:36] you want to be a seal I what can you leave him with listen to your old man he may not know
[02:13:44] what the right decision is or right path is uncertain things but he will tell you what the wrong
[02:13:49] path is sometimes knowing what not to do it says valuable is knowing what to do you know what
[02:13:54] else I tell when when fathers ask me to talk to their sons I tell the sons I say listen your dad
[02:14:02] actually cares about you more than you do he he wants an outcome for you a good outcome for you
[02:14:10] more than you do I know that doesn't seem possible but for him to come and ask me to like talk to you
[02:14:15] means that what he wants more than anything in the world is for you to be in a good place in the future
[02:14:19] that's what he wants he doesn't want to screw you over this isn't a plot to get you to fail in life
[02:14:25] he actually wants you to win more than anything so you may want to listen to them
[02:14:31] check so it's at this point you do you do so what do you had you did nine deployments overseas total
[02:14:39] ten nine ten deployments overseas and and finally the little voice in your head says you know what I need to
[02:14:47] uh look at something else probably probably the toughest decision uh I had to make I mean a lot of
[02:14:54] guys like a lot of guys thought you were a thirty year that easy he's easy to do a thirty probably
[02:15:00] more and they usually say the same about me and and I can't even talk about this it just came over
[02:15:05] me like a like a wave just crushed me it was just like yep it's it like I'm I'm I'm tapping out
[02:15:13] in the sense at the end of the day you always ring the bell to the community they're like
[02:15:18] I'll get quit it quit her um and uh you know I had one last good deployment with a different group
[02:15:24] it was awesome work with these guys and um you know there's a lot of things you're not one I finally
[02:15:29] felt the fatigue um and the hardest thing to do for any seals to dab out but it's because you know
[02:15:38] that you're no longer like the best guy to push that uniform and and I also was going through
[02:15:45] divorce at the time and um things were just you know things were out of balance and even though
[02:15:53] I wanted to take the XO of a squadron um I knew I was not the best option for the guys and uh even
[02:16:00] though I could probably maintain the job that's not the right answer if I could not keep them uncomfortable
[02:16:05] and different forward then then I wasn't the right guy and so you know we talk about brutal self-assessments
[02:16:12] that was the most brutal self-assessment because I had in that that all you know however good I
[02:16:19] thought I was and what we did what we did it just I'd come to a point where things were to
[02:16:25] go rating and so uh you know over overseas I actually called back to uh you know my my CEO at the time I said I'm done
[02:16:34] and uh this had okay we understand that that's a mature decision you know you wanted me to stay
[02:16:41] he's like I want you to be my XO man he actually referred to or referred to the uh the captain from the
[02:16:48] uh the raid and the Philippines the Ranger the one that did all the planning I'm forgetting the
[02:16:53] name now but he used to call me that um and he said I understand what he wanted to do it's like
[02:16:59] you want to go to uh uh Memphis and like working the details shop I said no hey get me orders to
[02:17:07] to Texas my my XO's probably moved back to Texas that's where she's from and I want to be
[02:17:11] close to my kids I need to repair that relationship um and you've talked about it you know family
[02:17:18] is come second bottom line when you're at war you have so many responsibilities on you one
[02:17:25] Ranger guys whom that the the family is coming second and so that that was my new priority and so you
[02:17:31] test him into the CL community they they made things happen they realign things and they got me
[02:17:36] a billet at the University of Texas Naval ROTC um where one uh Admiral William McRaven was sitting
[02:17:45] as the uh the UT chancellor boom yeah and then so so did you go to school so you got down there
[02:17:52] and was it to get your degree it no it was to be an ROTC instructor and um they'd also
[02:17:59] prep the battlefield to hey the guy wants to get a uh a master's degree or to have one to get
[02:18:03] for so that was the collateral test to get your degree and so uh literally had one late week to
[02:18:09] apply for the the full time MBA program at UT uh took the uh instead of the GMAT I took the uh
[02:18:16] the AC no I'm trying to think of the ACT and um and um uh or GRE the GRE thank you
[02:18:25] and the scores were were not so hot uh and I've had some phone calls and I got in
[02:18:31] and um you know that was a homily experience as well to start you know we we in a sense
[02:18:37] I don't want to say master but we become very good I become being seals at the art of war
[02:18:43] which takes years and years to hone and even then you're never as good as you think you are
[02:18:50] but you put it put time in you built some level mastery and then to step into accounting and finance
[02:18:56] with a bunch of 27 year olds and you're the 39 year old in the uh of course and you have this
[02:19:00] puzzle look on your face because one you've been blown up a couple times and next there went to
[02:19:04] some training where they were like hey you've suffered cognitive degradation to the amount of 50%
[02:19:09] fuck what and I make that Excel spreadsheet and move slower then so I was grabbing these younger kids
[02:19:17] like hey uh show me how to do that man I know what you guys are talking about and it's like okay
[02:19:22] and they all love me they knew there was something different about me and I remember it came time
[02:19:26] for the other first test and one of the younger kids who was actually one of the owners of the
[02:19:30] class who was 26 years like sir one of the last time you took a test on my 14 years ago so I shut up
[02:19:39] but uh so it was it was hard stepping back and doing academic environment people were like
[02:19:44] what did you been to combat this is gonna be easy for you it's like a different type of stress brother
[02:19:49] and like you know one we all drive ourselves to do well and uh the first few tests did not come back
[02:19:56] uh favorable and Mike's really is a calling and so I buckled down and actually did quite well
[02:20:04] but after the first semester the basics of business it gave me a good grounding and I'm like hey
[02:20:11] I think I can do something I actually think I can do something good uh pay back to the community
[02:20:17] they hooked me up to be here where there's no military base I'm supposed to go back to the
[02:20:23] community and I know there's there's a problem with that's getting out especially seals they're
[02:20:27] not getting jobs commensurate with their abilities and company should be swallowing these guys up
[02:20:34] leaders I mean the one thing you can't deny is the military is the preeminent
[02:20:41] leadership training platform in the nation motivating it not saying to the world if I be the
[02:20:46] world I'm not saying there's not great leaders out there that have not been the military actually
[02:20:50] they're they're they're more than than than people like the they there's a lot of great leaders
[02:20:55] and never had military training but as a whole and as you said about the Marine Corps they
[02:20:59] tend to turn out this this this standard product which is a kind of button the same thing with the
[02:21:04] military general and so uh you know talking down on the craving and a great guy named uh
[02:21:09] who is this vice chancellor major general Tony Kukuhu and this guy's become a real big
[02:21:14] matter in the um love them we talked about this and uh basically walked myself into a project
[02:21:22] which we got approved by the McComb's business school 20 vets we we did a analysis into the
[02:21:29] systemic challenges facing veterans when they get out in terms of employment and it was a you
[02:21:33] know 60 page paper which was met with quite a better reception and then again walking myself
[02:21:38] into more work everyone's like hey did we think you guys have a business concept of this uh
[02:21:43] out around of this paper you need to take it one step further won't we'll prove another project
[02:21:47] the next semester and hence something called vetted was formed and to give a quick brief on vetted
[02:21:56] so vetted uh having done all the gap analysis of current programs out there and all the research we did
[02:22:03] we feel we found a solution and actually Huffington post-hilled vetted as revolutionizing the way
[02:22:07] that veterans exit the military so it is bar none the most comprehensive program out there and it's
[02:22:13] still building itself up so uh a partnership between the Wharton University of Texas McComb's MBA
[02:22:19] program and the Texas A&M's business program um MBA program we developed something called the
[02:22:25] veteran accelerated management program it's optional five months of online education through the
[02:22:32] Wharton Business Foundation's course as a preparatory to a two month in-house um
[02:22:39] residence program that basically gives them a very strong business acumen over the you know within
[02:22:46] that two months or the course of those seven months they've received more career development which
[02:22:51] is almost as important as acquiring the business skills then an MBA student gets into years and that's
[02:22:56] how to interview how you're having you know refined and resume optimize your resume like then mock interviews
[02:23:04] but they they hit all the the basic verticals of business even entrepreneurs that they have a business
[02:23:09] idea they came in they have a executable business plan on the back end and for those that want to
[02:23:15] go into industry actually every Thursday Friday they're working on a industry capstone embedded in
[02:23:22] the company so during that eight weeks every Thursday Friday working a project inside a company
[02:23:27] which means industry experience back and going their resume and then two organizations offer
[02:23:34] their placement services for each charge at the end. Actually I'm front over watch and Bradley Morris
[02:23:41] Inc which the two happen to be strategic partners which I'm sure we'll get into but um of the first
[02:23:47] pilot program at the University of Texas McCombs of the 25 veterans all our placed except for one.
[02:23:56] Yeah so that so you just kind of start talking about the next thing obviously we need to talk about
[02:24:02] is you know at some point well you were doing this and here late for an I were with echelon front
[02:24:09] and we work with companies all the time and every company we work with guess what they need they need
[02:24:13] people they need good people they need they need leaders that's what they need and you know as you and I
[02:24:19] discussed this and talked about it and I don't know if I don't know who made the connection mentally
[02:24:26] I think it was you who made the connection mentally like oh wait you you need people and we're making people
[02:24:32] let's figure that out and that's sort of where we got into this idea of echelon front over watch
[02:24:40] we did it was just combining chocolate peanut butter versus pieces it was magical
[02:24:48] it was magic moment sorry with so you know there was a lot of lessons learned from
[02:24:56] that and you know when I started that there was a lot of business matters in mind very successful
[02:25:01] business matters that are like duty needed capitalized this thing and at the time I couldn't see it
[02:25:05] like my ultra is I'm sort of drove like no it needs to be non-profit where you're not
[02:25:09] okay charged people for this and now I recognize that in a capitalistic market you can do more
[02:25:13] good on the for-profit side then you can then I'm profit side we live in a free society free
[02:25:19] enterprise and I remember sitting down and in Austin we do you guys I'm like hey I remember you
[02:25:24] telling me that every company you talked to is like we're gonna get like five of you and that just
[02:25:29] wasn't your game at the time but at the end of the day you know talent is all about leadership
[02:25:34] becoming a talent magnet or having a talent mindset within your organization is about leadership
[02:25:41] and so you know knowing our communities the special operations community and combat
[02:25:45] aviators they broke your resident fighter pilot the badass that you um that could deal
[02:25:50] day we knew we could start something and so we created echelon front over watch what we call EF overwatch
[02:25:57] overwatch being the term that the mission we ran in and reminding and I think like it has a little
[02:26:02] appeal in the sense that now we're overwatching our brothers green braise navy seals
[02:26:07] Air Force PJ CCT's Mar-Sot guys getting out and the direct support come a personnel
[02:26:13] we're overwatching them and helping with their transition we're overwatching the companies that are
[02:26:17] in a war for talent and that's the thing that people don't understand even the seals are always
[02:26:22] hunting for the best talent somebody asked me you know funny enough with with the with the most
[02:26:26] important job in the seal teams is and they thought it was gonna say a troop commander on the front
[02:26:31] lines that that is important that the end of the day that's what we do but I said no it's actually
[02:26:35] big big about budget trucker that is like being a hiring manager you are the filter of the
[02:26:40] talent coming through which ultimately will end up in that troop commander in that that troop chiefs
[02:26:45] hands and there has to be a standard we need to put some of our best guys at Buds can make sure
[02:26:49] that only the best are passing through well the same thing applies to business you are constantly
[02:26:54] in this war for talent and we couldn't think of a better talent pull than combat aviators
[02:27:00] co-repoilets fighter pilots again all the special operations guys in the direct support personnel
[02:27:05] the commander of so come that have the soft skills the leadership skills that you want
[02:27:12] they may lack the hard skills you look at the resume it may not scream right fit the but once you
[02:27:17] get these guys in the interview you see that one they they're leaders that they're humble
[02:27:22] that they're willing to roll their sleeves up and get after it and actually listen and learn
[02:27:27] that is the perfect employee yeah and if you can get more of these guys into your business
[02:27:33] I guarantee you you will create your own army that will dominate your battlefield and whatever
[02:27:38] industry that you're in it's it's it's awesome because
[02:27:44] people every every single time I go talk to a company they'll they'll say man it seems like you
[02:27:49] just it seems like you know you did you do a bunch of research to figure out did you have you been
[02:27:53] working with us and we didn't know about it and I'd be like no well how do you know what
[02:27:57] problems we have it's like oh because you're a company because you're a group of individuals
[02:28:00] you're a group of human beings are trying to make something happen I guess what there's dynamics
[02:28:04] there that happen with all different organizations that together and guess what if you take these
[02:28:09] leaders because there are maze that I can understand their business it's like no I don't understand
[02:28:13] your business I understand leadership that's what that's what Eschalon front we understand leaders
[02:28:17] so we can go in and look at what's going on and say oh you've got a leadership problem here and
[02:28:21] here's how we fix it and so to take that and say you know what we can actually give you people
[02:28:27] that understand leadership and they can help you solve these problems that is like you said
[02:28:34] Reese's peanut butter cup peanut butter and chocolate that's what it is so it's been on
[02:28:40] speaking of bringing on talent like when this whole thing was going down I'm like how
[02:28:46] if I can move mics are really attached along from because guess what that's what we did yeah
[02:28:51] bring bring the band back together and you know that's why that's just been it's been
[02:28:56] awesome and if anyone that's come to the master you know mics you can put it put it on a great
[02:29:03] talk about leadership inside the master for you and everyone loved it I myself included
[02:29:08] and yeah going out working with companies again now we just have someone else on the team
[02:29:14] that can get out there that understands leadership that sees solutions we're bringing it we've
[02:29:19] been bringing you out on a bunch of stuff now so you see other companies and you see
[02:29:22] you're starting to take even what you learned in school put that on top of the practical
[02:29:26] applications that we see now you know the way so you see it everywhere you look so that's
[02:29:31] that's that's another benefit so that's where you're at now talk about getting out
[02:29:37] I mean you talk about what gets you out of the bed in the morning and every company is like
[02:29:41] you love what you do I'm like the fact that jaco wave myself jp Dave Flynn
[02:29:47] are on a phone call talking about leadership I'm like there's nothing that gets us out of bed
[02:29:51] more than that like we actually we love to solve these problems because we've seen them before
[02:29:56] yeah and you know people people often say like well how how are the seals like
[02:30:01] sent on a miswin business I'm like you just said it you're a unit you're a company you're
[02:30:05] dealing with people you deal with the same issues and it has been great I mean how long have I been
[02:30:11] on now three months yeah and I just love it and you know my fiance sees a different person
[02:30:16] because yeah for for the listeners I took a you know high level job in higher education
[02:30:21] executive director of veteran services for the tech say name system and it just you know
[02:30:25] even though the work was rewarding it just wasn't the same as being part of the actual
[02:30:29] front in like jorn has seen she's like you're actually like how did it get out of bed in the morning
[02:30:35] now like yeah with the boys that makes a big difference and like you said you can't even
[02:30:43] shut us up like we will have a like we we got this thing called the tank where we'll get together
[02:30:47] and talk about like a leader like for working with three companies and there'll be leadership
[02:30:53] issues at each one of the companies and so we'll talk about the leadership issue and then how that
[02:30:58] problem should be approached and these calls that are scheduled for an hour will end up on the
[02:31:04] full of three-o-two-and-a-half hours or will end up in the in the tank for three hours sitting there
[02:31:08] going by and because we're learning from it we're also learning how we can apply what we're talking
[02:31:13] about it's just it's just it's just an awesome it's awesome to be part of the organization and
[02:31:18] and like you said to be with people that are just into it into it and you know the funny things
[02:31:23] having got my MBA the one thing that is not addressing any MBA program is leadership yeah
[02:31:30] and they know it and right now you're seeing a lot of MBA programs set up or stand up centers of
[02:31:35] leadership within their their MBA programs and you know I've had some great discussions I mean
[02:31:41] great professors there and so I mean strong leaders because they they were private sector leaders
[02:31:45] before they came back and and spoke but I mean you can and they turn out highly successful
[02:31:51] business practitioners but at the end of the day like it's not a recipe for for leadership training
[02:31:57] whatsoever yeah no that's it's it's been awesome that's that's why the business has gone to
[02:32:01] great because there's no one that's offered what we're doing there's there's there's people say
[02:32:05] well who's your competition I'm like we don't we don't I don't mean this in a negative way but
[02:32:09] because I'm sure there's companies out there that are trying to do something but there's no one
[02:32:12] that's saying hey this is this is what you do this is how you lead this this is the way this will
[02:32:16] apply to your business these are the principles that you can use and you can make happen so yeah that's been
[02:32:21] we've been pretty lucky in the fact that we we saw the correlations between these two things
[02:32:27] and saw them pretty clearly so big good and I'm gonna say so the muster in DC 005 was my first
[02:32:34] muster and naturally these guys know me I'm filled with hate it's just sort of what drives me
[02:32:40] just one of my nicknames is grumpy but you know I was definitely on board because it's
[02:32:48] you guys you guys my brothers I'm like yeah dude I want to love discussin leadership but
[02:32:53] naturally you know I always have a you hold back a little I'm like okay let me see what this
[02:32:58] muster is about and the fact that you guys are changing lives and people are coming up to me
[02:33:04] off one speech and I'm just like dude what is going on like I gave one speech and like
[02:33:10] people were like did you that actually you're perspective as I'll re-change my life I'm like
[02:33:15] well I'm glad to hear that I'm not saying you didn't realize the the impact yeah that it has
[02:33:22] no it's it's it's it's a it's awesome thing to be a part of and when I say I think to be a part of
[02:33:26] it's awesome to be at the muster with the people that are at the muster not just like oh we're
[02:33:31] a part of it and you're not no it's like everyone that's there is a part of it and everyone that
[02:33:36] there is there is contributing to the knowledge that that's being distributed and increased so yeah
[02:33:45] it's it's awesome it's a good time and that's where you're at now it's probably a pretty good place
[02:33:54] to yeah probably we're touching three hours almost right now or two and a half or something like that
[02:33:59] probably a good place to call it and I'm sure we'll do this multiple times again in the future
[02:34:08] it of course obviously thanks for coming on thanks for your service in the Marine Corps in the
[02:34:15] teams and now add a lot of echelon front at echelon front overwatch clearly Mike is out here doing his
[02:34:24] job he's done his job and now maybe we could get echelon to do his job and talk about how we can
[02:34:33] all do our job better in some way somehow sure could you help us with that one yeah sure
[02:34:41] be happy to go more on the path right yeah I'm on the path you're on the path I'm on the path
[02:34:47] right jockel is the path you're on the path you're on the path you're on the path
[02:34:55] trying to be on the path is where I'm at good need to get crazy all right so that being said
[02:35:01] we're all trying to stay on the path the best we can so here here are the ways to do this
[02:35:08] some ways some ways yeah some some suggestions like you're the authority like this is the way
[02:35:14] yeah you're at your ideas yeah proven prove most of these are all proven yeah
[02:35:21] but through experience true you know that's such a affirmative origin origin main dot com's called
[02:35:28] origin our company origin american made stuff geese rash got for jiu jitsu other stuff as well
[02:35:37] a peril why does it pair will get like a like a tone you know because you know how you get
[02:35:45] you know with the whole like a peril like you're not a fashion person well then again a
[02:35:49] peril in fashion is different okay yeah a peril what you wear as a human yeah yeah and fashion
[02:35:55] is something else yeah that you're trying to look a certain way or give a certain flavor to your
[02:36:01] vibe yes i'm not a fan of you're not a fan of flavor to your vibe yes you just your goal i went to
[02:36:08] when i went to college there was this woman who was a Buddhist monk and as i was learning about
[02:36:17] Buddhists they one of the things that they said was like you're not supposed to stand out like just
[02:36:23] just don't stand out just just fit in right that's part of the program yeah technically it's not
[02:36:28] fit in it's just don't stand out okay like maybe one of the two and if you're a practicing
[02:36:33] Buddhist you can come on and breathe brief me on this i'm sure any help this is how i read it okay
[02:36:38] okay don't you know just don't stand out you're just trying to be it's it's like an ego thing right
[02:36:44] it's like don't look at me don't look at me because i'm just i just wear a black t-shirt and a pair of jeans
[02:36:49] don't look at me i'm just a normal dude over here mm nothing special not wearing the laying
[02:36:54] as they call it so but there was a there was a person there that was a Buddhist monk
[02:37:04] and the Buddhist monk wore all the Buddhist garb like the robe and the stuff
[02:37:10] which i don't care hey i was i when i was in Thailand it's awesome it's actually awesome
[02:37:14] seeing the Buddhist monks walk around and they come and gather rice from you in the morning and it's
[02:37:18] it's it's like awesome it's it seems to be the most uh really chill and religion out there right
[02:37:27] and so i'm down with the Buddhists mm-hmm but if you're not in Thailand with
[02:37:35] other Buddhist monks where it's normal well then you what guess what happens when you put on the robe
[02:37:41] stand out and you're saying look at me and that's what i gathered from and i was like hey
[02:37:45] no look at me in fact my goal is like don't look at me that's the goal that's the goal
[02:37:53] look at me yeah oh so okay so i think enough to go too far deep into this
[02:37:59] but we were here hey you brought it up true so it's less about because when the Buddhists
[02:38:06] put on his garb regardless of where he or she is when they put on the garb that's just how
[02:38:12] that's just the garb kind of thing he's there that's not regardless of where we're here where
[02:38:16] he or she is because check it out if you're in Thailand and you put on the normal monk outfit
[02:38:24] sure you look normal yes if you're in a university where everyone's dressed in western clothing
[02:38:31] shorts t-shirts and you put on the garb then guess what you're don't look normal right you stand out
[02:38:39] yeah and it almost says look at me yeah because the true in my opinion like a like if you really
[02:38:47] wanted to to attain that level of ego less enlightenment then you just be dressing like the normal
[02:38:56] people dressed nothing more nothing less just right down the middle right but don't look at me
[02:39:01] right i'm just over here doing what i'm doing but i think and i don't know but i think it's possible
[02:39:07] that it's less about the result of them standing out and more about the effort or lack of effort or no
[02:39:15] effort made to stand out because that's what it is but this is like you can't be attached to like
[02:39:20] your personal it's like what i'm saying so if you if you're used to putting on this the garb
[02:39:27] everyday that's just how i'm like hey i put this on you guys i can stand out and not stand out
[02:39:32] i'm focused on this not really yet it has a good idea in okay well that's cool i'll change my
[02:39:37] attitude towards the monk that i went to college with that's why that's why he's the the
[02:39:43] little color the leader he means because he just opened my man yeah anyway how can origin
[02:39:49] main help us stand that's why if you order something from origin main you could order something that
[02:39:55] is neon green that peat robert's design yeah those fats are there have neon or you could order
[02:40:03] something that's just black or black and gray which is very uh low profile the joggers and
[02:40:10] low profile looking as far as the colors and whatnot but they're joggers it's kind of hip that's
[02:40:17] the thing right now joggers i've got a few of them most comfortable joggers in the world by the way
[02:40:21] proven proven by experts expert anyway how can you keep yourself on the path okay you do
[02:40:27] jj it to you stick with jj it's a new geek boom best geek main and macro by the way see same thing
[02:40:32] this is another question comes up all the time is should i wear the white ghee the black
[02:40:37] ear the blue ghee in my Buddhist mind it was always look the white ghee is just the plain ghee
[02:40:43] that's it you're just wear the plain white ghee that's the way it is i always only wore the white
[02:40:48] ghee guess what i got now black i got black ghee guess what it doesn't matter anymore because
[02:40:53] everybody wears all kinds of different colored geese well they wear white blue or black right there's
[02:40:57] no it no longer is a thing to wear it used to be like if you wore a black ghee you're like hey look
[02:41:02] everyone is like look at me right now no one gave it to cares what color because there's
[02:41:07] a lot of those different colors in circulation so whereas a year ago i'm saying only a year ago
[02:41:12] i would have been like hey listen you need to just stick with the white ghee that's just how right now
[02:41:17] the might have been open if you want to get a black ghee if that's the one that is is you know
[02:41:23] what you're into yeah yeah yeah yeah or the blue one or the blue one or the green or the
[02:41:28] not bright not me on green the me on green just for clarification purposes me on green was one
[02:41:33] of the colors that are in the spats which are compression pants yeah for stop so anyway
[02:41:40] see in the path get a new key continue or start jujitsu boom path that's right on the path
[02:41:46] right in the middle of the path too by the way it's not you know very nothing jujitsu is part of the
[02:41:49] path also joe when i say jogger sure yes they're comfortable i get it come there's no growth
[02:41:55] in the comfort zone whatever but when you're jogging getting out right running doing these things
[02:42:03] you want to put on sweatpants right so to speak and you put on some comfortable made in
[02:42:07] America origin joggers right you're still in the path big time good time actually there you go
[02:42:14] boom so there is growth in the comfort zone in a certain small exceptional capacity we talk
[02:42:20] anymore about clothing i will be like a little bit of a time it's comfort zone i'll be entering
[02:42:25] the fashion area yeah yeah after we like okay wait if we talk about clothing see even by
[02:42:30] me saying like wear this and don't wear that that's no getting in the zone and i shouldn't be in
[02:42:35] which is so I'm not gonna go there I'm done about supplements agree cool supplements okay so
[02:42:41] Mike remember supplements right when you're young take them all yeah whatever's gonna throw
[02:42:47] on the woods the muscle yeah yeah you're right see rest yeah I'm glad Mike's here we can talk
[02:42:52] about this stuff and get talk about it even more so we too what did give me the what the protein
[02:42:58] faster the stronger better in every single way lift more waste be more big
[02:43:03] our supplements and last working out and then smaller t-shirts yeah exactly so but we
[02:43:11] and we never thought about hey what about joint supplements you know like you know when you're
[02:43:15] young you're like a cool maybe for like older folks or something like this and i get it but
[02:43:21] not man give me the protein powder give me the BCA's right so current you know things always
[02:43:30] and evolving new information better information accurate information joint supplements are
[02:43:35] more important than protein powder supplements i would agree how to agree because look if
[02:43:41] your joints aren't working well in lifting heavy you don't need protein supplements because you
[02:43:48] can't lift the weights to get to need the recovery for the protein and for growth and gains
[02:43:53] it's a valid point yeah yeah and up your 40 and you can barely get out of your car after
[02:43:58] driving for one hour yeah and here's the thing that that is funny but it's not funny bill
[02:44:02] no it's not it's real and which brings me to my other my other point which actually all joking
[02:44:07] aside is a big deal this is a big deal that i've actually found when you when you get more healthy
[02:44:14] joints your everyday activity is like way different almost till the point where you didn't realize
[02:44:19] that you had jammed up joints same same you're like dang all this freedom was waiting for me
[02:44:24] on the other side of healthy joints decision making anyway point is jocos some supplements
[02:44:31] joints well mics here i figured we talked about you just got edge kibbing yeah yeah
[02:44:38] yeah and get educated is well anyway joint warfare crill or super crill oil these are things
[02:44:44] that go directly to joints other benefits by the way we can talk about if you want somebody
[02:44:49] ask a twitter i have my knees hurt how does joint warfare know which need to go to
[02:44:55] no yeah here's how it knows yeah i've the answer to that joint warfare knows
[02:45:02] that it goes to both knees okay so it's like hey cover move yeah it's like hey we got a bunch of
[02:45:08] guys right we got a bunch of guys they've been working now they have some issues you're going to say like
[02:45:14] no it knows yeah you just tell it before you eat it before you take it it's a joint warfare
[02:45:18] say it left me yeah he like well you think it feels like that but this is what it really is
[02:45:24] the joint warfare doesn't know the knees know so it's like hey look we're all working out we're all
[02:45:29] doing you know various uh we're moving we're cleaning the yard that's what we're doing
[02:45:32] we're moving our bodies through space we're moving anyway we're doing the yard work right
[02:45:39] me my jockel some other folks that we know right after all it's hot outside yeah and then boom
[02:45:46] one of our my wife comes outside with a big bucket of ice with waters in it right
[02:45:55] jockel's a little bit bigger he may have worked a little bit harder than us he might need some
[02:46:00] more water my work the little bit he might need a certain amount of water but we all need varying
[02:46:05] amounts of water some of the least water you know I mean I mean I mean I mean it looks like I've been in the
[02:46:10] shade maybe not working that much I may need a half bottle of water yeah you're assessing yeah
[02:46:16] so my wife is the joint warfare with all the omega threes and all the all the stuff
[02:46:22] the nutrients you guys are the knee jockel's the bad knee obviously I'm the good knee I need less
[02:46:27] of that stuff so we are the knees choose what how much water we need this thing and this is the
[02:46:32] what's cool about this is this is also this is all scientifically proven 100% that the knee will
[02:46:38] dry in the joint we know the joint warfare doesn't know the knee knows it's a check doctor echo that's
[02:46:44] literally how it works yeah also yeah but yeah very important supplement you'll know just take it you'll
[02:46:49] know and yeah discipline you can take that you might have seen the video that echo Charles made

[02:48:45] me I thank you Dean Lister does not thank you sorry Dean you know you talked about protein not
[02:48:52] being important and I actually think you're wrong well you need protein and you might as well
[02:48:58] get your protein from the what's commonly known as the only real source of protein that's good
[02:49:05] which is milk yes milk is milk do you know what mock is I've seen it yeah he heard here oh you have
[02:49:13] me try it I'm not trying to I'm sorry Dean we'll get spoon up yeah yeah you're you know

[02:49:36] had it and it's yeah see which kind of goes the you think it's kind of intuitive to his whole thing
[02:49:43] you know it's like hey let's make something that's like you know healthy good protein
[02:49:49] clean all this stuff but you know what it has to taste delicious you've seen saying it kind of goes
[02:49:54] against this whole hardcore toughness thing right just like the discipline you made sure it tastes
[02:49:58] good it's been saying isn't that kind of funny it's funny right you think it's funny anyway yeah
[02:50:04] milk good good one replace your dessert with milk and boom no sugar protein it's weird
[02:50:10] there's a substance on earth that you can replace your steak and your dessert with one item
[02:50:16] and I'm not necessarily I'm not saying you gotta do that but take some lunch you know
[02:50:20] cooking a steak is a pain sometimes it takes eight minutes you know we don't have eight minutes
[02:50:25] sometimes boom yeah makes it good milk you're good come to the immersion camp we'll have
[02:50:29] milk the immersion camp in main August 26th through September 2nd you did to the immersion camp

[02:55:05] that's on YouTube as well by the way also if you want to vary up your workout which I think is
[02:55:11] important thing but you know hey people people some people are different but if you want to vary
[02:55:16] up your workout try some new stuff going on at dot com slash jockel you get some new gear
[02:55:22] gear in all capacities by the way all we down to socks we have the club to club heavy club

[02:55:35] did you just for juggling you're like oh no that's not for juggling you'll kill somebody
[02:55:39] he probably yourself but he's see that backs up the point that I said before about those those
[02:55:44] are like oh yeah you know like cool it's a club it looks like one of those clubs that they juggle
[02:55:48] you know it depends you would ever die yeah and you pick it up you're like bro I can't
[02:55:52] juggle that that's like something you work out with and here's the thing yeah there's full
[02:55:57] workouts with that club and there's varying weights whatever anyway you go to the website you can see

[02:56:08] iTunes Google Play MP3 you can get psychological warfare it's an album and yes it has tracks
[02:56:15] and it's just me telling echo and you if you're listening not to be weak at that moment in time
[02:56:22] no it helps it helps you that be weak we're working on the second album well I should say
[02:56:29] I'm compiling the thoughts for the second album which seems like we've determined the working
[02:56:35] title at this point is all your excuses are lies yeah because that one seems to be uh it's
[02:56:41] hit a home with me with everyone y'all juggle white tea you can get it on Amazon in Canada
[02:56:47] and in America you can get dry tea little tea bags that you brew or you can get the can
[02:56:53] which we're gonna put all the big unhealthy energy drinks we're gonna put them out of business
[02:56:59] yeah that's the that's the prediction sure because why would you not drink juggle white tea why
[02:57:04] would you drink something that's gonna kill you when you can drink something that's gonna make you more
[02:57:07] healthy yeah it tastes better and it makes you feel better is there do you have any answer to that
[02:57:13] I don't that's right because I'm right if you're your attitude is wrong
[02:57:19] and uh books if you're on Amazon anyways way the warrior kid and marks mission
[02:57:26] and this week was freedom field manual if you want that on audio it's not an audible book it's
[02:57:33] MP3 iTunes google play all that other stuff extreme ownership which was written by me and my
[02:57:40] brother Dave Babin it's about leadership and we have a follow on book to that called the
[02:57:46] dichotomy of leadership which is coming out September 25th and we're getting some feedback on it
[02:57:53] right now and people are really stoked. Dave and I are definitely stoked on it it's uh cool cool
[02:57:59] book to write it's a little problem the little area the it's the area that people have the most
[02:58:03] problems with yeah how do you balance between being too much of a micromanager and being to
[02:58:07] lose how do you how do you manage the being communicating too much with the group and too little
[02:58:14] with how do you do how do you manage being too close to your people or to
[02:58:19] distant from your people so all those little things all those little balances that you have to figure
[02:58:24] out as a leader there in that book check it out you can preorder it anywhere if you preorder it's
[02:58:29] helpful because that way our publisher who is you know just not aware they're not in the game they're
[02:58:38] not listening to actually some of you know what we need to print a bunch of these books don't
[02:58:46] miss out on the first edition you know what the second edition might end up with it if you don't order
[02:58:51] it but and speaking of which for leadership training if you read the book you need a little bit more
[02:58:58] inside your organization echelon front we saw problems through leadership it's me late babbin jpe
[02:59:03] to know Dave Burke flint cauldron and now as you've heard my brother Mike's are Ellie
[02:59:11] monster 006 monster 006 in San Francisco October 17th and 18th
[02:59:19] Mike you kind of talked about this but your feeling like the monster had will have good impact on people
[02:59:24] it's it most of the ways going to have impact on people it's been shown and just the two days
[02:59:30] I attended I walked away I came right back in Jordan I'm like call it I'm like dude don't call me dude
[02:59:39] I'm blown away in fact the funny thing is you remember there was a green miree that came
[02:59:44] and you know for the listeners hey you know there's there's strife rivalry rivalry between
[02:59:51] the communities all all for fun but even he looked at me and he's like dude this is amazing
[02:59:58] these guys are having an impact and we are going to a very unique place silicon valley
[03:00:04] that is without a doubt one of the most innovative places sometimes lacks leadership
[03:00:09] yep yep has innovative products but lacks leadership so this is going to be magical
[03:00:15] well yeah well yeah that's a good yeah well that's one of the things one of the reasons
[03:00:20] is because the companies we work with up in silicon valley a lot of times they have the
[03:00:25] technical capacity they're smart they they even have the business understanding but the only thing
[03:00:32] that they need especially once they start to grow as they need they need better leadership and so that's
[03:00:36] why we the companies we work up with that we work with up there we know that they need this and so
[03:00:43] that's why we're doing this one in San Francisco October 17th and 18th come on out you can
[03:00:49] register to extremotorship.com you'll see that on this one you'll see like a lot of people
[03:00:56] from the last one because they're like keep coming you know me because not only the updates or
[03:01:00] whatever but just like how you're saying earlier where the more okay you learn something then you
[03:01:05] go to the field you know you practice you you know practice you perform thing you're like oh wait okay
[03:01:11] now it other problems arise you like this problem now is another problem yeah because I see
[03:01:16] differently now I see more of that so boom I'm going back to the mustard yeah seems in and then
[03:01:21] boom back to the field so you'll see people there every time so you get it to do it and have
[03:01:25] going to tell you this so out of uh zero five this this police officer came up to me or I should say
[03:01:31] mounting from Nova Scotia second year I want to come to my department then yeah when he saw
[03:01:36] that I spoke with the Louisville Kentucky uh which are my boys police department major police
[03:01:41] department he's like hey you need to come out so we're coordinating I get to go out to Nova Scotia
[03:01:47] police is zero five that's awesome you know speaking of law enforcement is we because of the
[03:01:56] because of the popularity of the mustard and because there's usually law enforcement military
[03:02:01] border patrol firefighters paramedics all first responders basically people in uniform
[03:02:04] they've they've been coming to all the musters but we wanted to do one that's a little bit
[03:02:10] cheaper focused on those types of jobs so we're doing something in Dallas Texas September 21st
[03:02:16] it's called the role call if you want it it's the same register register to streamownership.com
[03:02:21] you got to be one of those you got to be one of those jobs to come to that but that's going to be
[03:02:25] focused on that sort of dynamic leadership that you get into in those situations so that's the role
[03:02:33] call zero zero one September 21st of course now one more thing to talk about
[03:02:37] echelon front overwatch efo overwatch so check it out real simple to put this out if you're
[03:02:46] a veteran and your either in the military and you're getting ready to transition out of the military
[03:02:52] soft soft support combat pilots if you're in that situation go to efoverwatch.com or
[03:03:03] if you're a business that wants to bring this type of leadership into your team then go to
[03:03:10] efoverwatch and you see there's real simple instruction to follow and we'll proceed to move down
[03:03:16] the path of putting the best people in the best positions and on top of that if you want to
[03:03:25] hang out with us a little bit more virtually until we see you in San Francisco at the monster
[03:03:29] or until we see you at the roll call or until we see you at the immersion camp in Maine then we're
[03:03:34] on the inner webs fully on the inner webs on Twitter, Instagram and dash of baseball key.
[03:03:41] Mike is MJ Surrelli it's mjsa r a i l l e that's him on Twitter. He's Mike Surrelli on Instagram
[03:03:54] and he's Michael Surrelli on dash of a is he bocky and of course echo is at echo Charles and
[03:04:02] I am at jockelwillic echo anything else yeah yeah actually so going back you did mention
[03:04:12] you said mini buds do you say mini buds that's where you went through not bud mini buds.
[03:04:18] Mini buds so I think it's called something's called something else now and I can't recall so
[03:04:22] basically there is a vast pool of kids in college and at the naval academy that want to
[03:04:28] try out to be officers in the sealed teams. Yes because the competition is so fierce
[03:04:33] the summer before they grew to do it actually become commission as officers in the navy
[03:04:37] they actually have to compete for the few billets that exist for buds officers. Okay and so
[03:04:45] you've got I think you anywhere from 100 to 100 actually probably more than that trying to get into
[03:04:50] mini buds and there's only so many I think like there's 30 per class they run too many buds every
[03:04:55] summer of about 30 candidates each so 60 total and there's probably like 500 kids compete
[03:05:01] in for the slots and then amongst those 60 they're only going to slack I think like 50 percent
[03:05:06] 30 that actually can step into buds as navy engines and try to become navy seal officer. So
[03:05:13] you know it goes back to that talent everyone is always in a war for down looking for the best
[03:05:19] candidate. So you go to mini buds you pass then you go to buds. Yeah. Definitely. If you're lucky
[03:05:26] if they select you got you to perform well it. Oh okay so again this is just for the officer
[03:05:31] pipeline if you're in a list of guy you're in the navy and you go to buds there's no many buds
[03:05:35] for you. They do have a prep course now up in Chicago after boot camp you stay and you try
[03:05:42] they try and get you ready for buds. But it's different obviously. Yeah it's different okay.
[03:05:47] I don't think that's even a selection it's not a selection it's not a selection it's not. No it's just
[03:05:50] it's not a selection they could deselect you but the purpose isn't deselect. No I think the purpose
[03:05:54] was to to see if we could statistically increase the number of people that get through buds and
[03:06:00] actually I think it has proven a fact that the end of the day it's one thing for whatever reason it's
[03:06:05] an 80 percent of tuition rate like almost all the time or 70 to 80 percent. So one of my friends said this
[03:06:12] about buds, about passing buds that this is a fact it's not the the tell tale but this is a factor
[03:06:18] where if you're in a group that and this is going to go back to leadership I kind of interestingly
[03:06:24] if you're in a group where people are real negative and then you know when you're negative you
[03:06:28] want to blame other people or just if you're negative person whatever you don't want take on
[03:06:32] shit. So if if a guy is seemingly getting gangged up on you know like if everyone's like hey you're
[03:06:39] not pulling your wig you know everyone's getting frustrated and then everyone's like
[03:06:43] harping on one guy that makes them quit way quicker than if like everyone's like yeah it's okay
[03:06:51] we can do this you know like you like if you have a leader who's like hey it's all good guys come on
[03:06:55] we got this we got this kind of cheer everybody on and saying like hey we're all a team here kind of
[03:06:59] thing but if you're like hey you're holding us back and everyone's ganging up on that guy he'll
[03:07:04] quit way quicker that's what you say. Chuck there's only one exception I think that's probably accurate
[03:07:10] to yeah for the most part there's only one person that I think that I've seen
[03:07:15] sort of defied at and that was run Joe yeah you would not get that guy's admin and yeah tough as nails
[03:07:24] yes seems like that would be a factor but yeah you get brother there's just guys like that and we're like
[03:07:29] nope I'm all die before I quit you know it was just simply not option no matter how deep you go
[03:07:35] it's crazy yeah you ask me what what to do how to get through buds don't quit that's it
[03:07:42] it's crazy Mike any closing thoughts yeah well yeah few just people to thank one you know
[03:07:51] to you and all the boys that I served with across all the commands I served in man it was
[03:07:55] it is a brotherhood while Mike now's gotten along with all of you definitely learned something from
[03:08:01] everyone and it is a brotherhood that you will never replace and that was an honor sort of long
[03:08:06] side of this guy's and then I think the last two is one my kids Cameron and and Kaden I mean that
[03:08:13] is any man's legacy is how you raise your kids and they mean the world to to me and then the last
[03:08:20] person who's changed my life is my fiance which you know I hope you guys are reserved in the date
[03:08:26] Jordan who's changed my perspective on a lot of things and you know helped me through a what is
