00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 This is Jockelpodcast number 334 with echo Charles and me, Jockelwillink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.000 We were sitting by a fixed section of reprod, a logging term for young timber. When I heard the high pitched bugle of a male elk.
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000 The 15-foot tall trees shifted like the parting of the seas and a massive bull stepped out onto the logging road.
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000 I was leaning on my knees, trying to look invisible as the black horned six by seven bull bore holes through me with his eyes.
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000 He was in bull range and when I decided that I should try to kill him, the thing I'd been practicing to do for months,
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000 I realized that it felt like my arms were asleep and my heart was beating out of my chest.
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000 I don't know if I can even pull this bull back, the bull stood there only 40 yards away from me.
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000 There was no question I should be able to kill him. I'd shot thousands of arrows at this distance all summer.
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000 I pulled back the bowstring and released.
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000 The arrow missed the bull. Shop behind his butt. That meant I was about seven feet off my mark, which was ridiculous.
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000 This was what I'd called, Shitting the Bed. My first bowshot of my life at an animal couldn't have been much worse.
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000 I didn't get another opportunity that day, but something was ignited inside me.
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000 I'd never had any real ambitions or goals for myself, but something changed.
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:51.000 Now all I knew was I wanted to kill a bull. So right after that first day hunting debacle, I became obsessed and hunted for the next 18 days straight, determined to succeed.
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000 That's right, 18 days straight.
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000 Finally on September 13th, 1989, I killed my first bull.
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000 The first animal that ever died from one of my arrows was a small, young, spike bull.
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000 Granite, it wasn't anything like the giant six by seven. I blew it on, but it didn't matter.
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000 It was my first bow kill and my first bull elk.
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000 Truth is, I didn't deserve a big bull yet. I hadn't paid my bow hunting dues.
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000 And size aside, I didn't know many guys who had even killed a bull with their bow.
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000 So my spike bull accomplishment still felt special.
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000 It was almost a three week grind, but it was worth it.
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000 Some people live their whole lives and never finding their true passion.
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000 I was 20 years old when I first tasted bow hunting success and that marked the time I discovered my purpose.
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000 Suddenly, I had something in my life to focus my energy on.
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000 I quit college and quit about everything else just to be able to bow hump more.
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000 I'll never forget where this journey began and how long it's taken to hammer away at a dream.
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000 We all have to start somewhere.
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000 Nobody is born great at bow hunting.
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000 The average success rate on hunting a bull elk with a bow is about 10%.
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000 So that's one kill every 10 years or one guy out of ten who is going to have success.
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000 That's never going to be good enough for me. Never was, never will be average sucks.
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000 Nowadays, I earn success on virtually every hunt in every state every year.
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000 So I expect to be 100% when the average is 10%.
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000 That said, I didn't wake up one morning, great at bow hunting.
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000 I've worked for more than 30 years to get where I am today.
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000 It's not talent. It's drive.
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000 It's not raw ability.
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000 It's endurance.
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000 Hunting is my passion and being successful at it is what fuels me every day to get better than the day before.
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000 And that right there is an excerpt from a book which is called Endur,
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000 how to work hard outlast and keep hammering.
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000 And if you haven't figured it out yet, this is a book written by an individual named Cameron Haynes.
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000 Cameron Haynes is one of the most highly respected and successful bow hunters in the world.
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000 In order to get there in order to get to that level of expertise and ability,
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000 he has lived a relentless life of utmost discipline
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000 and unmitigated focus.
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000 And I guess since he's got this book, he's written some other books that he's an author
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000 and I guess since he trains hard, he's an endurance athlete and I know that he represents brands
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000 and I know that he's founded and runs businesses
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000 but first and foremost, he's a bow hunter, one of the best in the world.
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000 And we are lucky enough to have him here with us tonight to share some of his experiences
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000 and some of his lessons learned along the way and how they apply not only to bow hunting, but to life.
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000 Cam, thanks for joining us, man.
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000 It's an honor to be here. Thank you guys.
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000 That's a...
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000 That first one, huh? That first shot was a...
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000 The first shot you took was a miss.
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000 Do you know what you did wrong?
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000 Yeah, I mean, I just was wrapped up in the moment, adrenaline was going crazy.
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000 How it gets course in three or veins, it's kind of a new experience
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000 and so intense with that bow coming in and the reprod spreading like I said,
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000 I could see the tree shaking as it came down, I'm just like,
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000 holy shit, what is going on? And then now, and I've been watching the bull because I was up there
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000 the night before on Friday night, Saturday morning that season opened.
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000 So I've been watching from about, I don't know, my own half a liter of myel.
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000 So I knew the bull and I knew what the focus was and it was a big bull and I knew all that from afar,
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000 but once he gets in the showtime,
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000 I think I just hammered that trigger of my release and probably peaked,
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000 and I shot and just missed.
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000 It was brutal, it's rough.
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000 Well, we'll get to some of the more of those experiences and I'm sure you'll...
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000 I'm sure I'll share some of my very limited experiences, but definitely can get kind of crazy out there.
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000 That's why we love it that it can city.
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000 Yeah, no, yeah, what we'll get to those kind of things is,
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000 I think the term that you use with me is it can be heartbreaking.
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000 And I was kind of surprised, the first time I went hunting, I thought that no one told me that it was like a 10% success.
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000 I kind of thought like, hey, you just go out there and when you're used to shooting with a rifle,
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000 like, hey, you shoot it something, first of all you can shoot a lot further away.
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000 Second of all, when you shoot it, it's easier to hit it where you want to hit it,
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000 and it has so much force and a bullet that it's going to cause some massive damage and, you know, shit dies.
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000 Yeah, it's not so easy with a bow and arrow.
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000 No, more variables, and then it kills by him, right?
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000 So, hold a different thing, shock, muscle bone, get broke apart with the gun, with the archery, it's him, right?
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000 So it's where you hit that animal.
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:16.000 Well, let's, let's, before we jump into where you're at now, let's go back a little bit to the beginning and where you came from and where you grew up.
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000 Going to the book, this book,
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:29.000 uh, freaking awesome, it order it, order it right now. We're going to cover a little bit about it today. So many stories in there. So much detail.
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000 It's just an awesome read.
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000 So let's go to the book a little bit and talk about where you came from.
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000 You say here, the biggest legend around Eugene, or Oregon, when I was a kid, I'll wait, what's it, what's the stress on Oregon?
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000 How are you supposed to say it or again? How do, how do, how are you supposed to not say it or a gun?
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000 There you go. I'm, I'm David close to that one.
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:59.000 Or again, all right, the biggest legend around Eugene, Oregon, when I was a kid, was long distance Olympic runner, Steve Prefontein.
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000 But for me, it was my dad.
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000 Bob Haynes was Superman in my eyes.
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000 In a town known as Tracktown, USA, my dad excelled at the sport.
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000 He earned a full ride scholarship at the University of Oregon in gymnastics and after flunking out there,
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000 earned a full ride at Oregon State for Track, where they wanted him to pull, pull, pull and hide jump.
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000 That's, that's a freaking athlete.
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000 If you're gymnastics and track, yeah, he was, he was a beast.
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000 And he just grew up. That's always did track.
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000 You know, Junior Nationals, I had this scrapbook. So I'd like always just look at a scrapbook and headlines and all these things and just a,
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000 just a, great, great athlete.
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000 Beast.
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000 You say, he and my mom fast forward a little bit. He and my mom, Linda Brown, met at South Eugene.
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000 I never forgot something she told me when I was five years old.
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000 Your dad legs are so muscular. There's hard as this wood table.
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000 She said, she pointed out our, oh, coffee table.
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000 Little comments like that made him seem larger than life.
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000 We covered a book on this podcast. It's called Wooden Leg.
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000 And it was about, it was about an Indian.
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000 And his name was Wooden Leg and the reason they called him that was because he could just like go and just keep going.
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000 Yeah.
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000 So got them genetics.
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.000 Yeah, I guess so.
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000 Yeah.
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:40.000 Going a little bit more forward again on May 30th, 1975, Steve Prefontane died in an automobile accident earlier that evening.
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000 Steven won a 5,000 meter run at University of Oregon's Hayward Field. He was only 24 years old.
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000 The place where he crashed on the winding narrow skyline Boulevard is now known as pre-es Rock.
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000 Four years earlier, another car accident happened only 10 minutes from pre-es Rock.
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000 Nobody got killed, but it might have helped tear a family apart.
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000 It's one of my earliest memories of my parents when they were still married.
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000 In fact, it's one of my only memories. I was four years old and I woke up hearing my mother yelling.
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000 I went to find her standing by the door, heading into the garage, talking loudly and frantically to my dad.
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000 When I stepped to her side and followed her eyes, I noticed the side of my dad's car was damaged as if he had just hit another vehicle.
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000 I didn't know this at the time, but my dad was now Catholic.
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000 Thankfully, Bob Haynes was able to walk away from this accident, not long after that, my parents divorced.
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000 That's what was going on when you were...
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000 That's like your earliest memories are really, you say, your only memories of your parents being married.
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000 Then they were divorced, not to go back and forth, but them together.
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000 That's about it.
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000 One other night, my dad, he once college was over, he'd play softball.
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000 He came home one night and I remember he was a slid in the base and he had a bunch of blood running down his knee.
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000 I remember sitting there and watching TV and looking at that.
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000 So those two, that's about it.
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000 That night after his softball game with blood, and then when he was drunk and hit a car.
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:24.000 You go through in the book, you know, you talk about the, you know, your mom, she's...
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000 Well, I mean, she's got a kind of carry on with her life, right?
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000 I mean, she starts dating other guys.
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000 Eventually, she gets married to who ends up being your stepdad.
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000 How old were you and that happened?
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000 I think five.
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000 And what did he do for work?
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000 He drove roller for the paving company.
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000 It sounds like he was a bit of a booser, too.
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000 Yeah, yep, definitely.
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000 Definitely had drinking issues and then, you know, he wasn't my dad, so I hated him.
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000 I don't think he liked me.
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000 Definitely didn't seem like it.
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000 So, yeah, it's, you know, whatever it happens.
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000 That's just the way it seems to go, doesn't it?
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000 Sometimes with the stepdad's.
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000 Yeah, but it's a tough job for them.
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000 They're coming in.
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000 They're, the woman better be pretty hot.
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000 If they're going to have to deal with you.
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:23.000 That's all I know.
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.000 And there's two of you.
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.000 Is there two of you?
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.000 So it's you and your brother, right?
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.000 Yeah, well, young brother.
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000 He's a couple years younger.
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000 So yeah, it's, my mom came with some baggage.
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000 Yeah, instant, we used to say in the SEAL teams, like when a guy would meet up with some girl
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000 or start like seriously dating a girl,
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000 and maybe even get married to a girl that had a couple of like instant family.
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000 Yeah, you know, you don't get any like a normal normal, you get married.
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000 You have like the honeymoon period or whatever.
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000 Two, three years just you and this girl, but no, you got instant family.
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.000 I know.
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000 What are you doing on Saturday?
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000 You're freaking doing yard work and like there's no honeymoon period.
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000 I know, I know, it's rough.
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.000 Roll and straight into it.
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.000 Yeah.
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000 And then you got young cam who hates you.
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000 Yeah.
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000 And you know, I have since my dad wasn't around, I just had this vision of my dad and from what I heard
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000 and the scrapbooks.
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000 And so then this guy who comes in with who the fuck are you?
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000 What have you done?
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.000 Drive roller.
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000 You know, so it's a tough hand.
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000 It's like, it's no win for sure for him.
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.000 You got some crazy stories in here.
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000 I had to pull this one out though.
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:44.000 I had this, this would kind of struck me because it seems like this kind of shit happens to everyone in some way, shape, or form.
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000 You got this going on when I was in third and fourth grades.
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000 My mom worked with and became friends with this lady at the phone company.
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000 I remember her being very pretty and nice.
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000 They went out on weekends leaving Pete and me with the woman's teenage sons to babysit.
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000 My step dad had a heartily and so did the husband of my mom's friend.
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000 So they would go out on road trips or maybe just out for the night while it was a long time ago.
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000 I don't remember all the details.
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000 There are a few things I do remember that might always haunt me.
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000 The teenage brothers weren't the greatest babysitters.
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000 They used drugs and made me and my brother fight in front of their friends.
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000 They'd yell and scream and treat it like entertainment, coaching us and how to hit each other hard.
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000 Whenever there was blood, the boys yelled louder and got even more fired up.
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000 Pete and I didn't like it, but I don't remember having a choice or maybe it was the way for us young boys to try and earn approval from the older boys.
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:43.000 The brothers watched us at our house as we had a pool table and they got and then they and their friends had something to do as they acted crazy and got drunk and high during those stressful nights.
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000 They made me smoke pots so I couldn't tell on them.
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000 How old were you?
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.000 Third grade.
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.000 Damn.
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:58.000 We do whatever they said so I smoke pot and then they put shaving cream in my mouth as they said it mask the scent of pot.
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000 The younger brother did most of the communicating with us and said if we told on them they would tell my mom that I smoke pot too.
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000 If I hadn't already learned that life wasn't always going to be fun and loving, I did then.
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:20.000 My young eyes were open to the fact that there were people in this world that you could never trust and that would hurt you for entertainment.
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000 That's freaking crazy.
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:36.000 And you go on to say that the one brother, one of these two brothers ended up dead of a heroin no overdose and the other one tripped out on some kind of drugs and killed one of his friends.
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:48.000 Yeah, he took mushrooms that not long after. I mean during that whole time and thought as friend was the devil I think is what it was and ended up killing him.
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000 It's when he's 15.
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000 Damn.
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000 So this is a rough scenario you're left now.
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000 How often are you getting to go to your dad's?
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:20.000 My dad was, you know, he's having issues of his own with drink and you know he'd have girlfriends and I think you worked at a, he was a bartender at the black forest as a tavern there off a lamb at Eugene and so yeah he's.
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000 You know he's young too.
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000 You know, you're 20 some years old. You don't want to have to take care of some kid.
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000 So it's pretty much mostly most of the times at this point is spent with your mom.
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000 Yeah.
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000 You go through more stuff about that. I'm going to fast forward a little bit to middle school.
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000 Middle school you're trying to try to make things happen even to middle school. You got a paper route. You're doing strawberry pick.
00:17:48.000 --> 00:18:00.000 Yeah. You got you got you put this quote in here. You said during this period of my life with all the time to be in my own head and that's when you're out taking strawberries or you're out delivering papers.
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000 One constant thought came to my mind.
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000 This sucks.
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000 That's pretty heavy for a freaking middle school kid.
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:25.000 Yeah. I remember because at that time the local paper is every day. So I'd have to get up a four and you know Oregon, especially lamb of valley there. I mean it rains a lot, especially in the winter.
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000 Dark as shit.
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000 For in the morning I'm out there loaded up my little canvas bag. He put papers on the front and back.
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000 It's kind of strong over your shoulders and then I just ride my bike to the houses in deliver.
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:46.000 I'd have to get that all loaded up at the paper box. He'd come and drop papers off like it two in the morning. I'd go out there or four and get all that and just pouring down rain and I'm just like
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:59.000 It sucked. I mean it was it you know I know lots of people have paper routes, but yeah, I'd given everything else. Then at that time I had moved in with my dad because I hated my stepdad so much.
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:14.000 So I was and I didn't miss anybody but my brother basically we'd kind of been in it together. And so I'd live with my dad my my step or I mean my brother would stay with my mom because he didn't really know my dad that well because he's so young.
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:22.000 And and yeah, so it was like given everything else and then that's situation. Yeah, I feel like a lot.
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:35.000 Fast forward a little bit more. You say, since my dad was some legendary track guy, I decided to attempt to follow in his footsteps.
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:47.000 During one particular track meet, I was excited to see my step mom candy coming watch me knowing that she was going to tell my dad how I did. He wasn't there himself, but his spirit loomed large like it always did.
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000 It was really hard to get his attention in athletics since he was gone traveling around with junior national teams.
00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:01.000 You couldn't do regular shit and be celebrated. I knew I had to make my marks or I decided I would do it in the 800 meter race at that meet.
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000 When the gun went off, I took off as if it was a 200 meter dash.
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:18.000 I ran like Steve Prefontein going out as hard going out hard and refusing to let go of the lead for sure while a very short while I raised at the front.
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000 But by the end of the first lap, I was dying.
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:31.000 I still remember the guy who won the race Greg Suter. He was a natural track guy who won all the time. He looked like a runner tall and lean.
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000 I was the short, leg-and-kid gasping at the end of the race and finishing last.
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000 I was thankful my dad hadn't accompanied my step mom to the meet. This was my normal. I just didn't have it.
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000 That's what I drew up with.
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000 Life has always been agrined.
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000 Coming out of the gate hard.
00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000 800 meters, I heard somebody talking about 800 meters.
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000 There were saying, there's people that run everything from a 5K to a marathon.
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000 That's all what's the word, sort of fun stuff that people do.
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000 But there's no one that goes out.
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000 Hey, we're running an 800 this week because it sucks so horribly.
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000 It's the half mile basically a sprint.
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000 It's tough. Especially when you're not, you know, I just, it was just a kid.
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000 Middle school kid wasn't born to do it.
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000 So is this like six seventh grade? What grade is this?
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000 I think that was probably, I'd say, seventh or eighth.
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000 Yeah.
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000 And you got your ass beat.
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000 I didn't, did you feel like, you know, I mean, this is the kind of thing.
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000 That's a kind of thing that said kids like just often the other direction.
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000 Did you feel any of that? Did you just to keep doing track?
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000 No, because then then my dad moved to Portland so I moved up there, which is a much bigger city than Eugene.
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000 And then I didn't even get a chance to compete with anything.
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000 Because if I wasn't good at a smaller school, I'm not getting anything.
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000 So I remember up there, you were a small fish and a small pond.
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000 When you got to the big pond, you were like a meno.
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000 Oh my god, it was not even. I was, I might as well.
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000 I didn't exist as far as the school goes.
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000 I mean, it's just like nobody knew me.
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000 I never made one friend.
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000 I mean, it was, I remember it.
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000 I remember it's laughing.
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.000 I know.
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:30.000 No, my asshole.
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.000 Maybe a little bit.
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000 It's, it's just, I'd be laughing too.
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000 It's like, I remember I had zits all in my chin.
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000 You know, I'm like, God, so I did mull on.
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000 I took out my dad lived in a pretty good area.
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000 He opened this record store in downtown Portland, like collectible records.
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000 That's what he loved to do.
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000 And so I would be out in Beaverton, which is out of Portland.
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000 And I would go in mull yards and get get some money that way.
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000 Nobody's given me money.
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000 And yeah, I mean, my brother would come up.
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000 I remember what time he came up to visit and he didn't like going up there.
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000 But we played one on one football.
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000 I was better than him because I was two years older.
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000 So it was like that was my, that was glory to me.
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:16.000 That was glory.
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000 Like reliving the one on one football match with your little brother.
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000 You do end up doing your first hunt with your stepdad.
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000 What was that all about?
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000 That was, you know, he grew up in a real small town in eastern Oregon, Echo Oregon.
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000 And so they would do this big deer camp.
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000 So it's a tradition every year that have a deer camp where they'd have a wood stove and a big, you know,
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000 like a outfitters tent.
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000 They'd play cards and drink and, you know, that was, that was rifle deer hunting.
00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000 So like I say in the book, you know, I got ahead into my stepdad for even taking us over there because I guarantee his brothers,
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000 which were just they're all bad asses pretty intimidating like ranch guys, you know, big,
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000 they had a big ranch outside of Echo Oregon.
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000 And then we got these kids, you know, Greg steps on.
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000 They're probably like, what is this?
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000 You know, guys, they don't want kids around, right?
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000 And so I did, meaning my brother were out.
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000 And I saw these deer coming up the hill.
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000 And I thought I saw a spike horn on one of them, which made it legal.
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000 So it was because it was a buck, had to be a buck.
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000 And I shot it. My brother said, you shot it, though.
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000 And I'm like, no, I didn't, I didn't know for sure.
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000 I was like pretty sure, but I was 100% sure.
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000 After he said that, I was like, oh my God.
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000 So, you know, what's the biggest stroke you could do?
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000 Shoot so many illegal animals, right?
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000 So anyway, it turns out it was legal and I got it.
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000 That was my first deer and I was 15.
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000 And did you get like the rush?
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000 Did you enjoy that?
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000 I don't remember that part.
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000 I just remember maybe I finally did something good.
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000 Like, like, get approval from the man.
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000 So.
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:24.000 Now despite everything and I like I said, I skip them through a bunch of the book.
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000 There's more detail in here.
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000 But you eventually say this, it's easy to use your childhood as a crutch.
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000 Instead of seeing it as a chisel, there are a lot of divorces out there.
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000 So that means a lot of kids come from broken homes.
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000 I always hear people say, my family is so dysfunctional.
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000 Using it as an excuse or something.
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000 I really have valid excuse because everybody's family is dysfunctional in some way.
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000 There are so many crutches people want to use to justify themselves.
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000 But for me, you have to eliminate every single one of them.
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:55.000 Get rid of them all.
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000 Then tell yourself, it's up to you.
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000 What are you going to do now that you let go of all those crutches?
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000 I could blame alcoholism on a shitty childhood, but I don't.
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.000 Blaming others isn't an easy way out.
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000 Solid advice.
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000 You got to take ownership of what's going on in your world.
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000 Stream ownership.
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:20.000 That's a good call.
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000 It's a good idea.
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000 You know, I was just talking to some people this past past week.
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000 And I was saying, isn't it crazy?
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000 I said, I wrote this book.
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000 And what we wrote about in this book is, hey, you should take responsibility for your actions.
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000 That's the main underlying premise.
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000 It isn't it shocking that people almost treat that like a novel idea.
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000 But wait, let me jot this down.
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000 And the thing that I was also explaining this group of people is that it's really heavy.
00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:04.000 When you start to look at your, you know, you look at your life, you look at your health, you look at your business, you look at your family, you look at your relationships.
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000 And you look at all those things that are messed up in all those areas.
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000 And when you say all those things, all those problems in my business, my life, my health, all those things are my fault.
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000 That's really a heavy weight to bear.
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000 But it's also extremely liberating because if it's all your fault, you're the one that can fix it.
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000 You're the one that can get your business back, you can repair the relationships, you can get yourself healthy.
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000 You can take control of all those things.
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000 And that's the exact same thing you're saying here, when you're just blaming your childhood, your parents or your alcohol, the alcohol, all these other things.
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000 Then you just become a victim to those things and that's not what can you change.
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:41.000 You're just a victim.
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000 It's happening to you and you need to go make things happen yourself, not let them happen to you.
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000 Definitely one of the underlying themes in this book you put out.
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000 Fast forward a little bit to high school, which you start to get into as a freshman entering a new high school.
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:07.000 I had no confidence in zero success to point to or build momentum off of life got worse after I decided to live with my dad when he moved to Portland.
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000 Suddenly I found myself in this big school, I didn't want to attend where I didn't know anybody.
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:23.000 I struggled in my classes, I earn mostly d's as a freshman, I ate like shit and wasn't active, so I started gaining weight and to make matters worse, act me became an issue.
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000 Basically, your teenager too and it's just going to happen.
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000 But there was some studs, I'd see the studs and they didn't see my heads.
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000 And they didn't seem overweight or looking down at the floor as they walked by everybody.
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000 So, wasn't everybody.
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000 That's a rough one.
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000 You said this though, fast forward a little bit, soon I realized things had to change.
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:04.000 That the situation in Portland was dire, feeling alone and isolated caused me not to give any effort to school or make friends, my grades were all d's.
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000 I was overweight and insecure, so I moved back with my mom for my sophomore junior and senior years.
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000 I knew it hurt my dad, but I was miserable and felt desperate.
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000 I then attended Mohawk High School and what is it, Marcola?
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:31.000 Yep, in Marcola. It was a small school and a small town. Marcola was a logging community with a lot of guys working out the woods. I love growing up in a small town, but like many others from humbling, humble beginnings, I carried low expectations and no dreams.
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000 I wasn't looking down the road.
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:40.000 The change of schools didn't help me because even though I never did my homework and I wasn't considered smart, I also wasn't dumb.
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000 I began to get good grades. I ended up getting straight days when I was a senior.
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000 It's a freaking dramatic change.
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000 I got so lucky because I joined the military and I just got put on a path.
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000 This is what you got to do.
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000 Now that structure is important.
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000 Freaking so good.
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000 Now you're in a playing football.
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:12.000 And do you think that impacted sort of, you start playing football. You start having some structure and discipline around that. Does that help your grades? You want to get good grades just to play football or anything like that?
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:21.000 Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I just had a little, I felt smaller school. Maybe he's back in the small pond again.
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:38.000 So I felt a more confident and then playing building a bond with people like the other guys on the team and on our, my road, we lived on the winland road. So there's a bunch of good athletes that live there. So we'd get together and play basketball or football.
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:49.000 And so just that, just competing. I think competition is what is what life, I mean, that's kind of a mistake.
00:30:49.000 --> 00:31:11.000 I felt for a long time I made with the raise of my own kids is I learned right there that life is competition and competition is what made me like, hey, I got, I have to go one on one with, we just do these drills like football, one on one. You try to get over this line. They try to get over this line. It's just whoever can you stop them or he can he stop you.
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:38.000 So I realize those battles, that's what makes especially a man is like, we got to compete. That's what we're here for. So when I kind of skip to head, but with my kids, I like, no, you guys life is going to break you if you're not built for this shit. So then I thought, well, maybe that pushed them too hard to compete. So it's like, you know, how life is you're like, one all one way or all the other.
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:49.000 But anyway, I was learning how to compete there and it gave me confidence. And you start running then too. And you had a buddy Donnie Manila, is it?
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000 And you guys are sort of sort of sort of best friends scenario and he's he's a quarterback. Yep.
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000 And you're his wide receiver. Yep. So you guys are bros out freaking. Oh, yeah, practicing every. Yeah, and shape and getting half grit.
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:13.000 Yeah. You talk about the fact that you're you kind of had to be self sufficient. I mean, this whole time, which is definitely good. Yeah.
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:21.000 Yeah, it's tough at that time, but it's good for any any person. Yeah, eventually you're going to have to, you know, take care of yourself.
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:30.000 Yeah, you know, going back to that competition thing. I know in the SEAL team is we always joke around like if you're with another SEAL, whatever you're doing is a race.
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:38.000 Well, whether or not, sometimes it can get pretty stupid, because sure it's cool when you're running arts, cool when you're shooting, but then it's like, hey, we're going to go drink.
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000 Let's see if you can do better. Yeah, not as great to win that one.
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000 Yeah, that's not a great one.
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:59.000 You also end up going to your grandma's house, which seems like, I'm like, oh, that's that's quaint, but it's a 20 mile bike ride. You got it. Yeah, so it's a 40 mile round trip.
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000 What are you doing up there?
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:13.000 She lived in town, so she lived by Hayward Field. I lived in the house skirts on this in that small town. So I would ride there and sold two lane road all the way into town.
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:34.000 And then I would hang out watching TV, walk up to Eldon's market. She had a tab up there, so to go buy stuff. Good end Amazon pool just kind of play basketball hang out, but that was like my I could get away from my stepdad. My dad could swing by because it was his mom. So I could see my dad maybe he still lived in town, but I don't know what he's doing.
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:48.000 And so it's kind of a, you know, she'd give me mate, saltine crackers with butter on them, pretty good life. And then what your other, your other, I guess maybe your mom side had a ranch that ranch in Eastern Oregon.
00:33:48.000 --> 00:34:03.000 You went out, worked on that. Yeah, yeah, I did. My grandpa was a horse trainer and super tough. He's, you know, he left home. I think he lied to get in the service in his 15 or 16.
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:24.000 And, you know, was in the military just tough, tough dude. And he got into horses. He did rode yo when he got out of the service and then started training and and breeding horses. So I'd go over there and work and he had he was tough tough guy.
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:38.000 Did you ever do rodeo? No. When I, when I watched that, like, yeah, I don't like to get injured, right? You know, I mean, none of us like to get injured, when you get injured, you know, you feel like it's horrible.
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:52.000 Yeah, like the old world's on a part and I feel like the biggest whim when I get injured because I'm always like, I can't, you know, I've jumped my finger and my grips and I feel like just like, and then you know guys that you know have lost legs and they're driving on.
00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:18.000 But man, when I watched rodeo people, how are they not getting majorly injured every freaking time? The durable damn. Yeah, that and I want to ever watch rugby. Yeah, those guys are tough too. I went watch a rugby game like a year ago and same thing every play. I was shuddering and you know, so, you know, a lot of times you get that feeling when you watch a sport, you like hockey do that.
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:28.000 Yeah, you know, you're like, oh, yeah, I'll do that. If I trained hard, I could get in there. You know, you're, but I was watching this rugby game going, I actually don't want to do that.
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:45.000 I actually do not want to do that. These guys are impact every single time. So you're out there and this is like typical ranch stuff where you're learning the like extra hard work is getting after it. Yeah, yeah, just get up early, get a little horses fed and watered.
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:58.000 I would, because he had race horses. So he bred quarter horses and I would go and warm them up before the races. So it's called a jocky boy. And so I'd get on there.
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:13.000 And to do that, I had to know horses. The horse can tell whether, you know, the person on them knows what the fuck they're doing, especially horses that are all wound up for the races. It's, that was pretty intense, but I like doing it.
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:23.000 How long do it take you to get comfortable on the horses? Was that like your introduction to it that summer? No, I would, I would ride every time I went there.
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:31.000 So you kind of grew up doing it. Yeah. And then when I worked for him, he, I'm trying to think, I think he paid me.
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:51.000 So it seems like it was 100 and for some reason, it's 76 a month, but then I had to pay for all my own stuff. So like food and water. Yeah, and like, I'm, I remember he took me to, to buy clothes like jeans and a cowboy hat and things like this and that came out of 100, 7 years.
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.000 I thought he was hooking me up. Now, Grandpa Bob, you got a different way. No, no, he was, yeah.
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:08.000 So you learn a lot from him and, and I'm a fast forward a little bit. You say I learned something else from Grandpa Bob, I was taught that tomorrow is not guaranteed.
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:16.000 My mom's mother drove her car over from their ranch in eastern Oregon to visit, to visit and go to my homecoming football game on Friday.
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.000 Late Thursday night, the sheriff's department called and told us that Papa had died and an automobile accident.
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:35.000 It was very painful to hear this since Grandpa Bob was a huge part of my teenage years. The following night, the homecoming game was tough to get through, but I had a good game and made some difficult catches.
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000 Papa taught me to give everything you have each day and the only thing that mattered was winning.
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000 When the horse wins, the trainer, the jockey and the family get to take a photo in the winter circle.
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000 Anything less than that is a failure.
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000 Check.
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000 That was, was that your senior year then?
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000 That was junior junior junior year.
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.000 Fast forward a little bit. You graduated earlier. You graduated when you were 17 years old.
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000 And then you get a job at Safeway.
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000 Yeah, I kind of forgot this part of the book, but my, it was weird. My family moved when I was 17.
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000 So they, they were going to go to Arizona and I just said, I'm not going to Arizona.
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000 And so I stayed and they moved. They only stayed there two weeks, but they moved back when I never moved back home.
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:46.000 Wait, what did you get like a place to stay with your buddies or something? No, I stayed with my girlfriend. She was a senior too. So we're kind of kind of sounds odd.
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.000 I mean, right now if I imagine my daughter, like us moving my daughter to senior, I couldn't imagine this.
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000 Hey, good luck. Keep in touch.
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000 Yeah, and by the way, moving with some other high senior.
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000 I know anyway, so I stayed, they moved back and never moved back in and then I ended up getting the job at Safeway.
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:13.000 Cause I wanted to wait my vanilla. He was a year behind me. So I learned I needed, we're going to go to a chart plate called football together.
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000 So I worked for a year in between waiting.
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000 And then you end up getting to Southern Oregon State and you try out for the football team.
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:31.000 You say after I tried, after trying to make the team I read, she ordered for Southern Oregon State, meaning everyday I practiced against the starting defense.
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000 There were definitely some beasts out there on the field. I definitely wasn't one of them.
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000 It was fun, especially since there were some elite athletes on the field who eventually made it to the NFL.
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000 The irony of college was that throughout my high school years, I never drank even one beer.
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:55.000 All I cared about was sports and grades. I knew I wasn't an elite athlete, but I'd still tried my hardest, especially because I wanted to impress my dad.
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.000 What I learned at Southern Oregon was that even though I wasn't good enough to play college football, I knew how to party.
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000 I drank a lot of beer and eventually went back to Eugene with this new mastered skill.
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000 So you didn't drink at all growing up.
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000 And then you get to college.
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.000 It just like the stereotypical friggin, you could just go get it.
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:33.000 Yeah, I mean, you know how if you're on the football team, you can go to any party, you know, always girls always, always, you know, we had this dorm that was asked but haul was just football player.
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:42.000 So there's always girls there. There's like a big open shower and there'd be guys and girls in the shower to say, it's like, I'm like this.
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000 I don't know what heaven is like, but feels like it should be like this.
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000 So anyway, it was, it was a lot different.
00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:02.000 One of my buddies in the Siltians played football at University of Texas and obviously it's like a religion down there and I was like, what was it like, you know, being on the football team down there and he goes,
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000 like a jallie green giant walking the earth.
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000 He said, you literally, he said he literally could do anything he wanted to have.
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:19.000 You know, you know, you know, you know, he could never bought a beer, you know, feels like the seas parted when he showed up. He said it was freaking ridiculous.
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000 So how long did you stay there for?
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000 This year. So one year.
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:30.000 Yeah, one year. But yeah, I mean, so it wasn't like Texas, but for that little, that was the Ashwin Oregon, for that little town.
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000 Yeah, it was kind of a big deal if you're there.
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:34.000 Yeah, it's fun.
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000 It won't made you stop.
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000 What made you decide to not go to college anyway?
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:51.000 I just didn't have money. So nobody's paying. I had financial aid and I was getting money. And so it was about 5,000 a year living down there. And I was a walk on. So I didn't get any scholarship or anything like that.
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000 So I just didn't have money.
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000 Yeah, did you have any vision?
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000 Yeah, because I think a lot of kids just go to college because that's like you're supposed to what it is.
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000 Yeah, it's just like that's like the normal chain of command as you got to get your college degree.
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:15.000 So we tell I tell my kids, Tanner who's in the service. He tried.
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000 That's what my oldest one, but I went through first and you know, told him, no, you're going to go to school.
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000 You're going to get a degree and I could tell.
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000 It's just not happening.
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000 But anyway, I've found it that trap too.
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000 Yeah, no, you go to college.
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000 Yeah, especially you go there for a year and you're like, what am I even doing here?
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000 Yeah, you know, I get in trunk, whatever spending money. Why, why have you been here?
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.000 Yeah, I got decent grades. I mean, I took creative writing. So it's like I always liked writing. So at least I did that.
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:55.000 Yeah, that's an interesting thread that's throughout the book is your, I know obviously this book is sort of the apex of that journey.
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000 But yeah, the fact that you were always kind of into writing.
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:09.000 So you get you leave college, go back, go back home and now you're working.
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000 You're working in a warehouse for $4.72 an hour according to the book.
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:14.000 That's right.
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:23.000 As a working part time, going to go into Lane Community College and, you know, my, my truck, little Toyota tool,
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:30.000 dry was just full of beer cans all the time because we just go up in the woods and build a fire at the rock pit and drink and
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000 That's what I mean, I would go scout deer. I always like taking pictures.
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:43.000 So I go look for bucks and bowls and try to take pictures of them in the mornings, but then I would, you know, drink for the weekends and the afternoon.
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000 Yeah, you say, here, wasn't like I was letting anybody down. Nobody expected anything from Cameron Haynes.
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000 So I didn't expect anything out of myself. No.
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000 Fast forward a little bit.
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:08.000 Thankfully, Roy kept on me and kept encouraging me to bow on telling me it's way better than hunting with a gun.
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:17.000 That there were less people and that I would enjoy it. Roy got me started, but the only way I could build confidence in anything was to go out and do it.
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000 Soon I focused my energy on bow hunting like athletics. It provided a challenge.
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:29.000 I found the perfect thing to work hard at something that challenged me that not everybody was good at when I was successful at bow hunting.
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:38.000 It gave me a lot of confidence for young man having confidence and getting positive reinforcement in anything was a powerful spark for change in my life.
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000 Here's the truth. I'm an average guy who has experienced above average bow hunting success over the past three decades.
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:50.000 One thing is for sure if I can do it anyone can. I came from nothing and had no one pushing me or even believing in me.
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:58.000 For this reason, my story proves that in bow hunting, the most average person can achieve the grandest of dreams.
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000 There's a lot of hell of a lot of hard work in between average person and dreams on that one.
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000 So how did you know Roy? Roy Roth?
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:20.000 He went to a Mohawk. He was a year ahead of me. He was in his wife and my class. He was like the brain of the class. I think she could have got valedictorian maybe.
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000 So that was Jill.
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:35.000 But we didn't hang out because he, I just did the football basketball baseball. He had a trap line and would always be in the woods trapping. He did play football. He's good at football and baseball, but no basketball.
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:44.000 But we didn't really hang out or anything. But he, he was always the guy if I had a hunting question. I'd be like, I'm just, yes, Roy. He's like the best in the school.
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:56.000 And so he, from there, we kind of built a relationship when I was still rifle hunting and then he inspired me to buy a bow and get going down that road.
00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:06.000 You say I run into a lot of people who are new to bow hunting. They get a bow going on in the discover it's just too difficult. So they quit. I understand.
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:16.000 I missed 16 deer the first year I went bow hunting. So I've been there. What if I'd given up after the first year? There's the question once again, what if?
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:30.000 Here's the reason why bow hunting is both exciting and excruciating. It's difficult and frustrating as hell, especially when you're used to hunting with a rifle. People become used to the ritual of seeing an animal in rifle range and then boom, it's over.
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:42.000 It's done. You've made the shot. The animal is dead. With a bow being in bow range doesn't mean anything. Even if the animal is in rifle range, when your bow hunting, the hunt has just started.
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:52.000 Moving from rifle range into bow range means you're moving into the animal's red zone and that ups the challenge immensely and bow hunting. There's no guarantee it's going to work out.
00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:12.000 For me, I never like to fail. I didn't want to be a failure with the bow. So after that first year of killing the spike bow elk, my second season behind the bow, I killed a pope and young three by three black tail, a rag horn five by five bow and a bear with a $200 bow and using $30 binoculars.
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:25.000 I can only afford to hunt an organ instead of traveling anywhere out of the state. I bought three tags and filled three tags. The second year of bow hunting wasn't just memorable for me. It was monumental.
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:50.000 You came out of the gate. Going hard. Yeah, I mean that was a finely found because as you, you know, we've kind of went through this journey. I wasn't good. Really not like a natural at anything is all work and then I got to bow hunting and I'm like, well, I can work hard and then have these.
00:47:50.000 --> 00:48:07.000 What I considered a very, you know, pretty high above average, maybe excellent results and I didn't know anybody killing a bull buck and bear with their bow that was like there's like a we'd lump those all together in one word bull buck bear.
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:17.000 And if you could get that done is your bow. That's freaking bad. Yeah, it wasn't happening. So I felt really getting that was just my second season. So it gave me a lot of confidence.
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:31.000 How many arrows were you shooting in the offices and getting ready for that were you were you kind of obsessed out of the gate? Yeah, yeah, I shot way more than that I do now. Yeah, I mean, I had to shot for hours. Yeah, loved it.
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:44.000 How did you get the feel for like the hunt part the wind was Roy teaching you that stuff? No, that was just, you know,
00:48:44.000 --> 00:49:06.000 I was like, right, for hunting, you don't really need to know that, but I was in the woods a lot, you know, whether I was hunting or going with somebody. So as learning, you kind of hunting is all about, well, not all about there's a lot of different things that you got to read the country, you got to read the animal behavior is a big part of it learning their tendencies and then what you can get away with them.
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:20.000 And I see you and so I would, as I said, you know, I would go out and take pictures a lot too. So I always out trying to get photos and then hunting all the time. So I just was naturally just learning more all these reps all this time in the and the mountains.
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:43.000 So then when it came time for to actually try to kill something, I had a big advantage because I had just been out there at the time spent, you know, and I just felt pretty natural, but I still had to learn about the wind had to learn about when an arrow hits an animal and you're reading the blood trail where that blood's from the injury you've caused the animal.
00:49:43.000 --> 00:50:04.000 You know, how to trail that thing, whether it's hoof marks in soft soil or rocks overturned different things. Furns would be kind of indicate the direction of travel. So you had still had to look a lot of woodsmanship goes in to successful bohani. So I had to learn that that just takes time.
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:11.000 Were you going with anybody? Were you primarily like that first year where you got the bullbuck and bear.
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:18.000 Booze was anyone going with you? My brother went sometimes. I think when I killed that buck, he was there too.
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000 And then the bull, let me think, know the bull eyes by myself, bear by myself.
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:36.000 Yeah, I guess the reason I'm kind of pausing here is like I said me being an amateur hunter and having been guided on hunts by experts.
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:47.000 Or sometimes even multiple sometimes I've gone out with both John W. and a guide with me at the same time. So there's like two people that are experts.
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:59.000 Right. And the amount of information that they're feeding me, the amount of things that are going on during a hunt is there's so much going on.
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:12.000 I mean, the reaction of the animals, the wind, the terrain, like all those things are going on. I've had when I've hunted, I've had people feeding me that information, you know.
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:26.000 And for you to be out there on your second season pulling that off, that's freaking impressive, man. And I don't want, and the other reason I'm kind of like diving into this is because I said, oh, how many arrows did you shoot?
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000 And shoot in the arrows?
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:41.000 Yeah, you've got to be able to shoot the arrows, but there's so much more to it that I didn't want to make it sound like, oh, hey, if I shoot a bunch of arrows, and I can hit that target at it, freaking 60 yards, I'm going to be good to go.
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:56.000 I think hunting is like when you're driving somewhere, and if you're not driving, not really paying attention. You know what I mean? I feel like hunting can be like that too. If you're not making the calls, you can have people telling you, just like you can have somebody drive you down here.
00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:19.000 If somebody's driving, like if I had to repeat how I got to right here to the studio today, I took an Uber, so I don't know. But when you're hunting, when you're making the calls that it might be a rough go, you might fail a lot, but you're also learning more than I think you have some great mentors on the hunt.
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:28.000 But I think it's hard that's a hard situation to learn that firsthand experience also because you're kind of, you're doing what they say. You know what I mean?
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:44.000 So for me, it was, it was hard, but it was a big advantage to learn that on my own, make those mistakes on my own. And it just, I think being by myself so much as a kid, I was fine being by myself.
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:52.000 I was used to being alone my whole life really. So just being out in the woods, that's just, that was an easy transition.
00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:02.000 Now I'm by myself, but I'm doing something. I'm not by myself, you know, staring at the wall, even she does.
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:19.000 Yeah, that's again, just to reiterate the amount that goes in to pulling this off is ridiculously hard. These, this is a freaking challenging, challenging thing to do.
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000 So I just don't want to, don't want to short sell it at all.
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:32.000 Yeah, I mean, there's still hunts now, even after all these years where I'm like, I wonder, I'm like, how have I ever killed anything with an arrow?
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:39.000 I mean, it just seems, it feels impossible on some of these hunts because it's not just getting close.
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:46.000 I mean, that's, you find the animal, that's okay. Now we've started something, at least we've got a target, right?
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:55.000 But then so much has to go right. And then if you're trying to film as you know, I think you know, some of yours has been filmed and other guys are there.
00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:02.000 So it's like there's however much, you know, three guys, three times and always three times a sand, three times a movement.
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.000 It's tough.
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000 There's a lot of shit that can go sideways.
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:18.000 And it does, and so again, what I was, my point was sometimes I wonder myself, I'm like, I don't know how I've ever done this. It feels, feels like it's just not going to happen.
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.000 Well, you've made it happen a lot.
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:28.000 Get into your third season. You say I was invaded by invited by Wayne and Dakota, join him in the country.
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000 He had hunted since he was a young boy, Wayne owned the bull rack.
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000 And I only say it like that because it's kind of like legendary, even though it never even been there.
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:44.000 Yeah. The archery pro shop in Springfield, Oregon opened in 1971. Wayne Roy Roth,
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000 Dwayne Levitt, right?
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:52.000 Jeff Brooks and I ventured toward the legendary Steans Mountain.
00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:02.000 And there, you say this, my shot was perfect.
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:10.000 The arrow went into the last rib and stopped at the far side of the shoulder, meaning I only had one hole, the entrance from which to leave blood.
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:15.000 I was using a thunderhead 125s, which are good tough heads that did the job.
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:21.000 That one perfect arrow put the bull down quickly, even though I had scant blood trail to follow.
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:28.000 The Roosevelt bull was a big-bodied beast though, and is heavy hoofs scarred the soft soil deeply.
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:35.000 I followed his fresh deep-cutting tracks for 50 yards down the hill before pulling back a wet fur bow,
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:40.000 revealing the fallen beast in a tango of fireweed.
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:44.000 This dark antlered 5x5 was my best bull to date.
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.000 I remember every detail of these hunts, like they were yesterday, hence the saying,
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.000 the beast is dead, long live the mighty beast.
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000 Bow hunting had gotten in my soul.
00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:05.000 At that time I had no idea how would it end up directing my every step through the journey of life.
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000 Chuck.
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.000 Despite my growth and success in Bow hunting, I was still going nowhere in my life.
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000 I was 22 to 23 years old.
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000 It's such a good contrast, like you're kicking ass out in the woods.
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:22.000 And yet, 23 years old living with four guys drank beer all the time.
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:27.000 One of my roommates got two DUIs and three weeks, both while driving my truck.
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.000 I was glad I hadn't, I wasn't driving those times, it was just a matter of luck.
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000 More a matter of luck than good decision making.
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000 I just never got caught.
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000 I wasn't living healthfully, and still didn't have a real sense of purpose.
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000 I wasn't accountable for anything or anybody.
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000 I felt shitty all the time.
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000 A wake-up call arrived when I crashed my truck one night while driving drunk.
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000 I was driving too fast and flipped the vehicle, rolling it.
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000 The roof was crushed all the way down to the top of the seat.
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000 The truck was totaled.
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000 Of course, I didn't remember a thing.
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000 Damn, just straight black out driving.
00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000 Yeah.
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000 I could have easily died or killed someone.
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000 Did I wake up?
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000 No, not yet.
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000 Did I see some connection between me walking away from the crash.
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.000 And my dad walking away from his was I following in his alcoholic footsteps.
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000 My life would become a living living with a bunch of guys just partying,
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000 basically working during the week going to clubs and weekends, just drinking at the apartment
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000 or on the lake.
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000 It was a great life.
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:28.000 Yeah, I would usually on the weekends.
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000 I would get up and go.
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.000 We lived on the second floor of the Chase Village apartments,
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.000 and I'd go out and look and see if my truck was there.
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000 And I had driven my truck.
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000 And I'd have to go see.
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000 So if the truck was there, I'd go back in.
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000 I'd be like, where's my truck?
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.000 You remember you left to the Scandia days or whatever.
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000 They had all the likes.
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000 No, damn.
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000 So just, you know, just being an idiot.
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000 Yeah.
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.000 You say the same year, I killed my first bill in 1989.
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000 I wrote my first hunting article.
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.000 I was going to go to the Bulls, Bughals, and Baches for Western Bow Hunter.
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000 So you're getting a writing pretty quickly out of the gate with this.
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000 It's cool in the book.
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000 You got a bunch of the articles.
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.000 Cliped out.
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:24.000 So you're on this kind of, well, I'll use your word.
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000 Luser, path.
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000 Yeah.
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000 I wouldn't say that, but you got into the book.
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000 You say being a loser isn't cool.
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000 And not being a loser, Dad.
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.000 When Tanner, our first son, was born in 1993, something inside of me switched.
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.000 They say, parenthood changes everything, and it did for me.
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000 Suddenly, I wasn't just on my own.
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000 Now I was affecting other people's lives.
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.000 I got to be an example.
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000 Alcohol was poison.
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.000 I had seen what alcohol did to my dad, ruining what he could have been.
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000 Something incredible.
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.000 And I was seeing it do the same thing to me.
00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000 Sorry, stop drinking.
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000 Alcohol wasn't going to help me in any area of my life.
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000 Especially with my hunting.
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:07.000 I'm not judging anybody else, but for me, I had to quit drinking.
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:15.000 So Tanner, coming along is really the seems like from the book, it's the catalyst for
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000 real change in your life.
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000 Yeah.
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:25.000 I mean, people always say, and maybe it's true for them, but they say, well, you know, I don't
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:30.000 know that there's this thing, like if your father's an alcoholic, then you have a greater
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.000 chance being an alcoholic and like this keeps this whole thing going, right?
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.000 And then people learn from it, this and that, and it all sounds good.
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000 I didn't really, I knew all that.
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.000 I didn't really care.
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:51.000 Even when Tanner was born, I felt different, and I was like, okay, this isn't just me being a 20
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:55.000 summer-year-old guy, just going to the club.
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000 That's what it feels like everybody does.
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:04.000 But then with the kid, but then still, I was like, well, I should, I probably shouldn't be a
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000 dipshit like this, but I still was.
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:13.000 I still, I'm not drink for a little while, and I, you know, whatever, go back out.
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.000 You know, Tanner was around, so my wife, we were just in our 20s, you know, mid 20s.
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000 And I wasn't, I was still doing stupid shit.
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000 And so it wasn't just like, right when he was born, it still took a while.
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000 Right?
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000 And I still was still fucked up.
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000 You know, I mean, I would still drink and drive, I remember leaving the Oregon football game.
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000 I'd drive in over all the cones and this cop jumped out, told me to pull over.
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000 And I was just, why am I driving over the cones?
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000 I don't know.
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000 It's half time drinking for the, for the whole game.
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.000 And I had to do a walking test, like, a DUI test there with everybody leaving the Oregon football
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000 game, you know, and somehow I passed.
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.000 I have no idea how, but I never got a DUI, but the point is, it's like, it still took a
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000 little bit.
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000 It wasn't just a light switch.
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000 I still, you know, I hadn't run around a marathon yet, so I hadn't really tapped
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000 into like dedication.
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000 I was having success with the bow.
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000 I was having a little thing.
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000 I still didn't have a great job.
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000 What was your job at this time?
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000 I was still in that warehouse.
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000 I worked at that warehouse.
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000 I was part time in the Northwest School, and I got full time.
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000 And guys would kind of listen to me, so they made me a lead.
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000 And I worked there for nine years.
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:44.000 And then by kind of by the end of that nine years, I was starting to figure things out a
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000 little bit.
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000 And I got this job, same job I have right now at Springfield, Utility Board.
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000 And it's like, you know, like we're here in San Diego, San Diego, Water and Power, whatever
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000 it's called, it's always a good, good job.
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.000 And for me, for somebody like me, a job at a, I mean, just a
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000 utility, it's about as good as it's going to get.
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000 Right?
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000 People are always going to need water and power.
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000 I mean, have a paycheck, good benefits.
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000 Like, okay, this is kind of total stability.
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000 Yeah, yeah.
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000 And I could provide for my family.
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000 I still felt like a kid, but I'm like, kind of supposed to have all these, you know, these
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000 pay all these bills and have cars and have this house and do all this, but I didn't feel like.
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000 I, I don't know, it just felt like still like a lot for me.
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000 And so I, I ended up getting the job on the construction crew at the Springfield Utility Board.
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000 Yeah, so I started there at like $7 an hour.
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000 I'd moved up at the warehouse.
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000 I was, they promoted me to supervisors the same day.
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000 I gave my notice and quit because I got hired at the utility, but so I was making like 13
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000 there and then I had to go back down to seven to start at the, at the utility board.
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000 But yeah, so just trying to get it figured out.
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000 Yeah.
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000 Back to the hunting a little bit.
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000 You see in the book, it's been said that life offers two paths, one easy and one hard.
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000 As Roy and I entered the unforgiving sanctuary of the Eagle Cap wilderness for the first time in
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000 witness the awe inspiring.
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000 While Lawa, how do you say that?
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000 Well, Lawa mountains in northeast Oregon.
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000 It was obvious that we had chosen the latter.
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000 We were always drawn toward the more difficult path to us.
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000 The longer was always better.
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000 You see, talking about Roy a little bit here.
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000 Both hunting in general is hard.
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000 There are lots of tough men who do it, but it's not easy.
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000 The mountains can break even the toughest man.
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000 Roy, rough as the toughest human I ever met and ever seen out in the mountains.
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000 Hands down Roy was the toughest bow hunter I'd ever seen and he always carried the best attitude.
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000 I learned so much from him.
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000 He is a big part of the reason I am the person I am today.
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000 As a kid, I always knew Roy was good in the woods.
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000 He could always get the best fishing holes before the rest of us.
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:12.000 We nicknamed him Gazelle Roy because he was big, but moved like a gazelle.
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000 He was a great athlete.
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000 He played football and he was really good at baseball playing third baseman.
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000 From the moment Roy told me I should start bow hunting, we connected and hit it off.
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:26.000 From then on, we started hunting together and we just clicked because we had no limits on how much misery
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000 we could suffer to chase success.
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000 You guys rolled out into this mountain wilderness area.
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:47.000 You encounter another hunter who tells you guys about this spot where Billy Cruz used to go.
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000 What's the legend of Billy Cruz?
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000 Billy Cruz was just a badass.
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000 He started Oregon bow company, which was the bow I shot at that time.
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000 In junction city back there in Oregon.
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000 I actually didn't know Billy Cruz.
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000 I knew of him and it seemed as a picture as well.
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000 This dentist that was in the wilderness.
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:14.000 He said, we came from this trailhead way back here, something like 20 miles away.
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000 I said we just want to get away from people.
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000 He was like, oh, okay, he goes well.
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000 I can send you to a place and nobody goes.
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000 He goes, it's two rugged for horses, two steep for men, all this stuff.
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000 He goes the only person that ever goes there is Billy Cruz.
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000 That sounds good.
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000 You and Roy are like, yeah, it was awesome.
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:45.000 That was, but also I kind of, I did learn something from that too because what I learned at that time
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.000 has been proven over and over again is rugged country like that.
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:59.000 If men who spend a lot of time in it die often, it's just part of the the mountains are so unforgiving
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000 and Billy Cruz died back there.
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.000 And he died in a plane crash, but it's like if while he's scouting elk in those mountains.
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000 And I just, it just gets proven over and over again.
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.000 People go in the get a taste of the mountains they come back, but the longer you spend there the more you're kind of,
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000 you know, you're just playing the rock and roll on the dice.
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.000 But in the meantime, we did go there and I ended up hunting back in that same country for many years,
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.000 Roy moved to Alaska after that first season, but yeah, it was amazing.
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000 We never saw anybody back there.
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000 Super rugged.
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000 This is kind of cool.
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000 You say, you know, one of your favorite books of all time is hunting with the bow and arrow by Dr.
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000 Sachs and Pope written in 1923.
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000 And you call out a couple of parts on page 181 it reads,
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000 we also began preparing ourselves for the contest.
01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.000 Although habitually in good physical condition, we undertook special training for the big event.
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000 In this case, he and young were preparing for a grizzly bow hunt, Pope continues.
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000 By running, the use of dumbbells and other gymnastic practices,
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000 we strengthened our muscles and increased our endurance.
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000 Regarding the backcountry hunt, he writes,
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000 we were there to win and nothing else matter mattered.
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000 Adding later, we were trained down to the raw hide and sinu,
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000 keyed to alertness and ready for any emergency.
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.000 Seems like that could be like the root of you saying,
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000 hey, I can get them freaking better shape for this shit.
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000 Yeah, I mean, there's 100 years ago.
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000 And those guys knew that at that time that,
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:49.000 hey, we need to be out our best to be in these mountains and get animals killed with an arrow.
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000 100 years ago, these guys are freaking training training.
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000 Yeah.
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000 Did you like make that connection?
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000 No.
01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:04.000 No, because when I started training, so hunting the hunter community is steeped in tradition,
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000 obviously, the tradition isn't guys like Saxon, Pope and Art Young.
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.000 It's guys that like maybe my stepdad who they're just getting away,
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000 going to deer camp.
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000 We're not training for this.
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000 This is kind of a vacation.
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000 So when I first got into it, I started doing this running and doing this thing.
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000 I need to be a little better.
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000 I got a lot of pushback from the hunting community itself.
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000 And I said, you know, you don't need to run a marathon to kill an elk,
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000 but I know this guy and that guy and they kill animals all the time,
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000 and they're overweight.
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000 And Roy was actually over, you know, he's a big dude overweight.
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000 But the difference is he was just so much tougher and better than most guys.
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000 So they would, but they'd use that as an example of why you don't need to be in shape.
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000 And I'd be like, well, okay, you're not Roy.
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000 First of all.
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.000 And but I got for years pushback and still probably still do.
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000 I just don't pay attention to him.
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000 But people hunters just don't want to, because it kind of puts the owner's back on them.
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000 Like, God, do I have to take this shit more serious?
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000 What do I got to do here?
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000 Ah.
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:21.000 So like you said, Roy moves to Alaska.
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:28.000 And you go, it's pretty, not funny, it's not the word, but you can't find anybody else really to hunt with.
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000 No.
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000 He must have been one of those bastards just like strong and can just carry his weight.
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000 It's no factor.
01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000 No, he, I mean, there's a, I can't remember if I talk about it in there,
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000 but one time we're on Prince of Wales Island.
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000 Here's his attitude wrapped up.
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000 To hunt Prince of Wales for Black Bear, you need a boat.
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000 It's all on the island chain.
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000 You got to go to open water sometimes.
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000 There's tides coming in and out.
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000 So there's, there's, the water is pretty dangerous out there.
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000 But we had boat motor problems.
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000 And without a boat, the motor running right out there,
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000 it was not only dangerous, but you couldn't get anywhere.
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.000 So he's like, I'm going to take this motor off and go into town,
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000 Craig, Alaska, which is there in South East Alaska.
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000 And but it's about 15 miles on the water.
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000 And he had this little like 10 or 12 foot raft that he had to put a piece of plywood on,
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000 put the motor on and kind of lay down and kind of hold the front of it because to get on
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000 step that it was coming up, you know.
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000 And so he would have to lay and he did 15 miles all the way in there on a Sunday,
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000 bought this new motor for 4,000 bucks.
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000 And it's all the way, I don't know, he got her right on actually a big ship.
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000 And I could see him.
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000 I was seeing him coming the next day and I'm like, look, I think I see Roy on there
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000 and they're like toeing this little raft.
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000 Just tied to a rope behind it.
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.000 And I'm like, so anyway, it was what, and he did this at midnight.
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000 He took off.
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000 He's like, well, no, this is what we got to do.
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000 Just buy himself by himself.
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000 And when he bought this, you know, 4,000 dollar motor,
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000 brought it back out, we're back in business, killing bear.
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000 But that, that whatever it took,
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000 that's the attitude right there, hey, oh, this isn't working.
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000 Here's what we got to do, whatever it takes to make this happen.
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000 Most people aren't like that.
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000 Yeah, no, that's, that's next level.
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000 Yeah.
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000 You say then, after he moves to Alaska for the next 12 years,
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000 I ended up hunting in the sprawling, unforgiven eagle cap wilderness,
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000 most of the time on my own.
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000 My entire existence seemingly revolved around preparing for just one crack at the wilderness,
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000 bulls and bucks where Billy cruised it walked.
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:48.000 I learned more about myself on those solo haunts than I could have in a lifetime in the everyday world.
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000 One of the things you've learned, you talk about, are you willing to bleed?
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000 In most cases, it takes some blood to achieve your goals.
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000 The farther you go, the fewer who will be able to go,
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000 or we willing to go with you.
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000 I knew that if I could get back farther into the wilderness,
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000 I could find better hunting.
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000 I could get away from other hunters if I wasn't better shape.
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000 And if I was mentally stronger, I could outlast anyone.
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000 This is sort of like this.
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000 It's really cool to read the book and there's so many good details in here
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000 to see your evolution as you're in.
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000 Kind of pioneering this attitude of like,
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.000 oh, I can just outwork and go further and I'll end up being alone out there.
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000 Yeah.
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000 And that's what I want.
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000 That's, that was the only way I could up my odds.
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000 Now, we get to go hunt some great country.
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000 Money can get you that opportunity,
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000 or knowing the right people can get you that opportunity.
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000 So that ups your eyes a little bit.
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000 You're still very hard.
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000 You know, as you know, still very hard.
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000 But you'll earn opportunity.
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000 But for me at that time, the only way to earn opportunity
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000 was, I had no advantage.
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000 I had no money advantage.
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000 All people in the regular society, they're smarter, more money, more connections,
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000 more whatever.
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000 I always down at the bottom.
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000 In the mountains, I'm like, okay, I call the shots back here now.
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000 All those advantages you have on the outside, don't mean shit back here.
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000 Now, if I'm in better shape than you and I know this country better,
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000 and I'm willing to work harder than you,
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000 this is, this is my country.
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000 This is, I call the shots.
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000 This is my domain.
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000 I'm laughing and smiling over here because all the money in the world
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000 isn't going to carry your ass up that freaking hill.
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000 No, that's it.
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000 And that's the first time I ever felt like, you know,
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000 because I hadn't felt like shit my whole life, you know,
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:50.000 as far as, I don't know what, where I stood and I guess a ladder of success.
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000 And now, of a sudden, I'm like, what are you second?
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000 This is different.
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000 It felt different.
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000 The challenge for me at that time was,
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000 I was trying not to be, I was selfish because it's,
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000 I mean, I found something that, like, for me was good,
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000 but now I had family home, so I'd be back there all the time
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000 and I'd be like, should I be back away from my family?
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000 Because it wasn't like a job.
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.000 And were you making any kind of connection towards what it could turn into?
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000 No, just a reason to just meet.
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000 No, I was just, you know, this is just what I wanted to do.
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000 So it was like a selfish thing.
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000 Because people can justify all the time,
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000 well, I gotta do this for work.
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000 So I gotta travel for work.
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000 And it's like, it gives us, it's easy to say,
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000 well, you know, people have to do that.
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000 We're providing it for the family.
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000 Something like that.
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000 I'm gonna sell an article for 50 bucks
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000 and be away from my family for 10 days.
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000 That doesn't pencil out.
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000 But it's just like, I felt like that's what I needed to do.
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000 Because when I wasn't doing that, I was at home.
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000 I was miserable.
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000 Then I felt like maybe I wanted to go drinking
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000 or maybe how am I getting this, you know,
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000 a buzz, I guess.
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.000 But I used to get home from work at like six o'clock.
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000 Maybe seven o'clock at night.
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000 Walking, put my work bag down, pick up my jitzie bag
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000 and go to jitzie for two hours.
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000 And I did that every night.
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000 I did that every night.
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000 And I remember sometimes where my wife would be looking at me
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:31.000 with just like a combination of anger
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000 and lack of understanding, like,
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000 like, like, what, like, what are you serious right now?
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000 Like, this is what you're doing.
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000 You got three kids and you're home for nine minutes
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000 and you're gonna leave.
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000 And I did that every night.
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000 And you know, when I, when,
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000 what was interesting was my wife eventually realized
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000 that if I didn't do that,
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000 I had, I would, I would be,
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000 I would be, I wouldn't be happy.
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000 I would be like, like, not, not have a good attitude
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000 about stuff, right?
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000 Because I felt like that was what I needed to do.
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000 And yeah, there's, I unfortunately,
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000 I never really thought about it as being selfish
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000 until you just said that right now.
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000 I guess I realized that even at the time,
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000 but I always kind of
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000 kind of rationalize this thing where I'd kind of related
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000 to my regular job, I'd say, well, hey, you know,
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000 I need to be able to do this in case I'd end up
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000 on a situation where I gotta use this stuff in combat
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000 and I'd be kind of my rationalization.
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000 I'd even try and rationalize that to my wife sometimes,
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000 but my wife, not an idiot, and she'd be like,
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000 hey, listen, you got freaking a rifle, a pistol,
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000 and two knives, and you think you're gonna have to choke
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000 a person I don't even know about.
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000 Yeah.
01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000 So, yeah, I think it is, you know,
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:06.000 you have some, some, like, primordial urges
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000 as a human, you know, to fight or to hunt.
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000 Like, it seems like it's almost caveman brain.
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000 For me, it got really focused on fighting.
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000 For you, it got really focused on hunting.
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.000 Both those are total primal instincts to have, you know?
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000 So, here's an example.
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000 You got the book of how you're living your life.
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000 On Friday afternoon, I leave work around 4pm,
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000 driving through the North Portland, through North Portland,
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000 arriving at 1 a.m. at my Eagle Cap Trailhead.
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000 I'd load up my pack and start walking.
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000 Try to get 12 miles or so in by first light,
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000 once sleep, get back in there by first light Saturday morning,
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000 be able to hunt or scout until Sunday,
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000 then I would hike out and drive home Sunday night.
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000 Being back at work on Monday morning,
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000 two nights, no sleep, two days,
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000 it's scouting or hunting.
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000 If it was the season, it was worth it.
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000 These trips gave me the confidence to do my long,
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000 so LeHonsh I was testing myself, passing each test.
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000 What caught me, what caught me on that one was like,
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000 this isn't even hunting season.
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000 This is you're just going out there to scout
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000 and get to know the terrain.
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000 Yeah, so it's your wife's piss.
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000 Right, I mean, and I, so it kind of is frustrating
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000 in a little bit, and at that time,
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000 I wasn't like, oh, I'm going to prove all these people wrong.
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000 I mean, kind of I was proving people wrong.
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000 I felt like, but it was more like I just felt like I would
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000 need it to do that, or I wanted to do that,
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000 maybe to be selfish.
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000 But now people see like, where you are now,
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000 you're going to be on your right of book, or you're teaching
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000 leadership, and there's like people see everything,
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000 like you get a lot of attention, because now you're somebody.
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000 But it was the dues you paid going to every night you'd go
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000 to training after work, or if I'd do that.
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000 The reason why you get to here is because you had all that
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000 sacrifice, you made all those sacrifices for time
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000 and for work, and it's like, I wanted to ask those people,
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000 what the fuck are you doing?
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000 What your word? I mean, what were of you sacrificed?
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000 Yeah, of course, that's easy to be invious of this.
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000 When you're like, oh, you got this,
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000 me followers in your sponsor to hear this, and that's like,
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000 yeah, that's what about all the grind.
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000 And the grind where I would be back there,
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000 and I'd be like, I shouldn't be back here.
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000 And I should be at home, I should be being a dad,
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000 and I should be this or that, and I'd be like, well,
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000 you can, and you kind of alluded to it,
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000 you can justify almost anything.
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000 And I'd be like, well, no, I'm not going to be happy
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000 if I'm back here, and I'll be a better dad when I get home,
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000 and I'll be, you know, I'm showing my kids,
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000 and when I got a little older, I'd be like, well,
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000 I'm showing my, I'm an example for my kids
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000 and showing them what hard work can lead to.
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000 I 100% use that.
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000 I want 100%.
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:58.000 I matter of fact, I told, I, I, I would tell like other seals,
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000 you know, if they would say, get worried about, hey,
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000 you know, I'm going on to pull him in again.
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000 I'd say, listen, man, guys have been going on
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000 to employment for thousands of years
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000 and leaving their kids at home.
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000 And that's the example that the kids see.
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000 You know, that the dad's going on the employment.
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000 By the way, when you went on to employment,
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.000 back in freaking, whatever, a 500 years ago,
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000 your deployment was seven years long.
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000 Right. You're the employment was five years,
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000 you're even World War II.
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:29.000 In World War II, you went, you left for war in 1941
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000 or 1942, and you came home when it was over.
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000 Yeah.
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000 That's some commitment.
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000 Yeah.
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000 So, because guys were, the reason that this would get brought up
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000 was guys would get worried about primarily
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000 be worried about like their sons.
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000 Hey, you know, I feel like, you know, I'm leaving my son too much.
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000 I said, hey, the moms have been raising young warriors
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000 for thousands of years.
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000 Right.
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000 You don't need to worry about that.
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000 They're, they're going to look at you and think,
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000 hey, this is what, this is what I'm supposed to do.
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000 Yeah.
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000 So they'll figure it out.
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.000 That sometimes that justification would kind of turn into
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000 civilization for be traded.
01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000 You want a Thursday night after I'd been free to trade it all week or
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000 whatever.
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000 And the dads have to be gone for the moms to be able to use
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000 a way to your dad gets home.
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000 True.
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000 That's how they raise those warriors.
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:26.000 Speaking of all this, I'm a worker.
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000 The truth is, I've always worked really hard because I've never
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000 really felt like I had a ton of natural skills or talent.
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000 It would feel unnatural for me not to have a regular job.
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000 I feel like such a life is reserved for someone who's a star.
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000 And I don't think I got that.
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000 So I grind it out.
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.000 I grind it out at training and I grind it out at work.
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000 Not taking a day off as my only edge.
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000 I can't just say, you know, today I'm going to run.
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000 I've sacrificed enough.
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000 No.
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000 That's what everybody does.
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000 Everybody has an excuse.
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000 Everybody has a reason.
01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000 You can always come up with a reason not to go after a challenge.
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000 So I've learned to never care what the excuse is.
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000 It's never valid.
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000 That's my attitude.
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000 And that's my edge.
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000 It's how I've built endurance and foster resiliency.
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000 There are no rest days in my schedule.
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000 And that's is the reason I excel.
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000 I think it's like no factor.
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000 No factor.
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000 Well, people say like, oh, you take rest days.
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000 I'm like, life gives you rest days.
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000 Yeah.
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000 You know, you get the freaking broken water.
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000 Heeter and all of a sudden you're dealing with that.
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000 Or you know, you get a travel day where it's like, hey,
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.000 I'm going to be traveling at whatever time and then the plane
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000 lays over in your near port for four hours in your layover and like,
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000 okay, life is going to give you rest days.
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000 Right.
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000 I don't take them voluntarily.
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000 Right.
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000 Not happening.
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000 Well, I have a hard time.
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000 Like even yesterday, you know,
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:55.000 Rihanna went out and Evan was out skydiving and Andy was out there too.
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000 And I was, I paid to actually go and I'm like,
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000 I actually want to go and run.
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000 So I did 14 miles here and went up to the top of the hill over here,
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:11.000 ran along the beach and just would rather work instead of skydiving.
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000 So I don't know.
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000 Maybe I missed out on something, but it's, I just don't,
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000 I feel better.
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000 I don't know.
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000 I just don't feel good unless I've sacrificed.
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000 You know, sweated, worked.
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000 So I can go to bed at night and be like, well,
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000 got it done today.
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000 Yeah, we just had a guy on the podcast named Andrew Huberman and he's a
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000 neuroscientist.
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000 Oh, I love him.
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000 Yeah.
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000 He's a stud.
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000 But he, one of the things that he was one of the points he was making is that
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000 free dopamine.
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000 Dopeamine that you don't earn is like the worst thing in the world.
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000 So dopamine that you get from your, from your phone.
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000 Yeah.
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000 Dopamine that you get from a chocolate chip cookie.
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.000 Dopamine that you get that you didn't have to earn is like the worst thing in the world.
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000 And that's probably what you feel.
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000 Is you probably feel like if you don't earn that dopamine,
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000 it doesn't feel right.
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000 Yeah, I mean,
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.000 and people always say over train or you've heard all the sleep.
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000 Saying people love talking about or getting enough sleep.
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000 And I don't know.
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000 I just, I just don't, I don't care about any of that.
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000 I mean, I'm going to train every day.
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000 I'm probably not going to get enough sleep.
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000 But it's like that, that is the only edge.
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000 Yeah, just to to sacrifice more.
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000 Yeah.
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000 It's the only reason why anybody knows who I am.
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000 Hard work.
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.000 By the way, this whole time you're writing for for bow hunting magazines,
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000 local magazines, you get rejected.
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000 You get rejected by bow hunter magazine.
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.000 You write about that there, which is, I mean, that's what happens, right?
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000 Yeah.
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000 That's what happens.
01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.000 Then you say, I decided to write my first book, bow hunting trophy blacktail.
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000 There was never any grand plan one day.
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000 I decided I wanted to write a book and I wanted to be badass.
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000 Hard back full cover.
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:14.000 So you do that.
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000 And you have to borrow a bunch of money to get the thing published.
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000 Yeah.
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000 It's like 50 grand.
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000 Yeah, it was 50,000.
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.000 No, because the book was like over $10 each because it was full color,
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000 full glossy paper.
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000 I didn't know anything about anything.
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.000 So made 5,000 of them, 50,000 bucks.
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000 I had like maybe $200 of it.
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:46.000 So I borrowed, I think, 15,000 from my grandma, 10,000 from my other,
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000 from my in-laws, my mom, I think, 15.
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000 Anyway, what year was that?
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000 That was 99.
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000 So like the internet has been around yet.
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000 You can't even sell this thing on the internet, really.
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000 No, no.
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000 You need to have a magazine.
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000 How long were those freaking boxes of books sitting around the house for four years?
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.000 I mean, we moved them a couple times.
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000 I had a whole spare bedroom filled.
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000 Because it's at 5,000 books and they're at heavy too.
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000 Yeah, that is not fun.
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.000 No, and it took, you know, I and your wife's like, dude, I know.
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000 You spent 50 grand.
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000 Now we got one less room in our house.
01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000 I know.
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000 It was like, it was not pencil and out of this is a business plan.
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000 Hey, what's your business plan?
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000 I never did that one time.
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000 Until they said, well, here's what you owe us.
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000 So I'm like, no, I'm writing a book.
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000 I don't, I will self-publish it because nobody said the market's not big enough.
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000 Because it's just blacktailed deer, which is just on the west coast.
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000 Okay, we're gonna wash and California and BC.
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000 And so yeah, it took forever just to even make that money back.
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000 But I paid everybody back.
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000 Took a while.
01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000 Where'd you sell the books for?
01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000 I think like 20 bucks?
01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000 I think 25.
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000 Okay.
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000 Yeah.
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000 And then five shipping. So it was like maybe 29.95.
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000 That's everything.
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000 Yeah.
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000 Packing them up yourself.
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000 Yeah.
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000 How and yeah.
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000 Yeah.
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000 It was a, yeah.
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000 One thing that's awesome about this story, though, is I mean, your story your life is that you two,
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000 it just took something that you love to do.
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000 And just for all in.
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000 Like that's what that's what you're doing.
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000 Yeah.
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000 And that's, I mean, I don't, I don't know.
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000 I don't know how it's worked like this, but it's just been my journey.
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000 But like I've never been like, why want to meet Tiger Woods?
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000 So I'm going to try to golf.
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000 You know what I mean?
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000 It's like everything I've done.
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000 I've met a lot of amazing people.
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000 Only through what I do.
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000 It's never been like just to meet these.
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000 So I've been able to train with the limpians and do all this thing.
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000 Just because it's like, no, they're helping.
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000 You know, I care about this to build endurance.
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:57.000 So I'm going to run with the Olympian to see what I can learn from them or to train with these,
01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:04.000 these biggest badasses or to lift weights with these studs, you know, Mark Bell.
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000 I can have those chances to interact just through my thing.
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000 I'm not, I haven't changed anything that I do.
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000 It's just what I do.
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:19.000 But it's staying true to, I'm a bow hunter on my Instagram bio just says bow hunter.
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000 And because of that, I've met, I'm sitting here with you guys.
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000 I'm in a, how incredible is that?
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000 I mean, it just is seem real.
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000 That's what I think is the same thing over here.
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000 Probably, this is free.
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000 You did, and eventually you got in a bow hunter.
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000 And you first, your first thing that you wrote,
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000 this is in 2009 was called bleed.
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000 Yeah. Hell yeah.
01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000 Now we get into this little section of life.
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000 I'm going to fast forward.
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000 I started running just for the test to push myself up to 2000.
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:58.000 Most I'd ever run was a 10k, then one time I entered a 7.3 mile race in Salem, Oregon.
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000 And guys thought I was crazy for running that far just to get in shape to hunt.
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000 The black tail woods around home.
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:11.000 Then around a half marathon, then in 2003, I ran my first marathon and finished third overall.
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000 Your first marathon, you finished third overall.
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000 That's freaking legit.
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000 This was about the time I really began to notice that my physical condition could pay.
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000 A huge impact, counting in the woods.
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000 This was where I could improve my game.
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000 Hmm.
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000 And it wasn't like that was a Boston marathon I got third in.
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.000 It was like a pretty small marathon in the Gorge.
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:40.000 So it's from the Dallas to Hood River, but I did get third still.
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000 Yeah.
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000 Hell yeah.
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.000 Since that first marathon, I've completed in Ultra Marathons, winning Peek Shaped.
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000 I just prior to BoC's and I run at least 20 miles a day.
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000 I've ramped it up in effort to gain not only physical up mental strength,
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:59.000 and it's paid off in many years of consistent success.
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:04.000 You could do the big horn trail run.
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:09.000 That's your first Ultra, which Ultra is anything over 26.2.
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000 Yeah.
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:17.000 You got this for your yeah, even right in your whole life kind of as it shows in this book.
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000 Awesome stories.
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000 You say I led the race until mile 24 or 25.
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.000 The problem was the race didn't end at mile 24 or 25.
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000 Yeah.
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000 32 mile.
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:33.000 I finished second overall with a time of four hours and 53 seconds.
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000 It was a great day to be alive.
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000 Almost all the races I run at some time or another.
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000 I want to stop and throw in the towel similarly on many tough horns.
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000 I want to quit and go home to the good life.
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000 So why don't I quit?
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000 What resides in me to keep going?
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000 Maybe it's because I don't want to let people down because I'm a regular guy coming
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:56.000 from a small, a regular small town who dare to dream big about being special and finding some success in life.
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000 Maybe I've always felt like proving people wrong.
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:03.000 As I started running marathons, I realized the connection between endurance racing and hunting.
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000 Because in both disciplines, you're facing huge barriers that make you want to quit.
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000 No one's going to judge if you quit a hunt.
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000 Most people would fail on a hunt.
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000 The same goes for an ultra marathon.
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000 Not many could call you a failure if you didn't last to the finish of a long ultra.
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000 Because most people, you know likely, wouldn't even tow the starting line.
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:28.000 But to me, failure feels like all those people who've doubted me over the years were right.
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:33.000 I can't have that.
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:40.000 And now you've got the full on connection between the better shape I'm in, the better I can hunt.
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:49.000 Yeah, it's, I just, I mean, I noticed that I was just at, I had a big advantage over people.
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.000 I could see people get fatigued if I was with somebody.
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000 I could just, it was just different.
01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:01.000 And I'm like, I learned that if the hardest thing you've ever done is that hunt, that's bad.
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000 It's not good. You're going to, because you're going to, you'll fuck up so much.
01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000 You have to be on such, I mean, precision and making good decisions.
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000 It's, you have to be at your very best.
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:17.000 So if you're fatigued or if you're thinking about home or of all these different things,
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000 it's taken away from where your focus should be, you will fail.
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:28.000 And I just, I noticed that, or I realized I need to be at my very best, even at the end of a long hunt.
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:33.000 And how it made sense to me was that at the end of a long hunt, instead of being diminished,
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000 you should be better because you're getting more dialed into the mountains.
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000 You're understanding the animals and their habits.
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000 You're getting more mountain tough.
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:49.000 And so if you weren't fatigued or have any of those things with, with, with time that comes in the mountains,
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000 like the, where's on people? If that wasn't wearing on you?
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000 By the end of the hunt, you're going to be at your very best.
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.000 And I killed a lot of animals at the very end of the hunt.
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:07.000 So, at one point, the Oregonian newspaper ran an article,
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000 and the headline reads,
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.000 Bo Hunter beats Armstrong.
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000 Yeah, tell us that story.
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000 It's in the book, but give us a, give us a background on that one.
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:23.000 Yeah, I mean, I knew so Lance was retiring from the Tour de France,
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000 and he had won seven straight.
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.000 It's that next year was, let me think.
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000 I think that was in 2006. He ran the New York marathon.
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000 And I'd been a big, big, Lance fan.
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:41.000 You know, this is what, before all the, whatever people want to say about PDs and all that.
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000 It's before all that. So he was just like had overcome this,
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000 and he was like a hero. He's still somebody I look up to,
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000 because he was the best, the very best of what he did.
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000 So he's running this marathon, the New York marathon,
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000 and it's my first year running it.
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000 It's kind of hard to get into. It's a big race.
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.000 And so I thought, well, I want to try to be the greatest endurance athlete of all time.
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000 And so I ended up, I beat him there.
01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.000 It was in 2006, and then we ran together, actually,
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.000 for half the race in Boston in 2008, and I beat him there, too.
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:20.000 Of course, it was like a one person, he didn't even know who I was.
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000 So it wasn't like this is Kim Verselands head to head.
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000 He was, you know, he is a superstar.
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000 I was just something dude.
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000 You know, it's like if LeBron James goes to open gym and somebody,
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000 you know, somehow travels and gets some hook shot to go in.
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000 They dominate in LeBron.
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000 So it's kind of like that. He didn't know.
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000 It's like beating someone at open mat,
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000 or you're like someone passes your guard, open mat,
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000 they're like, hey, you know, I crush chocolate past this car.
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000 Yeah, I even know that we were, you know,
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000 all of us have to have fun with Roman.
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000 Right. So it, so I always the guy who passed your guard.
01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.000 It lands with you.
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000 And it somehow it makes the cover of the Oregon.
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000 I know, your jockels guard gets past my phone.
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000 Exactly.
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:11.000 It was so unjustified, but it's, I just, all I cared about was there
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000 is that it just referred to me as bow hunter.
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000 Yeah, that's badass.
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.000 But it reminds me of, you know, and everybody, everybody loves
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000 a movie 300, but you remember what he was like,
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000 we know what's your professional,
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000 it's your professional, it's such a great part.
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000 And then so I don't have a, that's what I do is bow hunter.
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000 No, did you talk to him during those two races?
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000 Didn't one of you ran with him for a while?
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000 Yeah, you were like talking, right?
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000 Right. Yeah, yeah.
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000 Who knows if he'll remember?
01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000 I think we did sit in a book though.
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000 But, but, oh, I was going to say, sir,
01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000 you're not connected now.
01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000 So, so, to do his podcast.
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000 Okay, well, we've never talked about this.
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000 Yeah.
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000 Like me, he and I, but he's gonna make
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000 I let you win.
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000 I don't know, he'll be like, what?
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000 I don't know who you are.
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000 But what I remember, this could be a version.
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000 You know how you can, you tell us something,
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000 a story to yourself so many times.
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000 It's like, it becomes, it never happened,
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000 but it's like now it's like, I remember Roy told me this one
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000 time, he's like, we went on this moose hunt.
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.000 And I've been like, yeah, I've never had actually never had a
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000 shot at a moose.
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000 And he's like, you, you blew it on a giant bull.
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000 And I'm like, when?
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000 He goes, remember on the river and the pouring rain?
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000 And you hit low on that giant bull on the other side of the river?
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000 And I was like, oh my god.
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.000 I had totally blocked that out of my memory.
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000 I had, I had made this truth in my head
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000 that I'd never shot at a moose.
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.000 No, I just didn't want to remember when I blew it.
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000 I had definitely shot it on a moose.
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000 So anyway, who knows if this last story is kind of like this?
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000 But all I know is, we were running and I was running behind him.
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.000 And I was hurting this dying, like, third, my old 13 of the race.
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000 And I remember, it was behind him, he had this gold single
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.000 and on, like, he always wore, because like, I called it the tour.
01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000 And I was looking at his calves and I was like,
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000 God, he's probably just feels strong.
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000 He's not tired at all enough fatigue.
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000 And I was like, god, why can't I be an Olympic athlete?
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000 You know, he made the Olympics too.
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.000 And I just thought he was probably just fresh as can be.
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.000 And I'm just this fucking 40 year old dad dying.
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000 And I get up, I'm like, I'm going to go.
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000 I don't care how bad this hurts.
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000 I'm just, you know, burst into flames,
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.000 puke, throw up, collapse, who knows what's going to happen.
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.000 So I fight, fight, fight, takes me in a while and I get up beside him.
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000 So we're running side by side.
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000 And he goes, he looks over, probably because I was staring at him.
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000 I'm gonna go, maybe I was touching his arm.
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000 I don't know.
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:43.000 But he goes, he goes, is this heartbreak hill?
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.000 And I said no, and I said, yeah, I said it's still up here.
01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000 It's like, oh, fuck, I'm dying.
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000 And I was just like, oh, I'm dying too.
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000 But I didn't know you were dying.
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000 So that gave me like a weird boost.
01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000 You know, this man God is dying.
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000 And here, I'm a Raylor man,
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000 and I'm dying, so it's like, okay, so we kept going,
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000 keep going.
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000 And he and up saying, hey, what's your pace today?
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000 And I told him he's like, you met my,
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000 who knows if this happened.
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000 I think it did.
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.000 But, since you might have run with you,
01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000 and I'm like, no, it's like, yeah,
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000 250.
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000 So we ran together.
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000 And yeah, it's like, shared a few words.
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000 I remember people like,
01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000 LATS, what, 10,000 times.
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000 I remember this one guy ran up by him.
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.96 And he's like, he was, I had to stick your
01:38:31.96 --> 01:38:32.96 hands or two.
01:38:32.96 --> 01:38:37.96 LATS is like, I mean, we're running this race.
01:38:37.96 --> 01:38:40.96 And he's like, I don't even know how your social response.
01:38:40.96 --> 01:38:42.96 You know, so it was just a weird,
01:38:42.96 --> 01:38:44.96 but I was right there for all of this.
01:38:44.96 --> 01:38:48.96 Anyway, we, I, I, I finished 12 seconds.
01:38:48.96 --> 01:38:51.96 I think or something ahead of him in that race.
01:38:51.96 --> 01:38:52.96 But we had this connection.
01:38:52.96 --> 01:38:53.96 Yeah.
01:38:53.96 --> 01:38:54.96 So so much of,
01:38:54.96 --> 01:38:57.96 the older is why I'm maybe going to make it out.
01:38:57.96 --> 01:39:00.96 So even though we're saying that it was the race
01:39:00.96 --> 01:39:03.96 between you and him, but it was really only in your mind.
01:39:03.96 --> 01:39:04.96 Yeah.
01:39:04.96 --> 01:39:07.96 When someone starts pulling ahead of you in a run,
01:39:07.96 --> 01:39:08.96 that's a thing.
01:39:08.96 --> 01:39:09.96 Right.
01:39:09.96 --> 01:39:13.96 So like, at some point, you had to start pulling ahead of it, right?
01:39:13.96 --> 01:39:14.96 Yeah.
01:39:14.96 --> 01:39:17.96 I mean, he had this, there's a motorcade around him.
01:39:17.96 --> 01:39:19.96 Because the, the, the, the,
01:39:19.96 --> 01:39:20.96 he leads finished.
01:39:20.96 --> 01:39:25.96 Probably two, maybe 10 to 8 to 08.
01:39:25.96 --> 01:39:27.96 And we were back at 250.
01:39:27.96 --> 01:39:30.96 So, um, they had finished.
01:39:30.96 --> 01:39:32.96 So then the story for the TV was Lance.
01:39:32.96 --> 01:39:34.96 Because Lance was running Boston.
01:39:34.96 --> 01:39:38.96 So there's like this motorcycle and had a camera on it and all the stuff.
01:39:38.96 --> 01:39:42.96 And so yeah, there's some overhead shots and, and we were on TV.
01:39:42.96 --> 01:39:45.96 And my wife, you know, I had told my boys, this is in the book too,
01:39:45.96 --> 01:39:49.96 but I told my boys that, hey, I'm going to go to Boston and,
01:39:49.96 --> 01:39:52.96 and, uh, I'm going to beat Lance Armstrong in the race.
01:39:52.96 --> 01:39:54.96 Again, he last doesn't know anything about me.
01:39:54.96 --> 01:39:58.96 But anyway, they thought I was like, you know, just talking out my ass.
01:39:58.96 --> 01:40:01.96 They were, they were laugh and you can't beat Lance Armstrong.
01:40:01.96 --> 01:40:04.96 Because they'd been a little oxygen in the TV forever.
01:40:04.96 --> 01:40:08.96 And he was such a legend in the, in the tour, you know, he just, you know,
01:40:08.96 --> 01:40:12.96 cocky and blew by people and just dominate and rubbed in their face.
01:40:12.96 --> 01:40:17.96 And he's like, so it was like, you know, he had this, this thing about him.
01:40:17.96 --> 01:40:19.96 And, and this aura.
01:40:19.96 --> 01:40:23.96 So I said I was going to go back to run with him and then beat him at the end.
01:40:23.96 --> 01:40:25.96 They laughed.
01:40:25.96 --> 01:40:29.96 And so then on TV, I'm running with Lance Armstrong.
01:40:29.96 --> 01:40:32.96 I have this camo top on that I cut the sleeves off of.
01:40:32.96 --> 01:40:34.96 He's got always Nike gear.
01:40:34.96 --> 01:40:36.96 And there I am.
01:40:36.96 --> 01:40:37.96 And we're running.
01:40:37.96 --> 01:40:40.96 And then so at the end of my quote, I told myself, I'm not going to
01:40:40.96 --> 01:40:43.96 fucking run this whole way and not do what I said.
01:40:43.96 --> 01:40:48.96 So I took off and it came across and for he had his own finish line.
01:40:48.96 --> 01:40:51.96 So he had to go up, veer over to the right.
01:40:51.96 --> 01:40:55.96 But there's why I think maybe I didn't make all of it up.
01:40:55.96 --> 01:40:58.96 100% was because he finished and then he pointed at me.
01:40:58.96 --> 01:41:03.96 I like I went over there and and we shook hands and said, you know,
01:41:03.96 --> 01:41:04.96 good job.
01:41:04.96 --> 01:41:06.96 So we had a heat whatever.
01:41:06.96 --> 01:41:08.96 And they got a picture.
01:41:08.96 --> 01:41:09.96 I can't remember if it's in the book or not.
01:41:09.96 --> 01:41:14.96 But yeah, so I mean, it was for me.
01:41:14.96 --> 01:41:19.96 Dude, that was, that was, that felt like I was almost athletic.
01:41:19.96 --> 01:41:24.96 You know, that time I was like, this is this, it would be like winning a gold medal.
01:41:24.96 --> 01:41:25.96 I thought.
01:41:25.96 --> 01:41:30.96 So it was and you've got home and your kids were you told your kids.
01:41:30.96 --> 01:41:31.96 Like, they saw it.
01:41:31.96 --> 01:41:32.96 No, they saw it.
01:41:32.96 --> 01:41:33.96 They saw it.
01:41:33.96 --> 01:41:33.96 They were a lot.
01:41:33.96 --> 01:41:34.96 Well, true was at home.
01:41:34.96 --> 01:41:35.96 He's watching.
01:41:35.96 --> 01:41:37.96 And then here's how big a deal lasts.
01:41:37.96 --> 01:41:41.96 It's time they announced it on the school intercom that Tanner and
01:41:41.96 --> 01:41:46.96 true is dad beat Lance Armstrong in the Boston Maritime.
01:41:46.96 --> 01:41:51.96 So, you know, Eugene is known as a running capital of the world.
01:41:51.96 --> 01:41:54.96 You know, we had the Olympic, the Olympic trials there all the time.
01:41:54.96 --> 01:41:56.96 So running is kind of a big thing there.
01:41:56.96 --> 01:41:59.96 So to have and everybody knows Boston, everybody knows Lance.
01:41:59.96 --> 01:42:02.96 So it's like his perfect storm.
01:42:02.96 --> 01:42:04.96 But for me, it was after.
01:42:04.96 --> 01:42:06.96 Where do you record him with him?
01:42:06.96 --> 01:42:07.96 I don't know.
01:42:07.96 --> 01:42:08.96 We have to schedule it.
01:42:08.96 --> 01:42:09.96 Okay.
01:42:09.96 --> 01:42:11.96 So I was going to say if you get this podcast out.
01:42:11.96 --> 01:42:13.96 Hopefully you won't hear this one before he gets you.
01:42:13.96 --> 01:42:17.96 Because otherwise, I don't know.
01:42:17.96 --> 01:42:19.96 You either I'll be ready for you.
01:42:19.96 --> 01:42:20.96 I know.
01:42:20.96 --> 01:42:21.96 He'll be like, no.
01:42:21.96 --> 01:42:22.96 Yeah.
01:42:22.96 --> 01:42:23.96 That did not happen.
01:42:23.96 --> 01:42:24.96 I.
01:42:24.96 --> 01:42:27.96 All right.
01:42:27.96 --> 01:42:29.96 So speaking of running.
01:42:29.96 --> 01:42:35.96 Here we go with over 17,000 feet of elevation gain.
01:42:35.96 --> 01:42:40.96 The big horn 100 was one of the toughest 100 mile foot races in the United States.
01:42:40.96 --> 01:42:42.96 It would be my first ultra over 50 miles.
01:42:42.96 --> 01:42:46.96 The previous year at the big horn 50, I finished third overall.
01:42:46.96 --> 01:42:51.96 It would be my first race where I would be required to run through the night.
01:42:51.96 --> 01:42:56.96 My wife was having second thoughts and tried to persuade me to reconsider.
01:42:56.96 --> 01:42:58.96 You said I've already done a 50 mile.
01:42:58.96 --> 01:43:05.96 And my goal is to find out exactly what I can do to find where's my breaking point.
01:43:05.96 --> 01:43:08.96 So at this point, you've done some 50 miles.
01:43:08.96 --> 01:43:10.96 And now you're going for the hundo.
01:43:10.96 --> 01:43:17.96 Yeah, because in the ultra marathon world, it's until you do a hundred.
01:43:17.96 --> 01:43:19.96 It doesn't even.
01:43:19.96 --> 01:43:20.96 It's like, I don't know.
01:43:20.96 --> 01:43:22.96 They don't even really count it.
01:43:22.96 --> 01:43:26.96 You know, like the 50 K, which is 32 miles or the 50 mile.
01:43:26.96 --> 01:43:28.96 It's like, well, have you done a hundred yet?
01:43:28.96 --> 01:43:31.96 So that's like the barrier of entry for the old.
01:43:31.96 --> 01:43:32.96 Yeah.
01:43:32.96 --> 01:43:33.96 And I had.
01:43:33.96 --> 01:43:35.96 So that was my first one.
01:43:35.96 --> 01:43:40.92 And you say the big one 100 is an out and back run consisting of 76 miles of single track
01:43:40.92 --> 01:43:47.92 and 60 miles of rugged double track cheap trail and eight miles of gravel road with 17,500 feet of climbing,
01:43:47.92 --> 01:43:49.92 18,000 feet of descent.
01:43:49.92 --> 01:43:51.92 So I looked at the map of this.
01:43:51.92 --> 01:43:52.92 I went online.
01:43:52.92 --> 01:43:54.92 It looked like.
01:43:54.92 --> 01:43:58.92 So it sort of looks like you're going up and down mountains the whole time.
01:43:58.92 --> 01:44:00.92 Are you going on a ridge line or something?
01:44:00.92 --> 01:44:01.92 But what is it?
01:44:01.92 --> 01:44:02.92 Are you an out of mountains?
01:44:02.92 --> 01:44:04.92 No, you're.
01:44:04.92 --> 01:44:05.92 So it starts.
01:44:05.92 --> 01:44:07.92 You start pretty high.
01:44:07.92 --> 01:44:14.92 And then you go, you go up to the 9,000 feet, then you stay on the ridge, then you drop all the way down to maybe 6,000 feet.
01:44:14.92 --> 01:44:18.92 And then you climb back at the 48 mile mark as a turnaround.
01:44:18.92 --> 01:44:24.92 And that climbs from 6,000 back up to about almost 10,000 probably 9 something.
01:44:24.92 --> 01:44:27.92 Let's a gradual climb up and then you reverse and come back.
01:44:27.92 --> 01:44:29.92 That's what struck me.
01:44:29.92 --> 01:44:35.92 It's very sucky when I looked at it because I was like, oh, you know, it kind of looks like,
01:44:35.92 --> 01:44:37.92 because they have a profile shot.
01:44:37.92 --> 01:44:38.92 Yeah.
01:44:38.92 --> 01:44:39.92 And they kind of just show you the elevation.
01:44:39.92 --> 01:44:40.92 And it's up down.
01:44:40.92 --> 01:44:43.92 It's basically up down up down up down down down down down down kind of descending.
01:44:43.92 --> 01:44:44.92 Right.
01:44:44.92 --> 01:44:45.92 Up down up down up.
01:44:45.92 --> 01:44:46.92 You're kind of slowly descending.
01:44:46.92 --> 01:44:50.92 And then I read your book and I was like, oh, and there's a turn around.
01:44:50.92 --> 01:44:52.92 So you go up down up down up down up down up down up down up down.
01:44:52.92 --> 01:44:53.92 And you're kind of descending.
01:44:53.92 --> 01:44:55.92 And then it's up down up down up down up.
01:44:55.92 --> 01:44:56.92 But going back up.
01:44:56.92 --> 01:45:04.92 Yeah, that there's a grind from I remember this specifically from I think 60 something to 82.
01:45:04.92 --> 01:45:07.92 And so hard.
01:45:07.92 --> 01:45:11.92 It was so just it was up the whole way and it started to get hot.
01:45:11.92 --> 01:45:14.92 And it's like you've been running all night.
01:45:14.92 --> 01:45:18.92 And you said, even 20 miles into it, you borrowed a camel back from somebody.
01:45:18.92 --> 01:45:20.92 You got that thing wearing holes into your back.
01:45:20.92 --> 01:45:21.92 It did.
01:45:21.92 --> 01:45:22.92 It.
01:45:22.92 --> 01:45:24.92 I never trained with it.
01:45:24.92 --> 01:45:26.92 And you went out of the gate like pre-fond team.
01:45:26.92 --> 01:45:27.92 Just go out.
01:45:27.92 --> 01:45:28.92 And hard as a good.
01:45:28.92 --> 01:45:31.92 What else is like the 800 meter back in middle school?
01:45:31.92 --> 01:45:34.92 Yeah, it was. Yeah.
01:45:34.92 --> 01:45:37.92 And I thought I was going to get it the turn around quicker.
01:45:37.92 --> 01:45:41.92 So I didn't have a headlamp because I thought it was going to be there.
01:45:41.92 --> 01:45:42.92 I had my head.
01:45:42.92 --> 01:45:43.92 Here's what I'm going to do.
01:45:43.92 --> 01:45:46.92 I'll get here at, you know, whatever it right when it's starting to get dark.
01:45:46.92 --> 01:45:48.92 But I didn't get there till about 11.
01:45:48.92 --> 01:45:50.92 12 hours into the race.
01:45:50.92 --> 01:45:51.92 And so it'd been dark for a couple hours.
01:45:51.92 --> 01:45:53.92 So I'm up in the snow.
01:45:53.92 --> 01:45:55.92 There's snow up there at the turn around.
01:45:55.92 --> 01:45:58.92 And pulse tolling through the snow with no light.
01:45:58.92 --> 01:46:01.92 And I get to the turn around and I'm like, oh my God.
01:46:01.92 --> 01:46:03.92 This is brutal.
01:46:03.92 --> 01:46:04.92 So that was my first one.
01:46:04.92 --> 01:46:07.92 That is 48 miles down at 52 left.
01:46:07.92 --> 01:46:10.92 You say in here that that 48 miles turn around.
01:46:10.92 --> 01:46:15.92 The porcupine aid station is real convenient spot for DNFers.
01:46:15.92 --> 01:46:19.92 That was the official notation on the race results for runners who quit.
01:46:19.92 --> 01:46:22.92 DNF did not finish.
01:46:22.92 --> 01:46:24.92 I saw guys at porcupine.
01:46:24.92 --> 01:46:25.92 Tough guys, obviously.
01:46:25.92 --> 01:46:26.92 I mean, hell, to get there.
01:46:26.92 --> 01:46:32.92 They just ran 48 miles to the last 18 uphill to the tune of a 4500 foot gain.
01:46:32.92 --> 01:46:34.92 Looking like they were on their deathbed.
01:46:34.92 --> 01:46:37.92 Raptain Blankets being attended by Medix.
01:46:37.92 --> 01:46:41.92 It was at porcupine that many called it a race.
01:46:41.92 --> 01:46:46.92 Yes, he having been in the military for a long time.
01:46:46.92 --> 01:46:48.92 Or I was in the military for a long time.
01:46:48.92 --> 01:46:51.92 And we would be going out on patrols.
01:46:51.92 --> 01:46:55.92 And you pay really close attention to how much elevation you're doing.
01:46:55.92 --> 01:46:57.92 You're going to gain or lose.
01:46:57.92 --> 01:46:59.92 You know, you're doing a map study.
01:46:59.92 --> 01:47:00.92 You're looking at the contour lines.
01:47:00.92 --> 01:47:01.92 Like you're figuring out.
01:47:01.92 --> 01:47:07.92 So when you say 4500 feet gain or a total of 18,000.
01:47:07.92 --> 01:47:09.92 That's a socks.
01:47:09.92 --> 01:47:10.92 Yeah.
01:47:10.92 --> 01:47:12.92 And that's what makes.
01:47:12.92 --> 01:47:13.92 It's not just the distance.
01:47:13.92 --> 01:47:14.92 It's a terrain too.
01:47:14.92 --> 01:47:18.92 And on trail also your body's like correcting all the time.
01:47:18.92 --> 01:47:22.92 You know, like on road, you'll see some elite marathoners.
01:47:22.92 --> 01:47:23.92 And they don't even have abs.
01:47:23.92 --> 01:47:27.92 You know, they kind of almost got a little pot belly because you can get so efficient
01:47:27.92 --> 01:47:29.92 at running on a road.
01:47:29.92 --> 01:47:34.92 In the mountains, you are correcting all your cores like getting taxed.
01:47:34.92 --> 01:47:37.92 Your quasi-gating tax is a whole different type of running.
01:47:37.92 --> 01:47:39.92 But it's taxing.
01:47:39.92 --> 01:47:41.92 What are you carrying on you?
01:47:41.92 --> 01:47:43.92 You got to take some water.
01:47:43.92 --> 01:47:44.92 Usually in some calories.
01:47:44.92 --> 01:47:45.92 So that's it.
01:47:45.92 --> 01:47:46.92 Yeah.
01:47:46.92 --> 01:47:53.92 You get to, you were trying to do it in how long?
01:47:53.92 --> 01:47:54.92 24 hours?
01:47:54.92 --> 01:47:55.92 Yeah.
01:47:55.92 --> 01:47:58.92 That's always the goal if you can break 24 hours and a hundred by
01:47:58.92 --> 01:48:00.92 or you're slid you it.
01:48:00.92 --> 01:48:01.92 You're legit.
01:48:01.92 --> 01:48:05.92 At 12 p.m., I topped out at mile 82.
01:48:05.92 --> 01:48:07.92 How is that 25 hours now?
01:48:07.92 --> 01:48:10.92 It's not under 24.
01:48:10.92 --> 01:48:12.92 And I still had 18 miles.
01:48:12.92 --> 01:48:13.92 Let's do it.
01:48:13.92 --> 01:48:18.92 By 3.10 p.m., I reached the last state station in mile 95.
01:48:18.92 --> 01:48:23.92 When I got to mile 95, Tanner was there waiting for me and ran the last five
01:48:23.92 --> 01:48:24.92 with his old man.
01:48:24.92 --> 01:48:28.92 That boy, I told him I couldn't stop because of my knee.
01:48:28.92 --> 01:48:33.92 And to said, we had an hour and 50 minutes to run five miles.
01:48:33.92 --> 01:48:36.92 Yeah, I wanted to definitely want to get in under 30 hours.
01:48:36.92 --> 01:48:37.92 Right.
01:48:37.92 --> 01:48:38.92 But 29.
01:48:38.92 --> 01:48:42.92 And was Tanner just like, I mean, you can run, you can run five miles in 30 minutes.
01:48:42.92 --> 01:48:46.92 Yeah, I mean, he was I think 14 at the time.
01:48:46.92 --> 01:48:50.92 And I kind of took him just kind of, you know, how we talked about
01:48:50.92 --> 01:48:51.92 we always turned it justify.
01:48:51.92 --> 01:48:53.92 And so I'm like, well, my son's there.
01:48:53.92 --> 01:48:56.92 It's like I'm not really himself.
01:48:56.92 --> 01:49:02.92 So he had to stay in the hotel by himself for a whole day, 29 hours.
01:49:02.92 --> 01:49:06.92 I had someone to give him a ride to that aid station to go to the last five.
01:49:06.92 --> 01:49:09.92 And he didn't really want to do five.
01:49:09.92 --> 01:49:14.92 So, but I was going pretty slow at that time.
01:49:14.92 --> 01:49:20.92 At 420 p.m. a hundred miles, we're in the books official time 29 hours, 20 minutes.
01:49:20.92 --> 01:49:23.92 I was a hundred mile ultra marathoner.
01:49:23.92 --> 01:49:26.92 I earned my first hundred mile belt buckle.
01:49:26.92 --> 01:49:31.92 Yeah, that's what you get instead of a medal or a trophy or anything.
01:49:31.92 --> 01:49:33.92 You did usually have belt buckle.
01:49:33.92 --> 01:49:36.92 Is that just like outwester, is that everywhere?
01:49:36.92 --> 01:49:40.92 Uh, I don't know. Maybe out. I'm not sure.
01:49:40.92 --> 01:49:41.92 Hmm.
01:49:41.92 --> 01:49:43.92 Yeah.
01:49:43.92 --> 01:49:44.92 Check.
01:49:44.92 --> 01:49:46.92 Hundred miles.
01:49:47.92 --> 01:49:50.92 Fast forward a little bit here.
01:49:50.92 --> 01:49:57.92 You say, in the final year of my dad's life, he reminded me once again how much I respected and admired him.
01:49:57.92 --> 01:50:02.92 From the moment doctors discovered a lump on his liver, Bob Haines began his fight with cancer.
01:50:02.92 --> 01:50:06.92 It was an aggressive form of cancer, but he never gave up.
01:50:06.92 --> 01:50:09.92 For 18 months, he waged a war against it.
01:50:09.92 --> 01:50:16.92 I'm going to beat it. He told me, everybody who gets cancer says this and sometimes they do.
01:50:16.92 --> 01:50:23.92 So, your dad comes down with with liver cancer.
01:50:23.92 --> 01:50:29.92 Um, you, you, you talk about that and here and as you're talking about that,
01:50:29.92 --> 01:50:36.92 you still are working your job, you're still being a dad and you're still training and you're still running.
01:50:36.92 --> 01:50:37.92 Hmm.
01:50:37.92 --> 01:50:45.92 Then you have a goal and you say the most coveted award in the Ultraman Marathoning World is the silver buckle awarded
01:50:45.92 --> 01:50:47.92 at the Western States and Durans run.
01:50:47.92 --> 01:50:52.92 It's the most famous 100 mile race in the world because of a history and competitiveness.
01:50:52.92 --> 01:51:00.92 I earned my buckle in my second 100 mile by finishing in under 24 hours at 22 hours and 41 minutes.
01:51:00.92 --> 01:51:11.92 In my world, if there was ever a comparison to an Olympic gold medal, it would be this silver buckle.
01:51:11.92 --> 01:51:13.92 So, you're going to go for this thing.
01:51:13.92 --> 01:51:20.92 On the drive down to where the race started in Olympic Valley, California, I talked to my dad on the phone and he didn't sound good.
01:51:20.92 --> 01:51:24.92 He'd been battling cancer for cancer for a year and a half.
01:51:24.92 --> 01:51:28.92 So, I knew in my heart he was nearing the end of his fight.
01:51:28.92 --> 01:51:37.92 As I ran, I took some solace and knowing he was following my progress live on the WS100.com website.
01:51:37.92 --> 01:51:46.92 At 341 AM, I crossed the finish line in Auburn, California and in doing so earned my silver Western States buckle.
01:51:46.92 --> 01:51:51.92 I just logged in nearly seven hour improvement over my first 100 mile race.
01:51:51.92 --> 01:51:59.92 I started out the race supremely confident during those 22 hours and 41 minutes of reflection while running doubt-crept in more than once.
01:51:59.92 --> 01:52:04.92 Through those struggles, I kept telling myself that my pain was temporary.
01:52:04.92 --> 01:52:08.92 In a few days time, I would be healed up and richer from the experience.
01:52:08.92 --> 01:52:11.92 For my dad, there would be no healing.
01:52:11.92 --> 01:52:20.92 There would be, there would only be deeper and more debilitating pain and sickness than death.
01:52:20.92 --> 01:52:23.92 I finished the race that Sunday morning.
01:52:23.92 --> 01:52:27.92 We drove home that day, getting home very late.
01:52:27.92 --> 01:52:31.92 I went to work the next day.
01:52:31.92 --> 01:52:36.92 I will never forget looking into dad's eyes upon my return from the race and saying, Dad,
01:52:36.92 --> 01:52:44.92 I wish I could give you some of my strength. Don't give up on me yet. He told me.
01:52:44.92 --> 01:52:47.92 He still thought he was going to beat it.
01:52:47.92 --> 01:52:50.92 I will never forget his will to live.
01:52:50.92 --> 01:52:55.92 A handful of days after I earned my silver buckle in the Western States race,
01:52:55.92 --> 01:53:00.92 my dad passed on early in the day on July 5th.
01:53:00.92 --> 01:53:08.92 The pain of losing him was much worse than any had felt before from the race's life or anything.
01:53:08.92 --> 01:53:17.92 I was a bit of a hard time.
01:53:17.92 --> 01:53:35.92 It was like a big transition because on July 4th every year,
01:53:35.92 --> 01:53:39.92 there's the butebutin K and Eugene.
01:53:39.92 --> 01:53:44.92 My dad has how he lived with my stepmom candy pretty close to the course.
01:53:44.92 --> 01:53:51.92 They would walk down to Dairy Mart and we would be doing the 10 K and run by him every time, every year forever.
01:53:51.92 --> 01:53:56.92 I'm running that day, July 4th, 2010.
01:53:56.92 --> 01:54:02.92 The day before he died and I was getting up there by Dairy Mart, no dad.
01:54:02.92 --> 01:54:05.92 He never missed.
01:54:05.92 --> 01:54:12.92 It's like I said, running this so important, the biggest race in Eugene.
01:54:12.92 --> 01:54:21.92 It was, I mean, I knew, but people with cancer, it's always this thing.
01:54:21.92 --> 01:54:26.92 No one quite if you people haven't, everybody's going to beat it and you just know.
01:54:26.92 --> 01:54:32.92 It's heartbreaking because they're not going to beat it.
01:54:32.92 --> 01:54:39.92 The chemo is going to, you know, it can take the chemo so long so the cancer is held back for a while,
01:54:39.92 --> 01:54:44.92 but then once you stop the chemo because your body can't take it, then the cancer comes back.
01:54:44.92 --> 01:54:51.92 Harder and it's like everybody kind of knows the routine, but nobody wants to talk about it.
01:54:51.92 --> 01:55:01.92 But I knew. And so then not seeing him there that day and then he died that early in the morning at July 5th.
01:55:01.92 --> 01:55:11.92 And how did he go over there and, you know, it was just a, you know,
01:55:11.92 --> 01:55:18.92 when somebody dies at the house like he did, you have to have the funeral home or whoever come over.
01:55:18.92 --> 01:55:21.92 So he comes over and he's by himself.
01:55:21.92 --> 01:55:25.92 And my dad's room is upstairs and he's like, I said, how are you?
01:55:25.92 --> 01:55:29.92 How are you getting them down? He's like, well, could you help me?
01:55:29.92 --> 01:55:36.92 And so we had to put him in a bag and had to help carry him out.
01:55:36.92 --> 01:55:45.92 And it's like, I don't know, it's one of those, he's never forget, never forget that.
01:55:45.92 --> 01:55:53.92 And so it's just death, this journey, you know, your dad not being around.
01:55:53.92 --> 01:56:00.92 And it's like, it makes all the other, like I say in there, the physical pain, just seem like nothing to me.
01:56:00.92 --> 01:56:05.92 What did your dad think about the, the freaking hundred mile races?
01:56:05.92 --> 01:56:09.92 Because those weren't really around when your dad was running.
01:56:09.92 --> 01:56:14.92 No, he probably, I mean, he would act like he cared,
01:56:14.92 --> 01:56:19.92 but, you know, he was more of a Olympic event person,
01:56:19.92 --> 01:56:23.92 Poverty, high-jump, running.
01:56:23.92 --> 01:56:29.92 You know, the altars are kind of like the kind of a weird offshoot of that, you know.
01:56:29.92 --> 01:56:35.92 So he's probably like, well, for he probably think it was better than Bohani,
01:56:35.92 --> 01:56:40.92 because he'd never hunted, he's just an athlete his whole life, so he would say,
01:56:40.92 --> 01:56:44.92 you know, when I kill an animal, I'd lose brain cells.
01:56:44.92 --> 01:56:50.92 So he was like pretty liberal, South-E-Gee's a pretty liberal school and you gene.
01:56:50.92 --> 01:56:55.92 And he was track coach there forever, so he never got the hunting part,
01:56:55.92 --> 01:57:00.92 but he, you know, so the altars are probably a little better than hunting.
01:57:00.92 --> 01:57:06.92 He gets to celebrate those little more, but still not quite as good as, you know, real track.
01:57:06.92 --> 01:57:11.92 I don't think like dads are ever impressed by anything.
01:57:11.92 --> 01:57:15.92 You know, they're always just like, well, you know.
01:57:15.92 --> 01:57:17.92 That's a tough crowd.
01:57:17.92 --> 01:57:26.92 Yeah, I remember I was a lathe who I wrote extreme ownership with,
01:57:26.92 --> 01:57:29.92 and we made the New York Times bestseller list, right?
01:57:29.92 --> 01:57:34.92 And so I called my parents, I was like, hey, you know,
01:57:34.92 --> 01:57:37.92 and lathe, lathe remembers this because I had him on speaker,
01:57:37.92 --> 01:57:40.92 as I came, I just found out we made the New York Times bestseller list.
01:57:40.92 --> 01:57:45.92 And my mom was like, well, it really, what really counts is how long
01:57:45.92 --> 01:57:47.92 stay on their phone.
01:57:47.92 --> 01:57:50.92 I was like, good boy.
01:57:50.92 --> 01:57:52.92 Yeah, I was like, cool, later.
01:57:52.92 --> 01:57:54.92 Yeah, good boy.
01:57:54.92 --> 01:57:57.92 Yeah, I was like, cool, yeah, my boss, you know.
01:57:57.92 --> 01:57:59.92 Sorry about that.
01:57:59.92 --> 01:58:00.92 Sorry about that.
01:58:00.92 --> 01:58:05.92 Yeah, I just wanted to taste that thing.
01:58:05.92 --> 01:58:06.92 I just wanted to taste that thing.
01:58:06.92 --> 01:58:08.92 I was like, the very bottom of this tasted.
01:58:08.92 --> 01:58:11.92 Dude, one minute, I'm going to go on records saying,
01:58:11.92 --> 01:58:14.92 if your book doesn't, you book out, they'll make it.
01:58:14.92 --> 01:58:18.92 I'm going on record as saying, it will make it.
01:58:18.92 --> 01:58:19.92 It will make it.
01:58:19.92 --> 01:58:23.92 Dude, if the freaking, the tour you're doing right now,
01:58:23.92 --> 01:58:25.92 yeah, it will make it.
01:58:25.92 --> 01:58:26.92 Yeah, it will make it.
01:58:26.92 --> 01:58:27.92 Yeah.
01:58:27.92 --> 01:58:32.92 Yeah, and they're, you know, it's not based on sales.
01:58:32.92 --> 01:58:36.92 It's based on whatever their weird voodoo is.
01:58:36.92 --> 01:58:37.92 Yeah.
01:58:37.92 --> 01:58:39.92 It'd be the upset of the century if it makes it.
01:58:39.92 --> 01:58:42.92 Well, you know, you know, Jordan Peterson's book,
01:58:42.92 --> 01:58:44.92 12 rules for life if you ever heard of that.
01:58:44.92 --> 01:58:47.92 Yeah, it's literally the biggest selling book in the past.
01:58:47.92 --> 01:58:48.92 I don't know how long.
01:58:48.92 --> 01:58:50.92 Yeah, it didn't make it.
01:58:50.92 --> 01:58:55.92 So that is, yeah.
01:58:55.92 --> 01:58:57.92 I don't know.
01:58:57.92 --> 01:58:59.92 Yeah, they got their own little.
01:58:59.92 --> 01:59:01.92 They got their own things they're promoting over there.
01:59:01.92 --> 01:59:02.92 Yeah.
01:59:02.92 --> 01:59:08.92 Anyways, going back to this book, you got a whole section in here on a bunch of people.
01:59:08.92 --> 01:59:10.92 Courtney, how do you say her last name?
01:59:10.92 --> 01:59:11.92 The Walter.
01:59:11.92 --> 01:59:14.92 You got Courtney DeWalter, Michael Chandler,
01:59:14.92 --> 01:59:19.92 Connor McGregor, Connor McGregor, David Goggins.
01:59:19.92 --> 01:59:25.92 You talk about Jordan, Kobe, Brady, Tiger, Steve from Prefonte.
01:59:25.92 --> 01:59:31.92 You just got a bunch of awesome freaking athletes and studs that you talk about,
01:59:31.92 --> 01:59:33.92 kind of what you take away from all of them.
01:59:33.92 --> 01:59:36.92 So that was a pretty cool section.
01:59:36.92 --> 01:59:40.92 And then like you said, you've gotten to meet all these people and
01:59:40.92 --> 01:59:41.92 freaking hang out with them.
01:59:41.92 --> 01:59:42.92 Yeah.
01:59:42.92 --> 01:59:43.92 Did you meet Tiger?
01:59:43.92 --> 01:59:44.92 No, no.
01:59:44.92 --> 01:59:46.92 No, and not, I just like their minds.
01:59:46.92 --> 01:59:48.92 Yeah, well, Jordan, Kobe, Brady and
01:59:48.92 --> 01:59:54.92 Oh, they'll you exchange some, like, social media with Brady with Brady.
01:59:54.92 --> 01:59:55.92 Yeah.
01:59:55.92 --> 01:59:59.92 And I have talked to Connor before, but all I ever said to Connor was,
01:59:59.92 --> 02:00:02.92 this is kind of he's on his come up.
02:00:02.92 --> 02:00:04.92 And he was like really taken off.
02:00:04.92 --> 02:00:05.92 And he was sitting there.
02:00:05.92 --> 02:00:07.92 I was, you know, Joe had the hook up for the seats.
02:00:07.92 --> 02:00:10.92 You know, God bless, Joe and UFC.
02:00:10.92 --> 02:00:13.92 But so Connor was sitting there with his girlfriend.
02:00:13.92 --> 02:00:16.92 And I go over there and I just said, I go,
02:00:16.92 --> 02:00:19.92 I said, how have you ever lost?
02:00:19.92 --> 02:00:22.92 Because he had two, he has two had two losses at this time.
02:00:22.92 --> 02:00:23.92 Yeah.
02:00:23.92 --> 02:00:27.92 He was, I think he's cage warriors or whatever over there.
02:00:27.92 --> 02:00:28.92 Yeah.
02:00:28.92 --> 02:00:31.92 And then came up and it was on a pretty good tear in the UFC.
02:00:31.92 --> 02:00:33.92 But I was like, he has two losses.
02:00:33.92 --> 02:00:35.92 And I said, how have you ever lost?
02:00:35.92 --> 02:00:37.92 Because you see him on beatable right now.
02:00:37.92 --> 02:00:41.92 And he's like, well, just young, just wasn't that good.
02:00:41.92 --> 02:00:45.92 So anyway, that was only time I've had a big change towards with him.
02:00:45.92 --> 02:00:50.92 But yeah, I never met Kobe, but I took a lot and Jordan, I have him at him.
02:00:50.92 --> 02:00:55.92 But that mindset, you know, the winning mindset, everybody can take something from those guys.
02:00:55.92 --> 02:00:56.92 Yeah.
02:00:56.92 --> 02:00:59.92 How good was that documentary the last dance?
02:00:59.92 --> 02:01:01.92 Oh my God, I loved it.
02:01:01.92 --> 02:01:02.92 I loved it.
02:01:02.92 --> 02:01:03.92 Yeah.
02:01:03.92 --> 02:01:07.92 Speaking of dads, you know how well, like, dads never listen anything that you say.
02:01:07.92 --> 02:01:08.92 Right.
02:01:08.92 --> 02:01:10.92 So my dad's a sports fanatic.
02:01:10.92 --> 02:01:12.92 A sports fanatic.
02:01:12.92 --> 02:01:15.92 And I go, hey, you should really watch this thing in the last dance.
02:01:15.92 --> 02:01:16.92 I don't know.
02:01:16.92 --> 02:01:21.92 I can't get him to watch it.
02:01:21.92 --> 02:01:23.92 I still have his little watch to.
02:01:23.92 --> 02:01:24.92 He's a one person in the world.
02:01:24.92 --> 02:01:25.92 Yeah.
02:01:25.92 --> 02:01:26.92 He's a one person in the world.
02:01:26.92 --> 02:01:29.92 Who is a basketball fanatic to coach the basketball.
02:01:29.92 --> 02:01:30.92 Back as you brought it up.
02:01:30.92 --> 02:01:32.92 Referee basketball.
02:01:32.92 --> 02:01:41.92 And I said, hey, hey, dad, this is probably like the coolest thing that's ever been made about basketball from a media perspective.
02:01:41.92 --> 02:01:42.92 Yeah.
02:01:42.92 --> 02:01:43.92 You should really watch it.
02:01:43.92 --> 02:01:44.92 You will really enjoy it.
02:01:44.92 --> 02:01:45.92 Yeah.
02:01:45.92 --> 02:01:46.92 You should have told him not to watch it.
02:01:46.92 --> 02:01:49.92 I should have told him it was stupid.
02:01:49.92 --> 02:01:51.92 Yeah.
02:01:51.92 --> 02:01:52.92 Yeah.
02:01:52.92 --> 02:01:53.92 I know.
02:01:53.92 --> 02:01:55.92 They did a such a good job.
02:01:55.92 --> 02:01:57.92 And Jordan's mindset.
02:01:57.92 --> 02:01:58.92 Oh my God.
02:01:58.92 --> 02:02:01.92 How do you know, I love when he's like getting on the guys.
02:02:01.92 --> 02:02:02.92 Oh, yeah.
02:02:02.92 --> 02:02:03.92 Yeah.
02:02:03.92 --> 02:02:04.92 Yeah.
02:02:04.92 --> 02:02:05.92 All those.
02:02:05.92 --> 02:02:06.92 And then the next, see, I grew up.
02:02:06.92 --> 02:02:08.92 And you probably get well, see.
02:02:08.92 --> 02:02:09.92 You're older than me.
02:02:09.92 --> 02:02:14.92 But by the time Jordan's time was here, I was already in the military.
02:02:14.92 --> 02:02:19.92 So I wasn't tracking as hard as I was as I was in the 80s, right?
02:02:19.92 --> 02:02:27.92 When it was, you know, the Celtics and the Lakers and me being from New England, it was like Celtics, 100% all day long.
02:02:27.92 --> 02:02:29.92 And Larry Bird is like a god.
02:02:29.92 --> 02:02:30.92 Oh, yeah.
02:02:30.92 --> 02:02:35.92 And then you have Larry Bird because Larry Bird's attitude is savage, similar.
02:02:35.92 --> 02:02:38.92 And, you know, the thing that they say about Bird,
02:02:38.92 --> 02:02:40.92 and they say this and you can go back and forth and whatever.
02:02:40.92 --> 02:02:49.92 But, you know, that Bird wasn't as athletic as a lot of players in the NBA, but he was just such a hard worker that he was just going to outwork you.
02:02:49.92 --> 02:02:50.92 Right.
02:02:50.92 --> 02:02:51.92 And that's what he was going to do.
02:02:51.92 --> 02:02:55.92 So my mindset was always like, I'm just going to have to work harder.
02:02:55.92 --> 02:02:56.92 Yeah.
02:02:56.92 --> 02:02:57.92 Like Bird.
02:02:57.92 --> 02:02:58.92 Yeah.
02:02:58.92 --> 02:03:04.92 Like, and that, you know, my dad, when I played basketball, if I didn't come home with like, skinned knees from diving on the floor,
02:03:04.92 --> 02:03:05.92 Yeah.
02:03:05.92 --> 02:03:06.92 That was like a fail.
02:03:06.92 --> 02:03:07.92 Right.
02:03:07.92 --> 02:03:07.92 Exactly.
02:03:07.92 --> 02:03:11.92 Well, yeah, me and Tanner, Tanner was a basketball player.
02:03:11.92 --> 02:03:16.92 And he, we had so many battles because I was probably like your dad.
02:03:16.92 --> 02:03:19.92 And I would just be like, piss the whole time watching a play.
02:03:19.92 --> 02:03:22.92 He would score 32 and a half one game.
02:03:22.92 --> 02:03:25.92 And I'm like, I'm like, you're not even playing defense.
02:03:25.92 --> 02:03:26.92 You know, yeah.
02:03:26.92 --> 02:03:33.92 I go, you're not, you're not getting, I said, as soon as I ball leaves our hand from whoever you're guarding,
02:03:33.92 --> 02:03:37.92 it has to go all the way to the floor and all the way back into the hand during that time.
02:03:37.92 --> 02:03:39.92 Why don't you dive on it?
02:03:39.92 --> 02:03:46.92 So then he finally, like, years later now, he watched some old tapes from high school.
02:03:46.92 --> 02:03:49.92 And he's like, God, daddy, because I can't believe how lazy I was in defense.
02:03:49.92 --> 02:03:51.92 And I'm like, no shit.
02:03:51.92 --> 02:03:53.92 We had so many fights about it.
02:03:53.92 --> 02:03:54.92 Yeah.
02:03:54.92 --> 02:03:55.92 I sucked, by the way, I noticed that.
02:03:55.92 --> 02:03:56.92 No, everyone.
02:03:56.92 --> 02:03:57.92 I sucked at basketball.
02:03:57.92 --> 02:04:00.92 I wasn't hostile to the, I was just hostile.
02:04:00.92 --> 02:04:01.92 I would steal.
02:04:01.92 --> 02:04:04.92 You know, I'd play, I would play D.
02:04:04.92 --> 02:04:05.92 Yeah.
02:04:05.92 --> 02:04:08.92 Well, that Larry Bird gave white guys hope.
02:04:08.92 --> 02:04:14.92 But what people, what most people skip over is he was also like, what six, six, nine.
02:04:14.92 --> 02:04:15.92 Nine?
02:04:15.92 --> 02:04:16.92 Yeah.
02:04:16.92 --> 02:04:19.92 So it's not like just a little white guy.
02:04:19.92 --> 02:04:21.92 He could shoot better than anybody.
02:04:21.92 --> 02:04:22.92 Yeah.
02:04:22.92 --> 02:04:22.92 He was a beast.
02:04:22.92 --> 02:04:23.92 Yeah.
02:04:23.92 --> 02:04:25.92 So you got that cool chapter.
02:04:25.92 --> 02:04:30.92 You're kind of talking about what you take away from all those, all those badass individuals.
02:04:30.92 --> 02:04:35.92 Then you got a section to hear this, this beast mode.
02:04:35.92 --> 02:04:37.92 There are no rest days.
02:04:37.92 --> 02:04:47.92 As irrational as it may seem in my mind, I'm not good enough to take a day off and I never will be running training and bow shooting have always been a therapy of sorts for me.
02:04:47.92 --> 02:04:52.92 What I call my lift, run shoot lifestyle is a means to an end.
02:04:52.92 --> 02:04:54.92 And that end is hunting.
02:04:54.92 --> 02:04:57.92 Preparation is key to achieve any goal.
02:04:57.92 --> 02:05:00.92 You cannot fall back on luck or talent.
02:05:00.92 --> 02:05:03.92 Those will leave you empty handed every time.
02:05:03.92 --> 02:05:06.92 You kind of made this point earlier and I knew this part was coming.
02:05:06.92 --> 02:05:14.92 Like you can theoretically not be in good shape and go out and you can kill a bull.
02:05:14.92 --> 02:05:16.92 It can happen.
02:05:16.92 --> 02:05:17.92 Yeah.
02:05:17.92 --> 02:05:26.92 And I've heard stories from guides telling me that there are people that show up to hunt that they really haven't really even cited in their bow yet.
02:05:26.92 --> 02:05:27.92 I know.
02:05:27.92 --> 02:05:28.92 I know.
02:05:28.92 --> 02:05:30.92 I couldn't imagine being a guide.
02:05:30.92 --> 02:05:37.92 I would hate to be like, I don't know how they just don't be like, what are you what in the hell is going on?
02:05:37.92 --> 02:05:42.92 Because also to me, it's like it shows respect to the animal when you show it prepared.
02:05:42.92 --> 02:05:45.92 You know, when you're not prepared, you're shooting an arrow.
02:05:45.92 --> 02:05:49.92 You can hit it in the guts, you hit in the ass, hit it in the wherever.
02:05:49.92 --> 02:05:54.92 It's like you don't care about that in almost life so literal or whatever.
02:05:54.92 --> 02:05:56.92 I worded that wrong.
02:05:56.92 --> 02:05:58.92 But I mean, it's so insignificant.
02:05:58.92 --> 02:06:00.92 You can't prepare for this hunt.
02:06:00.92 --> 02:06:02.92 That to me, I don't like that.
02:06:02.92 --> 02:06:05.92 Um, yeah.
02:06:05.92 --> 02:06:10.92 And then what you're saying, like, let's another underlying theme in your book is like,
02:06:10.92 --> 02:06:13.92 Sure, you can theoretically do that.
02:06:13.92 --> 02:06:20.92 But if you everything that you can do to be a little bit more prepared is going to just up your odds a little bit.
02:06:20.92 --> 02:06:21.92 Yeah.
02:06:21.92 --> 02:06:27.92 Well, I would always think that I've always thought about things and percentages and numbers.
02:06:27.92 --> 02:06:32.92 And I'd always think even in basketball, so you could go back because I played all these sports.
02:06:32.92 --> 02:06:36.92 But you know, try to get this to my kids and whatever.
02:06:36.92 --> 02:06:39.92 But it's like the, the, so you're in better shape.
02:06:39.92 --> 02:06:41.92 So your reaction time is probably a little quicker.
02:06:41.92 --> 02:06:50.92 So if you can get and it might just be one finger hits that ball that that slows that ball down enough for the next guy down the line to where that passes.
02:06:50.92 --> 02:06:52.92 Going, the ball's going slower.
02:06:52.92 --> 02:06:55.92 So they could get to the ball, knock a loose, kick it to you.
02:06:55.92 --> 02:06:57.92 You could score whatever.
02:06:57.92 --> 02:07:03.92 All, and that started with the finger tip, which started with preparation, which started with the reaction time.
02:07:03.92 --> 02:07:10.92 So it's like, I'd always say, you can't measure some of this stuff with these big, big factors and big numbers.
02:07:10.92 --> 02:07:15.92 But it's percentage wise, even if it's a tenth of a percent, that adds up.
02:07:15.92 --> 02:07:19.92 So the more I can do to add those percentages,
02:07:19.92 --> 02:07:22.92 I'm just going to be that much better.
02:07:22.92 --> 02:07:30.92 Yeah, that one tenth of a percent, that might be the one tenth of a percent that means a different success or failure.
02:07:30.92 --> 02:07:36.92 Yeah, because also I've thought about this in terms of hunting, where if that broad head blade.
02:07:36.92 --> 02:07:39.92 So I should have a poundage also when people want to criticize this.
02:07:39.92 --> 02:07:41.92 You don't need to shoot 90 pounds or whatever.
02:07:41.92 --> 02:07:47.92 So I'm always thinking like if that animal reacts and it's spinning when that arrow hits.
02:07:47.92 --> 02:07:56.92 And because that force that arrow is greater, where instead of kicking off the bone and going, say, to the right, it pushes through the bone.
02:07:56.92 --> 02:07:57.92 Get some more penetration.
02:07:57.92 --> 02:08:00.92 And maybe catch is that one artery with one blade.
02:08:00.92 --> 02:08:08.92 And that one blade cutting that artery because you have higher poundage and you're more prepared and you've got that arrow more where you wanted it to.
02:08:08.92 --> 02:08:13.92 That artery would drip a blood that maybe you lost blood.
02:08:13.92 --> 02:08:19.92 And then you found the one drop that led you the direction where the new found the animal or more blood.
02:08:19.92 --> 02:08:22.92 But it was that one drop that did that.
02:08:22.92 --> 02:08:27.92 What caused that extra drop of blood, which can make all the difference in the world.
02:08:27.92 --> 02:08:33.92 And it's like you can't tell me all the shit I think about and all the work I put in doesn't make a difference.
02:08:33.92 --> 02:08:36.92 Because you can't tell me that that's not an immeasurable.
02:08:36.92 --> 02:08:37.92 Yeah.
02:08:37.92 --> 02:08:38.92 That's that's a difference.
02:08:38.92 --> 02:08:43.92 I was shocked the first time I was following a blood trail.
02:08:43.92 --> 02:08:45.92 I was with Dudley.
02:08:45.92 --> 02:08:49.92 You are literally looking for blood.
02:08:49.92 --> 02:08:54.92 That is a size of a actually smaller than the size of a pinhead.
02:08:54.92 --> 02:08:55.92 Yeah.
02:08:55.92 --> 02:08:58.92 I was like holy shit.
02:08:58.92 --> 02:09:04.92 Like I'm following Dudley and he's walking all the sudden he's like right here because I'm following because I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
02:09:04.92 --> 02:09:10.92 You know what we find. He's like right here and I got to get up and basically get on my knees and go oh yeah I see it.
02:09:10.92 --> 02:09:10.92 Yeah.
02:09:10.92 --> 02:09:12.92 Freaking skills.
02:09:12.92 --> 02:09:13.92 Yeah.
02:09:13.92 --> 02:09:17.92 And that's another you know when I was talking earlier about all the different skills that come into play.
02:09:17.92 --> 02:09:19.92 That's just a shoot it.
02:09:19.92 --> 02:09:22.92 Because once you shoot it it you got to go find it.
02:09:22.92 --> 02:09:27.92 And there's a whole another incredible skill set that comes into play there.
02:09:27.92 --> 02:09:28.92 Yeah.
02:09:28.92 --> 02:09:30.92 And sometimes it's not even blood.
02:09:30.92 --> 02:09:32.92 Sometimes it could just be right fluid.
02:09:32.92 --> 02:09:36.92 Like if you hit back and maybe you hit guts that's not going to bleed.
02:09:36.92 --> 02:09:38.92 There's not a lot of blood in the guts.
02:09:38.92 --> 02:09:41.92 So but it might just be clear fluid.
02:09:41.92 --> 02:09:48.92 So it's not even a red drop of blood but you're like hey you're looking at you know kind of doing a little autopsy.
02:09:48.92 --> 02:09:51.92 You got to know you're like what you smell it.
02:09:51.92 --> 02:09:55.92 Do you the texture then that leads you to blood.
02:09:55.92 --> 02:10:00.92 But yeah it's a lot to a freaking hard game.
02:10:00.92 --> 02:10:03.92 Yeah. You say I'm not even the best bow shot.
02:10:03.92 --> 02:10:08.92 But I want to be there are guys in my hometown pro shop the bow rack.
02:10:08.92 --> 02:10:09.92 Yeah.
02:10:09.92 --> 02:10:12.92 That are better shots than me but I do work very hard at it.
02:10:12.92 --> 02:10:15.92 The key to my success is to throw hard work at everything I do.
02:10:15.92 --> 02:10:17.92 I can't scout elk every day.
02:10:17.92 --> 02:10:20.92 So I lift, run and shoot.
02:10:20.92 --> 02:10:21.92 Yeah.
02:10:21.92 --> 02:10:27.92 I just like feel like that's moving that needle on the right direction.
02:10:27.92 --> 02:10:35.92 You got a story in here that is really just lays all this out.
02:10:35.92 --> 02:10:39.92 Going back to the book, do I deserve to be here?
02:10:39.92 --> 02:10:44.92 I dreamt of hunting the sand Carlos Apache Indian reservation for decades.
02:10:44.92 --> 02:10:50.92 Located in southeastern Arizona and encompassing 8.8 million acres of land.
02:10:50.92 --> 02:10:55.92 Sand Carlos produces what I believe are the most amazing elk in the world.
02:10:55.92 --> 02:11:04.92 The reservation allocates only a handful of tags each year because the densities are low and they manage this country for trophy bowls.
02:11:04.92 --> 02:11:06.92 This means to hunt there is very expensive.
02:11:06.92 --> 02:11:16.92 Altogether, I want like that cost uport of $70,000, which is more than I've made annually for nearly all of my life.
02:11:16.92 --> 02:11:25.92 Compare that to the tag for my first out-of-state elk hunt in Wyoming, which costs $1100 bucks.
02:11:25.92 --> 02:11:29.92 Nobody wants to have to right-to-check that big and have nothing to show for it.
02:11:29.92 --> 02:11:33.92 So there's a lot riding on me making the perfect shot.
02:11:33.92 --> 02:11:37.92 Bo hunting, the biggest, most coveted elk in the world adds to this pressure.
02:11:37.92 --> 02:11:43.92 You can't stop thinking about all you've sacrificed and the years you've worked to pay for this opportunity
02:11:43.92 --> 02:11:48.92 to me that money essentially could affect the quality of life provided for my family.
02:11:48.92 --> 02:11:50.92 All this stuff starts weighing on you.
02:11:50.92 --> 02:11:54.92 That was why I kept wondering whether I deserved the honor to be at Sand Carlos.
02:11:54.92 --> 02:11:58.92 One of the many incredible hunting opportunities I've been blessed with over the years.
02:11:58.92 --> 02:12:01.92 I felt like I didn't belong or didn't really deserve the chance.
02:12:01.92 --> 02:12:09.92 I'm not sure why this is, but I know this perspective keeps me focusing on capitalizing and being appreciative of the experience.
02:12:09.92 --> 02:12:14.92 My goal was to live up to the expectations of being respectful, bow hunter,
02:12:14.92 --> 02:12:18.92 and celebrating these special elk mountains appropriately.
02:12:18.92 --> 02:12:24.92 Two words that come to mind are the ones Maximus says at the start of the battle in gladiator.
02:12:24.92 --> 02:12:26.92 Strength and honor.
02:12:26.92 --> 02:12:31.92 Bow hunters need to be strong mentally and physically, but they also need to show honor.
02:12:31.92 --> 02:12:37.92 Honor is to me, the attribute that makes bow hunting so special.
02:12:37.92 --> 02:12:46.92 So this is talk about like, what, for someone that doesn't understand hunting,
02:12:46.92 --> 02:12:52.92 what does it mean to go into this Indian reservation where they have limited number of elk.
02:12:52.92 --> 02:12:57.92 Their trophy elk, which means their monsters.
02:12:57.92 --> 02:13:01.92 And they can only allow so many people to hunt.
02:13:01.92 --> 02:13:09.92 And because they can only allow so many people to hunt and because the elk are so monstrous, they are going to charge money for it.
02:13:09.92 --> 02:13:12.92 Yeah, it's a supply and demand.
02:13:12.92 --> 02:13:20.92 This place, like years, like 20 years ago there'd be a VHS tape out and say, you know, giant bulls of Santa Carlos.
02:13:20.92 --> 02:13:22.92 We used to watch it at the bow rack.
02:13:22.92 --> 02:13:26.92 And these bulls seem surreal how big they were.
02:13:26.92 --> 02:13:36.92 And then the same species from the elk that we've we'd hunt, you know, giant bulls, 400 inch of owl, which is huge.
02:13:36.92 --> 02:13:39.92 So this was like a legendary place.
02:13:39.92 --> 02:13:43.92 And then because of the money, that eliminates a lot of people.
02:13:43.92 --> 02:13:44.92 Pretty much everybody.
02:13:44.92 --> 02:13:45.92 Pretty much everyone.
02:13:45.92 --> 02:13:53.92 But the thing with there, it takes more than money because there's a lot of guys with money.
02:13:53.92 --> 02:13:56.92 A lot of dickheads with money.
02:13:56.92 --> 02:13:59.92 The tribe is going to deal with a bunch of dickheads.
02:13:59.92 --> 02:14:03.92 They don't have to because they have the biggest bulls in the world.
02:14:03.92 --> 02:14:11.92 So I remember this guy sent me this message a while ago and he said, you know, how do you get to hunt Santa Carlos?
02:14:11.92 --> 02:14:16.92 I sent an email and I guess my 20 thousand dollars isn't enough for them.
02:14:16.92 --> 02:14:21.92 You know, I'm like, why can't I already tell you're probably just a dumb fuck?
02:14:21.92 --> 02:14:26.92 You know, so he could have, you know, offer a million.
02:14:26.92 --> 02:14:30.92 They should probably not get a chance to hunt there because they're not going to deal with that.
02:14:30.92 --> 02:14:36.92 So you have to be respectful, which I'm always respectful, but also I value what it means to hunt there.
02:14:36.92 --> 02:14:41.92 And then also of sacrifice a lot to build and have that money.
02:14:41.92 --> 02:14:43.92 And then still that wasn't enough.
02:14:43.92 --> 02:14:44.92 Still it took.
02:14:44.92 --> 02:14:52.92 And then he came up.
02:14:52.92 --> 02:14:55.92 Folks is who got me the first opportunity there and he had hunted there one year and they could tell what type of guy he was.
02:14:55.92 --> 02:14:57.92 He cared he's trying to do his best.
02:14:57.92 --> 02:15:02.92 He didn't have the greatest hunt, but he paid his dues and put it in the time there.
02:15:02.92 --> 02:15:08.92 And then this other tag came open and said, well, I've got a guy, you know, Cam.
02:15:08.92 --> 02:15:13.92 I think, you know, if we could give him an opportunity here, I'll think you'll buy that tag.
02:15:13.92 --> 02:15:14.76 what happened.
02:15:14.76 --> 02:15:17.12 But it takes more than just money.
02:15:17.12 --> 02:15:19.52 It takes a lot of things come in.
02:15:19.52 --> 02:15:21.16 And Kipfokx just for a little intro,
02:15:21.16 --> 02:15:23.92 he's one of the founders of Under Armor.
02:15:23.92 --> 02:15:27.28 And well, he was freaking college athlete
02:15:27.28 --> 02:15:30.64 stud, his damn self, playing lacrosse.
02:15:30.64 --> 02:15:34.68 And then really was a huge part of the driving force
02:15:34.68 --> 02:15:38.56 but behind the operations at Under Armor.
02:15:38.56 --> 02:15:43.000 And then was the driving force between behind the Under Armor
02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:44.92 and the front, yep, stuff.
02:15:44.92 --> 02:15:47.36 And now he's one of the driving forces behind the
02:15:47.36 --> 02:15:49.36 origin hunt FYI.
02:15:49.36 --> 02:15:50.52 Yeah.
02:15:50.52 --> 02:15:52.84 He's definitely found that's his niche.
02:15:52.84 --> 02:15:56.40 And he's such a hard worker and he cares about it.
02:15:56.40 --> 02:15:59.72 He cares about for whatever reason.
02:15:59.72 --> 02:16:04.20 That apparel that just building clothing,
02:16:04.20 --> 02:16:05.28 is like his jam.
02:16:05.28 --> 02:16:05.80 He loves it.
02:16:05.80 --> 02:16:06.64 Yeah.
02:16:08.92 --> 02:16:11.84 So you say this here, Kipfokx, one of the original founders
02:16:11.84 --> 02:16:15.12 of Under Armor in a good friend of mine was there with me.
02:16:15.12 --> 02:16:16.88 And he was the one who had given me this opportunity
02:16:16.88 --> 02:16:19.48 at San Carlos as I headed out to the best elk country
02:16:19.48 --> 02:16:21.08 in the world for two solid weeks.
02:16:21.08 --> 02:16:24.16 If need be, I was confident.
02:16:24.16 --> 02:16:26.48 But to think I'd even get a chance at a once in a lifetime
02:16:26.48 --> 02:16:28.28 bull like this seemed completely far fetched.
02:16:28.28 --> 02:16:29.08 So you're out.
02:16:29.08 --> 02:16:30.48 They identified, do they?
02:16:30.48 --> 02:16:33.64 They tell you, hey, we got a bull here that you might be,
02:16:33.64 --> 02:16:35.20 because they're scouting bulls all the time.
02:16:35.20 --> 02:16:36.04 Yeah.
02:16:36.04 --> 02:16:37.88 And they find a 400-inch bull.
02:16:37.88 --> 02:16:40.64 What if that's their estimation?
02:16:40.64 --> 02:16:42.32 It's a 10 by 9.
02:16:42.32 --> 02:16:42.92 Yeah.
02:16:42.92 --> 02:16:44.000 That was crazy.
02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:45.04 That's insane.
02:16:45.04 --> 02:16:46.24 That was, yeah.
02:16:46.24 --> 02:16:50.96 And you nickname or they nickname the bull type bull,
02:16:50.96 --> 02:16:53.96 because you have like a narrow rack with 10 by 9, but narrow.
02:16:56.40 --> 02:16:59.80 So again, you go through some of the details here.
02:16:59.80 --> 02:17:00.60 I'm going to pick it up.
02:17:00.60 --> 02:17:01.80 You got a guide name, Chris.
02:17:01.80 --> 02:17:04.68 Chris and Kip were behind me over a little spine
02:17:04.68 --> 02:17:06.48 ridge about 40 yards away.
02:17:06.48 --> 02:17:08.16 All good so far.
02:17:08.16 --> 02:17:12.28 The still unseen bull screamed a bugle.
02:17:12.28 --> 02:17:15.92 And by the way, right now, go on to YouTube and Google,
02:17:15.92 --> 02:17:22.28 bull, elk, bugling and crank up the volume and then press play.
02:17:22.28 --> 02:17:23.20 Yeah.
02:17:23.20 --> 02:17:27.52 Because it is freaking primal insanity.
02:17:27.52 --> 02:17:27.88 Yeah.
02:17:27.88 --> 02:17:29.16 You hear those things going off?
02:17:29.16 --> 02:17:30.48 It is.
02:17:30.48 --> 02:17:33.88 So the still unseen bull screamed a bugle.
02:17:33.88 --> 02:17:34.84 He was close.
02:17:34.84 --> 02:17:37.20 I estimated where he'd come out of the timber
02:17:37.20 --> 02:17:38.68 and looked for shooting lanes.
02:17:38.68 --> 02:17:39.84 It was a mess.
02:17:39.84 --> 02:17:43.16 The burn had burnt trees and brush everywhere.
02:17:43.16 --> 02:17:45.76 I got nervous that once he entered the burn,
02:17:45.76 --> 02:17:47.44 I wouldn't have a clear shot.
02:17:47.44 --> 02:17:49.28 I had seconds to make a decisions.
02:17:49.28 --> 02:17:52.24 At the moment of truth, a bow hunter makes certain decisions
02:17:52.24 --> 02:17:54.24 that impact success or failure.
02:17:54.24 --> 02:17:56.84 The line between the two is razor thin.
02:17:56.84 --> 02:17:58.08 I glanced at the tree.
02:17:58.08 --> 02:18:01.28 I was leaning against a notice some good limbs to climb.
02:18:01.28 --> 02:18:05.68 I quickly surmised that I'd increase my potential shot opportunities
02:18:05.68 --> 02:18:07.56 if I climbed up the tree.
02:18:07.56 --> 02:18:11.12 Since I had been set up on the shady side of the tree,
02:18:11.12 --> 02:18:14.76 my movement would be much less noticeable in the shadows.
02:18:14.76 --> 02:18:17.08 Scaling the tree is quickly as I could.
02:18:17.08 --> 02:18:21.48 I climbed 10 to 15 feet up in the air and set up to shoot.
02:18:21.48 --> 02:18:25.48 This elevated position opened to my shooting lanes greatly.
02:18:25.48 --> 02:18:28.000 Seconds after getting set in the tree,
02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:32.36 the bull ripped the bugle, answering Chris and exposing himself.
02:18:32.36 --> 02:18:35.88 It was tight bull 30 yards away.
02:18:35.88 --> 02:18:40.80 While we were in his country, we had no idea he was the bull coming in.
02:18:40.80 --> 02:18:45.12 I took one quick look at his 400 inch 10 by 9 rack,
02:18:45.12 --> 02:18:48.36 recognized what bull he was and directed my focus
02:18:48.36 --> 02:18:51.36 on getting a good arrow in him.
02:18:51.36 --> 02:18:54.72 Chris cow called the tight and tight bull closed in,
02:18:54.72 --> 02:18:59.12 heading straight toward me and ultimately stopped directly underneath me.
02:18:59.12 --> 02:19:01.84 I slowly eased my bow back.
02:19:01.84 --> 02:19:04.64 The bull noticed movement or sensed or heard me
02:19:04.64 --> 02:19:07.92 probably thinking mountain lion if you could vast him
02:19:07.92 --> 02:19:11.16 and he became spooked running back toward the timber.
02:19:11.16 --> 02:19:13.36 He stopped at just under 30 yards,
02:19:13.36 --> 02:19:16.96 quartering away as I frantically tried to get position to shoot
02:19:16.96 --> 02:19:22.24 while balancing on a burt tree limb 15 feet up.
02:19:22.24 --> 02:19:25.04 When tight bull stood, staring back at me,
02:19:25.04 --> 02:19:28.88 trying to piece together what was happening.
02:19:28.88 --> 02:19:30.72 I had to act fast.
02:19:30.72 --> 02:19:33.64 My sight was set on 30 yards, which would work.
02:19:33.64 --> 02:19:37.52 So I quickly re-adjusted while trying to stay calm.
02:19:37.52 --> 02:19:40.04 I settled my sight pin on his vitals,
02:19:40.04 --> 02:19:42.60 but there was one small limb covering his chest
02:19:42.60 --> 02:19:47.52 so I raised up on my tiptoes in the tree and picked a spot.
02:19:47.52 --> 02:19:49.24 It was crunch time.
02:19:49.24 --> 02:19:52.72 For a bow hunter, this is the most critical moment to master
02:19:52.72 --> 02:19:56.52 as adrenaline speeds through your body and your heart races.
02:19:56.52 --> 02:20:00.04 If you can't remain under control, success will be tough.
02:20:00.04 --> 02:20:02.28 If you can, releasing a perfect arrow
02:20:02.28 --> 02:20:04.28 is just another part of the process.
02:20:04.28 --> 02:20:07.64 If you put in the work, you'll crave crunch time
02:20:07.64 --> 02:20:09.92 because it's your chance to shine.
02:20:09.92 --> 02:20:13.44 Bend that bow back anchor in, pick a spot,
02:20:13.44 --> 02:20:17.000 and send a razor sharp broad head on its way.
02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:20.44 The arrow flashes toward the bull and lands home
02:20:20.44 --> 02:20:23.72 as you knew it would because you've worked too hard to fail.
02:20:23.72 --> 02:20:27.08 After following a short blood trail, you find your bull
02:20:27.08 --> 02:20:29.80 and respectfully kneel by the amazing animal
02:20:29.80 --> 02:20:31.80 that gave its life to you.
02:20:31.80 --> 02:20:33.96 The bull's memory would be celebrated
02:20:33.96 --> 02:20:36.56 when his antlers eventually adorned your wall
02:20:36.56 --> 02:20:38.64 and his flesh nourished you.
02:20:39.92 --> 02:20:44.92 I quickly let an arrow go toward the biggest bull I'd ever seen.
02:20:44.92 --> 02:20:47.60 I felt confident in the shot on release,
02:20:47.60 --> 02:20:49.76 confident about the work I put in,
02:20:49.76 --> 02:20:53.96 confident the arrow would strike where I'd visualized it would perfect.
02:20:55.68 --> 02:20:58.16 But that's not what happened.
02:20:58.16 --> 02:21:00.76 The arrow flew off the mark hitting the bull,
02:21:00.76 --> 02:21:04.96 high into the right striking the top of his shoulder blade.
02:21:04.96 --> 02:21:08.76 A high 24, far-forward shot is about the worst shot
02:21:08.76 --> 02:21:12.08 you can make on a big bull since it's high and forward
02:21:12.08 --> 02:21:15.80 of the lungs, which is where you want the arrow to hit.
02:21:15.80 --> 02:21:18.68 The bull is protected by heavy muscle and bone,
02:21:18.68 --> 02:21:22.08 so an arrow that strikes here will typically only wound the bull
02:21:22.08 --> 02:21:23.64 and not cause death.
02:21:23.64 --> 02:21:27.88 I felt sick to my stomach as a ran over the ridge
02:21:27.88 --> 02:21:31.68 with what looked like half my arrow sticking out of his shoulder.
02:21:31.68 --> 02:21:35.72 How did I blow an opportunity I'd worked my entire adult life
02:21:35.72 --> 02:21:36.92 preparing for?
02:21:36.92 --> 02:21:40.44 My dream became a nightmare in the fraction of a second.
02:21:40.44 --> 02:21:44.64 It took my arrow to leave my bull and hit the bull.
02:21:44.64 --> 02:21:49.64 That was rough.
02:21:49.64 --> 02:21:52.64 That is a savage game right there.
02:21:52.64 --> 02:21:56.64 Yeah, I mean, so it was 30 yards away.
02:21:56.64 --> 02:21:59.64 Yeah, just under 30.
02:21:59.64 --> 02:22:10.64 I feel like if I needed to like place a bet with my own life,
02:22:10.64 --> 02:22:15.64 then you hitting a target at 30 yards,
02:22:15.64 --> 02:22:18.64 I'd feel so comfortable when you take a shot.
02:22:18.64 --> 02:22:21.64 I mean, this is what you do.
02:22:21.64 --> 02:22:23.64 This is what you live for.
02:22:23.64 --> 02:22:24.64 Yeah.
02:22:24.64 --> 02:22:28.64 And that's what makes this freaking this game so crazy.
02:22:28.64 --> 02:22:30.64 Yeah, it's so tough.
02:22:30.64 --> 02:22:34.64 Being up in the tree was a different,
02:22:34.64 --> 02:22:36.64 had some different factors in it.
02:22:36.64 --> 02:22:39.64 Having that limb come across where,
02:22:39.64 --> 02:22:42.64 you don't, you're the sight that you're looking at,
02:22:42.64 --> 02:22:44.64 the line of sight you're looking at,
02:22:44.64 --> 02:22:46.64 your arrow is below that.
02:22:46.64 --> 02:22:48.64 So trying to figure out where your arrow is,
02:22:48.64 --> 02:22:50.64 and this is going to cross into your line of sight,
02:22:50.64 --> 02:22:51.64 and then hit the animal.
02:22:51.64 --> 02:22:53.64 It's going to cross into your line of sight,
02:22:53.64 --> 02:22:55.64 go above your line of sight and draw.
02:22:55.64 --> 02:22:57.64 And then because I've learned that before,
02:22:57.64 --> 02:23:00.64 where I've hit tree branches that were above my line of sight,
02:23:00.64 --> 02:23:01.64 exactly.
02:23:01.64 --> 02:23:03.64 So trying to anticipate that,
02:23:03.64 --> 02:23:05.64 because I didn't know that bull was going to come underneath me,
02:23:05.64 --> 02:23:07.64 and then spook and be there and have that limb there.
02:23:07.64 --> 02:23:09.64 And I didn't know any of that was happening.
02:23:09.64 --> 02:23:12.64 So having to try to calculate all that in the heat of the moment,
02:23:12.64 --> 02:23:14.64 as a bull stand in there,
02:23:14.64 --> 02:23:16.64 you know, nostrils flare and eyes wide,
02:23:16.64 --> 02:23:20.64 figuring out, thought it's just going to get jumped on by a lion.
02:23:20.64 --> 02:23:22.64 And I'm like, here's the bull.
02:23:22.64 --> 02:23:24.64 This is a bull we've been looking for,
02:23:24.64 --> 02:23:27.64 the tight bull, the 10 by 9, the 400 inches is it.
02:23:27.64 --> 02:23:29.64 And then you do the best you can,
02:23:29.64 --> 02:23:32.64 and I screwed up.
02:23:32.64 --> 02:23:35.64 It just, it wasn't my best shot.
02:23:35.64 --> 02:23:38.64 And with all those factors in there,
02:23:38.64 --> 02:23:43.64 is that did I do the best of those options?
02:23:43.64 --> 02:23:46.64 Maybe, but it didn't help us,
02:23:46.64 --> 02:23:49.64 because Arrow was the arrow ended up going in,
02:23:49.64 --> 02:23:53.64 breaking off, and then I had 13 inches of arrow that had,
02:23:53.64 --> 02:23:55.64 where broke off, there's a little blood on the shaft.
02:23:55.64 --> 02:23:57.64 So 13 inches.
02:23:57.64 --> 02:23:59.64 And, you know,
02:23:59.64 --> 02:24:02.64 the last thing you want to do there,
02:24:02.64 --> 02:24:04.64 when you're getting to once in a lifetime opportunity,
02:24:04.64 --> 02:24:06.64 it's your first opportunity there,
02:24:06.64 --> 02:24:09.64 the hunt that country is woundable.
02:24:09.64 --> 02:24:11.64 Because on a hunt like that,
02:24:11.64 --> 02:24:13.64 and any hunt, even at, you know,
02:24:13.64 --> 02:24:15.64 like where you've been and you taught,
02:24:15.64 --> 02:24:18.64 if you draw blood, no matter where you hit the animal,
02:24:18.64 --> 02:24:20.64 that's your animal.
02:24:20.64 --> 02:24:23.64 So, if I wound this bull,
02:24:23.64 --> 02:24:26.64 and even if it doesn't die,
02:24:26.64 --> 02:24:28.64 I'm paying for it.
02:24:28.64 --> 02:24:30.64 70 grand.
02:24:30.64 --> 02:24:32.64 So you end you wounded the animal.
02:24:32.64 --> 02:24:36.64 I mean, the worst, because I put money aside,
02:24:36.64 --> 02:24:39.64 I put that much pressure on myself anyway.
02:24:39.64 --> 02:24:40.64 This is what I do.
02:24:40.64 --> 02:24:42.64 It's what I've geared my whole life for.
02:24:42.64 --> 02:24:45.64 So, even if it was $1 or $7 million,
02:24:45.64 --> 02:24:47.64 I wouldn't have any more pressure.
02:24:47.64 --> 02:24:51.64 It's still like, all this is my purpose.
02:24:51.64 --> 02:24:54.64 But the money, when you're thinking about your family
02:24:54.64 --> 02:24:57.64 and the sacrifices they've made for this,
02:24:57.64 --> 02:25:00.64 then that just makes a worse.
02:25:00.64 --> 02:25:03.64 And just so everybody knows,
02:25:03.64 --> 02:25:07.64 elk are not human beings, obviously.
02:25:07.64 --> 02:25:10.64 But if the reason I say that is because
02:25:10.64 --> 02:25:12.64 they're so freaking tough.
02:25:12.64 --> 02:25:13.64 Yes.
02:25:13.64 --> 02:25:17.64 Like you put a 13, you put a broad head into a human being.
02:25:17.64 --> 02:25:19.64 13 inches, they're gonna die.
02:25:19.64 --> 02:25:20.64 Yeah.
02:25:20.64 --> 02:25:21.64 Like anywhere in their torso,
02:25:21.64 --> 02:25:22.64 they're gonna freak and die.
02:25:22.64 --> 02:25:23.64 Right.
02:25:23.64 --> 02:25:25.64 Especially what I mean, maybe if you get a massage or something.
02:25:25.64 --> 02:25:29.64 But elk, they're crazy.
02:25:29.64 --> 02:25:30.64 They're gonna be tough.
02:25:30.64 --> 02:25:31.64 What they can survive.
02:25:31.64 --> 02:25:32.64 Yeah.
02:25:32.64 --> 02:25:33.64 No.
02:25:33.64 --> 02:25:36.64 I mean, imagine how tough you would be if you slept outside for 365 days a year
02:25:36.64 --> 02:25:39.64 on rock and dirt and weather.
02:25:39.64 --> 02:25:40.64 Yeah.
02:25:40.64 --> 02:25:42.64 And then in order to get a girlfriend,
02:25:42.64 --> 02:25:45.64 you had to freaking go and ram heads fight
02:25:45.64 --> 02:25:48.64 like a bunch of other dudes that had giant
02:25:48.64 --> 02:25:50.64 spears coming out of their head.
02:25:50.64 --> 02:25:51.64 Right.
02:25:51.64 --> 02:25:52.64 Right.
02:25:52.64 --> 02:25:54.64 So it's like they're built for that.
02:25:54.64 --> 02:25:57.64 They're built to endure whatever.
02:25:57.64 --> 02:25:59.64 And arrow, if it's not perfect.
02:25:59.64 --> 02:26:00.64 Yeah.
02:26:00.64 --> 02:26:01.64 It's gonna wound them.
02:26:01.64 --> 02:26:04.64 They're, it's probably gonna, I don't know how they feel pain,
02:26:04.64 --> 02:26:07.64 but they're gonna, they can get a long way.
02:26:07.64 --> 02:26:09.64 They can go long ways survive a long time.
02:26:09.64 --> 02:26:11.64 And they get stabbed with, yeah,
02:26:11.64 --> 02:26:12.64 failures.
02:26:12.64 --> 02:26:13.64 Yeah.
02:26:13.64 --> 02:26:14.64 They get stabbed with antlers.
02:26:14.64 --> 02:26:16.64 So this is sort of like a bad antler wound.
02:26:16.64 --> 02:26:17.64 But that's what they deal with.
02:26:17.64 --> 02:26:19.64 That's what they can actually cleaner.
02:26:19.64 --> 02:26:20.64 You know, like I said.
02:26:20.64 --> 02:26:22.64 So the right head is a cleaner cut.
02:26:22.64 --> 02:26:26.64 And you know, you know how a clean cut can heal.
02:26:26.64 --> 02:26:27.64 Right.
02:26:27.64 --> 02:26:29.64 You know, so a puncture is,
02:26:29.64 --> 02:26:32.64 is one of the worst things you can get for an injury.
02:26:32.64 --> 02:26:34.64 So an antler puncturing.
02:26:34.64 --> 02:26:35.64 Yeah.
02:26:35.64 --> 02:26:40.64 I mean, they could overcome a point as they could overcome an arrow wound.
02:26:40.64 --> 02:26:41.64 And they do all the time.
02:26:41.64 --> 02:26:42.64 Yeah.
02:26:42.64 --> 02:26:43.64 Yeah.
02:26:45.64 --> 02:26:47.64 Going back to the book,
02:26:47.64 --> 02:26:50.64 the type bowl was a regal animal I respected greatly,
02:26:50.64 --> 02:26:53.64 but I failed to deliver the perfect shot.
02:26:53.64 --> 02:26:56.64 I fucked up the shot from less than 30 yards.
02:26:56.64 --> 02:27:02.64 I climbed down the burnt tree and slipped off my boots with just socks on my feet
02:27:02.64 --> 02:27:04.64 and not hard-sold boots.
02:27:04.64 --> 02:27:07.64 I could feel the ground better, which would allow me to sneak forward silently
02:27:07.64 --> 02:27:11.64 and see what kind of blood I had to track.
02:27:11.64 --> 02:27:13.64 As I followed the sparse blood trail,
02:27:13.64 --> 02:27:14.64 my fears were confirmed.
02:27:14.64 --> 02:27:17.64 The bull didn't bleed much at all a few drops,
02:27:17.64 --> 02:27:21.64 which is what you'd expect given that shitty shot.
02:27:21.64 --> 02:27:26.64 Eventually, the light blood trail stopped all together.
02:27:26.64 --> 02:27:29.64 I was devastated, not only did I let myself down
02:27:29.64 --> 02:27:32.64 and my family and friends and followers,
02:27:32.64 --> 02:27:35.64 but I felt like I let the Apache tribe down as well.
02:27:35.64 --> 02:27:38.64 This bull was so unique and so incredible
02:27:38.64 --> 02:27:40.64 and I had made a poor shot on him.
02:27:40.64 --> 02:27:41.64 He deserved better.
02:27:41.64 --> 02:27:45.64 Now I had to go and tell the head of hunting for the tribe
02:27:45.64 --> 02:27:47.64 that I had made a poor shot.
02:27:47.64 --> 02:27:52.64 Kip, Chris and I hiked miles back to the truck.
02:27:52.64 --> 02:27:54.64 Nobody said much.
02:27:54.64 --> 02:27:57.64 I shook my head and started at the stairs at the ground.
02:27:57.64 --> 02:27:59.64 I pit my stomach.
02:27:59.64 --> 02:28:01.64 Yeah.
02:28:01.64 --> 02:28:03.64 It's a bad feeling.
02:28:03.64 --> 02:28:05.64 Dude.
02:28:05.64 --> 02:28:07.64 This is like,
02:28:07.64 --> 02:28:10.64 about hands are sweating right now.
02:28:10.64 --> 02:28:11.64 Yeah.
02:28:11.64 --> 02:28:14.64 You know, and like I said, I mean, obviously,
02:28:14.64 --> 02:28:17.64 I'm like a complete amateur in this game,
02:28:17.64 --> 02:28:24.64 but even when I put myself into your shoes as much of a perfectionist as you are,
02:28:24.64 --> 02:28:29.64 and as much as I know you want to get the good shot
02:28:29.64 --> 02:28:31.64 and then hear you are.
02:28:31.64 --> 02:28:36.64 That's what I could say about being in the camps that I've been in.
02:28:36.64 --> 02:28:39.64 Everybody knows exactly what just happened.
02:28:39.64 --> 02:28:42.64 Like everyone knows there's no hiding.
02:28:42.64 --> 02:28:45.64 Yeah.
02:28:45.64 --> 02:28:48.64 It's just a, you know, you want to make a good shot.
02:28:48.64 --> 02:28:51.64 You want to do your job, essentially.
02:28:51.64 --> 02:28:54.64 And your job is to be,
02:28:54.64 --> 02:28:58.64 build a vermursifl kill of the target animal.
02:28:58.64 --> 02:29:03.64 So anything other than doing your job is tough,
02:29:03.64 --> 02:29:06.64 especially in that circumstance.
02:29:06.64 --> 02:29:09.64 Yeah, that's my first opportunity to show
02:29:09.64 --> 02:29:12.64 you know what I was capable of in that environment in front of that,
02:29:12.64 --> 02:29:14.64 the tribe and,
02:29:14.64 --> 02:29:17.64 had been feel good.
02:29:17.64 --> 02:29:19.64 I want to freaking rough game.
02:29:19.64 --> 02:29:21.64 Yeah.
02:29:21.64 --> 02:29:25.64 Yeah, I remember the first, the first time I shot a bowl,
02:29:25.64 --> 02:29:28.64 I shot a shitty shot.
02:29:28.64 --> 02:29:31.64 Heated in the leg,
02:29:31.64 --> 02:29:34.64 luckily hit an artery,
02:29:34.64 --> 02:29:35.64 but,
02:29:35.64 --> 02:29:40.64 you know,
02:29:40.64 --> 02:29:43.64 Dudley and I attracted until dark.
02:29:43.64 --> 02:29:45.64 We still didn't find it.
02:29:45.64 --> 02:29:46.64 We're walking back.
02:29:46.64 --> 02:29:50.64 I mean, I just, I feel absolutely like,
02:29:50.64 --> 02:29:52.64 horrible and I feel like horrible because I wounded this animal.
02:29:52.64 --> 02:29:54.64 I feel horrible because I let Dudley down,
02:29:54.64 --> 02:29:58.64 who like invested time and effort into me to,
02:29:58.64 --> 02:30:02.64 to give me this opportunity to do this.
02:30:02.64 --> 02:30:05.64 And on top of that quite frankly,
02:30:05.64 --> 02:30:08.64 I didn't even understand that this happened.
02:30:08.64 --> 02:30:12.64 I thought I was like the only person
02:30:12.64 --> 02:30:14.64 that this had ever happened.
02:30:14.64 --> 02:30:16.64 And that's why when I got back to camp,
02:30:16.64 --> 02:30:19.64 I sat down with you and Dudley and Joe
02:30:19.64 --> 02:30:21.64 and we're kind of sitting there eating.
02:30:21.64 --> 02:30:24.64 And you must have just looked at my face.
02:30:24.64 --> 02:30:26.64 It felt like you better like helped me.
02:30:26.64 --> 02:30:27.64 Well,
02:30:27.64 --> 02:30:32.64 because, and you basically told me like a couple stories
02:30:32.64 --> 02:30:35.64 and you were like, hey man, you know, like, this happens.
02:30:35.64 --> 02:30:37.64 And you know,
02:30:37.64 --> 02:30:39.64 and it does.
02:30:39.64 --> 02:30:41.64 And you know, you talked to the guides up there
02:30:41.64 --> 02:30:43.64 and it's, you know,
02:30:43.64 --> 02:30:47.64 there's a decent, it's hard to kill an elk with one shot
02:30:47.64 --> 02:30:49.64 and it happens instantly.
02:30:49.64 --> 02:30:50.64 That's a tough shot.
02:30:50.64 --> 02:30:51.64 Yeah.
02:30:51.64 --> 02:30:54.64 It's like one of those things though that,
02:30:54.64 --> 02:30:56.64 nobody wants to talk about really,
02:30:56.64 --> 02:30:58.64 but it does happen.
02:30:58.64 --> 02:31:00.64 And it's like, you know,
02:31:00.64 --> 02:31:02.64 mean Roy, we'd call each other on the phone
02:31:02.64 --> 02:31:06.64 and it'd be like, how the hunt go, did you kill?
02:31:06.64 --> 02:31:08.64 There's only one of two answers.
02:31:08.64 --> 02:31:11.64 Nobody gives a shit about anything else
02:31:11.64 --> 02:31:13.64 than yes or no.
02:31:13.64 --> 02:31:16.64 So, in a, in a hunting camp setting like that,
02:31:16.64 --> 02:31:17.64 yes, it happens.
02:31:17.64 --> 02:31:19.64 But like, I know how the guides talk
02:31:19.64 --> 02:31:22.64 and how just, not there specifically,
02:31:22.64 --> 02:31:23.64 but just anywhere.
02:31:23.64 --> 02:31:26.64 And it's like how that would be summed up
02:31:26.64 --> 02:31:28.64 would be like, you know,
02:31:28.64 --> 02:31:30.64 camp wounded.
02:31:30.64 --> 02:31:33.64 Nobody needs anything else,
02:31:33.64 --> 02:31:34.64 doesn't fucking matter.
02:31:34.64 --> 02:31:36.64 Did you kill?
02:31:36.64 --> 02:31:38.64 No, you wounded.
02:31:38.64 --> 02:31:40.64 Yeah.
02:31:40.64 --> 02:31:42.64 That all that you can justify,
02:31:42.64 --> 02:31:44.64 you can explain,
02:31:44.64 --> 02:31:45.64 it doesn't matter.
02:31:45.64 --> 02:31:48.64 So it's like, just summed up,
02:31:48.64 --> 02:31:50.64 like no matter how, how people talk
02:31:50.64 --> 02:31:52.64 or make you feel better or whatever.
02:31:52.64 --> 02:31:55.64 It doesn't really help.
02:31:55.64 --> 02:31:57.64 And that's why this, this game is,
02:31:57.64 --> 02:31:59.64 is freaking challenging.
02:31:59.64 --> 02:32:00.64 Yeah.
02:32:00.64 --> 02:32:01.64 And, but here's the thing,
02:32:01.64 --> 02:32:02.64 that's why it's so rewarding.
02:32:02.64 --> 02:32:03.64 Yeah.
02:32:03.64 --> 02:32:04.64 You know, and so I,
02:32:04.64 --> 02:32:06.64 I probably sound pretty negative right now
02:32:06.64 --> 02:32:07.64 because it is hard as hell,
02:32:07.64 --> 02:32:09.64 but that's what makes it so rewarding.
02:32:09.64 --> 02:32:10.64 Yeah.
02:32:10.64 --> 02:32:11.64 That's what makes it so awesome.
02:32:11.64 --> 02:32:14.64 When you pull it off and you get it done.
02:32:14.64 --> 02:32:16.64 So.
02:32:16.64 --> 02:32:17.64 Yeah.
02:32:17.64 --> 02:32:19.64 Ah.
02:32:19.64 --> 02:32:21.64 Going back to the book here.
02:32:21.64 --> 02:32:23.64 Before we're going to bed that night,
02:32:23.64 --> 02:32:24.64 Kippin' I talked about typo,
02:32:24.64 --> 02:32:26.64 what do you think the odds are
02:32:26.64 --> 02:32:27.64 that we're going to get him,
02:32:27.64 --> 02:32:29.64 Kippin' past 20% I said.
02:32:29.64 --> 02:32:30.64 It's not good.
02:32:30.64 --> 02:32:32.64 A high shoulder shot on a big bull,
02:32:32.64 --> 02:32:34.64 like that, I fucked up.
02:32:34.64 --> 02:32:36.64 Well, shit, he muttered.
02:32:36.64 --> 02:32:38.64 I had a hard time sleeping even for a second
02:32:38.64 --> 02:32:39.64 that night,
02:32:39.64 --> 02:32:40.64 and it wasn't the first time.
02:32:40.64 --> 02:32:43.64 I've had heartbreak in the mountains.
02:32:43.64 --> 02:32:45.64 I remember more than once
02:32:45.64 --> 02:32:46.64 blowing it on a big bull,
02:32:46.64 --> 02:32:48.64 times when I should have gotten a kill
02:32:48.64 --> 02:32:50.64 and screwed it up.
02:32:50.64 --> 02:32:52.64 And it has haunted me.
02:32:52.64 --> 02:32:55.64 Crushed me.
02:32:55.64 --> 02:32:57.64 The next morning we got up and headed out
02:32:57.64 --> 02:33:00.64 at first light to where I hit the tight bull.
02:33:00.64 --> 02:33:02.64 Mark and Dan Stevens, Chris's uncle,
02:33:02.64 --> 02:33:04.64 and cousin joined us to lend a hand
02:33:04.64 --> 02:33:05.64 if need be.
02:33:05.64 --> 02:33:06.64 We all walked to a ridge line
02:33:06.64 --> 02:33:09.64 a mile or more away from where I had shot the bull.
02:33:09.64 --> 02:33:11.64 As I scanned across the canyon with my optics,
02:33:11.64 --> 02:33:13.64 I spotted something that I couldn't make out.
02:33:13.64 --> 02:33:14.64 What am I looking at?
02:33:14.64 --> 02:33:15.64 I asked the guys,
02:33:15.64 --> 02:33:17.64 by those yellow quaking asspins
02:33:17.64 --> 02:33:19.64 to the bottom left of them.
02:33:19.64 --> 02:33:20.64 What am I seeing?
02:33:20.64 --> 02:33:22.64 That's your bull, Chris said.
02:33:22.64 --> 02:33:23.64 He was bedded.
02:33:23.64 --> 02:33:26.64 I studied intently through my binos
02:33:26.64 --> 02:33:29.64 and I didn't see a move.
02:33:29.64 --> 02:33:30.64 Is he dead?
02:33:30.64 --> 02:33:32.64 I asked Chris Cow called
02:33:32.64 --> 02:33:33.64 and right when he did,
02:33:33.64 --> 02:33:34.64 the bull moved his head.
02:33:34.64 --> 02:33:35.64 Fuck.
02:33:35.64 --> 02:33:37.64 He's not dead,
02:33:37.64 --> 02:33:38.64 but he's hurt.
02:33:38.64 --> 02:33:39.64 All right, I told him.
02:33:39.64 --> 02:33:42.64 Let me go down and get this mess cleaned up.
02:33:42.64 --> 02:33:43.64 As they stayed there,
02:33:43.64 --> 02:33:44.64 I made a big circle around
02:33:44.64 --> 02:33:46.64 to the other side of the canyon
02:33:46.64 --> 02:33:47.64 where typo was bedded.
02:33:47.64 --> 02:33:49.64 It took me over an hour, maybe even two hours,
02:33:49.64 --> 02:33:51.64 as I wasn't taking any chances with the wind
02:33:51.64 --> 02:33:53.64 and went very wide.
02:33:53.64 --> 02:33:56.64 When I was a couple hundred yards
02:33:56.64 --> 02:33:58.64 from the three quakes,
02:33:58.64 --> 02:33:59.64 which were my landmarks,
02:33:59.64 --> 02:34:00.64 I slipped off my boots
02:34:00.64 --> 02:34:01.64 and continued on slowly
02:34:01.64 --> 02:34:03.64 and silently and just my socks.
02:34:03.64 --> 02:34:04.64 As I neared where typo
02:34:04.64 --> 02:34:05.64 should be,
02:34:05.64 --> 02:34:06.64 I looked through my binoculars
02:34:06.64 --> 02:34:08.64 over to Kit Mark Dan and Chris
02:34:08.64 --> 02:34:10.64 and saw them motioning with their hands.
02:34:10.64 --> 02:34:12.64 With hand signals from a mile away,
02:34:12.64 --> 02:34:13.64 they were telling me
02:34:13.64 --> 02:34:15.64 that the bull was going up the hill.
02:34:15.64 --> 02:34:16.64 When I neared the quakes,
02:34:16.64 --> 02:34:18.64 I spotted him slowly making his way up the hill.
02:34:18.64 --> 02:34:19.64 He was stoved up,
02:34:19.64 --> 02:34:21.64 but I needed to get another arrow
02:34:21.64 --> 02:34:23.64 in him or risk losing him.
02:34:23.64 --> 02:34:25.64 It was going to take a very long bow shot
02:34:25.64 --> 02:34:26.64 to make that happen,
02:34:26.64 --> 02:34:28.64 but I got a good range on him
02:34:28.64 --> 02:34:30.64 and I knew exactly the distance.
02:34:30.64 --> 02:34:32.64 I already had an arrow knock
02:34:32.64 --> 02:34:33.64 so I quickly dialed in my sight
02:34:33.64 --> 02:34:35.64 and drew back my bowstring.
02:34:35.64 --> 02:34:37.64 Settling my pin on his ribs
02:34:37.64 --> 02:34:38.64 as he quartered away,
02:34:38.64 --> 02:34:40.64 he would take a couple extra steps
02:34:40.64 --> 02:34:41.64 and stop, re-gather himself,
02:34:41.64 --> 02:34:43.64 and take another couple extra steps.
02:34:43.64 --> 02:34:45.64 I waited at full draw for him to stop.
02:34:45.64 --> 02:34:47.64 By this time I was completely relaxed
02:34:47.64 --> 02:34:49.64 and felt rock steady.
02:34:49.64 --> 02:34:51.64 Pulling my bow hard against my back wall
02:34:51.64 --> 02:34:52.64 of my draw,
02:34:52.64 --> 02:34:54.64 I cheated the pin up a couple inches
02:34:54.64 --> 02:34:56.64 on his body as he moved
02:34:56.64 --> 02:34:58.64 a yard or two further up the hill
02:34:58.64 --> 02:34:59.64 from when I had ranged him
02:34:59.64 --> 02:35:02.64 and slowly squeezed the trigger of my release.
02:35:02.64 --> 02:35:04.64 The arrow are tied,
02:35:04.64 --> 02:35:05.64 covering the long distance
02:35:05.64 --> 02:35:06.64 before dropping home,
02:35:06.64 --> 02:35:07.64 sinking into his ribs
02:35:07.64 --> 02:35:10.64 as it angled toward the bull's lungs.
02:35:10.64 --> 02:35:12.64 This time my shot was perfect.
02:35:12.64 --> 02:35:13.64 I hustled up the mountain as fast
02:35:13.64 --> 02:35:14.64 as I could in my socks
02:35:14.64 --> 02:35:16.64 knocking in arrows I went.
02:35:16.64 --> 02:35:18.64 He hadn't gone far from where I had hit him
02:35:18.64 --> 02:35:19.64 and those still on his feet
02:35:19.64 --> 02:35:21.64 now his head was down.
02:35:21.64 --> 02:35:24.64 He was quite a poke 92 yards
02:35:24.64 --> 02:35:25.64 but I was in kill mode
02:35:25.64 --> 02:35:27.64 as I came to full draw
02:35:27.64 --> 02:35:30.64 and released again the second long bow shot
02:35:30.64 --> 02:35:31.64 also hit him perfectly.
02:35:31.64 --> 02:35:33.64 The bow went down
02:35:33.64 --> 02:35:34.64 and after a few kicks
02:35:34.64 --> 02:35:35.64 died quickly,
02:35:35.64 --> 02:35:37.64 a wave of relief
02:35:37.64 --> 02:35:39.64 washed over me.
02:35:39.64 --> 02:35:42.64 And then you get to him
02:35:42.64 --> 02:35:44.64 sitting beside the dead tight bull
02:35:44.64 --> 02:35:46.64 was a bittersweet moment of relief.
02:35:46.64 --> 02:35:48.64 My mind was conflicted.
02:35:48.64 --> 02:35:50.64 I had succeeded in achieving my goal
02:35:50.64 --> 02:35:52.64 but knowing I had ended the life
02:35:52.64 --> 02:35:54.64 of a truly majestic animal
02:35:54.64 --> 02:35:56.64 to do so brings a hint of melancholy.
02:35:56.64 --> 02:35:58.64 There was also a solemn sense of pride
02:35:58.64 --> 02:36:00.64 that comes with knowing once the bull hit the ground
02:36:00.64 --> 02:36:02.64 the ending of his life
02:36:02.64 --> 02:36:03.64 would help sustain me
02:36:03.64 --> 02:36:05.64 and my family for months.
02:36:05.64 --> 02:36:08.64 I took a moment to give reverence
02:36:08.64 --> 02:36:10.64 for the life of the animal I killed.
02:36:10.64 --> 02:36:12.64 Thanks for the nourishment beast.
02:36:12.64 --> 02:36:14.64 Your flesh will fuel me
02:36:14.64 --> 02:36:16.64 and your antlers on my wall
02:36:16.64 --> 02:36:19.64 will ensure your life is honored
02:36:19.64 --> 02:36:21.64 as long as I live.
02:36:26.64 --> 02:36:28.64 Got it done.
02:36:28.64 --> 02:36:30.64 And you know,
02:36:30.64 --> 02:36:31.64 there you are
02:36:31.64 --> 02:36:32.64 the next day
02:36:32.64 --> 02:36:35.64 making a shot at 92 yards
02:36:35.64 --> 02:36:36.64 another shot at whatever
02:36:36.64 --> 02:36:38.64 90, probably 94
02:36:38.64 --> 02:36:39.64 95 yards
02:36:39.64 --> 02:36:41.64 both perfect shots.
02:36:41.64 --> 02:36:43.64 Yeah, I think the first one
02:36:43.64 --> 02:36:44.64 was the first one I think was actually
02:36:44.64 --> 02:36:46.64 a hundred and seven.
02:36:46.64 --> 02:36:47.64 And then the second one
02:36:47.64 --> 02:36:49.64 I had snuck up a little bit
02:36:49.64 --> 02:36:51.64 and he didn't go that far
02:36:51.64 --> 02:36:52.64 and so he was 92 in the second
02:36:52.64 --> 02:36:53.64 but the first one was
02:36:53.64 --> 02:36:55.64 a little over a hundred.
02:36:55.64 --> 02:36:56.64 Yeah, and to everybody knows
02:36:56.64 --> 02:36:58.64 like most people want to shoot
02:36:58.64 --> 02:37:00.64 no further than 50 yards.
02:37:00.64 --> 02:37:01.64 Yeah, I would say.
02:37:01.64 --> 02:37:03.64 And I think 40 is really what
02:37:03.64 --> 02:37:05.64 most people feel very confident
02:37:05.64 --> 02:37:06.64 in it.
02:37:06.64 --> 02:37:06.64 Yeah.
02:37:06.64 --> 02:37:08.64 50 is out
02:37:08.64 --> 02:37:10.64 a little bit further, but
02:37:10.64 --> 02:37:11.64 a hundred and seven.
02:37:11.64 --> 02:37:12.64 That's a long shot.
02:37:12.64 --> 02:37:13.64 It's a long shot.
02:37:13.64 --> 02:37:14.64 Yeah.
02:37:14.64 --> 02:37:16.64 I just wanted to get, you know,
02:37:16.64 --> 02:37:19.64 in my head that animal had suffered
02:37:19.64 --> 02:37:20.64 all night.
02:37:20.64 --> 02:37:22.64 And so I wanted to
02:37:22.64 --> 02:37:23.64 just do it.
02:37:23.64 --> 02:37:25.64 I should have done the first time
02:37:25.64 --> 02:37:28.64 and just close a deal.
02:37:28.64 --> 02:37:31.64 It's an interesting parallel
02:37:31.64 --> 02:37:32.64 with you, Jitsu.
02:37:32.64 --> 02:37:33.64 I can Jitsu.
02:37:33.64 --> 02:37:34.64 You go and train and you
02:37:34.64 --> 02:37:36.64 you get tapped out by people
02:37:36.64 --> 02:37:39.64 and you keep coming back.
02:37:39.64 --> 02:37:42.64 And like if you never got tapped out
02:37:42.64 --> 02:37:45.64 it's to me if I never got tapped out
02:37:45.64 --> 02:37:47.64 I would probably not come back as often.
02:37:47.64 --> 02:37:48.64 Right.
02:37:48.64 --> 02:37:51.64 If bow hunting was easy,
02:37:51.64 --> 02:37:53.64 it wouldn't be so rewarding.
02:37:53.64 --> 02:37:54.64 Right.
02:37:54.64 --> 02:37:56.64 It wouldn't be the draw.
02:37:56.64 --> 02:37:57.64 Yeah.
02:37:57.64 --> 02:37:59.64 And it's like if that to me,
02:37:59.64 --> 02:38:00.64 that's the only thing
02:38:00.64 --> 02:38:02.64 the only reason I've ever stood out
02:38:02.64 --> 02:38:03.64 in life.
02:38:03.64 --> 02:38:05.64 So it's like I feel
02:38:05.64 --> 02:38:08.64 this is what I was supposed to be good at.
02:38:08.64 --> 02:38:10.64 This is what I was supposed to do.
02:38:10.64 --> 02:38:11.64 This is my thing.
02:38:11.64 --> 02:38:14.64 So to fail,
02:38:14.64 --> 02:38:17.64 it feels different with to me also.
02:38:17.64 --> 02:38:18.64 Yeah.
02:38:18.64 --> 02:38:19.64 While it's going to say that earlier
02:38:19.64 --> 02:38:20.64 when you were like,
02:38:20.64 --> 02:38:21.64 well, it's a lot of money
02:38:21.64 --> 02:38:22.64 and there's a lot of pressure
02:38:22.64 --> 02:38:25.64 from wanting to do the right thing.
02:38:25.64 --> 02:38:26.64 And I was like, oh,
02:38:26.64 --> 02:38:27.64 end your campaigns.
02:38:27.64 --> 02:38:28.64 Yeah.
02:38:28.64 --> 02:38:29.64 You know,
02:38:29.64 --> 02:38:31.64 like this is,
02:38:31.64 --> 02:38:32.64 you carry,
02:38:32.64 --> 02:38:34.64 it's like when the Gracie family
02:38:34.64 --> 02:38:35.64 is like, you did do.
02:38:35.64 --> 02:38:36.64 Right.
02:38:36.64 --> 02:38:38.64 They're carrying their family name.
02:38:38.64 --> 02:38:39.64 Which is a,
02:38:39.64 --> 02:38:40.64 which is kind of a rough thing.
02:38:40.64 --> 02:38:41.64 Because that's hard.
02:38:41.64 --> 02:38:42.64 When you're,
02:38:42.64 --> 02:38:44.64 the Gracie family's huge.
02:38:44.64 --> 02:38:45.64 And there might be some kid
02:38:45.64 --> 02:38:47.64 that's 14 years old
02:38:47.64 --> 02:38:48.64 that started training two years ago,
02:38:48.64 --> 02:38:50.64 but he's part of the Gracie family.
02:38:50.64 --> 02:38:51.64 Yeah.
02:38:51.64 --> 02:38:52.64 So you have, you know,
02:38:52.64 --> 02:38:53.64 that's your name.
02:38:53.64 --> 02:38:54.64 Right.
02:38:54.64 --> 02:38:55.64 Yeah.
02:38:55.64 --> 02:38:57.64 Yeah.
02:38:57.64 --> 02:38:58.64 So it's,
02:38:58.64 --> 02:38:59.64 they,
02:38:59.64 --> 02:39:00.64 when they,
02:39:00.64 --> 02:39:01.64 they were watching from the
02:39:01.64 --> 02:39:04.64 Ridge, you know, where we first saw the bull.
02:39:04.64 --> 02:39:07.64 And so they said that me making those two shots
02:39:07.64 --> 02:39:08.64 to kill it,
02:39:08.64 --> 02:39:10.64 made out for,
02:39:10.64 --> 02:39:11.64 so that,
02:39:11.64 --> 02:39:13.64 if I'd already let everybody down on it
02:39:13.64 --> 02:39:14.64 and like,
02:39:14.64 --> 02:39:14.64 like,
02:39:14.64 --> 02:39:14.64 it,
02:39:14.64 --> 02:39:14.64 well,
02:39:14.64 --> 02:39:15.64 that got me back to zero.
02:39:15.64 --> 02:39:16.64 That got to level down to get.
02:39:16.64 --> 02:39:17.64 Yeah.
02:39:17.64 --> 02:39:17.64 Yeah.
02:39:17.64 --> 02:39:18.64 Did anybody get video of it?
02:39:18.64 --> 02:39:19.64 No.
02:39:19.64 --> 02:39:20.64 No,
02:39:20.64 --> 02:39:21.64 not from that far.
02:39:21.64 --> 02:39:22.64 Nobody had anything.
02:39:22.64 --> 02:39:23.64 Yeah.
02:39:23.64 --> 02:39:25.64 We haven't never really had a camera crew there.
02:39:25.64 --> 02:39:26.64 Mm-hmm.
02:39:26.64 --> 02:39:27.64 Yeah.
02:39:27.64 --> 02:39:28.64 The camera crew you were talking about
02:39:28.64 --> 02:39:29.64 earlier like that.
02:39:29.64 --> 02:39:30.64 That's another dynamic we're doing.
02:39:30.64 --> 02:39:31.64 Yeah.
02:39:31.64 --> 02:39:32.64 That's a dynamic we're doing this stuff.
02:39:32.64 --> 02:39:33.64 Oh man.
02:39:33.64 --> 02:39:35.64 That must really bother you.
02:39:35.64 --> 02:39:36.64 Yeah.
02:39:36.64 --> 02:39:37.64 I mean,
02:39:37.64 --> 02:39:38.64 I,
02:39:38.64 --> 02:39:39.64 I don't like having with anybody.
02:39:39.64 --> 02:39:40.64 Yeah.
02:39:40.64 --> 02:39:41.64 That's what I'm saying.
02:39:41.64 --> 02:39:42.64 So even on these guided hunts,
02:39:42.64 --> 02:39:43.64 and they,
02:39:43.64 --> 02:39:44.64 they already,
02:39:44.64 --> 02:39:45.64 they all know this,
02:39:45.64 --> 02:39:46.64 but I don't,
02:39:46.64 --> 02:39:47.64 I just want to do it.
02:39:47.64 --> 02:39:48.64 You know,
02:39:48.64 --> 02:39:49.64 I don't need help.
02:39:49.64 --> 02:39:50.64 If I screw up,
02:39:50.64 --> 02:39:51.64 I wanted to be me screwing up.
02:39:51.64 --> 02:39:52.64 But so then,
02:39:52.64 --> 02:39:53.64 then,
02:39:53.64 --> 02:39:54.64 we have a camera man there.
02:39:54.64 --> 02:39:55.64 You know,
02:39:55.64 --> 02:39:56.64 there's always somebody to blame.
02:39:56.64 --> 02:39:57.64 So the camera man,
02:39:57.64 --> 02:39:59.64 it's like the worst job ever.
02:39:59.64 --> 02:40:00.64 There's anything,
02:40:00.64 --> 02:40:01.64 any of the steak,
02:40:01.64 --> 02:40:02.64 it's like,
02:40:02.64 --> 02:40:02.64 you know,
02:40:02.64 --> 02:40:04.64 they saw the camera or they heard you.
02:40:04.64 --> 02:40:05.64 Whatever.
02:40:05.64 --> 02:40:07.64 But when it works out,
02:40:07.64 --> 02:40:08.64 like I've had.
02:40:08.64 --> 02:40:10.64 The camera slash blame guy.
02:40:10.64 --> 02:40:11.64 Yeah. Exactly.
02:40:11.64 --> 02:40:15.64 I've had some hunts that I'm so thankful we have for sure.
02:40:15.64 --> 02:40:16.64 For sure.
02:40:16.64 --> 02:40:16.64 You know,
02:40:16.64 --> 02:40:18.64 but there's that.
02:40:18.64 --> 02:40:20.64 It's kind of rough waters out for a while.
02:40:20.64 --> 02:40:21.64 Yeah.
02:40:21.64 --> 02:40:22.64 To get it done.
02:40:22.64 --> 02:40:23.64 It is pretty,
02:40:23.64 --> 02:40:24.64 I mean,
02:40:24.64 --> 02:40:26.64 I have some good footage from last year.
02:40:26.64 --> 02:40:27.64 Yeah.
02:40:27.64 --> 02:40:29.64 The Dudley was with me.
02:40:29.64 --> 02:40:31.64 Dudley was filming.
02:40:31.64 --> 02:40:32.64 You know,
02:40:32.64 --> 02:40:35.64 I'm probably the only person in the world that gets to have John Dudley as my freaky camera.
02:40:35.64 --> 02:40:37.64 I remember he had already killed and he was like,
02:40:37.64 --> 02:40:37.64 right?
02:40:37.64 --> 02:40:38.64 And, you know,
02:40:38.64 --> 02:40:42.64 he got a freaking good video of the,
02:40:42.64 --> 02:40:43.64 you know,
02:40:43.64 --> 02:40:44.64 the end of this.
02:40:44.64 --> 02:40:46.64 I actually got the set up and everything.
02:40:46.64 --> 02:40:46.64 Yeah.
02:40:46.64 --> 02:40:47.64 And it's,
02:40:47.64 --> 02:40:48.64 and I'm really happy.
02:40:48.64 --> 02:40:50.64 And I will say that like,
02:40:50.64 --> 02:40:51.64 like,
02:40:51.64 --> 02:40:53.64 review and tape for anything.
02:40:53.64 --> 02:40:54.64 Like any sport.
02:40:54.64 --> 02:40:55.64 Yeah.
02:40:55.64 --> 02:40:55.64 You know,
02:40:55.64 --> 02:40:56.64 you can watch and be like,
02:40:56.64 --> 02:40:57.64 yeah,
02:40:57.64 --> 02:40:58.64 yeah,
02:40:58.64 --> 02:40:58.64 yeah,
02:40:58.64 --> 02:40:59.64 yeah.
02:40:59.64 --> 02:40:59.64 No,
02:40:59.64 --> 02:41:00.64 I know.
02:41:00.64 --> 02:41:02.64 I remember I think your shot was it,
02:41:02.64 --> 02:41:04.64 was it a little back at the lungs?
02:41:04.64 --> 02:41:05.64 Yep.
02:41:05.64 --> 02:41:06.64 Like we're at one Earth was liver.
02:41:06.64 --> 02:41:07.64 It was like,
02:41:07.64 --> 02:41:08.64 one long,
02:41:08.64 --> 02:41:09.64 one long and liver.
02:41:09.64 --> 02:41:10.64 Yeah.
02:41:10.64 --> 02:41:11.64 I remember that.
02:41:11.64 --> 02:41:11.64 So that's,
02:41:11.64 --> 02:41:15.64 that is good to know because a lot of times it happens super fast.
02:41:15.64 --> 02:41:16.64 Yep.
02:41:16.64 --> 02:41:19.64 So being able to have that footage to review can actually help in the recovery.
02:41:19.64 --> 02:41:23.64 Right before that,
02:41:23.64 --> 02:41:25.64 I had shot another wolf in Colorado.
02:41:25.64 --> 02:41:27.64 And that one,
02:41:27.64 --> 02:41:35.64 I really would have liked to have that on video because I think you can help me with this.
02:41:35.64 --> 02:41:38.64 So the bowl was at 51 yards.
02:41:38.64 --> 02:41:39.64 Mm.
02:41:39.64 --> 02:41:43.64 And I was on my knees.
02:41:43.64 --> 02:41:45.64 And he was walking,
02:41:45.64 --> 02:41:46.64 you know,
02:41:46.64 --> 02:41:48.64 from right to left.
02:41:48.64 --> 02:41:49.64 And
02:41:49.64 --> 02:41:51.64 ordering away a little bit.
02:41:51.64 --> 02:41:53.64 I don't know what's that called.
02:41:53.64 --> 02:41:54.64 Like anything away or something.
02:41:54.64 --> 02:41:55.64 Like this yeah.
02:41:55.64 --> 02:41:56.64 It's slightly squirming.
02:41:56.64 --> 02:41:57.64 Slightly squirming.
02:41:57.64 --> 02:41:58.64 Slightly squirming.
02:41:58.64 --> 02:42:02.64 And so he's squirming away.
02:42:02.64 --> 02:42:03.64 So I thought okay,
02:42:03.64 --> 02:42:06.64 I'm going to aim a little bit back.
02:42:06.64 --> 02:42:09.64 And then I was waiting for him to stop.
02:42:09.64 --> 02:42:10.64 He stopped.
02:42:10.64 --> 02:42:12.64 And so I,
02:42:12.64 --> 02:42:13.64 you know,
02:42:13.64 --> 02:42:14.64 started letting go.
02:42:14.64 --> 02:42:15.64 My era went.
02:42:15.64 --> 02:42:17.64 And it was like,
02:42:17.64 --> 02:42:19.64 he took a step.
02:42:19.64 --> 02:42:20.64 It was,
02:42:20.64 --> 02:42:21.64 this is what happened.
02:42:21.64 --> 02:42:23.64 He was looking at us.
02:42:23.64 --> 02:42:27.56 So I was waiting for him to look away before I let the arrow go.
02:42:27.56 --> 02:42:29.08 So he started to look away.
02:42:29.08 --> 02:42:31.60 I started pulling back, let the arrow go.
02:42:31.60 --> 02:42:33.16 But he wasn't just looking away.
02:42:33.16 --> 02:42:34.56 He was taking a step.
02:42:34.56 --> 02:42:35.40 Yeah.
02:42:35.40 --> 02:42:38.92 So I hit him further back than I wanted to.
02:42:38.92 --> 02:42:41.40 But in reviewing it in my head, I thought,
02:42:41.40 --> 02:42:45.96 OK, so if I'm going to be aiming at a bull,
02:42:45.96 --> 02:42:47.96 I should cheat a little bit in the direction
02:42:47.96 --> 02:42:49.28 that he might take a step.
02:42:49.28 --> 02:42:50.32 Or is that a bad call?
02:42:50.32 --> 02:42:53.96 We would just go with the stationary.
02:42:53.96 --> 02:42:55.28 Yeah, because you don't know for sure.
02:42:55.28 --> 02:42:57.48 So you don't want to cheat, then they don't take a step.
02:42:57.48 --> 02:43:01.12 And then you overthink it almost.
02:43:01.12 --> 02:43:03.88 Yeah, it's hard to predict what they're going to do.
02:43:03.88 --> 02:43:05.76 I mean, I did recover that bull.
02:43:05.76 --> 02:43:12.56 But it took a while and it took some expert tracking to find.
02:43:12.56 --> 02:43:13.64 Again, I was very lucky.
02:43:13.64 --> 02:43:18.12 Yeah, I had Dudley with me in the guide up there helping out.
02:43:18.12 --> 02:43:19.72 But man, they're tough.
02:43:19.72 --> 02:43:26.24 I mean, he went down and up these three hills.
02:43:26.24 --> 02:43:26.84 Yeah.
02:43:26.84 --> 02:43:30.08 That were not fun.
02:43:30.08 --> 02:43:30.96 He wrote a read.
02:43:30.96 --> 02:43:32.04 They're not fun.
02:43:32.04 --> 02:43:35.56 And he had an arrow freaking sticking in him.
02:43:35.56 --> 02:43:37.16 Yeah.
02:43:37.16 --> 02:43:39.68 Yeah.
02:43:39.68 --> 02:43:42.12 It's a, yeah.
02:43:42.12 --> 02:43:46.36 I think almost, I've seen, you know, I talked about my dad
02:43:46.36 --> 02:43:49.56 or whatever, but I'm sure you guys know that that
02:43:49.56 --> 02:43:54.52 will to live is pretty strong, even for humans.
02:43:54.52 --> 02:43:57.80 We're not as tough as animals, but still, people can really
02:43:57.80 --> 02:43:58.92 hold on.
02:43:58.92 --> 02:44:02.000 And it's like, when that life is leaving, like it's so
02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:07.12 an animal or I say anything, I've heard even people say,
02:44:07.12 --> 02:44:08.16 oh, care, but it's easy.
02:44:08.16 --> 02:44:09.16 They die easy.
02:44:09.16 --> 02:44:10.68 And I'm like, I don't know anything.
02:44:10.68 --> 02:44:12.56 It's a dice easy.
02:44:12.56 --> 02:44:13.88 I don't know anything.
02:44:13.88 --> 02:44:17.92 So especially something as tough as a bull elk.
02:44:17.92 --> 02:44:20.80 It does this born and bred in the mountains.
02:44:20.80 --> 02:44:24.16 It's just like they're will to live, just like any things,
02:44:24.16 --> 02:44:27.92 anything that's alive, there's a will to live.
02:44:27.92 --> 02:44:30.32 That is just incredible.
02:44:30.32 --> 02:44:33.64 And they're freaking, like when you said born in the mountains,
02:44:33.64 --> 02:44:36.28 you see them go up a hill.
02:44:36.28 --> 02:44:36.80 Yeah.
02:44:36.80 --> 02:44:37.80 It's insane.
02:44:37.80 --> 02:44:40.000 No, they'll go up and over a ridge.
02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:41.80 You'll try to do the same thing or take you an hour.
02:44:41.80 --> 02:44:42.32 Yeah.
02:44:42.32 --> 02:44:43.16 And they do it in minutes.
02:44:43.16 --> 02:44:44.000 Yeah.
02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:44.68 It's freaking crazy to watch.
02:44:44.68 --> 02:44:45.48 Yeah.
02:44:45.48 --> 02:44:49.000 They're there. But one thing that humans do have
02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:52.68 over animals, almost any animal other than maybe a wolf,
02:44:52.68 --> 02:44:54.44 is endurance.
02:44:54.44 --> 02:44:57.64 So those bulls can put distance between you and them
02:44:57.64 --> 02:44:58.84 quickly.
02:44:58.84 --> 02:45:02.48 But if you can stay on, it's hard finding country
02:45:02.48 --> 02:45:05.24 that would allow this.
02:45:05.24 --> 02:45:07.40 But that's like an African that's what they do.
02:45:07.40 --> 02:45:09.12 They stay on these animals.
02:45:09.12 --> 02:45:10.000 And then they get it.
02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.08 Animals get exhausted before the humans do.
02:45:12.08 --> 02:45:15.36 So we have endurance, as that's
02:45:15.36 --> 02:45:17.68 our pretty much our only advantage.
02:45:17.68 --> 02:45:18.56 Yeah.
02:45:18.56 --> 02:45:20.88 And I would caveat by saying some humans.
02:45:24.88 --> 02:45:26.04 Maybe not everybody.
02:45:26.04 --> 02:45:27.20 Maybe not the woke ones.
02:45:31.20 --> 02:45:35.52 You got some crazy stories in here.
02:45:35.52 --> 02:45:37.92 Here's a story with Roy in it.
02:45:37.92 --> 02:45:39.76 Roy stared in the face and danger.
02:45:39.76 --> 02:45:41.60 And the face of danger didn't blink.
02:45:41.60 --> 02:45:43.16 This happened during Brown Bear hunt.
02:45:43.16 --> 02:45:46.56 We had gone on earlier in July that year.
02:45:46.56 --> 02:45:50.36 We'd had a big snow, a big sal brown bear that turned into
02:45:50.36 --> 02:45:51.04 a problem.
02:45:51.04 --> 02:45:54.56 She saw us from about 130 yards away and started running full
02:45:54.56 --> 02:45:56.08 speed right at us.
02:45:56.08 --> 02:46:01.24 Roy ready to his three, his dot three, five, seven.
02:46:01.24 --> 02:46:02.52 Gonna get some.
02:46:02.52 --> 02:46:05.96 That he'd brought as backup.
02:46:05.96 --> 02:46:08.28 And I knocked an arrow.
02:46:08.28 --> 02:46:11.24 Not sure what an arrow would do to a charging brown bear.
02:46:11.24 --> 02:46:12.40 But that's all I had.
02:46:12.40 --> 02:46:14.48 Does that say three, five, seven or three, seven, five?
02:46:14.48 --> 02:46:15.68 It says three, seven, five.
02:46:15.68 --> 02:46:16.52 Oh, three, seven, five.
02:46:16.52 --> 02:46:17.16 No, that's right.
02:46:17.16 --> 02:46:17.68 Yeah.
02:46:17.68 --> 02:46:17.68 Yeah.
02:46:17.68 --> 02:46:18.60 No, three, fifty, seven.
02:46:18.60 --> 02:46:20.08 I was like, well, that would be a pistol.
02:46:20.08 --> 02:46:23.04 I was like, I hope that is a three, five, seven.
02:46:23.04 --> 02:46:24.24 Three, seven, five.
02:46:24.24 --> 02:46:24.76 Five, five.
02:46:24.76 --> 02:46:25.64 That's a magnet.
02:46:25.64 --> 02:46:26.96 That's what he had.
02:46:26.96 --> 02:46:27.48 That's a burn.
02:46:27.48 --> 02:46:28.76 They're going to.
02:46:28.76 --> 02:46:33.80 He's Roy said, if she gets to our side of the creek,
02:46:33.80 --> 02:46:34.92 I'm going to have to shoot her.
02:46:34.92 --> 02:46:38.36 She crossed the creek without hesitation and ran toward us.
02:46:38.36 --> 02:46:40.92 At about 20 yards, she stopped and stood up aggressively,
02:46:40.92 --> 02:46:46.20 huffing and staring us down, head rocking side to side.
02:46:46.20 --> 02:46:48.92 We were standing in the wide open in knee high grass,
02:46:48.92 --> 02:46:51.28 so there was no mistake in we were humans.
02:46:51.28 --> 02:46:53.64 We were giving her a chance to make a better decision
02:46:53.64 --> 02:46:56.12 since we didn't want to kill her unless we absolutely had to.
02:46:56.12 --> 02:46:57.84 Get out of here, we hauled.
02:46:57.84 --> 02:46:58.96 It didn't matter.
02:46:58.96 --> 02:47:01.16 The brown bear dropped down.
02:47:01.16 --> 02:47:04.88 And with deadly intentions and ears pinned back,
02:47:04.88 --> 02:47:06.20 she charged.
02:47:06.20 --> 02:47:10.08 Roy fired one shot and stone her at close range.
02:47:10.08 --> 02:47:12.36 Me or feet from us.
02:47:12.36 --> 02:47:14.60 I couldn't help uttering aloud and inappropriate
02:47:14.60 --> 02:47:16.44 cuss word fuck.
02:47:16.44 --> 02:47:19.44 I was mad that we had to kill another bear.
02:47:19.44 --> 02:47:21.32 I had killed a nice bore already,
02:47:21.32 --> 02:47:23.56 and we were on a high after that awesome success
02:47:23.56 --> 02:47:25.92 and sweet footage of my perfect bow shot.
02:47:25.92 --> 02:47:29.52 Now we had killed now we had had another killed,
02:47:29.52 --> 02:47:30.88 which we didn't want.
02:47:30.88 --> 02:47:33.52 Despite the fact that we were in grave danger,
02:47:33.52 --> 02:47:36.08 that aspect never even entered our minds.
02:47:36.08 --> 02:47:38.56 After I cost mad shaking my head,
02:47:38.56 --> 02:47:41.84 Roy said matter of fact, dude, I had to.
02:47:41.84 --> 02:47:44.24 I replied, I know, it just sucks.
02:47:44.24 --> 02:47:45.64 A typical response might have been,
02:47:45.64 --> 02:47:47.20 oh my God, we could have been killed.
02:47:47.20 --> 02:47:48.80 Are you okay? I'm shaking.
02:47:48.80 --> 02:47:51.44 But I knew I had a partner, but I knew the partner I had
02:47:51.44 --> 02:47:52.28 in Roy.
02:47:52.28 --> 02:47:54.60 He shared the same type of confidence I had.
02:47:54.60 --> 02:47:57.28 He was never rattled and always in control.
02:47:57.28 --> 02:47:58.52 I knew in 10 lifetimes,
02:47:58.52 --> 02:48:00.80 I'd never find another partner like Roy.
02:48:00.80 --> 02:48:02.72 Good times.
02:48:02.72 --> 02:48:05.80 Yeah, that was a bummer.
02:48:05.80 --> 02:48:08.80 She had these full grown cobs with her,
02:48:08.80 --> 02:48:10.80 so they'll stick around sometimes.
02:48:10.80 --> 02:48:13.80 They don't need to be with the south,
02:48:13.80 --> 02:48:16.80 but they hang around for a while before they split off.
02:48:16.80 --> 02:48:18.80 So she had those with her,
02:48:18.80 --> 02:48:20.80 and I don't know what it was,
02:48:20.80 --> 02:48:23.80 but I shot this bore,
02:48:23.80 --> 02:48:25.80 and she had heard something.
02:48:25.80 --> 02:48:27.80 I think maybe when the arrow hit,
02:48:27.80 --> 02:48:30.80 and she had heard something, I think maybe when the arrow hit him,
02:48:30.80 --> 02:48:32.80 he made a noise,
02:48:32.80 --> 02:48:34.80 because she had her those full grown cobs,
02:48:34.80 --> 02:48:35.80 and it was a bore,
02:48:35.80 --> 02:48:37.80 boars will kill cobs.
02:48:37.80 --> 02:48:40.80 And so she heard that noise didn't know what,
02:48:40.80 --> 02:48:44.80 so she came over and then smelled blood from my bear.
02:48:44.80 --> 02:48:47.80 Track that blood all the way out to where he died
02:48:47.80 --> 02:48:49.80 and started tearing them up.
02:48:49.80 --> 02:48:53.80 She was attacking them and hair and stuff as you want everywhere.
02:48:53.80 --> 02:48:56.80 And I'm like, I go, dude, she's tearing up my bear.
02:48:56.80 --> 02:48:58.80 And so we're yelling at her,
02:48:58.80 --> 02:49:00.80 and I go, I said shoot out there,
02:49:00.80 --> 02:49:01.80 not to shoot her,
02:49:01.80 --> 02:49:02.80 but just shoot out there,
02:49:02.80 --> 02:49:04.80 spooker, so he shoots nothing.
02:49:04.80 --> 02:49:07.80 And she didn't pay attention.
02:49:07.80 --> 02:49:10.80 Then she turned and looked and she saw us,
02:49:10.80 --> 02:49:12.80 and we're about 130 yards away,
02:49:12.80 --> 02:49:14.80 and she just came just sprinting.
02:49:14.80 --> 02:49:17.80 And it's like a bear, a big brown bear,
02:49:17.80 --> 02:49:19.80 I'd like to sprint into the grass at you,
02:49:19.80 --> 02:49:20.80 it's just like,
02:49:20.80 --> 02:49:22.80 you're knocking up at her,
02:49:22.80 --> 02:49:23.80 yeah, I'm like,
02:49:23.80 --> 02:49:25.80 I don't know what I'll do,
02:49:25.80 --> 02:49:28.80 and so we didn't want to kill her at all.
02:49:28.80 --> 02:49:31.80 And it was just like the biggest downer.
02:49:31.80 --> 02:49:33.80 And even when I was in this video,
02:49:33.80 --> 02:49:35.80 I think it's still on YouTube,
02:49:35.80 --> 02:49:38.80 but I'm sitting there with a bull-eye kill
02:49:38.80 --> 02:49:40.80 and Roy is in the background.
02:49:40.80 --> 02:49:42.80 He's like looking, because those full-grown cubs,
02:49:42.80 --> 02:49:43.80 they're still 400 pounds,
02:49:43.80 --> 02:49:46.80 they're not really cubs, they're yearlings.
02:49:46.80 --> 02:49:49.80 But they're back and forth,
02:49:49.80 --> 02:49:50.80 and he's looking at him,
02:49:50.80 --> 02:49:51.80 he's just shaking his head,
02:49:51.80 --> 02:49:52.80 because it was just,
02:49:52.80 --> 02:49:54.80 you know, they obviously were going to survive.
02:49:54.80 --> 02:49:56.80 They're all going to survive,
02:49:56.80 --> 02:49:58.80 but it was just a downer.
02:49:58.80 --> 02:50:01.80 We're not trying to kill us out, you know?
02:50:01.80 --> 02:50:04.80 And we end up a calling fishing game
02:50:04.80 --> 02:50:06.80 on the satellite phone saying what happened,
02:50:06.80 --> 02:50:08.80 which happens a lot up there.
02:50:08.80 --> 02:50:10.80 It's called defensive life and property.
02:50:10.80 --> 02:50:13.80 You can kill bear if your life's at risk.
02:50:13.80 --> 02:50:15.80 And we had to skin it out and take it back in
02:50:15.80 --> 02:50:17.80 and do the paperwork and do all that.
02:50:17.80 --> 02:50:18.80 So we did all that,
02:50:18.80 --> 02:50:20.80 but it's not that it was,
02:50:20.80 --> 02:50:22.80 you know, legal or anything like that.
02:50:22.80 --> 02:50:25.80 It was all legal, but it's just,
02:50:25.80 --> 02:50:27.80 we just didn't want to have to kill another bear.
02:50:27.80 --> 02:50:31.80 But, yeah, we were in those situations quite often,
02:50:31.80 --> 02:50:32.80 which happens, you know?
02:50:32.80 --> 02:50:35.80 They say, we have a greater chance of,
02:50:35.80 --> 02:50:37.80 who knows what, getting struck by lightning,
02:50:37.80 --> 02:50:39.80 they've been attacked by grizzly.
02:50:39.80 --> 02:50:41.80 Not if you're hunting grizzly all the time.
02:50:41.80 --> 02:50:42.80 If you're hunting grizzly all the time,
02:50:42.80 --> 02:50:44.80 it's like 75% chance.
02:50:44.80 --> 02:50:45.80 You're going to get attacked.
02:50:45.80 --> 02:50:47.80 So we were used to it,
02:50:47.80 --> 02:50:50.80 but it's still, you know, it's pretty intense.
02:50:50.80 --> 02:50:53.80 Yeah, the bears,
02:50:53.80 --> 02:50:58.80 their bears are psycho.
02:50:58.80 --> 02:51:01.80 Is that a accurate statement?
02:51:01.80 --> 02:51:04.80 Yeah, grizzlies have a different,
02:51:04.80 --> 02:51:06.80 although that's a brown bear,
02:51:06.80 --> 02:51:08.80 which is, you know, a grizzly too,
02:51:08.80 --> 02:51:11.80 but so I killed another bear up there.
02:51:11.80 --> 02:51:13.80 There's a limit, there's so many brown bears,
02:51:13.80 --> 02:51:15.80 and non-risen can kill too.
02:51:15.80 --> 02:51:17.80 But we had this bait set up,
02:51:17.80 --> 02:51:19.80 which was legal this year,
02:51:19.80 --> 02:51:21.80 that we were hunting is 2015.
02:51:21.80 --> 02:51:24.80 And the black bear would come in,
02:51:24.80 --> 02:51:26.80 and they would just be pretty docile,
02:51:26.80 --> 02:51:29.80 not wound up at all, pretty relaxed.
02:51:29.80 --> 02:51:32.80 Then a, like, the big bore that I killed,
02:51:32.80 --> 02:51:35.80 the brown bear, not that I wanted to describe there,
02:51:35.80 --> 02:51:36.80 but a different one.
02:51:36.80 --> 02:51:39.80 It would come in, and it'd just be rocking back and forth,
02:51:39.80 --> 02:51:41.80 just like, kind of like possessed.
02:51:41.80 --> 02:51:43.80 And it looked like a dinosaur,
02:51:43.80 --> 02:51:46.80 because it was nine foot six tall, you know,
02:51:46.80 --> 02:51:48.80 it's just a, but on all four,
02:51:48.80 --> 02:51:51.80 so it looked really tall and rocking.
02:51:51.80 --> 02:51:53.80 And just like scanning all around,
02:51:53.80 --> 02:51:55.80 and you're just like, oh my God, this thing isn't saying.
02:51:55.80 --> 02:51:57.80 Yeah, they seem like psychos.
02:51:57.80 --> 02:51:58.80 Yeah, yeah, they,
02:51:58.80 --> 02:52:01.80 and they killed their babies, and they were so, so, so, so.
02:52:01.80 --> 02:52:06.80 And they're freaking huge and so strong.
02:52:06.80 --> 02:52:13.80 All right, I'm gonna fast forward a little bit.
02:52:13.80 --> 02:52:15.80 I was in Colorado bow hunting with Kip,
02:52:15.80 --> 02:52:18.80 and I was in the Fox and Mark Womack.
02:52:18.80 --> 02:52:21.80 I spotted and stalked a big Colorado white tail.
02:52:21.80 --> 02:52:23.80 I hustled toward the buck as quietly as possible.
02:52:23.80 --> 02:52:25.80 He saw something a few times,
02:52:25.80 --> 02:52:27.80 but I was staying pretty low, crawling mostly.
02:52:27.80 --> 02:52:30.80 We figured he thought it was another buck.
02:52:30.80 --> 02:52:32.80 So while I closed in on him,
02:52:32.80 --> 02:52:34.80 he started coming my way.
02:52:34.80 --> 02:52:35.80 He came pretty fast,
02:52:35.80 --> 02:52:36.80 looking his lips,
02:52:36.80 --> 02:52:39.80 and even stopped to make a scrap in the sage brush at 60 yards.
02:52:39.80 --> 02:52:41.80 He started to skirt me a bit,
02:52:41.80 --> 02:52:42.80 so I figured it was time,
02:52:42.80 --> 02:52:43.80 the shop felt good,
02:52:43.80 --> 02:52:45.80 I touched low,
02:52:45.80 --> 02:52:47.80 and he was ordered to a tiny bit.
02:52:47.80 --> 02:52:49.80 I felt it was good enough to kill him,
02:52:49.80 --> 02:52:51.80 so Mark and I backed out,
02:52:51.80 --> 02:52:54.80 planning to come back at first light to recover him.
02:52:54.80 --> 02:52:56.80 That night before bed,
02:52:56.80 --> 02:52:59.80 we reviewed the footage and concluded dead buck.
02:52:59.80 --> 02:53:00.80 Look like the liver,
02:53:00.80 --> 02:53:01.80 but you never know.
02:53:01.80 --> 02:53:03.80 I climbed into my bed that night
02:53:03.80 --> 02:53:06.80 with excitement and belief that we would find the buck in the morning.
02:53:06.80 --> 02:53:08.80 Sleep wouldn't come.
02:53:08.80 --> 02:53:09.80 However,
02:53:09.80 --> 02:53:10.80 at 11 p.m.,
02:53:10.80 --> 02:53:12.80 myself on ring,
02:53:12.80 --> 02:53:14.80 I was always trace.
02:53:14.80 --> 02:53:15.80 Roy's been in an accident,
02:53:15.80 --> 02:53:16.80 she told me.
02:53:16.80 --> 02:53:19.80 She didn't know all the details about what had happened,
02:53:19.80 --> 02:53:22.80 so I knew I needed to call Jill Roy's wife.
02:53:22.80 --> 02:53:25.80 I phoned her and asked what was going on.
02:53:25.80 --> 02:53:27.80 After a long pause, Jill said,
02:53:27.80 --> 02:53:31.80 Cam, Roy's not coming home.
02:53:31.80 --> 02:53:33.80 Jill's voice sounded soft,
02:53:33.80 --> 02:53:34.80 and tired.
02:53:34.80 --> 02:53:36.80 I asked what do you mean?
02:53:36.80 --> 02:53:37.80 She said,
02:53:37.80 --> 02:53:38.80 he fell,
02:53:38.80 --> 02:53:40.80 he passed away.
02:53:40.80 --> 02:53:42.80 My stomach dropped,
02:53:42.80 --> 02:53:45.80 and the darkness of the old farmhouse kitchen I stood in,
02:53:45.80 --> 02:53:46.80 there in the middle of nowhere,
02:53:46.80 --> 02:53:49.80 Colorado felt darker and lonely.
02:53:49.80 --> 02:53:52.80 I couldn't believe her words.
02:53:52.80 --> 02:53:53.80 Right away,
02:53:53.80 --> 02:53:54.80 I found out their children,
02:53:54.80 --> 02:53:57.80 Taylor and Justin and Ellen.
02:53:57.80 --> 02:53:59.80 Roy had fallen 700 feet from a cliff
02:53:59.80 --> 02:54:02.80 in the nasty country we hunted sheep in.
02:54:02.80 --> 02:54:05.80 He was on Pioneer Peak,
02:54:05.80 --> 02:54:07.80 the exact same mountain
02:54:07.80 --> 02:54:10.80 where I had killed my ram in 2008,
02:54:10.80 --> 02:54:13.80 and where Roy had killed ram since.
02:54:13.80 --> 02:54:16.80 Now, in 2015,
02:54:16.80 --> 02:54:19.80 the mountain had won.
02:54:26.80 --> 02:54:28.80 In this chapter,
02:54:28.80 --> 02:54:29.80 the book is called,
02:54:29.80 --> 02:54:32.80 Legends Never Die.
02:54:32.80 --> 02:54:34.80 Hmm.
02:54:34.80 --> 02:54:38.80 Yeah, I have a hard time even thinking about this
02:54:38.80 --> 02:54:42.80 still without getting choked up.
02:54:42.80 --> 02:54:48.80 There's people that come in your life
02:54:48.80 --> 02:54:49.80 that,
02:54:49.80 --> 02:54:51.80 I don't know,
02:54:51.80 --> 02:54:53.80 he's just one of those guys who I always believed in me.
02:54:53.80 --> 02:54:54.80 And we had,
02:54:54.80 --> 02:54:56.80 you know,
02:54:56.80 --> 02:54:57.80 it's like a bond,
02:54:57.80 --> 02:54:59.80 you go through hard things with people,
02:54:59.80 --> 02:55:00.80 and I know it's,
02:55:00.80 --> 02:55:02.80 and I can imagine it's like this with the military
02:55:02.80 --> 02:55:04.80 where you have,
02:55:04.80 --> 02:55:05.80 you just like a brotherhood,
02:55:05.80 --> 02:55:06.80 you know,
02:55:06.80 --> 02:55:08.80 because of what you've went through.
02:55:08.80 --> 02:55:10.80 And that's how it was with,
02:55:10.80 --> 02:55:12.80 with Roy and I in that,
02:55:12.80 --> 02:55:14.80 in that regard.
02:55:14.80 --> 02:55:16.80 So yeah.
02:55:16.80 --> 02:55:17.80 I don't know.
02:55:17.80 --> 02:55:18.80 We have a lot of,
02:55:18.80 --> 02:55:19.80 a lot of big plans,
02:55:19.80 --> 02:55:21.80 a lot of things were going good for us,
02:55:21.80 --> 02:55:23.80 that we talked about and dreamed about
02:55:23.80 --> 02:55:24.80 for our whole lives,
02:55:24.80 --> 02:55:25.80 you know,
02:55:25.80 --> 02:55:27.80 he's becoming an outfitter up there.
02:55:27.80 --> 02:55:28.80 He's,
02:55:28.80 --> 02:55:30.80 like a legend up there,
02:55:30.80 --> 02:55:32.80 and people would talk about Roy,
02:55:32.80 --> 02:55:33.80 and a,
02:55:33.80 --> 02:55:34.80 and a lask.
02:55:34.80 --> 02:55:35.80 It's hard to be legend,
02:55:35.80 --> 02:55:36.80 a legend in a lask.
02:55:36.80 --> 02:55:38.80 There's a lot of legendary people,
02:55:38.80 --> 02:55:40.80 but he was earning that name,
02:55:40.80 --> 02:55:42.80 and so yeah,
02:55:42.80 --> 02:55:44.80 felt,
02:55:44.80 --> 02:55:45.80 I don't know,
02:55:45.80 --> 02:55:46.80 still feels,
02:55:46.80 --> 02:55:47.80 I mean,
02:55:47.80 --> 02:55:49.80 I'm still upset about it,
02:55:49.80 --> 02:55:51.80 still mad,
02:55:51.80 --> 02:55:52.80 because,
02:55:52.80 --> 02:55:53.80 you know,
02:55:53.80 --> 02:55:56.80 we had so much left to do.
02:55:56.80 --> 02:55:57.80 Yeah.
02:55:57.80 --> 02:55:59.80 I know a lot of times you'll,
02:55:59.80 --> 02:56:00.80 you know,
02:56:00.80 --> 02:56:01.80 you're talking about the military,
02:56:01.80 --> 02:56:02.80 aspect of things,
02:56:02.80 --> 02:56:03.80 and I mean,
02:56:03.80 --> 02:56:05.80 I still post pictures of my friend,
02:56:05.80 --> 02:56:06.80 that I've lost,
02:56:06.80 --> 02:56:09.80 and I can tell by what you write that,
02:56:09.80 --> 02:56:11.80 he still is pushing you,
02:56:11.80 --> 02:56:13.80 even though he's not here,
02:56:13.80 --> 02:56:14.80 and you know,
02:56:14.80 --> 02:56:15.80 you can go a little bit further,
02:56:15.80 --> 02:56:18.80 and you can be a little bit more Roy tough,
02:56:18.80 --> 02:56:19.80 as,
02:56:19.80 --> 02:56:20.80 as you put some of those things,
02:56:20.80 --> 02:56:22.80 and that's the same thing I think about,
02:56:22.80 --> 02:56:23.80 you know,
02:56:23.80 --> 02:56:24.80 the same thing,
02:56:24.80 --> 02:56:25.80 the same thing,
02:56:25.80 --> 02:56:26.80 hey,
02:56:26.80 --> 02:56:27.80 you know,
02:56:27.80 --> 02:56:29.80 the same thing,
02:56:29.80 --> 02:56:29.80 hey,
02:56:29.80 --> 02:56:30.80 I mean,
02:56:30.80 --> 02:56:32.80 I got guys that died,
02:56:32.80 --> 02:56:34.80 when they were way too young,
02:56:34.80 --> 02:56:35.80 way too young,
02:56:35.80 --> 02:56:36.80 yeah,
02:56:36.80 --> 02:56:38.80 and they don't have the opportunity
02:56:38.80 --> 02:56:41.80 to carry on,
02:56:41.80 --> 02:56:42.80 and the opportunity that,
02:56:42.80 --> 02:56:44.80 to do the things that I get to do right now,
02:56:44.80 --> 02:56:47.80 and even if that thing is just getting up in the morning,
02:56:47.80 --> 02:56:48.80 and going for a workout,
02:56:48.80 --> 02:56:49.80 like,
02:56:49.80 --> 02:56:51.80 that's a gift,
02:56:51.80 --> 02:56:52.80 you know,
02:56:52.80 --> 02:56:54.80 hmm.
02:56:54.80 --> 02:56:54.80 Well,
02:56:54.80 --> 02:56:55.80 I wouldn't,
02:56:55.80 --> 02:56:56.80 Roy started moving,
02:56:56.80 --> 02:56:57.80 I mean,
02:56:57.80 --> 02:56:58.80 I wouldn't be here.
02:56:58.80 --> 02:56:59.80 It's like,
02:56:59.80 --> 02:57:00.80 normally,
02:57:00.80 --> 02:57:01.80 after I would do something like this,
02:57:01.80 --> 02:57:04.80 I would call Roy,
02:57:04.80 --> 02:57:05.80 and we,
02:57:05.80 --> 02:57:05.80 you know,
02:57:05.80 --> 02:57:06.80 this is,
02:57:06.80 --> 02:57:08.80 this is all part of our thing,
02:57:08.80 --> 02:57:10.80 or we did it.
02:57:10.80 --> 02:57:11.80 And,
02:57:11.80 --> 02:57:12.80 you know,
02:57:12.80 --> 02:57:13.80 that's,
02:57:13.80 --> 02:57:14.80 that's a reason why,
02:57:14.80 --> 02:57:15.80 I mean,
02:57:15.80 --> 02:57:17.80 I picked that picture on the cover of the book,
02:57:17.80 --> 02:57:18.80 that's from our last hunt,
02:57:18.80 --> 02:57:20.80 and it was a moose hunt,
02:57:20.80 --> 02:57:22.80 two weeks before we died,
02:57:22.80 --> 02:57:23.80 and,
02:57:23.80 --> 02:57:25.80 you know,
02:57:25.80 --> 02:57:26.80 you know,
02:57:26.80 --> 02:57:27.80 I mean,
02:57:27.80 --> 02:57:28.80 it's just,
02:57:28.80 --> 02:57:29.80 you got to get by,
02:57:29.80 --> 02:57:30.80 you got to,
02:57:30.80 --> 02:57:30.80 you know,
02:57:30.80 --> 02:57:31.80 if you want to,
02:57:31.80 --> 02:57:33.80 they say it might be cliche,
02:57:33.80 --> 02:57:34.80 but you know,
02:57:34.80 --> 02:57:36.80 people die twice when they,
02:57:36.80 --> 02:57:37.80 when they're life ends,
02:57:37.80 --> 02:57:40.80 and then the last time somebody mentions their name.
02:57:40.80 --> 02:57:42.80 And so,
02:57:42.80 --> 02:57:44.80 just like you bring up the guys that,
02:57:44.80 --> 02:57:45.80 you know,
02:57:45.80 --> 02:57:46.80 that you've lost.
02:57:46.80 --> 02:57:48.80 I'm always going to honor Roy.
02:57:48.80 --> 02:57:50.80 I'm doing it right now.
02:57:50.80 --> 02:57:51.80 This is what I'm doing.
02:57:51.80 --> 02:57:53.80 I'm doing it in the book,
02:57:53.80 --> 02:57:55.80 because without him,
02:57:55.80 --> 02:57:56.80 I wouldn't be here,
02:57:56.80 --> 02:57:57.80 and,
02:57:57.80 --> 02:57:59.80 so,
02:57:59.80 --> 02:58:01.80 I mean,
02:58:01.80 --> 02:58:02.80 yeah,
02:58:02.80 --> 02:58:03.80 it's just,
02:58:03.80 --> 02:58:04.80 it's tough.
02:58:04.80 --> 02:58:05.80 I mean,
02:58:05.80 --> 02:58:06.80 I still,
02:58:06.80 --> 02:58:08.80 I'm still in contact with Jill all the time,
02:58:08.80 --> 02:58:10.80 and,
02:58:10.80 --> 02:58:11.80 yeah,
02:58:11.80 --> 02:58:12.80 just,
02:58:12.80 --> 02:58:13.80 I don't know,
02:58:13.80 --> 02:58:14.80 life changing.
02:58:14.80 --> 02:58:15.80 Yeah.
02:58:15.80 --> 02:58:18.80 And again,
02:58:18.80 --> 02:58:22.80 you put so many cool stories and details about all that,
02:58:22.80 --> 02:58:23.80 that,
02:58:23.80 --> 02:58:24.80 this is another reason,
02:58:24.80 --> 02:58:25.80 just to,
02:58:25.80 --> 02:58:27.80 to get the book and learn some of those things,
02:58:27.80 --> 02:58:30.80 and keep saying that name.
02:58:30.80 --> 02:58:32.80 I want to close out,
02:58:32.80 --> 02:58:33.80 you know,
02:58:33.80 --> 02:58:34.80 obviously,
02:58:34.80 --> 02:58:35.80 I'm not reading the whole book,
02:58:35.80 --> 02:58:37.80 but I just want to close out with one,
02:58:37.80 --> 02:58:39.80 one section here.
02:58:39.80 --> 02:58:41.80 Towards the end of the book,
02:58:41.80 --> 02:58:42.80 you say,
02:58:42.80 --> 02:58:43.80 many years ago,
02:58:43.80 --> 02:58:47.80 I decided I was going to work hard every day on being the very best bow hunter I could be.
02:58:47.80 --> 02:58:49.80 Along with taking care of my family,
02:58:49.80 --> 02:58:50.80 that is my purpose in life.
02:58:50.80 --> 02:58:51.80 Everything I do is prioritized,
02:58:51.80 --> 02:58:53.80 I've been as prioritized around this drive and this dream.
02:58:53.80 --> 02:58:57.80 I started 5am and finish at APM every day.
02:58:57.80 --> 02:58:58.80 I give it my best.
02:58:58.80 --> 02:59:01.80 I have gratitude for the gifts and opportunities I'm given.
02:59:01.80 --> 02:59:03.80 I enjoy the journey.
02:59:03.80 --> 02:59:05.80 Steve Prefontane was right.
02:59:05.80 --> 02:59:09.80 To give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift.
02:59:09.80 --> 02:59:11.80 That's exactly how I look at it.
02:59:11.80 --> 02:59:13.80 Bow hunting can be a struggle.
02:59:13.80 --> 02:59:15.80 It's hard and very competitive.
02:59:15.80 --> 02:59:17.80 It can be very cut throat.
02:59:17.80 --> 02:59:19.80 But so can life.
02:59:19.80 --> 02:59:22.80 Life can be tough and beat us down.
02:59:22.80 --> 02:59:23.80 We experience loss.
02:59:23.80 --> 02:59:27.80 I loved one or a family member or a job or a dream.
02:59:27.80 --> 02:59:30.80 We battle our own demons and dependencies.
02:59:30.80 --> 02:59:34.80 We all take hits and get beaten down.
02:59:34.80 --> 02:59:37.80 That's when we have choices to make.
02:59:37.80 --> 02:59:40.80 Only you can choose not to hesitate.
02:59:40.80 --> 02:59:42.80 Only you can keep moving.
02:59:42.80 --> 02:59:45.80 Only you can climb over snow and ice.
02:59:45.80 --> 02:59:48.80 And tough footing and steep rugged country.
02:59:48.80 --> 02:59:52.80 What dream do you hold that you're not going to let go of?
02:59:52.80 --> 02:59:55.80 If I can do it, anyone can.
02:59:55.80 --> 02:59:57.80 But you will have to earn it.
02:59:57.80 --> 02:59:59.80 You will have to endure.
02:59:59.80 --> 03:00:02.80 You will have to keep hammering.
03:00:02.80 --> 03:00:17.80 So again, if you're listening to this, get the book.
03:00:17.80 --> 03:00:21.80 Let's make this thing a freaking best seller.
03:00:21.80 --> 03:00:29.80 Just to spite the people that don't want this book to be a best seller.
03:00:29.80 --> 03:00:30.80 So many things.
03:00:30.80 --> 03:00:33.80 And there's like I said, there's a bunch of things that I didn't cover here.
03:00:33.80 --> 03:00:37.80 And as you've said about the book, it's, and it clearly isn't.
03:00:37.80 --> 03:00:39.80 It's not just about bow hunting.
03:00:39.80 --> 03:00:41.80 It's not just about bow hunting.
03:00:41.80 --> 03:00:42.80 It's about life.
03:00:42.80 --> 03:00:45.80 And it's going to do a ton of things to help people.
03:00:45.80 --> 03:00:49.80 Get through whatever they're getting through and be on the right path in their lives.
03:00:49.80 --> 03:00:53.80 Some of the things we didn't cover in this book, I just wanted to keep hammering.
03:00:53.80 --> 03:01:01.80 So you, according to the book, you do talk about this, but Bob From, who's a San Diego kind of legend,
03:01:01.80 --> 03:01:03.80 archery guy Hunter.
03:01:03.80 --> 03:01:05.80 He runs performance archery here in San Diego.
03:01:05.80 --> 03:01:07.80 And he used to call you cam the hammer.
03:01:07.80 --> 03:01:09.80 Is that what that originated from?
03:01:09.80 --> 03:01:10.80 Yeah.
03:01:10.80 --> 03:01:11.80 You know Bob?
03:01:11.80 --> 03:01:12.80 Yeah.
03:01:12.80 --> 03:01:17.80 How he's charismatic and always just talk in is kind of cool.
03:01:17.80 --> 03:01:22.80 So he would say, you know, call me and say, hey, what's up cam the hammer?
03:01:22.80 --> 03:01:25.80 So just him.
03:01:25.80 --> 03:01:27.80 He was kind of a legend to me too.
03:01:27.80 --> 03:01:30.80 He was on a magazine called Western Bow Hunter.
03:01:30.80 --> 03:01:32.80 And he's seemed like he was on the cover all the time.
03:01:32.80 --> 03:01:35.80 And so he made Bow hunting cool.
03:01:35.80 --> 03:01:39.80 So for, yeah, I was going to have a longer hair kind of good looking guys.
03:01:39.80 --> 03:01:43.80 Pretty badass.
03:01:43.80 --> 03:01:48.80 And then you got a section in there, Rogan talking about Rogan.
03:01:48.80 --> 03:01:51.80 How do you meet Rogan originally?
03:01:51.80 --> 03:01:53.80 I don't know. He sent out a tweet.
03:01:53.80 --> 03:01:58.80 So I went to his podcast in 2014 and then I took him a bow.
03:01:58.80 --> 03:02:02.80 And if you know, he almost like once he gets into something, it's all the way.
03:02:02.80 --> 03:02:03.80 Right.
03:02:03.80 --> 03:02:04.80 So then I said, well, let's go.
03:02:04.80 --> 03:02:05.80 Let's do a hunt.
03:02:05.80 --> 03:02:08.80 And a good first hunt is a bear hunt because it's usually closed.
03:02:08.80 --> 03:02:11.80 And I could, you know, be there with them.
03:02:11.80 --> 03:02:13.80 And I don't know if I agree with that for.
03:02:13.80 --> 03:02:18.80 Well, it's just that the shot distance isn't less can go wrong.
03:02:18.80 --> 03:02:18.80 Yeah.
03:02:18.80 --> 03:02:19.80 It's adrenaline.
03:02:19.80 --> 03:02:20.80 Yeah.
03:02:20.80 --> 03:02:21.80 I don't know.
03:02:21.80 --> 03:02:23.80 There's a really one major thing that can go wrong.
03:02:23.80 --> 03:02:24.80 Yeah.
03:02:24.80 --> 03:02:25.80 Well, that's yeah.
03:02:25.80 --> 03:02:27.80 That's what the tracking and the wounding and all that.
03:02:27.80 --> 03:02:32.80 But if you do things right, it can be pretty high percentage of chances success.
03:02:32.80 --> 03:02:35.80 So I thought, let's go on a bear hunt.
03:02:35.80 --> 03:02:38.80 And as funny, he killed a bear.
03:02:38.80 --> 03:02:39.80 We got a picture of it.
03:02:39.80 --> 03:02:45.80 And I remember we were up there and I'm like, I go, hey, I put up a post of the picture of you
03:02:45.80 --> 03:02:47.80 and you're, and you're bear.
03:02:47.80 --> 03:02:48.80 And he's like, yeah, no.
03:02:48.80 --> 03:02:52.80 I've heard all about it already because it's like bear.
03:02:52.80 --> 03:02:56.80 And then if you're like a celebrity type and then killing a bear,
03:02:56.80 --> 03:02:58.80 it's like, I thought people think they're endangered.
03:02:58.80 --> 03:03:01.80 You know, because no people think they're windy the pool.
03:03:01.80 --> 03:03:02.80 Yeah.
03:03:02.80 --> 03:03:03.80 Yeah.
03:03:03.80 --> 03:03:05.80 I'm a little bit more endangered or both.
03:03:05.80 --> 03:03:11.80 And so yeah, he was kind of, you know, that's where he really was driven home about hunting
03:03:11.80 --> 03:03:12.80 and animals.
03:03:12.80 --> 03:03:15.80 And there's a negative connotation with it.
03:03:15.80 --> 03:03:18.80 Obviously, people who don't do it or don't understand it.
03:03:18.80 --> 03:03:20.80 Anyway, so that was in 2014.
03:03:20.80 --> 03:03:21.80 Yeah.
03:03:21.80 --> 03:03:24.80 And you, that's another part of the book that we didn't really talk about.
03:03:24.80 --> 03:03:26.80 You explained all that stuff.
03:03:26.80 --> 03:03:32.80 You explained how hunting works and how conservation works and how animal management works.
03:03:32.80 --> 03:03:38.80 And if you just let these animals go, like, there's some species that will get completely wiped out.
03:03:38.80 --> 03:03:40.80 And that'll, off balance everything.
03:03:40.80 --> 03:03:43.80 So all the stuff is so tightly controlled.
03:03:43.80 --> 03:03:44.80 Yeah.
03:03:44.80 --> 03:03:48.80 That it's actually what keeps the environment in balance.
03:03:48.80 --> 03:03:50.80 Well, I saw this very popular.
03:03:50.80 --> 03:03:52.80 He's like kind of an animal rights activist.
03:03:52.80 --> 03:03:54.80 He's got millions of followers.
03:03:54.80 --> 03:04:00.80 He posted this video of this leopard attacking a man in kind of like a city.
03:04:00.80 --> 03:04:01.80 Right?
03:04:01.80 --> 03:04:09.80 He said, you go, see, this is what happens when humans and crotch on animals animal habitat.
03:04:09.80 --> 03:04:10.80 And that's what he said.
03:04:10.80 --> 03:04:12.80 And I'm like, well, no shit.
03:04:12.80 --> 03:04:15.80 That's what we do everywhere.
03:04:15.80 --> 03:04:19.80 That's why animal numbers need to be managed because that's what cities are.
03:04:19.80 --> 03:04:21.80 There used to be animals here.
03:04:21.80 --> 03:04:22.80 Now there's a city.
03:04:22.80 --> 03:04:24.80 So as a city grows, we're approaching.
03:04:24.80 --> 03:04:28.80 So you can't have the same amount of animals that we're here 20 years ago.
03:04:28.80 --> 03:04:29.80 If there's less habitat.
03:04:29.80 --> 03:04:34.80 So that's where that whole balance and the biology and the carrying capacity of land come in.
03:04:34.80 --> 03:04:37.80 But yeah, it's in hunting funds all that.
03:04:37.80 --> 03:04:41.80 That's the key point with there's kind of a catch phrase hunting is conservation.
03:04:41.80 --> 03:04:47.80 Which is because hunting pays for that habitat enhancement in the studies and the welfare of animals.
03:04:47.80 --> 03:04:48.80 Yeah.
03:04:48.80 --> 03:04:52.80 And Jill wrote the forward to this book, which is awesome.
03:04:52.80 --> 03:04:54.80 Did a great job of that.
03:04:54.80 --> 03:05:01.80 You know, like, I guess people sometimes, I guess they make a jealous of Jill Rogan.
03:05:01.80 --> 03:05:07.80 Because he's got so much popularity.
03:05:07.80 --> 03:05:09.80 But man, he's good at shit.
03:05:09.80 --> 03:05:13.80 Like you were just saying, he's freaking good at archery.
03:05:13.80 --> 03:05:14.80 Yeah.
03:05:14.80 --> 03:05:14.80 Yeah.
03:05:14.80 --> 03:05:15.80 Yeah.
03:05:15.80 --> 03:05:16.80 People are like, are you not ready?
03:05:16.80 --> 03:05:17.80 Why do you really know about fighting?
03:05:17.80 --> 03:05:18.80 Dude, that guy fought.
03:05:18.80 --> 03:05:20.80 That guy's a black belt in due jitsu.
03:05:20.80 --> 03:05:24.80 And then they think that doing a podcast is easy.
03:05:24.80 --> 03:05:25.80 Oh, man.
03:05:25.80 --> 03:05:28.80 And doing the way he does a podcast is easy.
03:05:28.80 --> 03:05:32.80 Talking to people off the top of his head for two, three, four, five hours.
03:05:32.80 --> 03:05:34.80 Like crazy.
03:05:34.80 --> 03:05:37.80 Oh, I listen to a lot of shitty podcasts.
03:05:37.80 --> 03:05:40.80 That those people think podcast is easy.
03:05:40.80 --> 03:05:42.80 But Joe does make it seem.
03:05:42.80 --> 03:05:43.80 He does.
03:05:43.80 --> 03:05:47.80 That's so, it's so hard to make a conversation interesting.
03:05:47.80 --> 03:05:51.80 And, you know, the first time I went on there, I'm like, so do you have a,
03:05:51.80 --> 03:05:54.80 we got questions or he's like, no.
03:05:54.80 --> 03:05:55.80 No.
03:05:55.80 --> 03:05:58.80 So he's like, I was like, oh, we're just going to, just going to bullshit.
03:05:58.80 --> 03:06:02.80 Most of time, if guys just sit down just to bullshit, it's going to be awful.
03:06:02.80 --> 03:06:03.80 Yeah.
03:06:03.80 --> 03:06:03.80 Yeah.
03:06:03.80 --> 03:06:04.80 Yeah.
03:06:04.80 --> 03:06:07.80 And people think that other people want to hear you bullshit.
03:06:07.80 --> 03:06:08.80 Yeah.
03:06:08.80 --> 03:06:09.80 Well, if I want to do that, just go to a restaurant.
03:06:09.80 --> 03:06:11.80 Sit in the booth next to you and listen.
03:06:11.80 --> 03:06:13.80 You're talking about freaking going to get grocery shopping dinner.
03:06:13.80 --> 03:06:14.80 Right.
03:06:14.80 --> 03:06:15.80 Because I think that's the best.
03:06:15.80 --> 03:06:20.80 Or usually it's about some kids tea ball coach who Tim, he should be playing more.
03:06:20.80 --> 03:06:22.80 Starting, but it's just whatever.
03:06:22.80 --> 03:06:31.80 How long was it between when you got him a bow and he went hunting for a bear?
03:06:31.80 --> 03:06:32.80 I think.
03:06:32.80 --> 03:06:34.80 I mean, a few months probably.
03:06:34.80 --> 03:06:35.80 Right.
03:06:35.80 --> 03:06:36.80 Yeah.
03:06:36.80 --> 03:06:38.80 I can't remember when I went down there, but we went spring bear hunting.
03:06:38.80 --> 03:06:42.80 So it was about this time of year in 2014, I believe.
03:06:42.80 --> 03:06:43.80 Yeah.
03:06:43.80 --> 03:06:47.80 I can't remember, but a few months, you know, he was confident in shooting.
03:06:47.80 --> 03:06:53.80 You know, because he probably did it 20 hours a day because he's pretty obsessive.
03:06:53.80 --> 03:06:57.80 And now we're actually kind of unified now in a way.
03:06:57.80 --> 03:07:07.80 Because we got you, Joe, Kip, me, Pete Roberts with this new venture, or Jean Hunt,
03:07:07.80 --> 03:07:14.80 making American-made hunting gear clothing.
03:07:14.80 --> 03:07:24.80 That's a kind of big step for you going into founding a company and moving in that direction.
03:07:24.80 --> 03:07:26.80 How's that feel?
03:07:26.80 --> 03:07:27.80 Feels incredible.
03:07:27.80 --> 03:07:34.80 I still feel like the small town guy making $4.72 an hour working part-time at a warehouse.
03:07:34.80 --> 03:07:38.80 And now you say founding a company, it's just again.
03:07:38.80 --> 03:07:40.80 This is all this journey.
03:07:40.80 --> 03:07:45.80 And the whole point to all this, I think, in the book and everything else in my story,
03:07:45.80 --> 03:07:52.80 is that just staying on the path, staying on the path, and over time,
03:07:52.80 --> 03:07:54.80 who knows what's going to happen.
03:07:54.80 --> 03:07:59.80 You couldn't have told me back when I was at Kid Getting Drunken Punch at Parties,
03:07:59.80 --> 03:08:03.80 because I got a smart ass that, do you know someday you're going to be doing this?
03:08:03.80 --> 03:08:07.80 I'd be like, you got to be talking about somebody else.
03:08:07.80 --> 03:08:10.80 Because there's no way, so it seems surreal.
03:08:10.80 --> 03:08:15.80 But you know, you make these relationships in these decisions, and you keep working and working
03:08:15.80 --> 03:08:22.80 and working, and after 30-some years, like this journey has been, who knows what's going to happen.
03:08:22.80 --> 03:08:25.80 And I was thinking about this yesterday as I ran on the beach.
03:08:25.80 --> 03:08:28.80 I saw this kid down there fishing.
03:08:28.80 --> 03:08:32.80 And I'm like, what if this kid, like, I couldn't imagine if I lived in the city,
03:08:32.80 --> 03:08:35.80 I couldn't imagine if I lived here, what would I do?
03:08:35.80 --> 03:08:38.80 What would I have stood out in anything? I don't know.
03:08:38.80 --> 03:08:42.80 But I was one of one of that kid. He's down here fishing by himself.
03:08:42.80 --> 03:08:47.80 And, you know, made the decision to come down on the Saturday morning and hey, let's see what I can do.
03:08:47.80 --> 03:08:53.80 What if that's going to lead him, maybe he's going to be the most well-known fisherman in the world at some point?
03:08:53.80 --> 03:08:58.80 But you can't tell from a glimpse and, you know, when you're young,
03:08:58.80 --> 03:09:00.80 you don't know what your life's going to hold.
03:09:00.80 --> 03:09:04.80 You don't know, you know, then you have kids and you want them to be special in their own right.
03:09:04.80 --> 03:09:07.80 And this all is journey. That's all the book is about.
03:09:07.80 --> 03:09:14.80 It's just like, you know, stay true to yourself, keep working hard, endure, and who knows?
03:09:14.80 --> 03:09:17.80 Next in, you'll have your own line of hunting gear.
03:09:17.80 --> 03:09:22.80 How exciting is that? I mean, you see that how fired up people are?
03:09:22.80 --> 03:09:24.80 Oh, yeah. I mean, it's a maze.
03:09:24.80 --> 03:09:35.80 I'm more excited about it. Because I've been saying, and as I've said every time I talk about this, there's no more patriotic group of people than hunters.
03:09:35.80 --> 03:09:39.80 And hunters don't want to buy stuff that's not made in America.
03:09:39.80 --> 03:09:44.80 Yeah. And they don't really have many options right now. And they're about to have options.
03:09:44.80 --> 03:09:51.80 I mean, I think if anybody could be half as excited as Kip is, that'd be pretty damn good start.
03:09:51.80 --> 03:09:59.80 He's like going through, he's always, you know, loves the videos of trying this stuff on and bending over and talking about the cuts.
03:09:59.80 --> 03:10:02.80 And it's just like, in this guy has, I don't know how much money.
03:10:02.80 --> 03:10:06.80 A lot of money from when under Armour and what public.
03:10:06.80 --> 03:10:11.80 And he doesn't have to do this. So it's like, you know it's just passion.
03:10:11.80 --> 03:10:13.80 And it's what he loves.
03:10:13.80 --> 03:10:17.80 Yeah. And so how could you not be excited for that?
03:10:17.80 --> 03:10:22.80 Yeah. And he doesn't have to do this. And originally he reached out to Pete.
03:10:22.80 --> 03:10:27.80 Just because he saw what we were doing with origin. He saw that we were just making freaking
03:10:27.80 --> 03:10:31.80 Gees, Getsu Gees in America and thought that was cool.
03:10:31.80 --> 03:10:38.80 Yeah. And probably probably also thought, man, I better help these jackass out.
03:10:38.80 --> 03:10:43.80 Because he's, I mean, he has grown up doing that.
03:10:43.80 --> 03:10:51.80 Yeah. Literally from college on. And I mean, when he rattles off kind of the stats of like, you know, I open 38 factory.
03:10:51.80 --> 03:10:54.80 You know, like, he's, I forget what the numbers are, but yeah, it's incredible.
03:10:54.80 --> 03:10:56.80 I mean, think about how big of a company under Armour and it's right.
03:10:56.80 --> 03:11:03.80 And he was, he was running that on the backside for all those years and built it.
03:11:03.80 --> 03:11:07.80 So he's definitely been a huge help to Pete.
03:11:07.80 --> 03:11:14.80 Pete Roberts is the other owner who he's like the manufacturer from our team, you know,
03:11:14.80 --> 03:11:18.80 and he's done an incredible job of build something for the ground up as well.
03:11:18.80 --> 03:11:23.80 And so this, we, so we kind of had the ingredients.
03:11:23.80 --> 03:11:27.80 Well, I mean, we phrase that we had some of the ingredients, right?
03:11:27.80 --> 03:11:33.80 We had, we had Pete who knew how to make stuff in America, right? That's part of the ingredients.
03:11:33.80 --> 03:11:42.80 We knew I, I could get the word out about it. Kip has the, the actual experience to get it done and the design experience,
03:11:42.80 --> 03:11:49.80 but, you know, we needed somebody that was legit that actually could say this is what we need.
03:11:49.80 --> 03:11:56.80 This is how it needs to work and who else, you know, why not just why not just throw a freaking,
03:11:56.80 --> 03:12:03.80 you know, a 200 yard archery shot out. See if we can bullseye, we've pulled it off.
03:12:03.80 --> 03:12:10.80 Well, it's, I mean, it's an honor to be involved for sure because it's, it gives me so much pride just to know and we're doing something that
03:12:10.80 --> 03:12:14.80 could make a difference. You know, it's like that's our whole point to life.
03:12:14.80 --> 03:12:17.80 Is I, what are you doing? This going to make a positive difference.
03:12:17.80 --> 03:12:21.80 And I feel like this is, you know, it's causing a ripple effect.
03:12:21.80 --> 03:12:27.80 And, you know, bringing those videos. It's like, it's like, I saw one the other day,
03:12:27.80 --> 03:12:31.80 Orgen put up and I think it was, is it dacks? Yep.
03:12:31.80 --> 03:12:36.80 And talking about, you know, he feels like he's just a small part of the machine,
03:12:36.80 --> 03:12:41.80 but, but talking about bringing American manufacturing back to America,
03:12:41.80 --> 03:12:46.80 it's, it reminds me, I watched this old series called The Min Who Built America.
03:12:46.80 --> 03:12:49.80 Have you watched it? I have watched a few of those.
03:12:49.80 --> 03:12:54.80 So it reminds me of that. It's like that, that type of effort and that vision
03:12:54.80 --> 03:12:59.80 starts there. Yeah. And it's, when I see those factories in the working and the,
03:12:59.80 --> 03:13:04.80 and the workers and the people and the pride in it and the, and I, like,
03:13:04.80 --> 03:13:12.80 people like Dax, it's like, I don't know, it gives you butterflies almost.
03:13:12.80 --> 03:13:16.80 It's special. Yeah, it really is.
03:13:16.80 --> 03:13:21.80 And it's, um, to Pete's credit.
03:13:21.80 --> 03:13:25.80 Pupika told this was impossible five years ago.
03:13:25.80 --> 03:13:28.80 There's no way we can manufacture geese in America.
03:13:28.80 --> 03:13:33.80 He got told that. Like everyone kind of looked at him like he was kind of crazy.
03:13:33.80 --> 03:13:35.80 And maybe they were right. Yeah.
03:13:35.80 --> 03:13:37.80 Maybe Pete is a little bit crazy. Yeah.
03:13:37.80 --> 03:13:44.80 But, you know, just like you did with our tree, he just kept at it and kept trying to figure out,
03:13:44.80 --> 03:13:48.80 how do you overcome this obstacle? What do you do in this situation?
03:13:48.80 --> 03:13:54.80 How do we get by that? And he built a great foundation and has great knowledge.
03:13:54.80 --> 03:14:00.80 And then you throw someone like, kip into the mix, who's done all that and taking it to the next level.
03:14:00.80 --> 03:14:05.80 Uh, because, you know, Pete's a humble guy. He's not sitting around thinking he has all the answers.
03:14:05.80 --> 03:14:09.80 And so when you throw someone like kip into the mix, who does have,
03:14:09.80 --> 03:14:11.80 he may not have all the answers.
03:14:11.80 --> 03:14:16.80 He's got a lot of them done. You know, from the business side, from the manufacturing side,
03:14:16.80 --> 03:14:20.80 from the design side, he's got like a incredible amount of experience.
03:14:20.80 --> 03:14:25.80 So that's awesome. And then having you to give your guidance,
03:14:25.80 --> 03:14:27.80 which is really what everything's based on.
03:14:27.80 --> 03:14:33.80 It's like, what does this guy want to pre-mear bow hunters in the world?
03:14:33.80 --> 03:14:36.80 What does this guy think this should be like?
03:14:36.80 --> 03:14:40.80 Then let, then we have something special.
03:14:40.80 --> 03:14:44.80 Yeah, it's, well, don't you think that that, like you mentioned Pete and being humble?
03:14:44.80 --> 03:14:48.80 Don't you think that that's a key ingredient to like businesses like this is ego?
03:14:48.80 --> 03:14:52.80 I see ego killing so many great opportunities.
03:14:52.80 --> 03:14:58.80 So the fact that he's humble and like, and says he doesn't, he probably has a lot of the answers.
03:14:58.80 --> 03:15:03.80 But just being open to hearing somebody else, it's so paramount to a successful business.
03:15:03.80 --> 03:15:06.80 I, ego kills so much that could have been special.
03:15:06.80 --> 03:15:07.80 Yeah.
03:15:07.80 --> 03:15:11.80 I mean, obviously I have a leadership consulting company.
03:15:11.80 --> 03:15:15.80 And when people always ask, well, what's that main problem that you see?
03:15:15.80 --> 03:15:17.80 And it is, the main problem that we see is ego.
03:15:17.80 --> 03:15:21.80 You know, I don't want to listen to your plan because I think my plan is better than yours.
03:15:21.80 --> 03:15:24.80 And I don't even want to hear your plan because I think my plan is better than yours.
03:15:24.80 --> 03:15:26.80 That's just all ego.
03:15:26.80 --> 03:15:30.80 And to just be able to say, hey, you know what, can I think, let's try your idea.
03:15:30.80 --> 03:15:32.80 That sounds like it's actually sounds like it's better than mine.
03:15:32.80 --> 03:15:33.80 Let's go with that.
03:15:33.80 --> 03:15:36.80 To have that open mindness is what brings on
03:15:36.80 --> 03:15:37.80 success.
03:15:37.80 --> 03:15:40.80 I mean, it's just like anything else.
03:15:40.80 --> 03:15:44.80 But you know, if you're doing jigset, so when you're like, hey, I already know how to do an arm lock.
03:15:44.80 --> 03:15:50.80 I guarantee you get all in the mat with Dean Lister or Jeff Glover.
03:15:50.80 --> 03:15:54.80 They're going to be like, they're going to be able to teach you something about that arm lock that you did not know.
03:15:54.80 --> 03:15:56.80 This is a move I've done a thousand times.
03:15:56.80 --> 03:15:58.80 I've done it 10,000 times.
03:15:58.80 --> 03:15:59.80 Maybe even a hundred thousand times.
03:15:59.80 --> 03:16:04.80 But if Dean or Jeff or someone that's an expert goes, hey, you should have moved your
03:16:04.80 --> 03:16:06.80 absolute little bit more over here.
03:16:06.80 --> 03:16:07.80 You should have hold the risk like this.
03:16:07.80 --> 03:16:11.80 You're going to learn every time with with with bow hunting.
03:16:11.80 --> 03:16:15.80 You go, oh, well, how do you think we should do this?
03:16:15.80 --> 03:16:16.80 What can I?
03:16:16.80 --> 03:16:17.80 Well, even more important.
03:16:17.80 --> 03:16:20.80 You know, when's the last time you said, you know what?
03:16:20.80 --> 03:16:21.80 I'll be good.
03:16:21.80 --> 03:16:23.80 My shots will hit.
03:16:23.80 --> 03:16:24.80 I shoot enough.
03:16:24.80 --> 03:16:25.80 I don't need to shoot today.
03:16:25.80 --> 03:16:26.80 That's a lack of humility.
03:16:26.80 --> 03:16:27.80 Yeah, never.
03:16:27.80 --> 03:16:28.80 Never happened.
03:16:28.80 --> 03:16:29.80 I'm up.
03:16:29.80 --> 03:16:33.80 But I think it's I do want to say, I mean, having you say those nice things about me is like,
03:16:33.80 --> 03:16:36.80 it seems surreal to me.
03:16:36.80 --> 03:16:43.80 I think the key part is like you say you have this consulting business, but you actually, you live it.
03:16:43.80 --> 03:16:45.80 It's not like you're just a lot.
03:16:45.80 --> 03:16:50.80 I know a lot of people who teach who don't follow that same principle, right?
03:16:50.80 --> 03:16:58.80 So I think that because origin has been set up with this approach about maybe your idea is better.
03:16:58.80 --> 03:16:59.80 Maybe I need to listen to this.
03:16:59.80 --> 03:17:02.80 Maybe, you know, whatever just being collaborative.
03:17:02.80 --> 03:17:04.80 And it's, I mean, this is what happens.
03:17:04.80 --> 03:17:12.80 This is the kind of excitement that's generated in the potential that's there with the right attitude and the key pieces in place.
03:17:12.80 --> 03:17:14.80 But you know, you see it.
03:17:14.80 --> 03:17:16.80 I see the key pieces in place and they don't work.
03:17:16.80 --> 03:17:22.80 They don't work because that there's whatever I guess ego or there's who knows what.
03:17:22.80 --> 03:17:23.80 Yeah.
03:17:23.80 --> 03:17:29.80 Well, you, you, at the term I use you, you have to be able to subordinate your ego, which means you actually have to be able to say, you know what?
03:17:29.80 --> 03:17:33.80 But Pete, but it will go with that.
03:17:33.80 --> 03:17:35.80 That, let's go with that.
03:17:35.80 --> 03:17:39.80 I'm, I'm good and not be like, well, actually, I want to do it my way.
03:17:39.80 --> 03:17:40.80 Yeah.
03:17:40.80 --> 03:17:49.80 And here's the thing, if my way is better, then I should be able to articulate that, right, in a way that you go, yeah, you know what that actually makes sense.
03:17:49.80 --> 03:17:51.80 Yeah, that, yeah, I can't argue with that.
03:17:51.80 --> 03:17:52.80 Cool.
03:17:52.80 --> 03:17:53.80 Let's go forward.
03:17:53.80 --> 03:17:55.80 And that's what you need to do.
03:17:55.80 --> 03:17:57.80 Ideas shouldn't be driven by ego.
03:17:57.80 --> 03:17:59.80 We're driven by what's the best idea, right?
03:17:59.80 --> 03:18:03.80 That's how you make things work and that's how we're going to make the best freaking hunting game in the world.
03:18:03.80 --> 03:18:03.80 Yeah.
03:18:03.80 --> 03:18:05.80 And we're going to make it right here in America.
03:18:05.80 --> 03:18:09.80 And we're going to bring back jobs and we need to teach people skills.
03:18:09.80 --> 03:18:10.80 That's what's amazing.
03:18:10.80 --> 03:18:18.80 Is we are, we have a whole group of people that now have a legitimate skill and they have a career.
03:18:18.80 --> 03:18:19.80 Mm-hmm.
03:18:19.80 --> 03:18:26.80 Some of the people that work for us, they, they already knew this, the skill, but now they're able to use it again, because they're not going to be able to use it again.
03:18:26.80 --> 03:18:28.80 Cause a lot of the factories went overseas and now they're able to use it again.
03:18:28.80 --> 03:18:32.80 Some of these younger folks, they're learning it right now.
03:18:32.80 --> 03:18:37.80 I mean, we got a kid that knows how to make, you know, how to weave material.
03:18:37.80 --> 03:18:39.80 It's, it was a lost art.
03:18:39.80 --> 03:18:44.80 And he grabbed it from, from the last guy that really knew how to do it.
03:18:44.80 --> 03:18:48.80 Lenny who actually died, but that skills been captured now.
03:18:48.80 --> 03:18:52.80 And now you got somebody that's going to, that has a freaking awesome skill and
03:18:52.80 --> 03:18:58.80 contribute into the world and contributing to the economy and contributing to the community and contributing to America.
03:18:58.80 --> 03:19:00.80 Like, how awesome is that?
03:19:00.80 --> 03:19:02.80 Yeah, it's incredible.
03:19:02.80 --> 03:19:04.80 All right.
03:19:04.80 --> 03:19:06.80 Um,
03:19:08.80 --> 03:19:09.80 your family.
03:19:09.80 --> 03:19:11.80 Just real quick.
03:19:11.80 --> 03:19:13.80 I just want to give props to your wife.
03:19:13.80 --> 03:19:15.80 Cread it.
03:19:15.80 --> 03:19:21.80 I feel like, uh, sometimes my wife, you know, my wife and my wife married me or met me when I was an E4.
03:19:21.80 --> 03:19:23.80 And the Navy.
03:19:23.80 --> 03:19:24.80 Mm-hmm.
03:19:24.80 --> 03:19:27.80 I always tell her she married me for my money.
03:19:27.80 --> 03:19:33.80 I think I was making like $22,000 a year or something like that when she met me.
03:19:33.80 --> 03:19:34.80 Yeah.
03:19:34.80 --> 03:19:35.80 No pre-not.
03:19:35.80 --> 03:19:36.80 No pre-not.
03:19:36.80 --> 03:19:37.80 Yeah.
03:19:37.80 --> 03:19:39.80 She didn't want half of that.
03:19:39.80 --> 03:19:42.80 She was a bit of a law for yet, obviously.
03:19:42.80 --> 03:19:44.80 So props to her and then, uh, true it.
03:19:44.80 --> 03:19:46.80 I met your son, true it a few times.
03:19:46.80 --> 03:19:48.80 Um, seems like a stud.
03:19:48.80 --> 03:19:49.80 Yeah.
03:19:49.80 --> 03:19:50.80 I know he broke up.
03:19:50.80 --> 03:19:51.80 I broke up.
03:19:51.80 --> 03:19:52.80 Goggen's pull up record.
03:19:52.80 --> 03:19:53.80 He did.
03:19:53.80 --> 03:19:54.80 Yeah.
03:19:54.80 --> 03:19:55.80 Has Goggen's come back on that yet?
03:19:55.80 --> 03:19:56.80 He hasn't.
03:19:56.80 --> 03:19:57.80 No.
03:19:57.80 --> 03:20:01.80 It's a tough one because it even took Goggen's three times to get it.
03:20:01.80 --> 03:20:02.80 Yeah.
03:20:02.80 --> 03:20:03.80 You know, so it's like your body.
03:20:03.80 --> 03:20:04.80 You might want to do it.
03:20:04.80 --> 03:20:06.80 It doesn't mean your body's going to hold up.
03:20:06.80 --> 03:20:07.80 Yeah.
03:20:07.80 --> 03:20:10.80 That's a tough one with those little, you know, your, your grip and your forearm.
03:20:10.80 --> 03:20:11.80 Small muscle.
03:20:11.80 --> 03:20:13.80 And your, and your hands just get trash.
03:20:13.80 --> 03:20:14.80 Yeah.
03:20:14.80 --> 03:20:15.80 Which one?
03:20:15.80 --> 03:20:16.80 People ask that about seal training.
03:20:16.80 --> 03:20:17.80 Like, it's all mental.
03:20:17.80 --> 03:20:18.80 I'm like, well.
03:20:18.80 --> 03:20:21.80 No, not really.
03:20:21.80 --> 03:20:25.80 Because no matter how bad you want to be able to do that rope climb, and I always use rope climb.
03:20:25.80 --> 03:20:27.80 Because rope climb, yeah.
03:20:27.80 --> 03:20:30.80 Rob climb is there's no gutting through a rope climb.
03:20:30.80 --> 03:20:31.80 Right.
03:20:31.80 --> 03:20:33.80 Like you can gut through.
03:20:33.80 --> 03:20:37.80 You can, you can gut through much more of a rock sack, march.
03:20:37.80 --> 03:20:38.80 Hmm.
03:20:38.80 --> 03:20:39.80 Like part of that.
03:20:39.80 --> 03:20:40.80 Oh, cuckoo.
03:20:40.80 --> 03:20:43.80 You can have, you can have like a heat stroke and fall out.
03:20:43.80 --> 03:20:44.80 Yeah.
03:20:44.80 --> 03:20:45.80 But a lot of that is just like gut through it.
03:20:45.80 --> 03:20:46.80 Yeah.
03:20:46.80 --> 03:20:47.80 You can gut through boats on your head.
03:20:47.80 --> 03:20:47.80 Right.
03:20:47.80 --> 03:20:49.80 Like you put the boats on your head during how weak.
03:20:49.80 --> 03:20:51.80 That's just a gut check.
03:20:51.80 --> 03:20:56.80 There's no, if you, if you are a 19 year old American male,
03:20:56.80 --> 03:20:58.80 you can, you can withstand it.
03:20:58.80 --> 03:21:01.80 You can perform the physical activity of boats on your head.
03:21:01.80 --> 03:21:02.80 Right.
03:21:02.80 --> 03:21:03.80 Running around.
03:21:03.80 --> 03:21:05.80 Uh, but a rope climb.
03:21:05.80 --> 03:21:06.80 Yeah.
03:21:06.80 --> 03:21:08.80 Your mind will not get you to the top of that free to rope.
03:21:08.80 --> 03:21:09.80 And your body will.
03:21:09.80 --> 03:21:12.80 So you, you're out there like, oh, it's a mental game.
03:21:12.80 --> 03:21:13.80 Yeah.
03:21:13.80 --> 03:21:13.80 Yeah.
03:21:13.80 --> 03:21:14.80 Cool.
03:21:14.80 --> 03:21:15.80 Climb that rope.
03:21:15.80 --> 03:21:16.80 I really want to climb that rope.
03:21:16.80 --> 03:21:17.80 Yeah.
03:21:17.80 --> 03:21:19.80 But if you can't do it, all the mental strength in the world
03:21:19.80 --> 03:21:21.80 isn't going to get you up that rope.
03:21:21.80 --> 03:21:22.80 And then not.
03:21:22.80 --> 03:21:23.80 Isn't true.
03:21:23.80 --> 03:21:24.80 Got lucky.
03:21:24.80 --> 03:21:26.80 That has body cooperated that day.
03:21:26.80 --> 03:21:27.80 That one day he chose.
03:21:27.80 --> 03:21:28.80 So this is like.
03:21:28.80 --> 03:21:28.80 Yeah.
03:21:28.80 --> 03:21:30.80 Anyway, but he did it.
03:21:30.80 --> 03:21:31.80 Yeah.
03:21:31.80 --> 03:21:32.80 What is it?
03:21:32.80 --> 03:21:35.80 4,241,141 hundred.
03:21:35.80 --> 03:21:36.80 Yeah.
03:21:36.80 --> 03:21:39.80 God can said, then 4,032.
03:21:39.80 --> 03:21:40.80 Yeah.
03:21:40.80 --> 03:21:41.80 But he was supportive of the whole.
03:21:41.80 --> 03:21:42.80 Yeah.
03:21:42.80 --> 03:21:43.80 He was good.
03:21:43.80 --> 03:21:45.80 You know, he met true.
03:21:45.80 --> 03:21:46.80 So he was good with it.
03:21:46.80 --> 03:21:49.80 It's always whenever you see somebody pushing harder.
03:21:49.80 --> 03:21:50.80 Yeah.
03:21:50.80 --> 03:21:53.80 People say in Jiu-Jitsu, I'm going to get you one day to me.
03:21:53.80 --> 03:21:54.80 I'm like, I hope so.
03:21:54.80 --> 03:21:55.80 Yeah.
03:21:55.80 --> 03:21:56.80 And Jiu-Jitsu works.
03:21:56.80 --> 03:21:57.80 Yeah.
03:21:57.80 --> 03:21:58.80 If you work hard, that's what happens.
03:21:58.80 --> 03:21:59.80 Yeah.
03:21:59.80 --> 03:22:00.80 Really.
03:22:00.80 --> 03:22:00.80 Yeah.
03:22:00.80 --> 03:22:03.80 Not going to be mad at someone because they freaking, I'm actually going to be stoked.
03:22:03.80 --> 03:22:04.80 Yeah.
03:22:04.80 --> 03:22:05.80 I'm going to go train harder.
03:22:05.80 --> 03:22:06.80 Train more.
03:22:06.80 --> 03:22:07.80 That's the way it works.
03:22:07.80 --> 03:22:10.80 And then your other son is in the army.
03:22:10.80 --> 03:22:11.80 Yes.
03:22:11.80 --> 03:22:12.80 A ranger.
03:22:12.80 --> 03:22:13.80 Mm-hmm.
03:22:13.80 --> 03:22:14.80 Rangers.
03:22:14.80 --> 03:22:15.80 What's the connection?
03:22:15.80 --> 03:22:19.80 While he was going through, they figured out who he was that you were his dad, or
03:22:19.80 --> 03:22:23.80 some of him, he wanted to be like low pro.
03:22:23.80 --> 03:22:24.80 Yeah.
03:22:24.80 --> 03:22:26.80 Just like Clinton.
03:22:26.80 --> 03:22:29.80 Don't stand out for any reason.
03:22:29.80 --> 03:22:31.80 Don't get any extra attention.
03:22:31.80 --> 03:22:33.80 Don't know what he needs to know when your birthday is.
03:22:33.80 --> 03:22:36.80 Obviously, the worst thing in the military is it seems like.
03:22:36.80 --> 03:22:39.80 Cause people knew you're birthday.
03:22:39.80 --> 03:22:40.80 So, yeah.
03:22:40.80 --> 03:22:42.80 And then you got one more daughter in high school.
03:22:42.80 --> 03:22:43.80 Yeah.
03:22:43.80 --> 03:22:45.34 I'm glad you're doing this year, just senior.
03:22:45.34 --> 03:22:46.14 Right on.
03:22:46.14 --> 03:22:46.98 Awesome.
03:22:46.98 --> 03:22:49.14 Uh, echo.
03:22:49.14 --> 03:22:49.64 Yes.
03:22:49.64 --> 03:22:50.30 You got any questions?
03:22:50.30 --> 03:22:50.64 Yeah.
03:22:50.64 --> 03:22:51.84 Do you actually, how much does it,
03:22:51.84 --> 03:22:53.40 are you ready to be a bow hunter?
03:22:53.40 --> 03:22:54.40 Yeah.
03:22:54.40 --> 03:22:55.92 Oh, actually, which is my way of it.
03:22:55.92 --> 03:22:56.88 Let me ask you a sweet.
03:22:56.88 --> 03:23:01.84 Did I, did I go too hard in the paint on bow hunting as hard?
03:23:01.84 --> 03:23:02.68 Because it's hard.
03:23:02.68 --> 03:23:03.44 It, no, no.
03:23:03.44 --> 03:23:03.96 Okay.
03:23:03.96 --> 03:23:05.40 But it's challenging, but it's rewarding.
03:23:05.40 --> 03:23:07.88 Did that, it seems accurate from my position.
03:23:07.88 --> 03:23:11.04 It catches very limited, by the way, because we all know.
03:23:11.04 --> 03:23:13.32 So that reminds me of a quick question.
03:23:13.32 --> 03:23:18.46 So you know how like, let's say a guy that I know has a crossbow.
03:23:18.46 --> 03:23:22.56 Our bow hunters and crossbows, or crossbow guys, kind of add odds a little bit.
03:23:22.56 --> 03:23:24.80 Crossbow isn't bond.
03:23:24.80 --> 03:23:26.52 So yes, then.
03:23:26.52 --> 03:23:32.68 So if I said hypothetically, that I have a crossbow, would you be kind of mad at me?
03:23:32.68 --> 03:23:35.64 Would you be like, what would I be like one notch lower?
03:23:35.64 --> 03:23:36.64 Yes.
03:23:36.64 --> 03:23:37.64 Okay.
03:23:37.64 --> 03:23:38.64 I understand.
03:23:38.64 --> 03:23:39.64 That was a high point.
03:23:39.64 --> 03:23:40.64 Okay.
03:23:40.64 --> 03:23:42.20 And how much does an arrow weigh?
03:23:42.20 --> 03:23:43.68 Or is it, do they vary?
03:23:43.68 --> 03:23:44.68 Yeah.
03:23:44.68 --> 03:23:46.68 My arrow weighs 540 grains.
03:23:46.68 --> 03:23:48.28 Oh, so there's a girl, okay?
03:23:48.28 --> 03:23:49.28 Yeah, just like bullet.
03:23:49.28 --> 03:23:50.28 Yeah.
03:23:50.28 --> 03:23:52.52 And then the tips you can, you know what?
03:23:52.52 --> 03:23:59.60 Yeah, those can be from 100 grains or even smaller to up to 200 grains.
03:23:59.60 --> 03:24:02.72 And then you have what like the different like broadhead arrow?
03:24:02.72 --> 03:24:03.72 Yeah.
03:24:03.72 --> 03:24:05.24 What is that like the three blades, right?
03:24:05.24 --> 03:24:06.84 They're like blades on the same broadhead.
03:24:06.84 --> 03:24:07.84 Yeah.
03:24:07.84 --> 03:24:09.44 And then what other kind do you use?
03:24:09.44 --> 03:24:11.68 Or is that even a thing?
03:24:11.68 --> 03:24:15.72 Well, there's a field tip that you practice with, so it has no blades.
03:24:15.72 --> 03:24:22.32 And then there's an expandable broadhead, which means that flies with the blades sucked in.
03:24:22.32 --> 03:24:24.64 And then what it hits something, the blades come out.
03:24:24.64 --> 03:24:27.12 They expand out to cut a bigger hole.
03:24:27.12 --> 03:24:31.12 And then there's a fixed blade broadhead, which is what I shoot where the blades are just
03:24:31.12 --> 03:24:32.84 out the whole time.
03:24:32.84 --> 03:24:35.40 And is that like what's just the typical ones?
03:24:35.40 --> 03:24:36.40 Or is there like a bat?
03:24:36.40 --> 03:24:37.76 You know how like in bullets?
03:24:37.76 --> 03:24:38.76 Yeah.
03:24:38.76 --> 03:24:39.76 There's all kinds of broadheads.
03:24:39.76 --> 03:24:47.16 A lot of people are a lot of normally people don't use expandables for elk.
03:24:47.16 --> 03:24:48.36 Some people do.
03:24:48.36 --> 03:24:49.36 And they work.
03:24:49.36 --> 03:24:54.64 I've, for one reason, and Oregon, fixed blade broadheads are the only thing that we're
03:24:54.64 --> 03:24:56.60 legal until like a year or two ago.
03:24:56.60 --> 03:24:58.76 So that's all I've ever used.
03:24:58.76 --> 03:25:02.96 And expandables can cause problems if they hit heavy bone.
03:25:02.96 --> 03:25:07.24 Like that tight bowl of story with an expandable, I wouldn't have got that bowl.
03:25:07.24 --> 03:25:10.000 That my arrow wouldn't have went in 13 inches.
03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:12.72 I wouldn't have been out to get another element at the next day.
03:25:12.72 --> 03:25:15.52 So it'll loss that bowl with an expandable.
03:25:15.52 --> 03:25:22.12 And expandables also can hit, if you hit like a, maybe like a twig, which is already like
03:25:22.12 --> 03:25:24.28 you, you already got problems if you hit a twig.
03:25:24.28 --> 03:25:25.28 Or something else.
03:25:25.28 --> 03:25:30.24 But it can open those things up maybe early and now like you can have more problems
03:25:30.24 --> 03:25:31.24 too.
03:25:31.24 --> 03:25:32.24 Yeah.
03:25:32.24 --> 03:25:34.56 But the expandable kind of big hole.
03:25:34.56 --> 03:25:38.16 Open a big hole like big.
03:25:38.16 --> 03:25:43.72 So just feel tip expandable and then fix blade.
03:25:43.72 --> 03:25:45.48 So is there like exotic?
03:25:45.48 --> 03:25:46.48 Okay.
03:25:46.48 --> 03:25:47.48 So let's say I know what you're saying.
03:25:47.48 --> 03:25:50.76 He's wants to know if there's like a, the twig's on the other side.
03:25:50.76 --> 03:25:53.88 There's design your broadheads or whatever.
03:25:53.88 --> 03:25:54.88 And go like that.
03:25:54.88 --> 03:25:55.88 Rambo.
03:25:55.88 --> 03:25:56.88 That's what I was going to say.
03:25:56.88 --> 03:25:57.88 Like you got the explosive.
03:25:57.88 --> 03:26:00.68 You got to say all these other ones I would ever.
03:26:00.68 --> 03:26:03.000 Like, there is it like that with arrows or what?
03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:05.000 You know, there hasn't been an explosive.
03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:06.000 I've done some.
03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:08.000 There has to be no.
03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:09.000 I did.
03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:10.000 I did.
03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:11.000 I did.
03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:12.000 I did.
03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:16.68 There's a guy Richard Ryan and he used to, he might have been an original investor or I
03:26:16.68 --> 03:26:17.68 don't, I came in anyway.
03:26:17.68 --> 03:26:20.44 He is part of Black Rifle for a while.
03:26:20.44 --> 03:26:26.44 And he, we did some trick filming with, with, with the, archery and, and Bo shots and
03:26:26.44 --> 03:26:27.44 different things.
03:26:27.44 --> 03:26:28.44 I got shot.
03:26:28.44 --> 03:26:32.48 I shot cheese off a mouse trap that he was holding.
03:26:32.48 --> 03:26:36.40 And so we're trying to see if I can get the cheese off of it before the mouse trap got
03:26:36.40 --> 03:26:37.40 my arrow.
03:26:37.40 --> 03:26:38.92 So he held it and I shot it.
03:26:38.92 --> 03:26:44.24 But another one he did was we put propane flame that shot up and then a paint can
03:26:44.24 --> 03:26:45.24 behind it.
03:26:45.24 --> 03:26:50.84 So the arrow would go through the, propane flame, pull the flame and then puncture
03:26:50.84 --> 03:26:53.52 the paint can then it explode.
03:26:53.52 --> 03:26:55.04 And it's like a huge explosion.
03:26:55.04 --> 03:26:59.40 So I made a joke that was like, I shouldn't a rambo brought him.
03:26:59.40 --> 03:27:05.52 But there hasn't been a rambo brought head yet like in, I think is Rambo 2.
03:27:05.52 --> 03:27:06.92 One of the greatest films of all time.
03:27:06.92 --> 03:27:07.92 Yes, sir.
03:27:07.92 --> 03:27:08.92 Yes.
03:27:08.92 --> 03:27:16.68 But there has been one where they're shooting is like a 357 shell casing or shell on the
03:27:16.68 --> 03:27:17.80 end of an arrow.
03:27:17.80 --> 03:27:20.60 And it would like, I think they killed some hogs with it.
03:27:20.60 --> 03:27:22.92 Like it hit the hog and then fire the primer.
03:27:22.92 --> 03:27:23.92 Yeah.
03:27:23.92 --> 03:27:25.64 I've never used one.
03:27:25.64 --> 03:27:28.04 But that's the closest we got to Rambo.
03:27:28.04 --> 03:27:29.04 I could see where.
03:27:29.04 --> 03:27:30.04 All right.
03:27:30.04 --> 03:27:33.08 Since I know echo pretty well, I can see he's got all kinds of like he wants to have
03:27:33.08 --> 03:27:35.36 a selection of the party.
03:27:35.36 --> 03:27:37.36 Designer, yeah, broadheads.
03:27:37.36 --> 03:27:39.20 But that's different ones, yes, sir.
03:27:39.20 --> 03:27:40.76 So there's no twisty one.
03:27:40.76 --> 03:27:43.60 You know, like I figured that would be a thing.
03:27:43.60 --> 03:27:48.24 The broadheads I use actually the blades come off at an angle.
03:27:48.24 --> 03:27:53.04 And I think it enhances, because when an arrow flies for to be accurate, there has to
03:27:53.04 --> 03:27:54.88 be helical on it.
03:27:54.88 --> 03:27:56.72 Just like rifling on a barrel.
03:27:56.72 --> 03:27:59.48 So that's what it gives that direction.
03:27:59.48 --> 03:28:04.16 This is like a so a muzzle loader if it's just a ball isn't very accurate.
03:28:04.16 --> 03:28:05.16 But that twist.
03:28:05.16 --> 03:28:07.16 So same thing with the narrowest and principle.
03:28:07.16 --> 03:28:11.96 The flesh on the back of the arrow is what gives direction to that arrow.
03:28:11.96 --> 03:28:14.20 Well, my broadheads come off at an angle.
03:28:14.20 --> 03:28:15.84 And I think it enhances.
03:28:15.84 --> 03:28:18.80 So when it hits an animal, it's twisting as it cuts.
03:28:18.80 --> 03:28:24.48 And I think it cuts a more devastating womb channel because it's going like that.
03:28:24.48 --> 03:28:31.28 So it cuts a hole instead of just slices.
03:28:31.28 --> 03:28:33.88 You're going to get some things for your crossbow growth.
03:28:33.88 --> 03:28:40.40 I'm going to look deeper into this stuff.
03:28:40.40 --> 03:28:41.40 Right on.
03:28:41.40 --> 03:28:43.40 I like it.
03:28:43.40 --> 03:28:46.36 Cam, any closing thoughts and things we missed?
03:28:46.36 --> 03:28:48.48 Like I said, it's an honor to be here.
03:28:48.48 --> 03:28:54.88 I mean, I don't feel worthy of sitting with you guys, honestly.
03:28:54.88 --> 03:28:57.44 This is, I never thought I'd be here.
03:28:57.44 --> 03:29:01.64 I never thought I'd be here talking to you guys or larger than life for me and for a lot
03:29:01.64 --> 03:29:02.96 of others.
03:29:02.96 --> 03:29:06.56 We actually had this training at work not long ago.
03:29:06.56 --> 03:29:11.36 And the trainer mentioned this Navy Seal, Jocco.
03:29:11.36 --> 03:29:17.36 And he's like, and I was just like, I know Jocco.
03:29:17.36 --> 03:29:21.44 So yeah, this seems, you know, I used to reel earlier, but it does.
03:29:21.44 --> 03:29:23.08 It feels, I don't know.
03:29:23.08 --> 03:29:24.44 I'm honored to be here.
03:29:24.44 --> 03:29:28.84 I'm honored that you looked at my book and you actually gave me advice when I was
03:29:28.84 --> 03:29:31.08 just like in a publisher.
03:29:31.08 --> 03:29:33.04 You guys use the same publishers, me?
03:29:33.04 --> 03:29:35.12 Same publisher, same marons.
03:29:35.12 --> 03:29:39.84 And so you gave me some great advice there and you've been a resource and now we're partners.
03:29:39.84 --> 03:29:43.000 And it doesn't feel like my life.
03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:44.000 But thank you.
03:29:44.000 --> 03:29:47.32 Well, right, all man, as I mentioned earlier, I feel the same way.
03:29:47.32 --> 03:29:54.24 Like here, I am talking with the freaking world, world class dude and it's just awesome.
03:29:54.24 --> 03:29:55.88 So thanks for coming on.
03:29:55.88 --> 03:29:58.52 Thanks for sharing your lessons learned.
03:29:58.52 --> 03:30:04.96 And thanks for your encouragement to me and so many other people.
03:30:04.96 --> 03:30:06.16 Like there's so many other people.
03:30:06.16 --> 03:30:11.20 I know that you inspire so many people to get on the path of bow hunting, but not just
03:30:11.20 --> 03:30:14.20 get on the path of bow hunting, just to get on a better path in their life.
03:30:14.20 --> 03:30:19.48 And I think this book is going to do that even more.
03:30:19.48 --> 03:30:25.80 And as you said, it's an honor to be working with you, partner with you, and to take, you
03:30:25.80 --> 03:30:31.000 know, what this thing is, you know, talk to Kip, talk to Pete, I can feel it.
03:30:31.000 --> 03:30:32.24 There's like a rocket.
03:30:32.24 --> 03:30:33.24 It's like a rocket.
03:30:33.24 --> 03:30:34.88 You can watch the fuse.
03:30:34.88 --> 03:30:36.44 It's burned in right now.
03:30:36.44 --> 03:30:42.08 The temperatures come in. We're testing product. Like we're ready to watch this thing go
03:30:42.08 --> 03:30:43.08 Richter.
03:30:43.08 --> 03:30:45.08 So thanks for what you do.
03:30:45.08 --> 03:30:48.80 And thanks for inspiring people all over the world.
03:30:48.80 --> 03:30:49.80 Thank you.
03:30:49.80 --> 03:30:50.80 Take care.
03:30:50.80 --> 03:30:51.80 Take care.
03:30:51.80 --> 03:30:52.80 Thank you guys.
03:30:52.80 --> 03:30:53.80 I appreciate it.
03:30:53.80 --> 03:30:55.80 Right on.
03:30:55.80 --> 03:31:00.24 And with that, Cameron Haynes has left the building.
03:31:00.24 --> 03:31:01.56 Echo Charles.
03:31:01.56 --> 03:31:03.36 Are you ready to become a bow hunter?
03:31:03.36 --> 03:31:04.36 I think so.
03:31:04.36 --> 03:31:05.36 Yeah.
03:31:05.36 --> 03:31:13.36 I was trying to think of Crossbow hunting versus bow hunting.
03:31:13.36 --> 03:31:18.08 And I was trying to think of what a good example would be.
03:31:18.08 --> 03:31:20.64 I kind of landed on surfing versus body boarding.
03:31:20.64 --> 03:31:22.44 That makes sense to me.
03:31:22.44 --> 03:31:23.44 Thank you, man.
03:31:23.44 --> 03:31:28.80 No disrespect to body boarding.
03:31:28.80 --> 03:31:33.44 But something along those lines a little bit where let's face it.
03:31:33.44 --> 03:31:34.44 Let's face it.
03:31:34.44 --> 03:31:39.20 More skill to surf than body board fundamentally.
03:31:39.20 --> 03:31:40.20 Sure.
03:31:40.20 --> 03:31:43.60 No, again, no disrespect to the spongers at the highest level.
03:31:43.60 --> 03:31:45.64 How they're getting after it.
03:31:45.64 --> 03:31:47.72 The fact is I don't know.
03:31:47.72 --> 03:31:51.24 But it seems that that's the case.
03:31:51.24 --> 03:31:53.16 So even like, yeah, okay.
03:31:53.16 --> 03:31:56.28 So I know guy with a crossbow.
03:31:56.28 --> 03:31:58.16 And he let me shoot it from time to time.
03:31:58.16 --> 03:32:02.08 And I have shot a bow before.
03:32:02.08 --> 03:32:03.32 When did you shoot a bow?
03:32:03.32 --> 03:32:05.92 Actually, the last time I did was about a week ago.
03:32:05.92 --> 03:32:06.76 Where?
03:32:06.76 --> 03:32:07.76 At Greg Train's house.
03:32:07.76 --> 03:32:08.76 Oh, that's right.
03:32:08.76 --> 03:32:09.76 Greg Train's on that.
03:32:09.76 --> 03:32:11.76 Yeah, his arms were a little short of my hands.
03:32:11.76 --> 03:32:13.92 So it was like, but then I shot one at the origin camp.
03:32:13.92 --> 03:32:14.92 One of the guys.
03:32:14.92 --> 03:32:15.92 No one.
03:32:15.92 --> 03:32:16.92 Yeah.
03:32:16.92 --> 03:32:17.92 And I dig it.
03:32:17.92 --> 03:32:19.64 I'm with it, man.
03:32:19.64 --> 03:32:23.04 I made a bullseye to by the way, but it's neither here nor there.
03:32:23.04 --> 03:32:24.80 Just naturally skilled like that.
03:32:24.80 --> 03:32:28.32 So why do you buy a crossbow?
03:32:28.32 --> 03:32:31.28 The guy who has had the crossbow from before.
03:32:31.28 --> 03:32:36.40 Either way, yes, the bow seemed or has a lot more going on.
03:32:36.40 --> 03:32:37.40 For sure.
03:32:37.40 --> 03:32:39.56 So I can dig how you'd say that.
03:32:39.56 --> 03:32:40.56 It's not.
03:32:40.56 --> 03:32:42.96 I was gonna think a ghee versus no ghee, but it's not that.
03:32:42.96 --> 03:32:43.96 Because no ghee, they're both.
03:32:43.96 --> 03:32:44.96 They're both highly respected.
03:32:44.96 --> 03:32:45.96 Yes.
03:32:45.96 --> 03:32:46.96 Really respected.
03:32:46.96 --> 03:32:49.80 And difficult.
03:32:49.80 --> 03:32:52.16 And there's a lot to both of them.
03:32:52.16 --> 03:32:54.16 Regardless of perception.
03:32:54.16 --> 03:32:55.16 That's okay.
03:32:55.16 --> 03:32:56.16 I found it.
03:32:56.16 --> 03:32:57.16 I think I found it.
03:32:57.16 --> 03:33:00.40 Skate boarding versus scooters.
03:33:00.40 --> 03:33:01.40 Like the two wheelers.
03:33:01.40 --> 03:33:05.68 So that's what you're crossbow is.
03:33:05.68 --> 03:33:09.56 You're on a razor scooter taking up a room in the half pipe.
03:33:09.56 --> 03:33:10.56 Yeah.
03:33:10.56 --> 03:33:12.80 That's what's going on.
03:33:12.80 --> 03:33:13.80 Did I make?
03:33:13.80 --> 03:33:17.96 And I asked you this during the podcast, but it's so hard.
03:33:17.96 --> 03:33:20.36 But hunting is so hard.
03:33:20.36 --> 03:33:25.60 I hope I didn't discourage anyone from trying it and doing it.
03:33:25.60 --> 03:33:27.92 But you got to recognize there's a lot going on, man.
03:33:27.92 --> 03:33:29.48 This is not an easy game to play.
03:33:29.48 --> 03:33:30.48 Oh, yeah.
03:33:30.48 --> 03:33:31.48 That's freaking hard.
03:33:31.48 --> 03:33:32.48 Oh, it's real hard.
03:33:32.48 --> 03:33:40.72 Actually, even that opening that you opened with, it made me physically feel probably
03:33:40.72 --> 03:33:44.92 a good element of how hard it is because I remember back, you know, like when I'm thinking,
03:33:44.92 --> 03:33:48.40 okay, the first time I ever shot a bow, I'm like, okay, this is like, dude, I got to pay attention
03:33:48.40 --> 03:33:49.40 to all this stuff.
03:33:49.40 --> 03:33:51.40 And then I got to aim in a certain way and all this stuff.
03:33:51.40 --> 03:33:55.28 And then that's just my, and there's not to mention like the 1000 things that I don't
03:33:55.28 --> 03:33:56.68 know about.
03:33:56.68 --> 03:34:01.000 And then you want to mix that with actually going out and doing it with any animal.
03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:02.000 Any animal.
03:34:02.000 --> 03:34:03.96 It's, it's crazy.
03:34:03.96 --> 03:34:07.40 And then you got to learn about all these different animals because they all act different
03:34:07.40 --> 03:34:14.44 by the way, like a bear does this, you know, elk does that and a deer does something else.
03:34:14.44 --> 03:34:16.08 Like they all have different reactions.
03:34:16.08 --> 03:34:17.76 They all have different senses.
03:34:17.76 --> 03:34:23.12 So, and then you got to like I said, then once you shoot that animal, then you got to
03:34:23.12 --> 03:34:25.28 go find that thing.
03:34:25.28 --> 03:34:30.96 If you got a shot that was good enough to make the animal bleed.
03:34:30.96 --> 03:34:34.16 So the thing is, yes, extremely challenging.
03:34:34.16 --> 03:34:37.64 Other side of that spectrum, it's an awesome reward.
03:34:37.64 --> 03:34:38.64 Awesome reward.
03:34:38.64 --> 03:34:41.48 You asked, do I want to be a bow hunter now?
03:34:41.48 --> 03:34:42.48 Prunk kind of.
03:34:42.48 --> 03:34:43.48 Right.
03:34:43.48 --> 03:34:47.20 And here's the thing, like I think, and this is an actually, and this didn't start right
03:34:47.20 --> 03:34:48.20 now though.
03:34:48.20 --> 03:34:53.16 I think right, right one Cameron Hayne, even Judd, John Dead Dudley, when they kind of came
03:34:53.16 --> 03:34:56.36 up, exploded onto the scene, bro, I felt it then.
03:34:56.36 --> 03:34:59.40 No, it wasn't like I kind of dope.
03:34:59.40 --> 03:35:03.08 And you know, you see other people doing it and then talk about it, kind of just kind of
03:35:03.08 --> 03:35:07.72 exposes it in a way that, you know, I haven't been exposed to it.
03:35:07.72 --> 03:35:10.76 And I'm sure a lot of other people seem to seem to deal because I noticed a lot of people
03:35:10.76 --> 03:35:13.08 picked it up after that kind of started.
03:35:13.08 --> 03:35:14.08 Yeah, for sure.
03:35:14.08 --> 03:35:15.08 I'm wonderful.
03:35:15.08 --> 03:35:16.08 Yeah, I feel it.
03:35:16.08 --> 03:35:17.08 I feel it.
03:35:17.08 --> 03:35:18.08 So yeah, I do.
03:35:18.08 --> 03:35:19.36 All right, we're good.
03:35:19.36 --> 03:35:24.28 Hey, uh, gonna need to get in good shape if you're gonna do any kind of hunting or if
03:35:24.28 --> 03:35:28.000 you can do any kind of living, by the way, just being alive, I recommend you being
03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:29.000 good shape.
03:35:29.000 --> 03:35:31.40 Just like it pays to be in good shape when you're out of the mountain, maybe you could get
03:35:31.40 --> 03:35:34.80 that one tenth of a percent that's going to make the difference.
03:35:34.80 --> 03:35:37.56 What's that one tenth of a percent in life?
03:35:37.56 --> 03:35:38.60 Let's think about that.
03:35:38.60 --> 03:35:44.24 So that means staying physically active, healthy, working out, pushing yourself.
03:35:44.24 --> 03:35:45.88 You know what that means?
03:35:45.88 --> 03:35:46.88 Yes.
03:35:46.88 --> 03:35:47.88 What does it mean?
03:35:47.88 --> 03:35:49.88 It means a lot of things.
03:35:49.88 --> 03:35:55.64 But, you know, so with my kids and you can kind of mention this before, right, where
03:35:55.64 --> 03:35:59.12 with kids like they're watching you.
03:35:59.12 --> 03:36:02.16 So sometimes they're gonna be like, oh, I see, you know, dad's doing this, so they might
03:36:02.16 --> 03:36:05.72 want to try to imitate a little bit, just to see what the what the hype is all about, you
03:36:05.72 --> 03:36:06.72 know?
03:36:06.72 --> 03:36:11.48 And so my kids in my very specific situation, like they'll start jumping in on the
03:36:11.48 --> 03:36:14.96 workouts or whatever, sort of making little goals and stuff like that.
03:36:14.96 --> 03:36:22.80 And they have to endure things like domes or their domes.
03:36:22.80 --> 03:36:24.04 That's basically what it is, right?
03:36:24.04 --> 03:36:26.64 But when your kid, domes is like, you know what that is.
03:36:26.64 --> 03:36:28.84 You just think it's like, your body's breaking down.
03:36:28.84 --> 03:36:29.84 You're like, that's a big truth.
03:36:29.84 --> 03:36:30.84 I got domes.
03:36:30.84 --> 03:36:31.84 What up?
03:36:31.84 --> 03:36:32.84 You know, not yet.
03:36:32.84 --> 03:36:36.60 Until you explain it or whatever, but either way, you get sorness.
03:36:36.60 --> 03:36:40.52 It's not all like freaking bulls eyes is what I'm saying.
03:36:40.52 --> 03:36:41.52 True.
03:36:41.52 --> 03:36:43.40 You know, you get some pain.
03:36:43.40 --> 03:36:44.40 Get some aches.
03:36:44.40 --> 03:36:46.08 Some good days and bad days.
03:36:46.08 --> 03:36:47.08 It's what I'm saying.
03:36:47.08 --> 03:36:48.08 Takes effort.
03:36:48.08 --> 03:36:53.04 Well, when you start feeling some of those bad days, maybe you need some more protein,
03:36:53.04 --> 03:36:54.04 right?
03:36:54.04 --> 03:36:58.12 Get yourself some milk, get yourself some joint warfare, get yourself some super
03:36:58.12 --> 03:37:04.32 curl, get yourself some jocquaffeeal, jocquaffeeal.com, make that happen out of the
03:37:04.32 --> 03:37:05.32 gate.
03:37:05.32 --> 03:37:06.32 Yep.
03:37:06.32 --> 03:37:11.84 We got new flavors on the energy drinks that are coming.
03:37:11.84 --> 03:37:13.40 All the flavors are new.
03:37:13.40 --> 03:37:14.40 Right.
03:37:14.40 --> 03:37:17.32 So again, you mentioned that before we started recording.
03:37:17.32 --> 03:37:20.80 And it's the way you said, okay, took clarify, they're not new flavors.
03:37:20.80 --> 03:37:24.44 The same flavors redefined or remastered.
03:37:24.44 --> 03:37:25.44 Remastered.
03:37:25.44 --> 03:37:26.44 Yeah.
03:37:26.44 --> 03:37:28.000 And even you could just say, mastered.
03:37:28.000 --> 03:37:30.32 Because here's the thing.
03:37:30.32 --> 03:37:32.96 The initial flavor profiles.
03:37:32.96 --> 03:37:34.60 Let's call them.
03:37:34.60 --> 03:37:37.40 They were based on my sense of taste.
03:37:37.40 --> 03:37:39.80 Which my sense of taste, you know, not eat a bunch of sweets.
03:37:39.80 --> 03:37:42.08 All the sudden, I drink something with monk fruit in it.
03:37:42.08 --> 03:37:43.08 I'm like, whoa.
03:37:43.08 --> 03:37:44.08 I'm used to drinking water.
03:37:44.08 --> 03:37:45.08 Right.
03:37:45.08 --> 03:37:48.64 So you put a little monk fruit in something.
03:37:48.64 --> 03:37:53.08 And I think I'm, I think I'm having a freaking, uh, a dang.
03:37:53.08 --> 03:37:57.52 It's just a coker cola, right?
03:37:57.52 --> 03:38:01.28 With a little tiny one-tenth to one percent of some monk fruit in there, I think I
03:38:01.28 --> 03:38:02.28 got a coker cola.
03:38:02.28 --> 03:38:03.48 I'm like, yeah, this tastes delicious.
03:38:03.48 --> 03:38:04.48 This is so sweet.
03:38:04.48 --> 03:38:05.48 I was wrong.
03:38:05.48 --> 03:38:06.48 Yeah.
03:38:06.48 --> 03:38:12.84 So we've adjusted so that they taste even better, kind of hit in the shelves.
03:38:12.84 --> 03:38:17.24 Right now, depending on where you're at, depending on, yeah, it's depending on where you're
03:38:17.24 --> 03:38:18.24 at.
03:38:18.24 --> 03:38:23.40 But as you're hearing this, it's time to start getting back into the game.
03:38:23.40 --> 03:38:27.24 If you didn't like the original flavors, we made them all, they taste, here's the thing,
03:38:27.24 --> 03:38:29.72 we're going to win on taste now.
03:38:29.72 --> 03:38:33.000 Before we were winning on this is good for you.
03:38:33.000 --> 03:38:34.000 Everything else is poisonous.
03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:35.60 It's actually going to kill you.
03:38:35.60 --> 03:38:36.60 Yeah.
03:38:36.60 --> 03:38:37.60 We were winning on that.
03:38:37.60 --> 03:38:39.72 And winning on that.
03:38:39.72 --> 03:38:41.44 But you also got a win on taste.
03:38:41.44 --> 03:38:42.84 So now we're going to win on taste.
03:38:42.84 --> 03:38:45.84 We're winning on all fronts.
03:38:45.84 --> 03:38:46.84 So there you go.
03:38:46.84 --> 03:38:47.84 DrFuel.com.
03:38:47.84 --> 03:38:48.84 I will.
03:38:48.84 --> 03:38:49.84 Coming your way.
03:38:49.84 --> 03:38:54.20 Second, that being someone who has tasted the new flavor, I will agree with that.
03:38:54.20 --> 03:38:56.000 Wait, flavor, or flavors.
03:38:56.000 --> 03:38:57.48 Because I've tasted all new flavors in the wrong way.
03:38:57.48 --> 03:38:58.84 Well, I just tasted the mango.
03:38:58.84 --> 03:39:00.84 So, oh, no, no, the mango in the orange.
03:39:00.84 --> 03:39:01.84 So, yeah.

03:40:30.20 --> 03:40:33.44 So this is America.
03:40:33.44 --> 03:40:36.08 This is America.
03:40:36.08 --> 03:40:38.92 We're not doing that.
03:40:38.92 --> 03:40:43.04 We've got American made stuff supported.
03:40:43.04 --> 03:40:44.48 It's George and USA.com.
03:40:44.48 --> 03:40:45.48 This is America.
03:40:45.48 --> 03:40:46.48 Yeah.
03:40:46.48 --> 03:40:47.48 Blacks.
03:40:47.48 --> 03:40:51.08 You kind of sounded like Pete right there when you said it like that.
03:40:51.08 --> 03:40:52.08 Does Pete say it like that?
03:40:52.08 --> 03:40:53.08 Yes.
03:40:53.08 --> 03:40:54.64 Come on, I've been heard them say that.
03:40:54.64 --> 03:40:56.64 Not to mention, you did this stuff as well on there.
03:40:56.64 --> 03:40:57.64 Yeah.
03:40:57.64 --> 03:40:58.64 American made.
03:40:58.64 --> 03:40:59.64 That's basically it.
03:40:59.64 --> 03:41:00.64 Oh yeah.
03:41:00.64 --> 03:41:02.64 Yeah, we were doing, you know, when it would be called spring cleaning.
03:41:02.64 --> 03:41:04.84 You know, I was observing.
03:41:04.84 --> 03:41:11.12 But it was going on at my house and my wife brought out all the keys that I have to
03:41:11.12 --> 03:41:13.48 kind of organize or whatever.
03:41:13.48 --> 03:41:15.56 And yeah, I saw the comparison.
03:41:15.56 --> 03:41:17.36 You know, they still have the keys.
03:41:17.36 --> 03:41:19.40 Apparently, I didn't know.
03:41:19.40 --> 03:41:21.16 Are they in the garbage now?
03:41:21.16 --> 03:41:22.56 In the garage on the floor.
03:41:22.56 --> 03:41:24.16 So you're heading to the garbage.
03:41:24.16 --> 03:41:25.16 Yeah.
03:41:25.16 --> 03:41:26.16 Exactly.
03:41:26.16 --> 03:41:27.16 That's so happy.
03:41:27.16 --> 03:41:28.16 I don't have any other keys anymore.
03:41:28.16 --> 03:41:29.16 Yeah.
03:41:29.16 --> 03:41:30.16 It's kind of worthless.
03:41:30.16 --> 03:41:32.16 You know, no offense, but they're kind of worthless kind of.
03:41:32.16 --> 03:41:37.16 It shows you how malleable the human mind is because we all just thought that's just
03:41:37.16 --> 03:41:38.16 how it's going to be.
03:41:38.16 --> 03:41:43.20 Just a just a wearing the most uncomfortable thing on your body while you're trying to
03:41:43.20 --> 03:41:45.20 be athletic and moving around.
03:41:45.20 --> 03:41:46.20 No reason for that.
03:41:46.20 --> 03:41:47.20 No reason for that.
03:41:47.20 --> 03:41:48.20 OrgeneUSA.com.
03:41:48.20 --> 03:41:49.20 That's true.
03:41:49.20 --> 03:41:54.16 Also, if you want to represent while we're on this path, it's hard path.
03:41:54.16 --> 03:41:55.48 That's one might say.
03:41:55.48 --> 03:42:00.80 But hey, you want to represent go to jockelstore.com so you can get your apparel.
03:42:00.80 --> 03:42:01.80 This one equals freedom.
03:42:01.80 --> 03:42:04.08 It got some new discipline equals freedom.
03:42:04.08 --> 03:42:05.08 Standard issue.
03:42:05.08 --> 03:42:07.80 By the way, back to old school.
03:42:07.80 --> 03:42:11.84 I don't want to do too much detail, but it's a basic design.
03:42:11.84 --> 03:42:13.84 This one equals freedom.
03:42:13.84 --> 03:42:17.80 And there's certain layers on there that you'll probably know this school.
03:42:17.80 --> 03:42:21.84 Say, if you have a keen eye, you'll notice the layers done the last week.
03:42:21.84 --> 03:42:22.84 Got some new stuff on there.
03:42:22.84 --> 03:42:24.68 Anyway, if you want to represent, that's where you can get it.
03:42:24.68 --> 03:42:25.68 Jockelstore.
03:42:25.68 --> 03:42:29.60 There's also the shirt locker, which is your subscriptions shirts.
03:42:29.60 --> 03:42:32.64 For every month, good design.
03:42:32.64 --> 03:42:33.64 unique.
03:42:33.64 --> 03:42:35.48 unique, creative fun.
03:42:35.48 --> 03:42:38.04 In fact, this last one, I'm not going to tell you what it is.
03:42:38.04 --> 03:42:39.04 Maybe I will.
03:42:39.04 --> 03:42:43.28 But it was one of the, you know, every month, so all you'll get one, where people will
03:42:43.28 --> 03:42:47.000 actually go out of their way to send you messages with them wearing the shirt.
03:42:47.000 --> 03:42:49.84 Say, hey, you knocked it out of the park with this one.
03:42:49.84 --> 03:42:52.12 I got that this past month.
03:42:52.12 --> 03:42:53.92 Or this current month.
03:42:53.92 --> 03:42:55.44 Where have I seen it yet?
03:42:55.44 --> 03:42:56.44 Nope.
03:42:56.44 --> 03:42:57.44 So it's not released yet.
03:42:57.44 --> 03:42:58.44 This is not released.
03:42:58.44 --> 03:42:59.76 Now everything's live.
03:42:59.76 --> 03:43:02.84 So the first of the month, you, I don't care if you sign up on the first of the month,
03:43:02.84 --> 03:43:05.28 or you, your order is on the first month.
03:43:05.28 --> 03:43:06.28 It's that month.
03:43:06.28 --> 03:43:07.28 It's all current.
03:43:07.28 --> 03:43:09.44 So yeah, it's this month.
03:43:09.44 --> 03:43:10.44 What does it make?
03:43:10.44 --> 03:43:11.44 Yep.
03:43:11.44 --> 03:43:15.04 That make sure we're just going to be very high esteemed.
03:43:15.04 --> 03:43:16.04 Either way.
03:43:16.04 --> 03:43:17.44 Yeah, Jockelstore.com.
03:43:17.44 --> 03:43:20.08 Yeah, I need if you can subscribe to the shirt locker.
03:43:20.08 --> 03:43:22.52 And you can subscribe to the podcast.
03:43:22.52 --> 03:43:23.52 Legally.

03:43:24.52 --> 03:43:28.12 Leave a review or whatever they say to do.
03:43:28.12 --> 03:43:29.12 Yeah.
03:43:29.12 --> 03:43:31.12 Jockelornerground.com.
03:43:31.12 --> 03:43:33.12 We're doing a lot of Q&A on that.
03:43:33.12 --> 03:43:37.52 We're also addressing some of the lives.
03:43:37.52 --> 03:43:40.36 Some of the aspects of life that we can gain an edge on that maybe we're not thinking
03:43:40.36 --> 03:43:41.36 about.
03:43:41.36 --> 03:43:42.36 Yeah.
03:43:42.36 --> 03:43:43.36 Right.
03:43:43.36 --> 03:43:45.48 So that's probably a good thing to pay attention to.
03:43:45.48 --> 03:43:49.44 The reason we have that is there's strange things going on in the world.
03:43:49.44 --> 03:43:50.84 There's censorship.
03:43:50.84 --> 03:43:53.28 People are getting banned, shadow banned for home on yards.
03:43:53.28 --> 03:43:56.92 We don't have any control over the platform that you're listening to this on right now.
03:43:56.92 --> 03:43:59.48 We do have control over Jockelornerground.com.
03:43:59.48 --> 03:44:02.28 So if you want to help us out there, you can sign up for that.
03:44:02.28 --> 03:44:05.44 It costs $8.18 a month.

03:44:20.88 --> 03:44:21.88 Yes.
03:44:21.88 --> 03:44:22.88 Yeah.
03:44:22.88 --> 03:44:23.88 So about halfway through.
03:44:23.88 --> 03:44:27.96 Eric and he had to take it down.
03:44:27.96 --> 03:44:35.16 Yeah, you don't want to let the aesthetic value diminish because of the functional value.
03:44:35.16 --> 03:44:40.08 You seem to say it's not cold or if you're not enduring the elements, you might not need that.
03:44:40.08 --> 03:44:41.40 So I'm going to put that on the side.
03:44:41.40 --> 03:44:42.40 You're going to see.

03:46:40.24 --> 03:46:44.24 So I've been in this game for a while, been around you for a while.
03:46:44.24 --> 03:46:49.80 And there is stuff within the last one month, actually more than one thing, by the way,
03:46:49.80 --> 03:46:53.64 that hit me in a different way to make me realize it.
03:46:53.64 --> 03:46:58.28 And it's stuff you've been saying in one way or another for the whole time years, by
03:46:58.28 --> 03:46:59.28 the way.
03:46:59.28 --> 03:47:02.68 And then you'll say it a certain way, or you'll interact with someone a certain way,
03:47:02.68 --> 03:47:04.48 and be like, oh, that's what he meant.
03:47:04.48 --> 03:47:09.48 Oh, that's how, you know, so you'll come across things that will be revelations over
03:47:09.48 --> 03:47:10.48 time.

03:48:31.16 --> 03:48:34.52 Kind of seems like it's moving in the right direction a little bit more.
03:48:34.52 --> 03:48:37.64 It was kind of getting a little sketchy for a while.
03:48:37.64 --> 03:48:41.24 So I've been hammered on Twitter a little bit.
03:48:41.24 --> 03:48:42.24 Echoes there.

03:48:50.28 --> 03:48:51.76 The algorithm.
03:48:51.76 --> 03:48:53.80 The free dopamine hits you're getting.

03:49:54.20 --> 03:49:55.76 Actually, no, I don't think I covered any of them.
03:49:55.76 --> 03:50:00.72 But there are these short little sections that provide some insight into cams mindset
03:50:00.72 --> 03:50:06.76 that I think will be helpful to anybody that's trying to get their mind right.
03:50:06.76 --> 03:50:10.44 Here's one of those little sections.
03:50:10.44 --> 03:50:11.44 It goes like this.

03:50:33.60 --> 03:50:36.16 Nobody really cares about your goals.
03:50:36.16 --> 03:50:41.84 Nobody cares about your excuses for not achieving recent success.
03:50:41.84 --> 03:50:44.60 Yesterday means nothing.
03:50:44.60 --> 03:50:46.44 Recent failure.
03:50:46.44 --> 03:50:50.04 Yesterday means nothing.
03:50:50.04 --> 03:50:53.44 Give all you have today.
03:50:53.44 --> 03:50:56.68 What you've accomplished in the past means nothing.
03:50:56.68 --> 03:50:58.80 We don't rest on laurels.
03:50:58.80 --> 03:51:04.08 It is time to work.
03:51:04.08 --> 03:51:31.04 And until next time, Zekko and Joko out.
