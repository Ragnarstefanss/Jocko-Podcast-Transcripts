00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.48 This is Jocco podcast number 69.
00:00:04.48 --> 00:00:08.64 With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
00:00:08.64 --> 00:00:10.24 Good evening, echo.
00:00:10.24 --> 00:00:10.84 Good evening.
00:00:14.68 --> 00:00:17.92 The president of the United States takes pride
00:00:17.92 --> 00:00:19.76 in presenting the Medal of Honor,
00:00:19.76 --> 00:00:24.76 posthumously, to Captain Henry T. L. Rodd,
00:00:24.76 --> 00:00:27.48 United States Marine Corps.
00:00:27.48 --> 00:00:32.48 For service as set forth in the following citation.
00:00:32.48 --> 00:00:37.48 For conspicuous gallantry and intrapetity
00:00:37.48 --> 00:00:41.28 at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty
00:00:41.28 --> 00:00:45.56 while attached to Marine of fighting squadron 211
00:00:45.56 --> 00:00:49.60 during action against the Japanese land, surface,
00:00:49.60 --> 00:00:52.64 and early units at Wake Island.
00:00:52.64 --> 00:00:58.24 From 8 to 23 December 1941.
00:00:58.24 --> 00:01:02.52 Engaging vastly superior forces of enemy bombers
00:01:02.52 --> 00:01:05.52 and warships on 9 and 12 December,
00:01:05.52 --> 00:01:11.56 Captain L. Rodd shot down two of a flight of 22 hostile planes
00:01:11.56 --> 00:01:15.52 and executing repeated bombing and strafing runs
00:01:15.52 --> 00:01:18.32 at extremely low altitude and close range,
00:01:18.32 --> 00:01:20.96 succeeded in flicking deadly damage
00:01:20.96 --> 00:01:23.12 upon a large Japanese vessel
00:01:23.12 --> 00:01:25.60 thereby sinking the first major warship
00:01:25.60 --> 00:01:28.76 to be destroyed by small caliber bombs delivered
00:01:28.76 --> 00:01:30.92 from a fighter type aircraft.
00:01:32.44 --> 00:01:35.20 When his plane was disabled by hostile fire
00:01:35.20 --> 00:01:37.28 and no other ships were operative,
00:01:37.28 --> 00:01:41.84 Captain L. Rodd assumed command of one flank of the line,
00:01:41.84 --> 00:01:44.68 set up in defiance of the enemy landing
00:01:44.68 --> 00:01:47.16 and conducting a brilliant defense,
00:01:47.16 --> 00:01:49.52 enabled his men to hold their positions
00:01:49.52 --> 00:01:53.32 and repulse determined enemy attacks repeatedly,
00:01:53.32 --> 00:01:57.56 proceeding through intense hostile fuselage
00:01:57.56 --> 00:02:03.36 to provide covering fire for unarmed ammunition carriers.
00:02:04.80 --> 00:02:09.20 Capturing an automatic weapon during one enemy rushing force,
00:02:09.20 --> 00:02:11.24 he gave his own firearm to one of his men
00:02:11.24 --> 00:02:14.40 and fought on vigorously against the Japanese.
00:02:14.40 --> 00:02:19.40 Responsible in a large measure of the strength of his sectors,
00:02:20.40 --> 00:02:22.44 gallons resistance.
00:02:22.44 --> 00:02:26.24 On 23 December, Captain L. Rodd led his men
00:02:26.24 --> 00:02:31.24 with bold, aggressiveness until he fell, mortally wounded.
00:02:33.24 --> 00:02:37.92 His superb skill as a pilot, daring leadership,
00:02:37.92 --> 00:02:40.32 an unswerving devotion to duty
00:02:40.32 --> 00:02:44.12 to distinguish him among the defenders of Wakeland.
00:02:45.12 --> 00:02:48.36 And his valiant conduct reflects the highest credit
00:02:48.36 --> 00:02:53.36 upon himself and the United States Naval Service.
00:02:54.84 --> 00:02:58.24 He gallantly gave his life for his country.
00:03:01.04 --> 00:03:03.40 signed Harry S. Truman.
00:03:03.40 --> 00:03:08.40 And that is the Medal of Honor citation
00:03:11.32 --> 00:03:15.04 for Henry Talmage, L. Rodd, the first aviator
00:03:15.04 --> 00:03:17.76 in World War II to be awarded the Medal of Honor.
00:03:19.04 --> 00:03:21.96 In the first man to sink a warship from a fighter plane
00:03:24.28 --> 00:03:25.96 during the Battle of Wakeland.
00:03:25.96 --> 00:03:28.40 And if you don't know anything about the Battle of Wakeland,
00:03:28.40 --> 00:03:33.40 it began simultaneously with the attack on Pearl Harbor
00:03:33.56 --> 00:03:34.80 when that started.
00:03:34.80 --> 00:03:38.80 And it ended on 23 December 1941
00:03:39.92 --> 00:03:42.80 when American forces were forced to surrender.
00:03:45.20 --> 00:03:49.60 And that was, with around 500 American servicemen,
00:03:50.68 --> 00:03:54.72 and they had a handful of coastal artillery pieces
00:03:54.72 --> 00:03:57.56 and a handful of anti-aircraft guns,
00:03:57.56 --> 00:03:59.32 and they had 12 aircraft.
00:04:00.24 --> 00:04:05.000 And what they were facing was 2,500 Japanese infantry
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.36 supported by three light cruisers, eight destroyers,
00:04:09.36 --> 00:04:12.28 two patrol boats, two troop transports,
00:04:12.28 --> 00:04:14.88 two aircraft carriers with all their planes
00:04:14.88 --> 00:04:16.48 and two heavy cruisers.
00:04:18.56 --> 00:04:20.52 They were completely outnumbered
00:04:20.52 --> 00:04:23.24 and completely and utterly outgunned.
00:04:23.24 --> 00:04:27.16 But they held out for 15 days
00:04:27.16 --> 00:04:30.36 and while they were under that siege,
00:04:30.36 --> 00:04:33.52 on the 20th of December,
00:04:33.52 --> 00:04:37.72 while the Japanese were preparing for their final attack,
00:04:37.72 --> 00:04:44.72 major L-Rodd got out one last letter to his wife.
00:04:44.72 --> 00:04:49.72 And I'm gonna read that to you.
00:04:53.52 --> 00:04:56.84 Saturday, 20 December 1941,
00:04:56.84 --> 00:04:59.28 my dearest darling sweetheart.
00:05:01.68 --> 00:05:03.68 I never suspected this afternoon
00:05:03.68 --> 00:05:06.04 when I wrote my other short note
00:05:06.04 --> 00:05:08.36 that I would be sitting down writing another tonight.
00:05:09.44 --> 00:05:10.36 But here we are.
00:05:11.32 --> 00:05:13.24 I just got in a few minutes ago
00:05:13.24 --> 00:05:16.48 and have just learned that Walt Baylor is returning
00:05:16.48 --> 00:05:20.000 and he has kindly consented to deliver to this personally.
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.48 So I am very thankful for the moment.
00:05:24.12 --> 00:05:26.28 Of course, there isn't a lot of news
00:05:26.28 --> 00:05:27.44 that I can write about it.
00:05:28.44 --> 00:05:32.52 And you probably know more real news than I do anyhow.
00:05:34.16 --> 00:05:35.56 I am missing you terribly
00:05:35.56 --> 00:05:39.44 and I am undergoing a few new experiences
00:05:39.44 --> 00:05:42.72 but also is everyone else.
00:05:44.16 --> 00:05:46.000 We've had considerable rain today
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.48 and you're still cloudy.
00:05:48.64 --> 00:05:51.28 The wind has been very low, however.
00:05:52.64 --> 00:05:55.76 The weather on the whole is nothing to complain about.
00:05:57.20 --> 00:05:59.04 But I would like to see a good old fashioned,
00:05:59.04 --> 00:06:02.24 ties, food, sweep this entire area.
00:06:04.36 --> 00:06:06.44 I imagine there is an awful lot of white washing
00:06:06.44 --> 00:06:08.48 going on now in high places.
00:06:08.48 --> 00:06:10.88 It certainly will be a criminal shame
00:06:10.88 --> 00:06:14.08 if they succeed in covering over everything.
00:06:17.12 --> 00:06:19.80 I am writing this in something of a hurry
00:06:19.80 --> 00:06:22.84 and under somewhat difficult circumstances.
00:06:24.76 --> 00:06:26.08 I'll think of a million things
00:06:26.08 --> 00:06:29.32 that I should have said after I had gone to bed tonight.
00:06:31.68 --> 00:06:34.92 But now I'm going to say that I love you
00:06:34.92 --> 00:06:37.52 and you alone always and always
00:06:37.52 --> 00:06:40.000 and repeated a million times or so.
00:06:42.48 --> 00:06:44.48 Give my love to Mary also
00:06:45.84 --> 00:06:49.48 between the two of you, you have it all.
00:06:51.20 --> 00:06:53.04 There isn't any for anyone else.
00:06:56.72 --> 00:06:58.92 I know that you are praying for me
00:06:58.92 --> 00:07:01.16 and I have nothing more to ask
00:07:01.16 --> 00:07:02.92 than that your prayers be answered.
00:07:02.92 --> 00:07:07.92 You're as devotedly and loving,
00:07:10.44 --> 00:07:11.28 tell much.
00:07:24.68 --> 00:07:28.08 And so I think it's important that
00:07:29.60 --> 00:07:31.12 when you hear that letter,
00:07:31.12 --> 00:07:36.12 you recognize the fact that this is a man.
00:07:38.20 --> 00:07:40.96 And of course, we always remember
00:07:40.96 --> 00:07:45.96 that these men, we call them heroes,
00:07:49.80 --> 00:07:51.28 deserve it be so.
00:07:51.28 --> 00:07:53.68 We do that to honor them.
00:07:53.68 --> 00:07:57.68 But I think it's important to always remember
00:07:57.68 --> 00:08:00.64 that these heroes,
00:08:02.64 --> 00:08:06.84 their people, their people.
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000 And these men, these heroes, these Marines, these people
00:08:18.28 --> 00:08:19.72 that held the line.
00:08:21.52 --> 00:08:23.16 They held the line for 15 days
00:08:23.16 --> 00:08:25.000 before they were forced to surrender
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.76 after losing 49 Marines killed,
00:08:28.76 --> 00:08:32.76 two missing in action, three Navy personnel killed,
00:08:32.76 --> 00:08:34.92 70 US civilians killed.
00:08:34.92 --> 00:08:37.96 And by the way, the Japanese losses were recorded
00:08:37.96 --> 00:08:41.52 about 820 killed with over 300 wounded.
00:08:42.72 --> 00:08:44.96 Two destroyers lost
00:08:44.96 --> 00:08:51.96 and almost 30 Japanese aircraft shot down her damaged.
00:08:55.84 --> 00:09:00.84 But the odds and the ratio of force
00:09:03.92 --> 00:09:08.92 was just stacked against the US forces on Wake Island
00:09:08.92 --> 00:09:10.56 and when you get into a situation like that,
00:09:10.56 --> 00:09:14.56 a dire situation, violent situation,
00:09:14.56 --> 00:09:18.08 a situation where you are facing a determined enemy.
00:09:21.76 --> 00:09:26.76 There is a bond that forms between people.
00:09:28.88 --> 00:09:30.88 Regardless of where they're from
00:09:30.88 --> 00:09:32.52 or what their background is
00:09:32.52 --> 00:09:36.88 or what their socioeconomic class is
00:09:36.88 --> 00:09:38.24 or what service they were in,
00:09:38.24 --> 00:09:39.56 none of that matters.
00:09:39.56 --> 00:09:44.56 There's a bond that forms that cannot be broken.
00:09:52.52 --> 00:09:57.68 And we certainly had that in the Battle of Ramadi.
00:09:57.68 --> 00:10:03.68 The US Army soldiers, United States Marines,
00:10:03.68 --> 00:10:09.08 C.B.S.R. Seals of Task Unit,
00:10:09.08 --> 00:10:14.08 Bruser, all of us that were in that fight,
00:10:15.28 --> 00:10:16.84 had that bond.
00:10:22.44 --> 00:10:23.52 We were brothers.
00:10:27.56 --> 00:10:32.56 And tonight, I am honored to have one of those brothers
00:10:35.68 --> 00:10:36.96 here with me.
00:10:36.96 --> 00:10:41.96 And he's a Marine Corps Aviator, fighter pilot
00:10:44.68 --> 00:10:49.52 who also did time as a forward air controller on the ground.
00:10:49.52 --> 00:10:52.20 And we've talked about that in many of the books
00:10:52.20 --> 00:10:53.68 that we've reviewed on the podcast
00:10:53.68 --> 00:10:56.24 where you have a Marine Corps pilot
00:10:56.24 --> 00:10:59.32 who's now on the ground with the troops.
00:11:00.64 --> 00:11:02.52 Usually in one of the most forward positions
00:11:02.52 --> 00:11:07.52 because they have to know where the troops are, out of that
00:11:08.80 --> 00:11:13.80 air conditioned cockpit and into the sweat and mud
00:11:14.12 --> 00:11:19.12 on the ground and this pilot as an Anglico team leader
00:11:20.56 --> 00:11:23.60 who with his team conducted dozens and dozens
00:11:23.60 --> 00:11:26.000 of missions with Tasmania Bruser in Ramadi
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.44 and I've talked about bringing them on the show.
00:11:28.44 --> 00:11:33.44 And so here he is tonight, Lieutenant Colonel,
00:11:34.12 --> 00:11:39.28 almost retired, David Burke.
00:11:39.28 --> 00:11:44.28 Dave, welcome to the podcast and thank you for coming on.
00:11:46.60 --> 00:11:47.56 Thanks for having me, man.
00:11:47.56 --> 00:11:48.40 It's good to be here.
00:11:50.68 --> 00:11:55.68 So we have to, before we talk about what we went through
00:11:55.92 --> 00:11:58.000 together, we have to learn a little bit about you
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.52 where you came from, what you did
00:12:00.52 --> 00:12:03.68 and how you went from being,
00:12:04.60 --> 00:12:08.40 from being a pilot, but not just a pilot,
00:12:08.40 --> 00:12:10.48 a top gun pilot, but not just a top gun pilot,
00:12:10.48 --> 00:12:13.12 but a top gun instructor
00:12:14.72 --> 00:12:18.20 which is just incredibly selective.
00:12:18.20 --> 00:12:20.76 That's gonna be one of the most selective things
00:12:20.76 --> 00:12:22.76 in the whole world.
00:12:22.76 --> 00:12:23.60 Right?
00:12:23.60 --> 00:12:25.44 How many top gun pilots are there?
00:12:25.44 --> 00:12:27.92 So you've got 25 at a time every three years that kind of rotate
00:12:27.92 --> 00:12:29.48 through a small group.
00:12:29.48 --> 00:12:32.76 Yeah, so that's ridiculous.
00:12:32.76 --> 00:12:36.32 And, but then you thought maybe I you need to get after
00:12:36.32 --> 00:12:37.80 a little bit more, so you're gonna go do an A,
00:12:37.80 --> 00:12:40.56 because so we'll get into that, but let's start off with
00:12:40.56 --> 00:12:44.96 where you came from, just a little bit about your background
00:12:44.96 --> 00:12:47.08 and how you ended up saying, you know what I think I wanna do?
00:12:47.08 --> 00:12:49.80 Being the Marine Corps, go.
00:12:49.80 --> 00:12:51.12 Right on.
00:12:51.12 --> 00:12:52.40 So I actually grew up around here.
00:12:52.40 --> 00:12:53.64 My parents moved out here,
00:12:53.64 --> 00:12:55.76 San Diego and I was probably a year and a half years old.
00:12:55.76 --> 00:12:57.32 I wanted half years old.
00:12:57.32 --> 00:12:59.20 In between, here in Orange County, I grew up
00:12:59.20 --> 00:13:00.36 in Silicon Valley, California, kid.
00:13:02.36 --> 00:13:04.16 Not all that exciting with childhood.
00:13:04.16 --> 00:13:06.60 I don't have, you know, a ton of crazy memories.
00:13:06.60 --> 00:13:08.56 I was pretty quiet kid as a good kid in school.
00:13:08.56 --> 00:13:10.16 Got a long with most folks.
00:13:11.96 --> 00:13:13.56 Moved up Orange County, my parents got divorced.
00:13:13.56 --> 00:13:16.08 It was basically just me and my mom and my sister for a while.
00:13:16.08 --> 00:13:19.12 And I lived in a town called El Toro
00:13:19.12 --> 00:13:21.92 and what happened to be very close to where I grew up
00:13:21.92 --> 00:13:24.32 was a Marine Base, it was a fighter base.
00:13:24.32 --> 00:13:27.68 And so as a kid, I posed there in late 70s
00:13:27.68 --> 00:13:32.68 and early 80s they had F4 fanomes and A4s and A6s
00:13:32.68 --> 00:13:34.56 and just the cool jets at the time.
00:13:34.56 --> 00:13:37.56 And so I went to the air show every year,
00:13:37.56 --> 00:13:39.68 grew up out there and I think it was no joke.
00:13:39.68 --> 00:13:41.52 It was overhead, I could see it every day.
00:13:41.52 --> 00:13:43.88 And I think that just got my blood a little bit.
00:13:45.64 --> 00:13:47.68 Went to El Toro high school, went to the air show,
00:13:47.68 --> 00:13:50.28 probably every year from my six years old till the time
00:13:50.28 --> 00:13:51.68 the base closed down, no joke.
00:13:51.68 --> 00:13:53.64 I mean it was just part of my life.
00:13:53.64 --> 00:13:55.64 And I met some people along the way too.
00:13:55.64 --> 00:13:56.56 There was a lot of Marines living there.
00:13:56.56 --> 00:13:58.20 So I had some real powerful influences
00:13:58.20 --> 00:13:59.76 that kind of got him towards that.
00:14:01.08 --> 00:14:02.32 I'm sure we're gonna get into this
00:14:02.32 --> 00:14:04.36 because it's come up already in the pre-conversation.
00:14:04.36 --> 00:14:06.28 Put it around 14, let's say.
00:14:06.28 --> 00:14:09.92 Watch this obscure movie called Top Gun.
00:14:09.92 --> 00:14:11.40 Straight up, top Gun.
00:14:11.40 --> 00:14:12.96 Straight up man.
00:14:12.96 --> 00:14:14.56 Watch the movie is a kid.
00:14:14.56 --> 00:14:18.04 Saw dudes flying airplanes, off carriers,
00:14:18.04 --> 00:14:19.96 shooting down mags and I'm like,
00:14:19.96 --> 00:14:21.12 I wanna do that.
00:14:21.12 --> 00:14:25.32 And probably by 14, I had a pretty good idea
00:14:25.32 --> 00:14:26.48 that's what I wanted to do.
00:14:27.64 --> 00:14:30.60 Did you make the connection between school and grades
00:14:30.60 --> 00:14:31.44 and all that stuff?
00:14:31.44 --> 00:14:33.000 Because a lot of people saw that movie and said,
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.28 I wanna be a top Gun pilot,
00:14:34.28 --> 00:14:36.52 but I'm still gonna slack off and do whatever I want
00:14:36.52 --> 00:14:38.72 and not play hooky and all that.
00:14:38.72 --> 00:14:40.16 Somehow you made that connection.
00:14:40.16 --> 00:14:41.56 It's not shown in the movie, right?
00:14:41.56 --> 00:14:44.000 They didn't show people studying hard in school
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.60 because that would have not sold a lot of tickets.
00:14:46.60 --> 00:14:47.44 Oh no.
00:14:47.44 --> 00:14:49.84 I did eventually.
00:14:49.84 --> 00:14:51.24 I mean, when I watched that movie,
00:14:51.24 --> 00:14:52.44 I think there was just something,
00:14:52.44 --> 00:14:53.72 I'd always been interested in aviation.
00:14:53.72 --> 00:14:55.80 It's kind of captivating when you see planes flying around
00:14:55.80 --> 00:14:57.20 and to get to see the air shows, see the blue angels,
00:14:57.20 --> 00:14:57.68 I kind of said,
00:14:57.68 --> 00:14:59.12 if you can't help it look up and watch that stuff,
00:14:59.12 --> 00:14:59.96 it's cool.
00:15:01.92 --> 00:15:05.16 I would say that my performance in the academic arena
00:15:05.16 --> 00:15:07.24 was slightly less than stellar.
00:15:07.24 --> 00:15:11.52 I did find, but I had no real motivation to do anything.
00:15:11.52 --> 00:15:15.36 I wasn't a little driven kid to work really hard.
00:15:15.36 --> 00:15:17.20 I kind of discovered that if I put in very,
00:15:17.20 --> 00:15:18.68 little effort, I was okay.
00:15:18.68 --> 00:15:19.80 And if I wanted to do really well,
00:15:19.80 --> 00:15:20.76 I had to put in a lot of effort
00:15:20.76 --> 00:15:22.12 and I had made a much of a connection.
00:15:22.12 --> 00:15:25.12 But as I got a little older,
00:15:25.12 --> 00:15:25.92 you know, watch the movie,
00:15:25.92 --> 00:15:27.56 I think that was a part of a lot of different things.
00:15:27.56 --> 00:15:29.000 But about the time I was 16,
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.20 it kind of junior year in high school.
00:15:32.28 --> 00:15:34.000 As I got some other influences in my life,
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.56 I found big as one was a guy named Aaron Irvin.
00:15:35.56 --> 00:15:37.12 I started working at Target around the corner
00:15:37.12 --> 00:15:38.72 from my house and he was a Marine there.
00:15:38.72 --> 00:15:41.20 And like I said, my parents got divorced.
00:15:41.20 --> 00:15:43.40 I had a step dad that was there
00:15:43.40 --> 00:15:44.32 and kind of coming going,
00:15:44.32 --> 00:15:46.20 he ended up being a really big father figure in my life.
00:15:46.20 --> 00:15:48.72 And a real positive influence and a Marine,
00:15:48.72 --> 00:15:49.40 which was great.
00:15:49.40 --> 00:15:52.08 And he explains some more things about what it's like
00:15:52.08 --> 00:15:52.92 to be in Marine.
00:15:52.92 --> 00:15:54.56 He's the one that made the connection for me
00:15:54.56 --> 00:15:56.24 that all that stuff you saw in the movie
00:15:56.24 --> 00:15:57.44 is you can actually do that for real.
00:15:57.44 --> 00:15:59.24 The Marine Corps, you can do that as a Marine.
00:15:59.24 --> 00:16:00.28 You know, it's not just a movie.
00:16:00.28 --> 00:16:01.12 That's a real life.
00:16:01.12 --> 00:16:03.12 Somebody's living that life right now.
00:16:03.12 --> 00:16:04.52 And you can do that.
00:16:04.52 --> 00:16:06.96 And I remember coming home and kind of telling my mom,
00:16:06.96 --> 00:16:09.28 like, hey, I'm 16, I'm a junior high school.
00:16:09.28 --> 00:16:11.96 I'm thinking about being a Marine Corps fighter pilot,
00:16:11.96 --> 00:16:13.56 which I had no military in my back
00:16:13.56 --> 00:16:16.16 or nobody had ever done anything like that.
00:16:16.16 --> 00:16:17.80 And her answer was,
00:16:17.80 --> 00:16:18.76 that sounds awesome.
00:16:18.76 --> 00:16:19.80 You should do that.
00:16:19.80 --> 00:16:23.12 I mean, just 100% and she had a very similar approach.
00:16:23.12 --> 00:16:24.20 You know, everything, I have a,
00:16:24.20 --> 00:16:27.84 every idea I ever had in my life that I run by my mom,
00:16:27.84 --> 00:16:29.16 she's like, well, somebody's gonna do it.
00:16:29.16 --> 00:16:29.96 Mine's all be you.
00:16:29.96 --> 00:16:31.08 That was kind of a approach to everything.
00:16:31.08 --> 00:16:32.52 I want to be a fighter pilot in the Marine Corps.
00:16:32.52 --> 00:16:33.20 So I'm just gonna be it.
00:16:33.20 --> 00:16:34.84 Mine's all be you.
00:16:34.84 --> 00:16:36.68 And that's about the time I kind of started
00:16:36.68 --> 00:16:37.96 getting my stuff together.
00:16:37.96 --> 00:16:39.68 I mean, I wasn't a mess by any stretch,
00:16:39.68 --> 00:16:41.32 but I was a little bit just kind of,
00:16:41.32 --> 00:16:43.24 run through my thing, being a kid.
00:16:43.24 --> 00:16:46.52 And I certainly think I was lucky
00:16:46.52 --> 00:16:51.32 because I knew with great detail
00:16:51.32 --> 00:16:54.36 at about 16 and change what I wanted to do.
00:16:54.36 --> 00:16:56.12 I mean, I knew I wanted to be a Marine Corps
00:16:56.12 --> 00:16:58.40 at 18 pilot based in Southern California
00:16:58.40 --> 00:17:00.12 and for life carriers.
00:17:00.12 --> 00:17:01.76 And that's exactly what ended up doing.
00:17:01.76 --> 00:17:04.40 So at that time, everything I started to do
00:17:04.40 --> 00:17:07.04 from there was with that kind of singular focus
00:17:07.04 --> 00:17:09.48 of circling back to do that.
00:17:09.48 --> 00:17:11.04 I even knew I wanted to be stationed at Altorra.
00:17:11.04 --> 00:17:13.96 I mean, I had a real specific plan.
00:17:13.96 --> 00:17:15.76 And so all the things I started doing from there,
00:17:15.76 --> 00:17:18.36 school, you know, into college as well,
00:17:18.36 --> 00:17:19.20 go into the Marine Corps,
00:17:19.20 --> 00:17:21.16 and recruit her to say I wanted to join the Marine Corps,
00:17:21.16 --> 00:17:22.44 be an officer in the Marine Corps.
00:17:22.44 --> 00:17:24.40 All those things were geared very specifically
00:17:24.40 --> 00:17:25.24 towards that goal.
00:17:25.24 --> 00:17:26.52 Now there's a ton of hurdles
00:17:26.52 --> 00:17:27.76 between time you're 16 and time.
00:17:27.76 --> 00:17:29.68 I got my commission at 21.
00:17:29.68 --> 00:17:32.28 But everything else that I did in my life
00:17:32.28 --> 00:17:34.96 was either a distraction that just got rid of,
00:17:34.96 --> 00:17:37.28 or it was a means to that end.
00:17:37.28 --> 00:17:39.16 I worked full time,
00:17:39.16 --> 00:17:42.88 I was in school, put myself through the nearest college,
00:17:42.88 --> 00:17:45.12 the local state school that I lived,
00:17:45.12 --> 00:17:47.32 close to as a drove up to school,
00:17:47.32 --> 00:17:49.000 didn't have like a real big exciting college life.
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.04 Wasn't in the fraternity, didn't go away to school.
00:17:52.04 --> 00:17:54.000 I paid my way through a school.
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.96 I got a good education.
00:17:54.96 --> 00:17:56.80 I worked really hard to do well,
00:17:56.80 --> 00:17:59.28 but it was all specifically designed to,
00:17:59.28 --> 00:18:00.60 you want to be in the Marine Corps and be an officer,
00:18:00.60 --> 00:18:03.000 you need to college graduate, you need to be a college graduate.
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.16 Right on, I can do that.
00:18:04.16 --> 00:18:05.000 I can do that here.
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.84 Where's the closest college?
00:18:05.84 --> 00:18:06.96 Yeah, where's the closest college?
00:18:06.96 --> 00:18:07.80 How much does it cost?
00:18:07.80 --> 00:18:08.64 How much do I need to work?
00:18:08.64 --> 00:18:09.48 Did the math.
00:18:09.48 --> 00:18:11.92 It was my life from about that time.
00:18:11.92 --> 00:18:14.72 I started working, like I said, I worked at Target as a kid.
00:18:14.72 --> 00:18:17.52 I worked at Target from the time I was 15 and a half
00:18:17.52 --> 00:18:20.000 and got to work permit from school to the time
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.12 that I got my commission in the Marine Corps.
00:18:22.12 --> 00:18:24.28 And I went to school and Casay Fullerton,
00:18:24.28 --> 00:18:25.48 Monday, Wednesday, Friday.
00:18:25.48 --> 00:18:27.04 My mom was a guidance counselor in a teacher,
00:18:27.04 --> 00:18:28.56 so she helped me build a schedule
00:18:28.56 --> 00:18:30.72 that I could graduate this fast as possible,
00:18:30.72 --> 00:18:32.40 which is exactly in four years.
00:18:32.40 --> 00:18:33.84 It was all day Monday, all day Wednesday,
00:18:33.84 --> 00:18:35.44 and half a day Friday.
00:18:35.44 --> 00:18:38.52 And I worked Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
00:18:38.52 --> 00:18:41.24 The money I paid, I got paid, I went to my tuition,
00:18:41.24 --> 00:18:43.16 my tuition went to my education, my education,
00:18:43.16 --> 00:18:45.000 got me a commission in the Marine Corps.
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.36 I mean, that was kind of it.
00:18:46.36 --> 00:18:47.52 I mean, in some ways you look back,
00:18:47.52 --> 00:18:49.52 I'm probably could have diversified a little bit.
00:18:49.52 --> 00:18:51.68 But at the time, I wasn't unhappy.
00:18:51.68 --> 00:18:52.92 I was stoked, man.
00:18:52.92 --> 00:18:54.32 I was exactly what I wanted to be doing.
00:18:54.32 --> 00:18:56.32 There was no man I wish I could be doing this.
00:18:56.32 --> 00:18:58.32 It wasn't a chore by any stretch.
00:18:58.32 --> 00:19:00.52 Like I said, in retrospect, I probably could have done things
00:19:00.52 --> 00:19:03.16 a little bit differently, but 17-year-old day-birth,
00:19:03.16 --> 00:19:05.56 18-year-old day-birth, new exactly what
00:19:05.56 --> 00:19:06.000 he wanted to do.
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.56 And I had sort of talked myself into it.
00:19:07.56 --> 00:19:10.16 Like, hey, any detour, that's going to throw you off your path, man.
00:19:10.16 --> 00:19:12.60 And you're going to look back with it regretting go,
00:19:12.60 --> 00:19:14.64 you know why you didn't have been what you wanted to be?
00:19:14.64 --> 00:19:15.68 You just took us at this or that.
00:19:15.68 --> 00:19:16.88 And I wasn't going to let that happen.
00:19:16.88 --> 00:19:20.04 So I kind of just got a little intense about being
00:19:20.04 --> 00:19:21.72 a pound in the Marine Corps and sharing it up.
00:19:21.72 --> 00:19:24.60 And there's still luck involved, because when you go to TBS,
00:19:24.60 --> 00:19:27.88 which is the basic school, which all marine officers go through,
00:19:27.88 --> 00:19:33.92 you have to still win or get that billet that you wanted.
00:19:33.92 --> 00:19:35.52 And you got that.
00:19:35.52 --> 00:19:38.36 But I mean, that could have gone totally mad.
00:19:38.36 --> 00:19:38.96 Sideways.
00:19:38.96 --> 00:19:41.12 There's a lot of luck involved.
00:19:41.12 --> 00:19:43.68 I think everybody in the military, and everybody that's
00:19:43.68 --> 00:19:45.56 been successful in the military knows you're looking back
00:19:45.56 --> 00:19:48.36 in your career, it's a confluence of a lot of different things.
00:19:48.36 --> 00:19:51.000 But timing, circumstance, and luck, or they're a part of it
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.72 without a doubt.
00:19:51.72 --> 00:19:53.52 Nobody can take credit for everything they've done.
00:19:53.52 --> 00:19:56.000 And if I went back to do it again, the odds of it
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.48 work out the way they did are pretty slim.
00:19:57.48 --> 00:20:01.20 There's just a lot of things that worked out on my favor.
00:20:01.20 --> 00:20:02.76 But I went to OCS.
00:20:02.76 --> 00:20:04.16 I went to the Marine Corps recruit,
00:20:04.16 --> 00:20:06.32 started my freshman year at Cal State Fullerton,
00:20:06.32 --> 00:20:09.36 as a 17-1er sort of college, went right to their crew
00:20:09.36 --> 00:20:12.12 around day one, or they called an OCS officer selection officer.
00:20:12.12 --> 00:20:13.52 So it's basically a recruiter for officers.
00:20:13.52 --> 00:20:14.28 I want to be in Marine.
00:20:14.28 --> 00:20:16.84 It's like right on, start filling up the spade work.
00:20:16.84 --> 00:20:18.48 But at the payboard, I said, I want to be a pilot,
00:20:18.48 --> 00:20:20.04 as a piece of cake, no problem.
00:20:20.04 --> 00:20:22.28 We can make that happen.
00:20:22.28 --> 00:20:24.08 Sign this ground contract, and we'll just make it
00:20:24.08 --> 00:20:25.08 part of the standpoint of the future.
00:20:25.08 --> 00:20:29.40 So for those of you that don't know, that's a big lie.
00:20:29.40 --> 00:20:30.96 It ain't that easy.
00:20:30.96 --> 00:20:32.96 So when he says ground contract, of course,
00:20:32.96 --> 00:20:36.08 the Marine Corps needs pilots and guys to infantry.
00:20:36.08 --> 00:20:39.08 And so, but they need more infantry than they need pilots.
00:20:39.08 --> 00:20:40.40 And so they say, hey, don't worry about it.
00:20:40.40 --> 00:20:41.88 You just sign up for ground right now.
00:20:41.88 --> 00:20:43.12 We'll take care of that other pilot.
00:20:43.12 --> 00:20:43.72 You want to be a pie?
00:20:43.72 --> 00:20:45.12 Yeah, of course, we'll take care of that later.
00:20:45.12 --> 00:20:46.12 Yeah, we'll just transition over.
00:20:46.12 --> 00:20:46.76 It should have made a big deal.
00:20:46.76 --> 00:20:47.60 No factor.
00:20:47.60 --> 00:20:50.44 And at 17, I mean, I was signing paperwork
00:20:50.44 --> 00:20:51.36 to be a Marine officer.
00:20:51.36 --> 00:20:53.000 That was a big step for me.
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.04 And I probably would have signed anything.
00:20:55.04 --> 00:20:58.64 Happily signed that after my freshman year in college,
00:20:58.64 --> 00:21:01.04 I went to OCS or Canada School.
00:21:01.04 --> 00:21:04.000 And to be honest with you, and I had all these big-grand ideas
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.72 for the last two, three years, I knew what I wanted to do.
00:21:06.72 --> 00:21:10.32 But when I went to OCS, I was a first real hurdle.
00:21:10.32 --> 00:21:14.16 I mean, everything else was either an idea, a plan, some paperwork.
00:21:14.16 --> 00:21:15.36 I get to the off-circuit of the school.
00:21:15.36 --> 00:21:17.56 And it's like, OK, it was a real Marine drill,
00:21:17.56 --> 00:21:20.28 and Chuck or Scrimm and Atcha, you're really doing the deed there.
00:21:20.28 --> 00:21:23.44 And getting through OCS was a big thing for me,
00:21:23.44 --> 00:21:25.44 because it was a first real test of,
00:21:25.44 --> 00:21:26.92 and I knew what I wanted to do.
00:21:26.92 --> 00:21:29.80 But I had no real sense of I had what was required
00:21:29.80 --> 00:21:30.96 to be a Marine.
00:21:30.96 --> 00:21:34.28 And I think as a kid, you build up what that is in your mind.
00:21:34.28 --> 00:21:36.84 It's a larger than life thing.
00:21:36.84 --> 00:21:38.04 How could anybody possibly do this?
00:21:38.04 --> 00:21:39.44 You turned it into something more than it is.
00:21:39.44 --> 00:21:43.64 When I went to boot camp, there was a Navy seal there.
00:21:43.64 --> 00:21:47.80 And I swear, when I saw him, I was like, God, look,
00:21:47.80 --> 00:21:52.28 I need huge, huge, big giant farms.
00:21:52.28 --> 00:21:55.20 And big, just a big massive guy.
00:21:55.20 --> 00:21:58.40 It just looked like a destroyer of human life.
00:21:58.40 --> 00:21:59.56 Oh my God.
00:21:59.56 --> 00:22:04.12 So fast forward four years on the teams.
00:22:04.12 --> 00:22:05.60 And I meet this guy.
00:22:05.60 --> 00:22:07.32 And he's not at all man.
00:22:07.32 --> 00:22:09.32 He was completely in my head.
00:22:09.32 --> 00:22:10.60 It was completely in my head.
00:22:10.60 --> 00:22:11.88 But this guy was such a destroyer.
00:22:11.88 --> 00:22:14.56 But I just thought, hey, he's a seal.
00:22:14.56 --> 00:22:16.04 He must be a destroyer.
00:22:16.04 --> 00:22:18.56 And I actually saw it that way.
00:22:18.56 --> 00:22:19.04 Yeah.
00:22:19.04 --> 00:22:19.84 You can't help it.
00:22:19.84 --> 00:22:20.76 And it certainly at that age.
00:22:20.76 --> 00:22:23.36 I mean, those things are real powerful influences.
00:22:23.36 --> 00:22:25.08 When you get out to OCS and all of a sudden,
00:22:25.08 --> 00:22:28.12 you're like, oh, man, I need to, I didn't make this happen.
00:22:28.12 --> 00:22:30.24 That was a big achievement in my life.
00:22:30.24 --> 00:22:31.32 I said, hey, I can do this.
00:22:31.32 --> 00:22:35.48 OK, I started to realize I'm not the biggest guy in the Marine Corps.
00:22:35.48 --> 00:22:37.96 Nobody's going to mistake me for a destroyer.
00:22:37.96 --> 00:22:39.92 But what I discovered as I got there,
00:22:39.92 --> 00:22:42.64 I knew mentally what I wanted to do.
00:22:42.64 --> 00:22:44.40 It wasn't a real question mark about my intentions,
00:22:44.40 --> 00:22:45.40 or my desires.
00:22:45.40 --> 00:22:47.68 And I was surrounded by tough, strong kids.
00:22:47.68 --> 00:22:49.88 Young kids, my age that are trying to bring marine officers.
00:22:49.88 --> 00:22:52.80 And that's a physical and a mental challenge.
00:22:52.80 --> 00:22:53.80 So there's no doubt about it.
00:22:53.80 --> 00:22:56.08 And I was seeing guys kind of left and right of me
00:22:56.08 --> 00:23:01.20 that looked at least bigger, faster, stronger, tougher.
00:23:01.20 --> 00:23:03.32 And more capable than they looked like that.
00:23:03.32 --> 00:23:04.48 That same image I had in your mind.
00:23:04.48 --> 00:23:06.60 And I'm watching these things kind of fall out of stuff.
00:23:06.60 --> 00:23:07.88 We're not finished stuff fast enough.
00:23:07.88 --> 00:23:10.32 We're just straight up quit.
00:23:10.32 --> 00:23:13.16 Guys would deal or drop on requests at OCS.
00:23:13.16 --> 00:23:18.68 And I was kind of looking around thinking, what's going on?
00:23:18.68 --> 00:23:21.72 Why are you here if your plan wasn't to get through it?
00:23:21.72 --> 00:23:26.12 So that was a really good thing for me, psychologically,
00:23:26.12 --> 00:23:28.88 to realize that it wasn't just a fantasy or a dream.
00:23:28.88 --> 00:23:31.96 I had the potential to be able to do this.
00:23:31.96 --> 00:23:33.88 So I got through a C.S.
00:23:33.88 --> 00:23:35.12 That's kind of a painful process.
00:23:35.12 --> 00:23:36.36 As you know, it's 84 days.
00:23:36.36 --> 00:23:37.68 It can be slogging.
00:23:37.68 --> 00:23:39.56 You lose a lot of folks doing it for all those
00:23:39.56 --> 00:23:40.36 who are just different reasons.
00:23:40.36 --> 00:23:41.12 Some people get hurt.
00:23:41.12 --> 00:23:41.76 Some people quit.
00:23:41.76 --> 00:23:44.16 Some people just can't do it.
00:23:44.16 --> 00:23:45.52 And when you get on the backside of that,
00:23:45.52 --> 00:23:49.04 like I can make this happen, let's get that air contract.
00:23:49.04 --> 00:23:50.44 Well, we'll get to that air contract.
00:23:50.44 --> 00:23:51.84 At the basics school.
00:23:51.84 --> 00:23:54.64 So when you get your commission, you finish school,
00:23:54.64 --> 00:23:56.56 you get your degree, finish officer,
00:23:56.56 --> 00:23:58.60 candid school, and so basically it's a head you've done everything
00:23:58.60 --> 00:23:59.40 that you need.
00:23:59.40 --> 00:24:01.000 Your commission officer became a second-of-the-end
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.52 in the Marine Corps in June of 1994.
00:24:03.52 --> 00:24:05.48 And the first thing you do is on active duty as a Marine
00:24:05.48 --> 00:24:06.84 is you go to something called the basis school.
00:24:06.84 --> 00:24:08.84 And you've talked about it a few times.
00:24:08.84 --> 00:24:10.36 It's basically a school for the Marine Corps
00:24:10.36 --> 00:24:12.76 teaches officers a little bit of everything.
00:24:12.76 --> 00:24:14.84 Doesn't teach you everything of anything,
00:24:14.84 --> 00:24:16.76 but you get a little exposure to infantry,
00:24:16.76 --> 00:24:19.20 you expose your tanks, artillery, call for fire,
00:24:19.20 --> 00:24:22.16 you get a little exposure aviation, patrol, and defense off.
00:24:22.16 --> 00:24:24.08 And so you kind of get a whole way in the land
00:24:24.08 --> 00:24:26.44 and the whole point of that for the Marine Corps,
00:24:26.44 --> 00:24:28.20 you go there with 250 people.
00:24:28.20 --> 00:24:30.68 And they got to give you one of those people in assignment.
00:24:30.68 --> 00:24:34.44 A particular job and MLS, a specialty.
00:24:34.44 --> 00:24:35.52 And they rank you.
00:24:35.52 --> 00:24:39.12 I mean, you are ranked from one to 250.
00:24:39.12 --> 00:24:41.32 And for aviation when I got there,
00:24:41.32 --> 00:24:42.88 I remember getting in the first week.
00:24:42.88 --> 00:24:44.20 They kind of announced what billets
00:24:44.20 --> 00:24:45.44 are going to be available.
00:24:45.44 --> 00:24:48.44 I were going to have 40 infantry slots and 20.
00:24:48.44 --> 00:24:50.84 They just tell you kind of what we expect to have
00:24:50.84 --> 00:24:51.44 breakdown.
00:24:51.44 --> 00:24:52.84 And from there, you're supposed to go back and think
00:24:52.84 --> 00:24:54.92 about what you want to do.
00:24:54.92 --> 00:24:57.28 They had two pilot slots.
00:24:57.28 --> 00:24:59.52 And like, man, that is some rough math,
00:24:59.52 --> 00:25:00.48 250 folks.
00:25:00.48 --> 00:25:02.52 Now, not all 250 wanted to be a pilot.
00:25:02.52 --> 00:25:06.48 Obviously, not all 250 people were qualified with their eyes
00:25:06.48 --> 00:25:07.24 and whatnot.
00:25:07.24 --> 00:25:10.20 So it wasn't competing with 250 people.
00:25:10.20 --> 00:25:12.32 But there's a lot of people that wanted to be a pilot.
00:25:12.32 --> 00:25:14.04 So the math was certainly not in my favor.
00:25:14.04 --> 00:25:17.60 And that was another challenge of, yeah, you got to do well.
00:25:17.60 --> 00:25:19.96 I mean, you get ranked and graded on everything.
00:25:19.96 --> 00:25:22.56 Physical fitness, your leadership ability, your academics.
00:25:22.56 --> 00:25:25.16 You get peer reviewed, your peers rate you,
00:25:25.16 --> 00:25:26.84 and you know, anonymously, and what they think of you.
00:25:26.84 --> 00:25:29.88 So you got basically six months to get after it.
00:25:29.88 --> 00:25:32.92 And at the end, they line you up, 250 people,
00:25:32.92 --> 00:25:35.28 in a line, this is a real line.
00:25:35.28 --> 00:25:37.08 And you walk into a room and on the room,
00:25:37.08 --> 00:25:38.32 there's a board.
00:25:38.32 --> 00:25:41.52 And whatever job is available, you can pick.
00:25:41.52 --> 00:25:45.36 Now, the Marine Corps does the same called quality spread
00:25:45.36 --> 00:25:47.40 where they basically cut the class in third,
00:25:47.40 --> 00:25:51.24 so at a 250 folks, 80, 80, 80, or something around there,
00:25:51.24 --> 00:25:53.80 the number one guy picks, and then number 81 guy picks,
00:25:53.80 --> 00:25:56.96 and then the number 161 guy picks, whatever it is.
00:25:56.96 --> 00:25:59.04 And then the number two guy picks.
00:25:59.04 --> 00:26:00.88 The only job in the Marine Corps that they did not
00:26:00.88 --> 00:26:03.84 quality spread was that the basics school was pilot.
00:26:03.84 --> 00:26:07.28 So it was going to be the first two guys out of the gate
00:26:07.28 --> 00:26:09.12 that wanted it, that we're qualified, we're going to get it.
00:26:09.12 --> 00:26:12.24 And I got the number two spot.
00:26:12.24 --> 00:26:16.28 So again, it was one of those things that I was starting
00:26:16.28 --> 00:26:20.28 to in my mind realize, well, this I can do this.
00:26:20.28 --> 00:26:22.08 I built this thing up when I wanted to do.
00:26:22.08 --> 00:26:24.48 I'm 21 now, 22, I think actually.
00:26:24.48 --> 00:26:27.52 So it's six years of my life that I've been sort of
00:26:27.52 --> 00:26:28.72 singularly dedicated to.
00:26:28.72 --> 00:26:31.56 And it's so that day where my platoon commander,
00:26:31.56 --> 00:26:32.96 guy named John Marion, I'll never forget it.
00:26:32.96 --> 00:26:34.76 He was an F-18 pilot.
00:26:34.76 --> 00:26:35.92 Bring to me, it was office.
00:26:35.92 --> 00:26:38.52 It's like Dave, you're going to be a pilot.
00:26:38.52 --> 00:26:40.84 And I think you're going to fly America's airplane.
00:26:40.84 --> 00:26:43.04 You're going to fly the F-18 Hornet.
00:26:43.04 --> 00:26:44.32 It was an awesome day, man.
00:26:44.32 --> 00:26:47.08 And I want, I want to ever forget it.
00:26:47.08 --> 00:26:49.36 And that was it.
00:26:49.36 --> 00:26:51.000 I got my ticket.
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000 When I was selected for a pilot, I was ranked, I think,
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.88 like number eight and a 250 in my company.
00:26:57.88 --> 00:27:00.000 And by the time I graduated like three weeks later,
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.08 I was like 25 and a 250.
00:27:02.08 --> 00:27:06.04 So my performance might have declined a little bit after I had achieved
00:27:06.04 --> 00:27:07.04 that.
00:27:07.04 --> 00:27:08.20 So in the theory of no slack.
00:27:08.20 --> 00:27:10.64 Yeah, there was a little slack in that line.
00:27:10.64 --> 00:27:12.72 The line was pretty tight for a lot of years.
00:27:12.72 --> 00:27:13.36 For six years.
00:27:13.36 --> 00:27:14.36 Yeah.
00:27:14.36 --> 00:27:14.56 Got it.
00:27:14.56 --> 00:27:16.16 So a little bit of slack there at the end.
00:27:16.16 --> 00:27:20.48 But I did finish well enough to get that pilot.
00:27:20.48 --> 00:27:21.40 Which is what I always wanted.
00:27:21.40 --> 00:27:22.20 It was kind of my dream.
00:27:22.20 --> 00:27:23.64 What year was that?
00:27:23.64 --> 00:27:25.80 That was April of 1995.
00:27:25.80 --> 00:27:28.000 So I started the basic school in October of 1994.
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.44 Right after I got a graduate in college in June,
00:27:30.44 --> 00:27:33.36 little delay to get down to Quantico for the basic school.
00:27:33.36 --> 00:27:34.08 That's six months long.
00:27:34.08 --> 00:27:35.68 I graduated sometime in mid-April.
00:27:35.68 --> 00:27:38.40 Well, well, about this time in 1995.
00:27:38.40 --> 00:27:40.08 So.
00:27:40.08 --> 00:27:41.92 And then you had a flight school.
00:27:41.92 --> 00:27:42.44 Yeah.
00:27:42.44 --> 00:27:43.08 You'd do the rag.
00:27:43.08 --> 00:27:45.24 You'd do all that stuff to get out to a squad.
00:27:45.24 --> 00:27:47.76 And then the first kind of work you were doing was
00:27:47.76 --> 00:27:49.16 Southern Watch, right?
00:27:49.16 --> 00:27:49.52 Yeah.
00:27:49.52 --> 00:27:51.60 So I get through a flight school and pick an F-A-Teen.
00:27:51.60 --> 00:27:53.08 I get stationed at El Toro.
00:27:53.08 --> 00:27:55.24 So I am literally living the dream.
00:27:55.24 --> 00:27:56.48 I'm back to my hometown.
00:27:59.16 --> 00:28:02.12 I think I went to like my tenure high school reunion.
00:28:02.12 --> 00:28:03.64 And I had told all my buddies, you know,
00:28:03.64 --> 00:28:06.68 I wanted to do a run into some people I hadn't seen
00:28:06.68 --> 00:28:07.32 in the whiles.
00:28:07.32 --> 00:28:08.60 It was good.
00:28:08.60 --> 00:28:12.24 And shortly after I got there, I actually flew the last flight
00:28:12.24 --> 00:28:12.76 at El Toro.
00:28:12.76 --> 00:28:14.20 They closed the base and all the Marines moved down
00:28:14.20 --> 00:28:14.76 to Miramar.
00:28:14.76 --> 00:28:17.56 So the Navy, where Topkin was filmed and all that stuff
00:28:17.56 --> 00:28:20.20 back in the day, the Navy left San Diego.
00:28:20.20 --> 00:28:22.36 Move back east and the Marine Corps happily took over
00:28:22.36 --> 00:28:22.88 that base.
00:28:22.88 --> 00:28:26.24 And so I moved down to Miramar and it up in an F-A-Teen squadron.
00:28:26.24 --> 00:28:29.08 Station to Miramar, flying, Hornets off carriers.
00:28:29.08 --> 00:28:31.08 Straight up, living in June.
00:28:31.08 --> 00:28:33.92 I mean, actual dream you are now living in this time.
00:28:33.92 --> 00:28:36.28 That's exactly right.
00:28:36.28 --> 00:28:38.56 I'm living in San Diego.
00:28:38.56 --> 00:28:41.68 I was living in PB off and in Kappa.
00:28:41.68 --> 00:28:44.92 And Station to Miramar, flying Hornets.
00:28:44.92 --> 00:28:47.28 And the carrier that I was assigned to,
00:28:47.28 --> 00:28:49.76 my first deployment, we did Operation Southern Watch.
00:28:49.76 --> 00:28:53.16 So, you know, I watched Desert Storm in 91 on TV.
00:28:53.16 --> 00:28:55.08 I was in freshman in college.
00:28:55.08 --> 00:28:58.20 And we hadn't done much in the military since then,
00:28:58.20 --> 00:29:00.24 but we had flown every single day
00:29:00.24 --> 00:29:01.52 since that war ended.
00:29:01.52 --> 00:29:04.000 And I think it was March of 91.
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.04 Every single day since then, we flew patrols over Iraq
00:29:07.04 --> 00:29:09.44 to make sure that the skies were clear.
00:29:09.44 --> 00:29:11.80 And we were enforcing the no-fly zone.
00:29:11.80 --> 00:29:15.88 And here it was, you know, 10 years later, 2000 on a carrier
00:29:15.88 --> 00:29:20.88 in the Persian Gulf, flying combat operations over Southern Iraq.
00:29:21.76 --> 00:29:23.20 Did you guys ever drop me bombs, huh?
00:29:23.20 --> 00:29:24.04 I did.
00:29:24.04 --> 00:29:24.88 Yeah, a few of us did.
00:29:24.88 --> 00:29:25.88 Not a ton.
00:29:25.88 --> 00:29:26.72 There wasn't a ton going on, but what we would do,
00:29:26.72 --> 00:29:27.92 these things called response options.
00:29:27.92 --> 00:29:29.84 So if that Iraq is we'd do something, I think, in my case,
00:29:29.84 --> 00:29:32.76 they set up a surface air missile, south of a line
00:29:32.76 --> 00:29:33.72 that they weren't supposed to be.
00:29:33.72 --> 00:29:35.96 And we had surveillance at told us what was out there.
00:29:35.96 --> 00:29:39.40 And I launched an omission on Blupper, a SAMHSAite,
00:29:39.40 --> 00:29:40.88 with something called a J-Dam at the time.
00:29:40.88 --> 00:29:44.88 It was a bomb guided by GPS, which at the time was this brand new
00:29:44.88 --> 00:29:45.40 operation.
00:29:45.40 --> 00:29:46.60 Yeah, it was crazy technology.
00:29:46.60 --> 00:29:48.36 I think we were on the only planes in the entire carrier
00:29:48.36 --> 00:29:50.64 that could do it, because we had this thing called a GPS,
00:29:50.64 --> 00:29:51.88 super fancy back then.
00:29:53.08 --> 00:29:55.44 But at the time, J-Dam, that was combat.
00:29:55.44 --> 00:29:58.20 That was, there was no other show in town.
00:29:58.20 --> 00:30:03.20 And so then I dropped a bomb on a SAMHSAite in Iraq,
00:30:03.20 --> 00:30:06.24 off a carrier in an F-18.
00:30:06.24 --> 00:30:08.80 You could have just retired there.
00:30:08.80 --> 00:30:09.80 We're done here to go.
00:30:09.80 --> 00:30:11.96 I could have come back to that.
00:30:11.96 --> 00:30:13.08 It could have flown me off the ship.
00:30:13.08 --> 00:30:15.56 And I probably would have died a happy man at that point.
00:30:15.56 --> 00:30:16.56 That's it.
00:30:16.56 --> 00:30:17.84 I have reached critical mass.
00:30:17.84 --> 00:30:18.92 That's all I ever wanted to do.
00:30:18.92 --> 00:30:23.56 So it was, again, a lot of it was just things
00:30:23.56 --> 00:30:26.04 worked out of my favor, but I did exactly what I wanted to do
00:30:26.04 --> 00:30:28.96 when that event was kind of at the time, sort of the pinnacle.
00:30:28.96 --> 00:30:30.44 That was what I thought I was going to achieve.
00:30:30.44 --> 00:30:31.76 Yeah, I mean, it's the same thing in the dry years
00:30:31.76 --> 00:30:32.44 for the seal teams.
00:30:32.44 --> 00:30:37.20 Like if you did some kind of mission, you were just super stoked.
00:30:37.20 --> 00:30:39.48 We were over in the Persian Gulf.
00:30:39.48 --> 00:30:43.40 Actually, at the same time, 1999, 2000, I was there.
00:30:43.40 --> 00:30:47.44 I was in the Persian Gulf when we were doing, you know, meal operations, stop
00:30:47.44 --> 00:30:48.68 and smugglers coming out of Iraq.
00:30:48.68 --> 00:30:51.72 So we were taking down vessels and getting control of them.
00:30:51.72 --> 00:30:55.000 And again, at the time, super stoked.
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.64 Yes, the big mission was taking out these vessels.
00:30:57.64 --> 00:30:58.64 And it thought it was pretty cool.
00:30:58.64 --> 00:30:59.64 And it was cool.
00:30:59.64 --> 00:31:03.72 But you just didn't have anything to compare it to at all.
00:31:03.72 --> 00:31:04.72 Yeah.
00:31:04.72 --> 00:31:06.52 So what happened?
00:31:06.52 --> 00:31:08.88 So I get back from that deployment.
00:31:08.88 --> 00:31:11.96 That's the summer of 2000.
00:31:11.96 --> 00:31:16.40 And shortly after that, I got selected by my commanding officer to go to Top Gun.
00:31:16.40 --> 00:31:20.04 So that was my first exposure to kind of advancing inside the squadron.
00:31:20.04 --> 00:31:22.12 So as a young guy, I've done almost two years in the squadron.
00:31:22.12 --> 00:31:25.88 I've been there for a little while and got some qualifications and grew and developed
00:31:25.88 --> 00:31:26.40 in the squadron.
00:31:26.40 --> 00:31:29.12 And they pick one or two guys every couple years from me,
00:31:29.12 --> 00:31:33.12 every squadron to go to the school and the whole point of going there is a U-Learn kind
00:31:33.12 --> 00:31:37.36 of this advanced, you know, it's like a master's degree basically in being a fighter pilot
00:31:37.36 --> 00:31:41.08 with the intent that you can bring back to the squadron and be one of the kind of key trainers
00:31:41.08 --> 00:31:42.08 a key leaders in the squadron.
00:31:42.08 --> 00:31:47.88 So I went to Top Gun early the next year, summer of, actually about a year later.
00:31:47.88 --> 00:31:53.44 So summer 2001, I got to Top Gun and I came back and we were just in a work outside.
00:31:53.44 --> 00:31:56.64 You showed up to Top Gun just sort of really knows.
00:31:56.64 --> 00:31:57.64 Yeah.
00:31:57.64 --> 00:32:02.04 I mean, especially because you were the big combat vet with bombs dropped and you feel
00:32:02.04 --> 00:32:05.16 like you're pretty much a complete stud.
00:32:05.16 --> 00:32:06.16 Yeah.
00:32:06.16 --> 00:32:10.40 And then you show up at Top Gun and the instructors just can completely annihilate.
00:32:10.40 --> 00:32:13.84 And just, first of all, as you don't know, it's, it's, you're learning how to dog fight
00:32:13.84 --> 00:32:20.40 mono, e mono against another guy and another plane like stock car racing because the
00:32:20.40 --> 00:32:24.80 planes are equal and it's you against the other guy and it was actually cool.
00:32:24.80 --> 00:32:28.04 You were explaining some of the rules and how you'd set it up and they have, you know,
00:32:28.04 --> 00:32:32.40 and you did, you know, you, you, you, you, okay, you know, you start standing, you know,
00:32:32.40 --> 00:32:33.80 you shake hands, bomb fist, I can now it's on.
00:32:33.80 --> 00:32:36.32 Well, with the Top Gun, they started a certain distance.
00:32:36.32 --> 00:32:39.60 They, they go towards each other at a certain altitude, certain distance away from each
00:32:39.60 --> 00:32:40.60 other.
00:32:40.60 --> 00:32:44.80 They go, they pass it a thousand feet, you know, left, left wing to left wing.
00:32:44.80 --> 00:32:46.88 And then once they pass, they say, what do you say?
00:32:46.88 --> 00:32:50.76 Game on fights on fights on fights on and then boom, now it's go.
00:32:50.76 --> 00:32:53.04 So that's how they start in their neutral position.
00:32:53.04 --> 00:32:58.36 And of course, when you show up there, it's just like you did to, in the fact that it's
00:32:58.36 --> 00:33:02.32 like a guy that did a little bit of training somewhere and then they show up at a G.
00:33:02.32 --> 00:33:04.28 G. G. G. G. G. G. and they're going to get totally destroyed.
00:33:04.28 --> 00:33:06.56 So he shows up, you show up at this thing.
00:33:06.56 --> 00:33:07.56 Yeah.
00:33:07.56 --> 00:33:11.32 And, and you think you're, again, big combat that you just get annihilated.
00:33:11.32 --> 00:33:12.32 Totally.
00:33:12.32 --> 00:33:14.84 So yeah, I get that I had dropped a bomb, that's singular.
00:33:14.84 --> 00:33:16.60 I had dropped a bomb and bomb.
00:33:16.60 --> 00:33:19.16 And I was, I was, I was a big deal.
00:33:19.16 --> 00:33:22.52 I do that dropped a bomb, you know, and so at the time I was, I, I thought,
00:33:22.52 --> 00:33:24.32 some of the instructors had never done that before, right?
00:33:24.32 --> 00:33:26.08 Most of them, like you said, there's the drier.
00:33:26.08 --> 00:33:27.32 So it just wasn't a ton going on.
00:33:27.32 --> 00:33:31.60 You had a story here and there, but I think more than anything in my own mind, you
00:33:31.60 --> 00:33:33.48 kind of build up like I got some game here, man.
00:33:33.48 --> 00:33:35.48 I'm going to watch this.
00:33:35.48 --> 00:33:37.28 You know, I'm going to do some good work here.
00:33:37.28 --> 00:33:39.68 And, you know, I done well enough of my squadron.
00:33:39.68 --> 00:33:41.84 And I was one of the guys that got picked to go to school, so you,
00:33:41.84 --> 00:33:43.52 which is another little confidence boost.
00:33:43.52 --> 00:33:44.52 Yeah, it is.
00:33:44.52 --> 00:33:45.52 So your egos getting fed.
00:33:45.52 --> 00:33:47.52 It's getting forced fed.
00:33:47.52 --> 00:33:48.52 Maybe.
00:33:48.52 --> 00:33:49.52 Yeah, a little bit.
00:33:49.52 --> 00:33:51.84 Yeah, you're feeling pretty good about yourself.
00:33:51.84 --> 00:33:53.16 And so you go up there.
00:33:53.16 --> 00:33:58.04 And like you said, so you know, you're, you're a student, you know,
00:33:58.04 --> 00:34:01.48 you're not going to be as good as the instructors, but what you don't know is that
00:34:01.48 --> 00:34:05.08 you're not just going to lose, you're going to get, you're not just going to lose
00:34:05.08 --> 00:34:06.84 or get annihilated, you're not even going to know what happened.
00:34:06.84 --> 00:34:09.24 It's going to be over and you're going to kind of be flying back and before you,
00:34:09.24 --> 00:34:12.72 you're going to land and you're not going to be able to explain what just occurred.
00:34:12.72 --> 00:34:16.96 I mean, it occurs in a way that it's so, it's hard to explain.
00:34:16.96 --> 00:34:18.96 It's like you weren't there.
00:34:18.96 --> 00:34:21.96 It's really, it's humbling.
00:34:21.96 --> 00:34:26.12 I mean, Jacob, we're talking the very first flight on the very first day.
00:34:26.12 --> 00:34:29.96 My very first event, the very first flight of the first flight.
00:34:29.96 --> 00:34:34.16 It was over in like 20 seconds in the instructor was saying, okay, let's call it and say,
00:34:34.16 --> 00:34:35.16 knock it off when we're done.
00:34:35.16 --> 00:34:36.84 We're going to start and set it up again.
00:34:36.84 --> 00:34:38.68 And any right then, I was totally in over my head.
00:34:38.68 --> 00:34:40.60 The very first one.
00:34:40.60 --> 00:34:46.60 And it was so my first flight was, it was so bad that when I landed, we're walking back
00:34:46.60 --> 00:34:50.48 in to, you go to maintenance and you basically go back and turn the airplane back in and
00:34:50.48 --> 00:34:54.08 so they can fix it and then what you're supposed to just walk across through to the squadron
00:34:54.08 --> 00:34:56.16 hanger and talk about it.
00:34:56.16 --> 00:34:58.40 And I'm in my gear and you're supposed to get on dress out of your flight gear and go
00:34:58.40 --> 00:35:01.000 and he's like, hey, don't get on dress.
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000 And we're going, right?
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000 Right?
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000 Right?
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.20 He's like, why don't we just go do that again?
00:35:05.20 --> 00:35:07.76 It was bad enough that we didn't even need to talk about it.
00:35:07.76 --> 00:35:12.28 We just needed to just, hey, and he's like, hey, why don't you just take a deep breath, man?
00:35:12.28 --> 00:35:18.08 And we went and did that flight without even talking about the first one.
00:35:18.08 --> 00:35:22.28 So I kind of knew I had some work to do.
00:35:22.28 --> 00:35:27.60 So top gun is really good about not just humbling you, but obviously it teaches you a
00:35:27.60 --> 00:35:28.60 ton.
00:35:28.60 --> 00:35:29.60 It's a six at the time.
00:35:29.60 --> 00:35:33.96 It was only six weeks for the Marines because we didn't do some of the syllabus that
00:35:33.96 --> 00:35:36.60 the Navy did because we got it elsewhere.
00:35:36.60 --> 00:35:39.80 And it's six weeks where you start with literally just you against another guy, one against
00:35:39.80 --> 00:35:44.76 one and you end up building up to where it's, you know, six to eight of you on the front,
00:35:44.76 --> 00:35:49.04 on the blue side, the friendly side against, you know, 15, 20 simulated adversary.
00:35:49.04 --> 00:35:52.60 So it's a, it's a, a lot in a short period of time.
00:35:52.60 --> 00:35:57.12 And that idea of being like really bad when you start happens over and over again in the
00:35:57.12 --> 00:35:58.12 course.
00:35:58.12 --> 00:36:00.84 So you get through the one V1 phase and at the end, like, oh, finally I got this one V1 thing.
00:36:00.84 --> 00:36:01.84 I got this thing wired.
00:36:01.84 --> 00:36:02.84 I can do this.
00:36:02.84 --> 00:36:03.84 Like, all right, cool.
00:36:03.84 --> 00:36:06.80 And I'm going to go two against whatever and you just get rolled again.
00:36:06.80 --> 00:36:08.12 And you're like, I'm back to square one.
00:36:08.12 --> 00:36:12.12 So it builds you up and breaks you down and builds you up, standard military, you know,
00:36:12.12 --> 00:36:14.04 just breaks you down to your pieces.
00:36:14.04 --> 00:36:18.76 And then the guys there that instructors are so, they're obviously really good.
00:36:18.76 --> 00:36:20.36 I mean, that part is sort of speaks for yourself.
00:36:20.36 --> 00:36:21.20 They're really good on the airplane.
00:36:21.20 --> 00:36:24.08 But what makes them unique is that they're exceptional teachers.
00:36:24.08 --> 00:36:25.56 So you learn a ton.
00:36:25.56 --> 00:36:29.32 So by the time, a lot of the time you finished up gun, that, that image in the mirror, we
00:36:29.32 --> 00:36:30.84 know like, man, that dude was awesome.
00:36:30.84 --> 00:36:31.84 They get shattered.
00:36:31.84 --> 00:36:33.88 It's actually all back together by the time you leave.
00:36:33.88 --> 00:36:36.52 And as you leave there, like, you got that patch in your shoulder.
00:36:36.52 --> 00:36:40.12 You fly back, you get the patch in the last day, you get up in your airplane, F-18 with
00:36:40.12 --> 00:36:42.96 my name, Pan on the side with the top gun patch and I flew back to Merrimar.
00:36:42.96 --> 00:36:47.40 See, you dream is getting better.
00:36:47.40 --> 00:36:49.40 But there's been enough reminders.
00:36:49.40 --> 00:36:53.88 Like, yeah, I should probably maybe cool out a little bit.
00:36:53.88 --> 00:36:56.68 You start to just learn that there's always guys out there that are significantly better
00:36:56.68 --> 00:36:57.68 than you.
00:36:57.68 --> 00:36:59.64 And you keep climbing up the hill.
00:36:59.64 --> 00:37:02.68 But finishing top gun as a student, you feel like you've hit the top of the mountain,
00:37:02.68 --> 00:37:06.16 but you realize, because the guys you've been working with, there's an awful long
00:37:06.16 --> 00:37:07.000 way to go.
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.36 You at least know what you don't know.
00:37:08.36 --> 00:37:09.52 Yeah, that's a great way to put it.
00:37:09.52 --> 00:37:11.000 You know what you don't know.
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.88 And you're there's a lot that you don't know.
00:37:12.88 --> 00:37:14.44 And so it kind of dispels all those feeling.
00:37:14.44 --> 00:37:15.40 You know, we went through flight school.
00:37:15.40 --> 00:37:17.72 Like, wow, I'm a finished flight school.
00:37:17.72 --> 00:37:18.72 I got to F-18s.
00:37:18.72 --> 00:37:20.20 I've really got this flying thing nail.
00:37:20.20 --> 00:37:24.04 And you're barely functional in your plane compared to these other guys.
00:37:24.04 --> 00:37:29.60 And when you get to a place like top gun, it's just such a concentration of talent.
00:37:29.60 --> 00:37:31.32 You, it's good as it feels.
00:37:31.32 --> 00:37:34.96 You actually, the thing you get the most out of the humility, because you just got crushed
00:37:34.96 --> 00:37:35.96 for six weeks.
00:37:35.96 --> 00:37:37.96 And hopefully you learned something out of it.
00:37:37.96 --> 00:37:41.48 And you're supposed to take that back and teach the guys in your squadron all those
00:37:41.48 --> 00:37:42.48 same lessons.
00:37:42.48 --> 00:37:44.96 And so my expectation was I was going to go back from top gun.
00:37:44.96 --> 00:37:49.52 I was going to spend another two years, 18 months in the squadron as a kind of the senior
00:37:49.52 --> 00:37:50.52 instructors.
00:37:50.52 --> 00:37:52.28 And then go on to something else.
00:37:52.28 --> 00:37:56.36 And I didn't know exactly what that was at the time.
00:37:56.36 --> 00:37:57.52 But as I'm leaving, no joke.
00:37:57.52 --> 00:38:01.16 My last day, I remember the guy who asked me, is actually the same guy that's going
00:38:01.16 --> 00:38:02.64 to do my retirement here in a couple months.
00:38:02.64 --> 00:38:07.48 I came out of you, thought about coming back to being instructor top gun after this
00:38:07.48 --> 00:38:09.56 tour in your squadron's over.
00:38:09.56 --> 00:38:12.76 And I try to play a cool, like, oh, let me go home and think about that.
00:38:12.76 --> 00:38:16.80 But clearly, there wasn't a lot to think about there.
00:38:16.80 --> 00:38:19.96 So I left there with kind of an inclination that I might get asked back.
00:38:19.96 --> 00:38:21.32 And I was pretty stoked about that.
00:38:21.32 --> 00:38:22.56 They didn't formalize it.
00:38:22.56 --> 00:38:27.36 But he was a senior IP on the staff, the senior Marine there as well.
00:38:27.36 --> 00:38:29.28 A real respected guy in Marine aviation.
00:38:29.28 --> 00:38:30.28 And he had given me a sit down.
00:38:30.28 --> 00:38:32.32 So I was hoping that that was going to happen.
00:38:32.32 --> 00:38:33.48 But I also thought I had time.
00:38:33.48 --> 00:38:36.36 I thought I was, this is July 2001.
00:38:36.36 --> 00:38:40.76 And obviously six weeks later, 9-11 hits.
00:38:40.76 --> 00:38:42.64 And so all that calculus kind of changed.
00:38:42.64 --> 00:38:47.28 And very quickly, my squadron, which was on this regular cycle of preparing to go to,
00:38:47.28 --> 00:38:51.12 what was going to be another Southern Watch deployment, just like we did, that whole thing
00:38:51.12 --> 00:38:53.44 had changed.
00:38:53.44 --> 00:38:55.96 Because of September 11th.
00:38:55.96 --> 00:38:58.16 So what happens on September 11th for you?
00:38:58.16 --> 00:39:03.52 Yeah, you were active in a squadron getting ready for work in the morning.
00:39:03.52 --> 00:39:04.52 Totally.
00:39:04.52 --> 00:39:06.20 I'm stationed right up the road here.
00:39:06.20 --> 00:39:08.40 Five miles north of the air is a ringer station, Miramar.
00:39:08.40 --> 00:39:13.72 I'm on my second half of my first tour as a pilot and a 182-ajron.
00:39:13.72 --> 00:39:15.04 I'd already done that one deployment.
00:39:15.04 --> 00:39:17.04 And I had a routine down.
00:39:17.04 --> 00:39:18.04 I was getting up.
00:39:18.04 --> 00:39:20.32 I was probably, I guess it was probably five in the morning.
00:39:20.32 --> 00:39:22.04 I'm sitting at the foot of my bed, listening to my boots.
00:39:22.04 --> 00:39:25.56 I could did every day to just get in the car and drive into work and click on the TV.
00:39:25.56 --> 00:39:31.56 And I see, we've stayed at a clock back east around that time and I see what's going on.
00:39:31.56 --> 00:39:34.20 And I think, you know, same story for all this kind of piece of together very quickly.
00:39:34.20 --> 00:39:35.20 Hey, this is an accident.
00:39:35.20 --> 00:39:36.20 This is something's really happening.
00:39:36.20 --> 00:39:37.92 You can see the second building.
00:39:37.92 --> 00:39:42.72 And it, very quickly, kind of, clicks in like, this is the real thing.
00:39:42.72 --> 00:39:45.32 And I knew, I knew we were going to go to war.
00:39:45.32 --> 00:39:48.16 I didn't know what, I obviously didn't know the details, but I knew things were going
00:39:48.16 --> 00:39:49.56 to change really dramatically.
00:39:49.56 --> 00:39:53.64 As a matter of fact, my drive to work, which normally would have taken me 10 minutes or
00:39:53.64 --> 00:39:57.32 never 15 minutes, something short drive to get up into the base.
00:39:57.32 --> 00:40:01.16 It was like three hours to get on the base, you know, they're inspecting it, reviical, you know,
00:40:01.16 --> 00:40:05.96 every car getting pulled over, dodgers, you know, the whole nine yards that just the security.
00:40:05.96 --> 00:40:07.44 It was pretty chaotic.
00:40:07.44 --> 00:40:09.40 He was kind of mayhem.
00:40:09.40 --> 00:40:14.08 And I drive into my squadron and half of my squadron had already not half, but a good number
00:40:14.08 --> 00:40:17.72 of guys that already been up to Fallen, which was where we're going to go for training.
00:40:17.72 --> 00:40:21.12 The same place the top one is, it was just part of a normal training cycle.
00:40:21.12 --> 00:40:26.000 My squadron commander at the time, an awesome guy called me because he'd gone up there.
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.28 And I was supposed to bring the, you know, be part of the second half of that went up there.
00:40:29.28 --> 00:40:32.20 He's like, hey man, you need to go brief.
00:40:32.20 --> 00:40:35.80 You're going to be the lead of a foreship of aircraft.
00:40:35.80 --> 00:40:38.52 We don't know all the details yet, but we're going to, they're going to call you, they're
00:40:38.52 --> 00:40:39.72 going to find live ordinance.
00:40:39.72 --> 00:40:44.04 And you're going to have to fly an air patrol, a common air patrol mission called
00:40:44.04 --> 00:40:48.20 of the cap, because there are still a bunch of airliners that were still airborne coming
00:40:48.20 --> 00:40:52.44 in from places like Japan and Korea these long haul, you know, 12, 13, 14, our flights.
00:40:52.44 --> 00:40:54.52 There's a whole bunch of airplanes airborne.
00:40:54.52 --> 00:40:58.32 And we didn't know if those, there's potential issue with those airplanes.
00:40:58.32 --> 00:41:01.80 You know, if they're going to try to do the same thing back east of the day, that west, total
00:41:01.80 --> 00:41:02.80 chaos.
00:41:02.80 --> 00:41:06.96 And I had just recently graduated from Topkins, so I was like, hey, you're the lead.
00:41:06.96 --> 00:41:08.64 And we didn't have a good, we didn't know what the mission was.
00:41:08.64 --> 00:41:13.16 I mean, it was basically one of those things where we're supposed to get airborne and somehow
00:41:13.16 --> 00:41:16.52 between us and some other control, we're going to kind of determine if a particular aircraft
00:41:16.52 --> 00:41:17.84 might have been a threat.
00:41:17.84 --> 00:41:19.52 And now has happened all over the country.
00:41:19.52 --> 00:41:23.80 People were in their aircraft Air Force Navy Marine pilots who were just launching to do
00:41:23.80 --> 00:41:28.96 these protection missions of what ended becoming something called Operation Noble Eagle,
00:41:28.96 --> 00:41:30.32 which started on September 11th.
00:41:30.32 --> 00:41:35.52 And it was this aviation overwatch of key cities and key locations.
00:41:35.52 --> 00:41:37.32 And we were totally clueless on what that was.
00:41:37.32 --> 00:41:40.96 Now, I ended up not launching, but it didn't happen.
00:41:40.96 --> 00:41:43.60 You know, but we did the brief, we were getting ready to go.
00:41:43.60 --> 00:41:49.48 It was just kind of that moment of chaos of we were on our heels and talking didn't prepare
00:41:49.48 --> 00:41:50.48 me for that.
00:41:50.48 --> 00:41:55.28 I didn't have a sense of what it was to do with an airliner, you know, filled with civilians
00:41:55.28 --> 00:41:58.64 on some route coming from Japan and trying to figure out what I would do.
00:41:58.64 --> 00:42:01.76 If somebody said, hey, that aircraft, we've figured out that aircraft is going to try
00:42:01.76 --> 00:42:05.04 to fly into a building or crash into an airport or something like that.
00:42:05.04 --> 00:42:09.96 It was just, you know, just kind of mayhem and it was, you know, it's tough to start off.
00:42:09.96 --> 00:42:15.56 The idea being that if that is suspected of happening or they can somehow confirm that's
00:42:15.56 --> 00:42:21.20 going to happen, then you or one of your mates is going to have to shoot down a civilian
00:42:21.20 --> 00:42:22.20 aircraft.
00:42:22.20 --> 00:42:23.20 That's what they're thinking.
00:42:23.20 --> 00:42:24.20 Yeah, exactly.
00:42:24.20 --> 00:42:27.60 And that was something I never considered.
00:42:27.60 --> 00:42:30.84 Um, you know, there's anybody to consider that at that point.
00:42:30.84 --> 00:42:33.96 And I've read there's some, you know, there's some pilots that actually ended up launching
00:42:33.96 --> 00:42:34.96 out in the East Coast.
00:42:34.96 --> 00:42:38.84 I've read a couple articles of pilots that took off in their F-16s here in DC, because
00:42:38.84 --> 00:42:44.24 obviously it was with the Pentagon up in DC in the New York City that actually did get airborne
00:42:44.24 --> 00:42:47.36 and they had missions to do exactly that.
00:42:47.36 --> 00:42:50.84 Um, so in some sense, I was pretty lucky that I didn't have to go through that calculus,
00:42:50.84 --> 00:42:53.76 but I still can picture where I'm sitting, given that brief with three other pilots, kind
00:42:53.76 --> 00:42:56.04 of like we're sitting today.
00:42:56.04 --> 00:43:00.20 And we're even asking ourselves, like, well, how do you, I mean, how do you shoot down an
00:43:00.20 --> 00:43:01.20 airline?
00:43:01.20 --> 00:43:03.56 You know, what, what would we actually go through to do?
00:43:03.56 --> 00:43:07.40 How do we determine, you know, when we were talking, kind of trying to talk through that
00:43:07.40 --> 00:43:12.44 and the idea that an airliner filled with civilians, and we knew, you know, at that
00:43:12.44 --> 00:43:15.92 point that those other airliners are regular commercial airplanes that just took off,
00:43:15.92 --> 00:43:19.36 they're going their flight and they crash, we knew everybody on board, you know, nobody's
00:43:19.36 --> 00:43:20.36 going to survive that.
00:43:20.36 --> 00:43:25.16 And so it was just a very strange way to start what ended up being kind of a cycle of war
00:43:25.16 --> 00:43:29.36 that, you know, we've all been through for years now, that morning of getting that call
00:43:29.36 --> 00:43:30.76 from the CO, hey, this is what you're doing.
00:43:30.76 --> 00:43:33.04 And, you know, that was the beginning.
00:43:33.04 --> 00:43:37.42 Shortly, very shortly that route within a day or two, no, actually, I think probably that
00:43:37.42 --> 00:43:42.08 late afternoon, and certainly by the next day, my squadron was one of the several squadrons
00:43:42.08 --> 00:43:43.72 that was tasked to go back out on the carrier.
00:43:43.72 --> 00:43:45.28 So we split the squadron in half.
00:43:45.28 --> 00:43:50.40 That same CO that called me, he took guys from Fallon flew onto the ship onto the carrier,
00:43:50.40 --> 00:43:52.52 right off the coast of LAX.
00:43:52.52 --> 00:43:54.56 And I still, we, we talked about this.
00:43:54.56 --> 00:43:55.56 I can picture to this day.
00:43:55.56 --> 00:44:00.24 I took off at San Diego and flying overhead, Los Angeles International Airport, and we had guys
00:44:00.24 --> 00:44:04.32 that taken off in the carrier that had life missiles, and they were doing a cap, and I'm
00:44:04.32 --> 00:44:08.84 flying, you know, kind of opposite direction overhead, LAX looking down, and, you know,
00:44:08.84 --> 00:44:12.44 I grew up in San Diego, where LAX, like one of the busiest airports in the world, planes
00:44:12.44 --> 00:44:16.28 all over the tarmac on the runways, on the taxiways, because there's, everybody landed,
00:44:16.28 --> 00:44:17.28 nobody took off.
00:44:17.28 --> 00:44:18.60 There's no controllers.
00:44:18.60 --> 00:44:22.52 And they're doing this cap mission, where they're just flying overhead, LAX, kind
00:44:22.52 --> 00:44:27.000 of largely unknown what's going on, and just that moment of seriality of, I'm airborne.
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.72 And there's nobody else flying.
00:44:29.72 --> 00:44:33.12 And we're just sort of just waiting for something to happen, and, you know, it's kind
00:44:33.12 --> 00:44:37.88 of one of those, hey, you'll get more specific instructions as we figure it out.
00:44:37.88 --> 00:44:40.80 You know, the leadership was, was scrambling, everybody's much as we were, and kind of
00:44:40.80 --> 00:44:44.68 looking down, thinking this is, this is a whole new world.
00:44:44.68 --> 00:44:48.96 You know, this is not Southern Watch, you know, that mission we've been doing.
00:44:48.96 --> 00:44:53.84 And within, maybe six weeks, we, we steamed out.
00:44:53.84 --> 00:44:57.64 We, we, we loaded the carrier a couple months early, put the squadron, the whole air wing,
00:44:57.64 --> 00:45:02.08 got on board the, the carrier and steamed out towards the North of the Rivian Gulf to go
00:45:02.08 --> 00:45:05.88 do what we call it as Operation during Freedom.
00:45:05.88 --> 00:45:09.64 So late 2001, I think it was maybe November of 2001.
00:45:09.64 --> 00:45:11.36 We were going to war.
00:45:11.36 --> 00:45:13.36 And our Afghanistan was where the war was.
00:45:13.36 --> 00:45:15.16 You remember at the time, that was it.
00:45:15.16 --> 00:45:16.36 There was nothing else going on.
00:45:16.36 --> 00:45:17.72 We went to Afghanistan.
00:45:17.72 --> 00:45:24.40 So I did a seven month cruise on a carrier from November of 2001.
00:45:24.40 --> 00:45:30.48 I think we came back April May of 2002 and did combat operations over Afghanistan.
00:45:30.48 --> 00:45:32.20 And, you know, a lot more rewarding.
00:45:32.20 --> 00:45:34.32 And so a lot of this year, we did a mission at the time.
00:45:34.32 --> 00:45:35.32 It was called Operation Anaconda.
00:45:35.32 --> 00:45:36.84 I think I'm going to ask you about that.
00:45:36.84 --> 00:45:38.40 That was like the largest ground offensive.
00:45:38.40 --> 00:45:39.40 Yeah.
00:45:39.40 --> 00:45:41.68 We had supported this desert storm.
00:45:41.68 --> 00:45:48.04 And when we came back in April, April, May of 2002, we thought we'd sort of largely
00:45:48.04 --> 00:45:49.04 won the war.
00:45:49.04 --> 00:45:50.84 We, we thought we'd accomplished most of our mission.
00:45:50.84 --> 00:45:54.88 We left thinking, hey, this thing is winding down. We're feeling pretty good about it.
00:45:54.88 --> 00:45:59.48 And when I got back in May of 2002, I kind of distinctly remember, like, I just had my
00:45:59.48 --> 00:46:00.48 work experience.
00:46:00.48 --> 00:46:03.60 You know, as a pilot in combat, and you know, I'd done so to watch, but obviously, you
00:46:03.60 --> 00:46:04.60 know, nothing like this.
00:46:04.60 --> 00:46:07.000 And, but I'd done a combat deployment off of carrier.
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.24 You're supported troops on the ground and Afghanistan dropping bombs and flying off
00:46:11.24 --> 00:46:12.24 cars.
00:46:12.24 --> 00:46:13.24 I kind of thought that was it.
00:46:13.24 --> 00:46:14.24 I think a lot of us did.
00:46:14.24 --> 00:46:16.24 Yeah, a lot of us did.
00:46:16.24 --> 00:46:19.24 I know I thought that might come back from my first deployment to Iraq.
00:46:19.24 --> 00:46:24.08 I was kind of, you know, I'm thankful that I got to do this deployment.
00:46:24.08 --> 00:46:26.28 And I thought they can't go on that much longer.
00:46:26.28 --> 00:46:30.92 But I mean, really quickly, after we got back, it spiraled and I said, oh, this is going
00:46:30.92 --> 00:46:31.92 to be a while.
00:46:31.92 --> 00:46:33.92 Yeah, big time.
00:46:33.92 --> 00:46:38.72 You know, while I was on that deployment, I had gotten email from Top Gun.
00:46:38.72 --> 00:46:42.08 I was saying, hey, I want to come up here next summer, being a structure.
00:46:42.08 --> 00:46:47.000 So I came back in May of that deployment, knowing that my next step was going to go back
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000 up to Fallen.
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.32 I was feeling pretty good about that.
00:46:50.32 --> 00:46:52.72 I was pretty pumped to know what was next.
00:46:52.72 --> 00:46:58.04 And, you know, in that period of time, it came back, you know, I'm packing up that summer
00:46:58.04 --> 00:47:02.84 and moving out in the fall and already the gears are starting to turn for what end to
00:47:02.84 --> 00:47:04.44 be an operation Iraqi freedom.
00:47:04.44 --> 00:47:07.24 You know, it's the writing is on the wall that this is, we're not done.
00:47:07.24 --> 00:47:08.60 I mean, we're really just getting started.
00:47:08.60 --> 00:47:11.04 And it was several months before that I'll kick off.
00:47:11.04 --> 00:47:15.44 I think everybody in the military certainly knew this is which way it's going to happen.
00:47:15.44 --> 00:47:18.12 And I think there are some things along the way that we're supposed to occur.
00:47:18.12 --> 00:47:20.12 But we all knew this was coming.
00:47:20.12 --> 00:47:23.08 Certainly, you know, it kicked off in March of the fall of the year.
00:47:23.08 --> 00:47:25.24 It wasn't a big surprise to any of us.
00:47:25.24 --> 00:47:26.24 And I was up at Fallen.
00:47:26.24 --> 00:47:30.32 Kind of watching that whole thing roll and I realized that that deployment that I just
00:47:30.32 --> 00:47:34.76 finished was not the end of what we were doing as a country and trying to deal with this
00:47:34.76 --> 00:47:35.76 problem.
00:47:35.76 --> 00:47:40.36 And then you show up at Top Gun to be an instructor, which is, you know, you said the
00:47:40.36 --> 00:47:42.72 going to Top Gun was like a masters.
00:47:42.72 --> 00:47:45.60 And so now it's beyond a doctorate, right?
00:47:45.60 --> 00:47:46.60 I mean, it's.
00:47:46.60 --> 00:47:48.08 Yeah, and we say it's the PhD.
00:47:48.08 --> 00:47:52.96 I mean, in our business, certainly is a for a Marine or naval aviator of fighter pilot.
00:47:52.96 --> 00:47:53.96 That's it.
00:47:53.96 --> 00:47:56.76 Top Gun kind of represents the schoolhouse.
00:47:56.76 --> 00:47:58.92 It's the place where you want to be.
00:47:58.92 --> 00:48:01.56 And as an instructor, you have a huge amount of responsibility.
00:48:01.56 --> 00:48:04.48 It's a bunch of sort of mid career guys.
00:48:04.48 --> 00:48:05.48 It's Navy Lieutenant.
00:48:05.48 --> 00:48:06.92 It's Marine Corps captains.
00:48:06.92 --> 00:48:09.12 Maybe a junior major or a junior lieutenant commander.
00:48:09.12 --> 00:48:13.28 But it's run by relatively young guys.
00:48:13.28 --> 00:48:16.44 As a head maybe a full deployment under the belt, you know, quickly guys were coming
00:48:16.44 --> 00:48:18.24 and having done Afghanistan, combat operations.
00:48:18.24 --> 00:48:21.04 Guys coming having done Iraq, combat operations.
00:48:21.04 --> 00:48:26.24 So in the time that I was there from O2 to O5, the combat experience on the staff went
00:48:26.24 --> 00:48:29.68 from basically none to everybody.
00:48:29.68 --> 00:48:30.68 Everybody.
00:48:30.68 --> 00:48:31.68 Every single dude had been in combat.
00:48:31.68 --> 00:48:35.44 It was coming off a long deployment where they had done back to back to POMISI, Iraq
00:48:35.44 --> 00:48:36.44 and Afghanistan.
00:48:36.44 --> 00:48:39.44 Guys that I knew had done 10 month deployments to Iraq on a carrier.
00:48:39.44 --> 00:48:45.72 I mean, really seasoned guys where just one generation to three years prior, not a single
00:48:45.72 --> 00:48:48.20 person on the staff had seen any combat like that.
00:48:48.20 --> 00:48:52.20 So these acts same thing in the sealed teams we experienced, exact same thing.
00:48:52.20 --> 00:48:57.56 Going from zero or close to zero combat experiencing that it's an odd guy that had done
00:48:57.56 --> 00:49:03.56 little operation here there to every single guy except for the new guys.
00:49:03.56 --> 00:49:06.20 And then, but you're learning curve.
00:49:06.20 --> 00:49:09.40 When you show back up there, it was just as steep as the first time.
00:49:09.40 --> 00:49:10.40 Yeah, without a doubt.
00:49:10.40 --> 00:49:15.12 So when you're there as a student and you don't understand a lot of what's going on
00:49:15.12 --> 00:49:17.96 as a student, at least on the instructor side, you know, they're not trying to keep anything
00:49:17.96 --> 00:49:22.12 from me, but you're just, you were so busy just trying to keep your head above water.
00:49:22.12 --> 00:49:25.72 You're not spending a lot of time wondering what the instructors are doing at the free time.
00:49:25.72 --> 00:49:31.40 You're just prepping for every brief, the flight may take an hour, but you've put in
00:49:31.40 --> 00:49:35.08 10 hours of work ahead of time and you've debrief for six hours and when you're done,
00:49:35.08 --> 00:49:37.44 you need to go start the next prep process again for you.
00:49:37.44 --> 00:49:43.44 So you are just all day, every day thinking about your next flight and getting ready for
00:49:43.44 --> 00:49:44.56 that and the thing is going on.
00:49:44.56 --> 00:49:48.80 So in your learning curve as steep as a student, when you get there as an instructor
00:49:48.80 --> 00:49:51.000 and I didn't know this at the time, you get there.
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.52 When you're there as an instructor, you have certainly been selected to a pretty elite
00:49:55.52 --> 00:50:02.04 group of folks, but you don't teach a student at Topkin when you're an instructor for a year.
00:50:02.04 --> 00:50:05.000 They spend an entire year with you as an instructor.
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.16 There's only 25 guys on the staff.
00:50:07.16 --> 00:50:10.88 So a third of you basically, if you kind of do the math or sequester for an entire year,
00:50:10.88 --> 00:50:14.16 just going through what's called, we call it the IUT, the instructor under training.
00:50:14.16 --> 00:50:18.20 And they're just teaching you how to teach students.
00:50:18.20 --> 00:50:23.04 And in that year, you're now flying all these different training missions with the instructors
00:50:23.04 --> 00:50:27.72 that are training you to be instructor and you're getting annihilated again.
00:50:27.72 --> 00:50:31.52 So that whole continuum of, well, I'm pretty good.
00:50:31.52 --> 00:50:32.72 You were reminded very quickly.
00:50:32.72 --> 00:50:34.16 And so it takes an entire year.
00:50:34.16 --> 00:50:37.48 And now the good news about that is that by the time you're finishing your initial instructor
00:50:37.48 --> 00:50:40.56 qualification, you can go teach students.
00:50:40.56 --> 00:50:44.04 You have been flying more than you've ever flown in your territory.
00:50:44.04 --> 00:50:48.000 I mean, I'm flying two, three times a day sometimes for a year.
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.92 And so you're just getting reps and reps and reps.
00:50:50.92 --> 00:50:54.16 And you have got more reps, I think, than anybody in aviation.
00:50:54.16 --> 00:50:57.92 So when the time you get your first student is sitting down, you're very first student brief.
00:50:57.92 --> 00:51:00.64 Your A game has been elevated, you know, quite a bit.
00:51:00.64 --> 00:51:05.64 And you're able to fly with the students and teach them way more effective week as,
00:51:05.64 --> 00:51:07.88 when I finished top gun, I went to Afghanistan.
00:51:07.88 --> 00:51:10.88 I didn't do a single air to air mission for almost a year.
00:51:10.88 --> 00:51:11.68 I was dropping bombs.
00:51:11.68 --> 00:51:14.12 I was doing cast and, oh, those are other type of missions.
00:51:14.12 --> 00:51:18.64 So when I got there, I was, I was pretty rusty on the skill sets.
00:51:18.64 --> 00:51:21.64 A year of flying with instructors will resolve that.
00:51:21.64 --> 00:51:22.64 Pretty much.
00:51:22.64 --> 00:51:27.64 Just the amount of flying that you get, you know, in just a week called Matt time.
00:51:27.64 --> 00:51:32.40 But for a normal pilot, you're not even getting a fraction of that, right?
00:51:32.40 --> 00:51:33.40 A fraction.
00:51:33.40 --> 00:51:38.20 Not only you're not getting a fraction of it, a lot of the time that you're flying is when
00:51:38.20 --> 00:51:41.80 you're not a top gun is, you know, sometimes you do an admin flying just flying two
00:51:41.80 --> 00:51:42.80 and from different places.
00:51:42.80 --> 00:51:45.64 Sometimes you're just prepping for a very particular mission.
00:51:45.64 --> 00:51:49.56 You know, it takes a skill to, you know, the missions are getting ready to drop bombs or do
00:51:49.56 --> 00:51:52.28 armor, condits, and so different types of flying.
00:51:52.28 --> 00:51:53.88 You don't get to see all of it.
00:51:53.88 --> 00:51:56.04 You get to see a pretty narrow amount of top gun.
00:51:56.04 --> 00:51:59.24 You get exposed to everything repeatedly.
00:51:59.24 --> 00:52:02.96 And so that one against one that we talked about, that we call BFM, basic fighter maneuvers,
00:52:02.96 --> 00:52:06.52 which is just you and another guy fighting two airplanes.
00:52:06.52 --> 00:52:10.88 You do that a ton, but you do all the other things just as much.
00:52:10.88 --> 00:52:15.64 So you get exposed to the PhD part of it isn't just the reps.
00:52:15.64 --> 00:52:17.04 I think that's critical.
00:52:17.04 --> 00:52:21.12 But it's that you get exposed to this nuanced part of aviation that you just didn't even
00:52:21.12 --> 00:52:22.20 really know existed.
00:52:22.20 --> 00:52:26.72 So you get all the science, all the math, all the things that drive us to say this, why
00:52:26.72 --> 00:52:31.80 would do the things we do, then just get to practice it over and over and then you go back
00:52:31.80 --> 00:52:33.72 to the science and go, hey, I think there's some flaws here.
00:52:33.72 --> 00:52:34.72 Maybe some differences here.
00:52:34.72 --> 00:52:37.20 And the guys at top, kind of the one writing the manual.
00:52:37.20 --> 00:52:43.000 We literally write a manual for inches thick of all these different chapters of how to fly
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000 the airplane.
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.14 Everything from doing the one against one to dropping a bomb to mission planning, top
00:52:47.14 --> 00:52:48.14 gun owns that.
00:52:48.14 --> 00:52:53.86 Even a chapter in a book and a lecture that I was responsible for and the thing that was
00:52:53.86 --> 00:52:58.02 pretty amazing for me is when I got there, the mission set that I was responsible for
00:52:58.02 --> 00:53:02.82 my, my smear area, my subject matter, X-ray area was surface air threat and counter tactics.
00:53:02.82 --> 00:53:06.66 So I was the guy as a captain in the Marine Corps that was responsible for writing the
00:53:06.66 --> 00:53:11.82 chapter teaching the lecture and establishing our tactics for how to defeat threat surface
00:53:11.82 --> 00:53:14.14 air missiles in AAA.
00:53:14.14 --> 00:53:22.20 This was from September of 2002 to March 2003 that I was the guy that established the
00:53:22.20 --> 00:53:25.26 Navy Marine Corps's procedures and techniques and how we did that and taught that.
00:53:25.26 --> 00:53:29.10 So you know, I'm sorry, oh, I have kicks off.
00:53:29.10 --> 00:53:32.98 You know, guys that I'm, I had fun with and trained with or out there on deployments
00:53:32.98 --> 00:53:33.98 or write me letters.
00:53:33.98 --> 00:53:35.30 Hey, we're seeing this threat.
00:53:35.30 --> 00:53:36.30 What should we do here?
00:53:36.30 --> 00:53:39.70 You know, buddies of mine that I've grown up in aviation, I'm saying, hey, this is what
00:53:39.70 --> 00:53:40.70 we should do.
00:53:40.70 --> 00:53:42.66 This is how you should do with this particular case.
00:53:42.66 --> 00:53:47.22 So the responsibility as an IP, I think why is such a PhD type program is that your
00:53:47.22 --> 00:53:50.58 level responsibility grows, you have to be more than just a good pilot.
00:53:50.58 --> 00:53:54.74 You can teach anybody a good pilot, but if you can't teach and explain to other guys what
00:53:54.74 --> 00:53:57.78 they're doing and how to get better and how to keep themselves alive, you're kind of useless
00:53:57.78 --> 00:53:59.10 in combat.
00:53:59.10 --> 00:54:03.74 So it was a, it was, it was the best way or some of my life, man.
00:54:03.74 --> 00:54:05.74 It was, it was ridiculous.
00:54:05.74 --> 00:54:08.86 And we just flew every day, two, three times a day.
00:54:08.86 --> 00:54:10.18 I got qualified in the F-16.
00:54:10.18 --> 00:54:11.66 I got to fly a totally different airplane.
00:54:11.66 --> 00:54:17.54 So I was dual-qualled in an F-18 and an NF-16 as a Marine on a Navy base at a Navy command
00:54:17.54 --> 00:54:19.66 after having done two deployments on carriers.
00:54:19.66 --> 00:54:21.82 I mean, you cannot.
00:54:21.82 --> 00:54:25.62 It'd be like if I said, I need you to do jujitsu three days, two times a day, every day
00:54:25.62 --> 00:54:27.62 for three years.
00:54:27.62 --> 00:54:28.98 And you need, and that's all I need you to do.
00:54:28.98 --> 00:54:30.30 I don't need you to do anything else.
00:54:30.30 --> 00:54:31.30 Yeah.
00:54:31.30 --> 00:54:35.78 You know, I've actually done a Baxy ride in F-18 at Fowl and as a matter of fact.
00:54:35.78 --> 00:54:39.98 And one of the things that I think is important to understand, or at least from my perspective,
00:54:39.98 --> 00:54:44.18 one of the things that made it really cool was when you get an F-18, if you've never been
00:54:44.18 --> 00:54:46.94 in one, most people, you're not going to get the chance to get an F-18.
00:54:46.94 --> 00:54:47.94 And fly with it, right?
00:54:47.94 --> 00:54:51.22 So I'll give a little description of what I thought was one of the coolest parts about it.
00:54:51.22 --> 00:54:57.82 Is that if you look at the structure of an F-18, the, the, the pod that you sit in, the cockpit,
00:54:57.82 --> 00:55:02.46 is really far forward and the wings and the engine and our stuff are behind you.
00:55:02.46 --> 00:55:07.18 And it looks that way when you look at it, but when you get in it, you, those, those wings
00:55:07.18 --> 00:55:11.94 are so far behind you that you feel like you're in a superhero pod.
00:55:11.94 --> 00:55:15.10 You need to turn, you need to turn hard.
00:55:15.10 --> 00:55:20.26 You can't just look back to see the wings and it's a glass canopy that surrounds you.
00:55:20.26 --> 00:55:27.82 So you feel like you're just in a little pod that is moving at whatever, 800 miles an hour.
00:55:27.82 --> 00:55:29.74 And it's, it's, it's a, it's a crazy feeling.
00:55:29.74 --> 00:55:35.06 It's a crazy feeling because, because you're, it's deceiving because you just feel like you're
00:55:35.06 --> 00:55:37.22 in this little space pod.
00:55:37.22 --> 00:55:39.42 Somehow Star Wars powering through the air.
00:55:39.42 --> 00:55:43.70 You don't realize it behind you is, you know, tons of metal and machinery that's making
00:55:43.70 --> 00:55:44.70 this happen.
00:55:44.70 --> 00:55:47.26 And the G-force isn't all that stuff.
00:55:47.26 --> 00:55:51.70 It's, it's, it's, it's a very cool, very cool thing to experience.
00:55:51.70 --> 00:55:53.86 For me, I, I thought, yeah, that was awesome.
00:55:53.86 --> 00:55:56.38 I didn't think to myself, man, I should have been a pilot.
00:55:56.38 --> 00:56:00.82 There's some, there's some, I know you, we were talking about it yesterday.
00:56:00.82 --> 00:56:06.26 For you, the connection between man and machine is a really cool thing that you enjoy.
00:56:06.26 --> 00:56:08.74 For me, I don't like it.
00:56:08.74 --> 00:56:11.06 I don't like to rely on a machine.
00:56:11.06 --> 00:56:12.06 Yeah.
00:56:12.06 --> 00:56:15.18 I don't even, even get in Bradley's and stuff and Romadi, I always think, you know, I mean,
00:56:15.18 --> 00:56:17.98 I always was apprehensive about a big machine that I had to rely on.
00:56:17.98 --> 00:56:19.66 I don't want to rely on me.
00:56:19.66 --> 00:56:24.82 And what I could do, and that's why I had that little disconnect, I always, I still have
00:56:24.82 --> 00:56:27.50 it today, you know, that's why I'm waiting for the robot works.
00:56:27.50 --> 00:56:30.06 I want, I want to fight those things.
00:56:30.06 --> 00:56:36.46 So I just have a little disconnect with the machines, but I can see where people that
00:56:36.46 --> 00:56:38.14 are, I have that type of mindset.
00:56:38.14 --> 00:56:41.74 It's just, you know, it's just a complete equalizer as you were telling me last night.
00:56:41.74 --> 00:56:44.14 You're just like, it's a stock car race.
00:56:44.14 --> 00:56:50.14 It's you in the same plane as me and who is better is going to win.
00:56:50.14 --> 00:56:51.14 Period.
00:56:51.14 --> 00:56:52.14 That's it.
00:56:52.14 --> 00:56:53.42 There's really no excuses you can make.
00:56:53.42 --> 00:56:55.38 Yeah, that's one of my favorite things.
00:56:55.38 --> 00:56:59.74 It's always been one of my favorite things about flying fighters is that it's an equalizer.
00:56:59.74 --> 00:57:03.82 You don't get, you don't bring any advantage to that airplane.
00:57:03.82 --> 00:57:07.02 Now if we're going to train something, you made, there's guys that are bigger, the guys
00:57:07.02 --> 00:57:08.02 that are better aren't right.
00:57:08.02 --> 00:57:09.02 They got whatever.
00:57:09.02 --> 00:57:14.66 There's a whole bunch of ways that maybe you can bring an advantage.
00:57:14.66 --> 00:57:15.66 You lose all that.
00:57:15.66 --> 00:57:16.66 They've been used to it on that airplane.
00:57:16.66 --> 00:57:18.38 Because you're only going to go as fast as the airplane goes.
00:57:18.38 --> 00:57:19.50 You don't even pull as many jeezes.
00:57:19.50 --> 00:57:20.50 The airplane pulls.
00:57:20.50 --> 00:57:21.66 That's what you get.
00:57:21.66 --> 00:57:23.66 Now, you get a lot of all that stuff.
00:57:23.66 --> 00:57:24.46 I mean, it's awesome.
00:57:24.46 --> 00:57:30.58 But your success or your failure is 100% about how well you interact with that machine
00:57:30.58 --> 00:57:32.14 and compare to that other guy.
00:57:32.14 --> 00:57:35.26 And if you lose, you know, my engine, no.
00:57:35.26 --> 00:57:39.06 Well, I didn't have negative, you lost because you were worse than me today.
00:57:39.06 --> 00:57:40.06 Period.
00:57:40.06 --> 00:57:41.86 And look, you're going to find reasons why.
00:57:41.86 --> 00:57:43.94 We record every flight.
00:57:43.94 --> 00:57:46.86 We record our radar as we record our information, our display.
00:57:46.86 --> 00:57:49.14 So we can go back and dissect.
00:57:49.14 --> 00:57:52.62 And what you end up being able to do as an instructor is right there.
00:57:52.62 --> 00:57:53.66 That's why you lost.
00:57:53.66 --> 00:57:55.58 This decision you made here, this move you went.
00:57:55.58 --> 00:57:57.34 You went this direction or you went up or down.
00:57:57.34 --> 00:57:59.10 You decided to go this speed or whatnot.
00:57:59.10 --> 00:58:01.90 You can dissect every single flight.
00:58:01.90 --> 00:58:06.70 And the great instructors are the ones that can tell you, this is why I did this to you
00:58:06.70 --> 00:58:07.70 in 45 seconds.
00:58:07.70 --> 00:58:09.74 Because here, you made a decision.
00:58:09.74 --> 00:58:11.74 And it took me this long to capitalize it.
00:58:11.74 --> 00:58:15.70 But right now is where I took advantage of a mistake that you made.
00:58:15.70 --> 00:58:18.90 And you freeze that mistake and you put on a TV and they see it and they look at it and
00:58:18.90 --> 00:58:20.62 they burn it in their brain.
00:58:20.62 --> 00:58:24.02 And they make that mistake over and over and over and over and until eventually they don't
00:58:24.02 --> 00:58:25.02 make that mistake.
00:58:25.02 --> 00:58:26.70 And then you start to make your money as an instructor.
00:58:26.70 --> 00:58:34.10 But being an airplane, I brought every bit of capability that airplane had.
00:58:34.10 --> 00:58:35.10 And I never had it.
00:58:35.10 --> 00:58:37.82 There's no, you don't start at a disadvantage.
00:58:37.82 --> 00:58:40.58 And if you beat somebody, they have nobody to look at.
00:58:40.58 --> 00:58:41.58 No excuse.
00:58:41.58 --> 00:58:43.62 Nothing to blame except for their own performance.
00:58:43.62 --> 00:58:44.90 And I loved that.
00:58:44.90 --> 00:58:49.22 And I will always love that about being a fighter pilot.
00:58:49.22 --> 00:58:51.90 And then when you're flying to the left 16, now you have a different airplane.
00:58:51.90 --> 00:58:54.26 So hey, one of the planes faster than the other.
00:58:54.26 --> 00:58:55.74 One airplane actually turns better.
00:58:55.74 --> 00:59:00.74 And so now instead of it just being two totally equal platforms, it's one has particular
00:59:00.74 --> 00:59:03.02 strengths and weaknesses that are different than the other ones.
00:59:03.02 --> 00:59:06.38 So you better be really good about avoiding his strengths and getting, you know, and
00:59:06.38 --> 00:59:08.70 plan to his weaknesses and vice versa.
00:59:08.70 --> 00:59:10.90 And if you lose, guess what?
00:59:10.90 --> 00:59:12.22 It's still your fault.
00:59:12.22 --> 00:59:17.82 100% because instead of you having two similar airplanes, you couldn't identify what he was
00:59:17.82 --> 00:59:21.78 able to do better than you in his regime that he has, you know, you're strong with me
00:59:21.78 --> 00:59:22.78 fine.
00:59:22.78 --> 00:59:24.50 And then I'm going to try to be more agile than you.
00:59:24.50 --> 00:59:25.50 You know, you're quicker than me.
00:59:25.50 --> 00:59:28.54 Okay, well, I'm going to maybe try to outpower you those type of things and those games
00:59:28.54 --> 00:59:31.62 that you play kind of back and forth.
00:59:31.62 --> 00:59:34.70 There is no question at the end of a flight at Top Gun that you're fighting another
00:59:34.70 --> 00:59:35.70 dude who won.
00:59:35.70 --> 00:59:37.90 Nobody comes back and I wonder how I did on that one.
00:59:37.90 --> 00:59:38.90 It's all very evident.
00:59:38.90 --> 00:59:42.26 If you're looking over your shoulder and the guy is telling to these gunning you with his
00:59:42.26 --> 00:59:45.54 airplane, you don't go back to the debrief and think, I wonder how that, I wonder how this
00:59:45.54 --> 00:59:47.10 is going to play out.
00:59:47.10 --> 00:59:50.66 So it's all right there, laid out the cards are always in the table.
00:59:50.66 --> 00:59:53.42 There's a reason for everything while you succeeded in while you failed.
00:59:53.42 --> 00:59:58.22 And I just thrived in that environment because you couldn't hide from anything.
00:59:58.22 --> 01:00:00.14 Everybody saw everything and it was all right there.
01:00:00.14 --> 01:00:06.66 Who good student, a really good talented student coming up to Top Gun has what percentage
01:00:06.66 --> 01:00:07.62 chance of winning.
01:00:07.62 --> 01:00:13.54 So if the best, let's say the high-peter to the best student that I ever saw that came to
01:00:13.54 --> 01:00:18.50 Top Gun as a student from a squadron, the best student that ever came to Top Gun to fight
01:00:18.50 --> 01:00:23.30 a qualified Top Gun instructor stands 0% chance of winning.
01:00:23.30 --> 01:00:27.78 The best student at Top Gun has zero chance.
01:00:27.78 --> 01:00:31.30 I could fall asleep in an airplane as an IP and a student is not going to be me.
01:00:31.30 --> 01:00:35.54 There is just such a huge, and it doesn't even mean that we're better.
01:00:35.54 --> 01:00:39.02 I don't mean to imply that we were better pilots, but you're just, you're a hat time.
01:00:39.02 --> 01:00:40.02 Yep, it's just time.
01:00:40.02 --> 01:00:44.06 And it's not even me that critical.
01:00:44.06 --> 01:00:45.50 It's just not even close.
01:00:45.50 --> 01:00:47.50 And nor would they expect it.
01:00:47.50 --> 01:00:50.94 Some students, every now and then a student thinks he's going to do some good work and I
01:00:50.94 --> 01:00:52.66 watch this, I'm awesome.
01:00:52.66 --> 01:00:57.18 But most guys show up realizing that disparity, I understood that when I got there as a student,
01:00:57.18 --> 01:00:58.98 these guys are just in a different world.
01:00:58.98 --> 01:01:00.90 You want to get to that world.
01:01:00.90 --> 01:01:09.98 But as an IP, if I instructor, if I flew my best jet on day one against the best
01:01:09.98 --> 01:01:16.50 student, it would be over so fast that he almost wouldn't even learn as much as he should.
01:01:16.50 --> 01:01:21.98 So you, you still fly your best airplane, but you make sure that there's a learning process.
01:01:21.98 --> 01:01:26.30 There, if you want to just annihilate somebody at Top Gun, as you can do that, the students
01:01:26.30 --> 01:01:33.70 that come there, even on their last day aren't on your same level.
01:01:33.70 --> 01:01:34.70 They just aren't.
01:01:34.70 --> 01:01:36.66 They've gotten a lot better than learning curve as steep.
01:01:36.66 --> 01:01:40.74 But when you're in your third year as an IP at Top Gun, you've just had so many reps,
01:01:40.74 --> 01:01:42.66 so many laps doing the exact same thing.
01:01:42.66 --> 01:01:47.02 You've seen everything that it's almost like, we talked about this yesterday, it's almost
01:01:47.02 --> 01:01:48.82 like things are happening in the slow motion for you.
01:01:48.82 --> 01:01:51.78 You're in the matrix and that guy is just working as hard as he possibly can and doing
01:01:51.78 --> 01:01:52.78 his thing.
01:01:52.78 --> 01:01:56.62 And you're just kind of sitting there, kind of watching it at like one third speed.
01:01:56.62 --> 01:02:00.22 So you're ability to decide and do something to him or do something to that airplane or make
01:02:00.22 --> 01:02:02.02 a decision.
01:02:02.02 --> 01:02:04.30 You're just operating in a faster pace than him.
01:02:04.30 --> 01:02:06.34 And that reaction is just impossible to keep up with.
01:02:06.34 --> 01:02:11.14 I can't wait to start training Jiu Jitsu because you're just going to the analogies or just
01:02:11.14 --> 01:02:12.74 everywhere.
01:02:12.74 --> 01:02:15.18 And that's one thing I said, Jiu Jitsu, you can see the future.
01:02:15.18 --> 01:02:18.98 You can actually see the future when you're training Jiu Jitsu with someone that doesn't
01:02:18.98 --> 01:02:22.18 know as much as you, you know what is going to happen.
01:02:22.18 --> 01:02:24.02 You know what they are going to do.
01:02:24.02 --> 01:02:27.82 Just like when you're in the cockpit and you do something and you know what that person
01:02:27.82 --> 01:02:28.82 you know what they're going to do.
01:02:28.82 --> 01:02:30.22 You just know it totally.
01:02:30.22 --> 01:02:34.86 And don't forget too as an instructor, you've been on the receiving end of that for years
01:02:34.86 --> 01:02:35.86 as well.
01:02:35.86 --> 01:02:39.06 You're standing kind of both sides of that coin and you know you fly with someone and
01:02:39.06 --> 01:02:42.06 you'll think you're so like, oh, I can't believe you just did that.
01:02:42.06 --> 01:02:46.90 And then you know three turns later is when you get to take advantage of that because
01:02:46.90 --> 01:02:50.22 you know some time we'll have to play out for his mistake to really reveal itself like
01:02:50.22 --> 01:02:52.54 man, I can't believe you just did that.
01:02:52.54 --> 01:02:54.86 This is going to cost you over time.
01:02:54.86 --> 01:02:58.30 And you can go back on the tape like I said and say, hey, you know, you're worried about
01:02:58.30 --> 01:03:00.26 what happened at the end, run behind you.
01:03:00.26 --> 01:03:05.18 But what really, what let me do that was 30 seconds ago you did this.
01:03:05.18 --> 01:03:09.30 And when this was the environment or the circumstances and you see that stuff and that's
01:03:09.30 --> 01:03:12.34 when you talk about seeing the future, I mean, if you really want to be a jerk about it,
01:03:12.34 --> 01:03:15.66 you know, if guys of your buddies, you know, I'll get in the radio like a buddy of mine.
01:03:15.66 --> 01:03:18.98 I'll, students that came through but guys in my squash and like, oh, that's going to hurt.
01:03:18.98 --> 01:03:21.26 And they're like, what am I, I'm like, stand by.
01:03:21.26 --> 01:03:25.94 You know, in 30 seconds later you'll be gone in the guy because you see the mistakes
01:03:25.94 --> 01:03:29.06 that they make and you know how that's going to play out.
01:03:29.06 --> 01:03:33.94 So you are on your own playing field there as an instructor and like I said, man, it's
01:03:33.94 --> 01:03:36.54 not about being better or worse.
01:03:36.54 --> 01:03:41.78 It's just the time and you get so much of the time there and you get exposed to all the
01:03:41.78 --> 01:03:45.70 the why you get the why at top gun.
01:03:45.70 --> 01:03:50.98 We teach the why a lot but when you're writing the manual, when you're doing that and you
01:03:50.98 --> 01:03:55.26 have all the testing equipment available and you're running a thousand computer generator
01:03:55.26 --> 01:04:00.42 reps to see what the results are, the level of what you know about the why is just so much
01:04:00.42 --> 01:04:01.42 more.
01:04:01.42 --> 01:04:06.46 You just, there's a whole world available to you to and and the guys at top can too want
01:04:06.46 --> 01:04:07.46 to be there.
01:04:07.46 --> 01:04:10.46 The most that IPs are killing to get to a place like that.
01:04:10.46 --> 01:04:12.66 So there's not a lot of slackers there.
01:04:12.66 --> 01:04:16.10 Not a lot of dudes are trying to motivate or kind of prod along like, hey, buddy, let's
01:04:16.10 --> 01:04:20.82 get go, you know, dudes are getting after it from startup to shut down every single day.
01:04:20.82 --> 01:04:23.94 And so you're also getting pulled along because you want to keep up with your peers.
01:04:23.94 --> 01:04:27.30 You know, you don't want to be the worst top gun instructor there.
01:04:27.30 --> 01:04:30.46 You know, every time you think you've made it, you realize all you did is just getting
01:04:30.46 --> 01:04:34.10 more selective pool and your goal is the same as to be the best that you can be and hopefully
01:04:34.10 --> 01:04:35.94 the best you can be is one of the best guys there.
01:04:35.94 --> 01:04:39.78 You know, you don't want to be last at top gun because then you're just last and when we
01:04:39.78 --> 01:04:43.22 last and anything who does and so that's a real kind of a type of a real aggressive
01:04:43.22 --> 01:04:48.46 group of dudes and they pull you and you you got to keep up and sometimes you know, a couple
01:04:48.46 --> 01:04:52.70 guys here and they're done for for the most part the selection process works pretty well.
01:04:52.70 --> 01:04:57.58 You know, what's cool just to bring this back for a second to, you know, talking about
01:04:57.58 --> 01:04:59.50 leadership and interacting with other people.
01:04:59.50 --> 01:05:06.34 The same exact thing happens when you start to pay attention to the tactics, techniques,
01:05:06.34 --> 01:05:09.50 procedures of leadership.
01:05:09.50 --> 01:05:12.02 You start to see the moves that people are making.
01:05:12.02 --> 01:05:15.46 You know, you start to see the moves that your subordinate is making because his ego is
01:05:15.46 --> 01:05:21.10 flaring up or because he's getting, taking too much ownership of something that he doesn't
01:05:21.10 --> 01:05:22.74 want to let go and he's getting emotional about it.
01:05:22.74 --> 01:05:29.18 You start seeing the same type of things at one third speed.
01:05:29.18 --> 01:05:34.02 You know, that was great for me when I was running the West Coast Seal Team training.
01:05:34.02 --> 01:05:35.66 That's all we take a platoon.
01:05:35.66 --> 01:05:41.78 We had these scenarios and we put up a tune through, we put another platoon through, we put
01:05:41.78 --> 01:05:44.30 another platoon through, we just over to the same scenario.
01:05:44.30 --> 01:05:48.54 Guy here, shoot her over here, person on this hilltop, hostage in this room.
01:05:48.54 --> 01:05:52.78 We put all these guys through the same scenario and so as soon as you approach, as soon
01:05:52.78 --> 01:05:56.94 as you watch him approach and you say, oh, the platoon commander's too far in the rear.
01:05:56.94 --> 01:05:59.94 So what's going to happen?
01:05:59.94 --> 01:05:59.94 He's not going to see what's coming up front up.
01:05:59.94 --> 01:06:00.94 Yep, there it is.
01:06:00.94 --> 01:06:01.94 And so you just know what's going to happen.
01:06:01.94 --> 01:06:03.26 And it's the same thing when you start dealing with their personalities.
01:06:03.26 --> 01:06:06.54 You get a guy with a big ego that comes in and he wants to run everything his way and he thinks
01:06:06.54 --> 01:06:08.62 he's going to be able to control everything and you're like, no, he's not going to be able
01:06:08.62 --> 01:06:09.62 to do this.
01:06:09.62 --> 01:06:13.50 So you can end up and I see that in the business world, obviously now too, where you get the
01:06:13.50 --> 01:06:19.02 same exact problems of a guy that's too emotional about his plan or has too big of an ego
01:06:19.02 --> 01:06:22.82 about something or he's not passing the word well enough for the, he's trying to control
01:06:22.82 --> 01:06:24.50 everyone and not using decentralized commitment.
01:06:24.50 --> 01:06:28.62 It's so obvious because you have the reps.
01:06:28.62 --> 01:06:35.42 We have the reps now in this arena to be to look at a situation and say, okay, let me
01:06:35.42 --> 01:06:36.42 watch this.
01:06:36.42 --> 01:06:38.38 Oh, oh, okay, I see what's about to happen.
01:06:38.38 --> 01:06:39.38 Here's what's going on.
01:06:39.38 --> 01:06:40.38 We can break it down.
01:06:40.38 --> 01:06:41.70 So it's the same thing across the board.
01:06:41.70 --> 01:06:47.18 You get that level of just experience and repetitions and repetitions.
01:06:47.18 --> 01:06:51.02 And now you can kind of see the future and you can predict what's going to happen.
01:06:51.02 --> 01:06:54.18 And then the good thing is in the business world, when you can predict what's going to happen,
01:06:54.18 --> 01:06:55.18 you can stop it.
01:06:55.18 --> 01:06:58.18 You can get the people on the right track, pull them back in and get them arranged.
01:06:58.18 --> 01:07:02.18 Well, I think the thing that a lot of people don't realize because sometimes they think
01:07:02.18 --> 01:07:04.62 it's just different in the military.
01:07:04.62 --> 01:07:09.02 The reasons why people are successful in the military and the reasons why people fail are
01:07:09.02 --> 01:07:13.66 exactly the same as why you succeed in business and why you succeed as a person or why
01:07:13.66 --> 01:07:14.66 you fail.
01:07:14.66 --> 01:07:16.50 Now look, I know, you know, being an airplane is different.
01:07:16.50 --> 01:07:17.50 I get that.
01:07:17.50 --> 01:07:19.42 The environment might be a little bit different being combat certainly.
01:07:19.42 --> 01:07:22.14 So the setting changes in all these things, the setting is different.
01:07:22.14 --> 01:07:25.62 But the reasons are exactly the same.
01:07:25.62 --> 01:07:28.82 And so to dispel whatever myth, you know, it's different in the military.
01:07:28.82 --> 01:07:29.82 It's identical in the military.
01:07:29.82 --> 01:07:30.82 No, no, no.
01:07:30.82 --> 01:07:34.74 It comes out in an airplane or it comes out on a ship or whatever it comes out in downtown
01:07:34.74 --> 01:07:35.74 Ramadhi.
01:07:35.74 --> 01:07:36.74 The setting?
01:07:36.74 --> 01:07:38.14 Yeah, it's different.
01:07:38.14 --> 01:07:39.42 But what's going on?
01:07:39.42 --> 01:07:41.46 It's identical.
01:07:41.46 --> 01:07:45.94 And when you get to, when you get to being a place where you get to devote 100% of your time
01:07:45.94 --> 01:07:51.18 to that and you're not distracted by just the distracts of military bureaucracy and life
01:07:51.18 --> 01:07:56.54 of training schedules and did everybody do their annual survey.
01:07:56.54 --> 01:08:00.58 When you're away from that and you're living in a world who's being tactical and doing nothing
01:08:00.58 --> 01:08:04.78 but learning about how to be the best part you can be in the best teacher.
01:08:04.78 --> 01:08:08.78 Everything, not just being a fighter about everything in the world slows down.
01:08:08.78 --> 01:08:10.58 Everything slows down.
01:08:10.58 --> 01:08:15.74 And I think it just gives you a perspective on life that, top God, I will carry those
01:08:15.74 --> 01:08:16.74 lessons.
01:08:16.74 --> 01:08:20.58 I mean, obviously, I care that with me and everything that I do and I will forever.
01:08:20.58 --> 01:08:24.30 You know, what was honed at a place like that and in some ways in the military, it's just
01:08:24.30 --> 01:08:27.66 a luxury because it's just not that common to have someone say for three years, you're
01:08:27.66 --> 01:08:29.34 just going to do nothing but this.
01:08:29.34 --> 01:08:30.34 What, dude?
01:08:30.34 --> 01:08:31.34 Are you kidding me?
01:08:31.34 --> 01:08:36.34 So, so speaking of decision making and good and or bad decision making.
01:08:36.34 --> 01:08:41.50 So you're living the dream, you're up in Fallon, you actually have a house up in the mountains,
01:08:41.50 --> 01:08:45.70 you're skiing, flying, everything's good.
01:08:45.70 --> 01:08:49.98 And then somehow you make a decision that's a little bit off the track a little bit.
01:08:49.98 --> 01:08:50.98 What was that all about?
01:08:50.98 --> 01:08:51.98 I don't know.
01:08:51.98 --> 01:08:53.50 I'm going to talk about it.
01:08:53.50 --> 01:08:57.30 So yeah, I am, I'm in my third year at Top Gun, 2005.
01:08:57.30 --> 01:08:58.90 I was selected be the training officer.
01:08:58.90 --> 01:09:05.42 So I am running Top Gun as the senior IP there, which is just, it's awesome.
01:09:05.42 --> 01:09:08.74 It's a, it is literally, as a Marine, it's a dream job.
01:09:08.74 --> 01:09:10.94 You could not ask for anything better.
01:09:10.94 --> 01:09:14.86 I was dating what ended becoming my wife.
01:09:14.86 --> 01:09:17.22 So my wife Whitney at the time we're dating, so it lives out there.
01:09:17.22 --> 01:09:22.98 We had a place in Tahoe, drove a Corvette, my life was pretty good, man.
01:09:22.98 --> 01:09:26.26 And I'm actually coming up on my end of service obligation.
01:09:26.26 --> 01:09:28.86 I can leave the Marine Corps in 2005.
01:09:28.86 --> 01:09:33.74 And I sort of sold my relationship to Whitney on that idea.
01:09:33.74 --> 01:09:37.18 Like, hey, come put up with this, live in a Tahoe, but I'm going to get out of the Marine
01:09:37.18 --> 01:09:38.98 Corps and don't worry about this.
01:09:38.98 --> 01:09:41.22 None of this is all, it's all come, don't worry about that.
01:09:41.22 --> 01:09:42.22 Defondments war, it's over.
01:09:42.22 --> 01:09:44.66 You don't need to worry about that.
01:09:44.66 --> 01:09:50.30 So I think I oversold that to her a little bit, got her to move out to Tahoe.
01:09:50.30 --> 01:09:57.90 And so there was just a part of me that didn't feel done with the Marine Corps.
01:09:57.90 --> 01:10:03.24 And ironically, in this amazing experience that I had built up in my mind since I was 16 years
01:10:03.24 --> 01:10:05.26 old, I'm now a Top Gun instructor.
01:10:05.26 --> 01:10:10.02 I joined the Marine Corps knowing, as a fortunately, Top Gun was this big influence.
01:10:10.02 --> 01:10:11.94 I'm going to leave the Marine Corps as a Top Gun instructor.
01:10:11.94 --> 01:10:19.06 But I had spent four years flying F-18s off carriers, basically in the Navy for the
01:10:19.06 --> 01:10:20.06 Frol and Tenset purposes.
01:10:20.06 --> 01:10:22.78 And I was a Marine in the Marine Squadron, but we deployed with Navy carriers.
01:10:22.78 --> 01:10:27.26 And I spent three years in Fallon on a Navy base with a Navy command.
01:10:27.26 --> 01:10:32.10 It was one of three pilots on the Staff at Top Gun.
01:10:32.10 --> 01:10:35.50 And there was just a part of me that I knew I was going to be done.
01:10:35.50 --> 01:10:38.94 I was ready to leave the Marine Corps, but I wanted to leave the Marine Corps having
01:10:38.94 --> 01:10:39.94 fulfilled.
01:10:39.94 --> 01:10:44.78 That part of being a Marine, a real Marine, is kind of how I felt.
01:10:44.78 --> 01:10:51.06 And so, again, I had kind of contemplated what I was going to do.
01:10:51.06 --> 01:10:52.38 You talked to somebody called your monitor.
01:10:52.38 --> 01:10:53.38 He's the guy that gives you orders.
01:10:53.38 --> 01:10:54.98 Hey, this is what's next in your career.
01:10:54.98 --> 01:10:58.18 This is where you're going to go for how long we think you should do this because it's
01:10:58.18 --> 01:10:59.18 helpful for whatever.
01:10:59.18 --> 01:11:03.70 The kind of explains it to you as a guy that basically is responsible for your career progression.
01:11:03.70 --> 01:11:05.42 And I was kind of going back and forth with what do I do?
01:11:05.42 --> 01:11:06.70 Do I stay into I get out?
01:11:06.70 --> 01:11:10.06 And I kind of was struggling with that decision.
01:11:10.06 --> 01:11:13.90 And he's like, look, we're going to, as a top instructor, you've got a lot of skill,
01:11:13.90 --> 01:11:17.56 we've got a lot of experience, and then want you to use that and bring it back to the
01:11:17.56 --> 01:11:20.22 Marine Corps and go to a squadron and teach these guys.
01:11:20.22 --> 01:11:22.18 So, he gave me orders.
01:11:22.18 --> 01:11:24.06 It says your order is going to be to go into Japan.
01:11:24.06 --> 01:11:29.58 You're going to fly a f-a-tines back to the regular fleet squadron and you'll go from there.
01:11:29.58 --> 01:11:32.46 And I even, I think I even got the point right out, orders given to me.
01:11:32.46 --> 01:11:33.94 Would you be in like a squadron commander?
01:11:33.94 --> 01:11:34.94 Or else?
01:11:34.94 --> 01:11:35.94 No, I would have been.
01:11:35.94 --> 01:11:36.94 The officer of Maine, it's officer.
01:11:36.94 --> 01:11:37.94 I was too junior.
01:11:37.94 --> 01:11:39.94 I'd only been in, I was like 10 years old.
01:11:39.94 --> 01:11:40.94 You know, 11 years more.
01:11:40.94 --> 01:11:43.90 So, I'm kind of what's called, we call it a department head, where I'm going to run a major
01:11:43.90 --> 01:11:44.90 department in the squadron.
01:11:44.90 --> 01:11:45.90 It was operations or Maine.
01:11:45.90 --> 01:11:48.50 It took kind of the two big ones.
01:11:48.50 --> 01:11:54.78 And I just didn't, it's not what I wanted to do.
01:11:54.78 --> 01:11:56.90 I had, like I said, some long-term plans to do another stuff.
01:11:56.90 --> 01:11:59.86 I was thinking, long-term I was going to get out and go do something else.
01:11:59.86 --> 01:12:01.10 And so, I called them on her.
01:12:01.10 --> 01:12:04.10 I said, hey, I want to do a factor.
01:12:04.10 --> 01:12:08.10 A factor is that four-dark controllers, like you described earlier on the podcast.
01:12:08.10 --> 01:12:11.14 And we had this little list on the internet that was called a hot fill list.
01:12:11.14 --> 01:12:13.26 It was basically all the jobs that nobody wanted.
01:12:13.26 --> 01:12:15.06 And if you called, it was a first come first serve.
01:12:15.06 --> 01:12:16.34 You called and volunteer for anything.
01:12:16.34 --> 01:12:18.70 You were automatically going to get it.
01:12:18.70 --> 01:12:21.50 And because it was just a list of jobs that they couldn't, like, force on guys or whatever
01:12:21.50 --> 01:12:22.98 reason I'm trying not to explain it all that well.
01:12:22.98 --> 01:12:25.10 But the bottom line is the hot fill bill it is.
01:12:25.10 --> 01:12:27.42 You call it yours for any reason.
01:12:27.42 --> 01:12:31.74 And I'm like, hey, man, I see this a hot fill to be a four-dark controller in Japan.
01:12:31.74 --> 01:12:35.30 Because I was going to go to Japan, we kind of cross that bridge of, okay, we're going to move overseas.
01:12:35.30 --> 01:12:36.30 We didn't have any kids.
01:12:36.30 --> 01:12:37.30 This is with Whitney.
01:12:37.30 --> 01:12:38.30 This is with Whitney.
01:12:38.30 --> 01:12:41.82 She's a little bit not super cool with it, but we found it will go to Japan.
01:12:41.82 --> 01:12:42.82 We'll fly.
01:12:42.82 --> 01:12:43.82 It'll be fine.
01:12:43.82 --> 01:12:47.58 And he's like, you're not going to be a four-dark controller in Japan.
01:12:47.58 --> 01:12:50.30 You're going to go fly and when I said dude, it's right there in black and white man.
01:12:50.30 --> 01:12:51.30 It says hot fill.
01:12:51.30 --> 01:12:53.30 I'm your guy.
01:12:53.30 --> 01:12:56.62 And he was like, okay, yeah, I mean, he and so he gave me these orders.
01:12:56.62 --> 01:13:00.06 And I wanted to be a factor.
01:13:00.06 --> 01:13:04.50 Because I wanted to leave the Marine Corps having fulfilled all the parts about being a Marine.
01:13:04.50 --> 01:13:07.82 And in my mind, it's funny because it's like we're opposite on that.
01:13:07.82 --> 01:13:11.90 The real challenge or the thing I didn't really want to do, but I knew I should was getting
01:13:11.90 --> 01:13:14.94 out of the airplane and doing something really hard in the ground.
01:13:14.94 --> 01:13:19.06 Like, my natural state in the Marine Corps is in an airplane.
01:13:19.06 --> 01:13:21.74 And for some people, they're miserable and I don't want to do it for me.
01:13:21.74 --> 01:13:25.74 That was, so to do that was to be a four-dark controller was.
01:13:25.74 --> 01:13:27.70 And it's strange to hear myself say it.
01:13:27.70 --> 01:13:31.82 I didn't want to go be a four-dark controller, but I knew I needed to go do that.
01:13:31.82 --> 01:13:36.22 There's no, I needed to leave the Marine Corps and say, yeah, I did that too.
01:13:36.22 --> 01:13:40.38 And it was just a matter of a fulfillment of kind of an exclamation point on the career that
01:13:40.38 --> 01:13:42.62 I always kind of fantasize him as I learned more about the Marine Corps.
01:13:42.62 --> 01:13:44.38 There was more to it than just being a pilot.
01:13:44.38 --> 01:13:45.38 Right.
01:13:45.38 --> 01:13:49.30 So, so in your mind, were you thinking four-dark controller in Japan, met you're going to go
01:13:49.30 --> 01:13:51.34 over there, you know, have a little team of Marines.
01:13:51.34 --> 01:13:56.02 You'd go out to the different training ranges, call for some bombs, all good.
01:13:56.02 --> 01:13:58.78 You know, go home at night, be with your wife.
01:13:58.78 --> 01:13:59.78 Might even go.
01:13:59.78 --> 01:14:00.78 Just in Japan.
01:14:00.78 --> 01:14:04.62 Just in just nice little, sort of like a long vacation, working a little bit of time
01:14:04.62 --> 01:14:05.62 on the ground.
01:14:05.62 --> 01:14:06.62 I get to go to the field.
01:14:06.62 --> 01:14:07.62 I spend the night in the woods.
01:14:07.62 --> 01:14:08.62 Yeah, something like that.
01:14:08.62 --> 01:14:09.62 You know, yeah.
01:14:09.62 --> 01:14:10.62 It's really cool camping.
01:14:10.62 --> 01:14:11.62 And they pay for it.
01:14:11.62 --> 01:14:12.62 Yeah.
01:14:12.62 --> 01:14:13.62 So, yeah, that's what it was.
01:14:13.62 --> 01:14:14.62 I was going to go to Japan.
01:14:14.62 --> 01:14:16.90 There's a bunch of really cool, it was going to be in Okinawa actually.
01:14:16.90 --> 01:14:17.90 So, not mainland Japan.
01:14:17.90 --> 01:14:19.30 Okinawa's got great scuba diving.
01:14:19.30 --> 01:14:20.30 It's kind of neat.
01:14:20.30 --> 01:14:22.10 And, you know, I could bring my wife with me.
01:14:22.10 --> 01:14:24.14 It was going to be a lot of fun.
01:14:24.14 --> 01:14:28.06 And I was going to teach guys how to use airplanes or drop bombs.
01:14:28.06 --> 01:14:29.06 I knew how to do that.
01:14:29.06 --> 01:14:31.18 I was going to be a really cool thing.
01:14:31.18 --> 01:14:32.90 So, I get these orders.
01:14:32.90 --> 01:14:35.74 And my wife and I moved out to Japan.
01:14:35.74 --> 01:14:36.74 We got there.
01:14:36.74 --> 01:14:40.74 And to Okinawa, I placed called Camp Pants in a little base up there in the middle of the island.
01:14:40.74 --> 01:14:45.34 And I'm there probably.
01:14:45.34 --> 01:14:47.02 Dude, I'm probably there a week.
01:14:47.02 --> 01:14:52.22 And my boss, the brigade, the two commander, is like, hey, we're going to send a brigade
01:14:52.22 --> 01:14:54.10 of platoon, which is probably 50 guys.
01:14:54.10 --> 01:14:56.46 I'm guessing at the numbers.
01:14:56.46 --> 01:14:57.86 To Camp Pants Jun.
01:14:57.86 --> 01:15:01.38 Because that angle just came back from seven months in Iraq.
01:15:01.38 --> 01:15:03.54 And they need to go right back and turn to very quick turn around.
01:15:03.54 --> 01:15:06.54 They don't have enough qualified guys.
01:15:06.54 --> 01:15:10.78 And so, I mean, I'm there a week and I'm coming home to tell Whitney like, hey, here's
01:15:10.78 --> 01:15:12.50 the deal.
01:15:12.50 --> 01:15:15.42 They need guys to go out to the Jun to do this deployment to Iraq.
01:15:15.42 --> 01:15:17.34 And I'm going to be one of those guys.
01:15:17.34 --> 01:15:20.54 So we were there instead of a year we were there for maybe.
01:15:20.54 --> 01:15:23.54 She was like, is there snorkeling in Iraq?
01:15:23.54 --> 01:15:27.42 Because you were telling me about scuba diving.
01:15:27.42 --> 01:15:31.22 So we crammed a year's worth of stuff in about six weeks.
01:15:31.22 --> 01:15:36.86 Because we had, so it was probably maybe early November when we kind of came down.
01:15:36.86 --> 01:15:38.42 And we had to the end of the counter year.
01:15:38.42 --> 01:15:43.30 So we shoved a year's worth of living in Japan in about six weeks.
01:15:43.30 --> 01:15:47.86 And we did Korea, we did Thailand, we did mainland, Tokyo, we did got her dog call.
01:15:47.86 --> 01:15:53.10 I mean, we did it all only December 22nd or whatever it was, you know, we flew home.
01:15:53.10 --> 01:15:59.06 And I went straight to the Jun from there to start training with second Anglico, which was the
01:15:59.06 --> 01:16:01.90 team that had just come back from Iraq after there's seven months appointment.
01:16:01.90 --> 01:16:03.50 And I'm on a very quick turn.
01:16:03.50 --> 01:16:04.90 They're probably four months into their turn on.
01:16:04.90 --> 01:16:07.38 So you get just real quick for people that don't know what Anglico is.
01:16:07.38 --> 01:16:09.18 Yeah, please.
01:16:09.18 --> 01:16:14.94 The Anglico stands for Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company.
01:16:14.94 --> 01:16:20.42 And really what it is, it's a group of small teams, four or five man teams called Fire
01:16:20.42 --> 01:16:21.42 Power Control teams.
01:16:21.42 --> 01:16:26.34 And what those teams were all supposed to be able to do is control airplanes, tell airplanes
01:16:26.34 --> 01:16:28.70 what to do with their bombs.
01:16:28.70 --> 01:16:31.70 We could control artillery, so how to fire artillery ordinance.
01:16:31.70 --> 01:16:35.22 And even we didn't do it there on Iraq, but we could use Naval Gunfire.
01:16:35.22 --> 01:16:38.14 So guns off ships, we were training all three of those skill sets.
01:16:38.14 --> 01:16:43.70 And the whole point of an Anglico and a place like Iraq is you had different units, you
01:16:43.70 --> 01:16:47.38 had Navy units, Army units, Marine Corps units, and as an Anglico, you're really a zone.
01:16:47.38 --> 01:16:48.98 So that's what the L and Anglico is.
01:16:48.98 --> 01:16:54.22 So I was trying to go to an Army unit and know how Army does people may not know this.
01:16:54.22 --> 01:16:56.70 All the surface is actually do the same job differently.
01:16:56.70 --> 01:16:59.82 So the Army and the Marine Corps will get the same mission and have a totally different way
01:16:59.82 --> 01:17:01.82 of doing it because their doctrine they're training is different.
01:17:01.82 --> 01:17:05.46 Now it's similar, but there's a bunch of pretty critical differences in there.
01:17:05.46 --> 01:17:09.74 And so what we were training to do is we had all marine airplanes in where we were on Iraq
01:17:09.74 --> 01:17:11.74 and all Army land forces.
01:17:11.74 --> 01:17:14.46 So the Army doesn't have any training, how to use Marine Corps airplanes.
01:17:14.46 --> 01:17:17.78 Marine Corps does have a lot of training to use Army ground forces.
01:17:17.78 --> 01:17:21.18 So when those two people connect, there's a problem with how they communicate and what they
01:17:21.18 --> 01:17:22.54 want from each other.
01:17:22.54 --> 01:17:27.12 Insert Anglico, where the liaison between the Army ground units and in this case the Marine
01:17:27.12 --> 01:17:28.62 Corps air units.
01:17:28.62 --> 01:17:32.34 So my job was to control Marine airplanes to support the Army on the ground.
01:17:32.34 --> 01:17:37.30 And that was all over Iraq and what the Anglico team would take this whole group and break
01:17:37.30 --> 01:17:43.74 it into maybe 25 four-man teams and went all over the country to go do this same mission
01:17:43.74 --> 01:17:45.34 with a whole bunch of different units.
01:17:45.34 --> 01:17:47.86 So that was our mission as a four-dayer controller.
01:17:47.86 --> 01:17:51.10 And I was qualified as a four-dayer controller because I had flown airplanes, job bombs
01:17:51.10 --> 01:17:54.34 and combat understood how F-A teams were supposed to support ground maneuver and I went
01:17:54.34 --> 01:17:56.26 to school with four-dayer controller school.
01:17:56.26 --> 01:17:57.26 So let's go to Japan.
01:17:57.26 --> 01:18:00.82 It'll be fun for pretend to do that for a year.
01:18:00.82 --> 01:18:06.94 And then we had up in Camp Lajoon training to go to Iraq.
01:18:06.94 --> 01:18:10.86 And now it's your first time doing grunt work.
01:18:10.86 --> 01:18:17.18 So last time I had a held a rifle, shot a rifle, and worn a pair of combat boots was
01:18:17.18 --> 01:18:19.02 the basic school.
01:18:19.02 --> 01:18:23.98 So I had, you know, I got my air slotted at TBS.
01:18:23.98 --> 01:18:25.58 That was a big day for me.
01:18:25.58 --> 01:18:26.86 You know, I had done six months of that.
01:18:26.86 --> 01:18:27.86 I had that check in the block.
01:18:27.86 --> 01:18:29.14 I was feeling pretty good about that.
01:18:29.14 --> 01:18:33.26 And I had never, I don't think I put on my camey, my camey-mathalized uniform.
01:18:33.26 --> 01:18:35.58 I think I wore a flight suit.
01:18:35.58 --> 01:18:38.06 Honestly, I think every day for seven years.
01:18:38.06 --> 01:18:40.22 I could probably count on one hand.
01:18:40.22 --> 01:18:41.94 Well, even longer than that, I was even counting flight school.
01:18:41.94 --> 01:18:46.78 I could probably count on one hand the number of days that I didn't wear a flight
01:18:46.78 --> 01:18:50.38 suit from the time that I selected to go to flight school to the time that I ended up in
01:18:50.38 --> 01:18:51.38 Anglico.
01:18:51.38 --> 01:18:52.38 Days.
01:18:52.38 --> 01:18:54.86 I mean, so this was a foreign.
01:18:54.86 --> 01:18:57.02 Now, I had, I was in Marine.
01:18:57.02 --> 01:19:01.02 I went through the basic schools all back there somewhere.
01:19:01.02 --> 01:19:06.30 But I think there is this, and I've mentioned this, I think, to you, I think it's just
01:19:06.30 --> 01:19:08.26 sort of this habit of self-sabotage.
01:19:08.26 --> 01:19:12.26 Like, well, I can't leave the Marine Corps that being a real Marine.
01:19:12.26 --> 01:19:15.82 So I'm going to literally sabotage myself by volunteering for a job that I don't know if
01:19:15.82 --> 01:19:18.46 I really want to do, but now I'm stuck doing it.
01:19:18.46 --> 01:19:19.46 So I'm going to have to do that.
01:19:19.46 --> 01:19:22.62 So I won't ever have to say, I didn't do that.
01:19:22.62 --> 01:19:27.78 So this kind of cycle of breaking promises to my wife volunteering for stuff.
01:19:27.78 --> 01:19:29.38 I didn't really want to do but knew that I should.
01:19:29.38 --> 01:19:33.06 And next thing I know, it all blew up in my face because I was going to Japan.
01:19:33.06 --> 01:19:34.78 That Japan's awesome.
01:19:34.78 --> 01:19:38.26 Good sushi and great experience there and it's going to be awesome and I will be a
01:19:38.26 --> 01:19:40.90 fact and I can, for the rest of my life, say, oh, I was a rumor.
01:19:40.90 --> 01:19:43.94 I was a fact and I did all that.
01:19:43.94 --> 01:19:45.58 And, you know, it's January and campus.
01:19:45.58 --> 01:19:46.58 It's really what it is for.
01:19:46.58 --> 01:19:47.58 Yeah, it's for.
01:19:47.58 --> 01:19:48.78 Holy man.
01:19:48.78 --> 01:19:50.58 So, yeah, make no mistake.
01:19:50.58 --> 01:19:56.50 I mean, I did that, I volunteered, but I did not at the time when I was trading in my flying
01:19:56.50 --> 01:19:57.98 orders for these fact orders.
01:19:57.98 --> 01:20:01.30 I didn't expect to be in a body.
01:20:01.30 --> 01:20:06.90 But as, hey, we need to send an uppercatable tune to campus unit prep those guys to
01:20:06.90 --> 01:20:07.90 course.
01:20:07.90 --> 01:20:08.90 Yep, I'm going.
01:20:08.90 --> 01:20:09.90 I'm not going to not go.
01:20:09.90 --> 01:20:10.90 That's what we need to do.
01:20:10.90 --> 01:20:11.90 We're going to go do that.
01:20:11.90 --> 01:20:15.54 When I got to campus unit, I ended up being the senior, just by rank, the senior
01:20:15.54 --> 01:20:17.30 four-year control room in the unit.
01:20:17.30 --> 01:20:21.14 I was kind of a middle-level major, I, you know, come from top going.
01:20:21.14 --> 01:20:23.82 I came straight from top going to that and I was an experienced guy in the community
01:20:23.82 --> 01:20:24.82 officer, no joke.
01:20:24.82 --> 01:20:28.90 I picked her the day, walks in one day and he hands me a piece of paper and it's got like
01:20:28.90 --> 01:20:31.78 26 lines on it, one for every team.
01:20:31.78 --> 01:20:35.70 And on the other sheet was all the locations that we were going to go to.
01:20:35.70 --> 01:20:38.46 And he's like fill out, we're all the teams are going because we got to cover these
01:20:38.46 --> 01:20:42.34 15 different locations, you know, one to two teams per location and just write the number
01:20:42.34 --> 01:20:44.54 of the team on there and get this back and move up close to business.
01:20:44.54 --> 01:20:45.54 Like Roger, that's her.
01:20:45.54 --> 01:20:47.38 I think her.
01:20:47.38 --> 01:20:53.06 And again, my wife loves the story and I didn't tell her at the time, but my best friend
01:20:53.06 --> 01:20:55.82 who I grew up with was in Ramadi at the time.
01:20:55.82 --> 01:21:00.46 He was in third-time, seventh-marine, so we replaced when we got out there or did a turnover
01:21:00.46 --> 01:21:02.06 with.
01:21:02.06 --> 01:21:04.94 And that's where the war was, man.
01:21:04.94 --> 01:21:09.54 I mean, in late 2005 and in early 2006, the war was in Ramadi.
01:21:09.54 --> 01:21:14.66 And so I took the then, I wrote Lightning 6 and so 6162 and 6-3, we're all going
01:21:14.66 --> 01:21:17.38 in Ramadi and I handed it off to every field of that, gave it to the CO.
01:21:17.38 --> 01:21:24.02 So if you're going to go do something you don't necessarily want to do, but you're going
01:21:24.02 --> 01:21:25.70 to go do it, you might as well do it.
01:21:25.70 --> 01:21:27.74 And that's where the war was.
01:21:27.74 --> 01:21:30.50 I could have gone to a whole host of other places where there's not much going on, it
01:21:30.50 --> 01:21:32.30 would have been relatively chill.
01:21:32.30 --> 01:21:34.18 I would have gotten that check in the block for sure.
01:21:34.18 --> 01:21:39.10 I would have said, yeah, I went to a hero there and no hit on the guys in a different
01:21:39.10 --> 01:21:42.34 place is just more going on there.
01:21:42.34 --> 01:21:44.34 And if I wasn't going to go, then somebody else is going to go do that.
01:21:44.34 --> 01:21:47.54 So it was Neil Neil was telling you what was up he said, hey, it's on.
01:21:47.54 --> 01:21:48.54 Big time.
01:21:48.54 --> 01:21:51.34 No, he and I were tight and we talked as regular as we could as much as we can say.
01:21:51.34 --> 01:21:54.64 Oh, you're listening to you telling you like, oh, yeah, I was putting rounds on shooting
01:21:54.64 --> 01:21:56.58 yesterday and you said, well, what were you shooting at?
01:21:56.58 --> 01:21:58.22 And he's like, people.
01:21:58.22 --> 01:22:02.14 Yeah, I was just, it was such a foreign thing to me as a pilot, certainly coming from
01:22:02.14 --> 01:22:03.14 top.
01:22:03.14 --> 01:22:04.14 And this is my best friend too.
01:22:04.14 --> 01:22:06.14 And our whole life, we both wanted to be in Ramadi.
01:22:06.14 --> 01:22:08.66 We never, we were in the same unit together.
01:22:08.66 --> 01:22:10.66 We just couldn't get aligned with that.
01:22:10.66 --> 01:22:13.74 It never occurred to me when we were kids dreaming about being in Ramadi or Firepotset.
01:22:13.74 --> 01:22:17.50 The only time we'd ever served together was in Ramadi as Fort Controlers.
01:22:17.50 --> 01:22:19.14 I healed with some of this podcast.
01:22:19.14 --> 01:22:20.54 He'll get a good chuckle out of this.
01:22:20.54 --> 01:22:22.78 But so he was there for the seven months prior.
01:22:22.78 --> 01:22:27.68 So I think the, you know, maybe June or July of that year when I was getting ready to get
01:22:27.68 --> 01:22:30.66 orders, he was on his factory.
01:22:30.66 --> 01:22:32.50 And he was just a baton, a baton, a baton, three seven.
01:22:32.50 --> 01:22:34.90 You know, OP293 OP, he would be here with you guys.
01:22:34.90 --> 01:22:36.06 It's just doing the deed man.
01:22:36.06 --> 01:22:41.70 I'm getting out of big time and struggling, this a lot going on there.
01:22:41.70 --> 01:22:46.46 And when he would tell me this story is even someone who had been a Marine for that long,
01:22:46.46 --> 01:22:47.66 he's like, yeah, we're in a firefight.
01:22:47.66 --> 01:22:49.46 I'm like, are you shooting your rifle?
01:22:49.46 --> 01:22:50.46 Is that yeah, man?
01:22:50.46 --> 01:22:51.46 I get what?
01:22:51.46 --> 01:22:55.30 The people that are shooting in me, it's just, it's, it's, it's, you're disconnected.
01:22:55.30 --> 01:22:58.62 And you have this, you don't have this sense of what that means.
01:22:58.62 --> 01:23:02.66 And so even as I was processing what he was saying and trying to understand and then
01:23:02.66 --> 01:23:06.02 saying, I, this is where the, this is what I'm going to go do and kind of volunteering
01:23:06.02 --> 01:23:07.02 to go do that.
01:23:07.02 --> 01:23:08.02 I'll be honest with you.
01:23:08.02 --> 01:23:12.42 I mean, there's still a part in retrospect that just didn't really quite fully grasp
01:23:12.42 --> 01:23:13.26 what that meant.
01:23:13.26 --> 01:23:17.82 I don't know how anybody on the first deployment to a place like a Romadi goes
01:23:17.82 --> 01:23:18.82 into that.
01:23:18.82 --> 01:23:21.06 You know, I dabble to aviation, like you said, I'm up in the sky.
01:23:21.06 --> 01:23:23.26 I mean, it's relatively safe.
01:23:23.26 --> 01:23:26.50 And I'm sure even the first deployment you did, there's just, there's an element of
01:23:26.50 --> 01:23:28.70 just not being able to fully understand it.
01:23:28.70 --> 01:23:32.30 And that didn't even become clear to me until right when we're getting ready to leave
01:23:32.30 --> 01:23:35.66 from a body and the new units coming in and I was explaining what they're about to get
01:23:35.66 --> 01:23:36.66 into.
01:23:36.66 --> 01:23:39.62 They hit me and I just rewind myself a year earlier.
01:23:39.62 --> 01:23:42.34 I'm like, I'm that dude that really doesn't know what the hell's about to happen to
01:23:42.34 --> 01:23:44.86 him and what's about to go on.
01:23:44.86 --> 01:23:50.02 But it was like I said, man, I don't even want to make it sound like that big of a deal.
01:23:50.02 --> 01:23:52.74 But I've all in here for a fact to her.
01:23:52.74 --> 01:23:54.78 They need to guys to go to the gym to go to Iraq.
01:23:54.78 --> 01:23:56.06 That's where Romadi was where the fight was.
01:23:56.06 --> 01:23:57.22 My best friend was there.
01:23:57.22 --> 01:23:58.22 I'm going to Romadi.
01:23:58.22 --> 01:23:59.22 Yeah.
01:23:59.22 --> 01:24:00.22 And that was about it.
01:24:00.22 --> 01:24:00.98 It was just, that's where I thought I should do.
01:24:00.98 --> 01:24:03.02 So I went to Romadi.
01:24:03.02 --> 01:24:04.86 And now you're leading Marines too.
01:24:04.86 --> 01:24:05.86 Yeah.
01:24:05.86 --> 01:24:14.06 And yes, so I explained just a minute ago about those things that may be successful and
01:24:14.06 --> 01:24:16.66 things that lead to failure are identical.
01:24:16.66 --> 01:24:19.86 They are the exact same things in an airplane or the same on the ground.
01:24:19.86 --> 01:24:23.18 But the environment is different.
01:24:23.18 --> 01:24:24.18 It is different.
01:24:24.18 --> 01:24:26.06 There's no way around it.
01:24:26.06 --> 01:24:30.94 And I also would say too that and for good reason, I think the ground Marines, you know,
01:24:30.94 --> 01:24:33.10 I worked a lot of infantry in artillery.
01:24:33.10 --> 01:24:36.50 Most of Anglican was made up of artillery and cemetery, not, and you know, obviously there's
01:24:36.50 --> 01:24:38.78 pilots that are controllers.
01:24:38.78 --> 01:24:43.94 There's a decent bit of skepticism of pilots coming in to lead these teams.
01:24:43.94 --> 01:24:47.34 And I think for a good reason, you know, because a lot of these guys when I talk about
01:24:47.34 --> 01:24:50.50 combat experience, they're on their third fourth floor in the Iraq.
01:24:50.50 --> 01:24:51.50 Totally man.
01:24:51.50 --> 01:24:52.50 You're coming in.
01:24:52.50 --> 01:24:53.50 Yep.
01:24:53.50 --> 01:24:54.34 They're on their, they've already done.
01:24:54.34 --> 01:24:57.54 You're wearing your top gun patch on your shoulder of your can.
01:24:57.54 --> 01:25:00.22 Well, what's worse is I'm not wearing my top gun patch.
01:25:00.22 --> 01:25:01.22 I'm wearing my camis.
01:25:01.22 --> 01:25:03.90 And they're like, have you ever washed those camis?
01:25:03.90 --> 01:25:05.26 I'm like, as a matter of fact, I haven't.
01:25:05.26 --> 01:25:08.10 They're fresh, you know, brand new.
01:25:08.10 --> 01:25:11.86 And they're wearing their camis from, they did the march up to Baghdad.
01:25:11.86 --> 01:25:15.06 They went home for four months and psycha right back around and did OIF2.
01:25:15.06 --> 01:25:16.06 Guys, it did fullusion.
01:25:16.06 --> 01:25:17.06 They're back.
01:25:17.06 --> 01:25:18.98 And they're on the third deployment in three years.
01:25:18.98 --> 01:25:20.70 And they're legit deployments.
01:25:20.70 --> 01:25:24.14 And, you know, Dave Burke, Mr. Topkin, shows up, and was like, where's this brigade
01:25:24.14 --> 01:25:25.14 platoon?
01:25:25.14 --> 01:25:26.14 You know, where's my salt team?
01:25:26.14 --> 01:25:31.18 You know, and I think that skepticism of, for good reason, is who is the
01:25:31.18 --> 01:25:32.18 best guy?
01:25:32.18 --> 01:25:36.70 And that's a real, that was a real leadership challenge for me, is to apply those things
01:25:36.70 --> 01:25:41.34 that I knew were effective, but in an environment that I'm totally out of my comfort zone,
01:25:41.34 --> 01:25:42.34 man.
01:25:42.34 --> 01:25:43.34 I'm totally out of my comfort zone.
01:25:43.34 --> 01:25:48.54 And I have to apply a skill set of things that I just haven't, I haven't shot a rifle
01:25:48.54 --> 01:25:50.18 since 1994.
01:25:50.18 --> 01:25:53.22 I got to the basic school in October, 1994, the first thing you do is go to the rifle
01:25:53.22 --> 01:25:54.22 range.
01:25:54.22 --> 01:25:58.18 That's the last time my school is a trigger on a rifle was October of 1994.
01:25:58.18 --> 01:26:02.62 The here it is is, you know, January of 2006, prepping to go to Ramadi, and I got to
01:26:02.62 --> 01:26:04.78 sit in my M4.
01:26:04.78 --> 01:26:07.58 So they should be skeptical a little bit.
01:26:07.58 --> 01:26:12.18 And it was a challenge for me, a real leadership challenge of to be successful in a place
01:26:12.18 --> 01:26:13.18 that I'm not comfortable with.
01:26:13.18 --> 01:26:18.78 To be honest with you, if you told me I was going to lead a squadron in combat, I'd feel
01:26:18.78 --> 01:26:20.50 pretty comfortable doing that.
01:26:20.50 --> 01:26:24.10 I know it would be a challenge, it'd be hard, but I wouldn't feel like, I don't know
01:26:24.10 --> 01:26:25.74 about this, I would be all over it.
01:26:25.74 --> 01:26:30.10 I don't mean to say easy, but right in my wheelhouse, not true for that.
01:26:30.10 --> 01:26:35.30 So I worked hard to try to be successful in that, and you know, you got to get your Marines
01:26:35.30 --> 01:26:39.86 to buy off on your program, you know, because you're going to go down town with those
01:26:39.86 --> 01:26:43.94 guys, you know, and every relationship with anyone with those guys was different as you
01:26:43.94 --> 01:26:47.66 know, you know, and you got to build those relationships and demonstrate that, you know,
01:26:47.66 --> 01:26:49.26 this is going to work.
01:26:49.26 --> 01:26:53.30 And then, you know, just talk a little bit about, you know, people have heard about what
01:26:53.30 --> 01:26:59.02 you bruiser was doing over in Ramadi, and we'll get to how we interacted, but overall,
01:26:59.02 --> 01:27:04.30 all you guys doing, when you first got there, you just kind of jumped into it, we could
01:27:04.30 --> 01:27:06.78 feed as they say.
01:27:06.78 --> 01:27:08.78 We did, man.
01:27:08.78 --> 01:27:10.42 So I get there.
01:27:10.42 --> 01:27:13.82 I've got a salt team that stands for supporting arms liaison team.
01:27:13.82 --> 01:27:17.94 Really what it meant was three of those little four man teams, grouped together in a
01:27:17.94 --> 01:27:23.46 one 13-man team, because we had an additional corpsman, little medic with us.
01:27:23.46 --> 01:27:29.22 So I had three of those teams that I was responsible for, and I kind of knew what I expected
01:27:29.22 --> 01:27:30.22 was going to happen.
01:27:30.22 --> 01:27:33.62 I got there that I would be in what's called the talk, the tactical operations center,
01:27:33.62 --> 01:27:39.50 which was I kind of run things from the desk and farm out my teams and units to support
01:27:39.50 --> 01:27:40.66 the guys that needed our help.
01:27:40.66 --> 01:27:42.26 These army units are going to go to missions.
01:27:42.26 --> 01:27:44.54 They needed someone to help them control the air.
01:27:44.54 --> 01:27:45.54 I had those teams.
01:27:45.54 --> 01:27:46.94 I would give them those teams.
01:27:46.94 --> 01:27:53.78 Well, it took basically no time to get there and realize that the demand signal for our support
01:27:53.78 --> 01:27:56.46 was higher than we could have ever responded to.
01:27:56.46 --> 01:28:00.62 They needed 20 of our teams, not three.
01:28:00.62 --> 01:28:06.34 And so that idea that I would kind of be a COC guy, a talk guy, was over in the first day,
01:28:06.34 --> 01:28:09.14 because as I get there and we're going to turn over the other angle of team getting
01:28:09.14 --> 01:28:13.38 ready to leave, he's introducing me to all the people he's been working with.
01:28:13.38 --> 01:28:17.26 It's like 15 different teams.
01:28:17.26 --> 01:28:20.58 They're not running operations like three battalions.
01:28:20.58 --> 01:28:23.58 It's 40 squads.
01:28:23.58 --> 01:28:27.94 These guys are going out in 12, 13, and they all need you.
01:28:27.94 --> 01:28:28.94 And there's operations.
01:28:28.94 --> 01:28:33.58 I mean, just so everyone is there's 5,600 people in the 1, 180 or you showed up in the
01:28:33.58 --> 01:28:36.42 2, 2, 2, 2, 6,000 people or whatever.
01:28:36.42 --> 01:28:40.38 And there's operations going on all over Ramadi, every single night, there's people patrol
01:28:40.38 --> 01:28:43.14 and there's people getting in fire fights, every single night, there's constant gun
01:28:43.14 --> 01:28:44.14 fire.
01:28:44.14 --> 01:28:47.10 And so there's no way with three teams you're going to cover all that.
01:28:47.10 --> 01:28:48.10 You can't do it.
01:28:48.10 --> 01:28:49.10 Yeah.
01:28:49.10 --> 01:28:54.82 And that was sort of the immediate awareness for me is not only was I not going to be able
01:28:54.82 --> 01:28:56.94 to support everything.
01:28:56.94 --> 01:29:00.78 I know how to prioritize and tell folks, hey, we can do this and not that.
01:29:00.78 --> 01:29:02.74 I can help you here or there.
01:29:02.74 --> 01:29:06.82 And so very quickly, it was a matter of how am I going to break down my team and support
01:29:06.82 --> 01:29:09.02 these guys.
01:29:09.02 --> 01:29:15.02 I did have an advantage that I was as an F-18 pilot, that was the primary aircraft, F-18's
01:29:15.02 --> 01:29:17.18 and herers of the primary aircraft that was doing the support.
01:29:17.18 --> 01:29:19.94 And I knew those airplanes really well.
01:29:19.94 --> 01:29:23.82 And I was able to very quickly when I saw what the army, hey, we're doing this patrol
01:29:23.82 --> 01:29:24.82 today.
01:29:24.82 --> 01:29:28.30 And we're going to take our humbys from the camp Ramadi to go to this location.
01:29:28.30 --> 01:29:31.38 And it would be really difficult just to get there, just navigating at night in your
01:29:31.38 --> 01:29:35.34 humbys on the night vision goggles and the roads can be kind of confusing and you know what
01:29:35.34 --> 01:29:39.02 it's like down there and some days you're operating in downtown Ramadi and it's straight
01:29:39.02 --> 01:29:42.58 up urban combat like just buildings.
01:29:42.58 --> 01:29:47.22 And five miles away you can be in a place we called it my Charlie one that it looks
01:29:47.22 --> 01:29:48.22 like a Vietnam.
01:29:48.22 --> 01:29:53.58 I mean it's the contrast if we're being so close together was so incredible how different
01:29:53.58 --> 01:29:54.58 those places were.
01:29:54.58 --> 01:29:56.30 And so every environment was different.
01:29:56.30 --> 01:30:00.54 I was able to understand how what airplanes could do well and not well in those environments.
01:30:00.54 --> 01:30:05.02 And so as they ask for support on my head, I can't really do that but what I can do is this.
01:30:05.02 --> 01:30:06.94 And maybe this would be more helpful for you.
01:30:06.94 --> 01:30:10.62 And I could very quickly build a relationship with the army which is really who you needed
01:30:10.62 --> 01:30:13.02 to be the best support for the Marines.
01:30:13.02 --> 01:30:14.02 They were going to get on board.
01:30:14.02 --> 01:30:15.02 We were good.
01:30:15.02 --> 01:30:16.02 We had a relationship.
01:30:16.02 --> 01:30:19.82 I wasn't worried about my Marines and us building our team.
01:30:19.82 --> 01:30:25.34 What I was worried about was us as a team being effective for the folks we were supporting.
01:30:25.34 --> 01:30:27.70 And showing that we could do good work for those guys.
01:30:27.70 --> 01:30:29.70 And we took a very different approach.
01:30:29.70 --> 01:30:33.34 I immediately broke our team into three separate teams, 6162 and 630.
01:30:33.34 --> 01:30:38.74 I actually sent the 613 team, a guy named Alan to another base, Blue Diamond.
01:30:38.74 --> 01:30:41.82 And you remember that base right across the river because there was a company base out of
01:30:41.82 --> 01:30:45.06 Blue Diamond that we're doing operations independently and they never had any angle
01:30:45.06 --> 01:30:46.06 to support.
01:30:46.06 --> 01:30:50.26 So I do, you got to go move, they literally moved there and lived with those guys and then
01:30:50.26 --> 01:30:53.06 my other team 6162 Adam.
01:30:53.06 --> 01:30:59.02 And I just, we took a whiteboard and all the requests for support.
01:30:59.02 --> 01:31:00.58 We just started plugging in our names in.
01:31:00.58 --> 01:31:04.66 And so it was just, I had five guys, he had 48 is on Humby at my own Humby.
01:31:04.66 --> 01:31:09.78 We had all the weapons, all the radios and just started to just go do operations.
01:31:09.78 --> 01:31:12.26 Two to eight would do everything for just a little vehicle patrol where they would just
01:31:12.26 --> 01:31:13.26 do a presence patrol.
01:31:13.26 --> 01:31:14.70 They're two Humby is driving around the city.
01:31:14.70 --> 01:31:17.78 We would just jump in on that and just bring a third truck, which was a ton of firepower
01:31:17.78 --> 01:31:19.10 and awareness.
01:31:19.10 --> 01:31:22.62 Sometimes we were just doing foot patrols and we would just go walk around and do moving
01:31:22.62 --> 01:31:26.10 to contact or do room clearing stuff like that.
01:31:26.10 --> 01:31:31.90 I found myself way, way out of my comfort zone very early.
01:31:31.90 --> 01:31:39.70 I think my second mission there was a raid where I was ended up clearing a room.
01:31:39.70 --> 01:31:43.78 I was in a stack of dudes clearing a room.
01:31:43.78 --> 01:31:49.50 Well I was trying to talk to airplanes overhead and it was just basically a manpower
01:31:49.50 --> 01:31:50.50 shortage.
01:31:50.50 --> 01:31:56.02 Yeah, we'd get in, you need to, you need to go, guys go clear the room and rush that.
01:31:56.02 --> 01:31:58.34 Now, in I was a senior mid-grade major.
01:31:58.34 --> 01:32:00.78 I was always kind of one of the senior guys, but I wasn't in charge of this.
01:32:00.78 --> 01:32:03.38 So I would be working for a first lieutenant, which was perfectly fine.
01:32:03.38 --> 01:32:04.38 It was his platoon.
01:32:04.38 --> 01:32:05.38 He was doing this mission.
01:32:05.38 --> 01:32:06.38 He knew what he was doing.
01:32:06.38 --> 01:32:08.26 I was there to support his best as I could.
01:32:08.26 --> 01:32:10.54 That image of like, y'all just get up on the roof and control there.
01:32:10.54 --> 01:32:11.54 It'll be awesome.
01:32:11.54 --> 01:32:13.30 You need me to blow up negative.
01:32:13.30 --> 01:32:17.30 I mean, it was, hey, get in line and start getting out here.
01:32:17.30 --> 01:32:20.18 Now, I think that I remember that second mission.
01:32:20.18 --> 01:32:23.86 We're with the two to eight and the lieutenant was, I think he was like, I think he worked
01:32:23.86 --> 01:32:24.86 at Home Depot.
01:32:24.86 --> 01:32:25.86 No joke.
01:32:25.86 --> 01:32:26.86 I mean, National Guard units.
01:32:26.86 --> 01:32:28.46 Yeah, National Guard units, these dudes were awesome.
01:32:28.46 --> 01:32:31.58 They'd been there for probably 10 or 11 months by the time I got there.
01:32:31.58 --> 01:32:32.58 They're maybe even longer.
01:32:32.58 --> 01:32:33.78 They've been there almost a year.
01:32:33.78 --> 01:32:39.06 Hardened dudes that had lost a lot of guys and sacrificed a ton, but I was learning everything
01:32:39.06 --> 01:32:41.74 I could from them because they were veterans and I was brand new.
01:32:41.74 --> 01:32:45.14 I was supposed to bring the great capability, but the reality was I was just soaking up from
01:32:45.14 --> 01:32:47.66 them as much as I could.
01:32:47.66 --> 01:32:51.42 And I'm, I'm clear in a room with this guy, you know.
01:32:51.42 --> 01:32:55.54 So, the phrase, what am I doing here?
01:32:55.54 --> 01:32:59.58 Went through my head a lot while I was there.
01:32:59.58 --> 01:33:03.14 And it was just kind of, remind you, was it type of place that the deal was is when you got
01:33:03.14 --> 01:33:08.06 there, it was just a bullet train and you just jumped on the train.
01:33:08.06 --> 01:33:09.06 You had to.
01:33:09.06 --> 01:33:10.06 You couldn't slow things down.
01:33:10.06 --> 01:33:13.54 You certainly couldn't ask those other guys, hey, can we dial it back a little bit
01:33:13.54 --> 01:33:15.34 we need to get up to speed?
01:33:15.34 --> 01:33:18.74 They were just doing their thing and if you were going to be anything other than a hindrance
01:33:18.74 --> 01:33:21.26 you need to get on board immediately.
01:33:21.26 --> 01:33:24.50 And so that's what we did as best we could.
01:33:24.50 --> 01:33:29.34 And I have a lot to thank for those guys at T2A because no matter how hard we tried those
01:33:29.34 --> 01:33:31.54 first couple of times we're just getting up to speed.
01:33:31.54 --> 01:33:35.70 We're not, you know, bringing our A game, we're trying to figure out what's going on around
01:33:35.70 --> 01:33:39.50 us and there's no doubt that without those guys, their leadership, their willingness
01:33:39.50 --> 01:33:42.10 to kind of bring us on board and get us up to speed.
01:33:42.10 --> 01:33:43.58 That played a big part.
01:33:43.58 --> 01:33:46.14 We got up to speed quickly, but they won.
01:33:46.14 --> 01:33:47.74 I'm sure, you know, we were struggling to tell us.
01:33:47.74 --> 01:33:51.78 It's just like we were talking about with flying and jiu-jitsu and fighting and everything
01:33:51.78 --> 01:33:52.78 else.
01:33:52.78 --> 01:33:54.18 You show up there and things are going.
01:33:54.18 --> 01:33:55.74 They're not slowed down a third.
01:33:55.74 --> 01:33:59.38 They're going five times faster and you're just seeing, you know, you're getting told
01:33:59.38 --> 01:34:00.38 to clear a room.
01:34:00.38 --> 01:34:03.54 That's the only thing in the world you can see is now this room and you're not aware of
01:34:03.54 --> 01:34:07.90 all this other stuff that's going on and it definitely takes some ops to get your, get
01:34:07.90 --> 01:34:09.54 your senses about you of what's happening.
01:34:09.54 --> 01:34:10.54 Yeah.
01:34:10.54 --> 01:34:13.38 And the ops were, there were so many different kinds of operations like I said, you
01:34:13.38 --> 01:34:18.66 need to go from doing just, you know, a three humvy presence patrol and downtown
01:34:18.66 --> 01:34:24.26 or body is not cool. It's not. It's just you're just waiting for something to go wrong,
01:34:24.26 --> 01:34:27.90 you know, whether it's getting lit up, you know, in a firefight, RPG's getting shot. I mean,
01:34:27.90 --> 01:34:31.38 you were literally just driving around waiting for somebody to do something to you, you
01:34:31.38 --> 01:34:32.94 know, these presence patrols.
01:34:32.94 --> 01:34:37.06 And then you go right from that to you get some intelligence that somebody needed to
01:34:37.06 --> 01:34:40.78 grab was in, you know, a house somewhere in a totally different environment and you'd be
01:34:40.78 --> 01:34:42.18 off doing a raid.
01:34:42.18 --> 01:34:44.78 We help stand up the QRF. You talked about that in the past.
01:34:44.78 --> 01:34:48.54 The quick reaction force where you literally just waited right outside the gate
01:34:48.54 --> 01:34:53.74 to the main base for somebody to call for help. Okay, something's gone wrong. It's here,
01:34:53.74 --> 01:35:00.94 come help us. And so we just started doing all these missions. And I, I just was on board
01:35:00.94 --> 01:35:04.50 with all of them. And they vary. They were very different from day to day. And you got
01:35:04.50 --> 01:35:06.58 to call for fire, too. Do you legit?
01:35:06.58 --> 01:35:13.94 We did. We, we between me, I did a lot and my teams, we, I controlled the release of every
01:35:13.94 --> 01:35:19.94 single piece of ordinance in the Marine Corps imagery, Marine Corps inventory. So every piece
01:35:19.94 --> 01:35:23.98 of ordinance that the, the air, the hornets and the carriers dropped and everything from
01:35:23.98 --> 01:35:28.76 the huge in the cobras and our, we called our teller as well. They had a, you know,
01:35:28.76 --> 01:35:33.08 a, a field of artillery battalion out there that we did controls from as I think, if I did
01:35:33.08 --> 01:35:38.78 myself. So, you know, that store, you know, you get to TBS. There's an old saying in the
01:35:38.78 --> 01:35:42.94 Marine Corps, we all subscribed to it. Every Marine's a rifleman. And we are a top
01:35:42.94 --> 01:35:47.74 unit instructor that could not be further from the truth. Because the last thing you are
01:35:47.74 --> 01:35:52.06 as a top gun, as the training officer at Top Gun, skiing in Lake Tahoe on the Saturday afternoon
01:35:52.06 --> 01:35:57.10 is a rifleman. But I will, I will say this for the Marine Corps. Yeah, I'm biased. I'm a little
01:35:57.10 --> 01:36:03.26 proctor of the Marine Corps. Dude, it's all in there. The OCS, TBS, all that exposure, all
01:36:03.26 --> 01:36:06.70 that doctrine, everything that you learn, it's there. Now it took a while to dig down and
01:36:06.70 --> 01:36:10.78 find it. And those same things that when I went to OCS and I was a skiniest guy there and
01:36:10.78 --> 01:36:14.14 I was scared I couldn't get through it on my way to second. Bigger tougher, stronger
01:36:14.14 --> 01:36:19.34 dudes are doing this or not doing this and I am. It's all in there. And so I just had to
01:36:19.34 --> 01:36:27.42 figure out a tap that stuff again and bring it back up and just go do it. So, great decision.
01:36:27.42 --> 01:36:32.94 Nira, I am in Ramadi, get an after it. And then you guys showed up. Yeah, there was one story
01:36:32.94 --> 01:36:39.02 you were telling me that you were calling for fire up in MC1 and it was your buddy. Yeah.
01:36:39.02 --> 01:36:45.74 Yeah, we are doing what's called movement to contact my favorite mission as a pilot. Nothing
01:36:45.74 --> 01:36:49.26 better than movement to contact. And the movement to contact mission is you literally drive your
01:36:49.26 --> 01:36:53.34 humbys, take all your your folks out and you set up a staging area in the north side of this
01:36:54.70 --> 01:36:59.82 this big area is big, kind of wooded dirt has like little ravines and trees and stuff like that.
01:36:59.82 --> 01:37:05.34 And we would just we would walk up a troll. And you know, if 10 15 guys would just go from north
01:37:05.34 --> 01:37:09.98 to south and the mission was called movement to contact. So you walked until you got in contact.
01:37:09.98 --> 01:37:14.78 Which went you got into a firefight. And I remember not the same day but my first day going there.
01:37:14.78 --> 01:37:18.22 I think it was a Bravo Company at 2 to 8. I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure it was and I met
01:37:18.22 --> 01:37:22.94 the platoon commander for the first time. And I kind of get out of my humbys. I walk up and I'm looking
01:37:22.94 --> 01:37:25.98 for the platoon commander. I'm there as a supporting asset. I'm a helpful guy because I bring
01:37:25.98 --> 01:37:30.86 airplanes. It's going to be good for them. And he walks up and he's got a shotgun hanging on his
01:37:30.86 --> 01:37:36.94 kid. And you know I was a brand new guy but I was I'm like hey what's with the shotgun?
01:37:36.94 --> 01:37:41.42 You know I have a rifle. He was like hey the bounce with the I found that this is the best weapon
01:37:41.42 --> 01:37:46.14 for these type of missions. And it turns out he actually was right on that patrol. It's like
01:37:47.26 --> 01:37:50.54 dude what am I doing here man? You know I'm going to do a foot patrol with a guy with shotgun.
01:37:52.14 --> 01:37:58.38 So I knew that I was in there's a lot in store for that. And we would do these patrols
01:37:58.38 --> 01:38:02.86 these these movement contacts and you'd end up in a building. And my job as a fact was hey get out
01:38:02.86 --> 01:38:07.34 in the building get up on top of the roof right away and I would do Overwatch. You know similar
01:38:07.34 --> 01:38:11.42 different assets I had airplanes I had radios seals would do Overwatch all the time and there's
01:38:11.42 --> 01:38:14.70 just a matter of cover and moves. I would get up in the roof and I'd go hey this is what I see.
01:38:14.70 --> 01:38:18.78 This is what the airplane sees. Okay you guys jump to that next building. Sometimes the next building
01:38:18.78 --> 01:38:23.18 would be 20 yards away sometimes it would be 200 yards away. So you would you would just do these
01:38:23.18 --> 01:38:27.58 bounding movements building to building and then when they get to the next building my other guy would
01:38:27.58 --> 01:38:30.46 be up in the roof. It's a good way to run down and go to the next building.
01:38:34.22 --> 01:38:40.22 And so we get into this building and as soon as they get up on top of the roof of the building
01:38:40.22 --> 01:38:44.22 so if you can picture it half of us are in the roof of the building half of the other guys are
01:38:44.22 --> 01:38:48.30 trying to move to the other building so they're out in the open. And from that other building as I
01:38:48.30 --> 01:38:53.34 get up in the roof that I look up in the first one happens is like three RPGs hit the building
01:38:53.34 --> 01:38:59.02 that I'm in directly underneath me. Probably my team by like 15 feet below us so above their heads
01:38:59.02 --> 01:39:04.78 and below us that's the first thing that happens and there was a vehicle like a truck and I was a
01:39:04.78 --> 01:39:10.06 car was like just some car in between on a look kind of a dirt road behind some trees where this
01:39:10.06 --> 01:39:16.14 fire came from and we had airplanes overhead. There was two F-18 D's I remember from an East Coast
01:39:16.14 --> 01:39:21.90 squadron and you know a TBS they teach you hey everyone Marines arrive on man and they say
01:39:21.90 --> 01:39:27.34 they tell you these stories is that one day you're going to be in a position where you're going to
01:39:27.34 --> 01:39:30.78 be in a firefight and there's going to be an airplane overhead and it's going to be a buddy
01:39:30.78 --> 01:39:34.54 of yours from TBS going to be your old buddy and you're going to be like hey Jaco it's day to
01:39:34.54 --> 01:39:38.38 help me out and Dave's going to roll in on his white horse and come over this hornet and blast
01:39:38.38 --> 01:39:43.26 these things out and your infantry buddy is going to thank you one day. I'm going to write on.
01:39:43.26 --> 01:39:49.10 The only problem was that I was on the ground and the guy I find the airplane was one of my closest
01:39:49.10 --> 01:39:56.22 friends again and Boo Frieden was an opso of the squash and I just left and no joke I'm like
01:39:57.58 --> 01:40:01.90 hey we're in a troops in contact you know we're taking fire from wherever and on the radio
01:40:02.94 --> 01:40:07.74 he says hey chip it's Boo what do you need and it took me to wrap back to TBS on the problem was I was supposed
01:40:07.74 --> 01:40:15.90 to be in an airplane when that happened and I'm like I said I said South to North call wings level
01:40:15.90 --> 01:40:21.18 and that's what happened and I got four passes from these FATs did these strafing runs on this car
01:40:21.18 --> 01:40:26.14 and I remember looking at the army guys with his first lieutenant and I looked at him I go
01:40:26.14 --> 01:40:31.66 you're going to be fine like super cool like very chill hey this just happened I see what's going on
01:40:31.66 --> 01:40:36.70 there's hornets over head out I saw everything what do you need I need this we're in and you
01:40:36.70 --> 01:40:41.58 the X call is wings level hey you're cleared hot and you know the hair and arms stand up
01:40:41.58 --> 01:40:47.34 telling us sorry just one of those stories where the Marine Corps for whatever insane reason
01:40:47.34 --> 01:40:51.90 will take FATs and train them millions of dollars and ten years of training them and they'll stick
01:40:51.90 --> 01:40:58.46 them on the ground and it's for that exact reason that that exact event was I could bring an asset
01:40:58.46 --> 01:41:03.98 that the army would never have an environment that they would never be able to use and through
01:41:03.98 --> 01:41:10.70 two buddies just talking pointing was to each other on the radio make it happen in like that and
01:41:12.70 --> 01:41:16.46 I was supposed to be in that airplane jacco that's how it was supposed to work out but in that
01:41:16.46 --> 01:41:20.62 particular day of man it was the roles of reverse but it was it was an awesome it was kind of a
01:41:20.62 --> 01:41:24.38 culmination of a lot of things like that the Marine Corps it's a legit that thing they'd read
01:41:24.38 --> 01:41:29.18 nuts it's a real thing and it was pretty satisfying to be awesome you see that carburetor in the ground
01:41:29.18 --> 01:41:36.30 and then eventually yeah I don't know maybe a month or so goes by and we show up and who's the
01:41:36.30 --> 01:41:44.30 first who do you meet first life yep life was the first guy that I met actually life in Tony
01:41:44.30 --> 01:41:51.18 all right show up together um so we had seen you guys you know we had turned over and we were just
01:41:51.18 --> 01:41:55.02 kind of getting up to speed we probably been there maybe a month or so before you guys had so you
01:41:55.02 --> 01:41:59.34 know quick learning curve we're just kind of getting comfortable with what's going on we also
01:41:59.34 --> 01:42:05.58 know there's a new brigade of platoon coming in I'm sorry a new um uh uh armor division coming in
01:42:05.58 --> 01:42:09.02 the we know that the unit that we're there the two to eight that brigade combat team is leaving
01:42:09.02 --> 01:42:14.06 we knew new brigade combat team is coming in and we were actually in just a relative a short
01:42:14.06 --> 01:42:17.74 period of time we were kind of the continuity because all the old guys are leaving we had we had the
01:42:17.74 --> 01:42:21.90 overlap so we had a kind of a prominent role with a new battalion and the new battalion commander
01:42:21.90 --> 01:42:28.30 he's retired now um awesome dude from uh one three seven armor guy named Tedesco just
01:42:28.30 --> 01:42:33.18 an awesome dude just an awesome dude awesome um he would have been there as part of his
01:42:33.18 --> 01:42:37.90 turnover it had come out a couple months prior maybe a month prior and saw us and we had my favorite
01:42:37.90 --> 01:42:44.94 thing about Tedesco is like he said awesome guy we we were getting ready to do a big operation
01:42:44.94 --> 01:42:48.46 with them I think it was the first time we were pushing the south center of our body and we were in his
01:42:48.46 --> 01:42:55.82 briefing and he's quoting pat but he's quoting pat in the movie he's just kidding yeah I was like
01:42:55.82 --> 01:43:01.26 yes yes thank you thank you for bringing me here this day he was awesome and he had seen me
01:43:01.26 --> 01:43:06.38 he just so happened when he was doing his initial turnover before the the the battalion came out
01:43:06.38 --> 01:43:14.14 I had done I had controlled uh um a release I controlled a hellfire and blew up a car and he got
01:43:14.14 --> 01:43:17.90 to see it and it was kind of a cool thing is he comes and he's like who you know who these guys
01:43:17.90 --> 01:43:21.34 uh I'm in the middle of doing a real control happening being the COC that day
01:43:21.98 --> 01:43:25.58 blew up a car it's all in the video get this big TV screens to show the whole thing this card
01:43:25.58 --> 01:43:30.30 detonates and cool pictures and everything and he he comes over to me after we're done I'm kind of
01:43:30.30 --> 01:43:33.98 sitting there and he said Lieutenant Colonel and the major in the hicer he's like can you do that
01:43:33.98 --> 01:43:38.54 when we get here my absolutely man he's like we're gonna get along great that was my
01:43:38.54 --> 01:43:42.54 initial inter-inter-actual with him so it was awesome and so we knew when they were coming back we
01:43:42.54 --> 01:43:46.22 had already just to virtually that experience built some pretty good inroads of them and we
01:43:46.22 --> 01:43:51.10 are gonna do some good work he was also the type of guy look there's this is a whole brigade
01:43:51.10 --> 01:43:55.66 combat team came in that's 5000 guys but his battalion that group of you know several hundred
01:43:55.66 --> 01:44:00.06 was really the core group that I initially did most of my work with and his approach was if you
01:44:00.06 --> 01:44:06.30 can help us you're on the team they're um same exact attitude he had with us yeah for sure for
01:44:06.30 --> 01:44:10.86 all the enablers so uh they were called the bandits and they had a little bandit pin kind of a
01:44:10.86 --> 01:44:16.70 skull and crosspone's kind of thing you were if you you were I was a bandit teacher just totally
01:44:16.70 --> 01:44:23.34 onboard the team and he treated us like his own guys and that was awesome and so um all the enablers
01:44:23.34 --> 01:44:27.58 we had military we had working dogs we had explosive ordinance disposal we had the angle go
01:44:27.58 --> 01:44:31.58 folks we had the seals in all these different groups from different places that none of them were
01:44:31.58 --> 01:44:36.38 assigned to him but his approach was if you can help my soldiers out you're on your bandit you're on
01:44:36.38 --> 01:44:40.14 the team and everybody's like right on let's do this because that's you need to work with them
01:44:40.14 --> 01:44:46.38 anyway I'm as well make the best of it we started to do a couple of missions and everyone of
01:44:46.38 --> 01:44:51.18 those missions was your teams and my teams uh and I would say probably in the first week or so you
01:44:51.18 --> 01:44:55.02 know I'm guessing a little bit of dates but relatively quick in the first couple of missions
01:44:55.74 --> 01:45:00.30 we are doing the similar things we were bringing support and Overwatch and helping these guys
01:45:00.30 --> 01:45:03.34 through their job which is the exact same thing you guys were doing you know totally different
01:45:03.34 --> 01:45:09.26 ways but ultimately we were supporting these guys I meant my my little building there or one day
01:45:09.26 --> 01:45:14.94 whatever just sitting around prepping for something and in walks lay in Tony you know they
01:45:14.94 --> 01:45:18.06 they drove over from your base which is kind of you know a little bit of a haul around around
01:45:18.06 --> 01:45:24.70 their job and it goes hey man um love to work as you more we find a way that we can work together
01:45:24.70 --> 01:45:28.46 in some of these missions and we got this big mission coming up you want to come down and
01:45:28.46 --> 01:45:34.62 and breathe with us oh yeah absolutely I'd love to go breathe with the seals and be awesome
01:45:34.62 --> 01:45:39.50 thought it would just be the kind of cool one time thing I could see how seals do the business um and
01:45:39.50 --> 01:45:43.82 that was it that was his introduction had lathe and Tony I'll be really candid I'd like to think
01:45:43.82 --> 01:45:48.30 I would have done that I doubt I would have gone to shark base and knocked on your door and said hey
01:45:48.30 --> 01:45:53.18 lathe jacca let's do some work together he made that initial contact and him and Tony were
01:45:53.18 --> 01:45:58.22 definitely equal opportunity employers exactly and we the same thing as you know Colonel Tadesco
01:45:58.22 --> 01:46:02.38 if we thought someone could do something to help us out or we could complement each other in any
01:46:02.38 --> 01:46:07.42 way man we were knocking on doors to to try and make that happen for sure yeah and that was his
01:46:07.42 --> 01:46:12.86 approach um I didn't I'd never done any work on the ground I didn't know much about the seals
01:46:12.86 --> 01:46:19.02 I'll be very blunt I had my own opinion of what I assumed you guys would be like and it was
01:46:19.02 --> 01:46:23.50 probably something out of the movies expected like long beards and do's just running around doing
01:46:23.50 --> 01:46:28.06 their own thing uh and so I was actually a little surprised that that lathe came and asked to do
01:46:28.06 --> 01:46:33.26 some work with us and so I I went to that first night mission uh that first brief I don't want
01:46:33.26 --> 01:46:38.46 to say I was skeptical but I was certainly interested in what because my fear was that you guys
01:46:38.46 --> 01:46:42.06 are going to go do your own thing and my guys are kind of just either not be able to keep up
01:46:42.06 --> 01:46:45.74 not know what you're doing and not fit in very well and be able to help out and just kind of put
01:46:45.74 --> 01:46:53.90 ourselves at risk and and look I'll I'll say this very bluntly I have a very high bar when you
01:46:53.90 --> 01:46:58.22 leave Top Gunna what to expect from a mission brief and mission execution a mission debrief because that's
01:46:58.22 --> 01:47:02.22 what we're all about and I was pretty sure that there's no chance that you're going to do anything
01:47:02.22 --> 01:47:11.10 anywhere near that and I was shocked and kind of overwhelmed at how professional your
01:47:11.10 --> 01:47:15.26 organ at your team was and that was the biggest thing for me was what are these guys going to be like
01:47:15.26 --> 01:47:19.82 I just sort of picture day kind of a pickup game hit us go there and just you know kill some
01:47:19.82 --> 01:47:23.66 bad guys and come on back and high five each other and dude it was one of the most professional
01:47:23.66 --> 01:47:28.14 organized mission briefs I totally understood what your plan was I knew exactly what I was going to fit in
01:47:28.14 --> 01:47:32.22 we went and did it and then you guys debriefed after we came back after this it was a relative
01:47:32.22 --> 01:47:36.30 on event nothing really happened that night in terms of in the grand scheme of things that we saw
01:47:36.30 --> 01:47:41.10 over there and then you debriefed it you guys came back and you mission debriefed user there
01:47:41.10 --> 01:47:47.50 kind of clean a weapons and going through and analyzing what happened and that was it man I was totally
01:47:47.50 --> 01:47:52.38 on board I was I was I was I was sold that we could work together like pretty effectively
01:47:52.38 --> 01:47:56.38 and that was kind of the beginning it just sort of started out of the blue and you guys
01:47:56.38 --> 01:48:03.66 came down and asked to do some good work and we did a lot of work you're team did a lot of work with us
01:48:03.66 --> 01:48:08.54 because we we started to think because for our from our perspective and I know there's one
01:48:08.54 --> 01:48:12.78 junior officer out there who's now probably a lieutenant commander or maybe even a commander at this
01:48:12.78 --> 01:48:17.74 point but at that time you know he was on his first deployment and he was a jaytah what we call
01:48:17.74 --> 01:48:22.94 in the seal teams are air controllers are called a jaytah and so here he is and some of those
01:48:22.94 --> 01:48:28.06 missions instead of being a seal he's being a jaytah so he's one of those guys that looked over it
01:48:28.06 --> 01:48:32.22 you guys and said hey wait a second can you take this radio for me and do that thing so I can go
01:48:32.22 --> 01:48:40.38 do my frogman stuff over here and that at and plus again to be blunt you guys could do it a lot
01:48:40.38 --> 01:48:45.58 better than we could period you know we you know you were an F-18 pilot for crying out loud
01:48:45.58 --> 01:48:49.90 and we had a new guy junior officer on the radio trying to call for five you guys are just
01:48:49.90 --> 01:48:56.30 imminently better qualified to do it and so yeah we looked at it as if okay we that gives us one
01:48:56.30 --> 01:49:01.18 more shooter and it gives us a whole new level of expertise now of course there's jaytah
01:49:01.18 --> 01:49:06.22 and the seal teams that they are a lot more experience and they are awesome and of course but in our
01:49:06.22 --> 01:49:12.46 group you to bring you guys was just a huge level up for us to get a lot better and give us more
01:49:12.46 --> 01:49:19.18 people to maneuver as seals on assaults or on Overwatch or whatever so it turned out to be a
01:49:19.82 --> 01:49:25.98 real good little little relationship that I got going there it was a classic win win when when a
01:49:25.98 --> 01:49:32.06 seal says hey would you control the air so I can go shoot people you know and that means I'm no I don't
01:49:32.06 --> 01:49:36.54 have to clear that room and being a position where I might have to do something like that I'm all over
01:49:36.54 --> 01:49:40.78 and I yeah I know you're talking about we had a he and I had a great relationship someone that I
01:49:40.78 --> 01:49:46.54 really loved working with who wanted to go be a frogman like you said I wanted to go control
01:49:46.54 --> 01:49:54.30 their plants and we found a way to make that stuff work now it was it was a big deal for me though
01:49:54.30 --> 01:50:01.90 man to to for me and my guys to work with you guys because you've said this on the podcast and I know
01:50:02.62 --> 01:50:07.18 I know how organizations can we're not necessarily perocule that we don't trust other people
01:50:07.18 --> 01:50:12.54 but we get really comfortable how we do business and to just bring in another group of dudes I think
01:50:12.54 --> 01:50:17.26 this also speaks volumes to the desk and all those guys you're gonna just you want to make sure
01:50:17.26 --> 01:50:23.42 those guys can keep up you know and everybody knows that you guys are legit man and to keep up you
01:50:23.42 --> 01:50:26.62 got you're not to keep up you're not to carry your own weight and you're gonna have to make it happen
01:50:26.62 --> 01:50:30.46 you're gonna have to provide something because the minute you become a drain on the on the team
01:50:31.66 --> 01:50:36.22 you know you're gonna get cut loose and we we couldn't afford to be a drain on you and we couldn't
01:50:36.22 --> 01:50:40.38 afford to have other people be a drain on us so I think there's a lot of kind of at the beginning of
01:50:41.10 --> 01:50:45.58 there's there are a lot of reasons why it wouldn't have worked there's a whole bunch of reasons why it wouldn't have
01:50:45.58 --> 01:50:49.74 worked and the only reason it did work is that everybody was committed to building a relationship to support
01:50:50.62 --> 01:50:55.02 the battalion that was it we all have the same end state in mind it wasn't about what can the seals do to be
01:50:55.02 --> 01:50:58.78 seals and be great that you know what can we do to support those guys yeah well this is a whole thing I was
01:50:58.78 --> 01:51:04.22 opening up with that's sort of where that came from it's just this attitude that everybody there was on the same
01:51:04.22 --> 01:51:10.62 team straight up on the same team and so then that turned into big missions you know big missions
01:51:10.62 --> 01:51:16.30 pushing into Ramadi putting in the combat outpost you know night after night after night
01:51:16.30 --> 01:51:23.58 day after day doing those those big operations and that relationship just got just got stronger and stronger
01:51:23.58 --> 01:51:30.54 you know lay obviously with you and and just turned into something really
01:51:30.54 --> 01:51:40.54 we not just not just cool but man effective yeah effective it was I mean in that deployment I
01:51:40.54 --> 01:51:45.50 kept along journal like I took a lot of notes on my experience there and I've gone back and
01:51:45.50 --> 01:51:50.94 we read it a few times and I've somewhat recently throughout that whole thing one of the common
01:51:50.94 --> 01:51:59.18 themes is how the the lathe and I did this today are we did stuff with you all the time and it
01:51:59.18 --> 01:52:05.10 kind of became in that middle that kind of June July August I mean that was all we were really doing
01:52:05.10 --> 01:52:10.78 because we were so busy and the big up was kicking off and we were starting to get into downtown
01:52:10.78 --> 01:52:16.86 but you know you never been all these clearing all this stuff and so the need for us to support
01:52:16.86 --> 01:52:20.94 the army the need for you to support the army again we could have had ten times many of folks and
01:52:20.94 --> 01:52:26.14 we've probably still could have done more work um everything in that journal it's just about what we're
01:52:26.14 --> 01:52:30.46 doing together I think at the time I just kind of lost track of it because we were just every day
01:52:30.46 --> 01:52:34.38 get up and go do something I mean there's no down days there was hardly ever any time we weren't doing
01:52:34.38 --> 01:52:43.50 anything and it was almost always with you guys and it was a huge highlight for me to to to be with
01:52:43.50 --> 01:52:50.30 a group of guys that were so on board with just making things happen you guys had an incredible
01:52:50.30 --> 01:52:56.94 Mac of this is in the way or this process keeps it yeah we got that sort of down hey I need to get air
01:52:56.94 --> 01:53:01.90 points uh that what yeah did to do this and this you had no no we get we get this sort of out so
01:53:02.46 --> 01:53:07.18 you guys had kind of had cornered the market on what do you need will make we'll get it will make it happen
01:53:07.18 --> 01:53:12.86 and for me to be able to get that asset sort of delivered that I could and you did all the work
01:53:12.86 --> 01:53:16.94 to get it but I can control the hell out of it right on man I didn't have do any of the work to
01:53:16.94 --> 01:53:21.26 explain why I needed this because you guys did all that work and you had a valid reason for it they
01:53:21.26 --> 01:53:26.22 were laughing at me if I said I wanted an AC 130 gunship like who are you I'm Dave Burke man and
01:53:26.22 --> 01:53:31.74 like negative lathe and jocca need an AC 130 gunship not every time you know obviously there's a
01:53:31.74 --> 01:53:34.70 thin asset but that thing should have over head and then you get the guy we were talking about
01:53:34.70 --> 01:53:39.18 like you want to control this I'm like yes I do I want to control this thing so there's a lot of
01:53:39.18 --> 01:53:44.62 mutual benefit there and I think we also proved is I think for the battalion and the brigade they
01:53:44.62 --> 01:53:48.70 figured out that we were really helpful in helping those guys accomplish what they wanted to accomplish
01:53:48.70 --> 01:53:52.94 and that was just I'm not putting very good words to it right now but as obviously real rewarding
01:53:52.94 --> 01:53:58.14 and it was a highlight of that deployment is our ability to work together through like I said
01:53:58.14 --> 01:54:01.66 there's a whole laundry list of reasons why we shouldn't have been able to do this a bunch you didn't
01:54:01.66 --> 01:54:06.14 work for me I didn't have rank you you're guy there's just a whole bunch institutional roadblocks
01:54:06.14 --> 01:54:09.02 that we could just stay in our own corners and our own thing and you and I could have never met
01:54:09.02 --> 01:54:13.50 and that wouldn't have really been all that uncommon you would have just been optimal
01:54:15.82 --> 01:54:22.70 it worked out man yeah a lot of awesome highlights all that deployment and obviously
01:54:24.30 --> 01:54:30.70 some of the worst days of our lives are over there June 20th
01:54:30.70 --> 01:54:41.74 talking about that yeah man so obviously I know we're gonna talk about this
01:54:43.74 --> 01:54:48.06 so we had been there quite a bit and I remember kind of the shock when we first got there talking
01:54:48.06 --> 01:54:54.14 to the two to eight I had my first am there I go to Alfa company and they've got them a memorial outside
01:54:54.14 --> 01:54:58.70 of their compound of all the soldiers that had been killed I can picture it's just kind of like a
01:54:58.70 --> 01:55:03.90 names are on a little placard and it's kind of a tall little pyramid looking thing with the
01:55:03.90 --> 01:55:11.10 names on there and you see it you understand it hey people have died here you get it it's not hard
01:55:11.10 --> 01:55:16.14 to to understand that those things have happened but there's this a level of disconnect when you
01:55:16.14 --> 01:55:21.18 first get there like people are dying but you know you haven't seen it and then you know very
01:55:21.18 --> 01:55:26.54 quick I think probably my second mission out there was kind of a QRF from a vehicle ID so basically
01:55:26.54 --> 01:55:32.46 I'm in a surgeon with a bunch of bombs in his vehicles got on between American Compo and
01:55:32.46 --> 01:55:38.14 blew himself up so I see my first dead body you know I see this real combat people are dying
01:55:38.14 --> 01:55:47.82 here it was an enemy wasn't the same and then you know March April May we started taking I mean
01:55:47.82 --> 01:55:51.98 not started we continue to take casualties and I'm starting to go to memorials and we're starting to
01:55:51.98 --> 01:55:56.30 see guys that we knew and worked with and were friends with and built relations with and
01:55:56.30 --> 01:56:01.26 they're they're they're getting killed or really gravely wounded and those memorials started to
01:56:01.26 --> 01:56:06.54 become every couple of days we're going to a memorial and that sort of ways on you I thought about
01:56:06.54 --> 01:56:10.54 this a lot and how it affected me you know it's a pilot being out of my comfort zone in this environment
01:56:10.54 --> 01:56:18.78 and what that was like but without trying to diminish any of that loss
01:56:18.78 --> 01:56:27.58 there's a there's a disconnect when it's not your person it's not your guy and on June 20th
01:56:28.14 --> 01:56:34.38 so Chris Leon who was my radio operator we were in a building that we had been in let me back up I was
01:56:34.38 --> 01:56:39.34 not there I had left that building that morning gone back to the CUC Adam's team with Chris had
01:56:39.34 --> 01:56:43.74 replaced us and we're basically just going back and forth operations and this this combat outpost
01:56:43.74 --> 01:56:48.62 because it gave us a really good view of the north part of the city and we had to be there basically
01:56:48.62 --> 01:56:54.30 24 seven and and Chris and and Adam's team had gone back out there and they were supposed to go
01:56:54.30 --> 01:56:58.22 from like 12 to 4 something like that I don't know what it was we gave him like a six-hour shift or
01:56:58.22 --> 01:57:03.50 something and then we were going to kind of figure out if we replace or start over we just sort of
01:57:04.38 --> 01:57:08.14 sent him out there and we're going to come back a little bit and I got to call on the radio
01:57:08.62 --> 01:57:12.78 from the battalion saying hey can you extend your angle go team out here for four hours we're going to
01:57:12.78 --> 01:57:17.18 go do another movement to do some clearing again rush of that hey Adam can you guys stay out
01:57:17.18 --> 01:57:21.90 for another couple hours you know support we're going to get you what not you know standard answer
01:57:21.90 --> 01:57:30.46 yeah Roger that no problem and during that time it was not uncommon to take fire and from that
01:57:30.46 --> 01:57:39.02 in that OP and there was some sniper fire and the first shot there was a younger marina lands
01:57:39.02 --> 01:57:44.94 corporal who was up there and Chris ran up from the other side and kind of put him down you know
01:57:44.94 --> 01:57:49.82 say hey once you get down take cover go go over the other side of the building and Chris got up
01:57:50.38 --> 01:57:56.86 to start to he was doing his observation to try to figure out what was going on and Chris was shot by
01:57:56.86 --> 01:58:04.70 sniper and I get a call kind of very closely after that from Adam you know I'm kind of man in
01:58:04.70 --> 01:58:09.18 the radio's all the time anyway even our home will base there like we're we had a radio right there
01:58:09.18 --> 01:58:14.94 so I was never really not there I was just on the radio say hey corporal landsman hit we're on a
01:58:14.94 --> 01:58:21.82 way back and I was about it I didn't have any real good sense of anything was going on and um
01:58:23.18 --> 01:58:29.18 a little panic sets in like okay and I don't want to press for too much information I get a call
01:58:29.18 --> 01:58:34.38 from alpha company who would who'd manned all the observation posts between where he was and where
01:58:34.38 --> 01:58:37.66 we were that they were clearing make sure the roads were clear they're using their tanks and
01:58:37.66 --> 01:58:41.26 their radlies so they could pick him up and bring a straight shot because that was a pretty busy
01:58:41.26 --> 01:58:46.06 dangerous road you always had to look out for ideas and stuff like that and so everybody's kind of
01:58:46.06 --> 01:58:51.66 picking up the pace to clear out that road and he's coming back and I get a call hey he's breathing
01:58:52.22 --> 01:58:58.70 we're heading straight to Charlie Med and I'm like all right okay I kind of had this sense of this
01:58:58.70 --> 01:59:06.62 is going to be okay Charlie Med is this medical facility on the the camp that we were stationed at
01:59:06.62 --> 01:59:11.66 there and was literally a hundred yards from where I slept and I just ran down to Charlie Med
01:59:11.66 --> 01:59:16.46 to meet the humbill I was there and I'm sorry it wasn't humbill it was a Bradley about the fighting
01:59:16.46 --> 01:59:24.06 vehicle Bradley pulls up myself and my my corpsman dock are there the the the Bradley has a door
01:59:24.06 --> 01:59:29.26 on the back of the body that comes down like a ramp and the ramp comes down he's on a stretcher
01:59:30.14 --> 01:59:34.22 dock goes up to get the front piece of the stretcher I'm at the bottom and he comes down
01:59:34.22 --> 01:59:39.74 carrying the stretcher and Chris is laying on the stretcher and I he went right by my look
01:59:39.74 --> 01:59:46.06 at a minute immediately that he was gone I mean it was gone it was I could see the entrance
01:59:46.06 --> 01:59:49.42 who ended the whole thing was all kind of they had stabilized and they had done their best to kind of
01:59:49.42 --> 01:59:54.62 manage the wood but there was no question that the outcome had already played itself out and Chris was
01:59:54.62 --> 02:00:00.46 gone they take a man to the medical facility which I'd been in and you've been in a dozen times
02:00:00.46 --> 02:00:05.18 for a whole host of different reasons but it always been somebody else I mean I may have known
02:00:05.18 --> 02:00:10.94 that person and been close to that person but it was always somebody else and dock goes in with
02:00:10.94 --> 02:00:14.86 him he's carrying the stretcher and he comes out and probably jack was quite 10 seconds and he just
02:00:14.86 --> 02:00:21.02 comes out with the head shaken and I knew I wasn't holding my breath or I knew but he kind of came
02:00:21.02 --> 02:00:25.50 out and and just sort of I guess confirmed if that's the word I'm looking forward to sort of
02:00:25.50 --> 02:00:36.94 made it official that that Chris had been killed and it sort of initiated just a very strange kind
02:00:36.94 --> 02:00:42.22 of very sequence of events so I I knew Adam and the rest of team were trying to get back and
02:00:42.22 --> 02:00:45.50 they're going to have a slower road back because they're not going to get the support it's just
02:00:45.50 --> 02:00:48.86 going to take a little more time going to get their gear and all the things go along with
02:00:48.86 --> 02:00:53.02 that Chris just got loaded in the humbian and racing back and Bradley they're kind of loaded up
02:00:53.02 --> 02:00:57.82 their humbians and it's just going to take some time and I know like I need to get back to the vehicle
02:00:57.82 --> 02:01:02.06 we parked our trucks because I want to meet them there and I walk back like I said it was maybe
02:01:02.06 --> 02:01:07.26 100 yards from my hooch to Charlie Man and I get about halfway there and I had this thought that
02:01:08.70 --> 02:01:15.10 that I maybe didn't confirm that Chris was killed and so I actually walked all the way back
02:01:15.10 --> 02:01:19.74 to go find there's a senior medical officer we called him the smoke really awesome guy that dealt
02:01:19.74 --> 02:01:24.62 with all the casualties there who I knew because I had done control I had controlled helicopter
02:01:24.62 --> 02:01:29.26 cast of acts on wounded folks I've been there a lot we did we get blood I mean we were in that facility
02:01:29.26 --> 02:01:39.66 all the time and I I don't know why I needed to do it but I was I I'm just I had a talk
02:01:39.66 --> 02:01:46.94 I'm gonna say is is is is is is is he is he killed is like yeah I'm sorry man you know
02:01:46.94 --> 02:01:50.70 it was kind of an odd conversation I could tell the why he was looking like why I ask him
02:01:50.70 --> 02:01:55.18 this question like it just was one of those things and I was in sort of I think it's a stage
02:01:55.18 --> 02:01:59.18 of disbelief that as I walked back and I was going to deliver the news I had sort of told
02:01:59.18 --> 02:02:03.34 myself like I can't tell them in case what if I'm wrong because I never really went through that
02:02:04.70 --> 02:02:09.74 I saw him I saw Doc but there were no words or exchange and I had this very odd like walking
02:02:09.74 --> 02:02:15.58 back and forth a couple of times and kind of sorting it out and then you know my job was
02:02:15.58 --> 02:02:20.14 next thing I had to do is I Adam I watched the trucks pull up they all get out you know four
02:02:20.14 --> 02:02:24.86 guys and everybody else had heard you know all the angle code teams that were there and we shared
02:02:24.86 --> 02:02:29.42 a facility with EOD and working with everybody you know where did it was passed something had
02:02:29.42 --> 02:02:39.90 happened and I you know a corphing on corphing on stead you know we do something called
02:02:39.90 --> 02:02:46.06 a hero flight and a hero flight is going to be like 1600 I got the information like 10 minutes
02:02:46.62 --> 02:02:52.86 the process of them bringing a casualty that casualty not surviving and then moving they had
02:02:52.86 --> 02:02:58.78 that thing wired and I'd seen it done a bunch of times but it just it was Chris it was my guy
02:02:58.78 --> 02:03:02.14 he was a guy that I just knew differently than everybody else I just saw him differently
02:03:02.78 --> 02:03:07.02 when we entered our trucks he was the back left and I was the front right and our trucks are always
02:03:07.02 --> 02:03:11.82 parked back into their spots so they're always side by side so the back left of his truck
02:03:11.82 --> 02:03:17.34 entered door and the right front of my truck door we always had a fight space for each other
02:03:17.90 --> 02:03:22.14 you know Chris was a standard perfect Marine like he could be 90% of the way through if he
02:03:22.14 --> 02:03:25.50 saw me walking up he'd get out of the way close the door to let me in on my cockman dude like just
02:03:25.50 --> 02:03:31.74 he was a great Marine just I walked past that kid without even really talking him you know a thousand
02:03:31.74 --> 02:03:41.98 times just every single day a couple of times a day and it demystifies as a Marine
02:03:44.06 --> 02:03:49.50 you just live a slightly bit for me I shouldn't say you how it felt for me as I just felt
02:03:50.22 --> 02:03:54.30 with all that was going on and all the destruction and the death and the violence and all the
02:03:54.30 --> 02:03:58.54 things that I'd sort of become accustomed to at that point there's just an aspect of it that's just
02:03:58.54 --> 02:04:04.62 a tiny bit insulated in your life to a really small degree but it's enough to just keep you
02:04:04.62 --> 02:04:14.30 sort of preserved and when Chris was killed it just sort of exposed that it broke down one of my
02:04:14.30 --> 02:04:21.50 last little boundary of I'm I'm okay here because I can do this because I'm gonna get through this I'm
02:04:21.50 --> 02:04:32.38 gonna go home and everything's gonna be okay and that hurt a lot that hurt in ways that I did not
02:04:32.38 --> 02:04:38.38 understand how it was gonna hurt I just didn't I just didn't know what that was gonna be like
02:04:39.74 --> 02:04:44.62 and the the all those next steps and you I know you know this because you you saw it
02:04:44.62 --> 02:04:51.26 he's on a helicopter and he's gone flying away in that 46 in what feels like about a minute
02:04:51.26 --> 02:04:57.74 it's ours and our even rehearsed the movement onto the to carry him onto the hell but
02:04:58.54 --> 02:05:02.22 you go from Chris's city is on his way into watching the helicopter fly away and it feels like
02:05:02.22 --> 02:05:07.90 it takes about that long and then you're just sort of left and you walk back you literally walk away
02:05:07.90 --> 02:05:11.50 from the medical facility where the helicopter just takes off and you walk back on to your original
02:05:11.50 --> 02:05:17.74 you just go back to your room only Chris has gone and it's like that whole deployment kind of
02:05:17.74 --> 02:05:22.22 re I don't know what the right word is it's like I had to start the deployment again because
02:05:22.22 --> 02:05:25.50 all the things that I was dealing with and all things that I was managing and leading is as
02:05:25.50 --> 02:05:31.34 it's a leader would know whatever you want to say was my job it all is sort of change in terms of
02:05:32.14 --> 02:05:40.06 what I thought really well the guys that I was working with everything was different now because it was
02:05:40.06 --> 02:05:45.58 their brother that was gone not somebody else and it's just sort of changed the calculus and
02:05:45.58 --> 02:05:52.22 it really redefined the rest of that deployment and I'll be really really blunt it was hard for me
02:05:53.18 --> 02:05:58.78 to not fold and there was a lot of instinct of like I do not want to do this anymore I do not want
02:05:58.78 --> 02:06:04.30 to be here this is more than I had bargained for and this we can laugh about volunteering and
02:06:04.30 --> 02:06:11.42 being a Marie you know it was a little more than I bargained for and look man we had done some crazy
02:06:11.42 --> 02:06:15.74 stuff at that point and I'd seen some bad things happen I was a participant in some bad things
02:06:16.70 --> 02:06:22.14 and I was okay I was doing okay and I was gonna be okay with that and this one just sort of
02:06:23.66 --> 02:06:28.30 I just it's I struggled with it a little bit so it was a tough day man
02:06:28.30 --> 02:06:37.66 yeah and obviously you know for for us it was you know what a month and a half later
02:06:38.46 --> 02:06:43.74 on August 2nd when Mark got killed and you know I think that's one of the things that
02:06:44.78 --> 02:06:49.26 that we felt you know that little bit of insulation that you're talking about
02:06:50.78 --> 02:06:57.26 we felt that we felt I would say I would say actually more insulated because
02:06:57.26 --> 02:07:03.18 you know my guys were out there taking massive risks getting in crazy gun fights
02:07:03.98 --> 02:07:09.26 getting after it to a degree that no one had ever thought they would and we were doing all right we
02:07:09.26 --> 02:07:14.38 had a couple guys get wounded here and there but they were okay and honestly that guys getting wounded
02:07:14.38 --> 02:07:20.62 you know it's not a devastating wound I mean I had you know one of my guys got wounded early on and
02:07:20.62 --> 02:07:25.58 he almost lost his leg but guess what he didn't and that that didn't make us feel more vulnerable
02:07:25.58 --> 02:07:31.66 in my mind it made us feel stronger and like hey we might get wounded but what we're gonna be good
02:07:32.30 --> 02:07:36.30 and so yeah when Mark got killed and especially Mark who was you know such a
02:07:36.94 --> 02:07:43.26 gargarius and such a guy so full of life that you don't think he can be killed you don't think
02:07:43.26 --> 02:07:49.66 he can be killed and same thing you know that insulation was just completely shattered and I think
02:07:49.66 --> 02:08:00.06 what was also it was it was recognizable it was recognizable to me was that other people outside of
02:08:00.06 --> 02:08:07.74 task munibrusor they fought the same thing they fought hey the seals are here they're gonna they're
02:08:07.74 --> 02:08:12.30 they're gonna they're gonna push through this they're gonna they're gonna win and there nothing's
02:08:12.30 --> 02:08:18.62 gonna happen to them and we saw it you know at the memorial service you could see in guys faces that
02:08:18.62 --> 02:08:27.10 they were they were also their insulation about us was was kind of shattered too and then it
02:08:27.10 --> 02:08:34.14 turns into damn if the seals can get killed where am I at I think that was another thing that
02:08:34.14 --> 02:08:37.90 that really you know that was another thing that really just made Mark get and killed such a
02:08:38.62 --> 02:08:44.94 such an impact to all of us there there's no doubt that what you just said is exactly how
02:08:44.94 --> 02:08:51.98 it played out you were the first guy to talk to me when Chris's helicopter flies away it's
02:08:51.98 --> 02:08:56.46 literally dusty and you know the helicopter's loud and it kicks up dust there and it was dark it was
02:08:56.46 --> 02:09:02.38 nighttime and you came up to me and I don't remember the exact words but we were just turning around
02:09:02.38 --> 02:09:07.02 and walking back and you said something like we're gonna get after this guys and we're gonna
02:09:07.02 --> 02:09:11.74 go find the cybersitter doing this something to those wars and it was basically like we're
02:09:11.74 --> 02:09:19.58 gonna take care of this and I remember feeling really comforted by that like yeah man yeah go do
02:09:19.58 --> 02:09:25.34 that that's awesome and feeling good about that that we weren't helpless and we're just gonna
02:09:25.34 --> 02:09:30.54 suck it up and deal with this just this terrible loss that we're gonna get something from this
02:09:30.54 --> 02:09:36.14 we're gonna go find some guys and go get after it and we're gonna go kill these guys and you
02:09:36.14 --> 02:09:41.42 guys we're gonna you guys are gonna make that happen and I remember feeling I remember how that
02:09:41.42 --> 02:09:47.10 felt and look June 20th August 2nd just like everything else was a blur man it was like
02:09:47.10 --> 02:09:52.70 it might as well just been the next day because things happened so fast there and I was
02:09:53.98 --> 02:09:58.70 you know I wasn't on the patrol on the on August 2nd but I was on the radio I was
02:09:58.70 --> 02:10:02.46 got to run in the air I was doing all the same stuff we always did you know and I was back in
02:10:02.46 --> 02:10:08.38 the CUC with you working that mission all that stuff that happened and before you know it we're
02:10:08.38 --> 02:10:16.38 watching that helicopter fly away you know or he's gone you know and you and you're seeing
02:10:16.38 --> 02:10:21.02 the the the aftermath of that and I actually went back last night to look at my journal entry
02:10:21.02 --> 02:10:26.06 for that day because I ended up running down Charlie Medigan because that's where everybody came in
02:10:26.06 --> 02:10:29.42 and I remember seeing Lave there you know Lave was a guy I don't work with the ton and
02:10:29.42 --> 02:10:32.70 there he is he's got a wound I'm looking at him over I'm saying over as I told her they kind of
02:10:32.70 --> 02:10:39.98 shirt off they're they're they're attending to Lave who was Lave was a larger than life
02:10:40.54 --> 02:10:44.54 you know for guy like me who always kind of fell to a little bit like what the hell am I doing
02:10:44.54 --> 02:10:50.86 her man without my doing with the seals like this isn't sane these guys are just they're just
02:10:50.86 --> 02:10:59.50 larger than life and to see the exposure of that it bothered me and I knew I had the feeling of
02:10:59.50 --> 02:11:05.42 holy cow if this can happen to these guys you know can happen any of us and it's not a good
02:11:05.42 --> 02:11:08.46 feeling and when you saw the guys from the team who it was just it was just everything was
02:11:08.46 --> 02:11:12.46 scrambling and it was just that sense of and I don't want to make a sound like it wasn't
02:11:12.46 --> 02:11:17.34 a pain nobody's panicking or freaking out it was not like that but it was just a tiny bit
02:11:18.06 --> 02:11:23.26 chaotic that makes sense on a small degree but enough when you were so used to just being
02:11:23.26 --> 02:11:30.62 completely not like that that feeling like when Chris loss was it what I felt was like
02:11:31.58 --> 02:11:36.86 oh man I'm not really in good chill any of this I am not in control all that stuff that I've told
02:11:36.86 --> 02:11:42.70 myself all that comfort and confidence and we're getting better and I'm gonna be more effective
02:11:42.70 --> 02:11:49.98 and do more good work until the thing is over it was like no negative that could be you that could
02:11:49.98 --> 02:12:00.14 happen today and then it and between Chris and Mark the army suffered oh I'm God bless we
02:12:00.14 --> 02:12:04.62 are going to memorials like every couple of days people are getting killed all the time and
02:12:04.62 --> 02:12:10.22 everyone of those you wrote that that confidence a little bit and when it happened to Mark and
02:12:10.22 --> 02:12:20.14 Dave that was hard to see that and it that was the feeling that I had it was like yeah
02:12:23.50 --> 02:12:27.58 maybe I'm just lucky you know maybe I maybe this whole thing is just luck
02:12:29.42 --> 02:12:39.26 now look we we regrouped I mean June 20th was a bad day you know we did all the things
02:12:39.26 --> 02:12:44.78 we did the morning we paid our our we ordered him the right way you guys can't we did it the right way and we
02:12:44.78 --> 02:12:52.86 acknowledged Chris but if you kind of think what's gone in the middle of June man there was no
02:12:52.86 --> 02:12:57.42 taken a knee there was no like let's hold off for a second catcher breath the bullet chain was just
02:12:57.42 --> 02:13:00.78 running and as a matter of fact it was just gonna it was actually just gonna get a ton worse you remember
02:13:00.78 --> 02:13:06.62 July and August were just they were insane they were insane so we we lost Chris really at the
02:13:06.62 --> 02:13:11.02 big ramp up you know we had done a big movement in earlier in June and we were really starting
02:13:11.02 --> 02:13:16.70 to lay into the city but the real you know the crazy jay block you know that kind of stuff all
02:13:16.70 --> 02:13:22.38 that stuff was all out in front of us and so for me it was you know my entire career I've done a
02:13:22.38 --> 02:13:27.58 whole bunch of really great stuff in my career and nothing is even nothing is even it's not anymore talking
02:13:27.58 --> 02:13:33.34 about what anything else in my career has meant compared to that deployment and then that day I mean
02:13:33.34 --> 02:13:40.78 it's just light years different and it was like you gotta get up and go do it the very next
02:13:40.78 --> 02:13:45.66 day and it's a remember going that first patrol that first mission and trying to that feeling of
02:13:46.78 --> 02:13:50.54 okay yeah it's different and you got I think you've got one of two ways to go with that it's either
02:13:50.54 --> 02:13:54.22 gonna get inside your heading kind of mess with you and break you a little bit and and I could feel
02:13:54.22 --> 02:14:00.86 that happening or you just you just you just don't you just shut it down and just go do it
02:14:00.86 --> 02:14:07.26 and I found how to compartmentalize you know I'd come back I'd have moments when I was back
02:14:07.26 --> 02:14:10.78 on my whoochup and the roof by myself I have my moments man no I don't want anybody to think
02:14:10.78 --> 02:14:15.98 that I didn't I had plenty of those moments this is matter fact I I still do to be honest with you
02:14:15.98 --> 02:14:19.98 I still have my moments I go visit Chris her allington on his birthday I go visit Chris and
02:14:19.98 --> 02:14:25.50 that day he was killed I go to visit Chris Memorial Day his mom comes out I see cat she and I
02:14:25.50 --> 02:14:33.82 were very close I have my moments without a doubt but the rest of the three months in Ramadi
02:14:33.82 --> 02:14:38.94 there was just not there wasn't a ton of time to do that so I guess I kind of just saved it
02:14:38.94 --> 02:14:46.62 maybe for for when I came back and it it was there I mean it it's not good but yeah man
02:14:46.62 --> 02:14:57.18 so then you you do come back I mean obviously like you said it ramped up it ramped up all the time
02:14:57.18 --> 02:15:02.86 and the guys were just you know everybody like I'm not just talking about our guys I'm talking
02:15:02.86 --> 02:15:09.98 about everybody it ramped up hardcore it got hotter outside the the the combat got more intense
02:15:09.98 --> 02:15:20.38 the enemy started fighting harder they got more square away and like you said you and the rest of
02:15:20.38 --> 02:15:30.78 the guys there did the mission day after day night after night and then one day you fly home
02:15:30.78 --> 02:15:40.38 yeah and how was that transition for you getting back to the states
02:15:43.10 --> 02:15:49.50 interesting it was an interesting transition so from the time that I left Ramadi
02:15:50.62 --> 02:15:54.30 so you would pack up our stuff we left Ramadi I think we weren't to co-8 for day or two
02:15:54.30 --> 02:16:02.46 went to Lujoon went to Japan because I had to check out both places Jack I think it was six days
02:16:02.46 --> 02:16:06.78 on the calendar from the day I left Ramadi to the day I landed on a plane in San Diego
02:16:08.62 --> 02:16:12.94 which at the time was all I wanted I was the and I've been fairly good about this right my
02:16:12.94 --> 02:16:18.38 career is when I want things to happen administratively I can make those things happen
02:16:18.38 --> 02:16:23.42 but if I catch one that there's a flight from Japan to San Diego and I can get on that flight
02:16:23.42 --> 02:16:26.78 I'm gonna get on that flight even if my CEO is the young me like how did you get out of here so fast
02:16:26.78 --> 02:16:31.26 like I have the same in the guy in the paper and I got to go and I'm out I wanted to get out quickly
02:16:31.66 --> 02:16:37.42 so I found myself in San Diego executing my next orders which the Marine Corps said you go to
02:16:37.42 --> 02:16:41.34 Ramadi you do the fact you're gonna do the fact you're gonna go back to San Diego from there
02:16:42.06 --> 02:16:47.34 which will be your next at order so I knew while I was in Iraq that San Diego was in my future my wife had
02:16:47.34 --> 02:16:51.18 already moved down there I told you she was living with my best friend Neil who was on that
02:16:51.18 --> 02:16:57.74 fact tour before me so I go in Ramadi his battalion comes home we show up my wife and my best friend
02:16:57.74 --> 02:17:02.78 and living together in San Diego which was really good for her because he was able to kind of
02:17:03.66 --> 02:17:08.46 keep her aware of what's going on but knew exactly how to explain it in a way that wasn't
02:17:08.46 --> 02:17:13.42 gonna freak her out and he also took it out so he knew how to downplay hey I would call hey we're
02:17:13.42 --> 02:17:17.58 doing this no big deal I mean I didn't I wasn't telling him half of what the hell was going on I
02:17:17.58 --> 02:17:22.46 wouldn't you not gonna share those stories so he was a really great resource for her I paid very
02:17:22.46 --> 02:17:26.62 little time worrying about it to be honest with you I was comfortable that she had a good
02:17:27.18 --> 02:17:34.70 support structure which she really didn't we we got married I deployed four months later to Ramadi
02:17:34.70 --> 02:17:37.82 she she started dating a dude who was driving a Corvette and living in Tahoe as a top
02:17:37.82 --> 02:17:44.06 owner structure and and four months after we got married I was in Ramadi so there was no like
02:17:44.06 --> 02:17:49.74 easing so I knew there was just I didn't know at the time didn't think of it but it was
02:17:49.74 --> 02:17:54.70 obvious that looking back that she was just thrown into an environment that she was totally unprepared for
02:17:56.30 --> 02:17:59.34 now forget about just me being gone but just the fact that I was in Ramadi and it's all over
02:17:59.34 --> 02:18:02.14 the news everybody knew it was going on I think one of my Marines is killing me a lot of crazy
02:18:02.14 --> 02:18:07.10 stuff going on and next thing you know I'm home September 28 I'm back in San Diego like
02:18:07.10 --> 02:18:13.90 three hundred sixty five days to the day I'm home and I checked into an F-18 squadron like the
02:18:13.90 --> 02:18:20.94 day after I got home before October 1st I was back into an F-18 squadron San Diego which is insane
02:18:23.26 --> 02:18:30.22 and I to be really blunt I was you know all those guys in Anglican went back to Anglican
02:18:30.78 --> 02:18:35.34 and can't push you in can't handsome in in Japan I was like later bros you know like
02:18:35.34 --> 02:18:41.90 no longer buys you know high five great deployment you know I'm out I was just on other things
02:18:41.90 --> 02:18:45.66 and I kind of extricated myself it's you know I fall the rules I do whatever supposed to do and
02:18:45.66 --> 02:18:51.82 before I know it I'm back there and I honestly I think also kind of kidding myself like that was
02:18:51.82 --> 02:18:58.06 the best thing for me let's get home I knew something was a on this because on the drive home
02:18:58.06 --> 02:19:04.54 from the airport I find a San Diego international just down the road my wife and my my mom who lives in
02:19:04.54 --> 02:19:08.14 San Diego both of them came to pick me up from the airport you've already met my mom great lady
02:19:08.14 --> 02:19:11.74 my wife and my mom picked me up from the airport I got pictures of them meeting me there
02:19:11.74 --> 02:19:17.98 getting the car drive from San Diego international to our house in Pacific Beach and as we're
02:19:17.98 --> 02:19:27.82 pulling like on to Chelsea any up to the house I like screamed at them told them stop talking
02:19:27.82 --> 02:19:31.74 or something like that I said something like I don't even I don't know what it was but I
02:19:31.74 --> 02:19:36.78 think I just remember sitting in the passenger seat and some the gears just start I'm in a truck
02:19:36.78 --> 02:19:40.78 or a car I like whenever I don't know what it was but something's going on and I think just
02:19:40.78 --> 02:19:44.70 the pressure is building and I'm and I have no sense of what's going on I know out of for it
02:19:44.70 --> 02:19:51.02 and they're like having a perfectly normal adult conversation that might have been an octave above
02:19:51.02 --> 02:19:56.54 when I was willing to accept her tolerate maybe and I completely freaked out on my wife and my
02:19:56.54 --> 02:20:02.46 mom let's see in the year and you know they were like oh sorry you know they were super cool no push back
02:20:02.46 --> 02:20:10.14 and it was an indicator like yeah you recognize that immediately like oh god yeah immediately
02:20:10.14 --> 02:20:18.14 and it was that combination recognition of that's not good and clearly I have I have things I
02:20:18.14 --> 02:20:23.66 need to deal with that I wasn't quite aware of so I knew no question right away and I think
02:20:23.66 --> 02:20:28.46 about this a lot with other marines and the things you experience in combat you've talked about
02:20:28.46 --> 02:20:33.26 PTSD a lot look that's the subject you could spend hours on the bottom lines everybody deals with
02:20:33.26 --> 02:20:37.66 things differently doesn't mean you're broken or messed it just it just means you have some
02:20:37.66 --> 02:20:41.82 process you gotta go through and you gotta deal with them we all deal with it differently I had
02:20:41.82 --> 02:20:47.90 maybe talk myself into out 33 as fairly experienced guy I was surrounded by very young marines
02:20:47.90 --> 02:20:55.74 who maybe in my mind didn't have maybe the emotional maturity maybe the life skills to maybe
02:20:55.74 --> 02:21:01.18 manage some of these same chaotic things you know guys at saw Chris get shot you know I maybe kind
02:21:01.18 --> 02:21:05.90 of built myself up a little bit as a little better equipped and I was better equipped in my mind
02:21:05.90 --> 02:21:11.58 and I was I in a matter of 45 minutes from the airport to the house I'm flying off the handle
02:21:11.58 --> 02:21:19.66 on something so it just all it was man it was it was those two things like that's not good
02:21:20.46 --> 02:21:24.14 and this is gonna probably happen again I'm gonna need to I'm gonna need to think about this I
02:21:24.14 --> 02:21:29.02 can't pretend like I'm not gonna just have some sort of residual you can't leave Ramadi
02:21:29.02 --> 02:21:32.70 being San Diego six days later and not bring some baggage home with you and I was bringing some
02:21:32.70 --> 02:21:43.58 baggage home and there's some baggage there a little bit so that transition was was it started
02:21:43.58 --> 02:21:48.22 is there anything that like anything that helped you yeah dude I'll tell you what helped the most
02:21:48.22 --> 02:21:54.86 is my best friend who had been in Ramadi and endured all of that loss the look our story you know
02:21:54.86 --> 02:21:59.42 the the guys that we replaced the guys that replaced us it's a very similar story a lot they understand
02:21:59.42 --> 02:22:04.46 that you know I think having an outlet having one other dude it happened to be my best friend
02:22:04.46 --> 02:22:10.06 super 14 so it was you want to talk about just hitting the jackpot and being the best equipped
02:22:10.06 --> 02:22:14.30 sort of just deal and power through it and and and accept what's going on and and embrace it and
02:22:14.30 --> 02:22:19.34 all those things that go on with it I had an outlet man I had my best friend who I mean he knew
02:22:19.34 --> 02:22:24.46 every place we were I mean it wasn't even like oh he was here now it was the same place yeah
02:22:24.46 --> 02:22:28.38 because Ramadi's not that big it's just not that big man and so we say I was on the corner
02:22:28.38 --> 02:22:35.50 of sunset mission is like yeah there are 500 times yeah and and he was struggling a little bit
02:22:35.50 --> 02:22:41.42 too you know again I it's all relative I mean we're handled it relatively okay you know I'm going
02:22:41.42 --> 02:22:45.42 back to kind of dealing in normal life and but the moment when you get those little spikes and those
02:22:45.42 --> 02:22:49.58 is what kind of comes up and get you those little spikes was a sort of unforeseen kind of reactions
02:22:50.30 --> 02:22:53.90 he could see that in me and I could see that in him we had actually been really we're really good
02:22:53.90 --> 02:22:58.78 for each other when I see him kind of get a little shaky a little break like I'm not you know he's
02:22:58.78 --> 02:23:02.86 not digging his environment a little bit or he'd see that of me you had that other person I kind
02:23:02.86 --> 02:23:09.66 of bring you back to helping you helping you deal with that which is good the flip side of that
02:23:09.66 --> 02:23:15.82 while it was really helpful for him to be there I think it was really tough on Whitney because she
02:23:15.82 --> 02:23:21.02 was not my outlet for that I wasn't kind of got cut out totally and not I didn't certainly not
02:23:21.02 --> 02:23:25.50 by design I'm not like doing this calculation if I don't want my head she's not I'm not going to
02:23:25.50 --> 02:23:28.86 use her as a resource you know for that and to be honest with you too there's also a little part
02:23:28.86 --> 02:23:34.70 of you know what the corner of Michigan sunset is like so totally man and I'll I'll be really
02:23:34.70 --> 02:23:41.10 candid you know I I think I would have been almost embarrassed is maybe not the right word but I
02:23:41.10 --> 02:23:46.86 I wasn't I don't know if I wanted to see that part of it you know I mean like hey they check
02:23:46.86 --> 02:23:49.98 at this ridiculous of own vulnerability that I have right now that I'm going to carry with me
02:23:49.98 --> 02:23:53.66 for God that was how long that's going to come up I didn't know where and you're going to have
02:23:53.66 --> 02:23:58.54 to just deal with it so there was a I think the thing that bothered me the most and was part of
02:23:58.54 --> 02:24:03.74 just kind of getting back to day to day life was it I would get when things didn't go well when
02:24:03.74 --> 02:24:09.18 I had my moments my irrational is just I just get pissed off it was that feeling of so you I have this
02:24:09.18 --> 02:24:14.06 like some event would happen something stupid would catch my attention and kind of height my
02:24:14.06 --> 02:24:19.90 you know my response and because it happened I'd be annoyed myself that I let it that I let it
02:24:19.90 --> 02:24:24.46 bother me and then I'd be pissed off of myself because I let it bother me you know me like this ridiculous
02:24:24.46 --> 02:24:29.98 cycle of I told you the story the other day my wife and I shoot I guarantee you she remembers
02:24:29.98 --> 02:24:35.82 this tour we're walking across the street downtown no no by the beat I think and an auto body
02:24:35.82 --> 02:24:40.38 shop is running the the air drill to pull some tires off I can root you know that kind of sound
02:24:41.26 --> 02:24:47.10 and as we're walking I think my left arm is over her her shoulder we're walking like this
02:24:47.10 --> 02:24:51.98 I hear that sound and my first reaction is I've pushed her down to the ground and in the time that it
02:24:51.98 --> 02:24:58.62 takes to do that and catch that it's happening is maybe a third of a second you know what I mean
02:24:58.62 --> 02:25:04.30 so I hear it I do the I'm I'm reacting and pushing her to the ground I'm kind of getting on top of
02:25:04.30 --> 02:25:10.70 her to do look what up to oh that's the car it's not a thing there's no reason for you to do this
02:25:10.70 --> 02:25:15.66 is about a third of a second and what bothered me the most about it is that I did it not that I
02:25:15.66 --> 02:25:20.06 felt like that is it I reacted to it and I was like embarrassed like what's wrong with me to
02:25:20.06 --> 02:25:26.22 to go through that and she's like what the you know and I it sounded like you know and kind
02:25:26.22 --> 02:25:31.10 of going through the whole thing and I think just the the fact that I had responses pissed me off
02:25:31.10 --> 02:25:36.06 and I would just kind of honestly I have a temper about it and that was she got to see me just
02:25:36.06 --> 02:25:42.46 get pissed off itself for no real good reason which you never really get pissed off like I mean
02:25:42.46 --> 02:25:47.26 I have tempered some pictures stuff that just I would get mad about stuff that just didn't make sense
02:25:47.26 --> 02:25:52.62 I mean I have a temper about things that my computer pisses me off just like it pisses you off
02:25:52.62 --> 02:25:57.82 man that's totally normal right I would get I would have reactions to stuff that just there was
02:25:57.82 --> 02:26:02.30 no way for her to say oh that makes sense I understand it would just be this totally odd ball
02:26:03.58 --> 02:26:07.74 somebody would say something wrong just it would just trigger in ways that she would look at me
02:26:07.74 --> 02:26:12.30 and kind of be like who are you she knew all my flaws she knew everything right along with me and
02:26:12.30 --> 02:26:17.18 all of a sudden now I'm doing all of those stuff for another little thing in the mix so I got my
02:26:17.18 --> 02:26:21.98 wife who we get married I leave a go on this diploma and I come back I'm home for maybe seven
02:26:21.98 --> 02:26:29.26 months before I deploy again in that seven months you know welcome to marriage to Dave Burke you
02:26:29.26 --> 02:26:33.10 know that involves a year long deployment seven months and I rack you know
02:26:33.10 --> 02:26:37.10 God oh knows what the hell I was you know I'm back to work so I'm back at a squadron as the
02:26:37.10 --> 02:26:43.02 exo you know work in ridiculous exo hours in a fighter squadron prepping to go into deployment
02:26:43.02 --> 02:26:49.98 I I voluntarily extend my time to make the deployment which is exactly what you should do at the
02:26:49.98 --> 02:26:54.86 beginning of your marriage is volunteer to extend on a deployment I got accepted into grad school
02:26:54.86 --> 02:26:59.02 I was going to go to Dartmouth I was getting out of the Marine Corps I was going to go to get my MBA
02:26:59.02 --> 02:27:06.30 and I remember the conversation of hey I'm going to extend ask me to extend and you know
02:27:06.30 --> 02:27:10.70 as explaining why I was going to do what I was going to do and she's like why why would you do that
02:27:10.70 --> 02:27:17.82 and I said so I can deploy and you hear those words like god did I just say that to my wife like
02:27:19.18 --> 02:27:24.06 which is so I cannot be with you so I can be apart from you so I can hang out the boys and go do that
02:27:24.06 --> 02:27:28.06 you know I mean not retire from the ring you've got to know the Marine Corps so I can not do all these
02:27:28.06 --> 02:27:32.06 other things that I'm not set up this future that I told you all about and so do you on totally
02:27:32.70 --> 02:27:38.94 so to say that my wife and and everybody's got those stories the laundry list of reasons why she
02:27:38.94 --> 02:27:43.98 should have just sort of cut bait and be like no this is not happening is a lot longer than
02:27:43.98 --> 02:27:50.46 the list of reasons why she shouldn't have and props were good she's here and my marriage with her
02:27:51.26 --> 02:27:55.18 you know for all the ups and downs it goes on get everybody's marriage the one thing I don't worry
02:27:55.18 --> 02:28:01.02 about even even when we're at our worst at our absolute worst which our worst is whatever it is we have
02:28:01.02 --> 02:28:06.62 our worst moments at our absolute worst I don't have a shred and have a brain cell of thought of
02:28:06.62 --> 02:28:10.30 I wonder if our marriage is going to survive this you know this throat animal having over god knows
02:28:10.30 --> 02:28:17.66 what you know so we hit kind of went through the fire there and she she got forged yeah big time
02:28:17.66 --> 02:28:22.94 she's a stud she deserves mad props for going through that because I'm not really sure why she did
02:28:22.94 --> 02:28:30.06 to be honest with you she said you know what I can't come up with a good reason to go she had a lot of
02:28:30.06 --> 02:28:36.22 options on the table I'm not sure yeah so it was that transition was tough man you so now you're
02:28:36.22 --> 02:28:40.22 in another squadron you go on to point me again which is another what what are you doing on that
02:28:40.22 --> 02:28:44.78 deployment just more so I'm back in an F-18 squadron on the exo and the opposite I actually did
02:28:44.78 --> 02:28:48.62 both jobs on this deployment we just go to Japan it's a Westtime okay Western Pacific we're back
02:28:48.62 --> 02:28:54.78 in Iwakuni and and Ocanala just doing yeah exercise exercise training I kind of stuff
02:28:54.78 --> 02:28:58.78 get done with that and so now maybe it's time to get out of the Marine Corps before I left
02:28:58.78 --> 02:29:02.70 on that deployment I had told my commander the group commander and the squadron commander hey
02:29:02.70 --> 02:29:07.10 this is it for me I'm hanging it up it's been awesome I happily to extend for this deployment
02:29:07.10 --> 02:29:10.22 that they need to me to go on I was great experience I got to train a bunch of young guys
02:29:10.94 --> 02:29:14.86 life was good but they knew before I left that I was going to be out of the Marine Corps
02:29:14.86 --> 02:29:19.18 at the end of that I deferred at Dartmouth for a year paid my non-refundable deposit which I
02:29:19.18 --> 02:29:23.74 have never gotten back it wasn't that's why they call it non-refundable right absolutely
02:29:24.30 --> 02:29:29.10 there oh my point I wasn't kicking around the idea of getting out I was in full execution we had
02:29:29.10 --> 02:29:34.38 looked at houses like we were in execution this was merely a detour to get to that end state
02:29:35.58 --> 02:29:39.90 and what I'm doing back from that deployment in January I think it is of the following year
02:29:39.90 --> 02:29:48.38 and it it turns out that the Marine Corps wants to send a guy to go fly F-22s for the
02:29:48.38 --> 02:29:54.06 with the year force for three years and they're accepting applications for the F-22 Raptor
02:29:54.06 --> 02:29:58.14 Exchange which had never been happened before never happened since there was a one time thing
02:29:58.70 --> 02:30:04.70 and the guy got it they picked you know it was going to go to non-deploying in NLS and fly the F-22
02:30:04.70 --> 02:30:11.42 Raptor should properly apply I guess it seems like a reasonable thing to do because if they say no then
02:30:11.42 --> 02:30:18.54 yeah I'll just go to play I'll go get my MBA it's all good and Lone Behold at the end of December
02:30:18.54 --> 02:30:25.50 I get the word that I got picked up for this Raptor Exchange and I remember calling it
02:30:25.50 --> 02:30:36.62 in my head and I did the standard day work over sell hey no deploying we're going to go to you know
02:30:36.62 --> 02:30:41.42 it's all there's all the goodness there's no downside you know and she's like shut up you know
02:30:41.42 --> 02:30:46.86 she's and she was good with it you know it was it was it was just another one of those things like
02:30:46.86 --> 02:30:50.94 I can't say no to this this is just something that doesn't happen and you just don't get to
02:30:50.94 --> 02:30:55.74 nobody gets to fly the F-22 in the Marine Corps because the Marine Corps is a fly of 22
02:30:55.74 --> 02:30:59.50 same thing I said when I flew F-16's in Top Gun and all this sort of stuff so it was just
02:30:59.50 --> 02:31:04.62 another thing that I just couldn't believe was happening and I couldn't leave the Marine Corps
02:31:04.62 --> 02:31:09.58 saying I walked away from that I just couldn't and she was totally unbored and okay moment
02:31:10.38 --> 02:31:16.70 didn't get back my non-refundable deposit and uh move the Vegas and start to fly in the F-22 Raptor
02:31:16.70 --> 02:31:22.62 three years up there and then at some point that roll this door oh yeah and that rolls into the F-35
02:31:22.62 --> 02:31:28.94 at some point so I'm fine we're F-22's how many people were flying the F-22 at this point
02:31:29.98 --> 02:31:35.82 so we probably had I knew at the time what number I was I think I might have been
02:31:37.18 --> 02:31:43.26 in the 100 something you know we had two squadrons that were stood up you know and it was
02:31:43.26 --> 02:31:47.50 starting to pick up the pace was early 2008 so the Raptor was just starting to get its legs
02:31:47.50 --> 02:31:51.02 underneath it was starting to building more and it was starting to become a thing and the Marine
02:31:51.02 --> 02:31:54.70 Corps had this idea that they're gonna they're gonna build this new stealth airplane called the F-35
02:31:54.70 --> 02:31:59.58 and they're gonna get it and they wanted somebody to go to the Air Force to learn all the
02:31:59.58 --> 02:32:03.82 airplanes are really similar there's a goal still all their experience and all the pain that they've
02:32:03.82 --> 02:32:07.42 gone through to stand up this thing and then you're gonna bring it back to the Marine Corps so the
02:32:07.42 --> 02:32:12.46 deal was this F-22 gig was it was really high probability I was gonna go right from the F-22 to the F-35
02:32:12.46 --> 02:32:17.98 and command the first operational squadron and the lone-boiled man that's exactly what happened we
02:32:17.98 --> 02:32:22.38 went to Tindall we lived in Tindall for three months when I went through training and
02:32:23.18 --> 02:32:26.70 that was awesome we were living on the beach in Florida for three months it get trained in the
02:32:26.70 --> 02:32:32.70 Raptor we moved out to Vegas lived there for three plus years started a family to my first two kids
02:32:32.70 --> 02:32:38.38 were born in Las Vegas we were we're killing it man I mean it was awesome and as I'm getting
02:32:38.38 --> 02:32:44.62 ready to leave Vegas I get selected to command the first operational there was a guy there before
02:32:44.62 --> 02:32:48.86 they didn't have airplanes they had a guy there was another seal before me but I was gonna go out
02:32:48.86 --> 02:32:53.26 there and accept and start flying the first F-35's the Marine Corps I show up and this poor guy
02:32:53.26 --> 02:32:58.54 was selected to do the same thing the two years prior great dude but you know we'd stayed in touch
02:32:58.54 --> 02:33:03.10 and we were always in contact and helping them stand up with everything and and I get there
02:33:03.10 --> 02:33:08.62 Jacob I'm there I think two days and the first airplane showed up and I'm like what's the
02:33:09.58 --> 02:33:14.54 what's the big deal he spent two years in CSing airplane working I'm there all this paper work
02:33:14.54 --> 02:33:18.38 grinding doing all this has been a straight stuff to prep he gets nowhere plans use you up two days
02:33:18.38 --> 02:33:22.46 that are boom did the amount of work that him and his guys went through to stand up the squadron
02:33:22.46 --> 02:33:27.58 I literally showed up at the work in the next day the first airplane landed yeah that's my new
02:33:27.58 --> 02:33:33.42 nickname for you like this really isn't that hard man what's the big deal and and he and I did a turn
02:33:33.42 --> 02:33:41.02 over and he left and sort of flying up 35's and you know that's a whole part of my career we
02:33:41.02 --> 02:33:46.06 could spend hours on that but I flew the rapture which was an amazing airplane and I flew the
02:33:46.06 --> 02:33:53.18 35 which was an amazing airplane and I got to totally be relevant in aviation I had sort of exhausted
02:33:53.98 --> 02:33:57.02 I did all the things I wanted to do in the Hornet I loved that airplane I did top
02:33:57.02 --> 02:34:01.90 and I kind of had reached all the things and we talked about this too when when you leave top gun
02:34:03.10 --> 02:34:08.62 you're never going to be that good ever again so it's just a matter of how slow you can make the
02:34:08.62 --> 02:34:14.14 process of getting worse it's just how can you slow it down to be as good as you can knowing
02:34:14.14 --> 02:34:17.90 that you will never be as good as you were there because you're just you're never going to get the
02:34:17.90 --> 02:34:22.86 reps again ever you're just never going to get it and so it's just a matter of kind of slowing
02:34:22.86 --> 02:34:27.02 down that process and at some point in your mind like I don't want to be in this business if I'm not
02:34:27.02 --> 02:34:34.54 at the top of my game when I flew the I have 22 I didn't have a job I didn't I wasn't I wasn't the
02:34:34.54 --> 02:34:37.42 absolute of a squadron which is what I just showed up in the food place I just showed up in
02:34:37.42 --> 02:34:41.50 food the plan I had some leadership responsibility in in the organization so grab the keys from
02:34:41.50 --> 02:34:46.30 someone take it out of spin yeah run into the ground right a little report and be like bring
02:34:46.30 --> 02:34:50.78 a back and get the keys back to the maintenance guys and yeah hey this thing is broken give me another one
02:34:50.78 --> 02:34:58.78 it was it was awesome yeah so I did that totally great for for my marriage my I was able to
02:34:58.78 --> 02:35:03.26 combine all these professional interests with great which you don't get to do in the Marine Corps
02:35:03.26 --> 02:35:08.94 when there's a war going on you just don't get to do that and here I am and do I had no more friends
02:35:08.94 --> 02:35:13.50 in the Marine Corps man nobody liked me they're all doing back to back to back to Poem
02:35:13.50 --> 02:35:18.86 it's an airplanes are breaking and I'm living in Vegas flying the raptor all my bros were like
02:35:18.86 --> 02:35:23.74 we're done with you man we got nothing for you so you know I was just I was felt guilty I
02:35:23.74 --> 02:35:29.42 did not feel guilty but I almost did yeah almost did and then I go out we moved to
02:35:29.42 --> 02:35:33.58 Destin Florida you know or or Fort Altman Beach and we lived in Niceville and this awesome house
02:35:33.58 --> 02:35:38.78 in this great community and I was the first pilot to ever fly the 35th be operationally in the
02:35:38.78 --> 02:35:45.82 world ridiculous did that probably two and a half years and it was awesome and then you what brought
02:35:45.82 --> 02:35:52.70 you up to DC so what brought me up to DC so I was I was so sure that I was going to leave the
02:35:52.70 --> 02:35:56.94 Marine Corps after that command tour they have 35 that I reapplyed a Dartmouth got back in again
02:35:57.50 --> 02:36:03.34 got accepted to do you have to give another deposit no I was I was smart enough not to pay the deposit
02:36:03.34 --> 02:36:06.94 because there's a tiny little possibility that was going to work out anyway I did get into Dartmouth
02:36:06.94 --> 02:36:13.98 again and it's like babe I'm going to go to get my MBA I was wanted to get my MBA and I got selected
02:36:13.98 --> 02:36:19.98 for an academic fellowship where I basically got to go to grad school for a year I went to
02:36:19.98 --> 02:36:25.66 say the semi-dejons Hopkins University to give my masters and I basically went to DC it was a
02:36:25.66 --> 02:36:31.50 civilian for a year and between those two things is another terrible deal like the Marine
02:36:31.50 --> 02:36:36.14 Corps like to pay you to go be a full-time student at Johns Hopkins which which they did
02:36:37.34 --> 02:36:42.22 so we moved up to DC and I went to Johns Hopkins to get my masters and then the next thing
02:36:42.22 --> 02:36:49.58 they offered you is to go back and yeah so from there the the payback of that good deal was
02:36:49.58 --> 02:36:54.22 to go to the Pentagon which was totally reasonable thing I'd post command I'd been to school
02:36:54.22 --> 02:36:58.78 I mean it certainly couldn't complain about how tough my life was in the Marine Corps since
02:36:58.78 --> 02:37:03.66 you know the last eight years or whatever it was and I just went basically did a desk job in the
02:37:03.66 --> 02:37:08.46 Pentagon and I worked for and the joint staff and the chairman joined Chiefs of Staff just working
02:37:08.46 --> 02:37:11.90 some project it wasn't all that exciting it was I learned a bunch but it was just kind of a
02:37:12.62 --> 02:37:17.98 kind of a med job I was you know very nine to five strict hours don't take work on we know black
02:37:17.98 --> 02:37:26.30 Barry no real responsibility pretty chill life life was pretty good I selected I picked up Colonel while I was there
02:37:27.66 --> 02:37:34.62 the end of 2015 I was selected for Colonel and in the summer of 2016 I selected for a command
02:37:34.62 --> 02:37:44.06 again as a Colonel this time to command and have 35 squadron but I didn't want to do that
02:37:44.94 --> 02:37:48.30 I don't know how this is going to come across so the people listening and what a terrible deal
02:37:48.30 --> 02:37:52.94 was the Marine Corps asked if it would be a Colonel and go fly up 35 again and I'm not I'm not
02:37:53.58 --> 02:37:59.26 I don't want this to come across that I was complaining but what I the one thing that I
02:37:59.26 --> 02:38:04.70 in all those great deals and dude they were great deals the thing that I was missing the most
02:38:05.58 --> 02:38:10.54 was that I always kind of felt like I had one foot in a one foot out they were these non-deploying jobs the Air Force
02:38:10.54 --> 02:38:19.26 exchange the the F 35 job was kind of standing up a squadron we weren't prepping for anything and I
02:38:19.26 --> 02:38:29.10 loved it but I could feel sort of underneath the surface I got a lack of investment I could tell I
02:38:29.10 --> 02:38:34.78 just wasn't I didn't have to be 100 set pot committed because there was no we're going to go to
02:38:34.78 --> 02:38:39.02 deploy or we're going to go to there was no thing that was going to happen and I think one of the
02:38:39.02 --> 02:38:42.94 healthiest things about being in the Marine Corps is always prepping for something so even the
02:38:42.94 --> 02:38:46.78 crappy stuff you don't want to do you know hey we got to do this because the end state is this
02:38:47.74 --> 02:38:52.62 and I was missing that and it sort of over time started to erode a little bit that I did I was
02:38:52.62 --> 02:38:59.98 catching myself on a little slack in the line to be honest with you I to be really blunt I didn't
02:38:59.98 --> 02:39:03.82 have to bring my a game every day I just didn't I could do the things that I was doing certainly
02:39:03.82 --> 02:39:08.70 in airplane because there was just an element that there was no outcome to what I was preparing for
02:39:09.42 --> 02:39:14.94 and I started to kind of find other interests like school became really interesting to me I did that
02:39:14.94 --> 02:39:19.74 year and so I continued my education jobs options and started working towards my MBA because I needed
02:39:19.74 --> 02:39:26.14 something or wanted something else and once you kind of catch in your mind that the Marine Corps
02:39:26.14 --> 02:39:29.50 and what they're asking you to do I was going to go back to a training squadron I wanted to go to
02:39:29.50 --> 02:39:33.34 be an operational commander with operational units that are preparing to go something I wasn't
02:39:33.34 --> 02:39:37.58 going to get to do that I was going to go back to a training environment I caught myself
02:39:39.74 --> 02:39:44.78 losing the thing that was the most passionate about the Marine Corps and seeing it's more of like
02:39:44.78 --> 02:39:48.14 okay three years here this will get me to this retirement and this amount of money and it was just
02:39:48.14 --> 02:39:54.22 starting to become a little too professional and not enough a passion and I don't mean to say I was
02:39:54.22 --> 02:39:59.02 going to need to feel like a 21 year old again I you don't need to recreate it like that but my
02:39:59.02 --> 02:40:03.90 life actually sat me down with her talking and she just kind of looked at me as like dude you're
02:40:03.90 --> 02:40:08.06 not going to be happy doing this it was really clear to her I think even more clear than it was
02:40:08.06 --> 02:40:17.42 for me it's hard to come across as ungrateful but I I could I was not going to be good at that job
02:40:17.42 --> 02:40:21.26 because there was something that was missing it was something that I didn't there was nothing
02:40:21.26 --> 02:40:28.30 that I about it that it made me feel passionate about doing it so no joke man last year August I
02:40:29.74 --> 02:40:33.74 basically told that I declined command I declined promotion and I put it for her time and all the same
02:40:33.74 --> 02:40:41.82 day and that was a big move man the big move that created a little splash out there in the world
02:40:41.82 --> 02:40:49.82 yeah maybe it was it didn't it surprised everybody but my wife obviously she was totally
02:40:49.82 --> 02:40:52.70 got it and I knew it was the right thing in my closest buddy so I mean I talked to my
02:40:52.70 --> 02:40:57.98 bros my tight my bros those guys understood but yeah it was a big move and I was turning
02:40:57.98 --> 02:41:03.50 down what by a whole right by all rights was a really good great deal another great deal down
02:41:03.50 --> 02:41:12.54 about it and then at some point you show up at a different kind of event in Virginia with
02:41:12.54 --> 02:41:19.66 Lafen Eye working with a company for our company Ashland front we're doing a leadership training
02:41:19.66 --> 02:41:25.26 for a company and you decided to come down and check it out Lafen said come on down check this out
02:41:25.26 --> 02:41:31.58 see what you think of this yeah so Lafen talked to me a couple years ago when I was leaving
02:41:31.58 --> 02:41:36.86 that F-35 job before I went up to DC and he's like hey man joc on our doing this thing it's going to be
02:41:36.86 --> 02:41:42.86 awesome um we'd love to you know talk about it and I'm like hey man I'm I'm I'm all in this other
02:41:42.86 --> 02:41:48.14 gig I'm going to school I'm going to the Marine Corps we in state and touch I mean Lafen's
02:41:48.14 --> 02:41:51.82 buddy I mean is a guy that that I appreciate it you know the times that we reconnected here and
02:41:51.82 --> 02:41:55.90 there and I certainly appreciate it the call but it just really wasn't in the calculator and I wasn't
02:41:55.90 --> 02:42:02.38 really I wasn't there so I when I told him like hey man I dropped my letter I'm getting out
02:42:04.38 --> 02:42:08.14 and like I said Lafen isn't always the easiest guy to get a hold of right away to talk sometimes
02:42:08.14 --> 02:42:13.02 he's he's got a lot on his place a busy guy and he texted me back right then I'm on the bus
02:42:13.02 --> 02:42:19.02 leaving the Pentagon is I hid you up time to talk right now so he calls me and we talk for I mean
02:42:19.02 --> 02:42:24.70 probably a solid 45 minutes to an hour and he's like hey joc on our going to be up in Vienna here
02:42:24.70 --> 02:42:31.42 in a couple weeks once you come out for the day I'm like okay right on and he gave me you know
02:42:31.42 --> 02:42:35.66 I like I was following you guys I knew it was going on I was seeing what you're doing things were blowing up
02:42:35.66 --> 02:42:39.42 I was something bragging on my buddy's life in jocot anybody there was listening to me about it
02:42:40.86 --> 02:42:46.46 and I watched you know you and Lafen give this presentation up there in Vienna to this group and
02:42:48.94 --> 02:42:50.46 dude
02:42:50.46 --> 02:42:57.02 you were it was awesome man you were the smile on your face we you know we got done and
02:42:57.02 --> 02:43:04.70 that first day and we sat down with you you were in big time like I am in I want to do this
02:43:04.70 --> 02:43:09.98 this is all you were pumped and yeah and I think that was you know and then and then actually
02:43:09.98 --> 02:43:16.22 we did I brought you up and we did an event with another company yeah and that you're now involved
02:43:16.22 --> 02:43:22.54 with for a long term and and even then you know because then for us you know I wanted to see what
02:43:22.54 --> 02:43:27.34 you were going to do and see how you were going to do it and man I was like I don't know you gave
02:43:27.34 --> 02:43:32.94 your first two paragraphs of talking you know your first two minutes of of explaining something
02:43:32.94 --> 02:43:39.50 I was like okay cool I'm good and I was you know just everything that we talk about all the time
02:43:39.50 --> 02:43:46.06 you know that's in the book and hearing you describe things from the book but with your view on
02:43:46.06 --> 02:43:52.86 it and your angle and it's it's refreshing to me and also I'm just I'm even learning right so
02:43:52.86 --> 02:43:57.02 I'm here in a different angle and like I talk about with with everything it was like we just talked
02:43:57.02 --> 02:44:01.58 about with with flying at top gun or like it isn't your jitter or like it isn't the battlefield
02:44:01.58 --> 02:44:05.10 the more different angles you can see something from the better you're going to get at it and so
02:44:05.10 --> 02:44:10.62 here I am listening to you going oh there's another angle yep here we go so that was awesome and it was
02:44:10.62 --> 02:44:16.30 also the first time you know with J.P. same thing you know I I listened to J. but it's like the
02:44:16.30 --> 02:44:19.90 first time J.P. you came with me and he was just sitting in the back like what you did the first time
02:44:19.90 --> 02:44:24.38 he was sitting in the back and and I say man come come on you know when when I do this Q&A answer some
02:44:24.38 --> 02:44:29.66 questions and you know I'm thinking hey if something goes sideways I'll just be able to cover for
02:44:29.66 --> 02:44:34.06 him no big deal you know somebody asked a question and J.P. kind of gives me a look like hey
02:44:34.06 --> 02:44:38.62 well I'll answer this and I was like okay you know go ahead I'll just cover for you just
02:44:38.62 --> 02:44:43.18 just give us an awesome answer I'm like okay I'll sit down now and it's the same thing with you I was
02:44:43.18 --> 02:44:47.02 like you know you're thinking okay where's he gonna go with this with this is a tough question or
02:44:47.02 --> 02:44:53.02 whatever and boom here you go you know fire for a fact and both those two events happened really close
02:44:53.02 --> 02:45:00.22 together for me and for for me it was and I call actually called life I think it was the next day
02:45:00.22 --> 02:45:06.70 or is I might have been that evening and I said hey life you know we're good to go like we are not
02:45:06.70 --> 02:45:13.90 gonna have to do all of this ourselves because Dave and J.P. can do this they get it they can they
02:45:13.90 --> 02:45:19.02 can do it and which was you know everybody in their own I don't want to think it's arrogance
02:45:19.02 --> 02:45:25.02 but it's it's just you don't see it and so you kind of think how is any you know it's like when
02:45:25.02 --> 02:45:27.90 you're in command of something that's one of the really hard things to do is let go you know and
02:45:27.90 --> 02:45:32.54 and life's talked about this all the time you know when I'd be watching him roll out on out the gate
02:45:32.54 --> 02:45:37.26 for his first mission I done all kinds of missions like that and here he's going out of his first one
02:45:37.26 --> 02:45:41.10 that he's in charge of and you're thinking man I should just go I want to go and I want to go and
02:45:41.10 --> 02:45:45.58 and then you know two hours it comes back and you're like high five you and then you go cool I
02:45:45.58 --> 02:45:50.30 don't have to be the guy that goes every time and so when when I saw you when I saw J.P. you know it's like
02:45:50.30 --> 02:45:56.86 this is awesome and I called life and said we are gonna be good to go other guys they can do this
02:45:56.86 --> 02:46:00.86 they can bring the same message they can bring the same passion and power and knowledge and that was
02:46:00.86 --> 02:46:08.14 very very you know refreshing to me and bottom line is the experiences are the same I mean they're
02:46:08.14 --> 02:46:13.82 not exactly the same but the the experience and the body is the same and then the experience that we
02:46:13.82 --> 02:46:18.46 had throughout our military career and now you get to see what it's like interacting with businesses
02:46:18.46 --> 02:46:23.98 and you see all those similarities so that was a that was a big day and so in case I haven't made this
02:46:23.98 --> 02:46:32.54 clear yet Dave now is with us part of the echelon front team and doing what we do helping businesses
02:46:32.54 --> 02:46:37.82 with their leadership in their companies so it's awesome it's awesome having you on
02:46:39.10 --> 02:46:43.02 it's huge for me I told you I love you know I love the Marine Corps I'm they're something missing
02:46:43.02 --> 02:46:46.62 and I can't I can't stay in Marine because there's something missing well you leave the Marine Corps
02:46:46.62 --> 02:46:53.18 like how in the hell am I gonna recreate that thing that I'm looking for not in the military it's
02:46:53.18 --> 02:46:59.90 all I know is that's the place and that was my biggest my biggest fear was I'm not gonna go like
02:46:59.90 --> 02:47:07.66 go to work you know go do something that I so I was worried like I got to find something and
02:47:07.66 --> 02:47:11.58 that's part of the reason why that first gig with you guys in the back was like holy cow man
02:47:11.58 --> 02:47:17.02 you you've got to be kidding me it's all those things you just discussed all those things I spent
02:47:17.02 --> 02:47:23.58 on a whole life living and breathing and learning and and and then it's with people like
02:47:23.58 --> 02:47:29.10 late in jocco from where my work we're gonna do this together yeah so good deal Dave
02:47:30.38 --> 02:47:37.18 you kidding me yeah dude I wasn't on monster dot com searching for employment opportunities
02:47:37.18 --> 02:47:42.38 late call me he's at come to Vienna my dad okay my head was a million miles away man
02:47:42.38 --> 02:47:46.54 I'm just working through paperwork to drop my letter out to leave the Marine Corps like very
02:47:46.54 --> 02:47:52.54 hastily with no no plan B there was no I'm leaving to do this you can ask when you like there was
02:47:52.54 --> 02:47:59.50 zero conversation about what I'm gonna do and I came back from them like obviously here's the plan
02:48:00.78 --> 02:48:07.10 and dude he was instantaneous for me it was instantaneous and then to be able to share that
02:48:07.10 --> 02:48:12.62 message and believe it and have all those feelings and in a totally different way and to work with you
02:48:12.62 --> 02:48:19.66 guys yeah and it's cool too because you get that kind of for you top gun for me working in the training
02:48:19.66 --> 02:48:25.26 command where it's like like what I already talked about you you have this experience and when I
02:48:25.26 --> 02:48:28.30 was getting out I'm saying what am I gonna do with this thing what am I gonna do that I got all this
02:48:28.30 --> 02:48:32.54 knowledge and I thought okay well I guess I'll put it in a cruise box over here lock it up and it'll
02:48:32.54 --> 02:48:39.10 you know it'll fade away and turn in dust but when you realize that you can take what you learned
02:48:39.10 --> 02:48:45.58 and you can apply it to all these you know civilian civilians and civilian companies it's it's
02:48:45.58 --> 02:48:51.90 pretty it's a pretty damn good feeling to have and to be able to go go out and do it on a regular basis
02:48:51.90 --> 02:48:58.14 and one of the best things about it is you get to see the improvement you get to see teams and again
02:49:00.22 --> 02:49:04.14 it's kind of like when you show up and you see the leadership issues you're having it's like
02:49:04.14 --> 02:49:09.50 you're seeing you know what the future is you know how to fix it and you just go this is going to be fun
02:49:09.50 --> 02:49:14.06 and you get to see these people grow and learn and improve and get better and if they're already good
02:49:14.06 --> 02:49:17.34 you get to see them become awesome if they're not doing great you get to see them improve their
02:49:17.34 --> 02:49:22.38 position and then moving that direction so it's definitely rewarding from that aspect I know you've
02:49:22.38 --> 02:49:26.70 already seen that yeah without it out and you know that book and the lessons and you talked to
02:49:26.70 --> 02:49:32.46 you know the title of the book is how US Navy SEALS LEADN WIN you know I'm top my life is what I learned
02:49:32.46 --> 02:49:39.18 from from top gun in the Marine Corps it just so happens like we said it's exactly the same I have my
02:49:39.18 --> 02:49:44.78 own long list of my personal experiences with those things but I was telling you the day like the
02:49:44.78 --> 02:49:50.94 concepts it's identical and so there's no like big leap in my mind how am I going to get there from
02:49:50.94 --> 02:49:55.26 how am I going to embrace this it's oh yeah oh my god that's exactly what I've been doing for the
02:49:55.26 --> 02:50:00.86 last 23 years only my stories this this and this and this is my view of that so again man it was just
02:50:00.86 --> 02:50:07.42 it was so easy to just see it and go this is this is legit I am I'm I want to I want to I want
02:50:07.42 --> 02:50:12.46 in right now like a slow down like no 100% I don't want I don't want to go look for like this is still

02:52:47.50 --> 02:52:53.98 not happening we won't be hiding it's going to be all of us together will be learning be
02:52:53.98 --> 02:53:01.82 becoming better leaders we will see you there now as far as this podcast goes echo Charles
02:53:02.78 --> 02:53:08.06 maybe you could present us at this time with some information on sure if anybody does want to
02:53:08.06 --> 02:53:12.70 support this podcast how they could do it yeah small presentation yeah small presentation who is
02:53:12.70 --> 02:53:16.70 that with the green M&M's that thing he said with the green that was somebody right
02:53:16.70 --> 02:53:20.06 somebody be rough it's David Lee Roth and I actually know the story behind this
02:53:21.18 --> 02:53:26.78 there's a reason why he did that they would have a it's called a I forget what it's called
02:53:26.78 --> 02:53:31.34 but when you go to somewhere oh it's called a writer right so you get a contract and the
02:53:31.34 --> 02:53:36.06 contract comes with a writer and says this is the things that we need so what David Lee Roth from
02:53:36.06 --> 02:53:44.86 Van Hayle would do is he would say hey I want you know seven bowls of M&M's with no brown M&M's
02:53:44.86 --> 02:53:51.02 in them or green or whatever I think it was brown but he said no brown M&M's and this sounds
02:53:51.02 --> 02:53:55.58 like a ridiculous request right I mean who would possibly want that blah blah blah blah well
02:53:55.58 --> 02:54:00.54 David Lee Roth did it for reason why do you think he did it can you guess no can you guess
02:54:01.26 --> 02:54:05.18 because check it out think of how simple this is he's doing a concert one night he's doing a
02:54:05.18 --> 02:54:09.26 concert two light later to concert three nights after that so he's on the road hitting these
02:54:09.26 --> 02:54:12.22 concert venues and there's all this stuff that has to be set up and all the stuff that
02:54:12.22 --> 02:54:17.66 lights and sound and sound boards and special effects and ramps and all this stuff's got to be
02:54:17.66 --> 02:54:25.02 set up and it's got to be set up right when he would show up if the seven bowls of M&M's were
02:54:25.02 --> 02:54:29.34 laid out and there's no brown M&M's in him he wouldn't have to go and inspect everything because
02:54:29.34 --> 02:54:36.06 he knew that they were paying attention and if he got there and it wasn't that way he knew
02:54:36.06 --> 02:54:40.78 that these people had an issue with attention detail and so now he had to be go and scrutinize
02:54:40.78 --> 02:54:44.54 and make sure everything wasn't placed the way it was supposed to be. Little lesson learned from
02:54:44.54 --> 02:54:47.50 Bayvenley Roth. This was like a little test. Yeah really. Yeah really.
02:54:47.50 --> 02:54:54.46 Yeah really. A little test M&M's test. Interesting. And by the way that story that I just told
02:54:54.46 --> 02:55:02.46 that may be a hundred percent urban myth but I I know I heard it somebody. I thought I think it's true.
02:55:02.46 --> 02:55:07.02 I'm sure somebody I'm sure our listeners will tell us where that can be referenced. Yeah for some
02:55:07.02 --> 02:55:11.42 reason I thought I thought I thought of somebody else and that's just how they were. Where they're OCD or
02:55:11.42 --> 02:55:20.94 something. I don't know either way. Hey you're so you think about like the reason you were such
02:55:20.94 --> 02:55:28.30 an important asset given your skill set as a forward air control. That's what's called is
02:55:28.30 --> 02:55:33.42 because essentially you have all this expertise while you're in the air and you can bring all that
02:55:33.42 --> 02:55:39.50 brain in eyes to the ground. Yeah that's why you're better than your, yeah. I mean in a
02:55:39.50 --> 02:55:44.70 yes. Absolutely. I didn't really pick up on that till kind of later. I was like dang that's pretty
02:55:44.70 --> 02:55:51.90 advanced. If you think about any aspect I mean it's like if you that's why in the corner of a
02:55:51.90 --> 02:55:58.14 mixed martial arts match oftentimes they'll be a striking coach. They'll be a due to due to coach
02:55:58.14 --> 02:56:02.22 and they'll be a wrestling coach. You know they'll have those specific guys in there and sometimes they'll
02:56:02.22 --> 02:56:08.86 bring a specific guy in to corner like like Dean. Dean has been brought in to corner guys
02:56:08.86 --> 02:56:12.54 that are going against a specific due to two person because they want to get a little
02:56:12.54 --> 02:56:20.86 of that expertise. Same fundamental concept here. Hey when we start with this podcast I need
02:56:20.86 --> 02:56:29.02 it somebody that knew how to press record. Boom. See same thing identical. Yeah. I did it all those
02:56:29.02 --> 02:56:35.26 years of pressing record and then stop and then record again. Yeah. So I'm kind of like good deal echo
02:56:35.26 --> 02:56:40.38 in a way. Yeah. Same thing. Doing the same thing is Dave really. When it comes down to it
02:56:40.38 --> 02:56:51.10 speaking of doing good things. So that was a big like breath like you better say something.
02:56:51.10 --> 02:56:56.54 I'm gonna say a lot. Actually I'm not gonna say a lot actually. Yeah. You know last one I felt like
02:56:56.54 --> 02:57:02.62 I really went deep into the krill oil analogy the night club Omega 3's. Oh tell me that. Yeah.
02:57:02.62 --> 02:57:09.18 You know love of God. I feel like the mess. That was a good analogy. That was a perfect analogy.
02:57:09.18 --> 02:57:14.22 That was excellent. In fact it was so good I wouldn't touch it. That's what I'm saying. You know that
02:57:14.22 --> 02:57:18.38 you can do this too much of a good thing. Anyway if you get a no acrylic oil is it's a little like
02:57:18.38 --> 02:57:25.02 what shrimp things. Baby shrimp. You extract the oil and it's getting good for your joints. The
02:57:25.02 --> 02:57:29.34 Omega 3's and that. The good for your joints. Anyway, in regards to supplementation which
02:57:30.14 --> 02:57:36.70 I'm down for now by the way. I'm a supplement person. Not all supplements. Just the key ones.
02:57:36.70 --> 02:57:43.02 Doing maintenance whatnot. Anyway, getting from on it that's the best ones. Everyone knows that factually.
02:57:43.02 --> 02:57:49.50 So if you want a 10% discount on that go to on it.com slash.com.
02:57:50.54 --> 02:57:56.06 I want to talk about the sodium in the water situation. I got to feel that we're just gonna hear it over here.
02:57:56.06 --> 02:58:03.34 Yeah. So. So while they even I are talking through the podcast are you just over here just
02:58:03.34 --> 02:58:09.10 dreaming up just somewhere you're going with that. When you say echo how can you support? I'm thinking
02:58:10.30 --> 02:58:15.82 dang you days been controlling all this stuff and going to talk to you been doing your stuff and
02:58:15.82 --> 02:58:20.62 I'm watching like sodium in the lake videos. You ever watch those? You're doing what you have to.
02:58:20.62 --> 02:58:22.14 Doing what I'm doing. Yeah. So.
02:58:26.86 --> 02:58:31.82 Anyway, the more I watch those the better analogy I realize it is. You know with the Amazon

02:58:53.82 --> 02:58:59.42 URL into their bookmarks. Some people are smart like that. Yeah. Like you just says Amazon.
02:58:59.42 --> 02:59:05.42 So on the right on my bookmarks, Martin just says Amazon and that's what I did. Right. Not even smart.
02:59:05.42 --> 02:59:11.74 I did that. Yeah. Amen. That's a smart thing to do. Good way to support. Yeah. Good way to support.

03:00:42.30 --> 03:00:50.94 Dang. This was kind of like a bullshit crowd get after it. Yeah. Yeah. This is like a crowd.
03:00:51.90 --> 03:00:58.54 I wouldn't consider it crowdsourced idea, but, you know, how crowd demanded. Yeah, you know, I was like,
03:00:58.54 --> 03:01:02.78 hey, that you put this on the shirt, put this on the shirt, make sense, make sense. So we're kind of extrapolated
03:01:02.78 --> 03:01:09.10 all the ideas that I thought were good. Master more of the ideas that I heard from you. You thought were good.
03:01:09.10 --> 03:01:16.78 And boom, there it is. New design. Currently legit. Yeah. Jocquoise store.com. Anyway,
03:01:17.82 --> 03:01:26.86 some cool stuff. Good for, uh, there's stuff for women and rash cards. There's stuff for rash
03:01:26.86 --> 03:01:32.14 cards. No. Hey, that was the interruption of thought. But so like rash cards. We have to
03:01:32.14 --> 03:01:37.10 do some more for Brady after this one. Yeah, no, it's okay. Good. You know how you think of like
03:01:37.10 --> 03:01:41.26 five things at once and they're all like jocking to see which ones are going to come to the next.
03:01:41.26 --> 03:01:46.86 Yeah, that's what happened right there. The rash, the rash card thought came in in one.
03:01:46.86 --> 03:01:52.22 Anyway, I think I'm going to put a new rash card one design out as well. But anyway,
03:01:52.22 --> 03:01:59.82 rash cards, if you want 19% improvement in performance. All aspects of performance. All. Yeah.
03:01:59.82 --> 03:02:06.62 That's mental physical emotional as well. Double blind tested, by the way. Yeah. I think like
03:02:06.62 --> 03:02:12.30 quadruple blind. Yeah. And not blind tested. All that stuff. Psychological warfare. If you're
03:02:12.30 --> 03:02:19.90 having weakness in maintaining unmitigated daily discipline in all things,
03:02:22.70 --> 03:02:28.30 listen to psychological warfare. Yeah. I got, I just got interviewed the other day and it was a,
03:02:28.30 --> 03:02:33.18 the guy, you know, he sent me a blue question, you know, hey, what do you do when you're in a
03:02:33.18 --> 03:02:38.70 situation where you've got, you know, you want to go to the gym or you're, you're supposed to do
03:02:38.70 --> 03:02:43.26 some hard task for workers to some, trying to do something to improve yourself and you, you know,
03:02:43.26 --> 03:02:48.14 the, the mindset comes in where you just, you just don't want to do it. You know, what should
03:02:48.14 --> 03:02:56.38 you think people should do then? Yeah. And I said, do it anyway. Right. And then it was all quiet.
03:02:56.38 --> 03:03:00.78 Because he thinks I'm going to give this big explanation. But there's no big explanation. Yeah.
03:03:00.78 --> 03:03:06.46 The explanation is, oh, the stuff is hard. Yeah. I can't make that thing easier for you. I cannot
03:03:06.46 --> 03:03:12.46 make 20 reps squats any easier for you. I can't do it. They're going to be hard. In fact,
03:03:12.46 --> 03:03:16.30 they're going to suck. And I can't make nothing. I can do is going to make it easier for you.
03:03:16.30 --> 03:03:23.58 You know what you have to do to do it anyways. It's kind of like, I told this to Jade that exact
03:03:23.58 --> 03:03:29.42 situation or that thing that you just said where it's, even if you don't feel like doing it,
03:03:29.42 --> 03:03:33.50 you still want to do it and all this stuff. But your body is like, oh, it's kind of running on
03:03:33.50 --> 03:03:39.50 auto. Like, okay, compare it to like a video camera, right? Where you put the settings on auto and it'll
03:03:39.50 --> 03:03:43.82 it'll adjust with how it's feeling. And that's how it's going to handle any situation. The
03:03:43.82 --> 03:03:49.26 light kind of goes down. It kind of adjusts how it feels, you know, that to deal with this situation.
03:03:49.26 --> 03:03:54.70 So if you're running on auto and you don't feel like dealing head on with this workout, these squats
03:03:54.70 --> 03:03:58.54 you're going to maneuver around it. Just kind of automatically, no, you got to turn it to manual
03:03:58.54 --> 03:04:02.30 manual. You'll be like, I don't care if they're hard squats, easy squats, how what I feel.
03:04:02.30 --> 03:04:06.54 I'm going to do them. This is what we're doing. Yes, exactly. So it's like a manual control.
03:04:06.54 --> 03:04:09.90 Yeah. Just control your own mind. Yes. You've talked about that before. Don't do it on like the
03:04:09.90 --> 03:04:15.82 automate because your body wants to rest. Really? It wants to rest week. Your body wants to rest
03:04:15.82 --> 03:04:21.42 every single day actually. You got to turn it from auto to manual. And you can get information like this
03:04:21.42 --> 03:04:29.34 in psychological warfare on iTunes. The artist's name is Jockel Willing. The artist,
03:04:29.34 --> 03:04:34.14 I never thought that I would be. I thought you had to paint something or sculpt something to be an artist.
03:04:35.18 --> 03:04:39.58 Yeah, I thought that. I think it's. But now I put something on iTunes, then they just know
03:04:39.58 --> 03:04:44.78 you're an artist now. Yeah. Jockel the heart if and I that. Well, I'm going to say they're
03:04:44.78 --> 03:04:48.30 really stretching the words on that. But yeah, man, if you're, you know, if you're
03:04:48.30 --> 03:04:54.78 slipping on the diet, waking up in the morning and you want to hit snooze, maybe postville in the
03:04:54.78 --> 03:05:02.86 workout. And you want how should I say like a spot to switch the dial from automatic to manual?
03:05:03.66 --> 03:05:09.58 That's what it is. So search psychological warfare on iTunes, Jockel Willing. Get after it.
03:05:09.58 --> 03:05:14.38 It's a war on weakness. Yeah, big time. You know, when you're clicking through Amazon,
03:05:14.38 --> 03:05:23.34 by the way, you can get Jockel White Tea there on Amazon. And, you know, when you get it,
03:05:24.86 --> 03:05:31.34 I'm just going to say this, when you get it, you will see. And I'm going to give you one word just
03:05:31.34 --> 03:05:37.98 to kind of what do what you anticipate. Just just think about this deadlift. That's what you're
03:05:37.98 --> 03:05:42.70 going to be. So it's going to come to mind with the Jockel White Tea. It's going to be going up a lot.
03:05:42.70 --> 03:05:49.18 So, and that's by the way, again, quadruple blind double tested that you're going to bring your,
03:05:49.18 --> 03:05:53.90 you know, minimum, what's the lightest? I think the minimum that you're going to get deadlifting
03:05:53.90 --> 03:05:59.90 is 8,000, 8,000 pounds. So get on that. You can also pre-order way the warrior kid. It comes out
03:05:59.90 --> 03:06:09.98 May 2nd. By the way, it just came out on iTunes as one of the most anticipated books of the spring.
03:06:09.98 --> 03:06:16.38 Oh, dang. It got listed. Right. How do you imagine that? Right. Kids book. Now all of a sudden we're
03:06:16.38 --> 03:06:21.34 talking most anticipated book of the spring, which means people are waiting for it and they've ordered
03:06:21.34 --> 03:06:27.82 it. So if you want it, order it now. Now I'm going to tell you, there's some people that are not
03:06:27.82 --> 03:06:31.90 looking forward to this book coming out. They are not anticipating. You know those people are
03:06:31.90 --> 03:06:36.70 bullies. Oh, yeah. Bullies are looking forward to it. I'll tell you who else isn't looking forward to this
03:06:36.70 --> 03:06:44.94 coming out. Donut makers. People that make donuts. You know the gig is up. Weakness. You know
03:06:44.94 --> 03:06:51.02 weakness is like a creature like a creature. Like a creature. Yeah. He's not looking forward to this
03:06:51.02 --> 03:06:55.42 book come out because all those things are going down. All those things are trembling. Make those
03:06:56.70 --> 03:07:04.46 things tremble harder, order, way the warrior kid. For your kid, for your neighbor's kid, and for
03:07:04.46 --> 03:07:12.46 yourself, you will dig it. Also, discipline equals freedom. The field manual is coming out
03:07:12.46 --> 03:07:18.46 October 17th. I know it seems like a long time away, but I'm telling you you should pre-order it now.
03:07:18.46 --> 03:07:23.50 Why? Because when you pre-order it, you will then know that it is coming.
03:07:26.06 --> 03:07:33.02 And when you know it is coming, you will begin to prepare for it mentally and physically for this
03:07:33.02 --> 03:07:39.74 book to arrive on your doorstep. You want to be ready mentally and physically because when you get this
03:07:39.74 --> 03:07:46.30 book, you will have to do certain things. Namely, get after it. Yeah, that one.
03:07:47.18 --> 03:07:51.18 Extreme ownership. Of course, the book, you can get it right now. You know if the weight at all.
03:07:52.70 --> 03:07:59.66 Not just for you, but for your team, your spouse, your boss, your baby, center, your mother-in-law.
03:07:59.66 --> 03:08:04.06 You know she needs a copy of that. She needs it. It takes ownership. So,
03:08:04.06 --> 03:08:08.78 forever, copy, just be gentle with it. You don't have to throw it at her, but maybe just you
03:08:08.78 --> 03:08:16.06 know place it on her desk. So, she can read it because the more people you get in the game and
03:08:16.06 --> 03:08:20.78 start taking ownership of things, the better your life's going to be straight up. Now,

03:08:41.66 --> 03:08:51.50 David Burke. Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocca Willick. Echo Charles, any closing words?
03:08:53.50 --> 03:08:56.38 I feel like we should talk about the movie top gun a little bit.
03:08:56.38 --> 03:09:01.02 Right? No. Actually, one question, one question. You know how like when you watch top gun, right?
03:09:01.02 --> 03:09:06.14 You of course, Maverick, that's your guy or goose, that's your guy. Did you like iceman?
03:09:06.14 --> 03:09:12.46 Yeah, because he was pretty dope. You know what I'm talking about, all right? Absolutely. Who
03:09:12.46 --> 03:09:19.42 doesn't like iceman? Absolutely. There it is. Yeah. Simple as that. That's your wrong question.
03:09:19.42 --> 03:09:25.26 I'll find a question. Or did you ever buzz the tower? You don't see that never happen. Is that fake?
03:09:25.26 --> 03:09:29.26 Is that like you can't really do that? You can't really do that. You can be in a ton of trouble.
03:09:29.26 --> 03:09:33.74 As they said, you can do anything once. You can do that once and then what you're out. You're out.
03:09:33.74 --> 03:09:42.94 But not if you're maverick. Awesome. Dave, man. Obviously thanks to Tom for coming on. You got
03:09:42.94 --> 03:09:46.94 me up. You got me closing remarks and I'm sure we'll do this again and when you listen to this,
03:09:46.94 --> 03:09:50.86 you'll think of a bunch of stuff that we should have said on this one. But anything else you
03:09:50.86 --> 03:09:55.90 want to wrap it up with for today? Yeah, man. First, thanks. This was awesome. I've been thinking
03:09:55.90 --> 03:09:59.10 about this for a couple of weeks. And we've been talking about it. I was super fired up to be here.
03:09:59.10 --> 03:10:05.58 And this was awesome. You know, we were talking about it just briefly. And I mentioned it.
03:10:05.58 --> 03:10:09.42 You know, my life obviously, I talked about the things that they went through.
03:10:11.82 --> 03:10:15.90 So my life and my mom, you know, this is my family and those are folks that endure to whatever
03:10:15.90 --> 03:10:19.34 degree that when you're removed, I think when you're on deployment, you do this stuff. It's hard.
03:10:19.34 --> 03:10:23.10 But it's actually in some ways, harder for the people that you leave behind because they don't
03:10:23.10 --> 03:10:27.02 know what's going on. They're just waiting and wondering and dealing with it and they're kind of
03:10:27.02 --> 03:10:32.94 holding their breath. I remember a story that Whitney told me when I was deployed, I didn't think
03:10:32.94 --> 03:10:38.46 about any of this stuff. A buddy of Niels had come to the house. He was gone. And he couldn't get
03:10:38.46 --> 03:10:43.82 in the house. And he was knocking on the window, which was by the front of the house and kind of
03:10:43.82 --> 03:10:48.46 ringing the doorbell. And it was a late night, like not a time that somebody should be at the door.
03:10:49.02 --> 03:10:52.30 And she didn't want to answer the door. And she's telling me, and this stuff, you don't think
03:10:52.30 --> 03:10:56.46 about that stuff. And you get back in here, the stories because you don't really think about what
03:10:56.46 --> 03:11:00.62 your family's going through because you're busy and you're doing your thing. And she talked about
03:11:01.34 --> 03:11:04.62 the thing that she hated the most was people knocking on the door because she was always just
03:11:04.62 --> 03:11:10.14 sort of a tiny bit paranoid that it was going to be somebody coming to tell her about me.
03:11:12.38 --> 03:11:18.14 You know, Chris's mom Kathy Leon who's someone I don't even have the words to describe how much I
03:11:18.14 --> 03:11:24.54 love her and admire her. And it's not just about her loss. She obviously, she had to answer that call.
03:11:24.54 --> 03:11:30.06 Well, you know, she had to take that call on June 20th, 2006. She took that phone call. But
03:11:30.78 --> 03:11:36.22 that woman has endured the loss of a million who sacrificed herself on behalf of the entire
03:11:36.22 --> 03:11:42.46 country. And my relationship, the irony in all this is that I would not, I would not have a relationship
03:11:42.46 --> 03:11:48.38 with Kathy. And Chris wasn't killed. And I would give anything to take that day back and bring her
03:11:48.38 --> 03:11:55.02 him home. I would trade any of it. But the goodness that comes out of that, there's always, there
03:11:55.02 --> 03:12:01.26 is always some goodness. If you look for hard enough that comes out of all this stuff and the loss
03:12:01.26 --> 03:12:07.50 and the things that you sacrifice. And I know Kathy is certainly listening and I never anticipated
03:12:07.50 --> 03:12:12.54 having a relationship with someone like that based on those circumstances. But my relationship whether
03:12:12.54 --> 03:12:17.90 it is really important. And what she is done for the country is really important. And if you look
03:12:17.90 --> 03:12:22.94 hard enough in the worst situations, you find something that's good. And my relationship with her
03:12:22.94 --> 03:12:27.18 is really good. And I would really, it would be wrong for me to go through this whole podcast and
03:12:27.18 --> 03:12:33.34 talking to all those things without acknowledging that goodness with her. So I wanted to mention that.
03:12:36.06 --> 03:12:44.22 Well, Dave, obviously, thanks for coming on. I know we've been talking about this for a while.
03:12:44.22 --> 03:12:53.98 And it's great to have you on. And thanks for sharing your story with us, the story of you,
03:12:53.98 --> 03:13:12.06 a marine fighter pilot, a forwarder controller, but also a son, a brother, a father, a person.
03:13:12.06 --> 03:13:26.22 And yeah, thanks for sharing the story of Corporal Chris Leon, a marine no doubt.
03:13:26.22 --> 03:13:44.46 A hero without question. But let us remember, let us always remember that these men,
03:13:44.46 --> 03:13:54.86 these men, we call warriors, these men we call soldiers, these men we call marines,
03:13:55.58 --> 03:14:06.46 these men we call heroes. But us never forget that they're people.
03:14:06.46 --> 03:14:21.90 Suns and daughters, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, let us not forget that they're,
03:14:21.90 --> 03:14:29.10 they're not only courageous, vigilant and bold and aggressive and inspiring,
03:14:29.10 --> 03:14:39.66 but they're also funny and outrageous and flawed like any of us,
03:14:43.34 --> 03:14:54.14 then that they're loving and loved, then that they're people,
03:14:54.14 --> 03:15:07.98 people who left behind people, and those that are left behind, never forget,
03:15:07.98 --> 03:15:24.46 like Chris Leon's mom Kathy Leon, who wrote, but note on his memorial page back in 2008.
03:15:24.46 --> 03:15:35.10 And she said, hi baby, another difficult day to face without you here.
03:15:38.46 --> 03:15:44.54 I never thought that memorial day would be in memory of you,
03:15:44.54 --> 03:15:57.18 my dear sweet, beautiful sun. It's been one year, 11 months and five days,
03:15:59.82 --> 03:16:04.70 so close to two years, then I cannot bear the thought.
03:16:04.70 --> 03:16:14.38 We honor you by flying the flag every day and we will place
03:16:15.26 --> 03:16:19.66 your American heroes tribute banner for all to see tomorrow.
03:16:19.66 --> 03:16:34.14 Of course, we will cry more tears and maybe find a smile or laugh as we remember your deep voice,
03:16:34.14 --> 03:16:46.78 great smile, joking sense of humor and the love you showed to us.
03:16:48.46 --> 03:16:53.10 Our hearts are forever empty and broken without you.
03:16:57.74 --> 03:17:00.94 Miss you so much and love you more.
03:17:00.94 --> 03:17:07.98 All our love, moment had.
03:17:07.98 --> 03:17:29.66 Remember, remember, major Henry L. Rodden,
03:17:29.66 --> 03:17:42.86 remember, corporal Christopher Leon, remember those like them who have fallen.
03:17:42.86 --> 03:18:03.26 Remember them as warriors, remember them as heroes, but always, always remember them,
03:18:03.26 --> 03:18:14.78 as people. Remember them.
03:18:14.78 --> 03:18:30.70 Until next time, this is Dave and Echo and Jockel out.
