00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.56
This is Jockel podcast number 189 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, I go good evening and joining us once again is

2
00:00:10.08 --> 00:00:15.28
Dave Burke, good evening Dave good evening and on the last two podcasts

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.24
Dave and I dug into the first four chapters of the Marine Corps

4
00:00:21.20 --> 00:00:26.88
Doctorinal publications MCDP one-tack three tactics. So if you haven't listened to those podcasts

5
00:00:26.88 --> 00:00:35.60
go start there and if you have listened to them then we are diving into chapter five.

6
00:00:36.80 --> 00:00:45.76
You and I were talking over the weekend about how you read these in the basic school

7
00:00:46.40 --> 00:00:53.52
versus how you read them now or how you read it this time around. Yeah. There's a pretty big difference.

8
00:00:53.52 --> 00:01:02.80
Yeah, there's a huge difference. I was saying when you asked about how to read these and I read them we got hand to them in a stack of

9
00:01:02.80 --> 00:01:09.44
Pub so all the Marine Corps manuals probably a foot-high stack of these white books as we'll booklets and at the time it was a chore

10
00:01:10.24 --> 00:01:16.32
It's like something I had to do to pass a test. I didn't look for any real content. I was looking for the answers of the test and that was about it

11
00:01:16.56 --> 00:01:21.20
It wasn't until I went back and looked at them again with a totally different set of eyes and how

12
00:01:21.20 --> 00:01:25.76
Man so many things I could have learned if I actually read it differently the first time

13
00:01:27.04 --> 00:01:34.48
There's I mean I think it has to do when you can overlay your own experience on it is what makes it more

14
00:01:36.32 --> 00:01:38.32
Makes the lessons more obvious but

15
00:01:39.44 --> 00:01:45.84
These books are written so clearly. They're so straightforward. They're so straightforward. Yeah, so clear

16
00:01:45.84 --> 00:01:51.36
And and it's it's amazing that the Marine Corps can pull this off because normally you would think to yourself

17
00:01:51.36 --> 00:01:53.36
Okay, if I told you okay Dave

18
00:01:54.08 --> 00:01:59.84
You me and eight of our friends are gonna write a book by committee. It would be a total nightmare

19
00:02:00.40 --> 00:02:07.28
It would not come out good it would be the most convoluted and confusing thing ever and it would be a total disaster the Marine Corps

20
00:02:07.28 --> 00:02:14.88
Somehow I would love to go and I would love to see how they did this I would love to see how they did this because

21
00:02:15.76 --> 00:02:21.84
What I imagine had to have happened there was one single human that

22
00:02:22.64 --> 00:02:28.80
Had a good grip on the vision and said okay and everyone else this is the most important part

23
00:02:28.80 --> 00:02:32.08
Everyone else kind of respected that vision and respected that person yep

24
00:02:32.08 --> 00:02:38.16
I don't even know who that person was they had to to to pull this off in the Marine Corps. They had to be

25
00:02:39.28 --> 00:02:40.88
someone

26
00:02:40.88 --> 00:02:43.28
For lack of a better word. They had to be someone legit

27
00:02:44.16 --> 00:02:51.04
To be in there and say okay listen you know we're we're leaving out that section and not have everyone up in arms and big debates

28
00:02:51.44 --> 00:02:56.16
Yeah, and you couldn't have a bunch of guys that wanted to put their little spin on it to make it their own thing

29
00:02:56.56 --> 00:02:58.96
They wanted it and you know all eight chapters

30
00:02:58.96 --> 00:03:02.72
I guess there's a tiny little bit of nuance and some of them me a little bit different

31
00:03:03.12 --> 00:03:08.72
But it almost is if the same person I know it's not one guy, but it's that's the same thing all the way through the same theme

32
00:03:09.12 --> 00:03:13.76
And there's not one chapter in there that is oh, this is too complex. So this doesn't really get to the point

33
00:03:13.76 --> 00:03:18.96
They're all they're all the same and what you described I've been in some of those meetings not not to write a publication

34
00:03:19.28 --> 00:03:24.56
Everything's done by committee you get five guys in a room and you do this and somebody deferred to somebody else

35
00:03:24.56 --> 00:03:31.84
But there's a vision on this from the first word to the last word that is throughout and it requires actually people recognizing

36
00:03:32.24 --> 00:03:36.16
Hey, that guy's ideas that that's what we're doing and everybody gets it gets around and buying that

37
00:03:36.32 --> 00:03:39.92
Yeah, so not only not only is it amazing the amount of

38
00:03:40.96 --> 00:03:46.56
Intelligence and knowledge that was in the room but the amount of humility for someone to listen to someone else say hey

39
00:03:47.12 --> 00:03:52.96
I just wrote this part. I just wrote these three sentences and for someone to else to sit in the back

40
00:03:52.96 --> 00:03:58.56
Then we go you know what those are good leave them how they are there's a massive amount of

41
00:03:59.36 --> 00:04:02.56
Humility in in writing this thing and putting this thing together

42
00:04:03.20 --> 00:04:07.52
So let's go back to the book chapter five chapter five is called

43
00:04:09.04 --> 00:04:11.04
adapting

44
00:04:11.04 --> 00:04:22.32
It starts off with a couple quotes victory smiles upon those who anticipate the changes in the character of war not upon those who wait

45
00:04:22.72 --> 00:04:25.92
to adapt themselves after they occur

46
00:04:30.16 --> 00:04:32.16
Hmm

47
00:04:32.64 --> 00:04:34.16
That's

48
00:04:34.16 --> 00:04:42.96
Guleo do it which I'm sure I'm saying wrong some an Italian an Italian general who is a

49
00:04:43.92 --> 00:04:48.000
Air power theorist you probably learned about him in

50
00:04:49.20 --> 00:04:56.32
Some somewhere along your course of life. Yeah for sure because he was early on he was thought we're talking by plane

51
00:04:56.32 --> 00:04:58.32
Yeah power that's what he was talking about

52
00:04:59.20 --> 00:05:03.12
Air power could break the will of the enemy is kind of one of his one of his theories

53
00:05:03.12 --> 00:05:09.44
Which is true to a point to a point to a point. It's true. All right next quote

54
00:05:10.56 --> 00:05:17.12
In any problem where an opposing force exists and cannot be regulated one must foresee and provide for alternative courses

55
00:05:17.92 --> 00:05:21.36
Adaptability is the law which govern survival in wars

56
00:05:22.72 --> 00:05:24.72
As in life

57
00:05:24.72 --> 00:05:29.92
War being but a concentrated form of the human struggle against the environment hmm

58
00:05:29.92 --> 00:05:32.48
BH little heart so

59
00:05:33.28 --> 00:05:36.32
What what what what what's one of my quote? I have a quote

60
00:05:38.80 --> 00:05:41.60
Right I'm quoting myself, but I've said this for a long time

61
00:05:42.40 --> 00:05:49.20
I think the quote is combat reflects life only amplified and intensified so BH

62
00:05:49.52 --> 00:05:50.88
little heart who's

63
00:05:50.88 --> 00:05:53.20
British soldier world war one military historian

64
00:05:53.20 --> 00:06:02.64
Very very prolific military theorist he said it even better than me of course wars a concentrated form of the human struggle

65
00:06:03.68 --> 00:06:05.68
Against the environment

66
00:06:05.68 --> 00:06:08.48
So you have to be able to adapt that's the name of this chapter

67
00:06:09.76 --> 00:06:17.04
And here we go it kicks off the modern battlefield battlefield is characterized by friction uncertainty disorder and rapid change

68
00:06:17.04 --> 00:06:24.80
I like working in environment that's characterized by friction uncertainty disorder and rapid change

69
00:06:24.80 --> 00:06:27.52
Those are like the things that horrify all human beings

70
00:06:28.96 --> 00:06:34.48
Uncertainty everyone hates that disorder at most people hate that and rapid change everyone hates that

71
00:06:35.12 --> 00:06:41.76
And that's what as a military human that's what you've got to be that's what you got to be ready for and that's what you got to train for and that's what you got to be

72
00:06:41.76 --> 00:06:50.32
For lack of order you've got to learn to love that stuff. Yeah, I mean what in life that you do that matters isn't characterized by those words something that's actually important yeah

73
00:06:50.96 --> 00:06:56.64
Each situation is a unique combination of shifting factors that cannot be controlled with precision or certainty

74
00:06:57.76 --> 00:07:04.72
This chapter discusses ways to think about adapting or modifying our decisions based on changed circumstances or sudden opportunities

75
00:07:04.72 --> 00:07:09.84
Attractically proficient leader must be able to adapt actions to each situation the

76
00:07:11.96 --> 00:07:17.20
Utilup discussed in chapter four essentially describes the process of adaptation

77
00:07:17.20 --> 00:07:24.64
We observe the situation oriented to it decide what to do and act the antagonist who can consistently adapt more quickly to the situation

78
00:07:24.64 --> 00:07:30.60
We'll have a significant advantage adaptability is thus an important part of marine cortex

79
00:07:30.60 --> 00:07:37.40
There's something you don't think of every day that adaptability is literally part of marine cortex

80
00:07:38.12 --> 00:07:43.72
In essence adaptability means shortening the time it takes to adjust to each new situation

81
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.76
We see this with businesses all the time

82
00:07:47.56 --> 00:07:49.40
businesses that either

83
00:07:49.40 --> 00:07:53.08
Adapt and win or don't adapt and lose

84
00:07:53.08 --> 00:08:01.32
Yeah, we see businesses that they'll lay out a plan that how this big strategy this how I see things going and the ones that stick to that and refuse to

85
00:08:01.32 --> 00:08:06.52
Adjust and recognize that that their environment is changing they force themselves around that initial plan and don't adjust

86
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.64
They fail and a

87
00:08:09.64 --> 00:08:16.04
The connection from combat to business we make that connection all the time and it's the exact same thing is your plan is gonna change your world is gonna change quickly

88
00:08:16.04 --> 00:08:20.36
And you better adapt and if you can you'll be safe you'll be fine. You'll be successful and if you can't

89
00:08:20.36 --> 00:08:26.84
Is not gonna work if you don't have humility you want to adapt because you're gonna think that the way you're doing it is fine

90
00:08:26.84 --> 00:08:29.32
Yeah, that's that's the probably the biggest

91
00:08:30.76 --> 00:08:32.20
Thing that

92
00:08:32.20 --> 00:08:38.44
App holds people from adapting is there they're not they're just their ego so big that they're thinking I'm ready to change

93
00:08:39.64 --> 00:08:44.92
People who aren't humble can't change period because they think they got everything figured out that got everything right and they don't change and

94
00:08:45.32 --> 00:08:47.64
That's the recipe for failure. It's all throughout this book

95
00:08:47.64 --> 00:08:50.68
Back to the book there are two basic ways to adapt

96
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.40
Sometimes we have enough situational awareness to understand a situation in advance and take prepared prepared to reaction

97
00:08:57.64 --> 00:09:03.88
This is anticipation at other times we have to adapt the situation on the spur of the moment without time for preparation

98
00:09:04.12 --> 00:09:12.28
This is improvisation to be fully adaptable. We must be able to do both and this is one of those things where I was listening to

99
00:09:12.28 --> 00:09:16.84
As in a Jordan Peterson yesterday and

100
00:09:18.04 --> 00:09:23.16
He was talking about how there's like the creative people and then the other side of the spectrum is

101
00:09:23.88 --> 00:09:30.92
I don't know the conscientious people and and most people are either creative or their conscientious

102
00:09:31.40 --> 00:09:34.84
Conscientious meaning that they'll do what they're told they'll do it to the best of their ability

103
00:09:34.84 --> 00:09:36.84
They're very duty-focused

104
00:09:37.08 --> 00:09:42.20
They're very reliable the creative people obviously are like none of those things and and he

105
00:09:42.20 --> 00:09:43.20
was saying

106
00:09:43.20 --> 00:09:44.20
Creative people are poor

107
00:09:44.76 --> 00:09:49.88
You know this basic thing is if you're creative you're not you're not building a future

108
00:09:49.88 --> 00:09:56.12
You're not doing reliable things on a discipline basis and occasionally you get people that are highly disciplined

109
00:09:56.12 --> 00:09:58.60
Then creative and there be successful

110
00:09:58.60 --> 00:10:03.24
Sometimes you get people that are highly creative and he said there's this tiny percentage of people

111
00:10:03.96 --> 00:10:06.36
that are wildly successful

112
00:10:06.36 --> 00:10:13.64
Creative people write some songwriter some artists some filmmaker that's and oftentimes they're crazy

113
00:10:13.64 --> 00:10:15.96
You see this with fighters too like a wildly

114
00:10:16.68 --> 00:10:18.68
Creative fighter

115
00:10:18.28 --> 00:10:22.76
They're they're if they have that small percentage that they're gonna be successful in fighting

116
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.60
But a lot of times they're the rest of their life is not in good order

117
00:10:27.72 --> 00:10:29.48
Right, it is not in good order

118
00:10:29.48 --> 00:10:34.20
So I've said this that your standard military guy

119
00:10:34.20 --> 00:10:36.20
Girl whoever

120
00:10:37.08 --> 00:10:42.60
If they are on the far end of conscientions they'll be really really good like oh yeah

121
00:10:42.60 --> 00:10:47.64
They're gonna get promoted. They're gonna do is they're told they're gonna follow the orders and they're be good

122
00:10:47.64 --> 00:10:53.40
I'm not saying that in a negative way at all like they're squared away and it's awesome and they're great to work for

123
00:10:53.40 --> 00:10:55.40
They want to do a good job

124
00:10:55.40 --> 00:10:58.68
But they get like tapped out at a certain point

125
00:10:58.68 --> 00:11:06.60
Because they don't have that spark of creativity that they can look at a rapidly changing situation and go

126
00:11:06.60 --> 00:11:08.60
I know what we're gonna do

127
00:11:08.60 --> 00:11:09.64
So

128
00:11:09.64 --> 00:11:17.48
Occasionally and and and a lot of times those people that are creative are too creative for the military and they end up leaving because they can't stand the constraints that are put on them

129
00:11:17.48 --> 00:11:18.28
So

130
00:11:18.28 --> 00:11:23.96
You know even when you read about people like patent people that were wildly successful

131
00:11:23.96 --> 00:11:29.96
They and they also were they were regimented and creative at the same time so

132
00:11:31.64 --> 00:11:37.48
Interesting dichotomy that you try to have to kind of have to have or if you really want to take it to the next level

133
00:11:38.12 --> 00:11:42.76
Back to the book anticipation the first basic way to adapt is to anticipate by which we mean to

134
00:11:43.32 --> 00:11:47.48
Introduce new method schemes and techniques for future use

135
00:11:48.28 --> 00:11:52.20
In order to anticipate we must be able to forecast future actions at least to some extent

136
00:11:52.20 --> 00:11:59.24
Our forecasts are usually based on past experiences often a forecast involves considering what we learned through trial and error

137
00:11:59.32 --> 00:12:02.12
In training exercises or actual combat and

138
00:12:02.68 --> 00:12:08.92
Excellent example of anticipation is the Marine Corps development of amphibious warfare techniques at Quantico

139
00:12:09.48 --> 00:12:18.84
During the 1920s and 30s these techniques proved to be essential to the success in World War II in both the Pacific and in Europe

140
00:12:18.84 --> 00:12:24.12
All planning at all echelons is a form of anticipatory

141
00:12:24.52 --> 00:12:36.28
Participation adaptation adapting our actions in advance another important tool for tactical adaptation is the use of immediate action drills or standard operating procedures

142
00:12:38.52 --> 00:12:40.36
Why do I always call it standard operating?

143
00:12:40.36 --> 00:12:46.52
They called it standing operating procedures. You think that's a misprint you think a misprint made it through the Marine Corps

144
00:12:46.52 --> 00:12:53.72
It's always been standard as far as I know. This is like a standing operating because I think we have a little misprint will will write to the editor

145
00:12:54.92 --> 00:12:58.60
Standard operating procedures. These are practice pre-design generic actions which cover

146
00:12:59.24 --> 00:13:01.24
Common situations

147
00:13:01.24 --> 00:13:10.12
Having a collection of these tools at our disposal allows us to react immediately in a coordinated way to a broad variety of tactical situations

148
00:13:10.12 --> 00:13:18.36
You meet eat action drills do not replace the need for tactical judgment. They merely provide a way to season initiative in the early stages of developing this other developing situation

149
00:13:18.36 --> 00:13:24.76
Until we can take more considered action. They provide the basis for adaptation

150
00:13:26.68 --> 00:13:31.000
Very important to have some good standard operating procedures

151
00:13:33.16 --> 00:13:35.16
with martial arts

152
00:13:35.88 --> 00:13:37.16
in the early

153
00:13:37.16 --> 00:13:44.12
90s in the in the seal teams. They were experimenting with a lot of different martial arts and part of

154
00:13:44.60 --> 00:13:46.44
some of the systems that they brought in

155
00:13:47.16 --> 00:13:52.12
Was they just had a standard immediate action drill that you are going to go through if

156
00:13:52.52 --> 00:13:59.72
X happened you are going to throw nine throat punches followed by a kick to the groin followed by a face rake

157
00:13:59.72 --> 00:14:01.72
They just and and

158
00:14:01.72 --> 00:14:07.08
If you if you if you did that if someone walks up to you in a bar and

159
00:14:07.72 --> 00:14:12.12
Shubs you and you deliver nine punches to the throat face rake kick to the groin

160
00:14:12.76 --> 00:14:16.76
Like and people say yeah, it works well, you know what you're right?

161
00:14:17.16 --> 00:14:21.96
That's that's actually true if you have a standard operating procedure that you're going to go to

162
00:14:22.12 --> 00:14:27.000
That's just hyper aggressive in a street fight. There's a decent chance it's gonna work

163
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.72
Unfortunately once that initial wall is over if you're not ready to adapt to that person that

164
00:14:34.36 --> 00:14:39.40
Cavers up grabs a hole to your whatever and start some maneuver on you well than you're you have a problem

165
00:14:39.48 --> 00:14:43.000
So there's a there's a chance it's gonna work but you have to be able to adapt afterwards

166
00:14:43.32 --> 00:14:48.20
Same thing in a firefight, you know someone starts shooting you we know the the Vietnam guys taught us

167
00:14:48.20 --> 00:14:52.76
And have closed environment like the jungle where there's no other friendly forces around and you're in a squad of

168
00:14:52.76 --> 00:14:59.000
See a squad of seals of eight guys you get contacted everyone drops down in their field of fire and dumb

169
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Samagging tilt was talking about that the friends when we're talking about that they would drop down

170
00:15:03.08 --> 00:15:09.24
Man it was crazy here that story where he says they all dump their mags at the same time and then there's silence

171
00:15:10.04 --> 00:15:15.96
As everyone's trying to do a mag change that silence which probably felt like 14 years was probably

172
00:15:15.96 --> 00:15:23.96
Probably probably three seconds it was probably three seconds and and and but that's the standard out same standard operating

173
00:15:23.96 --> 00:15:29.32
Precision oh we just got contacted we're gonna lay down some lead so you get that really good aggressive

174
00:15:29.96 --> 00:15:31.16
immediate action drill

175
00:15:31.16 --> 00:15:36.20
Then you have to be able to learn how to think and that's where some of those early martial arts systems

176
00:15:36.20 --> 00:15:42.44
They succeeded in that initial volley and then the adaptation piece if it went beyond that

177
00:15:42.52 --> 00:15:44.52
We're talking mission failure

178
00:15:44.52 --> 00:15:48.36
We used to teach at top again. I talked about this a lot when we would have

179
00:15:49.08 --> 00:15:51.88
You'd have a tactical situation SOPs for

180
00:15:52.52 --> 00:15:57.80
For your actions when you didn't know what to do so if you looked at a situation and didn't really understand what you should do

181
00:15:58.20 --> 00:16:01.64
You still have to do something going wings level and flying shit head is a death sentence

182
00:16:02.04 --> 00:16:08.68
So our SOP for reaction to being shot out was what we called lift vector on and pull basically means point of the guy pull as hard as you can

183
00:16:08.68 --> 00:16:15.56
We let's pull do pull closes the distance between the two views and moves the airplane from the piece of Scott that you're into some other piece of

184
00:16:15.56 --> 00:16:19.16
Sky and makes the closure happen as fast as you can to try to minimize the distance

185
00:16:19.48 --> 00:16:24.52
What you're trying to create a separation so if I get separation from you I can attack you and I if on the defender

186
00:16:24.52 --> 00:16:27.80
I want to close that separation and bring that fight down as close as I can

187
00:16:28.12 --> 00:16:32.92
But the reality is that me putting my lift vector on and pulling towards you isn't the right answer

188
00:16:33.40 --> 00:16:37.40
What I actually need to do is figure out I apply that SOP and as soon as I do that

189
00:16:37.40 --> 00:16:43.16
I need to engage my brain to think okay, now where do I need to really go which is maybe up an actress or some other reaction

190
00:16:43.32 --> 00:16:47.40
The SOP in an airplane was that maneuver which is no different than dump your mag

191
00:16:47.80 --> 00:16:52.92
It was to close the gap of time till you actually figured out what's going on what's a situation

192
00:16:52.92 --> 00:16:58.76
And that's the adaptation you're talking about the SOP really was just a gap filler until you could get your brain engaged to doing the right thing

193
00:16:58.76 --> 00:17:05.48
So you want to close the distance on the enemy. You want to get closer to them. Yeah, so if I am let's say you and I are across from each other

194
00:17:05.48 --> 00:17:10.68
And you're shooting you're gonna shoot at me and I see that you're in a position to employ a weapon against me

195
00:17:10.68 --> 00:17:15.56
I actually want to close the distance between you and me as fast as I can to get inside your your weapons range

196
00:17:15.56 --> 00:17:18.76
It's quickly as possible because if I extend away from that or do nothing

197
00:17:19.16 --> 00:17:21.96
You get more opportunity to get to more advantageous position

198
00:17:22.12 --> 00:17:24.92
But me pulling directly towards you isn't the right answer

199
00:17:24.92 --> 00:17:28.60
I don't know what the right if I knew what the right answer was I wouldn't be here in the first place

200
00:17:28.68 --> 00:17:32.88
So my SOP is I have to close the distance right away and the good pilots

201
00:17:32.88 --> 00:17:36.88
The amount of time was sometimes would take a half a second for they adjust that maneuver

202
00:17:37.04 --> 00:17:44.72
But that immediate action that SOP is left vector on a opponent airplane would you ever be able to be ahead of your SOP in other words?

203
00:17:45.52 --> 00:17:49.44
Yeah, you're laughing like I'm gonna. Yeah, no, no, I'm laughing because I think you know the answer

204
00:17:50.40 --> 00:17:55.04
Depending on who you're fighting if I'm fighting someone who is not as experienced and hasn't seen this before

205
00:17:55.04 --> 00:17:59.44
And doesn't have that role decks of can't anticipate because he hasn't seen it. I'm never reacting

206
00:17:59.44 --> 00:18:04.88
I'm never reacting to what he's doing. I'm always not just out in front of him. I'm moves out in front of him

207
00:18:04.88 --> 00:18:10.56
But if I was fighting against a guy who was at my level or better there are times he would do things that I had to react to and

208
00:18:10.96 --> 00:18:16.94
The time frame that takes me to react to an SOP to the right thing the short of that time frame the more likely is

209
00:18:16.94 --> 00:18:22.000
I'm gonna be successful and if I don't know what to do and I just spend the entire fight lift vector on and pull

210
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.12
I'm gonna lose and that SOP was something that eventually you actually got past and almost never had to do it

211
00:18:27.12 --> 00:18:30.000
Because you weren't there in the first place. You were thinking moves ahead and get there

212
00:18:30.32 --> 00:18:32.40
Yeah, so that's a good thing to think about too

213
00:18:32.40 --> 00:18:39.60
And it's good thing to think about from a self defense perspective martial arts wise like you should have some standard operating procedures some immediate action drills

214
00:18:39.84 --> 00:18:46.48
That you're gonna do that are just gonna get you and you know closing the distance for a jiu-jiu guy is real

215
00:18:46.88 --> 00:18:52.88
Instinctive if you watched the UFC or whatever a wrestler or a jiu-jiu guy once they start getting banged up

216
00:18:52.88 --> 00:18:57.44
And they don't really know what to do there instinct take over and they just shoot and close the distance and try and get in

217
00:18:57.84 --> 00:19:02.96
That's not always the best thing in a in a street fight in fact it often isn't what we want to do is break contact

218
00:19:02.96 --> 00:19:05.92
So you know think about that think about that with your

219
00:19:06.60 --> 00:19:09.04
Jiu-jitsu coach your martial arts instructor

220
00:19:09.20 --> 00:19:16.72
What is your move gonna do what's your immediate action drill when someone gets in your face when someone grabs you how you gonna break contact and

221
00:19:17.12 --> 00:19:19.12
Get away have a good

222
00:19:19.12 --> 00:19:21.84
SOP and a good immediate action drill for that

223
00:19:22.80 --> 00:19:23.60
All right

224
00:19:23.60 --> 00:19:27.36
same thing with boxing by the way, and I right you know when you see a guy in trouble

225
00:19:28.16 --> 00:19:32.16
In boxing yeah, you'll like try to hug him even though the other person necessarily the box

226
00:19:32.16 --> 00:19:37.76
Yeah, but oh, yeah, that's the thing to get him out of trouble. Yeah, so he can how you say like you are gazing your brain and

227
00:19:38.56 --> 00:19:42.64
You actually want to get inside the range of their weapons system

228
00:19:42.64 --> 00:19:48.56
Yeah, they more entire that doesn't work quite as well because you get inside and you're getting elbowed in the face or you're getting a need in the ribs

229
00:19:49.44 --> 00:19:53.84
You kind of need to the rib before yes, sir. Oh, that's not fun. No, it's enough

230
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.76
You don't even when you're watching a mojitai fight because they're so hard core

231
00:19:58.16 --> 00:20:02.56
They get need in the rib and you think all that must not hurt real bad. Yeah. Well, here's the thing

232
00:20:03.12 --> 00:20:05.12
In mojitai this is an actual like

233
00:20:05.60 --> 00:20:10.44
Thing you can't show when you you get hurt right like if you get hit in the legs legs

234
00:20:10.44 --> 00:20:16.12
Soaks too bad. Oh, yeah, yeah, but anything in the ribs. Oh, 100% but yeah, that need the oh, yeah, it's bad

235
00:20:16.12 --> 00:20:18.52
But you can't show pain in mojitai

236
00:20:18.84 --> 00:20:25.000
Like literally that's kind of the rule like if you show pain, it's like you fundamentally didn't follow the protocol

237
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.44
You know you seem saying it's like an official thing because when they see the pain

238
00:20:28.44 --> 00:20:32.20
They're just gonna go if you go oh dang that leg kick hurt even if you just go like this go

239
00:20:32.76 --> 00:20:35.88
Yeah, or even limp on it or if you see and you smile

240
00:20:35.88 --> 00:20:41.96
Which is your way and oh no that didn't hurt everyone. Oh, yes, and you see the leg kicks just keep coming like one dang

241
00:20:41.96 --> 00:20:45.56
They take him like even more leg kicks to that same leg every time it's like

242
00:20:46.20 --> 00:20:50.68
That's the SOP you see little little pain on the guys face whatever you just keep hitting that thing

243
00:20:50.92 --> 00:20:52.92
But yeah, there's another SOP in Thailand

244
00:20:53.40 --> 00:20:58.44
That I learned about well, it's it's maybe it's not in Thailand, but it's definitely with Thai food in America

245
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.24
You every Thai food? Yes, sir. All right

246
00:21:01.24 --> 00:21:09.88
So I get you know I I will up the level of spice sure one to 10 at the Thai restaurant that I go to and over a year

247
00:21:09.88 --> 00:21:15.48
I went you know from five to seven to nine one time I went in there and nine

248
00:21:15.48 --> 00:21:18.12
You know no factor eight no factor like taste good

249
00:21:18.12 --> 00:21:23.40
I went in there one time and he said well what type of spice would you like today sir and I said 10

250
00:21:25.32 --> 00:21:27.32
They made me something

251
00:21:27.32 --> 00:21:32.84
That was psycho like it was almost inedible. I ate it just out of

252
00:21:33.96 --> 00:21:42.36
Sheer yeah ego I just ate it, but I with my mouth was on fire and so the waitress like when I ordered it

253
00:21:42.36 --> 00:21:44.84
She kind of looked at me like this is not a good move

254
00:21:46.28 --> 00:21:50.28
But I didn't what I didn't realize so then the next time I came I said hey

255
00:21:51.24 --> 00:21:54.68
Last time I came I you know I asked for 10. I don't want 10 again

256
00:21:54.68 --> 00:22:02.60
I said when I asked for 10 is that like an insult slash challenge to the kitchen and she said oh, yes

257
00:22:03.72 --> 00:22:09.32
So so don't order 10 unless you want your face to be on fire and that makes sense too

258
00:22:09.32 --> 00:22:14.76
Because when you're over here like nine no factor, you know ten should be incrementally should be consistent

259
00:22:15.32 --> 00:22:22.36
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so the way nine was 10 should have been a little bit more right to the difference between eight and nine or even at least

260
00:22:22.36 --> 00:22:26.60
Establish some sort of a pattern. You see like if the increment between eight and nine is like a four

261
00:22:26.76 --> 00:22:30.68
Maybe nine and ten is like eight. Okay, I dig it, but that's all that fallong

262
00:22:30.76 --> 00:22:35.96
That's that's the the in Thailand they call the foreigners fallong. I mean I think it means foreign

263
00:22:36.68 --> 00:22:38.68
The rest early or just

264
00:22:38.68 --> 00:22:41.88
I won't say super positive, but no, it's it's

265
00:22:42.84 --> 00:22:49.72
Because you know when you go to Thailand and the fallong's go to they's the the fallong like a drunk European dude

266
00:22:49.72 --> 00:22:57.000
Is off like that little tie guy put me in the ring with him and they go okay? Okay? Okay, and they put the big German dude in there

267
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.72
Whatever who's not a fighter he's just a guy who's 200 and

268
00:23:02.68 --> 00:23:10.10
238 pounds of of beer and they put him in there against a 142 pound

269
00:23:10.44 --> 00:23:17.000
tie kid that just hacks him apart with with leg kicks and just annihilates him

270
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.12
So anyways, so that we can you at the tire right now

271
00:23:20.12 --> 00:23:26.60
Two pieces not with leg kicks, but with whatever spice they put in there so use caution

272
00:23:30.28 --> 00:23:32.28
Back to the book

273
00:23:36.04 --> 00:23:44.60
Improvisation so this is the other form the second basic way to adapt is to improvise to adjust to a situation on the spur of the moment without any

274
00:23:44.60 --> 00:23:51.000
Preparation like anticipation improvisation is the key to maneuver is key to maneuver warfare

275
00:23:51.32 --> 00:23:54.04
Improvisation requires creative intelligence

276
00:23:54.20 --> 00:23:57.72
Intelligent and experienced leaders who have an intuition

277
00:23:58.60 --> 00:24:02.04
Intuitive appreciation for what will work and what will not

278
00:24:02.84 --> 00:24:08.44
Improvisation is of critical importance to increasing speed it requires commanders who have his strong

279
00:24:08.44 --> 00:24:15.24
situational awareness and a firm understanding of their senior commanders intense so that they can adjust their own actions

280
00:24:15.72 --> 00:24:18.76
in accordance with the higher commanders desires

281
00:24:20.36 --> 00:24:29.48
Often we will find ourselves in a situation where our organic resources weapons vehicles and so on are not adequate to keep us moving fast

282
00:24:30.28 --> 00:24:32.12
in France 1940

283
00:24:32.12 --> 00:24:34.12
German general Heinz

284
00:24:34.12 --> 00:24:39.40
Guirdian put some of his infantry in common deered French buses

285
00:24:40.84 --> 00:24:47.32
On Grenada when army Rangers needed vehicles they took East German trucks belonging to the Grenadian army

286
00:24:47.32 --> 00:24:49.72
Sound on north of the box there is nothing

287
00:24:50.44 --> 00:24:54.76
Orthodox about failure due to an inability to adapt

288
00:24:57.40 --> 00:24:59.72
Improvisation and this is one of those ones where

289
00:24:59.72 --> 00:25:03.32
You this is where you start to see a

290
00:25:04.68 --> 00:25:09.72
Leader that can't that doesn't have the creative aspect to his thought process

291
00:25:10.20 --> 00:25:14.76
This is where you see when when the situation demands true improvisation

292
00:25:15.32 --> 00:25:19.72
This is where you see a little crack in the in the armor of the highly

293
00:25:20.68 --> 00:25:26.12
Concernions conscientious leader. Yeah. That's the guy you're talking about before and and both of these things

294
00:25:26.12 --> 00:25:29.52
And it should realize that these are both learned things.

295
00:25:29.52 --> 00:25:34.96
The ability to anticipate is not just some sort of magical vision that you're born with.

296
00:25:34.96 --> 00:25:37.16
They talk about reps over and over again.

297
00:25:37.16 --> 00:25:42.60
But even this idea of improvising, it's what is learned there as a recognition is, hey,

298
00:25:42.60 --> 00:25:45.88
my skill said here, my bag of tricks, I don't have what I need to actually make happen,

299
00:25:45.88 --> 00:25:46.88
what I need to have happen.

300
00:25:46.88 --> 00:25:48.92
I understand the intent, I don't have the resources to hand.

301
00:25:48.92 --> 00:25:52.96
So I actually need to recognize this is the time to improvise.

302
00:25:52.96 --> 00:25:57.72
And it's that rigid, conscientious thinking that doesn't allow you to sit, you know what?

303
00:25:57.72 --> 00:26:01.96
And it's not just totally winging it, it's not just on the fly, it's recognizing,

304
00:26:01.96 --> 00:26:05.80
I need to come up with a creative solution here because what I have available doesn't work.

305
00:26:05.80 --> 00:26:08.92
And those rigid leaders and I know who you're talking about, I've seen them throughout my career,

306
00:26:08.92 --> 00:26:11.88
they simply don't have that place where they can go.

307
00:26:11.88 --> 00:26:16.56
And you have to, when at times in a most critical, you have to be able to go there.

308
00:26:16.56 --> 00:26:21.28
And the good leaders, that's the creative piece that they need to be to be to be tapped into in a career.

309
00:26:21.28 --> 00:26:29.20
You know what I notice is, if you can't detach from the situation, you won't be able to be creative.

310
00:26:29.20 --> 00:26:37.000
When I'm looking at a problem, I sometimes have to consciously detach from the situation

311
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.60
and take a different look at it.

312
00:26:39.60 --> 00:26:45.24
Because what you will see, we all are kind of brainwashed into just pattern recognition

313
00:26:45.24 --> 00:26:51.36
and then applying the appropriate known tested solution.

314
00:26:51.36 --> 00:26:57.16
But when you look at something, you don't really see a pattern what you do is you try and apply a pattern that you've seen in the past.

315
00:26:57.16 --> 00:27:00.04
And that's a positive thing that makes us.

316
00:27:00.04 --> 00:27:02.64
But sometimes that pattern is just too far off.

317
00:27:02.64 --> 00:27:04.000
It's just not quite there.

318
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.36
And all you'll do is try and apply the prescription that you have to that problem.

319
00:27:10.36 --> 00:27:12.04
And it's not going to work out.

320
00:27:12.04 --> 00:27:19.64
And for me, when I see a problem, I always have to say, okay, take a step back and look at this from a different angle.

321
00:27:19.64 --> 00:27:27.64
Because if you don't do that, if you don't do that, you're not going to see how far off your pattern recognition actually is.

322
00:27:27.64 --> 00:27:29.44
And it can be far off.

323
00:27:29.44 --> 00:27:30.44
Yeah.

324
00:27:30.44 --> 00:27:34.24
And sometimes see that pattern recognition, that is a good thing like you described,

325
00:27:34.24 --> 00:27:37.60
tells you, oh, I need this, I need air support here.

326
00:27:37.60 --> 00:27:38.72
I need heavy machine guns here.

327
00:27:38.72 --> 00:27:40.12
Okay, I have this, the answer.

328
00:27:40.12 --> 00:27:42.72
It's like, well, guess what, you don't have that resource today.

329
00:27:42.72 --> 00:27:46.32
That thing that you say you need, it doesn't exist.

330
00:27:46.32 --> 00:27:48.16
So what are you going to do now?

331
00:27:48.16 --> 00:27:54.72
And that's when you see, you can see people panic in those situations because they don't think there's a solution available to them.

332
00:27:54.72 --> 00:27:57.28
And the reality is, there is, if you can do what you just described,

333
00:27:57.28 --> 00:28:00.72
but they think pattern recognition situation dictates this is what I use.

334
00:28:00.72 --> 00:28:05.16
And if that tool that they are used to having doesn't exist for them there, that's when they panic.

335
00:28:05.16 --> 00:28:09.24
And that's when that's the worst case situation for them is they don't think there's an out.

336
00:28:09.24 --> 00:28:11.80
You can actually surround yourself with people that can help you there.

337
00:28:11.80 --> 00:28:15.64
You know, you can actually have other people say, hey, I saw this on a way in.

338
00:28:15.64 --> 00:28:17.28
I think there's a solution here.

339
00:28:17.28 --> 00:28:20.68
And that's where the humility piece requires is, hey, what do you see?

340
00:28:20.68 --> 00:28:28.80
Man, I see this and somebody else can actually lead you down that road and set up just refusing the bud from your position and setting your whole team up to fail.

341
00:28:28.80 --> 00:28:29.76
Not a good plan.

342
00:28:29.76 --> 00:28:30.76
No.

343
00:28:30.76 --> 00:28:33.16
In Provis, back to the book.

344
00:28:33.16 --> 00:28:41.56
For instance, take the situation in which Marines of the second baton fifth Marine Regiment found themselves in the Battle of Way City,

345
00:28:41.56 --> 00:28:45.28
Republican Vietnam in February of 1968.

346
00:28:45.28 --> 00:28:51.96
One of their first objectives was to retake the city's treasury building, which was heavily defended by the North Vietnamese.

347
00:28:51.96 --> 00:28:58.84
Prior to the assault, the Marines were disappointed to see that their mortar fire was having little effect on the building or its defenders.

348
00:28:58.84 --> 00:29:07.64
In the executive officer found some US tear gas canisters and dispensers in the military assistance compound they had reoccupied.

349
00:29:07.64 --> 00:29:15.64
Realizing the North Vietnamese lacked gas masks, the Marines proceeded to lob tear gas canisters into the treasury building.

350
00:29:15.64 --> 00:29:27.24
As a result of the executive officer's quick thinking and adaptation, the North Vietnamese quickly vacated the building and the Marines secured the objective with minimal casualties.

351
00:29:27.24 --> 00:29:29.84
That seems real obvious when you're looking back at it.

352
00:29:29.84 --> 00:29:33.24
But this is one of those situations where exactly what you were just talking about.

353
00:29:33.24 --> 00:29:42.64
If you, I could, and I would say you can watch and I have watched many military or leaders in that exact situation.

354
00:29:42.64 --> 00:29:44.56
When I was running training, I saw it all the time.

355
00:29:44.56 --> 00:29:48.32
These guys would, they know what the standard operating procedure is and they would just stick with it.

356
00:29:48.32 --> 00:29:56.64
I would give all kinds of answers would be floating around the battlefield form and they wouldn't seem until you learned to take a step back.

357
00:29:56.64 --> 00:30:00.64
So this is a great example and it seems so obvious.

358
00:30:00.64 --> 00:30:03.24
But it's not that obvious when you're in the situation.

359
00:30:03.24 --> 00:30:09.84
And when you're emotional about the situation, yeah, it's really hard to see that when you're emotional.

360
00:30:09.84 --> 00:30:11.36
Back to the book, flexible plans.

361
00:30:11.36 --> 00:30:15.56
We have several techniques to help us develop adaptability.

362
00:30:15.56 --> 00:30:17.56
One of these is to make flexible plans.

363
00:30:17.56 --> 00:30:24.64
Flexible, flexible plans can enhance adaptability by establishing a course of action that provides for multiple options.

364
00:30:24.64 --> 00:30:35.64
For example, a blocking position that covers two avenues of approach from the same location instead of only one provides the flexibility to adapt to an enemy coming through either avenue.

365
00:30:35.64 --> 00:30:42.64
We can increase our flexibility by providing branches for current and future operations.

366
00:30:42.64 --> 00:30:51.64
And those are like little branch plans that just branch off of all the main plan branches are options.

367
00:30:51.64 --> 00:30:58.64
We're going to be changing this position, orientation, strength, movement or accepting or declining battle.

368
00:30:58.64 --> 00:31:02.64
To deal with changing conditions on the battlefield that may affect the plan.

369
00:31:02.64 --> 00:31:13.64
Flexibility can also be increased by providing sequels for the current and future operation sequels are courses of action to follow probable battle or engagement outcomes.

370
00:31:13.64 --> 00:31:19.64
Victory, defeat or stalemate.

371
00:31:19.64 --> 00:31:22.64
I have a note here that I wrote to myself.

372
00:31:22.64 --> 00:31:27.64
And the note that I wrote to myself, it says, it's okay.

373
00:31:27.64 --> 00:31:29.64
And I put these in quotes.

374
00:31:29.64 --> 00:31:34.64
It's okay. Then we will do something else effective that moves us toward our goal.

375
00:31:34.64 --> 00:31:38.64
That's like such a good answer.

376
00:31:38.64 --> 00:31:41.64
Oh, we've become stagnant.

377
00:31:41.64 --> 00:31:42.64
It's okay.

378
00:31:42.64 --> 00:31:47.64
Like think about that from a, from your an all leadership position or no, think about it from a subordinate position.

379
00:31:47.64 --> 00:31:50.64
You hit a wall and you can't get through.

380
00:31:50.64 --> 00:31:52.64
And you look at your leader and your leader says, it's okay.

381
00:31:52.64 --> 00:31:56.64
We're going to do something else that's going to be effective that's going to move us toward our goal.

382
00:31:56.64 --> 00:32:02.64
Oh, and that seems, it's really easy to look at these things and say, well, that's real obvious.

383
00:32:02.64 --> 00:32:07.64
I'm telling you, it is not obvious unless you train yourself to start thinking that way.

384
00:32:07.64 --> 00:32:09.64
It is not obvious.

385
00:32:09.64 --> 00:32:11.64
There's a reason that's in this book.

386
00:32:11.64 --> 00:32:13.64
It's in this book because it's hard.

387
00:32:13.64 --> 00:32:18.64
As simple as that sounds, build a plan and have a whole bunch of options available to you when your plan doesn't work.

388
00:32:18.64 --> 00:32:30.64
That's written down in the Marine Corps tactics manual, specifically because they know how hard this is, especially in combat.

389
00:32:30.64 --> 00:32:31.64
Back to the book.

390
00:32:31.64 --> 00:32:36.64
The value of branches and sequels is that they prepare us for several different actions.

391
00:32:36.64 --> 00:32:40.64
We should keep the number of branches and sequels to a relative few.

392
00:32:40.64 --> 00:32:46.64
And and late for nights talked about them that in the dark out of me leadership where people go, okay, you want to see branch plans.

393
00:32:46.64 --> 00:32:49.64
I got some branch plans and they create 50 of them.

394
00:32:49.64 --> 00:32:50.64
You need three.

395
00:32:50.64 --> 00:32:50.64
Yeah.

396
00:32:50.64 --> 00:32:51.64
You need two.

397
00:32:51.64 --> 00:32:52.64
You need four.

398
00:32:52.64 --> 00:32:54.64
You don't need 50.

399
00:32:54.64 --> 00:32:55.64
Back to the book.

400
00:32:55.64 --> 00:33:01.64
We should not try to develop so many branches and sequels that we cannot adequately train, plan, train, or prepare for them for any of them.

401
00:33:01.64 --> 00:33:06.64
And what I found even on top of that is when you have multiple branches.

402
00:33:06.64 --> 00:33:10.64
And you rehearse them all. No one knows what's actually happening.

403
00:33:10.64 --> 00:33:14.64
You know, if you rehearse your primary, this is what you should do.

404
00:33:14.64 --> 00:33:16.64
You should rehearse your primary one.

405
00:33:16.64 --> 00:33:23.64
Like 10 times your secondary one three times and your tertiary one once as a walk through.

406
00:33:23.64 --> 00:33:24.64
Yeah.

407
00:33:24.64 --> 00:33:28.64
And you should do them in reverse or order or at least maybe not reverse order.

408
00:33:28.64 --> 00:33:35.64
But you practice your primary one five times three times on your secondary one time on your tertiary five more times on your primary.

409
00:33:35.64 --> 00:33:40.64
That's where you want them to the guys to come out the gate on otherwise.

410
00:33:40.64 --> 00:33:45.64
You're going to get half the guys do it one and half the guys doing something else.

411
00:33:45.64 --> 00:33:47.64
It's a nightmare.

412
00:33:47.64 --> 00:33:48.64
Back to the book.

413
00:33:48.64 --> 00:33:56.64
The skillful well thought out use of branches and sequels becomes an important means of anticipating future courses of action.

414
00:33:56.64 --> 00:34:02.64
This anticipation helps accelerate the decision cycle and therefore increase the tempo.

415
00:34:02.64 --> 00:34:06.64
This idea of anticipation.

416
00:34:06.64 --> 00:34:11.64
I mean, what you're saying is that I know what the enemy is going to do.

417
00:34:11.64 --> 00:34:15.64
And when you're doing GJ2 and you're good at GJ2, I used to describe GJ2 and I used to say,

418
00:34:15.64 --> 00:34:19.64
When you're good at GJ2, you can see the future.

419
00:34:19.64 --> 00:34:28.64
Like if I roll with you Dave, because I've been training for a long time, there's a 90% chance that I know what you're about to do.

420
00:34:28.64 --> 00:34:35.64
Like when you were going up against a top gun student that had just showed up, there's a night well, do you tell me?

421
00:34:35.64 --> 00:34:38.64
No, there's like a 90% chance that this guy is going to do.

422
00:34:38.64 --> 00:34:40.64
When I do this, he's going to do that.

423
00:34:40.64 --> 00:34:48.64
So this idea that you begin to be able to predict what the future holds is.

424
00:34:48.64 --> 00:34:49.64
Think about it.

425
00:34:49.64 --> 00:34:51.64
Think about that's what happens in GJ2.

426
00:34:51.64 --> 00:34:52.64
That's what happens in GJ2.

427
00:34:52.64 --> 00:34:57.64
That's what makes you get beaten GJ2 is that person you're going against knows what you're going to do.

428
00:34:57.64 --> 00:35:00.64
And it's waiting there for you to do it and submit you.

429
00:35:00.64 --> 00:35:02.64
That's what happens with tactics.

430
00:35:02.64 --> 00:35:06.64
If you can anticipate what the enemy is going to do, you can be waiting for them.

431
00:35:06.64 --> 00:35:08.64
And we used to set operations up like that.

432
00:35:08.64 --> 00:35:13.64
Hey, when we set the breach here, that's going to drive people in this direction, out of the building,

433
00:35:13.64 --> 00:35:16.64
if they try to escape, they're going to go off this back door, this back window,

434
00:35:16.64 --> 00:35:18.64
boom, we'll be waiting right there for them or whatever.

435
00:35:18.64 --> 00:35:21.64
Like that's how we do it.

436
00:35:21.64 --> 00:35:26.64
So this idea of anticipation, man, if you can, if you can dedicate a little bit of energy to the future,

437
00:35:26.64 --> 00:35:33.64
you can dedicate a little bit of time to think about what your competitor, what the enemy is going to do.

438
00:35:33.64 --> 00:35:42.64
You're going to set yourself up for a, what's the video game term echo Charles for like a total of, is it total victory?

439
00:35:42.64 --> 00:35:43.64
Flallus victory.

440
00:35:43.64 --> 00:35:44.64
Flallus victory.

441
00:35:44.64 --> 00:35:45.64
I knew there was a better term.

442
00:35:45.64 --> 00:35:46.64
Thank you.

443
00:35:46.64 --> 00:35:49.64
Well, go back from Hawaii to give us this information.

444
00:35:49.64 --> 00:35:51.64
I never would have known that answer.

445
00:35:51.64 --> 00:35:52.64
Yes.

446
00:35:52.64 --> 00:35:54.64
Well done.

447
00:35:54.64 --> 00:35:58.64
Flexible plans avoid unnecessary detail.

448
00:35:58.64 --> 00:36:04.64
That not only consumes time in their development, but has a tendency to restrict subordinates latitude.

449
00:36:04.64 --> 00:36:11.64
How often do we see the, the, the leader that thinks that the more detail they put into a plan,

450
00:36:11.64 --> 00:36:16.64
the better off they're going to be and the better people are going to understand it all the time.

451
00:36:16.64 --> 00:36:19.64
That comment about your subordinates latitude.

452
00:36:19.64 --> 00:36:26.64
The goal should actually be is to tell them what to do the least amount of time and give them the most latitude possible.

453
00:36:26.64 --> 00:36:30.64
That should be your goal to let them figure out what it is you're going to do.

454
00:36:30.64 --> 00:36:35.64
That comment that latitude comment is something that's so critical for leaders.

455
00:36:35.64 --> 00:36:37.64
Give your, your folks latitude to do that.

456
00:36:37.64 --> 00:36:39.64
I like the way they just called unnecessary detail.

457
00:36:39.64 --> 00:36:42.64
And this is one of those things where in the military,

458
00:36:42.64 --> 00:36:53.64
the American attitude of life is if a little is good, then more is better, and if more is better, then just max it out to the end degree.

459
00:36:53.64 --> 00:36:58.64
And I saw that over and over again, and we've wrote about our next dream ownership planning.

460
00:36:58.64 --> 00:36:59.64
It's like,

461
00:36:59.64 --> 00:37:11.64
life and Seth were so used to these 200 power points slide briefs. And I was telling them, look, we're not doing that. Put a map up on the wall, talk to guys.

462
00:37:11.64 --> 00:37:15.64
Life and Seth were actually scared for their careers.

463
00:37:15.64 --> 00:37:20.64
When the commanding officer was coming up to to sitting on their briefs,

464
00:37:20.64 --> 00:37:28.64
they were worried about what was going to happen to their careers because they wanted to build 200 power points slides.

465
00:37:28.64 --> 00:37:32.64
It slides for a brief on a reconnaissance in the woods.

466
00:37:32.64 --> 00:37:34.64
That's what they wanted to do.

467
00:37:34.64 --> 00:37:49.64
So what they realized is that all that detail, all that use, they've been driven, they thought, you know, at somewhere along the line in the, in the, in the seal community, someone said, oh, well, you put some good detail in there, put more.

468
00:37:49.64 --> 00:37:54.64
And then a year later someone also say and put more, and then a year later someone's put more.

469
00:37:54.64 --> 00:37:59.64
And that's how you end up with 200 slides that no one understands.

470
00:37:59.64 --> 00:38:01.64
Totally ridiculous.

471
00:38:01.64 --> 00:38:03.64
Back to the book.

472
00:38:03.64 --> 00:38:11.64
Instead, flexible plans lay out what needs to be accomplished, but leave the manner of accomplishment to subordinates, which is what you just said.

473
00:38:11.64 --> 00:38:17.64
This allows subordinates the flexibility to deal with a broader range of circumstances.

474
00:38:17.64 --> 00:38:22.64
Flexible plans are plans that can be easily changed.

475
00:38:22.64 --> 00:38:25.64
Plans that require coordination are said to be coupled.

476
00:38:25.64 --> 00:38:34.64
If all parts of a plan are too tightly coupled, the plan is harder to change because changing anyone part of the plan means changing all the other parts.

477
00:38:34.64 --> 00:38:40.64
Instead, we should try and develop modular loosely connected plans.

478
00:38:40.64 --> 00:38:45.64
Then if we change or modify any one part of the plan, it does not directly affect all the other parts.

479
00:38:45.64 --> 00:38:50.64
This is why I talked about a little bit on one of our earlier podcasts from this book is.

480
00:38:50.64 --> 00:38:56.64
I would try and keep my unit integrity, my fire team integrity together as much as I could.

481
00:38:56.64 --> 00:39:02.64
So that way, if something changed, it was really easy to say, okay, fire teams two and three you're doing this now.

482
00:39:02.64 --> 00:39:08.64
And not putting little special teams together for every people like to put together little special teams for everything.

483
00:39:08.64 --> 00:39:14.64
No, use the team, use the team that's used to working with each other.

484
00:39:14.64 --> 00:39:19.64
Finally, flexible plans should be simple plans.

485
00:39:19.64 --> 00:39:26.64
Simple plans are easier to adapt to the rapidly changing complex and fluid situations that we experience in combat.

486
00:39:26.64 --> 00:39:36.64
Man, the idea that keeping the idea of keeping your plan simple.

487
00:39:36.64 --> 00:39:45.64
You know, when I would be going through training, when I would be getting judged by the training cadre, that was such a big advantage for me.

488
00:39:45.64 --> 00:39:49.64
There's to be like, oh, yeah, this is what we're going to do. Guys, we're going to get online here. We're going to move through the target.

489
00:39:49.64 --> 00:39:53.64
We're going to stay in fire team integrity once one on the other side of the target will call see.

490
00:39:53.64 --> 00:40:00.64
It was like these basic plans that it didn't matter what we encountered on the target every it was it was almost like I was cheating.

491
00:40:00.64 --> 00:40:02.64
It was almost like I was cheating.

492
00:40:02.64 --> 00:40:07.64
And you know what, what you know what they do, they lure you in to coming up with a complex plan.

493
00:40:07.64 --> 00:40:13.64
They go, hey, Jocca, we're going to give you guys all day today to plan this.

494
00:40:13.64 --> 00:40:21.64
And they think they're doing your favor and they're thinking that that when you come up with a more complex plan that it's going to be better, they actually think that.

495
00:40:21.64 --> 00:40:26.64
And I said, okay, cool. I'm still going to plan it in 13 minutes.

496
00:40:26.64 --> 00:40:31.64
And once we get the plan done, you know, okay, well, we'll add some detail to it.

497
00:40:31.64 --> 00:40:37.64
But the essential plan, 13 minutes, nine minutes. Let me look at the target for nine minutes.

498
00:40:37.64 --> 00:40:40.64
And I'm going to tell you exactly how this thing is going to go down.

499
00:40:40.64 --> 00:40:46.64
And the simplicity that you keep such a huge advantage over it's cheating. It's almost cheating.

500
00:40:46.64 --> 00:40:52.64
It is. We talked about this in business all the time. This idea of of simple one of the laws that we talk about it.

501
00:40:52.64 --> 00:40:57.64
And I'll ask the question that I'll have key leaders that bring us in and we'll roll with them and I'll say simply.

502
00:40:57.64 --> 00:41:04.64
Hey, why is it important for the plan to be simple enough that everybody on your team, especially at the lowest level of your team understands it.

503
00:41:04.64 --> 00:41:09.64
And they won't really know the answer and they'll think, well, it helps.

504
00:41:09.64 --> 00:41:14.64
And if you don't want everybody to understand that plan at the lowest level, is it, those are people going to be out there doing the rule work.

505
00:41:14.64 --> 00:41:23.64
They're the ones that are actually doing the work, not you as the key leader, not, and if they don't understand what to do, the simple thing is they won't know what to do.

506
00:41:23.64 --> 00:41:26.64
And you'll be stuck solving all the problems all day. And that's what we see these leaders.

507
00:41:26.64 --> 00:41:30.64
I'm constantly answering questions from all my people. It's like, because they don't understand what to do.

508
00:41:30.64 --> 00:41:36.64
And they're at the point of friction. And if your plan was actually less complex, it would help them more.

509
00:41:36.64 --> 00:41:40.64
And they think, no, I need to give them more details more information. That's actually not what they need.

510
00:41:40.64 --> 00:41:44.64
They need to just understand what you're trying to get accomplished and let them do the work.

511
00:41:44.64 --> 00:41:52.64
It can be counter-intuitive. It can be counter-intuitive because someone will see their subordinates go out to do something and they miss the mark.

512
00:41:52.64 --> 00:41:55.64
And so what they do is they try and drive more detail. They don't look.

513
00:41:55.64 --> 00:41:59.64
There's obviously a dichotomy. There's an encounter to where you're not giving them enough information.

514
00:41:59.64 --> 00:42:03.64
They don't understand what's going on. They don't understand what the objective is.

515
00:42:03.64 --> 00:42:08.64
That can happen. It usually happens the other way though. Totally.

516
00:42:08.64 --> 00:42:13.64
Next section in this book is called decentralization.

517
00:42:13.64 --> 00:42:21.64
Another excellent way to improve adaptability is to decentralize decision making authority as much as each situation allows.

518
00:42:21.64 --> 00:42:30.64
This means that commanders on the scene and closest to the events have the latitude to deal with the situation as required on their own authority.

519
00:42:30.64 --> 00:42:35.64
But always in accordance with the higher commanders intent.

520
00:42:35.64 --> 00:42:38.64
This decentralization speeds up reaction time.

521
00:42:38.64 --> 00:42:42.64
We don't have to wait for information to flow up to a higher command in order to flow back down.

522
00:42:42.64 --> 00:42:48.64
It increases responsiveness of the organization which in turn increases adaptability.

523
00:42:48.64 --> 00:42:58.64
Decentralizing control through the use of mission orders is one of the tools we use to maximize our ability to adapt.

524
00:42:58.64 --> 00:43:03.64
And this is the fourth law of combat decentralized command.

525
00:43:03.64 --> 00:43:18.64
Confidence in the abilities of subordinates plays an important part in decentralization leaders who have confidence in the capabilities of their subordinates will feel more comfortable in granting them greater latitude in accomplishing tasks.

526
00:43:18.64 --> 00:43:24.64
So that's what you have to do. You have to build up that confidence in your subordinates.

527
00:43:24.64 --> 00:43:30.64
And once you have confidence in your subordinates you can let them run. You can get out of their way actually.

528
00:43:30.64 --> 00:43:37.64
And for them to be confident in themselves as well that they can actually actually do that understanding the big intent and that they can do that themselves.

529
00:43:37.64 --> 00:43:46.64
This book is making this manual is making the connection between the need to be creative and the need to let your people be creative.

530
00:43:46.64 --> 00:43:56.64
And centralization and giving them too much detail to actually stifles a thing you need from them the most which is creativity and latitude when they're at the point of friction, which you can't be as leader all the time with them.

531
00:43:56.64 --> 00:43:58.64
They're going to be there on their own more often than not.

532
00:43:58.64 --> 00:44:05.64
And you actually have to cultivate that well in advance or they are going to freeze and they're going to they can have too much friction. They won't know what to do and it matters the most.

533
00:44:05.64 --> 00:44:13.64
And you won't be able to help them. I'm sure you saw that all the time as a mission lead at top gone. I'd have six different elements dealing with six different problems.

534
00:44:13.64 --> 00:44:20.64
And I couldn't be usually not at any of them. Maybe I could be with one if I was happy to be at the right place in the right time in my airplane.

535
00:44:20.64 --> 00:44:26.64
But if something happened critical 6070 miles away, I can't influence that. I can't help them with that.

536
00:44:26.64 --> 00:44:33.64
This idea of creativity. That's the confidence that you're talking about in them being able to solve their own problems and when you see it.

537
00:44:33.64 --> 00:44:42.64
As a leader, that's what led you step back. It's awesome to watch when leaders figure that out. Oh, you just you train them and just let them do their job and it worked out how that make you feel.

538
00:44:42.64 --> 00:44:43.64
Awesome.

539
00:44:43.64 --> 00:44:48.64
Some pragmatic kind of tactical level talk here.

540
00:44:48.64 --> 00:45:01.64
If you have your subordinates and they don't accomplish the mission the way they should or they make some bad decisions and your instinct is okay. What I need to do is give them more detailed commands.

541
00:45:01.64 --> 00:45:09.64
Well, that's not the right answer. So what is the right answer? The right answer is what you want to do is you need to make sure that they understand what your command is intent was.

542
00:45:09.64 --> 00:45:22.64
You need to make sure that you've given them the training so that they learn to recognize patterns. You need to make sure you go give them the training so that they learn that part of creativity.

543
00:45:22.64 --> 00:45:28.64
You need to make sure that they understand that what you want them to do out on the battlefield is to actually lead.

544
00:45:28.64 --> 00:45:31.64
Because a lot of times people don't understand that.

545
00:45:31.64 --> 00:45:46.64
What they think they should do is wait for you to tell them what to do. That's the breakdown. So the it's one of those moments where you need to look when your team doesn't do what you want them to do and your instinct is I need to tell them what to do more.

546
00:45:46.64 --> 00:45:48.64
That's the wrong instinct.

547
00:45:48.64 --> 00:45:54.64
What you need to do it's not that you need to just let them do whatever they want because they've already proved they just prove that they don't know how to do that.

548
00:45:54.64 --> 00:46:18.64
But what you need to do now is you need to train them to think you need to train them to be creative. You need to train them to follow up their immediate action drills and their standard operating procedures with an actual assessment of what is really happening and make some decisions based on what they've been trained to do, what the commanders intent is, what the survivability of the mission is like all those things they have to learn to think.

549
00:46:18.64 --> 00:46:42.64
I got to see this over and over again in my leadership laboratory running the West Coast seal training. I got to see it over and over again. You could see someone in their first block of training in unit level training their first block of training you would see a young seal leader who would completely lock up mental lock up when things started going sideways and believe me they would go sideways mental lock up.

550
00:46:42.64 --> 00:46:58.64
You fast forward I'd go out to the next block of training all of a sudden you'd see oh a little spark a little something a little maybe a little decision a hesitant decision but a decision you go out to the last block of training something something it hasn't even gone wrong yet it is beginning to go wrong and they go hey.

551
00:46:58.64 --> 00:47:12.64
We do solve that building right now and you go okay this person's got it so you can absolutely get better at this but the way you do it is not by providing more direction it's actually by providing the proper training because it's not nothing

552
00:47:12.64 --> 00:47:41.64
that's what I want to point out what I want to make is it's not when I say hey if your team isn't doing what you want to do give them less direction that's not the answer it. The answer is give them less direction and give them the training given the mindset given the authority given the repetitions given the pattern recognition given the standard operating procedure and the immediate action drill and I've talked about this before part of the immediate action drill that you need to have is what you're going to do when you don't know what's going on

553
00:47:41.64 --> 00:47:56.64
because there's a process that you can follow when you don't know what is happening what you need to do if I start getting shot at and I don't know what's happening okay what am I going to do and I'm going to start and I got reload another magazine and shoot it no I'm absolutely not going to do that.

554
00:47:56.64 --> 00:48:17.64
I'm going to take a step back I'm going to get off the firing line I'm going to high port my weapon I'm going to look to my left I'm going to look to my right I'm going to assess where my guys are make sure I know that then I'm going to start assessing where the enemy is once I've done that guess what I'm going to do I'm going to make the little littleist move that I can possibly make that's going to move me in the direction that I suspect is the right way to go.

555
00:48:17.64 --> 00:48:33.64
So I'm going to make one small movement that I think is right I'm not going to commit to it 100% but I'm going to make one small movement once we made that one small movement and it's proves that maybe I'm I was right in my suspicion cool now I'll make a bolder movement will continue in that direction.

556
00:48:33.64 --> 00:48:47.64
But you can do that you can develop a standard operating procedure an immediate action drill of what to do when you don't know what to do.

557
00:48:47.64 --> 00:49:07.64
And you did your immediate action drill which was turn towards them. Then what's your next what's the next steps that you take so you don't know what's happening you do your immediate action drill so you had to have some kind of thing that you did I mean you already said it earlier you started looking around figuring out what you're going to do next.

558
00:49:07.64 --> 00:49:23.64
Funny because as you as you were going what you just described I was thinking about top gun I started thinking about you did so I was thinking about our time and remedy I was thinking about business all that that thing you just described that template fits in all those different places at the same time and it's it's really how I was describing that that immediate action.

559
00:49:23.64 --> 00:49:24.76
of the time like you just describe learning. You did that too and like kind of understanding the way before you get templates like didn't you, postin get foi no way the unfamiliar said that that the way you

560
00:49:24.76 --> 00:49:42.64
drop. And you can dograss where stuff is playing. Like you, you know you've found some Frozen C shape that you're going to be lost.

561
00:49:42.64 --> 00:49:45.20
immediately put that person in a position where he's uncomfortable.

562
00:49:45.20 --> 00:49:49.60
Not so much that he can make a mistake that's going to be catastrophic for the squadron.

563
00:49:49.60 --> 00:49:53.64
I wouldn't put him in a situation that is so far out of his comfort zone that he can make a decision

564
00:49:53.64 --> 00:49:56.20
that will hurt the team so bad that it's not recoverable.

565
00:49:56.20 --> 00:50:00.44
But you described it, people can learn and have to learn how to be creative.

566
00:50:00.44 --> 00:50:04.40
And the really short answer is, what do I do once I get past that initial move is?

567
00:50:04.40 --> 00:50:06.52
I think that's creative.

568
00:50:06.52 --> 00:50:08.32
I look out and think, what do I need to do?

569
00:50:08.32 --> 00:50:11.68
I take all those different pieces together, the more experience I am, the easier it is.

570
00:50:11.68 --> 00:50:13.92
And I figure, okay, I need to stop this.

571
00:50:13.92 --> 00:50:17.16
This has been a good intermediate answer, but it's not the right answer.

572
00:50:17.16 --> 00:50:18.80
And now I need to move in this other direction.

573
00:50:18.80 --> 00:50:22.000
Or pull in some other resource, tell another airplane was going on.

574
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.76
Call a ground, whatever that answer is, the answer is different every single time.

575
00:50:26.76 --> 00:50:30.12
The answer is actually think, and you talked about situation on Warnus 2.

576
00:50:30.12 --> 00:50:32.76
The more you know what's going on around you, the easier the answer is.

577
00:50:32.76 --> 00:50:37.72
And the only way to get situation on Warnus is to put yourself in those situations over and over and over again.

578
00:50:37.72 --> 00:50:39.60
So you can anticipate what you need to do.

579
00:50:39.60 --> 00:50:44.56
The idea for me is, and for you, it's what you just described as well.

580
00:50:44.56 --> 00:50:48.48
Well, and I think you just described as, is you're going to immediately back into the

581
00:50:48.48 --> 00:50:52.88
Udolub to orient yourself to what's going on, decide what you're going to do next and act.

582
00:50:52.88 --> 00:50:57.68
But that orient piece that you're, once you've made your initial immediate action drill,

583
00:50:57.68 --> 00:51:00.36
okay, cool, you're immediate, that's act, right?

584
00:51:00.36 --> 00:51:01.84
You just did an act.

585
00:51:01.84 --> 00:51:02.84
And now what are you going to do?

586
00:51:02.84 --> 00:51:07.28
You're going to orient yourself to where you are now, which is going to look around.

587
00:51:07.28 --> 00:51:13.60
For me, taking a step back, going to high port and looking around, if I could get a

588
00:51:13.60 --> 00:51:20.76
young leader to do that, if I could get a young leader to do that, it was like I took them

589
00:51:20.76 --> 00:51:32.000
from having a garbage can over their head to standing on a mountaintop with thermal vision.

590
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.20
That's what it seemed like.

591
00:51:34.20 --> 00:51:41.32
Because when you are wrapped up in that situation, you cannot see anything.

592
00:51:41.32 --> 00:51:46.08
You might as well have a garbage can over your head.

593
00:51:46.08 --> 00:51:51.56
If the minute you take a step back, you can see everything.

594
00:51:51.56 --> 00:51:55.52
So once I could get someone to, to make that little transition and sometimes it was pretty

595
00:51:55.52 --> 00:51:57.68
easy, sometimes it was pretty hard.

596
00:51:57.68 --> 00:52:03.16
You know, we, many times, gave the young leaders, you know, a stick guns that didn't

597
00:52:03.16 --> 00:52:04.16
shoot.

598
00:52:04.16 --> 00:52:07.24
Go, man, I'm telling you, you cannot be shooting this thing.

599
00:52:07.24 --> 00:52:08.80
What you need to do is be looking around.

600
00:52:08.80 --> 00:52:13.88
But once you make that trip, that's like the, so for me, the immediate action drill for

601
00:52:13.88 --> 00:52:18.32
the immediate action drill for I don't know what's happening is step back, turn my head,

602
00:52:18.32 --> 00:52:23.76
physically look around and assess what's happening and then make the, the smallest move,

603
00:52:23.76 --> 00:52:28.68
I can possibly make towards the direction I suspect is correct.

604
00:52:28.68 --> 00:52:31.92
The beauty of what you just said is the immediate action and the airplane that I described

605
00:52:31.92 --> 00:52:37.40
earlier, that lift that run and pull, that's what allows you to stick, to take a step

606
00:52:37.40 --> 00:52:42.32
back and think because that maneuver, that movement requires no brain power.

607
00:52:42.32 --> 00:52:44.40
You just turn your airplane and pull back in the stick.

608
00:52:44.40 --> 00:52:48.88
It's like the first thing you ever learned to do and that's what allows you to look around

609
00:52:48.88 --> 00:52:49.92
and see what's happening.

610
00:52:49.92 --> 00:52:53.28
We would do these training missions and we would record everything.

611
00:52:53.28 --> 00:52:55.84
Cameras over your shoulder cameras in the front of the plane, the crams are everywhere.

612
00:52:55.84 --> 00:52:58.96
And the radar screen is on the right side of almost every jet I flew it's over on the

613
00:52:58.96 --> 00:52:59.96
right side.

614
00:52:59.96 --> 00:53:04.36
You would see guys heads to the point that there are no just almost on the screen and they

615
00:53:04.36 --> 00:53:08.20
were staring at the one thing that thought was the most important thing and literally

616
00:53:08.20 --> 00:53:12.08
not looking or, so it's no different than being on the line.

617
00:53:12.08 --> 00:53:13.08
It's target fixation.

618
00:53:13.08 --> 00:53:14.08
It's target fixation.

619
00:53:14.08 --> 00:53:22.32
It's looking down the side of your weapon and if you took, just take, take a step back

620
00:53:22.32 --> 00:53:25.08
and airplane so you could just lift your head, just lift your head up and look around.

621
00:53:25.08 --> 00:53:28.28
What would you, so it's that what you would tell the young pilots.

622
00:53:28.28 --> 00:53:29.28
Literally those words.

623
00:53:29.28 --> 00:53:32.44
Yeah, I'd say, do you see your head in the reflection, do you see your helmet?

624
00:53:32.44 --> 00:53:33.44
Where is it?

625
00:53:33.44 --> 00:53:36.36
Because it's literally touching the radar and all the pilots that you're listening to are

626
00:53:36.36 --> 00:53:39.64
not laughing because they know what that looks like where your nose is on the screen

627
00:53:39.64 --> 00:53:42.84
because you're staring at it and you don't see anything else that's going on.

628
00:53:42.84 --> 00:53:46.92
That immediate action drill is a move that requires no real brain.

629
00:53:46.92 --> 00:53:50.36
It doesn't require you to do anything other than the maneuver and during that time is

630
00:53:50.36 --> 00:53:54.04
when you take a step back, you look around the big picture and then you make a decision.

631
00:53:54.04 --> 00:54:00.60
I mean, this is what I actually wrote on Seth Stone's Humvee window in front of his

632
00:54:00.60 --> 00:54:01.60
face.

633
00:54:01.60 --> 00:54:02.60
Yeah, with grease pencil.

634
00:54:02.60 --> 00:54:04.60
I wrote a step number one.

635
00:54:04.60 --> 00:54:06.48
I said, listen man, that's what you're going to do.

636
00:54:06.48 --> 00:54:08.80
Step number one, relax.

637
00:54:08.80 --> 00:54:11.60
Step number two, look around.

638
00:54:11.60 --> 00:54:14.04
Step number three, make a call.

639
00:54:14.04 --> 00:54:20.48
As soon as he, the next run, he'd follow those instructions and that's exact and it was like

640
00:54:20.48 --> 00:54:23.44
a total game changer for, for, oh.

641
00:54:23.44 --> 00:54:28.96
Instead of just staring at like the targets that just popped up down range or the where your

642
00:54:28.96 --> 00:54:35.52
guys rounds were impacting like, no, just take us, just relax, look around and make

643
00:54:35.52 --> 00:54:36.52
a call.

644
00:54:36.52 --> 00:54:41.60
So when you had a really good pilot with their head just be constantly just all looking

645
00:54:41.60 --> 00:54:42.60
all around.

646
00:54:42.60 --> 00:54:43.60
Full of time.

647
00:54:43.60 --> 00:54:44.60
Yeah, all the time.

648
00:54:44.60 --> 00:54:45.60
They never stop moving.

649
00:54:45.60 --> 00:54:48.76
They never stop looking around and they talk very little.

650
00:54:48.76 --> 00:54:50.12
They don't say very much.

651
00:54:50.12 --> 00:54:55.36
They're just, and, and at some interval, they make one call.

652
00:54:55.36 --> 00:54:57.24
Sweet one, two, full north.

653
00:54:57.24 --> 00:55:00.76
And all of a sudden there's a whole formation which, and because they would see whatever's

654
00:55:00.76 --> 00:55:05.32
happening and he can make these massive amount of influences into what's going on in fight

655
00:55:05.32 --> 00:55:09.12
by talking less than everybody else because he's spending 90% of the time just watching

656
00:55:09.12 --> 00:55:11.88
and go, there's some friction creating over here.

657
00:55:11.88 --> 00:55:12.88
Nobody's responding to it.

658
00:55:12.88 --> 00:55:14.44
I'm going to get my guy sitting over the way.

659
00:55:14.44 --> 00:55:20.80
He's just attached sitting up at altitude mentally and going, okay, we're going to take

660
00:55:20.80 --> 00:55:24.08
us that back and, oh, this is what we're going to do now.

661
00:55:24.08 --> 00:55:28.98
And that's why as a mission commander, we talk about, you know, dog fighting against another

662
00:55:28.98 --> 00:55:34.48
aircraft and how fun that is and how much you, it's the last thing I really wanted to be

663
00:55:34.48 --> 00:55:36.12
doing as a leader.

664
00:55:36.12 --> 00:55:38.56
That's no different than being in hand-to-hand combat when you're trying to lead your

665
00:55:38.56 --> 00:55:39.56
battalion.

666
00:55:39.56 --> 00:55:42.28
It seems like a lot of fun and don't get me wrong.

667
00:55:42.28 --> 00:55:44.40
If the opportunity, if you had to do it, you do it.

668
00:55:44.40 --> 00:55:46.32
That's required, of course, you do that.

669
00:55:46.32 --> 00:55:51.000
But really, the best leaders in an airplane were the ones that shot the least, said the

670
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.92
least, saw the most and made the right calls and right influence because they were detached

671
00:55:54.92 --> 00:55:55.92
the whole time.

672
00:55:55.92 --> 00:56:03.84
And this is completely reinforced by the fact that the American fighters in Korea, one

673
00:56:03.84 --> 00:56:07.16
of the biggest assets that they had was they had the clear cock.

674
00:56:07.16 --> 00:56:08.16
That's exactly right.

675
00:56:08.16 --> 00:56:09.16
Yep.

676
00:56:09.16 --> 00:56:12.16
Like that made, you know, you think, oh, I'm sure that makes it deal.

677
00:56:12.16 --> 00:56:14.36
No, you don't get what big deal that makes.

678
00:56:14.36 --> 00:56:18.72
They all had perfect vision and they could see more than they had me could see.

679
00:56:18.72 --> 00:56:19.72
That was the difference maker.

680
00:56:19.72 --> 00:56:21.80
It certainly wasn't how good the machine was.

681
00:56:21.80 --> 00:56:23.04
We've talked about this a bunch of times.

682
00:56:23.04 --> 00:56:24.68
The machine wasn't that good at all.

683
00:56:24.68 --> 00:56:27.20
But the big advantage of it is they could see more.

684
00:56:27.20 --> 00:56:28.20
Literally see more.

685
00:56:28.20 --> 00:56:30.92
You could see things sooner, see things better, see things more clearly and make decisions

686
00:56:30.92 --> 00:56:33.44
based on that and how much of a advantage that was.

687
00:56:33.44 --> 00:56:37.04
When you said perfect vision or you talked about the actual 2020 vision of the pilots.

688
00:56:37.04 --> 00:56:39.68
If you talked to those guys back in the world where we were too in Korea, they were guys

689
00:56:39.68 --> 00:56:42.68
fully like the guys with the most kills, they had like 2010.

690
00:56:42.68 --> 00:56:43.68
Yeah.

691
00:56:43.68 --> 00:56:46.28
One of the things they all had was they had incredible eyesight.

692
00:56:46.28 --> 00:56:46.80
Yeah.

693
00:56:46.80 --> 00:56:47.80
Literally vision.

694
00:56:47.80 --> 00:56:48.80
Yeah.

695
00:56:48.80 --> 00:56:49.80
Yeah.

696
00:56:49.80 --> 00:56:50.80
Yeah.

697
00:56:50.80 --> 00:56:51.80
Yeah.

698
00:56:51.80 --> 00:56:52.80
That's right.

699
00:56:52.80 --> 00:56:54.48
Because I in Yagres book Yagres, he talks about how he could see before anyone else could

700
00:56:54.48 --> 00:56:58.52
see he go, oh, we got bogies of whatever three o'clock and it would be the game change.

701
00:56:58.52 --> 00:56:59.52
Absolutely.

702
00:56:59.52 --> 00:57:00.52
Because now you're making maneuvers.

703
00:57:00.52 --> 00:57:07.20
My oldest daughter has 25 vision.

704
00:57:07.20 --> 00:57:10.88
And like when she goes to get her eyesight checked, they bring other people into the room.

705
00:57:10.88 --> 00:57:12.20
They're like, watch this.

706
00:57:12.20 --> 00:57:13.20
It's awesome.

707
00:57:13.20 --> 00:57:14.20
Yeah.

708
00:57:14.20 --> 00:57:15.20
But I don't know.

709
00:57:15.20 --> 00:57:18.20
I don't think the generations of fighter, but well, it doesn't really matter that much anymore.

710
00:57:18.20 --> 00:57:19.20
Right?

711
00:57:19.20 --> 00:57:20.52
Because you got radar.

712
00:57:20.52 --> 00:57:21.52
It doesn't.

713
00:57:21.52 --> 00:57:23.60
That attribute doesn't matter as much.

714
00:57:23.60 --> 00:57:26.16
The visual acuity doesn't matter as much.

715
00:57:26.16 --> 00:57:27.88
But the principle is exactly the same.

716
00:57:27.88 --> 00:57:29.64
It's just what do you.

717
00:57:29.64 --> 00:57:30.64
What do you see?

718
00:57:30.64 --> 00:57:32.04
And you don't see when you're staring at one thing.

719
00:57:32.04 --> 00:57:33.04
You don't see anything else.

720
00:57:33.04 --> 00:57:34.04
Yeah.

721
00:57:34.04 --> 00:57:36.52
You know what you see when you're staring out your A cog.

722
00:57:36.52 --> 00:57:37.52
Right?

723
00:57:37.52 --> 00:57:38.52
You see nothing.

724
00:57:38.52 --> 00:57:39.52
That's right.

725
00:57:39.52 --> 00:57:40.52
You think you see something.

726
00:57:40.52 --> 00:57:45.68
Absolutely nothing and from a leadership perspective, you're making some big mistakes.

727
00:57:45.68 --> 00:57:46.68
Back to the book.

728
00:57:46.68 --> 00:57:50.52
It fosters a climate where senior leaders know that their intent will be carried out.

729
00:57:50.52 --> 00:57:54.96
This is particularly true for first Italian seventh marine during Operation Desert Storm

730
00:57:54.96 --> 00:57:59.32
as a baton began breaching operations for the advance of the first marine division across

731
00:57:59.32 --> 00:58:00.56
the tooth.

732
00:58:00.56 --> 00:58:04.72
The first who I rackied mine belts, Marines were suddenly overwhelmed with hundreds

733
00:58:04.72 --> 00:58:10.44
upon hundreds of Iraqis supporting white flags.

734
00:58:10.44 --> 00:58:12.24
Who were trying to surrender?

735
00:58:12.24 --> 00:58:15.28
The number was so great that it threatened to stop them marine advance.

736
00:58:15.28 --> 00:58:18.16
However, the Italian commander immediately recognized the situation.

737
00:58:18.16 --> 00:58:22.92
Judges that the Iraqis were harmless and instructed the Italian not to stop to accept

738
00:58:22.92 --> 00:58:24.44
their surrender.

739
00:58:24.44 --> 00:58:29.12
It was precisely the type of local situation that the division commander wanted his commanders

740
00:58:29.12 --> 00:58:33.40
to recognize and use their own initiative to correct.

741
00:58:33.40 --> 00:58:37.16
Here the commanding officer who is closest to the situation and who understood the division

742
00:58:37.16 --> 00:58:42.72
commander's intent, not to lose the momentum of the advance adapted to the situation.

743
00:58:42.72 --> 00:58:46.40
This adaptation resulted in the rapid breach of Iraqi defenses.

744
00:58:46.40 --> 00:58:49.24
I hope that they rewrite this book soon.

745
00:58:49.24 --> 00:58:53.64
That's a cool example, but the examples that they're going to get from Iraq and Afghanistan

746
00:58:53.64 --> 00:58:56.88
are going to be really awesome too.

747
00:58:56.88 --> 00:58:57.88
Conclusion.

748
00:58:57.88 --> 00:59:04.16
Successful warfare is filled with examples of leaders adapting to changing situations.

749
00:59:04.16 --> 00:59:10.40
You must start to learn how to adapt now during our training.

750
00:59:10.40 --> 00:59:14.000
Leaders should value and encourage innovative thinking.

751
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:21.36
Moreover, they should expect creative thinking from their subordinates because it creates

752
00:59:21.36 --> 00:59:24.24
new opportunities.

753
00:59:24.24 --> 00:59:29.24
For adaptation to be effective, commanders must readily exploit the opportunities uncovered

754
00:59:29.24 --> 00:59:31.04
by subordinates.

755
00:59:31.04 --> 00:59:38.28
Leaders cannot remain tied to plans that blind them to fleeting opportunities.

756
00:59:38.28 --> 00:59:44.96
Commanders cannot remain tied to plans that blind them to fleeting opportunities.

757
00:59:44.96 --> 00:59:50.08
While making the best possible preparations, they must welcome and take advantage of

758
00:59:50.08 --> 00:59:53.08
unforeseen opportunities.

759
00:59:53.08 --> 00:59:54.08
Training.

760
00:59:54.08 --> 00:59:55.08
Now during our training.

761
00:59:55.08 --> 01:00:04.88
This was at the last master, I had a revelation because there's a story that you talk about

762
01:00:04.88 --> 01:00:10.64
when you experienced a female, a belligerent female, Iraqi.

763
01:00:10.64 --> 01:00:20.44
And basically, what would you say she was doing to you physically moving on you in a non-leaf

764
01:00:20.44 --> 01:00:26.36
way, but in a way that was disruptive to what you were trying to do?

765
01:00:26.36 --> 01:00:27.36
Absolutely.

766
01:00:27.36 --> 01:00:30.000
You're in a building, you're doing a clearance.

767
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.56
This was really early in your deployment to a Romadi.

768
01:00:32.56 --> 01:00:33.84
It's my first mission.

769
01:00:33.84 --> 01:00:34.84
First mission.

770
01:00:34.84 --> 01:00:35.84
Go ahead and tell us what happened.

771
01:00:35.84 --> 01:00:40.40
As all my first mission, the mission was we were going to clear out an apartment complex

772
01:00:40.40 --> 01:00:41.40
and a main house.

773
01:00:41.40 --> 01:00:42.88
It was probably six or seven rooms.

774
01:00:42.88 --> 01:00:44.92
We didn't just start to hear you ask anything.

775
01:00:44.92 --> 01:00:46.20
To me, got it.

776
01:00:46.20 --> 01:00:47.44
Yeah, good times.

777
01:00:47.44 --> 01:00:51.92
So we cleared out this room, it cleared out all the rooms in the building and we essentially

778
01:00:51.92 --> 01:00:55.88
accomplished our primary objective, which is clear everybody out, separated the men and the women

779
01:00:55.88 --> 01:00:58.80
to figure out if we could find the guy we're looking for.

780
01:00:58.80 --> 01:01:03.60
And they asked me to just go sit in the main courtyard of the main front of this building

781
01:01:03.60 --> 01:01:05.04
and just secure the door.

782
01:01:05.04 --> 01:01:08.68
Are you with an army company or an army platoon?

783
01:01:08.68 --> 01:01:09.68
National Guard platoon.

784
01:01:09.68 --> 01:01:10.68
National Guard platoon.

785
01:01:10.68 --> 01:01:11.68
Yes, before that, Guard unit.

786
01:01:11.68 --> 01:01:13.72
So they're just to set this up a little bit.

787
01:01:13.72 --> 01:01:15.000
So they're the assault force.

788
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.32
They're taking out a building.

789
01:01:16.32 --> 01:01:22.28
And they got good deal day to go, come in with them and run air, support if needed with

790
01:01:22.28 --> 01:01:23.28
your ankle.

791
01:01:23.28 --> 01:01:24.28
That's right.

792
01:01:24.28 --> 01:01:26.20
First mission I went on these guys have been there almost a year.

793
01:01:26.20 --> 01:01:28.16
I went with them to support with air.

794
01:01:28.16 --> 01:01:30.88
Turns out when we got inside this building, there were more rooms and they thought, so

795
01:01:30.88 --> 01:01:32.32
I had to do some room clearances.

796
01:01:32.32 --> 01:01:33.48
So I wasn't expecting it.

797
01:01:33.48 --> 01:01:34.48
We did it.

798
01:01:34.48 --> 01:01:35.48
It was fine.

799
01:01:35.48 --> 01:01:39.36
Then I finished that up and I'm just sitting in the front open area of this building.

800
01:01:39.36 --> 01:01:41.000
Thinking, everybody is accounted for.

801
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.28
Everybody secure down the stairs, probably 20 feet in front of me.

802
01:01:44.28 --> 01:01:46.88
And old Iraqi woman, she's probably in her 70s, maybe older.

803
01:01:46.88 --> 01:01:48.44
She's less than five feet tall.

804
01:01:48.44 --> 01:01:49.60
She's a tiny little thing.

805
01:01:49.60 --> 01:01:52.60
And she is screaming, pointing her finger, yelling me.

806
01:01:52.60 --> 01:01:55.80
And I'm alone in this room because we think this room is secure.

807
01:01:55.80 --> 01:01:57.84
It's close to the outside so I can talk to air.

808
01:01:57.84 --> 01:02:01.24
And she starts coming out me and she's pointing her finger, screaming me in Arabic.

809
01:02:01.24 --> 01:02:05.84
And she's not with her hands, but her body, she's so aggressive.

810
01:02:05.84 --> 01:02:07.16
And she's I'm backing up.

811
01:02:07.16 --> 01:02:08.96
She's moving me backwards.

812
01:02:08.96 --> 01:02:10.32
And I literally don't know what to do.

813
01:02:10.32 --> 01:02:13.32
So I just start backing up, up against the wall.

814
01:02:13.32 --> 01:02:14.96
And then how did it conclude?

815
01:02:14.96 --> 01:02:18.84
It concluded she got to about, I don't know, maybe six or seven feet for me.

816
01:02:18.84 --> 01:02:22.92
And over my right shoulder was the entrance to the outside and the platoon commander in

817
01:02:22.92 --> 01:02:24.80
charge of this whole thing, walked in.

818
01:02:24.80 --> 01:02:30.04
He either heard it or was just coming back into sea was going on and he heard it and he came in.

819
01:02:30.04 --> 01:02:34.28
And he literally just raises weapons, screamed her to stop and disrupted the situation.

820
01:02:34.28 --> 01:02:36.08
He was pretty aggressive and got her to stop.

821
01:02:36.08 --> 01:02:37.08
And she stopped.

822
01:02:37.08 --> 01:02:38.08
That was it.

823
01:02:38.08 --> 01:02:39.68
I was literally doing nothing.

824
01:02:39.68 --> 01:02:43.08
And I was, when you talk about, you described this really this,

825
01:02:43.08 --> 01:02:46.28
my little mental repertoire of all the things I had all the resources available to me.

826
01:02:46.28 --> 01:02:47.12
I was out of ideas.

827
01:02:47.12 --> 01:02:48.12
I didn't know what to do.

828
01:02:48.12 --> 01:02:48.12
Yeah.

829
01:02:48.12 --> 01:02:49.12
No weapon.

830
01:02:49.12 --> 01:02:50.28
I did not know what to do.

831
01:02:50.28 --> 01:02:51.12
So guess what?

832
01:02:51.12 --> 01:02:52.12
I didn't do anything.

833
01:02:52.12 --> 01:02:53.12
Yeah.

834
01:02:53.12 --> 01:02:59.08
So just again, because this might seem real obvious, when you've got a civilian woman coming

835
01:02:59.08 --> 01:03:01.60
at you, you can't, you're not going to shoot her.

836
01:03:01.60 --> 01:03:03.04
You don't want to hit her.

837
01:03:03.04 --> 01:03:04.68
Like she's 70 years old.

838
01:03:04.68 --> 01:03:06.04
And so what are you going to do?

839
01:03:06.04 --> 01:03:07.08
How are you going to handle the situation?

840
01:03:07.08 --> 01:03:08.48
It's a situation you'd never been in.

841
01:03:08.48 --> 01:03:13.000
So the connection that I made at the last monster, because I was listening to you tell that story.

842
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:13.84
And what?

843
01:03:13.84 --> 01:03:17.72
And I tell a story about what I would set run training.

844
01:03:17.72 --> 01:03:25.68
We hired middle-aged Arabic women to come and be role players and yell at people and be abrasive

845
01:03:25.68 --> 01:03:27.08
and be aggressive.

846
01:03:27.08 --> 01:03:29.000
And so why did I do that?

847
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.36
Because I wanted the guys to be ready, because I knew that that's what's going to happen

848
01:03:31.36 --> 01:03:32.68
overseas.

849
01:03:32.68 --> 01:03:34.48
And so it's one of those things.

850
01:03:34.48 --> 01:03:39.52
And if you've never seen it before, get don't know what to do.

851
01:03:39.52 --> 01:03:40.80
Or you may not know.

852
01:03:40.80 --> 01:03:41.96
You may not know what to do.

853
01:03:41.96 --> 01:03:44.24
Whereas all you need to see is a one-time one-time.

854
01:03:44.24 --> 01:03:46.68
Like I guarantee you never, I mean you never had that problem again.

855
01:03:46.68 --> 01:03:49.48
You'd realize, oh, this will make her respond.

856
01:03:49.48 --> 01:03:50.84
And the solution wasn't that hard.

857
01:03:50.84 --> 01:03:53.04
But what you described, I immediately went through my head.

858
01:03:53.04 --> 01:03:54.04
Am I going to shoot her?

859
01:03:54.04 --> 01:03:55.04
No.

860
01:03:55.04 --> 01:03:56.04
Am I going to hit her?

861
01:03:56.04 --> 01:03:57.04
No.

862
01:03:57.04 --> 01:04:00.64
I went through those two potential answers in about a half a second.

863
01:04:00.64 --> 01:04:01.64
Answer was no to both.

864
01:04:01.64 --> 01:04:03.28
There was no third step in my mind.

865
01:04:03.28 --> 01:04:04.76
I did not know what else to do.

866
01:04:04.76 --> 01:04:05.76
It literally could have been something.

867
01:04:05.76 --> 01:04:07.64
If I knew the right word, put my hand up.

868
01:04:07.64 --> 01:04:09.84
And took a step towards her, she would have stopped.

869
01:04:09.84 --> 01:04:13.20
But I didn't know what to do, so I didn't do anything.

870
01:04:13.20 --> 01:04:18.52
So that is why the training that you run as a leader, you got to think about these little

871
01:04:18.52 --> 01:04:19.52
things.

872
01:04:19.52 --> 01:04:20.52
And you might not.

873
01:04:20.52 --> 01:04:25.08
There's plenty of people prior to us deploying to Iraq in 2003.

874
01:04:25.08 --> 01:04:28.52
There's plenty of trainers that would have said, oh, you guys will know what to do.

875
01:04:28.52 --> 01:04:32.84
No, actually they may think they know what to do.

876
01:04:32.84 --> 01:04:35.16
And they might think the wrong thing as well.

877
01:04:35.16 --> 01:04:39.60
The wrong thing could be, oh, if you, because you can hear people say this.

878
01:04:39.60 --> 01:04:42.84
Hey, if they're closing with you, that's a threat you can engage.

879
01:04:42.84 --> 01:04:45.36
It's like no, that's actually completely wrong.

880
01:04:45.36 --> 01:04:46.48
It's actually completely wrong.

881
01:04:46.48 --> 01:04:48.56
You need to think about what's going on.

882
01:04:48.56 --> 01:04:55.08
So the training that you do and putting people into situations that they don't expect.

883
01:04:55.08 --> 01:04:57.04
And I mean, here's the deal, man.

884
01:04:57.04 --> 01:05:05.64
When was the last time you were on the ground clearing buildings as a rifleman?

885
01:05:05.64 --> 01:05:06.64
Never.

886
01:05:06.64 --> 01:05:12.52
I did a, I've been an urban training at the base of school in 1994 for three days.

887
01:05:12.52 --> 01:05:16.12
So now this is nine years later, or eight years later, 12 years later.

888
01:05:16.12 --> 01:05:18.12
Oh, no, 12 years later.

889
01:05:18.12 --> 01:05:19.12
Yeah.

890
01:05:19.12 --> 01:05:22.56
12 years later, and you're clearing rooms like TJ Hooker on my first mission.

891
01:05:22.56 --> 01:05:23.56
Yeah.

892
01:05:23.56 --> 01:05:24.56
Clear rooms.

893
01:05:24.56 --> 01:05:25.56
Yeah.

894
01:05:25.56 --> 01:05:29.20
And that's what we got a train for.

895
01:05:29.20 --> 01:05:30.20
Yeah.

896
01:05:30.20 --> 01:05:31.32
So you got to do that in the business world, too.

897
01:05:31.32 --> 01:05:36.60
You got to look and say, what can you, and here's the point that I wanted to make is,

898
01:05:36.60 --> 01:05:42.48
you might not know the train somebody for in this specific case, an Arabic woman that's

899
01:05:42.48 --> 01:05:43.48
going to come out to you.

900
01:05:43.48 --> 01:05:47.20
I knew that that's what we're going to deal with, especially once I came back from from

901
01:05:47.20 --> 01:05:48.48
Ramadi and Baghdad.

902
01:05:48.48 --> 01:05:51.16
Like I knew that that's what guys are going to be dealing with.

903
01:05:51.16 --> 01:05:55.04
But what situations can you put them in that just make them think?

904
01:05:55.04 --> 01:05:56.04
Just make them think.

905
01:05:56.04 --> 01:05:57.04
Just make them think.

906
01:05:57.04 --> 01:05:58.04
That's what you want to do.

907
01:05:58.04 --> 01:06:02.88
The truth is, what I didn't need was training to deal with Iraqi civilians coming

908
01:06:02.88 --> 01:06:03.88
out.

909
01:06:03.88 --> 01:06:08.08
I needed what I needed to do was recognize that the chaotic environments that I'd been

910
01:06:08.08 --> 01:06:10.60
in the past, the lessons applied there, too.

911
01:06:10.60 --> 01:06:14.72
I needed to spend time thinking about what was this different environment going to look

912
01:06:14.72 --> 01:06:17.96
like and what did I already knew and understood could I leverage?

913
01:06:17.96 --> 01:06:19.44
And that's what I failed to do.

914
01:06:19.44 --> 01:06:25.40
Had I seen Middle-Age Arabic women in training or not, that's not what I look back and

915
01:06:25.40 --> 01:06:28.52
say, that's what I regret for me was not recognizing.

916
01:06:28.52 --> 01:06:31.32
I'm going to be out of my comfort zone very early on.

917
01:06:31.32 --> 01:06:34.84
I've been out of my comfort zone before, I have to remember what that feels like and

918
01:06:34.84 --> 01:06:39.12
apply those same lessons and I could handle that situation a million different ways.

919
01:06:39.12 --> 01:06:42.68
Not because I hadn't seen the exact same thing before, but because I didn't think about

920
01:06:42.68 --> 01:06:46.16
what it's going to feel like to be out of my comfort zone because to be quite honest with

921
01:06:46.16 --> 01:06:47.16
you, Joko.

922
01:06:47.16 --> 01:06:50.64
It'd been a while since I was out of my comfort zone in an airplane and I got pretty

923
01:06:50.64 --> 01:06:54.92
complacent with it and I didn't think about what that was going to be like the very

924
01:06:54.92 --> 01:06:57.20
next time I was turning a rifle clearance.

925
01:06:57.20 --> 01:06:58.20
I just didn't think about it.

926
01:06:58.20 --> 01:07:02.08
And thank God it worked out on that first mission because I cared that with me the

927
01:07:02.08 --> 01:07:04.08
rest of the deployment because it believed me.

928
01:07:04.08 --> 01:07:08.32
I was in a lot more uncomfortable situations for the next seven months, but I never found

929
01:07:08.32 --> 01:07:13.12
myself without understanding what to do moving forward ever because of that experience.

930
01:07:13.12 --> 01:07:18.08
I looked out on that one, but like you said, it applies everywhere.

931
01:07:18.08 --> 01:07:19.96
That lesson fits everywhere in my life.

932
01:07:19.96 --> 01:07:20.96
In anybody's life.

933
01:07:20.96 --> 01:07:21.96
Yeah.

934
01:07:21.96 --> 01:07:32.76
All right, next chapter, next chapter is called cooperating.

935
01:07:32.76 --> 01:07:37.40
Again, it's important to note that what we are saying is that the United States Marine

936
01:07:37.40 --> 01:07:46.28
Corps, one of if not the finest whole fighting force that has ever been on the planet,

937
01:07:46.28 --> 01:07:49.16
has an entire chapter about tactics.

938
01:07:49.16 --> 01:07:55.96
And their book about tactics, there is an entire chapter that's called cooperating.

939
01:07:55.96 --> 01:08:02.96
And this is, you know, I talk about cooperating all the time.

940
01:08:02.96 --> 01:08:04.40
That is one of my laws of combat.

941
01:08:04.40 --> 01:08:06.56
I don't call it cooperating.

942
01:08:06.56 --> 01:08:08.20
I call it cover move.

943
01:08:08.20 --> 01:08:09.20
But that's what it is.

944
01:08:09.20 --> 01:08:10.20
We are going to work together.

945
01:08:10.20 --> 01:08:11.84
That's what cover move is.

946
01:08:11.84 --> 01:08:14.04
We are working together.

947
01:08:14.04 --> 01:08:18.36
So the importance of working together, the Marine Corps identifies it.

948
01:08:18.36 --> 01:08:19.68
They call it something different.

949
01:08:19.68 --> 01:08:20.68
But here we go.

950
01:08:20.68 --> 01:08:24.12
Here's a quote, you leave command.

951
01:08:24.12 --> 01:08:26.60
Is coordinated action toward a common goal.

952
01:08:26.60 --> 01:08:27.88
It is cooperation.

953
01:08:27.88 --> 01:08:33.000
It is working together by all commanders toward the accomplishment of a common mission, which

954
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.24
is imperative for complete and final success.

955
01:08:37.24 --> 01:08:42.80
Commanders must develop their staffs and subordinates that desire to cooperate.

956
01:08:42.80 --> 01:08:46.48
Not only among themselves, but with other elements of the command.

957
01:08:46.48 --> 01:08:49.92
And that's almost an exact quote from when we talk about cover move.

958
01:08:49.92 --> 01:08:52.72
It's not just amongst your own team, but it's with every team that you're working with.

959
01:08:52.72 --> 01:08:58.36
That you need to support or be supported by in order to accomplish your mission.

960
01:08:58.36 --> 01:09:04.56
And that's from tactical principles, an unavvy manual.

961
01:09:04.56 --> 01:09:10.80
The other quote, gear is the first element of command and control is people.

962
01:09:10.80 --> 01:09:15.60
People who gather information, make decisions, take action, communicate and cooperate with

963
01:09:15.60 --> 01:09:19.08
one another in the accomplishment of a common goal.

964
01:09:19.08 --> 01:09:23.08
And that's from another Marine Corps pub called command and control.

965
01:09:23.08 --> 01:09:28.80
And there's people that talk about command or control and we're going to get into it just

966
01:09:28.80 --> 01:09:30.16
so everyone knows it's okay.

967
01:09:30.16 --> 01:09:37.12
You don't need to jump through the air waves and come at us because I get that there's

968
01:09:37.12 --> 01:09:38.12
command or control.

969
01:09:38.12 --> 01:09:39.28
There's command and control.

970
01:09:39.28 --> 01:09:40.40
People talk about it.

971
01:09:40.40 --> 01:09:44.28
So cover move, talking about cooperation.

972
01:09:44.28 --> 01:09:48.32
Something that we do, everything that we have to do in tactics, gaining advantage and above

973
01:09:48.32 --> 01:09:55.64
all achieving a decisive result needs a team effort.

974
01:09:55.64 --> 01:10:00.80
And this is why when I wrote down the laws of combat for the first time, cover move is

975
01:10:00.80 --> 01:10:04.72
first because if you don't have a team, if you don't have cooperation, nothing else

976
01:10:04.72 --> 01:10:05.72
doesn't matter.

977
01:10:05.72 --> 01:10:08.20
Doesn't matter if you have a simple plan, doesn't matter if you prioritize an execute,

978
01:10:08.20 --> 01:10:10.60
doesn't matter if you have decentralized command.

979
01:10:10.60 --> 01:10:14.52
If you don't have a teamwork or can together, it's not going to matter.

980
01:10:14.52 --> 01:10:17.96
If efforts are not in harmony, results may be indecisive.

981
01:10:17.96 --> 01:10:23.24
For example, if the aviation combat elements, actions are not harmonized with those of ground

982
01:10:23.24 --> 01:10:27.20
combat element they are likely, they are unlikely to have a decisive effect.

983
01:10:27.20 --> 01:10:31.36
If artillery support is not well coordinated with an infantry attack, combined arms,

984
01:10:31.36 --> 01:10:34.44
synergy will not be achieved and the attack may fail.

985
01:10:34.44 --> 01:10:38.000
However, achieving this team effort is easier said than done.

986
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.44
It requires rapidly maneuvering forces often widely dispersed to work together under the

987
01:10:44.44 --> 01:10:48.60
most adverse conditions.

988
01:10:48.60 --> 01:10:56.04
Control in combat because war is characterized by chaos, uncertainty and rapid change, control

989
01:10:56.04 --> 01:10:59.92
quickly breaks down.

990
01:10:59.92 --> 01:11:04.36
It is probably a mistake to speak of control in combat.

991
01:11:04.36 --> 01:11:07.44
Think about that right there.

992
01:11:07.44 --> 01:11:13.56
What the Marine Corps is saying is if you are talking about control in combat, you are

993
01:11:13.56 --> 01:11:14.56
probably wrong.

994
01:11:14.56 --> 01:11:16.68
It says it is probably a mistake.

995
01:11:16.68 --> 01:11:20.68
Unless you are saying control is almost impossible, you shouldn't be talking about control

996
01:11:20.68 --> 01:11:21.68
in combat.

997
01:11:21.68 --> 01:11:29.76
I remember the first time I felt the loss of control.

998
01:11:29.76 --> 01:11:30.76
This is pretty early.

999
01:11:30.76 --> 01:11:33.56
You go on a raid and you guys breach the door and they are going in.

1000
01:11:33.56 --> 01:11:35.36
I don't have control that anymore.

1001
01:11:35.36 --> 01:11:39.16
If they are going, whatever they are in there, I can't stop them anymore.

1002
01:11:39.16 --> 01:11:45.36
I mean I come on the radio and call in the board and some of the guys will hear it.

1003
01:11:45.36 --> 01:11:46.48
I can make a verb.

1004
01:11:46.48 --> 01:11:48.48
But they are going.

1005
01:11:48.48 --> 01:11:52.12
It is to try and control it is like a stretch.

1006
01:11:52.12 --> 01:11:56.96
It is a reach.

1007
01:11:56.96 --> 01:12:02.84
Marine Corps publication six states that given the nature of war, it is a delusion to think

1008
01:12:02.84 --> 01:12:06.52
that we can be in control with any sort of servitude or precision.

1009
01:12:06.52 --> 01:12:10.08
Look, I am telling you, is it easy?

1010
01:12:10.08 --> 01:12:12.64
If we go here to target and there is no bad guys and they are going to control that thing

1011
01:12:12.64 --> 01:12:17.24
all day long and everyone is perfect and all the guys are doing what I told them to do.

1012
01:12:17.24 --> 01:12:20.08
Big micro manager over here dictating every movement.

1013
01:12:20.08 --> 01:12:22.24
That will work.

1014
01:12:22.24 --> 01:12:23.56
But that is not combat, right?

1015
01:12:23.56 --> 01:12:25.76
It is a mission but it is not combat.

1016
01:12:25.76 --> 01:12:32.68
As anyone who next sense as anyone who has experienced combat will undoubtedly agree, it

1017
01:12:32.68 --> 01:12:35.68
is impossible to control everything.

1018
01:12:35.68 --> 01:12:43.52
Attempts to impose control also can easily undermine the initiative upon which the Marine

1019
01:12:43.52 --> 01:12:46.84
Corps tactics depend.

1020
01:12:46.84 --> 01:12:48.84
Marines can become hesitant.

1021
01:12:48.84 --> 01:12:52.72
They may feel like they must wait for orders before acting.

1022
01:12:52.72 --> 01:12:58.000
We are not likely to move faster or gain leverage over a competent opponent unless Marines

1023
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.04
at every level exercise initiative.

1024
01:13:02.04 --> 01:13:06.92
The dilemma then is this how do we achieve the goal of working together in harmony while exercising

1025
01:13:06.92 --> 01:13:10.20
a more decentralized type of control?

1026
01:13:10.20 --> 01:13:11.96
There is a little bit of a codomy there.

1027
01:13:11.96 --> 01:13:16.16
Working together in harmony but decentralized command at the same time, JP and I were on a call

1028
01:13:16.16 --> 01:13:19.16
with a client yesterday.

1029
01:13:19.16 --> 01:13:25.36
They were talking about how they need their growing rapidly and they have got branches all

1030
01:13:25.36 --> 01:13:31.84
over the place and what they need is those branches to start acting on their own.

1031
01:13:31.84 --> 01:13:38.84
They need to start using decentralized command and JP jumped in and said, hey, what is

1032
01:13:38.84 --> 01:13:40.24
the messaging they are hearing from you?

1033
01:13:40.24 --> 01:13:46.52
He said because when I first got an attached user, this is JP talking, JP first got an

1034
01:13:46.52 --> 01:13:48.24
attached user.

1035
01:13:48.24 --> 01:13:53.20
He was looking around and going, I am waiting for somebody to tell me what to do.

1036
01:13:53.20 --> 01:13:58.44
I was like, hey, bro, you need to just go do what you think you need to do as long

1037
01:13:58.44 --> 01:14:02.48
as it is in line with what we are trying to make happen.

1038
01:14:02.48 --> 01:14:06.72
You can imagine JP 20 or 22 years old.

1039
01:14:06.72 --> 01:14:13.88
I remember the puzzle kind of curious look on this face when I am telling him, just because

1040
01:14:13.88 --> 01:14:19.56
he hadn't really experienced before like, listen, I trust that you are going to make

1041
01:14:19.56 --> 01:14:22.20
the right decision you are going to make things happen.

1042
01:14:22.20 --> 01:14:26.36
When you hear me say, break contact?

1043
01:14:26.36 --> 01:14:28.36
You know what to do?

1044
01:14:28.36 --> 01:14:29.36
Grab your fire team and make it happen.

1045
01:14:29.36 --> 01:14:33.36
When you hear me say, flank, I am not going to tell you where to go, but you know what

1046
01:14:33.36 --> 01:14:37.52
you know what I mean when I say flank, I mean I want you to go on a straight, mergers

1047
01:14:37.52 --> 01:14:39.52
free right now.

1048
01:14:39.52 --> 01:14:41.36
And JP liked that.

1049
01:14:41.36 --> 01:14:45.44
So that attitude has to come.

1050
01:14:45.44 --> 01:14:49.88
You have to, it takes a little bit of getting used to and people generally aren't used

1051
01:14:49.88 --> 01:14:51.08
to it.

1052
01:14:51.08 --> 01:14:55.48
And it takes a certain level of, I don't know what word use.

1053
01:14:55.48 --> 01:15:00.12
It takes a certain level of courage to think, okay, I've never done, I've never just

1054
01:15:00.12 --> 01:15:05.52
had my boss say, yeah, just flank them and gone and flank them.

1055
01:15:05.52 --> 01:15:07.20
Look, there's parameters to flanking.

1056
01:15:07.20 --> 01:15:12.48
If you flank and you move too far, you can get caught off, you can move into the field

1057
01:15:12.48 --> 01:15:15.12
of friendly field of fire, you can, you can cause some real problems.

1058
01:15:15.12 --> 01:15:18.80
But if you know what those parameters are, you have free reign to maneuver within those

1059
01:15:18.80 --> 01:15:19.80
parameters.

1060
01:15:19.80 --> 01:15:23.16
So, so that was a good point coming from JP to this client.

1061
01:15:23.16 --> 01:15:29.08
Like, have you explained to them that, listen, we're here.

1062
01:15:29.08 --> 01:15:32.40
We are the central command of what's going on.

1063
01:15:32.40 --> 01:15:40.64
But we are authorizing you fully to go out and straight up make things happen.

1064
01:15:40.64 --> 01:15:44.68
And that was a mental jump that JP had to make.

1065
01:15:44.68 --> 01:15:50.04
It probably took him 15 minutes to make it because he, what he recognized was I just took

1066
01:15:50.04 --> 01:15:53.36
the shackles off of his body and more important.

1067
01:15:53.36 --> 01:15:58.36
I took the shackles off of his brain to go and just get some.

1068
01:15:58.36 --> 01:16:02.96
And that's something that you, as a leader, have to make sure that you're delivering that

1069
01:16:02.96 --> 01:16:05.96
message to the troops so that they know they can do that.

1070
01:16:05.96 --> 01:16:11.000
And the confidence it takes a leader to be able to do that, that's significant too.

1071
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.96
Because you're natural instinct when you see things going wrong and you see friction

1072
01:16:13.96 --> 01:16:16.28
starting to build, is to start to tell people what to do.

1073
01:16:16.28 --> 01:16:20.44
And this is flat out telling you, in a lot of cases, it's actually the worst thing you can

1074
01:16:20.44 --> 01:16:24.68
possibly do because what we'll create in those people doing the work is hesitation.

1075
01:16:24.68 --> 01:16:29.52
And they'll freeze and they'll look over their shoulder waiting for your guidance.

1076
01:16:29.52 --> 01:16:30.92
And that could be a death sentence.

1077
01:16:30.92 --> 01:16:33.28
That's a death sentence in business as a death sentence in combat.

1078
01:16:33.28 --> 01:16:36.32
And it's actually what we want to do because we think we're helping.

1079
01:16:36.32 --> 01:16:40.44
I want to get in there and help and it actually takes a ton of confidence as a leader.

1080
01:16:40.44 --> 01:16:42.72
And you talked about that feeling of losing control.

1081
01:16:42.72 --> 01:16:46.24
I remember getting to Ramadi and I had this vision of how I was going to be.

1082
01:16:46.24 --> 01:16:47.88
As soon as I got there, I had to break up my teams.

1083
01:16:47.88 --> 01:16:49.52
I couldn't operate as a 13-man team.

1084
01:16:49.52 --> 01:16:50.32
There was too much to do.

1085
01:16:50.32 --> 01:16:56.72
And I remember probably day three, one of my junior lieutenant at a captain got in this

1086
01:16:56.72 --> 01:16:58.36
home to you with his four guys and drove away.

1087
01:16:58.36 --> 01:17:00.28
And I was standing there and I watched the vehicle driving like,

1088
01:17:00.28 --> 01:17:01.60
hi, five, go get some.

1089
01:17:01.60 --> 01:17:07.60
And as soon as he left, and there's a moment, I haven't talked to him until he comes back.

1090
01:17:07.60 --> 01:17:08.60
Yeah.

1091
01:17:08.60 --> 01:17:09.28
Yeah.

1092
01:17:09.28 --> 01:17:11.28
I did that the same exact thing.

1093
01:17:11.28 --> 01:17:13.72
We split up into five different illness.

1094
01:17:13.72 --> 01:17:18.64
And the next thing I know, I'm sending a junior officer, a new guy, junior officer that's

1095
01:17:18.64 --> 01:17:20.000
never been on deployment before.

1096
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.24
Okay, he's got an E6 with him.

1097
01:17:22.24 --> 01:17:23.44
That's got some experience.

1098
01:17:23.44 --> 01:17:25.60
But hey, man, good luck.

1099
01:17:25.60 --> 01:17:26.60
Yeah.

1100
01:17:26.60 --> 01:17:27.60
Go get some.

1101
01:17:27.60 --> 01:17:30.60
And that is definitely something that you have to.

1102
01:17:30.60 --> 01:17:32.36
It's, it's, it's hard.

1103
01:17:32.36 --> 01:17:34.64
It's hard, man.

1104
01:17:34.64 --> 01:17:35.64
It's hard.

1105
01:17:35.64 --> 01:17:36.64
Going back to the book cooperation.

1106
01:17:36.64 --> 01:17:40.04
The beginning of the answer lies in cooperation.

1107
01:17:40.04 --> 01:17:43.40
So the answer that they're talking about is, how do we, how do we achieve the goal of

1108
01:17:43.40 --> 01:17:48.36
working together in harmony while exercising a more decentralized type of control?

1109
01:17:48.36 --> 01:17:50.96
The beginning of the answer lies in cooperation.

1110
01:17:50.96 --> 01:17:55.72
We define cooperation as the union of self-discipline and initiative in a pursuit of

1111
01:17:55.72 --> 01:17:57.40
a common goal.

1112
01:17:57.40 --> 01:18:00.52
Unfortunately, they didn't think of the word dichotomy in the Marine Corps.

1113
01:18:00.52 --> 01:18:02.60
Because that's what they're talking about.

1114
01:18:02.60 --> 01:18:06.88
The union of self-discipline and initiative in pursuit of a common goal.

1115
01:18:06.88 --> 01:18:10.04
Cooperation can be viewed as a component of control.

1116
01:18:10.04 --> 01:18:16.000
Control can easily, can generally be divided into two types, centralized and decentralized.

1117
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.88
Centralized control tends to be one in one direction and works from the top down.

1118
01:18:20.88 --> 01:18:24.64
Someone at a higher level determines what support it's will and will not do.

1119
01:18:24.64 --> 01:18:29.60
Centralized control makes us conform to higher dictates because one person does the thinking

1120
01:18:29.60 --> 01:18:34.44
for the entire organization, the person in control.

1121
01:18:34.44 --> 01:18:38.60
In contrast, decentralized control works from the bottom up.

1122
01:18:38.60 --> 01:18:43.68
Command is exercise, command is the exercise of authority and guidance.

1123
01:18:43.68 --> 01:18:48.44
And control is felt as feedback about the effects of action taken.

1124
01:18:48.44 --> 01:18:52.60
Because thinking is required at all levels.

1125
01:18:52.60 --> 01:18:59.60
Feedback allows the commander to adapt to changing circumstances and to command subsequent action.

1126
01:18:59.60 --> 01:19:02.68
Cooperation is required in decentralized control.

1127
01:19:02.68 --> 01:19:07.84
Subordinates work together laterally and from the bottom up to accomplish tasks that fulfill

1128
01:19:07.84 --> 01:19:09.36
the commander's intent.

1129
01:19:09.36 --> 01:19:17.44
Cooperation means we take the initiative to help those around us accomplish our shared mission.

1130
01:19:17.44 --> 01:19:21.16
So think about what that means.

1131
01:19:21.16 --> 01:19:25.76
It's saying that the command and control, the definition of control in that decentralized

1132
01:19:25.76 --> 01:19:28.60
command is control is, control is bottom up.

1133
01:19:28.60 --> 01:19:31.76
The control comes up to the commander, not from the commander down.

1134
01:19:31.76 --> 01:19:36.40
The command, the mission that can be top down, but the control and how many leaders we work

1135
01:19:36.40 --> 01:19:41.12
with, that is just completely counterintuitive to how things actually should operate is

1136
01:19:41.12 --> 01:19:44.48
the control comes from the bottom, from the point of friction up to the leadership.

1137
01:19:44.48 --> 01:19:47.64
So they can incorporate all that and make big picture changes.

1138
01:19:47.64 --> 01:19:53.60
One, everyone understands what the commander's intent is, what the broad guidance is.

1139
01:19:53.60 --> 01:19:56.60
Then yes, you go.

1140
01:19:56.60 --> 01:19:57.60
You go and make it happen.

1141
01:19:57.60 --> 01:20:00.88
And the control, this is where I thought you were going to say this is where I thought

1142
01:20:00.88 --> 01:20:01.88
you were going to emphasize.

1143
01:20:01.88 --> 01:20:03.92
Because it is an amazing statement.

1144
01:20:03.92 --> 01:20:12.000
The control that we place upon the troops, the control, the what controls them is that

1145
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.28
they're working together.

1146
01:20:13.28 --> 01:20:15.96
That's what controls them is that they're working together.

1147
01:20:15.96 --> 01:20:20.04
So they can't, they, what stops them from going off going off in some other direction is

1148
01:20:20.04 --> 01:20:21.80
that they're working together.

1149
01:20:21.80 --> 01:20:23.60
They're covering and moving for each other.

1150
01:20:23.60 --> 01:20:26.72
If we don't cover and move for each other, if we decide we're not going to cooperate,

1151
01:20:26.72 --> 01:20:27.60
we're not going to cover and move.

1152
01:20:27.60 --> 01:20:32.000
That means Dave is taking his element and going somewhere where I can no longer support you.

1153
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.64
And that can happen.

1154
01:20:33.64 --> 01:20:36.68
So what controls us is that we are working together.

1155
01:20:36.68 --> 01:20:38.80
Our cooperation is what controls us.

1156
01:20:38.80 --> 01:20:44.04
That's incredible.

1157
01:20:44.04 --> 01:20:46.68
Cooperation is essential to marine cortex.

1158
01:20:46.68 --> 01:20:50.88
The flight leader and wing men work on the basis of cooperation.

1159
01:20:50.88 --> 01:20:54.32
These pilots cooperate with the infantry they support.

1160
01:20:54.32 --> 01:20:59.000
It's just so everyone knows you could easily just replace these with cover move.

1161
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.52
The flight leader and the wing men work on the basis of cover move.

1162
01:21:01.52 --> 01:21:04.12
This pilot's cover move with the infantry they support.

1163
01:21:04.12 --> 01:21:08.40
Two infantry units fighting side by side cover move for each other.

1164
01:21:08.40 --> 01:21:15.76
A mobile combat service support detachment and the mechanized force, it supports cover move.

1165
01:21:15.76 --> 01:21:16.92
Cooperation.

1166
01:21:16.92 --> 01:21:22.68
We all work together far more effectively when we communicate laterally than when we communicate

1167
01:21:22.68 --> 01:21:26.72
only through higher headquarters and respond only to centralized direction.

1168
01:21:26.72 --> 01:21:31.48
As an ancillary benefit, we relieve our overloaded communication networks.

1169
01:21:31.48 --> 01:21:37.80
So yeah, talk to your peers, talk to the people next to you.

1170
01:21:37.80 --> 01:21:40.36
Not just hey, I'm going to tell the boss on you.

1171
01:21:40.36 --> 01:21:43.000
Tell him to give you some direction.

1172
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.48
Work out the problems amongst yourselves.

1173
01:21:45.48 --> 01:21:50.24
The history of tactics is filled with examples where cooperation made the difference.

1174
01:21:50.24 --> 01:21:51.48
And control could not.

1175
01:21:51.48 --> 01:21:56.16
One such example occurred during an Iraqi counterattack in Operation Desert Storm.

1176
01:21:56.16 --> 01:22:01.40
Black smoke from a burning from burning oil wells turned the day into night.

1177
01:22:01.40 --> 01:22:06.60
A UH1 Huey pilot used his night vision equipment to lead flights of cobras through the

1178
01:22:06.60 --> 01:22:12.76
near zero visibility to attack Iraqi armored vehicles, especially equipped Huey designated

1179
01:22:12.76 --> 01:22:17.84
targets so that the cobras could engage them at near point blank range with anti-armor

1180
01:22:17.84 --> 01:22:19.08
hellfire missiles.

1181
01:22:19.08 --> 01:22:24.40
For nearly 10 hours, the Huey pilot led flight after flight into the pitched battle, earning

1182
01:22:24.40 --> 01:22:28.16
the Navy Cross for heroism.

1183
01:22:28.16 --> 01:22:33.12
The pilot's works together to destroy targets the Huey could not engage and the cobra

1184
01:22:33.12 --> 01:22:35.84
could not see.

1185
01:22:35.84 --> 01:22:42.000
This example shows what cooperation can accomplish cover move.

1186
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:50.16
The next section, oddly enough, is called discipline.

1187
01:22:50.16 --> 01:22:56.44
Cooperation can harmonize efforts and get everyone to work together without centralized

1188
01:22:56.44 --> 01:22:58.68
control that undermines initiative.

1189
01:22:58.68 --> 01:23:01.64
However, it raises a more fundamental question.

1190
01:23:01.64 --> 01:23:06.48
How do we prepare people to cooperate when the going gets tough?

1191
01:23:06.48 --> 01:23:08.48
The answer is discipline.

1192
01:23:08.48 --> 01:23:12.08
There is only one kind of discipline, perfect discipline.

1193
01:23:12.08 --> 01:23:17.32
If you do not enforce and maintain discipline, you are potential mergers.

1194
01:23:17.32 --> 01:23:23.64
In the face of adversity and difficulty, discipline enables individuals to pursue what is

1195
01:23:23.64 --> 01:23:29.64
best for those around them, their unit and the Marine Corps.

1196
01:23:29.64 --> 01:23:35.04
Notice that no part of that talked about pursuing what is best for the person themselves.

1197
01:23:35.04 --> 01:23:40.28
Discipline enables individuals to pursue what is best for those around them, their unit

1198
01:23:40.28 --> 01:23:42.44
and the Marine Corps.

1199
01:23:42.44 --> 01:23:46.44
Individuals and units might have the desire, but without discipline, they will be unable

1200
01:23:46.44 --> 01:23:50.72
to accomplish the most difficult tasks in combat, operating faster than the enemy gaining

1201
01:23:50.72 --> 01:23:56.24
advantage, generating decisive force and achieving decisive results.

1202
01:23:56.24 --> 01:24:00.44
In combat, instant obedience to orders is crucial.

1203
01:24:00.44 --> 01:24:04.40
Orders may not be popular, but there comes a point where they must be carried out without

1204
01:24:04.40 --> 01:24:05.40
question.

1205
01:24:05.40 --> 01:24:09.80
Discipline is a result of training, in training for war, discipline should be firm, but

1206
01:24:09.80 --> 01:24:11.60
fair.

1207
01:24:11.60 --> 01:24:17.40
The Marine Corps is known as a highly disciplined fighting force, and I got a pause.

1208
01:24:17.40 --> 01:24:24.28
So that instant obedience to orders being crucial, that's something that I always have

1209
01:24:24.28 --> 01:24:32.60
to discuss with companies, with guys in the military, with guys in the teams.

1210
01:24:32.60 --> 01:24:35.48
What does that actually mean?

1211
01:24:35.48 --> 01:24:39.24
And there's a whole, I mean, it's not that complicated.

1212
01:24:39.24 --> 01:24:41.56
Here's the deal.

1213
01:24:41.56 --> 01:24:46.48
When you see something and you're being told to do something, and it makes sense, you

1214
01:24:46.48 --> 01:24:48.76
do it, and you do it quick.

1215
01:24:48.76 --> 01:24:54.04
If there's something that is going with this is a horrible decision that's coming at you,

1216
01:24:54.04 --> 01:24:56.12
you might need to push back on that decision.

1217
01:24:56.12 --> 01:25:01.16
Up the chain of command, yes, I'm saying that, even in the Marine Corps, I'm telling you.

1218
01:25:01.16 --> 01:25:08.24
If you're being told to end rebuilding and you see an IED in the doorway of the building,

1219
01:25:08.24 --> 01:25:13.000
you should not instantly obey this order.

1220
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.44
That's, that's, your boss doesn't want you to do that.

1221
01:25:15.44 --> 01:25:20.36
Your platoon commander, your platoon sergeant does not want you to do that.

1222
01:25:20.36 --> 01:25:28.68
So the instant obedience to orders, it's crucial, but we also need to remember that there

1223
01:25:28.68 --> 01:25:31.56
is an abroad order that you've been told.

1224
01:25:31.56 --> 01:25:33.88
There's a broad commanders intent.

1225
01:25:33.88 --> 01:25:39.48
The commander's intent is not to get your men and killed doing something stupid.

1226
01:25:39.48 --> 01:25:46.44
The overlying order is, hey, we're going to accomplish this, this larger mission.

1227
01:25:46.44 --> 01:25:50.76
And the tactical call that's being made at this point in time, if it doesn't support that

1228
01:25:50.76 --> 01:25:56.76
overall broader mission, then you should not do it.

1229
01:25:56.76 --> 01:26:04.92
Now there's a whole plethora of situations that can unfold.

1230
01:26:04.92 --> 01:26:08.80
So if I'm telling Dave to enter that building and there's an IED in the, and I'm the guy

1231
01:26:08.80 --> 01:26:13.20
in charge, and I'm telling Dave that there's an IED in the front yard, or I'm telling you

1232
01:26:13.20 --> 01:26:15.88
to enter a building and there's an IED in the door, right?

1233
01:26:15.88 --> 01:26:19.88
And you, you tell me, no, that's a bad call, Jocco.

1234
01:26:19.88 --> 01:26:25.08
I'm not now going to say shut up, Dave, and do what I told you to do.

1235
01:26:25.08 --> 01:26:29.92
I'm going to say, no, we need you in that building, and you're going to say, look, no,

1236
01:26:29.92 --> 01:26:30.92
not a good call.

1237
01:26:30.92 --> 01:26:32.52
You might not have time to tell me there's an IED.

1238
01:26:32.52 --> 01:26:34.16
You might just say, no, not a good call.

1239
01:26:34.16 --> 01:26:39.08
Luckily, you and I have built a relationship of trust where you now, when you tell me you can't

1240
01:26:39.08 --> 01:26:43.40
do something that I'm telling you do, I know the only reason possible that you are not

1241
01:26:43.40 --> 01:26:48.32
doing what I told you to do is because it is not possible to do or it's stupid.

1242
01:26:48.32 --> 01:26:52.56
And then I'm going to, this is a weird thing that I have trouble articulating.

1243
01:26:52.56 --> 01:26:57.72
Now I'm actually going to go instead of telling you what to do, I'm going to tell you

1244
01:26:57.72 --> 01:26:59.68
why it was I wanted you to do it.

1245
01:26:59.68 --> 01:27:05.04
Hey, well, what we need is to strong point of building because we're getting attacked.

1246
01:27:05.04 --> 01:27:07.04
And now you look at me, okay, got that.

1247
01:27:07.04 --> 01:27:08.04
I can do that.

1248
01:27:08.04 --> 01:27:11.12
I'm going to strong point this other building over here and you go do it and then you bring

1249
01:27:11.12 --> 01:27:12.16
us there.

1250
01:27:12.16 --> 01:27:17.24
So instant obedience to orders that makes sense is true.

1251
01:27:17.24 --> 01:27:22.32
Remember that there are broad orders that you need to follow out.

1252
01:27:22.32 --> 01:27:27.72
Now there could be times where, and when you start talking about World War II, there

1253
01:27:27.72 --> 01:27:31.96
was times where it's like, hey, you need to charge that machine gun nest.

1254
01:27:31.96 --> 01:27:34.56
And here's what's going to happen.

1255
01:27:34.56 --> 01:27:39.32
You charge that machine gun nest with your squad and you're going to lose half of them.

1256
01:27:39.32 --> 01:27:40.56
Right?

1257
01:27:40.56 --> 01:27:45.76
If you don't do that, this whole company is going to get killed because we're all going

1258
01:27:45.76 --> 01:27:46.76
to sit here.

1259
01:27:46.76 --> 01:27:48.88
So, so guess what happens then?

1260
01:27:48.88 --> 01:27:52.88
When you tell me you're going to go and I say, hey, man, that's an elevated bunker position.

1261
01:27:52.88 --> 01:27:57.36
And you look at me and go, listen, that's the only way we get off this beach.

1262
01:27:57.36 --> 01:27:59.28
Then guess what I do?

1263
01:27:59.28 --> 01:28:02.76
Instant obedience to orders and we're going to go get it done.

1264
01:28:02.76 --> 01:28:07.12
So this isn't black and white.

1265
01:28:07.12 --> 01:28:11.32
You have to think and these are important.

1266
01:28:11.32 --> 01:28:14.20
There's also a thread here.

1267
01:28:14.20 --> 01:28:16.16
There's so many things to talk about.

1268
01:28:16.16 --> 01:28:21.24
You could talk about this for days, but that idea of perfect discipline that immediate

1269
01:28:21.24 --> 01:28:27.52
response to my orders, it's built on a depth and a level of trust that's so powerful

1270
01:28:27.52 --> 01:28:32.12
that the obedience isn't at a fear of not responding to you.

1271
01:28:32.12 --> 01:28:33.40
Tell me what to do.

1272
01:28:33.40 --> 01:28:36.88
The obedience is the recognition that what he's asking me to do is actually what's in the

1273
01:28:36.88 --> 01:28:39.60
best interest of whatever it is.

1274
01:28:39.60 --> 01:28:42.20
This entire team that we're talking about.

1275
01:28:42.20 --> 01:28:48.52
The examples and if you go deep and deep, the stories of guys charging machine guns

1276
01:28:48.52 --> 01:28:52.68
nests weren't waiting for the commander to come down and say, charge the machine gun

1277
01:28:52.68 --> 01:28:56.04
nests, you're actually, if you have that level of trust, you are so front and front,

1278
01:28:56.04 --> 01:29:01.20
I don't need job to tell me that because I actually know you may, I know you may come

1279
01:29:01.20 --> 01:29:04.12
down to tell, but I know that's going to happen before you come down and tell me

1280
01:29:04.12 --> 01:29:06.92
to men get online.

1281
01:29:06.92 --> 01:29:09.16
We are going to charge this machine gun nest.

1282
01:29:09.16 --> 01:29:13.52
And they're talking about this immediate response to orders.

1283
01:29:13.52 --> 01:29:18.40
Don't think of it as you do what I say or this is the consequence is going to happen

1284
01:29:18.40 --> 01:29:19.40
to you.

1285
01:29:19.40 --> 01:29:23.68
It's that recognition that what I'm asking you to do immediately right now is what is

1286
01:29:23.68 --> 01:29:27.56
the best interest of everybody to include you, although I might as a commander you might

1287
01:29:27.56 --> 01:29:30.68
have to make that decision of, I'm going to, there's going to be loss here.

1288
01:29:30.68 --> 01:29:34.68
I'm going to lose some of my men to do that and that burden of doing that, think about

1289
01:29:34.68 --> 01:29:39.24
how much trust is required from the leadership side to cultivate a response from my

1290
01:29:39.24 --> 01:29:42.72
subordinates who know their men are going to die.

1291
01:29:42.72 --> 01:29:50.000
And perfect discipline is that description of, there's no other way for us to be successful

1292
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.32
unless we do this.

1293
01:29:51.32 --> 01:29:55.56
And if I actually push back and say no, what I really would like to be able to do is say, no,

1294
01:29:55.56 --> 01:29:58.12
I'm doing this instead, which is going to accomplish what you ask.

1295
01:29:58.12 --> 01:30:01.72
So I don't have to take the time to talk to you about it in real time that that comment

1296
01:30:01.72 --> 01:30:07.28
of people think Marine Corps, people follow orders of the, the self discipline that's

1297
01:30:07.28 --> 01:30:11.000
imposed on those Marines at that age.

1298
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.64
Only works with trust up and down the, the chain of command that is so much more powerful

1299
01:30:16.64 --> 01:30:19.76
than, than the words can really describe an important that is.

1300
01:30:19.76 --> 01:30:20.76
Yeah.

1301
01:30:20.76 --> 01:30:28.64
Back to the book, the Marine Corps is known as a highly disciplined fighting force.

1302
01:30:28.64 --> 01:30:31.84
The discipline is one of the strengths that makes Marines equally effective assaulting

1303
01:30:31.84 --> 01:30:38.36
a beach, conducting, conducting a non-combat and evacuation operation, fighting a fire or

1304
01:30:38.36 --> 01:30:44.28
guarding our embassies, nonetheless discipline is founded not only on obedience, but also

1305
01:30:44.28 --> 01:30:46.96
on a sense of duty.

1306
01:30:46.96 --> 01:30:52.000
The discipline needed for cooperation comes from two sources, impose discipline and self

1307
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.64
discipline.

1308
01:30:53.64 --> 01:30:59.12
The first source imposed discipline is more often associated with the term military discipline,

1309
01:30:59.12 --> 01:31:04.84
imposed discipline typified by the prussianist approach is characterized by instant obedience

1310
01:31:04.84 --> 01:31:06.36
to orders.

1311
01:31:06.36 --> 01:31:10.68
External and nature it ensures compliance with established procedures, rules and guidance

1312
01:31:10.68 --> 01:31:12.32
and direction from above.

1313
01:31:12.32 --> 01:31:16.80
It means to achieve efficiency and accomplishment of routine, duties or drills.

1314
01:31:16.80 --> 01:31:22.80
In its most extreme form, it can be rigid, paralyzing and destructive of initiative.

1315
01:31:22.80 --> 01:31:27.84
Opposed discipline also may make units vulnerable to the effects of chaos and uncertainty

1316
01:31:27.84 --> 01:31:31.88
and unable to cooperate with one another.

1317
01:31:31.88 --> 01:31:37.52
So that idea that we just talked about that we were trying to dispel that you and I both

1318
01:31:37.52 --> 01:31:42.28
just tried to dispel, well they're in the process now of dispelting it in the book.

1319
01:31:42.28 --> 01:31:49.56
By saying that this idea of imposed discipline is not the kind that we're talking about.

1320
01:31:49.56 --> 01:31:55.04
In post-discipline, we'll prevent the things you have to do, which is be creative,

1321
01:31:55.04 --> 01:31:58.56
it's the thing that undermines what they just said you have to do, is as opposed to

1322
01:31:58.56 --> 01:31:59.56
discipline.

1323
01:31:59.56 --> 01:32:05.48
I had to break this out for young mark in way the warrior kid explained the difference

1324
01:32:05.48 --> 01:32:10.40
between imposed discipline and self-discipline.

1325
01:32:10.40 --> 01:32:17.64
Carrying on self-discipline is an internal force that morally obligates all Marines to do

1326
01:32:17.64 --> 01:32:21.08
what they know is right.

1327
01:32:21.08 --> 01:32:27.84
In this case to cooperate with every other Marine in pursuit of a common goal, the obligation

1328
01:32:27.84 --> 01:32:31.40
is internal in each individual.

1329
01:32:31.40 --> 01:32:35.24
It is something he or she feels powerfully about.

1330
01:32:35.24 --> 01:32:40.52
Coupled with a sense of camaraderie and a spree decor, it pulls from within and causes

1331
01:32:40.52 --> 01:32:44.08
Marines to do everything they can for fellow Marines.

1332
01:32:44.08 --> 01:32:48.40
At the unit level, this force can be felt as morale.

1333
01:32:48.40 --> 01:32:57.64
No system of tactics can lead to victory when the morale of an army is bad.

1334
01:32:57.64 --> 01:33:02.52
Self-discipline can be seen in successful athletic teams as well as military units.

1335
01:33:02.52 --> 01:33:05.44
Team players instinctively back up their teammates.

1336
01:33:05.44 --> 01:33:08.16
In baseball, the outfielder's cover on flyballs.

1337
01:33:08.16 --> 01:33:12.84
In hockey rarely does only one player rush the goal and football offensive line men do not

1338
01:33:12.84 --> 01:33:18.000
stand by idly on a pass play if no defensive player faces them.

1339
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.08
They may block the first defender they can find.

1340
01:33:22.08 --> 01:33:24.28
They block the first defender they can find.

1341
01:33:24.28 --> 01:33:28.36
Members of squad's and fire teams also work together as teams to accomplish tasks and take

1342
01:33:28.36 --> 01:33:29.48
care of each other.

1343
01:33:29.48 --> 01:33:33.84
This cooperation among teammates cannot be enforced by a coach or leader.

1344
01:33:33.84 --> 01:33:38.96
It depends upon the self-discipline of the individuals.

1345
01:33:38.96 --> 01:33:45.64
Marine discipline is the self-discipline of a successful team, not just the imposed discipline

1346
01:33:45.64 --> 01:33:48.36
of the army of Frederick the Great.

1347
01:33:48.36 --> 01:33:54.24
From Marines, military discipline means accepting personal responsibility.

1348
01:33:54.24 --> 01:33:59.12
I think I wrote a book called Extreme Leadership.

1349
01:33:59.12 --> 01:34:03.60
Self-discipline will not allow us to shirt responsibility or blame others.

1350
01:34:03.60 --> 01:34:08.44
I think I wrote a book called Extreme Leadership.

1351
01:34:08.44 --> 01:34:15.64
A discipline failure, often a failure to act is a personal failure.

1352
01:34:15.64 --> 01:34:19.40
Our form of discipline is also absolute.

1353
01:34:19.40 --> 01:34:21.72
There is no time off.

1354
01:34:21.72 --> 01:34:26.52
Someone else may be in charge, but that does not absolve us from the responsibility to do

1355
01:34:26.52 --> 01:34:29.76
everything we can to achieve the common goal.

1356
01:34:29.76 --> 01:34:37.68
It does not reduce our responsibility to cooperate with fellow Marines in our unit and beyond.

1357
01:34:37.68 --> 01:34:42.32
This discipline is a mindset, a way of thinking and behaving.

1358
01:34:42.32 --> 01:34:45.84
It runs through everything that we do.

1359
01:34:45.84 --> 01:34:50.52
It is much a part of Garrison life as of combat.

1360
01:34:50.52 --> 01:34:56.04
We also carry this sense of personal responsibility and duty to contribute into our private

1361
01:34:56.04 --> 01:34:57.04
lives.

1362
01:34:57.04 --> 01:35:01.84
We see it whenever off-duty Marines take the initiative to help at the scene of an accident.

1363
01:35:01.84 --> 01:35:09.24
Act as leaders in their communities or in other ways do more than their share.

1364
01:35:09.24 --> 01:35:16.92
They do so because of something inward, not because they are compelled by control.

1365
01:35:16.92 --> 01:35:27.72
That's something is self-discipline and it is not limited to one aspect of life.

1366
01:35:27.72 --> 01:35:37.92
Those two pages, man, are...

1367
01:35:37.92 --> 01:35:43.88
It is so succinct and so straightforward the way they describe what Marine discipline is

1368
01:35:43.88 --> 01:35:46.36
and where to place.

1369
01:35:46.36 --> 01:35:52.20
All the time, everywhere, without exception and you are wholly responsible for the success

1370
01:35:52.20 --> 01:35:56.52
of everybody else around you based on your individual actions and that applies everywhere

1371
01:35:56.52 --> 01:35:57.52
in your life.

1372
01:35:57.52 --> 01:36:01.36
It took me three books to explain that.

1373
01:36:01.36 --> 01:36:06.56
Yeah, just crystal clear.

1374
01:36:06.56 --> 01:36:07.88
Crystal clear.

1375
01:36:07.88 --> 01:36:11.80
It concludes here modern tactics rely on cooperation.

1376
01:36:11.80 --> 01:36:15.44
Cooperation in turn depends on discipline.

1377
01:36:15.44 --> 01:36:20.000
Discipline consists of both imposed discipline and self-discipline as leaders of Marines

1378
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.36
we must create a climate in which self-discipline and high level of initiative can flourish

1379
01:36:24.36 --> 01:36:27.40
within the boundaries of military discipline.

1380
01:36:27.40 --> 01:36:32.40
There's the dichotomy right there.

1381
01:36:32.40 --> 01:36:37.76
Initiative can flourish within the boundaries of military discipline.

1382
01:36:37.76 --> 01:36:40.88
That's what you want.

1383
01:36:40.88 --> 01:36:46.72
I always use the word parameters when I'm talking about decentralized command, like when I give

1384
01:36:46.72 --> 01:36:50.60
you the parameters, you can do whatever you want inside those parameters.

1385
01:36:50.60 --> 01:36:52.20
That's what they're talking about.

1386
01:36:52.20 --> 01:36:56.72
You do whatever you want within the boundaries of military discipline.

1387
01:36:56.72 --> 01:36:58.40
This climate depends on us.

1388
01:36:58.40 --> 01:36:59.40
Words are easy.

1389
01:36:59.40 --> 01:37:03.96
Anyone can give an occasional pep talk on the merits of self-discipline.

1390
01:37:03.96 --> 01:37:11.36
Marines judge actions not words and respond positively by leadership to leadership by

1391
01:37:11.36 --> 01:37:13.08
example.

1392
01:37:13.08 --> 01:37:19.96
If the leader creates a climate where perfect discipline is expected and demonstrated cooperation

1393
01:37:19.96 --> 01:37:24.80
will follow.

1394
01:37:24.80 --> 01:37:30.24
The discipline is always a good note to end on.

1395
01:37:30.24 --> 01:37:36.60
Actions not word, not words create discipline.

1396
01:37:36.60 --> 01:37:40.40
So that was two more chapters.

1397
01:37:40.40 --> 01:37:42.000
What do we do?

1398
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Not bad.

1399
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.32
A little shorter.

1400
01:37:45.32 --> 01:37:46.32
Two more chapters.

1401
01:37:46.32 --> 01:37:54.08
We got two more to go and we'll dig into those on the next podcast.

1402
01:37:54.08 --> 01:38:01.72
One once again, something that we hear a lot about, something that I talk about a lot,

1403
01:38:01.72 --> 01:38:06.04
the discipline equals freedom field manual.

1404
01:38:06.04 --> 01:38:08.52
I'm glad I wrote that when I did.

1405
01:38:08.52 --> 01:38:11.68
Because it would be hard for me to write it right now and not just say, hey, just go read

1406
01:38:11.68 --> 01:38:16.84
this book.

1407
01:38:16.84 --> 01:38:22.48
This discipline is a critical factor and allows us to win on the battlefield and it allows

1408
01:38:22.48 --> 01:38:29.48
us to really win everywhere in health, in business, in fitness, in jujitsu, in life.

1409
01:38:29.48 --> 01:38:33.48
You got to maintain the discipline.

1410
01:38:33.48 --> 01:38:34.48
Yes.

1411
01:38:34.48 --> 01:38:35.48
Echo Charles.

1412
01:38:35.48 --> 01:38:37.48
Yes.

1413
01:38:37.48 --> 01:38:45.60
Speaking of discipline, now that you are back from your highly undisciplined vacation.

1414
01:38:45.60 --> 01:38:47.48
Well, you know why?

1415
01:38:47.48 --> 01:38:48.48
Is that wrong?

1416
01:38:48.48 --> 01:38:49.48
Yes.

1417
01:38:49.48 --> 01:38:50.48
That is wrong.

1418
01:38:50.48 --> 01:38:51.48
Oh, you were highly disciplined.

1419
01:38:51.48 --> 01:38:52.48
No, no, no.

1420
01:38:52.48 --> 01:38:53.48
It was quasi-disciplined.

1421
01:38:53.48 --> 01:38:54.48
Crosse, I guess.

1422
01:38:54.48 --> 01:38:56.12
You know, kind of, you know, and there.

1423
01:38:56.12 --> 01:38:57.12
And you know, that was a thing.

1424
01:38:57.12 --> 01:38:58.32
I don't think that is a thing.

1425
01:38:58.32 --> 01:38:59.32
I think that.

1426
01:38:59.32 --> 01:39:00.32
It might work.

1427
01:39:00.32 --> 01:39:01.32
That is not a thing.

1428
01:39:01.32 --> 01:39:03.32
Actually, technically, I think that's a counter-equivalent.

1429
01:39:03.32 --> 01:39:08.28
How does the audience, Dave, is there any sections on quasi-disciplined only or one kind

1430
01:39:08.28 --> 01:39:09.28
of discipline?

1431
01:39:09.28 --> 01:39:10.28
It is not quasi-disciplined.

1432
01:39:10.28 --> 01:39:11.28
It is not quasi-disciplined.

1433
01:39:11.28 --> 01:39:14.24
The quasi kind of makes it antiquated.

1434
01:39:14.24 --> 01:39:15.24
Right.

1435
01:39:15.24 --> 01:39:17.12
Because either you discipline or you not discipline, right?

1436
01:39:17.12 --> 01:39:20.32
In fact, quasi-disciplined is essentially undisciplined.

1437
01:39:20.32 --> 01:39:22.52
That is what I, because you see what I'm coming from.

1438
01:39:22.52 --> 01:39:24.80
So your trip to Hawaii was essentially undisciplined.

1439
01:39:24.80 --> 01:39:25.80
It is not quasi-disciplined.

1440
01:39:25.80 --> 01:39:27.52
Yeah, yeah, you're correct.

1441
01:39:27.52 --> 01:39:28.52
All right.

1442
01:39:28.52 --> 01:39:30.76
Now maybe you said that you had some moments of discipline.

1443
01:39:30.76 --> 01:39:31.76
Yeah.

1444
01:39:31.76 --> 01:39:32.76
For sure.

1445
01:39:32.76 --> 01:39:33.76
You made, you did some work.

1446
01:39:33.76 --> 01:39:35.76
Did some work, did some training, did some training.

1447
01:39:35.76 --> 01:39:36.76
You trained some of the judges.

1448
01:39:36.76 --> 01:39:37.76
No.

1449
01:39:37.76 --> 01:39:38.76
Oh.

1450
01:39:38.76 --> 01:39:39.76
That's dangerous.

1451
01:39:39.76 --> 01:39:41.24
But I saw some, you did two guys.

1452
01:39:41.24 --> 01:39:43.36
So, you know, that's something.

1453
01:39:43.36 --> 01:39:44.36
All right.

1454
01:39:44.36 --> 01:39:49.04
Well, since the rest of us are trying to maintain our discipline, do you have any

1455
01:39:49.04 --> 01:39:50.04
recommendations?

1456
01:39:50.04 --> 01:39:51.04
Yeah.

1457
01:39:51.04 --> 01:39:52.04
And I wouldn't be able to do that.

1458
01:39:52.04 --> 01:39:53.04
Yeah.

1459
01:39:53.04 --> 01:39:54.04
We'll talk about the jujitsu.

1460
01:39:54.04 --> 01:39:55.04
That's a good way to maintain discipline.

1461
01:39:55.04 --> 01:39:56.56
So jujitsu is one of those, what do you call?

1462
01:39:56.56 --> 01:40:00.24
You could call it a dichotomy because you have to have discipline to do jujitsu.

1463
01:40:00.24 --> 01:40:04.84
And jujitsu will kind of give you discipline.

1464
01:40:04.84 --> 01:40:06.48
Well, it will prompt.

1465
01:40:06.48 --> 01:40:09.72
I thought you're going to say, if you do jujitsu, you're going to have to have creativity.

1466
01:40:09.72 --> 01:40:10.72
Yes.

1467
01:40:10.72 --> 01:40:11.72
That too.

1468
01:40:11.72 --> 01:40:13.56
You're going to have a full-on metaphor for life.

1469
01:40:13.56 --> 01:40:16.06
In fact, good deal.

1470
01:40:16.06 --> 01:40:20.52
Dave Worker, you're talking about, you know, in the airplane, right, how do you close

1471
01:40:20.52 --> 01:40:21.52
the distance or whatever.

1472
01:40:21.52 --> 01:40:24.44
So, jujitsu is one of those things.

1473
01:40:24.44 --> 01:40:29.68
When you first learn self-defense, jujitsu, especially from the gracy, that gracy way, it's

1474
01:40:29.68 --> 01:40:31.08
like there's three zones.

1475
01:40:31.08 --> 01:40:35.08
The green zone, which is like your out of range, essentially.

1476
01:40:35.08 --> 01:40:38.96
Then there's the other green zone when you're like too close because you can't take

1477
01:40:38.96 --> 01:40:40.84
effective punches, all the same thing.

1478
01:40:40.84 --> 01:40:41.84
Right.

1479
01:40:41.84 --> 01:40:42.68
Then there's that red zone.

1480
01:40:42.68 --> 01:40:45.04
So when you find yourself in your K when you're, what you're talking about, when you

1481
01:40:45.04 --> 01:40:48.76
find yourself in that red zone, kind of, you know, where you got to react, you go to one

1482
01:40:48.76 --> 01:40:49.76
of the green zones.

1483
01:40:49.76 --> 01:40:53.28
And a plane, obviously, to get to the far green zones, going to take way more time, so

1484
01:40:53.28 --> 01:40:54.76
it doesn't seem like the logical thing to do.

1485
01:40:54.76 --> 01:40:55.76
Yeah, you're a huge risk.

1486
01:40:55.76 --> 01:40:56.76
Yes.

1487
01:40:56.76 --> 01:40:57.76
You're trying to get to the far green zone.

1488
01:40:57.76 --> 01:40:58.76
Yeah, it's like unrealistic.

1489
01:40:58.76 --> 01:41:02.96
In fact, you've got to essentially travel through the whole red zone to get to that grid,

1490
01:41:02.96 --> 01:41:03.96
same thing with jujitsu.

1491
01:41:03.96 --> 01:41:08.40
If you're in the red zone, then again, I mean, it's easier to get out of distance than

1492
01:41:08.40 --> 01:41:11.24
it in a fighting situation than it would be in there playing.

1493
01:41:11.24 --> 01:41:12.56
I know, you got it right.

1494
01:41:12.56 --> 01:41:15.64
There's, there's, there's boundaries there and it different places.

1495
01:41:15.64 --> 01:41:16.64
You'll do different things.

1496
01:41:16.64 --> 01:41:17.64
That thing I described doesn't apply.

1497
01:41:17.64 --> 01:41:20.64
If you're at 25 miles away, you have different responses.

1498
01:41:20.64 --> 01:41:21.64
You're, you're spying on man.

1499
01:41:21.64 --> 01:41:30.04
So on both of them, to get too close to be in range is the safe thing to do.

1500
01:41:30.04 --> 01:41:31.04
It's not as intuitive.

1501
01:41:31.04 --> 01:41:33.40
You know, like if you don't take this, you can run.

1502
01:41:33.40 --> 01:41:34.40
Yep.

1503
01:41:34.40 --> 01:41:35.40
Yeah.

1504
01:41:35.40 --> 01:41:38.08
But you got to be at 25 miles to be able to run.

1505
01:41:38.08 --> 01:41:40.84
If you're at 25 miles, you've got to, well, you just have to know where you are.

1506
01:41:40.84 --> 01:41:43.96
It may be in a, in a fight three feet or there's a range.

1507
01:41:43.96 --> 01:41:46.000
And you have to know if you're inside or outside that range.

1508
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.28
Whatever the range is, it's certainly different than an airplane than in two people fighting.

1509
01:41:50.28 --> 01:41:51.44
But you actually have to know where you are.

1510
01:41:51.44 --> 01:41:54.88
Because if you make a decision inside of that range, you'll get yourself killed.

1511
01:41:54.88 --> 01:41:59.16
If you try to run in an airplane and you're to place where you can't, you'll die period.

1512
01:41:59.16 --> 01:42:00.16
No different.

1513
01:42:00.16 --> 01:42:03.16
And if you're inside that range and you try to close the distance, that will actually

1514
01:42:03.16 --> 01:42:04.56
keep you alive by getting closer.

1515
01:42:04.56 --> 01:42:05.56
Right.

1516
01:42:05.56 --> 01:42:06.96
And you just have to know where you are.

1517
01:42:06.96 --> 01:42:09.64
And when you're untrained, it doesn't seem that obvious.

1518
01:42:09.64 --> 01:42:11.72
Because when I'm to look, I'm fighting with Dave Burke.

1519
01:42:11.72 --> 01:42:13.12
He's punching me in the face.

1520
01:42:13.12 --> 01:42:17.12
My first instinct isn't to go towards those punches to the inside.

1521
01:42:17.12 --> 01:42:20.96
You see them saying, I mean, although they're definitely, they're definitely that kind of

1522
01:42:20.96 --> 01:42:23.72
isn't instinct or is that a training thing?

1523
01:42:23.72 --> 01:42:24.72
No, man.

1524
01:42:24.72 --> 01:42:27.60
If you try punching untrained person in the face, they're not only are they going to go away.

1525
01:42:27.60 --> 01:42:28.60
They're going to turn away.

1526
01:42:28.60 --> 01:42:29.60
They're going to turn their back.

1527
01:42:29.60 --> 01:42:31.08
They're going to run away.

1528
01:42:31.08 --> 01:42:32.08
Just instinctually.

1529
01:42:32.08 --> 01:42:33.08
Yeah.

1530
01:42:33.08 --> 01:42:34.08
For sure.

1531
01:42:34.08 --> 01:42:35.08
But if they have some training and whatever, then yeah.

1532
01:42:35.08 --> 01:42:39.000
So if they're in the cage or in the ring, as soon as someone starts getting hit, they

1533
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.60
know that they need to get close.

1534
01:42:40.60 --> 01:42:41.60
Yeah.

1535
01:42:41.60 --> 01:42:42.60
That's fully trained occasionally.

1536
01:42:42.60 --> 01:42:47.12
You'll see someone trying to run away even in the cage, even in an MMA actual fight.

1537
01:42:47.12 --> 01:42:49.64
Some will try to get away occasionally.

1538
01:42:49.64 --> 01:42:50.64
Yeah.

1539
01:42:50.64 --> 01:42:54.40
But either way, the guy who goes in and closes the distance when they're in trouble, that's

1540
01:42:54.40 --> 01:42:55.40
a trained person.

1541
01:42:55.40 --> 01:42:56.40
Yeah.

1542
01:42:56.40 --> 01:42:57.40
A hundred percent.

1543
01:42:57.40 --> 01:42:58.40
A hundred percent.

1544
01:42:58.40 --> 01:43:02.32
A hundred percent instinctive declaration.

1545
01:43:02.32 --> 01:43:03.32
Okay.

1546
01:43:03.32 --> 01:43:05.60
So you're talking 90, something percent.

1547
01:43:05.60 --> 01:43:06.60
High.

1548
01:43:06.60 --> 01:43:07.60
I think it's high.

1549
01:43:07.60 --> 01:43:09.24
I think hundred percent off the bat.

1550
01:43:09.24 --> 01:43:10.24
Yeah, you could be right.

1551
01:43:10.24 --> 01:43:11.88
Because I'm who untrained.

1552
01:43:11.88 --> 01:43:12.24
Yeah.

1553
01:43:12.24 --> 01:43:13.24
You ever named.

1554
01:43:13.24 --> 01:43:14.24
That's true.

1555
01:43:14.24 --> 01:43:16.92
Because I'm thinking, because what I'm thinking of is like, oh, you got some kid

1556
01:43:16.92 --> 01:43:19.08
that wrestled for two years in junior high school.

1557
01:43:19.08 --> 01:43:22.92
When he starts getting hit, he could very well close the distance.

1558
01:43:22.92 --> 01:43:23.92
Yeah.

1559
01:43:23.92 --> 01:43:24.92
Train.

1560
01:43:24.92 --> 01:43:26.24
But he's trying to get a good point.

1561
01:43:26.24 --> 01:43:27.64
Then again, what do I know?

1562
01:43:27.64 --> 01:43:28.64
That's what it seems like.

1563
01:43:28.64 --> 01:43:33.20
Isn't it weird that your intuition could be just wrong?

1564
01:43:33.20 --> 01:43:36.68
Yeah, because there's specific humor that a button's jitter like an integer to you go

1565
01:43:36.68 --> 01:43:39.24
man, this was a bad decision.

1566
01:43:39.24 --> 01:43:40.24
I just made it.

1567
01:43:40.24 --> 01:43:41.76
It seemed like a good idea.

1568
01:43:41.76 --> 01:43:42.76
It was not.

1569
01:43:42.76 --> 01:43:43.76
Yeah.

1570
01:43:43.76 --> 01:43:47.68
I would think that like in like the natural world that the intuition is going

1571
01:43:47.68 --> 01:43:48.68
to be correct.

1572
01:43:48.68 --> 01:43:49.68
That's what I think.

1573
01:43:49.68 --> 01:43:50.96
But I'm saying it's not.

1574
01:43:50.96 --> 01:43:51.96
That's what I'm saying.

1575
01:43:51.96 --> 01:43:57.20
No, but it's not when you're dealing with trained individuals, like basically manufactured

1576
01:43:57.20 --> 01:43:58.44
scenarios, you know?

1577
01:43:58.44 --> 01:44:00.76
And however chaotic the scenario is.

1578
01:44:00.76 --> 01:44:07.76
You're saying your two humans that grew up on deserted islands with you know, wild in

1579
01:44:07.76 --> 01:44:08.76
the wild.

1580
01:44:08.76 --> 01:44:13.28
Yeah, Dave starts like being aggressive towards me in one or another where it makes

1581
01:44:13.28 --> 01:44:14.28
me uncomfortable.

1582
01:44:14.28 --> 01:44:16.000
I'm leaving 100%.

1583
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.04
Even if he doesn't even throw punches, he just starts getting a great or I'm leaving.

1584
01:44:20.04 --> 01:44:21.04
Really?

1585
01:44:21.04 --> 01:44:22.44
What do you fight or fight?

1586
01:44:22.44 --> 01:44:23.44
Right?

1587
01:44:23.44 --> 01:44:24.44
Flight is like one of them.

1588
01:44:24.44 --> 01:44:25.44
He starts punching me in the face.

1589
01:44:25.44 --> 01:44:26.44
I'm leaving.

1590
01:44:26.44 --> 01:44:28.40
I can get away from those punches or whatever.

1591
01:44:28.40 --> 01:44:31.88
But if he's trained or if he knows I'm going to leave, they're there, it becomes

1592
01:44:31.88 --> 01:44:32.88
the training.

1593
01:44:32.88 --> 01:44:33.88
So you'm saying I'm trained.

1594
01:44:33.88 --> 01:44:36.32
I know he's going to leave for some, I've been through that experience.

1595
01:44:36.32 --> 01:44:37.32
You're saying?

1596
01:44:37.32 --> 01:44:40.92
Yeah, I just know that sometimes my instincts are really bad.

1597
01:44:40.92 --> 01:44:41.92
Oh, yeah, mine too.

1598
01:44:41.92 --> 01:44:44.92
Probably like 99% of the time.

1599
01:44:44.92 --> 01:44:45.92
Yeah.

1600
01:44:45.92 --> 01:44:46.92
Connaless.

1601
01:44:46.92 --> 01:44:47.92
It's a secret.

1602
01:44:47.92 --> 01:44:48.92
It's a secret, yeah.

1603
01:44:48.92 --> 01:44:53.12
Take you to the, you will get good instincts trained into you because they become

1604
01:44:53.12 --> 01:44:54.12
instincts.

1605
01:44:54.12 --> 01:44:55.12
They're coming in.

1606
01:44:55.12 --> 01:44:56.12
They're coming in.

1607
01:44:56.12 --> 01:44:57.12
Yeah.

1608
01:44:57.12 --> 01:44:58.12
They're not trained into you nonetheless.

1609
01:44:58.12 --> 01:44:59.12
There's nothing better.

1610
01:44:59.12 --> 01:45:00.64
You know what I have an instinct for?

1611
01:45:00.64 --> 01:45:05.32
And I don't mean this to be, I'm not trying to attack you right now, like verbally.

1612
01:45:05.32 --> 01:45:10.92
But it means my instinct is to grab you in a guillotine.

1613
01:45:10.92 --> 01:45:12.48
My hand just goes there.

1614
01:45:12.48 --> 01:45:13.96
I do not want our training.

1615
01:45:13.96 --> 01:45:14.96
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1616
01:45:14.96 --> 01:45:17.36
For like when we're training for real, I just have you in a guillotine.

1617
01:45:17.36 --> 01:45:19.000
I'm like, boo, we're rolling in the room.

1618
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Yeah.

1619
01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.40
I don't know what happened.

1620
01:45:21.40 --> 01:45:22.40
Boom.

1621
01:45:22.40 --> 01:45:23.40
I've got you in a guillotine.

1622
01:45:23.40 --> 01:45:24.40
Yeah.

1623
01:45:24.40 --> 01:45:25.80
I'm not saying you're going to tap, but I'm saying it's there.

1624
01:45:25.80 --> 01:45:26.80
Yes, I agree.

1625
01:45:26.80 --> 01:45:31.16
Yeah, that is one of the things for sure nonetheless.

1626
01:45:31.16 --> 01:45:34.36
When everyone starts to do you two, they're going to need what?

1627
01:45:34.36 --> 01:45:39.40
A gui, a rash guard, and the desire to train really.

1628
01:45:39.40 --> 01:45:40.40
That's what it comes down to.

1629
01:45:40.40 --> 01:45:42.44
I want a place to train.

1630
01:45:42.44 --> 01:45:44.32
And people to train with essentially because you can't.

1631
01:45:44.32 --> 01:45:47.08
That's the big drawback from DJ to you, and you need another human.

1632
01:45:47.08 --> 01:45:48.08
Yes.

1633
01:45:48.08 --> 01:45:49.96
But as far as the guis and the rash guards, what kind of guis you're going to get?

1634
01:45:49.96 --> 01:45:52.32
Because that's still a question.

1635
01:45:52.32 --> 01:45:53.32
It's still a question.

1636
01:45:53.32 --> 01:45:54.32
This shouldn't be a question.

1637
01:45:54.32 --> 01:45:55.32
Way less prevalent now.

1638
01:45:55.32 --> 01:46:00.28
But if you didn't know, you get an origin gui, where do you get them from origin main.com?

1639
01:46:00.28 --> 01:46:01.28
Dave Burke.

1640
01:46:01.28 --> 01:46:03.76
Do you have an origin gui?

1641
01:46:03.76 --> 01:46:05.28
I have two origin guis.

1642
01:46:05.28 --> 01:46:06.28
Boom.

1643
01:46:06.28 --> 01:46:07.28
I use them all the time.

1644
01:46:07.28 --> 01:46:08.28
How many guis do you have?

1645
01:46:08.28 --> 01:46:09.28
Two.

1646
01:46:09.28 --> 01:46:12.56
That one, the use of phrase 100%.

1647
01:46:12.56 --> 01:46:14.16
That applies to the number of guis that I have.

1648
01:46:14.16 --> 01:46:15.16
That's an origin gui.

1649
01:46:15.16 --> 01:46:16.16
Boom.

1650
01:46:16.16 --> 01:46:17.16
Well, good.

1651
01:46:17.16 --> 01:46:19.16
Got some rash guards in there as well.

1652
01:46:19.16 --> 01:46:20.16
Those are good ones.

1653
01:46:20.16 --> 01:46:21.16
Also jeans.

1654
01:46:21.16 --> 01:46:22.16
Merch and denim.

1655
01:46:22.16 --> 01:46:23.16
Yeah.

1656
01:46:23.16 --> 01:46:24.16
American denim.

1657
01:46:24.16 --> 01:46:29.68
Marca made by the team up in Maine.

1658
01:46:29.68 --> 01:46:31.24
You know, those are good.

1659
01:46:31.24 --> 01:46:32.88
Surprisingly fashionable.

1660
01:46:32.88 --> 01:46:35.32
Not overly fashionable.

1661
01:46:35.32 --> 01:46:37.40
That would be a horrible thing.

1662
01:46:37.40 --> 01:46:38.40
Yeah.

1663
01:46:38.40 --> 01:46:42.76
If we started venturing into, well, then that would have to come from Pete.

1664
01:46:42.76 --> 01:46:45.32
Who can be a little bit more overly fashionable?

1665
01:46:45.32 --> 01:46:46.56
Here's the thing about pito.

1666
01:46:46.56 --> 01:46:47.56
He's from Maine.

1667
01:46:47.56 --> 01:46:52.08
So Maine is not exactly the fashion hub of the you know, all states.

1668
01:46:52.08 --> 01:46:53.08
I'm not exactly.

1669
01:46:53.08 --> 01:46:54.08
I'm not.

1670
01:46:54.08 --> 01:46:58.08
like, you know, disparaging his fashion sense. I'm not.

1671
01:46:58.08 --> 01:46:59.000
But I'm so innocent.

1672
01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.68
My relative to the world, relative to LA New York and Paris.

1673
01:47:04.68 --> 01:47:06.44
Yeah, you go right in the middle of Paris.

1674
01:47:06.44 --> 01:47:08.76
Yes, and you say, hey, guys,

1675
01:47:08.76 --> 01:47:11.44
Pete has no fashion sense if he's in Paris is what I'm

1676
01:47:11.44 --> 01:47:12.28
right.

1677
01:47:12.28 --> 01:47:14.88
Yes, that is exactly what he's performing in Maine.

1678
01:47:14.88 --> 01:47:16.08
Yeah, he's kind of a priest.

1679
01:47:16.08 --> 01:47:17.08
He's kind of a style.

1680
01:47:17.08 --> 01:47:19.56
Yes, yeah, which to me is perfect.

1681
01:47:19.56 --> 01:47:20.20
Yeah.

1682
01:47:20.20 --> 01:47:22.44
It winds up to be perfect because it's on the mildly.

1683
01:47:22.44 --> 01:47:26.04
It's my house. He's like straight from Paris.

1684
01:47:26.04 --> 01:47:31.24
In my house, he's like a guy from Paris or a guy from New York.

1685
01:47:31.24 --> 01:47:34.48
Yeah, and that's walking off the catwalk into my living room.

1686
01:47:34.48 --> 01:47:35.24
That's what I see.

1687
01:47:35.24 --> 01:47:37.32
You know, well, you got the jeans so boom.

1688
01:47:37.32 --> 01:47:38.08
You're in that house.

1689
01:47:38.08 --> 01:47:38.64
That's what I'm saying.

1690
01:47:38.64 --> 01:47:43.92
Luckily, the jeans are, are, they're, they're functional.

1691
01:47:43.92 --> 01:47:44.68
Was the deal.

1692
01:47:44.68 --> 01:47:44.96
Yeah.

1693
01:47:44.96 --> 01:47:46.16
That's straight functional.

1694
01:47:46.16 --> 01:47:47.40
And talk to you look good in them.

1695
01:47:47.40 --> 01:47:48.16
Let's face it.

1696
01:47:48.16 --> 01:47:52.40
Oh, well, I'm not over here looking at me or other people.

1697
01:47:52.40 --> 01:47:53.40
I'm looking at you.

1698
01:47:53.40 --> 01:47:54.96
Right here the man.

1699
01:47:54.96 --> 01:47:57.40
Hey, got a bunch of other stuff on there.

1700
01:47:57.40 --> 01:48:01.40
T-shirts, joggers, which echo likes.

1701
01:48:01.40 --> 01:48:03.44
I cannot wear joggers.

1702
01:48:03.44 --> 01:48:05.24
Yeah, that's too far for you.

1703
01:48:05.24 --> 01:48:06.24
100%.

1704
01:48:06.24 --> 01:48:09.04
And then there's also supplements.

1705
01:48:09.04 --> 01:48:10.04
Jocals.

1706
01:48:10.04 --> 01:48:16.48
Dave, how does your daughter like, how does your oldest daughter like strawberry milk?

1707
01:48:16.48 --> 01:48:18.32
It's funny to ask.

1708
01:48:18.32 --> 01:48:20.44
We were actually talking about this the other day.

1709
01:48:20.44 --> 01:48:24.000
I was describing on the last podcast how good strawberry milk tasted.

1710
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.48
And I was trying to use find the right words.

1711
01:48:27.48 --> 01:48:29.28
So I give my son strawberry milk.

1712
01:48:29.28 --> 01:48:30.28
Hmm.

1713
01:48:30.28 --> 01:48:31.72
Because he's, he's five.

1714
01:48:31.72 --> 01:48:32.72
Yeah.

1715
01:48:32.72 --> 01:48:33.72
He likes milk.

1716
01:48:33.72 --> 01:48:34.72
It's good for him.

1717
01:48:34.72 --> 01:48:35.72
Yeah.

1718
01:48:35.72 --> 01:48:36.72
You know, he's got a bit of a sweet tooth.

1719
01:48:36.72 --> 01:48:38.48
So we're not doing Nestle Quaker in that crap.

1720
01:48:38.48 --> 01:48:39.48
We don't do it.

1721
01:48:39.48 --> 01:48:40.88
So, oh, because you don't want to poison your own children.

1722
01:48:40.88 --> 01:48:41.88
No, I don't.

1723
01:48:41.88 --> 01:48:44.12
I love my kids and I don't want to poison them.

1724
01:48:44.12 --> 01:48:45.52
And they don't have that as a frame.

1725
01:48:45.52 --> 01:48:46.36
He's never had it.

1726
01:48:46.36 --> 01:48:47.36
So he doesn't know.

1727
01:48:47.36 --> 01:48:49.92
He just knows the stuff tastes good.

1728
01:48:49.92 --> 01:48:54.28
My daughter, my oldest daughter, snagged tip the bottle from him, slid it off the table,

1729
01:48:54.28 --> 01:48:55.28
towards her.

1730
01:48:55.28 --> 01:48:56.68
I was sitting across him her.

1731
01:48:56.68 --> 01:48:57.68
We weren't talking.

1732
01:48:57.68 --> 01:48:58.68
I was just watching her.

1733
01:48:58.68 --> 01:49:01.64
She took the bottle, drank a sip of his strawberry milk.

1734
01:49:01.64 --> 01:49:06.24
And she closed her eyes and looked up at the sky with her eyes closed and just said,

1735
01:49:06.24 --> 01:49:08.24
to her to herself.

1736
01:49:08.24 --> 01:49:09.24
It's so good.

1737
01:49:09.24 --> 01:49:14.42
That's when I'm like, that's when I knew that how, that's how I feel about

1738
01:49:14.42 --> 01:49:17.24
strawberry milk is what she said to herself about how good it is.

1739
01:49:17.24 --> 01:49:18.24
It is that.

1740
01:49:18.24 --> 01:49:19.24
Yeah.

1741
01:49:19.24 --> 01:49:27.08
Strawberry seems to be to many people kind of the, the top of the taste pyramid.

1742
01:49:27.08 --> 01:49:29.12
I will say this though.

1743
01:49:29.12 --> 01:49:33.12
I can go two strawberries maybe three.

1744
01:49:33.12 --> 01:49:38.000
Now I did go on like a full on strawberry rampage when it first came out.

1745
01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.84
You're talking about the adult.

1746
01:49:39.84 --> 01:49:40.84
We don't have a right there.

1747
01:49:40.84 --> 01:49:42.76
The kids want us delicious too.

1748
01:49:42.76 --> 01:49:49.04
But the adult strawberry milk, I went on like a three week rampage of just strawberry.

1749
01:49:49.04 --> 01:49:52.68
And now I'm back to it's in the rotation.

1750
01:49:52.68 --> 01:49:56.96
It's like two strawberries meant strawberry peanut butter.

1751
01:49:56.96 --> 01:49:58.32
I'm probably a month behind.

1752
01:49:58.32 --> 01:50:00.32
I think I got about a month behind you.

1753
01:50:00.32 --> 01:50:01.32
So I'm okay.

1754
01:50:01.32 --> 01:50:05.000
So you're just so actually today on the way here, I went back to mint.

1755
01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.92
Had a double scoop of mint on the way here with that little scoop of hair.

1756
01:50:08.92 --> 01:50:09.92
And I was reminded.

1757
01:50:09.92 --> 01:50:10.92
Yeah.

1758
01:50:10.92 --> 01:50:12.92
The mint was so good.

1759
01:50:12.92 --> 01:50:13.92
It was so good.

1760
01:50:13.92 --> 01:50:17.36
So I have finally just come off the exclusive strawberry train.

1761
01:50:17.36 --> 01:50:18.36
Yeah.

1762
01:50:18.36 --> 01:50:20.16
I was surprised strawberry is still good to go.

1763
01:50:20.16 --> 01:50:21.16
Oh yeah.

1764
01:50:21.16 --> 01:50:23.24
I was reminded of how good the mint was today.

1765
01:50:23.24 --> 01:50:24.24
You know what the cool thing is?

1766
01:50:24.24 --> 01:50:25.92
This isn't like being married.

1767
01:50:25.92 --> 01:50:27.64
You didn't get married to strawberry.

1768
01:50:27.64 --> 01:50:28.64
No.

1769
01:50:28.64 --> 01:50:30.32
The strawberry tastes good.

1770
01:50:30.32 --> 01:50:34.48
But you can still just get that mint back on if you want to get that mint.

1771
01:50:34.48 --> 01:50:36.48
That little peanut butter.

1772
01:50:36.48 --> 01:50:37.48
The one scoop.

1773
01:50:37.48 --> 01:50:42.44
If you get the one scoop peanut butter, I'm talking that thing is just a little bit

1774
01:50:42.44 --> 01:50:45.28
of dead fatl tied you over.

1775
01:50:45.28 --> 01:50:46.28
So that's the milk.

1776
01:50:46.28 --> 01:50:47.88
You can get some of that milk.

1777
01:50:47.88 --> 01:50:49.92
You can go.

1778
01:50:49.92 --> 01:50:54.16
This you you Dave each time you've come on this podcast.

1779
01:50:54.16 --> 01:50:56.000
The past three straight podcasts.

1780
01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.44
I see you doing something a little bit ritualistic scenario going on over there.

1781
01:51:00.44 --> 01:51:02.12
For you you put something in your mouth.

1782
01:51:02.12 --> 01:51:03.12
You swallow it.

1783
01:51:03.12 --> 01:51:04.12
What is that all about?

1784
01:51:04.12 --> 01:51:12.52
That's the the discipline go to prep me for having my head in the game.

1785
01:51:12.52 --> 01:51:14.12
Which I want on this podcast.

1786
01:51:14.12 --> 01:51:16.64
Actually, I want to be in the game all the time to be honest with you.

1787
01:51:16.64 --> 01:51:20.92
I can't think of any place where I don't want to really be in the game other than getting

1788
01:51:20.92 --> 01:51:22.32
ready to go to bed.

1789
01:51:22.32 --> 01:51:26.80
So the discipline go pills.

1790
01:51:26.80 --> 01:51:30.20
If I'm going to do something that requires me to think, I'm taking it.

1791
01:51:30.20 --> 01:51:32.20
To include this podcast.

1792
01:51:32.20 --> 01:51:36.000
It's you can feel it without question you can feel it.

1793
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.96
But it's it's subtle to it doesn't like it's not like getting the head with the hammer.

1794
01:51:39.96 --> 01:51:44.24
It's it's it's a subtle get you up on the step and you look and you're like, oh, I'm in

1795
01:51:44.24 --> 01:51:45.24
the game.

1796
01:51:45.24 --> 01:51:46.40
And you can feel the during the game.

1797
01:51:46.40 --> 01:51:48.44
It wasn't like a big shock to the system.

1798
01:51:48.44 --> 01:51:51.16
It gets you up there subtly and then you're there.

1799
01:51:51.16 --> 01:51:53.52
And actually you can stay there for a while.

1800
01:51:53.52 --> 01:51:58.04
Yeah, what I look is you look around like two hours later and you're like, you know, this

1801
01:51:58.04 --> 01:52:02.56
be I'm on fire and you're like, oh, yeah, that's right.

1802
01:52:02.56 --> 01:52:03.56
That's right.

1803
01:52:03.56 --> 01:52:04.56
That's what just happened.

1804
01:52:04.56 --> 01:52:06.64
Yeah, you mentioned the warrior kid milk.

1805
01:52:06.64 --> 01:52:09.52
So there's the warrior kid milk.

1806
01:52:09.52 --> 01:52:15.04
And then we have a chocolate which is, you know, summertime.

1807
01:52:15.04 --> 01:52:17.44
I got the cans.

1808
01:52:17.44 --> 01:52:18.84
They're just sitting around my house.

1809
01:52:18.84 --> 01:52:19.68
They're in the fridge.

1810
01:52:19.68 --> 01:52:23.04
They're just getting pulled out my whole family's just cracking out on Dr.

1811
01:52:23.04 --> 01:52:24.04
Koyte.

1812
01:52:24.04 --> 01:52:28.60
So get that a try and don't forget the joint warfare and krill oil.

1813
01:52:28.60 --> 01:52:29.60
Big part.

1814
01:52:29.60 --> 01:52:33.28
See, see even how you're just like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1815
01:52:33.28 --> 01:52:35.68
Like, yeah, it's just so that's a given.

1816
01:52:35.68 --> 01:52:36.68
Yeah.

1817
01:52:36.68 --> 01:52:37.68
And here's the thing.

1818
01:52:37.68 --> 01:52:38.68
It is a given too.

1819
01:52:38.68 --> 01:52:39.68
That's another one.

1820
01:52:39.68 --> 01:52:43.20
So I mean, if you're working out which we are, the tone in my voice was actually like

1821
01:52:43.20 --> 01:52:45.80
apologetic to the world, that's right.

1822
01:52:45.80 --> 01:52:46.80
Yeah, yeah.

1823
01:52:46.80 --> 01:52:47.12
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1824
01:52:47.12 --> 01:52:51.76
I can't believe I forgot that because if you're not doing that, the reason why I can

1825
01:52:51.76 --> 01:52:56.16
forget it is because when I brush my teeth in the morning, yeah, I'm taken joint warfare

1826
01:52:56.16 --> 01:53:00.88
when I brush my teeth at night and floss, I'm taking joint warfare, and I'm taking krill

1827
01:53:00.88 --> 01:53:01.88
oil.

1828
01:53:01.88 --> 01:53:06.04
So that's just, that's just how that's just how you say in Hawaii.

1829
01:53:06.04 --> 01:53:09.16
Oh, yeah, 100%, but some people, maybe they don't know.

1830
01:53:09.16 --> 01:53:12.04
Maybe I think most of us do, but yes, let's not forget that.

1831
01:53:12.04 --> 01:53:16.60
That's the point, Krill oil joint warfare, keep yourself physically in the game.

1832
01:53:16.60 --> 01:53:17.60
So you can do whatever.

1833
01:53:17.60 --> 01:53:19.60
Let me lift, did you do it too?

1834
01:53:19.60 --> 01:53:20.60
Boom.

1835
01:53:20.60 --> 01:53:21.60
Let me lift.

1836
01:53:21.60 --> 01:53:23.08
Oh yeah, I'm just saying lifting that.

1837
01:53:23.08 --> 01:53:24.80
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1838
01:53:24.80 --> 01:53:25.80
You're taking it for granted.

1839
01:53:25.80 --> 01:53:29.08
I got back into back squats by the way.

1840
01:53:29.08 --> 01:53:32.28
Oh, laying down in bed with my wife.

1841
01:53:32.28 --> 01:53:33.28
That's right.

1842
01:53:33.28 --> 01:53:34.28
I said it.

1843
01:53:34.28 --> 01:53:37.60
And she even said, like your legs look big right now.

1844
01:53:37.60 --> 01:53:40.08
She didn't know I got back into back squats.

1845
01:53:40.08 --> 01:53:43.60
What she said about your knee.

1846
01:53:43.60 --> 01:53:45.80
So far.

1847
01:53:45.80 --> 01:53:50.72
Anyway, yeah, so those supplements are outstanding.

1848
01:53:50.72 --> 01:53:52.52
And yeah, keep yourself in the game.

1849
01:53:52.52 --> 01:53:54.08
Get in the game, keep yourself in the game.

1850
01:53:54.08 --> 01:53:55.08
That's how.

1851
01:53:55.08 --> 01:53:56.92
Also, we have our own store.

1852
01:53:56.92 --> 01:53:58.88
It's called JockelStorex, just like you mentioned.

1853
01:53:58.88 --> 01:54:00.08
JockelStore.com.

1854
01:54:00.08 --> 01:54:02.64
This is where you can get the rash guards, t-shirt.

1855
01:54:02.64 --> 01:54:05.08
So you're going to represent while you're on the path.

1856
01:54:05.08 --> 01:54:07.08
This is where you can get this to the merch.

1857
01:54:07.08 --> 01:54:10.28
There's a word. My daughter keeps saying that.

1858
01:54:10.28 --> 01:54:11.08
You're a daughter.

1859
01:54:11.08 --> 01:54:12.08
It's only six years old.

1860
01:54:12.08 --> 01:54:13.08
Yes, sir.

1861
01:54:13.08 --> 01:54:13.08
I know.

1862
01:54:13.08 --> 01:54:14.08
And then she say a merch.

1863
01:54:14.08 --> 01:54:17.08
Because she watches these YouTube videos and their like,

1864
01:54:17.08 --> 01:54:18.08
I'm a touch.

1865
01:54:18.08 --> 01:54:21.08
The merch and I'm like, it's kind of the thing is,

1866
01:54:21.08 --> 01:54:23.08
you know how you're so biased towards your kids.

1867
01:54:23.08 --> 01:54:24.08
Well, I am.

1868
01:54:24.08 --> 01:54:25.08
I don't know what you but.

1869
01:54:25.08 --> 01:54:27.08
And they say something like kind of whack.

1870
01:54:27.08 --> 01:54:28.08
And you're like, oh, that's so cute.

1871
01:54:28.08 --> 01:54:30.08
I'm in that boat right now with a little bit of a whack.

1872
01:54:30.08 --> 01:54:33.08
With the word I recognize that it's not cool.

1873
01:54:33.08 --> 01:54:34.08
Correct.

1874
01:54:34.08 --> 01:54:37.08
That's right. Yeah. Then the last. If you want merch,

1875
01:54:37.08 --> 01:54:38.08
jockels.org.com.

1876
01:54:38.08 --> 01:54:39.08
Truckers hats.

1877
01:54:39.08 --> 01:54:40.08
Yeah.

1878
01:54:40.08 --> 01:54:41.08
Beenies.

1879
01:54:41.08 --> 01:54:42.08
Yes.

1880
01:54:42.08 --> 01:54:43.08
Hoodies.

1881
01:54:43.08 --> 01:54:44.08
Hoodies.

1882
01:54:44.08 --> 01:54:46.08
Lightweight. And they've Brooks here.

1883
01:54:46.08 --> 01:54:47.08
Yeah, no.

1884
01:54:47.08 --> 01:54:49.08
Lightweight.

1885
01:54:49.08 --> 01:54:51.08
Hoodie approved when we're at this house.

1886
01:54:51.08 --> 01:54:53.08
Like he approved it verbally to me.

1887
01:54:53.08 --> 01:54:54.08
Oh, yeah.

1888
01:54:54.08 --> 01:54:55.08
Big time.

1889
01:54:55.08 --> 01:54:56.08
My little brother, can you have the Charles?

1890
01:54:56.08 --> 01:54:57.08
That's his name.

1891
01:54:57.08 --> 01:54:58.08
By the way, listen, why?

1892
01:54:58.08 --> 01:55:02.08
He went out of his way to tell me that that light weight is an

1893
01:55:02.08 --> 01:55:04.08
E.

1894
01:55:04.08 --> 01:55:05.08
I understand.

1895
01:55:05.08 --> 01:55:06.08
Which is.

1896
01:55:06.08 --> 01:55:08.08
Of course, my life's felt like what would you do with a full weight hoodie.

1897
01:55:08.08 --> 01:55:09.08
Oh, yeah.

1898
01:55:09.08 --> 01:55:10.08
I don't know.

1899
01:55:10.08 --> 01:55:11.08
Come on, man.

1900
01:55:11.08 --> 01:55:12.08
Give me a better example.

1901
01:55:12.08 --> 01:55:13.08
No, man.

1902
01:55:13.08 --> 01:55:14.08
These are not back.

1903
01:55:14.08 --> 01:55:15.08
Dave, Liz and San Diego.

1904
01:55:15.08 --> 01:55:16.08
Here's the thing.

1905
01:55:16.08 --> 01:55:18.08
How about my people up in Michigan?

1906
01:55:18.08 --> 01:55:21.08
It would be obvious if you've talking only about the functionality of it.

1907
01:55:21.08 --> 01:55:23.08
But he was talking about everything.

1908
01:55:23.08 --> 01:55:26.08
The feel, the fit, the look.

1909
01:55:26.08 --> 01:55:27.08
Chewy.

1910
01:55:27.08 --> 01:55:28.08
They're good.

1911
01:55:28.08 --> 01:55:29.08
Hatties.

1912
01:55:29.08 --> 01:55:36.08
Also subscribe to this podcast if you haven't already because echo thinks you might not of.

1913
01:55:36.08 --> 01:55:38.08
And then don't forget about the Warrior Kid podcast.

1914
01:55:38.08 --> 01:55:44.08
That one you could forget to because I haven't put it out as often as I should.

1915
01:55:44.08 --> 01:55:45.08
But I should put it out more.

1916
01:55:45.08 --> 01:55:49.08
A lot of parents just have the Warrior Kid podcast on repeat.

1917
01:55:49.08 --> 01:55:52.08
Dave, do the lessons sink in from the Warrior Kid podcast.

1918
01:55:52.08 --> 01:55:53.08
They do.

1919
01:55:53.08 --> 01:55:59.04
I have learned that my kids understand more than I thought they would understand because I watch

1920
01:55:59.04 --> 01:56:04.04
the other react to the lessons I learned in the podcast and the books they sink in.

1921
01:56:04.04 --> 01:56:10.04
If you want to get some soap get it from Irish Oaks Ranch.com because there's a young Warrior

1922
01:56:10.04 --> 01:56:18.04
kid named Aiden who's living on a farm and he's making soap from goat milk.

1923
01:56:18.04 --> 01:56:19.04
Jocquist soap.

1924
01:56:19.04 --> 01:56:22.04
And if you use that soap you can stay clean.

1925
01:56:22.04 --> 01:56:23.04
It's a good one.

1926
01:56:23.04 --> 01:56:28.04
And don't forget about our YouTube channel because echo wants you to watch the video.

1927
01:56:28.04 --> 01:56:30.04
It's an e-makes.

1928
01:56:30.04 --> 01:56:33.04
And he's super excited and thinks that they look cool.

1929
01:56:33.04 --> 01:56:37.04
He's like the paris of movie making.

1930
01:56:37.04 --> 01:56:43.04
So much is time to give up on one of your little extra podcast.

1931
01:56:43.04 --> 01:56:46.04
Number 180, whatever's up.

1932
01:56:46.04 --> 01:56:49.04
Someone wrote music was a little much.

1933
01:56:49.04 --> 01:56:50.04
Yeah.

1934
01:56:50.04 --> 01:56:51.04
I was like, day.

1935
01:56:51.04 --> 01:56:53.04
Come on off the top rope.

1936
01:56:53.04 --> 01:56:55.04
That's a little crazy, right?

1937
01:56:55.04 --> 01:56:58.04
Well, it's a one. It's a 52 second video.

1938
01:56:58.04 --> 01:56:59.04
It's not even one minute.

1939
01:56:59.04 --> 01:57:02.04
And someone said, echo's a music's a little much.

1940
01:57:02.04 --> 01:57:03.04
Yeah.

1941
01:57:03.04 --> 01:57:07.04
Well, you know, I am used to that comment because let's face it sometimes.

1942
01:57:07.04 --> 01:57:08.04
It is.

1943
01:57:08.04 --> 01:57:09.04
It is a little much I get it.

1944
01:57:09.04 --> 01:57:10.04
It's true.

1945
01:57:10.04 --> 01:57:13.04
But at the same time, it depends on what he meant overall.

1946
01:57:13.04 --> 01:57:16.04
Like a little what little too loud or wasn't too aggressive.

1947
01:57:16.04 --> 01:57:18.04
No, I feel like the choice is like to dramatic.

1948
01:57:18.04 --> 01:57:20.04
Or the fact that there's music at all.

1949
01:57:20.04 --> 01:57:22.04
You know, there's just too dramatic.

1950
01:57:22.04 --> 01:57:28.04
You get much the the cello players of the world are real appreciative of your musical taste.

1951
01:57:28.04 --> 01:57:32.04
You did they break out the cellos and you break out the recorder.

1952
01:57:32.04 --> 01:57:38.04
So yeah, if you want to check out little excerpts of this, get the.

1953
01:57:38.04 --> 01:57:40.04
Get the YouTube channel.

1954
01:57:40.04 --> 01:57:42.04
Subscribe to it.

1955
01:57:42.04 --> 01:57:43.04
Smash the link.

1956
01:57:43.04 --> 01:57:44.04
I know.

1957
01:57:44.04 --> 01:57:45.04
I did.

1958
01:57:45.04 --> 01:57:46.04
You did it.

1959
01:57:46.04 --> 01:57:47.04
That's awesome.

1960
01:57:47.04 --> 01:57:49.04
Dave psychological warfare.

1961
01:57:49.04 --> 01:57:54.04
Do you ever have to press play on psychological warfare?

1962
01:57:54.04 --> 01:57:57.04
Unfortunately, once in a blue moon.

1963
01:57:57.04 --> 01:57:59.04
Yeah, I've got it down pretty good at this point.

1964
01:57:59.04 --> 01:58:02.04
But I have what I call psychological warfare in my head.

1965
01:58:02.04 --> 01:58:03.04
Yeah.

1966
01:58:03.04 --> 01:58:04.04
I kind of know what you're going to say at this point.

1967
01:58:04.04 --> 01:58:07.04
So the reality is is I don't need that resource because it's.

1968
01:58:07.04 --> 01:58:09.04
It's there permanently embedded.

1969
01:58:09.04 --> 01:58:11.04
Yeah, I know what you're going to say at this point.

1970
01:58:11.04 --> 01:58:15.04
Yeah, and that's a good point because it's like it's one thing to like listen to it.

1971
01:58:15.04 --> 01:58:17.04
Let's say for the first second, third time or whatever.

1972
01:58:17.04 --> 01:58:20.04
It's like, oh yeah, you're right. You're writing your fired up to sort of do it.

1973
01:58:20.04 --> 01:58:23.04
But at the same time, you're not just getting like jockel like.

1974
01:58:23.04 --> 01:58:26.04
I hate to say it like motivating you to do it.

1975
01:58:26.04 --> 01:58:27.04
You're motivating you with logic.

1976
01:58:27.04 --> 01:58:28.04
Don't get it wrong.

1977
01:58:28.04 --> 01:58:32.04
But you still are getting motivated after while that actual logic gets embedded in your head.

1978
01:58:32.04 --> 01:58:35.04
No, that's the transition from imposed discipline to self-discipline.

1979
01:58:35.04 --> 01:58:36.04
Oh, yeah, right there.

1980
01:58:36.04 --> 01:58:37.04
You know the message.

1981
01:58:37.04 --> 01:58:40.04
You know like, oh, hey, yeah, like you don't feel like doing it.

1982
01:58:40.04 --> 01:58:41.04
But you know you're supposed to do it.

1983
01:58:41.04 --> 01:58:42.04
You know how you're going to feel afterwards.

1984
01:58:42.04 --> 01:58:44.04
And you know the results and the thing is that's a fact.

1985
01:58:44.04 --> 01:58:47.04
So you get reminded of it so many times.

1986
01:58:47.04 --> 01:58:48.04
You listen to it.

1987
01:58:48.04 --> 01:58:50.04
Then you kind of like, oh, yeah, I kind of know that.

1988
01:58:50.04 --> 01:58:52.04
So you can essentially tell yourself that.

1989
01:58:52.04 --> 01:58:53.04
Yes.

1990
01:58:53.04 --> 01:58:57.04
So if you want that, it's on iTunes Google Play and B3.

1991
01:58:57.04 --> 01:58:58.04
Flipside Canvas.

1992
01:58:58.04 --> 01:59:04.04
If you want a visual reminder of the path, go to flipsidecampus.com.

1993
01:59:04.04 --> 01:59:07.04
My brother Dakota Meyer running that thing.

1994
01:59:07.04 --> 01:59:10.04
Making art.

1995
01:59:10.04 --> 01:59:14.04
Dang on your walls with layer with layers, multiple layers.

1996
01:59:14.04 --> 01:59:15.04
Oh, yeah, big time.

1997
01:59:15.04 --> 01:59:21.04
Also on it on it.com slash chocolate, by the way, this is where you can get fitness gear.

1998
01:59:21.04 --> 01:59:22.04
Some good.

1999
01:59:22.04 --> 01:59:24.04
I have this electrolyte supplement that I get.

2000
01:59:24.04 --> 01:59:25.04
It's like a go to by the way.

2001
01:59:25.04 --> 01:59:27.04
It's like electrolyte minerals and whatnot.

2002
01:59:27.04 --> 01:59:28.04
Anyway, get it from on it.

2003
01:59:28.04 --> 01:59:32.04
And so the rings that you so strongly.

2004
01:59:32.04 --> 01:59:35.04
How should I say recommended early on?

2005
01:59:35.04 --> 01:59:36.04
Mm-hmm.

2006
01:59:36.04 --> 01:59:37.04
Coming handy.

2007
01:59:37.04 --> 01:59:38.04
So I brought them to my trip to Coi.

2008
01:59:38.04 --> 01:59:41.04
Oh, yeah, here's the thing about those rings though.

2009
01:59:41.04 --> 01:59:44.04
You have to kind of think ahead on where to hang on.

2010
01:59:44.04 --> 01:59:45.04
She's saying.

2011
01:59:45.04 --> 01:59:46.04
It's not that hard.

2012
01:59:46.04 --> 01:59:47.04
I know.

2013
01:59:47.04 --> 01:59:49.04
But I found myself in a situation where I'm like searching.

2014
01:59:49.04 --> 01:59:51.04
You can't just hang them from the ceiling fence.

2015
01:59:51.04 --> 01:59:54.04
You've just got to find a core manual of adaptation.

2016
01:59:54.04 --> 01:59:55.04
Yeah.

2017
01:59:55.04 --> 01:59:56.04
Previously anticipating.

2018
01:59:56.04 --> 01:59:58.04
Even if you got to hang them from the tree.

2019
01:59:58.04 --> 02:00:01.04
But the last point is it's not like a squat.

2020
02:00:01.04 --> 02:00:04.04
You can't just bring the squat rack to Coi with you.

2021
02:00:04.04 --> 02:00:06.04
You're saying you got to go to Coi.

2022
02:00:06.04 --> 02:00:07.04
You're saying you got to go to Coi.

2023
02:00:07.04 --> 02:00:08.04
But the rings they go with you.

2024
02:00:08.04 --> 02:00:09.04
Boom.

2025
02:00:09.04 --> 02:00:10.04
From in the suitcase.

2026
02:00:10.04 --> 02:00:12.04
I carry literally carry the rings on the plane.

2027
02:00:12.04 --> 02:00:13.04
Whatever.

2028
02:00:13.04 --> 02:00:14.04
So it's easy.

2029
02:00:14.04 --> 02:00:15.04
And then you can get that workout.

2030
02:00:15.04 --> 02:00:19.44
Not to mention the workouts from rings are going to be a lot better than if you don't have

2031
02:00:19.44 --> 02:00:20.44
ring.

2032
02:00:20.44 --> 02:00:22.04
Anyway, get this last stuff.

2033
02:00:22.04 --> 02:00:24.04
Good kettlebells on there.

2034
02:00:24.04 --> 02:00:27.04
Decorative artistic kettlebells on there.

2035
02:00:27.04 --> 02:00:30.04
That's where I get my a lot of good stuff on there.

2036
02:00:30.04 --> 02:00:31.04
On it.

2037
02:00:31.04 --> 02:00:32.04
Docom slash.

2038
02:00:32.04 --> 02:00:33.04
Jock.

2039
02:00:33.04 --> 02:00:34.04
Got a bunch of books.

2040
02:00:34.04 --> 02:00:37.04
There's a wall where there's a will that is live.

2041
02:00:37.04 --> 02:00:40.04
And it's actually available on Kindle right now.

2042
02:00:40.04 --> 02:00:42.04
We just released the Kindle version.

2043
02:00:42.04 --> 02:00:43.04
So apologize.

2044
02:00:43.04 --> 02:00:44.04
It took a little longer.

2045
02:00:44.04 --> 02:00:46.04
Way the warrior kid.

2046
02:00:46.04 --> 02:00:47.04
One.

2047
02:00:47.04 --> 02:00:48.04
And then way the warrior kid.

2048
02:00:48.04 --> 02:00:49.04
Two marks mission.

2049
02:00:49.04 --> 02:00:52.04
That is where you can get your kids on the path.

2050
02:00:52.04 --> 02:00:53.04
Mike in the dragons.

2051
02:00:53.04 --> 02:00:58.04
For anyone that needs to overcome fear.

2052
02:00:58.04 --> 02:00:59.04
Face fear.

2053
02:00:59.04 --> 02:01:00.04
Get Mikey in the dragons.

2054
02:01:00.04 --> 02:01:02.04
Displaning goes freedom field manual.

2055
02:01:02.04 --> 02:01:07.04
This is the adult version of how to get after it.

2056
02:01:07.04 --> 02:01:13.04
And then there's extreme ownership and the economy of leadership, which are books that I wrote with my brother,

2057
02:01:13.04 --> 02:01:15.04
Lave Babin.

2058
02:01:15.04 --> 02:01:22.04
They are the combat leadership lessons we learned and how you can apply them to your life and your business.

2059
02:01:22.04 --> 02:01:24.04
We got echelon front.

2060
02:01:24.04 --> 02:01:27.04
Which is where we solve problems through leadership.

2061
02:01:27.04 --> 02:01:28.04
Leadership consultancy.

2062
02:01:28.04 --> 02:01:32.04
If you want myself if you want Dave Burke if you want life.

2063
02:01:32.04 --> 02:01:33.04
Babin.

2064
02:01:33.04 --> 02:01:34.04
J.P.

2065
02:01:34.04 --> 02:01:35.04
Did Nell.

2066
02:01:35.04 --> 02:01:37.04
If you want Flynn, Cochran.

2067
02:01:37.04 --> 02:01:38.04
If you want Jason Gardner.

2068
02:01:38.04 --> 02:01:46.04
If you want Mike's to really to come to your location and help you align the leadership in your organization.

2069
02:01:46.04 --> 02:01:47.04
Who done this?

2070
02:01:47.04 --> 02:01:48.04
Mike Bima.

2071
02:01:48.04 --> 02:01:50.04
If you want anyone from National Unfront.

2072
02:01:50.04 --> 02:01:52.04
Go to www.slaunfront.com.

2073
02:01:52.04 --> 02:01:53.04
That's what we do.

2074
02:01:53.04 --> 02:01:54.04
We solve problems through leadership.

2075
02:01:54.04 --> 02:02:01.04
We got EF online, which is online, interactive training.

2076
02:02:01.04 --> 02:02:04.04
Because leadership training of any kind is not an occupation.

2077
02:02:04.04 --> 02:02:07.04
You need to get booster shots.

2078
02:02:07.04 --> 02:02:09.04
And that's what EF online is.

2079
02:02:09.04 --> 02:02:12.04
And it's something that you can put through your whole organization.

2080
02:02:12.04 --> 02:02:19.04
Get your whole organization from the frontline troops to the senior leadership on the same path with leadership.

2081
02:02:19.04 --> 02:02:21.04
EF online.com.

2082
02:02:21.04 --> 02:02:23.04
We got the master.

2083
02:02:23.04 --> 02:02:30.04
The master is coming up in September, 19th and 20th and Denver.

2084
02:02:30.04 --> 02:02:32.04
It's almost sold out.

2085
02:02:32.04 --> 02:02:36.04
So if you want to come, you better just register ASAP.

2086
02:02:36.04 --> 02:02:38.04
Sydney, Australia, and December, 4th and 5th.

2087
02:02:38.04 --> 02:02:40.04
Go to extremotownership.com.

2088
02:02:40.04 --> 02:02:42.04
Every one of them have sold out.

2089
02:02:42.04 --> 02:02:44.04
And those will sell out too.

2090
02:02:44.04 --> 02:02:52.04
And then of course, EF Overwatch, which we're taking combat leaders from special operations from combat aviation.

2091
02:02:52.04 --> 02:02:55.04
Guys like Dave Burke, good deal, Dave.

2092
02:02:55.04 --> 02:02:56.04
Yes.

2093
02:02:56.04 --> 02:02:59.04
Guys with that kind of experience.

2094
02:02:59.04 --> 02:03:13.04
And we are placing them into civilian companies where they are using their leadership that they've learned that they've been tested on and putting it to work in the civilian world.

2095
02:03:13.04 --> 02:03:21.04
Of course, you can't have Dave Burke because Dave Burke is with us on the team at echelon front.

2096
02:03:21.04 --> 02:03:23.04
And echelon, you can't anything else?

2097
02:03:23.04 --> 02:03:24.04
I don't.

2098
02:03:24.04 --> 02:03:29.04
But to see Dave Burke here, share time and space with them.

2099
02:03:29.04 --> 02:03:31.04
Other than that, not that.

2100
02:03:31.04 --> 02:03:32.04
Carry on.

2101
02:03:32.04 --> 02:03:33.04
Cheek Dave.

2102
02:03:33.04 --> 02:03:34.04
Nothing to add.

2103
02:03:34.04 --> 02:03:35.04
Cheek.

2104
02:03:35.04 --> 02:03:38.04
And if you do have something to add out there, that's fine.

2105
02:03:38.04 --> 02:03:41.04
There's still a chance you can find us on the In-Webs.

2106
02:03:41.04 --> 02:03:46.04
We are on Twitter, Instagram, and that's a frozen book.

2107
02:03:46.04 --> 02:03:52.04
Echoes at echelon Charles.

2108
02:03:52.04 --> 02:03:55.04
Dave is at Dave David R. Burke, B.E.R. K.E. and I am at Jockawilling.

2109
02:03:55.04 --> 02:04:12.04
And we have been getting granular with the Marine Corps right now, but we certainly honor all the branches of the military army Navy Air Force Marines Coast Guard, including active duty, reserveous guard units and all the vets.

2110
02:04:12.04 --> 02:04:27.04
Thanks to all of you for allowing us the freedom to record this podcast and to live the lives that we live into our police and law enforcement firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, board of patrol, secret service.

2111
02:04:27.04 --> 02:04:37.04
All the first responders out there, thanks to you all as well for being there for us when it counts.

2112
02:04:37.04 --> 02:04:52.04
When we need you to keep us safe, you are there standing by and we appreciate it. And to everyone else out there, remember what the Marine Corps says about discipline discipline is absolute.

2113
02:04:52.04 --> 02:04:56.04
There is no quasi discipline. There is no time off.

2114
02:04:56.04 --> 02:05:06.04
discipline is a way of thinking and more important than a way of thinking discipline is a way of behaving.

2115
02:05:06.04 --> 02:05:16.04
And there's about actions, not words, so don't allow any slack. Instead take charge, take action.

2116
02:05:16.04 --> 02:05:27.04
See the initiative and get after it. And until next time, this is Jaco and Echo and Dave out.
