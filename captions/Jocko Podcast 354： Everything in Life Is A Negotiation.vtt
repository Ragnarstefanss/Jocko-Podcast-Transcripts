00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.24
This is Jocko podcast number 354 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:04.24 --> 00:00:05.08
Jocko willing.

3
00:00:05.08 --> 00:00:05.92
Good evening Echo.

4
00:00:05.92 --> 00:00:06.76
Good evening.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.76
In August to 2000, the militant Islamic group Abu Sayyaf

6
00:00:12.76 --> 00:00:15.16
in the southern Philippines broadcast

7
00:00:15.16 --> 00:00:17.08
that had captured a CIA agent.

8
00:00:18.32 --> 00:00:20.76
The truth was not as newsworthy

9
00:00:20.76 --> 00:00:23.28
or as valuable to the rebels.

10
00:00:23.28 --> 00:00:26.64
Abu Sayyaf had kidnapped Jeffrey Shilling,

11
00:00:26.64 --> 00:00:29.40
a 24 year old American who had traveled

12
00:00:29.40 --> 00:00:32.08
near their base in Hollow Island.

13
00:00:32.08 --> 00:00:35.16
A California native, Shilling became a hostage

14
00:00:35.16 --> 00:00:39.20
with a $10 million price tag on his head.

15
00:00:39.20 --> 00:00:43.36
At the time, I was a supervisory special agent

16
00:00:43.36 --> 00:00:47.32
attached to the FBI's elite crisis negotiation unit,

17
00:00:47.32 --> 00:00:48.64
the CNU.

18
00:00:48.64 --> 00:00:50.60
The CNU is the equivalent

19
00:00:50.60 --> 00:00:53.68
of the special forces of negotiations.

20
00:00:53.68 --> 00:00:58.04
It's attached to the FBI's hostage rescue team, HRT.

21
00:00:58.04 --> 00:01:02.28
Both are national counter-terrorist response assets.

22
00:01:02.28 --> 00:01:04.60
They are the best of the best.

23
00:01:06.12 --> 00:01:08.64
I was a natural for the Shilling case.

24
00:01:08.64 --> 00:01:10.68
I had spent some time in the Philippines

25
00:01:10.68 --> 00:01:13.52
and had an extensive background in terrorism

26
00:01:13.52 --> 00:01:15.48
from my New York city days assigned

27
00:01:15.48 --> 00:01:19.24
to the Joint Terrorism Task Force, JTTF.

28
00:01:20.16 --> 00:01:22.76
A few days after Shilling became a hostage,

29
00:01:22.76 --> 00:01:25.94
my partner Chuck Regini and I flew to Manila

30
00:01:25.94 --> 00:01:28.02
to run the negotiations.

31
00:01:28.02 --> 00:01:29.36
Along with Jim Nixon,

32
00:01:29.36 --> 00:01:31.72
the FBI's highest official in Manila,

33
00:01:31.72 --> 00:01:35.88
we conferred with the top Philippine military brass.

34
00:01:35.88 --> 00:01:39.36
They agreed to let us guide the negotiations.

35
00:01:39.36 --> 00:01:41.28
Then we got down to business.

36
00:01:41.28 --> 00:01:44.000
One of us would take charge of the negotiation strategy

37
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.36
for the FBI and consequently for the US government.

38
00:01:48.22 --> 00:01:50.50
That became my role.

39
00:01:50.50 --> 00:01:52.44
With the support of my colleagues,

40
00:01:52.44 --> 00:01:54.60
my job was to come up with the strategy,

41
00:01:54.60 --> 00:01:58.12
get it approved and implement it.

42
00:01:58.12 --> 00:02:02.72
Our principal adversary was Abu Sabaya,

43
00:02:02.72 --> 00:02:05.48
the rebel leader who personally negotiated

44
00:02:05.48 --> 00:02:07.72
for Shilling's ransom.

45
00:02:07.72 --> 00:02:10.32
Sabaya was a veteran of the rebel movement

46
00:02:10.32 --> 00:02:11.76
with a violent past.

47
00:02:11.76 --> 00:02:14.40
He was straight out of the movies,

48
00:02:14.40 --> 00:02:17.76
a terrorist sociopath killer.

49
00:02:17.76 --> 00:02:22.36
He had a history of rape, murder, and beheadings.

50
00:02:22.36 --> 00:02:25.28
He liked to record his bloody deeds on video

51
00:02:25.28 --> 00:02:27.80
and then send them to the Philippine media.

52
00:02:28.88 --> 00:02:31.08
Sabaya always wore sunglasses,

53
00:02:31.08 --> 00:02:35.24
a bandana, a black t-shirt, and camo pants.

54
00:02:35.24 --> 00:02:37.52
He thought it made him a more dashing figure.

55
00:02:38.72 --> 00:02:41.52
If you look for any photos of Abu Saif terrorists

56
00:02:41.52 --> 00:02:44.96
from this period, you will always see one in sunglasses.

57
00:02:44.96 --> 00:02:46.56
That's Sabaya.

58
00:02:46.56 --> 00:02:50.04
Sabaya loved, loved, loved the media.

59
00:02:50.04 --> 00:02:54.44
He had the Philippine reporters on speed dial.

60
00:02:54.44 --> 00:02:57.80
They'd call him and ask him questions in Tagalog,

61
00:02:57.80 --> 00:02:59.68
his native tongue.

62
00:02:59.68 --> 00:03:00.96
He would answer in English

63
00:03:00.96 --> 00:03:04.06
because he wanted the world to hear his voice on CNN.

64
00:03:05.08 --> 00:03:08.56
They should make a movie about me, he would tell reporters.

65
00:03:09.88 --> 00:03:13.32
In my eyes, Sabaya was a cold-blooded businessman

66
00:03:13.32 --> 00:03:17.64
with an ego as big as Texas, a real shark.

67
00:03:17.64 --> 00:03:21.16
Sabaya knew he was in the commodities game.

68
00:03:22.16 --> 00:03:25.48
In Jeffrey Shilling, he had an item of value.

69
00:03:26.44 --> 00:03:27.88
How much could he get for it?

70
00:03:28.92 --> 00:03:31.88
He would find out and I intended it to be a surprise

71
00:03:31.88 --> 00:03:33.52
he wouldn't like.

72
00:03:33.52 --> 00:03:36.92
As an FBI agent, I wanted to free the hostage

73
00:03:36.92 --> 00:03:38.98
and bring the criminal to justice.

74
00:03:40.36 --> 00:03:42.80
As a result of the Shilling case,

75
00:03:42.80 --> 00:03:47.60
I would become the FBI's lead international kidnapping

76
00:03:47.60 --> 00:03:48.62
negotiator.

77
00:03:52.80 --> 00:03:57.24
On that right there is an excerpt from a book.

78
00:03:57.24 --> 00:04:00.20
The book is called Never Split the Difference,

79
00:04:00.20 --> 00:04:03.68
which is written by a man named Chris Voss.

80
00:04:03.68 --> 00:04:07.60
Chris Voss spent 24 years with the FBI,

81
00:04:07.60 --> 00:04:10.36
where he spent time as the lead crisis negotiator

82
00:04:10.36 --> 00:04:12.72
for the New York City division of the FBI,

83
00:04:12.72 --> 00:04:16.48
was also the lead international kidnapping negotiator.

84
00:04:16.48 --> 00:04:20.56
He was trained as a negotiator not only by the FBI,

85
00:04:20.56 --> 00:04:24.08
but also by Harvard Law School and Scotland Yard,

86
00:04:24.08 --> 00:04:27.66
which is London's metropolitan police.

87
00:04:28.72 --> 00:04:32.60
He worked the 1993 World Trade Center bombing,

88
00:04:32.60 --> 00:04:36.000
the TWA Flight 800 explosion,

89
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
the kidnapping of Jill Carroll in Iraq in 2006,

90
00:04:41.78 --> 00:04:45.36
as well as countless other dynamic situations

91
00:04:45.36 --> 00:04:49.64
around the world and incredible experiences.

92
00:04:50.44 --> 00:04:54.20
And it's a privilege tonight to have Chris Voss with us here

93
00:04:54.20 --> 00:04:58.60
to discuss what he's been through and what he's learned.

94
00:04:58.60 --> 00:05:00.76
Chris, thanks for joining us.

95
00:05:00.76 --> 00:05:02.40
Thanks man, happy to be here.

96
00:05:02.40 --> 00:05:03.36
Yeah, it's a...

97
00:05:03.36 --> 00:05:06.08
By the way, if I ever have anybody else read my book,

98
00:05:06.08 --> 00:05:07.40
I'll have you do the reading.

99
00:05:08.64 --> 00:05:10.000
Let me know, let me know.

100
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.16
I'm here to help out.

101
00:05:12.16 --> 00:05:13.28
Yeah, fantastic book.

102
00:05:13.28 --> 00:05:16.28
Yeah, if people, if you don't have this yet,

103
00:05:16.28 --> 00:05:18.20
it's never split the difference.

104
00:05:18.20 --> 00:05:23.12
The subtitle is Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It.

105
00:05:23.12 --> 00:05:25.40
So, fantastic book.

106
00:05:25.40 --> 00:05:28.40
And we actually tried to do this before COVID,

107
00:05:28.40 --> 00:05:31.68
or maybe right before COVID, but it didn't work out.

108
00:05:31.68 --> 00:05:33.96
And so, glad you could finally get out here

109
00:05:33.96 --> 00:05:36.72
and definitely looking forward to this conversation.

110
00:05:38.88 --> 00:05:41.36
Before we jump into the book and all your lessons,

111
00:05:41.36 --> 00:05:43.56
let's get a little bit of background on you

112
00:05:43.56 --> 00:05:45.76
and how you ended up here today.

113
00:05:45.76 --> 00:05:47.64
So, where'd you grow up?

114
00:05:47.64 --> 00:05:48.48
Where'd you come from?

115
00:05:48.48 --> 00:05:49.68
Small town in Iowa.

116
00:05:51.52 --> 00:05:54.48
Son of Richard and Joyce Voss,

117
00:05:54.48 --> 00:05:56.36
my dad was a blue collar entrepreneur

118
00:05:56.36 --> 00:05:57.96
owned his own business.

119
00:05:57.96 --> 00:06:01.28
My mom was initially a stay-at-home mom.

120
00:06:01.28 --> 00:06:02.80
That's what they were back in those days.

121
00:06:02.80 --> 00:06:05.72
And then ultimately, as a kid grew up,

122
00:06:05.72 --> 00:06:08.64
got involved in my father's, aspects of my father's business.

123
00:06:08.64 --> 00:06:10.44
What was the dad's business?

124
00:06:10.44 --> 00:06:12.64
Oil job originally,

125
00:06:12.64 --> 00:06:16.52
a middleman between Shell Oil and the end user,

126
00:06:16.52 --> 00:06:21.52
which would usually be large farms, small companies.

127
00:06:22.08 --> 00:06:24.88
And then really the business, when he bought it,

128
00:06:24.88 --> 00:06:26.20
was home heating oil.

129
00:06:27.08 --> 00:06:30.000
And I can remember my father going out in the middle of the

130
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.32
night in the middle of winter,

131
00:06:31.32 --> 00:06:32.68
because somebody's furnace shut down.

132
00:06:32.68 --> 00:06:34.92
He had to fix it, they're gonna freeze.

133
00:06:34.92 --> 00:06:37.92
And then after he got into the business,

134
00:06:37.92 --> 00:06:41.60
according to him, not independently verified,

135
00:06:41.60 --> 00:06:44.12
but it certainly was a case.

136
00:06:44.12 --> 00:06:45.80
Gas company came in and gave everybody,

137
00:06:45.80 --> 00:06:50.80
it had fuel oil furnaces, free natural gas services furnaces.

138
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.60
Took away all those customers.

139
00:06:53.60 --> 00:06:57.36
By the time that I graduated high school,

140
00:06:57.36 --> 00:06:59.88
we were one of the only houses that I knew

141
00:06:59.88 --> 00:07:03.28
that was still burning fuel oil for heat.

142
00:07:04.84 --> 00:07:06.92
But he adapted, you know, you gotta adapt.

143
00:07:06.92 --> 00:07:11.92
He expanded his business, bought some gas stations,

144
00:07:12.08 --> 00:07:14.56
built some convenience stores,

145
00:07:14.56 --> 00:07:17.24
saw himself as much in the energy business

146
00:07:17.24 --> 00:07:19.68
as a fuel oil business and just adapted.

147
00:07:19.68 --> 00:07:21.12
And so what were you doing growing up?

148
00:07:21.12 --> 00:07:23.16
Were you playing sports in school?

149
00:07:23.16 --> 00:07:24.000
Do you like school?

150
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
What was the deal there?

151
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.20
Yeah, well, I played football and basketball.

152
00:07:27.20 --> 00:07:29.52
And if I wanted to run track, I was allowed.

153
00:07:29.52 --> 00:07:31.72
There were certain things that wasn't allowed to do.

154
00:07:31.72 --> 00:07:36.04
Like, well, one year I wanna play golf, you know,

155
00:07:36.04 --> 00:07:38.04
every high school's got a golf team.

156
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.28
And the old man just wasn't happy.

157
00:07:41.28 --> 00:07:46.28
He wasn't seeing that as legitimate sporting activity

158
00:07:46.32 --> 00:07:48.88
that could divert me away from working for him.

159
00:07:49.92 --> 00:07:52.80
So, you know, I had to, my father believed,

160
00:07:52.80 --> 00:07:57.20
he put a roof over your head, he fed you, he clothed you.

161
00:07:57.20 --> 00:07:58.80
You were gonna go to work.

162
00:07:58.80 --> 00:08:01.40
He got paid, but yeah, you're going to work.

163
00:08:01.40 --> 00:08:04.16
So what were you working at the gas stations and whatnot?

164
00:08:04.16 --> 00:08:08.24
Mostly, the only time I ever worked at a gas station,

165
00:08:08.24 --> 00:08:10.000
it was for one that he didn't own,

166
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.40
and it was a business associate wanted to hire me on.

167
00:08:12.40 --> 00:08:15.84
But most of the time it was, whatever needed to be done,

168
00:08:15.84 --> 00:08:18.16
maintenance, driving trucks, driving tractors,

169
00:08:18.16 --> 00:08:20.52
cutting grass, painting.

170
00:08:20.52 --> 00:08:23.84
Like, I painted a lot of stuff in the summertime.

171
00:08:23.84 --> 00:08:25.24
To this day, I hate to paint.

172
00:08:25.24 --> 00:08:30.24
You know, he needed a house painted, he had kids.

173
00:08:30.36 --> 00:08:32.60
Here's a bucket of paint, here's a brush,

174
00:08:32.60 --> 00:08:34.20
here's a scaffold, paint down.

175
00:08:34.20 --> 00:08:35.32
Get busy.

176
00:08:35.32 --> 00:08:40.32
Well, my favorite one was, he wanted a new garage.

177
00:08:40.52 --> 00:08:42.64
Wanted to build, you know, the house we bought,

178
00:08:42.64 --> 00:08:46.04
had a single car garage, you barely fit that one in,

179
00:08:46.04 --> 00:08:47.48
he wants a new garage.

180
00:08:47.48 --> 00:08:49.60
I'm probably about 11 or 12 at the time,

181
00:08:49.60 --> 00:08:52.28
my older sister's 13 or 14.

182
00:08:53.16 --> 00:08:54.60
He hands us crowbars and says,

183
00:08:54.60 --> 00:08:56.76
go out in the backyard, tear down a garage.

184
00:08:57.76 --> 00:09:01.36
And then, so we pretty much tear the whole thing down,

185
00:09:01.36 --> 00:09:03.60
and then we got the foundation left.

186
00:09:03.60 --> 00:09:06.08
And you gotta knock the foundation out,

187
00:09:06.08 --> 00:09:08.72
and the old man thinks, all right,

188
00:09:08.72 --> 00:09:10.16
well I'll go run a jackhammer.

189
00:09:10.16 --> 00:09:14.84
I'll put my 12 year old on a jackhammer on a foundation.

190
00:09:14.84 --> 00:09:18.000
And I don't know, I'm like, all right, dad, you know.

191
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.84
And the foundation was so big,

192
00:09:19.84 --> 00:09:22.16
I couldn't break it up with a jackhammer,

193
00:09:22.16 --> 00:09:24.28
so he finally has to hire a contractor,

194
00:09:24.28 --> 00:09:26.44
and this guy comes in with a backhoe.

195
00:09:26.44 --> 00:09:30.88
And I'm thinking, an adult man needs a backhoe

196
00:09:30.88 --> 00:09:32.44
to take this out, and I'm out here

197
00:09:32.44 --> 00:09:35.16
with a hammer and nails on a jackhammer, and I'm 12.

198
00:09:36.24 --> 00:09:37.84
Jack.

199
00:09:37.84 --> 00:09:41.52
So you're doing good in school?

200
00:09:41.52 --> 00:09:42.36
Fair.

201
00:09:43.32 --> 00:09:45.92
I was capable of better grades than I felt like getting.

202
00:09:47.68 --> 00:09:49.80
Mostly a B student.

203
00:09:49.80 --> 00:09:52.16
Did you have interest in going to college?

204
00:09:52.16 --> 00:09:54.40
What was your future looking like

205
00:09:54.40 --> 00:09:56.36
when you were like 16 years old?

206
00:09:56.36 --> 00:09:59.08
College was always part of the game plan.

207
00:09:59.08 --> 00:10:01.16
For whatever reason, it was always accepted

208
00:10:01.16 --> 00:10:04.88
that all of us, older sister and two younger,

209
00:10:04.88 --> 00:10:06.28
accepted we were gonna go to college.

210
00:10:06.28 --> 00:10:09.52
Your man was gonna spring for four years of tuition.

211
00:10:10.40 --> 00:10:12.96
If you graduated or not, that was on you.

212
00:10:12.96 --> 00:10:16.000
Finite amount of money, got a certain amount of money,

213
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.08
put in my checking account, star of every session.

214
00:10:19.08 --> 00:10:21.000
I spent it or not, it was up to me.

215
00:10:22.80 --> 00:10:26.88
And I just, and then whatever happened

216
00:10:26.88 --> 00:10:29.12
after that was pretty much up to us.

217
00:10:29.12 --> 00:10:31.20
And so where'd you end up going to college?

218
00:10:31.20 --> 00:10:33.60
I was State University.

219
00:10:33.60 --> 00:10:36.96
My older sister went there one reason ago.

220
00:10:38.24 --> 00:10:40.32
You know, I really idolized her growing up,

221
00:10:40.32 --> 00:10:42.48
and she was there sort of plowing the ground.

222
00:10:42.48 --> 00:10:44.96
It was far enough away from home

223
00:10:44.96 --> 00:10:47.24
that I wouldn't have to work in the evenings,

224
00:10:47.24 --> 00:10:49.40
or be expected to work on the weekends.

225
00:10:50.48 --> 00:10:51.32
You know, because it was a trick.

226
00:10:51.32 --> 00:10:52.92
She had to get out of that work radius.

227
00:10:52.92 --> 00:10:54.000
Had to get out of work radius.

228
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.08
Three and a half hour drive, on a whim,

229
00:10:57.08 --> 00:10:59.28
he can't call me back at four,

230
00:10:59.28 --> 00:11:01.84
because he needs something done at five.

231
00:11:01.84 --> 00:11:03.56
But it was also close enough to get back

232
00:11:03.56 --> 00:11:06.12
on a weekend if I needed to, for whatever reason.

233
00:11:06.12 --> 00:11:08.56
And no wrestling for you growing up in Iowa?

234
00:11:08.56 --> 00:11:10.48
Ah, good observation.

235
00:11:10.48 --> 00:11:12.52
Nah, I wasn't into wrestling.

236
00:11:12.52 --> 00:11:14.28
Home of a lot of great wrestling.

237
00:11:14.28 --> 00:11:16.48
They gave a little bunch of folks.

238
00:11:16.48 --> 00:11:19.000
Iowa State Cyclones were running championship

239
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.88
after championship in those days.

240
00:11:20.88 --> 00:11:25.88
The 190 pound wrestler Frank Santana, I remember him.

241
00:11:26.72 --> 00:11:29.08
But no, I was a basketball player.

242
00:11:29.08 --> 00:11:30.28
I wasn't a grand player.

243
00:11:30.28 --> 00:11:31.92
Those seasons clash.

244
00:11:31.92 --> 00:11:35.60
Now at what point did you start looking at law enforcement?

245
00:11:35.60 --> 00:11:39.24
Actually, when I was 16, a buddy of mine and I went

246
00:11:39.24 --> 00:11:44.24
and saw, based on a true story, true life movie,

247
00:11:44.28 --> 00:11:47.32
The Super Cops, two cops in New York.

248
00:11:47.32 --> 00:11:50.96
Somebody recently actually found me a DVD event

249
00:11:50.96 --> 00:11:51.80
sent it to me.

250
00:11:53.88 --> 00:11:56.04
These guys worked in bed style,

251
00:11:56.04 --> 00:11:58.36
back when bed style was a really bad area.

252
00:11:59.48 --> 00:12:04.16
White dudes, very black area, community loved them.

253
00:12:04.16 --> 00:12:05.000
Love them.

254
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.72
These guys locked up bad people and the good people

255
00:12:08.72 --> 00:12:11.04
in the community appreciated the heck out of it.

256
00:12:11.04 --> 00:12:13.24
And these guys were extremely creative.

257
00:12:13.24 --> 00:12:14.44
I didn't realize that at the time.

258
00:12:14.44 --> 00:12:16.68
The other thing that really attracted me

259
00:12:16.68 --> 00:12:18.28
to them, complete mavericks.

260
00:12:18.28 --> 00:12:21.24
Like didn't pay attention to what the bosses told them.

261
00:12:21.24 --> 00:12:22.88
And put a lot of bad people in jail.

262
00:12:22.88 --> 00:12:25.60
We're very, very creative about it.

263
00:12:25.60 --> 00:12:30.60
And the community actually nicknamed them Batman and Robin.

264
00:12:33.20 --> 00:12:34.60
That's awesome, except for the dude

265
00:12:34.60 --> 00:12:36.40
that got stuck being Robin.

266
00:12:36.40 --> 00:12:39.08
Yeah, who wants to be Robin, right?

267
00:12:39.08 --> 00:12:42.72
But then me and my buddy saw this when I remember we were 16

268
00:12:42.72 --> 00:12:44.68
and we both got struck at that moment in time.

269
00:12:44.68 --> 00:12:46.76
We wanted to be in law enforcement.

270
00:12:46.76 --> 00:12:50.36
And I stayed in law enforcement as occasionally

271
00:12:50.36 --> 00:12:51.84
a harsh reality.

272
00:12:52.84 --> 00:12:55.72
And my buddy went to Phoenix,

273
00:12:55.72 --> 00:12:57.16
got on with police department there.

274
00:12:57.16 --> 00:12:59.76
And the harshness of it,

275
00:12:59.76 --> 00:13:02.72
he just wasn't built for it, need and last.

276
00:13:02.72 --> 00:13:04.32
This was the guy that saw the movie with you?

277
00:13:04.32 --> 00:13:05.16
Yeah.

278
00:13:05.16 --> 00:13:06.72
What did you study in college?

279
00:13:07.96 --> 00:13:09.76
Ultimately it was a business degree.

280
00:13:11.04 --> 00:13:12.32
They didn't call it that back then.

281
00:13:12.32 --> 00:13:14.52
They would call it industrial administration.

282
00:13:14.52 --> 00:13:16.60
But it was a business degree.

283
00:13:16.60 --> 00:13:19.04
And I started out originally,

284
00:13:20.08 --> 00:13:22.56
you know, I got in the engineering school.

285
00:13:22.56 --> 00:13:24.76
I switched out as soon as I was there.

286
00:13:24.76 --> 00:13:27.12
Switched to sociology.

287
00:13:27.12 --> 00:13:30.12
But then I realized that a lot of sociologists out of work,

288
00:13:30.12 --> 00:13:33.000
what if I changed my mind about being a cop?

289
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.60
So I decided to go to business just to have the flexibility

290
00:13:36.60 --> 00:13:39.32
of going whatever direction I wanted to go.

291
00:13:39.32 --> 00:13:40.96
So you graduate in four years?

292
00:13:40.96 --> 00:13:42.32
Four, you got out in four years.

293
00:13:42.32 --> 00:13:46.32
And then was it straight to the police academy somewhere?

294
00:13:46.32 --> 00:13:48.80
Yeah, I went, well, initially,

295
00:13:48.80 --> 00:13:51.32
I wanted to go to Kansas City, Missouri.

296
00:13:51.32 --> 00:13:53.72
I had never been there.

297
00:13:53.72 --> 00:13:55.92
But everybody in that part of the world,

298
00:13:55.92 --> 00:13:58.16
the three cities for choices were principally,

299
00:13:58.16 --> 00:14:00.88
Kansas City, St. Louis and Chicago.

300
00:14:00.88 --> 00:14:04.68
Now originally, I had my heart set on San Francisco.

301
00:14:05.96 --> 00:14:07.44
And because we had visited there,

302
00:14:07.44 --> 00:14:10.000
my family went there when I was about 18.

303
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.28
I thought, this is a cool town.

304
00:14:11.28 --> 00:14:13.000
It's a really interesting place.

305
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.60
And then a thing called Proposition 13 came through

306
00:14:15.60 --> 00:14:21.16
in California where they cut back on all the property taxes.

307
00:14:21.16 --> 00:14:22.48
I figured they were gonna impact

308
00:14:22.48 --> 00:14:25.04
the municipal budgets negatively.

309
00:14:25.04 --> 00:14:26.40
Probably a guy from out of state

310
00:14:26.40 --> 00:14:28.60
was gonna have trouble getting hired.

311
00:14:28.60 --> 00:14:31.16
So then I just decided to stay local.

312
00:14:31.16 --> 00:14:33.96
And everybody that I knew that had been to Kansas City

313
00:14:33.96 --> 00:14:36.68
said this is a great town.

314
00:14:36.68 --> 00:14:40.32
And so I just went out and applied completely out of the blue.

315
00:14:40.32 --> 00:14:44.36
They told me they were not hiring when I graduated.

316
00:14:44.36 --> 00:14:46.88
Remember when I graduated, I was really depressed

317
00:14:46.88 --> 00:14:48.12
because I didn't know where I was gonna go.

318
00:14:48.12 --> 00:14:51.32
Didn't wanna go back home and work for my father.

319
00:14:51.32 --> 00:14:53.48
But I had nowhere else to go.

320
00:14:53.48 --> 00:14:58.04
And Kansas City, although they knew internally

321
00:14:58.04 --> 00:15:01.24
that June 1, it was gonna be a new fiscal year

322
00:15:01.24 --> 00:15:04.16
and a new world, they were telling me at the time,

323
00:15:04.16 --> 00:15:05.92
now we got no idea when we're gonna hire.

324
00:15:05.92 --> 00:15:07.28
Just no idea.

325
00:15:07.28 --> 00:15:08.72
This is me.

326
00:15:08.72 --> 00:15:11.64
So they had to have known they were gonna hire you.

327
00:15:11.64 --> 00:15:13.16
And a new fiscal year came in,

328
00:15:13.16 --> 00:15:15.36
they started a new class, I was in a class.

329
00:15:16.36 --> 00:15:17.52
How'd they notify you?

330
00:15:18.64 --> 00:15:19.88
Oh, interesting.

331
00:15:19.88 --> 00:15:20.80
I may have gotten a letter.

332
00:15:20.80 --> 00:15:22.60
I don't even actually remember.

333
00:15:23.80 --> 00:15:25.40
So you didn't think you had a job,

334
00:15:25.40 --> 00:15:26.40
then all of a sudden you got a job?

335
00:15:26.40 --> 00:15:27.32
Suddenly I had a job.

336
00:15:27.32 --> 00:15:30.64
And then in the meantime, I'm back working for my dad,

337
00:15:30.64 --> 00:15:31.48
driving a truck.

338
00:15:31.48 --> 00:15:34.56
Your dad's like, your life plotted out for you.

339
00:15:34.56 --> 00:15:36.16
Like you're fine, kid.

340
00:15:36.16 --> 00:15:40.92
And also, like just to get into law enforcement,

341
00:15:40.92 --> 00:15:44.12
I remember I applied for Sheriff's Department,

342
00:15:44.12 --> 00:15:48.32
got turned down, and then I had done an internship

343
00:15:48.32 --> 00:15:50.52
with the Highway Department of Public Safety.

344
00:15:51.52 --> 00:15:55.84
And I can't remember exactly why.

345
00:15:55.84 --> 00:15:57.92
I don't think I wanted to be in Iowa.

346
00:15:57.92 --> 00:16:00.000
I didn't wanna be in Iowa Highway Patrol.

347
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.28
If I was gonna be uniform, I wanna be in a city.

348
00:16:03.28 --> 00:16:06.52
And I remember being told from complete people

349
00:16:06.52 --> 00:16:08.60
in the Department of Public Safety,

350
00:16:08.60 --> 00:16:11.000
like you could walk right into the Highway Patrol

351
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
because I'd had an internship with them the year before.

352
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.12
So they knew me, they knew I was an honest guy.

353
00:16:16.12 --> 00:16:19.60
And that however innovative I was,

354
00:16:19.60 --> 00:16:22.02
I also really wasn't a rule breaker.

355
00:16:22.96 --> 00:16:25.52
You know, I was gonna follow the rules.

356
00:16:25.52 --> 00:16:28.08
But I didn't wanna be a Highway Patrolman.

357
00:16:28.08 --> 00:16:29.72
So I held up for Kansas City,

358
00:16:29.72 --> 00:16:31.52
wanna be in a city and got in there.

359
00:16:31.52 --> 00:16:33.32
So you end up at Kansas City,

360
00:16:33.32 --> 00:16:37.64
how's that like going to the police academy?

361
00:16:37.64 --> 00:16:39.60
Is that a boot camp scenario?

362
00:16:39.60 --> 00:16:41.44
Is it a gentleman's course?

363
00:16:41.44 --> 00:16:43.36
Is it you go home in the afternoon?

364
00:16:43.36 --> 00:16:44.40
Are you staying in barracks?

365
00:16:44.40 --> 00:16:45.24
How does that all work?

366
00:16:45.24 --> 00:16:47.92
Yeah, they had just moved the police academy

367
00:16:47.92 --> 00:16:49.64
into a local community college,

368
00:16:49.64 --> 00:16:51.80
I think for budgetary reasons.

369
00:16:51.80 --> 00:16:56.80
They had their own academy in its own standalone campus

370
00:16:56.80 --> 00:17:00.08
where they controlled all aspects of it.

371
00:17:00.08 --> 00:17:03.68
And for whatever reason, which I'm sure is budgetary,

372
00:17:03.68 --> 00:17:04.64
they abandoned that.

373
00:17:04.64 --> 00:17:06.24
So we're in a community college,

374
00:17:07.84 --> 00:17:10.76
combination of classroom, not quite boot camp,

375
00:17:10.76 --> 00:17:13.88
plus you're going home to your own apartment every night.

376
00:17:13.88 --> 00:17:18.88
They six months PT every day.

377
00:17:20.48 --> 00:17:23.16
And something that I think law enforcement

378
00:17:23.16 --> 00:17:24.84
is really a lost site of,

379
00:17:24.84 --> 00:17:27.28
like the neck restraint, the carotid restraint.

380
00:17:27.28 --> 00:17:32.28
We worked on that every single day for six months.

381
00:17:34.92 --> 00:17:38.08
Like nobody that I ever worked with

382
00:17:38.08 --> 00:17:42.28
ever heard anybody by misapplication of the neck restraint.

383
00:17:42.28 --> 00:17:45.40
And they knew that it was potentially lethal.

384
00:17:45.40 --> 00:17:46.84
And if there was one thing they were going to do,

385
00:17:46.84 --> 00:17:49.88
we're going to be in condition relatively speaking,

386
00:17:49.88 --> 00:17:52.40
not sealed condition, but in condition.

387
00:17:52.40 --> 00:17:53.84
But we weren't going to hurt anybody

388
00:17:53.84 --> 00:17:55.68
putting the neck restraint on them.

389
00:17:55.68 --> 00:17:57.72
We worked on that every day for six months.

390
00:17:57.72 --> 00:18:01.24
Yeah, it's just a horrible thing to see happening right now

391
00:18:01.24 --> 00:18:02.08
with law enforcement.

392
00:18:02.08 --> 00:18:03.60
I mean, I talked to a lot of police officers

393
00:18:03.60 --> 00:18:07.88
around the country and in most places right now,

394
00:18:07.88 --> 00:18:10.16
you cannot use a neck restraint.

395
00:18:10.16 --> 00:18:13.48
It's considered lethal force and you cannot use it.

396
00:18:14.72 --> 00:18:17.68
And as anybody that knows anything,

397
00:18:17.68 --> 00:18:21.20
it is absolutely the best way to get someone

398
00:18:21.20 --> 00:18:23.72
under control that's out of control without hurting them.

399
00:18:23.72 --> 00:18:28.72
And if somebody had to restrain my wife or my daughter,

400
00:18:29.24 --> 00:18:32.20
I would beg that they please use a neck restraint

401
00:18:32.20 --> 00:18:34.32
because they'll be fine.

402
00:18:35.40 --> 00:18:39.32
So it's great to hear that at some point in time,

403
00:18:39.32 --> 00:18:41.84
you were trained in that way and you did it every day.

404
00:18:41.84 --> 00:18:43.64
So you learn how effective it is.

405
00:18:43.64 --> 00:18:46.36
You also learn what to be careful of.

406
00:18:48.28 --> 00:18:49.96
That makes sense.

407
00:18:49.96 --> 00:18:54.88
Like one cop and I, we had to corral this gorilla

408
00:18:54.88 --> 00:18:58.44
and just, you know, Caucasian just for the record.

409
00:18:58.44 --> 00:19:02.44
But this monstrous dude at the mental hospital,

410
00:19:04.48 --> 00:19:08.40
which means like normally somebody is nuts and big as that

411
00:19:08.40 --> 00:19:11.08
once you corral him, you take him to the mental hospital.

412
00:19:11.08 --> 00:19:12.56
So when the mental hospital calls you

413
00:19:12.56 --> 00:19:15.56
to get somebody out of there, you know, you got a problem.

414
00:19:15.56 --> 00:19:17.98
If we wouldn't have been able to choke that guy out

415
00:19:17.98 --> 00:19:20.36
with the proper carotid restraint,

416
00:19:20.36 --> 00:19:21.76
I don't know how we'd have got him out of there

417
00:19:21.76 --> 00:19:23.000
without shooting him.

418
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.60
Like, and we got him out of there completely unhooked.

419
00:19:25.60 --> 00:19:26.60
Yeah, yeah.

420
00:19:28.04 --> 00:19:33.04
That's a horrible escalation to go from,

421
00:19:33.04 --> 00:19:36.24
oh, this guy's a problem and now I have to shoot him

422
00:19:36.24 --> 00:19:37.28
because I don't know what else to do

423
00:19:37.28 --> 00:19:39.000
or I'm not allowed to do anything else.

424
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.04
That escalation from this guy's gonna be perfect,

425
00:19:41.04 --> 00:19:44.52
literally perfectly fine to now he's dead

426
00:19:44.52 --> 00:19:47.08
because I didn't have, I wasn't authorized to use the tools

427
00:19:47.08 --> 00:19:48.48
that I should be authorized to use

428
00:19:48.48 --> 00:19:51.24
and should be trained properly.

429
00:19:51.24 --> 00:19:52.64
That's awful.

430
00:19:52.64 --> 00:19:54.64
So it's a six month school.

431
00:19:54.64 --> 00:19:58.08
Six month Academy in a community college

432
00:19:59.32 --> 00:20:03.44
trying to maintain quasi military discipline,

433
00:20:03.44 --> 00:20:06.20
which most law enforcement kind of quasi.

434
00:20:06.20 --> 00:20:08.68
And it was, yeah, it was good classroom,

435
00:20:08.68 --> 00:20:11.48
working out occasionally a couple of times a week

436
00:20:11.48 --> 00:20:12.48
going through the range.

437
00:20:12.48 --> 00:20:17.24
And like when you're saying classroom,

438
00:20:17.24 --> 00:20:19.04
is this like four or five hours of classroom a day?

439
00:20:19.04 --> 00:20:20.04
You learned about the laws,

440
00:20:20.04 --> 00:20:22.12
you learned about what you can and cannot do?

441
00:20:22.12 --> 00:20:23.56
Yeah, all that kind of stuff.

442
00:20:24.72 --> 00:20:27.76
Combination, constitutional law,

443
00:20:28.62 --> 00:20:31.38
some un-understandable probable cause,

444
00:20:32.64 --> 00:20:35.92
administrative rules and regulations

445
00:20:35.92 --> 00:20:39.40
that we're gonna have to know just to get by on the street.

446
00:20:39.40 --> 00:20:41.20
You know, I can remember the first time

447
00:20:41.20 --> 00:20:45.52
the standard report form was a form 189.

448
00:20:45.52 --> 00:20:47.000
And so they say,

449
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.84
we're gonna learn how to fill out a form 189.

450
00:20:49.84 --> 00:20:52.52
I remember thinking like, I can remember 189 forms.

451
00:20:52.52 --> 00:20:57.52
I was relieved that I didn't have to memorize 189 forms.

452
00:20:59.44 --> 00:21:01.28
So did you feel pretty good?

453
00:21:01.28 --> 00:21:03.84
Did you feel pretty prepared when you ended up,

454
00:21:03.84 --> 00:21:06.20
you know, you get your badge, you go to the street?

455
00:21:06.20 --> 00:21:08.40
How did you feel like you were pretty prepared for it?

456
00:21:08.40 --> 00:21:12.46
Well, I felt like I was, certainly did.

457
00:21:13.48 --> 00:21:16.84
There were a couple things that took getting used to like,

458
00:21:16.84 --> 00:21:18.52
initially I was so nervous,

459
00:21:18.52 --> 00:21:21.56
my break-in officer was scared to let me drive.

460
00:21:21.56 --> 00:21:26.08
And then, you know, the complexity of being on patrol,

461
00:21:26.08 --> 00:21:30.68
listening to the radio, and actually being on patrol.

462
00:21:30.68 --> 00:21:33.76
Most, initially you can't do both.

463
00:21:33.76 --> 00:21:35.84
So if you're really paying attention to your environment,

464
00:21:35.84 --> 00:21:38.000
if you're looking around, if you're listening,

465
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.92
you're not gonna hear the radio.

466
00:21:39.92 --> 00:21:42.64
And finally somebody's gonna come by and say,

467
00:21:42.64 --> 00:21:45.40
we've been calling you for 20 minutes.

468
00:21:45.40 --> 00:21:48.48
But then, and then you just keep doing it every day,

469
00:21:48.48 --> 00:21:51.12
every day, every day, and then suddenly something clicks

470
00:21:51.12 --> 00:21:52.96
and you're pulling in all the information

471
00:21:52.96 --> 00:21:54.42
and you're dialing.

472
00:21:54.42 --> 00:21:55.80
So you have a break-in officer,

473
00:21:55.80 --> 00:21:57.08
is that the term you used?

474
00:21:57.08 --> 00:21:58.84
Yeah, yeah, for two months,

475
00:22:00.60 --> 00:22:03.36
they, you know, they wanna see,

476
00:22:03.36 --> 00:22:04.76
but they're not, they're gonna turn you loose.

477
00:22:04.76 --> 00:22:08.96
Kansas City at the time ran one-man car patrols.

478
00:22:08.96 --> 00:22:11.08
So when you got cut loose off break-in,

479
00:22:11.08 --> 00:22:13.000
you were riding around by yourself.

480
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.72
Which is, for a variety of reasons,

481
00:22:15.72 --> 00:22:17.20
actually I'm hearing now,

482
00:22:17.20 --> 00:22:19.64
really a good patrol strategy.

483
00:22:19.64 --> 00:22:20.72
Why is that?

484
00:22:20.72 --> 00:22:22.92
What I just heard recently,

485
00:22:22.92 --> 00:22:24.16
unsourced,

486
00:22:25.88 --> 00:22:30.88
that a male police officer is less likely

487
00:22:32.32 --> 00:22:34.40
to overreact to a challenge

488
00:22:34.40 --> 00:22:36.72
if he's by himself.

489
00:22:36.72 --> 00:22:39.48
And if there's two males there,

490
00:22:39.48 --> 00:22:43.76
two male police officers at the initial challenge,

491
00:22:43.76 --> 00:22:46.16
you're a little more likely to overreact

492
00:22:46.16 --> 00:22:47.60
because there's another male there

493
00:22:47.60 --> 00:22:50.52
that you're afraid of losing face in front of.

494
00:22:50.52 --> 00:22:52.16
I don't know how true that is.

495
00:22:53.16 --> 00:22:55.28
It makes sense to me for a variety of reasons.

496
00:22:55.28 --> 00:22:57.32
There's some more complexity to it.

497
00:22:58.20 --> 00:23:01.32
You know, I held off before talking to you

498
00:23:01.32 --> 00:23:03.96
about the different people you've had on.

499
00:23:03.96 --> 00:23:06.92
Huberman, a huge Andrew Huberman fan.

500
00:23:06.92 --> 00:23:08.96
And I saw you had him in.

501
00:23:08.96 --> 00:23:10.88
I think he's brilliant, he's brilliant, dude.

502
00:23:10.88 --> 00:23:15.84
I had the good fortune to have lunch with him one day.

503
00:23:15.84 --> 00:23:20.16
And so I'm very much into the neuroscience aspects these days.

504
00:23:20.16 --> 00:23:22.92
And on one of his podcasts,

505
00:23:22.92 --> 00:23:25.56
he was talking about, again,

506
00:23:25.56 --> 00:23:27.92
separating out the problems with law enforcement.

507
00:23:29.04 --> 00:23:30.84
And it happened to be a podcast

508
00:23:30.84 --> 00:23:33.52
on love and relationships, I think.

509
00:23:33.52 --> 00:23:35.80
And as I recall, he's talking about

510
00:23:35.80 --> 00:23:39.84
the basic four neurochemical hormones that drive us.

511
00:23:39.84 --> 00:23:42.56
And as I recall it primarily,

512
00:23:42.56 --> 00:23:46.36
testosterone, serotonin, oxytocin, serotonin.

513
00:23:47.84 --> 00:23:51.24
And he said, if you're essentially a testosterone type,

514
00:23:52.12 --> 00:23:55.000
you're more likely to see things as a challenge.

515
00:23:56.68 --> 00:24:01.04
So let's get out of race and get into type.

516
00:24:01.04 --> 00:24:03.88
You got a testosterone-driven comp,

517
00:24:03.88 --> 00:24:07.24
stopping a testosterone-driven male,

518
00:24:07.24 --> 00:24:09.68
and they're both gonna see almost everything

519
00:24:09.68 --> 00:24:11.96
that happens as a challenge.

520
00:24:11.96 --> 00:24:14.64
You can expect that to turn into a downward spiral,

521
00:24:14.64 --> 00:24:17.20
absent, better training.

522
00:24:17.20 --> 00:24:18.56
It's got nothing to do with race.

523
00:24:18.56 --> 00:24:22.16
The dynamic that I thought you were gonna say is,

524
00:24:22.16 --> 00:24:25.40
if I'm pulling you over and I'm by myself,

525
00:24:26.32 --> 00:24:27.36
well, I'm by myself.

526
00:24:27.36 --> 00:24:29.20
So I better de-escalate, right?

527
00:24:29.20 --> 00:24:30.04
I better be thinking.

528
00:24:30.04 --> 00:24:31.08
That's another point, yeah.

529
00:24:31.08 --> 00:24:33.36
Whereas if I'm with Echo and he's my partner,

530
00:24:33.36 --> 00:24:34.76
and you start getting mouthy,

531
00:24:34.76 --> 00:24:36.32
well, you know, we're gonna kick your ass.

532
00:24:36.32 --> 00:24:39.80
I feel more confident, more, just like in a bar, right?

533
00:24:39.80 --> 00:24:42.04
The guy that's in the bar that's by himself,

534
00:24:42.04 --> 00:24:43.44
he's not causing any problems.

535
00:24:43.44 --> 00:24:45.12
It's the guy that's with three of his friends,

536
00:24:45.12 --> 00:24:46.80
it's all of a sudden he's getting mouthy.

537
00:24:46.80 --> 00:24:48.84
Right, no, that's exactly right.

538
00:24:48.84 --> 00:24:53.84
And most police departments are running two-man patrols,

539
00:24:53.84 --> 00:24:55.16
two-person patrols.

540
00:24:55.16 --> 00:24:57.52
Yeah, it's weird for me because in my background,

541
00:24:57.52 --> 00:25:02.52
in the SEAL teams, if any possible way,

542
00:25:02.80 --> 00:25:04.12
you have a buddy with you.

543
00:25:04.12 --> 00:25:06.000
As a matter of fact, if you don't have a buddy with you,

544
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.80
you're kinda getting in trouble.

545
00:25:07.80 --> 00:25:10.72
So you're always, cause you can't watch your back,

546
00:25:10.72 --> 00:25:12.20
you just can't.

547
00:25:12.20 --> 00:25:14.44
So you always have someone with you.

548
00:25:14.44 --> 00:25:16.04
So I've always thought to myself,

549
00:25:16.04 --> 00:25:17.16
man, if I was a police officer,

550
00:25:17.16 --> 00:25:18.84
I'd really like to have a partner.

551
00:25:20.36 --> 00:25:21.40
Well, you're trained too.

552
00:25:21.40 --> 00:25:24.08
I mean, you're trained to not let your negative emotions

553
00:25:24.08 --> 00:25:26.24
get out of control.

554
00:25:26.24 --> 00:25:29.80
Yeah, I would definitely, you know,

555
00:25:29.80 --> 00:25:30.96
this is the same thing in the SEAL teams.

556
00:25:30.96 --> 00:25:33.08
I mean, you gotta learn to de-escalate things.

557
00:25:33.08 --> 00:25:34.64
And just being in a leadership position,

558
00:25:34.64 --> 00:25:35.88
you gotta learn to de-escalate things

559
00:25:35.88 --> 00:25:37.92
cause someone comes in and they're mad about something.

560
00:25:37.92 --> 00:25:39.56
And if you're in a leadership position,

561
00:25:39.56 --> 00:25:41.60
and all you do is go back at them,

562
00:25:41.60 --> 00:25:44.76
see they, you know, boss, this plan sucks.

563
00:25:44.76 --> 00:25:46.52
And you think, oh, you're challenging me?

564
00:25:46.52 --> 00:25:48.72
Instead of saying, oh, what sucks about the plan?

565
00:25:48.72 --> 00:25:50.20
Do you wanna make some adjustments to it?

566
00:25:50.20 --> 00:25:51.76
Like that's what you do.

567
00:25:51.76 --> 00:25:53.24
That's how you de-escalate it.

568
00:25:53.24 --> 00:25:54.40
You don't say, well, you don't understand

569
00:25:54.40 --> 00:25:56.20
the whole problem, there you go.

570
00:25:56.20 --> 00:26:00.60
So, yeah, that takes some training.

571
00:26:00.60 --> 00:26:03.36
So that takes some mental gymnastics

572
00:26:03.36 --> 00:26:05.36
to get to a point where you can do that.

573
00:26:06.88 --> 00:26:10.04
So now you're out there in Kansas City,

574
00:26:10.04 --> 00:26:11.88
a couple months, was there any moment

575
00:26:11.88 --> 00:26:15.92
where you felt like, oh, I messed up?

576
00:26:15.92 --> 00:26:19.20
Or did you ever feel like, okay, now I'm a cop?

577
00:26:19.20 --> 00:26:20.28
You know what I'm saying?

578
00:26:20.28 --> 00:26:21.24
No, I loved it.

579
00:26:21.24 --> 00:26:23.12
My first year there, I loved it.

580
00:26:23.12 --> 00:26:24.40
I absolutely loved it.

581
00:26:24.40 --> 00:26:28.44
I was in a commercial area, you know,

582
00:26:28.44 --> 00:26:33.44
a fair amount of street life, a little more fast paced.

583
00:26:34.08 --> 00:26:35.36
And that suited me.

584
00:26:35.36 --> 00:26:40.36
I'm not a real meticulous, super organized, super patient.

585
00:26:42.20 --> 00:26:46.36
By nature or nurture, I'm not sure which, but neither one.

586
00:26:47.20 --> 00:26:49.56
So my first year I had a ball.

587
00:26:49.56 --> 00:26:50.96
I mean, I had a ball.

588
00:26:50.96 --> 00:26:53.68
I mean, I was putting bad guys in jail.

589
00:26:53.68 --> 00:26:55.52
You know, I really loved it.

590
00:26:55.52 --> 00:27:00.20
I can even remember my parents came to visit me one time

591
00:27:00.20 --> 00:27:03.32
and we met at the, they came by the precinct

592
00:27:04.72 --> 00:27:05.88
towards the end of my shift.

593
00:27:05.88 --> 00:27:08.72
And I was told they were there, so we drove up

594
00:27:08.72 --> 00:27:11.72
and my mom said when she saw me get out of the car,

595
00:27:11.72 --> 00:27:13.52
she said the way you moved when you got out of the car,

596
00:27:13.52 --> 00:27:15.16
I saw a cop get out of that car.

597
00:27:16.76 --> 00:27:18.36
So then after I was there for a year,

598
00:27:18.36 --> 00:27:21.92
they switched me to a residential area,

599
00:27:21.92 --> 00:27:24.08
which is a different kind of work.

600
00:27:24.08 --> 00:27:25.72
You know, you're not making,

601
00:27:25.72 --> 00:27:28.36
locking up multiple guys in a night.

602
00:27:28.36 --> 00:27:31.48
You're looking for residential burglars.

603
00:27:31.48 --> 00:27:36.48
It's much more painstaking, meticulous patient work.

604
00:27:36.60 --> 00:27:39.80
And so I went from an area that I just loved

605
00:27:39.80 --> 00:27:42.96
to an area that I just wasn't, I wasn't built for.

606
00:27:42.96 --> 00:27:45.20
And I started getting bored when I was there.

607
00:27:45.20 --> 00:27:48.12
And is that when you started looking

608
00:27:48.12 --> 00:27:49.92
for something else to do?

609
00:27:49.92 --> 00:27:53.04
Well, you know, I don't know that it looked so much

610
00:27:53.04 --> 00:27:54.56
for something else to do.

611
00:27:54.56 --> 00:27:55.92
I was gonna, I was planning on,

612
00:27:55.92 --> 00:27:58.92
I wanted to become a member of the SWAT team.

613
00:27:58.92 --> 00:28:02.40
And it took three years to get on the SWAT team.

614
00:28:02.40 --> 00:28:06.52
So I'm there, you know, two-ish years.

615
00:28:06.52 --> 00:28:09.48
And the guys, I knew most of the guys that were

616
00:28:09.48 --> 00:28:10.84
on the SWAT team and they said,

617
00:28:10.84 --> 00:28:13.56
well, you know, put in for the selection process,

618
00:28:13.56 --> 00:28:14.60
you know, just go through it.

619
00:28:14.60 --> 00:28:16.56
If you put in, then the commanders,

620
00:28:16.56 --> 00:28:18.28
cams and sergeants are gonna get to know

621
00:28:18.28 --> 00:28:19.96
that you're interested, they're gonna keep an eye on you.

622
00:28:19.96 --> 00:28:23.64
Then next time around, you got a better shot.

623
00:28:23.64 --> 00:28:24.56
So I, cool.

624
00:28:24.56 --> 00:28:27.32
So I put in for the selection process,

625
00:28:27.32 --> 00:28:29.000
ended up number one on the list.

626
00:28:30.12 --> 00:28:32.84
Number one, no, shocked everybody.

627
00:28:32.84 --> 00:28:36.28
So the captains went to the Lieutenant Colonel

628
00:28:36.28 --> 00:28:38.08
and said, let's wave the three-year rule

629
00:28:38.08 --> 00:28:41.68
on number one guy here, isn't gonna have three years

630
00:28:41.68 --> 00:28:45.36
for 10 more months and Lieutenant Colonel said,

631
00:28:45.36 --> 00:28:49.92
I don't care, rules are rules, we're not waving them.

632
00:28:49.92 --> 00:28:54.000
So I'm gonna precinct them, board by.

633
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.50
They're taking everybody on the list under me one at a time.

634
00:28:59.48 --> 00:29:02.24
And there was even the discussion of the possibility

635
00:29:02.24 --> 00:29:05.68
that if they took everybody, they still wouldn't take me.

636
00:29:05.68 --> 00:29:08.12
They'd be a whole new selection process.

637
00:29:08.12 --> 00:29:09.72
So I'm a little annoyed by this.

638
00:29:09.72 --> 00:29:13.04
And then my father says,

639
00:29:13.88 --> 00:29:15.72
what you think about federal?

640
00:29:15.72 --> 00:29:17.60
Oh my God, I'm happy in Kansas City.

641
00:29:18.60 --> 00:29:21.84
So he introduces me to this guy with the Secret Service.

642
00:29:21.84 --> 00:29:24.68
And I talked to this guy and he says,

643
00:29:24.68 --> 00:29:27.52
you know, I've traveled all over the world

644
00:29:27.52 --> 00:29:28.72
with the Secret Service.

645
00:29:30.04 --> 00:29:34.52
And I remember thinking, somebody paid you

646
00:29:34.52 --> 00:29:38.12
and paid for your flights and paid for your hotel

647
00:29:38.12 --> 00:29:40.32
to go all over the world.

648
00:29:40.32 --> 00:29:42.000
Like I'm from Iowa.

649
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.48
Like I, you know, I'd seen Canada from a distance.

650
00:29:45.48 --> 00:29:47.92
That was the extent of my international travel.

651
00:29:47.92 --> 00:29:49.92
So I'm like, that sounds cool.

652
00:29:49.92 --> 00:29:53.46
And so I didn't know one federal agency from another.

653
00:29:53.46 --> 00:29:54.30
No idea.

654
00:29:55.28 --> 00:29:58.20
Secret Service, I would go down there, we're not hiring.

655
00:29:58.20 --> 00:29:59.76
Not hiring.

656
00:29:59.76 --> 00:30:01.84
So I see an article in a newspaper,

657
00:30:01.84 --> 00:30:04.40
FBI's first billion dollar budget.

658
00:30:04.40 --> 00:30:06.60
I knew enough about budgets that I thought

659
00:30:06.60 --> 00:30:09.12
it's gotta be salaries to gotta be hiring.

660
00:30:10.12 --> 00:30:12.20
I went down, I put in, it was the first

661
00:30:12.20 --> 00:30:14.72
of a three year hiring push.

662
00:30:14.72 --> 00:30:16.40
And I got in.

663
00:30:18.04 --> 00:30:18.96
And just like that.

664
00:30:18.96 --> 00:30:21.56
So how long is it between when you get accepted

665
00:30:21.56 --> 00:30:24.44
and when you're going to the FBI Academy?

666
00:30:25.42 --> 00:30:29.46
Yeah, well, October 31st,

667
00:30:30.48 --> 00:30:32.60
I'd had three years on a police department

668
00:30:32.60 --> 00:30:35.56
and I would have gone to the SWAT team.

669
00:30:36.68 --> 00:30:39.48
The bureau hired me on October 15th.

670
00:30:39.48 --> 00:30:44.48
And I remember, you know, I'm a dumb 20 something year old.

671
00:30:46.56 --> 00:30:49.96
I put in for the bureau.

672
00:30:49.96 --> 00:30:52.32
And I remember literally telling people, you know,

673
00:30:52.32 --> 00:30:54.76
whoever offers me a position first.

674
00:30:56.04 --> 00:30:58.52
SWAT team comes, I'm going with a SWAT team.

675
00:30:58.52 --> 00:31:00.82
The bureau comes, I'm going with the bureau.

676
00:31:00.82 --> 00:31:05.82
And then they kept the police department

677
00:31:06.34 --> 00:31:10.38
and had the chief at the time hated the FBI

678
00:31:10.38 --> 00:31:13.82
with a passion, hated the FBI.

679
00:31:13.82 --> 00:31:18.26
So they had a rule that if you left the police department,

680
00:31:18.26 --> 00:31:21.50
the only job you couldn't come back from

681
00:31:23.10 --> 00:31:25.22
was if you became an FBI agent.

682
00:31:25.22 --> 00:31:28.26
Now you go take a job as a dog catcher, they take it back.

683
00:31:28.26 --> 00:31:30.54
You go take a job, you know, think of something,

684
00:31:30.54 --> 00:31:33.54
a hairdresser, you know, I don't know what,

685
00:31:33.54 --> 00:31:35.78
but the only job, and in my accident interview,

686
00:31:35.78 --> 00:31:37.66
they literally told me, they said,

687
00:31:37.66 --> 00:31:39.26
you understand you can never come back

688
00:31:39.26 --> 00:31:40.98
if you join the bureau.

689
00:31:40.98 --> 00:31:43.94
Mike, well, that's not my intention to come back.

690
00:31:43.94 --> 00:31:47.02
But so consequently, I had to keep my application a secret

691
00:31:47.02 --> 00:31:48.98
till it was in the final stages.

692
00:31:48.98 --> 00:31:51.74
They couldn't go interview any of my commanders

693
00:31:51.74 --> 00:31:54.34
until they were sure that they were gonna hire me

694
00:31:54.34 --> 00:31:56.18
at the last minute.

695
00:31:56.18 --> 00:31:58.92
And you know, that led, I was still a mouthy 20 something.

696
00:31:58.92 --> 00:32:00.78
So that led to a couple of problems

697
00:32:00.78 --> 00:32:02.74
as I was going to the police department.

698
00:32:02.74 --> 00:32:03.70
What's the beef?

699
00:32:03.70 --> 00:32:04.62
Where's the beef?

700
00:32:04.62 --> 00:32:08.06
Did this guy have a specific beef with the FBI?

701
00:32:08.06 --> 00:32:11.10
Was it like a case where the feds came in

702
00:32:11.10 --> 00:32:12.82
like straight out of a movie?

703
00:32:12.82 --> 00:32:16.94
He had jurisdiction.

704
00:32:16.94 --> 00:32:21.94
Been seen talking on the street with ladies of the evening.

705
00:32:23.90 --> 00:32:28.74
And that a couple of bureau guys spotted him

706
00:32:28.74 --> 00:32:33.58
on the street with these ladies of the evening

707
00:32:33.58 --> 00:32:34.94
on the way to a meeting.

708
00:32:36.02 --> 00:32:39.22
And it made it back to the city council

709
00:32:39.22 --> 00:32:41.72
cause the agents were wondering

710
00:32:41.72 --> 00:32:44.34
whether or not they could trust the guy.

711
00:32:44.34 --> 00:32:47.14
And they said, you know, I don't work with this guy.

712
00:32:47.14 --> 00:32:49.82
And then he went on to like the FBI,

713
00:32:49.82 --> 00:32:52.58
this is how bad it got under this guy.

714
00:32:52.58 --> 00:32:55.94
I don't know if you're familiar with the FBI National Academy.

715
00:32:55.94 --> 00:32:57.98
But if you get sent to the National Academy,

716
00:32:57.98 --> 00:32:59.26
the Bureau pays all your expenses,

717
00:32:59.26 --> 00:33:01.38
pays for your flights,

718
00:33:01.38 --> 00:33:04.62
like doesn't cost an agency a dime

719
00:33:04.62 --> 00:33:06.90
to send somebody to the National Academy.

720
00:33:06.90 --> 00:33:09.14
And it's a stepping stone in a lot of police departments

721
00:33:09.14 --> 00:33:11.50
to becoming chief of the next promotion.

722
00:33:11.50 --> 00:33:12.34
It's a big deal.

723
00:33:12.34 --> 00:33:13.66
Yeah.

724
00:33:13.66 --> 00:33:16.82
I spoke at the last FBI National Academy meeting.

725
00:33:16.82 --> 00:33:18.14
Yeah, it was awesome.

726
00:33:18.14 --> 00:33:23.14
So I get there in the FBI Academy, you know, October 15th.

727
00:33:23.14 --> 00:33:26.94
And they start talking about how they pay all expenses

728
00:33:26.94 --> 00:33:29.14
for cops and I'm thinking,

729
00:33:29.14 --> 00:33:32.94
nobody from Kansas City has come here in 10 years.

730
00:33:32.94 --> 00:33:36.14
It can't be that it's free.

731
00:33:36.14 --> 00:33:37.94
Like, nah, it's free.

732
00:33:37.94 --> 00:33:40.14
That's how much this guy hated the FBI.

733
00:33:41.34 --> 00:33:43.74
So you get picked up for the FBI,

734
00:33:43.74 --> 00:33:45.94
you show up to the Academy, how's the Academy?

735
00:33:47.14 --> 00:33:48.14
Yeah, it was good.

736
00:33:49.74 --> 00:33:51.94
You know, running, shooting,

737
00:33:51.94 --> 00:33:56.94
mostly academic, the physical aspects of it

738
00:33:58.14 --> 00:34:00.34
were not super challenging.

739
00:34:00.34 --> 00:34:03.74
You could, if it would help you, at the time,

740
00:34:03.74 --> 00:34:05.14
you could be in no condition at all

741
00:34:05.14 --> 00:34:06.74
and they'd whip you into shape.

742
00:34:06.74 --> 00:34:11.74
They ended up having problems with that later on.

743
00:34:11.74 --> 00:34:13.74
And so now you can't get in unless you're

744
00:34:13.74 --> 00:34:15.74
at least in minimal physical condition.

745
00:34:15.74 --> 00:34:16.74
Got it.

746
00:34:16.74 --> 00:34:20.14
But you could come in and be fat completely out of shape.

747
00:34:20.14 --> 00:34:22.94
If you put in the effort, you'd meet the minimums.

748
00:34:23.94 --> 00:34:25.54
And they weren't huge.

749
00:34:25.54 --> 00:34:28.54
Like, FBI agents are not wrestling people to the ground

750
00:34:28.54 --> 00:34:29.54
on a regular basis.

751
00:34:29.54 --> 00:34:32.14
So they want you to be physically capable,

752
00:34:32.14 --> 00:34:35.54
but, you know, it was more rigorous than a police department

753
00:34:35.54 --> 00:34:37.74
because you might get into a wrestling match

754
00:34:37.74 --> 00:34:39.74
with somebody every day.

755
00:34:39.74 --> 00:34:44.74
And the Bureau's tactics is to outman, outgun the bad guys

756
00:34:44.74 --> 00:34:47.74
so that physical confrontations are unnecessary.

757
00:34:47.74 --> 00:34:49.34
So they want you to be able to handle yourself,

758
00:34:49.34 --> 00:34:50.74
but it's not that big of a deal.

759
00:34:50.74 --> 00:34:53.74
They really want you to do the classroom work.

760
00:34:53.74 --> 00:34:55.14
They want you to be able to shoot well.

761
00:34:55.14 --> 00:34:58.34
My shooting improved significantly from when I was there.

762
00:34:58.34 --> 00:35:01.34
And it was good solid 16 weeks.

763
00:35:01.34 --> 00:35:03.14
It was transformative.

764
00:35:03.14 --> 00:35:05.74
How are you looking at, because you're a cop

765
00:35:05.74 --> 00:35:07.94
coming off the main streets.

766
00:35:07.94 --> 00:35:09.94
And how are you looking at the college kids?

767
00:35:09.94 --> 00:35:13.94
They're like fun with that interaction?

768
00:35:13.94 --> 00:35:18.94
Yeah, I was a lot more harsh, so to speak.

769
00:35:18.94 --> 00:35:23.94
I was more aggressive, more blunt than the vast majority of them were.

770
00:35:23.94 --> 00:35:27.34
I was, and they come from all walks of life

771
00:35:27.34 --> 00:35:28.94
and they're going to turn them into agents.

772
00:35:28.94 --> 00:35:30.94
But I was, you know, I was a street cop.

773
00:35:30.94 --> 00:35:33.94
What percentage of people are previous cops rolling in there?

774
00:35:33.94 --> 00:35:34.94
Pretty small.

775
00:35:34.94 --> 00:35:35.94
Pretty small.

776
00:35:35.94 --> 00:35:40.94
At the time they hired in five categories.

777
00:35:40.94 --> 00:35:44.94
I was copster in the modified category, which is all others.

778
00:35:44.94 --> 00:35:45.94
Like you're not a lawyer.

779
00:35:45.94 --> 00:35:47.94
You're not an accountant.

780
00:35:47.94 --> 00:35:48.94
You're not a scientist.

781
00:35:48.94 --> 00:35:50.94
You're not a female.

782
00:35:50.94 --> 00:35:52.94
You're not a minority.

783
00:35:52.94 --> 00:35:53.94
You're not any others.

784
00:35:53.94 --> 00:35:54.94
You're not a language.

785
00:35:54.94 --> 00:35:57.94
You're not already fluent.

786
00:35:57.94 --> 00:36:00.94
So everybody else goes into a large category, modified,

787
00:36:00.94 --> 00:36:06.94
and it's a more competitive, theoretically, just more people there.

788
00:36:06.94 --> 00:36:07.94
And I was modified.

789
00:36:07.94 --> 00:36:08.94
So not that many cops.

790
00:36:08.94 --> 00:36:11.94
Did you have any challenges when you were there?

791
00:36:11.94 --> 00:36:13.94
Or is anything hard for you?

792
00:36:13.94 --> 00:36:15.94
No, I don't think so.

793
00:36:15.94 --> 00:36:16.94
Nothing there then.

794
00:36:16.94 --> 00:36:20.94
I mean, I was already in decent condition, took care of myself pretty well.

795
00:36:20.94 --> 00:36:23.94
I could study when I felt like it, and I already knew how to shoot.

796
00:36:23.94 --> 00:36:25.94
Do people get kicked out of the academy?

797
00:36:25.94 --> 00:36:27.94
Like, what percentage of people make it through?

798
00:36:27.94 --> 00:36:31.94
I mean, they got a good screening program, so I'm sure it's not that many.

799
00:36:31.94 --> 00:36:36.94
Yeah, it's even better now.

800
00:36:36.94 --> 00:36:38.94
And no, not that many did.

801
00:36:38.94 --> 00:36:40.94
Not that many did.

802
00:36:40.94 --> 00:36:45.94
Like if you got caught lying about anything, you should be shown the door.

803
00:36:45.94 --> 00:36:50.94
Any cheating should be shown the door.

804
00:36:50.94 --> 00:36:55.94
They had a problem with physical conditioning, because they tried to,

805
00:36:55.94 --> 00:37:00.94
they would enforce physical conditioning rules in the academy,

806
00:37:00.94 --> 00:37:05.94
but they're not, once you join, were actually in a field office as an agent.

807
00:37:05.94 --> 00:37:10.94
And somebody brought up, well, if legally you're full FBI agents

808
00:37:10.94 --> 00:37:15.94
from the moment you walk in the door, you shouldn't get fired from the academy

809
00:37:15.94 --> 00:37:20.94
on something you won't get fired from if you're in a field office.

810
00:37:20.94 --> 00:37:26.94
And you shouldn't be fattened out of shape in a field office.

811
00:37:26.94 --> 00:37:28.94
I just weren't firing people for that.

812
00:37:28.94 --> 00:37:34.94
So then they just raised the physical minimums to get in the door.

813
00:37:34.94 --> 00:37:36.94
Are you, when you're there,

814
00:37:36.94 --> 00:37:41.94
so is everyone getting trained just to be an agent?

815
00:37:41.94 --> 00:37:44.94
And is there, do you go to specialty training after that?

816
00:37:44.94 --> 00:37:48.94
So if I'm an accountant and they think I'm going to be looking at tax fraud,

817
00:37:48.94 --> 00:37:55.94
do I go there, I become an agent, and then I go to an advanced school to be a tax fraud guy?

818
00:37:55.94 --> 00:37:57.94
Pretty much exactly, yeah.

819
00:37:57.94 --> 00:38:00.94
The theory then, and I think it's still pretty true now,

820
00:38:00.94 --> 00:38:02.94
like being an FBI agent first, specialize afterwards.

821
00:38:02.94 --> 00:38:12.94
We've got to make sure that you understand how to be a generalist before you, you know, you follow your bliss for lack of a better time.

822
00:38:12.94 --> 00:38:19.94
Like somebody's breaking a law on every cool thing you could think of.

823
00:38:19.94 --> 00:38:27.94
Like if you were into collecting postage stamps, somebody's engaged in an act of criminal enterprise,

824
00:38:27.94 --> 00:38:31.94
making money from kind of a postage, I get a matter.

825
00:38:31.94 --> 00:38:42.94
So the cool thing about the FBI is that ultimately, if you take your time, you can have the best time investigating crimes,

826
00:38:42.94 --> 00:38:45.94
round stuff you're really interested in.

827
00:38:45.94 --> 00:38:56.94
But if I speak Spanish or I speak Russian, are they going to throw me into an assignment where this is my main gig as soon as I get done?

828
00:38:56.94 --> 00:38:58.94
Spanish guys for a while.

829
00:38:58.94 --> 00:39:07.94
Everybody had that if you got hired in the Spanish program, everybody was going to have to do a stint in Puerto Rico.

830
00:39:07.94 --> 00:39:09.94
Those were the only ones at the time.

831
00:39:09.94 --> 00:39:13.94
Puerto Rico's Bureau's got its hands full in Puerto Rico.

832
00:39:13.94 --> 00:39:24.94
Puerto Rico is doesn't know if it wants to be a state or a commonwealth, you know, infrastructure problems on the one hand.

833
00:39:24.94 --> 00:39:35.94
Still, you know, back in my time in the Bureau, still a couple of active groups that engaging in violence for independence.

834
00:39:35.94 --> 00:39:42.94
So this just crazy combination of very difficult things to work in Puerto Rico.

835
00:39:42.94 --> 00:39:46.94
So if you're a Spanish speaker, you're going to do time in Puerto Rico.

836
00:39:46.94 --> 00:39:47.94
That was the only language.

837
00:39:47.94 --> 00:39:55.94
So as a normal agent, what would for you, for instance, do you get any say in where you're going and what you're getting assigned to?

838
00:39:55.94 --> 00:39:56.94
No.

839
00:39:56.94 --> 00:39:58.94
They're just going to give you what they're going to give you?

840
00:39:58.94 --> 00:39:59.94
Not then.

841
00:39:59.94 --> 00:40:08.94
At then the Bureau's policy, which made complete sense, like starting your life over as an FBI agent, it's a big jump.

842
00:40:08.94 --> 00:40:12.94
And the easiest way effectively is to go into a witness security program.

843
00:40:12.94 --> 00:40:20.94
It's a complete new identity, no ties to your old identity at all, because it's the easiest way to become an FBI agent.

844
00:40:20.94 --> 00:40:23.94
Like nobody, nobody, you're not around people you went to high school with.

845
00:40:23.94 --> 00:40:26.94
You're not around your neighbors, you're not even around family.

846
00:40:26.94 --> 00:40:34.94
Oh, so you're saying not literally like it's witness protection, but they take you and they're not going to send you back to where you're from.

847
00:40:34.94 --> 00:40:39.94
They're going to send you to some other city so you don't have to run into the people you used to know.

848
00:40:39.94 --> 00:40:41.94
You're going to be, it's a new life.

849
00:40:41.94 --> 00:40:42.94
That was back then.

850
00:40:42.94 --> 00:40:45.94
Now the problem with that, it was a very expensive.

851
00:40:45.94 --> 00:40:49.94
I'm in Kansas City, they sent me to Pittsburgh for two years.

852
00:40:49.94 --> 00:40:52.94
They get me ready to go to one of the major offices.

853
00:40:52.94 --> 00:40:53.94
Is this what they actually did with you?

854
00:40:53.94 --> 00:40:54.94
Yeah.

855
00:40:54.94 --> 00:40:55.94
So this is your first assignment is Pittsburgh?

856
00:40:55.94 --> 00:40:56.94
Two years in Pittsburgh.

857
00:40:56.94 --> 00:41:03.94
You get some kind of a special assignment like you're going to be working gang, you're going to be working drug, you're going to be, or you just working.

858
00:41:03.94 --> 00:41:14.94
Most offices start you out working applicants because you got to get used to laying the credentials on somebody in a low stress environment.

859
00:41:14.94 --> 00:41:24.94
So if you're doing a background investigation, you're walking into a bank because somebody used to work in a bank once you become an agent or something else where the background's required.

860
00:41:24.94 --> 00:41:26.94
Jeez, that's not the rush you were looking for was it?

861
00:41:26.94 --> 00:41:34.94
It's a little slow to start out with, but you know, the first couple of times, you know, crazy things where you hold your creds up in front of somebody, you're used to that.

862
00:41:34.94 --> 00:41:39.94
Or if you're going into a bank to lock somebody up, that's a whole different.

863
00:41:39.94 --> 00:41:45.94
So they warm you up in applicants and then depend upon where you are, where you're going to get assigned to.

864
00:41:45.94 --> 00:41:52.94
I initially get assigned to foreign counterintelligence, FCI, working spies, which is not for me.

865
00:41:52.94 --> 00:41:56.94
Again, that's slow meticulous work.

866
00:41:56.94 --> 00:42:03.94
And so I, within rules, now I'm scheming on how to get out of there.

867
00:42:03.94 --> 00:42:07.94
You get there, you get assigned this foreign counterintelligence.

868
00:42:07.94 --> 00:42:10.94
You already know this is really not your gig.

869
00:42:10.94 --> 00:42:11.94
So what's your scam?

870
00:42:11.94 --> 00:42:12.94
What do you run?

871
00:42:12.94 --> 00:42:13.94
How do you try and maneuver?

872
00:42:13.94 --> 00:42:24.94
Well, as it turns out, the guy's ahead of the office, his kid is getting ready to go to college in Iowa State.

873
00:42:24.94 --> 00:42:27.94
So I'm not that far from out of Iowa State.

874
00:42:27.94 --> 00:42:30.94
I'm like, look, you know, I'll connect you with some friends.

875
00:42:30.94 --> 00:42:35.94
You know, we'll help make sure your landing is a soft landing.

876
00:42:35.94 --> 00:42:37.94
And, you know, I help look out for his kid.

877
00:42:37.94 --> 00:42:39.94
Building some relationships.

878
00:42:39.94 --> 00:42:41.94
Relationship building.

879
00:42:41.94 --> 00:42:46.94
And so then he initially, I want to go to the drug squad, drug and organized crime.

880
00:42:46.94 --> 00:42:47.94
The different choices.

881
00:42:47.94 --> 00:42:50.94
They got a bank robbery squad, great squad.

882
00:42:50.94 --> 00:42:55.94
I got no shot at the bank robbery squad, drug and organized crime or white collar.

883
00:42:55.94 --> 00:42:58.94
So let me do the drugs and organized crime.

884
00:42:58.94 --> 00:43:04.94
This guy, I'm told he's going to send me a drug and organized crime.

885
00:43:04.94 --> 00:43:10.94
And then when the transfer comes through, I'm on surveillance, which ended up being a great thing.

886
00:43:10.94 --> 00:43:13.94
It was better than FCI.

887
00:43:13.94 --> 00:43:21.94
But then you, you know, that's that assignment played into where I ended up in New York and surveillance is you get experiment with stuff.

888
00:43:21.94 --> 00:43:30.94
And, and all the field divisions surveillance is a light undercover that you got, you got a name, different last name.

889
00:43:30.94 --> 00:43:32.94
You got the ID, you got credit cards.

890
00:43:32.94 --> 00:43:39.94
And even if you got somebody you're following, whether it's a drug dealer or a spy gets on a plane,

891
00:43:39.94 --> 00:43:40.94
you got to go with them.

892
00:43:40.94 --> 00:43:42.94
You got to be able to pay for it.

893
00:43:42.94 --> 00:43:45.94
You know, you got to be able to go.

894
00:43:45.94 --> 00:43:52.94
So I got a chance to do some undercover work there also because then they're borrowing the guys and the surveillance teams.

895
00:43:52.94 --> 00:43:54.94
You've already got an undercover backstop.

896
00:43:54.94 --> 00:43:57.94
You got by do drug buys.

897
00:43:57.94 --> 00:44:02.94
And that's when I found out to be an undercover is the life or living.

898
00:44:02.94 --> 00:44:05.94
And it didn't fit me.

899
00:44:05.94 --> 00:44:06.94
Didn't suit me.

900
00:44:06.94 --> 00:44:08.94
Some, some people it's fine.

901
00:44:08.94 --> 00:44:10.94
It works for you.

902
00:44:10.94 --> 00:44:12.94
But lying for a living didn't work for me.

903
00:44:12.94 --> 00:44:14.94
And undercover sounds sexy.

904
00:44:14.94 --> 00:44:15.94
But he wants to do undercover.

905
00:44:15.94 --> 00:44:16.94
I mean, it sounds sexy.

906
00:44:16.94 --> 00:44:18.94
I want to get that one to buy drugs.

907
00:44:18.94 --> 00:44:20.94
You know, I want to go in and organize crime.

908
00:44:20.94 --> 00:44:22.94
I want to do all this stuff.

909
00:44:22.94 --> 00:44:27.94
And until you try it, something that sounds sexy, you don't really know if it's for you.

910
00:44:27.94 --> 00:44:31.94
So I got a chance to try it a couple of, a few times in Pittsburgh.

911
00:44:31.94 --> 00:44:34.94
And I just realized it just wasn't for me.

912
00:44:34.94 --> 00:44:37.94
I had two friends.

913
00:44:37.94 --> 00:44:40.94
One of them went to the FBI.

914
00:44:40.94 --> 00:44:43.94
The, or that was trying to go from the SEAL teams to the FBI.

915
00:44:43.94 --> 00:44:47.94
The other one was going to another agency inside the government.

916
00:44:47.94 --> 00:44:49.94
And they both went to the screening.

917
00:44:49.94 --> 00:44:51.94
And the guy that was going to the FBI comes back.

918
00:44:51.94 --> 00:44:53.94
He said, God, I took the freaking lie detector test.

919
00:44:53.94 --> 00:44:55.94
That thing was crazy.

920
00:44:55.94 --> 00:45:02.94
You know, as soon as they, they said, pick a number between one and five and tell us, you know, don't tell us the number when we ask you if it's the number.

921
00:45:02.94 --> 00:45:03.94
And he goes, okay.

922
00:45:03.94 --> 00:45:06.94
And so he's, you know, thinking of three and they go, is it one?

923
00:45:06.94 --> 00:45:07.94
And he goes, no.

924
00:45:07.94 --> 00:45:09.94
And the, the, the thing's all flat.

925
00:45:09.94 --> 00:45:10.94
He goes, is it two?

926
00:45:10.94 --> 00:45:11.94
And he goes, no.

927
00:45:11.94 --> 00:45:14.94
And as soon as he says that, he goes, the thing starts going wild.

928
00:45:14.94 --> 00:45:15.94
Is it three?

929
00:45:15.94 --> 00:45:16.94
He said it's off.

930
00:45:16.94 --> 00:45:17.94
He goes, they knew exactly.

931
00:45:17.94 --> 00:45:18.94
Because I told him that.

932
00:45:18.94 --> 00:45:22.94
And, and he was one of those guys like he just wasn't comfortable lying.

933
00:45:22.94 --> 00:45:24.94
And it just, it just called him out.

934
00:45:24.94 --> 00:45:28.94
Now my other friend who went to another agency, he comes back from his interview.

935
00:45:28.94 --> 00:45:30.94
And he goes, yeah, I took that lie detector test.

936
00:45:30.94 --> 00:45:31.94
And I go, how was that?

937
00:45:31.94 --> 00:45:32.94
He goes, I flat lied it.

938
00:45:32.94 --> 00:45:35.94
And the, the, he said, he said, he said, you know, I'm not lying.

939
00:45:35.94 --> 00:45:39.94
He said, he just, yeah, he just, I, that thing couldn't, he, I just, I just blew through

940
00:45:39.94 --> 00:45:40.94
it.

941
00:45:40.94 --> 00:45:41.94
And here's the thing.

942
00:45:41.94 --> 00:45:43.94
I actually don't know if he was lying, because he lied a lot.

943
00:45:43.94 --> 00:45:47.94
This guy, you know, he was one of those guys that told like small, small lies all the time.

944
00:45:47.94 --> 00:45:48.94
You know, he's talking to a girl.

945
00:45:48.94 --> 00:45:49.94
He's telling a crazy story.

946
00:45:49.94 --> 00:45:50.94
He's talking to some other dude.

947
00:45:50.94 --> 00:45:54.44
He's telling some, even when he's talking to you, you know, you know, those kind of

948
00:45:54.44 --> 00:45:57.94
friends that you have where the, you know, they're kind of lying about stuff.

949
00:45:57.94 --> 00:45:59.94
Like, you know, you're good with it.

950
00:45:59.94 --> 00:46:02.58
It's just white lies, but it's all the time.

951
00:46:02.58 --> 00:46:03.58
He was one of those guys.

952
00:46:03.58 --> 00:46:06.58
And so I kind of believed him when he told me he flat-lined the thing.

953
00:46:06.58 --> 00:46:07.58
You probably, yeah.

954
00:46:07.58 --> 00:46:09.58
But he may have been even lying about that.

955
00:46:09.58 --> 00:46:11.58
I'm not sure.

956
00:46:11.58 --> 00:46:17.58
But that idea, you know, for me, I'm like you, like, I don't want to be, I don't like to

957
00:46:17.58 --> 00:46:21.58
have like, I don't like to have to cover like lie about stuff and make stuff up.

958
00:46:21.58 --> 00:46:23.58
And it just doesn't sit well with me.

959
00:46:23.58 --> 00:46:26.58
I wouldn't be a good undercover guy.

960
00:46:26.58 --> 00:46:28.58
So how long did you have to do that for?

961
00:46:28.58 --> 00:46:32.58
I was, I wore surveillance for about a year and a half.

962
00:46:32.58 --> 00:46:37.58
Now, a lot of times you're just straight up sitting in like the plumbing van on the

963
00:46:37.58 --> 00:46:41.58
corner, with a camera, taking pictures.

964
00:46:41.58 --> 00:46:42.58
That's what you're doing.

965
00:46:42.58 --> 00:46:43.58
Yeah.

966
00:46:43.58 --> 00:46:47.58
Or even if you're in a chase vehicle, where you're following them, like they're moving

967
00:46:47.58 --> 00:46:51.58
for of an eight, 10 hour shift, they're moving for an hour max.

968
00:46:51.58 --> 00:46:54.58
So you're sitting around no matter what.

969
00:46:54.58 --> 00:46:56.58
So this is still not what you came in to do?

970
00:46:56.58 --> 00:46:58.58
No, yeah, it wasn't.

971
00:46:58.58 --> 00:47:03.58
You know, I'm, and I'm, I'm buying my time in Pittsburgh at the time because I knew that,

972
00:47:03.58 --> 00:47:06.58
you know, I'm going to be out of there soon.

973
00:47:06.58 --> 00:47:10.58
What is it a two year assignments that you guys get roughly at the time it was roughly

974
00:47:10.58 --> 00:47:13.58
two years for the movie on to one of the top offices.

975
00:47:13.58 --> 00:47:19.58
They called it the top 12 the time, but everybody was going to New York at the time.

976
00:47:19.58 --> 00:47:22.58
Every FBI agent, everyone in the country got paid the same amount of money.

977
00:47:22.58 --> 00:47:26.58
If you were, if you an agent in Kansas City, if you're an agent in my hometown,

978
00:47:26.58 --> 00:47:31.58
Mount Pleasant, Iowa, you got paid the exact same amount of money somebody in New York

979
00:47:31.58 --> 00:47:32.58
got paid.

980
00:47:32.58 --> 00:47:35.58
So consequently, there were people in New York were quitting right and left.

981
00:47:35.58 --> 00:47:37.58
They were having trouble staff in the office.

982
00:47:37.58 --> 00:47:40.58
And they said, look, you're, you're going to New York.

983
00:47:40.58 --> 00:47:45.58
I mean, the orders aren't here yet, but nine out of 10 of you coming out of this class,

984
00:47:45.58 --> 00:47:47.58
you guys are all going to end up in New York.

985
00:47:47.58 --> 00:47:49.58
So you're going.

986
00:47:49.58 --> 00:47:53.58
Don't be shocked when your orders for New York come through.

987
00:47:53.58 --> 00:47:57.58
So I'm in Pittsburgh, I'm waiting for the orders to New York to come through.

988
00:47:57.58 --> 00:48:04.58
And so what year is this that you finally get orders to New York 1985.

989
00:48:04.58 --> 00:48:05.58
1985.

990
00:48:05.58 --> 00:48:10.58
The day my son Brandon was born was the exact same day I got my orders to New York were

991
00:48:10.58 --> 00:48:12.58
printed.

992
00:48:12.58 --> 00:48:18.58
You roll up to New York and what, what do you get assigned when you get up there?

993
00:48:18.58 --> 00:48:22.58
I catch a break.

994
00:48:22.58 --> 00:48:27.58
Since I got surveillance time and since I've been a cop, the joint terrorist has forced

995
00:48:27.58 --> 00:48:31.58
the surveillance team dedicated to them.

996
00:48:31.58 --> 00:48:33.58
Needed, needed bodies.

997
00:48:33.58 --> 00:48:37.58
And I, because of my surveillance time, I got put right on.

998
00:48:37.58 --> 00:48:44.58
So that was, that was a huge break for a whole bunch of reasons.

999
00:48:44.58 --> 00:48:47.58
It was, I saved a lot of money.

1000
00:48:47.58 --> 00:48:50.58
Didn't have to pay for suits and dry cleaning.

1001
00:48:50.58 --> 00:48:55.58
That's a, you know, the cost of living is now increased from my living standards,

1002
00:48:55.58 --> 00:48:57.58
taking a step back.

1003
00:48:57.58 --> 00:49:06.58
And then the second thing was at the time the surveillance teams were the only guys that took cars home surveillance and SWAT took cars home.

1004
00:49:06.58 --> 00:49:12.58
And so this takes care of all my community expenses, which is another significant chunk of cash.

1005
00:49:12.58 --> 00:49:18.58
So, and then I'm with New York City cops as partners that joined terrorist task force surveillance team.

1006
00:49:18.58 --> 00:49:28.58
The coolest thing of it was we were the only surveillance team in New York that actually got out on the street with people went into the subway.

1007
00:49:28.58 --> 00:49:44.58
You had to be prepared to end up anywhere in New York City at one o'clock in the morning, toughest neighborhood, by yourself, no comms with anybody, like totally on your own.

1008
00:49:44.58 --> 00:49:52.58
And you develop, you know, it's a chat in New York, very dangerous time, 19, mid to late 80s, very dangerous.

1009
00:49:52.58 --> 00:49:57.58
So if you're, if you're into this job, like this is great. This is a Disney world every day.

1010
00:49:57.58 --> 00:50:01.58
Like how do you end up in the South Bronx and the bad guys leave you alone?

1011
00:50:01.58 --> 00:50:06.58
I remember the first time I'm going through bedside about one o'clock in the morning.

1012
00:50:06.58 --> 00:50:11.58
And we, you know, we could use pay phones, you know, you had special number, you could use a pay phone, not cost you.

1013
00:50:11.58 --> 00:50:16.58
I called some friends of mine in Iowa to say, guess where I am at right now?

1014
00:50:16.58 --> 00:50:22.58
I am in bedside in a drug neighborhood hanging out.

1015
00:50:22.58 --> 00:50:26.58
Now you're, you said you were the counter terrorist team. Is that right?

1016
00:50:26.58 --> 00:50:29.58
Yeah. Well, joint terrorist task force, which is task force.

1017
00:50:29.58 --> 00:50:37.58
Yeah. Yeah. I think I know there's some terms of art versus anti terrorist versus counter terrorist. I think we're counter terrorist.

1018
00:50:37.58 --> 00:50:44.58
And so who you tracking? How you ended up in, you know, some drug infested part of the city? Who you track it?

1019
00:50:44.58 --> 00:50:53.58
It was, it was a very cool transition time. The terrorist task force started out mostly all domestic terrorism.

1020
00:50:53.58 --> 00:51:05.58
And had every ethnic group had a terrorist group. Puerto Ricans had the FLIN, the March Taros, Jewish JDL bombers.

1021
00:51:05.58 --> 00:51:16.58
Black Panthers had turned into the Black Liberation Army and the most dangerous one of all, the May 19th Commence Organization,

1022
00:51:16.58 --> 00:51:28.58
which was mostly white female lesbians. And they were the smartest, the most organized, the most effective of all the groups.

1023
00:51:28.58 --> 00:51:39.58
Like they, we had more respect for their organization and the way they, and at one point in time, domestically, all the groups got together.

1024
00:51:39.58 --> 00:51:44.58
Because it's like a professional association where you have competencies. They know, they hang out together. They know each other.

1025
00:51:44.58 --> 00:51:52.58
And they did a couple of joint operations and a May 19th were so disappointed in the organization of the other groups that they finally said,

1026
00:51:52.58 --> 00:51:59.58
you guys go on your own. So the first, first generation of terrorist task force put them all in jail. I mean, knocked them out.

1027
00:51:59.58 --> 00:52:06.58
They, they, you know, they won awards right and left. Books were written about all the cases they made.

1028
00:52:06.58 --> 00:52:20.58
So I get there and I join that justice that's going away and simultaneously just as the Islamic radicals are starting to come to town.

1029
00:52:20.58 --> 00:52:26.58
Like I get there just a couple of years before the first World Trade Center bombing and we're seeing a shift.

1030
00:52:26.58 --> 00:52:32.58
But the bizarre part of it was no one believed this.

1031
00:52:32.58 --> 00:52:34.58
No one believed.

1032
00:52:34.58 --> 00:52:43.58
No one, no one, no one, FBI headquarters, New York City Police Department, they were actually in the process of disbanding the terrorist task force.

1033
00:52:43.58 --> 00:52:56.58
When the first World Trade Center bombing occurred in 93, some of my supervisors, a deputy chief famously said to one of my supervisors,

1034
00:52:56.58 --> 00:53:04.58
you're telling me about pink elephants walking down Broadway because they felt there was no terrorism in the United States because none of the incidents were,

1035
00:53:04.58 --> 00:53:07.58
were occurring on American soil.

1036
00:53:07.58 --> 00:53:14.58
And we had all been reassigned to gang crimes. Gang crimes was, was a really big thing at the time.

1037
00:53:14.58 --> 00:53:20.58
And they took us, they disbanded the terrorist task force and they reassigned us all the gang cases.

1038
00:53:20.58 --> 00:53:27.58
So you're there, they disband this terrorist task force after they kind of broke a bunch of these domestic terrorist groups up.

1039
00:53:27.58 --> 00:53:29.58
They say, yeah, there's no more threat.

1040
00:53:29.58 --> 00:53:34.58
Were you guys already saying, hey, no, there's an Islamic extremist threat or were you not quite there yet?

1041
00:53:34.58 --> 00:53:37.58
We weren't, we weren't quite there yet. We sensed something was going on.

1042
00:53:37.58 --> 00:53:43.58
And so we took all our terrorist cases and made them gang cases because they qualified as gang cases.

1043
00:53:43.58 --> 00:53:46.58
Okay, so you guys are now part of this gang task force?

1044
00:53:46.58 --> 00:54:00.58
We're working in gang crimes, you know, the different groups, wherever they originated from, at the different time, at the time, there were a couple of bank robbery crews that were,

1045
00:54:00.58 --> 00:54:09.58
they realized if we call where we hang out a mosque, then we just pulled another layer of the First Amendment over us.

1046
00:54:09.58 --> 00:54:12.58
And it's that much harder to get to get at us.

1047
00:54:12.58 --> 00:54:22.58
So they said, you know, criminals and their, and every religion has legitimate practitioners.

1048
00:54:22.58 --> 00:54:31.58
So it's not the legitimate practitioners fault that the criminals changed the name of the building to hang out in to a mosque.

1049
00:54:31.58 --> 00:54:34.58
And that's what a bunch of them did.

1050
00:54:34.58 --> 00:54:40.58
And we went from literally the first World Trade Center bombing, a couple of guys that were investigating some bank robberies.

1051
00:54:40.58 --> 00:54:47.58
We're trying to get a wire in a building that the bank robbers said was a mosque and the prosecutors wouldn't touch it.

1052
00:54:47.58 --> 00:54:53.58
Like, we are not, we don't care what you find. We're not putting a wire in a church.

1053
00:54:53.58 --> 00:54:57.58
And then the Trade Center happened and they turned right back around.

1054
00:54:57.58 --> 00:55:04.58
And with all the probable cause we'd previously established, we got the wires that we needed right after the First Trade Center bombing.

1055
00:55:04.58 --> 00:55:11.58
So were you in that gang task force doing surveillance when the first World Trade Center attack happened?

1056
00:55:11.58 --> 00:55:18.58
I had been, I had shifted from surveillance to what we call going inside being part of the investigative squad.

1057
00:55:18.58 --> 00:55:20.58
So I was no longer doing light cover.

1058
00:55:20.58 --> 00:55:32.58
And I had been doing investigations overtly for probably about two years when the first Trade Center bombing happened.

1059
00:55:32.58 --> 00:55:38.58
How, how, how surprised were we on that first World Trade Center bombing?

1060
00:55:38.58 --> 00:55:45.58
Like, no, yeah, completely. There were some cases that we had had working.

1061
00:55:45.58 --> 00:55:53.58
We just, we didn't imagine, we didn't have our arms around the guys that did the bombing.

1062
00:55:53.58 --> 00:56:01.58
We actually had, we were looking real hard at a particular group that engaged in a test blast of the Trade Center explosive.

1063
00:56:01.58 --> 00:56:07.58
They were tricked into the test blast. They didn't even know what was going on.

1064
00:56:07.58 --> 00:56:12.58
The obsec of the guys that hit the First Trade Center was really, really good.

1065
00:56:12.58 --> 00:56:22.58
And Ramsey Youssef, mastermind in the First Trade Center bombing, who was in fact Khaled Sheikh Mohammed's nephew, 9-11 mastermind.

1066
00:56:22.58 --> 00:56:26.58
His nephew Ramsey Youssef did the first, he came to town.

1067
00:56:26.58 --> 00:56:28.58
He brought the plans with him.

1068
00:56:28.58 --> 00:56:32.58
He found a bunch of disorganized guys.

1069
00:56:32.58 --> 00:56:37.58
You know, nobody, nobody really appreciated what he was, how organized he was.

1070
00:56:37.58 --> 00:56:43.58
He pulled the whole thing together and left New York shortly before the bomb went off.

1071
00:56:43.58 --> 00:56:45.58
And we got lucky on that bombing.

1072
00:56:45.58 --> 00:56:46.58
Yeah.

1073
00:56:46.58 --> 00:56:48.58
The amount of damage that could have done.

1074
00:56:48.58 --> 00:56:50.58
Ridiculous, ridiculously lucky.

1075
00:56:50.58 --> 00:56:53.58
And their intention was, first time was to take the tower down.

1076
00:56:53.58 --> 00:56:57.58
They placed the bomb in a position to try to drop one tower into the next.

1077
00:56:57.58 --> 00:57:10.58
And when Ramsey came back, we brought him back collectively, I'm told, that they flew by the trade center and he told the guys in a plane next time we're taking it down.

1078
00:57:10.58 --> 00:57:13.58
How did this impact your job?

1079
00:57:13.58 --> 00:57:16.58
So once this happens, is it like full focus?

1080
00:57:16.58 --> 00:57:21.58
Now you realize you got to pay, the FBI needs to pay attention to the Islamic extremists?

1081
00:57:21.58 --> 00:57:22.58
Yeah.

1082
00:57:22.58 --> 00:57:24.58
Well, we got on them in a hurry.

1083
00:57:24.58 --> 00:57:30.58
We, we'd been working different aspects of the group for about five years.

1084
00:57:30.58 --> 00:57:38.58
And everything they did, there was tremendous restrictions on terrorist investigations because they saw it as a political investigation.

1085
00:57:38.58 --> 00:57:43.58
So the oversight, like we had to re-justify the cases every six months.

1086
00:57:43.58 --> 00:57:51.58
And if you had, if they hadn't committed a crime, or we hadn't turned up a crime in that six month timeframe, the investigation's got shut down.

1087
00:57:51.58 --> 00:57:53.58
You couldn't pursue it.

1088
00:57:53.58 --> 00:58:00.58
So, but consequently, we had little bits and pieces all along that when they hit the trade center, we could go back to the previous cases.

1089
00:58:00.58 --> 00:58:03.58
Well, here's a piece here, here's a piece here, here's a piece here.

1090
00:58:03.58 --> 00:58:13.58
And we now saw how the group had coalesced in the United States by not breaking a law in their own way.

1091
00:58:13.58 --> 00:58:22.58
For example, one guy, one of the ring leaders got stopped in a car, pulled over in a car, stopped trunkload of weapons.

1092
00:58:22.58 --> 00:58:27.58
One of them, one of the passengers in a car had a federal fire license.

1093
00:58:27.58 --> 00:58:29.58
It had dealer tags on a car.

1094
00:58:29.58 --> 00:58:34.58
Wasn't to write the reason it got stopped was because the tags didn't match the car.

1095
00:58:34.58 --> 00:58:37.58
They had legitimate reason for having a dealer tags.

1096
00:58:37.58 --> 00:58:40.58
The, the license plate you put on any car you want driving around.

1097
00:58:40.58 --> 00:58:41.58
You're golden.

1098
00:58:41.58 --> 00:58:45.58
So legitimate car stop within the laws of the United States.

1099
00:58:45.58 --> 00:58:48.58
No reason to take anybody to jail.

1100
00:58:48.58 --> 00:58:55.58
When we start backtracking, we see same guys in a car with a bunch of weapons on a way to a firing range.

1101
00:58:55.58 --> 00:59:02.58
So we, when, when we could bring all the pieces together, it all came together pretty fast.

1102
00:59:02.58 --> 00:59:09.58
At what point did you get interested or start to get involved in negotiation?

1103
00:59:09.58 --> 00:59:20.58
Yeah, I had, I had, I would say it would be fair to say utterly no interest in being a hostage negotiator when I first joined a bureau.

1104
00:59:20.58 --> 00:59:23.58
I was on a SWAT team in Pittsburgh.

1105
00:59:23.58 --> 00:59:25.58
I got to New York.

1106
00:59:25.58 --> 00:59:27.58
I tried out for HRT.

1107
00:59:27.58 --> 00:59:34.58
I was ridiculously underprepared when I tried out for HRT.

1108
00:59:34.58 --> 00:59:36.58
I was just like sad.

1109
00:59:36.58 --> 00:59:41.58
But knew that I could do it if I worked at it.

1110
00:59:41.58 --> 00:59:44.58
You know, you can't train a couple of weekends.

1111
00:59:44.58 --> 00:59:46.58
You got to, you got to train your, your tail off for a year.

1112
00:59:46.58 --> 00:59:48.58
It's got to become a lifestyle.

1113
00:59:48.58 --> 00:59:49.58
I don't have to tell you that.

1114
00:59:49.58 --> 00:59:50.58
I mean, that's what it is.

1115
00:59:50.58 --> 00:59:51.58
It's a lifestyle.

1116
00:59:51.58 --> 01:00:02.58
So I tried out for HRT and failed miserably and then started working out again and re-injured my knee and my knee put back together for the second time.

1117
01:00:02.58 --> 01:00:10.58
And then I thought, all right, so, and as probably as you well know, there's a shelf life, there's special operations, special forces.

1118
01:00:10.58 --> 01:00:12.58
Then you were expired.

1119
01:00:12.58 --> 01:00:14.58
You're going to expire at some point in time.

1120
01:00:14.58 --> 01:00:20.58
You know, something's going to break too many times and you're not going to be able to do it anymore.

1121
01:00:20.58 --> 01:00:22.58
So then I thought, all right, so we got negotiators.

1122
01:00:22.58 --> 01:00:24.58
I've seen these guys out there, they're there all the time.

1123
01:00:24.58 --> 01:00:26.58
Crisis response.

1124
01:00:26.58 --> 01:00:31.58
I'll be a negotiator because crisis requires a decision.

1125
01:00:31.58 --> 01:00:35.58
Somebody's got to decide what to do and decide now.

1126
01:00:35.58 --> 01:00:38.58
And I wanted to stay in that game and do it.

1127
01:00:38.58 --> 01:00:46.58
So I thought, I thought I would angle myself towards the negotiation team and had to jump through some hoops, but eventually made it.

1128
01:00:46.58 --> 01:00:51.58
So this is what year is this that you, that you make it to negotiation team?

1129
01:00:51.58 --> 01:00:54.58
I got trained in 92.

1130
01:00:54.58 --> 01:00:55.58
92.

1131
01:00:55.58 --> 01:01:01.58
19 last century, 1992 before cell phones.

1132
01:01:01.58 --> 01:01:04.58
And so this is inside the FBI.

1133
01:01:04.58 --> 01:01:06.58
There's a detachment of negotiators.

1134
01:01:06.58 --> 01:01:08.58
Is that the way it's set up?

1135
01:01:08.58 --> 01:01:10.58
You can do it as an additional duty.

1136
01:01:10.58 --> 01:01:13.58
Like when you're a street agent, there's something in you.

1137
01:01:13.58 --> 01:01:16.58
There's four basic additional assignments.

1138
01:01:16.58 --> 01:01:18.58
Something in you is going to resonate with one of those four.

1139
01:01:18.58 --> 01:01:23.58
You can be an undercover, you could be a negotiator, you could be in SWAT.

1140
01:01:23.58 --> 01:01:26.58
You could be a bomb tech.

1141
01:01:26.58 --> 01:01:29.58
Each one of those a little bit different breed of cat.

1142
01:01:29.58 --> 01:01:34.58
And something in you is really going to line up with one of those things.

1143
01:01:34.58 --> 01:01:39.58
And so if you're going to- Swat was out for you.

1144
01:01:39.58 --> 01:01:41.58
Yeah, Swat's out because of me.

1145
01:01:41.58 --> 01:01:44.58
And I was interested in negotiation.

1146
01:01:44.58 --> 01:01:50.58
And what you do if they take you on the team, then they send you to Quantico for two weeks to get that training.

1147
01:01:50.58 --> 01:01:55.58
There's three schools in the world that every hostage negotiator wants to go to.

1148
01:01:55.58 --> 01:02:00.58
You want to go to the Bureau's school, you want to go to London, Matt, Scotland Yard.

1149
01:02:00.58 --> 01:02:04.58
And then you're either going to want to go down to Australia, you're going to want to go to Canada.

1150
01:02:04.58 --> 01:02:07.58
Because both of those run great courses.

1151
01:02:07.58 --> 01:02:13.58
So the Bureau's course, as opposed to the Scotland Yards course,

1152
01:02:13.58 --> 01:02:18.58
the Bureau's course will turn you into the best hostage negotiator you could be.

1153
01:02:18.58 --> 01:02:24.58
And the Scotland Yard turned you into a great team player, which I had no idea there was a difference then.

1154
01:02:24.58 --> 01:02:26.58
But there's a huge difference.

1155
01:02:26.58 --> 01:02:29.58
So I went to the Bureau's school and right now I'm negotiating.

1156
01:02:29.58 --> 01:02:32.58
So this is when you're still part of the gang task force.

1157
01:02:32.58 --> 01:02:35.58
You get this collateral duty as a negotiator.

1158
01:02:35.58 --> 01:02:40.58
So if something was to pop up where a negotiator was needed, they'd call- you'd get brought in.

1159
01:02:40.58 --> 01:02:44.58
Whereas some other guy that became a bomb tech, all of a sudden there's a bomb.

1160
01:02:44.58 --> 01:02:49.58
They're trying to pipe bomb somewhere, they need someone to go work on that, they call one of the bomb tech guys that's been to that school.

1161
01:02:49.58 --> 01:02:50.58
Exactly.

1162
01:02:50.58 --> 01:02:51.58
And so forth.

1163
01:02:51.58 --> 01:02:53.58
Okay, so you've been trained.

1164
01:02:53.58 --> 01:02:58.58
Now, once you've been trained in that, did you start to realize this is kind of something that you're good at?

1165
01:02:58.58 --> 01:03:01.58
Did you realize it was something you were more interested in than you thought you would be?

1166
01:03:01.58 --> 01:03:05.58
Well, I had volunteered on a suicide hotline before I went to the negotiation training.

1167
01:03:05.58 --> 01:03:07.58
Wait, you volunteered on what?

1168
01:03:07.58 --> 01:03:08.58
Suicide hotline.

1169
01:03:08.58 --> 01:03:09.58
Okay, got it.

1170
01:03:09.58 --> 01:03:15.58
So I was the hoop I had to jump through, because I went to the head of the negotiation team in New York.

1171
01:03:15.58 --> 01:03:18.58
I said, I want to be a hostage negotiator.

1172
01:03:18.58 --> 01:03:20.58
Oh, this is in the book, the one that you-

1173
01:03:20.58 --> 01:03:22.58
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1174
01:03:22.58 --> 01:03:30.58
And so I volunteered on a hotline, so then when I get to the Bureau's negotiation school and airplane tapes, I say to myself,

1175
01:03:30.58 --> 01:03:35.58
I've been doing this for a year and a half, I just didn't have a SWAT team outside.

1176
01:03:35.58 --> 01:03:42.58
So I've already felt that it was something that I was going to be good at and enjoyed while I was there.

1177
01:03:42.58 --> 01:03:45.58
How was that learning curve at the suicide hotline?

1178
01:03:45.58 --> 01:03:49.58
Yeah, it's really counter-intuitive.

1179
01:03:49.58 --> 01:03:52.58
I had, like, it's an invisible skill.

1180
01:03:52.58 --> 01:03:56.58
It's ridiculously effective, and it's completely invisible.

1181
01:03:56.58 --> 01:03:57.58
And you go to training for that?

1182
01:03:57.58 --> 01:03:58.58
Did they train you to be-

1183
01:03:58.58 --> 01:03:59.58
At the hotline?

1184
01:03:59.58 --> 01:04:00.58
Yeah.

1185
01:04:00.58 --> 01:04:04.58
Not only they train you, but at the beginning of the training,

1186
01:04:04.58 --> 01:04:09.58
they give you a piece of paper with 10 possible statements that somebody in the hotline might make.

1187
01:04:09.58 --> 01:04:12.58
So write down what you think are good responses.

1188
01:04:12.58 --> 01:04:15.58
They're going to give you back this piece of paper at the end of the training.

1189
01:04:15.58 --> 01:04:17.58
They give you back the piece of paper at the end of the training.

1190
01:04:17.58 --> 01:04:21.58
Now, I write like, it looks like I write with my feet.

1191
01:04:21.58 --> 01:04:23.58
My handwriting is very distinct.

1192
01:04:23.58 --> 01:04:25.58
Like, there's no way you can fake my handwriting.

1193
01:04:25.58 --> 01:04:28.58
So they hand me this piece of paper, and I know that's my handwriting.

1194
01:04:28.58 --> 01:04:34.58
And I remember thinking like, what moron wrote those responses?

1195
01:04:34.58 --> 01:04:38.58
That was how far they take you in two months, and you don't even know it.

1196
01:04:38.58 --> 01:04:46.58
What's an example of what you instinctively might think you should say to what you actually should say?

1197
01:04:46.58 --> 01:04:55.58
So, one call that I did get, this guy calls in and says, look, look, I'm just trying to put a lid on this night.

1198
01:04:55.58 --> 01:04:58.58
I'm trying to put a lid on this night.

1199
01:04:58.58 --> 01:05:04.58
Now, before training, I might have said, have you tried watching some TV?

1200
01:05:04.58 --> 01:05:07.58
Have you tried working out?

1201
01:05:07.58 --> 01:05:13.58
Like, when I'm really stressed, I know if I go get a good workout, it clears my head.

1202
01:05:13.58 --> 01:05:15.58
Or have you tried meditation?

1203
01:05:15.58 --> 01:05:18.58
Like jumping right into problem solving.

1204
01:05:18.58 --> 01:05:21.58
That is the wrong way to do it.

1205
01:05:21.58 --> 01:05:24.58
That will prolong the situation.

1206
01:05:24.58 --> 01:05:30.58
Like the speed accelerator, which is neuroscience based, I didn't know at the time,

1207
01:05:30.58 --> 01:05:33.58
is to deactivate the negatives by calling them out.

1208
01:05:33.58 --> 01:05:39.58
So I just say to this guy, because I've been taught to just like, call out what you're hearing.

1209
01:05:39.58 --> 01:05:41.58
So I go, he sounded frantic.

1210
01:05:41.58 --> 01:05:44.58
So I said, I'm sounding frantic.

1211
01:05:44.58 --> 01:05:51.58
And immediately his voice started coming down several notches, instantaneously.

1212
01:05:51.58 --> 01:05:56.58
And that tiny, like people listening to that conversation would be like,

1213
01:05:56.58 --> 01:06:03.58
what he, the guy, what he just said seems unhelpful.

1214
01:06:03.58 --> 01:06:11.58
However, if I'm watching the person that he said it to, instantaneously came down.

1215
01:06:11.58 --> 01:06:17.58
And since you don't see examples of that in real life, or on the movies or TV,

1216
01:06:17.58 --> 01:06:21.58
the guy'd say, look, if you tried working out.

1217
01:06:21.58 --> 01:06:27.58
And then on the movies or TV, they'll depict it as the other person saying,

1218
01:06:27.58 --> 01:06:29.58
like, wow, that's a great idea.

1219
01:06:29.58 --> 01:06:30.58
I'll do that.

1220
01:06:30.58 --> 01:06:33.58
So what's psychologically going through my head when I tell you,

1221
01:06:33.58 --> 01:06:36.58
I want to put a cap on this night, I got to put a cap on this night.

1222
01:06:36.58 --> 01:06:39.58
And you say, you say back to me, you sound like you're frantic.

1223
01:06:39.58 --> 01:06:43.58
What's going through my head that's making me deescalate?

1224
01:06:43.58 --> 01:06:49.58
Right, so it's probably a neurochemical reaction.

1225
01:06:49.58 --> 01:06:55.58
There's a, and from listening to Huberman and others, I'm fascinated by what's

1226
01:06:55.58 --> 01:06:57.58
finding the science behind it.

1227
01:06:57.58 --> 01:07:02.58
It's been duplicated in a number of experiments that if I put you in an fMRI,

1228
01:07:02.58 --> 01:07:05.58
where I can watch the electricity moving around in your brain,

1229
01:07:05.58 --> 01:07:10.58
and I show you a picture that induces some sort of negative thought.

1230
01:07:10.58 --> 01:07:13.58
And what the picture is, it doesn't matter.

1231
01:07:13.58 --> 01:07:15.58
The experiment's been done a number of times.

1232
01:07:15.58 --> 01:07:19.58
They might have shown them puppies in the rain, a starving child in Africa,

1233
01:07:19.58 --> 01:07:22.58
anything that would induce a negative thought.

1234
01:07:22.58 --> 01:07:29.58
And so seeing the picture, they watch areas in your brain light up that either

1235
01:07:29.58 --> 01:07:34.58
for you or predicted in advance where the negativity in your brain is housed.

1236
01:07:34.58 --> 01:07:37.58
That bounces around a little bit based on person,

1237
01:07:37.58 --> 01:07:42.58
but it's essentially about three quarters of the amygdala and a couple of other things

1238
01:07:42.58 --> 01:07:44.58
that are involved.

1239
01:07:44.58 --> 01:07:46.58
So they watch it light up when you see the picture.

1240
01:07:46.58 --> 01:07:49.58
Now they just say to you, what are you feeling?

1241
01:07:49.58 --> 01:07:53.58
Just asking you to label it, call it out, simply call it out.

1242
01:07:53.58 --> 01:07:59.58
And every time they ask a person to simply identify the negative emotion that they're feeling,

1243
01:07:59.58 --> 01:08:04.58
the electrical activity in the areas that had lit up start to diminish.

1244
01:08:04.58 --> 01:08:09.58
Every time, not sometimes, not 75% of the time, every time.

1245
01:08:09.58 --> 01:08:15.58
Now the amount they diminish changes, which is why I happen to hit the nail on the head

1246
01:08:15.58 --> 01:08:19.58
with this guy on a hotline, he starts coming down significantly.

1247
01:08:19.58 --> 01:08:25.58
Sometimes you can call out somebody's negative emotion and there won't be any perceivable response.

1248
01:08:25.58 --> 01:08:27.58
It doesn't mean it didn't work.

1249
01:08:27.58 --> 01:08:29.58
It means you just need to do it some more.

1250
01:08:29.58 --> 01:08:31.58
But it happens every time.

1251
01:08:31.58 --> 01:08:36.58
Now what triggers it is, is it a neurochemical response?

1252
01:08:36.58 --> 01:08:38.58
Is it a conscious response?

1253
01:08:38.58 --> 01:08:41.58
It's probably some sort of neurochemical response.

1254
01:08:41.58 --> 01:08:48.58
But what we learned in hostage negotiation and on the hotline, actually we do this extremely aggressively now

1255
01:08:48.58 --> 01:08:51.58
in all our business negotiations.

1256
01:08:51.58 --> 01:08:55.58
Like you know, I get some contentious to talk about.

1257
01:08:55.58 --> 01:09:01.58
I'm going to call you on a phone, send you a text, send you an email saying like,

1258
01:09:01.58 --> 01:09:03.58
yeah I like what I have to say.

1259
01:09:03.58 --> 01:09:05.58
You know, it's going to be harsh.

1260
01:09:05.58 --> 01:09:07.58
This is going to be insulting.

1261
01:09:07.58 --> 01:09:10.58
And so I started in a funny kind of way.

1262
01:09:10.58 --> 01:09:15.58
I started applying this when I'm running our international kidnap response.

1263
01:09:15.58 --> 01:09:20.58
I go to an embassy, there's a kidnap in the Philippines, I think you read about earlier.

1264
01:09:20.58 --> 01:09:28.58
I am unwelcome because somebody from Washington D.C. shows up, the locals in the embassy,

1265
01:09:28.58 --> 01:09:30.58
the message they get is they're screwing up.

1266
01:09:30.58 --> 01:09:33.58
You either screw it up or you're inadequate.

1267
01:09:33.58 --> 01:09:36.58
Somebody from D.C. is not welcome.

1268
01:09:36.58 --> 01:09:39.58
And I'm walking into a hostile environment every time.

1269
01:09:39.58 --> 01:09:44.58
And because they were new to it, they didn't know exactly the response, they'd usually be doing something wrong.

1270
01:09:44.58 --> 01:09:47.58
And I'd walk in, I'd start pointing out what they were doing wrong.

1271
01:09:47.58 --> 01:09:52.58
And my partner, Chuck Regini, who's in the story,

1272
01:09:52.58 --> 01:09:58.58
whenever we walk into a room, he would start to flinch because he knew that I was getting ready to lay into these guys.

1273
01:09:58.58 --> 01:10:03.58
And somewhere along the line, I learned to say before I started criticizing him,

1274
01:10:03.58 --> 01:10:07.58
I'd say, this is going to sound harsh.

1275
01:10:07.58 --> 01:10:09.58
And then I criticize him.

1276
01:10:09.58 --> 01:10:14.58
And they'd be, okay, they'd go from being mad

1277
01:10:14.58 --> 01:10:20.58
to, you know, it preempted the negativity by letting them know what was coming.

1278
01:10:20.58 --> 01:10:23.58
And I've seen it work on a regular basis.

1279
01:10:23.58 --> 01:10:26.58
Something about it makes it worse.

1280
01:10:26.58 --> 01:10:33.58
You could say, you could probably get away with saying this in a Navy, in the teams.

1281
01:10:33.58 --> 01:10:39.58
You could say, you know, captain, this is going to, I don't want you to think I'm being disrespectful.

1282
01:10:39.58 --> 01:10:44.58
And you're probably not going to get to say the sentence second, second sentence,

1283
01:10:44.58 --> 01:10:47.58
or he's going to have shut you off.

1284
01:10:47.58 --> 01:10:52.58
But if instead you said, captain, I know this is going to sound disrespectful,

1285
01:10:52.58 --> 01:10:55.58
he'd sit down and listen to you.

1286
01:10:55.58 --> 01:10:58.58
He'd appreciate being warned.

1287
01:10:58.58 --> 01:11:04.58
And there's something about that reaction, that tiny little shift that'll learn way back on Hotline.

1288
01:11:04.58 --> 01:11:08.58
So you worked this suicide hotline for a year?

1289
01:11:08.58 --> 01:11:14.58
I was actively on the line for probably a little over two years, two and a half years.

1290
01:11:14.58 --> 01:11:20.58
I stayed very involved when the first trade center kicked off.

1291
01:11:20.58 --> 01:11:27.58
Then our follow on case, which was a larger broader conspiracy

1292
01:11:27.58 --> 01:11:32.58
on a couple of different groups that were all linked together.

1293
01:11:32.58 --> 01:11:38.58
Through the course of that following year, I just didn't have time to volunteer on a hotline anymore.

1294
01:11:38.58 --> 01:11:46.58
So this is kind of how you get started in this negotiation, learning this skill.

1295
01:11:46.58 --> 01:11:52.58
And I kind of told you this before we started recording, we're going to see all kinds of overlap

1296
01:11:52.58 --> 01:11:56.58
between what I talk about from a leadership perspective.

1297
01:11:56.58 --> 01:11:58.58
You know, there's a lot of skills that are transferred.

1298
01:11:58.58 --> 01:12:02.58
Like if you're good at baseball, there's a lot of things that are going to transfer over to softball.

1299
01:12:02.58 --> 01:12:08.58
If you're good at wrestling, there's a lot of things that are going to transfer over to, you know, Jiu Jitsu.

1300
01:12:08.58 --> 01:12:11.58
So there's a lot of stuff that's really, really similar.

1301
01:12:11.58 --> 01:12:14.58
And there's some differences as well.

1302
01:12:14.58 --> 01:12:22.58
But this skill of negotiation, as I read through the book, it's evolved a lot in the last 40, 50 years.

1303
01:12:22.58 --> 01:12:31.58
And, you know, some of the stuff that you talk about in the book, you know, hostage negotiation used to mean, you know,

1304
01:12:31.58 --> 01:12:34.58
stall them until we get a chance to assault.

1305
01:12:34.58 --> 01:12:36.58
Like that was what it was.

1306
01:12:36.58 --> 01:12:45.58
There was a mindset change that you outlined in the book that occurred around 1971.

1307
01:12:45.58 --> 01:12:47.58
October 1971, a guy named George Giff.

1308
01:12:47.58 --> 01:12:48.58
Am I saying that right?

1309
01:12:48.58 --> 01:12:55.58
He's a guy that took a plane, took a plane, took hostages on the plane.

1310
01:12:55.58 --> 01:12:58.58
The plane lands to refuel.

1311
01:12:58.58 --> 01:13:04.58
The hostages had actually negotiated their own release.

1312
01:13:04.58 --> 01:13:08.58
But the FBI got frustrated and shoots the engine of the plane.

1313
01:13:08.58 --> 01:13:11.58
The guy loses his mind, kills the hostages.

1314
01:13:11.58 --> 01:13:16.58
The FBI gets sued and actually loses the lawsuit.

1315
01:13:16.58 --> 01:13:23.58
So, so all of a sudden they realized they needed to make some adjustments to their, the way they're negotiating.

1316
01:13:23.58 --> 01:13:25.58
Right.

1317
01:13:25.58 --> 01:13:32.58
Another thing that you kind of detail in the book is 1979 Harvard starts this negotiation project.

1318
01:13:32.58 --> 01:13:37.58
And they're starting to look at negotiation theory and practice.

1319
01:13:37.58 --> 01:13:39.58
They're trying to improve it.

1320
01:13:39.58 --> 01:13:41.58
A book ends up coming out of that.

1321
01:13:41.58 --> 01:13:44.58
The book is called Getting to Yes.

1322
01:13:44.58 --> 01:13:51.58
That was written by Roger Fisher and William Urie, who were also the co-founders of that project.

1323
01:13:51.58 --> 01:14:03.58
And, and the theory that they had was that, look, the, you know, people are emotional and they're animalistic and they're unreliable and they're irrational.

1324
01:14:03.58 --> 01:14:05.58
And you just need to overcome that.

1325
01:14:05.58 --> 01:14:06.58
Right.

1326
01:14:06.58 --> 01:14:13.58
With, you know, rational, logical, you know, problem-solving mindset.

1327
01:14:13.58 --> 01:14:20.58
Which is, which is actually an idea that doesn't turn out to work so well.

1328
01:14:20.58 --> 01:14:21.58
Right.

1329
01:14:21.58 --> 01:14:25.58
Because it's a lot harder to overcome that irrational, emotional, animalistic human.

1330
01:14:25.58 --> 01:14:34.58
So those are some of the, those are some of the evolutions that start to take place when, in the book that you, that you run through.

1331
01:14:34.58 --> 01:14:42.58
And in fact, going to the book here, you say, you say this about their system was easy to follow and seductive with four basic tenets.

1332
01:14:42.58 --> 01:14:45.58
One, separate the person, the emotion from the problem.

1333
01:14:45.58 --> 01:14:49.58
Two, don't get wrapped up in the other side's position, what they're asking for.

1334
01:14:49.58 --> 01:14:52.58
But instead focus on their interests, why they're asking for it.

1335
01:14:52.58 --> 01:14:54.58
So you can find what they really want.

1336
01:14:54.58 --> 01:14:58.58
Three, work cooperatively to generate win-win options.

1337
01:14:58.58 --> 01:15:01.58
And four, I'm putting a little tone on those, aren't I?

1338
01:15:01.58 --> 01:15:02.58
Sorry.

1339
01:15:02.58 --> 01:15:08.58
And four, establish mutually agreed upon standards for evaluating those possible solutions.

1340
01:15:08.58 --> 01:15:13.58
So this is like one of those just detached academic things.

1341
01:15:13.58 --> 01:15:19.58
It was a brilliant rational and profound synthesis of the most advanced game theory and legal thinking of the day for years after that book came out.

1342
01:15:19.58 --> 01:15:26.58
Everybody, including the FBI and the NYPD focused on problem solving approach to bargaining interactions.

1343
01:15:26.58 --> 01:15:30.58
It just seemed so modern, modern and smart.

1344
01:15:30.58 --> 01:15:31.58
Right.

1345
01:15:31.58 --> 01:15:34.58
So that was what was kind of happening.

1346
01:15:34.58 --> 01:15:44.58
Then you go on to say halfway across the United States, a pair of professors at the University of Chicago was looking at everything from economics to negotiation from a far different angle.

1347
01:15:44.58 --> 01:15:49.58
They were economists, Amos Tversky, am I saying that right?

1348
01:15:49.58 --> 01:15:50.58
Tversky.

1349
01:15:50.58 --> 01:15:52.58
And psychologist Daniel Kahneman.

1350
01:15:52.58 --> 01:15:53.58
Kahneman.

1351
01:15:53.58 --> 01:15:54.58
Kahneman.

1352
01:15:54.58 --> 01:15:55.58
Kahneman, yeah.

1353
01:15:55.58 --> 01:15:57.58
And he wrote, thinking fast and slow.

1354
01:15:57.58 --> 01:16:07.58
Together, the two launched the field of behavioral economics and Kahneman won a Nobel Prize by showing that man is a very irrational beast.

1355
01:16:07.58 --> 01:16:08.58
Right.

1356
01:16:08.58 --> 01:16:12.58
Feeling they discovered is a form of thinking.

1357
01:16:12.58 --> 01:16:21.58
As you've seen when business schools like Harvard's began teaching negotiation in the 1980s, the process was presented as a straightforward economic analysis.

1358
01:16:21.58 --> 01:16:28.58
It was a period when the world's top academic economists declared that we were all rational actors.

1359
01:16:28.58 --> 01:16:30.58
That means on both sides.

1360
01:16:30.58 --> 01:16:33.58
That means considering that both people on both sides are rational.

1361
01:16:33.58 --> 01:16:40.58
And so it went into negotiation classes, assuming the other side was acting rationally and selfishly trying to maximize their position.

1362
01:16:40.58 --> 01:16:45.58
The goal was to figure out how to respond in various scenarios to maximize one's own value.

1363
01:16:45.58 --> 01:16:58.58
This mentality baffled Kahneman, who for years from years in psychology knew that in his words, quote, it is self-evident that people are neither fully rational nor completely selfish and that their tastes aren't anything but stable.

1364
01:16:58.58 --> 01:17:00.58
End quote.

1365
01:17:00.58 --> 01:17:05.58
So there were these two schools going on with negotiation.

1366
01:17:05.58 --> 01:17:16.58
And one of them took this kind of logical approach and the other one realized that you had to deal with these emotional, the emotions was a way of thinking you're gonna have some you're gonna have to deal with.

1367
01:17:16.58 --> 01:17:19.58
And you must have realized that on the suicide hotlines as well.

1368
01:17:19.58 --> 01:17:25.58
Yeah, you know, and I didn't really understand why all I knew is that taking that approach accelerated things.

1369
01:17:25.58 --> 01:17:30.58
Just complete acceleration and situations that I thought would have taken hours.

1370
01:17:30.58 --> 01:17:38.58
And so I just saw and again Kahneman and doesn't win the Nobel Prize like 2002 ish.

1371
01:17:38.58 --> 01:17:40.58
So just saw that it worked.

1372
01:17:40.58 --> 01:17:43.58
Didn't understand why I didn't really care.

1373
01:17:43.58 --> 01:17:53.58
All my first issue has always been what works now understanding a mechanism is important sometimes to people need to understand a mechanism.

1374
01:17:53.58 --> 01:17:56.58
Some people need to understand a mechanism.

1375
01:17:56.58 --> 01:18:00.58
I care about number one what works number two.

1376
01:18:00.58 --> 01:18:15.58
Secondarily is is it moral, you know, I missionaries and mercenaries in mercenaries if it works missionaries if it follows your basic moral code, if it qualifies on both of those and I'm good.

1377
01:18:15.58 --> 01:18:17.58
Got it.

1378
01:18:17.58 --> 01:18:31.58
Now you go into the book a little bit about how the FBI sort of started to adopt this, you know, the FBI, they were deep into that book at one point getting to yes, that was what they were using a lot of guys were using that.

1379
01:18:31.58 --> 01:18:38.58
But then you know you get Ruby Ridge up in Idaho, you get the the Waco, Texas, right?

1380
01:18:38.58 --> 01:18:44.58
These things are kind of does that these things are actually kind of does that they're very disastrous.

1381
01:18:44.58 --> 01:18:49.58
And you throw this in the book I'm going to go to the book here.

1382
01:18:49.58 --> 01:18:55.58
I mean, have you ever tried to devise a mutually beneficial win-win solution with a guy who thinks he's the Messiah.

1383
01:18:55.58 --> 01:19:09.58
It was becoming alarmingly obvious that getting to yes didn't work with kidnappers no matter how many agents read the book with highlighters in hands it failed to improve how we as hostage negotiators approach dealmaking.

1384
01:19:09.58 --> 01:19:14.58
There was clearly a breakdown between the books brilliant theory and everyday law enforcement experience.

1385
01:19:14.58 --> 01:19:25.58
Why was it that everyone had read this best selling business book and endorsed it as one of the greatest negotiators in text ever written and yet so few could follow it successfully.

1386
01:19:25.58 --> 01:19:28.58
Weren't we morons?

1387
01:19:28.58 --> 01:19:33.58
In 1994, fast forward a little bit from the book and again I'm reading excerpts for the book.

1388
01:19:33.58 --> 01:19:34.58
The book is awesome.

1389
01:19:34.58 --> 01:19:36.58
I mean we're hitting some wavedops.

1390
01:19:36.58 --> 01:19:38.58
So just order the book right now so you can get all these details.

1391
01:19:38.58 --> 01:19:58.58
In 1994 FBI director Louis Free announced Louis Free announced the form the formation of the critical incident response group a blended division that would combine crisis negotiation crisis management behavioral sciences and host address you teams and reinvent crisis negotiation.

1392
01:19:58.58 --> 01:20:18.58
The only issue was what techniques were we going to use and you go on to say what were needed were simply were simple psychological tactics and strategies that worked in the field to calm people down established rapport gain trust elicit verbalization of needs and persuade the other guy of our of our empathy.

1393
01:20:18.58 --> 01:20:22.58
We needed something that was easy to teach easy to learn and easy to execute.

1394
01:20:22.58 --> 01:20:30.58
In the early years the FBI experimented with both new and old therapeutic techniques developed and by the counseling profession.

1395
01:20:30.58 --> 01:20:39.58
These counseling skills were aimed at developing positive relationships with people by demonstrating an understanding of what they're going through and how they feel about it.

1396
01:20:39.58 --> 01:20:44.58
It all starts with the universally applicable premise that people want to be understood and accepted.

1397
01:20:44.58 --> 01:20:47.58
And by the way, again, I talked about like leadership.

1398
01:20:47.58 --> 01:20:56.58
This is exactly what I talk about from a leadership perspective. I mean, if you don't know me at all, I'm absolutely trying to get you to trust me. How do I get you to trust me?

1399
01:20:56.58 --> 01:21:01.58
I put some trust in you. I listen to what you have to say. You're going to listen to me. Same exact thing here.

1400
01:21:01.58 --> 01:21:13.58
Back to the book listening is the cheapest yet most most effective concession we can make to get there by listening intensely a negotiator demonstrates empathy and shows a sincere desire to better understand what the other side is experiencing.

1401
01:21:13.58 --> 01:21:22.58
Exactly why you listen to your subordinates. Exactly why you listen to your peers. Exactly why you listen to your boss. What are you trying to tell me, boss? Let me listen.

1402
01:21:22.58 --> 01:21:30.58
Whenever I get asked the question, you know, my team is not listening to me. What should I do? Yell louder.

1403
01:21:30.58 --> 01:21:37.58
It's like, no, you want your team to listen to you, listen to them. Be quiet, listen to them. Hear what they have to say.

1404
01:21:37.58 --> 01:21:50.58
You go on to say psychotherapy research shows that when individuals feel listened to, they tend to listen to themselves more carefully and openly evaluate and clarify their own thoughts and feelings.

1405
01:21:50.58 --> 01:22:05.58
In addition, they tend to become less defensive and oppositional and more willing to listen to other points of view, which gets them to calm to the calm and logical place where they can be good getting to yes problem solvers.

1406
01:22:05.58 --> 01:22:21.58
So again, this is one of the things that I am talking about all the time with people. I always say, you know, if I'm if I want you to see something, if I want it, if I know the truth about something, if I've got some great plan and I want you on board with my plan,

1407
01:22:21.58 --> 01:22:33.58
the best thing I can do is not tell you what the plan is, is let you come up with a plan. Let you let the truth be revealed to you by you, not by me. That's my goal.

1408
01:22:33.58 --> 01:22:42.58
And you go on to say this whole concept, which you'll learn as the centerpiece of this book is called tactical empathy.

1409
01:22:42.58 --> 01:22:52.58
This is listening as a martial art, balancing the subtle behaviors of emotional intelligence and assertive skills of influence to gain access to the mind of the other person.

1410
01:22:52.58 --> 01:23:04.58
Contrary to popular opinion, listening is not a passive activity. It is the most active thing you can do. Once we started developing our new techniques, the negotiating world split into two concurrence, two currents.

1411
01:23:04.58 --> 01:23:11.58
Negotiation, as learned at the country's top school, continued down the established road of rational problem solving.

1412
01:23:11.58 --> 01:23:31.58
While ironically, we meet heads at the FBI began to train our agents in an unproven system based on psychology, counseling and crisis intervention. While the Ivy League taught math and economics, we became experts in empathy and our way worked.

1413
01:23:31.58 --> 01:23:35.58
So that's how the, that's how the shift, the shift took place.

1414
01:23:35.58 --> 01:23:42.58
Good stuff in that book. What book are you reading from again? That's good. I'm impressed. Who the hell wrote that?

1415
01:23:42.58 --> 01:23:54.58
Yeah, no, it's great. And I'm telling you, I mean, I just, I was really, really stoked to read it and got so much out of it, just seeing, you know, that whole section right there.

1416
01:23:54.58 --> 01:24:04.58
I mean, this is what I'm talking to people all the time about from a leadership perspective. You know, the big difference, the big difference between what when I talk about leadership.

1417
01:24:04.58 --> 01:24:13.58
And if you and I are negotiating, the big difference is as a leader, I don't really care at the end of the day what plan we use.

1418
01:24:13.58 --> 01:24:21.58
I just want the best plan. So I, I, you know, if we're going to attack a target at the end of the day, I don't care if we attack it from the north or from the south.

1419
01:24:21.58 --> 01:24:29.58
I just want which one is best. So I don't really have, I'm not trying to make you think something. I actually just want to find the best solution.

1420
01:24:29.58 --> 01:24:37.58
Now there's a chance that my solution is the best. There's a chance that your solution is the best. If I go and try and ram my solution down your throat, what are you going to do?

1421
01:24:37.58 --> 01:24:44.58
You're going to get defensive. We might not get to the best solution. If I hang on to my idea too tightly, we're not going to get the best solution.

1422
01:24:44.58 --> 01:24:52.58
So the main thing that I can do to help us get to the best solution, not to my solution, not to your solution, but just to the best solution.

1423
01:24:52.58 --> 01:25:01.58
The best thing for me to do is listen to what you have to say because I can't make you listen to me. I can't. But I can listen to you.

1424
01:25:01.58 --> 01:25:12.58
That's going to open up your mind. It's going to move us in the right direction. So that's, that's probably the, the big difference between the two is that when you're negotiating, you have a goal that you're trying to get to.

1425
01:25:12.58 --> 01:25:19.58
Well, here's what I'd add to that because that description is really the way we negotiate is we're just looking for the best deal.

1426
01:25:19.58 --> 01:25:31.58
Like you said, you're looking for the best plan. The real hard part in negotiating is your goal. You need to see it merely as a suggestion.

1427
01:25:31.58 --> 01:25:39.58
If you get too goal oriented, you get tunnel vision and you miss better answers. Never be so sure of what you want that you wouldn't take something better.

1428
01:25:39.58 --> 01:25:49.58
And by definition, you're never going to know the best possible outcome. It's not possible because the other side's holding stuff back.

1429
01:25:49.58 --> 01:25:58.58
You're holding stuff back, getting people to accept that intellectually is often really difficult with really experienced business people.

1430
01:25:58.58 --> 01:26:09.58
And I'll say, when are you not holding something back? Budgetary problems, pressures to make the deal, pressure to not make the deal, internal politics, personal pressures.

1431
01:26:09.58 --> 01:26:18.58
Is there ever a time you're not holding something back and no one ever said, I negotiate and I, I, I'm completely honest all the time.

1432
01:26:18.58 --> 01:26:31.58
Nobody ever says that. People are always holding stuff back. So if you are, they are too. And you're both holding back information that would change the course of the deal if revealed.

1433
01:26:31.58 --> 01:26:42.58
That's why you're holding it back. Now, so now what happens if you exponentialize this, so to speak? There's an overlap of the unknowns.

1434
01:26:42.58 --> 01:26:50.58
So it's impossible to know the best deal going in. It's not possible. But very few business people will accept that.

1435
01:26:50.58 --> 01:26:57.58
It is what it is. I know what it is I'm experienced. I know what the outcome is going to be. I know what they're being driven by.

1436
01:26:57.58 --> 01:27:02.58
You know, you are stroking your own ego when you say stuff like that.

1437
01:27:02.58 --> 01:27:17.58
Well, that, that means this stuff is even more in line with what I talk about. I think it's completely in line. The other thing that's interesting is, you know, and I forget if we'll cover this today, but I talk to business people and,

1438
01:27:17.58 --> 01:27:28.58
and occasionally, and it's usually it's very rare that, you know, you and I are working at a company and, and we can't come to a conclusion.

1439
01:27:28.58 --> 01:27:38.58
We can't come to an agreement. You want to do it this way. I want to do it that way. And when that happens, and the reason it happens so rarely in business is because if you and I work for the same company,

1440
01:27:38.58 --> 01:27:45.58
well, we both want to make money. We both want to take care of our client. We both want to take care of the team, right? Like we're ultimately aligned.

1441
01:27:45.58 --> 01:27:53.58
And so we we're trying to do something that's going to make us money and take care of the client and take care of our team. We're going to figure out a solution.

1442
01:27:53.58 --> 01:28:04.58
That's 99% of the time. 1% of the time you don't want to you either. You either don't want to help the client. You there's someone on the team you don't want to take care of.

1443
01:28:04.58 --> 01:28:10.58
There's some something going on where we're truly not aligned. Maybe you want to break off and start your own company. So you want us to fail.

1444
01:28:10.58 --> 01:28:17.58
And if it comes to a point where I'm saying, Chris, hold on a second. This is going to make us money. It's going to take care of our team. It's going to take care of the client.

1445
01:28:17.58 --> 01:28:26.58
And and we can't come to an agreement. That means we're not aligned. And you know, you talk about that. There are some deals where, you know, you want to sell the car and I want to buy the car.

1446
01:28:26.58 --> 01:28:36.58
But we just can't. There's no there's no possible way that we're going to do it because you want, you know, $30,000 for the car. And I literally can only pay $20,000.

1447
01:28:36.58 --> 01:28:55.58
It's not going to happen. We're not aligned. So that does occasionally happen. But yeah, it's it's it's very interesting that the meat heads at the FBI were the ones that started trying to listen and empathize and see the other people's perspective.

1448
01:28:55.58 --> 01:28:56.58
Right.

1449
01:28:56.58 --> 01:29:07.58
Let's get let's get into the book. And I'll tell you what, when I was reading the book, one thing that was a little bit tricky for me is as I was reading the book, I'm like, I want to read a bunch. You got you.

1450
01:29:07.58 --> 01:29:16.58
It's kind of written, you know, I've written a couple of books to and in my books, I tell the story, the combat story, the business story and then give the principle.

1451
01:29:16.58 --> 01:29:26.58
And that's what your book is to there's a lot of that. Hey, here's a combat story, an FBI story or a business story. And here's the negotiating principle that comes out of it.

1452
01:29:26.58 --> 01:29:35.58
And I kind of was going back and forth, you know, do I read a bunch of the stories because the stories are great. But I figured since you're here, it'd be great.

1453
01:29:35.58 --> 01:29:48.58
You know, I'm sure you'll tell some of those stories, but just to get into the techniques, the techniques, the negotiation techniques that you outlined in the book. And that's kind of what I decided to do.

1454
01:29:48.58 --> 01:29:55.58
May or may not have been the right decision. We're not sure yet. Maybe you'll have to come back just for pure story time.

1455
01:29:55.58 --> 01:30:09.58
But I wanted to get into the tactics that you talk about, because again, I think they're so prevalent. And at you know, in your intro to the book, you talk about negotiating being negotiation is life, you're negotiating all the time.

1456
01:30:09.58 --> 01:30:19.58
So these are things that you that everybody can use all the time. And the other thing is kind of like leadership. People think leadership, you either have it or you don't.

1457
01:30:19.58 --> 01:30:26.58
But really leadership is a bunch of skills that you can learn and negotiation. You know, how often you hear, oh, that guy is a great negotiator.

1458
01:30:26.58 --> 01:30:34.58
You hear that a lot or that guy is not a good negotiator negotiator. But what you don't realize is negotiation, just like basketball or just like playing guitar.

1459
01:30:34.58 --> 01:30:41.58
There's a bunch of skills that you can learn. There's a bunch of moves that you can make. And once you know those skills, once you know those moves, you can utilize them.

1460
01:30:41.58 --> 01:30:52.58
And so this book, awesome book for pointing out some of these tactics, techniques and procedures. So let's get into a little bit.

1461
01:30:52.58 --> 01:30:58.58
The first technique that you talk about or the first one that I'm going to highlight is called mirroring.

1462
01:30:58.58 --> 01:31:00.58
Yeah.

1463
01:31:00.58 --> 01:31:05.58
And you say mirroring also called isopraxism. Is that right?

1464
01:31:05.58 --> 01:31:07.58
It's a lot of syllables in that word.

1465
01:31:07.58 --> 01:31:18.58
Luckily, we've only got in here once. I don't have to say it again is essentially imitation. It's another neuro behavior that humans and other animals display in which we copy each other to comfort each other.

1466
01:31:18.58 --> 01:31:26.58
It can be done with speech patterns, body language, vocabulary, tempo, tone of voice. It generally it's generally an unconscious behavior.

1467
01:31:26.58 --> 01:31:35.58
We're rarely aware of when it's happening, but it's a sign that people are bonding in sync and establishing the kind of rapport that leads to trust.

1468
01:31:35.58 --> 01:31:41.58
It's a phenomenon and now a technique that falls a very basic but profound biological principle.

1469
01:31:41.58 --> 01:31:53.58
We fear what's different and are drawn to what's similar as the same goes birds of a feather flock together mirroring then when practice consciously is the art of insinuating similarity.

1470
01:31:53.58 --> 01:31:59.58
Trust me, a mirror signals to another unconscious. You and I, we're alike.

1471
01:31:59.58 --> 01:32:06.58
Once you're attuned to the dynamic, you'll see it everywhere. Couples walking on the street with their steps in perfect synchronicity.

1472
01:32:06.58 --> 01:32:11.58
Friends in conversation at a park both nodding their head and crossing legs at about the same time.

1473
01:32:11.58 --> 01:32:18.58
These people in a word are connected while mirroring is most often associated with forms of nonverbal communication, especially body language.

1474
01:32:18.58 --> 01:32:27.58
As negotiators, a mirror focuses on the words and nothing else, not the body language, not the accent, not the tone or delivery, just the words.

1475
01:32:27.58 --> 01:32:39.58
It's almost laughably simple. For the FBI, a mirror is when you repeat the last three words or the critical one to three words of what someone just said.

1476
01:32:39.58 --> 01:32:47.58
Of the entirety of the FBI's hostage negotiation skill set, mirroring is the closest one gets to a Jedi mind trick.

1477
01:32:47.58 --> 01:32:56.58
Simple yet uncannily effective. By repeating back what people say you trigger this mirroring instinct and your counterpart will inevitably elaborate on what was just said and sustained.

1478
01:32:56.58 --> 01:33:08.58
The process of connecting. Psychologist Richard Wiseman created a study using waiters to identify what was more effective, what the more effective method of creating a connection with strangers.

1479
01:33:08.58 --> 01:33:20.58
Mirroring or positive reinforcement. One group of waiters using positive reinforcement lavish praise and encouragement on patrons using the word such as great, no problem and sure in response to each order.

1480
01:33:20.58 --> 01:33:27.58
The other group of waiters mirrored their customers simply by repeating their orders back to them. The results were stunning.

1481
01:33:27.58 --> 01:33:34.58
The average tip of the waiters who mirrored was 70% more than those who use positive reinforcement.

1482
01:33:34.58 --> 01:33:37.58
So that's pretty amazing.

1483
01:33:37.58 --> 01:33:38.58
It's nuts, isn't it?

1484
01:33:38.58 --> 01:33:39.58
Yeah.

1485
01:33:39.58 --> 01:33:45.58
You point out later in the book that it can feel weird to mirror when you first start doing it.

1486
01:33:45.58 --> 01:33:47.58
Yeah, it feels weird to everybody pretty much.

1487
01:33:47.58 --> 01:33:53.58
Yeah, it feels weird to everybody. I don't know why that is. Maybe because it seems so obvious to the user.

1488
01:33:53.58 --> 01:33:55.58
It seems obvious.

1489
01:33:55.58 --> 01:34:02.58
Yeah, you know, I feel like saying some more based on what you're doing.

1490
01:34:02.58 --> 01:34:06.58
Yeah, it's just...

1491
01:34:06.58 --> 01:34:11.58
And that's one of the ones... Again, I was talking about Hubertman before.

1492
01:34:11.58 --> 01:34:17.58
Like, if I could get him to do a ton of experiments, like, try this, try this, try this, I got to find out this.

1493
01:34:17.58 --> 01:34:22.58
And that'd be one of them as to what makes a mirror work so effectively with so many people.

1494
01:34:22.58 --> 01:34:26.58
And it does. And then who's attracted to it?

1495
01:34:26.58 --> 01:34:29.58
I find interesting who's attracted to it.

1496
01:34:29.58 --> 01:34:33.58
And then I also find it's different circuits in the brain.

1497
01:34:33.58 --> 01:34:40.58
Like, the majority of the people on my team, we get really good at labeling.

1498
01:34:40.58 --> 01:34:50.58
And I find, as a performance skill, then in myself and others, we might not mirror enough.

1499
01:34:50.58 --> 01:34:56.58
And then those that are really attracted to mirroring, and will use it almost exclusively,

1500
01:34:56.58 --> 01:35:03.58
like, what is it that makes you tick, that makes you like that mirroring so much?

1501
01:35:03.58 --> 01:35:11.58
And I think they're attracted to the simplicity of it, and then they're not offended by simple concepts,

1502
01:35:11.58 --> 01:35:17.58
which actually in many cases takes a more sophisticated approach to really like simple stuff.

1503
01:35:17.58 --> 01:35:23.58
And I'm seeing regularly, people that really are mirroring as a sophisticated skill,

1504
01:35:23.58 --> 01:35:31.58
and if somebody rejects it off the top of their head, I think you're worried about appearing stupid.

1505
01:35:31.58 --> 01:35:38.58
And if you're so confident in your intelligence that you got no problem looking stupid,

1506
01:35:38.58 --> 01:35:41.58
then you're happy to mirror.

1507
01:35:41.58 --> 01:35:49.58
One piece of advice that I give to people is when Chris rolls into my office and you're pissed about something,

1508
01:35:49.58 --> 01:35:55.58
I got to talk to you right now. One thing I tell people is like, cool, I get out my notebook,

1509
01:35:55.58 --> 01:35:58.58
get out my pen, and like, what's going on, Chris, talk to me.

1510
01:35:58.58 --> 01:36:03.58
And to me, that's showing you that I'm listening to what you have to say, and I'm taking it seriously.

1511
01:36:03.58 --> 01:36:07.58
And it seems like mirroring is another way of doing it.

1512
01:36:07.58 --> 01:36:13.58
If you're repeating what I'm saying, then I'm like, oh, he's paying attention to me, he's listening to me.

1513
01:36:13.58 --> 01:36:18.58
You're proving that you're listening to the person, which also is a really positive thing.

1514
01:36:18.58 --> 01:36:25.58
Never mind the whole psychological connection that we're making, just the fact that when I'm repeating what you're saying back to you,

1515
01:36:25.58 --> 01:36:28.58
it shows you I'm listening to what you're saying.

1516
01:36:28.58 --> 01:36:30.58
Right.

1517
01:36:30.58 --> 01:36:37.58
I often, when I talk about listening and how important it is, people don't realize how important it is.

1518
01:36:37.58 --> 01:36:43.58
And I think one of the ways that I use to explain how important it is is I use the opposite,

1519
01:36:43.58 --> 01:36:49.58
which is if you're talking and I cut you off, everyone knows that's disrespectful. Everybody knows it.

1520
01:36:49.58 --> 01:36:53.58
It's like a sign of disrespect. If someone's talking, I jump in there and cut them off.

1521
01:36:53.58 --> 01:36:55.58
If they're not listening to me, that's being disrespectful.

1522
01:36:55.58 --> 01:36:59.58
The opposite of that is when I actually listen to what you have to say.

1523
01:36:59.58 --> 01:37:03.58
And now we've got a little technique to prove to you that I'm listening to what you say.

1524
01:37:03.58 --> 01:37:06.58
I'm going to mirror those last couple words back to you.

1525
01:37:06.58 --> 01:37:08.58
Right.

1526
01:37:08.58 --> 01:37:11.58
There's no doubt that you got the words if you repeat them back.

1527
01:37:11.58 --> 01:37:17.58
Nice little technique.

1528
01:37:17.58 --> 01:37:20.58
Moving on a little bit.

1529
01:37:20.58 --> 01:37:24.58
Again, we're hitting the highlights of this book. You got to get the book.

1530
01:37:24.58 --> 01:37:29.58
The book is definitely going to leave a mark on your brain.

1531
01:37:29.58 --> 01:37:31.58
So get the book. In a good way.

1532
01:37:31.58 --> 01:37:36.58
Yes, in a good way. Not psychological damage, but in a positive way.

1533
01:37:36.58 --> 01:37:38.58
I'm going to fast forward a little bit here.

1534
01:37:38.58 --> 01:37:42.58
The language of negotiation is primarily a language of conversation and rapport.

1535
01:37:42.58 --> 01:37:48.58
A way of quickly establishing relationships and getting people to talk and think together.

1536
01:37:48.58 --> 01:37:50.58
Here are some key lessons from this chapter.

1537
01:37:50.58 --> 01:37:56.58
Remember a good negotiator negotiator prepares going in to be ready for possible surprises.

1538
01:37:56.58 --> 01:38:02.58
A great negotiator aims to use her skills to reveal the surprises.

1539
01:38:02.58 --> 01:38:08.58
She is certain to find my note next to that was role play.

1540
01:38:08.58 --> 01:38:16.58
How often are we role playing if we're negotiating?

1541
01:38:16.58 --> 01:38:18.58
What do you mean?

1542
01:38:18.58 --> 01:38:22.58
Let's say from a leadership perspective, it's you and me.

1543
01:38:22.58 --> 01:38:25.58
We're peers and I go, hey, Chris, I got to go meet with Echo.

1544
01:38:25.58 --> 01:38:29.58
You know how he's all mad about us cutting his hours?

1545
01:38:29.58 --> 01:38:31.58
I'm going to go talk to him right now. I know he's pissed.

1546
01:38:31.58 --> 01:38:33.58
Can we run through this a couple of times?

1547
01:38:33.58 --> 01:38:35.58
So I'm just going to role play.

1548
01:38:35.58 --> 01:38:38.58
So that way I think about what could Echo possibly say.

1549
01:38:38.58 --> 01:38:42.58
He might get mad about this. He might talk about his family.

1550
01:38:42.58 --> 01:38:48.58
He might talk about how long he's been here and I want to kind of have some contingency plans here, right?

1551
01:38:48.58 --> 01:38:54.58
To do what you said, prepare, be ready for possible surprises and actually be ready to take those surprises.

1552
01:38:54.58 --> 01:38:57.58
And when he says, you know, what about my family?

1553
01:38:57.58 --> 01:39:00.58
And I said, well, the important thing is, Echo, I know we got to give you some less hours right now.

1554
01:39:00.58 --> 01:39:03.58
But the main thing I want to do is keep you here.

1555
01:39:03.58 --> 01:39:06.58
The only way you can do that is if we cut back your hours a little bit.

1556
01:39:06.58 --> 01:39:10.58
It's hopefully going to be temporary. It should be when the market picks back up.

1557
01:39:10.58 --> 01:39:12.58
Are we in an actual negotiation?

1558
01:39:12.58 --> 01:39:15.58
See what I'm going here? Echo's not in his head. He's kind of on board.

1559
01:39:15.58 --> 01:39:17.58
Let's take care of the family.

1560
01:39:17.58 --> 01:39:19.58
What are you thinking? I got more free time.

1561
01:39:19.58 --> 01:39:21.58
We'll have some more.

1562
01:39:21.58 --> 01:39:23.58
So there you go. You know, there's another point.

1563
01:39:23.58 --> 01:39:27.58
Hey, now's a little time to make all those baseball games you got to make.

1564
01:39:27.58 --> 01:39:31.58
So that's a point that you made role play something that we did.

1565
01:39:31.58 --> 01:39:33.58
What we do with our clients all the time.

1566
01:39:33.58 --> 01:39:35.58
Right.

1567
01:39:35.58 --> 01:39:37.58
If you're with a good role player.

1568
01:39:37.58 --> 01:39:39.58
Right. Great tool.

1569
01:39:39.58 --> 01:39:46.58
Who has dialed in enough emotional intelligence to make some good predictions for you.

1570
01:39:46.58 --> 01:39:49.58
It's probably not bad. Even if they're not good at it.

1571
01:39:49.58 --> 01:39:53.58
You just got to make sure that that's not exactly the way you expect it to go down.

1572
01:39:53.58 --> 01:39:55.58
Yep. Yep.

1573
01:39:55.58 --> 01:39:58.58
All right. So this is a possibility. Now this is how it's going to happen.

1574
01:39:58.58 --> 01:40:00.58
Definitely.

1575
01:40:00.58 --> 01:40:05.58
You say don't commit to assumptions. Instead view them as a hypothesis.

1576
01:40:05.58 --> 01:40:09.58
And use the negotiation to test them rigorously.

1577
01:40:09.58 --> 01:40:17.58
To me, my note I wrote down on this one was the most important characteristic for a leader to me is to be humble.

1578
01:40:17.58 --> 01:40:22.58
And if you're not humble, you know, I go in thinking I'm right, you're wrong.

1579
01:40:22.58 --> 01:40:25.58
Or I'm just right. It doesn't even matter what you are because I know I'm right.

1580
01:40:25.58 --> 01:40:27.58
Right.

1581
01:40:27.58 --> 01:40:31.58
This word of the way you put it, viewing your ideas as a hypothesis.

1582
01:40:31.58 --> 01:40:33.58
Are you my plan? It's beautiful.

1583
01:40:33.58 --> 01:40:38.58
Yeah. And that is one that 1000% I'll attribute to my son Brandon.

1584
01:40:38.58 --> 01:40:44.58
Because he we'd be talking about this developing it after I left the FBI and kicking the ideas around.

1585
01:40:44.58 --> 01:40:47.58
And he'd have an insider. He'd say something.

1586
01:40:47.58 --> 01:40:52.58
And I know that using the word hypothesis in our vernacular came from him.

1587
01:40:52.58 --> 01:40:58.58
And it's a good word when you're going into a discussion with somebody.

1588
01:40:58.58 --> 01:41:00.58
Don't say this is my idea.

1589
01:41:00.58 --> 01:41:05.58
Say this is just a hypothesis. It's one I came up with. Could be right. Could be wrong.

1590
01:41:05.58 --> 01:41:06.58
Let's see where it's at.

1591
01:41:06.58 --> 01:41:13.58
You say people who view negotiation as a battle of arguments become overwhelmed by the voices in their head.

1592
01:41:13.58 --> 01:41:18.58
Negotiation is not an active battle. It's a process of discovery.

1593
01:41:18.58 --> 01:41:22.58
The goal is to uncover as much information as possible.

1594
01:41:22.58 --> 01:41:24.58
And that goes back to what we already talked about.

1595
01:41:24.58 --> 01:41:27.58
I'm looking for the best way of doing it. You're looking for a deal that works.

1596
01:41:27.58 --> 01:41:31.58
Best deal. Best plan. What's the difference right?

1597
01:41:31.58 --> 01:41:40.58
To quiet the voices in your head. Make your soul and all encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say.

1598
01:41:40.58 --> 01:41:43.58
Which means we're listening.

1599
01:41:43.58 --> 01:41:50.58
The most underrated tool of leadership is listening.

1600
01:41:50.58 --> 01:41:58.58
Slow it down. Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making.

1601
01:41:58.58 --> 01:42:01.58
If we're in too much of a hurry people can feel as if they're not being heard.

1602
01:42:01.58 --> 01:42:06.58
You risk undermining the rapport and trust you've built.

1603
01:42:06.58 --> 01:42:10.58
Gotta get used to that silence.

1604
01:42:10.58 --> 01:42:23.58
And you talk about it in here. Many, many people are uncomfortable with silence.

1605
01:42:23.58 --> 01:42:27.58
Yeah, for a variety of reasons.

1606
01:42:27.58 --> 01:42:34.58
It's just happened in the last 72 hours, last few days.

1607
01:42:34.58 --> 01:42:39.58
What I love about what I do for a living now is I get into interesting conversations with people.

1608
01:42:39.58 --> 01:42:44.58
With fascinating people that I just like aspire to be in the same room with.

1609
01:42:44.58 --> 01:42:50.58
So Ari Emanuel. That Ari from Hollywood.

1610
01:42:50.58 --> 01:42:57.58
The character on enthrallage is based around.

1611
01:42:57.58 --> 01:42:59.58
So he gives me a call and he wants to talk about something.

1612
01:42:59.58 --> 01:43:04.58
And he says, speakers bureau, Don Walker runs it. We'll get on the phone with him.

1613
01:43:04.58 --> 01:43:09.58
Cool. So I get on the phone with Don and Ari at the same time.

1614
01:43:09.58 --> 01:43:16.58
And Don has done his homework. But he's one of those guys that's not comfortable with silence.

1615
01:43:16.58 --> 01:43:22.58
So fortunately he's so smart about what he's doing and he's done it for so long.

1616
01:43:22.58 --> 01:43:26.58
That everything that's coming out of his mouth is exactly what I'm thinking.

1617
01:43:26.58 --> 01:43:34.58
However, I've done a talk a couple of times that you get seven to 10 seconds to get somebody's attention or you'll lose it.

1618
01:43:34.58 --> 01:43:39.58
And so he starts out by saying, I know I got seven to 10 seconds to get your attention.

1619
01:43:39.58 --> 01:43:45.58
And he must have talked for about three minutes and finally Ari goes, that's the longest seven seconds I've ever heard in my life.

1620
01:43:45.58 --> 01:43:50.58
Because Don just couldn't stop talking.

1621
01:43:50.58 --> 01:43:56.58
Next one, put a smile on your face.

1622
01:43:56.58 --> 01:44:02.58
When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly and are more likely to collaborate and problem solve instead of fight and resist.

1623
01:44:02.58 --> 01:44:07.58
Positivity creates mental agility in both you and your counterpart. All good stuff.

1624
01:44:07.58 --> 01:44:11.58
Now you got you go into this section here and you talk about it in the book already you tell.

1625
01:44:11.58 --> 01:44:20.58
And again, I'm skipping the stories that you wrap around these where people can get the examples of what you did and where you use these.

1626
01:44:20.58 --> 01:44:24.58
So get the book so you can get some of those examples.

1627
01:44:24.58 --> 01:44:29.58
Three voice tones available to negotiators.

1628
01:44:29.58 --> 01:44:32.58
Number one, the late night FM DJ voice.

1629
01:44:32.58 --> 01:44:37.58
You selectively to make a point and flex your voice downward keeping it calm and slow.

1630
01:44:37.58 --> 01:44:46.58
When done properly, you create an aura of authority and trustworthiness without triggering defensiveness.

1631
01:44:46.58 --> 01:44:49.58
Number two, the positive playful voice.

1632
01:44:49.58 --> 01:44:51.58
This should be your default voice.

1633
01:44:51.58 --> 01:44:53.58
It's a voice of an easy going good natured person.

1634
01:44:53.58 --> 01:44:55.58
Your attitude is light and encouraging.

1635
01:44:55.58 --> 01:44:59.58
The key here is to relax and smile while you're talking.

1636
01:44:59.58 --> 01:45:06.58
Number three, the direct or assertive voice use rarely will cause problems and create pushback.

1637
01:45:06.58 --> 01:45:15.58
We did a podcast a while ago on something called psychological reactants.

1638
01:45:15.58 --> 01:45:21.58
And what this is is the instinct that everyone has that when I tell you to do something, you don't want to do it.

1639
01:45:21.58 --> 01:45:22.58
Right.

1640
01:45:22.58 --> 01:45:28.58
It's just a natural reaction that everybody has and it causes that's what allows reverse psychology to work.

1641
01:45:28.58 --> 01:45:31.58
Because when I say, oh, Chris, you can't do this.

1642
01:45:31.58 --> 01:45:33.58
You go, if I can, right?

1643
01:45:33.58 --> 01:45:38.58
When I say you couldn't paint that fence all by yourself, you go, yes, I couldn't.

1644
01:45:38.58 --> 01:45:41.58
You go do it.

1645
01:45:41.58 --> 01:45:48.58
So that direct voice is something to watch out for.

1646
01:45:48.58 --> 01:45:51.58
Moving on to this next section.

1647
01:45:51.58 --> 01:45:59.58
And you already mentioned this, the idea of labeling.

1648
01:45:59.58 --> 01:46:03.58
You say, don't feel their pain, label it.

1649
01:46:03.58 --> 01:46:07.58
Emotions are one of the main things that derail communication.

1650
01:46:07.58 --> 01:46:12.58
Once people get upset at one another, rational thinking goes out the window.

1651
01:46:12.58 --> 01:46:18.58
That's why instead of denying or ignoring emotions, good negotiators identify and influence them.

1652
01:46:18.58 --> 01:46:24.58
They are able to precisely label emotions, those of others and especially their own.

1653
01:46:24.58 --> 01:46:29.58
And once they label the emotions, they talk about them without getting wound up.

1654
01:46:29.58 --> 01:46:30.58
For them, emotion is a tool.

1655
01:46:30.58 --> 01:46:32.58
Emotions aren't obstacles, they are a means.

1656
01:46:32.58 --> 01:46:38.58
The relationship between an emotionally intelligent negotiator and their counterpart is essentially therapeutic.

1657
01:46:38.58 --> 01:46:41.58
It duplicates that of a psychotherapist with a patient.

1658
01:46:41.58 --> 01:46:51.58
The psychotherapist pokes and prots to understand his patient's problems and then turns the responses back onto the patient to get him to go deeper and change his behavior.

1659
01:46:51.58 --> 01:46:54.58
That's exactly what good negotiators do.

1660
01:46:54.58 --> 01:47:01.58
Getting to this level of emotional intelligence demands opening up your senses, talking less and listening more.

1661
01:47:01.58 --> 01:47:14.58
You can learn almost everything you need and a lot more than other people would like you to know simply by watching and listening, keeping your eyes peeled, your ears open and your mouth shut.

1662
01:47:14.58 --> 01:47:16.58
Talk to me about labeling a little bit.

1663
01:47:16.58 --> 01:47:17.58
How are we using it?

1664
01:47:17.58 --> 01:47:19.58
What does it look like?

1665
01:47:19.58 --> 01:47:21.58
Simple again.

1666
01:47:21.58 --> 01:47:23.58
It seems like it sounds like it looks like.

1667
01:47:23.58 --> 01:47:25.58
It seems like something's bothering you.

1668
01:47:25.58 --> 01:47:28.58
It seems like you don't know when you're going to need me.

1669
01:47:28.58 --> 01:47:31.58
It seems like you're giving this a lot of thought.

1670
01:47:31.58 --> 01:47:33.58
Just hanging a label on something.

1671
01:47:33.58 --> 01:47:39.58
It hits the brain in a different way than anything else does.

1672
01:47:39.58 --> 01:47:47.58
And even questions like me and another guy, Steve Scholl, we're doing a lot of stuff with the real estate agency these days.

1673
01:47:47.58 --> 01:47:52.58
We're still coming out for residential real estate agents in about two months.

1674
01:47:52.58 --> 01:47:55.58
What is the name of the book so everyone can pre-order it?

1675
01:47:55.58 --> 01:47:57.58
The full fee agent.

1676
01:47:57.58 --> 01:47:59.58
Okay.

1677
01:47:59.58 --> 01:48:07.58
And the agents we coach, for example, you go through an open house, you walk around, you look around, and the agent says to you on the way out the door,

1678
01:48:07.58 --> 01:48:18.58
would you see that you liked? Basically, pretty good question as questions go, starts with the word what, not a great way, good word to start question with, calibrated question, if you will.

1679
01:48:18.58 --> 01:48:25.58
And people stop and think, and they go like, oh, well, you know, we kind of like the kitchen.

1680
01:48:25.58 --> 01:48:27.58
They'll give you a thoughtful answer.

1681
01:48:27.58 --> 01:48:33.58
Same scenario, somebody is walking out the door, the agent says, seems like you saw some stuff you liked.

1682
01:48:33.58 --> 01:48:38.58
Oh, yeah, look, I can tell you something. We were looking at the bedroom and we could see our daughter in there.

1683
01:48:38.58 --> 01:48:47.58
And, you know, the backyard is perfect for the way our kids are, like, a complete download of what's going through somebody's brain.

1684
01:48:47.58 --> 01:49:02.58
Like, just straight, like, from layman's perspective, bypassing the prefrontal cortex entirely, shoving up, listening device in the side of your head and hearing what's going on in your head.

1685
01:49:02.58 --> 01:49:10.58
Another example, in the labels, when you're exhausted, when you're tired, it's hard to give a good answer.

1686
01:49:10.58 --> 01:49:21.58
So I'm on my way back from a trip to the UAE a couple of months ago, and I'm in Seattle waiting to get on a plane and I'm exhausted.

1687
01:49:21.58 --> 01:49:25.58
Shoot a text to a buddy. Take care of this.

1688
01:49:25.58 --> 01:49:34.58
Now, he could have come back at me with a good question, what makes you ask, to make sure they were aligned.

1689
01:49:34.58 --> 01:49:40.58
But instead, he texts me back, seems like you have a reason for asking.

1690
01:49:40.58 --> 01:49:46.58
Now, I was so tired at that point in time that I saw the difference. Seems like you have a reason for asking.

1691
01:49:46.58 --> 01:49:51.58
I must have thrown back at him a ten-line text, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

1692
01:49:51.58 --> 01:50:01.58
And then afterwards, I thought, if he just said what makes you ask, I was tired enough that I thought, you know, just, I'd have texted him back, just do it, stop bothering me.

1693
01:50:01.58 --> 01:50:14.58
There's something about the way the label hits the brain that there's a complete mental change in the response and the amount of information you get out of somebody.

1694
01:50:14.58 --> 01:50:33.58
It seems like we're danger close on this one to the borderline catastrophic mistake that we can make, which is you come into my office, you're all mad, and I look at you and say, calm down, you're mad.

1695
01:50:33.58 --> 01:50:40.58
So the difference here is it seems like you're really mad about this.

1696
01:50:40.58 --> 01:50:50.58
Yeah. Well, it seems like this is important because the great skill works with your boss also.

1697
01:50:50.58 --> 01:50:59.58
He's one of the students in my class at Georgetown. Boss comes by, come on, we got to go right now. We got something we got to take care of right now.

1698
01:50:59.58 --> 01:51:08.58
He called it the boss drive-by. Now, we is you. We got something we got to do right now. That means I got something for you to do right now.

1699
01:51:08.58 --> 01:51:21.58
And he's in a really, he's loud about it, you know, so this guy gets drug into his boss's office and immediately says, sounds like this is important.

1700
01:51:21.58 --> 01:51:28.58
Well, the boss is coming at you like that because it is important, which is the first thing he wants or she wants you to understand.

1701
01:51:28.58 --> 01:51:38.58
So if you demonstrate sounds like this is important right away, boss immediately comes down three notches, starts thinking things through.

1702
01:51:38.58 --> 01:51:45.58
If somebody's angry, you know, sounds like this is made you angry sounds like this is important. Sounds like this is upsetting.

1703
01:51:45.58 --> 01:51:54.58
You want him to come down several notches. See, the lizard brain is out of the driver's seat and the human brain is back in, right?

1704
01:51:54.58 --> 01:52:08.58
I got a this book here, Leadership Strategy and Tactics. I talk about one of the tactics I talk about. I call it reflect and diminish, which means when Chris comes into my office and he goes, I can't believe the supply department didn't get this stuff here on time.

1705
01:52:08.58 --> 01:52:17.58
What I do is reflect some of that anger, but I diminish it. So I say, are you serious? It didn't show up yet.

1706
01:52:17.58 --> 01:52:32.58
How much gear is it that you're missing? So immediately I show you that I'm on your side. I show you that I'm also mad about it, but we start moving towards a solution as opposed to like, you need to calm down before you come in here or hey, you need to take ownership of this.

1707
01:52:32.58 --> 01:52:40.58
Like, cool, we can get there. But little this is like a very similar idea to reflect and diminish.

1708
01:52:40.58 --> 01:52:51.58
Yeah, well, I love that question, how much gear is missing? Because on our list of calibrated questions, we hold people almost exclusively to what and how.

1709
01:52:51.58 --> 01:53:01.58
And so how feels good to the other side. And through touching on what Connemann would talk about, it triggers in-depth thinking.

1710
01:53:01.58 --> 01:53:19.58
So the how question to immediately even think about the answer, let alone answer it, you put them in a completely different frame of mind, which takes all, you know, all the steam out, takes all the gas out of the tank, takes all the wind out of the sails, whatever you want,

1711
01:53:19.58 --> 01:53:27.58
of their reptilian brain, and you've now got them in a deep thinking mode. How's a great question? How is a great question?

1712
01:53:27.58 --> 01:53:37.58
Talk me through the next section here, tactical empathy. How do you use that? What does it mean?

1713
01:53:37.58 --> 01:53:45.58
First of all, we put the word tactical in front of it to destigmatize the word.

1714
01:53:45.58 --> 01:54:00.58
Because in common usage, the word is thought of as sympathy or compassion, and it's not. In usage, it's been convoluted and distorted. I can empathize. You know, I've been there. I feel that way. I agree.

1715
01:54:00.58 --> 01:54:11.58
That was not the original origin of the word or how it was meant to be applied. That was why I started collaborating with Harvard in the first place, because Bob Mnookin wrote in his book,

1716
01:54:11.58 --> 01:54:19.58
Empathy's Not Even Liking the Other Side. It's not agreement. It's not liking. It's demonstrating that you understand.

1717
01:54:19.58 --> 01:54:32.58
Now, and people equate understanding to agreement. In my terrorism days in New York, we're trying to get Muslims to testify against other Muslims in open court.

1718
01:54:32.58 --> 01:54:49.58
And they were shocked by that by a whole bunch of reasons. If you want to be proud to be an American, you know, have an Arab Muslim who's in this country just trying to work really hard.

1719
01:54:49.58 --> 01:54:57.58
They said to us after the trial, you know, when you told us ahead of time, this was about the truth we thought you were kidding.

1720
01:54:57.58 --> 01:55:06.58
And having gone through the process, we realized that your system is about the truth.

1721
01:55:06.58 --> 01:55:16.58
And so how did we get how did we get those Muslims to come in and testify? Honestly, I would sit down with them and I'd say right off the bat,

1722
01:55:16.58 --> 01:55:30.58
you think for the last 200 years there's been a succession of American governments that have all been anti Islamic. And they go, yeah.

1723
01:55:30.58 --> 01:55:40.58
Now that's empathy. I never said it was true. I didn't say I agreed. I didn't say I disagree. I took no position whatsoever on that statement.

1724
01:55:40.58 --> 01:55:50.58
I say you think this and I'd nail it on the head and none of it is that hard when you really realize you know where the other sides come from you just scared to say it.

1725
01:55:50.58 --> 01:56:02.58
Like I'd say it to these guys and you just watch them be shocked and then dial in with me having said what was in the back of their mind. That's all it is.

1726
01:56:02.58 --> 01:56:13.58
And that's and that is a similar thing to labeling. You say here labeling is a way of validating someone's emotion by acknowledging it.

1727
01:56:13.58 --> 01:56:22.58
Give someone's emotion a name and you show that you identify with how that person feels it gets you close to someone without asking about external factors you know nothing about.

1728
01:56:22.58 --> 01:56:33.58
Think of labeling as a shortcut to intimacy, a time saving emotional hack. So this is similar to oh this is what you think about a certain subject, which now I'm reading back to you.

1729
01:56:33.58 --> 01:56:45.58
Hey you think that the past 200 years has been anti Islamic governments. This would be it seems like you're angry about the way the Islamic world has been treated.

1730
01:56:45.58 --> 01:56:48.58
Yeah, that'd be a great start.

1731
01:56:48.58 --> 01:56:57.58
A good start like some of this stuff is ridiculous to an especially talking about politicians like I'm surprised more politicians don't don't get this.

1732
01:56:57.58 --> 01:57:03.58
Mario Cuomo Andrew Cuomo's father Chris Cuomo's father governor of New York.

1733
01:57:03.58 --> 01:57:12.58
I saw him addressed a hostile crowd of African Americans that were waiting for Winnie Mandela. This is just before Nelson Mandela gets out.

1734
01:57:12.58 --> 01:57:18.58
Winnie Mandela is doing a world tour they're keeping the pressure on the South African government make sure they let him go.

1735
01:57:18.58 --> 01:57:24.58
She's in New York. Heavy duty African American crowd almost all African American.

1736
01:57:24.58 --> 01:57:33.58
Mario Cuomo isn't just not African American he's Italian which in New York is a much different dynamic.

1737
01:57:33.58 --> 01:57:44.58
At the time a couple of black guys have been chased out of an Italian neighborhood into traffic and it got killed by getting hit by cars. Tensions with the Italians are very high.

1738
01:57:44.58 --> 01:57:50.58
Cuomo steps up into a crowd that is just short of throwing rocks at him before he said a word.

1739
01:57:50.58 --> 01:57:57.58
He starts out and he starts going you see a world that doesn't take your skin color into account.

1740
01:57:57.58 --> 01:58:08.58
You see a world that doesn't give you a chance because of where you came from and how they perceive you and he just started laying out thing after thing after thing after thing that they were in fact feeling and thinking.

1741
01:58:08.58 --> 01:58:18.58
Not agreeing with any of it. I guarantee you before he stepped out on the stage he probably said to one of his aides and watch me turn this crowd around.

1742
01:58:18.58 --> 01:58:35.58
They start cheering him inside of about five minutes before he's finished with them they loved him like they were so in favor because he dialed into them and what they were thinking and feeling and he wasn't afraid to say it.

1743
01:58:35.58 --> 01:58:39.58
And to this day I'm shocked that more politicians don't do that.

1744
01:58:39.58 --> 01:58:45.58
This is not agreement. He takes no position on whatsoever. This is what you see.

1745
01:58:45.58 --> 01:58:56.58
Yeah. Yeah. It lets that person understand that you understand at a minimum. That's what we're looking for.

1746
01:58:56.58 --> 01:59:09.58
You say here is you try and insert tools of tactical empathy into your daily life. I encourage you to think of them as extensions of natural human interactions as not and not artificial conversational ticks in any interaction.

1747
01:59:09.58 --> 01:59:25.58
It pleases us to feel that the other side is listening and acknowledging our situation whether you are negotiating a business deal or simply chatting to a person at the supermarket butcher counter creating empathetic relationship and encouraging your counterpart to expand on their situation as a basis of healthy interaction.

1748
01:59:25.58 --> 01:59:35.58
Now this is something I say to people a lot. I say hey listen you can't pretend to do this stuff. You're not Robert De Niro and you're not Meryl Streep.

1749
01:59:35.58 --> 01:59:47.58
So don't pretend to be curious about them. Don't pretend. Just really feel that way. Yeah. You need to say hey I really want to learn what you know I really want to understand what you're thinking here because if you're trying to act you're going to fail.

1750
01:59:47.58 --> 01:59:59.58
Most people are going to fail when they're trying to act. And I always say intent has a smell. So if you come in there and you're just trying to butter me up with some little conversation I'm going to smell it.

1751
01:59:59.58 --> 02:00:08.58
Most people are going to smell that. I know when I the reason I know that is because when I was a young seal I was the youngest and most junior guy in my first two seal platoons.

1752
02:00:08.58 --> 02:00:20.58
So when you know the boss would come in we all we you know whatever bullshit he was throwing we'd see right through it like OK I see what's really going on here. Intense going to have a smell.

1753
02:00:20.58 --> 02:00:37.58
So it should be earnest all the stuff should be earnest. You go on to say some key points here. Imagine yourself in your counterpart situation. The beauty of empathy is that it doesn't demand that you agree with the other person's ideas.

1754
02:00:37.58 --> 02:00:48.58
You may well find them crazy. But by acknowledging the other person situations you immediately convey that you're listening. And once they know you are listening they may tell you something you can use.

1755
02:00:48.58 --> 02:01:06.58
So boom the reasons why a counterpart will not make an agreement with you are often more powerful than why they will make a deal. So focus first on clearing the barriers to agreement denying barriers or negative influences gives them credence.

1756
02:01:06.58 --> 02:01:10.58
Get them into the open. What do you mean by that.

1757
02:01:10.58 --> 02:01:21.58
Which part. You and I are talking and what barriers are you looking at. What barriers. Sometimes you're saying barriers. The reason I'm not going to agree to a deal.

1758
02:01:21.58 --> 02:01:34.58
Isn't because I can't find common ground. It's just that there's these barriers that I have that are that are worse. Right. Right. Right. So first of all kind of three different things there and I'm going to I'm going to try to drive the state through the heart of common ground to start with.

1759
02:01:34.58 --> 02:01:44.58
And this is my theory on common ground. First of all the strongest common ground is usually ethnicity or geography and geography is more powerful than ethnicity.

1760
02:01:44.58 --> 02:01:54.58
Like if you and I grew up in the same neighborhood. I don't know what all combination of ethnic ethnic groups you are. Because like if you were in New York you'd be one of five.

1761
02:01:54.58 --> 02:01:56.58
And I wouldn't know which one it is.

1762
02:01:56.58 --> 02:02:04.58
He's talking to Echo Charles right now by the way. Yeah. So but if we grew up in the same neighborhood like you and I resonate.

1763
02:02:04.58 --> 02:02:12.58
Now if you and I had the exact same ethnicity and you grew up in New York City and I grew up in Mississippi. We're like I don't know what this dude is talking about.

1764
02:02:12.58 --> 02:02:22.58
There's going to be some resonance but geography is stronger. Now then common ground also. Why do I want to have common ground with you. So you understand me.

1765
02:02:22.58 --> 02:02:36.58
So we say we share core values. You understand where I'm coming from. And so if I just demonstrate that I understand I'm going to be what I don't got to be from your neighborhood.

1766
02:02:36.58 --> 02:02:47.58
You because what common ground is does this guy or gal understand me. So that just show somebody you understand and common ground is unnecessary.

1767
02:02:47.58 --> 02:03:02.58
Not a barriers. Example one of my favorites Bob Iger's book The Ride of a Lifetime. He's sitting down to negotiate what ends up being the sale of Pixar to Disney.

1768
02:03:02.58 --> 02:03:11.58
At the time jobs hates Disney sees with hatred for Disney.

1769
02:03:11.58 --> 02:03:20.58
And when I went to school everybody writes up that purchases you know it was obvious it was a great move. It was great for both companies. Not how this thing goes down.

1770
02:03:20.58 --> 02:03:29.58
I could get support in charge of Disney. He reaches out to jobs because he knows there's been bad blood. I just been the number two guy at Disney for nine years.

1771
02:03:29.58 --> 02:03:42.58
Reaches out to jobs and some congratulatory thing and jobs immediately shoots back at him. How long were you Michaels number two because he's blaming Michael Eisner.

1772
02:03:42.58 --> 02:03:53.58
How long were you the number two guy. Well this was always going down. Not willing to accept any compliment. So I guess is let's talk about this job says come on down.

1773
02:03:53.58 --> 02:04:01.58
Yeah you want to talk to me. Come into my backyard. Go to the Apple campus. Think you're ready to set out jobs once you work off a whiteboard.

1774
02:04:01.58 --> 02:04:15.58
Pros and cons. Offers the pen to Iger says you go first. Now Iger knows how much bad blood there is here. He is not anxious to say a word.

1775
02:04:15.58 --> 02:04:25.58
And this is in his book. So he says not Steve go ahead. Steve gets up. Jobs starts writing all the reasons why not to do it.

1776
02:04:25.58 --> 02:04:35.58
All the barriers. He effectively does this approach on himself and writes some nasty stuff about Disney.

1777
02:04:35.58 --> 02:04:45.58
Like just short of out now profanity insulting your culture sucks. You guys suck. Everything about you is horrible. Your children you know.

1778
02:04:45.58 --> 02:04:57.58
I mean he everything he's laying all this stuff out there and he kind of gets done and he looks to hand the pen back to Iger who's who's not just crestfallen because he just

1779
02:04:57.58 --> 02:05:11.58
thinks feels like he's got the stuffing kicked out of him. And he says well I guess there are a lot of negatives there. And Jobs look back at him and says you know sometimes the positive outweighs the negative

1780
02:05:11.58 --> 02:05:25.58
because he deactivated all the barriers. They got all the barriers out. They got him out into the open air. They cleared their head by first discussing and just calling him out.

1781
02:05:25.58 --> 02:05:38.58
Like Bob Iger does not offer a bit of explanation for any of this. Iger never says but that wasn't true or but oh yeah you know nothing he doesn't say a word he just lets all the negatives get out there.

1782
02:05:38.58 --> 02:05:52.58
And when he when he lets jobs run the full course of the reasons for not doing it. Then jobs is left with the positives which is in fact the way humans make decisions.

1783
02:05:52.58 --> 02:06:02.58
You will reconcile in your head how do you live with the negatives deal with them deactivate them before you decide to do something.

1784
02:06:02.58 --> 02:06:18.58
If you can reconcile all those negatives as soon as you do your brain then goes to the positive. And then the positive picks up this tremendous amount of velocity having been unshackled from the negatives.

1785
02:06:18.58 --> 02:06:24.58
We do it all the time. We do it constantly.

1786
02:06:24.58 --> 02:06:36.58
I've had this thought a couple times already during this discussion. And it just hit me again. The idea of talking about the negatives.

1787
02:06:36.58 --> 02:06:51.58
You know right now in the veteran community there's a huge issue with PTSD and veteran suicide. And I've talked about this before when I've lost my friends in combat.

1788
02:06:51.58 --> 02:07:02.58
Every time I've been a guy that was like OK you're giving the eulogy you're giving them a moral speech so I had to go and sit down in the in the pain and sorrow.

1789
02:07:02.58 --> 02:07:18.58
And write down what I'm going to say to a crowd of people you know in a day or two days. And what you end up doing is you end up thinking through and putting on paper like this terrible situation.

1790
02:07:18.58 --> 02:07:31.58
And then you know coming out of the military when I got out of the military I was talking to people telling the leadership lessons that I've learned but in telling the leadership lessons that I've learned you're also talking through some of the really bad things that happened.

1791
02:07:31.58 --> 02:07:45.58
So as I hear you say that look you got to get those negatives out there. I tell veterans that a lot you know get helps when you talk through these things. You know they say that about World War two versus Vietnam World War two.

1792
02:07:45.58 --> 02:07:59.58
Wow. You got done with World War two. What did you do. You got on a ship with a bunch of other guys that just were in combat and you sailed back to America for six weeks and you sat below decks and told stories to each other about the friends that you lost and all the stuff that you've been through.

1793
02:07:59.58 --> 02:08:10.58
Well in Vietnam what did you do. You got done with your tour you got on a plane for 15 hours and then you got dropped off in Main Street America you didn't get to process it. You didn't get to talk about any of this stuff.

1794
02:08:10.58 --> 02:08:22.58
And so we got there. Yeah and then you got yelled at. So yeah this idea of getting the negatives out there even though it's uncomfortable and it is uncomfortable. It sucks. No one wants to do it.

1795
02:08:22.58 --> 02:08:33.58
But if you do it you start to deal with them. You start to contend with it. And then I can tell you right now the more you do it the more you process it the better you're going to feel.

1796
02:08:33.58 --> 02:08:40.58
So it's not even just a negotiation thing. This is like a life thing. Yeah.

1797
02:08:40.58 --> 02:08:58.58
Another note you make pause after you label a barrier or mirror or mirror a statement let it sink in don't worry the other party will fill the silence getting used to that silence thing label your counterparts fears to diffuse the power.

1798
02:08:58.58 --> 02:09:11.58
We all want to talk about happy stuff but remember the faster you interrupt action in your counterparts amygdala the part of the brain that generates fear the faster you can generate feelings of safety well being and trust same idea right.

1799
02:09:11.58 --> 02:09:20.58
If we talk about that thing that is pissing you off or that thing that's scaring you the minute you let out out of that cage it like loses some of its power right.

1800
02:09:20.58 --> 02:09:29.58
You know when we work with explosive we do something called tamping the explosives which means you compress that you hold that thing in and it's going to cause more damage.

1801
02:09:29.58 --> 02:09:44.58
So what you cover up an explosive it creates a bigger explosion. That's why you see like a kid puts a firecracker in a microwave oven and it causes them because the microwave oven is shut and there's massive over pressure and it blows the door.

1802
02:09:44.58 --> 02:09:56.58
You know the hundred and fifty yards because you compressed it. Well it's the same thing with this fear that you're talking about you let that thing out let it breathe.

1803
02:09:56.58 --> 02:10:06.58
It's going to take the sting off of it. That's why you know you just talked about this with Steve job list the worst things that the other party could say about you and say them before the other person can.

1804
02:10:06.58 --> 02:10:14.58
Counterintuitive counterintuitive what's counterintuitive about this is I think to myself you know if I actually tell Chris that it seems like I'm ripping him off.

1805
02:10:14.58 --> 02:10:29.58
What if he doesn't think that he probably won't know and why should I admit to it. He knows he knows he's thinking that you're thinking if I'm thinking that hey this price is probably high he's definitely thinking the price is high.

1806
02:10:29.58 --> 02:10:36.58
Remember you're dealing with a person who wants to be appreciated and understood so usually able to reinforce and encourage positive perception dynamics there you go.

1807
02:10:36.58 --> 02:10:41.58
I mean this is just awesome techniques here.

1808
02:10:41.58 --> 02:10:48.58
The opening to chapter four here is kind of a surprise beware of yes and master no.

1809
02:10:48.58 --> 02:11:00.58
At some point in their development all negotiators have to come to grips with no when you come to realize the real psychological dynamic behind it you'll love the word.

1810
02:11:00.58 --> 02:11:04.58
It's not just that you lose your fear of it but that you can come to learn what it does for you and how you can build deals out of it.

1811
02:11:04.58 --> 02:11:11.58
Yes and maybe you're often worthless but no always alters the conversation talk us through that.

1812
02:11:11.58 --> 02:11:19.58
Yeah I think I first came across this idea Jim Camp wrote a book in 2002 called start with no.

1813
02:11:19.58 --> 02:11:24.58
And I remember seeing that on a bookshelf like doing a double take on like what start with no.

1814
02:11:24.58 --> 02:11:28.58
I thought we were supposed to get the yes. Yes it was a magic word.

1815
02:11:28.58 --> 02:11:35.58
And he had discovered inadvertently that if you just tell people it was OK to say no.

1816
02:11:35.58 --> 02:11:42.58
They will agree. He's right up front he called the right to veto and he'd say you know I just want you know for before we get into this you can say no at any time.

1817
02:11:42.58 --> 02:11:48.58
Say no to me any time and I'll go away and he made more deals.

1818
02:11:48.58 --> 02:11:59.58
So accidentally one of my hostage negotiators in Pittsburgh tells me she says that you know because I'm making everybody read this book.

1819
02:11:59.58 --> 02:12:05.58
Did I do this. Now she was going to be removed removed from the negotiation team in Pittsburgh.

1820
02:12:05.58 --> 02:12:14.58
Pittsburgh because her boss was jealous of how much the police department loved her.

1821
02:12:14.58 --> 02:12:22.58
So she finds out she's going to get removed which is going to hurt the office's relationship with the police department.

1822
02:12:22.58 --> 02:12:26.58
But this guy doesn't care because he's jealous.

1823
02:12:26.58 --> 02:12:31.58
She sits down with him and she says do you want the FBI to be embarrassed.

1824
02:12:31.58 --> 02:12:39.58
Now I remember when she first told me that I remember thinking through at the moment like I would never have had the guts to say like that sounds so manipulative.

1825
02:12:39.58 --> 02:12:43.58
I imagine this guy just burst into flames on the spot.

1826
02:12:43.58 --> 02:12:53.58
But instead this guy relaxes he leans back in his chair you know he steeples with his hands like it's what people do when he feels really good about themselves.

1827
02:12:53.58 --> 02:12:57.58
And he goes no.

1828
02:12:57.58 --> 02:13:01.58
She says what do you want me to do.

1829
02:13:01.58 --> 02:13:09.58
And he says well you know stop letting this stuff interfere with your investigations now go back to work so he calls her into fire from the team.

1830
02:13:09.58 --> 02:13:11.58
She walks out no problem.

1831
02:13:11.58 --> 02:13:19.58
So I'm like there's something here and then I start thinking about other conversations I've had Lieutenant on a police department.

1832
02:13:19.58 --> 02:13:25.58
That I thought got got in this guy's way a lot because he was over managed him.

1833
02:13:25.58 --> 02:13:31.58
I remember him saying to me once you know a lieutenant's job is to say no.

1834
02:13:31.58 --> 02:13:34.58
And I thought.

1835
02:13:34.58 --> 02:13:36.58
No it's not.

1836
02:13:36.58 --> 02:13:38.58
You know Lieutenant's the leader.

1837
02:13:38.58 --> 02:13:41.58
The leader's job is to encourage people not to say no.

1838
02:13:41.58 --> 02:13:47.58
So why is he saying this it makes it feel good to say no it makes him feel safe it makes him feel protected.

1839
02:13:47.58 --> 02:13:55.58
And we start experimenting with instead of letting people say no what happens if you actually get him to say no.

1840
02:13:55.58 --> 02:13:59.58
Like how does that change feelings the way they react.

1841
02:13:59.58 --> 02:14:09.58
And it makes such a massive difference like instantaneous like if it's important I don't say do you disagree I say do you disagree.

1842
02:14:09.58 --> 02:14:12.58
I don't say is this a good idea is this a ridiculous idea.

1843
02:14:12.58 --> 02:14:17.58
I don't say you know what I'm never going for yes I'm always going for no.

1844
02:14:17.58 --> 02:14:21.58
And you know if I can't because I know I'm all over the place here.

1845
02:14:21.58 --> 02:14:31.58
I'm on a plane from JFK to LA where it's a red eye and black businessman sitting next to me.

1846
02:14:31.58 --> 02:14:33.58
He's kind of loud.

1847
02:14:33.58 --> 02:14:41.58
He's got a he's got a big colorful sweater on but I just you know not not not crazy out there but I just think you know interesting

1848
02:14:41.58 --> 02:14:44.58
interesting cat clearly a businessman.

1849
02:14:44.58 --> 02:14:53.58
He's got people on his team because people that are sitting you know back in the economy or walking by and you know a boss a doing and finally

1850
02:14:53.58 --> 02:14:59.58
but I hear him on a phone and he's just trying to force people to say yes.

1851
02:14:59.58 --> 02:15:06.58
And finally I can't take it anymore in between calls and I tap on a short I said look.

1852
02:15:06.58 --> 02:15:13.58
Get him to say no change your questions you drive me crazy I can't take it anymore I can I'm hearing you shove this down people's

1853
02:15:13.58 --> 02:15:15.58
throats switch from yes to no.

1854
02:15:15.58 --> 02:15:22.58
And I go and set and again instead of the greed the disagree instead of would you do this are you against doing this.

1855
02:15:22.58 --> 02:15:27.58
And I give him a quick rundown of how to make the switch and he's smart dude picks it right up really fast.

1856
02:15:27.58 --> 02:15:29.58
So he gets back on the phone.

1857
02:15:29.58 --> 02:15:34.58
And I also say you know the reason you should listen to me is because I wrote this book never split the difference.

1858
02:15:34.58 --> 02:15:41.58
So just do it smart dude learnable coach will does it instantaneous looks back to me says thanks.

1859
02:15:41.58 --> 02:15:50.58
He says let me introduce myself my name is Trevor you may know me by my stage name Buster rhymes.

1860
02:15:50.58 --> 02:15:51.58
Wow.

1861
02:15:51.58 --> 02:15:52.58
Okay.

1862
02:15:52.58 --> 02:16:01.58
You know your hair is a little shorter right now didn't recognize you right off the bat but I do recognize that name.

1863
02:16:01.58 --> 02:16:04.58
You go on to say no has a lot of skills.

1864
02:16:04.58 --> 02:16:12.58
No allows real issues to be brought forth no protects people from making and lets them correct ineffective decisions.

1865
02:16:12.58 --> 02:16:19.58
No slows things down so people can freely embrace their decisions and their agreements they enter into.

1866
02:16:19.58 --> 02:16:25.58
No helps people feel safe secure emotionally comfortable and in control of all their decisions.

1867
02:16:25.58 --> 02:16:33.58
No moves everyone everyone's efforts forward.

1868
02:16:33.58 --> 02:16:51.58
And there's a there's a thing that you point out here which is important because you say using this chapters tools and daily life is difficult for many people because they go directly against one of society's biggest social dictums that is be nice.

1869
02:16:51.58 --> 02:17:13.58
Right especially because in the book you're like hey smile be pleasant and and you know getting people to say no is one of those things you say we've instrumentalized nicest in a way as a way of greasing the social wheels yet it's often a roost we're polite and we don't disagree to get through daily existence with the least degree of friction but by turning nice

1870
02:17:13.58 --> 02:17:29.58
into a lubricant we've leached it of meaning a smile and a nod might signify get me out of here as much as it means nice to meet you that's death for a good negotiator who gains their power by understanding their counterpart situation and extracting information about their

1871
02:17:29.58 --> 02:17:37.58
counterparts desires and needs extracting that information means getting the other party to feel safe and in control.

1872
02:17:37.58 --> 02:17:53.58
And while it may sound contradictory the way to get there is by letting the other party by getting the other party to disagree to draw their own boundaries to define their desires as a function of what they do not want.

1873
02:17:53.58 --> 02:17:57.58
In other words getting them to say no.

1874
02:17:57.58 --> 02:18:07.58
Yeah it's nuts it's just it's of the of the you know the different skills are counterintuitive to the end to their own degree.

1875
02:18:07.58 --> 02:18:19.58
Like the extremely strong degree that getting somebody say yes makes a comfortable concern worried about what kind of traps are walking into where's a hook what have I forgotten.

1876
02:18:19.58 --> 02:18:29.58
Complete different 180 degree turn on getting them to say no like that the comfort level from saying no.

1877
02:18:29.58 --> 02:18:37.58
And then the ability to think things through immediately like if I were to say to you disagree do you disagree.

1878
02:18:37.58 --> 02:18:47.58
You go no I don't disagree but here the following problems and you'd lay them right out one two three four five right off the top of your head have no problem if I just said do you agree.

1879
02:18:47.58 --> 02:18:53.58
And you do want to say yes I agree but here the following problems you won't do it the second way.

1880
02:18:53.58 --> 02:19:00.58
Because you would have felt that the mere utterance of the word yes hooked you.

1881
02:19:00.58 --> 02:19:07.58
And so then anything that you lay out after that feels like you're digging yourself in deeper.

1882
02:19:07.58 --> 02:19:12.58
But having said no you don't feel hooked.

1883
02:19:12.58 --> 02:19:17.58
So now you're going to lay out the next four or five things that you might need.

1884
02:19:17.58 --> 02:19:21.58
Because you don't feel like you're digging yourself in deeper.

1885
02:19:21.58 --> 02:19:33.58
And the next four or five things after the yes or no are what's critical it's never never right there it's never at the point of decision it's really here are the problems.

1886
02:19:33.58 --> 02:19:42.58
Or here's what you got to accomplish and you got to get past that and you get past it freely when people say no.

1887
02:19:42.58 --> 02:19:51.58
Because they feel safe and protected they feel no sense of obligation they don't feel like they're digging themselves in with each thing they say after that.

1888
02:19:51.58 --> 02:19:58.58
I got that emotion from that you got an example in the book real common example.

1889
02:19:58.58 --> 02:20:07.58
The two the two examples you is now a bad is now a bad time to talk versus do you have a few minutes to talk.

1890
02:20:07.58 --> 02:20:10.58
Like when someone calls you up on the phone and says hey do you have a few minutes to talk right now.

1891
02:20:10.58 --> 02:20:15.58
I want to say no but I also kind of feel like when I say yes like what do we get.

1892
02:20:15.58 --> 02:20:18.58
But when someone says is it a bad time to talk right now I'm like no it's not a bad time.

1893
02:20:18.58 --> 02:20:20.58
I'm like OK with it.

1894
02:20:20.58 --> 02:20:23.58
Just one of those things.

1895
02:20:23.58 --> 02:20:33.58
The other thing that you got in here that really aligns a lot with what I talk about a lot is negotiate in their world persuasion is not about how bright or smooth you or forcefully you are.

1896
02:20:33.58 --> 02:20:39.58
It's about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea.

1897
02:20:39.58 --> 02:20:45.58
So don't beat them with logic or brute force ask them questions that open past your goals it's not about you.

1898
02:20:45.58 --> 02:20:51.58
I say all the time written in these books make it their idea right how can I make this their idea.

1899
02:20:51.58 --> 02:20:57.58
And the other thing I say a lot is the truth doesn't matter if I punch you in the face with it right.

1900
02:20:57.58 --> 02:21:00.58
If I punch you in the face with the truth you're not going to be open to it.

1901
02:21:00.58 --> 02:21:08.58
You're going to be pissed and you're going to find a way to defend yourself and you're probably going to stab me in the neck with your facts from your perspective.

1902
02:21:08.58 --> 02:21:13.58
So with a dull spoon right stabbing an egg with a little spoon.

1903
02:21:13.58 --> 02:21:25.58
Yeah. Now we get into this section here trigger the two or the chapter five trigger the two words that immediately transform any negotiation.

1904
02:21:25.58 --> 02:21:41.58
You say the crisis negotiation unit the FBI crisis negotiation negotiation unit developed what is a powerful staple in the high stakes world of crisis negotiation the behavioral change stairway model BCSM behavioral

1905
02:21:41.58 --> 02:21:55.58
change stairway model the model proposes five stages active listening empathy rapport influence and behavioral change that take any negotiator from listening to influencing behavior.

1906
02:21:55.58 --> 02:22:09.58
The origins of this model can be traced back to the great American psychologist Carl Rogers who proposed that real change can only come when a therapist accepts that the client as he or she is an approach known as unconditional positive regard

1907
02:22:09.58 --> 02:22:19.58
the vast majority of us however as Rogers explained come to expect that love praise and approval are dependent on saying and doing things people consider correct.

1908
02:22:19.58 --> 02:22:33.58
That is because for most of us positive regard for the positive regard we we experience is conditional we develop a habit of hiding who we really are and what we really think instead calibrating our words to gain approval but disclosing little.

1909
02:22:33.58 --> 02:22:45.58
So they come up with this thing active listening that's a first step empathy alright I kind of see where you're coming from rapport now we're starting to understand each other influence you're starting to listen to what I have to say and then behavioral change

1910
02:22:45.58 --> 02:22:48.58
you're actually going to do something different based on the influence here.

1911
02:22:48.58 --> 02:23:08.58
If you successfully take someone up the behavioral change stairway each stage attempting to engender more trust and more connection there will be a breakthrough moment when unconditional positive regard is established and you can begin exerting influence after years of refining the staircase

1912
02:23:08.58 --> 02:23:26.58
and its tactics I can teach anyone how to get to that moment but as legions of B school grads weaned on the most famous negotiating book in the world getting to us have ultimately discovered you more than likely think more than likely haven't gotten there yet if what you're hearing is the word yes you'll soon learn the

1913
02:23:26.58 --> 02:23:45.58
greatest two words in any negotiation are actually that's right that's what you're looking for you're looking for the other person the person that you're negotiating with to say that's right the that's right big breakthrough usually doesn't come at the beginning of a negotiation it's

1914
02:23:45.58 --> 02:24:10.58
a subtle epiphany so talk to us about that's right well it's what people say when they're completely all in on what was just said like and if you look for you see it everywhere and and one of the great examples that I like to use is people that are devoted to

1915
02:24:10.58 --> 02:24:29.58
and my some point of this I mean if that isn't the proof of that's right moment somewhere in a speech or in the presidential debate when he articulated something when you bought in completely you looked at the screen and you pointed at it and you said that's right

1916
02:24:29.58 --> 02:24:48.58
and it's not just trump it's any charismatic leader anywhere when the charismatic leader is articulated something that you believe is totally true and it totally gets you nobody ever says you're right they always say that's right

1917
02:24:48.58 --> 02:25:07.58
and there's that statement is when when you were totally bought in on what was just said and as is and our co-author tall was one that pulled out the description of it being a subtle epiphany tall contributed brilliantly to the book I mean he brought a lot to the table besides just being a writer

1918
02:25:07.58 --> 02:25:26.58
and so then as I was getting more into neuroscience I look up neuroscience the neuroscience of epiphany what neurochemicals do you get hit with you get hit with serotonin and oxytocin and oxytocin is the bonding drug

1919
02:25:26.58 --> 02:25:45.58
so they hence people bonded to Donald Trump or any other leader you're you're bonded to Obama you're bonded to whoever has ordered the things that you believe to be completely true there's this it's a one way bond and there's a feeling of a bond

1920
02:25:45.58 --> 02:26:05.58
and then again back to you were men's podcast you know for me just being bonded is enough and another one of his podcast he points out oxytocin and clients people to tell the truth so now not only you bonded to me you're more likely to tell me the truth

1921
02:26:05.58 --> 02:26:24.58
and then he points out on yet another podcast serotonin the feeling of satisfaction which means you're not as demanding so if I can get it that's right out of you you're going to bond to me you're going to tell me the truth and you're going to make fewer demands what else do I want

1922
02:26:24.58 --> 02:26:42.58
yeah the the example and again the details in the book are are outstanding but the example that you give goes back to the thing that I opened up with you had subaya this mastermind terrorist and you were in negotiations with them and you're actually working through a translator

1923
02:26:42.58 --> 02:26:58.58
and the translator was hard ass you know pretty much let's we need to go at him type of attitude and you kind of convinced him over time to take a less a more indirect approach and and eventually the nego the negotiator kind of read back

1924
02:26:58.58 --> 02:27:16.58
they look you've been oppressed for this long the Spanish came here they converted your people against their will and you've been suffering underneath this government and subaya says that's right and that's what changes it that's what changes his attitude yeah yeah

1925
02:27:16.58 --> 02:27:36.58
and if I can couple of tangents because yeah you know we that was also when I was working with McCraven okay not Admiral but captain McCraven and he was he was phenomenal and he chaired he created the hostage working group the National Security Council his leaders you know what a great

1926
02:27:36.58 --> 02:27:52.58
guy to work with I can remember particular when we're working that case in the one that followed on like there was some stuff that the US government was very nervous about and you needed a guy who stood up properly for everybody and for the right thing if you will

1927
02:27:52.58 --> 02:28:12.58
and I can remember being at one meeting in particular captain McCraven McCraven I don't mean to be disrespectful I'm sure it sounds disrespectful just call McCraven but McCraven stands up and he says you know what I'm not going to stop talking about this to somebody tells me to sit down and shut up and they're going to have to tell me twice

1928
02:28:12.58 --> 02:28:34.58
and I remember thinking that's the guy I want talking to the White House that's the guy that I want talking to the Department of State and we're in the midst of that shilling case and the last thing that we need when we're in a forward operating base is any sort of

1929
02:28:34.58 --> 02:28:52.58
insecurity in decision from Washington DC and when you're out there on the front lines having a guy like Captain Bill McCraven Admiral Bill McCraven holding things together back in Washington DC just ridiculously reassuring feeling that he was a great guy

1930
02:28:52.58 --> 02:29:10.58
I don't know about it that's awesome there's a big difference and you pointed out in the book there's a huge difference and you mentioned it but I just want to cover it again just to make sure people catch this there's a huge difference between that's right and your right

1931
02:29:10.58 --> 02:29:28.58
because you're right and here's a good way to translate this you're talking to your wife and you say something she goes oh you're right that is not what we're looking for that means she wants you to shut up and she's going to carry on and you haven't come to any kind of conclusions

1932
02:29:28.58 --> 02:29:41.58
so there's a big difference getting someone to say you're right in fact there's a lot of times where that's in increase in hostilities that just means they're looking for another way to attack you

1933
02:29:41.58 --> 02:29:51.58
yeah and they haven't quite got it yet but they're they're waiting they're laying in wait and it is if they're giving you your right you got problems

1934
02:29:51.58 --> 02:29:58.58
be careful with that one look for that's right

1935
02:29:58.58 --> 02:30:12.58
next section bend their realities and and you get into this here don't compromise which is interesting thing we're going to talk through

1936
02:30:12.58 --> 02:30:26.58
the win-win mindset pushed by so many negotiation experts is usually ineffective and often disastrous at best it satisfies neither side and if you employ it with the counterpart who has a win-lose approach you're setting yourself up to be swindled

1937
02:30:26.58 --> 02:30:37.58
of course as we've noted previously you need to keep a cooperative rapport building a pathetic approach the kind that creates a dynamic in which deals can be made but you have to get rid of that naivete

1938
02:30:37.58 --> 02:30:50.58
because compromise splitting the difference can lead to terrible outcomes compromise is often a bad deal and a key theme will hit in this chapter is no deal is better than a bad deal

1939
02:30:50.58 --> 02:30:56.58
even in kidnapping yes a bad deal in kidnapping is where someone pays and no one comes out

1940
02:30:56.58 --> 02:31:05.58
to make my point on compromise let me paint an example a woman wants her husband to wear black shoes with a suit but her husband doesn't want her he prefers brown shoes so what do they do they compromise

1941
02:31:05.58 --> 02:31:22.58
they split the difference they meet half ways halfway and you guess he wears one black shoe and one brown shoe is this the best outcome in fact no in fact it's the worst possible outcome either of the two outcomes black or brown would have been better

1942
02:31:22.58 --> 02:31:38.58
I'm here to call bullshit on compromise right now we don't compromise because it's right we compromise because it's easy and because it saves face we compromise in order to say that at least we got half the pie distilled to his essence we compromise to be safe

1943
02:31:38.58 --> 02:31:56.58
most people in negotiation are driven by fear or by the desire to avoid pain to free you are driven by their actual goals so don't settle here's a simple rule never split the difference creative solutions are almost always preceded by some degree of risk annoyance confusion and conflict

1944
02:31:56.58 --> 02:32:07.58
accommodation and compromise produced none of that you've got to embrace the hard stuff that's where the great deals are and that's what negotiators do

1945
02:32:07.58 --> 02:32:09.58
amen

1946
02:32:09.58 --> 02:32:13.58
at the class amen

1947
02:32:13.58 --> 02:32:16.58
what point did you realize that was the title of the book

1948
02:32:16.58 --> 02:32:37.58
tall came up with that the original title was killer deals we started working with tall Brandon and I my son Brandon uncredited co author of the book and tosses right so we're gonna we'll start with killer deals and at some point in time the proper title of the book will occur to me and I'll tell you what it is now you're free to disagree

1949
02:32:37.58 --> 02:33:04.58
but I tell you when I get deeply into this enough it I'll give you the title and probably about halfway through the whole writing process was when he said titles never split the difference says that the essence of what you guys are talking about it if you completely understand it and understand why he says that's what the title is

1950
02:33:04.58 --> 02:33:11.58
and we're like you got it that's right

1951
02:33:11.58 --> 02:33:29.58
yeah he came he tall came over that probably about halfway through the writing process now how does that we're gonna get into I think I'm gonna cover it but the the acrimony approach right now in the acrimony approach you're shooting for a specific number

1952
02:33:29.58 --> 02:33:43.58
right and you know you're kind of compromising to get to that number no why well if you shoot for specific number was that a compromise as long as you get your number but that that's my number

1953
02:33:43.58 --> 02:34:05.58
meaning you want to you want to tell me this car for $10,000 I only want to give you $7000 my first offer is a low ball offer right and then I come up on my first offer 65% of what I want to pay then I go 8595 then 100% of what I want to pay right so I guess we didn't we didn't split the difference

1954
02:34:05.58 --> 02:34:24.58
no it's not and there's also a very specific sort of rationale behind the offers each offer has to be effectively half as much as the previous increase you got you got always have diminishing increases the other side is going to feel like they're beating into a position they can just be very gratifying for them

1955
02:34:24.58 --> 02:34:43.58
deadlines you talk about here time is one of the most critical crucial variables in any negotiation a simple passing of time and it's sharp because cousin the deadline are the screw that pressures every deal to conclusion

1956
02:34:43.58 --> 02:35:02.58
where your deadline is real and absolute or merely a line in the sand it can trick you into believing that doing a deal now is more important than getting a good deal deadlines regularly make people say and do impulsive things that are against their best interests because we all have a natural tendency to rush as a deadline approaches

1957
02:35:02.58 --> 02:35:24.58
yeah not only rushes a deadline approaches but not rush at all until it's looming like in people lose track of that it's the process and deadlines are really just designed to kick the process in the gear but human beings being what they are if you give somebody a deadline of Friday

1958
02:35:24.58 --> 02:35:42.58
don't expect to get into any kind of conversation before Thursday should not get out yeah I've done a lot of deals like on the way to the airport or on our way out and that's when the discussion actually starts right not optimal right

1959
02:35:42.58 --> 02:36:05.58
I'm skipping ahead a little bit in the book the f word why it's so powerful when to use it and how the most powerful word in negotiations is fair as human beings were might least swayed by how much we feel we have been respected people comply with agreements if they feel they've been treated fairly

1960
02:36:05.58 --> 02:36:32.58
and lash out if they don't once you understand what a messy emotional and destructive dynamic fairness can be you can see why fair is a tremendously powerful word and you need to use it with care in in fact of the three ways that people drop the f bomb only one is positive the most common is a judo like defensive move that destabilizes the other side this manipulation usually takes the form something like we just want was fair

1961
02:36:32.58 --> 02:36:48.58
think back to the last time someone made this implicit accusation of unfairness to you and I bet you have to admit that it immediately triggered feelings of defensiveness and discomfort these feelings are often subconscious and lead to irrational concession

1962
02:36:48.58 --> 02:37:06.58
the second use of the f bomb is more nefarious in this one your counterpart will basically accuse you of being dense or dishonest by saying we've given you a fair offer the terrible little jab meant to distract your attention away from distract your attention manipulating to giving in

1963
02:37:06.58 --> 02:37:29.58
if you find yourself in this situation the best reaction is to simply mirror the f that has just been a lot that you fair you respond positive let the words power do to them what it was intended to do to you following that with a label seems like you're ready to provide evidence that supports that which eludes to the opening of their books or otherwise handing over information that will either contradict their claim to fairness or give you more data to work with

1964
02:37:29.58 --> 02:37:53.58
then you had previously right away you declaw the attack the last use of the f word is my favorite because it's positive and constructive it sets the stage for honest and empathetic negotiation here's how I use it early on in a negotiation I say I want you to feel like you're being treated fairly at all times so please stop me at any time if I'm being unfair and will address it

1965
02:37:53.58 --> 02:38:14.58
it's simple and clear and sets me up as an honest dealer with that statement I let people know it's okay to use the word with me if they use it honestly as a negotiator you should strive for reputation of being fair you represent reputation precede you let it precede you in a way that paves success

1966
02:38:14.58 --> 02:38:26.58
when I read all that I was like oh we all it seems like human beings have this sort of natural we're just raised that fairness is a big thing for us

1967
02:38:26.58 --> 02:38:50.58
and you know what I sometimes when I think of what I can't quite make a connection I think of the opposite and what that triggers in people so what's like the epic insult that guy's a cheater right that guy's a cheater oh yeah you want but he cheated you know you hate that guy you don't want to be that guy when someone says you cheated you get all defensive

1968
02:38:50.58 --> 02:39:02.58
so it's the same thing here this this f bomb when it gets dropped on you so I'm just hey we just want what's fair we need I'm not being fair and it could trigger you to make an ideal you shouldn't have made

1969
02:39:02.58 --> 02:39:29.58
a lot and the amount of time like it's rare that in a negotiation that has any sort of contentiousness to it at all the word will always come up I mean it's a great manipulative device and people often say it out of defensiveness but for the same for the same ends you know get the other side to change your mind

1970
02:39:29.58 --> 02:39:48.58
providing no evidence whatsoever as to why they should that's not fair yeah exactly yeah yeah that's you see it and usually it's it's when the tables and gotten turned on somebody in an unexpected way that's when they'll drop the word

1971
02:39:48.58 --> 02:40:09.58
what does that look like a person I know who's an eminently fair person was in a real estate negotiation right after the housing market where they were at drops substantially and they got the buyer to increase the offer above market

1972
02:40:09.58 --> 02:40:34.58
by simply saying we just want what's fair now the person that uses phrase had gotten the table tables turned on them by dropping a market so it wasn't even the buyer's fault I didn't do anything buyers following the market so this person out of simple defensiveness having had the tables turned on them

1973
02:40:34.58 --> 02:40:51.58
they felt that it was an unfair series of circumstances now is that the buyers fault buyers are spying in a real estate market that is dictated by the dynamics of the market and that was the first time it really jumped out at me

1974
02:40:51.58 --> 02:41:07.58
and then I started looking for it across the board because the person had told the story got the buyer to raise the price and I remember thinking like that wait wait wait as an innocent bystander here that you know that's not fair there's no fairness there

1975
02:41:07.58 --> 02:41:34.58
and I thought if a good person can do this and change completely change the dynamics in a relationship in the negotiation how often does it come up and then you start looking for it and you see it over and it is so effective that the manipulators have seen the good people use it and change the dynamics that they've gotten really good at using it to cover up manipulative behavior

1976
02:41:34.58 --> 02:41:38.58
watch out for that one

1977
02:41:38.58 --> 02:41:47.58
got a section in here bend their reality you start going to some of the methodologies of that anchor their emotions to bend your counterparts reality you have to start with the basics of empathy

1978
02:41:47.58 --> 02:42:06.58
so start out with an accusation with an accusation audit acknowledging all of their fears by anchoring their emotions in preparation for a loss you inflame the other side's loss aversion so that they'll jump at the chance to avoid it you talk about loss aversion people are people don't want to lose

1979
02:42:06.58 --> 02:42:07.58
right

1980
02:42:07.58 --> 02:42:13.58
and and this accusation audit is sort of what Steve Jobs put up on the board when he did it himself

1981
02:42:13.58 --> 02:42:14.58
right right

1982
02:42:14.58 --> 02:42:25.58
I could have done it if he if he had stepped up to the thing and said well you probably going to say this and this and this but he got Steve Jobs do which is even better

1983
02:42:25.58 --> 02:42:28.58
but you anchor those emotions

1984
02:42:28.58 --> 02:42:35.58
the other thing you say is let the other guy go first most of the time

1985
02:42:35.58 --> 02:42:50.58
I suggest you let the other side anchor monetary negotiations the real issues that neither side is a perfect information going on the table this means if you don't know enough to open up with confidence so this is what we hear all the time in negotiations you know you don't say the number first how much do you how much

1986
02:42:50.58 --> 02:42:56.58
will you give me for the car well what do you think it's worth like we do this around and around yeah

1987
02:42:56.58 --> 02:42:59.58
what are the disadvantages advantages of opening

1988
02:42:59.58 --> 02:43:01.58
or giving the number

1989
02:43:01.58 --> 02:43:11.58
well as very much as a general rule I'm I'm gonna want the other side so the number first because it's information it's gonna it's gonna tell me

1990
02:43:11.58 --> 02:43:18.58
it's gonna tell me data it's gonna tell me mindset where you're coming from it's gonna tell me a lot none of which am I getting

1991
02:43:18.58 --> 02:43:20.58
if I go first

1992
02:43:20.58 --> 02:43:23.58
so it's a general rule we don't go first

1993
02:43:23.58 --> 02:43:33.58
again a general rule it's at some point in time to keep from going around and around around I'm gonna throw a number out and I'm gonna characterize it before I throw it out

1994
02:43:33.58 --> 02:43:39.58
and if I'm gonna say this is a lot

1995
02:43:39.58 --> 02:43:50.58
when when we quote prices for our coaching first of all our coaching is more expensive if you can find negotiation coaching anywhere which is very hard to find

1996
02:43:50.58 --> 02:43:54.58
we're gonna charge you more than anybody else this

1997
02:43:54.58 --> 02:43:56.58
so I'm gonna say I'm gonna say that

1998
02:43:56.58 --> 02:44:02.58
I'm gonna charge you more than anybody else this somebody somebody wants to bring me in for a talk

1999
02:44:02.58 --> 02:44:11.58
I'm gonna I'm I'm gonna be so expensive and we're gonna quote you a heart stopping price

2000
02:44:11.58 --> 02:44:16.58
and then you get that causes you to reflect on your value

2001
02:44:16.58 --> 02:44:23.58
it causes you to run the numbers one of two things you're gonna you're gonna ask me what the number is

2002
02:44:23.58 --> 02:44:30.58
and you're gonna say I well you said it was expensive

2003
02:44:30.58 --> 02:44:35.58
or you're gonna say wow it's not as bad as I thought it was gonna be

2004
02:44:35.58 --> 02:44:38.58
and then we don't bargain

2005
02:44:38.58 --> 02:44:45.58
so if I got a thrown number I like to refer to as I never throw the number I'd naked

2006
02:44:45.58 --> 02:44:51.58
if I and if otherwise I want to know where you're coming from I also want to give you a price that you want

2007
02:44:51.58 --> 02:44:54.58
because price is a term

2008
02:44:54.58 --> 02:44:58.58
and I need to hit the sweet spot on your price

2009
02:44:58.58 --> 02:45:01.58
if I go too high

2010
02:45:01.58 --> 02:45:08.58
you're not gonna over deliver you're gonna feel like you undervalued yourself and you're gonna do the same amount of work if I pay you too much

2011
02:45:08.58 --> 02:45:10.58
I found that out the hard way

2012
02:45:10.58 --> 02:45:12.58
if I go too low

2013
02:45:12.58 --> 02:45:14.58
you're gonna do a lousy job

2014
02:45:14.58 --> 02:45:18.58
so what I need what I really want besides just throwing a number first

2015
02:45:18.58 --> 02:45:23.58
I want to know what number do you think a good number is

2016
02:45:23.58 --> 02:45:26.58
that you're gonna work really hard for

2017
02:45:26.58 --> 02:45:29.58
and feel like you earned your money

2018
02:45:29.58 --> 02:45:36.58
and not change that you just undervalued yourself in the past and now now all of a sudden I'm worth this much more money

2019
02:45:36.58 --> 02:45:39.58
which means you're not gonna put in extra effort

2020
02:45:39.58 --> 02:45:44.58
you're also talking here about if people are stuck on the money

2021
02:45:44.58 --> 02:45:46.58
you can start talking about other things

2022
02:45:46.58 --> 02:45:48.58
the non-monetary terms

2023
02:45:48.58 --> 02:45:51.58
so like if you're negotiating for a job

2024
02:45:51.58 --> 02:45:54.58
you start talking about things that don't have anything to do with money

2025
02:45:54.58 --> 02:45:58.58
and that can be a good way to start to move the conversation forward

2026
02:45:58.58 --> 02:46:01.58
the

2027
02:46:01.58 --> 02:46:04.58
this is just interesting psychology

2028
02:46:04.58 --> 02:46:06.58
the biggest thing to remember

2029
02:46:06.58 --> 02:46:08.58
when you start when you do get to numbers

2030
02:46:08.58 --> 02:46:11.58
you say the biggest thing to remember is that numbers that end in zero

2031
02:46:11.58 --> 02:46:13.58
inevitably feel like temporary placeholders

2032
02:46:13.58 --> 02:46:17.58
guesstimates that you can easily be negotiated off of

2033
02:46:17.58 --> 02:46:21.58
but anything you throw out that sounds less rounded

2034
02:46:21.58 --> 02:46:24.58
say $37,263

2035
02:46:24.58 --> 02:46:29.58
feels like a figure that you came to as a result of thoughtful calculation

2036
02:46:29.58 --> 02:46:33.58
such numbers feel serious and permanent to your counterpart

2037
02:46:33.58 --> 02:46:36.58
so use them to fortify your offers

2038
02:46:36.58 --> 02:46:38.58
yeah it's nuts right

2039
02:46:38.58 --> 02:46:40.58
I mean it's just that's voodoo

2040
02:46:40.58 --> 02:46:43.58
it is so true and it's just complete voodoo

2041
02:46:43.58 --> 02:46:47.58
and yet go look at the prices in a store

2042
02:46:47.58 --> 02:46:50.58
we see examples of it everywhere

2043
02:46:50.58 --> 02:46:53.58
they're all $9.95 or whatever

2044
02:46:53.58 --> 02:46:56.58
and there's a psychological thing to be like $10 seems like a ton of money

2045
02:46:56.58 --> 02:46:59.58
$9.95 I can afford all day

2046
02:46:59.58 --> 02:47:01.58
right

2047
02:47:01.58 --> 02:47:05.58
the original magic one that I love like iTunes

2048
02:47:05.58 --> 02:47:08.58
$0.99 for a song

2049
02:47:08.58 --> 02:47:12.58
back when the app store and you could get all your music for free

2050
02:47:12.58 --> 02:47:16.58
like Jobs and Apple like let's put a number on this

2051
02:47:16.58 --> 02:47:20.58
that seems so small and it's not a round number

2052
02:47:20.58 --> 02:47:24.58
and suddenly people were paying for music again

2053
02:47:24.58 --> 02:47:27.58
$0.99

2054
02:47:27.58 --> 02:47:30.58
still $0.99 for a song isn't it

2055
02:47:30.58 --> 02:47:32.58
some songs yeah

2056
02:47:32.58 --> 02:47:35.58
I guess it's all like streaming and all this stuff now

2057
02:47:35.58 --> 02:47:37.58
you don't really buy well actually I don't

2058
02:47:37.58 --> 02:47:39.58
I buy like the whole thing whatever that is

2059
02:47:39.58 --> 02:47:41.58
$1.29 sometimes

2060
02:47:41.58 --> 02:47:43.58
so they jack the prices

2061
02:47:43.58 --> 02:47:46.58
some key points

2062
02:47:46.58 --> 02:47:50.58
all negotiations are defined by a network of subterranean desires and needs

2063
02:47:50.58 --> 02:47:52.58
don't let yourself be fooled by the surface

2064
02:47:52.58 --> 02:47:56.58
once you know that the Haitian kidnappers want party money

2065
02:47:56.58 --> 02:47:59.58
you'll be better, you'll be miles better for beer

2066
02:47:59.58 --> 02:48:01.58
and there's a whole section in here about that

2067
02:48:01.58 --> 02:48:03.58
about these Haitian kidnappers

2068
02:48:03.58 --> 02:48:08.58
you worked all kinds like dozens of cases of these Haitian kidnappers

2069
02:48:08.58 --> 02:48:10.58
one of the things you've identified is they would like

2070
02:48:10.58 --> 02:48:12.58
kidnap early in the week

2071
02:48:12.58 --> 02:48:16.58
they wanted that money by Friday so they could go out and party

2072
02:48:16.58 --> 02:48:20.58
and so how much they need to have a great party that weekend

2073
02:48:20.58 --> 02:48:22.58
that's sort of the number that you would end up looking for

2074
02:48:22.58 --> 02:48:24.58
I mean it's awesome

2075
02:48:24.58 --> 02:48:26.58
splitting the differences wearing one black and one brown shoe

2076
02:48:26.58 --> 02:48:29.58
don't compromise meeting halfway often leads to bad deals for both sides

2077
02:48:29.58 --> 02:48:31.58
approaching deadlines

2078
02:48:31.58 --> 02:48:34.58
entice people to rush the negotiating process

2079
02:48:34.58 --> 02:48:37.58
do impulsive things that are against their best interests

2080
02:48:37.58 --> 02:48:39.58
we talked about the F word

2081
02:48:39.58 --> 02:48:45.58
you can bend your counterparts' reality by anchoring his starting point

2082
02:48:45.58 --> 02:48:49.58
before you make an offer emotionally anchor them by saying how bad it will be

2083
02:48:49.58 --> 02:48:55.58
when you get to numbers set an extreme anchor to make your real offer seem reasonable

2084
02:48:55.58 --> 02:48:57.58
or use a range to seem less aggressive

2085
02:48:57.58 --> 02:49:03.58
the real value of anything depends on what vantage point you're looking at it from

2086
02:49:03.58 --> 02:49:09.58
and last people tend people take more risks to avoid a loss than realize a gain

2087
02:49:09.58 --> 02:49:13.58
make sure your counterpart sees that there's something to lose by inaction

2088
02:49:13.58 --> 02:49:18.58
that's why the website says today only

2089
02:49:18.58 --> 02:49:21.58
you'll miss out

2090
02:49:21.58 --> 02:49:28.58
you got a section in here that's about fast forward a little bit calibrated

2091
02:49:28.58 --> 02:49:30.58
question calibrate your questions

2092
02:49:30.58 --> 02:49:35.58
and we kind of discussed this earlier if we were a cordon or not

2093
02:49:35.58 --> 02:49:38.58
but I talked about asking earnest questions as a leader you're asking earnest questions

2094
02:49:38.58 --> 02:49:44.58
and you've got this little bit similar approach but different verbiage here

2095
02:49:44.58 --> 02:49:47.58
calibrated questions are not just random requests for comment

2096
02:49:47.58 --> 02:49:49.58
they have a direction

2097
02:49:49.58 --> 02:49:52.58
once you figure out where you want a conversation to go you have to design the question

2098
02:49:52.58 --> 02:49:57.58
that will ease the conversation in that direction while letting the other guy think

2099
02:49:57.58 --> 02:50:00.58
it's his choice to take you there

2100
02:50:00.58 --> 02:50:03.58
that's why I refer to these questions as calibrated questions

2101
02:50:03.58 --> 02:50:07.58
you have to calibrate them carefully just like you would calibrate a gun sight

2102
02:50:07.58 --> 02:50:10.58
or a measuring scale to target a specific problem

2103
02:50:10.58 --> 02:50:12.58
the good news is that there are rules for that

2104
02:50:12.58 --> 02:50:18.58
first off calibrated questions avoid verbs like can is are do or does

2105
02:50:18.58 --> 02:50:22.58
these are close ended questions that can be answered with a simple yes or no

2106
02:50:22.58 --> 02:50:27.58
instead they start with a list of words people know as reporters questions

2107
02:50:27.58 --> 02:50:30.58
who, what, when, where, why and how

2108
02:50:30.58 --> 02:50:34.58
those words inspire your counterpart to think and then speak expansively

2109
02:50:34.58 --> 02:50:42.58
but let me cut that list even further it's best to start with what, how and sometimes why

2110
02:50:42.58 --> 02:50:47.58
nothing else who, when and where will often just get your counterpart to share a fact without thinking

2111
02:50:47.58 --> 02:50:53.58
and why can backfire regardless of what the language, what language the word why is translated into

2112
02:50:53.58 --> 02:50:59.58
it's accusatory there are very rare moments when this is to your advantage

2113
02:50:59.58 --> 02:51:05.58
the only time you can use why successfully is when defending, when defensiveness that is created

2114
02:51:05.58 --> 02:51:08.58
supports the change you are trying to get them to see

2115
02:51:08.58 --> 02:51:14.58
why would you ever change from the way you've always done things to try my approach as an example

2116
02:51:14.58 --> 02:51:26.58
so I found this very useful because you know I often talk about something from a military perspective

2117
02:51:26.58 --> 02:51:29.58
called the indirect approach which means I don't want to attack you head on

2118
02:51:29.58 --> 02:51:33.58
I want to, you know, I want to attack you from a flank where you're not defensive

2119
02:51:33.58 --> 02:51:37.58
and this applies to everything it applies to leadership it applies to approaching people

2120
02:51:37.58 --> 02:51:42.58
it applies to, you know, if you've got an ego which everyone does and I attack your plan

2121
02:51:42.58 --> 02:51:44.58
that means I'm attacking your ego you're going to get defensive

2122
02:51:44.58 --> 02:51:49.58
so, you know, often times it's in order to get around your ego

2123
02:51:49.58 --> 02:51:52.58
I'm going to ask you earnest questions about the situation

2124
02:51:52.58 --> 02:51:58.58
but the key thing that you've got here is I don't say well why do you think this is a good plan

2125
02:51:58.58 --> 02:52:00.58
because that's an accusatory question

2126
02:52:00.58 --> 02:52:09.58
instead I'm a better question would be hey can you help me understand the outcome that you're looking for with this plan

2127
02:52:09.58 --> 02:52:14.58
and all of a sudden we've got, we've taken away any possibility that you can see that I'm accusing

2128
02:52:14.58 --> 02:52:19.58
or attacking your plan which thereby is attacking your ego

2129
02:52:19.58 --> 02:52:24.58
how did you come across this calibrated questions idea?

2130
02:52:24.58 --> 02:52:30.58
Camps book 2002 he called them interrogatives, the reporters questions

2131
02:52:30.58 --> 02:52:35.58
and the FBI we called them just open ended, you know the list, who, what, when, when, how and why

2132
02:52:35.58 --> 02:52:41.58
and I noticed that he leaned heavily on one in particular which was

2133
02:52:41.58 --> 02:52:44.58
what's the biggest challenge you face?

2134
02:52:44.58 --> 02:52:50.58
Now, and realize that at the time, first of all it's a white question

2135
02:52:50.58 --> 02:52:54.58
what's differential people like to be asked what to do?

2136
02:52:54.58 --> 02:53:03.58
Secondly, now we now know in a black swan method what is principally designed to uncover problems

2137
02:53:03.58 --> 02:53:05.58
what's the biggest challenge you face?

2138
02:53:05.58 --> 02:53:07.58
What gets in the way?

2139
02:53:07.58 --> 02:53:11.58
I'm coaching some dentists recently

2140
02:53:11.58 --> 02:53:16.58
people are balking at how much their dental work is going to cost

2141
02:53:16.58 --> 02:53:20.58
the question is what happens if you do nothing?

2142
02:53:20.58 --> 02:53:23.58
You know it's a what question, it's differential

2143
02:53:23.58 --> 02:53:28.58
and so then we begin to look harder at the questions

2144
02:53:28.58 --> 02:53:33.58
I thought that was the only overlap between business and hostage negotiation at the time

2145
02:53:33.58 --> 02:53:37.58
then the Burnham case in the Philippines

2146
02:53:37.58 --> 02:53:41.58
it goes bad train wreck all the way around

2147
02:53:41.58 --> 02:53:46.58
and somebody got proof of life on our hostages in the midst of that case

2148
02:53:46.58 --> 02:53:50.58
and I'm just going to blow my mind

2149
02:53:50.58 --> 02:53:53.58
because a hostage was overheard on a phone

2150
02:53:53.58 --> 02:53:56.58
and I'd never gotten a hostage on a phone

2151
02:53:56.58 --> 02:54:00.58
so between how does somebody get a hostage on a phone

2152
02:54:00.58 --> 02:54:03.58
and who the heck is getting proof of life on our hostages

2153
02:54:03.58 --> 02:54:05.58
like there was more than one buyer

2154
02:54:05.58 --> 02:54:07.58
like I didn't know what to do with this

2155
02:54:07.58 --> 02:54:11.58
so the case is an ongoing 13 month long train wreck

2156
02:54:11.58 --> 02:54:16.58
a lot of people died including two out of three of the total Americans that were taken

2157
02:54:16.58 --> 02:54:21.58
listen to a drug dealer kidnapping in Pittsburgh a few months afterwards

2158
02:54:21.58 --> 02:54:23.58
drug dealer on drug dealer

2159
02:54:23.58 --> 02:54:26.58
one drug dealer's got the other drug dealer's girlfriend hostage

2160
02:54:26.58 --> 02:54:29.58
who do you go when somebody important to you has been kidnapped

2161
02:54:29.58 --> 02:54:33.58
even if you're a drug dealer you go to the FBI

2162
02:54:33.58 --> 02:54:35.58
so our hostage negotiator is right around

2163
02:54:35.58 --> 02:54:39.58
listen to the drug dealer talk to the other drug dealer

2164
02:54:39.58 --> 02:54:42.58
and just on his own he goes

2165
02:54:42.58 --> 02:54:48.58
hey dog how do I know she's okay

2166
02:54:48.58 --> 02:54:51.58
and the change in the tone of voice

2167
02:54:51.58 --> 02:54:54.58
the kidnapper drug dealer went from thinking he was in charge

2168
02:54:54.58 --> 02:54:58.58
to being having lost all control of negotiation

2169
02:54:58.58 --> 02:55:00.58
and not knowing it at the time

2170
02:55:00.58 --> 02:55:02.58
and it was just a how question

2171
02:55:02.58 --> 02:55:06.58
so then we changed all of our negotiation

2172
02:55:06.58 --> 02:55:10.58
kidnapping strategy to how and what questions

2173
02:55:10.58 --> 02:55:12.58
just hammering them with how and what questions

2174
02:55:12.58 --> 02:55:16.58
because you want to test it out on the kidnapping

2175
02:55:16.58 --> 02:55:20.58
and finally I'm coaching on another kidnapping in the Philippines

2176
02:55:20.58 --> 02:55:25.58
coaching a brother his brother's been grabbed by a serial killer

2177
02:55:25.58 --> 02:55:27.58
loan kidnapper

2178
02:55:27.58 --> 02:55:30.58
only time in my entire experience

2179
02:55:30.58 --> 02:55:34.58
with one kidnapper they're always operating gangs

2180
02:55:34.58 --> 02:55:38.58
and the guy was a we found out after the fact because we caught him

2181
02:55:38.58 --> 02:55:43.58
he was a multiple kidnappings and it killed at least well

2182
02:55:43.58 --> 02:55:46.58
didn't have the evidence that he killed a hostage in another case

2183
02:55:46.58 --> 02:55:49.58
just a ransom was paid and the hostage never appeared

2184
02:55:49.58 --> 02:55:52.58
so there's only one conclusion

2185
02:55:52.58 --> 02:55:57.58
we're coaching a brother again a good guy who would learn

2186
02:55:57.58 --> 02:56:01.58
pick up fast how and what questions how and what questions how and what questions

2187
02:56:01.58 --> 02:56:08.58
and at one point in time the kidnapper wants a daily prudence to keep the hostage alive

2188
02:56:08.58 --> 02:56:14.58
which we had to fight over that because it's a way to test financial resources

2189
02:56:14.58 --> 02:56:16.58
not to keep the hostage alive

2190
02:56:16.58 --> 02:56:19.58
test the family's resources

2191
02:56:19.58 --> 02:56:21.58
so on his own the brother says

2192
02:56:21.58 --> 02:56:26.58
when we run out of money paying the daily amount

2193
02:56:26.58 --> 02:56:30.58
what's going to happen

2194
02:56:30.58 --> 02:56:36.58
and there's a silence and a serial killer on the other end of the phone says

2195
02:56:36.58 --> 02:56:39.58
it'll be alright

2196
02:56:39.58 --> 02:56:43.58
my negotiators in country call me they think we got a positive breakthrough today

2197
02:56:43.58 --> 02:56:46.58
I'm not sure what it is

2198
02:56:46.58 --> 02:56:49.58
and they told me that I said this guy just promised never to kill a hostage

2199
02:56:49.58 --> 02:56:54.58
like I had no idea that it was a lone guy I thought we were just talking to the boss

2200
02:56:54.58 --> 02:56:56.58
didn't know he was a killer

2201
02:56:56.58 --> 02:56:59.58
it was another case where he chopped a victim's ear off

2202
02:56:59.58 --> 02:57:04.58
sent the ear and video of him chopping the ear off to the victims company they got paid

2203
02:57:04.58 --> 02:57:07.58
I knew about that I've been told for a variety of reasons I'd heard about that

2204
02:57:07.58 --> 02:57:10.58
I didn't know it was this guy

2205
02:57:10.58 --> 02:57:13.58
take him completely out of his game

2206
02:57:13.58 --> 02:57:16.58
with a version of what question saw another one

2207
02:57:16.58 --> 02:57:20.58
took another guy completely out of his game with a version of the how question

2208
02:57:20.58 --> 02:57:25.58
and a dynamic where you said we had no leverage

2209
02:57:25.58 --> 02:57:29.58
if you thought in terms of leverage but you got influence

2210
02:57:29.58 --> 02:57:32.58
how do you get influence to deference

2211
02:57:32.58 --> 02:57:38.58
and that's when we really began to dial in collectively principally my son Brandon and I

2212
02:57:38.58 --> 02:57:42.58
got Derek Gawant very involved in the development of our thinking

2213
02:57:42.58 --> 02:57:46.58
and we really narrowed it down to how and what

2214
02:57:46.58 --> 02:57:50.58
is a way to really get the upper hand in a negotiation

2215
02:57:55.58 --> 02:58:00.58
fast forward a little bit here you got a couple things that are awesome points

2216
02:58:00.58 --> 02:58:05.58
don't try to force your opponent to admit that you are right

2217
02:58:05.58 --> 02:58:09.58
aggressive confrontation is the enemy of constructive negotiation

2218
02:58:09.58 --> 02:58:13.58
I always say when you're dealing with someone give them an out

2219
02:58:13.58 --> 02:58:18.58
you just give them an out you can say seems like this is the best way to do it

2220
02:58:18.58 --> 02:58:21.58
but I know you're smart on this stuff too does it make sense

2221
02:58:21.58 --> 02:58:24.58
and they go yeah you know go ahead and do it that way

2222
02:58:24.58 --> 02:58:28.58
you give them an opportunity that they don't have to say I was I'm wrong you're right

2223
02:58:28.58 --> 02:58:31.58
go do it your way no never do that

2224
02:58:31.58 --> 02:58:36.58
and the other one again this isn't just for negotiation

2225
02:58:36.58 --> 02:58:39.58
this is for life bite your tongue

2226
02:58:39.58 --> 02:58:42.58
when you're attacked in a negotiation

2227
02:58:42.58 --> 02:58:47.58
pause and avoid angry emotional reactions instead ask your counterpart

2228
02:58:47.58 --> 02:58:50.58
a calibrated question

2229
02:58:50.58 --> 02:58:56.58
just such a solid move that will keep you out of trouble

2230
02:58:56.58 --> 02:58:59.58
you want to say something back

2231
02:58:59.58 --> 02:59:03.58
you know I actually go I tell people you know someone starts attacking you or someone

2232
02:59:03.58 --> 02:59:06.58
someone starts getting aggressive with you you know take a step back

2233
02:59:06.58 --> 02:59:09.58
kind of nod your head show them that you're listening

2234
02:59:09.58 --> 02:59:12.58
don't say anything back to them instead ask them a question

2235
02:59:12.58 --> 02:59:17.58
you know that's going to be a good way to go forward

2236
02:59:17.58 --> 02:59:24.58
the 738 55% rule

2237
02:59:24.58 --> 02:59:30.58
and two famous studies on what makes us like or dislike somebody UCLA psychology professor

2238
02:59:30.58 --> 02:59:33.58
Albert Mayhabrian

2239
02:59:33.58 --> 02:59:35.58
totally murdered that one

2240
02:59:35.58 --> 02:59:36.58
you're not Persian

2241
02:59:36.58 --> 02:59:37.58
I'm not

2242
02:59:37.58 --> 02:59:39.58
you know how to say that if you're a Persian

2243
02:59:39.58 --> 02:59:40.58
I don't know how to say it either

2244
02:59:40.58 --> 02:59:41.58
Myhrabian

2245
02:59:41.58 --> 02:59:42.58
okay we'll go with it

2246
02:59:42.58 --> 02:59:43.58
that's good

2247
02:59:43.58 --> 02:59:45.58
sorry there Albert we'll call him Albert

2248
02:59:45.58 --> 02:59:46.58
Dr. Albert

2249
02:59:46.58 --> 02:59:49.58
created the 738 55 rule

2250
02:59:49.58 --> 02:59:56.58
only 7% of a message is based on the words while 38% comes from the tone of the voice

2251
02:59:56.58 --> 03:00:00.58
and 55% from the speaker's body language and face

2252
03:00:00.58 --> 03:00:04.58
while these figures mainly relate to situations where we are forming an attitude about someone

2253
03:00:04.58 --> 03:00:08.58
the rule nonetheless offers a useful ratio for negotiators

2254
03:00:08.58 --> 03:00:15.58
you see body language and tone of voice not words are our most powerful assessment tools

2255
03:00:15.58 --> 03:00:21.58
important to remember that

2256
03:00:21.58 --> 03:00:23.58
important to pay attention

2257
03:00:23.58 --> 03:00:27.58
a lot of us a lot a lot of people

2258
03:00:27.58 --> 03:00:32.58
your face it gives away so much and it doesn't even matter what you're saying

2259
03:00:32.58 --> 03:00:37.58
the look that you have on your face is just giving away the way you feel

2260
03:00:37.58 --> 03:00:39.58
and it doesn't even matter what your words are

2261
03:00:39.58 --> 03:00:46.58
did you feel like you had to learn to you know control your facial expressions

2262
03:00:46.58 --> 03:00:50.58
my business partner and my friend Leif Babin

2263
03:00:50.58 --> 03:00:56.58
you know he when we first started working together when he was pissed

2264
03:00:56.58 --> 03:00:59.58
you knew it and so did everybody else

2265
03:00:59.58 --> 03:01:03.58
it was like his face would turn red you could see how mad he was

2266
03:01:03.58 --> 03:01:08.58
and you know over time you know as you know he started to realize that that didn't help him

2267
03:01:08.58 --> 03:01:12.58
started to learn how to not do that

2268
03:01:12.58 --> 03:01:18.58
is that something that you see people have to recognize and then get themselves trained up on

2269
03:01:18.58 --> 03:01:24.58
yeah and depending upon the person there's underlying currents

2270
03:01:24.58 --> 03:01:28.58
so it could be for different reasons

2271
03:01:28.58 --> 03:01:30.58
the short answer is yes

2272
03:01:30.58 --> 03:01:36.58
and the longer answer is how do you align your thinking in the moment

2273
03:01:36.58 --> 03:01:41.58
a little bit of what you mentioned earlier like if you're really interested in what the other person is saying

2274
03:01:41.58 --> 03:01:45.58
and then you worry about evaluating after the fact you don't have to worry about the look on your face

2275
03:01:45.58 --> 03:01:52.58
as a matter of fact if you're really interested the more interested you look the more they're going to talk

2276
03:01:52.58 --> 03:01:58.58
so if you can separate the two things out from evaluating judging what somebody said to just being

2277
03:01:58.58 --> 03:02:02.58
making sure you fully understand then facial expressions are not a problem

2278
03:02:02.58 --> 03:02:08.58
the people that have a problem with them and you know your guys faces turn red

2279
03:02:08.58 --> 03:02:16.58
making all that's a characteristic principally of the assertive negotiator who can't wait to disagree

2280
03:02:16.58 --> 03:02:20.58
and is holding it in

2281
03:02:20.58 --> 03:02:23.58
the highly analytical type

2282
03:02:23.58 --> 03:02:28.58
you know the people that seem completely emotionally detached

2283
03:02:28.58 --> 03:02:32.58
when they think you're not looking they reveal everything

2284
03:02:32.58 --> 03:02:40.58
and like their facial expressions their body language I mean they almost sometimes they look like they're twitching

2285
03:02:40.58 --> 03:02:48.58
and so if you know who's highly analytical if you're faced with a team of people

2286
03:02:48.58 --> 03:02:54.58
do not talk to the analytical guy or gal but keep an eye on them

2287
03:02:54.58 --> 03:02:59.58
you gotta kind of watch them out of the corner you're right because they're going to be rolling their eyes

2288
03:02:59.58 --> 03:03:03.58
and they're going to be sneaking peaks at people and moments

2289
03:03:03.58 --> 03:03:08.58
I mean like they are the most honest most unguarded body language you ever saw in your life

2290
03:03:08.58 --> 03:03:10.58
if they don't think they're being stared at

2291
03:03:10.58 --> 03:03:17.58
let me ask you this so I've been talking about leadership you're talking about you write about negotiation

2292
03:03:17.58 --> 03:03:24.58
how much interaction because there's also a ton of similarities with interrogators

2293
03:03:24.58 --> 03:03:30.58
how much interaction did you have with interrogators I mean I obviously worked with a ton of interrogators

2294
03:03:30.58 --> 03:03:35.58
and a bunch of different organizations how much work did you do with interrogators

2295
03:03:35.58 --> 03:03:40.58
fair amount and there's probably about three schools of thought out there

2296
03:03:40.58 --> 03:03:51.58
the great well the bad ones are just brute force you know I'm going to make you uncomfortable physically or emotionally

2297
03:03:51.58 --> 03:03:56.58
and I'm going to try to force something out of you and that's just that just doesn't work

2298
03:03:56.58 --> 03:04:02.58
it's counter it's counterproductive if you if you only care about what works then you won't be harsh

2299
03:04:02.58 --> 03:04:09.58
because it doesn't work now the other two that are left there's one thing called the listening information

2300
03:04:09.58 --> 03:04:13.58
which there are a fair amount of interrogators out there that like it

2301
03:04:13.58 --> 03:04:19.58
and they they want to get you into a very short term mindset and get you to say things that you know to be against your interests

2302
03:04:19.58 --> 03:04:25.58
the problem is if you're getting somebody into a short term mindset they're going to come a point in time when they regret saying it to you

2303
03:04:25.58 --> 03:04:29.58
and you're going to lose their cooperation everything's going to fall apart so it has a shelf life

2304
03:04:29.58 --> 03:04:36.58
now the rapport based people those are the magic magic magicians

2305
03:04:36.58 --> 03:04:41.58
that make cases nobody else can make or make deals no one else can make

2306
03:04:41.58 --> 03:04:44.58
and the other side still wants to talk to them

2307
03:04:44.58 --> 03:04:52.58
like when I left surveillance in New York and went inside to investigate what we were talking earlier became an inside you know

2308
03:04:52.58 --> 03:05:04.58
open investigator I was surrounded by guys that had gotten cooperation from witnesses voluntarily that people would just say like

2309
03:05:04.58 --> 03:05:10.58
I got no idea how that guy got that cooperation one agent particularly his name is Larry Wack

2310
03:05:10.58 --> 03:05:21.58
and even on the task force people admired how he got people to cooperate because he was he was he developed a rapport relationships with people

2311
03:05:21.58 --> 03:05:31.58
even if he had a hammer the rapport and the relationship you know the belief that we will always be able to talk to one another

2312
03:05:31.58 --> 03:05:37.58
as opposed to me tricking you into a short term mindset which at some point in time you're going to feel betrayed

2313
03:05:37.58 --> 03:05:44.58
like the rapport based approach to deal making interrogation wins every time

2314
03:05:44.58 --> 03:05:48.58
same thing with leadership we might as well throw leadership in there as well

2315
03:05:48.58 --> 03:05:55.58
agree the time I say well you know if you don't do this I'm going to fire you or whatever it'll work for that task

2316
03:05:55.58 --> 03:06:04.58
but eventually you're looking for another job so yeah those those similarities building relationships across the board

2317
03:06:04.58 --> 03:06:13.58
so you just mentioned the analyst that's one type of person you got a whole section here about not only you what kind of negotiator are you

2318
03:06:13.58 --> 03:06:19.58
because you got to know yourself but then also how are you going to interact with these people you got the analyst that you talked about

2319
03:06:19.58 --> 03:06:27.58
which is methodical diligent they're not in a big rush you talked about them tell me about the accommodator just

2320
03:06:27.58 --> 03:06:36.58
the so being an assertive the accommodators is weird animal that neither the analysts nor the assertive can really figure out

2321
03:06:36.58 --> 03:06:46.58
but the accommodators really is a very hope based person and very focused on that the moment is pleasant

2322
03:06:46.58 --> 03:06:53.58
and then if the moment is pleasant and we hope hard enough then everything will be fine

2323
03:06:53.58 --> 03:06:59.58
now when we wrote when we wrote the book we said the accommodator was focused principally on the relationship

2324
03:06:59.58 --> 03:07:08.58
having a positive relationship and that's pretty close to true like they want the relationship to be positive but

2325
03:07:08.58 --> 03:07:17.58
you know we worked with people that would see a train coming at us rhetorically

2326
03:07:17.58 --> 03:07:26.58
federal figuratively not literally his problem coming at us this person was on a team and we had a training and all the books that were supposed to be there were gone

2327
03:07:26.58 --> 03:07:37.58
this guy knew about it for days the last minute tells us none of the manuals were here because he'd been and we're like you know this is the train is getting ready to hit us

2328
03:07:37.58 --> 03:07:47.58
we've been here for three days you haven't said a word for three days that's not relationship focus because I'm standing on a railroad track and you see a train coming my way and you're not warning me

2329
03:07:47.58 --> 03:08:00.58
so you know this relationship is coming to a close and then we realize in hindsight and we see it constantly they're hoping something good happens at the last minute everybody's saved

2330
03:08:00.58 --> 03:08:09.58
my colleague Derek would say you know an accommodator walk you into a minefield knowing it's a minefield hoping you don't step on a mine

2331
03:08:09.58 --> 03:08:20.58
and so the accommodators I think are the source of why in the business world people often say hope is not a strategy because the accommodator will go with hope alone

2332
03:08:20.58 --> 03:08:39.58
and it'll work out hope alone is probably good somewhere between 20 and 45% of the time maybe that maybe that's being generous maybe 20% of the time and they're going to remember the 20%

2333
03:08:39.58 --> 03:08:58.58
and ignore the 80% when the world turned into a disaster so the accommodators are really are very positive people they're very upbeat and they're very hope focused which is in and of itself it's not a strategy it's a necessary element you got to be hopeful it's going to work out

2334
03:08:58.58 --> 03:09:13.58
it's what it is is inadequate now simultaneously people love dealing with somebody like that so we'll see on a regular basis the accommodators will make more deals overall than anybody else will

2335
03:09:13.58 --> 03:09:27.58
but there'd be mostly really sloppy deals that are nowhere near as profitable for either side as they should have been because they simply hope that things would fall into place

2336
03:09:27.58 --> 03:09:36.58
and then the last one which I think you just self identified as a assertive so what's the deal with the assertive negotiator

2337
03:09:36.58 --> 03:09:47.58
just honest I'm just being honest with you you know I'm saving you a lot of trouble because I want you to be honest with me so I'm going to be honest with you that was stupid

2338
03:09:47.58 --> 03:09:58.58
that's a dumb idea that's never going to work you didn't think this thing you know the assertive anybody that describes themselves as simply open and honest

2339
03:09:58.58 --> 03:10:08.58
and it's always a punch in the face it's always just that approach like you the other side's got to know where you're coming from you do have to be honest

2340
03:10:08.58 --> 03:10:23.58
but it's how you deliver it and the assertives are the typically the worst and making you I had I had my partner once tell me dealing with you is like getting hit in the face with a brick

2341
03:10:23.58 --> 03:10:33.58
and I remember thinking like how could that be I'm the nicest guy I know

2342
03:10:33.58 --> 03:10:40.58
you know it's like what I said what I talked about earlier like me punching you in the face with the truth is not a good way to get you listen

2343
03:10:40.58 --> 03:10:47.58
exactly echo always brings up the example of the person that says you know I'm just a direct person but I gotta tell you you were totally screwed up and again

2344
03:10:47.58 --> 03:10:57.58
there's not a lot of people like oh thank you for being that direct person telling me how jacked up I am usually a look the occasion to get someone that loves to get coached and love to get told what they

2345
03:10:57.58 --> 03:11:08.58
but yeah you get some people a lot of times it just a friend so that is so so when you take these three different personality types negotiators are we looking to blend

2346
03:11:08.58 --> 03:11:21.58
yes that's what the goal is each type has something really critical they bring to the table the the sort of I mean you gotta tell the aside where you come from otherwise you're making them gas

2347
03:11:21.58 --> 03:11:33.58
you don't make good deals based on guesswork the analyst you gotta think things through you gotta come up with it run some number you don't have to run them all run any run some

2348
03:11:33.58 --> 03:11:47.58
and the accommodator like so many people look at the accommodators and say that person's making tons of deals what are they doing it's in their demeanor it's in their approach

2349
03:11:47.58 --> 03:11:58.58
the just FYI for people that are about to order this book you also kind of give how do you deal with the accommodator how do you deal with the assertive so you give both sides of the spectrum

2350
03:11:58.58 --> 03:12:10.58
fast forward a little bit we mentioned this briefly this this Ackerman bargain bargaining and this is the I call the system the Ackerman Ackerman model because it came from this guy named Mike Ackerman

2351
03:12:10.58 --> 03:12:19.58
the ex CIA guy who founded a kidnap for ransom consulting company based out of Miami on many kidnappings we constantly pair paired with Ackerman guys

2352
03:12:19.58 --> 03:12:28.58
never Mike himself who helped design this Haggle and you lay out this Haggle though how it's a systemized and easy remember process that has only four steps

2353
03:12:28.58 --> 03:12:35.58
well you go to six steps here number one set your target price which is your goal

2354
03:12:35.58 --> 03:12:45.58
then you set your first offer at 65% of your target price then you calculate three raises of decreasing increments 85 95 and 100%

2355
03:12:45.58 --> 03:12:55.58
use lots of empathy in different ways of saying no to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer when calculating the final final amount use precise non round numbers

2356
03:12:55.58 --> 03:13:09.58
37893 rather than 38000 it gives the number credibility and weight on your final number throw a non monetary item that you probably don't want to show you're at your limit

2357
03:13:09.58 --> 03:13:20.58
so this is a pretty cool little system is that is that something you could advise someone to use when they're going to shop for a new car or used car yeah yeah it's not a bad model

2358
03:13:20.58 --> 03:13:31.58
it's if you if you're gonna bargain it's the most effective bargaining model out there nothing beats it

2359
03:13:31.58 --> 03:13:42.58
getting into this last might be the last chapter find the black swan and we haven't mentioned this yet but you've got the black swan group this is your consulting firm

2360
03:13:42.58 --> 03:13:53.58
and quick description of the black swan black swan theory tells us that things happen that were previously thought to be impossible or never thought of it all

2361
03:13:53.58 --> 03:14:03.58
this is not the same as saying that sometimes things happen against a one in a million odds but rather that things never imagined do come to pass

2362
03:14:03.58 --> 03:14:12.58
the idea of the back black swan was popularized by the same to lab in his best selling books fooled by randomness and the black swan

2363
03:14:12.58 --> 03:14:20.58
but the term goes back much further until the 17th century people could only imagine white swans because all swans ever seen had possessed white feathers

2364
03:14:20.58 --> 03:14:34.58
in the 17th century London it was common to refer to impossible things as black swans but when the but then the Dutch explorer William Devlamin sorry people of Holland

2365
03:14:34.58 --> 03:14:49.58
went to Western Australia I did indeed apologies down went to Western Australia in 1697 and saw a black swan suddenly the unthinkable and unthought was real

2366
03:14:49.58 --> 03:14:59.58
this is a crucial concept in negotiation and every negotiation session there are different kinds of information there are those things we know like our counterparts name and their offer and our experiences from other negotiations

2367
03:14:59.58 --> 03:15:09.58
those are known knowns there are those things we are certain that exist but we don't know like possibility that the other side might get sick and leave us without another counterpart

2368
03:15:09.58 --> 03:15:21.58
those are known unknowns and they are like poker wildcards you know they're out there but you don't know who has them but most important are those things we don't know that we don't know

2369
03:15:21.58 --> 03:15:38.58
piece of information we've never imagined that would be game changing if uncovered maybe our counterpart wants the deal to fail because he's leaving for a competitor these unknown unknowns are black swans

2370
03:15:38.58 --> 03:15:48.58
so this is obviously something highly important to you since you named your company the black swan how did you stumble upon this idea

2371
03:15:48.58 --> 03:16:11.58
the first Talib's book in 2007 a black swan got me thinking about it I like his stuff I mean his highly in depth thinker he's got a writing tone that is not for everybody but really in depth and so I saw that the idea like the impact of the highly improbable

2372
03:16:11.58 --> 03:16:21.58
well that's what we did all the time in negotiation it's a combination of two things we're going to change ourselves and subtle little ways that the other side is never going to see and we're going to gain the upper hand

2373
03:16:21.58 --> 03:16:31.58
we're going to steer it we're going to steer the negotiation and to the best possible outcome now that that doesn't mean that everything's going to a positive outcome

2374
03:16:31.58 --> 03:16:45.58
but you got to recognize what the best possible outcome is so it's a great metaphor for making tiny little subtle changes in your negotiation approach the other side is never going to see where you're going to make all the difference it's completely invisible

2375
03:16:45.58 --> 03:17:02.58
and then while you're in the middle of it there's always stuff the great stuff will fall out of the sky if you let it the other side is going to say something that works for you they're going to talk to you they're going to be softer in a position and you realize there's going to be pressures on them that you don't understand

2376
03:17:02.58 --> 03:17:22.58
something is always always there and in many cases the other side doesn't imagine it and to draw a real fine point on this that a lot of people miss it's a reason why reading body language to detect deception is almost a waste of time

2377
03:17:22.58 --> 03:17:35.58
because for you to deceive me you've got to know it's important to have a tell you have to be consciously covering it up but a significant amount of the time you don't even know it's important

2378
03:17:35.58 --> 03:17:55.58
so if I'm just looking for towels and not getting you talking the stuff that you didn't know is important is never going to come out so so what if so what if you're lying number one that doesn't tell me what the truth is and if we're only focused on what you're hiding

2379
03:17:55.58 --> 03:18:17.58
rambling conversation what might that look like a woman who's getting funding for a film she's doing in Los Angeles a couple years ago trying to get $300,000 out of investor very focused on this film being shot in LA very focused on this amount of money very focused on what they're trying to point to trying to make in a film

2380
03:18:17.58 --> 03:18:40.58
but she's mirroring and labeling and out of the blue it comes out that the financier owns a castle in France which would be a great setting for the next film something she never would have brought up the financier they're talking about a film being shot in LA martial arts this and that all these other little things

2381
03:18:40.58 --> 03:18:56.58
you know female martial artists beating up bad guys like how is she gonna say oh by the way you don't have I'm working on another film we want to it's a medieval film you don't have to have a castle in France do you like that is never going to come up ever

2382
03:18:56.58 --> 03:19:16.58
but she's talking and she's labeling and marrying the next thing you know this this this thing comes out that the other person has no idea makes any difference changes the structuring of the whole deal now instead of talking about one film they're talking about multiple films completely changes the complexion of the the finances that are needed on the first

2383
03:19:16.58 --> 03:19:34.58
if she go back out she's already got partial packaging on a second film like it changes everything and there's no way that she would have known to ask it and the person on the other side was well instead of 300 grand what about my castle because that's not going to do any good for a film in LA just little things like that

2384
03:19:34.58 --> 03:19:52.58
one thing that emphasize the importance of listening is you know at one point you're talking about a case you got a guy that's you know drives to drives to Washington DC and a tractor he's gonna blow himself up he's gonna blow up some of the white ones yeah

2385
03:19:52.58 --> 03:20:10.58
and you know he's saying he's gonna blow himself up but when you actually have you're having conversations with him and you've got multiple people listening right because listening is so important that if you look if you can get more more than one person you get two or three or four people listening to the conversation

2386
03:20:10.58 --> 03:20:38.58
and they're gonna pick things up that someone else might miss and studying the transcript so you had someone on the team that realize number one he was a veteran how can we utilize that and then someone realized he was like a I don't want to say fundamentalist Christian but a very strong Christian and you had a certain religious thing going on so you able to utilize these things that people caught just through listening and it changed the dynamics of the whole of the whole negotiation

2387
03:20:38.58 --> 03:20:58.58
right right kept him from getting killed got him out a day early and so that was you know short in a timeline because he was he was really at the end of his rope and each hour went by had less sleep which increases the likelihood that he's gonna do some stupid we're still not 100% sure that there are bombs there

2388
03:20:58.58 --> 03:21:12.58
and so if he'd made a particular move towards where the possibility yet he had his Jeep and a flatbed they said we don't know their own explosives in a Jeep and a flatbed if he goes there we got to take him out

2389
03:21:12.58 --> 03:21:36.58
and we're talking to him and this comes up and he's agreed to come out 72 hours we want to cut try to cut 24 off of it and one of the female negotiators when he Miller says you know tell him to Mazadon of the third day which is 48 hours and I'll come out

2390
03:21:36.58 --> 03:21:58.58
and he had talked so much about the military and his 82nd Airborne experience somebody else listening heard the underlying strong Christian beliefs in his religion if you will everybody's got a religion everybody everybody he's got a religion just to put up on what it is and how broadly you define it

2391
03:21:58.58 --> 03:22:08.58
just gonna hit some of these last section of the book I'll cover but I just want to hit some of these highlights here

2392
03:22:08.58 --> 03:22:34.58
let what you know your known knowns guide you but not blind you every case is new so remain flexible and adaptable black swans are leverage multipliers remember the three types of leverage and you go over these in the book positive which is the ability to give someone what they want negative the ability to hurt someone and normative using your counterparts norms to bring them around

2393
03:22:34.58 --> 03:22:45.58
again there's more detail on the book inside the book work to understand the other sides religion what you just mentioned everybody's got a religion

2394
03:22:45.58 --> 03:22:57.58
digging into worldviews inherently implies moving beyond negotiation table and into life emotional and otherwise of your counterpart that's where black black swans live

2395
03:22:57.58 --> 03:23:15.58
you know you hear everything you hear from your counterpart you will not hear everything the first time so double check compare notes with team members use backup listeners exploit the similarity principle people are more apt to concede to someone when they share a culture someone they share a cultural similarity with

2396
03:23:15.58 --> 03:23:35.58
you know dig for what makes them tick and show that you share common ground when someone seems irrational or crazy they most likely aren't faced with the situation search for constraints hidden desires and bad information and last get face time with your counterpart 10 minutes of face time often reveals

2397
03:23:35.58 --> 03:23:51.58
than days of research pay special attention to your counterparts verbal and non verbal communication at unguarded moments at the beginning and the end of the session or when someone says something out of line

2398
03:23:51.58 --> 03:24:12.58
so really good really just awesome points that apply to me they apply to business they apply to interacting with any human obviously they apply to negotiations but there you go I mean we hit the the wave tops of some of the last I mean probably read less than 5% of this book

2399
03:24:12.58 --> 03:24:33.58
so many good stories and again I felt I feel kind of bad that I skipped a lot of the lot of the stories themselves but get the book and then that way you can hear some of the examples behind this so what so what so what are you up to right now what we got we got the black swan group right

2400
03:24:33.58 --> 03:24:43.58
yeah we're coaching and training negotiations some of all the companies out there you get training from very few more culture which sort of shocks me

2401
03:24:43.58 --> 03:24:53.58
like how do you how do you how do you not believe in your stuff enough where you you'll you'll coach I mean literally the real definition of a coach is somebody

2402
03:24:53.58 --> 03:25:10.58
you go into the game but the coaches right there prepping you you come out of the game you could talk like how do you teach this stuff and not be willing to coach it and so we coach across the board it's a much bigger aspect of the business

2403
03:25:10.58 --> 03:25:27.58
than I ever thought it would be we got a just finished the documentary film called tactical empathy looking premiered at Beverly Hills about 10 days ago taking our time on a distribution deal see what happens with that

2404
03:25:27.58 --> 03:25:56.58
outlining a lot of stuff is it full full length documentary 54 minutes 54 minute documentary got a book for real estate agents the full fee agent coming out Steve Schull the guy that did the book with me interesting cat I know Steve for well over a year before I find out he played in the NFL like most NFL guys you know the first five minutes

2405
03:25:56.58 --> 03:26:14.58
not only that Steve was a Super Bowl captain. He didn't just play in the NFL he is playing on a team that went to the Super Bowl he was a captain of the team. I think I finally found that out after I knew him like four years like he just he doesn't

2406
03:26:14.58 --> 03:26:35.58
he doesn't lead with that stuff. But understand the value of coaching because he played for Don Schula he played for some real coaches. So he shares a coaching philosophy that you know the stuff that we coach you on if you do what we ask you to do it's going to work.

2407
03:26:35.58 --> 03:26:46.58
So the full fee agents coming out about two months and then my son Brandon and I and another colleague are working on a follow up to never split the difference should be at about a year. Nice.

2408
03:26:46.58 --> 03:27:02.58
Yeah the coaching piece. I always tell people with with leadership it's not an inoculation you don't just get like a shot and now you're good now you get it. You don't go to the gym one time and now you're in shape you don't pick up a guitar get taught and now you know how to play it. It's the same thing with the

2409
03:27:02.58 --> 03:27:17.58
go you're not going to say oh I read the book and now I'm good to go. No you actually need to train it you need to get coached on it. That's why that's why you got to do that follow up. So that's awesome. We do the same thing at our company. I mean most of the companies that we work with we do long term

2410
03:27:17.58 --> 03:27:36.58
engagements with them. Black Swan LTD dot com. That's what that's where people if they want coaching if they want to get deeper on this stuff you're also on social media. You got on Facebook and Instagram you're at black swan LTD.

That's how good you are. Get in there and sign up for that. That seems that's like it's up us up to present day. Yeah. Masterclass is out there. You know you and I were talking earlier about the masterclass is good.

2418
03:29:11.58 --> 03:29:24.58
It's also it's insane how cheap that is as far as costs like the masterclass might be the best deal on earth and my negotiation course and a whole bunch of other cool stuff.

2419
03:29:24.58 --> 03:29:34.58
I got a course and so it's got a course like if whatever you want to learn you're going to find it on masterclass. So you're on there as well. Awesome. All right.

2420
03:29:34.58 --> 03:29:43.58
Well now you know what time it is. Echo Charles. Yes. Do you have any questions. Yes. Oh here we go. What do you I took the masterclass by the way. Very help very good.

2421
03:29:43.58 --> 03:29:56.58
Very well done. What's your thoughts on like good the whole good cop bad cop interrogation. Anything that's a manipulation or were you not being genuine and honest.

2422
03:29:56.58 --> 03:30:06.58
And if you're good cop bad cop you're probably one of you's play acting. Yeah. And it's as a long term strategy like you might get short term what you need.

2423
03:30:06.58 --> 03:30:15.58
But you're always going to find always going to find you need long term cooperation and to engage in something that's guaranteed to cause it to go bad.

2424
03:30:15.58 --> 03:30:23.58
Is not just from a mercenary standpoint you don't do stuff you know it's going to hurt you in the long run.

2425
03:30:23.58 --> 03:30:34.58
So back to the accommodator. So if I'm running late not that I ever run late but hypothetically if I'm running late and then jockeau text me how long.

2426
03:30:34.58 --> 03:30:42.58
Is it going to be till you get here. And I know probably it's going to be like 20 minutes probably but I say in my head.

2427
03:30:42.58 --> 03:30:50.58
If there's no traffic lights stopping me if traffic is good I could probably be there in six. So I tell him about five minutes.

2428
03:30:50.58 --> 03:30:58.58
Because I want to avoid giving him the bad news up front. It seems saying that I'm hopeful that I make it in the five. Is that me being the accommodator.

2429
03:30:58.58 --> 03:31:07.58
Yeah I think so and I think that's probably one of the biggest mistakes people make on a regular basis constantly like and the fix is the opposite.

2430
03:31:07.58 --> 03:31:11.58
Like if you know if you know you're 20 minutes away tell him 25.

2431
03:31:11.58 --> 03:31:16.58
Yeah here's my thinking if I would ever that ever were ever to happen.

2432
03:31:16.58 --> 03:31:21.58
I'm thinking I give him the good news so he's not that mad at me.

2433
03:31:21.58 --> 03:31:28.58
So if I give him the worst possible news for that 10 minutes or whatever he's gonna be mad.

2434
03:31:28.58 --> 03:31:34.58
Then he's already mad when I walk in there but if the small chance arises that I get there in the five minutes.

2435
03:31:34.58 --> 03:31:36.58
Easy money.

2436
03:31:36.58 --> 03:31:39.58
Yeah that's how it plays on your head.

2437
03:31:39.58 --> 03:31:42.58
And that is so common.

2438
03:31:42.58 --> 03:31:45.58
My girlfriend is an accommodator.

2439
03:31:45.58 --> 03:31:51.58
She's a wonderful human being brilliant entrepreneur like so many things about her that are just brilliant.

2440
03:31:51.58 --> 03:31:54.58
She's gorgeous.

2441
03:31:54.58 --> 03:32:00.58
I'm talking to her on the phone the other day she's having you know she's nice enough she's in the middle of the zoom call she takes a call anyway.

2442
03:32:00.58 --> 03:32:05.58
She says hey I'm in the middle of business call I'll carry you back in 15 minutes.

2443
03:32:05.58 --> 03:32:07.58
I go OK.

2444
03:32:07.58 --> 03:32:11.58
And then that night I called her and I said that was the longest 15 minutes I ever heard.

2445
03:32:11.58 --> 03:32:16.58
Like I didn't I knew when somebody gives me a vague amount of time and it's not just her anybody.

2446
03:32:16.58 --> 03:32:22.58
I go on about my day because you're trying to be nice.

2447
03:32:22.58 --> 03:32:27.58
You know you're trying really hard to keep the other person from being in a bad place.

2448
03:32:27.58 --> 03:32:33.58
And time after time after time after time the lights are not all in line.

2449
03:32:33.58 --> 03:32:41.58
And the data that you get overwhelmingly says that's going to go bad and they're almost everybody still does it.

2450
03:32:41.58 --> 03:32:45.58
That was one of my favorite stories from McCraven's book Sea Stories.

2451
03:32:45.58 --> 03:32:48.58
And you might have been one of those guys out there.

2452
03:32:48.58 --> 03:32:53.58
They're running some op in a Caribbean and a helicopter is a late picking them up.

2453
03:32:53.58 --> 03:32:56.58
And they are not outfitted for the water temperature.

2454
03:32:56.58 --> 03:32:59.58
Water is warm but it still ain't ninety eight point six.

2455
03:32:59.58 --> 03:33:02.58
And a chopper is one of the choppers going to show.

2456
03:33:02.58 --> 03:33:06.58
And a chopper is 15 minutes.

2457
03:33:06.58 --> 03:33:08.58
And they were there for three hours.

2458
03:33:08.58 --> 03:33:12.58
They would you know and that's that's that's not a military op.

2459
03:33:12.58 --> 03:33:16.58
That's human beings trying to be nice to other human beings.

2460
03:33:16.58 --> 03:33:20.58
And I you know it just doesn't work out.

2461
03:33:20.58 --> 03:33:26.58
So the flip side is overestimate the time.

2462
03:33:26.58 --> 03:33:31.58
You tell him 25 minutes you're here in 20 he's delighted with you.

2463
03:33:31.58 --> 03:33:33.58
He thinks you're great.

2464
03:33:33.58 --> 03:33:35.58
Delighted might be a strong.

2465
03:33:35.58 --> 03:33:39.58
But I'll tell you you know someone else the airlines do this.

2466
03:33:39.58 --> 03:33:40.58
Oh yeah.

2467
03:33:40.58 --> 03:33:41.58
There's a last time.

2468
03:33:41.58 --> 03:33:47.58
No but the opposite now they caught on because their biggest criticism was whether or not their planes are late.

2469
03:33:47.58 --> 03:33:50.58
So it doesn't matter what airline it is.

2470
03:33:50.58 --> 03:33:52.58
I fly all the time.

2471
03:33:52.58 --> 03:33:56.58
Plane lands and they go like well our gates not open yet.

2472
03:33:56.58 --> 03:33:59.58
So we got to wait another 20 minutes before we get at the gate.

2473
03:33:59.58 --> 03:34:06.58
And the first couple of times that happened I remember and I said out loud in the airport was it a surprise that we showed up.

2474
03:34:06.58 --> 03:34:08.58
Like this plane is really big.

2475
03:34:08.58 --> 03:34:10.58
I know they picked it up on radar.

2476
03:34:10.58 --> 03:34:12.58
They saw us coming from a long way away.

2477
03:34:12.58 --> 03:34:14.58
How is the gate still occupied.

2478
03:34:14.58 --> 03:34:17.58
We're not here as a surprise.

2479
03:34:17.58 --> 03:34:21.58
The airline knew all along when they were going to get there.

2480
03:34:21.58 --> 03:34:25.58
But to fool you they told you they were going to be there at three o'clock.

2481
03:34:25.58 --> 03:34:27.58
You made your plans around three o'clock.

2482
03:34:27.58 --> 03:34:30.58
The airline at two thirty which is a half an hour early.

2483
03:34:30.58 --> 03:34:31.58
You think the airline is great.

2484
03:34:31.58 --> 03:34:34.58
You're mad at the airport.

2485
03:34:34.58 --> 03:34:38.58
Nobody ever blames the airline knew all along when they were really going to get there.

2486
03:34:38.58 --> 03:34:44.58
So when you show up early when you overestimate at the time the people you're doing business with love you.

2487
03:34:44.58 --> 03:34:45.58
They think you're fantastic.

2488
03:34:45.58 --> 03:34:49.58
You put time back in their day.

2489
03:34:49.58 --> 03:34:52.58
This thing goes deep man.

2490
03:34:52.58 --> 03:34:59.58
Plus just like building a relationship with people more you tell them things that's really going to happen.

2491
03:34:59.58 --> 03:35:02.58
You know the higher the trust level goes.

2492
03:35:02.58 --> 03:35:07.58
As opposed to telling someone you're going to be there in six minutes and you show up in sixteen minutes.

2493
03:35:07.58 --> 03:35:09.58
Over time.

2494
03:35:09.58 --> 03:35:12.58
This is a hypothetical.

2495
03:35:12.58 --> 03:35:18.58
What about if someone has food in their teeth and you don't want to tell them accommodate it right.

2496
03:35:18.58 --> 03:35:20.58
Yeah that's going to go bad.

2497
03:35:20.58 --> 03:35:22.58
You got to know right.

2498
03:35:22.58 --> 03:35:23.58
Just got to tell them right.

2499
03:35:23.58 --> 03:35:27.58
It helps them out big picture but you don't want to deliver that bad news is kind of the deal.

2500
03:35:27.58 --> 03:35:30.58
That's the plight right of the accommodator just hopeful.

2501
03:35:30.58 --> 03:35:35.58
If you're like fall out and no one has to say if you're over there trying to figure out if you're an accommodator or not.

2502
03:35:35.58 --> 03:35:39.58
I'm going to go ahead and say let's solve that riddle for you right now.

2503
03:35:39.58 --> 03:35:41.58
You're an accommodator for sure.

2504
03:35:41.58 --> 03:35:43.58
Hey we're all doing the best we can.

2505
03:35:43.58 --> 03:35:45.58
Right on right on anything else.

2506
03:35:45.58 --> 03:35:46.58
Charles that is it is honor.

2507
03:35:46.58 --> 03:35:47.58
I followed you.

2508
03:35:47.58 --> 03:35:50.58
I actually got that book right when it came out.

2509
03:35:50.58 --> 03:35:51.58
Thank you.

2510
03:35:51.58 --> 03:35:52.58
That's cool.

2511
03:35:52.58 --> 03:35:53.58
I appreciate it.

2512
03:35:53.58 --> 03:35:54.58
When did the book come out.

2513
03:35:54.58 --> 03:35:55.58
2016.

2514
03:35:55.58 --> 03:35:56.58
Been out for a while.

2515
03:35:56.58 --> 03:35:57.58
Awesome.

2516
03:35:57.58 --> 03:36:00.58
Chris any closing thoughts from you.

2517
03:36:00.58 --> 03:36:05.58
No I've enjoyed the conversation.

2518
03:36:05.58 --> 03:36:13.58
Delighted at how thoroughly you understand how this applies to leadership and everything else.

2519
03:36:13.58 --> 03:36:16.58
I mean you've seen a parallels right away.

2520
03:36:16.58 --> 03:36:22.58
You know I've listened to your other podcast where you talk about like you know I left high school not educated dude.

2521
03:36:22.58 --> 03:36:24.58
But you're a learner.

2522
03:36:24.58 --> 03:36:26.58
Which is really cool.

2523
03:36:26.58 --> 03:36:27.58
Which is really cool.

2524
03:36:27.58 --> 03:36:28.58
Well thank you.

2525
03:36:28.58 --> 03:36:29.58
Appreciate it.

2526
03:36:29.58 --> 03:36:31.58
And thanks for coming on.

2527
03:36:31.58 --> 03:36:32.58
Thanks for coming down here.

2528
03:36:32.58 --> 03:36:37.58
And thanks for sharing your experiences and all these lessons learned with everybody.

2529
03:36:37.58 --> 03:36:43.58
I mean it's just awesome that people can pick up this book and learn what you've learned over the decades of work you've put into this.

2530
03:36:43.58 --> 03:36:47.58
And of course more important thanks for your service.

2531
03:36:47.58 --> 03:36:50.58
Thanks for your service in law enforcement and the FBI.

2532
03:36:50.58 --> 03:37:00.58
Thanks for fighting terrorists and kidnappers and drug dealers and criminals to keep us safe here on the home front.

2533
03:37:00.58 --> 03:37:02.58
And the same deal brother.

2534
03:37:02.58 --> 03:37:04.58
It was an honor to be able to serve.

2535
03:37:04.58 --> 03:37:05.58
Yeah amen.

2536
03:37:05.58 --> 03:37:06.58
Exactly.

2537
03:37:06.58 --> 03:37:07.58
It was a privilege.

2538
03:37:07.58 --> 03:37:08.58
All right.

2539
03:37:08.58 --> 03:37:10.58
Thank you.

2540
03:37:10.58 --> 03:37:14.58
And with that Chris Voss has left the building.

2541
03:37:14.58 --> 03:37:15.58
Echo Charles.

2542
03:37:15.58 --> 03:37:16.58
Yes sir.

2543
03:37:16.58 --> 03:37:18.58
Excited about that one huh.

2544
03:37:18.58 --> 03:37:19.58
Yes.

2545
03:37:19.58 --> 03:37:20.58
You liked that one.

2546
03:37:20.58 --> 03:37:21.58
I liked that one.

2547
03:37:21.58 --> 03:37:22.58
Lot to learn.

2548
03:37:22.58 --> 03:37:23.58
Yeah.

2549
03:37:23.58 --> 03:37:26.58
What was your big takeaway besides the fact that you're an accommodator.

2550
03:37:26.58 --> 03:37:27.58
I know.

2551
03:37:27.58 --> 03:37:29.58
I felt it right when he was explaining it.

2552
03:37:29.58 --> 03:37:30.58
I was like that's.

2553
03:37:30.58 --> 03:37:32.58
Well he also said they make the most deals.

2554
03:37:32.58 --> 03:37:33.58
There you go.

2555
03:37:33.58 --> 03:37:34.58
Right.

2556
03:37:34.58 --> 03:37:36.58
Establishing rapport all that.

2557
03:37:36.58 --> 03:37:39.58
And I look am I am I an accommodator.

2558
03:37:39.58 --> 03:37:44.58
But if I'm not I know I have accommodator traits from time to time.

2559
03:37:44.58 --> 03:37:46.58
We know that you're not analytic.

2560
03:37:46.58 --> 03:37:47.58
Okay.

2561
03:37:47.58 --> 03:37:49.58
We know that you're not assertive.

2562
03:37:49.58 --> 03:37:51.58
There's only three options.

2563
03:37:51.58 --> 03:37:52.58
Yeah.

2564
03:37:52.58 --> 03:37:53.58
Okay.

2565
03:37:53.58 --> 03:37:54.58
Whoa.

2566
03:37:54.58 --> 03:37:55.58
No no no.

2567
03:37:55.58 --> 03:37:56.58
Blend blend blend.

2568
03:37:56.58 --> 03:37:58.58
But your high percentage accommodator maybe.

2569
03:37:58.58 --> 03:37:59.58
We'll go with that from now on.

2570
03:37:59.58 --> 03:38:02.58
I'm gonna keep an eye on it because I like to know what I don't know.

2571
03:38:02.58 --> 03:38:03.58
So it seems same.

2572
03:38:03.58 --> 03:38:04.58
So it did shed some light.

2573
03:38:04.58 --> 03:38:05.58
That's a good idea.

2574
03:38:05.58 --> 03:38:07.58
On that thing.

2575
03:38:07.58 --> 03:38:10.58
The interesting takeaway.

2576
03:38:10.58 --> 03:38:13.58
Geography is more influential than ethnicity.

2577
03:38:13.58 --> 03:38:19.58
Building and it makes sense because in Hawaii everybody's mixed and you know there's all

2578
03:38:19.58 --> 03:38:20.58
different kind of community.

2579
03:38:20.58 --> 03:38:22.58
But if you're from.

2580
03:38:22.58 --> 03:38:24.58
Waimanalo and I'm from Waimanalo.

2581
03:38:24.58 --> 03:38:25.58
Yeah.

2582
03:38:25.58 --> 03:38:26.58
We're good.

2583
03:38:26.58 --> 03:38:28.58
We can be in Dubai mean your brothers.

2584
03:38:28.58 --> 03:38:29.58
Yeah.

2585
03:38:29.58 --> 03:38:30.58
100%.

2586
03:38:30.58 --> 03:38:31.58
So.

2587
03:38:31.58 --> 03:38:33.58
So that made a lot of sense to me.

2588
03:38:33.58 --> 03:38:38.58
And what did what did did shed some light on is some of your tactics as well.

2589
03:38:38.58 --> 03:38:39.58
Oh.

2590
03:38:39.58 --> 03:38:40.58
In a good way.

2591
03:38:40.58 --> 03:38:41.58
So.

2592
03:38:41.58 --> 03:38:42.58
Um.

2593
03:38:42.58 --> 03:38:43.58
Okay.

2594
03:38:43.58 --> 03:38:46.58
One time you called me out for clicking the pen.

2595
03:38:46.58 --> 03:38:50.58
I edited it out so it's not on the episode but it's.

2596
03:38:50.58 --> 03:38:53.58
And the way you said it was.

2597
03:38:53.58 --> 03:38:57.58
Is that clicking going to show up on the recording.

2598
03:38:57.58 --> 03:38:58.58
Do you think.

2599
03:38:58.58 --> 03:39:02.58
You said you think like me it was like my idea kind of a thing you know.

2600
03:39:02.58 --> 03:39:04.58
Like I have to figure out for myself.

2601
03:39:04.58 --> 03:39:09.98
If it's gonna as opposed to hey that clicking is annoying and it's going to ruin the take

2602
03:39:09.98 --> 03:39:11.58
or whatever you know.

2603
03:39:11.58 --> 03:39:12.58
I was like.

2604
03:39:12.58 --> 03:39:13.58
Oh.

2605
03:39:13.58 --> 03:39:17.58
I see because it was effective and if you look back on the video I think I published

2606
03:39:17.58 --> 03:39:19.58
that outtake somewhere.

2607
03:39:19.58 --> 03:39:20.58
Okay.

2608
03:39:20.58 --> 03:39:21.58
Um.

2609
03:39:21.58 --> 03:39:25.58
If you look on the video I responded like totally like it worked.

2610
03:39:25.58 --> 03:39:26.58
Mm hmm.

2611
03:39:26.58 --> 03:39:27.58
That little tactic.

2612
03:39:27.58 --> 03:39:28.58
I did.

2613
03:39:28.58 --> 03:39:34.58
You know the it really was cool to read the book and to identify all these things that

2614
03:39:34.58 --> 03:39:37.02
they're they're psychological.

2615
03:39:37.02 --> 03:39:42.90
They're psychological traits or psychological characteristics or psychological maneuvers.

2616
03:39:42.90 --> 03:39:46.26
So they work again they work with human beings so it doesn't matter your leadership your

2617
03:39:46.26 --> 03:39:55.38
interrogation your your negotiation they're all they're all going to have some similar

2618
03:39:55.38 --> 03:39:57.10
similar approaches and they are.

2619
03:39:57.10 --> 03:40:01.98
And so yeah it was really cool really cool to read about really cool to go through and

2620
03:40:01.98 --> 03:40:05.74
then be able to sit here with Chris and talk through it.

2621
03:40:05.74 --> 03:40:10.74
And you know it's awesome he and again I kind of did go through I talked about it on the

2622
03:40:10.74 --> 03:40:14.42
podcast but like the book has a bunch of cool stories in it right.

2623
03:40:14.42 --> 03:40:19.30
And is there a temptation just to jump into like negotiation hostage negotiation all that

2624
03:40:19.30 --> 03:40:20.70
stuff.

2625
03:40:20.70 --> 03:40:26.58
But I felt like I was like really kind of want to dive into the tactics the principles themselves.

2626
03:40:26.58 --> 03:40:29.98
So maybe I was a little bit selfish on that one.

2627
03:40:29.98 --> 03:40:37.10
But yeah you know what I realized about you what I might have told you this before where

2628
03:40:37.10 --> 03:40:43.42
your your interest is like it's like an 80 20 where you like how things work for sure

2629
03:40:43.42 --> 03:40:48.90
but only like 20 percent 80 percent is you're interested in OK so what do we do about it.

2630
03:40:48.90 --> 03:40:54.66
So like and I think I'm kind of the if I'm like really trying to be introspective I'm

2631
03:40:54.66 --> 03:40:58.02
kind of the opposite so I'm like a 20 80 kind of a scenario.

2632
03:40:58.02 --> 03:41:02.82
So anytime I start going deep on how things work I see your eyes kind of glaze over and

2633
03:41:02.82 --> 03:41:05.46
then you snap to and you be like OK this is what you do this is what you do.

2634
03:41:05.46 --> 03:41:10.18
It's like you you interrupt it with the next step kind of a thing.

2635
03:41:10.18 --> 03:41:14.18
So so I can see why you'd be really into the the stories.

2636
03:41:14.18 --> 03:41:18.98
But yeah I think the tactics are the ones that a lot of the time anyway if you listen to them

2637
03:41:18.98 --> 03:41:22.46
it's like OK now I can use them in my particular life.

2638
03:41:22.46 --> 03:41:24.82
I think they're both together are the most effective for sure.

2639
03:41:24.82 --> 03:41:28.94
Yeah the other thing that I thought about look I don't care how long a podcast is going

2640
03:41:28.94 --> 03:41:29.94
to be.

2641
03:41:29.94 --> 03:41:35.46
I don't care for 12 hours but I also you know you have to think all right if we start getting

2642
03:41:35.46 --> 03:41:41.74
into all these cool stories he's gotten here they all have their own branches and you know

2643
03:41:41.74 --> 03:41:47.26
sub stories and details that's going to be you know we get to a point where diminishing

2644
03:41:47.26 --> 03:41:48.26
returns right.

2645
03:41:48.26 --> 03:41:53.90
You just have a 19 hour podcast in which point just get on just just go and read the book

2646
03:41:53.90 --> 03:41:57.74
yourself or go get the audio book and go with it that way.

2647
03:41:57.74 --> 03:42:00.38
So that's kind of the kind of how I went with it.

2648
03:42:00.38 --> 03:42:07.54
But just just awesome to have him on here and and learn from you know the subtitle

2649
03:42:07.54 --> 03:42:10.10
book is negotiating as if your life depends on it.

2650
03:42:10.10 --> 03:42:11.22
Depended on it right.

2651
03:42:11.22 --> 03:42:17.46
So he is countless times negotiated stuff that is where someone's life or lives were

2652
03:42:17.46 --> 03:42:19.50
on the line.

2653
03:42:19.50 --> 03:42:24.02
Doesn't get more you know I used to say about extreme ownership combat is like life but

2654
03:42:24.02 --> 03:42:26.82
amplified and intensified.

2655
03:42:26.82 --> 03:42:33.62
Well if you can negotiate for someone's life you can negotiate for the car that you want

2656
03:42:33.62 --> 03:42:37.98
the used car that you want to pay you know twenty seven hundred bucks for instead of

2657
03:42:37.98 --> 03:42:40.94
the forty two hundred bucks that they're offering it.

2658
03:42:40.94 --> 03:42:43.26
So there you go.

2659
03:42:43.26 --> 03:42:44.46
Thanks for joining us everybody.

2660
03:42:44.46 --> 03:42:49.34
If you want to if you like this podcast and you want to support it and you want to actually

2661
03:42:49.34 --> 03:42:54.82
support yourself cognitively you want to be cognitively ready for those moments.

2662
03:42:54.82 --> 03:43:01.26
That's why I'm three deep right now with jockel fuel with discipline goes now normally you'd

2663
03:43:01.26 --> 03:43:05.94
be thinking oh you drank three energy drinks today.

2664
03:43:05.94 --> 03:43:07.42
You've had a bad day.

2665
03:43:07.42 --> 03:43:11.58
You have to you have to mark this down as a negative on your overall health.

2666
03:43:11.58 --> 03:43:13.02
We're actually not doing that at all.

2667
03:43:13.02 --> 03:43:17.02
We're not even doing that at all because I had one what times it's four o'clock right

2668
03:43:17.02 --> 03:43:18.02
now.

2669
03:43:18.02 --> 03:43:26.38
I had the first one at like 1030 prior to a echelon front Academy call then I had another

2670
03:43:26.38 --> 03:43:30.58
one as we kind of started this thing and then I had another one as we kind of got halfway

2671
03:43:30.58 --> 03:43:32.18
through this thing.

2672
03:43:32.18 --> 03:43:34.86
So what does that mean I've had does that mean I've had a bunch of sugar.

2673
03:43:34.86 --> 03:43:36.50
I mean I've had 82 grand.

2674
03:43:36.50 --> 03:43:37.90
No I've had zero sugar.

2675
03:43:37.90 --> 03:43:41.54
I've had some monk fruit which is a beautiful thing.

2676
03:43:41.54 --> 03:43:47.50
I've had have I had what would that be three times have I had 600 milligrams of caffeine.

2677
03:43:47.50 --> 03:43:52.18
No I haven't even had 300 milligrams caffeine.

2678
03:43:52.18 --> 03:43:53.18
So we're good.

2679
03:43:53.18 --> 03:43:55.54
Over here plus I got some vitamin B6.

2680
03:43:55.54 --> 03:43:58.06
Well you know I'm good.

2681
03:43:58.06 --> 03:43:59.30
No doing good.

2682
03:43:59.30 --> 03:44:03.42
So if you want to be good too but you want that energy.

Go to jocofuel.com get yourself some milk which is dessert get yourself some go.

03:44:11.82 --> 03:44:14.78
You can also go to Wawa.

You can you jocofuel.com you can check it.

2687
03:44:25.66 --> 03:44:28.70
We're getting there but the ready to drink stuff is kind of a game changer.

2688
03:44:28.70 --> 03:44:31.02
Yeah it's good.

2689
03:44:31.02 --> 03:44:34.54
I told you about the chocolate milk versus milk right.

2690
03:44:34.54 --> 03:44:39.66
With my daughter who is not going to pull any punches.

2691
03:44:39.66 --> 03:44:44.70
She looked Pete we know we sat down at day bullet camp and Pete was all like oh it's

2692
03:44:44.70 --> 03:44:50.86
better than chocolate milk and she looked at him like he was a liar.

2693
03:44:50.86 --> 03:44:54.46
I was like get her to settle down you know.

2694
03:44:54.46 --> 03:44:58.70
You can't look at a you know a grown man like he's a liar but she kind of looked at him

2695
03:44:58.70 --> 03:45:04.86
like yeah right but the good thing is Pete was like oh let's go yeah let's go get him

2696
03:45:04.86 --> 03:45:05.86
out.

2697
03:45:05.86 --> 03:45:13.70
So we got out the straight regular like chocolate milk and milk side by side taste test well

2698
03:45:13.70 --> 03:45:22.02
blind taste test she she was like dang that's the that's the true that's probably the truest

2699
03:45:22.02 --> 03:45:27.06
and most awesome test that's ever been performed for taste in the world in the world probably

2700
03:45:27.06 --> 03:45:28.06
right.

2701
03:45:28.06 --> 03:45:32.14
There you go get yourself some more get yourself some ready to drink more vitamin shops got

2702
03:45:32.14 --> 03:45:34.78
this stuff as well go in there.

2703
03:45:34.78 --> 03:45:38.78
Thing is hey I remember about Wawa somebody hit me up on social media they cleared the

2704
03:45:38.78 --> 03:45:41.26
shelves in Wawa.

2705
03:45:41.26 --> 03:45:45.46
Thank you because look it's a war out there.

2706
03:45:45.46 --> 03:45:47.74
Have I explained the war to you a little bit.

2707
03:45:47.74 --> 03:45:48.74
It's a war.

2708
03:45:48.74 --> 03:45:51.74
The big companies don't like the little companies.

2709
03:45:51.74 --> 03:45:58.86
The big companies have overwhelming firepower in the term in the form of cash money that

2710
03:45:58.86 --> 03:46:04.90
they can throw to try and crush the the the up and comers.

2711
03:46:04.90 --> 03:46:06.86
They don't want that competition.

2712
03:46:06.86 --> 03:46:08.10
They want to smash.

2713
03:46:08.10 --> 03:46:09.58
They want to smash jocco fuel.

2714
03:46:09.58 --> 03:46:13.30
They want to smash discipline go.

2715
03:46:13.30 --> 03:46:21.42
So what they do is they make maneuvers they throw money at at stores and the stores like

2716
03:46:21.42 --> 03:46:25.06
to offer something else but they got to be able to got to make sense.

2717
03:46:25.06 --> 03:46:28.74
So when you go and you clear the shelves at Wawa thank you when you go any of these any

2718
03:46:28.74 --> 03:46:32.18
of these stores when you go in there and get after it it shows them that there's demand

2719
03:46:32.18 --> 03:46:37.74
signal to retail and they want to keep us as opposed to when somebody throws a bunch

2720
03:46:37.74 --> 03:46:43.30
of money and say we want you to we want you to get rid of those guys.

2721
03:46:43.30 --> 03:46:44.62
Think about that.

2722
03:46:44.62 --> 03:46:46.30
That's called a monopoly.

2723
03:46:46.30 --> 03:46:47.30
Yeah.

2724
03:46:47.30 --> 03:46:48.30
Right.

2725
03:46:48.30 --> 03:46:49.30
Those are monopoly moves.

2726
03:46:49.30 --> 03:46:51.54
Yeah.

2727
03:46:51.54 --> 03:46:54.90
And so we appreciate it when you help us fight the man.

2728
03:46:54.90 --> 03:46:55.90
Yeah.

2729
03:46:55.90 --> 03:46:56.90
Right.

2730
03:46:56.90 --> 03:46:58.90
The corporate entity.

2731
03:46:58.90 --> 03:46:59.90
That's not a person.

2732
03:46:59.90 --> 03:47:00.90
There's no person.

2733
03:47:00.90 --> 03:47:02.46

03:47:02.46 --> 03:47:03.46

They're not people.

2736
03:47:04.46 --> 03:47:05.90
They're just big corporate entities.

2737
03:47:05.90 --> 03:47:08.90
There's big giant corporate entities.

2738
03:47:08.90 --> 03:47:10.10

No humans.

2740
03:47:11.10 --> 03:47:12.10
Yes.

2741
03:47:12.10 --> 03:47:13.10
We're human.

2742
03:47:13.10 --> 03:47:14.10

03:49:15.22 --> 03:49:16.22
That has layers in it.

2809
03:49:16.22 --> 03:49:17.22
Layers.

2810
03:49:17.22 --> 03:49:18.22
Could be one layer.

2811
03:49:18.22 --> 03:49:19.22
Could be seven layers.

2812
03:49:19.22 --> 03:49:20.22
You get seven layers.

2813
03:49:20.22 --> 03:49:21.22
Do we charge by the layer?

2814
03:49:21.22 --> 03:49:22.22
No.

2815
03:49:22.22 --> 03:49:23.22
No.

2816
03:49:23.22 --> 03:49:24.22
The layers is just part of the package.

2817
03:49:24.22 --> 03:49:25.22
Included.

2818
03:49:25.22 --> 03:49:26.22
You're right.

2819
03:49:26.22 --> 03:49:27.22
But yes.

2820
03:49:27.22 --> 03:49:28.22
Good.

2821
03:49:28.22 --> 03:49:29.22
Cool designs.

2822
03:49:29.22 --> 03:49:30.22
People like really like the designs.

2823
03:49:30.22 --> 03:49:31.22
This is what I'm finding out and thank it.

2824
03:49:31.22 --> 03:49:32.22
Thanks for everyone for the feedback.

2825
03:49:32.22 --> 03:49:33.22
So yeah.

2826

Really good shirt locker.

2827

Just stuff.

2832
03:49:39.22 --> 03:49:40.22
Just stuff across the board.

2833
03:49:40.22 --> 03:49:41.22
Subscribe to the podcast.

2834
03:49:41.22 --> 03:49:42.22
You know that.

2835
03:49:42.22 --> 03:49:44.22
So we've been recording those.

2836
03:49:44.22 --> 03:49:47.22
Putting word out answering your questions.

2837
03:49:47.22 --> 03:49:51.72
If you go to jockeauunderground.com, the people are getting censored right now.

2838
03:49:51.72 --> 03:49:52.72
People are getting banned.

2839
03:49:52.72 --> 03:49:53.72
Whatever.

2840
03:49:53.72 --> 03:49:54.72
We're not going to.

2841
03:49:54.72 --> 03:49:56.74
That's not going to happen to us at least on the platform that we could happen on this

2842
03:49:56.74 --> 03:49:58.94
platform, whatever platform you're listening to.

2843
03:49:58.94 --> 03:50:01.38
They could ban us.

2844
03:50:01.38 --> 03:50:03.74
If that happens, we'll be on jockeauunderground.com.

2845
03:50:03.74 --> 03:50:06.26
It costs $8.18 a month.

2846
03:50:06.26 --> 03:50:08.62
If you can't afford it, no big deal.

2847
03:50:08.62 --> 03:50:09.62
We still are.

2848
03:50:09.62 --> 03:50:10.62
We're still here to support.

2849
03:50:10.62 --> 03:50:13.62
We know hard times right now, right?

2850
03:50:13.62 --> 03:50:17.02
If you can't afford it, email assistance at jockeauunderground.com.

2851
03:50:17.02 --> 03:50:18.42
If you can't afford it, cool.

2852
03:50:18.42 --> 03:50:20.22
Support the cause.

2853
03:50:20.22 --> 03:50:22.02
Capital T-H-E.

2854
03:50:22.02 --> 03:50:25.02
The capital C-A-U-S-E.

2855
03:50:25.02 --> 03:50:27.02
The cause.

2856
03:50:27.02 --> 03:50:29.02
Freedom.

2857
03:50:29.02 --> 03:50:30.02
Psychological warfare.

2858
03:50:30.02 --> 03:50:31.78
We've got flipsidecanvas.com.

2859
03:50:31.78 --> 03:50:34.58
Books obviously never split the difference.

2860
03:50:34.58 --> 03:50:37.22
By Chris Voss, check that book out and then all the books out.

2861
03:50:37.22 --> 03:50:41.74
Get that book, Only Cry for the Living by Holly McKay.

2862
03:50:41.74 --> 03:50:42.74
Just a great book.

2863
03:50:42.74 --> 03:50:44.58
We put it out on jockeaupublishing.

2864
03:50:44.58 --> 03:50:46.30
Check that one out and then all the books I've written.

2865
03:50:46.30 --> 03:50:49.02
You know what they are.

2866
03:50:49.02 --> 03:50:50.02
So go get them.

2867
03:50:50.02 --> 03:50:51.38
Get the Warrior Kid books.

2868
03:50:51.38 --> 03:50:55.18
Let's face it, that book would have helped you set out so much if you had it when you

2869
03:50:55.18 --> 03:50:56.18
were a kid.

2870
03:50:56.18 --> 03:50:57.18
It would have helped me.

2871
03:50:57.18 --> 03:50:59.22
And if you know kids, any kids, get them that book.

2872
03:50:59.22 --> 03:51:01.82
Once again, Christmas, cool.

2873
03:51:01.82 --> 03:51:02.82
Get it.

2874
03:51:02.82 --> 03:51:03.82
Make it happen.

2875
03:51:03.82 --> 03:51:07.58
And then we'll go to the front.

2876
03:51:07.58 --> 03:51:09.78
You heard me talking a lot about leadership today.

2877
03:51:09.78 --> 03:51:14.30
Well, we solve problems through leadership at Ashland Front.

2878
03:51:14.30 --> 03:51:16.54
Go to ashlandfront.com.

2879
03:51:16.54 --> 03:51:26.94
And also up and coming, we've got a little something that we call the roll call, which

2880
03:51:26.94 --> 03:51:30.34
roll call is an event.

2881
03:51:30.34 --> 03:51:31.34
And we've got one.

2882
03:51:31.34 --> 03:51:34.70
Had to just check this because they told me they still got some seats.

2883
03:51:34.70 --> 03:51:35.70
Our stuff sells out quick.

2884
03:51:35.70 --> 03:51:44.10
So roll call is for police law enforcement, first responders, military, October 17th,

2885
03:51:44.10 --> 03:51:45.58

2886
03:51:45.58 --> 03:51:49.82
If you're in that category, go and check that out.

2887
03:51:49.82 --> 03:51:56.02
It's going to be, it's our leadership principles kind of geared toward that group of people.

2888
03:51:56.02 --> 03:51:58.82
Also we have online training.

2889
03:51:58.82 --> 03:51:59.82
Said this today.

2890
03:51:59.82 --> 03:52:07.82
We're going to get good at leadership with one book or with one rehearsal or one practice.

2891
03:52:07.82 --> 03:52:10.10
No, you need to get in there.

2892

Also check out Mike Affinck.

He's got his program taking you up and taking vets up in the wilderness so they can find

2902
03:52:41.26 --> 03:52:48.86
themselves again and rebuild heroesandhorses.org.

I'm at Jocko Willink.

2912
03:53:21.10 --> 03:53:25.58
Of course, watch out because that algorithm is sitting there waiting to grab you by the

2913
03:53:25.58 --> 03:53:28.62
throat and drag you into oblivion.

2914
03:53:28.62 --> 03:53:30.02
Don't let it.

2915
03:53:30.02 --> 03:53:34.14
Thanks once again to Chris Voss for joining us, for teaching us about negotiation.

2916
03:53:34.14 --> 03:53:40.78
And thanks to Chris for his service in the police department and the FBI.

2917
03:53:40.78 --> 03:53:46.26
Thanks to all the FBI agents that are out there right now doing their best to keep us

2918
03:53:46.26 --> 03:53:47.26
safe.

2919
03:53:47.26 --> 03:53:52.18
And the same goes to the rest of our police and law enforcement firefighters, paramedics,

2920
03:53:52.18 --> 03:53:57.42
DMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, border patrol, secret service, all first responders.

2921
03:53:57.42 --> 03:54:00.10
Thanks for everything that you all do to keep us safe.

2922
03:54:00.10 --> 03:54:04.14
And of course, thanks to our military men and women who are on the front lines around

2923
03:54:04.14 --> 03:54:07.30
the world right now.

2924
03:54:07.30 --> 03:54:12.02
We live in freedom because of the sacrifices you make.

2925
03:54:12.02 --> 03:54:14.42
Thank you for your service.

2926
03:54:14.42 --> 03:54:20.22
And everyone else out there, life is a negotiation.

2927
03:54:20.22 --> 03:54:23.06
And people are not rational.

2928
03:54:23.06 --> 03:54:26.66
They are filled with emotions and biases and judgments.

2929
03:54:26.66 --> 03:54:32.34
And that includes you.

2930
03:54:32.34 --> 03:54:40.26
So pay attention and listen more than you talk, not just in negotiation, but in leadership

2931
03:54:40.26 --> 03:54:41.70
and life.

2932
03:54:41.70 --> 03:54:51.38
And until next time, this is Echo and Jocko.
