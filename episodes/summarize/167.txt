and this is what we are doing he's already got gigs booked which is awesome echelon front dot com if you need help with leadership in your organization we will help you that's what we do we have the master in 2019 23 24 May and Chicago 1920 September in Denver 4 and 5 December in Sydney Australia every event we've done has sold out go to extremownership.com if you want to come otherwise it's gonna be sold out and you won't be able to come and you'll be all mad and you'll be mad at me and then someone said that it's like when I went to Lala Palusa and I went and saw Rollins who I kind of knew and I was like hey man can you get us in and Rollins said it be easier to sneak you into Fort Knox and I kind of like was all hard to call or like he kind of forgot what it's like in the streets but it was an up to him exactly now now I'm the guy now I'm the guy that's going to be saying hey be easier to sneak you into Fort Knox I gave you a heads up your big time now so we're gonna check that's that EF online online interactive training from echelon front we needed to speak to more people and we don't have enough instructors can run enough monsters each year and it was a good contrast for them to see because it made it so obvious like why you have to work together why these relationships we have inside the tasking you're so important why we need if you have an issue you're bringing it up you're bringing it to me why it's not going to freak me out why we're going to talk about it why you know life always says and stoner would it tell you the same thing if life thought like hey I'd like to try this a different way I'd be like cool how do you want to try it go let's let's make it happen I don't care I don't I don't care what happens as long as it makes us win so there was a really cool for me unfortunately it was not cool for you to be in a position where I could look and use the leadership failures in that task unit and the other interesting thing was like you talk about those two guys you're yeah having no idea what's gonna happen is the worst I I talk about that example of rats and a cage and how the rats on one side of the cage they just get electrocuted randomly from the floor and but the electrocution isn't very strong the other side of the cage has a stronger electrocution shock but there's a little light that comes on that lets them know that you're about to get shocked and rats prefer to know that they're gonna get shocked even if it's more often and even if it's stronger they just prefer to know that it's common as opposed to be just randomly getting shocked and you know why it's gonna happen and that's basically where you where your task unit was because there was I mean it was like a public too it was like a public everyone kind of knew it was going on at least after about six months you know I would say after all of us being at the team for about six months it was readily apparent that's for sure and you guys actually the one of the pieces of collateral damage that was Mike's are Ellie and Mike's are Ellie he they didn't know what to do with them because I forget what the internal conflict Yeah that's a good point though when you say where does it go down to so three I would say there my son is like two he was like just before two and a half and I'd read him more reading it to my daughter he's there but he'll catch certain things you know when there's like monsters ready to bite he'll be you know like he'll know certain stuff so as you kind of get older you absorb more and more and so that's kind of what happened there the boss the new boss comes in and says hey here's what's going on here's what we're gonna do hey you guy that's all jacked up here's what you need to improve and everyone instead of what in your mind you might think hey I'm gonna piss everyone off if I come in and lay down the law at this you gotta remember that people have been wondering what the hell is going on for six months for a year they don't know who's in charge everything's a disaster no decisions are gonna be you come in and people go thank god thank you for telling me what the hell you want I'm tired of playing a guessing game every Monday morning about who's my boss and what direction we're going into so that's that's an important part remember now I am definitely there's a dichotomy of course because you can come in and you can start barking orders and everyone just says who are you where you come from you don't know what you're talking about you haven't been here shut up and of course they won't say that to you they'll just undermine what you're trying to do and calls all kinds of you know just just trying you serve you with whatever they can so that's probably but what I'm saying is there is a a happy medium and there are times when you lean towards being laying down the wall there's times where you lean towards being more loose and you gotta figure out where that's gonna be depending on the situation you're diving into and and so if if anything you do is like fashion which I mean there's some fashion stuff in your past like maybe hair styles etc that's why if you see old pictures of jacco with his hair you feel like you know that's kind of the thing that's the that's the guy that Jason was talking about earlier that's me like we like that And I'm just, you know, everything's a joke or whatever and get out of the vehicle and, you know, some guys yelling at us with the fake Russian accent and I'm just laughing at it inside and which means, you know, I'm like kind of, I got that I was 19 and the dude, the dude comes over and he like yells at me and I, you know, who knows what I said to prove that I was a tough guy and this dude correct me and I was like, but a huge cost so there's like this too little additional elements to a successful spas escape or whatever one you gotta be at least somewhat strong like you can like a smaller person like spasking is less effective even at high level there's that and then when you're strong when you're strong person and you spas successfully you're way more tired way more tired so you get a person where you put them in a spashing state like two three three times in a row and they make that emotional decision when in fact the teams can take care of you too you know the teams can go hey look we know you need some downtime you're gonna go to buds and be an instructor or whatever you know for three years you know you can get your kid through high school or whatever so the teams has a good job usually of taking care of of the people you know taking care of team guys but sometimes you know people they have the grassest screener situation and again in the 90s we're planning we're training for a big game that we're not going to do So a guy get pushed off a roof, we were watching, and in the evening we had gotten someone said, hey, this one building about two kilometers away, that's one of the clan leaders buildings, and we could see guys up there in the evening, and they get that caught there, that makes them all go kind of crazy, and we'd see guys sitting there like watching the sunset up on a roof, and then one of them when start to get animated, the waving their arms around, like there are going about something, then they were all animated, then they were up like beating each other with clubs, hitting each other with rocks, and then it would just stop, and then it would start up again, and I think at least one of those, we watched the guy just get pushed off a roof, fall dead, when that is just how they were all. so I feature like like famous Gigi to people or when you know like Jeff Glover, Keen and Kreni like these guys premise is we're just living our life but and you know what I'm the great part that you just mentioned is like a three hour conversation yeah which we don't aren't gonna have right now because look the second part of your career or the part that if yeah we'll get into this we'll do another one we'll just we'll just roll do another podcast we'll record it like tomorrow and that's gonna follow you into Afghanistan back to Iraq again more time more training more tours combat tours tours as senior listed tours as the command master chief tours as an ops master chief I mean there's a lot of massive stuff to talk about from here on out so we'll do that we'll record and you know I know in a way too where that's why these little smaller guys when they're super advanced I don't think they have for spas ever because it's always like it's been unproductive for them right every attempted spas is gonna be like unsuccessful you know Because, because now I look back, how awesome it must be when you got like guys like that at the team who were just like, oh, yeah, So was your dad was your dad kind of like the stereotypical marine that was just like, oh, like acting like a drill started charging. Then this camp that was 500 yards south of us, we saw a group of like seven guys, two of them had RPGs, you rocket propellant grenades, another guys patrolling with like two peak two pkm gunners, they're built finishing guns and like an AK gunner and they're patrolling and we can see him, we can see him and now they come out the front of the camp and at the gate of that camp which is facing us 500 yards away, there's two sandbagged positions for the watches who would be up there to check people coming in and out. And then a guy that straight across for me, I can remember seeing a big black hand come over his shoulder and it like covers up half of his chest, like like Andre the giant big and just moved the dude away and then another guy, a hand moves the other guy away and I think about just having a guy like Monty who's like level headed who's been in some shit before and can go you know what hey we need to shoot this guy before he shoots it us that's just totally sensible thing to say but if if everyone's because you got these massive oh RLE briefs and everyone's being paranoid They're only allowed to like hit you from out here to here, but it was like, you know, those those images in Rocky where it was like, oh, stars and that just, oh, that was that little smirk I just had on my face laying on the ground over there. and when I went to college for three years and when I came back I was like right the main thing I learned in college was never ever ever ever get out of the teams ever because it dealing with other people it was just so horrible and especially I mean like you and me who literally spent our whole adult life in a puttune you get out of in a normal people and you're like what are you everyone doing once I have what why is this even happening it just nothing makes sense like hey they're both guys I actually know both those guys and would be getting debrief to buy both of them like both of them would be telling me what the other person was doing and man you just be thinking guys instead of telling me go tell each other go talk to each other it didn't happen I was super stoked and super jealous of course like every other guy was like which actually this is why I did another arc because it seemed like hey if you're going to get some action you need to go with the Marine Corps in the arc and go out and do that. but man when you when you don't have that everyone's all excited everyone's freaking out and everything's just magnified and so it's pretty impressive and to me you know again you have a guy like Monty that's just looking at the OIC it's boss and saying hey we actually need to kill this guy right now and and not being like we need to take this guy out which just escalated then the OIC is thinking yeah we're like what's it pops with them when it got to go out and some ops with them got to go on a lot of date like my favorite thing to do was go out on daytime presence patrols with the army or the Marine Corps because that's was so fun you know but um you know that's uh the land it was under land warfare and the land warfare all I see at the time was uh worn off so pressure dug pressure to do some awesome dude he still works in shooting to this day and uh we got a lot of cool stuff done like we got the the ballistic computers which made you know shooting a whole lot more predictable just hey you're good load another round just being calm when I think about the advantage and how that's a pretty good performance you know what you guys who's a pretty good performance with no experience because I think of how you know what what I gain through experience and the maturity the combat maturity of seeing things and things unfolding being like yeah there's an organization that does a lot of just like work for like honestly cancer kids and stuff like that it's a situation that unfolds that you know is going to unfold that you know is not the correct thing to do and there's no way you can stop yourself from doing it like you just said you someone's gonna arm lock you you know what's gonna happen you could just go yeah deans thumbs up he's like training he's like the ex boyfriend of his data whatever so so Vader like chops his head off uh-huh hey man you got your lawn you're one like one degree separation from getting all the new stuff to where you're at really because it feels like 180 you know I'm over here looking on mine it's stuff anyway also mok right mornin jacen we talked earlier you just want that's not going on a style no sure it's not so there we go origin jeans we are in production with origin jeans in production at this time so check the website originmain.com if you want to get some jeans or if your name is not jacca will link you can get pair of joggers the joggers are good that's the thing where I got I wasn't down for the joggers Pete told me this he opened my open my little like a mind or whatever I put him on I was like dang these are comfortable but man they're skinny they're thin but I think it's the the the 501st Vader's fist I've never that's pretty cool actually going to the one the one I have is like I don't know if it's a licensed costume or what but there aren't any you just it has to be so good that they're like they'll validate it because there's no such thing as a licensed costume for any for Stormtrooper you just make the stuff And all you do is, you know, the guy that's all straight-laced, running around the team, looking like a dork and you just think, when you're a young team guy, you're like, this guy's a dork, he doesn't eat. yeah like later like because you know I would you know when I was well Like he was a, oh, guys, because if you were good at your job, that's like the base level of having respect and getting people listen to you is, oh, this guy is a really good at his job. I mean I had to get everybody at the side of the pool at the five star hotel and I'm like listen I want to be there too it's not gonna happen we have to put the mission first our mission is to be here and this is an amazing experience I guarantee you're gonna remember for the rest of your life you guys you got to stop planning yeah stop worrying about it and of course all the guys always joke about the fact that when you're sitting in a sweaty Overwatch position it's a hundred and eighteen degrees I'm like, in the ocean, you're like, like the sharks are just waiting right there for you to come in and just come up and bite you. they're so they're skinny ghi sweatpants kind of tapered not kind of they're really tapered little bit of what he call like a drop crotch a little bit from like a lot of roomy in the hip area kind of think you think they're functional I mean obviously it happens less and less but there'll be like momentary spas situations even at like the top level where you kind of got to stay calm I mean everyone's gonna all run into it where I got to stay conscious of it so if you want to know what we teach you want to get granular with it check out EF online.com and finally we have the EF Overwatch which is where we take guys that came from special operations and combat aviation they have massive amounts of experience leadership experience they understand the principles we talk about we write about that we teach they understand those and they will bring them into your company you can hire them to work and help your organization win EF Overwatch.com is where you can make that happen and if you want to keep this conversation going which is a pretty varied conversation where we're talking about Star Wars, sniper operations and joggers and D&D I mean that's pretty good spectrum you know you might be that D&D old school D&D player with your multi-sided dice getting after it and if you want to talk to us about that we are on the interwebs we're on Twitter we are on Instagram we are on the FISH but echelon was at echelon Charles yeah I was it was interesting to like going back to the work up it was a good contrast for my especially for my officers to kind of see like I'd be watching this unfold I'm just a little warrior kid over here trying to turn around to try to get on the path you know that's the way it is and warrior kid soap you can get that Irish Oach Irish Oach Ranch dot com speaking of warrior kids aid is making soap on his form and he wants you to stay clean what did my what do my kids said today like comment and subscribe I was like You know, I feel like I'm going to Castle Dracula and like, oh, what are they going to do to me? yeah that was crazy that was a horrible like that had been brewing for a long time and so just that drama is so horrible to deal with like the when and they're they're both good guys but I really like their music and I like their message because some of the other stuff like okay rage against some scene for instance. and I was doing my manning the hard-fast rule was if you went to pay calm last time you are not going to pay calm again and then so those guys could get a chance and then some of the some of the guys that went to SENT calm went back but in the end when I'm building seal leaders I need guys that have been everywhere I need guys that have had the pay calm experience and understand their mature enough to go all the mission is first and then guys that have been exposed to combat so they know what that's all about it's like what am I supposed to like relax I'm like I'm I'm just supposed to lose only right now 49 49 And it's just like you said, like you talked about in Panama, those guys, and how the guys made theoretical changes, which is, hey, when the shooting starts, you're going to crawl. he's strict but that I don't care if you if you tell me where my left and rights are especially you know and that guy especially because when you're coming and I've said this many times when you're coming into a situation where there's there's problems right because there's definitely problems when the o-i-c and the task unit commander just got fired there are problems you have to come in and kind of set down you have to lay down the wall a little bit it's not like Yeah, I explored around with like a lot of different music and it just wasn't enough you know it's like Monkeys giving me, gives me another round, he's like, hey, I think they're about at 700 yards now, I'll just your dope, so I'd not made my adjustment from where I was just shooting at to 700, and as, you know, as the, they're doing a peel, a guy gets up and runs, so there was a guy running full value, he's running across with the rock RPG, so I shot at him, hit way behind him, and he went behind the building, then reloaded two more guys peeled behind the building, and then they were just gone. and that's a good lesson for everyone man detached stay calm look what's going on and it all does go back to the fact that you were in that position probably had something to do with the fact that you that you know you were running from air or you know money as a poaching for running from air and building relationships and hanging out with Marines and teaching them whatever and getting giving them some gear and what you know just doing those things that your building relationships with the rest of the team is that it being an arrogant jerk to everyone because you think you're better than them absolutely because there was another unit that had 50 cal sniper rifles that didn't get to come well there you go like hey because guys will say well I can't get promoted if I haven't been to you know what I mean like all these things So um, the Senate LAV over to our position, me and the OIC got in it, and we went and saw the Lieutenant Colonel, and he's like, hey, here, we, we study to map, he's like, hey, here's where the guy is. the ones like you just were like a lot they were like and I never I didn't know you know he's just like another guy East Coast guy that I didn't know And so there's the bullwit crap, so those rounds going over the top of us, and Monty's like, hey, I think this guy's right right at 500 yards, you got your dialed in, you know, he's just talking to my ear. yeah they're like you know he's like jacco And the guys in the teams that did do missions, they were generally like like a couple of got there's a couple of tunes that got, there's a couple of tunes. yeah it's for now thanks for thanks for Ian here and Jason will continue this conversation you know next podcast anything else any closing comments I'm really excited to be on the podcast I just want to tell my wife Iris that she's amazing and made my life so much better by meatner my oldest son Chase South proud Ianim of them and Storm and Thor love you guys also looking forward to seeing you soon awesome and of course we actually could not do this podcast or even live the lives that we live if it wasn't for our people in uniform around the world here at home our military personnel police and law enforcement firefighters paramedics and EMTs correctional officers border patrol all first responders out there thank you for what you do every day so that we can do what we do every day and to everyone else that's listening until that next podcast remember that advice that Rothgar gave bail-off that you should choose the eternal rewards not the short term ones and keep it always in the back of your mind that you're piercing eye will dim and darken and death will arrive to sweep you away so until then keep getting out there into the world and getting after it and until next time this is Jason Gardner and echo and jocco out and then I'm in the circle of these instructors and they're like, he's got the mark of the devil and they're kind of shoving me back and forth and I'm like, oh, okay, this is kind of fun. I felt like that same thing was going on that there'd be like, guys with, you'd get there and within a week, people be on a load your stuff up. so I'm like oh these are good and they're like super comfortable too because you know the cotton and thie is or whatever
