00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.16
This is Jockel Podcast number 54.

2
00:00:06.16 --> 00:00:10.32
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:10.32 --> 00:00:11.72
Good evening, I go.

4
00:00:11.72 --> 00:00:15.40
Good evening.

5
00:00:15.40 --> 00:00:20.28
uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.

6
00:00:20.28 --> 00:00:24.48
You got some Shakespeare right there.

7
00:00:24.48 --> 00:00:28.88
You got some Henry IV part two.

8
00:00:28.88 --> 00:00:41.60
And that play is a play that came just prior to Henry V, the hero, the warrior, the leader

9
00:00:41.60 --> 00:00:47.76
of that few, that happy few, that band of brothers.

10
00:00:47.76 --> 00:00:58.84
Well, his dad, Henry IV, was having a rough time in the kingdom facing rebellion.

11
00:00:58.84 --> 00:01:06.96
And there's a point in the play where he, the old man, Henry IV, he can't sleep.

12
00:01:06.96 --> 00:01:12.56
Can't sleep because the pressure, the pressure and the weight of being a leader.

13
00:01:12.56 --> 00:01:18.16
And it's a great, it's a great chunk of the play.

14
00:01:18.16 --> 00:01:20.000
And it starts with that line.

15
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.28
On easy lies the head that wears a crown.

16
00:01:23.28 --> 00:01:28.48
And it actually doesn't start with that line, that's the last line.

17
00:01:28.48 --> 00:01:30.12
It starts off a little different.

18
00:01:30.12 --> 00:01:32.96
It starts off here.

19
00:01:32.96 --> 00:01:41.88
How many thousand of my poorest subjects are at this hour asleep?

20
00:01:41.88 --> 00:01:45.40
So he's saying, hey, out there, you know, there's thousands and thousands of my subjects.

21
00:01:45.40 --> 00:01:51.84
They're out there asleep in right now.

22
00:01:51.84 --> 00:02:00.76
So sleep, oh, gentle sleep, nature's soft nurse, how have I frightened me?

23
00:02:00.76 --> 00:02:10.28
That thou will, that thou no more will weigh my eyelids down and steep my senses in

24
00:02:10.28 --> 00:02:12.56
forgetfulness.

25
00:02:12.56 --> 00:02:14.12
So he's talking to sleep.

26
00:02:14.12 --> 00:02:16.92
Sleep is like a, like a god to him at this point.

27
00:02:16.92 --> 00:02:18.92
And he said, what did I do to scare you off?

28
00:02:18.92 --> 00:02:22.84
What do I do? What can you bring me that goodness?

29
00:02:22.84 --> 00:02:26.40
Wait down my eyes.

30
00:02:26.40 --> 00:02:30.36
Going back, why rather sleep?

31
00:02:30.36 --> 00:02:38.60
Myest thou in smoky cribs upon uneasy pallets stretching the and hushed with buzzing

32
00:02:38.60 --> 00:02:42.52
night flies to thy slumber?

33
00:02:42.52 --> 00:02:50.86
And in perfumed chambers of the great under the canopies of costly state and lulled with

34
00:02:50.86 --> 00:02:54.96
sound of sweetest melody.

35
00:02:54.96 --> 00:02:56.52
So he's asking sleep.

36
00:02:56.52 --> 00:02:57.76
He's saying, look, sleep.

37
00:02:57.76 --> 00:02:58.76
You're there.

38
00:02:58.76 --> 00:03:04.12
You're there hanging out with the smoky filthy houses and hovels and people are sleeping

39
00:03:04.12 --> 00:03:08.36
on boards and to low people are sleeping.

40
00:03:08.36 --> 00:03:13.52
Those situations, it's insects buzzing around their heads.

41
00:03:13.52 --> 00:03:15.36
You sleep's all there.

42
00:03:15.36 --> 00:03:17.16
Taking care of those people.

43
00:03:17.16 --> 00:03:24.68
But sleep doesn't come to him in the most beautiful in the most luxurious, astate rooms,

44
00:03:24.68 --> 00:03:27.64
where there's a little gentle music playing.

45
00:03:27.64 --> 00:03:28.64
No bugs flying around.

46
00:03:28.64 --> 00:03:33.52
It's a gentle music playing.

47
00:03:33.52 --> 00:03:42.72
Back to the play, oh thou doggard, why lieest thou with the vile in loen some beds and

48
00:03:42.72 --> 00:03:50.88
leaveest thy kingly couch, a watch case, or a common larym bell.

49
00:03:50.88 --> 00:03:57.76
So same, same subject he's saying, look, why do you doggard, so dogg meaning sleeping?

50
00:03:57.76 --> 00:04:04.36
Don't worry, why are you hanging around the nastiest beds, but you know, this beautiful

51
00:04:04.36 --> 00:04:06.16
bed, you don't come near it.

52
00:04:06.16 --> 00:04:14.08
You leave it vacant, like a watch tower, like a bell tower.

53
00:04:14.08 --> 00:04:21.20
Will thou upon the high and giddy mast seal up the ship boys eyes?

54
00:04:21.20 --> 00:04:26.28
So now he's talking to start talking about even a sailor at sea.

55
00:04:26.28 --> 00:04:33.12
High up on a mast, right, a giddy mast.

56
00:04:33.12 --> 00:04:40.56
You seal up the ship boys eyes and rock his brains in cradle of the rude, imperious

57
00:04:40.56 --> 00:04:42.04
surge.

58
00:04:42.04 --> 00:04:48.36
And in the visitation of winds who take the ruffian billows by the top curling their monstrous

59
00:04:48.36 --> 00:04:55.32
heads and hanging them with deafening clamor in the slippery clouds that with the

60
00:04:55.32 --> 00:05:01.16
early death itself awakes.

61
00:05:01.16 --> 00:05:07.80
So he's saying this sailor, there's a sailor at sea who's getting punished by the storm

62
00:05:07.80 --> 00:05:14.12
and the thunder is cropping and the ship is bounding back and forth.

63
00:05:14.12 --> 00:05:15.12
But guess what?

64
00:05:15.12 --> 00:05:16.80
He gets to fall asleep.

65
00:05:16.80 --> 00:05:22.28
He goes to sleep, no problem.

66
00:05:22.28 --> 00:05:31.52
It's thou oparsal sleep, give thy repose to the wet sea boy in an hour so rude and in

67
00:05:31.52 --> 00:05:41.28
the calmest and most stillest night with all appliances and means to boot the night to a

68
00:05:41.28 --> 00:05:43.96
king.

69
00:05:43.96 --> 00:05:50.72
So he's saying again, in an hour so rude storms mayhem at sea.

70
00:05:50.72 --> 00:05:53.88
He gives the, he gives the sailor sleep.

71
00:05:53.88 --> 00:06:04.000
But in this calmest and most stillest night with every available luxury to boot, yet

72
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.44
sleep is denied to the king.

73
00:06:07.44 --> 00:06:19.32
And then he says, then happy low lie down, uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.

74
00:06:19.32 --> 00:06:24.08
So then happy low lie down, he's saying, look, low by low, he means the peasants.

75
00:06:24.08 --> 00:06:33.40
He's like, all right, then you happy happy low, you peasants lie down, lie down, sleep.

76
00:06:33.40 --> 00:06:37.08
That's what you get.

77
00:06:37.08 --> 00:06:41.32
But uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.

78
00:06:41.32 --> 00:06:45.32
The leader doesn't get to rest.

79
00:06:45.32 --> 00:06:46.60
The leader doesn't get to sleep.

80
00:06:46.60 --> 00:06:53.60
And that's another example of what we know and that is that leadership is hard.

81
00:06:53.60 --> 00:07:03.24
It's a heavy burden, it's hard business and it's part science and part art.

82
00:07:03.24 --> 00:07:08.36
And part of it is natural ability and part of it is learned and the book that we're going

83
00:07:08.36 --> 00:07:12.24
to dive into today, it isn't Shakespeare.

84
00:07:12.24 --> 00:07:21.36
That's actually a military manual, military manual written by SLA Marshall, but guided

85
00:07:21.36 --> 00:07:26.92
by George C. Marshall and Dwight D. Eisenhower.

86
00:07:26.92 --> 00:07:29.84
This book was written just after World War II.

87
00:07:29.84 --> 00:07:35.32
Now, if you remember Hackworth, if you read about face, Hackworth talks about Marshall,

88
00:07:35.32 --> 00:07:42.20
SLA Marshall and he did some writing in Vietnam that Hackworth was a little bit

89
00:07:42.20 --> 00:07:43.68
not impressed with.

90
00:07:43.68 --> 00:07:49.68
And there's certainly some controversy about SLA Marshall and some of the things that he wrote

91
00:07:49.68 --> 00:07:53.80
in some of the things that he said that he lived through, there's some controversy,

92
00:07:53.80 --> 00:07:58.52
if not proven fact that he fabricated some stuff.

93
00:07:58.52 --> 00:08:03.72
But I think you're going to find as we dive into this book, that from a leadership perspective,

94
00:08:03.72 --> 00:08:07.48
the experiences that he did bring back from World War I, the experiences that he got from

95
00:08:07.48 --> 00:08:11.20
Eisenhower and from the other Marshall.

96
00:08:11.20 --> 00:08:17.60
I think it's a really good reflection in a good look at some leadership lessons learned

97
00:08:17.60 --> 00:08:19.32
that we can take something from.

98
00:08:19.32 --> 00:08:26.68
Now, the book is actually called the Armed Forces Officer, very simple title, and the

99
00:08:26.68 --> 00:08:31.60
version that I'm going through, because this book is still in publication, the version that

100
00:08:31.60 --> 00:08:38.44
I'm going through is from 1950, 1950 version.

101
00:08:38.44 --> 00:08:43.48
Like I said, it's written in just after World War II, obviously, so the lessons are fresh.

102
00:08:43.48 --> 00:08:51.40
And I guess that the new version has been cleaned up or something.

103
00:08:51.40 --> 00:08:56.96
There's, I guess that the 1950s version isn't fully politically correct.

104
00:08:56.96 --> 00:09:00.80
I don't know because to be frank, I haven't read the new version, because I got the old

105
00:09:00.80 --> 00:09:01.80
version.

106
00:09:01.80 --> 00:09:03.84
I want the real deal.

107
00:09:03.84 --> 00:09:08.40
And I don't find anything offensive in this one, so maybe someone else will.

108
00:09:08.40 --> 00:09:14.48
I guess there's some things that might be a little bit borderline, but yeah, I'm not,

109
00:09:14.48 --> 00:09:16.16
I'm not really feeling it.

110
00:09:16.16 --> 00:09:19.32
And this book was given me a long time ago by a friend of mine that said, you might

111
00:09:19.32 --> 00:09:20.84
like this.

112
00:09:20.84 --> 00:09:24.64
And he specifically said, this boy, they'll make this one anymore.

113
00:09:24.64 --> 00:09:25.64
But guess what?

114
00:09:25.64 --> 00:09:27.04
Everyone's in love because they do.

115
00:09:27.04 --> 00:09:28.84
They brought it back.

116
00:09:28.84 --> 00:09:30.28
They brought it back.

117
00:09:30.28 --> 00:09:38.36
So the book is the Armed Forces Officer, and it really goes into how to lead, how to lead.

118
00:09:38.36 --> 00:09:40.88
So go into the book.

119
00:09:40.88 --> 00:09:48.44
To call forth great loyalty and other people and to harness it to any noble undertaking, one

120
00:09:48.44 --> 00:09:54.76
must first be sensible of their finer instincts and feelings.

121
00:09:54.76 --> 00:10:02.64
Certainly, these things at least are among the gentle qualities which are desired in every

122
00:10:02.64 --> 00:10:04.60
military officer of the United States.

123
00:10:04.60 --> 00:10:10.04
So here's some basic things that the officers, the military are supposed to have.

124
00:10:10.04 --> 00:10:12.60
One, strong belief in human rights.

125
00:10:12.60 --> 00:10:16.84
Two, respect for the dignity of every other person.

126
00:10:16.84 --> 00:10:23.88
Three, the golden rule attitude toward one's daily associates.

127
00:10:23.88 --> 00:10:28.88
Four, an abiding interest in all aspects of human welfare.

128
00:10:28.88 --> 00:10:37.60
Five, a willingness to deal with every man as considerably as if he were a blood relative.

129
00:10:37.60 --> 00:10:40.12
So pretty simple rules.

130
00:10:40.12 --> 00:10:41.84
Respect other people.

131
00:10:41.84 --> 00:10:45.48
The golden rule, you know, treat people how you want to be treated yourself.

132
00:10:45.48 --> 00:10:48.12
These are the basis what they're saying, you need to be.

133
00:10:48.12 --> 00:10:51.84
And again, let's not actually, I was going to go into this, but they're going to go into

134
00:10:51.84 --> 00:10:52.84
themselves.

135
00:10:52.84 --> 00:10:53.84
Here we go.

136
00:10:53.84 --> 00:10:54.84
Back to the book.

137
00:10:54.84 --> 00:10:59.48
The epitome of strength, not of softness.

138
00:10:59.48 --> 00:11:06.32
They marked a man who's capable of pursuing a great purpose consistently in spite of temptations.

139
00:11:06.32 --> 00:11:13.64
He who possesses them will all the more surely be regarded as a man among men.

140
00:11:13.64 --> 00:11:15.36
Take any crowd of new recruits.

141
00:11:15.36 --> 00:11:19.68
The greater number of them during their first few days in service will use more profanity

142
00:11:19.68 --> 00:11:20.68
and obscenity.

143
00:11:20.68 --> 00:11:24.56
Let's talk more about women and boast more about drinking than they have ever done in their

144
00:11:24.56 --> 00:11:30.12
lives because of the mistaken idea that this is the quick way to get a reputation for being

145
00:11:30.12 --> 00:11:32.92
a hard-boiled.

146
00:11:32.92 --> 00:11:38.92
But at the same time, the one or two men among them who stay decent, talk moderately

147
00:11:38.92 --> 00:11:46.48
and walk the line of duty will uniquely receive the infinite respect of the others.

148
00:11:46.48 --> 00:11:50.20
It never fails to happen.

149
00:11:50.20 --> 00:11:53.56
So little contrary to what we might think.

150
00:11:53.56 --> 00:11:56.000
And there's definitely, when you get the military and you're going through boot camp,

151
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.56
there's all kinds of people act in tough guys.

152
00:11:58.56 --> 00:12:01.52
All kinds of people act in tough guys.

153
00:12:01.52 --> 00:12:06.32
And that happens to see one thing that happens in boot camp.

154
00:12:06.32 --> 00:12:11.56
I bet I met more potential professional athletes when I was going through.

155
00:12:11.56 --> 00:12:15.28
When I was going through boot camp, everyone was, I was about to go in the NFL.

156
00:12:15.28 --> 00:12:17.96
I was about to be a pro baseball player.

157
00:12:17.96 --> 00:12:21.48
I don't know why, but they end up in the military.

158
00:12:21.48 --> 00:12:23.48
Yeah, it is interesting.

159
00:12:23.48 --> 00:12:26.48
That kind of like the guy who's 500 in the streets.

160
00:12:26.48 --> 00:12:27.48
Yeah.

161
00:12:27.48 --> 00:12:28.48
They come to the MMA gym.

162
00:12:28.48 --> 00:12:31.68
That guy doesn't work out too well.

163
00:12:31.68 --> 00:12:37.08
Alright, and obviously I'm abridging this book a little bit, skipping through.

164
00:12:37.08 --> 00:12:42.40
Here we go back to the book, Men Be Get Good Will in Other Men by Giving It.

165
00:12:42.40 --> 00:12:47.16
They develop courage and they're following mainly as a reflection of the courage, which

166
00:12:47.16 --> 00:12:50.48
they show in their own action.

167
00:12:50.48 --> 00:12:56.16
These two qualities of mind and heart are the essence of sound, officer ship.

168
00:12:56.16 --> 00:13:02.52
One is of little avail without the other and either helps to sustain the other.

169
00:13:02.52 --> 00:13:10.28
So you got goodwill and you got courage and they help each other and they sustain each other.

170
00:13:10.28 --> 00:13:15.68
Back to the book, as to which is the stronger force in its impact upon the masses of men.

171
00:13:15.68 --> 00:13:21.28
No truth is more certain than the words once written by William James.

172
00:13:21.28 --> 00:13:26.76
Evident, though the shortcomings of a man may be, if he is ready to give up his life

173
00:13:26.76 --> 00:13:30.24
for a cause, we forgive him everything.

174
00:13:30.24 --> 00:13:35.48
However inferior he may be to ourselves and other respects, if we cling to life while

175
00:13:35.48 --> 00:13:40.88
he throws it away like a flower, we bow to his superiority.

176
00:13:40.88 --> 00:13:46.04
So I guess courage gets the stronger nod out of that situation.

177
00:13:46.04 --> 00:13:51.44
Back to the book, Peter Roosevelt once said, if he had a son who refrained from any worthwhile

178
00:13:51.44 --> 00:13:57.88
action because of the fear of hurt to himself, he would disown him.

179
00:13:57.88 --> 00:14:02.40
Soon after his return to civilian life, General Dwight D. Eisenhower spoke of the

180
00:14:02.40 --> 00:14:06.44
worthy worth whileness of living dangerously.

181
00:14:06.44 --> 00:14:12.32
On officer of the United States armed forces cannot go far wrong if he holds these ideas.

182
00:14:12.32 --> 00:14:17.52
It is not the suitable profession for those who believe only in digging in and nursing a soft

183
00:14:17.52 --> 00:14:21.16
snap until death comes at a ripe old age.

184
00:14:21.16 --> 00:14:24.76
Who risks nothing gains nothing.

185
00:14:24.76 --> 00:14:31.76
Nor should there be any room in it for professional smugness, small jellacies and undue

186
00:14:31.76 --> 00:14:36.40
concern about privilege.

187
00:14:36.40 --> 00:14:40.48
So you can't be hiding all the time.

188
00:14:40.48 --> 00:14:44.64
You got to step up, you got to lead, you got to take some risk, you got to leave dangerously.

189
00:14:44.64 --> 00:14:49.36
Now of course, young troopers out there, especially guys out on the battlefield, this doesn't

190
00:14:49.36 --> 00:14:50.84
mean running to your death.

191
00:14:50.84 --> 00:14:54.08
That's not what it means.

192
00:14:54.08 --> 00:14:58.40
You will take risk in business world, you'll take risk.

193
00:14:58.40 --> 00:15:00.48
In the military, you'll take risk.

194
00:15:00.48 --> 00:15:07.08
If you do either in business or in a military, you take risk stupidly, you'll die or you'll

195
00:15:07.08 --> 00:15:09.08
lose all your money.

196
00:15:09.08 --> 00:15:12.36
Neither one of those is good.

197
00:15:12.36 --> 00:15:18.20
But that doesn't mean you hide and doesn't mean you take no risk and you shy away.

198
00:15:18.20 --> 00:15:23.76
Now the next part, when he's talking about small jellacies and undue concern about privilege,

199
00:15:23.76 --> 00:15:27.44
this eats people up and destroys people.

200
00:15:27.44 --> 00:15:31.60
And that light here we go back to the book towards services other than his own.

201
00:15:31.60 --> 00:15:39.32
Any officer is expected to have both a comradly feeling and an imaginative interest.

202
00:15:39.32 --> 00:15:45.36
Any army officer is a better man for having studied the works of Admiral Mayhand and familiar

203
00:15:45.36 --> 00:15:49.24
lies himself with the modern navy from first-hand experience.

204
00:15:49.24 --> 00:15:54.08
Those who lead sea going forces can enlarge their own capacities by knowing more rather

205
00:15:54.08 --> 00:15:58.48
than less about the nature of the air and ground establishments.

206
00:15:58.48 --> 00:16:03.56
The sub-mariner can always learn something useful to his own work by mingling with airmen.

207
00:16:03.56 --> 00:16:08.36
The airmen becomes a better officer as he grows in qualified knowledge of ground and

208
00:16:08.36 --> 00:16:10.60
sea fighting.

209
00:16:10.60 --> 00:16:12.44
So you've got to learn.

210
00:16:12.44 --> 00:16:14.000
Working with other industries?

211
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.64
Learn about those industries.

212
00:16:15.64 --> 00:16:17.20
Learn as much as you can.

213
00:16:17.20 --> 00:16:21.96
Don't just stay in your own little world because your comfort lesson would happen to

214
00:16:21.96 --> 00:16:22.96
a lot of us.

215
00:16:22.96 --> 00:16:25.44
You get comfortable in your own world so that's what you want to stay in.

216
00:16:25.44 --> 00:16:27.08
You don't want to look bad.

217
00:16:27.08 --> 00:16:28.28
You don't want to appear to be ignorant.

218
00:16:28.28 --> 00:16:34.28
And Admiral Mayhand is kind of the, well, he was a civil war Admiral as a matter of fact,

219
00:16:34.28 --> 00:16:40.32
but wrote a book called The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, which the Germans and

220
00:16:40.32 --> 00:16:43.56
the Japanese both utilized against the whole world, too.

221
00:16:43.56 --> 00:16:47.60
So a little bit of a little bit of a risk there, but it's also something that guided the

222
00:16:47.60 --> 00:16:52.64
fought and the building of the modern US Navy.

223
00:16:52.64 --> 00:16:57.60
Now we talk a little bit about what life is like in the military back to the book.

224
00:16:57.60 --> 00:17:01.76
The military way is a long, hard road.

225
00:17:01.76 --> 00:17:05.28
And it makes extraordinary requirements of every individual.

226
00:17:05.28 --> 00:17:11.04
In war, particularly it puts stresses upon men such as they have not known elsewhere.

227
00:17:11.04 --> 00:17:16.64
And the temptation to get out from under would be irresistible if their spirits had not

228
00:17:16.64 --> 00:17:19.64
been tempered to the ordeal.

229
00:17:19.64 --> 00:17:20.80
So you got to be ready for the hardest.

230
00:17:20.80 --> 00:17:24.84
You got to do things in your life that get you ready for the hardness back to the book.

231
00:17:24.84 --> 00:17:28.52
If nothing but fear, and this is what we're getting to some leadership, if nothing but

232
00:17:28.52 --> 00:17:35.40
fear of punishments were dependent upon to hold men to the line during extreme trial,

233
00:17:35.40 --> 00:17:42.80
the result would be wholesale, mutiny, and a situation altogether beyond the control of leadership.

234
00:17:42.80 --> 00:17:45.84
So if the only thing, the only reason that your people are following you because it's

235
00:17:45.84 --> 00:17:53.28
because of fear of punishment, when the going gets hard, that's not going to work.

236
00:17:53.28 --> 00:18:00.32
So it must be true that it is the out, that is out of the impact of ideals.

237
00:18:00.32 --> 00:18:05.32
Out of the impact of ideals, mainly that men develop the strength to face situations,

238
00:18:05.32 --> 00:18:10.64
which would be normal to run away, which it would be normal to run away.

239
00:18:10.64 --> 00:18:16.40
So during the normal routine of peace, members of the armed services are expected to respond

240
00:18:16.40 --> 00:18:21.72
to situations that are more extensive, more complex, then take longer to reach fulfillment

241
00:18:21.72 --> 00:18:25.88
than the situations to which the majority of men instinctively respond.

242
00:18:25.88 --> 00:18:29.96
So things in the military take a long time in your big part of that in a peace time,

243
00:18:29.96 --> 00:18:33.92
big bureaucratic machine, it can be really challenging.

244
00:18:33.92 --> 00:18:40.16
Even the length of the enlistment period looks like a slow march up a 60 mile grade.

245
00:18:40.16 --> 00:18:44.36
The motion is slow, duty frequently, monotonous.

246
00:18:44.36 --> 00:18:49.84
It is all too easy for the individual to worry about his own insignificance and to feel

247
00:18:49.84 --> 00:18:53.52
that he has become lost in the crowd.

248
00:18:53.52 --> 00:18:57.000
Now this is something that I hear a lot about on social media.

249
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.96
More people send me messages on this or Facebook messages, I guess, when they feel like

250
00:19:03.96 --> 00:19:07.36
they're caught in a rut, you know, they're doing their job, they don't really like it.

251
00:19:07.36 --> 00:19:09.000
What should I do?

252
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.48
And I think this next little section applies to that back to the book, what is the main

253
00:19:13.48 --> 00:19:16.52
test of human character?

254
00:19:16.52 --> 00:19:24.28
Probably it is this, that a man will know how to be patient in the midst of hard circumstance

255
00:19:24.28 --> 00:19:30.04
and can continue to be personally effective while living through whatever discouragements

256
00:19:30.04 --> 00:19:34.32
beset him and his companions.

257
00:19:34.32 --> 00:19:35.88
Can you drive on?

258
00:19:35.88 --> 00:19:36.88
That's what it's asking.

259
00:19:36.88 --> 00:19:38.88
Those are the job that you don't like?

260
00:19:38.88 --> 00:19:39.88
Good.

261
00:19:39.88 --> 00:19:40.88
Good.

262
00:19:40.88 --> 00:19:42.16
It's a little test.

263
00:19:42.16 --> 00:19:47.12
Now, if you're in a situation that you don't like, you drive on in that situation and

264
00:19:47.12 --> 00:19:49.32
also you figure out what your exit is going to be.

265
00:19:49.32 --> 00:19:51.76
Because you don't want to go through life miserable.

266
00:19:51.76 --> 00:19:55.08
You figure out, you start saving your money, you start getting on another education,

267
00:19:55.08 --> 00:19:57.40
you figure out how to do the job, you get yourself promoted, you do what you've got to

268
00:19:57.40 --> 00:19:58.40
do.

269
00:19:58.40 --> 00:20:02.88
But don't let that monotonous job that you're not into that date, don't let that bird

270
00:20:02.88 --> 00:20:03.88
you down.

271
00:20:03.88 --> 00:20:04.88
Yeah.

272
00:20:04.88 --> 00:20:08.88
You drive on in life.

273
00:20:08.88 --> 00:20:12.88
You don't necessarily have to drive on and keep doing that job.

274
00:20:12.88 --> 00:20:18.88
You drive on as opposed to, oh, start complaining or going to some thing where you get

275
00:20:18.88 --> 00:20:23.88
self-destruct, ever you see some kind of escapees out later, something like that.

276
00:20:23.88 --> 00:20:28.28
But I'll tell you, you drive on, you have other options, right?

277
00:20:28.28 --> 00:20:29.88
You work those other options.

278
00:20:29.88 --> 00:20:32.88
But whatever it is that your job is and you kick acid that job.

279
00:20:32.88 --> 00:20:33.88
That's what you do.

280
00:20:33.88 --> 00:20:36.88
The minute you start slack and you're going backwards, don't do it.

281
00:20:36.88 --> 00:20:38.88
It's not going to be what benefit are you going to get from that.

282
00:20:38.88 --> 00:20:39.88
You're going to get zero benefit.

283
00:20:39.88 --> 00:20:41.88
You're going to work your eight hours a day.

284
00:20:41.88 --> 00:20:44.88
You're going to make your $12 an hour.

285
00:20:44.88 --> 00:20:46.88
Are you going to do it in a slack way?

286
00:20:46.88 --> 00:20:47.88
Yeah.

287
00:20:47.88 --> 00:20:49.88
Or are you going to do it in an awesome way?

288
00:20:49.88 --> 00:20:50.88
Right.

289
00:20:50.88 --> 00:20:52.88
You know, I'm going to do it in an awesome way.

290
00:20:52.88 --> 00:20:53.88
Yeah.

291
00:20:53.88 --> 00:20:54.88
And that's what's going to get you promoted.

292
00:20:54.88 --> 00:20:55.88
That's what's going to get you.

293
00:20:55.88 --> 00:20:57.88
That's what's going to get you taking care of.

294
00:20:57.88 --> 00:20:58.88
In the long run.

295
00:20:58.88 --> 00:21:02.88
If you, or you, you, like you say this a lot, where you, like you're going to get

296
00:21:02.88 --> 00:21:05.88
out where you, like even if you're going to do something, even if you don't enjoy, you still

297
00:21:05.88 --> 00:21:06.88
you do it just the best you can.

298
00:21:06.88 --> 00:21:08.88
You said that like from the beginning.

299
00:21:08.88 --> 00:21:15.88
And for someone like me when I look at it like that, of course it sounds like

300
00:21:15.88 --> 00:21:16.88
good idea.

301
00:21:16.88 --> 00:21:17.88
Do it that way.

302
00:21:17.88 --> 00:21:19.88
But after you do it, you kind of think back.

303
00:21:19.88 --> 00:21:20.88
And I've done both.

304
00:21:20.88 --> 00:21:22.88
I've done it where I'm like, well, I hate doing this.

305
00:21:22.88 --> 00:21:26.88
So I'm just going to basically go through the motions until it's finally done.

306
00:21:26.88 --> 00:21:29.88
You know, and I can be relieved or whatever.

307
00:21:29.88 --> 00:21:34.88
But when you think back of like, hey, remember when I was doing whatever it is that job or

308
00:21:34.88 --> 00:21:40.88
whatever, when you look back, you kind of have this fulfillment that you did it the best

309
00:21:40.88 --> 00:21:41.88
you get.

310
00:21:41.88 --> 00:21:44.88
You never look back and be like, dang, I'm glad I've phoned it in.

311
00:21:44.88 --> 00:21:47.88
You know, you're always, you're going even if you didn't like it.

312
00:21:47.88 --> 00:21:51.88
Like you, you're always satisfied that that, yeah, I did it the best that I could.

313
00:21:51.88 --> 00:21:52.88
So do it.

314
00:21:52.88 --> 00:21:53.88
Yeah.

315
00:21:53.88 --> 00:21:55.88
Do it the best you can.

316
00:21:55.88 --> 00:21:59.88
Now, here's a couple of the lists in this book. Here's another one.

317
00:21:59.88 --> 00:22:06.88
This is the one that's talking about the simple virtues that provide a firm foundation.

318
00:22:06.88 --> 00:22:08.88
So here we go.

319
00:22:08.88 --> 00:22:10.88
One, a man has honor.

320
00:22:10.88 --> 00:22:18.88
If he holds himself to a course of conduct because of a conviction that it is in the general interest,

321
00:22:18.88 --> 00:22:24.88
even though he is well aware that it may lead to inconvenience, personal loss, humiliation or

322
00:22:24.88 --> 00:22:25.88
grave physical risk.

323
00:22:25.88 --> 00:22:28.88
So when he says general interest, he's talking about like the team.

324
00:22:28.88 --> 00:22:33.88
So you're going to hold that conviction, even if it's good for the team, you're going to hold that course.

325
00:22:33.88 --> 00:22:40.88
Even if you're well aware that it may lead to inconvenience, personal loss, humiliation or grave physical risk.

326
00:22:40.88 --> 00:22:41.88
Boom.

327
00:22:41.88 --> 00:22:42.88
That's what honor is.

328
00:22:42.88 --> 00:22:44.88
You know, here, honor laid out that well.

329
00:22:44.88 --> 00:22:45.88
Very often.

330
00:22:45.88 --> 00:22:47.88
He has veracity.

331
00:22:47.88 --> 00:22:53.88
If having studied a question to the limit of his ability, he says and believes what he thinks to be true.

332
00:22:53.88 --> 00:23:01.88
Even though it would be the path of least resistance to deceive others and himself.

333
00:23:01.88 --> 00:23:04.88
So this is kind of in the same vein.

334
00:23:04.88 --> 00:23:09.88
If you look at something and maybe you don't agree with it, but the easiest thing to do is just be agree with it.

335
00:23:09.88 --> 00:23:10.88
No, you don't do that.

336
00:23:10.88 --> 00:23:13.88
You step on saying, no, I don't agree with this.

337
00:23:13.88 --> 00:23:15.88
Now we could go into detail on that.

338
00:23:15.88 --> 00:23:22.88
In the time is when you, when you do want to maybe not be the most truthful person in the world.

339
00:23:22.88 --> 00:23:28.88
For instance, we've talked about this before when your wife is making chicken and it's dry.

340
00:23:28.88 --> 00:23:29.88
Right?

341
00:23:29.88 --> 00:23:35.88
It might not be the best thing to tell her the amount of water that you're going to need to drink.

342
00:23:35.88 --> 00:23:42.88
So, but in real things and important things, tell the truth.

343
00:23:42.88 --> 00:23:43.88
Back to the book.

344
00:23:43.88 --> 00:23:44.88
Number three, he has justice.

345
00:23:44.88 --> 00:23:51.88
If he acknowledges the interests of all concerned in any particular transaction, rather than serving his own apparent.

346
00:23:51.88 --> 00:23:53.88
And his own apparent interest.

347
00:23:53.88 --> 00:23:55.88
Look out for others.

348
00:23:55.88 --> 00:23:57.88
Number four, he has graciousness.

349
00:23:57.88 --> 00:24:05.88
If he acts and speaks forthrightly, agrees warmly, disagree fairly and respectfully.

350
00:24:05.88 --> 00:24:08.88
Participates enthusiastically.

351
00:24:08.88 --> 00:24:12.88
Refrains from harboring grudges.

352
00:24:12.88 --> 00:24:19.88
Takes his reverses in stride and does not complain or ask for help in the face of trifling.

353
00:24:19.88 --> 00:24:23.88
Calamities.

354
00:24:23.88 --> 00:24:25.88
Those are just solid.

355
00:24:25.88 --> 00:24:26.88
Those are just solid.

356
00:24:26.88 --> 00:24:27.88
I would say this though.

357
00:24:27.88 --> 00:24:29.88
Sometimes you got to ask for help.

358
00:24:29.88 --> 00:24:30.88
Right?

359
00:24:30.88 --> 00:24:32.88
That's one thing that I wouldn't work with businesses.

360
00:24:32.88 --> 00:24:37.88
There'll be somebody that's, you know, I'm the extreme ownership and I'm an own this.

361
00:24:37.88 --> 00:24:40.88
And all of a sudden you realize, hey, you're own in that, but you're not going to be successful at it.

362
00:24:40.88 --> 00:24:42.88
Because that's too much for you.

363
00:24:42.88 --> 00:24:43.88
You need help.

364
00:24:43.88 --> 00:24:45.88
You need to, you need to put your ego in check.

365
00:24:45.88 --> 00:24:48.88
And you need to be able to raise your hand and say, look, I need some help on this.

366
00:24:48.88 --> 00:24:49.88
I don't have this covered.

367
00:24:49.88 --> 00:24:50.88
This is too much for me.

368
00:24:50.88 --> 00:24:51.88
I want to expect in this.

369
00:24:51.88 --> 00:24:52.88
Here's my hands in the air.

370
00:24:52.88 --> 00:24:53.88
Let me, let me get some help.

371
00:24:53.88 --> 00:24:56.88
Sometimes seems like it's not necessarily even ego.

372
00:24:56.88 --> 00:24:59.88
It's more like, oh, I guess it in a way to ego, but it's more like, shoot.

373
00:24:59.88 --> 00:25:04.88
I don't want to be the guy who has to be dependent on somebody or something like that.

374
00:25:04.88 --> 00:25:05.88
Like, you know, which is what?

375
00:25:05.88 --> 00:25:06.88
Extreme ownership.

376
00:25:06.88 --> 00:25:07.88
Which is ego.

377
00:25:07.88 --> 00:25:10.88
Actually, if you're the guy that doesn't want to be dependent on other people, that's probably

378
00:25:10.88 --> 00:25:11.88
ego.

379
00:25:11.88 --> 00:25:16.88
But you are, I think what you're trying to say is that I don't want to be the guy that has to ask for help.

380
00:25:16.88 --> 00:25:17.88
I want to be the guy that carries my own load.

381
00:25:17.88 --> 00:25:18.88
Like, you know what?

382
00:25:18.88 --> 00:25:20.88
I'd see this on seal patrols.

383
00:25:20.88 --> 00:25:27.88
A couple times in my career where guys were overloaded and they didn't want to ask for help.

384
00:25:27.88 --> 00:25:28.88
Right.

385
00:25:28.88 --> 00:25:29.88
I got this.

386
00:25:29.88 --> 00:25:30.88
Because it's humiliating.

387
00:25:30.88 --> 00:25:34.88
You know, hey, can you carry my ammunition or hey, can you carry my radio?

388
00:25:34.88 --> 00:25:35.88
Yeah.

389
00:25:35.88 --> 00:25:36.88
Can you carry my weapon?

390
00:25:36.88 --> 00:25:39.88
That's, I've seen it happen.

391
00:25:39.88 --> 00:25:42.88
I've carried some extra weapons from time to time.

392
00:25:42.88 --> 00:25:44.88
It's a bummer, you know?

393
00:25:44.88 --> 00:25:46.88
And you know what?

394
00:25:46.88 --> 00:25:47.88
You take the weapon?

395
00:25:47.88 --> 00:25:50.88
Hey, man, okay, get the water in you.

396
00:25:50.88 --> 00:25:51.88
You know?

397
00:25:51.88 --> 00:25:52.88
But that's what you're talking about.

398
00:25:52.88 --> 00:25:53.88
People don't want to be that guy.

399
00:25:53.88 --> 00:26:00.88
But what's going to be worse if they don't take a load off and they get heat casualty

400
00:26:00.88 --> 00:26:01.88
and now they're down.

401
00:26:01.88 --> 00:26:03.88
Well, now we're now I've got to carry him.

402
00:26:03.88 --> 00:26:05.88
Not this is weapon.

403
00:26:05.88 --> 00:26:06.88
Which is a bad thing.

404
00:26:06.88 --> 00:26:07.88
We don't have him anymore.

405
00:26:07.88 --> 00:26:08.88
Yeah.

406
00:26:08.88 --> 00:26:09.88
Yeah.

407
00:26:09.88 --> 00:26:10.88
And he can't take a fight.

408
00:26:10.88 --> 00:26:12.88
He can't even do anything.

409
00:26:12.88 --> 00:26:16.68
As opposed to the other guy who doesn't know the difference between needing help and

410
00:26:16.68 --> 00:26:17.68
wanting help.

411
00:26:17.68 --> 00:26:18.68
Yeah.

412
00:26:18.68 --> 00:26:19.68
And he knows just like, well help me.

413
00:26:19.68 --> 00:26:20.68
Yeah.

414
00:26:20.68 --> 00:26:21.68
Because he don't want to work.

415
00:26:21.68 --> 00:26:24.68
I had a guy who had we were on a long patrol.

416
00:26:24.68 --> 00:26:27.68
This is back in the day, back in the day.

417
00:26:27.68 --> 00:26:29.68
This is pre-war.

418
00:26:29.68 --> 00:26:32.68
And my radio meant, because I was a radio man when I was in the city.

419
00:26:32.68 --> 00:26:34.68
And now it wasn't a radio man.

420
00:26:34.68 --> 00:26:37.68
I was an officer and we were on a long patrol.

421
00:26:37.68 --> 00:26:39.68
And my radio man was going down.

422
00:26:39.68 --> 00:26:41.68
Like he was, didn't have enough water.

423
00:26:41.68 --> 00:26:42.68
He was dehydrated.

424
00:26:42.68 --> 00:26:44.68
And so he was bummed.

425
00:26:44.68 --> 00:26:48.68
He couldn't keep up with this anymore.

426
00:26:48.68 --> 00:26:50.68
And I said, OK, let me get you radio.

427
00:26:50.68 --> 00:26:52.68
So I'm taking a 20 pound radio off his back.

428
00:26:52.68 --> 00:26:53.68
Put him in my back.

429
00:26:53.68 --> 00:26:55.68
And I'm carrying it for a little bit, I don't know.

430
00:26:55.68 --> 00:26:56.68
A half a day.

431
00:26:56.68 --> 00:26:59.68
And then we get to a, like, a layup point.

432
00:26:59.68 --> 00:27:01.68
So this is where we're going to first civilian.

433
00:27:01.68 --> 00:27:03.68
This is where we're going to camp out for the night.

434
00:27:03.68 --> 00:27:07.68
And when we get there, we get a resupply of water and, you know,

435
00:27:07.68 --> 00:27:08.68
gate or gate or whatever.

436
00:27:08.68 --> 00:27:11.68
So all of a sudden now everyone's rehydrated.

437
00:27:11.68 --> 00:27:13.68
And while we're in there, we got to make a community

438
00:27:13.68 --> 00:27:16.68
and we got to make a communications hit to, you know,

439
00:27:16.68 --> 00:27:19.68
got to call headquarters and say, hey, this is our location.

440
00:27:19.68 --> 00:27:25.68
So he comes and takes the radio out of my, out of my backpack.

441
00:27:25.68 --> 00:27:26.68
You know, it comes over and hit the radio.

442
00:27:26.68 --> 00:27:27.68
So I can make this communication.

443
00:27:27.68 --> 00:27:29.68
I go, yeah, cool, open up my bag.

444
00:27:29.68 --> 00:27:30.68
Give it to him.

445
00:27:30.68 --> 00:27:33.68
And, you know, he makes the radio communications.

446
00:27:33.68 --> 00:27:36.68
And I'm out doing, like, a reconnaissance of the area to find out what

447
00:27:36.68 --> 00:27:38.68
wrote we're going to take.

448
00:27:38.68 --> 00:27:41.68
Anyways, I thought, you know, not his rehydrated.

449
00:27:41.68 --> 00:27:44.68
He's going to take that radio and, you know, we'll be back in the back of the game.

450
00:27:44.68 --> 00:27:49.68
So I come back and when I get back, the radio was sitting on my rock set.

451
00:27:49.68 --> 00:27:51.68
Oh, my god.

452
00:27:51.68 --> 00:27:52.68
Oh, my god.

453
00:27:52.68 --> 00:27:53.68
Oh, no.

454
00:27:53.68 --> 00:27:54.68
But you know what I did?

455
00:27:54.68 --> 00:27:55.68
Put it back in my rock set.

456
00:27:55.68 --> 00:27:56.68
I'm scared of it.

457
00:27:56.68 --> 00:27:57.68
Yeah, you just gotta do it.

458
00:27:57.68 --> 00:27:59.68
But yeah, so you, you don't want to be that guy.

459
00:27:59.68 --> 00:28:00.68
Yeah.

460
00:28:00.68 --> 00:28:02.68
Once you get rehydrated, man, get your way back on.

461
00:28:02.68 --> 00:28:03.68
Yeah.

462
00:28:03.68 --> 00:28:07.68
That difference between needing help and a one.

463
00:28:07.68 --> 00:28:08.68
Yeah.

464
00:28:08.68 --> 00:28:09.68
And he did need help.

465
00:28:09.68 --> 00:28:10.68
Yeah.

466
00:28:10.68 --> 00:28:13.68
But once the gate of raids come in, you know, you're going to go.

467
00:28:13.68 --> 00:28:14.68
Yeah.

468
00:28:14.68 --> 00:28:16.68
You did take that radio back.

469
00:28:16.68 --> 00:28:21.68
I was, I was a chuckling inside when I saw that radio been placed back on top of my

470
00:28:21.68 --> 00:28:24.68
Ronin side, but just placed on the, yeah, you got it from here.

471
00:28:24.68 --> 00:28:25.68
Yeah, you put it back in.

472
00:28:25.68 --> 00:28:26.68
Thanks.

473
00:28:26.68 --> 00:28:27.68
And we'll be all good here.

474
00:28:27.68 --> 00:28:28.68
Awesome.

475
00:28:28.68 --> 00:28:31.68
Good times and the teams.

476
00:28:31.68 --> 00:28:35.68
And the last one here, he has integrity.

477
00:28:35.68 --> 00:28:39.68
If his interest in the good of the service is at all times greater than

478
00:28:39.68 --> 00:28:40.68
his personal pride.

479
00:28:40.68 --> 00:28:46.68
And when he holds himself to the same line of duty when unobserved as he would follow

480
00:28:46.68 --> 00:28:50.68
if all his superiors were present.

481
00:28:50.68 --> 00:28:51.68
This is the classic.

482
00:28:51.68 --> 00:28:54.68
What do you do when you're not people on a look at me?

483
00:28:54.68 --> 00:28:58.68
Here's another point.

484
00:28:58.68 --> 00:29:08.68
The cause of much of the friction in administrative machinery is that at all levels, there are individuals who insist on standing

485
00:29:08.68 --> 00:29:09.68
in their own light.

486
00:29:09.68 --> 00:29:12.68
Now, this is a term that I actually had to look up standing in your own light.

487
00:29:12.68 --> 00:29:13.68
It means getting your own way.

488
00:29:13.68 --> 00:29:17.68
It means you're preventing your, you're preventing your, you're preventing your own success.

489
00:29:17.68 --> 00:29:21.68
And he uses the term of lunch in here, standing in your own light.

490
00:29:21.68 --> 00:29:22.68
This is important.

491
00:29:22.68 --> 00:29:26.68
They believe that there is some special magic.

492
00:29:26.68 --> 00:29:28.68
Some quick springboard to success.

493
00:29:28.68 --> 00:29:37.68
They mistakenly think that it can be won by bootlicking, apple polishing, yesing higher

494
00:29:37.68 --> 00:29:44.68
authority, playing office politics, throwing weight around, ducking the issue, striving for cheap popularity,

495
00:29:44.68 --> 00:29:50.68
courting publicity, or seeking any and all means of grabbing the spotlight.

496
00:29:50.68 --> 00:29:51.68
So this is the guy.

497
00:29:51.68 --> 00:29:55.68
Everybody that's listening to this podcast right now knows who I'm talking about.

498
00:29:55.68 --> 00:30:02.68
That guy, that guy that's just always trying to kiss everyone's ass and make himself look good.

499
00:30:02.68 --> 00:30:05.68
And that's, you know, that's a shortcut, right?

500
00:30:05.68 --> 00:30:09.68
Marshall saying is a, is a shortcut or a springboard.

501
00:30:09.68 --> 00:30:12.68
You think it's a quick springboard.

502
00:30:12.68 --> 00:30:18.68
Back to the book, any one of this set of tricks may enable a man to carry the ball forward, a yard or two,

503
00:30:18.68 --> 00:30:21.68
in some special situation.

504
00:30:21.68 --> 00:30:27.68
But at least this comment can be made without qualification of the men who have risen to supreme heights in the fighting

505
00:30:27.68 --> 00:30:32.68
establishment of the United States and have had their greatness proclaimed by their fellow

506
00:30:32.68 --> 00:30:38.68
countrymen. There is not one career which provides any warrant for the conclusion that there is a special

507
00:30:38.68 --> 00:30:43.68
shortcut known only to this smart operators.

508
00:30:43.68 --> 00:30:50.68
Too enough, a few men have gained fairly high rank by dint of what late Mr. Justice Holmes called the

509
00:30:50.68 --> 00:30:56.68
instinct for the jugular, a feeling of wind to jump and wear to press and how to slash in order to achieve

510
00:30:56.68 --> 00:31:00.68
somewhat predatory personal ends.

511
00:31:00.68 --> 00:31:05.68
That will occasionally happen in any walk-a life. And I say this all the time, I've said this on this podcast.

512
00:31:05.68 --> 00:31:09.68
But if you got that guy that we're talking about, sometimes they're going to get a better recommendation.

513
00:31:09.68 --> 00:31:13.68
You, but sometimes they're going to get, they're going to get that promotion that you were wanting and you,

514
00:31:13.68 --> 00:31:17.68
you just, you just held the line and were a good person. That person took the credit for something and no one really

515
00:31:17.68 --> 00:31:19.68
realized next thing, you know, they get the promotion.

516
00:31:19.68 --> 00:31:25.68
But I agree with what's being said here, that does happen sometimes in every walk of life, but in the long run,

517
00:31:25.68 --> 00:31:27.68
that person's going down.

518
00:31:27.68 --> 00:31:32.68
That person's going down in the long run. And the more you kind of depend on that sort of thing,

519
00:31:32.68 --> 00:31:38.68
the less likely for any kind of success. And you absolutely, yeah, yeah.

520
00:31:38.68 --> 00:31:45.68
And he says here, but from Washington, Wayne and Jones down to Eisenhower, Van Degriff and

521
00:31:45.68 --> 00:31:52.68
Nimitz, the best, the men best loved by the American people for their military successes were also the men with

522
00:31:52.68 --> 00:31:59.68
greatness of soul.

523
00:31:59.68 --> 00:32:05.68
During World War II, there were quite a few higher commanders relieved in our forces, because

524
00:32:05.68 --> 00:32:10.68
it was judged for one reason or another that they had failed in battle. So relieved means you got fired.

525
00:32:10.68 --> 00:32:16.68
Of the total number, there were a few who took a reduction in rank, went willingly to a lower post

526
00:32:16.68 --> 00:32:23.68
in a fighting command. Other, no complaint kept their chins up, worked courageously and sympathetically with their commands,

527
00:32:23.68 --> 00:32:28.68
and provided an example of manhood that all who saw them will never forget.

528
00:32:28.68 --> 00:32:32.68
So if you get, I get asked this, I've got, I've got, been asked this a couple times. I got demoted.

529
00:32:32.68 --> 00:32:38.68
Or sometimes not demoted, but I got passed over, you know, someone else got promoted instead of me, what should I do?

530
00:32:38.68 --> 00:32:41.68
Get after it. That's what these guys did.

531
00:32:41.68 --> 00:32:44.68
That's what these guys did. Hey, screwed up. You know what? Check.

532
00:32:44.68 --> 00:32:49.68
All right, cool. Let's, let's, here's what I messed up. That was my fault. I'm ready to rock and roll. You put me down.

533
00:32:49.68 --> 00:32:53.68
Put me in charge of less people. I got it. I'm going to do well.

534
00:32:53.68 --> 00:32:59.68
Though their names need not be mentioned, they were imprinted with the real virtue of the services,

535
00:32:59.68 --> 00:33:03.68
even more deeply than many of their colleagues who had no blemishes on their records.

536
00:33:03.68 --> 00:33:06.68
Their character had met the ultimate test.

537
00:33:06.68 --> 00:33:12.68
The men who had the privilege of working close to them realized this and the supply,

538
00:33:12.68 --> 00:33:17.68
the supply, my effect of his personal influence helped strengthen the resolve of many others.

539
00:33:17.68 --> 00:33:21.68
So it's actually inspirational to people around you when they see that.

540
00:33:21.68 --> 00:33:27.68
And there's been many guys that I'm known that it bounced back for some kind of, from some kind of, you know, career problem.

541
00:33:27.68 --> 00:33:31.68
They mess something up. They got, they got fired.

542
00:33:31.68 --> 00:33:35.68
And they take it. They be humble about it. And they come back and turn it around.

543
00:33:35.68 --> 00:33:41.68
The person that complains and thinks that they're a victim, not going to work out for them.

544
00:33:41.68 --> 00:33:44.68
That's an, in the civilian sector and in the military sector.

545
00:33:44.68 --> 00:33:46.68
Now,

546
00:33:46.68 --> 00:33:50.68
Let's start talking a little bit about being a recruit.

547
00:33:50.68 --> 00:33:57.68
And the kind of the mental training, the mindset training that happens as a recruit to the book,

548
00:33:57.68 --> 00:34:00.68
his perseverance and the care of weapons,

549
00:34:00.68 --> 00:34:03.68
in keeping his living quarters orderly,

550
00:34:03.68 --> 00:34:07.68
and in doing his full share of work is best ensured,

551
00:34:07.68 --> 00:34:17.68
not through fear of punishments, but by stimulating his belief that any other way of going is unworthy of a member of a fighting service.

552
00:34:17.68 --> 00:34:28.68
Precision in personal habits, precision in drill and precision in daily living are the high road to that kind of discipline,

553
00:34:28.68 --> 00:34:36.68
which best ensures cool and collected thought and unity of action on the field of battle.

554
00:34:36.68 --> 00:34:41.68
I can tell you,

555
00:34:41.68 --> 00:34:43.68
Yeah,

556
00:34:43.68 --> 00:34:44.68
You know,

557
00:34:44.68 --> 00:34:49.68
it's just, it's basically he's talking about the, the unmedicated daily discipline and all things.

558
00:34:49.68 --> 00:34:50.68
That's what it is.

559
00:34:50.68 --> 00:34:55.68
And that ensures cool and collected thought and unity of action on the field of battle.

560
00:34:55.68 --> 00:34:57.68
Like I'm not going to say about that other than yes,

561
00:34:57.68 --> 00:34:59.68
Amen.

562
00:34:59.68 --> 00:35:03.68
Here's another little section.

563
00:35:03.68 --> 00:35:06.68
When men are well led,

564
00:35:06.68 --> 00:35:13.68
they become fully receptive to the whole body of ideas which their leaders see fit to put before them.

565
00:35:13.68 --> 00:35:15.68
Let's think about that.

566
00:35:15.68 --> 00:35:17.68
When men are well led,

567
00:35:17.68 --> 00:35:24.68
they become fully receptive to the whole body of ideas which their leaders see fit to put before them.

568
00:35:24.68 --> 00:35:28.68
So what we're talking about here is when somebody's a good leader,

569
00:35:28.68 --> 00:35:30.68
the the troopers around them,

570
00:35:30.68 --> 00:35:32.68
the people that are working for them,

571
00:35:32.68 --> 00:35:36.68
they start to believe the whole body everything,

572
00:35:36.68 --> 00:35:37.68
right?

573
00:35:37.68 --> 00:35:39.68
They start to believe everything that you're saying.

574
00:35:39.68 --> 00:35:41.68
And that's powerful.

575
00:35:41.68 --> 00:35:42.68
That's obviously powerful.

576
00:35:42.68 --> 00:35:46.68
Yeah, it kind of goes back to like what you're saying about like if you're,

577
00:35:46.68 --> 00:35:48.68
if they fear your punishment,

578
00:35:48.68 --> 00:35:49.68
that's how you lead you know,

579
00:35:49.68 --> 00:35:50.68
I'm just,

580
00:35:50.68 --> 00:35:51.68
and they fear the punishment.

581
00:35:51.68 --> 00:35:54.68
So they're going to do enough to not get punished,

582
00:35:54.68 --> 00:35:57.68
but they won't do anything that they don't have to.

583
00:35:57.68 --> 00:35:58.68
Yeah.

584
00:35:58.68 --> 00:36:00.68
So it's only what they have to do.

585
00:36:00.68 --> 00:36:02.68
So you won't get people doing their best.

586
00:36:02.68 --> 00:36:04.68
You know, I mean, so.

587
00:36:04.68 --> 00:36:05.68
Yeah.

588
00:36:05.68 --> 00:36:05.68
Yeah.

589
00:36:05.68 --> 00:36:08.68
And that that punishment piece that I kind of breathed through is,

590
00:36:08.68 --> 00:36:10.68
is not through fear of punishments,

591
00:36:10.68 --> 00:36:13.68
but by stimulating is belief that any other way.

592
00:36:13.68 --> 00:36:15.68
So that's 100% right.

593
00:36:15.68 --> 00:36:16.68
And we just, you know, I say at all time,

594
00:36:16.68 --> 00:36:17.68
if you,

595
00:36:17.68 --> 00:36:17.68
if you,

596
00:36:17.68 --> 00:36:17.68
if you're,

597
00:36:17.68 --> 00:36:19.68
if you're doing what you told them to do just because they're afraid of you,

598
00:36:19.68 --> 00:36:20.68
sure,

599
00:36:20.68 --> 00:36:21.68
you can get,

600
00:36:21.68 --> 00:36:22.68
that's going to work for a little while,

601
00:36:22.68 --> 00:36:22.68
you know,

602
00:36:22.68 --> 00:36:23.68
oh,

603
00:36:23.68 --> 00:36:23.68
I'll fire you.

604
00:36:23.68 --> 00:36:24.68
Okay.

605
00:36:24.68 --> 00:36:25.68
What's that person doing when we get to him,

606
00:36:25.68 --> 00:36:26.68
putting his,

607
00:36:26.68 --> 00:36:28.68
putting his resume on monster.com,

608
00:36:28.68 --> 00:36:29.68
looking for another job.

609
00:36:29.68 --> 00:36:30.68
So that's not to get fired.

610
00:36:30.68 --> 00:36:31.68
If you're not doing it,

611
00:36:31.68 --> 00:36:32.68
but that's not to get fired is,

612
00:36:32.68 --> 00:36:33.68
is.

613
00:36:34.68 --> 00:36:35.68
Alright.

614
00:36:35.68 --> 00:36:36.68
Going back to the book,

615
00:36:36.68 --> 00:36:37.68
Vowage has been said before,

616
00:36:37.68 --> 00:36:39.68
even so it can be said again.

617
00:36:39.68 --> 00:36:43.68
It is paramount and overriding responsibility of every officer to take care of his men before,

618
00:36:43.68 --> 00:36:45.68
caring for himself.

619
00:36:45.68 --> 00:36:50.68
Yet many junior officers do not seem to understand that steadfast,

620
00:36:50.68 --> 00:36:54.68
steadfast fidelity to it is required,

621
00:36:54.68 --> 00:36:56.68
not lip service.

622
00:36:56.68 --> 00:36:58.68
And of this,

623
00:36:58.68 --> 00:37:00.68
as Admiral Mahan would say,

624
00:37:00.68 --> 00:37:01.68
man would say,

625
00:37:01.68 --> 00:37:03.68
comes much evil.

626
00:37:03.68 --> 00:37:07.68
The loyalty of men simply cannot be commanded

627
00:37:07.68 --> 00:37:08.68
when they become

628
00:37:08.68 --> 00:37:12.68
in biddered by selfish action.

629
00:37:12.68 --> 00:37:13.68
So a minute,

630
00:37:13.68 --> 00:37:16.68
your troops see that you're being selfish,

631
00:37:16.68 --> 00:37:17.68
or you're doing this for yourself.

632
00:37:17.68 --> 00:37:19.68
That's the beginning of,

633
00:37:19.68 --> 00:37:20.68
but what he says,

634
00:37:20.68 --> 00:37:23.68
Admiral Mahan says much evil.

635
00:37:23.68 --> 00:37:25.68
He says evil comes from that.

636
00:37:25.68 --> 00:37:26.68
When you start acting selfishly as a leader,

637
00:37:26.68 --> 00:37:27.68
evil comes from that.

638
00:37:27.68 --> 00:37:29.68
If an officer is on a tour with an enlisted man,

639
00:37:29.68 --> 00:37:30.68
he takes care of the man,

640
00:37:30.68 --> 00:37:31.68
he takes care of the man,

641
00:37:31.68 --> 00:37:33.68
he takes care that the man is accommodated as to food,

642
00:37:33.68 --> 00:37:34.68
shelter medical treatment,

643
00:37:34.68 --> 00:37:38.68
or other prime needs before satisfying his own wants.

644
00:37:38.68 --> 00:37:40.68
If that means that the last meal,

645
00:37:40.68 --> 00:37:42.68
or the last bed is gone,

646
00:37:42.68 --> 00:37:44.68
his duty is to get along the hard way,

647
00:37:44.68 --> 00:37:46.68
boom.

648
00:37:46.68 --> 00:37:48.68
Take care of your people.

649
00:37:48.68 --> 00:38:02.68
Now, again, this is written in 1950,

650
00:38:02.68 --> 00:38:04.68
but even in 1950,

651
00:38:04.68 --> 00:38:06.68
you might think this is the hard post-war of the war.

652
00:38:06.68 --> 00:38:09.68
Two, chapter eight is actually called

653
00:38:09.68 --> 00:38:12.68
getting along with people.

654
00:38:12.68 --> 00:38:13.68
Boom.

655
00:38:13.68 --> 00:38:15.68
Now, here's a real,

656
00:38:15.68 --> 00:38:17.68
some of this stuff is so simple.

657
00:38:17.68 --> 00:38:18.68
So obvious.

658
00:38:18.68 --> 00:38:21.68
It's so simple and so obvious that they had to write a book about it,

659
00:38:21.68 --> 00:38:23.68
so that people could do it because we all failed to do it.

660
00:38:23.68 --> 00:38:24.68
So here we go.

661
00:38:24.68 --> 00:38:26.68
If you like people,

662
00:38:26.68 --> 00:38:30.68
if you seek contact with them rather than hiding yourself in a corner,

663
00:38:30.68 --> 00:38:33.68
if you study your fellow men sympathetically,

664
00:38:33.68 --> 00:38:39.68
if you try consistently to contribute to something to this success and happiness,

665
00:38:39.68 --> 00:38:42.68
or contribute something to their success and happiness,

666
00:38:42.68 --> 00:38:46.68
if you are reasonably generous with your thoughts and your time,

667
00:38:46.68 --> 00:38:50.68
if you have a partial reserve with everyone,

668
00:38:50.68 --> 00:38:54.68
but a seeming reserve with no one.

669
00:38:54.68 --> 00:39:00.68
If you work to be interesting rather than spend to be a good fellow,

670
00:39:00.68 --> 00:39:02.68
you will get along with your sub-erears,

671
00:39:02.68 --> 00:39:03.68
your sub-ordinates,

672
00:39:03.68 --> 00:39:05.68
your orderly, your roommate,

673
00:39:05.68 --> 00:39:07.68
and the human race.

674
00:39:07.68 --> 00:39:08.68
That's it.

675
00:39:08.68 --> 00:39:09.68
That's all you got.

676
00:39:09.68 --> 00:39:10.68
If you want to get along with everybody,

677
00:39:10.68 --> 00:39:12.68
now one of the ones that I,

678
00:39:12.68 --> 00:39:13.68
you know,

679
00:39:13.68 --> 00:39:14.68
these are all pretty obvious,

680
00:39:14.68 --> 00:39:15.68
but one of the ones,

681
00:39:15.68 --> 00:39:18.68
if you have a partial reserve with everyone,

682
00:39:18.68 --> 00:39:21.68
but a seeming reserve with no one.

683
00:39:21.68 --> 00:39:24.68
So what that means is you're not just flying off the handle.

684
00:39:24.68 --> 00:39:26.68
You're just reserved a little bit.

685
00:39:26.68 --> 00:39:28.68
You're just, you show restraint,

686
00:39:28.68 --> 00:39:31.68
but the restraint doesn't come across as a loophonist,

687
00:39:31.68 --> 00:39:32.68
right?

688
00:39:32.68 --> 00:39:33.68
It's not so much,

689
00:39:33.68 --> 00:39:33.68
you know,

690
00:39:33.68 --> 00:39:34.68
if I come into a room,

691
00:39:34.68 --> 00:39:35.68
and I'm going to show restraint,

692
00:39:35.68 --> 00:39:37.68
so I'm not going to say hi to you,

693
00:39:37.68 --> 00:39:40.68
I'm going to come across as a loof and you're not going to like me.

694
00:39:40.68 --> 00:39:41.68
But if I,

695
00:39:41.68 --> 00:39:44.68
but if I was a walkin' to go echo my brother, give me a hug.

696
00:39:44.68 --> 00:39:46.68
Well, you're not going to like me either.

697
00:39:46.68 --> 00:39:47.68
Well I,

698
00:39:47.68 --> 00:39:47.68
well I,

699
00:39:47.68 --> 00:39:49.68
well you're one of the few people.

700
00:39:49.68 --> 00:39:50.68
Well that's the Hawaiian in you.

701
00:39:50.68 --> 00:39:51.68
A lohospiro.

702
00:39:51.68 --> 00:39:52.68
Let's hear it.

703
00:39:52.68 --> 00:39:53.68
You know?

704
00:39:53.68 --> 00:39:54.68
So,

705
00:39:54.68 --> 00:39:55.68
so it's,

706
00:39:55.68 --> 00:39:58.68
it's that measured reserve that measure restraint,

707
00:39:58.68 --> 00:40:00.68
that balance is a little bit back out of me there.

708
00:40:00.68 --> 00:40:01.68
So I gotta find the good,

709
00:40:01.68 --> 00:40:03.68
good spot in the middle.

710
00:40:03.68 --> 00:40:05.68
Again,

711
00:40:05.68 --> 00:40:07.68
getting along with people,

712
00:40:07.68 --> 00:40:08.68
back to the book,

713
00:40:08.68 --> 00:40:13.84
scores of thousands, precepts, and platitudes have been written for the guidance of personal

714
00:40:13.84 --> 00:40:15.92
conduct.

715
00:40:15.92 --> 00:40:21.64
The odd part is that, despite all of this labor, most of the frictions in modern society

716
00:40:21.64 --> 00:40:25.96
arise from the individuals feeling of inferiority.

717
00:40:25.96 --> 00:40:34.32
His false pride, his vanity, his unwillingness to yield space to any other man.

718
00:40:34.32 --> 00:40:36.44
Unwillingness to yield space to any of them.

719
00:40:36.44 --> 00:40:41.84
And I get hit on this one a lot because, again, because of my personality can be a little

720
00:40:41.84 --> 00:40:43.000
bit forceful.

721
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.56
People think I'm just no compromise.

722
00:40:45.56 --> 00:40:47.16
My way or the highway.

723
00:40:47.16 --> 00:40:48.40
And this is what they're talking about.

724
00:40:48.40 --> 00:40:49.72
I'm not like that.

725
00:40:49.72 --> 00:40:51.80
I'm open to suggestions.

726
00:40:51.80 --> 00:40:53.84
I'm willing to say, you know what, that's a better idea.

727
00:40:53.84 --> 00:40:54.84
Or you know what?

728
00:40:54.84 --> 00:40:55.84
I like your idea.

729
00:40:55.84 --> 00:40:57.04
Could we make this adjustment to it?

730
00:40:57.04 --> 00:41:01.24
Or yes, I can change my idea to fit with what you're saying, because it makes sense.

731
00:41:01.24 --> 00:41:05.12
People that don't do that have unwillingness to yield space to any other man.

732
00:41:05.12 --> 00:41:13.16
And continuing on and his consequent urge to throw his own weight around.

733
00:41:13.16 --> 00:41:14.32
Right?

734
00:41:14.32 --> 00:41:17.56
These are just ways to not get along with people and speaking of ways to get not

735
00:41:17.56 --> 00:41:18.88
get along with people.

736
00:41:18.88 --> 00:41:21.56
Here's the 13 mistakes.

737
00:41:21.56 --> 00:41:23.04
The 13 mistakes.

738
00:41:23.04 --> 00:41:27.64
This is from the United States Coast Guard magazine.

739
00:41:27.64 --> 00:41:28.64
13 pitfalls.

740
00:41:28.64 --> 00:41:29.64
Here we go.

741
00:41:29.64 --> 00:41:35.000
One to attempt to set up your own personal, to attempt to set up your own standard of

742
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.76
right and wrong.

743
00:41:37.76 --> 00:41:46.16
To try to measure the enjoyment of others by your own, to expect uniformity of opinions in

744
00:41:46.16 --> 00:41:51.20
the world, to fail to make allowance for inexperience.

745
00:41:51.20 --> 00:41:53.12
It's a good one.

746
00:41:53.12 --> 00:42:02.32
To endeavor to mold all dispositions alike, not to yield on an important trifles, same

747
00:42:02.32 --> 00:42:03.32
thing we just heard.

748
00:42:03.32 --> 00:42:08.16
The things that don't matter who cares, let the guys do what they're going to do on

749
00:42:08.16 --> 00:42:10.32
that.

750
00:42:10.32 --> 00:42:14.16
To look for perfection in our own actions.

751
00:42:14.16 --> 00:42:19.88
To worry ourselves and others about what can't be remedied.

752
00:42:19.88 --> 00:42:22.28
Why you worried about that can't change it?

753
00:42:22.28 --> 00:42:23.68
Let's not worry about it.

754
00:42:23.68 --> 00:42:27.16
Let's just move on.

755
00:42:27.16 --> 00:42:33.76
Here's a big one, not to help everybody, wherever, however, whenever we can.

756
00:42:33.76 --> 00:42:34.76
That's a big ask.

757
00:42:34.76 --> 00:42:36.40
That's a big request.

758
00:42:36.40 --> 00:42:38.84
Now, you know what I want you to do in your life?

759
00:42:38.84 --> 00:42:43.24
Help everybody, however, wherever and whenever you can.

760
00:42:43.24 --> 00:42:44.24
That's asking a lot.

761
00:42:44.24 --> 00:42:47.56
That's a big one.

762
00:42:47.56 --> 00:42:51.48
To consider impossible what we cannot ourselves perform.

763
00:42:51.48 --> 00:42:54.40
I can't even do that.

764
00:42:54.40 --> 00:43:00.64
To believe only what our finite minds can grasp.

765
00:43:00.64 --> 00:43:06.36
Must say that one again, to believe only what our finite minds can grasp.

766
00:43:06.36 --> 00:43:07.88
That's humility.

767
00:43:07.88 --> 00:43:11.28
To recognize that you don't understand everything in the world.

768
00:43:11.28 --> 00:43:13.92
I don't understand everything in the world.

769
00:43:13.92 --> 00:43:15.80
It's okay.

770
00:43:15.80 --> 00:43:17.60
There's things beyond my comprehension.

771
00:43:17.60 --> 00:43:18.80
That's okay.

772
00:43:18.80 --> 00:43:21.88
You got to admit to that.

773
00:43:21.88 --> 00:43:27.88
You got to make allowances for the weaknesses of others.

774
00:43:27.88 --> 00:43:38.28
To estimate by some outside quality when it is that within, which makes the man.

775
00:43:38.28 --> 00:43:41.48
So, very simple.

776
00:43:41.48 --> 00:43:48.000
Interesting how you can make allowances for our according to the 13 things.

777
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.68
You can make allowances for inexperience.

778
00:43:50.68 --> 00:43:52.96
But not the weakness of others.

779
00:43:52.96 --> 00:43:56.16
No, it says not to make.

780
00:43:56.16 --> 00:43:57.16
This would be a mistake.

781
00:43:57.16 --> 00:44:00.08
It would be a mistake not to make allowances for the weaknesses of others.

782
00:44:00.08 --> 00:44:01.60
Also, he said, okay, next to like.

783
00:44:01.60 --> 00:44:06.80
You got to just say, this guy's, you know, I got to make allowances.

784
00:44:06.80 --> 00:44:07.80
Flex a little bit.

785
00:44:07.80 --> 00:44:14.04
He's got to fight off the handle.

786
00:44:14.04 --> 00:44:15.04
Back to the book.

787
00:44:15.04 --> 00:44:21.96
I used to say that when any officer has the inexcusable fault that he takes snap judgment

788
00:44:21.96 --> 00:44:28.16
on his own men, he will not be any different in his relations with all other people.

789
00:44:28.16 --> 00:44:31.36
And we'll stand in his own light for the duration of his career again.

790
00:44:31.36 --> 00:44:32.48
There's that term.

791
00:44:32.48 --> 00:44:40.56
If you're making snap judgments of people, you're not going to do them justice.

792
00:44:40.56 --> 00:44:43.72
And that's something that I always very careful about because I've talked about it before

793
00:44:43.72 --> 00:44:44.96
in the SEAL teams.

794
00:44:44.96 --> 00:44:47.84
Your reputation is very, very important.

795
00:44:47.84 --> 00:44:53.16
And everybody that's done something stupid in the SEAL teams, every single person knows it.

796
00:44:53.16 --> 00:44:59.04
I mean, at a high level of stupidity, if you do something really stupid, everybody knows

797
00:44:59.04 --> 00:45:00.04
about it.

798
00:45:00.04 --> 00:45:02.88
And then minor stupid things, a lot of people will know about it.

799
00:45:02.88 --> 00:45:06.12
And so you develop a reputation over time.

800
00:45:06.12 --> 00:45:11.88
And it's very easy to fall in that category of all iron disguise, you know, kind of a

801
00:45:11.88 --> 00:45:15.08
turd or whatever, and not give them a chance.

802
00:45:15.08 --> 00:45:18.12
But I always, I always try to give people a chance and say, okay, let me see what this

803
00:45:18.12 --> 00:45:19.60
guy's really like.

804
00:45:19.60 --> 00:45:21.88
And I guess I would take a little personal challenge if it was a guy that was going

805
00:45:21.88 --> 00:45:24.04
to be working for me.

806
00:45:24.04 --> 00:45:25.80
Let's see if I can make this guy rock and roll.

807
00:45:25.80 --> 00:45:30.000
You know, let me see if I can make this guy into a solid seal.

808
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Can't always pull it off.

809
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.16
But sometimes you can't just need that second chance.

810
00:45:35.16 --> 00:45:38.72
Some people go too far with the mistakes that they made, don't they don't get a second

811
00:45:38.72 --> 00:45:41.72
chance?

812
00:45:41.72 --> 00:45:43.56
Okay, we've talked about this before.

813
00:45:43.56 --> 00:45:45.04
Let's talk about it again.

814
00:45:45.04 --> 00:45:46.04
Here we go.

815
00:45:46.04 --> 00:45:51.72
The man who will not listen never develops whits enough to distinguish between a bore and

816
00:45:51.72 --> 00:45:56.68
a sage and therefore cannot pick the best company.

817
00:45:56.68 --> 00:46:03.16
The vacant stare, the drifting of eyes from the speaker to a window or a picture or a passing

818
00:46:03.16 --> 00:46:10.64
blonde, though greatly tempting in the midst of long discourse are taken only as signs of

819
00:46:10.64 --> 00:46:12.96
inattention.

820
00:46:12.96 --> 00:46:17.28
Many young officer called to the carpet for some trivial business as managed to square

821
00:46:17.28 --> 00:46:22.04
himself with his commander just by looking straight and talking straight in the few moments

822
00:46:22.04 --> 00:46:24.40
that decided his future.

823
00:46:24.40 --> 00:46:27.60
So I guess this might be something that didn't make the politically correct version.

824
00:46:27.60 --> 00:46:31.96
If your eyes are wandering on a passing blonde, why do I have this conversation?

825
00:46:31.96 --> 00:46:37.000
So that might be one of those things where they changed that for the 2007 edition.

826
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Like what?

827
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Like that's show, show vines.

828
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.84
It's a good show vines, stick.

829
00:46:41.84 --> 00:46:43.64
It's a blonde, it didn't say girl.

830
00:46:43.64 --> 00:46:47.52
Okay, well maybe good point, maybe it's like racial.

831
00:46:47.52 --> 00:46:49.52
Anti brown hair to people.

832
00:46:49.52 --> 00:46:50.52
Yeah, yeah.

833
00:46:50.52 --> 00:46:53.36
Too bad.

834
00:46:53.36 --> 00:46:54.72
And this is important, though.

835
00:46:54.72 --> 00:46:57.80
You go into talking to your in trouble.

836
00:46:57.80 --> 00:47:01.16
You get there, look straight and talk straight for a few minutes with the boss.

837
00:47:01.16 --> 00:47:02.44
Hey, this boss is what happened.

838
00:47:02.44 --> 00:47:04.56
This is what I did, this is mistakes I made.

839
00:47:04.56 --> 00:47:09.68
That's got infinitely better chance of you recovering from that situation as when you

840
00:47:09.68 --> 00:47:10.68
go in there.

841
00:47:10.68 --> 00:47:13.08
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

842
00:47:13.08 --> 00:47:14.16
Don't be that guy.

843
00:47:14.16 --> 00:47:17.92
Don't be that guy.

844
00:47:17.92 --> 00:47:22.56
Elsewhere in the book, a great deal has been said about the importance of the voice and

845
00:47:22.56 --> 00:47:25.76
of developing ones, powers of conversation.

846
00:47:25.76 --> 00:47:31.60
Not a great deal needs to be added there, but there's no excuse for the officer who talks

847
00:47:31.60 --> 00:47:35.52
so that others must strain to hear what he is saying.

848
00:47:35.52 --> 00:47:40.52
Unless he is suffering from Laryn Jydus, it is simple enough to keep the chin up and let

849
00:47:40.52 --> 00:47:42.56
the words roll out.

850
00:47:42.56 --> 00:47:47.80
Many persons have the bad habit of letting the voice drop at the end of a sentence.

851
00:47:47.80 --> 00:47:54.80
The effect on the other party is like watching a man run away from a fight.

852
00:47:54.80 --> 00:47:57.84
Notice I said fight really loud because I didn't want to be the guy that was dropping

853
00:47:57.84 --> 00:47:58.84
off on the end of a sentence.

854
00:47:58.84 --> 00:47:59.84
Right.

855
00:47:59.84 --> 00:48:05.24
What about speaking and how you speak and speaking clearly and not mumbling and not fading

856
00:48:05.24 --> 00:48:08.68
off on the end of your words?

857
00:48:08.68 --> 00:48:12.48
This thing is a gold-minded book actually.

858
00:48:12.48 --> 00:48:16.92
This should be issued to 13 year olds nationwide in my opinion.

859
00:48:16.92 --> 00:48:20.84
Maybe we could start a campaign to make that happen.

860
00:48:20.84 --> 00:48:21.84
Good.

861
00:48:21.84 --> 00:48:23.20
Back to the book.

862
00:48:23.20 --> 00:48:27.76
Carefulness in the little things count much.

863
00:48:27.76 --> 00:48:31.92
And develop an aversion to the individual who cannot remember their names.

864
00:48:31.92 --> 00:48:33.96
Their titles or their stations.

865
00:48:33.96 --> 00:48:39.28
But they will warm to the person who remembers and they will overlook most of his other

866
00:48:39.28 --> 00:48:41.28
shortcomings.

867
00:48:41.28 --> 00:48:46.56
Likewise, they are won by any words of appreciation or of interest in what they're doing.

868
00:48:46.56 --> 00:48:49.84
So again, how we get along with other people?

869
00:48:49.84 --> 00:48:50.84
Remember their name.

870
00:48:50.84 --> 00:48:52.52
I know about it and that's hard.

871
00:48:52.52 --> 00:48:54.44
You know, that's hard.

872
00:48:54.44 --> 00:48:55.44
There's tricks for that.

873
00:48:55.44 --> 00:48:56.44
Yeah.

874
00:48:56.44 --> 00:48:58.000
See, you need tricks for it even.

875
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.68
I mean, I'm nothing everyone needs, but I'm just saying it.

876
00:49:01.68 --> 00:49:03.68
It's understood that that's hard.

877
00:49:03.68 --> 00:49:07.68
And there's tricks out there because people know that that can be hard.

878
00:49:07.68 --> 00:49:09.08
And they also know that it's impactful.

879
00:49:09.08 --> 00:49:10.08
Yeah.

880
00:49:10.08 --> 00:49:11.08
It's impactful.

881
00:49:11.08 --> 00:49:12.08
Hammer.

882
00:49:12.08 --> 00:49:15.28
But you forget a guy's name literally two seconds after each of us.

883
00:49:15.28 --> 00:49:19.000
Unless you make it a point to command yourself to remember it.

884
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Right.

885
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000
That's tricky.

886
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Yeah.

887
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000
It's tricky.

888
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.76
I knew a guy that was a really good leader.

889
00:49:25.76 --> 00:49:28.88
And he would go into a room of 25 people.

890
00:49:28.88 --> 00:49:31.000
And he would go over the top.

891
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.04
And when he got done, he would say, I know all your names now.

892
00:49:34.04 --> 00:49:35.04
Yeah.

893
00:49:35.04 --> 00:49:36.04
You go name every single one of them.

894
00:49:36.04 --> 00:49:37.04
Yeah, Henry does that sometimes.

895
00:49:37.04 --> 00:49:38.04
It's pretty interesting.

896
00:49:38.04 --> 00:49:39.04
Yeah.

897
00:49:39.04 --> 00:49:40.04
That's legit.

898
00:49:40.04 --> 00:49:41.84
I bet Henry's got some little trick to do it.

899
00:49:41.84 --> 00:49:42.84
Yeah.

900
00:49:42.84 --> 00:49:45.48
You remember, you know, your name is Echo.

901
00:49:45.48 --> 00:49:46.48
Cool.

902
00:49:46.48 --> 00:49:48.52
I look at you and I see big E on your face.

903
00:49:48.52 --> 00:49:49.52
Right.

904
00:49:49.52 --> 00:49:50.52
Right.

905
00:49:50.52 --> 00:49:51.52
Now I'm amazing.

906
00:49:51.52 --> 00:49:52.52
Yeah.

907
00:49:52.52 --> 00:49:53.52
Yeah.

908
00:49:53.52 --> 00:49:54.52
That's interesting.

909
00:49:54.52 --> 00:49:56.32
I want to remember one guy.

910
00:49:56.32 --> 00:49:58.68
I'm going to make it a point to remember this guy's name.

911
00:49:58.68 --> 00:49:59.96
He'll be like, hey, my name's John.

912
00:49:59.96 --> 00:50:04.000
You'd be like, hey, Josh, but you'll forget it quick sometimes.

913
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.56
It's weird, man.

914
00:50:05.56 --> 00:50:06.56
Not good.

915
00:50:06.56 --> 00:50:07.56
Got to remember those names.

916
00:50:07.56 --> 00:50:08.56
Got to lock them in.

917
00:50:08.56 --> 00:50:11.32
I think if you take a certain amount of pride in doing that,

918
00:50:11.32 --> 00:50:12.32
I think that helps a lot.

919
00:50:12.32 --> 00:50:13.32
Step number one.

920
00:50:13.32 --> 00:50:14.32
Yeah.

921
00:50:14.32 --> 00:50:15.52
Take pride in your job.

922
00:50:15.52 --> 00:50:16.52
Okay.

923
00:50:16.52 --> 00:50:17.52
I'm going to try that.

924
00:50:17.52 --> 00:50:18.52
Now this is interesting.

925
00:50:18.52 --> 00:50:20.52
A little dig here.

926
00:50:20.52 --> 00:50:23.16
It's actually kind of funny.

927
00:50:23.16 --> 00:50:26.36
He's basically going back and saying that all this information about getting along

928
00:50:26.36 --> 00:50:27.36
with other people.

929
00:50:27.36 --> 00:50:31.40
He's saying he's kind of recapping the whole thing to close it out.

930
00:50:31.40 --> 00:50:32.40
Back to the book.

931
00:50:32.40 --> 00:50:34.84
It isn't lengthy advice which is needed on this subject.

932
00:50:34.84 --> 00:50:39.28
Since a man commissioned is considered to have graduated from at least the kindergarten

933
00:50:39.28 --> 00:50:41.08
of good manners.

934
00:50:41.08 --> 00:50:47.000
What counts is simply caring about it and not to be ingratiating to other people,

935
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.64
but for the sake of one's own dignity and self-respect.

936
00:50:51.64 --> 00:50:56.60
One of the oracles on winning friends and influencing people have said it in those

937
00:50:56.60 --> 00:50:57.88
few words.

938
00:50:57.88 --> 00:51:01.36
And if they had, there would have been no books to sell.

939
00:51:01.36 --> 00:51:07.40
So there's a little shot, little shot on winning friends and influencing people.

940
00:51:07.40 --> 00:51:09.04
Wait, when was that one right then?

941
00:51:09.04 --> 00:51:10.04
Oh, that was written.

942
00:51:10.04 --> 00:51:12.28
I don't know where the date dates, but that's written a long time ago.

943
00:51:12.28 --> 00:51:13.28
Dang.

944
00:51:13.28 --> 00:51:14.28
Yeah.

945
00:51:14.28 --> 00:51:15.28
Some of you have time to read that.

946
00:51:15.28 --> 00:51:16.28
No, that's turn of the century.

947
00:51:16.28 --> 00:51:17.28
Fold school.

948
00:51:17.28 --> 00:51:18.28
Yeah.

949
00:51:18.28 --> 00:51:20.28
Old school.

950
00:51:20.28 --> 00:51:24.68
Talking about, no, we're going to leader leaders and leadership.

951
00:51:24.68 --> 00:51:27.72
And what type of men are leaders?

952
00:51:27.72 --> 00:51:32.40
Those who come forward to fill these same places and to command them with equal or greater

953
00:51:32.40 --> 00:51:36.04
authority and competence will not be plastered saints.

954
00:51:36.04 --> 00:51:40.28
So if you remember in the beginning, he goes on this thing about how you're not going

955
00:51:40.28 --> 00:51:43.16
to swear and you're going to be not going to talk about women.

956
00:51:43.16 --> 00:51:45.80
He's given some leeway now to that.

957
00:51:45.80 --> 00:51:51.48
Saying they're not going to be plastered saints laden with all human virtue, spotless and

958
00:51:51.48 --> 00:51:59.40
character and fit to be anointed with a Superman legend by some future person weems.

959
00:51:59.40 --> 00:52:05.32
They will be men with a human quality and a strong belief in the United States and the goodness

960
00:52:05.32 --> 00:52:08.76
of a free society.

961
00:52:08.76 --> 00:52:14.64
They will have some of the average man's faults and maybe a few of his vices.

962
00:52:14.64 --> 00:52:20.76
But certainly they will possess the qualities of courage, creative intelligence and physical

963
00:52:20.76 --> 00:52:27.20
fitness in more than average measure.

964
00:52:27.20 --> 00:52:32.40
So again, it's not quite as strict as he laid out in the beginning.

965
00:52:32.40 --> 00:52:36.84
Yeah, because it's like, remember I'm trying, you watch training day?

966
00:52:36.84 --> 00:52:39.28
Remember that Denzel and I saw a part of it.

967
00:52:39.28 --> 00:52:44.60
Yeah, so there's a little concept is in there where he said, you got to have a

968
00:52:44.60 --> 00:52:47.80
little dirt on you so they can trust you.

969
00:52:47.80 --> 00:52:48.80
Okay.

970
00:52:48.80 --> 00:52:53.64
So basically, if you speak clean, well, yeah, there's all kinds of heroes that are not

971
00:52:53.64 --> 00:52:54.64
squeaky clean.

972
00:52:54.64 --> 00:52:58.04
Well, in all kinds of leaders that Denzel, I would say there's more heroes that aren't

973
00:52:58.04 --> 00:52:59.04
squeaky clean.

974
00:52:59.04 --> 00:53:02.32
Yeah, there are real purpose plenty of leaders that aren't squeaky clean and they're

975
00:53:02.32 --> 00:53:03.32
great leaders.

976
00:53:03.32 --> 00:53:04.32
Yeah.

977
00:53:04.32 --> 00:53:06.16
And that's what they're given that up in this book.

978
00:53:06.16 --> 00:53:08.32
It's saying look, not going to be a plaster saint.

979
00:53:08.32 --> 00:53:09.32
It'll be a person.

980
00:53:09.32 --> 00:53:10.32
Gonna have faults.

981
00:53:10.32 --> 00:53:12.92
But if we can say, gonna have vices, gonna have dirt.

982
00:53:12.92 --> 00:53:13.92
Yeah.

983
00:53:13.92 --> 00:53:17.76
For the record, the training day guys were all cropped.

984
00:53:17.76 --> 00:53:19.96
That's a little bit of an experience.

985
00:53:19.96 --> 00:53:20.96
Yeah.

986
00:53:20.96 --> 00:53:22.76
They had a little too much dirt.

987
00:53:22.76 --> 00:53:23.76
Yeah, exactly.

988
00:53:23.76 --> 00:53:29.20
All right, so now we're talking about Grant, General Grant, Civil War General, and

989
00:53:29.20 --> 00:53:32.64
beset by human failings.

990
00:53:32.64 --> 00:53:34.84
He could not look impressive.

991
00:53:34.84 --> 00:53:39.72
Average though he wasn't many things, there was nothing average about the strong

992
00:53:39.72 --> 00:53:45.64
way in which he took hold, applying massive common sense to the complex problems of the

993
00:53:45.64 --> 00:53:47.48
field.

994
00:53:47.48 --> 00:53:50.24
That is why he is worth close regard.

995
00:53:50.24 --> 00:53:56.68
His virtues as a military leader were of the simpler sort, which plain men may understand

996
00:53:56.68 --> 00:53:58.36
and hope to emulate.

997
00:53:58.36 --> 00:54:00.40
He was direct in manner.

998
00:54:00.40 --> 00:54:01.96
He never intrigued.

999
00:54:01.96 --> 00:54:03.52
His speech was homely.

1000
00:54:03.52 --> 00:54:04.92
He was approachable.

1001
00:54:04.92 --> 00:54:07.84
His mind never deviated from the object.

1002
00:54:07.84 --> 00:54:13.48
Though a stubborn man, he was always willing to listen to his subordinates.

1003
00:54:13.48 --> 00:54:14.84
And I love this one right here.

1004
00:54:14.84 --> 00:54:18.40
He never adhered to a plan, obsnitely.

1005
00:54:18.40 --> 00:54:23.20
But nothing could induce him to forsake the idea behind the plan.

1006
00:54:23.20 --> 00:54:25.24
So look, I'm not going to say, here's my idea.

1007
00:54:25.24 --> 00:54:27.68
And I'm going to hold that idea because it's good.

1008
00:54:27.68 --> 00:54:30.16
But the plan that's going to get us there, I'm not going to have to worry about that.

1009
00:54:30.16 --> 00:54:32.32
I'm not going to hold onto that.

1010
00:54:32.32 --> 00:54:35.88
And let it drag me into the ground.

1011
00:54:35.88 --> 00:54:45.08
Back to the book in the military services, though there are niches for the pad down.

1012
00:54:45.08 --> 00:54:50.12
Character is at all times at least as vital as intellect.

1013
00:54:50.12 --> 00:54:58.58
So padant is like overly educated types in area where you get padented, right?

1014
00:54:58.58 --> 00:55:05.86
And the main rewards go to him who can make other men feel toughened as well as elevated.

1015
00:55:05.86 --> 00:55:09.70
Here's some trade tier, quiet resolution.

1016
00:55:09.70 --> 00:55:12.18
The hardyhood to take risks.

1017
00:55:12.18 --> 00:55:18.30
The will to take full responsibility for decisions.

1018
00:55:18.30 --> 00:55:22.42
The readiness to share its rewards with subordinates.

1019
00:55:22.42 --> 00:55:26.94
This is obviously extreme ownership and part of extreme ownership is when you something

1020
00:55:26.94 --> 00:55:28.98
goes well, you don't own that part.

1021
00:55:28.98 --> 00:55:31.78
You give that away.

1022
00:55:31.78 --> 00:55:38.38
And the key thing is to take the blame when things go adversely boom.

1023
00:55:38.38 --> 00:55:45.94
The nerve to survive storm and disappointment and to face towards each new day with the

1024
00:55:45.94 --> 00:55:48.70
score sheet wiped clean.

1025
00:55:48.70 --> 00:55:56.50
Neither dwelling on one successes nor accepting discouragement from one's failures.

1026
00:55:56.50 --> 00:55:58.70
Like I said, this book should be issued to 13 year olds.

1027
00:55:58.70 --> 00:56:00.90
Yeah, that was a really good book.

1028
00:56:00.90 --> 00:56:05.54
I figured you dig this one.

1029
00:56:05.54 --> 00:56:07.74
I used a lot of highlight around this one.

1030
00:56:07.74 --> 00:56:09.34
I've had this book for a long time.

1031
00:56:09.34 --> 00:56:10.62
I couldn't, it's funny.

1032
00:56:10.62 --> 00:56:14.70
When I read it this time, I hadn't read it in so long that it was almost like I was reading

1033
00:56:14.70 --> 00:56:15.70
it again.

1034
00:56:15.70 --> 00:56:18.02
I pretty much it forgot most of it.

1035
00:56:18.02 --> 00:56:23.70
And a lot of it, I subconsciously, we've been probably part of my game for a long time.

1036
00:56:23.70 --> 00:56:25.14
I can't tell, though.

1037
00:56:25.14 --> 00:56:31.62
I can't tell what I just, what I buried and what was a seed that grew.

1038
00:56:31.62 --> 00:56:34.74
Probably there's some ideas in here that were seeds of my thought.

1039
00:56:34.74 --> 00:56:37.70
Yeah, I would imagine so that that's not the kind of book where it's like, oh yeah,

1040
00:56:37.70 --> 00:56:39.42
let me memorize all this.

1041
00:56:39.42 --> 00:56:40.70
It's more like, oh, shoot, I got it.

1042
00:56:40.70 --> 00:56:42.98
I got it kind of in Jess.

1043
00:56:42.98 --> 00:56:45.90
Yes, and here's the straight-up truth.

1044
00:56:45.90 --> 00:56:49.58
When somebody gave me this book, I probably read 10 pages of it and said, oh, this is pretty

1045
00:56:49.58 --> 00:56:50.58
cool.

1046
00:56:50.58 --> 00:56:53.94
Put it in my locker and then went out and worked out and forgot about it for the next 15

1047
00:56:53.94 --> 00:56:54.94
years.

1048
00:56:54.94 --> 00:57:04.22
So it's not, I didn't, you know, this current jacco will call it where I kind of overlay

1049
00:57:04.22 --> 00:57:08.94
and bring in, it's like a jiu-jitsu when you're going to jiu-jitsu.

1050
00:57:08.94 --> 00:57:13.70
If you're a brown belt, I'm purple, the black belt and jiu-jitsu.

1051
00:57:13.70 --> 00:57:17.02
Somebody can show you a move and you can assimilate it really quickly and you go, oh yeah,

1052
00:57:17.02 --> 00:57:18.86
I need to do this.

1053
00:57:18.86 --> 00:57:22.70
Well, I was a white belt before in this stuff.

1054
00:57:22.70 --> 00:57:27.66
So when I'd read it, it kind of made sense, but it was, it was didn't make as much

1055
00:57:27.66 --> 00:57:32.50
sense as that when I read this stuff now, it's like I totally understand it at a deeper

1056
00:57:32.50 --> 00:57:33.50
level.

1057
00:57:33.50 --> 00:57:41.06
And so it's way more impactful for me.

1058
00:57:41.06 --> 00:57:44.62
People always ask me about this one as well, back to the book, to speak of the importance

1059
00:57:44.62 --> 00:57:49.10
of a sense of humor would be unavailing.

1060
00:57:49.10 --> 00:57:55.90
If it were not that what cramped so many men isn't that they are by nature humorless,

1061
00:57:55.90 --> 00:58:02.78
but that they are hesitant to exercise what humor they possess.

1062
00:58:02.78 --> 00:58:07.82
Within the military profession, it is as unwise to let the muscles go soft and to spare

1063
00:58:07.82 --> 00:58:11.74
the mind, the strain of original thinking.

1064
00:58:11.74 --> 00:58:15.50
Great humor has always been in the military tradition.

1065
00:58:15.50 --> 00:58:18.34
People ask, for some reason people ask me about humor a lot.

1066
00:58:18.34 --> 00:58:22.02
It's not good for an author, or it's not good for a leader to tell to.

1067
00:58:22.02 --> 00:58:23.02
And yes, it is.

1068
00:58:23.02 --> 00:58:26.66
And that's why I always, whenever there's something funny in the war books that we read,

1069
00:58:26.66 --> 00:58:28.70
I always try and capture that.

1070
00:58:28.70 --> 00:58:32.22
So then people realize that these guys are out there and they keep that sense of humor going

1071
00:58:32.22 --> 00:58:33.22
all the time.

1072
00:58:33.22 --> 00:58:34.22
Yeah.

1073
00:58:34.22 --> 00:58:36.38
And I guess that doesn't really necessarily mean.

1074
00:58:36.38 --> 00:58:37.78
Telling jokes all the time.

1075
00:58:37.78 --> 00:58:39.50
No, just like levity.

1076
00:58:39.50 --> 00:58:41.14
Yeah, I feel that's funny.

1077
00:58:41.14 --> 00:58:42.14
I'm going to, you know.

1078
00:58:42.14 --> 00:58:47.74
Yeah, yeah, just having a good time making light of these miserable situations for sure.

1079
00:58:47.74 --> 00:58:48.74
Hmm.

1080
00:58:48.74 --> 00:58:58.22
Said Admiral, this is going into the next chapter, which is called main springs of leadership.

1081
00:58:58.22 --> 00:59:02.86
Said Admiral, forest, p-shermon, chief of naval operations.

1082
00:59:02.86 --> 00:59:07.02
I concur that we can take average good men.

1083
00:59:07.02 --> 00:59:13.18
And by proper training, developing them the essential initiative, constant confidence,

1084
00:59:13.18 --> 00:59:17.06
and magnetism, which are necessary in leadership.

1085
00:59:17.06 --> 00:59:22.46
I believe that these qualities are present in the average man to a degree that he can be

1086
00:59:22.46 --> 00:59:27.90
made a good leader if his native qualities are properly developed.

1087
00:59:27.90 --> 00:59:32.78
Whether or not he becomes a great leader depends upon whether or not he possesses that extra

1088
00:59:32.78 --> 00:59:40.10
initiative, magnetism, moral courage and force, which makes the difference between the average

1089
00:59:40.10 --> 00:59:43.46
man and the above average man.

1090
00:59:43.46 --> 00:59:48.86
The general CBKates, common down to the Marine Corps, leadership is intangible, hard to

1091
00:59:48.86 --> 00:59:51.22
measure and difficult to describe.

1092
00:59:51.22 --> 00:59:56.66
Its qualities would seem to stem from many factors, but certainly they must include a measure

1093
00:59:56.66 --> 00:59:59.54
of inherent ability to control and direct.

1094
00:59:59.54 --> 01:00:06.74
Self-confidence based on expert knowledge, initiative, loyalty, pride, and sense of responsibility.

1095
01:00:06.74 --> 01:00:12.66
Inherinability obviously cannot be instilled, but that which is latent or dormant can be

1096
01:00:12.66 --> 01:00:15.06
developed.

1097
01:00:15.06 --> 01:00:17.54
Other ingredients can be acquired.

1098
01:00:17.54 --> 01:00:25.22
They are not easily taught or easily learned, but leaders can be and can be and are made.

1099
01:00:25.22 --> 01:00:32.18
The average good man in our service is and must be considered a potential leader.

1100
01:00:32.18 --> 01:00:33.98
So there you go to that question.

1101
01:00:33.98 --> 01:00:38.38
It's the same answer that I give, basically all the time when people ask me if leaders

1102
01:00:38.38 --> 01:00:42.94
are born or made, there's the answer from these two guys they agree with me or I'll

1103
01:00:42.94 --> 01:00:45.50
say I agree with them since they're senior to me.

1104
01:00:45.50 --> 01:00:49.06
But look, you got certain traits.

1105
01:00:49.06 --> 01:00:52.74
You can take, I always say look, you can take someone that's an okay leader and make

1106
01:00:52.74 --> 01:00:53.74
them a better leader.

1107
01:00:53.74 --> 01:00:56.74
You can take a good leader and make them an outstanding leader and outstanding leader.

1108
01:00:56.74 --> 01:01:00.86
You can make them epic leader because you can improve these things.

1109
01:01:00.86 --> 01:01:02.98
You can learn about these things.

1110
01:01:02.98 --> 01:01:06.54
The one person that you can't make any better is the person that's not humble.

1111
01:01:06.54 --> 01:01:10.38
They're not going to get any better because they can't be coached because standing in his

1112
01:01:10.38 --> 01:01:12.42
own light, because he's standing in his own light.

1113
01:01:12.42 --> 01:01:20.14
Maybe we'll bring that back in and bring that back back to the book and before I go

1114
01:01:20.14 --> 01:01:21.98
back to the book.

1115
01:01:21.98 --> 01:01:25.86
This is another thing I get asked about a lot is people ask me because they know that

1116
01:01:25.86 --> 01:01:27.86
I work a lot.

1117
01:01:27.86 --> 01:01:29.86
They know that I get after it.

1118
01:01:29.86 --> 01:01:30.86
Right?

1119
01:01:30.86 --> 01:01:35.22
And they ask me about, you know, how do you, how do you do with your family?

1120
01:01:35.22 --> 01:01:39.66
You got a family because I got four children and a wife and a goldfish.

1121
01:01:39.66 --> 01:01:40.66
Okay.

1122
01:01:40.66 --> 01:01:44.46
So, I sickle.

1123
01:01:44.46 --> 01:01:45.46
That's the name.

1124
01:01:45.46 --> 01:01:46.46
That's the name.

1125
01:01:46.46 --> 01:01:47.46
Right?

1126
01:01:47.46 --> 01:01:49.62
So, I got to give, you know, to the family, right?

1127
01:01:49.62 --> 01:01:52.26
So people say, how do you, how do you balance?

1128
01:01:52.26 --> 01:01:53.26
So here we go.

1129
01:01:53.26 --> 01:01:54.26
Back to the book.

1130
01:01:54.26 --> 01:02:01.70
Personal advancement within any worthwhile system requires some sacrifice of leisure and more

1131
01:02:01.70 --> 01:02:08.50
careful attention to the better organization of ones working routine.

1132
01:02:08.50 --> 01:02:16.42
But that does not entail heroic self-sacrifice or forfeiting of any of life's truly enduring

1133
01:02:16.42 --> 01:02:18.42
rewards.

1134
01:02:18.42 --> 01:02:23.06
It means putting the completion of work ahead of golf.

1135
01:02:23.06 --> 01:02:25.06
Yeah.

1136
01:02:25.06 --> 01:02:31.66
So, so often you see people that you're just, I'm not going to work my way.

1137
01:02:31.66 --> 01:02:32.66
Myself to death.

1138
01:02:32.66 --> 01:02:33.66
Okay.

1139
01:02:33.66 --> 01:02:34.66
Are you going to play golf to death?

1140
01:02:34.66 --> 01:02:36.66
Because that's apparently what you're trying to do here.

1141
01:02:36.66 --> 01:02:37.66
Right?

1142
01:02:37.66 --> 01:02:39.66
But yeah, you got to find balance.

1143
01:02:39.66 --> 01:02:43.82
You got to find balance, especially when he's talking about life's true and enduring rewards.

1144
01:02:43.82 --> 01:02:52.10
That's talking about your family and the things that you achieve outside of the work world.

1145
01:02:52.10 --> 01:02:53.10
Abbey dimnet.

1146
01:02:53.10 --> 01:03:04.42
Abbey dimnet was a priest, a priest in wrote a book called The Art of Thinking.

1147
01:03:04.42 --> 01:03:05.70
And he's quoted here in this book.

1148
01:03:05.70 --> 01:03:13.46
He said, concentration is supposed to be exceptional only because people do not try and

1149
01:03:13.46 --> 01:03:21.70
in this as so many things starve within an inch of plenty.

1150
01:03:21.70 --> 01:03:22.70
You're almost there.

1151
01:03:22.70 --> 01:03:23.70
Almost there.

1152
01:03:23.70 --> 01:03:29.70
Almost got plenty, but you're starting to death.

1153
01:03:29.70 --> 01:03:30.70
Right there.

1154
01:03:30.70 --> 01:03:31.70
We're in an inch.

1155
01:03:31.70 --> 01:03:32.70
Why?

1156
01:03:32.70 --> 01:03:33.70
Because you failed to concentrate.

1157
01:03:33.70 --> 01:03:34.70
You failed to focus.

1158
01:03:34.70 --> 01:03:39.70
And that's what happens.

1159
01:03:39.70 --> 01:03:41.70
Oh, and well, this is just awesome.

1160
01:03:41.70 --> 01:03:42.70
Here we go.

1161
01:03:42.70 --> 01:03:49.70
There is, of course, that commonest of excuses for rejecting the difficult and taking life

1162
01:03:49.70 --> 01:03:50.70
easy.

1163
01:03:50.70 --> 01:03:53.70
I haven't time.

1164
01:03:53.70 --> 01:03:59.82
But for the man who keeps his mind on the object, there is always time.

1165
01:03:59.82 --> 01:04:01.42
Figure it out.

1166
01:04:01.42 --> 01:04:06.82
About us in the service as daily, we see busy men who somehow manage to find time for whatever

1167
01:04:06.82 --> 01:04:09.18
is worth doing.

1168
01:04:09.18 --> 01:04:15.62
While at the adjoining desks, our others with abundant leisure who can't find time for

1169
01:04:15.62 --> 01:04:17.82
anything.

1170
01:04:17.82 --> 01:04:24.82
And something important requires doing is usually the busy man who gets the call.

1171
01:04:24.82 --> 01:04:28.46
Time got time for that, huh?

1172
01:04:28.46 --> 01:04:29.46
There's always time.

1173
01:04:29.46 --> 01:04:30.46
Yeah.

1174
01:04:30.46 --> 01:04:31.46
Always time.

1175
01:04:31.46 --> 01:04:36.98
And how can you ever have time if you don't take time?

1176
01:04:36.98 --> 01:04:39.26
That sounds cool, but I don't know what it means.

1177
01:04:39.26 --> 01:04:40.26
Expand.

1178
01:04:40.26 --> 01:04:41.26
Oh, who has time?

1179
01:04:41.26 --> 01:04:44.82
Ah, but how can you ever have time if you don't take time?

1180
01:04:44.82 --> 01:04:45.82
Oh, so you're going to take out.

1181
01:04:45.82 --> 01:04:46.82
Okay.

1182
01:04:46.82 --> 01:04:47.66
Okay.

1183
01:04:47.66 --> 01:04:48.66
So, is that where it's from?

1184
01:04:48.66 --> 01:04:51.66
The mate, like part two or something like that.

1185
01:04:51.66 --> 01:04:53.66
Did some, there was a part two to that movie?

1186
01:04:53.66 --> 01:04:56.66
I think there was like a part three too.

1187
01:04:56.66 --> 01:04:58.14
Anyway, that was a good one.

1188
01:04:58.14 --> 01:04:59.14
It's true though.

1189
01:04:59.14 --> 01:05:04.66
You know how like, guys will be like, hey, I want to get in like really good shape or something

1190
01:05:04.66 --> 01:05:05.66
like this.

1191
01:05:05.66 --> 01:05:06.66
I want to get like real strong or whatever.

1192
01:05:06.66 --> 01:05:07.66
I was like, okay.

1193
01:05:07.66 --> 01:05:08.66
You have to work out like this.

1194
01:05:08.66 --> 01:05:12.66
I don't have like time to both, then you don't have time then.

1195
01:05:12.66 --> 01:05:13.66
You then you can't get in shape.

1196
01:05:13.66 --> 01:05:16.66
It's like saying I don't have the inclination.

1197
01:05:16.66 --> 01:05:18.66
It's more or less the same thing.

1198
01:05:18.66 --> 01:05:19.66
I don't have the time.

1199
01:05:19.66 --> 01:05:30.66
Yeah, I was with one of my buddies and we were counseling someone and my buddy said,

1200
01:05:30.66 --> 01:05:32.66
you don't care about this.

1201
01:05:32.66 --> 01:05:36.66
Then the guy says, no, no, I do care.

1202
01:05:36.66 --> 01:05:38.66
And he said, well, why can't you show up on time?

1203
01:05:38.66 --> 01:05:41.66
If you cared, you would show up on time.

1204
01:05:41.66 --> 01:05:42.66
And K's closed.

1205
01:05:42.66 --> 01:05:43.66
You're fired.

1206
01:05:43.66 --> 01:05:44.66
That was that.

1207
01:05:44.66 --> 01:05:45.66
I was like, well, you know what?

1208
01:05:45.66 --> 01:05:47.66
Let's just stop talking because we're done.

1209
01:05:47.66 --> 01:05:48.66
We're done.

1210
01:05:48.66 --> 01:05:49.66
That's 100% accurate.

1211
01:05:49.66 --> 01:05:50.66
So old true.

1212
01:05:50.66 --> 01:05:54.66
So, as you probably know, I come from a long line of lately.

1213
01:05:54.66 --> 01:05:56.66
Yes, we've discussed that before.

1214
01:05:56.66 --> 01:05:59.66
So I kind of analyzed it.

1215
01:05:59.66 --> 01:06:01.66
Where there was a time where I felt like,

1216
01:06:01.66 --> 01:06:02.66
I just, I don't know.

1217
01:06:02.66 --> 01:06:04.66
I just can't be on.

1218
01:06:04.66 --> 01:06:07.66
It's like, it's like almost like this like a mentor physical black almost.

1219
01:06:07.66 --> 01:06:08.66
That's what I felt like.

1220
01:06:08.66 --> 01:06:10.66
But then.

1221
01:06:10.66 --> 01:06:11.66
Okay.

1222
01:06:11.66 --> 01:06:13.66
Really analyzed.

1223
01:06:13.66 --> 01:06:16.66
When you really realized that you were just lazy.

1224
01:06:16.66 --> 01:06:17.66
No, I'm not lazy.

1225
01:06:17.66 --> 01:06:18.66
It wasn't important.

1226
01:06:18.66 --> 01:06:19.66
Just like what you're saying.

1227
01:06:19.66 --> 01:06:22.66
And this is what, so let's say work for example.

1228
01:06:22.66 --> 01:06:24.66
I was late literally more times than I was on time.

1229
01:06:24.66 --> 01:06:25.66
At work.

1230
01:06:25.66 --> 01:06:26.66
I was so many times.

1231
01:06:26.66 --> 01:06:28.66
Well, I did a good enough job.

1232
01:06:28.66 --> 01:06:29.66
I would have fired you.

1233
01:06:29.66 --> 01:06:31.66
And then rehired you so I could fire you.

1234
01:06:31.66 --> 01:06:32.66
You started to take pleasure.

1235
01:06:32.66 --> 01:06:34.66
You probably would have been a good idea.

1236
01:06:34.66 --> 01:06:35.66
Nonetheless.

1237
01:06:35.66 --> 01:06:37.66
So when I analyzed it, I was like,

1238
01:06:37.66 --> 01:06:38.66
Why am I late?

1239
01:06:38.66 --> 01:06:41.66
Why don't I get prepared the night before?

1240
01:06:41.66 --> 01:06:44.66
Whatever it takes to be on time every single time.

1241
01:06:44.66 --> 01:06:46.66
And just like, it's not important.

1242
01:06:46.66 --> 01:06:51.66
Like, why would I spend my off work time preparing to go be at work?

1243
01:06:51.66 --> 01:06:52.66
Yeah.

1244
01:06:52.66 --> 01:06:57.66
I should be resting or that's my off time watching a little bit more television.

1245
01:06:57.66 --> 01:06:59.66
TV or yeah, whatever.

1246
01:06:59.66 --> 01:07:00.66
Not working.

1247
01:07:00.66 --> 01:07:02.66
I can squeeze in another episode of this program.

1248
01:07:02.66 --> 01:07:03.66
Exactly right.

1249
01:07:03.66 --> 01:07:04.66
Not working.

1250
01:07:04.66 --> 01:07:07.66
Why should I spend off work time doing work stuff?

1251
01:07:07.66 --> 01:07:09.66
Like, I'm not getting paid or kind of thing.

1252
01:07:09.66 --> 01:07:10.66
You know, it's not important.

1253
01:07:10.66 --> 01:07:15.66
And that's going back to what this whole book starting off with the attitude of trying to do good job all the time.

1254
01:07:15.66 --> 01:07:17.66
And actually somebody brought that up.

1255
01:07:17.66 --> 01:07:18.66
It's somebody sent me a direct message.

1256
01:07:18.66 --> 01:07:20.66
And this was a great point that I didn't think about.

1257
01:07:20.66 --> 01:07:23.66
We got asked another question on the podcast about,

1258
01:07:23.66 --> 01:07:27.66
Hey, if you're getting told to go to a meeting that you're not going to get paid for.

1259
01:07:27.66 --> 01:07:29.66
Remember that conversation?

1260
01:07:29.66 --> 01:07:32.66
This guy wrote me and said, Hey, you know, legally that that's illegal.

1261
01:07:32.66 --> 01:07:38.66
If you're on an hourly wage, so that's a great point that I didn't think of it from a HR perspective.

1262
01:07:38.66 --> 01:07:41.66
But that's a good point. Now you got people that you're breaking a law.

1263
01:07:41.66 --> 01:07:45.66
So I kind of assume that these guys were not being specifically compensated,

1264
01:07:45.66 --> 01:07:49.66
but that they were maybe salary employees that they were.

1265
01:07:49.66 --> 01:07:50.66
But I could be wrong.

1266
01:07:50.66 --> 01:07:55.66
And if those people are hourly, now you got to go to the boss and say, Hey, boss,

1267
01:07:55.66 --> 01:08:01.66
I want to get this meeting going, but what you're doing to us and what you're doing to these guys is illegal.

1268
01:08:01.66 --> 01:08:02.66
Yeah.

1269
01:08:02.66 --> 01:08:07.66
You know, maybe the manager a lot of times managers are salaryed and the workers are hourly.

1270
01:08:07.66 --> 01:08:10.66
So he would need to go look, I'll come to the meeting because I'm on salary. It's all good with me.

1271
01:08:10.66 --> 01:08:11.66
I'm here to win.

1272
01:08:11.66 --> 01:08:14.66
But the guys, I can't bring him in here unless you want to be looking at a,

1273
01:08:14.66 --> 01:08:17.66
at a labor lawsuit, you in the game for that boss, because I'm not.

1274
01:08:17.66 --> 01:08:20.66
That's going to cost our company money. It's going to make us look bad.

1275
01:08:20.66 --> 01:08:22.66
Let's, let's do this another way.

1276
01:08:22.66 --> 01:08:22.66
Yeah.

1277
01:08:22.66 --> 01:08:23.66
Boom.

1278
01:08:23.66 --> 01:08:27.66
But that is a different element to the whole, like the point as far as what you're talking.

1279
01:08:27.66 --> 01:08:31.66
We're what you're talking about, like it's something like not important versus if you're in person.

1280
01:08:31.66 --> 01:08:34.66
Like it doesn't necessarily go for just work that's why.

1281
01:08:34.66 --> 01:08:39.66
It goes for anything, like if you're late to anything, like if you, if you, like this podcast,

1282
01:08:39.66 --> 01:08:41.66
I'm rolling in late every single time.

1283
01:08:41.66 --> 01:08:46.66
It's obviously because being on time is not important and that leads into this podcast.

1284
01:08:46.66 --> 01:08:50.66
And one way or another, what we're about to do isn't important enough.

1285
01:08:50.66 --> 01:08:53.66
That's why you're on time because it is important to you.

1286
01:08:53.66 --> 01:08:54.66
There you go.

1287
01:08:54.66 --> 01:08:55.66
Boom.

1288
01:08:55.66 --> 01:08:56.66
Because it's important to me to you.

1289
01:08:56.66 --> 01:09:03.66
And I will spend off my quote and quote free time doing stuff to prepare for, you know, the on time.

1290
01:09:03.66 --> 01:09:04.66
It's stuff.

1291
01:09:04.66 --> 01:09:05.66
We're got it's good.

1292
01:09:05.66 --> 01:09:07.66
And you seem to say otherwise you'd be getting fired.

1293
01:09:07.66 --> 01:09:09.66
I'm just using this as a hype.

1294
01:09:09.66 --> 01:09:11.66
Give me another echo Charles.

1295
01:09:11.66 --> 01:09:13.66
You're going to throw the right one.

1296
01:09:13.66 --> 01:09:15.66
You don't even know the difference.

1297
01:09:15.66 --> 01:09:16.66
Yeah.

1298
01:09:16.66 --> 01:09:17.66
Good.

1299
01:09:17.66 --> 01:09:18.66
Although he probably genetically has the same problem.

1300
01:09:18.66 --> 01:09:19.66
Yeah.

1301
01:09:19.66 --> 01:09:21.66
I told you we come from a long line.

1302
01:09:21.66 --> 01:09:24.66
Now he knows the importance of, you know.

1303
01:09:24.66 --> 01:09:27.66
And it's a, and it's a sign of disrespect, too, by the way.

1304
01:09:27.66 --> 01:09:28.66
Yes.

1305
01:09:28.66 --> 01:09:32.66
It's like saying not only do I not think what we're, what we've planned to do or agreed to do.

1306
01:09:32.66 --> 01:09:33.66
And all this time stuff.

1307
01:09:33.66 --> 01:09:36.66
Not only do I not think that's important.

1308
01:09:36.66 --> 01:09:39.66
I don't respect how much you think it's important.

1309
01:09:39.66 --> 01:09:41.66
That's what we respect my time.

1310
01:09:41.66 --> 01:09:42.66
Nope.

1311
01:09:42.66 --> 01:09:43.66
Not at all.

1312
01:09:43.66 --> 01:09:44.66
Not at all.

1313
01:09:44.66 --> 01:09:45.66
The on time.

1314
01:09:45.66 --> 01:09:46.66
Well.

1315
01:09:46.66 --> 01:09:47.66
And make time.

1316
01:09:47.66 --> 01:09:48.66
Take time.

1317
01:09:48.66 --> 01:09:53.66
If, yeah, if you want to have time, you got to take care.

1318
01:09:53.66 --> 01:09:54.66
Yeah.

1319
01:09:54.66 --> 01:10:00.66
And that's what's so like about this guy's actually making fun of people that say I haven't got time.

1320
01:10:00.66 --> 01:10:09.66
Because for the man who keeps his mind on the object there is always time.

1321
01:10:09.66 --> 01:10:16.66
Next section says, much is conveyed in, in few words, in Army field forces brief on practical

1322
01:10:16.66 --> 01:10:18.66
concepts of leadership.

1323
01:10:18.66 --> 01:10:25.66
It is stressed therein that the preeminent quality, which all great commanders have owned

1324
01:10:25.66 --> 01:10:31.16
common is a posiveness of manner and viewpoint.

1325
01:10:31.16 --> 01:10:39.78
The power to concentrate on means to a given end to the exclusion of exaggerated fears of the

1326
01:10:39.78 --> 01:10:45.34
obstacles which lie afroarch the course.

1327
01:10:45.34 --> 01:10:47.66
Every word of that should be underscored.

1328
01:10:47.66 --> 01:10:53.66
And above all, what it says about the need for affirmative thinking and concentrating on how things

1329
01:10:53.66 --> 01:10:54.66
can be done.

1330
01:10:54.66 --> 01:10:55.66
This is the part.

1331
01:10:55.66 --> 01:10:56.66
You always hear about this.

1332
01:10:56.66 --> 01:10:58.66
You always hear about this person.

1333
01:10:58.66 --> 01:11:02.66
The person that says, when you go to them and say, hey, can we do this?

1334
01:11:02.66 --> 01:11:04.66
They're always looking for a way to say no.

1335
01:11:04.66 --> 01:11:08.10
A reason why something can happen instead of, no, we can do that.

1336
01:11:08.10 --> 01:11:09.10
We can make that happen.

1337
01:11:09.10 --> 01:11:10.74
We can figure out a way.

1338
01:11:10.74 --> 01:11:14.66
That's what we're looking for.

1339
01:11:14.66 --> 01:11:16.66
Next section.

1340
01:11:16.66 --> 01:11:25.02
Those in this section is actually the same topic of what this podcast is the topic of and

1341
01:11:25.02 --> 01:11:29.06
that is human nature.

1342
01:11:29.06 --> 01:11:33.94
Those who had the chance to study American men under the terrible rigor of Japanese and

1343
01:11:33.94 --> 01:11:41.34
prison during World War II gave an analysis that in certain of the prisoners, character

1344
01:11:41.34 --> 01:11:47.02
insanity with it, held fast against every circumstance.

1345
01:11:47.02 --> 01:11:53.98
In others, some of whom had been well educated and came from gentle homes, the brute instinct

1346
01:11:53.98 --> 01:12:00.38
was as uppermost as in an east African cannibal.

1347
01:12:00.38 --> 01:12:04.02
And when they say brute instinct, that's the person that just loses and goes to the animal

1348
01:12:04.02 --> 01:12:07.22
instincts.

1349
01:12:07.22 --> 01:12:14.42
Some such crucibles as these even more than from the remittance stresses of combat and war

1350
01:12:14.42 --> 01:12:19.86
comes the clearest light on the inner nature of man in so far as it needs to be understood

1351
01:12:19.86 --> 01:12:25.54
by the officer who may someday lead a force into battle.

1352
01:12:25.54 --> 01:12:33.10
Human nature.

1353
01:12:33.10 --> 01:12:39.18
One of the things that he says about human nature in here is good will and weakness, maybe

1354
01:12:39.18 --> 01:12:44.78
combined in one man, bad will and strength in another.

1355
01:12:44.78 --> 01:12:49.18
High moral leading can lift the first man to excel himself.

1356
01:12:49.18 --> 01:12:52.18
It will not reform the other.

1357
01:12:52.18 --> 01:12:59.26
But there is no other sensible rule, then that all men will be approached with trust and

1358
01:12:59.26 --> 01:13:06.26
treated his trust trustworthy until proved otherwise beyond reasonable doubt.

1359
01:13:06.26 --> 01:13:08.70
So he's thrown out the trust.

1360
01:13:08.70 --> 01:13:09.70
He's a little bit of an option.

1361
01:13:09.70 --> 01:13:10.70
I've talked about it.

1362
01:13:10.70 --> 01:13:13.86
I actually, I should take that back.

1363
01:13:13.86 --> 01:13:17.18
Remember one time on the podcast, I said, look, I don't have a high expectation of people

1364
01:13:17.18 --> 01:13:18.18
when I meet him.

1365
01:13:18.18 --> 01:13:21.30
And I hold that true to this day.

1366
01:13:21.30 --> 01:13:24.26
But I don't straight up not trust them as a human.

1367
01:13:24.26 --> 01:13:25.26
Yeah.

1368
01:13:25.26 --> 01:13:26.26
There's a difference there.

1369
01:13:26.26 --> 01:13:27.26
I think there's a difference.

1370
01:13:27.26 --> 01:13:28.26
I think I feel that way.

1371
01:13:28.26 --> 01:13:32.98
There is a, yeah, and it's not an obvious difference, but it's like the difference between

1372
01:13:32.98 --> 01:13:35.14
I don't have an high expectation of somebody.

1373
01:13:35.14 --> 01:13:37.98
And versus I have a low expectation of person.

1374
01:13:37.98 --> 01:13:38.98
Got it.

1375
01:13:38.98 --> 01:13:39.98
Somebody.

1376
01:13:39.98 --> 01:13:41.98
So it does sound the same.

1377
01:13:41.98 --> 01:13:42.98
It sounds the same.

1378
01:13:42.98 --> 01:13:45.98
It's not an expectation than what kind of expectation do you have?

1379
01:13:45.98 --> 01:13:46.98
No.

1380
01:13:46.98 --> 01:13:47.98
No.

1381
01:13:47.98 --> 01:13:48.98
Maybe just a neutral one.

1382
01:13:48.98 --> 01:13:49.98
Right.

1383
01:13:49.98 --> 01:13:51.70
Like I'm not going to put any expectations.

1384
01:13:51.70 --> 01:13:56.06
I'm not expecting you to do a bunch of hero, I don't have any expectations.

1385
01:13:56.06 --> 01:13:57.06
Just neutral.

1386
01:13:57.06 --> 01:14:00.26
I come in with a neutral attitude on that one.

1387
01:14:00.26 --> 01:14:01.26
Yeah.

1388
01:14:01.26 --> 01:14:06.22
Back to the book, Men do not achieve a great solidarity or preserve it simply by being

1389
01:14:06.22 --> 01:14:08.02
together.

1390
01:14:08.02 --> 01:14:14.30
Their mutual bonds are forged only by doing together, that which they have been convinced

1391
01:14:14.30 --> 01:14:17.22
is constructive.

1392
01:14:17.22 --> 01:14:23.34
The absence of a common purpose is the chief source of unhappiness in any collection

1393
01:14:23.34 --> 01:14:25.62
of individuals.

1394
01:14:25.62 --> 01:14:32.34
Talking it and the common standard of justice, which is one of its chief agents, men become

1395
01:14:32.34 --> 01:14:39.58
more and more separate units, each fighting for his own rights.

1396
01:14:39.58 --> 01:14:41.46
This is why you got to have that common purpose.

1397
01:14:41.46 --> 01:14:43.38
This is why that commander's intent is so important.

1398
01:14:43.38 --> 01:14:47.42
This is why it's important that everyone understands why they're doing what they're doing.

1399
01:14:47.42 --> 01:14:51.70
They have to understand the strategic goal that you're trying to meet as a company, as

1400
01:14:51.70 --> 01:14:55.58
a business, as a team, as a platoon.

1401
01:14:55.58 --> 01:15:00.34
And that's a person and like a lot of people, they go into straight up depression.

1402
01:15:00.34 --> 01:15:03.66
Because I mean, if they don't see the big goal, if they don't see a purpose in their

1403
01:15:03.66 --> 01:15:08.82
life, that is true.

1404
01:15:08.82 --> 01:15:18.70
Back to the book, whatever his rank, it is impossible for any man to lead if he is himself

1405
01:15:18.70 --> 01:15:21.18
running behind.

1406
01:15:21.18 --> 01:15:26.98
This bespeaks the need of constant study, the constant use of one's personal powers and

1407
01:15:26.98 --> 01:15:30.42
the exercise of the imagination.

1408
01:15:30.42 --> 01:15:36.66
As men advance, that which was good soon ceases to be good simply because something

1409
01:15:36.66 --> 01:15:37.98
better is possible.

1410
01:15:37.98 --> 01:15:40.10
You got to evolve.

1411
01:15:40.10 --> 01:15:45.42
You got to continue to evolve, you got to continue to improve yourself.

1412
01:15:45.42 --> 01:15:51.10
History confirms, and a study of the workings of the human mind supports one proposition

1413
01:15:51.10 --> 01:15:57.34
which many of the great captains of war have accepted as a truism.

1414
01:15:57.34 --> 01:15:59.66
There are no bad troops.

1415
01:15:59.66 --> 01:16:03.02
There are only bad leaders.

1416
01:16:03.02 --> 01:16:05.02
Yeah.

1417
01:16:05.02 --> 01:16:06.02
Interesting.

1418
01:16:06.02 --> 01:16:11.90
It's here Napoleon said, Napoleon said there's no bad kernels, only bad regiments.

1419
01:16:11.90 --> 01:16:14.42
Hackworth said the same thing.

1420
01:16:14.42 --> 01:16:15.42
No bad team.

1421
01:16:15.42 --> 01:16:20.50
I think he said no bad troops, only bad officers in the book that Laefan, I wrote, no bad

1422
01:16:20.50 --> 01:16:21.82
teams, only bad leaders.

1423
01:16:21.82 --> 01:16:30.82
So very common and very true stands the test of time.

1424
01:16:30.82 --> 01:16:34.38
You know, there's a reason why Napoleon fought that.

1425
01:16:34.38 --> 01:16:37.42
There's a reason why SLA Marshall said that.

1426
01:16:37.42 --> 01:16:39.10
There's a reason why Hackworth said that.

1427
01:16:39.10 --> 01:16:41.42
There's a reason why Laefan, I put that in the book.

1428
01:16:41.42 --> 01:16:42.90
Because that is true.

1429
01:16:42.90 --> 01:16:47.38
In the minute you, if you're in a leadership position, the minute that you accept that fact

1430
01:16:47.38 --> 01:16:50.10
is the minute you step forward as becoming a better leader.

1431
01:16:50.10 --> 01:16:53.82
Because as soon as you're blaming it on other people, you're just not going to make

1432
01:16:53.82 --> 01:16:54.82
it bad.

1433
01:16:54.82 --> 01:16:55.82
Oh my team sucks.

1434
01:16:55.82 --> 01:16:56.82
You suck.

1435
01:16:56.82 --> 01:16:57.82
Right.

1436
01:16:57.82 --> 01:16:58.82
So it's lit.

1437
01:16:58.82 --> 01:17:03.82
I don't know if you call this irony or what, but no bad team is only bad leaders.

1438
01:17:03.82 --> 01:17:05.66
So if you're like, wait, that's not true.

1439
01:17:05.66 --> 01:17:06.66
Oh, guess what?

1440
01:17:06.66 --> 01:17:07.66
You're bad leader.

1441
01:17:07.66 --> 01:17:08.66
Yeah.

1442
01:17:08.66 --> 01:17:11.66
It's a good ticket catch 22.

1443
01:17:11.66 --> 01:17:12.66
Yeah, yeah.

1444
01:17:12.66 --> 01:17:17.58
What's good for the goose is good for the, again, actually, I don't think that's it.

1445
01:17:17.58 --> 01:17:19.58
Alright, this is awesome.

1446
01:17:19.58 --> 01:17:21.82
Here we go, back to the book.

1447
01:17:21.82 --> 01:17:26.38
And this, actually, this section here has gone to group nature.

1448
01:17:26.38 --> 01:17:29.38
So you've gone from human nature to group nature.

1449
01:17:29.38 --> 01:17:36.52
Back to the book, among the commonest of experiences in war is to witness troops doing

1450
01:17:36.52 --> 01:17:43.82
nothing or worse doing the wrong thing without one commanding voice being raised to give

1451
01:17:43.82 --> 01:17:45.78
them direction.

1452
01:17:45.78 --> 01:17:52.90
Such circumstance any man who has the nerve and presence to step forward and give them an

1453
01:17:52.90 --> 01:17:59.70
intelligent order in a manner indicating that he expects to be obeyed will be accepted

1454
01:17:59.70 --> 01:18:02.98
as a leader and will be given their support.

1455
01:18:02.98 --> 01:18:04.54
Did you hear that?

1456
01:18:04.54 --> 01:18:05.54
That's all it is.

1457
01:18:05.54 --> 01:18:06.54
Who's going to step up?

1458
01:18:06.54 --> 01:18:10.94
Who's going to have the nerve and the presence to step up and give an intelligent

1459
01:18:10.94 --> 01:18:14.54
order that you believe in and that you believe will be followed on?

1460
01:18:14.54 --> 01:18:17.82
I did you expect to be obeyed, you'll be obeyed.

1461
01:18:17.82 --> 01:18:21.30
So again, I hear all these people say, well, you know, the senior position, therefore

1462
01:18:21.30 --> 01:18:22.86
I can't do anything wrong.

1463
01:18:22.86 --> 01:18:24.26
Actually, you can.

1464
01:18:24.26 --> 01:18:28.06
Step up and lead.

1465
01:18:28.06 --> 01:18:32.54
Back to the book for this reason, under the conditions of modern battle, the coherence of any

1466
01:18:32.54 --> 01:18:40.62
military body comes not only of men being articulate all down the line, but of building

1467
01:18:40.62 --> 01:18:45.18
up the dynamic power in each individual.

1468
01:18:45.18 --> 01:18:50.54
It is a thoroughly sound exercise in any unit to give every man a chance to take charge

1469
01:18:50.54 --> 01:18:55.70
and give orders in drill or other limited exercises once he has learned what the orders

1470
01:18:55.70 --> 01:18:57.66
mean.

1471
01:18:57.66 --> 01:19:03.62
By the same token, it is good practice for the junior leader to displace a file.

1472
01:19:03.62 --> 01:19:08.10
That means just one of the guys to displace a file in a training exercise and become

1473
01:19:08.10 --> 01:19:13.06
commanded for a time to sharpen his own perspective.

1474
01:19:13.06 --> 01:19:20.26
So it's good for the junior guys to step up into leadership positions and lead.

1475
01:19:20.26 --> 01:19:23.82
It's good for the leaders to go and be one of the boys in the cartoon.

1476
01:19:23.82 --> 01:19:28.10
I got really lucky because I was a prior, I'm a prior and listed guy, I'm a mustang

1477
01:19:28.10 --> 01:19:29.10
officer.

1478
01:19:29.10 --> 01:19:33.94
So I spent my first eight years in the suit teams as a guy in the, I was one of the

1479
01:19:33.94 --> 01:19:34.94
files.

1480
01:19:34.94 --> 01:19:38.26
So I knew what it was like when a leader didn't tell you what was going on, I knew

1481
01:19:38.26 --> 01:19:41.18
what it was like when you had a good leader.

1482
01:19:41.18 --> 01:19:46.18
So when I stepped up into those leadership positions, I knew at least what not to do.

1483
01:19:46.18 --> 01:19:48.54
And I knew what I would try and do to be a good leader.

1484
01:19:48.54 --> 01:19:51.54
It's like the curse of knowledge.

1485
01:19:51.54 --> 01:19:55.34
Like you don't curse the knowledge just when you can't see it from some inexperienced

1486
01:19:55.34 --> 01:19:57.54
person's point of view.

1487
01:19:57.54 --> 01:20:00.18
And so you don't really have that.

1488
01:20:00.18 --> 01:20:01.18
Because you've been the inexperienced.

1489
01:20:01.18 --> 01:20:02.58
You can just draw on those memories.

1490
01:20:02.58 --> 01:20:05.78
You know, I have that perspective that full I know what is nice to do.

1491
01:20:05.78 --> 01:20:10.46
I don't want to worst things in your at the end of a 16 man seal, put you in patrolling

1492
01:20:10.46 --> 01:20:12.82
through the night and you just have no idea where you are.

1493
01:20:12.82 --> 01:20:14.46
You have no idea how far the target is away.

1494
01:20:14.46 --> 01:20:15.82
You have no idea when you're going to stop.

1495
01:20:15.82 --> 01:20:16.82
You have no idea of anything.

1496
01:20:16.82 --> 01:20:23.30
You're just rocking like a miserable boots, boots, boots.

1497
01:20:23.30 --> 01:20:26.02
That's what you're getting the zone of.

1498
01:20:26.02 --> 01:20:27.26
It's just the worst.

1499
01:20:27.26 --> 01:20:30.90
So when I was a platoon commander, I was a squad leader.

1500
01:20:30.90 --> 01:20:36.06
But I tried with everything I had to make sure everyone knew what's going on all the time.

1501
01:20:36.06 --> 01:20:38.94
Because I never wanted my guys to be thinking, what is happening?

1502
01:20:38.94 --> 01:20:39.94
What are we doing?

1503
01:20:39.94 --> 01:20:45.22
Yeah, that's good.

1504
01:20:45.22 --> 01:20:49.74
Progress comes of making the most of our strengths rather than looking for ways to repair

1505
01:20:49.74 --> 01:20:51.34
weaknesses.

1506
01:20:51.34 --> 01:20:54.10
This is true in things both large and small.

1507
01:20:54.10 --> 01:20:59.54
The platoon leader who permits himself to be be deviled by the file who won't or can't

1508
01:20:59.54 --> 01:21:05.22
keep step cannot do justice to the ambitions of the 10 strongest men beneath him.

1509
01:21:05.22 --> 01:21:11.06
Upon whom the life of the formation would depend common emergency.

1510
01:21:11.06 --> 01:21:16.62
To nourish and encourage the top rather than to concentrate effort and exhaust nerves and

1511
01:21:16.62 --> 01:21:22.74
trying to correct a few least likely prospects is the healthy way of growth within military

1512
01:21:22.74 --> 01:21:24.62
organization.

1513
01:21:24.62 --> 01:21:27.34
Take care of your top people, put your photo, focus and energy them.

1514
01:21:27.34 --> 01:21:30.94
And I was going to give some time to the guys that are struggling, trying to help them

1515
01:21:30.94 --> 01:21:31.94
out.

1516
01:21:31.94 --> 01:21:33.26
But let's not focus on them.

1517
01:21:33.26 --> 01:21:35.18
They're not going to make a break you.

1518
01:21:35.18 --> 01:21:37.30
So it's leaders that you want to develop.

1519
01:21:37.30 --> 01:21:40.22
You got a good seed that's starting to grow.

1520
01:21:40.22 --> 01:21:42.22
Water that seed.

1521
01:21:42.22 --> 01:21:44.18
Don't worry about that thing over there in the corner.

1522
01:21:44.18 --> 01:21:49.18
That's not doing anything.

1523
01:21:49.18 --> 01:21:51.82
It is a good, this is classic.

1524
01:21:51.82 --> 01:21:58.34
It is a sign of a good level of discipline in command when orders are given and faithfully

1525
01:21:58.34 --> 01:22:00.62
carried out.

1526
01:22:00.62 --> 01:22:07.62
But it is a sign of a vastly superior condition when the men are prepared to demand those

1527
01:22:07.62 --> 01:22:12.62
orders which they know the situation requires if it is to be helped.

1528
01:22:12.62 --> 01:22:17.26
No competent subordinate sits around waiting for someone else to give impulse to movement

1529
01:22:17.26 --> 01:22:21.74
if he senses if his senses tell him that things are going to pot.

1530
01:22:21.74 --> 01:22:27.18
Either suggest a course of action to his superior or ask authority to execute it on his

1531
01:22:27.18 --> 01:22:36.22
own or in the more desperate circumstances of the battlefield gives orders on his own initiative.

1532
01:22:36.22 --> 01:22:38.54
Descentualized command.

1533
01:22:38.54 --> 01:22:39.90
Everybody's a leader.

1534
01:22:39.90 --> 01:22:44.74
Everybody steps up and makes things happen.

1535
01:22:44.74 --> 01:22:48.50
Back to the book, General Dwight D. Eisenhower was thinking on these things when he said

1536
01:22:48.50 --> 01:22:49.82
during World War II.

1537
01:22:49.82 --> 01:22:55.42
There is among the massive individuals who carry rifles in war, a great amount of ingenuity

1538
01:22:55.42 --> 01:22:57.30
and efficiency.

1539
01:22:57.30 --> 01:23:02.78
If men can talk naturally to their officers, the product of their resourcefulness becomes

1540
01:23:02.78 --> 01:23:06.62
available to all.

1541
01:23:06.62 --> 01:23:09.50
So as long as you can, as long as you're guys feel comfortable talking to you, you're

1542
01:23:09.50 --> 01:23:14.82
going to have access to all their ideas and all their ingenuity back to the book, but

1543
01:23:14.82 --> 01:23:20.10
the art of open communication requires both receiving and ending and the besetting

1544
01:23:20.10 --> 01:23:26.06
problems to get officers to talk naturally to men.

1545
01:23:26.06 --> 01:23:30.58
Develop the relationships with the troops is what you got to do.

1546
01:23:30.58 --> 01:23:39.02
Another section here at all training, all training at all levels has a dual object to

1547
01:23:39.02 --> 01:23:45.70
develop us all as leaders of men and as followers of leaders.

1548
01:23:45.70 --> 01:23:46.70
dichotomy.

1549
01:23:46.70 --> 01:23:47.70
Got to be a leader.

1550
01:23:47.70 --> 01:23:48.70
Got to be a follower.

1551
01:23:48.70 --> 01:23:50.70
It's like your Twitter thing.

1552
01:23:50.70 --> 01:23:53.10
You're Twitter by a leader follower.

1553
01:23:53.10 --> 01:23:54.10
Oh, beaker listener.

1554
01:23:54.10 --> 01:23:55.10
Let it dichotomy.

1555
01:23:55.10 --> 01:23:56.10
Right, or reader?

1556
01:23:56.10 --> 01:23:57.10
Right, or reader, yeah.

1557
01:23:57.10 --> 01:23:58.10
Exactly.

1558
01:23:58.10 --> 01:24:02.90
That is, that is, there's a dichotomy there.

1559
01:24:02.90 --> 01:24:09.90
To the book, the paralysis which comes of fear can be lifted only through the resumption

1560
01:24:09.90 --> 01:24:14.90
of action, which will again give individuals the feeling of organization.

1561
01:24:14.90 --> 01:24:15.94
So this is interesting.

1562
01:24:15.94 --> 01:24:26.90
We remember that Joe Owen, when he was in Korea, in the coldest war, in colder than hell,

1563
01:24:26.90 --> 01:24:28.54
he's freezing.

1564
01:24:28.54 --> 01:24:29.90
And there's shooting starts.

1565
01:24:29.90 --> 01:24:32.58
And he's got his own procedure of how he's going to overcome the fear.

1566
01:24:32.58 --> 01:24:33.58
He's going to do, he's going to take action.

1567
01:24:33.58 --> 01:24:35.78
And it's something that I've said on here a bunch of times here.

1568
01:24:35.78 --> 01:24:36.78
You're afraid of something?

1569
01:24:36.78 --> 01:24:37.78
Take action.

1570
01:24:37.78 --> 01:24:38.78
Step into it.

1571
01:24:38.78 --> 01:24:43.14
So what this is saying is the same thing, but not on an individual level, but on a group

1572
01:24:43.14 --> 01:24:44.14
level.

1573
01:24:44.14 --> 01:24:45.42
Because we're talking about group nature here.

1574
01:24:45.42 --> 01:24:48.66
And it's the same thing as you do with an individual.

1575
01:24:48.66 --> 01:24:49.66
You do it the group.

1576
01:24:49.66 --> 01:24:50.66
So listen to this again.

1577
01:24:50.66 --> 01:24:56.34
The paralysis, which comes of fear, can be lifted only through the resumption of action, which

1578
01:24:56.34 --> 01:25:01.46
will again give the individuals feeling of organization.

1579
01:25:01.46 --> 01:25:06.78
This does not mean ordering a bayonet charge or firing a volley at such and such a clock.

1580
01:25:06.78 --> 01:25:12.46
It may mean only padding one man on the back, talking it up to a couple of others, sending

1581
01:25:12.46 --> 01:25:19.46
someone out to find a flank or turning one's self to dig in, while passing the word

1582
01:25:19.46 --> 01:25:22.42
to others to do likewise.

1583
01:25:22.42 --> 01:25:27.78
This is action in the realist sense of the term.

1584
01:25:27.78 --> 01:25:34.78
Re-invigorating men toward the faking of many small actions develops the possibility

1585
01:25:34.78 --> 01:25:37.54
of large and decisive action.

1586
01:25:37.54 --> 01:25:44.42
The unit must first find itself before doing an effective job of finding the enemy out

1587
01:25:44.42 --> 01:25:51.22
of those acts, which are incidental to the establishing of an order, the leader reaffirms

1588
01:25:51.22 --> 01:25:53.42
his own power of decision.

1589
01:25:53.42 --> 01:25:56.02
So those are beautiful advice.

1590
01:25:56.02 --> 01:26:00.50
Just like you do with yourself, you're afraid of something, take action, step into it.

1591
01:26:00.50 --> 01:26:03.02
You got your group and everyone started to get scared and overwhelmed.

1592
01:26:03.02 --> 01:26:04.02
Let's take some action.

1593
01:26:04.02 --> 01:26:05.02
Hey guys, dig in.

1594
01:26:05.02 --> 01:26:07.78
Hey guys, online.

1595
01:26:07.78 --> 01:26:11.46
Whatever that order is going to be, that's that for it may not solve the problem, but it

1596
01:26:11.46 --> 01:26:16.90
regains your stability as a team.

1597
01:26:16.90 --> 01:26:23.10
Now you can move forward.

1598
01:26:23.10 --> 01:26:29.26
This next section is subtitled environment.

1599
01:26:29.26 --> 01:26:34.58
Back to the book, it is only to the man who is burned with unnecessary and exaggerated

1600
01:26:34.58 --> 01:26:42.86
fear, fears, and who mistakes for fancy security, the privilege of sitting quietly in one

1601
01:26:42.86 --> 01:26:50.10
place that the uprooting which comes with war is demoralizing.

1602
01:26:50.10 --> 01:26:55.34
The natural officer sees it as an hour of opportunity.

1603
01:26:55.34 --> 01:27:01.62
And though he may not like anything else about war, he at least relishes the strong feeling

1604
01:27:01.62 --> 01:27:08.54
of personal contention which always develop develops when there are many openings inviting

1605
01:27:08.54 --> 01:27:10.70
many men.

1606
01:27:10.70 --> 01:27:17.78
As a world war to commander expressed it, during war, the ball is always kicking around

1607
01:27:17.78 --> 01:27:25.58
loose in the middle of the field and any man who has the will may pick it up and run

1608
01:27:25.58 --> 01:27:30.10
with it.

1609
01:27:30.10 --> 01:27:35.70
That's true by life so many opportunities out there who's going to pick it up and run

1610
01:27:35.70 --> 01:27:39.50
with it becomes the question.

1611
01:27:39.50 --> 01:27:45.42
Now we get into touching back a little bit onto some discipline.

1612
01:27:45.42 --> 01:27:51.30
Back to the book, when men are given absolute freedom, with no compulsion upon them but

1613
01:27:51.30 --> 01:27:59.32
to eat and sleep as with a group of South Sea savages, there can be no strong uniting

1614
01:27:59.32 --> 01:28:06.38
bond between them.

1615
01:28:06.38 --> 01:28:08.74
Absolute freedom doesn't get you what you want.

1616
01:28:08.74 --> 01:28:11.74
There's got to be a counter to that and that counter is discipline.

1617
01:28:11.74 --> 01:28:15.82
I suppose that's another politically incorrect thing that we've run into the book a couple

1618
01:28:15.82 --> 01:28:19.46
times the South Sea savages.

1619
01:28:19.46 --> 01:28:23.22
Who's the technically probably natives from the South Sea?

1620
01:28:23.22 --> 01:28:24.22
Oh, yes.

1621
01:28:24.22 --> 01:28:27.22
In fact, that is who it is.

1622
01:28:27.22 --> 01:28:29.30
Okay, all right, there you go.

1623
01:28:29.30 --> 01:28:34.22
No offense intended.

1624
01:28:34.22 --> 01:28:39.90
Back to the book, in officership there is simply no substitute for personal reconnaissance.

1625
01:28:39.90 --> 01:28:44.86
Do or any other technique that in the long run will have half its value.

1626
01:28:44.86 --> 01:28:47.94
So when he's talking about personal reconnaissance here, he's not talking about going to

1627
01:28:47.94 --> 01:28:50.98
reconniscence of an enemy position.

1628
01:28:50.98 --> 01:28:58.46
He's talking about going down and reconnaissance doing reconnaissance within your own element,

1629
01:28:58.46 --> 01:28:59.46
talking to your people.

1630
01:28:59.46 --> 01:29:01.46
What he's talking about here.

1631
01:29:01.46 --> 01:29:04.86
He's talking about that habit of personal reconnaissance.

1632
01:29:04.86 --> 01:29:11.46
Once formed, the habit of getting down to the roots of organization, of seeing with

1633
01:29:11.46 --> 01:29:17.50
one's own eyes what is taking place, of measuring it against one's own scale of values,

1634
01:29:17.50 --> 01:29:22.66
of ordering such changes as our needed and of following through to make certain that

1635
01:29:22.66 --> 01:29:28.86
the changes are made becomes the main spring of all efficient command action.

1636
01:29:28.86 --> 01:29:32.34
In battle, there is no other way to be sure.

1637
01:29:32.34 --> 01:29:38.58
In training, there is no better way to move towards self assurance.

1638
01:29:38.58 --> 01:29:43.30
So get down there, get in the weed, sometimes see what's going on in the front lines, talk

1639
01:29:43.30 --> 01:29:50.02
to your people.

1640
01:29:50.02 --> 01:29:52.26
This section talks about the mission.

1641
01:29:52.26 --> 01:29:57.66
When an order is given, what are the responsibilities of the man who receives it?

1642
01:29:57.66 --> 01:30:03.30
In sequence, these, to be certain that he understands what is required, to examine and

1643
01:30:03.30 --> 01:30:10.94
organize his resources as promptly as possible, to inform his subordinates upon these points,

1644
01:30:10.94 --> 01:30:17.82
to execute the order without waste of time or means, to call for support if events prove

1645
01:30:17.82 --> 01:30:23.50
that his means are inadequate, to fill up the spaces in the orders if there are developments

1646
01:30:23.50 --> 01:30:26.86
which had not been anticipated.

1647
01:30:26.86 --> 01:30:32.50
When the detail is complete, to prepare to go on to something else.

1648
01:30:32.50 --> 01:30:37.86
Straight forward, Lieutenant General Sir Frederick Morgan, who planned the invasion of Normandy,

1649
01:30:37.86 --> 01:30:42.30
put the matter this way, when setting out on any enterprise.

1650
01:30:42.30 --> 01:30:46.42
It is well, it is as well to ask oneself three questions.

1651
01:30:46.42 --> 01:30:49.30
To whom is one responsible?

1652
01:30:49.30 --> 01:30:55.34
For what precisely is one responsible, what are the means that disposable at disposal

1653
01:30:55.34 --> 01:30:58.74
for discharging this responsibility?

1654
01:30:58.74 --> 01:31:01.94
Nothing so warms the heart of a superior.

1655
01:31:01.94 --> 01:31:08.14
As that, on giving an order, he sees his subordinates salute and say, yes, sir, then about

1656
01:31:08.14 --> 01:31:15.66
face and proceed to carry it out to the hilt without faltering or looking back.

1657
01:31:15.66 --> 01:31:20.66
This is the kind of a man that a commander will choose to have with him every time and that

1658
01:31:20.66 --> 01:31:24.14
he will recommend for first advancement.

1659
01:31:24.14 --> 01:31:30.90
On the other hand, clarification of the object is not only a right but a duty and it cuts

1660
01:31:30.90 --> 01:31:32.30
both ways.

1661
01:31:32.30 --> 01:31:38.42
So if you don't understand, you have the duty to ask for clarification.

1662
01:31:38.42 --> 01:31:44.66
Orders are not always clear and no superior is on firm ground when he is inpatient of questions

1663
01:31:44.66 --> 01:31:48.78
which are to the point or resentful of the man who asks him.

1664
01:31:48.78 --> 01:31:50.22
I say this all the time.

1665
01:31:50.22 --> 01:31:54.86
If your subordinates say, why are we doing this and you get angry, you're wrong.

1666
01:31:54.86 --> 01:31:58.70
You should be happy that your subordinates ask him why.

1667
01:31:58.70 --> 01:32:03.82
But it is natural that he will be doubtful of the man who's words show either that he

1668
01:32:03.82 --> 01:32:08.98
hasn't heard or is concerned mainly with the relevancies.

1669
01:32:08.98 --> 01:32:15.30
The cultivation of the habit of careful, concentrated listening and of collected thought

1670
01:32:15.30 --> 01:32:24.06
and reading into any problem is principle, portal to successful officership.

1671
01:32:24.06 --> 01:32:28.34
From the pen of general, Eisenhower comes these words.

1672
01:32:28.34 --> 01:32:35.46
The commander's success will be measured more by his ability to lead than by his adherence

1673
01:32:35.46 --> 01:32:39.54
to fixed notions.

1674
01:32:39.54 --> 01:32:46.74
Thus, in the conduct of operations not less than in the execution of orders, it is necessary

1675
01:32:46.74 --> 01:32:51.38
that the mind remain plastic and impressionable.

1676
01:32:51.38 --> 01:32:57.98
Again, the idea of the military man is this person that can't change and is close-minded.

1677
01:32:57.98 --> 01:32:58.98
It's wrong.

1678
01:32:58.98 --> 01:33:01.86
Now there are military leaders like that.

1679
01:33:01.86 --> 01:33:02.86
And it's unfortunate.

1680
01:33:02.86 --> 01:33:03.86
They're not good.

1681
01:33:03.86 --> 01:33:06.14
You got to have the flexible mind.

1682
01:33:06.14 --> 01:33:07.74
You got to have the plastic mind.

1683
01:33:07.74 --> 01:33:14.66
Obedience is not the product of fear, but of understanding and understanding is based

1684
01:33:14.66 --> 01:33:15.66
on knowledge.

1685
01:33:15.66 --> 01:33:17.78
So you got to make sure that your troops understand what's going on.

1686
01:33:17.78 --> 01:33:18.78
So they know what's going on.

1687
01:33:18.78 --> 01:33:25.06
So they can obey properly, not out of fear.

1688
01:33:25.06 --> 01:33:32.46
To grasp the spirit of orders is not less important than to accept them cheerfully and

1689
01:33:32.46 --> 01:33:36.46
keep faith with the contract.

1690
01:33:36.46 --> 01:33:41.86
But the letter of an instruction does not relieve him who receives it from the obligation

1691
01:33:41.86 --> 01:33:45.18
to exercise common sense.

1692
01:33:45.18 --> 01:33:46.98
You get told to do something you still got to do.

1693
01:33:46.98 --> 01:33:48.86
You still got to hold common sense.

1694
01:33:48.86 --> 01:33:54.54
In the Carolina Manuvers of 1941, a soldier stood at a road intersection for three days

1695
01:33:54.54 --> 01:33:58.42
and nights directing civilian traffic simply because the man who put him there had

1696
01:33:58.42 --> 01:34:00.62
forgotten all about it.

1697
01:34:00.62 --> 01:34:05.10
Though he was praised at the time, he was hardly a shining example of the hold up to

1698
01:34:05.10 --> 01:34:22.90
the troops moving into the next chapter, which the name of the chapter is discipline.

1699
01:34:22.90 --> 01:34:25.86
This is, you're going to recognize this one.

1700
01:34:25.86 --> 01:34:32.90
Once a man condones remisses his own belief in discipline begins to wither.

1701
01:34:32.90 --> 01:34:39.18
The officer who tolerate slackness in the dress of his men soon ceases to tend his own

1702
01:34:39.18 --> 01:34:41.18
appearance.

1703
01:34:41.18 --> 01:34:45.58
And if he is not called to account, his sloppy habits will shortly begin to inflict

1704
01:34:45.58 --> 01:34:48.18
his superior.

1705
01:34:48.18 --> 01:34:50.78
There's only one correct way to wear the uniform.

1706
01:34:50.78 --> 01:34:55.38
When any deviations and dress are condoned within the services, the way is open to the

1707
01:34:55.38 --> 01:34:59.94
destruction of all uniformity and unity.

1708
01:34:59.94 --> 01:35:03.50
It's not what you preach.

1709
01:35:03.50 --> 01:35:07.78
You condoned remisses.

1710
01:35:07.78 --> 01:35:08.78
You're opening.

1711
01:35:08.78 --> 01:35:11.30
Now, this might be a little bit extreme.

1712
01:35:11.30 --> 01:35:15.26
When he says that when you're out of uniform, you allow these units of the way is open

1713
01:35:15.26 --> 01:35:18.06
to the destruction of all uniformity and unity.

1714
01:35:18.06 --> 01:35:20.70
I'm not sure I 100% agree with that.

1715
01:35:20.70 --> 01:35:25.50
And I was always very pro uniform and making sure that guys were square to wear in their

1716
01:35:25.50 --> 01:35:26.50
uniforms.

1717
01:35:26.50 --> 01:35:34.74
With the most stringent in the seal teams, in the seal teams, is not uniforms are not real

1718
01:35:34.74 --> 01:35:38.18
good at wearing uniforms and looking good uniforms and being square to wear uniforms.

1719
01:35:38.18 --> 01:35:42.34
So it's kind of hard for me to agree that that opens up the way for the destruction of all

1720
01:35:42.34 --> 01:35:43.82
uniformity.

1721
01:35:43.82 --> 01:35:48.94
But the lesson here is more about the uniforms.

1722
01:35:48.94 --> 01:35:51.26
It's more about just, it's not what you preach.

1723
01:35:51.26 --> 01:35:52.26
It's what you dollar it.

1724
01:35:52.26 --> 01:35:54.26
Yeah, that's slippery slope situation.

1725
01:35:54.26 --> 01:35:55.26
Yes, it is.

1726
01:35:55.26 --> 01:36:00.78
Well, opening the ways it necessarily ensuring something true.

1727
01:36:00.78 --> 01:36:01.78
True.

1728
01:36:01.78 --> 01:36:02.78
True.

1729
01:36:02.78 --> 01:36:04.38
I'll give it to you.

1730
01:36:04.38 --> 01:36:06.78
You get me on the technicality sometimes, that's fine.

1731
01:36:06.78 --> 01:36:09.54
Okay, with that, I'm plastic in my mind.

1732
01:36:09.54 --> 01:36:14.30
I can accept that plastic, you know, some people say plastic like, oh, that guys,

1733
01:36:14.30 --> 01:36:16.74
but plastic, meaning like he's fake or something like that.

1734
01:36:16.74 --> 01:36:17.74
Oh, yeah.

1735
01:36:17.74 --> 01:36:18.74
This is for like plasticity.

1736
01:36:18.74 --> 01:36:20.74
Yes, absolutely.

1737
01:36:20.74 --> 01:36:26.02
In the 1950 before plastic was everything that we used.

1738
01:36:26.02 --> 01:36:31.10
I used to have this theory that anything that was made of metal was better.

1739
01:36:31.10 --> 01:36:32.38
It just made everything of metal.

1740
01:36:32.38 --> 01:36:34.90
I wanted to make everything that was made metal.

1741
01:36:34.90 --> 01:36:35.90
Right.

1742
01:36:35.90 --> 01:36:36.90
Don't they say stuff?

1743
01:36:36.90 --> 01:36:39.18
That's the same thing about like food and bacon.

1744
01:36:39.18 --> 01:36:40.18
Like anything bacon is better.

1745
01:36:40.18 --> 01:36:41.18
Similar.

1746
01:36:41.18 --> 01:36:42.18
Similar.

1747
01:36:42.18 --> 01:36:43.18
It would be correct.

1748
01:36:43.18 --> 01:36:44.18
Yeah.

1749
01:36:44.18 --> 01:36:45.18
It can's good.

1750
01:36:45.18 --> 01:36:47.18
Yeah.

1751
01:36:47.18 --> 01:36:48.18
Back to the book.

1752
01:36:48.18 --> 01:36:49.50
No leader ever fails his men.

1753
01:36:49.50 --> 01:36:55.82
No, they fail him who leads them in respect for the discipline of life.

1754
01:36:55.82 --> 01:37:01.26
Between these two things, discipline in itself and a personal faith in the military value

1755
01:37:01.26 --> 01:37:08.50
of discipline lies all the difference between military maturity and mediocrity.

1756
01:37:08.50 --> 01:37:16.86
A salute from an unwilling man is as meaningless as the moving of a leaf on a tree.

1757
01:37:16.86 --> 01:37:21.50
It is a sign only that the subject has been caught by a gust of wind.

1758
01:37:21.50 --> 01:37:25.78
But a salute from the man who takes pride in the gesture because he feels privileged

1759
01:37:25.78 --> 01:37:30.78
to wear the uniform of the United States having found the service good is the epitome

1760
01:37:30.78 --> 01:37:39.26
of military virtue.

1761
01:37:39.26 --> 01:37:46.78
Until man are severely tried, there is no conclusive test of their discipline nor proof.

1762
01:37:46.78 --> 01:37:54.30
That their training at arms is satisfying a legitimate military end.

1763
01:37:54.30 --> 01:37:58.86
Military forces remain relatively undisciplined until physically toughened and mentally

1764
01:37:58.86 --> 01:38:01.90
conditioned to unusual exertion.

1765
01:38:01.90 --> 01:38:04.90
Consider the road march.

1766
01:38:04.90 --> 01:38:11.34
No body of men could possibly enjoy the dust, the heat, the blistered foot and the aching

1767
01:38:11.34 --> 01:38:17.74
back, but a hard road marching is necessary if a sound foundation is to be built under

1768
01:38:17.74 --> 01:38:25.66
the discipline of fighting forces, particularly those whose labors are in the field.

1769
01:38:25.66 --> 01:38:27.78
And the gain comes quickly.

1770
01:38:27.78 --> 01:38:32.82
The rise in spirits within any organization which is always to be observed after they

1771
01:38:32.82 --> 01:38:37.74
rebound from a hard march does not come essentially from the feeling of relief that the

1772
01:38:37.74 --> 01:38:46.66
strain is passed but rather from the satisfaction that a goal has been crossed.

1773
01:38:46.66 --> 01:38:51.38
It must be accepted that discipline does not break down under the strain of placing a

1774
01:38:51.38 --> 01:38:54.62
testing demand upon the individual.

1775
01:38:54.62 --> 01:39:00.86
It is slough and not activity that destroys discipline.

1776
01:39:00.86 --> 01:39:03.46
Think about that one.

1777
01:39:03.46 --> 01:39:07.70
Although it is not the strain, it is not the pressure that you put that breaks down the

1778
01:39:07.70 --> 01:39:11.94
discipline, it is the laziness, it is the slough that breaks discipline.

1779
01:39:11.94 --> 01:39:17.22
Troops can endure hard going when it serves an understandable end.

1780
01:39:17.22 --> 01:39:19.54
This is what they will boast about.

1781
01:39:19.54 --> 01:39:23.74
Mainly when the fatigue is ended, a large part of training is necessarily directed toward

1782
01:39:23.74 --> 01:39:28.02
conditioning them for unusual hardship and privation.

1783
01:39:28.02 --> 01:39:33.14
They can take it and stride, but no power on earth can reconcile them to what common sense

1784
01:39:33.14 --> 01:39:37.94
tells them is unnecessary hardship which might have been avoided by greater intelligence

1785
01:39:37.94 --> 01:39:40.46
in their superiors.

1786
01:39:40.46 --> 01:39:43.66
If you are telling people to do something, they realize that there is an easier way to do

1787
01:39:43.66 --> 01:39:45.02
it.

1788
01:39:45.02 --> 01:39:50.58
They are going to be angry when they are overloaded, they know it.

1789
01:39:50.58 --> 01:39:55.58
When they are required to form a parade two hours ahead of time because their commander got

1790
01:39:55.58 --> 01:40:00.90
over anxious or didn't know how to write an order, again, they know it.

1791
01:40:00.90 --> 01:40:04.94
They are perfectly right if they go sour because this kind of thing happens a little too

1792
01:40:04.94 --> 01:40:09.46
often within the command.

1793
01:40:09.46 --> 01:40:17.26
Within our system, that discipline is nearest perfect which assures to the individual, the

1794
01:40:17.26 --> 01:40:22.78
greatest freedom of thought and action.

1795
01:40:22.78 --> 01:40:29.82
While at all times promoting his feeling of responsibility toward the group, the red,

1796
01:40:29.82 --> 01:40:35.18
do you hear about the greatest form of discipline is the one that gives the greatest freedom

1797
01:40:35.18 --> 01:40:36.94
of thought and action?

1798
01:40:36.94 --> 01:40:37.94
That's what we want.

1799
01:40:37.94 --> 01:40:44.70
We want the discipline to equal freedom.

1800
01:40:44.70 --> 01:40:50.18
That's interesting his take on like when you go through some hard stuff, the satisfaction

1801
01:40:50.18 --> 01:40:51.46
isn't that it's over.

1802
01:40:51.46 --> 01:40:54.46
It's the fact that you did that absolutely.

1803
01:40:54.46 --> 01:40:58.14
Yeah, it's like, you know, I told you, it might hold sleep.

1804
01:40:58.14 --> 01:41:03.22
I mean, we'll use to be it worth if I didn't get my half hours done for the day.

1805
01:41:03.22 --> 01:41:07.54
But so now let's say I get two hours sleep.

1806
01:41:07.54 --> 01:41:10.34
And I'm like, hey, I'm gonna still do this work.

1807
01:41:10.34 --> 01:41:13.38
I would do whatever this condition is something hard.

1808
01:41:13.38 --> 01:41:14.38
Sure, it's gonna be hard.

1809
01:41:14.38 --> 01:41:15.38
Sure, I'm not looking forward to it.

1810
01:41:15.38 --> 01:41:19.62
But yeah, the satisfaction is afterwards all you can go to, how it's at it, you're gonna

1811
01:41:19.62 --> 01:41:20.62
have something to brag about.

1812
01:41:20.62 --> 01:41:22.58
If there's something like that, that's true.

1813
01:41:22.58 --> 01:41:26.22
You go and tell your friends, hey, I did this way only to hours sleep.

1814
01:41:26.22 --> 01:41:27.22
Got it.

1815
01:41:27.22 --> 01:41:30.54
Yeah, you do kind of have that feeling like you want to brag about it.

1816
01:41:30.54 --> 01:41:31.54
No doubt.

1817
01:41:31.54 --> 01:41:32.90
Like I did some hard stuff.

1818
01:41:32.90 --> 01:41:35.18
You know, we shouldn't be surprised.

1819
01:41:35.18 --> 01:41:39.78
We're kind of getting excited when these things completely make sense.

1820
01:41:39.78 --> 01:41:46.34
These are, these are generals that knew and understand human nature.

1821
01:41:46.34 --> 01:41:50.70
And these are things that we look at and we learn and we've experienced.

1822
01:41:50.70 --> 01:41:52.10
So it shouldn't come as a surprise.

1823
01:41:52.10 --> 01:41:53.10
Yeah, I know.

1824
01:41:53.10 --> 01:41:54.10
It's crazy.

1825
01:41:54.10 --> 01:41:58.14
It's like tunnel vision, you know, where it'll happen and you almost like you don't

1826
01:41:58.14 --> 01:41:59.34
even realize it'll happen.

1827
01:41:59.34 --> 01:42:00.34
Everyone does that.

1828
01:42:00.34 --> 01:42:01.34
Everyone does something for hard.

1829
01:42:01.34 --> 01:42:02.34
For sure.

1830
01:42:02.34 --> 01:42:04.78
Get through hard work day, did something under these circumstances.

1831
01:42:04.78 --> 01:42:05.78
That they hate.

1832
01:42:05.78 --> 01:42:07.50
They might even be complaining about it.

1833
01:42:07.50 --> 01:42:10.18
Like, oh, this was going on so such a stressful day.

1834
01:42:10.18 --> 01:42:13.82
But when you get it actually done, you brag about it.

1835
01:42:13.82 --> 01:42:16.58
At the very least, you feel like you want to brag about it.

1836
01:42:16.58 --> 01:42:21.50
And keep that good person that, you know, keep that up.

1837
01:42:21.50 --> 01:42:22.98
Now there's some counter to that.

1838
01:42:22.98 --> 01:42:23.98
Here we go.

1839
01:42:23.98 --> 01:42:29.30
Back to the book, if the man is cramped by monotonous routine or made to feel that he

1840
01:42:29.30 --> 01:42:34.90
cannot move unless an order is barked, he cannot develop these qualities and he will never

1841
01:42:34.90 --> 01:42:36.22
come forward as a junior leader.

1842
01:42:36.22 --> 01:42:40.98
So if you put too much discipline on somebody, they're going to your crept their leadership

1843
01:42:40.98 --> 01:42:41.98
up capabilities.

1844
01:42:41.98 --> 01:42:45.02
Say that all the time.

1845
01:42:45.02 --> 01:42:50.94
In the words of dupeque, who saw so deeply into the hearts of fighting men, if one does

1846
01:42:50.94 --> 01:43:00.18
not wish bonds broken, one should make them elastic and thereby strengthen them.

1847
01:43:00.18 --> 01:43:02.18
That's a guy.

1848
01:43:02.18 --> 01:43:05.26
He wrote a thing called the battle studies.

1849
01:43:05.26 --> 01:43:11.26
Well, actually, he didn't finish writing it because he got killed in action, fighting

1850
01:43:11.26 --> 01:43:14.46
fighting.

1851
01:43:14.46 --> 01:43:20.62
Napoleon, he was French, fighting again in the, say fighting the Russians.

1852
01:43:20.62 --> 01:43:28.50
But yet another great quote from him that I wrote down, nothing can be, nothing can wisely

1853
01:43:28.50 --> 01:43:36.94
be prescribed in any army without exact knowledge of the fundamental instrument of man

1854
01:43:36.94 --> 01:43:42.82
and the state of mind, his morale at the instant of combat.

1855
01:43:42.82 --> 01:43:48.26
So to peak is a guy that really started looking at the mentality of guys.

1856
01:43:48.26 --> 01:43:52.74
We might have to get it.

1857
01:43:52.74 --> 01:43:55.38
We might have to dive into him at some point.

1858
01:43:55.38 --> 01:44:00.70
Now, speaking of morale, the next section is about morale.

1859
01:44:00.70 --> 01:44:03.70
A word war to blue jacket said it this way.

1860
01:44:03.70 --> 01:44:07.26
Blue jacket's turn for Navy guys said it this way.

1861
01:44:07.26 --> 01:44:13.38
Morales when your hands and feet keep working when your head says it can't be done.

1862
01:44:13.38 --> 01:44:18.34
The handiest beginning is to consider morale and conjunction with discipline.

1863
01:44:18.34 --> 01:44:23.38
Since in military service, their opposite sides of the same coin, when one is present,

1864
01:44:23.38 --> 01:44:28.10
the other will also be there.

1865
01:44:28.10 --> 01:44:30.50
Moral and discipline.

1866
01:44:30.50 --> 01:44:34.22
Moral and discipline, they go together.

1867
01:44:34.22 --> 01:44:35.50
This is a familiar story.

1868
01:44:35.50 --> 01:44:39.14
It was repeated by the United States forces in World War II during the Normandy had

1869
01:44:39.14 --> 01:44:44.22
road fighting and the invasions of the Central Pacific atolls.

1870
01:44:44.22 --> 01:44:49.46
Troops had to learn the hard way how to hit, how to survive, in moving through jungle

1871
01:44:49.46 --> 01:44:52.22
or cross mountains in the desert.

1872
01:44:52.22 --> 01:44:58.26
When that happened, the only disciplinary residue which mattered was obedience to orders.

1873
01:44:58.26 --> 01:45:05.02
The movements they had learned by rope were of less value than the spiritual bond between

1874
01:45:05.02 --> 01:45:08.02
one man and another.

1875
01:45:08.02 --> 01:45:12.26
The most valuable lesson was that of mutual support.

1876
01:45:12.26 --> 01:45:15.26
So, this is awesome.

1877
01:45:15.26 --> 01:45:19.78
The moves, the battle moves that they learned, that they trained, that were hard and put

1878
01:45:19.78 --> 01:45:22.58
them through this hard, getting ready to deploy overseas.

1879
01:45:22.58 --> 01:45:24.98
When they got overseas, they were fighting in a hedger, they never did that before, they're

1880
01:45:24.98 --> 01:45:26.86
fighting in a mountain, they never did that before.

1881
01:45:26.86 --> 01:45:30.78
So they had to take these drills that they had learned and kind of throw them out the window.

1882
01:45:30.78 --> 01:45:35.74
So all they had left and the most valuable thing of all that training wasn't to move

1883
01:45:35.74 --> 01:45:40.46
in themselves, it was the spiritual bond between these men.

1884
01:45:40.46 --> 01:45:43.98
That was more important than the tactical maneuvers, was the fact that they did hard training

1885
01:45:43.98 --> 01:45:49.98
together and they worked together and they knew each other and had that spiritual bond.

1886
01:45:49.98 --> 01:45:54.58
Back to the book, in its essentials discipline is not measured according to how a man

1887
01:45:54.58 --> 01:46:00.06
keeps step in a drill yard or whether he salutes it just the right angle.

1888
01:46:00.06 --> 01:46:07.66
The test is how well he willingly responds to his superior in all vital matters and finally,

1889
01:46:07.66 --> 01:46:12.70
whether he stands or runs when his life is at stake.

1890
01:46:12.70 --> 01:46:17.98
History makes this clear, there are countless examples of successful military forces

1891
01:46:17.98 --> 01:46:23.26
which had almost no discipline when measured by the usual yard sticks.

1892
01:46:23.26 --> 01:46:31.30
It had a high battle morale, productive of the kind of discipline which beats the enemy in battle.

1893
01:46:31.30 --> 01:46:33.62
So that's another little dichotomy, you know, they've talked about it.

1894
01:46:33.62 --> 01:46:38.26
You might not be the most disciplined on the parade field, but if you've got that bond

1895
01:46:38.26 --> 01:46:44.46
and you've got that discipline bond, you can still come up with the victory.

1896
01:46:44.46 --> 01:46:46.46
This is important.

1897
01:46:46.46 --> 01:46:52.26
Back to the book, man is able to recognize a right and reasonable discipline as such, even though

1898
01:46:52.26 --> 01:46:59.26
it causes him personal inconvenience because he's acquired a sense of military values.

1899
01:46:59.26 --> 01:47:10.14
But if it is either unduly harsh or unnecessarily lacks, he likewise knows it and

1900
01:47:10.14 --> 01:47:16.14
wears it as a hair shirt to the undoing of his morale.

1901
01:47:16.14 --> 01:47:23.02
So the man, like the group, can be hurt by being pushed beyond sensible limits, his spirit

1902
01:47:23.02 --> 01:47:25.86
will suffer even more sorely.

1903
01:47:25.86 --> 01:47:30.94
If no real test is put upon his abilities and moral powers.

1904
01:47:30.94 --> 01:47:35.58
The greater his intelligence, the stronger will be his resentment.

1905
01:47:35.58 --> 01:47:37.30
That is the law of nature.

1906
01:47:37.30 --> 01:47:43.06
The enlightened mind has always the greatest measure of self-discipline, but it also has

1907
01:47:43.06 --> 01:47:49.38
a higher sense of what constitutes justice, fair play and a reasonable requirement in the

1908
01:47:49.38 --> 01:47:52.42
performance of duty.

1909
01:47:52.42 --> 01:48:02.46
If denied these things, he will come to hold his chief, his job and himself in contempt.

1910
01:48:02.46 --> 01:48:05.18
So if you get the if you're a military leader or if you're a civilian leader and you get

1911
01:48:05.18 --> 01:48:08.70
the idea, okay, Jockel, talking about discipline, discipline's key, so you're going to come

1912
01:48:08.70 --> 01:48:14.58
in and just throw discipline on your people and burden them with this heavy realm of discipline,

1913
01:48:14.58 --> 01:48:19.22
it's not going to work out because everyone knows that it's unjust unfair.

1914
01:48:19.22 --> 01:48:21.50
Unnecessary.

1915
01:48:21.50 --> 01:48:25.50
We don't want that unnecessary discipline, but we embrace women.

1916
01:48:25.50 --> 01:48:29.62
I will believe that we deep inside, we embrace the hardcore discipline if it makes sense

1917
01:48:29.62 --> 01:48:36.50
and has meaning.

1918
01:48:36.50 --> 01:48:41.70
Admiral Ben Moril has stated a formula in understanding terms by his explanation of what

1919
01:48:41.70 --> 01:48:46.74
made the CB's notable for competence and devotion to duty during World War II.

1920
01:48:46.74 --> 01:48:51.38
What he said is this, we used artisans to do the work for which they had been trained in civilian

1921
01:48:51.38 --> 01:48:53.10
life.

1922
01:48:53.10 --> 01:48:56.06
They were well led by officers who spoke their language.

1923
01:48:56.06 --> 01:49:01.18
We made them feel that they were playing an important part in a great adventure and thus

1924
01:49:01.18 --> 01:49:04.30
they achieved a high standard of morale.

1925
01:49:04.30 --> 01:49:10.50
The elements underscored by Admiral Moril deserve special note, saddest faction in a work

1926
01:49:10.50 --> 01:49:16.62
program, mutual confidence between leaders and ranks conviction that all together were striving

1927
01:49:16.62 --> 01:49:19.82
for something more important than themselves.

1928
01:49:19.82 --> 01:49:27.42
Talk about the CB's, the construction battines and the Navy that do engineering work overseas

1929
01:49:27.42 --> 01:49:33.10
and I actually had CB's with us in a remedy that were awesome, awesome guys that didn't

1930
01:49:33.10 --> 01:49:38.62
everything for us, they kept everything going, kept everything running, kept everything working,

1931
01:49:38.62 --> 01:49:45.10
built everything that we used awesome guys and every CB I've ever worked with has been

1932
01:49:45.10 --> 01:49:48.06
just a beast, they have that attitude.

1933
01:49:48.06 --> 01:49:52.82
They know they're gonna, their motto is can't do and believe me when you tell them to

1934
01:49:52.82 --> 01:49:58.82
do something, they're 100% into that motto right there, they're gonna make it happen.

1935
01:49:58.82 --> 01:50:01.58
Here we go back to the book, talking about Moril.

1936
01:50:01.58 --> 01:50:06.78
Training conditions are in combat, the mental ills and the resulting morale, moral and

1937
01:50:06.78 --> 01:50:12.62
physical deterioration which sometimes be set military forces cannot be cured simply

1938
01:50:12.62 --> 01:50:16.38
by the intensification of disciplinary methods.

1939
01:50:16.38 --> 01:50:18.42
Can't just turn it up.

1940
01:50:18.42 --> 01:50:24.42
It is true that the signs of recovery will sometimes attend the installation of a more rigid

1941
01:50:24.42 --> 01:50:27.18
or less rigid discipline.

1942
01:50:27.18 --> 01:50:29.70
You can't just go up or down.

1943
01:50:29.70 --> 01:50:35.02
The onset is in fact usually due to the collateral influence of an increased confidence

1944
01:50:35.02 --> 01:50:42.58
in the command, whereby men are made to feel that their own fortunes are on the mend.

1945
01:50:42.58 --> 01:50:48.62
Then discipline and morale are together revitalized almost as if by throwing an electric

1946
01:50:48.62 --> 01:50:51.02
switch.

1947
01:50:51.02 --> 01:50:56.14
In Army history there's no better example of the working of this principle than the

1948
01:50:56.14 --> 01:51:00.38
work of Brigadier General Paul B. Malone.

1949
01:51:00.38 --> 01:51:03.62
He took over, this is World War I, 1919.

1950
01:51:03.62 --> 01:51:08.38
He took over a command where slackness and indiscipline were general.

1951
01:51:08.38 --> 01:51:12.38
The men were suffering terrible privation and too many of their officers were indifferent

1952
01:51:12.38 --> 01:51:14.26
to their needs.

1953
01:51:14.26 --> 01:51:18.06
Many of them had been battle casualties, some had been discharged from hospitals before

1954
01:51:18.06 --> 01:51:21.50
their wounds were healed, the mess was abominable.

1955
01:51:21.50 --> 01:51:26.34
The camp was short of firewood and other supply, in freezing weather, men were sleeping

1956
01:51:26.34 --> 01:51:30.18
on the ground with only a pair of blankets of peace.

1957
01:51:30.18 --> 01:51:36.46
The death toll from influenza pneumonia and the aggravation of battle wounds rose daily.

1958
01:51:36.46 --> 01:51:43.30
The spare and resentment over these conditions began to express itself in semi-violent form.

1959
01:51:43.30 --> 01:51:47.78
Every fresh breath of discipline was counted with harassing punishments until an air of

1960
01:51:47.78 --> 01:51:52.22
wretched stagnation hung over the whole camp.

1961
01:51:52.22 --> 01:51:54.94
General purging visited the base.

1962
01:51:54.94 --> 01:51:59.02
The men refused to form for him.

1963
01:51:59.02 --> 01:52:02.98
The men were through the generals coming in the men were not going to form up for him.

1964
01:52:02.98 --> 01:52:07.26
When he tried to address them at a mass meeting they wouldn't hear him out.

1965
01:52:07.26 --> 01:52:12.42
Instead of taking any action against the men he sent for general Malone.

1966
01:52:12.42 --> 01:52:16.10
The new commander arrived without any instructions except to determine what was wrong and

1967
01:52:16.10 --> 01:52:17.58
correct it.

1968
01:52:17.58 --> 01:52:23.94
It's sogently instinct he recognized that the indiscipline of the camp was an effect

1969
01:52:23.94 --> 01:52:26.46
and not a cause.

1970
01:52:26.46 --> 01:52:30.46
But even as he gave orders for leaving the physical distress of the men he demanded

1971
01:52:30.46 --> 01:52:32.58
that they returned to orderly habits.

1972
01:52:32.58 --> 01:52:35.94
He walked around the areas already on his orders.

1973
01:52:35.94 --> 01:52:39.22
On his orders duckboards were being laid throughout the mud.

1974
01:52:39.22 --> 01:52:42.66
And the whole physical setup was in a process of reorganization.

1975
01:52:42.66 --> 01:52:48.10
The men, grown listless from weeks of mistreatment, paid no heed.

1976
01:52:48.10 --> 01:52:49.10
Get on your feet.

1977
01:52:49.10 --> 01:52:50.10
I'm your general.

1978
01:52:50.10 --> 01:52:54.26
I respect you but I want your respect to where his words.

1979
01:52:54.26 --> 01:52:56.90
They restored the whole situation.

1980
01:52:56.90 --> 01:53:01.74
The first impact of this one man on the camp that was never forgotten by anyone who saw

1981
01:53:01.74 --> 01:53:03.38
it.

1982
01:53:03.38 --> 01:53:09.34
It is a point to remember, a firm hold at the beginning pays tenfold dividend of the

1983
01:53:09.34 --> 01:53:11.62
timid approach.

1984
01:53:11.62 --> 01:53:14.58
World by a show of firmness later on.

1985
01:53:14.58 --> 01:53:20.10
Within 48 hours the physical condition of the camp was showing improvement and 60,000 men

1986
01:53:20.10 --> 01:53:25.14
were again doing their duty and bearing themselves in a military manner.

1987
01:53:25.14 --> 01:53:32.58
The lessons from this one incident stand out like beams from a search light battery.

1988
01:53:32.58 --> 01:53:37.06
Leadership.

1989
01:53:37.06 --> 01:53:43.58
One man is able to accomplish a miracle by an active will accompanied by good works.

1990
01:53:43.58 --> 01:53:48.94
The morale of the force flows from self-discipline of the commander.

1991
01:53:48.94 --> 01:53:58.06
And in turn the discipline of the force is reestablished by the upsurge of its moral power.

1992
01:53:58.06 --> 01:54:02.06
Another example here, when the redeployment period which followed World War II threatened

1993
01:54:02.06 --> 01:54:06.46
to complete collapse to the morale of the general military establishment, the remedy

1994
01:54:06.46 --> 01:54:13.46
attempted by some unit leaders was to relax discipline and the work requirement all around.

1995
01:54:13.46 --> 01:54:17.58
Other officers met this crisis by improving the conditions of work, setting an example

1996
01:54:17.58 --> 01:54:22.42
which proved to the men that they believed in its importance and paying sensuous attention

1997
01:54:22.42 --> 01:54:25.98
to the personal problems of those within the unit.

1998
01:54:25.98 --> 01:54:31.06
They found that they could still get superior performance in the midst of chaos, organic

1999
01:54:31.06 --> 01:54:35.98
strength materializes in the same way on the field of war.

2000
01:54:35.98 --> 01:54:42.14
However, adverse the general situation, men will stick to the one man who knows what he wants

2001
01:54:42.14 --> 01:54:51.26
to do and welcomes them to a full share in the enterprise.

2002
01:54:51.26 --> 01:54:54.90
Leadership, leadership and leadership.

2003
01:54:54.90 --> 01:55:00.94
Most important thing on the battlefield.

2004
01:55:00.94 --> 01:55:06.46
In the words of Colonel G. F. R. Henderson, it is the leader who reckons with the human

2005
01:55:06.46 --> 01:55:12.50
nature of his troops and of the enemy rather than with their mere physical attributes,

2006
01:55:12.50 --> 01:55:17.98
numbers, armament and the like who can hope to follow in Napoleon's footsteps.

2007
01:55:17.98 --> 01:55:20.50
Got to know your people, got to know human nature.

2008
01:55:20.50 --> 01:55:22.50
Got to know human nature.

2009
01:55:22.50 --> 01:55:25.78
It's more important than physical, more important than people you got.

2010
01:55:25.78 --> 01:55:32.78
More important than their weapons, human nature.

2011
01:55:32.78 --> 01:55:37.86
There are a few governing principles and before considering their application in detail,

2012
01:55:37.86 --> 01:55:40.78
we should first think about the file.

2013
01:55:40.78 --> 01:55:43.54
So now we're talking about a guy, a troop, a soldier.

2014
01:55:43.54 --> 01:55:45.54
He is a man.

2015
01:55:45.54 --> 01:55:49.46
He expects to be treated as an adult, not a school boy.

2016
01:55:49.46 --> 01:55:50.70
He has rights.

2017
01:55:50.70 --> 01:55:55.74
They must be made known to him and thereafter respected.

2018
01:55:55.74 --> 01:55:57.58
He has ambition.

2019
01:55:57.58 --> 01:55:59.74
It must be stirred.

2020
01:55:59.74 --> 01:56:02.34
He has a belief in fair play.

2021
01:56:02.34 --> 01:56:04.98
It must be honored.

2022
01:56:04.98 --> 01:56:07.78
He has the need of comrade ship.

2023
01:56:07.78 --> 01:56:10.26
It must be supplied.

2024
01:56:10.26 --> 01:56:12.78
He has imagination.

2025
01:56:12.78 --> 01:56:14.50
It must be stimulated.

2026
01:56:14.50 --> 01:56:17.06
He has a personal sense of dignity.

2027
01:56:17.06 --> 01:56:20.74
It must not be broken down.

2028
01:56:20.74 --> 01:56:23.06
He has pride.

2029
01:56:23.06 --> 01:56:28.46
It can be satisfied and made the bedrock of his character once he gains assurance that

2030
01:56:28.46 --> 01:56:35.50
he is playing a useful and respected part in a superior and successful organization.

2031
01:56:35.50 --> 01:56:40.18
To give men working as a group, the feeling of great accomplishment together is the

2032
01:56:40.18 --> 01:56:45.14
acne of inspired leadership.

2033
01:56:45.14 --> 01:56:48.70
You could basically, if you're going into a leadership position, just read that to yourself

2034
01:56:48.70 --> 01:56:50.70
every morning.

2035
01:56:50.70 --> 01:56:54.22
Just what your support and what they are.

2036
01:56:54.22 --> 01:56:58.46
A man, be treated as adult, not a school boy.

2037
01:56:58.46 --> 01:57:04.30
Those are just so important the way you view your troops.

2038
01:57:04.30 --> 01:57:06.30
Some people have a hard time with that.

2039
01:57:06.30 --> 01:57:12.10
Some people have a hard time with that.

2040
01:57:12.10 --> 01:57:17.46
Next section is called knowing your job.

2041
01:57:17.46 --> 01:57:25.30
In one of his little known passages, Robert Lewis Stevenson, Dr. Jackalomester Hyde,

2042
01:57:25.30 --> 01:57:31.18
and the perfect portrait of the man who finally failed in everything because he never

2043
01:57:31.18 --> 01:57:33.78
learned how to take hold of his work.

2044
01:57:33.78 --> 01:57:35.46
It goes like this.

2045
01:57:35.46 --> 01:57:39.78
His career was one of Unbroken Shame.

2046
01:57:39.78 --> 01:57:41.30
He did not drink.

2047
01:57:41.30 --> 01:57:42.82
He was exactly honest.

2048
01:57:42.82 --> 01:57:45.66
He was never rude to his employers.

2049
01:57:45.66 --> 01:57:48.94
He was everywhere discharged.

2050
01:57:48.94 --> 01:57:54.78
Bringing no interest to his duties, he brought no attention.

2051
01:57:54.78 --> 01:58:01.22
His day was a tissue of things neglected and things done a mess.

2052
01:58:01.22 --> 01:58:06.74
And from place to place and from town to town, he carried the character of one thoroughly

2053
01:58:06.74 --> 01:58:10.54
incompetent.

2054
01:58:10.54 --> 01:58:11.70
That's how we started this conversation.

2055
01:58:11.70 --> 01:58:15.02
Today we started talking about doing your job.

2056
01:58:15.02 --> 01:58:17.58
Now this is important.

2057
01:58:17.58 --> 01:58:23.70
Just as a rough approximation, any officers work week should comprise about 50% execution

2058
01:58:23.70 --> 01:58:30.10
and the other half study if he is to make the best use of his force.

2059
01:58:30.10 --> 01:58:35.82
The woods are loaded with go-getters who claim they are men of action and therefore have

2060
01:58:35.82 --> 01:58:38.06
no need of books.

2061
01:58:38.06 --> 01:58:40.10
We're talking about studying.

2062
01:58:40.10 --> 01:58:43.46
We're talking about reading and studying.

2063
01:58:43.46 --> 01:58:50.26
These guys that say that there's no need for books, they are of the same bone and marrow

2064
01:58:50.26 --> 01:58:55.30
as the drone who is always counseling half-speed.

2065
01:58:55.30 --> 01:58:56.50
Don't sweat.

2066
01:58:56.50 --> 01:58:57.74
Just get by.

2067
01:58:57.74 --> 01:58:59.42
Extra work means short life.

2068
01:58:59.42 --> 01:59:03.14
You're better off if they don't notice you.

2069
01:59:03.14 --> 01:59:06.18
This chant can be heard by anyone who cares to listen.

2070
01:59:06.18 --> 01:59:11.26
It's the old American invitation and mediocrity.

2071
01:59:11.26 --> 01:59:14.78
But not always them is to be found in books.

2072
01:59:14.78 --> 01:59:18.86
And at no time is this more true than when one is breaking in.

2073
01:59:18.86 --> 01:59:26.34
What is expected of any novice in any field is that he will ask questions.

2074
01:59:26.34 --> 01:59:30.90
Smart ones if possible, but if not, then questions of all kinds until he learns that there

2075
01:59:30.90 --> 01:59:35.26
is no such item as revely oil.

2076
01:59:35.26 --> 01:59:39.70
And that skirmish line doesn't come on spools.

2077
01:59:39.70 --> 01:59:43.26
So revely oil, revely is when you wake up in the morning.

2078
01:59:43.26 --> 01:59:46.26
And revely oil is something that doesn't actually exist.

2079
01:59:46.26 --> 01:59:49.30
But you'd say to a new guy, we need to get some revely oil for tomorrow.

2080
01:59:49.30 --> 01:59:50.74
Can you go down to supply and get it for me?

2081
01:59:50.74 --> 01:59:55.90
Or skirmish line to skirmish line is when you get online to engage the enemy.

2082
01:59:55.90 --> 01:59:57.94
Get online and put your guns in the same direction.

2083
01:59:57.94 --> 01:59:59.94
That's called a skirmish line.

2084
01:59:59.94 --> 02:00:02.26
Well, he said, hey, we need a spool, a skirmish line.

2085
02:00:02.26 --> 02:00:05.58
Echo, can you run down to the supply department and get us a roller skirmish line?

2086
02:00:05.58 --> 02:00:07.54
That's kind of like little practical jokes.

2087
02:00:07.54 --> 02:00:09.66
But his point is, here, people ask me to solve them.

2088
02:00:09.66 --> 02:00:10.66
Well, you know, I just checked in.

2089
02:00:10.66 --> 02:00:11.66
I'm just taking over as leader.

2090
02:00:11.66 --> 02:00:12.86
I'm just, you know, I'm a new officer.

2091
02:00:12.86 --> 02:00:13.86
I'm getting commissioned.

2092
02:00:13.86 --> 02:00:14.86
What should I do?

2093
02:00:14.86 --> 02:00:15.86
How should I lead?

2094
02:00:15.86 --> 02:00:16.86
Ask questions.

2095
02:00:16.86 --> 02:00:17.50
There's nothing wrong with it.

2096
02:00:17.50 --> 02:00:21.30
There's nothing wrong with it.

2097
02:00:21.30 --> 02:00:22.30
Back to the book.

2098
02:00:22.30 --> 02:00:30.38
Wisdom begins at the point of understanding that there is nothing shameful about ignorance.

2099
02:00:30.38 --> 02:00:35.70
It is shameful only when a man would rather remain in that state than cultivate other

2100
02:00:35.70 --> 02:00:37.46
men's knowledge.

2101
02:00:37.46 --> 02:00:42.78
There is never any reason why he should hesitate for his better to be embarrassed from seeking

2102
02:00:42.78 --> 02:00:51.06
counsel than to be found short for not having sought it.

2103
02:00:51.06 --> 02:00:56.78
Ideally, any officer should be able to do the work of any man under him.

2104
02:00:56.78 --> 02:01:03.34
However, it is obviously absurd to expect that any officer could know more about radio repair

2105
02:01:03.34 --> 02:01:04.66
than his repairman.

2106
02:01:04.66 --> 02:01:13.30
For about mapping than his cartographical section, more about moving parts than a gunsmith,

2107
02:01:13.30 --> 02:01:20.38
more about radar than a specialist in electronics, and more about cipher than a cryptographer.

2108
02:01:20.38 --> 02:01:24.74
The distinction lies in the difference between the power to do a thing well and that of

2109
02:01:24.74 --> 02:01:28.26
being able to judge when it is done well.

2110
02:01:28.26 --> 02:01:33.34
A man can say a book is bad, though not knowing how to write one himself provided he

2111
02:01:33.34 --> 02:01:39.58
is a student of literature, though he is never laid in egg he can pass fair judgment

2112
02:01:39.58 --> 02:01:42.94
on an omelet.

2113
02:01:42.94 --> 02:01:46.70
So this is another thing, you know, you're not going to know everything as a leader.

2114
02:01:46.70 --> 02:01:52.66
You know, that I know as much about sniper, sniping as my sniper did I even know close.

2115
02:01:52.66 --> 02:01:56.90
You know, that I know as much about, just like he said, I was much about the radio, is

2116
02:01:56.90 --> 02:01:57.90
my radio-mended?

2117
02:01:57.90 --> 02:02:01.78
No, no, close to what they knew.

2118
02:02:01.78 --> 02:02:05.46
You don't need to know everything, but you have to have an understanding of it.

2119
02:02:05.46 --> 02:02:12.98
And you have to at least be able to understand that something is being done right or wrong.

2120
02:02:12.98 --> 02:02:14.10
This is another good point.

2121
02:02:14.10 --> 02:02:19.30
We can ponder the words of William Hazlet, a man who shrinks from a collision with his

2122
02:02:19.30 --> 02:02:23.90
equals of superiors will soon sink below himself.

2123
02:02:23.90 --> 02:02:30.58
We improve by trying our strength with others, not by showing it off.

2124
02:02:30.58 --> 02:02:33.78
So you can't be afraid to bring stuff up to your superiors.

2125
02:02:33.78 --> 02:02:34.78
Do you got to be respectful?

2126
02:02:34.78 --> 02:02:36.70
Yes, you do.

2127
02:02:36.70 --> 02:02:41.82
But instead of just being a yes man, don't be that.

2128
02:02:41.82 --> 02:02:48.26
Now this next section.

2129
02:02:48.26 --> 02:02:52.58
It's called writing and speaking.

2130
02:02:52.58 --> 02:02:57.90
Other things being equal a superior rating will invariably be given to the officer who

2131
02:02:57.90 --> 02:03:03.50
is preserved in his studies of the art of self-expression.

2132
02:03:03.50 --> 02:03:07.82
While his colleague who attaches little importance to what may be achieved through working

2133
02:03:07.82 --> 02:03:12.22
with the language will be marked for mediocrity.

2134
02:03:12.22 --> 02:03:17.78
So we're talking about reading and speaking, writing and speaking.

2135
02:03:17.78 --> 02:03:25.38
As the British statesman does Rayleigh put it, men govern with words.

2136
02:03:25.38 --> 02:03:31.78
Within the military establishment command is exercised through what is said, which commands

2137
02:03:31.78 --> 02:03:39.50
attention and understanding and through what is written, which directs, explains, interprets

2138
02:03:39.50 --> 02:03:42.02
or informs.

2139
02:03:42.02 --> 02:03:49.94
Battles are one through the ability of men to express concrete ideas in clear and unmistakable

2140
02:03:49.94 --> 02:03:54.90
language.

2141
02:03:54.90 --> 02:03:59.26
Battles are one through clear and unmistakable language.

2142
02:03:59.26 --> 02:04:01.22
That's how battles are one.

2143
02:04:01.22 --> 02:04:05.86
Back to the book, all administration is carried forward along the chain of command by the

2144
02:04:05.86 --> 02:04:12.50
power of men to make their thoughts articulate and available to others.

2145
02:04:12.50 --> 02:04:19.06
There is no way under the sun that this basic condition can be altered.

2146
02:04:19.06 --> 02:04:23.18
Once the point is granted, any officer should be ready to accept its corollary.

2147
02:04:23.18 --> 02:04:28.66
That superior qualification in the use of language both as to the written and the spoken

2148
02:04:28.66 --> 02:04:34.58
word is more essential to military leadership than knowledge of the whole technique of weapons

2149
02:04:34.58 --> 02:04:38.38
handling.

2150
02:04:38.38 --> 02:04:43.18
So when people ask me why I studied English in college, this is why I studied English

2151
02:04:43.18 --> 02:04:47.78
in college.

2152
02:04:47.78 --> 02:04:53.78
Some men will take refuge in the excuse offered by the great majority.

2153
02:04:53.78 --> 02:04:59.62
I'm just a simple fighting file with no gift for writing or speaking.

2154
02:04:59.62 --> 02:05:05.86
That is the mark of an officer who has no ambition to properly qualify himself and is seeking

2155
02:05:05.86 --> 02:05:11.14
to justify his own laziness.

2156
02:05:11.14 --> 02:05:16.22
And the reason he's saying that is because he thinks that you can become a good writer.

2157
02:05:16.22 --> 02:05:19.82
Back to the book, writers are self-made.

2158
02:05:19.82 --> 02:05:25.74
But it is a reasonable speculation that history might never have heard of the greater number

2159
02:05:25.74 --> 02:05:27.66
of these men.

2160
02:05:27.66 --> 02:05:38.14
Had they not worked sedulously to become proficient with the pen as well as with the sword.

2161
02:05:38.14 --> 02:05:43.86
Men who command words to serve their thoughts and feelings are well on their way to

2162
02:05:43.86 --> 02:05:47.22
commanding men to serve their purposes.

2163
02:05:47.22 --> 02:05:54.86
All senior commanders respect the junior who has a faculty for thinking and idea through

2164
02:05:54.86 --> 02:05:59.38
and then expressing it comprehensively and clear, unvarnished phases.

2165
02:05:59.38 --> 02:06:06.26
So your young young leader out there, young trooper, think about improving your method

2166
02:06:06.26 --> 02:06:12.58
of thought, think about making your speech more clear.

2167
02:06:12.58 --> 02:06:18.94
Many men who has the brain to qualify for commission can make of himself a competent writer.

2168
02:06:18.94 --> 02:06:23.26
Because of natural limitations, he may never excel in this art, but if he has had average

2169
02:06:23.26 --> 02:06:27.78
schooling, knows how to open a dictionary, can find his way to the library and is willing

2170
02:06:27.78 --> 02:06:33.26
to commit himself to long study and practice, particularly in non-duty hours, and will

2171
02:06:33.26 --> 02:06:38.66
finally free himself from the superstition that writing is a game only for specialists.

2172
02:06:38.66 --> 02:06:44.06
He can acquire all the skill that is necessary to further his advance within the military

2173
02:06:44.06 --> 02:06:46.50
profession.

2174
02:06:46.50 --> 02:06:51.78
But where should work begin, how about a little practical advice?

2175
02:06:51.78 --> 02:06:56.98
The only way to learn to write is to write.

2176
02:06:56.98 --> 02:06:58.26
That's it.

2177
02:06:58.26 --> 02:07:05.10
There's no other secret, other than hard, unremitting practice.

2178
02:07:05.10 --> 02:07:10.34
Most writers at the start are mentally muscle bound and poorly coordinated.

2179
02:07:10.34 --> 02:07:13.06
They have thoughts in their head.

2180
02:07:13.06 --> 02:07:18.06
They think they can develop them clearly, but when they try to apply a largely dormant

2181
02:07:18.06 --> 02:07:24.38
vocabulary to the expression of these thoughts, the result is stiff and self-conscious.

2182
02:07:24.38 --> 02:07:25.94
Self-conscious.

2183
02:07:25.94 --> 02:07:33.30
The only cure for this is constant mental exercise with one's pen or over one's type

2184
02:07:33.30 --> 02:07:35.90
writer.

2185
02:07:35.90 --> 02:07:41.98
The discipline, through which one learns to write adds substance to thought, whereby one's

2186
02:07:41.98 --> 02:07:46.46
ideas are given body and connection.

2187
02:07:46.46 --> 02:07:52.22
Such common faults as worreness over statement, faulty sentence structure and weak

2188
02:07:52.22 --> 02:08:00.10
use of words are gradually corrected with their passing confidence grows.

2189
02:08:00.10 --> 02:08:05.54
This does not mean however that the task becomes easy.

2190
02:08:05.54 --> 02:08:08.02
So you can get better this game.

2191
02:08:08.02 --> 02:08:09.02
You just got to practice.

2192
02:08:09.02 --> 02:08:10.26
Kind of like getting better at pull ups.

2193
02:08:10.26 --> 02:08:11.26
I get better at pull ups.

2194
02:08:11.26 --> 02:08:12.26
Do pull ups.

2195
02:08:12.26 --> 02:08:13.26
Do pull ups.

2196
02:08:13.26 --> 02:08:14.26
Now this is interesting.

2197
02:08:14.26 --> 02:08:18.54
Speaking of reading and or speaking of writing, now we get into reading a little bit

2198
02:08:18.54 --> 02:08:20.10
here.

2199
02:08:20.10 --> 02:08:22.50
This is good.

2200
02:08:22.50 --> 02:08:26.90
It is a good habit to underscore passages and books which have contributed something

2201
02:08:26.90 --> 02:08:29.58
vital to one's own thought.

2202
02:08:29.58 --> 02:08:32.42
Break out the high lighters.

2203
02:08:32.42 --> 02:08:37.74
I kind of laughed when I read that because I have a lot of high lighters.

2204
02:08:37.74 --> 02:08:40.50
I think you went winchester on a couple of days.

2205
02:08:40.50 --> 02:08:44.30
Yeah, that's right.

2206
02:08:44.30 --> 02:08:47.98
Now this is talking about going back to writing again as a practical matter is better to concentrate

2207
02:08:47.98 --> 02:08:53.30
on a few elementary rules of thumb, such as our contained in the following list, then

2208
02:08:53.30 --> 02:09:00.18
to bog down attempting to heed everything that the pendants have said about how to become a writer.

2209
02:09:00.18 --> 02:09:05.06
So here's some advice on writing and you'll notice that these are good advice on life.

2210
02:09:05.06 --> 02:09:10.98
The more simply a thing is said, the more powerfully it influences those who read.

2211
02:09:10.98 --> 02:09:14.34
Plain words make strong writing.

2212
02:09:14.34 --> 02:09:19.54
There is always one best word to convey a thought or a feeling, to accept the weaker

2213
02:09:19.54 --> 02:09:27.26
substitute rather than to search for the right word will deprive any writing of force.

2214
02:09:27.26 --> 02:09:32.78
Economy of words in the great composition.

2215
02:09:32.78 --> 02:09:38.02
In all writing but in military writing particularly, there is no excuse for vague terminology

2216
02:09:38.02 --> 02:09:44.62
or phrases which do not convey an exact expression of what was done or what is intended.

2217
02:09:44.62 --> 02:09:49.70
And just think about how you communicate with your subordinates and think about these rules.

2218
02:09:49.70 --> 02:09:52.98
So impactful.

2219
02:09:52.98 --> 02:09:53.98
This is a good one.

2220
02:09:53.98 --> 02:09:57.70
It is better at all times to reign in.

2221
02:09:57.70 --> 02:10:02.42
The strength of military writing like the soundness of military operations does not gain

2222
02:10:02.42 --> 02:10:06.26
through overstatement and artificial coloring.

2223
02:10:06.26 --> 02:10:12.14
The bigger the subject, the less it needs in pro-eatery.

2224
02:10:12.14 --> 02:10:19.42
Now, it's going to start talking here, go from talking about writing to talk about speaking.

2225
02:10:19.42 --> 02:10:24.86
A majority of the world's most gifted writers would in all probability be dumbstruck

2226
02:10:24.86 --> 02:10:27.66
if put before an audience.

2227
02:10:27.66 --> 02:10:34.06
Though dealing confidently with ideas, they lack the confidence when dealing with people.

2228
02:10:34.06 --> 02:10:40.30
The military officer has need of both talents and as to where the accent should be placed

2229
02:10:40.30 --> 02:10:46.58
to this probably more important that he should speak well than his writing prose should

2230
02:10:46.58 --> 02:10:49.86
be polished.

2231
02:10:49.86 --> 02:10:54.50
A unit commander may permit a clerk or a subordinate to do the greater part of his paperwork,

2232
02:10:54.50 --> 02:10:58.82
either because his own time is taken with other duties or because he is awkward at it.

2233
02:10:58.82 --> 02:11:04.02
But if he permits any other voice to dominate the councils of the organization, he soon

2234
02:11:04.02 --> 02:11:09.10
ceases to exercise moral authority over it.

2235
02:11:09.10 --> 02:11:12.78
So you gotta be confident in your speaking.

2236
02:11:12.78 --> 02:11:16.70
A little bit more important than the writing because you can have your guys do some writing.

2237
02:11:16.70 --> 02:11:17.70
Yeah, I'll sign it.

2238
02:11:17.70 --> 02:11:19.70
Looks good to me.

2239
02:11:19.70 --> 02:11:24.38
This guy, one of the bosses I had.

2240
02:11:24.38 --> 02:11:29.54
So he'd always misuse words, almost to the point where you know how some comedians will

2241
02:11:29.54 --> 02:11:30.94
do that, like he'll misuse.

2242
02:11:30.94 --> 02:11:35.46
He notch does that a lot of time, but this guy would for real do it.

2243
02:11:35.46 --> 02:11:41.34
But you know what it was, is you know how the guy who's, they want to try to sound smart

2244
02:11:41.34 --> 02:11:44.70
basically and got a good idea.

2245
02:11:44.70 --> 02:11:48.02
Like, so he would use the word like irregardless.

2246
02:11:48.02 --> 02:11:50.82
He would say irregardless, this is a supposed to regardless.

2247
02:11:50.82 --> 02:11:55.42
And then there's another one that it's so funny because it was so counterproductive because

2248
02:11:55.42 --> 02:11:58.78
when he would talk and we'd all be holding in our laughter and I'd work with this other

2249
02:11:58.78 --> 02:11:59.78
guy.

2250
02:11:59.78 --> 02:12:03.38
He was a kind of relentless jokes, you know, when you're gone.

2251
02:12:03.38 --> 02:12:07.94
So if you did something and in this case you'd misuse words or when he leaves brother jokes

2252
02:12:07.94 --> 02:12:09.46
would come and it'd be just so funny.

2253
02:12:09.46 --> 02:12:13.18
But nonetheless he would use behoof, you know, behoof.

2254
02:12:13.18 --> 02:12:14.18
It would behoof.

2255
02:12:14.18 --> 02:12:15.54
Yeah, here's a behoof.

2256
02:12:15.54 --> 02:12:20.18
I think it is behoof, but you're right, because that's what I thought anyway, that's

2257
02:12:20.18 --> 02:12:21.18
a whole lot of thing.

2258
02:12:21.18 --> 02:12:22.82
But anyway, behoof then.

2259
02:12:22.82 --> 02:12:24.58
So he would misuse that word.

2260
02:12:24.58 --> 02:12:29.34
He would, he thought it meant what, he thought it meant baffling.

2261
02:12:29.34 --> 02:12:33.26
Like, you know what really behoves me is that they do it this way.

2262
02:12:33.26 --> 02:12:35.78
And then he keep doing it, you know.

2263
02:12:35.78 --> 02:12:41.10
And so anyway, the point there is where you kind of, you got to know how to talk, right?

2264
02:12:41.10 --> 02:12:46.82
So, and in this case, this was, this wasn't like some high levels like speeches he was

2265
02:12:46.82 --> 02:12:48.62
making or addressed the game.

2266
02:12:48.62 --> 02:12:50.78
It was just like normal stuff.

2267
02:12:50.78 --> 02:12:56.74
So right, I thought that that was kind of critical in the way we regarded him as a part.

2268
02:12:56.74 --> 02:13:01.78
That was one of the major things where we can't even take this guy seriously.

2269
02:13:01.78 --> 02:13:04.02
Yeah, because he be hoofs me with everything.

2270
02:13:04.02 --> 02:13:06.02
He was really be hoofing.

2271
02:13:06.02 --> 02:13:09.02
He was like, oh, you're wrong usage.

2272
02:13:09.02 --> 02:13:10.02
It's okay, people.

2273
02:13:10.02 --> 02:13:11.02
Yeah, it's not okay.

2274
02:13:11.02 --> 02:13:17.30
I guess the point there, a Nora separate point is learn the words, be free, start trying

2275
02:13:17.30 --> 02:13:19.54
to throw them out, I guess.

2276
02:13:19.54 --> 02:13:20.70
And that goes, that would be your scene.

2277
02:13:20.70 --> 02:13:25.86
That would be very, yeah, that would be who, what you're saying about, it's better to

2278
02:13:25.86 --> 02:13:32.18
seek the knowledge and be embarrassed because you got to seek to rather than get it called

2279
02:13:32.18 --> 02:13:34.18
out when you don't know it or whatever.

2280
02:13:34.18 --> 02:13:38.82
Anyway, the opportunity was to.

2281
02:13:38.82 --> 02:13:45.26
Back to the book, the matter of nerve is a main element in speaking.

2282
02:13:45.26 --> 02:13:49.86
When an officer is ill at ease, fidgety and not to the point, the vote of his command for

2283
02:13:49.86 --> 02:13:53.26
the time being is no confidence.

2284
02:13:53.26 --> 02:13:56.98
And so long as he remains that way, they will not change.

2285
02:13:56.98 --> 02:14:02.18
No matter though, his good will shines for through another acts.

2286
02:14:02.18 --> 02:14:06.62
So that's what you just said, if someone's jacked up when they're trying to talk to you

2287
02:14:06.62 --> 02:14:09.18
and talk to the group, your vote is no confidence.

2288
02:14:09.18 --> 02:14:13.02
Yeah, that's a constant vote.

2289
02:14:13.02 --> 02:14:17.58
As for this is a good, back to the book.

2290
02:14:17.58 --> 02:14:23.10
As for how an officer should talk to his men, his manner in tone should be no different

2291
02:14:23.10 --> 02:14:27.82
than if he were addressing his fellow officers or for that matter, a group of the intellectual

2292
02:14:27.82 --> 02:14:31.42
and political peers from any walk of life.

2293
02:14:31.42 --> 02:14:34.22
If he is stuffy, he will not succeed.

2294
02:14:34.22 --> 02:14:40.62
If he affects a superior manner, that is a mark of his inferiority.

2295
02:14:40.62 --> 02:14:46.70
If he is patronizing and talks to grown men as a teacher might talk to a class of adolescence,

2296
02:14:46.70 --> 02:14:52.58
the rug figuratively will be pulled out from under him.

2297
02:14:52.58 --> 02:14:56.58
His audience will put down what put him down as a chump.

2298
02:14:56.58 --> 02:15:00.94
It is curiously the case that the junior officer who can't get the right pitch when he

2299
02:15:00.94 --> 02:15:06.50
talks to the ranks will also be out of tune when he talks to his superiors.

2300
02:15:06.50 --> 02:15:13.18
This failing is a sign mainly that he needs practice in the school of human nature.

2301
02:15:13.18 --> 02:15:22.74
I listening a little more carefully to other men, he may find himself in time, attain maturity.

2302
02:15:22.74 --> 02:15:26.94
Another good way to get better at speaking is by listening.

2303
02:15:26.94 --> 02:15:31.50
No doubt.

2304
02:15:31.50 --> 02:15:36.94
When you're speaking sometimes you're instructing in one of the pieces here is called the

2305
02:15:36.94 --> 02:15:41.94
Art of Instruction because you spend so much time when you're in a leadership position.

2306
02:15:41.94 --> 02:15:44.82
You're instructing people whether you realize you're instructing people.

2307
02:15:44.82 --> 02:15:46.46
Here's the rules that they say to follow.

2308
02:15:46.46 --> 02:15:47.86
Keep it simple.

2309
02:15:47.86 --> 02:15:54.14
Have one main object, stay on the course, remain cheerful, be enthusiastic, put it out

2310
02:15:54.14 --> 02:16:02.46
as if the ideas were as interesting and novel to you as to your audience.

2311
02:16:02.46 --> 02:16:06.02
This is a story which really doesn't know what has to do with instruction, but it's

2312
02:16:06.02 --> 02:16:10.34
cool stories from the reading anyways because it's just badass.

2313
02:16:10.34 --> 02:16:15.26
In World War I, the American major, named now long forgotten was given the task of making

2314
02:16:15.26 --> 02:16:21.94
the rounds and talking to all combat formations and convincing them that the future was bright.

2315
02:16:21.94 --> 02:16:22.94
No boy scout Aaron.

2316
02:16:22.94 --> 02:16:24.98
So you imagine your world war one.

2317
02:16:24.98 --> 02:16:26.98
We've talked about that.

2318
02:16:26.98 --> 02:16:32.66
It's a nightmare in his job as to go around and ensure people that the future is bright.

2319
02:16:32.66 --> 02:16:36.78
But wherever he went, morale was lifted by his words.

2320
02:16:36.78 --> 02:16:41.58
And substance, in substance, what he said was this.

2321
02:16:41.58 --> 02:16:46.54
None of us cares about making a living with any individuals who wants every break his own

2322
02:16:46.54 --> 02:16:47.54
way.

2323
02:16:47.54 --> 02:16:52.78
But when the odds are even, the gamble is worth any good man's time.

2324
02:16:52.78 --> 02:16:55.46
So let's look at the proportion.

2325
02:16:55.46 --> 02:16:58.42
You now have one chance and two.

2326
02:16:58.42 --> 02:17:01.02
You may go overseas or you may not.

2327
02:17:01.02 --> 02:17:02.34
Suppose you do.

2328
02:17:02.34 --> 02:17:03.94
You still have one chance and two.

2329
02:17:03.94 --> 02:17:06.42
You may go to the front or you may not.

2330
02:17:06.42 --> 02:17:09.86
If you don't, you'll see a foreign country at Uncle Sam's expense.

2331
02:17:09.86 --> 02:17:16.50
If you do, you'll find out about war, which is the toughest chance of them all.

2332
02:17:16.50 --> 02:17:21.10
But up there, on the front, you still have one chance and two.

2333
02:17:21.10 --> 02:17:24.26
You may get hit or you may not.

2334
02:17:24.26 --> 02:17:29.86
If you breeze through it, you'll be a better man for all the rest of your life.

2335
02:17:29.86 --> 02:17:34.66
And if you get hit, you still have one chance and two.

2336
02:17:34.66 --> 02:17:41.02
You may get a small wound and become a hero to your friends and family.

2337
02:17:41.02 --> 02:17:46.26
Or there is always the last chance that it may take you out all together.

2338
02:17:46.26 --> 02:17:52.30
And while that is a little rugged, it is at least worth remembering that very few people

2339
02:17:52.30 --> 02:17:56.74
seem to get out of this life alive.

2340
02:17:56.74 --> 02:17:58.62
Classic.

2341
02:17:58.62 --> 02:18:02.10
Classic.

2342
02:18:02.10 --> 02:18:10.02
Now talking about reading Napoleon once said that the point that a trouble with books

2343
02:18:10.02 --> 02:18:14.58
is that one must read so many bad ones to find something really good.

2344
02:18:14.58 --> 02:18:15.58
True enough.

2345
02:18:15.58 --> 02:18:20.46
But even so, there are perfectly practical ways to advance rapidly without undue-waste

2346
02:18:20.46 --> 02:18:21.86
emotion.

2347
02:18:21.86 --> 02:18:25.46
Consider this, among one's superiors, there are always discriminating men who have

2348
02:18:25.46 --> 02:18:30.42
adopted a few good books after reading many, many bad ones.

2349
02:18:30.42 --> 02:18:37.02
And they say that a text is worthwhile, it deserves reading and careful study.

2350
02:18:37.02 --> 02:18:41.38
So, what books did somebody you respect read?

2351
02:18:41.38 --> 02:18:43.14
They said it's good book, read it.

2352
02:18:43.14 --> 02:18:52.30
Now you gotta be careful because the well-read man need not have more than a dozen books

2353
02:18:52.30 --> 02:18:55.42
in his home provided that they all count with him.

2354
02:18:55.42 --> 02:18:59.78
And he continues to pull over them and ponder the weight of what is said.

2355
02:18:59.78 --> 02:19:05.98
On the other hand, the ignorant man is frequently marked by his bookshelf stocked with titles

2356
02:19:05.98 --> 02:19:11.46
not one of which suggests that he has any professional discernment.

2357
02:19:11.46 --> 02:19:17.06
Now I can tell you right now, I'm building a library of books that's kind of crazy

2358
02:19:17.06 --> 02:19:23.50
because every time somebody hits me up on social media and says, hey, you gotta shout

2359
02:19:23.50 --> 02:19:24.50
this book.

2360
02:19:24.50 --> 02:19:27.66
I used to go on Amazon and kind of look at read reviews now.

2361
02:19:27.66 --> 02:19:28.66
I just wore a grit.

2362
02:19:28.66 --> 02:19:33.62
I mean, basically order it because I don't have time and it's hard to tell from the reviews

2363
02:19:33.62 --> 02:19:34.94
and it takes much time.

2364
02:19:34.94 --> 02:19:37.22
It's easier just to push click by now.

2365
02:19:37.22 --> 02:19:38.22
Yeah.

2366
02:19:38.22 --> 02:19:41.34
Amazon, I'm clicking through the Jockel Podcast Store website.

2367
02:19:41.34 --> 02:19:45.22
So we're giving back to the podcast.

2368
02:19:45.22 --> 02:19:49.18
But the thing is, a lot of people might think this book is great.

2369
02:19:49.18 --> 02:19:53.86
All this to be a great book, but it doesn't quite work.

2370
02:19:53.86 --> 02:19:57.70
So I'm probably getting, I'd say one out of every five books that I ordered to

2371
02:19:57.70 --> 02:20:00.46
say, yeah, this one's this one's game.

2372
02:20:00.46 --> 02:20:01.46
Yeah.

2373
02:20:01.46 --> 02:20:06.90
What he's saying there about the difference between somebody who was a huge stock

2374
02:20:06.90 --> 02:20:11.78
of books is he's saying like a variety of different books that doesn't, it's

2375
02:20:11.78 --> 02:20:14.62
something but not indicating any kind of expertise or something.

2376
02:20:14.62 --> 02:20:17.86
It just says he just shows that he doesn't have any discernment.

2377
02:20:17.86 --> 02:20:19.26
This guy just buying a bunch of books.

2378
02:20:19.26 --> 02:20:20.54
He might not know anything about him.

2379
02:20:20.54 --> 02:20:23.26
It doesn't mean it don't touch a book by its cover.

2380
02:20:23.26 --> 02:20:24.26
Pond intended.

2381
02:20:24.26 --> 02:20:25.78
You know, just because this guy's got a bunch of books.

2382
02:20:25.78 --> 02:20:30.30
It doesn't mean that he's read them all doesn't mean that he actually, they're all

2383
02:20:30.30 --> 02:20:31.30
great books.

2384
02:20:31.30 --> 02:20:32.30
Really?

2385
02:20:32.30 --> 02:20:34.34
I can tell you right now, they're not long-grain books in the world.

2386
02:20:34.34 --> 02:20:35.34
Yeah.

2387
02:20:35.34 --> 02:20:36.34
A lot of books are not good.

2388
02:20:36.34 --> 02:20:38.42
And you shouldn't waste your time reading them.

2389
02:20:38.42 --> 02:20:42.62
But if you walked into a guy that was smart that you were speculated 12 books, I would

2390
02:20:42.62 --> 02:20:44.30
just write them all down and go buy them all.

2391
02:20:44.30 --> 02:20:45.30
Yeah.

2392
02:20:45.30 --> 02:20:47.06
And you're probably going to be 10 for 12 for 12.

2393
02:20:47.06 --> 02:20:48.06
Yeah.

2394
02:20:48.06 --> 02:20:49.22
Or at least 10 for 12.

2395
02:20:49.22 --> 02:20:54.30
Whereas if I go into your room and you've got 570 books in there, yeah.

2396
02:20:54.30 --> 02:20:56.06
These are all great books.

2397
02:20:56.06 --> 02:20:57.26
There's something wrong with your discernment.

2398
02:20:57.26 --> 02:20:59.06
You don't know what a good book is.

2399
02:20:59.06 --> 02:21:00.06
Yeah.

2400
02:21:00.06 --> 02:21:01.54
So get some discernment.

2401
02:21:01.54 --> 02:21:03.54
Or I'm just trying to make like I read so much.

2402
02:21:03.54 --> 02:21:09.26
You're going to make 570 books.

2403
02:21:09.26 --> 02:21:15.30
This section, your relationships with your men.

2404
02:21:15.30 --> 02:21:16.30
And I had to break.

2405
02:21:16.30 --> 02:21:17.50
I had to say this part.

2406
02:21:17.50 --> 02:21:22.22
And officers not expected to appear all wise to those who serve under him.

2407
02:21:22.22 --> 02:21:24.98
So often guys feel that pressure that they think they should know everything.

2408
02:21:24.98 --> 02:21:25.98
Yeah.

2409
02:21:25.98 --> 02:21:26.98
Oh my gosh.

2410
02:21:26.98 --> 02:21:27.98
I don't know if I admit that.

2411
02:21:27.98 --> 02:21:28.98
I don't know this.

2412
02:21:28.98 --> 02:21:29.98
I'm going to look bad.

2413
02:21:29.98 --> 02:21:34.46
Bluffing ones away through a question when ignorant of the answer is full-hardy business.

2414
02:21:34.46 --> 02:21:35.66
I'm sorry, but I don't know.

2415
02:21:35.66 --> 02:21:39.06
It's just as appropriate from an officer's lips is from any other.

2416
02:21:39.06 --> 02:21:44.22
And it helps a little more to add, but I'll find out.

2417
02:21:44.22 --> 02:21:47.46
Rank should be used to serve one's subordinates.

2418
02:21:47.46 --> 02:21:51.82
It should never be flaunted or used to get the upper hand of a subordinate any situation

2419
02:21:51.82 --> 02:21:59.42
safe where he has already discredited himself in an unusually ugly or unseemingly manner.

2420
02:21:59.42 --> 02:22:03.46
When suggestions from any subordinate are adopted, the credits should be passed on to him

2421
02:22:03.46 --> 02:22:05.10
publicly.

2422
02:22:05.10 --> 02:22:10.14
When a subordinate is made a mistake, but not from any lack of good will, it is common

2423
02:22:10.14 --> 02:22:15.90
sense to take the rap for him rather than make him suffer doubly for his error.

2424
02:22:15.90 --> 02:22:20.18
An officer should not issue orders which he cannot enforce.

2425
02:22:20.18 --> 02:22:25.82
He should be as good as his word at all times and in any circumstance.

2426
02:22:25.82 --> 02:22:29.18
He should promise nothing which he cannot make stick.

2427
02:22:29.18 --> 02:22:33.82
An officer should not work looking over his men's shoulders, checking on every detail of what

2428
02:22:33.82 --> 02:22:40.02
they're doing and calling them to account at every furlong past.

2429
02:22:40.02 --> 02:22:46.54
This made and lead attitude corrode confidence and destroys initiatives so don't micromanage.

2430
02:22:46.54 --> 02:22:52.34
On the other hand, contact is necessary at all times, particularly when men are doing long-term

2431
02:22:52.34 --> 02:22:55.78
work or operating in a detachment at a remote point.

2432
02:22:55.78 --> 02:22:59.38
They will become discouraged and will lose their sense of direction unless their superior

2433
02:22:59.38 --> 02:23:02.22
looks in on them periodically.

2434
02:23:02.22 --> 02:23:08.14
Ask them whether he can be of any help and so doing gets them to open up the discussion

2435
02:23:08.14 --> 02:23:11.26
and the problem.

2436
02:23:11.26 --> 02:23:16.06
The Navy says this is another good one right here.

2437
02:23:16.06 --> 02:23:21.78
The Navy says it isn't courtesy to change the set of the sale within 30 minutes after

2438
02:23:21.78 --> 02:23:23.78
the relief of watch.

2439
02:23:23.78 --> 02:23:28.50
Applied to command job this means that it is a mistake for an officer on taking a new

2440
02:23:28.50 --> 02:23:32.38
post to order sweeping changes affecting the other men.

2441
02:23:32.38 --> 02:23:37.14
In the belief that this will give a reputation for action and firmness.

2442
02:23:37.14 --> 02:23:43.46
The studying of the situation is the overture of the setting of it.

2443
02:23:43.46 --> 02:23:49.18
The story is told of Curtis E. Lamay of the Air Force taking over the 21st bomber

2444
02:23:49.18 --> 02:23:51.46
command and the Mariana's.

2445
02:23:51.46 --> 02:23:57.42
He faced the worried staff officers of his predecessor and said quietly, you're all

2446
02:23:57.42 --> 02:23:58.42
staying put.

2447
02:23:58.42 --> 02:24:03.62
I assume you know your jobs or you wouldn't be here.

2448
02:24:03.62 --> 02:24:04.62
Pretty simple.

2449
02:24:04.62 --> 02:24:06.62
Then people always ask, come into a new year.

2450
02:24:06.62 --> 02:24:08.18
What do I do when I take over?

2451
02:24:08.18 --> 02:24:09.18
Relax.

2452
02:24:09.18 --> 02:24:10.18
Be humble.

2453
02:24:10.18 --> 02:24:11.18
Listen.

2454
02:24:11.18 --> 02:24:12.18
Observe.

2455
02:24:12.18 --> 02:24:13.18
Don't need to jump in there and change the set of the sale.

2456
02:24:13.18 --> 02:24:14.18
All right, echo's gone now.

2457
02:24:14.18 --> 02:24:15.18
I'm in charge.

2458
02:24:15.18 --> 02:24:16.18
Change everything.

2459
02:24:16.18 --> 02:24:20.22
No, wrong answer.

2460
02:24:20.22 --> 02:24:25.06
This next section, your men's moral and physical welfare.

2461
02:24:25.06 --> 02:24:30.10
When men are moral, the moral power which binds them together and fits them for high

2462
02:24:30.10 --> 02:24:37.18
action is given its main chance for success.

2463
02:24:37.18 --> 02:24:40.02
Now listen to these.

2464
02:24:40.02 --> 02:24:45.74
To be temperate and all things, to be content and refrain from loose living of any sort

2465
02:24:45.74 --> 02:24:48.26
are acts of the will.

2466
02:24:48.26 --> 02:24:54.58
They require self-denial and are forgoing of that which may be more attractive in favor

2467
02:24:54.58 --> 02:24:58.58
of the thing which should be done.

2468
02:24:58.58 --> 02:25:02.18
Granted there are few individuals who are so thin blooded that they never feel tempted to

2469
02:25:02.18 --> 02:25:05.18
digress morally.

2470
02:25:05.18 --> 02:25:07.18
Men in the majority are not like that.

2471
02:25:07.18 --> 02:25:09.30
So there's some guys that just on the straight narrow.

2472
02:25:09.30 --> 02:25:14.58
They're so thin blooded that they just get no temptations.

2473
02:25:14.58 --> 02:25:16.94
Most men, they get temptations.

2474
02:25:16.94 --> 02:25:22.78
What they were now in the name of self-discipline at the cost of a considerably and considerable

2475
02:25:22.78 --> 02:25:28.98
interest, they endeavored to compensate by gains in their personal character.

2476
02:25:28.98 --> 02:25:36.98
Making that grade isn't easy, but no one who is anyone has yet said that it isn't worthwhile.

2477
02:25:36.98 --> 02:25:41.50
In the armed services they're an old saying that an officer without character is more useless

2478
02:25:41.50 --> 02:25:44.34
than a ship with no bottom.

2479
02:25:44.34 --> 02:25:51.10
In summing up the strength of will, which enables a man to lead a clean life is no different

2480
02:25:51.10 --> 02:25:57.86
than the strength of purpose which fits him to follow a hard line of duty.

2481
02:25:57.86 --> 02:25:59.54
There are exceptions to every rule.

2482
02:25:59.54 --> 02:26:05.06
Many a lovable rounder has proved himself to be a first class fighting man.

2483
02:26:05.06 --> 02:26:11.06
But even though he had an uncorcoable weakness for drinking women, his resolution had

2484
02:26:11.06 --> 02:26:18.74
to become steeled along some other line or he would have been no good when the payoff came.

2485
02:26:18.74 --> 02:26:24.90
So this is saying that the strength of will that it takes to stay strong in all these

2486
02:26:24.90 --> 02:26:31.98
situations, all these temptations that will is real and that can transfer over.

2487
02:26:31.98 --> 02:26:38.46
Now I can tell you that this one is there's all the militaries filled.

2488
02:26:38.46 --> 02:26:42.22
He says many a lovable rounder has proved himself to be a first class fighting man.

2489
02:26:42.22 --> 02:26:48.50
Of course, guys, they're bad ass guys throughout the ages that were even Henry the

2490
02:26:48.50 --> 02:26:51.02
fifth out of wild man reputation.

2491
02:26:51.02 --> 02:26:56.50
Going back to Shakespeare.

2492
02:26:56.50 --> 02:27:04.74
So, but he's saying that these staying on the straight narrow enforces your will is what

2493
02:27:04.74 --> 02:27:05.74
he's saying.

2494
02:27:05.74 --> 02:27:09.66
Back to the book, putting aside for the moment the question of the vices and regarding

2495
02:27:09.66 --> 02:27:15.10
only the gain to moral power, which comes of bodily exercise and physical condition.

2496
02:27:15.10 --> 02:27:18.58
So he's talked about vices, okay, we got it.

2497
02:27:18.58 --> 02:27:20.58
Stay clean.

2498
02:27:20.58 --> 02:27:21.94
Stay clean is what he's saying.

2499
02:27:21.94 --> 02:27:27.74
But now he's saying there's something else or something called exercise and physical conditioning.

2500
02:27:27.74 --> 02:27:31.94
It should be self-evident that the process which builds the muscle must also train and

2501
02:27:31.94 --> 02:27:33.54
alert the mind.

2502
02:27:33.54 --> 02:27:36.02
How could it be otherwise?

2503
02:27:36.02 --> 02:27:43.46
Every physical act must have as its origin, a mental impulse, conscious or unconscious.

2504
02:27:43.46 --> 02:27:50.66
Thus, in training a man to master his muscles, we also help him to master his brain.

2505
02:27:50.66 --> 02:27:56.02
He comes out of physical training not only better condition to move, but better prepared

2506
02:27:56.02 --> 02:28:02.90
to think about how and why he is moving, which is true mobility.

2507
02:28:02.90 --> 02:28:04.90
So you want to strengthen your will?

2508
02:28:04.90 --> 02:28:05.90
Yes.

2509
02:28:05.90 --> 02:28:06.90
Stay clean.

2510
02:28:06.90 --> 02:28:12.10
Stay on the moral path and then get your physical conditioning on because that's going

2511
02:28:12.10 --> 02:28:15.94
to make you mentally tougher.

2512
02:28:15.94 --> 02:28:19.50
Back to the book in the United States service, we are tending to forget because of the

2513
02:28:19.50 --> 02:28:26.14
effective motorization that the higher value of the discipline of the road march in other

2514
02:28:26.14 --> 02:28:30.10
days wasn't that it hardened the muscles.

2515
02:28:30.10 --> 02:28:37.58
But that short of combat, it was the best method of separating the men from the boys.

2516
02:28:37.58 --> 02:28:41.94
This is true today, despite all the new conditions imposed by technological changes.

2517
02:28:41.94 --> 02:28:47.34
A hard road march is the most satisfactory training test of the moral strength of the

2518
02:28:47.34 --> 02:28:50.18
individual man.

2519
02:28:50.18 --> 02:28:55.62
At the same time, to sensibly overload men, for road marching hurts them in two ways.

2520
02:28:55.62 --> 02:28:58.26
So there's a dichotomy to everything.

2521
02:28:58.26 --> 02:29:00.58
So you can hurt them with the road march.

2522
02:29:00.58 --> 02:29:01.58
Here's the two ways.

2523
02:29:01.58 --> 02:29:07.62
It weakens their faith in the sense of the command, thereby impairing morale, and it breaks

2524
02:29:07.62 --> 02:29:09.38
down their muscle and tendon.

2525
02:29:09.38 --> 02:29:11.58
So you overload them, you're going to crush them, you're going to break them, and you're

2526
02:29:11.58 --> 02:29:14.14
going to ruin their spirit.

2527
02:29:14.14 --> 02:29:18.30
There is another not infrequent cause of breakdown.

2528
02:29:18.30 --> 02:29:23.38
The leader who makes the mistake of thinking that every man's limit is the same as his

2529
02:29:23.38 --> 02:29:26.22
own.

2530
02:29:26.22 --> 02:29:29.50
So you, oh, I can do this.

2531
02:29:29.50 --> 02:29:32.06
I can dump in 20 miles or 20 clicks.

2532
02:29:32.06 --> 02:29:35.14
Everyone can do it, wrong answer.

2533
02:29:35.14 --> 02:29:39.90
When an officer does this kind of thing thoughtlessly, he shows himself to be an incompetent

2534
02:29:39.90 --> 02:29:41.90
observer of men.

2535
02:29:41.90 --> 02:29:47.14
He does it to show off he deserves to be given 10 days in the electric chair.

2536
02:29:47.14 --> 02:29:49.42
Hey, there you go.

2537
02:29:49.42 --> 02:29:51.14
Get me electric chair, 10 days.

2538
02:29:51.14 --> 02:29:54.18
That's like how many times do you die in 10 days in the electric chair?

2539
02:29:54.18 --> 02:29:55.34
No, a lot.

2540
02:29:55.34 --> 02:29:56.34
But don't show off.

2541
02:29:56.34 --> 02:29:57.34
It's the point.

2542
02:29:57.34 --> 02:29:58.34
Yeah.

2543
02:29:58.34 --> 02:30:00.46
Otherwise you're going in the electric chair for 10 days.

2544
02:30:00.46 --> 02:30:05.42
But isn't that like an old classic thing in the movie where it's usually to combat

2545
02:30:05.42 --> 02:30:07.66
like a situation where the guys are complaining.

2546
02:30:07.66 --> 02:30:09.74
You know, all of this is unrealistic.

2547
02:30:09.74 --> 02:30:12.02
I don't know, obstacle course.

2548
02:30:12.02 --> 02:30:13.02
Yeah.

2549
02:30:13.02 --> 02:30:15.86
And then the drill sergeant or whoever.

2550
02:30:15.86 --> 02:30:16.86
He does it.

2551
02:30:16.86 --> 02:30:18.30
You know, he's like the older guy.

2552
02:30:18.30 --> 02:30:19.70
Well, yeah, he's proving that look.

2553
02:30:19.70 --> 02:30:21.82
I'm not asking you do anything that I wouldn't do myself.

2554
02:30:21.82 --> 02:30:22.82
Yeah.

2555
02:30:22.82 --> 02:30:23.82
That's all that that is.

2556
02:30:23.82 --> 02:30:24.82
Right.

2557
02:30:24.82 --> 02:30:27.62
But in a way, he's like, hey, I can do it.

2558
02:30:27.62 --> 02:30:28.98
So you should be able to do it.

2559
02:30:28.98 --> 02:30:29.98
That's true.

2560
02:30:29.98 --> 02:30:30.98
Guess what?

2561
02:30:30.98 --> 02:30:33.34
A young recruit should be able to do it.

2562
02:30:33.34 --> 02:30:35.46
Oh, what's it?

2563
02:30:35.46 --> 02:30:36.78
Otherwise you're not reaching the standards.

2564
02:30:36.78 --> 02:30:38.18
We've got to have standards.

2565
02:30:38.18 --> 02:30:39.18
Yeah.

2566
02:30:39.18 --> 02:30:43.30
But if you were saying, hey, you should be able to do this with one on a time behind

2567
02:30:43.30 --> 02:30:44.30
your back like I can.

2568
02:30:44.30 --> 02:30:45.30
Could have been a big wrong.

2569
02:30:45.30 --> 02:30:46.30
Yeah.

2570
02:30:46.30 --> 02:30:47.30
You see the difference, sir?

2571
02:30:47.30 --> 02:30:48.30
Oh, yeah.

2572
02:30:48.30 --> 02:30:49.30
Because I make sure, because otherwise you can get me on the tech

2573
02:30:49.30 --> 02:30:50.30
Picallity.

2574
02:30:50.30 --> 02:30:52.50
Don't want that to happen over here.

2575
02:30:52.50 --> 02:30:57.74
Speaking of athletic accomplishments in the nature of things, the officer who's

2576
02:30:57.74 --> 02:31:02.74
been an athlete can fit himself into this part of the program with little difficulty and with

2577
02:31:02.74 --> 02:31:07.54
great credit provided he acts with moderation that it here is suggested.

2578
02:31:07.54 --> 02:31:11.50
By the same token, the officer who has shunned sports in school either because he didn't

2579
02:31:11.50 --> 02:31:15.34
have the size or coordination or it's more interested in something else will frequently

2580
02:31:15.34 --> 02:31:20.34
have an understandable hesitation about trying to play the lead hand in anything which

2581
02:31:20.34 --> 02:31:22.34
he thinks will make him look bad.

2582
02:31:22.34 --> 02:31:28.50
Just talking about the benefits of the sports.

2583
02:31:28.50 --> 02:31:34.22
If he has not kept himself in good physical shape, his nerves will not be able to stand

2584
02:31:34.22 --> 02:31:39.10
the strain of combat to say nothing of his legs.

2585
02:31:39.10 --> 02:31:43.42
It can be said again and again, the highest form of physical training that an officer

2586
02:31:43.42 --> 02:31:47.74
can undergo is the physical conditioning of his own men.

2587
02:31:47.74 --> 02:31:51.98
Nothing else can give him more faith in his own ability to stay the course and nothing

2588
02:31:51.98 --> 02:31:57.02
else is likely to give him a firm or feeling of solidarity with his men.

2589
02:31:57.02 --> 02:32:01.78
Study and an active thirst for wider professional knowledge have their place in an officer's

2590
02:32:01.78 --> 02:32:07.70
scheme of things but there is something about the experience of bodily competition of

2591
02:32:07.70 --> 02:32:13.58
joining with and leading men in strunuous physical exercise which uniquely invigorates

2592
02:32:13.58 --> 02:32:17.02
one spirit with the confidence I can do this.

2593
02:32:17.02 --> 02:32:18.18
I can lead.

2594
02:32:18.18 --> 02:32:22.94
I can command.

2595
02:32:22.94 --> 02:32:26.22
The body and minor connected everybody.

2596
02:32:26.22 --> 02:32:29.30
No it.

2597
02:32:29.30 --> 02:32:33.62
Back to the book, the really good thing about the gain and moral force deriving from

2598
02:32:33.62 --> 02:32:39.18
all forms of physical training is that it is an unconscious gain.

2599
02:32:39.18 --> 02:32:45.54
Willpower, determination, mental poise and muscle control all march hand in hand with

2600
02:32:45.54 --> 02:32:48.50
the general health and well-being of the man.

2601
02:32:48.50 --> 02:32:54.62
With results not less decisive under training conditions than on the field of battle.

2602
02:32:54.62 --> 02:32:58.86
A man who develops correct posture and begins to fill out his body so that he looks

2603
02:32:58.86 --> 02:33:03.38
the part of a fighter will take greater pride in wearing of the uniform.

2604
02:33:03.38 --> 02:33:09.50
In doing so, he will take greater care to conduct himself morally that he will not disgrace

2605
02:33:09.50 --> 02:33:10.50
it.

2606
02:33:10.50 --> 02:33:16.90
He will gain confidence as he acquires a confident and determined bearing.

2607
02:33:16.90 --> 02:33:21.70
The same presence and the physical strength which contributes to it will help carry him

2608
02:33:21.70 --> 02:33:24.98
through the hour of danger.

2609
02:33:24.98 --> 02:33:30.50
The strength of will is partly of the mind and partly of the body.

2610
02:33:30.50 --> 02:33:38.70
In combat fatigue will be down men as quickly as any other condition for fatigue inevitably

2611
02:33:38.70 --> 02:33:41.78
carries fear with it.

2612
02:33:41.78 --> 02:33:45.22
Tired men are afraid.

2613
02:33:45.22 --> 02:33:49.50
There is no quicker way to lose a battle than to lose it on the road for lack of preliminary

2614
02:33:49.50 --> 02:33:56.18
hardening intrups such a condition cannot be redeemed by the resolve of a commander who insists

2615
02:33:56.18 --> 02:34:01.82
on driving troops and extra mile beyond their general level of physical endurance.

2616
02:34:01.82 --> 02:34:05.34
So if you got guys that aren't ready, just because you're fired up doesn't mean it's

2617
02:34:05.34 --> 02:34:06.34
going to work.

2618
02:34:06.34 --> 02:34:07.62
You can't push them hard now.

2619
02:34:07.62 --> 02:34:08.62
Here's what happens.

2620
02:34:08.62 --> 02:34:13.66
Extremes of this sort make men rebellious and hateful of the command and thus strike

2621
02:34:13.66 --> 02:34:20.66
a tactical efficiency from two directions at once for when men resent a commander they will

2622
02:34:20.66 --> 02:34:30.70
not fight as willingly for him and when their bodies are spent, their nerves are gone.

2623
02:34:30.70 --> 02:34:33.42
Physical conditioning.

2624
02:34:33.42 --> 02:34:35.98
Now on top of that we got the physical conditioning.

2625
02:34:35.98 --> 02:34:43.38
You also have to keep your people informed in war in the absence of information,

2626
02:34:43.38 --> 02:34:50.06
natural promptings alternate between unresening fears that the worst is likely to happen

2627
02:34:50.06 --> 02:34:54.78
and a wispful thought that all danger is remote.

2628
02:34:54.78 --> 02:34:59.94
Either impulse is a barrier to the growth of that condition of alert confidence which

2629
02:34:59.94 --> 02:35:05.26
comes to men when they have a realization of their own strength and a reasonably clear

2630
02:35:05.26 --> 02:35:10.66
concept of the general situation.

2631
02:35:10.66 --> 02:35:13.50
You've got to keep your people informed as well as talking about earlier being at the

2632
02:35:13.50 --> 02:35:18.10
end of a poll tune.

2633
02:35:18.10 --> 02:35:21.78
Next section is about counseling your men.

2634
02:35:21.78 --> 02:35:26.62
Nothing more unfortunate can happen to an officer than to come to be regarded by his

2635
02:35:26.62 --> 02:35:29.50
support and says unapproachable.

2636
02:35:29.50 --> 02:35:35.66
For such a reputation itulates him from the main problems of the command, responsibility

2637
02:35:35.66 --> 02:35:37.98
as well as its chief rewards.

2638
02:35:37.98 --> 02:35:41.34
Now, how do you become approachable?

2639
02:35:41.34 --> 02:35:47.10
The two formal manner, the overrigid attitude, the disposition to deal with any human

2640
02:35:47.10 --> 02:35:52.74
problem by the numbers as if it were one more act in an organizational routine can have

2641
02:35:52.74 --> 02:35:56.22
a chilling effect upon men.

2642
02:35:56.22 --> 02:36:00.18
So that idea that you're just going to be by the book on everything that's not going

2643
02:36:00.18 --> 02:36:03.34
to make you approachable.

2644
02:36:03.34 --> 02:36:07.94
That being said, back to the book, it is not necessary that an officer wet nurse is

2645
02:36:07.94 --> 02:36:11.90
men in order to serve well in the role of counsel.

2646
02:36:11.90 --> 02:36:16.98
His door should be open, but he's not play the part either of father, confessor, or

2647
02:36:16.98 --> 02:36:19.78
of a hotel greeter.

2648
02:36:19.78 --> 02:36:24.54
Neither great solony or a fusedness are called for, but mainly serious attention to the

2649
02:36:24.54 --> 02:36:28.14
problem and then straightforward advice or decision.

2650
02:36:28.14 --> 02:36:32.66
According to the nature of the case and provided that from his own knowledge and experience,

2651
02:36:32.66 --> 02:36:36.10
he feels qualified to give it.

2652
02:36:36.10 --> 02:36:41.38
If not, it is wiser to defer than to offer a half-baked opinion.

2653
02:36:41.38 --> 02:36:43.42
So that's okay if you don't know.

2654
02:36:43.42 --> 02:36:44.42
Hey look, I don't know.

2655
02:36:44.42 --> 02:36:46.06
I'm done with this before.

2656
02:36:46.06 --> 02:36:50.26
Maybe you should go talk to Echo, he deals with these computers all the time, come

2657
02:36:50.26 --> 02:36:55.54
to me with your computer problems.

2658
02:36:55.54 --> 02:36:59.94
Back to the book, World War II officers had to abide by this standard dealing with

2659
02:36:59.94 --> 02:37:05.06
the general malaise which rose out of redeployment.

2660
02:37:05.06 --> 02:37:09.26
When a man came forward and said that he couldn't take it anymore and the commander knew

2661
02:37:09.26 --> 02:37:14.46
that he'd always been a highly, doodiful individual, it became the commander's job to attempt

2662
02:37:14.46 --> 02:37:16.34
to get the man home.

2663
02:37:16.34 --> 02:37:21.66
But when a second man came forward with the same story and the record showed that he'd always

2664
02:37:21.66 --> 02:37:26.70
shirked his work, the question was whether he should be given the final chance to shirk

2665
02:37:26.70 --> 02:37:28.66
it again.

2666
02:37:28.66 --> 02:37:32.58
The favor of the first man meant furthering discipline.

2667
02:37:32.58 --> 02:37:36.34
His comrades recognized it as a fair deal.

2668
02:37:36.34 --> 02:37:41.78
To turn back the second man was equally constructive to the same end.

2669
02:37:41.78 --> 02:37:43.22
So those are just classic.

2670
02:37:43.22 --> 02:37:45.42
We've seen that in just about every book we read.

2671
02:37:45.42 --> 02:37:48.38
With some guy World War II, we saw a bunch of it.

2672
02:37:48.38 --> 02:37:51.50
Some guy would just lose it and we even saw the Korean, some of the Korean books we've

2673
02:37:51.50 --> 02:37:52.50
covered.

2674
02:37:52.50 --> 02:37:53.50
The guy loses it.

2675
02:37:53.50 --> 02:37:54.50
But they're a good guy.

2676
02:37:54.50 --> 02:37:55.50
Remember the guy walked around and asleep in the back.

2677
02:37:55.50 --> 02:37:57.70
Look, we're just going to take care of this guy.

2678
02:37:57.70 --> 02:37:58.70
He's been a good guy.

2679
02:37:58.70 --> 02:37:59.70
We'll get him off the front.

2680
02:37:59.70 --> 02:38:01.02
He's got a few days left.

2681
02:38:01.02 --> 02:38:06.42
But then when you get a guy that's weak and scared and doesn't man up and do his duty, and

2682
02:38:06.42 --> 02:38:08.98
he wants to go home, they're not giving that guy the slack.

2683
02:38:08.98 --> 02:38:14.86
Doesn't deserve it, didn't earn it.

2684
02:38:14.86 --> 02:38:16.06
Now this is interesting.

2685
02:38:16.06 --> 02:38:22.58
There are officers who hold every subordinate like Grim Death, seeing no better way to advance

2686
02:38:22.58 --> 02:38:24.06
their personal fortunes.

2687
02:38:24.06 --> 02:38:27.02
So this is what we're talking about here is, and this happens a lot in the military.

2688
02:38:27.02 --> 02:38:31.58
It happens in every business I work with where you got people that are being moved around.

2689
02:38:31.58 --> 02:38:33.06
So like, oh, echo works.

2690
02:38:33.06 --> 02:38:34.70
You got this guy Billy that works for you.

2691
02:38:34.70 --> 02:38:36.82
Hey, I need Billy to help me with this project.

2692
02:38:36.82 --> 02:38:37.82
What do you say?

2693
02:38:37.82 --> 02:38:39.06
No, you can't have him.

2694
02:38:39.06 --> 02:38:40.06
He's my guy.

2695
02:38:40.06 --> 02:38:41.06
What are you working on right now?

2696
02:38:41.06 --> 02:38:42.06
I got some projects coming up.

2697
02:38:42.06 --> 02:38:43.06
I need him right now.

2698
02:38:43.06 --> 02:38:44.06
Don't say I have a project.

2699
02:38:44.06 --> 02:38:45.06
You know what I'm saying?

2700
02:38:45.06 --> 02:38:49.10
Some people go into that mode where they hold everyone like a Grim Death.

2701
02:38:49.10 --> 02:38:53.86
They're officers who hold every able subordinate like Grim Death, seeing no better way to

2702
02:38:53.86 --> 02:38:56.22
advance their personal fortunes.

2703
02:38:56.22 --> 02:39:03.18
This is a sign of moral weakness, not of strength, and it is inevitable fruit.

2704
02:39:03.18 --> 02:39:07.58
And it's inevitable fruit is discontent within the organization.

2705
02:39:07.58 --> 02:39:13.14
The sign of superiority in any officer at whatever level is his confidence that he can make

2706
02:39:13.14 --> 02:39:18.94
another good man to fill any vacancy.

2707
02:39:18.94 --> 02:39:21.54
The other time I don't like that is when somebody, you know, if you're going to give

2708
02:39:21.54 --> 02:39:25.42
me Billy and it's actually a promotion for Billy, it's like a step up, but you don't

2709
02:39:25.42 --> 02:39:26.42
want to give me any of these.

2710
02:39:26.42 --> 02:39:29.86
You're hurting him because you're trying to help yourself.

2711
02:39:29.86 --> 02:39:30.86
No, give the guy up.

2712
02:39:30.86 --> 02:39:31.86
Find somebody else new.

2713
02:39:31.86 --> 02:39:32.86
Find a better person.

2714
02:39:32.86 --> 02:39:34.58
Find somebody who's going to mold and make better.

2715
02:39:34.58 --> 02:39:36.86
Yeah, that happened to me before.

2716
02:39:36.86 --> 02:39:38.86
Were you the guy?

2717
02:39:38.86 --> 02:39:40.26
Were you the guy?

2718
02:39:40.26 --> 02:39:42.26
The guy that got didn't get promoted?

2719
02:39:42.26 --> 02:39:43.26
Correct.

2720
02:39:43.26 --> 02:39:44.86
Somebody held onto you.

2721
02:39:44.86 --> 02:39:51.42
Yeah, and it was less about if I did or didn't get promoted, it was that he was just

2722
02:39:51.42 --> 02:39:52.42
holding on.

2723
02:39:52.42 --> 02:39:55.62
Where, you know, took kind of negating any chance of that.

2724
02:39:55.62 --> 02:39:56.62
It was clear.

2725
02:39:56.62 --> 02:39:58.34
He actually even told me to.

2726
02:39:58.34 --> 02:40:01.34
Well, that was at least straightforward of him.

2727
02:40:01.34 --> 02:40:02.34
Yeah.

2728
02:40:02.34 --> 02:40:03.34
Not good.

2729
02:40:03.34 --> 02:40:07.70
How that work out for you for your morale?

2730
02:40:07.70 --> 02:40:08.70
It didn't help.

2731
02:40:08.70 --> 02:40:12.18
What are the other way?

2732
02:40:12.18 --> 02:40:13.18
Back to the book.

2733
02:40:13.18 --> 02:40:17.66
Some of the ableist commanders in our service have abided by this rule.

2734
02:40:17.66 --> 02:40:21.66
They never denied the man who had a legitimate reason for transfer.

2735
02:40:21.66 --> 02:40:28.90
And they never shuffled off their lemons and gold bricks under a false label.

2736
02:40:28.90 --> 02:40:31.30
So that does another thing that happened in businesses.

2737
02:40:31.30 --> 02:40:33.50
Hey, you got Billy, he'd Billy's a bum.

2738
02:40:33.50 --> 02:40:36.26
And I say, hey, echo, I need a guy over here to help me with this.

2739
02:40:36.26 --> 02:40:37.50
Oh, yeah, you can have Billy.

2740
02:40:37.50 --> 02:40:38.50
Great guy.

2741
02:40:38.50 --> 02:40:39.50
Yeah.

2742
02:40:39.50 --> 02:40:40.50
You can be Billy, he's a disaster.

2743
02:40:40.50 --> 02:40:41.90
That's a gold brick.

2744
02:40:41.90 --> 02:40:45.90
It's a lie.

2745
02:40:45.90 --> 02:40:51.14
Here's a few common sense rules which when followed will enable any officer to play

2746
02:40:51.14 --> 02:40:54.26
his part more effectively in the counseling of men.

2747
02:40:54.26 --> 02:40:58.10
And excess of expression is a failing.

2748
02:40:58.10 --> 02:41:03.62
So when you give away your facial expression, looks all that's a failing.

2749
02:41:03.62 --> 02:41:08.86
To listen well is the prelude toward pondering carefully and speaking wisely.

2750
02:41:08.86 --> 02:41:12.26
Listen, got to listen.

2751
02:41:12.26 --> 02:41:18.90
To refuse with kindness is more winning than to acquiesce ungratiously.

2752
02:41:18.90 --> 02:41:21.50
That's a good one.

2753
02:41:21.50 --> 02:41:24.62
Just anyone I don't think it's going to be rather than all right.

2754
02:41:24.62 --> 02:41:25.62
Yeah.

2755
02:41:25.62 --> 02:41:27.86
That's something you've got to deal with with your wife.

2756
02:41:27.86 --> 02:41:29.26
Your wife wants to go do something.

2757
02:41:29.26 --> 02:41:31.82
If you'd be better to say, you know what I'm thinking?

2758
02:41:31.82 --> 02:41:32.90
All right, let's not do that tonight.

2759
02:41:32.90 --> 02:41:35.06
Let's do this other thing instead.

2760
02:41:35.06 --> 02:41:36.38
As opposed to all right, fine.

2761
02:41:36.38 --> 02:41:39.94
We'll go to your friend's house.

2762
02:41:39.94 --> 02:41:41.38
Don't want to do that.

2763
02:41:41.38 --> 02:41:43.42
Yeah, I feel like a dick when you get there.

2764
02:41:43.42 --> 02:41:44.66
Yeah.

2765
02:41:44.66 --> 02:41:50.74
To note another man's mood and become congenial to it is the surest way to engage

2766
02:41:50.74 --> 02:41:53.30
his confidence.

2767
02:41:53.30 --> 02:41:59.98
Decisions which are holy of the heart and not of the mind will ultimately do hurt

2768
02:41:59.98 --> 02:42:02.98
to both places.

2769
02:42:02.98 --> 02:42:03.98
Use your logic.

2770
02:42:03.98 --> 02:42:06.14
Don't get emotional.

2771
02:42:06.14 --> 02:42:09.98
No man will talk freely if met by silence.

2772
02:42:09.98 --> 02:42:17.18
But an intelligent question encourages frankness above all else.

2773
02:42:17.18 --> 02:42:22.78
When a man loses possession of himself, it is the more reason that the other should

2774
02:42:22.78 --> 02:42:28.30
tighten his reserve legit.

2775
02:42:28.30 --> 02:42:29.38
This is a good one.

2776
02:42:29.38 --> 02:42:38.54
To express pity for a man does not serve to restore him and put him above pity.

2777
02:42:38.54 --> 02:42:43.82
And a man is so burdened by a personal problem that it shuts out all else.

2778
02:42:43.82 --> 02:42:47.78
He must be led to something else.

2779
02:42:47.78 --> 02:42:53.82
And the last one here, impudent tactics can undo the wise strategy.

2780
02:42:53.82 --> 02:42:57.18
And that happens at every level that happens in a ward, happens in business.

2781
02:42:57.18 --> 02:43:03.14
Got a great strategy, but the guys on the ground are really not doing it tactically well.

2782
02:43:03.14 --> 02:43:07.50
Doesn't matter the strategy you're going to fail.

2783
02:43:07.50 --> 02:43:14.30
The encountering like all else in military life has a combat purpose.

2784
02:43:14.30 --> 02:43:19.38
Other things being equal, the tactical unity of men working together in combat will

2785
02:43:19.38 --> 02:43:25.58
be in ratio to their knowledge and sympathetic understanding of each other.

2786
02:43:25.58 --> 02:43:31.34
Whatever the cause, aloofness, on the part of the officer can only produce a further

2787
02:43:31.34 --> 02:43:42.62
withdrawal on that part of the man, aloofness.

2788
02:43:42.62 --> 02:43:50.94
Now the last section of this book was really devastating on my highlighter.

2789
02:43:50.94 --> 02:43:56.14
It's called Americans in combat.

2790
02:43:56.14 --> 02:44:00.66
The command and control of men in combat can be mastered by junior leaders of American forces

2791
02:44:00.66 --> 02:44:04.90
short of actual experience under enemy fire.

2792
02:44:04.90 --> 02:44:09.70
It is altogether possible for a young officer as first time in battle to be in total possession

2793
02:44:09.70 --> 02:44:15.90
of his faculties and moving by instinct to do the right thing provided that he has made

2794
02:44:15.90 --> 02:44:20.62
the most of his training opportunities.

2795
02:44:20.62 --> 02:44:26.26
Exercise in the maneuvering of men is only an elementary introduction to this educational

2796
02:44:26.26 --> 02:44:27.50
process.

2797
02:44:27.50 --> 02:44:33.54
The basic requirement is continuing study first of the nature of men, second of the techniques

2798
02:44:33.54 --> 02:44:40.70
which produce unified action and last of the history of past operations which are covered

2799
02:44:40.70 --> 02:44:42.94
by an abundant literature.

2800
02:44:42.94 --> 02:44:45.74
That's how you got to get ready for combat.

2801
02:44:45.74 --> 02:44:47.54
Those things right there.

2802
02:44:47.54 --> 02:44:52.10
Now there are a few simple and fundamental propositions which the armed services subscribe

2803
02:44:52.10 --> 02:44:58.66
in saying to officer corps what may be expected of the average man of the United States under

2804
02:44:58.66 --> 02:45:01.10
battle conditions.

2805
02:45:01.10 --> 02:45:07.22
Generally speaking they have held true of Americans in times past from Lexington to Okinawa.

2806
02:45:07.22 --> 02:45:13.04
The fighting establishment builds its discipline, training, code of conduct and public

2807
02:45:13.04 --> 02:45:19.30
policy around these ideas believing that what served yesterday will also be the one best

2808
02:45:19.30 --> 02:45:21.30
way tomorrow.

2809
02:45:21.30 --> 02:45:26.50
And for so long as our traditions and our system of freedom survives, these propositions

2810
02:45:26.50 --> 02:45:34.66
are when led with courage and intelligence and American will fight as willingly as and

2811
02:45:34.66 --> 02:45:39.30
as efficiently as any fighter in world history.

2812
02:45:39.30 --> 02:45:41.86
I can occur with that.

2813
02:45:41.86 --> 02:45:46.66
His keenness and endurance and war will be in proportion to the zeal and inspiration

2814
02:45:46.66 --> 02:45:49.46
of his leadership.

2815
02:45:49.46 --> 02:45:56.82
He is resourceful and imaginative and the best results will always flow from encouraging

2816
02:45:56.82 --> 02:46:02.54
him to use his brain along with his spirit.

2817
02:46:02.54 --> 02:46:08.42
Under combat conditions he will reserve his greatest loyalty for the officer who is most

2818
02:46:08.42 --> 02:46:15.46
resourceful in the tactical employment of his forces and most careful to avoid unnecessary

2819
02:46:15.46 --> 02:46:18.22
losses.

2820
02:46:18.22 --> 02:46:22.34
So the soldiers going to know if you're throwing bodies away they're going to know it.

2821
02:46:22.34 --> 02:46:23.74
The same thing in the business world.

2822
02:46:23.74 --> 02:46:28.94
I've worked with a lot of companies where they do their utmost to let's say there's a

2823
02:46:28.94 --> 02:46:34.10
downturn in the market and they're going to fire some people and they do their best

2824
02:46:34.10 --> 02:46:35.74
to mitigate that.

2825
02:46:35.74 --> 02:46:37.26
That develops loyalty.

2826
02:46:37.26 --> 02:46:40.46
That makes them fight harder when the market turns back around.

2827
02:46:40.46 --> 02:46:44.26
Now sometimes that can be a problem because people try and be so loyal that they'd run

2828
02:46:44.26 --> 02:46:45.46
their business in the ground.

2829
02:46:45.46 --> 02:46:50.18
And they fail.

2830
02:46:50.18 --> 02:46:55.70
Back to the book except on a Hollywood lot there is no such thing as an American fighter

2831
02:46:55.70 --> 02:46:57.46
type.

2832
02:46:57.46 --> 02:47:03.14
Our best-month men come in all colors, shapes and sizes.

2833
02:47:03.14 --> 02:47:10.18
They appear from every section of the nation including the territories.

2834
02:47:10.18 --> 02:47:16.54
In battle, Americans do not tend to fluctuate between emotional extremes in complete

2835
02:47:16.54 --> 02:47:22.42
rejection one day and exaltation the next according to the changes in the situation.

2836
02:47:22.42 --> 02:47:27.58
They continue on the whole on a fairly even kill when a going is tough and when things

2837
02:47:27.58 --> 02:47:30.50
are breaking their way.

2838
02:47:30.50 --> 02:47:36.62
Even when heavily shocked by battle losses they tend to bound back quickly.

2839
02:47:36.62 --> 02:47:43.50
Though their griping is incestant, their natural outlook is on the optimistic side and

2840
02:47:43.50 --> 02:47:52.06
they react unfavorably to the officer who looks eternally on the dark side.

2841
02:47:52.06 --> 02:47:58.66
Next, during battle American officers are not expected either to drive their men or to be

2842
02:47:58.66 --> 02:48:02.06
forever in the van as if praying to be shot.

2843
02:48:02.06 --> 02:48:07.18
So the van is like on the front lines, the front of your formation.

2844
02:48:07.18 --> 02:48:13.30
So long as they are with their men taking the same chances as their men and showing a firm

2845
02:48:13.30 --> 02:48:19.34
grasp of the situation and of the line of action which should be followed, the men will

2846
02:48:19.34 --> 02:48:22.30
go forward.

2847
02:48:22.30 --> 02:48:28.78
In any situation of extreme pressure or more exhaustion where men cannot otherwise be rallied

2848
02:48:28.78 --> 02:48:36.22
and led forward, officers are expected to do the actual physical act of leading such as

2849
02:48:36.22 --> 02:48:42.46
performing as first scout or point, even though this means taking over what would normally

2850
02:48:42.46 --> 02:48:45.70
be an enlisted man's function.

2851
02:48:45.70 --> 02:48:52.30
The normal next, the normal, grigarius American is not at his best when playing alone

2852
02:48:52.30 --> 02:48:56.26
handed or tactically isolated part in battle.

2853
02:48:56.26 --> 02:49:00.18
He is not a comacosio or a one-man torpedo.

2854
02:49:00.18 --> 02:49:05.58
Consequently, the best tactical results obtained from those dispositions and methods which

2855
02:49:05.58 --> 02:49:10.98
link the power of one man to that of another.

2856
02:49:10.98 --> 02:49:16.02
Men who feel strange with their unit, having been carelessly received by it and indifantly

2857
02:49:16.02 --> 02:49:22.06
handled will rarely, if ever, fight strongly and courageously.

2858
02:49:22.06 --> 02:49:28.54
And if treated with common decency and respect, they will perform like men.

2859
02:49:28.54 --> 02:49:31.34
So that's just talking when you check in somewhere.

2860
02:49:31.34 --> 02:49:34.34
If you're in a military and you get somebody that checks in, take care of them.

2861
02:49:34.34 --> 02:49:35.34
Welcome.

2862
02:49:35.34 --> 02:49:37.06
If you're to company in somebody checks in, take care of them.

2863
02:49:37.06 --> 02:49:43.70
Welcome, show them around to sign a mentor, get them in the game.

2864
02:49:43.70 --> 02:49:51.86
To lie to American troops to cover up a blundering combat rarely serves any valid purpose.

2865
02:49:51.86 --> 02:49:57.78
They have a good sense of combat and an uncanny instinct for ferooding out the truth when

2866
02:49:57.78 --> 02:50:01.10
anything goes wrong tactically.

2867
02:50:01.10 --> 02:50:09.30
They will excuse mistakes, but they will not forgive being treated like children.

2868
02:50:09.30 --> 02:50:14.90
Basic leadership.

2869
02:50:14.90 --> 02:50:16.10
Good one here.

2870
02:50:16.10 --> 02:50:21.90
And spit and polish are laid on so heavily that they become onerous.

2871
02:50:21.90 --> 02:50:27.22
And the ranks cannot see any legitimate connection between the requirements and the development

2872
02:50:27.22 --> 02:50:30.98
of an attitude which will serve a clear fighting purpose.

2873
02:50:30.98 --> 02:50:36.86
It is to be questioned that the exaction serves any good object, whatever.

2874
02:50:36.86 --> 02:50:39.54
So again, I'm like leaning in the sealed teams.

2875
02:50:39.54 --> 02:50:47.50
I'm probably the extreme level of military bearing and uniformity, but I'm definitely not

2876
02:50:47.50 --> 02:50:49.86
a believer that you got everything.

2877
02:50:49.86 --> 02:50:53.46
Every single thing spit and polish all day long.

2878
02:50:53.46 --> 02:50:57.22
And they're saying clearly here that if you go so far in that direction and people don't

2879
02:50:57.22 --> 02:50:59.50
make any sense of it, it's not going to be good.

2880
02:50:59.50 --> 02:51:03.98
I mean, even picture, you know, hack worth was like Mr. Spit and polish.

2881
02:51:03.98 --> 02:51:05.66
Look at pictures of hack worth and Vietnam.

2882
02:51:05.66 --> 02:51:10.66
You wouldn't even wear a rank.

2883
02:51:10.66 --> 02:51:13.90
He makes one of the guys from that come into the camp that look like they're in parade

2884
02:51:13.90 --> 02:51:16.18
ground uniforms.

2885
02:51:16.18 --> 02:51:26.70
I saw a quote, like yesterday, said a spotless house is the sign of a wasted life, which

2886
02:51:26.70 --> 02:51:33.86
when I saw it, I tend to disagree with a lot because it basically takes one kind of perspective

2887
02:51:33.86 --> 02:51:37.70
and makes it into this thing.

2888
02:51:37.70 --> 02:51:44.46
But with this one, I was like, well, or it means you clean your house all the time.

2889
02:51:44.46 --> 02:51:46.46
That's where you know, maybe you're disciplined.

2890
02:51:46.46 --> 02:51:49.46
You clean your stuff, including your house.

2891
02:51:49.46 --> 02:51:50.46
I don't know.

2892
02:51:50.46 --> 02:51:51.46
Maybe take care of your house.

2893
02:51:51.46 --> 02:51:52.98
Maybe you're a clean person.

2894
02:51:52.98 --> 02:51:54.86
That's not a waste of life by the way.

2895
02:51:54.86 --> 02:52:00.42
Yeah, I think that's an extreme statement, but I think the underlying message is, hey,

2896
02:52:00.42 --> 02:52:01.42
live a little.

2897
02:52:01.42 --> 02:52:03.82
It's basically, yeah, in a way, it's kind of the

2898
02:52:03.82 --> 02:52:05.90
message there is kind of what you're saying.

2899
02:52:05.90 --> 02:52:09.74
If you take it literally, yeah, that could you could go too far down that road.

2900
02:52:09.74 --> 02:52:13.26
But just take it as a message.

2901
02:52:13.26 --> 02:52:15.10
I think the message is fairly clear.

2902
02:52:15.10 --> 02:52:16.78
And I, I get some more to agree with that.

2903
02:52:16.78 --> 02:52:20.38
Yeah, like you spent your whole life making sure everything in your house is clean.

2904
02:52:20.38 --> 02:52:26.70
Yeah, you know, they say also, like the highly polished samurai sword that's never been

2905
02:52:26.70 --> 02:52:33.70
used in battle is a lot less valuable to me than the switchblade knife that's rusty from

2906
02:52:33.70 --> 02:52:34.70
blood.

2907
02:52:34.70 --> 02:52:35.70
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2908
02:52:35.70 --> 02:52:37.70
K-bar that's rusty from blood.

2909
02:52:37.70 --> 02:52:38.70
Yeah.

2910
02:52:38.70 --> 02:52:39.70
Yeah.

2911
02:52:39.70 --> 02:52:42.82
Next one.

2912
02:52:42.82 --> 02:52:48.10
On the other hand, because standards of discipline and courtesy are designed for the

2913
02:52:48.10 --> 02:52:53.22
express purpose of furthering control under the extraordinary frictions and presions of

2914
02:52:53.22 --> 02:53:01.10
the battlefield, their maintenance under combat conditions is as necessary as during training.

2915
02:53:01.10 --> 02:53:07.42
This and respect are the marks of military alertness, no matter how trying the circumstances.

2916
02:53:07.42 --> 02:53:12.70
But courtesy starts at the top in the dealing of any officer with his subordinates and in

2917
02:53:12.70 --> 02:53:17.34
the decent regard for their loyalty, intelligence and manhood.

2918
02:53:17.34 --> 02:53:23.30
So even though you can't be over-discipline, you've to go to have the discipline.

2919
02:53:23.30 --> 02:53:29.30
Next though Americans enjoy relatively about to fall.

2920
02:53:29.30 --> 02:53:35.62
Even luxurious standard of living in their home environment, they do not have to be pampered,

2921
02:53:35.62 --> 02:53:42.62
spoon fed, or overfilled with every comfort and convenience to keep them steadfast and

2922
02:53:42.62 --> 02:53:45.22
devoted once war comes.

2923
02:53:45.22 --> 02:53:49.94
They are by nature rugged men and in the field they will respond most perfectly when

2924
02:53:49.94 --> 02:53:53.90
called on to play a rugged part.

2925
02:53:53.90 --> 02:53:59.26
Soft handling will soften even the best men.

2926
02:53:59.26 --> 02:54:04.42
But even the weak man will develop a new vigor and confidence in the face of necessary

2927
02:54:04.42 --> 02:54:12.02
hardship if moved by a leadership which is courageously making the best of a bad situation.

2928
02:54:12.02 --> 02:54:14.62
It's just awesome.

2929
02:54:14.62 --> 02:54:22.42
Soft handling will soften even the best men and the weak man will come around for a necessary

2930
02:54:22.42 --> 02:54:23.42
hardship.

2931
02:54:23.42 --> 02:54:26.22
You notice they put that word in their nest and not just being them up for no reason.

2932
02:54:26.22 --> 02:54:30.70
They gotta see why it is.

2933
02:54:30.70 --> 02:54:35.58
Next, extravagance and wastefulness is somewhat rooted in the American character because

2934
02:54:35.58 --> 02:54:37.46
of our mode of life.

2935
02:54:37.46 --> 02:54:42.26
When our men enter the military service, there's a strong holdover from their civilian

2936
02:54:42.26 --> 02:54:43.26
habits.

2937
02:54:43.26 --> 02:54:47.06
Even under fighting conditions, they tend to be wasteful of drinking water, food, munition,

2938
02:54:47.06 --> 02:54:51.86
and other vital supply when such things are made to accessible.

2939
02:54:51.86 --> 02:54:56.78
They tend to throw them away rather than conserve them in the general interests.

2940
02:54:56.78 --> 02:54:59.82
This is a distinct weakness during combat.

2941
02:54:59.82 --> 02:55:05.82
When conservation of all supplies, the touchstone of success, the regulating of all supply

2942
02:55:05.82 --> 02:55:15.62
and the preventing of waste in any form is the prime obligation of every officer.

2943
02:55:15.62 --> 02:55:19.62
Be frugal.

2944
02:55:19.62 --> 02:55:22.50
Next, under the conditions of battle.

2945
02:55:22.50 --> 02:55:27.70
Any extra work, exercise, maneuver, or marching, which does not serve a clear and direct

2946
02:55:27.70 --> 02:55:31.30
operational purpose is unjustifiable.

2947
02:55:31.30 --> 02:55:36.78
The supreme object is to keep men as physically fresh and mentally alert as possible.

2948
02:55:36.78 --> 02:55:41.38
Tired men take fright and are half whipped before the battle opens.

2949
02:55:41.38 --> 02:55:44.70
War now officers cannot make clear decisions.

2950
02:55:44.70 --> 02:55:50.18
The conservation of men's powers, not the exhaustion thereof, is the successful way of

2951
02:55:50.18 --> 02:55:56.18
operations.

2952
02:55:56.18 --> 02:56:02.70
Next, when forces are committed to combat, it is vital that not one unnecessary pound

2953
02:56:02.70 --> 02:56:06.14
be put on any man's back.

2954
02:56:06.14 --> 02:56:11.14
Lightness of foot is the key to speed of movement and the increase of fire power.

2955
02:56:11.14 --> 02:56:16.10
And judging of these things, every officer's thoughts should be on the optimistic side.

2956
02:56:16.10 --> 02:56:19.88
It is better to take the chance that men will manage to get by on a little less than to

2957
02:56:19.88 --> 02:56:27.34
overload them through over cautious reckoning of every possible contingency thereby destroying

2958
02:56:27.34 --> 02:56:31.70
their power to do anything effectively.

2959
02:56:31.70 --> 02:56:33.10
Every pound counts.

2960
02:56:33.10 --> 02:56:40.10
They used to when I was at a team two, they had winter warfare plethora and so you'd be up burning

2961
02:56:40.10 --> 02:56:47.18
calories on skis and those guys were so anal about making their gear as light as possible

2962
02:56:47.18 --> 02:56:48.18
was pretty impressive.

2963
02:56:48.18 --> 02:56:51.42
So, you know when you got a backpack or something and it's got straps, you know, that

2964
02:56:51.42 --> 02:56:53.70
you can loosen up or tighten up.

2965
02:56:53.70 --> 02:56:59.70
They would through the whole backpack, they would cut off any excess strap would be gone.

2966
02:56:59.70 --> 02:57:07.14
Just get everything as light as possible.

2967
02:57:07.14 --> 02:57:10.30
It's kind of a good strategy to follow when you travel.

2968
02:57:10.30 --> 02:57:14.30
You know, you know, you know, how like you know what the funny thing is, too, is I've

2969
02:57:14.30 --> 02:57:15.30
got this now.

2970
02:57:15.30 --> 02:57:16.30
I've got this pretty down.

2971
02:57:16.30 --> 02:57:19.82
What I'm like, you know what if I don't have this, if I don't bring this and I need

2972
02:57:19.82 --> 02:57:21.14
it, I'm just going to buy it.

2973
02:57:21.14 --> 02:57:22.82
But go to a wherever and buy it.

2974
02:57:22.82 --> 02:57:23.82
No factor.

2975
02:57:23.82 --> 02:57:30.82
No.

2976
02:57:30.82 --> 02:57:33.82
Yeah.

2977
02:57:33.82 --> 02:57:30.82
And because there's kind of those two like schools that thought, I don't know, whatever, two ways to think about it.

2978
02:57:30.82 --> 02:57:32.10
Where the person is like, I might need it.

2979
02:57:32.10 --> 02:57:33.10
So I'm going to bring it.

2980
02:57:33.10 --> 02:57:38.38
Another person is like, if I can't think of a specific time that I'm going to need this on the

2981
02:57:38.38 --> 02:57:39.90
strip, I'm not going to bring it.

2982
02:57:39.90 --> 02:57:43.90
And just like how you say it, if I need it, I'll buy it there.

2983
02:57:43.90 --> 02:57:45.90
Travel light for you tonight.

2984
02:57:45.90 --> 02:57:47.90
Yeah, that's all right.

2985
02:57:47.90 --> 02:57:48.90
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2986
02:57:48.90 --> 02:57:50.90
It's all over the level.

2987
02:57:50.90 --> 02:57:56.54
Just unity of action develops from fullness of information.

2988
02:57:56.54 --> 02:58:02.34
In combat, all ranks have to know what is being done and why it is being done.

2989
02:58:02.34 --> 02:58:07.18
If confusion is to be kept to a minimum, this holds true in all types of operations

2990
02:58:07.18 --> 02:58:11.14
or whatever the service.

2991
02:58:11.14 --> 02:58:16.54
However, a surplus of information clouds the mind and may sometimes depress the spirit.

2992
02:58:16.54 --> 02:58:17.54
We can take one example.

2993
02:58:17.54 --> 02:58:22.66
Commander might be confronted by a complex situation and a solution may be a continuing

2994
02:58:22.66 --> 02:58:25.62
operation in three distinct phases.

2995
02:58:25.62 --> 02:58:29.98
It would be advisable that all hands be told the complete detail of phase A, but it might

2996
02:58:29.98 --> 02:58:35.06
be equally sensible that his subordinates only his subordinates who are closest to him be made

2997
02:58:35.06 --> 02:58:38.66
fully informed about phase B and phase C.

2998
02:58:38.66 --> 02:58:43.34
All plans and combat are subject to modification as to circumstances dictate.

2999
02:58:43.34 --> 02:58:44.58
This being the case.

3000
02:58:44.58 --> 02:58:46.66
It is not better.

3001
02:58:46.66 --> 02:58:53.90
It is better not to model the men by filling their minds with a seemingly conflict of ideas.

3002
02:58:53.90 --> 02:58:55.62
A conflict in ideas.

3003
02:58:55.62 --> 02:59:00.18
More important still, if the grand object seems too vast and formidable, even the

3004
02:59:00.18 --> 02:59:04.26
first step toward it may appear doubly difficult.

3005
02:59:04.26 --> 02:59:10.50
Fulness of information does not void the other principle that one thing at a time carefully

3006
02:59:10.50 --> 02:59:18.78
organized all down the line is the surest way, prioritizing execute.

3007
02:59:18.78 --> 02:59:24.34
There is no next, there is no excuse for malingering or cowardice during battle.

3008
02:59:24.34 --> 02:59:30.34
Is the task of leadership to stop it by whatever means would seem to be the surest cure

3009
02:59:30.34 --> 02:59:38.18
always making certain that in doing so it will not make a matter worse.

3010
02:59:38.18 --> 02:59:39.34
Next.

3011
02:59:39.34 --> 02:59:44.54
The armed services recognize that there are occasional individual school nervous and spiritual

3012
02:59:44.54 --> 02:59:49.98
makeup may be such that they are road rapidly and may suffer complete breakdown under combat

3013
02:59:49.98 --> 02:59:51.70
conditions.

3014
02:59:51.70 --> 02:59:58.42
They still may be a holy loyal and conscientious men capable of doing duty elsewhere.

3015
02:59:58.42 --> 02:59:59.78
Men are not alike.

3016
02:59:59.78 --> 03:00:05.02
In some, however, willing the spirit, the flesh may be too weak.

3017
03:00:05.02 --> 03:00:13.34
The punish, degrade or in any way, humiliate such men is not more cruel than ignorant.

3018
03:00:13.34 --> 03:00:17.94
When the good faith of any individual has been repeatedly demonstrated in the earlier service,

3019
03:00:17.94 --> 03:00:22.62
he deserves the benefit of the doubt from his superior pending study of his case by medical

3020
03:00:22.62 --> 03:00:23.62
authority.

3021
03:00:23.62 --> 03:00:28.26
But if the man has been a bad actor consistently, his officers were wanted in proceeding

3022
03:00:28.26 --> 03:00:33.90
on the assumption that his combat failure is just one more grave moral dereliction.

3023
03:00:33.90 --> 03:00:39.66
The failed to take proper action against such a man can only work unusual hardship on the

3024
03:00:39.66 --> 03:00:45.14
majority trying to do the duty.

3025
03:00:45.14 --> 03:00:46.14
Next.

3026
03:00:46.14 --> 03:00:50.78
The United States abides by the laws of war.

3027
03:00:50.78 --> 03:00:57.82
Its armed forces in dealing with all other peoples are expected to comply with the laws of

3028
03:00:57.82 --> 03:01:01.74
war in the spirit and to the letter.

3029
03:01:01.74 --> 03:01:06.62
In waging war, we do not terrorize helpless non-combatants.

3030
03:01:06.62 --> 03:01:12.98
If it is within our power to avoid doing so, want in killing, torture, cruelty, or the

3031
03:01:12.98 --> 03:01:19.30
working of unusual and unnecessary hardship on enemy prisoners or populations is not justified

3032
03:01:19.30 --> 03:01:22.38
under any circumstance.

3033
03:01:22.38 --> 03:01:28.78
Likewise, respect for the reign of law as that term is understood by the United States's

3034
03:01:28.78 --> 03:01:33.86
expected to follow the flag wherever it goes.

3035
03:01:33.86 --> 03:01:40.10
Piliging, looting, and other excesses are as a moral as unmoorled where Americans are operating

3036
03:01:40.10 --> 03:01:46.30
under military law as they are living together under civil code.

3037
03:01:46.30 --> 03:01:50.98
Nonetheless, some men in the American services will loot and destroy properly unless

3038
03:01:50.98 --> 03:01:54.54
they are restrained by fear of punishment.

3039
03:01:54.54 --> 03:01:58.06
War loses violence and disorder.

3040
03:01:58.06 --> 03:02:02.82
The inflames, passions and makes it relatively easy for the individual to get away with

3041
03:02:02.82 --> 03:02:05.70
unlawful actions.

3042
03:02:05.70 --> 03:02:11.06
But it does not lessen the gravity of his offense or make it less necessary that constituted

3043
03:02:11.06 --> 03:02:14.14
authority put him down.

3044
03:02:14.14 --> 03:02:21.02
The main safeguard against lawlessness and who lunagonism in any armed body is the integrity

3045
03:02:21.02 --> 03:02:23.86
of its officers.

3046
03:02:23.86 --> 03:02:29.98
And men know that their commander is absolutely opposed to such excesses and will take

3047
03:02:29.98 --> 03:02:36.78
forceful action to repress any breach of discipline they will conform.

3048
03:02:36.78 --> 03:02:44.26
But when an officer winks at any degradation by his men, it is no different than if he had

3049
03:02:44.26 --> 03:02:47.38
committed the act.

3050
03:02:47.38 --> 03:02:51.94
Remember that one, young leaders out there on the battlefield.

3051
03:02:51.94 --> 03:02:56.06
An officer winks at any degradation of his men.

3052
03:02:56.06 --> 03:02:58.62
There's no different than if he had committed the act.

3053
03:02:58.62 --> 03:03:04.70
And if you hold the discipline, if you hold the discipline, they will conform.

3054
03:03:04.70 --> 03:03:10.38
If they know where you fall, where you stand, I should say, if they know where you stand,

3055
03:03:10.38 --> 03:03:14.26
they will conform.

3056
03:03:14.26 --> 03:03:20.02
Next, on the field of sport, Americans always talking up to keep nerve steady and to generate

3057
03:03:20.02 --> 03:03:21.74
confidence.

3058
03:03:21.74 --> 03:03:25.94
The need is even greater on the field of war and the same treatment will have no less

3059
03:03:25.94 --> 03:03:26.94
effect.

3060
03:03:26.94 --> 03:03:31.30
When men are afraid, they go silent.

3061
03:03:31.30 --> 03:03:35.98
Silence of itself further intensifies the fear.

3062
03:03:35.98 --> 03:03:42.06
The resumption of speech is the beginning of thoughtful, collected action.

3063
03:03:42.06 --> 03:03:47.50
For self-evidently, two or more men cannot join strength and work intelligently together

3064
03:03:47.50 --> 03:03:50.02
until they know one another's thoughts.

3065
03:03:50.02 --> 03:03:57.02
Once a importantly, all training is an exercise in getting men to open up and become articulate,

3066
03:03:57.02 --> 03:04:06.94
articulate even as it is a process in conditioning them physically to move strongly together.

3067
03:04:06.94 --> 03:04:14.98
Once again, step and even talking is action that starts to dispeel fear.

3068
03:04:14.98 --> 03:04:19.50
Next, inspection is more important in the face of the enemy than during training because

3069
03:04:19.50 --> 03:04:25.38
a found piece of a found piece may mean a lost battle and overlooked sick man may infect

3070
03:04:25.38 --> 03:04:29.90
a fortress and a misled message can cost a war.

3071
03:04:29.90 --> 03:04:35.30
In virtue of his position, every junior leader is an inspector and the obligation to make

3072
03:04:35.30 --> 03:04:42.94
certain that his force at all times is inspection proof is unremitting.

3073
03:04:42.94 --> 03:04:49.70
And the last one I'm going to read to close out this book is here in battle crisis.

3074
03:04:49.70 --> 03:04:56.66
A majority of Americans present present will respond to any man who has the will and the

3075
03:04:56.66 --> 03:05:01.54
brains to give them a clear, intelligent order.

3076
03:05:01.54 --> 03:05:07.62
They will follow the lowest ranking man present if he obviously knows what he is doing

3077
03:05:07.62 --> 03:05:13.14
and is morally the master of the situation.

3078
03:05:13.14 --> 03:05:26.82
But they will not obey a chuckle head if he has nothing in his favor but his rank.

3079
03:05:26.82 --> 03:05:35.50
And that's it for this book and I think that closing statement.

3080
03:05:35.50 --> 03:05:39.06
Don't be a chuckle head.

3081
03:05:39.06 --> 03:05:44.54
Don't be a chuckle head and this is talked about earlier that they will follow the lowest

3082
03:05:44.54 --> 03:05:45.54
man.

3083
03:05:45.54 --> 03:05:51.46
The lowest-making ranking man present if he knows what he is doing and is morally the master

3084
03:05:51.46 --> 03:05:58.02
of the situation and can give a clear, intelligent order.

3085
03:05:58.02 --> 03:06:01.62
And I think the rest of you know if you're a chuckle head people are going to listen to

3086
03:06:01.62 --> 03:06:04.46
you just because of your rank and talk about that all the time.

3087
03:06:04.46 --> 03:06:08.90
You shouldn't use your rank.

3088
03:06:08.90 --> 03:06:17.92
And I think this book actually gives some pretty obvious ways to avoid being a chuckle

3089
03:06:17.92 --> 03:06:18.92
head.

3090
03:06:18.92 --> 03:06:28.98
Be humble, become, educate yourself, work out hard, physical, physicality is important.

3091
03:06:28.98 --> 03:06:32.66
It's all the stuff, same stuff that we talk about all the time.

3092
03:06:32.66 --> 03:06:35.42
And again, these are universal.

3093
03:06:35.42 --> 03:06:36.82
And I know we got a lot of listeners that are over.

3094
03:06:36.82 --> 03:06:43.14
See, this stuff is supplying to Americans for this applies basically worldwide at least

3095
03:06:43.14 --> 03:06:46.62
Western world.

3096
03:06:46.62 --> 03:06:48.18
And they've stood the test a time.

3097
03:06:48.18 --> 03:06:50.78
They work today.

3098
03:06:50.78 --> 03:06:53.54
So follow them.

3099
03:06:53.54 --> 03:06:57.98
And cold blind.

3100
03:06:57.98 --> 03:07:04.22
And lead with this lead and everything you do and start by leading yourself with these

3101
03:07:04.22 --> 03:07:15.42
principles because if you can't, there's no way that you can lead others if you can't

3102
03:07:15.42 --> 03:07:18.66
lead yourself.

3103
03:07:18.66 --> 03:07:23.46
And I'll tell you where little over the three-hour mark right now.

3104
03:07:23.46 --> 03:07:28.54
So it doesn't look like we're going to be doing Q&A this episode.

3105
03:07:28.54 --> 03:07:32.98
So if anyone is out, they're still listening at this point.

3106
03:07:32.98 --> 03:07:37.46
And they want to know how to support the podcast.

3107
03:07:37.46 --> 03:07:39.22
Echo, tell them how to do it.

3108
03:07:39.22 --> 03:07:42.82
Well, there's a few ways.

3109
03:07:42.82 --> 03:07:48.10
Yeah, so let's start with the, a lot of times I feel like I'm, it's just like kind of

3110
03:07:48.10 --> 03:07:49.10
repetitive.

3111
03:07:49.10 --> 03:07:50.22
Well, it is repetitive.

3112
03:07:50.22 --> 03:07:51.22
Yeah.

3113
03:07:51.22 --> 03:07:55.46
We've already had people listening for three plus hours at this point.

3114
03:07:55.46 --> 03:07:57.30
We can feel free to move quickly, I think.

3115
03:07:57.30 --> 03:07:58.30
Yeah, I think so.

3116
03:07:58.30 --> 03:07:59.58
But here's the thing though.

3117
03:07:59.58 --> 03:08:00.58
Oh, there's a butt.

3118
03:08:00.58 --> 03:08:02.54
I did, yeah, I did more thinking.

3119
03:08:02.54 --> 03:08:08.34
Where what if this is the first time somebody was listening or maybe the second time

3120
03:08:08.34 --> 03:08:10.14
won't be as repetitive.

3121
03:08:10.14 --> 03:08:15.86
Okay, but if it's person that they're going to listen to other ones, sure to go back.

3122
03:08:15.86 --> 03:08:18.34
Yep.

3123
03:08:18.34 --> 03:08:19.74
And they can listen to one of those episodes.

3124
03:08:19.74 --> 03:08:21.14
That's an hour and a half.

3125
03:08:21.14 --> 03:08:23.54
And they're going to be like, oh, I'm going to listen to a little bit more.

3126
03:08:23.54 --> 03:08:28.78
But right now, if we go long right now, they may not listen at all.

3127
03:08:28.78 --> 03:08:29.78
Yeah.

3128
03:08:29.78 --> 03:08:30.62
Now, some people say, what do it's fun?

3129
03:08:30.62 --> 03:08:31.62
We like that.

3130
03:08:31.62 --> 03:08:32.62
No.

3131
03:08:32.62 --> 03:08:33.62
No.

3132
03:08:33.62 --> 03:08:34.62
Nothing is fun after three hours.

3133
03:08:34.62 --> 03:08:35.62
I don't know.

3134
03:08:35.62 --> 03:08:36.62
I went long.

3135
03:08:36.62 --> 03:08:38.54
Well, there's so much good information in this book though.

3136
03:08:38.54 --> 03:08:39.38
I went long.

3137
03:08:39.38 --> 03:08:40.38
I'm sorry.

3138
03:08:40.38 --> 03:08:42.90
But I'm not really sorry.

3139
03:08:42.90 --> 03:08:43.90
There's a good information.

3140
03:08:43.90 --> 03:08:44.90
Yeah, that's the game.

3141
03:08:44.90 --> 03:08:45.90
It's good.

3142
03:08:45.90 --> 03:08:48.50
But I think we could proceed quickly.

3143
03:08:48.50 --> 03:08:49.50
That's what I think.

3144
03:08:49.50 --> 03:08:50.50
Yeah, sure.

3145
03:08:50.50 --> 03:08:51.50
I know no banter.

3146
03:08:51.50 --> 03:08:53.26
You know, I know you got things you want to talk about.

3147
03:08:53.26 --> 03:08:54.26
I'm not even in it.

3148
03:08:54.26 --> 03:08:55.26
With the stuff.

3149
03:08:55.26 --> 03:08:56.26
I'm going to avoid the banter.

3150
03:08:56.26 --> 03:09:01.74
The key here is really to, okay, look, I could, okay, we'll go into it on it.

3151
03:09:01.74 --> 03:09:06.86
Supplementation, you know, sometimes, hey, I don't need supplements.

3152
03:09:06.86 --> 03:09:10.66
I have a great diet or I'm just not into it just in general.

3153
03:09:10.66 --> 03:09:17.06
I have to successfully convey the importance of supplementation or at the very least the

3154
03:09:17.06 --> 03:09:18.06
value.

3155
03:09:18.06 --> 03:09:19.06
Go ahead.

3156
03:09:19.06 --> 03:09:21.06
So I'm not going to banter with you.

3157
03:09:21.06 --> 03:09:24.18
I'm just going to go ahead and get after it right here.

3158
03:09:24.18 --> 03:09:26.98
This far as late because you can, you know, all right.

3159
03:09:26.98 --> 03:09:32.06
You know, for a chocolate real quick, on it supplements, if you didn't already know,

3160
03:09:32.06 --> 03:09:38.02
krill oil or EDC, okay, our EDC, every day consumption of supplements, essential krill

3161
03:09:38.02 --> 03:09:40.54
oil for your joints.

3162
03:09:40.54 --> 03:09:43.06
And this is good because this is the legit one.

3163
03:09:43.06 --> 03:09:47.94
It's not the one where they kill a bunch of krill, grind them up and then sell it to you.

3164
03:09:47.94 --> 03:09:51.14
It's like the real deal that helps you.

3165
03:09:51.14 --> 03:09:56.30
I could tell you the story about how it helped me, but let's do the other, listen to the

3166
03:09:56.30 --> 03:09:58.86
other 52 podcasts if you want to hear that story.

3167
03:09:58.86 --> 03:10:04.94
Yeah, just understand if you're going for results on it supplements, krill oil, EDC, krill

3168
03:10:04.94 --> 03:10:10.38
oil, alpha brain, shrimp tech, warrior bars, even though those aren't really supplements,

3169
03:10:10.38 --> 03:10:11.94
they're like, but you do eat them every day.

3170
03:10:11.94 --> 03:10:14.86
Yeah, every day consumption.

3171
03:10:14.86 --> 03:10:17.50
And I got the, the pre-workout.

3172
03:10:17.50 --> 03:10:18.50
How was that?

3173
03:10:18.50 --> 03:10:19.50
Good.

3174
03:10:19.50 --> 03:10:20.50
I'm going to give it a shot.

3175
03:10:20.50 --> 03:10:22.06
Non-stimulate, by the way.

3176
03:10:22.06 --> 03:10:24.06
So that's not a gittery.

3177
03:10:24.06 --> 03:10:25.42
Yeah, nothing like this.

3178
03:10:25.42 --> 03:10:29.58
And it's, um, it's like there's like earth grown ingredients in there as well.

3179
03:10:29.58 --> 03:10:30.58
Good.

3180
03:10:30.58 --> 03:10:31.58
It's actually tastes good.

3181
03:10:31.58 --> 03:10:34.22
You know, so on it calls things earth grown ingredients.

3182
03:10:34.22 --> 03:10:36.14
I'm just going to like know it sounds cool.

3183
03:10:36.14 --> 03:10:37.14
Where else are they grown?

3184
03:10:37.14 --> 03:10:38.14
Space?

3185
03:10:38.14 --> 03:10:42.02
And when it's the cooler, if they grow, it's space or subterranean or something, what's

3186
03:10:42.02 --> 03:10:43.02
up?

3187
03:10:43.02 --> 03:10:44.02
Why are they trying to make it sound cool?

3188
03:10:44.02 --> 03:10:45.02
So what's good stuff?

3189
03:10:45.02 --> 03:10:46.02
How would they say that?

3190
03:10:46.02 --> 03:10:47.02
Well, the answer is grown.

3191
03:10:47.02 --> 03:10:49.78
The answer to that is lab grown.

3192
03:10:49.78 --> 03:10:53.70
If you can roast stuff in the lab or just concoct it, you know, chemically and

3193
03:10:53.70 --> 03:10:54.70
a lab quiet.

3194
03:10:54.70 --> 03:10:57.42
So I'm just saying that's the differentiator.

3195
03:10:57.42 --> 03:10:58.42
You win.

3196
03:10:58.42 --> 03:10:59.42
Which is good.

3197
03:10:59.42 --> 03:11:00.42
You win.

3198
03:11:00.42 --> 03:11:01.42
Earth grown is actually cool.

3199
03:11:01.42 --> 03:11:02.42
It's just a sound cool.

3200
03:11:02.42 --> 03:11:03.42
Okay.

3201
03:11:03.42 --> 03:11:04.90
And if there's any more questions.

3202
03:11:04.90 --> 03:11:05.90
I was thinking space grown.

3203
03:11:05.90 --> 03:11:09.58
I was thinking, I was thinking, I was thinking, move base alpha.

3204
03:11:09.58 --> 03:11:10.58
Yeah.

3205
03:11:10.58 --> 03:11:13.74
And if you can indicate the benefits of anything moon grown, I'm sure that they would

3206
03:11:13.74 --> 03:11:15.30
provide that on the website or whatever.

3207
03:11:15.30 --> 03:11:16.30
That's what I get it for me.

3208
03:11:16.30 --> 03:11:19.74
Anyway, alpha brain is proven as well.

3209
03:11:19.74 --> 03:11:24.34
That's the thing with neutropics, neutropicic to the help of your brain.

3210
03:11:24.34 --> 03:11:27.34
A lot of times people will be like, ah, that's a placebo thing.

3211
03:11:27.34 --> 03:11:30.42
They went through the real test to prove that it works.

3212
03:11:30.42 --> 03:11:34.06
Proven scientifically, fact that it's dope.

3213
03:11:34.06 --> 03:11:38.78
Anyway, on a dot com slash jockel, get 10% off if you want 10% off.

3214
03:11:38.78 --> 03:11:42.02
If you don't want 10% off, just go on a dot com.

3215
03:11:42.02 --> 03:11:43.02
Pay full price.

3216
03:11:43.02 --> 03:11:44.02
Boom.

3217
03:11:44.02 --> 03:11:45.02
Support everybody.

3218
03:11:45.02 --> 03:11:46.02
Everything.

3219
03:11:46.02 --> 03:11:47.02
Actually, not supporting anybody.

3220
03:11:47.02 --> 03:11:48.50
And you're definitely not supporting us.

3221
03:11:48.50 --> 03:11:50.50
If you don't do that, let's go.

3222
03:11:50.50 --> 03:11:56.02
Well, technically it is because it's like you're still getting your supplements.

3223
03:11:56.02 --> 03:11:59.70
You know, you're still getting supplementation.

3224
03:11:59.70 --> 03:12:00.70
We're just not getting the credit.

3225
03:12:00.70 --> 03:12:06.54
So just like if like you donate to a cause and you put anonymous in the thing.

3226
03:12:06.54 --> 03:12:08.34
And then you donate another 10% same thing.

3227
03:12:08.34 --> 03:12:10.34
To him saying anyway.

3228
03:12:10.34 --> 03:12:11.94
I'm going to just let this one go.

3229
03:12:11.94 --> 03:12:12.94
That's a good way.

3230
03:12:12.94 --> 03:12:15.98
Because I realize I'm guilty for making these things longer.

3231
03:12:15.98 --> 03:12:16.98
Because I'm interjecting.

3232
03:12:16.98 --> 03:12:17.98
I should just be quiet.

3233
03:12:17.98 --> 03:12:18.98
Yes, just be quiet.

3234
03:12:18.98 --> 03:12:21.98
Well, it's your podcast.

3235
03:12:21.98 --> 03:12:22.98
So you say whatever you like right here.

3236
03:12:22.98 --> 03:12:23.98
It's all our podcasts.

3237
03:12:23.98 --> 03:12:24.98
Come on.

3238
03:12:24.98 --> 03:12:28.58
So on it is one of the ways to support to wrap it up.

3239
03:12:28.58 --> 03:12:31.98
On the dot com slash jockel, get 10% off.

3240
03:12:31.98 --> 03:12:32.98
Help.

3241
03:12:32.98 --> 03:12:33.98
It's they're good.

3242
03:12:33.98 --> 03:12:34.98
Just trust me.

3243
03:12:34.98 --> 03:12:35.98
They're good.

3244
03:12:35.98 --> 03:12:38.98
Another good way.

3245
03:12:38.98 --> 03:12:39.98
Christmas is almost here, man.

3246
03:12:39.98 --> 03:12:40.98
It's like what?

3247
03:12:40.98 --> 03:12:41.98
Four, three, four days.

3248
03:12:41.98 --> 03:12:43.98
Something like that.

3249
03:12:43.98 --> 03:12:44.98
Something like that.

3250
03:12:44.98 --> 03:12:47.98
If you shop in Amazon, click through the website.

3251
03:12:47.98 --> 03:12:49.98
That's a good way to support.

3252
03:12:49.98 --> 03:12:54.98
Click through the website that's called jockelstore.com or call jockelpodcast.com.

3253
03:12:54.98 --> 03:12:55.98
Yeah.

3254
03:12:55.98 --> 03:12:56.98
Could it.

3255
03:12:56.98 --> 03:12:57.98
That's the website.

3256
03:12:57.98 --> 03:12:58.98
You got to click through.

3257
03:12:58.98 --> 03:12:59.98
Correct.

3258
03:12:59.98 --> 03:13:00.98
Yes.

3259
03:13:00.98 --> 03:13:01.98
Jockelpodcast.com.

3260
03:13:01.98 --> 03:13:03.98
Over on the side is Amazon little banner.

3261
03:13:03.98 --> 03:13:07.98
Click on that one before you do your image like Amazon shopping for Christmas or whatever.

3262
03:13:07.98 --> 03:13:09.98
Or buying any one of these books that the jockel talks about.

3263
03:13:09.98 --> 03:13:13.98
On the jockel store, you got to go on the menu item support.

3264
03:13:13.98 --> 03:13:14.98
And then I'll take you to the page with the bad.

3265
03:13:14.98 --> 03:13:15.98
Yeah.

3266
03:13:15.98 --> 03:13:20.98
Speaking of which podcast 100, as we talked about when Tim was on this podcast.

3267
03:13:20.98 --> 03:13:21.98
Tim Ferris was on this podcast.

3268
03:13:21.98 --> 03:13:27.98
We're going to do Musashi for podcast 100 because it's a big big big book.

3269
03:13:27.98 --> 03:13:28.98
Correct.

3270
03:13:28.98 --> 03:13:30.98
We need to get it on the podcast.

3271
03:13:30.98 --> 03:13:32.98
So that will be on the website.

3272
03:13:32.98 --> 03:13:34.98
So you can buy that book now because it's the thick book.

3273
03:13:34.98 --> 03:13:36.98
And we're going to do it for podcast 100.

3274
03:13:36.98 --> 03:13:37.98
Right.

3275
03:13:37.98 --> 03:13:38.98
You can click through.

3276
03:13:38.98 --> 03:13:42.98
The other thing is that's beneficial about these ways of supporting the podcast.

3277
03:13:42.98 --> 03:13:45.98
No advertisements on the podcast.

3278
03:13:45.98 --> 03:13:49.98
Except for this here, which I guess could be considered an advertisement.

3279
03:13:49.98 --> 03:13:54.98
But I don't want to have the analpha commercial break.

3280
03:13:54.98 --> 03:13:55.98
Yeah.

3281
03:13:55.98 --> 03:13:56.98
We would like to present.

3282
03:13:56.98 --> 03:13:57.98
Yeah.

3283
03:13:57.98 --> 03:13:58.98
Don't.

3284
03:13:58.98 --> 03:13:59.98
Something that doesn't matter.

3285
03:13:59.98 --> 03:14:01.98
Are you tired of sleeping?

3286
03:14:01.98 --> 03:14:02.98
Right.

3287
03:14:02.98 --> 03:14:03.98
You know that kind of stuff.

3288
03:14:03.98 --> 03:14:04.98
Yeah.

3289
03:14:04.98 --> 03:14:05.98
So yeah.

3290
03:14:05.98 --> 03:14:06.98
The Amazon clicked.

3291
03:14:06.98 --> 03:14:07.98
That's a good one.

3292
03:14:07.98 --> 03:14:08.98
That's like because it doesn't cost you nothing.

3293
03:14:08.98 --> 03:14:09.98
It's like super easy.

3294
03:14:09.98 --> 03:14:14.98
And it's like you're kind of just in the whole game of just, you know, reinforcements support.

3295
03:14:14.98 --> 03:14:18.98
Amazon click through the website for you shopping.

3296
03:14:18.98 --> 03:14:19.98
Boom.

3297
03:14:19.98 --> 03:14:21.98
You can also subscribe to the podcast.

3298
03:14:21.98 --> 03:14:23.98
And that seems obvious.

3299
03:14:23.98 --> 03:14:28.98
But sometimes you know, back to this, you know, you talk about this sometimes.

3300
03:14:28.98 --> 03:14:29.98
Amazon.

3301
03:14:29.98 --> 03:14:32.98
So you can click through Amazon.

3302
03:14:32.98 --> 03:14:33.98
Right.

3303
03:14:33.98 --> 03:14:35.98
Let's say you're going to buy something that's not expensive.

3304
03:14:35.98 --> 03:14:37.98
Like a bunch of pens.

3305
03:14:37.98 --> 03:14:38.98
Sure.

3306
03:14:38.98 --> 03:14:42.98
You might think, oh man, I'm just going to go directly to Amazon because that's no big deal.

3307
03:14:42.98 --> 03:14:43.98
Right.

3308
03:14:43.98 --> 03:14:45.98
We don't need to support the podcast on this purchase.

3309
03:14:45.98 --> 03:14:46.98
Right.

3310
03:14:46.98 --> 03:14:47.98
There's two problems with that.

3311
03:14:47.98 --> 03:14:54.98
Number one, if no one bought their duct tape without clicking through, we wouldn't get any of the benefit of having the site there.

3312
03:14:54.98 --> 03:14:56.98
The other thing is.

3313
03:14:56.98 --> 03:15:00.98
You got to exercise daily discipline in all things.

3314
03:15:00.98 --> 03:15:01.98
That doesn't.

3315
03:15:01.98 --> 03:15:04.98
If you get my point is that if you get in the habit of doing it, then you'll be in the habit.

3316
03:15:04.98 --> 03:15:07.98
Otherwise, if you only do it sometimes, then the time you go out and buy.

3317
03:15:07.98 --> 03:15:09.98
A lawn mower.

3318
03:15:09.98 --> 03:15:15.98
Then you know, or somebody bought a set of golf clubs and remember that guy, he says, I just bought some golf clubs.

3319
03:15:15.98 --> 03:15:18.98
Like a $1,000 set of golf clubs clubs.

3320
03:15:18.98 --> 03:15:19.98
He clicked through.

3321
03:15:19.98 --> 03:15:21.98
You know, so that definitely supports the podcast.

3322
03:15:21.98 --> 03:15:22.98
Yeah.

3323
03:15:22.98 --> 03:15:25.98
But it's because he had the discipline, the the.

3324
03:15:25.98 --> 03:15:27.98
Reen forced.

3325
03:15:27.98 --> 03:15:29.98
Reiteration of doing it all the time.

3326
03:15:29.98 --> 03:15:31.98
So it's doing it just do it all the time.

3327
03:15:31.98 --> 03:15:32.98
That's my recommendation.

3328
03:15:32.98 --> 03:15:33.98
Yeah.

3329
03:15:33.98 --> 03:15:34.98
It is true man.

3330
03:15:34.98 --> 03:15:37.98
That's kind of the key is like to remember to do it.

3331
03:15:37.98 --> 03:15:39.98
And here's the and everyone's duct tape counts.

3332
03:15:39.98 --> 03:15:40.98
Yeah.

3333
03:15:40.98 --> 03:15:43.98
And the end here's the thing like you're under no obligation to do that.

3334
03:15:43.98 --> 03:15:48.98
I'm just saying, most times you be like, hey, I want to support podcasts.

3335
03:15:48.98 --> 03:15:51.98
It's cool because, you know.

3336
03:15:51.98 --> 03:15:55.98
But at the time of, you know, hey, and you might duct tape, I go, I do it.

3337
03:15:55.98 --> 03:15:58.98
I buy the duct tape and it's like, oh, I forgot.

3338
03:15:58.98 --> 03:15:59.98
Yeah.

3339
03:15:59.98 --> 03:16:01.98
You know, just to kind of avoid that kind of situation.

3340
03:16:01.98 --> 03:16:04.98
If you have it in your mind, that's really the key is to remember to do it.

3341
03:16:04.98 --> 03:16:06.98
Then you're living with the guilt.

3342
03:16:06.98 --> 03:16:07.98
No man.

3343
03:16:07.98 --> 03:16:09.98
Barely can go on.

3344
03:16:09.98 --> 03:16:10.98
Anyway, yeah.

3345
03:16:10.98 --> 03:16:15.98
So yeah, do that or subscribe to the podcast or and subscribe to the podcast.

3346
03:16:15.98 --> 03:16:16.98
I should say.

3347
03:16:16.98 --> 03:16:17.98
Yeah.

3348
03:16:17.98 --> 03:16:18.98
It seems obvious on iTunes.

3349
03:16:18.98 --> 03:16:19.98
You subscribe, but I don't know if you haven't already.

3350
03:16:19.98 --> 03:16:20.98
Subscribe.

3351
03:16:20.98 --> 03:16:22.98
That's a good way to support and leave a review.

3352
03:16:22.98 --> 03:16:23.98
If.

3353
03:16:23.98 --> 03:16:25.98
If you're compelled to.

3354
03:16:25.98 --> 03:16:27.98
Those reviews are pretty dope.

3355
03:16:27.98 --> 03:16:28.98
By the way.

3356
03:16:28.98 --> 03:16:33.98
I'm subscribed on YouTube. We are along with the podcast and video format.

3357
03:16:33.98 --> 03:16:35.98
We'll do some excerpts.

3358
03:16:35.98 --> 03:16:39.98
Stuff you can share with people that they don't, they don't have to commit to three hours.

3359
03:16:39.98 --> 03:16:43.98
And, you know, however long the case may be to listen to the whole podcast.

3360
03:16:43.98 --> 03:16:48.98
And just listen to the, you know, three minute, one minute, five minute even, you know, things about.

3361
03:16:48.98 --> 03:16:50.98
Whatever case maybe.

3362
03:16:50.98 --> 03:16:52.98
But whatever little excerpts, you know.

3363
03:16:52.98 --> 03:16:54.98
I think those are beneficial.

3364
03:16:54.98 --> 03:16:55.98
I think.

3365
03:16:55.98 --> 03:16:58.98
When people share that kind with me.

3366
03:16:58.98 --> 03:17:01.98
I think you can learn a lot.

3367
03:17:01.98 --> 03:17:02.98
Prischer.

3368
03:17:02.98 --> 03:17:05.98
I think there's, you know, a lot to be said for it.

3369
03:17:05.98 --> 03:17:06.98
But they're going to give you a.

3370
03:17:06.98 --> 03:17:07.98
Or.

3371
03:17:07.98 --> 03:17:09.98
We have a store.

3372
03:17:09.98 --> 03:17:10.98
Jockel has a store.

3373
03:17:10.98 --> 03:17:11.98
It's called.

3374
03:17:11.98 --> 03:17:12.98
So now you say, I have a store.

3375
03:17:12.98 --> 03:17:13.98
We have a store.

3376
03:17:13.98 --> 03:17:14.98
Not my store.

3377
03:17:14.98 --> 03:17:16.98
Yeah, but if I say,

3378
03:17:16.98 --> 03:17:17.98
Jockel has a store.

3379
03:17:17.98 --> 03:17:19.98
It's called Jockel store.

3380
03:17:19.98 --> 03:17:20.98
Okay.

3381
03:17:20.98 --> 03:17:21.98
Sounds kind of cooler.

3382
03:17:21.98 --> 03:17:22.98
Okay.

3383
03:17:22.98 --> 03:17:23.98
And original name too.

3384
03:17:23.98 --> 03:17:24.98
Yeah.

3385
03:17:24.98 --> 03:17:27.98
So I was trying to do that, but can you interrupt your, but that's cool.

3386
03:17:27.98 --> 03:17:29.98
There's some cool shirts on there.

3387
03:17:29.98 --> 03:17:30.98
Some layers on the shirts.

3388
03:17:30.98 --> 03:17:32.98
I'm going to let you look.

3389
03:17:32.98 --> 03:17:36.98
I'm going to let you see the layers on your own.

3390
03:17:36.98 --> 03:17:38.98
So go to jockelstore.com.

3391
03:17:38.98 --> 03:17:41.98
See if you can find the layers on the shirts.

3392
03:17:41.98 --> 03:17:46.98
I'm not saying to buy a shirt or a tank top or a hoodie or a star.

3393
03:17:46.98 --> 03:17:48.98
I'm not saying to buy one.

3394
03:17:48.98 --> 03:17:51.98
But if you feel compelled to buy one because you think they're cool, the layers hit you.

3395
03:17:51.98 --> 03:17:53.98
They resonate with you.

3396
03:17:53.98 --> 03:17:55.98
I don't like the word resonates.

3397
03:17:55.98 --> 03:17:56.98
Use it anyway.

3398
03:17:56.98 --> 03:17:58.98
If they resonate, get a shirt.

3399
03:17:58.98 --> 03:18:01.98
That's a good way to support.

3400
03:18:01.98 --> 03:18:03.98
Some patches too.

3401
03:18:03.98 --> 03:18:07.98
You know the ones that with the Velcro, the regulation.

3402
03:18:07.98 --> 03:18:08.98
Those are on there too.

3403
03:18:08.98 --> 03:18:11.98
Per your and other people's requests.

3404
03:18:11.98 --> 03:18:14.98
We have a lot of military and law enforcement that wanted.

3405
03:18:14.98 --> 03:18:15.98
Yeah.

3406
03:18:15.98 --> 03:18:16.98
Regulation size.

3407
03:18:16.98 --> 03:18:17.98
Yeah.

3408
03:18:17.98 --> 03:18:18.98
Second one.

3409
03:18:18.98 --> 03:18:19.98
In the field.

3410
03:18:19.98 --> 03:18:19.98
Yeah.

3411
03:18:19.98 --> 03:18:21.98
As they're crushing evil in the world.

3412
03:18:21.98 --> 03:18:22.98
Yeah.

3413
03:18:22.98 --> 03:18:23.98
They're on there too.

3414
03:18:23.98 --> 03:18:25.98
And whatever else, you think it's cool.

3415
03:18:25.98 --> 03:18:26.98
I'm going to redo the mugs.

3416
03:18:26.98 --> 03:18:29.98
They're going to be like a special like one.

3417
03:18:29.98 --> 03:18:31.98
Like a super high quality one.

3418
03:18:31.98 --> 03:18:32.98
The travel mugs.

3419
03:18:32.98 --> 03:18:33.98
Yeah.

3420
03:18:33.98 --> 03:18:34.98
And then yeah.

3421
03:18:34.98 --> 03:18:35.98
There you go.

3422
03:18:35.98 --> 03:18:38.98
And then a psychological warfare.

3423
03:18:38.98 --> 03:18:39.98
See that was a done.

3424
03:18:39.98 --> 03:18:40.98
That turned out good.

3425
03:18:40.98 --> 03:18:41.98
It did.

3426
03:18:41.98 --> 03:18:42.98
I'm going to tell you that.

3427
03:18:42.98 --> 03:18:46.98
I was listening to your explanation of what psychological warfare was.

3428
03:18:46.98 --> 03:18:47.98
You need to listen to it.

3429
03:18:47.98 --> 03:18:49.98
It is unclear.

3430
03:18:49.98 --> 03:18:50.98
You told the story.

3431
03:18:50.98 --> 03:18:53.98
But it was like, you know how we're talking to each other right now.

3432
03:18:53.98 --> 03:18:54.98
Yeah.

3433
03:18:54.98 --> 03:18:55.98
And you were telling you, kind of telling me the story.

3434
03:18:55.98 --> 03:18:56.98
Right.

3435
03:18:56.98 --> 03:18:57.98
But I know a bunch about it.

3436
03:18:57.98 --> 03:18:58.98
Yeah.

3437
03:18:58.98 --> 03:18:59.98
So when I listened to it, I said, you know what?

3438
03:18:59.98 --> 03:19:01.98
People that aren't that don't know what this is.

3439
03:19:01.98 --> 03:19:03.98
Are going to wonder what this is.

3440
03:19:03.98 --> 03:19:09.98
Echo ask me some questions about what I'm thinking about in certain situations of weaknesses.

3441
03:19:09.98 --> 03:19:10.98
Right.

3442
03:19:10.98 --> 03:19:12.98
Certain situations of weaknesses.

3443
03:19:12.98 --> 03:19:13.98
And he asked me a couple of minutes.

3444
03:19:13.98 --> 03:19:15.98
And I kind of told him, like, off the cuff.

3445
03:19:15.98 --> 03:19:17.98
Oh, I think about this and this.

3446
03:19:17.98 --> 03:19:19.98
And he's kind of got that looking as face when I know he's.

3447
03:19:19.98 --> 03:19:21.98
I know he's thinking of something.

3448
03:19:21.98 --> 03:19:23.98
So I said, oh, he's thinking of something.

3449
03:19:23.98 --> 03:19:27.98
And then the next day, you know, hey, we got to do record these.

3450
03:19:27.98 --> 03:19:31.98
So he, we came up with some more questions that Echo is like, oh, this is a good one.

3451
03:19:31.98 --> 03:19:32.98
This is a good one.

3452
03:19:32.98 --> 03:19:33.98
Came up with the questions.

3453
03:19:33.98 --> 03:19:39.98
And then I wrote down the answers and I read him into a microphone.

3454
03:19:39.98 --> 03:19:42.98
We recorded it because that's what Echo does.

3455
03:19:42.98 --> 03:19:48.98
And then he said, hey, I'm going to make this into because people ask for ring tones.

3456
03:19:48.98 --> 03:19:53.98
They want to be able to awake to, because they want to feel the wake to me.

3457
03:19:53.98 --> 03:19:55.98
A lot of rocks to stuff.

3458
03:19:55.98 --> 03:20:00.98
So he said, I'm going to put these on iTunes and put them for sale.

3459
03:20:00.98 --> 03:20:02.98
And I said, oh, well, if that's what you think.

3460
03:20:02.98 --> 03:20:07.98
So he, the album is called, so it's an album of clips.

3461
03:20:07.98 --> 03:20:09.98
They're like two or three minutes long.

3462
03:20:09.98 --> 03:20:12.98
They're from there for a cup.

3463
03:20:12.98 --> 03:20:15.98
They're for psychological warfare against moments of weakness.

3464
03:20:15.98 --> 03:20:16.98
Yes.

3465
03:20:16.98 --> 03:20:19.98
And we're in the most one with a weakness come when you want to get up in the morning.

3466
03:20:19.98 --> 03:20:23.98
So there's, there's actually, because I know that's a hard one for people.

3467
03:20:23.98 --> 03:20:28.98
There's three psychological attacks against the weakness of not getting out of bed in the morning.

3468
03:20:28.98 --> 03:20:31.98
There's psychological warfare against wanted to eat bad food.

3469
03:20:31.98 --> 03:20:34.98
There's psychological warfare against procrastination.

3470
03:20:34.98 --> 03:20:39.98
Just moments of weakness are covered in the psychological warfare album.

3471
03:20:39.98 --> 03:20:40.98
Very well covered.

3472
03:20:40.98 --> 03:20:42.98
And it's for sale in iTunes.

3473
03:20:42.98 --> 03:20:47.98
And you've got a search for juggle willing or psychological warfare.

3474
03:20:47.98 --> 03:20:52.98
It's a little bit hard to find because of the way iTunes is laid out because it's in spoken word.

3475
03:20:52.98 --> 03:20:54.98
But that doesn't drop down under music anyways.

3476
03:20:54.98 --> 03:20:55.98
It's kind of hard to find.

3477
03:20:55.98 --> 03:20:57.98
But it is on there.

3478
03:20:57.98 --> 03:21:02.98
And that is, in fact, another way to support the podcast because it is for sale.

3479
03:21:02.98 --> 03:21:04.98
Because people want to support the podcast.

3480
03:21:04.98 --> 03:21:08.98
And so they say, hey, how can we support the podcast?

3481
03:21:08.98 --> 03:21:12.98
And you know, we used to say people say, oh, do you have this thing where you can donate money?

3482
03:21:12.98 --> 03:21:13.98
We'll just give you money.

3483
03:21:13.98 --> 03:21:15.98
Oh, I don't want you just to give me money.

3484
03:21:15.98 --> 03:21:17.98
I want to give you something.

3485
03:21:17.98 --> 03:21:18.98
If you, you just don't give me money.

3486
03:21:18.98 --> 03:21:20.98
I'm not going to take it.

3487
03:21:20.98 --> 03:21:23.98
Well, well, there's been a public couple of people that have given money, which is awesome.

3488
03:21:23.98 --> 03:21:24.98
We appreciate it.

3489
03:21:24.98 --> 03:21:29.98
But for the general, for my general conscience, right?

3490
03:21:29.98 --> 03:21:31.98
Recipercation.

3491
03:21:31.98 --> 03:21:32.98
Want to give you something back.

3492
03:21:32.98 --> 03:21:33.98
So here's what we give you.

3493
03:21:33.98 --> 03:21:37.98
You give us money for the iTunes album.

3494
03:21:37.98 --> 03:21:38.98
You get something back.

3495
03:21:38.98 --> 03:21:42.98
And you know what you get back discipline in MP3 format.

3496
03:21:42.98 --> 03:21:43.98
That's what you get.

3497
03:21:43.98 --> 03:21:44.98
So check it out.

3498
03:21:44.98 --> 03:21:45.98
They're pretty, they're funny.

3499
03:21:45.98 --> 03:21:48.98
They're no screaming, but they're getting after it.

3500
03:21:48.98 --> 03:21:49.98
And the feedback that I've gotten is awesome.

3501
03:21:49.98 --> 03:21:50.98
Like everyone comes to it or so.

3502
03:21:50.98 --> 03:21:52.98
They're like, yeah, I've been out a bit every time.

3503
03:21:52.98 --> 03:21:53.98
Yeah.

3504
03:21:53.98 --> 03:21:56.98
I, I over, you know, I didn't procrastinate on this project.

3505
03:21:56.98 --> 03:21:57.98
I'm going to do that.

3506
03:21:57.98 --> 03:22:01.98
Debbie said, I got this project done a week early because I didn't want to procrastinate.

3507
03:22:01.98 --> 03:22:04.98
You know, but two side notes to that one.

3508
03:22:04.98 --> 03:22:09.98
So if you're going to do the alarm clock thing, this is the last time.

3509
03:22:09.98 --> 03:22:13.98
Clear it with your, whoever you're sleeping with your wife or whatever.

3510
03:22:13.98 --> 03:22:17.98
Just make sure they have the heads up because if they hear it, they're going to flip out.

3511
03:22:17.98 --> 03:22:19.98
Yeah, and they won't flip out because I'm going crazy.

3512
03:22:19.98 --> 03:22:22.98
They'll flip out because all of a sudden there's a man in the real talking.

3513
03:22:22.98 --> 03:22:23.98
Yeah.

3514
03:22:23.98 --> 03:22:24.98
That's enough to freak so bad.

3515
03:22:24.98 --> 03:22:25.98
Okay.

3516
03:22:25.98 --> 03:22:26.98
You got, you know, one.

3517
03:22:26.98 --> 03:22:27.98
Yeah.

3518
03:22:27.98 --> 03:22:28.98
Yeah.

3519
03:22:28.98 --> 03:22:29.98
It's a kind of go over it.

3520
03:22:29.98 --> 03:22:30.98
You know, go over the plan.

3521
03:22:30.98 --> 03:22:31.98
You don't want to freak people out.

3522
03:22:31.98 --> 03:22:32.98
Yeah.

3523
03:22:32.98 --> 03:22:34.98
You're significant other were reaching for their side arm.

3524
03:22:34.98 --> 03:22:35.98
Yeah.

3525
03:22:35.98 --> 03:22:36.98
You don't know.

3526
03:22:36.98 --> 03:22:38.98
Put in laser on around the room searching.

3527
03:22:38.98 --> 03:22:40.98
And a second side note.

3528
03:22:40.98 --> 03:22:43.98
Good feedback for sure.

3529
03:22:43.98 --> 03:22:46.98
But it's been, I look at the stats sometimes.

3530
03:22:46.98 --> 03:22:48.98
It's been number one.

3531
03:22:48.98 --> 03:22:51.98
And spoken word category on iTunes.

3532
03:22:51.98 --> 03:22:52.98
Number one.

3533
03:22:52.98 --> 03:22:53.98
That's pretty good.

3534
03:22:53.98 --> 03:22:56.98
There's some other good people on that list, but it's been number one.

3535
03:22:56.98 --> 03:22:57.98
That's awesome.

3536
03:22:57.98 --> 03:22:59.98
I think since I put, we put it on there.

3537
03:22:59.98 --> 03:23:03.98
Anyway, well, thank you everyone. Yeah, everyone that's picking that up.

3538
03:23:03.98 --> 03:23:04.98
Thank you.

3539
03:23:04.98 --> 03:23:05.98
Appreciate that.

3540
03:23:05.98 --> 03:23:06.98
It's awesome.

3541
03:23:06.98 --> 03:23:09.98
But yeah, those are, yeah, solid ways to support.

3542
03:23:09.98 --> 03:23:15.98
Couple other ways that you can support this one is you can get some juggle white tea.

3543
03:23:15.98 --> 03:23:16.98
It's probably great.

3544
03:23:16.98 --> 03:23:17.98
It's probably great.

3545
03:23:17.98 --> 03:23:18.98
It's probably great.

3546
03:23:18.98 --> 03:23:19.98
It's great.

3547
03:23:19.98 --> 03:23:20.98
Can get some of that stuff.

3548
03:23:20.98 --> 03:23:24.98
If you haven't gotten it and you think I don't like tea.

3549
03:23:24.98 --> 03:23:26.98
You're wrong.

3550
03:23:26.98 --> 03:23:31.98
Because you haven't tried this tea because it tastes, it doesn't taste, I'm telling you, it doesn't taste.

3551
03:23:31.98 --> 03:23:32.98
I don't know what it tastes like.

3552
03:23:32.98 --> 03:23:33.98
You know what it tastes like?

3553
03:23:33.98 --> 03:23:34.98
It tastes like what it tastes like.

3554
03:23:34.98 --> 03:23:36.98
There's nothing else that you compare to.

3555
03:23:36.98 --> 03:23:38.98
It just tastes good, really good.

3556
03:23:38.98 --> 03:23:41.98
And it's got a little bit of caffeine in it.

3557
03:23:41.98 --> 03:23:44.98
You can actually drink it before you go to bed if you need to.

3558
03:23:44.98 --> 03:23:45.98
You won't, and won't keep you up.

3559
03:23:45.98 --> 03:23:47.98
It's not that kind of caffeine.

3560
03:23:47.98 --> 03:23:48.98
It's different kinds of things.

3561
03:23:48.98 --> 03:23:50.98
It's earth-grown caffeine.

3562
03:23:50.98 --> 03:23:54.98
It's kind of caffeine that there's not a lot in there.

3563
03:23:54.98 --> 03:23:56.98
It's got antioxidants in there.

3564
03:23:56.98 --> 03:23:57.98
And it tastes really good.

3565
03:23:57.98 --> 03:24:03.98
And you can have it pre-work out post-work out pre-meal, post-meal, pre-bed after bed during bed.

3566
03:24:03.98 --> 03:24:05.98
You can get it out of it whenever you want.

3567
03:24:05.98 --> 03:24:07.98
So that's the chocolate white tea.

3568
03:24:07.98 --> 03:24:08.98
You can get that.

3569
03:24:08.98 --> 03:24:10.98
And by the way, it's now been in stock.

3570
03:24:10.98 --> 03:24:13.98
I'm going on like three or four or five days.

3571
03:24:13.98 --> 03:24:14.98
It's in stock now.

3572
03:24:14.98 --> 03:24:15.98
We've got a better system.

3573
03:24:15.98 --> 03:24:16.98
We might have another fay.

3574
03:24:16.98 --> 03:24:18.98
And I got some stuff on the horizon.

3575
03:24:18.98 --> 03:24:20.98
There might be a little dip in the system.

3576
03:24:20.98 --> 03:24:23.98
But it's in stock in the tin.

3577
03:24:23.98 --> 03:24:25.98
The luxurious tin?

3578
03:24:25.98 --> 03:24:26.98
The luxurious?

3579
03:24:26.98 --> 03:24:27.98
The luxurious?

3580
03:24:27.98 --> 03:24:30.98
Or the big box, which has a hundred in it.

3581
03:24:30.98 --> 03:24:31.98
But reload.

3582
03:24:31.98 --> 03:24:32.98
Reload.

3583
03:24:32.98 --> 03:24:33.98
And then you can get a mug.

3584
03:24:33.98 --> 03:24:34.98
You can get a mug, by the way.

3585
03:24:34.98 --> 03:24:35.98
The mug.

3586
03:24:35.98 --> 03:24:37.98
It'll tell you what to do.

3587
03:24:37.98 --> 03:24:38.98
It'll tell you what to do.

3588
03:24:38.98 --> 03:24:39.98
Every single time.

3589
03:24:39.98 --> 03:24:40.98
They won't tell you to do.

3590
03:24:40.98 --> 03:24:41.98
It's good after it.

3591
03:24:41.98 --> 03:24:44.98
To get that mug on their chocolate proved.

3592
03:24:44.98 --> 03:24:46.98
And then extreme ownership.

3593
03:24:46.98 --> 03:24:47.98
The book, Christmas.

3594
03:24:47.98 --> 03:24:51.98
Why not get it for every single person you've ever known in your life?

3595
03:24:51.98 --> 03:24:52.98
You might as well.

3596
03:24:52.98 --> 03:24:53.98
No.

3597
03:24:53.98 --> 03:24:54.98
Extreme ownership.

3598
03:24:54.98 --> 03:24:59.98
If you listen to the podcast and kind of like what we talk about here, the book, extreme ownership.

3599
03:24:59.98 --> 03:25:00.98
It's about the same thing.

3600
03:25:00.98 --> 03:25:02.98
It's about combat leadership.

3601
03:25:02.98 --> 03:25:04.98
Also speaking of extreme ownership.

3602
03:25:04.98 --> 03:25:10.98
Again, New York City may fourth and fifth.

3603
03:25:10.98 --> 03:25:12.98
We're doing the extreme ownership.

3604
03:25:12.98 --> 03:25:13.98
Mustard.

3605
03:25:13.98 --> 03:25:14.98
Number 002.

3606
03:25:14.98 --> 03:25:19.98
The last one was 001 in San Diego.

3607
03:25:19.98 --> 03:25:22.98
This one is 002 May fourth and fifth at the Marriott.

3608
03:25:22.98 --> 03:25:26.98
We're going deep on combat leadership.

3609
03:25:26.98 --> 03:25:31.98
Which means we're going deep on all leadership because the principles do not change.

3610
03:25:31.98 --> 03:25:32.98
That's cool.

3611
03:25:32.98 --> 03:25:33.98
Everybody that's there.

Every industry you can think of.

3616
03:25:40.98 --> 03:25:41.98
And life's going to be there.

3617
03:25:41.98 --> 03:25:42.98
Echo is going to be there.

3618
03:25:42.98 --> 03:25:44.98
J.P. is going to be there.

We'll be interacting hanging out doing what if we're going to do.

03:26:05.98 --> 03:26:06.98
Mustard.

And as soon as those videos come out, it's going to sell out.

3628
03:26:08.98 --> 03:26:10.98
Because I've already seen the footage.

3629
03:26:10.98 --> 03:26:11.98
It looks awesome.

3630
03:26:11.98 --> 03:26:12.98
It is awesome.

3631
03:26:12.98 --> 03:26:12.98
It was awesome.

3632
03:26:12.98 --> 03:26:14.98

03:26:24.98 --> 03:26:26.98
If you want to ask questions or get that discount.

3639
03:26:26.98 --> 03:26:31.98
Also, if you have like 10, 12 people coming from your coming from your company,

3640
03:26:31.98 --> 03:26:33.98
we can get a discount going there too.

3641
03:26:33.98 --> 03:26:35.98
You can email,

3642
03:26:35.98 --> 03:26:38.98
Mustard at echelonfront.com.

3643
03:26:38.98 --> 03:26:41.98
You can also check out the website.

3644
03:26:41.98 --> 03:26:45.98
Extremeownership.com, real original.

3645
03:26:45.98 --> 03:26:46.98
We thought of that one.

3646
03:26:46.98 --> 03:26:51.98
And we look forward to seeing you guys there in the meantime.

3647
03:26:51.98 --> 03:26:55.98
If you want to kind of kick it with us,

3648
03:26:55.98 --> 03:27:01.98
we are kicking it ourselves on the interwebs on Twitter,

3649
03:27:01.98 --> 03:27:04.98
on Instagram as well.

3650
03:27:04.98 --> 03:27:06.98
And also we're going to be on that one.

3651
03:27:06.98 --> 03:27:07.98
That face book.

3652
03:27:07.98 --> 03:27:11.98
We're going to be there.

3653
03:27:11.98 --> 03:27:18.98
Echo is at echel Charles and I am at Jocquillic.

3654
03:27:18.98 --> 03:27:22.98
And finally,

3655
03:27:22.98 --> 03:27:26.98
go out there and execute.

3656
03:27:26.98 --> 03:27:30.98
And we talk a lot about a lot of different subjects on this podcast.

3657
03:27:30.98 --> 03:27:34.98
And we hear from incredible leaders and the lessons that we learned today.

3658
03:27:34.98 --> 03:27:41.98
Lessons that were learned and lessons that are written in blood.

3659
03:27:41.98 --> 03:27:45.98
But those lessons are meaningless.

3660
03:27:45.98 --> 03:27:50.98
They're meaningless if you don't execute on them.

3661
03:27:50.98 --> 03:27:53.98
If you listen without doing,

3662
03:27:53.98 --> 03:27:56.98
you might as well not even waste your time.

3663
03:27:56.98 --> 03:27:58.98
Just keep being arrogant,

3664
03:27:58.98 --> 03:28:00.98
wasting your time not being productive,

3665
03:28:00.98 --> 03:28:03.98
and not living up to your potential.

3666
03:28:03.98 --> 03:28:13.98
Just keep wasting your life if you're not going to execute on what we learned.

3667
03:28:13.98 --> 03:28:16.98
But if you listen,

3668
03:28:16.98 --> 03:28:19.98
and then you go and you do,

3669
03:28:19.98 --> 03:28:21.98
then stay on it.

3670
03:28:21.98 --> 03:28:25.98
And remember also that the rewards don't come easy.

3671
03:28:25.98 --> 03:28:30.98
Don't count on any glory.

3672
03:28:30.98 --> 03:28:40.98
Just hold the line and stay on the path so that you know.

3673
03:28:40.98 --> 03:28:49.98
So that you know that you are in the game 100%.

3674
03:28:49.98 --> 03:28:58.98
And that you know that you are getting after it.

3675
03:28:58.98 --> 03:29:01.98
So until next time,

3676
03:29:01.98 --> 03:29:05.98
this is echo and juggle.

3677
03:29:05.98 --> 03:29:32.98
Out.
