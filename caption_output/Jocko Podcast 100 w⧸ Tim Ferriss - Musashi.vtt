00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.56
This is Jockel podcast number 100 with echo Charles and me jockel willing good evening echo good evening

2
00:00:08.28 --> 00:00:11.46
And we have a guest with us tonight who is

3
00:00:12.72 --> 00:00:17.92
In large part responsible for this podcast existing in the first place

4
00:00:18.80 --> 00:00:22.80
Who has provided massive support behind pretty much everything I've done

5
00:00:22.80 --> 00:00:29.40
Including books and podcasts and events and all this other stuff that I've been getting after for the last couple years

6
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Since I departed the shadows and

7
00:00:34.92 --> 00:00:42.20
stepped into the normal world in fact. This is the person that pulled me from the shadows into the normal world

8
00:00:42.72 --> 00:00:45.72
Mr. Tim Ferris Tim

9
00:00:46.36 --> 00:00:50.32
Welcome to the show. Thank you for having me jockel and we have you in an

10
00:00:50.32 --> 00:00:52.32
An interesting state right now

11
00:00:53.80 --> 00:00:58.12
You do because you just got done with a 10 day

12
00:01:00.04 --> 00:01:06.76
Silent retreat and a five day fast embedded in there somewhere right I did so is my first

13
00:01:06.76 --> 00:01:13.40
10 day you know what you know what my notes weren't here after I said that my notes are dude question mark like dude

14
00:01:13.40 --> 00:01:15.40
Dude

15
00:01:15.40 --> 00:01:18.36
Because that's what makes me think just like dude

16
00:01:18.76 --> 00:01:27.48
Okay, tell us about it a little bit. I know you'll probably cover it. It was it was in retrospect probably layering a few too many things on top of one another

17
00:01:27.48 --> 00:01:29.48
But it was my first

18
00:01:30.80 --> 00:01:34.48
Meditation retreat also my first silent retreat combined and

19
00:01:35.60 --> 00:01:38.80
Consistitive 10 days of waking up at 530 and

20
00:01:38.80 --> 00:01:44.48
I support that part in the beginning. I know it's sleeping in but starting at 530

21
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
hadn't woken up with the stars in a while and

22
00:01:47.80 --> 00:01:57.16
then sitting for 45 minutes of meditation walking for 45 minutes of meditation and doing that until 9pm with the exception of meals

23
00:01:57.16 --> 00:02:03.04
But as you mentioned I fasted for the first five days out of 10 because I wanted to see how that affected my state and

24
00:02:03.04 --> 00:02:08.68
and I sat during meals effectively meaning

25
00:02:09.24 --> 00:02:12.96
Meditated during those times as well and it was an intense

26
00:02:14.44 --> 00:02:22.96
Unexpectedly intense experience because it unlayers your psyche in a fashion that I hadn't experienced before since you have no distractions

27
00:02:22.96 --> 00:02:26.24
You're not permitted to read there's no music

28
00:02:26.96 --> 00:02:30.36
There's no talking you're discouraged from any writing

29
00:02:30.36 --> 00:02:32.36
There are no devices and

30
00:02:33.56 --> 00:02:40.96
That means there's no real escape from whatever is rick ashing inside your own head and as you go through the

31
00:02:41.96 --> 00:02:44.96
passing days you drop into

32
00:02:45.72 --> 00:02:54.32
deeper layers of your personality and the stories that you've constructed for yourself as well as direct experience in memories that you haven't thought of in my case

33
00:02:54.32 --> 00:03:03.64
2025 years 30 years 35 years in some cases these very vivid intense memories that come back and so people have

34
00:03:05.48 --> 00:03:10.88
a very difficult time at points and the teachers are there every other day to

35
00:03:11.56 --> 00:03:18.04
interact on a one-on-one basis to ensure that people don't have a complete psychotic break I suppose

36
00:03:18.96 --> 00:03:20.96
Did you hear

37
00:03:20.96 --> 00:03:26.96
Random question, but would you hear people like crying yeah in their rooms or whatever heard people crying?

38
00:03:28.80 --> 00:03:32.40
Definitely heard people crying people went through a lot of

39
00:03:34.32 --> 00:03:40.48
pain and there were sublime experiences as well in moments of deep clarity or

40
00:03:43.12 --> 00:03:48.52
alleviation of suffering but I I think that and I was as actually just

41
00:03:48.52 --> 00:03:52.24
Looking forward to describing the experience to our mutual friend

42
00:03:53.12 --> 00:03:56.40
Dr. Peter Tia who may be the most like cerebral

43
00:03:57.20 --> 00:03:59.20
intense impatient

44
00:03:59.20 --> 00:04:03.84
And a little person I've ever met to agree that even I find hilarious which is

45
00:04:04.80 --> 00:04:08.28
difficult to achieve in this world in this life and

46
00:04:09.16 --> 00:04:11.16
his level of obsession and

47
00:04:11.80 --> 00:04:14.52
perseverating on concepts and

48
00:04:14.52 --> 00:04:19.76
endlessly makes me want to do a second retreat with Peter

49
00:04:20.28 --> 00:04:25.68
When he's not allowed to tell me how he's feeling because I think the more you have

50
00:04:26.16 --> 00:04:30.08
Run your life through your prefrontal cortex the heart of you fall and

51
00:04:33.12 --> 00:04:37.76
I would not recommend it for most people really because I would have left

52
00:04:38.44 --> 00:04:43.22
The retreat three or four times probably were it not for one particular teacher

53
00:04:43.22 --> 00:04:48.62
Who had decades of experience with tens of thousands of retreating

54
00:04:49.94 --> 00:04:56.06
Because I felt like I was going to leave in worship that I came in that I had regressed

55
00:04:56.78 --> 00:05:02.22
to a very reactive emotional state and that it was going to be a huge

56
00:05:02.22 --> 00:05:08.22
handicap when I left I felt like I was regressing tremendously and he was able to

57
00:05:08.22 --> 00:05:15.06
Write the ship a little bit along the way, but if if he had not been there and I had left

58
00:05:15.46 --> 00:05:17.46
Even on day nine I remember I was like

59
00:05:18.30 --> 00:05:22.10
People are supposed to be in this deep state of bliss or at least that was my perception

60
00:05:22.10 --> 00:05:26.98
I feel like I've just been rubbed rod all these nerves that I've numbed

61
00:05:27.86 --> 00:05:28.86
from

62
00:05:28.86 --> 00:05:31.82
difficult experiences in childhood and so on

63
00:05:31.82 --> 00:05:38.74
I have just been exposed to the surface so I think it's I think it requires a high level of supervision and

64
00:05:39.14 --> 00:05:42.14
This may not be the the forum for

65
00:05:42.74 --> 00:05:47.54
Discussing what I'm about to say but for those people who have the experience it might make some sense

66
00:05:48.22 --> 00:05:50.58
it had the characteristics of a very

67
00:05:54.42 --> 00:06:00.18
A very strong psychedelic experience but laid out over ten days where there's no escape

68
00:06:00.18 --> 00:06:03.86
So instead of ripping off the band aid you are

69
00:06:05.38 --> 00:06:09.38
Being exposed to facets of your life and

70
00:06:12.06 --> 00:06:15.70
Character that perhaps you have not faced in decades

71
00:06:16.42 --> 00:06:18.42
So yeah, it was a fun time days

72
00:06:20.14 --> 00:06:25.46
We get when you get to sleep deprivation which I've gone through some significantly sleep deprivation

73
00:06:25.46 --> 00:06:31.10
You know you have those kind of you know you take a trip without leaving the farm type situations and for me it was nothing

74
00:06:31.54 --> 00:06:36.26
Nothing crazy or anything you know I remember seeing stop signs in the ocean and

75
00:06:36.98 --> 00:06:49.22
Traffic lights in the ocean and stuff like that's not crazy. Well, okay crazy, but it's not it wasn't some psychological sort of unpacking where I was meeting my former self or anything like that

76
00:06:49.22 --> 00:06:55.54
But yeah, you definitely that that's when I hear because I've never tried psychedelic drugs and

77
00:06:56.38 --> 00:07:04.30
When I would people talk about them to me it does not sound fun to me because I think that where I think that

78
00:07:04.50 --> 00:07:08.26
Where I would end up would not be I happy place and I don't really

79
00:07:09.30 --> 00:07:16.94
Need to hang out there very much and I should I should also say that I don't in the case of the silent retreat or in the case of

80
00:07:16.94 --> 00:07:18.94
Psychedelics do it for fun and

81
00:07:19.70 --> 00:07:22.34
And I've had a few people ask me

82
00:07:22.82 --> 00:07:29.90
Did you enjoy your experience? I had a few staffers afterwards. Oh, did you enjoy her a treat? I'm like I found it valuable

83
00:07:32.22 --> 00:07:34.94
I wouldn't use the word enjoy yeah, yeah

84
00:07:36.14 --> 00:07:40.82
Well, you obviously you're gonna unpack this thing and I'm sure you'll do awesome

85
00:07:40.82 --> 00:07:49.42
An episode talking about it as you look back on it right now your brain is it still still 70% there

86
00:07:49.42 --> 00:07:53.92
And they told us at the end which I thought was very appropriate because it applies to so many things

87
00:07:53.92 --> 00:07:59.34
They said or one of the teachers said you're you think you're normal right now and you're not you're very

88
00:07:59.46 --> 00:08:07.46
Hypersensitive your retreat is half done so it'll take 10 days the equivalent amount of time to reintegrate and get retethered

89
00:08:07.46 --> 00:08:13.78
And I remember thing to myself. I have fucking book lunch coming I don't have 10 days to gingerly walk my way back to reality

90
00:08:14.34 --> 00:08:16.34
But nonetheless

91
00:08:17.34 --> 00:08:21.52
That's true for so much right I mean it's if you have a book and your book is 90% done

92
00:08:21.52 --> 00:08:25.78
I'm right told a more seasoned writer when I was writing my second book

93
00:08:25.78 --> 00:08:28.74
I said I'm 90% done they said how congratulations you only a 50%

94
00:08:31.26 --> 00:08:36.62
Yeah, it's the trim work. It's just like building a house. There's the trim work that all that little stuff that takes

95
00:08:36.62 --> 00:08:39.30
longer than you think it's gonna take well

96
00:08:39.90 --> 00:08:41.90
So to just set the stage a little bit

97
00:08:42.38 --> 00:08:43.58
number one

98
00:08:43.58 --> 00:08:49.86
You were on the spotcast before which was an awesome episode and you talked about some of your hard experiences growing up and

99
00:08:50.10 --> 00:08:53.38
Going through college and actually having suicidal thoughts and

100
00:08:54.48 --> 00:09:00.50
Beyond that suicidal plans that was podcast number 50 and it really helped out a lot of people

101
00:09:00.50 --> 00:09:04.94
I got an immense amount of great feedback from people and so thank you for doing that

102
00:09:04.94 --> 00:09:12.14
And on that podcast we also briefly discussed a novel called

103
00:09:12.98 --> 00:09:14.98
Musashi and

104
00:09:14.98 --> 00:09:21.82
It's just this incredible book that you'd read and I had read and the ending of the book is just full on epic

105
00:09:21.82 --> 00:09:25.90
And it's also a thousand page book and it takes the whole the the the the

106
00:09:25.90 --> 00:09:32.14
The ending of the book is literally the last page and half so that's it you have to read a thousand page to get this thing

107
00:09:32.14 --> 00:09:37.74
This ending and we decided on that podcast that we would do do that book for podcast 100 so

108
00:09:38.22 --> 00:09:41.14
Here we are and we're gonna talk about the book

109
00:09:41.62 --> 00:09:43.62
Musashi by

110
00:09:43.62 --> 00:09:44.62
Eji

111
00:09:44.62 --> 00:09:52.62
Eji Kawah. Yeah, Eji you'll see Kawah and I'm just gonna accept the fact that I will be getting my Japanese pronunciation corrected

112
00:09:53.42 --> 00:09:55.42
All day long

113
00:09:55.42 --> 00:09:57.66
I won't correct it unless you want me to correct well

114
00:09:57.66 --> 00:10:03.66
Maybe after I get done with something you could tell me just gonna suck that's all there is too

115
00:10:07.82 --> 00:10:11.94
Now the book so if you don't know anything about it me motto, Musashi

116
00:10:12.46 --> 00:10:16.14
Great Japanese swordsman and he wrote the book the book of five rings

117
00:10:16.94 --> 00:10:19.26
And I actually covered that book on

118
00:10:19.26 --> 00:10:23.50
Podcast number 80 so if you haven't listened to 50 and if you haven't listened to 80

119
00:10:23.50 --> 00:10:30.86
Go listen to those two and it will give you some background which I don't want to spend a bunch of time on there because it's spend a bunch of time on it on that podcast

120
00:10:31.18 --> 00:10:37.98
But here's the basic understanding of whom Musashi was born into a samurai family around 1584

121
00:10:39.42 --> 00:10:46.50
Fought his first duel at the age of 13 against a grown man who he killed by throwing him to the ground and beating him with a

122
00:10:46.50 --> 00:10:49.22
Bokkin Bokkin Bokkin

123
00:10:49.22 --> 00:10:55.18
This is a wooden sword. So I should have just said wooden sword

124
00:10:57.62 --> 00:10:59.46
In that in and then through his life

125
00:10:59.70 --> 00:11:03.30
He traveled and he did all kinds of things and he fought

126
00:11:03.82 --> 00:11:05.82
60 sword duals

127
00:11:05.82 --> 00:11:12.14
I used to think that they were all to the death, but they actually weren't right there some of them were just like if I you could submit

128
00:11:12.14 --> 00:11:18.58
You know the opponent could just say yep, you won and you could agree to get beforehand what the rules of engagement would be

129
00:11:18.58 --> 00:11:23.94
Okay, so they could have a discussion and determine the extent to which you could inflict damage on the other person

130
00:11:24.94 --> 00:11:30.78
So they weren't all to the death they could have a basically gentlemen's agreements like let's not kill each other today

131
00:11:30.78 --> 00:11:33.90
It's only do this one to broken bones and

132
00:11:34.34 --> 00:11:38.50
Handy-capping how do you you got it you got a that's a hardcore

133
00:11:39.82 --> 00:11:45.74
Conversation yeah, how do you come off not looking like the the was you don't want to be the first one to say hey

134
00:11:45.74 --> 00:11:52.38
Let's just break bones today. Let's just break bones. Yeah, you just be like now we're going to the death. That's it. Yeah, that's weird

135
00:11:53.38 --> 00:11:57.30
But yeah, so but a bunch of them were to the death a lot a lot of them were to the death and

136
00:11:58.46 --> 00:12:00.30
again

137
00:12:00.30 --> 00:12:06.58
That then he got done with that all that fighting and he wrote the book of five rings. He also wrote a book or a

138
00:12:07.10 --> 00:12:09.10
Like steps called

139
00:12:09.46 --> 00:12:11.46
Doco do close

140
00:12:11.46 --> 00:12:17.46
Japanese has this this stutter constant for people who are wondering why am I at the the Japanese Consigly area

141
00:12:17.46 --> 00:12:21.94
It's it's because I lived in Japan. It's my first trip overseas

142
00:12:23.30 --> 00:12:24.66
Ever

143
00:12:24.66 --> 00:12:27.62
From 15 to 16 as an exchange student where I was the only

144
00:12:28.42 --> 00:12:35.06
Not as the only American in a a 5,000 person Japanese high school where I also wore a uniform and

145
00:12:35.38 --> 00:12:40.42
Did judo and lived with a Japanese family for an entire year so that is why I am commenting on Japanese

146
00:12:40.42 --> 00:12:44.18
Doco doco doco doco is a

147
00:12:44.18 --> 00:12:51.62
Alone call is to walk let's say do is wage it's the same door from judo or Iki do which is way

148
00:12:51.62 --> 00:12:53.62
So it's the way of walking alone

149
00:12:53.94 --> 00:12:59.06
Yeah, and I should have said that that's the reason why I thought it would be awesome to have you on here because you do have this

150
00:12:59.54 --> 00:13:03.78
Knowledge not only of the language of the culture and you did this you did you've done a bunch of

151
00:13:04.26 --> 00:13:08.50
Weird stuff cool yeah, yeah, yeah, I was I'm at Japanese horseback archery right

152
00:13:08.50 --> 00:13:12.26
Which by the way, also pretty dangerous turns out

153
00:13:12.74 --> 00:13:19.70
Yeah, yeah, and so that's what that's why I wanted to have you on here because you've got a map master amount of knowledge that I don't have

154
00:13:20.18 --> 00:13:22.34
So again in that that doco doco

155
00:13:23.46 --> 00:13:29.30
Close enough we're going with it. Let's roll it is is covered in podcast 80 as well and also

156
00:13:29.94 --> 00:13:31.14
This is

157
00:13:31.14 --> 00:13:37.54
A spoiler alert and I guess I should do this every time I do a book because I do books on here a lot and I always tell what's gonna happen

158
00:13:37.54 --> 00:13:39.54
But for this one

159
00:13:39.54 --> 00:13:46.66
This is a spoiler alert because the book it does have the most epic ending I think it most be it might be the the most epic ending of any book

160
00:13:46.66 --> 00:13:50.66
I honestly think that it might be that and we are going to cover it

161
00:13:51.30 --> 00:13:53.30
So if you want to read this book

162
00:13:54.42 --> 00:13:56.90
Then and we gave you about a year to read it if you haven't read it yet

163
00:13:57.62 --> 00:14:02.10
Maybe you're not gonna read it and you should just listen, but if you do want to read the book and get the full satisfaction of it

164
00:14:02.10 --> 00:14:10.66
Then stop right now and then go read Musashi take another year to read which is a thousand pages long and and then

165
00:14:11.54 --> 00:14:16.02
Come back and listen us so can I say one thing? Yeah, absolutely all right this book

166
00:14:17.38 --> 00:14:21.62
And when we can get back into some of the history, but I bought this book. I have a paperback version

167
00:14:22.74 --> 00:14:28.66
Decades go in Tokyo at a bookstore called Kino Kuniyai and Shinjuku. It's a huge bookstore

168
00:14:28.66 --> 00:14:31.38
It's I want to say at least four floors maybe six or seven

169
00:14:31.38 --> 00:14:33.86
And I carried it around giving myself

170
00:14:34.10 --> 00:14:37.70
Scoliosis for years and years because I was so intimidated by this thing

171
00:14:37.70 --> 00:14:42.10
It's a few inches thick the paper is it's like onion skin

172
00:14:42.10 --> 00:14:46.10
That's like oh god, it's can't every time I pick it up. It's oh god, I can't get into this

173
00:14:46.98 --> 00:14:52.42
Once I started I could not put it down and I finished it in a couple of days. I mean, it's it's that good

174
00:14:52.58 --> 00:14:55.54
So it's don't be intimidated by this by the size

175
00:14:56.26 --> 00:15:00.10
It's not it's not as much of a a slog as you would expect

176
00:15:00.10 --> 00:15:04.18
Once you get into it you just get sucked in and the read the writing is beautiful

177
00:15:04.42 --> 00:15:08.90
It's very clean very clean writing and the story is

178
00:15:09.54 --> 00:15:11.54
That's another thing I should say to is

179
00:15:11.54 --> 00:15:17.30
So there's a bunch of intertwining narratives in there about a bunch of different people and characters

180
00:15:17.30 --> 00:15:21.54
And they they all are interesting and impactful and and they all add to the story

181
00:15:21.94 --> 00:15:26.90
obviously for a couple hour podcast we can't get in all those and and really

182
00:15:26.90 --> 00:15:35.38
Will be hitting like this this the main plot line I guess but there's all these other things that are that are going on

183
00:15:35.38 --> 00:15:40.58
That we're just don't have time to touch on and that are that are really great to read about and there's so many

184
00:15:41.46 --> 00:15:50.66
If this guy would have been a screenwriter. Oh my god. Yeah the dialogue alone. Yeah, the book worth it. Yeah, it's it's just a great book and

185
00:15:50.66 --> 00:15:54.66
That's that

186
00:15:57.38 --> 00:16:03.14
I guess we might as well get into it a little bit and when we did when I did podcast 80 with the book of five rings

187
00:16:03.14 --> 00:16:05.14
I started with the beginning of this book and

188
00:16:05.94 --> 00:16:11.86
I said when I did that that when we do this book I'm reading it again because it's so legit

189
00:16:13.22 --> 00:16:15.22
So here we go

190
00:16:15.22 --> 00:16:24.10
Tacazzo all right. Tacazzo Tacazzo lay among the corpses there were thousands of them

191
00:16:25.38 --> 00:16:32.98
The whole world's gone crazy. He thought dimly a man might as well be a dead leaf floating in the autumn breeze

192
00:16:34.34 --> 00:16:37.62
He himself looked like one of the lifeless bodies surrounding him

193
00:16:37.94 --> 00:16:41.54
He tried to raise his head but could only lift it a few inches from the ground

194
00:16:41.54 --> 00:16:44.50
He couldn't remember ever feeling so weak

195
00:16:45.78 --> 00:16:48.02
How long have I been here he wondered

196
00:16:49.46 --> 00:16:55.54
Flies came buzzing around his head he wanted to brush them away but couldn't even muster the energy to raise his arm

197
00:16:56.82 --> 00:16:59.78
It was stiff almost brittle like the rest of his body

198
00:17:00.98 --> 00:17:02.98
I must have been out for quite a while he thought

199
00:17:03.94 --> 00:17:05.94
Wiggling one finger at a time

200
00:17:05.94 --> 00:17:11.78
Little did he know he was wounded with two bullets lodged firmly in his thigh

201
00:17:13.30 --> 00:17:21.30
Low dark clouds shifted ominously across the sky the night before sometime between midnight and dawn a blinding raid had

202
00:17:21.30 --> 00:17:22.90
Drenched the plane of

203
00:17:23.06 --> 00:17:25.06
Segi Jajara

204
00:17:25.06 --> 00:17:29.46
It was now passed noon on the 15th of the ninth month of 1600

205
00:17:29.46 --> 00:17:37.62
Though the typhoon had passed now and then fresh torrents of rain would fall on the corpses on the tickazos up turned face

206
00:17:39.14 --> 00:17:44.10
Each time it came he opened and closed his mouth like a fish trying to drink in the droplets

207
00:17:45.46 --> 00:17:50.98
It's like the water they wipe a dying man's lips with he reflected savoring each bit of moisture

208
00:17:52.18 --> 00:17:55.78
His head was numb his thoughts the fleeting shadows of delirium

209
00:17:57.62 --> 00:17:59.38
His side had lost

210
00:17:59.38 --> 00:18:01.38
He knew that much

211
00:18:02.42 --> 00:18:09.46
Hadiyaki supposedly an ally had been secretly in league with the eastern army and when it turned on

212
00:18:10.26 --> 00:18:13.70
Mitsunari's troops at twilight the tide of the battle turned to

213
00:18:15.30 --> 00:18:18.18
He then attacked the armies of the other commanders

214
00:18:18.50 --> 00:18:24.18
Yukita Shimazu Koneishi and the collapse of the western army was complete

215
00:18:24.18 --> 00:18:30.10
In only half a day is fighting the question of who would henceforth rule the country was settled

216
00:18:31.54 --> 00:18:36.74
It was Tokujawa Yasu the powerful edaiz dimo

217
00:18:38.42 --> 00:18:43.06
Images of his sister and the old villagers floated before his eyes

218
00:18:44.42 --> 00:18:46.42
I'm dying he thought

219
00:18:46.82 --> 00:18:48.82
Without a tinge of sadness

220
00:18:49.46 --> 00:18:51.46
Is this what it's really like

221
00:18:51.46 --> 00:18:55.54
He felt drawn to the piece of death like a child

222
00:18:56.34 --> 00:18:58.34
Mesmerized by a flame

223
00:19:00.98 --> 00:19:04.74
So that's how the book kind of kicks off and

224
00:19:07.14 --> 00:19:14.42
This guy was just born on the battlefield basically and is fighting in these savage battles as a as a kid

225
00:19:16.58 --> 00:19:18.58
as a kid

226
00:19:18.58 --> 00:19:23.22
And I think it's interesting that you start the book where a guy's about to die

227
00:19:23.46 --> 00:19:29.38
You know and I think that's there's something significant to that and it's not the only time in the book where he's about to die he

228
00:19:29.78 --> 00:19:31.78
He faces these bad situations

229
00:19:34.18 --> 00:19:36.18
over and over again and

230
00:19:39.62 --> 00:19:44.50
Again this we just have to fast forward through massive chunks of this book and

231
00:19:44.50 --> 00:19:50.18
I was just gonna make one comment absolutely for those people who are wondering why we're saying Tokizul

232
00:19:50.98 --> 00:19:52.98
So Tokizul is

233
00:19:54.10 --> 00:19:57.46
He's represented by the same two characters that can also be read as mousashi

234
00:19:58.18 --> 00:20:03.30
So there are different readings for characters and Japanese depending on if they are

235
00:20:03.86 --> 00:20:07.22
Adapted Chinese readings or native Japanese readings so mousashi

236
00:20:07.22 --> 00:20:16.02
Is the what would be called the the kunyomi or the Japanese reading and Tokizul same two characters would be the Chinese reading

237
00:20:16.58 --> 00:20:20.82
Basically I mean the Chinese origin reading which is called on yomi so it's the same person

238
00:20:21.14 --> 00:20:24.34
Tokizul and then mousashi are the Japanese and Chinese characters

239
00:20:25.06 --> 00:20:28.74
Related linguistically they are very very similar so the

240
00:20:30.26 --> 00:20:35.06
The Japanese took Chinese characters which they call kanji and

241
00:20:35.06 --> 00:20:42.82
They converted them into two what are referred to as syllabaries so we have an alphabet

242
00:20:42.82 --> 00:20:48.82
ABCD we have vowels and consonants in Japanese they have what are called syllabaries meaning

243
00:20:49.78 --> 00:20:53.46
They are syllables instead of individual letters so you have kaki kukikou

244
00:20:53.46 --> 00:20:56.90
Mami mume mama sashi tsuse sayesul and

245
00:20:56.90 --> 00:21:04.82
Which is part of the reason much Japanese have so much trouble with almost every language they kind of got robbed when like the gods were handing out sounds

246
00:21:05.30 --> 00:21:08.26
So they're trouble with a lot of languages

247
00:21:08.66 --> 00:21:10.66
Including English but

248
00:21:11.30 --> 00:21:13.30
nonetheless

249
00:21:13.30 --> 00:21:15.30
those were simplified

250
00:21:15.30 --> 00:21:17.30
versions of

251
00:21:17.30 --> 00:21:19.30
The characters so for instance the character for

252
00:21:20.34 --> 00:21:25.30
That you could say represents peace in Chinese which is unso if for instance like

253
00:21:25.30 --> 00:21:32.34
A piece the word in Chinese would be unchuan so I've spent time in China as well in Japanese it's unzing

254
00:21:32.34 --> 00:21:39.70
It's all it's very similar and then the character for un is has a roof and then a woman under a roof and that

255
00:21:40.26 --> 00:21:41.86
represents peace

256
00:21:41.86 --> 00:21:46.58
That was then modified into the sound a the vowel a and

257
00:21:47.14 --> 00:21:52.02
There are fewer strokes in that so that's some of the framework for

258
00:21:52.02 --> 00:21:58.74
The Japanese writing systems if two syllabaries and then the Chinese characters that they use

259
00:21:59.46 --> 00:22:05.38
The languages are not mutually intelligible though are they not at all now there are certain

260
00:22:06.42 --> 00:22:08.42
words that are

261
00:22:11.38 --> 00:22:13.38
Not terribly close but maybe

262
00:22:13.38 --> 00:22:17.62
What you would find say between Portuguese and Spanish in care for instance

263
00:22:18.26 --> 00:22:20.26
so you would have a word like

264
00:22:20.26 --> 00:22:23.38
Telephone which is literally a

265
00:22:23.78 --> 00:22:29.22
Electric talk which is and even electricity has cloud and

266
00:22:30.18 --> 00:22:34.98
Dragon underneath it was kind of cool but anyway the that's d'Ainwah in Japanese

267
00:22:35.70 --> 00:22:38.74
D'Anhwah in Mandarin and then j'Anhwah in Korean

268
00:22:39.70 --> 00:22:43.54
Because a lot of the words in Korea were also borrowed from the Chinese characters

269
00:22:43.54 --> 00:22:49.54
But beyond that the grammar everything else is completely completely different

270
00:22:50.66 --> 00:22:56.50
And well, I think I actually in here cover where he gets where he comes up with a new name or when he decides to take the new name

271
00:22:56.50 --> 00:23:00.66
Yeah, so the guy that I'm talking on the beginning is Tim just pointed out that is Musashi thick

272
00:23:00.66 --> 00:23:01.54
That's a

273
00:23:01.54 --> 00:23:02.54
Takazu

274
00:23:02.54 --> 00:23:04.54
Takazu, it's a Takazu

275
00:23:04.54 --> 00:23:07.54
The zool is a long oh so Takazu

276
00:23:07.54 --> 00:23:08.54
Takazu

277
00:23:08.54 --> 00:23:09.54
Takazu

278
00:23:09.54 --> 00:23:10.54
That is Musashi

279
00:23:10.54 --> 00:23:11.54
Exactly

280
00:23:11.54 --> 00:23:12.54
And you'll find that out shortly

281
00:23:12.54 --> 00:23:14.54
For those people who are watching the video

282
00:23:15.26 --> 00:23:16.54
That is

283
00:23:17.34 --> 00:23:20.54
Takazu and Musashi those two characters

284
00:23:20.54 --> 00:23:22.54
Oh okay anyway

285
00:23:22.54 --> 00:23:25.54
What's so what is that what is the rest of that thing to say at the bookmark?

286
00:23:25.54 --> 00:23:27.54
What is this this is the wrapping

287
00:23:27.54 --> 00:23:33.54
Oh that was put around the cover of this book in the English section in Kino Kuenyo bookstore

288
00:23:33.54 --> 00:23:38.54
So that people could figure out what the content was without without having to read the back jacket in English

289
00:23:38.54 --> 00:23:40.54
So this is

290
00:23:40.54 --> 00:23:42.54
Musashi, umiyo watajar

291
00:23:42.54 --> 00:23:46.54
Kokenimun ga kue so on and so forth and then Miyamoto Musashi

292
00:23:46.54 --> 00:23:48.54
And then Yoshikawa AG

293
00:23:48.54 --> 00:23:52.54
This is all here and then a little description on the back

294
00:23:52.54 --> 00:23:54.54
Are there

295
00:23:54.54 --> 00:23:56.54
Just copies of this

296
00:23:56.54 --> 00:23:58.54
Everyone read this in Japan this I

297
00:23:58.54 --> 00:24:01.54
And maybe Mr. remembering this

298
00:24:01.54 --> 00:24:03.54
But I remember at the time

299
00:24:04.54 --> 00:24:08.54
Looking at this book and reading about the

300
00:24:08.54 --> 00:24:12.54
As they would call it on the back cover the best selling samurai epic

301
00:24:12.54 --> 00:24:14.54
And somewhere

302
00:24:14.54 --> 00:24:16.54
Reading that this book has sold

303
00:24:16.54 --> 00:24:18.54
Something absurd like

304
00:24:18.54 --> 00:24:22.54
20 million plus copies in a country of

305
00:24:22.54 --> 00:24:24.54
Whatever might be 150 million people

306
00:24:24.54 --> 00:24:29.54
That seems now that I've been through the book process a few times

307
00:24:29.54 --> 00:24:31.54
Like it cannot be true

308
00:24:31.54 --> 00:24:32.54
But

309
00:24:32.54 --> 00:24:35.54
It is a very very very famous book in Japan

310
00:24:35.54 --> 00:24:40.54
And everybody's going to know who they would say Miyamoto Musashi

311
00:24:40.54 --> 00:24:42.54
So they would give the last name first

312
00:24:42.54 --> 00:24:44.54
Everyone is going to know who this guy is

313
00:24:44.54 --> 00:24:45.54
And they have

314
00:24:45.54 --> 00:24:48.54
I mean hundreds of comic books and so on

315
00:24:48.54 --> 00:24:51.54
Historical comic books, fictional comic books

316
00:24:51.54 --> 00:24:54.54
That have been written about Musashi

317
00:24:54.54 --> 00:24:56.54
Yeah

318
00:24:56.54 --> 00:25:00.54
And this thing originally came out in a series I think in

319
00:25:00.54 --> 00:25:05.54
1939 or 1933 or 1935 or something like that

320
00:25:05.54 --> 00:25:07.54
And it originally came out as a series

321
00:25:07.54 --> 00:25:10.54
I think in like a magazine or something

322
00:25:10.54 --> 00:25:12.54
You can get quite possibly

323
00:25:12.54 --> 00:25:14.54
Could be the case I don't know

324
00:25:14.54 --> 00:25:16.54
I'm pretty sure

325
00:25:16.54 --> 00:25:18.54
So we'll go with it

326
00:25:18.54 --> 00:25:22.54
Alright

327
00:25:22.54 --> 00:25:24.54
Now we are going to

328
00:25:24.54 --> 00:25:26.54
Get to a point again we're fast forwarding it

329
00:25:26.54 --> 00:25:29.54
And at this point Musashi has been

330
00:25:29.54 --> 00:25:34.54
A cues of murder and he's been hung from a tree

331
00:25:34.54 --> 00:25:36.54
And Takuan

332
00:25:36.54 --> 00:25:37.54
Takuan

333
00:25:37.54 --> 00:25:38.54
Takuan

334
00:25:38.54 --> 00:25:40.54
Takuan

335
00:25:40.54 --> 00:25:44.54
Is sort of this kind of traveling priest on any sort of counseling

336
00:25:44.54 --> 00:25:46.54
And advising

337
00:25:46.54 --> 00:25:47.54
And

338
00:25:47.54 --> 00:25:48.54
Yeah

339
00:25:48.54 --> 00:25:49.54
Just sort of

340
00:25:49.54 --> 00:25:50.54
Counting and advising

341
00:25:50.54 --> 00:25:52.54
Musashi at this point

342
00:25:52.54 --> 00:25:54.54
And

343
00:25:54.54 --> 00:25:58.54
He's kind of wandering around as Musashi's now been a cues of murder

344
00:25:58.54 --> 00:26:01.54
And hung up up in this tree where they're going to eventually kill him

345
00:26:01.54 --> 00:26:03.54
And here we go

346
00:26:03.54 --> 00:26:05.54
Going to the book

347
00:26:05.54 --> 00:26:06.54
Takuan

348
00:26:06.54 --> 00:26:07.54
Save me

349
00:26:07.54 --> 00:26:09.54
Takuzo's cry for help

350
00:26:09.54 --> 00:26:11.54
Was loud and plaintive

351
00:26:11.54 --> 00:26:14.54
The branch was beginning to tremble

352
00:26:14.54 --> 00:26:18.54
As though it as though the whole tree were weeping

353
00:26:18.54 --> 00:26:20.54
I want to be a better man

354
00:26:20.54 --> 00:26:22.54
I realize how important it is

355
00:26:22.54 --> 00:26:25.54
What a privilege it is to be born human

356
00:26:25.54 --> 00:26:29.54
I'm almost dead but I understand what it means to be alive

357
00:26:29.54 --> 00:26:35.54
And now that I know my whole life will consist of being tied to this tree

358
00:26:35.54 --> 00:26:38.54
I can't undo what I've done

359
00:26:38.54 --> 00:26:41.54
You're finally coming to your senses

360
00:26:41.54 --> 00:26:45.54
For the first time in your life you're talking like a human being

361
00:26:45.54 --> 00:26:47.54
I don't want to die Takazawa cried

362
00:26:47.54 --> 00:26:49.54
I want to live

363
00:26:49.54 --> 00:26:52.54
I want to go out try again do everything right this time

364
00:26:52.54 --> 00:26:54.54
His body convulsed with his sobbing

365
00:26:54.54 --> 00:26:58.54
Takuan please help me help me

366
00:26:58.54 --> 00:27:01.54
The monk shook his head

367
00:27:01.54 --> 00:27:03.54
Sorry Takazawa

368
00:27:03.54 --> 00:27:05.54
It is out of my hands

369
00:27:05.54 --> 00:27:07.54
It is the law of nature

370
00:27:07.54 --> 00:27:10.54
You can't do things over again

371
00:27:10.54 --> 00:27:12.54
That's life

372
00:27:12.54 --> 00:27:16.54
Everything in it is for keeps everything

373
00:27:16.54 --> 00:27:20.54
You can't put your head back on after the enemies cut it off

374
00:27:20.54 --> 00:27:21.54
That's the way it is

375
00:27:21.54 --> 00:27:25.54
Of course I feel sorry for you but I can't undo that rope

376
00:27:25.54 --> 00:27:28.54
Because it wasn't me who tied it

377
00:27:28.54 --> 00:27:30.54
It was you

378
00:27:30.54 --> 00:27:33.54
All I can do is give you some advice

379
00:27:33.54 --> 00:27:36.54
Face death bravely and quietly

380
00:27:36.54 --> 00:27:40.54
Say a prayer and hope someone bothers to listen

381
00:27:40.54 --> 00:27:43.54
And for the sake of your ancestors Takazawa

382
00:27:43.54 --> 00:27:47.54
Have the decency to die with a peaceful look on your face

383
00:27:47.54 --> 00:27:52.54
The clatter of Takuan's sandals faded into the distance

384
00:27:52.54 --> 00:27:55.54
He was gone and Takazawa cried no more

385
00:27:55.54 --> 00:27:58.54
Following the spirit of the monk's advice

386
00:27:58.54 --> 00:28:02.54
He shut the eyes that had just experienced a great awakening

387
00:28:02.54 --> 00:28:04.54
And forgot everything

388
00:28:04.54 --> 00:28:06.54
He forgot about living and dying

389
00:28:06.54 --> 00:28:09.54
And under the myriad of tiny stars

390
00:28:09.54 --> 00:28:13.54
Lay perfectly still as the night breeze sighed through the tree

391
00:28:13.54 --> 00:28:15.54
He was cold

392
00:28:15.54 --> 00:28:17.54
Very cold

393
00:28:17.54 --> 00:28:22.54
I mean obviously wrote a book called Extreme Ownership

394
00:28:22.54 --> 00:28:24.54
Where you're responsible for your actions

395
00:28:24.54 --> 00:28:26.54
And you need to take responsibility for things in your life

396
00:28:26.54 --> 00:28:29.54
But this thing where he says I can't untie the rope

397
00:28:29.54 --> 00:28:31.54
Because it wasn't me that was that tied it

398
00:28:31.54 --> 00:28:32.54
It was you

399
00:28:32.54 --> 00:28:34.54
You put yourself in this position

400
00:28:34.54 --> 00:28:36.54
And that's the way it is

401
00:28:36.54 --> 00:28:39.54
Once your head is caught off you can't put it back on

402
00:28:39.54 --> 00:28:41.54
Musashi

403
00:28:41.54 --> 00:28:45.54
Or Takazawa gets he does crazy stuff too

404
00:28:45.54 --> 00:28:47.54
He's young and he does crazy things

405
00:28:47.54 --> 00:28:51.54
One of the crazy things he does is his sisters in some kind of jail or something

406
00:28:51.54 --> 00:28:53.54
And he just like attacks it

407
00:28:53.54 --> 00:28:55.54
And he loses and he gets arrested

408
00:28:55.54 --> 00:28:57.54
And he gets put in prison for three years

409
00:28:57.54 --> 00:29:01.54
And at this point he's

410
00:29:01.54 --> 00:29:03.54
Getting released from jail

411
00:29:03.54 --> 00:29:05.54
After he's been in jail for three years

412
00:29:05.54 --> 00:29:08.54
And again obviously I just skipped three years of this guy's jail time

413
00:29:08.54 --> 00:29:10.54
Which actually is pretty short in the book

414
00:29:10.54 --> 00:29:12.54
He's spent a lot of time in jail

415
00:29:12.54 --> 00:29:14.54
But he's been in jail for three years

416
00:29:14.54 --> 00:29:16.54
He gets out

417
00:29:16.54 --> 00:29:20.54
And here we he's having a conversation

418
00:29:20.54 --> 00:29:22.54
And here we go

419
00:29:22.54 --> 00:29:24.54
Takazawa smiled silently

420
00:29:24.54 --> 00:29:26.54
I want to wander about on my own for a while

421
00:29:26.54 --> 00:29:30.54
And then Takawan who's back at that's who he's having the conversation with

422
00:29:30.54 --> 00:29:32.54
Sorry he says you should not change your first name to

423
00:29:32.54 --> 00:29:34.54
Takawan and interjected

424
00:29:34.54 --> 00:29:37.54
Why not read the Chinese characters of your name as Musashi

425
00:29:37.54 --> 00:29:39.54
Instead of Takazawa

426
00:29:39.54 --> 00:29:42.54
You can keep writing your name as the same as before

427
00:29:42.54 --> 00:29:47.54
It's only fitting that everything should begin a new on this day of your rebirth

428
00:29:47.54 --> 00:29:51.54
Miyamoto Musashi, it's a good name, a very good name

429
00:29:51.54 --> 00:29:53.54
We should drink to it

430
00:29:53.54 --> 00:29:55.54
The following day they both left the castle

431
00:29:55.54 --> 00:29:57.54
Musashi was talking

432
00:29:57.54 --> 00:30:00.54
Musashi was taking his first steps into a new life

433
00:30:00.54 --> 00:30:04.54
A life of discipline and training in the martial arts

434
00:30:04.54 --> 00:30:07.54
During his three-year incarceration

435
00:30:07.54 --> 00:30:11.54
He had resolved to master the art of war

436
00:30:11.54 --> 00:30:15.54
Explain the first last name thing

437
00:30:15.54 --> 00:30:17.54
Miyamoto is that that's a place right?

438
00:30:17.54 --> 00:30:20.54
Or is it in this case in many cases

439
00:30:20.54 --> 00:30:23.54
It refers to originally a place

440
00:30:23.54 --> 00:30:27.54
So my understanding is that Miyamoto refers to whether it's a town or a

441
00:30:27.54 --> 00:30:31.54
Village or not province

442
00:30:31.54 --> 00:30:35.54
It would be smaller where his family originated from

443
00:30:35.54 --> 00:30:38.54
It's not always the case, but even if you look at English names

444
00:30:38.54 --> 00:30:39.54
You find the same thing

445
00:30:39.54 --> 00:30:42.54
So it could have been in English and in a lot of languages

446
00:30:42.54 --> 00:30:45.54
It often relates to an early vocation

447
00:30:45.54 --> 00:30:49.54
So far as, for instance, comes from far as

448
00:30:49.54 --> 00:30:52.54
Like FER or OUS, like Far as Oxide, Iron

449
00:30:52.54 --> 00:30:54.54
Because way back in the day

450
00:30:54.54 --> 00:30:58.54
At some point, my family worked with medals

451
00:30:58.54 --> 00:31:02.54
And that's where the name comes from

452
00:31:02.54 --> 00:31:05.54
Is Miyamoto the first name or the last name?

453
00:31:05.54 --> 00:31:07.54
Miyamoto is the last name

454
00:31:07.54 --> 00:31:11.54
So similarly the authors of this, the author of this book

455
00:31:11.54 --> 00:31:14.54
Aji Yoshikawa, the Yoshikawa is the last name

456
00:31:14.54 --> 00:31:18.54
And why do I say Miyamoto Musashi?

457
00:31:18.54 --> 00:31:23.54
The Japanese always say the last name first

458
00:31:23.54 --> 00:31:25.54
They say the family name first

459
00:31:25.54 --> 00:31:27.54
Except for in the skies case

460
00:31:27.54 --> 00:31:30.54
Eji, what they said this is

461
00:31:30.54 --> 00:31:32.54
Transitioning, got it, yeah

462
00:31:32.54 --> 00:31:34.54
That makes sense

463
00:31:34.54 --> 00:31:35.54
Making some progress

464
00:31:35.54 --> 00:31:37.54
So for instance, in J-

465
00:31:37.54 --> 00:31:39.54
Very slow progress in J-

466
00:31:39.54 --> 00:31:43.54
In the actual capability, maxing out where they are

467
00:31:43.54 --> 00:31:48.54
Yes, in Japan, for instance, even as a young kid

468
00:31:48.54 --> 00:31:54.54
When you're talking to your friends, you would never, I can't

469
00:31:54.54 --> 00:31:58.54
Recall even once saying someone's first name

470
00:31:58.54 --> 00:32:00.54
You would just say

471
00:32:00.54 --> 00:32:03.54
Oh, you know, Yamamoto, Tanaka

472
00:32:03.54 --> 00:32:05.54
So I've got you Ferris

473
00:32:05.54 --> 00:32:07.54
Yeah, you're calling me

474
00:32:07.54 --> 00:32:10.54
In my case, because Ferris was not confusing

475
00:32:10.54 --> 00:32:14.54
But they knew I was American and Tim

476
00:32:14.54 --> 00:32:16.54
Like, Timu, as they would say

477
00:32:16.54 --> 00:32:19.54
Which shorter, so they just called me, Timu

478
00:32:19.54 --> 00:32:20.54
Timu, Timu, Timu

479
00:32:20.54 --> 00:32:22.54
You get that in the military too, everyone kind of gets introduced

480
00:32:22.54 --> 00:32:25.54
By your last name and everyone for a while, everyone just kind of calls each other

481
00:32:25.54 --> 00:32:28.54
You know, willing, Ferris, J-Alps, you know

482
00:32:28.54 --> 00:32:29.54
Right

483
00:32:29.54 --> 00:32:31.54
But that's how they address each other pretty normally

484
00:32:31.54 --> 00:32:32.54
Oh yeah, all the time

485
00:32:32.54 --> 00:32:36.54
Yeah, with the exception of saying my host family where I'm dealing with

486
00:32:36.54 --> 00:32:38.54
Everybody who has the same last name, you're giving a confusing

487
00:32:38.54 --> 00:32:40.54
So then I would call him by their first name

488
00:32:40.54 --> 00:32:42.54
Jack, Jack

489
00:32:42.54 --> 00:32:44.54
All right, now

490
00:32:44.54 --> 00:32:49.54
This book does have a romantic interest in it

491
00:32:49.54 --> 00:32:51.54
I hate to inform everyone

492
00:32:51.54 --> 00:32:58.54
It's absolutely worth coming, covering because the way it gets handled throughout

493
00:32:58.54 --> 00:33:00.54
It's just freaking epic

494
00:33:00.54 --> 00:33:07.54
So his romantic interest is a woman named Otzu

495
00:33:07.54 --> 00:33:08.54
Otzu

496
00:33:08.54 --> 00:33:10.54
Yes, see?

497
00:33:10.54 --> 00:33:11.54
Otzu

498
00:33:11.54 --> 00:33:14.54
And again, we can't cover the whole story

499
00:33:14.54 --> 00:33:16.54
But this is his romantic interest

500
00:33:16.54 --> 00:33:19.54
And we will

501
00:33:19.54 --> 00:33:22.54
He's in the name of the story

502
00:33:22.54 --> 00:33:27.54
The main point is that even though he desires her and wants to be with her at the same time

503
00:33:27.54 --> 00:33:29.54
There's something that's more important to him

504
00:33:29.54 --> 00:33:32.54
And that is the way of the sword

505
00:33:32.54 --> 00:33:34.54
So here we go

506
00:33:34.54 --> 00:33:36.54
Back to the book, Musashi covered her small white hand

507
00:33:36.54 --> 00:33:39.54
Which was resting on the railing with his own

508
00:33:39.54 --> 00:33:41.54
Listen, he said plaintively

509
00:33:41.54 --> 00:33:43.54
I beg of you, just stop and think

510
00:33:43.54 --> 00:33:45.54
What's there to think about?

511
00:33:45.54 --> 00:33:48.54
I told you, I've just become a new man

512
00:33:48.54 --> 00:33:50.54
I stayed in that musty hole for three years

513
00:33:50.54 --> 00:33:52.54
I read books, I thought

514
00:33:52.54 --> 00:33:54.54
I screamed and cried

515
00:33:54.54 --> 00:33:56.54
Then suddenly the light dawned

516
00:33:56.54 --> 00:33:59.54
I understood what it means to be human

517
00:33:59.54 --> 00:34:02.54
I have a new name, Miyamoto Musashi

518
00:34:02.54 --> 00:34:05.54
I want to dedicate myself to training and discipline

519
00:34:05.54 --> 00:34:10.54
I want to spend every moment of everyday working to improve myself

520
00:34:10.54 --> 00:34:13.54
I now know how far I have to go

521
00:34:13.54 --> 00:34:16.54
If you choose to bind your life to mind

522
00:34:16.54 --> 00:34:19.54
You'll never be happy

523
00:34:19.54 --> 00:34:21.54
There will be nothing but hardship

524
00:34:21.54 --> 00:34:24.54
And it won't get any easier as it goes along

525
00:34:24.54 --> 00:34:27.54
It'll get more and more difficult

526
00:34:28.54 --> 00:34:31.54
When you talk like that, I feel closer to you than ever

527
00:34:31.54 --> 00:34:33.54
Now I'm convinced I would write

528
00:34:33.54 --> 00:34:35.54
I found the best man I could ever find

529
00:34:35.54 --> 00:34:37.54
Even if I searched for the rest of my life

530
00:34:37.54 --> 00:34:40.54
He saw he was just making things worse

531
00:34:40.54 --> 00:34:44.54
I'm sorry, I just can't take you with me

532
00:34:44.54 --> 00:34:46.54
Well then I'll just follow along

533
00:34:46.54 --> 00:34:48.54
As long as I don't interfere with your training

534
00:34:48.54 --> 00:34:50.54
What harm would it do?

535
00:34:50.54 --> 00:34:52.54
You won't even know I'm around

536
00:34:52.54 --> 00:34:54.54
Musashi could find no answer

537
00:34:54.54 --> 00:34:56.54
I won't bother you, I promise

538
00:34:56.54 --> 00:34:58.54
He remained silent

539
00:34:58.54 --> 00:35:00.54
It's all right then isn't it?

540
00:35:00.54 --> 00:35:02.54
Just wait here, I'll be back in a second

541
00:35:02.54 --> 00:35:04.54
And I'll be furious if you try and sneak away

542
00:35:04.54 --> 00:35:08.54
Oatsu ran off towards the basket weaving shop

543
00:35:08.54 --> 00:35:11.54
Musashi thought of ignoring everything and running to

544
00:35:11.54 --> 00:35:14.54
In the opposite direction

545
00:35:14.54 --> 00:35:17.54
Though the will was there, his feet couldn't move

546
00:35:17.54 --> 00:35:19.54
Oatsu looked back and called

547
00:35:19.54 --> 00:35:21.54
Remember don't try to sneak off

548
00:35:21.54 --> 00:35:23.54
She smiled showing her dimples

549
00:35:23.54 --> 00:35:25.54
And Musashi inadvertently nodded

550
00:35:25.54 --> 00:35:27.54
Satisfied by this gesture

551
00:35:27.54 --> 00:35:30.54
She disappeared into the shop

552
00:35:30.54 --> 00:35:33.54
If he was going to escape, this was the time

553
00:35:33.54 --> 00:35:35.54
His heart told him so

554
00:35:35.54 --> 00:35:39.54
But his body was still shackled by Oatsu's pretty dimples

555
00:35:39.54 --> 00:35:41.54
And pleading eyes how sweet she was

556
00:35:41.54 --> 00:35:45.54
It was certain no one in the world would save his sister

557
00:35:45.54 --> 00:35:47.54
Or save his sister loved him so much

558
00:35:47.54 --> 00:35:51.54
And it wasn't as though he disliked her

559
00:35:51.54 --> 00:35:53.54
He looked at the sky

560
00:35:53.54 --> 00:35:55.54
He looked into the water

561
00:35:55.54 --> 00:35:57.54
Desperately gripped the railing

562
00:35:57.54 --> 00:35:59.54
Troubled and confused

563
00:35:59.54 --> 00:36:03.54
Soon tiny bits of wood began floating

564
00:36:03.54 --> 00:36:05.54
From the bridge into the flowing stream

565
00:36:05.54 --> 00:36:07.54
Oatsu reappeared on the bridge

566
00:36:07.54 --> 00:36:11.54
In new straw sandals, light yellow leggings

567
00:36:11.54 --> 00:36:13.54
And a large traveling hat tied under the chin

568
00:36:13.54 --> 00:36:15.54
With a crimson ribbon

569
00:36:15.54 --> 00:36:17.54
She'd never looked more beautiful

570
00:36:17.54 --> 00:36:19.54
But Musashi was nowhere to be seen

571
00:36:19.54 --> 00:36:23.54
With a cry of shock she burst into tears

572
00:36:23.54 --> 00:36:25.54
Then her eyes fell upon the spot

573
00:36:25.54 --> 00:36:27.54
On the railing from which the chips of wooded fallen

574
00:36:27.54 --> 00:36:31.54
Their carved with a point of a dagger

575
00:36:31.54 --> 00:36:33.54
Was the clearly inscribed

576
00:36:33.54 --> 00:36:37.54
The message for give me

577
00:36:37.54 --> 00:36:39.54
Forgive me

578
00:36:39.54 --> 00:36:41.54
Forgive me

579
00:36:47.54 --> 00:36:49.54
I love how measured

580
00:36:49.54 --> 00:36:51.54
His emotions are in the prose

581
00:36:51.54 --> 00:36:53.54
He clearly did not dislike her

582
00:36:53.54 --> 00:36:55.54
That's heavy

583
00:36:55.54 --> 00:36:57.54
That's like I love you

584
00:36:57.54 --> 00:36:59.54
It's not against me

585
00:36:59.54 --> 00:37:01.54
It is

586
00:37:01.54 --> 00:37:05.54
But yeah, that is the nightmarre scenario for women

587
00:37:05.54 --> 00:37:07.54
That is a abandonment issues

588
00:37:07.54 --> 00:37:13.54
And having spent quite some time in the seal teams

589
00:37:13.54 --> 00:37:15.54
This is a real thing

590
00:37:15.54 --> 00:37:17.54
Guys, they have to choose

591
00:37:17.54 --> 00:37:19.54
Between this girl and their job

592
00:37:19.54 --> 00:37:21.54
And of course, some guys can wake at work

593
00:37:21.54 --> 00:37:23.54
And blah, blah, blah, blah

594
00:37:23.54 --> 00:37:25.54
And I did a pretty decent job of making it work

595
00:37:25.54 --> 00:37:27.54
But I'm telling you, it's hard

596
00:37:27.54 --> 00:37:29.54
There's a 90% divorce rate in the seal teams in the military tie

597
00:37:29.54 --> 00:37:31.54
So this is a real choice that guys had to make

598
00:37:31.54 --> 00:37:33.54
And it can be really hard

599
00:37:33.54 --> 00:37:35.54
And that's just a nightmare scenario

600
00:37:35.54 --> 00:37:37.54
And honestly, what's jacked up

601
00:37:37.54 --> 00:37:39.54
Is that the guys are actually trying to do the right thing

602
00:37:39.54 --> 00:37:41.54
They're actually trying

603
00:37:41.54 --> 00:37:43.54
They're looking at a girl saying, look

604
00:37:43.54 --> 00:37:45.54
You don't want to sign up for this

605
00:37:45.54 --> 00:37:47.54
Like this is not going to be fun

606
00:37:47.54 --> 00:37:49.54
And you know, of course

607
00:37:49.54 --> 00:37:51.54
People fall in love and they

608
00:37:51.54 --> 00:37:53.54
Those emotions start to take over

609
00:37:53.54 --> 00:37:55.54
Ridiculously

610
00:37:55.54 --> 00:37:57.54
And

611
00:37:57.54 --> 00:37:57.54
And you know, it's a

612
00:37:57.54 --> 00:37:59.54
And you know, it's one of those things

613
00:37:59.54 --> 00:38:01.54
But that's a nightmare scenario

614
00:38:01.54 --> 00:38:03.54
It for a girl

615
00:38:03.54 --> 00:38:05.54
Yeah

616
00:38:05.54 --> 00:38:07.54
And for a guy, I think this is the weird

617
00:38:07.54 --> 00:38:09.54
I can't speak guy girl

618
00:38:09.54 --> 00:38:11.54
I can't speak for girls

619
00:38:11.54 --> 00:38:13.54
Because I'm not one

620
00:38:13.54 --> 00:38:15.54
But for most guys, they read that

621
00:38:15.54 --> 00:38:17.54
And they kind of go, yeah

622
00:38:17.54 --> 00:38:19.54
At least I do

623
00:38:19.54 --> 00:38:21.54
I get it

624
00:38:21.54 --> 00:38:23.54
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm

625
00:38:23.54 --> 00:38:25.54
I've been drinking the

626
00:38:25.54 --> 00:38:27.54
I'm a man and say where I coo

627
00:38:27.54 --> 00:38:29.54
I'm just like, I get it

628
00:38:29.54 --> 00:38:29.54
Yeah

629
00:38:29.54 --> 00:38:31.54
I bet if we had, you know, those little

630
00:38:31.54 --> 00:38:35.54
Like meters where people can vote

631
00:38:35.54 --> 00:38:37.54
Or like this spike on the

632
00:38:37.54 --> 00:38:39.54
Presidents of the Bates where things would be like

633
00:38:39.54 --> 00:38:41.54
People really agree with this thing

634
00:38:41.54 --> 00:38:43.54
If you had that right there

635
00:38:43.54 --> 00:38:45.54
And males between the ages of

636
00:38:45.54 --> 00:38:47.54
18 and 35 were hearing that

637
00:38:47.54 --> 00:38:49.54
Yeah, yeah, walk away dude

638
00:38:49.54 --> 00:38:51.54
That's what they're thinking

639
00:38:51.54 --> 00:38:53.54
Wouldn't surprise it

640
00:38:53.54 --> 00:38:53.54
Yeah

641
00:38:53.54 --> 00:38:55.54
And I'm, uh, for the seal teams

642
00:38:55.54 --> 00:38:57.54
That's totally normal culture

643
00:38:57.54 --> 00:38:59.54
Yeah, oh yeah, bro, you got to choose the teams

644
00:38:59.54 --> 00:39:01.54
You got to choose the teams first

645
00:39:01.54 --> 00:39:03.54
You know, oh, you, you don't want to, you know,

646
00:39:03.54 --> 00:39:05.54
Don't want to put her through this

647
00:39:05.54 --> 00:39:07.54
So that's kind of messed up

648
00:39:07.54 --> 00:39:09.54
But it's the reality, sorry

649
00:39:09.54 --> 00:39:11.54
Well, especially imagine if your, your intention is to go

650
00:39:11.54 --> 00:39:15.54
Do all people to the death repeatedly

651
00:39:15.54 --> 00:39:15.54
Yeah

652
00:39:15.54 --> 00:39:17.54
I mean the, the odds are not in your favor

653
00:39:17.54 --> 00:39:19.54
Yeah, eventually someone's going to

654
00:39:19.54 --> 00:39:21.54
Be better than you

655
00:39:21.54 --> 00:39:27.54
What was that? Do you have that section mark that you were reading about how he felt about people that had gotten the upper hand on him?

656
00:39:27.54 --> 00:39:29.54
Because that was pretty epic

657
00:39:29.54 --> 00:39:31.54
Oh, I'll find it

658
00:39:31.54 --> 00:39:35.54
So, and that way people don't have to listen to a bad Japanese president

659
00:39:35.54 --> 00:39:37.54
Let's see

660
00:39:37.54 --> 00:39:39.54
All right, here we go

661
00:39:39.54 --> 00:39:41.54
Yeah

662
00:39:43.54 --> 00:39:45.54
The adversaries he hit

663
00:39:45.54 --> 00:39:47.54
I'm not going to do is go to job of reading his

664
00:39:47.54 --> 00:39:53.54
Jacko, he's been his well-practiced, plus he has the audiobook voice of Jacko, we're like

665
00:39:53.54 --> 00:39:59.54
The adversaries he had defeated, even the ones he had killed or half killed always disappeared from his mind

666
00:39:59.54 --> 00:40:01.54
Like so much froth

667
00:40:01.54 --> 00:40:05.54
But he couldn't forget anyone who got the better of him in any way or for that matter

668
00:40:05.54 --> 00:40:09.54
Anyone in whom he sensed an overpowering presence

669
00:40:09.54 --> 00:40:11.54
That was the line I underlined

670
00:40:11.54 --> 00:40:13.54
Anyone in whom he sensed an overpowering presence

671
00:40:13.54 --> 00:40:21.54
Men like that dwelt in his mind living spirits and he thought constantly of how one day he might be able to overshadow them

672
00:40:21.54 --> 00:40:25.54
Yeah, that's deep right there drive

673
00:40:25.54 --> 00:40:27.54
And that's also ego issues

674
00:40:27.54 --> 00:40:29.54
Clearly, those are people are hard to deal with

675
00:40:29.54 --> 00:40:33.54
Unless you recognize that it's your own ego that's causing these problems

676
00:40:33.54 --> 00:40:35.54
Because a lot of people are so intimidated by

677
00:40:35.54 --> 00:40:41.54
I've seen that many times where you get like a young seal that's a real badass when he's coming up

678
00:40:41.54 --> 00:40:45.54
And some of the senior seals, maybe that are also badass

679
00:40:45.54 --> 00:40:47.54
You basically get two alpha males in a room

680
00:40:47.54 --> 00:40:49.54
And it can be problematic

681
00:40:49.54 --> 00:40:53.54
Unless one of them really is the old guy realises

682
00:40:53.54 --> 00:40:55.54
Usually it's the old guy that realises, hey there's a young buck coming up

683
00:40:55.54 --> 00:40:59.54
What I should do is try to help him instead of trying to keep him down

684
00:40:59.54 --> 00:41:01.54
Because I'm jealous

685
00:41:01.54 --> 00:41:05.54
And that's when Musashi has that attitude of

686
00:41:05.54 --> 00:41:09.54
You know, he's in care about the people that he beats

687
00:41:09.54 --> 00:41:13.54
Yeah, he's like the Steve Jobs of Samurai

688
00:41:13.54 --> 00:41:15.54
Yeah

689
00:41:15.54 --> 00:41:17.54
Yeah, actually, I was thinking about this

690
00:41:17.54 --> 00:41:19.54
On your podcast

691
00:41:19.54 --> 00:41:23.54
It would be awesome if you did like

692
00:41:23.54 --> 00:41:25.54
If you did like the jobs book

693
00:41:25.54 --> 00:41:27.54
And you read parts of it and you thought about it

694
00:41:27.54 --> 00:41:29.54
I thought I think that would be cool

695
00:41:29.54 --> 00:41:35.54
Yeah, you know I've considered it because I've listened to a lot of your episodes

696
00:41:35.54 --> 00:41:40.54
Uh, as you're going through books and I have all my highlights

697
00:41:40.54 --> 00:41:47.54
Furthermore, and you saw this earlier I showed you my index that I created for your book, the field manual

698
00:41:47.54 --> 00:41:51.54
And I also have I noticed this is what I was looking at as you're reading

699
00:41:51.54 --> 00:41:56.54
My own index at the beginning of Musashi with the page numbers and things that I found interesting

700
00:41:56.54 --> 00:42:01.54
So I have everything locked and loaded and ready to go for all these books that I've read

701
00:42:01.54 --> 00:42:06.54
I think it'd be awesome especially because like for instance, you know, I do books about war primarily

702
00:42:06.54 --> 00:42:10.54
Because that's what I can relate to the most but you know, if you were reading business books

703
00:42:10.54 --> 00:42:14.54
And you were talking about you know what these people went through

704
00:42:14.54 --> 00:42:17.54
And then you could relate it to what you did and how you know, it's just I think it'd be

705
00:42:17.54 --> 00:42:19.54
I like the idea of biographies

706
00:42:19.54 --> 00:42:23.54
I'm because I recently not to digress too far but I interviewed

707
00:42:23.54 --> 00:42:27.54
Walter Isaacson who I know actually who wrote the jobs book

708
00:42:27.54 --> 00:42:31.54
And because he just finished a new book on DaVinci which is spectacular

709
00:42:31.54 --> 00:42:36.54
And yeah, I actually noticed that book because it's not selling my book whatever

710
00:42:36.54 --> 00:42:40.54
Walter, well, just a good for you Walter

711
00:42:40.54 --> 00:42:44.54
We're going to go off the rails for a second but so every year

712
00:42:44.54 --> 00:42:46.54
Or every time I have a book come out

713
00:42:46.54 --> 00:42:53.54
There's Inigarten who writes cookbooks, Barefoot, Kintessa who for whatever reason always comes out in the same week

714
00:42:53.54 --> 00:42:57.54
And then he's just like lining the wall she has her own walls in the bookstore

715
00:42:57.54 --> 00:42:59.54
So I'm like how am I going to compete against walls?

716
00:42:59.54 --> 00:43:01.54
I'm trying to get an end cap

717
00:43:01.54 --> 00:43:04.54
And then also on Amazon

718
00:43:04.54 --> 00:43:08.54
Every time I have a book come out, literally every time I took a screenshot of it

719
00:43:08.54 --> 00:43:10.54
A couple weeks ago and I said, man

720
00:43:10.54 --> 00:43:13.54
This book is so hardcore

721
00:43:13.54 --> 00:43:15.54
It's so undefeatable

722
00:43:15.54 --> 00:43:16.54
Giraffes can't dance

723
00:43:16.54 --> 00:43:18.54
It's a children's book

724
00:43:18.54 --> 00:43:19.54
Oh yeah

725
00:43:19.54 --> 00:43:20.54
And it's it's

726
00:43:20.54 --> 00:43:23.54
It is it is always just slaying

727
00:43:23.54 --> 00:43:25.54
My books on Amazon

728
00:43:25.54 --> 00:43:28.54
Fortunately not the same category for the best alchemists

729
00:43:28.54 --> 00:43:34.54
But yes, biographies and going through those to tie in pieces

730
00:43:34.54 --> 00:43:41.54
What also be fun because I could compare my mindset and state

731
00:43:41.54 --> 00:43:46.54
My development at the time that I made the highlights with my observations now

732
00:43:46.54 --> 00:43:48.54
A hundred percent and I think again

733
00:43:48.54 --> 00:43:51.54
I think that would be I think a lot of people would get a lot out of it

734
00:43:51.54 --> 00:43:53.54
Because you got something out of it

735
00:43:53.54 --> 00:43:55.54
And then you get to look back on it

736
00:43:55.54 --> 00:43:56.54
You get three perspectives

737
00:43:56.54 --> 00:43:57.54
You get the person's perspective

738
00:43:57.54 --> 00:44:00.54
You get your old perspective and you get your current perspective

739
00:44:00.54 --> 00:44:02.54
That's pretty legit

740
00:44:02.54 --> 00:44:04.54
That's a lot of growth and knowledge coming from

741
00:44:04.54 --> 00:44:06.54
Pretty quick statement

742
00:44:06.54 --> 00:44:08.54
So I just want to read one more and give it

743
00:44:08.54 --> 00:44:11.54
Since it's right across from what I just read

744
00:44:11.54 --> 00:44:14.54
Anyone in whom he's sentenced overpowering presence

745
00:44:14.54 --> 00:44:17.54
And I don't have the full context here because I'm just looking at

746
00:44:17.54 --> 00:44:19.54
Independent highlights but

747
00:44:19.54 --> 00:44:24.54
It appears that massage has been approached by several men

748
00:44:24.54 --> 00:44:28.54
In some environment and there are asking him a questions

749
00:44:28.54 --> 00:44:30.54
Small talk

750
00:44:30.54 --> 00:44:33.54
Massashi wondered why they were taking up their time

751
00:44:33.54 --> 00:44:35.54
And his with their small talk

752
00:44:35.54 --> 00:44:38.54
It became apparent that he would not find out unless he asked

753
00:44:38.54 --> 00:44:41.54
So the next time there was a break in the conversation he said

754
00:44:41.54 --> 00:44:45.54
Presumably you came because you have some business with me

755
00:44:45.54 --> 00:44:48.54
I love these lines

756
00:44:48.54 --> 00:44:51.54
The dialogue is so awesome

757
00:44:51.54 --> 00:44:52.54
Yeah

758
00:44:52.54 --> 00:44:54.54
They faint surprise at the very idea

759
00:44:54.54 --> 00:44:57.54
But soon admitted that they had come on what they regarded

760
00:44:57.54 --> 00:45:00.54
As a very important mission and it goes on and on

761
00:45:00.54 --> 00:45:03.54
Yeah, it's so many good lines in there

762
00:45:03.54 --> 00:45:04.54
So many good lines

763
00:45:04.54 --> 00:45:07.54
Here's a good part moving along in the story here

764
00:45:07.54 --> 00:45:09.54
He has throughout this thing

765
00:45:09.54 --> 00:45:10.54
It's

766
00:45:10.54 --> 00:45:13.54
When I was a kid and you remember you'd watch

767
00:45:13.54 --> 00:45:15.54
What was the Saturday morning or

768
00:45:15.54 --> 00:45:17.54
One day they'd have Kung Fu Theatre

769
00:45:17.54 --> 00:45:19.54
I think it was actually called Kung Fu Theatre

770
00:45:19.54 --> 00:45:23.54
And on Kung Fu Theatre it was always these you know my school against your school

771
00:45:23.54 --> 00:45:26.54
And you know you know that that seems neat

772
00:45:26.54 --> 00:45:28.54
But that's real like that stuff really happened

773
00:45:28.54 --> 00:45:33.54
And he had these feuds with various schools of martial arts

774
00:45:33.54 --> 00:45:35.54
Like you'd seen Kung Fu Theatre

775
00:45:35.54 --> 00:45:38.54
And in this particular one

776
00:45:38.54 --> 00:45:42.54
He had gone and kind of walked up on this one school

777
00:45:42.54 --> 00:45:45.54
And then but like the leader wasn't there

778
00:45:45.54 --> 00:45:48.54
And so he writes a letter

779
00:45:48.54 --> 00:45:52.54
And here's the letter that Musashi writes which is to

780
00:45:52.54 --> 00:45:55.54
Yoshiyoka

781
00:45:55.54 --> 00:45:56.54
Yoshiyoka

782
00:45:56.54 --> 00:45:57.54
Beautiful

783
00:45:57.54 --> 00:45:59.54
The same Yoshiyoka

784
00:45:59.54 --> 00:46:00.54
That is a Yoshiyoka

785
00:46:00.54 --> 00:46:01.54
It's a character

786
00:46:01.54 --> 00:46:03.54
What does Yoshimin

787
00:46:03.54 --> 00:46:04.54
Yoshiyoka

788
00:46:04.54 --> 00:46:05.54
That's a look at it

789
00:46:05.54 --> 00:46:08.54
Same I don't recall of him

790
00:46:08.54 --> 00:46:11.54
Yoshiyoshi this Yoshiyoshi that Yoshiyoya

791
00:46:11.54 --> 00:46:13.54
All that same Yoshiyoka

792
00:46:13.54 --> 00:46:14.54
And this Yoshiyoka

793
00:46:14.54 --> 00:46:16.54
So here's what Musashi writes the letter he says

794
00:46:16.54 --> 00:46:19.54
I am told that you and your disciples are searching for me

795
00:46:19.54 --> 00:46:22.54
As it happens I am on the

796
00:46:22.54 --> 00:46:25.54
I am now on the Yamoto High Road

797
00:46:25.54 --> 00:46:28.54
My intention being to travel around in general area of Egan, ESA

798
00:46:28.54 --> 00:46:31.54
For about a year to continue my study of swordsmanship

799
00:46:31.54 --> 00:46:34.54
I did not wish to change my plans at this time

800
00:46:34.54 --> 00:46:36.54
But since I regret as much as you do that

801
00:46:36.54 --> 00:46:39.54
I was unable to meet you during my previous visit to your school

802
00:46:39.54 --> 00:46:42.54
I should like to inform you that I shall certainly be back in the capital

803
00:46:42.54 --> 00:46:45.54
By the first or second months of next year

804
00:46:45.54 --> 00:46:49.54
Between now and then I expect to improve my technique considerably

805
00:46:49.54 --> 00:46:54.54
I trust that you yourself will not neglect your practice

806
00:46:54.54 --> 00:46:56.54
It would be a great shame

807
00:46:56.54 --> 00:46:58.54
If Yoshiyoka

808
00:46:58.54 --> 00:46:59.54
Campos

809
00:46:59.54 --> 00:47:00.54
Flourishing school

810
00:47:00.54 --> 00:47:05.54
Were to suffer a second defeat like the one that sustained last time I was there

811
00:47:05.54 --> 00:47:10.54
In closing I send my respectful wishes for your continued health

812
00:47:10.54 --> 00:47:12.54
You're welcome Musashi

813
00:47:12.54 --> 00:47:14.54
So I love the little jabs

814
00:47:14.54 --> 00:47:17.54
Your flourishing school wing

815
00:47:17.54 --> 00:47:21.54
It's so jacked up

816
00:47:21.54 --> 00:47:24.54
But yeah, that's old school talking smack

817
00:47:24.54 --> 00:47:26.54
Respect that's kind of what they do in the British parliament

818
00:47:26.54 --> 00:47:29.54
Oh Hamilton if you see the play the same thing

819
00:47:29.54 --> 00:47:30.54
I haven't seen it

820
00:47:30.54 --> 00:47:33.54
It's like with kind of regards after you basically say I want to meet you and do the old shooting

821
00:47:33.54 --> 00:47:37.54
The face with kind of regards and wishes for your continued health

822
00:47:37.54 --> 00:47:40.54
You know we've lost that there's something to that isn't there

823
00:47:40.54 --> 00:47:44.54
You know like can't you just have a feud and still be respectful to someone

824
00:47:44.54 --> 00:47:47.54
Yeah, I respect your intellect and your capacities

825
00:47:47.54 --> 00:47:50.54
And yet I will stop it nothing but until I destroy you

826
00:47:50.54 --> 00:47:55.54
So this is another dojo storm

827
00:47:55.54 --> 00:47:59.54
Which again this is a modern term that I think you jitsu people created

828
00:47:59.54 --> 00:48:02.54
I don't know did you ever use the term you never heard that before

829
00:48:02.54 --> 00:48:04.54
You've never heard dojo storm before

830
00:48:04.54 --> 00:48:10.54
Oh dojo storm is when you take your jitsu guys and you go to another and this happened

831
00:48:10.54 --> 00:48:18.54
Again in San Diego San Diego where we live is is it's gone through the phase already of all the schools being all

832
00:48:18.54 --> 00:48:20.54
All

833
00:48:20.54 --> 00:48:25.54
Battling against each other and really the battle there's multiple reasons

834
00:48:25.54 --> 00:48:29.54
One of them is because back in the day before YouTube

835
00:48:29.54 --> 00:48:33.54
You could actually have moves that you could keep contained in your school and you could say hey look

836
00:48:33.54 --> 00:48:39.54
Don't show anyone this because we're gonna use this in the next tournament and we want to which is exactly what happened in Japan too

837
00:48:39.54 --> 00:48:42.54
By the way, so with these schools with these schools

838
00:48:42.54 --> 00:48:47.54
So you'd have secret moves will now honestly with YouTube and every competition is on YouTube

839
00:48:47.54 --> 00:48:50.54
And you can watch anybody from any school and you can see what moves they're doing

840
00:48:50.54 --> 00:48:54.54
And there's all this online so so basically there's no more secret school

841
00:48:54.54 --> 00:48:58.54
You can knowledge anymore the other thing is economically

842
00:48:58.54 --> 00:49:00.54
At one time it was

843
00:49:00.54 --> 00:49:06.54
Don't leave my school because you're my student you're giving me 150 bucks a month and so don't go to another school

844
00:49:06.54 --> 00:49:10.54
And what that did initially it worked you could keep your students

845
00:49:10.54 --> 00:49:15.54
But people realize that if you want to get good you have to get out and train with other people sometimes

846
00:49:15.54 --> 00:49:18.54
And so if you weren't gonna let me go and train it other schools sometimes

847
00:49:18.54 --> 00:49:20.54
I'm not gonna train at your school

848
00:49:20.54 --> 00:49:23.54
And so they would actually end up losing students by trying to keep the students

849
00:49:23.54 --> 00:49:25.54
So I think that's what kind of level San Diego out

850
00:49:25.54 --> 00:49:28.54
And other areas that are high concentration jiu-jitsu

851
00:49:28.54 --> 00:49:33.54
Because yeah, it's because now it's you know people will come and go and train it different schools

852
00:49:33.54 --> 00:49:36.54
And everyone's cool. It's it's just a much more mellow atmosphere

853
00:49:36.54 --> 00:49:41.54
I was a member in 2000 when I first moved to the Bay Area and it was training in jiu-jitsu

854
00:49:41.54 --> 00:49:45.54
And I walked into the school to take my first class and they had

855
00:49:45.54 --> 00:49:48.54
It wasn't very well written from a legal standpoint

856
00:49:48.54 --> 00:49:52.54
But they had an NDA a non-disclosure agreement that they had people sign

857
00:49:52.54 --> 00:49:57.54
So they would not teach the inner working and techniques of said school

858
00:49:57.54 --> 00:50:00.54
Yeah, exactly. It used to be a lot tighter

859
00:50:00.54 --> 00:50:03.54
And I think you two pretty much is the thing that destroyed that

860
00:50:03.54 --> 00:50:07.54
Yeah, but but back in the day the dojo storms would take place

861
00:50:07.54 --> 00:50:11.54
Which was we would go from one school and go to another school

862
00:50:11.54 --> 00:50:15.54
That was let's say a school was saying oh we'll beat these guys

863
00:50:15.54 --> 00:50:17.54
Or we have better jiu-jitsu. Oh really got better jiu-jitsu cool

864
00:50:17.54 --> 00:50:20.54
Hello, how you doing? We're here to see who jiu-jitsu is better

865
00:50:20.54 --> 00:50:25.54
And it's the dojo storm and show up and and you know everything is determined on the map

866
00:50:25.54 --> 00:50:27.54
That's a beautiful thing about jiu-jitsu

867
00:50:27.54 --> 00:50:33.54
So this is old school dojo storming and this is against

868
00:50:33.54 --> 00:50:35.54
Hose Wayne

869
00:50:35.54 --> 00:50:37.54
Hose Wayne, I'd have to see how's this built?

870
00:50:37.54 --> 00:50:41.54
H-O-Z-O-I-N. Yeah, Hose Wayne. That's right

871
00:50:41.54 --> 00:50:45.54
Here we go for dojo storm

872
00:50:45.54 --> 00:50:50.54
And he's he's showing up there kind of looking for where the

873
00:50:50.54 --> 00:50:54.54
School is he's kind of like a little bit lost looking around for where the actual school is

874
00:50:54.54 --> 00:50:58.54
And there's a priest that he's working with when he reappeared the priest handed him a

875
00:50:58.54 --> 00:51:03.54
Registry and ink box saying write down your name and where you studied and what style you use

876
00:51:03.54 --> 00:51:06.54
He spoke as though instructing a child

877
00:51:06.54 --> 00:51:12.54
The title on the registry was list of persons visiting this temple to study

878
00:51:12.54 --> 00:51:15.54
Stured of the Holy Soin

879
00:51:15.54 --> 00:51:19.54
Hose Wayne opened the book and glanced over the names each listed under the date on which the

880
00:51:19.54 --> 00:51:21.54
Sam Rire student had called

881
00:51:21.54 --> 00:51:25.54
Following the style of the last entry he wrote down the required information

882
00:51:25.54 --> 00:51:27.54
Omitting the name of his teacher

883
00:51:27.54 --> 00:51:30.54
The priest of course was especially interested in that

884
00:51:30.54 --> 00:51:35.54
Hose Wayne's answer was essentially the one he'd given at the Yoshikos school

885
00:51:35.54 --> 00:51:38.54
He had practiced the use of the Truncheon under his father

886
00:51:38.54 --> 00:51:40.54
Without working very hard at it

887
00:51:40.54 --> 00:51:45.54
Since making up in his mind to study in earnest he had taken as his teacher everything in the

888
00:51:45.54 --> 00:51:50.54
Universe as well as the example set by his predecessors throughout the country

889
00:51:50.54 --> 00:51:54.54
He ended up by saying I'm still in the process of learning

890
00:51:54.54 --> 00:51:57.54
Hmm you probably know this already

891
00:51:57.54 --> 00:52:02.54
But since the time of our first master the Hose Wayne has been celebrated everywhere for its

892
00:52:02.54 --> 00:52:06.54
Lands techniques the fighting that goes on here is a rough and there are no exceptions

893
00:52:06.54 --> 00:52:12.54
Before you go on perhaps you better read what's written at the beginning of the registry

894
00:52:12.54 --> 00:52:18.54
Hose Wayne picked up the book opened it and read the stipulation which he had skipped over before

895
00:52:18.54 --> 00:52:26.54
It said having come here for the purpose of study I absolve the temple of all responsibility in the event that I suffer

896
00:52:26.54 --> 00:52:28.54
Bottily injury or I'm killed

897
00:52:28.54 --> 00:52:31.54
I agreed to that said Hose Wayne with a slight grin

898
00:52:31.54 --> 00:52:38.54
It amounted to no more than the common sense for anyone committed to becoming a warrior all right this way

899
00:52:38.54 --> 00:52:41.54
So that's the introduction and that's actually cool too

900
00:52:41.54 --> 00:52:45.54
That's an old school jiu-jitsu thing when you come in for the other thing that would happen is challenge matches

901
00:52:45.54 --> 00:52:48.54
And I don't know if you've seen videos from the old school gracey academy of the challenge matches

902
00:52:48.54 --> 00:52:52.54
Yeah, but those guys would come in and sign a waiver like hey if you die

903
00:52:52.54 --> 00:52:55.54
We're not we're not liable. This is the the old

904
00:52:55.54 --> 00:53:03.54
The old the like gray market black market copy over copy VHS of Grayson action. Yeah, yeah, yeah

905
00:53:03.54 --> 00:53:13.54
Yeah, we had my my old teacher Fabio Santos and he had videos of himself doing Gracie challenge matches at the Gracie school up in torrents

906
00:53:13.54 --> 00:53:19.54
And he would play him for us and it's the same thing yep sign your waiver and then you're going to get your own broken by the way first

907
00:53:19.54 --> 00:53:27.54
I break your leg the end up with you like why so in this point he goes into the school and there's some

908
00:53:27.54 --> 00:53:34.54
Badass he's not the head of the school, but he's like their best guy and he's up there kicking everyone's ass

909
00:53:34.54 --> 00:53:42.54
He's saying next and he's roughs a guy up and kicks his ass then next roughs that guy up next and finally no one else wants to fight

910
00:53:42.54 --> 00:53:48.54
And here we go this guy's name is ag agon a g o n agon

911
00:53:48.54 --> 00:53:55.54
Yeah, it's agon and unusual he's the guy that's been rough and everyone up is there is there no one else build agon?

912
00:53:55.54 --> 00:53:58.54
Now holding his practice Lance horizontally

913
00:53:58.54 --> 00:54:04.54
The brawny steward was comparing his registry with the faces of the waiting men he pointed at one

914
00:54:04.54 --> 00:54:08.54
No, not today. I'll come again some other time. How about you?

915
00:54:08.54 --> 00:54:15.54
No, I don't feel quite up to it today one by one they backed out until Musashi saw the finger pointing at him

916
00:54:15.54 --> 00:54:21.54
How about you if you please if you please what's that supposed to mean?

917
00:54:21.54 --> 00:54:23.54
It means I'd like to fight

918
00:54:29.54 --> 00:54:39.54
Yeah, and so he he's gonna go and and I'm gonna pull a couple highlights out of this thing, but but the this guy if you please so this guy agon he

919
00:54:39.54 --> 00:54:47.54
Immediately does like a practice run at some board that he puts his Lance right through and it's sort of like an intimidation

920
00:54:47.54 --> 00:54:50.54
Tagged it right. Oh, you want to train cool watch this

921
00:54:50.54 --> 00:54:56.54
He screams and he puts his Lance right through this this right through this thing and

922
00:54:57.54 --> 00:55:04.54
Actually there's a there's a the old the guy that had brought him into that a broad in Musashi's looking at him and saying hey

923
00:55:04.54 --> 00:55:15.54
Um, don't be a fool you look stupid. That's not a board you're about to take on meaning like you just killed the board the piece of wood, but that's this guy is not just a board

924
00:55:15.54 --> 00:55:25.54
Um, but it still didn't hit back. Yeah, and and paper targets don't shoot back and they don't move that's something I've said many many times

925
00:55:25.54 --> 00:55:34.54
Um Musashi then says after he does this you know like this crazy scream and puts his Lance through the wood

926
00:55:34.54 --> 00:55:36.54
He says are you ready now

927
00:55:40.54 --> 00:55:47.54
Back to the book this solicitor drove agon wild his muscles were like steel when he jumped he did so with awesome lightness

928
00:55:47.54 --> 00:55:52.54
His feet seemed to be on the floor and in the air at the same time quivering like the moonlight on ocean waves

929
00:55:52.54 --> 00:55:57.54
Musashi stood perfectly still or so it seemed there was nothing unusual about his stance

930
00:55:57.54 --> 00:56:04.54
He held his sword straight out with both hands, but being slightly smaller than his opponent and not so conspicuously muscular

931
00:56:04.54 --> 00:56:08.54
He looked almost casual the greatest difference was in their eyes

932
00:56:08.54 --> 00:56:13.54
Musashi's were sharp as a bird their pupils a clear coral tinted with blood

933
00:56:13.54 --> 00:56:22.54
Agon shook his head perhaps to shake off the streams and sweat pouring down from his forehead perhaps to shake off the old man's warning words had they lingered on

934
00:56:22.54 --> 00:56:27.54
Was he attempting to cast him out of his mind whatever the reason he was extremely agitated

935
00:56:27.54 --> 00:56:33.54
He repeatedly shifted his position trying to draw out Musashi, but Musashi remained motionless

936
00:56:33.54 --> 00:56:41.54
Agon's lunch was accompanied by a piercing scream in the split second that decided the encounter Musashi paried in counterattack

937
00:56:41.54 --> 00:56:44.54
What happened?

938
00:56:44.54 --> 00:56:50.54
Agon's fellow priest hastily ran over and crowded around him in a black circle in the general confusion

939
00:56:50.54 --> 00:56:58.54
Some trip over his practice lands and went sprawling a priest stood up his hands and chest smeared with blood shouting medicine

940
00:56:58.54 --> 00:57:00.54
Bring the medicine quick

941
00:57:00.54 --> 00:57:02.54
You won't need any medicine

942
00:57:02.54 --> 00:57:08.54
It was the old man who had come in the front entrance and quickly assess the situation

943
00:57:08.54 --> 00:57:14.54
His face turned sour if I thought medicine would save him I wouldn't have tried to stop him in the first place

944
00:57:17.54 --> 00:57:23.54
So that's it Musashi one shot one kill takes the dude out and

945
00:57:23.54 --> 00:57:29.54
Interestingly, here's the advice so that guy that had taken him in is the actual master and

946
00:57:29.54 --> 00:57:33.54
He says is your name me, Matthew, Musashi

947
00:57:33.54 --> 00:57:38.54
That's correct under whom did you study the martial arts? I've had no teacher in the ordinary sense

948
00:57:38.54 --> 00:57:43.54
My father taught me how to use the trungeon when I was young since then I picked up a number of points from the older

949
00:57:43.54 --> 00:57:50.54
Samurai and various provinces. I've also spent some time traveling about the countryside learning from the mountains and the rivers

950
00:57:50.54 --> 00:57:53.54
I regard them to as teachers

951
00:57:53.54 --> 00:57:57.54
You seem to have the right attitude, but you're so strong much too strong

952
00:57:57.54 --> 00:58:03.54
Believing he was being praised Musashi blust and said, oh no, I'm still immature

953
00:58:03.54 --> 00:58:11.54
I'm always making blunders. That is not what I mean. You're strength as your problem. You must learn to control it become weaker

954
00:58:11.54 --> 00:58:22.54
What's also fun to do and I'm thinking about doing this when I reread this book in full again is to spend some time on YouTube watching

955
00:58:22.54 --> 00:58:36.54
High-level condo competition to see how fast it is. Just a good idea of how much can transpire in the blink of an eye

956
00:58:36.54 --> 00:58:41.54
Is there a referee that calls it as a kill shot? How does it get scored in the first?

957
00:58:41.54 --> 00:58:49.54
There are referees, so I had a chance to train in Kendall when I went back to Japan about eight years ago

958
00:58:49.54 --> 00:58:54.54
Some of that eight or ten years ago, and I trained at this place called Q-Makeung

959
00:58:54.54 --> 00:59:01.54
And I still have the armor still have everything and you have to

960
00:59:01.54 --> 00:59:07.54
Much like calling your shots in pool, you have to call your target a split second before you hit it or as you hit it

961
00:59:07.54 --> 00:59:10.54
So you can see like men is head

962
00:59:10.54 --> 00:59:19.54
Dull is abdomen, cult is the gauntlet or the arm and then skit is jabbed to the throat which is pretty nasty

963
00:59:19.54 --> 00:59:26.54
And you line up in such a way the sword is the tip of the sword is basically pointing at your points throughout as you track them

964
00:59:26.54 --> 00:59:35.54
And you can see there are referees in cases of any type of their definitely referees in cases of any dispute. They're very rarely disputes

965
00:59:35.54 --> 00:59:45.54
But it's so subtle and the the misses are so close, much like really maybe hot really really high level boxing

966
00:59:45.54 --> 00:59:49.54
I mean when someone parries it's not like it's traveling a foot to the side of their head

967
00:59:49.54 --> 00:59:53.54
It's just grazing the side of their head and then they counter punch

968
00:59:53.54 --> 00:59:55.54
Then you see it in Kendall the movement's just faster

969
00:59:55.54 --> 00:59:59.54
So it's really wild to see you get your bell wrong when you get hit

970
00:59:59.54 --> 01:00:06.54
I expected because I saw the armor and the armor seems pretty hard that you don't you absolutely get your bell wrong

971
01:00:06.54 --> 01:00:09.54
Especially remember my first class and

972
01:00:09.54 --> 01:00:14.54
I you know I'm bigger than a lot of Japanese guys not all. I mean they're certainly some big Japanese guys

973
01:00:14.54 --> 01:00:18.54
And I was more heavily muscled and they're like, oh okay

974
01:00:18.54 --> 01:00:25.54
And there's and most of the Japanese this has been my experience in Japanese schools whether it's judo jiu jitsu

975
01:00:25.54 --> 01:00:33.54
I don't know otherwise spend some time way back in the day with the pancreas guys and so on before and it may really came to the US

976
01:00:33.54 --> 01:00:37.54
Is generally speaking everyone's pretty cool

977
01:00:37.54 --> 01:00:41.54
I guess supposed to sustain the US too then they're just one or two guys were like, oh

978
01:00:41.54 --> 01:00:45.54
Forner in my school. Okay. I want to run your bell

979
01:00:45.54 --> 01:00:50.54
And there was one guy there who wanted to want it to fight and I was like, okay

980
01:00:50.54 --> 01:00:56.54
Because I figured like my reflexes are pretty good, but the reflexes of head movement in kendo

981
01:00:56.54 --> 01:00:59.54
Bad idea you always want to have the sword in between

982
01:00:59.54 --> 01:01:04.54
You and your opponent and to protect the center line

983
01:01:04.54 --> 01:01:07.54
So if you start moving your head or your shoulders

984
01:01:07.54 --> 01:01:12.54
In such a way that you might say of a vape punch you really expose yourself

985
01:01:12.54 --> 01:01:15.54
So I ended up getting whacked not just on the top of the head

986
01:01:15.54 --> 01:01:19.54
But behind the armor because your back is open and the back of your head is open

987
01:01:19.54 --> 01:01:23.54
And so I ended up getting whacked like on the upper traps and neck with these she and I

988
01:01:23.54 --> 01:01:28.54
These bamboo swords which hurt those those absolutely will ring your bell

989
01:01:28.54 --> 01:01:31.54
So yeah, you feel it you're familiar with the dog brothers right?

990
01:01:31.54 --> 01:01:35.54
I am yeah those they bring it they really bring it

991
01:01:35.54 --> 01:01:38.54
Yeah, they're awesome. I have nothing but respect for the dog

992
01:01:38.54 --> 01:01:40.54
If you don't know what they are eating check them out on YouTube

993
01:01:40.54 --> 01:01:47.54
But they do full contact simulated knife and stick and I think it started with stick fighting

994
01:01:47.54 --> 01:01:51.54
Started with stick yes, start with the screamer and my understanding is they have the gathering

995
01:01:51.54 --> 01:01:56.54
I was watching these videos at the same time was watching the crazy in action videos

996
01:01:56.54 --> 01:02:00.54
Yeah, and I remember like oh people were just learning what a triangle choke was

997
01:02:00.54 --> 01:02:03.54
I was like oh I could choke people my legs. I was a new thing

998
01:02:03.54 --> 01:02:09.54
Yeah, and I remember seeing this video of I think it was the gathering where you have salty dog and so on

999
01:02:09.54 --> 01:02:14.54
And the participants who come just have to mutually agree on which weapons are acceptable

1000
01:02:14.54 --> 01:02:17.54
So you'd have like one guy with a garden hose and then another guy with like

1001
01:02:17.54 --> 01:02:22.54
I kind of sword with like the tip cut off that's played open

1002
01:02:22.54 --> 01:02:25.54
And then they would go at it and I remember at this one point

1003
01:02:25.54 --> 01:02:30.54
I saw this guy pull a guard you know the people are just going nuts some people have a cross helmet on

1004
01:02:30.54 --> 01:02:35.54
I mean it's like just bonkers madmax and these two guys are going to add it and

1005
01:02:35.54 --> 01:02:41.54
Once clearly a wrestler takes the guy down and gets caught in a triangle

1006
01:02:41.54 --> 01:02:48.54
Oh my god, I guess that's it. And then he's like no, that's not it. The guy took his his a screamer stick and took the end of it and just shoved it right in between

1007
01:02:48.54 --> 01:02:50.54
Guys, that's cheap

1008
01:02:50.54 --> 01:02:52.54
Great way to break the triangle turns out

1009
01:02:52.54 --> 01:02:57.54
And then just then just proceed it to beat the living shit out of him with a stick on the ground

1010
01:02:57.54 --> 01:02:58.54
That's not fun

1011
01:02:58.54 --> 01:03:01.54
I don't like that triangle defense

1012
01:03:01.54 --> 01:03:06.54
I don't like that at all

1013
01:03:06.54 --> 01:03:09.54
I think we're getting into another

1014
01:03:09.54 --> 01:03:11.54
Just just good

1015
01:03:11.54 --> 01:03:15.54
He's about to meet up with these more more of these

1016
01:03:15.54 --> 01:03:17.54
Huzzoyne

1017
01:03:17.54 --> 01:03:19.54
Guys for some battle

1018
01:03:19.54 --> 01:03:22.54
All the priest carried lances black sleeves talked up

1019
01:03:22.54 --> 01:03:28.54
They were ready for action apparently set up on avenging the death of a gun and restoring the temples on her

1020
01:03:28.54 --> 01:03:31.54
They looked grotesque like so many demons from hell

1021
01:03:31.54 --> 01:03:38.54
The Ronin formed a semicircle so they could watch the show and at the same time keep Musashi from escaping

1022
01:03:38.54 --> 01:03:42.54
The this precaution however proved unnecessary

1023
01:03:42.54 --> 01:03:47.54
From Musashi showed no signs of either running or backing down

1024
01:03:47.54 --> 01:03:53.54
In fact he was walking steadily and directly toward them slowly paced by pace

1025
01:03:53.54 --> 01:03:56.54
He advanced looking as if he might pounce at any moment

1026
01:03:56.54 --> 01:04:02.54
For a moment there was an ominous silence as both sides contemplated approaching death

1027
01:04:02.54 --> 01:04:07.54
Musashi's face faced when deadly white and through his eyes

1028
01:04:07.54 --> 01:04:12.54
Stare the eyes of the god of vengeance glittering with venom

1029
01:04:12.54 --> 01:04:16.54
He was selecting his prey

1030
01:04:16.54 --> 01:04:21.54
Neither the Ronin nor the priest were his tents as Musashi their numbers gave them confidence

1031
01:04:21.54 --> 01:04:27.54
And their optimism was unshakable still no one wanted to be attacked wanted to be the first attacked

1032
01:04:27.54 --> 01:04:32.54
A priest at the end of the column of the Lancers gave a signal and without breaking formation

1033
01:04:32.54 --> 01:04:34.54
They rushed around to Musashi's right

1034
01:04:34.54 --> 01:04:38.54
Musashi, I am in shun shouted the same priest

1035
01:04:38.54 --> 01:04:42.54
I'm told you came while I was away away and killed a gun

1036
01:04:42.54 --> 01:04:46.54
That you later publicly insulted the honor of the Huzzoyne

1037
01:04:46.54 --> 01:04:51.54
That you mocked us by having posters put up all over town is this true?

1038
01:04:51.54 --> 01:04:56.54
No shouted Musashi, if you're a priest you should know better than to trust only what you see in here

1039
01:04:56.54 --> 01:04:59.54
You should consider things with your mind and spirit

1040
01:04:59.54 --> 01:05:02.54
It was like pouring oil on the flames

1041
01:05:02.54 --> 01:05:07.54
Ignoring their leader the priest began to shout saying talk was cheap it was time to fight

1042
01:05:07.54 --> 01:05:12.54
They were enthusiastically seconded by the Ronin who had grouped themselves

1043
01:05:12.54 --> 01:05:17.54
In close formation, Musashi's left screaming cursing and waving their swords in the air

1044
01:05:17.54 --> 01:05:19.54
They egged the priests on into action

1045
01:05:19.54 --> 01:05:22.54
Musashi convinced that the Ronin were all mouth and no fight

1046
01:05:22.54 --> 01:05:27.54
Suddenly turned to them and shouted all right which one of you wants to come forward

1047
01:05:27.54 --> 01:05:29.54
All but two or three fell back a plate pace

1048
01:05:29.54 --> 01:05:32.54
Each sure that Musashi's evil eye was upon him

1049
01:05:32.54 --> 01:05:36.54
Two or the two or three brave ones stood ready swords out stretched

1050
01:05:36.54 --> 01:05:38.54
In issuing at the challenge

1051
01:05:38.54 --> 01:05:40.54
In the wink of an eye

1052
01:05:40.54 --> 01:05:44.54
Musashi was on one of them like a fighting cock

1053
01:05:44.54 --> 01:05:48.54
There was a sound of a popping cork and the ground turned red

1054
01:05:48.54 --> 01:05:50.54
Then came a chilling noise

1055
01:05:50.54 --> 01:05:52.54
Not a battle cry, not a curse

1056
01:05:52.54 --> 01:05:55.54
But a truly bud blood curdling howl

1057
01:05:55.54 --> 01:05:59.54
Musashi's sword screeched back and forth through the air

1058
01:05:59.54 --> 01:06:01.54
A reverberation in its own body

1059
01:06:01.54 --> 01:06:04.54
In his own body telling him when he connected with human bone

1060
01:06:04.54 --> 01:06:07.54
Blood and brain spattered from his blade

1061
01:06:07.54 --> 01:06:09.54
Fingers and arms flew through the air

1062
01:06:09.54 --> 01:06:14.54
Most of the time Musashi wasn't really conscious of what he was doing

1063
01:06:14.54 --> 01:06:21.54
He was in a sort of trans, a murderous dream in which body and soul were concentrated in this free-foot sword

1064
01:06:21.54 --> 01:06:25.54
Unconsciously his whole life experience

1065
01:06:25.54 --> 01:06:28.54
The knowledge his father had beaten into him

1066
01:06:28.54 --> 01:06:30.54
What he had learned at the Sega Jara

1067
01:06:30.54 --> 01:06:34.54
The theories he had heard at the various schools of swordsmanship

1068
01:06:34.54 --> 01:06:36.54
The lessons taught to him by the mountains and trees

1069
01:06:36.54 --> 01:06:39.54
Everything came into play in the rapid movements of his body

1070
01:06:39.54 --> 01:06:42.54
He became a disembodied whirlwind

1071
01:06:42.54 --> 01:06:46.54
Mowing down the herd of roen and who by their stunned bewilderment

1072
01:06:46.54 --> 01:06:50.54
Left themselves wide open to his sword

1073
01:06:50.54 --> 01:06:54.54
I'm trying to think of why these particular passages

1074
01:06:54.54 --> 01:06:56.54
But one of the things you know this disembodiment

1075
01:06:56.54 --> 01:07:00.54
Which I talk about all the time being able to be detached from what's happening

1076
01:07:00.54 --> 01:07:07.54
is so important as a person as a leader and as a you know in more slots you have to do it too

1077
01:07:07.54 --> 01:07:11.54
If you're getting so wrapped up around the thought of what's happening

1078
01:07:11.54 --> 01:07:14.54
You you won't make good decisions, but this actually goes beyond it

1079
01:07:14.54 --> 01:07:16.54
This this is like getting in the zone

1080
01:07:16.54 --> 01:07:18.54
This is you know when you're not thinking anymore

1081
01:07:18.54 --> 01:07:21.54
And always saying jiu-jitsu if you're thinking about your next move

1082
01:07:21.54 --> 01:07:23.54
It's too late the other person's already doing something to you

1083
01:07:23.54 --> 01:07:27.54
But that idea of being disembodied and being detached

1084
01:07:27.54 --> 01:07:32.54
And not thinking about what you're doing but just doing it is epic if you can do it

1085
01:07:32.54 --> 01:07:35.54
And we were chatting a little bit

1086
01:07:35.54 --> 01:07:39.54
Echo you know I before we started recording about Marcello Garcia

1087
01:07:39.54 --> 01:07:44.54
In New York and I've spent some time with Marcello and rolled with Marcello

1088
01:07:44.54 --> 01:07:47.54
And I'm not by any stretch

1089
01:07:47.54 --> 01:07:51.54
I would say good at jiu-jitsu but none of the last had a chance to spend some time in the mouth

1090
01:07:51.54 --> 01:07:53.54
With him and handful of other guys

1091
01:07:53.54 --> 01:07:57.54
Sweetest guy you can ever imagine people who don't know the name

1092
01:07:57.54 --> 01:08:01.54
Suppose it's fair to say the Michael Jordan Mike Tyson

1093
01:08:01.54 --> 01:08:05.54
Wayne Gretzky of jiu-jitsu wrapped into one he's he's just

1094
01:08:05.54 --> 01:08:10.54
Kind of like the kimera after which the kamura is named

1095
01:08:10.54 --> 01:08:13.54
So who was a very famous jiu-jitsu

1096
01:08:13.54 --> 01:08:15.54
Fought Helio Gracie

1097
01:08:15.54 --> 01:08:21.54
People in Japan used to say before kimera no kimera after kimera no kimera

1098
01:08:21.54 --> 01:08:23.54
Like a nongering phenomenon

1099
01:08:23.54 --> 01:08:28.54
And Marcello is I mean

1100
01:08:28.54 --> 01:08:33.54
Gotta be close to that I mean he's he's really good and one of the things that you observe with Marcello

1101
01:08:33.54 --> 01:08:37.54
And Josh Waitzkin who co-ends the school him was very close friend of mine

1102
01:08:37.54 --> 01:08:40.54
And also considered a chess prodigy he was the basis for searching for Bobby Fisher

1103
01:08:40.54 --> 01:08:42.54
He says that

1104
01:08:42.54 --> 01:08:46.54
New Marcello is a nickname is the I think the king of the scramble

1105
01:08:46.54 --> 01:08:49.54
But he doesn't view it as a scramble

1106
01:08:49.54 --> 01:08:57.54
And what Josh was telling me is that Marcello can basically see a move in

1107
01:08:57.54 --> 01:09:00.54
And movement in general in more frames per second

1108
01:09:00.54 --> 01:09:05.54
So we're most people see position A transition that is kind of

1109
01:09:05.54 --> 01:09:09.54
Undefined to position B he sees 30 positions between A and B

1110
01:09:09.54 --> 01:09:14.54
And you see that when if you if you if you won't really see some wild stuff

1111
01:09:14.54 --> 01:09:18.54
You can check out this look up the Marcello team which is his brand of

1112
01:09:18.54 --> 01:09:20.54
Which is really

1113
01:09:20.54 --> 01:09:25.54
It's it's so technical for something that can be so sloppy

1114
01:09:25.54 --> 01:09:30.54
When people don't know there is so technical and he can catch people in a

1115
01:09:30.54 --> 01:09:37.54
Guilty in from any conceivable position that most people wouldn't even consider a position

1116
01:09:37.54 --> 01:09:43.54
Yeah, I've seen him I've seen him catch people in Guilty in people who weigh 300 pounds

1117
01:09:43.54 --> 01:09:46.54
And not fat 300 like big big big people

1118
01:09:46.54 --> 01:09:51.54
And then they try to come around his legs into say a north south position

1119
01:09:51.54 --> 01:09:57.54
And he gets them to tap when they appear to have him in a north south position

1120
01:09:57.54 --> 01:10:02.54
But he seems to be able to access this same type of mind state at will

1121
01:10:02.54 --> 01:10:06.54
Yeah, I mean obviously it has to do with he's training all the time

1122
01:10:06.54 --> 01:10:12.54
I mean all the time and yeah all the time and he just turns his mind off and his body is working

1123
01:10:12.54 --> 01:10:17.54
I bet you if you hooked up like brain scan and you see what he's thinking about he's probably thinking about

1124
01:10:17.54 --> 01:10:19.54
Like chicken

1125
01:10:19.54 --> 01:10:23.54
Yeah, for dinner or whatever you know, I mean like his thoughts are just not there

1126
01:10:23.54 --> 01:10:27.54
And that's how I feel when I have good when I do good you do I come off the mat

1127
01:10:27.54 --> 01:10:27.54
And I don't

1128
01:10:27.54 --> 01:10:27.54
I don't

1129
01:10:27.54 --> 01:10:29.54
Some will say hey, what was that movie?

1130
01:10:29.54 --> 01:10:33.54
Did I mean I have no idea what I just did you know I just have no idea we don't know what happened

1131
01:10:33.54 --> 01:10:37.54
And and sometimes if you're thinking about something you might remember bits and pieces

1132
01:10:37.54 --> 01:10:41.54
But that's what he's talking about in that section is like hey, it's not even

1133
01:10:41.54 --> 01:10:44.54
You're not even there. It's all the trainings there

1134
01:10:44.54 --> 01:10:48.54
Things you've been instructed the practice that you've done that's what's there

1135
01:10:48.54 --> 01:10:50.54
And that's what's executing the movements

1136
01:10:50.54 --> 01:10:54.54
It's a beautiful place to be whenever people ask me about meditation

1137
01:10:54.54 --> 01:10:55.54
Yeah

1138
01:10:55.54 --> 01:10:56.54
Like do you meditate joccal?

1139
01:10:56.54 --> 01:10:57.54
Yeah, do you do you do you do?

1140
01:10:57.54 --> 01:10:59.54
I do

1141
01:10:59.54 --> 01:11:01.54
Yeah, I think the brain

1142
01:11:01.54 --> 01:11:05.54
Yeah, I mean it's just present state awareness and not

1143
01:11:05.54 --> 01:11:11.54
Endlessly thinking about whatever it is that might occupy and distract you

1144
01:11:11.54 --> 01:11:12.54
Otherwise

1145
01:11:12.54 --> 01:11:15.54
Yeah, it gives you that and actually somebody asked me that the other day

1146
01:11:15.54 --> 01:11:20.54
I was doing an event and guys says you know how do you how do you recharge your batteries

1147
01:11:20.54 --> 01:11:24.54
Like it just seems like you're going hard all the time how do you recharge your batteries

1148
01:11:24.54 --> 01:11:28.54
And my initial I actually responded I said look I don't to be honest with you

1149
01:11:28.54 --> 01:11:31.54
I don't really recharge I mean I'm just going and there's this

1150
01:11:31.54 --> 01:11:33.54
And then as I thought about it

1151
01:11:33.54 --> 01:11:36.54
I said actually no I'm wrong I recharge all the time

1152
01:11:36.54 --> 01:11:37.54
I'm solar past

1153
01:11:37.54 --> 01:11:38.54
Yeah, I'm solar past

1154
01:11:38.54 --> 01:11:42.54
I move myself to get energized right I like the wind up watch or whatever

1155
01:11:42.54 --> 01:11:49.54
But no the reality is is I recharge myself through physical activity

1156
01:11:49.54 --> 01:11:54.54
That's where I recharge myself is by surfing into jitsu and working out that's the recharge

1157
01:11:54.54 --> 01:11:58.54
So I just to build on that because I think it's really important

1158
01:11:58.54 --> 01:12:03.54
People think of recharging as as physical rest

1159
01:12:03.54 --> 01:12:09.54
But if anyone has really gone through a very very stressful period in their lives

1160
01:12:09.54 --> 01:12:14.54
Whether that's the death of a loved one or break up anything that you obsessively think about

1161
01:12:14.54 --> 01:12:20.54
You can not move for most of the day and feel like you've run five marathons

1162
01:12:20.54 --> 01:12:25.54
So by getting out of your head and into your body say in jitsu or surfing

1163
01:12:25.54 --> 01:12:30.54
You're taking a break from these lures that we can replay

1164
01:12:30.54 --> 01:12:33.54
That are what drain the battery

1165
01:12:33.54 --> 01:12:37.54
Yeah, I think it's I you know again luckily the guy asked me that question

1166
01:12:37.54 --> 01:12:41.54
And I realized as I was answering you're first I sounded like an arrogant jerk

1167
01:12:41.54 --> 01:12:44.54
I was like oh I'm always on you know I don't need no recharge

1168
01:12:44.54 --> 01:12:49.54
Look that's not true actually if I go days without training or without working out

1169
01:12:49.54 --> 01:12:53.54
I start to feel like crap and how do I recharge I get home and I'm like oh there's my squat

1170
01:12:53.54 --> 01:12:56.54
Racken and or there's the mat and you can get on it and drain so yeah, that's

1171
01:12:58.54 --> 01:13:05.54
Totally true totally true one quick story about Marcello, which also makes me you can tell Marcello's story

1172
01:13:05.54 --> 01:13:15.54
I think about Musashi is he's famous for being hard to find when he gets called to the mat when it's his turn to compete

1173
01:13:15.54 --> 01:13:19.54
Even at a world championship level and

1174
01:13:19.54 --> 01:13:25.54
He is almost always found because Josh has had to track him down a few times a sleep

1175
01:13:25.54 --> 01:13:30.54
Like in between the bleachers and like we're selling Marcello you're up and be like oh, okay

1176
01:13:30.54 --> 01:13:36.54
Cool and who like get up and stretch and literally walk 50 feet like

1177
01:13:36.54 --> 01:13:42.54
Seven seconds later on to the mat for the finals and the world championships and just turn it on and then just throw people

1178
01:13:42.54 --> 01:13:46.54
And that's cool too and I don't know if I hit in the book, but that's Musashi

1179
01:13:46.54 --> 01:13:55.54
One of Musashi's things is Musashi would show up late. He'd have doels and he'd show up our late 15 minutes late 20 minutes late and have that person getting all frustrated

1180
01:13:55.54 --> 01:14:01.54
Yeah, no it's in in I mean you it's I was thinking about this because I I was I

1181
01:14:01.54 --> 01:14:06.54
Remember this about Musashi and I was trying to think of how to explain

1182
01:14:06.54 --> 01:14:19.54
In a culture like Japan in that period what showing up an hourly might equate to in the US it would be like coming over to meet someone at their house

1183
01:14:19.54 --> 01:14:25.54
Shaking their hands sitting down at the dinner table then like getting up on the dinner table and taking a shit right on their

1184
01:14:25.54 --> 01:14:36.54
I think it's like and then asking them to clean it up because it smells bad like it would be it would be that rude so of course and it also made me think of this book. I think it's called winning ugly

1185
01:14:36.54 --> 01:14:48.54
It's about tennis, but it relates to this form of psychological warfare and like taking too much time like in between serves and making your opponent unnerved

1186
01:14:48.54 --> 01:14:57.54
So that even if they're technically superior you can end up beating them and so Musashi it's it's the simplest trick in the book, but he would show up late late

1187
01:14:57.54 --> 01:15:08.54
And these people lose their minds and and then if they're like oh the sky always shows up late and then he shoved three hours early and scout the whole place out and then kill everybody

1188
01:15:08.54 --> 01:15:22.54
Good. This was an interesting piece. Here's another weapon and he's working with this guy who designs weapons and it's called the chain ball sickle

1189
01:15:22.54 --> 01:15:31.54
So it's like the sickle and then a chain and then a ball. Again, this is a reminds me of Kung Fu movies when I was a kid, but he's seeing this and here this guy's name is bacon

1190
01:15:31.54 --> 01:15:40.54
B-a-i-k-e-n, bacon. Did you just chime in over there at Coach Ross? Yeah, why is that?

1191
01:15:40.54 --> 01:15:47.54
Because I know, but not not many you guys do you think it's good. You speak Japanese or something you've been hoping down on me?

1192
01:15:47.54 --> 01:15:51.54
A little bit. I do like the idea of calling him bacon though.

1193
01:15:51.54 --> 01:15:56.54
I might, if I have another kid, I might name him bacon.

1194
01:15:56.54 --> 01:16:01.54
No, you know, in Hawaii the pronunciation. This is very similar. Yeah.

1195
01:16:01.54 --> 01:16:11.54
Bacon. Bacon insisted. You said you wanted to hear more about this chain ball sickle. I'll tell you everything I know, but let's have a few drinks while we're talking.

1196
01:16:11.54 --> 01:16:23.54
When E will returned with a socky, bacon poured some into a heating jar, put it on the fire and talked a great length about the chain ball sickle and ways to use it to advantage an actual combat.

1197
01:16:23.54 --> 01:16:28.54
The best thing about it he told Mousashi was that, unlike a sword, it gave the enemy no time to defend himself.

1198
01:16:28.54 --> 01:16:34.54
Also, before attacking the enemy directly, it was possible to snatch his weapon away from him with the chain.

1199
01:16:34.54 --> 01:16:43.54
A skillful throw of the chain, a sharp yank, and the enemy had no sword. Still seated, bacon, bacon, demonstrated a stance.

1200
01:16:43.54 --> 01:16:51.54
You see, you hold the sickle in your left hand and the ball in your right. If the enemy comes at you take him with

1201
01:16:51.54 --> 01:16:55.54
the blade, then hurl the ball at his face. That's one way.

1202
01:16:55.54 --> 01:17:02.54
Changing positions he went on. Now in this case, when there's some space between you and the enemy, you take his weapon away with the chain.

1203
01:17:02.54 --> 01:17:08.54
It doesn't make any difference what kind of weapon is. A sword, lance, wooden staff, or whatever.

1204
01:17:08.54 --> 01:17:15.54
Bacon went on and on telling Mousashi about the ways of throwing the ball about the ten or more oral traditions concerning the weapon,

1205
01:17:15.54 --> 01:17:22.54
about how the chain was like a snake, about how it was possible by cleverly alternating movements of the chain and sickle to create optical illusions

1206
01:17:22.54 --> 01:17:29.54
and cause the enemy's defense to work to his own detriment, about all the secret ways of using the weapon.

1207
01:17:29.54 --> 01:17:37.54
Mousashi was fascinated. When he heard talk like this, he listened with his whole body, eager to absorb every detail.

1208
01:17:37.54 --> 01:17:50.54
The chain, the sickle, two hands. As he listened, the seeds of other thoughts formed in his mind. The sword can be used with one hand, but a man has two hands.

1209
01:17:50.54 --> 01:18:00.54
And that's where he gets this idea of for using two swords when he fights. And I'm sure you know more about that than me.

1210
01:18:00.54 --> 01:18:12.54
Yeah, so he originated a style that has many different names. I think they're a few different.

1211
01:18:12.54 --> 01:18:18.54
I'm probably going to get this incorrect, but there's like neat any cheer. I think it's one way to say it.

1212
01:18:18.54 --> 01:18:36.54
But the form of having one long sword and then the equivalent of say, I would imagine in the military of a sidearm, like a pistol. So you have your primary, and then you would have your whatever it might be.

1213
01:18:36.54 --> 01:18:49.54
And then you would have a lot of 19 or whatever. And typically, same where I would use their primary and then failing that if it broke or if it would, if they were disarm, then they would use their shorter sword.

1214
01:18:49.54 --> 01:18:56.54
And he would, in some cases, utilize both simultaneously, which is very, very highly highly unusual.

1215
01:18:56.54 --> 01:19:08.54
And then they're completely different method of fighting because the grip on the sword is very, very particular when you look at say a kind of sword and how it's positioned.

1216
01:19:08.54 --> 01:19:23.54
If you, if you have then two swords, it requires a completely different repertoire of technique. And I don't know. I don't recall offhand if they get into it in this book, but with Sashi was also an expert in weaponry throwing.

1217
01:19:23.54 --> 01:19:34.54
And then in instances, and I would love to have seen this. And I'm sure there's a video on YouTube of someone trying this, but he would routinely throw his shorter sword.

1218
01:19:34.54 --> 01:19:44.54
And also later on, because he was, and I don't want to skip too far ahead, but he would also instruct in the use of shooting in which are the throwing stars.

1219
01:19:44.54 --> 01:19:57.54
And I would like to expert at throwing weapons as well as wielding the sword. And it's a completely different school of training that some people still use in Kendo.

1220
01:19:57.54 --> 01:20:02.54
At the highest levels, I haven't seen it very much because I think there aren't as many teachers.

1221
01:20:02.54 --> 01:20:05.54
Is that legal? It is legal, as far as I can tell.

1222
01:20:05.54 --> 01:20:15.54
I've seen them demonstrate it, and you can find some video, not much, but a little bit of video of using one short and one long.

1223
01:20:15.54 --> 01:20:21.54
And it's, it's, they're not a degree of difference. They're different species altogether.

1224
01:20:21.54 --> 01:20:22.54
Yeah.

1225
01:20:22.54 --> 01:20:25.54
That's weird. Sometimes when I'm rolling, you get to.

1226
01:20:25.54 --> 01:20:31.54
And you get sweaty enough and slippery enough, and it's, it's a little bit of a different sport.

1227
01:20:31.54 --> 01:20:36.54
You know, like it's like you are not going to be able to do this to me right now because it's too slippery.

1228
01:20:36.54 --> 01:20:43.54
And, and same with gui and no gui, and it's weird, you know, of course, I always tell people like gui and no gui, they're different but they're the same.

1229
01:20:43.54 --> 01:20:51.54
And then it's, it goes one degree further, because when you get to super slippery, no gui, it's, it's about the difference between gui and no gui.

1230
01:20:51.54 --> 01:20:55.54
Maybe not quite as much, but another Marcello story.

1231
01:20:55.54 --> 01:20:56.54
Yeah.

1232
01:20:56.54 --> 01:21:06.54
So I trained with Dave Kemareo for a period of time who I was one of my favorite human beings, just a sweetheart of a gui and a hell of a competitor and also high level judo.

1233
01:21:06.54 --> 01:21:07.54
Yeah.

1234
01:21:07.54 --> 01:21:17.54
And so when he competed in jujitsu, most people were terrified of his stand up and they had to kick their hips back and then he would do a flying arm bar and routinely used flying arm bars on everyone.

1235
01:21:17.54 --> 01:21:17.54
Yeah.

1236
01:21:17.54 --> 01:21:18.54
He used a total beast competitive.

1237
01:21:18.54 --> 01:21:24.54
I was on the competition circuit around the same time as him and some of the other guys we were talking about earlier.

1238
01:21:24.54 --> 01:21:26.54
And they, they were killers.

1239
01:21:26.54 --> 01:21:30.54
So Dave went to New York and trained with Marcello for a period of time.

1240
01:21:30.54 --> 01:21:33.54
And to me, I mean, Dave, he's a high level competitor.

1241
01:21:33.54 --> 01:21:37.54
Like I've never seen Dave thrown around or anything like that.

1242
01:21:37.54 --> 01:21:43.54
And so he's telling me about his experience and he's friends with Marcello, but the experience of rolling no gui.

1243
01:21:43.54 --> 01:21:46.54
And I was like, oh well, that makes, I suppose that makes sense.

1244
01:21:46.54 --> 01:21:51.54
I've heard so much about Marcello, but once you put on the gui, it was different game.

1245
01:21:51.54 --> 01:21:56.54
I assume because of all your experience at jujitsu and he's like, no, it was even worse.

1246
01:21:56.54 --> 01:21:59.54
Yeah, I find that with Dean of the club.

1247
01:21:59.54 --> 01:22:03.54
My buddy Dean is, you know, a world champion multiple times with no gui.

1248
01:22:03.54 --> 01:22:07.54
And everyone thinks, oh, well, if you put the gui on, maybe you can neutralize some stuff.

1249
01:22:07.54 --> 01:22:10.54
No, it's worse because you can't move at all.

1250
01:22:10.54 --> 01:22:13.54
And he, and it's not like he doesn't know jujitsu with gui.

1251
01:22:13.54 --> 01:22:15.54
He's savage.

1252
01:22:15.54 --> 01:22:19.54
So if someone's really good, he gives him more control.

1253
01:22:19.54 --> 01:22:22.54
They already have control over you. Now they have even more control.

1254
01:22:22.54 --> 01:22:23.54
Now they have handles.

1255
01:22:23.54 --> 01:22:24.54
Yeah, it's not fun.

1256
01:22:24.54 --> 01:22:29.54
You got one you want to read?

1257
01:22:29.54 --> 01:22:38.54
You know, yeah, I want to just, these are, these are things that I highlighted when I was really just coming into the professional world.

1258
01:22:38.54 --> 01:22:44.54
And felt like I needed to toughen myself on a number of different levels.

1259
01:22:44.54 --> 01:22:46.54
And this is one that I highlighted.

1260
01:22:46.54 --> 01:22:51.54
This is from fairly early in the book, which means it's like the end of a normal book.

1261
01:22:51.54 --> 01:22:53.54
Early in the book.

1262
01:22:53.54 --> 01:22:56.54
And it's talking about a period of his traveling.

1263
01:22:56.54 --> 01:22:59.54
And he says, or I should say, read,

1264
01:22:59.54 --> 01:23:02.54
He stopped along the way to look at several well known temples.

1265
01:23:02.54 --> 01:23:04.54
And at each of them, he bowed and said, two prayers.

1266
01:23:04.54 --> 01:23:07.54
One was, please protect my sister from harm.

1267
01:23:07.54 --> 01:23:11.54
The other was, please test the lowly moussaishi with hardship.

1268
01:23:11.54 --> 01:23:15.54
Let him become the greatest swordsman in the land or let him die.

1269
01:23:15.54 --> 01:23:20.54
Please test the lowly moussaishi with hardship.

1270
01:23:20.54 --> 01:23:22.54
That's what he's praying for.

1271
01:23:22.54 --> 01:23:26.54
And that's what you would think when you were getting into the professional world, you're like,

1272
01:23:26.54 --> 01:23:27.54
All right, bring it.

1273
01:23:27.54 --> 01:23:28.54
Because you were scared.

1274
01:23:28.54 --> 01:23:30.54
You think you were scared about what was going to happen?

1275
01:23:30.54 --> 01:23:37.54
I knew that I had relatively high pain tolerance.

1276
01:23:37.54 --> 01:23:41.54
And I could handle a lot of workload.

1277
01:23:41.54 --> 01:23:48.54
So I was preparing myself for several years of being lowest on the total pole and suffering.

1278
01:23:48.54 --> 01:23:49.54
God.

1279
01:23:49.54 --> 01:23:57.54
But making up for a lack of experience by just absorbing more punishment in the form of just working

1280
01:23:57.54 --> 01:24:01.54
all your hours, work hard, doing more, always doing more.

1281
01:24:01.54 --> 01:24:04.54
And serve me well at the time.

1282
01:24:04.54 --> 01:24:06.54
God an idea for a book anyways.

1283
01:24:06.54 --> 01:24:07.54
I guess.

1284
01:24:07.54 --> 01:24:08.54
Exactly.

1285
01:24:08.54 --> 01:24:13.54
And then when I disintegrated and self-employed it, I had an idea for a book.

1286
01:24:13.54 --> 01:24:15.54
Yeah, there's go.

1287
01:24:15.54 --> 01:24:17.54
This is another one.

1288
01:24:17.54 --> 01:24:21.54
And it's referring to, I believe.

1289
01:24:21.54 --> 01:24:27.54
Moussaishi's writing and it says, well, his writing has a certain childish quality.

1290
01:24:27.54 --> 01:24:28.54
But there's an appealing.

1291
01:24:28.54 --> 01:24:30.54
What can I say, directness about it?

1292
01:24:30.54 --> 01:24:34.54
If I had a swordsman in mind, I would say it shows spiritual breadth.

1293
01:24:34.54 --> 01:24:36.54
The boy may eventually be somebody.

1294
01:24:36.54 --> 01:24:38.54
I just like that.

1295
01:24:38.54 --> 01:24:40.54
The childish directness.

1296
01:24:40.54 --> 01:24:41.54
Yeah.

1297
01:24:41.54 --> 01:24:44.54
Yeah, those good stuff.

1298
01:24:44.54 --> 01:24:47.54
And again, that's what you were thinking about yourself.

1299
01:24:47.54 --> 01:24:52.54
Like, hey, at that time you were the young swordsman coming up in the business world.

1300
01:24:52.54 --> 01:24:53.54
That's right.

1301
01:24:53.54 --> 01:24:55.54
Having to make things happen.

1302
01:24:55.54 --> 01:25:01.54
There's another fight scene here.

1303
01:25:01.54 --> 01:25:03.54
He called him fight scenes.

1304
01:25:03.54 --> 01:25:06.54
I don't know if that sounds like a movie, a kung fu movie.

1305
01:25:06.54 --> 01:25:10.54
Not that there's anything wrong with kung fu movies because some kung fu movies are awesome.

1306
01:25:10.54 --> 01:25:13.54
But some of them are also cheesy.

1307
01:25:13.54 --> 01:25:14.54
Sure.

1308
01:25:14.54 --> 01:25:17.54
The or movie professional there, echo troughs.

1309
01:25:17.54 --> 01:25:20.54
Yeah, I don't think you'd be called a scene if it's in a book.

1310
01:25:20.54 --> 01:25:21.54
Okay.

1311
01:25:21.54 --> 01:25:22.54
I don't know though.

1312
01:25:22.54 --> 01:25:23.54
I don't know.

1313
01:25:23.54 --> 01:25:25.54
Is this not a scene if it's in a book?

1314
01:25:25.54 --> 01:25:26.54
I think it could be.

1315
01:25:26.54 --> 01:25:27.54
We could use a scene.

1316
01:25:27.54 --> 01:25:29.54
It reads like a screenplay.

1317
01:25:29.54 --> 01:25:32.54
So if it were a screenplay, we could call it a beat or a scene, I think.

1318
01:25:32.54 --> 01:25:34.54
Here's a scene.

1319
01:25:34.54 --> 01:25:40.54
After an inner, this is a fight with a guy named Denshin Chiro.

1320
01:25:40.54 --> 01:25:49.54
After an interval of two or three breaths, Denshin Chiro shouted, Musashi, he was well aware that the man standing several feet above him was in a very advantageous position.

1321
01:25:49.54 --> 01:25:57.54
Not only was he perfectly safe from the rear, but anyone trying to attack him either from the right or left would first have to climb up to his level.

1322
01:25:57.54 --> 01:26:00.54
He was thus free to devote his entire attention to the enemy before him.

1323
01:26:00.54 --> 01:26:02.54
So he's about to fight this guy.

1324
01:26:02.54 --> 01:26:05.54
And as you said earlier, sometimes he shows up late, sometimes he shows up early.

1325
01:26:05.54 --> 01:26:08.54
In this case, he showed up early and he got an elevated position.

1326
01:26:08.54 --> 01:26:12.54
And so his enemy, Denshin Chiro, is sitting there looking going, oh, this sucks.

1327
01:26:12.54 --> 01:26:14.54
I'm below him.

1328
01:26:14.54 --> 01:26:17.54
And he's protected from the back and left and right.

1329
01:26:17.54 --> 01:26:22.54
And then Musashi says, are you ready?

1330
01:26:22.54 --> 01:26:25.54
Musashi's question was calm but trenchant.

1331
01:26:25.54 --> 01:26:30.54
Falling like so much ice water on his opponent's feverish excitement.

1332
01:26:30.54 --> 01:26:34.54
Denshin Chiro now got his first good look at Musashi.

1333
01:26:34.54 --> 01:26:36.54
So this is the bastard he thought.

1334
01:26:36.54 --> 01:26:40.54
His hatred was total. He resented the maiming of his brother.

1335
01:26:40.54 --> 01:26:44.54
He was vexed at being compared with Musashi by the common people.

1336
01:26:44.54 --> 01:26:50.54
And he had an ingrained contempt for what he regarded as a country upstart posing as a samurai.

1337
01:26:50.54 --> 01:26:52.54
Who are you to ask? Are you ready?

1338
01:26:52.54 --> 01:26:55.54
It is well past the hour of nine.

1339
01:26:55.54 --> 01:26:57.54
Did I say I'd be here exactly at nine?

1340
01:26:57.54 --> 01:26:58.54
Don't make excuses.

1341
01:26:58.54 --> 01:27:00.54
I've been waiting a long time.

1342
01:27:00.54 --> 01:27:02.54
As you can see, I'm fully prepared.

1343
01:27:02.54 --> 01:27:04.54
Now come down from there.

1344
01:27:04.54 --> 01:27:11.54
He did not underestimate his opponent in the extent of daring attack from his present position.

1345
01:27:11.54 --> 01:27:15.54
In a minute, answered Musashi with a slight laugh.

1346
01:27:15.54 --> 01:27:20.54
There was a difference between Musashi's idea of preparation and his opponents.

1347
01:27:20.54 --> 01:27:27.54
Denshin Chiro, though physically prepared, had only begun to pull himself together spiritually,

1348
01:27:27.54 --> 01:27:32.54
whereas Musashi had started fighting long before he presented himself to his enemy.

1349
01:27:32.54 --> 01:27:38.54
For him, the battle was now entering its second and central phase.

1350
01:27:38.54 --> 01:27:42.54
At the Guion Shrine, he had seen the footprints in the snow,

1351
01:27:42.54 --> 01:27:45.54
and at that moment his fighting instinct had been aroused.

1352
01:27:45.54 --> 01:27:51.54
Knowing that the shadow of the man following him was no longer there, he had bowled the end of the gate,

1353
01:27:51.54 --> 01:27:54.54
and made a quick approach to the kitchen.

1354
01:27:54.54 --> 01:28:01.54
Having awakened the priest, he struck up a conversation, suddenly questioning the man as to what had been going on earlier in the evening.

1355
01:28:01.54 --> 01:28:08.54
Denshin Chiro, disregarding the fact that he was a little late, he had had some tea and warmed himself up.

1356
01:28:08.54 --> 01:28:13.54
Then when he made his appearance, it was abrupt and from relative safety of the veranda.

1357
01:28:13.54 --> 01:28:16.54
He had seized the initiative.

1358
01:28:16.54 --> 01:28:20.54
I guess I was wrong in this section. He doesn't show up late, but he shows up late,

1359
01:28:20.54 --> 01:28:26.54
but he gets to an advantageous position without the other guy realizing it, which is just as cool.

1360
01:28:26.54 --> 01:28:27.54
Did you find one?

1361
01:28:27.54 --> 01:28:29.54
I've got so many.

1362
01:28:29.54 --> 01:28:37.54
This one is good, because it highlights how profound is maybe too strong a word,

1363
01:28:37.54 --> 01:28:44.54
but deep some of the characters in the book are besides Musashi,

1364
01:28:44.54 --> 01:28:47.54
because there are quite a few characters in here.

1365
01:28:47.54 --> 01:28:54.54
This is a teacher, this is an exchange between, as far as I can tell,

1366
01:28:54.54 --> 01:29:04.54
Kizai Mon who is one of the teachers or a prospective teacher, and Musashi has brought a letter that he wants.

1367
01:29:04.54 --> 01:29:10.54
He's I'm one to read, which is some type of request for instruction.

1368
01:29:10.54 --> 01:29:14.54
And Kizai Mon is ignoring both Musashi and the letter.

1369
01:29:14.54 --> 01:29:17.54
And he says, but just please read the letter, I don't want to.

1370
01:29:17.54 --> 01:29:20.54
Just please read the letter, no, I'm not going to read your letter.

1371
01:29:20.54 --> 01:29:22.54
And then he says, please read the letter.

1372
01:29:22.54 --> 01:29:24.54
I don't need to.

1373
01:29:24.54 --> 01:29:26.54
And then Musashi says, what's the matter?

1374
01:29:26.54 --> 01:29:27.54
Can't you read?

1375
01:29:27.54 --> 01:29:28.54
Because I'm unsnored.

1376
01:29:28.54 --> 01:29:33.54
And then Musashi says, well, if you can read it, this is what he says.

1377
01:29:33.54 --> 01:29:34.54
You're a tricky brat.

1378
01:29:34.54 --> 01:29:38.54
The reason I said I don't need to read it is that I already know what it says.

1379
01:29:38.54 --> 01:29:42.54
Musashi says, even so wouldn't it be more polite to read it?

1380
01:29:42.54 --> 01:29:44.54
And this is how the teacher responds.

1381
01:29:44.54 --> 01:29:47.54
Student warriors swarm here like mosquitoes and maggots.

1382
01:29:47.54 --> 01:29:51.54
If I took time to be polite to all of them, I wouldn't be able to do anything else.

1383
01:29:51.54 --> 01:29:54.54
And then he continues, I feel sorry for you however.

1384
01:29:54.54 --> 01:29:57.54
So I'll tell you what the letter says, all right.

1385
01:29:57.54 --> 01:30:01.54
This piece right here is just good.

1386
01:30:01.54 --> 01:30:08.54
This is the continuation of that that fight scene, which actually goes on for multiple pages.

1387
01:30:08.54 --> 01:30:12.54
His technique is better than mine, Musashi thought candidly.

1388
01:30:12.54 --> 01:30:22.54
He had the same feeling of inferiority at Kauyu Gaio Castle when he had been encircled by the four leading swordsmen of the Yagu school.

1389
01:30:22.54 --> 01:30:30.54
It was always this way when he faced swordsmen of the unorthodox schools for his own technique was without form or reason.

1390
01:30:30.54 --> 01:30:34.54
Nothing more really than a doer die method.

1391
01:30:34.54 --> 01:30:43.54
Staring at Detshin Chero, he saw that the style Yoshika Kempo had created and spent his life.

1392
01:30:43.54 --> 01:30:54.54
Both simply simplicity and complexity was well-ordered and systematic and was not to be overcome by brute strength or spirit alone.

1393
01:30:54.54 --> 01:31:01.54
Musashi was cautious about making any unnecessary movements, his primitive tactics refused to come into play.

1394
01:31:01.54 --> 01:31:06.54
To an extent that surprised him, his arms rebelled against being extended.

1395
01:31:06.54 --> 01:31:10.54
The best he could do is maintain a conservative defensive stance and wait.

1396
01:31:10.54 --> 01:31:15.54
His eyes grew red searching for an opening. He prayed to Hachiman for victory.

1397
01:31:15.54 --> 01:31:22.54
And then they go through and it's this dead silence snow accumulated on Musashi's hair.

1398
01:31:22.54 --> 01:31:27.54
And then he kind of breaks him down mentally.

1399
01:31:27.54 --> 01:31:30.54
Detshin Chero's feet inched forward.

1400
01:31:30.54 --> 01:31:35.54
At the tip of his sword, his willpower quivered toward the start of a movement.

1401
01:31:35.54 --> 01:31:39.54
Two lives expired with two strokes of a single sword.

1402
01:31:39.54 --> 01:31:41.54
First, Musashi attacked to his rear.

1403
01:31:41.54 --> 01:31:45.54
So a guy had snuck up behind him. Musashi kills that guy and then kills.

1404
01:31:45.54 --> 01:31:50.54
It's just another great battle scene.

1405
01:31:50.54 --> 01:31:55.54
And the eyes, they talk about the eyes quite a bit in this book.

1406
01:31:55.54 --> 01:32:01.54
And I'll come back to Kenno where you experience something that's very uncommon in Japanese culture,

1407
01:32:01.54 --> 01:32:04.54
which is really intense direct eye contact.

1408
01:32:04.54 --> 01:32:08.54
Doesn't happen a whole lot in Japanese culture even in the martial arts.

1409
01:32:08.54 --> 01:32:14.54
In judo, it's more of a relaxed gaze and you might come out first and there's some yelling.

1410
01:32:14.54 --> 01:32:19.54
So you'll hear that quite a bit. I don't know if non-Japanese do it, but in Japan, when I was watching certain people,

1411
01:32:19.54 --> 01:32:23.54
or competing myself and you'd hear people like you.

1412
01:32:23.54 --> 01:32:24.54
You're shy.

1413
01:32:24.54 --> 01:32:27.54
And after they bow, they'll let out a bit of a scream.

1414
01:32:27.54 --> 01:32:30.54
But then it's down to business.

1415
01:32:30.54 --> 01:32:36.54
And in Kenno, you hear a lot more vocalization and really intense eye contact.

1416
01:32:36.54 --> 01:32:38.54
Are you trained to look at their eyes?

1417
01:32:38.54 --> 01:32:39.54
Yeah.

1418
01:32:39.54 --> 01:32:39.54
Okay.

1419
01:32:39.54 --> 01:32:42.54
So where do you look in wrestling?

1420
01:32:42.54 --> 01:32:47.54
In wrestling, and I should say, I mean, I was a decent high school wrestler,

1421
01:32:47.54 --> 01:32:51.54
I had a good competitive record, but I wouldn't consider myself anywhere.

1422
01:32:51.54 --> 01:32:54.54
Like a D1 wrestler, just mop the floor with me.

1423
01:32:54.54 --> 01:33:00.54
But I would typically have kind of more of a soft, like hips.

1424
01:33:00.54 --> 01:33:03.54
I mean, I'm always looking at people's chest and every sport.

1425
01:33:03.54 --> 01:33:05.54
I'm looking at like naval and chest.

1426
01:33:05.54 --> 01:33:08.54
I usually kind of watch in the hips in wrestling.

1427
01:33:08.54 --> 01:33:09.54
Yeah.

1428
01:33:09.54 --> 01:33:11.54
But in Kenpo, they teach you to look at the eyes.

1429
01:33:11.54 --> 01:33:12.54
In Kenno.

1430
01:33:12.54 --> 01:33:13.54
Oh, sorry.

1431
01:33:13.54 --> 01:33:18.54
I know they teach you to look at the eyes.

1432
01:33:18.54 --> 01:33:21.54
And are you looking for like to see what they're going to do?

1433
01:33:21.54 --> 01:33:23.54
That's where you're going to see their movement.

1434
01:33:23.54 --> 01:33:26.54
You know, there isn't any explicit instruction in why.

1435
01:33:26.54 --> 01:33:29.54
But you can unicate a lot with your eyes.

1436
01:33:29.54 --> 01:33:32.54
And so you can tell if someone's intimidated.

1437
01:33:32.54 --> 01:33:35.54
You can tell if someone's angry.

1438
01:33:35.54 --> 01:33:36.54
You can tell.

1439
01:33:36.54 --> 01:33:38.54
You can also throw people off.

1440
01:33:38.54 --> 01:33:41.54
So for instance, I mean, you have men, though, cold day and all this stuff.

1441
01:33:41.54 --> 01:33:45.54
And I realize pretty quickly is that much like and say,

1442
01:33:45.54 --> 01:33:46.54
Moitai.

1443
01:33:46.54 --> 01:33:47.54
So it's high kick boxing.

1444
01:33:47.54 --> 01:33:50.54
One of the oldest tricks in the book, which is really, really unpleasant.

1445
01:33:50.54 --> 01:33:52.54
If you happen to get caught with it.

1446
01:33:52.54 --> 01:33:56.54
He is particular, at least since I, I gagged well up to say,

1447
01:33:56.54 --> 01:33:59.54
I got caught with it when I went to Japan because I wanted to also

1448
01:33:59.54 --> 01:34:01.54
cross train in striking.

1449
01:34:01.54 --> 01:34:03.54
And so I went to a number of schools, including a place called

1450
01:34:03.54 --> 01:34:05.54
Seidel Kai-Kang.

1451
01:34:05.54 --> 01:34:08.54
And Kang is, is it's at the end of like cold or con.

1452
01:34:08.54 --> 01:34:10.54
This, this con, whatever it is.

1453
01:34:10.54 --> 01:34:12.54
It's a place of practice, right?

1454
01:34:12.54 --> 01:34:19.54
And first time I sparred someone in the karate schools in Japan, like

1455
01:34:19.54 --> 01:34:23.54
Kilkoshi and then so on, they don't have head contact with the

1456
01:34:23.54 --> 01:34:24.54
fists, but it's bare fisted.

1457
01:34:24.54 --> 01:34:27.54
So you're punching each other in the chest, body and so on.

1458
01:34:27.54 --> 01:34:30.54
And this guy was wailing on my legs.

1459
01:34:30.54 --> 01:34:33.54
He was just like hitting me with these, these roundhouse kicks

1460
01:34:33.54 --> 01:34:34.54
to the legs.

1461
01:34:34.54 --> 01:34:37.54
And I'd never even seen like kicks before.

1462
01:34:37.54 --> 01:34:41.54
So I was punching him right in the chest, like just below his collarbone, right

1463
01:34:41.54 --> 01:34:44.54
below his throat, and then punching him in the stomach, and he was kicking me in

1464
01:34:44.54 --> 01:34:45.54
the legs.

1465
01:34:45.54 --> 01:34:47.54
I was like, hey bro, I'll do this all day long.

1466
01:34:47.54 --> 01:34:50.54
And so, I'm punching the chest and I had to skip school in the next

1467
01:34:50.54 --> 01:34:52.54
day because I couldn't rock.

1468
01:34:52.54 --> 01:34:56.54
But the trick in my tie that you see a lot is like, look at the

1469
01:34:56.54 --> 01:34:57.54
leg.

1470
01:34:57.54 --> 01:34:58.54
Look at the leg.

1471
01:34:58.54 --> 01:34:59.54
Look at the leg.

1472
01:34:59.54 --> 01:35:00.54
Look at the leg.

1473
01:35:00.54 --> 01:35:01.54
Look at the leg.

1474
01:35:01.54 --> 01:35:02.54
Look at the leg.

1475
01:35:02.54 --> 01:35:04.54
Look at the leg.

1476
01:35:04.54 --> 01:35:05.54
Look it can still really.

1477
01:35:05.54 --> 01:35:08.06
And you see a lot of people get knocked out that way.

1478
01:35:08.06 --> 01:35:11.66
So in Kenno, you can do something very similar

1479
01:35:11.66 --> 01:35:15.66
where you're sort of telegraphing deliberately with your eyes

1480
01:35:15.66 --> 01:35:17.46
and going for a certain target, you get parry.

1481
01:35:17.46 --> 01:35:19.66
You do that four or five times and then you

1482
01:35:19.66 --> 01:35:23.30
telegraph the same way and go for a different target.

1483
01:35:23.30 --> 01:35:27.58
But yeah, the eye contact is really intense.

1484
01:35:27.58 --> 01:35:30.90
And if you watch Kenno, let's say YouTube

1485
01:35:30.90 --> 01:35:33.50
and imagine what the eye contact is like,

1486
01:35:33.50 --> 01:35:36.50
if their eyes are like wide open staring at each other,

1487
01:35:36.50 --> 01:35:42.18
it adds another layer of flavor to the entire experience.

1488
01:35:42.18 --> 01:35:43.94
And then you can read a passage like this

1489
01:35:43.94 --> 01:35:46.78
and you're like, oh, God, I can see it.

1490
01:35:46.78 --> 01:35:48.26
And it's opposite of GJ2,

1491
01:35:48.26 --> 01:35:50.18
where you don't really look at the person.

1492
01:35:50.18 --> 01:35:52.26
It's almost like the little unwritten rule.

1493
01:35:52.26 --> 01:35:53.90
Like don't know eye contact.

1494
01:35:53.90 --> 01:35:55.90
Yeah.

1495
01:35:55.90 --> 01:35:57.98
No gazing lovingly into someone's eyes.

1496
01:35:57.98 --> 01:36:01.98
I only do it purposefully when I'm trying to really mess

1497
01:36:01.98 --> 01:36:02.98
with someone.

1498
01:36:02.98 --> 01:36:07.98
Oh, I just look right at him and shake my head very subtly.

1499
01:36:07.98 --> 01:36:08.98
Yeah.

1500
01:36:08.98 --> 01:36:14.26
And you probably noticed that they never really look at you.

1501
01:36:14.26 --> 01:36:15.94
Unless you do it super deliberately.

1502
01:36:15.94 --> 01:36:17.98
Like if you try to roll with someone, when you roll with someone,

1503
01:36:17.98 --> 01:36:20.42
try to like notice where they're looking.

1504
01:36:20.42 --> 01:36:21.82
It's almost like they're just blank.

1505
01:36:21.82 --> 01:36:22.66
Yeah.

1506
01:36:22.66 --> 01:36:23.66
I try to work with you.

1507
01:36:23.66 --> 01:36:24.66
The blank.

1508
01:36:24.66 --> 01:36:25.66
Yeah.

1509
01:36:25.66 --> 01:36:27.26
I mean, that's a weird thing too.

1510
01:36:27.26 --> 01:36:29.42
It's what you do to you don't even have to use your eyes.

1511
01:36:29.42 --> 01:36:32.02
Like I used to notice I don't notice it so much anymore.

1512
01:36:32.02 --> 01:36:33.90
I used to notice if someone was in a good position on me,

1513
01:36:33.90 --> 01:36:35.58
I would actually close my eyes.

1514
01:36:35.58 --> 01:36:38.50
I started viewing it like I was not, it was a wasn't smart.

1515
01:36:38.50 --> 01:36:40.66
Like I was doing it to relax myself.

1516
01:36:40.66 --> 01:36:41.66
Someone gets in a good position.

1517
01:36:41.66 --> 01:36:43.90
I just closed my eyes because you know where they are.

1518
01:36:43.90 --> 01:36:46.82
They're freaking on your back or they're across the side.

1519
01:36:46.82 --> 01:36:49.14
You know exactly where they are, but I would just close my eyes

1520
01:36:49.14 --> 01:36:49.78
to kind of relax.

1521
01:36:49.78 --> 01:36:52.34
I don't do it anymore because it seems like a bad idea, right?

1522
01:36:52.34 --> 01:36:53.34
Why would you close your eyes?

1523
01:36:53.34 --> 01:36:54.94
That's stupid.

1524
01:36:54.94 --> 01:36:55.94
It burns a lot of energy though.

1525
01:36:55.94 --> 01:36:59.30
I remember doing training with Leard Hamilton,

1526
01:36:59.30 --> 01:37:03.10
who's one of the most famous big wave surfers of all time.

1527
01:37:03.10 --> 01:37:04.10
Yeah.

1528
01:37:04.10 --> 01:37:05.90
If anyone hasn't seen the documentary, writing giants,

1529
01:37:05.90 --> 01:37:08.34
oh my god, go see that.

1530
01:37:08.34 --> 01:37:11.54
The invention of toe and surfing, holy god.

1531
01:37:11.54 --> 01:37:14.18
And he leard his beast.

1532
01:37:14.18 --> 01:37:16.70
I mean, he's one of the most incredible physical specimens

1533
01:37:16.70 --> 01:37:17.54
I've ever seen.

1534
01:37:17.54 --> 01:37:20.14
He's in his 50s and just wipes the floor with,

1535
01:37:20.14 --> 01:37:24.42
like first round draft picks routinely in terms of workouts.

1536
01:37:24.42 --> 01:37:28.94
And he likes to do a lot of underwater training with weights.

1537
01:37:28.94 --> 01:37:32.22
And he's devised all of these original exercises.

1538
01:37:32.22 --> 01:37:36.14
Like there's one called ammo boxes where you hold a dumbbell.

1539
01:37:36.14 --> 01:37:38.62
He holds a 50 pound dumbbell to his chest

1540
01:37:38.62 --> 01:37:41.98
and then swims across the surface of the pool

1541
01:37:41.98 --> 01:37:45.46
or just slightly submerged with one arm.

1542
01:37:45.46 --> 01:37:47.90
And then does all manner of different exercises.

1543
01:37:47.90 --> 01:37:52.18
And his wife Gabby Rees, who is also a world class athlete

1544
01:37:52.18 --> 01:37:53.58
of her own, right?

1545
01:37:53.58 --> 01:37:56.30
Said to me, relax your eyes because underwater,

1546
01:37:56.30 --> 01:37:58.94
when I'm holding like 250 pound dumbbells,

1547
01:37:58.94 --> 01:38:00.86
understandably my eyes are bugging out of my head

1548
01:38:00.86 --> 01:38:02.34
and she's like you're burning too much energy.

1549
01:38:02.34 --> 01:38:04.14
She's like try relaxing your eyes.

1550
01:38:04.14 --> 01:38:07.98
And I could hold my breath for another 10, 15 seconds,

1551
01:38:07.98 --> 01:38:09.54
just by relaxing my eyes.

1552
01:38:10.78 --> 01:38:14.66
And just another side note that's related.

1553
01:38:14.66 --> 01:38:17.10
And I think relates to a lot in this book also,

1554
01:38:17.10 --> 01:38:21.66
not just jujitsu, is in tango, making it a point

1555
01:38:21.66 --> 01:38:23.66
to bring up tango every time we talk publicly.

1556
01:38:23.66 --> 01:38:26.66
But not cool, not cool.

1557
01:38:26.66 --> 01:38:30.86
Hey, this is the best female dancers

1558
01:38:30.86 --> 01:38:33.66
very frequently close their eyes

1559
01:38:33.66 --> 01:38:37.46
because if they try to read the males movement

1560
01:38:37.46 --> 01:38:40.18
in order to respond, it's already too late.

1561
01:38:40.18 --> 01:38:42.14
If they try to do it visually, it's too late.

1562
01:38:42.14 --> 01:38:44.90
And I think that with a lot of martial arts,

1563
01:38:44.90 --> 01:38:48.30
certainly, that in particular with grappling,

1564
01:38:48.30 --> 01:38:50.06
I mean, your body is always going to sense it

1565
01:38:50.06 --> 01:38:51.78
before your eyes can interpret it.

1566
01:38:51.78 --> 01:38:54.34
Maybe that's why I was doing it originally.

1567
01:38:54.34 --> 01:38:56.78
Much like the female tango dancer.

1568
01:38:56.78 --> 01:38:57.62
Sure.

1569
01:38:57.62 --> 01:39:01.62
So I remember Greg had a drill where you'd start back to back.

1570
01:39:01.62 --> 01:39:02.70
And he said, OK, you got to close your eyes.

1571
01:39:02.70 --> 01:39:03.26
It's going to trust you.

1572
01:39:03.26 --> 01:39:04.26
You got to close your eyes.

1573
01:39:04.26 --> 01:39:06.06
And then grapple.

1574
01:39:06.06 --> 01:39:08.82
And I remember doing it and think, oh, it's not that much harder.

1575
01:39:08.82 --> 01:39:11.26
It's like as long as you're already connected with it.

1576
01:39:11.26 --> 01:39:13.30
It's not that much harder.

1577
01:39:14.50 --> 01:39:19.30
So speaking of tango dancing and women,

1578
01:39:19.30 --> 01:39:26.30
he's, again, Otu is in and out of the book.

1579
01:39:26.30 --> 01:39:28.74
And at this point, he is heading to a battle

1580
01:39:28.74 --> 01:39:32.58
in the Audzur against him and Otu wants to go in with him.

1581
01:39:32.58 --> 01:39:35.38
And she actually wants to die if he dies.

1582
01:39:35.38 --> 01:39:37.58
And so he's having a conversation with her.

1583
01:39:37.58 --> 01:39:38.38
And here we go.

1584
01:39:38.38 --> 01:39:40.22
Don't be a fool, Otu.

1585
01:39:40.22 --> 01:39:41.22
He's suddenly blurred.

1586
01:39:41.22 --> 01:39:43.66
There's no reason why you should die.

1587
01:39:43.66 --> 01:39:46.30
The strength in his own voice and the depth of his feeling

1588
01:39:46.30 --> 01:39:48.26
surprised even him.

1589
01:39:48.26 --> 01:39:51.82
There's one thing from you to die fighting against the Yoshiokas.

1590
01:39:51.82 --> 01:39:54.58
Not only is it right for a man who lives by the sword

1591
01:39:54.58 --> 01:39:58.74
to die by the sword, I have a duty to remind those cowards

1592
01:39:58.74 --> 01:40:00.74
of the way of the samurai.

1593
01:40:00.74 --> 01:40:02.50
You're willingness to follow me to death

1594
01:40:02.50 --> 01:40:05.78
is deeply touching, but what good would it do?

1595
01:40:05.78 --> 01:40:10.50
No more than the pitiful death of an insect.

1596
01:40:10.50 --> 01:40:13.78
Seeing her burst into tears, you regretted the brutality

1597
01:40:13.78 --> 01:40:15.90
of his words.

1598
01:40:15.90 --> 01:40:19.50
Now I understand how over the years I've lied to you

1599
01:40:19.50 --> 01:40:21.06
and I've lied to myself.

1600
01:40:21.06 --> 01:40:23.50
I didn't intend to deceive you when we ran away

1601
01:40:23.50 --> 01:40:25.94
from the bridge, from the village, or when I saw you

1602
01:40:25.94 --> 01:40:29.46
at Hanada Bridge, but I did by pretending to be cold

1603
01:40:29.46 --> 01:40:30.86
and indifferent.

1604
01:40:30.86 --> 01:40:33.90
That wasn't the way I really felt.

1605
01:40:33.90 --> 01:40:36.50
In a little while, I'll be dead.

1606
01:40:36.50 --> 01:40:39.02
What I'm trying, what I'm about to say is the truth.

1607
01:40:39.02 --> 01:40:40.38
I love you, Otu.

1608
01:40:40.38 --> 01:40:43.66
I throw everything to the four winds and live out my life

1609
01:40:43.66 --> 01:40:44.58
with you.

1610
01:40:44.58 --> 01:40:48.06
If only after a moment's pause he continued

1611
01:40:48.06 --> 01:40:51.42
in a more forceful vein, you must believe every word I say

1612
01:40:51.42 --> 01:40:54.26
because I'll never have another chance to tell you this.

1613
01:40:54.26 --> 01:40:57.02
I speak with neither pride nor pretence.

1614
01:40:57.02 --> 01:40:58.94
There have been days when I couldn't concentrate

1615
01:40:58.94 --> 01:41:01.14
for thinking about you nights I couldn't sleep

1616
01:41:01.14 --> 01:41:04.10
for dreaming of you hot passionate dreams.

1617
01:41:04.10 --> 01:41:07.14
Otu dreams that nearly drove me mad,

1618
01:41:07.14 --> 01:41:11.22
often I've hugged my palate, pretending it was you.

1619
01:41:11.22 --> 01:41:13.30
But even when I felt like that,

1620
01:41:13.30 --> 01:41:15.82
if I took out my sword and looked at it,

1621
01:41:15.82 --> 01:41:19.10
the madness evaporated and my blood cooled,

1622
01:41:20.18 --> 01:41:23.02
her face turned toward him, tearful, but as radiant

1623
01:41:23.02 --> 01:41:26.34
as the morning glory, she started to speak,

1624
01:41:26.34 --> 01:41:29.62
seeing the fervor in his eyes, her words caught in her throat

1625
01:41:29.62 --> 01:41:32.14
and she looked again at the ground,

1626
01:41:32.14 --> 01:41:34.38
the sword is my refuge.

1627
01:41:34.38 --> 01:41:37.50
Anytime my passion threatens to overcome me,

1628
01:41:37.50 --> 01:41:40.66
I force myself back into the world of swordsmanship.

1629
01:41:40.66 --> 01:41:43.02
This is my fate, Otu.

1630
01:41:43.02 --> 01:41:46.10
I'm torn between love and self-discipline.

1631
01:41:46.10 --> 01:41:48.90
I seem to be traveling on two paths at once,

1632
01:41:48.90 --> 01:41:50.58
yet when the past diverge,

1633
01:41:50.58 --> 01:41:53.90
I invariably manage to keep myself on the right one.

1634
01:41:54.98 --> 01:41:57.14
I know myself better than anyone does,

1635
01:41:57.14 --> 01:41:59.34
I'm either genius nor a great man.

1636
01:42:00.34 --> 01:42:01.90
He became silent again,

1637
01:42:01.90 --> 01:42:04.94
despite his desires to express his feelings honestly,

1638
01:42:04.94 --> 01:42:08.02
his words seem to be concealing the truth.

1639
01:42:08.98 --> 01:42:11.66
His heart told him to be even more candid.

1640
01:42:11.66 --> 01:42:13.54
That's the kind of man I am.

1641
01:42:13.54 --> 01:42:15.18
What else can I say?

1642
01:42:15.18 --> 01:42:17.78
I think of my sword and you disappear

1643
01:42:17.78 --> 01:42:20.54
into some dark corner of my mind.

1644
01:42:20.54 --> 01:42:24.66
No disappear altogether, leaving no trace.

1645
01:42:25.66 --> 01:42:28.86
At times like that, I'm happiest and most satisfied

1646
01:42:28.86 --> 01:42:30.62
with my life.

1647
01:42:30.62 --> 01:42:31.74
Do you understand?

1648
01:42:31.74 --> 01:42:33.22
All this time you've suffered,

1649
01:42:33.22 --> 01:42:34.94
you've risked your body and soul on a man

1650
01:42:34.94 --> 01:42:37.30
who loves his sword more than he loves you.

1651
01:42:38.14 --> 01:42:40.30
I'll die to vindicate my sword,

1652
01:42:40.30 --> 01:42:43.06
but I wouldn't die for the love of a woman,

1653
01:42:43.06 --> 01:42:44.14
not even you.

1654
01:42:45.10 --> 01:42:47.06
As so much as I'd like to fall in my knees

1655
01:42:47.06 --> 01:42:50.06
and beg forgiveness, I can't.

1656
01:42:55.14 --> 01:42:57.46
Yeah, another speech.

1657
01:42:57.46 --> 01:43:00.94
Another scene that most women would rather not go through.

1658
01:43:00.94 --> 01:43:03.94
Yeah, and it's another, again,

1659
01:43:03.94 --> 01:43:06.58
I know I don't relate to every normal person

1660
01:43:06.58 --> 01:43:08.54
at all in very little ways,

1661
01:43:08.54 --> 01:43:09.70
but like when I read that,

1662
01:43:09.70 --> 01:43:12.10
I'm always like, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

1663
01:43:12.10 --> 01:43:15.10
And I'm in married for 20 years to an awesome woman.

1664
01:43:15.10 --> 01:43:18.34
And, but yeah, when I hear that, I just think, yeah,

1665
01:43:18.34 --> 01:43:20.34
that's how you do it, right?

1666
01:43:20.34 --> 01:43:22.98
Hey, look, every time I would think about you,

1667
01:43:22.98 --> 01:43:25.78
I just look at my rifle and be the, I'm good.

1668
01:43:25.78 --> 01:43:30.30
I wanna chime in with another one that is not chronologically.

1669
01:43:30.30 --> 01:43:32.82
Yes, sorry, we're out of sync.

1670
01:43:32.82 --> 01:43:35.06
Oh, it's okay, but the ones that I underlined

1671
01:43:35.06 --> 01:43:37.82
tend to be universally.

1672
01:43:37.82 --> 01:43:41.74
I think universally applicable in some ways, yeah.

1673
01:43:41.74 --> 01:43:45.86
So to the fore, this is apparently a discussion

1674
01:43:45.86 --> 01:43:48.62
about some type of battle,

1675
01:43:48.62 --> 01:43:50.38
and they're going back and forth.

1676
01:43:54.70 --> 01:43:56.26
All right, so this is Musashi.

1677
01:43:57.38 --> 01:43:59.46
Then what else can I do, but challenge him?

1678
01:43:59.46 --> 01:44:01.34
I realize, of course, that even if I do,

1679
01:44:01.34 --> 01:44:03.42
he'll probably refuse to come out of retirement,

1680
01:44:03.42 --> 01:44:06.50
so I'm challenging this whole castle to a battle instead.

1681
01:44:06.50 --> 01:44:09.74
A battle, of course, the fore.

1682
01:44:10.98 --> 01:44:13.06
And then, here we go.

1683
01:44:13.06 --> 01:44:16.54
So his arms still held by Kazimone and Debutchi.

1684
01:44:16.54 --> 01:44:18.06
Musashi looked up at the sky.

1685
01:44:18.06 --> 01:44:19.34
There was a flapping sound,

1686
01:44:19.34 --> 01:44:20.78
as an eagle flew towards them

1687
01:44:20.78 --> 01:44:23.62
from the blackness involving Mount Kassagi.

1688
01:44:23.62 --> 01:44:25.64
Like a giant shroud, it's silhouette,

1689
01:44:25.64 --> 01:44:27.94
hid the stars from view before it glided,

1690
01:44:27.94 --> 01:44:30.38
noisely down to the roof of the rice storehouse.

1691
01:44:30.38 --> 01:44:32.90
And then this is the part that I highlighted.

1692
01:44:32.90 --> 01:44:35.18
To the four retainers, the word battle,

1693
01:44:35.18 --> 01:44:38.30
sounded so melodramatic as to be laughable,

1694
01:44:38.30 --> 01:44:40.38
but to Musashi, it barely suffice

1695
01:44:40.38 --> 01:44:43.30
to express his concept of what was to come.

1696
01:44:43.30 --> 01:44:45.10
Ha ha ha ha.

1697
01:44:46.30 --> 01:44:48.42
Yes, yes.

1698
01:44:49.46 --> 01:44:52.58
This part, so Musashi said had this,

1699
01:44:52.58 --> 01:44:57.42
another clan, another group that he's been battling with.

1700
01:44:57.42 --> 01:45:01.54
And the senior guy in the family,

1701
01:45:01.54 --> 01:45:03.86
the senior guy from the school died,

1702
01:45:03.86 --> 01:45:05.06
or isn't, yeah,

1703
01:45:05.06 --> 01:45:06.34
he's died.

1704
01:45:06.34 --> 01:45:08.86
And this 13 year old boy is now the senior guy

1705
01:45:08.86 --> 01:45:10.90
and the family, his name is again Jiro.

1706
01:45:12.34 --> 01:45:14.22
And he shows up.

1707
01:45:14.22 --> 01:45:15.14
So he's challenged as well.

1708
01:45:15.14 --> 01:45:17.42
Again, he challenges all these people to fight,

1709
01:45:17.42 --> 01:45:19.30
and he shows up and they show up.

1710
01:45:19.30 --> 01:45:21.58
And he gets there, it's by some tree.

1711
01:45:23.14 --> 01:45:24.26
And of course, it starts off.

1712
01:45:24.26 --> 01:45:25.58
Musashi, you're late.

1713
01:45:25.58 --> 01:45:26.62
Try to horse first.

1714
01:45:26.62 --> 01:45:27.98
Try to horse voice.

1715
01:45:27.98 --> 01:45:29.98
Took a shit on my dinner table.

1716
01:45:29.98 --> 01:45:33.14
Many took encouragement from Musashi's declaration

1717
01:45:33.14 --> 01:45:35.54
that he was alone.

1718
01:45:35.54 --> 01:45:37.06
Believe me, it was a trick.

1719
01:45:37.06 --> 01:45:39.82
They started looking around for phantom seconds.

1720
01:45:39.82 --> 01:45:41.94
A loud twang off to one side,

1721
01:45:41.94 --> 01:45:45.38
a loud was followed, a split second later,

1722
01:45:45.38 --> 01:45:48.38
by the glint of Musashi's sword flashing through the air.

1723
01:45:49.38 --> 01:45:50.74
Oh, someone shot an air out of him.

1724
01:45:50.74 --> 01:45:53.30
The arrow aimed at his face broke.

1725
01:45:53.30 --> 01:45:56.74
Half falling behind his shoulder, the other half.

1726
01:45:56.74 --> 01:45:59.78
The other half near the tip of his lowered sword.

1727
01:45:59.78 --> 01:46:03.42
A rather where his sword had just been.

1728
01:46:03.42 --> 01:46:06.02
From Musashi was already on the move.

1729
01:46:06.02 --> 01:46:08.30
His hair bristling like a lion's mane.

1730
01:46:08.30 --> 01:46:11.50
He was bounding toward the shadowy form

1731
01:46:11.50 --> 01:46:13.50
behind the spreading pine.

1732
01:46:13.50 --> 01:46:18.30
Gingiro hugged the tree trunk, screaming help.

1733
01:46:18.30 --> 01:46:19.50
I'm scared.

1734
01:46:19.50 --> 01:46:24.74
Gazeimon jumped forward, howling as though the blow had struck him,

1735
01:46:24.74 --> 01:46:25.94
but it was too late.

1736
01:46:25.94 --> 01:46:29.38
Musashi's sword sliced to two foot strip

1737
01:46:29.38 --> 01:46:31.78
of bark off the trunk.

1738
01:46:31.78 --> 01:46:36.38
It fell to the ground by Kingiro's blood covered head.

1739
01:46:37.18 --> 01:46:40.50
It was the act of a ferocious demon, Musashi,

1740
01:46:40.50 --> 01:46:44.50
ignoring the others, had made straight for the boy.

1741
01:46:45.62 --> 01:46:49.78
And it seemed he had had this in mind from the beginning.

1742
01:46:50.70 --> 01:46:54.46
The assault was of a savagery beyond conception.

1743
01:46:54.46 --> 01:46:56.62
Kingiro's death did not reduce the Yoshi,

1744
01:46:56.62 --> 01:47:00.94
because Yoshioka's fighting capacity in the slightest

1745
01:47:00.94 --> 01:47:03.50
would have been nervous excitement rose to a level

1746
01:47:03.50 --> 01:47:05.46
of mergers frenzy.

1747
01:47:07.58 --> 01:47:09.18
And so that's how he kicks off the battle.

1748
01:47:09.18 --> 01:47:11.86
There's the 13 year old boy and he goes right for him

1749
01:47:11.86 --> 01:47:13.30
and cuts off his head.

1750
01:47:15.66 --> 01:47:20.66
So, and this is the first time he starts using both swords.

1751
01:47:21.54 --> 01:47:23.22
I think this is the first time onlookers

1752
01:47:23.22 --> 01:47:25.70
who had a clear view of him covered their eyes in horror.

1753
01:47:25.70 --> 01:47:27.70
This is as this battle continues.

1754
01:47:27.70 --> 01:47:30.66
Most more ghastly still was the sight of the dead

1755
01:47:30.66 --> 01:47:32.26
and wounded left than his wake.

1756
01:47:32.26 --> 01:47:34.86
As he continued his tactical retreat up the path,

1757
01:47:34.86 --> 01:47:36.54
he reached a patch of open land

1758
01:47:36.54 --> 01:47:39.34
where his pursuers served forward in a mass attack.

1759
01:47:39.34 --> 01:47:42.94
In a matter of seconds, four or five of men had been cut down.

1760
01:47:42.94 --> 01:47:44.98
They lay scattered over a wide area,

1761
01:47:44.98 --> 01:47:46.70
more a bon test to mone to the speed

1762
01:47:46.70 --> 01:47:49.14
with which Musashi struck and moved on.

1763
01:47:49.14 --> 01:47:51.38
He seemed to be everywhere at once.

1764
01:47:51.38 --> 01:47:53.74
But for all his agile shifts and dodges,

1765
01:47:53.74 --> 01:47:56.26
Musashi clung to one basic strategy.

1766
01:47:56.26 --> 01:47:59.46
He never attacked a group from the front or the side,

1767
01:47:59.46 --> 01:48:02.78
always obliquely at an exposed corner.

1768
01:48:02.78 --> 01:48:05.50
Whenever a battery of samurai approached him head on,

1769
01:48:05.50 --> 01:48:07.74
he somehow contrived to shift like lightning

1770
01:48:07.74 --> 01:48:09.90
to a corner of their formation

1771
01:48:09.90 --> 01:48:14.14
from which he could confront only one or two of them at a time.

1772
01:48:14.14 --> 01:48:16.54
In this way, he managed to keep them essentially

1773
01:48:16.54 --> 01:48:18.38
in the same position.

1774
01:48:18.38 --> 01:48:21.74
But eventually Musashi was bound to be worn down.

1775
01:48:21.74 --> 01:48:24.06
Eventually, too, his opponent seemed to be

1776
01:48:24.06 --> 01:48:26.78
seemed bound to find a way to thwart his method of attack.

1777
01:48:26.78 --> 01:48:29.22
To do this, they would need to form themselves

1778
01:48:29.22 --> 01:48:33.02
into two large forces before and behind him.

1779
01:48:33.02 --> 01:48:36.10
Then he would be in even greater danger.

1780
01:48:37.26 --> 01:48:39.54
It took all Musashi's resourcefulness

1781
01:48:39.54 --> 01:48:41.86
to stop that from happening.

1782
01:48:41.86 --> 01:48:44.74
At some point, Musashi drew his smaller sword

1783
01:48:44.74 --> 01:48:47.42
and started to fight with both hands.

1784
01:48:47.42 --> 01:48:48.94
While the large sword and his right hand

1785
01:48:48.94 --> 01:48:51.06
was smeared with blood up to the hilt

1786
01:48:51.06 --> 01:48:53.02
and the fist that held at the small sword

1787
01:48:53.02 --> 01:48:54.78
and his left hand was clean.

1788
01:48:54.78 --> 01:48:57.14
And though it picked up a bit of flesh,

1789
01:48:57.14 --> 01:49:00.14
the first time it was used, it continued to sparkle,

1790
01:49:00.14 --> 01:49:02.10
greedy for blood.

1791
01:49:02.10 --> 01:49:04.02
Musashi himself was not fully aware

1792
01:49:04.02 --> 01:49:06.58
that he had drawn it, even though he was wielding it

1793
01:49:06.58 --> 01:49:09.86
with the same deafness as the larger sword.

1794
01:49:11.22 --> 01:49:14.66
So he's just getting after it with two swords.

1795
01:49:14.66 --> 01:49:17.94
And eventually, Ron crowd cried a thousand voices,

1796
01:49:17.94 --> 01:49:20.94
you fighting by yourself, Ron, Ron, while you can.

1797
01:49:20.94 --> 01:49:22.94
So he just crushes everyone.

1798
01:49:22.94 --> 01:49:26.70
There's another weapon that I don't know if they

1799
01:49:26.70 --> 01:49:30.22
talk about in this book that he was quite a depth

1800
01:49:30.22 --> 01:49:33.02
that using as I understand it before,

1801
01:49:33.02 --> 01:49:35.02
he began fighting with two swords.

1802
01:49:35.02 --> 01:49:38.22
And it goes by a number of different names

1803
01:49:38.22 --> 01:49:41.98
and English, sometimes it's called the Jat or Jati,

1804
01:49:41.98 --> 01:49:43.82
J-U-T-T-E in Japanese.

1805
01:49:43.82 --> 01:49:48.62
It's Jite means 10 hands literally.

1806
01:49:48.62 --> 01:49:52.94
And it was a baton, basically.

1807
01:49:52.94 --> 01:49:57.66
If you could imagine, this will make sense in a moment.

1808
01:49:57.66 --> 01:50:02.66
If you could imagine a half-inch thick iron rod

1809
01:50:02.66 --> 01:50:05.86
that's about 18 inches long or 12 inches long,

1810
01:50:05.86 --> 01:50:09.54
that then has what looks like the clip of a,

1811
01:50:09.54 --> 01:50:13.58
say, ballpoint pen, that is a little,

1812
01:50:13.58 --> 01:50:19.94
that is pulled away from that rod,

1813
01:50:19.94 --> 01:50:24.02
so that you have a space in between this hook effectively

1814
01:50:24.02 --> 01:50:25.54
and the rod.

1815
01:50:25.54 --> 01:50:29.18
Palisguards and so on would use these as,

1816
01:50:29.18 --> 01:50:30.98
the equivalent of a police badge

1817
01:50:30.98 --> 01:50:35.18
because they were forbidden from having swords in certain quarters

1818
01:50:35.18 --> 01:50:37.58
because they could be used to assassinate

1819
01:50:37.58 --> 01:50:40.78
higher ranking officials and so on.

1820
01:50:40.78 --> 01:50:45.18
And you could use that in combination with a sword

1821
01:50:45.18 --> 01:50:51.18
to effectively parry or catch the blade

1822
01:50:51.18 --> 01:50:54.18
in between those two prongs and then twisted away.

1823
01:50:54.18 --> 01:50:57.02
And then twisted away or just use it to temporarily

1824
01:50:57.02 --> 01:50:58.78
arrest the use of that blade

1825
01:50:58.78 --> 01:51:02.98
and then pull your own long sword and cut someone down.

1826
01:51:02.98 --> 01:51:06.02
And Musashi was very adept as I understand it

1827
01:51:06.02 --> 01:51:11.02
using the G-Dead before he started using two swords.

1828
01:51:11.02 --> 01:51:12.26
You could also just use the G-Dead

1829
01:51:12.26 --> 01:51:15.06
like club-seminated, and it's a big,

1830
01:51:15.06 --> 01:51:18.94
which I'm sure is exactly what it was used for.

1831
01:51:18.94 --> 01:51:22.98
Now, as the story progresses, he matures

1832
01:51:22.98 --> 01:51:26.42
and starts moving into a little bit of a different phase

1833
01:51:26.42 --> 01:51:29.10
and this is kind of where the first time he starts,

1834
01:51:29.10 --> 01:51:31.54
he's wounded and he's traveling

1835
01:51:31.54 --> 01:51:33.90
and eventually he lays up for the night.

1836
01:51:33.90 --> 01:51:37.26
After the incident, Musashi went to his room

1837
01:51:37.26 --> 01:51:39.94
where he lay awake in the dark as eyes glistening.

1838
01:51:39.94 --> 01:51:43.34
The way of the samurai, he concentrated on this concept

1839
01:51:43.34 --> 01:51:46.34
as it applied to himself and to his sword.

1840
01:51:46.34 --> 01:51:48.22
Suddenly he saw the truth.

1841
01:51:48.22 --> 01:51:52.10
The techniques of a swordsman were not his goal.

1842
01:51:52.10 --> 01:51:55.06
He saw the all embracing way of the sword.

1843
01:51:55.06 --> 01:51:59.38
The sword was to be far more than a simple weapon.

1844
01:51:59.38 --> 01:52:03.42
It had to be an answer to life's questions.

1845
01:52:03.42 --> 01:52:07.42
The way of Usugi Kenshin and Date Mons,

1846
01:52:07.42 --> 01:52:12.42
Musuname was two narrowly military, two hidebound.

1847
01:52:14.42 --> 01:52:19.02
It would be up to him to add to it its human aspect,

1848
01:52:19.02 --> 01:52:23.42
to give it greater profundity, greater loftiness.

1849
01:52:23.42 --> 01:52:26.54
For the first time, he asked whether it was possible

1850
01:52:26.54 --> 01:52:32.86
for an insignificant human to become one with the universe.

1851
01:52:32.86 --> 01:52:37.86
He started to, like I said, mature, do you got one?

1852
01:52:37.86 --> 01:52:42.86
Yeah, I have one which I think is philosophically very similar

1853
01:52:42.86 --> 01:52:46.86
and brings back one of the characters that you read about earlier.

1854
01:52:46.86 --> 01:52:50.86
And I refers to a lesson that he learns from,

1855
01:52:50.86 --> 01:52:52.86
or head learn from Takawan.

1856
01:52:52.86 --> 01:52:54.86
And here's how it goes.

1857
01:52:54.86 --> 01:52:57.86
It wasn't that he, that's Musashi, had forgotten the lesson,

1858
01:52:57.86 --> 01:53:00.86
Takawan had taught him the truly in that is.

1859
01:53:00.86 --> 01:53:03.86
The truly brave man is one who loves life,

1860
01:53:03.86 --> 01:53:07.86
cherishing it as a treasure that once forfeited can never be recovered.

1861
01:53:07.86 --> 01:53:11.86
He well knew that to live was more than to merely survive.

1862
01:53:11.86 --> 01:53:13.86
That's the one that I highlighted.

1863
01:53:13.86 --> 01:53:16.86
The problem was how to imbue this life with meaning,

1864
01:53:16.86 --> 01:53:21.86
how to ensure that his day would cast a bright ray of light

1865
01:53:21.86 --> 01:53:25.86
into the future, even if it became necessary to give up that life for a cause.

1866
01:53:25.86 --> 01:53:29.86
If he succeeded in doing this, the length of his life,

1867
01:53:29.86 --> 01:53:32.86
20 years or 70 made little difference.

1868
01:53:32.86 --> 01:53:37.86
A lifetime was only an insignificant interval in the endless flow of time.

1869
01:53:37.86 --> 01:53:40.86
I think I've heard you say that quote before.

1870
01:53:40.86 --> 01:53:44.86
I'm not just surviving, living is not surviving.

1871
01:53:44.86 --> 01:53:46.86
That's kind of wild, maybe this is where I got, maybe this is where I got.

1872
01:53:46.86 --> 01:53:50.86
I don't think I've heard you say the quote, but I think I've heard you say that concept before.

1873
01:53:50.86 --> 01:53:51.86
Yeah, I have.

1874
01:53:51.86 --> 01:53:54.86
And maybe I mean, this is where it accepted me 20 years ago,

1875
01:53:54.86 --> 01:53:59.86
and I'm just asking. He ends up with a guy named E.O.

1876
01:53:59.86 --> 01:54:02.86
who's sort of a student of his.

1877
01:54:02.86 --> 01:54:04.86
And they're living in the mountains.

1878
01:54:04.86 --> 01:54:10.86
And again, I think this is as, as he's starting to mature and grow

1879
01:54:10.86 --> 01:54:13.86
in this area where he's going to, where he is.

1880
01:54:13.86 --> 01:54:15.86
It's a mountainous area in Japan.

1881
01:54:15.86 --> 01:54:17.86
And from those of you that haven't been in Japan,

1882
01:54:17.86 --> 01:54:21.86
it's got some incredibly beautiful mountains and incredible.

1883
01:54:21.86 --> 01:54:22.86
Yeah, beautiful.

1884
01:54:22.86 --> 01:54:26.86
Even right outside of Tokyo for people who are ever thinking of going,

1885
01:54:26.86 --> 01:54:30.86
there's a place called Niko, which is N.I.K.K.O in the O's Long.

1886
01:54:30.86 --> 01:54:35.86
Niko and it'd be beautiful, temples and mountains.

1887
01:54:35.86 --> 01:54:37.86
That is where I did the Japanese horseback archery.

1888
01:54:37.86 --> 01:54:41.86
Just as a side note on the Japanese horseback archery, it was so great.

1889
01:54:41.86 --> 01:54:45.86
So there are not, as you would imagine, many schools for horseback archery.

1890
01:54:45.86 --> 01:54:50.86
But one of the, one of the families, one of the clans that still exists,

1891
01:54:50.86 --> 01:54:54.86
the O'Gasawa, so the O'Gasawa does the family and then, or do you,

1892
01:54:54.86 --> 01:54:56.86
like, RYU is the school.

1893
01:54:56.86 --> 01:55:00.86
And that, that, that, do comes up a lot in Wisaashi's life.

1894
01:55:00.86 --> 01:55:02.86
If you look at the history, it's like such and such,

1895
01:55:02.86 --> 01:55:06.86
do you, such and such, do you like the, the school of whatever.

1896
01:55:06.86 --> 01:55:10.86
And O'Gasawa, or do Japanese horseback archery

1897
01:55:10.86 --> 01:55:16.86
is what I ended up studying with one of the members of the O'Gasawa family.

1898
01:55:16.86 --> 01:55:19.86
And we did it in Niko, which is a stunning place to train.

1899
01:55:19.86 --> 01:55:25.86
And just as a little, a little bit of context on what exactly this means.

1900
01:55:25.86 --> 01:55:33.86
So the ceremonial version of Japanese horseback archery entails a straight away

1901
01:55:33.86 --> 01:55:40.86
that is marked off in, in, in my case, with metal rods like rebar.

1902
01:55:40.86 --> 01:55:46.86
So you effectively have these stakes in the ground that are about three feet high of rebar.

1903
01:55:46.86 --> 01:55:52.86
Like every five feet, two parallel lines running, let's call it 300 or 500 feet.

1904
01:55:52.86 --> 01:55:56.86
And you get on a horse at the very beginning of this track.

1905
01:55:56.86 --> 01:56:02.86
And there are three targets laid out equally distance over that 500 foot space.

1906
01:56:02.86 --> 01:56:06.86
And the first one probably comes up at about a hundred meters.

1907
01:56:06.86 --> 01:56:10.86
And there are about the size of a big dinner plate.

1908
01:56:10.86 --> 01:56:12.86
And you're on the horse.

1909
01:56:12.86 --> 01:56:14.86
The saddle is wood, so you don't sit on it.

1910
01:56:14.86 --> 01:56:17.86
You do, you squat above it.

1911
01:56:17.86 --> 01:56:21.86
And you have tabby on which these split socks, you don't have shoes on.

1912
01:56:21.86 --> 01:56:27.86
In these stirrups that actually do not enclose the foot around the foot.

1913
01:56:27.86 --> 01:56:28.86
They don't encircle the foot.

1914
01:56:28.86 --> 01:56:31.86
You stick it in kind of like a slipper.

1915
01:56:31.86 --> 01:56:35.86
And you have a really wide stance.

1916
01:56:35.86 --> 01:56:38.86
And then you have a bow, which is about six feet long.

1917
01:56:38.86 --> 01:56:40.86
In my case, in my left hand.

1918
01:56:40.86 --> 01:56:44.86
And the bottom of the bow, you keep inside your thigh.

1919
01:56:44.86 --> 01:56:48.86
And then you have arrows that are stuck into your belt on your lower back.

1920
01:56:48.86 --> 01:56:50.86
And your first arrow is knocked.

1921
01:56:50.86 --> 01:56:58.86
And then you pull the lines slightly and lock it down with your index fingers so that there's tension on it.

1922
01:56:58.86 --> 01:57:00.86
And then you have the reins.

1923
01:57:00.86 --> 01:57:02.86
And you take off at a full gallop.

1924
01:57:02.86 --> 01:57:04.86
And then you throw the reins down.

1925
01:57:04.86 --> 01:57:05.86
And you fly it.

1926
01:57:05.86 --> 01:57:08.86
You gallop with no control of the horse.

1927
01:57:08.86 --> 01:57:11.86
And these rebar that are set every five feet.

1928
01:57:11.86 --> 01:57:13.86
Keep the horse galloping in a straight direction.

1929
01:57:13.86 --> 01:57:15.86
And you fire the first arrow at the first target.

1930
01:57:15.86 --> 01:57:19.86
And then you have to reload your arrow by reaching to your back, pulling the arrow out.

1931
01:57:19.86 --> 01:57:27.86
And there's a really technical, somewhat complicated way of knocking the arrow very, very quickly while you're riding a horse.

1932
01:57:27.86 --> 01:57:32.86
And then you intend to hit the next two targets.

1933
01:57:32.86 --> 01:57:36.86
While you're yelling, there's certain things you're supposed to yell as you shoot at your target.

1934
01:57:36.86 --> 01:57:42.86
And it's, it's an incredible, incredible demonstration.

1935
01:57:42.86 --> 01:57:52.86
And they do this at the temples in Nekol, which, to me is what comes to mind in terms of imagery when we're talking about his experience in these mountainous regions.

1936
01:57:52.86 --> 01:57:57.86
And yeah, lesson number one, or you do not want to fall off.

1937
01:57:57.86 --> 01:58:04.86
And people do fall off because if you fall off your horse, you get trampled by the horse and you hit the rebar.

1938
01:58:04.86 --> 01:58:18.86
But the reason I brought this up is that everyone is seeing restaurants say that say it's established in 1946 established 1987 established whatever.

1939
01:58:18.86 --> 01:58:23.86
And the sun, a pretty young guy in his mid 30s, really strong.

1940
01:58:23.86 --> 01:58:33.86
The bow eye shot had maybe at a 60 pound or 65 pound tension, which is surprisingly difficult for people who have not done much archery to hold that at full extension for a period of time.

1941
01:58:33.86 --> 01:58:37.86
Especially in a horse.

1942
01:58:37.86 --> 01:58:43.86
It's like 65 is 70 pounds is quite legit on a long bow or a recirf bow.

1943
01:58:43.86 --> 01:58:48.86
And he was pulling a bow that was 120 pounds, like nothing.

1944
01:58:48.86 --> 01:58:55.86
And his jacket, he had what might look like sort of a shiny, like,

1945
01:58:55.86 --> 01:59:04.86
like, like, break dancing jacket is kind of what it looked like with like the elastic tube portions on the wrists.

1946
01:59:04.86 --> 01:59:07.86
And on the back it said,

1947
01:59:07.86 --> 01:59:12.86
Ogasa, Oda, Yabusa, me established 1157.

1948
01:59:12.86 --> 01:59:16.86
Let's just like, yeah, this goes back away.

1949
01:59:16.86 --> 01:59:17.86
Did you hit the targets?

1950
01:59:17.86 --> 01:59:19.86
At the very end, I did, yeah.

1951
01:59:19.86 --> 01:59:20.86
You got him.

1952
01:59:20.86 --> 01:59:23.86
Because you know, shooting from vehicles is really is really hard.

1953
01:59:23.86 --> 01:59:25.86
Shooting guns from vehicles. I mean, it's just hard.

1954
01:59:25.86 --> 01:59:31.86
I can't imagine trying to do a bow or arrow on horseback on a wooden saddle.

1955
01:59:31.86 --> 01:59:34.86
Yeah, it's definitely a different thing.

1956
01:59:34.86 --> 01:59:38.86
I was very surprised that I actually ended up hitting the targets, but, yeah, at the very end.

1957
01:59:38.86 --> 01:59:41.86
How long did you train it for?

1958
01:59:41.86 --> 01:59:44.86
Another thing I would not recommend.

1959
01:59:44.86 --> 01:59:46.86
I crammed it into a week.

1960
01:59:46.86 --> 01:59:48.86
I had a week to train.

1961
01:59:48.86 --> 01:59:49.86
Did you know how to ride a horse before?

1962
01:59:49.86 --> 01:59:53.86
I had some experience on a horse, but western.

1963
01:59:53.86 --> 01:59:57.86
And western style for people don't know.

1964
01:59:57.86 --> 02:00:02.86
If you think rodeo, where you're effectively seated in the saddle,

1965
02:00:02.86 --> 02:00:05.86
it's kind of like the Harley Davidson of horse riding.

1966
02:00:05.86 --> 02:00:08.86
Like your feet are out in front of you, you hear your heels are dropped.

1967
02:00:08.86 --> 02:00:09.86
You don't post.

1968
02:00:09.86 --> 02:00:16.86
And Japanese is somewhere between, it's closer to English,

1969
02:00:16.86 --> 02:00:19.86
where you'd be more elevated.

1970
02:00:19.86 --> 02:00:22.86
And the position is very, very different.

1971
02:00:22.86 --> 02:00:25.86
You're effectively almost a solo stance.

1972
02:00:25.86 --> 02:00:28.86
Like you're very much abducted.

1973
02:00:28.86 --> 02:00:31.86
Like your groin is very, very open.

1974
02:00:31.86 --> 02:00:33.86
So I was extremely sorry.

1975
02:00:33.86 --> 02:00:37.86
I felt like I was doing like suspended squat practice for hours every day.

1976
02:00:37.86 --> 02:00:39.86
So after a few days of that,

1977
02:00:39.86 --> 02:00:40.86
pretty uncomfortable.

1978
02:00:40.86 --> 02:00:43.86
And we lost three days.

1979
02:00:43.86 --> 02:00:44.86
I want to say to rain.

1980
02:00:44.86 --> 02:00:48.86
We couldn't. We couldn't. We had two dangers for the horses and the humans

1981
02:00:48.86 --> 02:00:51.86
to train doing anything in those conditions.

1982
02:00:51.86 --> 02:00:55.86
So we had about four, I'd say four days of real training.

1983
02:00:55.86 --> 02:00:58.86
So speaking of rain, they're up there.

1984
02:00:58.86 --> 02:01:03.86
Musashi and Eori are up there.

1985
02:01:03.86 --> 02:01:05.86
Well, here we go into the book.

1986
02:01:05.86 --> 02:01:08.86
As autumn waned, the insect voice is faded into silence.

1987
02:01:08.86 --> 02:01:10.86
Weaves withered and fell.

1988
02:01:10.86 --> 02:01:13.86
Musashi and Eori finish their cabin because they built a cabin.

1989
02:01:13.86 --> 02:01:17.86
And dressed themselves the task of making the land ready for planting.

1990
02:01:17.86 --> 02:01:18.86
One day while surveying the land,

1991
02:01:18.86 --> 02:01:24.86
Musashi seldom found himself thinking it was like a diagram of the social unrest that lasted for a century after the owned in war.

1992
02:01:24.86 --> 02:01:28.86
Such thoughts aside, it was not an encouraging picture.

1993
02:01:28.86 --> 02:01:30.86
Unknown to Musashi.

1994
02:01:30.86 --> 02:01:38.86
Hot to hot hot and gahara had over the centuries been buried many times by volcanic ash from Mount Fuji.

1995
02:01:38.86 --> 02:01:42.86
And the tone river had repeatedly flooded the flatlands.

1996
02:01:42.86 --> 02:01:46.86
Whenever when the weather was fair and the land bone dry.

1997
02:01:46.86 --> 02:01:51.86
But whenever there was heavy rains, the water carved out new channels.

1998
02:01:51.86 --> 02:01:54.86
Caaring great quantities of dirt and rock along with it.

1999
02:01:54.86 --> 02:01:58.86
There was no principal stream into which smaller ones flow naturally.

2000
02:01:58.86 --> 02:02:03.86
The nearest thing to this being a wide base in that lock sufficiently.

2001
02:02:03.86 --> 02:02:09.86
Sufficient capacity or does our lack of sufficient capacity to either water or drain the area as a whole.

2002
02:02:09.86 --> 02:02:13.86
The most urgent need was obvious to bring the water under control.

2003
02:02:13.86 --> 02:02:15.86
So it's got this big piece of land.

2004
02:02:15.86 --> 02:02:17.86
And he thinks our camera turned us into a farm.

2005
02:02:17.86 --> 02:02:22.86
He doesn't really know that there's no pathway for the streams.

2006
02:02:22.86 --> 02:02:24.86
When the water comes down out of the mountains and when it rains,

2007
02:02:24.86 --> 02:02:26.86
he doesn't know that there's nowhere for it to go.

2008
02:02:26.86 --> 02:02:27.86
It doesn't make sense to the water.

2009
02:02:27.86 --> 02:02:30.86
So it just kind of floods everything.

2010
02:02:30.86 --> 02:02:36.86
Still the more he looked, the more he had questioned why the area was undeveloped.

2011
02:02:36.86 --> 02:02:39.86
They won't be easy, thought, excited by the challenge posed,

2012
02:02:39.86 --> 02:02:46.86
joining the water and earth to create productive fields was not much different than leading men and women in such a way that civilization might bloom.

2013
02:02:46.86 --> 02:02:52.86
To Mousashi, it seemed that his goal was in complete agreement with his ideals of swordsmanship.

2014
02:02:52.86 --> 02:02:56.86
He had come to see the way of the sword in a new light.

2015
02:02:56.86 --> 02:03:01.86
A year or two earlier, he had wanted only to conquer all rivals.

2016
02:03:01.86 --> 02:03:07.86
But now the idea that the sword existed for the purpose of giving him power over other people was unsatisfying.

2017
02:03:07.86 --> 02:03:14.86
To cut people down, to try and over them, to display the limits of one strength seemed increasingly vain.

2018
02:03:14.86 --> 02:03:22.86
He wanted to conquer himself, to make life itself submit to him, to cause people to live rather than die.

2019
02:03:22.86 --> 02:03:27.86
The way of the sword should not be used merely for his own perfection.

2020
02:03:27.86 --> 02:03:34.86
It should be a source of strength for governing people and leading them to peace and happiness.

2021
02:03:34.86 --> 02:03:42.86
He realized his grand ideals were no more than dreams and would remain so as long as he lacked the political authority to implement them.

2022
02:03:42.86 --> 02:03:47.86
But here in this wasteland, he needed neither rank nor power.

2023
02:03:47.86 --> 02:03:51.86
He plunged into the struggle with joy and enthusiasm.

2024
02:03:51.86 --> 02:03:59.86
Day in and day out, stumps were uprooted, gravel sifted, land, level, soil, and rocks made into dikes.

2025
02:03:59.86 --> 02:04:06.86
Musashi and Eori worked from before dawn until after the stars were shining bright in the sky.

2026
02:04:06.86 --> 02:04:10.86
Now, as he's doing this, the villagers keep coming by.

2027
02:04:10.86 --> 02:04:12.86
And they say, what do they think they're doing in?

2028
02:04:12.86 --> 02:04:14.86
How do they think they can live in the place like that?

2029
02:04:14.86 --> 02:04:15.86
And you're wasting your time.

2030
02:04:15.86 --> 02:04:17.86
That's what the all the villagers are saying to them.

2031
02:04:17.86 --> 02:04:22.86
They've seen this for, you know, since 1100 or whatever they've seen this place get flooded.

2032
02:04:22.86 --> 02:04:26.86
And he keeps going, he keeps, you know, trying.

2033
02:04:26.86 --> 02:04:30.86
And every time he makes some progress, he, or it'll rain.

2034
02:04:30.86 --> 02:04:33.86
And everything gets washed away or it'll get flooded.

2035
02:04:33.86 --> 02:04:36.86
And then he thinks he's doing okay and it's a big snow in the mountains, everything survives.

2036
02:04:36.86 --> 02:04:40.86
But then it falls and everything, and then all the water comes down again.

2037
02:04:40.86 --> 02:04:45.86
So he goes on, he keeps working the land, he keeps trying to make it work.

2038
02:04:45.86 --> 02:04:51.86
Back to the book, Musashi carried on and his stubborn struggle throughout the winter into the second month of the new year.

2039
02:04:51.86 --> 02:04:59.86
It took several weeks of strenuous labor to dig ditches, drain the water off, piled dirt for a dike and then covered it with heavy rocks.

2040
02:04:59.86 --> 02:05:02.86
Three weeks later, everything was again washed away.

2041
02:05:02.86 --> 02:05:06.86
Look, Eori said, we're wasting our energy on something impossible.

2042
02:05:06.86 --> 02:05:08.86
Is that the way of the sword?

2043
02:05:08.86 --> 02:05:13.86
The question struck close to the bone, but Musashi would not give in.

2044
02:05:13.86 --> 02:05:16.86
Only a month passed before the next disaster.

2045
02:05:16.86 --> 02:05:25.86
A heavy snowfall followed by a quick fall, Eori, on his return trips from the temple for food inevitably wore a long face for the people there,

2046
02:05:25.86 --> 02:05:28.86
rode him mercilessly about Musashi's failure.

2047
02:05:28.86 --> 02:05:32.86
And finally, Musashi himself began to lose heart.

2048
02:05:32.86 --> 02:05:39.86
For two full days and on into a third, he sat silently brooding and staring at his field.

2049
02:05:39.86 --> 02:05:43.86
Then it dawned on him suddenly.

2050
02:05:43.86 --> 02:05:50.86
Unconsciously, he had been trying to create a neat, square field, like those common in other parts of the plain.

2051
02:05:50.86 --> 02:05:54.86
But this was not what the terrain called for.

2052
02:05:54.86 --> 02:06:03.86
Here, despite the general flatness, there were slight variations in the lay of the land and the quality of the soil that argued for an irregular shape.

2053
02:06:03.86 --> 02:06:14.86
What a fool I've been, he exclaimed aloud, I tried to make the water flow where I thought it should, and forced the dirt to stay where I thought it ought to be.

2054
02:06:14.86 --> 02:06:16.86
But it didn't work.

2055
02:06:16.86 --> 02:06:18.86
How could it?

2056
02:06:18.86 --> 02:06:22.86
Waters, water, dirt, dirt.

2057
02:06:22.86 --> 02:06:25.86
I can't change nature.

2058
02:06:25.86 --> 02:06:31.86
What I've got to do is learn to be a servant to the water and a protector of the land.

2059
02:06:31.86 --> 02:06:35.86
In his own way, he had submitted to the attitude of the peasants.

2060
02:06:35.86 --> 02:06:39.86
On that day, he became nature's man's servant.

2061
02:06:39.86 --> 02:06:44.86
He ceased trying to impose his will on nature and let nature lead the way.

2062
02:06:44.86 --> 02:06:51.86
While at the same time seeking out possibilities beyond the grasp of other inhabitants of the plain.

2063
02:06:51.86 --> 02:06:57.86
The snow came again, and another fall, the muddy water ooze slowly over the plain.

2064
02:06:57.86 --> 02:07:03.86
But Musashi had had time to work out his new approach and his field remained intact.

2065
02:07:03.86 --> 02:07:08.86
The same rules must apply to governing people he said to himself.

2066
02:07:08.86 --> 02:07:14.86
In his notebook, he wrote, do not attempt to oppose the way of the universe.

2067
02:07:14.86 --> 02:07:19.86
But first, make sure you know the way of the universe.

2068
02:07:19.86 --> 02:07:28.86
As I was telling one of my steel buddies about this, we were talking about that.

2069
02:07:28.86 --> 02:07:33.86
You can't, as a leader, a lot of times people want to change people.

2070
02:07:33.86 --> 02:07:35.86
You want to change them.

2071
02:07:35.86 --> 02:07:38.86
And you just, you can't change people.

2072
02:07:38.86 --> 02:07:42.86
You can shift them and they can change themselves.

2073
02:07:42.86 --> 02:07:47.86
But when you try to impose change on someone, you try to make someone what you want them to be,

2074
02:07:47.86 --> 02:07:50.86
it's very difficult to do, if not impossible.

2075
02:07:50.86 --> 02:07:54.86
I was talking about this one, had a guy in a seal platoon.

2076
02:07:54.86 --> 02:07:56.86
And he had potential, right?

2077
02:07:56.86 --> 02:07:58.86
But he had some flaws.

2078
02:07:58.86 --> 02:08:01.86
You know, he was a blout now from that kind of thing.

2079
02:08:01.86 --> 02:08:06.86
And just wanted to bring him along and try to everything.

2080
02:08:06.86 --> 02:08:14.86
Beatings, counselings, befriending, more beatings, did everything.

2081
02:08:14.86 --> 02:08:17.86
And you know, he would like to make slight adjustments for a little while.

2082
02:08:17.86 --> 02:08:19.86
And then he'd go back to just being the way he was.

2083
02:08:19.86 --> 02:08:22.86
And eventually I said, okay, well, we have to, that's the way he is.

2084
02:08:22.86 --> 02:08:24.86
That's the way this person is.

2085
02:08:24.86 --> 02:08:33.86
And you know, how do we work with him, so he's working within the confines of things that he can do and do them,

2086
02:08:33.86 --> 02:08:34.86
exceptively.

2087
02:08:34.86 --> 02:08:38.86
But I think people get caught on the idea that they're going to change people.

2088
02:08:38.86 --> 02:08:39.86
And it's really hard.

2089
02:08:39.86 --> 02:08:43.86
And you see this, especially with people getting involved in relationships with people that they think they're going to be able to change.

2090
02:08:43.86 --> 02:08:45.86
And you're not going to be able to do it.

2091
02:08:45.86 --> 02:08:47.86
I have a question for you, Jago.

2092
02:08:47.86 --> 02:09:04.86
In your own life experience, how do you separate the way of the universe, meaning in you personally, the things that are just you that you shouldn't try to change versus the things that you should try to improve.

2093
02:09:04.86 --> 02:09:09.86
Because I think that there's the temptation for a lot of people to say, well, that's just the way I am.

2094
02:09:09.86 --> 02:09:13.86
But it's it absolves them of the responsibility of doing the work.

2095
02:09:13.86 --> 02:09:16.86
I got asked a similar question and it'll tie into it.

2096
02:09:16.86 --> 02:09:22.86
But I guess by those working with the company the other day and a guy asked, you know, if I've got a guy that's really good at something,

2097
02:09:22.86 --> 02:09:27.86
but a person that's not really good should I just give up on trying to get the person that's not good at that job,

2098
02:09:27.86 --> 02:09:30.86
give up on them and just let the person that's good at it, do it.

2099
02:09:30.86 --> 02:09:38.86
And I said, well, yes, and no, I mean, if we have somebody that is a really good shot like he's a sniper.

2100
02:09:38.86 --> 02:09:40.86
But we got a guy that's not a good shot.

2101
02:09:40.86 --> 02:09:44.86
Okay, so we're going to give the sniper all the good missions and he's going to go do all the tough shots.

2102
02:09:44.86 --> 02:09:45.86
Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

2103
02:09:45.86 --> 02:09:48.86
That doesn't mean we just let the other guy never learn how to shoot.

2104
02:09:48.86 --> 02:09:51.86
No, we actually continue to train him and make him better.

2105
02:09:51.86 --> 02:09:55.86
And I think it's the same thing with your individual self, right?

2106
02:09:55.86 --> 02:10:01.86
If I've got weaknesses, I don't just say, well, I'm just going to avoid being in those areas where I'm weak.

2107
02:10:01.86 --> 02:10:04.86
I'm going to actually go and try and get better with them.

2108
02:10:04.86 --> 02:10:07.86
Now, I'm not going to make that the focus on my life, right?

2109
02:10:07.86 --> 02:10:11.86
I'm not going to try and become a ballerina, right?

2110
02:10:11.86 --> 02:10:14.86
What I like to be more flexible, absolutely.

2111
02:10:14.86 --> 02:10:16.86
Do I need to work on that? Absolutely.

2112
02:10:16.86 --> 02:10:18.86
But I'm not trying to become a ballerina.

2113
02:10:18.86 --> 02:10:26.86
I wouldn't focus on that because it would be a significant waste of my time and of my entire life in a very fruitless situation.

2114
02:10:26.86 --> 02:10:29.86
But that doesn't mean I shouldn't try and be more flexible, right?

2115
02:10:29.86 --> 02:10:34.86
So I think you, you still apply some time to try and improve it,

2116
02:10:34.86 --> 02:10:37.86
but you don't waste valuable energy.

2117
02:10:37.86 --> 02:10:43.86
You'd still look at what you're good at and say, you know, I'm better at doing jigsaw, I'm better at whatever.

2118
02:10:43.86 --> 02:10:53.86
Can I tell you one of the thoughts that for whatever reason consume my mind for about an hour and a half during my silent meditation retreat?

2119
02:10:53.86 --> 02:10:57.86
I was thinking about giraffe's can't dance.

2120
02:10:57.86 --> 02:11:03.86
This book, this demon slayer that crushes me on Amazon, always by five spots.

2121
02:11:03.86 --> 02:11:10.86
When I launch a book and I started thinking about how incredible it would be to take

2122
02:11:10.86 --> 02:11:22.86
Jaco, the cartoon character, as seen in the Jaco approved logo on your T and have a parody of that book called Jaco Cant Dance.

2123
02:11:22.86 --> 02:11:26.86
With like thought bubbles of what you're thinking throughout the book.

2124
02:11:26.86 --> 02:11:35.86
In any case, for whatever reason that is what my mind decided to settle on and I'm sorry.

2125
02:11:35.86 --> 02:11:38.86
So confession over confession.

2126
02:11:38.86 --> 02:11:44.86
So do you find that yourself that you say like, oh, I'm not good at this argument of void it or do you find yourself getting focused?

2127
02:11:44.86 --> 02:11:48.86
Because you know, you're talking about what Mousashi's, what they described Mousashi doing as earlier,

2128
02:11:48.86 --> 02:11:51.86
which is I only worry about things that are beating me, right?

2129
02:11:51.86 --> 02:11:53.86
I only worry about the opponent of the beat me.

2130
02:11:53.86 --> 02:11:59.86
I'm just like the only book you think about as this book, giraffe's can't dance, which is the one book that beats you because I know that's what you're focused on.

2131
02:11:59.86 --> 02:12:02.86
I can't worry about these other books that you can't be crap out of.

2132
02:12:02.86 --> 02:12:07.86
I also just like talking about it because I love the fact that it's called giraffe's can't dance.

2133
02:12:07.86 --> 02:12:09.86
Yeah, and it kicks your ass.

2134
02:12:09.86 --> 02:12:13.86
Do you think you get focused on things that are that you shouldn't be focused on?

2135
02:12:13.86 --> 02:12:15.86
Or that you're wasting time on?

2136
02:12:15.86 --> 02:12:32.86
I, you kind of know what you're good at. I do. I think that I've become better at working on or distinguishing between low level weaknesses and high level weaknesses.

2137
02:12:32.86 --> 02:12:40.86
And what I mean by that is if you imagine say, hey, people have seen like a champagne pyramid,

2138
02:12:40.86 --> 02:12:51.86
or sometimes built at weddings where you stack up all of these champagne glasses and you pour into one, or could be any type of glass, and it cascades down into the others.

2139
02:12:51.86 --> 02:12:57.86
Or you could think of it through a domino analogy. I use this analogy a lot looking at lead domino's like, what can I do?

2140
02:12:57.86 --> 02:13:05.86
If I have a task list, let's say, which of these five tasks will make all of the others easier or irrelevant?

2141
02:13:05.86 --> 02:13:08.86
And that'll help me sequence things in the right order.

2142
02:13:08.86 --> 02:13:17.86
So that I'm not wasting energy. If I've ten years of energy, I'd rather focus on identifying at least to begin with the lead domino's.

2143
02:13:17.86 --> 02:13:22.86
And so a high level weakness would be a lead domino.

2144
02:13:22.86 --> 02:13:31.86
Something that has downstream negative effects on many different areas, even that can compromise your strengths.

2145
02:13:31.86 --> 02:13:56.86
Right. So for me, for instance, I think for a very long time, I've viewed, I only viewed impatience through the lens of the benefits of aggression, because having a good offense has always been my model ever since I became fascinated by Dan Gable,

2146
02:13:56.86 --> 02:14:06.86
who is about as close to 100% offense, legendary wrestling competitor and coach.

2147
02:14:06.86 --> 02:14:14.86
And I have a lot of stories about Dan Gable, incredible, incredible guy, but I would have realized in the last few years, for instance, is that there are low level weaknesses.

2148
02:14:14.86 --> 02:14:26.86
Let's say, I am not a programmer. I am not good at ABCD or E skill that is more of a technician's craft.

2149
02:14:26.86 --> 02:14:31.86
I will not spend time on those things. If I can delegate it, we're out there.

2150
02:14:31.86 --> 02:14:50.86
If there are core psychological traits that are higher order that can negatively impact other things, then I've realized, for the long haul, I do want to at least experiment with developing those capacities.

2151
02:14:50.86 --> 02:15:06.86
What I think has helped me a lot is I'm always, and I was, when I was in the field teams, I was always looking at other people. I was always looking at their leadership. I was looking at what they're doing. I was looking at why they weren't getting along. I was looking at what was wrong with the cartoon.

2152
02:15:06.86 --> 02:15:18.86
And as I would sit there and watch these people, I would learn from them. I'd see two people that didn't get along. I'd say, why can't these guys get along? What's wrong with them? I'd watch them.

2153
02:15:18.86 --> 02:15:34.86
I'd see that this one guy has a giant ego. Oh, and so is the other guy. Instead of one of them disarming the other guys ego, they both can't figure that out. And so they're just battling. You got that inside of a seal between it's a horrible thing.

2154
02:15:34.86 --> 02:15:59.86
I could see to myself where I would see, oh, I've got frustrated with someone, I'd say, or I'd get, I'd have a negative thought about someone. I'd think, well, how do I have that negative thought about that person? That's actually a badass or it seems like a really strong personality or a strong presence. Why do I have that? Oh, I have that because that's my ego. And it's the same thing with when I see people getting excited.

2155
02:15:59.86 --> 02:16:08.86
I don't think excitement is usually a positive thing. I mean, it's not a negative thing, but sometimes people in a meeting, someone just immediately has an opinion.

2156
02:16:08.86 --> 02:16:22.86
And I think, and I watched their opinion fall apart because they didn't listen long enough. They didn't assess things long enough. And so I hear them state their opinion and they stayed it with vigor and with conviction.

2157
02:16:22.86 --> 02:16:34.86
And then you listen to it and all of a sudden they, they can't help but look bad because what they initially thought was wrong. And I probably had the same thoughts. I said to myself, I kept my mouth shut and I listened.

2158
02:16:34.86 --> 02:16:40.86
And so I'd see people do that and I'd say, you know what, when you're in a meeting and there's people talking about things, you don't need to say anything.

2159
02:16:40.86 --> 02:16:45.86
You don't need to appear stupid or whatever. It's a better do appear stupid than open your mouth and remove all doubt, right?

2160
02:16:45.86 --> 02:16:56.86
But I would learn these things about people which I think were helpful to me just by watching and seeing people and being really a really kind of a jerk in my own mind.

2161
02:16:56.86 --> 02:17:03.86
Like I watch people like a jerk like, why would you do that? What's wrong with you? Very accusatory tone in my own head.

2162
02:17:03.86 --> 02:17:10.86
But then it was really easy for me to flip that back on myself all the time and say, well wait a second, you do that too. Wait a second, you make that the same mistake.

2163
02:17:10.86 --> 02:17:28.86
But I think that from a psychological perspective, I think what's given me a good perspective of my own psychology is watching other people intently and closely with the goal of actually helping them correct that, of going up to the guy and say, hey man, this is your ego versus that guy's ego.

2164
02:17:28.86 --> 02:17:35.86
And you're either going to want to you who is going to have to disarm the other one or your guys are never going to go along and this never do you move forward.

2165
02:17:35.86 --> 02:17:54.86
And so I think that really helped me out a lot. I'm sure it did and I have found certainly that there are many benefits in my case of being a solo practitioner, so to speak, being unemployed, slash self employed for decades now.

2166
02:17:54.86 --> 02:18:08.86
But one of the clear downsides that I don't have that in person peer group to observe or superiors or subordinates to observe with the rare exception of a handful of employees now, but

2167
02:18:08.86 --> 02:18:26.86
the what I ended up doing for myself to try to improve because I didn't have I assumed and I think this is good for a lot of people do assume that you may not have sufficient self awareness to accurately self diagnose your weaknesses and strengths.

2168
02:18:26.86 --> 02:18:43.86
So I would seek out environments that made it very obvious and the way I did that and I think Musashi in a way, a ludes to this is if you say are on the battlefield.

2169
02:18:43.86 --> 02:18:58.86
In Musashi's case, your strengths and weaknesses or at least your weaknesses tend to become clearer or magnified. So if I could put myself into a really intense training environment like aka and San Jose.

2170
02:18:58.86 --> 02:19:14.86
I had a lot of professionals there at the time, came the last guys and a number of others and training with Dave and a handful of folks. I could watch my response to increasing levels of stress. How did I respond to extreme heat?

2171
02:19:14.86 --> 02:19:29.86
What was the self talk when I wanted to quit? Did I at what point was I inclined to try to find someone easy to roll with? Like how many rounds did it take, right?

2172
02:19:29.86 --> 02:19:47.86
I would note that and I would actually take notes. I bring my notebook and you can see I have notebooks everywhere here and I would note the not just the technical learnings and what I wanted to approve but the decisions and the self talk that I made that I want to approve upon.

2173
02:19:47.86 --> 02:20:01.86
I would like to try to identify the high level weaknesses that I could work on because everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

2174
02:20:01.86 --> 02:20:11.86
It's all great and theoretically academically beautiful to sit down and try to self analyze when you're journaling in the morning which I also do but it's quite another thing to be like okay tough guy.

2175
02:20:11.86 --> 02:20:19.86
Even with that long explanation I just gave it looking at all these people. I wasn't consciously thinking.

2176
02:20:19.86 --> 02:20:27.86
Actually I wasn't even consciously thinking about it from a psychological perspective. I was just thinking it from a pragmatic here's two guys why don't they get along.

2177
02:20:27.86 --> 02:20:42.86
And then when I would see myself do it I go oh you're doing the same stupid stuff. It wasn't like this idea of I was looking at myself and I was just doing what I had to do right.

2178
02:20:42.86 --> 02:20:55.86
I guess there's always the subconscious feeling of trying to do better and trying to self improve but I'm not a person that has the constant like I'm trying to self improve.

2179
02:20:55.86 --> 02:21:06.86
I think it's just a natural thing like yeah I'm trying to get better of course but that's not I don't think about it. I guess that's my point out. I don't think about it. I'm not focused on it. I'm just doing it. I'm just doing it and living it.

2180
02:21:06.86 --> 02:21:24.86
Yeah well I think in your case and I have well we have some mutual friends. I mean from the seals but also for Shreakon and a number of friends who have been engaged at very high levels in elite ranks within the military.

2181
02:21:24.86 --> 02:21:38.86
And I think that in my experience thus far most of them have whether it's by virtue of the filtering that their careers impose on them right.

2182
02:21:38.86 --> 02:21:53.86
I mean if 1000 people start at step one how many make it to step 100 that they self select and are selected to have a high degree of what I would consider or what you could consider mindfulness which is usually a simple way to do

2183
02:21:53.86 --> 02:22:13.86
and that's what usually associated with like hippies and San Francisco with Didri do's and burning men and so on. So it's a buzz word there but I think the ability to detach in that way comes naturally to you and too many people I know who also have made it to step 100.

2184
02:22:13.86 --> 02:22:26.86
They just seem in a military context if you don't have that you and certainly you can get killed or get washed out for many different reasons but I think if for one of them seems to be if you have no self awareness.

2185
02:22:26.86 --> 02:22:41.86
You just you get broken or you get disqualified at some point. Yeah or or you get as good as the machine can make you and I think that's that's the real difference you get as good as the machine them she's going to make you good right but.

2186
02:22:41.86 --> 02:22:51.86
You the only person that can take you past what the machine can make is you right and so if you're not self aware if you can't if you can't figure that out if you can't look in the mirror and see see like things that you can correct.

2187
02:22:51.86 --> 02:23:04.86
Then you're you're just going to be with the machine made you which is a high quality item I mean you know the military's filled with some high quality guys. Great guys fabulous guys that perform outstanding.

2188
02:23:04.86 --> 02:23:19.86
But then there's like this one more level of guys that are you look at when you go man that guys really good what why is that that's because that guy the machine got him to hear and he's looking at himself going what can I do better he's got that detachment and that's definitely.

2189
02:23:19.86 --> 02:23:23.86
Important I got to introduce somebody in this book now.

2190
02:23:26.42 --> 02:23:31.06
That there's his name is Sasaki Kujiro gunrue.

2191
02:23:32.42 --> 02:23:36.90
Let's see the last part yeah you got the first. Yeah and are why you got new yeah.

2192
02:23:36.90 --> 02:23:40.82
Yeah, you guys be hard to say yeah. Yeah. Come on. I got something to go with what I'm going to.

2193
02:23:40.82 --> 02:23:54.82
Yeah. So this guy and he dances in and out throughout the book but this is Musashi's arch rifle the other swordsman that's got this incredible reputation only he's been a little bit more he stays on the scene more

2194
02:23:54.82 --> 02:24:13.62
He's going and trying to farm and do another things and this guy's kind of on the scene and there's there's one part where these elderly gentleman are talking about who is truly the best swordsman slash samurai in Japan and here we go to the book as he compared the two he had to admit that the most

2195
02:24:13.62 --> 02:24:29.62
Dimeo and I said that right time you dimeo dimeo would prefer Kuduro he came from a good family and he had started the art of war thoroughly despite his youth he developed a formable style of his own and he gained considerable fame as a fighter.

2196
02:24:29.62 --> 02:24:43.62
The story of his brilliant defeat of men from the obata academy on the banks of the Sumida River and again at the diek on the condo river was already well known nothing had been heard from Musashi for some time.

2197
02:24:43.62 --> 02:25:07.62
His victory at Ichi Jogi had made his reputation but that had been years ago and soon after word had spread this story that the story was exaggerated that Musashi was a secret of after fame who had trumped up the fight made a flashy attack and then fled to Mount He.

2198
02:25:07.62 --> 02:25:15.62
Every time Musashi did something praise worthy a spate of rumors followed denigrating his character in ability.

2199
02:25:15.62 --> 02:25:32.62
He did reach the point where even the mention of his name usually met with critical remarks or or else people ignored him entirely as the son of a nameless warrior in the mountains of Mima Saka his lineage was insignificant.

2200
02:25:32.62 --> 02:25:46.62
He was a young man and he did not come from the ranks of people that were counseling and keep in line.

2201
02:25:46.62 --> 02:26:06.62
He had some stuff like have battles against whole castles attack people he was kind of crazy and so his reputation and then of course you know this is like I guess ancient social media right there is rumors and they would post signs about people and they would do these things to denigrate people's reputation and such and they had done that considerably to Musashi.

2202
02:26:06.62 --> 02:26:35.62
I was just thinking about how labor intensive it would be you're telling us spreading posters like to hand create piles of posters that you then go post to denigrate someone like the equivalent of a tweet was sitting down for a week and hand making posters put around town and they do it in this book they don't know it's full time as they go on both sides people right side Musashi does it the other people do it it's.

2203
02:26:35.62 --> 02:26:42.62
Yeah it's it's crazy we're getting to getting closer closer.

2204
02:26:42.62 --> 02:26:47.62
Musashi's wandering in the mountains and.

2205
02:26:47.62 --> 02:26:51.62
Here we go back to the book.

2206
02:26:51.62 --> 02:26:55.62
At times he was so tortured with his sword.

2207
02:26:55.62 --> 02:27:01.62
It seemed like a weapon that turned against him among the possibilities he considered was choosing the easy way.

2208
02:27:01.62 --> 02:27:13.62
If he could bring himself to live in a comfortable ordinary way with oats who life would be simple almost any five would be willing to pay him enough to live on perhaps 500 2000 bushels.

2209
02:27:13.62 --> 02:27:15.62
But when he put it.

2210
02:27:15.62 --> 02:27:20.62
But when he put it to himself in the form of a question the answer was always no.

2211
02:27:20.62 --> 02:27:28.62
An easy existence imposed restrictions he could not submit to them.

2212
02:27:28.62 --> 02:27:38.62
So he's got the idea you know I could just marry oats who get a good job make a hundred k a year what all it good.

2213
02:27:38.62 --> 02:27:39.62
He doesn't like that.

2214
02:27:39.62 --> 02:27:47.62
The easy path has restrictions it is the discipline that provides freedom apparently for Musashi.

2215
02:27:47.62 --> 02:27:59.62
Well, just as a contemporary example one of my I would consider him a teacher certainly become a friend but.

2216
02:27:59.62 --> 02:28:06.62
A political originally at least when he came to the US Polish political refugee named Jersey Gregoric is now in his 60s lives in woodside California and he's a.

2217
02:28:06.62 --> 02:28:11.62
World champion and world record holder in Olympic weightlifting.

2218
02:28:11.62 --> 02:28:18.62
And he's a good boy cast by the way.

2219
02:28:18.62 --> 02:28:22.62
Yeah, he's he's awesome. He's so salty and to give people a little bit of back on the first time I met him.

2220
02:28:22.62 --> 02:28:30.62
I was just at the time suffering from a malaise in a general fatigue with the.

2221
02:28:30.62 --> 02:28:39.62
My first sense of the ability of the Bay Area. And I walked in to meet him for the first time to get an assessment and we sat down and we drank.

2222
02:28:39.62 --> 02:28:42.62
Mark O'Pollo black tea, it's the only tea that he drinks and we're hanging.

2223
02:28:42.62 --> 02:28:46.62
I have a seat so I sit down or talking he's asking about my goals.

2224
02:28:46.62 --> 02:28:54.62
But my athletic background past injuries and he's sitting across me is eating great ship is in his 60s he can still do.

2225
02:28:54.62 --> 02:29:05.62
As an example, I've seen him on an indoor board. You know, those are his balance boards like a wobble board on top of a cylinder with a loaded barbell.

2226
02:29:05.62 --> 02:29:10.62
He's holding a loaded barbell in a position like a hand clean on an indoor board.

2227
02:29:10.62 --> 02:29:19.62
He's in his 60s throw it up, you know, like a 150 to 100 pounds and land in a full Astahiels snatch on an indoor bar.

2228
02:29:19.62 --> 02:29:32.62
He's a legit and so he reached across sipping tea and then he stopped mid mid thought and reached across and sort of pinched my right to it and just said, you are too fat.

2229
02:29:32.62 --> 02:29:36.62
So I just love this guy. Like after that I was like, yes, we are going to work together.

2230
02:29:36.62 --> 02:29:47.62
But his one of his mantras that he uses for everything is easy choices, hard life, hard choices, easy life.

2231
02:29:47.62 --> 02:29:52.62
This one equals freedom. For sure. That's awesome. That is awesome.

2232
02:29:52.62 --> 02:29:56.62
Did you like get on the program with him? I did for quite a period of time.

2233
02:29:56.62 --> 02:30:00.62
Yeah. And were you traveling down? How did you do? Do you fall in a structure?

2234
02:30:00.62 --> 02:30:07.62
I was actually coaching you. I traveled down regularly and made excellent progress.

2235
02:30:07.62 --> 02:30:14.62
It's very to do Olympic weightlifting the way that jersey would want you to do it.

2236
02:30:14.62 --> 02:30:19.62
And which is the way I would want to do it. You really need hands on instruction.

2237
02:30:19.62 --> 02:30:28.62
It's highly highly highly technical and also you need a logical progression because most people who just want to do a weekend course and figure out the snatch.

2238
02:30:28.62 --> 02:30:35.62
They do not have any of the ankle or shoulder mobility, thoracic spine mobility to even perform the right movement.

2239
02:30:35.62 --> 02:30:43.62
But regardless of who the instructor is, they could have a 500-time world champion teaching them and doing video recording.

2240
02:30:43.62 --> 02:30:46.62
But if they had don't have the mobility, they're just going to hurt themselves.

2241
02:30:46.62 --> 02:30:53.62
So I went down regularly and then when I was traveling with send him video and he would reply with video commentary.

2242
02:30:53.62 --> 02:31:03.62
Great experience. I still think the jersey style relatively narrow stance as to the grass overhead squat.

2243
02:31:03.62 --> 02:31:05.62
I want to the best movements.

2244
02:31:05.62 --> 02:31:08.62
What? How wide does this grip when he does that?

2245
02:31:08.62 --> 02:31:10.62
It's a snatch grip. So there'd be a wide grip.

2246
02:31:10.62 --> 02:31:11.62
Wide grip.

2247
02:31:11.62 --> 02:31:20.62
But he can. There are videos of jersey. People can look about JER, ZY, Gregorek, G, RIG, ORAK.

2248
02:31:20.62 --> 02:31:25.62
There are videos that he is one of the most flexible mobile humans I've ever seen. He's strong as an ox.

2249
02:31:25.62 --> 02:31:36.62
But he can with his feet together holding a 35-pound plate overhead with his hands flat underneath it.

2250
02:31:36.62 --> 02:31:39.62
He's holding a dinner platter.

2251
02:31:39.62 --> 02:31:43.62
Go down into a perfect squat with his chest up.

2252
02:31:43.62 --> 02:31:49.62
Asked to his heels holding that overhead with his fingers basically touching.

2253
02:31:49.62 --> 02:31:56.62
Yeah. Which people might say, oh, I can do that. Trust me you can.

2254
02:31:56.62 --> 02:31:58.62
That's awesome.

2255
02:31:58.62 --> 02:32:02.62
So we're getting towards the end here.

2256
02:32:02.62 --> 02:32:07.62
This again, this rivalry is brewing.

2257
02:32:07.62 --> 02:32:10.62
And finally, there is a speaking of social media.

2258
02:32:10.62 --> 02:32:13.62
There is a command issued by the castle.

2259
02:32:13.62 --> 02:32:19.62
There's what it says on the 13th day of this month at 8 o'clock in the morning on FUNA SHIMA

2260
02:32:19.62 --> 02:32:28.62
in the Nagato streets of BUSIN. SASAKI KIGERO GANRU, a samurai of this fight,

2261
02:32:28.62 --> 02:32:34.62
will add his lordship's bidding fight about with Miyamoto Masashi, Masana,

2262
02:32:34.62 --> 02:32:38.62
a roan in from the province of NIMASAKA.

2263
02:32:38.62 --> 02:32:45.62
It is strictly forbidden for supporters of either swordsmen to go to his aid or set forth on the water

2264
02:32:45.62 --> 02:32:50.62
between the mainland and FUSHINAMA and FUNA SHIMA. Sorry.

2265
02:32:50.62 --> 02:32:56.62
Until 10 o'clock on the morning of the 13th, no sightseeing vessels, passengerships,

2266
02:32:56.62 --> 02:33:00.62
and fishing boats will be permitted to enter the streets.

2267
02:33:00.62 --> 02:33:05.62
1612, that document right there. So there you go.

2268
02:33:05.62 --> 02:33:08.62
It's on. They're going to fight.

2269
02:33:08.62 --> 02:33:17.62
And for people wondering what roan is that is a masterless warrior that is a samurai without a lord.

2270
02:33:17.62 --> 02:33:23.62
A floating person, a ninnous person.

2271
02:33:23.62 --> 02:33:27.62
And you could think of them in some cases.

2272
02:33:27.62 --> 02:33:31.62
I mean, they would either be freelance, self-directed learners,

2273
02:33:31.62 --> 02:33:35.62
an auto-diadact, like Musashi or they would be mercenaries.

2274
02:33:35.62 --> 02:33:39.62
So roan and were also swords for higher.

2275
02:33:39.62 --> 02:33:41.62
Negative connotation to it.

2276
02:33:41.62 --> 02:33:44.62
Negative connotation. I would say. For sure.

2277
02:33:44.62 --> 02:33:53.62
Negative connotation simply because the lineage and association in Japanese culture is so important

2278
02:33:53.62 --> 02:34:01.62
that if you don't have a master or a particular thief that you're associated with,

2279
02:34:01.62 --> 02:34:09.62
particularly if you come from your born of unknown origins or from a no name warrior,

2280
02:34:09.62 --> 02:34:13.62
it is very much an important class distinction.

2281
02:34:13.62 --> 02:34:19.62
And Sasaki also, as I understand it, this may come up later,

2282
02:34:19.62 --> 02:34:23.62
but used a slightly different sword.

2283
02:34:23.62 --> 02:34:27.62
And we can get to that moment.

2284
02:34:27.62 --> 02:34:33.62
No, no, it's cool. He uses a sword called the drying pole.

2285
02:34:33.62 --> 02:34:39.62
And for years, until I was actually prepping for this podcast,

2286
02:34:39.62 --> 02:34:43.62
I thought that that was a badass name for a sword, of course.

2287
02:34:43.62 --> 02:34:47.62
But what I thought, I always thought to myself, that means it drives you of your blood.

2288
02:34:47.62 --> 02:34:49.62
That's what I thought it meant.

2289
02:34:49.62 --> 02:34:51.62
It drives you of your blood.

2290
02:34:51.62 --> 02:34:53.62
And then as I was researching for this podcast,

2291
02:34:53.62 --> 02:34:57.62
it's actually, and correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I found,

2292
02:34:57.62 --> 02:35:03.62
there's a method of drying your clothes on a stick, a long stick.

2293
02:35:03.62 --> 02:35:06.62
And his sword was longer than most swords.

2294
02:35:06.62 --> 02:35:10.62
And so the full name of it was the closed drying sword.

2295
02:35:10.62 --> 02:35:12.62
Did I get all that right?

2296
02:35:12.62 --> 02:35:15.62
That part, I'm not sure if it makes sense to me.

2297
02:35:15.62 --> 02:35:19.62
And I remember when I was in Japan a number of years ago,

2298
02:35:19.62 --> 02:35:21.62
I go back as often as I possibly can.

2299
02:35:21.62 --> 02:35:23.62
And I'm still in close contact with my host family.

2300
02:35:23.62 --> 02:35:25.62
I've been to my brothers' weddings and so on.

2301
02:35:25.62 --> 02:35:27.62
It's just been fantastic.

2302
02:35:27.62 --> 02:35:33.62
And I went back and I went to a Japanese sword museum,

2303
02:35:33.62 --> 02:35:35.62
which was incredibly hard to find.

2304
02:35:35.62 --> 02:35:37.62
And it was empty.

2305
02:35:37.62 --> 02:35:42.62
And the, I'm decent at, still decent at reading Japanese,

2306
02:35:42.62 --> 02:35:44.62
but it's been a long time.

2307
02:35:44.62 --> 02:35:48.62
I mean, it's been almost 20 years, more than 20 years since I formally studied it.

2308
02:35:48.62 --> 02:35:52.62
So given there are thousands of characters, one gets a little rusty.

2309
02:35:52.62 --> 02:35:57.62
And I went into this Japanese sword museum and the displays and everything.

2310
02:35:57.62 --> 02:35:58.62
You can imagine.

2311
02:35:58.62 --> 02:35:59.62
I mean, Japan.

2312
02:35:59.62 --> 02:36:00.62
Things are clean, meticulous.

2313
02:36:00.62 --> 02:36:04.62
And I went in and it was just walls and walls of displays

2314
02:36:04.62 --> 02:36:06.62
with different swords from different eras.

2315
02:36:06.62 --> 02:36:08.62
So I mean, swords we're talking about.

2316
02:36:08.62 --> 02:36:12.62
Swords from these eras are there preserved,

2317
02:36:12.62 --> 02:36:14.62
look brand new.

2318
02:36:14.62 --> 02:36:18.62
And I was walking around and there was a gentleman who is cleaning.

2319
02:36:18.62 --> 02:36:22.62
And I asked him a question at one point about how to pronounce a character.

2320
02:36:22.62 --> 02:36:28.62
And he proceeded to pause his cleaning and walk me through the entire museum explaining how each of them was used.

2321
02:36:28.62 --> 02:36:32.62
And one of them, or one type I should say,

2322
02:36:32.62 --> 02:36:34.62
which I believe is what Sasaki used.

2323
02:36:34.62 --> 02:36:35.62
It is long.

2324
02:36:35.62 --> 02:36:37.62
And it's called a dachi.

2325
02:36:37.62 --> 02:36:38.62
I think it's dachi.

2326
02:36:38.62 --> 02:36:41.62
And the difference, the most remarkable difference is,

2327
02:36:41.62 --> 02:36:43.62
hey, yes, it's very long.

2328
02:36:43.62 --> 02:36:45.62
And it is curved.

2329
02:36:45.62 --> 02:36:49.62
And it would be used very often by horsemen.

2330
02:36:49.62 --> 02:36:56.62
And it was curved so that they could strike down their opponents

2331
02:36:56.62 --> 02:37:00.62
without getting the blades stuck in their bodies.

2332
02:37:00.62 --> 02:37:05.62
Because if you have a straight blade, or relatively straight blade, like Katana,

2333
02:37:05.62 --> 02:37:10.62
it's almost like having a straight blade-ed hatchet that you swing into a tree.

2334
02:37:10.62 --> 02:37:11.62
It's like fuck.

2335
02:37:11.62 --> 02:37:12.62
And it gets stuck.

2336
02:37:12.62 --> 02:37:14.62
Well, if you're on horseback, that's a big problem.

2337
02:37:14.62 --> 02:37:16.62
You lose your sword.

2338
02:37:16.62 --> 02:37:18.62
You're in a very bad position.

2339
02:37:18.62 --> 02:37:23.62
And so it would be more of a slicing motion, as opposed to a chopping motion.

2340
02:37:23.62 --> 02:37:26.62
And the dachi was very effective for that reason.

2341
02:37:26.62 --> 02:37:28.62
Also, another reason that it tended to be longer.

2342
02:37:28.62 --> 02:37:31.62
Yeah, because you're fighting from on top of the horse, so you got to reach down.

2343
02:37:31.62 --> 02:37:39.62
Yeah, apparently they were saying that this sword was about nine to 12 inches longer than the normal sword.

2344
02:37:39.62 --> 02:37:43.62
And they gave it this name the drawing pool, which again, I always thought was about.

2345
02:37:43.62 --> 02:37:47.62
That's the way my mind works, echo, trials don't be laughing.

2346
02:37:47.62 --> 02:37:48.62
Turn it out.

2347
02:37:48.62 --> 02:37:51.62
It's just trying everything's there where outside of the broom handle.

2348
02:37:51.62 --> 02:37:53.62
Everything's cooler in my brain.

2349
02:37:59.62 --> 02:38:00.62
Oh, too.

2350
02:38:00.62 --> 02:38:06.62
By the way, this whole time that she's been in and out, she's, they've never actually like gotten together

2351
02:38:06.62 --> 02:38:11.62
as whatever mates or as permanent partners, right?

2352
02:38:11.62 --> 02:38:14.62
It's always just been this kind of thing.

2353
02:38:14.62 --> 02:38:15.62
Very Japanese.

2354
02:38:15.62 --> 02:38:16.62
Yeah.

2355
02:38:16.62 --> 02:38:18.62
Oh, is that very Japanese?

2356
02:38:18.62 --> 02:38:24.62
Yeah, yeah, I would say so, just this very, what we would consider sort of awkward.

2357
02:38:24.62 --> 02:38:27.62
Dension that never has resolution.

2358
02:38:27.62 --> 02:38:28.62
Right.

2359
02:38:28.62 --> 02:38:30.62
Well, then that's exactly what this is.

2360
02:38:30.62 --> 02:38:32.62
And that's exactly where they've been for,

2361
02:38:32.62 --> 02:38:37.62
962 pages of a look, right? Awkward tension for 962 pages.

2362
02:38:37.62 --> 02:38:39.62
And God bless her.

2363
02:38:39.62 --> 02:38:41.62
She's still like saying, hey, I'm here for you.

2364
02:38:41.62 --> 02:38:45.62
Even though he told her, I love my sword and not you.

2365
02:38:45.62 --> 02:38:49.62
Well, not to be fair. He said, I love my sword more than I love you.

2366
02:38:49.62 --> 02:38:51.62
No, he said, I don't dislike you.

2367
02:38:51.62 --> 02:38:52.62
Yeah.

2368
02:38:52.62 --> 02:38:57.62
Which in massage he speak is like, I will love you until my dying day.

2369
02:38:57.62 --> 02:38:58.62
True. True.

2370
02:38:58.62 --> 02:39:07.62
So she is going to say goodbye to her because there's, you know, this is a, this is a, this is a match where someone is going to die.

2371
02:39:07.62 --> 02:39:17.62
And it's, I guess I'm looking at it's a little bit the older guy that is been out of practice against the young stud that's in the game fully.

2372
02:39:17.62 --> 02:39:23.62
So it seems like people are thinking, there's a good chance he's going to die.

2373
02:39:23.62 --> 02:39:28.62
So he's having that final conversation with her. Oh, two, please forgive me.

2374
02:39:28.62 --> 02:39:32.62
I may seem harmless, but I'm not, not where you're concerned.

2375
02:39:32.62 --> 02:39:36.62
I, I know that. Do you? Truly?

2376
02:39:36.62 --> 02:39:39.62
Yes, but I beg you, say one word for me.

2377
02:39:39.62 --> 02:39:41.62
Just one word.

2378
02:39:41.62 --> 02:39:43.62
Tell me that I'm your wife.

2379
02:39:43.62 --> 02:39:48.62
It would spoil it if I told you what you know already.

2380
02:39:48.62 --> 02:39:56.62
But, but she was sobbing with her whole body, but with a burst of strength she seized his hand and cried, say it,

2381
02:39:56.62 --> 02:39:59.62
Sam your wife throughout this life.

2382
02:39:59.62 --> 02:40:03.62
He nodded slowly, silently.

2383
02:40:03.62 --> 02:40:08.62
Then one by one he pulled her delicate fingers from his arm and stood erect.

2384
02:40:08.62 --> 02:40:13.62
A samurai's wife must not weep and go to pieces when he goes off to war.

2385
02:40:13.62 --> 02:40:18.62
Lath from the Oatsu, send me away with a smile.

2386
02:40:18.62 --> 02:40:22.62
This may be your husband's last departure.

2387
02:40:22.62 --> 02:40:26.62
Both knew the time had come.

2388
02:40:26.62 --> 02:40:29.62
For a brief moment he looked at her and smiled.

2389
02:40:29.62 --> 02:40:33.62
Then he said, until then.

2390
02:40:33.62 --> 02:40:40.62
Yes, until then. She wanted to return to smile, but only managed to hold back the tears.

2391
02:40:40.62 --> 02:40:46.62
Farewell. He turned and walked with firm strides towards the water's edge.

2392
02:40:46.62 --> 02:40:50.62
A parting word rose to her throat, but refused to be hugged.

2393
02:40:50.62 --> 02:40:54.62
The tears welled up irrepressibly.

2394
02:40:54.62 --> 02:40:57.62
She could no longer see him.

2395
02:40:57.62 --> 02:41:03.62
The strong, salty wind ruffled Musashi's side burns, his kimono flapped briskly.

2396
02:41:03.62 --> 02:41:07.62
Sasuki, bring the boat a little closer.

2397
02:41:07.62 --> 02:41:12.62
Though he had been waiting for over two hours and Numu-sashi was on the beach,

2398
02:41:12.62 --> 02:41:15.62
Sasuki had carefully kept his eyes inverted.

2399
02:41:15.62 --> 02:41:19.62
Now he looked at Musashi and said, right away, sir,

2400
02:41:19.62 --> 02:41:23.62
where the few strong rapid movements he pulled the boat in.

2401
02:41:23.62 --> 02:41:29.62
When it touched the shore, Musashi jumped lightly into the prow and they moved out to sea.

2402
02:41:29.62 --> 02:41:32.62
Oatsu stopped.

2403
02:41:32.62 --> 02:41:36.62
The shout was to Taro's, another guy that's there on the scene.

2404
02:41:36.62 --> 02:41:40.62
Oatsu was running straight toward the water. He raised after her, startled.

2405
02:41:40.62 --> 02:41:44.62
Gona Suki and Oatsu keep joined the chase. Oatsu stopped. What are you doing?

2406
02:41:44.62 --> 02:41:46.62
Don't be foolish.

2407
02:41:46.62 --> 02:41:51.62
Reaching her simultaneously, they threw her arms around her and held her back.

2408
02:41:51.62 --> 02:41:56.62
No, no, she protested shaking her head slowly. You don't understand.

2409
02:41:56.62 --> 02:41:58.62
What are you trying to do?

2410
02:41:58.62 --> 02:42:01.62
Let me sit down by myself.

2411
02:42:01.62 --> 02:42:03.62
Her voice was calm.

2412
02:42:03.62 --> 02:42:07.62
When they released her and she walked with dignity to a spot a few yards away,

2413
02:42:07.62 --> 02:42:11.62
where she knelt on the sand, seemingly exhausted.

2414
02:42:11.62 --> 02:42:16.62
But she had found her strength. She straightened her collar, smoothed her hair,

2415
02:42:16.62 --> 02:42:21.62
and bowed her head towards Musashi's little craft.

2416
02:42:21.62 --> 02:42:25.62
Go without regrets, she said.

2417
02:42:25.62 --> 02:42:31.62
That's how you do it right there.

2418
02:42:31.62 --> 02:42:37.62
So again, it was mentioned, or if I didn't explain that well enough,

2419
02:42:37.62 --> 02:42:41.62
this battle is going to take place on an island in the middle of a stream.

2420
02:42:41.62 --> 02:42:43.62
And, or straight?

2421
02:42:43.62 --> 02:42:47.62
Yeah, or is it straight? What's the difference between those two?

2422
02:42:47.62 --> 02:42:49.62
Well, actually, that's a great question.

2423
02:42:49.62 --> 02:42:52.62
The way I sit this out, this is fun.

2424
02:42:52.62 --> 02:42:55.62
I mean, a novel like this is created in your own head.

2425
02:42:55.62 --> 02:42:57.62
It's an active experience of creating.

2426
02:42:57.62 --> 02:43:01.62
So in my head, and maybe I don't know what a straight is.

2427
02:43:01.62 --> 02:43:08.62
But the way I envisioned a straight was almost like a small or extended,

2428
02:43:08.62 --> 02:43:16.62
so long but narrow sand bank in the middle of, say, a river.

2429
02:43:16.62 --> 02:43:19.62
Okay, or a but a wide river, like Mississippi.

2430
02:43:19.62 --> 02:43:21.62
Yeah, that's kind of what I pictured to your.

2431
02:43:21.62 --> 02:43:26.62
I pictured a wide, wide river that has a little un inhabited sort of,

2432
02:43:26.62 --> 02:43:28.62
sort of strip of land in the middle.

2433
02:43:28.62 --> 02:43:29.62
Yeah, exactly.

2434
02:43:29.62 --> 02:43:30.62
That's what I pictured.

2435
02:43:30.62 --> 02:43:31.62
And that's what you picture too.

2436
02:43:31.62 --> 02:43:34.62
So we created the same thing.

2437
02:43:34.62 --> 02:43:40.62
So he's in this boat, and he's headed, obviously he's running late.

2438
02:43:40.62 --> 02:43:43.62
And as per usual, as per usual.

2439
02:43:43.62 --> 02:43:47.62
And here we go to the book, Sussouki.

2440
02:43:47.62 --> 02:43:50.62
May I have this? What is it?

2441
02:43:50.62 --> 02:43:53.62
This broken or in the bottom of the boat?

2442
02:43:53.62 --> 02:43:56.62
I don't need it. Why do you want it?

2443
02:43:56.62 --> 02:43:58.62
It's about the right size.

2444
02:43:58.62 --> 02:44:01.62
Mousashi said cryptically.

2445
02:44:01.62 --> 02:44:07.62
He held the slightly waterlogged or out with one hand and squinted down it to see if it was straight.

2446
02:44:07.62 --> 02:44:10.62
One edge of the blade was split off.

2447
02:44:10.62 --> 02:44:16.62
He placed the oron as knee, and totally absorbed, began carving with his short sword.

2448
02:44:16.62 --> 02:44:27.62
Sussouki cast backward glances toward Shimo Sekhi several times, but Mousashi seemed oblivious of the people he left behind.

2449
02:44:27.62 --> 02:44:35.62
Was this the way a samurai approached a life and death battle to a town's been like Sussouki.

2450
02:44:35.62 --> 02:44:38.62
It was cold and hardless.

2451
02:44:38.62 --> 02:44:41.62
So it's important.

2452
02:44:41.62 --> 02:44:44.62
He picked up this old waterlogged or from the bottom of the boat.

2453
02:44:44.62 --> 02:44:46.62
Says, can I have this? The guy says, yeah, sure.

2454
02:44:46.62 --> 02:44:49.62
And now he starts carving it.

2455
02:44:49.62 --> 02:44:54.62
Sussouki was growing more and more nervous with each stroke of the skull.

2456
02:44:54.62 --> 02:44:58.62
He had broken out in a cold sweat. His heart was palpitating.

2457
02:44:58.62 --> 02:45:01.62
How could a man going into battle be so calm?

2458
02:45:01.62 --> 02:45:03.62
It would be a fight to the death.

2459
02:45:03.62 --> 02:45:05.62
No question about that.

2460
02:45:05.62 --> 02:45:08.62
Would he be taking a passenger back to the mainland later?

2461
02:45:08.62 --> 02:45:11.62
Or a cruelly maimed corpse?

2462
02:45:11.62 --> 02:45:18.62
There was no way of knowing. Mousashi thought Sussouki was like a white cloud floating across the sky.

2463
02:45:18.62 --> 02:45:21.62
This was not opposed on Mousashi's part.

2464
02:45:21.62 --> 02:45:25.62
For in fact, he was thinking of nothing at all.

2465
02:45:25.62 --> 02:45:29.62
He was, if anything, a little bored.

2466
02:45:29.62 --> 02:45:33.62
He looked over the side of the boat at the swirling blue water.

2467
02:45:33.62 --> 02:45:38.62
It was deep here, infinitely deep, and alive with what seemed to be eternal life.

2468
02:45:38.62 --> 02:45:42.62
But water had no fixed determined form.

2469
02:45:42.62 --> 02:45:48.62
Was it not because man had a fixed determined form that he cannot possess eternal life?

2470
02:45:48.62 --> 02:45:54.62
Does not true life begin only when tangible form has been lost?

2471
02:45:54.62 --> 02:46:00.62
Tumashashi's eyes, life and death seemed like so much froth.

2472
02:46:00.62 --> 02:46:05.62
He felt goose pimples on his skin, not from the cold water,

2473
02:46:05.62 --> 02:46:08.62
because his body felt the premonition.

2474
02:46:08.62 --> 02:46:16.62
Through his mind had risen above life and death, body and mind were not in a cord.

2475
02:46:16.62 --> 02:46:23.62
When every poor of his body, as well as his mind, forgot there would remain nothing inside,

2476
02:46:23.62 --> 02:46:29.62
but being inside his being, but the water and the clouds.

2477
02:46:29.62 --> 02:46:32.62
So he's going into a full-on like...

2478
02:46:32.62 --> 02:46:35.62
...a little bit here.

2479
02:46:35.62 --> 02:46:38.62
They arrived at the island.

2480
02:46:38.62 --> 02:46:41.62
Ghosts straight in, Musashi flew off the quilted coat.

2481
02:46:41.62 --> 02:46:44.62
The bow advanced at a very restrained pace,

2482
02:46:44.62 --> 02:46:47.62
so Zyukik could not bring himself to stroke with vigor.

2483
02:46:47.62 --> 02:46:50.62
His arms moved only slightly, exerting little force.

2484
02:46:50.62 --> 02:46:53.62
The sound of bulbous was in the air.

2485
02:46:53.62 --> 02:46:55.62
Sassuki, yes sir.

2486
02:46:55.62 --> 02:46:58.62
It shall not be the same as the sun.

2487
02:46:58.62 --> 02:47:02.62
Sassuki, yes sir.

2488
02:47:02.62 --> 02:47:04.62
It shall not be here.

2489
02:47:04.62 --> 02:47:06.62
There's no need to get close.

2490
02:47:06.62 --> 02:47:08.62
You don't want to damage your boat.

2491
02:47:08.62 --> 02:47:11.62
Besides, it's about time for the tide to turn.

2492
02:47:11.62 --> 02:47:17.62
Silent Lisa Zyukik fixed his eyes on a tall thin pine tree standing alone.

2493
02:47:17.62 --> 02:47:22.62
Underneath it, the wind was playing with a brilliant red cloak.

2494
02:47:22.62 --> 02:47:27.62
Sassuki started to point, but realized that Musashi had already seen his opponent.

2495
02:47:27.62 --> 02:47:36.62
Keeping his eyes on Ganru, Musashi took a russet, hand towel from his OB, folded it in four lengthwise,

2496
02:47:36.62 --> 02:47:40.62
and tied it around his wind blown hair.

2497
02:47:40.62 --> 02:47:44.62
Then he shifted his short sword to the front of his OB.

2498
02:47:44.62 --> 02:47:48.62
Taking off his long sword, he laid it in the bottom of the boat,

2499
02:47:48.62 --> 02:47:51.62
and covered it with a red mat.

2500
02:47:51.62 --> 02:47:56.62
In his right hand, he held the wooden sword he had made from the broken ore.

2501
02:47:56.62 --> 02:47:58.62
This is far enough.

2502
02:47:58.62 --> 02:48:03.62
He said this is Yuki.

2503
02:48:03.62 --> 02:48:08.62
So, he's going to fight the best swordsman in the world.

2504
02:48:08.62 --> 02:48:18.62
He curves up, wooden sword out of an ore on the way, leaves his long sword in the boat.

2505
02:48:18.62 --> 02:48:26.62
And this is a novel, but there's also some historic precedent for this.

2506
02:48:26.62 --> 02:48:39.62
So he would routinely use wooden swords when dealing with opponents who were using live blades.

2507
02:48:39.62 --> 02:48:45.62
Back to the book, at that moment, Musashi, his Hakama, which is pants.

2508
02:48:45.62 --> 02:48:49.62
Yeah, it's kind of like a Japanese kilt.

2509
02:48:49.62 --> 02:48:53.62
Let's say very, very long, usually comes down to the angles.

2510
02:48:53.62 --> 02:48:59.62
His Hakama hitched high on both sides, jumped lightly into the sea, landing so lightly.

2511
02:48:59.62 --> 02:49:00.62
Barely made a splash.

2512
02:49:00.62 --> 02:49:05.62
He strode rapidly toward the waterline, his wooden sword cutting through the spray.

2513
02:49:05.62 --> 02:49:08.62
Five steps, ten steps.

2514
02:49:08.62 --> 02:49:16.62
Susuki, abandoning his skull, watched in wonderment unconscious of where he was, what he was doing.

2515
02:49:16.62 --> 02:49:24.62
As Ganru, street-dway from the pine, like a red streamer, his polished scabbard caught the glint of the sun.

2516
02:49:24.62 --> 02:49:26.62
Musashi!

2517
02:49:26.62 --> 02:49:32.62
Ganru planted his feet resolutely in the sand unwilling to give up an inch.

2518
02:49:32.62 --> 02:49:37.62
Musashi stopped and stood still, exposed to the water in the wind.

2519
02:49:37.62 --> 02:49:41.62
A hint of a gran appeared on his face.

2520
02:49:41.62 --> 02:49:49.62
Coduro, he said quietly, there was an unearthly fierceness in his eyes, a force pulling so irresistibly.

2521
02:49:49.62 --> 02:49:55.62
It threatened to draw Coduro inexorably into the peril and destruction.

2522
02:49:55.62 --> 02:50:02.62
The waves washed his wooden sword, Ganru's were the eyes that shot fire.

2523
02:50:02.62 --> 02:50:13.62
The blood thirsty flame burned in his pupils like the rainbows of fierce intensity, seeking to terrify and debilitate.

2524
02:50:13.62 --> 02:50:15.62
Musashi!

2525
02:50:15.62 --> 02:50:17.62
No answer.

2526
02:50:17.62 --> 02:50:19.62
Musashi!

2527
02:50:19.62 --> 02:50:26.62
The sea rumbled ominously in the distance, the tide lapped and murmured at the two men's feet.

2528
02:50:26.62 --> 02:50:32.62
Your lady again aren't you, is at your strategy? As far as I'm concerned, it's a cowardly play.

2529
02:50:32.62 --> 02:50:38.62
It's two hours past the appointed time. I was here at eight, just as promised, I've been waiting.

2530
02:50:38.62 --> 02:50:41.62
Musashi did not reply.

2531
02:50:41.62 --> 02:50:48.62
You did this at each e. Joji, and before that at the Ren Gion.

2532
02:50:48.62 --> 02:50:52.62
Your method seems to be to throw your pointed off by deliberately making him wait.

2533
02:50:52.62 --> 02:51:01.62
That trick will get you nowhere with Ganru. Now prepare your spirit and come forward bravely, so future generations won't laugh at you.

2534
02:51:01.62 --> 02:51:05.62
Come ahead and fight Musashi.

2535
02:51:05.62 --> 02:51:11.62
The end of his scabbard rose high behind him as he drew the great drying pole.

2536
02:51:11.62 --> 02:51:17.62
With his left hand, he slid off the scabbard and threw it into the water.

2537
02:51:17.62 --> 02:51:24.62
Waiting just long enough for a wave to strike the reef and retreat. Musashi suddenly said in a quiet voice,

2538
02:51:24.62 --> 02:51:27.62
you've lost co-gero.

2539
02:51:27.62 --> 02:51:32.62
What? Ganru is kicking to the core. The fight's been fought.

2540
02:51:32.62 --> 02:51:36.62
I say you've been defeated. What are you talking about?

2541
02:51:36.62 --> 02:51:40.62
If you're going to win, you wouldn't throw your scabbard away.

2542
02:51:40.62 --> 02:51:43.62
You've cast away your future, your life.

2543
02:51:43.62 --> 02:51:45.62
Words!

2544
02:51:45.62 --> 02:51:48.62
For nonsense! Too bad cajaro.

2545
02:51:48.62 --> 02:51:52.62
Ready to fall? Do you want to get it over with fast?

2546
02:51:52.62 --> 02:51:57.62
Come! Come forward! You bastard!

2547
02:51:57.62 --> 02:51:59.62
Oh!

2548
02:51:59.62 --> 02:52:04.62
Musashi's cry in the sound of the water rose to a crescendo together.

2549
02:52:04.62 --> 02:52:11.62
Stepping into the water, the drying pole positioned high above his head, Ganru faced Musashi squarely.

2550
02:52:11.62 --> 02:52:18.62
A line of light foam streped across the surface as Musashi ran up on shore to Ganru's left.

2551
02:52:18.62 --> 02:52:20.62
Ganru pursued.

2552
02:52:20.62 --> 02:52:26.62
Musashi's feet left the water and touched the sand at almost the same instant that Ganru's sword.

2553
02:52:26.62 --> 02:52:30.62
His whole body hurdled at him like a fine fish.

2554
02:52:30.62 --> 02:52:33.62
When Musashi sensed that the drying pole was coming toward him,

2555
02:52:33.62 --> 02:52:39.62
his body was still at the end of the motion that had taken him out of the water leaning slightly forward.

2556
02:52:39.62 --> 02:52:47.62
He held the wooden sword with both hands, extended out to the right behind him and partially hid.

2557
02:52:47.62 --> 02:52:55.62
Satisfied with his position, he half grunted and almost noiseless sound that wafted before Ganru's face.

2558
02:52:55.62 --> 02:53:02.62
The drying pole had appeared to be on the verge of a downward slice, but it wavered slightly, then stopped.

2559
02:53:02.62 --> 02:53:09.62
Nine feet away from Musashi, Ganru changed directions by leaping nimbly to the right.

2560
02:53:09.62 --> 02:53:12.62
The two men stared at each other.

2561
02:53:12.62 --> 02:53:17.62
Musashi, two or three paces from the water, had the sea to his back.

2562
02:53:17.62 --> 02:53:22.62
Ganru was facing him, his sword held high with both hands.

2563
02:53:22.62 --> 02:53:30.62
Their lives were totally absorbed and deadly combat, and both were free from conscious thought.

2564
02:53:30.62 --> 02:53:41.62
The scene of battle was a perfect vacuum, but in the waiting stations and beyond the sound of the waves countless people held their breaths.

2565
02:53:41.62 --> 02:53:48.62
Above Ganru hovered the prayers and the hopes of those who believed in him and wanted him to live.

2566
02:53:48.62 --> 02:53:54.62
Above Musashi, the prayers and hopes of others.

2567
02:53:54.62 --> 02:54:07.62
Of Sadou and Ioriyon the island, of Otzu and Otsu-gai, Otsu-gi, and Gono-suki on the beach of Akami and Madahachi on their hill.

2568
02:54:07.62 --> 02:54:11.62
All their prayers were directed to heaven.

2569
02:54:11.62 --> 02:54:16.62
Here, hopes, prayers and the gods were of no assistance.

2570
02:54:16.62 --> 02:54:19.62
Nor was chance.

2571
02:54:19.62 --> 02:54:26.62
There was only a vacuum, in personal and perfectly impartial.

2572
02:54:26.62 --> 02:54:38.62
Is this vacuum so difficult of achievement by one who has life the perfect expression of the mind that is risen above thought and transcended ideas?

2573
02:54:38.62 --> 02:54:41.62
The two men spoke without speaking.

2574
02:54:41.62 --> 02:54:53.62
Then to each came the unconscious realization of the other. The pores of their bodies stood out like needles directed at the adversary.

2575
02:54:53.62 --> 02:55:04.62
Mussels, flesh, nail, hair, even eyebrows, all bodily elements that partake of life were united into a single force against the enemy,

2576
02:55:04.62 --> 02:55:09.62
defending the living organism of which they were part.

2577
02:55:09.62 --> 02:55:20.62
The mind alone was one with the universe clear and untrubbled, like the reflection of the moon in upon the midst of the ragings of a typhoon.

2578
02:55:20.62 --> 02:55:27.62
To reach this so blind immobility is the supreme achievement.

2579
02:55:27.62 --> 02:55:38.62
It seemed like Eons, but the interval was in fact short. The time required for the waves to come in and recede a half a dozen times.

2580
02:55:38.62 --> 02:55:45.62
Then a great shout, more than vocal, coming from the depths of being shattered the instant.

2581
02:55:45.62 --> 02:55:51.62
It came from Ghanru and was followed immediately by Musashi's shout.

2582
02:55:51.62 --> 02:55:58.62
The two cries like angry waves lashing a rocky shore sent their spirit skyward.

2583
02:55:58.62 --> 02:56:07.62
The challenger soared raised so high that it seemed to threaten the sun, straight through the air like a rainbow.

2584
02:56:07.62 --> 02:56:17.62
Musashi threw his shoulder, his left shoulder forward, drew his right foot back and shifted his upper body into a position half facing his opponent.

2585
02:56:17.62 --> 02:56:27.62
His wooden sword held in both hands swept through the air at the same moment that the tip of the drying pole came down directly before his nose.

2586
02:56:27.62 --> 02:56:32.62
The breathing of the two combatants grew louder than the sound of the waves.

2587
02:56:32.62 --> 02:56:39.62
Now the wooden sword was extended at eye level. The drying pole high above its bearers head.

2588
02:56:39.62 --> 02:56:45.62
Ghanru had bounded about ten pieces away where he had the seed on side.

2589
02:56:45.62 --> 02:56:52.62
Though he had not succeeded in injuring Musashi in his first attack, he had put himself in a much better position.

2590
02:56:52.62 --> 02:57:04.62
Had he remained where he was, the sun reflecting from the water into his eyes, his vision would soon have faltered than his spirit, and he would have been at Musashi's mercy.

2591
02:57:04.62 --> 02:57:16.62
With renewed confidence, Ghanru began inching forward, keeping a sharp eye out for a chinkin Musashi's defense and stealing his own spirit for a decisive move.

2592
02:57:16.62 --> 02:57:31.62
Musashi did the unexpected. Instead of proceeding slowly and cautiously, he strode boldly toward Ghanru, his sword projecting before him, ready to thrust into Ghanru's eyes.

2593
02:57:31.62 --> 02:57:39.62
The artlessness of this approach brought Ghanru to a halt. He almost lost sight of Musashi.

2594
02:57:39.62 --> 02:57:51.62
The wooden sword rose straight in the air, with one great kick, Musashi leapt high and folding his legs reduced his six foot frame to four feet or less.

2595
02:57:51.62 --> 02:58:05.62
Ghanru's sword screamed through the space above him. The stroke missed, but the tip of the drying pole cut through Musashi's headband, which went flying through the air.

2596
02:58:05.62 --> 02:58:14.62
Ghanru missed a hit for his opponent's head and a smile flitted briefly across his face.

2597
02:58:14.62 --> 02:58:24.62
The next instant, his skull broke like gravel under the blow of Musashi's sword.

2598
02:58:24.62 --> 02:58:41.62
Ghanru lay with a sand met the grass, his face betrayed no consciousness of defeat. Blood streamed from his mouth, but his lips formed a smile of triumph.

2599
02:58:41.62 --> 02:58:57.62
Oh no, Ghanru forgetting himself, Yuama Kabuki jumped up and with him, all his retnue, their faces distorted with shock.

2600
02:58:57.62 --> 02:59:04.62
Then they saw Nagoda, Sado, and Eori sitting calmly and sedately on their benches.

2601
02:59:04.62 --> 02:59:15.62
Shamed, they somehow managed to keep from running forward. They tried to regain a degree of composure, but there was no concealing their grief and delusion.

2602
02:59:15.62 --> 02:59:22.62
Some swallowed hard refusing to believe what they had seen, and their minds went blank.

2603
02:59:22.62 --> 02:59:36.62
In instant, the island was quiet and still as it had ever been. Only the rustle of the pines and the swaying grasses mocked the frailty and the impermanence of mankind.

2604
02:59:36.62 --> 02:59:40.62
Musashi was watching a small cloud in the sky.

2605
02:59:40.62 --> 02:59:56.62
As he did, his soul returned to his body, and it became possible for him to distinguish between the cloud and himself, between his body and the universe.

2606
02:59:56.62 --> 03:00:10.62
Sasaki, Kajiro, Ghanru did not return to the world of the living. Lying face down, he still had a grip on his sword. His tenacity was still visible.

2607
03:00:10.62 --> 03:00:22.62
There was no sign of anguish on his face. Nothing but satisfaction at having fought a good fight, not the faintest shadow of regretting.

2608
03:00:22.62 --> 03:00:29.62
The sight of his own headband lying on the ground sent shivers up and down Musashi's spine.

2609
03:00:29.62 --> 03:00:36.62
Never in this life he thought, would he meet another opponent like this?

2610
03:00:36.62 --> 03:00:46.62
A wave of admiration and respect flowed over him. He was grateful to Kajiro for what the man had given him.

2611
03:00:46.62 --> 03:00:59.62
In strength, in the will to fight he ranked higher than Musashi. And it was because of this that Musashi had been forced to excel himself.

2612
03:00:59.62 --> 03:01:05.62
What was it that an enabled Musashi to defeat Kajiro?

2613
03:01:05.62 --> 03:01:16.62
Skill, the help of the gods, while knowing it was neither of these, Musashi was never able to express a reason in words.

2614
03:01:16.62 --> 03:01:22.62
Certainly, it was something more important than either strength or godly providence.

2615
03:01:22.62 --> 03:01:29.62
Kajiro had put his confidence in the sword of strength and skill.

2616
03:01:29.62 --> 03:01:37.62
Musashi trusted in the sword of spirit. That was the only difference between them.

2617
03:01:37.62 --> 03:01:43.62
Silently, Musashi walked the ten paces to Kajiro and knelt beside him.

2618
03:01:43.62 --> 03:01:51.62
He put his left hand near the maustrels of Kajiro and found there was no trace of breath.

2619
03:01:51.62 --> 03:01:59.62
With the right treatment he may recover, Musashi told himself, and he wanted to believe this.

2620
03:01:59.62 --> 03:02:07.62
Wanted to believe that this most of valiant of all adversaries would be spared.

2621
03:02:07.62 --> 03:02:12.62
But the battle was over. It was time to go.

2622
03:02:12.62 --> 03:02:19.62
Farewell, he said to Kajiro, then to the officials on their beat benches.

2623
03:02:19.62 --> 03:02:25.62
Having bowed once to the ground, he ran to the reef and jumped into the boat.

2624
03:02:25.62 --> 03:02:28.62
There was not a drop of blood on his wooden sword.

2625
03:02:28.62 --> 03:02:32.62
The tiny craft moved out to see.

2626
03:02:32.62 --> 03:02:43.62
Who is to say where? There is no record as to whether Ghanru's supporters on Hiko Jima attempted to take revenge.

2627
03:02:43.62 --> 03:02:49.62
People do not give up their loves and hates as long as life lasts.

2628
03:02:49.62 --> 03:02:54.62
Waves of feeling come and go with the passage of time.

2629
03:02:54.62 --> 03:02:59.62
Throughout Musashi's lifetime there were those who resented his victory

2630
03:02:59.62 --> 03:03:03.62
and criticized his conduct on that day.

2631
03:03:03.62 --> 03:03:10.62
He rushed away, it was said because he feared reprisal. He was confused.

2632
03:03:10.62 --> 03:03:16.62
He even neglected to administer the Kudagra.

2633
03:03:16.62 --> 03:03:22.62
The world is always full of the sound of waves.

2634
03:03:22.62 --> 03:03:32.62
The little fishes abandoning themselves to the waves, dance and sing and play.

2635
03:03:32.62 --> 03:03:37.62
But who knows the heart of the sea, a hundred feet down?

2636
03:03:37.62 --> 03:03:49.62
Who knows its depth?

2637
03:03:49.62 --> 03:03:54.62
The end?

2638
03:03:54.62 --> 03:04:03.62
That is how the book finishes up.

2639
03:04:03.62 --> 03:04:10.62
Who knows the heart of the sea?

2640
03:04:10.62 --> 03:04:19.62
Who knows its depth?

2641
03:04:19.62 --> 03:04:27.62
And as I read that, I wonder to myself,

2642
03:04:27.62 --> 03:04:33.62
are we just the little fishes?

2643
03:04:33.62 --> 03:04:43.62
Abandoning ourselves to the waves to sing and dance and play?

2644
03:04:43.62 --> 03:04:47.62
Is that what we're doing?

2645
03:04:47.62 --> 03:04:50.62
And I'm not saying don't have fun.

2646
03:04:50.62 --> 03:04:53.62
I'm not saying don't sing and dance and play.

2647
03:04:53.62 --> 03:05:00.62
Enjoy life, of course, and relish the joy of life.

2648
03:05:00.62 --> 03:05:07.62
But I think you have to make sure you don't dance your life away.

2649
03:05:07.62 --> 03:05:14.62
Don't be one of the little fishes.

2650
03:05:14.62 --> 03:05:21.62
And in Dukoto, that final writing of Musashi before he died,

2651
03:05:21.62 --> 03:05:31.62
the last thing he wrote was never stray from the way.

2652
03:05:31.62 --> 03:05:39.62
And I think that that's what this is about.

2653
03:05:39.62 --> 03:05:46.62
All the fun and the singing and the dancing and all the play, it's okay.

2654
03:05:46.62 --> 03:05:50.62
It's good.

2655
03:05:50.62 --> 03:05:57.62
But all those things can be distractions.

2656
03:05:59.62 --> 03:06:06.62
Because there is a path, there is a way.

2657
03:06:06.62 --> 03:06:16.62
And you know what that way is, you know what you should be doing.

2658
03:06:16.62 --> 03:06:24.62
And it's hard to stay on that path because it is the path of discipline.

2659
03:06:24.62 --> 03:06:29.62
And discomfort, but it is the right path.

2660
03:06:29.62 --> 03:06:34.62
And you know that.

2661
03:06:34.62 --> 03:06:45.62
And it is that path that will ultimately lead you to where you really want to be.

2662
03:06:45.62 --> 03:06:52.62
So that you can live.

2663
03:06:52.62 --> 03:07:04.62
And you can die without regrets.

2664
03:07:04.62 --> 03:07:10.62
I think a lot of times, people are trying to find the path.

2665
03:07:10.62 --> 03:07:17.62
And they're looking all around different places and different people and different influences.

2666
03:07:17.62 --> 03:07:23.62
But man, I think so often that path, you know what the path is and people know what they're supposed to be doing.

2667
03:07:23.62 --> 03:07:28.62
But they just don't get on the path and stay on the path.

2668
03:07:28.62 --> 03:07:29.62
Yeah, I agree.

2669
03:07:29.62 --> 03:07:33.62
Or something they felt when they were eight or twelve.

2670
03:07:33.62 --> 03:07:42.62
And they travel the world or travel through life's experiences trying to find the answer that was in front of them the entire time.

2671
03:07:42.62 --> 03:07:51.62
And so they come back to see what they knew with different eyes and to recognize that they knew the path all along.

2672
03:07:51.62 --> 03:08:02.62
Which is something that I so enjoyed about this book and the character, both real and certainly presented by the author.

2673
03:08:02.62 --> 03:08:15.62
The author of Musashi, who is using his experiences in this domain of the sword as a means of thematic interconnectedness.

2674
03:08:15.62 --> 03:08:23.62
And so unlike Cogito at the end, he is not just a technician with the sword.

2675
03:08:23.62 --> 03:08:38.62
Although he is a brilliant technician, he's telling the soil he's constructing buildings, which later he did quite a lot of in terms of architecture and overseeing the building instead of destruction of things.

2676
03:08:38.62 --> 03:08:52.62
And finding at the highest levels of performance with the sword in filling opponents the principles, the first principles that he can apply everywhere.

2677
03:08:52.62 --> 03:09:00.62
And that's part of what fascinates me so much about Musashi or anyone who's the best of what they do is that it could be anything.

2678
03:09:00.62 --> 03:09:06.62
It could be pottery, it could be sniping, it could be calligraphy, but like the best.

2679
03:09:06.62 --> 03:09:10.62
They see the depth.

2680
03:09:10.62 --> 03:09:19.62
They see the interwoven web that can expand from that one fine focus into everything that they do.

2681
03:09:19.62 --> 03:09:28.62
And I think that for me at least is the path and maybe it's just coming off of a silent retreat that I want to talk this way.

2682
03:09:28.62 --> 03:09:37.62
But it doesn't strike me as something that is cleanly expressed in an Instagram post or a quote necessarily.

2683
03:09:37.62 --> 03:09:46.62
It's more of a feeling like you know if you're sober and take a moment to sit in the stillness.

2684
03:09:46.62 --> 03:09:49.62
And by stillness, I don't mean sitting on a mountain top.

2685
03:09:49.62 --> 03:10:00.62
It could just be five minutes of silence when you first get up in the morning and observe your own mind and how you feel like you know if you're on the path or not.

2686
03:10:00.62 --> 03:10:02.62
Or at least you know when you're not on it.

2687
03:10:02.62 --> 03:10:04.62
Totally agree.

2688
03:10:04.62 --> 03:10:06.62
You know, you know when you're not on it.

2689
03:10:06.62 --> 03:10:15.62
And I think that the feeling of being on it when you're on the path, it has that beauty of.

2690
03:10:15.62 --> 03:10:24.62
Mindlessness or no mind, as what they would say, and say Zen, the state of no mind.

2691
03:10:24.62 --> 03:10:27.62
And it sounds like unconscious, but it's different. It's not unconscious.

2692
03:10:27.62 --> 03:10:36.62
It's not subconscious. It's something else where you feel that you're exactly where you should be doing exactly what you should be doing.

2693
03:10:36.62 --> 03:10:44.62
And you're not planning you're just putting one foot front of the other on this path that you didn't have to find because in a way.

2694
03:10:44.62 --> 03:10:47.62
The path was seeking you the whole time.

2695
03:10:47.62 --> 03:10:56.62
And it's just a feeling. It's a really, it's a feeling I think that everyone can have, but they get so caught up.

2696
03:10:56.62 --> 03:11:01.62
We all get caught up. I want to speak for YouTube, find Jansel, speak for myself.

2697
03:11:01.62 --> 03:11:05.62
It's easy to get caught up in the noise and the shiny objects.

2698
03:11:05.62 --> 03:11:10.62
And just like the little fish you were talking about earlier.

2699
03:11:10.62 --> 03:11:18.62
It's like when you see that lure to recognize it as a lure is sort of the first step.

2700
03:11:18.62 --> 03:11:24.62
And then to realize that when you look past the lure, there's a lure, 16 inches in front of you,

2701
03:11:24.62 --> 03:11:31.62
and then you're in an ocean that has endless fathoms of death.

2702
03:11:31.62 --> 03:11:33.62
What a journey.

2703
03:11:33.62 --> 03:11:40.62
Yeah, the same, the line that says the world is always filled with the sound of waves.

2704
03:11:40.62 --> 03:11:44.62
It's like, yeah, those sounds are going on in the waves or out there.

2705
03:11:44.62 --> 03:11:48.62
And there's little fishy swimming around in the waves.

2706
03:11:48.62 --> 03:11:49.62
Yeah.

2707
03:11:49.62 --> 03:11:58.62
Well, you, and I think you've experienced this type of, that type of clarity in many different contexts.

2708
03:11:58.62 --> 03:12:03.62
I haven't served much, but I have done a bit, certainly not as regularly as you have.

2709
03:12:03.62 --> 03:12:12.62
But the feeling of when I've been out in surf that suddenly exceeded my capacities,

2710
03:12:12.62 --> 03:12:18.62
which is also not necessarily something I recommend, but I've had this harrowing experience,

2711
03:12:18.62 --> 03:12:26.62
particularly as someone who didn't learn to swim until I was in my 30s, which is a whole separate thing that I think we covered in episode 50.

2712
03:12:26.62 --> 03:12:40.62
I have fear related to the ocean, which I think is healthy on a lot of levels, but when you're out there and suddenly sets come in that are 70% 100% bigger than what you went in with.

2713
03:12:40.62 --> 03:12:47.62
The feeling of, or just sitting calmly on your board waiting for a set and looking out over the water,

2714
03:12:47.62 --> 03:12:55.62
the sense of insignificance that you feel is not a, at least that I feel, it's not a negative thing.

2715
03:12:55.62 --> 03:13:02.62
It's a very, has to use the word, but I can't find the better one.

2716
03:13:02.62 --> 03:13:07.62
Spiritual experience, really. Oh yeah, that email.

2717
03:13:07.62 --> 03:13:16.62
That comment on social media, that commitment I made to go to an event that I read out really six months later, don't want to go to.

2718
03:13:16.62 --> 03:13:20.62
Who gives a fuck? It's like a robuncha monkeys on a spinning rock.

2719
03:13:20.62 --> 03:13:30.62
Yeah, in the middle of this whole thing, whatever this whole thing is. And all that thing is singing and dancing and playing, and it's like compared to the depths of the ocean, it means nothing.

2720
03:13:30.62 --> 03:13:32.62
Yeah, nothing.

2721
03:13:32.62 --> 03:13:46.62
Yeah, it's, it's, it's, I just, I love the purity of, despite his stupidity, let's be honest, right?

2722
03:13:46.62 --> 03:13:51.62
We already talked about it like he made us, a lot of stupid decisions, storming the jail.

2723
03:13:51.62 --> 03:14:02.62
I mean, what do you, what do you think's going to have? And so on and so forth, but despite all that coming back to what he knew, one of the few things that he felt,

2724
03:14:02.62 --> 03:14:07.62
I shouldn't say no, felt to be true to him, which was this commitment to the way of the sword.

2725
03:14:07.62 --> 03:14:14.62
And it doesn't have to be a commitment to the way of the sword, but I've always had a certain envy for people, including yourself,

2726
03:14:14.62 --> 03:14:28.62
who from a very, very early age, just felt, a beacon for a direction that called the really lucky, I feel like I was really lucky in that aspect.

2727
03:14:28.62 --> 03:14:40.62
Well, you made people, I've met, for instance, Laird Hamilton, I mentioned it earlier, it's like he still serves every day, wakes up at four, stoked to go out and train.

2728
03:14:40.62 --> 03:14:58.62
And he's on the path, he's on the path. And I mean, this is a guy who he was with, I mean, he's out there with large tiger sharks, which are routinely out, where he serves in Hawaii, where he spends a good portion of the year.

2729
03:14:58.62 --> 03:15:03.62
And I've heard stories and these are real, these are not several hundred years later in Bellish stories.

2730
03:15:03.62 --> 03:15:16.62
The story, just a real story, as someone was bitten by a tiger shark, bleeding out, he went back to a jet ski that they had, oh, it took off at some piece of clothing he had, put in,

2731
03:15:16.62 --> 03:15:29.62
make shift turnic it on this guy, who's bleeding in the water with tiger sharks, keep mine's already been, the key has been lost to the jet ski, hot wires the jet ski, and brings the guy back and saves it.

2732
03:15:29.62 --> 03:15:39.62
And I'd say every few months he saves someone's life in the water, and he's in his 50s, you're sitting in a steam room at one point.

2733
03:15:39.62 --> 03:15:46.62
And I, in retrospect, realized not a good idea to try to outlast Laird and a steam room.

2734
03:15:46.62 --> 03:15:54.62
But he was saying, roughly, along these lines, like 20, once it's 20 feet, you can start to have fun, start to play around.

2735
03:15:54.62 --> 03:16:06.62
Because 20 to 30, yeah, you're really jamming, 30 to 40, you can definitely get into the zone, he's like above 50, you're not allowed to fall.

2736
03:16:06.62 --> 03:16:16.62
And that's his day, and he has kids, but as far as I can tell, Gabby, who's just incredible, incredible on so many levels in her own, right?

2737
03:16:16.62 --> 03:16:26.62
She understands, like, this is his path, he's still chasing giants, and he's not going to stop, how could he, like, that's part of who he is.

2738
03:16:26.62 --> 03:16:32.62
What do you think draws people, like, in the wrong direction in their life?

2739
03:16:32.62 --> 03:16:40.62
I think it's just a little distraction, so as you talk about echo, it's a little distraction, there's little things that just pull you off.

2740
03:16:40.62 --> 03:16:48.62
And I think maybe people don't want to accept the fact, like, they know what the path is, but they want to deny it for whatever reason.

2741
03:16:48.62 --> 03:16:58.62
I think that's, I think that can be part of it, the distraction of the path.

2742
03:16:58.62 --> 03:17:05.62
I mean, I will say, for this people out there, like, well, forgot to say, like, I don't know what my path is, I can't define it.

2743
03:17:05.62 --> 03:17:17.62
I don't know if I could say to someone with absolute conviction, my path is ex, but I can tell when I've strayed, if that makes sense.

2744
03:17:17.62 --> 03:17:32.62
There's a certain agitation, there's a certain scattered feeling that I have, and as to reasons people get off the path, and I think people may have multiple paths, but you're going to say,

2745
03:17:32.62 --> 03:17:40.62
that was going to say, because I've been, I'm trying to formulate what we're talking about, because I know exactly what you mean.

2746
03:17:40.62 --> 03:17:46.62
Like, like, the path is, it might not be like, I want to do this thing, like, there's something else.

2747
03:17:46.62 --> 03:17:54.62
And I think it, I think the something else is, the path is how you are going to live.

2748
03:17:54.62 --> 03:18:08.62
Yeah, that's not necessarily a destination, that you could, you could follow the same path and get to a bunch of different destinations, but the path itself of how you're going to live, how you're going to go through life, how you're going to do things.

2749
03:18:08.62 --> 03:18:20.62
That's, that's what I'm talking about, and even the path that I'm on could have led to other things in my life, and even though, you know, I was in the military for 20 years, I'm not in the military anymore.

2750
03:18:20.62 --> 03:18:27.62
I'm still on the same path, like the path is the same of the way I'm trying to live my life. That's the same.

2751
03:18:27.62 --> 03:18:33.62
And if I'm in, I'm in business, the way I run my business, I'm trying, I'm on the same path.

2752
03:18:33.62 --> 03:18:43.62
It's, so the path, it's like the way you're living your life more than anything else, and it doesn't matter if you're in college, if you're starting a business, if you're working for someone,

2753
03:18:43.62 --> 03:18:51.62
are you on the path that you're supposed to be on? Are you living the way that you feel you're supposed to live, that you know you're supposed to live?

2754
03:18:51.62 --> 03:18:56.62
I think people get off that, they get off that, and they're not living the way that they know they should live.

2755
03:18:56.62 --> 03:19:04.62
Regardless of circumstances, you've been in horrible circumstances before. We all go, situations where things just went sideways,

2756
03:19:04.62 --> 03:19:13.62
and you can either stray off the path and turn into something that you're not or something that you know you shouldn't be, or you can stay on the path.

2757
03:19:13.62 --> 03:19:19.62
You can continue to do the things that you're supposed to do and live the way that you want to live.

2758
03:19:19.62 --> 03:19:27.62
And really, lately I've been talking about, because I've been trying to explain this, you know what the right thing to do is.

2759
03:19:27.62 --> 03:19:35.62
You know what you're supposed to do as a person, as you, you know what you're supposed to do. Do it. Do that thing.

2760
03:19:35.62 --> 03:19:45.62
What is that thing that you're supposed to live a certain way? And when you don't live that way, like you said, there's friction and there's tension and there's disruption,

2761
03:19:45.62 --> 03:19:52.62
and it doesn't feel right. And when you live the right way, it's often hargur, it often is less immediate gratification.

2762
03:19:52.62 --> 03:20:00.62
But the internal gratification that you get from living the way you're supposed to live is very satisfying.

2763
03:20:00.62 --> 03:20:14.62
And another thing I need to absolutely point out is, I am by no means sitting here trying to say that I've always maintained the worst human ever. I'm horrible.

2764
03:20:14.62 --> 03:20:26.62
And you know, I was on with a guy named Charlie Plum came on the podcast and a guy named Jim Kim Conkel. Charlie Plum was a Vietnam fighter pilot shot down, spent six years in the Hanoy Hilton.

2765
03:20:26.62 --> 03:20:42.62
And another guy named Jim Conkel who was a fighter pilot in World War II. And we got in this conversation like about, you know, doing good and these guys are just levels infinite levels above me as far as being good people.

2766
03:20:42.62 --> 03:21:00.62
And I kind of went along with the conversation. Almost as if I was one of their, like had that level of goodness, which I don't, you know, I mean, I'm trying, but you know, when I was a young seal, I was a maniac, you know, I made Mousashi look like a brilliant saint with his youth.

2767
03:21:00.62 --> 03:21:23.62
And I'm crazy, maniac kid filled with just mayhem in my brain. And all my friends, we were all the same and we got after it. And so believe me, I'm not trying to say that, but I will say that as I've grown up, I've, I've think I've got myself closer to living the way that I know I'm supposed to live or I, the what I believe to be the right way and the right path to be on.

2768
03:21:23.62 --> 03:21:36.62
And, you know, so I just wanted to make that quick caveat that anybody that's listening that's like, oh, how joccal is really just a saintly person wrong. I'm not even remotely making that claim.

2769
03:21:36.62 --> 03:21:40.62
But I am trying, I'll give myself at least that much credit.

2770
03:21:40.62 --> 03:22:02.62
I think that everyone is a work in progress and that the path, so to speak, is illustrated for me in this book, and I'll get into a couple of specifics. It might be helpful for people to think about or at least have been helpful to me as I think through.

2771
03:22:02.62 --> 03:22:14.62
I think which is the relative lack of friction and the scatteredness and agitation versus states without those things.

2772
03:22:14.62 --> 03:22:29.62
Because being on the path is not necessarily for me, a feeling of overwhelming joy and happiness per se. It's, it's a lack of

2773
03:22:29.62 --> 03:22:44.62
success, agitation and destructiveness. And I think that what, what I've found for myself is that as I get older and feel more at peace with what I'm doing and how I'm behaving.

2774
03:22:44.62 --> 03:22:58.62
Like you said, it's having certain first principles in mind that transcend any given project, any given conversation, anyone relationship and early on. It's

2775
03:22:58.62 --> 03:23:20.62
that you're hoping to define yourself or find yourself or build yourself. You are very often succumb because how could you not to pursuing shiny object after shiny object. And in the beginning, I think that's fine and even for a very long period of time, you throw a lot against the wall to see what sticks and to discover what you're good at, what you're terrible at, what your weaknesses are, what your strengths are.

2776
03:23:20.62 --> 03:23:30.62
But over time, whether you're looking at some of the most successful investors in the world like Ray Dalia of Bridgewater Associates, they manage 160 billion dollars at last count.

2777
03:23:30.62 --> 03:23:42.62
And or athletes like Marcel La Garcia who will not train a technique that he cannot use on a 300 pound muscular opponent. He just will not train.

2778
03:23:42.62 --> 03:23:52.62
He does not, he does not drill techniques that he cannot apply to someone twice his size. And these are principles, right, whether it's safe.

2779
03:23:52.62 --> 03:24:08.62
And you can take principles from one domain and transplant them, which is why I think this book is such an excellent illustration of the value of becoming exceptionally exceptionally good at something in a very very narrow band.

2780
03:24:08.62 --> 03:24:18.62
And because when you do that, the constitution and the frameworks and the principles that you develop for yourself can then be applied everywhere.

2781
03:24:18.62 --> 03:24:36.62
So in Judges who, let's just say, and I'm talking about my ass a little bit, since certainly don't feel qualified to speak too much on Judges who is stable, but if you take something like position before submission, right, let's just say for whatever reason you adopt that and that's worked very well for you.

2782
03:24:36.62 --> 03:24:59.62
You can apply that to a lot, right, you can apply that to a lot of things. And when you start to really think about precepts and principles and the dock godo that last short book or treat us of misaches is it's in a fact, a bolded list of precepts.

2783
03:24:59.62 --> 03:25:19.62
And pretty tough to follow all of them all at the same time, by the way, if you read them. But if you just have a few and they can be very plain, very much plain speech, let's just say it's say what you mean me what you say.

2784
03:25:19.62 --> 03:25:35.62
Do what you say you're going to do all on time. I mean very simple, right, and then you have a recipe book you have an algorithm which is really just a step, a set of steps that produce a given no and predetermined outcome usually.

2785
03:25:35.62 --> 03:25:49.62
If you follow those, you can start to mold and define this path, your way of moving through the world interacting with the world. But if you're stuck in say

2786
03:25:49.62 --> 03:26:16.62
the weather patterns of the world instead of looking at sort of the tectonic plate level and you're focused on these things it change very very quickly like the news cycle like what your friends are saying on social media at all times. The fear of missing out in social expectations that are set that make you want to posture because all of your friends are putting highlights of their lives on the internet, which makes you feel like a failure because it's not all glamour shots.

2787
03:26:16.62 --> 03:26:30.62
Those are all just shifting weather patterns, they mean nothing and you just you should let those pass as they say in this book it comes up a lot as much as froth.

2788
03:26:30.62 --> 03:26:51.62
That comes up a lot in misogy and flies, right, froth and flies and insects. He's passing phenomena versus thinking about in his case he uses the mountains and so on, but the lower levels that tend to be less.

2789
03:26:51.62 --> 03:27:09.62
They're less sexy they don't move as quickly, but if you understand those slower moving and spike extensions, timeless principles and you can use those to carve and form and find rediscovered your own path.

2790
03:27:09.62 --> 03:27:34.62
Then I think it just gives you much greater level of peace in part because it gives you much greater level of agency you feel like you can craft your experience of life as opposed to being tossed back and forth by the vagaries of fast changing factors you have no control over.

2791
03:27:34.62 --> 03:27:45.62
Well, I suppose we could talk about this indefinitely, but we're using up too much bandwidth already.

2792
03:27:45.62 --> 03:27:57.62
Echo speaking of the path. Do you have any recommendations of maybe how people could stay on the path and you know, maybe even support sure.

2793
03:27:57.62 --> 03:28:08.62
Real quick though, it's far as pronunciation goes when there's like a double consonant you kind of say them both like like this Dakota you say, don't code.

2794
03:28:08.62 --> 03:28:20.62
Yeah, there's a little stutter in it. Yeah, yeah, because it's almost like you got to finish the first K and then start the second K. Yeah, it's it's it's it's kind of a I think it would be considered with a call like a lot of all stops.

2795
03:28:20.62 --> 03:28:36.62
Like Hokkaido and Japan is actually Hokkaido, right, right, but if there was only one K, be Hokkaido. That's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're school took me a long time just get which was really embarrassing in the beginning working on my pronunciation.

2796
03:28:36.62 --> 03:28:49.62
I had to say the word school a lot. I was going to school walking to school. When are you going to school and it's got goal, which has that little stutter and man did I mess that up.

2797
03:28:49.62 --> 03:29:07.62
Cast a broader apology to all of my my Japanese friends especially go crazy. I'm sorry. It's interesting that you care because in in the Hawaiian language, they put it. It's actually considered another letter. It's called the Okina. It's basically an apostrophe.

2798
03:29:07.62 --> 03:29:25.62
Yeah, and that you in Hawaii, there's a lot of vowels go together. Right. So when you want when you want to do that little function to separate them, you put the Okina there like like the word Hawaii, Hawaii, there's two eyes of Dan. So you say Hawaii, remember you're asking me, oh, I say, how do you say, quiet, how do you say quiet, it quiet, I think technically it's quiet.

2799
03:29:25.62 --> 03:29:51.62
People typically don't say, go out anymore. That's a whole lot of very very similar. But similar deal, right? Similar deal. If this was with consonant straight out, I don't want to take us too far field, but there are some really weird similarities between Japanese and other languages where there may have been trade routes established for the dawn of man in weird places.

2800
03:29:51.62 --> 03:30:04.62
So there are some commonalities in pollination languages. And then you also find incredible commonalities with Turkish all languages. Yeah, nearly identical, grammar.

2801
03:30:04.62 --> 03:30:20.62
I don't know, I was taking linguistic classes and they would point out these weird weird commonalities that you say, well, that's, you know, like things that like the number one things like the sun things that, you know, everyone kind of has to have created a word for it.

2802
03:30:20.62 --> 03:30:28.62
Some point, yeah, there's definitely some strings and I forget what they are. I didn't study hard enough. I wasn't on the path.

2803
03:30:28.62 --> 03:30:56.62
But a lot of these languages like the, you know, even the pronunciation of like, A is A. You know, Japanese Hawaiian. Yeah, you know, all the very soft vowels typically. Yeah, A E O O. Yeah. And then the eyes like E. Yeah, Japanese people can handle Spanish is probably the closest that I've seen language that they can handle any language that ends on consonants a lot is going to be so.

2804
03:30:56.62 --> 03:31:06.62
Remember, they've such tough time. They add the you at the end. Yeah, the team. Yeah, if they say like B or yeah, be it or not, but be it or make Donald's is Machudo, not at them.

2805
03:31:06.62 --> 03:31:20.62
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then they have a tough time, but the, and for those people wondering the reason they can't or have so much trouble distinguishing between ours and else, which many other Asian people do not.

2806
03:31:20.62 --> 03:31:46.62
But in the case of Japanese is because they have a blended phoneme of blended sound. It's a combination of R, L, and D. So naughty, dude. It's how they say it. So that do that like sound is not clearly distinguished into multiple consonants in Japanese, which is why they've so much trouble with ours and else, but you can teach them to fix that in a few minutes if you explain how the tongue is positioned.

2807
03:31:46.62 --> 03:31:59.62
And I remember at one point, give credit to my first Japanese teacher, Mr. Shimano, who was fantastic because we would hit a sticking point in class.

2808
03:31:59.62 --> 03:32:09.62
We'd be going over some concept. There was really difficult for a native English speakers brain to wrap itself around like they have subject markers and the difference between why and God.

2809
03:32:09.62 --> 03:32:29.62
And if it's known to the speakers, if it's not known to the speakers, that and you're like, what does that mean? And he could sense because I transferred from a very weak school, very bad school along I learned to very highly competitive school in New Hampshire that had classes six days a week.

2810
03:32:29.62 --> 03:32:44.62
Mandatory seated meal like dead poets, a society mandatory sports classes from 8 a.m. or so to about 6 p.m. and the Japanese class was very often the class after sports people wiped out hadn't had dinner.

2811
03:32:44.62 --> 03:32:52.62
And we'd be struggling and getting agitated with some aspect of Japanese and you could tell that we were losing it.

2812
03:32:52.62 --> 03:33:00.62
We still had 45 minutes to go. So it's all right. Had a really strong Japanese accent and you'd be like, we're going to stop for a minute.

2813
03:33:00.62 --> 03:33:06.62
And I'm going to attempt to say this word for you and you would write squirrel on the blackboard.

2814
03:33:06.62 --> 03:33:12.62
If you want to talk about a word, there would be designed to be crypto-night for Japanese person.

2815
03:33:12.62 --> 03:33:32.62
And so you would take like five minutes for just comedic effect to just go squirrel squirrel squirrel. I mean, do that for like two minutes and we crack up and loosen up and realize, okay, everyone who's learning a new language has some type of sticking point like this and then he'd be like, okay enough fun and games now back to the hard stuff.

2816
03:33:32.62 --> 03:33:35.62
Is an excellent excellent teacher.

2817
03:33:35.62 --> 03:33:43.62
It's legit speaking of hard stuff. Speak quick, my brother please for the love of God.

2818
03:33:43.62 --> 03:33:47.62
Oh, good. I was going to talk more about your retreat, but we can talk about that later.

2819
03:33:47.62 --> 03:33:57.62
In the meantime, when take care of our joints or gin main.com is a good spot to get these joint supplements, jocosupplements.

2820
03:33:57.62 --> 03:34:01.62
Super krill oil. Not just regular krill oil. Super krill oil.

2821
03:34:01.62 --> 03:34:14.62
Yeah, krill oil upstairs actually. Boom. There you go. Also another one called jocco joint warfare. It's a blend of joint degeneration warfare weapons.

2822
03:34:14.62 --> 03:34:20.62
Jack technically. Also for some legit fitness gear if you're into kettle eunuch kettle bells.

2823
03:34:20.62 --> 03:34:25.62
Yeah, I have some in my garage here. It's the only fitness tools I have right now are two kettle bells.

2824
03:34:25.62 --> 03:34:29.62
Boom. There you go. Boom. I got my arm on it.

2825
03:34:29.62 --> 03:34:33.62
Yeah, squat. I go to a gym for that right now, but yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2826
03:34:33.62 --> 03:34:39.62
Okay. But kettle bells are dope. Yeah. Especially the ones from on it by the way, where Wolf gorilla.

2827
03:34:39.62 --> 03:34:43.62
Big foot, chimp. I'm just listing the ones I thought.

2828
03:34:43.62 --> 03:34:47.62
I thought you were a person that you're telling me, call me names. So I thought you're trying out new names for me.

2829
03:34:47.62 --> 03:34:50.62
No, no. Those are kettle bells I have, you know that artistic ones.

2830
03:34:50.62 --> 03:34:53.62
Oh, yeah, the dope ones. Did you say artistic or autistic artists?

2831
03:34:53.62 --> 03:34:59.62
I'm just kidding. It's just messing with you. I don't think they're autistic at all.

2832
03:34:59.62 --> 03:35:05.62
But they are dope though. Yeah. You're the regular ones. I have the eye. So we're sitting here in Austin, Texas.

2833
03:35:05.62 --> 03:35:10.62
Not too far from on at HQ and I actually bought two of the standard issue.

2834
03:35:10.62 --> 03:35:15.62
I know. You like me. Yeah. Just cut. Not much. Cut.

2835
03:35:15.62 --> 03:35:18.62
Yeah. The decorations and just go.

2836
03:35:18.62 --> 03:35:25.62
They got some new start words. Yeah. Yeah. The Darth Vader one. The Darth Vader one school. Yeah. I've seen it.

2837
03:35:25.62 --> 03:35:30.62
You got to kind of admit it after a while. You're like, okay. I mean me. I don't care. I'm like, hey, come to my house.

2838
03:35:30.62 --> 03:35:33.62
See my kettle bells. Yeah. They're dope. But some people, jocca. They're like, no, you know.

2839
03:35:33.62 --> 03:35:37.62
Yeah. Once they say hard core, but you got to admit it. I'm more of Boba Fekka myself.

2840
03:35:37.62 --> 03:35:41.62
But yeah. I do like Darth Vader. Yeah. Check those out. Anyway.

2841
03:35:41.62 --> 03:35:44.62
On it. I'm not going to call them. They got other stuff on there too.

2842
03:35:44.62 --> 03:35:52.62
Pretty much for any kind of workout other than what? Like your typical gym workout.

2843
03:35:52.62 --> 03:35:56.62
Like they have maces and whatnot. So anyway, go there on it. Yeah.

2844
03:35:56.62 --> 03:36:00.62
Just as a side note for people listening.

2845
03:36:00.62 --> 03:36:05.62
Don't let the head. All right. I've had enough caffeine. I've been off the caffeine for 10 days.

2846
03:36:05.62 --> 03:36:13.62
So we've got a lot of personality right now. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good when it comes to working out or home gyms or anything like that.

2847
03:36:13.62 --> 03:36:19.62
Don't say I can't start because I don't have these seven pieces of equipment for two years.

2848
03:36:19.62 --> 03:36:27.62
When I had very little money and was training in jiu-jitsu when I just moved to the Bay Area, which is stupidly expensive.

2849
03:36:27.62 --> 03:36:32.62
I had roommates and no space whatsoever. I had one 53 pound kettlebell.

2850
03:36:32.62 --> 03:36:38.62
And I did everything with that kettlebell. I did. And I got into that combined with jiu-jitsu.

2851
03:36:38.62 --> 03:36:43.62
That's all I had space for with one kettlebell. I got into some of the best shape of my entire life.

2852
03:36:43.62 --> 03:36:46.62
Yeah. You know, like kettlebell 53 pounds. That's nothing. It's like okay.

2853
03:36:46.62 --> 03:36:48.62
Do 20 pistols. Yeah.

2854
03:36:48.62 --> 03:36:53.62
With 15 you pounder. Yeah. As you're done. Yeah. Let's see if you can do one review through your pounder.

2855
03:36:53.62 --> 03:36:53.62
Yeah. Yeah.

2856
03:36:53.62 --> 03:36:56.62
Because a lot of people can't even do one pistol with a 53 pounder.

2857
03:36:56.62 --> 03:36:59.62
Yeah. That's like the goal. Yeah.

2858
03:36:59.62 --> 03:36:59.62
Yeah.

2859
03:36:59.62 --> 03:37:05.62
And I was, I don't want to say I was against kettlebells before, but you know when they first kind of came on the scene here.

2860
03:37:05.62 --> 03:37:09.62
Yeah. And then people were like, yeah kettlebells. And look how cool we are.

2861
03:37:09.62 --> 03:37:12.62
You know how like when people do that, you kind of build this kind of natural relationship.

2862
03:37:12.62 --> 03:37:15.62
Not resentment, but just some resistance.

2863
03:37:15.62 --> 03:37:15.62
Yeah.

2864
03:37:15.62 --> 03:37:18.62
Like I'm not going to jump on your little band like I see what you're doing.

2865
03:37:18.62 --> 03:37:19.62
You know, I'm going to stick to this.

2866
03:37:19.62 --> 03:37:20.62
Yeah.

2867
03:37:20.62 --> 03:37:24.62
And then finally I got on the boat and kind of shit I got on that earlier.

2868
03:37:24.62 --> 03:37:24.62
Yeah.

2869
03:37:24.62 --> 03:37:30.62
kettlebells. And you don't need to be, I will say, not a doctor don't play one on the internet.

2870
03:37:30.62 --> 03:37:35.62
But just to, uh, to keep joggers liability insurance premiums low.

2871
03:37:35.62 --> 03:37:40.62
Uh, kettlebells don't get too fancy kids with the kettlebells.

2872
03:37:40.62 --> 03:37:44.62
Don't pick up a kettlebell for the first time and try to do snatches.

2873
03:37:44.62 --> 03:37:44.62
Yeah.

2874
03:37:44.62 --> 03:37:47.62
It's a good way to get reconstructive shoulder surgery.

2875
03:37:47.62 --> 03:37:48.62
Yeah.

2876
03:37:48.62 --> 03:37:49.62
You don't need to do a whole lot.

2877
03:37:49.62 --> 03:37:56.62
If you just do two handed kettlebell swings properly, which I would not in my book would not be above the shoulder.

2878
03:37:56.62 --> 03:38:02.62
And you do, let's just say, some Turkish get ups, even partial Turkish get ups.

2879
03:38:02.62 --> 03:38:08.62
And a handful of other exercises, I'm particular to windmills and cosyxquads and so on.

2880
03:38:08.62 --> 03:38:10.62
You really don't need much.

2881
03:38:10.62 --> 03:38:15.62
And you don't have to do potentially dangerous ballistic movements to get a lot out of kettlebells.

2882
03:38:15.62 --> 03:38:16.62
Yeah.

2883
03:38:16.62 --> 03:38:20.62
And I personally would even go further and say, don't do much.

2884
03:38:20.62 --> 03:38:25.62
Especially like the, like Turkish get the snatch to, like these ones where snatch of you take it.

2885
03:38:25.62 --> 03:38:26.62
Yeah.

2886
03:38:26.62 --> 03:38:28.62
If you're trying to like, you see your motor like you can get it.

2887
03:38:28.62 --> 03:38:29.62
And let me get that big one.

2888
03:38:29.62 --> 03:38:30.62
Because it's cool you look at them.

2889
03:38:30.62 --> 03:38:33.62
And this one's like obviously bigger than the other one.

2890
03:38:33.62 --> 03:38:35.62
I can't talk in a very, because I can last them here at my house.

2891
03:38:35.62 --> 03:38:36.62
I was over there, dude.

2892
03:38:36.62 --> 03:38:38.62
Every exercise with the biggest kettlebells.

2893
03:38:38.62 --> 03:38:39.62
Yeah.

2894
03:38:39.62 --> 03:38:39.62
Yeah.

2895
03:38:39.62 --> 03:38:39.62
Yeah.

2896
03:38:39.62 --> 03:38:40.62
So I dig it man.

2897
03:38:40.62 --> 03:38:45.62
But man, if you start doing these snatches or the man, I had to have this big foot one.

2898
03:38:45.62 --> 03:38:46.62
It's 90 pounds.

2899
03:38:46.62 --> 03:38:47.62
Yeah.

2900
03:38:47.62 --> 03:38:52.62
So I can, I mean, now I can boom clean and press one hand.

2901
03:38:52.62 --> 03:38:56.62
I'll go, like, I'll go to this side and to this side and to this, you know, I'll do that.

2902
03:38:56.62 --> 03:39:01.62
And it wasn't, I don't know if I wasn't warm or I just hated it at the wrong angle.

2903
03:39:01.62 --> 03:39:03.62
I got it up to here.

2904
03:39:03.62 --> 03:39:06.62
And then when I pressed it up, I think it was too far back.

2905
03:39:06.62 --> 03:39:06.62
Yeah.

2906
03:39:06.62 --> 03:39:08.62
So it went like when I pressed, it was weird.

2907
03:39:08.62 --> 03:39:09.62
You know how kettlebells, right?

2908
03:39:09.62 --> 03:39:11.62
They dig tang back there.

2909
03:39:11.62 --> 03:39:11.62
Yeah.

2910
03:39:11.62 --> 03:39:14.62
So when I pressed it up, it's almost like it went backwards.

2911
03:39:14.62 --> 03:39:16.62
That's the my shoulder a little bit.

2912
03:39:16.62 --> 03:39:17.62
Yeah.

2913
03:39:17.62 --> 03:39:18.62
Yeah.

2914
03:39:18.62 --> 03:39:20.62
You will be able to press as well as you can clean.

2915
03:39:20.62 --> 03:39:29.62
If you cannot clean a weight extremely smoothly to your side, do not try to press it.

2916
03:39:29.62 --> 03:39:30.62
Yeah.

2917
03:39:30.62 --> 03:39:32.62
And it didn't just be careful there.

2918
03:39:32.62 --> 03:39:33.62
Start the light.

2919
03:39:33.62 --> 03:39:34.62
That's the point, right?

2920
03:39:34.62 --> 03:39:34.62
Yeah.

2921
03:39:34.62 --> 03:39:35.62
Unless you're jacquo.

2922
03:39:35.62 --> 03:39:40.62
You're a, I'm not saying anything over here because of liability.

2923
03:39:40.62 --> 03:39:40.62
Yeah.

2924
03:39:40.62 --> 03:39:41.62
I know.

2925
03:39:41.62 --> 03:39:43.62
I give the worst advice on this kind of stuff.

2926
03:39:43.62 --> 03:39:44.62
Sometimes.

2927
03:39:44.62 --> 03:39:45.62
Yes.

2928
03:39:45.62 --> 03:39:46.62
For sure.

2929
03:39:46.62 --> 03:39:49.62
Also, if you don't have a copy of Musausha.

2930
03:39:49.62 --> 03:39:50.62
Yeah.

2931
03:39:50.62 --> 03:39:53.62
I'm going to list it on the website.

2932
03:39:53.62 --> 03:39:55.62
Go to jacquopodcast.com.

2933
03:39:55.62 --> 03:39:58.62
Go to the books section right there on the top menu.

2934
03:39:58.62 --> 03:39:59.62
Boom click on there.

2935
03:39:59.62 --> 03:40:01.62
It'll be actually it's been on there.

2936
03:40:01.62 --> 03:40:03.62
It's been on there since you mentioned it.

2937
03:40:03.62 --> 03:40:04.62
It's been on there for a year.

2938
03:40:04.62 --> 03:40:05.62
Yeah.

2939
03:40:05.62 --> 03:40:07.62
We saw she's got a bit of a run.

2940
03:40:07.62 --> 03:40:08.62
I'll put it right at the top.

2941
03:40:08.62 --> 03:40:10.62
Don't even have to scroll down.

2942
03:40:10.62 --> 03:40:11.62
Boom click on it.

2943
03:40:11.62 --> 03:40:12.62
Great.

2944
03:40:12.62 --> 03:40:13.62
It's good.

2945
03:40:13.62 --> 03:40:14.62
I had another book to the.

2946
03:40:14.62 --> 03:40:15.62
Right.

2947
03:40:15.62 --> 03:40:16.62
You can book it.

2948
03:40:16.62 --> 03:40:17.62
Yeah.

2949
03:40:17.62 --> 03:40:19.62
That's a lot of percent.

2950
03:40:19.62 --> 03:40:21.62
I'm on it.

2951
03:40:21.62 --> 03:40:29.62
So I have a brand of book that is out which jacquo is part of.

2952
03:40:29.62 --> 03:40:33.62
As a continuation of our our lifelong partnership.

2953
03:40:33.62 --> 03:40:41.62
Jacquo has a reappearance in tribe of mentors, which is I think the easiest to read book that I have yet put together.

2954
03:40:41.62 --> 03:40:46.62
It is brand spanking new has 130 people all asked the same 11 questions.

2955
03:40:46.62 --> 03:40:49.62
That were most burning for me.

2956
03:40:49.62 --> 03:40:52.62
And is that a thousand page book?

2957
03:40:52.62 --> 03:40:53.62
Because it's this.

2958
03:40:53.62 --> 03:40:54.62
It's thick.

2959
03:40:54.62 --> 03:40:56.62
It's shorter than mousashi, which isn't saying much.

2960
03:40:56.62 --> 03:40:59.62
It is about 650 pages.

2961
03:40:59.62 --> 03:41:05.62
Each profile is ranges between two in ten pages.

2962
03:41:05.62 --> 03:41:15.62
And a number of the people who came up in our conversation like Dan Gable, who want a gold medal in the Olympics for wrestling without having a single point.

2963
03:41:15.62 --> 03:41:19.62
It's like winning when bolted and having a point scored up.

2964
03:41:19.62 --> 03:41:20.62
Yeah.

2965
03:41:20.62 --> 03:41:22.62
It doesn't happen people.

2966
03:41:22.62 --> 03:41:24.62
And many, many, many others.

2967
03:41:24.62 --> 03:41:31.62
So covers every possible facet of human performance, whether it's physical training.

2968
03:41:31.62 --> 03:41:38.62
Expert meditators, world class investors, the founders of Facebook, Twitter, sales force, linked in.

2969
03:41:38.62 --> 03:41:39.62
You name it.

2970
03:41:39.62 --> 03:41:44.62
If you want super, super tactical nuggets of advice, including some from our good friend, Jacquo.

2971
03:41:44.62 --> 03:41:48.62
That charba mentors is easy to digest.

2972
03:41:48.62 --> 03:41:50.62
Choose your own adventure.

2973
03:41:50.62 --> 03:41:55.62
Booker that would be a nice nonfiction compliment to our friend, Mousashi.

2974
03:41:55.62 --> 03:41:56.62
Yeah.

2975
03:41:56.62 --> 03:41:57.62
I'm putting it up there.

2976
03:41:57.62 --> 03:41:58.62
Right next to it.

2977
03:41:58.62 --> 03:41:59.62
Boom.

2978
03:41:59.62 --> 03:42:02.62
And so what that does is you click on it, takes you to Amazon.

2979
03:42:02.62 --> 03:42:02.62
Boom.

2980
03:42:02.62 --> 03:42:05.62
And what was the website again for your book page?

2981
03:42:05.62 --> 03:42:07.62
Jacquopodcast.com.

2982
03:42:07.62 --> 03:42:09.62
I think it might be slash books, maybe.

2983
03:42:09.62 --> 03:42:10.62
But easy.

2984
03:42:10.62 --> 03:42:11.62
So you know the top menu.

2985
03:42:11.62 --> 03:42:15.62
The website, but it just looks from the, from episodes, whatever.

2986
03:42:15.62 --> 03:42:16.62
Yeah.

2987
03:42:16.62 --> 03:42:17.62
Click on there.

2988
03:42:17.62 --> 03:42:18.62
Boom.

2989
03:42:18.62 --> 03:42:19.62
Click through there.

2990
03:42:19.62 --> 03:42:21.62
And if you're doing any other Amazon shopping, you know.

2991
03:42:21.62 --> 03:42:22.62
Hey, carry on.

2992
03:42:22.62 --> 03:42:24.62
I'm just going to stop you there.

2993
03:42:24.62 --> 03:42:26.62
Also, subscribe to the podcast.

2994
03:42:26.62 --> 03:42:32.62
I was just going to say they may have already removed this little glitch in the system.

2995
03:42:32.62 --> 03:42:38.62
But I used to be able to buy trap bars and so on on Amazon prime with no shipping.

2996
03:42:38.62 --> 03:42:42.62
Trap bars.

2997
03:42:42.62 --> 03:42:46.62
It's like a 60 pounds to 100 pounds of metal.

2998
03:42:46.62 --> 03:42:51.62
So while you're picking up your brain food, you can pick up your body tools.

2999
03:42:51.62 --> 03:42:52.62
Boom.

3000
03:42:52.62 --> 03:42:53.62
Yeah.

3001
03:42:53.62 --> 03:42:54.62
Dig it.

3002
03:42:54.62 --> 03:42:56.62
You can get your shipping Amazon.

3003
03:42:56.62 --> 03:42:57.62
Yeah.

3004
03:42:57.62 --> 03:42:59.62
I'm so pretty good with their shipping situation.

3005
03:42:59.62 --> 03:43:00.62
I'm going to tell you.

3006
03:43:00.62 --> 03:43:03.62
Like, even if you want it like whatever the next day, you know.

3007
03:43:03.62 --> 03:43:04.62
They're like, pay additional shipping.

3008
03:43:04.62 --> 03:43:06.62
It's like four bucks or something.

3009
03:43:06.62 --> 03:43:07.62
Oh, it's amazing.

3010
03:43:07.62 --> 03:43:08.62
Yeah.

3011
03:43:08.62 --> 03:43:09.62
They got something right on there.

3012
03:43:09.62 --> 03:43:10.62
On there.

3013
03:43:10.62 --> 03:43:13.62
You know, I also subscribed to the podcast if you haven't already.

3014
03:43:13.62 --> 03:43:18.62
On iTunes and Stitcher and Google Play and Spotify, I think.

3015
03:43:18.62 --> 03:43:20.62
I think real confident.

3016
03:43:20.62 --> 03:43:21.62
Yeah.

3017
03:43:21.62 --> 03:43:24.62
You know, whatever you're listening to the podcast on, boom, subscribe.

3018
03:43:24.62 --> 03:43:27.62
Also on YouTube, if you haven't already.

3019
03:43:27.62 --> 03:43:30.62
There's more than just the podcast on YouTube.

3020
03:43:30.62 --> 03:43:32.62
It's excerpts on YouTube.

3021
03:43:32.62 --> 03:43:34.62
Well, are you going to put some.

3022
03:43:34.62 --> 03:43:38.62
Takeaways or what do they call out takes from this one because there are some pretty fine

3023
03:43:38.62 --> 03:43:39.62
ones in the getting there.

3024
03:43:39.62 --> 03:43:40.62
Yeah.

3025
03:43:40.62 --> 03:43:41.62
Yeah.

3026
03:43:41.62 --> 03:43:43.62
I don't forget if you get that they worry, but we were all laughing.

3027
03:43:43.62 --> 03:43:44.62
Yeah.

3028
03:43:44.62 --> 03:43:44.62
Yeah.

3029
03:43:44.62 --> 03:43:45.62
I think so.

3030
03:43:45.62 --> 03:43:47.62
In fact, yes, that's exactly what I'm going to do.

3031
03:43:47.62 --> 03:43:50.62
Which is one of the many reasons to subscribe to the YouTube channel.

3032
03:43:50.62 --> 03:43:53.62
In my opinion, what is the YouTube channel?

3033
03:43:53.62 --> 03:43:55.62
Jockel podcast.

3034
03:43:55.62 --> 03:43:56.62

3035
03:43:56.62 --> 03:43:57.62

This is great.

03:43:58.62 --> 03:43:59.62
Pro.

3038
03:43:59.62 --> 03:44:00.62
Yeah.

3039
03:44:00.62 --> 03:44:01.62
I'm so bad at this.

3040
03:44:01.62 --> 03:44:03.62
I'm just the hand waving.

3041
03:44:03.62 --> 03:44:04.62
The D-barter guy.

3042
03:44:04.62 --> 03:44:08.62
Yeah, I guess technically were when we say subscribe to the podcast.

3043
03:44:08.62 --> 03:44:11.62
Technically we are asking them to go on YouTube.

3044
03:44:11.62 --> 03:44:12.62
Search for Jockel podcast.

3045
03:44:12.62 --> 03:44:13.62
Make sure it's the correct one.

3046
03:44:13.62 --> 03:44:15.62
You know sometimes they'll be like.

3047
03:44:15.62 --> 03:44:16.62
Jockel question.

3048
03:44:16.62 --> 03:44:17.62
That's a joke.

3049
03:44:17.62 --> 03:44:18.62
Or something.

3050
03:44:18.62 --> 03:44:21.62
See Tim adding tons of value.

3051
03:44:21.62 --> 03:44:23.62
Yeah, you could just get.

3052
03:44:23.62 --> 03:44:27.62
You could get and since this will not be published for probably a few hours at least.

3053
03:44:27.62 --> 03:44:31.62
You guys could get a URL like jocco subscribed.com

3054
03:44:31.62 --> 03:44:34.02
and then have it point to a page on your website

3055
03:44:34.02 --> 03:44:36.66
where you have all of the links where people can click

3056
03:44:36.66 --> 03:44:38.10
for different services to subscribe.

3057
03:44:38.10 --> 03:44:40.34
Man, I wish I had somebody that worked with me,

3058
03:44:40.34 --> 03:44:44.58
that like did computer type stuff and stuff like that.

3059
03:44:44.58 --> 03:44:46.10
Cause maybe they would have done that.

3060
03:44:46.10 --> 03:44:47.22
I would have done that.

3061
03:44:47.22 --> 03:44:49.22
At the beginning when we first started this stuff,

3062
03:44:49.22 --> 03:44:51.70
like I'll think it of all of these things.

3063
03:44:51.70 --> 03:44:52.74
This is what I'm gonna buy.

3064
03:44:52.74 --> 03:44:55.38
Jockel podcast this and all this and we can have them all in

3065
03:44:55.38 --> 03:44:58.42
while do this stuff and then like your whole attitude,

3066
03:44:58.42 --> 03:44:59.62
you didn't tell me not to do it.

3067
03:44:59.62 --> 03:45:02.34
I'm not blaming the sign you, I'm just saying

3068
03:45:02.34 --> 03:45:04.66
that that's what I was real fired up to do.

3069
03:45:04.66 --> 03:45:07.62
But he's like, no man, that's a jockel store.

3070
03:45:07.62 --> 03:45:08.26
That's it.

3071
03:45:08.26 --> 03:45:09.22
You know like super simple.

3072
03:45:09.22 --> 03:45:11.46
So I'm like, oh yeah, that's cool right there.

3073
03:45:11.46 --> 03:45:13.30
So like all the cool little things.

3074
03:45:13.30 --> 03:45:15.06
I will, I will, I will,

3075
03:45:15.06 --> 03:45:16.34
and Jockel's defense.

3076
03:45:17.46 --> 03:45:18.26
I'm so sorry.

3077
03:45:18.26 --> 03:45:19.14
No, say it.

3078
03:45:19.14 --> 03:45:20.50
I'm just sure, but there's a there.

3079
03:45:20.50 --> 03:45:21.86
You're a there's a there's a I see tears

3080
03:45:21.86 --> 03:45:22.66
welling up in the eyes.

3081
03:45:23.70 --> 03:45:26.66
In Jockel's defense, I will say that a lot of people

3082
03:45:26.66 --> 03:45:35.06
who try to start podcasts or do X get caught with the obsession

3083
03:45:35.06 --> 03:45:37.94
on new tactics.

3084
03:45:39.38 --> 03:45:41.22
And then above tactics, you would have strategy and then

3085
03:45:41.22 --> 03:45:42.90
above strategy, you would have principles.

3086
03:45:42.90 --> 03:45:46.82
And so if if you're constantly focused on optimizing for an

3087
03:45:46.82 --> 03:45:49.78
additional 1% with these tools, you get nowhere.

3088
03:45:50.98 --> 03:45:54.02
On the other hand, if I would say like you guys have done

3089
03:45:54.02 --> 03:45:59.86
with this podcast to focus on exceptionally high quality,

3090
03:45:59.86 --> 03:46:01.86
that fixes a lot of problems.

3091
03:46:01.86 --> 03:46:05.70
And then other people use tactics on your behalf.

3092
03:46:05.70 --> 03:46:09.14
And you don't have to be as concerned with the

3093
03:46:09.14 --> 03:46:12.58
Edden flow and expiration dates of said tools.

3094
03:46:12.58 --> 03:46:16.02
So there's always a good time always a lot of

3095
03:46:16.02 --> 03:46:16.42
you.

3096
03:46:16.42 --> 03:46:20.58
Right, all that's the only uncrowded market is great.

3097
03:46:20.58 --> 03:46:22.26
That's the only uncrowded market.

3098
03:46:22.26 --> 03:46:24.26
Mm, thanks.

3099
03:46:24.26 --> 03:46:28.02
And just to be clear, when you were like that,

3100
03:46:28.02 --> 03:46:31.22
it wasn't that you were like influencing me not to do it.

3101
03:46:31.22 --> 03:46:33.54
You just like the way you were, was cool to me.

3102
03:46:33.54 --> 03:46:34.74
I was like, dang that's cool.

3103
03:46:34.74 --> 03:46:37.14
So I'm gonna just keep it super simple too.

3104
03:46:37.14 --> 03:46:39.46
And you know, those me just trying to be like you.

3105
03:46:39.46 --> 03:46:40.98
But yeah, I thought of that same thing.

3106
03:46:40.98 --> 03:46:43.06
I'm gonna have the thing and it'll have all the links.

3107
03:46:43.06 --> 03:46:44.34
Oh man, it'll be great.

3108
03:46:44.34 --> 03:46:45.30
That's in minors.

3109
03:46:45.30 --> 03:46:46.42
Like let's record the podcast.

3110
03:46:46.42 --> 03:46:47.94
Okay, let's do that, you know.

3111
03:46:47.94 --> 03:46:48.90
And look at that.

3112
03:46:48.90 --> 03:46:51.22
So we let that other stuff go.

3113
03:46:51.22 --> 03:46:54.90
Anyway, YouTube, back to YouTube.

3114
03:46:54.90 --> 03:46:55.90
Jocopodcast.

3115
03:46:55.90 --> 03:46:59.46
The regular logo black white letters.

3116
03:46:59.46 --> 03:47:00.46
Boom, that's it.

3117
03:47:00.46 --> 03:47:03.42
That's the one that you want to subscribe to.

3118
03:47:03.42 --> 03:47:04.50
Also, Joc was a store.

3119
03:47:04.50 --> 03:47:05.74
It's called Joc was store.

3120
03:47:06.82 --> 03:47:08.90
Now see that, no bells, no whistles.

3121
03:47:08.90 --> 03:47:11.58
Joc will store.com.

3122
03:47:11.58 --> 03:47:14.54
T-shirts, travel mugs, bumper stickers, all that stuff.

3123
03:47:14.54 --> 03:47:17.58
So mash guards, new rash guards.

3124
03:47:17.58 --> 03:47:21.30
Who these pickerhoodies?

3125
03:47:21.30 --> 03:47:23.70
I got people who are more picturesque than thermometers.

3126
03:47:23.70 --> 03:47:24.70
And the brass.

3127
03:47:24.70 --> 03:47:25.70
Say worse, man.

3128
03:47:25.70 --> 03:47:27.70
Yeah, I do that.

3129
03:47:27.70 --> 03:47:30.42
Yeah, actually, yeah, someone did that to me too.

3130
03:47:30.42 --> 03:47:33.62
What about your crop tops with the display equals love?

3131
03:47:33.62 --> 03:47:36.82
And then there's out of stock stuff.

3132
03:47:36.82 --> 03:47:38.62
Those are out of stock, bro.

3133
03:47:38.62 --> 03:47:39.62
I don't know.

3134
03:47:39.62 --> 03:47:46.50
Actually, but the women stuff is back in stock as well.

3135
03:47:46.50 --> 03:47:47.50
That was out for a while.

3136
03:47:47.50 --> 03:47:50.50
Blue girls, you know, for the girls, for the ladies.

3137
03:47:50.50 --> 03:47:53.54
Boom, back in the game, big time.

3138
03:47:53.54 --> 03:47:54.86
Some patches in there.

3139
03:47:54.86 --> 03:47:58.26
And again, the rash guards, where you're kid.

3140
03:47:58.26 --> 03:48:00.42
I think that's the one.

3141
03:48:00.42 --> 03:48:01.42
Yeah.

3142
03:48:01.42 --> 03:48:02.42
Actually, this is another one.

3143
03:48:02.42 --> 03:48:03.42
There I used to.

3144
03:48:03.42 --> 03:48:05.42
Or Pete got them running.

3145
03:48:05.42 --> 03:48:07.46
Question about rash guards.

3146
03:48:07.46 --> 03:48:12.62
I always assumed, because I'd never seen rash guards until a few years into the Joc

3147
03:48:12.62 --> 03:48:18.22
YouTube game, I guess, or observing that I assumed that rash guards became part of

3148
03:48:18.22 --> 03:48:24.38
Jocitsu because Brazilians also surf a lot and would then just use them in the gym.

3149
03:48:24.38 --> 03:48:26.70
What is the function of the rash guard?

3150
03:48:26.70 --> 03:48:28.30
I've never quite understood that.

3151
03:48:28.30 --> 03:48:33.90
I know that because let's say versus wearing a tight fitting, like sweat-wicking shirt.

3152
03:48:33.90 --> 03:48:34.90
Yeah.

3153
03:48:34.90 --> 03:48:37.26
Well, I mean, it's not going to be as tight fitting as a rash guard as right?

3154
03:48:37.26 --> 03:48:42.02
A rash guard is as tight fitting as a piece of garment can be.

3155
03:48:42.02 --> 03:48:43.90
And therefore, your fingers won't get caught in it.

3156
03:48:43.90 --> 03:48:45.30
Your toes won't get caught in it.

3157
03:48:45.30 --> 03:48:46.30
It won't get in the way.

3158
03:48:46.30 --> 03:48:49.74
And that's why you can also just go shirtless.

3159
03:48:49.74 --> 03:48:56.02
But when you go shirtless, now you've got ringworm and all whatever other heinous forms of

3160
03:48:56.02 --> 03:48:57.78
diseases that live on the mat.

3161
03:48:57.78 --> 03:49:03.78
And so that's, and it just takes it one separation away from pure nastiness when you're

3162
03:49:03.78 --> 03:49:04.78
wrong with everyone.

3163
03:49:04.78 --> 03:49:08.86
Well, you guys should make maybe of the only one with this issue, but I always find

3164
03:49:08.86 --> 03:49:14.10
I feel constricted at the neck and hot in certain rash guards, not all rash guards.

3165
03:49:14.10 --> 03:49:18.26
But if there were one that gave some space to the neck, that would be.

3166
03:49:18.26 --> 03:49:19.26
Yeah.

3167
03:49:19.26 --> 03:49:23.10
I think some brands will have a wider neck.

3168
03:49:23.10 --> 03:49:24.10
wider neck.

3169
03:49:24.10 --> 03:49:26.98
Some brands will actually, on purpose, have like a higher neck.

3170
03:49:26.98 --> 03:49:27.98
Right.

3171
03:49:27.98 --> 03:49:30.74
Some people want full coverage in the gym.

3172
03:49:30.74 --> 03:49:33.18
They want, they don't want to make human contact with anyone else.

3173
03:49:33.18 --> 03:49:34.18
Yeah.

3174
03:49:34.18 --> 03:49:35.18
Just the spider men outfit.

3175
03:49:35.18 --> 03:49:36.18
Well, they're trying to throw it.

3176
03:49:36.18 --> 03:49:37.18
Yeah.

3177
03:49:37.18 --> 03:49:38.98
There's people that wear little hoods.

3178
03:49:38.98 --> 03:49:39.98
I'm not kidding.

3179
03:49:39.98 --> 03:49:40.98
Yeah.

3180
03:49:40.98 --> 03:49:42.78
So yeah, it's getting crazy.

3181
03:49:42.78 --> 03:49:44.82
There's people with like hair or something like that.

3182
03:49:44.82 --> 03:49:45.82
Like long hair.

3183
03:49:45.82 --> 03:49:46.82
Long hair.

3184
03:49:46.82 --> 03:49:47.82
Yeah.

3185
03:49:47.82 --> 03:49:48.82
Long hair.

3186
03:49:48.82 --> 03:49:49.82
Yeah.

3187
03:49:49.82 --> 03:49:50.82
Long hair.

3188
03:49:50.82 --> 03:49:51.82
Yeah.

3189
03:49:51.82 --> 03:49:52.82
Yeah.

3190
03:49:52.82 --> 03:49:53.82
Long hair.

3191
03:49:53.82 --> 03:49:54.82
Yeah.

3192
03:49:54.82 --> 03:49:55.82
Yeah.

3193
03:49:55.82 --> 03:49:56.82
Yeah.

3194
03:49:56.82 --> 03:49:57.82
Yeah.

3195
03:49:57.82 --> 03:49:58.82
Long hair.

3196
03:49:58.82 --> 03:49:59.82
Yeah.

3197
03:49:59.82 --> 03:50:00.82
Yeah.

3198
03:50:00.82 --> 03:50:01.82
Yeah.

3199
03:50:01.82 --> 03:50:02.82
Long hair.

3200
03:50:02.82 --> 03:50:03.82
Yeah.

3201
03:50:03.82 --> 03:50:03.82
Yeah.

3202
03:50:03.82 --> 03:50:04.82
Yeah.

3203
03:50:04.82 --> 03:50:05.82
Yeah.

3204
03:50:05.82 --> 03:50:06.82
Yeah.

3205
03:50:06.82 --> 03:50:07.82
Yeah.

3206
03:50:07.82 --> 03:50:08.82
There is out.

3207
03:50:08.82 --> 03:50:09.82
Malma.

3208
03:50:09.82 --> 03:50:12.22
I commented on his garment.

3209
03:50:12.22 --> 03:50:13.22
Yeah.

3210
03:50:13.22 --> 03:50:14.22
But yeah.

3211
03:50:14.22 --> 03:50:15.22
Hey, jockels.com.

3212
03:50:15.22 --> 03:50:16.22
That's where you get them.

3213
03:50:16.22 --> 03:50:17.22
They're cool.

3214
03:50:17.22 --> 03:50:19.30
Also, psychological warfare.

3215
03:50:19.30 --> 03:50:22.14
If you didn't know what that is, it's an album with tracks.

3216
03:50:22.14 --> 03:50:23.66
Tim Peres.

3217
03:50:23.66 --> 03:50:25.66
That if you're on the path.

3218
03:50:25.66 --> 03:50:26.66
Yeah.

3219
03:50:26.66 --> 03:50:27.66
Hopefully.

3220
03:50:27.66 --> 03:50:33.54
But you find those days or those moments, whatever that maybe you might want to get

3221
03:50:33.54 --> 03:50:34.54
this door.

3222
03:50:34.54 --> 03:50:37.22
You like you're going to choose to step off the path.

3223
03:50:37.22 --> 03:50:38.70
That's what it's for, really.

3224
03:50:38.70 --> 03:50:40.78
It's not like when you suddenly get distracted.

3225
03:50:40.78 --> 03:50:43.98
It's like, I'm going to wake up at what five.

3226
03:50:43.98 --> 03:50:45.70
And I'm just too tired.

3227
03:50:45.70 --> 03:50:47.38
I'm not going to wake up at five.

3228
03:50:47.38 --> 03:50:48.50
I'm going to sleep in.

3229
03:50:48.50 --> 03:50:49.74
You listen to one of these tracks.

3230
03:50:49.74 --> 03:50:51.30
The specified track though.

3231
03:50:51.30 --> 03:50:53.50
Wake up and get a, what's it called?

3232
03:50:53.50 --> 03:50:54.78
Wake up and get after it.

3233
03:50:54.78 --> 03:50:56.06
Wake up and get after it.

3234
03:50:56.06 --> 03:51:00.82
What it is is you play it and it's jockel telling you why you should wake up and get

3235
03:51:00.82 --> 03:51:01.82
after it.

3236
03:51:01.82 --> 03:51:03.30
Pragmaticly.

3237
03:51:03.30 --> 03:51:04.30
In his own jockel.

3238
03:51:04.30 --> 03:51:07.26
But there's, there's tracks for everything though.

3239
03:51:07.26 --> 03:51:09.58
Waking up, sleeping on the diet, skipping the workout.

3240
03:51:09.58 --> 03:51:10.78
I'll probably ball that stuff.

3241
03:51:10.78 --> 03:51:14.74
Now let me interject to you or actually take over if you don't mind.

3242
03:51:14.74 --> 03:51:15.74
Please.

3243
03:51:15.74 --> 03:51:21.90
Because the psychological warfare trial album on iTunes was the number one spoken word album

3244
03:51:21.90 --> 03:51:24.74
for about, I think, nine months straight.

3245
03:51:24.74 --> 03:51:27.14
And unfortunately, good news and bad news.

3246
03:51:27.14 --> 03:51:28.50
It was just taken down for it.

3247
03:51:28.50 --> 03:51:31.38
We just got beat out as the number one album.

3248
03:51:31.38 --> 03:51:33.06
There's now a new number one album.

3249
03:51:33.06 --> 03:51:34.06
Yeah.

3250
03:51:34.06 --> 03:51:35.06
It's not drafts.

3251
03:51:35.06 --> 03:51:40.98
The new number one album on iTunes spoken word is Discipline equals freedom.

3252
03:51:40.98 --> 03:51:41.98
Field manual.

3253
03:51:41.98 --> 03:51:42.98
Now it is number one.

3254
03:51:42.98 --> 03:51:43.98
Did you see that?

3255
03:51:43.98 --> 03:51:44.98
Yeah.

3256
03:51:44.98 --> 03:51:46.38
I did the report every day.

3257
03:51:46.38 --> 03:51:50.90
So if you've been looking for Discipline equals freedom, field manual in audio format,

3258
03:51:50.90 --> 03:51:54.42
formula, it's not unautable because then you couldn't put it in your alarm.

3259
03:51:54.42 --> 03:51:56.50
You couldn't listen to tracks whenever you wanted to.

3260
03:51:56.50 --> 03:51:58.30
That's why we didn't do it that way.

3261
03:51:58.30 --> 03:52:05.62
We put it as an album with tracks on Amazon, music, Google Play, Spotify, Spotify, everywhere.

3262
03:52:05.62 --> 03:52:09.06
I think you can access Alexa, she'll deliver it.

3263
03:52:09.06 --> 03:52:10.06
Yeah.

3264
03:52:10.06 --> 03:52:12.34
Alexa, like boom, you're there.

3265
03:52:12.34 --> 03:52:13.34
So that's out.

3266
03:52:13.34 --> 03:52:16.94
Also, when Amazon jok-a-white tea, most people think it's the best tea that they've

3267
03:52:16.94 --> 03:52:17.94
ever had.

3268
03:52:17.94 --> 03:52:23.70
And it's guaranteed and scientifically proven to increase your debt lift to a minimum of

3269
03:52:23.70 --> 03:52:25.02
8,000 pounds.

3270
03:52:25.02 --> 03:52:27.70
We have all backed up data on that.

3271
03:52:27.70 --> 03:52:32.10
Double blind, double blind, quick, quadruple blind.

3272
03:52:32.10 --> 03:52:37.38
Other books to get on Amazon and we Muslims put all these books on our website.

3273
03:52:37.38 --> 03:52:46.06
So first, Tim, Tim, obviously, for our work week, for our chef, for our body, tools of

3274
03:52:46.06 --> 03:52:47.42
Titans.

3275
03:52:47.42 --> 03:52:50.34
Those are all books, awesome books.

3276
03:52:50.34 --> 03:52:53.10
And I was thinking about four hour work week.

3277
03:52:53.10 --> 03:52:56.74
And what I was thinking about four hour work week, that I think when I read it for the first

3278
03:52:56.74 --> 03:53:02.82
time, which was before I knew you, what it did, I didn't follow anything in your book for

3279
03:53:02.82 --> 03:53:03.82
our work week.

3280
03:53:03.82 --> 03:53:05.34
I didn't follow one thing.

3281
03:53:05.34 --> 03:53:06.34
Maybe I don't know.

3282
03:53:06.34 --> 03:53:07.54
Maybe there's two or three things in there.

3283
03:53:07.54 --> 03:53:12.66
What it did though is it made me look at things in a different way.

3284
03:53:12.66 --> 03:53:15.06
Because you were saying, look, here's this.

3285
03:53:15.06 --> 03:53:16.58
And you looked at it from over here.

3286
03:53:16.58 --> 03:53:19.86
And what it showed me was, I can look at things differently.

3287
03:53:19.86 --> 03:53:23.02
And you know, like I said, I probably grabbed a couple of things from there.

3288
03:53:23.02 --> 03:53:26.70
But the most important thing that it gave me was, like, okay, you don't have to look

3289
03:53:26.70 --> 03:53:28.90
at this, the way everyone else is looking at it.

3290
03:53:28.90 --> 03:53:35.22
And that's the best damn drill you can get from somebody or the best advice you can get

3291
03:53:35.22 --> 03:53:38.18
somebody who's like, don't look at things the same way everyone else is.

3292
03:53:38.18 --> 03:53:39.74
There's a whole other angle.

3293
03:53:39.74 --> 03:53:43.70
And once I saw what angle you were looking at it from, I started saying, well, let's

3294
03:53:43.70 --> 03:53:44.70
look at it from my angle.

3295
03:53:44.70 --> 03:53:46.30
What is this going to look like from over here?

3296
03:53:46.30 --> 03:53:48.90
So that's a great book.

3297
03:53:48.90 --> 03:53:53.50
And again, the four hour chef, which is, it's about cooking, but it's really about learning.

3298
03:53:53.50 --> 03:54:00.78
For our body, all kinds of good experiments that you did on yourself, you're similar

3299
03:54:00.78 --> 03:54:01.78
to me.

3300
03:54:01.78 --> 03:54:03.38
And the fact that I'm always chasing some different goal.

3301
03:54:03.38 --> 03:54:04.78
I'm either trying to do max pull-ups.

3302
03:54:04.78 --> 03:54:06.22
I'm trying to do a max deadlift.

3303
03:54:06.22 --> 03:54:07.94
I'm trying to cut down my one mile run time.

3304
03:54:07.94 --> 03:54:10.38
I've always got some random thing that I'm trying to do.

3305
03:54:10.38 --> 03:54:15.70
And I explain this, I actually explain it when I was just on your podcast.

3306
03:54:15.70 --> 03:54:20.30
If I'm not going to get to a 600 pound deadlift because my whole life would have to

3307
03:54:20.30 --> 03:54:23.82
be different and I wouldn't be able to do other things that I like to do.

3308
03:54:23.82 --> 03:54:28.86
So I get to an 80% or an 85% of what I'm actually humanly capable of.

3309
03:54:28.86 --> 03:54:32.42
And then I'm looking for that next goal because I'm not going to change my entire life.

3310
03:54:32.42 --> 03:54:36.10
But what the four hour body is good for is you've got a lot of different things that

3311
03:54:36.10 --> 03:54:39.98
you can bounce from thing to thing and they're all going to improve some aspect.

3312
03:54:39.98 --> 03:54:41.26
So I thought that was awesome.

3313
03:54:41.26 --> 03:54:48.50
Tools of Titans obviously, tons of good information from a lot of different people.

3314
03:54:48.50 --> 03:54:55.14
And now you've got tribe of mentors and it's interesting because when we talk about for

3315
03:54:55.14 --> 03:54:59.38
20 minutes or however long we were talking about the path for people out there that are

3316
03:54:59.38 --> 03:55:01.90
saying, well, what path?

3317
03:55:01.90 --> 03:55:03.74
And I'm sitting here trying to explain it's hard.

3318
03:55:03.74 --> 03:55:04.90
I don't think I did a good job.

3319
03:55:04.90 --> 03:55:06.38
I took a swing at it.

3320
03:55:06.38 --> 03:55:09.70
But what's cool is you get a book like tribe of mentors and you can kind of get a feel

3321
03:55:09.70 --> 03:55:14.34
for what other people's paths are and how they stay on them and way they live their lives.

3322
03:55:14.34 --> 03:55:19.30
And then you can at least at a minimum get a different perspective from different people,

3323
03:55:19.30 --> 03:55:25.22
which just like for our work week for me is very important to see different people's angles

3324
03:55:25.22 --> 03:55:28.58
on the way they look at things.

3325
03:55:28.58 --> 03:55:31.74
It's like it's an eye opener at a minimum.

3326
03:55:31.74 --> 03:55:32.74
Yeah, the lens.

3327
03:55:32.74 --> 03:55:38.42
I mean, if you have a set of different lenses that you can look through to evaluate the

3328
03:55:38.42 --> 03:55:44.26
world and make decisions, evaluate yourself and make different decisions, it can really

3329
03:55:44.26 --> 03:55:49.02
change your life in the lives of those around you very, very quickly.

3330
03:55:49.02 --> 03:55:54.06
What's been fun about putting together in this case tribe of mentors is that I'm asking

3331
03:55:54.06 --> 03:55:55.62
people the same 11 questions.

3332
03:55:55.62 --> 03:56:01.50
So for instance, I might ask, what do you do or what do you tell yourself when you feel

3333
03:56:01.50 --> 03:56:03.50
overwhelmed or get distracted?

3334
03:56:03.50 --> 03:56:06.30
So we're talking about staying on the path.

3335
03:56:06.30 --> 03:56:10.14
And I asked, I, that was one of the questions that I sent to everyone and people were able

3336
03:56:10.14 --> 03:56:11.34
to pick and choose their questions.

3337
03:56:11.34 --> 03:56:20.34
But when you see that across disciplines and so you have everyone from, say, David Lynch

3338
03:56:20.34 --> 03:56:28.62
were Darren Aronowski were incredible directors to the Dan Gables, the Kelly Slators,

3339
03:56:28.62 --> 03:56:36.94
most decorated surfer of all time, to artists and investors and so on.

3340
03:56:36.94 --> 03:56:40.70
There are commonalities so you can spot patterns.

3341
03:56:40.70 --> 03:56:44.58
And then assemble your own toolkit of these first principles we've been talking about.

3342
03:56:44.58 --> 03:56:49.22
So for instance, one that I've been applying, there are many that I've been applying myself

3343
03:56:49.22 --> 03:56:53.46
from the book, you may have met Kyle Manard before.

3344
03:56:53.46 --> 03:56:54.46
I know he is.

3345
03:56:54.46 --> 03:56:55.46
I have better.

3346
03:56:55.46 --> 03:57:00.66
So Kyle, incredible guy, a congenital quad amputee that means he was born without arms

3347
03:57:00.66 --> 03:57:02.94
or legs, became a wrestler.

3348
03:57:02.94 --> 03:57:04.18
I mean among many other things.

3349
03:57:04.18 --> 03:57:10.66
I mean, became a wrestler lost every match his first season and his dad supported him.

3350
03:57:10.66 --> 03:57:13.62
Throughout it all, they were accused of child abuse.

3351
03:57:13.62 --> 03:57:16.22
He kept competing and then he started winning.

3352
03:57:16.22 --> 03:57:19.22
And the same people who said it was child abuse were like, oh he isn't now he is an unfair

3353
03:57:19.22 --> 03:57:20.22
advantage.

3354
03:57:20.22 --> 03:57:22.70
Because people can grab his arms and legs.

3355
03:57:22.70 --> 03:57:23.70
I was like, really?

3356
03:57:23.70 --> 03:57:24.70
Wow.

3357
03:57:24.70 --> 03:57:26.22
What a world.

3358
03:57:26.22 --> 03:57:31.34
And just a fascinating guy who has done a lot climbed to Kilimanjaro.

3359
03:57:31.34 --> 03:57:36.34
I think he was the first person ever to do so quad amputee without prosthetics.

3360
03:57:36.34 --> 03:57:43.54
I heard the ashes of a fallen member of our military to the top, which was one of their

3361
03:57:43.54 --> 03:57:44.78
dying wishes.

3362
03:57:44.78 --> 03:57:52.18
And he gave a piece of advice that he learned from a business icon, which was you can't

3363
03:57:52.18 --> 03:57:53.70
answer seven.

3364
03:57:53.70 --> 03:58:00.94
And what that refers to is any time you are rating for yourself, say how important something

3365
03:58:00.94 --> 03:58:05.78
is or how much you want to do something on a scale of 0 to 10, you can't use seven.

3366
03:58:05.78 --> 03:58:08.66
You're asking someone for feedback, they can't use seven.

3367
03:58:08.66 --> 03:58:09.66
Why?

3368
03:58:09.66 --> 03:58:17.34
Because all of a sudden they can't choose what I realized after reading it is a safe, comfortable,

3369
03:58:17.34 --> 03:58:18.34
nebulous number.

3370
03:58:18.34 --> 03:58:20.66
And that's always seven.

3371
03:58:20.66 --> 03:58:26.38
Now you have to choose a six, which is barely better than 50 percent, or an eight.

3372
03:58:26.38 --> 03:58:34.34
And you get to accelerate your path to better decisions almost immediately, just by adopting

3373
03:58:34.34 --> 03:58:35.34
that.

3374
03:58:35.34 --> 03:58:41.74
Or the way that say Daniel Negrano, Fator Holzyser, two of the biggest winning poker players

3375
03:58:41.74 --> 03:58:47.70
of all time, one in live in person tournaments, the other online, and to look at their

3376
03:58:47.70 --> 03:58:53.34
decision frameworks, how they decide how much to bet, how they stake other people.

3377
03:58:53.34 --> 03:58:56.54
These are all tools that you can apply everywhere.

3378
03:58:56.54 --> 03:58:58.70
It's really cool stuff.

3379
03:58:58.70 --> 03:59:01.98
So yeah, Triva Mentors have been a very, very fun book to put together.

3380
03:59:01.98 --> 03:59:06.30
It's, I've been on the road, but one of your people sent it to me.

3381
03:59:06.30 --> 03:59:08.30
So I think it's a waiting for me at my house when I get back.

3382
03:59:08.30 --> 03:59:11.34
So I'm stoked on that one.

3383
03:59:11.34 --> 03:59:16.14
And what you show me that flip through, that's kind of why I know it's going to be cool

3384
03:59:16.14 --> 03:59:23.42
for people to get, again, find the path, find various paths and help them guide them towards

3385
03:59:23.42 --> 03:59:25.42
theirs.

3386
03:59:25.42 --> 03:59:27.42
I also wrote a couple other books.

3387
03:59:27.42 --> 03:59:30.34
One of them is called Way of the Warrior Kid.

3388
03:59:30.34 --> 03:59:34.78
That's about a kid who turns into a warrior kid.

3389
03:59:34.78 --> 03:59:36.78
Best book ever.

3390
03:59:36.78 --> 03:59:39.54
Extreme ownership, book about leadership.

3391
03:59:39.54 --> 03:59:46.18
It's combat leadership principles from war and how to apply them in your business and

3392
03:59:46.18 --> 03:59:47.78
life.

3393
03:59:47.78 --> 03:59:51.46
The discipline equals freedom, field manual.

3394
03:59:51.46 --> 03:59:54.66
Once again to everyone that got this book, including Tim.

3395
03:59:54.66 --> 03:59:56.78
Yes, thank you for supporting it.

3396
03:59:56.78 --> 04:00:02.06
Also, the book because of your support, it made the New York Times bestseller list, which

3397
04:00:02.06 --> 04:00:03.06
is pretty awesome.

3398
04:00:03.06 --> 04:00:04.58
Thank you, everyone.

3399
04:00:04.58 --> 04:00:05.58
Thank you, Tim.

3400
04:00:05.58 --> 04:00:06.58
Of course.

3401
04:00:06.58 --> 04:00:07.58
That's awesome.

3402
04:00:07.58 --> 04:00:12.30
And you know, the book, it doesn't follow any formula, really.

3403
04:00:12.30 --> 04:00:15.02
It's not normal.

3404
04:00:15.02 --> 04:00:16.02
It's kind of like this podcast.

3405
04:00:16.02 --> 04:00:17.02
It's not normal.

3406
04:00:17.02 --> 04:00:18.74
It's not, you know, not everyone's going to get it.

3407
04:00:18.74 --> 04:00:23.86
Some people are going to turn on this podcast and go, I don't think I can listen to that.

3408
04:00:23.86 --> 04:00:24.86
That's okay.

3409
04:00:24.86 --> 04:00:26.58
Same thing with the book.

3410
04:00:26.58 --> 04:00:27.58
That's okay, too.

3411
04:00:27.58 --> 04:00:30.14
I'm not here to write things that everyone likes.

3412
04:00:30.14 --> 04:00:31.62
I'm not here to record a podcast.

3413
04:00:31.62 --> 04:00:33.14
Everyone wants to listen to.

3414
04:00:33.14 --> 04:00:36.14
I'm okay with that.

3415
04:00:36.14 --> 04:00:37.94
The other those of you that do get it.

3416
04:00:37.94 --> 04:00:41.86
Thank you for forgetting it.

3417
04:00:41.86 --> 04:00:43.14
For those of you don't get it.

3418
04:00:43.14 --> 04:00:44.14
Why are you still listening?

3419
04:00:44.14 --> 04:00:46.90
It's three and a half hours later.

3420
04:00:46.90 --> 04:00:49.46
Stop punishing yourself.

3421
04:00:49.46 --> 04:00:51.14
They're imposing discipline on themselves.

3422
04:00:51.14 --> 04:00:56.34
I can make it for you guys annoying voice for another 20 minutes.

3423
04:00:56.34 --> 04:00:59.62
I guess the audio version is on MP3 platforms.

3424
04:00:59.62 --> 04:01:02.46
I've been asked that 5,000 times on social media.

3425
04:01:02.46 --> 04:01:04.26
It's everywhere by the way.

3426
04:01:04.26 --> 04:01:05.26
Everywhere.

3427
04:01:05.26 --> 04:01:06.70
So that's good.

3428
04:01:06.70 --> 04:01:11.14
If you need some leadership support for your team or for your business, Ashlan Front,

3429
04:01:11.14 --> 04:01:13.10
that's on leadership consulting company.

3430
04:01:13.10 --> 04:01:19.86
It's me, Lave Babin, JP D'Nel, Dave Burke, info at echelonfront.com.

3431
04:01:19.86 --> 04:01:21.26
If you want to get it.

3432
04:01:21.26 --> 04:01:23.34
Echo, you got to clothing songs.

3433
04:01:23.34 --> 04:01:24.34
That's it.

3434
04:01:24.34 --> 04:01:25.34
Thanks Tim.

3435
04:01:25.34 --> 04:01:27.02
Yeah, thank you, gentlemen.

3436
04:01:27.02 --> 04:01:29.66
Then I use the word gentlemen loosely.

3437
04:01:29.66 --> 04:01:32.22
If you want to keep this conversation going,

3438
04:01:32.22 --> 04:01:35.42
we are actually on the interwebs.

3439
04:01:35.42 --> 04:01:41.42
Fairly heavily on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.

3440
04:01:41.42 --> 04:01:43.34
Echo is at echelonfront.

3441
04:01:43.34 --> 04:01:44.54
I am at Jocca-Willink.

3442
04:01:44.54 --> 04:01:49.90
And Tim is at T-Farris 2R's 2S's on Twitter,

3443
04:01:49.90 --> 04:01:51.62
on Instagram at Tim.

3444
04:01:51.62 --> 04:01:55.74
And Ferris 2R's 2S's on Facebook, Tim Ferris.

3445
04:01:55.74 --> 04:01:56.74
You got it.

3446
04:01:56.74 --> 04:01:58.06
Did I miss anything else?

3447
04:01:58.06 --> 04:02:00.66
Alright, Tim, any clothing thoughts from you, sir?

3448
04:02:00.66 --> 04:02:04.34
Any clothing thoughts?

3449
04:02:04.34 --> 04:02:11.18
I'll share one quote if people like quotes that I think relates well to a lot of what

3450
04:02:11.18 --> 04:02:13.94
we talked about and certainly Musashi.

3451
04:02:13.94 --> 04:02:16.34
And this is a quote from Arke Locus.

3452
04:02:16.34 --> 04:02:21.54
So by the sound of the name, you might guess it's very, very old.

3453
04:02:21.54 --> 04:02:25.18
It is we do not rise to the level of our expectations.

3454
04:02:25.18 --> 04:02:28.86
We fall to the level of our training.

3455
04:02:28.86 --> 04:02:34.94
Hope is not a strategy as James Cameron would say.

3456
04:02:34.94 --> 04:02:35.70
Train hard.

3457
04:02:35.70 --> 04:02:38.98
Train hard.

3458
04:02:38.98 --> 04:02:40.78
Tim, as always, thanks for everything.

3459
04:02:40.78 --> 04:02:47.06
I literally would not be sitting here right now if it wasn't for you.

3460
04:02:47.06 --> 04:02:50.42
And what's cool is you've helped me out a lot, but more importantly,

3461
04:02:50.42 --> 04:02:53.46
you've helped out all kinds of people all over the world.

3462
04:02:53.46 --> 04:02:54.46
I think that's awesome.

3463
04:02:54.46 --> 04:02:57.94
The content that you put out, the advice that you give to people.

3464
04:02:57.94 --> 04:03:03.98
And so thank you for what you've done for me and thanks for what you do for all kinds

3465
04:03:03.98 --> 04:03:04.98
of people everywhere.

3466
04:03:04.98 --> 04:03:05.98
Thank you, Jim.

3467
04:03:05.98 --> 04:03:08.54
I'm much appreciated.

3468
04:03:08.54 --> 04:03:14.58
And while I'm thanking people to close this out, I'm going to thank the real warriors

3469
04:03:14.58 --> 04:03:20.38
out there that are in uniform on the front holding the line against evil.

3470
04:03:20.38 --> 04:03:21.70
Thank you for what you do.

3471
04:03:21.70 --> 04:03:26.86
And those of you that are back here in uniform at home, police, law enforcement,

3472
04:03:26.86 --> 04:03:32.74
firefighters, paramedics, all the other first responders, thank you all for keeping our

3473
04:03:32.74 --> 04:03:34.94
homeland safe.

3474
04:03:34.94 --> 04:03:40.30
And to everyone else that's listening.

3475
04:03:40.30 --> 04:03:45.02
Just remember that the world is filled with the sound, the waves and the waves are filled

3476
04:03:45.02 --> 04:03:49.82
with little fishes.

3477
04:03:49.82 --> 04:03:53.66
But them play.

3478
04:03:53.66 --> 04:03:57.26
Let them dance, let them sing.

3479
04:03:57.26 --> 04:04:08.50
You, you get on the path and stay on the path and keep getting after it.

3480
04:04:08.50 --> 04:04:16.38
Until next time, this is Tim Ferriss and Echo and Jocco.

3481
04:04:16.38 --> 04:04:43.46
1st!
