But with it felt like, and feels like with people like my soldiers, you know, there is a lot of room for like, because men, these are my brothers, you know, my guys, but let's say they're talking about like something else like a big one. You tell me, I personally think, let's say I've been giving some slack and people been showing up a little bit late, showing up a little bit late, and I'm kind of like, hey, man, you know, we need to be a little more in time and then finally on a Thursday, guys shows up late for the meeting, and I say, hey, you're suspended, you're grounded, you're, you know, you're going to work this weekend. Because you know if you're like naturally gifted or whatever at something you're in a way not like, like, I don't know what that's like. Like the bartenders that you so work with everyone's in a while, you'd have one and say well, I got this and you know, my bar and when they talk to the customers, you know, they're like hey, what kind of, I don't know, vodka do you have. or you just see the result in one way or Like these good like fighters or you know I don't know author like anyone doing absolutely so it's like, you know, like, let's say you open a Getsagee gym, and then, you know, you're teaching people, and then you're like, okay, You know you can't say like um hey I'm going to go see this concert and then afterwards I'm going to pick up guitar and play you know the solos with you know you're clapped in. It's kind of like when I was talking today about like, Hey, if you're a vet, you can't look at everyone like, Hey, this person's just, I had to be, I had to be like, okay, echo's not a bad person. Maybe like, oh, I've been letting people slack, so I got to make an example out of somebody to kind of re-establish the discipline kind of thing, or maybe, you know, as a boss or whatever, you really don't like this specific violation. Or if you have like with this procrastination situation, oh man, that's the main one that, you know, like, how you're always like, hey, I need to do this. So you know what it is like you know what that means you know. Like, you know, you know that they were like, okay, does vitamin C help? Well, you know, like when you brew tea, it's like, I don't know. So even if you like in your situation, if you're like, you know, someone's like, hey, Doc, where do you train? You know, where it's like, oh, yeah, you could be just a member, but at least you're part of that community, you know, kind of thing. That's why you're, you know, that's why party your morality is like, you know, fairness doing the right thing, all this discipline, stuff. You know, like even like slow and brushed in my teeth, like I do every week or whatever. Yeah, that's kind of like when I look at my old videos, you know, at the time, like, And then they tell my best vodka is, you know, this and that, then they'd say my, you know, kind of like I'm the master of this whole domain here, everything here is mine, and that I can bestow upon you kind of feeling. You know how like you get creative guys, but they don't have discipline or you get super disciplined guys, but they don't have creativity or you know. If you're down for it, sometimes people, you know, you put it on your T, let's say in your grud, you know, you're working out, where you're, you know, it's on the TV. But this guy who's a Master Chief when I met him, and he was telling me that when he, you know, at the seal team, you know, you PT in the morning, just like a sports team, you get to work and you work out. This is, when I'm thinking about it, this is just an amateur, you know, I was probably 22 years old, maybe 23 years old, but you know, young and immature and not getting the best guidance, not understanding things, not understanding that I wasn't helping build a cohesive unit, not understanding that this guy's probably thinking, oh, I don't want to help him. Hey, do you think that, you know, when people say, I'm going to make an example out of somebody, you know, for, sometimes it's for different reasons. It's obvious, you know, they call that the curse a knowledge, you know, home when you're, you're like so advanced in this one thing that you forget how it is to not be advanced. But yeah, like if you recommend a movie or something like that, and then mean while looking at the reviews, the reviews are like super good. I guess this is like a technology is kind of been around, but I didn't know because I had that plastic cup, you know, whatever. You know, the kind of like you put it in, but it was like kind of stuck. but I feel like it's, I mean, it's easy for you, you know, to be like, Yeah, it's you. And something happened, and we gave like a, like, a, like, hey guys, don't, don't ever make the putoon look bad. So you know how, you know, at home, you know, you have your cup. What I'm saying, you know how you say it, like you probably don't know about that because you don't have the curse of knowledge in regards to physical activity working out. And people that say that physical strength aren't good, he says, you know, I forget the exact quote, but he's basically saying, I, I know physical strength is good. Yeah and this is like like actually choking up the person you know Yeah, I always felt that a better way instead of saying my, one of the few things as far as feelings go because I, I, I, I experienced that a lot when people be like my, this and that, you know, and I see what you're doing. You know, but you're like, you just know better ways now. So, you know, like a football game or a movie or something that you're not doing to put you, you know, more forward on your path or whatever. You know, but at the same time, you, you, when I look back on it, I know I was not a good leader, right? You know, it's like, it's just this great event, you know. You know, you know that feeling where it's like dang. It's not like it's not like, hey, you're going to learn some stuff, but it's not going to be really applicable. It's like you're just the boss and the owner of all this kind of thing, you know, kind of thing. I don't want, you know, if if something was going to give you a bad reputation, like what we just talked about, if you fall out of a patrol as a leader or as anyone. Most times like if you go to like a you know And now I'm going to set the bar so high that I've lose track of the, lose vision of the fact that like, hey, the guy that I'm trying to convince right now is a 23 year old thing and the most important thing in his world is this is 20. It's like that thing that starting strength, coach, Rippato says, I, I post, I've never talked about it, but I posted, you know, He's talking about how physical strength is good. You know, like, you really like, I couldn't believe it. You know, and then they'll be like, but I'm glad it was like that. It was like maybe like 24 ounce, like big cup. And of course, there's, you know, there's exceptions here, but generally speaking, and plus you're talking about a little bit more of a broad thing like a leader.
