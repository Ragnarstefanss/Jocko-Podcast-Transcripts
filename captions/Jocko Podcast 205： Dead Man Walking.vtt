00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is Jockel podcast number 205 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And with us once again is a sag warrior, Dick Thompson, and he, we started on podcast 203.

3
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So if you haven't listened to that one yet, go back and listen to 203 and we talked for about three hours.

4
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And now we got to a point where we're going to cover an operation that took place.

5
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And Dick actually gave me a document based on this operation called, called rest and recuperation, R and R.

6
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So Dick, welcome back to the podcast. Thank you. Glad to be here.

7
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And like I said, if you haven't listened to 203 yet, you want to get the background for Dick Thompson,

8
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Sog warrior, and we're going to jump into this mission once again.

9
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The title is document that did gave me his rest and recuperation.

10
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And I'll jump right into it.

11
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
As my eyes opened and I became conscious of the world around me, I could hear the buzzing of a large fly.

12
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Some muffled Vietnamese voices outside of my hooch and a radio playing by me a ticket on an airplane.

13
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000
This song quickly generated memories of my best friend Bob, who had been killed on a mission a few weeks earlier.

14
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:52.000
He and I had done everything together, basic training, officer candidate school, airborne, ranger, special forces, and volunteered for Sog.

15
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We've been together for over two years.

16
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This song would forever bring back strong memories of the good times we had together.

17
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We'd often discussed the low probability of either of us returning to the world.

18
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Bob's death had been a significant emotional event in my life and one thing I was still trying to deal with.

19
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So here you are.

20
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
How long you've been in Vietnam for at this point?

21
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
You and Bob got to Vietnam together.

22
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
How long you've been there for?

23
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Six months or so.

24
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So you've been there for six months after everything that you've been through with Bob.

25
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And and Bob gets, how did you find out who told you?

26
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Actually, I got a letter from a girl that my had been dating and Bob was dating her best friend.

27
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So we were double dating a lot.

28
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And she found out from Bob's friend who found out from Bob's parents.

29
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And then she wrote me. So I opened his letter up and you know, there it was.

30
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And you know, she said, I'm sure you've heard by now.

31
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And you know, I hadn't.

32
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
But so this is nail mail. This is, this is, yeah.

33
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So the family had been notified, then the girlfriend had been notified.

34
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And then the girlfriend writes you, we're talking, you didn't find out for a month.

35
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Yeah.

36
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
At least.

37
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
That's kind of crazy.

38
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I mean, that's crazy.

39
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Yeah, thanks for slow back.

40
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Well, no, you're that. And this is something that Tillton I talked about was,

41
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
you guys didn't always get the best turnover of information because everything was so secret.

42
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So this is an example of everything so secret that your best friend gets killed.

43
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And you don't even find out about it.

44
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
You find out about it from your, your girlfriend's friend, which is his girlfriend.

45
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Yeah.

46
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So I mean, he was a, he was down at CC, see.

47
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So I mean, we didn't really know what their missions were or what they were doing.

48
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So being on a team, I didn't know what they were doing down there.

49
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And, you know, we didn't have, you know, communication back and forth.

50
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So I didn't know what he was doing.

51
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So it was tough.

52
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Plus, mail that you got didn't go directly to you.

53
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
All mail, if you were sending me up, like my mother sent me a letter,

54
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000
it didn't go to me. It went to me through another mail center and be a nom.

55
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:42.000
That then sent the mail to CCN because it had to be screened because they didn't want anything

56
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
about classified operations.

57
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Mail going out had to be screened.

58
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So any letter I sent would, you know, start at CCN.

59
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
It would go down to the sideguide.

60
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
It would be screened.

61
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And then eventually, you know, it would be mail to her.

62
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So now, is this just confirming, like, you know, we talked about on the last podcast that you're thinking you're knocking up.

63
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
You're 22 now.

64
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
You didn't think you were going to make it to 22.

65
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Is this got to be confirming that you're not going to see 23?

66
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Yeah, kind of got my attention.

67
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So, and the other thing is there's no, I mean, you, there's no ceremony.

68
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
There's no, well, not, there wasn't where we were.

69
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Okay. I mean, we had ceremonies on a regular basis at CCN for the guys there who would be in kill.

70
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
I mean, however, I mean, people were being killed almost every week,

71
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
but, you know, in every two or three weeks, we'd have, you know, like a memorial service.

72
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So, all right. So back to this story.

73
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
As I looked up, I could see my car 15 hanging just above my head.

74
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I had on my normal sleeping attire, shirt, fatigue, pants, and jungle boots.

75
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Our compound was hit with rockets, mortars, and ground attacks on a regular enough basis that you had to be prepared to react quickly.

76
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Although it was only a little after nine o'clock in the morning,

77
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
the temperature inside my room was already in the 90s, and I was soaked with sweat.

78
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000
But my mind began to travel back through the past two weeks and recall how my team had barely escaped the NVA during the last mission.

79
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
We had made it back to our compound in Denang and spent the last two days undergoing a very intense debriefing session,

80
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
conducted by our intelligence team at an effort to collect all the information they could about our mission.

81
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
The next two days were mine for R&R, REST and Recruperation, before we began preparing for another mission.

82
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000
My plan was to sleep late each morning, eat real food, take several showers, and rest.

83
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:49.000
We had to say that Denang is all right, and it had a lot of meaning right now, of course everything is relative.

84
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So there you go. You've finally got a couple days down time.

85
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
You're going to eat some steak and enjoy yourself.

86
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
This was Sunday morning in the mess hall, served as served breakfast until lunch.

87
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Soon I was eating and looking forward to the evening meal.

88
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Our mess sergeant always managed to have plenty of tea bone steaks every Sunday evening.

89
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
No one asked where he got them because it was certainly not standard rations for a combat unit.

90
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Everyone would agree with his steak to his own perfection.

91
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
This was something we all looked forward to.

92
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
When you've been on mission for several days or weeks, eating one meal a day, usually rice and fish heads.

93
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
This was a feast.

94
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So you're living large.

95
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Oh yeah. That's a great.

96
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
After I finished breakfast, experience told me that I better go make myself invisible until it was time to go back to work.

97
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
If you could be seen, you could be given work to do while you are on R&R.

98
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
I decided to go off-limit to an off-limit section of the Nang where we had a safe house.

99
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
The safe house was a secret location, CCN, R unit, owned, and protected.

100
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
It was heavily guarded by mercenaries and only accessible to buy our people.

101
00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000
My get out of jail free card, which was a special card that authorized us to travel in civilian clothes,

102
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
carry conceal weapons, enter classified and restricted areas, etc.

103
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Would allow me to travel into this area of the Nang even during curfew.

104
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
This would be my best chance of enjoying the next two days.

105
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Everything was looking good and I was beginning to relax.

106
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So you get the little get out of jail free card, huh?

107
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Yeah.

108
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I'm not sure everyone had them, but I know some of us live.

109
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And it basically said, don't mess over this guy.

110
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I mean, you couldn't just walk around through the cities and, you know, particularly after curfews and things like that.

111
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Or you would get picked up.

112
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
You'd be in trouble, but with that card when I flashed that,

113
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000
they either let me go or they would call the phone number on there and be told, letting go.

114
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And don't ask him what he's doing, just leaving him on.

115
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
It's legit continuing on.

116
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
The sky had become overcast and it looked like it would probably rain by afternoon.

117
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
The temperature was steadily climbing and the humidity was outproaching 100%.

118
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
This type of heat and humidity had a debilitating effect on everyone.

119
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
As I was walking toward the compounds gate, I heard the familiar,

120
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
w-w-w-w-w-w-l-sound of a helicopter.

121
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I could see that it was approaching our helicopter. There was- there seemed to be a flurry of activity in that area.

122
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
I was only about 100 meters from it as the chopper landed.

123
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
The strong smell of JP4 was mixed with a wind and sand that hit my face.

124
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000
The men running around had placed some bags in the cargo compartment of the chopper and we're now talking to the crew chief.

125
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
One of them spotted me and began yelling something at me.

126
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
The sound of the helicopter prevented me from understanding what he was saying.

127
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
It was obvious that he was very excited about something. He began to run toward me still shouting.

128
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
As he got close, I heard him yell, LT,

129
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Do you know how to hook up a McGuire rig?

130
00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.000
A McGuire rig is 120 to 150 foot nylon rope with a large loop made out of heavy padded strap attached to the end of it.

131
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
A bag of sand is tied to the loop to give it the momentum to penetrate the jungle canopy.

132
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
The other end of the rope is attached to the floor of the helicopter.

133
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
The rope is stowed inside a sandbag and a manner that allows it to feed without tangling.

134
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
It is used when team members have to be extracted from the jungle where the helicopter cannot land.

135
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
The team members sits inside the strap and fastens his left wrist to the strap through small loop.

136
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.000
This prevents him from falling completely out of the rig if he is shot or when he is drugged through treetops during extraction.

137
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000
It would be very uncomfortable and painful to hang by one arm, but at least you would get out.

138
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
As we ran to the helicopter, he told me that we had a team in trouble with casualties.

139
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
One of our CH34 helicopters had gone into the area to attempt an extraction.

140
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
During the attempt, it had been shot down and apparently exploded and burned on impact.

141
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
There appeared to be two or three survivors.

142
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Another helicopter left a few minutes ago to try and help.

143
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
There were no LZs in the area, just a very high and thick jungle canopy.

144
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
The McGuire rigs would be needed for extraction.

145
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
This is all spinning up and you are hearing about what is happening.

146
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
You are 10 minutes from walking out the gate and being on our fur a couple days.

147
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Our last.

148
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
I know how to do this. I do it all the time.

149
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
I am usually on the other end of that rope.

150
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
When you walked over the river, you think you are just going to rig it?

151
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
That is why you were asked.

152
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
You know how to put them in there.

153
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
He is saying, hey, we got to get them a Gwire rig rigged.

154
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Do you know how to do it? Yes, you know how to do it.

155
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Cool. Come on over to the helicopter and you are thinking, I will help you guys rig.

156
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
There is troops on the ground and contact. They need help.

157
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Okay, got it.

158
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Here we go.

159
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I took one look at the gate.

160
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
About 150 meters away as we continue to run.

161
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
The plans I had for my day were quickly being put on hold as my adrenaline level climbed.

162
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
In my mind, I could see the smoldering remains of a burned helicopter dead and wounded crew members

163
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and the bad guys moving in for the final kill.

164
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Time was of the essence. I had to quickly rig the helicopter so they could go to the area and get the survivors out.

165
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
As I approached the helicopter, I leaned my car 15 and ammunition band allure against the connex container.

166
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
I climbed into the cargo compartment of the helicopter and began working feverously to attach them a Gwire rigs.

167
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
After a few minutes, the crew chief leaned over to me and said, the team isn't heavy contact.

168
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
We have to go.

169
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
At that point, I realized I had been concentrating so much on what I was doing.

170
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
I had not noticed the pilot had turned up the engine RPMs and the aircraft was beginning to vibrate.

171
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
In fact, we were lifting off the ground.

172
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
I pulled the crew chief over to me and said, I'm not supposed to be on here.

173
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
He looked back at me and shrugged his shoulders as if to say, sorry about that.

174
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
That was one of those common sayings in Vietnam.

175
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Sorry about that.

176
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I mean, you saw it all over the place.

177
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
You heard people saying that.

178
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Anytime something was happening, like that, it was sorry about that.

179
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Yeah.

180
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Anytime something was happening, like you're getting, you don't have your weapon.

181
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
So that's a key point.

182
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
You would set down, you're going to rig this thing and for anyone that doesn't know you're on your knees,

183
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
when you're rigging something like that, you're on your knees,

184
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and you're, you know, got to use both your hands.

185
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So you just thought, you yourself, oh, cool.

186
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Well, I said, my, my mission right now is just to rig this thing.

187
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
What's going to expediate that the most is, or expedite that the most is for me just to put my weapon down over here.

188
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
I'll get on there.

189
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I'll get it rigged and then I'll get out.

190
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
That's the fastest way for me to get this done.

191
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
All right.

192
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Next thing you know, the helicopter's taken off.

193
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Yeah.

194
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Sorry about that.

195
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Yeah.

196
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
As I looked down and saw the compounds gate.

197
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
As I looked down, I saw the compounds gate passed under me.

198
00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:00.000
I sat back against the fire wall, fastened to seat belt around my waist and resigned myself to the fact that my R&R would be delayed a couple of hours.

199
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
As we flew and I began to realize that it had not known where I was going.

200
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
What I, what I was going to do and was naked.

201
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
I'd left my weapon and ammunition leaning against the connox.

202
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
I was flying into combat without a weapon.

203
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
The only thing I had was my fatigue and boots and a pounding heart.

204
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
What a Sunday afternoon of R&R.

205
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
This was turning into.

206
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
About 15 minutes into the flight.

207
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
My mind began to play out different scenarios of what might happen when we arrived on the battle site.

208
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
One began to stick in my mind.

209
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
What if the aircraft ahead of us is shot down?

210
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
What if the only way to save them is for someone to go down there using them a Guyer rig?

211
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
What if I have to climb down one of the ropes?

212
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
I don't even have a weapon.

213
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
About this time the crew chief pulled me toward him and said,

214
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
the aircraft in front of us has been shot down.

215
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
The team is still in heavy contact and cannot go to the crash site.

216
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
We'll be there in about 10 minutes.

217
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
The Pucker Factor just increased significantly.

218
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
My premonition was becoming a reality.

219
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
As I was thinking, I saw this play out.

220
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
It was like watching a video.

221
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
I mean, I could see the whole thing just taking place.

222
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
That's the premonition.

223
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
This is what's going to happen.

224
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
When he told me that aircraft is down, I told him.

225
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
It goes ahead and said something.

226
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
He said it's happening.

227
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
It's starting now.

228
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
This is a crazy thought that you say to yourself,

229
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
what if the aircraft ahead of us get shot down?

230
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Seconds later, he looks at you and says the aircraft in front of us is shot down.

231
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
That's a nightmare.

232
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Going on, the crew chief and the other door gunner test fired their machine guns to make sure they were working properly.

233
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
This brought about a sudden increase in my excitement level.

234
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Test fired the door guns always seemed to insert a sense of morality,

235
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
mortality into what I was about to do.

236
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
In a few minutes, the crew chief pulled me over again and said,

237
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
it's just over this ridge line.

238
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
I unfasten my seat belt and crawled over to the edge of the cargo compartment,

239
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
so I could see better.

240
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
As we came over the ridge line, we were welcomed by bad guys.

241
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
A stream of automatic weapons fire with some green treasures mixed in past by.

242
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
The loud crack of each bullet could easily be heard over the noise of the helicopter.

243
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Both door gunners opened up and began sending a hail of bullets through the jungle canopy.

244
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
The most fearful part of combat for me had always been getting shot at while in a helicopter.

245
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
There is no protection. The floor and the sides of a helicopter just don't stop bullets.

246
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
My arousal level was continuing to climb.

247
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
The pilot made a quick turn and bank the helicopter on its side.

248
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
I was looking straight down at the jungle canopy and hanging on for my life.

249
00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Smoke was coming up through a hole in the canopy where the first helicopter had gone down and burned.

250
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
As we circled around the steep side of the mountain,

251
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
we saw another hole in the canopy about 200 meters from the first.

252
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
When we approached this hole and slowed down the ground fire, coming up at us increased.

253
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Shell casings from the door guns were piling up on the floor.

254
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Some were falling out.

255
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
As we passed directly over the hole, I could see the second helicopter lying on its side in the steep ravine.

256
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000
The tail section was broken off and I thought I saw a crew member still in the aircraft.

257
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
We circled around and came in for a closer look.

258
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000
This time I could see the aircraft was trapped inside the aircraft and fuel was spilling out on them.

259
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Any spark from inside the craft or a trace around would ignite the fuel and burn them alive.

260
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
The door gunners were continuing to place your press and fire in the position shooting at us.

261
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
It wasn't really having much effect on them.

262
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
But let's we're coming up at us from all directions.

263
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000
We also detected some movement that indicated the bad guys were working their way up the mountain to the crash site.

264
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Something had to be done and fast.

265
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000
I'm trying to think of myself if anything could be worse right now.

266
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
But I actually can't think of anything worse through this right now.

267
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Well, I knew what was coming.

268
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
So I mean, I had already seen it play out.

269
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
I mean, at this point is only one thing you can do.

270
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
You got to go down there.

271
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
And these helicopter pilots, these guys are bad ass.

272
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.000
I mean, these guys for just to be thinking with all this enemy fire coming, they're not going anywhere.

273
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
They're going to get this done.

274
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Yeah, because they've got that's their friends.

275
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Yeah, friends are down there now.

276
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Back to the book here.

277
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
I told the crew chief to tell the pilot to go back to the crash site and I would drop him a

278
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:56.000
goire rig down into the canopy, climb down to it, then climb down a tree to the ground.

279
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
So I'm going to say that one more time.

280
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Your plan was to throw this rope out of the aircraft, climb down into the canopy somewhere

281
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
once you were getting in the trees, then you would just climb down the trees until you got to the ground.

282
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
That was your plan.

283
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
My stress level was a little high.

284
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
So I probably wasn't making the best plans that I could.

285
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
But at the time that was the only way I could see to get down to him.

286
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
When he told him, this is the crew chief talking to the pilot.

287
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
When the crew chief told the pilot, both the pilot and the co-pilot looked around over their shoulders

288
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
as if to say to me, are you crazy?

289
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
The crew chief leaned over and said, the pilot says you're crazy.

290
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I told him to tell the pilot that I might be crazy, but his buddies were going to die if I a horrible

291
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
death in a few minutes if we didn't do something.

292
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
He quickly turned the aircraft around and flew back to the crash site.

293
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000
I pushed out one of the McGuire rigs and the bag of sand quickly took it into the canopy.

294
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
We were still receiving heavy ground fire.

295
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
At this point we were approximately 50 feet above the canopy.

296
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
I happened to see that the crew chief had an M16 strapped the wall behind him.

297
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
I told him to give it to me.

298
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
He was a little hesitant at first, probably because he thought he would never see

299
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
it again.

300
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
He handed it to me along with a bandelier of four magazines.

301
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
I chambered around and checked the safety and fought great.

302
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:29.000
I'm going into the middle of the battle myself by myself with a hundred rounds of ammunition.

303
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Yeah.

304
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
And it gets worse.

305
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.000
I mean, this is not a good scenario for in terms of survivability at all.

306
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:41.000
At all.

307
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Are you thinking about that or are you just trying to think of what you're just doing

308
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
the best you can?

309
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Doing what I got to work with.

310
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
We got to get those guys out.

311
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
I stepped out onto the skater the helicopter confident that I had a workable plan.

312
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
As I grabbed the rope with my bare hands, I realized it was brand new white nylon rope.

313
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
New nylon ropes are very slick.

314
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
I knew I was going to be tough to hold on, but I figured I could wrap my feet around

315
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
it and make it work.

316
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
The crew chief leaned over and said the pilot says we're receiving too much ground fire.

317
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
We're going to have to leave.

318
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
I knew it was now or never.

319
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
I stepped off the skid and quickly began to discover some flaws in my plan.

320
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
That's an interesting decision point right there.

321
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Because you got it out.

322
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
You've got it out right there of, hey, it's too much ground fire.

323
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Sorry, I couldn't get down there.

324
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
And instead of you saying, hey, sorry, we had to leave.

325
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
And I'm sorry, I couldn't go.

326
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
You said it's now or never.

327
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
You stepped off the skid and descended into hell.

328
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
I could not hold the slick rope tight enough.

329
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
It began to slide through my hands at a faster and faster rate after about 30 feet.

330
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
The white rope began to turn red.

331
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
It had burned the skin off the inside of my hands.

332
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And I was bleeding badly and could not slow down to make matters worth.

333
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
The rope no longer reached the canopy.

334
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
The aircraft was beginning to move because of the ground fire and it lifted the end of the rope

335
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
about 10 to 15 feet above the tree tops.

336
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000
My rate of descent was increasing rapidly and the only thing I could, that could prevent my death

337
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
was to be able to hold onto the maguire rig at the end of the rope.

338
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
So now the end of the rope is 15 feet above the canopy.

339
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Which means if you fall off of it, you're going to go 10 to 15 feet of airborne.

340
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
And then you're going to hit the trees.

341
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Unknown to me at this time our tactical operation center in the compound was monitoring the helicopter's radio frequency.

342
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
I found out later that about this time a fourth aircraft had arrived in the area and was observing my descent.

343
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
He radioed my aircraft and asked who the hell is that.

344
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
The reply was, some crazy special forces guy.

345
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
At the time that probably would have been my reply too.

346
00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000
When I hit the maguire rig I closed down with every ounce of strength I had left and I stopped.

347
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
The pain in my hands was unreal blood was running down my arms.

348
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
It seemed as if the bad guys had stopped shooting at the helicopter and were shooting at me.

349
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000
As I looked up I could see the red streams of tracers coming down from the door gunners and the green tracers going up.

350
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:23.000
The loud cracking sounds of bullets were all around me. I was now also now swinging on the end of a large pendulum about 10 feet above the canopy.

351
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
I knew the canopy was about 150 feet above the jungle floor.

352
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
My strength was gone. It was decision time.

353
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:42.000
I decided that as I swung over the center of the next tree top I would let go and try to grab hold of something as I crashed through the canopy.

354
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Once again this is ridiculous.

355
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:57.000
This is when I watch a stupid action movie and they show some guy jumping out of a hell of a helicopter or jumping off of a cliff and landing in the trees.

356
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
And I was like, that's that's BS. That would never work.

357
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Apparently I need to spend more time hanging out with you to figure out what's going to work and what's not.

358
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:16.000
So that's your plan. Your plan is that you're 10 feet above the 150 foot tall jungle canopy when you see a good target to jump into you're going to go.

359
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Back to this book. I looked down and as I centered the tree top I let go.

360
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:29.000
The fall brought my stomach up in my throat. The sensation was quickly overcome by the impact with the jungle canopy.

361
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:39.000
I grabbed wildly as I crashed through the limbs but just couldn't seem to hold on to anything. I was moving too fast and was just bouncing off limbs leaving blood and skin on each one.

362
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Finally I hit a limb with my stomach and wrapped around it and knocked the breath out of me but I had stopped falling.

363
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:56.000
After a few minutes I was able to begin my descent. There was only about 50 feet to go which means you had thumpled through a hundred feet of jungle canopy.

364
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:06.000
This is again you might have been thinking the same thing that I thought I can pull this off until your father that thing you go. I was this isn't working the way I thought it was going to work.

365
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:14.000
I didn't have much I felt I didn't have much choice. I knew I couldn't hold on to the McGuire rig and you were used to fix and fly away.

366
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:27.000
I was going to be much higher and when I fell off that would be it. At least now I was 10 feet of both something and I might have a chance if I let go and dropped into it.

367
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Trying to hold on to that thing. I wouldn't have lasted a couple more minutes and then that would have been it.

368
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:48.000
I was not going to do anything. I was going to do something. I'm giving you about max hero credit on each and every decision that's being made whether it was falling.

369
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
When you said hey I'm going that's all I need to hear.

370
00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:00.000
When I finally reached the ground I had to lie behind the tree for a few minutes to rest. At this point I had very little skin on the palms. My hands are inside my fingers.

371
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
My fingers dirt and tree bark were all in my hands. There were numerous other cuts and bruises caused by the fall.

372
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Through the tree fortunately I still had my I still had the M16 and band allure but I had lost the magazine that was in the rifle during the fall.

373
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
I was now down to 81 rounds. There was one in the chamber.

374
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
I could hear the fire flight the team was involved in about 2 to 300 meters from me.

375
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:35.000
More guy, bad guys were probably moving around the jungle. A feeling of loneliness crept over me as I realized that not only would the bad guys be shooting at me but so would the team because they probably did not know I was on the ground.

376
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:43.000
I moved out rapidly in the direction of the crash site that was no time to waste. I'd only moved about 50 meters when I heard a twig break to my left.

377
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:53.000
As I looked in that direction I saw 2 soldiers with AK 47's about 30 meters away moving parallel to me. Just as I turned my weapon toward them they both saw me and began to turn their weapons toward me.

378
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000
In the next fraction of a second I had to decide if they were really bad guys or two of the team members dressed like bad guys.

379
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:08.000
I had practiced an immediate action drill for just such an occasion hundreds of times on our firing range and used it in previous encounters.

380
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000
I was in a position to take them out as I dove for the ground I emptied a 20 round magazine on them.

381
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:24.000
It was a tight shot group and I saw both of them get hit several times as I quickly changed magazines. I watched and listened for any signs of life from their position.

382
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.000
They had gone down in the undergrowth where I could not see them. My attack had been so sudden and violent that they had not been able to return fire.

383
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:44.000
I decided that those two were not going to cause me any more trouble. I called up the hill a ways and then continued to move toward the crash site.

384
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
That's that immediate action drill that you talked about or take the shots as you're going down.

385
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
You chew full auto.

386
00:27:51.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Well, yeah. In that situation you don't fault you shot full auto.

387
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:09.000
If I can spray a relatively tight shot group, I'm going to get them and I know I got hit a more than one second.

388
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
I can't just pop off a couple of rounds because if I shoot it one that gives the other one the chance to shoot at me.

389
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:22.000
So I go for both moments same time. Was the team that you were going to rescue? Was that another?

390
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
It was a team in country thing.

391
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
So you know that they're on the ground out there too.

392
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:35.000
I knew when I saw these two guys were the AK 40-cellens.

393
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.000
I could hear the M16 fire. I knew it was not a team that was carrying AK 40-cellens.

394
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
They said it'd be bad guys.

395
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Yeah, because going into this you had no any if you had spent 10 minutes getting a brief on what was happening.

396
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
You would have found out how big the team was. What kind of weapons they had.

397
00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Just some just some little kind of nice to know information which you had none of your brief was there's good guys down.

398
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Yeah.

399
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
And sorry about that.

400
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Yeah. And sorry.

401
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
After moving about 150 meters a shot was fired at me. I thought it sounded strange as I'd deal for cover.

402
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
It wasn't a rifle. It was a pistol probably a 38 caliber.

403
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
AK 47's made a different and very distinguishable sound. The helicopter crew was shooting at me.

404
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
The pilot managed to crawl out of the wreckage and this is from the down helicopter.

405
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
The pilot managed to crawl out of the wreckage, seen my movement and begun firing at me with his 38.

406
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
I yelled at him and told him I was a good guy. He did not believe me and continued to shoot.

407
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:39.000
My experience had been that helicopter pilots were very cool, calm and in control when they were in the air.

408
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:47.000
The jungle was a different matter. He continued to fire me until he had to reload at that point. I rushed him and got the drop on him.

409
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
He was battered, wounded, bloody and exhausted and kept asking me where my other men were.

410
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
He found it hard to believe that I was alone.

411
00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.96
I eventually convinced him that it was just me and that we had to get his men out of the aircraft to quickly spot why moved him to a very dense

412
00:30:01.96 --> 00:30:06.96
location of the jungle a short distance away and continued to go back and retrieve the crew one at a time.

413
00:30:06.96 --> 00:30:11.96
Most of the crew had lost a lot of blood and required immediate first aid. They were all injured as a result of the crash.

414
00:30:11.96 --> 00:30:17.96
The pilot had broken ribs, broken arm, cut some bruises, the copilot had a compound fracture of the femur.

415
00:30:17.96 --> 00:30:19.96
The bone was sticking out of his thigh.

416
00:30:19.96 --> 00:30:26.96
Cut some bruises. The crew chief had been shot in the leg and the door gunner in the arm. All four were soaked in JP4.

417
00:30:26.96 --> 00:30:28.96
A spark would have made torches of them all.

418
00:30:28.96 --> 00:30:37.96
I told the pilot that I was going to get help for him and to keep everyone hidden quiet and not to shoot anyone unless they physically stepped on them.

419
00:30:40.96 --> 00:30:42.96
Yeah.

420
00:30:43.96 --> 00:30:51.96
I began to move out toward the other crash site. By this time that firefight had stopped and I was not sure where the team or the enemy were.

421
00:30:51.96 --> 00:30:58.96
My movement was very cautious because of the team saw my movement they would open fire and they would not miss.

422
00:30:58.96 --> 00:31:04.96
As I near the other crash site, I heard some movement up, up front and some muffled voices.

423
00:31:04.96 --> 00:31:11.96
I moved very slowly and deliberately. I heard an American voice at this point. I could only assume that the enemy had captured one of the survivors from the first crash.

424
00:31:11.96 --> 00:31:17.96
My plan was to move in as closely as possible and look for an opportunity to attack and free the American.

425
00:31:17.96 --> 00:31:23.96
As I crept closer and closer to the group, I eventually got close enough to see an American sergeant that I recognized.

426
00:31:23.96 --> 00:31:26.96
He was the team leader of the team that was on the ground.

427
00:31:26.96 --> 00:31:29.96
We still armed and obviously not a prisoner.

428
00:31:29.96 --> 00:31:32.96
So this is about the first good situation that's unfolded.

429
00:31:32.96 --> 00:31:33.96
Yeah.

430
00:31:33.96 --> 00:31:38.96
You got some brothers now that are going to be able to work with you in some way.

431
00:31:38.96 --> 00:31:45.96
I got down behind a tree and yelled in and I was coming in and for him to have his people hold their fire.

432
00:31:45.96 --> 00:31:50.96
After he told me it was okay, I stood up slowly with my M16 and the air and walked toward the group.

433
00:31:50.96 --> 00:31:59.96
Once inside there perimeter I discovered that the loud American was the loud American voice was that of the American Lieutenant Colonel who had been the pilot of the first aircraft to be shot down.

434
00:31:59.96 --> 00:32:04.96
He was not very happy about what was going on and was giving the sergeant a hard time.

435
00:32:04.96 --> 00:32:09.96
Speaking of stress, right?

436
00:32:09.96 --> 00:32:17.96
You know, you know, anger and not making good decisions and being loud and being confrontational.

437
00:32:17.96 --> 00:32:19.96
So this Lieutenant Colonel is doing all those things.

438
00:32:19.96 --> 00:32:21.96
He's being confrontational with a sergeant.

439
00:32:21.96 --> 00:32:23.96
You don't want to do that.

440
00:32:23.96 --> 00:32:25.96
You did not want to do that.

441
00:32:25.96 --> 00:32:30.96
I informed the Lieutenant Colonel that I was the senior ground commander and was now in charge of the operation.

442
00:32:30.96 --> 00:32:35.96
The fact that a Lieutenant Colonel out ranks the Lieutenant did not matter because he was air force and we were on the ground.

443
00:32:35.96 --> 00:32:40.96
He became very upset and began to threaten me about what was going to happen to me when we got to safety.

444
00:32:40.96 --> 00:32:43.96
About that time the mercenaries on the team had heard enough.

445
00:32:43.96 --> 00:32:49.96
Several of them turned their weapons toward the Lieutenant Colonel and made some very cold and serious remarks.

446
00:32:49.96 --> 00:32:55.96
The interpreter told the Lieutenant Colonel that the Lieutenant wasn't charged and that everyone would do what I said.

447
00:32:55.96 --> 00:33:02.96
The Lieutenant Colonel realized they were ready to kill him if he did not submit that ended the discussion.

448
00:33:02.96 --> 00:33:07.96
So that's what happens when you when you try and get confrontational with the sergeant team on the ground.

449
00:33:07.96 --> 00:33:09.96
Yeah, I mean you don't know.

450
00:33:09.96 --> 00:33:11.96
The serge teams get very closely bonded.

451
00:33:11.96 --> 00:33:16.96
They're very closely bonded to the ones zero one one, you know, to their Americans.

452
00:33:16.96 --> 00:33:18.96
You don't mess with them anywhere.

453
00:33:18.96 --> 00:33:21.96
I mean they will defend that team.

454
00:33:21.96 --> 00:33:23.96
They'll defend those Americans.

455
00:33:23.96 --> 00:33:26.96
I mean even inside the compound you don't want to mess with them.

456
00:33:26.96 --> 00:33:31.96
I mean the compound is kind of like the old West.

457
00:33:31.96 --> 00:33:39.96
Everybody there is carrying a gun and there's locked in loaves not like the regular military units around.

458
00:33:39.96 --> 00:33:44.96
But the can't have a magazine in the gun.

459
00:33:44.96 --> 00:33:47.96
We were locked and loaded all the time.

460
00:33:47.96 --> 00:33:53.96
Yeah, it had frag grenades, you had all that stuff and you got these little pods moving around.

461
00:33:53.96 --> 00:33:55.96
And they're autonomous.

462
00:33:55.96 --> 00:33:57.96
Don't mess with my guy.

463
00:33:57.96 --> 00:34:02.96
Yeah, because they're locking load on you.

464
00:34:02.96 --> 00:34:03.96
And now we're out in the jungle.

465
00:34:03.96 --> 00:34:04.96
Yeah.

466
00:34:04.96 --> 00:34:05.96
And they see this guy as a threat.

467
00:34:05.96 --> 00:34:08.96
Yeah, a threat to their survival too.

468
00:34:08.96 --> 00:34:13.96
You know, a threat to you as the leader threat to their team and a threat to this survival.

469
00:34:13.96 --> 00:34:18.96
Because if this guy is going to start acting like an idiot, this is going to be a real problem.

470
00:34:18.96 --> 00:34:19.96
Yeah.

471
00:34:19.96 --> 00:34:21.96
So they put an end to that.

472
00:34:21.96 --> 00:34:26.96
Our next step was to move back down to the first crash site and recover the bodies.

473
00:34:26.96 --> 00:34:33.96
During this time, I discovered that there had been three survivors of the original crash, the Lieutenant Colonel, which was the pilot of Vietnamese Lieutenant Colonel,

474
00:34:33.96 --> 00:34:35.96
Copilot and an American sergeant.

475
00:34:35.96 --> 00:34:39.96
The Vietnamese and the sergeant had been badly injured and burned in the crash.

476
00:34:39.96 --> 00:34:46.96
The second helicopter to arrive on the site had lowered a jungle penetrator and Lieutenant Colonel had strapped them into it.

477
00:34:46.96 --> 00:34:52.96
Unfortunately, as they were being hoisted up through the jungle canopy, the second helicopter was also shot down.

478
00:34:52.96 --> 00:35:00.96
As it went forward, the jungle penetrator hung up on a large tree and the steel cable broke.

479
00:35:00.96 --> 00:35:09.96
The two men still strapped to the penetrator, fell across me, a hundred feet and landed head first on a large rock killing them instantly.

480
00:35:09.96 --> 00:35:12.96
We found the bodies and unhooked them from the jungle penetrator.

481
00:35:12.96 --> 00:35:18.96
When I got, when I picked up the American and put him over my shoulder, the air rushed out of his lungs.

482
00:35:18.96 --> 00:35:25.96
He was the smell of death as we worked our way back up the hill, it began to rain.

483
00:35:25.96 --> 00:35:30.96
So the second one had actually started to extract the team.

484
00:35:30.96 --> 00:35:33.96
And that's when they got shot down.

485
00:35:33.96 --> 00:35:38.96
They were extracting the wounded from the first aircraft.

486
00:35:38.96 --> 00:35:50.96
And you might want to edit out the smell of the attack, the little statements. Just in case some family members should listen to this.

487
00:35:50.96 --> 00:35:59.96
I think, for as parents are gone now, but he may still have brothers, sisters or somebody.

488
00:35:59.96 --> 00:36:06.96
Just so it doesn't sound so bad.

489
00:36:06.96 --> 00:36:12.96
Once inside the main perimeter, we laid the bodies down alongside each other.

490
00:36:12.96 --> 00:36:19.96
The heads were a bloody mess, and since we did not wear names on our uniforms, I did not know who I had carried up the hill.

491
00:36:19.96 --> 00:36:23.96
At this point, I asked the Lieutenant Colonel who the young sergeant was.

492
00:36:23.96 --> 00:36:29.96
The already-sickening feeling of my stomach increased tremendously when I heard his name.

493
00:36:29.96 --> 00:36:32.96
He was a friend of mine who I had joked with days before.

494
00:36:32.96 --> 00:36:37.96
I felt no remorse for the two NVA had killed an hour ago, but the sight of a dead American,

495
00:36:37.96 --> 00:36:43.96
especially a friend, created a range of emotions from deep sadness to extreme anger toward the enemy.

496
00:36:43.96 --> 00:36:48.96
One of the first rules you are taught when you arrive in country is not to get close to anyone,

497
00:36:48.96 --> 00:36:51.96
but there's no way you can prevent it.

498
00:36:51.96 --> 00:36:58.96
We covered them with ponchos and wandered to where and wondered where the bad guys were.

499
00:36:58.96 --> 00:37:02.96
My next problem was the pilots. They were still out there alone.

500
00:37:02.96 --> 00:37:08.96
I took 14 members and moved cautiously to their location and established a security force around them.

501
00:37:08.96 --> 00:37:14.96
To get everyone out, I would have to blow down some trees and bring in some helicopter gunships to suppress enemy fire,

502
00:37:14.96 --> 00:37:17.96
while everyone was hoisted up into helicopters.

503
00:37:17.96 --> 00:37:26.96
I had been able to contact the rear using the team's radio and had the necessary demolitions on the way.

504
00:37:26.96 --> 00:37:31.96
You and this, not only with some other person's gun and four magazines,

505
00:37:31.96 --> 00:37:34.96
you also didn't even have a radio.

506
00:37:34.96 --> 00:37:39.96
Nothing. That was not good.

507
00:37:39.96 --> 00:37:43.96
By the time the helicopter arrived with the demolitions, the weather was closing in.

508
00:37:43.96 --> 00:37:45.96
Man, this is just Murphy's Law.

509
00:37:45.96 --> 00:37:51.96
The weather was closing in. The rain was coming down harder and the clouds were moving down the mountain.

510
00:37:51.96 --> 00:37:56.96
We would have to work fast just to beat the weather. The enemy had been quiet until the arrival of a helicopter.

511
00:37:56.96 --> 00:37:59.96
Now we could hear them all around us shooting up at the helicopter.

512
00:37:59.96 --> 00:38:03.96
About the time the demolitions came crashing to the ground, the gunships arrived.

513
00:38:03.96 --> 00:38:09.96
We signaled our location and I had the sergeant begin to work working air strikes all around us.

514
00:38:09.96 --> 00:38:16.96
While the gunships were keeping the enemy busy, I carried 50 pounds of C4, blasting caps, time fuse and debt cord to it.

515
00:38:16.96 --> 00:38:19.96
Location near the pilots. I placed enough of them.

516
00:38:19.96 --> 00:38:21.96
I placed enough of the demolitions on trees and dropped them.

517
00:38:21.96 --> 00:38:28.96
This opened up a large enough hole in the canopy to give us a better chance of not having a repeat of the last jungle penetrator incident.

518
00:38:28.96 --> 00:38:32.96
So you, I mean, this is taking time.

519
00:38:32.96 --> 00:38:39.96
This is a, I mean to sit there in rig 50 pounds of demo on a bunch of trees and then put the blasting caps in.

520
00:38:39.96 --> 00:38:43.96
This is like, this is taking what? A half an hour to get this done.

521
00:38:43.96 --> 00:38:47.96
Yeah, probably. But you know, I didn't use all 50 pounds.

522
00:38:47.96 --> 00:38:51.96
That is part of just enough to cut the tree on it and get them down.

523
00:38:51.96 --> 00:38:57.96
But yeah, they all had to be rigged. You had to take the things under the trees, put the blasting caps in and set them off.

524
00:38:57.96 --> 00:39:00.96
They had to make sure they were not going to fall the wrong way.

525
00:39:00.96 --> 00:39:03.96
But, you know, that's why they called me dynamite.

526
00:39:03.96 --> 00:39:09.96
So I like to, I like to blow things up.

527
00:39:09.96 --> 00:39:15.96
The CH47 that had dropped the demolitions returned and hovered over the hole.

528
00:39:15.96 --> 00:39:19.96
As a began to lower the jungle penetrator, the enemy ground fire increased dramatically.

529
00:39:19.96 --> 00:39:23.96
And both door gunners open fire with their 50 caliber machine guns.

530
00:39:23.96 --> 00:39:26.96
Not only could we hear the very loud slow distinctive sound.

531
00:39:26.96 --> 00:39:30.96
But the 50 caliber casings began to rain down on us.

532
00:39:30.96 --> 00:39:33.96
After falling 150 feet, that enough velocity to do a lot of damage.

533
00:39:33.96 --> 00:39:37.96
We could see large red tracer's penetrating deep into the jungle.

534
00:39:37.96 --> 00:39:43.96
The two gun chips were now raining bullets down through the trees with their miniguns up to 4,000 rounds a minute per gun.

535
00:39:43.96 --> 00:39:50.96
Firing 40 millimeter grenades and 2.75 inch rockets with 17 pound high explosive warheads.

536
00:39:50.96 --> 00:39:59.96
The popping and cracking sound of the bullets and explosions of the grenades and rockets were exacerbated by falling tree limbs and trap them flying in every direction.

537
00:39:59.96 --> 00:40:02.96
The darkening sky made the tracers appear very bright.

538
00:40:02.96 --> 00:40:10.96
The hot wet jungle air was becoming smoky and filled with the smell of burned cordite and gunpowder.

539
00:40:10.96 --> 00:40:17.96
That's enough firepower going down range.

540
00:40:17.96 --> 00:40:19.96
You can't simulate that.

541
00:40:19.96 --> 00:40:23.96
The guv watched the craziest hollywood movie and they don't make it look like what that's.

542
00:40:23.96 --> 00:40:28.96
What that's what you just described right there.

543
00:40:28.96 --> 00:40:35.96
By the time the jungle penetrator reached the ground, we had drugged the co-pilot and crew chief over to where it landed.

544
00:40:35.96 --> 00:40:39.96
We strapped them on as quickly as possible and signaled to pull them up.

545
00:40:39.96 --> 00:40:45.96
There was no way to support the broken leg and we could hear the copilot screams over the battle sounds as he was going up.

546
00:40:45.96 --> 00:40:50.96
They say that a compound fracture of the femur is one of the most painful wounds you can have.

547
00:40:50.96 --> 00:40:53.96
After seeing the pain he was in, I believe it.

548
00:40:53.96 --> 00:40:56.96
The trip up took about 2 minutes.

549
00:40:56.96 --> 00:41:04.96
We sent another two crew members up next followed by the wounded team members, the lieutenant colonel and the two dead.

550
00:41:04.96 --> 00:41:08.96
The CH-47 left to take them to the hospital.

551
00:41:08.96 --> 00:41:12.96
So now you just jump into the CH-47 returned about an hour.

552
00:41:12.96 --> 00:41:14.96
During that hour, what's happening?

553
00:41:14.96 --> 00:41:16.96
Are you guys the enemy pressuring you?

554
00:41:16.96 --> 00:41:19.96
The gun chips are having an impact now.

555
00:41:19.96 --> 00:41:20.96
Got it.

556
00:41:20.96 --> 00:41:25.96
When they saw the CH-47 leave, that took some of the pressure all.

557
00:41:25.96 --> 00:41:27.96
They really wanted to knock it down.

558
00:41:27.96 --> 00:41:28.96
Got it.

559
00:41:28.96 --> 00:41:33.96
But the massive air support that you're getting is definitely put in a hurt known the enemy.

560
00:41:33.96 --> 00:41:38.96
I mean, that is, that's a lot of gunfire coming their way.

561
00:41:38.96 --> 00:41:39.96
Rock, it's the whole nine yards.

562
00:41:39.96 --> 00:41:47.96
The CH-47 returned in about an hour with a set of fresh gun chips to help begin extracting us.

563
00:41:47.96 --> 00:41:51.96
I began putting the team members on as fast as I could while the sergeant continued to work.

564
00:41:51.96 --> 00:41:56.96
The air strikes, the jungle forward become mud and was making the job of hooking people up much more difficult.

565
00:41:56.96 --> 00:41:59.96
Eventually there were just the sergeant in my self left on the ground.

566
00:41:59.96 --> 00:42:05.96
Unfortunately, some of the bad guys had moved up close to our position and were beginning to fire at the helicopter.

567
00:42:05.96 --> 00:42:09.96
We knew we'd be exposed to their fire as we ascended.

568
00:42:09.96 --> 00:42:10.96
We thought we had two options.

569
00:42:10.96 --> 00:42:15.96
Go find them and take them out or chance being hoisted up with them shooting at us.

570
00:42:15.96 --> 00:42:21.96
The pilot narrowed our options by saying the clouds were beginning to cover the whole up and it was now or never.

571
00:42:21.96 --> 00:42:27.96
We strapped ourselves on and fired behind each other's backs as we slowly moved skyward spinning,

572
00:42:27.96 --> 00:42:31.96
slowly and swinging back and forth and watching the tracer coming by.

573
00:42:31.96 --> 00:42:36.96
It seemed like it took an hour to make the trip up although it was probably only about two minutes.

574
00:42:36.96 --> 00:42:47.96
Once inside an unstrapped from the jungle penetrator, I rolled over on my back, closed my eyes, and set a prayer of thanks.

575
00:42:47.96 --> 00:42:53.96
There was an atmosphere of elation as you were flying away from the encounter such as this.

576
00:42:53.96 --> 00:42:57.96
The team members were exchanging war stories.

577
00:42:57.96 --> 00:42:59.96
Personally, I was too tired to say much.

578
00:42:59.96 --> 00:43:04.96
My mind turned to rest in recuperation and how I was going to make sure that I got rest tomorrow.

579
00:43:04.96 --> 00:43:08.96
The team leader was also particularly quiet.

580
00:43:08.96 --> 00:43:13.96
Upon arrival at the compound, we were greeted by a small crowd who welcomed us back.

581
00:43:13.96 --> 00:43:19.96
It was a really good feeling to be back and to pick up my weapon and ammunition that we're leaning against the connex container.

582
00:43:19.96 --> 00:43:25.96
We had been taught in Ranger School to never get more than an arms-lined from your weapon.

583
00:43:25.96 --> 00:43:27.96
I would not make that mistake again.

584
00:43:27.96 --> 00:43:33.96
Less than learn to every troop or out there, don't ever do it, not even for a second.

585
00:43:33.96 --> 00:43:38.96
I moved directly to the dispensary to have my injuries treated.

586
00:43:38.96 --> 00:43:43.96
They treated my hands and other cuts and bruises and told me to return the next day.

587
00:43:43.96 --> 00:43:48.96
As I left the dispensary, I was told that the Colonel wanted to see me in the mess hall.

588
00:43:48.96 --> 00:43:53.96
Maybe he was going to give me an extra day of R&R to make up for this one.

589
00:43:53.96 --> 00:43:57.96
So, you're pretty much smoked at this point.

590
00:43:57.96 --> 00:44:00.96
And I actually had two broken ribs.

591
00:44:00.96 --> 00:44:02.96
We just covered.

592
00:44:02.96 --> 00:44:06.96
Well, when you drop 150 feet through the jungle canopy,

593
00:44:06.96 --> 00:44:13.96
the Colonel was sitting at his table with another full-corner,

594
00:44:13.96 --> 00:44:18.96
and the Colonel, non-special forces, and seemed to be having a heated conversation.

595
00:44:18.96 --> 00:44:23.96
When they looked up at me, they saw wet, muddy and bloody person standing in front of them.

596
00:44:23.96 --> 00:44:27.96
The expression on their faces indicated that they had lost their appetites.

597
00:44:27.96 --> 00:44:33.96
He congratulated me on doing a good job, and then he told me what key in the other Colonel had been arguing about.

598
00:44:33.96 --> 00:44:36.96
We had left the crew member from the first crash on the ground.

599
00:44:36.96 --> 00:44:41.96
Apparently there had been a crew chief in the aircraft who had been killed and burned in the wreckage.

600
00:44:41.96 --> 00:44:46.96
The Lieutenant Colonel had told us that he was missing a person.

601
00:44:46.96 --> 00:44:52.96
The Colonel told me to get my team together and be prepared to launch a first light to go in and recover the true crew chief's body,

602
00:44:52.96 --> 00:44:54.96
and destroy the second helicopter.

603
00:44:54.96 --> 00:44:59.96
There was a concern that the helicopter had its communication equipment and codes intact.

604
00:44:59.96 --> 00:45:04.96
These needed to be destroyed before the enemy could make use of them.

605
00:45:04.96 --> 00:45:08.96
The news that I had to go back out there the next morning was not what I wanted to hear.

606
00:45:08.96 --> 00:45:13.96
I was tired, injured, and not sure if I could find enough of my team to do the job.

607
00:45:13.96 --> 00:45:15.96
At any rate, it would be a long night.

608
00:45:15.96 --> 00:45:21.96
On the way to the shower, I found one of my guys and told them to assemble as many team members as he could while I shoured.

609
00:45:21.96 --> 00:45:28.96
The shower was great even though I found three fat leeches that had crawled under my shirt and attached myself to the attachment cells to my body.

610
00:45:28.96 --> 00:45:31.96
They were having a feast on my at my expense.

611
00:45:31.96 --> 00:45:34.96
A squad of insect repellent made them turn loose.

612
00:45:34.96 --> 00:45:37.96
So your team was your team all on our and our at this point?

613
00:45:37.96 --> 00:45:44.96
Fortunately, the majority of them were still out of there in the compound.

614
00:45:44.96 --> 00:45:48.96
Fortunately, I guess.

615
00:45:48.96 --> 00:45:51.96
Maybe not fortunately for them.

616
00:45:51.96 --> 00:45:53.96
Fortunately for the team.

617
00:45:53.96 --> 00:46:03.96
Later that night we moved the team members who were going onto the mission into the isolation area and made our plan for first light launch.

618
00:46:03.96 --> 00:46:10.96
When I woke it was raining cats and dogs outside and the wind was blowing hard, the weather continued like this for the next two days.

619
00:46:10.96 --> 00:46:13.96
The delay gave me time to rest and heal before we inserted.

620
00:46:13.96 --> 00:46:17.96
The drawback to the delay was that it gave the enemy more time to discover the body.

621
00:46:17.96 --> 00:46:19.96
They knew we would make an effort to recover it.

622
00:46:19.96 --> 00:46:22.96
They typically booby trapped the body placed.

623
00:46:22.96 --> 00:46:27.96
Others in the area and likes to plan an ambush to get us on the way out.

624
00:46:27.96 --> 00:46:32.96
I had been on several body recovery missions in the past and knew what to expect.

625
00:46:32.96 --> 00:46:36.96
The morning of the third day the weather had lifted and it was time for the insertion.

626
00:46:36.96 --> 00:46:40.96
We loaded up our helicopters and departed for the launch site while it was still dark.

627
00:46:40.96 --> 00:46:47.96
At the launch site we attended the mission briefing with the gunship pilots forwarder control of our pilots and the launch site personnel.

628
00:46:47.96 --> 00:46:58.96
It was a very detailed briefing with everything from the angles of attack, suspected enemy ground forces and fire locations, code words and the teams route to the helicopter, objective discussed in detail.

629
00:46:58.96 --> 00:47:01.96
Shortly after that, we were given the word to load up.

630
00:47:01.96 --> 00:47:04.96
At this point in the operation the adrenaline begins to flow.

631
00:47:04.96 --> 00:47:16.96
You've just made three trips to the latrine and now you have to, and now you have all your equipment on, you need to go once again.

632
00:47:16.96 --> 00:47:24.96
You can hear the slow, high pitched wind of the helicopter engine starting to get up and get faster and faster.

633
00:47:24.96 --> 00:47:30.96
You smell the camouflage paint and insect repellent on your face and JP4 in the air and you know it's time.

634
00:47:30.96 --> 00:47:38.96
I gave the team the signal to lock and load, put the safety on and climb it to the helicopters.

635
00:47:38.96 --> 00:47:45.96
Their engines were now turning at full RPM as were our hearts and they were ready to lift off.

636
00:47:45.96 --> 00:47:50.96
As we began to lift up and move forward we received the thumbs up from the launch team personnel on the ground.

637
00:47:50.96 --> 00:47:59.96
I was sitting in the door with my feet hanging outside so I could get a clear view of the landing zone on the way in and be the first to hit the ground when we arrived.

638
00:47:59.96 --> 00:48:04.96
A adrenaline flow and at this point, huh?

639
00:48:04.96 --> 00:48:05.96
Yes.

640
00:48:05.96 --> 00:48:09.96
And you're considering this is pretty much guaranteed to be a hot insert.

641
00:48:09.96 --> 00:48:15.96
That they might not hit us on the LZ but they definitely wouldn't once we got down to where the wreckage was.

642
00:48:15.96 --> 00:48:20.96
Was your plan to insert right on the crash sites or were you going to insert somewhere offset?

643
00:48:20.96 --> 00:48:24.96
We went in on top of the ridge and then worked our way down.

644
00:48:24.96 --> 00:48:25.96
Okay, so it wasn't offset.

645
00:48:25.96 --> 00:48:27.96
How was the distance?

646
00:48:27.96 --> 00:48:29.96
Two or three hundred meters.

647
00:48:29.96 --> 00:48:30.96
Okay, but it's so close.

648
00:48:30.96 --> 00:48:32.96
It was far but yeah.

649
00:48:32.96 --> 00:48:38.96
In my day we would an offset insert would be a couple kilometers away.

650
00:48:38.96 --> 00:48:41.96
Two hundred meters a week and sit at that on the x.

651
00:48:41.96 --> 00:48:43.96
I mean pretty damn close.

652
00:48:43.96 --> 00:48:44.96
Two hundred meters.

653
00:48:44.96 --> 00:48:45.96
I'll go in the jungle.

654
00:48:45.96 --> 00:48:48.96
It couldn't take you some time to get two or three hundred meters.

655
00:48:48.96 --> 00:48:49.96
How long would it take?

656
00:48:49.96 --> 00:48:52.96
How long would you plan for it to take you to get two hundred three hundred meters?

657
00:48:52.96 --> 00:48:54.96
Well, we were right from the beginning.

658
00:48:54.96 --> 00:48:57.96
We were expecting the ambush any any second.

659
00:48:57.96 --> 00:49:04.96
So, you know, you're back down to the hundred yards on an hour kind of thing.

660
00:49:04.96 --> 00:49:06.96
So you're going very slowly down through there.

661
00:49:06.96 --> 00:49:10.96
You know, plus it's very wet as muddy as slippery.

662
00:49:10.96 --> 00:49:13.96
You're going downhill to get down to it.

663
00:49:13.96 --> 00:49:16.96
And you're just expecting them to be anywhere.

664
00:49:16.96 --> 00:49:23.96
And the first light, when you guys be taking off the helicopters in the dark and first light is when the extraction goes.

665
00:49:23.96 --> 00:49:28.96
When the insertion goes or are you not taking off until there's a little bit of light out.

666
00:49:28.96 --> 00:49:31.96
There's a little bit of light on this particular mission.

667
00:49:35.96 --> 00:49:37.96
Here we go after about 20 minutes of flight.

668
00:49:37.96 --> 00:49:40.96
Two cobergunships came by us one on each side.

669
00:49:40.96 --> 00:49:48.96
They were going to the LZ ahead of us and make a low slow pass to try and draw fire from the enemy if they were there on the LZ.

670
00:49:48.96 --> 00:49:50.96
There were two other cobras trailing just behind us.

671
00:49:50.96 --> 00:49:53.96
Ready to open fire on enemy positions if we made a mistake.

672
00:49:53.96 --> 00:49:56.96
If we made the mistake of firing on the first two.

673
00:49:56.96 --> 00:49:59.96
We had not anticipated the LZ to be hot.

674
00:49:59.96 --> 00:50:05.96
So we were going to, so we're not going to prep it, meaning that the gun ships would shoot them up.

675
00:50:05.96 --> 00:50:10.96
We wanted to get in as unobtrusively as possible.

676
00:50:10.96 --> 00:50:16.96
To the degree you can with two helicopters, four gun ships and a four-air controller flying around over the LZ.

677
00:50:16.96 --> 00:50:18.96
So the enemy's going to know that you're there.

678
00:50:18.96 --> 00:50:21.96
They're going to know we're coming back.

679
00:50:21.96 --> 00:50:28.96
Soon the crew chief gave me a thumbs up indicating the LZ was cold and we were going in.

680
00:50:28.96 --> 00:50:33.96
We began to lose altitude very quickly as we made our way toward the small clearing on the red line.

681
00:50:33.96 --> 00:50:36.96
As we descended, the air became warmer and humid.

682
00:50:36.96 --> 00:50:40.96
We only turned on to the final approach and began our descent.

683
00:50:40.96 --> 00:50:43.96
I could feel the helicopter began to vibrate and my heart rate increased.

684
00:50:43.96 --> 00:50:46.96
We all scanned the tree line vigorously for signs of the enemy.

685
00:50:46.96 --> 00:50:51.96
All of a sudden we were only two or three feet off the ground and the crew chief was motioning for us to get off.

686
00:50:51.96 --> 00:50:54.96
I jumped in the waist high grass and went down to a prone position.

687
00:50:54.96 --> 00:51:00.96
The team members quickly followed and the helicopter helicopters all flew off to a rendezvous point.

688
00:51:00.96 --> 00:51:05.96
The sound of them disappearing in the distance created a very lonely feeling.

689
00:51:05.96 --> 00:51:11.96
We moved quickly into the tree line and set up a small security perimeter to let our eyes ears and nose adjust to the environment.

690
00:51:11.96 --> 00:51:15.96
This is an extremely important part of survival in the jungle.

691
00:51:15.96 --> 00:51:22.96
The sounds or lack of sounds of bugs, birds and animals as well as the smells tell you what's going on.

692
00:51:22.96 --> 00:51:27.96
You must read these signs correctly if you are to survive.

693
00:51:27.96 --> 00:51:32.96
After about 15 minutes we radioed at Team OK moving east.

694
00:51:32.96 --> 00:51:39.96
This meant we had not detected any signs of the enemy and it was OK to release the helicopters and gunships to return to base.

695
00:51:39.96 --> 00:51:41.96
We were really on our own now.

696
00:51:41.96 --> 00:51:46.96
The Thunder policy in our unit was that teams would always have at least two Americans with them when they were on the ground.

697
00:51:46.96 --> 00:51:52.96
This was a team I had been training to operate on special missions without any Americans.

698
00:51:52.96 --> 00:51:56.96
They were still in training and I was the only American on the team.

699
00:51:56.96 --> 00:52:02.96
This added to the isolation effect.

700
00:52:02.96 --> 00:52:06.96
Do they have any English speakers that were good enough to call for fire?

701
00:52:06.96 --> 00:52:08.96
The interpreter?

702
00:52:08.96 --> 00:52:09.96
Yeah.

703
00:52:09.96 --> 00:52:12.96
Did you have a cross train with those guys?

704
00:52:12.96 --> 00:52:14.96
Did they call for fire with the interpreter?

705
00:52:14.96 --> 00:52:15.96
Some.

706
00:52:15.96 --> 00:52:17.96
But not enough.

707
00:52:17.96 --> 00:52:28.96
Yeah, I think when you say this is a lonely isolating thing, I think that's the understatement of this entry.

708
00:52:28.96 --> 00:52:38.96
But sometimes my thoughts were if it's just me.

709
00:52:38.96 --> 00:52:41.96
I'm the one I have to worry about.

710
00:52:41.96 --> 00:52:46.96
If you're with me, now I have to make sure that I protect you.

711
00:52:46.96 --> 00:52:49.96
I have to make sure that I get you out if you're hit.

712
00:52:49.96 --> 00:52:56.96
I pick up these additional responsibilities when I have other Americans with me.

713
00:52:56.96 --> 00:53:04.96
But if it's just me and the team and I go down, I go down.

714
00:53:04.96 --> 00:53:15.96
Even the previous one where I went in alone, it was a unique feeling to know.

715
00:53:15.96 --> 00:53:17.96
I was the bright light team.

716
00:53:17.96 --> 00:53:20.96
One person, bright light team.

717
00:53:20.96 --> 00:53:25.96
There were other times where I suggested that I might either go in alone on a mission.

718
00:53:25.96 --> 00:53:29.96
Or go in with one or two other people.

719
00:53:29.96 --> 00:53:31.96
Because I don't have a problem.

720
00:53:31.96 --> 00:53:34.96
It'd be an alone out there.

721
00:53:34.96 --> 00:53:37.96
So, that didn't do that.

722
00:53:37.96 --> 00:53:43.96
But the burden of responsibility of the other person is so heavy.

723
00:53:43.96 --> 00:53:45.96
And it's hard to get them out.

724
00:53:45.96 --> 00:53:51.96
I mean, that's why you have so many missing in action from the stock teams.

725
00:53:51.96 --> 00:53:55.96
You can't get them. They get hit and you're being overrun.

726
00:53:55.96 --> 00:53:57.96
You can't get back to get them.

727
00:53:57.96 --> 00:54:00.96
And they might still be alive.

728
00:54:00.96 --> 00:54:04.96
And everybody says no man left behind.

729
00:54:04.96 --> 00:54:13.96
But you got to decide, you come to that decision point where do I leave Jocco and save the team?

730
00:54:13.96 --> 00:54:22.96
Are you sure you're going to get us all killed trying to get your body out?

731
00:54:22.96 --> 00:54:25.96
And my position, I'm not going to get everybody killed.

732
00:54:25.96 --> 00:54:30.96
If I can get you out, reasonably, I will, but if I can't.

733
00:54:30.96 --> 00:54:31.96
Yeah.

734
00:54:31.96 --> 00:54:33.96
And what would I want you to do?

735
00:54:33.96 --> 00:54:36.96
Because I don't want you to get anybody killed trying to get my body out.

736
00:54:36.96 --> 00:54:37.96
I know. That's what I'm saying.

737
00:54:37.96 --> 00:54:38.96
Leave me.

738
00:54:38.96 --> 00:54:45.96
I'll, whatever, doesn't matter anymore. Take care of the rest of the team.

739
00:54:45.96 --> 00:54:48.96
Back to this document.

740
00:54:48.96 --> 00:54:52.96
From here, our plan called for us to work our way down the side of the mountains.

741
00:54:52.96 --> 00:54:59.96
Find the crash site, recover the body, destroy the second helicopter and move to an alternate landing zone for extraction.

742
00:54:59.96 --> 00:55:04.96
Altogether, it should be a very simple mission that should take about five to six hours.

743
00:55:04.96 --> 00:55:07.96
Then I could get started on my honor and honor.

744
00:55:07.96 --> 00:55:13.96
We moved very consciously down the steep wet mountainside with every step you expected to hit a booby trap or have an ambush open up on you.

745
00:55:13.96 --> 00:55:16.96
When, when on the ground, no one talked.

746
00:55:16.96 --> 00:55:20.96
Hand-norm communities signals were all the team communications we used.

747
00:55:20.96 --> 00:55:25.96
Silence was critical. Every foot placement was deliberate so as to avoid any noise.

748
00:55:25.96 --> 00:55:29.96
A broken twig would signal the enemy of your approach.

749
00:55:29.96 --> 00:55:32.96
After about an hour we stopped for a break.

750
00:55:32.96 --> 00:55:38.96
We filmed a small parade and some very thick brush and put out claymore mines, aimed in four directions.

751
00:55:38.96 --> 00:55:46.96
I laid back on my rucksack and tried to relax while constantly looking for any movement and listening for out-for out-of-place sounds.

752
00:55:46.96 --> 00:55:52.96
All of a sudden I heard what seemed to be a very loud pop and pssss.

753
00:55:52.96 --> 00:55:55.96
Everyone hugged the ground. Everyone except Huang.

754
00:55:55.96 --> 00:56:03.96
He had brought a coke with him against my very strict orders. If looks could kill he would have been dead.

755
00:56:03.96 --> 00:56:07.96
He may have just compromised the safety of the entire team and mission.

756
00:56:07.96 --> 00:56:11.96
I took the coke buried it and then we moved out.

757
00:56:11.96 --> 00:56:16.96
About 30 minutes later we knew we were close to the crash site that smell of a decaying body was very strong.

758
00:56:16.96 --> 00:56:20.96
You could see the change in the expressions on everyone's faces.

759
00:56:20.96 --> 00:56:24.96
If the bad guys were going to get us, it would be around the crash site.

760
00:56:24.96 --> 00:56:28.96
We began to move more slowly and cautiously.

761
00:56:28.96 --> 00:56:32.96
Finally I could see the sunlight coming up through the hole in the jungle canopy.

762
00:56:32.96 --> 00:56:35.96
We stopped just short of it and set on a two-man recon team.

763
00:56:35.96 --> 00:56:38.96
They returned without seeing any signs of the enemy.

764
00:56:38.96 --> 00:56:41.96
I knew they were out there. I just didn't know where.

765
00:56:41.96 --> 00:56:46.96
I set up security around the crash site and stepped into the opening.

766
00:56:46.96 --> 00:56:51.96
There was no doubt my mind that there would be mines and or booby traps in the wreckage.

767
00:56:51.96 --> 00:56:56.96
Not only would I have to watch for these but I would be standing in the open as I recovered the body.

768
00:56:56.96 --> 00:57:02.96
A perfect target for a sniper. I could see large concentrations of flies toward the center of the wreckage.

769
00:57:02.96 --> 00:57:07.96
Upon careful observation I saw what looked to be a bone sticking up.

770
00:57:07.96 --> 00:57:12.96
I cautiously made my way to the location of the bone while trying to maintain a low profile.

771
00:57:12.96 --> 00:57:15.96
Another part of our mission was to photograph everything.

772
00:57:15.96 --> 00:57:20.96
I did this quickly and began slowly on to slowly uncover the remains of the body.

773
00:57:20.96 --> 00:57:27.96
Did you have someone assigned for look to look for booby traps or was it just every man was constantly on guard and on guard?

774
00:57:27.96 --> 00:57:33.96
Everybody was looking for it as we moved along but as I went out there it was me.

775
00:57:33.96 --> 00:57:38.96
What were you put to feet? What's for wires? What's for anything?

776
00:57:38.96 --> 00:57:40.96
You know what abnormal?

777
00:57:40.96 --> 00:57:45.96
One thing that happened was it had rain hard.

778
00:57:45.96 --> 00:57:50.96
All the powder and materials like that from the fire.

779
00:57:50.96 --> 00:57:59.96
It washed away so you had mostly pieces of metal, bigger pieces of metal things that you could see easier than you could.

780
00:57:59.96 --> 00:58:04.96
When it was all covered with the powder and stuff.

781
00:58:04.96 --> 00:58:13.96
The crew chief had died face down in the middle of the wreckage and the intense heat of the burning aircraft had burned him into a small charred piece of meat.

782
00:58:13.96 --> 00:58:17.96
His legs were completely gone from the knees down.

783
00:58:17.96 --> 00:58:22.96
His arms were gone from the elbows out and something aluminum had melted and burned through his head.

784
00:58:22.96 --> 00:58:26.96
When I touched what was left of his skull had disintegrated into white powder.

785
00:58:26.96 --> 00:58:31.96
As I was trying to retrieve his torso from the wreckage it broke in half at the lower back.

786
00:58:31.96 --> 00:58:36.96
When it did some of the liquid decay flew into my face, some of it on my lips. I almost lost at this point.

787
00:58:36.96 --> 00:58:41.96
It was almost impossible to breathe and just as hard not to throw up after a few minutes.

788
00:58:41.96 --> 00:58:46.96
I was able to get it on a poncho and move back into the woodland wood vine.

789
00:58:46.96 --> 00:58:51.96
I'd seen people burn to death before but never to this extent.

790
00:58:51.96 --> 00:58:57.96
Now that the body had been recovered we had to find the jungle penetrator and photograph it.

791
00:58:57.96 --> 00:59:02.96
The aviation unit did not believe the cable had broken where I'd said it had.

792
00:59:02.96 --> 00:59:08.96
They wanted photographic evidence before we could do this however someone had to be assigned to carry the body.

793
00:59:08.96 --> 00:59:11.96
No one wanted to in fact they wanted to leave it behind.

794
00:59:11.96 --> 00:59:14.96
I became somewhat forceful and directed whang to carry it.

795
00:59:14.96 --> 00:59:17.96
This was part of his punishment for the coke.

796
00:59:17.96 --> 00:59:21.96
It took only a few minutes to find and photograph the jungle penetrator.

797
00:59:21.96 --> 00:59:24.96
Now it was time to move to the other helicopter.

798
00:59:24.96 --> 00:59:28.96
Blowing this one up was going to be the highlight of the mission for me.

799
00:59:28.96 --> 00:59:34.96
I always enjoyed missions where I got to use demolitions. My only concern was where were the bad guys.

800
00:59:34.96 --> 00:59:40.96
We recovered the demolitions left over for three days ago and carried them to the other crash site.

801
00:59:40.96 --> 00:59:47.96
I was really beginning to get the sixth sense feeling that you have just before everything breaks loose.

802
00:59:47.96 --> 00:59:49.96
Everything was too quiet.

803
00:59:49.96 --> 00:59:52.96
The helicopter was down in a small ravine.

804
00:59:52.96 --> 00:59:54.96
A very undefendable place.

805
00:59:54.96 --> 00:59:59.96
Just as I communicated the decision to move the five team members to the top of the ravine,

806
00:59:59.96 --> 01:00:05.96
births of AK-47 fire from about three to four NVA began to hit all around us.

807
01:00:05.96 --> 01:00:10.96
The team returned fire is quickly quickly as they move to the top of the ravine.

808
01:00:10.96 --> 01:00:16.96
Since there were only a few of them, I decided to stay with the helicopter and plant the demolition charges.

809
01:00:16.96 --> 01:00:22.96
The bad guys shooting in us turned out to be the point team for a much larger group.

810
01:00:22.96 --> 01:00:27.96
As I worked feverously to pack 40 pounds of C4 into the appropriate places,

811
01:00:27.96 --> 01:00:35.96
the intensity of fire increased. My hands were beginning to bleed and blood was dripping out of the ends of my fingers and my gloves.

812
01:00:35.96 --> 01:00:39.96
Bullets were now ripping through the floor and the side of the aircraft,

813
01:00:39.96 --> 01:00:43.96
somewhere even hitting the C4 as I packed it against the instrument panel.

814
01:00:43.96 --> 01:00:48.96
Fortunately C4 requires a detonation device like a blasting cap to set it off.

815
01:00:48.96 --> 01:00:54.96
I felt like Houdini inside a chest except instead of swords coming through the sides, I had bullets.

816
01:00:54.96 --> 01:00:58.96
As the battle intensified, I radiowed for help.

817
01:00:58.96 --> 01:01:04.96
The fight was turning into a war and we needed gunships now.

818
01:01:04.96 --> 01:01:14.96
So there you are standing in the millis crashed helicopter trying to pack C4 into get that thing completely destroyed.

819
01:01:14.96 --> 01:01:18.96
Did you ever think when something like that, hey, I got a good idea.

820
01:01:18.96 --> 01:01:21.96
Why don't you guys just drop a bomb on this thing?

821
01:01:21.96 --> 01:01:28.96
And by the way, and also when somebody tells me hey, go search around for this jungle penetrator with a cut cable, then take a picture of it,

822
01:01:28.96 --> 01:01:30.96
I would have some issues with that.

823
01:01:30.96 --> 01:01:32.96
I had a lot of issues with the whole thing.

824
01:01:32.96 --> 01:01:35.96
They should have told me to go, I was there to start with.

825
01:01:35.96 --> 01:01:39.96
You know, the pilot of that aircraft should have said, one of my guys is missing.

826
01:01:39.96 --> 01:01:42.96
You know, he should have never been left there to start with.

827
01:01:42.96 --> 01:01:45.96
He never said there was another person. He said he had everybody.

828
01:01:45.96 --> 01:01:47.96
He didn't.

829
01:01:47.96 --> 01:01:53.96
That guy was was out there. We could have got him out at the same time. We got everybody else out.

830
01:01:53.96 --> 01:02:06.96
So you know, the controversy is is brewing around a lot of things between us and the aviation commander over what's going on.

831
01:02:06.96 --> 01:02:16.96
But now I'm packing you know, the 40 pounds of C4 in there and I've got a few hundred feet of debt cord to that was left over.

832
01:02:16.96 --> 01:02:21.96
So I got that big roller debt cord in there with the C4.

833
01:02:21.96 --> 01:02:24.96
They're shooting, hitting it.

834
01:02:24.96 --> 01:02:29.96
The thing that bothers me about that is, that means it's coming close to me.

835
01:02:29.96 --> 01:02:30.96
Yeah.

836
01:02:30.96 --> 01:02:32.96
That would be all that you do.

837
01:02:32.96 --> 01:02:35.96
And I got the Blasting Cups.

838
01:02:35.96 --> 01:02:42.96
I'm thinking, once I stick the Blasting Cups in the C4, if a bullet hits one of those, this over.

839
01:02:42.96 --> 01:02:52.96
But at some point you got to do that. So had to make the decisions stick a man, ignite the fuses and try to get out.

840
01:02:52.96 --> 01:02:54.96
How long were the fuses?

841
01:02:54.96 --> 01:02:58.96
About three or four minutes, not long at all.

842
01:02:58.96 --> 01:03:01.96
Were the other guys up on the reds line still?

843
01:03:01.96 --> 01:03:01.96
Yeah.

844
01:03:01.96 --> 01:03:02.96
So you're just on us.

845
01:03:02.96 --> 01:03:03.96
Another.

846
01:03:03.96 --> 01:03:04.96
I'm down in there.

847
01:03:04.96 --> 01:03:06.96
Damn dynamite solo mission.

848
01:03:06.96 --> 01:03:07.96
Yeah.

849
01:03:07.96 --> 01:03:15.96
They, I needed them up there because they had a higher angle of fire down on the bad guys to keep them back.

850
01:03:15.96 --> 01:03:18.96
And you know, my plan was to go out there with them.

851
01:03:18.96 --> 01:03:24.96
And that having it in the gully and having us back up on the high ground like that,

852
01:03:24.96 --> 01:03:29.96
put by did some shielding for us from the blast that was going to happen.

853
01:03:29.96 --> 01:03:33.96
I mean, 40 pounds of C4 and a couple of honors for you to debt cord.

854
01:03:33.96 --> 01:03:36.96
It makes a pretty good display.

855
01:03:36.96 --> 01:03:38.96
It goes off.

856
01:03:38.96 --> 01:03:41.96
They're not going to be anything left to the helicopter.

857
01:03:41.96 --> 01:03:43.96
No.

858
01:03:43.96 --> 01:03:44.96
No.

859
01:03:44.96 --> 01:03:53.96
Once you pull that time fuse, by the way, they're better not be anything that it lays your exit from the scene.

860
01:03:53.96 --> 01:03:54.96
No.

861
01:03:54.96 --> 01:03:55.96
I had to get out.

862
01:03:55.96 --> 01:03:57.96
The decision was made.

863
01:03:57.96 --> 01:04:01.96
Once you pop those, he just ignitors the decisions made you got to get out.

864
01:04:01.96 --> 01:04:05.96
You cover that gear back to this document after a few minutes.

865
01:04:05.96 --> 01:04:09.96
Another decision pointed to Ryebdo is time to insert the blasting caps and light the time fuse.

866
01:04:09.96 --> 01:04:16.96
The questions going through my mind were, would a bullet hit one of the caps and detonate the C4 before I could get out and move to a safe distance?

867
01:04:16.96 --> 01:04:19.96
Could I get out without being hit?

868
01:04:19.96 --> 01:04:21.96
I would be completely exposed while climbing out.

869
01:04:21.96 --> 01:04:30.96
If I got out, could I fully run, expose, could I run fully exposed to the bank, climb it 15 feet and get to the team?

870
01:04:30.96 --> 01:04:32.96
That's another horrible thing.

871
01:04:32.96 --> 01:04:39.96
Because once you pull these time fuse, if you get wounded anywhere in that vicinity, you're done.

872
01:04:39.96 --> 01:04:43.96
Yeah.

873
01:04:43.96 --> 01:04:47.96
It became obvious that they knew I was in the helicopter and were moving in on me.

874
01:04:47.96 --> 01:04:48.96
It was now or never.

875
01:04:48.96 --> 01:04:58.96
I inserted two blasting caps into the C4, ignited the two time-fused fuses, climbed out of the side of the helicopter, rolled to the ground, low crawled to the base of the bank and began to climb like a madman.

876
01:04:58.96 --> 01:05:03.96
I'm sure it looked like a contest between me and the enemies' bullets to see which could dig into the ground the most.

877
01:05:03.96 --> 01:05:06.96
It only took a matter of seconds to put it seemed like an eternity.

878
01:05:06.96 --> 01:05:10.96
My team had really increased their volume of fire to help cover me.

879
01:05:10.96 --> 01:05:17.96
As I rolled up on top of the bank, I looked back to see 3 to 5 NVA, run up behind the helicopter.

880
01:05:17.96 --> 01:05:20.96
If I had waited a few more seconds, they would have had me.

881
01:05:20.96 --> 01:05:26.96
Several of the team members looked quickly at me with the same expression of disbelief that I had.

882
01:05:26.96 --> 01:05:34.96
Could they really be hiding behind the helicopter that had 40 pounds of C4 and 200 feet of debt in that court in it with time-fused burning?

883
01:05:34.96 --> 01:05:38.96
Were they going to try and pull the fuses out and save the helicopter?

884
01:05:38.96 --> 01:05:42.96
It quickly came apparent that they did not realize I had been setting charges.

885
01:05:42.96 --> 01:05:50.96
I could see the smoke from the time-fused coming out of the helicopter, but the enemy were so gross in the heat of battle that they did not realize that they were about to become history.

886
01:05:50.96 --> 01:05:54.96
I signaled to the team that it was about time for the explosion.

887
01:05:54.96 --> 01:05:57.96
What happened next was beyond words.

888
01:05:57.96 --> 01:06:02.96
There was a tremendous explosion, producing a giant black fireball followed by a shockwave.

889
01:06:02.96 --> 01:06:08.96
You can actually see the compressed air moving out in a circular pattern that literally dazed all of us.

890
01:06:08.96 --> 01:06:12.96
There was a momentary low in the fire as it began to rain metal.

891
01:06:12.96 --> 01:06:18.96
Pieces of metal rock, dirt, and tree limbs, and the remains of the NVA had been hiding behind the helicopter.

892
01:06:18.96 --> 01:06:22.96
The jungle is filled with black smoke.

893
01:06:22.96 --> 01:06:26.96
I'd wanted a good explosion, and it was a good one.

894
01:06:26.96 --> 01:06:30.96
But I had intended for it to be much further away when it happened.

895
01:06:30.96 --> 01:06:34.96
But I had intended to be much further away when it happened.

896
01:06:34.96 --> 01:06:37.96
The enemy picked up quickly with a new twist.

897
01:06:37.96 --> 01:06:40.96
The enemy fire picked up quickly with a new twist.

898
01:06:40.96 --> 01:06:42.96
So yeah, that's pretty much-

899
01:06:42.96 --> 01:06:44.96
You can't plan that one any better.

900
01:06:44.96 --> 01:06:50.96
The enemy you leave that helicopter with 40 pounds of debt or 40 pounds of C4 and a bunch of debt cord,

901
01:06:50.96 --> 01:06:55.96
which for those of you that don't know debt cord, it's just explosives in a string.

902
01:06:55.96 --> 01:06:58.96
And so when it blows up, it blows up, and it's actually pretty powerful.

903
01:06:58.96 --> 01:07:00.96
It's actually very powerful debt cord.

904
01:07:00.96 --> 01:07:04.96
So these guys were blown away by this explosion.

905
01:07:04.96 --> 01:07:09.96
And all they had to do was see what was going on, walk over and cut the time fuse.

906
01:07:09.96 --> 01:07:11.96
And they would have been all right.

907
01:07:11.96 --> 01:07:14.96
I don't know if they still had time to get inside.

908
01:07:14.96 --> 01:07:19.96
They had to crawl, somebody had to crawl inside to pull it out.

909
01:07:19.96 --> 01:07:23.96
They could have pulled it out and tossed it aside.

910
01:07:23.96 --> 01:07:33.96
But when you're watching time fuse burn, it's not like it all burns up to wherever it's burning.

911
01:07:33.96 --> 01:07:34.96
Everything falls.

912
01:07:34.96 --> 01:07:36.96
It's going down through the middle through the tube.

913
01:07:36.96 --> 01:07:39.96
And you don't know exactly where it is.

914
01:07:39.96 --> 01:07:45.96
And so they might grab it just as it hits the count.

915
01:07:45.96 --> 01:07:49.96
But we didn't know to worry about that.

916
01:07:49.96 --> 01:07:51.96
Worked out.

917
01:07:51.96 --> 01:07:55.96
The enemy fire picked up quickly and with the new twist.

918
01:07:55.96 --> 01:08:00.96
They had moved a machine gun position on the other side of us that we are now in a crossfire.

919
01:08:00.96 --> 01:08:02.96
We were pinned down and couldn't move.

920
01:08:02.96 --> 01:08:05.96
We had to get rid of the machine gun or we were all dead.

921
01:08:05.96 --> 01:08:09.96
There was a small group of rocks about 20 meters from our position.

922
01:08:09.96 --> 01:08:14.96
If I could get to those rocks, I would be able to call back directions to our M79 gunner.

923
01:08:14.96 --> 01:08:17.96
And we might knock out the machine gun.

924
01:08:17.96 --> 01:08:23.96
The problem was getting across the 20 meters of open terrain with fire coming from both sides without getting hit.

925
01:08:23.96 --> 01:08:28.96
They had also brought an RPG and it fired a couple of those at us.

926
01:08:28.96 --> 01:08:31.96
Time was running out.

927
01:08:31.96 --> 01:08:36.96
I told the team to cover me as I went across the ground like a mole watching the mud being dug up all around me.

928
01:08:36.96 --> 01:08:41.96
The only way I could explain not being hit was that got to put a force field around me.

929
01:08:41.96 --> 01:08:45.96
The enemy had begun to shift their fire off of me as I neared the rocks.

930
01:08:45.96 --> 01:08:50.96
This seemed strange but I was glad that I made it.

931
01:08:50.96 --> 01:08:52.96
I didn't think much about it.

932
01:08:52.96 --> 01:08:55.96
The rocks did not provide as much cover as I anticipated they would.

933
01:08:55.96 --> 01:08:58.96
The machine gun had to be dealt with quickly.

934
01:08:58.96 --> 01:09:04.96
I pulled myself over to the edge of the bank and looked over and discovered why the enemy shifted most of their fire off me.

935
01:09:04.96 --> 01:09:08.96
Less than three feet from me was an NVA crawling up the bank to get me.

936
01:09:08.96 --> 01:09:12.96
I didn't know which of all of us had the biggest look of shock on their face.

937
01:09:12.96 --> 01:09:13.96
Probably me.

938
01:09:13.96 --> 01:09:19.96
Time began to move in slow motion and what was reality was two to three seconds seemed like minutes.

939
01:09:19.96 --> 01:09:24.96
In the next fraction of a second, he squeezed the trigger on his AK-47.

940
01:09:24.96 --> 01:09:28.96
The first round just missed my head by what must have been an inch or two.

941
01:09:28.96 --> 01:09:33.96
Powder coming out of the barrel was hitting me in the face as the bullets streamed out.

942
01:09:33.96 --> 01:09:41.96
AK-47s have a tendency to rise up when they are on automatic so that the other bullets were going over my head.

943
01:09:41.96 --> 01:09:46.96
I squeezed off a burst of six to eight rounds from a distance of less than three feet.

944
01:09:46.96 --> 01:09:52.96
They all hit him in the face and the top of his head causing it to explode, sending debris all over me.

945
01:09:52.96 --> 01:09:57.96
As his body tumbled down the bank, I could taste the blood that hit me in the mouth.

946
01:09:57.96 --> 01:10:00.96
The fire immediately shifted back on me.

947
01:10:00.96 --> 01:10:06.96
And I was hugging the ground so close that I must have looked like an empty pair of fatigues lying on the ground.

948
01:10:06.96 --> 01:10:10.96
Nevertheless, I felt an occasional bullet hit my rock sack.

949
01:10:10.96 --> 01:10:12.96
Fortunately, the radio was not damaged.

950
01:10:12.96 --> 01:10:16.96
A green trace or ricochet off a rock and landed right in front of my face.

951
01:10:16.96 --> 01:10:19.96
I watched it lie there and burn.

952
01:10:19.96 --> 01:10:26.96
As I continued to fire at the enemy, the handguard on my car 15 became so hot I could no longer hold it.

953
01:10:26.96 --> 01:10:29.96
I was having to shoot one hand at.

954
01:10:29.96 --> 01:10:32.96
I shouted back directions to the M79 gunner.

955
01:10:32.96 --> 01:10:34.96
His first shot was high and off to the left.

956
01:10:34.96 --> 01:10:38.96
I continued to direct his fire until he hit a tree beside the machine gun,

957
01:10:38.96 --> 01:10:40.96
sending shrapnel into the position.

958
01:10:40.96 --> 01:10:43.96
The two NVA were wounded and momentarily stunned.

959
01:10:43.96 --> 01:10:49.96
This gave me a chance to put 10 to 12 round burst on them and silence the machine gun for good.

960
01:10:55.96 --> 01:10:56.96
Oh man.

961
01:10:56.96 --> 01:10:59.96
It was an exciting afternoon.

962
01:10:59.96 --> 01:11:03.96
Yeah, that's completely crazy.

963
01:11:03.96 --> 01:11:08.96
I can't imagine sitting there as all this machine gun fires happening and the trace or

964
01:11:08.96 --> 01:11:14.96
settles itself and funny your face and you sit there and watch it burn.

965
01:11:14.96 --> 01:11:17.96
About this time, two helicopter gunships arrived.

966
01:11:17.96 --> 01:11:22.96
I marked our position initially with a flare gun and then with purple smoke grenade.

967
01:11:22.96 --> 01:11:27.96
After they had identified our location, I directed their mini gun 40 millimeter grenade and rocket fire into the enemy.

968
01:11:27.96 --> 01:11:31.96
The gunships were literally ripping the trees ground and enemy apart.

969
01:11:31.96 --> 01:11:35.96
Even though we had already killed a lot of enemy, there were still 20 more shooting at us.

970
01:11:35.96 --> 01:11:43.96
The gunship spotted the enemy further down the ridge, moving toward us and fired rockets on them to slow their progress.

971
01:11:43.96 --> 01:11:51.96
I worked the air strikes in as close as I could to our position and eventually was able to suppress the enemy fire enough to crawl back to the team.

972
01:11:51.96 --> 01:11:54.96
So far only one team member had any serious wounds.

973
01:11:54.96 --> 01:11:57.96
Schrappin' off from one of the B40 rockets that hit him in the back.

974
01:11:57.96 --> 01:12:01.96
It was not life-threatening at the moment, but he was in a lot of pain and bleeding.

975
01:12:01.96 --> 01:12:04.96
We were beginning to run low on ammunition.

976
01:12:04.96 --> 01:12:06.96
And the enemy force was increasing.

977
01:12:06.96 --> 01:12:10.96
The time had come to break contact with the enemy or die in place.

978
01:12:10.96 --> 01:12:16.96
Yeah, you were going, in order for your car 15 to get that hot that you put, you were shooting a lot.

979
01:12:16.96 --> 01:12:17.96
Yeah.

980
01:12:17.96 --> 01:12:19.96
How many rounds did you go in with?

981
01:12:19.96 --> 01:12:21.96
I don't know.

982
01:12:21.96 --> 01:12:22.96
Normal on a sog machine.

983
01:12:22.96 --> 01:12:25.96
I used to carry around 50 magazines.

984
01:12:25.96 --> 01:12:26.96
Did you say 50?

985
01:12:26.96 --> 01:12:28.96
50 or 5 zero magazines.

986
01:12:28.96 --> 01:12:31.96
Of course we had the little ones.

987
01:12:31.96 --> 01:12:33.96
Yeah, there was a 20 rounds.

988
01:12:33.96 --> 01:12:34.96
Yeah.

989
01:12:34.96 --> 01:12:35.96
Yeah.

990
01:12:35.96 --> 01:12:41.96
Because even though I was the leader, I still attended to engage the bad guys.

991
01:12:41.96 --> 01:12:43.96
So you're in there, and what about for this one?

992
01:12:43.96 --> 01:12:46.96
Well, you know you're kind of a high potential for contact.

993
01:12:46.96 --> 01:12:53.96
I don't think we had that many. I don't remember exactly how many I had, you know, maybe 30 years old, but, you know, a little less than I had.

994
01:12:53.96 --> 01:12:58.96
How did you even load out 30 30 magazines or 50 magazines?

995
01:12:58.96 --> 01:13:02.96
I mean, you can only fit so many on your web gear.

996
01:13:02.96 --> 01:13:05.96
You, with a canteen, canteen pouch.

997
01:13:05.96 --> 01:13:08.96
You can put 5 20 round magazines in it.

998
01:13:08.96 --> 01:13:13.96
You know, so I would carry two of those at least on the belt.

999
01:13:13.96 --> 01:13:16.96
And then you know, I'd put the others in the rucksack.

1000
01:13:16.96 --> 01:13:19.96
So I'd come to the left side.

1001
01:13:19.96 --> 01:13:22.96
I'd have, you know, 10 magazines.

1002
01:13:22.96 --> 01:13:25.96
You know, because you've got to put the magazine in when you left hand.

1003
01:13:25.96 --> 01:13:26.96
Yeah.

1004
01:13:26.96 --> 01:13:27.96
The right side.

1005
01:13:27.96 --> 01:13:33.96
I'd have one or two bags of grenades because I could put usually five of those in a canteen pouch.

1006
01:13:33.96 --> 01:13:35.96
And you've got to throw right handed.

1007
01:13:35.96 --> 01:13:38.96
You didn't want to have to be rolling and turned.

1008
01:13:38.96 --> 01:13:42.96
I tried not to put anything, you know, besides, you know,

1009
01:13:42.96 --> 01:13:48.96
the the med kit, which was pretty flat, the gals pads and things like that.

1010
01:13:48.96 --> 01:13:50.96
My compass on the front.

1011
01:13:50.96 --> 01:13:53.96
So I could get closer to the ground.

1012
01:13:53.96 --> 01:13:58.96
And then in the rucksack, I was loaded up.

1013
01:13:58.96 --> 01:14:01.96
I was wondering if everything was so heavy.

1014
01:14:01.96 --> 01:14:06.96
And then, you know, you had to have a couple of courts of water on the belt.

1015
01:14:06.96 --> 01:14:10.96
And sometimes more in the rucksack.

1016
01:14:10.96 --> 01:14:13.96
You had to clay more mines in the rucksack.

1017
01:14:13.96 --> 01:14:15.96
How many claymores would you usually carry?

1018
01:14:15.96 --> 01:14:16.96
I used to carry two.

1019
01:14:16.96 --> 01:14:21.96
And depending on the size of the team, we might everybody else might have two.

1020
01:14:21.96 --> 01:14:23.96
But, you know, claymores are heavy.

1021
01:14:23.96 --> 01:14:24.96
Yeah.

1022
01:14:24.96 --> 01:14:24.96
Yeah.

1023
01:14:24.96 --> 01:14:26.96
Would you, would those be rigged?

1024
01:14:26.96 --> 01:14:28.96
The ones rigged with like five seconds or 10 second times.

1025
01:14:28.96 --> 01:14:31.96
We had to, we had to fuse this depending on what we wanted to do with them.

1026
01:14:31.96 --> 01:14:34.96
And then you also had a rig for perimeter security that you can clock off.

1027
01:14:34.96 --> 01:14:35.96
Yeah.

1028
01:14:35.96 --> 01:14:36.96
Yeah.

1029
01:14:38.96 --> 01:14:40.96
We carried a lot of stuff.

1030
01:14:40.96 --> 01:14:41.96
Yeah.

1031
01:14:43.96 --> 01:14:44.96
Yeah.

1032
01:14:44.96 --> 01:14:50.96
It's, uh, to be in these kind of fire fights to shoot your weapon enough that it's hot.

1033
01:14:50.96 --> 01:14:54.96
And to be sitting there under that, under that fire directly.

1034
01:14:54.96 --> 01:14:57.96
And I mean, this is just, this is, these are crazy things.

1035
01:14:57.96 --> 01:14:59.96
You can barely even capture.

1036
01:14:59.96 --> 01:15:04.96
How, how, well, what your chances are survival in such a way.

1037
01:15:04.96 --> 01:15:06.96
So, you know, the chances are not good.

1038
01:15:06.96 --> 01:15:07.96
Let me put it to that way.

1039
01:15:07.96 --> 01:15:13.96
With the, with the original M16, the hand guard would, would get hot.

1040
01:15:13.96 --> 01:15:19.96
But, you know, the regular troops rarely, you know, fired on that much.

1041
01:15:19.96 --> 01:15:20.96
They would get warm.

1042
01:15:20.96 --> 01:15:26.96
But with the car 15, it had a different type of hand guard front.

1043
01:15:26.96 --> 01:15:30.96
And with the amount of firing that we were doing.

1044
01:15:30.96 --> 01:15:33.96
And, you know, the thing was 110 degrees to start.

1045
01:15:33.96 --> 01:15:38.96
And then you start, you know, putting those, you know, rounds through there as fast as you can.

1046
01:15:38.96 --> 01:15:39.96
It very quickly.

1047
01:15:39.96 --> 01:15:43.96
It would get hot, uh, most American tour gloves.

1048
01:15:43.96 --> 01:15:48.96
You know, and I particularly had them on this time because they were just, again, on the inside of my hands.

1049
01:15:48.96 --> 01:15:51.96
A lot of the muscle and beat was gone.

1050
01:15:51.96 --> 01:15:58.96
Um, so, and, and we cut the fingertips out, you know, so we had some dexterity to do things.

1051
01:15:58.96 --> 01:16:02.96
And I would put, uh, piece of canvas around the hand guard.

1052
01:16:02.96 --> 01:16:06.96
And that would just give me a little extra protection to it.

1053
01:16:06.96 --> 01:16:07.96
It got hot.

1054
01:16:07.96 --> 01:16:14.96
And then, you know, just, the one handed thing, having, um, the rope, small rope.

1055
01:16:14.96 --> 01:16:21.96
Go through the little site, bracket up there and hooked into the snap link on your shoulder.

1056
01:16:21.96 --> 01:16:23.96
You could put pressure down on that.

1057
01:16:23.96 --> 01:16:27.96
It made it easier to shoot one handed and be able to hold it down.

1058
01:16:27.96 --> 01:16:30.96
You know, because it's just going to try to come up on auto.

1059
01:16:30.96 --> 01:16:32.96
Um, but you could do that.

1060
01:16:32.96 --> 01:16:36.96
It was a little uncomfortable on that machine because of my hands.

1061
01:16:36.96 --> 01:16:41.96
But the good thing about your hands is all of that scandal grow right back.

1062
01:16:41.96 --> 01:16:42.96
You didn't take it long.

1063
01:16:42.96 --> 01:16:43.96
It'll come back.

1064
01:16:43.96 --> 01:16:47.96
The other places on the body just, they didn't come back that fast.

1065
01:16:47.96 --> 01:16:48.96
For me.

1066
01:16:48.96 --> 01:16:49.96
All right.

1067
01:16:49.96 --> 01:16:51.96
So you guys are running low on ammo.

1068
01:16:51.96 --> 01:16:52.96
And here we go back to this document.

1069
01:16:52.96 --> 01:16:56.96
I signals the team to get ready to move out and radio to the gunship.

1070
01:16:56.96 --> 01:17:01.96
What we're going to do as they made their next run firing minigun 40 millimeter grenades

1071
01:17:01.96 --> 01:17:05.96
and rockets myself and two team members exposed ourselves long enough to throw white

1072
01:17:05.96 --> 01:17:08.96
phosphorous grenades as far toward the enemy as we could.

1073
01:17:08.96 --> 01:17:13.96
When they exploded each productive produced a very dense 30 meter radius of white smoke

1074
01:17:13.96 --> 01:17:16.96
and streams of burning phosphorus.

1075
01:17:16.96 --> 01:17:21.96
The smoke didn't stop the bullets, but it did prevent them from seeing our direction of escape.

1076
01:17:21.96 --> 01:17:29.96
We quickly drugged the body and the wounded team member into the thick jungle and began slipping

1077
01:17:29.96 --> 01:17:31.96
and sliding up the mountain.

1078
01:17:31.96 --> 01:17:37.96
I radio the gunships that we were clear to make their next pass directly over our old position

1079
01:17:37.96 --> 01:17:42.96
marked with a red smoke grenade estimating that the bad guys would be there by then.

1080
01:17:42.96 --> 01:17:46.96
It was a good move resulting in the gunships killing several of them where we had been.

1081
01:17:46.96 --> 01:17:50.96
The gunships continued to pound the area for another 20 minutes sending thousands of bullets

1082
01:17:50.96 --> 01:17:56.96
hundreds of 40 millimeter grenades and dozens of rockets through the jungle canopy onto them.

1083
01:17:56.96 --> 01:18:01.96
Once again the weather moved in on us very quickly and the rain began to come down hard.

1084
01:18:01.96 --> 01:18:05.96
Before we were halfway up the mountain the clouds were already covered.

1085
01:18:05.96 --> 01:18:08.96
The clouds had already covered the ridge line.

1086
01:18:08.96 --> 01:18:11.96
We would not be distracted that day.

1087
01:18:11.96 --> 01:18:16.96
Tired and somewhat demoralized we continued to climb toward the top of the mountain.

1088
01:18:16.96 --> 01:18:20.96
We had at least temporarily burlken contact with the enemy.

1089
01:18:20.96 --> 01:18:23.96
Eventually we found a very dense rocky and steep peak.

1090
01:18:23.96 --> 01:18:25.96
We thought we could defend.

1091
01:18:25.96 --> 01:18:28.96
The rain continued to rest the day and throughout the night.

1092
01:18:28.96 --> 01:18:31.96
That's a morale crusher.

1093
01:18:31.96 --> 01:18:32.96
Yeah.

1094
01:18:32.96 --> 01:18:34.96
Your low on ammunition.

1095
01:18:34.96 --> 01:18:40.96
You think you're making your final movement and then you're going to get extracted

1096
01:18:40.96 --> 01:18:43.96
and then the weather comes in and you're shut down.

1097
01:18:43.96 --> 01:18:46.96
Yeah. It didn't go over well with the team.

1098
01:18:46.96 --> 01:18:55.96
It had a significant impact on them around because they really thought I really thought

1099
01:18:55.96 --> 01:19:01.96
that once we got up here we would get extracted but not once the weather rolled in.

1100
01:19:01.96 --> 01:19:02.96
Then I knew.

1101
01:19:02.96 --> 01:19:09.96
We're going to be here at least until tomorrow and things just don't work out.

1102
01:19:09.96 --> 01:19:18.96
As a leader in that position. What is it important for you to do as a leader as that morale starts to slip?

1103
01:19:18.96 --> 01:19:31.96
Part of what I was doing was congratulating them because this was one of our first heavy fire fights as a team.

1104
01:19:31.96 --> 01:19:36.96
So popping them up, how well they did, how we destroyed all those guys.

1105
01:19:36.96 --> 01:19:39.96
We got the body that we went down after.

1106
01:19:39.96 --> 01:19:44.96
Trying to tell you, you really did a good job.

1107
01:19:44.96 --> 01:19:47.96
So Wayne, don't ever think about it.

1108
01:19:47.96 --> 01:19:52.96
I'm a salt machine again.

1109
01:19:52.96 --> 01:19:59.96
That still, okay. So you give them like a pep talk.

1110
01:19:59.96 --> 01:20:01.96
You did great but they got to be looking at you.

1111
01:20:01.96 --> 01:20:05.96
Hey, thanks a lot boss and now we're here and the enemy that we just killed a bunch of enemy.

1112
01:20:05.96 --> 01:20:08.96
What are they going to do? They're going to come after us.

1113
01:20:08.96 --> 01:20:11.96
We've got to keep the guard up pay attention.

1114
01:20:11.96 --> 01:20:14.96
You can't dwell on what's happened.

1115
01:20:14.96 --> 01:20:16.96
The weather will clear when it clears.

1116
01:20:16.96 --> 01:20:22.96
In the meantime, we got to stay sharp and we're in a good position.

1117
01:20:22.96 --> 01:20:24.96
If they try to come up, we'll take them out.

1118
01:20:24.96 --> 01:20:33.96
This is like the ultimate form of when people get in competition of some kind and they think they win and then it turns out they don't.

1119
01:20:33.96 --> 01:20:37.96
Yeah. I got a buddy named Tim Kennedy who's actually a special force to guide great guide.

1120
01:20:37.96 --> 01:20:40.96
He was actually a UFC fighter.

1121
01:20:40.96 --> 01:20:43.96
A mixed martial arts fighter, incredible fighter.

1122
01:20:43.96 --> 01:20:46.96
But he had a match against a guy.

1123
01:20:46.96 --> 01:20:50.96
And the guy he was going against was an Olympic champion guy.

1124
01:20:50.96 --> 01:20:53.96
It really tough guy and Tim was beating him.

1125
01:20:53.96 --> 01:20:56.96
And I think it was between the second and third round.

1126
01:20:56.96 --> 01:20:59.96
The opponent didn't answer the bell.

1127
01:20:59.96 --> 01:21:02.96
So he didn't come out to fight.

1128
01:21:02.96 --> 01:21:06.96
And then the corner man, there were some shenanigans going on.

1129
01:21:06.96 --> 01:21:12.96
And all of a sudden, with an extra 30 seconds of rest or whatever, the guy stood up and ready to fight.

1130
01:21:12.96 --> 01:21:16.96
And now Tim Kennedy who had just bought he'd won because the guy didn't answer the bell.

1131
01:21:16.96 --> 01:21:18.96
They go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's not over. You got to fight.

1132
01:21:18.96 --> 01:21:20.96
And here and him tell that story to me.

1133
01:21:20.96 --> 01:21:23.96
He said it was this situation, right?

1134
01:21:23.96 --> 01:21:25.96
All of a sudden, he thought he would head won.

1135
01:21:25.96 --> 01:21:26.96
Thought the day was done.

1136
01:21:26.96 --> 01:21:28.96
Raised his hands in victory.

1137
01:21:28.96 --> 01:21:30.96
And then all of a sudden, no, you got to fight again.

1138
01:21:30.96 --> 01:21:35.96
And he didn't, you know, he told me he's like, I didn't get back in the game.

1139
01:21:35.96 --> 01:21:36.96
And he ended up losing that fight.

1140
01:21:36.96 --> 01:21:41.96
And that, unfortunately, that fight would have put him in the slot to be the UFC champion,

1141
01:21:41.96 --> 01:21:43.96
which he absolutely should have been.

1142
01:21:43.96 --> 01:21:49.96
But it's, it reminds me of this and you as a leader have to take these people.

1143
01:21:49.96 --> 01:21:51.96
In that moment where they could let down their guard, they could get them or

1144
01:21:51.96 --> 01:21:54.96
Otherwise they could give up and instead say, no, guess what?

1145
01:21:54.96 --> 01:21:56.96
Okay, hey, good job.

1146
01:21:56.96 --> 01:21:57.96
We got to make a through tonight.

1147
01:21:57.96 --> 01:21:58.96
We're not done yet.

1148
01:21:58.96 --> 01:22:00.96
Yeah. And that happens all the time.

1149
01:22:00.96 --> 01:22:08.96
I mean, cutting him the first, first got to, to be in ace pilot,

1150
01:22:08.96 --> 01:22:15.96
and bring it on, when, when they shot down their, the fifth aircraft.

1151
01:22:15.96 --> 01:22:19.96
And then something, the mission was over, the shot down that, that, that, that

1152
01:22:19.96 --> 01:22:23.96
MIG and they turned and go home and he and, you know, the co-pilot,

1153
01:22:23.96 --> 01:22:26.96
they're patting each other on the back.

1154
01:22:26.96 --> 01:22:28.96
Man, we're ace is now. We've done this.

1155
01:22:28.96 --> 01:22:31.96
That was great. And then just going back and forth,

1156
01:22:31.96 --> 01:22:34.96
they didn't hear the missile alarm go off.

1157
01:22:34.96 --> 01:22:35.96
Eugh.

1158
01:22:35.96 --> 01:22:38.96
Fortunately, they were almost back to the coast.

1159
01:22:38.96 --> 01:22:41.96
When the missile hit them, they had to punch out.

1160
01:22:41.96 --> 01:22:45.96
They landed in the water and, you know, got picked up out there.

1161
01:22:45.96 --> 01:22:48.96
But they were celebrating so hard.

1162
01:22:48.96 --> 01:22:50.96
Yeah. They'd like to guard down.

1163
01:22:50.96 --> 01:22:52.96
They thought it was over.

1164
01:22:52.96 --> 01:22:54.96
And it, it, over till it's over.

1165
01:22:54.96 --> 01:22:58.96
That's right. And in this particular case, it ain't over yet.

1166
01:22:58.96 --> 01:23:00.96
Here we go.

1167
01:23:00.96 --> 01:23:02.96
Back to this document, even though the mission was supposed to

1168
01:23:02.96 --> 01:23:06.96
been a five hour mission, I'd made just everyone, just, I'd made

1169
01:23:06.96 --> 01:23:08.96
everyone bring two meals just in case.

1170
01:23:08.96 --> 01:23:12.96
The team members had grumbled about the extra weight, but no one was grumbling

1171
01:23:12.96 --> 01:23:13.96
now.

1172
01:23:13.96 --> 01:23:17.96
Nor did they during the next day, as the rain continued,

1173
01:23:17.96 --> 01:23:21.96
we spent almost 48 hours on that little peak,

1174
01:23:21.96 --> 01:23:26.96
constantly watching, listening, and feeling for the enemy

1175
01:23:26.96 --> 01:23:29.96
before the weather cleared and we were extracted.

1176
01:23:29.96 --> 01:23:31.96
Neither say everyone was very excited to climb on board.

1177
01:23:31.96 --> 01:23:36.96
The helicopter had for home, even though the smell was terrible.

1178
01:23:36.96 --> 01:23:40.96
I really look forward to seeing, I really, I was really looking forward

1179
01:23:40.96 --> 01:23:44.96
to some time off to let my body and mind heal.

1180
01:23:44.96 --> 01:23:48.96
When we arrived at the compound, however, I discovered my team was scheduled

1181
01:23:48.96 --> 01:23:51.96
to begin preparing for a new mission the next day.

1182
01:23:51.96 --> 01:23:54.96
Our nr would have to wait.

1183
01:23:54.96 --> 01:23:57.96
Three months later, I was awarded the air medal with the V-Device

1184
01:23:57.96 --> 01:24:00.96
second award for heroism during aerial combat for my actions.

1185
01:24:00.96 --> 01:24:02.96
I'm May 4th, 1969.

1186
01:24:02.96 --> 01:24:06.96
The first trip, I was also awarded the bronze star medal with V-Device

1187
01:24:06.96 --> 01:24:12.96
for heroism in ground combat for my actions on May 7th, 1969.

1188
01:24:12.96 --> 01:24:14.96
The second trip.

1189
01:24:14.96 --> 01:24:19.96
And it was worse.

1190
01:24:19.96 --> 01:24:27.96
When I got, well, please tell me, what was worse than that?

1191
01:24:27.96 --> 01:24:33.96
Because whoever wrote up you for a bronze star for that, no disrespect,

1192
01:24:33.96 --> 01:24:38.96
but I'd like to slap that first right in face because that is ridiculous.

1193
01:24:38.96 --> 01:24:41.96
That entire thing is ridiculous.

1194
01:24:41.96 --> 01:24:50.96
So when I got back, we had the aviation guy there with the art colonel again.

1195
01:24:50.96 --> 01:24:56.96
And he's saying, you blew up my helicopter.

1196
01:24:56.96 --> 01:25:01.96
I'm saying, that's what you told me to do.

1197
01:25:01.96 --> 01:25:03.96
Destroy the helicopter.

1198
01:25:03.96 --> 01:25:06.96
He said, I didn't tell you that.

1199
01:25:06.96 --> 01:25:08.96
You were not supposed to destroy it.

1200
01:25:08.96 --> 01:25:12.96
You know, just put a thermo into something on the radio.

1201
01:25:12.96 --> 01:25:14.96
It's not destroy the helicopter.

1202
01:25:14.96 --> 01:25:17.96
I don't know what he thought he was doing with it.

1203
01:25:17.96 --> 01:25:21.96
But that Joker was in a million pieces out there.

1204
01:25:21.96 --> 01:25:23.96
It's gone.

1205
01:25:23.96 --> 01:25:26.96
Next time do it yourself.

1206
01:25:26.96 --> 01:25:28.96
I think like go that far.

1207
01:25:28.96 --> 01:25:30.96
I've been thinking that.

1208
01:25:30.96 --> 01:25:33.96
I was not happy when I heard that.

1209
01:25:33.96 --> 01:25:34.96
I wanted to hear that man.

1210
01:25:34.96 --> 01:25:35.96
He did a great job.

1211
01:25:35.96 --> 01:25:39.96
Yeah.

1212
01:25:39.96 --> 01:25:41.96
Why did you blow my helicopter up?

1213
01:25:41.96 --> 01:25:43.96
Wow.

1214
01:25:43.96 --> 01:25:47.96
That's a disconnected person, a very disconnected leader.

1215
01:25:47.96 --> 01:25:50.96
Unbelievable.

1216
01:25:50.96 --> 01:25:53.96
So that's just completely crazy.

1217
01:25:53.96 --> 01:25:55.96
Did you get wounded during that mission?

1218
01:25:55.96 --> 01:25:58.96
No, just banged up a little bit.

1219
01:25:58.96 --> 01:26:00.96
Just banged up a little bit.

1220
01:26:00.96 --> 01:26:04.96
I mean, it wasn't uncommon to get hit with something.

1221
01:26:04.96 --> 01:26:09.96
But I got the broken ribs and burned hands and all of that.

1222
01:26:09.96 --> 01:26:12.96
You know, with the first part of it.

1223
01:26:12.96 --> 01:26:14.96
But you know, the second part.

1224
01:26:14.96 --> 01:26:18.96
I just got skin up and stuff.

1225
01:26:18.96 --> 01:26:20.96
So then.

1226
01:26:20.96 --> 01:26:22.96
So now what's the next.

1227
01:26:22.96 --> 01:26:23.96
Let's see.

1228
01:26:23.96 --> 01:26:27.96
That was in two to seven May.

1229
01:26:27.96 --> 01:26:31.96
And then the next thing we got is a king be down.

1230
01:26:31.96 --> 01:26:35.96
So what if it can be helicopter's goes down?

1231
01:26:35.96 --> 01:26:39.96
That wasn't a good day.

1232
01:26:39.96 --> 01:26:43.96
So I'm, you know, I take RT, Virginia.

1233
01:26:43.96 --> 01:26:47.96
And we go on a mission.

1234
01:26:47.96 --> 01:26:57.96
And I think that's the one where it was the NVA division or regimen.

1235
01:26:57.96 --> 01:27:05.96
And we were supposed to go find them.

1236
01:27:05.96 --> 01:27:11.96
And then bring air strikes and things on.

1237
01:27:11.96 --> 01:27:13.96
Try to stop them.

1238
01:27:13.96 --> 01:27:22.96
Because hamburger Hill was a very political battle that happened.

1239
01:27:22.96 --> 01:27:26.96
The hundred and first was trying to fight their way up to the top of this mountain.

1240
01:27:26.96 --> 01:27:30.96
And taking all kinds of casualties.

1241
01:27:30.96 --> 01:27:33.96
And everybody was questioning at the time.

1242
01:27:33.96 --> 01:27:35.96
Why do they need to go up there?

1243
01:27:35.96 --> 01:27:37.96
Why does it go to take the high ground?

1244
01:27:37.96 --> 01:27:42.96
It'll be a political victory that as well as military as we if we take it.

1245
01:27:42.96 --> 01:27:46.96
They were taking all kind of casualties.

1246
01:27:46.96 --> 01:27:50.96
The North Vietnamese had this large unit that was coming.

1247
01:27:50.96 --> 01:27:53.96
And that was going to crush that battalion.

1248
01:27:53.96 --> 01:27:57.96
And you know, so our mission was to go out and find it.

1249
01:27:57.96 --> 01:27:59.96
Stop it. Don't let them get there.

1250
01:27:59.96 --> 01:28:02.96
They had moved a lot further along.

1251
01:28:02.96 --> 01:28:03.96
Then we thought.

1252
01:28:03.96 --> 01:28:07.96
So we do our little circle around thing.

1253
01:28:07.96 --> 01:28:11.96
And as we're coming in on short final, they open fire.

1254
01:28:11.96 --> 01:28:13.96
Hit the aircraft.

1255
01:28:13.96 --> 01:28:14.96
We lost power.

1256
01:28:14.96 --> 01:28:17.96
And you know, I'm setting in the door.

1257
01:28:17.96 --> 01:28:20.96
And I'm watching the ground come up and thinking, you know,

1258
01:28:20.96 --> 01:28:23.96
this is not good.

1259
01:28:23.96 --> 01:28:27.96
Man, we're going to really smack in and we did.

1260
01:28:27.96 --> 01:28:29.96
So hit the ground.

1261
01:28:29.96 --> 01:28:31.96
Everything went black.

1262
01:28:31.96 --> 01:28:36.96
And you know, then I, my eyes come open and I'm laying there thinking.

1263
01:28:36.96 --> 01:28:39.96
I'm out of lava, dude.

1264
01:28:39.96 --> 01:28:41.96
And then I hear the bullets crack at behind.

1265
01:28:41.96 --> 01:28:44.96
I'm thinking, I must be alive.

1266
01:28:44.96 --> 01:28:46.96
Somebody's trying to shoot me.

1267
01:28:46.96 --> 01:28:49.96
So I look around and see what's going on.

1268
01:28:49.96 --> 01:28:57.96
I get my guys who are scattered out on the ground to drag them over into a bomb crater that's there.

1269
01:28:57.96 --> 01:28:59.96
So we had some protection.

1270
01:28:59.96 --> 01:29:02.96
They eventually got the helicopter flying again.

1271
01:29:02.96 --> 01:29:03.96
Oh, wow.

1272
01:29:03.96 --> 01:29:06.96
We've been taking a lot of hits, but he got it back in here somehow.

1273
01:29:06.96 --> 01:29:08.96
Was your, the King B pilots?

1274
01:29:08.96 --> 01:29:10.96
These were South Vietnamese pilots.

1275
01:29:10.96 --> 01:29:13.96
South Vietnamese, but yeah, they flew for us.

1276
01:29:13.96 --> 01:29:15.96
There, there are guys.

1277
01:29:15.96 --> 01:29:16.96
Yeah.

1278
01:29:16.96 --> 01:29:17.96
So.

1279
01:29:17.96 --> 01:29:19.96
Yeah.

1280
01:29:19.96 --> 01:29:21.96
You know, we're, we're in the crater fighting.

1281
01:29:21.96 --> 01:29:23.96
They can't get back in to ground fires.

1282
01:29:23.96 --> 01:29:25.96
Way too heavy.

1283
01:29:25.96 --> 01:29:26.96
We're working there, strikes.

1284
01:29:26.96 --> 01:29:28.96
We're working them.

1285
01:29:28.96 --> 01:29:30.96
A1E's.

1286
01:29:30.96 --> 01:29:33.96
We're hitting the whole redsline.

1287
01:29:33.96 --> 01:29:35.96
We're hitting the top of the hill.

1288
01:29:35.96 --> 01:29:37.96
Getting second year explosions up there.

1289
01:29:37.96 --> 01:29:42.96
You know, because they already moved a lot of ammunition and stuff up on the hill.

1290
01:29:42.96 --> 01:29:45.96
So we're smoking it pretty hard.

1291
01:29:45.96 --> 01:29:49.96
But I mean, they can shoot right across the top of the bomb crater.

1292
01:29:49.96 --> 01:29:52.96
So it was kind of hard to stick you head out.

1293
01:29:52.96 --> 01:29:55.96
Everybody's busted up.

1294
01:29:55.96 --> 01:29:59.96
I'm experiencing, you know, a tremendous amount of pain.

1295
01:29:59.96 --> 01:30:02.96
And I'm not quite sure where's this coming from.

1296
01:30:02.96 --> 01:30:05.96
I mean, I'm hurting.

1297
01:30:05.96 --> 01:30:06.96
It's hard to breathe.

1298
01:30:06.96 --> 01:30:08.96
All that kind of stuff.

1299
01:30:08.96 --> 01:30:11.96
But, you know, we're getting a lot of kills.

1300
01:30:11.96 --> 01:30:14.96
They're trying to crawl out there to us.

1301
01:30:14.96 --> 01:30:19.96
And then eventually we suppressed the fire enough.

1302
01:30:19.96 --> 01:30:28.96
That one helicopters able to come in and took everybody on the team except for myself and one guy.

1303
01:30:28.96 --> 01:30:31.96
So two of us stayed there in the bomb.

1304
01:30:31.96 --> 01:30:34.96
That was that because the crowd of the too many people.

1305
01:30:34.96 --> 01:30:37.96
Is that because there are tactical reason to do that?

1306
01:30:37.96 --> 01:30:40.96
In this case, I wanted somebody else with me.

1307
01:30:40.96 --> 01:30:44.96
And then we were loading the aircraft down.

1308
01:30:44.96 --> 01:30:46.96
We were really putting too much weight on it.

1309
01:30:46.96 --> 01:30:53.96
So you, the fear was if you, if you, but if everyone got on that, the king be a wouldn't be able to take off.

1310
01:30:53.96 --> 01:30:54.96
Right.

1311
01:30:54.96 --> 01:30:55.96
It would go down.

1312
01:30:55.96 --> 01:30:57.96
So two of you are going to stay.

1313
01:30:57.96 --> 01:30:58.96
Yeah.

1314
01:30:58.96 --> 01:31:01.96
So, you know, it's a question kind of like we talked about before.

1315
01:31:01.96 --> 01:31:05.96
Sometimes you have to, the way to the good of the many,

1316
01:31:05.96 --> 01:31:10.96
you know, for us, the best solution was for us not to get on the helicopter.

1317
01:31:10.96 --> 01:31:12.96
We would stay there if we got out, we got out.

1318
01:31:12.96 --> 01:31:16.96
We didn't, we didn't, but the rest of the team, you know, would survive.

1319
01:31:16.96 --> 01:31:24.96
So, um, so they went away, was still, you know, doing a lot of shooting, working gunshots and stuff.

1320
01:31:24.96 --> 01:31:28.96
And then I just got a little irritated.

1321
01:31:28.96 --> 01:31:31.96
And I thought, I need to go get one of them.

1322
01:31:31.96 --> 01:31:34.96
I think what I'm going to do is just crawl out there because they're,

1323
01:31:34.96 --> 01:31:36.96
I know they're crawling around that.

1324
01:31:36.96 --> 01:31:37.96
They're in the grass.

1325
01:31:37.96 --> 01:31:40.96
I'm going to crawl out there and get one of these dovers.

1326
01:31:40.96 --> 01:31:44.96
Meaning, I mean, you're going to go and capture a live.

1327
01:31:44.96 --> 01:31:45.96
Yeah.

1328
01:31:45.96 --> 01:31:46.96
And it'll be.

1329
01:31:46.96 --> 01:31:48.96
So, you know, I told you, because, because you're right.

1330
01:31:48.96 --> 01:31:52.96
You know, you got two people, two of you, you're injured somehow.

1331
01:31:52.96 --> 01:31:53.96
You don't really know what it is.

1332
01:31:53.96 --> 01:31:54.96
You're in a bomb crater.

1333
01:31:54.96 --> 01:31:56.96
You're surrounded by an NVA division.

1334
01:31:56.96 --> 01:32:00.96
And you think, now's a good time to go and capture.

1335
01:32:00.96 --> 01:32:01.96
So what?

1336
01:32:01.96 --> 01:32:03.96
If I'm going to get somebody, I mean, this might be my last chance.

1337
01:32:03.96 --> 01:32:07.96
So I want to connect one of those dokers up because if we can

1338
01:32:07.96 --> 01:32:11.96
take him back, I mean, he give a lot of intel about where they are,

1339
01:32:11.96 --> 01:32:13.96
what they're doing, and everything.

1340
01:32:13.96 --> 01:32:16.96
So I start crawling out there in the grass.

1341
01:32:16.96 --> 01:32:18.96
Yeah, and the grass is about that.

1342
01:32:18.96 --> 01:32:21.96
But two and a half, three feet high.

1343
01:32:21.96 --> 01:32:23.96
And I'm crawling around out there and I can hear them.

1344
01:32:23.96 --> 01:32:26.96
You know, because they're shooting, they're still shooting at the,

1345
01:32:26.96 --> 01:32:27.96
the bomb crater.

1346
01:32:27.96 --> 01:32:30.96
They haven't realized that I've crawled out there with them.

1347
01:32:30.96 --> 01:32:33.96
And I can hear there's one up in front of me.

1348
01:32:33.96 --> 01:32:37.96
And I'm crawling up there and I said, y'all,

1349
01:32:37.96 --> 01:32:42.96
if I can get the timing right so that he doesn't see me,

1350
01:32:42.96 --> 01:32:45.96
you know, immediately, then, you know,

1351
01:32:45.96 --> 01:32:51.96
I can probably wound him, dragging back in, and you know, he'll be ours.

1352
01:32:51.96 --> 01:32:56.96
It just didn't go well when we had the encounter.

1353
01:32:56.96 --> 01:32:59.96
So I more than wounded him.

1354
01:32:59.96 --> 01:33:03.96
And, you know, so I didn't have a prisoner.

1355
01:33:03.96 --> 01:33:05.96
Did you shoot at him or did you stab him?

1356
01:33:05.96 --> 01:33:07.96
Yeah, I shot him.

1357
01:33:07.96 --> 01:33:10.96
Yeah, I mean, there are times to use the knife,

1358
01:33:10.96 --> 01:33:13.96
but sometimes you need to do it quick.

1359
01:33:13.96 --> 01:33:16.96
And, you know, if he's got buddies, you know,

1360
01:33:16.96 --> 01:33:18.96
you can only reach so far with a knife,

1361
01:33:18.96 --> 01:33:22.96
but with that car 15, you reach way out there and tap somebody.

1362
01:33:22.96 --> 01:33:23.96
Yeah.

1363
01:33:23.96 --> 01:33:28.96
So I decided to go back in because I didn't have any strength.

1364
01:33:28.96 --> 01:33:30.96
And I wasn't sure what was going on.

1365
01:33:30.96 --> 01:33:31.96
So I got back in.

1366
01:33:31.96 --> 01:33:33.96
Eventually, you suppressed the fire enough

1367
01:33:33.96 --> 01:33:37.96
that they were able to come back in and get to two of us.

1368
01:33:37.96 --> 01:33:41.96
And went back to the launch site and they said,

1369
01:33:41.96 --> 01:33:47.96
you know, that was good, but there's still a ton of them out there

1370
01:33:47.96 --> 01:33:50.96
and I need you to go back in tomorrow morning.

1371
01:33:50.96 --> 01:33:52.96
So take the team back.

1372
01:33:52.96 --> 01:33:56.96
You know, so I replaced some team members.

1373
01:33:56.96 --> 01:33:59.96
And why did you replace team members?

1374
01:33:59.96 --> 01:34:00.96
Because some of them were injured.

1375
01:34:00.96 --> 01:34:01.96
Yeah.

1376
01:34:01.96 --> 01:34:03.96
They were like, I got to cramst in.

1377
01:34:03.96 --> 01:34:07.96
And what about you, your back, and whatever.

1378
01:34:07.96 --> 01:34:08.96
I got with them.

1379
01:34:08.96 --> 01:34:12.96
I got with the medics and they drugged me up.

1380
01:34:12.96 --> 01:34:15.96
And they said, you know, with an impact that hard,

1381
01:34:15.96 --> 01:34:18.96
you know, you're bound to have some, you know,

1382
01:34:18.96 --> 01:34:21.96
some bruises and whatever.

1383
01:34:21.96 --> 01:34:22.96
And that's it, man.

1384
01:34:22.96 --> 01:34:23.96
This is not a bruise.

1385
01:34:23.96 --> 01:34:26.96
I mean, it's hard to breathe when I move.

1386
01:34:26.96 --> 01:34:31.96
But, you know, I, they said, we really need you to back out here tomorrow morning.

1387
01:34:31.96 --> 01:34:33.96
I mean, this is critical.

1388
01:34:33.96 --> 01:34:34.96
Okay.

1389
01:34:34.96 --> 01:34:35.96
We go to it.

1390
01:34:35.96 --> 01:34:38.96
So we go back in the same same insertion point.

1391
01:34:38.96 --> 01:34:39.96
No.

1392
01:34:39.96 --> 01:34:41.96
We moved over to different location.

1393
01:34:41.96 --> 01:34:44.96
You know, a few clicks away from that first one.

1394
01:34:44.96 --> 01:34:46.96
And went in.

1395
01:34:46.96 --> 01:34:49.96
And right after we got on the ground,

1396
01:34:49.96 --> 01:34:53.96
we went in into the jungle. We made contact.

1397
01:34:53.96 --> 01:34:57.96
So all of a sudden we were in heavy contact there.

1398
01:34:57.96 --> 01:35:03.96
And trying to suppress that fire, working against ships and things that we had with us.

1399
01:35:03.96 --> 01:35:07.96
Got it suppressed enough that we were able to get.

1400
01:35:07.96 --> 01:35:14.96
Again, all but me and one of the guys out on strings and lifted them out.

1401
01:35:14.96 --> 01:35:16.96
So the two of us were still there.

1402
01:35:16.96 --> 01:35:18.96
Still working there strikes.

1403
01:35:18.96 --> 01:35:24.96
And we were in a better position at this point to really hit the main body of the force.

1404
01:35:24.96 --> 01:35:27.96
And, you know, we had that big stick with us.

1405
01:35:27.96 --> 01:35:29.96
And we were hammering those.

1406
01:35:29.96 --> 01:35:33.96
I mean, literally thousands of were killed, you know, that morning.

1407
01:35:33.96 --> 01:35:37.96
I mean, we pretty much decimated, you know, that force.

1408
01:35:37.96 --> 01:35:41.96
David, what was your, what was your, were you in an elevated position?

1409
01:35:41.96 --> 01:35:42.96
Yeah.

1410
01:35:42.96 --> 01:35:45.96
Yeah. So we were up pretty close to the top of a mountain.

1411
01:35:45.96 --> 01:35:50.96
And we could see him in the valley. We could see him on the ridge line coming up to where we were.

1412
01:35:50.96 --> 01:35:52.96
We could see him on the ridge line where we did it.

1413
01:35:52.96 --> 01:35:54.96
Did they know where you were?

1414
01:35:54.96 --> 01:35:58.96
Yeah. I mean, from the fire that was going on, they knew we were up there.

1415
01:35:58.96 --> 01:36:00.96
But they couldn't get up there too.

1416
01:36:00.96 --> 01:36:02.96
As it's up for the ones that were already there.

1417
01:36:02.96 --> 01:36:06.96
Because, you know, now we had a big enough air support team.

1418
01:36:06.96 --> 01:36:08.96
We'll just out there to just smoke on.

1419
01:36:08.96 --> 01:36:09.96
We had the spads.

1420
01:36:09.96 --> 01:36:11.96
I mean, you know, the A1Es.

1421
01:36:11.96 --> 01:36:13.96
We had the L4s and gunships.

1422
01:36:13.96 --> 01:36:16.96
And I just rotating those things in.

1423
01:36:16.96 --> 01:36:21.96
I mean, they were stacked out here, waiting on their turn to come in and go after him.

1424
01:36:21.96 --> 01:36:24.96
Where we were, you know, I could see him.

1425
01:36:24.96 --> 01:36:28.96
And we had, you know, pretty significant contact right there.

1426
01:36:28.96 --> 01:36:31.96
And where we were directly on us.

1427
01:36:31.96 --> 01:36:39.96
And for some reason, it just seemed like a good idea to take one of them back with us.

1428
01:36:39.96 --> 01:36:42.96
Oh, so you got the notion again that you're going to try and capture.

1429
01:36:42.96 --> 01:36:45.96
So I thought, you know, it's a different terrain.

1430
01:36:45.96 --> 01:36:48.96
I need to get one of them.

1431
01:36:48.96 --> 01:36:56.96
So I, I crawled out here, you know, would cover in fire from a little guy.

1432
01:36:56.96 --> 01:37:02.96
In counter to guy and you know, I didn't have the strength to manhandle.

1433
01:37:02.96 --> 01:37:03.96
I wounded him.

1434
01:37:03.96 --> 01:37:05.96
But I was hurting so bad.

1435
01:37:05.96 --> 01:37:08.96
I, I just didn't have the strength.

1436
01:37:08.96 --> 01:37:11.96
I mean, I, on their normal conditions, I could have brought him back.

1437
01:37:11.96 --> 01:37:13.96
But I was in too much pain.

1438
01:37:13.96 --> 01:37:22.96
So, you know, I had to, you know, let him go to happy hunting ground wherever, you know,

1439
01:37:22.96 --> 01:37:29.96
and crawl back and later on that day, my self and the other guy were able to come out on strings

1440
01:37:29.96 --> 01:37:32.96
and then they really hammered a place there.

1441
01:37:32.96 --> 01:37:34.96
How long were you on the ground for on that one?

1442
01:37:34.96 --> 01:37:36.96
Most of the day.

1443
01:37:36.96 --> 01:37:42.96
So it was a long time.

1444
01:37:42.96 --> 01:37:46.96
And, you know, when we got back, they said, you know, I think there's something wrong with you.

1445
01:37:46.96 --> 01:37:47.96
I said, yeah, I think so.

1446
01:37:47.96 --> 01:37:55.96
By the way, the NVA, that, that element of NVA of thousands and thousands of NVA did they ever make to hamburger Hill.

1447
01:37:55.96 --> 01:38:01.96
So, so that's why, that's why the hundred first was not wiped out.

1448
01:38:01.96 --> 01:38:04.96
They did finally make it to the top.

1449
01:38:04.96 --> 01:38:11.96
And once they got out there and said, you know, where the king of the Hill, they were told, okay, come on back down.

1450
01:38:11.96 --> 01:38:17.96
When that kind of stuff was going on, what did you guys, was that, you know, we look back armchair,

1451
01:38:17.96 --> 01:38:22.96
quarter back and say, oh, you know, what were they thinking, what were you guys thinking?

1452
01:38:22.96 --> 01:38:27.96
When you guys hear that, hear what hear about that, would you think, what the hell is the leadership doing?

1453
01:38:27.96 --> 01:38:28.96
What are we doing?

1454
01:38:28.96 --> 01:38:35.96
I mean, why would you do that? Why would you sacrifice that many lives? And I, I've forgotten now, they're exact number,

1455
01:38:35.96 --> 01:38:41.96
but it was a lot of American's kill trying to get to top of that hill just to turn around and walk back down.

1456
01:38:41.96 --> 01:38:44.96
And I know it wasn't just that.

1457
01:38:44.96 --> 01:38:55.96
It was a big political move and everything, but it's just my opinion that I don't think it was worth losing people like that.

1458
01:38:55.96 --> 01:38:57.96
If you're going to turn around and go back down.

1459
01:38:57.96 --> 01:39:03.96
Now did you guys think about that? Did you talk about that? Did you guys look at each other and say, what the hell are we doing?

1460
01:39:03.96 --> 01:39:04.96
What, why would we make this?

1461
01:39:04.96 --> 01:39:11.96
Sometimes sometimes when we would get back, you know, the team member setting, you know, the American member setting around,

1462
01:39:11.96 --> 01:39:16.96
sometimes we would say, man, did you see what, here what happened?

1463
01:39:16.96 --> 01:39:20.96
And questioning, you know, some of the political things that we're going on.

1464
01:39:20.96 --> 01:39:28.96
Because now it's 1969. So this is like the height of the American anti-war movement right now.

1465
01:39:28.96 --> 01:39:31.96
This is like Woodstock's coming and all that stuff.

1466
01:39:31.96 --> 01:39:34.96
Yeah. Are you guys hearing any of that?

1467
01:39:34.96 --> 01:39:39.96
We are hearing some about the protest, but, you know, we didn't get to see.

1468
01:39:39.96 --> 01:39:45.96
I mean, we didn't have TV's and stuff like that. We didn't see what was going on.

1469
01:39:45.96 --> 01:39:50.96
And if you got a hold of an army times, you might see something in there, but a lot of stuff was held back.

1470
01:39:50.96 --> 01:39:55.96
Because they, you know, didn't want us being exposed to it.

1471
01:39:55.96 --> 01:40:02.96
But you knew, and you had heard from them, the people who were coming in more recently, things that they had seen.

1472
01:40:02.96 --> 01:40:09.96
You knew that you were likely to be spit on and the airport on the street.

1473
01:40:09.96 --> 01:40:14.96
If you were in uniform, and it was, what are you thinking about that?

1474
01:40:14.96 --> 01:40:20.96
I mean, if, if, are you just, can you even fathom that?

1475
01:40:20.96 --> 01:40:25.96
Well, I wasn't happy about it.

1476
01:40:25.96 --> 01:40:33.96
And, well, there were a lot of hijackings of planes going on at that time too.

1477
01:40:33.96 --> 01:40:40.96
So, not by protesters, but by different people hijacking them, they're fly the different countries.

1478
01:40:40.96 --> 01:40:51.96
And, you know, one of my thoughts was this browning, high power, nine millimeter, that I took off of a NVA.

1479
01:40:51.96 --> 01:40:56.96
I'm carrying that women down to plane. My plane is not going to be hijacked.

1480
01:40:56.96 --> 01:41:02.96
It would be the hijackers worst nightmare to try to stop my plane.

1481
01:41:02.96 --> 01:41:07.96
So, I carried it with me.

1482
01:41:07.96 --> 01:41:12.96
And I had it when I went through the airport. I did get spit out. I got called baby killer.

1483
01:41:12.96 --> 01:41:17.96
You know, all kinds of things like that. You know, from various groups in the airport.

1484
01:41:17.96 --> 01:41:23.96
So, it was not the welcome home kind of thing that you see today.

1485
01:41:23.96 --> 01:41:27.96
Although, we don't, I don't think we do a very good job today.

1486
01:41:27.96 --> 01:41:30.96
We do a lot better than we did.

1487
01:41:30.96 --> 01:41:36.96
So, yeah, I wasn't happy about what was going on.

1488
01:41:36.96 --> 01:41:40.96
So, you were about to say before I cut you off, you were about to say that you get back.

1489
01:41:40.96 --> 01:41:45.96
And now, you're saying, hey, there's something, actually, I think there's actually something wrong with me.

1490
01:41:45.96 --> 01:41:55.96
Yeah, they decided that they decided at the time that I had severely bruised my back and maybe some vertebrae.

1491
01:41:55.96 --> 01:41:58.96
And I think I'll broke another couple of ribs.

1492
01:41:58.96 --> 01:42:01.96
I don't remember right now, but I think there's a couple of ribs broken to you.

1493
01:42:01.96 --> 01:42:09.96
And, you know, beat up, cut up, and it was determined later that I had fractured my spine and a couple of vertebrae.

1494
01:42:09.96 --> 01:42:19.96
And they just couldn't believe that I actually went on a mission like that and was able to do, you know, what we did.

1495
01:42:19.96 --> 01:42:23.96
But it's, it's what they give you a couple days down time and some moturing.

1496
01:42:23.96 --> 01:42:28.96
Oh, they promised that. And then they said, no, yeah, I got a few days down time after that.

1497
01:42:28.96 --> 01:42:33.96
But yeah, it, a moturing like it was candy.

1498
01:42:33.96 --> 01:42:41.96
And then it was, okay, you got eventually, you know, but a time the next mission came around.

1499
01:42:41.96 --> 01:42:43.96
Yeah, right, it'd be good.

1500
01:42:43.96 --> 01:42:50.96
And it was, you have a note in here about the POW mission.

1501
01:42:50.96 --> 01:42:53.96
Is that, is that after you got home?

1502
01:42:53.96 --> 01:42:56.96
No, this is still, I'm still over there.

1503
01:42:56.96 --> 01:43:06.96
Okay. So we got intel, excuse me, got intel all of a sudden that said there was a small group.

1504
01:43:06.96 --> 01:43:11.96
And 10 to 15 American POWs that were being moved north.

1505
01:43:11.96 --> 01:43:15.96
And the intel said, we know where they are.

1506
01:43:15.96 --> 01:43:19.96
So they said, we need to get them.

1507
01:43:19.96 --> 01:43:27.96
So that became the mission, but it was going to be intense combat kind of mission.

1508
01:43:27.96 --> 01:43:31.96
So what we did was we created a spike team.

1509
01:43:31.96 --> 01:43:36.96
So buddy of mine, Bruce Longward and I would do that sometimes.

1510
01:43:36.96 --> 01:43:38.96
We would put our two teams together.

1511
01:43:38.96 --> 01:43:42.96
So we'd have about 20 or so people to take out there.

1512
01:43:42.96 --> 01:43:44.96
We took a medic with a system.

1513
01:43:44.96 --> 01:43:51.96
We were loaded for beer, two machine guns, all of that, you know, extra ammo, everything.

1514
01:43:51.96 --> 01:43:55.96
And our mission was to go out and find them and get them back.

1515
01:43:55.96 --> 01:44:00.96
So we went to the launch site with, we were supposed to launch.

1516
01:44:00.96 --> 01:44:10.96
And the next day there was a hatchet force that was there too that had a mission to go,

1517
01:44:10.96 --> 01:44:13.96
I don't know what their mission was, but they were going somewhere.

1518
01:44:13.96 --> 01:44:23.96
And we had a team, a dentist nail, and Michael Brown's team was on the ground.

1519
01:44:23.96 --> 01:44:29.96
They had finished their mission, they moved back to an extraction, LZ.

1520
01:44:29.96 --> 01:44:31.96
They had call for extraction.

1521
01:44:31.96 --> 01:44:35.96
And then all of a sudden they called it a prayer fire emergency.

1522
01:44:35.96 --> 01:44:46.96
They were being overrun and then a lost contact with the radio contact with a team.

1523
01:44:46.96 --> 01:44:56.96
One of the aircraft, because one of the aircraft out in the area heard a transmission on the little URT radio.

1524
01:44:56.96 --> 01:45:00.96
They just operated on to guard frequency.

1525
01:45:00.96 --> 01:45:06.96
They picked up what they thought was an American voice saying, somebody helped me, help me,

1526
01:45:06.96 --> 01:45:08.96
for God's sake, somebody helped me.

1527
01:45:08.96 --> 01:45:13.96
They heard that voice and that was all we heard.

1528
01:45:13.96 --> 01:45:20.96
And so everything, everything, the launch site stopped because now it's a prayer fire.

1529
01:45:20.96 --> 01:45:26.96
And we got to go get dentist's team.

1530
01:45:26.96 --> 01:45:36.96
And that was a situation where I didn't have a 2 day R in our coming out, but I'm looking at the aircraft that's about to go out to try to bring them back.

1531
01:45:36.96 --> 01:45:42.96
And I'm thinking, I probably should get on that aircraft.

1532
01:45:42.96 --> 01:45:44.96
I think I should go with them.

1533
01:45:44.96 --> 01:45:52.96
And then I think, I've got to lead my own mission to get POW's, a couple hours.

1534
01:45:52.96 --> 01:45:57.96
I've got to go do that. I can't jump on this aircraft and fly out there.

1535
01:45:57.96 --> 01:45:59.96
I mean, that's not going to work.

1536
01:45:59.96 --> 01:46:06.96
So I didn't go. They went out into the area.

1537
01:46:06.96 --> 01:46:10.96
They saw some movement. They saw what they thought were good guys.

1538
01:46:10.96 --> 01:46:13.96
They dropped the McGuire reach down.

1539
01:46:13.96 --> 01:46:17.96
And as they were lifting off, three of them pulled tight.

1540
01:46:17.96 --> 01:46:27.96
And then one of them shot loose and they came on up. They had two indigenous personnel on them agrieregs.

1541
01:46:27.96 --> 01:46:35.96
And the crew chief said he thought he saw an American on that third one that POW lose.

1542
01:46:35.96 --> 01:46:42.96
That he thought an American had gotten in there and fell out as they were pulling attention up.

1543
01:46:42.96 --> 01:46:44.96
But they were receiving so much fire.

1544
01:46:44.96 --> 01:46:51.96
They couldn't go back in there. So they brought the two survivors from the team back to the launch site.

1545
01:46:51.96 --> 01:46:55.96
They did a quick debriefing from them.

1546
01:46:55.96 --> 01:46:58.96
They said everybody else who was dead.

1547
01:46:58.96 --> 01:47:04.96
They launched the hatchet force to go in as a bright light team.

1548
01:47:04.96 --> 01:47:11.96
They changed their mission to bright light and decided to put them out there because there were so many bad guys in the area.

1549
01:47:11.96 --> 01:47:19.96
But they inserted them a couple thousand meters away from where the inspection site was.

1550
01:47:19.96 --> 01:47:23.96
They were pinned down on the LZ. Never moved anywhere.

1551
01:47:23.96 --> 01:47:27.96
They just got into the tree line and that was as far as they could go.

1552
01:47:27.96 --> 01:47:31.96
So once that started happening and they saw they couldn't go anywhere.

1553
01:47:31.96 --> 01:47:35.96
Then they came to me and said, you know, your mission changed.

1554
01:47:35.96 --> 01:47:38.96
You were now the bright light team.

1555
01:47:38.96 --> 01:47:43.96
So I got all my guys together and said, okay, we're going bright light.

1556
01:47:43.96 --> 01:47:46.96
The other mission we'll do later.

1557
01:47:46.96 --> 01:47:52.96
So then, you know, we planned to mission right quick and they inserted us.

1558
01:47:52.96 --> 01:47:55.96
The whole spike team.

1559
01:47:55.96 --> 01:47:58.96
So I mean, that's five aircraft going in.

1560
01:47:58.96 --> 01:48:02.96
And he said, you know, it's a really hot area.

1561
01:48:02.96 --> 01:48:07.96
So we're going to prep the LZ but we have to be careful because we don't know where to go.

1562
01:48:07.96 --> 01:48:10.96
And no, where the other team members are that might be out there.

1563
01:48:10.96 --> 01:48:13.96
So we can't just hammer the whole area.

1564
01:48:13.96 --> 01:48:16.96
We can only prep it right around the LZ.

1565
01:48:16.96 --> 01:48:20.96
So they went out, you know, the gunshots they had of us.

1566
01:48:20.96 --> 01:48:22.96
They prep the LZ.

1567
01:48:22.96 --> 01:48:27.96
And, you know, I'm listening to the headset and it's not sounded good.

1568
01:48:27.96 --> 01:48:32.96
And, you know, I knew we were going to get hammered because they were going to open up on us.

1569
01:48:32.96 --> 01:48:34.96
It says we got close.

1570
01:48:34.96 --> 01:48:40.96
And I was in the lead chip and as we started then, you know, bullets are coming everywhere.

1571
01:48:40.96 --> 01:48:42.96
They are craft's taking hits.

1572
01:48:42.96 --> 01:48:44.96
The ones behind me are taking hits.

1573
01:48:44.96 --> 01:48:53.96
But we went on in, got on the ground, got my first load in the tree line, brought in the rest of the guys.

1574
01:48:53.96 --> 01:48:57.96
One chip at the time, working hair strikes, you know, right around us.

1575
01:48:57.96 --> 01:48:59.96
It's pressed the fires, much as you're good.

1576
01:48:59.96 --> 01:49:13.96
So we spent until the next afternoon, mostly fighting, looking for Dennis' team, trying to find any survivors that we could.

1577
01:49:13.96 --> 01:49:21.96
So it was a long night and they were firing mortars over at the hatchet force.

1578
01:49:21.96 --> 01:49:24.96
We could hear them from back up behind us.

1579
01:49:24.96 --> 01:49:28.96
I mean, I would call them and say, you know, rounds on the way.

1580
01:49:28.96 --> 01:49:32.96
Outside of here, I'm dropping into to you and douche, you know, and I just tell them.

1581
01:49:32.96 --> 01:49:35.96
You got in coming and get everybody down.

1582
01:49:35.96 --> 01:49:42.96
But we couldn't get to where the mortars were because there were too many people around us.

1583
01:49:42.96 --> 01:49:47.96
When you got daylight, we were still looking for more looking for Dennis Moore.

1584
01:49:47.96 --> 01:49:50.96
We were in the middle of a bunker complex.

1585
01:49:50.96 --> 01:49:57.96
We were all around us. And that's why one reason that the LZPRout didn't have much of the effects.

1586
01:49:57.96 --> 01:49:59.96
They were in their bunkers.

1587
01:49:59.96 --> 01:50:02.96
So anyway, we brought in a lot of air support.

1588
01:50:02.96 --> 01:50:04.96
I've been so he got out.

1589
01:50:04.96 --> 01:50:08.96
Dennis' team was never found.

1590
01:50:08.96 --> 01:50:19.96
And the two survivors, there's no doubt in my mind that they gave us the wrong location.

1591
01:50:19.96 --> 01:50:23.96
Where the team was when it was overrun.

1592
01:50:23.96 --> 01:50:27.96
I don't think they did it intentionally.

1593
01:50:27.96 --> 01:50:29.96
I think it was the stress.

1594
01:50:29.96 --> 01:50:33.96
I think it was being chased trying to survive.

1595
01:50:33.96 --> 01:50:38.96
I think they lost track would have for them to get to where they were picked up from.

1596
01:50:38.96 --> 01:50:40.96
Because otherwise you would have failed something.

1597
01:50:40.96 --> 01:50:42.96
We would have found something.

1598
01:50:42.96 --> 01:50:49.96
But you can go out there and you can find people who've written all kinds of things about Dennis' mission.

1599
01:50:49.96 --> 01:50:53.96
And that nothing, you know, never that's what's found and things like that.

1600
01:50:53.96 --> 01:50:54.96
I was there.

1601
01:50:54.96 --> 01:50:56.96
I was the guy on the ground.

1602
01:50:56.96 --> 01:50:58.96
You know, I searched that area.

1603
01:50:58.96 --> 01:51:03.96
I know what was there.

1604
01:51:03.96 --> 01:51:07.96
And Dennis was my roommate.

1605
01:51:07.96 --> 01:51:11.96
So we were already very close.

1606
01:51:11.96 --> 01:51:18.96
And so I had a personal stake and finding his team.

1607
01:51:18.96 --> 01:51:21.96
And we just didn't make it.

1608
01:51:21.96 --> 01:51:24.96
So we came back.

1609
01:51:24.96 --> 01:51:26.96
So I was our mission for the PW.

1610
01:51:26.96 --> 01:51:29.96
So it was postponed.

1611
01:51:29.96 --> 01:51:31.96
And we went back down.

1612
01:51:31.96 --> 01:51:33.96
It started replanting that mission again.

1613
01:51:33.96 --> 01:51:37.96
But you know, because according to the intel they had moved more.

1614
01:51:37.96 --> 01:51:44.96
So we had to pick a new site to go into and kind of think through it a little differently.

1615
01:51:44.96 --> 01:51:55.96
And it turned out to be one of the most interesting missions that I had.

1616
01:51:55.96 --> 01:52:04.96
Maybe one of the most unique and and sob because of a couple of things that happened.

1617
01:52:04.96 --> 01:52:08.96
Well, like what?

1618
01:52:08.96 --> 01:52:19.96
You know, it's it's really interesting that if anyone listen to this podcast, we've we we I had on a one of the guys have had on the podcast was a guy named Colonel William Reader.

1619
01:52:19.96 --> 01:52:23.96
And he was a helicopter pilot that was shot down two times.

1620
01:52:23.96 --> 01:52:26.96
And the second time he was shot down, he was captured.

1621
01:52:26.96 --> 01:52:32.96
And he was one of those folks that was being moved from South Vietnam to the north,

1622
01:52:32.96 --> 01:52:35.96
which was actually the worst possible thing to have happening.

1623
01:52:35.96 --> 01:52:39.96
And guys died on those tracks and you know, this was this was them.

1624
01:52:39.96 --> 01:52:46.96
The the stereotypical image that you get of of the Vietnam prisoner of war.

1625
01:52:46.96 --> 01:52:48.96
In the jungle, that's what these guys were going through.

1626
01:52:48.96 --> 01:52:53.96
So the guys in the Hanoi Hilton that were at least they were identified.

1627
01:52:53.96 --> 01:52:55.96
People knew that they were there, etc.

1628
01:52:55.96 --> 01:52:57.96
These guys in the jungle.

1629
01:52:57.96 --> 01:53:01.96
They were just getting, you know, every horrible thing that could possibly happen.

1630
01:53:01.96 --> 01:53:05.96
And then the last thing that could happen was that they were going through the last thing that could happen to those guys.

1631
01:53:05.96 --> 01:53:09.96
So when you talk about the fact that you knew, you know, you had intel.

1632
01:53:09.96 --> 01:53:13.96
This is the type of person that I'm thinking that you're going to save, you know,

1633
01:53:13.96 --> 01:53:19.96
someone like Colonel William Reader who, you know, the stories that he told about being captured.

1634
01:53:19.96 --> 01:53:24.96
And you know, at one point he was in a two-foot tall bamboo cage.

1635
01:53:24.96 --> 01:53:26.96
His legs are shackled.

1636
01:53:26.96 --> 01:53:28.96
He's in the middle of the jungle.

1637
01:53:28.96 --> 01:53:34.96
He's trying to get some sleep, but he can't sleep because the rats are knowing at the wounds in his legs.

1638
01:53:34.96 --> 01:53:39.96
So that's the, when you say, hey, you got an opportunity to go capture these, these guys.

1639
01:53:39.96 --> 01:53:44.96
That's what I'm thinking about.

1640
01:53:44.96 --> 01:53:48.96
And you're doing all this just on top of, you know, losing your friend, your brother Dennis Neill,

1641
01:53:48.96 --> 01:53:57.96
who completely, you know, disappears.

1642
01:53:57.96 --> 01:54:02.96
So what changed about what changed about the mission when what, what, what did it start, what made it so unique?

1643
01:54:02.96 --> 01:54:08.96
Having, we were going into a different location, different route.

1644
01:54:08.96 --> 01:54:18.96
Other than that, the beginning was basically the way it was supposed to go when we got canceled before.

1645
01:54:18.96 --> 01:54:23.96
We go, we go in relatively un-eventful.

1646
01:54:23.96 --> 01:54:27.96
And we get on the ELZ, and it's the big team.

1647
01:54:27.96 --> 01:54:29.96
So Bruce and I have our teams together.

1648
01:54:29.96 --> 01:54:31.96
It's a big one.

1649
01:54:31.96 --> 01:54:35.96
And we start moving up the redsline.

1650
01:54:35.96 --> 01:54:39.96
It was kind of a late in-sersh and not last light, but kind of late.

1651
01:54:39.96 --> 01:54:41.96
We start up the redsline.

1652
01:54:41.96 --> 01:54:48.96
We get a few hundred meters up there and then we stop, you know, for the night.

1653
01:54:48.96 --> 01:54:50.96
You know, because you got a big group now, it takes longer.

1654
01:54:50.96 --> 01:54:54.96
You get everybody in position and get set up, get all the claymores out, get everything.

1655
01:54:54.96 --> 01:54:57.96
The way you, you know, way you need it.

1656
01:54:57.96 --> 01:55:01.96
So, and now we have a larger perimeter.

1657
01:55:01.96 --> 01:55:03.96
I am in the center of it.

1658
01:55:03.96 --> 01:55:08.96
Bruce is, you know, close to me, but I know where he is.

1659
01:55:08.96 --> 01:55:13.96
And what was, in a resting way, you know, it got dark.

1660
01:55:13.96 --> 01:55:16.96
And the weather was starting to get bad.

1661
01:55:16.96 --> 01:55:19.96
But it's dark.

1662
01:55:19.96 --> 01:55:24.96
And you can't see your hand in front of your face.

1663
01:55:24.96 --> 01:55:28.96
And I'm leaning against the tree.

1664
01:55:28.96 --> 01:55:30.96
My rooksack behind me.

1665
01:55:30.96 --> 01:55:33.96
I got my core 15 across my lap.

1666
01:55:33.96 --> 01:55:35.96
I'm like I normally do.

1667
01:55:35.96 --> 01:55:38.96
And I'm just about to sleep.

1668
01:55:38.96 --> 01:55:42.96
And I hear a twig break.

1669
01:55:42.96 --> 01:55:45.96
And my eyes open.

1670
01:55:45.96 --> 01:55:47.96
And I'm thinking, wow.

1671
01:55:47.96 --> 01:55:50.96
Did I just hear a twig break?

1672
01:55:50.96 --> 01:55:51.96
And then I hear another one.

1673
01:55:51.96 --> 01:55:59.96
And I'm saying to myself, that's directly in front of me.

1674
01:55:59.96 --> 01:56:03.96
There's somebody in front of me that's moving in this direction.

1675
01:56:03.96 --> 01:56:05.96
So now I'm listening.

1676
01:56:05.96 --> 01:56:11.96
And I'm saying, somebody is coming directly at me.

1677
01:56:11.96 --> 01:56:14.96
And I'm thinking, how did you get through the perimeter?

1678
01:56:14.96 --> 01:56:16.96
I mean, we're not spaced very far apart at all.

1679
01:56:16.96 --> 01:56:17.96
I know, we're all good.

1680
01:56:17.96 --> 01:56:20.96
This guy have walked through our perimeter.

1681
01:56:20.96 --> 01:56:22.96
And he's on the inside now.

1682
01:56:22.96 --> 01:56:23.96
And he's coming.

1683
01:56:23.96 --> 01:56:25.96
Straight at me.

1684
01:56:25.96 --> 01:56:28.96
And so I'm playing all those thoughts in my mind.

1685
01:56:28.96 --> 01:56:31.96
And he's getting closer.

1686
01:56:31.96 --> 01:56:34.96
And now I've got my adrenaline going.

1687
01:56:34.96 --> 01:56:37.96
I've got my super senses working.

1688
01:56:37.96 --> 01:56:41.96
And even though it's so dark, I can't see anything.

1689
01:56:41.96 --> 01:56:44.96
I can visualize him and find me.

1690
01:56:44.96 --> 01:56:50.96
I can literally see a black silhouette in my mind.

1691
01:56:50.96 --> 01:56:52.96
Because I'm tracking the sound.

1692
01:56:52.96 --> 01:56:53.96
I can hear him breathing.

1693
01:56:53.96 --> 01:56:55.96
And he's coming right at me.

1694
01:56:55.96 --> 01:56:59.96
And I'm thinking, this is not going to be good.

1695
01:56:59.96 --> 01:57:02.96
This guy is going to walk right into me.

1696
01:57:02.96 --> 01:57:05.96
So I've got to make a decision.

1697
01:57:05.96 --> 01:57:10.96
If I just shoot him right now, it's going to light me up.

1698
01:57:10.96 --> 01:57:15.96
Like a neon sign. And all these buddies are going to open up.

1699
01:57:15.96 --> 01:57:18.96
I've got to do something. Use about the step on me.

1700
01:57:18.96 --> 01:57:23.96
So I've got to select, switch on the full order.

1701
01:57:23.96 --> 01:57:25.96
I've got my weapon in the hand.

1702
01:57:25.96 --> 01:57:29.96
And I'm tracking mentally this silhouette.

1703
01:57:29.96 --> 01:57:35.96
And when it gets in my mind, where he's within reach,

1704
01:57:35.96 --> 01:57:41.96
my plan was I'm going to reach out and grab a hold of him.

1705
01:57:41.96 --> 01:57:45.96
I'm going to cram the barrel of the car 15 in his head.

1706
01:57:45.96 --> 01:57:48.96
And I'm going to pull him. He'll be off balance.

1707
01:57:48.96 --> 01:57:51.96
I'll pull him and bring him down to the ground.

1708
01:57:51.96 --> 01:57:57.96
If he fires his weapon, if he yells, if he makes any kind of sound,

1709
01:57:57.96 --> 01:58:01.96
I'm going to put a three or four round burst in his head.

1710
01:58:01.96 --> 01:58:05.96
And of course, I'll light me up and everybody starts shooting at me.

1711
01:58:05.96 --> 01:58:09.96
But I can't let him be in there.

1712
01:58:09.96 --> 01:58:14.96
So I got within and range. I reached up. I grabbed him.

1713
01:58:14.96 --> 01:58:17.96
It just the same instant to gun.

1714
01:58:17.96 --> 01:58:19.96
He didn't even decide to head. Cut it to be gashin.

1715
01:58:19.96 --> 01:58:22.96
His head. I pulled him down. He hasn't set a word.

1716
01:58:22.96 --> 01:58:24.96
I jerk him right down to the ground.

1717
01:58:24.96 --> 01:58:26.96
And the gun is there.

1718
01:58:26.96 --> 01:58:29.96
And I'm saying, now what am I going to do?

1719
01:58:29.96 --> 01:58:35.96
I mean, I've got him. But why am I going to do with him?

1720
01:58:35.96 --> 01:58:40.96
And all of a sudden, I hear him whisper.

1721
01:58:40.96 --> 01:58:42.96
Trump, we, Trump, we.

1722
01:58:42.96 --> 01:58:44.96
He's saying, look down. Look down.

1723
01:58:44.96 --> 01:58:46.96
Lights, lights.

1724
01:58:46.96 --> 01:58:49.96
And I'm thinking, what?

1725
01:58:49.96 --> 01:58:51.96
Lights, lights.

1726
01:58:51.96 --> 01:58:54.96
And I realized we had a Vietnamese captain with us.

1727
01:58:54.96 --> 01:58:59.96
Vietnamese Army captain.

1728
01:58:59.96 --> 01:59:02.96
And he had seen something. And he was coming to tell me.

1729
01:59:02.96 --> 01:59:04.96
You know, look at him.

1730
01:59:04.96 --> 01:59:07.96
He wasn't used to going out with us.

1731
01:59:07.96 --> 01:59:09.96
And he was coming to tell me.

1732
01:59:09.96 --> 01:59:12.96
I've got him down on the ground now with the guns.

1733
01:59:12.96 --> 01:59:14.96
I can't wait to do his head.

1734
01:59:14.96 --> 01:59:17.96
And he's saying lights and lights.

1735
01:59:17.96 --> 01:59:22.96
And I look up and I'm looking up the ridge up towards the top of the mountain.

1736
01:59:22.96 --> 01:59:26.96
And all the way from the top of the mountain, about halfway down the ridge,

1737
01:59:26.96 --> 01:59:28.96
are just lights.

1738
01:59:28.96 --> 01:59:34.96
I thought, you know, there might be flashlights, but I think there was some kind of a lantern.

1739
01:59:34.96 --> 01:59:38.96
And there was just a stream of people coming down the mountains.

1740
01:59:38.96 --> 01:59:41.96
You know, so I led him up.

1741
01:59:41.96 --> 01:59:43.96
I looked back down the ridge.

1742
01:59:43.96 --> 01:59:49.96
And there's a stream of lights as far as I can see down the ridge coming up.

1743
01:59:49.96 --> 01:59:54.96
The guy that's monitored in radio right then says,

1744
01:59:54.96 --> 01:59:58.96
Sir, you need to hear this.

1745
01:59:58.96 --> 02:00:00.96
The handsmith of handset.

1746
02:00:00.96 --> 02:00:01.96
And I respond.

1747
02:00:01.96 --> 02:00:06.96
And what I hear is, you are now a prayer-fire emergency.

1748
02:00:06.96 --> 02:00:17.96
This is coming from Saagheg, where down in Saigon, being a relay to tell us that we are prayer-fire emergency.

1749
02:00:17.96 --> 02:00:20.96
And I'm thinking, I didn't know that.

1750
02:00:20.96 --> 02:00:23.96
But I mean, you know, I'm looking now and seeing all these lights.

1751
02:00:23.96 --> 02:00:29.96
And I'm thinking, yeah, I think we probably are.

1752
02:00:29.96 --> 02:00:33.96
And we're carrying a KY38.

1753
02:00:33.96 --> 02:00:34.96
All right.

1754
02:00:34.96 --> 02:00:39.96
We have the most secure tactical radio that there is.

1755
02:00:39.96 --> 02:00:43.96
They kind of, you have to set that gun with about 20 manual settings.

1756
02:00:43.96 --> 02:00:47.96
And the punch in the crypto code.

1757
02:00:47.96 --> 02:00:49.96
You have to have all the frequencies.

1758
02:00:49.96 --> 02:00:52.96
You have to have all the settings.

1759
02:00:52.96 --> 02:00:56.96
And then the guy I'm honored and radio says,

1760
02:00:56.96 --> 02:00:58.96
It's our unique idea of this.

1761
02:00:58.96 --> 02:00:59.96
Nothing.

1762
02:00:59.96 --> 02:01:00.96
Now what?

1763
02:01:00.96 --> 02:01:02.96
These guys are coming from everywhere.

1764
02:01:02.96 --> 02:01:03.96
And he's got something else.

1765
02:01:03.96 --> 02:01:05.96
He wants me to listen to.

1766
02:01:05.96 --> 02:01:09.96
And I pick up the handset.

1767
02:01:09.96 --> 02:01:12.96
And I'm thinking, what do I hear?

1768
02:01:12.96 --> 02:01:14.96
It's music.

1769
02:01:14.96 --> 02:01:18.96
I'm hearing music coming over the handset.

1770
02:01:18.96 --> 02:01:24.96
And then I hear this female NVA, whatever.

1771
02:01:24.96 --> 02:01:26.96
Start talking.

1772
02:01:26.96 --> 02:01:29.96
And it dawns on me all of a sudden.

1773
02:01:29.96 --> 02:01:32.96
This is funeral music.

1774
02:01:32.96 --> 02:01:34.96
This is the obituary music.

1775
02:01:34.96 --> 02:01:38.96
This is the, what I used to hear when I was little.

1776
02:01:38.96 --> 02:01:43.96
On my grandmother's radio every day, you know, at lunch.

1777
02:01:43.96 --> 02:01:47.96
They do the news, but then they would do the obituaries for the people,

1778
02:01:47.96 --> 02:01:50.96
you know, in that county or whatever that had died.

1779
02:01:50.96 --> 02:01:52.96
They'd read off your name and all the stuff.

1780
02:01:52.96 --> 02:01:55.96
And they'd have this music in the background.

1781
02:01:55.96 --> 02:02:02.96
And this female is reading off our obituary.

1782
02:02:02.96 --> 02:02:07.96
That we were killed in action that day.

1783
02:02:07.96 --> 02:02:13.96
And she reads my name off as Dick Thompson.

1784
02:02:13.96 --> 02:02:23.96
And I'm thinking, there's only one person on this side of the world who knows me as Dick.

1785
02:02:23.96 --> 02:02:27.96
That has any clue that that's my name.

1786
02:02:27.96 --> 02:02:29.96
And that was barred well.

1787
02:02:29.96 --> 02:02:33.96
And you, you know, barred well was someplace.

1788
02:02:33.96 --> 02:02:35.96
Nobody had him.

1789
02:02:35.96 --> 02:02:42.96
And she reads my name off as Dick Thompson reads off the name of every member that we had on the team.

1790
02:02:42.96 --> 02:02:51.96
All of us as being killed in action that day on the secure encrypted radio.

1791
02:02:51.96 --> 02:02:57.96
So I got on's listening to this and thinking, what is going on?

1792
02:02:57.96 --> 02:02:59.96
And I'm thinking, what is going on?

1793
02:02:59.96 --> 02:03:02.96
This isn't making me, you know, a little nervous.

1794
02:03:02.96 --> 02:03:06.96
How did you know my name? I did they get on this frequency.

1795
02:03:06.96 --> 02:03:10.96
And, you know, and then that goes away.

1796
02:03:10.96 --> 02:03:14.96
So it's kind of got my attention now in the bad guys are coming.

1797
02:03:14.96 --> 02:03:20.96
So you start, you know, talking back and forth, you know, with,

1798
02:03:20.96 --> 02:03:23.96
they've got a cubby out in the area now.

1799
02:03:23.96 --> 02:03:28.96
So we start talking about, you know, what are options for getting us out of here?

1800
02:03:28.96 --> 02:03:30.96
Because the weather's not that good.

1801
02:03:30.96 --> 02:03:33.96
The weather's starting to roll in.

1802
02:03:33.96 --> 02:03:37.96
And you know, I've got a couple of friends of North Vietnamese all around us.

1803
02:03:37.96 --> 02:03:41.96
I've got this one woman who just told us all that we were killed a day.

1804
02:03:41.96 --> 02:03:44.96
I read our obituary.

1805
02:03:44.96 --> 02:03:47.96
I guess she'd get our names.

1806
02:03:47.96 --> 02:03:52.96
Though everyone is in shock and confused about, you know, what's going on?

1807
02:03:52.96 --> 02:03:56.96
How did they know exactly where we were in their coming at us?

1808
02:03:56.96 --> 02:04:00.96
The weather's starting to roll in.

1809
02:04:00.96 --> 02:04:04.96
And the clouds are slowly starting to come down on the mountains.

1810
02:04:04.96 --> 02:04:08.96
So now I'm thinking, I mean, we're not going to be able to get air support.

1811
02:04:08.96 --> 02:04:11.96
They can't get aircraft into extractus.

1812
02:04:11.96 --> 02:04:17.96
And I'm having this conversation now with Kaviy about, I need some options.

1813
02:04:17.96 --> 02:04:21.96
Because these, these guys are going to be here pretty soon.

1814
02:04:21.96 --> 02:04:23.96
And you know, it's not going to be pleasant.

1815
02:04:23.96 --> 02:04:28.96
We're loaded for bear, but not for that many people, not to be trapped in the dream.

1816
02:04:28.96 --> 02:04:34.96
So finally they said, you know, one option might be combat skyspots.

1817
02:04:34.96 --> 02:04:39.96
Although that's, elf-forces coming out with 500 pound bombs.

1818
02:04:39.96 --> 02:04:46.96
And you know, you give them a coordinate two or three thousand meters away from you.

1819
02:04:46.96 --> 02:04:52.96
They're flying by radar and being vectored by radar toward those coordinates.

1820
02:04:52.96 --> 02:04:57.96
And then when the radar says, you're at the right place to release the bomb.

1821
02:04:57.96 --> 02:05:00.96
You release, you know, a bomb.

1822
02:05:00.96 --> 02:05:02.96
And you see where it hits.

1823
02:05:02.96 --> 02:05:05.96
So this is because it's a nighttime scenario.

1824
02:05:05.96 --> 02:05:09.96
It's night. Well, it's night plus now the clouds are down on the mountain.

1825
02:05:09.96 --> 02:05:14.96
So he can, you can even see the mountain that we're on over the reason.

1826
02:05:14.96 --> 02:05:16.96
I mean, what was that?

1827
02:05:16.96 --> 02:05:20.96
He's called combat skyspot.

1828
02:05:20.96 --> 02:05:27.96
So that's a technique that's not used very often because it's not very accurate.

1829
02:05:27.96 --> 02:05:28.96
Right.

1830
02:05:28.96 --> 02:05:32.96
And you know, only because this was the emergency situation.

1831
02:05:32.96 --> 02:05:34.96
Did you improve it?

1832
02:05:34.96 --> 02:05:38.96
And you know, they said, you, you need to give us a set of coordinates.

1833
02:05:38.96 --> 02:05:41.96
You know, two or three thousand meters away.

1834
02:05:41.96 --> 02:05:46.96
To start with, letting put one bomb out there and let's see where it hits.

1835
02:05:46.96 --> 02:05:50.96
And then we'll start to adjust.

1836
02:05:50.96 --> 02:05:54.96
So I say, you know, that's all we got. Let's do it.

1837
02:05:54.96 --> 02:05:58.96
So it didn't take long to there's an L4 out in the area.

1838
02:05:58.96 --> 02:06:04.96
And I actually, you know, were using my emergency radio.

1839
02:06:04.96 --> 02:06:12.96
I was able to talk directly to the L4, which, you know, you can't normally do.

1840
02:06:12.96 --> 02:06:16.96
And, you know, he's all in the bombs away.

1841
02:06:16.96 --> 02:06:18.96
It's going to be impact about 20 seconds.

1842
02:06:18.96 --> 02:06:20.96
You got to get your head down, right?

1843
02:06:20.96 --> 02:06:24.96
You're just going to get something in the us nice to know.

1844
02:06:24.96 --> 02:06:26.96
So it goes off.

1845
02:06:26.96 --> 02:06:30.96
And, you know, it's a lot closer than, you know, 3,000 meters.

1846
02:06:30.96 --> 02:06:34.96
So I'm thinking, I'm really glad I pushed it on out there, ways.

1847
02:06:34.96 --> 02:06:38.96
And it wasn't really on the, wasn't online with the Ridge anyway.

1848
02:06:38.96 --> 02:06:42.96
Kind of went over the Ridge and down into the valley.

1849
02:06:42.96 --> 02:06:44.96
But at least I knew where it,

1850
02:06:44.96 --> 02:06:48.96
I probably were hit, so I could start to adjust in some now.

1851
02:06:48.96 --> 02:06:50.96
So we started messing with that.

1852
02:06:50.96 --> 02:06:54.96
With that irritated, the North Vietnamese,

1853
02:06:54.96 --> 02:06:58.96
they were not happy that somebody was out there trying to draw the bomb on.

1854
02:06:58.96 --> 02:07:06.96
So we, we overheard radio transmission saying,

1855
02:07:06.96 --> 02:07:08.96
shoot them in the legs.

1856
02:07:08.96 --> 02:07:10.96
Take all their Americans prisoner.

1857
02:07:10.96 --> 02:07:14.96
And we got a message coming out from Saigon.

1858
02:07:14.96 --> 02:07:18.96
They were intercepting North Vietnamese transmissions and land.

1859
02:07:18.96 --> 02:07:20.96
They planned to capture you.

1860
02:07:20.96 --> 02:07:24.96
And they're going to try to wound you and take you.

1861
02:07:24.96 --> 02:07:26.96
Okay.

1862
02:07:26.96 --> 02:07:30.96
Then we got to get these sconspots working for us here.

1863
02:07:30.96 --> 02:07:32.96
Get them in closer.

1864
02:07:32.96 --> 02:07:36.96
And the bad guys are getting closer and closer.

1865
02:07:36.96 --> 02:07:40.96
And so I start working them down.

1866
02:07:40.96 --> 02:07:42.96
And I'm kind of behind a tree.

1867
02:07:42.96 --> 02:07:46.96
And one of the bombs goes off.

1868
02:07:46.96 --> 02:07:50.96
And a piece of scrap metal.

1869
02:07:50.96 --> 02:07:52.96
Two and a half inches as long as I am.

1870
02:07:52.96 --> 02:07:56.96
There comes out across the top of my head.

1871
02:07:56.96 --> 02:07:58.96
It goes into the tree right in front of me.

1872
02:07:58.96 --> 02:08:00.96
And just cuts, you know, the line across the top of my head.

1873
02:08:00.96 --> 02:08:02.96
Is it going into the tree?

1874
02:08:02.96 --> 02:08:04.96
And I'm thinking,

1875
02:08:04.96 --> 02:08:06.96
that was close.

1876
02:08:06.96 --> 02:08:08.96
I mean, that was pretty close.

1877
02:08:08.96 --> 02:08:12.96
So, you know, I was behind a tree for a little while.

1878
02:08:12.96 --> 02:08:14.96
Once it cooled down a little bit,

1879
02:08:14.96 --> 02:08:16.96
I popped it out and I put it in my pocket.

1880
02:08:16.96 --> 02:08:18.96
I still have it at home somewhere.

1881
02:08:18.96 --> 02:08:20.96
I wanted to bring it just a joy to you.

1882
02:08:20.96 --> 02:08:22.96
But, you know, so that creased the top of my head.

1883
02:08:22.96 --> 02:08:24.96
Got my attention now.

1884
02:08:24.96 --> 02:08:26.96
You know, there's serious about doing something.

1885
02:08:26.96 --> 02:08:30.96
Eventually, you know, we do some gun battles and stuff.

1886
02:08:30.96 --> 02:08:32.96
And that's going on.

1887
02:08:32.96 --> 02:08:33.96
Is it late yet?

1888
02:08:33.96 --> 02:08:34.96
No.

1889
02:08:34.96 --> 02:08:38.96
But it's getting close when it finally did get light.

1890
02:08:38.96 --> 02:08:40.96
There was a marine squadron that came out.

1891
02:08:40.96 --> 02:08:42.96
Helicopter squadron that came out.

1892
02:08:42.96 --> 02:08:44.96
And it was gunshots.

1893
02:08:44.96 --> 02:08:46.96
And I guess the leader came over close to where the redsline was.

1894
02:08:46.96 --> 02:08:50.96
And I was like, I'm going to be a little bit closer to the redsline.

1895
02:08:50.96 --> 02:08:54.96
And I was like, I'm going to be a little bit closer to the redsline.

1896
02:08:54.96 --> 02:08:56.96
And it came over close to where the redsline was.

1897
02:08:56.96 --> 02:09:00.96
And we just received so much ground firing stuff from it.

1898
02:09:00.96 --> 02:09:02.96
He told the rest of his guys back off.

1899
02:09:02.96 --> 02:09:04.96
We're not going in there.

1900
02:09:04.96 --> 02:09:06.96
There's too much ground fire.

1901
02:09:08.96 --> 02:09:10.96
And then all of a sudden,

1902
02:09:10.96 --> 02:09:14.96
I get a call from one of the gunshot pilots.

1903
02:09:14.96 --> 02:09:16.96
And he says, I'm coming.

1904
02:09:16.96 --> 02:09:20.96
No, don't come in here.

1905
02:09:20.96 --> 02:09:22.96
If you try to fly up that ridge,

1906
02:09:22.96 --> 02:09:24.96
you're going to have to go solo.

1907
02:09:24.96 --> 02:09:26.96
You're going to fly around the tree tops.

1908
02:09:26.96 --> 02:09:27.96
And barely moving.

1909
02:09:27.96 --> 02:09:28.96
You're going to have to almost be hover.

1910
02:09:28.96 --> 02:09:30.96
They're going to knock you down.

1911
02:09:30.96 --> 02:09:31.96
Don't come in here.

1912
02:09:31.96 --> 02:09:32.96
We'll find a way.

1913
02:09:32.96 --> 02:09:34.96
Don't come up here.

1914
02:09:34.96 --> 02:09:36.96
He's down coming.

1915
02:09:36.96 --> 02:09:39.96
So this was a helo.

1916
02:09:39.96 --> 02:09:40.96
Yeah.

1917
02:09:40.96 --> 02:09:41.96
Helicopter gunshot.

1918
02:09:41.96 --> 02:09:42.96
Marine Corps helicopter gunshot.

1919
02:09:42.96 --> 02:09:44.96
So it wasn't.

1920
02:09:44.96 --> 02:09:46.96
But if you mean I could hear him coming.

1921
02:09:46.96 --> 02:09:47.96
And it wasn't a few minutes.

1922
02:09:47.96 --> 02:09:49.96
And then I heard him.

1923
02:09:49.96 --> 02:09:52.96
He said, I forgot his name.

1924
02:09:52.96 --> 02:09:54.96
Eagle claw, something.

1925
02:09:54.96 --> 02:09:55.96
Made a made a made a.

1926
02:09:55.96 --> 02:09:57.96
We're hit.

1927
02:09:57.96 --> 02:09:59.96
And we're going down.

1928
02:09:59.96 --> 02:10:01.96
And so I talked to him a little more.

1929
02:10:01.96 --> 02:10:04.96
And then he said, he sent out another made a.

1930
02:10:04.96 --> 02:10:07.96
And said, you know, we're on fire going down.

1931
02:10:07.96 --> 02:10:10.96
I'm going to try to make it to the river.

1932
02:10:10.96 --> 02:10:13.96
So I think this is not good.

1933
02:10:13.96 --> 02:10:14.96
So.

1934
02:10:14.96 --> 02:10:17.96
And he actually made it to the river.

1935
02:10:17.96 --> 02:10:22.96
And it was kind of a deep, swift flowing river.

1936
02:10:22.96 --> 02:10:24.96
Wind inside ways.

1937
02:10:24.96 --> 02:10:25.96
The pilot got out.

1938
02:10:25.96 --> 02:10:28.96
The door gunner on that side got out.

1939
02:10:28.96 --> 02:10:33.96
And the two of them got out.

1940
02:10:33.96 --> 02:10:37.96
The crew chief on the on the side.

1941
02:10:37.96 --> 02:10:38.96
It went.

1942
02:10:38.96 --> 02:10:39.96
Wind in first.

1943
02:10:39.96 --> 02:10:41.96
And the copilot.

1944
02:10:41.96 --> 02:10:44.96
It didn't get out.

1945
02:10:44.96 --> 02:10:47.96
And the guy.

1946
02:10:47.96 --> 02:10:48.96
The door gunner got out.

1947
02:10:48.96 --> 02:10:50.96
Was a good swimmer and stuff.

1948
02:10:50.96 --> 02:10:53.96
So he jumped into water and swam over there and went down.

1949
02:10:53.96 --> 02:10:55.96
You know, to try to get them.

1950
02:10:55.96 --> 02:10:57.96
The other gunner got out.

1951
02:10:57.96 --> 02:10:59.96
But the pilot couldn't get out.

1952
02:10:59.96 --> 02:11:02.96
And never saw the door gunner again.

1953
02:11:02.96 --> 02:11:04.96
He never came back up.

1954
02:11:04.96 --> 02:11:05.96
So they lost those.

1955
02:11:05.96 --> 02:11:06.96
I was too guy.

1956
02:11:06.96 --> 02:11:09.96
Too many bad guys in that area.

1957
02:11:09.96 --> 02:11:11.96
They couldn't go in to try to.

1958
02:11:11.96 --> 02:11:14.96
They didn't come out.

1959
02:11:14.96 --> 02:11:17.96
But they did get the pilot.

1960
02:11:17.96 --> 02:11:21.96
And the door gunner out.

1961
02:11:21.96 --> 02:11:23.96
And so that wasn't a good scene.

1962
02:11:23.96 --> 02:11:26.96
So how far away was that from you from your location?

1963
02:11:26.96 --> 02:11:30.96
They're there impact with the river which probably 3000 meters.

1964
02:11:30.96 --> 02:11:31.96
Okay.

1965
02:11:31.96 --> 02:11:33.96
So this is all in the vicinity of you.

1966
02:11:33.96 --> 02:11:34.96
Yeah, it's all right around me.

1967
02:11:34.96 --> 02:11:36.96
So they go in.

1968
02:11:36.96 --> 02:11:38.96
And then.

1969
02:11:38.96 --> 02:11:41.96
Yeah, we have a we have a battle.

1970
02:11:41.96 --> 02:11:43.96
And it's it's not looking good.

1971
02:11:43.96 --> 02:11:45.96
There's too many of them.

1972
02:11:45.96 --> 02:11:47.96
And we have no place to go.

1973
02:11:47.96 --> 02:11:48.96
So.

1974
02:11:48.96 --> 02:11:53.96
It eventually gets to the point where I'm talking back to.

1975
02:11:53.96 --> 02:11:55.96
To kind of be talking to the L.

1976
02:11:55.96 --> 02:11:56.96
Forers.

1977
02:11:56.96 --> 02:11:58.96
And now I have to go in.

1978
02:11:58.96 --> 02:12:03.96
You have any cluster bomb units going to see the young board.

1979
02:12:03.96 --> 02:12:05.96
And he said they did.

1980
02:12:05.96 --> 02:12:09.96
I said.

1981
02:12:09.96 --> 02:12:09.96
I said.

1982
02:12:09.96 --> 02:12:11.96
Pretty don't mind position.

1983
02:12:11.96 --> 02:12:13.96
And you know, I don't know if you've seen.

1984
02:12:13.96 --> 02:12:15.96
Clutch their bomb units, but.

1985
02:12:15.96 --> 02:12:18.96
It's a big container and it's full.

1986
02:12:18.96 --> 02:12:21.96
Small bomblets that are about the size of a great fruit.

1987
02:12:21.96 --> 02:12:23.96
Not a little bigger.

1988
02:12:23.96 --> 02:12:26.96
So it drops out about the canister comes open.

1989
02:12:26.96 --> 02:12:30.96
And you know, it just rains about 200 of those things down.

1990
02:12:30.96 --> 02:12:32.96
So I just.

1991
02:12:32.96 --> 02:12:34.96
So so how close to the enemy was all around.

1992
02:12:34.96 --> 02:12:36.96
I mean, I'm already at the point.

1993
02:12:36.96 --> 02:12:38.96
I mean, for you to be called.

1994
02:12:38.96 --> 02:12:40.96
I'm looking around your position.

1995
02:12:40.96 --> 02:12:44.96
That means you're about to be over what I'm looking around saying.

1996
02:12:44.96 --> 02:12:45.96
Man, it's just the last thing.

1997
02:12:45.96 --> 02:12:47.96
What time of day is it now?

1998
02:12:47.96 --> 02:12:49.96
It's.

1999
02:12:49.96 --> 02:12:50.96
Made morning.

2000
02:12:50.96 --> 02:12:51.96
So it's midnight.

2001
02:12:51.96 --> 02:12:53.96
So you guys have been in heavy contact the entire morning.

2002
02:12:53.96 --> 02:12:54.96
Yeah.

2003
02:12:54.96 --> 02:12:56.96
The enemy's closing in on your position.

2004
02:12:56.96 --> 02:13:01.96
They're making progress, obviously, because now you're getting to a point.

2005
02:13:01.96 --> 02:13:04.96
Because we can't go up or down.

2006
02:13:04.96 --> 02:13:07.96
I mean, in the side, just, you know, it's the sides of the ridge or beer steep.

2007
02:13:07.96 --> 02:13:10.96
So we can't go down the ridge on the sides.

2008
02:13:10.96 --> 02:13:12.96
And they're coming in.

2009
02:13:12.96 --> 02:13:14.96
And I'm thinking.

2010
02:13:14.96 --> 02:13:17.96
How long will I be able to keep pulling the trigger?

2011
02:13:17.96 --> 02:13:19.96
I mean, once I start getting hit.

2012
02:13:19.96 --> 02:13:21.96
Did you guys already blow your claymores?

2013
02:13:21.96 --> 02:13:22.96
Your perimeter claymores?

2014
02:13:22.96 --> 02:13:24.96
Claymores are going.

2015
02:13:24.96 --> 02:13:25.96
I mean, they're coming.

2016
02:13:25.96 --> 02:13:26.96
And I'm thinking.

2017
02:13:26.96 --> 02:13:28.96
And you had 20 guys in this.

2018
02:13:28.96 --> 02:13:31.96
Yeah.

2019
02:13:31.96 --> 02:13:32.96
Yeah.

2020
02:13:32.96 --> 02:13:34.96
So the perimeter we're in.

2021
02:13:34.96 --> 02:13:36.96
It's bigger than this.

2022
02:13:36.96 --> 02:13:38.96
A little bigger than this room.

2023
02:13:38.96 --> 02:13:41.96
So we're working like 15 by 15 feet.

2024
02:13:41.96 --> 02:13:42.96
Yeah.

2025
02:13:42.96 --> 02:13:44.96
It's a fairly small perimeter.

2026
02:13:44.96 --> 02:13:46.96
And you guys are surrounded by.

2027
02:13:46.96 --> 02:13:47.96
Yeah.

2028
02:13:47.96 --> 02:13:49.96
You know, the end of the house.

2029
02:13:49.96 --> 02:13:52.96
In the thousands of hardened to NVA.

2030
02:13:52.96 --> 02:13:53.96
So regular.

2031
02:13:53.96 --> 02:13:54.96
Yeah.

2032
02:13:54.96 --> 02:13:56.96
And they're coming.

2033
02:13:56.96 --> 02:13:58.96
Yeah.

2034
02:13:58.96 --> 02:14:00.96
I tell a pilot to make your first run.

2035
02:14:00.96 --> 02:14:02.96
Put it on us.

2036
02:14:02.96 --> 02:14:04.96
If you don't hear me come back on the radio.

2037
02:14:04.96 --> 02:14:07.96
And then make your next pass.

2038
02:14:07.96 --> 02:14:10.96
And just level everything on this ridge.

2039
02:14:10.96 --> 02:14:13.96
Because that means we're not here.

2040
02:14:13.96 --> 02:14:14.96
Yeah.

2041
02:14:14.96 --> 02:14:17.96
So he tells heads down his coming in.

2042
02:14:17.96 --> 02:14:19.96
And it rains all these things down.

2043
02:14:19.96 --> 02:14:22.96
And we had seven of them.

2044
02:14:22.96 --> 02:14:27.96
The land either inside the perimeter or right on the edge of the perimeter.

2045
02:14:27.96 --> 02:14:30.96
None of them went off.

2046
02:14:30.96 --> 02:14:32.96
None of them exploded.

2047
02:14:32.96 --> 02:14:35.96
But they were exploding all around us.

2048
02:14:35.96 --> 02:14:37.96
And you could hear the screams and all this stuff.

2049
02:14:37.96 --> 02:14:39.96
Because some of them were going off into trees.

2050
02:14:39.96 --> 02:14:41.96
Shrapnel is going everywhere.

2051
02:14:41.96 --> 02:14:43.96
And it broke.

2052
02:14:43.96 --> 02:14:44.96
Broke their attack.

2053
02:14:44.96 --> 02:14:45.96
Yeah.

2054
02:14:45.96 --> 02:14:47.96
So I told him to make them put another one on us.

2055
02:14:47.96 --> 02:14:48.96
Yeah.

2056
02:14:48.96 --> 02:14:49.96
That's working.

2057
02:14:49.96 --> 02:14:51.96
You can back off a little bit now.

2058
02:14:51.96 --> 02:14:53.96
So that's just divine intervention.

2059
02:14:53.96 --> 02:14:54.96
Yeah.

2060
02:14:54.96 --> 02:14:57.96
Further to seven of those cluster bombs that land inside your perimeter.

2061
02:14:57.96 --> 02:14:59.96
And none of them go off.

2062
02:14:59.96 --> 02:15:01.96
I mean that just doesn't happen.

2063
02:15:01.96 --> 02:15:03.96
You might have one or two of them go off somewhere.

2064
02:15:03.96 --> 02:15:06.96
But not all the ones that are right there.

2065
02:15:06.96 --> 02:15:08.96
And all the other ones do go off.

2066
02:15:08.96 --> 02:15:09.96
The others do go off.

2067
02:15:09.96 --> 02:15:11.96
I mean, I don't know that there were some out there.

2068
02:15:11.96 --> 02:15:12.96
Yeah.

2069
02:15:12.96 --> 02:15:14.96
They were appears that they all went off.

2070
02:15:14.96 --> 02:15:16.96
So they backed off.

2071
02:15:16.96 --> 02:15:18.96
Some things calm down a little bit.

2072
02:15:18.96 --> 02:15:20.96
So I had a bruise.

2073
02:15:20.96 --> 02:15:21.96
And then we found out now that we had a bruise.

2074
02:15:21.96 --> 02:15:23.96
So I solved that there.

2075
02:15:23.96 --> 02:15:27.96
And we had他說 as they could have told us that there was a woman

2076
02:15:27.96 --> 02:15:28.96
died of cramp and with her bruise.

2077
02:15:28.96 --> 02:15:29.96
I recorded about 10 cases.

2078
02:15:29.96 --> 02:15:28.96
So basically there was about like 10 cases,

2079
02:15:28.96 --> 02:15:30.96
So we had heard will go away.

2080
02:15:30.96 --> 02:15:31.96
But I didn't remember.

2081
02:15:31.96 --> 02:15:33.96
So sometimes seeing anything powerful,

2082
02:15:33.96 --> 02:15:35.96
those are coming from me.

2083
02:15:35.96 --> 02:15:36.96
I can't remember anything was uplifting

2084
02:15:36.96 --> 02:15:37.96
in detail.

2085
02:15:37.96 --> 02:15:39.96
I had not been in understanding that it was like that either.

2086
02:15:39.96 --> 02:15:50.68
I worry less than my soothing and everyday body or as I got up from

2087
02:15:50.68 --> 02:15:52.68
What do you want me to do?

2088
02:15:52.68 --> 02:15:55.68
So we need to identify who the person is.

2089
02:15:55.68 --> 02:16:00.68
So without going into detail, I just told him to take their

2090
02:16:00.68 --> 02:16:05.68
property action so he could be identified and bring

2091
02:16:05.68 --> 02:16:09.68
that back with him to the team.

2092
02:16:09.68 --> 02:16:15.68
So then we finally get some gunshots working now because

2093
02:16:15.68 --> 02:16:20.68
the weather started to lift up.

2094
02:16:20.68 --> 02:16:23.68
We've been bombing quite a bit during the night.

2095
02:16:23.68 --> 02:16:28.68
So we start working down toward the LZ that we can't come in on.

2096
02:16:28.68 --> 02:16:31.68
So we're going to try to get an extraction there.

2097
02:16:31.68 --> 02:16:34.68
Ran into a small ambush, but that didn't last long.

2098
02:16:34.68 --> 02:16:36.68
So we were able to keep going.

2099
02:16:36.68 --> 02:16:40.68
Got down to the LZ and we're looking around, looking for

2100
02:16:40.68 --> 02:16:44.68
bad guys, but what I see is the tail fins sticking up out of the

2101
02:16:44.68 --> 02:16:49.68
ground couple feet to the 500 pound ball sticking in the LZ

2102
02:16:49.68 --> 02:16:52.68
unexploded.

2103
02:16:52.68 --> 02:16:55.68
So now we're thinking, are we going to bring a helicopter in here

2104
02:16:55.68 --> 02:16:58.68
with a bomb setting there unexploded?

2105
02:16:58.68 --> 02:17:01.68
So excuse me, some of them.

2106
02:17:01.68 --> 02:17:03.68
We, you know, tow cubby.

2107
02:17:03.68 --> 02:17:06.68
This is what's going on.

2108
02:17:06.68 --> 02:17:10.68
We really like to get out of here because they're coming back.

2109
02:17:10.68 --> 02:17:14.68
And so we have some dialogue and they decided, okay, we're going to

2110
02:17:14.68 --> 02:17:15.68
do the extraction.

2111
02:17:15.68 --> 02:17:19.68
This is going to take five aircraft because it's out.

2112
02:17:19.68 --> 02:17:24.68
So we started rotating them in and with my team it's going to be

2113
02:17:24.68 --> 02:17:26.68
the last team out.

2114
02:17:26.68 --> 02:17:29.68
So we got to machine guns, place and fire.

2115
02:17:29.68 --> 02:17:32.68
You know, I'm trying to suppress the fire, the gunships are

2116
02:17:32.68 --> 02:17:36.68
suppressing fire, rotating those chips in.

2117
02:17:36.68 --> 02:17:40.68
And we had so many gunships and they won't use, you know, on

2118
02:17:40.68 --> 02:17:43.68
standby out there and just waiting on their term to come out.

2119
02:17:43.68 --> 02:17:44.68
It's unreal.

2120
02:17:44.68 --> 02:17:48.68
But eventually, I think it was around 1700.

2121
02:17:48.68 --> 02:17:50.68
You know, we got out.

2122
02:17:50.68 --> 02:17:54.68
So I started at 2100 the day before.

2123
02:17:54.68 --> 02:18:01.68
And, you know, 1700, we finally got extracted and headed back.

2124
02:18:01.68 --> 02:18:05.68
But we didn't, you know, get to go after the prisoners.

2125
02:18:05.68 --> 02:18:08.68
So then the question start.

2126
02:18:08.68 --> 02:18:10.68
How could they know who was on the team?

2127
02:18:10.68 --> 02:18:12.68
How could they have their frequencies?

2128
02:18:12.68 --> 02:18:14.68
They had to have a KY38.

2129
02:18:14.68 --> 02:18:18.68
Where did they get that?

2130
02:18:18.68 --> 02:18:22.68
So it was, I mean, to my knowledge, those questions whenever

2131
02:18:22.68 --> 02:18:26.68
answered, if they were answered, you know, we never found out how

2132
02:18:26.68 --> 02:18:30.68
they managed to do that.

2133
02:18:30.68 --> 02:18:36.68
You know, there was about about a two week delay between the time that

2134
02:18:36.68 --> 02:18:39.68
we did the bright light mission for Dennis' team.

2135
02:18:39.68 --> 02:18:41.68
God, and us coming back.

2136
02:18:41.68 --> 02:18:42.68
Right.

2137
02:18:42.68 --> 02:18:45.68
So, I mean, the mission had already been planned and I had to take

2138
02:18:45.68 --> 02:18:50.68
in a couple of weeks and then we get delayed a couple of weeks.

2139
02:18:50.68 --> 02:18:52.68
So there was a leak.

2140
02:18:52.68 --> 02:18:56.68
Some were had to be a leak in our compound.

2141
02:18:56.68 --> 02:18:58.68
So the information got out.

2142
02:18:58.68 --> 02:19:02.68
I mean, when you were talking to Tilt, he was saying, you know,

2143
02:19:02.68 --> 02:19:09.68
in late 69 and going into 70, whole teams are just disappearing.

2144
02:19:09.68 --> 02:19:12.68
I mean, the information was getting out somehow.

2145
02:19:12.68 --> 02:19:16.68
I mean, they were getting smarter, but the information was getting out

2146
02:19:16.68 --> 02:19:19.68
and where you're losing teams.

2147
02:19:19.68 --> 02:19:22.68
So that was a little unique because you didn't normally get your

2148
02:19:22.68 --> 02:19:24.68
bit your way here.

2149
02:19:24.68 --> 02:19:25.68
I mean, then...

2150
02:19:25.68 --> 02:19:26.68
No.

2151
02:19:26.68 --> 02:19:28.68
No, no, normally get that.

2152
02:19:28.68 --> 02:19:30.68
One point there we found out, ASTR, we got back.

2153
02:19:30.68 --> 02:19:34.68
We found that there was a point during the mission there.

2154
02:19:34.68 --> 02:19:40.68
They had actually listed us as MIA because all the radio traffic

2155
02:19:40.68 --> 02:19:43.68
they were picking up from the North Vietnamese.

2156
02:19:43.68 --> 02:19:47.68
So they had us that we really wasn't there now.

2157
02:19:47.68 --> 02:19:50.68
And all this bombing and stuff that was going on.

2158
02:19:50.68 --> 02:19:52.68
We wasn't there.

2159
02:19:52.68 --> 02:19:55.68
Didn't anyone get wounded during that?

2160
02:19:55.68 --> 02:19:57.68
Yeah, trapped in stuff.

2161
02:19:57.68 --> 02:19:59.68
No one was killed.

2162
02:19:59.68 --> 02:20:01.68
But, you know, we'd trapped no.

2163
02:20:01.68 --> 02:20:05.68
I got the top of my head cut.

2164
02:20:05.68 --> 02:20:11.68
And you got that qualification of calling a cluster bomb in on your position.

2165
02:20:11.68 --> 02:20:13.68
Which is a pretty rare one to walk away from.

2166
02:20:13.68 --> 02:20:17.68
Yeah, and so I guess today, you know,

2167
02:20:17.68 --> 02:20:21.68
in this day when I hear people saying,

2168
02:20:21.68 --> 02:20:25.68
ban cluster bombs, you know, you use cluster bombs.

2169
02:20:25.68 --> 02:20:29.68
I'm saying, man, I'm glad that thing was around at least one time.

2170
02:20:29.68 --> 02:20:33.68
Yeah, that's sort of the, you know, that's like the,

2171
02:20:33.68 --> 02:20:37.68
I don't always say the ultimate horrible situation.

2172
02:20:37.68 --> 02:20:41.68
It doesn't get you worse than when you are calling for

2173
02:20:41.68 --> 02:20:43.68
air strikes on your position.

2174
02:20:43.68 --> 02:20:46.68
That's the absolute, that's the last thing you do, right?

2175
02:20:46.68 --> 02:20:47.68
That's when you say,

2176
02:20:47.68 --> 02:20:51.68
you know, you're going to be overrun where probably get a die.

2177
02:20:51.68 --> 02:20:55.68
This is our last ditch if effort is the ultimate of all hail marries.

2178
02:20:55.68 --> 02:20:57.68
This is it.

2179
02:20:57.68 --> 02:20:59.68
Call for fire on our position.

2180
02:20:59.68 --> 02:20:59.68
And that's what you did.

2181
02:20:59.68 --> 02:21:03.68
And by the grace of God, those browns that hit inside your perimeter.

2182
02:21:03.68 --> 02:21:05.68
That's the only way you can explain it.

2183
02:21:05.68 --> 02:21:06.68
I'm telling you.

2184
02:21:06.68 --> 02:21:08.68
And give me one other.

2185
02:21:08.68 --> 02:21:13.68
So I'm trying to get the last tail of copter loaded and get my guys on it.

2186
02:21:13.68 --> 02:21:15.68
And this one's going to sound strange too.

2187
02:21:15.68 --> 02:21:19.68
But I'm standing right next to the helicopter and putting people on.

2188
02:21:19.68 --> 02:21:23.68
And I hear a voice that says drop.

2189
02:21:23.68 --> 02:21:27.68
A loud voice that says drop.

2190
02:21:27.68 --> 02:21:31.68
Without hesitation, I just collapsed to my knees.

2191
02:21:31.68 --> 02:21:37.68
And as I did about a 10 round burst of machine gun rounds.

2192
02:21:37.68 --> 02:21:41.68
Hit the side of the chopper right where my head was.

2193
02:21:41.68 --> 02:21:44.68
I mean, a fraction of a second later.

2194
02:21:44.68 --> 02:21:48.68
And I would have been decaped and decapitated.

2195
02:21:48.68 --> 02:21:52.68
I mean, there were things like that happening throughout.

2196
02:21:52.68 --> 02:21:54.68
And you think, what did this come from?

2197
02:21:54.68 --> 02:21:56.68
How is all this happening?

2198
02:21:56.68 --> 02:21:58.68
It's beyond coincidence.

2199
02:21:58.68 --> 02:22:00.68
Yeah, it is.

2200
02:22:00.68 --> 02:22:04.68
And it was definitely an interesting mission.

2201
02:22:04.68 --> 02:22:10.68
I just, you know, very upset that we didn't get to go after the pureed evidence.

2202
02:22:10.68 --> 02:22:13.68
But what's a peri.

2203
02:22:13.68 --> 02:22:15.68
What is it called?

2204
02:22:15.68 --> 02:22:17.68
Peri fire.

2205
02:22:17.68 --> 02:22:18.68
Peri fire.

2206
02:22:18.68 --> 02:22:21.68
So the area of operations is.

2207
02:22:21.68 --> 02:22:23.68
They would call it prairie.

2208
02:22:23.68 --> 02:22:27.68
And then the prairie fire emergency was when there was a bad situation.

2209
02:22:27.68 --> 02:22:29.68
And where these guys need to get extracted.

2210
02:22:29.68 --> 02:22:32.68
That's the that's the prairie fire emergency.

2211
02:22:32.68 --> 02:22:34.68
They kept in the forward for us to.

2212
02:22:34.68 --> 02:22:36.68
Be captured.

2213
02:22:36.68 --> 02:22:38.68
Are discovered.

2214
02:22:38.68 --> 02:22:42.68
So whatever it took to make sure that we were not.

2215
02:22:42.68 --> 02:22:53.68
And if you read the sodg material, you'll read about here about that, you know, sometimes a team,

2216
02:22:53.68 --> 02:23:02.68
which rumored at least that sometimes of B-50-T strike was put on teams that disappeared to make sure there were no survivors.

2217
02:23:02.68 --> 02:23:06.68
I've been, I've done bomb assessment damages.

2218
02:23:06.68 --> 02:23:14.68
I have to be 50-T strikes. Never had one put on me. And, you know, this would have been a good down for an up-at-one.

2219
02:23:14.68 --> 02:23:16.68
Out there if they were going to do that.

2220
02:23:16.68 --> 02:23:18.68
But I don't know that that's true.

2221
02:23:18.68 --> 02:23:28.68
But you know that you had volunteered to go on a mission where you can't under any circumstances be taken alive.

2222
02:23:28.68 --> 02:23:30.68
So.

2223
02:23:30.68 --> 02:23:34.68
You have another mission highlighted where it just says a prisoner snatch.

2224
02:23:34.68 --> 02:23:37.68
22 caliber pistol with a silencer.

2225
02:23:37.68 --> 02:23:40.68
Did you ever get your prisoner?

2226
02:23:40.68 --> 02:23:43.68
I never got one of my.

2227
02:23:43.68 --> 02:23:44.68
Why?

2228
02:23:44.68 --> 02:23:48.68
And at what point did your nickname, or your codename, turn determinator?

2229
02:23:48.68 --> 02:23:52.68
Because I'm thinking it might have had something to do with this.

2230
02:23:52.68 --> 02:23:58.68
Yeah, it was, it was actually after sawg on some other things I was doing.

2231
02:23:58.68 --> 02:24:06.68
I had commanders, you know, starting with Dick Meadows, that started this thing about,

2232
02:24:06.68 --> 02:24:10.68
you know, you're the most relentless person I've ever seen.

2233
02:24:10.68 --> 02:24:14.68
I, you're the last person in the world I want to have come in after me.

2234
02:24:14.68 --> 02:24:16.68
Because you just want to stop.

2235
02:24:16.68 --> 02:24:22.68
And, you know, I had other commanders that, you know, after that, saying the same thing.

2236
02:24:22.68 --> 02:24:26.68
And they have to, you know, terminator movie came out.

2237
02:24:26.68 --> 02:24:29.68
So they, they named that movie after you got it.

2238
02:24:29.68 --> 02:24:32.68
But then, you know, the name all of a sudden was prominent.

2239
02:24:32.68 --> 02:24:39.68
And, you know, so, you know, they said, your, your name's really, you know, terminator.

2240
02:24:39.68 --> 02:24:42.68
So I kind of hung on to that one.

2241
02:24:42.68 --> 02:24:47.68
I usually does a race name, do Iron Man competitions and stuff.

2242
02:24:47.68 --> 02:24:51.68
And I had a good conversation with, when I was talking to till,

2243
02:24:51.68 --> 02:24:54.68
and he was, he went through a lot of the scenarios that he described was,

2244
02:24:54.68 --> 02:24:57.68
he was talking about the dogs that would be coming after him.

2245
02:24:57.68 --> 02:24:58.68
Oh, yeah.

2246
02:24:58.68 --> 02:25:00.68
And, you know, I asked till they said, do you like dogs?

2247
02:25:00.68 --> 02:25:01.68
He says I hate dogs.

2248
02:25:01.68 --> 02:25:03.68
And he said it without a moment of hesitation.

2249
02:25:03.68 --> 02:25:04.68
I said, what do you think of dogs now?

2250
02:25:04.68 --> 02:25:05.68
He said I hate dogs.

2251
02:25:05.68 --> 02:25:08.68
And, of course, he also said his wife likes dogs.

2252
02:25:08.68 --> 02:25:09.68
And therefore, they have dogs.

2253
02:25:09.68 --> 02:25:10.68
Yeah.

2254
02:25:10.68 --> 02:25:13.68
But are you, are you scarred from, from dogs as well?

2255
02:25:13.68 --> 02:25:14.68
No.

2256
02:25:14.68 --> 02:25:15.68
Yeah.

2257
02:25:15.68 --> 02:25:23.68
Even though I do have a robotic dog, I've had a lot of dogs, you know, across the years.

2258
02:25:23.68 --> 02:25:26.68
But you can deal with dogs.

2259
02:25:26.68 --> 02:25:30.68
I mean, they tend to give you position away sometimes.

2260
02:25:30.68 --> 02:25:35.68
But, you know, they're 22, pistol with a silence.

2261
02:25:35.68 --> 02:25:39.68
They're still going to make some noise.

2262
02:25:39.68 --> 02:25:46.68
But if the dog gets far enough away from the group, you know, you can take him out.

2263
02:25:46.68 --> 02:25:47.68
You know, we'd want to those.

2264
02:25:47.68 --> 02:25:52.68
You can put out CES powder, you know, on the trail.

2265
02:25:52.68 --> 02:25:56.68
And that really screws that are smell up when they sniff that.

2266
02:25:56.68 --> 02:25:58.68
So they're ways to deal with dogs.

2267
02:25:58.68 --> 02:26:03.68
But yeah, it scares you a little bit when you realize they're coming after you have dogs.

2268
02:26:03.68 --> 02:26:06.68
I prefer trackers because I know how to get them.

2269
02:26:06.68 --> 02:26:09.68
I don't, I don't miss trackers.

2270
02:26:09.68 --> 02:26:12.68
They will step on one of my lines.

2271
02:26:12.68 --> 02:26:16.68
So the hardest trackers to get rid of.

2272
02:26:16.68 --> 02:26:20.68
When they put three of them out there,

2273
02:26:20.68 --> 02:26:24.68
it different locations with a couple pieces of bamboo.

2274
02:26:24.68 --> 02:26:26.68
And they'll crack the bamboo over here.

2275
02:26:26.68 --> 02:26:30.68
And you'll hear that and you say, well, we're not going that way.

2276
02:26:30.68 --> 02:26:32.68
So we start to turn this way.

2277
02:26:32.68 --> 02:26:35.68
And if you go too far, you'll hear your clock and over on this side.

2278
02:26:35.68 --> 02:26:37.68
Those are actually channeling.

2279
02:26:37.68 --> 02:26:39.68
They're channeling you right in 10 a.m.

2280
02:26:39.68 --> 02:26:41.68
But you know that's going to happen.

2281
02:26:41.68 --> 02:26:44.68
So it's hard to put out toe poppers or something for those guys.

2282
02:26:44.68 --> 02:26:46.68
Because they're so far away from you.

2283
02:26:46.68 --> 02:26:48.68
And you don't know where they're going to walk.

2284
02:26:48.68 --> 02:26:50.68
They don't get to them.

2285
02:26:50.68 --> 02:26:53.68
So that makes it more interesting.

2286
02:26:53.68 --> 02:26:56.68
You got to get away because you know they're hurting you right.

2287
02:26:56.68 --> 02:26:57.68
So they're dead and.

2288
02:26:57.68 --> 02:27:00.68
What was the deal with the note you have in here about the 22.

2289
02:27:00.68 --> 02:27:04.68
The Hosh Poppy 22 with the silencer and the prison snatch.

2290
02:27:04.68 --> 02:27:07.68
Was that just another failed prison snatch?

2291
02:27:07.68 --> 02:27:09.68
Well, it was another technique.

2292
02:27:09.68 --> 02:27:14.68
Yeah, I had trouble keeping them alive.

2293
02:27:14.68 --> 02:27:20.68
But with the 22, we used a similar scenario as the ambush we were talking about.

2294
02:27:20.68 --> 02:27:23.68
Where I had a I shot the 22.

2295
02:27:23.68 --> 02:27:27.68
I would shoot the guy in the thigh.

2296
02:27:27.68 --> 02:27:29.68
And it would it would sting enough.

2297
02:27:29.68 --> 02:27:32.68
It would cause them to drop their hands from the weapon.

2298
02:27:32.68 --> 02:27:34.68
And then thumper.

2299
02:27:34.68 --> 02:27:37.68
You know, would take him down.

2300
02:27:37.68 --> 02:27:39.68
I'd hit the morphine in him.

2301
02:27:39.68 --> 02:27:41.68
And you know, that was the plan.

2302
02:27:41.68 --> 02:27:46.68
So I hit the female artery one time with the 22 of all the, I mean,

2303
02:27:46.68 --> 02:27:47.68
I'll hold leg there.

2304
02:27:47.68 --> 02:27:49.68
And I hit the David artery.

2305
02:27:49.68 --> 02:27:51.68
You know, so the guy I've led to death.

2306
02:27:51.68 --> 02:27:56.68
I mean, just just little accidents like that.

2307
02:27:56.68 --> 02:27:59.68
Got in a way.

2308
02:27:59.68 --> 02:28:00.68
But.

2309
02:28:00.68 --> 02:28:03.68
And I didn't have, but one of the other teams said they had one.

2310
02:28:03.68 --> 02:28:04.68
And he was alive.

2311
02:28:04.68 --> 02:28:06.68
They were coming out on strings.

2312
02:28:06.68 --> 02:28:10.68
And one other little guys was was holding the guy.

2313
02:28:10.68 --> 02:28:14.68
And even though he'd been dragged up a little, he was just holding him.

2314
02:28:14.68 --> 02:28:16.68
And they were about 3,000 feet.

2315
02:28:16.68 --> 02:28:20.68
And this guy started coming to and decided he was not going to be a prisoner.

2316
02:28:20.68 --> 02:28:24.68
So he started kicking and squarming and biting the guy in the face.

2317
02:28:24.68 --> 02:28:27.68
And and it a little guy said, okay.

2318
02:28:27.68 --> 02:28:29.68
Just you wrote that option.

2319
02:28:29.68 --> 02:28:33.68
Option two and yeah, 3,000 feet is turned in loose and watched and disappeared into the

2320
02:28:33.68 --> 02:28:34.68
canopy.

2321
02:28:34.68 --> 02:28:37.68
So that was somebody else's bad luck on that.

2322
02:28:37.68 --> 02:28:41.68
That wasn't mine.

2323
02:28:41.68 --> 02:28:47.68
And at this point, you got to be close to your one year run over there.

2324
02:28:47.68 --> 02:28:54.68
And are you starting to feel any of the any the short time mentality you started to think

2325
02:28:54.68 --> 02:28:58.68
goes the last mission wins the last one or you starting to feel that at all?

2326
02:28:58.68 --> 02:29:03.68
I started to feel not so much the last mission, but I started to feel like.

2327
02:29:03.68 --> 02:29:07.68
I mean, they hit this compound from time to time.

2328
02:29:07.68 --> 02:29:10.68
So I've been over there, you know, a year.

2329
02:29:10.68 --> 02:29:14.68
So I go to the supply room and I say.

2330
02:29:14.68 --> 02:29:18.68
I'd like to sign out of black jacket and a steel pot.

2331
02:29:18.68 --> 02:29:20.68
And you're saying, why?

2332
02:29:20.68 --> 02:29:24.68
I said, I, you know, next time the siren goes off and we head for the bunkers.

2333
02:29:24.68 --> 02:29:27.68
I'm going to have on the flag jacket and steel pot.

2334
02:29:27.68 --> 02:29:29.68
So I don't have long left.

2335
02:29:29.68 --> 02:29:33.68
And I don't want to, you know, somebody's lucky shot to take me out.

2336
02:29:33.68 --> 02:29:36.68
How many, what was that like last month you were there?

2337
02:29:36.68 --> 02:29:37.68
Yeah, last few weeks.

2338
02:29:37.68 --> 02:29:39.68
You think I made it this fall.

2339
02:29:39.68 --> 02:29:40.68
I'm not going to get hit by it.

2340
02:29:40.68 --> 02:29:42.68
No, it was just from the ag in the compound.

2341
02:29:42.68 --> 02:29:43.68
Because you would see people.

2342
02:29:43.68 --> 02:29:48.68
I had another friend in my under that had been with it for a long time before I'm so.

2343
02:29:48.68 --> 02:29:54.68
He only had a couple weeks left before he was going home.

2344
02:29:54.68 --> 02:29:58.68
And they had a mission come up and he volunteered to go on it.

2345
02:29:58.68 --> 02:30:02.68
And I said, Pete, what are you doing?

2346
02:30:02.68 --> 02:30:04.68
He got two weeks, man.

2347
02:30:04.68 --> 02:30:08.68
He said, they need a potential leader to go out with his company.

2348
02:30:08.68 --> 02:30:10.68
So I'm going to do it.

2349
02:30:10.68 --> 02:30:12.68
No, no, no, no, no.

2350
02:30:12.68 --> 02:30:14.68
I was just last month.

2351
02:30:14.68 --> 02:30:17.68
You know, so you see people like that.

2352
02:30:17.68 --> 02:30:22.68
So I tried not to think of anything as this is my last one.

2353
02:30:22.68 --> 02:30:26.68
This is what I'm going to do this week of whatever.

2354
02:30:26.68 --> 02:30:29.68
It's not my last one.

2355
02:30:29.68 --> 02:30:35.68
But I did think about, yeah, when I'm running to that bunker, maybe it's still

2356
02:30:35.68 --> 02:30:36.68
a part of like that.

2357
02:30:36.68 --> 02:30:38.68
It wouldn't be okay.

2358
02:30:38.68 --> 02:30:39.68
It's night.

2359
02:30:39.68 --> 02:30:41.68
It's relatively cool.

2360
02:30:41.68 --> 02:30:43.68
So I'll be right.

2361
02:30:43.68 --> 02:30:45.68
So how did it, how did the deployment?

2362
02:30:45.68 --> 02:30:54.68
So I finished up and left there went back down to the train.

2363
02:30:54.68 --> 02:31:00.68
You know, to process out, they told me, now you're going to be stuck here for a couple

2364
02:31:00.68 --> 02:31:03.68
of weeks or so before we can get you on a plane home.

2365
02:31:03.68 --> 02:31:05.68
So I went over to the S.F.

2366
02:31:05.68 --> 02:31:09.68
I had quarters and I said, I need help.

2367
02:31:09.68 --> 02:31:11.68
So there was an NCO there.

2368
02:31:11.68 --> 02:31:13.68
What can I do for you?

2369
02:31:13.68 --> 02:31:15.68
I said, I need to go on a plane tonight.

2370
02:31:15.68 --> 02:31:18.68
And he said, let me see what I can do.

2371
02:31:18.68 --> 02:31:19.68
Yeah.

2372
02:31:19.68 --> 02:31:23.68
So I go out and party with some other guys that I know.

2373
02:31:23.68 --> 02:31:28.68
But two o'clock in the morning, somebody's knocking on my door and this guy's there saying,

2374
02:31:28.68 --> 02:31:33.68
I need you to get over, I forgot what they call the place you had to go through.

2375
02:31:33.68 --> 02:31:35.68
But you need to get over there right away.

2376
02:31:35.68 --> 02:31:38.68
So they can process you through and get you on the plane.

2377
02:31:38.68 --> 02:31:40.68
So are you a captain now at this point?

2378
02:31:40.68 --> 02:31:41.68
No, you still are.

2379
02:31:41.68 --> 02:31:43.68
First of all, you're still a first of all.

2380
02:31:43.68 --> 02:31:46.68
So at this point are you thinking you're staying in the army?

2381
02:31:46.68 --> 02:31:48.68
I'm thinking I may stick around for a while.

2382
02:31:48.68 --> 02:31:52.68
I mean, could you, you know, I had thought it was going to be three years.

2383
02:31:52.68 --> 02:32:03.68
But when you get into an organization that has the latest greatest gadgets and missions and a

2384
02:32:03.68 --> 02:32:08.68
Spreed of core, I mean, you can't just walk away from there.

2385
02:32:08.68 --> 02:32:10.68
I mean, that's hard to get to walk to.

2386
02:32:10.68 --> 02:32:12.68
Yeah, it's all, it's all down here.

2387
02:32:12.68 --> 02:32:13.68
There's nothing else.

2388
02:32:13.68 --> 02:32:15.68
There's like the guys that come back from walking on the moon.

2389
02:32:15.68 --> 02:32:17.68
Yeah, what are you going to do?

2390
02:32:17.68 --> 02:32:18.68
Yeah.

2391
02:32:18.68 --> 02:32:25.68
I mean, we had everything from the little tiny grenades, much bigger than a job record that they gave us the

2392
02:32:25.68 --> 02:32:26.68
test.

2393
02:32:26.68 --> 02:32:29.68
I had a rocket pistol rocket.

2394
02:32:29.68 --> 02:32:32.68
This was a little, a little expand.

2395
02:32:32.68 --> 02:32:37.68
It was like, it was like a little 10 gun that you probably played with when you were a kid.

2396
02:32:37.68 --> 02:32:43.68
You stick a cork in the end of it and you squeeze the little trigger and it pops the cork out on a little

2397
02:32:43.68 --> 02:32:50.68
string. This thing popped out of 50 caliber round with a rocket in the back of it.

2398
02:32:50.68 --> 02:32:56.68
I mean, they gave us this and you know what?

2399
02:32:56.68 --> 02:32:57.68
I thought, was this cool?

2400
02:32:57.68 --> 02:32:58.68
He didn't make much noise.

2401
02:32:58.68 --> 02:33:00.68
They sound like shooting a bottle rocket.

2402
02:33:00.68 --> 02:33:01.68
It's just a woosh.

2403
02:33:01.68 --> 02:33:07.68
I mean, this thing's big as you thumb and it's solid steel.

2404
02:33:07.68 --> 02:33:08.68
I mean, no one else side still.

2405
02:33:08.68 --> 02:33:10.68
What was it, what did they build it for?

2406
02:33:10.68 --> 02:33:11.68
What was the purpose of it?

2407
02:33:11.68 --> 02:33:15.68
It was something really quiet that had a tremendous penetrating power.

2408
02:33:15.68 --> 02:33:18.68
So like you take a vehicle out with it or something?

2409
02:33:18.68 --> 02:33:21.68
Not a vehicle, but you know, did you go right through a vest?

2410
02:33:21.68 --> 02:33:23.68
I mean, I got it.

2411
02:33:23.68 --> 02:33:24.68
Unless I was right here.

2412
02:33:24.68 --> 02:33:27.68
If I shot you with it right here, it bounced off of you.

2413
02:33:27.68 --> 02:33:28.68
Because it wouldn't have.

2414
02:33:28.68 --> 02:33:31.68
It takes about 10 to 15 feet to build up the speed.

2415
02:33:31.68 --> 02:33:35.68
But beyond that, I mean, I shot it through two by fours.

2416
02:33:35.68 --> 02:33:38.68
I mean, you just couldn't stop it.

2417
02:33:38.68 --> 02:33:42.68
But again, I tried to use it.

2418
02:33:42.68 --> 02:33:46.68
And I figured I'll take this guy out because it's going to be really quiet.

2419
02:33:46.68 --> 02:33:52.68
And so I get it up and it's night and I go click.

2420
02:33:52.68 --> 02:33:55.68
And you can hear the click.

2421
02:33:55.68 --> 02:33:58.68
No rocket.

2422
02:33:58.68 --> 02:34:03.68
So one of the other guys had to take you out because this thing didn't work.

2423
02:34:03.68 --> 02:34:07.68
So they got rid of those because they had such a malfunction

2424
02:34:07.68 --> 02:34:08.68
rate.

2425
02:34:08.68 --> 02:34:09.68
Well, I mean, go Google it.

2426
02:34:09.68 --> 02:34:10.68
Go.

2427
02:34:10.68 --> 02:34:11.68
Rocket pistol.

2428
02:34:11.68 --> 02:34:12.68
Rocket pistol.

2429
02:34:12.68 --> 02:34:14.68
I mean, their video is out there.

2430
02:34:14.68 --> 02:34:17.68
People shoot no man trying to make them work.

2431
02:34:17.68 --> 02:34:18.68
Sometimes they work.

2432
02:34:18.68 --> 02:34:19.68
Sometimes they don't.

2433
02:34:19.68 --> 02:34:21.68
So you're around your, is this around your three year mark?

2434
02:34:21.68 --> 02:34:24.68
You must be around the three or he'd you already re-enlisted or you was re-enlistment

2435
02:34:24.68 --> 02:34:25.68
coming up.

2436
02:34:25.68 --> 02:34:32.68
Well, because because I went to OCS, then I incur extra time.

2437
02:34:32.68 --> 02:34:33.68
Okay.

2438
02:34:33.68 --> 02:34:35.68
So I had to stick around.

2439
02:34:35.68 --> 02:34:41.68
And if I was going to accept captain in all I had to go and definitely.

2440
02:34:41.68 --> 02:34:47.68
So so the weird thing is you're your inviant nom, you're insog, you're conducting these crazy

2441
02:34:47.68 --> 02:34:48.68
operations.

2442
02:34:48.68 --> 02:34:49.68
You barely live through this.

2443
02:34:49.68 --> 02:34:54.68
And then you, you all of a sudden, two o'clock in the morning, you're still drunk,

2444
02:34:54.68 --> 02:34:55.68
probably.

2445
02:34:55.68 --> 02:35:00.68
You, it's every knocks on your door and says, hey, you're going home.

2446
02:35:00.68 --> 02:35:01.68
Yeah.

2447
02:35:01.68 --> 02:35:05.68
I go down to get on the plane.

2448
02:35:05.68 --> 02:35:07.68
You're going through a little security thing.

2449
02:35:07.68 --> 02:35:11.68
And the guy says, what's that in your pants?

2450
02:35:11.68 --> 02:35:14.68
Yeah.

2451
02:35:14.68 --> 02:35:16.68
And I said, you mean this?

2452
02:35:16.68 --> 02:35:17.68
And he said, yes.

2453
02:35:17.68 --> 02:35:18.68
And I said, it's a war trophy.

2454
02:35:18.68 --> 02:35:20.68
And he just says, okay.

2455
02:35:20.68 --> 02:35:22.68
I put it back down in my pants.

2456
02:35:22.68 --> 02:35:25.68
And I got on that civilian aircraft and off I go.

2457
02:35:25.68 --> 02:35:28.68
And thinking nobody's going to hijack this thing.

2458
02:35:28.68 --> 02:35:32.68
It's ready.

2459
02:35:32.68 --> 02:35:37.68
You got off the plane with it in San Francisco or I think it was in San Francisco

2460
02:35:37.68 --> 02:35:41.68
or LA one of the TV and went right on to do there.

2461
02:35:41.68 --> 02:35:44.68
Of course you didn't have the security checks and things like that.

2462
02:35:44.68 --> 02:35:51.68
So now you're in either San Francisco, you're somewhere in California, you're whatever.

2463
02:35:51.68 --> 02:35:57.68
You're 48 hours or 72 hours or something less than a couple days, few days out of the bush.

2464
02:35:57.68 --> 02:36:00.68
How's that transition?

2465
02:36:00.68 --> 02:36:03.68
It's tough.

2466
02:36:03.68 --> 02:36:06.68
It's a different world back here.

2467
02:36:06.68 --> 02:36:14.68
Aside from the protest and all that, it's just a totally different environment, different world.

2468
02:36:14.68 --> 02:36:24.68
I've come from the wallwrest, I've come from a world where I didn't have all these rules of engagement

2469
02:36:24.68 --> 02:36:30.68
that you have now. The rule of engagement was if I see you, I kill you.

2470
02:36:30.68 --> 02:36:35.68
If I run across somebody out in the area of operations, I terminate them.

2471
02:36:35.68 --> 02:36:39.68
You're a bad guy. You don't have to have a weapon.

2472
02:36:39.68 --> 02:36:42.68
You don't have to be doing anything aggressive toward me.

2473
02:36:42.68 --> 02:36:44.68
I just have to see you.

2474
02:36:44.68 --> 02:36:46.68
Because you're not supposed to see me.

2475
02:36:46.68 --> 02:36:51.68
So if I let you see me, then I basically signed your death warrant.

2476
02:36:51.68 --> 02:36:57.68
Now I'm in a world where you get in the rules, their laws, their all kinds of things.

2477
02:36:57.68 --> 02:37:00.68
You can't do that.

2478
02:37:00.68 --> 02:37:10.68
And what did the Army do to help you reintroduce reintegrate to being back in America?

2479
02:37:10.68 --> 02:37:19.68
At that point, the reintegration was, here's your next assignment you're going to be a reindering instructor in a reindered department.

2480
02:37:19.68 --> 02:37:23.68
Okay. I'm saying, okay, I can do that.

2481
02:37:23.68 --> 02:37:27.68
I mean, I wanted to be a reindering instructor.

2482
02:37:27.68 --> 02:37:31.68
So I get that particular job.

2483
02:37:31.68 --> 02:37:39.68
And I thought, I've got maybe eight months at the most before I'm going to be back.

2484
02:37:39.68 --> 02:37:44.68
So what better place to put me than as a reindering instructor,

2485
02:37:44.68 --> 02:37:50.68
going out and evaluating reinders to you and it's on small patrols tactics, all that kind of stuff,

2486
02:37:50.68 --> 02:37:53.68
and having a journal.

2487
02:37:53.68 --> 02:37:58.68
And here's how I can prove this technique that I used in SOC.

2488
02:37:58.68 --> 02:38:01.68
Here's how I can practice slipping up on people.

2489
02:38:01.68 --> 02:38:05.68
And more, I can improve all the techniques that I've been using there.

2490
02:38:05.68 --> 02:38:09.68
I can go improve them. I can spend more time with a range.

2491
02:38:09.68 --> 02:38:15.68
I can use them. I had a range shooting, improve my markmanship skills, my listening skills, my night movement skills.

2492
02:38:15.68 --> 02:38:20.68
I can go out and work on this stuff for eight months, journal it.

2493
02:38:20.68 --> 02:38:27.68
And when I get back to SOC, I'm going to be a better SOC guy than I was when I was there before.

2494
02:38:27.68 --> 02:38:32.68
Well, I'll tell you what, we've been going for another two hours and 40 minutes.

2495
02:38:32.68 --> 02:38:41.68
We're going to pick up with your Ranger instructor, period of your life on the next podcast.

2496
02:38:41.68 --> 02:38:42.68
Okay, good.

2497
02:38:42.68 --> 02:38:44.68
Thanks for coming on.

2498
02:38:44.68 --> 02:38:45.68
Thank you very much.

2499
02:38:45.68 --> 02:38:50.68
And yeah, I think that's not just thanks for coming on, it's thanks for everything.

2500
02:38:50.68 --> 02:38:53.68
We'll talk to you on the next podcast.

2501
02:38:53.68 --> 02:38:55.68
Okay, thank you.

2502
02:38:55.68 --> 02:39:09.68
Well, once again, Colonel Henry Dick Thompson has left the building and has once again left me in a complete sense of awe.

2503
02:39:09.68 --> 02:39:15.68
Because we're talking about just absolute insanity.

2504
02:39:15.68 --> 02:39:31.68
And the fact that the men of SOC did what the men of SOC did and the fact that the fact that we get to sit here and talk to some of them is just unbelievable.

2505
02:39:31.68 --> 02:39:42.68
Because who who survives what he did, who survives what tilt did, who survives what the Frenchman did.

2506
02:39:42.68 --> 02:39:45.68
Not many.

2507
02:39:45.68 --> 02:39:52.68
And that's something that we need to remember as awesome as it is to sit here and hear these stories.

2508
02:39:52.68 --> 02:39:56.68
Remember that they're not just stories.

2509
02:39:56.68 --> 02:40:02.68
That these were people's lives and these were people's deaths.

2510
02:40:02.68 --> 02:40:08.68
And so many of these men did not return.

2511
02:40:08.68 --> 02:40:16.68
And they gave their lives so that we can live ours.

2512
02:40:16.68 --> 02:40:27.68
And here we are forever indicted to them, to their sacrifice.

2513
02:40:27.68 --> 02:40:37.68
And while I know that that we cannot ever repay them,

2514
02:40:37.68 --> 02:40:42.68
it's just impossible.

2515
02:40:42.68 --> 02:41:03.68
But what we do know is that the best we can do to attempt to repay them, this to live our lives every day in a way that venerates their sacrifices.

2516
02:41:03.68 --> 02:41:09.68
So don't just live.

2517
02:41:09.68 --> 02:41:15.68
Don't just be.

2518
02:41:15.68 --> 02:41:26.68
Instead be everything that you are capable of being.

2519
02:41:26.68 --> 02:41:32.68
That's what we need to do.

2520
02:41:32.68 --> 02:41:47.68
So echoing, I guess that being everything we are capable of being starts out with us just being capable.

2521
02:41:47.68 --> 02:41:50.68
You like that word capable.

2522
02:41:50.68 --> 02:41:53.68
You went through a hole.

2523
02:41:53.68 --> 02:41:56.68
You went through a hole.

2524
02:41:56.68 --> 02:42:03.68
You were kind of...

2525
02:42:03.68 --> 02:42:06.68
You latched onto something that I said.

2526
02:42:06.68 --> 02:42:13.68
But then you kind of adjusted it to it made sense to you in a clear way.

2527
02:42:13.68 --> 02:42:17.68
I would say even more accurately put where I latched onto it exactly.

2528
02:42:17.68 --> 02:42:19.68
Good way of putting it.

2529
02:42:19.68 --> 02:42:24.68
I latched onto it and then just sort of like, how you go down that wormhole more and more and more.

2530
02:42:24.68 --> 02:42:29.68
And that and playing the long game versus the shirk.

2531
02:42:29.68 --> 02:42:30.68
That's another.

2532
02:42:30.68 --> 02:42:31.68
That's another.

2533
02:42:31.68 --> 02:42:33.68
For sure because that's really what it kind of is.

2534
02:42:33.68 --> 02:42:36.68
It's almost like every decision you make.

2535
02:42:36.68 --> 02:42:39.68
Most decisions that you make are going to land on like one of those things.

2536
02:42:39.68 --> 02:42:40.68
Like okay.

2537
02:42:40.68 --> 02:42:41.68
And a lot of times both of them.

2538
02:42:41.68 --> 02:42:42.68
So you're like okay.

2539
02:42:42.68 --> 02:42:45.68
Am I going to play the long game here or the shirk game?

2540
02:42:45.68 --> 02:42:46.68
And that's everything pretty much.

2541
02:42:46.68 --> 02:42:49.68
And then the other one I want to be capable or comfortable.

2542
02:42:49.68 --> 02:42:51.68
That's the other two like okay.

2543
02:42:51.68 --> 02:42:54.68
If you can kind of keep that in your mind.

2544
02:42:54.68 --> 02:42:57.68
Your decision making will be a lot better for yourself.

2545
02:42:57.68 --> 02:42:59.68
It's interesting though this little.

2546
02:42:59.68 --> 02:43:02.68
This little play on words a little bit of a play on words.

2547
02:43:02.68 --> 02:43:06.68
I just said right if you want to be everything you're capable of being.

2548
02:43:06.68 --> 02:43:09.68
Well it starts with just being capable in the first place.

2549
02:43:09.68 --> 02:43:10.68
Yes.

2550
02:43:10.68 --> 02:43:16.68
Where do we need to be capable and how can we improve our capabilities.

2551
02:43:16.68 --> 02:43:18.68
Physically mentally.

2552
02:43:18.68 --> 02:43:20.68
Any motion only.

2553
02:43:20.68 --> 02:43:21.68
I spiritually.

2554
02:43:21.68 --> 02:43:23.68
And spiritually I think yes.

2555
02:43:23.68 --> 02:43:26.68
Because some people will tell you no not spiritually.

2556
02:43:26.68 --> 02:43:27.68
Really.

2557
02:43:27.68 --> 02:43:29.68
Well then again what is let me tell you.

2558
02:43:29.68 --> 02:43:30.68
Let me tell you.

2559
02:43:30.68 --> 02:43:32.68
Do you get to will definitely help you in all aspects.

2560
02:43:32.68 --> 02:43:36.68
Let's think about this pragmatically confidence.

2561
02:43:36.68 --> 02:43:37.68
Yes.

2562
02:43:37.68 --> 02:43:39.68
If you know do you get to you will be more confident.

2563
02:43:39.68 --> 02:43:41.68
This is now you'll take a little.

2564
02:43:41.68 --> 02:43:44.68
You'll start off by taking a little bit step back in confidence.

2565
02:43:44.68 --> 02:43:49.68
Because when you very first start training you're going to be overwhelmed by the fact that you're going to be scared of everyone.

2566
02:43:49.68 --> 02:43:50.68
Looking at them going away.

2567
02:43:50.68 --> 02:43:52.68
This guy might know you're going to and then they can beat me.

2568
02:43:52.68 --> 02:43:54.68
But then after a little while you go, okay.

2569
02:43:54.68 --> 02:43:55.68
No cool.

2570
02:43:55.68 --> 02:43:57.68
Even if this person knows you're going to do it.

2571
02:43:57.68 --> 02:43:59.68
I at least know what to do a little bit.

2572
02:43:59.68 --> 02:44:00.68
Yes.

2573
02:44:00.68 --> 02:44:03.68
So confidence is definitely going to help you.

2574
02:44:03.68 --> 02:44:04.68
Stress relief.

2575
02:44:04.68 --> 02:44:05.68
We talked about that last time.

2576
02:44:05.68 --> 02:44:06.68
It's definitely going to help you.

2577
02:44:06.68 --> 02:44:09.68
Capability is definitely going to help you.

2578
02:44:09.68 --> 02:44:10.68
Yeah.

2579
02:44:10.68 --> 02:44:12.68
So it's going to help you across the board.

2580
02:44:12.68 --> 02:44:13.68
That's so much more.

2581
02:44:13.68 --> 02:44:14.68
Social aspects going to help you.

2582
02:44:14.68 --> 02:44:15.68
Okay.

2583
02:44:15.68 --> 02:44:16.68
Go ahead.

2584
02:44:16.68 --> 02:44:17.68
Sorry.

2585
02:44:17.68 --> 02:44:18.68
Back to doctor Thompson.

2586
02:44:18.68 --> 02:44:23.68
And you know all the sub guys were well actually a lot of guys that we've talked to.

2587
02:44:23.68 --> 02:44:24.68
Whatever.

2588
02:44:24.68 --> 02:44:30.68
I kind of trip out like when I go home in this in a lot of ways, but in this particular way where you know how like in the movies.

2589
02:44:30.68 --> 02:44:31.68
Right.

2590
02:44:31.68 --> 02:44:34.68
Where you got the guy and he's almost about to geek out.

2591
02:44:34.68 --> 02:44:35.68
Yeah.

2592
02:44:35.68 --> 02:44:36.68
Right.

2593
02:44:36.68 --> 02:44:40.68
But in the back of your mind you're like unless this movie is going to kill this character which they're not.

2594
02:44:40.68 --> 02:44:41.68
If it's the main character.

2595
02:44:41.68 --> 02:44:42.68
Right.

2596
02:44:42.68 --> 02:44:43.68
Unless it's way at the end and that's a different story.

2597
02:44:43.68 --> 02:44:45.68
But you know it's in the middle of the movie or whatever.

2598
02:44:45.68 --> 02:44:47.68
And he's about to get found out by the Mad guy.

2599
02:44:47.68 --> 02:44:49.68
Like it's going to get found and kill to whatever.

2600
02:44:49.68 --> 02:44:50.68
You're like okay.

2601
02:44:50.68 --> 02:44:52.68
This is good the way they present it and everything.

2602
02:44:52.68 --> 02:44:54.68
And I'm so it's suspenseful.

2603
02:44:54.68 --> 02:44:57.68
But the back of my mind like they're not going to kill this guy.

2604
02:44:57.68 --> 02:44:58.68
You know.

2605
02:44:58.68 --> 02:45:01.68
So you kind of get that feeling when they're telling this story.

2606
02:45:01.68 --> 02:45:03.68
But it's like a real story.

2607
02:45:03.68 --> 02:45:04.68
Yeah.

2608
02:45:04.68 --> 02:45:08.68
And that's why that's why you know when I was thinking about this like it's cool.

2609
02:45:08.68 --> 02:45:12.68
It's so awesome to sit here and talk to these guys that lived.

2610
02:45:12.68 --> 02:45:13.68
Yeah.

2611
02:45:13.68 --> 02:45:21.68
But you have to remember that there's countless guys that the exact scenario that these guys went through.

2612
02:45:21.68 --> 02:45:25.68
Where oh, the bullet went to inches to the left and set a two inch to the right.

2613
02:45:25.68 --> 02:45:26.68
And that guy's dead.

2614
02:45:26.68 --> 02:45:28.68
The helicopter got hit with this.

2615
02:45:28.68 --> 02:45:29.68
The helicopter crashed.

2616
02:45:29.68 --> 02:45:34.68
It's just it's that's why it's such a miracle that these guys are sitting here talking to us.

2617
02:45:34.68 --> 02:45:34.68
Yeah.

2618
02:45:34.68 --> 02:45:35.68
And that's what I mean.

2619
02:45:35.68 --> 02:45:38.68
Then that's why I'm actually tripping out because sure.

2620
02:45:38.68 --> 02:45:40.68
We know that guy lived because he's sitting right here.

2621
02:45:40.68 --> 02:45:47.68
We know that part of it, but when he takes you back to the moment, but we really don't know if this guy's going to live or not.

2622
02:45:47.68 --> 02:45:48.68
Yeah.

2623
02:45:48.68 --> 02:45:49.68
I mean, as far as myself.

2624
02:45:49.68 --> 02:45:53.68
And then at your body, even more, I kind of go down a little wormhole.

2625
02:45:53.68 --> 02:45:56.68
Like man, this is just how impossible this is not impossible.

2626
02:45:56.68 --> 02:45:59.68
Maybe that's not the right word, but it kind of feels like the right word.

2627
02:45:59.68 --> 02:46:06.68
But just how weird this is where let's say you went back in time and visited, you know,

2628
02:46:06.68 --> 02:46:11.68
tilt or whoever and say, hey, this is what you're going to do.

2629
02:46:11.68 --> 02:46:14.68
And these very specific things are going to happen.

2630
02:46:14.68 --> 02:46:16.68
And you're going to live.

2631
02:46:16.68 --> 02:46:21.68
Even him himself would be like, I don't know if that's possible.

2632
02:46:21.68 --> 02:46:22.68
Yeah, for sure.

2633
02:46:22.68 --> 02:46:24.68
Meanwhile, it's actually happened.

2634
02:46:24.68 --> 02:46:25.68
Yeah.

2635
02:46:25.68 --> 02:46:26.68
Man.

2636
02:46:26.68 --> 02:46:29.68
Yeah, it kind of puts a lot of things into perspective.

2637
02:46:29.68 --> 02:46:30.68
Yeah.

2638
02:46:30.68 --> 02:46:31.68
Yeah.

2639
02:46:31.68 --> 02:46:33.68
It's it's crazy.

2640
02:46:33.68 --> 02:46:37.68
Yeah.

2641
02:46:37.68 --> 02:46:38.68
Yeah.

2642
02:46:38.68 --> 02:46:47.68
And that story from Dick Thompson that I read today, just going into rescue with no plan, with no,

2643
02:46:47.68 --> 02:46:49.68
somebody else's weapon.

2644
02:46:49.68 --> 02:46:56.68
It's just like completely just dropping 15 feet into 150 foot of jungle canopy,

2645
02:46:56.68 --> 02:47:00.68
falling through the trees until you luckily hit a branch.

2646
02:47:00.68 --> 02:47:05.68
You know, by the way, if you hit the ground without hitting anything, you just die.

2647
02:47:05.68 --> 02:47:07.68
Straight up just die.

2648
02:47:07.68 --> 02:47:08.68
Yeah.

2649
02:47:08.68 --> 02:47:12.68
And so yeah, these guys are just, they're just awesome.

2650
02:47:12.68 --> 02:47:14.68
They're awesome human beings.

2651
02:47:14.68 --> 02:47:15.68
Yep.

2652
02:47:15.68 --> 02:47:16.68
Yeah.

2653
02:47:16.68 --> 02:47:19.68
And then you kind of, you sort of see them sitting across you when you're like,

2654
02:47:19.68 --> 02:47:20.68
can there's there is?

2655
02:47:20.68 --> 02:47:21.68
Yeah.

2656
02:47:21.68 --> 02:47:24.68
This is the guy you did that for real stuff, you know.

2657
02:47:24.68 --> 02:47:25.68
Yeah.

2658
02:47:25.68 --> 02:47:29.68
You know, what about those old pictures of tilt when tilt's like 20, 20, two years old?

2659
02:47:29.68 --> 02:47:30.68
Yeah.

2660
02:47:30.68 --> 02:47:31.68
You just look at those.

2661
02:47:31.68 --> 02:47:33.68
That's like the coolest guy ever.

2662
02:47:33.68 --> 02:47:39.68
And you see pictures of all these guys, the Frenchman with his, with his legs all taped up.

2663
02:47:39.68 --> 02:47:41.68
And you see Dick Thompson.

2664
02:47:41.68 --> 02:47:42.68
Dick Thompson was lucky.

2665
02:47:42.68 --> 02:47:43.68
Yeah.

2666
02:47:43.68 --> 02:47:45.68
Of was he a first lieutenant?

2667
02:47:45.68 --> 02:47:51.68
I thought it was cool on the first podcast when I was asking about how, like, when you volunteered,

2668
02:47:51.68 --> 02:47:52.68
was there any resistance?

2669
02:47:52.68 --> 02:47:55.68
He's like, no, he's volunteering to be an officer in Vietnam.

2670
02:47:55.68 --> 02:47:58.68
The life expectancy was a couple weeks.

2671
02:47:58.68 --> 02:48:01.68
They're like, oh, you want me an officer cool step right over here into this line.

2672
02:48:01.68 --> 02:48:03.68
Oh, you want to be going to range of schools, cool step into this line.

2673
02:48:03.68 --> 02:48:05.68
Oh, you want to be special forces cool step into this line.

2674
02:48:05.68 --> 02:48:07.68
Oh, you want to go to sag cool.

2675
02:48:07.68 --> 02:48:08.68
No problem step over here.

2676
02:48:08.68 --> 02:48:10.68
There's zero resistance.

2677
02:48:10.68 --> 02:48:17.68
Zero resistance for him to go and do what he wanted to do because the life expectancy of every one of those.

2678
02:48:17.68 --> 02:48:23.68
It's just like volunteer to volunteer to volunteer to, to be dead.

2679
02:48:23.68 --> 02:48:24.68
Yeah.

2680
02:48:24.68 --> 02:48:26.68
And there's no resistance.

2681
02:48:26.68 --> 02:48:29.68
So it's a minute.

2682
02:48:29.68 --> 02:48:30.68
Yeah.

2683
02:48:30.68 --> 02:48:31.68
It's crazy.

2684
02:48:31.68 --> 02:48:35.68
Well, very capable people were talking about here.

2685
02:48:35.68 --> 02:48:36.68
Yeah.

2686
02:48:36.68 --> 02:48:38.68
Mentally physically, mostly and spiritually.

2687
02:48:38.68 --> 02:48:39.68
100%.

2688
02:48:39.68 --> 02:48:41.68
Then last time to digit two.

2689
02:48:41.68 --> 02:48:46.68
Yes, covers all those things and we should be doing this in my opinion.

2690
02:48:46.68 --> 02:48:51.68
So we need G's when we do digit two because that's part of the uniform.

2691
02:48:51.68 --> 02:48:53.68
We get an origin gate.

2692
02:48:53.68 --> 02:48:56.68
Don't even have to ask that question.

2693
02:48:56.68 --> 02:48:57.68
No longer a question.

2694
02:48:57.68 --> 02:48:59.68
No longer a question.

2695
02:48:59.68 --> 02:49:02.68
Origin gate goes to originmain.com, boom, pick whatever you want.

2696
02:49:02.68 --> 02:49:03.68
Easy money.

2697
02:49:03.68 --> 02:49:07.68
Also, they also have rash guards on there.

2698
02:49:07.68 --> 02:49:08.68
Other clothing items.

2699
02:49:08.68 --> 02:49:09.68
Yeah.

2700
02:49:09.68 --> 02:49:15.68
Because you want to represent, you know, being in an American maid clothing.

2701
02:49:15.68 --> 02:49:19.68
But you can't wear your ghee to the store.

2702
02:49:19.68 --> 02:49:20.68
Unfortunately.

2703
02:49:20.68 --> 02:49:22.68
I mean, you could attack the American man.

2704
02:49:22.68 --> 02:49:26.68
You could technically, but usually the cut off for that are as around 11 years old.

2705
02:49:26.68 --> 02:49:27.68
Yes.

2706
02:49:27.68 --> 02:49:28.68
That's a sense.

2707
02:49:28.68 --> 02:49:31.68
Like my daughter, my little 10 year old daughter, she's walking around in a guy.

2708
02:49:31.68 --> 02:49:32.68
No fact.

2709
02:49:32.68 --> 02:49:32.68
No fact.

2710
02:49:32.68 --> 02:49:33.68
No.

2711
02:49:33.68 --> 02:49:34.68
No one says anything to her.

2712
02:49:34.68 --> 02:49:39.68
She's not like walking around trying to be proof that she's a jiu-jitsu player.

2713
02:49:39.68 --> 02:49:43.68
I mean, it's kind of evident that she's a jiu-jitsu player because she is wearing a ghee.

2714
02:49:43.68 --> 02:49:46.68
But, you know, it's no fact or she'll go to dinner with a ghee on.

2715
02:49:46.68 --> 02:49:48.68
You know what I mean?

2716
02:49:48.68 --> 02:49:50.68
Well, you know, okay.

2717
02:49:50.68 --> 02:49:51.68
All right.

2718
02:49:51.68 --> 02:49:53.68
You know, she's taking your glasses off.

2719
02:49:53.68 --> 02:49:54.68
I think her cut off is 11.

2720
02:49:54.68 --> 02:49:55.68
Yes.

2721
02:49:55.68 --> 02:49:58.68
When she turns 11, she'll probably be like, I'm going to take off my ghee right now.

2722
02:49:58.68 --> 02:50:02.68
Well, if you come straight from jiu-jitsu and you're like, hey, let's pick up some of your

2723
02:50:02.68 --> 02:50:03.68
cheese and you're hanging out.

2724
02:50:03.68 --> 02:50:05.68
She's not going, hey, we're going out for dinner.

2725
02:50:05.68 --> 02:50:07.68
If I let her go, let me put my ghee on.

2726
02:50:07.68 --> 02:50:08.68
No, she's not doing that.

2727
02:50:08.68 --> 02:50:10.68
I wouldn't be bothered if she did.

2728
02:50:10.68 --> 02:50:11.68
You know what I mean?

2729
02:50:11.68 --> 02:50:18.68
My son wore a dang, a dang Superman uniform for like two straight years when he was, you know,

2730
02:50:18.68 --> 02:50:20.68
five years old, five and six.

2731
02:50:20.68 --> 02:50:24.68
And you know, you know, when you're in a, a dang, uh, captain of America outfit, just walking around.

2732
02:50:24.68 --> 02:50:25.68
Just go to school with that.

2733
02:50:25.68 --> 02:50:27.68
It had the muscles in it, you know what I mean?

2734
02:50:27.68 --> 02:50:28.68
Oh, dang, walk through.

2735
02:50:28.68 --> 02:50:30.68
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're straight.

2736
02:50:30.68 --> 02:50:31.68
Calston, he's just walking around.

2737
02:50:31.68 --> 02:50:32.68
Yeah, whatever.

2738
02:50:32.68 --> 02:50:33.68
Gootman, I dig it.

2739
02:50:33.68 --> 02:50:39.68
And my other daughter wore a dang 22, you know, that is like a ballerina outfit, ballerina uniform.

2740
02:50:39.68 --> 02:50:41.68
And she was, you wore that thing all the time.

2741
02:50:41.68 --> 02:50:42.68
Just whatever.

2742
02:50:42.68 --> 02:50:43.68
Yeah.

2743
02:50:43.68 --> 02:50:44.68
She just know factor.

2744
02:50:44.68 --> 02:50:49.68
So what I'm saying is when you get past age 10, maybe 11, you don't want to wear.

2745
02:50:49.68 --> 02:50:53.68
You don't want to wear your G to the store to the restaurant.

2746
02:50:53.68 --> 02:50:54.68
Yeah.

2747
02:50:54.68 --> 02:50:59.68
But you still in your heart, you want to represent your good because we got to origin jeans.

2748
02:50:59.68 --> 02:51:01.68
You got the origin jeans.

2749
02:51:01.68 --> 02:51:05.68
You can get the regular weight jeans.

2750
02:51:05.68 --> 02:51:12.68
Or you can get the Delta 68 jeans, which are, I guess they're the Jocco signature model.

2751
02:51:12.68 --> 02:51:14.68
Yeah, maybe, but if they're thinner, right?

2752
02:51:14.68 --> 02:51:17.68
Yeah, thinner, well, technically isn't that a fashion thing.

2753
02:51:17.68 --> 02:51:20.68
I'm not saying this particular thing is the fashion thing.

2754
02:51:20.68 --> 02:51:24.68
I'm saying being thinner, fashion jeans tend to be thinner.

2755
02:51:24.68 --> 02:51:26.68
Okay, well, I don't know about that.

2756
02:51:26.68 --> 02:51:29.68
What I do know is this, I live in California.

2757
02:51:29.68 --> 02:51:31.68
It's warmer here.

2758
02:51:31.68 --> 02:51:34.68
We don't always need to wear thicker jeans.

2759
02:51:34.68 --> 02:51:36.68
So we get jeans, et cetera.

2760
02:51:36.68 --> 02:51:41.68
Light weight, just like when you're in the military, which you weren't, so you wouldn't know anything about,

2761
02:51:41.68 --> 02:51:44.68
about field camis, about how they used to have woodland camis.

2762
02:51:44.68 --> 02:51:46.68
They had a lightweight man, a heavy weight.

2763
02:51:46.68 --> 02:51:48.68
You don't know about that.

2764
02:51:48.68 --> 02:51:49.68
So I do.

2765
02:51:49.68 --> 02:51:50.68
Yes, I do.

2766
02:51:50.68 --> 02:51:51.68
So guess what we have?

2767
02:51:51.68 --> 02:51:52.68
Light weight jeans.

2768
02:51:52.68 --> 02:51:54.68
And I'll say the other ones are medium.

2769
02:51:54.68 --> 02:51:57.68
The other jeans are just normal jeans.

2770
02:51:57.68 --> 02:51:58.68
Yeah.

2771
02:51:58.68 --> 02:52:07.68
The Delta 68 named after my forefathers and the seal teams that were jeans in the Maycon Delta 68.

2772
02:52:07.68 --> 02:52:08.68
For the year?

2773
02:52:08.68 --> 02:52:09.68
Yeah.

2774
02:52:09.68 --> 02:52:10.68
That's a good day.

2775
02:52:10.68 --> 02:52:12.68
Yeah, no Delta 68.

2776
02:52:12.68 --> 02:52:13.68
Yeah.

2777
02:52:13.68 --> 02:52:18.68
Yeah. So get the Delta 68 jeans if you need something that's a little bit lighter weight.

2778
02:52:18.68 --> 02:52:19.68
Not for fashion.

2779
02:52:19.68 --> 02:52:21.68
I guess if you're echo Charles, you can do it for fashion.

2780
02:52:21.68 --> 02:52:23.68
Or if you're a normal human.

2781
02:52:23.68 --> 02:52:25.68
Fashion too.

2782
02:52:25.68 --> 02:52:30.68
But potentially, we'll just say, look, you know Pete sprinkled some fashion in there.

2783
02:52:30.68 --> 02:52:31.68
You know that.

2784
02:52:31.68 --> 02:52:33.68
You've got to watch him like a hawk.

2785
02:52:33.68 --> 02:52:36.68
No, but there's no fashion on the Delta 68 jeans.

2786
02:52:36.68 --> 02:52:37.68
Are you sure about that?

2787
02:52:37.68 --> 02:52:38.68
Yeah, I'm positive.

2788
02:52:38.68 --> 02:52:39.68
All right.

2789
02:52:39.68 --> 02:52:41.68
Well, I'm going to wear the jeans.

2790
02:52:41.68 --> 02:52:43.68
My Delta 68 jeans.

2791
02:52:43.68 --> 02:52:47.68
If that ever happens, I'm going to make a evaluation report back.

2792
02:52:47.68 --> 02:52:54.68
But my hypothesis is that if Pete has anything to do with it, which incidentally he does, he sprinkled some fashion in there.

2793
02:52:54.68 --> 02:52:57.68
I got to watch that guy like a sniper.

2794
02:52:57.68 --> 02:53:00.68
Because he will constantly try and do it.

2795
02:53:00.68 --> 02:53:01.68
He's a better guy.

2796
02:53:01.68 --> 02:53:02.68
He's a better guy.

2797
02:53:02.68 --> 02:53:04.68
I'm surprised they're not bell bottoms.

2798
02:53:04.68 --> 02:53:05.68
Okay.

2799
02:53:05.68 --> 02:53:09.68
You're bringing them back.

2800
02:53:09.68 --> 02:53:11.68
Yeah, I dig it and you're correct.

2801
02:53:11.68 --> 02:53:12.68
You're not wrong.

2802
02:53:12.68 --> 02:53:13.68
You're right.

2803
02:53:13.68 --> 02:53:15.68
But you're like, you eat steak.

2804
02:53:15.68 --> 02:53:16.68
Right.

2805
02:53:16.68 --> 02:53:17.68
What do you put on your steak?

2806
02:53:17.68 --> 02:53:18.68
Steak.

2807
02:53:18.68 --> 02:53:19.68
Like what do you put on there?

2808
02:53:19.68 --> 02:53:20.68
You can salt them pepper on there.

2809
02:53:20.68 --> 02:53:21.68
Salt them pepper.

2810
02:53:21.68 --> 02:53:22.68
Salt them pepper.

2811
02:53:22.68 --> 02:53:25.68
So you don't put like a special seasoning.

2812
02:53:25.68 --> 02:53:26.68
They got their special rub.

2813
02:53:26.68 --> 02:53:27.68
Are you with that?

2814
02:53:27.68 --> 02:53:28.68
Or are you just like whatever?

2815
02:53:28.68 --> 02:53:30.68
Kind of like a little bit of pepper.

2816
02:53:30.68 --> 02:53:31.68
I'm not anti.

2817
02:53:31.68 --> 02:53:33.68
I'm not hating them, but I'm not.

2818
02:53:33.68 --> 02:53:34.68
It seems unnecessary to me.

2819
02:53:34.68 --> 02:53:35.68
Okay.

2820
02:53:35.68 --> 02:53:37.68
So here's the comparison that what Pete does with fashion.

2821
02:53:37.68 --> 02:53:40.68
What people could do with steak.

2822
02:53:40.68 --> 02:53:41.68
Okay.

2823
02:53:41.68 --> 02:53:44.68
Let's say you're the kind of person who was like salt and pepper.

2824
02:53:44.68 --> 02:53:45.68
That's my jam.

2825
02:53:45.68 --> 02:53:47.68
Don't touch my steak otherwise.

2826
02:53:47.68 --> 02:53:49.68
Medium or medium or whatever.

2827
02:53:49.68 --> 02:53:50.68
You like to cook.

2828
02:53:50.68 --> 02:53:51.68
Salt them pepper.

2829
02:53:51.68 --> 02:53:52.68
That's all.

2830
02:53:52.68 --> 02:53:53.68
You put your stupid rub.

2831
02:53:53.68 --> 02:53:54.68
You're seasoning on it.

2832
02:53:54.68 --> 02:53:55.68
You're messing up my whole steak.

2833
02:53:55.68 --> 02:53:56.68
Okay.

2834
02:53:56.68 --> 02:53:57.68
You know people are like that.

2835
02:53:57.68 --> 02:53:58.68
Yeah.

2836
02:53:58.68 --> 02:53:59.68
And I dig it.

2837
02:53:59.68 --> 02:54:00.68
Man, that's you think.

2838
02:54:00.68 --> 02:54:02.68
Pete is the kind guy will be like, hey, no problem.

2839
02:54:02.68 --> 02:54:03.68
I got you.

2840
02:54:03.68 --> 02:54:04.68
You've salt and pepper that's it.

2841
02:54:04.68 --> 02:54:08.68
But he knows confidently that if you put some of that special rub on there, you'll

2842
02:54:08.68 --> 02:54:09.68
like it.

2843
02:54:09.68 --> 02:54:10.68
Yeah.

2844
02:54:10.68 --> 02:54:11.68
Not it.

2845
02:54:11.68 --> 02:54:12.68
Yeah.

2846
02:54:12.68 --> 02:54:13.68
As far as you're concerned, you're like nope.

2847
02:54:13.68 --> 02:54:14.68
Don't touch it.

2848
02:54:14.68 --> 02:54:15.68
Yeah.

2849
02:54:15.68 --> 02:54:16.68
Yeah.

2850
02:54:16.68 --> 02:54:17.68
And then he'll be like, okay.

2851
02:54:17.68 --> 02:54:18.68
I got you.

2852
02:54:18.68 --> 02:54:19.68
You know, sneak it in there.

2853
02:54:19.68 --> 02:54:20.68
You're 100% accurate.

2854
02:54:20.68 --> 02:54:21.68
Yeah.

2855
02:54:21.68 --> 02:54:22.68
Yeah.

2856
02:54:22.68 --> 02:54:24.68
And there's been time for I've been like brawl.

2857
02:54:24.68 --> 02:54:25.68
He put your mouth on that side.

2858
02:54:25.68 --> 02:54:26.68
Yeah.

2859
02:54:26.68 --> 02:54:27.68
But I think, I think he's spray.

2860
02:54:27.68 --> 02:54:28.68
He sneaks it in there.

2861
02:54:28.68 --> 02:54:31.68
And then when you taste the steak, you're like,

2862
02:54:31.68 --> 02:54:33.68
Hey, Pete makes a great steak.

2863
02:54:33.68 --> 02:54:35.68
Not even realize he's snuck in the rub.

2864
02:54:35.68 --> 02:54:36.68
Yeah.

2865
02:54:36.68 --> 02:54:37.68
That's what he does with the fashion.

2866
02:54:37.68 --> 02:54:38.68
With you.

2867
02:54:38.68 --> 02:54:39.68
Dish.

2868
02:54:39.68 --> 02:54:40.68
I hope he doesn't hear this, which I know he will.

2869
02:54:40.68 --> 02:54:42.68
He's going to be like, he's going to get excited about it.

2870
02:54:42.68 --> 02:54:43.68
And think he can sneak in more.

2871
02:54:43.68 --> 02:54:44.68
Yeah.

2872
02:54:44.68 --> 02:54:45.68
You can't Pete.

2873
02:54:45.68 --> 02:54:46.68
I'm watching you.

2874
02:54:46.68 --> 02:54:47.68
Like a sniper.

2875
02:54:47.68 --> 02:54:48.68
I got eyes on bro.

2876
02:54:48.68 --> 02:54:49.68
So the jeans.

2877
02:54:49.68 --> 02:54:51.68
I say Pete, do what you do, bro.

2878
02:54:51.68 --> 02:54:52.68
Do it.

2879
02:54:52.68 --> 02:54:54.68
Just don't take it too far.

2880
02:54:54.68 --> 02:54:55.68
Yeah.

2881
02:54:55.68 --> 02:54:56.68
The jeans are good.

2882
02:54:56.68 --> 02:54:58.68
I like, and this is how I know about the jeans too.

2883
02:54:58.68 --> 02:55:02.68
Because when I put them on, it's like, okay, my wife is kind of critical.

2884
02:55:02.68 --> 02:55:04.68
She's from the Pacific Northwest.

2885
02:55:04.68 --> 02:55:05.68
My wife.

2886
02:55:05.68 --> 02:55:09.68
So she knows about just functional jeans for work and like all that stuff.

2887
02:55:09.68 --> 02:55:11.68
She's just, and but she's, you know, she's not like a child.

2888
02:55:11.68 --> 02:55:12.68
Yeah, you know, she's down.

2889
02:55:12.68 --> 02:55:14.68
She, and she gets it.

2890
02:55:14.68 --> 02:55:15.68
I'm speaking for her.

2891
02:55:15.68 --> 02:55:17.68
By the way, but she doesn't like it.

2892
02:55:17.68 --> 02:55:18.68
She doesn't like the look.

2893
02:55:18.68 --> 02:55:20.68
You reminds her, you know, those are dad jeans.

2894
02:55:20.68 --> 02:55:22.68
And, you know, my dad has a worker, whatever.

2895
02:55:22.68 --> 02:55:23.68
She doesn't like the look.

2896
02:55:23.68 --> 02:55:24.68
That's what I'm saying.

2897
02:55:24.68 --> 02:55:26.68
So I put on the origin jeans.

2898
02:55:26.68 --> 02:55:27.68
If she didn't like them, she would tell me.

2899
02:55:27.68 --> 02:55:28.68
100%.

2900
02:55:28.68 --> 02:55:34.68
She probably wouldn't even let me be seen with her, which I can respect on a certain level.

2901
02:55:34.68 --> 02:55:37.68
And she even said those jeans look good.

2902
02:55:37.68 --> 02:55:38.68
Interesting.

2903
02:55:38.68 --> 02:55:43.68
So the man approved in my household approved looks like a peat,

2904
02:55:43.68 --> 02:55:46.68
the lime and spice right for that goes deep.

2905
02:55:46.68 --> 02:55:47.68
Perfect.

2906
02:55:47.68 --> 02:55:50.68
Also, what else does origin have the assufflements?

2907
02:55:50.68 --> 02:55:51.68
Obviously.

2908
02:55:51.68 --> 02:55:54.68
Keep us on track in the game.

2909
02:55:54.68 --> 02:55:56.68
Even when you get older.

2910
02:55:56.68 --> 02:56:00.68
If you're old school, and you ask, am I too old to join you to?

2911
02:56:00.68 --> 02:56:01.68
Nope.

2912
02:56:01.68 --> 02:56:05.68
I was working with a tech company yesterday.

2913
02:56:05.68 --> 02:56:07.68
And they were talking about age.

2914
02:56:07.68 --> 02:56:09.68
And everyone there was young.

2915
02:56:09.68 --> 02:56:12.68
And they were like, say, no, no, there's some older people here.

2916
02:56:12.68 --> 02:56:13.68
Like late 40s.

2917
02:56:13.68 --> 02:56:15.68
And I'm like, hey, how's it going?

2918
02:56:15.68 --> 02:56:16.68
Hey, pretty funny.

2919
02:56:16.68 --> 02:56:19.68
But yes, here's the thing.

2920
02:56:19.68 --> 02:56:22.68
One thing that can help you is these supplements during

2921
02:56:22.68 --> 02:56:26.68
Warfare Curl Oil, Discipline, Discipline Go.

2922
02:56:26.68 --> 02:56:28.68
They are definitely beneficial.

2923
02:56:28.68 --> 02:56:34.68
If you think you might forget, first of all, take more discipline.

2924
02:56:34.68 --> 02:56:35.68
But second of all, subscribe.

2925
02:56:35.68 --> 02:56:38.68
You can do the subscription thing on originmain.com.

2926
02:56:38.68 --> 02:56:39.68
And then you just get.

2927
02:56:39.68 --> 02:56:40.68
It just shows up.

2928
02:56:40.68 --> 02:56:43.68
Just just make it a standard operating procedure.

2929
02:56:43.68 --> 02:56:44.68
Done.

2930
02:56:44.68 --> 02:56:45.68
Then you don't fall off.

2931
02:56:45.68 --> 02:56:48.68
You know how long I've gone without joint Warfare for?

2932
02:56:48.68 --> 02:56:49.68
Never.

2933
02:56:49.68 --> 02:56:51.68
I take it every day.

2934
02:56:51.68 --> 02:56:52.68
You know, I take it every day.

2935
02:56:52.68 --> 02:56:53.68
Yes.

2936
02:56:53.68 --> 02:56:54.68
You're saying with cruel oil.

2937
02:56:54.68 --> 02:56:55.68
You mentioned forgetting.

2938
02:56:55.68 --> 02:57:00.68
So, you know, how like you, when I forget to take it, like you kind of look at me crazy.

2939
02:57:00.68 --> 02:57:01.68
Like proud.

2940
02:57:01.68 --> 02:57:03.68
Like how do you forget you just started out with it?

2941
02:57:03.68 --> 02:57:05.68
Yeah, it's not hard to find a true paste.

2942
02:57:05.68 --> 02:57:08.68
Or one might argue, oh, it's not important to you.

2943
02:57:08.68 --> 02:57:09.68
Right.

2944
02:57:09.68 --> 02:57:12.68
But it's not really true because if you're in a certain routine,

2945
02:57:12.68 --> 02:57:16.68
and this goes to your point where if you don't roll that into your routine,

2946
02:57:16.68 --> 02:57:18.68
you will forget even if it's important.

2947
02:57:18.68 --> 02:57:20.68
Because there's certain times of the day or certain times of moments in life.

2948
02:57:20.68 --> 02:57:23.68
Whatever you do, like Brad, you know when you're driving, right?

2949
02:57:23.68 --> 02:57:27.68
When you're driving home, Brad, you'll forget the whole experience of driving home.

2950
02:57:27.68 --> 02:57:30.68
Because you're thinking of the stuff, like routinely or whatever, and you're like,

2951
02:57:30.68 --> 02:57:31.68
oh, shoot.

2952
02:57:31.68 --> 02:57:33.68
I don't remember one single moment of driving home really.

2953
02:57:33.68 --> 02:57:34.68
You just did it automatically.

2954
02:57:34.68 --> 02:57:35.68
You lived.

2955
02:57:35.68 --> 02:57:36.68
You lived.

2956
02:57:36.68 --> 02:57:37.68
Yes.

2957
02:57:37.68 --> 02:57:37.68
What?

2958
02:57:37.68 --> 02:57:38.68
Living's not important?

2959
02:57:38.68 --> 02:57:39.68
Well, go.

2960
02:57:39.68 --> 02:57:40.68
Driving home's not important.

2961
02:57:40.68 --> 02:57:40.68
Yeah.

2962
02:57:40.68 --> 02:57:42.68
It's very important, but it's just so routine.

2963
02:57:42.68 --> 02:57:43.68
Same thing.

2964
02:57:43.68 --> 02:57:48.68
So like I said, if taking the cruel oil or joint joint warfare is not rolled into your routine,

2965
02:57:48.68 --> 02:57:50.68
you can potentially forget it.

2966
02:57:50.68 --> 02:57:52.68
So roll it into your routine.

2967
02:57:52.68 --> 02:57:53.68
Subscribe.

2968
02:57:53.68 --> 02:57:57.68
And you actually save money if you subscribe to.

2969
02:57:57.68 --> 02:57:58.68
So do that.

2970
02:57:58.68 --> 02:58:02.68
Don't forget about the ready to drink cans.

2971
02:58:02.68 --> 02:58:05.68
You don't need to drink these hyped up,

2972
02:58:05.68 --> 02:58:07.68
energy drinks anymore.

2973
02:58:07.68 --> 02:58:09.68
That are literally not good for you.

2974
02:58:09.68 --> 02:58:11.68
You can now drink something that is good for you.

2975
02:58:11.68 --> 02:58:13.68
Taste delicious.

2976
02:58:13.68 --> 02:58:14.68
Give you a little.

2977
02:58:14.68 --> 02:58:19.68
Get you.

2978
02:58:19.68 --> 02:58:22.68
It's a milder taste to than the energy drinks.

2979
02:58:22.68 --> 02:58:28.68
So what it kind of allows you, I mean, I'm assuming this is why it allows you to drink like more of them.

2980
02:58:28.68 --> 02:58:30.68
Be careful with it.

2981
02:58:30.68 --> 02:58:33.68
I'm saying, but you know the kind where you drink two of the,

2982
02:58:33.68 --> 02:58:36.68
we'll say for lack of a better term, traditional energy drinks.

2983
02:58:36.68 --> 02:58:37.68
You drink two of those.

2984
02:58:37.68 --> 02:58:38.68
You don't feel good afterwards.

2985
02:58:38.68 --> 02:58:39.68
No, you feel like crap.

2986
02:58:39.68 --> 02:58:41.68
Even if you're into energy drinks, typically.

2987
02:58:41.68 --> 02:58:42.68
Yeah, you kind of feel junk.

2988
02:58:42.68 --> 02:58:43.68
Those are just like, man,

2989
02:58:43.68 --> 02:58:45.68
you can kind of have one going.

2990
02:58:45.68 --> 02:58:46.68
Yep.

2991
02:58:46.68 --> 02:58:47.68
Kind of.

2992
02:58:47.68 --> 02:58:49.68
Yeah, so yeah, so you can end up getting about milk.

2993
02:58:49.68 --> 02:58:52.68
All different kinds of protein desserts.

2994
02:58:52.68 --> 02:58:55.68
Just straight desserts for you for your warrior kid,

2995
02:58:55.68 --> 02:58:57.68
milk for your kids, get some of that.

2996
02:58:57.68 --> 02:59:02.68
And then we got the white tea going to get you through the winter months with the warm white tea.

2997
02:59:02.68 --> 02:59:04.68
It get the canned white tea.

2998
02:59:04.68 --> 02:59:07.68
And of course the benefit is 8,000 pound.

2999
02:59:07.68 --> 02:59:09.68
I left a post already know that.

3000
02:59:09.68 --> 02:59:09.68
Yep.

3001
02:59:09.68 --> 02:59:12.68
Also speaking of benefits.

3002
02:59:12.68 --> 02:59:13.68
Kind of.

3003
02:59:13.68 --> 02:59:14.68
Chocolate store.

3004
02:59:14.68 --> 02:59:15.68
It's called the Uncle Store.

3005
02:59:15.68 --> 02:59:17.68
That's where you can get shirts.

3006
02:59:17.68 --> 02:59:18.68
Why is that beneficial?

3007
02:59:18.68 --> 02:59:20.68
Because it's speaking of benefits.

3008
02:59:20.68 --> 02:59:21.68
No.

3009
02:59:21.68 --> 02:59:22.68
Not presenting.

3010
02:59:22.68 --> 02:59:26.68
I thought what you were going to say is there's a guy that said his wife said to him,

3011
02:59:26.68 --> 02:59:28.68
what do you want for your birthday?

3012
02:59:28.68 --> 02:59:30.68
And he said there's a store.

3013
02:59:30.68 --> 02:59:32.68
It's called the store.

3014
02:59:32.68 --> 02:59:34.68
And she was like,

3015
02:59:34.68 --> 02:59:35.68
Yeah.

3016
02:59:35.68 --> 02:59:37.68
In my mind, she said,

3017
02:59:37.68 --> 02:59:39.68
She probably didn't.

3018
02:59:39.68 --> 02:59:40.68
She probably said, okay, what's that?

3019
02:59:40.68 --> 02:59:42.68
Yeah, let me go and look into it.

3020
02:59:42.68 --> 02:59:43.68
And you can get shirts.

3021
02:59:43.68 --> 02:59:44.68
It is beneficial.

3022
02:59:44.68 --> 02:59:50.68
Because especially nowadays, like you can get, right, you can, I think nowadays, I don't

3023
02:59:50.68 --> 02:59:55.68
say the word fashion necessarily.

3024
02:59:55.68 --> 02:59:58.68
I'm saying, but what you wear as well.

3025
02:59:58.68 --> 03:00:03.68
You know what you wear.

3026
03:00:03.68 --> 03:00:05.68
We're going to shut down the store.

3027
03:00:05.68 --> 03:00:09.68
The way you wear it's not a fashion store.

3028
03:00:09.68 --> 03:00:12.68
It's not.

3029
03:00:12.68 --> 03:00:16.68
But what you wear is like, you have many options.

3030
03:00:16.68 --> 03:00:17.68
Right.

3031
03:00:17.68 --> 03:00:18.68
Like in life.

3032
03:00:18.68 --> 03:00:21.68
I'm saying, you can wear just a blank shirt if you want.

3033
03:00:21.68 --> 03:00:22.68
You know.

3034
03:00:22.68 --> 03:00:25.68
So you kind of look for a little bit more than just the,

3035
03:00:25.68 --> 03:00:27.68
Well, I guess you kind of look for a lot of things.

3036
03:00:27.68 --> 03:00:31.68
Anyway, one of the things that this, as far as this stuff that you can get,

3037
03:00:31.68 --> 03:00:34.68
it kind of is representative of a certain,

3038
03:00:34.68 --> 03:00:41.68
you know, should I say, not message, but a certain discourse.

3039
03:00:41.68 --> 03:00:42.68
Okay.

3040
03:00:42.68 --> 03:00:42.68
Yeah.

3041
03:00:42.68 --> 03:00:46.68
So anyways, what you can get is t shirts, rash guards, hats,

3042
03:00:46.68 --> 03:00:48.68
sweatshirts, but not t shirts.

3043
03:00:48.68 --> 03:00:49.68
But not t shirts.

3044
03:00:49.68 --> 03:00:50.68
I just need t shirts though.

3045
03:00:50.68 --> 03:00:51.68
Yeah.

3046
03:00:51.68 --> 03:00:52.68
So what I'm saying.

3047
03:00:52.68 --> 03:00:53.68
Good quality ones.

3048
03:00:53.68 --> 03:00:54.68
Good quality ones.

3049
03:00:54.68 --> 03:00:55.68
You are 100% yes, given.

3050
03:00:55.68 --> 03:01:01.68
But, you know, there's a little added layer to what you're wearing.

3051
03:01:01.68 --> 03:01:06.68
Is there a placebo effect when you wear a shirt that says this one equals freedom?

3052
03:01:06.68 --> 03:01:07.68
Yes.

3053
03:01:07.68 --> 03:01:09.68
Does it affect your mentality?

3054
03:01:09.68 --> 03:01:10.68
Technically yes.

3055
03:01:10.68 --> 03:01:14.68
It is, it is, I guess, technically a placebo effect.

3056
03:01:14.68 --> 03:01:15.68
But that's how, right?

3057
03:01:15.68 --> 03:01:17.68
Or is it just a real effect?

3058
03:01:17.68 --> 03:01:18.68
It's a real effect.

3059
03:01:18.68 --> 03:01:19.68
Well, placebo effect is a real effect.

3060
03:01:19.68 --> 03:01:20.68
Yeah.

3061
03:01:20.68 --> 03:01:24.68
It's kind of like, um, like hypnosis or something like this.

3062
03:01:24.68 --> 03:01:25.68
Yeah.

3063
03:01:25.68 --> 03:01:26.68
Right.

3064
03:01:26.68 --> 03:01:27.68
That's a real effect too.

3065
03:01:27.68 --> 03:01:28.68
Most of the time sometimes it's just a show.

3066
03:01:28.68 --> 03:01:31.68
But the effect, the result is real.

3067
03:01:31.68 --> 03:01:32.68
Yeah.

3068
03:01:32.68 --> 03:01:35.68
That's where we get the 19% increased risk.

3069
03:01:35.68 --> 03:01:37.68
Strength and performance.

3070
03:01:37.68 --> 03:01:39.68
We can recommend to the security.

3071
03:01:39.68 --> 03:01:40.68
Yes.

3072
03:01:40.68 --> 03:01:42.68
With the rashguard with the t shirts.

3073
03:01:42.68 --> 03:01:42.68
Yeah.

3074
03:01:42.68 --> 03:01:44.68
Actually we're up to 22% now.

3075
03:01:44.68 --> 03:01:45.68
Okay.

3076
03:01:45.68 --> 03:01:45.68
Yeah.

3077
03:01:45.68 --> 03:01:46.68
That happened last year.

3078
03:01:46.68 --> 03:01:47.68
Late last year.

3079
03:01:47.68 --> 03:01:48.68
And yeah.

3080
03:01:48.68 --> 03:01:49.68
Up 22% improved everything.

3081
03:01:49.68 --> 03:01:53.68
Mental, physical and spiritual and social.

3082
03:01:53.68 --> 03:01:54.68
By the way.

3083
03:01:54.68 --> 03:01:55.68

03:02:25.68 --> 03:02:26.68

03:02:26.68 --> 03:02:32.68
You can also check out the grounded podcast, which is a different podcast that we do.

3098
03:02:32.68 --> 03:02:33.68
It's called grounded.

3099
03:02:33.68 --> 03:02:34.68
Yes.

3100
03:02:34.68 --> 03:02:35.68
We talk about.

3101
03:02:35.68 --> 03:02:42.68
Gejitsu, life, experience, humor and other things.

3102
03:02:42.68 --> 03:02:43.68
And other things.

3103
03:02:43.68 --> 03:02:47.68
And here's a, here's a bit, like, get it back me up on other things.

3104
03:02:47.68 --> 03:02:48.68
It's true.

3105
03:02:48.68 --> 03:02:49.68
It's true.

3106
03:02:49.68 --> 03:02:54.68
Because there are some elements of that that I did notice that, you know,

3107
03:02:54.68 --> 03:02:56.68
there's like issues, not necessarily controversial.

3108
03:02:56.68 --> 03:02:58.68
You're like, type on the grounded podcast.

3109
03:02:58.68 --> 03:03:00.68
Yes, because I think it's because you kind of, like,

3110
03:03:00.68 --> 03:03:02.68
feel like you're a little bit of the star of the ground.

3111
03:03:02.68 --> 03:03:04.68
No, I don't feel like I'm a star at all.

3112
03:03:04.68 --> 03:03:08.68
Actually, I feel like a bit that you will allow me,

3113
03:03:08.68 --> 03:03:12.68
maybe not anymore, but you will allow me to introduce elements to it.

3114
03:03:12.68 --> 03:03:14.68
That kind of have two sides to it, you know,

3115
03:03:14.68 --> 03:03:18.68
and then I can, you can kind of see, okay, where does people, where do people fall on this

3116
03:03:18.68 --> 03:03:19.68
issue?

3117
03:03:19.68 --> 03:03:20.68
Not a poor issue.

3118
03:03:20.68 --> 03:03:22.68
By the way, but.

3119
03:03:22.68 --> 03:03:25.68
So yes, I am, would you say, hyped?

3120
03:03:25.68 --> 03:03:26.68
You're hyped.

3121
03:03:26.68 --> 03:03:28.68
Yeah, I guess, I guess, I guess.

3122
03:03:28.68 --> 03:03:32.68

No, anyway, how about this?

3125
03:03:38.68 --> 03:03:41.68
Let's just say, I highly recommend that one.

3126
03:03:41.68 --> 03:03:42.68

3190
03:06:32.68 --> 03:06:35.68

3191
03:06:35.68 --> 03:06:36.68
I need it to order the book.

I wish I had when I was a kid.

3198
03:06:56.68 --> 03:07:00.68
And if I promised you when you read it, you're saying, I wish I would have had this book.

3199
03:07:00.68 --> 03:07:04.68
And I said, you might even be in a full on adult and say, I wish I learned these lessons.

3200
03:07:04.68 --> 03:07:09.68
Way the warrior kid won, way the warrior kid two marks mission and way the warrior kid three,

3201
03:07:09.68 --> 03:07:11.68
where there's a will.

3202
03:07:11.68 --> 03:07:12.68
So check those out.

3203
03:07:12.68 --> 03:07:17.68
If you've got a little kid in your life somewhere, a little bit younger, maybe six years old,

3204
03:07:17.68 --> 03:07:21.68
five years old, seven years old, three years old, get a mickey in the dragons.

3205
03:07:21.68 --> 03:07:25.68
They're actually going to learn a pragmatic technique to overcome fear.

3206
03:07:25.68 --> 03:07:29.68
Which if you remember being a little kid, life is filled with fear.

3207
03:07:29.68 --> 03:07:31.68
So how do you overcome that?

3208
03:07:31.68 --> 03:07:32.68
You get mickey in the dragons.

3209
03:07:32.68 --> 03:07:33.68
That's what you do.

3210
03:07:33.68 --> 03:07:35.68
Discipline equals freedom field manual.

3211
03:07:35.68 --> 03:07:37.68
There's the Christmas present.

3212
03:07:37.68 --> 03:07:43.68
There's the Christmas present you want to get for someone that may be drifted off the path.

3213
03:07:43.68 --> 03:07:45.68
Maybe they're having a hard time.

3214
03:07:45.68 --> 03:07:46.68
Maybe life isn't going good.

3215
03:07:46.68 --> 03:07:48.68
Maybe they could do better.

3216
03:07:48.68 --> 03:07:51.68
Maybe you know that discipline would help them in their life.

3217
03:07:51.68 --> 03:07:54.68
Get them the discipline equals freedom field manual.

3218
03:07:54.68 --> 03:07:55.68
Simple as that.

3219
03:07:55.68 --> 03:07:58.68
And then for leadership, we got extreme ownership.

3220
03:07:58.68 --> 03:08:00.68
We got dichotomy of leadership.

3221
03:08:00.68 --> 03:08:02.68
I wrote those with my brother, Dave Babin.

3222
03:08:02.68 --> 03:08:03.68
He's about what we learn.

3223
03:08:03.68 --> 03:08:10.68
I'm a battlefield and how you can apply it to your life, to win, to your business, to win, to your company, to win.

3224
03:08:10.68 --> 03:08:12.68
I also have a leadership consultancy.

3225
03:08:12.68 --> 03:08:15.68
It's called echelon front.

3226
03:08:15.68 --> 03:08:19.68
And what we do is we solve problems through leadership.

3227
03:08:19.68 --> 03:08:21.68
That is what we do.

3228
03:08:21.68 --> 03:08:24.68
So go to echelon front dot com for details.

3229
03:08:24.68 --> 03:08:28.68
If you want to have someone from the team, come and speak at your company.

3230
03:08:28.68 --> 03:08:31.68
Don't go to a speaker's bureau.

3231
03:08:31.68 --> 03:08:33.68
No, you go to echelon front dot com.

3232
03:08:33.68 --> 03:08:36.68
You cut out the middle man and you go right to the company.

3233
03:08:36.68 --> 03:08:37.68
That's what we do.

3234
03:08:37.68 --> 03:08:41.68
You don't need to Google, jaco speaker.

3235
03:08:41.68 --> 03:08:42.68
Because you're going to get somewhere.

3236
03:08:42.68 --> 03:08:43.68
You'll see echelon front.

3237
03:08:43.68 --> 03:08:44.68
You won't know what it is.

3238
03:08:44.68 --> 03:08:46.68
Maybe you go to click on someone else.

3239
03:08:46.68 --> 03:08:50.68
And then they charge you a big chunk of money on top of what I'm going to charge.

3240
03:08:50.68 --> 03:08:51.68
Don't do that.

3241
03:08:51.68 --> 03:08:54.68
Go to echelon front dot com.

3242
03:08:54.68 --> 03:08:57.68
We also have online training.

3243
03:08:57.68 --> 03:08:59.68
Because leadership training is not an accumulation.

3244
03:08:59.68 --> 03:09:01.68
You don't get one shot.

3245
03:09:01.68 --> 03:09:02.68
And now you're good to go.

3246
03:09:02.68 --> 03:09:03.68
No, it takes time.

3247
03:09:03.68 --> 03:09:05.68
It takes reps.

3248
03:09:05.68 --> 03:09:06.68
Get the reps in.

3249
03:09:06.68 --> 03:09:07.68
See you again.

3250
03:09:07.68 --> 03:09:08.68
See you from a different angle.

Our placement platforms where you're taking military personnel and putting them into civilian organizations.

3262
03:09:37.68 --> 03:09:41.68
So that they can help those organizations lead at every level and win.

3263
03:09:41.68 --> 03:09:44.68
Go to EF overwatch dot com or EF Legion dot com.

3264

That is what you need.

3265
03:09:46.68 --> 03:09:47.68
Is leadership.

3266
03:09:47.68 --> 03:09:49.68
And if you.

3267
03:09:49.68 --> 03:09:51.68

3270
03:09:56.68 --> 03:10:03.68

We thank him for his incredible service and sacrifice to our great nation.

3282
03:10:40.68 --> 03:10:46.68
And that goes to all the rest of our service men and women who stand the watch against evil.

3283
03:10:46.68 --> 03:10:49.68
And against tyranny so that we can be here.

03:10:49.68 --> 03:10:51.68
Living in freedom.

3285
03:10:51.68 --> 03:11:01.68

3287
03:11:06.68 --> 03:11:12.68
All you that are out there risking your lives for us.

3288
03:11:12.68 --> 03:11:20.68
Thank you for standing the watch over us here at home so we can sleep safely at night.

3289
03:11:20.68 --> 03:11:26.68
And everyone else out there ask yourself that question.

3290
03:11:26.68 --> 03:11:31.68
What are you capable of being?

3291
03:11:31.68 --> 03:11:33.68
What are you capable of being?

3292
03:11:33.68 --> 03:11:43.68
And are you doing everything in your power to be the most capable human being you can be?

3293
03:11:43.68 --> 03:11:46.68
I know when I ask myself that question.

3294
03:11:46.68 --> 03:11:50.68
I know the answer I know I can do more.

3295
03:11:50.68 --> 03:11:51.68
I know I can't.

3296
03:11:51.68 --> 03:11:55.68
We can all do more.

3297
03:11:55.68 --> 03:12:02.68
And that starts each every day by getting up.

3298
03:12:02.68 --> 03:12:08.68
Going on the attack and getting after it.

3299
03:12:08.68 --> 03:12:17.68
And until next time this is echo and jocco out.
