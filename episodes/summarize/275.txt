but and west was gone he'd forgotten to put gloves on and his hands were paying for that mistake how am I going to get him out he said more to himself than anyone particular jameson you keep an eye on him and keep him covered captain boa shamp said to the door gunner dropping the 70 feet or so west sprinted to the pilot who is still unconscious and hanging in the tree only a few feet off the ground small tuffs of graft grass and dirt were being kicked up around west as small arms fire was directed in his direction damn parachute release won't release son of a bitch dammit come on west screamed hoping the pilot would wake and give him some assistance he did not got to get a knife pausing at a low crouch west waited a moment before he sprinted back to the aircraft which was still at a hover engaging the NVA position as he ran west made a cutting motion hoping the gunner or copilot would recognize the signal and drop a knife they did picking up the knife west didn't hesitate to sprint back to the hanging pilot cut him free and throw him over his shoulder just then an RPG round slammed into the tree the pilot had been hanging in with the pilot over his shoulder in a fireman carry position west ran for the aircraft and the dangling rope grabbing the rope he wrapped it around the pilot and himself and motion for the aircraft to take off west didn't have time to tie a knot but only had the rope wrapped around himself on the pilot because of his rope burned hands west couldn't climb the rope but prayed he could hold on long enough to get safely back to ground as the aircraft climbed out and built up some speed small arms fire continued captain boa shamp didn't fly couldn't fly with any speed as the drag on west in the pilot would be too great and pull them off the rope west was dangling about 70 feet below the aircraft which was flying over the jungle at two to 300 feet helicopter crews did not have parachutes as west cleared the trees captain boa shamp nose the aircraft over and began picking up speed all the wild praying west didn't fall everyone was well aware that if they had the an engine failure or any other emergency west in the pilot wouldn't survive arriving over a clearing captain boa shamp captain boa shamp lowered the aircraft to place west and the pilot on the ground and then the aircraft this was an unscured clearing only about 1500 meters from where they picked up the pilot detaching the rope west and jamison quickly loaded the pilot into the aircraft and departed for LZ Center where the unconscious pilot was quickly transferred to a meta-vac aircraft that had been requested west resumed his duties as crew chief west went on to receive it was put in for the metal of honor it was downgraded to the Stinger service cross and he spent 20 years in the army retired as a command sergeant major at the fort used as Virginia yeah picking it up here I was in the chalk to position and it just cleared the trees and was really paying no attention to chalk three who attempted to fly between two trees and caught a rotor blade on one yeah to everyone's hard the aircraft slowly rolled to the right where the damage rotor blade made contact with the ground when it did the rotor blades began to disintegrate with pieces flying everywhere soldiers in the back began falling out of the aircraft and they were fortunate and they were the fortunate ones as the aircraft was now descending toward the ground as the right side impacted the transmission was ripped from its mounts and tore through the cargo compartment as the aircraft came to stop the engine was still running now whatever increasing RPM as there was no rotor to turn or transmission connected fuel began to spill across the engine at this time the aircraft aircraft were not equipped with self-sealing fuel cells that would prevent a major fire the aircraft began to burn and burn rapidly as Bill had been waiting for chalk three and forward to take off he was only he was only light on his skids when the accident happened his crew chief door door gunner and captain head immediately jumped out and ran to pull people out of the aircraft soldiers on the ground also moved forward to assist lightning and that was a call sign of one of the guys was attempting to climb out but was days to and having difficulty moving quickly to assist lightning captain head was having difficulty as well as the fire was now in the cockpit and spreading rapidly the copilot was consumed in the flames as was the crew chief the gunner could not be seen as he was under the aircraft having occupied the right side of the aircraft that day finally lightning was extracted from the wreckage and fire Yes, they changed the policy because we're just we're so short of officers of We didn't have any experienced officers That were ready to take over flight lead position so the company commander he went to the brigade commander and say hey We got to start letting the experienced warrants, you know, he said I got I got two warrants that are over Over 12 months in the unit and these guys know what they're doing you got to you got to open the policy up in the brigade commander Colonel suit check really a good guy We were now on the ground with the grunts Peters was on his M60 machine gun and I told him to get down no need for him to sit in the gunners position and be a target to his credit He did and took his gun with him dragging ammo as well Specialist love lace was doing the same the code was were coming in around for a second pass and using the remaining rockets and 40 millimeter ammo That they had rattle or six was on the ground next to me and began calling for artillery support as the second flight crew Flight came into view the artillery silence and the anti aircraft gun that had worked us over as well as the small arms fire That was coming from the trees We remained in the LZ until the third lift and jumped on an aircraft to get out Already the battalion commander notified brigade that an aircraft was down in the LZ a recovery team was getting ready to come and get the aircraft and fly it Fly it back under our CH 47 a new engine would be installed that night and that aircraft would be flying in the morning hopefully Flying back love lace turned to me damn Mr. Corey your psychic with your feelings You just you you fly the normal missions just now you got really new guys flying with your right seat On May 4th 1969 two aircraft from our sister company company be joined information with the second aircraft in a right echelon To the first the second aircraft attempted to pass the first aircraft on his right side There was a miscommunication between the two aircraft resulting in a mid air collision all crew members on both aircraft were killed you know you mostly but right books about uh leadership so you know what what's this thing over here they're not gonna print enough they're not gonna print enough and then it'll come out you'll be mad because you got the third of the dish brutal shame just shame uh leadership strategy and tactics field manual the code the evaluation of protocols discipline equals freedom field manual way the warrior kid one two three and four mic in the dragons about face this is getting to be a long list this is just an in the the original books extreme ownership and the dichotomy of leadership that I wrote with my brother Dave Babin also we have echelon front which is our leadership consulting company we saw problems through leadership kota echelon front dot com if you want us to help inside your company we have eF online which is online training for leadership you can get your whole organization into the game go to eF online dot com for that muster our leadership events we are executing we didn't execute in 2020 there was the virus and whatnot we were about to execute one in 2020 and guess what happened I got the virus I got I had had had messroona and so when I had messroona I couldn't go spread it to everybody one per guy made it's officer two and later flight leaders he said gentlemen I can't tell you where we're going but we got a big lift tomorrow and the maintenance officer I've been real stingy about letting us take an aircraft and he turned to the maintenance officer is what's available at your mart made in substance sir we got 21 out of 21 he says good they turned to to me and he says you're chalked two tomorrow if I go down you take the flight in I'm thinking what the hell you turned to Reynolds and he says if Corey goes down you take the flight in okay sir he says now I want you to get everyone of your pilots and your crew chiefs up so we read that and I said you know Billy if they go into Kuwait we're gonna go to war and I think it was two weeks later it was in the Wall Street jobs in the New York Times and two weeks later he got the call and I turned to Billy I says let's get out of here so right away we got the West Point staff we planned out what we had to get done that week and to get out of there so when we got the call on a Friday night to get out of West Point we were gone the next morning and got back to Campbell had three weeks back at Campbell before we'd shipped out to to Iraq or out to Saudi Arabia well if Sedan had attacked we in the 80s second would have been speed bumps and thank God he didn't attack but we went up and sat about 60 miles from the border and we had a defensive position set up there and that's what we sat from August to February January to January Oh, they were in there all the time On May 1st 1970 at 07 10 hours company C 227 AHB inserted an Arvan airborne rifle company to secure landing zone just across the border inside Cambodia once the landing zone was secured 605 105 millimeter howitzers and three 155 millimeter howitzers which would support additional insertions throughout the area of operations were brought in by CH 47 helicopters later that day the second battalion 7th cavalry was inserted into landing zone X Ray marking the first American ground troops from the first cavalry division to enter Cambodia Throughout the day first battalion 9th cavalry flew reconnaissance missions while elements of the 227th and 229th helicopter assault helicopter battions provided lift support to Arvan grunts and the 228th assault support helicopter battalion provided CH 47 heavy lift capability for the movement of artillery and other heavy equipment the invasion of Cambodia didn't didn't know what was coming the night before I got called into the company commanders office me and Reynolds and a couple of the two leaders and he said he poured eight drinks Scotch we're all sitting there looking each other like what else is and how many of them was here there's about eight of us in the middle of the night so one per guy how can we help ourselves echo through supplementation jockel fuel you got problems with your joints or you don't want to ever worry about your joints anymore take super cruel oil and joint warfare boom you want vitamin D3 supplementation which is good for all aspects of health if you care about that which we do because we're on the path boom jockel is that that as well also you want some additional protein we got milk and it tastes good how about that true put a banana and that's what I did something also got discipline and discipline go which are at its core I like the fact that I tell you Dary and I tell you that everybody already knows all this and you still tell this stuff to me like I'm hearing it for the first time well you're looking at me like hearing it for the first time So the monkey's sitting there and the monkey's jumping on his seat and he jumped over to the aircraft commander She's sitting then he climbed up on the first aid kit behind the aircraft commander scurry of on over in the first aid kit troops jump on board going for a combat assault and they think this is funny watching the monkey run back and forth two minutes out Cobbers roll hot one minute out the door gunners open up and when they opened up that monkey opened up with his bowels and his Piss all over the pilot all over the aircraft commander Scream and it said I'll find the aircraft commander reached up and grabbed him grabbed it by the neck and we're about 200 feet up Toss that monkey out the window I don't know if he learned how to skydive, but that monkey was gone It says he says I noticed one thing different about Those air force pilots from you guys air force pilots seem to be outgoing and always in a positive mood Versus you guys who always seemed withdrawn and pensive he explained and then you replied dad and air force pilot is that way Because he's flying a machine that wants to fly and if left alone will generally fly quite well on its own In addition compared to a helicopter an airplane has very few moving parts that can cause a serious malfunction on the other hand Helicopter pilots fly a machine that does not want to fly and only does and only does so by the Interactions of the pilot to balance four forces all opposed to each other plus a helicopter has a lot of moving parts any of which Breaking can and does cause a major disaster Helicopter pilots are moody because we know something is going to break if it hasn't done so already That's right that gave the old man something to think about it. I think it was Grossman He came back and went to flight school and graduated with flight school and came back to the office of pilot Here we go another mission and look I'm covering a Tiny percentage of this book and just trying to figure out which one of these freaking crazy missions to highlight Just it's like throwing it's like a roll the dice to pick one they're all they're all nuts Here's one at H minus one the door gunners open fire concentrating on the tree line as we touched down the grunt started off the aircraft that was when a sledgehammer hit the side of the aircraft one two times and then I lost count The engine started winding down the rotor RPM started dropping as the engine RPM went to zero I mean he was a he just Combat combat combat now he's going into Taroa and You know there's shelling in there's machine gun fire and I asked him I said so when you are getting out This is as they realize at Taroa, you know, they hit the coral reefs now They got a walk 800 yards and there's freaking Japanese machine gun fire coming I said we you know when you when you realize you're going to have to walk where you think and I might get shot or whatever He's like now that wouldn't happen to me. But he was doing his job and didn't want to go home we had a We had a war and officer that come into the unit and He flew Made aircraft commander and never flew a combat mission after that as your aircraft commander He would he would take the aircraft out and within 30 minutes you know he'd be coming back in complaining about something wrong with the aircraft And five they made him an assistant to ops officer and he served as a systems ops officer, but he never flew a combat mission again Brussels Chris he did the same thing quit college join the army I got a phone call from a recruit a one night saying hey I got your son here we're gonna sign him up for four years and I said no you're not you're gonna sign him up for two so and Chris wound up back in my brigade the first Brigade of the hundred and first in the scout patoon got out of went to college came back in on an RTC commission infantry and he just retired two years ago as Lieutenant Colonel and he got he was an infantry I didn't care we'd fly anything What you didn't like though is you got a different crew chief You always got a different crew chief in a different gunner because the crew chief and gunner always stayed with their aircraft Their aircraft was now from maintenance They were down from maintenance as well helping them get the aircraft ready we got back in that night and the medical officer came out and they stood the whole unit down Because I was the third aircraft come in that day and the other two aircraft came in and piloted both declared that's it We're done so the medical officer came out when the company commander came out and they ground it the whole unit You guys end up getting a valourist unit award. I need a little bit more than that Just let me know it's like gonna hit me That's so so six times you had that feeling yeah, and each time you had that feeling we got we got a little them living day like shot out of us Didn't lose anybody you ever have the feeling and it didn't and it didn't happen. So you got to work with the usually the same units and you got to know the the brigade staff at the you know Second brigade in the areas that you're working You got a good relationship with them that that carried over once you were back on day shift with these guys did you feel like safer because you're flying at night it's a good little deal it's fun check that one out again jockel store dot com if you like something you know get something uh you can also subscribe to this podcast there's not just this podcast also there's jockel unraveling myself and Darrell Cooper of Marter Made fame Z-famous from Marter Made yes in my mind you can check out jockel unraveling we're talking about a bunch of different things historical things and how they tying to what's going on right now we got the ground in podcast we got what you could podcast have new episodes up there you can also check us out at the jockel underground dot com jockel underground dot com this is yeah kind of in fact I'm glad you brought that up because um I've got two screenwriters and a producer right now and the screenwriters are taking the three they're taking two books the first two books and they're writing a screenplay and one of the things I've told them I says look guys I do not want this to be typical Hollywood and they're they're good guys a rich graph who starred in making the mob uh new york he played lucky Luciano in that and uh a guy named raki carlitch and krakki owns uh ghostwalker productions and then my producers Amy Soto and she's worked with John Malkovitch uh male gibbs and several of these guys so there there's good crew yeah fully go to go to flipsidecamp is dot com my brother Dakota Meyer he's got a company made in America making cool stuff to hang on your wall which is legit bunch of books we got a bunch of books we got the books that we talked about today the book we talked about today primarily was undaunted valor and assault helicopter unit Vietnam there's also volume two metal vanner and volume three which Matt Jackson Colonel Jackson said was the best of the three about about long lamson in uh 177 18 largest air battle um final spin I have a uh novel coming out myself yeah that happened We had a policy it got to the point where you know earlier you said in the book you know if you had 140 hours you got a couple of days down I was pushing over 160 hours and It got to the point where most of the pilots were the same boat. So we going on this combat assault We were in a chop five or six position and We're going in on a staggered right formation so you got one aircraft in front of you and you got one off the side Six minutes out the artillery goes in the artillery cuts off it two minutes out the coppers roll hot one minute out Door gunners open fire and right away we start seeing green tracers and I hear my crew chief's gunfire in Ralph didn't care didn't care reaching camp Corvad my saying his name or bad gorevad And that's named after the time the commander that that was killed during that assault Ralph landed at the engineering pad and told the Colonel politely but firmly to get out of his aircraft He then called our battalion headquarters on the radio which was being monitored by almost every pilot from the battalion And told them that he had just tossed the entost engineer six out of his aircraft and was returning to base to say the least Shit was about to hit the fan making that call on the radio Alerted every aircraft on the frequency as to what had happened However someone saw Ralph's position in this and nothing came of it at least on For Ralph Yeah, you talk about egos in the engineer had an ego and He was out to make himself a name for himself in the division. we but the good news is we got a new new guy it's arriving it's got about 1600 hours of flying time and a lot of experience and that's what we need guys a lot of experience here in the unit let's welcome the new guy lieutenant Corrie and I'm sitting here at the bar and I'm not facing him facing the bar made I'm going lieutenant yep and Kwon, Lloyd area flying Re-supply of One of the infantry battalions it was late in the afternoon the sun was setting we were monitoring the four radios when we heard the Mayday call Mayday Mayday, Lobo one three is going down Mr. Driscoe a cobra just went to the bamboo at three o'clock set our crew chief specialist Grossman Lobo one three got off One call before he plowed into the bamboo he was in a dive on a gun run and pulled out to late Only being able to get the nose of the aircraft up but not enough to stop his downward motion He crashed into ten foot high bamboo and put the aircraft over on its side He was on top of an NVA bunker complex quickly Mr. Driscoe took controls for me and told me to plot our location and get out in Additional Mayday call which I did alerting everyone where we were while I did that Mr. Driscoe made an approach into a small clearing He'd spotted close to the down-dear craft and landed. I said yeah, and that's why you know we fly something that doesn't want to fly a Harry Reesner about 1973 wrote a great article about Helicopter pilots and helicopters and it's it's kind of long that same line is what what dad-nice conversation was Yeah, well, it's like you said a plane You can you can let go of the stick and it'll kind of just cruise for a while. and we she's got a charity organization and if you want to donate or you want to get involved go to america's mighty warriors dot org and if you want any more and if you just feel like you need more of my protracted pontifications or you need more of echos confounding catechism you can find us on the inner webs on twitter on the gram or on that facebook echoes at echelon chal's nia matchocca willink and thanks once again to Colonel Matt Jackson for joining us and for writing these books but most important for his service to america and we will not forget the fallen soldiers of the 227th assault helicopter battalion freedom is not free and thanks to all the other men and women out there in uniform who are always on watch and ready to protect and defend our way of life and that includes not only the military but also police and law enforcement fire fighters paramedics EMT's dispatchers correctional officers border patrol secret service and all the other first responders thank you for protecting and defending us as well and to everyone else remember the price that was paid for our freedom and in the book undonned validers a part that I did not read today this is where Dan Cori and his team fly to an outstation to pick up some bodies of two soldiers that were killed in action and they arrive on scene and the two fallen servicemen wrapped in ponchos are loaded onto the old hui warboard warbird and Dan Cori whispers a prayer that he had written he says may they soar with the angels on wings of eagles may they watch over those they loved and those who love them may they rest in peace until we gather for the final formation but I advised that it be a closed casket ceremony I said before taking a sip of scotch why is that asked pop well there was an explosion and fire his body is in a plastic bag under a glass case on the glass case is as uniform with all his decorations the glass case is held down by 300 screws opening the lid is easy but not the glass case the rest of the evening was spent telling good stories of Bill from flight school and our one mission in Vietnam together between drinks and teary eyes we got through the night the day of the funeral came and Bill's sister Judy arrived early with her husband and children to cook breakfast the ride to church was quiet and we all sat together in the front of the church it was packed as maro when row was a small town and everyone knew the Michaels the preacher stood and gave the ulogy praising the work bill had done in the community and for the nation he said that Bill was not afraid of death but loved life few helicopter crews in Vietnam were afraid of death it was part of the job I cocked my 38 in weighted as Soon as the down pilots got the miniguns off the down cobra They ran to our aircraft and Mr. Driscoe pulled power to get us out of there as both gunners were firing and I emptied my 38 at the bamboo worthless weapon the down pilots thanked us profusely for saving their butts as They occupied the other side of the chicken pen their CEO came over that night and bought drinks for us at his club Since we no longer had one he invited major Anthony who declined to drink with us But made sure we didn't fly the next day a few months later I came in from my flight and lying on my bed were orders for an air metal with V the down to air crew had put in our crew for the award There was nothing our CEO could do about it and they made me the operations officer for the air cap squadron so I was up there for that for a year and then on a Friday night I got a phone call saying you you need to report to Hank Ridge on Monday morning we just relieved the company commander of the airborne company you're going to take command of the airborne company why did you get relieved I didn't ask that question haha she hacks that you roll in and take so it's now your company commander company commander of one of the airborne companies in Alaska how do you like groundwork I loved it I love groundwork I enjoyed flying no you really couldn't there was had the guys that were drafted you know people said oh they had bad attitudes I never saw but they all had a good attitude they were all in this together now what did happen guys that that were drafted and they came back from nom if they still had a year left they would send them to Germany and theirs were the problems were all that in Germany they had a big time morale problems there what are you going to do send me back to Vietnam been my dog tags it got to the point in Germany in the early 70s where the duty officers were armed with 45s But if you were gonna do something outside of the the normal formation flying like trying to pass somebody on the opposite side You had to be sure and communicate with them So that everybody understand what you're gonna do and evidently there was a lack of communications with these two guys and one flew right into the other You know You had to worry about getting shot at you had to worry about the aircraft maintenance failure and you had to worry about somebody flying into you Yeah, so that's why you see an airfield and there's an NVA right there Low-vo on my left in the bamboo fire I screamed as I increased power in airspeed rapidly staying low to the ground I had never seen so many enemy soldiers before as soon as I spoke 2.75 inch rockets were slamming into the bamboo and as NVA troops Ran and dove for cover low-vo was firing ripple effect Automatically launching 28 rockets would just one pole to trigger and punching the target Then as many gun opened on the tree line on my left as we were hauling ass down the runway as we cleared the abandoned SF camp and runway we stayed low level until we were confident we could climb to altitude and knock at hit by a 51 Cal Machine gun but something wasn't right and in the field of the aircraft the cyclic felt stiff and was getting Stiffer Mr. Corey we have a problem the housing for the push pole to be shot away and each time you move the Cyclic control it's binding the rods can you fix it? but you had that trust and bond built up amongst you know you all went to the same flight school You all understood about what what the different formations were and so you didn't do anything radical and even when we would fly You know our company would fly out there company because we all flew by an SOP We had a system we understood the system and so things were relatively safe It's when somebody would go do something like this that's out of the ordinary that that people got killed Oh Yeah, I Absolutely absolutely Fast forward a little bit throughout the spring and summer of 1969 enemy forces attack fire bases along the border Their tactics were always the same waiting until after midnight the enemy would commence their attack with a mortar and rocket Parage and concert with sappers attempting to penetrate the wire followed by infantry waves attempting to penetrate the perimeter LZ grant was a favorite target of these attacks several times between February and May LZ grant experience major attacks the first in February saw the battalion commander lieutenant Colonel Gorvad killed when around hit the talk He was seriously wounded, but refused to leave the battle the enemy managed to penetrate the perimeter wire and Fighting was fierce to include artillery lowering the tubes and firing point blank into the charging enemy with anti-personnel shot Blue max gunships were called in and engaged the follow on enemy as well as pursuing those attempting to retreat In May LZ grant was under attack again simultaneously Kwon Lloyd LZ Jamie and LZ Phyllis also came underground assaults that night the enemy wanted the first cavalry division out of three core region Which was not going to happen. but if there was a great guy we got the chance to fly together one time had a kick a kick day that day picked him up he'd never flown to combat mission you know flying VIPs around that's all he ever did so I picked him up went out to a firebasing they had a batag commander out there he was crazy as hell had a big red bow on the back of his helmet I never asked him why that was there It was obvious that someone had landed the aircraft before the enemy Open fire with some heavy weapons as the only damage to the aircraft was in the cockpit and transmission and none in the engine or belly The skids indicated a normal landing Dave and YA were still strapped in their seats and Sergeant Alfred the door gunner was in his as well The crew chief however was found about a hundred yards from the down-dear craft it appeared that specialist Collins fought as M.T. as M.T. 556 shell casings were around him, but not a weapon the aircraft was booby trapped the Colonel and his staff were dead in the back of it There'd been no friendly soldiers at the location Damn that son of a bitch has gotten more aircraft shot up than anyone damn his sorry ass So you're looking to see where most of the shootings at and you come in most of the time you come in fast and low and Kick out and just that's the way the grunts want if they didn't want to have to run out there to grab ammo or grab your aircraft But then as a day light came out then you'd start going in there and start getting more of the resupply in Bring in reinforcements in I talked about we did one night combat assault that we brought Reinforcements in and we put them about two clicks out and they were catching the NBA as the NBA and then we flew out and went with another brigade to another location and secured that for the gas station I was in a state shock that we got to that second location we were engaged in some Iraqis and my S3 came up and said sir, ceasefire and so what are you talking about ceasefire we're in the middle of contact here, surcees fire it's word came down from Brigade with the ceasefire I said you go back and had called Brigade for clarification on that I'm not ceasefire and right now somebody shooting at us and he came back There was no doubt in your mind But we're shooting at you Little leadership here major Anthony, so you get a new a new company commander major Anthony now the new company commander Justored they're looking over us and we at him no one said anything until he finally told us to take our seats He then went on to give us his philosophy on command and how he expected the unit to operate an hour an hour later in the club some discussions took place about what had been said Mike said Dan what did you get out of the major speech? I was commanding the airborne company 79 they made me the operations officer for the infantry battalion how was the how was the post Vietnam years in the army terrible absolutely terrible we didn't have any any ammunition to train with the fact the soldiers they would charge up a hill and a training exercise and they go bang bang bang 13 cents bang bang bang 13 cents because that was a cost of training rounds 13 cents around but we didn't even have training rounds it was really pretty bad near me we went through a period from 70 to 75 what we were rifting captains and that just killed them aral in the captains ranks uh I was in the advance course in 73 therefore many we had 10 200 man classrooms on one side of the building 10 200 man classrooms on the other side of the building all full all of them infantry captains back Vietnam and on one day they walked in and from getting a 200 man class every one of those rooms went down to be in 140 man class those captains were pulled out they told you have 90 days to get out where you can divert to be in a sergeant one of the other I started easing up on the I started easing the nose up slowly the air speed began to bleed off 89 70 not 60 knots and our speed continued to drop we were slapping the tops of bamboo stocks now 20 knots Bamboo stocks were breaking off and I could feel the main roader Buffeting as we hit thicker vegetation I just didn't want to know what kind of vegetation at this point just don't let us hit a hardwood tree trunk and rip the rotor head off At 20 knots the skids touched the ground and we're sliding along Steering with the pedals to maintain a straight line broken bamboo was whirling about as if it was in a tornado as the aircraft came to a stop I was shutting the engine down while linemen and Dietrich had the guns in hand with belts of ammo in their arms and I mean he's got the stinger service cross this is in 73 and he got rifted one of the guys that that I work with in 75 Charlie had he had silver stars a couple of silver stars purple heart couple of stinger flying crosses got rifted he's now he got out And it was just kind of nice to be able to look out there couldn't fly at the doors off during the day for some reason, but We like flying in at night like that so and and go an example there you talked about three times Same up there so you got the 50 cal on the back you got what a cobra gun ship as well with all their munitions That's what's crazy you these helicopters you get shot down and you just leave the bird and then a CH 40 47 would come in Strap on to the thing and take it on well what happened is that a bird would go down and first in the night's calf They always had a rapid reaction force this called their blues and they would fly in that rapid reaction force Into where the aircraft was if it was salvageable set security yet set security and then they'd hooked the the aircraft up to a CH 47 and 47 would pull the aircraft out and fly it back to its own base and That's all they did with this one. But this period of time when Saunders got there that's when we started losing a lot of birds and it kept right on up for the rest of the time I was there The night birds the who had minimum minimum instruments for weather flying and If the guys didn't practice their weather flying they were rusty at it and tried to pull off from the fog That sounds like what happened there. I The first the first time I happened I went out to the aircraft one day and just didn't have a good feeling Got got shot up bad that day And I said I said he said hey you got it you know get talk to Johnny get him on that first bird out of here man He's gonna you know he's he's he's losing it but it's a huge you deal here's the thing though if let's say you need stuff beyond jiu jitsu stuff like you got your jiu jitsu stuff handled you got the ghee you got the rash guard you still might need to go to the grocery store you can't wear the ghee to the grocery store what you can wear is American made jeans not to make you can't make it as American made boots true you get it all there Hollywood just makes it look kind of odd but uh when you have an SOP you can say all right this is what we're gonna do and here's how we're gonna do it and you don't take a lot of discussion with it and and some of that works out pretty well it worked out for well for me for one exercise where uh found out my LZ uh the opt for uh reserve was sitting on my LZ and I grabbed the the flight leaders grabbed the company commander sat down pulled a poncho over our heads turned the flashlight on said okay here's your new LZs any questions you know what what it happened I got I was getting calls that that morning I got a call somebody seen a uh Mr. Corrie understand you're going to battalion so when you talk about I'm going to come to battalion So we got Mr. Clinton, got rhythm Mr. Clinton, got rhythm, got rhythm, got a sergeant moron. Yeah, I was telling you earlier that Pilot was never really my kind of thing like I have no desire to be a pilot That's one that's like couple the reasons right there I like relying on some big big machine with a bunch of parts that I don't understand That's gonna keep me alive and keep my friends alive. I mean bell helicopter built a great aircraft force and it did well the Hue's built the OH6 which you see those with the MH6 is now in the in task force 160 the OH6 Guys love the fly that thing because if it got shot down It would crash the road ahead come off the tail boom come off and it rolled like an egg crazy crazy stuff the whole thing just the fact that those helicopters are basically like a 1968 VW bug like they got an engine they got a steering wheel you know there's not a lot of there's no computers in this They know there's is there anything like Power steering the only thing that was that was the governor the fuel on the the Huey There was control the throttle was controlled by a governor so once you started the aircraft up you brought the throttle up all the way And the governor would stop at at 6600 RPM on the engine and you had a governor control switch If that went out then you had to fly the aircraft manually and I want every aircraft pre-flighted tonight I want maintenance to know right away if an aircraft's got a problem yes in fact our operational plans my last objective was the airport at Baghdad we had planted out that far as where we were gonna go and so when we got the word stop after four days we're going what in the world has gone on I have heard because because right now I'll put a shameless plug in I'm right in another three book series on desert storm and and I have found out my research that one of the reasons that we stopped was because Turkey did not want us to overthrow Saddam because Saddam they felt was the only one to keep the Kurds in check and Turkey said don't go to Iraq and then Schwartzkoff's guidance was kicking out of Kuwait it didn't have any guidance supposedly to go after him in Iraq so that's one of the reasons we stopped but we're cranking 21 aircraft tomorrow morning so next morning we got up all the birds cranked up current or the boss the CO he led the assault we went up to a stage field and we're sitting here with our 21 aircraft and here came Bravo company with their 21 and Charlie company with their 21 and then 10 CH 47's but we got up there we said all right we're in new environment let's learn how to do this new environment so we spent a lot of time learning desert techniques studying up on what the desert rats had done in World War II looking at some stuff that we've received from SAS about desert operations and just started practicing that stuff and the kids the kids did great the soldiers did fantastic and then the war kicks off and how's it guns and ammo I asked my gunner fresh cans ammo this morning Mr. Curry were good Mr. Cory were good He responded I climbed up and looked over the roader head while my coat pilot for the day worn off Sir Ron Fender did the walk around inspection and tail rotor all appeared to be good We strapped in start of the engine and waited ready ready to assume the mission if called upon Hey one nine or two seven is down assume his mission in contact Badger six when you reach quann loy for further instructions Flight operator instructed Roger 3 and the one nine or has it I started pulling power Welcome sir on blue price heading back to the states in a month He said and left the mess hall lieutenant dick weed was in Vietnam on his first tour and he would prove to be a cocky guy If he wasn't in charge of something he tried to make himself in charge and a one more than one occasion was put in his place by a flight Leader or an aircraft commander he arrived the unit before I made aircraft commander and they lay down some stumps and there was just something about this right seat pilot that the day I met him I looked at him and said this kid's not going to make it there was nothing about him tell me you know he wasn't competent he was he was at halfway decent pilot he was a nice guy but there was just something about it that told me he's going to make it like yeah just completely manually maneuvered through space and he made a good point through that like you kind of don't think about compared to when he compared it to airplanes we're like brother helicopters all you they're playing a lot of time you can sort of let it cruise 26th Phoenix August 17th and 18th and Las Vegas October 28th and 29th go to extremotorship.com everything that we've done has sold out these are going to sell out too especially because we got a little less people for social distancing and whatnot so less seats so they're going to sell out if you want to come go to extremotorship.com asapee we have eF battlefield which is us for this particular one the next one we've got up is us walking the battlefield at getty'sburg this is a small number of people attending very small Yeah That you talk about that here exactly what happened when I this is fast forward a little bit when I returned from my mission That evening major Saunders approached my aircraft as I was shutting down Mr. Cori award police he said as opposed you open my door the major was standing in front of my aircraft and hadn't approached me I asked I was in total shop shock They were on a resupply over a hoverhole the gooks open fire on them on their third pass and they crashed into the trees Grunt said that they made each of their three approaches over the same ground They had five new replacements on board the grunts got to the aircraft and we're shooting gooks in the cabin and a cockpit Who was the crew it was ash as AC and a newbie Taylor your crew chief linemen Linem is that any says name? so you know stuff like that was pretty realistic to what was going on where apocalypse now was blowing smoke well when the joke the joke that I forget who it was they played a joke and you said hey don't salute me that was our operations officer when I got there and they said I'm crying I've read this thing it's intense and and I will warn you right now if you thought the combat scenes in the first one were intense that one there is just unbelievable it is absolutely unbelievable what those guys went through and in flying that operation I just can't say enough about it the bravery the determination the dedication the loyalty the courage you know it would be awesome is if if you've gotten a friends or you know anyone that was there the A O improving roads building a school and supporting projects on the various fire bases The day started off normal and they were visiting the various locations however just after the lunch things changed The Colonel wanted to go on a recon of some areas Ralph agreed to fly those areas and be and proceeded to fly between Corn, Lloyd and Song Bay the Colonel was focused on looking for clearings Finally, he asked Ralph to take them down and land in one Ralph asked for the frequency and call sign of the unit in the clearing so he could contact them prior to landing Especially as he didn't see anyone in the clearing the Colonel came up with an excuse for why he couldn't provide the information and told Ralph just to land Ralph insisted on a call sign of frequency before you take the aircraft down the Colonel became I rate but uh that was the first day at the Cambodian invasion we did three assaults at day putting Vietnamese soldiers in so he was a big day then things got hot the next day next day the NVA waiting for the helicopters and we started taking a lot of hits the next days it's uh it's kind of crazy But we always felt that you know if somebody got shot I have both pilots got wounded somebody's gonna have to bring this bird back so we would train the crew chiefs to do running landings I think I think the helicopter potts for a large extent had that same attitude You know as hey we hate seeing aircraft go down It's going to be somebody go down, but it's not going to be me and you just you just didn't think about that happening to you if you did You probably wouldn't have finished the mission yeah, that was, I don't know, I don't know when that, I don't know where that came from, but when I got the seal teams. But we fly every day and and that was his point Army of policy was you would not drink 24 hours for you fly or smoke within 50 feet of the aircraft well warn officer does it Make you didn't smoke 24 hours for you flew or drink within 50 feet of the aircraft
