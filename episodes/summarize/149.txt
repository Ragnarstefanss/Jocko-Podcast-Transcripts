my given a copy of the book and I said and this is what General Schultz thinks about it and over time you know it's it's been mandatory reading and the common uns reading list for decades and I can't tell you how many others I've gotten from read particularly staff and seals you know I'm here when I was in Bay Route you know as a as a journal Sarah 83 there was a there was one gunnery sergeant who came and told me I have read your book 11 times it is a text on you know on leadership if you really read it and and at the same time the the important thing also is if you're if you're going to write a novel that lasts you want that universality as you say this doesn't just fit not just isn't my experience and so it really is a very carefully drawn moral drama and you know some of these passes is you're gonna have a hundred many years and I still remember because I've written some of these twenty five times you know the the one you start off with I knew the words you know I knew the words were gonna come out of your mouth so that is you know that was my intention of with with the book and you know what kind of say it's still out there but I didn't one of the one of the toughest moments you know of that period of my life was when I was the brigade administrative officer and so you know my job which wasn't much of a job was to go to one of the things was to go to the main office clear out all the correspondence in there sort it out pass it to the rest of the brigade staff etc and one of them was bringing the casualty reps to the brigade first lieutenant who who kept the board on and without even knowing it while I picked them up I picked up the casualty report of one of my good friends and you you graduate from the academy and it's time to go to time to go to time to go to time to go to the basic school and learn and you know I've talked about a bit about the base school that Marines on here that that went through it a brine stand and he gave us pretty good details on the basic school and but obviously at this time for you you know I'm going to just go to the book for the Marines combat and overseas deployments were unending the greatest burden fell on the privates and lands corporels fresh from boot camp who populated the lower ranks of the rifle pletoons and the lieutenant's just out of the basic school who commanded them the basic school which we called TBS was now starting a new class of 250 lieutenant's every three weeks in pre-veate nom days TBS had taken 30 weeks to complete as Vietnam accelerated the time a new lieutenant spent at TBS was reduced to 26 weeks and then to 21 but true to the traditions of long-held disciplines of the core this reduction took place not by cutting the quality or the content of the curriculum but by rather by lengthening the number of hours spent in class and in the field every work week almost every week TBS companies worked late in the Saturday evening they spent a high percentage of their time in the field and a large percentage of that time was dedicated to night maneuvers and bivouacs our company was given the day off on Christmas working late into the evening of December 24th and assembling on the tarmac for a field activity at 0630 in the morning of December 26th within a month of within a month after finishing TBS the infantry lieutenant's among us would be boarding military flights to travel sir for space California to report immediately for 13 month tours in Vietnam as individual replacements in infantry battalions that were already engaged in sustained heavy combat well of course let me say something about about basic school at that time that's probably the best school I've ever been to day as I wrote the the course got condensed in its time but not in the quality of what they were preparing us to do on the one hand the Marine Corps had dropped the 60 millimeter mortar out of its arsenal after the Korean war they decided that they didn't need it with more artillery closer etc they learned early in the Vietnam war that it was a valuable weapon they put the 60 mic mic package back into basic school so actually added a tactical package into the basic school curriculum they cut out some of the dress and ceremony stuff you know they did take that stuff out not all of it but some of it but how they used stuff outside the battlefield they were very focused on who they were who they were after in addition to like showing that they could they could meet up with us but even on even on that war I mean we adapted and in that area that I operated in you know by the time I had been there for five months I understood the temple of that place I understood where they were they were where they had been I could anticipate them and we did some I think some really great things by the time I got to be a company commander out there in terms of knocking knocking them off balance keep in the morale of our troops up you know showing them that we we really we could go where they were and we could figure out what they were going to do the third was the key and I will say I want to see a couple of things about that first you know the the South Vietnamese the motivation of the South Vietnamese I think has been misunderstood I didn't understand this one I was in Vietnam I understood this a lot better when I got back from Vietnam I started working with the Vietnamese community here after 1975 helping them understand a political system that they were moving into you know they came they came here they were very they were organized into community groups they they knew that you know they we're going to put the future into their kids you know from day one it was like you get a job you know but meeting with them get a job get your kids in school the next generation is going to succeed and then the other thing which I think is so important you know when you say know your people know you know what's the leadership is knowledge know your people know your job know their job and know the next job because you never know when something's gonna happen and you're gonna have that next job but he could still give me the individuals names and I still could I'm not going to but you know that the naval academy at that time you know the pendulum swings in terms of indoctrination and the you know where education fits in and what type of education etc etc but that our this class in the 1968 depending on them in terms of pleb and doctrine nation had swung very far and it was by company really they were like tribal systems were 36 different companies and some of them were relatively loose and some of them were really you know actually we had two two companies in in my class that ran out physically ran out more than half of their plebes and these are people who were highly screen I give some details in the book about the number of class validic torrents varsity athletes eagle scouts etc which actually when people have asked me you know what what's the great benefit you got out of going to the naval academy one thing I said as well I knew that I could achieve among these people who had achieved in different ways and in high school I had I learned you know that I could compete in and that you know why was on the right track at a two to one everything you know we can go places now we couldn't go three years ago you know you are you are winning and you know it's first time anybody ever ever said that to me you know and another comment needs to be made and that is that the South Vietnamese leadership the military leadership my age there were a lot of really fine leaders in there and even even David Hackworth you know who said you know this North Vietnamese Lash gun be flying over Saigon by 1975 also said emphatically to me when I was interviewing him if you'd gotten these people into position they would have they would have I'm not going to say they would have won but they would have survived South Vietnam would have survived like South Korea it was Germany survive for eventual better solution so they they have been I think you know libeled in in history in terms of the competence of a lot of their they're really good leaders and people and soldiers and and reads and that's but if you're out here in the in the enwa basin the one thing that a a good rifle platoon or company commander or batang commander learned was how to adapt how to adapt you couldn't rarely you could rarely plan operations you know sort of like like Mike Tyson said about being in a fight everything is great until the first time you get hit you know on any given patrol or day in the enwa basin particularly near is on a valley you could hit you know some idiot with not idiot maybe some smart smart individual or small group of people with a couple of grenades or you could hit a main force the a con unit which was heavily north Vietnamese or you could hit a large for large force north Vietnamese we fought in in may of nineteen sixteen what we've nine we fought with the the ninety of the regiment in the years on a valley went on for eight days and eight nights we had a north Vietnamese division in base area one twelve right off from where we were the the mountain started up into louse with a hoochman trail that sort of thing we had a very fine of the con regiment which was you know rather rare that an independent regiment the first VC regiment we had to Q80 third main force for spatayan that will operate out of the Arizona valley and in you had a lot of cats and dogs and the other thing was this area had basically been written off by by American war planners in terms of the the politicization you know they're bringing into the south Vietnamese government at that time they categorize villages in talk categorized villages a through e in terms of loyalty to the south Vietnamese government a was totally loyal he was totally the on the other way so um and also it's kind of interesting because I was just talking to a friend of mine who is in government right now who is a very fine football player and we were comparing it was talking about how hard it was to deal with a certain individual because he'd been a wrestler and he didn't understand how you know you get the team around you to solve these problems well you know you learn to step forward and take responsibility for solutions you know if you're an individual support I mean they probably more than any other kind of a sport you know it's like all right this is what I believe and this is what I'm gonna fight for and if we lose with those but this is what we're going to do and in my life combining that with with the Marine Corps you know where you are responsible for the lives of other people and you have to make decisions that affect other people there couldn't have been better training for any other leadership situation I've been in when when going back to where you got selected amongst for this scholarship program you one thing you said is here nobody's gonna work me to have so as I remember the day I got that because I just say well you know one of the of you're an anton myr anton myr's books I have not once an eagle I have not when we when the actually I think I have red wants an eagle it's a great great book you know when when when when when we sent the proofs around on on the fields the you know prensaul didn't quite know what to expect they you know the book had been rejected by 12 publishers nobody wanted to see this side of it and the the other in chief of prensaul John Kirk had been a naval invader in in the Korean war it was a Harvard graduate which I I thought was kind of interesting because when he asked me to come and talk to him he asked me to meet him at the Harvard club you know good riches the Harvard goof you know and I've got you know many many friends who were Arvin and Vietnam who will talk to you about what happened when the watergate Congress took over you know in Nixon resigned and then you know this anti-work Congress came in and one of the first substantive votes they took was to cut off all supplemental appropriations to the South Vietnamese Army there was there was no reason for that well our our forces weren't even on the ground over there and at the same time the North Vietnamese refurbished and they attacked them when they were reposition that reposition I have a really great friend you know who when I was listening to your show that we're talking about the American who had spent nine years as a prisoner of war Le Cal who's here now spent 12 years on the battlefield was a regimental commander he's 28 recipient of their metal varnish and in 13 and a half years locked up five years on a connox box he was down to two artillery rounds per tube per day when it was trying to reposition his forces when this thing hit so it was a very complicated war I'm not trying to like you know re you know re imagine what was happening and I you know as as we discussed earlier it was an avid reader I loved I loved to write I was writing for my job I wrote three magazine articles in that year one of them was very controversial it was about the roles and missions of the Marine Corps how they were on paper and amphibious force and they were doing all these other things and it did it make a difference in my bottom line which you better believe it makes a difference there's not one marine general on any of these jaystaffs anywhere except that you know if if the Navy gives him one and the Marine Corps wasn't even represented when they decided that that was their mission it was the chief of naval operations and I was 25 years old and I got in big trouble you think I got in big trouble and some of these other things I've written you know the chief of staff of the Marine Corps was calling me into talking to me in the continent ordered a counter article to be written about what I had said because they were being accused in a jacus of you know this you know wanting to start some sort of a campaign you know but this class I think we started with 1350 and the first week or two of a pleb year when some people resigned they allowed new increments to come in just for very short period of time so let's just stick with 1350 I think we graduated 841 we had the highest attrition rate of any post war naval academy and post war war two naval academy class and there were some really people who would have been fine officers who were run out for one reason or left and that time period two coincided with the very beginning of the Vietnam War the civil rights movement a lot of different you know things that were tearing the country aside I can remember coming back from boxing practice in summer of 1964 we had to know the one of the rates when you went down on the tables was to know the three top new stories of the day and there on the front page with the Gulf of Tonkin incident you know in the Gulf of the coast of Hanoi the picture of the CO and we were like saying okay this is this is really going to happen we the year that I graduated in 1968 was was the the worst year for American casualties and it also was the year where in April Martin Luther King was killed and in June the night before we graduated Robert Kennedy was assassinated it was just in an end to back it up into the Tet 68 offensive happened before Martin Luther King was killed so that we just boom boom boom the last year and different people reacted in different ways um here's here's you're sorry he's talked a little bit about the overall kind of the overall I guess the overall occurrences that we're going on were beyond what's just sitting right in front of you so here we go but something else was going on at stem from the reality that on any given day three different wars were being fought in the basin the first war involved conventional combat against north Vietnamese army regulars and main force via con soldiers the second war was the daily challenge of an insurgency dominated by a long-term war of a tradition aimed at driving American public opinion and troop morale against our own involvement in Vietnam at the beginning of what became known as the American war communist leader Ho Chi Minh famously predicted for every one of you we kill you will kill ten of us but in the end it is you will who will grow tired the third war focused was a focused and precise form of domestic terrorism at this point in our history America's top leadership had yet to fully grasp the power and impact of a type of terrorism that went well beyond the traditional notions of military insurgency nor did the south Vietnamese government ever find a way to completely counter it it was sorry largely invisible war of terror and subduction was taking place daily among the rural populace designed to discredit the south Vietnamese government and to drive a murderous wedge between the people and the government and you go on to talk about Bernard Fal and his book you know he's a French author who wrote a bunch of books uh spent time there wrote a book called Helen a very small place and he warned the dick van am I saying that right dick van dick van or moral intervention contracts these were groups and what they were doing was the violent act for psychological rather than military reasons which is the source of the success of the Vietnam and the dick van will simply go on murdering village chiefs youth leaders teachers and anti-malarial teams thus isolating the sagon government from the countryside and you describe one of these situations there was no warning from around that unseen bend the air suddenly belched and erupted quick explosions piercing our ears and reverberating like an unseen blast a wind my adrenaline surged I counted three quick bursts of rifle fire and then a womb of three grenades the entire platoon became animated tense picking up the pace to a jog as we strode toward the noise within a few heart beats a young Vietnamese wild-eyed and gasping for breath collided on the trail with the point man of a platoon instinctively the marine tackled the young man and held them on the ground we did not know it yet but it really is you know institutionally important the Marine Corps fire teams for four Marines it was built around the BAR Browning automatic rifle it had it had had been put into place in in World War II because at the beginning of World War II the Marine Marines only operate in the squad like 11 11 Marine Squad and they found that a squad that couldn't control directly control 11 people so they went under the triangular concept with the you know the the former in fire teams but the problem with that was if you took two casualties you don't have a maneuver element and it is built around an an artificial notion because the M16 could be fully automatic you know like I had I kept some in four teens in my platoon as well so what the the young leaders in the in a fifth Marines just sort of over time to start doing was cannibalizing the third rifle squad and so in in our rifle platoon instead of having three rifle squads and in a gun team attached from this notion of weapons platoon we put the riflemen into two squads and then brought the gun team in as the third squad for the triangular concept and that just kind of happened you know It was like the beginning of GT you know or whatever You know you're gonna you're gonna be like an experiment you're gonna grow it academically your own rate by the time I got One two three like the fifth school in in Nebraska I was on non-college prep work where you These get this guy out of here You know I ended up you know like you let us go an hour early and I went to work but they were saying despite what I mentioned earlier about the assassination programs that were not fully understood in our country they were saying the people who were opposed to the war were saying the South Vietnamese are so corrupt they won't go out there you know we have a district chief in Donning he lives in his villa he has a great life he won't go out to the animal base and so our company commander who part of his first story had done is a pacification officer working with them said we're going to get him out here we're going to get him out here we're going to protect him and they found out about that and as as I wrote in the book I mean they killed 17 of their own people in one little room and the the district chief and his aid you know just to send the signal that signal was well understood you know by the people in in these areas and what we were doing was not as well understood even by ourselves one of the you know the most interesting moments for me was when I had a I've sworn the end of my tour I had a marine who was getting court martialed and to me for hitting an NCO you would not in my company anymore yeah because every one of us knows that if our luck had run out or if someone among us had made one in invertean mistake we could have died there no question you can be as one thing about you know I've heard you talk about I eat these before you know I would say 25 to 30 percent of our casualties were IDs most of were gunshot a lot of shrapnel moves but with an ID there's nothing more to more lacing or booby trap as we call it them and the take of your movie in at night the casualties are large and there's nowhere to put your anger you know and and if you're on the outside of that you go well you know that easily could have been made you can be a hundred percent right and still be dead we had one device on a night move every member of my platoon stepped over it on a narrow trail I was walking forth forth for three in the in a column and the last I had a brand new guy I put him on tail and Charlie it was a company who actually didn't batay in him it was a company move and it was some branch on the trail or something called boom and you know there were 19 casualties and a ambush after that you know I think we were talking about this last night attitude development is the key to everything you know and getting your mind right is to in terms of what you're going to do and knowing the assets that are available and you know I've spent a lot of time thinking about this too you know in terms of what what I was going to face I had I had one really terrific mentor who what when I graduated from the Naval Academy I spent like two months as a drill officer at the with the new class coming in before reported to basics school and I was a battalion drill officer there were six of us there were six battalions I got the marine battalion officer who had just gotten out of the hospital from him been wounded and in Conteanne was a company commander Alpha but he you know he took one character actually two characters but from before we were one all the way into Vietnam or that we didn't call it Vietnam and his book you know one of them was you know on Nebraska farm kid who was enlisted and you know and got a battlefield commission or war one and the other was a you know West Point guy who punched all the buttons exactly right his name was mass and gale another one was Sam David but he wrote really good combat scenes people like him you know reacting to this gamble you know at at the time because there's nothing out like this at the time as it was the first revisionist novel and I'll tell you when I went on my tour I'd spend a year and a half on I was working on the House of Veterans Committee developing what I sort of a a factual basis for discussion on on the Vietnam war you know how long did people really serve how many were drafties how many were volunteers what what was the makeup of the casualties you know and those who served etc etc etc etc just trying to lay the whole thing out year by year you know I know when to go online I know when to put my troops on high know where to put my guns that didn't come from from basically school the separate the separate entities did we connected it in in the in the reality of of what we were doing and I'll tell you there's a long line we're getting a little head of things but there there's a long line of things that the young leaders in fifth Marines had done before I got there and and also in what I was able personally to do is a rifle platoon and and and particularly as a as a company commander one of the things we saw and I wrote an article about this concept when I got back from Vietnam was that the Marine Corps fire team this is simple and small but it sounds like some good advice i'll keep that one in my back right there are a lot of words going back and forth when you're getting ready to ship out and from from your perspective having grown up like with such a with such a focus on leadership and your family and the tradition and your family and showing up as a lance corporal inside of a platoon and having more awareness than the normal lance corporal would have because i'll tell you i mean if i'm picture myself when i'm 19 years old if i was a lance corporal i would have been a normal lance corporal i would have been you know i wouldn't have had this sort of elevated look at things i mean even having read your dad's book over and over again and and just just that level of understanding how did that how did that how did that how did that set in your platoon how did that set with you were you ever were you ever looking at your boss thinking or looking at your platoon commander thinking uh did he listen to you did he talked to you did he know who you were did he what was there anything like that they all knew um i think the the best or the most of my time i kept that off the skyline was two to three days no matter which unit i was at a boot camp i got pulled out and parade it around you know they uh in this area in this area of Vietnam um they could become accustomed to a lot of our operational decisions you know we like the high ground we like to get a spot where you can see some of these rice patties were like a mile wide you know and if you and you want to place where you can have visuals and also provide you know potential supporting weapon rate for people crossing the patio center etc and i always did actually wonder about that more cowbell where did now you know you never know what you'd learn also psychological warfare that's an album with tracks where you can stay on the path and we're making another one it's coming out soon and that's it on that good also if you want to vary up your workout get more workout gear good on it dot com slash jockel also they got some good immunity stuff that i actually took you reminded me because i just took some felt the cold coming on true tech immune it's good on you like that one very much like that one never let me know before you travel take that nonetheless there's a lot of cool stuff on there and information that's another one that like you can get caught up in a bad way i i didn't you know i like talk about leadership the leadership lessons inside fields of fire are phenomenal just the pattern recognition of knowing what kind of people you're dealing with and you can learn a lot of that just from the book but i'd love to hear about you know how you got to some of those characters one of my well one real obvious characters austin uh sergein austin who's like the by the book marine that's hey it's my way or the highway and and just the way you know just the way that haggis kind of handles him and and there's a certain there's a conversation that they're having and you can see haggis is pushing that pushing back up against him a little bit it's what it is it's insane and that's just normal life on a carrier and you know the difference in the same thing talking about my dad and the missile squad the difference back then and now was I had a little eight millimeter movie camera and you know after even you know I could go sit on the flight deck and take pictures of flight ops you know now the you know for for safety reasons and whatever other reasons you can't do that you know it was just a kind of a different thing than boxing but I've always thought about that you know and in other areas of of of of my life I've thought about that and in terms of boxing you know you never know who the judges are you know and then there's what I like to call daily courage you know and daily courage is taken a hand God dealt you and doing something with it you know like Tom Martin who was one of my squad leaders was he's now passed away he was an interesting I mean it was it was an interesting ear for me in the bush he had been in Vanderbilt University he was favor the war I wasn't a debate on the war and this guy who supposedly is going to Canada turn around and said if you think this is such a great war why don't you disco servant and he enlisted it's a very very smart knowing guy could you know when things would get down you can talk talk to me about different stuff then he got shot but I think the majority of the people that I was with there during that period it gave us a real seriousness of purpose we knew we were going it wasn't going to go away particularly for the Marine Corps we all knew that we were going and so by the time I graduated there was no doubt in my mind where where I was going to go was one of the reasons why on first class crews you know at the Naval Academy it used to be after your first year you crueced with the enlisted folks you know we I lived with the Snipes on a CVS after my first app was a great learning experience too by the way to see how hard those guys worked on here I hardly ever saw the light of day they were a trip to in a living spaces I remember when they you know that we had like six or seven midship and in this big living space i mean australia new zeland i've gotten a whole package of letters from a classroom in new zeland of kids that are on the path so if you read a book imagine you're you read a book and you're seven years old nine years old and you decided that the book was good enough that you were gonna try and find the author who lives on the other side of the world and write them a note and say thanks because i'm on the path now that's the book right there way the warrior kid and marks mission also discipline equals freedom field manual this you know what this is christmas time you get to christmas this book is a gift it's a gift for people that you know that you want to help if you have an enemy don't give it to him is in your enemy's gonna get on the path probably come back and whatever 18 months and they'll be jacked and they'll be focused and they'll crush you or yes you're right or that could if that but knowledge of people and listening to people I would go in and the first you know month or so that I was a platoon commander I would take three hours to set my lines in every night sit down every fighting hole talk to everyone in my roommates and you find out as you know you find out really interesting things about maybe simple things like somebody hadn't gotten paid or somebody got married and had a queue a lot and it's not going to his wife and nobody's taken care of just simple things you know and We you know we talked about working through high school because I worked all through high school and He would come after this he'd come over as packing groceries at the base commester He'd come by and say hello and the The second interviewer was a naval academy graduate who had graduated and the bottom two thirds of his class and From from South Dakota and he he was saying We don't we got enough brains in this world we need leaders and he threw Examples out you know like things you're not supposed to be able to solve you probably know this from different interviews You went through and in your time in the Navy so he goes We got all this mud in the Mississippi river. but you know I mean reality is reality it is indeed once you touch them then it's different you know and speaking of reality being reality and it's is uh to to kind of point out some of the reality that's in this book I got one more thing I want to read from it how'd you like to stay in on Ocanawa sir that's right the major smiled Jesus Lieutenant I thought you would have jumped over the desk by now I'm on the level we just had a bill it opened up over at special services recreation officer a lieutenant rotated early on emergency leave he had less than 90 days on his tour so he'll be reassigned from the states I have the authority to fill the bill bill it from the transient tube been in country already your ideal combat time hospital time would you like it the major gybedom grinning good duty lots of free time stick around Hodges will turn you into a whole mongering drunk a simple and it's still there and that is that the people who went over and interrupted their lives a lot of them just spent one one tour in the record what home have never been fully appreciate have never been fully understood you know and what they did getting that down you know that the environment in which they served and you know that the there's a when we talk about courage that's physical courage which is maybe shooting somebody in one corner there's moral courage which is standing up for what you believe in and having the courage to say it to those above you and sometimes you have to say it to those who are who are below you you know oh you know i'm not gonna put push back any further because i'm gonna create a relationship with this guy and we'll get him along the way but those little subtleties that you put in this book are our phenomenal leadership lessons one one one one small point on that because i probably should have mentioned it earlier in terms of one of the motivations in writing and is there there was so much out there demeaning things that happened in Vietnam without a comprehensive understanding not only of Vietnam but of warfare in general that i felt like it was important to to create characters that could give context to how some of the things happen you know um that's with with sergeant austin how to you know and I'm going in and all these guys are running the other way and that bomb had had landed on the pack of our 81's F4 artillery radio operator I mean pack of the pack board you know dead center if that thing had gone off curtains you know and the other thing with it is night moves you know where one of the things you learn is in in when you when you operate like the fifth Marines did is always be responsible for the person behind you not the person in front of you if you lose the person in front of you stop don't try to catch up with them because there there were a number of friendly fire incidents where someone would get you lost try to catch up end up to the on the flank of of the the main unit and you'd have an animal firefight luckily we didn't have that happening my company and so you had these assassination squads move into into this area and by 1961 they were killing eleven government officials a day and that was by John Kennedy's account when he decided to start increasing our troops there so the villages had had their fights beginning 58 heavily 58 to 62 that time period and those who were staying with with the communist basically had kicked out the people who weren't a lot of move to dinang and some of them later to sagan so out where we were you I say this because operationally they populated villages that we that we operated in and they had big family bunkers they were very you know there was stoic when we went through their people were up in the mountains we had we had no illusions that they were going to be moving to our our side at least during the you know I never thought the war was going to end the way that it did but at least during the period that we were there I we were chatting about this a little bit before but I I wanted to call out this one one point from the book um almost every marine who has ever fought in close combat can relay a stories of short round stray rounds misdirected shots accidental discharges and other chaos resulting from friendly fire mortars artillery and air strikes can easily wander from their intended targets sometimes due to map error and other at at other times because of human error historically friendly fire incidents during mobile close combat operations make up about 10% of casualties.
