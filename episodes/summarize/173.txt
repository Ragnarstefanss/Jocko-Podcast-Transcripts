I was just it's one of those days like it's bad as it was you know you knew just an inch this way I think we'd done the math before and it was like we came up with like eight inches or something I if the enemy just could move a bullet eight inches over the course of the day like move this bullet one inch this way move this bullet this way whatever they you know what of just killed everybody like when like guys got shot through the his camel back you know it first that it hit like he had a flare in the back there it had done that but that you just inch that Dylan who had the bullet skimmed between his armor and his his gear he moved that I mean like he says in there it definitely it definitely got to the point where like okay this is this is the day uh I don't know how everybody kind of just processed that um I know for me there was a point where I just set a quick prayer just asking God help my wife Miranda and our our son who at the time was a couple of days shy of three months old uh just make sure they're cool with with what's about to happen and then just go back to work and just you know taking it in little chunks it's it's too big to try and think of a week of over the course the day man the four US critical three other US wounded 2k AA about 13, 14, 15 afghan commandos interpreters wounded so you know in just terms of those numbers that's too much to deal with but if I just you know this is the worst thing and going on right now I'm going to deal with this and then come up for air look around that's now the worst thing so you know my wife has you know multiple full-time jobs you're trying to keep those kids you know where they need to be when they need to be there like with the secret service um I can't remember these exact day count but the last year I was like fully able to travel in for the extra level like a hundred and thirty days or something and you know at least well like the military time deployments like you're gonna leave in August and you know we let lower him down the hill and as we're kind of finishing that up like all of the amulatory commando and interpreter cash please they're kind of working their way down through all this as well set Howard and Matt Williams are kind of mentioned earlier like they came through right behind us just kicking off everybody else that had not got the message it was time to go or like CK who would you know been killed they got they got they got him off for us the the I can commando you know just I don't really have a great plan for we got him off yeah he's dropping bombs danger close dropping 2000 pounder I mean it's dropping the stuff and again you know why I'm talking about this as if I know who's what it looks like because I saw you can watch these videos and you can see the bombs hitting in massive hitting that castle and massive bombs hitting that castle and even even the bombs hit that castle they they do damage but that castle was massive and crazy you know we ended up through the course of the day one of our Afghans broke his leg the the wood framing on a building they got blown up broke his leg so we gotta deal with that you're getting just all the other wounds that are coming with those because this is massive debris is coming down on you guys from those danger close hits bomb drops and like debris is coming down on you guys because you guys are below it down a cliff right at at one point I don't remember exactly where in the sequence of events basically I could say we kind of had that wall on our left that went straight up and there was there was a a building there and they were getting in that and starting to shoot down at us and so that had to go away so Zach ended up calling in a strike hit that and you know the cancer fight is not like combat where you get to go punch somebody in the face or shoot somebody in the face and and have that like the the cancer fight is you know getting up and eating when you don't want to eat so last thing in the world you want to do or you got to work out well let's just go for a walk you know like just just those things I just want to you know have a moment to be able to anybody's being affected by that just say you know you're you're not alone and then you know we just unfortunately with it's a little cover as we had for anything like he couldn't take up space where we had cover so we we just kind of had him off to the side a little bit but exposed to the elements because you know unfortunately the living guys didn't have enough space so after checking on him I kind of go back through and obviously this entire time we're still getting shot at you can still feel those spults gone by you can still feel the dirt kicking up you know there's just everything so tight in there and so little space like I'm trying to kneel over these guys to do the best I can't for them and and as things are just falling on us trying to cover them as things you know just rocks are coming down as close as they're happening just trying to get yeah so I of course had heard about the review process that the Secretary defense had ordered never gave it a second thought just what's going about my day-to-day life I mean honestly I think like most soft guys like just to add a boy and here's your next mission that's all any of them expect or want or everything so in August of last year I get the first call on on my home phone because you know you still have a one it's part of that triple play package you know they get you with the home phone like I don't want a home phone they're like because more do not have it like the landline you know the FBI the secret service the DEA marshals air marshals everybody and very quickly on I really just liked the personality like came with the secret service the the attitude that the people had the dedication of the job the focus in a lot of ways you know like like like SF like you have super important mission sometimes you have all the resources you need sometimes you don't you're still gonna figure it out you're still gonna you're still gonna make it work I really liked that personality that came with it so while everybody showed interest in me I kind of focused there so like hey can you come to DC on a top of first because I'm getting them out of the water and like I felt like I had to apologize to them like the team was amazing that day the team did everything and a lot of these guys you know kept going for years and years after I got out like I don't know why I'm getting this and everybody's just hanging on that tiny little bit of the slope trying to not fall off and not get job and the the guys had been shot when they on that slope when they got shot are they pushing up a little bit were you were you somewhat safe in that shot were you in that spot were you somewhat protect your was the guys still getting I guess they weren't because you still guys were getting shot no guys were still still getting shot so we're basically you're just trying to use that tiny bit of an angle to minimize how much you can be shot at there was there was no place where you were safe on there at all if you kind of picture like from from from that little outcropping where we were if you're looking at the main village it was almost like like a like a hockey stick kind of in front of you as the way the mountain kind of wrapped around but he's fine the chest plate did a good job he's he's obviously gonna feel that for a few days so I go back keep trying to package up these guys a little bit more and we're just you know it's it's tough not to gloss over like minor wounds like you know this guy just got more sharp no ones like quick check you're fine move on one of our commandos at some point in all of this another one of our commandos got shot in the head and he dropped instantly and like well that dude's 100% dead and that's when they find about tumors just everywhere what they decided was the primary tumors about the size of a little bigger than a baseball on my left long um and by that point like I started thinking like with all the work that I would do like I'm just getting out of shape like my run times keep getting a little worse but at no point did I think that's what it was so we find out like through that MRI like I'd actually I had a fracture on my pelvis just had a baseball on my lung and a fracture on my pelvis still working and you know I'm not just you know saying this because I'm on your show like I I've been listening to your your podcasts for a long time I I've listened to many different episodes but there's one in particular where you you know you do the book views and uh the a man search for meaning you did that one I think like two or three months after I died diagnosed and that was I mean I like to think I'm a determined guy and like I can focus through stuff so yeah basically told Ryan you're good have a nice day and grab my stuff just start working towards the mountain our team team sergeant Scott Ford and one of the the weapons guys Matt Williams they started organizing a response force to get up there and start flexing a little more muscle up on the hill so there they're organizing that my focus is hey I need to go so you know hit the mountain start working start my way up the same terraced features that I talked about before and you know it is climbing hand over you know hand over hand your literally climbing get up to the next terrace figure out how much are we being shot out right now whereas it coming from where's the next place I can go up and just start working our way up as we went up you know the the other support LMA kind of got got with me and then then next day waiting on results I still flat to actually fly out to San Diego to do to do some more work and that afternoon after I got here he called and he was you know telling us well you have a few different use of word lesions you know once I tell you where is what he's like you got a few things going on your hip that I know normal I need you to go talk to this dock like as soon as you can he didn't even tell me like what the what that dock did but you feel like you kind of are Wolverine like you when you get you know how like me anyway when I get hurt we're like dinged up on like dang how long am I out now you know a week two weeks so I did as I just kind of started pouring that on the wound and then taking my fingers and shoving it into the wound because the wound was so small and three wounds are yeah not big so just started shoving that in there trying to get as much in as I could just repeating that process over and over until I felt like my head enough I don't know just it was just kind of gut call shoving fingers in your body to be like hopefully this will help and wrapped him up as well as I could and so while I'm doing this that's when the lead element started to get back towards us and they were gonna help us start to get these guys out of there and within moments minutes whatever it was of them getting getting there that's when we took our next American cashity John Walding been hit mother right rightly just below the knee basically stampitated is like right away I was hanging on by a little bit and so he meets us in there he's like you know how I run Miranda thanks for coming in we really appreciate it John Kelly wants to talk to you guys so of course Miranda and I are kind of looking at each other like trying to do like Hansi knows like in kind of what where we we landed is like I think I always felt like there was something I was supposed to do and that seemed like it's good a good thing to check a block with this as I could I could think of it's so many different like factors coming at like I there's not a day that goes by that I don't still miss the team so wish whenever I hear their out there like I wish I was there with them I wish I was you know still doing it you know like right now from the global war on terrorism we've been fighting for 17 straight years like green berets you know that's that's where my heart is like they've been just out there getting it on the entire time my it's mind boggling to me that I am the only living recipient right now representing that group Rob Robbie Miller who was in Alpha 33 was on the same deployment as me he here in the metal oven in January of 2008 probably taken the fight to the enemy but unfortunately he was he was the first green beret in this war and now in the second button the first two can actually get out there and share a share my story not so you can be like so is it like a gentleman's course boot camp scenario or for the most part you know coming from from the SF background like I don't know who we need to kick out you got to kick out somebody right just to make sure that everybody else who's here knows like you know it could happen to you yeah you know what else is crazy is I just you know like echo doesn't ever write anything down during these things and you made that statement like probably like 45 minutes ago but echo has just been sitting there thinking like dang but when I was talking my wife you know my wife has been talking to your wife and I said something along the lines of like oh you know what we'll talk about you know and using the secret to the secret service and my wife said in my wife's a Brit so she isn't like fully comprehend American government like an American does we go down back back to the infel point get them the helicopters leave wind in a planning it's some fire base I don't even know where it was we don't know if we're going back there's another SF team there we still got a lot of commandos so we're like back in the game are we gonna go I linked up with the the the medical support that was there refit my bag got got everything ready to go again like we were gonna go right back yeah my wife and son moved out there right away we bought a house you know while I take me to live there I was off a training for several months and then I joined them as soon as I finished up and I spent basically the next four years in Phoenix from May 2010 to May 2014 doing whatever financial crime or so financial crime includes what you have you know you credit card fraud you're counterfitting I need to get your number because credit card fraud people are all about you know coming after me it's like open access and that's what and when I talk to people like like yes I'm still good for my call I'm gonna run out of battery though if you keep calling me the check if my good for my my call or not so a little while later I boss calls back again and he's like your call is canceled like why are you cancel my call and you know just trying to run through all the scenarios you're had like what why are you doing anything with this
