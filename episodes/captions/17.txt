[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 17 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
[00:00:07] It's been ten years since April 2nd 2006. Ten years since those of us in 4th
[00:00:17] Platoon huddled around the radio outside of an Iraqi army post near Camp Romadi trying
[00:00:23] to make sense of the confused and uncertain radio traffic of the exos calm and firm voice
[00:00:31] from the COC trying to determine what truck had been hit and who was missing.
[00:00:39] Ten years since we drove the road back towards the Gov Center with fear in our minds and
[00:00:45] hate in our hearts knowing we had lost close friends but not yet sure of the names.
[00:00:54] Ten years since I met my platoon commander on the dark and steps of the Gov Center as
[00:01:00] he came down from the COC and confirmed which truck it had been and when I pressed for
[00:01:06] who was gone he simply said all of them.
[00:01:13] He hadn't yet learned that one guy who was a fucking hard ass who wasn't going to let death
[00:01:20] take another marine that day and whose recovery has been an inspiration to all those
[00:01:25] men who know him.
[00:01:29] Ten years since I did my best to pass the word to my team with steadfastness but repeating
[00:01:37] all of them revealing me for the twenty year one year old I was through the tears I was
[00:01:45] trying to hold back.
[00:01:49] Ten years of trying to figure out what their sacrifice meant of shifting views on what
[00:01:55] it was all for in the end.
[00:01:58] That is something that is still a struggle but I've found solace and purpose in these
[00:02:05] facts.
[00:02:09] Staff Sergeant Eric McIntosh, Corporal Scott Procopio, Lance Corporal Kun, Young Kim and
[00:02:20] Hospital Men Giovanni Padilla were men who chose to be part of something bigger than
[00:02:27] themselves.
[00:02:28] Men who chose to enter a profession of crushingly hard work sacrifice and danger all
[00:02:34] for the simple purpose of protecting the men around them.
[00:02:39] Staff Sergeant Mack was the epitome of a fighting marine, a stud who exuded proficiency
[00:02:44] and professionalism, were also being humorous and approachable.
[00:02:50] Procopio is without a doubt when the finest men I've ever had the fortune of meeting,
[00:02:55] a beast of a marine who drove all around him with his enthusiasm and good nature.
[00:03:01] While we were peers, I looked up to him and his natural leadership.
[00:03:06] I still do.
[00:03:09] Kim had a quiet reliability about him.
[00:03:12] Unlike the usual loud, grigiriousness that people tend to associate with grunts, he
[00:03:17] was low key and dependable.
[00:03:20] And for some reason I can still see the way a smile would creep over his face when stupid
[00:03:25] shit was going on and he'd laugh in a way that made it seem like he was seeing a deeper
[00:03:30] joke that you didn't get yet.
[00:03:35] Doc Padillo was new to the company and my memories of him are vague, but the men who knew
[00:03:40] him better describe a young corpsman who was enthusiastic about his job.
[00:03:47] The funny thing with corpsman is that sometimes you don't need to know much to judge their
[00:03:52] character besides the fact that these young men volunteered for one specific duty.
[00:03:59] To save the lives of their marines in combat, a more honorable calling is hard to find.
[00:04:09] It's easy for today to be dark to get sucked into the trap of loss, regret, depression,
[00:04:16] and anger.
[00:04:19] It's easy to drown it in liquor under the pretence of having one for the boys.
[00:04:26] This morning as we prepare ourselves to face the tenth of these days, we think of Scott
[00:04:32] and his booming laugh.
[00:04:35] He wouldn't want us sitting around morning like saps, wasting our precious days, burdened
[00:04:40] with his death, like tormented widows out of some 19th century romance fiction.
[00:04:48] He'd remind us that we all joined up for the same reasons.
[00:04:53] We are infantry marines.
[00:04:56] We wanted to fight to energetically meet the enemy in battle and crush him.
[00:05:01] To serve beside men with whom we would build a bond stronger than most will ever know.
[00:05:09] While the politics are complicated and the outcomes unclear, one thing is certain.
[00:05:18] Their sacrifice was not in vain.
[00:05:23] It was the sacrifice that warriors make for each other.
[00:05:27] April 2nd is a day that defines us now, brings us together as brothers.
[00:05:34] It is a day of remembrance and reflection.
[00:05:38] A day that gives us reason to look at our lives and say, look, you son of a bitch.
[00:05:46] This is why you have to live life to the fullest.
[00:05:49] This is why you must fight every day to be a better man.
[00:05:55] And then we must just remember that Scott, Procopio, would call you a pussy for doing the
[00:06:03] opposite.
[00:06:07] For five jins, we will never forget you.
[00:06:22] So that was a post that someone forwarded to me that was on bread.
[00:06:30] It was from an anonymous marine.
[00:06:32] Obviously, this marine was from the three eight marines who we served with in Ramadi, who
[00:06:39] were just outstanding warriors.
[00:06:45] I thought that that tribute not only to the fallen, but also a form of council to his fellow
[00:06:58] marines.
[00:07:00] I just thought that that was an amazing piece of writing and I wanted to share it with everyone.
[00:07:10] April 2nd.
[00:07:15] Now speaking of Ramadi, which, you know, just like this marine, it's something that I think
[00:07:26] about all the time and something that I refer back to a couple of podcasts ago, we talked
[00:07:31] about the band of brothers, the first of the 506, who we also served with in Ramadi.
[00:07:39] And it is a truly hallowed unit.
[00:07:45] And if you've seen the HBO miniseries band of brothers, just a fantastic memorial and representation
[00:07:55] of these American fighting men.
[00:07:59] And the leader of that group, or one of the leaders of easy company and then of the
[00:08:05] battalion, was a guy by the name of Major Dick Winners.
[00:08:11] And he wrote after his, after he came famous, really, from the first book by Stephen
[00:08:22] Ambrose called Band of Brothers and then the miniseries came out, called Band of Brothers.
[00:08:29] He wrote a book, which is called Beyond Band of Brothers, the warm memoirs of Major Dick
[00:08:40] Winners.
[00:08:49] And I got to this book basically because I was going to do Band of Brothers, this Stephen
[00:08:54] Ambrose.
[00:08:55] But as everybody knows, or if you don't know, I like to get the source material from the
[00:09:00] people that were there.
[00:09:02] Stephen Ambrose is a historian.
[00:09:04] And so I identified this book as I was researching more deeply into Band of Brothers.
[00:09:11] I very quickly found this book, ordered it.
[00:09:14] And yeah, there's no doubt.
[00:09:18] So let me kick this off.
[00:09:28] As Battalion operations officer, Hester pointed to where an enemy machine gun was located
[00:09:33] in approximately where a four gun battery of 105s was situated.
[00:09:38] That was all he knew.
[00:09:40] Captain Hester turned to me and said, there's fire along that hedge road there.
[00:09:45] Take care of it.
[00:09:47] That was the sum of my orders.
[00:09:49] No detailed battle plan, no intelligence summary, nothing but a specific task to be accomplished
[00:09:54] without delay.
[00:09:57] Easy company's mission was to silence the battery.
[00:10:03] We talk about the basic principles of combat.
[00:10:05] One of them is simple, clear concise.
[00:10:07] There you go.
[00:10:08] That's your orders.
[00:10:09] There's fire along that hedge road.
[00:10:11] Take care of it.
[00:10:12] And this is also, obviously, an unbelievable example of decentralized command.
[00:10:17] You go solve this problem.
[00:10:19] And his response is I got it.
[00:10:22] Back to the book, conducting a mental estimate of the situation I viewed any infantry
[00:10:27] assault on the battery as a high risk opportunity since our air forces had failed to destroy
[00:10:31] the artillery battery in the preliminary bombardment prior to the seaborn invasion.
[00:10:37] Our key would be initiative and immediate appraisal of the situation, skillful use of the terrain
[00:10:43] and our ability to destroy one gun at a time.
[00:10:48] So you'll notice, he's going to, as soon as he knows that there's multiple guns, what
[00:10:52] does he decide to do?
[00:10:54] One gun at a time, solve one problem at a time.
[00:10:57] Little something we like to call a prioriortized and execute.
[00:11:02] The first thing I did was have everybody drop all equipment except ammunition and grenades.
[00:11:07] So that was all we would need if things went from good to bad.
[00:11:11] To get rid of the things you don't need.
[00:11:13] Focus on this one task that we've got right now.
[00:11:15] It's another prioritized and execute orger right there.
[00:11:19] While the non-commissioned officers prepared the men for the assault, I conducted a hasty
[00:11:23] reconnaissance of the enemy position.
[00:11:26] A leader gains an advantage in combat if he's able to appraise the terrain and the situation
[00:11:30] quickly and correctly.
[00:11:33] Crawling along the hedge road, I moved to a position where I could get a better view of the
[00:11:36] enemy position.
[00:11:37] The guns appear to be set in the trench and the head road covered by a machine gun
[00:11:42] fire from across an open pasture.
[00:11:44] The battery was firing directly down, causeway number two in the direction of Utah Beach
[00:11:49] where the initial waves of the fourth infantry division were already landing.
[00:11:54] So you've got these German guns in an elevated position hammering Utah Beach where the fourth
[00:12:01] infantry division is trying to land right now.
[00:12:03] It's a nightmare.
[00:12:05] It's anticipating that it would be too costly to conduct a frontal attack across an open
[00:12:10] field.
[00:12:11] I determined our chances of success would be greatly enhanced if we could hit the enemy
[00:12:16] on the flank and silence one gun at a time.
[00:12:21] Hit the enemy on the flank.
[00:12:24] Again, these are basic principles and I hate calling, I hate using the word basic, because
[00:12:29] it's fundamentals.
[00:12:30] It's nothing basic about it.
[00:12:32] It's basic, but it's beautiful.
[00:12:35] It's simplicity.
[00:12:39] Returning to the company, I assign specific missions to each man.
[00:12:44] So everybody knows what their task is going to be.
[00:12:47] First I placed one of easy companies to machine guns in a position where they could
[00:12:50] provide a covering fire as we move carefully into position.
[00:12:54] Cover and move.
[00:12:57] Next I divided our detachment into two units, one led by Lieutenant Buck Compton and the
[00:13:02] other remaining with me.
[00:13:06] Compton moved down one headrow with Sergeant Garnier and Malarke to get his close to the
[00:13:10] first gun in the battery as possible, while I led my unit down a parallel headrow.
[00:13:17] Compton also sent Sergeant Slipton and Rainy to conceal position to put flanking fire on
[00:13:23] the enemy while my detachment crawled across the open field to approach the gun first.
[00:13:29] Once you've got multiple covering move situations going on right now, and again to the
[00:13:34] military folks that are listening this, you could breeze through this description and miss
[00:13:40] how important that is, how important and what a great example of covering move this is,
[00:13:45] got to put down that cover fire, you got to put down that cover fire and that's why
[00:13:48] you got to bring them heavy weapons out there, bring those AWs out boys.
[00:13:52] Lots of them.
[00:13:56] In my group, back to the book, when my group consisting of Corporal Joe Toy, PFC Robert
[00:14:01] Pop-I-Win, and private Gerald the Rain from Regimental Headquarters, reached the hedge that
[00:14:07] led to the enemy position and we stopped.
[00:14:10] Here I placed a second machine gun to engage the first gun that was firing point blank
[00:14:13] at us.
[00:14:14] I gave the gun instructions and not to fire unless he saw a definite target so he would
[00:14:18] not give away his position.
[00:14:20] Then we worked our way up to Compton's headrow.
[00:14:22] Here I spotted a German helmet and squeezed off two rounds.
[00:14:26] Later I found a pool of blood at this position, but no Jerry.
[00:14:30] Jerry's term for German.
[00:14:33] Next I sent Compton with two men along the hedge to throw a hand grenades at the enemy
[00:14:36] position while the rest of us supported him with covering fire.
[00:14:40] These guys don't do anything without covering fire.
[00:14:45] I fired occasionally to fill spots when there was a low in the covering fire due to putting
[00:14:50] in new clips.
[00:14:52] Compton took too long getting his detachment into position and we spent more ammunition
[00:14:56] than we should have, but in return we received no enemy fire.
[00:15:00] That covering fire, even though it took too long, but they didn't receive any enemy
[00:15:05] fire because they were laying down that fire.
[00:15:07] They were laying down that covering fire.
[00:15:10] Just as Compton was ready to hurl his grenades, I started across the field with the rest
[00:15:14] of the assault team.
[00:15:16] So that what we jumped in the position together as the grenades exploded.
[00:15:20] And simultaneously we heard additional grenades at the next position.
[00:15:24] In return we received substantial smaller arms fire and grenades from the enemy.
[00:15:29] As we approached the first gun, Papai win was hitting the butt and fell down in the trench.
[00:15:35] Rather than complaining that he was hit, he apologized.
[00:15:39] I'm sorry Lieutenant, I goofed, I goofed, I'm sorry.
[00:15:45] My God, it's beautiful when you think of a guy who is so dedicated to his company that
[00:15:49] he apologizes for getting hit.
[00:15:52] Now he was a soldier hit by enemy fire in Normandy on D Day behind German lines.
[00:15:59] And he's more upset that he'd let his buddies down than he was concerned with his own injury.
[00:16:05] Papai's action.
[00:16:07] Papai's actions spoke for all of us.
[00:16:11] Now I'm fast-forwarding a little bit to get these guns taken down.
[00:16:18] With the entire battery now destroyed, we now withdrew because the machine gun fire that
[00:16:24] we were receiving from the matterhouse and other positions remained intense.
[00:16:28] I pulled our own machine guns out first, then the rifleman.
[00:16:32] I was last to leave, and as I was leaving, I took a final look down the trench, and there
[00:16:37] was one wounded Jerry trying to put a machine gun onto into operation.
[00:16:42] I drilled him through the head.
[00:16:44] On our way back, I came across warn officer, J.G. Andrew Hill, who had been killed working
[00:16:49] his way up to help us.
[00:16:52] In all, we had suffered four dead, six wounded, and we had inflicted 15 dead and 12 captured
[00:16:58] enemy.
[00:17:00] German forces in the vicinity of the battery had outnumbered about 50.
[00:17:04] About three hours passed since I had received the order to dispose of the battery.
[00:17:11] And then, so they take care of that, they conduct some other smaller operations, and then
[00:17:16] it goes to the end of D-Day.
[00:17:21] At long last D-Day was over, our success had been to superb leadership at all levels, and
[00:17:29] the training we had experienced prior to the invasion.
[00:17:32] Add luck to the equation, an easy company comprised of formidable team.
[00:17:38] In reflection, we were highly charged.
[00:17:41] We knew what to do, and we conducted ourselves as part of a well-oiled machine.
[00:17:47] Because we were so intimate with each other, I knew the strengths of each of my troopers.
[00:17:52] This is something that he refers back to a lot, was really understanding his men, what
[00:17:59] they were like, what drove them, what their strengths and weaknesses were, so he could
[00:18:02] put them in the correct positions.
[00:18:07] Being allowed us a few minutes of quiet reflection.
[00:18:11] With our outposts in place, I stretched out to catch a few hours of sleep, even though
[00:18:16] the rattle of German small arms fire continued throughout the night.
[00:18:22] Before I dosed off, I did not forget to get on my knees and thank God for helping me
[00:18:27] live through this day, and to ask his help on D-Plus One.
[00:18:33] I would live this war one day at a time, and I promised myself that if I survived,
[00:18:38] I would find a small farm somewhere in Pennsylvania countryside and spend the remainder
[00:18:43] of my life in quiet and peace.
[00:18:54] Now, as you hear about Dick Winners, and that's, I wanted to cover at least one
[00:19:02] engagement, one actual engagement, and that's one of them, so you can kind of see the methodology,
[00:19:08] the principles that he's putting into action.
[00:19:11] But I want to concentrate not so much on the action now, but more on the leadership,
[00:19:16] the leadership pieces of it.
[00:19:18] Although there's still, I still do talk about some of the combat situations that they
[00:19:23] get into, because they were in a war.
[00:19:29] And I want to check in going back a little bit from where he came from, what his mindset,
[00:19:34] what developed it, and he says this, I had a wonderful mother, very conservative.
[00:19:42] She came from a men and night family, but never converted to that faith.
[00:19:46] Honesty and discipline were driven into my head from day one.
[00:19:55] At some point, I'm just going to have to stop like even accenting these things.
[00:20:00] These common themes that are just run through these leaders, not surprisingly, mother was
[00:20:10] undoubtedly one of the most influential people in my life.
[00:20:14] A mother takes a child, she nurtures him, she instills discipline, and she teaches respect.
[00:20:21] My mother was the first one up every morning.
[00:20:27] She prepared breakfast for my sister and in me, and she was the last one to bed every
[00:20:32] evening.
[00:20:35] In many respects, she was the ideal company commander.
[00:20:39] And subconsciously, I'm sure I patterned my own leadership abilities on this remarkable
[00:20:44] woman.
[00:20:47] So it's interesting, all he talked about was that she was the first one to work, and
[00:20:52] she was the last one to leave work, meaning she was the first one up in the morning,
[00:20:55] and she was the last one to leave.
[00:20:57] And with that statement alone, he said that she's the ideal company commander.
[00:21:02] Now, for those of you that aren't the military, your company commander is there's several
[00:21:07] companies in a battalion, there could be three, maybe four, maybe even five, depending on
[00:21:11] the task organization.
[00:21:12] But it's a hundred, maybe 150 guys generally in a company.
[00:21:17] So he's saying that this, that his mom would be an ideal company commander.
[00:21:23] Why?
[00:21:24] Because she wakes up early and has a lot of discipline.
[00:21:29] Newsflash.
[00:21:32] Now, speaking of, yeah, I won't read any more actions.
[00:21:37] Here's another action.
[00:21:39] I positioned men on both sides of the road and prepared to move out in order to secure
[00:21:44] the intersection.
[00:21:45] Here they are on a move, they're got to secure an intersection.
[00:21:49] Lieutenant Wells led first platoon at the head of the company, column.
[00:21:53] Precisely on schedule, I hollowed Wells move out.
[00:21:57] Just as the attack started, a German machine gun located in a building at the foot of the
[00:22:01] hill started to fire up the road.
[00:22:03] The German gun crew is in perfect position at the perfect time to wipe out our entire
[00:22:09] attack.
[00:22:11] On the left hand side of the road, Wells pushed six men towards the intersection.
[00:22:17] They went straight at that intersection and the enemy machine gun.
[00:22:22] The enemy fire, however, was very effective.
[00:22:25] Our men on both sides of the road kept low profiles and the ditches, heads down and they
[00:22:30] frozen place, leaving Wells and his six men assaulting the intersection alone.
[00:22:36] Using my rear, Colonel Strayer and his staff, including Captain Hester and Nixon, could
[00:22:42] see what was happening.
[00:22:44] They in turn were hollowing at me, get them moving, winners get them moving.
[00:22:49] I struggled out of my harness to rid myself of excess equipment so that I could run.
[00:22:55] Since it was obvious what needed to be done.
[00:22:58] So guess what, people aren't moving, people aren't taking action and it's obvious to
[00:23:02] him what needs to be done.
[00:23:04] Looking at the middle of the column on the right hand side of the road, I hollowed, move
[00:23:08] out, move out.
[00:23:09] This did no good.
[00:23:10] Everyone had his heads down.
[00:23:13] This was the one and only time in the war that I really blew my top and physically kicked
[00:23:19] ass.
[00:23:20] I came out of that ditch with only my M1 in hand and haulering.
[00:23:24] I ran to the head of the column, kicked ass on the left side of the road, then ran to the
[00:23:28] right side of the road, back and forth, screaming at my top of my voice, get going.
[00:23:33] I will never forget the surprise and fear on those faces looking up at me.
[00:23:37] With me running around on the road like a wild man, the machine gunner seemed to zero in
[00:23:41] on me.
[00:23:42] I was a wide open target.
[00:23:44] The bullet snapped by and glanced off the road all around me.
[00:23:49] For a short time, I had the feeling of being blessed.
[00:23:54] That feeling didn't last too long for hours to find out in a few minutes that I wasn't
[00:23:57] so blessed.
[00:24:03] And the reason I highlighted that section right there, because in the next literally the next
[00:24:07] page in the book, you get this idea, and again, this is the idea that people have of military
[00:24:13] leaders.
[00:24:14] Is that they're these hard ass guys and these kick ass guys that are running around
[00:24:18] and yelling like what I just read.
[00:24:22] I wanted to highlight that because now we fast forward one page in the book.
[00:24:30] And taking the intersection, easy companies sustain ten casualties.
[00:24:35] Among our wounded were Sergeant Lippden, Ed Tipper, and Burr Smith.
[00:24:40] Another casualty was Private Albert Belive, who was in the aid station sitting with his
[00:24:46] back against the wall when I entered to have my wound cleaned, because by the way, major
[00:24:52] winners got hit.
[00:24:54] And so he's in there getting his wound cleaned.
[00:24:57] Now he's looking at Private Blife, and he says here, I did not notice any wounds.
[00:25:03] So I asked how are you doing, Blife?
[00:25:06] I can't see, I can't see he replied.
[00:25:10] I remember trying to comfort him by saying it's okay, Blife, relax, they'll have you out
[00:25:15] of your soon and they'll send you back to England.
[00:25:19] As I started to move away, Blife stood up suddenly saying, I'm okay, I'm okay, I can
[00:25:24] see now.
[00:25:28] As soon as Blife regained his vision, he immediately returned to duty.
[00:25:32] If you think about that for a minute, that boy had been paralyzed by fear.
[00:25:37] Yet he had the guts and dedication to stick to his buddies in easy company.
[00:25:41] As soon as he relaxed and pulled himself together, he returned to the front, rather than
[00:25:45] taking the easy way out, with an evacuation.
[00:25:50] Sometimes all a soldier needed was a calm voice reassuring him that everything was fine.
[00:25:58] In Blife's case, he rejoined the company and was wounded in action during the upcoming
[00:26:03] fight.
[00:26:05] After World War II, he served in the 187th Airborne Regiment in the Korean War where
[00:26:10] he was awarded a silver star and the bronze star.
[00:26:14] By the time he retired from military service, Blife was a company first sergeant.
[00:26:20] So, the contrast there is that, instead of pulling a general George Patton and slapping
[00:26:28] the guy around and saying, you're not wounded, he realized what he needed to do, which was
[00:26:31] just comfort the guy.
[00:26:32] Say, hey, listen, everything's okay.
[00:26:33] We'll get you on a plane, we'll get you back to England, just take it easy.
[00:26:39] Here's a section that I'm just going to jump too quickly when he's talking about the confusion
[00:26:45] getting in the confusion getting our men into position was as bad as we were to ever see.
[00:26:52] One time I found easy company troops firing into troops of another battalion.
[00:26:57] Later we had some tanks show up for support and they began firing into our own mind.
[00:27:06] So that's Blue On Blue, it's Fratur side and we talk about it in our book and it's one
[00:27:14] of those things that they usually don't show it.
[00:27:18] They usually don't portray it because it's hard to believe that things can get that confusing,
[00:27:24] but they do.
[00:27:26] And it goes all the way back.
[00:27:30] And clear example right there.
[00:27:36] Now we're going back to Blife and this is an interesting commentary on training.
[00:27:42] And one of our daylight patrols led by Sergeant Garnier, Blife was point man when he spotted
[00:27:48] a German sniper in a tree.
[00:27:52] Just as he did in training, he automatically said bang, bang instead of dropping to the side
[00:27:58] of the road and putting his rifle on the sniper.
[00:28:02] So if you can imagine you're back in America or when they were doing their pre-attack training
[00:28:08] in England and they weren't using real bullets, so they're out on a patrol and if they
[00:28:12] saw something, they'd go bang, bang.
[00:28:14] Well, that's literally what the guy did.
[00:28:18] The German reacted first and shot Blife through the collarbone, the rest of the patrol,
[00:28:23] recovered Blife and then withdrew to easy lines.
[00:28:28] So again, military people that are listening, law enforcement, you train how you fight,
[00:28:36] and you fight how you train.
[00:28:38] So you just gotta keep that in mind all the time.
[00:28:40] If you're giving yourself some kind of a training scar by doing something like a lip gun,
[00:28:46] we actually did this in the sealed team.
[00:28:47] Lip gun, that's what we call it, it's embarrassing.
[00:28:50] In my early days, that's what we want to have a choice.
[00:28:52] Like what you make sound like a band.
[00:28:53] Like bang, bang, yeah, you're mouth.
[00:28:55] Yeah.
[00:28:56] And thankfully now they have unbelievable good systems, the paintball type systems that go in
[00:29:03] our real guns, the laser tag type systems, so we don't have to use lip guns.
[00:29:14] Back to the book, next sector.
[00:29:18] Success breeds confidence and easy company success and normandy instilled the confidence
[00:29:23] that they would need to succeed and live to fight another day.
[00:29:27] At the same time, I could not help but think that had I trained the men harder.
[00:29:35] If I had done a better job, maybe more of my men would have come home.
[00:29:42] That's something a leader is always going to be thinking, always going to be thinking that.
[00:29:47] What could we have done better?
[00:29:48] What could I have done better?
[00:29:52] Now they get back to England, they're taking a break, they get pulled off the line,
[00:29:57] and he's back in Al, and Aldborn.
[00:30:00] He's just talking about he's sort of reflecting back on his initial push into Europe.
[00:30:10] You know you got guys there out drinking and doing whatever they're doing, and he says,
[00:30:15] ask for myself, I relaxed the best I could.
[00:30:19] Combat had made me tense, particularly since my decisions now meant life or death to the
[00:30:24] members of my command.
[00:30:28] Commanding soldiers and combat requires a personal detachment from the men themselves.
[00:30:34] In a sense, command is the loneliest job in the world.
[00:30:40] Looking at myself in the mirror, I could see how much I had changed, I could sense it.
[00:30:47] Another thing that affected me was the importance of discipline.
[00:30:52] The necessity of instilling discipline to my troops and getting the job done in combat.
[00:31:03] In an attempt to escape the tension that combat had caused, I developed a heavier than
[00:31:08] usual exercise regimen, and I attended church on a regular basis.
[00:31:14] There were only a few days that I didn't run two to three miles, two 80 pushups, 60
[00:31:19] situps on a foot locker, that a couple of splits and some leg and trunk exercises after
[00:31:23] the day's work was over.
[00:31:26] As a result, I kept in pretty good shape, not what I'd call wrestling shape, but good
[00:31:30] enough for army work.
[00:31:33] Physical activity kept me mentally alert, built my endurance, and kept me supple.
[00:31:46] You got to do it.
[00:31:48] You got to have that discipline and you got to work out.
[00:31:50] You got to do it every day.
[00:31:52] It's that important.
[00:31:55] Yeah, see how I mentioned how it kept him mentally sharp.
[00:31:58] It absolutely does.
[00:31:59] Yeah, it's it that before that's one of the few things that you can do that affects everything
[00:32:05] and everything in life.
[00:32:07] You are correct.
[00:32:08] I think people a lot of time in regards to exercise people think, well, exercise, that's
[00:32:13] for a certain kind of person.
[00:32:14] You know, maybe a fitness person or something like that.
[00:32:17] That's for a dumb joke, right?
[00:32:19] I'm a smart person.
[00:32:20] I'm not going to exercise long answer.
[00:32:22] Yeah, I think nowadays people are more hip to it for sure, but do you say hip?
[00:32:26] Hitman, down, down with the cause, the new stuff.
[00:32:30] Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:31] But yeah, it is interesting how these leaders back then, they knew that.
[00:32:37] Yep, even though there's been no, even though at that time there's been no scientific
[00:32:41] study, their scientific study is now that proved it.
[00:32:44] He didn't know that.
[00:32:45] He just knew it.
[00:32:46] Yeah, he felt that he lived it.
[00:32:47] Now, they're in a position now, again, I'm just fast forward.
[00:32:56] And even though I said I wasn't going to cover too much in the combat, I'm covering
[00:32:59] the combat.
[00:33:00] Because the combat is what puts these people in these leadership positions.
[00:33:06] Combat is the ultimate teacher, the harshest teacher, and the teachers you lessons that you
[00:33:11] do not forget.
[00:33:15] So they're around this village of foi, which is a village that was held by the Germans
[00:33:20] and they'd been waiting.
[00:33:22] And they'd been a while.
[00:33:27] And here's winners talking about, here's winners talking about his troops.
[00:33:34] They were now completely exhausted.
[00:33:38] They had had no hot food, little sleep, no rest, constant tension, and the pressure of
[00:33:43] combat.
[00:33:46] The worst time was night when temperatures plummeted and fog covered the battlefield until
[00:33:51] mid-delate morning.
[00:33:53] The uncertainty of what lay just yards ahead in the next treeline was sufficient to break
[00:33:59] ordinary men.
[00:34:01] Not surprisingly, the men became physically exhausted.
[00:34:07] Physical exhaustion leads to mental exhaustion, which in turn causes men to lose discipline.
[00:34:13] Laws of self-discipline then produces combat fatigue.
[00:34:20] Self-discipline keeps a soldier doing his job.
[00:34:25] Without it, he loses his pride, and he loses the importance of self-respecting the
[00:34:29] eyes of his fellow soldiers.
[00:34:32] It is pride that keeps a soldier going and keeps him in the fight.
[00:34:38] This is what I feared I would lose, the loss of will to measure up to my men.
[00:34:45] After seeing others break down, you wondered who is next, and you started taking a hard look
[00:34:50] at yourself.
[00:34:54] I often wondered why I didn't break under the strain of combat.
[00:35:02] One factor undoubtedly lay in the fact that my battalion headquarters lay 75 yards behind
[00:35:07] the Ford Foxholes.
[00:35:10] No longer was I under enemy observation.
[00:35:14] Consequently, I was able to concentrate on my duties without fear of enemy small arms
[00:35:18] fire.
[00:35:20] Another factor was undoubtedly my physical conditioning.
[00:35:25] I don't think there was a man in the battalion who was in better physical shape than I
[00:35:28] was.
[00:35:30] My responsibility to ensure the safety of the soldiers also hardened me to cope with the daily
[00:35:35] stress of combat.
[00:35:41] One last observation on combat fatigue.
[00:35:45] When you see a man break, he usually slams his helmet down and messes up his hair.
[00:35:50] I don't know if it's conscious or unconscious, but a soldier goes to his head and massages
[00:35:55] his head, shakes it, and then he's gone.
[00:35:59] You can talk to him all you want, but he cannot hear you.
[00:36:02] When he reaches that point, the best thing for everybody is just to let him take a walk.
[00:36:08] Combat exhaustion occurs instantaneously.
[00:36:11] You don't plan to become a combat fatigue casualty.
[00:36:16] How do you prevent combat fatigue?
[00:36:19] You talk to your troops and make some excuse to pull a soldier off the front line.
[00:36:24] Of course pulling a soldier off the front line increases the stress of those who remain,
[00:36:29] but is a necessary trade-off.
[00:36:31] I often asked a soldier who might saw on the verge of a breakdown, how about coming back
[00:36:37] with me to the CP to help out for a couple of days?
[00:36:40] In this manner, you invent a reason for pulling a guy from the line without damaging his
[00:36:45] psyche.
[00:36:46] So, bunch of stuff there on combat fatigue.
[00:36:53] I'm not saying that you're going to see combat fatigue in the civilian world.
[00:36:58] But you do see people get stressed out in business.
[00:37:02] I thought that that common about people messing up their hair and grabbing their head.
[00:37:08] That's a really good indicator of when people are breaking.
[00:37:14] I'll tell you one of the things, this is something that we talk about of the book, as
[00:37:18] well as for us, the guys that had the most resistance to combat fatigue with a
[00:37:28] guy that were most inturately involved in the planning of the operations.
[00:37:35] They felt like they had control.
[00:37:37] Unfortunately, we didn't know this.
[00:37:39] We had guys that weren't involved, maybe they were new guys, or they just weren't that
[00:37:44] involved in the planning or whatever.
[00:37:46] All they were getting told was like, hey, get your gear on.
[00:37:48] You're going out again.
[00:37:49] Come back from that operation.
[00:37:50] Hey, get your gear on.
[00:37:51] Come back from that operation.
[00:37:52] Hey, get your gear on.
[00:37:53] You're going out again.
[00:37:55] Those guys that didn't really get involved in the planning, it was harder for them because
[00:37:58] they didn't feel like they had any control.
[00:38:00] And they didn't see the risk mitigation that was happening.
[00:38:02] And they didn't understand the strategy well enough.
[00:38:04] Why?
[00:38:05] Because I didn't tell them, my fault.
[00:38:06] You know, I should have been more engaged than I should have explained to them the impact
[00:38:09] that they were having.
[00:38:10] I should have explained to them the overall strategic picture.
[00:38:13] And I tried to do that.
[00:38:14] And I thought I did it, but I didn't do well enough.
[00:38:17] And those are the guys that definitely were the most stressed out.
[00:38:22] So leaders out there, it's just another reason.
[00:38:25] It's another reason to tell people why they're doing what they're doing and get them involved
[00:38:31] in the planning and get them ownership of the planning.
[00:38:34] So they feel like they have some control over it.
[00:38:37] Interesting.
[00:38:38] Oh, they mentioned how they dealt with that when they'd pull them off the line, right?
[00:38:42] But they wouldn't just be like straight up straight.
[00:38:45] Don't, hey, you're messing up.
[00:38:46] Get off the line.
[00:38:47] No.
[00:38:48] It was like they pulled them off the line in a way that wouldn't, wouldn't mess them up.
[00:38:52] Do we need you to take care of the supply issue?
[00:38:54] Yeah.
[00:38:55] Go back there for me and get this figured out.
[00:38:56] Yeah.
[00:38:57] Okay, I'll do it.
[00:38:58] Give them a break, give them a rest.
[00:39:00] This is something hack worth talked about too.
[00:39:01] I mean, hack worth says, you know, about face, you know, he talks about he just says,
[00:39:05] hey, everyone's got a cup of certain size cup.
[00:39:08] Some people have a bigger cup than others, but when the cup gets filled up, that's it.
[00:39:12] They're done.
[00:39:13] And if you let the cup get filled up and overflow, then they're done forever.
[00:39:16] But if you can catch it beforehand, they can go back a little bit and drain their cup out.
[00:39:19] That's exactly what you talk about when you say manipulation.
[00:39:23] All right.
[00:39:24] You tell them just in a kind of a gingerly kind of way.
[00:39:28] You know, make them signed on to the whole situation.
[00:39:31] Yeah.
[00:39:32] Yeah, no doubt about it.
[00:39:38] This is going back to his discipline.
[00:39:42] My routine was to shave every morning and then to inspect the line.
[00:39:48] And in retrospect, shaving in the bitter cold was pretty ridiculous.
[00:39:52] But the practice had originated with one of my first meetings with Colonel Sink.
[00:39:57] At Tacoa, Sink had required us to shave every morning.
[00:40:01] He said, you shave every morning for the men.
[00:40:04] And if you want to, shave every evening for the women.
[00:40:07] But that's up to you.
[00:40:09] But I want you to said an example.
[00:40:13] He was absolutely right.
[00:40:15] I remember one morning when we prepared for our attack on foi.
[00:40:19] I got up in the middle of the night to shave before getting something to eat.
[00:40:23] In the process, I cut myself up pretty badly.
[00:40:26] I must have looked like hell.
[00:40:29] When Colonel Sink arrived to check on us before the attack commenced, he took one look
[00:40:33] at me and had a huge smile on his face.
[00:40:36] I later, I realized later that he was laughing at me for shaving on that bitterly cold
[00:40:41] morning.
[00:40:42] But that was one of the things I did to set an example for the men.
[00:40:46] Shave in the morning and once in a while, I would strip to the waist and give myself a French
[00:40:50] wash, a routine that caught everyone's attention.
[00:40:54] I did this for one reason and one reason only to get the men's attention and to let them
[00:41:00] know that I was going to be around for a while and this wasn't as bad as they thought
[00:41:04] it was going to be.
[00:41:06] Make the best of it.
[00:41:11] And what I like about that is his total awareness of the impact that he's having on his
[00:41:18] men.
[00:41:19] He knows that they are watching them and if you're in a leadership position, you've got to
[00:41:22] recognize that people are watching you.
[00:41:25] Parents.
[00:41:26] Yeah.
[00:41:27] If you're a parent, you've got to realize that person that you're leading called your child,
[00:41:31] they're watching you.
[00:41:32] It's more critical than most of the time anyway, than what you say.
[00:41:37] And people will make this excuse saying that they say, hey, do what I say, not what I
[00:41:42] do.
[00:41:43] Meanwhile, you're doing all this stuff.
[00:41:44] That's not how they're going to be like, oh, that's just something you say.
[00:41:48] Meanwhile, this is how you do it.
[00:41:50] Apparently, mom and dad are doing it this way.
[00:41:53] That's the way it's done.
[00:41:54] We're going to do this.
[00:41:55] Yeah.
[00:41:56] You've got to do the right thing and people are watching you when you're in a leadership
[00:42:03] position, you are being watched, you are being emulated.
[00:42:09] Your emotions are being mimicked.
[00:42:10] You don't know that.
[00:42:11] You might not sense that, but your emotions are being mimicked.
[00:42:16] You get into a panic mode.
[00:42:17] You're going to have a bunch of people panicking.
[00:42:22] You stay calm.
[00:42:24] Your people are going to stay calm.
[00:42:26] You get crazy.
[00:42:27] Your people are going to go crazy.
[00:42:28] Your people are watching you so set the good example.
[00:42:31] And one of the premier examples he's setting is he's maintaining the discipline.
[00:42:39] Now this is actually section.
[00:42:40] I don't, it's, it's very interesting because we had, I had made a comment on the podcast
[00:42:49] about, hey, what do you do?
[00:42:50] Someone asked, what do you do if you get told to do something and you don't believe
[00:42:54] in it.
[00:42:55] Right.
[00:42:56] And you know, I went through a big gray area and said, look, there's some gray area
[00:43:00] there.
[00:43:01] And if it's just something small that you can ask to do and you just, if you decide
[00:43:05] you're going to lay down the wall right now and bang your fist on the table and say, I'm
[00:43:08] not going to do that.
[00:43:09] Well, then you're going to get fired.
[00:43:12] And now someone else is going to have to come in there and do that thing that you've
[00:43:15] been asked to do.
[00:43:16] And I had one person on Twitter that kind of went back and forth with me.
[00:43:20] And, you know, he said, hey, it does make an impact when you walk away.
[00:43:26] And I agreed with him.
[00:43:27] I said, yes, I know.
[00:43:28] I'm not trying to say it doesn't make an impact when you walk away because it certainly
[00:43:31] does.
[00:43:32] But there's cases where it has more of an impact if you stay and you stay in the game.
[00:43:42] So this is an example right here, a pretty shocking example because we have a guy that's
[00:43:47] 100% on board and is, you know, a street shooting guy that listens to his chain of command.
[00:43:56] Here's what happens.
[00:43:59] Colonel Bob Sink was a magnificent commander.
[00:44:03] But this time he had had a little too much to drink and is ordered to dispatch another
[00:44:08] patrol to capture additional prisoners did not make sense.
[00:44:13] We had already captured sufficient prisoners for interrogation.
[00:44:16] A second patrol would only result in casualties for no apparent reason.
[00:44:23] Either exacerbating the situation was freshly fallen snow along the river that had
[00:44:28] quickly turned to ice during the day.
[00:44:31] If I followed Colonel Sink's order, the enemy would have heard us coming a long way off.
[00:44:38] What to do?
[00:44:41] I responded, yes, sir.
[00:44:45] And then promptly ignored the order.
[00:44:51] So he's doing what I was basically, what I was saying.
[00:44:56] If he just said no sir, we're not going to do that.
[00:44:58] Guess what?
[00:44:59] He's going to get fired and now we're going to get someone else put in charge.
[00:45:03] And even if he doesn't get fired, he's hurting his reputation.
[00:45:06] So it's a bad situation.
[00:45:09] But what he decides to do is go, God, it's sir.
[00:45:11] We'll take care of it.
[00:45:12] And then he promptly ignores the order to now back to the book.
[00:45:16] To give the impression of compliance, however, I assembled the men in a building and told
[00:45:21] them we were not going to send out this patrol because I did not think it was feasible.
[00:45:26] I also informed them that my neck was in a news, if anyone ever said anything about it.
[00:45:32] With that, the men laid down and caught some much needed sleep.
[00:45:35] And I took the radio and adjusted mortar and artillery fire on my supposed objective.
[00:45:42] And here's his thoughts on it.
[00:45:45] On reflection, I did exactly the right thing and I have never had any regrets.
[00:45:51] There was insufficient time for preparation.
[00:45:53] The field to our front was wide open and I would have lost too many men for no purpose.
[00:46:00] I wonder what I would have done had I been a career officer concerned about my own
[00:46:04] future?
[00:46:07] Would I have compromised my beliefs?
[00:46:10] The deliberate disobedience of a lawful order by my commanding officer presented an ethical
[00:46:15] dilemma of the first magnitude.
[00:46:23] But you can see it's a guy who's staying on his principles.
[00:46:27] And his principles were to accomplish the mission, take care of his men and he's weighing
[00:46:31] those things out.
[00:46:32] Those things aren't black and white.
[00:46:35] Those things are not black and white because you look at all the times he did do
[00:46:40] operations and missions and taskings where his guys got wounded and killed.
[00:46:44] But he saw what the purpose was.
[00:46:45] And now he sees something where there's no purpose and he says you know what?
[00:46:48] Not going to do it.
[00:46:49] But he doesn't tell the boss.
[00:46:50] He just does next to you.
[00:46:53] So there's stories of seals and Vietnam doing that.
[00:46:58] And I heard that from the Vietnam seals would tell me, hey, if they got directed to do something
[00:47:04] that they didn't think was a good mission.
[00:47:05] I've talked about this before.
[00:47:07] Oh, we're going to go. You want us to go three kilometers away and set up an ambush
[00:47:11] on this river that's in really tough enemy control areas.
[00:47:13] And we don't know what the intelligence is on who's going to come down that river.
[00:47:16] Okay, cool.
[00:47:18] And they'd patrol 200 meters out the gate.
[00:47:20] Set up a little perimeter, right close to camp where there's no no problems, smoke a couple
[00:47:26] cigarettes.
[00:47:27] It's spent a few hours out there.
[00:47:29] Walk back.
[00:47:30] Yeah, hey, nothing happened.
[00:47:31] No one came down the river.
[00:47:32] I would think you'd have to be pretty responsible though.
[00:47:35] If you're going to kind of exercise that course of action, otherwise you get someone who's
[00:47:40] just like, no, don't feel like it.
[00:47:41] Don't feel like it.
[00:47:42] Yeah, no.
[00:47:43] It's obviously something that a guy like Dick Winner did very rarely.
[00:47:46] And the seals and Vietnam, something they were blown missions off all the time.
[00:47:49] But they, you know, like I said, if something comes up where you completely disagree with
[00:47:56] it, but you don't disagree with it to the point where you want to make a, you want to make
[00:48:02] a stand that's going to make you get fired.
[00:48:04] Now you're not supporting your guys anymore.
[00:48:06] Yeah.
[00:48:07] Yeah.
[00:48:08] You know, okay, you kept them alive that night.
[00:48:09] Well, who's coming in to take your place?
[00:48:12] That's the question.
[00:48:13] Who's coming in to take your place?
[00:48:14] And you don't know who that is.
[00:48:15] And what's their best interest going to be?
[00:48:18] Because whoever comes in to take your place is going to be a company guy that's going to be
[00:48:21] he's going to be a guy that's going to obey every last direct order from the guy.
[00:48:27] And this is, you know, it's strange too.
[00:48:28] I mean, here I am.
[00:48:29] I mean, I was, as, as motivated it to be in the military as I could possibly be.
[00:48:37] You know, so I'm not sitting here calling from you, to from guys.
[00:48:42] But I am telling you to use common sense.
[00:48:44] And you've got to put common sense on top of everything.
[00:48:47] And sometimes common sense outweighs orders.
[00:48:49] That's just the way it is.
[00:48:50] It's rare.
[00:48:51] And I said this last time as well.
[00:48:52] It's rare.
[00:48:53] It's not like you're getting these crazy orders from up the chain of command.
[00:48:56] People aren't people aren't advancing in the military because they're idiots.
[00:49:01] Right.
[00:49:02] Yeah.
[00:49:03] And it's not like they're not on your team.
[00:49:04] And it's not like they want you to get killed.
[00:49:06] And you know, maybe, you know, in this case, he could have given some pushback and said,
[00:49:10] hey, you know what, boss here's what's going on.
[00:49:12] There's fresh snow.
[00:49:13] It's good they're going to hear us coming in a mile away.
[00:49:14] We don't have good cover to the front.
[00:49:16] This is not a good operation.
[00:49:19] But maybe he heard the tone of the Colonel's voice and just said, hey, if I say that, and
[00:49:25] then I don't do it, or if I say that, it's going to make me suspicious.
[00:49:28] So you know what, I got it, sir.
[00:49:30] And then don't do it.
[00:49:32] Just a judge, a judgment of character.
[00:49:36] But that's what you've got writing on you and your in a leadership position.
[00:49:39] You got those guys' lives.
[00:49:41] And that should be more important than anything.
[00:49:44] And it's a strange dichotomy of leadership because on the one hand, you're trained
[00:49:52] your whole military career that you got to take care of your men, take care of your people.
[00:49:59] That's something you get trained on since day one, take care of your team.
[00:50:04] And the dichotomy of that is you're going to do missions where you could very well
[00:50:08] be sending your men to their death.
[00:50:09] So there's a massive dichotomy there.
[00:50:12] And how do you deal with the dichotomy?
[00:50:14] You find the balance.
[00:50:16] And the balance is not a cookie cutter response.
[00:50:21] The balance is different for each scenario that you're in.
[00:50:25] And how well you can weigh those opposing forces is a measure of what kind of leader you
[00:50:33] are.
[00:50:36] That's what makes leadership hard.
[00:50:40] Now we're getting to move through Europe and now we're about to go from war to something
[00:50:57] even more evil, which is the concentration camps, the death camps.
[00:51:04] So back to the book.
[00:51:07] Because they enter, this is back to the book, as they enter the death camps for the first
[00:51:11] time.
[00:51:14] The horror of what we observe remains with each paratrooper to this day.
[00:51:20] You could not explain it.
[00:51:22] You could not describe it.
[00:51:24] And you could not exaggerate it.
[00:51:27] It did not take long to realize that the Nazis were intent on eliminating all the Jews,
[00:51:33] the Nazis, and anyone who disagreed with Hitler's regime.
[00:51:39] The memory of starved, dazed men who dropped their eyes and heads and looked at them through
[00:51:44] the chain-link fence in the same manner that a beaten mystery to dog would cringe.
[00:51:49] Left a mark on all of us forever.
[00:51:54] Nor could you underestimate the barbarity of the Nazi regime, even during the latter stages
[00:52:01] of the war.
[00:52:05] As I went through the war, it was natural to ask myself, why am I here?
[00:52:13] Why am I putting up with a freezing cold, the constant rain, and the loss of so many comrades?
[00:52:19] Does anybody care?
[00:52:22] A soldier faces death on a daily basis, and his life is one of misery and deprivation.
[00:52:30] He is cold, he suffers from hunger frequently bordering on starvation.
[00:52:36] The impact of seeing those people behind that fence left me saying, if only to myself,
[00:52:44] now I know why I am here.
[00:52:47] For the first time, I understand what this war is all about.
[00:52:55] And obviously seeing that evil firsthand.
[00:53:02] That's one of the reasons why I think we explore the darkness and the evil on a fairly regular
[00:53:10] basis here.
[00:53:12] That's why I explore it.
[00:53:14] That's why my mind is drawn to these things because you've got to understand that
[00:53:19] evil is out there, and it's still here today, and somebody has got to take the fight
[00:53:30] to the enemy.
[00:53:37] Now I'm jumping towards the end of the book, and again, it's not really not given anything
[00:53:44] away.
[00:53:45] It's not allowed World War II ended, but this is how winter, or sorry, major winter is
[00:53:54] kind of wraps up their combat back to the book.
[00:54:02] And so many of the co-avadrins returned home, yet all would be forever connected by their
[00:54:09] shared experiences in combat.
[00:54:13] The course of the war, easy company alone, lost 48 men killed, and over 100 wounded,
[00:54:20] incurring 150% casualties.
[00:54:25] This percentage was not uncommon among similar units who had fought in the campaign of Northwest
[00:54:30] Europe.
[00:54:33] At the peak of its effectiveness in Holland in October of 1944, and in the R-Dens in January
[00:54:39] 1945, it was as good a rifle company as there was in the world, according to Arthur Steven
[00:54:47] E. Ambrose.
[00:54:49] How so many men survived the campaigns in Normandy, Holland, Bastone, and Germany was a true
[00:54:56] testament to their courage, their training, and their discipline under fire.
[00:55:05] And now I want to fast forward a little bit more to...
[00:55:12] He's done.
[00:55:14] He's now out of the military, and I know we got a lot of people that listened to the
[00:55:18] show, because a lot of you guys reached out to me, and talk about that transition, a lot
[00:55:23] of people asked me about that transition, and here's Dick Winter's transition.
[00:55:32] While I was extremely happy to put the army behind me, I realized that I was a different
[00:55:38] man than I was when I joined the army over four years earlier.
[00:55:44] The war had changed me in many ways, as it does all who experience combat.
[00:55:51] Having witnessed so much mass suffering, and the unparalleled barbarism that mankind is
[00:55:57] capable of inflicting upon itself.
[00:56:01] I don't see how any survivor can be ever be cruel to anything again.
[00:56:09] In addition, I was a far better judge of character than I had been in 1941.
[00:56:16] That feeling remains with me today a full 60 years after the war.
[00:56:21] When I meet people for the first time and get to know them, I can't help but judge them
[00:56:25] and size them up.
[00:56:27] Do they have leadership?
[00:56:28] Would they be good in combat?
[00:56:31] Do they pass the test?
[00:56:36] I was also more disciplined than I remembered being before I deployed to Europe.
[00:56:43] This discipline helped me adapt to civilian life once I returned to Pennsylvania.
[00:56:49] Like all veterans, I had to adjust to society, the life that you were going to share
[00:56:54] with others in order to make a living.
[00:56:57] I certainly never confused the challenges in the workplace with what I experienced in combat.
[00:57:03] There would be no life and death struggles in the corporate world.
[00:57:07] Business hardly equates to war.
[00:57:10] Such comparisons demean the word.
[00:57:15] When I read that, I actually had to put myself into check.
[00:57:20] I wanted to make sure that I'm clear about something.
[00:57:24] And obviously we wrote a book that's about comparing business and war.
[00:57:33] But I want to make it clear that what we're comparing and what we say is similar.
[00:57:38] In fact, they're the same is that principles, the principles of leadership are the same.
[00:57:45] The struggles and the challenges and the consequences are not the same.
[00:57:49] They are not.
[00:57:53] So I want to make sure I make that clear.
[00:57:59] Now, what's get to some of his reflections on leadership?
[00:58:10] Back to the book.
[00:58:11] Was I a successful leader?
[00:58:14] They tell me I was and modesty prevents me from disagreeing with them.
[00:58:19] I am not so naive that I don't realize the wide appeal of dick winners today as based
[00:58:24] on leadership in combat.
[00:58:27] I may not have been the best commander, but I always strove to be.
[00:58:33] My men depended on me to carefully analyze every tactical situation to maximize the resources
[00:58:38] that I had at my disposal to think under pressure and delete them by personal example.
[00:58:45] I think it's interesting, even here, you know, he's looking back and he's a humble guy.
[00:58:50] You know, I may have not been the best combat commander, but I always tried to be.
[00:58:56] This is a humble man.
[00:58:58] I am not sure there is such a thing as a natural born leader.
[00:59:03] Some leaders are born with special aptitudes or talents.
[00:59:07] But any success I might have had was the product of good upbringing, intense study and
[00:59:13] preparation and physical conditioning that set me apart from my peers.
[00:59:19] Here's dick winners.
[00:59:20] I mean, one of the best kind of combat leaders at the tactical level in the modern era.
[00:59:27] And he's saying that it was preparation and physical conditioning, setting him apart from
[00:59:32] his peers.
[00:59:33] I was all back the book.
[00:59:35] I was also surrounded by a group of men who were disciplined and highly trained to accomplish
[00:59:39] any mission.
[00:59:41] I'd love to the equation and you can understand that the secret to my success was that
[00:59:45] somehow I always managed to survive another day.
[00:59:50] In recent years, I've been asked to address an increasing number of civic groups, corporate
[00:59:55] seminars, and governmental agencies on the subject of leadership.
[01:00:02] Most are looking for cookie cutter solutions as to what constitutes a successful leader.
[01:00:10] What is the recipe for success?
[01:00:12] And this is classic.
[01:00:14] And actually when the book came out, we did a bunch of interviews that got turned into either
[01:00:25] short articles or video clips.
[01:00:28] And they title these things.
[01:00:30] Like three things every leader must do.
[01:00:32] And that's what they always do.
[01:00:34] Everyone's looking exactly for what he says.
[01:00:36] They start looking for cookie cutter solutions to what constitutes a successful leader.
[01:00:42] What is the recipe for success?
[01:00:45] In truth, there are no simple solutions.
[01:00:49] Just as there is no average day in combat.
[01:00:53] Each situation is different.
[01:00:54] And each requires a leader to be flexible in adapting his or her particular leadership style
[01:01:00] to the specific circumstances required to accomplish any mission.
[01:01:05] It's a matter of adjusting to the individual and you do this every day.
[01:01:10] You don't have just one way of treating people.
[01:01:13] You adjust yourself to whom you are talking.
[01:01:20] If I would give advice to a young leader going to war based on my observation of what
[01:01:25] I had constituted the success of the outstanding leaders who comprised the American parachute
[01:01:30] infantry regiment of World War II, I would offer a series of principles that I am
[01:01:35] certain would result in great success regardless of the field endeavor, field of endeavor
[01:01:40] in which the individual was participating.
[01:01:42] So here he's saying the same thing that I said, which is leadership is the same, whether
[01:01:46] it's in the battlefield or whatever endeavor you're going into, leadership principles
[01:01:50] stay the same.
[01:01:53] First and foremost, a leader should strive to be an individual of flawless character,
[01:02:00] physical competence and moral courage.
[01:02:05] If you have character, that means you are the guy, that means the guy you are dealing
[01:02:09] with can trust you.
[01:02:13] The men trust you have faith in you and they obey you no questions asked.
[01:02:19] That's character in a nutshell.
[01:02:22] Character also allows you to make decisions quickly and correctly.
[01:02:26] One may question my decision to disobey a direct order from my commanding officer.
[01:02:31] This is the story we already talked about.
[01:02:34] And to fake another patrol as a violation of that very principle I'm advocating.
[01:02:41] In my heart, however, I could not send my men to risk their lives for no apparent reason
[01:02:46] when clearly nothing would have been gained that we had not already achieved.
[01:02:51] Such a course takes a degree of moral courage, which I have found is far rather than physical
[01:02:57] courage.
[01:02:58] Was I correct?
[01:03:00] In my estimation, I fought so and I have never regretted my decision.
[01:03:06] The same holds true for developing leaders of competency.
[01:03:10] Those entrusted to lead must study their profession to become totally proficient in tactics
[01:03:15] and technology.
[01:03:17] Prior to the invasion, I read every tactical manual I could lay my hands on to improve
[01:03:22] my tactical knowledge and professional competence while other soldiers were out curousing
[01:03:27] in the pubs.
[01:03:29] While they were enjoying the social life of the neighboring towns, I was reading and educating
[01:03:33] myself, getting ready to lead men into combat.
[01:03:41] Getting smarter.
[01:03:43] Open it up the books.
[01:03:44] That's what he was doing.
[01:03:46] And that's part of leadership.
[01:03:47] That's part of his characteristics of leadership is to become knowledgeable to read and
[01:03:55] study.
[01:03:59] He goes on.
[01:04:00] Don't waste time attempting to define leadership.
[01:04:03] No need to go to a dictionary.
[01:04:06] The infantry school at Fort Benning, Georgia has defined leadership in just two words via
[01:04:11] its motto, follow me.
[01:04:19] And he's going to do it again right here.
[01:04:24] Physical fitness is another prerequisite for success.
[01:04:28] I freely admit that I was blessed with a sound physical constitution but whenever possible
[01:04:32] I took the opportunity to improve my physical stamina.
[01:04:37] As I was in such good physical shape, I easily survived to coa.
[01:04:41] That's their initial training that they went through for airborne.
[01:04:44] While men washed out on a daily basis, the contingent from easy company that completed
[01:04:49] the training and earned their wings at Fort Benning were tough as nails.
[01:04:54] Because I was in such good shape, my fatigue level never reached the point of physical
[01:04:59] exhaustion that contributes to mental exhaustion and ultimately to combat fatigue.
[01:05:04] We all experience sleep deprivation at times.
[01:05:08] That is the nature of stress.
[01:05:10] But a physically exhausted leader routinely makes poor decisions in times of crisis.
[01:05:20] And here he talks about another piece.
[01:05:26] I have always felt that my principal contribution to the success of both easy company and
[01:05:31] second battalion was based on my knowledge of what to expect from each man.
[01:05:39] Know your people.
[01:05:43] Having selected the right men for the right job, I then delegated the authority to my
[01:05:48] subordinates and allowed them to use their initiative to execute the mission.
[01:05:55] Decentralized command.
[01:05:57] There is no need to tell someone how to do his job if you have properly trained your
[01:06:03] team.
[01:06:09] Good preparation is always vital to the success of any operation.
[01:06:13] But leaders must remain flexible once the action commences.
[01:06:19] Steve Ambrose likes to quote general Eisenhower who claimed before the battle is joined,
[01:06:24] plans or everything.
[01:06:26] Once the battle is joined, however plans go out the window.
[01:06:36] Next I would encourage leaders to take a moment of self reflection before rushing into
[01:06:41] important decisions.
[01:06:44] This is a little bit of detachment.
[01:06:47] Many leaders don't take the time to consider carefully their decisions or the implications
[01:06:51] of their actions.
[01:06:54] In battle, I periodically detached myself mentally from the noises and the chaos of battle.
[01:07:02] I found it useful to separate myself momentarily and to carefully think through what actions
[01:07:08] I needed to take to accomplish the mission.
[01:07:11] Again, I read this book for the first time last week.
[01:07:16] He's saying detachment straight up.
[01:07:18] He's saying the exact same in battle, I periodically detached myself mentally from the noises
[01:07:23] and chaos of battle.
[01:07:27] Hang tough.
[01:07:29] Never, ever give up regardless of the adversity.
[01:07:34] If you are a leader, a fellow who other fellows look to, you have got to keep going.
[01:07:42] I would also urge leaders to remain humble.
[01:07:49] If you don't worry about who gets the credit, you get a lot more done.
[01:07:55] Again, this is when people ask me what's the most important quality of a leader.
[01:07:58] I tell them that humility.
[01:08:01] Leaders should assume the blame when the operation fails.
[01:08:08] When it succeeds, credit the men and women in your team.
[01:08:12] They do the lion's share of the work.
[01:08:16] And now he's going to talk about humility a little bit more.
[01:08:19] Since the release of the HBO miniseries, many of us have been flooded with hundreds, sometimes
[01:08:25] thousands of letters from adoring fans across the nation.
[01:08:31] The attention is certainly flattering and greatly appreciated.
[01:08:37] But it remains better to remember Eisenhower's address at Guild Hall Hall on June 12,
[01:08:44] 1945, to an ecstatic British public, which showered the Supreme Commander with a tumultuous
[01:08:53] parade through the streets of London.
[01:08:56] I commanded them.
[01:09:01] Humility must always be the portion of any man who receives a claim earned in the blood of
[01:09:09] his followers and the sacrifices of his friends.
[01:09:17] I think anybody that's ever been in a leadership position and has been called some kind
[01:09:25] of hero will think back to that statement.
[01:09:29] Humility must always be the portion of any man who receives a claim earned in the blood
[01:09:35] of his followers and the sacrifices of his friends.
[01:09:44] And I think when you use that word hero, it's something that obviously gets thrown
[01:09:53] around a lot.
[01:09:59] And here's what Major Winners had to say about that, perhaps the best characterization
[01:10:07] of what a true hero consists is found in a letter, Sergeant Mike Rainy sent me in January
[01:10:16] 1982, surely before he went back to the hospital for a series of tests.
[01:10:22] Historians Stephen Ambrose used the passage to conclude band of brothers because Rainy
[01:10:26] encapsulated the cohesion that became the hallmark of easy company.
[01:10:33] In thinking back on the days of easy company, I'm treasuring my remark to a grandson who
[01:10:40] asked grandpa, were you a hero in the war?
[01:10:47] No, I answered, but I served in a company of heroes.
[01:10:54] And I can tell you that I also served with many, many heroes, the guys in tasking to bruiser
[01:11:02] the guys from 2 to 8 infantry, the guys from 1-1-AD and the ready first, the soldiers and
[01:11:07] the Marines, all those brave men.
[01:11:19] And some brave women as well.
[01:11:26] And to those men and women, those soldiers and Marines that I was lucky enough to serve
[01:11:32] with, I think that this statement right here from Dick Winners is something that I think
[01:11:42] is very fitting.
[01:11:46] As I look back on the men of easy company and the closeness we have enjoyed over the years,
[01:11:52] I reminded of the dialogue attributed to a senior German officer bidding farewell to his men
[01:11:58] in the HBO miniseries.
[01:12:02] Paraphrasing his words, I would say to easy company and the officers in men of the 506
[01:12:09] parachute infantry regiment.
[01:12:12] It has been a long war.
[01:12:16] It's been a hard war.
[01:12:21] You have fought bravely, proudly for your country.
[01:12:26] You are a special group of men connected by a bond that only exists in combat.
[01:12:33] You've shared the in-communicable experience of war and have been tested under extreme
[01:12:39] adversity.
[01:12:41] You've shared foxholes and have held each other in dire moments.
[01:12:47] You've seen death and have suffered together.
[01:12:51] You've lived in an environment totally incomprehensible to those who do not know war.
[01:13:00] I am proud and deeply honored to have served with every one of you.
[01:13:06] You all deserve long and happy lives in peace.
[01:13:12] I bid each of you God's speed and ask the Almighty to shower his blessings on you and your
[01:13:18] families now and for generations to come.
[01:13:24] And that wraps the book and, you know, I was thinking after the last podcast that this
[01:13:34] was going to be a lighter one.
[01:13:39] And I picked this book specifically because I see major dick winners as an incredible person,
[01:13:47] incredible leader, a role model for everyone.
[01:13:53] But because we are talking about war, there is still tragedy and loss and darkness there.
[01:14:04] And that's okay.
[01:14:12] And do you vet out there like the anonymous Marine that wrote that tribute to his brothers
[01:14:22] from April 2nd?
[01:14:26] And we know there's hundreds of thousands of veterans that are feeling that every day.
[01:14:31] If you're having one of those dark days, it's okay.
[01:14:42] It's okay.
[01:14:49] It's okay to feel that darkness.
[01:14:56] It's okay to remember it and miss it and hate it and love it.
[01:15:04] And it's okay to wish it never happened.
[01:15:08] And at the same time, to wish it never stopped.
[01:15:15] And it's okay to want to take it all back.
[01:15:21] And at the same time, to want to do it all again.
[01:15:31] And if you've got in your mind that you think that people don't understand, that's okay.
[01:15:43] They don't.
[01:15:46] But you do.
[01:15:50] You know darkness, you know evil.
[01:15:57] But more important than that.
[01:16:01] You know good.
[01:16:06] You know light.
[01:16:10] You know laughter and love better than anyone.
[01:16:20] So embrace.
[01:16:29] Embrace that darkness.
[01:16:31] Own it.
[01:16:32] Don't look away from it.
[01:16:34] Don't bury it in booze or in pills.
[01:16:39] Listen.
[01:16:42] Listen to what corporal Scott Procopio would have been saying to you, live your life.
[01:16:49] Embrace your life with physical activity and with nature and with you jutsu and with
[01:16:59] son and with laughter and guitar and good memories and creativity and discipline.
[01:17:10] Discipline yourself.
[01:17:15] So you can free yourself and move forward into the future.
[01:17:29] Whether there's no more darkness and no more war.
[01:17:34] But peace.
[01:17:40] Good evening, Echo.
[01:17:42] Good evening.
[01:17:47] Little message to the vets out there.
[01:17:49] I hear from a lot of veterans and I just want to let those guys know, you know, kind of
[01:17:56] where I'm coming from, get a lot of real positive stuff from guys and let some guys go
[01:18:03] with you hard times and I know it and you know, I'm hoping to be able to kind of spread
[01:18:13] my thoughts where I'm at and how what I think of these things.
[01:18:23] Because you know, if you get guys like major winners that you know did everything that
[01:18:32] he did in war, he came back and you know, he was able to figure it out and a lot of
[01:18:38] those veterans were and they, you know, he said, wasn't an easy adaptation that they
[01:18:42] made but they made it.
[01:18:46] They made it.
[01:18:49] So I think you got to embrace those things and be stronger than them.
[01:19:00] And I know and I said all the time, you got to know that darkness and you really want
[01:19:03] to appreciate the light and I think that guys that have been to war, they can do that
[01:19:11] and life can seem so much better.
[01:19:17] You know how bad it can be.
[01:19:23] So speaking of feedback from people, rough transition right now, but that's what we do here.
[01:19:38] What rough transition?
[01:19:41] Rough transitions.
[01:19:42] And you know what?
[01:19:43] You know what's interesting about the rough transitions?
[01:19:44] And any movement that's out there that's listening to me right now or anybody that's not
[01:19:47] a vet that anyone that's been through hard times and loss, it's a big rough transition
[01:19:53] and you go in and out emotionally.
[01:19:56] And you know, you'll be feeling like crap one minute and then the next minute you'll feel
[01:20:00] okay and you'll be laughing and that's, that's like I said, that's okay.
[01:20:04] I think a lot of people are scared that they might be acting the wrong way.
[01:20:12] But it's all right.
[01:20:15] It's okay.
[01:20:16] Yeah, and just like how you're saying where it may seem like people don't understand
[01:20:20] and that's okay because they don't, that's so true because in this way, I think of it
[01:20:26] because my best friends are actually they're still in, maybe seals.
[01:20:32] So these are guys that you grow up with.
[01:20:34] Grow up with and spend your best friends there in my wedding.
[01:20:39] So a lot of them do you don't want to talk to them and stuff?
[01:20:42] I just in my own head I kind of imagine what it's like coming back.
[01:20:47] So if you kind of consider it kind of in a nutshell where you consider, hey, what's your
[01:20:51] biggest problems when you're overseas, when you're in the war?
[01:20:54] What are these big problems you gotta worry about?
[01:20:56] Okay, and then let's factor that in okay, then we come home and then look okay, let's
[01:21:02] say in the where your biggest problem is getting shot and die.
[01:21:05] Are you getting both your legs blown off or whatever?
[01:21:12] Whatever your biggest problem is as far as worrying about.
[01:21:16] Okay, then you come home and on and on your girlfriend or your wife is like, hey, I thought
[01:21:20] I told you to do those dishes and she's flipping out on you.
[01:21:24] So in the back of your mind, you're kind of like okay, wait, the comparison, it was two days
[01:21:29] ago.
[01:21:30] I was in the desert worried about my legs being blown off.
[01:21:32] And now I'm here, we're apparently the biggest problem according to my girlfriend's
[01:21:37] life.
[01:21:38] The biggest problem on earth.
[01:21:39] Apparently because she's the only one she's really met, she's met.
[01:21:42] She won't really talk to me or the dishes, yeah.
[01:21:45] And it's just not computing, you know?
[01:21:47] And then you go next door and their biggest problem is kind on the same level.
[01:21:51] So yeah, they don't understand.
[01:21:53] And you in a way you're living in this crazy world where I can see how that could kind
[01:21:59] of get to you and be like, man, am I wrong?
[01:22:02] Yeah, so one of the things that I and you hear me talk about this before is perspective.
[01:22:07] And wanting to see, I always talk about it from a leadership perspective like I want to
[01:22:10] think about what my superior is thinking.
[01:22:13] Why is he telling me to do this?
[01:22:14] Let me get his perspective.
[01:22:16] And then what are my, what are my subordinates thinking?
[01:22:19] What is their perspective?
[01:22:21] And it's a very useful tool to use and what you're talking about right now.
[01:22:25] And I remember I had a situation like that where I would be like, I'm not going to
[01:22:29] always at work.
[01:22:30] And I forget what was going on, but something was going on.
[01:22:33] Like I think we were preparing to deploy guys earlier.
[01:22:36] There's something major was going on.
[01:22:38] There was major issues.
[01:22:40] I think it was Afghanistan.
[01:22:42] And we were getting ready to deploy guys early.
[01:22:44] It was a real big spin up and all this stuff.
[01:22:46] And literally I come home and I mean, I'm at work and we're trying to figure out I
[01:22:53] were put this plan together and guys are going to play and it's horrible and you know,
[01:22:58] whatever.
[01:22:59] I'm just stressed.
[01:23:00] I come home and I, hey, babe, you know how you doing?
[01:23:03] I said in my wife and she's sitting there and all of a sudden she like picks up the
[01:23:07] phone and someone calls her or she, someone calls her, she picks up the phone and she
[01:23:11] hangs up.
[01:23:12] She's like, I can't believe this.
[01:23:13] Yeah, and I'm like, I thought something, you know, I thought someone died or
[01:23:17] whatever.
[01:23:18] And I said, I said, oh, what's wrong?
[01:23:20] What's wrong?
[01:23:21] And she said, um, there was something along like the wiggles is the same night as
[01:23:26] Barney and I booked both tickets.
[01:23:28] So with some things she was taking the kids to that like the literally did not matter
[01:23:33] in any way shape or formed a me at all.
[01:23:35] But it's her, you know, she had spent $22 on these tickets for three kids at the time.
[01:23:40] At $66 and now she had booked double booked the children for multiple shows.
[01:23:46] It was harsh.
[01:23:47] But what I had to do is well, you know, I had to go in perspective in a whole and
[01:23:52] world.
[01:23:53] Man, that was $66, right?
[01:23:56] And it was the kids and it was, they both wanted to see all the shows or whatever the
[01:23:59] thing was.
[01:24:00] So in her perspective, in her part of the world, that's a really big deal.
[01:24:04] And so that's, I think something you're going to do as a, as a, as a, as a human, always
[01:24:09] look at one of the people's perspectives are.
[01:24:11] And you know what, if people are pissed off, if your wife's freaking out because you didn't
[01:24:14] do the dishes, I got some really easy solution to that.
[01:24:18] Do the dishes.
[01:24:20] Just do the dishes.
[01:24:21] Yeah.
[01:24:22] You were put on some music and scrub some pots and pans.
[01:24:26] Let's do this.
[01:24:27] You know what, I'll scrub some pots and pans.
[01:24:29] Be happy to.
[01:24:30] Let's do this happen.
[01:24:31] Yeah.
[01:24:32] That's good, man.
[01:24:33] And then, you know, that if you have the ability and kind of the wherewithal to do that, to, to,
[01:24:38] really it's detaching, you detaching and looking at their situation, not looking at it from
[01:24:42] your own personal situation.
[01:24:46] If you can manage to do that, and I think it helps when someone reminds you, like, just
[01:24:50] like, you say, right now.
[01:24:51] And maybe someone will be like, hey, you know what, let me, let me go ahead and remember
[01:24:54] that next time.
[01:24:55] You know, all this stuff.
[01:24:56] And I say this to leaders all the time when I go out and work with companies.
[01:25:00] It's so much of it is just about awareness.
[01:25:02] Yes.
[01:25:03] When you become aware of the problem, you become aware of the mistake or you become aware
[01:25:06] of the solution.
[01:25:07] And it's there in front of you.
[01:25:08] Then it becomes very easy.
[01:25:09] The problem is, you people aren't aware of how easy it can be to solve some of these things.
[01:25:14] If you just make this small adjustment to your mentality.
[01:25:17] Yeah.
[01:25:18] The way of is the fact that you're freaking steaming red lining for the fifth time, your
[01:25:24] wife told you to do something when like I said, you're worrying about your guys getting
[01:25:29] killed yesterday.
[01:25:30] Yes, today is a go.
[01:25:32] Yeah.
[01:25:33] As one of my buddies, you used to say, when we are coming home from our first deployment,
[01:25:37] he says, can you believe this tomorrow?
[01:25:41] We're going to get on an aluminum tube and we're going to wake up back in Sydney.
[01:25:45] I was like, okay, man, take it easy.
[01:25:49] I'll stay.
[01:25:50] You need to be broke.
[01:25:52] All right.

[01:28:32] Now on jaccopodcast.com on the top.
[01:28:33] I added it on the menu where it says books.

[01:28:47] Yeah.
[01:28:48] Easy.
[01:28:49] All right.
[01:28:50] Let's get some questions.
[01:28:51] Okay.
[01:28:52] Question number one.
[01:28:56] Is taking extreme ownership the same as apologizing for failures or apologizing for
[01:29:01] others mistakes?
[01:29:02] I'm having difficulty separating these two concepts when I try to take ownership over
[01:29:07] failures.
[01:29:08] Does taking ownership of failure generally include in I'm sorry, X occurred?
[01:29:13] It's such or it's such.
[01:29:15] Well, it isn't just apologizing, right?
[01:29:20] It isn't just saying, oh, I apologize this happened.
[01:29:23] It's part of it.
[01:29:24] Part of ownership is apologizing.
[01:29:25] If you make a mistake, you've got to own it and generally you've got to say, hey, look,
[01:29:28] I'm sorry this happened.
[01:29:30] You've got to own that there's been a problem or a mistake or an issue.
[01:29:34] And that does include other people's mistakes, but you have to literally take ownership
[01:29:40] of them.
[01:29:43] You can't say, hey, I'm sorry these other people made mistakes.
[01:29:47] That's not what I'm talking about.
[01:29:49] And it's look, the mistakes that were made were actually my fault.
[01:29:54] And another important thing here is you can't just say, hey, guys, it's all my fault.
[01:30:01] You actually need to believe it yourself.
[01:30:05] You need to believe that you failed in the situation to do the right thing or make something
[01:30:11] happen or make the right decision or make the right call and do the right preparation
[01:30:14] or whatever it is that you're supposed to do, you need to do that.
[01:30:18] You need to believe that.
[01:30:20] You can't just say it.
[01:30:21] And you say these mistakes were my fault.
[01:30:25] Here's why it was my fault.
[01:30:27] And yeah, I'm sorry that these things happen.
[01:30:29] I apologize with this happening.
[01:30:31] And some people see sorry as a sign of weakness.
[01:30:37] And honestly, there's some legal situations you might be in or some negotiations that you
[01:30:42] might be in where that might be true.
[01:30:45] But most of the time, I was just going to work in environment, inside of a team.
[01:30:52] Sorry is okay.
[01:30:53] And in fact, an apology is often the first step in moving forward.
[01:30:59] And it's generally going to be a little bit of a blow to your ego.
[01:31:06] Now, and that's especially true because your mystery and ownership now or Mrs. extreme
[01:31:12] ownership.
[01:31:13] Guess what?
[01:31:14] That doesn't mean everyone else is not yet.
[01:31:15] They'll get there.
[01:31:16] But they're not there yet.
[01:31:18] So you apologize to someone.
[01:31:20] It's going to be a big blow to your ego, especially when someone says, you're damn right
[01:31:24] that was your fault.
[01:31:27] That's going to hurt your ego.
[01:31:28] I don't want to lash back out, but you can't.
[01:31:30] You've got to put your ego in check.
[01:31:33] And you got to go, hey, I understand.
[01:31:35] That is my fault.
[01:31:36] Why I'm saying it's my fault?
[01:31:37] Because I truly believe it was my fault.
[01:31:38] Because it is.
[01:31:40] Because it is your fault.
[01:31:42] So you have to be careful when someone glows don't let that get your head.
[01:31:46] That's what you have to do.
[01:31:48] And it's not just for you that you're doing this.
[01:31:51] It's because the team has to figure out what the problem is.
[01:31:55] Someone's going to take ownership of the problem, that's you.
[01:31:58] And then I'll tell you you get the problem solved.
[01:32:00] And I'll tell you something else.
[01:32:03] And you might have predicted this.
[01:32:05] But my sorry and my apology comes with something else.
[01:32:12] 99% of the time.
[01:32:14] And that's a good.
[01:32:19] So look, hey, I'm sorry that this happened.
[01:32:22] This is my fault.
[01:32:23] But I'm glad it happened now.
[01:32:24] Oh, yeah.
[01:32:25] Hey, you know what?
[01:32:27] I'm glad we made this mistake.
[01:32:29] We made this mistake right now.
[01:32:30] It's going to set us back a little bit good because when we're not going to make it with
[01:32:33] a client.
[01:32:35] Oh, this happened.
[01:32:39] This part of the project fell apart.
[01:32:40] Good.
[01:32:41] Now we can fix it.
[01:32:42] We know about it.
[01:32:43] Oh, this went sideways.
[01:32:45] I missed it.
[01:32:46] Good.
[01:32:47] I won't let it happen again.
[01:32:49] So throw yourself a little good on the end of your sorry.
[01:32:54] Yeah.
[01:32:55] All right.
[01:32:56] Yeah, a lot of times those problems or mistakes or whatever they add to that experience,
[01:33:01] like the experience of being there.
[01:33:04] You know, where let's say you go through a path and you make a wrong turn.
[01:33:08] Now you have that experience that that's a wrong turn.
[01:33:10] That's what that looks like.
[01:33:11] That's what that feels like.
[01:33:12] And guess what?
[01:33:14] We're going to avoid that in the future.
[01:33:15] Rather than a bunch of situations where we're, for example, one in the future where it's
[01:33:19] more detrimental.
[01:33:20] Now you don't run into that.
[01:33:23] Yeah.
[01:33:24] You learned.
[01:33:25] You learned.
[01:33:26] I probably think of it.
[01:33:27] So a video that said that.
[01:33:28] Be good.
[01:33:29] You learned.
[01:33:30] All right.
[01:33:32] Next question.
[01:33:35] Is there a way to be a straight shooter?
[01:33:37] Oh, sorry.
[01:33:38] Is there a way to be straight shooter jocco and not be a jerk or piss people off?
[01:33:47] You know, this is a touch you.
[01:33:52] Is everybody has so much respect for the straight shooter, right?
[01:33:58] Hey, that guy's a straight shooter and you want to be a straight shooter.
[01:34:01] You don't want to be someone that you don't want to be the opposite.
[01:34:04] What's the opposite of a straight shooter?
[01:34:05] That's like a liar.
[01:34:06] Right.
[01:34:07] The seever.
[01:34:08] A deceiver, right?
[01:34:09] So of course, we want to be the straight shooter.
[01:34:11] Let me tell you, it is very difficult to be a straight shooter with everybody.
[01:34:15] Even when you have a tremendous relationship with somebody, a tremendous relationship with
[01:34:21] somebody.
[01:34:22] Can you really be a straight shooter with them?
[01:34:25] A true straight shooter.
[01:34:27] I've been a true straight shooter with probably three or four people in my life.
[01:34:37] In my life, I've been a straight shooter with maybe three or four people.
[01:34:41] That's off the top of my head.
[01:34:43] But I'm just saying it's not a big number.
[01:34:46] It's got to be something that you are so in sync with.
[01:34:52] I'm thinking about that.
[01:34:53] I don't think that's impossible for me in my situation.
[01:34:58] It's hard to be a straight shooter.
[01:34:59] How can you reconcile being a straight shooter now?
[01:35:02] Consider what that means.
[01:35:03] But to be a straight shooter with somebody at all times.
[01:35:07] Can't really do that.
[01:35:09] What do we do instead?
[01:35:10] You've got to use the indirect approach, the indirect approach.
[01:35:14] I'm talking about this all the time.
[01:35:15] This is a nuance that people come out on podcasts 12.
[01:35:20] They say, hey, I heard you say this.
[01:35:22] I'm going to go, remember that question we got to ask, do you ever get told you're
[01:35:27] to direct to intense?
[01:35:28] It's like no, I don't get told that.
[01:35:31] Because I don't believe in being trying to be a straight shooter with everybody.
[01:35:33] What I believe in is trying to get my message across to people so that it gets absorbed
[01:35:37] by them.
[01:35:39] The minute you straight shoot somebody, their defenses go up and it becomes problematic.
[01:35:43] There's some indirect approaches when you have these discussions with people when you
[01:35:49] use conversation to get your point across.
[01:35:51] Hey, I was looking at this and I was wondering what I could do better.
[01:35:55] Can you help me?
[01:35:57] Or what can we do better?
[01:35:59] You throwing the Wii on it.
[01:36:02] Or you don't want to say something like that.
[01:36:03] You got so much going on right now.
[01:36:06] Do you want me to take anything off you?
[01:36:07] You want me to take that thing off you're played that's kind of like a small little
[01:36:10] detail.
[01:36:11] Do you want me to handle that?
[01:36:13] Or you know, hey, it seems like you're having a micromanage this guy over here.
[01:36:17] You want me to go straight in that out and run that?
[01:36:21] Or it seems like this guy is taking up too much of your time.
[01:36:24] You want me to take that over or take that person over or you know it's a good one.
[01:36:30] Is hey, can you help me with my team members?
[01:36:35] I just want to sit down with you and just like have you talked to me about what you
[01:36:40] see in my team members.
[01:36:42] And then when you're you're discussing your team members and other people even your peers
[01:36:49] and what they do good in that.
[01:36:50] But what you're really doing is you're just tossing some things their way, some little
[01:36:55] things their way so that they understand and they it and it's kind of like teaching
[01:37:00] to get to right when you teach when you teach a move or teaching anything when you teach
[01:37:03] a move you learn it better right?
[01:37:06] If you make somebody teach a move they're going to learn it better.
[01:37:10] So when you make someone sit down with you and go through the issues that people are having
[01:37:16] it actually makes them self-reflect but they don't know it.
[01:37:21] But they reap the results of it.
[01:37:23] So that's a that's a crafty one that I've used a bunch.
[01:37:28] Let's see here's a good one.
[01:37:30] I think I'm letting you down.
[01:37:32] I don't think I'm doing a good enough job.
[01:37:33] You know it's like I think I'm just be careful with that one.
[01:37:37] It seems like if you if you hit the wrong tone, you're going to be careful with all these.
[01:37:41] You gotta be careful with all these.
[01:37:42] You gotta be tactful.
[01:37:44] You can ask some more direct questions but when you ask the more direct questions you
[01:37:49] gotta be sort of you gotta be true you gotta be you gotta come across as being very truthful
[01:37:56] in your in your inquisition.
[01:37:58] So for instance hey what was the strategy that you were thinking about over here?
[01:38:01] Like before this old thing of fellow part you know what to have but you know what you think
[01:38:05] or or hey what was what were you thinking about when you put this together because I
[01:38:09] I don't quite I don't quite get it.
[01:38:12] You gotta be careful that's another one.
[01:38:13] Yeah.
[01:38:14] You gotta be careful.
[01:38:15] You gotta be careful.
[01:38:16] That's okay.
[01:38:17] What were you thinking right?
[01:38:19] Right.
[01:38:20] Right.
[01:38:21] You gotta be soft with you.
[01:38:22] So it's much better to be indirect and most of these cases.
[01:38:28] And hopefully you can build relationships with people where you can be more direct or you
[01:38:31] can get that conversation to be where it needs to be to where you can get the key
[01:38:35] critical information across but it's very very challenging.
[01:38:38] Yeah.
[01:38:39] And again, it ain't it's not that challenging it's not impossible I did it with everybody
[01:38:42] all the time.
[01:38:43] I always had got my point across to people.
[01:38:47] Always you know and I'll tell you this is something when I would straight shoot somebody
[01:38:54] I would and this is if I really needed to straight shoot somebody I would write them
[01:39:01] a very lengthy email to say hey here's what's going on here's what I'm saying and I would
[01:39:11] really craft it with a lot of patience and and then I would either do once I wrote the
[01:39:17] email I would either use that and wouldn't send it but I'd use it as a guide to myself
[01:39:22] like okay this is the conversation I'm gonna have or I'd send it to them for real.
[01:39:26] Like a deal.
[01:39:27] Yeah like a deal note you know I actually read one of those.
[01:39:30] I read one of those on on on on on on on or two or five I think it was number five that
[01:39:36] is one of those things that I did I said okay you know what I got to help this guy out
[01:39:39] got to be direct with them he's making some mistakes I want him do better here's a
[01:39:43] little deal note for you get you square away the thing is these this is definitely hard
[01:39:50] but it's not impossible you got to just have the open mind you got to use your
[01:39:55] attack you got to use your judgment and you got to build relationships and have conversations with people
[01:40:00] and and know what your intention is in the conversation and just keep slowly moving in that
[01:40:06] direction.
[01:40:07] You know what I a tip and I'm gonna say this tip because I like when people do it to me
[01:40:13] when they're like correcting me or whatever is sprinkling little comments about the stuff
[01:40:20] that that they did right.
[01:40:22] Yeah that's a common practice.
[01:40:24] Yeah but when you do that though you add in this you add in and that's what I like about
[01:40:29] you you do this you know so it's you know so if you add in that's what I like about you
[01:40:33] it kind of individualizes that person like I'm the guy who does that you know that good
[01:40:38] part so it gives them that confidence so it's kind of like yeah tell me more kind of
[01:40:41] attitude and then at the end doing like something along the lines of like yeah good
[01:40:47] thanks you know thanks for the time or whatever and then be like I got your back yeah kind
[01:40:50] of lead.
[01:40:51] Well I mean we could go over techniques all night long those are both good ones you know
[01:40:56] another one is like hey listen I think you can be a top performer here I think you're
[01:41:01] gonna this is if you're talking to someone that's you know like a subordinate I think
[01:41:04] you can be a top performer here there's here's what you're kicking ass out yes this
[01:41:08] this and this here's this these two things right here if we can get these fixed you're
[01:41:13] going platinum when we get these things when we get you know you're gonna pause it look
[01:41:18] you I'm I'm imagining in the sense of you telling me this and like you get
[01:41:22] to yourself you know yeah so like they just say like when I'd be like hey and I'd
[01:41:28] ask him to say I'm in this position and he'd be like like yeah then later on you
[01:41:32] know I text him what are the hey thanks for going over this with me just like
[01:41:36] Cabrol you don't keep it up and you can be like a world champion you just say that
[01:41:39] and I don't know who else he says that to everybody I don't know he's never said
[01:41:42] that to me that's because we hate each other but for that moment I'm like
[01:41:48] hell yeah you know like I hope he corrects me more I hope he tells me how to do
[01:41:53] this because he obviously just like I was saying you know you could be a top
[01:41:56] performer here yeah tell me what else what can I do what can I do and actually the
[01:42:00] point that you're making is very good point which is you know picture going to
[01:42:07] perspective of the other person and what is it gonna sound like to them and that's
[01:42:10] a smart thing to do so you're you're hearing what you would hear if you were
[01:42:15] them yeah yeah indirect people be indirect it's harder it's challenging it takes
[01:42:24] more time it takes more patience and it is way more effective in fact
[01:42:30] and we talked about how before like some people they'll be like hey I'm just
[01:42:34] I'm just I tell it how it is you know I tell how it is and if you don't like
[01:42:38] you kind of think and all right go ahead and do that but see how that works out for
[01:42:42] you know see how many people follow you see many people want to listen to you
[01:42:45] many people want to be around you even you know I like the indirect approach to
[01:42:50] next question joko what is the number one philosophical lesson that you've
[01:42:56] learned from jiu jitsu yeah so jiu jitsu emphasizes so much of what I believe
[01:43:10] that it's tough to narrow down but I will but I will throw some things out
[01:43:18] there that kind of our part of jiu jitsu and our part of what I believe
[01:43:23] first of all we just talked about being indirect an indirect attacks flanking
[01:43:30] that's what you have to do in jiu jitsu you have to set things up you have to
[01:43:34] detach you have to detach from the chaos and from the emotional you cannot get
[01:43:38] emotional on the mat attack the flanks you gotta hit people where they're
[01:43:42] expecting it you gotta have a plan but you gotta be ready to adapt you gotta
[01:43:47] constantly improve your position you gotta have fun while you're doing it you
[01:43:53] gotta practice being in bad situations you gotta make your training is
[01:43:57] realistic as possible right these are all things I talk about these in all
[01:44:01] aspects of combat and in business and in life you gotta be physically fit
[01:44:08] to your mind stay sharp that's true true in jiu jitsu it's true in combat it's
[01:44:14] true in life you gotta know when to tap right you gotta know when to tap you
[01:44:20] gotta know when to give up on a single battle so that you don't lose the whole
[01:44:24] war gotta train for worst case scenarios you gotta start with that person on
[01:44:30] your back gotta start with the person with you in an arm lock and training for
[01:44:38] combat you gotta train for those worst case scenarios where you're outnumbered
[01:44:41] you got a bunker position and there's shooting paintball at you and you got
[01:44:43] down men that's what you gotta do you gotta train for the worst case scenarios
[01:44:47] and same thing with business I work with like sales group sometimes and they'll
[01:44:52] do role play and I'll say you know be the worst customer you can possibly be
[01:44:58] exactly when this person meets a normal human they they know how to knock it out
[01:45:03] of the park here's another one from jiu jitsu basically don't judge a book by
[01:45:09] it's cover right because you don't know if the person that you're about the
[01:45:13] slap is Jeff Glover or his Dean Lister or Jill Tudor or Joel Tudor you don't
[01:45:19] know what's gonna happen so you don't judge a book by it's cover yeah I mean Dean
[01:45:23] you'd be less apt to slap than you would Jeff Glover I guess that's a good
[01:45:27] point Dean you can kind of judge by the cover yeah the cover is pretty evident but
[01:45:31] Jeffy or Joel yeah you know those guys weigh 150 pounds and you know a surfer
[01:45:38] guy and a whatever Jeff is I don't know what genre of human you put Jeff into
[01:45:43] but you wouldn't think that he would throw a dars choke on your face so that's
[01:45:53] that prioritize an execute in the jiu jitsu I mean we just talked about it
[01:45:58] 14 times tonight for combat talk about in business all the time you got to
[01:46:02] make sure that the initiatives that you're running you don't have 38
[01:46:05] initiatives and you jitsu guess what you hear this all the time you're
[01:46:08] getting about to get choked you got to protect your neck number one you got to
[01:46:12] protect your neck yeah then you can worry about your leg and then you can
[01:46:15] worry about your arm and the hooks and everything else which got to protect the
[01:46:17] neck you got to prioritize yeah gotta keep things simple you got to create
[01:46:25] you got to have an open mind you got to be creative and look for different ways
[01:46:31] to win and different things to do you got to make sure you don't get trapped in
[01:46:35] your ruts mentally trapped in a rut this happens to me everybody yeah
[01:46:42] happens to me but I only know what I can tell you about me and then as I get
[01:46:45] trapped in ruts with your jitsu where I get I get stuck in something and I'll
[01:46:51] just go with one move for a long period of time you got to be careful that I
[01:46:56] need to be better about that discipline equals freedom so with you jitsu the
[01:47:05] more disciplined you are in training the more freedom you have on the mat so
[01:47:11] the more you train the more you work the more you drill the more you can move
[01:47:16] the more you can escape the more you can create the more you can finish you
[01:47:21] and not to mention the fear that it eliminates because like you know I'll
[01:47:26] like let's say you're not that discipline you take two weeks off a lot of
[01:47:28] time when you come back from that two weeks like you have that added element of
[01:47:32] nervousness like dang am I gonna gas or am I gonna get you know tapped out in front
[01:47:37] of everybody when you know when you know maybe there's a higher expectation on
[01:47:41] me or something like that yeah no I don't have that yeah part of it though
[01:47:53] for sure but I would say the number one philosophical lesson I guess is
[01:47:58] the philosophical lesson is the same thing that I learned from combat and that's
[01:48:04] humility in jitsu is absolutely one of the most humbling experiences in the
[01:48:10] world and we've actually I got people now that have started jiu jitsu
[01:48:13] because the podcast and they say oh I just did my first jiu jitsu class damn
[01:48:19] that was humbling it is extremely humbling you're gonna get be you're never
[01:48:25] gonna know everything you're always gonna be learning that there's other ways
[01:48:30] to do things and somebody that just started can come up with amazing techniques
[01:48:36] and that's humbling and there's other martial arts that have better moves
[01:48:43] that you need to pay attention to like wrestling has better take downs like
[01:48:47] sombo with the leg locks and catch wrestling some of those things that are
[01:48:52] better moves and you need to apply those and guess what you still need to know
[01:48:56] how to strike because it can be hard to take people down so you know how to
[01:49:01] how to strike and you can't be cocky and you can't be over confident because
[01:49:06] the bottom line is in jiu jitsu you will get beat and you will get beat by
[01:49:14] smaller guys by weaker guys by older guys you're gonna get beat and there's
[01:49:22] somebody that's better than you and if you don't like that or if your ego
[01:49:30] doesn't like that then you gotta find a new game to play yeah because you need
[01:49:38] to find a softer game or an easier game because jiu jitsu is honest yeah and
[01:49:46] you cannot escape that and that's as it should be and it's of course this
[01:49:51] philosophical this philosophy is something that I definitely carried over to
[01:49:57] combat and carry over to when I talk to businesses and carry over to life you
[01:50:03] can't be over confident you can't be over confident you're never gonna think
[01:50:06] you know everything you have to respect the enemy that's part of humility you
[01:50:12] got to respect your if you're not humble you don't respect your enemy you don't
[01:50:14] respect your opponent you don't respect your competitor and if you don't that's
[01:50:23] when you're gonna get caught so to me humility is the most important thing
[01:50:28] that jiu jitsu teaches you yeah and you know it's kind of a can be kind of
[01:50:35] but not a trick yeah I'll have a call to the tricks because okay you got
[01:50:42] it you got to maintain the humility right but that humility will be tested if
[01:50:46] you stick with it so I don't tell you a little quick story about that test being
[01:50:50] stood upon me it was like a little after I got my purple belt I was really
[01:50:58] like really hit my stride I was competing a lot in winning and you were
[01:51:03] trained with me a lot back yes that was that was right at that time when I was
[01:51:07] training with you and you were you know when I you know if there was a
[01:51:12] little mentorship going on yeah that was the exact time yeah and and I was like
[01:51:19] yeah I started to kind of you know give me into my own height you know like oh
[01:51:22] I'm the man not outwardly but on the inside and just fun jiu jitsu man gets
[01:51:30] cocky on the inside yeah and here's thing a lot of people that's how you know
[01:51:35] it in fact a little bit of that is good because you get a confidence that
[01:51:38] hunger to even learn more and be better so I had that and then Greg and
[01:51:42] rolled with Greg since I did know him as good but I knew him but not as good as I
[01:51:47] do now and last time I wanted to say the last time I rolled with him I was a
[01:51:50] white belt long time ago and he just would destroy me so I was like Greg's like oh
[01:51:56] yeah you know congratulations you know you've been winning and stuff like that
[01:51:58] was like oh yeah he's like all right yeah let's roll so I'm like I let me
[01:52:02] chill yeah I'm thinking in my mind yeah I've been winning here let me go
[01:52:07] ahead and show you my new stuff you know it's gonna show Greg in my own
[01:52:10] mind yeah and Greg took me like I was a white belt again immediately the kind
[01:52:16] where he literally nothing I did work and everything he did work there's like
[01:52:19] it's like he did a step one step two step three tap me out step one
[01:52:23] step two set tap me out and that was the time where I got put from like the
[01:52:30] top of the mountain in my own head right to the bottom of the mountain literally
[01:52:34] to the bottom not to not almost at the bottom to the bottom of the mountain yeah
[01:52:37] that's that's it's actually it's actually so good when that happens and
[01:52:42] and actually it's something I occasionally do you get to super humbling occasionally
[01:52:47] you get someone that is really really good and they don't recognize they don't
[01:52:55] come up against people all the time that are they don't come up against
[01:52:59] people very often that are better than them yeah most people in the beginning
[01:53:05] you have you have several years of of being beat down but occasionally
[01:53:10] you get something that's a great wrestler or maybe they were a judo player or
[01:53:13] something so they come into the game or they're just super strong or they're
[01:53:16] just a freak athlete and so they very quickly you know in a matter of six
[01:53:20] months to a year all of a sudden they're doing really well yeah sometimes those
[01:53:24] people sometimes those people mentally they might be good at your jitzie but
[01:53:28] they don't they don't mentally get it and they become really bullies and that's
[01:53:33] that's that's one of the it doesn't happen that often like I said but it
[01:53:37] doesn't occasionally happen where you get somebody that just is a dominant
[01:53:40] force they don't get humble enough and and they don't because even if you
[01:53:45] don't actually get humbled jiu jitsu normally in the beginning you learn
[01:53:48] like oh because one of the things I say to people is I'm not you know because
[01:53:53] I can tap you but doesn't mean that I'm a better human than you just means I
[01:53:57] train more jiu jitsu than you this you know what I mean that's all it means and
[01:54:01] that means that someone else has trained in jiu jiu more than me and they
[01:54:05] can beat me and that's just what it is but sometimes people think that because
[01:54:09] they can tap somebody out that they're better than them yeah as a human yeah
[01:54:15] there is a spirit and that's not a good attitude to have that's not what you
[01:54:19] jiu jitsu should be about yeah and those guys a lot of times because they
[01:54:22] and this is just kind of a one way to put it they don't pay their dues so to speak
[01:54:27] you know like a normal way they don't get the humility lesson over and over and
[01:54:30] over again they get it like a few times within the overcomment quickly yeah and
[01:54:33] it out ways that way yeah so you gotta be careful of that yeah just just be just
[01:54:40] be careful that if you're if you're a person that's naturally really a depth of
[01:54:43] jiu jitsu make sure you're not getting turning into a bully yeah and a lot of
[01:54:49] times that can block you from learning oh definitely block you because it's like
[01:54:52] why would I why would I start learning all this weirdo game like if you're
[01:54:55] strong wrestler like why would I start learning bottom game yeah if when I'm
[01:55:00] killing with all this other stuff I mean listen because there's someone that's a better
[01:55:03] wrestler than you yeah that's why or just knows the combination because a lot of times
[01:55:07] certain guys they'll they'll know the combo to beat wrestling yeah without having to do
[01:55:13] wrestling yeah make some guys that they're just like that you know so part of it
[01:55:18] jiu jitsu okay next question have you ever been so dug in on a solution or an
[01:55:25] opinion that it felt impossible to admit that you were in fact wrong
[01:55:29] so I actually almost gave up on this question and and
[01:55:37] because it's been I learned this lesson a long time ago that again the humility that you
[01:55:43] get from jiu jitsu and from combat and from life is that I very seldom dig in on
[01:55:52] something that I'm not 100% sure of yeah and and which means I don't dig in on a
[01:55:56] lot because I'm not a 100% sure of much right who can be a 100% sure of a lot of things
[01:56:01] and when I do do that it's not that hard for me to realize that I'm wrong
[01:56:05] stifle my ego admit it in change course it's not that big of a deal to me
[01:56:11] when I like I said when I do dig in on a subject or on a decision it's because I know
[01:56:17] like almost to a 100% certainty that I'm right otherwise I'm gonna leave myself a little bit of an
[01:56:22] out I'm not gonna just dig in on things that I can't be positive about because why
[01:56:29] would I why would I do that now when I end up being wrong if I do take a stance on
[01:56:36] something it's no big deal I'm gonna use that as an opportunity to show that I'm
[01:56:40] humble and show that I can admit when I'm wrong I'm gonna take advantage of a good
[01:56:43] I'm wrong good and you know so I would say just keep your options open keep an
[01:56:51] open mind when you feel yourself or your ego is digging in just check yourself
[01:57:00] and admit that you're wrong and move on and one thing I think that happens with people is people
[01:57:10] think that digging in and having a strong 100% opinion makes them a pure stronger or it makes
[01:57:20] their idea pure stronger but I don't think so I'm not saying to be wishy washy on stuff
[01:57:25] I'm just saying I don't have an open mind because I think that's the ultimate strength
[01:57:31] that's kind of my opinion I mean the last time I came close to digging in I was advising a company
[01:57:36] and they were going through some rough a little bit of a rough patch and they started multiple
[01:57:42] initiatives to try and turn some some things around and one of the initiatives
[01:57:47] of all the initiatives there was a couple that the CEO wanted done immediately and two of
[01:57:53] those initiatives when I looked at them I thought that they were redundant and so I said look
[01:58:00] I wouldn't waste I wouldn't do both these initiatives just pick one I think this one's the
[01:58:04] better one just do this one and I think it'll cover the problem and I convinced them
[01:58:10] and it was pretty easy to convince them because they were had limited resources at the time
[01:58:13] and limited assets so it wasn't like they had a bunch of stuff to spread around
[01:58:16] but he was pretty sad on it but I convinced them otherwise and he agreed and within a matter of
[01:58:20] days it started to look like I was wrong and it started to look like both systems were going to
[01:58:25] be needed to solve that specific issue so I didn't like wait I didn't say oh I hope that things go
[01:58:35] I said look hey I think I was wrong about this I think you were right let's get the other
[01:58:39] initiative going and let's get this problem covered and that's it and I'm telling you he didn't
[01:58:45] lose respect for me because I said hey I'm wrong after a few days of watching what the results are
[01:58:52] and making an early decision he actually thought it was awesome and he knew he's like hey I wish
[01:59:00] everyone could admit when they were wrong like that it would make everything around here so much
[01:59:04] easier and I said well that's why I'm here in the first place right is to help with that so
[01:59:10] just be conscious when you dig in you know because when you dig in you're actually when you
[01:59:15] dig in you're taking away your ability to maneuver oh yeah you don't want to do that it's good so
[01:59:22] so watch out now should I read this question because this is a question for echo Charles
[01:59:32] so that means I get you well it's two questions actually but I put them together because they're
[01:59:36] pretty close jocca willing what brought you and echo Charles together can we get the backstory there
[01:59:44] I like the chemistry echo Charles question for you to answer on jocco podcast what have you
[01:59:52] learned from jocco and how has your life changed since this is echo's first response to a question
[02:00:03] don't screw it up here we go I'll tackle you yeah yeah of course which is funny because that's kind
[02:00:12] of how what brought us together we're a part of what brought us together and I think it's good
[02:00:16] that I answer this part because you probably remember a lot less of it so
[02:00:24] I would say it was oh six I'd seen you like the first you know whatever within the first year
[02:00:31] of joining with Dean in 05 but I didn't know you didn't talk to you nothing like that I just
[02:00:36] had heard of you from Dean and then in like 06 when we moved over to the boxing club I rolled
[02:00:43] with you one time I was still a white belt and so that could have been still 05 I don't know and then
[02:00:50] you know you beat me up and you kind of you were just more like this stoic guy basically I would
[02:00:56] imagine the same guy that people interpret you to be from the outside you know kind of like not
[02:01:01] intense but just real like yeah just real matter of fact you know so you beat me up or whatever and
[02:01:06] then I was so I since I had already heard of you were Dean's black belt and you know all this stuff
[02:01:11] that I was like yeah that's about right you know he's you know good you do whatever beat me up
[02:01:16] but that wasn't really saying much because everyone was beating me up and then time went on I didn't
[02:01:20] see you for a while and then when I started to kind of get lost I was trained with Brent
[02:01:26] Brent yeah I was training with him and then with Alias a little bit and then I would come back
[02:01:33] I was competing and then you were just around for whatever reason and then yeah I just started
[02:01:38] training with you and I think that's the one we opened victory right yes is around the same time yeah
[02:01:44] yeah exactly and then um yeah well funny is that you never came off like once like like new you like
[02:01:51] immediately you never came off as this super intense person like it was more like you were just
[02:01:56] sarcastic like well you know like any other like any other of my friends but you could still always
[02:02:03] tell that there are something behind the scenes you know you know Darrogens said like he's seeing you
[02:02:07] and he was like there's I don't know this guy you know it's kind of got that same feeling but you
[02:02:12] were always just like oh yeah this real matter fact but fun funny like kind of person whatever
[02:02:20] like but when I say matter fact I mean like um like that one this one tournament when uh it was kind
[02:02:26] of later where I lost two genre Roberts and you got me with a go-go plata and you know when you
[02:02:31] lose in jujitsu training and that was the first time I lost in since I went advance you know because
[02:02:36] those doing a lot of no-gui I had never lost and genre Roberts gets me with a go-go plata so instead of
[02:02:42] you saying hey you know it's okay here nothing like that you send me a text you're sitting across
[02:02:46] the arena you're right there you send me a text hey you got caught with a go-go that's got a sting
[02:02:51] that's not a tournament it's not practice you can say that could stuff it was like oh whatever
[02:02:57] but I think that um that you know training together and just kind of getting you you you kind of
[02:03:03] had that thing that you could say that kind of stuff because really it's not that serious you know
[02:03:09] yeah when I don't think I don't there's there's not many people who could have conveyed that though
[02:03:14] you know it came it I think it had to come from you anyway so yeah that's kind of how
[02:03:21] we met and then um kind of after a while how did the idea of a podcast come up because we we kind
[02:03:29] of talked about that a little bit before I kind of forget the formation but it was in my mind
[02:03:35] when I went on jailroguins I think we had talked about hey you know we should do something I think
[02:03:40] you said to me like hey you should do it and so when I went on jailroguins and he said you should do a
[02:03:45] podcast I think what Tim Ferriss said hey you should do a podcast and then I kind of be you being
[02:03:50] a techie sound guy video guy I just said hey do you know how to make a podcast yeah that's right
[02:03:56] I just said hey how do you you know how to make a podcast so I need to make one yeah
[02:03:59] yeah yeah because everything to be just a total caveman right get how do you do I need a tape recorder
[02:04:05] what do I need you know that's what my answer then you said yeah I know I know how to do that I could
[02:04:11] make that happen and then you said it'd be cool instead of just you sitting there talking if you
[02:04:18] had someone to talk to and I said yeah you're right that would be cool and then you said it'd be cool
[02:04:22] if it was me yeah well my my selling point was that strange if it's just you right just sitting there
[02:04:30] you know it's it's more strange and it's better if you have someone to kind of bounce things off
[02:04:34] okay especially someone who can kind of be like oh I'm just every day guy like so I can like
[02:04:39] ask questions that kind of reiterate the point right just someone who might not get it
[02:04:43] yeah I had an awful lot out you know in my mind I did anyway but yeah then yeah obviously Joe
[02:04:49] Rogan was kind of the tipping point when he suggested it yeah yeah no that was a good gradient
[02:04:55] side from Joe Rogan and I'm glad he did and I'm glad you did and look at we did
[02:04:59] make this podcast happen so to answer the question what have I learned and this is interesting
[02:05:07] because I asked myself this exact same question like a week ago because I am literally a different
[02:05:12] person in ways that kind of are kind of surprising in a way so I'd say the first thing that's kind
[02:05:18] of kind of not that surprising but it's it's very prevalent is when people blame when I see people
[02:05:25] blaming other people or blaming me or I feel the compulsion to blame someone else it stands out
[02:05:31] like a sore thumb almost like if if I've been feeling that and it like almost like if I want to say
[02:05:37] something to to indicate that I'm going to blame someone or something it's almost like a red flag like
[02:05:43] I'm not allowed to do that in my own mind it's like it's hard in fast rule and like I said they just
[02:05:48] stand out like a sore thumb everywhere though on TV you know the guy not even my conversation oh I
[02:05:54] see what you're doing right there you know so it's like it's like your whole way of life in that
[02:05:59] regard is just shifted extreme ownership and the awareness of that seeing it and other people
[02:06:06] or lack of it and other people definitely stands out like crazy once you start thinking about it
[02:06:10] yeah and I have the luxury of being around you talking about these things talking about examples of it
[02:06:16] every week right so throughout the week I'm like I can't even help but notice it you know and it's
[02:06:21] right it helps man because it applies to everyone and everything like most relationships are going to
[02:06:26] apply these principles you know if you're involved in them so yeah it's all automatic now so so
[02:06:33] when it comes to ownership and really blaming myself if anyone and focusing on my responsibility
[02:06:40] in any scenario whatever it comes automatic now I would say so huge stuff I mean whether I make
[02:06:45] the right choices that's always going to be working probably progress I think but as far as that attitude
[02:06:50] it's automatic now that's awesome and then in regards to okay so I've always been into working
[02:07:00] out and so me not feeling like working out is I've always felt like working out so
[02:07:11] as far as not feeling like it that wasn't really a factor but in a bunch of other things in life
[02:07:16] it was a factor and so so you're saying we're not feeling like doing this and why you're
[02:07:24] seeing yeah like oh I got it I got to go to the post office today and that's on the low end and then
[02:07:29] or the other one is I don't know I get it I don't know something more important right but maybe
[02:07:34] I'll wait a wait till really the last minute or we know procrastination type stuff so you're getting
[02:07:40] into the here and now yeah and not feeling like it that means absolutely nothing something needs
[02:07:46] to be done and I don't feel like it and you know how like you have certain ideas already and then
[02:07:52] other ideas are introduced and then those ideas kind of mingle with your existing ideas and they
[02:07:57] formulate this whole new course of action right so the not feeling like it is no excuse that idea
[02:08:03] came in and so now like it morphed into this thing like me not feeling like it who guess what I'm
[02:08:10] going to do I'm going to do it right so it's almost like this personal challenge now you know and
[02:08:15] man as far as results go and you get everything done I get it so much stuff done and it's not
[02:08:20] some probably compared to you it's nothing but I get stuff done like so many things done during
[02:08:26] the day that I never thought that I could do that many things in a day that's all I'm always looking
[02:08:30] for maybe a rest or a nap or something like that but now everyone's all all be challenging myself
[02:08:35] to do as many things as I can and be like solid and on top of that and you're the one who said this
[02:08:41] was one time one of the things you were kind of tired and you were like you know what what I like
[02:08:46] this I like just grinding and grinding and grinding and then at the end of the day when I go
[02:08:50] it go to bed where my head just crashes into the pillow I like that and I was like yeah that sounds
[02:08:55] nice you know so when I approach things like that now and also I think of all the good things that have
[02:09:03] been done like great things and just good things whatever if these people didn't do it because they
[02:09:08] didn't feel like it like these things when they got done you know so if you got stuff to do
[02:09:15] you do it whether you feel like it or not that's what I have for myself now and the last thing
[02:09:24] is I kind of knew this but man it's so clear now that you can get certain messages and
[02:09:30] information and tips and tactics and stuff from from people or the internet or books or whatever
[02:09:36] but if you're not ready to accept them you just won't accept them or they'll just go in one
[02:09:44] year and out the other and a lot of time that has to do with who's saying it so
[02:09:49] if like I don't know your neighbor some goof off he's drinking a beer smoking a cigarette
[02:09:54] he's like hey guess what you know you should do this and it's that it can be this great advice
[02:09:58] being like I'm not going to listen to you I'm not even a listen to you I'm not even going to
[02:10:02] get past that part the fact that you're the one that saying this already walled me off from what
[02:10:07] you have to say and that's natural I think but a lot of these things like you're reading these old
[02:10:13] books that have these messages that you've been saying so it's not new stuff and a lot of stuff
[02:10:18] I heard that take responsibility for for your actions yeah that's not new you know if I
[02:10:23] bust out hey hey you guy on the street take responsibility for your actions if something comes
[02:10:28] up I'm just saying he'd be like yeah that's nothing new I wouldn't stand out but for some reason when
[02:10:33] you're saying it get you thinking yeah let me take responsibility you know so that so yeah it's say
[02:10:41] when it comes to listening to you this podcast all the you know the answers you have for these
[02:10:47] questions and any questions I even have it seems like it it comes and a process it way more readily
[02:10:55] than you know memes on Facebook or wherever you know say that that's awesome pretty true that's
[02:11:04] that's really cool that's that's great to hear and I've I mean I've definitely seen a transition
[02:11:11] in everything you're doing I mean everything you're doing is spot on yeah and that's legit you know
[02:11:18] it's legit to see it's legit to see someone moving towards their potential as a human yeah that's
[02:11:26] awesome to see yeah and another thing that kind of I came to as not a conclusion but it which is
[02:11:34] a result it's not a direct like you didn't tell me this but this is what all my existing thoughts
[02:11:39] mixed with all your input kind of arrived at one of the things is that it's up to you it's up to me
[02:11:46] what I spend my time doing totally up to me and it's up to me what I feel my head with so you know
[02:11:55] I like I used to have these shows that I love to I love to watch Hawaii 50 and Shark Tank and that's
[02:12:01] kind of it I don't really watch that much TV but those do that's maybe you know two hours or so
[02:12:08] that I could be reading something that's gonna help me through the rest of my life or getting better
[02:12:13] at something that's gonna help my you know relationships or career or something like that and I
[02:12:19] use that example because that seems pretty pretty like not in consequence because it's only two
[02:12:26] shows it's not like I spent 10 hours a day watching TV it's just two shows because no harm in that
[02:12:30] right but it's that's up to me I'm not missing out by missing Hawaii 50 not missing out that's not
[02:12:35] gonna affect my life in any negative way in the future at all I don't want to affect my life in
[02:12:39] any way actually but if I read something useful educate myself in you know whatever arena that's
[02:12:47] gonna improve my interests or my or my relationship or something like that that will that will help
[02:12:53] me yeah no I've that's one of the things I've noticed when I'd show show up at the studio
[02:12:58] and you'd say all's reading this book today about you know how we could get this to sound better
[02:13:03] and I read this thing about you know you're coming back and me with all this information
[02:13:07] and it was something that just transitioned in your brain where you said you know what I could be
[02:13:14] watching TV in wasting my mind or I could be applying myself and learning yeah and that's
[02:13:23] that makes a huge difference yeah this is what one of the things I read actually
[02:13:28] and I read it on I want to say Wikipedia this specific thing but there's this this automatic
[02:13:34] way of thinking and it's called hyperbolic discounting right and all that it all that means is
[02:13:42] you choose immediate payoffs versus and I kind of mentioned this before you choose immediate
[02:13:46] payoffs versus long-term payoffs right and it's there for a reason survival mechanism and all these
[02:13:51] ways but it's all that exists for an you know an environment that's not current so if you can
[02:13:58] basically be aware of that and combat that where don't do the immediate payoff things so
[02:14:04] just take take what you're about to do evaluated is this going to help me other than the pleasure
[02:14:08] that I think well whether that in regards to food drinking TV shows like if you watch reality TV
[02:14:17] check yourself on now and ask yourself is this going to help me in the future and typically
[02:14:24] that that answer for those types of things you're going to be know and then consider in alternative
[02:14:29] that you can do and a lot of the stuff can be pleasurable that will help you in the future and it's
[02:14:35] totally up to you it's totally up to you why not make the good choice yeah and the payoff not only
[02:14:40] is it bigger it lasts longer yeah and the immediate payoff is gone it's just a memory
[02:14:48] awesome that's awesome to hear and and actually we got that next comment here is sort of the same
[02:14:56] vein that's coming from and we get a bunch of you know emails but I just thought this one was
[02:15:02] was interesting to hear someone kind of talking about their transition here she says I'm one of
[02:15:08] many many people who live their lives as they think they should and end up mid 40s lost
[02:15:15] chubby and depressed I definitely don't hear a worship you but I'm truly grateful
[02:15:22] for your online presence I now get up at 5 a.m. daily and I screened grab my phone every morning
[02:15:29] as the alarm goes off and post that shot with another shot from my walk a few minutes in
[02:15:35] I walk for an hour daily and it started stretching daily for an hour but this doesn't stop there
[02:15:41] I now have a bunch of friends who are getting up early and going for a walk or going to the gym
[02:15:46] getting after it as you say we are all noticing an improvement in our lives so we might not be
[02:15:53] military or police we are not planning on becoming jiu jitsu champions at this stage we're just
[02:15:59] people who lost themselves lost their way who are finding their way back in part thanks to you
[02:16:09] I credit you at least twice a week and tell people to find you on Twitter I had to write here
[02:16:14] because there's no way I could fit this into 140 characters and thanks to Tim and Joe for having
[02:16:19] you on their shows that's where I found you have a great day so it really cool you know really cool
[02:16:25] to hear that really great to get that feedback and you know this is what I like about it
[02:16:33] but first of all you know I thank people who spread the words and it's really good to hear
[02:16:36] that feedback it fires me up to hear the feedback and when people say I motivate them I'm always
[02:16:41] like you motivate me you know that motivates me that you're out there getting up at 5 a.m.
[02:16:47] and turning your life around I think that's awesome and also what I what I liked about this
[02:16:53] was they pointed out that this isn't just military or police or jiu jitsu players it's for
[02:16:58] pretty much anybody in any station in life and any job any age man or woman any country and
[02:17:05] as a matter of fact I was in England and my wife from England and when I was in England I went and saw
[02:17:11] one of my wife's friends who I'm friends with the husband and you know here's this woman
[02:17:19] who's I don't know 40 something years old she's lives in England she's got three kids
[02:17:28] she's like couldn't be any further detached from me in my life
[02:17:33] and when I was I was hanging out with her husband in London before we went to their house
[02:17:39] and he said when we got on the train to go to his house he said listen you got to be ready
[02:17:43] and I'm like for what and he says my wife loves your podcast and I said really
[02:17:49] and he said no no no I'm serious she loves your podcast and we have dinner night she's going to
[02:17:54] ask you questions all my long she's been asking me the questions that she was going to ask you
[02:17:58] and so I showed up and seriously it was great she was asking me all these detailed questions about
[02:18:04] everything and it was really cool because I realized that this I mean this like I said this person
[02:18:09] doesn't do due to jitsu doesn't you know doesn't do anything that I do nothing
[02:18:17] and yet she was had all these lessons learned and all these things she had taken away and
[02:18:21] it was awesome to see that and it was an interesting too because that's I was talking to her
[02:18:25] it was on a Friday or a Saturday and as I'm talking to her she had listened to the latest podcast
[02:18:32] on the day before and so she was saying to me you know well yesterday you said this and yesterday
[02:18:38] you said that and so in her mind I was talking to her yesterday I was talking to her yesterday
[02:18:45] and that's when I kind of realized that how how impactful is what we talked about where you know
[02:18:51] where the words the podcast words are going directly into your brain and I've had a bunch of
[02:18:55] people say you know oh when you're talking oh you were telling this story and I wanted you to talk
[02:18:59] about this story you know for these are friends of mine and so so I think that's that's really cool
[02:19:05] and I think that's why a lot of people are getting into the game and enjoying it because and you
[02:19:10] just said it and I I say it all the time there's nothing new here and we're not
[02:19:17] given out any ground breaking techniques and there's no miracle drug and there's no three-minute
[02:19:23] exercise that's going to change your life I'm not selling the self-help reach your potential
[02:19:35] through this magical mystery I'm telling people what they already know and we're talking about
[02:19:42] things that people know to be right in their own heads like discipline and hard work and consistency
[02:19:48] those are the things and we all know those things but to everybody that's that's kind of
[02:19:58] known these things for a while but they've recently started to get after it good on you
[02:20:05] yeah and get on that path yeah if it feels like stay on that path that's what I'm talking about
[02:20:13] very cool I feel like like just like how you were saying like we a lot of this we already knew
[02:20:19] we already know about state discipline we already know about all this stuff or whatever but coming from
[02:20:25] you it helps and then on top of that I'm really starting to really understand and feel is that
[02:20:34] you know all like you on Twitter like you engage you know you like someone asks your questions
[02:20:39] it seems like you're engaging a lot more so than if somebody asks me question I'm going to answer
[02:20:46] their question yeah I'm not rude which is it I try to for sure I would imagine you'd be you know
[02:20:51] I have way more than me but kind of as a result of everything I feel like we're all kind of doing
[02:20:56] this together you know you know how the guys done in Australia they'll post all that you know
[02:21:00] a lot of people everyone they're posting there you know 430 a.m. wake up time to do this
[02:21:06] everyone yeah because that's what you did now guess what we're all doing it you know we're all doing
[02:21:10] it you're responding they're responding to you you're responding to them we're reading questions
[02:21:14] from them yeah I think I'm a weird like these are other people yeah and through this weird
[02:21:22] interweb they're actually asking questions from some unknown partner hold we're having a
[02:21:27] conversation basically yeah it's kind of delayed but yeah that's exactly what's going on so
[02:21:31] an example I should have just grabbed my phone and saw the half forget the guy's name but he was like
[02:21:36] hey echo Sunday workout Sunday this was like early this morning maybe late last night whatever
[02:21:42] Sunday workout give me one I need a Sunday workout so I was like oh okay so I gave him the workout it was
[02:21:48] basically two rounds five sets of cleaning clean and press five reps clean and press five times
[02:21:58] and then five burpees that's one set do five sets 45 seconds rest in between rest for two minutes
[02:22:03] and then do five more 45 seconds rest that's it I said use 135 pounds I only said 135 pounds because
[02:22:09] that's what that's the exact thing I do after I live and that's like to me that's the hard
[02:22:12] lifting side that hard but that part's kind of hard to me the metcon the metcon yeah so I'm like
[02:22:19] but I don't know maybe I don't know if I'm in good shape or not as far as that goes so I think
[02:22:22] I say you do it and use that weight but here's the thing if he's smaller I don't know how big he is
[02:22:29] we're just talking on Twitter you know so you know that put the weight didn't really matter
[02:22:33] hopefully scaled it properly or he said later on he was like dang that was pain but I feel great
[02:22:38] I was like solid he said hey but I adjusted the weight so I'm saying okay you know that makes sense
[02:22:44] but my two reasons why I was into that is because I wanted that interaction like hey do my work up
[02:22:51] you know and what I'm gonna do and I thought it was earlier this morning where
[02:22:55] or earlier today I'm gonna send him back say you give me a workout oh nice and I'm gonna do it
[02:23:01] and but make it something at least close to what you do or something you do and I'll give you
[02:23:05] your evaluation you know so hopefully I can get some variety and it'll help that interaction I think
[02:23:10] that's dope yeah like how he actually went and did it yeah I was like heck yeah it's good that
[02:23:14] some barn in Iowa or some yellow it was awesome good deal last question there must be some aspect
[02:23:25] of the Tutsi situation that I don't understand even if I'm on the losing side of the fight I still
[02:23:30] want to go down swing I could tell how much this affected jacco it would suck to be so close to such
[02:23:37] an unjust fight and not be able to do anything about it yes it it is hard to look at that situation
[02:23:49] and really understand it and it's horrible look back at it now and know that we didn't do anything about it
[02:23:59] but what can we do with it how can we apply this to everyday life because I agree with you
[02:24:11] you gotta go down swinging and I'll tell you this if you if you fight with all you've got
[02:24:19] more often than not you go down at all you win but you gotta make that attitude part of your
[02:24:34] everyday life the extra rep the extra mile the extra round the right choices to make yourself
[02:24:43] stronger mentally and physically stand and fight fight against weakness and against fear
[02:24:57] their fight against time and decay fight back go down swing it
[02:25:06] give every day everything you've got and when you face a challenge even something where you
[02:25:17] don't believe you can win maybe to situation where you cannot win but if you can't win
[02:25:25] remember this you have nothing to lose so stand up and go forward and go out in a blaze of glory
[02:25:40] fighting with everything you've got every ounce of energy every beat is sweat and every drop of blood
[02:25:48] to your last breath and then and only then you can stand down and you can put down your
[02:26:04] sword and you can put down your shield and rest in peace and I think that's all I've got for the
[02:26:24] night so thanks all you troopers out there tuning in and listening and thanks for remembering
