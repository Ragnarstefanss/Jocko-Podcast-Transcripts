00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.20
This is Jocko podcast number 365 with echo Charles and me jockel willing. Good evening echo. Good evening

2
00:00:06.64 --> 00:00:09.48
Also joining us tonight Dave Burke. Good evening Dave. Good evening

3
00:00:10.74 --> 00:00:15.32
All of you here this evening are leaders. I am pleased to meet you

4
00:00:15.96 --> 00:00:19.16
What you do may well dignify the past

5
00:00:20.12 --> 00:00:22.12
explain today and

6
00:00:22.12 --> 00:00:24.12
Secure for all of us

7
00:00:24.20 --> 00:00:26.20
tomorrow

8
00:00:26.20 --> 00:00:32.48
That's a little excerpt from a speech that was given and

9
00:00:35.20 --> 00:00:40.84
Was captured and transcript from general of the army by the way

10
00:00:42.08 --> 00:00:44.08
General the army Omar Bradley

11
00:00:44.56 --> 00:00:48.60
Who Dave and I well, I mean the Bradley fighting vehicle?

12
00:00:49.04 --> 00:00:53.000
We we are very fond of the Bradley fighting vehicle. So Omar Bradley

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.04
We're gonna dig in this document, but a little bit about him

14
00:00:56.96 --> 00:00:58.96
born in a

15
00:00:59.72 --> 00:01:03.52
Little farming town in Clark, Missouri

16
00:01:04.20 --> 00:01:06.20
February 12th 1893

17
00:01:07.52 --> 00:01:11.42
Wicked poor parents very poor, but he got into West Point

18
00:01:12.68 --> 00:01:16.42
Went into West Point graduated in 1915

19
00:01:16.42 --> 00:01:24.24
Number 44 out of 164. It's only 164 people going to go into West Point in a class

20
00:01:24.74 --> 00:01:27.46
You know now it's like but I think it's about a thousand a class now

21
00:01:28.54 --> 00:01:34.50
So he graduated with that class of 1915 in which by the way, this is interesting this class the Eisenhower was in that class

22
00:01:34.50 --> 00:01:38.42
But 56 people in that class became generals

23
00:01:39.22 --> 00:01:41.78
One class of 164 people

24
00:01:41.78 --> 00:01:47.58
Became generals so they call that class the class that the stars fell on World War one

25
00:01:48.90 --> 00:01:53.30
He was in an infantry regiment, but he never left America. So didn't do anything

26
00:01:54.14 --> 00:01:56.14
So that's rough

27
00:01:56.46 --> 00:02:01.78
That was that's that's hard happen to some guys in the teams. They missed Vietnam and

28
00:02:02.38 --> 00:02:08.46
They were in the teams and there's nothing going on and then they got out of the teams September 11th happens. It's like a

29
00:02:08.46 --> 00:02:12.06
a bad deal a bad deal

30
00:02:12.06 --> 00:02:16.18
So he's in World War one happens. He just never leaves America in between

31
00:02:17.06 --> 00:02:19.06
the wars he's

32
00:02:20.86 --> 00:02:28.16
Going to you know various assignments spends a bunch of time as a student or a teacher at military schools makes Brigadier General in

33
00:02:28.78 --> 00:02:30.78
1941

34
00:02:30.78 --> 00:02:37.58
1942 to 1943 commands the 82nd and 28th Infantry Divisions March 1943

35
00:02:38.34 --> 00:02:40.50
March 1943

36
00:02:40.50 --> 00:02:46.74
He is requested by Eisenhower to go to North Africa and this is when he becomes the deputy commander

37
00:02:48.38 --> 00:02:52.14
Under patent which gets represented in the movie patent

38
00:02:53.22 --> 00:02:54.98
To core

39
00:02:54.98 --> 00:03:01.98
After that he's selected as the army group commander for D-Day for operation overlord D-Day and in D-Day

40
00:03:01.98 --> 00:03:03.66
He's on the ground

41
00:03:03.66 --> 00:03:08.50
Leading the fight through the the hedgerows of Normandy and then after the battle of St. Low

42
00:03:09.10 --> 00:03:14.90
August 1st. He takes command of the 12th Army Group and to the war. He's now a full general and

43
00:03:14.90 --> 00:03:24.22
By the way, check this out full general. He's in charge of overall in charge of 43 divisions

44
00:03:25.74 --> 00:03:27.74
1.3 million

45
00:03:27.74 --> 00:03:31.42
I think that's the largest army that has ever been assembled in America

46
00:03:32.78 --> 00:03:39.10
1945 comes back after war. He becomes the administrator for the for the Bureau of Veteran Affairs

47
00:03:39.10 --> 00:03:44.06
Gets on with that job 1948 back to the army

48
00:03:45.10 --> 00:03:47.42
1949 first chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

49
00:03:48.38 --> 00:03:51.26
So that's kind of a landmark role

50
00:03:52.22 --> 00:03:57.78
First chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 1950 of course Korea War starts in June in September

51
00:03:57.78 --> 00:04:04.70
He gets promoted to general of the army five-star. He's the fifth five-star general and the last five-star general we've had in America

52
00:04:04.70 --> 00:04:13.06
Army grows from 1950 to 1952 the whole army grows from 1.5 1.4 million troops to

53
00:04:13.86 --> 00:04:15.86
3.5 million troops

54
00:04:17.30 --> 00:04:23.98
Didn't really have a great relationship with MacArthur and I should say MacArthur didn't have a great relationship with him

55
00:04:25.02 --> 00:04:28.54
kind of convinces Truman to get rid of to fire General MacArthur and

56
00:04:28.54 --> 00:04:34.74
I I tried to figure out exactly what this meant. I read several different sources about this

57
00:04:34.74 --> 00:04:37.78
So he he stopped active service in

58
00:04:39.50 --> 00:04:45.86
1953 but he stayed on active duty. I guess it's because you're a five-star general you're like permanent like you're not going anywhere

59
00:04:46.18 --> 00:04:47.26
so

60
00:04:47.26 --> 00:04:49.26
He's still active duty

61
00:04:49.38 --> 00:04:53.70
Even though he's not maybe in the exact position, but he's still on active duty

62
00:04:53.70 --> 00:04:59.42
And then he just like chairs a bunch of you know chairs the the Commission on Veterans Pensions

63
00:05:00.50 --> 00:05:03.50
Member of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board

64
00:05:04.06 --> 00:05:10.50
His chairman of the board of below the watch. How do you say below the watch company below the below the below the say yeah

65
00:05:10.50 --> 00:05:14.06
Or but I've heard below but the boat. Okay. I don't know how to say it

66
00:05:14.62 --> 00:05:18.26
American company. Did you know that? No, I always thought it was a foreign company. No, it was American company

67
00:05:18.86 --> 00:05:20.86
Not made in America anymore. Unfortunately

68
00:05:20.86 --> 00:05:25.14
Um wrote a book called soldier story, which I'm sure we'll cover on here at some point

69
00:05:25.82 --> 00:05:29.10
He was a consultant in the movie

70
00:05:29.62 --> 00:05:33.26
Patent for the movie patent because of course Pat had died in what 1947

71
00:05:33.86 --> 00:05:38.46
Was even quicker. It's like 45 is like right after the war like the war was just barely over

72
00:05:38.46 --> 00:05:45.82
So Pat wasn't alive and and so he's a consultant on the movie patent and of course in the movie

73
00:05:45.82 --> 00:05:47.82
It shows them as kind of like

74
00:05:47.82 --> 00:05:50.98
Friends, you know close friends little different personalities

75
00:05:52.02 --> 00:05:57.10
But in reality they didn't get along apparently very well. He died April 8th

76
00:05:58.86 --> 00:06:01.94
1981 so that means he was on active duty

77
00:06:03.58 --> 00:06:11.54
From August 1st 1911 when he when he went to the when he went to West Point until April 8th 1981

78
00:06:11.54 --> 00:06:15.38
He was on active duty for 69 years eight months and seven days

79
00:06:15.38 --> 00:06:24.02
Obviously a ton of experience and like I said, I'm sure at some point we'll cover that whole book on the podcast

80
00:06:25.58 --> 00:06:31.90
But I was reading this transcript the other day because he had visited the Carlisle barracks

81
00:06:31.90 --> 00:06:33.90
which is where the army war colleges and

82
00:06:34.34 --> 00:06:37.66
He had stopped by to talk to some students about leadership

83
00:06:38.18 --> 00:06:44.74
And he had some great insights there that I thought it'd be worth sitting down and covering

84
00:06:44.74 --> 00:06:47.06
So let's get into it

85
00:06:48.38 --> 00:06:53.18
Omar Bradley five-star general stopping by to talk to your class about leadership. What do you got?

86
00:06:53.66 --> 00:06:59.18
So he starts off like I said, I use already already all of you here this evening our leaders

87
00:06:59.18 --> 00:07:05.94
I'm pleased to meet you what you do may well dignify the past explain today and secure for all of us tomorrow

88
00:07:05.94 --> 00:07:07.94
So that's how we that's how we kind of kicks this thing off

89
00:07:07.94 --> 00:07:15.94
Then he says perhaps I can touch upon a few factors that will underscore the value of good leadership

90
00:07:16.54 --> 00:07:22.34
Leadership is intangible no weapon no impersonal piece of machinery ever designed can take its place

91
00:07:23.02 --> 00:07:25.02
Now he didn't have AI yet

92
00:07:25.58 --> 00:07:27.10
Right

93
00:07:27.10 --> 00:07:31.02
No, he did not he did not have AI. No AI is getting close man

94
00:07:32.18 --> 00:07:36.50
Have you seen the chat GBT? You know I'm talking about no, what is that?

95
00:07:36.50 --> 00:07:40.78
It's like this AI that's writing things for people. Oh, yeah, do you see the AI art?

96
00:07:41.14 --> 00:07:44.70
Yep, yeah, I try and now everyone's like doing their thing whatever

97
00:07:44.70 --> 00:07:47.30
But doesn't AI kind of defeat the whole purpose of art though

98
00:07:47.42 --> 00:07:53.78
Yeah, kind of and the other thing of that I've noticed about AI art people that have posted AI art of themselves

99
00:07:53.78 --> 00:08:00.46
Is it's basically the most completely like fantasized vision of yourself you could ever have?

100
00:08:01.14 --> 00:08:05.42
Like hey, it's it's me Jocko except for I

101
00:08:05.42 --> 00:08:07.42
You know just like a

102
00:08:08.34 --> 00:08:12.94
270 pound shredded six foot five dude with like

103
00:08:13.58 --> 00:08:20.78
That's pretty much what it is. Yes, sir. Yeah, that's probably written into the AI like they probably like plump your lips

104
00:08:20.78 --> 00:08:26.56
Oh to get you to get you to like the picture and post it and spread it got it from red

105
00:08:26.56 --> 00:08:30.62
And that's how it what do you call one that AI takes over like info. That's how it like

106
00:08:30.62 --> 00:08:38.58
Disseminates right that's how it like freaking propagates itself. Yeah, so he's saying there's no machine that can take its place

107
00:08:38.58 --> 00:08:41.46
But I'll tell you what you can definitely make some incredible

108
00:08:43.22 --> 00:08:48.92
Calculations using artificial intelligence. I think you're always gonna have a little sanity check on things

109
00:08:49.94 --> 00:08:51.18
but

110
00:08:51.18 --> 00:08:53.18
according to Omar Bradley in

111
00:08:54.14 --> 00:08:58.02
1971 which is when he made the speech they're never gonna be able to replace leadership

112
00:08:58.02 --> 00:09:03.06
He goes on to say this is the age of the computer you wasn't kidding

113
00:09:03.78 --> 00:09:07.46
And if you know how to program the machine you can get quick and accurate answers

114
00:09:07.46 --> 00:09:12.84
But how can you include leadership and morale which is affected by leadership into your programming?

115
00:09:13.94 --> 00:09:15.94
You actually can do some of that right?

116
00:09:16.74 --> 00:09:19.90
Some of it. Yeah, you have to be able to right? Yeah, fully

117
00:09:21.98 --> 00:09:27.98
Let us never forget the great importance of this element leadership and while we use computers for certain answers

118
00:09:27.98 --> 00:09:35.90
Let us not try to fight a whole war or even a single battle without giving proper consideration to the element of leadership

119
00:09:36.06 --> 00:09:38.06
I'm gonna concur with that

120
00:09:38.82 --> 00:09:45.98
Another element to be considered is the man to be led and with whose morale we are concerned I

121
00:09:46.82 --> 00:09:52.30
Am constantly reminded of this point by a cartoon which hangs over my desk at home

122
00:09:52.30 --> 00:09:58.58
Which depicts an infantryman with his rifle across his knees as he sits behind a parapet

123
00:09:59.82 --> 00:10:05.82
Above him is the list of the newest weapons science has devised and the soldier behind the parapet is saying

124
00:10:06.66 --> 00:10:10.98
But still they haven't found the substitute for me

125
00:10:12.66 --> 00:10:14.66
Now I'm gonna tell you they're getting closer. I

126
00:10:15.26 --> 00:10:18.62
Mean you Dave Burke you're all but replaced

127
00:10:18.62 --> 00:10:21.86
You've been beating the the the

128
00:10:22.86 --> 00:10:27.06
Aviation AI drum for a while. This is not like this. This is not like a new thing

129
00:10:27.06 --> 00:10:29.12
I you've been thinking about we've been talked we talked about this

130
00:10:29.12 --> 00:10:34.66
We have and I am of I still think of the minority mindset that we're one airplane away from

131
00:10:34.98 --> 00:10:41.42
No longer having man fighters. Wait, there's who thinks that we're do people think we're more than that. Yes, I think so

132
00:10:41.42 --> 00:10:43.42
Oh really? I think I

133
00:10:43.42 --> 00:10:50.18
Don't have any data to back this up other than just conversations. I think most people in aviation think we have more

134
00:10:50.50 --> 00:10:55.94
Man fighters to build. I think we have one more. I think it's not would not surprise me if we built one more

135
00:10:56.18 --> 00:10:58.26
One more past the F-35. Yes

136
00:10:58.90 --> 00:11:05.34
One more you think you're gonna need another manned aircraft past the F-35. No, I don't oh you don't I do not

137
00:11:05.34 --> 00:11:09.54
I'm telling you I would not be surprised if the next one that they're designing now is the last man fighter

138
00:11:09.54 --> 00:11:11.62
Okay, it would not it would not surprise me at all

139
00:11:11.62 --> 00:11:13.62
I think a lot of people would say no way

140
00:11:14.82 --> 00:11:19.86
The other the other interesting thing is there's a dynamic where you there's no reason to even have a

141
00:11:20.18 --> 00:11:24.50
Big aircraft like that, right? I mean you could just make smaller multiple smaller aircraft

142
00:11:24.50 --> 00:11:28.78
Yeah, there's a whole lot of things happening right now like I forgot what the terms

143
00:11:28.78 --> 00:11:35.58
But basically they're even looking at F-35 certainly the next iteration of fighters is I think they call it like the swarm

144
00:11:35.58 --> 00:11:38.02
Which is all these you know smaller?

145
00:11:38.02 --> 00:11:45.06
Drones or you know remote pilots that this lead pilot, you know when an actual aircraft might have a bunch of control over

146
00:11:45.06 --> 00:11:49.42
But the swarm is always unmanned aviation, you know centric vehicles working with that person

147
00:11:50.58 --> 00:11:57.30
the progress that they made with drones in like a few years was insane

148
00:11:57.42 --> 00:11:58.82
Yeah

149
00:11:58.82 --> 00:12:02.02
We had one we had these drones in task unit bruiser

150
00:12:02.02 --> 00:12:05.82
I think they were called Ravens and they were sort of like a big

151
00:12:05.82 --> 00:12:10.22
Model airplane, you know little radio controlled airplane and

152
00:12:11.66 --> 00:12:18.42
Like single prop and you had to throw them into the air and then you had to be a legit pilot to be able to fly them

153
00:12:18.42 --> 00:12:22.74
You'd be flying them around in circles around the target the pilots all sucked so they're like crashing them

154
00:12:23.10 --> 00:12:27.14
What was one of laze one of laze AOI's no one of laze AOI sees

155
00:12:27.98 --> 00:12:34.38
He begged me we had something he goes hey, can I use our our UAV for this? Can I launch the UAV and I was like all right?

156
00:12:34.38 --> 00:12:36.38
So we were on

157
00:12:37.38 --> 00:12:44.14
NAB Coronado, I think and he throws this thing to launch it and it no kidding goes like 80 yards and

158
00:12:44.50 --> 00:12:47.22
plows into a building just head-on right

159
00:12:47.62 --> 00:12:50.50
Totally good, and then the second time he's used it

160
00:12:50.50 --> 00:12:56.06
We're out at our our urban training and he like launched it and again imagine a little tiny

161
00:12:56.86 --> 00:13:00.78
Model airplane. It's got a crappy camera like this is before you know

162
00:13:00.78 --> 00:13:05.66
This is like worse than a blackberry camera in 2005 right?

163
00:13:05.66 --> 00:13:09.06
This is just junk. It's not like now where you and I like we're all sitting at this table

164
00:13:09.06 --> 00:13:12.18
We all have like how many megapixels are on our iPhone?

165
00:13:13.26 --> 00:13:18.06
Did blackberry have a camera yeah, it did yeah, cuz I have like a

166
00:13:18.78 --> 00:13:22.98
Folder that says blackberry pictures. So yeah, it exists, right?

167
00:13:23.70 --> 00:13:28.34
And they are low quality so anyways you got this knucklehead you got this crappy camera

168
00:13:28.34 --> 00:13:30.62
You got this knucklehead seal like that's

169
00:13:31.34 --> 00:13:33.18
Like no pilot by any stretch

170
00:13:33.18 --> 00:13:37.18
He probably went to a three-week school or something and he's flying around a target and

171
00:13:37.70 --> 00:13:42.40
Try and the camera is not like we take for granted now you can just lock a camera in position

172
00:13:42.40 --> 00:13:46.94
It's it's got a little geo stabilizer and all that stuff. This didn't have any day. It's like

173
00:13:48.34 --> 00:13:53.66
Absolutely awful. It was literally worthless. So he's he's tell me like you know hey boss

174
00:13:53.66 --> 00:13:56.86
I got this thing. I will go with the UAV. We'll get a look at the target. All right, bro

175
00:13:56.86 --> 00:14:01.34
So he launches it you can't see anything. We're waiting to launch. I go. Hey man. Just bring it back here

176
00:14:01.34 --> 00:14:08.46
We got to go he brings it back and he tries to land and it crashes right over our home V's square into a tree, bro

177
00:14:09.58 --> 00:14:11.58
Just totally destroyed so

178
00:14:12.26 --> 00:14:19.22
They've made massive progress. I think I don't I mean I think your your crew is definitely out of a job in

179
00:14:19.90 --> 00:14:21.90
Next fighter for sure

180
00:14:22.14 --> 00:14:25.38
Who's thinking you still need to be in there? I think a lot of people

181
00:14:25.38 --> 00:14:28.98
What what is it what if you were to argue their side? What would you say?

182
00:14:28.98 --> 00:14:33.90
I think the argument of their side is like all the nuance that goes in with real-time decision-making and

183
00:14:34.86 --> 00:14:41.60
The flexibility that goes along with that requires a human being to understand sort of the nature of the the the three-dimensional

184
00:14:42.82 --> 00:14:48.38
Unpredictability in the fog of wars you need a human being to be able to make decisions as opposed to a computer

185
00:14:48.38 --> 00:14:51.34
I'm not an expert on AI, but it is startling

186
00:14:51.34 --> 00:14:56.26
It and it's not just what it can do. I think your point is a more important point is

187
00:14:56.62 --> 00:15:05.42
How how steep that curve is and if you think about like if you think about 30 years and how much happens in 30 years?

188
00:15:05.42 --> 00:15:06.66
That's why I'm looking at it like alright

189
00:15:06.66 --> 00:15:11.34
We're gonna start designing this thing now like we'll build we'll buy it and we'll build it and like we'll fly it and then

190
00:15:11.34 --> 00:15:13.34
Like 30 or 40 years from now. We're gonna do it again

191
00:15:13.82 --> 00:15:16.10
and I'm like 40 years from now like

192
00:15:16.10 --> 00:15:21.76
If I think about how old I'm gonna be and how much is gonna happen in that 40 years or 30 40 years

193
00:15:21.76 --> 00:15:25.86
I think it's really hard to not at least envision

194
00:15:26.90 --> 00:15:31.94
It's it's gonna be dramatic how much different the world is and just the concept of even what AI means

195
00:15:31.94 --> 00:15:36.90
It's not like it's going through something where it can like cook food for you or draw a piece of art

196
00:15:36.90 --> 00:15:42.50
It's like doing level eye level thing that is well beyond anything you can comprehend and just visualizing

197
00:15:42.50 --> 00:15:45.12
It'd be like saying the to the right brothers. So like hey

198
00:15:45.12 --> 00:15:51.72
What you just flew an airplane? That's amazing in 40 years. We're gonna walk on the moon. Maybe like that doesn't compute

199
00:15:51.72 --> 00:15:58.32
They can't make the connection of like 40 years later. It'll be like the 50s and we're gonna start putting people in outer space

200
00:15:59.16 --> 00:16:02.72
So I think if you think about that like what's gonna happen in 30 40 years

201
00:16:02.72 --> 00:16:05.80
I think that curve is so freaking steep that it's hard not to visualize

202
00:16:05.80 --> 00:16:11.52
It's gonna be something way beyond all we can imagine and the idea of like me Dave Burke you needing me to do that is

203
00:16:11.52 --> 00:16:16.000
It's a little arrogant. I guess basically you think of it like hey, man, you know

204
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.84
I I love to consider myself a smart guy, but give give the computers 35 years from now

205
00:16:20.84 --> 00:16:24.80
I think I think a lot is gonna change. There's a lot of things changing right now

206
00:16:24.80 --> 00:16:29.30
Yeah, there's a lot of things change right now the you know the battlefield in Ukraine right now

207
00:16:29.30 --> 00:16:33.68
The tanks are getting taken out at like a couple miles away

208
00:16:34.24 --> 00:16:37.70
With no, you know by a ground by a man-packed

209
00:16:37.70 --> 00:16:43.18
Munition that's a game changer that like all of a sudden in one

210
00:16:43.98 --> 00:16:47.86
Short period of time tanks are a little bit obsolete if you look at it from that perspective

211
00:16:48.58 --> 00:16:51.86
So things are changing. All right back to leadership here

212
00:16:51.86 --> 00:16:54.10
Of course with this particular group of service personnel

213
00:16:54.10 --> 00:16:57.50
I I am considering leadership as it applies to a military unit

214
00:16:57.50 --> 00:17:00.74
However, having been associated with industry for some time now

215
00:17:00.74 --> 00:17:05.70
I find it difficult to completely separate the principles of military and industrial leadership

216
00:17:05.70 --> 00:17:08.64
They have much in common so he agrees with us

217
00:17:09.42 --> 00:17:11.42
leadership is leadership in

218
00:17:12.10 --> 00:17:14.58
Selecting a company in which to invest our savings

219
00:17:14.58 --> 00:17:22.02
We often give primary consideration to the company with good leadership in a similar manner a military unit is often judged by its leadership

220
00:17:22.02 --> 00:17:29.18
Good leadership is essential to organized action where any group is involved the one who commands be he a military

221
00:17:29.74 --> 00:17:31.74
officer or captain of industry

222
00:17:31.74 --> 00:17:35.78
Must project power and energizing power which coordinates

223
00:17:36.18 --> 00:17:44.54
Coordinates and marshals the best efforts of his followers by supplying that certain something for which they look to him be a guidance

224
00:17:44.82 --> 00:17:49.64
support encouragement example or even new ideas and imagination

225
00:17:52.74 --> 00:17:54.74
So I

226
00:17:54.98 --> 00:17:56.42
Mean this is um

227
00:17:56.42 --> 00:18:03.50
This is what why the leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield, right? But it's so it's so interesting that this guy

228
00:18:05.54 --> 00:18:10.54
He's talking about these these like sucky this guy that spent his whole life in leadership

229
00:18:10.70 --> 00:18:12.78
Can't really put his finger on what he's talking about

230
00:18:12.78 --> 00:18:19.30
You know what I mean? He's like could be could be guidance could be support could be encouragement could be example could be new ideas

231
00:18:19.30 --> 00:18:21.58
That's a lots of wide range of stuff

232
00:18:21.58 --> 00:18:26.98
The test of a leader lies in the reaction and response of his followers now that's a good that's a good statement

233
00:18:26.98 --> 00:18:31.46
If your people aren't doing what you need him to do you're you're doing something wrong

234
00:18:34.14 --> 00:18:36.38
He should not have to impose authority

235
00:18:37.98 --> 00:18:40.74
Bossiness in itself never made a leader

236
00:18:42.54 --> 00:18:43.54
So there you go

237
00:18:43.54 --> 00:18:48.54
Which is also again for those of people that are up there with a stereotype that you're not doing anything wrong

238
00:18:48.54 --> 00:18:52.58
Which is also again for those of people that are up there with a stereotype of the military leader

239
00:18:52.58 --> 00:18:55.58
Here's this guy saying you should have to put impose your authority

240
00:18:56.90 --> 00:18:58.90
And you know we were at Gettysburg

241
00:18:59.62 --> 00:19:02.38
And I started talking about authority and like authority

242
00:19:03.02 --> 00:19:06.94
What the things people call on for authority rank?

243
00:19:08.02 --> 00:19:10.02
time in experience

244
00:19:12.22 --> 00:19:17.38
Knowledge technical knowledge like all those things people can call on that and use it as authority

245
00:19:17.38 --> 00:19:21.22
Like I've been doing this. Hey, I've been podcasting for three years, man

246
00:19:21.22 --> 00:19:25.38
You don't know what you're talking like that kind of thing. That's just a that's just an argument of authority

247
00:19:26.30 --> 00:19:28.30
So it goes beyond just rank

248
00:19:30.46 --> 00:19:38.26
Continue on he must make his influence felt by example and the instilling of confidence in his followers the greatness of a leader is

249
00:19:38.26 --> 00:19:40.26
measured by the achievements of the lead

250
00:19:40.26 --> 00:19:46.82
This is the ultimate test of his effectiveness

251
00:19:47.34 --> 00:19:49.34
Chuck I'm on board of that

252
00:19:49.34 --> 00:19:54.26
Yeah, and and listen, I'll make this comment now so I'm gonna have to come back to it like that comments

253
00:19:54.26 --> 00:19:56.26
I would say a timeless comment

254
00:19:56.30 --> 00:19:59.78
Your achievement as a leader is based on what your people accomplish

255
00:19:59.78 --> 00:20:05.66
If you've listened to what I said five minutes ago and like oh, I'm just gonna outsource my leadership to a computer down the road

256
00:20:05.66 --> 00:20:10.10
That's not a good plan the attributes that the the behaviors of good leadership

257
00:20:10.34 --> 00:20:12.34
Regardless of what computers might be able to do in the future

258
00:20:12.78 --> 00:20:16.74
The most important thing you could ever possibly do is make you and the people around you better leaders

259
00:20:16.98 --> 00:20:20.30
So don't get all wrapped up on this AI is gonna solve your problems

260
00:20:20.30 --> 00:20:26.02
I don't know when it will if it ever will but between now and then learning how to be a good leader is a really good use of your time

261
00:20:26.98 --> 00:20:28.98
Well, it's the most important thing

262
00:20:29.14 --> 00:20:33.78
Nothing nothing that you can do as an individual human can ever compete with what you can do with a team

263
00:20:33.78 --> 00:20:35.78
That's it. Yeah

264
00:20:37.22 --> 00:20:40.26
Too frequently we use the words leader and commander

265
00:20:40.62 --> 00:20:41.46
synonymously

266
00:20:41.46 --> 00:20:48.70
We should not forget that there are far more staff officer assignments than there are command billets and a good staff officer

267
00:20:49.06 --> 00:20:56.10
Can and should display the same leadership as a commander while it takes a good staff officer to initiate an effective plan

268
00:20:56.10 --> 00:21:01.14
It requires a leader to ensure that the plan is properly executed

269
00:21:01.14 --> 00:21:05.66
That is why you and I have been taught that the work of collecting information

270
00:21:06.34 --> 00:21:14.46
Studying it drawing a plan making a decision is 10% of the job and seeing that the plan seeing the plan through is the other

271
00:21:14.98 --> 00:21:21.70
90% a well-trained officer is one who could serve effectively either as a staff officer or as a commander

272
00:21:22.90 --> 00:21:28.02
You know, this is the the conversation that you and I have we've had it at the muster a few times because

273
00:21:28.02 --> 00:21:33.30
When and I wrote about it in extreme ownership

274
00:21:34.26 --> 00:21:36.26
with Seth stone and

275
00:21:36.26 --> 00:21:38.26
writing on his

276
00:21:38.26 --> 00:21:40.26
Writing on his Humvee window

277
00:21:41.42 --> 00:21:46.90
Relax, here's what you do when you start getting shot at bro one relax to look around three make a call

278
00:21:46.90 --> 00:21:49.46
And then you and I had a conversation about about it

279
00:21:49.46 --> 00:21:53.66
And you were lining it up with the oodaloop and the last thing in the in the oodaloop is

280
00:21:53.66 --> 00:21:58.98
Act after you decide you act and they didn't quite line up because I didn't

281
00:21:59.38 --> 00:22:04.38
Say execute or act when I put that thing on Seth stones board on his window

282
00:22:04.38 --> 00:22:08.82
And the reason I didn't have to say that is because his platoon was like ready to do whatever the hell he said to do

283
00:22:08.82 --> 00:22:12.66
Right, they weren't having a problem with execution. He was just having a problem with decide

284
00:22:13.14 --> 00:22:18.26
You were only solving the parts that he wasn't doing so you need to add a component that was already happening with that guy

285
00:22:18.26 --> 00:22:20.50
Yeah, and that's what this is

286
00:22:20.50 --> 00:22:27.06
It's getting people to actually do things. That's what he's saying is 90% of the job

287
00:22:27.58 --> 00:22:29.58
sitting there and coming up with a plan is

288
00:22:30.62 --> 00:22:35.70
Okay, I mean it's you know, there's there's some small challenges to come up with a plan, but not really I mean

289
00:22:36.22 --> 00:22:41.34
If you have time to plan then you have time to assess different angles and look at things and come up and try different little courses of

290
00:22:41.34 --> 00:22:45.70
Actions and run through some war games some some possibilities and then you got a plan you're good

291
00:22:45.70 --> 00:22:52.86
But getting people to actually execute that thing that's what's a challenge. That's where things fall apart by the way

292
00:22:53.94 --> 00:22:55.94
That's where dreams die

293
00:22:56.78 --> 00:22:58.78
I'm gonna tell you that right now

294
00:22:58.82 --> 00:23:00.82
dreams die in

295
00:23:01.42 --> 00:23:07.30
Execution they don't the dream comes out man. The dream flourishes in someone's mind, right?

296
00:23:07.58 --> 00:23:11.94
People go people live out the entire fantasy. They've the entire dream

297
00:23:11.94 --> 00:23:17.62
People live out like echo comes out up with an idea for a movie, right?

298
00:23:18.02 --> 00:23:23.86
He lives out the whole fantasy the Oscar awards like the whole thing the limo's like the red carpet

299
00:23:23.86 --> 00:23:25.42
He's got that whole thing

300
00:23:25.42 --> 00:23:29.62
But guess what he fails on execution, right? Like it's like oh, but now I got to work

301
00:23:30.30 --> 00:23:32.50
But now I got to take and I got to do this thing

302
00:23:33.38 --> 00:23:36.34
So dreams die in that in that space

303
00:23:36.34 --> 00:23:43.78
Between decide and act that's where dreams die between idea and execution. That's where dreams die and that's why a

304
00:23:44.42 --> 00:23:49.98
Leader's a leader's job is to make that execution happen and here's the thing

305
00:23:50.06 --> 00:23:54.94
There's another thing said Cess don't we got interviewed about the battle of Ramadi and and

306
00:23:55.38 --> 00:23:58.30
Seth told the interviewer that I had to like beat

307
00:23:58.30 --> 00:24:03.54
I had to beat my head against the wall for every operation that we were able to do which was an exaggeration

308
00:24:03.54 --> 00:24:10.10
But the fact the matter is and I would tell that story to the young officers like if you think you're gonna do a mission without

309
00:24:10.62 --> 00:24:17.14
Like making that mission happen. You're not going to be able to you know, it's almost it's very rare that you're gonna be able to

310
00:24:18.34 --> 00:24:21.18
That that an operation you come up with a plan and it and like okay

311
00:24:21.18 --> 00:24:25.66
I said it in motion and now it's just gonna happen. No, you have to like fight every step of the way and that's the way it is in business

312
00:24:25.66 --> 00:24:27.66
That's the way it is in life

313
00:24:27.66 --> 00:24:36.46
Yeah, I I'm picturing trying to convince other people that that you need to be on board with when you've come up with a plan

314
00:24:37.78 --> 00:24:43.66
Knowing that they're gonna have to be on board with that plan and when when he says you're gonna beat your head against the wall

315
00:24:43.66 --> 00:24:47.06
I think like you said your point is just the amount of sheer work that it takes

316
00:24:47.06 --> 00:24:49.98
You don't just like hey you guys and they're like cool and it just happens

317
00:24:50.34 --> 00:24:56.38
It's all the other people and all the things they have to do and where leadership comes in on that just to convince people

318
00:24:56.38 --> 00:25:00.18
And I hate to say it there are times that are people out there that just want to say no

319
00:25:00.18 --> 00:25:02.82
they just want to say no to your plan and

320
00:25:04.02 --> 00:25:09.54
You especially if there's rank involved you can't just tell those people what did you get a lead your way around those things and there's so much

321
00:25:09.54 --> 00:25:11.54
harder than sometimes people give credit for and

322
00:25:12.14 --> 00:25:20.74
How often I'll see people run into a barrier and then stop and and give up that until I literally wrote down dreams that execution

323
00:25:20.74 --> 00:25:22.74
I mean, it's kind of funny when you say it

324
00:25:22.74 --> 00:25:27.86
But that's the hardest part not the I could sit at my desk and I would do this all the time in Ramadi had these ideas like hey

325
00:25:27.86 --> 00:25:30.18
We're gonna do this. We're gonna go here. We're gonna make all these things happen

326
00:25:31.18 --> 00:25:36.86
And then reality is in there and the hardest part about there that is the people you have to get on board to making this stuff happen

327
00:25:36.86 --> 00:25:38.66
Not your people going ready to go execute

328
00:25:38.66 --> 00:25:42.90
But all the things that get in the way of to the point where you can go execute that plan

329
00:25:42.90 --> 00:25:48.90
Yeah, you ever heard the term idea guy and I he's not you guys, you know, which is a bummer

330
00:25:48.90 --> 00:25:53.42
It's it's what and this is this is a huge dichotomy is that

331
00:25:55.06 --> 00:25:58.90
For me like okay, let's say I'm right a book. Let's say I'm right way of the warrior kid

332
00:25:59.90 --> 00:26:08.62
The idea is the is by far the hardest part of that. It is so hard to come up with an idea like that's viable and good

333
00:26:09.90 --> 00:26:14.54
It well I can't even say it's hard work. It's almost like it's almost like life

334
00:26:15.54 --> 00:26:17.54
It's almost like a life

335
00:26:17.54 --> 00:26:22.86
It's almost like life like you can't you can't create life like hey a

336
00:26:23.42 --> 00:26:26.30
Scientist knows the various ingredients that are in a cell

337
00:26:26.70 --> 00:26:34.42
But they can't make it they can't mix them together make it come to life, right as tenacious D said you can't manufacture in

338
00:26:34.42 --> 00:26:40.66
Spirado so so it's it's this dichotomy because the hardest thing you could do like write a hit song

339
00:26:41.14 --> 00:26:45.18
Right. Oh my gosh, like everybody knows what chords it is

340
00:26:45.18 --> 00:26:49.90
Like there's four chords five chords that you're gonna be using whatever and yet

341
00:26:50.38 --> 00:26:54.02
Jack White is writing hit song after hit song after hit song coming out

342
00:26:54.26 --> 00:26:57.66
He's he's bringing them out of thin air, right?

343
00:26:57.66 --> 00:27:02.90
And yet someone else is spending their entire life trying and they can't make it happen

344
00:27:03.38 --> 00:27:08.34
So it's weird that you can have because I kind of wrote down a note. I was like ideas have no value

345
00:27:09.46 --> 00:27:12.14
Because ideas by themselves have no value they have no value

346
00:27:12.14 --> 00:27:17.50
And you have a riff in your head or you got an idea for some new component or whatever

347
00:27:17.90 --> 00:27:23.34
If it's just an idea man, it has no value and that's proven out in the fact that if you go and find investors for your idea

348
00:27:23.50 --> 00:27:25.86
They're gonna buy your idea for pennies on the dollar

349
00:27:25.86 --> 00:27:31.34
You're gonna own like a little tiny piece of it if you're lucky if you are if now if you are able to hang on to the idea

350
00:27:31.34 --> 00:27:34.86
And you're able to execute you could end up being you know

351
00:27:34.86 --> 00:27:42.58
Peter teal or Elon Musk that came up with the idea of PayPal and held on to it for long enough that okay here we go

352
00:27:44.02 --> 00:27:45.78
so

353
00:27:45.78 --> 00:27:50.06
Have you got anything got it you think it's like it's like a it's a war man

354
00:27:50.06 --> 00:27:57.06
It's a war the whole thing from the idea that you come up with that's great to the executioner and by the way if you're an idea guy

355
00:27:57.86 --> 00:27:58.82
and

356
00:27:58.82 --> 00:28:00.62
Your stubborn

357
00:28:00.62 --> 00:28:06.42
The don't be so I'm gonna I'm gonna give you some advice don't be stubborn find somebody that's an execution guy and be like

358
00:28:06.42 --> 00:28:07.50
Hey, dude, I got a really good idea

359
00:28:07.50 --> 00:28:11.54
Do you want to help me execute this thing and there's all kinds of different people out there and

360
00:28:12.18 --> 00:28:18.10
Some people idea people and some people are execution people and you got to work with these other people to get things to move very few people

361
00:28:18.58 --> 00:28:20.58
Are gonna come up with an idea

362
00:28:21.98 --> 00:28:26.66
Execute the idea properly with the right logistics to make this thing work. That's why you build a team

363
00:28:26.66 --> 00:28:31.18
So I was a radio man in the day was back in the day

364
00:28:31.18 --> 00:28:32.14
So I was a radio man

365
00:28:32.14 --> 00:28:36.78
So which man I was always on the field and I had a little flashlight with me right a little red lens flashlight

366
00:28:36.78 --> 00:28:37.58
And I would tape it up

367
00:28:37.58 --> 00:28:42.06
So it'd be really really dim because a little bit of light goes a long way and you just need to look at your your

368
00:28:42.50 --> 00:28:45.66
Radio in the dark and you got a turn on your little flashlight

369
00:28:45.74 --> 00:28:48.42
but you know you have a batteries and

370
00:28:49.06 --> 00:28:53.74
They wear out and you know where it gets left to like all those all kinds of problems and it's big

371
00:28:53.74 --> 00:28:57.14
And I remember one day I was in a helicopter

372
00:28:58.18 --> 00:29:03.26
And I'm looking at the pilot and the pilot's reading his map and he's got a lip light, you know, this is day

373
00:29:03.26 --> 00:29:09.38
I'm sure you do. Yeah, right. It's like so where they where they're headset, you know where the radio comes out

374
00:29:09.70 --> 00:29:11.78
There was a little cool. How did you turn it on?

375
00:29:11.78 --> 00:29:15.10
I think like either like your tongue or something like whatever the

376
00:29:15.70 --> 00:29:17.98
magnet electro or I'm Donald Blight but like

377
00:29:17.98 --> 00:29:24.90
You're your contact with it illuminated the light and what if you bite down on her or to close your eyes or something

378
00:29:25.46 --> 00:29:30.54
So but all it was was an LED a little dim LED light that you could see and

379
00:29:31.58 --> 00:29:34.98
It's like LED like every light in my house right now is an LED light

380
00:29:35.30 --> 00:29:42.22
But I but I didn't think oh I should make a flashlight a little tiny tiny flashlights like that because you had

381
00:29:42.22 --> 00:29:47.22
You wouldn't have looked at remember when you were kidding you had some kind of a toy that was lit up with an LED light

382
00:29:47.62 --> 00:29:50.86
It's like any random toy. They had little LED lights

383
00:29:50.86 --> 00:29:56.46
Those are bright enough to be a flashlight and I was a radio man and I didn't put two and two together and

384
00:29:57.54 --> 00:30:03.74
By the time when Iraq the Iraq war started someone else came out with little LED flashlights and now that's all they're gonna use

385
00:30:03.74 --> 00:30:06.06
This period so there's a classic example

386
00:30:06.06 --> 00:30:11.46
I'm I didn't that idea is worth probably hundreds and hundreds of millions probably worth billions of dollars now of

387
00:30:11.46 --> 00:30:13.26
LED flashlights

388
00:30:13.26 --> 00:30:15.90
It was right in front of you is dancing around. I didn't see it

389
00:30:15.90 --> 00:30:22.26
So that that idea would have had it unlimited value to me if I could have executed, but I couldn't I didn't know it

390
00:30:22.26 --> 00:30:24.76
I just didn't know it so

391
00:30:25.62 --> 00:30:31.46
That's why the idea has limitless value, but at the same time if you don't execute some no value at all

392
00:30:31.98 --> 00:30:37.30
That's the kind of the same as Bluetooth remember cuz when Bluetooth came out, right? It was like

393
00:30:37.30 --> 00:30:42.54
Just the earpiece. It's like that's Bluetooth now like everything is good to the truth

394
00:30:42.54 --> 00:30:48.10
It's like no wire. There's no wire anymore necessary and Bluetooth owns like Bluetooth

395
00:30:48.10 --> 00:30:50.82
They own that stuff so they're getting yeah, yeah

396
00:30:50.82 --> 00:30:57.42
Imagine getting paid on every set of head of Bluetooth headphones now and every to speaker and boot. Yeah

397
00:30:57.86 --> 00:30:59.86
So there's a good one

398
00:31:00.46 --> 00:31:02.46
Little technology activity. All right

399
00:31:02.46 --> 00:31:07.42
I'm back to the book here. I can recall a former vice president of one of the companies with which I'm associated

400
00:31:07.42 --> 00:31:12.28
He would formulate some good plans, but never followed up to see it as plans got expected results. I

401
00:31:12.98 --> 00:31:16.34
Knew he had served in World War two so out of curiosity

402
00:31:16.34 --> 00:31:21.18
I looked into the nature of the service and found that his entire period of service was a staff officer

403
00:31:21.46 --> 00:31:26.42
He had never had the advantage of a command job. So his training was incomplete

404
00:31:26.58 --> 00:31:29.46
Maybe if he'd remained in the service longer, we could have deployed

405
00:31:29.46 --> 00:31:36.66
He'd developed his leadership qualities as well and this man would still be with the company that you got fired

406
00:31:37.46 --> 00:31:39.46
So there you go

407
00:31:39.50 --> 00:31:45.44
Couldn't execute good coming up with plans just couldn't get him executed. You may have heard the story about general perzing World War one

408
00:31:46.34 --> 00:31:50.18
While inspecting a certain area he found a project that was not going too well

409
00:31:50.42 --> 00:31:53.58
Even though the second lieutenant in charge seemed to have a pretty good plan

410
00:31:53.58 --> 00:31:59.98
General perzing asked the lieutenant how much pay he received and when the lieutenant replied a hundred and forty one dollars and sixty seven per

411
00:31:59.98 --> 00:32:07.22
Months or general perzing said just remember that you get paid a dollar sixty seven for making your plan and issuing the order and a hundred and forty

412
00:32:07.22 --> 00:32:09.22
Dollars for seeing that gets carried out. I

413
00:32:10.90 --> 00:32:15.70
Think I heard that story about Paton too. I guess maybe Paton heard it from from purging I

414
00:32:17.58 --> 00:32:20.06
Am not sure that I would go to that extreme

415
00:32:20.06 --> 00:32:25.54
Certainly in these days problems are complex and good staff work plays a large part in resolving them

416
00:32:25.54 --> 00:32:28.58
I have known commanders who were not too smart

417
00:32:28.58 --> 00:32:33.58
But they were very knowledgeable about personnel and new enough to select the very best for their staffs

418
00:32:34.02 --> 00:32:40.30
Remember a good leader is one who causes or inspires others a staff or subordinate commanders to do the job

419
00:32:40.30 --> 00:32:42.78
Isn't that interesting word causes?

420
00:32:43.86 --> 00:32:46.82
Or inspires like it's just happening

421
00:32:46.82 --> 00:32:50.90
Furthermore no leader knows it all

422
00:32:51.50 --> 00:32:56.70
Although so you sometimes may find one who seems to think he does and that's coming from that's from the document

423
00:32:57.10 --> 00:32:59.90
Even he had a deal with people that thought they knew everything

424
00:33:01.10 --> 00:33:06.14
A leader should encourage the members of his staff to speak up if they think the commander is wrong

425
00:33:07.14 --> 00:33:11.34
He should give he should invite constructive considered criticism

426
00:33:11.34 --> 00:33:16.74
It is a grave error for the leader to surround himself with a yes staff. Oh

427
00:33:17.66 --> 00:33:22.46
See he developed this idea and I executed in the book leadership strategy and tactics don't be you know

428
00:33:22.46 --> 00:33:25.46
No, no yes, man, right? He's knowing this

429
00:33:27.90 --> 00:33:34.34
General George C. Marshall was an excellent excellent exponent of the principle of having subordinates speak up

430
00:33:35.02 --> 00:33:37.98
when he first became chief of staff of the army

431
00:33:37.98 --> 00:33:45.42
The secretariat of that office consisted of three officers who presented orally to General Marshall the staff papers or studies

432
00:33:45.82 --> 00:33:49.34
Coming from the divisions of the general staff. I was a member of the secretariat

433
00:33:49.86 --> 00:33:56.38
We presented in abbreviated form the contents of the staff studies citing the highlights of the problem involved the various possibilities course

434
00:33:56.38 --> 00:34:02.82
various possible courses of action considered and the action recommended at the end of his first week as chief of staff

435
00:34:02.82 --> 00:34:05.38
Marshall called us into his army

436
00:34:05.38 --> 00:34:11.30
Staff Marshall called us into his office and opened the discussion by saying I am disappointed in all of you

437
00:34:12.94 --> 00:34:19.86
When we inquired if we might ask why he said you haven't disagreed with a single thing I have done all week

438
00:34:20.86 --> 00:34:26.64
We told him it so happened that we were in full agreement with every paper that had been presented that we knew what he wanted

439
00:34:26.64 --> 00:34:30.82
And that we would add our comments to anything that we considered should be questioned

440
00:34:30.82 --> 00:34:38.34
The very next day we presented a paper as written and then expressed some thoughts which in our opinion

441
00:34:38.82 --> 00:34:40.82
Made the recommended action

442
00:34:41.38 --> 00:34:42.34
questionable

443
00:34:42.34 --> 00:34:48.72
General Marshall said now that is what I want unless I hear all the arguments against an action

444
00:34:48.72 --> 00:34:51.58
I am not sure whether I am right or not

445
00:34:54.46 --> 00:34:57.18
I was at FTX with us along front

446
00:34:57.18 --> 00:35:00.78
And I said something along the lines of and I actually wrote it down

447
00:35:01.02 --> 00:35:05.78
But it's something along the lines of if you don't get any pushback

448
00:35:06.90 --> 00:35:08.90
It's it's a warning

449
00:35:09.34 --> 00:35:14.26
So and that's his leader and it could be a warning for a bunch of different. It's a symptom for a bunch of different problems

450
00:35:14.66 --> 00:35:21.44
Like the primary one. Hey, maybe everyone's scared of to tell you what they actually think of your stupid plan

451
00:35:21.44 --> 00:35:27.84
Maybe you're hoarding information so they can't even assess whether a plan is accurate or not

452
00:35:28.08 --> 00:35:35.16
Maybe you've got them trained to a point where all they want to do is agree with you if you train your leaders

453
00:35:35.28 --> 00:35:40.74
Like you can do such a exquisite job training your leaders that you've replicated yourself

454
00:35:41.24 --> 00:35:44.20
And you don't want to replicate yourself

455
00:35:45.16 --> 00:35:48.88
You want to have people that have different perspectives. That's the goal

456
00:35:48.88 --> 00:35:50.88
Yeah, I wrote down

457
00:35:50.88 --> 00:35:55.46
You're going kind of going through that list of all the potential reasons why I know there's more but I wrote down

458
00:35:55.46 --> 00:35:59.76
We all see it the same way and how easy is to fall in the trap for like that's a good thing

459
00:35:59.76 --> 00:36:00.88
That's not a good thing

460
00:36:00.88 --> 00:36:06.88
We I don't want people and the whole point of the risk behind that is is we can have a great relationship

461
00:36:06.88 --> 00:36:12.96
You see the way I operate we get aligned we get fundamentally observing in the world the same way and that seems like such a good thing

462
00:36:12.96 --> 00:36:19.92
But it's not I actually want you to see it from a perspective from a perspective that I don't see him like hey dude

463
00:36:19.92 --> 00:36:21.56
You don't see what I'm seeing over here

464
00:36:21.56 --> 00:36:28.28
So when we talk about being aligned we want alignment on what our outcomes want to be and what the objective is

465
00:36:28.32 --> 00:36:31.68
But I don't want everybody seeing the problem the same way that I see the problem

466
00:36:33.36 --> 00:36:36.02
And you know even

467
00:36:36.02 --> 00:36:43.14
Checking out what we want our outcomes to be I've worked with clients before where I'm like well

468
00:36:43.82 --> 00:36:45.82
Why do you want to do that?

469
00:36:45.82 --> 00:36:47.06
I

470
00:36:47.06 --> 00:36:51.82
Remember was working with a client that was like what we want to grow by X percentage. I was like well, why do you want to do that?

471
00:36:52.74 --> 00:36:56.66
What's the reason well because because we want to grow okay?

472
00:36:56.90 --> 00:37:01.02
So what is it going to take to grow and you start like why do you want to do that?

473
00:37:01.02 --> 00:37:07.14
It's some some businesses they get into a good spot and look we are programmed now in the business world right?

474
00:37:07.54 --> 00:37:09.54
Program to hey growth

475
00:37:10.22 --> 00:37:12.22
growth is success and

476
00:37:12.86 --> 00:37:19.02
There's a lot of reality to that right there's a lot of reality to growth is success depending on the type of business

477
00:37:19.02 --> 00:37:21.38
but like you you get a small family business and

478
00:37:21.38 --> 00:37:30.62
And well they got you know husband and wife they got a good business going and they have a

479
00:37:31.30 --> 00:37:33.30
kid and

480
00:37:33.34 --> 00:37:35.34
They want to grow the business well

481
00:37:35.70 --> 00:37:39.78
You know what was that kid want to do? Does that kid want to take over the family business?

482
00:37:40.18 --> 00:37:44.02
Is do they want to keep this business at a sustainable rate where they can kind of?

483
00:37:44.98 --> 00:37:50.34
Continue on with their business and don't have to look you're getting oh you oh you go to uh?

484
00:37:50.34 --> 00:37:53.66
You go to Florida every every winter for three weeks

485
00:37:54.26 --> 00:37:58.46
When you're if you grow your business all of a sudden that Florida trip three weeks you can't do that anymore

486
00:37:58.58 --> 00:38:00.58
So you listen what are you trying to do?

487
00:38:01.22 --> 00:38:06.14
So even like where's our outcome you need to even question that and this is a great example

488
00:38:06.14 --> 00:38:08.98
You know we've gone through in the well with Vietnam

489
00:38:09.90 --> 00:38:11.22
with

490
00:38:11.22 --> 00:38:13.42
Iraq and Afghanistan, you know

491
00:38:14.10 --> 00:38:15.94
To what end?

492
00:38:15.94 --> 00:38:22.06
And I know Jamie just did on the woman's assemble. She taught she talked about to what end which is a book by Ward Justin and

493
00:38:23.70 --> 00:38:28.74
She took what I had talked about at the council at the council. I kind of opened up talking about

494
00:38:29.58 --> 00:38:35.34
To what end and this is what Ward just was all asking about the Vietnam War here

495
00:38:35.34 --> 00:38:39.66
We are we're spending billions of dollars. We're losing American lives

496
00:38:41.06 --> 00:38:44.22
We're killing a bunch of Vietnamese people

497
00:38:44.22 --> 00:38:50.78
To what end what are we trying to do here? And if you have that attitude in

498
00:38:52.38 --> 00:38:58.42
Every decision that you make, you know when echo wakes up in the morning goes down, you know to the donut shop

499
00:38:58.94 --> 00:39:04.94
In orders of donut like to what end are you doing this if you ask yourself that honestly to what end well?

500
00:39:04.94 --> 00:39:10.98
I know it's gonna taste good. Okay, but like where are you gonna be in a few years? Well, you know what actually I'm doing this right now

501
00:39:10.98 --> 00:39:15.58
I get it. I'm just gonna have this donut, but you know, I'm gonna do a hard workout later

502
00:39:15.58 --> 00:39:19.98
And I'm not gonna eat anything else sweet for the next, you know, couple days. Okay, so you have a plan

503
00:39:20.62 --> 00:39:24.74
But where people lose it is when they're not actually thinking about where they're trying to go

504
00:39:26.78 --> 00:39:31.54
That's a problem so ask yourself that question to what end and

505
00:39:32.22 --> 00:39:34.58
If your boss is telling you to do something

506
00:39:35.82 --> 00:39:39.48
Or your boss has come up with a plan or you're presenting a boss a plan to your boss

507
00:39:39.48 --> 00:39:43.64
And your boss doesn't agree with you. You might be you might not be aligned on where you're trying to go

508
00:39:43.86 --> 00:39:45.46
Well, wait a second

509
00:39:45.46 --> 00:39:48.74
Are we trying to grow the business? Okay. Well, what part of the business are we trying to grow?

510
00:39:48.74 --> 00:39:50.74
There's all kinds of questions to be asked here

511
00:39:51.46 --> 00:39:53.46
So pay attention to those things

512
00:39:57.42 --> 00:40:03.58
If you happen to be a detail if you happen to be detailed to a staff try to be a good staff officer

513
00:40:03.58 --> 00:40:05.42
And if possible avoid being a yes, man

514
00:40:05.42 --> 00:40:09.90
I would suggest to all commanders that they inform the members of their staffs that anyone who does not

515
00:40:10.34 --> 00:40:17.14
Disagree once in a while with what is about to be done is is of limited value and perhaps should be shifted to some other place

516
00:40:17.14 --> 00:40:19.14
Where he might occasionally have an idea

517
00:40:19.34 --> 00:40:23.86
So you got someone that never disagrees with you get rid of them. They're they're not helping you

518
00:40:27.46 --> 00:40:30.50
Of course, I am thinking about the decision-making process

519
00:40:30.50 --> 00:40:34.66
After decision is made everyone must be behind it a hundred percent

520
00:40:34.66 --> 00:40:40.90
I thought the British were admirable in this respect during World War two no matter how much discussion

521
00:40:40.90 --> 00:40:45.26
There had been on a subject as soon as a decision was made you never heard any doubts expressed

522
00:40:45.38 --> 00:40:50.86
You had to believe that everyone involved in making the decision had never entertained any ideas

523
00:40:51.38 --> 00:40:53.38
Except those expressed in the decision

524
00:40:55.46 --> 00:40:59.10
We could talk for a long long long time about this

525
00:40:59.10 --> 00:41:03.78
And the reason we could talk for a long long time about this is

526
00:41:04.90 --> 00:41:10.50
Because there's an element that comes into play when Dave and I are an echo or discussing how we're gonna execute something

527
00:41:10.50 --> 00:41:13.54
And that's that thing that comes into play is Dave's ego

528
00:41:13.98 --> 00:41:17.82
Echoes ego and my ego and once those things are in play

529
00:41:18.34 --> 00:41:20.34
all of a sudden

530
00:41:20.34 --> 00:41:27.90
It's very difficult for us to walk out of the room feeling like I support Dave's plan a hundred percent

531
00:41:27.90 --> 00:41:31.94
It's very very difficult because damn I'm just a little bit more

532
00:41:32.50 --> 00:41:39.38
Practically savvy than Davis and he's imposing this plan on me and he's not listening to what I'm saying and I'm gonna be pissed

533
00:41:40.50 --> 00:41:41.90
and

534
00:41:41.90 --> 00:41:47.34
By the way, I'm pissed echoes even more pissed because his plan was even more desperate than mine

535
00:41:47.54 --> 00:41:51.74
was from Dave's plans and his ego is even bigger so now we now he's

536
00:41:52.58 --> 00:41:56.14
Totally against what we're doing, but you've barked the order so we're gonna go do it

537
00:41:56.14 --> 00:42:01.46
We're gonna do it pissed and we're not gonna be successful. Will you put ego into this equation? This is what causes this problem

538
00:42:02.86 --> 00:42:04.86
Yeah, and that ego

539
00:42:06.42 --> 00:42:08.58
That ego when it comes out

540
00:42:09.18 --> 00:42:14.70
Will reveal itself when I now have to do your plan and it doesn't quite go the way that you were thinking and I kind of know

541
00:42:14.70 --> 00:42:18.42
That's gonna happen that my ego is almost gonna be happy to see that failure

542
00:42:18.42 --> 00:42:22.70
I'm gonna take some and I might I might be keeping my ego mostly in the control

543
00:42:22.82 --> 00:42:25.66
But there's a little part of me if I don't really have that thing in check

544
00:42:25.66 --> 00:42:27.66
a little part of me that's

545
00:42:27.66 --> 00:42:31.74
Once this little hiccup this little error this little failure this little setback

546
00:42:31.74 --> 00:42:33.74
I almost want it to happen and

547
00:42:34.38 --> 00:42:39.62
When I get to the point of how I'm actually supposed to work through that and solve that problem and my ego is really

548
00:42:39.94 --> 00:42:44.46
Barking at hate you knew this was coming you knew tacos plan was stupid and you knew this is gonna happen

549
00:42:44.90 --> 00:42:47.22
It's almost like I want that failure to occur

550
00:42:47.82 --> 00:42:49.82
So I can see do you go

551
00:42:49.94 --> 00:42:51.94
Told you man as opposed to

552
00:42:51.94 --> 00:42:58.98
Solving that which I probably can but how powerful the ego is and I think you've said it like I'd rather

553
00:43:00.14 --> 00:43:07.50
Be right then win. Oh, yeah, there's been countless people and and you know a good the the ultimate example

554
00:43:07.50 --> 00:43:10.50
That is there's people that would rather die themselves

555
00:43:11.06 --> 00:43:13.06
and get their men killed

556
00:43:14.26 --> 00:43:18.78
Then subordinate their ego to someone else or admit that they were wrong about something like that

557
00:43:18.78 --> 00:43:23.18
And then there's there's examples throughout history disgusting examples like that

558
00:43:23.82 --> 00:43:25.22
now

559
00:43:25.22 --> 00:43:27.74
Here's a I'm gonna give everyone

560
00:43:28.90 --> 00:43:31.70
Just a beautiful beautiful piece of advice right now

561
00:43:32.50 --> 00:43:35.98
And you know, I don't say this very often. This is a beautiful piece of advice to for everyone

562
00:43:36.78 --> 00:43:42.90
Here's my default mode when I walk into the planning room with Dave and echo

563
00:43:42.90 --> 00:43:49.42
My default mode is going with Dave's plan or I'm going with echoes man. My default mode is to support someone else's plan

564
00:43:49.42 --> 00:43:50.46
That's my default mode

565
00:43:50.46 --> 00:43:54.90
My default mode is not to impose my plan on everybody else never and by the way

566
00:43:54.90 --> 00:43:59.90
It doesn't matter if I'm the boss walking in to talk to you guys or if I'm the subordinate walking in to talk

567
00:43:59.98 --> 00:44:05.66
It doesn't matter my default mode is I'm gonna go with someone else's plan. I'm gonna go with what you recommend

568
00:44:06.54 --> 00:44:11.90
The only and look if you come up with the most wazoo plan ever created BTF Tony

569
00:44:11.90 --> 00:44:14.98
BTF Tony who I love

570
00:44:15.50 --> 00:44:23.14
Who's the freaking tactical is he's as tactically sound as any human has ever been and like he came up with

571
00:44:24.50 --> 00:44:32.10
In Ramadi, he's like I want to take the freaking like he wanted it. It was something that was like legitimately insane

572
00:44:32.78 --> 00:44:38.42
He wanted to take the little side be like a little side-by-side with himself just by himself and do like a patrol out

573
00:44:38.42 --> 00:44:43.26
It's just some random part of Ramadi and set up in a building or something because he thought he could get away with it

574
00:44:43.26 --> 00:44:45.10
Just going by himself

575
00:44:45.10 --> 00:44:47.10
I was like Tony, bro

576
00:44:48.42 --> 00:44:49.70
You can't do that dude

577
00:44:49.70 --> 00:44:54.82
You can't you can't just go by yourself and you know what? Hey, there's actually a 90% chance that it would have worked

578
00:44:54.82 --> 00:44:58.74
It's also a 10% chance. We never saw Tony again, which I was put the risk out, right?

579
00:44:59.10 --> 00:45:03.50
So Tony, I'm sorry, but like unless someone just comes up

580
00:45:03.50 --> 00:45:08.46
But other than that one time Tony and I in the time that we work together

581
00:45:08.98 --> 00:45:13.18
We were never in disagreement about a plan more than like

582
00:45:14.18 --> 00:45:17.70
0.01% huh, you know like oh hit it from here up sounds good

583
00:45:17.70 --> 00:45:26.34
And you know what basically eventually as I worked with Leif and Seth it all became that now what I had to be careful of is

584
00:45:27.82 --> 00:45:30.34
What you already gave warning of like I didn't want

585
00:45:30.34 --> 00:45:34.74
To say like oh life came up with a plan. That's great. I don't question

586
00:45:34.74 --> 00:45:39.06
I would always pull myself back far enough to go. Okay, just make sure life. I'd make look at stoner's plan

587
00:45:39.06 --> 00:45:42.66
I'll just make sure yep. Hey, is there anything I can I poke any holes in this I?

588
00:45:43.82 --> 00:45:50.38
Hate saying devil's advocate, but you have to be a little bit of a devil's advocate to make sure that you're you're trying to poke holes

589
00:45:50.38 --> 00:45:54.30
In plans to see if there's any holes in there because you don't want to miss anything

590
00:45:54.30 --> 00:45:57.78
And the only way to be able to do that is if you're detached obviously

591
00:45:57.78 --> 00:45:59.78
but

592
00:46:00.54 --> 00:46:02.54
default

593
00:46:02.90 --> 00:46:05.98
Subordinate your ego and let's go with Dave's plan sounds good man

594
00:46:05.98 --> 00:46:10.46
And and and that's how you roll. That's how you solve that problem and

595
00:46:11.10 --> 00:46:15.44
By the way, the only part of you that really thinks your plan is better

596
00:46:15.44 --> 00:46:20.82
It's just your ego because because here's what you're planning what your planning is something that you can't know

597
00:46:21.38 --> 00:46:23.86
You're planning something that's gonna happen in the future

598
00:46:23.86 --> 00:46:29.58
Something that's gonna happen on enemy territory or against a competitor or in a market. You don't understand. That's what you're doing

599
00:46:30.30 --> 00:46:32.42
So when you come up with a plan

600
00:46:33.18 --> 00:46:36.26
It's about something that you can't guarantee anyways

601
00:46:36.78 --> 00:46:40.58
So why would you commit or over commit to it doesn't make any sense?

602
00:46:44.02 --> 00:46:46.02
So be careful that

603
00:46:46.54 --> 00:46:48.54
I

604
00:46:48.54 --> 00:46:55.50
Don't want to overemphasize leadership of senior officers my interest extends to leaders of all ranks

605
00:46:55.50 --> 00:47:03.26
I would caution you to always remember that an essential qualification of a good leader is the ability to recognize select and train junior leaders. I

606
00:47:04.50 --> 00:47:11.98
Would like to quote from a book entitled the born at Reveley and written by Colonel Red reader. I have this book in the queue by the way

607
00:47:11.98 --> 00:47:17.46
Colonel reader was on a trip for General Marshall and one of his assignments was to inquire into his junior leadership

608
00:47:17.46 --> 00:47:22.82
This is an account of his conversation with Colonel Bryant more on Guadalcanal

609
00:47:23.66 --> 00:47:26.58
Colonel more I said tell me something about leadership. I

610
00:47:27.50 --> 00:47:30.34
Had hit a sensitive spot. He forged ahead leadership

611
00:47:30.82 --> 00:47:36.38
The greatest problem here is the leaders and you have to find some way to weed out the weak ones

612
00:47:36.70 --> 00:47:39.42
It's tough to do this when you're in combat

613
00:47:39.42 --> 00:47:46.26
The platoon leaders who cannot command who cannot foresee things and who cannot act on spur of the moment

614
00:47:46.86 --> 00:47:52.26
In an emergency or a distinct detriment. That's what's so interesting

615
00:47:52.26 --> 00:47:55.34
This had a bunch of conversations with my last client about

616
00:47:58.10 --> 00:48:01.18
The psychology of military incompetence and

617
00:48:01.66 --> 00:48:07.34
The authoritarian mindset and how people do well that do well in garrison

618
00:48:07.34 --> 00:48:09.34
Don't do well in combat

619
00:48:10.46 --> 00:48:16.30
And that's what he's talking about people who can't foresee things people who cannot act on the spur of the moment in an emergency

620
00:48:17.58 --> 00:48:22.66
He goes on to say here. It's hot here as you can see men struggle. They get heat exhaustion

621
00:48:22.66 --> 00:48:25.54
They come out vomiting and throwing away equipment

622
00:48:26.06 --> 00:48:31.90
The leaders must be leaders and they must be alert to establish straggler lines and stop this thing

623
00:48:31.90 --> 00:48:38.42
The men have been taught to take salt tablets, but the leaders don't see to this the result heat exhaustion

624
00:48:39.82 --> 00:48:42.30
The good leaders seem to get killed

625
00:48:42.82 --> 00:48:44.94
The poor leaders get the men killed

626
00:48:45.58 --> 00:48:50.22
The big problem is leadership and getting the shoulder straps on the right people

627
00:48:53.02 --> 00:48:59.10
60 millimeter Japanese mortars fit shells fell about 30 yards away and attacked a number of coconut trees

628
00:48:59.10 --> 00:49:05.42
I lost interest in taking dictation and the colonel stopped talking when the salvo was over and things were quiet again

629
00:49:05.42 --> 00:49:09.38
Bryant Moore said where was I you saw that patrol?

630
00:49:09.38 --> 00:49:13.94
I tell you this not one man in 50 can lead a patrol in this jungle

631
00:49:13.94 --> 00:49:20.86
If you can find one who the good patrol if you can find out who the good patrol leaders are before you hit a combat zone

632
00:49:21.10 --> 00:49:23.10
You have found something

633
00:49:23.98 --> 00:49:26.78
I have had to get rid of about two people

634
00:49:26.78 --> 00:49:33.02
I have had to get rid of about 25 officers because they just weren't leaders

635
00:49:33.02 --> 00:49:37.74
I had to make the battalion commander weed out poor junior leaders

636
00:49:37.82 --> 00:49:44.10
This process is continuous our junior leaders are finding out that they must know more about their men

637
00:49:44.38 --> 00:49:46.66
The good leaders know their men

638
00:49:52.46 --> 00:49:54.46
Man

639
00:49:54.46 --> 00:49:56.46
The

640
00:49:57.34 --> 00:50:04.14
It's weird that he would wrap up that section with good leaders know their men after talking about all these other things good leaders know their men

641
00:50:06.86 --> 00:50:10.26
He goes on now this is getting out of the quote from that book

642
00:50:11.18 --> 00:50:16.30
Raised it or born at Reveley says what are the distinguishing characteristics of a leader?

643
00:50:17.34 --> 00:50:20.42
There are many essential characteristics that he must possess

644
00:50:20.42 --> 00:50:24.70
But I will mention a few that come to mind as perhaps most important first

645
00:50:24.78 --> 00:50:29.86
He must know his job without necessarily being a specialist in every phase of it a few years ago

646
00:50:29.86 --> 00:50:35.06
It was suggested that all engineering subjects be eliminated from required studies at West Point. I

647
00:50:36.02 --> 00:50:40.30
Objected for example bridge building is a specialty for engineers yet

648
00:50:40.30 --> 00:50:46.78
I think every senior officer should have some idea of what is involved when we reach the Rhine in World War two

649
00:50:46.78 --> 00:50:53.74
It was not necessary that I know how to build a bridge, but it was very helpful that I knew what was involved so that I could see

650
00:50:53.74 --> 00:51:01.74
That the bridge engineers received proper support to in tonnage allowed and the an idea of the time involved

651
00:51:02.82 --> 00:51:10.30
Specialties dominate almost every problem faced today by the military leader or the business manager the this individual must get deeply

652
00:51:10.30 --> 00:51:13.80
Enough into his problem that he can understand it and intelligently manage it

653
00:51:13.80 --> 00:51:18.92
Without going so far as to become a specialist himself in every phase of the problem

654
00:51:18.96 --> 00:51:24.88
You don't have to be a tank expert in order to effectively use a tank of your command

655
00:51:27.84 --> 00:51:28.80
Yeah

656
00:51:28.80 --> 00:51:34.20
This makes me think at the basic school for the Marine Corps is that philosophy is I don't care what your job is gonna be

657
00:51:34.20 --> 00:51:36.20
You're gonna have some exposure to everything else

658
00:51:36.40 --> 00:51:38.000
You're not gonna be an expert in any of it

659
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:44.76
But it sure does help a lot if I'm gonna work with you and you're an engineer and have some framework for what you're doing

660
00:51:44.76 --> 00:51:46.44
So I know what the challenges are

661
00:51:46.44 --> 00:51:50.04
So I know how to help you or support you or make sure you're at least getting what you need

662
00:51:50.48 --> 00:51:55.28
And the idea of not being a specialist but knowing what all your specialists are dealing with I

663
00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.40
Mean that served me well, and I think the very start for that for them for me was the Marine Corps the basic school

664
00:52:01.32 --> 00:52:04.60
Yeah, they get that baseline set for everybody everything

665
00:52:04.60 --> 00:52:09.80
Yep, and and look when you're at a business or you go into a business or you take over a business or you move into a new department

666
00:52:11.08 --> 00:52:16.60
You don't have to become an expert but to sit down and walk around walk the floor

667
00:52:17.08 --> 00:52:24.92
Go and do that thing, you know go go get on the manufacturing line and do the various parts of the job

668
00:52:25.20 --> 00:52:28.08
So you look you're gonna be terrible at it. You've never done it before

669
00:52:29.12 --> 00:52:31.12
But go do it. Yeah, and

670
00:52:31.12 --> 00:52:37.80
It's crazy how how easy that is and how much and I'm not exaggerating like in one day in one day

671
00:52:37.80 --> 00:52:40.76
How much you can learn from just spending one day out there?

672
00:52:40.92 --> 00:52:47.72
You do not need nor do they expect you to be an expert on any of this stuff and not just the mileage you get by just building the

673
00:52:47.80 --> 00:52:49.40
relationship but

674
00:52:49.40 --> 00:52:51.40
The amount of time that it takes to get

675
00:52:52.24 --> 00:52:56.56
Exposure what they're doing is actually really small. You don't need that much time to get out there on the line

676
00:52:56.56 --> 00:53:01.000
I go, oh, hey, let me try that. Hey, can I see that? Hey, how does this work and just in a few hours what you can learn?

677
00:53:01.36 --> 00:53:07.68
Especially when you're starting at zero if you're starting at zero you're gonna learn infinitely more in just a little bit of time

678
00:53:07.68 --> 00:53:11.76
So if you see this some giant daunting task, it's really not it's not nearly as hard

679
00:53:11.76 --> 00:53:15.80
And I remember this learning about you know inside of a squadron all the different things worked

680
00:53:15.96 --> 00:53:20.16
You spent an hour or two with somebody and just sit with them and have them show you their job

681
00:53:20.16 --> 00:53:23.52
And then you do their job for a little bit in a couple hours what you can learn from that

682
00:53:23.52 --> 00:53:27.88
Yeah, and compared to the people that didn't do that. You're a freaking expert totally

683
00:53:28.68 --> 00:53:30.68
so

684
00:53:30.80 --> 00:53:39.32
All right, here's one of his one to remember Thomas J. Watson of IBM once said that genius in an executive is

685
00:53:39.52 --> 00:53:44.52
The ability to deal successfully with matters. He does not understand

686
00:53:44.52 --> 00:53:51.56
So good and and my note when I read that is

687
00:53:54.16 --> 00:53:56.16
The genius

688
00:53:56.60 --> 00:54:01.88
What will make this person be able to successfully deal with matters that they don't understand is

689
00:54:02.72 --> 00:54:07.88
Having the humility to admit that they don't understand and saying all right

690
00:54:08.44 --> 00:54:11.60
Let's let's get this figured out because I don't know what to do right now

691
00:54:11.60 --> 00:54:18.28
This leads to another principle of leadership which I have often found neglected both in military and in business

692
00:54:18.28 --> 00:54:21.80
While you need not be a specialist in all phases of your job

693
00:54:21.80 --> 00:54:26.48
You should have a proportionate degree of interest in every aspect of it

694
00:54:27.60 --> 00:54:33.32
And those concerned your subordinates should be aware of your interest. That's what you just talked about Dave

695
00:54:34.60 --> 00:54:40.60
You must get around and show interest in what your subordinates are doing even if you don't know much about

696
00:54:40.60 --> 00:54:44.60
the technique of their work and when you are making these visits

697
00:54:44.60 --> 00:54:48.28
Try to pass out praise when do as well as corrections or criticism. There you go

698
00:54:48.60 --> 00:54:52.60
It's what you just talked about go light on the criticism part. You don't even know what the hell you're doing

699
00:54:53.60 --> 00:54:56.60
Let me show you how to work that thing there son. No, don't do that

700
00:54:58.60 --> 00:55:01.60
We tend to speak up only when things go wrong

701
00:55:01.60 --> 00:55:08.60
This is such a well-recognized fact that a complete department is an essential part of many business firms to my knowledge

702
00:55:08.60 --> 00:55:15.60
No comparable faculty exists anywhere to expedite the handling of praise for a job well done

703
00:55:16.60 --> 00:55:18.60
It's a good point

704
00:55:19.60 --> 00:55:24.60
We all get enough criticism and we learn to take it even Sir Winston Churchill despite his matchless

705
00:55:24.60 --> 00:55:33.60
accomplishment found occasion to say I have benefited enormously from criticism and at no point did I suffer from any perceptible lack thereof

706
00:55:33.60 --> 00:55:39.60
So he's always getting criticized even Churchill but let us remember that praise also has a role to play

707
00:55:40.60 --> 00:55:46.60
Napoleon was probably the finest exponent of this principle of recognition through his use of a quarter inch of ribbon to improve the

708
00:55:46.60 --> 00:55:52.60
Moral and get results since the quote from Napoleon where he said you can basically get someone to do anything by giving him a little ribbon

709
00:55:53.60 --> 00:55:55.60
And he's right

710
00:55:57.60 --> 00:56:00.60
Both mental and physical energy are essential

711
00:56:00.60 --> 00:56:07.60
To successful leadership how many good leaders have you known who were lazy or weak or who couldn't stand the strain

712
00:56:08.60 --> 00:56:12.60
Sherman was a good example of a leader without standing mental and physical energy

713
00:56:12.60 --> 00:56:15.60
I cite him with some trepidation because some of you may be from Georgia

714
00:56:16.60 --> 00:56:21.60
However during the advance from chat chat a new job chat a new guy to Atlanta

715
00:56:21.60 --> 00:56:26.60
He often went for days with only two or three hours of sleep per night and was constantly in the saddle

716
00:56:26.60 --> 00:56:36.60
Reconning and often knew the dispositions and terrain so well that he could maneuver the enemy out of position without a serious fight and with minimum losses

717
00:56:37.60 --> 00:56:47.60
Conversely a sick commander is of limited value it is not fair to the troops under him to have a leader who's not functioning 100%

718
00:56:47.60 --> 00:56:51.60
I had to receive relieve several senior commanders during World War two because of illness

719
00:56:51.60 --> 00:56:56.60
It is often pointed out that Napoleon didn't lose a major battle until Waterloo where he was a sick man

720
00:56:57.60 --> 00:56:59.60
So lazy weak

721
00:57:00.60 --> 00:57:01.60
That's a problem

722
00:57:03.60 --> 00:57:07.60
A leader should possess human understanding and consideration for others

723
00:57:08.60 --> 00:57:14.60
Men are not robots and should not be treated as though they were machines so this goes back to the idea of AI

724
00:57:15.60 --> 00:57:18.60
But I think you're I think you're a very good leader

725
00:57:18.60 --> 00:57:26.60
I think you're I think they're pretty easily going to be able to put morale and emotion emotional programming into

726
00:57:28.60 --> 00:57:33.60
Leadership decision-making oh squints squints over there from echo Charles. Am I wrong?

727
00:57:35.60 --> 00:57:40.60
Eventually, I mean I guess that the argument for AI is like you know how AI works

728
00:57:40.60 --> 00:57:45.60
It's like it's a constantly learning learning learning learning right from like input input learn learn learn

729
00:57:45.60 --> 00:57:50.60
So in the beginning it'll probably be like freakin you watch a demolition man

730
00:57:50.60 --> 00:57:56.28
Remember I'm moving I think I'm pretty sure I walked out of the movie demolition man

731
00:57:56.28 --> 00:58:00.000
Okay, so and then I miss something big like it was dumb

732
00:58:01.60 --> 00:58:05.60
I'm not gonna argue whether it was a semester song. Yeah, yeah, I walked out of it was dumb

733
00:58:05.60 --> 00:58:10.60
So it was dumb seemingly was really dumb right seemingly but oh there's an odd layer

734
00:58:10.60 --> 00:58:17.60
I missed out on yet metaphorical masterpiece that I get snuck by me, but I wouldn't say masterpiece. Okay, but

735
00:58:18.40 --> 00:58:25.40
There's a part on there real subtle part subtlety subtlety where Simon Phoenix, right? He's a bad guy

736
00:58:25.40 --> 00:58:30.96
I got a cryo prison whatever and he goes to one of these booths as these booths rolling around like that

737
00:58:30.96 --> 00:58:35.12
There's just a booth for like whatever you want kind of a thing. It's like an ATM for anything

738
00:58:35.12 --> 00:58:41.60
So this booth can give you like it's like the internet is on there and all this stuff

739
00:58:42.04 --> 00:58:44.04
But it can give you a mood adjustment

740
00:58:44.60 --> 00:58:50.20
So if you're like, oh, I want to ego boost right and you press the buttons or whatever and it says boy

741
00:58:50.20 --> 00:58:51.96
You look great today

742
00:58:51.96 --> 00:58:56.64
Like that can stuff but in real life that wouldn't really work right because you're programming the machine

743
00:58:56.64 --> 00:59:00.60
I need to go but oh you look great today a machine giving me compliments after I asked it like brother

744
00:59:00.60 --> 00:59:05.66
That doesn't work like that, but the AI thinks it does see I'm saying so if you're trying to program

745
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:14.16
Emotional stuff like morale boosting stuff in an AI at first. It's gonna look like that. Yeah, but but here's my counter argument

746
00:59:14.16 --> 00:59:19.16
I don't really want to go full like Lex Friedman like discussion on AI because I don't know enough about it

747
00:59:19.16 --> 00:59:20.48
but

748
00:59:20.48 --> 00:59:22.40
you could probably

749
00:59:22.40 --> 00:59:29.20
Put a program in there that we would say something like hey echo Charles. I've assessed your appearance and

750
00:59:29.20 --> 00:59:30.68
and

751
00:59:30.68 --> 00:59:36.56
Comparatively to the rest of the population today. You are in the top 6% of looking good

752
00:59:37.64 --> 00:59:41.32
Congratulations echo go have a fun day. So now all of a sudden it's giving you some data

753
00:59:41.32 --> 00:59:46.44
Here's my hypothesis. I get it and look that's not a terrible assessment

754
00:59:46.48 --> 00:59:53.44
But I would think I think anyway and try search your emotional soul not you jockeau Dave

755
00:59:54.16 --> 00:59:56.68
search your emotional like party where like

756
00:59:56.68 --> 01:00:03.56
Even if it's true if it's coming from a machine who cares it has to come from a actual person who quote-unquote

757
01:00:04.08 --> 01:00:09.72
Understands me at the very least as a person. So I'm saying so like a ego boost from machine

758
01:00:09.72 --> 01:00:12.20
Just the mere fact that it's not from an actual person

759
01:00:12.88 --> 01:00:17.12
Brats it's hard. Yeah, I can't have you ever had any kind of like

760
01:00:18.20 --> 01:00:19.80
feelings

761
01:00:19.80 --> 01:00:21.80
Towards an inanimate object

762
01:00:21.80 --> 01:00:26.96
Like a guitar like you've got like real expensive computers, right? Yes

763
01:00:26.96 --> 01:00:30.20
Have you ever had a computer that you kind of had like some kind of bond with no?

764
01:00:30.80 --> 01:00:36.28
No, and here to answer your question Dave. Did you have any kind of bond with your airplane? Oh hell? Yeah, absolutely

765
01:00:36.28 --> 01:00:42.000
But it's like I have feelings for the airplanes that I flew there. I remember looking at I'm going down

766
01:00:42.32 --> 01:00:46.22
Right, but I would be surprised if you didn't look at a heavy machine gonna go

767
01:00:46.22 --> 01:00:51.04
I really like the way you look today. Yeah, but the machine isn't the thing that's giving you the compliment

768
01:00:51.04 --> 01:00:56.48
It's like it'll have to do I think you know, I don't know I could be wrong. I'm not Lex Friedman. You guys know this

769
01:00:58.24 --> 01:01:04.32
It's usually has to do a lot with or probably everything to do with what you specifically did in

770
01:01:04.92 --> 01:01:13.000
With this machine that gave you certain personal feelings like personal unique very unique in like not replicable

771
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:19.08
You got to remember like right now. There's chat. There's people right now. There's bots on Twitter today

772
01:01:19.08 --> 01:01:24.54
We're probably less today, but there's there's bots and stuff out there that are having conversations with people and people can't tell

773
01:01:24.96 --> 01:01:29.72
Yeah, they can't tell yes true, but once they knew it was a bot if you tell them it's a bot brother

774
01:01:29.72 --> 01:01:36.92
It's gonna change right they're not gonna be oh equally as in lover only thing you got to get over is like the little hump of

775
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.96
You just tell people like oh no this thing can actually assess

776
01:01:41.16 --> 01:01:46.04
Wait where you're at and then people go okay. This computer is smarter than your wife

777
01:01:46.04 --> 01:01:52.28
So your wife telling you look good is fine, but this thing telling you look good is factual. So there you go

778
01:01:53.32 --> 01:01:56.60
Believe it you go up. What'd you say ego boost you go boost? Yeah

779
01:01:56.60 --> 01:02:02.38
Go boost I'm trying to think like because not now that you put it like that. I kind of like yeah, maybe but like I

780
01:02:02.96 --> 01:02:08.84
Still it's hard. Let me give you an example. Let me give you an example JP to know sure hell

781
01:02:08.84 --> 01:02:15.40
Yeah, he was wearing like a wrist strap that told him if he was tired or not

782
01:02:15.40 --> 01:02:21.56
Yeah, he believed it. Yeah, he took it off. Yeah, because he was having bad days

783
01:02:22.28 --> 01:02:28.62
Because that thing told him he was tired. He didn't feel tired, but he that thing said hey, you're tired and he was like oh damn

784
01:02:28.62 --> 01:02:33.74
I'm tired. Oh, yeah, and so he did that happened a few times. He said you know what this is bullshit

785
01:02:33.76 --> 01:02:39.52
Yeah, but so he believed the machine it affected his mood because it had the data

786
01:02:39.52 --> 01:02:45.72
Hmm so end of discussion. I think you can just stand down bro because I think that he's got proven wrong

787
01:02:47.36 --> 01:02:50.32
So like if it was like an evil you got ego down

788
01:02:52.12 --> 01:02:54.52
So if it was like a report card like

789
01:02:55.16 --> 01:03:00.56
Hmm a report card that maybe cuz think about it. Okay, this team needs a morale boost

790
01:03:00.56 --> 01:03:02.56
They're losing right or whatever

791
01:03:02.92 --> 01:03:07.80
So what what would the machine do like assess the good things that are happening and report back?

792
01:03:07.80 --> 01:03:09.80
Yeah, imagine imagine at halftime

793
01:03:10.28 --> 01:03:15.96
The the coach comes in and he's like hey, I'm checking your your whoops straps right now

794
01:03:15.96 --> 01:03:17.40
I'm checking your data

795
01:03:17.40 --> 01:03:21.48
Everyone has more energy than they had at halftime than we did at the last game that we won

796
01:03:21.48 --> 01:03:24.62
You guys have the power to get and that was true. Yeah

797
01:03:25.40 --> 01:03:27.04
Yeah

798
01:03:27.04 --> 01:03:31.56
So that's that machine can you affect your mood is what I'm saying

799
01:03:31.56 --> 01:03:38.48
I guess yep, yep, I guess like hidden information or something that you might be ignoring like that something like that

800
01:03:38.48 --> 01:03:41.12
I'm saying that a

801
01:03:42.68 --> 01:03:44.12
Machine

802
01:03:44.12 --> 01:03:48.56
Can affect someone's mood. Hey, I you know what I have a machine affect my mood

803
01:03:49.24 --> 01:03:55.40
Damn printer doesn't work. Yeah, right printer doesn't work all of a sudden. I'm like damn. I'm mad. I get angry

804
01:03:56.04 --> 01:03:58.04
I think that's a different thing, but

805
01:03:58.04 --> 01:04:02.96
All right, so check this out what we're saying is men are not robots

806
01:04:02.96 --> 01:04:09.32
It should not be treated as if they were and he says this I do not by any means suggest coddling

807
01:04:09.72 --> 01:04:14.50
But men are highly intelligent complicated beings who respond favorable

808
01:04:15.04 --> 01:04:23.28
Favorably to human understanding and consideration by this means their leader will get maximum effort from each of them

809
01:04:23.28 --> 01:04:31.32
He will also get loyalty and in this connection. It is well to remember that loyalty goes down as well as up

810
01:04:31.36 --> 01:04:37.32
The sincere leader will go to bat for his subordinates when such action is needed

811
01:04:38.56 --> 01:04:41.000
Take care of your people and your people will take care of you a

812
01:04:43.12 --> 01:04:45.12
Good leader must sometimes be stubborn

813
01:04:46.24 --> 01:04:52.000
Here I am reminded of the West Point cadet prayer a leader must be able to choose the harder right

814
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:58.72
Instead of the easier wrong armed with courage of his convictions. He must often fight to defend them

815
01:04:59.44 --> 01:05:03.28
Then he has to come to decision after thorough analysis and

816
01:05:04.04 --> 01:05:08.28
When he assures, he's right. He must stick to it even to the point of stubbornness

817
01:05:08.92 --> 01:05:12.48
Grant furnishes a good illustration of this trait

818
01:05:12.60 --> 01:05:18.36
He never knew what he was supposed to be licked a less stubborn man might have lost at Shiloh

819
01:05:18.36 --> 01:05:25.56
Maybe you've heard the story of Grant in the Richmond campaign when after being up all night making his reconnaissance and

820
01:05:25.96 --> 01:05:30.44
Formulating and issuing orders. He laid down under a tree and fell asleep sometime later

821
01:05:30.44 --> 01:05:37.68
A courier rode up and informed the general that disaster had hit his right flank and that his troops at the end of that line

822
01:05:37.68 --> 01:05:39.68
Were in full retreat

823
01:05:39.68 --> 01:05:41.48
General Grant sat up

824
01:05:41.48 --> 01:05:48.68
Shook his head to clear the cobwebs and said it can't be so and went back to sleep and

825
01:05:48.68 --> 01:05:53.04
It wasn't so he had confidence in himself and in his subordinate leaders

826
01:05:54.24 --> 01:05:55.48
so

827
01:05:55.48 --> 01:05:57.000
There you go, and we just

828
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.28
Did you have a chance to listen to Civil War? No, not yet excursion

829
01:06:00.32 --> 01:06:07.28
We're just about the grants just about the role in the scene from the east or sorry from the west the Western or the Western campaign

830
01:06:07.28 --> 01:06:09.28
Grants about the role in there because he's winning

831
01:06:09.28 --> 01:06:13.56
So it's gonna be it's gonna be cool to get into him as a leader

832
01:06:14.64 --> 01:06:15.88
He goes on to say this

833
01:06:15.88 --> 01:06:20.80
I do not mean to infer that there is always just one solution to a problem usually there's one best

834
01:06:21.16 --> 01:06:27.60
Solution but any good plan boldly executed is better than indecision. There is usually more than one way to attain results

835
01:06:27.60 --> 01:06:31.28
This goes back to what I was saying earlier. That's why I'll go with Dave's plan. I'll go to the echoes plan

836
01:06:31.28 --> 01:06:35.60
I don't care. I don't care because the time we waste arguing about which way is better is

837
01:06:35.60 --> 01:06:40.36
Time of indecision and that's what's gonna cost us

838
01:06:40.36 --> 01:06:45.16
So Dave you got a decent plan a minimally viable plan cool go execute

839
01:06:45.60 --> 01:06:48.64
Damn we we work together right now Dave

840
01:06:49.24 --> 01:06:51.24
You are executing things like

841
01:06:52.52 --> 01:06:54.52
wildly

842
01:06:55.24 --> 01:07:01.24
Often executing plans executing missions and I mean you usually

843
01:07:01.24 --> 01:07:06.72
Sometimes give me like a after-action report sometimes about how it went and everything

844
01:07:06.96 --> 01:07:10.68
You know if there's something outstanding that happened outstanding in any direction

845
01:07:10.68 --> 01:07:14.52
Maybe something good. Maybe something like oh this week we could have done this better. Yeah, but I

846
01:07:15.52 --> 01:07:17.52
mean

847
01:07:17.52 --> 01:07:20.24
That's how you have to run things so much easier

848
01:07:21.96 --> 01:07:23.96
Yeah, I'm

849
01:07:24.96 --> 01:07:28.12
There's a lot of these comments that he's made like the course that you're reading

850
01:07:28.12 --> 01:07:31.16
I'm trying to picture hearing this and

851
01:07:33.08 --> 01:07:36.60
There are times you say something and and people like oh

852
01:07:37.32 --> 01:07:40.64
He just said defend defend your convictions

853
01:07:40.64 --> 01:07:44.16
And it's like a little if you don't understand what the context of that

854
01:07:44.16 --> 01:07:47.000
There's a little bit of risk in there because that can be like hey listen

855
01:07:47.28 --> 01:07:52.16
I'm sorry, Jocko, but this is how I want to get this thing done and I'm gonna defend

856
01:07:52.64 --> 01:07:55.16
That conviction and I just can't help but think about

857
01:07:55.16 --> 01:08:00.16
Like this the example you and I that you were talking about about you and me and

858
01:08:00.80 --> 01:08:05.68
Something we have to think about echelon for all the time is a lot of times when people hear these military examples

859
01:08:06.44 --> 01:08:09.44
We're talking about the conflict. We're having with our enemies

860
01:08:10.04 --> 01:08:15.12
Like he just told that story like a lesser man when I've lost that battle. Hey listen when you're fighting like an actual enemy

861
01:08:15.56 --> 01:08:21.76
Defend those convictions, but if Jocko and I are on the same team and we're actually working together

862
01:08:21.76 --> 01:08:28.88
I am far less inclined. I'm almost not inclined at all to defend my convictions

863
01:08:28.88 --> 01:08:31.92
And of course I gotta be careful with that too. You said it well, that's a dichotomy

864
01:08:31.92 --> 01:08:35.72
I don't want to just roll over and say whatever you want, but if I come in with a plan you come into the plan

865
01:08:35.72 --> 01:08:36.92
I go oh

866
01:08:36.92 --> 01:08:40.56
Dude, that's a that's a totally reasonable plan. That plan will probably work. I

867
01:08:41.36 --> 01:08:46.08
Am not inclined to defend my convictions against you. Who is my ally?

868
01:08:46.08 --> 01:08:48.52
Who's my friend who's who wants the same out?

869
01:08:48.52 --> 01:08:51.72
You know good outcome that I want which is very different from an

870
01:08:52.76 --> 01:08:59.64
Actual opponent an actual enemy, you know in the military those are very stark obvious contrasts. We're fighting against the Nazis

871
01:08:59.64 --> 01:09:03.16
We're gonna defend those convictions to the end or like another company that

872
01:09:03.60 --> 01:09:07.000
They don't want to coexist with you want to take all your clients and run you into the ground

873
01:09:07.72 --> 01:09:13.32
So just even being cautious with the idea of defending those convictions if it's someone on my team and they have an idea

874
01:09:13.32 --> 01:09:18.32
The chances are especially if it's like most companies most people aren't dumb most people are pretty smart

875
01:09:18.32 --> 01:09:19.64
They got an idea they thought about it

876
01:09:19.64 --> 01:09:23.60
If I can find any reason to abandon my position and go your position

877
01:09:23.60 --> 01:09:27.80
I'm gonna do that unless once like you said once in a blue moon like dude

878
01:09:28.64 --> 01:09:32.24
Your idea is terrible and we just kind of talk through it. It's not that big of a deal

879
01:09:32.24 --> 01:09:36.88
I reveal a couple things move on but 99 times out of 100 your ideas and my ideas

880
01:09:37.64 --> 01:09:40.92
They're actually both gonna work and if you got an idea

881
01:09:40.92 --> 01:09:47.88
I am not inclined to be quite honest. I am not inclined to defend my idea not because I want to I don't want to upset you

882
01:09:47.88 --> 01:09:50.92
And you're my boss right it's because I don't do that's totally gonna work

883
01:09:50.92 --> 01:09:55.34
Let's just go execute on that and what that actually gives me is what you just described the end is

884
01:09:56.36 --> 01:09:59.36
and I want to be careful with this but I

885
01:10:00.20 --> 01:10:06.44
Don't spend a lot of time telling you what I plan on doing now. Listen. We are strategically aligned

886
01:10:06.44 --> 01:10:09.92
We have we as a whole company we meet and we get aligned strategically

887
01:10:09.92 --> 01:10:13.68
And I don't mean to say that people should be out there operating the total autonomy

888
01:10:13.68 --> 01:10:16.60
But in terms of this day this event this thing

889
01:10:16.60 --> 01:10:22.48
It's I don't spend a lot of time walking you through with what my plans are because six seven years into this

890
01:10:23.16 --> 01:10:26.78
We've gotten to a point where Dave can go execute and you're comfortable with that

891
01:10:27.28 --> 01:10:29.16
and my point of that is

892
01:10:29.16 --> 01:10:34.70
Because I don't spend a lot of time trying to force my way into what I want to do you've learned like hey Dave's a flexible guy

893
01:10:34.70 --> 01:10:39.52
He's he's gonna get to the same outcome his way my way doesn't really matter and that's cultivated a bunch of trust

894
01:10:39.52 --> 01:10:45.20
So defending your convictions if you're not careful can actually make you appear to be stubborn to a fault and now

895
01:10:45.32 --> 01:10:51.04
Jocko might be like is Dave gonna adjust as he needs to with this client or is he gonna just dig into his plan?

896
01:10:52.04 --> 01:10:53.000
so

897
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.08
Be careful about defending your convictions as well depending on the situation especially what it is that you're trying to accomplish

898
01:10:58.44 --> 01:11:00.32
Yeah, I think

899
01:11:00.32 --> 01:11:02.48
What could get confusing for someone?

900
01:11:03.32 --> 01:11:07.32
It's just confusing the words conviction and idea. Yeah, right

901
01:11:07.32 --> 01:11:13.72
For me to have a conviction that we should take care of our clients

902
01:11:15.16 --> 01:11:19.48
I'm gonna defend that conviction so when Dave rolls up to me and it's like hey, Jocko

903
01:11:19.48 --> 01:11:24.12
I think we could screw this client over and get some more money from them and do less work and it

904
01:11:24.56 --> 01:11:30.92
Doesn't really matter about what the outcome is. Yeah now. We're I'm not gonna be like that sounds like a good idea

905
01:11:32.36 --> 01:11:34.24
Because we're not aligned

906
01:11:34.24 --> 01:11:41.16
Now but defending ideas which is like ideas like I said earlier ideas can be pretty much worthless, right?

907
01:11:41.16 --> 01:11:44.52
And and if we are gonna assign value to an idea

908
01:11:45.12 --> 01:11:49.48
We're assigning value to my idea and assigning value to your idea

909
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.20
We can't assign a lot of value to either one of those things because neither one of them has any execution behind it yet

910
01:11:55.44 --> 01:12:01.32
So we're just basically assigning value to air. It's like it's like dogecoin, right?

911
01:12:01.32 --> 01:12:08.40
We're just kind of assigning or what is it f TT which is the f TT is what the FTX token

912
01:12:08.88 --> 01:12:12.76
So these are the guys Sam Bakeman Friedman Sam Bake Friedman

913
01:12:13.88 --> 01:12:18.56
SPF this guy ripped off billions of dollars from people and one of the ways that he did

914
01:12:18.56 --> 01:12:23.12
What was they made their own little cryptocurrency and just assigned value to it said?

915
01:12:23.12 --> 01:12:27.22
Oh, yeah, this this has this value and then they borrowed money against this thing that they made up

916
01:12:27.22 --> 01:12:32.82
And everyone said this guy's smart and he's really nice. So we're gonna give him we're gonna let him keep doing it

917
01:12:32.90 --> 01:12:38.74
That's what that's what so when we assign if I assign my idea value and I assign your idea value

918
01:12:38.74 --> 01:12:45.06
I can't assign it that much value because it's just something that we both made up. Yeah, so why am I gonna over invest in FTT?

919
01:12:45.14 --> 01:12:47.14
It's worthless

920
01:12:47.14 --> 01:12:52.02
It has no value. You also can't see the future. I can't see you. What are you arguing?

921
01:12:52.02 --> 01:12:55.46
What are you fighting me over? Yeah, the the unknown of the outcome

922
01:12:55.46 --> 01:13:01.66
So the convictions, you know when we're in combat and the conviction of hey

923
01:13:02.54 --> 01:13:08.66
We need to do to have the high ground morally with the enemy. Yes

924
01:13:09.62 --> 01:13:14.14
I'll defend that high ground. I'll defend that conviction all day now

925
01:13:15.66 --> 01:13:19.42
Even the idea of hey Dave, we need to get the high ground tactically

926
01:13:19.42 --> 01:13:21.14
I'll defend that really strong

927
01:13:21.14 --> 01:13:26.42
But you might say hey, John, listen, we got a AC 130 that's gonna be overhead and we don't need the high ground

928
01:13:26.42 --> 01:13:30.62
And we could it'd be much smarter to have these troops over here on this piece of terrain

929
01:13:30.78 --> 01:13:33.42
Which will set up a blocking force for where the enemy is located. I

930
01:13:34.86 --> 01:13:42.74
Can adjust that that's an idea and look I'm as I'm as about committed to the tactic of taking the high ground as a human could possibly be

931
01:13:43.34 --> 01:13:49.26
But I'm not going to die. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna die on it unless you know

932
01:13:49.26 --> 01:13:53.02
Dave's like well the high ground doesn't matter whatever and I'm looking at it

933
01:13:53.02 --> 01:13:57.18
Well, what are you gonna do if the enemy gets up there? Yeah, well, I'm not worried about it. Okay. Well, we need to worry about it

934
01:13:57.18 --> 01:13:59.86
So that's a different so just don't confuse

935
01:14:00.86 --> 01:14:07.14
Defending your conviction with defending your idea defending your plan defending your thoughts even and open your mind

936
01:14:08.54 --> 01:14:15.18
That that conviction versus ideas is awesome because the conviction we actually have to agree on we are going to take care of our people

937
01:14:15.18 --> 01:14:21.02
We are going to help these clients be successful and if you discover that I'm like actually what I want to do is

938
01:14:21.02 --> 01:14:25.78
I'm gonna lie to them that makes a month. Yeah, that's the conviction and then the ideas

939
01:14:26.10 --> 01:14:31.34
It's so much easier to not care so much about the ideas if you know that we're aligned on that conviction like oh

940
01:14:31.38 --> 01:14:35.50
Dave's going a totally different direction. He's gonna get to that high ground. It's just his way of doing it

941
01:14:35.50 --> 01:14:41.22
But he actually sees we that clients getting taken care of or give an impact and my point to that is

942
01:14:41.22 --> 01:14:46.70
We don't talk about the tactical ideas nearly as much as we used to because you're like, oh, yeah, I know where he's going

943
01:14:46.70 --> 01:14:48.70
I know what Dave's doing and and

944
01:14:48.90 --> 01:14:52.46
Yeah, we have a pretty good thing going and you don't just cut people loose

945
01:14:52.62 --> 01:14:56.78
But if you can be aligned the convictions, it's so much easier to be flexible the ideas. Yeah, like

946
01:14:57.70 --> 01:14:59.70
worst case scenario

947
01:15:00.18 --> 01:15:06.22
You didn't actually you like as long as you're not going against the convictions that we share

948
01:15:06.22 --> 01:15:10.90
There's actually nothing you can screw up bad enough to like have a problem, right?

949
01:15:11.62 --> 01:15:15.74
You know, there's nothing that we can't clean up on a phone call. We're like, hey, dude

950
01:15:15.74 --> 01:15:16.38
I

951
01:15:16.38 --> 01:15:17.94
I over indexed a little bit

952
01:15:17.94 --> 01:15:23.06
We spent a little too much money on this client and I owe them another two gigs and and by the way they really want you

953
01:15:23.06 --> 01:15:26.02
So you're coming to it. I'm like, all right, cool, right, you know, Jamie

954
01:15:26.66 --> 01:15:33.38
Booking me for free gigs across America. Jamie Cochran. Thank you. No, don't call Jamie. She's not doing anymore. All right

955
01:15:33.38 --> 01:15:39.02
Going back to the book here another quality of leadership that comes to mind is self-confidence

956
01:15:39.02 --> 01:15:43.62
You must have confidence in yourself your unit and your subordinate commanders and in your plan

957
01:15:44.06 --> 01:15:46.06
This recalls a couple of incidents

958
01:15:46.42 --> 01:15:52.14
Just before the invasion of Normandy in 1944 a story went around that some of the units were making the assault on the beaches

959
01:15:52.26 --> 01:15:57.06
That they would suffer 100% casualties that none of them would come back. I

960
01:15:57.70 --> 01:16:02.22
Found it necessary to visit these units and talk to all ranks. I told them that of course

961
01:16:02.22 --> 01:16:08.78
We would suffer casualties, but certainly our losses would not be a hundred percent and that with our air and naval support

962
01:16:08.78 --> 01:16:10.50
We would succeed

963
01:16:10.50 --> 01:16:15.30
After our landing a correspondent told me that on his way across the channel in one of the late leading

964
01:16:15.58 --> 01:16:21.30
LSTs he had noticed a sergeant reading a novel struck by the seeming lack of concern

965
01:16:21.74 --> 01:16:26.58
By this sergeant. He asked aren't you worried? How can you be reading at a time like this?

966
01:16:26.74 --> 01:16:31.18
The staff sergeant replied no, I'm not worried general Bradley said everything will go all right

967
01:16:31.18 --> 01:16:33.18
So why should I worry?

968
01:16:34.46 --> 01:16:35.74
Yeah

969
01:16:35.74 --> 01:16:36.86
confidence

970
01:16:36.86 --> 01:16:43.46
Right there in the middle right there nice and balanced confidence not overconfident not arrogant, but not self-doubting

971
01:16:43.58 --> 01:16:47.86
That's for sure. I might relate another incident where there's a lack lack of confidence

972
01:16:48.38 --> 01:16:49.74
Where there's a lack of confidence

973
01:16:49.74 --> 01:16:56.62
I had to relieve a senior commander because I learned his men had lost confidence in him this meant of course that we could not

974
01:16:56.62 --> 01:17:00.54
Expect maximum performance by that division after being relieved

975
01:17:01.30 --> 01:17:08.70
The officer came through month came back through my headquarters and showed me a file of statements given to him by his request

976
01:17:08.70 --> 01:17:12.98
I am sure by the burgo master of all the towns his divisions had passed through

977
01:17:14.02 --> 01:17:18.50
If he had confidence in himself, he would not have felt the need for those letters

978
01:17:20.90 --> 01:17:22.90
Pretty good one

979
01:17:22.90 --> 01:17:27.86
So you shouldn't fire me look at everyone loves me. I've got a bunch of letters to prove it. Okay

980
01:17:29.78 --> 01:17:30.74
After seeing the letters

981
01:17:30.74 --> 01:17:37.46
I told the officer that if I had ever had any doubts as to whether to relieve him those doubts were now removed

982
01:17:37.46 --> 01:17:41.14
His letters proved beyond question that he had lost confidence in himself

983
01:17:41.14 --> 01:17:44.46
So it's no wonder his men had lost confidence in him to a

984
01:17:45.14 --> 01:17:47.06
leader must possess

985
01:17:47.06 --> 01:17:47.98
imagination

986
01:17:47.98 --> 01:17:55.10
Whether it be an administrative decision or one mating combat the possible results of that decision must be playing to the one making it

987
01:17:55.26 --> 01:17:57.70
What will be the next step and the one after that?

988
01:17:59.42 --> 01:18:03.46
He only wrote one little two paragraph sentence about imagination

989
01:18:04.78 --> 01:18:06.78
Wish I had a little bit more

990
01:18:08.38 --> 01:18:14.02
Next while there are many other qualities which contribute to effective leadership, I will mention just one more

991
01:18:14.62 --> 01:18:16.62
But it is a very important one

992
01:18:16.62 --> 01:18:18.06
character

993
01:18:18.06 --> 01:18:20.22
This word has many meanings

994
01:18:21.18 --> 01:18:24.26
I'm applying it in the broad sense to character

995
01:18:25.10 --> 01:18:31.66
I'm applying it to the broad sense to describe a person who has high ideals who stands by them and who can be trusted absolutely

996
01:18:32.62 --> 01:18:37.18
Such a person will be respected by all those with whom he is associated and

997
01:18:37.94 --> 01:18:42.34
Such a person will readily be recognized by his associates for what he is

998
01:18:42.34 --> 01:18:45.70
Circumstances mold our character

999
01:18:46.42 --> 01:18:49.86
These circumstances affect different people in different ways

1000
01:18:50.90 --> 01:18:54.42
From exactly the same set of circumstances

1001
01:18:55.38 --> 01:18:58.26
One man may theoretically build a palace

1002
01:18:58.82 --> 01:19:03.14
While another may have difficulty building a lean to

1003
01:19:06.66 --> 01:19:10.26
It has been said that a man's character is the reality of himself

1004
01:19:10.26 --> 01:19:13.78
I don't think a man's strength of character ever changes

1005
01:19:14.66 --> 01:19:19.86
I remember a long time ago when someone told me that a mountain might be reported to have moved

1006
01:19:20.90 --> 01:19:26.82
I could believe or disbelieve it as I wished but if anyone told me that a man had to change his character, I should not believe it

1007
01:19:27.38 --> 01:19:29.38
So this is a very

1008
01:19:29.94 --> 01:19:32.58
This whole thing about character. First of all, it's a little strange

1009
01:19:33.38 --> 01:19:37.38
There's a little contradiction in there that he made which is

1010
01:19:37.38 --> 01:19:39.38
Circumstances

1011
01:19:40.26 --> 01:19:42.26
mold our character

1012
01:19:42.26 --> 01:19:46.26
So he's saying that your circumstance that your character does change

1013
01:19:46.66 --> 01:19:52.10
Based on circumstances circumstance molds your character and then he's saying that character is not going to change

1014
01:19:53.30 --> 01:19:57.62
It's more likely that a mountain gets moved than your character changes. So he's he's

1015
01:19:58.42 --> 01:20:00.42
Got a little hypocritical

1016
01:20:00.42 --> 01:20:04.10
Statement here, but I think I understand what he's getting at right?

1017
01:20:04.10 --> 01:20:06.10
I understand what he's getting at right?

1018
01:20:07.38 --> 01:20:08.74
um

1019
01:20:08.74 --> 01:20:11.30
I mean, I think he's just talking about the fact that

1020
01:20:11.94 --> 01:20:13.94
Your character is molded over time

1021
01:20:14.74 --> 01:20:20.58
But once that character is established, it can't be changed now. I can tell you this. I've seen people's character changed

1022
01:20:21.38 --> 01:20:25.06
Right. Usually it takes a pretty significant event

1023
01:20:25.70 --> 01:20:27.70
to change someone's character

1024
01:20:27.78 --> 01:20:29.78
Uh, maybe they get fired

1025
01:20:29.78 --> 01:20:34.98
But sometimes people get fired and they there's no no character change whatsoever. They're just still pissed at everybody else

1026
01:20:35.86 --> 01:20:36.82
but

1027
01:20:36.82 --> 01:20:41.46
Someone gets fired someone gets killed like something some very big event

1028
01:20:42.34 --> 01:20:44.34
Can change someone's character

1029
01:20:44.74 --> 01:20:45.70
also

1030
01:20:45.70 --> 01:20:48.26
A series of smaller events. I mean you look at someone

1031
01:20:49.70 --> 01:20:55.14
That you know the kid that you went to high school with and then they joined the marine corps and you see him seven years later

1032
01:20:55.14 --> 01:20:58.58
And you're like damn that's a that's a different dude. That's a changing character

1033
01:20:58.58 --> 01:21:01.06
So I think the character can change

1034
01:21:01.86 --> 01:21:03.86
In fact, I know it can yeah

1035
01:21:04.90 --> 01:21:09.94
I'm I'm going through what you're doing trying to latch on what he's saying and understanding where he's coming from

1036
01:21:10.50 --> 01:21:12.82
and I I 100% agree with you like

1037
01:21:13.54 --> 01:21:19.46
I have seen enough things happen in my life around people that those are character changing events like like you've described

1038
01:21:20.10 --> 01:21:22.18
I'm just thinking of the other side of it too trying to

1039
01:21:22.18 --> 01:21:28.42
Like a contemplate what he's saying is and we've talked about this when someone reveals that a character to you

1040
01:21:29.14 --> 01:21:34.34
Believe them that component of like hey if jaco if I catch and go oh dang

1041
01:21:35.78 --> 01:21:40.90
Jocos maneuvering for himself or jaco deep down is actually trying to do this for him

1042
01:21:42.58 --> 01:21:45.78
I have to understand like that's who he is and

1043
01:21:46.34 --> 01:21:47.54
There's a balance inside there too

1044
01:21:47.54 --> 01:21:51.94
But I'm just like I said I'm trying to latch on what he's talking about and we've talked about this idea of somebody's character

1045
01:21:51.94 --> 01:21:58.10
If they reveal something about themselves you you have to you cannot pretend like that's not the case or just through some conversation

1046
01:21:58.10 --> 01:22:00.82
You're gonna change that character. So I do believe that

1047
01:22:01.30 --> 01:22:06.74
Well, I don't believe I know that people's character can change and I don't think there's some age by which it it's now

1048
01:22:06.90 --> 01:22:08.90
immovable I think the older you get the harder that is

1049
01:22:09.54 --> 01:22:10.74
but

1050
01:22:10.74 --> 01:22:15.46
Don't be naive about someone's character either. Yeah, the tricky thing about that is you know

1051
01:22:17.46 --> 01:22:19.86
Many of us myself included we're

1052
01:22:19.86 --> 01:22:25.70
Optimist we're optimistic people. Yeah, and so I see Dave like short cutting something and I was like

1053
01:22:28.50 --> 01:22:32.82
He's part of my team like we're on the same team. Yeah, he's not he's not gonna do that

1054
01:22:33.78 --> 01:22:35.78
You see it again. You're like, oh, you know

1055
01:22:35.78 --> 01:22:40.02
He probably just doesn't you make a bunch of excuses for somebody and what you're saying is important

1056
01:22:40.18 --> 01:22:42.18
You need to when you see those things

1057
01:22:42.58 --> 01:22:44.58
You need to put it in the calculus, man

1058
01:22:45.38 --> 01:22:47.38
put that into the calculus

1059
01:22:47.54 --> 01:22:48.74
because it's

1060
01:22:48.74 --> 01:22:50.58
that is a

1061
01:22:50.58 --> 01:22:55.30
That is what you're dealing with right that is what you're dealing with as a person

1062
01:22:56.18 --> 01:22:58.18
Is what is their character?

1063
01:22:59.54 --> 01:23:04.34
The thing about the other huge takeaway from this which is extremely important

1064
01:23:05.46 --> 01:23:07.46
Is that you can take two people?

1065
01:23:08.10 --> 01:23:10.98
With different character put them in the exact same

1066
01:23:11.78 --> 01:23:16.26
Circumstances one person's gonna build a palace the other person's gonna have difficulty putting up a lean to

1067
01:23:16.26 --> 01:23:20.42
And what that means is you as an individual

1068
01:23:22.34 --> 01:23:27.38
You you need to take ownership of what's happening and make things happen like that's this is this is extreme ownership, right?

1069
01:23:28.34 --> 01:23:33.30
One person can look at a situation and go okay. Well, hey, there's a bunch of rock here

1070
01:23:34.82 --> 01:23:39.70
Well, I guess I'm gonna build a palace another person looks at it goes. Oh, there's a bunch of rock here

1071
01:23:40.02 --> 01:23:44.18
How am I gonna build a lean to there's no sticks like they can't figure it out

1072
01:23:44.18 --> 01:23:46.18
so

1073
01:23:47.38 --> 01:23:49.38
Getting and and

1074
01:23:49.78 --> 01:23:51.22
surrounding yourself

1075
01:23:51.22 --> 01:23:57.86
And training people this I believe is a trained attribute as well look just like every other attribute

1076
01:23:58.66 --> 01:24:02.98
Some people have a more positive outlook, right? You got to have got got the guy in your company

1077
01:24:02.98 --> 01:24:05.94
You got the guy in your platoon that's like, oh, this is never gonna work. What is it?

1078
01:24:06.50 --> 01:24:09.38
I think life babbon likes to quote the alien guys

1079
01:24:09.38 --> 01:24:13.54
Um, you know 17 days. We're not even making 17 minutes, man

1080
01:24:13.86 --> 01:24:18.18
Like that kind of at that guy. There's one of those guys in every platoon totally, right? They're in every platoon

1081
01:24:18.18 --> 01:24:21.86
They're in every company every team. There's no way we're gonna beat the competition with this thing

1082
01:24:21.86 --> 01:24:25.94
This all this is no like they're hating life. You know, it's funny. I wrote down. I didn't say it

1083
01:24:25.94 --> 01:24:29.38
But you know, that's the negative people we we have a name for them. It's naysayers, right?

1084
01:24:29.38 --> 01:24:34.98
There's an actual word for that person the English language is so filled with people like that that we have a word for them

1085
01:24:34.98 --> 01:24:38.18
It's called a naysayer, right? They exist. They're a type of person

1086
01:24:38.18 --> 01:24:44.42
But I think over time you can train people where they start looking at this problem cool, but

1087
01:24:45.14 --> 01:24:49.06
I'm not just gonna find a solution. I'm gonna take advantage of this situation. We're gonna do we're gonna do even more

1088
01:24:49.06 --> 01:24:51.54
We're gonna do even better positive things are gonna happen. Yeah

1089
01:24:52.66 --> 01:24:54.66
so

1090
01:24:54.66 --> 01:24:55.94
Take that

1091
01:24:55.94 --> 01:24:57.94
into your next scenario

1092
01:24:58.42 --> 01:25:03.94
The next circumstances you're put in and ask yourself. I'm gonna build a palace or we're gonna build a lean to which one

1093
01:25:03.94 --> 01:25:05.22
I'm gonna do

1094
01:25:05.22 --> 01:25:08.10
I'm gonna build a palace or I'm gonna struggle to build a lean to

1095
01:25:09.78 --> 01:25:11.78
That's the question

1096
01:25:12.98 --> 01:25:14.98
All right, then he goes on to say um

1097
01:25:16.10 --> 01:25:17.62
all leaders

1098
01:25:17.62 --> 01:25:24.90
Must possess these qualities which I've been discussing and the great leaders are those who possess one or more of them to an outstanding degree

1099
01:25:25.86 --> 01:25:30.82
Some leaders just miss being great because they are weak in one or more of these areas

1100
01:25:30.82 --> 01:25:36.58
There is still another ingredient in this formula for a great leader that I have left out and that is luck

1101
01:25:38.34 --> 01:25:43.54
He must have opportunity then of course when opportunity knocks he must be able to rise and open the door

1102
01:25:45.06 --> 01:25:48.18
Some may ask why do you talk about the qualities of leadership?

1103
01:25:48.90 --> 01:25:53.54
They maintain that you either have leadership or you don't that leaders are born not made

1104
01:25:54.74 --> 01:25:57.46
I suppose some are born with a certain amount of leadership

1105
01:25:57.46 --> 01:26:02.10
Frequently we see young children inclined to take charge and direct their playmates

1106
01:26:02.42 --> 01:26:10.10
The other youngsters follow these directions without protest, but I am convinced nevertheless that leadership can't be developed and improved by training

1107
01:26:10.90 --> 01:26:12.90
Well, well, there's no doubt about that. That's again

1108
01:26:14.02 --> 01:26:18.90
Um something else I stole like I hadn't read this before I wrote leadership strategy and tactics, but

1109
01:26:19.46 --> 01:26:25.06
You know, it's uh, are leaders born or made the answer? Yes, they are born and they are made

1110
01:26:25.06 --> 01:26:32.42
And he says there's no better way to develop leadership than to give the youngster or other individual a job involving

1111
01:26:32.98 --> 01:26:35.94
Responsibility and let them work it out. Again, this is my favorite leadership strategy and tactics

1112
01:26:35.94 --> 01:26:38.18
What's my favorite tool for leadership leadership?

1113
01:26:38.18 --> 01:26:40.18
Put them in charge put them in charge

1114
01:26:40.74 --> 01:26:42.74
Put them in charge. That's what you do

1115
01:26:43.70 --> 01:26:45.54
Try to avoid telling them how to do it. Boom

1116
01:26:46.42 --> 01:26:51.94
Decentralized command that for example is the basis of our whole system of combat orders, which there's a whole

1117
01:26:51.94 --> 01:26:58.50
We've talked about this on multiple different podcasts, but you know mission type orders not telling people what to do just tell them

1118
01:26:59.22 --> 01:27:01.22
What needs to get done

1119
01:27:01.22 --> 01:27:07.38
Why it needs to get done and let them go figure out we tell a subordinate unit commander that we want him to do

1120
01:27:07.70 --> 01:27:10.90
What we want him to do and then we leave him to the details

1121
01:27:12.18 --> 01:27:16.50
I think this system is largely responsible for the many fine leaders in our services today

1122
01:27:16.50 --> 01:27:19.62
We are constantly training and developing younger officers and teachers

1123
01:27:19.62 --> 01:27:22.74
Training and developing younger officers and teaching them how to respect

1124
01:27:23.46 --> 01:27:25.46
accept responsibility

1125
01:27:28.98 --> 01:27:30.98
I was saying this I said this at a muster like

1126
01:27:31.86 --> 01:27:38.98
Every moment of every day is an opportunity for training your people like anything that you do if you it's so awesome

1127
01:27:38.98 --> 01:27:40.98
You don't need to go on some big

1128
01:27:41.30 --> 01:27:46.90
Training trip with your team. No you work in the you work in a sales group. Cool

1129
01:27:46.90 --> 01:27:52.66
You're doing a presentation to some client potential client. Cool junior guy echo. Hey, you're gonna present these guys

1130
01:27:52.82 --> 01:27:55.30
Hey, you're not oh, you're not ready to present me. You're at least gonna put together a plan

1131
01:27:55.30 --> 01:27:59.38
You're gonna brief me in that way. I can get to know the numbers and then I'll brief it because you're not there yet

1132
01:28:00.10 --> 01:28:06.10
Uh, we own a construction company. Okay, cool echo. You're gonna come up with a plan on how we're gonna do this concrete pour

1133
01:28:06.98 --> 01:28:08.50
You're gonna brief me it

1134
01:28:08.50 --> 01:28:11.22
I'm gonna poke some holes in it, but you know, that's pretty much what we're going with it

1135
01:28:11.22 --> 01:28:17.06
Look if it's bad if it's horrible if it's gonna be a disaster then we're gonna stop and I'll make the adjustments

1136
01:28:17.06 --> 01:28:22.98
But you're gonna come up with a plan and that's what you do. You have the opportunity to train people all day every day with everything

1137
01:28:22.98 --> 01:28:24.98
that you do your family

1138
01:28:25.14 --> 01:28:29.06
You got to make dinner. You got to go to the grocery store. You got to

1139
01:28:29.62 --> 01:28:35.38
Get the yard cleanup. Everything one of those things is an opportunity for you train your team your your your children

1140
01:28:35.38 --> 01:28:41.70
On how to come up with a plan how to execute a plan how to build teamwork how to do things efficiently like these are all opportunities

1141
01:28:42.66 --> 01:28:45.94
So everything that you're doing all day long you have the opportunity to train people

1142
01:28:48.50 --> 01:28:50.42
He goes on to say however

1143
01:28:51.38 --> 01:28:58.02
Don't discount experience someone may remind you that Napoleon led armies before he was 30 and that Alexander the great

1144
01:28:58.98 --> 01:29:00.98
died at the age of 33

1145
01:29:00.98 --> 01:29:08.26
Napoleon as he grew older even commanded even larger armies Alexander might have been even greater had he lived longer and had more experience

1146
01:29:08.26 --> 01:29:18.10
In this respect, I especially like general Buckner's theory that judgment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgment

1147
01:29:21.46 --> 01:29:25.86
And then he goes on to say I have been asked to speak on leadership in the past

1148
01:29:25.86 --> 01:29:28.90
I have fairly well covered these same thoughts with other groups

1149
01:29:28.90 --> 01:29:32.18
Somehow however at the moment these thoughts

1150
01:29:32.74 --> 01:29:39.78
Take on added significance for me. You see my first great grandson was born a year ago. We call him fat Henry

1151
01:29:40.34 --> 01:29:46.26
What happens to his life and to the lives of his contemporaries may well be in your hands?

1152
01:29:46.90 --> 01:29:48.90
Thank you

1153
01:29:49.14 --> 01:29:51.14
And that is the end of this

1154
01:29:51.78 --> 01:29:54.98
That's the end of this particular speech and you know, I've got a book

1155
01:29:54.98 --> 01:29:59.86
I've got a manual department of the army pamphlet 600 tax 65

1156
01:30:00.58 --> 01:30:04.26
That's just got it's got a bunch. It's just it's a book of military quotes

1157
01:30:04.26 --> 01:30:11.46
And there's a bunch in there from Omar Bradley the greatest leader in the world could never win a campaign unless he understood the men he had the lead

1158
01:30:13.30 --> 01:30:15.30
Good to know

1159
01:30:15.30 --> 01:30:22.58
The American soldier is one proud is a proud one and he demands professional competence in his leaders in battle

1160
01:30:22.58 --> 01:30:26.82
He wants to know that the job is going to be done right with no unnecessary casualties

1161
01:30:27.06 --> 01:30:31.62
The non-commissioned officer wearing the chevron is supposed to be the best soldier in the platoon

1162
01:30:31.62 --> 01:30:35.62
And he's supposed to know how to perform all the duties expected the American soldier

1163
01:30:36.66 --> 01:30:38.66
The period the American American

1164
01:30:39.30 --> 01:30:45.94
Soldiers expects his sergeant to be able to teach him how to do his job and he expects even more from his officers boom

1165
01:30:47.14 --> 01:30:49.94
Fairness diligence sound preparation

1166
01:30:49.94 --> 01:30:55.30
Professional skill and loyalty are the marks of American military leadership

1167
01:30:57.22 --> 01:30:59.22
There you go

1168
01:30:59.70 --> 01:31:04.58
Another one in war there is no second prize for runner-up. It's a good one to remember

1169
01:31:05.22 --> 01:31:11.62
Another one leadership in a democratic army means firmness not harshness

1170
01:31:12.18 --> 01:31:14.18
Understanding not weakness

1171
01:31:14.18 --> 01:31:20.10
Generosity not selfishness pride not egotism

1172
01:31:21.06 --> 01:31:27.78
So he just kind of rolled out some dichotomies for you. He's giving you the balanced one and he's giving you the tendency that most people have

1173
01:31:32.02 --> 01:31:38.58
Military organizations success and success in battle depend upon discipline and a high sense of honor

1174
01:31:38.58 --> 01:31:42.74
Did they just roll out these quotes?

1175
01:31:44.26 --> 01:31:49.54
The nation today needs men who think in terms of service to their country and not in terms of their country's debt to them

1176
01:31:50.26 --> 01:31:57.06
That was 1948. I think maybe JFK jacked that one a little bit, right? Did JFK jack that sounds like a little bit

1177
01:32:00.90 --> 01:32:06.58
Remember a good leader is one who causes or inspires others staffer subordinate to the job. We already hit that one

1178
01:32:06.58 --> 01:32:08.58
Um

1179
01:32:08.66 --> 01:32:10.18
So there you go

1180
01:32:10.18 --> 01:32:11.62
this guy

1181
01:32:11.62 --> 01:32:13.62
definitely some good information

1182
01:32:14.42 --> 01:32:16.42
some good things to think about

1183
01:32:16.58 --> 01:32:18.10
and

1184
01:32:18.10 --> 01:32:22.42
You know, it's leadership and it's leadership as applied to life

1185
01:32:23.22 --> 01:32:24.82
so

1186
01:32:24.82 --> 01:32:27.46
Um more leadership more life lessons to be learned

1187
01:32:28.34 --> 01:32:30.34
Trying to get better

1188
01:32:31.14 --> 01:32:33.14
Echo Charles is trying to get better

1189
01:32:33.14 --> 01:32:34.42
Yep

1190
01:32:34.42 --> 01:32:40.10
What do you got? Yeah, I didn't really talk much about working out that much. No. No, he did say he did say physically fit

1191
01:32:40.18 --> 01:32:44.74
Oh, yeah, back. He got that one. He said you got to back it up. He did. So you can't be weak

1192
01:32:45.54 --> 01:32:47.54
He said weak leaders weak. Yeah

1193
01:32:48.50 --> 01:32:50.74
I think that was a general term, but yeah, I got squats, bro

1194
01:32:51.14 --> 01:32:56.34
I agree. He didn't say do squats or curls. He didn't say guys or girls do squats

1195
01:32:56.98 --> 01:33:01.30
But there's an inferred kind of implied thing that we all kind of heard right? Yeah, yeah

1196
01:33:01.30 --> 01:33:07.30
Yeah, let's face it if you're not doing squats, it doesn't sound like he'd kind of dig you that much given the whole nature

1197
01:33:07.62 --> 01:33:09.30
Uh of the whole deal

1198
01:33:09.30 --> 01:33:13.70
I get it but for those of us who are doing squats, which is pretty much all of us. Am I right?

1199
01:33:14.66 --> 01:33:19.46
Uh, we got some some supplementation for you, you know through this path a lot of pain in this path not pain

1200
01:33:19.86 --> 01:33:22.66
So they discover discomfort pain no suffering

1201
01:33:24.66 --> 01:33:27.94
Wait, is that pain? No suffering. No suffering. No, no, no, there's pain

1202
01:33:27.94 --> 01:33:34.42
But there's no suffering because suffering is like your meat the meaning of pain or like what the meaning you put on the pain that you get

1203
01:33:34.74 --> 01:33:36.74
I think that's like the suffering

1204
01:33:36.82 --> 01:33:39.78
Yeah, like dom's pain not suffering

1205
01:33:41.54 --> 01:33:43.30
Tear your bicep

1206
01:33:43.30 --> 01:33:45.62
Pain and suffering. Yeah, because you can't do curls

1207
01:33:47.06 --> 01:33:52.98
Seems I understand what I'm saying. I guess man. I'm not sure 100 I'm tracking you, but I don't really want to know

1208
01:33:53.54 --> 01:33:56.50
No, no, this is important because it can actually uh

1209
01:33:56.50 --> 01:33:59.94
Help diminish some of your suffering if you understand this

1210
01:34:00.82 --> 01:34:02.82
Okay, this is what I learned

1211
01:34:02.98 --> 01:34:04.98
Equal echo Charles coming in hot. What do you got?

1212
01:34:05.70 --> 01:34:12.02
So pain and suffering are two different things suffering is just like what you uh, basically the conclusion you make given the pain that you have

1213
01:34:12.18 --> 01:34:18.42
So if it's like, um, if you think your pain is like bad, it's for the negative. It's destroying you. It's whatever then that that

1214
01:34:19.06 --> 01:34:21.06
illicit suffering

1215
01:34:21.06 --> 01:34:26.50
But if you say hey, this is part of the process that I need or that I have embraced or whatever

1216
01:34:26.82 --> 01:34:29.62
It's still pain, but it's not suffering. See I'm saying

1217
01:34:30.18 --> 01:34:30.98
Yeah, okay

1218
01:34:30.98 --> 01:34:36.02
And so you can assign meaning to whatever you want including pain and you can assign whatever meaning you want to anything

1219
01:34:36.02 --> 01:34:42.18
It's sort of like building a palace instead of a lean to so I could be feeling pain and be like this is part of be building the palace

1220
01:34:42.26 --> 01:34:45.06
Or I could be feeling the pain going dude. This is horrible

1221
01:34:45.14 --> 01:34:49.06
I can I'm not gonna be able to sleep here tonight because I gotta lean to exactly right

1222
01:34:49.06 --> 01:34:51.62
All right, see so you do understand it's true

1223
01:34:52.42 --> 01:34:53.94
either way

1224
01:34:53.94 --> 01:34:58.10
When you do feel this pain eliminate the suffering you got some supplementation will help you for real

1225
01:34:58.82 --> 01:35:03.30
Basically add physically. Yeah the monk. That's it. Yeah, that's a big one because if you don't get your protein

1226
01:35:03.30 --> 01:35:06.34
Which is hard to do by the way, we established that long time ago

1227
01:35:06.42 --> 01:35:10.26
It is hard to do just to just eat food and get the amount of protein that we're gonna need

1228
01:35:11.22 --> 01:35:17.06
It's true. Yeah, yeah, but not anymore. Not now that we have moch. Yeah, I'm saying and it tastes good

1229
01:35:17.06 --> 01:35:19.70
Um the marketing guys

1230
01:35:20.82 --> 01:35:25.62
Are like well the thing is with the moch name. We got to explain what it is

1231
01:35:26.42 --> 01:35:31.78
Yeah, moch additional protein in the form of a dessert. That's the problem. Not that hard, dude. No, no, so there you go

1232
01:35:32.02 --> 01:35:35.70
Yeah, what is moch and we couldn't just call it a protein thing because it tastes too good

1233
01:35:36.26 --> 01:35:42.90
Yeah, it doesn't have the it might have the stigma of like a bro. Yeah, something. Yeah, if I said hey

1234
01:35:42.90 --> 01:35:48.02
Do you want this broccoli? But the broccoli tasted but the broccoli tasted like

1235
01:35:49.14 --> 01:35:55.30
Like really good. Yeah, it tasted like really good like key. Would I call it broccoli? No, I'd call it something else

1236
01:35:55.38 --> 01:36:01.38
Yeah, if I said hey, do you want all the goodness of broccoli, but it tastes really delicious what I call it broccoli

1237
01:36:02.42 --> 01:36:04.42
I understand what you mean. Yeah, so if I make a

1238
01:36:05.30 --> 01:36:08.66
Thing that's got protein in it a bunch of really good protein

1239
01:36:08.66 --> 01:36:12.66
And it's really good for you, but it doesn't taste like your typical trash

1240
01:36:13.38 --> 01:36:16.18
Then why would we call a protein we call a moch had to have its own word

1241
01:36:17.14 --> 01:36:20.90
Okay, so Dave Burke didn't let me tell you or let me ask you what you think about this

1242
01:36:21.78 --> 01:36:22.82
so

1243
01:36:22.82 --> 01:36:25.70
I drink moch chocolate most of the time seem saying

1244
01:36:26.66 --> 01:36:32.98
But so sometimes I want to make coffee. I make a mocha. Right. You put that's a little bit of chocolate milk in the in the coffee

1245
01:36:33.54 --> 01:36:34.82
Right, that's a mocha

1246
01:36:34.82 --> 01:36:39.22
Oh wait or chocolate whatever chocolate chocolate milk, whatever. What if I put the chocolate?

1247
01:36:39.86 --> 01:36:42.10
Mulk in the coffee. That's a mocha

1248
01:36:42.90 --> 01:36:44.18
You see you

1249
01:36:44.18 --> 01:36:45.54
So now

1250
01:36:45.54 --> 01:36:49.62
And this is my question to Dave Burke if there was a nut do you drink coffee right sometimes? No

1251
01:36:49.86 --> 01:36:53.94
Oh, bro. That's not even oh this question not for you then for my people then who drink coffee

1252
01:36:54.74 --> 01:36:56.42
If there was a

1253
01:36:56.42 --> 01:37:01.30
Mulk flavored coffee chocolate called mocha with caffeine

1254
01:37:01.94 --> 01:37:03.62
Would that be viable?

1255
01:37:03.62 --> 01:37:07.70
You're gonna get a lot of yeses on that because I'm getting hit up for that. I think so too. Yeah, right?

1256
01:37:08.26 --> 01:37:11.54
Because there's there's things like that that are out there, but they're not good for you

1257
01:37:11.70 --> 01:37:15.06
There's downside a lot of downside a lot of sugar a lot of crap in it

1258
01:37:15.86 --> 01:37:18.50
So there's things like that exist, but they're not

1259
01:37:19.22 --> 01:37:21.22
Clean right that's what I'm saying. So

1260
01:37:22.90 --> 01:37:26.82
So what if this right here right moch rtd ready to drink?

1261
01:37:28.42 --> 01:37:29.94
chocolate flavored

1262
01:37:29.94 --> 01:37:33.78
What if we'd added some coffee flavored?

1263
01:37:33.78 --> 01:37:38.98
Or just some coffee in there. See what I'm saying. Yeah, like ice coffee in there. There's demand signal for that 100%

1264
01:37:39.70 --> 01:37:45.22
Bro, I think I could get down with that. I know you could that sounds like a really cool idea

1265
01:37:48.42 --> 01:37:52.82
I see what you're saying. That's what you're saying, but I do know the team we we are very close

1266
01:37:52.82 --> 01:37:56.82
You know what I'll give you for your idea one dollar. Oh, I don't yeah. I don't want to know

1267
01:37:56.82 --> 01:38:00.98
Oh, no, all good. It's a fantasy right now. It's just a fantasy fantasy. No worth nothing

1268
01:38:01.38 --> 01:38:06.90
But I do know a group of people who can ever have somebody present an idea to you that they made you like sign an nda

1269
01:38:07.06 --> 01:38:10.02
And then they presented but them no but then they present the idea and you're like, bro

1270
01:38:10.02 --> 01:38:12.82
This is the dope or or this is the most obvious thing that like

1271
01:38:13.38 --> 01:38:19.94
Is like why I can't believe you're you're presenting this. Yeah, so I know you guys were laughing both of you laughing at me or whatever

1272
01:38:20.50 --> 01:38:21.38
When I brought this up

1273
01:38:21.38 --> 01:38:28.02
But all that stuff that I said about the ideas in the you know, the cancer pill and all that's from a from a series of real stories

1274
01:38:28.10 --> 01:38:30.34
That actually happened to me. Oh, yeah

1275
01:38:30.50 --> 01:38:36.34
Wait the actual cancer pill thing. No, no, no, cancer pill was my rebuttal to like the person saying how good their idea

1276
01:38:36.42 --> 01:38:40.42
How valuable is it was an nda day? By the way, not to mention

1277
01:38:40.50 --> 01:38:45.62
Oh, uh, let's meet up at this coffee shop and like I want to really present breath. Hold on. Oh, yeah

1278
01:38:45.94 --> 01:38:49.54
It's so annoying after ask my brother. He makes apps. So he's like

1279
01:38:49.54 --> 01:38:55.70
Yeah, really in that game or whatever. But yeah, when we when I made websites, bro, you especially back in what oh

1280
01:38:56.42 --> 01:38:57.70
Eight, yeah

1281
01:38:57.70 --> 01:39:00.02
Everyone in their mom had ideas for a website

1282
01:39:00.26 --> 01:39:03.94
Problem have a website where it does this and that and this and that nda

1283
01:39:04.42 --> 01:39:07.46
Sign it because I don't want you to steal my idea. Yep. See what I'm saying

1284
01:39:10.42 --> 01:39:16.26
But this mocha idea is very executable. Yep. No, no, that's that's probably that's gonna happen. I'll say that

1285
01:39:16.26 --> 01:39:21.30
I'll say that. So there you go. Uh, drcoffuel.com. Get mocha. Get get get some discipline go

1286
01:39:22.02 --> 01:39:26.34
Energy, you know, that's another thing like it's called an energy drink, but there's no downside

1287
01:39:26.58 --> 01:39:28.18
So it's not really

1288
01:39:28.18 --> 01:39:32.66
In the same category actually they're kind of having a new category of healthy energy drinks

1289
01:39:32.98 --> 01:39:36.74
Based on the drink that we made damn like some of the retailers that we work with

1290
01:39:37.14 --> 01:39:41.86
They're making a new category area. It's like, you know, oh, you can get this junk poison

1291
01:39:41.86 --> 01:39:45.70
Yeah, that'll give you a 30 minute a 38 minute freaking

1292
01:39:46.58 --> 01:39:50.66
Methanphetamines freak rush and then you'll crash and burn and be

1293
01:39:51.22 --> 01:39:58.10
You have type 2 diabetes or you can just take one aisle over and here we are this thing's clean and makes you feel good

1294
01:39:58.66 --> 01:40:01.22
I wonder if they'd put it one on one aisle over though

1295
01:40:03.30 --> 01:40:07.86
They put it right next to it. It's like I mean, I shouldn't say aisle one shelf over

1296
01:40:07.86 --> 01:40:12.90
Oh, yeah, like one little section over. Yeah, like this one says poison. It's got a skull and crossbones

1297
01:40:13.06 --> 01:40:15.62
Like a radioactive thing and then this one says healthy. It's got like

1298
01:40:16.26 --> 01:40:18.26
Like a strong muscle

1299
01:40:18.42 --> 01:40:23.30
Like a flexed arm a life force logo or something like this life force logo. Is that a thing?

1300
01:40:23.86 --> 01:40:29.22
Oh, okay. Maybe you need to make one. That's the beginning of my idea. Oh, that's a good idea life force life force logo

1301
01:40:29.94 --> 01:40:35.14
Yeah, yeah, but it's true though. Yeah, you're over there create logos on a bunch of ideas too. You know what I'm saying

1302
01:40:35.14 --> 01:40:40.74
I'll get the website soon. That's another part of that process. Oh, I already brought the domain

1303
01:40:41.06 --> 01:40:45.78
You know url's I own I own url's, you know, like, you know life force

1304
01:40:46.50 --> 01:40:51.14
Calm it's like just ran. I'm probably gonna buy that in the next three minutes. Probably somebody already bought it

1305
01:40:51.22 --> 01:40:54.18
so the url domain name is like

1306
01:40:55.38 --> 01:40:57.38
1% better than the idea

1307
01:40:58.26 --> 01:41:02.74
Maybe 10% because ideas are close to zero. Yeah, what's close to zero, but the url is like

1308
01:41:02.74 --> 01:41:08.58
I think literally like I mean you can get a url for for $9.99 on

1309
01:41:09.30 --> 01:41:15.30
Go Daddy is Go Daddy the one that does that? No, no, no, no, plenty plenty plenty spots domain.com

1310
01:41:15.94 --> 01:41:20.58
Go Daddy freaking there's one called the main it. Yeah, there's a lot of places. It's called a register

1311
01:41:20.58 --> 01:41:26.02
Is Go Daddy the big the big one? Yeah, that's one of the main ones for sure. That's all my all my stuff is Go Daddy

1312
01:41:26.18 --> 01:41:29.46
Yeah, do you ever look at because you got access to my go do you ever look on there and go like

1313
01:41:29.46 --> 01:41:33.94
Well, I wonder what this idiot was thinking here with freaking no w w w dot

1314
01:41:34.50 --> 01:41:36.50
planting rocks in the world

1315
01:41:36.98 --> 01:41:42.18
Comments the thing is that sounds funny to you. But to me I see all those I say, okay, I see what he was

1316
01:41:42.26 --> 01:41:47.62
I see where he was going because you look at mine. You're gonna be like, bro. What the hell is this guy thinking, bro? You

1317
01:41:48.74 --> 01:41:50.74
You haven't you haven't lived

1318
01:41:51.22 --> 01:41:55.38
Give me your worst domain name that you own if I can't I don't know it offhand

1319
01:41:55.38 --> 01:42:02.10
But a lot of them have expired too, but right that's that's back in the day when I used to stay up drinking and stuff and doing like

1320
01:42:02.58 --> 01:42:04.58
quote-unquote creative stuff

1321
01:42:05.46 --> 01:42:07.46
For 999

1322
01:42:08.34 --> 01:42:12.66
And like I said earlier, you have the whole dream in your head. Oh, yeah, play out the whole thing

1323
01:42:13.14 --> 01:42:16.74
And here's the thing it was it was bad with me for myself

1324
01:42:16.82 --> 01:42:20.74
I didn't go to other people saying like hey you do the you know, I just like you do the rest

1325
01:42:20.74 --> 01:42:26.34
That was a violation you woke up in the morning how to do the walk of shame back to your computer to see what your go daddy bill was

1326
01:42:26.82 --> 01:42:31.46
You're right. That's the funny thing. You're 100 right when you're like, what did I do last night?

1327
01:42:31.46 --> 01:42:34.34
I'm so dumb like looking at these things like what was I thinking? I think

1328
01:42:35.62 --> 01:42:37.62
But the what made it bad for me

1329
01:42:38.50 --> 01:42:40.58
Is when I drink I'd be like wait a second

1330
01:42:40.58 --> 01:42:44.98
I could do I could literally pull this off this little idea that I have like I know how to make websites

1331
01:42:44.98 --> 01:42:49.06
I don't want to make video. I know I used to go through the line of assets that you bring to the whole project

1332
01:42:49.06 --> 01:42:52.66
Yeah, and then you do it and you're like proud no one's gonna your cash

1333
01:42:53.14 --> 01:42:59.78
You're all but cash and checks like all but checking into the academy awards for your movies. It's true url

1334
01:43:00.26 --> 01:43:06.02
True. All right. So there is a url that has proved out to be pretty valuable. It's called jocofuel.com

1335
01:43:06.74 --> 01:43:09.54
Which is one that you know what I just kind of grabbed

1336
01:43:10.50 --> 01:43:13.62
Right as the whole idea came to fruition

1337
01:43:13.62 --> 01:43:21.14
You want to hear something really you might already know this but try go on go daddy or wherever and go look for urls

1338
01:43:21.30 --> 01:43:27.46
containing jocos something like something real like I don't know jocomicrophones or a jocobottle or I don't know something

1411

Re-engaged with twitter, you know twitter is a little wild right now some wildness going on. It's kind of fun

1412
01:48:41.86 --> 01:48:48.02
Yeah, so we're there. We're on the gram, but just watch out for the algorithm on all these things. You got to be careful

1413
01:48:48.74 --> 01:48:49.94

1414
01:48:49.94 --> 01:48:53.94

When everyone else out there, let's just remember that little piece that omar bradley said about

1419
01:49:17.46 --> 01:49:19.94
About circumstances and character

1420
01:49:21.62 --> 01:49:23.62
And circumstances mold our character

1421
01:49:24.58 --> 01:49:26.58
But different people

1422
01:49:27.22 --> 01:49:33.22
With different character react differently to different circumstances from the exact same circumstances

1423
01:49:34.98 --> 01:49:36.98
One man might build a palace

1424
01:49:36.98 --> 01:49:45.86
Well another man's gonna have difficulty building a lean to a palace versus lean to this is factual

1425
01:49:47.30 --> 01:49:49.22
This is factual

1426
01:49:49.22 --> 01:49:52.58
some men women go through life

1427
01:49:53.54 --> 01:49:55.54
They build a palace

1428
01:49:55.54 --> 01:49:58.42
And some men and women go through life. They build a lean to

1429
01:49:58.42 --> 01:50:05.62
We've all seen it we control our own destiny

1430
01:50:07.78 --> 01:50:13.94
So let's get out there and get after it and until next time this is dave and echo and jaco

1431
01:50:13.94 --> 01:50:27.94
Out
