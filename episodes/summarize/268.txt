You know and then of course you gotta make your own luck Next up sergeant Steven Bouchard US Marine Corps Vietnam 1967 in July of 1967 first Battalion ninth Marines took part in Operation Buffalo designed to defend the border between north and south Vietnam known as the D milleterized zone during this operation of Italian was ambushed by an entire North Vietnamese army Regiment and took very heavy casualties the first and second Battalion's third Marines were sent to rescue One-nine and stabilize the area sergeant Bouchard served as the right guide for second Battoon A company One-three the platoon's mission was to clear the area where one nine had left their dead As a company moved out of its positions Second Battoon came under heavy shell fire the platoon commander was wounded and had to be met In fact the platoon sergeant took command the NVA began firing from bunkers in the far tree line The platoon sergeant froze with fear leaving the platoon without leadership Sergeant Bouchard unhesitatingly took command of the platoon and played an important role in the company's subsequent actions Sergeant Bouchard's strong leadership pulled the platoon through the horrible task of retrieving the corpses of one nine While under enemy fire while manning a defensive position a breach in the Battalion line was created between Bouchard's platoon and the adjacent B company Bouchard's platoon counterattack into the breach and sealed off the NVA who had infiltrated the perimeter His unit then made contact with approaching forces wearing Marine gear Sergeant Bouchard ordered his Marines to hold their fire until the figures had come into Within hand grenade range at that time Bouchard decided to open fire on the approaching soldiers who were NVA wearing stolen gear from the dead of the one nine Bouchard's tactical actions broke the enemy attack and the Marines went on the offensive Sergeant Bouchard remained in command of second platoon until the unit was ordered to pull out a One three was the last unit to leave the battlefield before B52 strikes leveled the area Sergeant Bouchard was both willing and able to take responsibility of leading the platoon His tactical skills allowed the platoon to play a major role in the company's combat operation Sergeant Bouchard was able to take charge by being decisive We recorded a whole thing yesterday on for EF online on being decisive The squad leaders did not respond to the platoon sergeant who was too fearful to lead Sergeant Bouchard took decisive action and was not afraid to make tough decisions and carry out difficult tasks And once again, what do you do? The Japanese began a ferocious attack in the dark rainy night intense fighting followed and soon the machine gun unit on Bazelone's right was overrun by screaming Japanese soldiers hurling grenades and firing rifles At the same time Bazelone's machine gun started running low on ammunition Bazelone knew that the enemy That had broken through on his right were between him and the ammunition dump But he decided that if his gun teams were not re-supplied the positions would fall Sergeant Bazelone took off his heavy mud-caked boots stripped himself of all unnecessary gear and sprinted down the trail After returning with several belts of ammunition he set out for the unmanned machine gun pits to his right knowing that those heavy weapons were vital Tools in the defense of the ridge when he got back to the gun positions He found two unoccupied machine guns jammed and ran back to get one of his own He ordered a team to follow him after Bazelone's gun crew reached their destination He immediately put them into action Bazelone lay on the ground and began repairing one of the damaged weapons once the gun was repaired and loaded He got behind the gun and began engaging targets The fight raged on and Japanese bodies began to pile up in front of the machine guns at one point sergeant Bazelone had to Direct his Marines to push back the piles of bodies to maintain clear fields of fire Several more times during the night sergeant Bazelone made trips back to the command area for desperately needed ammunition Eight separate attacks were sent Against the Marines that night and Bazelone's platoon fired over 25,000 rounds They were credited with killing an estimated 300 enemy soldiers playing a major role in Fording the Japanese attack This successful defense re-established the perimeter of the first Marine Division protected the vital airfield and led to the conquest of Guadalcanal the first island taken from the Japanese For his initiative resourcefulness and leadership in defense of the ridge sergeant Bazelone was awarded the Medal of Honor Lessons Tactically sergeant Bazelone understood his role in the defense of the ridge and the intent of the company and Battalion commanders his machine gun served a pivotal role in the company and Battalion Defense line plan He took numerous actions necessary to ensure his battalions success This included making the decision to weaken one position in order to fortify and adjacent units position to his right Sergeant Bazelone exhibited great leadership during the defense He went to great lengths to provide his unit with whatever tools were necessary to maintain the defense of the ridge His courage in braving enemy fire to deliver ammunition set an example for his Marines Unbelievable The landing units became stalled on the beach head allow allowing the Germans to reinforce their defenses The day after the landing L company of the 143rd Infantry was moving north towards Rome the Germans were waiting in ambush and the company was quickly pinned down by enemy fire Realizing that the fire was too heavy for the medics to tend to the wounded Sergeant Greg a mortar man picked up a 30 caliber light machine gun and advanced on the enemy position His Measure to accurate bursts suppress the enemy long enough for the casualties to be evacuated Unfortunately Sergeant Greg ran out of the ammunition knows captured While Sergeant Greg's captors took cover from incoming art American artillery Sergeant Greg grabbed the machine pistol and fought his way back to friendly lines I sometimes I'm pause because I'm thinking about these things in a little bit deeper level like Picking up a 30 caliber light machine gun, which it says light machine gun a 30 caliber machine that is not light and Just advancing on the enemy position That's just awesome and then you picture this guy we start getting hit with artillery and all the captors hide and he's like oh check You little babies Watch this grabs a machine pistol fights way back from lines The next day the Germans counter attacked L company Sorry the next day the Germans counter attacked L company was ordered to hold the line on a hill capture the day before acting as a forward observer Sergeant Greg directed over 600 rounds onto the enemy until he lost communications with the mortar section Knowing how important the mortar fire was to the defense Sergeant Greg took the initiative to find out what had happened to the phone line upon nearing the mortar section Another soldier yelled at the Germans had seized the mortar position and were dropping rounds on the Americans Sergeant Greg assaulted the Germans taking two prisoners He quickly put the mortars back into the fight by gathering up a handful of American troops and teaching them how to fire mortars OJT L company held the line Sergeant Greg's bravery initiative in situational awareness contributed to his units successful defense The defeat of the German counter attack led to the allied breakout from the beach head and the eventual capture of Rome And we'll talk about put the bait out there sends a little spy in there and says hey, there's gonna be these Marines are gonna be vulnerable to attack Hanakin spy soon returned with information of a rebel plan to attack these Marines as well as Charlemagne's Location during this attack on 31 October 1919 Sergeant Hanakin led a 22 led 22 local militiamen in an attack on Charlemagne disguised as rebels this is you know this is freaking get it disguised as rebels Hanakin and his unit move through several guard posts and boldly walked into the unsuspecting rebel camp When he was within 15 yards of you know where the story is going It's going right where you wanted to go when he was within 15 yards of Charlemagne Sergeant Hanakin drew out his pistol and shot and killed the rebel leader In the firefight that followed dude in the firefight that followed The small rating party captured the rebel position and defended it from a series of counter attacks The Marines were the target of the rebel attack had been worn by Sergeant Hanakin of the impending strike and were well prepared for the rebel attack The rebels were thoroughly defeated the morning after his act after the action Sergeant Hanakin reported his exploits to his command officer His command officer, we know what he was doing here is just out there getting after it Hanakin's actions had routed more than a thousand outlaws killed their leader in virtually shattered the entire band resistance movement in northern Haiti For his actions Sergeant Hanakin was awarded the Medal of Honor. The Americans walked right into the German machine gun command post open fire and the Germans immediately surrendered Upon hearing the fire behind them the Germans that were dug in near the command post swung their weapons around and began firing at the Americans caught in the open in a hail of automatic fire the Americans instantly took casualties Corporal York took aim at the nearest machine gun about 25 yards away and killed the man behind the gun He continued to fire at each German who popped his head out of a foxhole After watching his troops being massacred by this lone sharpshooter the German major in command yelled to York If you'll stop shooting I'll make them surrender Work on your marksmanship people work on your marksmanship Within minutes the remaining American troops had captured 90 German prisoners But they were behind enemy lines Corporal York took charge and quickly organized his platoon He decided to move back towards friendly positions straight through the German lines York ordered the German prisoners to carry back the American wounded Every time the group came upon a German position York told the captured German major to order the troops to surrender The well-disciplined German soldiers never questioned the order and by the time York's small band reached friendly lines They had acquired 132 German prisoners In their wake York's platoon left 35 deserted German machine gun positions and a significant gap in the German defenses This gap which York had created was a vital element to the success of the division's advance This advance gave momentum to the American forces and contributed to the success of the offensive phenomenal Here's the lessons Corporal York was quick to exploit the opportunity which had been created He realized that his actions would affect the outcome of the battalions advance and made decisions which supported his commanders intent His strong situation awareness guided him in taking action which had decisive results You know when you think even when I think when I think of World War one soldiers You I definitely envision someone that's much more obedient than what we have in the modern all volunteer military today The company advanced along highway one with second platoon in the lead until it became necessary to cross a bridge over the perfume river Just as the lead squad crested the center of the span An NVA machine gun in place to name fortified bunker open fire the company was pinned on the bridge and the lead squad took multiple casualties An M60 was set up to counter the NVA position, but the team leader was killed moments later as sparked flew from enemy rounds hitting the bridge structure Corporal Tully decided to take matters into his own hands Corporal Tully was second squad leader of second platoon On the bridge his squad was located directly behind the lead squad Assessing the situation corporal Tully decided upon a course of action that would allow his company to advance Realizing that his squad was protected from fire and Was the nearest to the enemy corporal Tully charged up a walkway and threw a grenade into the enemy position killing five NVA and Silencing the position the company followed corporal Tully squad Cross the bridge and advanced upon the citadel as the company neared the citadel It met heavy resistance from northern Vietnamese army regulars while forced to withdraw Gulf two-fied Gulf two-fied clarify the situation around the citadel American commanders had gained a much needed clear picture of how strong the enemy was in a way city Now the American commanders could concentrate on what to do rather than wondering what was going on That's a you know, we used to set up the the old barricade attutor down the hallway I am going to do this That's It's an interesting thing because you know sometimes leaders got to say okay, this is what's going on Here's the absolutely critical task and I'm actually just gonna go do it right now Because if it doesn't get done we're all doomed Taking off his boots That's a that's Hard thing for me to think about because my feet are soft Man, I think every time we turned on Barcelona road, you know up there at Camp Hamilton going on ranges and and training Just think about Think about you know the exploits of John Basel. it's it as you're saying that I'm thinking about You know, I'm thinking about as with the training that you ran Was you know, which was the best Freaking training in the world when you were the officer charge of trained attachment You know here for the west-go seal teams and You know your instructors were were out there to teach to teach people how hard it was going to be Particularly in the urban environment, you know in a combat situation how easily you can get in blue on blue situation How easily things to go chaotic how easily you can't actually make comes on the radio You know or the lambo or firm environment exactly same thing and distances at ridge lines in the way or whatever I'm gonna adapt and I'm gonna get across this river I'm gonna take as many of my guys with me as I can Taking on the role as the main effort of the German attack sergeant rubarth displayed outstanding leadership Shouldering the responsibility of creating a breach in the French defenses though greatly outnumbered on the far shore The squad followed their courageous and decisive leader sergeant rubarth's bravery and judgment Allowed him to succeed despite being isolated and under attack by French artillery Sergeant rubarth did not wait for reinforcements but continued to attack the enemy deciding that rapid action was necessary This is where action versus in action right action versus in action What was I saying yesterday when we were recording you have found mine I was I was like Nine times out of ten Action is better than an action. The company had been withered by repeated fights with the North Korean forces Corporal Lamb was acting platoon commander of the third-button of a unit of about 20 soldiers so we got the That freaking e4 out there acting as a platoon commander Following heavy bombardment and supporting fires corporate Lamb's platoon made a direct assault on hail 520 Upon nearing the enemy Lamb's platoon was halted by enemy fire and began taking casualties Lamb called back for reinforcements lieutenant Gano Gathered his first platoon and moved towards Lamb's position Gano's platoon began to take casualties and halted when the young lieutenant was killed Private high stepped into the role of platoon commander and rallied his platoon While under fire corporate Lamb directed the use of supporting fires and planned a new route for the enemy attack for the company attack After a bitter fight that two platoons breached the enemy defenses during the assault on the position Corporal Lamb was wounded private high was now the main effort of the attack He directed the remaining soldiers in taking out the bunkers in the enemy defenses using grenades and Flame thrillers Three hours after the attack had set off the enemy position was secured corporate Lamb's leadership had pulled its platoon and the remainder of G company forward through the withering fire in the enemy's position the attack pushed the enemy off Hill 520 and important and important step in removing resistance from heartbreak rich Here's some coats that this thing starts off with the most brilliant plan Depends for its tactical execution on the squad leaders poor squad leaders may ruin the best laid plans First rate squad leaders often save badly devised plans The squad leader is the sole level of command that maintains direct contact with the men who do the actual fighting The follow's then that the squad leader is to be trained as a tactical commander and as an educator of his men that's interesting because You know when we talk about Span of control and on the battlefield, you know you can have Four five six guys and you can pretty much Control you can per you can you can you can you can make things happen You know when you've got four five six guys Maybe seven it starts getting really wonky at eight And I was just thinking about us as we're hearing those stories It's hard to imagine that these guys how young they were you know a guy like Corporal Tomsey 21 years old It with all that you know, we just limited life experience and yet in this massive position of responsibility They're playing such key roles and in in women other teams succeed to fails and just my hats off all the squad leaders out there and What are not going to work with the guy like that and to reflect on on the impact that he had on all the Marines that he'd be led Yeah, that was um I think that's probably a pretty good place to stop for today We got some more we got some more things to cover It sort of looks like a pineapple It's got the little like spikes spikes on it's like like a like a like a like a quad pattern Oh, yeah, This is an example now is there a case where perhaps it would be Better to wait for reinforcements, but I'll tell you what here's the deal if you take action You know what we got enough guys what we're gonna push we're gonna go Maybe you get stopped maybe you meet heavy resistance now you know that now you know you actually can't proceed But if you go and you're like And you know, I think the other thing too to think about here is these other these other Realistations were looking at I mean obviously amazing illustrations of A junior leader, you know squad leader step up a bag in these calls, but You know the previous ones in world where wanted to you were talking about you know You look vicious fighting obviously people are dying and and and being You know shot and blown up or band added or whatever It wasn't even idea that you could hawk a person out of a plane with a piece of Free pizza cloth above them and they'd live And here they are just doing assaults this one they weren't parachuteing actually on ten May 1940 his parachute company Daringly landed on the top of even a male in gliders with the mission of silencing the guns of the fortress in order to allow the German army to capture bridges to the east When Sergeant Wensel landed atop the fortress he realized his commanding officer's glider had not made it to the objective This left Sergeant Wensel in command of 80 parachutists In four man teams the Germans used flame throwers and special shaped charges to attack each gun turret Sergeant Wensel commanded his unit from a captured pill box the situation became tenuous when the Belgians prevented the German Reinforcements from arriving by blowing the bridge on the main route of the ground attack the parachute Persword caught off the Belgians were also calling artillery on the Germans and enemy infantry could be seen Preparing to counter attack the pair troopers and as I was reading a self-saclates again Enemy who we talked about there's arguing about the Belgians Sergeant Wensel Continued to lead the parachutists for three more hours as each Belgian gun position was eliminated after the sun had set Sergeant Wensel linked up with German forces from the east Even a male head fallen Sergeant Wensel's actions allowed German forces approaching from the east to advance Unmoles to across the canals when a force of 80 men he had subdued 1200 of the enemy The defense of Belgium was broken and the German army was able to rapidly defeat Belgium and move into France The northern wing of the German army rapidly outfack flanked the French army and brought about a defeat the French forces in a mere six weeks For his heroic actions and outstanding leadership as Sergeant Wensel was awarded the Knights cross When you think about 80 men beating one thousand two hundred I was sitting there and I was in my mind of thinking like how do you do that Yes, I did In each case the squad leader had to make a quick decision without direct orders Act independently and accept responsibility for the results Short lessons are presented at the end of each story these lessons should help you realize how important your decisions are to your Marines and your commander In combat you must think beyond the squad level you must develop opportunities for your commander to exploit Your every action must support your commanders intent you must be competent in the combat skills required of a combined arms leader You are the primary war fighter of the Marine Corps Boom Freaking legit I think about how often like how different that is right from a culture of centralized command Where the senior leaders like we owe the frontline troops just don't get it they don't know what's good They don't understand and they would do operations all the time so it is also You know based on the particular a.o that you know that you were in I mean even when we were when we were in Ramadi the guys that were over in another city You know whatever not not that far away Some of those guys didn't didn't I don't know if they got in fire fights, so I mean they got you know two or three It's where Huck in these grenades and The chief that was running the training who it was a freaking like a bad ass team guy I'm at a fact Tony mentioned him because he he died But the same as Tim Feral and so we're throwing these grenades and when they would so if if you threw a grenade It didn't go off the protocol was shut down the range call EOD EOD can come out there whatever in five hours and you're gonna sit there for five hours waiting for them to show up So Tim Feral didn't want us to miss training so he's going out on the range He'd like be like he'd give it like whatever a few minutes and then he'd take another grenade another freaking Old rusty pineapple grenade He would go up pull the pin said it down next to the one that was the dud after he went around the report That's balls he said it down and then run back I jump into the pit and did I'm a new guy? That's all you need to do So you can maneuver a little bit I think that mentality like from a defensive perspective you know I know a clouds with it's talked about the defensive position being you know the strongest and and Your mentality is like you know you're giving the all the momentum all the initiative Yeah, by that it's weird too because you think when you got When you caught you know Captain obvious right when you catch that nickname you're gonna start maybe paying attention Right put yourself in check when you get promoted What was the next promotion after when you get promoted to Admiral obviously like all right this is definitely got to stop I got to just just bite my lip a little bit more still done still don't quite pull it off guess what once you're field marshal Okay undontered he ordered his unit to attack another bunker with grenades and a satchel charge The French soldiers inside surrendered and their white flag was replaced with German colors This drew cheers from the Germans on the far side of the river and Demoralize the French defenders sergeant Rubarth then advance and aggressively took two more bunkers Creating a mere 300 meter gap in the first line of French defenses More German forces then followed him across the river after receiving a fresh supply of ammunition and four more men Don't worry you got four more men Proceed sergeant Rubarth continued his attack and as Enemy artillery started raining down on them sergeant Rubarth moved his squad quickly so that the artillery fire could not adjust to them His squad overtook three more bunkers and broke them through the second line of enemy positions the second line of enemy positions After seeing several of their bunkers blown up the French forces assumed that they were being overrun Their spirit crushed the French began to withdraw The action became a route as the advancing German pursued Germans pursued the French forces First achievement sergeant Rubarth received a battlefield commission to lieutenant as awarded the nighthood of the iron cross When I think now thinking to that last one in this one Let's face it you got a small number of guys and you just start going ham Just start attacking and people aren't expecting you to do that Well, then we're not covered moving for each other not there to cover move for someone that needs help If I've got a culture of micro management I guess what no one's gonna have any initiative because the culture isn't what we'll sit around and wait and get told what to do So you can see how these cultures Drive bad decision making of course culture can also drive a good decision making Right with with good culture if you've got good culture if you've got a culture of ownership If everyone in your team has got the culture where hey, we take ownership. They kicked this off by talking about Corporal Alvin York United States Army All right, so I Expect that this to be all Marines, but the Marine Corps is awesome and they said hey these are awesome examples of where a squad leader made a difference and we're gonna use them France 1918 the Muse Argon offensive was the last important battle of the first World War on the night of September 1918 over one million American soldiers moved up to relieve the French forces on the front lines The American advance that ensued swept easily through the first two lines of German trenches and Then progress slowed facing stiff resistance the reserve division was called up Corporal Alvin York served as an infantry man in the 82nd division York's company started across a valley at six in the morning as they began to move the company came Under heavy fire from behind a hill enemy machine guns mode down the first wave of advancing Americans No one knew where the deadly fire was coming from so York's platoon sergeant decided to take the platoon on a mission to find it The platoon found a gap in the enemy lines and circled to the rear where they thought the machine guns might be The group of Americans stumbled across two German leader bearers whom they followed back to the headquarters of the machine gun Hey, make sure you stick with whatever you know because you're doing like a ship boarding and like hey if you don't got a radio Make sure you stick with somebody that does But now pretty much we don't need even know anything By the time we get to the teams in the 2000 we've all got radios all got radios I love that and also too like okay, so and consider this Which you this is something you don't really think about the joint warfare in the krill oil you don't go Like through the day thinking it will can't wait to take my joint warfare like it's not on your mind until it's time to take it So like moke sometimes you can be like hey, I can't kind of can't wait for them. I guess definition of surprise Because you know if if it in Gjitsu right you know you're going for an arm walk You know you're going for an arm walk We know you know I'm trying to tap you out No, no, that's actually not true If I think about it like the way there's been some things where I've seen I found out after the fact what you did to reach a level of As close as a human can get to perfection on something where I've been like I didn't expect him to do all that but he did it so that implied level of Perfection just from my own stupid personality is like enough to make someone tell you I better get this right before you know we go forward and that sucks and and I talked about it at Gettysburg You're gonna be with what you're gonna be with whatever 22 other guys That's what you're gonna be you who knows where your commander is gonna be you're freaking flying in the dark where you're jumping out of an airplane How what's your grouping how many people you're gonna be close to so But if you haven't trained and Been been for lack of a better word programed that when you hear a call you're gonna execute There's often times when the execution doesn't happen The reason I'm bringing this up is because I was thinking about this because the every one of these things the common thing is that somebody's taking action It's not someone's making a decision they're making a decision too, but they have to act and even when Dave talks about the Udalupe You know, he He says that the most important part of the Udalupe is action It's action you've got it you've got to take action if you don't take action look you can or observe oriented decide all day long If you don't act It doesn't matter and same thing with relax look around and make a call You're telling me that I could get people to go over there and they look at me kind of tilt the head And say I'm gonna get trouble if I do that I can't do that actually no one is doing anything right now I just walked by your Platoon commander and he was sitting there talking to your task unit commander about spigetti for dinner because They have no idea what's happening and if you don't make something happen no one's gonna be Anything tonight could do this over and over again Well, but you would ask the question like hey, do you think your task?
