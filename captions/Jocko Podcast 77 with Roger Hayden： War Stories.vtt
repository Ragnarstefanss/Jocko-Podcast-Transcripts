00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.80
This is Jockel Podcast, number 77.

3
00:00:11.80 --> 00:00:14.08
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

4
00:00:14.08 --> 00:00:16.08
Good evening, echo.

5
00:00:16.08 --> 00:00:17.08
Good evening.

6
00:00:17.08 --> 00:00:22.88
And tonight we welcome back to the show, retired chief worn off Sir Roger Hayden.

7
00:00:22.88 --> 00:00:29.20
And if you don't know who Roger Hayden is, then just stop right now and go back to episode 37 of

8
00:00:29.20 --> 00:00:31.28
this podcast.

9
00:00:31.28 --> 00:00:34.16
And you can listen to Roger came on for a short period of time.

10
00:00:34.16 --> 00:00:37.80
We had some time constraints on the first time that Roger came on.

11
00:00:37.80 --> 00:00:42.84
But he's one of the men on which the reputation of the seal teams is built, started off

12
00:00:42.84 --> 00:00:50.08
as a frogman member of the underwater demolition teams and deployed to Vietnam with underwater

13
00:00:50.08 --> 00:00:52.56
demolition team 12.

14
00:00:52.56 --> 00:00:58.16
And then came back and checked into seal team one where he deployed again two times to

15
00:00:58.16 --> 00:00:59.48
Vietnam.

16
00:00:59.48 --> 00:01:08.20
And then spent 30 years in the seal teams and then as a civilian has another how many years.

17
00:01:08.20 --> 00:01:09.20
20.

18
00:01:09.20 --> 00:01:15.24
So we're just looking at a solid 50 years of service to Naval Special Warfare in the

19
00:01:15.24 --> 00:01:16.24
seal teams.

20
00:01:16.24 --> 00:01:21.28
So like I said, Roger's been on before and I'm telling one real quick story to kind

21
00:01:21.28 --> 00:01:27.08
of give a little background as to Roger's attitude about things.

22
00:01:27.08 --> 00:01:30.88
And so I was on and I told this part of the story last time we were on a ship.

23
00:01:30.88 --> 00:01:36.92
We were we were having our operational readiness exercise was being graded.

24
00:01:36.92 --> 00:01:40.24
It's called an ORE and the first one that's grading it is Roger Hayden.

25
00:01:40.24 --> 00:01:45.40
So you know the young seal potoons we're getting graded and making sure that we know

26
00:01:45.40 --> 00:01:46.96
what we're doing.

27
00:01:46.96 --> 00:01:49.96
And at this point Roger is a war officer.

28
00:01:49.96 --> 00:01:54.08
So he's a commissioned officer and he's out on the ship with us going, you know, watching

29
00:01:54.08 --> 00:01:57.76
how we're planning and seeing how we're preparing our gear and making sure that we're

30
00:01:57.76 --> 00:01:58.76
we know what we're doing.

31
00:01:58.76 --> 00:02:05.24
Like I said, and as a commissioned officer, you're supposed to be eating in what's

32
00:02:05.24 --> 00:02:08.56
called the war groom with the rest of the officers.

33
00:02:08.56 --> 00:02:12.68
So you know the military has officers and they have enlisted guys in the officers are

34
00:02:12.68 --> 00:02:17.36
sort of the managers and the enlisted guys are the workers.

35
00:02:17.36 --> 00:02:21.56
And as an officer on a ship on a Navy ship, you have something called a war groom, which

36
00:02:21.56 --> 00:02:23.04
is nice to have.

37
00:02:23.04 --> 00:02:25.32
It's just a little, it's not even a little level up.

38
00:02:25.32 --> 00:02:26.84
It's pretty darn nice in the war groom.

39
00:02:26.84 --> 00:02:30.68
I've eaten in both the war groom and on the mass decks and the war groom, you know, you

40
00:02:30.68 --> 00:02:33.44
have real silver and there's actually people serving you.

41
00:02:33.44 --> 00:02:35.44
So the war groom is kind of nice.

42
00:02:35.44 --> 00:02:41.64
Well Roger as a war officer is, you know, permitted or authorized or supposed to eat with

43
00:02:41.64 --> 00:02:42.64
the rest of the officers.

44
00:02:42.64 --> 00:02:49.12
He's supposed to go get that good treatment and Roger didn't want to eat with the officers.

45
00:02:49.12 --> 00:02:50.28
He wanted to eat with the chief.

46
00:02:50.28 --> 00:02:56.32
So then the middle management of the of the Navy is the chief, the chief pedda officers.

47
00:02:56.32 --> 00:02:59.24
And there's chiefs senior chiefs and master chiefs.

48
00:02:59.24 --> 00:03:01.24
And they're like the backbone of the Navy.

49
00:03:01.24 --> 00:03:07.000
They have the the tactical knowledge and the seal teams and so Roger instead of wanting

50
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.92
instead of eating with the officers, he wanted to eat with the chiefs.

51
00:03:10.92 --> 00:03:13.92
And before he was a war officer, what were you a senior chief before you were an officer

52
00:03:13.92 --> 00:03:14.92
master chief?

53
00:03:14.92 --> 00:03:15.92
Master chief.

54
00:03:15.92 --> 00:03:20.20
So he was a heart-bitty of master chief before he became a war officer.

55
00:03:20.20 --> 00:03:24.52
And so he started eating the chiefs mess with all the chiefs.

56
00:03:24.52 --> 00:03:32.000
Well, some of the chiefs on the ship, they didn't like having an officer.

57
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.36
You know, we don't want this officer here.

58
00:03:33.36 --> 00:03:34.92
This is our territory, right?

59
00:03:34.92 --> 00:03:35.92
This is our area.

60
00:03:35.92 --> 00:03:40.000
You can't, you know, why is this officer coming in here?

61
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.92
And so my platoon chief at the time was actually friends with Roger, but you know, he

62
00:03:46.92 --> 00:03:50.72
was the guy that was getting a had-related building relationships with the chiefs on the ship

63
00:03:50.72 --> 00:03:53.16
and all that stuff and so they knew him.

64
00:03:53.16 --> 00:03:58.84
And he was a senior chief and they pulled them aside, they said, hey, you know, hey, a senior

65
00:03:58.84 --> 00:03:59.84
chief.

66
00:03:59.84 --> 00:04:01.12
You know, it's kind of, we got this war officer.

67
00:04:01.12 --> 00:04:02.28
He's the seal, why is he coming in?

68
00:04:02.28 --> 00:04:03.28
He's not shouldn't be coming in.

69
00:04:03.28 --> 00:04:07.68
Here's you need to go to the, he needs to go to the war drum with the rest of the officers.

70
00:04:07.68 --> 00:04:08.68
This is the chiefs mess.

71
00:04:08.68 --> 00:04:10.24
He doesn't belong in here.

72
00:04:10.24 --> 00:04:11.96
And so my chief was like, listen to him.

73
00:04:11.96 --> 00:04:12.96
Okay.

74
00:04:12.96 --> 00:04:14.92
Well, I'm not sure why you feel that way.

75
00:04:14.92 --> 00:04:20.52
But this goes on for a couple days and finally my platoon chief and I wasn't there for this,

76
00:04:20.52 --> 00:04:22.84
but I got told the story.

77
00:04:22.84 --> 00:04:28.64
And my platoon chief was a guy from the south and he had a great accident and talked in a very

78
00:04:28.64 --> 00:04:30.44
distinct manner.

79
00:04:30.44 --> 00:04:33.12
And so they get into lunch.

80
00:04:33.12 --> 00:04:34.12
I think it was lunch.

81
00:04:34.12 --> 00:04:39.36
They roll into the chiefs mess for lunch and war officer Hayden comes in and he's standing

82
00:04:39.36 --> 00:04:43.52
in there and he's getting a couple of looks from people.

83
00:04:43.52 --> 00:04:51.04
And finally my platoon chief stands up and says, uh, can I ask everyone in here a question?

84
00:04:51.04 --> 00:04:52.84
Real quick.

85
00:04:52.84 --> 00:04:55.36
And they go, okay, you know what, what?

86
00:04:55.36 --> 00:05:03.84
And he says, well, this here is war officer, Roger Hayden, member of the underwater

87
00:05:03.84 --> 00:05:10.32
demolition team is member of the seal team serve three tours in Vietnam, highly decorated,

88
00:05:10.32 --> 00:05:16.76
including a purple heart for being wounded and he was a master chief before he got commissioned

89
00:05:16.76 --> 00:05:22.24
and he wants to eat with us in the chiefs mess.

90
00:05:22.24 --> 00:05:26.84
Does anyone here have a problem with that?

91
00:05:26.84 --> 00:05:28.96
That of course no one did.

92
00:05:28.96 --> 00:05:30.68
Nothing but crickets.

93
00:05:30.68 --> 00:05:34.96
And so Roger Hayden eats where Roger Hayden wants to eat.

94
00:05:34.96 --> 00:05:38.08
So Roger, welcome to show once again.

95
00:05:38.08 --> 00:05:39.08
Thanks for coming back.

96
00:05:39.08 --> 00:05:42.44
Last time we were time constraint and you said you'd come back.

97
00:05:42.44 --> 00:05:43.44
So here you are.

98
00:05:43.44 --> 00:05:44.44
I appreciate you coming back on.

99
00:05:44.44 --> 00:05:45.68
Oh, it's my pleasure.

100
00:05:45.68 --> 00:05:46.68
Thank you.

101
00:05:46.68 --> 00:05:52.16
And like I said, anybody that wants to get the full background, you know, listen to podcast

102
00:05:52.16 --> 00:05:55.04
number 37 and he talks a little bit about how you grew up.

103
00:05:55.04 --> 00:05:56.68
But I had a question when you joined.

104
00:05:56.68 --> 00:06:01.16
So you came in and your dad was a UDT, which is awesome.

105
00:06:01.16 --> 00:06:07.08
And then when you joined the Navy in 1965, did you know you were going to Vietnam

106
00:06:07.08 --> 00:06:11.04
was the war big enough yet because we had this guy on last time Captain Charlie Plum and

107
00:06:11.04 --> 00:06:16.32
he went to the Naval Academy and he said he graduated from the Naval Academy.

108
00:06:16.32 --> 00:06:19.36
I think in 1965 as well.

109
00:06:19.36 --> 00:06:25.20
But he said he never heard the word Vietnam one time while he was going to the Naval

110
00:06:25.20 --> 00:06:26.20
Academy.

111
00:06:26.20 --> 00:06:29.72
It wasn't until he graduated that the war escalated and all of a sudden they realized

112
00:06:29.72 --> 00:06:33.000
when he was going through flight training that yeah, you're going to Vietnam.

113
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
But when you joined in 65, did you know, I mean, when you think in the album, definitely

114
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.52
going to go to a war go to Vietnam?

115
00:06:37.52 --> 00:06:42.64
Yeah, pretty much because I'd have been drafted in the Army and I knew the Army was going

116
00:06:42.64 --> 00:06:43.64
to Vietnam.

117
00:06:43.64 --> 00:06:49.68
So I figured, and you I wanted to go in the Navy and into UDT.

118
00:06:49.68 --> 00:06:51.44
My dad never talked about it much.

119
00:06:51.44 --> 00:07:00.08
But you know, when I was a younger, I watched the movies of the Marines attacking beachheads

120
00:07:00.08 --> 00:07:04.84
and getting molded down and, you know, Rangers taking heavy stuff and then I saw the bridge

121
00:07:04.84 --> 00:07:07.08
of the river crying the guns and never owned.

122
00:07:07.08 --> 00:07:10.32
And I figured, yeah, if you're going to fight, that's the kind of outfit you want to

123
00:07:10.32 --> 00:07:11.32
fight.

124
00:07:11.32 --> 00:07:12.32
I want to sneak around a little bit more.

125
00:07:12.32 --> 00:07:13.32
So yeah, I did.

126
00:07:13.32 --> 00:07:14.32
I did.

127
00:07:14.32 --> 00:07:20.40
In fact, as soon as I got in to the Navy, I took the screening test and all that stuff.

128
00:07:20.40 --> 00:07:27.24
And, you know, before I even went to, no right after when I was at radio in school, I was

129
00:07:27.24 --> 00:07:28.24
a radioman.

130
00:07:28.24 --> 00:07:31.20
So through it, that was a 22 week long school.

131
00:07:31.20 --> 00:07:37.000
That's what I did as I worked and did all that stuff and did the screen tests and, you

132
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.48
know, they wanted me to go to Roller or some other Navy installation because they didn't

133
00:07:43.48 --> 00:07:44.96
do two bad radioman's guy.

134
00:07:44.96 --> 00:07:48.96
I wasn't the number one guy, but now I'm going to go to UDT.

135
00:07:48.96 --> 00:07:52.20
And so, you went to what the U.S.

136
00:07:52.20 --> 00:07:57.76
Well, yeah, we, our class, our class wasn't certain up for about six months.

137
00:07:57.76 --> 00:08:04.88
So they stuck me on the U.S. as Paul Revere, a 32nd Street waiting for UDT training.

138
00:08:04.88 --> 00:08:07.12
And I was a designated semen back in the day.

139
00:08:07.12 --> 00:08:09.36
A designated semen was pretty good.

140
00:08:09.36 --> 00:08:11.28
Wasn't like it is now.

141
00:08:11.28 --> 00:08:15.28
And I figured I'd work in the radio shakers, I'm like that.

142
00:08:15.28 --> 00:08:18.76
Well, since they checked the board, they put me in the medscook and I was down in the

143
00:08:18.76 --> 00:08:20.52
scullery and went down there.

144
00:08:20.52 --> 00:08:24.52
There were two other guys that were waiting for a 22 that were in the scullery.

145
00:08:24.52 --> 00:08:31.20
So we sat there and did that for six months and cut off the ship and went next door

146
00:08:31.20 --> 00:08:32.76
across the bay there to training.

147
00:08:32.76 --> 00:08:34.36
Yeah, that's something in the Navy.

148
00:08:34.36 --> 00:08:38.04
It's, if you're a new guy, everyone talks about how new guys get treated wherever you are

149
00:08:38.04 --> 00:08:43.68
in the military, but in the Navy, when you, when you show up to a ship, you doesn't matter.

150
00:08:43.68 --> 00:08:47.28
You have to work in the, in the scullery, which is Washington, dishes.

151
00:08:47.28 --> 00:08:48.28
What is it?

152
00:08:48.28 --> 00:08:49.28
A 90 day stint you got to do in there?

153
00:08:49.28 --> 00:08:51.52
Yeah, pretty much 90 days.

154
00:08:51.52 --> 00:08:56.44
And you only don't do that if you're an e-phone above.

155
00:08:56.44 --> 00:08:57.44
Right.

156
00:08:57.44 --> 00:09:01.76
And we did, I did a appointment when we had a guy that wasn't E.A.C.O, but he was an E3.

157
00:09:01.76 --> 00:09:06.96
And you know, he was saying, hey, wait, how am I going to get out of this, you know,

158
00:09:06.96 --> 00:09:08.24
doing the scullery duty?

159
00:09:08.24 --> 00:09:10.16
And we're like, you're not.

160
00:09:10.16 --> 00:09:11.16
That's the rules.

161
00:09:11.16 --> 00:09:12.56
You know, you're going to go do it.

162
00:09:12.56 --> 00:09:13.56
You can do it.

163
00:09:13.56 --> 00:09:18.28
I was a senior chief to of this guy named Little Good for the mind.

164
00:09:18.28 --> 00:09:23.68
We couldn't get a flight back so they put us on an arc to float back here to San Diego.

165
00:09:23.68 --> 00:09:25.32
And we kept all of our guys.

166
00:09:25.32 --> 00:09:28.04
And the, I'm going to ask you a thing that we're seeing.

167
00:09:28.04 --> 00:09:31.000
That's because we just went, we got stuff to do.

168
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.32
We're doing training and they haven't got time to do that.

169
00:09:34.32 --> 00:09:36.92
We kept out of, of course, I was a senior chief then.

170
00:09:36.92 --> 00:09:39.20
And so we had Little Paul.

171
00:09:39.20 --> 00:09:40.20
Yeah.

172
00:09:40.20 --> 00:09:42.56
Plus, the cover, the boat, he really liked us a lot.

173
00:09:42.56 --> 00:09:44.72
And, you know, the, the CMC.

174
00:09:44.72 --> 00:09:47.96
And he was a PBR Vietnam guy.

175
00:09:47.96 --> 00:09:49.96
So we were really, really well, you know.

176
00:09:49.96 --> 00:09:50.96
Yeah.

177
00:09:50.96 --> 00:09:54.04
Well, and actually this kid ended up making E4, luckily before we went on the

178
00:09:54.04 --> 00:09:55.04
deployment.

179
00:09:55.04 --> 00:09:56.04
So he's screwed out there.

180
00:09:56.04 --> 00:10:00.84
But I believe still did, bringing the supplies and stuff like that.

181
00:10:00.84 --> 00:10:02.40
You know, it doesn't, it was a good workout.

182
00:10:02.40 --> 00:10:03.40
Yeah.

183
00:10:03.40 --> 00:10:05.000
Yeah, I figured with the call that and rep.

184
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I'd wrap it.

185
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Yeah.

186
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
We did that too.

187
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.20
Actually, when I, so my first deployment, I deployed to Guam.

188
00:10:11.20 --> 00:10:12.76
And, you know, we just did whatever he wanted.

189
00:10:12.76 --> 00:10:13.76
I was 21 years old.

190
00:10:13.76 --> 00:10:15.24
It was completely insane.

191
00:10:15.24 --> 00:10:16.88
You got all this perdiam money.

192
00:10:16.88 --> 00:10:21.000
You felt like the richest, you will never mind felt like you were the richest guy you ever met.

193
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.04
I mean, you never made any money when you're in 16, 17 years old.

194
00:10:25.04 --> 00:10:26.68
You get in the sealed teams, you're getting all this money.

195
00:10:26.68 --> 00:10:29.80
And then they go overseas and they're giving you perdiam.

196
00:10:29.80 --> 00:10:31.28
And so you're the richest dude in the world.

197
00:10:31.28 --> 00:10:34.72
You have very limited responsibilities because you're a new guy in a sealed putin.

198
00:10:34.72 --> 00:10:35.72
So what do you do?

199
00:10:35.72 --> 00:10:38.68
Just get crazy and get after it.

200
00:10:38.68 --> 00:10:40.76
And, you know, you're doing whatever you want.

201
00:10:40.76 --> 00:10:42.80
And then my next deployment was on a ship.

202
00:10:42.80 --> 00:10:44.84
And we pull into the first port.

203
00:10:44.84 --> 00:10:50.72
And they say, you know, e-form below liberty expires at 10 o'clock.

204
00:10:50.72 --> 00:10:51.72
And I was like, oh, yeah, whatever.

205
00:10:51.72 --> 00:10:52.72
You know, I'm a seal.

206
00:10:52.72 --> 00:10:55.36
And they're like, no, actually you'll be back on the ship at 10 o'clock.

207
00:10:55.36 --> 00:10:57.16
And there was no way around it.

208
00:10:57.16 --> 00:10:59.28
I mean, there was ways around it.

209
00:10:59.28 --> 00:11:00.28
We found ways around.

210
00:11:00.28 --> 00:11:01.96
You know what the way around it was?

211
00:11:01.96 --> 00:11:05.36
I'd put my PT gear in a backpack.

212
00:11:05.36 --> 00:11:10.16
And then go off the ship to go out whatever.

213
00:11:10.16 --> 00:11:13.92
And then hang out all night until five o'clock in the morning.

214
00:11:13.92 --> 00:11:15.24
And I put my PT gear back on.

215
00:11:15.24 --> 00:11:17.12
I'd run, get a sweat going to walk up the brow.

216
00:11:17.12 --> 00:11:20.48
And whatever else coming back and say, yeah, I was just out for run.

217
00:11:20.48 --> 00:11:22.56
Got my rock on.

218
00:11:22.56 --> 00:11:23.56
So there was ways.

219
00:11:23.56 --> 00:11:25.20
There's ways to make it happen.

220
00:11:25.20 --> 00:11:33.88
So speaking of guys from from when you were going through training, was there guys when

221
00:11:33.88 --> 00:11:35.08
you're going through bud training?

222
00:11:35.08 --> 00:11:37.92
Was there Korean vet, UDT guys in there?

223
00:11:37.92 --> 00:11:39.08
Was it World War II?

224
00:11:39.08 --> 00:11:40.28
Was it just Vietnam guys?

225
00:11:40.28 --> 00:11:41.28
Or even Vietnam guys?

226
00:11:41.28 --> 00:11:42.28
Or even the instructors?

227
00:11:42.28 --> 00:11:43.28
Yeah.

228
00:11:43.28 --> 00:11:48.88
Or two guys was one guy named God Demont.

229
00:11:48.88 --> 00:11:53.80
Great big tall guy, Koo Kut.

230
00:11:53.80 --> 00:11:55.76
And he was a World War II UDT guy.

231
00:11:55.76 --> 00:11:57.60
Well, let me tell you the story on that guy.

232
00:11:57.60 --> 00:12:02.24
So we just get the same community the last part of the training.

233
00:12:02.24 --> 00:12:04.56
Third phase.

234
00:12:04.56 --> 00:12:05.76
So we're all lined up there.

235
00:12:05.76 --> 00:12:06.76
We just got off.

236
00:12:06.76 --> 00:12:10.56
We went out there and then I'll see you with all of our demo and demo and all that

237
00:12:10.56 --> 00:12:11.56
of the crap.

238
00:12:11.56 --> 00:12:14.84
This mustered out there and this guy comes walking up.

239
00:12:14.84 --> 00:12:16.84
Great big tall guy, World War II.

240
00:12:16.84 --> 00:12:19.20
What was I in 1918?

241
00:12:19.20 --> 00:12:20.36
You know what I mean?

242
00:12:20.36 --> 00:12:24.88
He looked probably like you do or I do because he was an old guy in the sky.

243
00:12:24.88 --> 00:12:25.88
Yeah.

244
00:12:25.88 --> 00:12:27.52
He looks at us and he starts talking.

245
00:12:27.52 --> 00:12:29.56
You know, he goes, God Dammit.

246
00:12:29.56 --> 00:12:32.56
I'm your demo instructor and keeps talking.

247
00:12:32.56 --> 00:12:35.32
He says, I don't brook no bullshit on the ranges.

248
00:12:35.32 --> 00:12:39.40
We're kind of just looking at him like what the hell he gets himself worked up a little

249
00:12:39.40 --> 00:12:40.40
bit.

250
00:12:40.40 --> 00:12:45.40
So matter of fact, anybody that screws up would just go out behind the shitter and get

251
00:12:45.40 --> 00:12:46.40
it squirt away.

252
00:12:46.40 --> 00:12:48.16
You know, we're still looking at him.

253
00:12:48.16 --> 00:12:51.68
He talks a little bit more and gets himself all excited and shitting.

254
00:12:51.68 --> 00:12:56.80
He goes matter of fact, anybody wants to go out behind the shitter right now will go.

255
00:12:56.80 --> 00:13:01.16
You know, we just look at, well, come to find out later on.

256
00:13:01.16 --> 00:13:04.52
It was in the 80 second airborne and jumped in the Norman D'Hog.

257
00:13:04.52 --> 00:13:07.40
God capsured, escaped on and on.

258
00:13:07.40 --> 00:13:08.88
Then he was in the Korean War II.

259
00:13:08.88 --> 00:13:10.56
It was one of our instructors.

260
00:13:10.56 --> 00:13:13.24
Almost all of them there were in the Korean War pretty much.

261
00:13:13.24 --> 00:13:16.80
But we had another guy.

262
00:13:16.80 --> 00:13:22.80
And on his Jackity War, he had UDT instructor and the other side was God.

263
00:13:22.80 --> 00:13:28.52
He was, he was a hook nose, Indian Apache and he was a bad astute man.

264
00:13:28.52 --> 00:13:30.64
He had some great guys.

265
00:13:30.64 --> 00:13:35.000
And mostly instructors, yeah, were in summer, Vietnam guys.

266
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.40
You know, like, had this one blue eyed guy.

267
00:13:38.40 --> 00:13:43.08
He was, can't think of his name right now either.

268
00:13:43.08 --> 00:13:53.04
But he was on vacation with Patlin up north and in the Columbia River.

269
00:13:53.04 --> 00:13:54.04
No, not that north.

270
00:13:54.04 --> 00:13:55.04
The East Coast side.

271
00:13:55.04 --> 00:13:59.64
And his, he was on an excursion with some other people and his canoeed

272
00:13:59.64 --> 00:14:00.64
tipped over.

273
00:14:00.64 --> 00:14:03.84
And he was real cold and shit.

274
00:14:03.84 --> 00:14:07.68
He was trying to swim a couple of them to shore and shit and just just went out.

275
00:14:07.68 --> 00:14:10.36
But this guy would run behind you.

276
00:14:10.36 --> 00:14:12.40
And of course, we didn't have a lot of hair.

277
00:14:12.40 --> 00:14:14.88
But what we had stood up, you know, and you turned and looked.

278
00:14:14.88 --> 00:14:16.32
And there were he was just staring at the chat.

279
00:14:16.32 --> 00:14:17.32
These blue eyes.

280
00:14:17.32 --> 00:14:19.40
You know, I'll think of his name in a minute.

281
00:14:19.40 --> 00:14:20.40
Real good guy though.

282
00:14:20.40 --> 00:14:24.44
And there must have been, because God is pretty regimented now.

283
00:14:24.44 --> 00:14:28.12
But they must have had no, it was definitely less regimented when I went through for

284
00:14:28.12 --> 00:14:34.28
sure it must have been completely just like no rules when you went through.

285
00:14:34.28 --> 00:14:37.80
Now, we have this guy during hell week.

286
00:14:37.80 --> 00:14:40.36
He had what they called the swimmer line.

287
00:14:40.36 --> 00:14:42.36
And like I say, we're on the base side.

288
00:14:42.36 --> 00:14:44.44
Mind you, we're in training in January.

289
00:14:44.44 --> 00:14:48.36
Started three January, some colder than God.

290
00:14:48.36 --> 00:14:52.92
You know, what he would do is we're all, he'd have us hook into what we called the

291
00:14:52.92 --> 00:14:54.64
Floor Board line.

292
00:14:54.64 --> 00:14:58.08
You know, like when you do recons, the guys hold on the line, you move down the line.

293
00:14:58.08 --> 00:14:59.08
And stuff.

294
00:14:59.08 --> 00:15:01.28
And he'd send us all out.

295
00:15:01.28 --> 00:15:05.08
And hell, there's about six of us.

296
00:15:05.08 --> 00:15:07.08
That's about six of us.

297
00:15:07.08 --> 00:15:08.08
That's about six of us.

298
00:15:08.08 --> 00:15:09.08
That's about six of us.

299
00:15:09.08 --> 00:15:12.08
He'd send us out and we had to be in a straight line.

300
00:15:12.08 --> 00:15:15.68
If we weren't, he'd bring us all back and line us all up again.

301
00:15:15.68 --> 00:15:17.68
And we weren't straight.

302
00:15:17.68 --> 00:15:20.68
So he sent us out again brought us all back in.

303
00:15:20.68 --> 00:15:21.68
And we're freezing.

304
00:15:21.68 --> 00:15:23.48
The guys are almost getting hyper-thromia.

305
00:15:23.48 --> 00:15:30.96
Because we're just in a K-pop and a regular utilities that you were for training.

306
00:15:30.96 --> 00:15:33.72
So he sent us out again the third time.

307
00:15:33.72 --> 00:15:37.24
And like if you're on the bitter end line, you're screwed.

308
00:15:37.24 --> 00:15:38.24
Then he brought us back in.

309
00:15:38.24 --> 00:15:42.80
He goes, well God damn, I guess it still wasn't very, you guys still weren't in a straight

310
00:15:42.80 --> 00:15:43.80
line.

311
00:15:43.80 --> 00:15:45.64
And we're going to have to send you out again.

312
00:15:45.64 --> 00:15:46.64
All the way down the line.

313
00:15:46.64 --> 00:15:49.60
All you heard was click, click, click, click, click, click.

314
00:15:49.60 --> 00:15:51.60
We just looked at him.

315
00:15:51.60 --> 00:15:57.52
Well, all right, we got other things to do.

316
00:15:57.52 --> 00:15:58.52
That was it.

317
00:15:58.52 --> 00:15:59.52
We were done.

318
00:15:59.52 --> 00:16:03.96
And if he'd get lost a whole class, that was so cold.

319
00:16:03.96 --> 00:16:09.72
Yeah, if you don't know California and you think California is like, they watched the old

320
00:16:09.72 --> 00:16:11.52
TV show and you think the water's all warm.

321
00:16:11.52 --> 00:16:12.52
It's not warm.

322
00:16:12.52 --> 00:16:13.52
It's not warm.

323
00:16:13.52 --> 00:16:14.52
Especially in January.

324
00:16:14.52 --> 00:16:17.84
January 3rd, it's not going to be warm.

325
00:16:17.84 --> 00:16:21.12
And you were saying, you guys were swimming like crazy going through that.

326
00:16:21.12 --> 00:16:22.76
Because you knew that you're home to UDT.

327
00:16:22.76 --> 00:16:25.04
Yeah, it's a, you're a frogman.

328
00:16:25.04 --> 00:16:27.76
That's what you're being trained for and not seals.

329
00:16:27.76 --> 00:16:31.36
So we did a lot more water work than you guys did going through.

330
00:16:31.36 --> 00:16:34.40
But because we didn't have the seal portion of it.

331
00:16:34.40 --> 00:16:38.40
We got that after we made our deployment, came back when seal team then you went to

332
00:16:38.40 --> 00:16:39.40
a Cadray.

333
00:16:39.40 --> 00:16:42.40
Did you get any land warfare at all?

334
00:16:42.40 --> 00:16:45.64
And bugs are a little bit, it was just more like, yeah, basic stuff.

335
00:16:45.64 --> 00:16:49.32
And little immediate IEDs, been immediate action drills.

336
00:16:49.32 --> 00:16:52.16
But not much, it was like our last stop that we had.

337
00:16:52.16 --> 00:16:58.88
I think I told you this in on San Camini was we did swimmer scouts in on the other side

338
00:16:58.88 --> 00:17:01.40
of a rock formation.

339
00:17:01.40 --> 00:17:03.52
We called Birchit Rock and got the island.

340
00:17:03.52 --> 00:17:07.24
They gave us all the 40 pound hafer sex.

341
00:17:07.24 --> 00:17:11.80
And we went from there all the way 23 miles into the island.

342
00:17:11.80 --> 00:17:12.80
We blew up some more.

343
00:17:12.80 --> 00:17:13.80
You were walking?

344
00:17:13.80 --> 00:17:14.80
Yeah.

345
00:17:14.80 --> 00:17:15.80
Okay.

346
00:17:15.80 --> 00:17:17.08
So you humped 23 miles out and you swam over the beach.

347
00:17:17.08 --> 00:17:18.08
Yeah.

348
00:17:18.08 --> 00:17:21.08
Back in the attack the camp that was our last stop.

349
00:17:21.08 --> 00:17:24.68
That's a crappy patrol too.

350
00:17:24.68 --> 00:17:25.68
That was a cactus.

351
00:17:25.68 --> 00:17:26.68
I know.

352
00:17:26.68 --> 00:17:31.04
Yeah, that was, I was thought I was pretty smart.

353
00:17:31.04 --> 00:17:35.12
See, so I wore a kind of a wetsuit.

354
00:17:35.12 --> 00:17:36.72
What do you call that the small one?

355
00:17:36.72 --> 00:17:37.72
Oh, like a wetsuit.

356
00:17:37.72 --> 00:17:38.72
The top of your ear.

357
00:17:38.72 --> 00:17:39.72
The top of your ear.

358
00:17:39.72 --> 00:17:42.28
And because I wouldn't freeze the death coming in.

359
00:17:42.28 --> 00:17:46.72
Actually, this was April almost the end of April.

360
00:17:46.72 --> 00:17:48.60
It was still cold out of the same committee.

361
00:17:48.60 --> 00:17:50.24
So we swam in.

362
00:17:50.24 --> 00:17:52.76
And I come to that thing on all the way up there.

363
00:17:52.76 --> 00:17:54.48
And it got sunny and warm.

364
00:17:54.48 --> 00:17:55.96
And I almost frigging died.

365
00:17:55.96 --> 00:17:56.96
There's no back.

366
00:17:56.96 --> 00:17:59.08
You could peel it off me like this.

367
00:17:59.08 --> 00:18:00.08
You know, yeah.

368
00:18:00.08 --> 00:18:01.08
There's no good.

369
00:18:01.08 --> 00:18:02.76
There's no good way to do it.

370
00:18:02.76 --> 00:18:05.20
There's like no good way to handle coming over the beach.

371
00:18:05.20 --> 00:18:06.68
So it's not going to be convenient.

372
00:18:06.68 --> 00:18:08.08
You're not going to be comfortable.

373
00:18:08.08 --> 00:18:12.20
That's one of the things that makes, in my opinion, the one of the things that makes the

374
00:18:12.20 --> 00:18:15.76
seal team, the guy's in the seal team is really good is that we just have to deal with

375
00:18:15.76 --> 00:18:16.60
the water.

376
00:18:16.60 --> 00:18:19.60
And as soon as you're dealing with the water, like you just said, there's no easy way to

377
00:18:19.60 --> 00:18:20.60
do that.

378
00:18:20.60 --> 00:18:23.60
You're going to be there be freezing in the water or you're going to be sweating on land

379
00:18:23.60 --> 00:18:25.84
or you're going to be too hot.

380
00:18:25.84 --> 00:18:27.56
No, actually, you're not.

381
00:18:27.56 --> 00:18:30.08
You're going to be okay on the land.

382
00:18:30.08 --> 00:18:31.56
It's just, you're just screwed.

383
00:18:31.56 --> 00:18:33.16
It's what I'm saying.

384
00:18:33.16 --> 00:18:34.68
And not to mention your weapons.

385
00:18:34.68 --> 00:18:36.84
Your weapons all get your radio is all get jacked up.

386
00:18:36.84 --> 00:18:38.56
Your weapons all get jacked up.

387
00:18:38.56 --> 00:18:39.68
Your gear gets all jacked up.

388
00:18:39.68 --> 00:18:41.16
You got sand in your boots.

389
00:18:41.16 --> 00:18:43.16
There's no good way to deal with it.

390
00:18:43.16 --> 00:18:44.16
No, there's no.

391
00:18:44.16 --> 00:18:46.04
And on top of that, the communications.

392
00:18:46.04 --> 00:18:48.28
Like you're in the water, you can't talk to people.

393
00:18:48.28 --> 00:18:49.28
You can't.

394
00:18:49.28 --> 00:18:50.28
There's no really radio.

395
00:18:50.28 --> 00:18:51.28
It's not working.

396
00:18:51.28 --> 00:18:52.28
It just everything sucks.

397
00:18:52.28 --> 00:18:56.92
And so when we were do ops dry, it just seems like it's so easy to do.

398
00:18:56.92 --> 00:19:00.28
And I think that's one big thing that separates, it doesn't separate us.

399
00:19:00.28 --> 00:19:03.16
But it's one of the things that makes us good is that we have to deal with the water.

400
00:19:03.16 --> 00:19:04.16
And we deal with our whole crew.

401
00:19:04.16 --> 00:19:07.12
No bottom line is you should never bring a boat to shore.

402
00:19:07.12 --> 00:19:08.12
You always swim in.

403
00:19:08.12 --> 00:19:09.12
Yep.

404
00:19:09.12 --> 00:19:10.12
That's what we do.

405
00:19:10.12 --> 00:19:12.12
Just like swim rescuers, the home and yard.

406
00:19:12.12 --> 00:19:13.96
That's the bottom line was a chief.

407
00:19:13.96 --> 00:19:15.60
That's pretty hard on that stuff.

408
00:19:15.60 --> 00:19:17.84
We never brought the boats of shore.

409
00:19:17.84 --> 00:19:18.84
Yeah.

410
00:19:18.84 --> 00:19:22.24
You know, we did the same thing when we were in the art platoon.

411
00:19:22.24 --> 00:19:27.48
We never brought the boats in because there's a 10, 15, maybe 20% chance that you're

412
00:19:27.48 --> 00:19:29.20
going to flip a boat, you're going to lose a boat.

413
00:19:29.20 --> 00:19:30.20
Something's going to happen to a boat.

414
00:19:30.20 --> 00:19:31.20
And then you're screwed.

415
00:19:31.20 --> 00:19:33.36
Now you've got to boat washing up against the shore and you've got to deal with it.

416
00:19:33.36 --> 00:19:35.32
And it's a big, no, we always swim in.

417
00:19:35.32 --> 00:19:37.36
It's a big, it's a big target.

418
00:19:37.36 --> 00:19:38.36
Yeah, for sure.

419
00:19:38.36 --> 00:19:39.36
For sure.

420
00:19:39.36 --> 00:19:42.48
Like in Desert Storm, we inserted those coides.

421
00:19:42.48 --> 00:19:48.80
The officer I won't mention in names, but we want to bring both the boats into quite

422
00:19:48.80 --> 00:19:50.40
and let the quitey guys off.

423
00:19:50.40 --> 00:19:52.92
And I went, no, you keep it least.

424
00:19:52.92 --> 00:19:54.84
If you're going to do that, keep one boat back.

425
00:19:54.84 --> 00:19:58.16
If you keep another boat in the shore because they can give coverage fire.

426
00:19:58.16 --> 00:19:59.16
You know what I'm saying?

427
00:19:59.16 --> 00:20:02.56
And then if they have to eat and eat and you can be seen.

428
00:20:02.56 --> 00:20:04.56
That's a big target.

429
00:20:04.56 --> 00:20:05.56
You know what I mean?

430
00:20:05.56 --> 00:20:07.56
You just don't do that.

431
00:20:07.56 --> 00:20:10.12
Yeah, that's, there's so many things you've got to figure out with the water.

432
00:20:10.12 --> 00:20:14.16
And when you, when you get, like, that's why when we were in Iraq and we rarely did boat

433
00:20:14.16 --> 00:20:16.32
ops, we did some in the river.

434
00:20:16.32 --> 00:20:18.76
But you're just to either on foot.

435
00:20:18.76 --> 00:20:20.72
It's just everything is so much easier.

436
00:20:20.72 --> 00:20:21.72
It's crazy.

437
00:20:21.72 --> 00:20:22.72
It's crazy.

438
00:20:22.72 --> 00:20:26.64
Uh, then you get, so you get done with training.

439
00:20:26.64 --> 00:20:31.52
Sanctuary mile, 1967, you get done with training and you check in a UDT 12.

440
00:20:31.52 --> 00:20:33.64
And you didn't really know too much about the sealed things.

441
00:20:33.64 --> 00:20:36.24
I guess no one at that time knew much about the sealed things.

442
00:20:36.24 --> 00:20:38.000
No, not much at all.

443
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.84
And you were saying on that first podcast that we did that the Patoons weren't really

444
00:20:41.84 --> 00:20:42.84
formed up yet.

445
00:20:42.84 --> 00:20:47.44
You kind of showed up at UDT and it's, it's kind of a loose situation.

446
00:20:47.44 --> 00:20:48.88
But you do do a work up.

447
00:20:48.88 --> 00:20:51.88
Oh, once we started working up, then it was regimented.

448
00:20:51.88 --> 00:20:53.60
You know, you knew what you had to do.

449
00:20:53.60 --> 00:20:54.60
But we had a while.

450
00:20:54.60 --> 00:20:59.28
They had just come back and relieved UDT 11 and just deployed.

451
00:20:59.28 --> 00:21:03.76
And then 12 came back and you have a kind of a stand down about a month or two.

452
00:21:03.76 --> 00:21:05.16
Oh, so that's what we showed up for.

453
00:21:05.16 --> 00:21:06.16
Yeah.

454
00:21:06.16 --> 00:21:09.20
It's a nine month appointment for UDT's.

455
00:21:09.20 --> 00:21:11.56
So you have about six months work up.

456
00:21:11.56 --> 00:21:15.04
And then you have three months where the guys go on leave school stuff like that.

457
00:21:15.04 --> 00:21:18.04
And we came, I came in just at that time.

458
00:21:18.04 --> 00:21:23.20
So it was really kind of like, would go up and do what they call silver slippers up at

459
00:21:23.20 --> 00:21:27.96
Pendleton when the rains do and amphibious landings and we'd be the life guards and stuff

460
00:21:27.96 --> 00:21:28.96
like that.

461
00:21:28.96 --> 00:21:29.96
And you know what I mean?

462
00:21:29.96 --> 00:21:33.24
Until we started forming up and start working, then it got pretty good.

463
00:21:33.24 --> 00:21:34.96
What did you guys do?

464
00:21:34.96 --> 00:21:36.76
Were they hardcore about PT back then?

465
00:21:36.76 --> 00:21:37.76
Oh, yeah.

466
00:21:37.76 --> 00:21:39.20
Would you guys do team PT's?

467
00:21:39.20 --> 00:21:40.20
Yep.

468
00:21:40.20 --> 00:21:41.20
Peltunes are team.

469
00:21:41.20 --> 00:21:42.20
Team.

470
00:21:42.20 --> 00:21:43.20
The whole team.

471
00:21:43.20 --> 00:21:44.20
Yep.

472
00:21:44.20 --> 00:21:45.64
And was it just every day?

473
00:21:45.64 --> 00:21:46.64
Was it the same?

474
00:21:46.64 --> 00:21:48.60
Was it Flutterkicks, Porscheops, people?

475
00:21:48.60 --> 00:21:49.60
Just did?

476
00:21:49.60 --> 00:21:50.60
Just did.

477
00:21:50.60 --> 00:21:51.60
Yeah.

478
00:21:51.60 --> 00:21:52.60
Just did.

479
00:21:52.60 --> 00:21:53.60
Just did.

480
00:21:53.60 --> 00:21:54.60
Just did.

481
00:21:54.60 --> 00:21:55.60
Just did.

482
00:21:55.60 --> 00:21:55.60
Just did.

483
00:21:55.60 --> 00:21:56.60
Just did.

484
00:21:56.60 --> 00:21:57.60
Just did.

485
00:21:57.60 --> 00:21:57.60
Just did.

486
00:21:57.60 --> 00:21:58.60
Just did.

487
00:21:58.60 --> 00:21:58.60
Just did.

488
00:21:58.60 --> 00:21:59.60
Just did.

489
00:21:59.60 --> 00:21:59.60
Just did.

490
00:21:59.60 --> 00:22:00.60
Just did.

491
00:22:00.60 --> 00:22:01.60
Just did.

492
00:22:01.60 --> 00:22:02.60
Just did.

493
00:22:02.60 --> 00:22:03.60
Just did.

494
00:22:03.60 --> 00:22:04.60
Just did.

495
00:22:04.60 --> 00:22:05.60
Just did.

496
00:22:05.60 --> 00:22:06.60
Really good shape.

497
00:22:06.60 --> 00:22:07.60
Yeah.

498
00:22:07.60 --> 00:22:11.24
I mean, you didn't see a lot of the guys in the gym, lived in Heavy and stuff.

499
00:22:11.24 --> 00:22:12.76
That came on later on.

500
00:22:12.76 --> 00:22:19.28
Then, also, which I changed when I was later on was a chief and senior chief and stuff.

501
00:22:19.28 --> 00:22:24.88
And even now, not as no pills, we still dip Latune PT every morning.

502
00:22:24.88 --> 00:22:26.44
But we did every other day.

503
00:22:26.44 --> 00:22:31.02
Then that the guys go off and do the running, do their weight lifting and stuff like that.

504
00:22:31.02 --> 00:22:32.02
No workout.

505
00:22:32.02 --> 00:22:33.02
Well, you know.

506
00:22:33.02 --> 00:22:38.02
even though I thought PT in the morning first thing is the best to do. Yeah, especially when we're in a

507
00:22:38.02 --> 00:22:39.02
CBC can

508
00:22:39.02 --> 00:22:46.82
I have to guys would be throwing up and stuff with a DMPT. Yeah, I always like we used to at team one when I got to team one

509
00:22:46.82 --> 00:22:50.78
That was that team PT we did every day and team two is the same thing

510
00:22:50.78 --> 00:22:57.46
But you know, I'll tell you once the war started there's a lot less focus on PT and it just was

511
00:22:57.46 --> 00:23:03.56
Guys, you're saying the same way you are too jacquo you can't really go for long runs and shit or you're in a rock and jet

512
00:23:05.56 --> 00:23:07.56
We'd run around base

513
00:23:07.56 --> 00:23:13.98
But did you guys have my my question is that did you take weights with you? Did you have a workout place?

514
00:23:13.98 --> 00:23:19.22
We deployed and actually once one team shows up somewhere on deployment

515
00:23:19.22 --> 00:23:21.54
They all bring a bunch of gear and then

516
00:23:21.54 --> 00:23:28.20
There's enough to do it to get it done and then other teams don't have to bring everything

517
00:23:28.20 --> 00:23:31.88
But they'll bring more stuff and eventually you know, whatever compound you're in is pretty nice

518
00:23:31.88 --> 00:23:37.92
If you go to the same compound, yeah, and yeah, and I was briber on mats for for jiu jitsu

519
00:23:37.92 --> 00:23:40.88
I'd make a little jiu jitsu area so I could still of course

520
00:23:42.42 --> 00:23:48.40
So I could still train and get the boys train and and you know what's what it's like you were talking about

521
00:23:48.64 --> 00:23:50.64
It's weird how some of this stuff stays

522
00:23:50.64 --> 00:23:57.10
Because you're talking about walking around in UDT shorts and coral boots and on unfortunately UDT shorts

523
00:23:57.10 --> 00:24:01.10
I don't think guys, why don't I don't think they get it should do many more, but when I got the team one

524
00:24:01.10 --> 00:24:05.000
We absolutely got it should UDT shorts, and that's what that was our uniform and

525
00:24:05.32 --> 00:24:11.10
We got to shoot coral booties those old gray coral booties and I didn't realize you know

526
00:24:11.10 --> 00:24:15.82
That's what you guys wore that's not something they think yeah, I probably been issued for I don't know

527
00:24:15.82 --> 00:24:24.10
Even out in town you guys with coral boots and the rule x-watch and stuff you know to mean you can pick out a team guy in the heart

528
00:24:24.10 --> 00:24:27.98
Yeah, I was I looked I looked up coral booties

529
00:24:27.98 --> 00:24:31.10
And I was just seeing if anybody makes money more. They're hard to get there on eBay

530
00:24:31.26 --> 00:24:36.90
You got to buy a pair of an eBay. You got to be lucky if they have your size. I got to go through my guarantee if I still have my coral booties

531
00:24:39.62 --> 00:24:41.42
But

532
00:24:41.42 --> 00:24:46.40
And then you did do a legit work up though where you did all your hydro recon

533
00:24:46.40 --> 00:24:48.40
Yeah, we did some recon

534
00:24:48.40 --> 00:24:51.40
Like up the course by Pendleton

535
00:24:51.40 --> 00:24:53.40
We drugged this one

536
00:24:53.40 --> 00:25:00.14
Rocket-looking thing in up over these fucking mountains and put it in the lake and stuff like that and then we swim across the

537
00:25:01.22 --> 00:25:06.60
Well, did we swim now we didn't right there at the channel and it goes out. Yeah, you have those old gun in place

538
00:25:06.60 --> 00:25:13.80
But it was said where it would tack those and they had them set up a booby traps and stuff so we'd go across and work away up and shit like that

539
00:25:13.80 --> 00:25:19.80
always stuff yeah in UDT it was it wasn't bad. It was good training. I mean, but it wasn't you know

540
00:25:21.24 --> 00:25:23.48
This like a story I told you was

541
00:25:24.52 --> 00:25:33.60
During the 67-60 Tet we're in Don Tam on the Ascarion that's where where was the UDT and they're about 17 of us on there

542
00:25:33.60 --> 00:25:39.44
We're doing that dark thing later on getting that a little bit more, but that's when we worked with the 9-10-3 and stuff and

543
00:25:39.96 --> 00:25:47.92
Anyway, I had a simple tune in Mito which wasn't too far away, but it was right in the town why these coasts would have a

544
00:25:48.72 --> 00:25:49.92
would have a

545
00:25:49.92 --> 00:25:50.96
There

546
00:25:50.96 --> 00:25:56.30
place in in a town. I'd never know because anytime you left or when any were you know

547
00:25:56.30 --> 00:26:00.000
I'm saying you could be picked out anyway, so they were almost getting over ran

548
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.88
But they were on the tallest building in there at 57-1st rifle and stuff anyway

549
00:26:05.44 --> 00:26:11.52
Send a call out hey, we need help. There were 17 of us, you know on the Ascarion UDT guys

550
00:26:11.84 --> 00:26:15.52
We wanted to go in and rescue them and save them and our officer

551
00:26:16.16 --> 00:26:19.52
Just a great guy lieutenant said now you ain't going anywhere

552
00:26:20.08 --> 00:26:22.40
We're so how would you gotten in there helicopter?

553
00:26:22.40 --> 00:26:27.28
We don't know we just wanted to help them. Yeah, you know people are in coast

554
00:26:27.28 --> 00:26:32.56
Just ready to go, yeah, you know there's seals, but there's a T-guys too. So anyway, so

555
00:26:33.28 --> 00:26:37.76
We didn't do that and I got back from deployment when the seal team went through the category

556
00:26:38.48 --> 00:26:43.36
And then I know those guys those guys by the way, they didn't get over run. No, they they've brought them up

557
00:26:43.36 --> 00:26:44.48
They were coming up the

558
00:26:45.04 --> 00:26:49.76
stairways and they were throwing grenade down at him and stuff like that and then finally the arvon and the

559
00:26:49.76 --> 00:26:55.52
US came in and took me to a back over it was doing a 67-6-8-10 which was a cool bad

560
00:26:55.52 --> 00:27:00.80
But anyway, so when I got back and I went through cadry and stuff I found out, you know

561
00:27:01.12 --> 00:27:07.28
Okay, we weren't ready for this. We didn't know any immediate action drills and well not a lot not not

562
00:27:08.56 --> 00:27:11.68
You know pounded nor head row. We automatically think about him

563
00:27:11.92 --> 00:27:13.92
Did you know any urban environment whatsoever?

564
00:27:13.92 --> 00:27:18.64
That's the same plus we weren't urban and that was urban. Yeah, we'd add our asses handed to you

565
00:27:18.64 --> 00:27:26.48
You know because we didn't know we were fighters we'd have fought but you know figure those guys in me told the VC and stuff there

566
00:27:26.72 --> 00:27:30.24
They had their shit together. That was their talent stuff. You know me we'd uh

567
00:27:31.44 --> 00:27:35.36
You know more about the urban stuff than I do because they never fought or but you know

568
00:27:35.76 --> 00:27:40.72
We'd hit who it is and stuff like that, but we never swept through uh we did one village one time

569
00:27:40.72 --> 00:27:43.76
But it was you know it was good you know, I mean

570
00:27:43.76 --> 00:27:51.20
Yeah, yeah and so when you deployed to with UDT did you guys write a ship over there? Do you fly over there?

571
00:27:51.20 --> 00:27:55.20
How do you get to Vietnam? We flew over to Subiq Bay and

572
00:27:56.32 --> 00:28:02.08
Like I said that's where we were at that's like you went to Guam or Subiqo's our place

573
00:28:02.08 --> 00:28:05.52
Super Bay and then they would they would fly over to

574
00:28:06.56 --> 00:28:08.56
We had different deaths

575
00:28:08.56 --> 00:28:15.52
That we hadn't Vietnam like in the denying they had camped in Shaw and from the Nangied work up and around

576
00:28:15.92 --> 00:28:22.56
Fubai way quang three dug hall the northern part of the area and stuff you know and then we got on the dice shanko

577
00:28:22.56 --> 00:28:28.64
And I don't know if we picked the dice shanko up at Subiqo or not we might have and it was when we did all the beetroot runs

578
00:28:29.04 --> 00:28:34.80
And then the next day that I went to was down and a dog-tam on the road you go back to Subiqin between at all?

579
00:28:34.80 --> 00:28:40.16
Oh, yeah, oh really and would be there for about a month or three weeks and then we we had a

580
00:28:40.16 --> 00:28:45.76
Basically deploy from Subiq out to Vietnam do operations for a month and go back three months

581
00:28:46.16 --> 00:28:49.84
For three months at a time yeah, but it's a nine month to point it. Yeah

582
00:28:50.32 --> 00:28:56.32
So yeah, I we might three deaths were denying then on the dice shanko and then down in dog-tam

583
00:28:56.32 --> 00:28:59.84
One has a nudity that was three months in each place and

584
00:28:59.84 --> 00:29:06.28
And first of all the on the last one you talked talked about doing 130 miles worth of beetroot

585
00:29:06.28 --> 00:29:09.84
About 120 I think yeah, I'll give you the bonus 10

586
00:29:12.32 --> 00:29:17.32
But you know you were kind of talking about it like oh, you know we're doing this week on but that was you were you were reconning

587
00:29:17.96 --> 00:29:23.62
Beaches in North Vietnam. No South Vietnam and was there any resistance where you guys in

588
00:29:23.62 --> 00:29:30.18
Jeopardy. You've getting rolled up or was it more of like almost an admin thing or wasn't somewhere in between we always had either Marines or

589
00:29:30.58 --> 00:29:32.58
the arvon which was the

590
00:29:33.58 --> 00:29:36.06
South Vietnamese army they would

591
00:29:36.34 --> 00:29:42.58
Screen put screens out when we had do the beaches to cover us in case we got hit with anything because they were

592
00:29:42.86 --> 00:29:45.38
No, we knew what was really on the beaches and stuff

593
00:29:45.38 --> 00:29:52.10
But if the Marines are in the area that sent up a tro one that worked the back back short and stuff as we were doing our recon and stuff

594
00:29:52.10 --> 00:29:57.34
The one that told you we got hit was we didn't have any arm and army or Marines

595
00:29:57.34 --> 00:29:59.34
So we sent two of our guys in the back

596
00:29:59.82 --> 00:30:05.10
to kind of check things out as we're doing a recon and that's when we got caught in that almost caught in that

597
00:30:05.42 --> 00:30:07.42
El Shave Tam Bush and

598
00:30:07.42 --> 00:30:13.46
What happened was as we're coming down the beach and we had the guys out and I was a photographer

599
00:30:13.46 --> 00:30:16.46
So as I'll front with another guy and I had a

600
00:30:16.46 --> 00:30:24.14
pair of bathing suit and UDTs on coral booties and my super slate and I was right in the back showing information down

601
00:30:24.14 --> 00:30:25.10
I

602
00:30:25.10 --> 00:30:30.78
So everyone knows what we're talking about when you're gonna land people on beaches or if you're potentially gonna land people on beaches

603
00:30:30.78 --> 00:30:32.94
You have to do a reconnaissance of the beach

604
00:30:32.94 --> 00:30:38.10
But not just of the beach itself, but of the water and how deep the water is and make sure there's no obstacles in there

605
00:30:38.10 --> 00:30:43.50
And so the people that did this since World War II was the the underwater demolition team

606
00:30:43.50 --> 00:30:49.38
So that's what we're talking about the way you do it is you have a literally you have a line a big rope

607
00:30:49.74 --> 00:30:56.34
It's small. It's more like a line than it is rope, but that stretches from the beach from a couple guys on the beach

608
00:30:56.94 --> 00:31:01.62
Called the beach party all the way out to a boat a small little rubber boat

609
00:31:01.62 --> 00:31:07.94
Well, yeah, and that was an IBS we hooked it to it's about 30 feet has knots where you know each

610
00:31:07.94 --> 00:31:14.78
Paris gonna be holding on to and you mark take the sounding then you as you went to the next sounding

611
00:31:14.78 --> 00:31:18.78
Which was 25 yards down the beach and on the beast had be holding up these

612
00:31:19.54 --> 00:31:22.16
Markers so that you could get yourself on them

613
00:31:22.16 --> 00:31:27.66
You'd be dipping doing down until you got to that point again, then you'd take your sounding

614
00:31:27.66 --> 00:31:33.12
Yeah, then you come back and make a hydro graph recharge. So there's guys on the beach that are holding

615
00:31:33.12 --> 00:31:38.36
We call range markers and they're set. What do they say like 10 yards apart looking on guy in the front one guy in the back

616
00:31:38.36 --> 00:31:42.56
And they're looking at a compass so that they're making sure that they're lined up so that lines up this whole line

617
00:31:42.76 --> 00:31:46.36
So it's this it's this kind of complicated

618
00:31:46.84 --> 00:31:50.60
And it seems like an administrative thing, but you've got to do it otherwise

619
00:31:50.60 --> 00:31:56.32
You know you get a situation where the Marines come in land and they hit a like they did in Taro

620
00:31:56.32 --> 00:32:02.04
And they hit a big they hit a reef and then they drop the ramps the guys get out and

621
00:32:02.04 --> 00:32:05.92
They didn't know that that reef was only 10 feet long. It's two feet deep

622
00:32:05.92 --> 00:32:10.20
But now on the other side of the reef their guys are going into 10 12 15 feet of water and drown

623
00:32:10.36 --> 00:32:12.60
So that's why you have to actually be

624
00:32:13.08 --> 00:32:18.32
Fairly precise or as least as precise as you can be when you're taking these when you're doing this hydrogaphic reconnaissance

625
00:32:18.72 --> 00:32:24.28
So you have the back shore party, you know the two guys there have the officer and a couple other guys

626
00:32:24.84 --> 00:32:30.84
Picking up the stakes put the stakes out and that's usually photographers the obbure way out ahead of everybody else

627
00:32:30.84 --> 00:32:34.22
Taking the back shore information so that when you come back and do your

628
00:32:34.92 --> 00:32:40.56
Degraphic chart, you know you can lay it out exactly then you have to do it leave or you pan

629
00:32:40.56 --> 00:32:45.52
I was a good talker for I know all this good, so which I hated you know because you had to man make

630
00:32:46.20 --> 00:32:51.32
Hand draw the maps your hand drawing that and those those those charts that you draw

631
00:32:52.04 --> 00:32:58.68
You're gonna present those are gonna get presented to you know the Navy and they're gonna use those charts to conduct this landing

632
00:32:58.68 --> 00:33:02.60
So like I said they got to be good got to be good quality. Yeah, anyway, so

633
00:33:03.08 --> 00:33:07.88
The two guys are walking along and we're doing our beach reconnaissance everything well

634
00:33:07.88 --> 00:33:14.60
They they had a nail shaped ambush on us and they had a spider hole back here with a couple of guys that

635
00:33:14.60 --> 00:33:18.12
Once we got here and if anybody ran back these guys and holes them down

636
00:33:18.36 --> 00:33:22.20
We're two guys yet those two guys and the spider hole and open up on them

637
00:33:22.36 --> 00:33:25.72
Which made them open up on the sooner so we all

638
00:33:25.72 --> 00:33:28.76
Leap frog back down the beach away

639
00:33:30.12 --> 00:33:33.40
Really great guy. I mean took charge everything was perfect

640
00:33:33.48 --> 00:33:39.40
We grabbed them to the line to both the IBS took off and you know nine or nine to have a

641
00:33:40.04 --> 00:33:45.76
horse-by-ranging didn't go real fast, you know, and we had a close card cut her out there. They started lobbing in

642
00:33:47.12 --> 00:33:51.20
Willy Peter on them, but we didn't know it was them and some of it landed pretty close to us

643
00:33:51.20 --> 00:33:58.96
We thought there was them doing not trying to hit us anyway. We got out for an often our PL that we finally got to and got on

644
00:33:58.96 --> 00:34:07.68
Appeals, you know the both that the that we inserted off of and stuff and they picked us up in the guy

645
00:34:07.68 --> 00:34:12.36
And was shooting as 50 and stuff, but what was really neat was then come these two jets

646
00:34:12.92 --> 00:34:14.92
Oh, and they naep on the whole beat

647
00:34:14.92 --> 00:34:20.84
That was that was kind of cool that's when I told you when I got back to the boat

648
00:34:20.84 --> 00:34:22.84
I said the screws that snake and warrior ship

649
00:34:23.84 --> 00:34:26.64
I can't even use your in a pair of UDTs

650
00:34:27.64 --> 00:34:29.64
Call booties

651
00:34:29.64 --> 00:34:36.000
Like what the ref walkers a little they're like a like Chuck Converse Chuck Taylor's yeah, but a little bit leaner

652
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
No, no

653
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.48
Yeah, they were just like they were told so you could walk on coral yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

654
00:34:45.48 --> 00:34:48.000
It wouldn't like hold you down. They're not big thing

655
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.20
No, they were like they were canvas and they had a kind of a real thick rubberized bottom on it

656
00:34:54.20 --> 00:34:59.56
Yeah, yeah, they were good and then I had an M79 so I'm shooting that thing as I'm running back and stuff

657
00:34:59.56 --> 00:35:04.48
Then that's the only weapon you had as an as it's all I had yeah that and you're you're slate to draw on yeah

658
00:35:04.48 --> 00:35:06.48
Collect back short from you

659
00:35:06.48 --> 00:35:13.60
Yeah, so you kind of exciting and was that before you was that was that recon before you work with a ninth infantry?

660
00:35:13.60 --> 00:35:14.88
Yeah, yeah, okay

661
00:35:14.88 --> 00:35:22.32
I went from there from the dice and go down to Dong Tam and work with a ninth infantry and the the ninth infantry

662
00:35:23.60 --> 00:35:28.40
Man, so this stuff I was looking about you know about the ninth infantry and what they did and

663
00:35:28.96 --> 00:35:32.000
But just first of all the ninth infantry is the

664
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:40.36
Is the unit that the fictional character for us gump was supposed to be attached to which is why in the movies

665
00:35:40.36 --> 00:35:43.92
Working by the water and all that stuff. I imagine that's what that's why they picked it

666
00:35:45.40 --> 00:35:46.56
The

667
00:35:46.56 --> 00:35:52.36
ninth infantry in Vietnam had ten metal avoners awarded to soldiers and

668
00:35:53.12 --> 00:35:58.20
Three sailors so they were working in conjunction very closely with the brown water navy

669
00:35:58.20 --> 00:36:06.28
Which again to pull a quote from the last time you were on Roger you were like saying that job as being brown water navy was just

670
00:36:07.40 --> 00:36:09.000
Vicious John

671
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Vicious John and

672
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:19.52
General Westmoreland said that the ninth infantry division and the mobile rivering forces saved the Delta region from falling to the North Vietnamese

673
00:36:20.08 --> 00:36:24.08
Durned turn-tap that could have been I mean I didn't know wasn't on land with them

674
00:36:24.08 --> 00:36:30.28
Don't know where everything they did remember as the second class in and we got we were on the S the

675
00:36:31.12 --> 00:36:34.12
Ascarion Benoelle as

676
00:36:34.32 --> 00:36:39.48
Reconous in skies. What's the askering Benoelle? What do they were APDs? What's that?

677
00:36:40.48 --> 00:36:44.06
Enfibious some some kind of an amphibious ship. Yeah, okay

678
00:36:44.06 --> 00:36:49.04
For more big ones and troop ships. Okay, I think the askary was a troop ship

679
00:36:49.04 --> 00:36:51.28
I'm not sure could have been the Benoelle too

680
00:36:51.28 --> 00:36:56.02
But they were pretty good size ships and they were right at on the

681
00:36:56.86 --> 00:37:02.70
Right at Don Tam which was the Don Tam was had a big army base in a navy base and

682
00:37:03.40 --> 00:37:05.40
late my

683
00:37:05.72 --> 00:37:12.24
Third trip to Vietnam I went back to as a seal and it was the same same place same area

684
00:37:12.24 --> 00:37:16.02
So when you how did you guys get linked up with the ninth infantry? Well

685
00:37:16.02 --> 00:37:21.24
We that's who were doing the reconnaissance for to see if they could go up the canals and up the rivers

686
00:37:21.50 --> 00:37:28.54
You know see what the depth was so they could bring the the brownwater navy up there that the troop carriers and stuff like that for the

687
00:37:28.54 --> 00:37:34.04
Ninth infantry and they didn't know what the depth of some of the places they were gonna go in

688
00:37:34.04 --> 00:37:37.92
So they dropped us off on these we call them the darts

689
00:37:37.92 --> 00:37:42.32
They were like a jet ski right except you didn't sit up on me laid down on them

690
00:37:42.32 --> 00:37:50.12
Use your feet to guide them and they had a 355 degree camera and a phantom or they would

691
00:37:50.62 --> 00:37:54.80
Day two of a sub drop us off of we'd come down and do the reconnaissance

692
00:37:54.80 --> 00:38:00.44
I mean take soundings and take pictures of no one's point like a pagoda or another

693
00:38:00.72 --> 00:38:05.76
Canal coming in or something you know we come back and we do a chart and we'd give a to him

694
00:38:05.76 --> 00:38:10.32
And that's what they used those charts to go up and do their amphibious landings

695
00:38:10.32 --> 00:38:16.46
And but you could only go up those down those things maybe once or twice then you didn't do it again because

696
00:38:16.46 --> 00:38:19.44
They'd be waiting for you so when we weren't doing that

697
00:38:19.52 --> 00:38:24.64
Which you could only do so many of them then we started writing with the ninth infantry as their demo guys

698
00:38:25.04 --> 00:38:29.60
And so you would would you have already seen it because you'd do the dirt mission

699
00:38:29.60 --> 00:38:33.08
And then you'd come back and then they'd come up with their plan and then they'd say okay

700
00:38:33.08 --> 00:38:37.28
We're gonna go up that river that you just came down and so you'd be from we would you be familiar with it now?

701
00:38:37.28 --> 00:38:43.84
No, they took us we went up to four corners and other places that we'd never been okay that was deep enough for them to go up and stuff

702
00:38:43.84 --> 00:38:48.56
But they might have I don't know you know that would have been John O'Reach my OT

703
00:38:48.68 --> 00:38:54.16
That would have probably been in on the planning when they were gonna go in something and talk about our charts and stuff

704
00:38:54.16 --> 00:38:56.16
You know remember I just a vulgar eater

705
00:38:56.96 --> 00:38:58.96
Just one of the guys in the darts, you know

706
00:38:59.76 --> 00:39:03.12
And but then they said okay, we're gonna need you over the lock

707
00:39:03.12 --> 00:39:06.48
I know you were saying on the last podcast that they had these log dams at the

708
00:39:06.48 --> 00:39:12.80
Oh, yeah, they'd put dams across logs and they stopped the boats up and just different obstacles and shit

709
00:39:12.80 --> 00:39:19.60
Or bunkers along and now we'd go in and blow up the bunkers or blow up the log dams, you know if they had them and that's what I said

710
00:39:19.60 --> 00:39:26.44
They first put us on what they called an alpha boat which was the lead boat and they had one in the rare and one in the front and

711
00:39:27.84 --> 00:39:29.84
What would they look like

712
00:39:30.08 --> 00:39:35.96
I don't have a picture of right to show you yeah. I actually actually he looks looks up on the night's infantry

713
00:39:35.96 --> 00:39:41.48
WC yeah, but anyway the alphabet we're on one of those and that's the one I told you we got sunk on

714
00:39:41.72 --> 00:39:46.72
Because of before we rock and hit us right in the exhaust and things start going down and we ran it to shore

715
00:39:46.96 --> 00:39:49.80
If it'd been a little bit higher to hit all those stacks of

716
00:39:50.36 --> 00:39:55.32
C4 we had so but and then they started putting us in about the third or fourth boat back

717
00:39:55.32 --> 00:39:57.52
That's because they didn't want the big demo

718
00:39:57.52 --> 00:40:03.76
Yeah, in the front alpha boat. Yeah, that makes sense pretty much it that one out so your boat gets hit

719
00:40:03.76 --> 00:40:10.24
With a rocket and it starts sinking and then the the was it like a chief run in the boat?

720
00:40:10.48 --> 00:40:14.32
No, I was we could have been I didn't know for a first glass or something

721
00:40:14.32 --> 00:40:19.76
They ran it up and then it started sinking down and we got off dead a little perimeter and then the

722
00:40:20.88 --> 00:40:26.76
As it boat came up and just holds everything down and we swam over the zip boat and got off the zip boat

723
00:40:26.76 --> 00:40:31.36
It's so named because after the zip-o lighter because as a flame floor

724
00:40:31.36 --> 00:40:36.16
Yes, right gently out. I know I popped this stuff off like people know what it is

725
00:40:36.88 --> 00:40:42.64
You'd had to bend there to the see it, but I mean it came zipping up and then we swam over to it

726
00:40:42.64 --> 00:40:45.72
We got on it and got out of there and you got everyone out of there. Oh, it's yeah

727
00:40:45.72 --> 00:40:52.44
Nobody got hurt or killed on that just that before he rocked and they started opening up and the boats opened up to and they they had

728
00:40:52.96 --> 00:40:54.96
50s you know Jesus Christ

729
00:40:54.96 --> 00:40:57.68
Did you try and salvage any of the demo just leave it?

730
00:40:57.68 --> 00:41:03.84
Well actually or do you blow it and we were gonna come back and do that but they decided to have the O.D. do it

731
00:41:03.84 --> 00:41:07.80
So you do went back and blew the boat up and all that crap so yeah

732
00:41:08.24 --> 00:41:14.08
Because it was just partly out of the waters up, but they you know and pissed us off for underwater demolition was like you know

733
00:41:14.24 --> 00:41:16.24
Devied TF you know

734
00:41:16.24 --> 00:41:22.56
That's what we do you know, yeah, well the O.D guys. I guess they didn't have a lot to do so they sent them down there

735
00:41:22.56 --> 00:41:25.52
I don't know for his army or navy O.D. but

736
00:41:25.52 --> 00:41:30.56
You know it's always good to blow things up. That's one of my my first deployment. I

737
00:41:30.56 --> 00:41:33.92
To Iraq we didn't blow very much up and when I went to my second deployment to Iraq

738
00:41:33.92 --> 00:41:37.24
I kind of had the attitude as if we had the opportunity to blow something up

739
00:41:37.24 --> 00:41:39.24
We were gonna blow it up

740
00:41:39.24 --> 00:41:41.24
Seems like the smart thing to do

741
00:41:41.24 --> 00:41:43.24
Be never taken apart

742
00:41:43.24 --> 00:41:45.24
In place

743
00:41:45.24 --> 00:41:47.24
And

744
00:41:48.40 --> 00:41:55.08
That one you know on the last podcast you were talking about that one operation that you went on and you it was basically a

745
00:41:55.08 --> 00:41:58.04
giant ambush against the

746
00:41:58.40 --> 00:42:02.76
Whatever seven or eight boats that you guys had that the night infantry had and

747
00:42:04.40 --> 00:42:06.40
They must have been prepared

748
00:42:06.68 --> 00:42:07.68
Weeding

749
00:42:07.68 --> 00:42:14.92
For you got for this group to show up. I mean, what was the enemy that well organized at that point? I wouldn't say well organized

750
00:42:14.92 --> 00:42:18.80
But when you got setups guys dropping pamphlets in saying

751
00:42:19.32 --> 00:42:22.12
You know, we may be doing something this area

752
00:42:22.12 --> 00:42:25.20
You know all the good guys leave and stuff like that

753
00:42:25.44 --> 00:42:29.44
You know, I upset a lot to play with that or the choppers going around

754
00:42:30.40 --> 00:42:35.88
With their speakers and you know what I mean? Yeah, so yeah, that particular one

755
00:42:35.88 --> 00:42:38.32
There was another group of boats that went up ahead of us

756
00:42:38.92 --> 00:42:45.60
Dropped off their guys the 19th and 3 and we're coming back we passed them and since we got by I'm I'd say about

757
00:42:46.48 --> 00:42:50.92
10 minutes and we got opened up on they didn't hit the first group. They just hit our group

758
00:42:50.92 --> 00:42:56.16
And you know, that was a that was a bad day in dark city, but it you know

759
00:42:56.44 --> 00:42:58.44
It got hit really bad, but

760
00:42:58.44 --> 00:43:03.64
Managed to get to the shore and put some of the guys off and stuff and it was I think it was gonna be a

761
00:43:04.20 --> 00:43:11.36
Pincher movement where they came out for people because they dropped the other guys way off and there were three UDG guys on that

762
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.76
Group and then there was three of us on the group that when we got hit and your main mission was gonna be demo if

763
00:43:18.76 --> 00:43:20.76
Yeah, basically

764
00:43:20.76 --> 00:43:22.76
Yeah

765
00:43:22.76 --> 00:43:28.84
Those those big it's weird those are like straight up amphibious operations the armies conducted

766
00:43:29.40 --> 00:43:35.76
You know think about that and the Marines are holding the DMZ. Yeah. Yeah, you were saying that the Marines were busy up hold the DMZ at that time

767
00:43:35.76 --> 00:43:39.36
Yeah, it kind of blew me away that but the 19th century did a good job

768
00:43:39.36 --> 00:43:44.16
And they were fighters, you know and they were out of Washington state of Washington, you know and

769
00:43:45.40 --> 00:43:47.40
They

770
00:43:47.40 --> 00:43:49.40
We're good good toop

771
00:43:49.40 --> 00:43:50.40
Yeah

772
00:43:50.40 --> 00:43:55.28
What about another different difference I mean even with the ninth infantry

773
00:43:55.92 --> 00:43:59.04
Those guys I mean in UDT you guys are all volunteers and

774
00:44:00.32 --> 00:44:06.32
I mean and you said you wouldn't have been drafted ahead you not joined. What did you did you notice any difference

775
00:44:07.88 --> 00:44:12.08
between drafted guys and guys that were volunteers

776
00:44:15.20 --> 00:44:18.16
Didn't really work with that many army guys in the ninth

777
00:44:18.16 --> 00:44:23.68
If it treat you anything I can remember that stands out as I had a second lieutenant come up to me

778
00:44:23.68 --> 00:44:30.40
One is on a river boat one of the river boats. They were about right land them and he came up to me with his map and asked me where he was

779
00:44:30.40 --> 00:44:34.48
You know and that kind of I went and that's the second lieutenant

780
00:44:34.72 --> 00:44:36.72
He's leading up

781
00:44:36.72 --> 00:44:38.16
Platoon or

782
00:44:38.16 --> 00:44:44.72
Squad of guys in you know that kind of you know him saying I just don't know I don't know my thought of that was is

783
00:44:44.72 --> 00:44:51.84
We were trained and we knew what we were gonna do just like in the sealed team and we lean forward

784
00:44:51.84 --> 00:44:57.44
And that's what we're gonna do you're just picked off the street go through basic training and then you

785
00:44:58.72 --> 00:45:04.16
You know next thing you know you're up on a hill and Vietnam being over ran stuff that's gotta be pretty dramatic

786
00:45:04.16 --> 00:45:10.56
You know but then again Americans are Americans we fight you know I mean regardless, but I think we were more

787
00:45:10.56 --> 00:45:17.76
Psychologically set for what we did then you're because of the extra training we had and stuff

788
00:45:18.08 --> 00:45:23.92
Plus the guys that trained us were a lot of more Vietnam guys and like I said second world war and Korean

789
00:45:24.32 --> 00:45:28.64
That gives you and with the type of job they did that that's what we do

790
00:45:29.36 --> 00:45:35.12
You got wounded on that vision too. Yeah, right? How bad did you get wounded? Yes, some scrapping on my foot and my leg

791
00:45:35.12 --> 00:45:41.36
Who big thing did you think you out of the field for now? I thought at all in fact I got up and started shooting along this guy

792
00:45:42.16 --> 00:45:44.16
That's what they did

793
00:45:44.16 --> 00:45:45.84
But we had this buddy of ours

794
00:45:45.84 --> 00:45:48.48
I think I told you she got hit really bad

795
00:45:48.48 --> 00:45:55.36
We're happening on his arms and legs and I calls over to him after I moved my fingers and toes and everything and realized that we all got blown down

796
00:45:56.24 --> 00:46:00.40
And then I went over to him hitting with morphine put it through his collar then the

797
00:46:00.40 --> 00:46:06.56
30 gonna got blown off his gun so I got up to start shooting a 30 year in me no big thing but just what you do

798
00:46:06.56 --> 00:46:08.24
You know, yeah, we're in a

799
00:46:09.20 --> 00:46:11.20
So you shake back with that

800
00:46:12.32 --> 00:46:17.92
He got blown on the other side of him and calls over to him didn't see my pin through his collar

801
00:46:18.08 --> 00:46:21.60
So he had seen with another shot of morphing, you know, and about

802
00:46:22.56 --> 00:46:27.20
Four or five minutes he kind of set up like this is one to do something but he was he was screwed

803
00:46:27.20 --> 00:46:31.04
He was really bad and then me and we got up and started shooting and stuff and

804
00:46:32.16 --> 00:46:36.96
The guys that were down in everything were after I got a 30 ran out of ammo

805
00:46:36.96 --> 00:46:42.32
I started shooting 16s and they had hand-to-sub 16s and shooting stuff loading for us and shit

806
00:46:43.04 --> 00:46:47.04
And like I said the ramp went down we started going in towards the beach

807
00:46:47.60 --> 00:46:49.60
To let the guys that weren't

808
00:46:49.76 --> 00:46:55.28
Wounded get off and we started taking fire right through the front so I went to one side

809
00:46:55.28 --> 00:46:57.92
He went to the other side and I was using

810
00:46:58.80 --> 00:47:06.32
M79 to try to suppress fire and stuff and we backed off and then we got out of there and did you insert any of the army guys?

811
00:47:06.32 --> 00:47:07.92
Yeah about eight or nine of them yeah

812
00:47:08.56 --> 00:47:12.80
And how big how how many guys got inserted was that a company a company strikes?

813
00:47:12.80 --> 00:47:19.20
Yeah, not yeah was more than a company it was eight boats a lot of people about you can put about 25 30

814
00:47:19.20 --> 00:47:21.20
Okay, yeah

815
00:47:21.20 --> 00:47:28.000
We were here and we in like I said it was really a weird thing because you know we're sitting there and then everything just

816
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.16
Our fire going off and we heard number one boats hit

817
00:47:32.72 --> 00:47:38.08
We're number four boat and in order number three number four yeah number two boats hit

818
00:47:38.96 --> 00:47:42.72
Number three boats hit and I remember I just turned and looked at one said we're fucked

819
00:47:44.72 --> 00:47:50.000
Then we got hit and what it did is has a canvas cover and they had all those

820
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.76
Wire stretchers stacked up and the B40 rocker was heading right towards the

821
00:47:58.24 --> 00:48:00.24
Yeah

822
00:48:00.64 --> 00:48:05.92
Continental you know I mean whether drive it and everything but it went low and hit those stretchers and they just went

823
00:48:06.72 --> 00:48:08.72
You know all that shit went out so

824
00:48:09.36 --> 00:48:13.92
But you guys get good medical training. I mean obviously you had to give more fame. Well

825
00:48:13.92 --> 00:48:20.16
UDT yeah pretty good been in sealed team we had extensive medical training

826
00:48:20.72 --> 00:48:24.40
Fact of first of two and I went over is we had our first class corpsman

827
00:48:25.84 --> 00:48:30.88
Probably the best every week he had run a suit several other with soggy head wounds or something

828
00:48:30.88 --> 00:48:36.72
Sucking chest wounds and we had the same stuff that you guys did have the many things up in the woods

829
00:48:36.72 --> 00:48:43.04
And you'd have to run up and treat him and what to do and we learned to give ourselves a serum album

830
00:48:43.92 --> 00:48:48.64
In case the corpsman was hit or something you need to give yourself an ID we did all that stuff

831
00:48:48.64 --> 00:48:51.60
Yeah all of us carry that with us everybody had serum album

832
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.16
Which is a blood volume expander unit? I mean just in case you had to have it but

833
00:48:56.72 --> 00:49:01.92
UDT not so much we knew morphine right new basic some of the basics and

834
00:49:01.92 --> 00:49:08.24
You know press your eyes and turn it good. It's not real real good and you do

835
00:49:08.24 --> 00:49:12.48
They do a good job with that teach triple C class that they teach now that I forget

836
00:49:12.48 --> 00:49:18.24
You forget what it stands for but it's good combat trauma. Yeah guys learn that and so they know what to do when somebody gets hit

837
00:49:18.24 --> 00:49:20.88
Everybody in the pitoon knows like a decent amount

838
00:49:21.44 --> 00:49:23.44
To get the guy stable

839
00:49:23.44 --> 00:49:28.08
Told us and for two this is the one in 1690 says yeah, I'm the only corpsman here

840
00:49:28.48 --> 00:49:30.80
And if I get hit somebody's got to take care of me

841
00:49:30.80 --> 00:49:36.40
Yeah, so he wanted to get good for him so

842
00:49:38.48 --> 00:49:44.48
You get home from that deployment and now like you said you you knew you had enough of the naked warrior

843
00:49:44.48 --> 00:49:49.12
Stuff and you said I want to get a big machine gun, but I will say that was one of the best deployments

844
00:49:49.12 --> 00:49:56.24
I was on the guys and everything the UDT 12 at that time was comprised of class 40 41

845
00:49:56.24 --> 00:50:02.80
And 42 and some of 43 but everybody knew everybody you know, I mean it was the real tight and real good and

846
00:50:03.28 --> 00:50:07.84
Civic bay would put go on the shame. Oh sure what oh my god

847
00:50:09.28 --> 00:50:13.12
Yeah, I guess after we've been there for about three weeks you're ready to go to a

848
00:50:13.68 --> 00:50:17.76
Yeah, they're dead just to get out of there. You need to go to Vietnam to stay alive. Yeah, pretty much

849
00:50:18.64 --> 00:50:21.44
No, I never realized that you guys would go back to

850
00:50:22.16 --> 00:50:25.60
You know back to two big day in the middle of one and that's that's

851
00:50:25.60 --> 00:50:27.60
Yeah, well we would for

852
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:34.000
Then you'd head off to your next dad like you said we were there for nine months and each death was about three months

853
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:40.88
You know, I mean maybe a little less but we'd have some downtime and so we can then we'd have a return next at which is pretty nice, you know

854
00:50:42.16 --> 00:50:46.08
Nine months is a long time but still you know, but actually back in the day

855
00:50:46.72 --> 00:50:52.88
Civic bay was almost worse than Vietnam in Samaris because it was almost like the gangsters back in Chicago

856
00:50:52.88 --> 00:50:57.68
You had all these different gangs right after each other in shit and when you was walking down

857
00:50:57.68 --> 00:51:04.000
McSysai you almost had a look around the corner this if you know they were shooting at each other before you walk by and shit

858
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
It was uh it was pretty

859
00:51:07.12 --> 00:51:10.64
Kind of like the wild wild west and you said that the whole UDT

860
00:51:11.28 --> 00:51:16.000
12 at that time was made up of all guys from the same like five or six buds glass

861
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.20
Yeah, I was just that were there too from other classes, but

862
00:51:19.20 --> 00:51:25.04
It was a the majority of us that were put into the platoons and stuff for from class 40

863
00:51:25.76 --> 00:51:30.88
39 maybe yeah, 39 was ahead of us they would more than a lot of them went to someone to 12 to

864
00:51:31.12 --> 00:51:35.04
They used to split them 11 and 12 you went to a UDT team, right and then

865
00:51:35.60 --> 00:51:42.000
Yeah, there a lot of more guys that were you know behind us, but remember we only ran two classes a year and buds

866
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.80
Oh no kid, you know two classes a year yeah because 39 was graduated

867
00:51:46.80 --> 00:51:48.80
And

868
00:51:48.80 --> 00:51:56.32
Then we started 40 okay and then we graduated and that's when 41 was starting you know what do they run now like five?

869
00:51:56.32 --> 00:52:00.24
Yeah, something like that five six. It was something like five when I went through yeah, I think so

870
00:52:02.24 --> 00:52:03.52
So

871
00:52:03.52 --> 00:52:08.64
You had a good experience with UDT, but you still wanted oh, yeah, I got to go come in

872
00:52:09.68 --> 00:52:11.68
We put in the chat every month

873
00:52:11.68 --> 00:52:15.68
To go to steel team and the yelled at us and said yeah, none to get back, you know

874
00:52:15.68 --> 00:52:20.24
So when we got back we were the first two out of UDT and the Cadbury

875
00:52:20.24 --> 00:52:23.04
That's awesome and I was you know echo and I had a conversation

876
00:52:23.04 --> 00:52:26.64
I was talking about how we had steel team won when I was in training self-silting one

877
00:52:26.64 --> 00:52:30.64
We called ourselves cadre and I didn't really know where that came from

878
00:52:30.64 --> 00:52:34.88
But I knew that that was what it was called and we were proud that we were cadre

879
00:52:35.04 --> 00:52:39.12
But then I was listening to the podcast that you came on and you were talking about cadre

880
00:52:39.12 --> 00:52:42.72
And you guys actually called it cadre training that's what I skewed you was yeah

881
00:52:42.72 --> 00:52:47.84
Was cadre yeah guys that taught or we're in cadre instructors and that just carried on that

882
00:52:47.84 --> 00:52:49.44
Yeah, you know

883
00:52:49.44 --> 00:52:52.48
For two training was different, you know once you got in your gut out of

884
00:52:52.96 --> 00:52:59.60
Ask you to your cadre then you went to a platoon and you went through platoon turning two and that was still ran by some of the

885
00:53:00.16 --> 00:53:00.72
Coddbury

886
00:53:00.72 --> 00:53:03.44
Because we had our own training seven team one

887
00:53:04.16 --> 00:53:06.24
Team one training self-bent around that long, huh?

888
00:53:06.24 --> 00:53:08.80
It was yeah, yeah, that was only team

889
00:53:08.80 --> 00:53:14.64
That's true. What's another team members and UDT guys and seal guys yeah

890
00:53:15.60 --> 00:53:23.12
That work up or the cadre training now you started getting heavy with fieldcraft with I mean

891
00:53:23.12 --> 00:53:24.96
Oh everything yeah, all every

892
00:53:24.96 --> 00:53:31.12
Ambushes you name it and then we had the animal river we worked on and the animal river is a lot like Vietnam

893
00:53:31.12 --> 00:53:34.56
They actually set up a whole thing there to look like a village

894
00:53:34.56 --> 00:53:39.92
They had a little wouldn't now post where they you know at the home nine yard you have to work

895
00:53:39.92 --> 00:53:45.04
You'll go down and get in and work your way in and stuff and it was just like Vietnam. It was pretty close

896
00:53:45.84 --> 00:53:52.08
And that once again the people that are teaching you are seals that are in cadre now who probably just got back from Vietnam

897
00:53:52.08 --> 00:53:54.08
So they got fresh

898
00:53:54.96 --> 00:53:56.80
Information from the back of our experience

899
00:53:56.80 --> 00:54:01.52
But two and training are 20 to and team one every time a platoon came back that poll

900
00:54:01.52 --> 00:54:08.64
Two or three of the best guys from that platoon and put them into our training so and that was every platoon that came back

901
00:54:08.64 --> 00:54:14.48
They did that so you had a cross cut of all the different areas of Vietnam and guys that have been in there

902
00:54:14.48 --> 00:54:16.48
They did well and that's who

903
00:54:16.88 --> 00:54:18.88
That you don't know we had guys like

904
00:54:18.88 --> 00:54:24.96
And just some great guys. I mean we got good training and I mean there was no bullshit because they knew

905
00:54:26.08 --> 00:54:30.56
We knew that what we learned there was gonna save our asses in our buddies butts

906
00:54:30.56 --> 00:54:36.16
So we we got pound into our heads. We did river and stream crossing

907
00:54:37.76 --> 00:54:40.80
A lot because you had a lot of rivers and you know

908
00:54:41.28 --> 00:54:48.08
Small canal well not small can I was pretty good size either walked on them enough to decide or you went across them

909
00:54:48.08 --> 00:54:51.04
You know like as a 60-general I always cared about three

910
00:54:52.16 --> 00:54:58.16
UDTs with me you know to help me fold across but I'm just saying yeah to judge the current right

911
00:54:58.16 --> 00:55:02.64
So when you went out it would bring you right in where you're supposed to be and stuff like that

912
00:55:02.64 --> 00:55:06.48
You know I mean just a extensive training the out of all rivers not real

913
00:55:07.92 --> 00:55:12.72
It's not a real fast moving stream, but it's a good current and so you learned all that you know

914
00:55:12.72 --> 00:55:18.08
I mean all you learned what you had to have or your gear you had like we'd do

915
00:55:18.72 --> 00:55:22.80
Sort of cool stuff where there are 60s and yet to see where we needed to have the

916
00:55:22.80 --> 00:55:27.84
Floatation and stuff like that you know to me and it was pretty good actually when I went out to New Island

917
00:55:28.32 --> 00:55:30.32
We didn't even have the camp out there

918
00:55:30.80 --> 00:55:36.80
We had in Island itself the town there was a gas station and had about four or five

919
00:55:37.76 --> 00:55:43.92
Green little green trailers and that's where we stayed at and then they truck us up to where the

920
00:55:44.24 --> 00:55:50.08
Canal was the shooting stuff and a lot of times we'd go up there then we'd run back and stuff you know to mean and

921
00:55:50.08 --> 00:55:52.32
We'd go up to the chocolate mountains up to

922
00:55:53.68 --> 00:55:55.68
Bill wells and stuff like that for

923
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:02.32
Amboyce is and just you know, I mean and what we had no camp there wasn't no camp there. Siphon and Siphon

924
00:56:03.44 --> 00:56:07.68
What was that? Siphon I can't remember the Siphon that I mean all along that whole area in fact

925
00:56:08.08 --> 00:56:12.32
Later on or as implement to the stuff we'd be going to talk about and come back some other way

926
00:56:12.64 --> 00:56:16.88
In your still sea holes or 40 mic might had went into stuff, you know

927
00:56:16.88 --> 00:56:22.64
From back and how much how much work were you doing at night? Oh, that's all the only time we worked

928
00:56:22.64 --> 00:56:27.12
That's the only thing we do our media action drills and stuff during the day and stuff at all over

929
00:56:27.12 --> 00:56:32.48
Amboyce and all the other field graph that we did and everything was all at night because that's when we worked

930
00:56:33.04 --> 00:56:35.84
And that was the that was the known thing

931
00:56:35.84 --> 00:56:39.20
It was like he up working go out at night. That's what we do pretty much yeah

932
00:56:39.20 --> 00:56:46.000
How much did you guys did you guys go out if there was a full moon would you go out less in Vietnam would you go out less if there's a full moon?

933
00:56:46.80 --> 00:56:49.36
Cuz you don't fully do stuff you couldn't see that well

934
00:56:49.52 --> 00:56:55.60
It's still dark enough because sometimes in the desert a full moon. It's almost like daytime. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

935
00:56:56.40 --> 00:56:58.40
and

936
00:56:58.40 --> 00:57:00.88
What you know you're talking about gear a little bit and what you carried

937
00:57:01.60 --> 00:57:04.32
And there's all these kind of myths about what guys were doing

938
00:57:04.32 --> 00:57:11.68
Birken the day and in in Vietnam a one of them's blue jeans like everyone more blue jeans or a lot a lot of guys

939
00:57:11.68 --> 00:57:15.20
War blue jeans, which kind of makes sense to me because they're tough, right?

940
00:57:15.68 --> 00:57:18.56
That was the whole reason was I'm the skiddle's on go from

941
00:57:19.44 --> 00:57:26.40
And if you're in mangrove and stuff or wooden tear them and stuff rip stop would tear and if you've been down like you when you stopped and stuff

942
00:57:26.80 --> 00:57:30.88
The skiddle's in each alive right through the rip stop and stuff so we started wearing the

943
00:57:30.88 --> 00:57:35.76
Blue jeans and you wanted to get zip up blue jeans not the button up

944
00:57:36.32 --> 00:57:43.36
Because they also kept leaches if you had the button button up ones you were screwed and then sometimes we were panty holes are an

945
00:57:43.36 --> 00:57:50.88
ETHAT to keep leaches office, but we'd take the leave eyes and put them into our jungle boots and rivers tape them around so

946
00:57:51.04 --> 00:57:57.04
You know, we didn't just be hanging down or shit to come up and stuff because there are a lot of leaches over there

947
00:57:57.04 --> 00:58:03.76
No big thing, but I mean you just you just learned you know like I said that panty holes. It's pretty funny because we were on sea float

948
00:58:04.48 --> 00:58:07.28
Guys that'd be walking around with peeing can blue and

949
00:58:08.08 --> 00:58:12.88
Yellow panty holes on and stuff and sailors are giving us kind of some weird looks and shit

950
00:58:14.24 --> 00:58:16.96
It's kind of funny how about guys going barefoot?

951
00:58:17.20 --> 00:58:23.76
Well, we had a couple guys that do that and guys stepped on stuff and injured themselves and that I

952
00:58:23.76 --> 00:58:30.72
Didn't see that very much at all myself in my platoons maybe other platoons to tell you yeah, that was a big thing

953
00:58:30.72 --> 00:58:33.12
But a lot of times we don't walk on trails

954
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.60
We walk outside of the trails and there's all kinds of shit in there and you don't want to just be barefoot

955
00:58:39.60 --> 00:58:41.60
I guarantee

956
00:58:42.16 --> 00:58:44.16
So you get done with that

957
00:58:44.80 --> 00:58:48.88
Work up and everything how about how about like your your your pig gunner

958
00:58:48.88 --> 00:58:55.44
Higher stories about guys taking every round out of their belt and loobing every individual round especially

959
00:58:55.44 --> 00:59:02.16
Stony I heard that about stoner gunners that they take every round out of their belt and loob every individual round and put it back in there

960
00:59:02.16 --> 00:59:08.16
Is that not true? I've never seen an happening and we had four guys that carried the stoner machine gun

961
00:59:08.40 --> 00:59:12.96
In my last platoon, but I don't know why you'd take them out and put them back in

962
00:59:13.28 --> 00:59:17.12
Yeah, they jammed a lot, but that was just a stoner thing. We sent our guys to

963
00:59:17.12 --> 00:59:18.08
a

964
00:59:18.08 --> 00:59:23.20
Cadillac gauge which is who made the stoner so they could learn all the intricacies and and

965
00:59:23.92 --> 00:59:32.24
What to do if something happened you know, I mean the but the pig guns the 60 didn't have to worry about it that much as long as you took care of that

966
00:59:32.24 --> 00:59:33.76
Baby it did work for you

967
00:59:33.76 --> 00:59:35.76
Do you tell me ever had a malfunction was

968
00:59:36.72 --> 00:59:38.72
Operator error, you know

969
00:59:38.72 --> 00:59:40.72
I like having a slide down your arm

970
00:59:40.72 --> 00:59:43.52
Okay, and you get a link stuck in there or your

971
00:59:43.52 --> 00:59:48.48
She didn't hear you have your do brag around your neck and it gets caught and starts dragging

972
00:59:51.60 --> 00:59:58.64
Just things you learn you know, and I don't know who told me one one of the Vietnam seals told me this story that

973
00:59:59.12 --> 01:00:01.12
Like yeah, the

974
01:00:01.68 --> 01:00:04.24
Yes, he was a stoner gunner and when he came back

975
01:00:04.88 --> 01:00:10.16
He checked in his weapon and he was going and joined another platoon so he went to get a new stoner

976
01:00:10.16 --> 01:00:15.12
Not a new stoner, but one of the stoner's out of the armory and he got it went check the stoner out of the armory and

977
01:00:15.68 --> 01:00:21.04
Engraved in the buttstock of the stoner. It said everybody must get stoned

978
01:00:21.60 --> 01:00:24.72
Which I always got a good kick out that could have been

979
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.28
I was

980
01:00:27.28 --> 01:00:30.08
But that 60 it was just and you

981
01:00:30.56 --> 01:00:37.76
Developed exactly like my basic loaders about 630 because we had a hundred and thirty round box

982
01:00:37.76 --> 01:00:43.60
Okay, and we had China late made that goes went right on the side of it and we slung it, you know on the shot of from the hip

983
01:00:43.76 --> 01:00:48.40
But after shooting thousands of rounds from from the hip you get really good

984
01:00:48.40 --> 01:00:53.92
I had a barrel coordination of exactly where their round was gonna go but even regardless you always worked it in

985
01:00:55.04 --> 01:00:57.04
Doesn't it wasn't a

986
01:00:57.28 --> 01:00:59.84
It's gives me a point weapon like m14

987
01:00:59.84 --> 01:01:06.16
You know, it was a it's an area weapon, but still you can get pretty accurate with that some of the bitch and you'd always walk you around

988
01:01:06.16 --> 01:01:09.06
Because what you know rounds with the chain off kid

989
01:01:09.28 --> 01:01:16.48
Hit a guy just as well as get him right squirons chest or something and I use canteen pouches and

990
01:01:17.60 --> 01:01:24.72
I carried five campy canteen pouches around my waist and I put a hundred rounds there and leave about a

991
01:01:25.44 --> 01:01:27.44
Ninch out of that got it

992
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.96
Then when I food fired and I knew I was getting low I'd pop my lid open on my

993
01:01:32.96 --> 01:01:40.56
Canna had grab my thing of my 60 rounds snap men and dump them in and close it or

994
01:01:40.88 --> 01:01:45.52
The lid when it opened up had ridges on the side that would slide right in just dependent, you know

995
01:01:45.76 --> 01:01:50.56
But what was good about that box is you could be blown upside down or anything you still have the

996
01:01:51.12 --> 01:01:54.56
130 rounds already shoot you know, I mean that's why we liked it, but that's place

997
01:01:54.56 --> 01:02:02.80
It's a it's a navy experimental place called China Lake and we said we had them build them for us and they worked really well

998
01:02:02.80 --> 01:02:04.80
Did you use a sling? Yeah

999
01:02:05.60 --> 01:02:13.04
What we did is we took the big butt plate off put an aircraft butt plate on and if you notice in the back you have that round thing that we would take

1000
01:02:13.04 --> 01:02:20.08
I would it hooked a few that bring it up and took a hanger and made it down real like this and I put it around the front of the hanger

1001
01:02:20.08 --> 01:02:23.04
So you could take it off when you're in a chopper so you could hold it down

1002
01:02:23.04 --> 01:02:30.24
And then you could take it off put it on but you got it fit just right where it was just right exactly where you wanted to do and it worked great

1003
01:02:30.24 --> 01:02:31.44
You know

1004
01:02:31.44 --> 01:02:38.08
We were in vented fuchs man. We figured it out. You know like we was on this one bolt one time and we saw these

1005
01:02:38.48 --> 01:02:42.40
60 guys they were they had 60s on a boat you know they had these

1006
01:02:43.20 --> 01:02:49.60
Big metal containers at the rounds when we were lucky and it was a flex tube that went into the 60 and so

1007
01:02:49.60 --> 01:02:55.36
Couple k bars later we walked off with a couple of those and they were fit perfect in the back of it

1008
01:02:55.36 --> 01:02:56.56
Prec 70 seven

1009
01:02:57.12 --> 01:02:58.16
backpack

1010
01:02:58.16 --> 01:03:04.48
We could put them on held 500 rounds and you had the flex tube that went right into your 60

1011
01:03:05.04 --> 01:03:08.48
Yeah, to have a special feed tray for you know me know it's feed tray the

1012
01:03:09.20 --> 01:03:14.32
The feed tray was right on the end of the flex tube so it's set right in their perfect so

1013
01:03:14.32 --> 01:03:20.32
And then if we're doing enough the chopper charge the bunker off you had to a 500 rounds right there

1014
01:03:20.88 --> 01:03:25.68
It was kind of neat where the only ones of it and on that had that fact we came off choppers one time

1015
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.96
We're doing parakeet ops. I'll tell you about that later and

1016
01:03:29.44 --> 01:03:34.88
There was a whole bunch army guys and stuff where we landed with the choppers were getting off heat each other on the back and

1017
01:03:35.36 --> 01:03:40.08
And a couple good fire fights and shit, you know and just know the court of light coming up and everything

1018
01:03:40.08 --> 01:03:46.08
We're all bearded and you know Levi's and you know that shit and they're saying goddamn I told you

1019
01:03:46.08 --> 01:03:48.08
Had mercenary's over here

1020
01:03:48.40 --> 01:03:51.04
Was a mercenary's and one guy says no that seals

1021
01:03:52.32 --> 01:03:55.76
So you guys that you guys are the originators of the predator pack putting one

1022
01:03:55.76 --> 01:04:00.64
I think I think we were they use them on the bolts, but not on not out in the field you couldn't control it

1023
01:04:00.64 --> 01:04:04.08
Did you have to feed it? No, it just it fed itself

1024
01:04:04.08 --> 01:04:12.000
Right, I was a bodyguard the folder and nothing nothing. It just broke right through their butt. You had to be careful because if you took that thing often laid it down

1025
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
And didn't put a nail through the

1026
01:04:14.72 --> 01:04:17.60
Through the flex part of it all your rounds would come out

1027
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
So they have this big pile

1028
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.28
500 rounds is not good, you know, especially if he's in a fire fight and stuff trying to put it back in you know

1029
01:04:25.28 --> 01:04:27.28
I'm just and just funny

1030
01:04:27.28 --> 01:04:29.92
But it was I was pretty good me and a guy named

1031
01:04:29.92 --> 01:04:35.44
Two of us had those and we fixed them up just just playing and looking at it thinking

1032
01:04:36.08 --> 01:04:40.64
But you couldn't patrol at night with them on patrol because there was a client client

1033
01:04:40.64 --> 01:04:44.24
You could hear him moving that was only if you're actually going off and hit them

1034
01:04:44.24 --> 01:04:50.000
So like you say there are three types of ops we'd go into if we knew we were gonna take heavy

1035
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
One was a down pilot and

1036
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:59.60
Another silver tune in trouble and a bright light was bright light that's a prisoner war going into hit them get them out

1037
01:04:59.92 --> 01:05:04.56
But those three ops sort of the main main three witty wouldn't you no matter what you know

1038
01:05:05.68 --> 01:05:07.68
Yeah, that's awesome

1039
01:05:08.96 --> 01:05:12.16
You get so you finish your work up and

1040
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.60
Now you're over you go your first plan to Vietnam was this key low-polltune? Yeah, you know key low-polltune Vietnam

1041
01:05:19.60 --> 01:05:26.000
And you're saying you were doing the first podcast you were saying that you did dartboard operations

1042
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.32
Which was have a guy huck a dart because you guys it didn't have good intel

1043
01:05:30.80 --> 01:05:38.96
You didn't have good support with it. We were at a place called new name can and it was a Vietnamese firebase out in BFE

1044
01:05:38.96 --> 01:05:40.96
Jep, you know and

1045
01:05:40.96 --> 01:05:46.72
And we were here then down here. You had the river and sea flow where other squad was but our squad got put up here

1046
01:05:46.72 --> 01:05:52.96
That was the one so just one squad out there by itself. Yeah, okay with the Vietnamese guys had a firebase there

1047
01:05:52.96 --> 01:05:59.84
Okay, and there was not good intel so you basically would throw a dart at the dartboard and then do what go do an ambush there

1048
01:05:59.84 --> 01:06:01.28
Go set an ambush basically

1049
01:06:01.28 --> 01:06:04.64
Look set a ambush or something see what was up go patrol yeah

1050
01:06:06.24 --> 01:06:12.64
And that and you also were inserting primarily on on sand pan turn that deployment pretty much otherwise

1051
01:06:12.64 --> 01:06:18.72
We about three times we walked out of the firebase and walked back in and that's just that doesn't give you a warm and fuzzy

1052
01:06:18.72 --> 01:06:25.04
You know because change guards and stuff and you come back in all ACs moving out there and maybe they don't know what the

1053
01:06:25.68 --> 01:06:30.40
Bonnephide is for you coming back in and shit and you don't have to say that so yeah

1054
01:06:30.40 --> 01:06:35.36
We didn't do a lot up at new name can because of that and we only had sand pans

1055
01:06:35.36 --> 01:06:40.000
We didn't have any of our boats up there none of the mediums or lights or anything so

1056
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:46.40
After we'd been up there for about a month I think month and a half then they brought us

1057
01:06:47.04 --> 01:06:50.000
Maybe two months and then they brought us down to sea float

1058
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.20
Okay, then we start doing some good off-stand there the sand pans how big is the sand pan? How many guys could you fit in it?

1059
01:06:56.88 --> 01:07:02.16
four or five so you take two sand pans because we were ever yeah, we take two sand pans

1060
01:07:02.56 --> 01:07:07.52
You've ever gotten into a sand pan? No, there's a lot of real stable bull

1061
01:07:07.52 --> 01:07:14.48
The enemies are good in them because they're small but you get about five big Americans in there and it's

1062
01:07:15.04 --> 01:07:19.84
You have to be real careful and are you rowing it? No, it's got a little motor

1063
01:07:19.84 --> 01:07:22.40
The little lights we used to have a piano with us

1064
01:07:22.96 --> 01:07:28.16
Okay, we can put it along with us. Wasn't it just ourselves? No and then and then someone would stay with the boats

1065
01:07:29.36 --> 01:07:32.88
The go-of-the end would stay for the police and come back and get us you know

1066
01:07:32.88 --> 01:07:39.52
But you didn't start working a lot until you got to sea float. Yeah, and then what kind of officer do you know a sea float?

1067
01:07:39.52 --> 01:07:40.72
Yeah, same thing

1068
01:07:41.52 --> 01:07:45.52
Ambushes and going up every setting up Ambushes and that's what I told you

1069
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:53.12
I think it you know, I get a little bit confused sometimes on pbrs and swaps. I'm thinking they were pbrs that were down in the sea flow with

1070
01:07:53.52 --> 01:08:00.96
But they would we'd go up on the pbr and have a boss in the way to where this and a boss in winter could probably hold four or five guys

1071
01:08:00.96 --> 01:08:08.24
You know plus the guy on the front with a 60 and the guy driving it well with the way we had worked that is we had the whole

1072
01:08:08.24 --> 01:08:17.36
Platoon there one platoon would be going to do some well two guys out of the other I mean other one squatted go up and two guys from the other squad

1073
01:08:17.36 --> 01:08:19.36
luckily got to pick to be the

1074
01:08:20.08 --> 01:08:22.08
driver sitting up on

1075
01:08:22.32 --> 01:08:24.32
Thing driving the

1076
01:08:24.88 --> 01:08:30.72
Boston waiter and the other guy on the 60s. Why everybody else was just looking over the edge like this and didn't get

1077
01:08:30.72 --> 01:08:35.12
your again and wasn't you didn't get real excited when you were chosen to be the

1078
01:08:35.92 --> 01:08:43.68
The coxon you know how often would you guys make enemy contact when you guys go out on ambush because I had to be kind of like looking for a needle and a haystack right?

1079
01:08:43.68 --> 01:08:45.68
Yeah, we got

1080
01:08:45.92 --> 01:08:52.48
Got some contact that was the one down in the square bay. I told you about when we hit the wind I wasn't on that up when they hit that junk and

1081
01:08:53.04 --> 01:08:54.72
Then all the mother flarist our boss

1082
01:08:54.72 --> 01:09:00.48
I'm not realizing and a few other times we got in some some crap at that particular that

1083
01:09:02.72 --> 01:09:05.12
That platoon and that deployment

1084
01:09:05.84 --> 01:09:08.96
Wasn't we didn't do an awful. We went out a lot

1085
01:09:08.96 --> 01:09:11.76
We didn't get me wrong, but we didn't get a lot of firefighter stuff

1086
01:09:12.48 --> 01:09:14.80
It was my second platoon where we

1087
01:09:15.04 --> 01:09:21.84
Checked out and it sounds like I mean this is sort of classic and you and I were talking about this earlier today if you don't have good intel

1088
01:09:21.84 --> 01:09:27.36
That's it you know, I don't have a ambush all day without a sea flow. We didn't have that good of them tell you know and

1089
01:09:27.92 --> 01:09:31.36
Like we didn't have a chief of a platoon. We had a no-peal and

1090
01:09:32.72 --> 01:09:37.84
No mint and mention of any names, but he wasn't real good, but we had this other guy that chief corpsman

1091
01:09:37.84 --> 01:09:39.84
I told him not cheap at that corpsman

1092
01:09:40.48 --> 01:09:44.88
It was a first class and he kind of took over everything he had been with the Marines twice

1093
01:09:45.28 --> 01:09:50.16
Okay, to Vietnam so he was a good hand. You know, I mean had a ship together with smart and just

1094
01:09:50.16 --> 01:09:56.16
A couple funny things happening. There was down in the sea flow. I told you where that pilot closed moved and

1095
01:09:57.04 --> 01:10:00.40
I said, oh, you're looking for me. We thought we'd lost him. You know

1096
01:10:01.36 --> 01:10:02.72
And that was like

1097
01:10:02.72 --> 01:10:08.56
The chopper comes in and lands to him. Did one was pretty shot up and door gunner had been hit so they said hey

1098
01:10:09.12 --> 01:10:12.72
Anybody want to be a door gunner? We're going to go back and pick up some other guys. Well

1099
01:10:13.60 --> 01:10:18.56
Of course as a corpsman. Yeah, I'll go so he's in UDT. He's he throws a flag jacket on the helmet

1100
01:10:18.56 --> 01:10:25.44
And takes the door gunner position and they take off and about half hour later the chopper comes back in and lands

1101
01:10:25.68 --> 01:10:28.68
Shot up even more here he gets off the I mean

1102
01:10:29.60 --> 01:10:34.24
He gets off the both those this helmet down takes his flat. You got fuck on everything that again

1103
01:10:36.40 --> 01:10:38.40
Yeah, those we when we had

1104
01:10:38.80 --> 01:10:41.44
this guy Colonel Colonel reader on who's a

1105
01:10:42.32 --> 01:10:45.36
Pilot in Vietnam. He's through cobras in Vietnam in a second deployment

1106
01:10:45.36 --> 01:10:51.36
But those guys those pilots Vietnam the helicopter pilots of Vietnam's they did not they knew they were going to take

1107
01:10:51.68 --> 01:10:54.16
Throne's they just went in anyways, you know they were bad

1108
01:10:54.16 --> 01:11:00.64
That was the same as our seawalls and black ponies because the seawalls especially were just unbelievable guys

1109
01:11:00.64 --> 01:11:02.64
You know just

1110
01:11:02.64 --> 01:11:08.80
They were just bad ass dudes man. They uh and I told you that one story didn't I about that one chopper?

1111
01:11:09.36 --> 01:11:12.96
No, so we're kind of pin down behind this rice dice and

1112
01:11:12.96 --> 01:11:16.08
We're getting some pretty heavy fire from the

1113
01:11:16.72 --> 01:11:22.40
Trey lines so we're calling for a closer support in the seawalls, you know, so we're

1114
01:11:23.04 --> 01:11:27.92
Getting up shooting getting back down in May 60 and we're getting kind of low on ammo too except the seawalls

1115
01:11:28.32 --> 01:11:33.92
We always had ammo stage on the seawalls so you can kick it off to us when they came in so the seawalls are coming

1116
01:11:33.92 --> 01:11:35.04
We can hear the

1117
01:11:35.04 --> 01:11:36.32
Rolter's wobble

1118
01:11:36.32 --> 01:11:40.88
Well when the seawalls weren't doing they were the greatest when they weren't doing

1119
01:11:40.88 --> 01:11:44.88
Close there's a port that do siops that these great big speakers

1120
01:11:45.76 --> 01:11:52.48
So we hear this one seawall coming in behind us. We're still shooting everything also now the clear blue sky is for to God

1121
01:11:52.80 --> 01:11:59.12
You hear this we are the gods of hell fire and we bring you fire and the fucking rockets

1122
01:11:59.12 --> 01:12:05.76
When we're ahead and get the tree line and they either had a 50 or a minigun on one side of the seawall

1123
01:12:06.08 --> 01:12:09.76
And that seawall turned like that and just holes the down. I think that one had a minigun

1124
01:12:09.76 --> 01:12:14.80
And then right behind came another seawall but when they when we heard that we're like everybody just

1125
01:12:14.80 --> 01:12:16.80
Top shooting we looked back up like

1126
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Oh, dude it was unreal

1127
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.28
And that's such a thing

1128
01:12:21.28 --> 01:12:25.84
They didn't really suppress the fire so then the black pony had 2.7 rockets and

1129
01:12:26.32 --> 01:12:32.48
Black ponies came in with the 5-in zoomies and when they hit the tree line it was blown shit clurpover head

1130
01:12:32.72 --> 01:12:34.24
And that pretty much squelched it

1131
01:12:34.24 --> 01:12:35.68
Yeah

1132
01:12:35.68 --> 01:12:41.20
Seawall's came in the regular hewies that picked us up and got us out of there. That was that was a good off though

1133
01:12:41.20 --> 01:12:43.60
The the seawall swore the navy

1134
01:12:45.20 --> 01:12:50.56
Pilots navy vehicles gunships that came in supported and we're in like coldwards. They were regular. Yeah

1135
01:12:50.56 --> 01:12:53.52
They were there with rock-a-pods and I think

1136
01:12:54.32 --> 01:13:01.28
Like the black ponies had the 20-millimeter guns in the front and then the 5-in zoomies

1137
01:13:01.28 --> 01:13:06.32
They had the just a rock-a-pods but they had a 50-on-one side and or a

1138
01:13:08.16 --> 01:13:14.72
Minigun on the other side and the most important thing that they had from everything I've heard and from what you're telling me right now

1139
01:13:14.72 --> 01:13:21.12
Is they had balls? Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, they were just coming and we got drunk one night in our bar

1140
01:13:21.68 --> 01:13:25.68
Seawalls are on the army side and that's where they had the things so we figured hell

1141
01:13:25.68 --> 01:13:30.000
We'll go over and visit them and have them drink with us so we jumps in our six-by and

1142
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.72
Head it out we were they had the army base here and the navy base here

1143
01:13:34.72 --> 01:13:40.08
We were lived on the Vietnamese side and had our own on barracks all fortified. It was perfect

1144
01:13:40.08 --> 01:13:46.24
So anyway we got our six-by and was heading out when over where the seawall guys were we won the drink with us, you know

1145
01:13:46.64 --> 01:13:53.28
We had our sixies with stuff you never knew you know, so we get over there and go walking in their compound and everything all right boys get up

1146
01:13:53.28 --> 01:13:56.56
Let's drink well, see we made them drink with this naked

1147
01:13:56.56 --> 01:14:00.22
Because we were all naked so we're all sitting there drinking beers

1148
01:14:05.76 --> 01:14:11.64
Nakedness M60s and booze a like where this is going

1149
01:14:11.64 --> 01:14:15.04
Yeah, you guys had way much more fun and Vietnam the right

1150
01:14:15.04 --> 01:14:21.84
We had a good time. I'm telling you we weren't we would get back for an opt-o or debrief cleaner weapons and

1151
01:14:21.84 --> 01:14:26.76
Go up and get chips. You know, that's nothing Colonel readers said the same thing he goes he goes yeah, you know

1152
01:14:26.76 --> 01:14:31.28
We'd go out we'd fly we'd get shot up we'd have to come back and like put the birds and for repair

1153
01:14:31.28 --> 01:14:34.20
And then we'd get drunk yeah, and then we go and he goes I don't know

1154
01:14:34.32 --> 01:14:41.000
He really like looked at me and he said I don't know how you guys did it without alcohol basically

1155
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.60
I was a you know went to desert storm. We were over there nine months and no alcohol

1156
01:14:47.60 --> 01:14:52.08
So if it was okay, but it mean to me it was just like yeah, this isn't my war, you know

1157
01:14:53.92 --> 01:14:58.66
We really didn't do that much and yeah, you know the guy did recon's and stuff

1158
01:14:58.66 --> 01:15:03.96
Right, Michelle and we did that one deception up and when we inserted the Quadies

1159
01:15:03.96 --> 01:15:07.86
Yeah, they're in and then that's outside of that they never really gotten to a

1160
01:15:08.24 --> 01:15:10.48
Firefighter, you know, yeah

1161
01:15:10.48 --> 01:15:17.76
Now that that off with a seal if that was I'm assuming that was on your second deployment. Yeah, because your first your first deployment

1162
01:15:17.76 --> 01:15:23.04
You know, you did what you did, but it wasn't as fruitful. No, I did to me

1163
01:15:23.04 --> 01:15:30.84
Tell you the honest I got to come out of you teen the seal team. I was ready to hit the deck running and just seem like we didn't hit the deck running over there and

1164
01:15:32.56 --> 01:15:35.56
Just didn't have the intel. I don't think our

1165
01:15:35.56 --> 01:15:41.32
As you were saying leadership was all that good and stuff. I mean we had one guy the LT

1166
01:15:41.64 --> 01:15:43.64
They were doing some shit down in

1167
01:15:44.20 --> 01:15:51.12
Seaflo but up where we were we just didn't you couldn't it just wasn't that much you could do you would go out and look

1168
01:15:51.40 --> 01:15:56.64
Try to find shit and everything but we didn't have actionable intel. Yeah, that we could react on you know

1169
01:15:56.64 --> 01:15:58.80
What you found out later? That's what you have to have

1170
01:15:59.56 --> 01:16:03.48
Sometimes too. I think people spread their forces too thin like you think about it

1171
01:16:03.48 --> 01:16:06.68
You just take a squad and put them out there in a little nowhere with no intel support

1172
01:16:06.68 --> 01:16:09.56
And you got another squad in some other area with no intel support

1173
01:16:09.56 --> 01:16:14.76
You know, you might as well bring them together put a couple guys together intel and you start making something happen

1174
01:16:14.76 --> 01:16:18.34
Well the platoon before us that was there and stuff that that was

1175
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.84
Platoon those years gotten a lot of shit

1176
01:16:20.84 --> 01:16:26.72
You know, so I mean you got his metal wand or stuff like that and actually my second trip over

1177
01:16:27.60 --> 01:16:32.32
Had been in that platoon year on a mean and yeah, tell me some stories about they got a lot of shit

1178
01:16:32.32 --> 01:16:36.22
But that's we were stuck at new nam can and just didn't well

1179
01:16:36.56 --> 01:16:44.76
Chef right now you can see the human forest which is a very southern part of Vietnam and it's just triple canopy

1180
01:16:44.76 --> 01:16:47.76
Just I mean it's we were away from that a little bit you know

1181
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:54.78
But there's so many these guy there he had tattoos all over and I guess he had fought with the French against the Vietnamese

1182
01:16:54.78 --> 01:16:59.64
Vitt men, you know, which was the bad guys fighting the French same as we see and

1183
01:16:59.64 --> 01:17:05.88
And we're doing a turpper we're talking I mean I got down human forest, you know

1184
01:17:05.88 --> 01:17:08.60
That's he says yeah a whole

1185
01:17:09.64 --> 01:17:11.64
Company of

1186
01:17:11.64 --> 01:17:16.28
French for Legion per tubeers jumped in there and none of them ever came back out. We're going

1187
01:17:18.40 --> 01:17:25.12
Plus that's when I was telling him my last podcast I did that's where we landed and we're just starting to put our shit away and

1188
01:17:25.12 --> 01:17:31.72
The slow-slans and it's a screwdriver and good friend of mine real good friend of mine now and then when that

1189
01:17:31.72 --> 01:17:37.86
Loach took off we've got the shit mortar now for about two hours and that's really told him don't ever come here again

1190
01:17:40.36 --> 01:17:45.60
Yeah, so now when you get back you get back you do another work up and

1191
01:17:46.80 --> 01:17:50.60
Well actually you got out for a little bit you come back in you decide, you know

1192
01:17:50.60 --> 01:17:56.40
That's like when I went to college I had to go I had to get my once I got my commission I had to go to college and people tell

1193
01:17:56.40 --> 01:18:01.94
Would you learn in college and I'd say I learned in college never ever ever ever get out of the teams ever

1194
01:18:05.60 --> 01:18:11.20
You get out for a year or something and you come back in and getting your your second

1195
01:18:11.20 --> 01:18:14.20
Poutine getting ready to go to be it was that no Vemper Poutine? Yes, okay

1196
01:18:14.20 --> 01:18:19.84
That's you're he just passed and what a great guy. I mean I was either the Poutine commander

1197
01:18:19.84 --> 01:18:25.40
Yeah, he was the only you die we the OT you know he's a great guy just a great guy man

1198
01:18:25.40 --> 01:18:29.48
Yeah, and he just passed here about three weeks ago

1199
01:18:29.48 --> 01:18:34.08
We went up in the Rolls Crans and they buried human stuff, but he was a great guy man and

1200
01:18:34.92 --> 01:18:41.40
That work up that work up did it did much change between your first work up at seal team in your second one

1201
01:18:41.40 --> 01:18:48.20
Actually, what I got out came back in and went back through Cadbury. Oh, okay

1202
01:18:48.20 --> 01:18:52.36
Just a you know kind of fresh yourself refreshed. I've been about a year as out you know

1203
01:18:52.36 --> 01:18:55.16
I mean and it just what that's what he did in team one

1204
01:18:55.40 --> 01:18:59.76
If you were gone way over six months or something you went back to Cadbury

1205
01:18:59.92 --> 01:19:05.44
Just there even the guys that came from these coasts, you know just so they know how we worked and stuff which was good

1206
01:19:05.44 --> 01:19:13.92
Why was going through Cadbury Jerry Fletcher was out there with his platoon and they got to know him and I knew some of the other guys in Boutoon

1207
01:19:13.92 --> 01:19:16.16
So as soon as I got out of Cadbury

1208
01:19:16.16 --> 01:19:20.20
They lost a guy in their platoon and lucky enough as good enough to get into it

1209
01:19:20.20 --> 01:19:25.04
So I didn't go through the whole work up with November tune. I just got in it and

1210
01:19:25.84 --> 01:19:30.44
That's why I was telling you is down at the ring field. They used to have a firing range down there and

1211
01:19:32.20 --> 01:19:34.84
I was figuring out man. I might shoot something else

1212
01:19:34.84 --> 01:19:40.16
I you know that's when I actually asked the first that's when I picked up a 60 me in this guy

1213
01:19:42.44 --> 01:19:44.44
We shot at this career so log

1214
01:19:45.16 --> 01:19:49.32
pieces flew off the career so long and we set it on fire and I remember looking

1215
01:19:50.32 --> 01:19:52.32
They look at me and it was like

1216
01:19:52.60 --> 01:19:55.60
We're in so that was it

1217
01:19:56.32 --> 01:19:59.40
Yeah, the 60s a beautiful thing. Oh, it's a great thing

1218
01:19:59.40 --> 01:20:02.84
So this next

1219
01:20:03.24 --> 01:20:10.24
deployment and you mentioned this on the on the first podcast from you came on about the orders that you got from

1220
01:20:10.56 --> 01:20:14.36
Was it from Mac V. So I guess that who you get orders from now for V now for V

1221
01:20:14.48 --> 01:20:17.80
Nav for V okay, and we landed inside gun and

1222
01:20:18.44 --> 01:20:22.88
our LT die we went up to see where we're gonna go what?

1223
01:20:23.52 --> 01:20:26.76
What area we're gonna work in what province?

1224
01:20:26.76 --> 01:20:30.72
You know, he went up there and they told him why you got the Vinlong province, which is where

1225
01:20:31.16 --> 01:20:36.08
Dongtam is and stuff and he said his orders were to pacify it. That was it

1226
01:20:36.64 --> 01:20:42.80
And we brought it he picked up a whole bunch of money so we could pay our kick-arts and scouts and stuff like that

1227
01:20:42.80 --> 01:20:48.48
And we went to Dongtam while we stopped at Ben luck first. It's about 40 miles away from Dongtam

1228
01:20:48.72 --> 01:20:54.40
And there was another between their Gary Gallagher's between and we shows up in our six buys and stuff

1229
01:20:54.40 --> 01:20:58.16
And we're kind of rugged looking because we've been in Saigon for three days and

1230
01:20:58.96 --> 01:21:06.000
Have a good time and shit and come and walkin out and he looks at us. He goes got damn you guys look like he been here six months already

1231
01:21:06.88 --> 01:21:12.18
You always little be drag-oed and shit that we went to Dongtam, but we used to go back and forth

1232
01:21:12.18 --> 01:21:14.48
I was an epilotune

1233
01:21:14.48 --> 01:21:19.62
George anger, they just had some great guys. Yeah, and they were like just said there are sister platoon

1234
01:21:19.62 --> 01:21:26.36
You know, so we'd go and see each other once in a while with the sister platoon's deploy at the same time. No, they had been over there for three months

1235
01:21:26.36 --> 01:21:30.36
Okay, so was it like a overlap of three months between the platoon and some of them? Yeah

1236
01:21:31.08 --> 01:21:34.36
There's two of them may go at the same time. Usually when you got there

1237
01:21:34.36 --> 01:21:37.94
There was another platoon somewhere around yet rather e-scoff or west coast

1238
01:21:37.94 --> 01:21:43.14
Of course e-scoffs had two platoons over there. So fun tell. I'm thinking it was one tell

1239
01:21:43.98 --> 01:21:45.86
God, I'm still trying to think of that name

1240
01:21:45.86 --> 01:21:49.66
It's the right on a river and that's where these coast platoon was we never not be

1241
01:21:50.26 --> 01:21:56.06
That's where it was not be and that's where the e-scoffs platoon was there they had a platoon there and they had a platoon of meto

1242
01:21:56.46 --> 01:22:00.50
That was their two platoons and then we took over when they left

1243
01:22:00.74 --> 01:22:06.66
We took over the one that don't I at meto but we moved to Dongtam because we didn't want to be right in the middle of a

1244
01:22:07.34 --> 01:22:09.20
a city, you know or a big big

1245
01:22:09.20 --> 01:22:18.10
A town where we were sitting so we moved down to Dongtam and then the navy based in waters the army based in waters so they put us in the Vietnamese base that split them

1246
01:22:18.10 --> 01:22:22.98
So there you go. Yeah, that was good. We had our boats right there everything was perfect

1247
01:22:22.98 --> 01:22:28.10
We go to the army base the testfire weapons and shit and they were doing that all the time anyway

1248
01:22:28.10 --> 01:22:32.66
So it wasn't it's another thing I wonder how many to how they testfire their weapons and shit anyway

1249
01:22:33.04 --> 01:22:37.42
So what was your optempo like when you were on the second deployment with the platoon?

1250
01:22:37.42 --> 01:22:39.42
The platoon was a wind god about

1251
01:22:41.60 --> 01:22:43.60
Every two to three days

1252
01:22:43.60 --> 01:22:49.68
Because you had to gather in town and stuff like that and then it would get a little break and if we were real bored

1253
01:22:50.70 --> 01:22:53.20
We'd do what we called pair of key dops and

1254
01:22:53.90 --> 01:23:01.32
There was this area. I don't know if I talked about this in the first hot catchup, but it was a place called the Plain of Reeds and it was all

1255
01:23:01.32 --> 01:23:07.42
Enemy as all VC and so we'd take off four or five of us in a

1256
01:23:08.28 --> 01:23:15.04
QE in have a see wolf and front and back of us and we just fly out there start looking over

1257
01:23:15.24 --> 01:23:21.50
Gover small hamlins and really just if you see VC run around to get shot at did land us with sweep through

1258
01:23:21.84 --> 01:23:24.88
Then they'd pick us up and we'd go look for some more, you know

1259
01:23:25.12 --> 01:23:28.38
That's when we're bored, you know, we call them pair of key dops

1260
01:23:28.38 --> 01:23:34.52
Then the when we hit and start spreading around the seawolf would go off. I mean not seawolf and seaword

1261
01:23:34.52 --> 01:23:39.66
Which was our hewie and then the seawals and start circling looking for squirtiers and stuff, you know

1262
01:23:40.06 --> 01:23:43.50
It was good we might get in two or three firefighters. You know

1263
01:23:44.22 --> 01:23:46.22
Yeah, I guess

1264
01:23:46.22 --> 01:23:47.22
Yeah

1265
01:23:47.22 --> 01:23:48.22
That would daytime off

1266
01:23:48.22 --> 01:23:53.42
Yeah, so you're just to run in those daytime offs and what you would you just look at the map and say hey

1267
01:23:53.42 --> 01:23:56.38
This is probably a good spot. Yeah, the plan to read the whole place

1268
01:23:56.38 --> 01:23:57.98
Right

1269
01:23:57.98 --> 01:24:01.62
VC stronghold VC stronghold and a lot of VC out there

1270
01:24:02.66 --> 01:24:10.50
So and then that's when we took a couple of the Austrians with us on that and the spirit keyed off to stuff in the blue metal water

1271
01:24:11.62 --> 01:24:16.30
How they like it did they come back for more? Oh, yeah, we we have groups come down to this and I mean

1272
01:24:16.30 --> 01:24:17.26
I

1273
01:24:17.26 --> 01:24:23.50
To knew he did where the Austrolin the saus were and when I was them and that was pretty pretty unique, you know

1274
01:24:23.50 --> 01:24:26.06
My 60 and

1275
01:24:26.26 --> 01:24:33.42
About 500 rounds and 120 pound pack and walked around for about eight days. I was real happy about that

1276
01:24:34.22 --> 01:24:42.02
Yeah, that's not good. They were there great troops and you know, they loved coming down and working with us because we got contact and

1277
01:24:42.30 --> 01:24:47.54
When they you know up there they look for things to see if what they could find they had two types of things

1278
01:24:47.54 --> 01:24:53.66
We had a five man fighting patrol or a ten I mean a five man wrecky or a ten man fighting patrol

1279
01:24:53.66 --> 01:25:02.02
Well, we went out with him. It was a ten man fighting patrol because we were going to go into this area that the Austrolin armoured infantry had taken over this

1280
01:25:02.66 --> 01:25:03.86
North Indian

1281
01:25:03.86 --> 01:25:08.48
NBA North Vietnamese Army base camp and then just decimated it

1282
01:25:08.48 --> 01:25:13.50
Well, our job was to go see if any of the NBA had moved back into the area

1283
01:25:13.50 --> 01:25:21.02
And it was good best like I said my first podcast is the best reconnaissance guys I've ever ever worked with and their fighters too

1284
01:25:21.02 --> 01:25:27.84
Yeah, they're good good good good good troops. Yeah, some reason a lot of people ask me if you've ever worked with foreign troops

1285
01:25:27.84 --> 01:25:34.82
Everyone want to kind of kind of want to know what we think of their countries and their troops, you know, and you know the brits and the Aussies

1286
01:25:34.82 --> 01:25:37.72
You know the S.A.S. or top chill for the first year

1287
01:25:37.72 --> 01:25:43.64
The only ones that went out with us on patrol and I think were in Vietnam. We were the only ones that went out with them

1288
01:25:44.08 --> 01:25:50.70
You know, and it all started out with a couple of sask guys drinking the bar with a couple of our guys and

1289
01:25:51.10 --> 01:25:58.72
Pupar paths and telling tall tales and you know drinking bears and shit and I think you know we have this exchange and it's been on going

1290
01:25:58.72 --> 01:26:01.96
Yeah, yeah always when I was a team one there was always a

1291
01:26:02.84 --> 01:26:07.40
S.A.S. guy there. Yeah, did you when you went to go? Did you get to go to Austin?

1292
01:26:07.40 --> 01:26:14.66
I never went. No, you'd love it. Yeah, that's what we went tell. I always got I always got screwed out of going

1293
01:26:14.66 --> 01:26:19.66
Australia for a while times after Vietnam and hell, there was chill guys there that had been to Vietnam with

1294
01:26:19.66 --> 01:26:25.52
Yes, you know what I mean it was good. It was great. Yeah, I always got screwed for some reason

1295
01:26:25.52 --> 01:26:29.84
I'd always go. Yeah, we're going to go on Australian some something would come up where we wouldn't get to go

1296
01:26:30.24 --> 01:26:33.40
That's because your for the tune of us who wasn't very well like there's something

1297
01:26:34.04 --> 01:26:36.04
most likely

1298
01:26:36.04 --> 01:26:40.28
But when you said you're getting contacted a lot, so you're doing an op every two three days

1299
01:26:40.96 --> 01:26:43.68
How often are you guys getting an enemy contact?

1300
01:26:46.96 --> 01:26:51.16
Just thought every time we went out because we were going out on actionable intel

1301
01:26:51.16 --> 01:26:52.76
They don't I mean and I

1302
01:26:53.16 --> 01:26:59.54
Should I can't think of all of it like that one time I was telling you and another time we hit these two hooches and guys came out

1303
01:26:59.54 --> 01:27:02.54
It was like you'll kick the relks that we won and

1304
01:27:02.54 --> 01:27:04.54
And

1305
01:27:04.54 --> 01:27:08.70
another time we was doing this recon just looking and this one guy

1306
01:27:10.10 --> 01:27:14.26
Or gets up on top of this bunker because we couldn't find any entrance around it

1307
01:27:14.26 --> 01:27:16.82
They may have had a tunnel coming into it somewhere and he's up there

1308
01:27:16.82 --> 01:27:18.82
I'm staying here in the sky

1309
01:27:18.82 --> 01:27:23.78
This way as a 60's there and we're kind of watching the area for him ways up there looking around and

1310
01:27:24.46 --> 01:27:30.66
Tune tune tune tune right by me comes to safety 47 rounds and they miss me. I don't know how the hell they miss me

1311
01:27:30.66 --> 01:27:32.66
But then

1312
01:27:32.94 --> 01:27:36.30
jumps off the the bunker down right beside me and

1313
01:27:36.94 --> 01:27:40.34
This is gone. Yeah, the guys over there the guys over there in me and

1314
01:27:40.50 --> 01:27:46.52
Ariel and what's she's the son of a bitch finally we saw where his rounds came in and we started shooting another time

1315
01:27:46.52 --> 01:27:49.86
We got pinned down a little bit and we were gonna go and hit this

1316
01:27:51.02 --> 01:27:55.50
Check this hospital out and stuff we got hit pretty hard. We had a pull back and you know

1317
01:27:55.74 --> 01:27:58.06
We've got that might have been when we got pinned down

1318
01:27:58.06 --> 01:28:03.48
You know, is that when you called them the sea wolves? Yeah, we called them in a few times, you know

1319
01:28:03.48 --> 01:28:07.62
Yeah, no, it's it's interesting because people think that every time you go out

1320
01:28:07.62 --> 01:28:10.54
You're gonna get enemy contact and you could see I mean your first deployment

1321
01:28:10.54 --> 01:28:16.30
It was rare that you'd get enemy contact the second time. It's a lot more often yeah, like my first deployment to Iraq

1322
01:28:16.30 --> 01:28:22.70
We got like I don't know like four or five fire fights, maybe and they were all pretty like not not really a big deal

1323
01:28:22.70 --> 01:28:30.34
And then when I was a troop commander in the body the platoons were getting into it all the time. You know almost every not not almost every

1324
01:28:30.34 --> 01:28:35.18
But a lot of the times I mean I'm majority of times there'd be there be shooting going on, you know

1325
01:28:35.18 --> 01:28:41.78
Yeah, I might tell you I've talked a lot of guys that were in your platoon and Ramadi and they they'd follow you to the

1326
01:28:43.34 --> 01:28:49.10
The hell if they had it they loved you so just letting you know you had a real good impression and you

1327
01:28:49.10 --> 01:28:54.98
You were outstanding just telling you that that's for my guy and you know talking to the guys in the ground

1328
01:28:55.26 --> 01:28:57.26
Crinking stuff when your name comes up

1329
01:28:58.54 --> 01:29:00.78
Well, they're drunk I guess that's that's the reason

1330
01:29:02.14 --> 01:29:07.62
Just like you know, you know well those guys were those guys did those guys actually never mind

1331
01:29:07.62 --> 01:29:14.12
They would they did they they did all kind of stuff that was above way above and beyond the call of duty for sure and

1332
01:29:14.94 --> 01:29:16.94
God you want to fight

1333
01:29:16.94 --> 01:29:20.02
That's what that's what just supposed to do you know yeah was

1334
01:29:21.02 --> 01:29:25.28
There's an awesome deployment awesome deployment with work with awesome guys for sure

1335
01:29:25.28 --> 01:29:29.26
Hell we went out one time and we heard there was this cashier, you know, so

1336
01:29:29.66 --> 01:29:33.54
But we did want people to know they were going out there so we gotten to a

1337
01:29:34.34 --> 01:29:41.78
Retridger truck and hidden the back to that until they got close to where the cashier was then we went out and dug it up and came back

1338
01:29:41.78 --> 01:29:44.98
Just little things you know that was a need-off

1339
01:29:44.98 --> 01:29:46.98
Yeah, that's

1340
01:29:48.66 --> 01:29:50.66
That it's good stuff when

1341
01:29:51.66 --> 01:29:57.62
When you get back from that deployment and that was the last no Vemperpalton was the last fully deployed to Vietnam

1342
01:29:57.62 --> 01:30:02.88
Yeah, and you didn't get me you didn't go back to Sue Beck when you were in Superton, did you know that was like no

1343
01:30:02.88 --> 01:30:08.34
You can't see there's a whole time. Yeah, well you did get two weeks or a week or two weeks. I think of our NAR

1344
01:30:08.34 --> 01:30:11.14
And I think I went to Hawaii

1345
01:30:11.14 --> 01:30:19.02
And Thailand one time so echo support your choice of going to Hawaii. He's from Hawaii, so yeah, Hawaii isn't bad

1346
01:30:20.02 --> 01:30:23.98
Nope, that kind of weird don't go into Hawaii and everything is okay

1347
01:30:23.98 --> 01:30:29.12
I didn't piece for everything and you just come out of the woods and you know after you've been there for a while

1348
01:30:29.12 --> 01:30:31.86
You're you kind of want to go back, you know what I mean?

1349
01:30:31.86 --> 01:30:35.22
I don't know if I don't went to Thailand

1350
01:30:35.22 --> 01:30:38.70
I probably would have stayed in Thailand still been there now and I'd probably be dead

1351
01:30:38.70 --> 01:30:42.66
Yeah, there's a lot of people that go to Thailand and don't come back

1352
01:30:42.66 --> 01:30:44.66
Bangkok makes the hard man humble

1353
01:30:47.30 --> 01:30:52.32
I remember the last time we talked about this blue one blue that you guys had was that in November of Tune?

1354
01:30:52.72 --> 01:30:55.32
No, that was in Kilo. Oh, that was in Kilo

1355
01:30:55.32 --> 01:30:57.32
And that was our

1356
01:30:57.32 --> 01:31:00.32
That was our the officer that was with us in

1357
01:31:01.14 --> 01:31:06.72
New NAMM can and it was like you say it was supposed to be a hammer and anvil up it just went wrong

1358
01:31:06.72 --> 01:31:14.04
Yeah, and I I'm not sure if he was stood up to shoot or if he was trying to wave and tell him to stop you in any way

1359
01:31:14.04 --> 01:31:15.04
God he had you know

1360
01:31:15.36 --> 01:31:19.50
Killed him so and then we almost had another in November of Tune

1361
01:31:19.50 --> 01:31:23.76
I forgot to mention this so we're hitting this island. It's not a big island

1362
01:31:23.76 --> 01:31:25.76
But it had hooches all along one side

1363
01:31:26.24 --> 01:31:32.04
So they wanted us to go through and check out the hooches and we had what we called white mice with us

1364
01:31:32.04 --> 01:31:36.64
They were Vietnamese intel guys. I could look through things and find out

1365
01:31:36.64 --> 01:31:42.64
There's any VC stuff you know what I mean so I think so we land some or sweeping through it

1366
01:31:42.64 --> 01:31:46.80
And I had this one white mice with me and I had my 60 well the guy that

1367
01:31:48.96 --> 01:31:53.72
Plan this off and thought it was a good idea was our dead golf guy and

1368
01:31:53.72 --> 01:32:00.40
That golf was your senior seal was that death golf and he was kind of in charge of all the other platoons ever spread out and

1369
01:32:00.40 --> 01:32:06.20
And so we did it and he was with us and he has interpreter

1370
01:32:06.20 --> 01:32:11.52
So and we were told everybody stay on the side when we patrol because anything on the

1371
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:17.20
Less side is a free fire zone right so we're walking along and I'm looking at the woods

1372
01:32:17.20 --> 01:32:19.20
And I'll say I see this flit and through the woods

1373
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.96
So I bring my 60 up take it off a safe and I'm watching well where the woods were there was a space and another part of the woods

1374
01:32:26.96 --> 01:32:32.72
I wanted the VC who I thought it was to get out in the space and then at hammering you know

1375
01:32:32.72 --> 01:32:38.96
Open up in my 60 and we were spread out a little bit because everybody was checking different things out as we're going along

1376
01:32:38.96 --> 01:32:44.42
So I had it off safe. I'm just haven't laid it up on this rice rice bag

1377
01:32:44.42 --> 01:32:47.28
You know with rice on it and just waiting who comes out?

1378
01:32:48.32 --> 01:32:49.52
But the

1379
01:32:49.52 --> 01:32:55.000
The dead golf guy I was so fucking pissed I'd have been a new guy. I'd open up

1380
01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:01.52
You know, I mean maybe killed him and things so I told Jerry Fletch and my LT about it and he never went out with us again

1381
01:33:01.88 --> 01:33:04.56
Because that was crazy. He was on the free fire zone

1382
01:33:04.56 --> 01:33:08.28
You know what I mean and like you say what if I'd been a brand new guy or something

1383
01:33:08.28 --> 01:33:12.60
But I wanted to wait till he got out so I had a clear picture before I opened up on him

1384
01:33:12.60 --> 01:33:16.12
Yeah, I mean even your mindset wasn't even let me confirm this is a bad guy

1385
01:33:16.12 --> 01:33:19.26
You knew it was a bad guy. You were just waiting for the him out the bad guy

1386
01:33:19.26 --> 01:33:22.000
Yeah, yeah, I was the same thing that might be one of our guys

1387
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:27.80
Who was a bad guy because we had already briefed heavily everybody stay on this side

1388
01:33:27.80 --> 01:33:32.12
Anybody over there and you see him open up on him. You know when I was running training man

1389
01:33:32.12 --> 01:33:34.62
I I worked those guys

1390
01:33:34.96 --> 01:33:37.64
They would have blue on blues all the time in training

1391
01:33:37.64 --> 01:33:40.60
I mean we would just make stuff so confusing and just

1392
01:33:41.20 --> 01:33:44.04
Put the enemy in the wrong place and get guys confused

1393
01:33:44.04 --> 01:33:48.28
I wanted them to have blue on blues and training so they realized how easy it is to happen

1394
01:33:48.28 --> 01:33:52.84
So you get a guy instead of making that decision like oh, just you know what this probably get a good vantage point over here

1395
01:33:52.84 --> 01:33:57.12
If I just walk over here and they'll know it's me you know it's like no they won't know it's you they'll kill you

1396
01:33:57.60 --> 01:33:59.60
So yeah, it's

1397
01:33:59.60 --> 01:34:03.72
You've got a people don't understand how confusing it gets out there man. It gets confusing

1398
01:34:03.72 --> 01:34:09.24
That's that's what you're training in your like I was telling you know the same dark button Vietnam

1399
01:34:09.24 --> 01:34:13.84
What's our media action drills and have them so ingrained into us that it's dark

1400
01:34:13.84 --> 01:34:19.76
You know exactly where the guy is gonna be and what you're gonna do whether it's a peel off or whether you're going to the right or left

1401
01:34:19.76 --> 01:34:23.92
You know me getting out of the the fire zone whatever you know

1402
01:34:23.92 --> 01:34:28.56
I mean but you had to have that man that was immediate action drills to me or the key

1403
01:34:28.76 --> 01:34:33.96
No matter what you're doing whether it's urban or I think which I can't really say no

1404
01:34:33.96 --> 01:34:37.80
It's the same thing it's the same thing in urban environment. You gotta have a media act

1405
01:34:37.80 --> 01:34:43.96
Like say you have a hooch there and you're gonna hit the hooch, you know and we know there's probably bad guys in it

1406
01:34:43.96 --> 01:34:50.28
You know we're coming in what we do is two guys to branch out to the right or left to get anybody from behind

1407
01:34:50.28 --> 01:34:56.32
The rest one would go in one guy would turn around look that way and the guys that go in and that way they can shoot

1408
01:34:56.80 --> 01:34:58.08
You know

1409
01:34:58.08 --> 01:35:03.44
180 you know me and nobody was down now if the hooch was covered and had foliage around it

1410
01:35:03.44 --> 01:35:11.000
Then as we came in one of the guys and the left would go down lay down look behind the other guy'd be right here at the corner

1411
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.54
So he could see anybody coming out of window and then we'd have the other guy over here and then we'd go in and hit it

1412
01:35:16.54 --> 01:35:18.54
But what I'm saying is when we did that

1413
01:35:19.12 --> 01:35:22.36
It was like that. I mean that and that was our immediate action

1414
01:35:23.04 --> 01:35:27.64
Stuff that we did that's how we'd hit a hooch. Yeah, and then when guys went in that switch

1415
01:35:27.64 --> 01:35:34.66
When it's swing high one and swing low just you know to check it out then they'd go through then they'd say clear or we got someone and

1416
01:35:34.96 --> 01:35:36.96
Whoever was right next to the door

1417
01:35:37.60 --> 01:35:44.72
Face now because we had her security and it didn't know if any but he was gonna come behind you as it bring the guy out like I had my 60

1418
01:35:44.72 --> 01:35:47.12
I'd stick my 60 right between his legs and

1419
01:35:47.40 --> 01:35:50.60
Get fall down then and put my 60 Miss mouth and go shhh

1420
01:35:51.04 --> 01:35:53.04
He wouldn't say much, you know

1421
01:35:53.04 --> 01:35:58.96
It would take off. Yeah, that you were talking about how the S.A.S. one time you went out

1422
01:35:58.96 --> 01:36:04.20
I'm sure with the S.A.S. and they went out they you're out there for like 10 days and no one said a single word

1423
01:36:04.20 --> 01:36:08.70
Not a whole time if you did say 7 you put your right next to the guys are your mouth

1424
01:36:08.70 --> 01:36:10.70
Yeah, right actually they were in talk

1425
01:36:10.70 --> 01:36:12.70
Yeah, normally it was all hand-seeing was

1426
01:36:12.80 --> 01:36:17.96
But like what you're talking about all the stuff that you just described do all that stuff without talking everyone just knows where to go

1427
01:36:17.96 --> 01:36:20.04
It's all the time. It's a standard operating procedure

1428
01:36:20.04 --> 01:36:25.84
It's the immediate action drill and everybody knows exactly what to do and yeah, that's just like you get a booby trap or something

1429
01:36:25.84 --> 01:36:29.96
This smartest thing to do is back away and come in a different way, but if you had to keep going

1430
01:36:30.28 --> 01:36:32.28
You'd feel it with your hand and

1431
01:36:32.84 --> 01:36:37.16
Grab the guy next year behind you and show him where it was then you had to step over it

1432
01:36:37.16 --> 01:36:42.30
We've on a few steps away till he got over it by grabbing a guy behind him and you just keep moving

1433
01:36:42.30 --> 01:36:45.04
Yeah, that's the how often would you guys do that?

1434
01:36:45.04 --> 01:36:51.36
Not too often we we did run into him occasionally, but we were kind of lucky we never had plus you'd see

1435
01:36:52.60 --> 01:36:57.40
You'd be able to pick up the signs if you did happen to go on a trail you could see

1436
01:36:58.84 --> 01:37:05.32
Broken branches facing in a certain way or little little sticks pointing in a certain way or actually

1437
01:37:05.32 --> 01:37:10.96
We got landed one time in this rice patty and we look after we got off every start

1438
01:37:10.96 --> 01:37:16.16
Look around and all you can see was two doys signs which you might mind field so we didn't move

1439
01:37:16.16 --> 01:37:18.16
You know we just called the choppers back in

1440
01:37:20.16 --> 01:37:22.56
So you're you're second deployment to Vietnam

1441
01:37:23.52 --> 01:37:29.84
How many cows? How many cows did you know one got killed right? Oh, we didn't get anybody hit or killed no one got hit or killed

1442
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Despite getting in all those gun fights

1443
01:37:33.12 --> 01:37:37.94
Don't ask me one of those things God's a frog man. Yeah, we we figured

1444
01:37:37.94 --> 01:37:42.98
You know we're getting to the point that's why we had six month deployments and not a year

1445
01:37:42.98 --> 01:37:47.02
Yeah, or you know whatever because you start getting feeling like you're

1446
01:37:47.50 --> 01:37:56.18
Involverable, you know, but we're on the cut edge and we just had the firepower we're better. I mean you could have had the odd child like that one

1447
01:37:57.46 --> 01:38:00.80
Yeah, when I went right by me or something I couldn't get me right in the chest

1448
01:38:00.80 --> 01:38:02.80
No, you had too much skill to get hit

1449
01:38:02.80 --> 01:38:03.80
I don't know

1450
01:38:03.80 --> 01:38:05.80
I wasn't skill that if you're lucky

1451
01:38:05.80 --> 01:38:07.80
Yeah, I know it's like

1452
01:38:08.72 --> 01:38:14.20
Unfortunately in combat you can do everything right you can still get killed and all kinds of things wrong and live

1453
01:38:14.20 --> 01:38:19.64
We did that stable high-namboyce that one night. I think I told you about that. I don't think so. Okay, so

1454
01:38:20.60 --> 01:38:22.92
About a section of we had and not

1455
01:38:23.56 --> 01:38:28.60
Thought we're going to go ahead and hit this one area here and if no reason the

1456
01:38:28.92 --> 01:38:35.16
The little village or anything like that then we're gonna do a stable high-namboyce and so a squad of us went in and

1457
01:38:35.16 --> 01:38:37.56
And put 12 through through some

1458
01:38:38.04 --> 01:38:41.32
Willy Peter into Hootjes and shit like that and just kind of

1459
01:38:41.88 --> 01:38:45.52
Caused hating discontent and then the sun start going down

1460
01:38:46.20 --> 01:38:49.64
So soon as it's hard going down we've gotten an L-shaped ambush

1461
01:38:50.04 --> 01:38:53.96
Being in were rice padded you're going this way that were in stuff and then we had the other

1462
01:38:54.48 --> 01:38:57.04
choppers came in like they were gonna pick us up

1463
01:38:57.16 --> 01:39:02.64
We had a rather squad on it. They got off the chopper ran around and got back in it like we're being extracted right

1464
01:39:02.64 --> 01:39:05.20
So we sat there and sat there for about

1465
01:39:05.84 --> 01:39:07.44
45 minutes almost an hour

1466
01:39:07.44 --> 01:39:15.000
No, so in here these guys can walk in on the thrice type with AK 47's and shit and stuff and now we opened up on them and you know

1467
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.52
Bloom off the rice diet and shit and then they opened up on us from the tree line

1468
01:39:20.12 --> 01:39:25.96
Hit him a little bit the seawalls came in did some damage and shit and then the fucking chopper came in

1469
01:39:25.96 --> 01:39:28.28
There's only one of them so we all couldn't get on it

1470
01:39:28.56 --> 01:39:30.48
We landed with two choppers, you know

1471
01:39:30.48 --> 01:39:35.20
So me and another guy a radio man and a stoner guy myself

1472
01:39:35.88 --> 01:39:39.32
stayed there where that chopper went long-tam wasn't too far away

1473
01:39:39.68 --> 01:39:43.80
Come back and pick this up, you know my poop was a little tight tight on that

1474
01:39:44.80 --> 01:39:48.74
No, I was along the way you said on the ground. Oh, about another 20 minutes

1475
01:39:48.74 --> 01:39:52.96
That would be lonely but nobody came in to the village after that because we'd

1476
01:39:53.20 --> 01:39:56.80
You would hammer them, you know pretty bad, so now it was pretty good

1477
01:39:56.80 --> 01:40:03.92
That was a brilliant off anyway, so I'm shooting my 60 is over here shooting 40 Mike Mike and there's a small stream between us

1478
01:40:03.92 --> 01:40:08.84
And we got back for drinking beers patting poopers, seeing you know telling tall tales and she has it

1479
01:40:09.28 --> 01:40:11.92
It says God damn didn't you see that fucking

1480
01:40:12.92 --> 01:40:17.90
String around so went right by you on that stream and I said no because I shoot my 60

1481
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
It was pretty the you know, I mean

1482
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.44
Yeah, that's a good time

1483
01:40:22.44 --> 01:40:28.24
Yeah, that's an amazing deployment to do that was a jable high-namborge classic

1484
01:40:28.24 --> 01:40:30.24
Yeah, I mean just the way you want to do it

1485
01:40:30.24 --> 01:40:34.96
They knew it was there they thought we had left they came in and we got the son of bitches

1486
01:40:35.44 --> 01:40:38.04
Yeah, you know and then they always saying you know

1487
01:40:38.44 --> 01:40:44.56
Did just shoot a guy yourself well, you know when you will bring up a stoner to the 60s and you see guys flying off a rice taxi

1488
01:40:44.56 --> 01:40:49.64
She said you're not sure if it's your 60 that hit them or if it's the stoner or whatever, you know

1489
01:40:49.64 --> 01:40:50.64
Yeah, so

1490
01:40:50.64 --> 01:40:52.64
Only one time I know I hit a guy

1491
01:40:53.52 --> 01:40:58.76
For a fact is that often that when we came off the choppers and did that okay corail thing

1492
01:40:58.76 --> 01:41:06.32
Yeah, well, then me and another guy went around the before the squad continued moving by we wanted to check out the back, you know

1493
01:41:06.72 --> 01:41:14.04
So he and I go with walking around and he had a car. He was a corpsman and I saw him walk around the edge and fire about three times

1494
01:41:14.04 --> 01:41:16.04
I step by he missed the guy

1495
01:41:16.04 --> 01:41:21.64
And here's this guy with an 847 right about here and I stepped around with my 60 point right at him, you know

1496
01:41:21.64 --> 01:41:28.58
And I just flipped him. Yeah, I think we're going up and went kept going and then three guys popped up out of the rice

1497
01:41:28.58 --> 01:41:35.72
Tyken one they started shooting at us and we were shooting back, but a sea wolf was coming right over us and three rounds

1498
01:41:35.72 --> 01:41:39.20
Right through the instrument panel on the sea wolf didn't hit anybody

1499
01:41:39.20 --> 01:41:42.44
They turned like this and we got had a mini gun and just went oh

1500
01:41:42.44 --> 01:41:46.92
And we just dropped down because it was fucking rounds going everywhere

1501
01:41:48.60 --> 01:41:55.86
Yeah, that's that the amount of fire fights you got you're getting it to take no casualties. Yeah, we didn't that's amazing. No, that's amazing

1502
01:41:56.68 --> 01:42:02.36
That's incredible and we didn't have a lot of pictures either because we didn't have a professional photographer walking around with the

1503
01:42:03.44 --> 01:42:09.56
Yeah, I mean it's a we missed I would say in Ramadi we missed the real

1504
01:42:09.56 --> 01:42:18.52
Like a couple deployments later maybe a year later when guys were going on deployments then pictures everything because they had helmet cams and they had all this stuff

1505
01:42:18.52 --> 01:42:22.68
And we didn't and as a matter of fact at that time there was like rules against taking pictures

1506
01:42:22.68 --> 01:42:27.84
So we don't have a bunch of pictures. Yeah, we did we never and both potuins I was in we took one

1507
01:42:28.40 --> 01:42:31.48
just before we deployed you know the whole platoon and then

1508
01:42:32.84 --> 01:42:37.80
hardly nothing else after that we wouldn't let photographer's close to us we wouldn't let

1509
01:42:37.80 --> 01:42:39.80
But

1510
01:42:39.80 --> 01:42:45.000
News people even come close. We're not in the mean space in where they couldn't get on it. It was perfect and we just

1511
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:51.76
Yeah, we just went on dinner thing had a good time and didn't beat no drums about it. You know to me. It was it was good

1512
01:42:53.24 --> 01:42:58.38
There was a couple of platoons that had a photographer with him that took a lot of pictures and she had new probably

1513
01:42:58.92 --> 01:43:01.48
You probably seen them in the substance, you know

1514
01:43:02.04 --> 01:43:06.52
We didn't the there's platoon as well for in Iraq there was platoon's it got in trouble

1515
01:43:06.52 --> 01:43:09.80
That's one of the reasons why we didn't take pictures because there was platoons that had pictures

1516
01:43:10.68 --> 01:43:17.24
That got exposed and got released and they were shooting their pictures. They shouldn't have taken and they got trouble and it

1517
01:43:17.24 --> 01:43:21.80
You know not just that they got in trouble, but it was bad press bad press for America, you know

1518
01:43:22.04 --> 01:43:24.44
And that's why there was rules. It's like hey no pictures

1519
01:43:24.44 --> 01:43:26.44
So we don't have a lot of pictures of women right now

1520
01:43:26.44 --> 01:43:30.20
You can do a hundred things right and you do one thing wrong and that's what's gonna pop up

1521
01:43:30.20 --> 01:43:34.60
Yeah, and you do one thing wrong and you take a picture of it. That's and these days

1522
01:43:34.60 --> 01:43:39.28
You know that picture's going around the world in in 30 seconds. Yeah, so it's

1523
01:43:39.96 --> 01:43:43.88
The desk one thing that is definitely changed and it and like I said when we're in the body

1524
01:43:43.88 --> 01:43:47.56
We were just on the like I don't think people were really on social media yet

1525
01:43:47.88 --> 01:43:52.12
That we know not everybody had a camera and not everybody

1526
01:43:52.20 --> 01:43:56.76
You know had a video can these guys got video cameras now they got helmet cams they got all the stuff and

1527
01:43:57.08 --> 01:44:00.64
You know some of it's good some of it's better. First of all, I mean you're not gonna get any better intel

1528
01:44:00.64 --> 01:44:05.52
There was a company commander from the first the 506 who was one of the best guys I've ever worked with

1529
01:44:05.68 --> 01:44:10.74
But he video taped every time he went out on patrol in a Humvee or or not in a Humvee

1530
01:44:10.74 --> 01:44:16.96
However, he was going on patrol. He filmed the whole thing and he was working in one specific district of Ramadi called the Moolob district and

1531
01:44:17.96 --> 01:44:22.44
He would come back and watch those videos and he would just and I sat there and watch them with him one time

1532
01:44:22.44 --> 01:44:27.44
And he was yeah, you see this garbage can over here. Yeah, this this one's a good landmark because it's a different color

1533
01:44:27.44 --> 01:44:32.80
And then up on this street corn right here. This this this this poll is always filled with so many wires

1534
01:44:32.80 --> 01:44:35.60
It always scares me, you know because there's so many wires hanging off it

1535
01:44:35.60 --> 01:44:40.72
And he just had the whole city memorized because he had a camera rolling and his home feed the whole time and

1536
01:44:41.44 --> 01:44:47.24
For so for that reason plus when you gather intel, you know, you're going into a building and and you got pictures of everything

1537
01:44:47.24 --> 01:44:50.000
You got if anyone ever goes in that building and you hear it. Oh, here you go

1538
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.48
Well, here's what it's laid out. So there's some definite benefits to it

1539
01:44:52.64 --> 01:44:57.20
But yeah, there's some real drawbacks as well if you know for people

1540
01:44:57.20 --> 01:45:03.30
Can use that stuff for propaganda against you or if your videotape and things or your recording things that are gonna make you know

1541
01:45:03.30 --> 01:45:07.92
The Americans look bad and now you're saying okay. You did this well

1542
01:45:08.48 --> 01:45:12.08
Here's what was happening in the situation here's why this happened and

1543
01:45:13.08 --> 01:45:17.84
Here's the context well the context isn't gonna make it on to YouTube the only thing that's gonna make it on to YouTube

1544
01:45:17.84 --> 01:45:20.000
Is the thing that makes America look bad and that's what's gonna

1545
01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.96
So that's what the reporters are gonna key on

1546
01:45:22.96 --> 01:45:28.24
We got everything yeah see we had barn dance files. I tell you about that. You did mention them yeah

1547
01:45:28.24 --> 01:45:32.52
Barn dance files where this every time you went on an op and you came back

1548
01:45:33.32 --> 01:45:40.18
The guy was Tony was our intel guy or first class and we he'd fill out these barn dance cards

1549
01:45:40.18 --> 01:45:43.32
Why they call them barn dance? That's just the pro word for whatever

1550
01:45:43.48 --> 01:45:47.32
But if they had the who wear what and why's equipment anything?

1551
01:45:47.32 --> 01:45:54.76
We found out there what fire fights we got into what what the enemy were using anything that would be good

1552
01:45:54.76 --> 01:45:57.60
Intel and just a five by four by five card

1553
01:45:57.60 --> 01:46:03.32
But it was really good and every pertune like our the platoon we relieved already had theirs

1554
01:46:03.32 --> 01:46:09.80
So if we were going back into a specific area that that went into we had it organized

1555
01:46:09.80 --> 01:46:16.12
We'd look it up caught up read and see what they hit and what they got and all that stuff and that would be help us out

1556
01:46:16.12 --> 01:46:20.68
When we were going on and we'd when it did a briefs and stuff and we do the same thing

1557
01:46:20.68 --> 01:46:27.08
But every platoon would have these barn dance files of what they did and the areas they went into and stuff

1558
01:46:27.08 --> 01:46:30.20
And it was pretty good, you know, that's how we did it. You know, that's uh

1559
01:46:30.44 --> 01:46:36.04
We didn't do the camera recorded like this and but we anything that we saw that would be a venture

1560
01:46:36.04 --> 01:46:40.84
So another patrol or another platoon going into that area then we'd let them know you know

1561
01:46:40.84 --> 01:46:45.08
See the barn dance files and then like you said when we got to

1562
01:46:45.08 --> 01:46:49.08
Doong Tam Vinlong Province

1563
01:46:49.88 --> 01:46:57.48
What did it split us up into provinces or districts in that province and then we would go out

1564
01:46:57.96 --> 01:47:04.42
Whether a kick-karts and scalts are interpreter and gather intel from the PSP guys

1565
01:47:04.42 --> 01:47:11.24
The chiefs are from the SF that were out in the field in door Rangers that were doing fire bases and stuff like that

1566
01:47:11.24 --> 01:47:18.28
And bring that back and then we would put it up on our sit map and start working, you know, like we had this one

1567
01:47:19.56 --> 01:47:25.000
We knew through our our province at this one VCI which is your high level guy

1568
01:47:25.08 --> 01:47:30.70
They wouldn't transmit communication wise. They would bring your orders in and packets

1569
01:47:30.70 --> 01:47:33.80
You know what I'm saying and he would come through the province maybe

1570
01:47:34.84 --> 01:47:36.04
Once a month

1571
01:47:36.04 --> 01:47:41.92
With all the different information that he was handed to the VC what they wanted to hit and stuff

1572
01:47:41.92 --> 01:47:45.16
But he had all this stuff we knew he came through there every time

1573
01:47:45.16 --> 01:47:50.76
But there were three different trails that he used because we'd gotten intel we didn't know which one it was

1574
01:47:50.76 --> 01:47:56.10
So so we went out on the one trail did an ambush waxing people and shed like that

1575
01:47:56.24 --> 01:48:02.28
So we knew next time he came he wasn't gonna do that trail and then we did the same thing on the other trail right?

1576
01:48:02.28 --> 01:48:08.60
Yeah, so we figured he's gonna come down this trail so we set up on him got him he came down that trail

1577
01:48:08.60 --> 01:48:11.12
We got him got some good intel. That's beautiful

1578
01:48:11.28 --> 01:48:16.92
But that was just working with actionable intel trying to figure it out and and working it you know

1579
01:48:16.92 --> 01:48:22.12
So yeah, work out real good. We want that up always heard about this up where

1580
01:48:23.40 --> 01:48:28.56
They wanted to get this one VCI and they ended up hitting like his

1581
01:48:28.56 --> 01:48:33.72
His family or some member of his family and then when they went to the feet when they had the funeral

1582
01:48:33.72 --> 01:48:38.16
They wouldn't got the guy that they wouldn't know I wouldn't on that there's a lot of things that happened and

1583
01:48:39.04 --> 01:48:43.96
Like you say when you're in your platoon that's kind of your world and that stuff and I've heard of

1584
01:48:43.96 --> 01:48:49.28
I don't remember hearing about that, but I probably was one time and the trade wins the bar

1585
01:48:49.28 --> 01:48:56.08
We used to drink that corn out of or something I'm sure that that was brought up like guy used to hit tax collectors and get their

1586
01:48:56.08 --> 01:49:01.60
PAS to from their money and then they would turn turn that into NPC and

1587
01:49:02.56 --> 01:49:08.08
Stuff you know just different things. Yeah guys we're gonna get a collector because that's a good thing

1588
01:49:08.08 --> 01:49:10.08
You know I support

1589
01:49:10.08 --> 01:49:16.32
Yeah, yeah, a whole bag full of money. Well. Oh well, you know, yeah, no, that's that's awesome

1590
01:49:16.88 --> 01:49:20.16
That's and it's all another thing that people

1591
01:49:20.96 --> 01:49:25.44
You know, it's all self-generated so much of it is self-generated like what you're talking about it's the same thing for us

1592
01:49:25.44 --> 01:49:28.000
I mean I had an intel group but my intel group was

1593
01:49:29.04 --> 01:49:36.48
Seals some intel seals and some intel guys and they created all of our intel and you know our guys fed into it and so we

1594
01:49:36.96 --> 01:49:41.36
Produced our own targets kind of like what you're saying yeah people have this thought that you know

1595
01:49:41.92 --> 01:49:46.72
That the assault force is sitting there waiting for some command to come down and go hit this target

1596
01:49:46.72 --> 01:49:50.32
But it really is we're making up the targets. We're figuring them out ourselves most of the time

1597
01:49:50.32 --> 01:49:55.36
Yeah, well, I can see the difference from my first platoon or we didn't have anything and my second

1598
01:49:55.36 --> 01:50:00.96
Platoon where we actually worked off of actually an actionable intel that we got it was like night and day

1599
01:50:00.96 --> 01:50:06.96
I would do it's a whole different world and just like we talked about before we started this you know you got your fine

1600
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.12
You got your fix and then you got your finish and

1601
01:50:11.12 --> 01:50:17.28
Exploitation of you know what I mean, but that we're the best in the world. I think on d-a stuff the finish

1602
01:50:17.92 --> 01:50:23.28
But you can't do the the finish if you don't have the fine where you know what to go and have you know

1603
01:50:23.28 --> 01:50:28.08
I mean and that's why long time ago we start up that field craft and all that it was stuff but

1604
01:50:29.60 --> 01:50:31.60
We are prudevisors

1605
01:50:32.32 --> 01:50:34.96
We had a training side up in queer macca

1606
01:50:35.28 --> 01:50:40.72
You know we called to advanced training and it was for our prudevisors because they would go over there by themselves

1607
01:50:40.72 --> 01:50:43.76
Yeah, oh with one of their Americans and have about

1608
01:50:44.32 --> 01:50:45.68
50 VC

1609
01:50:45.68 --> 01:50:53.04
Whatever that they were in charge of and the prude's actually were for when the CIA would could collect intel

1610
01:50:53.28 --> 01:50:55.28
But they didn't have a

1611
01:50:55.28 --> 01:51:01.92
Method of going out and hitting it, you know, reacting on doing the finished part of it so that's when they started the pruprogram

1612
01:51:01.92 --> 01:51:04.16
Right, and that's what we have for what provincial

1613
01:51:04.64 --> 01:51:10.64
Prevention recon units right is what they were called prudes we come prudes like you say if I throw out an accuracy

1614
01:51:10.64 --> 01:51:14.40
Yeah, no, I'm just making sure that's just so used you know anyway

1615
01:51:14.40 --> 01:51:20.08
And they would post select guys to go through this prude training and ease close guys too and

1616
01:51:20.64 --> 01:51:26.88
Then they would go over and work and you said they'd be in charge you said VC but you did mean that

1617
01:51:26.88 --> 01:51:35.20
X VC X VC yeah, not not the act that guys at two avoidin stuff and decide they want to make money, you know, I mean so mercenaries is what they were and

1618
01:51:37.52 --> 01:51:38.88
So they had that

1619
01:51:38.88 --> 01:51:45.20
To do you homine trade does it mean turn coat what is a two-hoise a guy that yeah, you left the

1620
01:51:45.76 --> 01:51:48.56
The life of the city and went to the south

1621
01:51:48.56 --> 01:51:54.08
Do you know what two-hoi actually means? No, I don't the actual noun of it. No, yeah, it's a good it was

1622
01:51:54.08 --> 01:51:57.52
I they'd put him in this camp and like when we went to Don Cam

1623
01:51:58.16 --> 01:52:01.44
We went to that camp with our interpreter, but we just haven't have a

1624
01:52:02.48 --> 01:52:07.12
Special both guy at the time MST we call them mobile support team not SPU

1625
01:52:07.12 --> 01:52:13.92
That spoke fluent Vietnamese so we'd bring him with us when our interpreter didn't realize this guy could speak

1626
01:52:14.24 --> 01:52:20.40
Vietnamese too and then we'd start interrogating guys for our district that we're in, you know

1627
01:52:20.40 --> 01:52:24.72
For myself or then along where the guys were and we would

1628
01:52:25.28 --> 01:52:30.72
Talk to him interrogate him and stuff and they sounded like they were good to go then we'd bring him in his kick-harsons

1629
01:52:30.72 --> 01:52:35.68
Scouts they would stay with us we'd let him go and stuff at any time we had an off the state with us

1630
01:52:35.68 --> 01:52:39.52
Until the office done and stuff you know what I mean? They we just didn't let him go

1631
01:52:39.52 --> 01:52:41.92
But they turned out that they were great guys and

1632
01:52:42.72 --> 01:52:44.16
Anyway the

1633
01:52:44.16 --> 01:52:46.16
Proof program was about

1634
01:52:46.72 --> 01:52:50.56
six months long and half of it was three-co-half half of it was medical

1635
01:52:50.96 --> 01:52:56.000
Because you had to have that when you're working out there the medical especially because you're on your own out there

1636
01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.80
You know and you got to be able to take care of yourself if you get it and

1637
01:52:59.60 --> 01:53:04.32
And then they would come over but these guys would also if they got done like

1638
01:53:04.32 --> 01:53:06.32
For going to another platoon

1639
01:53:06.48 --> 01:53:09.20
It would be able to get that is

1640
01:53:09.84 --> 01:53:13.76
Everything he did but we had about seven guys at our six guys

1641
01:53:14.48 --> 01:53:16.08
It was one of them that went to a

1642
01:53:17.12 --> 01:53:22.24
Special school like camp Perry, but it wasn't camp air as different as a shorter version

1643
01:53:22.48 --> 01:53:26.88
And they got that training and they're the ones that were the category for that set and

1644
01:53:26.88 --> 01:53:34.08
Like my lab first platoon in 69 my whole platoon went through most of that before we deployed over

1645
01:53:34.16 --> 01:53:39.20
So you get all that stuff we didn't get the fieldcraft portion of it, but they had some great

1646
01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
really good

1647
01:53:42.64 --> 01:53:46.96
Quick kill trails and stuff like that and that would encompass everything you know to me

1648
01:53:46.96 --> 01:53:49.76
Yeah, and we're lucky because of platoon every once a while

1649
01:53:49.76 --> 01:53:52.88
They didn't have guys going through it build to pick that up and go through it

1650
01:53:52.88 --> 01:53:57.92
But that was the superb training. I mean really good, you know, yeah, that's yeah

1651
01:53:57.92 --> 01:54:02.96
All boys back in training all the yeah, and that's one of that's one of the best things about the seal teams

1652
01:54:02.96 --> 01:54:05.52
But they called it to advance training for sat training

1653
01:54:06.32 --> 01:54:08.32
Specifically for the

1654
01:54:08.32 --> 01:54:10.96
Pervasion recon units that they sent the guys over to

1655
01:54:12.32 --> 01:54:19.44
So when you got back from that deployment of Vietnam now like I said that was November platoon was the last full deployment of two Vietnam

1656
01:54:19.44 --> 01:54:23.76
And you now you know the wars kind of over

1657
01:54:24.32 --> 01:54:28.16
But but you stayed in the teams did you go right to buzz them in?

1658
01:54:28.72 --> 01:54:33.12
Yeah, so I get these orders to the MTV space. I thought what's the ship?

1659
01:54:33.60 --> 01:54:36.48
Because that's when the dirty 30 was happy. No, that's the way

1660
01:54:37.20 --> 01:54:41.84
Explain the 30 30 to people now dirty 30 is where after the war

1661
01:54:42.24 --> 01:54:44.80
We had too many people and they wanted to cut us down

1662
01:54:44.80 --> 01:54:51.12
So even though guys just got out of training stuff they picked 30 guys to go out to the fleet be divers

1663
01:54:51.76 --> 01:54:56.72
EOD and stuff like that and after two years they could come back or whatever and it was just sucked

1664
01:54:56.72 --> 01:55:03.52
It was just one of the low points. I think of the teams magic just made your made it through buzz and

1665
01:55:03.92 --> 01:55:09.52
Or unity training whatever they call it back then I might have been buds and next thing you know you're you know

1666
01:55:09.52 --> 01:55:11.60
You're going to dive school or somewhere

1667
01:55:11.60 --> 01:55:14.80
I went over to and that was really pissed I went over to

1668
01:55:16.16 --> 01:55:17.60
to

1669
01:55:17.68 --> 01:55:22.48
Buds as a instructor land warfare was a third phase. No, that's shit, but

1670
01:55:23.92 --> 01:55:28.80
They still had LDNN program going on then which is where

1671
01:55:31.20 --> 01:55:34.48
You know gotten his action some other guys did now

1672
01:55:34.48 --> 01:55:41.44
I want to stay there and still do the LDNN but I think I don't know I just was one selected go to Buds

1673
01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:47.76
Then when I got down the buds that went back to team one how long were you a buds instructor just two years

1674
01:55:48.80 --> 01:55:52.96
And then you go back to team one I was there again for about seven years and

1675
01:55:53.28 --> 01:55:55.28
Talk about three or four platoon you know what I mean

1676
01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:02.72
When when you see buds now because you still are in the community is there any major difference that you notice

1677
01:56:02.72 --> 01:56:05.52
between what you went through and what you see now

1678
01:56:07.28 --> 01:56:12.08
A lot more land warfare now. Yeah, I think the kids get trained better. There's so much mortal learn

1679
01:56:12.64 --> 01:56:17.44
I don't know half our class probably we're flunked just academically with what the guys got to know now

1680
01:56:17.44 --> 01:56:20.56
I sort of got we're a frog band. It was you know

1681
01:56:20.88 --> 01:56:24.88
Wasn't that hard but now with all the calm and everything those guys go

1682
01:56:24.88 --> 01:56:27.44
Are they teaching that stuff in buds they teach common buds

1683
01:56:27.44 --> 01:56:33.36
They teach some of it. Yeah, not all of it some of it and they a lot of IEDs

1684
01:56:33.36 --> 01:56:38.16
When I go out to saying convenience if I guess they do maybe they don't maybe that's more in

1685
01:56:38.56 --> 01:56:45.60
Ask you to keep it now. They got to use radios and shit there and buds, but it's just a it's the mixture between what we did next

1686
01:56:45.76 --> 01:56:47.76
QT and

1687
01:56:47.76 --> 01:56:53.04
What was the frog band but I think the frog man part of it the unity part of it is kind of really

1688
01:56:53.04 --> 01:56:59.52
Slapped off. I think they do a few cursory parallel perpendicular recon's and stuff like that

1689
01:56:59.52 --> 01:57:05.92
But when I went through we were in that fucking water. So cold. Nobody always said you know that's it

1690
01:57:07.20 --> 01:57:09.20
You earned your wetsuit

1691
01:57:09.20 --> 01:57:16.56
And it was the full wetsuit. It was just the uh well that's for sure. Yeah, that was the same with me. We had we had the old wetsuits with beaver tails

1692
01:57:16.56 --> 01:57:22.72
And we even when I went through this is 1991 right and so it's not like you couldn't get a decent good

1693
01:57:22.88 --> 01:57:26.88
Surfing wetsuit because I surfed and I knew what a good sweatsuit was so they gave me that shitty

1694
01:57:28.08 --> 01:57:33.76
Wet suit with the beaver tail with the big zipper a big loose open it looked like a 1970s disco

1695
01:57:33.76 --> 01:57:37.04
There's so much water going through that thing. It was almost not worth whenever well

1696
01:57:37.60 --> 01:57:39.60
We we our first swim

1697
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Was in ED keys

1698
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:47.04
And no fans or nothing you earned your fans go yeah, wetsuit appreciation

1699
01:57:47.04 --> 01:57:52.64
Yeah, they had they called it wetsuit appreciation and then they fit appreciation also to get your fans too

1700
01:57:52.72 --> 01:57:57.12
You know, and then we got our fans and we still did a couple of swims without the wetsuit

1701
01:57:57.12 --> 01:58:00.32
And we got our wetsuit. I mean it was like Jesus Christ

1702
01:58:01.36 --> 01:58:06.56
Everybody always says yeah, you know mine cold water do you and I says I've hated cold water all my life

1703
01:58:07.12 --> 01:58:09.52
It's just part of her job and it's what you do you know them

1704
01:58:09.52 --> 01:58:14.80
Yeah, you only get wet once. Yeah, that's the time like you know what you just oh you're gonna get wet

1705
01:58:14.80 --> 01:58:17.28
You could just get wet one time and then doesn't matter anymore

1706
01:58:17.84 --> 01:58:23.76
But the I mean in there's certain things that I don't think if change like there's always been a 5.5 nautical miles one

1707
01:58:23.84 --> 01:58:29.04
Yeah, right that I don't think that's gotten any shorter. I don't think that that just is what it is a lot of the standards of state

1708
01:58:29.04 --> 01:58:31.04
the same physically and

1709
01:58:32.32 --> 01:58:33.84
It

1710
01:58:33.84 --> 01:58:42.64
Flex weights a little bit. I think about who's the director over buds and how many times they roll people back and then thing back in the day

1711
01:58:42.64 --> 01:58:44.16
I mean if a guy

1712
01:58:44.16 --> 01:58:48.88
Was it got dropped or something he was gone never saw me. Yeah, he was just he was out of there

1713
01:58:48.88 --> 01:58:50.88
You know it wasn't come back later

1714
01:58:50.88 --> 01:58:52.88
Maybe they did after a couple of years

1715
01:58:52.88 --> 01:58:54.88
Yeah, I'm like we had a guy in our class name

1716
01:58:56.64 --> 01:59:00.96
He didn't been in class 37. I think and he had broke his hip and

1717
01:59:00.96 --> 01:59:04.24
And then he was in my class and he made it you know what I mean

1718
01:59:06.24 --> 01:59:08.24
Really got hyper for me a band

1719
01:59:09.76 --> 01:59:15.60
There was a guy in my class that had rolled back his Jeff eggs as a matter of fact

1720
01:59:15.60 --> 01:59:20.80
Who's a jitter guy, but he had hyper for him. They dropped him for hyper for me and he wouldn't

1721
01:59:22.08 --> 01:59:23.36
So

1722
01:59:23.36 --> 01:59:29.20
They told me he's out they're like you're done. Hey man, listen you're a great guy, but you can't you can't be in the program anymore

1723
01:59:29.20 --> 01:59:32.88
Because you just get hyper for me. It's too easy and he's like no, I'm not leaving and

1724
01:59:33.76 --> 01:59:37.60
They gave him his dung a raiseback which is like the regular navy thing that you wear

1725
01:59:37.60 --> 01:59:43.52
You know and he showed up with the glass on Monday with his dung a reason just pt and with the glass in the compound

1726
01:59:43.52 --> 01:59:46.96
And they looked at him and they're like all right, we'll give this bastard another shot

1727
01:59:46.96 --> 01:59:50.24
That's how good yeah, he was a he's a hard dude. He made it through

1728
01:59:50.24 --> 01:59:53.28
But you know hyper through me is a lot like a he did

1729
01:59:54.88 --> 01:59:57.60
Exhaust you when you get it that the heat thing yeah

1730
01:59:57.60 --> 01:59:59.60
It'll come back and bite you

1731
01:59:59.60 --> 02:00:01.44
You know really does I mean I sort of got it

1732
02:00:01.44 --> 02:00:04.24
Hyper for me is like that too. Yeah, if you get a roll bad case

1733
02:00:04.24 --> 02:00:07.60
I knew it's like that with heat exhaustion, but I know it's like that with hyper for me

1734
02:00:07.60 --> 02:00:12.80
I think it is. I mean maybe I'm wrong. Yeah, I'm just you're that's what I heard so I don't know well

1735
02:00:12.80 --> 02:00:16.88
I'm lucky because I've always been pretty well marbled in terms of insulation

1736
02:00:18.32 --> 02:00:20.32
This was really skinny lean dude

1737
02:00:20.32 --> 02:00:24.48
I was found out if you swim as hard as you can you usually stay warm in your house

1738
02:00:24.48 --> 02:00:29.12
That's a good boy. I don't like threaten water and cold water, you know, like that's

1739
02:00:29.12 --> 02:00:33.60
Fumurlin I was telling you about that was that was painful God almighty that was cold

1740
02:00:34.40 --> 02:00:40.48
And I told you when we first got to buds they had us go down to 401 and gave us a talk

1741
02:00:40.48 --> 02:00:46.24
You know the guy left you and right here won't be there it's easier to pass a marshmallow through the keyhole of a needle

1742
02:00:46.48 --> 02:00:51.28
Then make it through and roll go in yeah, whatever and so they march just so back in front of the bay

1743
02:00:51.28 --> 02:00:53.68
You know, I told you around the bay side and that

1744
02:00:53.68 --> 02:00:58.08
The guys tell you about come walking around you kind of look at us working like you know

1745
02:00:58.08 --> 02:01:02.48
Yeah, how tough can this be and everything and he said about face

1746
02:01:03.28 --> 02:01:06.96
Forward march and march just all of their dress blues right in the water

1747
02:01:07.20 --> 02:01:13.84
So you got your flaps stick around like this all the white hats floating and the officer's had and kind of looked at each other when God damn

1748
02:01:14.16 --> 02:01:18.96
This may not be that easy and went downhill from there. You know, that sucks

1749
02:01:18.96 --> 02:01:24.96
Yeah, that sucks that's difficult

1750
02:01:26.80 --> 02:01:31.36
So you got done you got done with being a buds instructor you went back and you did a bunch of people how many

1751
02:01:31.36 --> 02:01:34.000
Poutunes did you do back and did overall nine

1752
02:01:34.56 --> 02:01:39.12
Yeah, that's not that many but it mean it was good actually that is a lot for anyone that's listening to a nine

1753
02:01:39.12 --> 02:01:44.16
But there's a lot because that's nine Poutunes with workups. Yeah, that's like 20 years worth of work right there

1754
02:01:45.84 --> 02:01:47.12
And

1755
02:01:47.12 --> 02:01:50.24
And then you know how to story about you and

1756
02:01:51.60 --> 02:01:53.84
You got into a fight with some guy at Nyland

1757
02:01:54.96 --> 02:01:56.96
Oh, yeah

1758
02:01:56.96 --> 02:01:58.96
Yeah, this is like

1759
02:01:58.96 --> 02:02:03.68
You got into a fight with some guy at night. Oh, no, that wasn't that was this guy that was just out of prison

1760
02:02:03.68 --> 02:02:05.68
That's the one yeah, so I'd hear in

1761
02:02:06.32 --> 02:02:08.48
About six six yeah, yeah, somehow

1762
02:02:09.28 --> 02:02:13.04
You know, I heard the story from my Poutune chief and he said yeah

1763
02:02:13.04 --> 02:02:20.96
He said Roger he's a tough as best for life and I said it was yeah one time route at Nyland and there's some guy in a bar and he's

1764
02:02:21.28 --> 02:02:26.000
Whatever something happens and you guys throw down and apparently you guys had like a legit

1765
02:02:26.72 --> 02:02:29.12
Like five maybe ten minute fight

1766
02:02:29.12 --> 02:02:31.76
It was terrible. Yeah, so I

1767
02:02:32.08 --> 02:02:36.72
Walked in the barn. I'm just sitting there and he is a song kept playing this Western

1768
02:02:36.72 --> 02:02:41.44
She rides this out of the little and that it on a fun. I asked the bartender got damn

1769
02:02:41.44 --> 02:02:43.44
Can you play a different song?

1770
02:02:43.44 --> 02:02:47.04
Guy turns it off and this great big guy stands up like he said he'd

1771
02:02:47.92 --> 02:02:50.32
blonde hair about six four I think

1772
02:02:51.44 --> 02:02:57.44
Let's just look you know the steel blue eyes and stuff and how come you turn that off and a bartender pointed right to me

1773
02:02:57.44 --> 02:03:02.72
Well, he said they turned it off and then the guy looks at me and I went I don't want to fight

1774
02:03:03.36 --> 02:03:09.04
You know, yeah, just you just don't get in fights them so I started walking out the door going across the other bar

1775
02:03:09.04 --> 02:03:14.000
Which is right across the street like he wouldn't have followed me so he follows me out the door

1776
02:03:15.36 --> 02:03:19.12
And I turned and looked at him and I said now he's gonna follow me over there

1777
02:03:19.12 --> 02:03:24.000
We're probably one of fighting so I jumped on one foot twice and hitting him as hard as I could

1778
02:03:24.88 --> 02:03:28.24
Right in the jaw knocked him down just hit went like this and

1779
02:03:28.88 --> 02:03:33.68
And hit the wall and some of it stood right back up and I went holy shit

1780
02:03:33.68 --> 02:03:40.72
You know anyway we did about a 10 minute fighting he actually never hit me one time because I just I wasn't really good

1781
02:03:40.72 --> 02:03:46.24
Shaping out nylon yeah running in and you know to mean and so finally we squirre off again, you know

1782
02:03:46.24 --> 02:03:50.24
And I look at him. He looks at me and you know, I'm covered blood, but it's his blood drip

1783
02:03:50.24 --> 02:03:54.88
But I mean because I just kept you know point if the guy had ever hit me hit a kill me

1784
02:03:55.28 --> 02:03:58.000
He was fighting for fun. I was fighting for my life

1785
02:03:58.72 --> 02:04:02.32
That's the deal so we squirre off again and finally I went

1786
02:04:02.32 --> 02:04:08.64
We can I'm not tired yet and we can keep on fighting or we can go across the street to have a bear and he thought about it

1787
02:04:08.64 --> 02:04:13.28
He says well let's go have a bear put his arm around me. You're pretty tough for a little guy

1788
02:04:14.24 --> 02:04:15.60
And I'm almost crying

1789
02:04:15.60 --> 02:04:17.60
Yeah, I've got thank God

1790
02:04:18.32 --> 02:04:20.96
That's probably the toughest fight of every bending that guy was a

1791
02:04:21.68 --> 02:04:26.72
Jesus and then I found out he'd been in prison. Yeah, that's what he did his weight lifting box

1792
02:04:26.72 --> 02:04:30.24
And he was in prison. Yeah, that's how I got out of that. Oh never know man

1793
02:04:30.24 --> 02:04:34.72
I was the punch line was that dude just got out of prison. It was a weight lifting a box that got box

1794
02:04:34.72 --> 02:04:37.68
Yeah, that was uh that was a that was a worn out

1795
02:04:38.40 --> 02:04:43.36
Yeah, a few moments of excitement and that one and then you uh you became a worn officer

1796
02:04:43.84 --> 02:04:46.80
Yeah, I was a master chief. I was a master chief of group one

1797
02:04:47.60 --> 02:04:53.68
And that was all I was gonna do after that wasn't gonna go to work on everything and that's when they came out with a worn program

1798
02:04:54.24 --> 02:04:56.64
So I put him for war and went war and then

1799
02:04:56.64 --> 02:05:01.28
deployed the desert storm came back and then uh we started the

1800
02:05:02.56 --> 02:05:06.88
That special program I was in that did that for about a year year and a half and they

1801
02:05:07.68 --> 02:05:13.52
But nevelin so of work on me cited we didn't need that anymore so they took us all and put us into

1802
02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
run the first

1803
02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:22.80
SKT for group one instead of having at the teams and then we did that and then I went from that to

1804
02:05:22.80 --> 02:05:28.16
uh start doing all our ease. It's awesome. I'll send you step two or you put when I was in my second

1805
02:05:28.16 --> 02:05:29.36
Platoon

1806
02:05:29.36 --> 02:05:33.44
All the guys that all of our new guys went through your uh your SKT yeah

1807
02:05:33.76 --> 02:05:38.40
We've been going for like two hours right now just um I want to get one more question

1808
02:05:39.28 --> 02:05:40.48
Some some people

1809
02:05:40.48 --> 02:05:45.12
Listen to the podcast that want to go in the sealed teams and

1810
02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
You know any sort of

1811
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:53.68
Thought on what they should be thinking about when they're trying to get in or trying to go fast me all the time

1812
02:05:53.84 --> 02:06:01.20
You know I would say real simple stuff you know like hey do a bunch of pull ups push ups dips swim run and don't quit and

1813
02:06:01.68 --> 02:06:04.72
And that's how you make it into the sealed teams then when you get into sealed teams you know

1814
02:06:05.92 --> 02:06:11.04
Work your ass off. Well, you know you get all those kids up at the pre-tree and upper grade like you know

1815
02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
physically fit perfect

1816
02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:21.92
And it's the mental thing. It's uh you got to take each day at a time when you get there and if you finish that day

1817
02:06:21.92 --> 02:06:27.04
Be real happy then get the next day and keep going on don't look ahead of what you got to do

1818
02:06:27.04 --> 02:06:29.04
But it's like when I was a

1819
02:06:29.28 --> 02:06:33.52
Second time as a bud structure as a master to arms you know not get all these guys in

1820
02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.72
And I tell them if you want to do everything we want to do and

1821
02:06:37.28 --> 02:06:39.28
Have the easy life go EOD

1822
02:06:39.28 --> 02:06:44.40
If you think you're gonna be a diver and working diver I said go be a diver

1823
02:06:44.64 --> 02:06:47.04
I told him if you want to be cold wet and miserable

1824
02:06:47.76 --> 02:06:49.76
Then going the seals

1825
02:06:49.76 --> 02:06:54.80
But I will say one thing even going through buds and you can probably attest to this

1826
02:06:55.20 --> 02:07:00.48
That just skits you into the teams and then you deploy and that's where you pull

1827
02:07:01.28 --> 02:07:02.80
from what you

1828
02:07:02.80 --> 02:07:07.20
Experience and buds the whether where you have to push yourself to the

1829
02:07:07.20 --> 02:07:09.20
Inth you know like

1830
02:07:10.32 --> 02:07:13.04
They're again two and 69 we were doing this

1831
02:07:14.24 --> 02:07:17.92
When I was with a kilo of a tune we were gonna set up the same boy shown this river

1832
02:07:18.24 --> 02:07:20.72
We had to go through about a click and a half of

1833
02:07:21.92 --> 02:07:24.72
Mangal shit and that's where it was all gray and shit from

1834
02:07:25.28 --> 02:07:27.28
Agent Orange and shit

1835
02:07:27.28 --> 02:07:29.28
I was up to my knees and mud

1836
02:07:29.92 --> 02:07:31.92
up to my waist and water

1837
02:07:31.92 --> 02:07:37.12
And when you're holding your weapon up high enough to keep it out of the water

1838
02:07:37.52 --> 02:07:42.08
And you go for about a click and a half in that shit using just compass because

1839
02:07:42.96 --> 02:07:47.28
There were we didn't have GPS is all that shit and you kept going to your red into the

1840
02:07:47.76 --> 02:07:53.12
Stream or whatever you're gonna set it up on yeah to strain headaches so bad you're fucking ice across

1841
02:07:54.16 --> 02:07:58.96
And you're breathing in mosquitoes in your mouth and spitting them out and shit like that that's uh

1842
02:07:58.96 --> 02:08:00.96
That's

1843
02:08:01.52 --> 02:08:03.04
That's the dad you send back and

1844
02:08:03.68 --> 02:08:08.96
Three bears and pad poopers you know you're good to go or you're in Korean

1845
02:08:09.76 --> 02:08:17.04
In pole hang and you got to hit this target that you got to go over about three mountain ridges because you can't run the ridges and create

1846
02:08:17.04 --> 02:08:19.04
You got to go up and down them and

1847
02:08:19.44 --> 02:08:24.72
Come out of a submarine and land on the beach and it's cold and you're you're kind of covering

1848
02:08:24.72 --> 02:08:31.92
Why one guy's trying to take off his wet suit and he's falling down till he gets it off then then you do it and you get about half way up the first

1849
02:08:32.16 --> 02:08:34.16
Mountain ridges before you start getting warm

1850
02:08:34.40 --> 02:08:40.88
That's when you find out if you if you got or not the bottom line is we complete the mission, you know

1851
02:08:41.60 --> 02:08:46.40
Yeah, that's what we do no matter what but like I say buds hell week all that shit

1852
02:08:46.88 --> 02:08:51.60
Just get you your mind in the right place to know that well god damn I went through hell week

1853
02:08:51.60 --> 02:08:57.20
I can do this you know what I mean yeah another thing's like to five miles away and we know that stuff and that's all

1854
02:08:57.76 --> 02:09:05.28
It's just it's more you I've seen when I was an instructor great big guys ever football players fall out and quit

1855
02:09:05.44 --> 02:09:10.48
And I've seen little skinny guys that you laugh at and thinking this guy's gonna be a seal and he makes it through

1856
02:09:10.72 --> 02:09:13.04
It's all because of appearance mind, you know

1857
02:09:13.68 --> 02:09:17.20
Do you agree I mean that's yeah and and I've always you know

1858
02:09:17.20 --> 02:09:22.80
The buds is screening process and you don't actually learn

1859
02:09:23.60 --> 02:09:28.40
Much in buds it just gets rid of the people that don't want to be there and the real test comes when you

1860
02:09:28.40 --> 02:09:34.16
You know when you get in combat because going into you know being called wet and miserable for two or three or four or five days

1861
02:09:34.16 --> 02:09:38.32
And training and doing a bunch of pushups doesn't compare to what you were just talking about

1862
02:09:38.88 --> 02:09:45.28
You yeah, I think of the sand and yeah, no, that shit that you went through that's yeah. I mean I I don't like the desert

1863
02:09:45.28 --> 02:09:50.96
I don't like coding a mountain and give me the jungle anytime remember my happy camper

1864
02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.24
Yeah, I don't like mosquitoes so I'll take the desert of the mountains but those are the things

1865
02:09:56.80 --> 02:10:02.24
You know you know I always say that I always talk about seeing my guys lined up to go out and

1866
02:10:02.24 --> 02:10:06.64
Remoddy and their their home visa lined up and like if I wasn't going on the hop

1867
02:10:06.64 --> 02:10:09.28
There's just like platoon is going out and I'd stand there

1868
02:10:09.60 --> 02:10:14.000
Just I salute them like as they were leaving you know I just stay out there and salute them as they were rolling out

1869
02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
And

1870
02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.92
What it takes to be the lead turret gunner in the first home v

1871
02:10:20.96 --> 02:10:28.56
Is more than what it takes to get through buds like that guy who knows that there's been you know an ID on the road

1872
02:10:28.56 --> 02:10:36.16
He's about to drive by there's been seven to ten ID's a day on that road and he's the lead turret gunner

1873
02:10:36.16 --> 02:10:40.80
And he's gonna roll out again and he did it the night before and he did it the week before and he did it the night before that

1874
02:10:40.80 --> 02:10:46.48
That's what the test is and you're blessed I remind me of it when I was on that

1875
02:10:47.20 --> 02:10:49.20
Boston way or two

1876
02:10:49.20 --> 02:10:51.68
Where is he he's up at the top right?

1877
02:10:52.88 --> 02:10:58.000
What can people see him? Yeah, you know and he rockets or anything like that

1878
02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
You know where it's gonna go. Yeah

1879
02:11:00.56 --> 02:11:05.52
Yeah, I want to stop that from shooting you know me but just just an example

1880
02:11:05.52 --> 02:11:07.52
I mean like when I was in a subeek would be

1881
02:11:07.52 --> 02:11:11.60
We'd take the in subeek is pretty neat because the

1882
02:11:12.40 --> 02:11:20.32
Topography there was you go from triple canopy jungle down to Mangro to where the lower mow was which was there

1883
02:11:20.88 --> 02:11:24.64
There are a few place and stuff. Why take my guys up to the

1884
02:11:25.68 --> 02:11:32.32
About four or five of them up to the hospital which is up top we'd go down through the triple canopy jungle

1885
02:11:32.32 --> 02:11:38.64
Worker way all the way through spend the night and come in and hit the lower mow so they had triple canopy

1886
02:11:39.20 --> 02:11:45.28
Regular jungle in Mangro of swamp chapa stuff and they were going to just kind of let him know you know

1887
02:11:45.28 --> 02:11:49.92
Yeah, this is what it was like boys. Yeah, that's all that's that's what it's like yeah

1888
02:11:49.92 --> 02:11:54.000
It's like that's why we train hard and to be prepared for that stuff so

1889
02:11:54.72 --> 02:11:58.40
Yeah awesome awesome advice echo speaking of advice

1890
02:11:58.40 --> 02:12:04.80
Sure, do you have any advice on how anyone if they want to maybe support the podcast or support themselves?

1891
02:12:04.80 --> 02:12:07.76
How they could do that sure quickly quick question

1892
02:12:09.44 --> 02:12:13.36
Quick question you mentioned the booby traps like what kind of booby trap?

1893
02:12:13.36 --> 02:12:19.36
What is it like trip wires? Oh God you we were before when we deployed and I don't know if I'll say I think it was

1894
02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:24.48
71 we stopped in Hawaii and went to the EOD booby trap course

1895
02:12:24.48 --> 02:12:31.44
That they had that they'd picked up over the years and Vietnam and set it all up and after we went through that thing

1896
02:12:32.56 --> 02:12:38.000
You didn't you want to go over just about because it was unbelievable but they would do stuff like

1897
02:12:38.96 --> 02:12:43.76
They'd like to use the you guys would call my E.Ds, but they'd be like mortar's up and trees and stuff

1898
02:12:43.76 --> 02:12:47.12
And they'd use different methods like a guinea

1899
02:12:48.40 --> 02:12:50.88
They got he got here with a command detonated

1900
02:12:50.88 --> 02:12:57.76
It might have been a mortar and you're hitting pretty bad, but I bet sometimes they would take

1901
02:12:58.32 --> 02:13:00.32
filament down and put

1902
02:13:01.04 --> 02:13:08.32
Fisher's on it so that you would grab it you wouldn't feel it on the bottom you know and it repuls it off whatever they had set up

1903
02:13:08.32 --> 02:13:11.04
If you use a saw filament line that was just

1904
02:13:11.92 --> 02:13:18.80
Kind of sagging everything you'd go ahead and cut that if it was tight you didn't fuck with it like you see the smart thing to do is the backway

1905
02:13:18.80 --> 02:13:24.80
And come in another direction and the way the arpoint scouts did it. They were really good. They would take a thin

1906
02:13:27.20 --> 02:13:33.44
branch or stick you know real thin like just like when you're fishing you can feel a bite on the line

1907
02:13:33.60 --> 02:13:37.44
They would take that and they would hold it kind of in the center and as we're moving slow

1908
02:13:37.76 --> 02:13:39.28
They'd move at any time that thing

1909
02:13:39.76 --> 02:13:45.28
Dept they had reached out and feel it like a lot of other times if you're going down a trail

1910
02:13:45.28 --> 02:13:53.68
Which isn't a really good idea anyway, but you step over a log sometimes they'd put a pressure detonated stuff over that log if you're stepped on it

1911
02:13:53.68 --> 02:13:58.000
So you'd always want to go to the side just a myriad of things there was a

1912
02:13:59.12 --> 02:14:01.12
who

1913
02:14:01.76 --> 02:14:05.92
A lot of the stuff was command detonated like we were on those river boats

1914
02:14:05.92 --> 02:14:10.80
There was this place called Snoopy's nose, you know and we'd have the boats going like this and one of them

1915
02:14:10.80 --> 02:14:13.84
They would turn one group of boats another group of boats would be here

1916
02:14:13.84 --> 02:14:18.88
And then they would open up on this group of boats so they would shoot across but it wasn't that far

1917
02:14:19.52 --> 02:14:24.40
To the were the other boats where they'd start getting hit and thinking God damn we're being shot at and

1918
02:14:24.88 --> 02:14:27.12
Go back and forth or they would

1919
02:14:27.68 --> 02:14:32.64
Put a B40 rocket then they'd be down here in a spider hole, but they'd have

1920
02:14:35.28 --> 02:14:40.08
Like singing a post little and sticking up and as soon as the boat got right there

1921
02:14:40.08 --> 02:14:44.08
They would hit the command thing rocker would go off and hit the boat everybody

1922
02:14:44.08 --> 02:14:47.12
It opened up here and these guys would be giggling taken off you know what I mean?

1923
02:14:47.68 --> 02:14:54.16
Just you know the the EOD guys that we had nowadays in the sealed teams the guys that come in

1924
02:14:54.16 --> 02:14:56.16
They they go through work up with a very awesome

1925
02:14:56.16 --> 02:15:01.84
You can't you couldn't if someone normal person was watching they wouldn't be able to tell who's the OD and who's not in at least when you're in a

1926
02:15:01.84 --> 02:15:07.60
Remoddy and that's what most of you guys are like but my EOD guys talking about not wanting to go over there

1927
02:15:07.60 --> 02:15:11.92
My EOD guys they would they would put together briefs of like the latest

1928
02:15:12.48 --> 02:15:19.92
The latest ID's that's been out there. This is when we're in Remoddy and you know every couple every maybe like once once every two weeks

1929
02:15:19.92 --> 02:15:21.92
They'd put together more of a detailed

1930
02:15:22.32 --> 02:15:25.20
Brief of like hey, this is what it does. This is this thing and

1931
02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:32.000
What we would do is when someone knew like let's say someone was in from out of town or we had like a visitor

1932
02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
That was gonna go on and off with us

1933
02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:37.76
You know, they'd give that extended brief to teach the guys

1934
02:15:38.32 --> 02:15:41.04
Well, what it actually did was he would just horrify

1935
02:15:44.64 --> 02:15:48.96
Yeah, that was the they had there that became like the joke like you know

1936
02:15:48.96 --> 02:15:55.12
I looked at EOD like I'd see their slide come up and I the initial slide in the brief was I could tell it was the big brief

1937
02:15:55.12 --> 02:15:58.000
And I look over at the person that was going like our guest

1938
02:15:58.16 --> 02:16:03.52
You know, maybe it was like a senior officer someone was gonna come or some intel person that was gonna go out and

1939
02:16:03.52 --> 02:16:08.72
Hop with us and I'd look at the beginning of the EOD brief and you know, they just have a normal look on their face

1940
02:16:08.72 --> 02:16:15.84
The by the end of 22 slides later. They look like they didn't want to go anymore. No, I'd like to see what take these

1941
02:16:19.20 --> 02:16:23.44
Stone things you have water in and stuff right and if you're going through a village

1942
02:16:23.44 --> 02:16:29.44
We didn't do we didn't usually sweep through villages and shit that felt about half it up with gasoline

1943
02:16:29.44 --> 02:16:35.84
And if they knew the Americans had come in and they'd take a grenade wrap up say rigorous tape or something that would

1944
02:16:36.16 --> 02:16:41.28
This is great. That's what drop it in there then as the guys are going through checking out the hooches and everything

1945
02:16:41.28 --> 02:16:45.44
That would go off. I mean like if we were gonna go into a hooch or something

1946
02:16:45.92 --> 02:16:53.20
We would tie a string to the door and then pull the door open everybody would be down or if we saw something

1947
02:16:53.20 --> 02:16:57.36
And then where the steps were going into it sometimes if we weren't hidden it quick

1948
02:16:57.36 --> 02:17:00.32
You know you'd check to see what was under the

1949
02:17:00.88 --> 02:17:05.92
You know me see if there's anything but it's just they were in genius man. They were really evil

1950
02:17:06.48 --> 02:17:11.36
They beat the French and shit. They guys have been fighting for a couple years

1951
02:17:12.64 --> 02:17:20.40
Anyway, go ahead. I'm sorry. Yeah, no, that was it. It's crazy how they get smarter and then you guys get smarter

1952
02:17:20.40 --> 02:17:24.24
We're trying to figure it out and they're like okay, they're trying to figure out this so they get smart game

1953
02:17:24.24 --> 02:17:27.84
And it becomes yeah, that's the game in the game does all start the game. No

1954
02:17:29.44 --> 02:17:35.84
Speaking of being in the game. Okay, like that. I'll do that one to you. You talk to the alphabet today apparently

1955
02:17:37.44 --> 02:17:39.44
Offer brain alpha brain from on it

1956
02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:44.16
I don't think there is any other kind of alpha brain, but nonetheless I did take some and

1957
02:17:44.80 --> 02:17:47.68
We're gonna talk about it not for too long. So anyway

1958
02:17:49.12 --> 02:17:51.12
Supplements supplementation

1959
02:17:51.12 --> 02:17:55.60
So thinking about this. I was taking krill oil actually is when I was thinking about this

1960
02:17:57.20 --> 02:18:00.64
Where would you be if you didn't take any krill oil or any strong bone?

1961
02:18:01.36 --> 02:18:06.16
Where would you be we don't know behind we're not gonna be behind exactly right

1962
02:18:06.72 --> 02:18:11.20
So so it kind of makes me think like okay, you know anyone who's thinking about okay

1963
02:18:11.60 --> 02:18:16.96
Jocco act with they talk about taking krill oil all the time how much it it helps and they didn't start taking it

1964
02:18:16.96 --> 02:18:26.96
You're behind so my recommendation is take the krill oil not to mention the alpha brain not to mention any other supplements that will help you get to where you want to be

1965
02:18:28.72 --> 02:18:30.72
You talk about procrastination sometimes

1966
02:18:31.28 --> 02:18:36.96
Everyone's in a while and that's the biggest thing by definition. It's gonna keep you from doing it

1967
02:18:38.64 --> 02:18:42.24
You know I get on the supplements. That's the point there and if you want to 10% off

1968
02:18:42.24 --> 02:18:49.44
The supplements that we all know are the best supplements go to on it dot com slash jocco boom. There it is

1969
02:18:50.08 --> 02:18:52.08
Support yourself

1970
02:18:52.08 --> 02:19:00.48
Then you can support others and it's worth a podcast boom. There it is also another way to support podcast is Amazon click through which means before you do your Amazon shopping

02:19:24.64 --> 02:19:26.64
educating yourself

1978
02:19:26.64 --> 02:19:34.96
Also subscribe to the podcast on iTunes stitch or Google play all these other podcasting providing platforms

1979
02:19:34.96 --> 02:19:40.88
If you haven't already that's a good way to do it leave review if you didn't in the mood if you're not in the mood then don't do it

1980
02:19:41.52 --> 02:19:47.20
Or you can still do it if you're not in the mood whatever you want also YouTube subscribe to that one

1981
02:19:47.68 --> 02:19:49.44
People have been subscribing. That's good

1982
02:19:51.12 --> 02:19:57.20
It's good because it helps spread the word seems obvious but when you really think about it's not as obvious as you might think

1983
02:19:57.20 --> 02:20:07.84
Because when you get that alert it's not just the whole podcast as we always kind of know it's like little excerpts you know a lot of times or a little bit more artistic

1984
02:20:08.64 --> 02:20:10.16
excerpts

1985
02:20:10.32 --> 02:20:12.80
You'll be more compelled to share those and

1986
02:20:12.96 --> 02:20:17.24
We talk about shareability right when you get when someone shares it with you. That's one thing

1987
02:20:17.24 --> 02:20:20.40
You're like okay, I'll listen to this. It's only two three minutes long, but

1988
02:20:21.04 --> 02:20:24.56
on the reverse side when you when you're about to share it

1989
02:20:24.56 --> 02:20:27.60
You'll be thinking kind of in the other person's mind

1990
02:20:27.60 --> 02:20:30.32
They're more into listening to it because it's shorter

1991
02:20:30.80 --> 02:20:32.80
It's subtle, but there's a difference

1992
02:20:32.80 --> 02:20:36.62
Plenty way if you subscribe boom that'll you'll have it'll have that effect on you as well

1993
02:20:36.62 --> 02:20:39.90
And I'll see you smagic, but it's it's very

1994
02:20:40.36 --> 02:20:43.60
Explanable anyway point there is subscribe to YouTube as a good one

1995
02:20:44.08 --> 02:20:46.72
We'll put more videos on there as well also

1996
02:20:48.52 --> 02:20:51.16
Jocco has a store. It's called Jocco store

1997
02:20:51.16 --> 02:20:55.40
Jocco store.com new rash guard is out straight up

1998
02:20:55.96 --> 02:21:01.76
We did it on the Facebook live. I put it live on there. You were there. I was there. I think it was your Facebook live

1999
02:21:03.12 --> 02:21:05.52
I don't think I've ever done a Facebook live by the way

2000
02:21:07.24 --> 02:21:10.96
Anyway back to the store there's women stuff on there. This t-shirts on there

2001
02:21:11.48 --> 02:21:14.12
You have a t-shirt. Do we we gave you t-shirt right last time?

2002
02:21:14.28 --> 02:21:16.72
Give you another one this stuff too. They're pretty dope

2003
02:21:17.64 --> 02:21:19.64
There's layers

2004
02:21:19.64 --> 02:21:23.08
More to the shirts than then meets the eye where your kid shirt is out

2005
02:21:23.76 --> 02:21:27.40
Where your kid shirts shirts adults and children. Yeah

2006
02:21:28.92 --> 02:21:36.08
Yeah, also jocco uniform. That's what I'm calling it the jocco uniform. Oh this shirt victory MMA and fitness shirt

2007
02:21:36.08 --> 02:21:38.08
You know the actual original

2008
02:21:39.36 --> 02:21:41.36
shirt 100% cotton

2009
02:21:41.56 --> 02:21:43.56
Very soft

2010
02:21:43.56 --> 02:21:47.64
Like how jocco likes it. Anyway from I here. All right. That's what I heard anyway

2011
02:21:47.64 --> 02:21:50.08
A lot of cool stuff on there if you want to support

2012
02:21:50.84 --> 02:21:55.16
Get something there's some patches on there too Velcro patches regulation size

2013
02:21:55.92 --> 02:21:58.56
For the hats actually we got hats coming up too by the way. Oh

2014
02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:07.62
A lot of people they ask you now. They're not out. They're not out. I'm saying why are you even telling them I'm saying because when people make these suggestions and a lot of people start making

2015
02:22:07.62 --> 02:22:09.12
okay

2016
02:22:09.12 --> 02:22:16.64
You know the more people that make them the more we we are likely to begin to think about

2017
02:22:16.64 --> 02:22:23.24
Executing how you make it sound like such a process long process. It's a process because you can't just have like two guys saying hey

2018
02:22:23.24 --> 02:22:28.68
We should get, um, you know, I don't know something earrings or something in another guy's

2019
02:22:28.68 --> 02:22:33.28
Yeah, that's no one other story don't ask oh, so you made my point for me

2020
02:22:33.28 --> 02:22:38.96
So paths were one of those ones where there was a lot of people saying we need a or we should have hats

2021
02:22:38.96 --> 02:22:43.04
That would be cool and people were like yeah, I think that too. So anyway hats are on the way

2022
02:22:43.04 --> 02:22:45.04
I

2023
02:22:45.04 --> 02:22:48.64
Some of these out there I already mentioned the rash guard. I think

2024
02:22:50.32 --> 02:22:52.70
I think we have a lot of good stuff on there, but

2025
02:22:53.10 --> 02:22:59.000
Only way if you're gonna find out is to go to jockelstore.com and find out for yourself if you're in the mood get something like that

2026
02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:02.38
Or get something that's on there and it will support the podcast also

2027
02:23:03.56 --> 02:23:07.16
Good way to support yourself in your journey journey

2028
02:23:07.16 --> 02:23:13.80
Are we doing journey or you've been doing it to see you know, I know, but I just I have mixed still my own thought

2029
02:23:13.80 --> 02:23:17.34
It was still not comfortable. Yeah, I like when other people say it not myself anyway

2030
02:23:17.34 --> 02:23:21.82
In your getting after a journey waking up early sticking to the workout sticking to the diet

2031
02:23:21.82 --> 02:23:24.62
I think that's the that's the main one

2032
02:23:25.58 --> 02:23:31.26
You know same maybe but don't say maybe you're at my house the other day and you were part of what were you eating

2033
02:23:31.82 --> 02:23:35.28
Chunking wings no, it was it was all there's that apple pie

2034
02:23:35.28 --> 02:23:37.28
Wait wait wasn't I hope I know

2035
02:23:37.92 --> 02:23:42.96
There was something nonetheless this far as diets go I went I went not on the chicken wings

2036
02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:49.000
Technically the way those were made that wasn't much of a deviation from the diet

2037
02:23:50.20 --> 02:23:53.04
Anyway point there being diet is a hard thing

2038
02:23:54.20 --> 02:23:58.98
Yeah, exactly right and that's the point really even jockel gets not sometimes it was Saturday

2039
02:23:58.98 --> 02:24:05.10
So that could have been his cheat day who knows, but I'm just saying you can be on the program and the diet thing that'll sneak up on you

2040
02:24:05.10 --> 02:24:08.30
That'll sneak up on you when you're not ready like if you're if you have okay

2041
02:24:08.30 --> 02:24:12.86
I got to wake up at 430 you know when the insurgent is gonna come it's gonna come at 430

2042
02:24:13.86 --> 02:24:20.78
You got to work out at 830 or 5 or whatever time you know when the weakness might come so you can be ready for it

2043
02:24:20.78 --> 02:24:28.86
That diet thing you just don't know this is what I'm saying so nonetheless any moment of weakness this is what you do you?

2044
02:24:28.86 --> 02:24:32.38
Good eye toons or Amazon music and get an album

2045
02:24:33.18 --> 02:24:35.18
With tracks

2046
02:24:35.18 --> 02:24:39.18
Called psychological warfare all it is is a bunch of tracks

2047
02:24:40.14 --> 02:24:44.70
Jockel telling you why you should not skip workout you should not hit the snooze you should not

2048
02:24:45.58 --> 02:24:49.02
Eat the donuts no don't that practical

2049
02:24:49.02 --> 02:24:51.02
logical

2050
02:24:53.10 --> 02:24:58.30
Advice from jockel you know I could a lot of people they look for inspirational

2051
02:24:58.30 --> 02:25:01.66
Nice this is practical flimsy right inspirational

2052
02:25:01.66 --> 02:25:08.38
This very flimsy because it relies on you feeling like it this has not been with feeling this has to do by definition with

2053
02:25:08.38 --> 02:25:10.38
You not feeling like it

2054
02:25:10.38 --> 02:25:13.18
So let jockel talk you into

2055
02:25:13.18 --> 02:25:15.18
Making the right decision boom that's all it is

2056
02:25:15.18 --> 02:25:19.34
100% effective I dare you to skip the workout after

2057
02:25:20.78 --> 02:25:24.86
Work out and get off whatever the track is called the bunch of a month because you know

2058
02:25:25.58 --> 02:25:33.26
Again psychological warfare iTunes still number one by the way. That's a check holding holding strong holding strong for good reason by the way

2059
02:25:33.26 --> 02:25:37.74
Yeah, also when you're on Amazon you can get jockel white tea which I'm drinking right now

2060
02:25:37.74 --> 02:25:46.14
And the reason I'm drinking it is because it's delicious by the way. Well, it tastes like you victory. Wait the warrior kid

2061
02:25:46.70 --> 02:25:53.34
Book came out feedbacks been unbelievable getting photos of kids doing pull-ups studying

2062
02:25:53.50 --> 02:25:58.78
Doing juts who basically getting after it in all realms of getting after it which is which has been awesome

2063
02:25:59.18 --> 02:26:04.70
And if you want your kid to get after it yeah, or other kids around your kid to get after it

2064
02:26:04.70 --> 02:26:13.50
And become stronger smarter and better than get them way the warrior kid and I just got an email yesterday from a friend of the family

2065
02:26:14.06 --> 02:26:16.06
69 years old

2066
02:26:16.70 --> 02:26:18.70
Is that considered a kid?

2067
02:26:18.70 --> 02:26:19.34
a little bit

2068
02:26:19.34 --> 02:26:24.46
older than the kid. It's a little bit kid but guess what he said he learned a lot from Uncle Jake. I did I just finished it

2069
02:26:24.46 --> 02:26:30.06
Oh, you finished it a few days ago. I read one or two chapters just every night routine boom with my four year old

2070
02:26:30.62 --> 02:26:34.22
Just finished understanding she understands a percentage of it

2071
02:26:34.22 --> 02:26:38.06
She's for good things. She understands the impact. Yeah, so this is the plan

2072
02:26:38.06 --> 02:26:41.66
So she's gonna understand these really really basic things and

2073
02:26:42.22 --> 02:26:47.10
Maybe you know, I'm gonna just read it over and over and over so it comes to ethos kind of thing and then

2074
02:26:47.90 --> 02:26:50.54
After she gets older she's gonna start understanding the details

2075
02:26:50.54 --> 02:26:53.18
You know and then the more the older she gets more shenestead

2076
02:26:53.18 --> 02:26:55.54
She's gonna be her base way of thought or book the

2077
02:26:55.54 --> 02:26:57.54
All right the ethos boom

2078
02:26:57.82 --> 02:27:00.46

Not that much not crazy

2113
02:29:30.14 --> 02:29:35.50
100 bucks a month you train anytime you want any time any time you want well not 24 hours a day
