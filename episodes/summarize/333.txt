And, you know, I had one of our admirals one time tell me, you know, we were having a talk, I had a book coming out and, you know, he said something along the lines of, you know, I was like, well, you know, this is not really the quiet professional for me to be doing this. Like I, I'm hearing the things that I'm, I'm like mad if, you know, you know, like the floors cold when I get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I'm like, oh, this is weird. You know, he comes out and, and I'm like, wow, was it, you know, he's like, like, shaking his head like this. Like, they didn't seem like a human, like, all this guy, I didn't, I didn't picture a person with, like, hopes and dreams and that can't believe they just did that and they, they joined the Navy and now they're quitting, like, oh gosh, what? That's a good place to be going because, you know, I rack head settled down a lot at this point, you know, kind of after the the debt defender group going into Saudar City, you know, Iraq had definitely settled down. And so he was at boot camp, like going through some basic like wickets to get reinstated in the Navy and he had a try to, and you know, I was like, When he said that about when he woke up, and did, you know, like no passage of time, like that, so I got a concussion, like a bad one. Climate is rocks, you want to jump in the water, whatever, like, like, I was like, you said, oh, maybe, you mentioned real quick, I said, well, you know, and you know you've got limited opportunities in the rest of your career, it's going to be, I mean, I wouldn't want to type a person that's like, I'm always happy I wasn't going to war. So when I was out there just training, I was just doing the work, doing the work, doing the work and now all of a sudden it's like, oh, I have these opportunities to like monetize or what, you know, just I can actually create opportunities to give talks in this kind of thing and that came my way. We dialed in our training specifically over the, you know, postwork up phase where you can kind of, you know, we're going to deploy and we're doing a lot of operations in training that we're going to mimic, we're mimicking what we felt. But as I said, you're either in a platoon or your adult platoon, and I'm going to be out of a platoon, people say, yeah, but, you know, as an officer, you progress through, you're going to be, even if this didn't happen, you'd be, you know, you'd be administrative, you do be doing some staff tours, and I remember being in Canada, I remember going for a run, I remember going for a lift, I remember eating, I remember sitting in the briefing, I remember going to the plywood hut, I remember sleeping one night. You know, I think what I saw in Buds with my class was no matter how gifted a person was, there was probably going to be something at some point that was going to challenge them and one of the one of my classmates, this individual from the Naval Academy who I had known for four years at this point, was just a stud in Buds and there was one day at the very end for whatever reason the obstacle course rope with the low wall, the one he had, the high low. So man, I think to the contrary of what you're kind of saying about like, oh, trying to monetize this and the professional is like, hey, man, this is things are going to help people. It was a really steep learning curve, but it was also like a learning curve that was steep, but also had like really nice steps on it where you, you know, this training operation, you'd learn this thing and then they'd figure this other thing out and then they'd do this other thing. And I'm just, like, this, that's just not, you know, so, okay, you know, I'm going to do this job the way in which you'd been doing it, even if you can stay in the community. I, I didn't have to go through all that stuff in the Navy, I got to me like, yeah, maybe you're smarter and I was like, no, in my mind, I was like, no, I was dumb. But I always give that advice, you know, if you, there's no sense in acting like you know what you're doing, because everybody, not only do they see through it, but they don't expect you to know everything. and I think they eventually got to a point where like, hey, if a guy had just gone to Iraq or Afghanistan and maybe he'd gone twice in a row and now they put him in a puttune where he's not going to go and it was a little, it did get more fair as time went on. And so I wasn't even, I can't even name, I can only name one guy that quit and he was my boat crew leader and he was my boat crew leader in hell week, but that's the only, everyone else was just like, gone, I just never even thought about him, never even, and I never had thoughts, like, oh, I, you know, this guy's my friend. And then the other thing that figured out was like, anytime you'd hear someone panicking on the radio, screaming, you're like, I want to know what any people over here and whatever. But you know, when you think when I hear this, when I any time I hear an external account, such as what you're talking about Jason saying happened, it's just, It's just a reminder to me how lucky I mean to be alive and I'll take life like this missing two legs any day over dying up on that hill any day. You know, I remember thinking when I was in hell week, I was like, oh, it's going to feel so good to go to sleep. You know, of how hard seal training is because to me, I was like, there was just two groups of people, me and my buddies and everyone else, and we didn't know them and they just went away It's, it's pretty simple, but sometimes you know, in the chaos, you just, you just get overwhelmed and then, and then just to prioritize and execute, that's a really important rule that, you know, there could be, I can see situations in training environments or in combat where you're getting overwhelmed by either too much going on or you're actually overwhelmed because there's, there's actually no seemingly viable course of action. But like the amount, like waking up after being in a coma for 10 days and then having just the insane medical issues, just insane medical issues, no legs, freaking abdomen blown apart, close to me bag, the thing going down your throat, not even allowed to drink one sip of water. But you're putting yourself in a situation where external factors, you know, peer relationships, this kind of thing can actually, although it could be conceived and construed as adding pressure, I think it actually made, you know, at these kind of, you're at your breaking point moments. I feel like I, I feel like when I was in the medically induced coma that maybe people's conversations around we were sinking in but I didn't know for a fact and and to be then told in a state. and we were talking about and he just said like he was laughing, he's like you just looked at him and like all right, These like, pre- or post- deployment leave, excursions, but my point, I just like being outside, and I like being active. It grabs you by like, by like a gentle kind of like handhold I was like, I was saying this the other day, like they didn't seem like human to me. And then they're starting like words that they like make it a point to like, bleep out so their channel doesn't get cancelled. And I mean, when you're talking, and we probably could do a nine hour podcast if we went back and got medical records, when you're talking about all the things that you were going through from the time you woke up in the hospital, like I'm a baby. First time I fast-rope, like hey, this seems like it's going to be fun. You know, it's good road in like what do you call like a script, the real elegant script. I mean, you know, I'm, in addition to realizing all the medical complications that I have, you're thinking, what is my life going to look like? It's not people think wrestling and boxing, they think it's like a primal thing that you're just going to be able to do. This isn't like a guy that, like sometimes you get a lateral transfer that has like what they did. But the knockout, like, where my body was limp only lasted for like, it was like a flash knockout. Because you know, there's like two guys that were like faster than you. Like, or like, I'll get like a springed ankle and I'll have to wear an ankle brace. But I remember getting on that day pass, you know, I'm actually long headed bin from like, from you showed up there until now, you're getting your first day pass. Again, you know, from you, I get a cut in my mouth and I'm like, like, can't he catch up for a week? And I got very, very lucky to kind of stumble on these things in my career so that by the time I was, you know, you know, I was an opportune commander and a task into commander. So I always say we always kind of talk about how like people now or it's been said that people now they're complaining about like dumb stuff. So it was almost like this weird, like now when I hear some of the statistics and you know more about it And that's why you know, some of the initial reports that we got back on the strand was, you know, is he going to make it? So I kind of stumbled into these things and other things throughout my career that now when I either learn about the physiological, the physiological things that happen in our body that also people use things like meditation to drive these same physiological things, I kind of got lucky and stumbled upon them.
