but I think you you have an interview when you go in and they they sort of say You know you got all sorts in there you got guys who don't want to be in a military You know, I've got A what you got guys with drugs you got you know, you know, there's all things and when now You know you just don't it said you know I've gotten to fight and they're like you just got caught Mm-hmm. I hadn't really had That full transition so guys when they're getting out they have like two year build up You know to do all these workshops and these and this set up their companies my was almost You know crash bang your you're out the door my wife at this point was eight months pregnant You know some like I got it's any workout there, you know what I'm gonna do and we're out of sound like Liam Neeson People with our skill sets tends to be the private security industry You know some guys really thrive in the jungle and some guys It's almost like Closter phoat and you know you just spend a lot of time in there day in there and you hear the helicopter coming in and pick up the lads and you see guys It's just you guys randomly packing their bags in our cheetah now that what you're doing is it all well, you know I'm gonna fail this instructor said you know that ignored instructor said I was relentless but in pursuit of what and why Now Obviously you know it's uh something that You know we we have to deal with death on a big way and in Especially when with with people that You know I don't know how old your dad was when he died but 67 Had to had a grown son and and and kids and had lived his life and you know I know for me But you know we will have a website this password protected because for me the my approach to security is You know that there's certain ways of security up my as is more intelligent space You know you have the private element you know we then have the intelligence side of it and then and then the cyber You know we don't you know I don't normally walk around with type black t-shirts with tattoos you know what it's kind of like like You know when you go to work like let's say you go to work every day and you kind of let's say I don't know you're a manager I don't know whatever you go to work every day and you kind of get updated when you go in about and you they see that you made the effort and you've got the coveted green beret You know Probably they get less pressure if they've done the course But actually saying that the Navy guys were really good because a few years later Which were touch and I ended up being in instructor on the on this command of course So the Navy guys because they have no military background before this They've not picked up any bad habits and so what the instructors were telling them they were doing an Upstrate away where as you may have a Assage and or a staff sergeant who's you know been in 14 years and he's already picked up He's a little bad habits and it's happened to you know Realigning or reset that home all her cock But for us our course I didn't learn anything if I'm on I learned nothing on our course Every one of our instructors got sacked at the end of the course Our course was very officer heavy yeah well done, you know, he knows like you know and lads some Special forces don't even bother coming on selection it's like a big thing a female passing but to be honest, you know She deserved to pass and I I generally believe that if deserved pass you know you weren't the right and I did it much to the disgust of my friend The SES still like what you do it and because it's especially like wreckage it we had a hundred percent pass rate and it was like You know if this guy goes then you know people are gonna look at those options You know UK special forces 40 percent The UK special forces made up of the rule Marines. yeah 4,280 miles but you know unlike truckers and and support team you got a worry I've got crocodiles hippos civil war in South Sudan but one thing I'm excited about this challenge You know I talk about we talked about the successful private security missions You know everyone's quite quick to tarnish certain communities you know with one brush what they see with with TV And they read them and said yeah, these are good to go and you know I had a great senior officer Who said you know we're quiet professionals quiet professionals, but that doesn't mean we're silent professionals There's stories that need to be told there's lessons that need to be passed on so You know you look you can you never feel good about it because we're we're not We don't want the spotlight you're never gonna feel good about it It's always very you know I remember the conversations around when when I hadn't written a book and just saying like We're not gonna do anything that sheds any light that puts anything We don't have anything bad to say about the military about the seal teams like that's that's not what we're doing We're obviously not giving away any Information that could be useful at all to the enemy and You know, that's obviously of You know when when we ran these books when I ran these books through the chain of command But I hear that they'll be like hey like there's little writers there That'll be like hey look we're gonna send these people on a trip To the Bahamas and hey you like you got to you got to say that you don't want to go because of what this lady said Like last month on Instagram or something like this and you better tell her and we'll just see how it plays out kind of a thing So if you see something you like just let me know that you enjoyed my assistant directing I feel like we all kind of enjoyed your 10 List of 10 things that you utilize on the daily business What I think I think that was kind of a cool little hit that you guys kind of you know I mentioned that my daughter kind of drove the The spirit behind that and people think I think people think that that meant that she made it She kind of did You know they they had a means of income for me at the time It didn't work because I was smuggling people across borders You know I was a really you know close relationship with Harry you know so at the time it then didn't look right that you were on TV Say it wasn't you can't do it. You need to go there fully focused You know, so guys guys will get letters from their wives You know blue ease and she's having a bad day, you know if she's at home with a fridge or cold or blue We blew it you just be like blue blue blue envelopes which are free free post garot I was that awful as said I said that's fine But know that no other army light, especially airborne is gonna come in to esps if you call as marines You have to call as troopers so when I went there I was almost like the guinea pig You know what works what doesn't work and things like that You know If it wasn't for those local communities being so hospitable I would never been in success Well on them and that's where they African now is going to be great because it's I'm going to have to rely on the locals to help me and so You know it's not a real record whatever I do is the world record But one of the so that's the next challenge But one of the big feedbacks on the book is yes great endurance, but you are the security guru Why you still not in this industry so for me I've I've got a niche security company you know very low key We help either corporates. and You know, RF Leaming You know, you're tornados and you're your fighters you know with their brown shoes probably and the And let's see that Ariv Lee the J attack course is a wooden hut at the end of the runway You know, no one even knows were there And as we'll patrolling you know to the FRV I was a real man and I kept hearing Something I'm sorry to that Stop the team get down on one knee you know all round the fence and we're all looking for our size There's nothing there but you can hear Almost like the creep in in the leaves you know someone sneaking up on us Anyway, this carried on all the way through we got to the position even when we're in the OP position We could hear it but you need diversity You need diversity in there and that's what the army the army brought in Also the fact that at the time the SES We're running Iraq and the esps were running afghan so again, you know if you guys want to go on selection You know Iraq will start to wind down You know guys were looking towards afghan I thought I'll deal with that on the time It was there was the planet you know one of the things we'd got in the military is that meticulous planning and the detail You know even in the Canadian embassy I thought if you have the right plan Then you just bring that in it you know, so I just took a military set of orders and put it on it yeah, you know Sort of you know I when I got out as well I didn't want to be going out to Afghanistan and Iraq you know I've done my time in the dead I said look I'm gonna cycle the world longest road and you know doing a world record what what should we do it and The This was 2016 so his brother and Kay and him were about a launch campaign in 2017 called heads together Which was a mental health campaign and in the military I'd seen it firsthand, you know some my friends, you know For me yeah for weeks in the snow You know it separates the boys from the men What is the up tempo like when you'd get back out how often would how much downtime which is getting then you'd roll back out Now we'd be rolling you know we'd we'd obviously deserve some research It was it is everything from urban to rural you know we were doing stuff as well in in in vehicles We had snipers in in in the tall buildings in the middle of Pristina You know when you know we talk about identity crisis you spent All this time in the military working in a tiny net unit, you know Knowing what you're doing day out working alongside professionals to like Where do I now fit in society? I mean it's like the a different approach essentially then like a you know like when you think of prison Outside of the military you're like now that's your punishment straight up like you That's beyond a spinner for two hours each night for six weeks How was When you when you got dropped from selection the first time around like you kind of make it like it's no big deal I only know from my experience It's a when you if people don't make it through like a basic seal training It's it's it's horrible because you're gonna be in the regular navy and that's not what you're doing the navy to do and all of a sudden you're doing this other thing That's the only difference You know you are going to you're doing drill you know the guards we're like today We're gonna take off on the runway and there's just be much in this fast as you can I mean you have the gym instructors and then you do Aircraft recognition you'd be on the ranges you go from runs PT you would run out of the camp gates and I remember running like I think It's like you know because occasionally guys are getting the down check because whatever Yeah, I said you know did they may have got through the jungle phase, but it may be look Not this time but with the jungle you only get one attempt Is that that that's your only attempt So they they had their own life so when I joined the army that was it that was my family you know I would only get in touch my dad was at old school you know me and he I remember getting a phone call is that you got to ring your dad about really you know so it's a strategic move Obviously to do that and take care of those people and and give them a good deal and and clean your reputation up after it Been a little bit you know tarnished by this involvement and and you know you go into some details on the book on that about just just the fact that You know you can be sitting there talking to the actual prime minister of the country at the time But in all the planning in the place Doing all our wreckies using his private jet in butterfly over the areas identifying you know There's any aircraft we can utilize you know without the top of the the equipment list We had kit coming in from like platter tank you know all over the world Yeah, you know when guys were getting in trouble more because there's also less going on and Really a lot of a bull is down to leadership too, you know if you're if your Leadership isn't given you stuff to do and pointing you in the right direction Where do you end up if you're 18 years old if you're 21 years old if you're 19 years old and you don't you're not given good direction Where do you end up as a as a young male where do you end up echo Charles? and he said you know these guys Well, you know these guys will or make your man you know
