That's a good idea that makes sense You know, I like that those are all things that are gonna disarm somebody a little bit and Once you disarm them they're gonna they're gonna Open up they're gonna open up a little bit missile Launcher and it it has a radio or radar on it and it can track aircraft coming in and if you're a fighter aircraft You don't want to say what you want to stay away from that thing because it'll get you locked on radar It's gonna fire a heat-seeking missile at you and kill you So for them it's a surface it's a strong point for an aircraft it's a strong point But for a ground troop They don't put you know the highest level of troops Guarding these things because they're in the rear a little bit they put like kind of you know some what they call him here They're manned by troops who are not combat oriented so that means it's a softer target Back to the book. But if you're moving fast you can deal with that exposure Critics of these faster moving forms of combat characterized by initiative at the low level fear that they will lead groups To groups of men moving willy nearly about the battlefield and that commanders will lose control So people say oh, you know if I give so much so much initiative at the low level I'm gonna lose control of it and people are gonna be running around like chickens with their heads cut off This need not be so if the concept of surfaces and gaps is employed properly it will not be so That is why we have control measures the boundary the limit of advance the phase line can still be used It must be remembered that these control measures should serve their function But not be rigid lines that cannot be changed or ignored when the situation changes They should be kept to a minimum and must always be flexible Therefore it takes courage and moral character to select a main effort That is why the weak Commander and the amateur so often failed to do this in fact the weak commander will actively avoid choosing a main effort His very convenient for the commander weak and character to avoid selecting the main effort because if the battle goes on Favorably he can blame someone else for the mistake The commander who has taken the stand and selected his own main effort cannot do this Therefore in a sense the main effort is a moral commitment Taking some ownership by selecting the main effort And you got to dig that The next concept in again, you know I'm I'm cruising through this book like I always do only reading I don't know probably A very small percentage of it 15 percent and There's a ton in here you know and the dangerous part about getting giving to like going to front of the direction How you put it is you don't prepare them like they wind up when they're on their own Like they're not prepared for like like the tough parts Yeah, I'm the leader of the follow-up kind of thing Keep the goal in mine you're gonna do basically with your ownership You're gonna do your part and then some if someone's not doing you know certain things or whatever You're gonna take the lead you're gonna do your job in it to achieve the goal therefore pulling everybody ahead Fluidity Remember we even hear it a lot about in the Vietnam war the the Vietcong were too rigid they would just try their plan Didn't have the fluidity the main effort should be directed against enemy weakness not enemy strength Here you see the interconnection between the concepts the connection between the concept of the main effort and the concept of surfaces and gaps All the concepts are worked together at the same time the main effort cannot be understood in isolation from surfaces and gaps because it is directed against enemy weakness And another another One of the four laws combat that we talk about in the book extreme ownership is simplicity Simple back to the book even the principle of simplicity can be recognized in the concept of the main effort Instead of trying to do 10 different things we are focusing on one There will be many other efforts going on at the same time, but all in some way Directed at making the main effort succeed So what do you gain from this main effort? Right, you know like let's say I'm a way better striker than one guy and his duty to his way better than mine I can stay on you know it's obvious that's where I'm gonna talk but in this case, it's not like that. In order to this gives the order the quality that Eric von Mannstein called long term it can endure the test of time your commander can lose Communication with you yet you can still carry out his intent because you know what he wanted and you can Continue to act within his intent for a long time without checking back Understand why as briefed by Lieutenant Colonel echo Charles Fixed rules are not appropriate in instructing how to as how to assign missions to often students reject good ideas about tactics Because they cannot get their thoughts to fit the format of the operation order that is Being demanded the important thing is that the mission be clear Compared to clarity format is of little or no consequence Then this is We talk about it in extreme ownership that these massive power point briefs that I mean hundreds literally you know hundred to 150 slides to try and make the To try and brief a mission when and and the leaders would away so much time trying to put these briefs together Maybe there wasn't rebel, but we were we were like outsiders, you know, we were like going hard and The group of guys I was with when the guys I went through seal training with and went to seal team one with me back in the day You know, we we were getting effort we were pushing hard we were You know being hardcore yeah, like these kids who only get scolded, you know They don't get like compassion and and compliment and support you know they only get scolded a lot of times I mean there's a lot more to it, but a lot of times they're just gonna do the minimum and clearly to not get scolded too far together direction We get spoiled I would just call them free-frow information We're gonna learn from in the first the first section is called surfaces and gaps The concept of surfaces and gaps is one of several concepts that bear on tactics It is unimportant whether you refer to this concept as surfaces and gaps or soft spot tactics or simply the idea of Pitting your strength against the enemies weaknesses That is what it is all about strength against weakness call it what you will the term Surfaces and gaps is derived from a German term flaking on the lukin tactic Which means simply the tactics of surfaces and gaps the surfaces being the enemy strong points Which we avoid the gaps being the weak points that we want to go through Now La Delle Hart if we talked about already today Called it the expanding torrent system tactic he drew an analogy between attacking an attacking army and a torrent of water If we watch a torrent bearing down on each successive bank of earth and damn in its path We see that it first beats against the obstacle feeling and testing it on all points Eventually it falls it finds a small crack Through this crack pour the first driplets of water and rush straight on the pent-up water on each side is drawn towards the breach It swirls through around the flanks of the breach wearing away the earth on each side and so widening the gap Simultaneously the water behind poor straight through that breach between this the side eti's which are wearing away the flanks Directly it is passed through it expands to widen once more The on-reach of the turn of the torrent Thus as the water pours through it in and an ever increasing volume the on-reach of the torrent swells to its original proportion Leaving in turn each crumbling obstacle behind it Long paragraph yeah sure YouTube you can support that way and of course if you like the shirts Get a shirt Got a kind of a new one the the trooper one just it's just the basic brand in chocolate podcast if you're on YouTube right now I'm wearing one right now You know Debbie's one of the one of the troopers Just take a picture of the day like my mom just amazing background Mountains snow cap mountains trees Trooper trooper dish That was good. So right off the bat you'll be kind of one of those guys that's more approachable But here's here's one that's harder I mean it's simple, but it's it's kind of harder to do because I think it comes kind of natural Easy so not easy is don't talk bad about people and When people are talking bad about people like to you or around you or whatever don't like jump in and kind of accommodate them So then they talk about the ways you can do it you can do it through fire power of a drop in bombs by suppression by assault All those different ways to create gaps with you know using direct fire to soften up targets And then then I like these tactics a little bit better another way of creating gaps is through supporting attacks by attacking one point along the line We may divert the enemy from another point and by drawing them off created gap again this is in linear terms for instructional purposes for simplicity But do not get a linear mindset Sometimes a less costly way of creating a gap is through deception by causing the enemy to think that we will attack at one point There by enticing him to draw his forces off from another point
