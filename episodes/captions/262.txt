[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 262.
[00:00:03] With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:06] Good evening echo.
[00:00:07] Good evening.
[00:00:10] The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to Colonel
[00:00:17] Merit A. Edson, United States Marine Corps for service as set forth in the following
[00:00:23] excitation for extraordinary heroism and conspicuous interpetity above and beyond the call of
[00:00:32] duty as commanding officer of the first Marine radar battalion with parachute battalion
[00:00:37] attached during action against enemy Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands on the night
[00:00:44] of 1314 September 1942.
[00:00:50] After the airfield on Guadalcanal had been seized from the enemy on August 8th, Colonel
[00:00:56] Edson with a force of 800 men was assigned to the occupation and defense of a ridge dominating
[00:01:04] the jungle on either side of the airport.
[00:01:07] Facing a formidable Japanese attack which augmented by infiltration had crashed through
[00:01:14] our front lines, he by skillful handling of his troops successfully withdrew his forward
[00:01:20] units to a reserve line with minimum casualties.
[00:01:25] When the enemy in a subsequent series of violent assaults engaged our force in desperate
[00:01:32] hand-to-hand combat with bayonets, rifles, pistols, grenades and knives, Colonel Edson, although
[00:01:40] continuously exposed a hostile fire throughout the night, personally directed defense of the
[00:01:46] reserve position against a fanatical foe of greatly superior numbers.
[00:01:52] By his astute leadership and gallant devotion to duty he enabled his men despite severe losses
[00:02:00] to cling tenetiously to their position on the vital ridge thereby retaining command not only
[00:02:08] of the Guadalcanal airfield but also of the first divisions entire offensive installations
[00:02:16] in the surrounding area.
[00:02:20] Signed Franklin D. Roosevelt.
[00:02:27] That is an example of the level of heroism that was required to achieve victory in the battle
[00:02:36] of Guadalcanal which lasted from August 7, 1942 until February 9, 1943, six months and two days
[00:02:49] of just absolutely brutal and savage fighting.
[00:02:55] Then we've covered some of that in several books on the podcast
[00:02:59] and we even had Dean Ladd on the podcast who received a battlefield commission on Guadalcanal
[00:03:09] and went on to fight at Tarua and Sipan and Tinian but I recently received a copy of a book
[00:03:19] from a podcast listener by the name of David. I guess I'm a little cautious about giving out full
[00:03:24] names because I don't know the background so a guy named David, he sent me a book was actually
[00:03:32] not a book technically. It's a Fleet Marine Force reference publication FMFRP 12
[00:03:42] 110. The title is Fighting on Guadalcanal so thank you David for sending that to me.
[00:03:48] And the book is filled with all kinds of layers. One of them being the metal of honor citation
[00:03:55] that I started with, there's an additional layer in this which is that this
[00:04:02] Fleet Marine Force reference publication was put together by a guy named Colonel Red Reader
[00:04:09] who was West Point Class of 1926 who led the 12th Infantry Regiment
[00:04:15] who in the D-Day and he eventually was wounded and he received the Distinguished Service
[00:04:22] Gross and Silver Star in the Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star in the Purple Heart and he
[00:04:25] retired in 1946 and then he worked as the athletic director back at West Point and eventually
[00:04:31] became an author and he wrote a bunch of books including a memoir which is called Born At Reveley.
[00:04:37] So I'm sure at some point we will cover that book on this podcast but for tonight I wanted to
[00:04:47] I wanted to go to this book which is what I'm guessing is sort of the beginning of Colonel
[00:04:52] Reader's writing career was to put together this this manual fighting on Guadalcanal
[00:04:59] and it's the direct lessons learned and let's get right into it. So here's the forward.
[00:05:11] To secure the point of view of the fighting man in the Salmanol Islands,
[00:05:15] Lieutenant Colonel Russell P. Reader Jr., who I just mentioned, of the operations division
[00:05:21] of the award department general staff was designated as my personal representative.
[00:05:26] He reported to Major General Vandagriff, United States Marine Corps and Major General Patch
[00:05:31] U.S. Army on Guadalcanal and discussed with many officers and soldiers their experiences in
[00:05:38] jungle fighting against the Japanese. The stories of these men as told the Colonel Reader have been
[00:05:42] printed for your information. The American Marines and Do Bois show us that the
[00:05:48] job is no Superman. He is a tricky, vicious and fanatical fighter but they are beating him day after day.
[00:05:58] There's is a priceless record of the gallantry and resourcefulness of the American fighting man at his
[00:06:05] best. Soldiers and officers alike should read these notes and seek to apply their lessons.
[00:06:11] We must cash in on the experience which these and other brave men have paid for in blood.
[00:06:22] So that's what this book is. There's an opening note from Major General Vandagriff,
[00:06:30] just a very famous commanding general, the first Marine division. He says,
[00:06:36] I desire to thank General Marshall for the message which he has just sent me. I passed this
[00:06:41] message of congratulations onto my men. My message to the troops of General Marshall's in training
[00:06:47] for this type of warfare is to go back to the tactics of the French and Indian days.
[00:06:54] This is not meant for she'slessly. Study their tactics and fit in our modern weapons and you
[00:07:02] have a solution. I refer to the tactics and leadership of the days of Rogers Rangers.
[00:07:10] So there you go. Already we're talking about we got to make some things a little bit different.
[00:07:14] We got to look at the way we used to fight. If you think about that attitude of fighting
[00:07:20] with the Rangers, with Rogers Rangers, with the French and Indian War, this is the big difference between
[00:07:28] the way the British wanted to fight which was we're all lined up. We're standing in
[00:07:31] ranks and we're going to shoot and then you shoot and then we shoot back at you. We're not doing that.
[00:07:36] No, that's how we won the Revolutionary War because we're going to fight a different way.
[00:07:41] The early form of maneuver warfare. So that's what this book is. This is a bunch of just short
[00:07:48] anecdotal quotes from a bunch of Marines mainly about what their experiences are on Guadalcanal,
[00:07:56] bunch of great information. Gunnery, Sergeant H. L. Beard's Lee.
[00:08:04] Company G5th Marines. I've been in the Marine 16 years and I've been in three expeditions to
[00:08:10] China and five engagements since I've been in the Solomon's. I will say that this 1942 model
[00:08:16] recruit we are getting can drink more water than six old timers. We have to stress water discipline
[00:08:24] all the time. They don't seem to realize what real water discipline is. We have too many
[00:08:29] NCOs in the Marines who are Nambe, Pambi and beat around the bush. Our NCOs are gradually
[00:08:34] toughening up and are seeing reasons why they must meet their responsibilities. Respectfully speaking,
[00:08:41] sir, I think that when officers make an NCO, they should go over in their minds what kind of NCO
[00:08:49] will he make in the field? Water discipline. There's something you don't hear very often. You
[00:08:57] got to go deeper into the field before you start talking about water discipline because guess what?
[00:09:01] And I don't know when that, when did the word hydrate? Do you remember pre the word hydrate?
[00:09:06] Yes, right. Hydrate was a new thing. It's a relatively new thing.
[00:09:11] Yeah, that's for the expression hydrate. I think even the idea. Because when I was a kid,
[00:09:16] we didn't, we didn't have the word hydrate because hydrate seems like a proactive thing.
[00:09:22] Yeah, like like like you're going to get ahead of the curve. Right? You're going to,
[00:09:26] you need to hydrate. You need to stay hydrated. Hydrate or die?
[00:09:30] Sir, I never heard that. Hydrate or die? That was like that was the camel back. Remember
[00:09:34] camel back? That was their expression. Hydrate or die? Like the camel backs, the things with
[00:09:38] a little hose coming over. Oh, that was the camel back the brand. The camel back the brand. Have
[00:09:42] the expression hydrate or die? That's cool. So, but let's face it. What we're saying here,
[00:09:49] and you never hear this, he said, don't hydrate. If you hydrate too much, you're going to
[00:09:54] actually going to run out of water. You need to get water discipline. That's a totally different
[00:09:59] mindset. Now, I will tell you when you're going out on a long, like a desert patrol,
[00:10:04] where you're not going to get a water resupply, you've got to have some water discipline. Let me
[00:10:10] explain to you. You know, these guys fought when they needed to have water discipline big time,
[00:10:14] but it's interesting to hear that attitude. You don't hear that anymore. Everyone's all about
[00:10:21] hydrate. Hydrate. It's a different mindset. I'm sure maybe, so maybe there's some doctors that
[00:10:27] will approach us and kind of give us the real deal on that. Yeah, well, it makes sense because
[00:10:32] you have two different scenarios. Like, yeah, if you have the luxury to be able to just hydrate
[00:10:36] at will, then oh, yeah, hydrate, or die for sure. But, you know, water discipline, that I did kind of
[00:10:41] seems like it would be under maybe two specific circumstances where you don't have a lot of water
[00:10:48] just to go. Have you ever not had water? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like, where you were almost going to go down.
[00:10:57] Don't trade up dehydrated. What happened? Well, it was heat exhaustion. Okay. So the thing is I had
[00:11:03] water, but I didn't get enough water. Okay. What was the scenario? Football.
[00:11:09] But, so there was like a gatorade thing on the surface. So yeah, automatic. Yeah.
[00:11:14] Yes, sir. I was not out of water. Okay. My body was up like low on water. Can you get,
[00:11:21] can you get heat, whatever, heat, yeah, you can't. You can get a heat catch, we want your drinking water.
[00:11:25] Yes, sir. So, so you were saying you were kind of close to that. I guess that's different from just
[00:11:30] straight up dehydration. Well, dehydration is like levels, right? Like you're, they say you're 2%.
[00:11:36] dehydrated if you're even thirsty for water. That's what they say. But, so yeah, you know, it depends
[00:11:42] on what you're trying to say. You know, we're going to get a seat back on this one. I can tell you.
[00:11:46] Yeah. Makes sense. But, you know, in the field, you're talking about a situation where there's
[00:11:51] two elements where limited water, you don't have unlimited water because you can't carry unlimited
[00:11:55] water. And then you still have to function in the event of unlimited water or not on it. And let's
[00:12:01] face it. So, there's been, there's been a lot of times where I was thirsty, right, in the field.
[00:12:08] There's one time where I was in like a little bit of a bad situation where I could start feeling
[00:12:15] like, oh, this could be a problem. And we were out, we were out in the Ozarks in Arkansas doing this
[00:12:23] big land warfare problem. And we were expecting, you know, we had planned that, you know, there
[00:12:30] were streams. You could see on the map. And there was a couple. So, we, you know, okay, we'll be able
[00:12:34] to go this far and we'll be able to get water from the streams and purify it and then we'll go
[00:12:39] another distance and we'll get some more. Well, the first, like two or three streams that we
[00:12:45] came across were empty. They would dry it up. And so I was running danger close on water. And I'll
[00:12:52] tell you, not having water to me is the second, the second worst feeling in the world, the worst feeling
[00:12:59] the world is don't, don't have air. But the thing is, we don't have air. That's only a bad feeling
[00:13:04] for like 30 seconds. And then your past time. Yeah, you're done. Not have water. It takes a while.
[00:13:12] So, and when you try, when you go too deep in the red zone there, it's not like you can just
[00:13:17] drink water and get out. Like air. A lot of times like when you're like, let's say you're in the
[00:13:20] red zone air. But you can still recover. You just take a huge breath on the road to the cover. But
[00:13:26] water, you get like a forreal heat exhaustion or a heat stroke is death, but like exhaustion, like a
[00:13:33] forreal one. And you drink water, you'll just throw it up because your body can't really take
[00:13:37] in that kind of water yet. You have to do the IV thing, you have to do this big process, you know?
[00:13:42] So, oh yeah, no water is shit. So, I'm sure someone will contact us and tell us like,
[00:13:47] what the, there's got to be some minimum protocol. Because that's the thing that I have, you know,
[00:13:52] you got to have some kind of minimum protocol. Like what's the minimum amount of water you need?
[00:13:56] I hate being thirsty. I would carry a lot of water. Yeah, I would carry a lot of water. But you know,
[00:14:01] you know, you just made me think of, you know, when you're caught in a triangle or something or
[00:14:05] you're caught in a guillotine and you get out and like how good you're going to stay.
[00:14:09] Oh, I feel so good. I feel so good. I guess it's really triangle.
[00:14:14] So, triangles are hard to breathe, but like a guillotine and a guill choke, you're like having a
[00:14:21] hard time breathing. Yeah, because like a good, re-er naked, you know, you're not, it's a different,
[00:14:27] you don't, you don't feel all panicky. Right? Because you're still taking breaths. Yeah. You're
[00:14:30] like, oh good, I'm good, good night. You're right about the guillotine there because I think there's
[00:14:36] two elements in the guillotine defense that makes you not breathe. So like one, it's pressing
[00:14:41] against your windpipes. So you can't hardly breathe. But another one, you're trying to tense your
[00:14:44] net to resist like that, that torque. So when you tense your neck, it's like harder to actually
[00:14:50] take a, take a deep breath, you know, it's like those double things. I've been training with Dean,
[00:14:56] Dean, Listsch, Dean Lister for a long time, 25 years. He showed me some guillotine defense the other
[00:15:03] day and I was like, you waited 25 years to show me this guillotine defense, I couldn't guillet
[00:15:09] him and then he couldn't guillet me show this defense. I'm like, what, what, what, why wouldn't you show
[00:15:13] me that? Why would you not show me that? Yeah, bro. That's probably like he has so many,
[00:15:17] you know what? He has so many things, but he also, he just thinks that everybody knows everything.
[00:15:23] Right. You know, so if you don't ask him about it and the only reason he was showing someone
[00:15:27] else and I'm like, what's that defense? He goes, oh, you just do this here and put this hand here
[00:15:31] and I was like, you never show me that. Yeah, he was, oh, oh yeah, that's real obvious.
[00:15:36] I feel like an idiot. All right. So there you go. Water discipline.
[00:15:43] Next, I have just been promoted from first sergeant. This is sergeant major B, Medsger fifth
[00:15:51] Marines. I have just been promoted from first sergeant. In the firefighting, the Marine first sergeant
[00:15:56] helps the company commander. He checks up on the company as a whole, even down to checking on
[00:16:03] the evacuation of the wounded. I was able. I was available to the company commander for any emergency
[00:16:09] orders during the firefight. Teacher soldiers serve that when a man is hit in the assault to
[00:16:15] leave him there. Too many of our men suddenly become first aid men. Your men will have to be rugged
[00:16:22] and rough and to win. They must learn to disregard politeness and must kill.
[00:16:28] So a couple things there. First of all, I'm going deep on this. So first of all, this is what
[00:16:37] I used to, when I used to teach, when I used to teach the young seals about leadership,
[00:16:40] I would teach roles in responsibility for every individual person inside of a politoon
[00:16:45] from a leadership perspective, fire team leader, squad leader, put tune leader,
[00:16:50] task leader leader, a company commander level. And the senior and listed guy,
[00:16:55] which is what he's the company first sergeant. And what you want to do and the way I used to explain
[00:17:03] it to guys in the exact same thing and he's saying you want to be the action arm for the leader
[00:17:08] for the commander. So basically you're the guy with all this experience.
[00:17:14] But if something's going wrong, like you got a problem, you got to be the guy that the company
[00:17:19] commander can look at and go says, go solve that problem and you have the capacity to do it,
[00:17:24] because you're not assigned any specific role. So you should actually do your best to keep your
[00:17:31] company first sergeant like free from direct responsibility so that he can be your action arm
[00:17:39] to go make things happen. That's number one, number two is prioritizing execute.
[00:17:46] Everyone wants to help out the wounded guy. You can't. You got to win first. You can't, you can't
[00:17:51] do that. And then let's face it. This is total war. And these guys are just in a different level.
[00:18:01] You got to disregard politeness and you got to just kill people. That's where we're at.
[00:18:07] That's what's so interesting about about with the old breed by Eugene Sledge.
[00:18:13] And in the HPO series, the Pacific, they portray Eugene Sledge. He's kind of like this
[00:18:19] very nice, very polite guy. That's how they portray him. And then you see videos of the real
[00:18:26] guy, the real Eugene Sledge. That's exactly what he's like. He's kind of like a southern gentleman,
[00:18:31] young, very nice, very kind. And those guys were getting thrown into this savvetry.
[00:18:41] And that's what this, that's what this, that's who this message is for. You got to disregard
[00:18:45] politeness and kill. Now Eugene Sledge, we should probably, we should probably do that book again,
[00:18:50] but Eugene Sledge, you know, he had to, he had to put some things in check himself. And he watched
[00:18:55] guys rip in Japanese soldiers teeth out that were gold and like, you know, pissing on the, and
[00:19:02] then he saw crazy stuff. And he had like a line that he didn't cross over. But he also understood it.
[00:19:08] So even a guy that says nice and, and a good of a person, which Eugene Sledge apparently was,
[00:19:17] even he realized like, this is, this is next level. There's another situation. This is normal.
[00:19:24] Patoon Sergeant HR strong company A fifth Marines. Some of my men thought their hand grenades
[00:19:30] were too heavy. They tossed them aside when no one was looking later. They would have given six
[00:19:36] months pay for one hand grenade. There you go. Short turn versus long turn.
[00:19:44] Got to carry that little extra weight of the hand grenade.
[00:19:49] Patoon Sergeant FTO Fera company B fifth Marines after the japs had been located. My
[00:19:54] Patoon has gained the element of surprise by moving in fast with bayonets and hand grenades.
[00:19:59] In turn, they have surprised us by being in a defensive position on the reverse slope of a
[00:20:05] ridge. I think the snipers look for bar bayarmen. And then Colonel Edson said no doubt about this
[00:20:13] and want to gauge men in one platoon every bayar gunner was hit. So this idea that you could locate
[00:20:23] them, this is sort of like in jiu jitsu when you get, let's say you get the mount position you
[00:20:27] immediately go for the arm lock. Sometimes that's what enough to do it, right? Whereas if you get
[00:20:32] mount and you're like, okay, I got the mount, that person's going into defensive position and now they're
[00:20:35] going to set up for it. And so what he's saying is if they locate the Japanese, immediately they go
[00:20:42] out and with grenades and bayonets, which the good thing about grenades and bayonets is now you're,
[00:20:46] they can't really locate you because of your, because of your muzzle flashes and where you're
[00:20:51] shooting, you're just getting in there with grenades and bayonets, which is, you know,
[00:20:57] you think about modern warfare, you don't think of the tactic of, hey, when we make contact,
[00:21:07] we're going to immediately attack with bayonets and grenades. That's what kind of war this was.
[00:21:16] Patoon Sergeant R.A. Zolo, company C5th Marines. Sir, I would like to tell you that
[00:21:21] that a man's keenness or doneness of I made determine whether or not he will live. 10 men in
[00:21:28] my platoon were killed because they walked up on a jab 37 millimeter gun. I went up later after the
[00:21:33] gun had been put out by our mortars to help bring back the dead. The Japanese gun was so well
[00:21:38] camouflaged that I got within four feet of the gun before I saw it.
[00:21:42] Corporal WA McClusky, company D5th Marines. Sir, the other day on bloody ridge riflemen
[00:21:54] protecting our light machine guns pulled out and left us. We were doing okay at the time,
[00:21:59] but they're pulling out caused our whole outfit to withdraw. I think the men in these rifle
[00:22:06] companies should receive some training in the work and in the mission of the machine gun
[00:22:10] company they should be able to act more intelligently. What does that mean? You should have your
[00:22:15] team cross train no matter what business you're in. No matter what kind of team you have. You should
[00:22:21] cross train and the interesting thing about that and we've read that we've read about this before.
[00:22:28] When people see other people running away, you've got a pretty good chance that those people
[00:22:32] are going to run away too. This is just mob mentality. Second lieutenant Andrew Tysik,
[00:22:41] fifth Marines. I think that in the regimental supply there should be extra canteen so when the
[00:22:47] out when an outfit gets in a place like the table plateau where there is no water and extra
[00:22:52] canteen of water can be issued. Sir, this would really help our men stay in there.
[00:22:57] What's interesting, this is all done like an interview. That's why they keep saying things like
[00:23:03] sir, they're talking directly to this guy and he's just putting the clothes in there. They're talking
[00:23:07] to Colonel Reader. Marine Gunner, ES rust, fifth Marines. I hate to admit it, but it's the truth.
[00:23:14] When we got here, a lot of our young men were confused at night. They were not used to the
[00:23:18] jungle at night. They could not use their compasses at night and we did not have enough
[00:23:22] compasses. We have learned that when we get off the beaten trails it seems to confuse the japs
[00:23:27] and we have better success. So what does that mean? You've got to train at night. Platoon Sergeant J.
[00:23:32] CL Hollingsworth, company H. Fifth Marines. When we moved around on these jungle trails, we have
[00:23:38] learned to have men at the rear of each platoon who carry light loads so they can quickly,
[00:23:43] so they can get their weapons into action quickly to help overcome ambush fire from the rear.
[00:23:48] That's what you want to do as a human, as a human that's strategizing in the world,
[00:24:00] is you want to have an element that's flexible and can move quickly to help you overcome situations.
[00:24:08] So whether you're in business, whether you, whatever situation you're in,
[00:24:13] you want to have a specific element that is designed to move quickly and give support where it's
[00:24:24] needed. Could go left, could go right, could go north, could go south, could go east, could go west.
[00:24:29] Why do you need that? Because you can't predict the future. So you should design your plans
[00:24:36] so that the design of the plans is inherently flexible. Put the big rugged men into the heavy weapons
[00:24:47] company. Just throwing out their froll the young men going in the military. They're going to
[00:24:55] saddle you up with that big gun and you're going to carry it. Good. From some of our new men were so
[00:25:02] scared of our hand grenades when they first, when they were first issued that they jammed the down the
[00:25:06] codder pin later in action, they could not pull the pin. I noticed as I get and I pointed out,
[00:25:13] pointed this out to my platoon that when a man gets hit, the men close by get to yell in
[00:25:18] corn and corn and cornmen. They get so excited sometimes that they actually forget to use their own first
[00:25:23] aid packets. In first aid training, teach correct use of injecting morphine and procedure of tagging
[00:25:30] because what are you going to do when the cornmen gets hit? I give $75 for a pair of tennis shoes to
[00:25:38] rest my feet and for use in night work. Classic. I have only been in the Marine Corps for years,
[00:25:48] but I have learned that you have got to develop a sense of responsibility in the men wearing
[00:25:52] Chevron's. Right? You got to develop that responsibility. In action, we have had unauthorized
[00:26:00] persons yelling cease firing or commenced firing this caused confusion. Platoon Sergeant George E.
[00:26:10] A. Ho. Ah Ho. Company fifth. Company fifth. Company fifth. I put five years in the US Army
[00:26:16] before joining the Marine Corps. Sir, I like the Marines better than the Army because the
[00:26:20] average Marine officer is closer to his men than the average Army officer whom I observed.
[00:26:26] We have comradeship in the Marine Corps. Also, the Marine and listed men are more Spartan like.
[00:26:31] I believe, sir, we baby our soldiers too much in peace time. I hope we are not doing this now.
[00:26:38] And then here's a comment from Colonel Reader here. I asked Colonel Edson,
[00:26:45] and Edson is the guy that we read the Medal of Honor citation from. I asked Colonel Edson what
[00:26:51] kind of a sergeant, A. Ho. was. And he told me that he was one of the outstanding men in his
[00:26:57] regiment and that he was a very rugged individual. I heard that. I was like, I can picture this
[00:27:03] dude. You know, he gets described as you're in Guamalcanal with Marines. And you in that
[00:27:12] environment with the toughest bastors in the world, you get, you get described as a quote,
[00:27:17] very rugged individual. You know, George E. A. Ho. Platoon Sergeant company F. Fifth Rees
[00:27:24] doesn't play around. He continues on. In our training for this jungle warfare, we had a great
[00:27:29] deal of work and hand-to-hand individual combat use of knife, jujitsu, etc. Let's face it when I read
[00:27:38] that I got very, very, very, you know, we were feeling good about it. What's the year on that?
[00:27:44] In 1943? Yeah. That's the tradition. Jujitsu. It's not the prison. Jujitsu. Okay. Well, maybe it is
[00:27:51] actually because in 1925. That's what it is. Yeah. But this is prejuato. No, it's not prejuato.
[00:27:57] So it's jujitsu. Let's take it for one of its work. Anyways, your excitement is going to go
[00:28:01] down just like mine did because he says this. With the exception of bayonet fighting,
[00:28:05] we have not used this work. I've been in many battles since I hit the island and I've never seen
[00:28:10] anyone use it. Okay. So did some hand-to-hand training? Well, I think maybe just out of sort of
[00:28:18] GPL would have found a way to get my hand-to-hand. I could bring the jets. Every man should have a watch.
[00:28:27] That's a good one. Just to kind of let you know. I mean, think about you're going to
[00:28:35] warn you. No, I'm a watch. Our battalion commander made your wall once every last man in our
[00:28:42] battalion to know as much as he does about the situation. It pays. Think about that. You're in a
[00:28:51] leadership position. You should try and get every last man and your team to know as much as you do
[00:28:56] about the situation. It will pay off. He also says this. Get rid of gold bricks. It's better to be
[00:29:03] short-handed, having good men around than having a lot of underpendibles. You familiar with the
[00:29:11] term gold brick? No. Not in this context anyway. What context are you familiar with it in?
[00:29:17] A regular gold brick. Which is? That's a gold bar. Okay, got it, got it, got it. So that's the difference.
[00:29:23] A gold bar is made of gold. A gold brick is a brick painted like gold. Got. Have you ever seen the
[00:29:30] big Lebowski? Yeah, but like once. The term is heavily used in gold brick. So a gold brick is
[00:29:42] not it looks like good. You just hear for show. It looks good. No, no, no, no, no, no, go. All that
[00:29:47] exactly. Man, I got a book I just read for this podcast that will be coming in the future. But
[00:29:52] there's a guy that shows up in the Korean war and he's all square away and he's all he's all
[00:29:57] like right and tight. Everything's good to go and the older combat vets are like, I don't think so.
[00:30:03] And then one younger guy that's kind of that's a badass that's actually writing the book.
[00:30:07] He says, oh yeah, this guy's going to be good to go and sure enough. The older veterans,
[00:30:11] we're looking at him, he was suspect. He was suspect because he was like everything was kind of
[00:30:17] perfect. Kind of like that conversation we had the other day about music and everything being
[00:30:22] perfect and if it's too perfect, it's not real. Well, that's kind of the impression these guys got,
[00:30:26] oh, this guy is totally perfect. Well, guess what happened when the bullet started flying? He had a,
[00:30:32] he had a trick knee and all of a sudden he couldn't get after it. So to me, that right there,
[00:30:41] gold brick. Got you. Corporal JS Stankas company, E fifth Marines. On this is Harry firing,
[00:30:49] gives your position away and when you give your position away, here you have to pay for it.
[00:30:53] Man, I went on like the crazy, I've gone on crazy tendons about giving away your position.
[00:31:02] On that's very firing and I'm not talking about combat. I'm talking about
[00:31:05] in conversations, in leadership situations where you give away your position.
[00:31:12] You take shots at echo. Ecclesions, you know, I'd like to use this plan over here and I go,
[00:31:16] that plan doesn't make any sense. And now I'll say, you know what I stand.
[00:31:20] Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Why would you do that? Why would I say, well, explain to me more about your plan?
[00:31:27] And then ask you a question about it.
[00:31:30] Because if I, if I give my position away, all of a sudden you're, you're not even, you're already like defensive.
[00:31:35] I'm causing problems. Why do that? Hmm. And by the way, you might now attack me, because I just gave my
[00:31:39] position away. Now you might start throwing shots at me. So when you say, here's my plan, and I say,
[00:31:44] you're playing doesn't make any sense. I just gave my position away. I don't think your plan makes sense.
[00:31:47] There's my position. Whereas if you say, here's my plan, and I say, why do you want to put guys over here?
[00:31:52] Or why do you want to move this over here? And you start answering my questions. I haven't given my position away.
[00:31:56] You're not defensive. You're trying to explain it to me. Maybe your plan makes sense, but I just didn't
[00:32:00] understand it. Hmm. So don't give your position away. Notting Guadalcanal and not in the,
[00:32:06] meeting with your, with your team. Hmm.
[00:32:11] The men in my squad fire low at the base of trees. There's too much high firing going on. I have
[00:32:18] I have observed. Japs often get short of ammunition. They cut bamboo and crack it together to simulate
[00:32:28] rifle fire to draw our fire. They ain't Superman. They're just tricky bastards.
[00:32:32] Second Lieutenant HM Davis fifth Marines in parentheses promoted on the field of battle. Do you
[00:32:42] understand what that means? Uh, thanks. Okay. So you understand that there's enlisted guys in the
[00:32:48] military. And there's officers. Yeah. So basically the enlisted guys have not gone to college.
[00:32:52] The officers. Well, I guess the enlisted guys may have gone to college, especially nowadays. There's a lot of
[00:32:58] enlisted guys that are going to college. But the in these days, most likely the enlisted guy hadn't gone to college.
[00:33:03] So they went through a regular training pipeline and you're sort of the workforce of the military,
[00:33:07] then the officers, they've been to college and they've been through some kind of a training program
[00:33:12] to make put them into a leadership position. Is that kind of like at a company, the difference between a guy who
[00:33:17] has a great resume degree, blah, blah comes in at a certain high position versus the guy who worked his way
[00:33:23] up through like the mail rule. So a little bit, but let's say a construction site you've got a guy that
[00:33:30] went to college for civil engineering and he's he's overseeing the whole project, right? And he's
[00:33:35] he got his degree three years ago. But then you've got a guy that's been working construction
[00:33:40] since he was 14 years old and now he's been doing it for 28 years and he's the foreman or he's
[00:33:45] any of those people in between. Right. That's that's kind of the break out. So to get promoted on the
[00:33:52] field about a battlefield promotion to be commissioned is it's pretty powerful. That means that
[00:34:01] when all this mayhem was going on, they skipped you through like entire an entire spectrum of
[00:34:09] promotions to the next completely different level. It's hack worth actually in Korea. Got
[00:34:15] battlefield promoted. Like you're so good. We're going to take you and we're going to put you in charge.
[00:34:19] Yeah. So it'd be like if it'd be like if you showed up as the brick carrier and you did such a good
[00:34:27] job and then they said, well you can put start putting, but you did that and you did something else
[00:34:31] and then the next thing they promoted you to the guy that was the civil engineer. Put you in
[00:34:35] charge the whole project. So that's because when you hear about second lieutenant HM Davis,
[00:34:41] fifth Marines promoted on the field of battle. We're talking about full legit. He says travel light.
[00:34:49] For example, the hell with all the mess equipment. We used our mess cup and spoon for the first 15
[00:34:53] days here and enjoyed our chow. You don't have to live like a gentleman in jungle warfare. Our
[00:35:00] mess equipment is too bulky for this type of warfare makes noise. There you go. And then he says this,
[00:35:07] not every man can lead a battalion. Find out who can lead your battalions before you go into combat
[00:35:15] areas. And then Colonel Edson, in parentheses, remarked by Colonel Edson says, I would like to
[00:35:25] concur in that statement. So the metal of honor recipient, the commander of that battalion.
[00:35:30] He says, I like to concur with that. There's something that's so pure and just unmercifully
[00:35:39] beautiful about combat when it comes to like, hey, we can't we don't we can't afford to play around.
[00:35:45] It's kind of cool when I was in Sri Lanka, which we covered on like podcasts three or something
[00:35:51] working with those soldiers that were fighting against the to meal tigers. And if they had someone
[00:35:58] that was good, they'd be like you're promoted. You're going to be in charge. If they had someone
[00:36:02] that bad, you're you're not in charge anymore. They didn't care about anything. There was no HR department.
[00:36:07] There was no, hey, we're going to document what mistakes you made. We're going to count to you.
[00:36:11] They're like, no, you made like five bad calls and wrote, you're done. And you, young recruit that's
[00:36:16] been doing great. You're you're in the game. You will put you in charge. It was very cool. And that's
[00:36:22] what happens in war. It doesn't so much happen in peacetime. In an advanced and in an advanced
[00:36:28] in the jungle, it's hard for a platoon leader to keep control of his men. Corporals and their
[00:36:34] men must be taught to act individually. It's a little something that we like to call decentralized
[00:36:40] to command. You are not going to be with everyone. You can't control them. It doesn't work.
[00:36:46] Platoon sergeant, CM, Fagan, company on fifth Marines. I haven't been fired at many times
[00:36:58] by snipers and I haven't seen one yet. I threw that in there was a lot. I skipped over some
[00:37:02] of these, but there's a lot of people complaining about snipers. The sabers, which the Japanese
[00:37:10] officers carry have proved to be worthless. I killed two japs who came out me with sabers and I
[00:37:15] got them first by shooting them. You remember that scene in Indiana Jones? Yes, or you know,
[00:37:22] all scenes. Which one? Some guy comes out and he's swinging a sword around like kind of a
[00:37:29] real sealed. I got the sword and we're going to fight in Indiana Jones, shrugs and
[00:37:36] children just pulls a pistol out and shoots. That's what I mean. When I heard this all was like, well,
[00:37:40] yeah, if you've got a gun, these make it a statement. Hey, a gun is better than a saber.
[00:37:46] Well, thank you. We agree. But this is a new kind of obvious. That scene in Indiana Jones.
[00:37:53] Yeah. A US for it. So here you go. That scene in real life, they were going to have or the original
[00:37:59] script or whatever. They were going to have a this epic kind of battle sword battle. But in the
[00:38:04] end, or Tereson Ford had to use a bathroom, bro bad. So he pulled that out as a little improv. They just
[00:38:11] kept it. Cool. Good to know. Never mind the bottom. Water canal. Let's hear about the bathroom battles
[00:38:19] on the set of Indiana Jones. It's different. I haven't seen this. Then he says this, but I wish
[00:38:26] I had in reserve a good jungle knife. I don't mean I don't mean a bowloat, which we should
[00:38:33] have for cutting trails, but a knife with a 12 inch blade, a good steel. We could use this against
[00:38:40] these, these japs as well as cutting vines that catch us at night. And then says, no, many men
[00:38:45] expressed their wish for a jungle knife, such as described here. This desire is being omitted
[00:38:52] in further remarks to avoid repetition. So everybody who's like, give us a big ass knife.
[00:38:57] Corporal Fred Carter company, I fifth Marines. On the river, we got to firing at each other
[00:39:08] because of careless leadership by the junior officers. We had a little blue on blue situation.
[00:39:13] We are curing ourselves of fromissue as firing, but I should think new units would get training
[00:39:20] to make the men careful. There you go. This guy's had a little blue on blue situation. And he's
[00:39:26] saying, I should think new units would get training to make the men more careful. Yeah.
[00:39:33] That's what I did when I had a blue on blue friendly fire situation came back and said,
[00:39:38] I'm going to train people. So this doesn't happen to him. We learned not to fire unless we had
[00:39:44] something to shoot at, doing otherwise discloses your position in where you say ammunition.
[00:39:48] He says, I've been charged twice by the Japs in bayonet charge. Armourines can outbrain
[00:39:58] up fight them and I know our army men will do the same. And then note by Colonel Edison,
[00:40:04] incidentally, in the last push, we executed. We executed three bayonet charges.
[00:40:10] Sergeant O. J. Marion company L fifth Marines, a platoon guide. You crawl in the advance.
[00:40:24] Unless you are to charge and make it. The reason for this is that all men hit our hit from the
[00:40:34] knees up except for ricochets. We have crawled up to within 25 yards of a machine gun firing over
[00:40:40] our backs. The Japs don't depress their machine gun. Men get killed rushing to help a wounded man.
[00:40:48] If the wounded man would crawl about 10 yards to his flank, he can generally be aided in safety
[00:40:52] as the Japs seem to fire down lanes in the jungle. Colonel Edison said, we have taught our
[00:40:58] men that in the best way to aid a wounded man is to push ahead so that the wounded man can be cared
[00:41:02] for by the Corbin. The men have been the men have to be trained individually for when the fire
[00:41:11] starts, the corporal can't see all of his men and further when the order for attack is given,
[00:41:16] any number of men are unable to see the man on his right or left. So you see, sir, it takes guts
[00:41:21] for the men to get up and move forward when the signal is given. The men have to depend on one
[00:41:29] another and have confidence in each other. So again, if you've been trippled like this,
[00:41:35] you have a trippled canopy jungle, like real thick jungle. Yeah, obviously, it's really,
[00:41:41] you can take five steps and you can't see that another person. And that's what these guys are
[00:41:45] seeing for the first time. Well, not for the first time, but they're seeing, hey,
[00:41:50] somebody gets five feet away from me. I can't see anymore. They have to know how to act on
[00:41:54] their own. They have to be ready to utilize decentralized command. He says, I was in one advance
[00:42:01] when the Japs let us come through and then rose up out of covered foxholes and shot us in the back.
[00:42:08] The best cure for that is rear guard looking towards the rear. Corporal FR, Macauan,
[00:42:16] company L fifth Marines. Sometimes the information doesn't get down to us and then we are really in the
[00:42:22] dark. When we get the orders and information, we can get in there and pitch better. Again,
[00:42:29] make sure you keep your people informed. My普通 is the best one in the company because we are
[00:42:37] all like a baseball team. Our lieutenant is like the captain of the team. He is close with us and
[00:42:43] we like him and yet respect him. We have a wonderful普通. I'm not bragging. That's a fact.
[00:42:49] And then here's the note in parentheses. When I read this to Colonel Etz and at the end of the day,
[00:42:56] he was so delighted that he sent a runner to find out who corporal Macauan's platoon leader was.
[00:43:01] Give that guy a promotion. And here's the interview with Colonel Merit Etz and himself. And again,
[00:43:11] this is the guy who received the Medal of Honor that I read at the beginning of this podcast.
[00:43:20] He says, if I had to train my regiment over again, I would stress small group training and the
[00:43:26] training of the individual even more than we did when we were in training. So there you go. Everyone is
[00:43:32] stressing that people need to be able to think for themselves and make things happen.
[00:43:36] And there must be training and difficult observation, which is needed for the offense.
[00:43:44] It is my observation that only 5% of the men can really see while observing.
[00:43:55] Yeah. What's crazy about that is they do drills, especially human sniper school, where they put
[00:44:03] like stuff out in the field, like a canteen and a knife and a notebook. They put all the stuff in the field.
[00:44:10] And then they bring you out to the field and you get to sit and position you got to look and
[00:44:17] you got to see. You got to have a kind of hidden partially hidden. So they'll put 10 items out there.
[00:44:23] And you got to sit there with your notebook and you got to write down all the items that you can
[00:44:26] see in what their location is. And somebody that's really and there's different people have
[00:44:31] different levels of skill at actually observing things. So some people get, oh they get 9,
[00:44:37] they get 8, they get 10. Some people see like three or four things. So to actually train for that
[00:44:43] is important. The other crazy thing about this is I'll talk about this on a EF online the other day.
[00:44:53] It's hard. It's hard to see and sometimes things that you think are so obvious
[00:44:59] other people aren't seeing. And sometimes if you think what you're doing, no one can see,
[00:45:08] they can all see it. So if you think you're making some little tactical move that no one's saying
[00:45:12] you're wrong. If you're making some little maneuver to get that position or whatever and you think
[00:45:19] that it's all good, no one can see it. You're wrong. Everybody can see it. Everybody can see it.
[00:45:25] You know who can't see it? You can't see that they can see. The offensive is the most difficult
[00:45:36] to support as you cannot tell exactly where your troops are. So scary. Whether the
[00:45:42] Japs will continue to fight as they do now, I don't know that defend on the low ground and
[00:45:46] the jungle, they dig standing trenches extremely well camouflaged. And then he goes into some
[00:45:51] really tactical level stuff talking about the need for a rifle grenade, the need for knee
[00:45:58] mortar. Why that would be good because it gives the platoon commander kind of at-hand weapons.
[00:46:06] He says this, I suggest that you have maneuvers with ball ammunition, which is basically
[00:46:13] doom and novers with real bullets. And then he says, even if you get a few casualties,
[00:46:19] he says, I was like dang. And now in the seal teams, we do live fire training all the time.
[00:46:27] And not only that, we do incredibly complex maneuvers with live fire. And it's so beneficial
[00:46:39] that you're just used to it. You know, you're used to it. You really learn about
[00:46:43] paying attention and safety and how to keep your distance and all those really important things.
[00:46:53] But if you, the other thing, I will say we got, when I first came in the teams,
[00:46:57] that's all we did was live fire. And it was sort of like a vuffing.
[00:47:02] You know, it's sort of like, that's as good as it gets like it would do live fire.
[00:47:06] It was one of those things. And it was, you know, you go, well, it's live fire. And you do
[00:47:10] so much of it that it became. So it wasn't really, it's just normal, right? Live fire was just totally
[00:47:16] normal. I'll tell you, operate. But once we got some munition and like the high speed laser
[00:47:22] tag systems, that's when you got, you have to do both. But that's when you got good at actually
[00:47:29] combat because when you're going live fire, you're not going against anyone, but paper targets.
[00:47:33] I'm saying don't move. But you have to do it. Yeah. So he goes into more details about the kind of boots
[00:47:43] that they have. And he says the same thing that everyone's been saying in your training, put your
[00:47:48] time and emphasis on the squad and platoon rather than on the company, but time and regimen.
[00:47:53] So train at the lowest levels. Your principle of the command post up into the front is certainly true here
[00:48:00] in your scouting and patrolling and your training in patience, which you should have, have the men
[00:48:09] work against each other. So he's saying the same thing, you have to do something where you're actually
[00:48:14] going against other humans, not just against paper targets. Same thing for squad and pltunes in
[00:48:19] their problems. Develop better snipers, it goes on to a bunch of things. Smoking lamp, once a smoking
[00:48:24] lamp goes out and it gets dark, you have to be quiet. Yeah. He goes into this example. In the
[00:48:34] Raiders, we adopted the custom of dropping all rank and titles. We used nicknames for officers,
[00:48:39] all ranks used these nicknames for us. We did this because the nips caught onto the names of the
[00:48:45] officers and would yell or speak at night. This is Captain Joe Smith talking, a company with
[00:48:50] draw to the next hill. So we adopted nicknames with code words. Captain Walt became silent
[00:48:59] Lou. My nickname was Red Mike. An example of the use of these nicknames as code words is one night
[00:49:06] the japs put down smoke and the yelled gas. We were too green at the time and two of our companies
[00:49:13] withdrew leaving a company exposed on two flanks. He says a value of night training is that it
[00:49:23] lets men learn the normal noises of the woods at night. Woods are not silent at night. He says the
[00:49:29] Japanese is no Superman. He has the same limitations that we have. They have the advantage of
[00:49:34] experience with proper training. Our Americans are better as our people can think better as individuals.
[00:49:40] Encourage your individuals and bring them out. So this is any team. You either train your team
[00:49:51] to think or train them to obey. Certainly the Japanese leaned toward what they wanted was obedience.
[00:50:04] Both are riflemen and machine gunners must be taught to shoot. I can tell you that's what I got
[00:50:09] shipped all to. Shoot low. This leadership business resolves itself down to being hardboiled.
[00:50:21] By that I mean getting rid of the poor leader even if you like him personally because this is a
[00:50:29] life in death affair. This goes right on down to the non-combs.
[00:50:34] You can see there's no slack for poor leadership. Like you know it's peace time.
[00:50:43] I can tell you when I first got to the to the bears. The amount of seal officers that got
[00:50:54] fired when they were in a seal platoon was very very small. Very small number of seal officers
[00:51:00] that would get fired. Then after the war started it would happen. It would happen. It was not
[00:51:06] like it happened often. But it happened a lot more. It happened a lot more because you'd be looking
[00:51:12] going there. This isn't just an employment over to train someone or this is going to be
[00:51:18] going to war. That was Colonel Letzon. We get to major LOOL WALT commanding officer
[00:51:35] second battalion fifth Marine. There's a note from Colonel Letzon. Colonel Letzon told me that
[00:51:40] Major WALT was one of his best leaders and one of the best men he has ever seen in action.
[00:51:46] Major WALT was a young man of about 35 years of age. He's extremely rugged and looks like a
[00:51:52] full back on a football team. I talked to him over 20 minutes before I was able to make a single
[00:51:57] original note as his ideas seemed to echo Colonel Edson's. So that's pretty cool. You got the
[00:52:07] battalion commander saying all the same stuff that the regimental commander was saying.
[00:52:10] Here's a little report that Major LOOL WALT gives. At 630 PM they smoked our two right
[00:52:20] companies and when the smoke had enveloped these two companies they broke out. They came out in
[00:52:26] mass formation 20 abreast yelling. BANETS fixed automatic weapons working. Rear ranks
[00:52:32] throwing hand grenades. They were trying to escape to the sand pit at the mouth of the river in
[00:52:38] order to cross the river to get back. Our right front company had just completed a double apron
[00:52:45] barbed wire fence. When the Japanese hit the left flank of the right company they killed nine out
[00:52:51] of the first 10 men. Nine out of the first 11 men they hit. Then they hit the barbed wire. Two of our
[00:52:57] heavy machine guns opened up shooting down along this barbed wire fence and dispersed their attack.
[00:53:04] It got dark quickly like it does here. There was smoke. Japs and Marines all mixed up. Three
[00:53:11] Japanese officers were swinging their two hand swords. There was hand-to-hand fighting all night long.
[00:53:19] We mopped them up at Daybreak. We killed 78 Japs. They killed 12 Marines and wounded 26 of us.
[00:53:26] The Jap has a great deal of respect for our hand grenade and it is a valuable weapon to us.
[00:53:36] Do you ever practice throwing it in wooded country? Scary throwing grenades in the woods.
[00:53:46] Because you can hit a tree, you can hit a branch. He says this is always a common theme about the
[00:53:51] Japanese. The Jap is not an individual fighter. He won't fight with a bayonet unless backed up with a
[00:53:56] dozen other Japs. Here's where you get to do this pure leadership. As in the basic
[00:54:06] field manual, each man should know the objective. I make my platoon leader designate an objective
[00:54:14] every 100 yards in the jungle and they work to it and reorganize. They don't push off for the next
[00:54:21] objective until they get word from the company commander. This method we have found ensures
[00:54:25] control. I control my company exactly the same way. I set up objectives for each company when
[00:54:31] the companies reach their objective. They report. After the reorganization we go ahead,
[00:54:37] I think reserves and the attack should be kept up closely. It can be committed immediately.
[00:54:47] Platoon Sergeant CC Ardent. There's a note in here. It says when
[00:54:53] Colonel Edson sent for his best fighters, he did not include Platoon Sergeant Ardent. After I got
[00:54:59] through talking to these men, two of them came up to me and said, Sir, you did not see Sergeant Ardent.
[00:55:06] He has more patrols and does more scouting than any man in the regiment. Could we get him for you,
[00:55:11] Sir? Here we go. CC Ardent. He seems like the kind of guy when I was reading this, I was like,
[00:55:18] I know this kind of dude. So here's this dude. I practice walking quietly over rocks,
[00:55:24] twigs, grass leaves, through vines, etc. I practiced this around the Bivowack area. I received
[00:55:31] instructions in scouting and patrolling in Kwanako, but I still practice this around here in the Bivowack
[00:55:37] area. I believe because I practice this is the reason I'm still alive. Some of the other
[00:55:43] NCOs laughed at me because I'm always seeing how quietly I can walk around because I go out and
[00:55:49] practice on my own, but they have stopped laughing because I have been on more patrols than any
[00:55:55] man in the regiment and I am still alive. When I am scouting and come to an opening in the jungle
[00:56:01] and have to cross it, I generally run across it quickly and quietly, going slow here, make
[00:56:07] cost a scout his life, different types of terrain calls for different methods. So I totally know
[00:56:16] that guy, just obsessed and I love it. Go ahead. Do you think like you did something to do that too?
[00:56:27] You know guys, they stand up and they do like a technical stand, even though you know,
[00:56:32] they're keeping it real. Or when they give you a hug they like fish front. They're always doing
[00:56:38] that the thing, you know. Yeah, but I think this is the guy that's like stand, you know, not just that.
[00:56:47] This is the guy that's and you know, when I when I first got in, actually the whole time I was
[00:56:55] in it was like okay, I got to do this again. I need to do this better. I get to get better with this.
[00:56:58] But I did that kind of in a broad way. Like I kind of wanted to be good at everything, you know?
[00:57:08] Whereas, it'd be like someone, whereas there's some guys that would get really into one thing.
[00:57:15] You know, it'd be like someone that just works on, you know, deep half-guard.
[00:57:21] Maybe just get obsessed with deep half-guard and that's what they're working on. Like that's
[00:57:24] all they're drilling. That's all they're doing. This is Colonel Amor LER Sims.
[00:57:40] Commanding Officer 7th Marines first Marine Division. He says, is the army stripping down to
[00:57:45] essentials and equipment teach not to waste ammunition, learn to make every shot count,
[00:57:50] try to get the japs on the move, keep them bouncing around, don't let them get set.
[00:57:55] When you let them get set they're hard to get out. This is such a good philosophy to have
[00:57:59] whenever you're in a competitive moment against another person or against another business or
[00:58:04] against another team. Don't let them settle. Don't let them, you know, like we talked about earlier,
[00:58:08] you get them out and go for the Amor. Look, sometimes you think, well, get there in a established position.
[00:58:14] I get it. I get that philosophy. But if you can and you can get there and you can go for it.
[00:58:20] You're going to catch them off guard. Don't let them prepare. Go.
[00:58:27] He says, our battalion commanders in the 7th Marines know that in reporting information at once,
[00:58:34] and if they need help to ask for it and not just try to bowl things through,
[00:58:40] that they are enabling regiments to act as a team in the right manner and in the right direction.
[00:58:44] So he's saying, listen, the battalion commanders knew that they needed to get the information, the
[00:58:50] correct information, up the chain of commanders quickly as they could so that they, so that the chain of
[00:58:55] command, the senior leadership could support them. And if you needed help, you needed to ask for it.
[00:59:05] A regimental commander cannot be impatient. Don't push your battalion commanders unless you
[00:59:11] feel there is reluctancy on their part. Our great leader General Vandergrif gives me a job and
[00:59:18] lets me handle the situation with a regiment in my own way. He's not impatient with me.
[00:59:25] Inpatients would ruin the best plans. A mapped plan may not turn out to be feasible, so we have
[00:59:34] learned here not to be impatient. And then he says, it has been impressed upon us here that the
[00:59:45] logistics have to be correctly planned. The science of logistics turns out to be your life logistics,
[00:59:51] winds of ours. Here's the thought I would like to leave you with the regimental commanders.
[00:59:57] Pick your officers for common sense. Basic field manual knowledge is fine, but it is useless
[01:00:06] without common sense. Common sense is of greater value than all the words in the book.
[01:00:12] I am too deep, so that's the statement right there, right? Common sense is not amazing.
[01:00:18] Promote and put in leadership positions people at a common sense. Then he says, I am too deep in my
[01:00:27] battalions and regard to battalion commanding officers. That is, each one of my battalion executive
[01:00:33] officers is a potential battalion commander. The reason for this is if the battalion commander gets
[01:00:38] killed or sick, I won't be caught out on the limb. He says, I make my staff officers get out of this
[01:00:45] CP, not to snoop so that they get out of the command, post and go to the front lines. And he does
[01:00:51] that quote, not to snoop on the troops, but to help the battalions and equate themselves with
[01:00:57] the general situation insist on night training. But don't train day and night. If I were training
[01:01:03] my regiment again, working seven days a week, I would train three nights and four days.
[01:01:09] Our orders to armorans on the perimeter defense are, this is this is kind of epic.
[01:01:13] Our orders to armorans on the perimeter defense are, you stay on your position and do not pull
[01:01:20] back. If they bust through you, we'll plug up the hole, but you stay there.
[01:01:30] And then he says, this regiment can out yell the japs, out fight them, out bayonet them, and out
[01:01:37] shoot them. This yelling as in hand, a hand action is important. It's like a football team that
[01:01:43] talks it up. The japs yell at us. Marines, we're going to kill you. More blood for the emperor.
[01:01:51] The Marines bail back. You blank, blank, blank, blank. That's just as blank. That's a little
[01:01:57] agro-ized. You blank, blank, blank. We'll kill you, japs, more blood for Franklin.
[01:02:10] There's just a yelling at each other. You know, that was like, when we had cowboy on
[01:02:17] and cowboy could hear the North Vietnamese Army commander yelling, hey get ready to get ready to
[01:02:28] assault. And he's telling, telling Lynn Black, here they come. He just gave the order to assault.
[01:02:37] Sometimes that's how right, like if you're close, I think it was late. Who said when they were
[01:02:43] like in a gunfight and they were so close, they were re-helling at each other. Well, you could definitely
[01:02:47] hear people talking. Yeah. I saw I'll have to ask, like, what particular instance that was.
[01:02:55] Yeah, I saw a video on some fights, some army guys, I think in Afghanistan. They're kind,
[01:03:02] it looked like kind of a jungle. There's parts of Afghanistan that look like that. Yeah,
[01:03:06] like not a thick, but like it was like trees in there. And they were in a gunfight and they were,
[01:03:11] you could hear them yelling at it. And I think there isn't a different language and stuff.
[01:03:15] And they were just same deal. Blankety blank. And it's crazy because in football, yeah, that's how too.
[01:03:21] You know, it's like it's all talking trash the whole time. Even the referee is saying hey,
[01:03:26] be quiet, be quiet. No father, every is no factor because he can't do nothing for you. He's talking
[01:03:30] and everyone's yelling at each other. And depends, certain teams are more hostile than others,
[01:03:34] whatever. Just depends on the personality of the team. But yeah, that goes on. But it's all like
[01:03:39] it's all within like sportsmen like, you know, some of its funny, some of its like kind of,
[01:03:46] you know, so there's a sort of, it's kind of the culture, you know. But it's crazy to understand that
[01:03:52] like it's just trying to straighten it and you're trying to kill them. So that blankety blank
[01:03:57] blank is like the real deal, you know. Damn. This next section is about the commanding officer
[01:04:06] of the first battalion seventh regiment US Marines, first Marine Division. You might know who that is.
[01:04:13] It's Lieutenant Colonel Louis B. Polar from podcast. 111, we went through his book, which is called
[01:04:21] Marine in podcast 122. We talked about his son, Louis Polar Jr. So if you want to check out those
[01:04:30] podcasts, there is a podcast that we'll stay with you. We'll put it to you that way.
[01:04:42] So what he says, this is one of the most, yeah, this is the most iconic Marine of all time.
[01:04:48] Chasty Polar. And he says, and this was kind of cool because it's like, this is,
[01:04:55] it's cool because the way this is written, you can tell that this guy was taken notes. Like,
[01:04:58] there was someone there sitting there writing down word for word, what these guys were saying. So
[01:05:02] this is Chasty Polar talking and he says, and handling my companies, I take the company commander's
[01:05:06] word for what is going on. You have to do this to get anywhere. In order to get a true picture of
[01:05:12] what is going on in this heavy country, I take my staff, I make my staff get up to where the fighting
[01:05:19] is. This command post business will ruin the American army and Marines if it isn't watched.
[01:05:25] Hell, our platoons and squads would like a command post in the attack if they are not watched.
[01:05:34] As soon as you set up a command post, all forward movement stops.
[01:05:42] That's a good one. It's a good one to think about mentally for you, for us, for me.
[01:05:48] But when you soon as you set up a command post like, okay, I'm good, I'm good in this spot.
[01:05:53] I'm not forward progress stops. Don't do it.
[01:05:59] He says the walkie talkie that Japs have operates. Why can't we have a similar one?
[01:06:07] The menu says this to hell with the telephone wire advancing with the troops. We can't carry
[01:06:12] enough wire. We received an order. This advance, the advance will stop until the wire gets in.
[01:06:19] This is backwards. Because they didn't have good radio communications, they would run a wire
[01:06:28] an actual wire so they could talk to each other on these little field telephones.
[01:06:33] Well, obviously it's not easy to run that wire out there. You've seen movies of guys. They got
[01:06:38] the little wire and a real run and out of waiting and getting shot. I mean, it's a don't nightmare.
[01:06:43] But then you get these commanders saying, hey, don't advance anymore until you get the wire position.
[01:06:47] And Chessi's like, look, we know where we're going. Let us go. He said this staffs are twice as
[01:06:55] large as they should be. The reds of metal staff is too large. I have five staff officers in the
[01:07:00] battalion and I could get along with less. The officers have to dress and look like the men.
[01:07:06] One time the commander of the Marine Corps asked me why our patrols failed in Haiti. I replied
[01:07:10] because the officer's bedding role. In Haiti at that time, the officer had to have a pack
[01:07:16] meal and the enlisted men saw the officers lying around in luxury. The patrols were actually
[01:07:22] held up for this pack meal. Your leaders have to be upfront. Those that won't get up there
[01:07:29] and are not in physical shape to keep up with the men will cause plans to fail.
[01:07:37] It's okay to say that an outfit cannot be surprised. But it is bound to happen in this type of warfare.
[01:07:43] So, therefore, your outfits must know what to do when ambushed. So, he said like, hey, look,
[01:07:50] you can say, hey, we're not going to get surprised. But guess what? You are. So, you better know what to do.
[01:07:55] Then he says, calling back commanding officers to batowing in regimental
[01:08:00] CPs to say, how are things going? Is awful. That's his statement. That's a complete statement.
[01:08:05] If you call me back from the front line to say, how's that going? It's awful.
[01:08:10] Each company is responsible for its flank. This is a time tested and proven formation which worked.
[01:08:17] If attacked from the flank face and adjust, the good little thing to think about.
[01:08:28] In marching or in camp, I just noticed like, now that I'm reading chesty puller, I'm getting
[01:08:31] more fired up. I'm channeling chesty. In marching or in camp, I think I'm doing what I think he
[01:08:39] sounded like. In marching or in camp, we've learned here that you must have an all-around defense.
[01:08:48] There you go. He's just making statements. He's not even, he's just, he's just rattling things off.
[01:08:53] We need more entrenching shovels. Give shovels to the men who have wire cutters. You need both
[01:08:58] wire cutter and shovels. I wish we had the M1 rifle and when we get relieved from Guadalcanal,
[01:09:05] I'm going to make every effort to get it. I consider it my imperative that the army and marines
[01:09:14] be equipped with knee mortars and only carry one type grenade. Have the hand grenade fit in the knee
[01:09:19] mortar and be of use as a hand grenade and also as a rifle grenade. You need a rifle grenade
[01:09:25] or an east squad for uses against enemy machine gunness. I didn't, in some of the other guys, I
[01:09:33] kind of skip through some of their when it gets starts getting real granular, but I wasn't
[01:09:38] going to skip Chastipolar because Chastipolar. The following is the result and the so that's it.
[01:09:46] That's what we get from Chastipolar. But then the following is the result of a conference with five
[01:09:51] of the best NCOs in the first battalion of the seventh marines. These NCOs were selected by Lieutenant
[01:09:57] Colonel, Polar. Here's some comments from them. The Japanese fire is not always aimed. It is
[01:10:02] harassing fire and scares recruits. Get the recruits so they are used to overhead fire.
[01:10:08] Japs who have infiltrated signal to each other with their rifles by the number of shots.
[01:10:16] We get these birds by constantly patrolling. He says if one of the guys say,
[01:10:24] if you shoot their officers, they mill around talking about the Japanese. If you shoot their officers,
[01:10:29] they mill around their NCOs or poor. You can tell their officers by their sabers and their letter
[01:10:35] leather patees, which is like some kind of legging. I had to look that word up. Platees, PUTT, EES.
[01:10:43] It's like a legging. But this is again, this is something that you hear a lot about the Japanese.
[01:10:48] Is that once their officers are dead, they because they're very centralized command, micro
[01:10:54] managed. So if you killed their officers, all of a sudden the rest of the troops are just kind of
[01:10:59] milling around. They don't know what to do. Lieutenant Shepherd 7th Marines also promoted on the
[01:11:08] field of battle. We salute you Lieutenant Shepherd. I would stress in training teamwork between
[01:11:17] the leaders and all units. Leaize on between support plans and all leaders. Leaize on between
[01:11:21] artillery and the infantry. If I were training my unit again, I would really have some high class
[01:11:25] patrol training. I would do everything with these patrols. I could possibly think of to include
[01:11:30] losing them and making them go across country without maps or compasses. The Japanese do a lot of
[01:11:38] yelling at times and at other times they are deadly silent. One night, some Japanese got in our
[01:11:44] marching column. We discovered them and bayoneted them. At another time, I heard I myself heard
[01:11:52] a Japanese yell in good English, K company, forward. The japs don't like our men yelling back at them.
[01:12:04] Okay, next week at two, Master Gunnery Sergeant R. M. foul 7th Marines and he's 24 years
[01:12:09] of service. He said, we've learned not to get excited or go off half-cocked where there's noise.
[01:12:15] The Japanese make noise to mislead us. They shot off some firecrackers at the start, but we have
[01:12:22] learned that where the noise is, he ain't. You never hear a move. He sleeps in the daytime and
[01:12:28] does his work at night. Officer's an NCOs during shelling should move around and talk to the men.
[01:12:38] Quiet them down. If you don't do this, some of them will walk around with their fingers on their
[01:12:43] triggers and they get to imagining things. And along this line, we learned to post double sentinels,
[01:12:51] one man to quiet another. Sheesh. Imagine that. You got to put two people on watch because you
[01:12:57] got one of them's going to freak out. All my time in the Marines, I've seen men bunch up.
[01:13:05] And I've talked about this and make my NCOs talk about this all the time. The men seem to
[01:13:11] fear separation. I talked about that in leadership strategy in chat. They said, I don't
[01:13:14] hold section called don't bunch up. And I don't didn't just talk about it from the battlefield
[01:13:20] perspective, but what happens is the way I, the reason I had to talk about it in there is because
[01:13:24] yes, people bunch up on the battlefield and they do it because they're afraid. And because you want
[01:13:29] to hear, you want to be close. I want to get to you to hear what you have. What's going on?
[01:13:33] What happened from a leadership perspective is people bunch up mentally from the lead. So echo,
[01:13:42] you have an idea. I like to crowd in with your idea and put my ideas in there. We want to get together.
[01:13:46] We want to talk. We're going to give our input. It's like, man, give that person some space.
[01:13:52] Let that plan develop a little bit. Don't bunch up. Don't crowd it.
[01:13:56] This one says the Japs are man monkeys and they run around considerable. In order to compete with
[01:14:06] these man monkeys from Japan, you got to be an excellent shape and you've got to be tough. We can
[01:14:13] lick them and we are doing it all the time. So yeah, we say and they're like in great shape and they're
[01:14:19] able to move around through the jungle very quickly. Well, I suppose it's like when when Joe
[01:14:24] Rogan calls some fighter like a gorilla or whatever, right? Yeah, or a monster. Yeah, monster animal.
[01:14:32] Yeah, because the animal. Check man monkeys. Lieutenant Colonel Frisbee, executive officer
[01:14:40] seventh Marines. I hope the army is being toughened up. We toughened up by bivowacking, not camping
[01:14:49] at the combat ranges. We lived at these combat ranges in order to teach platoon to keep off the road.
[01:14:54] We made platoon's march in the field alongside the road when they moved from one combat area to another.
[01:15:01] Hey, what's bivowacking? Sleeping in the woods? Not camping, but you know, setting up a small area
[01:15:13] to sleep in. You're not like put pitching attend. It's like a just a make shift sort of
[01:15:20] we're going to sleep here. Good for you. Not even a camp, like less. So just kind of firstly
[01:15:25] been for rest. Yeah. It's not like in a bad way or necessarily good way, just like to get sleep.
[01:15:31] Like hey, we've been patrolling. All right, we're in a good spot. Hey, we're going to be vowackier
[01:15:34] for the night. Okay, you know, half guys on security, other half guys get, you know, put your head down.
[01:15:40] Get some sleep. Yeah. It's probably a good defensive old position.
[01:15:48] Here's Lieutenant Colonel N. H. Han Khan. Second battalion, seven therines, and by the way,
[01:15:57] metal of honor from Haiti. It pays in the attack in the jungle to use the heavy machine guns.
[01:16:06] There is a difference of opinion as you've noticed on this matter. It's hard work. Yes, but don't
[01:16:12] overlook the value. Moral and otherwise, and don't forget about the high rate of fire. If you did
[01:16:19] to heavy machine guns and substitute the lights in their place, you must remember that you will be
[01:16:24] up against the Japanese machine guns. As we all know, a huge fan of machine guns. Yeah. And apparently
[01:16:34] so is Lieutenant Colonel. Be careful about withdrawing the men unless all the men know what it's
[01:16:39] about. If you don't do this, you're level to make the men panicky. We already talked about that.
[01:16:43] Mob mentality can happen. You must realize that there is such a thing as not attacking win
[01:16:49] order to do so. We have got to get to a point where the men go ahead, win order and damn the
[01:16:58] highing the most. Corpals must be indoctrinated with leadership to overcome this and all ranks
[01:17:05] have got to have the hate. Like I said, this is a different time, man. You're going against a different
[01:17:13] enemy. So we're talking about you have to hate the enemy. That's where we're at.
[01:17:20] There's a conference with three second lieutenant and five old NCOs of second to tie in
[01:17:30] seventh Marines. The basic principle of leadership in the US Marine Corps is that the individual
[01:17:35] is told of his responsibility in different situations and is held to it.
[01:17:43] You got to have confidence in each other. When signals to move forward are given, you must have
[01:17:47] confidence that the men next to you will move forward even if you cannot see them.
[01:17:53] We have that kind of confidence in this battalion.
[01:17:59] There's a quote here which I am in full agreement with. It says, we love the heavy machine gun
[01:18:06] period. We have two American Indians. We use as talkers on the telephone or voice radio when we
[01:18:17] want to transmit secret or important messages. It's awesome. Be mean and kill them.
[01:18:25] Kill them dead are platoon. Our motto in this platoon is no prisoners.
[01:18:37] Second lieutenant, D.A. Clark, seventh Marines. Promoted on the field of battle. This officer
[01:18:44] was interviewed in the hospital where he was recuperating from wounds. We have a lot of trouble in my
[01:18:50] platoon with water discipline. We also have trouble with men bunching up in order to talk to each other.
[01:18:55] They seem to do this even though it means death.
[01:19:02] Major abuse assistant G3 on the general vandagriff staff. We have had to multiply our unit of fire
[01:19:11] in hand grenades by five. The yellow color on hand grenades is poor. Why can't they just be painted
[01:19:19] black as the yellow color enables the japs or throw them back? You ever seen that color combination?
[01:19:27] It's in a very very common in the military. It's like an olive drab, but then the writing is
[01:19:32] in yellow. And like even the grades, no one listen to this guy because the grenade still have
[01:19:35] like a yellow band around them. It's not like a bright yellow, but it's definitely yellow.
[01:19:43] Wait, why is that? Why is it yellow? That's just how they mark them. I mean, there's no particular
[01:19:49] reason. It looks kind of dope. I almost actually leadership strategy and tactics. Almost went.
[01:19:55] In fact, the reason I didn't go because it's olive drab, the reason I didn't go that same exact yellow
[01:20:01] is because you couldn't really read it clearly enough. That's kind of a bummer. I should have just stuck with it.
[01:20:06] Yeah, like claim more my declaim or my third yellow.
[01:20:09] Back where it says front towards enemy? Yeah, actually. Yeah yellow. I think. Yeah.
[01:20:15] Yeah, so it's very good. It's the common thing. It's the common stencil color is this olive drab green
[01:20:20] and it's a faded yellow. It's like a drab yellow. Yeah. Just. He says this. I am being sent back
[01:20:31] for arrest. We have been in action continually here from August 7, 1942 until this date,
[01:20:37] November 26, 1942. What we all marvel at is how general vandagrift can stand it so much better than
[01:20:44] we do. It must be his character. I want to do like a full-on podcast on general vandagrift.
[01:20:53] Major Ben J. Northridge, CO2, but I am 164th Infantry. If I could train my men over again,
[01:21:04] I would put officers and men in slit trenches and drop bombs nearby to overcome fear.
[01:21:11] We were all scared to death at first. Let's overcome this fear. How about firing some
[01:21:16] captured 25 caliber ammunition out of captured rifles to let officers and men know the sound?
[01:21:21] Also captured job machine guns ammunition out of their captured machine guns.
[01:21:28] Gotta get used to that sound. Luckily we do. Luckily we have AK47s. We can do that. No problem.
[01:21:34] No factor. We know what that AK sounds like. Lieutenant Colonel Frank Richards, CEO, first
[01:21:39] battalion 164th Infantry. He says, if I were training my battalion again, I would have training
[01:21:46] in patience. I would have patrols wait for the enemy to expose himself. They move around too.
[01:21:55] They have to relieve themselves and they have to get food. I would have the men in this patient's
[01:22:01] training made be made to sit still for hours at a time.
[01:22:06] Captain John A. Gosset, CEO, company H, 164th Infantry. Teach the men the capacities of the hand grenade
[01:22:22] and handling men. Isn't that crazy, dude? This guy is here in Guadalcanal and here's the two
[01:22:30] notes that he's got. He said, you got to learn the capacities of hand grenades and have a handle
[01:22:34] men. I thought I knew how to handle men, but since I've been here, I have revised my ideas as I have
[01:22:41] learned a great deal. I have learned the primitive rough and tumble way. You can't pat all men on the
[01:22:48] back. You have to be rough with some men in order to get results. It is not my nature to be rough,
[01:22:54] but I am forcing myself and I have learned which of my men I can pat on the back and which I
[01:23:00] have to deal with in the hardest manner. Everyone's the same, everyone's different. Captain John A.
[01:23:11] Dawson, commanding officer, company B. 164th Infantry. If I could train my company again,
[01:23:19] I would have some maneuvers on which the men were deprived of food, water, and comforts in order
[01:23:25] to find out which NCOs and men can't take it. I would relieve these people. This type of maneuver
[01:23:31] would teach men to know and expect hardships. It will lessen the shock when they come up against
[01:23:37] the real thing in the presence of the enemy. It is important that the entire squad note
[01:23:44] know how to operate the BAR, not just two men, reason, think of the BAR men who are wounded,
[01:23:50] get killed and become sick and have to be evacuated. We've tenant John S. Graves,
[01:24:00] Platoon Leader, company C. 164th Infantry. The biggest thing I have learned since I hit this island
[01:24:06] is that leadership and initiative is so important here. The Platoon Leader can only be in one spot
[01:24:11] at a time and men must be trained to act correctly on their own. I've never seen this type of training.
[01:24:22] Yes, decentralized command. That's just post that on your brain. Sergeant W. V. Demos, squad leader,
[01:24:38] company C. 164th Infantry. Sir, I would like to say that there is no place for recruits here.
[01:24:44] We need trained soldiers who have initiative and know what is the right thing to do.
[01:24:51] The jungle is so thick that squad leaders cannot get around all of the time to see men and tell
[01:24:57] them what to do. This is the common theme. This is Colonel B. E. Moore, commanding officer 164th
[01:25:08] Infantry. Note, when I saw Colonel Moore, he was interviewing a patrol and patrol leader who had
[01:25:13] just come back. They had been on a reconnaissance for 15 hours. The patrol leader had been met
[01:25:18] at an advanced position and as he had valuable information of the enemy, he was conducted by
[01:25:26] Jeep to the observation post of the artillery where he directed artillery fire. Then returned to
[01:25:31] the Colonel where he made his report. The patrol and its leader were nearly exhausted.
[01:25:36] Colonel Moore had on hand a small sample bottle of brandy which he issued one small sample
[01:25:46] bottle to each two men. He made them dilute this brandy with water in their canteen cups.
[01:25:52] It was noticeable that this helped them. The following interview took place after the patrol had
[01:25:59] been dismissed. One could not be around Colonel Moore very long without realizing that he
[01:26:06] is a leader and regimental commander in every sense of the word. Taking care of his people.
[01:26:19] When he says, the greatest problem is leaders and you have to find some way to weed out the week ones.
[01:26:28] The patrol tuners who cannot command, who cannot force things and you cannot act on the spur of
[01:26:34] the moment in an emergency are a distinct detriment. Leadership.
[01:26:44] This is the last thing we're going to read from this book. He says, many of the junior leaders
[01:26:51] have not used their heads at times and they're training. I recommend you put them up against
[01:26:57] situations where they must use their heads. He says, the good leaders seem to get killed.
[01:27:06] The poor leaders get the men killed. The big problem is leadership and getting the shoulder straps
[01:27:12] on the right people. Not one man in 50 can lead a patrol in the jungle. If you can find out who
[01:27:18] the good patrol leaders are before you hit the combat zone, you have found out something.
[01:27:22] I have had to get rid of about 25 officers because they just weren't leaders. I had to make
[01:27:30] the battalion commander weed out the poor junior leaders. This process is continuous. Our junior
[01:27:36] leaders are finding out that they must know more about their men. The good leaders know their men.
[01:27:56] Obviously, that's not new. We've heard it before. In fact, we've heard all this before.
[01:28:03] What's crazy is they'd all heard it before. Right? These principles have been around.
[01:28:12] These principles have been around forever. They still had to re-learn those lessons
[01:28:18] and they still had to make every effort like this manual to pass those lessons on.
[01:28:26] What should we do? Well, what we should do is we should make our best effort
[01:28:38] to receive those lessons. Remember those lessons just as we should remember these brave men
[01:28:47] who learn these lessons in blood. What do you got echoed, Charles?
[01:29:01] I always, like, so there's kind of two ways you can go with all of this stuff where it's like
[01:29:06] you hear it over and over and over again, right? Which should sort of reinforce it. So you kind of
[01:29:11] got to be careful to not regard it. I guess maybe this happens subconsciously sometimes. Where you
[01:29:19] just, you know, you hear something over and over again and then it just becomes sort of just noise like
[01:29:23] already know that. You know what's weird about me? Yeah, I know a lot of things.
[01:29:30] When you say that, like, I can't relate to it because every time I hear these things,
[01:29:35] I'm like, there it is. I'm like, there it is. It's a reinforcement. It's a, it's a, it's a hearing
[01:29:40] to get it. It's a little bit of different thing about I know what that means. You know, like that
[01:29:44] last little section is so crazy to read that. It's so crazy to read that. This guy is saying,
[01:29:50] in training you, I recommend you put them in situations where they must use their heads.
[01:29:55] Like, I teach that all the time. That's long front. We're like, oh, you want to train your
[01:29:58] leaders. You got to put, you can't give your leaders problems that there is a wrote,
[01:30:02] member, memorable solution to. You actually want to make them think. I always bring up a story with
[01:30:08] the Germans. The Germans would give their subordinate leaders in training. They would give them
[01:30:15] problems that could only be solved if they broke the rules, which means there's no format to
[01:30:21] what they're getting them to try and do. So how can you get your people? You need to put your
[01:30:26] people in situations where they need to think. So every time I look, and this is a lesson that I've
[01:30:29] taught before, but I hear it. I'm like, there it is. Yeah, maybe because you like, apply it,
[01:30:35] it may be often or maybe it made such an impact for because of your experiences and stuff,
[01:30:41] or maybe both, I don't know. But so it's always sticking with you. So you're always looking
[01:30:46] to like, reinforce, to make it better to improve on this very thing that you're actually practicing.
[01:30:52] Yeah, you know what's interesting? So my last three years in the terms, I was running that training.
[01:30:57] So I got to see, and I always say that the training that I ran was the best leadership laboratory
[01:31:05] in the history of the world. And I would be willing to go toe to toe and anyone that thinks that
[01:31:09] they've seen them better. I'm not not not to fight them, but I would be interested
[01:31:13] if there was someone else that says, oh, we did, we had a leadership situation where this is what
[01:31:18] we got to see. And therefore we have a really good understanding of leadership as well. I'm sure
[01:31:25] there's other things that are out there. I'm telling you, when I was running that training,
[01:31:30] it was freaking awesome. Because you're seeing platoon after platoon after platoon, after platoon,
[01:31:37] with different leadership, you could see the good leadership versus the bad leadership. You see what
[01:31:41] work, what didn't work, it was the best leadership laboratory. And I learned, if I got to take the
[01:31:48] lessons that I learned and see them applied. And when they applied them well, the things would go,
[01:31:54] well, if they didn't apply well, things would go bad. So obvious. It was so obvious. And what's
[01:31:59] interesting is now at Esslope Front, I kind of get to do the same thing because it's, hey,
[01:32:06] I work with the business. Here's what's happening in their market. Here's what's happening in
[01:32:09] their expansion. Here's what's happening as they grow. So we get to see, oh, here's the leadership.
[01:32:13] Here's what you need to do. And then I, it's like, this is what the mistake that you're making.
[01:32:18] This is where you need to move. And so I like you said, I'm very lucky because I continue to get
[01:32:24] to work directly in this environment that I've been completely and utterly engaged in for, you know,
[01:32:35] I mean, for a long, long, for decades. And yet, that I guess maybe that's why when I see these things,
[01:32:44] I think to myself, like, guess, like, I get, it just, just more reinforcement.
[01:32:50] And yeah, so you like it. What? Like straight out, like, okay, so we'll call this, maybe over
[01:32:59] simplifying it, leadership, right? Do I like it? Yeah. Are you serious, right? I mean,
[01:33:05] I absolutely love it. Okay. I love it. And you know what? I love it in the way that
[01:33:10] what I love about it is it is a continual challenge to it's, it's solving a problem and getting the
[01:33:21] grad. It's kind of like jujitsu in that you get out there, you learn to move, you see,
[01:33:24] move, you use the move, it works, it doesn't work, you make adjustments on it. It's a very similar
[01:33:32] thing. But yeah, I love it because it's super complex and yet it's super simple, right?
[01:33:39] And the gratification is extraordinary because people, you know, like people say, I did what you
[01:33:51] just told me to do, you know, I didn't last meeting and Fred's on board now and you're like,
[01:33:55] that's awesome. And this was a problem for someone that was a legitimate, not just a challenge,
[01:34:03] but like a threat to their lifestyle, right? A threat to their business, a threat to their corporation.
[01:34:09] And you're like, hey, here's this, here's, okay, do this, report back. Let me hear what you got.
[01:34:15] Okay, here's the report. Okay, here's the reaction. Okay, good. That means continuing moving this
[01:34:19] round. No, that means going over in this direction. So to be able to be lucky enough
[01:34:25] to take all these lessons that I learned and be able to apply them on a daily basis,
[01:34:32] it's ridiculous. It's freaking awesome because like it's, do you like leadership? Well, I
[01:34:38] knew the answer and maybe it was kind of a semi-retortical question, but if, because some people
[01:34:45] they don't, they don't like it. They see it as an necessity and stuff like that, but they don't
[01:34:50] really like it. So and then it's a spectrum for sure. It's like sales, you know, like sales, for
[01:34:55] example, where some people, they just love it and every little tip, every little thing, every little
[01:35:00] like established, like element of successful state, they're all about it. No, people can be in all
[01:35:07] kinds of stuff. Yeah, you did too. Guitar, drawing, or reading. I mean, yeah, so if there is a certain
[01:35:14] philosophical element that is like with stud to test the time and the reading here reading
[01:35:20] there is a man, it's going to reinforce a thing. They're going to be into it and it's going to
[01:35:24] be just in their head. They're going to apply it any chance that they get, even if it's this
[01:35:28] much of a little development, they're going to apply it. Boom, it's ready. It's down because they
[01:35:33] enjoy it and that's part of their jam. But if, let's say you don't really like it, it's like a
[01:35:39] chore or whatever, right? You know, there's certain, in tight, there are introvert type people who are
[01:35:44] in a leadership position who kind of don't like it. They'd rather someone else do it with a
[01:35:48] people or something like this, right? Sure. And then so those are the ones that might be, I don't know,
[01:35:54] but they might be the ones that are going to be making these mistakes over and over again because
[01:35:58] they're not consciously actively trying to implement these lessons that are just in someone like
[01:36:04] your case, just straight up being reinforced. But for them, it's almost like not even getting
[01:36:09] it. It's kind of like, I heard that before, whatever, I heard that before, whatever, I'm too busy,
[01:36:12] like not caring almost in a way, like I'm too busy like caring about the things that I care
[01:36:16] about and like. Yeah, I think I think where, oh, there's a lot of misconceptions and I wrote
[01:36:21] about this and leadership strategy in tactics. But here, it's all like the cover flap or whatever.
[01:36:32] Leadership is the most challenging of human endeavors. It is often misunderstood. It can be
[01:36:37] bewildered, mystified, and frustrated, even the most dedicated practitioners. Leaders at all levels
[01:36:43] are often forced to use theoretical guesswork to make decisions and be their troops. It doesn't
[01:36:50] have to be that way. There are principles that can be applied and tenants that can be followed.
[01:36:56] There are skills that can be learned and maneuvers that can be practiced and executed.
[01:37:01] There are leadership strategies and tactics that have been tested and proven on the battlefield
[01:37:06] in business and in life. So that's what I think people miss out on. Is they miss out on the fact
[01:37:12] that it's kind of like any skillset that you want to learn. You want to learn how to play guitar.
[01:37:23] You've got to learn the chords. You've got to learn notes. You want to learn GJT or you've got to
[01:37:28] learn an on-walk. You've got to learn how to play basketball. You've got to learn how to triple.
[01:37:32] You couldn't expect, why would anybody expect that they could walk out on a basketball court
[01:37:35] without ever practicing and be good at it? Now let me ask you this. Have you ever watched
[01:37:43] some like a skate border or a BMX guy or a mountain biker or a surfer and been like,
[01:37:51] oh that looks you think in your weird mind that you could actually do what they're doing.
[01:37:55] That's not the skateboarding guys, but yeah the other guys are crazy.
[01:38:00] But you think oh like oh I can see myself doing that. So I think people look at leadership sometimes
[01:38:07] and there's things that are happening. Oh yeah I would do the same thing or whatever. It looks
[01:38:11] easier than it is. Yeah. And so you have to be careful of that. And maybe that's why I continue
[01:38:18] to enjoy reading and learning about it because I see how hard it is. I see every day when a
[01:38:26] challenge it is for people. So if I can take one thing away from a book that I can use as a tool
[01:38:31] to help someone else maneuver through a challenging leadership situation, I love it. I love adding
[01:38:38] that capability. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense to me. So speaking of learning and improving and getting
[01:38:47] better. What other suggestions might you have for us? Mr. Yeah kind of like me.
[01:38:54] Echo. Zane. Charles. Kind of like me saying hey exercise will help they improve every other
[01:39:02] aspect of your life. True. Unlike any other thing or whatever. True. True. No that thing. Sure
[01:39:06] I'll say it over and over again or whatever helps reinforce it. Hopefully it doesn't become noise.
[01:39:14] I'll give you some credit now for taking what I just said which is a pretty meaning for moment.
[01:39:21] And what you just said is you're going to continue to read the same stuff over and over again on the
[01:39:25] support section of the podcast. What's good for the goose is good for the.
[01:39:29] The guy on the show what I'm saying anyway we're working out. That's going to improve your life.
[01:39:34] Hmm. Health. What if you just tried to say things in a different way sometime?
[01:39:38] Like maybe people would be more interested in it. It's possible.
[01:39:43] It's possible. Unless we are still working out regardless. I always say it. Yeah. I worked out
[01:39:50] today. It's bots. What? Oh. Good job. I had plups today. Yeah. By the way, we're in the process of the
[01:40:00] let's call it the new garage gym of justice. We are probably two months out. Maybe right now. So
[01:40:07] we're getting there. Yeah. If anybody, if anybody, you know, maybe a year and a half ago,
[01:40:14] there was a transition where I was, I moved into a temporary holding facility for myself.
[01:40:20] So that meant a temporary workout facility in my home. And that was all a strategic move
[01:40:30] to long-term and have a much better sort of facility facility.
[01:40:36] Yes. So we're getting there. I'm looking forward to unveiling that. I might even do, you know,
[01:40:42] the, I'll get people as I say, hey, show us your gym tour. Like gym tour.
[01:40:46] Really? Well, I'll say what. I will, when I, when the new gym is complete or at least like when
[01:40:54] it's kind of getting close, we'll do a little, we'll do a little facility tour. Yeah. So you're
[01:41:00] thinking, so what are you going to do? Or you're saying a month or two months. Maybe two and a half.
[01:41:10] No, maybe two. We should, we're getting there. We're getting close. There you go.
[01:41:13] We're getting close. So improvements across the board. Straight up facilities,
[01:41:18] personal health, all that stuff. That's good for it. So we're looking for as one. We're going
[01:41:22] for anyway. We've got supplements for you. If you need them, which, you know, need, you know,
[01:41:28] that's a spectrum, but this thing will 100% help you. Yeah. I'm going to go and say that you
[01:41:34] pro, you need. You need to get joint warfare and acrylic oil. For sure. Yeah. I'm not sure of it.
[01:41:41] Well, if you're listening to this podcast, which means you're getting after it. Right. Okay.
[01:41:44] If you're not listening to this, which we don't care, you're, you then you don't need it. Right.
[01:41:50] Sure. You legitimately don't, because you're like on your own program. You're probably watching TV.
[01:41:53] You don't need joint warfare and superkill if you're, to, to, to strengthen your thumb to press
[01:41:59] the remote control. You're not little bit different. Yeah. You, you can just get whatever.
[01:42:03] More, more french fries, more cheetos. That's what you can get. If you're in the game,
[01:42:09] you may want to get superkill, you may want. Yeah. You should, you need to get superkill.
[01:42:15] You need to get to it. Warfare. And the reason I say need is because if you don't take it,
[01:42:19] you have issues. That's it. Don't just get, get away from the issues. Yeah. Yeah. It's like one of
[01:42:26] those things like you ever play a, uh, you played soccer before. Yeah. All right. So,
[01:42:30] you're a baseball football, right? You, you wear a certain kind of shoes. Go on. Cleats. Really?
[01:42:34] Cleats. So, when you, when you go play, when you suit up, you put on your cleats. Yeah.
[01:42:40] You don't put on tennis shoes. No. I mean, look, is it possible to put on tennis shoes?
[01:42:45] Do you need cleat? That's the thing. Do you need cleats?
[01:42:48] Depends on what you mean by me, right? Exactly. And that's exactly what I'm saying. Okay.
[01:42:52] So, clarification accepted. Look, if you want to stay on this path and not worry about your
[01:42:58] joints giving out on you and they can. Oh, they can get it. Give out on you for sure. They can
[01:43:03] bother you. Ack. They can ache when you're not even exercising straight up. They can. But if you don't
[01:43:08] want to worry about that kind of stuff, that's when you take the joint warfare in the superkill,
[01:43:12] 100%. It's taking every day. Like I do every single day. So far, since our last talk.
[01:43:18] Anyway, glad you've tightened it up. Yes, sir. Also, discipline and discipline go kind of the same thing,
[01:43:26] just different delivery, different modalities and delivery. Yes, sir. Big time. So, yeah.
[01:43:32] You know, the powder, there's the powder, there's the pill, there's the energy drink. I'm just
[01:43:36] call it energy drink. Healthy energy drink. Even though it's barely related to the common,
[01:43:43] what's commonly considered an energy drink. Right. When I think of energy drink, I think, oh,
[01:43:48] massive amount of sugar, massive amount of caffeine, massive amount of chemicals to keep it
[01:43:53] from going, getting spoiled. That's what I think of when I think of an energy drink. And I think of
[01:43:59] a pink orange and yellow can. That it's in. Yeah. That's what I think of. So that's an energy drink.
[01:44:07] Now, it is a very strange to say that what we have, which has no sugar, it's sweetened with monk fruit.
[01:44:17] It's got 95 milligrams of caffeine. So it's got caffeine in it, but that's the same as a
[01:44:23] cup of coffee. It's not some crazy amount that gets you all psycho, jittery. And you have a bit
[01:44:28] crash from. And there's no preservatives in it because we pasteurize it. So what we're really talking
[01:44:34] about are two totally different things. One of them has a bunch of bad stuff in it. The other one
[01:44:38] has a bunch of good stuff in it. Yes. So why are they both called energy drinks? I'm not 100% sure.
[01:44:45] One of them should be called an energy drink. The other one should be called poison.
[01:44:49] Next question. Not to get too analytical on here, but I think I know why. Because you and, you know,
[01:45:01] some of us, we think of energy drinks not as what the whole energy drink, we just think of the stigma.
[01:45:07] Not just the stigma, but the stigma is a very significant portion of the show. Rightly so, by the way,
[01:45:13] put some, if there's some stuff that's straight up bad for you, that should mean something.
[01:45:18] Yeah. That's what I think. So, you know, you think about those kind of things, or at least so like I said,
[01:45:23] but you know, they're like hippy people that will say like, oh, that's bad energy.
[01:45:28] Yeah, that's different. So now I'm kind of feeling like there's such a thing as like bad energy drinks.
[01:45:32] They like that drink as bad energy. We're at the good energy. And that's lean energy. To me,
[01:45:36] that's in play too. I think so. So, you know, if you consider the stigma of energy drinks and it's not
[01:45:42] an unfair stigma, it's not fair. The daikurits. Fair stigma. If you consider that, and you associate it with
[01:45:50] the word energy drink. Yes, when you look at jocco, discipline, go citrus, cycle, jocco, all these flavors.
[01:45:57] If you look at that, then yeah, they're not going to be very similar in that way. Because we don't have
[01:46:04] the stigma over here. No stigma energy drink without the stigma. How about that? There you go. There you go.
[01:46:09] Boom. Look at that one on joccofuel.com. You like that one. Yes, a joccofuel.com. That's
[01:46:16] we can get it. That's that's part of origin. Main. Yeah, come talk kind of the same deal. You can also
[01:46:21] get them at wawwaw the energy drinks. The stigma, the unstigma stigma, stigma less energy drink at
[01:46:29] wawaw and the vitamin shop as well. Also mok mok. I forget about mok vitamin D. Three cold war
[01:46:37] jocco white tea. I'm Dr. Axi drinkin somewhere. That white tea right now. Drinkin some of that.
[01:46:41] And I'm drinking a discipline. Go so I'm kind of getting after it. Vitamin shop wawaw and origin
[01:46:46] main.com. Also got some we talked about jiu jitsu a little bit today. Fortunately, let's say it was not
[01:46:52] required to be put into use in guadal canal. Right, luckily we still had we had our bayonet. We were
[01:46:59] able to just stab people in the neck and didn't have to choke them. But had it been required. We're
[01:47:03] happy that people were trained in jiu jitsu. And we even if we don't have to use it, even if you
[01:47:11] don't have to use it ever in your life in a real situation, believe me you're going to want to
[01:47:16] have it. So train some jiu jitsu and when you train jiu jitsu, you're going to want a ghee to train in
[01:47:23] you're going to want a rash guard to train in and you're going to want those things to be made
[01:47:27] in America. And you're also going to want them. Like you're going to want the best possible ones
[01:47:33] that you could get because you're kind of making a commitment in your life to jiu jitsu. You're going
[01:47:37] to look at yourself in the mirror and say, you know what, we're going to do this. We're going to gain
[01:47:41] a skill that will help you in all aspects of my life. Do you ever or you know how like you look at
[01:47:47] yourself and you kind of have like a little bit of an identity, varying levels of identity,
[01:47:53] whatever. Do you part of that identity are you like a jiu jitsu person for me? Yeah. I would say yes.
[01:48:00] Yes. Yeah. But see how you just said I would say yes. Some because it's a spectrum for sure.
[01:48:05] And not one one is not better than the other by the way. Well, the reason I said that is because
[01:48:11] when we've talked about this on the podcast, if it wasn't here's why I actually it's just
[01:48:15] a yes because if it wasn't for jiu jitsu, I wouldn't have be where I am because I wouldn't have
[01:48:21] been able to figure out a bunch of stuff. Like jiu jitsu for me, the physical part, the knowing
[01:48:26] how to submit people or whatever that is as far as what I got from jiu jitsu, this is going to sound
[01:48:34] crazy. That part, the actual being able to fight and beat people up of all the beneficial things I
[01:48:41] got from jiu jitsu, that part is 20%. The 80% benefit that I got from jiu jitsu was an understanding of the
[01:48:50] world. Now it ties into combat, it ties into leadership and that those things also participated in
[01:48:57] providing me with that 80%. But the jiu jitsu was the factor that allowed me to see it.
[01:49:04] Yeah. So yeah, that makes sense. I think I would agree with that. So yes, I'm a jiu jitsu person.
[01:49:10] Yeah. So yeah, I feel like if I look my identity, I'm not not a jiu jitsu person, but I'm not like
[01:49:17] I'm a jiu jitsu person. If you meet someone, someone's not going to be like, oh yeah, that's a jiu jitsu
[01:49:24] guy. That's not the first thing they're going to say. You're not known as a jiu jitsu guy. Yeah.
[01:49:29] But people know you do jiu. Everybody knows you do jiu jitsu, even though they also know you do other
[01:49:37] things. Other things, yeah, that are significant. I think that's why you and I look at you, I don't see
[01:49:42] okay, jiu jitsu guy, even though you're straight up, jiu jitsu guy. Yeah, I'm just going to say like
[01:49:46] I got, yeah, I'm not not a jiu jitsu, but then because you have all these other things that you
[01:49:51] have like straight up like for lack of a better term, significant prowess like in, you know,
[01:49:56] I don't know about all that. I don't have significant prowess in jiu jitsu, even though we're
[01:50:00] working on that one. What is prowess really? Like doing good at? Yeah, yeah, they're
[01:50:04] a great word. Well, I think that, yeah, good. I've totally missed these
[01:50:08] prowess anyway. I think that like the first time I've ever said that out loud, the word
[01:50:12] process and the last one. None of the left. That this would go kicking in, getting them brain cells
[01:50:16] working. Whether you want to be a jiu jitsu person or just have jiu jitsu be
[01:50:23] party your life. You should definitely make it party your life. You're going to need to get your
[01:50:28] community, rashguards, go to originmain.com and unfortunately for all of us, we can't just walk around
[01:50:33] in our geese. Unfortunately, so you got to get other clothing. You can also get that other clothing,

[01:50:54] made in America. You go to brass buttons, even the brass, the brass, what? But the brass buttons.
[01:51:01] Those are significant. Try look at them. They're like, they're legit. I mentioned the rivets.

[01:51:35] Anyway, also on the teach also on Jockel store. I know we're over COVID now, but when
[01:51:45] when I had COVID and then you had COVID, I was a little bit happy because I was like,

[01:51:55] the record. No factor. Yeah. It's true. A little bit happy. No no offense. Like, you know,
