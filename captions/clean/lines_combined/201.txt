00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.16 This is Jocopontcast number 201.
00:00:04.16 --> 00:00:07.28 With echo Charles and me, Jocca Willink.
00:00:07.28 --> 00:00:09.28 Good evening, I go good evening.
00:00:12.28 --> 00:00:15.68 I had left my daughter Maggie with my parents
00:00:15.68 --> 00:00:19.28 while I and my business partner drove a few minutes away
00:00:19.28 --> 00:00:22.56 to look at a vacant store right in the heart of town.
00:00:22.56 --> 00:00:26.56 As soon as I saw it, I knew it would be perfect.
00:00:26.56 --> 00:00:29.92 As the landlord was putting the lease in my hand from me to sign,
00:00:29.92 --> 00:00:31.68 myself on rang.
00:00:31.68 --> 00:00:33.68 And I saw it was my mom.
00:00:33.68 --> 00:00:37.68 Thinking she was just checking to see when I would be back,
00:00:37.68 --> 00:00:40.08 I ignored the call.
00:00:40.08 --> 00:00:43.68 When my phone immediately rang again,
00:00:43.68 --> 00:00:45.92 I knew something was up.
00:00:45.92 --> 00:00:50.64 My initial fear was that something happened to my 10-month-old daughter.
00:00:50.64 --> 00:00:54.24 My mind went to the worst place and at the time,
00:00:54.24 --> 00:00:56.32 I didn't think anything could be worse than that.
00:00:56.32 --> 00:00:59.12 When I answered the phone,
00:00:59.12 --> 00:01:03.12 all I heard on the other end were muffled screams.
00:01:04.40 --> 00:01:08.56 It was clearly a noise made by someone who was so broken up
00:01:08.56 --> 00:01:13.12 and in such a state of shock that he or she couldn't even cry properly.
00:01:16.16 --> 00:01:20.48 I didn't know how to prepare myself for whatever news I was about to receive,
00:01:20.48 --> 00:01:22.24 I started shaking uncontrollably.
00:01:23.28 --> 00:01:25.52 Tell me what happened, I cried.
00:01:25.52 --> 00:01:31.12 I was terrified that something horrible had happened to Maggie.
00:01:31.12 --> 00:01:34.08 Had she tripped and split open her head,
00:01:34.08 --> 00:01:37.28 choked on something, my mind was running wild with possibilities.
00:01:37.28 --> 00:01:41.60 Not knowing was almost worse than knowing at this point.
00:01:41.60 --> 00:01:44.56 Have you called an ambulance I yelled?
00:01:44.56 --> 00:01:47.84 Yes, answered the voice on the other phone.
00:01:47.84 --> 00:01:50.72 Before the line suddenly went dead.
00:01:50.72 --> 00:01:53.68 I knew that I was too upset to drive.
00:01:53.68 --> 00:01:55.68 I asked my business partner to take me home.
00:01:55.68 --> 00:01:58.72 A five-minute drive I had traveled countless times before,
00:01:58.72 --> 00:02:01.28 but this time those five minutes felt like an eternity.
00:02:03.28 --> 00:02:05.44 And while the car was crawling through the streets,
00:02:05.44 --> 00:02:07.68 my mind was racing at 1,000 miles a minute.
00:02:07.68 --> 00:02:09.84 My husband wasn't work about an hour away.
00:02:10.56 --> 00:02:13.52 While I wanted the comfort that his voice would bring,
00:02:13.52 --> 00:02:17.12 I decided not to call him until I got home to the house
00:02:17.12 --> 00:02:18.72 and could figure out what was going on.
00:02:20.24 --> 00:02:22.32 I didn't want to upset him if I didn't have to.
00:02:22.32 --> 00:02:24.000 As we pulled onto my parent's street,
00:02:24.96 --> 00:02:27.28 my heart started racing as fast as my mind.
00:02:28.80 --> 00:02:30.72 I didn't see an ambulance anywhere inside.
00:02:31.28 --> 00:02:33.36 For a moment that gave me a sense of relief.
00:02:33.36 --> 00:02:36.16 Maybe things weren't as serious as I had led myself to believe.
00:02:38.64 --> 00:02:41.52 My dad was standing in the driveway next to a friend.
00:02:42.48 --> 00:02:44.56 Lieutenant Colonel Korky Gardner.
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.72 He and my father had served together in the Marine Corps.
00:02:48.72 --> 00:02:52.48 And he was a deer friend of the family.
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.48 He and his wife lived about 45 minutes away,
00:02:56.48 --> 00:02:59.20 so it struck me as odd to see him standing there.
00:02:59.92 --> 00:03:03.52 Especially since my parents had not mentioned he would be coming over.
00:03:06.40 --> 00:03:08.64 I jumped out of the car while it was still moving.
00:03:08.64 --> 00:03:10.32 Where's the ambulance I screamed?
00:03:10.32 --> 00:03:17.12 My dad stared back at me with a blank look.
00:03:20.08 --> 00:03:23.60 Then in a very measured tone, he said,
00:03:26.16 --> 00:03:27.20 Travis was killed.
00:03:30.96 --> 00:03:32.72 I heard those words loud and clear,
00:03:32.72 --> 00:03:34.16 but they didn't make any sense to me.
00:03:35.52 --> 00:03:38.32 It took me a few seconds to process what I was being told.
00:03:38.32 --> 00:03:41.44 Since the moment I hung up the phone,
00:03:41.44 --> 00:03:42.72 I'd known something was wrong,
00:03:42.72 --> 00:03:45.20 but this was far worse than anything I could have imagined.
00:03:46.80 --> 00:03:48.96 I thought my daughter was an imminent danger.
00:03:48.96 --> 00:03:51.12 And here I was being told that my brother was dead.
00:03:55.84 --> 00:03:57.12 He was 26 years old.
00:03:57.12 --> 00:04:07.20 And that right there is an excerpt from a book called The Knock at the Door.
00:04:09.44 --> 00:04:14.08 Three gold star families bonded by grief and purpose.
00:04:14.08 --> 00:04:17.44 And this book is written by Ryan Manion,
00:04:18.72 --> 00:04:20.72 who wrote that opening section,
00:04:20.72 --> 00:04:24.72 who is the sister of US Marine First Lieutenant Travis Manion,
00:04:24.72 --> 00:04:29.04 who is killed in Iraq, is also written by Amy Looney,
00:04:29.04 --> 00:04:33.28 Hefferman, the surviving spouse of Lieutenant Brendan Looney,
00:04:34.32 --> 00:04:36.16 a seal officer killed in Afghanistan,
00:04:37.36 --> 00:04:43.44 and the other author, the final author, is Heather Kelly,
00:04:43.44 --> 00:04:48.56 the surviving spouse of First Lieutenant Robert Kelly,
00:04:48.56 --> 00:04:57.60 a Marine Corps officer, also killed in Afghanistan, and you may recognize these names,
00:04:58.40 --> 00:05:01.28 because I've talked about all these names on this podcast.
00:05:04.16 --> 00:05:12.48 I read a speech on podcast, number 162 about two brave Marines, Jonathan Yale,
00:05:12.48 --> 00:05:16.000 and Jordan Herder, who held the line at an outpost
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.20 while being attacked by a vehicle born bomb,
00:05:20.56 --> 00:05:23.92 and these two brave Marines stood their ground and stopped the vehicle before
00:05:23.92 --> 00:05:30.88 and entered their outpost, and killed many more of their fellow Marines,
00:05:30.88 --> 00:05:34.72 but the bomb did detonate, and it killed both of them.
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.52 And that speech was made by a Marine Corps general, General Kelly.
00:05:41.52 --> 00:05:47.20 Then I mentioned, when I read that speech,
00:05:47.20 --> 00:05:50.16 that General Kelly's son was killed in action,
00:05:51.28 --> 00:05:55.68 and that was, that was First Lieutenant Robert Kelly,
00:05:56.96 --> 00:06:00.000 and then you may have heard me talk about Brendan Looney,
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000 a seal that I put through training,
00:06:03.92 --> 00:06:07.04 who was loved by his brothers and the teams,
00:06:07.04 --> 00:06:14.56 who was a few days from coming home after a tough deployment in Afghanistan,
00:06:15.44 --> 00:06:17.84 who volunteered to go on a turnover operation,
00:06:19.28 --> 00:06:24.72 and was killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan on September 21, 2010,
00:06:26.08 --> 00:06:31.44 and when I talked about him, I spoke a lot about his best friend,
00:06:32.48 --> 00:06:34.64 Travis Mending, and I talked about Travis Mending,
00:06:34.64 --> 00:06:37.04 as well when I had Brian Stan on the podcast.
00:06:38.24 --> 00:06:42.16 Well, Travis Mending was killed in action on April 29, 2007,
00:06:42.80 --> 00:06:47.36 and I went into detail around the relationship between Travis and Brendan,
00:06:50.16 --> 00:06:51.76 who are buried next to each other,
00:06:52.80 --> 00:06:59.44 that are only to national cemetery, when I had Travis's dad on the podcast number 72,
00:06:59.44 --> 00:07:04.40 and we discussed his book, which is called Brothers Forever.
00:07:07.52 --> 00:07:13.20 And this book that I'm reading from today, the knock at the door,
00:07:13.20 --> 00:07:17.28 this gives a different perspective,
00:07:19.52 --> 00:07:25.36 a perspective of pain and of anguish, but also of surviving
00:07:25.36 --> 00:07:30.32 in overcoming and of moving forward through the pain
00:07:32.16 --> 00:07:35.60 and to a place of pride and a place of purpose,
00:07:36.32 --> 00:07:42.32 and it is an honor to have one of the authors of this book with us here today,
00:07:43.84 --> 00:07:49.76 Ryan Mending, sister of Travis Mending, to share some of what she has learned.
00:07:49.76 --> 00:07:56.96 So, Ryan, thank you for coming out here, and thank you for coming on the podcast.
00:07:56.96 --> 00:08:01.76 Yeah, I'm really happy to be here, and happy to talk a little bit more about the book.
00:08:03.28 --> 00:08:05.20 This is a tough way to start off a book.
00:08:06.72 --> 00:08:06.96 Yeah.
00:08:06.96 --> 00:08:11.52 With, I mean, what's got to be the worst day of your life, I'm assuming,
00:08:12.40 --> 00:08:13.68 or at least write up there.
00:08:13.68 --> 00:08:20.32 100% the worst day of my life, and it's interesting to hear you reading it,
00:08:22.72 --> 00:08:26.000 you become a little dis sensitized when you're putting things on paper,
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.40 and when you talk about it a lot, but to hear you reading it,
00:08:30.40 --> 00:08:35.36 it definitely brought a motion, it's in the way that you read too,
00:08:35.36 --> 00:08:39.20 but it kind of brings you back to that place.
00:08:39.20 --> 00:08:45.44 Well, whenever I read something like this, not only am I thinking about
00:08:46.80 --> 00:08:52.16 what you went through, what your family went through, but I'm also thinking about how many times this
00:08:52.16 --> 00:09:00.32 happened to my friends, my friends, families, and the pain and anguish that this causes.
00:09:00.32 --> 00:09:11.60 And yeah, you titled the book The Knock of the Door, and for anyone that doesn't understand this,
00:09:11.60 --> 00:09:21.92 the military has a very well-defined protocol that they take when a service member is killed
00:09:21.92 --> 00:09:29.28 overseas, and it's a personal notification, which is actually a great thing compared to what
00:09:29.28 --> 00:09:33.68 they used to do, and I don't know if you've ever seen the, what are those little messages that
00:09:33.68 --> 00:09:38.96 they used to send? Yeah, like a telegram message, that's right, it was a telegram, they would send a telegram
00:09:38.96 --> 00:09:46.72 that said, you know, dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith, we're sorry to inform you that your son Barry Smith
00:09:46.72 --> 00:09:55.04 was killed in action around this day, in around this area. So at some point,
00:09:55.04 --> 00:10:01.44 someone smart realized that that was a horrible way to notify families, so they have a very strict
00:10:01.44 --> 00:10:08.56 protocol, and what the protocol consists of is uniformed personnel from the service branch that the
00:10:08.56 --> 00:10:15.68 service member was in, going to the home and knocking on the door in full dress uniform.
00:10:16.72 --> 00:10:22.80 And it's these days what's become challenging about it is it's a race against social media and
00:10:22.80 --> 00:10:29.92 it's a race against the news. So when you have, when you're overseas and one of your troops are killed,
00:10:29.92 --> 00:10:34.64 there's like immediate radio silence, you're not allowed to tell anyone, because it's all to prevent
00:10:34.64 --> 00:10:40.24 the family from finding out that this has happened on the news, and let's face it, even with this
00:10:40.24 --> 00:10:46.96 protocol, which is designed to try and support the family as much as possible. I mean, it's, it's still
00:10:46.96 --> 00:10:54.24 just an absolute, it's just an absolute nightmare, and it's the worst fear of any family. That has a
00:10:54.24 --> 00:11:01.68 service member on an active duty deployed, the worst nightmare for all of us.
00:11:03.52 --> 00:11:10.32 And I think you did a great job of capturing how that, how that impacts. Now, before we go further
00:11:10.32 --> 00:11:16.72 down this story, I want to give a little bit of background between you and Travis, and I
00:11:16.72 --> 00:11:23.20 think it's, it starts to tell the story of of your relationship with him. I'm going to the book here.
00:11:23.20 --> 00:11:28.56 Travis and I had been born only 15 months apart. So to say we were close, we'd be an understatement.
00:11:28.56 --> 00:11:32.48 The fact that ours was a military family also brought us closer than most siblings.
00:11:33.04 --> 00:11:38.40 Like many military families, we had to adjust new situations very quickly until I was 12 when my
00:11:38.40 --> 00:11:44.96 dad left active duty before that we had moved almost every two years. We knew that no matter where
00:11:44.96 --> 00:11:49.36 we moved next, no matter what school we ended up in or which sports teams we'd be on,
00:11:49.36 --> 00:11:57.60 be the new kids on. We always had each other to depend on. Travis had been my built-in best friend
00:11:57.60 --> 00:12:10.16 at every stage of my life. What about the sister brother dynamic? Did you, well, you were older,
00:12:10.16 --> 00:12:15.36 so were you kind of like the, I mean, I was the denominator. I was the older sibling. Yes, there
00:12:15.36 --> 00:12:20.56 is no doubt about that. It was funny. I was having a conversation with someone last night and they
00:12:20.56 --> 00:12:26.96 were asking me about my relationship with Travis and I said, you know, Travis really did look
00:12:26.96 --> 00:12:34.24 up to me and sometimes I didn't fair him well because I was a bit of the wild child and
00:12:34.24 --> 00:12:40.48 you know, I wasn't always listening to my parents and so I could kind of skew him in the wrong
00:12:40.48 --> 00:12:49.12 direction and you know, looking back on things, I look at who my brother was and he was very driven
00:12:50.24 --> 00:12:58.000 even at a young age. There was something different about him and you know, I talk about a little
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.44 bit in the book. Like I felt like at times like what happened to that piece of DNA for me because I didn't
00:13:03.44 --> 00:13:09.28 have that drive. I didn't have that commitment to to goals or anything of that sort. But, you know,
00:13:09.84 --> 00:13:17.84 along with that came this idea that in the way that he was, I admired him so much. It wasn't a
00:13:17.84 --> 00:13:23.68 a jealousy. I wasn't like, oh, you know, there's great Travis or, you know, I was so proud of him
00:13:23.68 --> 00:13:29.76 and I was so proud to have him as my brother. So that's pretty unique. Yeah, I mean, my, I remember
00:13:29.76 --> 00:13:35.04 in high school, my girlfriends and I, we follow him around the Philadelphia area to his wrestling
00:13:35.04 --> 00:13:39.60 matches and we were like his main cheering squad in the front row and I'm like, that's my brother,
00:13:39.60 --> 00:13:44.72 the all-american wrestler, you know, I was so proud of him and it was, it was really cool to
00:13:45.44 --> 00:13:51.68 grow up with someone that even he was younger than me but that I could look up to so much, you know,
00:13:51.68 --> 00:13:56.08 and I think at the end of the day he helped me from not going too far off the rails, you know?
00:13:58.08 --> 00:14:03.60 It's weird and you got three children. I have three children. So I have four children and it's weird
00:14:03.60 --> 00:14:07.84 how an always trying to explain to people that they're going to be different. Oh yeah. You know,
00:14:07.84 --> 00:14:13.20 they're going to be different and you just kind of have to brace yourself as a parent. Which it sounds
00:14:13.20 --> 00:14:19.20 like your parents and to brace themselves for you. Oh, my dad braised himself for many, many years, many,
00:14:19.20 --> 00:14:26.56 many years and you know, growing up, I mean, I, I was an athlete and, um,
00:14:26.56 --> 00:14:31.84 the rest board said you put. I played lacrosse through, you know, I played every sport,
00:14:31.84 --> 00:14:36.40 growing up soccer basketball, everything but I played lacrosse through high school and college.
00:14:37.20 --> 00:14:44.24 And my dad always said, you know, between you and Travis, like you were the born athlete,
00:14:44.24 --> 00:14:49.12 like you had athletic ability, it came naturally to you. Like Travis had to work hard every
00:14:49.12 --> 00:14:55.52 thing he did. Travis played on, um, I remember we moved to Pennsylvania. He played on a CIO football team.
00:14:55.52 --> 00:15:02.88 And he was a short little chubby kid and his nickname was pork chop. And, you know, and
00:15:04.08 --> 00:15:11.12 Travis had to work to become who we became. I glided right through, never worked at anything,
00:15:11.12 --> 00:15:15.68 still got some money to go to school for college and play lacrosse and I look back now and I'm like,
00:15:15.68 --> 00:15:22.64 God, if I don't even apply myself a little bit like and really try to work at something.
00:15:22.64 --> 00:15:27.44 So it's weird that's a, that's a trait, right? Like this work ethic thing. Yeah.
00:15:27.44 --> 00:15:32.16 It's a trait that some people have and some people don't, I don't know, but, uh,
00:15:33.36 --> 00:15:38.32 what's it, I heard a quote, I heard a quote from one of my Brazilian friends and he said,
00:15:38.32 --> 00:15:46.72 there's a, there's a saying in Brazil that there's a reason that God doesn't give wings to a snake
00:15:47.60 --> 00:15:52.16 because if he did, we'd all be screwed because the snakes could just fly around and kill you.
00:15:52.72 --> 00:15:58.40 So that's like what happens, right? You can have that awesome work ethic, but you maybe don't get
00:15:58.40 --> 00:16:04.96 the full athletic capability that is optimal or you can be this really gifted athlete, but, you know,
00:16:04.96 --> 00:16:12.32 you like to party. Yeah. That, that, that pretty much describes it. Yeah. And it's cool that you,
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.32 it's cool that you didn't have this jealousy thing going on, right? Well, I guess you were
00:16:18.32 --> 00:16:22.32 in a accomplished athlete as well. So I guess it really, really wouldn't be there. Yeah, it was that,
00:16:22.32 --> 00:16:28.08 but more than that, it was also like, hey, my parents were so focused on Travis that I could kind of
00:16:28.08 --> 00:16:33.28 slide by with a lot of things. You know, it was like, hey, you know, we're, we're taking Travis to
00:16:33.28 --> 00:16:38.72 Lehigh for the, the nationals for wrestling. I'm like, sweet, I'm going to have a rager at the
00:16:38.72 --> 00:16:43.20 house this weekend. So would you legitimately do that? I legitimately did that. When your parents were
00:16:43.20 --> 00:16:49.36 gone, you would have ragers. Yes, several times. And you, and, and did you ever get caught?
00:16:50.32 --> 00:16:55.44 So I'll tell you a story. It was my brother, senior year, he was going to wrestle at the national
00:16:55.44 --> 00:17:03.20 perhaps. It's, it's huge. I mean, it's the huge, is tournament he's going to wrestle in. And he goes up to,
00:17:03.92 --> 00:17:11.36 he goes up and we, my best friend and I, my mom took us out to breakfast. And she's like, I'm
00:17:11.36 --> 00:17:14.80 taking out to breakfast before they left. They were heading to Lehigh for the weekend.
00:17:15.76 --> 00:17:20.48 And my girlfriend, Kristen, I are sitting there and my mom says, doesn't say to me, she says,
00:17:20.48 --> 00:17:26.72 Kristen, look me in the eye. You are not having a party at my house this weekend. And Kristen said,
00:17:27.44 --> 00:17:32.24 I promise Mrs. Man, and we're not going to have a party. She said to this, this day, it's the,
00:17:32.24 --> 00:17:37.36 like, she's like, I lied to your mom's face. Yes, straight up. I mean, we had, we had the
00:17:37.36 --> 00:17:43.60 pegs being delivered, like, you know, within the hour after they were gone. And the party got a
00:17:43.60 --> 00:17:49.28 little out of control. We were, you know, we had all these upper classmen show up. It was, and I'm like,
00:17:49.28 --> 00:17:54.72 oh my gosh, you got, it got ahead of us. And so finally, we get everybody out. The house is trashed.
00:17:54.72 --> 00:17:59.04 And so, like, my core group of friends were cleaning up the house, we're trying to get everything
00:17:59.04 --> 00:18:05.92 taken care of. And I tell my mom, buddy, there must be 12 bags of trash. And I said, take this trash.
00:18:05.92 --> 00:18:10.48 You're on trash due to get it out of here, get it in a dumpster. So he leaves with the trash. And
00:18:10.48 --> 00:18:14.16 I'm feeling pretty proud. I'm like, I think, I think we can cover this up, you know?
00:18:14.16 --> 00:18:21.12 So my parents come home the next day. And, you know, my mom walks in and she's kind of like looking
00:18:21.12 --> 00:18:26.000 around, like, like, do you have people over here? No, I just pressed and I did this to get her.
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.44 And I'm looking at everything. And we kind of, I'm like, we got away with this. It's about two hours
00:18:31.44 --> 00:18:36.96 later, knock on the door. My mom goes in the answers the door. And there's a lady standing there
00:18:36.96 --> 00:18:43.12 with all 12 bags of trash at the front door. And she's like, these were thrown into the field behind
00:18:43.12 --> 00:18:48.56 my house. She went through the trash, found like, because we had taken out the trash with like mail in it,
00:18:48.56 --> 00:18:54.48 found our dress. And, uh, and I just remember looking at Travis and he just shook his head like
00:18:54.48 --> 00:19:01.28 your such an idiot. I've, uh, when I go away and you know, I got teenage kids now and even
00:19:01.28 --> 00:19:06.48 well, coverman calls now, but I used to go away for whatever with my wife or whatever and leave the
00:19:06.48 --> 00:19:11.60 kids at home. And I'm like, are you guys going to have a rager? Or what? I kind of encouraged them.
00:19:11.60 --> 00:19:16.16 And they were like, no, they're like that. None of our friends will come to our house. They like,
00:19:16.16 --> 00:19:21.12 don't want to come here because of you. Yeah, totally. And I'm like, oh, well, okay, I guess that's
00:19:21.12 --> 00:19:26.000 a positive thing. So that's awesome. You guys had a, had, it's awesome that you didn't have that
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:33.52 rivalry, which can, which can happen in, in, in a, in a sibling relationships. My kids don't
00:19:33.52 --> 00:19:37.76 really have it either. Now that I think about it, which is cool. What about, like, competition,
00:19:37.76 --> 00:19:42.64 like, even on a more friendly level? Like, did, did you ever feel like you're competing with
00:19:42.64 --> 00:19:46.32 him? Ping pong death matches or anything like that? I mean, listen, you know,
00:19:46.32 --> 00:19:53.76 this in life, I mean, yeah, I mean, growing up, I mean, as when we were young, like, I used to
00:19:54.96 --> 00:20:00.56 tease him endlessly. I mean, my aunt tells the story of her wedding, you know, and, and she said,
00:20:01.44 --> 00:20:06.80 all you did was make Travis cry by teasing him the entire day. We were like 10 and 11 years old. So
00:20:06.80 --> 00:20:10.32 we fought like siblings. But I think by the time we hit high school,
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.28 there really wasn't competition. Like, hey, would I, would we get out back and play basketball?
00:20:17.28 --> 00:20:22.32 And, you know, yeah, that's, that sort of stuff, like, friendly, but like, there was nothing,
00:20:23.92 --> 00:20:27.12 competitive in terms of how our relationship worked.
00:20:27.12 --> 00:20:31.28 Hmm, interesting. Awesome. All right, you, you dive into this a little bit more. I'm going to go to the
00:20:31.28 --> 00:20:35.76 book here on a wooden, wooden beam in our basement by the bench press on which you had
00:20:35.76 --> 00:20:39.68 punished himself nightly. Travis wrote his goals in permanent black marker.
00:20:41.12 --> 00:20:46.08 Here they are all American wrestler, first team all Catholic and lacrosse,
00:20:46.08 --> 00:20:52.40 maintained 3.9 GPA. My aspirations were far more modest,
00:20:53.04 --> 00:20:58.64 rarely recorded and let's be honest, not terribly admirable. While Travis's key performance
00:20:58.64 --> 00:21:02.56 indicators consisted of grade point averages and athletic milestones,
00:21:02.56 --> 00:21:08.96 mind were quantified by number of parties attended or classes skipped without getting caught.
00:21:09.68 --> 00:21:14.96 Travis had a work ethic uncommon amongst most 16 year olds and as his older sister,
00:21:14.96 --> 00:21:21.36 I found it fascinating and a little unnerving. I marveled at Travis's ability to set a goal one year
00:21:21.36 --> 00:21:26.80 out even two years out and then worked tirelessly to meet it. Occasionally, I questioned what
00:21:26.80 --> 00:21:32.08 genetic material was absent from my DNA that caused this quality to skip me, but I never lost
00:21:32.08 --> 00:21:37.44 sleep about it. Though I admired his self-discipline and focus, I'm pretty sure Travis
00:21:37.44 --> 00:21:42.72 envied my vibrant social life and lighthearted attitude towards responsibility.
00:21:42.72 --> 00:21:46.88 So you guys kind of balanced each other out? Totally. Did you, when you were looking at him
00:21:47.92 --> 00:21:51.92 with his goals and everything like that and you're saying, well, that skipped me. Did you ever
00:21:51.92 --> 00:21:56.08 say, well, it didn't skip me. I can make a goal and I can go for it. Did you ever, did you did
00:21:56.08 --> 00:22:01.20 that ever cross your mind or is that just not part of your brain? Yeah, I mean, I have to be honest,
00:22:01.20 --> 00:22:08.56 I just didn't really care. You know, I was, I was happy to take the back seat to his start-up.
00:22:09.44 --> 00:22:16.80 You played the crossing college. I mean, that's no joke. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I broke some school records
00:22:16.80 --> 00:22:22.16 at my playing college lacrosse and you know what? And so I don't want to take away anything from that,
00:22:22.16 --> 00:22:30.08 but it was like, I went to a D3 school, I played lacrosse. I was the leading score on the team
00:22:30.08 --> 00:22:35.12 and it was a lot of fun and you know, and Travis would come to my games. I remember Travis came to
00:22:35.12 --> 00:22:42.40 one of my games and him and my uncle Chris were like heckling the goalie because the goalie had like
00:22:42.40 --> 00:22:46.96 had a cheap shot at me. I played a tack. I was right up front and so they're like standing behind
00:22:46.96 --> 00:22:53.20 heckling the goalie and after the game, you know, we win the game and we're standing there and the coach
00:22:53.20 --> 00:23:00.48 says the coach is like, doesn't directly say anything to me, but she goes, I'm just going to say this
00:23:00.48 --> 00:23:07.36 right now. If I see anybody's family messing with, you know, messing with another team again,
00:23:07.36 --> 00:23:12.96 that's so called player will not be playing on my team anymore. And so I like leaving on my
00:23:12.96 --> 00:23:17.92 thanks a lot guys. You know, you come to one game and you know, I'm about to kick off the team
00:23:17.92 --> 00:23:22.16 for what you're doing. What the hell are they doing? I mean, you've got to make a pretty
00:23:22.16 --> 00:23:28.56 significant impact on the game. Yeah, I mean, there was it was a it was a cheap shot my her
00:23:28.56 --> 00:23:35.36 and what, you know, I shot, she came out and whacked me so hard and an intentional way, you know,
00:23:35.36 --> 00:23:42.000 and that was my brother. Like he was if someone messed with me, like go mess with me. Yeah,
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.80 I mean, if someone messes with you, he's going to hackle them. Yeah, but majorly, yeah, if you're
00:23:46.80 --> 00:23:51.52 growing, you're going to get happy with if you're a guy. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So you tell a good story and here,
00:23:51.52 --> 00:23:59.60 it's like a Saturday night and there's a party going on and I you have this ideal situation,
00:23:59.60 --> 00:24:03.84 because you got your brother who's kind of a straight and narrow kind of guy. So that means you have
00:24:03.84 --> 00:24:11.52 a designated driver. You invite him to go to this party. The party, you know, it goes gets kind of
00:24:11.52 --> 00:24:17.60 wild and then the cops show up. And so here we go to the book teenagers scattered Travis Krista,
00:24:17.60 --> 00:24:21.44 who's one of the people you're with and I quickly found one another and joined the mad rush
00:24:21.44 --> 00:24:24.88 toward the back of the house. We barreled through the kitchen door, hopped the fence that's
00:24:24.88 --> 00:24:29.12 surrounded the property and sprinted for the woods behind the house. Those woods were our ticket to
00:24:29.12 --> 00:24:34.88 freedom. They also represented a blessed escape from the terrifying wrath of my parents,
00:24:34.88 --> 00:24:40.80 who almost certainly would have disowned me for what would have been my third underage drinking
00:24:40.80 --> 00:24:47.68 citation in my high school career. So you had some milestones you were making. So you're running
00:24:47.68 --> 00:24:52.88 in through the woods. There's a footbridge and somehow you fall off the footbridge, which actually
00:24:52.88 --> 00:24:56.96 the word you're using here, you say I got thrown off the footbridge. Was that even me? Well,
00:24:56.96 --> 00:25:01.84 because there's a hundred kids running over a bridge that's this wide. I'll try and hit that
00:25:01.84 --> 00:25:08.64 same cornfield. So yes, someone pushed off because you're getting to the cornfield and then
00:25:08.64 --> 00:25:12.08 you're good. Yeah. Because they cannot find you in a cornfield. They're not run. The
00:25:12.08 --> 00:25:18.40 concert not chasing us into a cornfield. Cornfields are crazy. Yeah. Like you can get lost in cornfields.
00:25:18.40 --> 00:25:23.52 I have many times. Yeah. All right. So you end up you end up getting thrown from this footbridge
00:25:24.24 --> 00:25:29.60 and you go back to the book. I became aware of a pain coursing through my leg. I looked
00:25:29.60 --> 00:25:34.48 down and saw that my shin was covered in blood. My khaki pens were red. So now,
00:25:34.48 --> 00:25:39.04 Travis is like, hey, we got to get you some help and you guys discussed that a little bit. Finally,
00:25:39.04 --> 00:25:45.92 you are going to walk back to the car and finally the car was with insight. But just as we
00:25:45.92 --> 00:25:52.64 rounded a giant pine tree, a blinding light shown in our eyes busted. Hey kids, get over here.
00:25:53.04 --> 00:25:58.56 A square jawed officer examined us with his flashlight. He wanted names, ages, and a full
00:25:58.56 --> 00:26:03.52 account of our whereabouts that evening. Somewhere in the interrogation session, a light bulb
00:26:03.52 --> 00:26:09.44 seemed to go off in his head. His eyes softened and his lips turned up into a smile. Hey, wait.
00:26:10.24 --> 00:26:17.28 You're Travis, man. Yes, sir. Hello, the wrestling season you've had, kid. Thank you, sir. And so then
00:26:17.28 --> 00:26:23.76 he, you know, Travis kind of plays this thing up to get you guys to get you guys out of
00:26:24.80 --> 00:26:28.88 out of trouble. Yeah. So this is the kind of, this is the kind of thing that you two had going on.
00:26:28.88 --> 00:26:37.68 Yeah, it was, uh, did, uh, did you, since you guys are close in age, did your friends all hang
00:26:37.68 --> 00:26:42.16 out together? Oh, yeah, totally. I mean, my friends were his friends. Did you go out with any of your
00:26:42.16 --> 00:26:46.56 friends? Um, he hung out with some of my friends. Did you go out with any of his friends?
00:26:47.84 --> 00:26:53.12 Little bit. Yeah, no serious relationship. My kids are like, my oldest three kids are
00:26:53.12 --> 00:26:59.68 about 18 to 24 months apart. Yeah. And it's 18 for the first two. And so there's always,
00:26:59.68 --> 00:27:04.56 but the oldest two are girls. And then there's the boy. Yeah. But the weird thing is the boy's like
00:27:04.56 --> 00:27:09.84 six three. And he's always been taller than them since. So I don't know. It's, but there's,
00:27:09.84 --> 00:27:14.96 there's like a little in, there's like a little line with my kids. The friends all hang around,
00:27:14.96 --> 00:27:20.32 but there's never been like a relationship anywhere. Yeah, no. I mean, I'll tell you like in,
00:27:20.32 --> 00:27:27.28 and I think it was my, was my senior year, my senior year. You know, we had, I had one friend who
00:27:28.80 --> 00:27:33.52 didn't get asked to prom. And you know, it was a sad thing, you know, and she's like,
00:27:33.52 --> 00:27:38.56 heartbroken about it. And I'm like Travis, you're, you're taking her to prom. And he's like,
00:27:38.56 --> 00:27:42.24 I know this girl, I'm like, you're taking her prom. He's like, fine. You know, like he always
00:27:42.24 --> 00:27:49.60 just kind of like stepped in. I mean, certainly, a lot of my friends were, um, and that
00:27:49.60 --> 00:27:56.88 I'm never by Travis. I'll put that way. Travis, was this stud? Yeah. All right. So you guys have this awesome
00:27:56.88 --> 00:28:08.88 relationship. And I'm going to go back now to the day you find out. So here we go. I couldn't believe it.
00:28:08.88 --> 00:28:14.48 I didn't want to believe it. I collapsed in a heap right there on the driveway. I remember thinking
00:28:14.48 --> 00:28:20.80 that the asphalt felt a naturally warm for a mid April afternoon that had been mild. It's not fair.
00:28:20.80 --> 00:28:25.52 It's not fair. I screamed over and over into the sky. I wanted to make sure that everyone,
00:28:25.52 --> 00:28:32.000 even got himself knew that he had made a terrible mistake. As I screamed, my parents' neighbors
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.52 spilled out of their houses to find out what was happening. My dad didn't rush to my side to comfort
00:28:37.52 --> 00:28:44.000 me. He let me get those tortured screams out of my system before I went about the hard work
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.28 I'm trying to understand what had happened and pick up the pieces. As it always been the case with
00:28:49.28 --> 00:28:54.72 my dad, he knew exactly what I needed before I did. I have no idea how long I lay on the ground
00:28:54.72 --> 00:29:01.84 screaming. I just know that it was long enough to get the rage out of my system. That's some
00:29:01.84 --> 00:29:07.52 point. One of the neighbors helped me up and walked me down the driveway toward my house. As I walked,
00:29:07.52 --> 00:29:13.36 I turned around and saw an unfamiliar car parked out in front of the house. In my shock,
00:29:13.36 --> 00:29:18.96 I hadn't even noticed it earlier. Inside, sat a young man about my age and full military dress
00:29:18.96 --> 00:29:25.52 blues. His forehead was resting on the top of the steering wheel, pressed between two folded arms
00:29:25.52 --> 00:29:31.44 that cradled his head. His eyes were closed and he looked ejected or perhaps unconscious.
00:29:33.36 --> 00:29:39.20 I later learned this parmarine 26 years old had been charged with the unfortunate task of
00:29:39.20 --> 00:29:44.88 sharing the news with the people closest to Travis that he had been killed in Iraq. Captain
00:29:44.88 --> 00:29:50.32 Eric Kael, as I later learned his name was, had been assigned to carry out the jobs since he was
00:29:50.32 --> 00:29:54.80 local and it graduated from the Naval Academy the year before my brother. Lieutenant Colonel
00:29:54.80 --> 00:30:00.000 Gardner had also been called since the military knew that he was a family friend close by.
00:30:00.80 --> 00:30:06.16 Together while I had been out scouting sites for my boutique, they had approached my parents'
00:30:06.16 --> 00:30:12.16 door and knocked. My mother opened the door, took one look at quirky in the young marine uniform
00:30:13.04 --> 00:30:18.96 and slammed the door in their faces. She simply couldn't face what was on the other side.
00:30:26.32 --> 00:30:32.08 Like I said, that's what every military family knows there's only one reason that that
00:30:32.08 --> 00:30:38.48 person's coming in your house and their dress uniforms. And since your dad was in the Marine
00:30:38.48 --> 00:30:45.44 Corps for whatever 20 something years and she obviously was new. This is good as well as anyone.
00:30:50.40 --> 00:30:56.48 So she wasn't sure she could face what was on the other side. I wasn't sure I could either.
00:30:57.28 --> 00:31:01.20 When I reached the front door with the help of my neighbor, I stopped. I had walked through the
00:31:01.20 --> 00:31:06.96 that door thousands of times before but this time I wanted to turn the other direction and run away.
00:31:06.96 --> 00:31:12.40 I knew deep down in my soul that once I passed through that door this time,
00:31:12.40 --> 00:31:38.16 the life that I had known was over and there was no going back. That permanence, I was
00:31:38.16 --> 00:31:47.68 at the seal teams. I was in the training command and a guy got wounded really bad overseas
00:31:48.88 --> 00:31:55.20 and somebody called me and said, hey, this guy, he got wounded really bad. And I think
00:31:55.76 --> 00:32:00.32 the guys that called the guy, there's two guys on the other end and I think
00:32:00.32 --> 00:32:16.88 they were looking for like a little bit of sympathy. One of the guys got wounded really bad
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.64 and I remember saying, because I had heard the initial report that a guy was going to really
00:32:22.64 --> 00:32:32.64 about really bad and then these guys this call came probably 36 hours later and I said,
00:32:32.64 --> 00:32:41.92 hey, is he stable? And they said, yeah, he's stable and I said, well then we're good.
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:51.44 And for them, I mean, for them they were still thinking like, hey, this guy's going to lose limbs,
00:32:51.44 --> 00:32:59.12 like this guy's going to be in really bad shape. But for me, like because you know, I only come
00:32:59.12 --> 00:33:06.000 back from Iraq a little while before and lost guys there. Yeah. And so for me, the difference between
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.88 hey, this guy's as messed up as this guy's going to be is horrible. The situation is and the wounds
00:33:12.88 --> 00:33:22.000 that he suffered are horrible, but he's going to be here and this permanence of what you, you know,
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.24 that's what, that's what I was thinking about when I was reading about you saying, when you walk through
00:33:26.24 --> 00:33:31.52 that door, the line between life and death is like, it's like you can't even, you can't even
00:33:31.52 --> 00:33:42.000 identify it so, so slender and it falls on one side or the other. Yeah, you know, I've, I, you know,
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.08 you go through that initial phase of shock, but I remember thinking like, why couldn't he just
00:33:48.08 --> 00:33:53.92 been like, why couldn't we be flying a Germany right now, you know? And I've even had dreams about
00:33:53.92 --> 00:34:00.48 like Travis being there, but he's like super wounded, you know, he's missing both his legs,
00:34:00.48 --> 00:34:07.60 but I'm like, who cares? It's Travis, you know, I, I, of course you take him in any form
00:34:07.60 --> 00:34:14.80 if they're alive, you know, and it's just that idea and I think for me, you know, when my mom
00:34:14.80 --> 00:34:21.76 opened the door, it's, I don't, I don't write about it in the book, but like it was a super volatile
00:34:21.76 --> 00:34:30.80 time when he was there. And my mom had gotten an email a week before from the Major's wife on the
00:34:30.80 --> 00:34:36.72 mid team and she had, you know, said, I can't speak to it now because she was kind of the liaison
00:34:36.72 --> 00:34:42.32 to all the families. I can't speak to it now, but I just want you to know that something happened last
00:34:42.32 --> 00:34:51.28 week that was very significant and your, you know, your husband's and sons what they did is,
00:34:51.28 --> 00:34:59.92 you know, was incredible. And, you know, all of all of mother thinks is, well, you know, bad
00:34:59.92 --> 00:35:08.96 stuff is going down. And so she leading up to that knock, she was on edge. She was on edge that
00:35:08.96 --> 00:35:17.04 entire deployment, but even more so after that email came and, you know, I think that is,
00:35:17.04 --> 00:35:21.60 she tried to every morning when she woke up, she sent a mini mail, he didn't email back, but she
00:35:21.60 --> 00:35:28.48 sent a mini mail every day, she was sending another care package that probably wasn't getting to
00:35:28.48 --> 00:35:33.68 him who's getting to, you know, Faluja, but where he was, he wasn't having care packages
00:35:33.68 --> 00:35:38.08 dropped into store, but it was like those were the things she had to do to like process while
00:35:38.08 --> 00:35:43.20 he was there. Like this is what's going to get me through. And that Sunday, I think there,
00:35:43.20 --> 00:35:47.28 there's something about the fact that, you know, she woke up that morning and just said,
00:35:47.28 --> 00:35:53.44 I want to have people over. Like it was, there was no plan around it. And she was a planner.
00:35:53.44 --> 00:36:00.24 So, but that morning, she woke up and said, Tom, let's have people over. So, you imagine all these
00:36:00.24 --> 00:36:05.92 different scenarios, all these different knocks that people get. And, you know, you see mine,
00:36:05.92 --> 00:36:12.56 you're going to see Heather's and Amy's in the book as well. But, imagine a scenario where
00:36:13.44 --> 00:36:18.72 the mother and father are opening the door and there's 30 people in the house, you know,
00:36:18.72 --> 00:36:27.04 there to have a family barbecue. And I remember when I walked in that door, I could see smoke coming
00:36:27.04 --> 00:36:33.20 off the grill because my dad had walked to enter the door and left all the meat on the grill.
00:36:33.20 --> 00:36:42.000 And it's out there like on fire. And it was like, it was pure pandemonium. Like, my people,
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.000 nobody knows what to do. And people are just literally running around a house like screaming
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.32 all the women are just screaming. Like, there is no sanity in this room. And I think that's why
00:36:52.32 --> 00:36:57.04 my dad's just like, I'm going to stand out in this driveway, you know, with Colonel Gardner,
00:36:57.04 --> 00:37:01.44 because he's just like, and then the rest is like, all these women and people are coming up like,
00:37:01.44 --> 00:37:06.48 what do you need? I'm like, what do I like? What kind of question is that? I don't know. I don't even
00:37:06.48 --> 00:37:17.20 know what, what is upright now, you know? But that chaotic scene is something that plays out a lot
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.64 in my mind over and over, you know? Well, time of day, was it? It was like one o'clock in the afternoon,
00:37:24.64 --> 00:37:31.60 you know, it was like, come up for a Sunday barbecue and, you know, ants and uncles are there.
00:37:31.60 --> 00:37:37.76 My dad's siblings, you know, some of my dad's siblings, all my mom's siblings, my grandmother.
00:37:37.76 --> 00:37:43.20 It was my cousins, you know? It was just that. And my mom was always like, kind of the person,
00:37:43.20 --> 00:37:49.76 like, coming to my home, you know, let's do something. But just to have those people there,
00:37:49.76 --> 00:37:57.92 when that moment took place, I remember turning, as I turned to walk in the door, I turned and it
00:37:57.92 --> 00:38:06.24 was my little cousins. And it's my dad's sister, my aunt Susan, she was standing there with my
00:38:06.24 --> 00:38:12.48 gods on and her two other kids and they were standing on like the step going to the back of the
00:38:12.48 --> 00:38:17.92 house and she's just trying to console these little kids who grew up with Travis. I mean,
00:38:17.92 --> 00:38:25.20 literally grew up with him and she's just trying, and I'm just like, you can't even,
00:38:25.20 --> 00:38:32.16 you can't even play that scene out in a movie, you know? I mean, you can't even capture what what it was.
00:38:37.12 --> 00:38:45.20 You, um, you, you talk about that scene and then, and then you say this in all the chaos and
00:38:45.20 --> 00:38:50.24 furious movement, I locked eyes with my grandmother who's seated alone in a wheelchair in the dining room,
00:38:50.24 --> 00:38:55.84 tears streaming down her cheeks. She was receiving neither comfort nor attention from anyone.
00:38:55.84 --> 00:39:02.24 My heart broke in that instant. I'll never forget that image. The rest of the day is a blur.
00:39:02.24 --> 00:39:11.84 I floated between feelings of painful shock and dark emptiness. When I woke the next morning,
00:39:11.84 --> 00:39:17.04 I remembered what it felt like coming out of anesthesia from an operation I'd had in college.
00:39:17.04 --> 00:39:22.64 First one, I lit open cautiously, then the next, but my body remained frozen. My mind was already
00:39:22.64 --> 00:39:28.32 turning going over the details of the previous day and coming to terms with the unalterable fact
00:39:28.32 --> 00:39:35.28 that my best friend and brother was dead. This marked the first of what turned out to be many
00:39:35.28 --> 00:39:40.88 anxiety-ridden mornings that would follow. Every day I would slowly and rarely transition from
00:39:40.88 --> 00:39:47.52 sleep to consciousness, hoping that my overwhelming anxiety wouldn't make another appearance, but it
00:39:47.52 --> 00:39:59.60 always did. Did you ever have the um, did you ever wake up in the morning and forget for like
00:39:59.60 --> 00:40:08.64 three seconds? What had happened? No, um, I didn't. It was actually more like a soon,
00:40:10.96 --> 00:40:18.96 as soon as I opened my eyes, tears, I would be crying. Like if I was awake, I was either like
00:40:20.96 --> 00:40:28.96 non-functional or I was crying. And I would say for a good month, I woke up and I'm like,
00:40:28.96 --> 00:40:34.24 oh my gosh, I think so every day for the rest of my life, I'm going to wake up crying. You're
00:40:34.24 --> 00:40:38.40 like, you go through these things. Like, okay, this is the new normal I will wake up crying every
00:40:38.40 --> 00:40:44.64 day. And I honestly could not wait every night to fall asleep because the only time I wasn't
00:40:45.68 --> 00:40:54.32 in pain was when I was sleeping. So it was just like how quickly he came my body and in those moments,
00:40:54.32 --> 00:41:00.40 it's not easy to sleep, right? So sleep didn't come very easily. So I was so thankful when my body
00:41:00.40 --> 00:41:06.72 would let me sleep. And you know, that was the only time I was necessarily forgetting.
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.88 I've experienced like when something really bad happens, like when I've lost friends and
00:41:13.68 --> 00:41:19.76 I wake up in the morning and for like three, literally three seconds, you know, the alarm clock
00:41:19.76 --> 00:41:25.60 goes off and I, you know, shut off the alarm clock and I, and everything's like totally normal
00:41:26.56 --> 00:41:32.16 for like for three seconds. And then I take two steps out of my bed and boom, I get hit.
00:41:39.52 --> 00:41:49.44 Now you all go to meet Travis as he is flown home and we're going to the book, the
00:41:49.44 --> 00:41:55.68 greeting at Dover was gut wrenching. My parents and I were plagued by questions in those early days
00:41:55.68 --> 00:42:00.64 that were difficult to ignore who his Travis with when he died, what happened? Was it instant?
00:42:00.64 --> 00:42:05.36 Slowly the answers started to unfold. We learned that Travis wasn't actually scheduled to be
00:42:05.36 --> 00:42:10.16 out on the mission the day that he was killed. Instead of fellow marine was slated for the patrol,
00:42:10.16 --> 00:42:15.04 but he wasn't feeling up to a Travis who had been assigned to do some humanitarian work at a
00:42:15.04 --> 00:42:19.84 local Iraqi school offered to take his place. During the course of the patrol, Travis and his
00:42:19.84 --> 00:42:25.20 team of Marines were ambushed, a firefighter erupted and they were quickly pinned down,
00:42:25.20 --> 00:42:30.16 taking fire from three sides, Travis seeing his Navy corpsman shot and line wounded in the middle
00:42:30.16 --> 00:42:34.000 of the road immediately ran out of the line of fire to carry his colleague to safety.
00:42:34.72 --> 00:42:39.20 As the ambush intensified, Travis again entered the line of fire to pull another wounded
00:42:39.20 --> 00:42:44.24 marine back to safety in a covered position. Then Travis moved out to take on the ambush
00:42:44.24 --> 00:42:50.24 that was now overwhelming his patrol undontered by the onslaught he fired his M203 grenade launcher,
00:42:50.24 --> 00:42:55.84 taking out an enemy position and then expended a firestorm of rounds at the other positions
00:42:55.84 --> 00:43:01.52 before running out of ammunition. His efforts pushed the enemy back and changed the entire momentum
00:43:01.52 --> 00:43:11.36 of the ambush, ultimately saving the lives of his entire patrol. It was then that Travis was shot by a sniper
00:43:11.36 --> 00:43:16.96 and immediately the enemy began to pull back. His teammates quickly grabbed them and provided
00:43:16.96 --> 00:43:23.36 what emergency medical care they could. He was rushed back to Camp Felusia where he was pronounced
00:43:23.36 --> 00:43:27.84 dead by the medical staff that had worked feverishly to try and save him.
00:43:31.92 --> 00:43:35.52 There's no part of that story that doesn't sound just like my brother.
00:43:35.52 --> 00:43:42.08 Offering to take the worst assignment to help a friend and need, that was Travis.
00:43:43.28 --> 00:43:48.40 Thinking about the safety of others before ever considering his own, that was Travis too.
00:43:48.40 --> 00:43:53.12 Seeing the dismal odds that didn't bode well for him and choosing to grid his teeth and answer
00:43:53.12 --> 00:44:02.000 a fire with more fire anyway, also Travis. My brother was a protector and a warrior in every sense
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:09.04 of those terms. I certainly felt it as a sister and I'm proud to know that his fellow marines
00:44:09.04 --> 00:44:16.80 got to experience it too. When I learned that he'd been killed by a bullet, I was never said
00:44:16.80 --> 00:44:21.20 wouldn't be able to stomach the sight of him in an open casket. My mind imagined the worst.
00:44:24.16 --> 00:44:28.72 I was shocked then when the lid of the casket was raised at the viewing to see my brother looking
00:44:28.72 --> 00:44:36.64 as though he were sleeping peacefully. Just as I'd remembered him, I approached the coffin
00:44:37.84 --> 00:44:44.80 and rubbed his head as I'd done a hundred times before. From the time he was a child,
00:44:44.80 --> 00:44:50.40 Travis had always supported a buzz cut and as I felt the surface of his freshly cut hair with
00:44:50.40 --> 00:44:59.20 my fingertips, I thought, yep, that's Travis's head.
00:45:14.96 --> 00:45:18.56 That was Travis.
00:45:18.56 --> 00:45:34.72 It's like his whole life was leading to this moment where he needed to do something beyond
00:45:34.72 --> 00:45:41.52 what is expected of a human being to do. When you look back
00:45:41.52 --> 00:45:51.60 at his childhood, I think he was doing things that were beyond what a ten-year-old child
00:45:52.48 --> 00:45:57.68 was supposed to do or what a 15-year-old kid was supposed to do. It was like,
00:45:57.68 --> 00:46:03.60 and they were small moments in the whole scheme of things, but they ultimately
00:46:03.60 --> 00:46:10.88 prepared him for that last day.
00:46:10.88 --> 00:46:17.52 I was after Mikey Montstorre, got killed and we came home and I was talking to Mikey's sister.
00:46:19.52 --> 00:46:24.24 She was just, she just said, yeah, she said when I found out what happened, I wasn't even remotely
00:46:24.24 --> 00:46:30.40 surprised at all. She's like, oh, he jumped on a grenade and saved three of his friends. She's like,
00:46:30.40 --> 00:46:37.92 that's exactly, she's like, I don't want to say that I knew that this would happen, but she said,
00:46:38.64 --> 00:46:40.48 this is no surprise at all. Yeah.
00:46:47.52 --> 00:46:51.84 Going back to the book, I stood by a side all day greeting friends and family who had taken
00:46:51.84 --> 00:46:56.64 the time to pay the respects. One of Travis's best friends and roommate at the Naval Academy
00:46:56.64 --> 00:47:02.64 Brendan Looney was unable to make the funeral. He was in San Diego attending the basic underwater
00:47:02.64 --> 00:47:08.48 demolition seal school, the training program required for Navy seals, leaving to attend the
00:47:08.48 --> 00:47:12.88 services on the East Coast would have surely meant relinquishing his chance to become a seal officer.
00:47:13.76 --> 00:47:19.28 But Brendan's girlfriend at the time Amy, who had also been close to Travis, did come to say
00:47:19.28 --> 00:47:29.36 her final goodbye. I remember Amy walking up to the casket, investing into tears. I knew the loss
00:47:29.36 --> 00:47:36.72 cut her deeply as well. It was a physically and mentally exhausting day and as much as I could
00:47:36.72 --> 00:47:41.76 hardly bear the idea of standing by that casket one minute longer after hours of doing so. I also
00:47:41.76 --> 00:47:49.76 didn't want to imagine that time coming to an end. I knew that after the last person knelt down to
00:47:49.76 --> 00:47:54.96 say a prayer in front of Travis, the funeral director was going to close that casket forever
00:47:54.96 --> 00:48:05.44 and that would be it. I'd never seen my brother's face again. I rubbed his head one last time
00:48:05.44 --> 00:48:11.44 and felt my heart sinking as my father gently pulled me away.
00:48:23.84 --> 00:48:29.60 After the funeral, the burial and the celebration of his life that followed I remember sitting
00:48:29.60 --> 00:48:33.36 on the back stairs outside my parents home to the same place where I'd saw it sawless and the
00:48:33.36 --> 00:48:40.40 chaos after first hearing of his death, the winter had melted away. In a beautiful spring day
00:48:40.40 --> 00:48:44.48 had sprung up in its place in the weeks and months that followed I often found myself outside
00:48:44.48 --> 00:48:53.04 crouched on that stair and that in those stairs in that same position. Time was passing. Life was
00:48:53.04 --> 00:49:01.28 moving on. I was watching it happen but I was not participating in it. I felt bitterness towards
00:49:01.28 --> 00:49:07.84 the people who could return to their normal lives, jobs and families while I sat on the same stair
00:49:07.84 --> 00:49:11.52 in the same red sweatshirt terrified of what might come next.
00:49:20.64 --> 00:49:27.52 I, you know when you were talking about like saying, oh this is just the way it's going to be
00:49:27.52 --> 00:49:34.88 from now on. I'm just going to be crying all the time and I had somebody asked me about you know
00:49:34.88 --> 00:49:44.24 when is this end? How do you get through this? The way I tried to explain it is by saying
00:49:45.44 --> 00:49:49.92 when you first experience something devastating like this you're going to get hit with these waves
00:49:49.92 --> 00:49:57.60 and the waves are going to be really powerful, really strong and they're going to come really
00:49:57.60 --> 00:50:06.48 often. And what's scary about them is by the time you're 28 years old or 20 years old or whatever
00:50:06.48 --> 00:50:11.20 however old you are you've learned to control your emotions and all of a sudden you're in a situation
00:50:11.20 --> 00:50:17.60 where you don't have control anymore. And it seems like like you said that's just the way it's going
00:50:17.60 --> 00:50:27.20 to be from now on. And then what I've noticed is over time those waves they start to lose some strength.
00:50:27.20 --> 00:50:33.68 They're just not as strong as they were and over time those waves they separate and they get
00:50:33.68 --> 00:50:38.16 further and further apart. And what happens is this is what I thought of when I read this
00:50:38.16 --> 00:50:46.08 this part that you wrote is you know the closer you are to the person the stronger those waves are
00:50:46.08 --> 00:50:53.92 and the longer it takes for that calm to approach. So when you see other people that are already kind
00:50:53.92 --> 00:51:00.32 of have found some calm again and they're moving on it makes you it can make you mad.
00:51:00.32 --> 00:51:08.96 Totally. I you know they have that the 12 stages of grief I couldn't name all 12 stages and
00:51:08.96 --> 00:51:15.60 and followed but like I know anger's up there and I felt anger you know and it was just like
00:51:15.60 --> 00:51:24.40 and it was anger at everyone else like screw you guys you know we're we're we're just we're here
00:51:24.40 --> 00:51:30.80 we're living it and you're living their lives on the flipside you know having some perspective like
00:51:32.24 --> 00:51:37.28 thank you for being there for us thank you for doing what you did thank you for
00:51:37.28 --> 00:51:43.20 leaving your job for a week to support my family you know you don't have that mindset when
00:51:43.20 --> 00:51:47.36 you're in it you're like oh you're going back to work you're you're flying back like what do you
00:51:47.36 --> 00:51:54.000 mean like no you're all supposed to be here and you know we're all going to live together in this house
00:51:54.64 --> 00:52:00.56 and and support each other yeah you you think yourself life is not going to go on the way was ever
00:52:00.56 --> 00:52:06.96 yeah and and that was the that was the scariest part so was this this idea of like it was that
00:52:06.96 --> 00:52:13.52 initial walk through the door and then then everything takes over you know you go into this auto pilot
00:52:13.52 --> 00:52:20.32 of like we've got to plan for everything so it's the anticipation of being it dover but that
00:52:20.32 --> 00:52:31.60 anticipation comes with a level of excitement isn't the right word but like I can't wait till
00:52:31.60 --> 00:52:36.000 that call from comes on the plate off the plane there he is he's now with us you know and
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:42.64 it's the small steps and it's like okay next is the viewing I can't wait to be able to see my
00:52:42.64 --> 00:52:48.08 brother and then it's like we're closing that casket and it's like another thing you know you walk
00:52:48.08 --> 00:52:54.48 through that door the casket's closing the funeral mass happens everyone comes back you've got
00:52:54.48 --> 00:53:01.52 hundreds and hundreds of people at a reception and then it's like that last bag of trash is taken
00:53:01.52 --> 00:53:08.08 out by the neighbor and they say bye and you're like oh crap now we actually really have to think
00:53:08.08 --> 00:53:21.44 about what this means you know because you're just kind of going through this process by the way I failed
00:53:21.44 --> 00:53:26.72 to mention this so far I'm not reading the whole book and so if there's some things that are jumping
00:53:26.72 --> 00:53:33.68 around or whatever that's why because I'm not here to do an audio version of this book but that's
00:53:33.68 --> 00:53:39.52 why I'm reading chunks of it but you've got all kinds of detail in there that I'm not going over
00:53:39.52 --> 00:53:44.88 and connecting these chunks that I'm reading so that's why people should just buy the books I haven't
00:53:44.88 --> 00:53:50.16 said that yet but if there's anything that seems to be that's why it is jump because I'm jumping
00:53:50.16 --> 00:53:58.08 around from section to section you continue on here it was hard to believe that only weeks before
00:53:58.08 --> 00:54:04.88 I'd been so happy blissfully ignorant of how my life would be cruelly abruptly and permanently
00:54:04.88 --> 00:54:10.08 changed I remember sitting in my kitchen two weeks before Travis died I was watching my baby girl
00:54:10.08 --> 00:54:15.84 all nine and a half months old pull herself up to stand on uncertain wobbly legs she stood with
00:54:15.84 --> 00:54:23.68 her chubby hands on the screen door she stood next to our dog pup and giggled excitedly as she
00:54:23.68 --> 00:54:29.92 peered outside and watched a bunny rabbit hop around the backyard life is so completely perfect
00:54:29.92 --> 00:54:35.76 I remember thinking at that moment I was a happy new mom had a fantastic relationship with my husband
00:54:35.76 --> 00:54:40.16 business was good and Travis would be back in time for the grand opening of my second store I felt
00:54:40.16 --> 00:54:47.92 holy in control and at peace to this day that peaceful feeling sometimes comes back to me for a moment
00:54:47.92 --> 00:54:54.96 when life feels effortless my mind is at ease and all seems right in the world but now it dissolves
00:54:54.96 --> 00:55:00.56 in an instant in fact as soon as I experienced that kind of serenity I become terrified what terrible
00:55:00.56 --> 00:55:05.76 tragedy is going to shatter this picture of perfect peace I asked myself I still wonder if the
00:55:05.76 --> 00:55:12.000 sense of calm I experienced that day had been a harboredger of the doom to come I worry that I was
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.12 foolish for not having recognized it for what it was all the signs of catastrophe will right in front
00:55:17.12 --> 00:55:25.04 of me how could I have been so blind this train of thought is of course completely paranoid and insane
00:55:27.44 --> 00:55:38.88 so do you feel that now to this day yeah you know I I do I don't have many times where life feels effortless
00:55:38.88 --> 00:55:50.72 anymore but you know I I remember that feeling I had that day in my house I remember that feeling so vividly
00:55:50.72 --> 00:55:58.56 just it was this wave that came over me where I was like oh my gosh like this is what a great life
00:55:58.56 --> 00:56:03.84 I have you know I'm like looking at my new daughter and I'm just and and I think I just got
00:56:03.84 --> 00:56:09.52 off the phone with Travis like a day or two prior and and our conversations had nothing to do with
00:56:09.52 --> 00:56:14.72 what he was doing when I rack he's like talking to me about you know what what kind of men's
00:56:14.72 --> 00:56:21.36 brands did you get for the story you know it is a cool stuff and and so it was just like the
00:56:21.36 --> 00:56:29.76 super peaceful feeling and I lived up into that point not really fearful of anything
00:56:29.76 --> 00:56:42.32 and you know I certainly today I'm certainly afraid of I'm afraid when I get a random call
00:56:42.32 --> 00:56:49.04 I'm afraid when my husband calls me twice in a row you know those things can set me into a
00:56:49.04 --> 00:56:57.76 different place they can they can certainly you know I my favorite show was my favorite show was
00:56:57.76 --> 00:57:04.32 big love that was an HBO series on like polygamy and it was really popular when
00:57:05.76 --> 00:57:13.20 scripted series when around that time and I love the show was a guy who was the guy who was in it
00:57:13.20 --> 00:57:20.16 he's he since passed away but anyway great show it was Bill Paxon yeah and yeah there
00:57:20.16 --> 00:57:28.32 you know it was a great show and I remember watching that show and and these are the things
00:57:28.32 --> 00:57:32.80 that you don't realize are going to happen so I'm watching the show and it's like the series finale
00:57:32.80 --> 00:57:37.44 and it was those little things where I was like this is post Travis's death and I'm like well
00:57:38.16 --> 00:57:44.16 you know big love zone that's something I can enjoy I'm going to watch this season finale
00:57:44.16 --> 00:57:51.68 and I'm watching the finale and on the finale like the head polygamous get shot and he
00:57:51.68 --> 00:57:58.80 gets shot on the street and watching him get shot it sent me into a full blown panic attack
00:57:58.80 --> 00:58:05.76 it was such a visceral reaction that I wasn't expecting that it it's stunned me and I was like oh my god
00:58:05.76 --> 00:58:12.72 I I can't see that I mean my my five-year-old walks around he's got a little like pistol that was
00:58:12.72 --> 00:58:18.32 that was that was Dave's my husband's and he brought it my mother-in-law found it and she brought it
00:58:18.32 --> 00:58:23.20 back about a month ago and it's the cutest little thing with the whole stir and I can't be around
00:58:23.84 --> 00:58:29.76 Travis holding it my little Travis holding it it unlike David there's something about like guns now
00:58:29.76 --> 00:58:36.80 you know there's seeing them pointed being shot like it sends me in a in a bad place you know and
00:58:36.80 --> 00:58:43.36 it's it's those sort of things that you don't you don't realize until a little bit after the fact
00:58:43.36 --> 00:58:49.68 that okay these are the residual effects and some of them go away and some of them don't you know
00:58:49.68 --> 00:58:58.08 um and some of them just starve a part of who you are now and I'm I'm definitely a
00:58:59.52 --> 00:59:04.56 a jumpier person you know like I hear something like what happened you know we're before I was
00:59:04.56 --> 00:59:13.44 not like that I was kind of like um you heard something you know you talk a little bit about that
00:59:13.44 --> 00:59:18.40 more here you say the fear and paranoia that follow in the wake of grief can create a tremendous
00:59:18.40 --> 00:59:23.12 roadblock it stunts our personal growth and darkens our overall sense of well-being some people respond
00:59:23.12 --> 00:59:30.48 to unexpected and trying situations with passive acquiescence and others with fire and fury I responded
00:59:30.48 --> 00:59:37.84 by heightening my vigilance after Travis's death I found myself compelled to be wary I was
00:59:37.84 --> 00:59:43.60 always on the lookout for the next great tragedy to befall me this hurled me down some very dark
00:59:43.60 --> 00:59:49.36 and troublesome paths from panic attacks to self-destructive behaviors but also led me to some
00:59:49.36 --> 00:59:54.48 amazing gifts like recovering my sense of humor and living with intention what self-destructive
00:59:54.48 --> 01:00:03.20 behaviors did you pick up I mean I think you know self-destructive in a way that you know I stopped
01:00:04.80 --> 01:00:10.48 kind of taking care of myself you know you I I go into the next place where I'm talking about
01:00:12.48 --> 01:00:18.40 you know I decide to run a marathon but I'm running a marathon smoking a pack of cigarettes a day
01:00:18.40 --> 01:00:25.20 and you know I'm drinking a lot and I'm just kind of like I'm gonna do this but on the same token
01:00:26.24 --> 01:00:35.36 you know this is kind of who I am now you know and you know with the with that that
01:00:35.92 --> 01:00:46.24 hypersense of paranoia you know I really went into some these ideas of and I know what
01:00:46.24 --> 01:00:51.68 I know the reasoning behind it if I can look back and like psychoanalyze myself when Travis was in
01:00:51.68 --> 01:00:58.96 Iraq I was not worried about him and when he was there the first time when he was there the second time
01:00:58.96 --> 01:01:04.80 even though I knew the second deployment was different I was aware of that because my husband told me
01:01:04.80 --> 01:01:09.84 he's like hey this is gonna be different you know I've had conversations with your brother but I had
01:01:09.84 --> 01:01:17.68 no fear of my brother being an Iraq it was this notion of more than anything you think about
01:01:18.64 --> 01:01:27.60 like these crazy stories right you know I spur like you know I sickle falling off a garage and like
01:01:27.60 --> 01:01:32.80 impaling a woman on her head right and it's like these totally crazy stories and you're like that's
01:01:32.80 --> 01:01:37.20 so crazy well I mean it's never gonna happen to you right it's like the plane crash theory like
01:01:37.20 --> 01:01:42.80 we all fly on planes but you know you tell your kids planes are planes don't crash you know you're
01:01:42.80 --> 01:01:48.08 not gonna be in a plane the crashes so you don't think about that happening to you and that
01:01:48.08 --> 01:01:56.24 maybe it was a defense mechanism but that's how I got through Travis being an Iraq I wasn't you know
01:01:56.24 --> 01:02:01.28 I didn't show any fear I didn't show any I and I didn't even have any fear it wasn't that I didn't
01:02:01.28 --> 01:02:07.12 show it I really didn't have it I let those emotions all go so then when it did happen it was
01:02:07.12 --> 01:02:12.88 like I guess when you do this idea of like preparing right where your it's almost like I knew this
01:02:12.88 --> 01:02:20.80 was coming like you hear people like I knew it I knew it right like I had no idea and so to have
01:02:20.80 --> 01:02:29.60 something shock your system that much I think it kind of rewires you where you're kind of waiting
01:02:29.60 --> 01:02:35.92 for that next shock to the system and you know you lead on throughout the book and and I've had
01:02:35.92 --> 01:02:43.52 other things that have that have happened since where I know like there no one is void of having
01:02:43.52 --> 01:02:49.68 something happen you know whether it's random in nature I've had a lot of random crappy things
01:02:49.68 --> 01:02:55.84 happened to me you know over the last several years I guess it's similar again this is something
01:02:55.84 --> 01:03:02.32 I just talked about with Jim Sersley who was on the last podcast was in Vietnam and the range of
01:03:02.32 --> 01:03:08.88 level of fear that guys have going into combat there's some people that are scared they're like
01:03:08.88 --> 01:03:13.20 they think they're gonna die right and there's some people that are kind of like that will actually
01:03:13.20 --> 01:03:18.72 not happen to me like I'm I'm I'm not gonna die and that was kind of his attitude was your your
01:03:18.72 --> 01:03:23.28 your thinking oh that's yeah like he volunteered to go Vietnam he wasn't like I'm volunteer
01:03:23.28 --> 01:03:28.000 tearing to go Vietnam and I might die he was like I'm volunteering to go to Vietnam and I'm gonna
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:36.56 go do my job and and so I guess it's no surprise for some people on the family side to think well
01:03:37.12 --> 01:03:43.20 yeah that's not gonna happen to my loved one yeah I I've never really asked my parents this I don't
01:03:43.20 --> 01:03:47.36 think my parents ever thought anything would ever happen to me ever you know I thought that I think
01:03:47.36 --> 01:03:56.48 they just thought I was just overdoing and just whatever part of that is because I I kind of
01:03:56.48 --> 01:04:00.96 inculcated them to just not never knowing what I was doing ever and I was in for a long time and
01:04:00.96 --> 01:04:05.84 before the war started I had already been in for 13 years so they never knew that I was jumping
01:04:05.84 --> 01:04:08.88 out of airplanes or doing whatever I was doing and so when the war started I was just still going
01:04:08.88 --> 01:04:14.72 on deployments like I'd always gone I'd been I'd gone on deployments I'd gone on five deployments
01:04:14.72 --> 01:04:17.92 before I went to Iraq so that to them there it's like oh he's going on another deployment we'll
01:04:17.92 --> 01:04:23.04 hear from him in six months whatever my wife may be the same thing but
01:04:23.04 --> 01:04:29.20 until like when when I was in a modian my wife was at home and she was going to my
01:04:29.20 --> 01:04:35.68 guys funeral and when that happens every single family member that's there is thinking that
01:04:35.68 --> 01:04:56.96 the person that was killed could easily be you know my husband my brother my son now you talk a
01:04:56.96 --> 01:05:06.56 little bit about just this idea of grief the fact is grief will transform you and you've got
01:05:06.56 --> 01:05:15.52 will italicized which I think is important because you're saying listen like you because I think
01:05:15.52 --> 01:05:20.88 that's what I think that's the discovery that you made in that statement is your thinking hey
01:05:20.88 --> 01:05:25.12 I can get through this and everything is I'll be back to the way things were and you're saying
01:05:25.12 --> 01:05:31.44 no the fact is grief will transform you whether you are grieving the loss of an identity that you
01:05:31.44 --> 01:05:35.20 once had or the loss of a loved one at some point you will look in the mirror and see someone
01:05:35.20 --> 01:05:40.56 you simply don't recognize staring back at you it is inevitable maybe you should maybe you'll
01:05:40.56 --> 01:05:45.84 be proud of what you see and maybe you'll be ashamed at some point I bet you be both I bet you will
01:05:45.84 --> 01:05:52.48 be both the most important thing you can tell yourself is that you get the last word
01:05:52.48 --> 01:06:02.40 only you can determine how your experiences will change you and only you can be held accountable
01:06:02.40 --> 01:06:16.40 for that transformation so these are these are powerful things I wrote a book and I guess I talk about
01:06:16.40 --> 01:06:22.88 an attitude of extreme ownership of taking ownership of what's going on and you know there's always
01:06:22.88 --> 01:06:29.76 someone that wants to make different points or trying I'll be positive about it there's people
01:06:29.76 --> 01:06:34.40 that want to that people that want to test the theory right should take ownership and so one of the
01:06:34.40 --> 01:06:41.12 things that can happen is you know I got cancer that's not my fault how do I take ownership of that
01:06:41.12 --> 01:06:44.40 and it's like well you're right you can't take ownership of the fact that you got cancer
01:06:44.40 --> 01:06:51.04 you take ownership of how you respond to it and I just was out with working with a group of people
01:06:51.68 --> 01:07:00.08 and one of the guys had cancer and he was like hey I started listening to the podcast and
01:07:00.64 --> 01:07:06.72 he's like I listened to your podcast for seven hours a day every day the whole time I was in the hospital
01:07:06.72 --> 01:07:14.16 which makes me feel good about having 500 hours a little bit of that guy but that's what he did he took ownership
01:07:14.16 --> 01:07:20.48 of how he responded and that's what you're saying here look you're gonna something's gonna happen there's
01:07:20.48 --> 01:07:26.88 going to be changes but you do have what do you say but you get the last word right well I think you know
01:07:28.32 --> 01:07:35.20 one of the things that I have people still to this day say you know and and and I'm 12 years out
01:07:35.20 --> 01:07:46.80 from the loss of my brother seven years out from the loss of my mom and nine years out from the
01:07:46.80 --> 01:07:54.80 loss of Brendan right and and people will say you know when does when do you stop grieving
01:07:55.44 --> 01:08:01.12 and I'll even have people that have newly lost someone like explain this grief process like when is it
01:08:01.12 --> 01:08:11.04 gonna end and I'm very clear to tell them it doesn't it never ends I'm not going to say don't worry
01:08:11.04 --> 01:08:19.76 you know in the year it's over because everybody's journey is their own but the fact of the matter
01:08:19.76 --> 01:08:27.52 is that I entered into my if you want to call it grief journey in in a way that
01:08:27.52 --> 01:08:35.12 wasn't best for me right I wasn't it was a it was a process and now when you look at like
01:08:35.12 --> 01:08:40.80 talking about looking in the mirror and are you the person you want to be like when I look in the mirror
01:08:40.80 --> 01:08:50.08 today I'm the person that I wish Travis saw when he was alive like that's and so that for me is
01:08:50.08 --> 01:08:57.12 like that was my wake up I'm like okay so this is what the grief of my brother has done to me
01:08:57.12 --> 01:09:03.36 it's actually allowed me to become the person I should have been when he was here I was
01:09:03.36 --> 01:09:10.48 had a guy in the podcast his name was Tom Fife he was he was he was in World War II
01:09:11.92 --> 01:09:20.96 Korea and Vietnam and he was a purple heart recipient from all those wars and he was a battalion
01:09:20.96 --> 01:09:31.36 commander in Vietnam and I was talking to him about it and like I asked him you know basically you
01:09:31.36 --> 01:09:35.92 know I think I asked him how many casualties did you take or how many guys did you lose
01:09:35.92 --> 01:09:43.84 as a battalion commander and so this is for I don't know 50 or 60 years later and he got choked up
01:09:43.84 --> 01:09:51.68 and when that happened I thought to myself oh the emotions that I have they're never going to
01:09:51.68 --> 01:09:57.84 go away yeah and that's just the way it is and there's nothing wrong with that you know the waves get
01:09:57.84 --> 01:10:05.60 the waves get more separation between them over time but those waves can hit you
01:10:05.60 --> 01:10:16.48 yeah and I think you know what I find now is the further you get out the waves actually
01:10:16.48 --> 01:10:24.80 come it like really in opportune times so I'm not an incredibly emotional person to begin with
01:10:26.64 --> 01:10:32.24 that bout of the first month after Travis's death was probably the most crying I've ever done
01:10:32.24 --> 01:10:38.64 in my entire life but it was like it was in involuntary response like I could there was not that's
01:10:38.64 --> 01:10:45.84 just what it was and I if I was out in public I had on the biggest sunglasses you could
01:10:45.84 --> 01:10:51.92 possibly find because I did not I get uncomfortable when people see me emotional and so I
01:10:51.92 --> 01:11:00.48 I had tried to cover it and but now today you know the way those waves come it's it could be
01:11:00.48 --> 01:11:06.16 something so small that someone says or something I see and it doesn't matter where I am and it's
01:11:06.16 --> 01:11:11.60 just like oh my god and it kind of like takes your breath away takes you back to that place and you
01:11:11.60 --> 01:11:16.48 know I do a lot of public speaking and and I share Travis's story and and everyone's like I don't
01:11:16.48 --> 01:11:21.28 know how you do that without breaking down and I'm like listen that's not the time for me to break
01:11:21.28 --> 01:11:25.92 down like I'm there to do a job I'm there to share that story and make sure that you hear that
01:11:25.92 --> 01:11:31.12 story but if you think for one second that there aren't times I'm driving in the car and a song
01:11:31.12 --> 01:11:36.88 comes on or I'm out on a run or I'm sitting there looking at my kids and you know yeah that's
01:11:36.88 --> 01:11:45.12 still happens and and it and it doesn't come as as often but like you said you know 50 60 years out
01:11:46.72 --> 01:11:51.68 a service member talking about his friends like that's never going to go away and nor what I
01:11:51.68 --> 01:11:59.68 wanted to exactly exactly you continue on here like anyone who is received a jarring knock at the door
01:11:59.68 --> 01:12:04.64 literal or figurative and that's what's important and you again since I'm jumping around this book
01:12:04.64 --> 01:12:10.64 you know there's the metaphorical knock at the door that a service member's family can receive
01:12:10.64 --> 01:12:15.92 but the knock in the door can be anything sure anything that is unexpected in your life
01:12:16.96 --> 01:12:20.56 and everyone's going to get him in your life you're going to get a knock at the door that you
01:12:20.56 --> 01:12:25.76 want to do what your mom did which slammed the door and don't let it come in but it's coming yeah
01:12:27.76 --> 01:12:32.88 I've been to the darkest deepest and ugliest corners of my mind and I've learned a thing or two
01:12:32.88 --> 01:12:39.52 I don't hope to spare you the hurt or pain that comes with a knock I'll read that again I don't
01:12:39.52 --> 01:12:46.16 hope to spare you the hurt or pain that comes with the knock I don't think that I could I only hope
01:12:46.16 --> 01:12:50.96 to share the lessons I learned in the process the ones that have the power to transform you in all the
01:12:50.96 --> 01:12:58.96 right ways and remind you that you are not alone so yeah you you're not saying that you can
01:13:01.52 --> 01:13:09.20 make the pain go away it's going to hurt but there's there's steps you can take to move through that
01:13:09.20 --> 01:13:16.40 hurt that make more sense like you said looking back yeah this book is all built on perspective
01:13:16.40 --> 01:13:23.76 I'll tell you that you know I mean I I couldn't rip this book even five years ago you know
01:13:23.76 --> 01:13:32.40 I mean it it took 12 years to be able to say okay I'm ready to put pen to paper and listen I'm
01:13:32.40 --> 01:13:40.80 no expert but I've got a lot of experience and grief you know so I'm going to kind of share
01:13:41.92 --> 01:13:47.28 share my thoughts on that well it helps any time you can have any time you can
01:13:48.24 --> 01:13:54.56 see something unfold for someone else it makes you able to better handle it yourself just 100%
01:13:54.56 --> 01:13:58.72 that's why read war books all the time so I was able to try and figure out what was happening in
01:13:58.72 --> 01:14:06.16 combat even if I'd never seen it before I'd seen it before you say this in the early days after
01:14:06.16 --> 01:14:10.08 Travis was killed my decision making was more impulsive than rational impulsive decisions can be
01:14:10.08 --> 01:14:15.12 catastrophic and a few of mine have been but they've also been a great way for me to channel my
01:14:15.12 --> 01:14:20.56 nervous energy I think subconsciously I believed that as long as I was doing something anything
01:14:20.56 --> 01:14:24.88 then I would have to then I wouldn't have to acknowledge the intense pain that was overtaking my
01:14:24.88 --> 01:14:32.64 spirit and fighting to get out two weeks before Travis was killed he called home from my rack I wanted
01:14:32.64 --> 01:14:37.12 I want to run the Marine Corps marathon he told my dad that's great travel my dad responded and I
01:14:37.12 --> 01:14:41.84 want you to run it with me he finished my father was then in his early 50s and in solid shape
01:14:41.84 --> 01:14:46.000 but this was no small request after running the Marine Corps marathon a couple times when he was
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.84 younger my dad had retired his marathon shoes forever he thought but he wasn't about to say no to his
01:14:51.84 --> 01:14:57.92 son fighting a war thousands of miles away let's do it he replied he mid-May when the funeral
01:14:57.92 --> 01:15:02.32 services were over and my parents extended family and friends were gathered in the living room
01:15:02.32 --> 01:15:07.92 my dad remembered his promise to Travis I'm still gonna run that marathon he proclaimed to the
01:15:07.92 --> 01:15:15.28 quiet gathering of distraught dumbstruck family members all run to Tom said Chris my dad's youngest brother
01:15:15.28 --> 01:15:20.88 I'm in echoed his wife my aunt Susan one by one people picked up their heads hardened to their
01:15:20.88 --> 01:15:26.48 gazes and joined him pretty soon every single person in that rumored committed to 26.2 miles
01:15:26.48 --> 01:15:32.000 in honor of Travis I was conveniently engrossed in the thread on the carpet when I felt a dozen
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:38.40 pairs of eyes landing intently on my face I looked up now I'd been an athlete in college but that
01:15:38.40 --> 01:15:42.16 was almost five years earlier I'd given birth to mag the only ten months before and I had run
01:15:42.16 --> 01:15:47.36 so much as a five K and ages but those stairs were burning a hole right through my skin
01:15:47.92 --> 01:15:54.80 and thankfully my bullheadedness kicked in all right I'll do it I said I mean how hard could it be
01:15:56.08 --> 01:16:00.32 and then you you get done with your first training run and at the end of that first one mile run
01:16:00.32 --> 01:16:05.60 weezing forcefully and doubled over in pain I gave myself a little pad on the back good job Ryan
01:16:05.60 --> 01:16:10.24 you did today's run you're done now go home drink some water and chill but make damn sure you
01:16:10.24 --> 01:16:14.48 show up for tomorrow's run and that's how it went every day for four and a half months no
01:16:14.48 --> 01:16:20.40 matter how slow ugly or painful the run might have been I completed it there was no 26.2 mile run
01:16:20.40 --> 01:16:27.12 ahead of me there was no 26.2 mile ahead of me there was only today as the proverb says there's
01:16:27.12 --> 01:16:33.60 only one way to eat an elephant one bite at a time so you you talk about your training I thought
01:16:33.60 --> 01:16:38.96 it was cool you you've got Travis's iPod yeah how awesome was that it was awesome yeah came back
01:16:38.96 --> 01:16:46.08 in his foot locker and I'm like all right and he was so into music and we both shared like a
01:16:46.08 --> 01:16:52.32 deep love of music we went to concerts together all the time and so that was like exciting I didn't
01:16:52.32 --> 01:16:57.28 have an iPod at the time so it came back and it was what and I'm like gosh I hope I can get this
01:16:57.28 --> 01:17:02.96 thing working and you know plug it in and I was like all right there we go it's so crazy to think that
01:17:02.96 --> 01:17:09.52 these digital memories of people I mean and even I mean today today the digital memories of people
01:17:09.52 --> 01:17:14.72 are going to be crazy I mean it's just you're going to have all these images and videos and writing
01:17:14.72 --> 01:17:21.76 and posts and all this stuff for people yeah and like even just something like that what is it
01:17:21.76 --> 01:17:28.08 12 years ago you know this iPod you know you fast you go rewind another 20 years behind that there's
01:17:28.08 --> 01:17:33.44 no iPod there's no there's you might have a mix tape I guess well I look it too it's interesting like
01:17:33.44 --> 01:17:38.48 and I remember talking to Travis on his first deployment I'm like let me set you up a my space profile
01:17:38.48 --> 01:17:45.76 it's kind of not doing that I'm like come on and you know so he had no imprint on social media
01:17:45.76 --> 01:17:51.52 at all but just a few years later you know when Brendan was killed I was Facebook friends with
01:17:51.52 --> 01:17:56.72 Brendan Brendan had a Facebook page you know and it was just that that small that small time
01:17:56.72 --> 01:18:02.40 but to have that iPod the coolest thing about it for me is that it wasn't just like it was
01:18:02.40 --> 01:18:08.64 Travis's iPod I'm like this is what he was taking in when he was in Iraq yeah for sure you know so
01:18:08.64 --> 01:18:15.36 like I'm listening to it and I just felt it it felt like such a deep connection with where he had been
01:18:15.36 --> 01:18:20.48 and you know it's so cool about that what you just said you even realize how right you are because
01:18:20.48 --> 01:18:28.72 like I had my iPod in Iraq my last deployment which was 2006 and those songs like what
01:18:28.72 --> 01:18:34.48 however many songs were on my iPad at the time like whatever 215 songs or whatever it was
01:18:35.52 --> 01:18:40.000 whenever I hear those songs right now I'm right back I mean I was 100% listening to the same
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.36 songs over and over and over again yeah and I'm and I'm now brought back I hear any of those songs
01:18:45.36 --> 01:18:50.56 I'm brought back to training for that marathon that's where they bring me back to so you talk
01:18:50.56 --> 01:18:54.16 about the training and then here we go as the big data approached this is for the marathon my
01:18:54.16 --> 01:18:59.04 family and I headed to Washington through which the marathon course runs the night before the race
01:18:59.04 --> 01:19:03.20 we held a dinner for our team which by now had grown to nearly a hundred people
01:19:04.56 --> 01:19:08.56 on's uncles cousins friends neighbors lacrosse and wrestling butter buddies fellow marines and
01:19:08.56 --> 01:19:14.24 naval academy grads all of them were participating to honor my brother at dinner at a hotel we
01:19:14.24 --> 01:19:18.64 invited a few people including Brendan Looney who is to say a few words Brendan stood
01:19:18.64 --> 01:19:24.80 solemnly at the microphone he stared he started in about how Travis had been a brother to him
01:19:24.80 --> 01:19:29.68 and how he couldn't believe he was gone he was a great friend Brendan said I'll never forget him
01:19:29.68 --> 01:19:35.68 and I miss him he'd been choking back tears and finally his voice broke I have to get out of this
01:19:35.68 --> 01:19:40.72 room I thought I simply couldn't watch this tough navy seal breakdown as he remembered my brother
01:19:40.72 --> 01:19:46.72 it was too much I slipped out of the hotel and found myself gulping in the cold fall air outside my
01:19:46.72 --> 01:19:51.44 head was spinning and I couldn't help but feel that I was learning for the first time that Travis
01:19:51.44 --> 01:19:57.20 was gone forever I lit a cigarette it had been on and off habit of mine over the years one that
01:19:57.20 --> 01:20:02.08 Travis had always chastised me about maybe one day I'll write a book about what not to do in running
01:20:02.08 --> 01:20:08.000 a marathon chain smoking the night before the race would certainly make the list but it's not even
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.56 the worst transgression I've committed fortunately for you this isn't a book about endurance training
01:20:12.56 --> 01:20:17.92 it's a book about grief which perhaps isn't so different the key to navigating grief I found
01:20:17.92 --> 01:20:26.88 is to have the courage to allow it to transform you same same theme like accepting the fact that
01:20:26.88 --> 01:20:32.24 it's going to make you different I've had to remind myself time and time again we're only human
01:20:32.24 --> 01:20:37.28 we can only take so much don't be so hard on yourself when you take one step forward and
01:20:37.28 --> 01:20:42.08 several steps back you made it this far you got up today and put one foot in front of the other
01:20:42.08 --> 01:20:48.96 you completed today's run go home relax and get ready for tomorrow's now you get into the
01:20:48.96 --> 01:20:54.88 marathon which is a great story I'm jumping ahead a little bit here but got to my own 19 and I still
01:20:54.88 --> 01:21:01.36 had 7.2 miles to complete at this point the wheels had all but come off my brain was no longer
01:21:01.36 --> 01:21:07.04 able to bully my body into behaving my knees my ankles my arch is everything was rebelling
01:21:07.04 --> 01:21:13.92 I slowed to a walk and began to debate with myself began to debate with myself that any distant
01:21:13.92 --> 01:21:19.04 run distance runner knows well 18 miles is great you should be proud of yourself there's no shame
01:21:19.04 --> 01:21:23.36 and stopping here you just lost your brother for God's sake didn't you really expect you to get this
01:21:23.36 --> 01:21:29.20 far call it now and leave with your dignity and your joints intact so you're having that
01:21:30.56 --> 01:21:36.16 the Quitter's conversation totally the Quitter's conversation you're having it but you're not a Quitter
01:21:36.16 --> 01:21:41.28 so I made one last ditch effort in an at I reached into my fanny pack and rifled through my unused
01:21:41.28 --> 01:21:46.32 power gels and energy beans until my fingers rested on the mass card with Travis's face on
01:21:46.32 --> 01:21:56.56 at November 19th 1980 to April 29th 2007 26 years old I gripped it tightly and offered a silent prayer
01:21:56.56 --> 01:22:04.000 this is it Travis the Marine Corps marathon course ends at the US Marine Corps warmer
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.12 memorial a statue based on the iconic picture of six Marines struggling to raise a flagpole
01:22:09.12 --> 01:22:14.32 on the island of Uo G.ma during World War II it's an incredibly powerful site and when you come
01:22:14.32 --> 01:22:20.80 upon it you feel every bit is tired and as strong as those men huddled together appear to be
01:22:20.80 --> 01:22:27.52 as they raise the American flag I didn't care if my leg fell off in that very moment I was not
01:22:27.52 --> 01:22:33.20 walking up that hill I hustled into a full sprint bounded over crushed plastic cups
01:22:33.20 --> 01:22:38.48 and past exhausted runners somehow I felt my legs were fresh and reality I was probably every
01:22:38.48 --> 01:22:44.000 bit the Frankenstein I had appeared to be at my own 19 just an hour older what I actually looked like
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.36 I can't say for sure and I'd rather not imagine but I pushed forward and grabbed Aunt Susan's hand
01:22:49.36 --> 01:22:57.20 as together we crossed the finish line then I collapsed I can honestly say that I'm a different
01:22:57.20 --> 01:23:01.36 person because of that race pushing myself through that training and navigating the emotional
01:23:01.36 --> 01:23:07.60 strain and physical stress taught me a lot about myself and even more about grief it took me
01:23:07.60 --> 01:23:12.56 years to process my brother's death and years more to organize my thoughts around what was
01:23:12.56 --> 01:23:17.68 to my could possibly gain from it it's only after more than a decade of reflection that I can
01:23:17.68 --> 01:23:27.84 share what I now know and here you kind of lay some of these out first what you don't know
01:23:27.84 --> 01:23:34.72 can't hear you can't hurt you which is an interesting concept what what you don't know can't
01:23:34.72 --> 01:23:39.84 hurt you wait hear me out I know this advice is usually given sarcastically and that can be
01:23:39.84 --> 01:23:46.16 for good reason but consider for a moment the wisdom in that phrase sometimes being naive is a blessing
01:23:46.16 --> 01:23:50.80 if I had known the physical mental and emotional told that the race would have taken on me I
01:23:50.80 --> 01:23:55.36 wouldn't run it I would have become paralyzed with fear and self doubt and my eyes would have
01:23:55.36 --> 01:24:01.60 remained forever fixed on that thread in the carpet but fear and self doubt often keep us from
01:24:01.60 --> 01:24:07.44 knowing our own strength and that's something we simply can't risk if I had never run that race
01:24:07.44 --> 01:24:12.48 race I would never have discovered what I was capable of achieving preparation and training
01:24:12.48 --> 01:24:17.60 our great tools they provide us with confidence to dream as big as we want to but without a healthy
01:24:17.60 --> 01:24:23.84 dose of fearless ignorance we might never bother dreaming at all it's interesting advice
01:24:23.84 --> 01:24:34.56 yeah I like it it's advice I still follow to this day I mean it's it's kind of I am I will say you know
01:24:35.76 --> 01:24:43.68 pre-travus didn't really live with fear right but I didn't really do anything to be fearful of
01:24:44.24 --> 01:24:51.60 and today I definitely have those like I say you know I'm on edge I'm always on edge but I'm also on
01:24:51.60 --> 01:25:00.96 edge in a way than I'm like what's next like I'm like hungry for what's next and I the things
01:25:00.96 --> 01:25:08.16 that I've done over the last 12 years I don't even know if I could pick five of them that I would have
01:25:08.16 --> 01:25:17.84 done pre 2007 or frankly had any interest in I mean had Travis come home nobody you see Travis
01:25:17.84 --> 01:25:22.32 placed a call from my rack to my dad to say run the marathon he wasn't called me to say run the
01:25:22.32 --> 01:25:27.92 marathon you that wasn't even a thought in his head because he knew that there was no way I would
01:25:27.92 --> 01:25:36.72 even consider running a marathon and I've just kind of approached things as like I'm just going to
01:25:36.72 --> 01:25:42.56 do it you know what's the worst that can happen and and you do you have this like what's the my
01:25:42.56 --> 01:25:48.88 brother is dead what's the worst that can happen you know I don't make it I don't make I don't
01:25:48.88 --> 01:25:55.36 finish the race and you know and that was 12 years ago and that was my I remember saying I'm
01:25:55.36 --> 01:26:01.84 going to do the finishes marathon and then I'm going to be able to say I ran a marathon and people
01:26:01.84 --> 01:26:07.36 like oh you're going to get the bug once you run one you're and I was like I never got the bug
01:26:07.36 --> 01:26:12.40 I'm like nope I have my check mark I can say when people say oh I'm like yeah I ran it
01:26:12.40 --> 01:26:22.16 you know and but I don't know what changed but you know here I am again like 12 years later and I'm
01:26:22.16 --> 01:26:32.48 rocking the Marine Corps marathon in a week and 140 pounds oh god no 20 pounds yeah yeah yeah
01:26:32.48 --> 01:26:41.12 yeah and and this is a person who's never rocked before so I go well I we have a fantastic partnership
01:26:41.12 --> 01:26:46.80 with Go Rock the Go Rock community and so I get to meet the founder of Go Rock do you have
01:26:46.80 --> 01:26:53.36 you're a met Jason McCarthy I'm not he's a great guy West Point grad and he just has this fabulous
01:26:53.36 --> 01:26:59.36 community I didn't understand it but I knew that the people connected with the Travis Manning
01:26:59.36 --> 01:27:06.000 Foundation loved rocking so I'm like all for it so they asked me to do this promotional video with Jason
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.28 and to highlight our partnership and we're in Georgia and we're they're filming us and we're
01:27:11.28 --> 01:27:15.76 walking around the lake and he's like let's get Ryan a rock sack and so I put this rock sack
01:27:15.76 --> 01:27:21.20 oh yeah this set up pre-plan big time I mean the rock sack had like newspaper in it so I'm just like
01:27:21.20 --> 01:27:26.80 okay so I'm like oh this is funny because he and he's explaining the theory of rocking is like
01:27:26.80 --> 01:27:32.24 the nice thing about it is like your pace is always at a conversational pace and you know and I'm like
01:27:32.24 --> 01:27:36.96 I like that like I like that I can sit here and talk to you and we're exercising and he's
01:27:36.96 --> 01:27:41.36 talking about the benefits of it from a child perspective like you bring your kids out
01:27:41.36 --> 01:27:45.68 because they're gonna we walk in slow but you just put more weight on and you're getting a workout
01:27:45.68 --> 01:27:52.32 so conceptually I'm like okay I like it well later that night we were at a summit we had like
01:27:52.32 --> 01:27:58.000 a hundred veterans through the Travis Manning Foundation we had brought for like leadership training
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:04.64 and later that night everybody's by the bonfire and we're few drinks in and everybody's talking
01:28:04.64 --> 01:28:09.60 about oh I'm rocking the marathon and it was like another one of their scenes instead of in
01:28:09.60 --> 01:28:15.36 my parents living room on behalf you know around a bonfire with a bunch of veterans and they're like
01:28:15.36 --> 01:28:19.52 I'm gonna I'm gonna rock the marathon I'm gonna and it was like came to me and I'm like
01:28:19.52 --> 01:28:24.56 I'm rocking the marathon and I woke up the next day and I was like yeah I don't know if I'm
01:28:24.56 --> 01:28:30.80 rocking the marathon but then I get back to Philadelphia and a rock sack shows up at my
01:28:30.80 --> 01:28:38.96 front door and I was like oh crap I guess I'm rocking the marathon itself yeah it's I was uh
01:28:39.92 --> 01:28:45.76 I was talking to Travis Mills yeah I love Travis is awesome but we were talking about
01:28:45.76 --> 01:28:50.24 you know I was talking to him like why do you and he was a total stud in high school
01:28:50.24 --> 01:28:56.32 Paul like that records like he's and he's just like a beast of a human athlete and you know I said to him
01:28:57.28 --> 01:29:00.64 why don't you go to like special forces or why don't you go to range school he's like I didn't
01:29:00.64 --> 01:29:06.80 know if I could make it and I was like oh that's funny because I as a young 18 year old kid when I
01:29:06.80 --> 01:29:11.44 joined the Navy I had enough of this right here I had enough of what do you say uh
01:29:11.44 --> 01:29:19.84 ignorance you know I was I was like an average athlete yeah and I was like oh seal training
01:29:19.84 --> 01:29:24.72 I'll make it through whatever you know and here's a total stud that was he was like I didn't
01:29:24.72 --> 01:29:27.44 know if I could make it I was like I'm you didn't have it he didn't have enough fearless ignorance
01:29:28.24 --> 01:29:34.40 but um yeah so it's the same thing and I find that a lot with these young kids that
01:29:34.40 --> 01:29:39.12 there's some kids that want to be seals but I meet I have people come to my gym here and they look
01:29:39.12 --> 01:29:43.36 like I really wanted to go seals but I know if I could make it I'm always thinking man you're
01:29:43.36 --> 01:29:47.52 in better shape than I ever want it's right but you gotta have a little bit of fearless ignorance
01:29:47.52 --> 01:29:54.000 yeah that's a little bit yeah I mean hey I'm I'm using my fearless ignorance again to
01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:03.12 rock this marathon I'm just you know but but that also comes coupled with um knowing how
01:30:03.12 --> 01:30:09.28 hard a marathon is so Chrisda who's in a lot of this book you know she's I've convinced her to
01:30:09.28 --> 01:30:15.60 rock the marathon with me she's never done a marathon before and we did 80 miles last week and she's
01:30:15.60 --> 01:30:20.08 like I feel great like this feels great I feel like I could keep going and I'm like you
01:30:20.08 --> 01:30:25.84 don't understand this that last 7.2 miles that that puts you over the edge I'm like she has
01:30:25.84 --> 01:30:30.64 the fear of the sacred she has no idea got it right where you want yeah I'm like I know so I
01:30:30.64 --> 01:30:36.56 I'd rather be in your shoes right now here's your next piece of advice from this section second
01:30:36.56 --> 01:30:40.88 embrace your support system relationships or everything friends family and loved ones can get us
01:30:40.88 --> 01:30:45.92 through our darkest and saddest moments we just need to let them our friends and families feed our
01:30:45.92 --> 01:30:51.60 wild ambitions they gently and lovingly protect us from our own self-destructive habits they
01:30:51.60 --> 01:30:56.48 list lift us up when we can't go another step with a loving support system we can afford to be a
01:30:56.48 --> 01:31:01.76 little naive be bald be fearless but don't do it alone you are human and you are one person
01:31:01.76 --> 01:31:07.52 allow yourself to be carried forward by those who love you and then your last piece of advice in
01:31:07.52 --> 01:31:17.60 this section and finally don't wait I beg you please don't wait I had no idea how tough I was
01:31:17.60 --> 01:31:23.20 why did I wait until my brother was dead to find out my only regret of that marathon in 2007
01:31:23.20 --> 01:31:28.24 was that it didn't take place in 2006 you know who would have loved to run and train with me
01:31:28.24 --> 01:31:33.84 Travis something like that which required focus and discipline was far more up his alley than mine
01:31:33.84 --> 01:31:38.08 he would have been so proud and we would have had a ball together there are so many things I
01:31:38.08 --> 01:31:44.08 wish I could have done together wish we could have done together I'm not the same woman he knew
01:31:44.08 --> 01:31:50.80 when he was alive I'm better I'm stronger why did I wait for him to disappear before I became
01:31:50.80 --> 01:31:56.64 the woman I wanted to be don't wait don't wait
01:31:56.64 --> 01:32:08.48 continuing on in 2007 if you were to graph my emotions for that year you would produce an
01:32:08.48 --> 01:32:13.20 interesting line a fairly stable higher horizontal line of contentment for the beginning of the year
01:32:13.20 --> 01:32:19.84 a drastic drop in April when Travis died then a gradual climb back up toward happiness until
01:32:19.84 --> 01:32:23.84 the marathon six months later I was so grateful to have something to focus on that helped me put
01:32:23.84 --> 01:32:28.56 the pieces of my life back together after the loss of my brother who was precisely the medicine I needed
01:32:29.84 --> 01:32:35.52 but by winter my line was dropping again the decline in my happiness and well being was persistent
01:32:35.52 --> 01:32:42.16 steady and interestingly almost undetectable I of course knew that my life had been far better
01:32:42.16 --> 01:32:47.12 when Travis was in it but I was managing wasn't I after all I was getting up going to work
01:32:47.12 --> 01:32:52.16 being a mom I was running errands and knocking out personal goals I was socializing and even laughing
01:32:52.16 --> 01:32:59.28 and finding joy here and there by any external the barometer I was improving I was wounded no doubt
01:32:59.28 --> 01:33:06.88 but I was happy but grief is very much an internal battle it's not kind enough to play by the rules
01:33:06.88 --> 01:33:12.08 and it certainly doesn't register on any emotional barometer it can be deceptive and believe
01:33:12.08 --> 01:33:21.20 you're not so can you in fact I would wager that no one can deceive you as effectively as you
01:33:21.20 --> 01:33:28.16 can deceive yourself grief pain sadness these feel like disadvantages they threaten our survival so
01:33:28.16 --> 01:33:34.48 naturally we shed them we convince ourselves we convince ourselves that they've gone away this is
01:33:34.48 --> 01:33:40.32 precisely what I did and it's amazing what I managed to hide from myself and for how long my emotional
01:33:40.32 --> 01:33:45.60 slope continued to creep stealthily downward for several years it continued right under my nose
01:33:45.60 --> 01:33:52.72 until Christmas 9 of 2012 when I reached rock bottom but the seeds of my deterioration had been planted
01:33:52.72 --> 01:34:01.04 several years before now we've talked about your brother and obviously had your dad on the podcast
01:34:02.32 --> 01:34:06.24 we're gonna talk about your mom a little bit and this is how you describe your mom Janet Janet
01:34:06.24 --> 01:34:12.64 Manion was a tough optimistic and focused she made every decision with self assurance as if
01:34:12.64 --> 01:34:18.72 despite any concerns or doubts that she may have been harboring the anxieties the worries they were
01:34:18.72 --> 01:34:26.48 there of course they had to be she simply would not allow them to triumph over her she had
01:34:26.48 --> 01:34:32.40 herculine will power for years after Travis's death my mother continued to be the picture of
01:34:32.40 --> 01:34:39.04 stalwart strength she ached in a way that only a mother who is buried her son can but she never
01:34:39.04 --> 01:34:47.92 let it keep her down it was especially disorienting for me then when I learned a few years later
01:34:47.92 --> 01:34:54.08 that my mother this penant of courage for our family had only eight months to live
01:34:55.92 --> 01:35:03.12 we got the news in 2011 four years after Travis's death a surgery revealed that stage four
01:35:03.12 --> 01:35:11.68 lung cancer had spread throughout her body eight months after eight months later a few days
01:35:11.68 --> 01:35:18.40 before the fifth anniversary of Travis's death my mother joined him in heaven and only five years
01:35:18.40 --> 01:35:26.08 my only sibling and my mother had died my family of four had been reduced to two I was devastated
01:35:26.08 --> 01:35:31.76 no marathon was going to make this loss and he easier to bear I had no idea where to turn for help
01:35:31.76 --> 01:35:37.28 I simply couldn't stomach the thought of picking up the pieces once again I hadn't even collected them all the
01:35:37.28 --> 01:35:45.28 first time in the months after my mother's death on April 24th 2012 I turned to the methods
01:35:45.28 --> 01:35:50.56 of coping that had become familiar to me I threw myself into my work and into my family's busy
01:35:50.56 --> 01:35:57.04 schedule I set small goals losing weight reading running anything to keep waking up every day
01:35:57.04 --> 01:36:07.60 and moving it had worked before had meant it could work again I figured I was wrong
01:36:16.08 --> 01:36:21.68 you know I think when I look at the the five-year span between
01:36:21.68 --> 01:36:35.68 Travis and my mom I kind of I'll say I peaked in terms of like with that marathon it was
01:36:35.68 --> 01:36:41.68 like I'm going to do this you know and and then from there it just became this idea like I
01:36:41.68 --> 01:36:49.12 talk now like when people ask me to screw fend like no it doesn't but at that time I didn't know
01:36:49.12 --> 01:36:59.04 that and so I thought grief grief was over for me did you have any was there any indication of what
01:36:59.04 --> 01:37:09.68 was going to what was going to happen with your mom no I mean if you looked at my family dynamic after
01:37:10.48 --> 01:37:17.76 Travis was killed she was the sparta woman that had taken over and was leading the charge
01:37:17.76 --> 01:37:28.08 and it was kind of my dad and I following behind her I mean I can't put into words the the strength
01:37:28.08 --> 01:37:34.64 that she displayed and and now with three kids in my own I can't even I can't even fathom it
01:37:36.72 --> 01:37:41.28 and so you know I was doing things between those five years she had started the Travis
01:37:41.28 --> 01:37:49.28 Manning Foundation and at first my dad and I looked at it as almost a labor of love it was like okay
01:37:49.28 --> 01:37:55.28 well this is good it's like the small memorial fond and it'll keep her distracted yeah I mean
01:37:55.28 --> 01:38:00.88 seriously we had those conversations like great way for her to channel her grief to work
01:38:00.88 --> 01:38:06.88 through things she can help people locally I mean that's how we saw it that is that is so funny
01:38:06.88 --> 01:38:11.76 because you're sitting there going oh that's fine and she's like got a master plan going on yeah oh it
01:38:11.76 --> 01:38:17.28 was like it couldn't looking back it couldn't have been more short sighted on our parts to think
01:38:17.28 --> 01:38:22.96 that she was just going to la di da around town you know and be like I've got a memorial fun like
01:38:22.96 --> 01:38:30.000 no I mean she right away was like we're going to be one of the I mean she would say things like
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.68 our 9-11 heroes run this was like a 5k run that we had the year after Travis
01:38:35.68 --> 01:38:42.88 uh was killed 9-11 heroes run it was 300 people in Doyle's town Pennsylvania you know a small
01:38:42.88 --> 01:38:49.84 suburban town outside of Philadelphia and I was like this is so cool like great run great to have
01:38:49.84 --> 01:38:55.36 the community out and my mom comes up and she's like I want this to be the Susan G. Coleman
01:38:55.36 --> 01:39:01.36 race for the cure for our military community we need one of these in every city and state across
01:39:01.36 --> 01:39:07.36 the country and I'm like and you know my dad and I would be like okay Janet like like I roll like
01:39:07.36 --> 01:39:11.52 why don't we just try to get like a thousand people at the run next year you know that would be like a
01:39:11.52 --> 01:39:19.44 cool goal but you know you look at where we are today we've got we just finished our
01:39:19.44 --> 01:39:27.28 racers 90 runs across the world brought out 60 thousand people yeah Janet was in play are the
01:39:27.28 --> 01:39:33.28 Susan G. Coleman race for the cure for the military community you know bringing awareness to
01:39:33.28 --> 01:39:42.96 our military and first responders and so you know I'm watching her do that and I joined the
01:39:42.96 --> 01:39:53.84 foundation in early 2010 and I'm just kind of I mean my title was executive director my real
01:39:53.84 --> 01:40:00.40 title was Janet Manions assistant you know I mean I was her assistant and I was happy to
01:40:00.40 --> 01:40:06.56 to be that and to play that role because frankly I had no idea what I was doing and I'm following
01:40:06.56 --> 01:40:17.04 behind her and just kind of it was like you know she was teaching me you know it was I was
01:40:17.04 --> 01:40:23.76 watching everything that she did I was trying to emulate how she was doing it she was so bold
01:40:23.76 --> 01:40:31.44 and fearless like she would she had no problem asking anyone for anything and I was just like
01:40:31.44 --> 01:40:39.20 God if I can just hang around her enough to gain some of that experience and so our time was so limited
01:40:39.20 --> 01:40:45.44 that I was able to do that with her until the time she was diagnosed with cancer and it was
01:40:46.16 --> 01:40:52.80 another one of those just like gut punches but it came in like a different form as opposed to like
01:40:52.80 --> 01:41:00.88 knock going right it comes as my arm hurts your kid was you know being a pain in the butt and when
01:41:00.88 --> 01:41:05.52 I tried to pick her up she wiggled out of my arm and we're down at the beach and oh mom throw some
01:41:06.08 --> 01:41:13.28 throw some ice on it you know and we get back home and she's like my arm still hurts it's not
01:41:13.28 --> 01:41:19.92 incredibly swollen or anything like how I you don't think anything of it and so it's like a couple
01:41:19.92 --> 01:41:25.76 days later I think I'm gonna go to get my arm checked out all right I'll go with you go down to
01:41:25.76 --> 01:41:30.32 our she calls our friend who's in an orthopedic hey can you run an x-ray on me I think I might have
01:41:30.32 --> 01:41:36.16 broke my arm yeah come on in you know we left the foundation office we go in they give her an
01:41:36.16 --> 01:41:42.80 x-ray and he comes out and I just you just you knew and he comes out and he goes um so you have a
01:41:42.80 --> 01:41:48.72 little break there but I want to send you down to my friend pen to take a look at it
01:41:48.72 --> 01:41:54.96 um because there's you know just to just to get another look and you know you get another opinion
01:41:55.60 --> 01:41:59.12 well all right you just told me I broke my arm you're not gonna cast it and I'm like this is weird
01:41:59.68 --> 01:42:06.40 so I'll make you an appointment let's get you down there tomorrow and we show up at the office and it was
01:42:06.40 --> 01:42:15.52 my mom my dad and I never remember we walk up and it's like doctor someone so orthopedic oncologists
01:42:15.52 --> 01:42:22.56 and we were like you know unlike and I'm like my mom has bone cancer you know that's all I'm thinking
01:42:22.56 --> 01:42:31.04 like what and so she goes into surgery the next day and you know you don't know what a diagnosis
01:42:31.04 --> 01:42:35.36 looks like it's like she's got a tumor in her arm okay that's the most random thing I've ever heard
01:42:35.36 --> 01:42:45.04 in my life um and they're like well she had a tumor in her arm we removed it but the tumor didn't
01:42:45.04 --> 01:42:51.44 didn't start there so now we have to figure out like where it came from but that also means that
01:42:51.44 --> 01:42:58.32 wherever it came from it has spread and so it's like another and that night my parents are
01:42:58.32 --> 01:43:03.12 slated my mom's in a bed at University of Pennsylvania Hospital and my parents are supposed to be
01:43:03.12 --> 01:43:09.68 getting the um Commodore Berry citizen of the year award presented to them by general dumpfort
01:43:09.68 --> 01:43:19.28 and so my dad and I um head to the event we come back um and we get back to the room and
01:43:19.28 --> 01:43:26.08 the doctors like yeah it's uh started in her lung it's in her brain it's in her back I mean it
01:43:26.08 --> 01:43:34.000 it was everywhere and not one symptom at all like not one symptom she was not smoking cigarettes
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:40.64 while training for a marathon you know I mean it was it was crazy it was like how does how does this happen
01:43:40.64 --> 01:43:48.96 you know and I've read a lot of studies on like grief manifestation with stress and how like your
01:43:48.96 --> 01:43:57.76 body sometimes can um let go of certain cells when you're experiencing trauma and I think there's I
01:43:57.76 --> 01:44:05.36 mean I have to believe there's something to say to that um you know Brendan Loonie's mom died
01:44:05.36 --> 01:44:15.12 three years after he was killed from cancer so I mean the the coincidences are are a lot um but
01:44:15.12 --> 01:44:20.96 you know the doctors tell us like you've got eight months to live with treatment if you decide
01:44:20.96 --> 01:44:25.92 to go to the treatment route it's just gonna help prolong you we're gonna give you about eight months
01:44:25.92 --> 01:44:32.16 my mom never really took that and was like she didn't do one of these I've got eight months to
01:44:32.16 --> 01:44:37.36 live this is what I'm gonna do she was just like okay I'm gonna start my treatments and I'm gonna
01:44:37.36 --> 01:44:43.52 keep working so you know you're she's diagnosed with stage four cancer and she's back in the
01:44:43.52 --> 01:44:49.52 office the next day and she's staying in there with you know a wrap around her arm where she had just
01:44:49.52 --> 01:44:56.40 had surgery but like it was it was a little off putting because nothing changed it wasn't like okay
01:44:56.40 --> 01:45:02.56 everything changes now what she was like now we've got a we've got a job to do and it wasn't until
01:45:02.56 --> 01:45:10.40 the very end when her health started to take um a bit of a decline that I took on more of a care
01:45:10.40 --> 01:45:19.68 take a role with her but this was like it was like eight months and six and a half of those months were just
01:45:19.68 --> 01:45:25.04 you would have never known anything was different so you know she's going to chemotherapy minutes
01:45:25.04 --> 01:45:29.92 maybe she's sick for a day she's back in the office the next day um very you know she's serving she
01:45:29.92 --> 01:45:35.36 had an appointment um an official appointment at Arlington she served on the Arlington committee
01:45:35.36 --> 01:45:44.72 um and you know she's she's taken calls and doing meetings from her bedside you know and so she
01:45:44.72 --> 01:45:50.80 she kind of kept focus on she didn't focus on what her her illness she focused on everything else
01:45:51.52 --> 01:45:58.16 um and it just got to the point at the end where her body went to allow her to to keep going like that
01:45:58.16 --> 01:46:05.12 but it was it was you know two weeks where she was really where you're like oh you're your sick
01:46:05.68 --> 01:46:10.72 but the rest of the time you would have really never known you know people look at pictures of my
01:46:10.72 --> 01:46:14.32 mom and I'm like yeah that's just a couple weeks before they did she died and they're like what
01:46:14.96 --> 01:46:19.68 could you have you know the image in your head of someone with dying of stage four cancer like
01:46:20.40 --> 01:46:24.08 she just she didn't look like that and what were you thinking this whole time
01:46:24.08 --> 01:46:34.24 I was very pragmatic I was like my mom's dying in eight months I did not um my dad on the other
01:46:34.24 --> 01:46:42.08 side was like I'm not listening to that like there's there's miracles happen every day we just got
01:46:42.08 --> 01:46:47.44 to you know stay the course things will see if there's trials you know they're trying all sorts of
01:46:47.44 --> 01:46:55.04 different holistic diets and and I was very much um supportive of that let's try everything and
01:46:55.04 --> 01:47:04.48 anything but I almost felt so jaded at that point in in life a little bit that I was like yeah I mean
01:47:04.48 --> 01:47:08.72 we got we got eight months let's see what these eight months look like
01:47:08.72 --> 01:47:18.72 you say here grief is a savage and true beast that isn't easily tamed
01:47:19.60 --> 01:47:25.76 as soon as I found a method of fending off my grief that worked for me it caught on and found a new mode of attack
01:47:26.56 --> 01:47:32.000 saying goal oriented and tough minded got me only so far then the year my mother died on Christmas
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:41.84 night at 2012 it came to find me in my home and so your mom dies and you again this is all
01:47:41.84 --> 01:47:45.28 stuff that you talk about in the book these big parties that you guys have these big Christmas
01:47:45.28 --> 01:47:48.88 parties and they kind of go they've gone from generation to generation and your grandparents had
01:47:48.88 --> 01:47:54.32 them and your parents had them and so now it's your turn and so you have this big party and
01:47:55.20 --> 01:48:01.84 you know the the the pandemonium or whatever of a party and the planning and all that stuff
01:48:01.84 --> 01:48:08.96 and then the parties over and after the after the party you lay down you know you're really
01:48:08.96 --> 01:48:14.000 tired from doing all the work of getting it ready and you're tired but here we go back to the book
01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:19.76 but sleep didn't come something much nastier arrived in its place I felt like I received a direct
01:48:19.76 --> 01:48:24.96 punch to the gut and my eyes immediately sprang open I started hyperventilating I couldn't breathe
01:48:24.96 --> 01:48:29.36 pressure was quickly building inside my chest and my mind was on fire with anxiety it was the
01:48:29.36 --> 01:48:33.68 most terrifying panic attack I have ever experienced Dave you have to get me to the hospital I managed
01:48:33.68 --> 01:48:38.72 to get out I think I'm dying I will forever be grateful for what my husband said next
01:48:39.68 --> 01:48:47.20 no you're not stop Ryan just relax and go to bed but then you say you might think I'm getting
01:48:47.20 --> 01:48:51.76 but I'm serious and I did think you were kidding and you are serious my husband always knows what to say
01:48:51.76 --> 01:48:57.44 to me when my emotions reach a fever pitch if I had sensed even the slightest bit of concern
01:48:57.44 --> 01:49:02.08 in his voice I know the situation would have only escalated at the time however as you may imagine
01:49:02.08 --> 01:49:06.56 I did not appreciate it I immediately set off into a flurry of accusations that thankfully I
01:49:06.56 --> 01:49:11.68 can no longer remember Dave the peaceful warrior that he is remained unfazed instead he continued
01:49:11.68 --> 01:49:16.96 to speak rationally and firmly there's probably only a few minutes but they felt like my last
01:49:16.96 --> 01:49:21.36 with the intense feelings of anxiety when the intense feelings of anxiety disappeared
01:49:21.36 --> 01:49:27.20 and my breathing slowed into a natural rhythm I had an internal come to Jesus with myself
01:49:27.20 --> 01:49:34.32 clearly I was not okay I dealt with some minor anxiety before initially when Travis was deployed
01:49:34.32 --> 01:49:39.68 and then immediately after his death but nothing like this this was positively debilitating
01:49:39.68 --> 01:49:43.76 for several for the next several months I was a ghost of my former self the identity I
01:49:43.76 --> 01:49:49.44 painstakingly built for myself after Travis died a chatter on December 24th, 2012 I identified
01:49:49.44 --> 01:49:54.56 as a tough capable resilient woman I was a marathon runner I was a dedicated mom and supportive
01:49:54.56 --> 01:49:58.80 wife I had taken over as executive director of the Travis Manion Foundation the organizer
01:49:58.80 --> 01:50:03.44 the organization my mother formed to honor my brother I let a talented team and people look to
01:50:03.44 --> 01:50:09.04 me for guidance and leadership and I gave it to them but December 25th was a different ball game
01:50:09.04 --> 01:50:15.28 I was gasping for air and cursing my cursing out my exceedingly calm husband I was smoking again
01:50:15.28 --> 01:50:21.04 I crying in the shower and regularly feeling seized by anxiety that I simply couldn't shake off
01:50:21.04 --> 01:50:25.28 if this is what life is like going to be if this is what life is going to be like from now on
01:50:25.28 --> 01:50:30.24 I thought to myself one day I'm done I can't live like this
01:50:33.20 --> 01:50:37.12 then then you talk about communicating with some of your friends commiserating with Amy
01:50:37.84 --> 01:50:44.000 this is Brendan's wife was deeply helpful in putting me back on the path to recovery two years
01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:49.92 earlier she had lost her husband Brendan if there's anyone with whom I felt I could be completely
01:50:49.92 --> 01:50:57.76 vulnerable it was her one day I called her overwhelmed and furious my therapist diagnosed me with
01:50:57.76 --> 01:51:03.20 post-traumatic stress disorder today I shouted into the receiver can you believe that shit I don't
01:51:03.20 --> 01:51:11.04 have PTSD and then you go on and she says it's okay Ryan she told me my therapist told me the same
01:51:11.04 --> 01:51:15.92 thing at that point we both chuckled in a dawned on me that there was likely some truth
01:51:15.92 --> 01:51:20.80 that I'd notice naming my problem didn't do much for me but sharing it with someone else did
01:51:21.68 --> 01:51:26.48 during the following six months I started to regain my confidence humor and peace I slowly
01:51:26.48 --> 01:51:31.76 reclaimed myself life slowed down I focused on my mental health that did not mean I threw
01:51:31.76 --> 01:51:35.84 physical challenges out the window quite the opposite I began to understand what my dad meant
01:51:35.84 --> 01:51:41.60 when he told me to go for a run when I wasn't feeling myself exercise has a tremendous positive
01:51:41.60 --> 01:51:49.44 effect on the mind I was using simple exercise as a tool to help with my mental state
01:51:52.24 --> 01:51:59.04 and you again you go into some pretty good detail about this idea of not just exercise but
01:51:59.84 --> 01:52:04.80 setting these kind of little goals and doing things that sort of give you an immediate short-term
01:52:04.80 --> 01:52:10.72 gratification and you get sort of on this treadmill of you're looking for these short-term
01:52:10.72 --> 01:52:17.92 gratification things to really propel you for the next ten minutes whatever next hour and
01:52:18.64 --> 01:52:25.76 you know whether it's a run or whether it's a goal or whether it's some party or you're just
01:52:25.76 --> 01:52:31.52 you're looking for you're looking for like happiness yeah gratification temporary joy
01:52:31.52 --> 01:52:40.08 but you realize that that's not giving you the profound happiness that you're looking for.
01:52:40.08 --> 01:52:47.04 Yeah so you say this to break away from that unforgiving pattern of searching for un-matched joy
01:52:47.04 --> 01:52:54.08 you need to do one very important thing you have to be honest with yourself no more self-deception
01:52:54.80 --> 01:53:00.56 for a long time I had lied to myself about how happy and fulfilled I felt frankly it was easier that way
01:53:00.56 --> 01:53:07.12 I even lied about things that made me feel happy and fulfilled if I just stay busy I would think
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.32 maybe the story you tell yourself is a little different if I just lose a few more pounds if I just
01:53:12.32 --> 01:53:18.08 earn a few more thousand dollars this year if I can just get that guy to notice me then I'll be happy
01:53:18.08 --> 01:53:25.36 then I'll be okay when we shed those deceptive stories we tell ourselves we create a space where we're
01:53:25.36 --> 01:53:32.88 able to see what actually does make us authentically happy I bet you'll find you weren't totally off
01:53:32.88 --> 01:53:40.000 as I said we all seek some the same things love acceptance purpose we just look for them in the wrong
01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:47.52 places but I talked with Amy I knew that I had found them a sense of community friendship growth
01:53:47.52 --> 01:53:52.16 they were all right they're laid out in front of me and it was because I took a moment of quiet
01:53:52.16 --> 01:53:57.28 away from the activity and the chaos that I got to experience and appreciate it in an intentional
01:53:57.28 --> 01:54:04.16 and meaningful way intention was the key that I'd been missing I was so caught up in goals and
01:54:04.16 --> 01:54:09.84 milestones and challenges and ambitions that I'd missed the simple but profound element that makes
01:54:09.84 --> 01:54:16.16 everything worthwhile and the fact is I'm still hungry I'm still ambitious I'm still a fighter I
01:54:16.16 --> 01:54:21.04 like to push my body and do things I may not quite be ready for and how he hell yes I've still got
01:54:21.04 --> 01:54:27.68 goals and dreams but now I also have something else I believe that the single greatest key to resilience
01:54:27.68 --> 01:54:34.000 is setting intentional goals achieving a goal for the sake of vanglorian sheer accomplishment
01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:39.12 will bring satisfaction but that satisfaction will prove to be short lived achieving goals that
01:54:39.12 --> 01:54:44.16 have deep meaning to us will bring us far more happiness when we set goals that have meaning
01:54:44.16 --> 01:54:52.24 outside of our own selfish ends we discover it's not about the destination it's about the journey
01:54:56.16 --> 01:55:03.92 that's powerful and for me that part right there at the end when we set goals that have meaning
01:55:03.92 --> 01:55:11.84 outside of our own selfish ends and that's the lesson that when I when I hear travel
01:55:11.84 --> 01:55:18.80 this is story it's like oh what made his life so meaningful is that what he was doing was not for
01:55:18.80 --> 01:55:26.80 himself right everything he was doing was that he could be a leader so he could protect so he could
01:55:26.80 --> 01:55:40.88 defend yeah yeah that you know you talk about April 29 2007 is the worst day of my life but if
01:55:40.88 --> 01:55:50.72 you try to find out the worst time of my life it would be after my mom passed away
01:55:52.08 --> 01:56:00.88 it was one of those things where you know you kind of do this oh when I thought I was the
01:56:00.88 --> 01:56:05.68 when I thought Travis being killed was the woman being hit with the icicle fallin off the garage
01:56:05.68 --> 01:56:11.68 like this is like let me tell you about the craziest story I've ever heard you know like how
01:56:12.16 --> 01:56:27.04 how could my mom and my brother both not be here and through that five years I was led by my parents
01:56:27.04 --> 01:56:36.72 largely in terms of things I was doing to honor my brother but it was I don't want to say
01:56:36.72 --> 01:56:41.84 robotic but it was it was these small little things it was like okay run a marathon and it was
01:56:41.84 --> 01:56:46.48 like go to this ceremony and five years out from the loss there's still a lot of
01:56:47.20 --> 01:56:52.32 attention that's brought to that loss in in a loss of a service member I mean you're going to have
01:56:52.32 --> 01:56:58.96 you know you're going to have the local schools that want to honor them at Memorial Day you
01:56:58.96 --> 01:57:03.76 the family's want to be brought in on Veterans Day it's it's those things and they kind of like
01:57:03.76 --> 01:57:10.72 they lead you through the years and and I'll tell you what they're meaningful and they mean something
01:57:10.72 --> 01:57:24.000 and they're very much appreciated but then after my mom was killed or passed away I just felt lost
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:37.20 I was like oh my gosh like I don't I don't know what you do from here and I just handle it the
01:57:37.20 --> 01:57:43.36 same way well okay you know Travis Manning Foundation Board of Directors three weeks after her death
01:57:43.36 --> 01:57:48.72 held the board meeting and they're like you're up you know you're the president oh well and
01:57:48.72 --> 01:57:55.36 when I joined my mom as executive director I joined my mom as a you know it was still a small
01:57:55.36 --> 01:58:04.16 organization but she takes in five years and turns it into one of the top leading non-profits for
01:58:04.16 --> 01:58:11.20 veterans in the country and they're like okay Ryan go and I'm like oh crap like I don't know
01:58:11.20 --> 01:58:18.88 how how to do this I have no idea and I always tell my husband he's going to hate that I say this
01:58:19.92 --> 01:58:24.40 I told him this is going to be the title my next book he's like no it's not but I said like I did
01:58:24.40 --> 01:58:29.76 a little like fake it till you make it so I was like okay I'm the president and and I know what I'm
01:58:29.76 --> 01:58:35.84 doing and you know this is how it's going to be and um and the first thing I did I just started like
01:58:36.56 --> 01:58:42.40 hiring really smart people I'm like okay we're the smartest people I can find and I'm going to get
01:58:42.40 --> 01:58:47.44 them and they're going to be the team of leadership that's going to make sure um that we drive this
01:58:47.44 --> 01:58:56.40 forward but then there was also this tremendous weight because here you had this organization
01:58:56.40 --> 01:59:03.92 that was named after my brother that had become like people at this point like you say Travis
01:59:03.92 --> 01:59:08.48 Manion and they know that name so there's a heavy burden to make sure you uphold the
01:59:08.48 --> 01:59:15.92 responsibility of what that name represents and then on top of it you uphold the responsibility of
01:59:15.92 --> 01:59:24.000 the woman that created it that's no longer here so I felt pressure like I had never felt before
01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:36.24 and I didn't take any steps to say okay how intentional steps to say how do I move forward doing this?
01:59:36.24 --> 01:59:41.28 It was just became the same rat race that I had been doing for the five years prior it was like okay
01:59:41.28 --> 01:59:47.44 God I keep going and that felt really tough to me I was like you know I remember sitting there the
01:59:47.44 --> 01:59:53.92 day before my mom's funeral and there was all these people around much different scene than the chaos
01:59:53.92 --> 01:59:59.28 around Travis's death I'm sitting there and I'm like I need you to do this this is my
01:59:59.28 --> 02:00:04.80 ulogy I want you to go home go back and make these revisions on the computer print it back like
02:00:04.80 --> 02:00:09.20 I was running the show I'm like I'm in charge I'm taking over I'm going to make sure all this
02:00:09.20 --> 02:00:20.48 is getting done and we do the most beautiful tribute to this woman and after that I kept going just
02:00:20.48 --> 02:00:28.88 with that same like do do do like grind every single day whatever it may be and then it was that
02:00:28.88 --> 02:00:39.60 Christmas party where and my husband again you know he's he he has some insight and he said I don't
02:00:39.60 --> 02:00:47.28 think you throwing a Christmas party this year for a hundred people is smart like we are we've got so
02:00:47.28 --> 02:00:55.04 much going on we are so incredibly overwhelmed you're so busy like let's just give it a rest I mean
02:00:55.04 --> 02:01:01.12 I think he was even like dangling you know a trip to the islands or Christmas in my face and I'm like
02:01:01.12 --> 02:01:09.04 no way you know it's all about the memories we have to have it you know and the idea that the
02:01:09.04 --> 02:01:16.56 year after my mom passes away we wouldn't have this like that's just unheard of like there's no way
02:01:17.60 --> 02:01:24.64 and so I continued in that robot robot mode like this when I got to do I have to execute this
02:01:24.64 --> 02:01:31.92 what needs to be done and it was once I hit that wall after it was done it was like that was the
02:01:31.92 --> 02:01:40.000 mecca I'd hit it and everything just came kind of crashing down and you know that panic attack that
02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:50.16 night it was I I've had anxiety a little bit you know growing up in my teens like you know
02:01:50.16 --> 02:01:59.04 what what what I should say what I thought was anxiety this was literally I thought I was dying I was
02:01:59.04 --> 02:02:06.08 like I'm I'm I'm dying here on Christmas night and and it was my husband being like in you know he's like
02:02:06.08 --> 02:02:13.20 shut up you're not dying I'm tired and it was hearing those words like I'm tired I'm like all right
02:02:13.20 --> 02:02:18.64 well clearly if I'm dying my husband's not gonna tell me he's tired and to be quiet you know and it
02:02:18.64 --> 02:02:26.24 brought me down but you know after that it was waking up every day that was one thing you know
02:02:26.24 --> 02:02:32.08 a panic attack a year or something like and I could understand that I got that it was like well yeah
02:02:32.08 --> 02:02:37.92 you had a panic attack because you've had such an adrenaline rush for the last five months building
02:02:37.92 --> 02:02:43.28 up to everything you've been doing culminating with this event that your mom used to host like
02:02:43.28 --> 02:02:49.92 I could justify a panic it made sense like your body was just having that let down and it went
02:02:49.92 --> 02:02:58.56 into an anxious response it was that idea that I was waking up every day and I woke up and
02:02:59.20 --> 02:03:05.84 upon eyes opening I wasn't crying I was like shaking and I'm like what is going on and I hit it
02:03:05.84 --> 02:03:11.44 for a while I didn't tell my husband and tell my friend like I told no one because I'm just like
02:03:11.44 --> 02:03:18.16 so you know I was like you don't want your husband to say shut up I'm tired exactly what I was like
02:03:18.16 --> 02:03:24.88 has time yeah it was not good words in most cases yeah and I'm just husbands beware yeah don't you
02:03:24.88 --> 02:03:29.76 know and and to this he's like you know here I am who am I in the book the guy that tells you to
02:03:29.76 --> 02:03:39.44 shut up when you're having a bad time and I'm like no babe what I do but it was that each and every
02:03:39.44 --> 02:03:47.12 day and I got to the point where I'm like I'm having mental health issues right now like this is
02:03:47.12 --> 02:03:54.64 not just a isolated event like something's something's happening here and to have me go sit on a
02:03:54.64 --> 02:04:05.44 couch with a therapist was like for me that was that was a big deal and a big deal because you thought
02:04:05.44 --> 02:04:10.96 you're too you're too strong for this you know it it's just like not who I was I mean I think
02:04:10.96 --> 02:04:16.56 when I opened up the first time to my dad about this it was my dad and my husband and we were in
02:04:16.56 --> 02:04:22.48 the kitchen and I said hey I'm I'm struggling I don't know what's going on with me but I'm I'm
02:04:22.48 --> 02:04:30.56 not feeling right I'm living in a perpetual state of anxiety and I don't know how to get out of it
02:04:30.56 --> 02:04:41.44 and you know at that time I I had um lorazapam it's like a low dosage Xanx that I had because
02:04:41.44 --> 02:04:46.24 I would take it when I flew you know and oh here's something just to cut the edge when you fly
02:04:46.48 --> 02:04:51.60 and next you know like I'm taking these every day and they're not even doing anything and
02:04:51.60 --> 02:05:01.60 I'm like okay so I finally break down I tell my dad and tell my dad and Dave and my dad's like
02:05:01.60 --> 02:05:06.48 first responses whoa I mean I haven't seen you working out in a while right and so I mean that and that's
02:05:06.48 --> 02:05:12.000 how I was raised and he was like you know I mean you got to go out and run and I'm like and I knew
02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:17.28 that was going to be the response and so for a while I was like well I'm not going to say anything but
02:05:17.28 --> 02:05:24.56 from there was you know and in my dad's defense you know I think after he said that I broke down
02:05:24.56 --> 02:05:29.52 and tears I'm like it's not that you know and he was like oh crap something serious is going on here
02:05:29.52 --> 02:05:39.44 and so you know I got into therapy and um and therapy helps yeah so this is something that I've realized
02:05:39.44 --> 02:05:47.12 so I used to um not really understand what therapy was or what a psychologist did or any of that
02:05:47.12 --> 02:05:54.40 and to me it just seemed like voodoo whatever kind of things right and it wasn't until a friend of
02:05:54.40 --> 02:05:59.76 mine Jordan Peterson who's a who's a psychologist came on here and he was explained to me like two
02:05:59.76 --> 02:06:06.72 two things that he solved for people and that's when I realized and I claimed a term of my own
02:06:07.76 --> 02:06:14.96 called either a mind mechanic or like brain mechanic because when your car when your car isn't running
02:06:14.96 --> 02:06:19.60 right you don't just keep driving it you go oh this isn't running right I'm going to take it to
02:06:19.60 --> 02:06:23.52 man mechanic mechanic and the mechanic actually every day sees different cars with different
02:06:23.52 --> 02:06:29.68 problems and knows how to fix them so a psychologist or a therapist they deal with people that have
02:06:29.68 --> 02:06:34.40 been through all these different things and they have little solutions for them to tell you to things
02:06:34.40 --> 02:06:41.52 to do to to get your mind in the right space so you can carry on that's what they're doing they're
02:06:41.52 --> 02:06:48.56 not doing any voodoo voodoo they're just doing some mind mechanic adjustments yeah and you can't
02:06:48.56 --> 02:06:56.80 imagine how I know for me I think my first therapy session I went in and she's asking me questions
02:06:56.80 --> 02:07:01.12 and you know it's like I'm having a conversation with a friend and then she go okay times up
02:07:01.12 --> 02:07:06.40 I'm like well when when are we going to start therapy she's like I was therapy and I'm like oh
02:07:06.40 --> 02:07:11.92 did she give you did she give you like techniques totally yeah can you give me an example of just one
02:07:13.28 --> 02:07:17.84 so you know there's like the breathing techniques of course like for me a lot of it was like the
02:07:17.84 --> 02:07:24.88 breathing because I would get to like these peaked peaked feelings of anxiety where you know it was
02:07:24.88 --> 02:07:31.28 like fighter flight and it was like breathing exercises to help get me back down so she says okay
02:07:31.28 --> 02:07:36.64 when you start feeling like that here's what you're gonna do yeah tell me what would you do uh like you
02:07:36.64 --> 02:07:41.76 know it was you know you I think one of them was like you're gonna take a deep breath in you're
02:07:41.76 --> 02:07:47.60 gonna hold it for three seconds and then you're gonna let it out for 10 seconds while holding your
02:07:47.60 --> 02:07:55.52 diaphragm so you can actually like feel the breath coming out I developed my own techniques too like
02:07:55.52 --> 02:08:02.16 I have to this day I've developed my own techniques to help when I'm feeling anxious um do you
02:08:02.16 --> 02:08:08.56 give me example one oh they're so girly but yeah um my my examples are not saying I'm gonna use it
02:08:08.56 --> 02:08:16.48 okay so so one of my examples is um most of the time and I actually don't most time I keep my
02:08:16.48 --> 02:08:25.52 my nails polished okay and I can get it oh and I'll like peel the nail polish off fun feeling
02:08:25.52 --> 02:08:31.04 super anxious but what it is more than that wait so that's a sign that you're getting anxious no no
02:08:31.04 --> 02:08:35.92 that's like if I'm super anxious so if you're super anxious you start picking it your fingernails
02:08:35.92 --> 02:08:39.36 yeah taking the nail polish off okay and I put the nail polish on because I don't want to pick
02:08:39.36 --> 02:08:45.52 the skin off my fingers so that's a that's a technique is to let's my technique it's not a okay
02:08:45.52 --> 02:08:50.000 but it's it's something that calms you somehow yeah you know what it is though I'll say it's not
02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:55.44 so much the peeling the nail polish off there it's finding something that you have to concentrate on
02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:03.44 yeah so once I pick a piece of nail polish off my finger I'm not gonna let my hands look like that
02:09:03.44 --> 02:09:09.92 so I have to get every last piece of nail polish off without nail polish remover with my with my
02:09:09.92 --> 02:09:17.28 fingers and that takes time and effort and I just become focused on that and so that it's like
02:09:17.28 --> 02:09:22.16 that sort of thing can kind of bring you into for me it brings me into a place of like I'm
02:09:22.16 --> 02:09:30.24 concentrating on this so one thing that I realize that I do is when when you're in the military
02:09:30.24 --> 02:09:34.88 when you talk on the radio you don't want to sound like you're panicking yeah yeah and so like
02:09:34.88 --> 02:09:39.76 if I was gonna keep that radio I'd be like no matter what was going on it you know whether I'm just
02:09:39.76 --> 02:09:44.64 exerting physical energy or there's chaos going on it always be like oh I'm gonna talk on the
02:09:44.64 --> 02:09:49.60 radio and I just put on the calm voice you know and I think that's when you when you say hey we need
02:09:49.60 --> 02:09:54.32 14 more guys to come over to this building now and whatever one hears you and you hear yourself you're like
02:09:54.32 --> 02:10:01.12 okay things aren't that bad work good so I was for me we're trying to keep my voice in check
02:10:01.12 --> 02:10:10.56 and I think that leads to a sense of calmness even not not just outwardly but inwardly as well
02:10:10.56 --> 02:10:14.16 yeah I never really realized that until I started having conversations with people about this
02:10:14.16 --> 02:10:18.56 very thing because people would say how did you remain calm and I would think about it like oh just stay calm
02:10:19.76 --> 02:10:24.24 and then I thought well what let's think about it what actually and the other thing is
02:10:24.24 --> 02:10:28.96 I would tell guys you know that I was training I'd be like hey man don't you know I hear
02:10:28.96 --> 02:10:33.28 guy on the radio really need more guys over here now during a training operation and I'd say
02:10:33.28 --> 02:10:37.52 bro you need to calm down don't sound like that I'm ready freaking everyone out yeah and and they're
02:10:37.52 --> 02:10:42.80 freaking out yeah and so when I go bro don't talk like that say it again say calm they'd be like
02:10:42.80 --> 02:10:47.52 hey we need to six more guys moving forward and you could see them visibly I'd watch them
02:10:48.16 --> 02:10:54.08 they would get calmer because you have to get control so those are the kind of things that the
02:10:54.08 --> 02:11:02.40 mind mechanic will give you these tools totally and you know but for me it was it was less about
02:11:02.40 --> 02:11:09.04 staying calm it was about like I was afraid of that crescendo where literally it's that
02:11:09.04 --> 02:11:15.84 fight or flight and you don't want to go off that edge and so it was like when I get to that point
02:11:15.84 --> 02:11:21.04 what what do I do because I don't know if you've ever had an actual panic attack I had not you feel like
02:11:21.04 --> 02:11:28.32 you're dying it is the craziest feeling in the world the thing that makes me really which must
02:11:28.32 --> 02:11:33.52 make this harder right is if you like let's say you're starting to have a panic attack yeah
02:11:33.52 --> 02:11:38.16 isn't it like a snowball because you're like I'm having one you might get it coming it's coming
02:11:38.16 --> 02:11:43.52 oh my god I'm just gonna be it this could be that one so it actually it's like self
02:11:44.88 --> 02:11:49.44 propels itself to make itself work well you know I so I was saying I used to take
02:11:49.44 --> 02:11:56.000 like lorazapam when I flew you know and it was just like hey it was like my fear of you know
02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:02.16 flying right I fly so much now I'm over it but people who say were were you scared of the plane
02:12:02.16 --> 02:12:09.68 crashing and I was like no I was scared of getting too scared on the plane you know like I don't
02:12:09.68 --> 02:12:16.08 want to be on the plane and start getting scared so I'm gonna I mean it's like you're your head
02:12:16.08 --> 02:12:23.84 does crazy things you know but yeah I worked through that and you know I was very intentional
02:12:24.80 --> 02:12:30.24 about even when I felt like okay I'm coming out of this I'm feeling better it wasn't like I'm
02:12:30.24 --> 02:12:38.000 gonna stop it was like I okay I gotta keep going and I'm gonna keep going until she tells me
02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:47.28 it's you know how long did that take um it was about six months of like intensive therapy
02:12:47.28 --> 02:12:55.36 where I'm talking like I was two to three times a week and exercise so after you so exercise
02:12:55.36 --> 02:13:01.12 becomes again a big part of it but it's not exercise where I'm gonna run a marathon or I'm gonna
02:13:01.12 --> 02:13:07.92 it was like I'm gonna go out for a run every day every other day because it's what my mind
02:13:07.92 --> 02:13:15.92 needs not necessarily what my body needs I was talking to my friend Jill Rogan on his podcast
02:13:15.92 --> 02:13:22.96 right after Chris Cornell killed himself he like killed himself that day or the day before
02:13:22.96 --> 02:13:29.20 and so we started this podcast and look I mean obviously I'm no psychologist and we were just talking
02:13:29.20 --> 02:13:33.68 we weren't trying to give out advice but you know both of us was like you know gotta get some
02:13:33.68 --> 02:13:39.28 exercise and a million people said you have no idea what you're talking about like I know I'm just
02:13:39.28 --> 02:13:45.36 saying that you know it feels good to work out but then what was interesting was my other friend
02:13:45.36 --> 02:13:53.68 Tim Ferris who actually went through like a suicidal episode in his life and he's and
02:13:53.68 --> 02:13:58.48 and he's like no you have to like get outside and exercise it will make you feel better.
02:13:58.48 --> 02:14:07.84 I don't subscribe to anybody that thinks that your physical health is not 100% tied to your mental
02:14:07.84 --> 02:14:15.20 health like you know I used to think my dad was incredibly insensitive when I would try to talk
02:14:15.20 --> 02:14:21.92 to him about like you know ailments of the mind and he would tie it all back to like you know well
02:14:21.92 --> 02:14:29.36 if you ran or but you know what like he was right yeah he was right and is it all that is it like
02:14:29.36 --> 02:14:36.56 yeah hey I'm suffering from depression go run no that's not but it is it is 100% a component my
02:14:36.56 --> 02:14:45.12 husband runs every single day every day he runs and he's he's he's he's people like you
02:14:45.12 --> 02:14:50.72 gonna run the marathon he's like I'll never run a marathon again he's like I run to live my life
02:14:50.72 --> 02:14:57.12 like it's all it's all for maintenance for him it's just about like in order for me to be
02:14:57.12 --> 02:15:03.92 clear headed to be a good husband and to be a good father and to be good at my job I have to run
02:15:03.92 --> 02:15:08.48 every day so it's cool about this you know for for folks that are listening right now that are
02:15:09.44 --> 02:15:16.56 running into whatever difficulties are going through like hey cool the initial whatever the initial
02:15:16.56 --> 02:15:24.24 prescription is hey outside and then like you said it would be on that then what do we need
02:15:24.24 --> 02:15:28.08 well then you need to go and see a brain mechanic yeah which is what you said you're that hey
02:15:28.08 --> 02:15:34.16 dad it's not about running yeah yeah it's not more runny right which I probably had some conversations
02:15:34.16 --> 02:15:39.68 with like that about with my kids you know where you know my daughters they'll say like I just don't
02:15:39.68 --> 02:15:42.88 feel like doing anything right now it was like well that means you need to do something right
02:15:42.88 --> 02:15:47.68 yeah and I'm sure it's sometimes that some points are going to God my dad's an idiot
02:15:48.96 --> 02:15:56.88 yeah I mean but I want to say that you just said that you're dad which kind of supports my
02:15:56.88 --> 02:16:01.76 position you're dad was right it was right so he was right get some exercise but then if it
02:16:01.76 --> 02:16:08.72 goes beyond that and you still feel the the issues then you've got to get some some help yeah for sure
02:16:08.72 --> 02:16:16.96 um a couple more things to wrap this up along the road to intention I came across countless
02:16:16.96 --> 02:16:25.76 bumps and pitfalls but I also learned some a few valuable truths first don't use a jack hammer
02:16:25.76 --> 02:16:32.32 when a chisel will do when I saw a problem in front of me I went at it with a jack hammer I was
02:16:32.32 --> 02:16:38.16 convinced that if I applied enough force to it I could make it go away but some problems even big ones
02:16:38.16 --> 02:16:45.76 need only a well deployed chisel intention is the chisel I was introduced to intention when my mom
02:16:45.76 --> 02:16:51.36 received her eight month prognosis Travis's young life had been ripped from mine violently and quickly
02:16:51.36 --> 02:16:57.76 but in the case of my mom I was given the opportunity to say my goodbyes I asked her questions about
02:16:57.76 --> 02:17:02.88 her life and wrote down her responses we spent every day together and she held my girls every chance she
02:17:02.88 --> 02:17:11.60 got after she died all that disappeared I believed for a time that I had been robbed I was heartbroken
02:17:12.48 --> 02:17:19.04 and right back where I had started but then I relearned a lesson on intentionality I was crudely
02:17:19.04 --> 02:17:26.88 reminded of how short, sweet and precious our lives are I know the cost of not having the opportunity to
02:17:26.88 --> 02:17:35.04 say what or do what matters most and I refuse to squander the blessings that I have been given I choose
02:17:35.04 --> 02:17:47.36 to live life with in intention your next piece of advice second it's not either or it's both
02:17:48.08 --> 02:17:54.08 and let me be clear intention is not rep meant to replace girls and ambitions it's meant to
02:17:54.08 --> 02:18:00.80 call to them committing to vigorous feats physical mental or otherwise is often a good in its own right
02:18:00.80 --> 02:18:05.36 maybe you want to pass those boards or crush that personal best time or compete for that promotion
02:18:05.36 --> 02:18:12.000 these are all good things these aims are fueled by discipline and focus but they are nourished by intention
02:18:14.24 --> 02:18:20.000 difficult to attain goals and accomplishments are what keep our heart rates up in our blood pumping
02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:31.04 they give us life but intention is what gives our lives meaning it's what makes life worth living
02:18:34.40 --> 02:18:42.08 then this is your last piece of advice that I'm going to cover from the book it says failure is a bruise
02:18:42.08 --> 02:18:51.04 not a tattoo before Travis died I never bothered to think much about failure that's not because
02:18:51.04 --> 02:18:56.64 I was wildly successful everything I tried my hand at believe me I failed a plenty of things
02:18:56.64 --> 02:19:02.24 rather it was because I didn't care enough about anything to give it much effort I was sometimes
02:19:02.24 --> 02:19:09.92 apathetic Travis was ambitious Travis was the ambitious goal oriented one I was just coasting through
02:19:09.92 --> 02:19:20.000 life after he died and then my mom died I had a major wake-up call now I feel I feel compelled
02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:28.88 to take advantage of the time I have left on this earth to lead a life they both can be proud of
02:19:28.88 --> 02:19:45.44 and I think that's a good place to stop on my readings from this book to lead a life that they can
02:19:45.44 --> 02:19:53.60 be proud of because that message right there is just a powerful message and it's a one that I know
02:19:53.60 --> 02:20:03.20 that I think about every single day every single day I think about that and mind you we've only
02:20:03.20 --> 02:20:13.36 covered like a third of this book right here right there are stories and lessons from Heather and
02:20:13.36 --> 02:20:22.72 from Amy and like I said hopefully I can have them on and we can go through their lessons learned
02:20:22.72 --> 02:20:32.16 and their experiences I look forward to doing that but in the meantime for folks out there get this
02:20:32.16 --> 02:20:40.000 book and what's awesome is those stories in this book the stories the book comes to an end and we're
02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:45.68 going to end this but the story doesn't end there because Travis and Brendan and Robert are still
02:20:45.68 --> 02:20:51.92 having a huge impact and we've been talking about this the foundation that your mom started the
02:20:51.92 --> 02:20:58.96 Travis minion foundation which you are now the president of the president of yes and Amy is one of
02:20:58.96 --> 02:21:04.40 the vice presidents Amy's vice president and then Heather is a manager of program manager here in
02:21:04.40 --> 02:21:11.04 San Diego the West region yeah that's right so I mean the the lessons that you're putting now this is
02:21:11.04 --> 02:21:19.04 all in this book are awesome tell us a little bit before we before we stop tell us a little bit about
02:21:19.04 --> 02:21:23.84 the Travis minion foundation first of all like what what's the mission what's the goal
02:21:25.20 --> 02:21:31.60 I mean really at the Travis minion foundation we are we're creating a community and we want to make
02:21:31.60 --> 02:21:39.44 sure that we are giving returning veterans and families of the fallen the opportunity to continue to serve
02:21:40.48 --> 02:21:48.48 and more importantly to be able to empower them post military life I think you know when you look at
02:21:48.48 --> 02:21:54.56 today 55% of men and women who are taking off the uniform when you ask them what their greatest
02:21:54.56 --> 02:22:00.24 challenges it's that that loss of purpose you know they don't have that sense of purpose and their
02:22:00.24 --> 02:22:09.12 life anymore and we have no shortage of ways at TMF to give you purpose again and one of our
02:22:09.12 --> 02:22:14.24 biggest drivers and a lot of it is you know it's speaks to I talk about Travis as a young kid and
02:22:14.24 --> 02:22:21.20 I say like you know there was something different about him but it didn't come without having
02:22:21.20 --> 02:22:28.88 incredible mentors you know my uncle Chris my dad some of his teachers growing up the coaches
02:22:28.88 --> 02:22:36.16 Joel Sherrit at the rest of the Naval Academy is wrestling coach like these were the mentors that helped
02:22:36.16 --> 02:22:42.08 frame him into who he became and so we know the importance of that and we know the opportunity
02:22:42.08 --> 02:22:51.28 we have we have with a group of men and women who basically were taught leadership and so it's like
02:22:51.28 --> 02:22:57.52 okay so let's take this group of men and women who were taught to lead and serve and just say thanks
02:22:57.52 --> 02:23:02.48 for your service no how about like okay you're back here you're out well can you teach these
02:23:02.48 --> 02:23:09.36 kids how to leave and lead and serve so we train veterans to go out and mentor youth and they're
02:23:09.36 --> 02:23:19.20 out across the country taking them through both physical and experiential learning challenges
02:23:19.20 --> 02:23:26.64 to build their own service and leadership and not in a way to indoctrinate the next generation
02:23:26.64 --> 02:23:33.68 to all join the military but in a way to say hey listen as men and women like you and Travis and
02:23:33.68 --> 02:23:41.04 Brendan and Rob like they were called to serve this country in military but as Americans each and
02:23:41.04 --> 02:23:46.80 every one of us is called to serve like we have a responsibility to do that and if we're not
02:23:46.80 --> 02:23:53.04 passing that down to the next generation then we're failing and so that's that's kind of our
02:23:53.04 --> 02:23:59.84 drive at the foundation so we we just want to create a community that wants to pass that down
02:23:59.84 --> 02:24:07.20 and we've got eight offices across the country we've got a membership base of about 120,000 people
02:24:07.60 --> 02:24:13.28 and you know we we we call ourselves the Spartans like and we're largely made up of civilians
02:24:13.28 --> 02:24:21.52 believe it or not but these are people that feel that sense of pride for men and women like you
02:24:21.52 --> 02:24:26.96 you know and they want to be able to eat that up and be a part of it and and be servant leaders
02:24:26.96 --> 02:24:33.28 right in the room backyards and our our organization does not exist if we don't have veterans
02:24:34.24 --> 02:24:39.28 leading the charge and gold star families like they run our programs so we're not a veteran
02:24:39.28 --> 02:24:43.76 service organization in the way where we're saying these this is what we offer to you we're a
02:24:43.76 --> 02:24:48.48 veteran service organization that says hey we really want to do good stuff in the community so
02:24:48.48 --> 02:24:55.04 we need you guys to help us out yeah no it's an awesome program that that I you guys made a video
02:24:55.04 --> 02:25:02.72 we did that I'm in and I went to LA but but what's awesome is they're just
02:25:03.92 --> 02:25:11.92 they're getting to kids you know and the same idea that I had which is which is hey
02:25:11.92 --> 02:25:18.56 there's a bunch of kids in the world and what they need is to learn about life and learn about
02:25:18.56 --> 02:25:23.52 the word that you guys use which I will use as well because it's the right word is character
02:25:23.52 --> 02:25:28.48 yeah and and how do you teach these young kids character well that's you know I've written a bunch
02:25:28.48 --> 02:25:34.64 of kids books that that try to teach kids about character and the values that will the values
02:25:34.64 --> 02:25:40.000 that will give them a better life right that will give them a better life and will give everyone
02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:45.68 around them a better life as well so that's awesome the other thing that's awesome is what you
02:25:45.68 --> 02:25:51.92 just said you know me you know many times a day I get a message from someone that says hey
02:25:51.92 --> 02:25:58.40 um 52 years old and I never served and I feel like I regret it and I wish I could have
02:25:58.40 --> 02:26:04.32 what should I do it's like this is what you do yeah this is what you do you you you help
02:26:04.32 --> 02:26:10.40 propel the message and the message of character back to the veterans from the veterans back to
02:26:10.40 --> 02:26:15.12 the youth that's what you do you there's so many different ways to serve you don't have to put
02:26:15.12 --> 02:26:19.36 on a uniform to serve there's so many different ways to serve and what you guys are doing
02:26:19.36 --> 02:26:25.92 is offering and offering people the opportunity to find other ways to serve that are just as
02:26:25.92 --> 02:26:34.24 impactful I'll tell you right now you go out there and you help free kids get on the right path in
02:26:34.24 --> 02:26:40.64 their life that is the biggest service you can make to the country that's it that's it go do that
02:26:40.64 --> 02:26:50.80 that has such a massive impact and you guys are enabling that you guys are at so so if people want

02:27:06.56 --> 02:27:14.56 more you're a social media because echo is really the social media so it's on Twitter it's TM
02:27:14.56 --> 02:27:23.28 foundation correct on Instagram which echo calls the gram the gram yeah it's Travismanion

02:27:32.72 --> 02:27:38.48 well they broke down some of your outtakes and just did like it's like a minute long like
02:27:38.48 --> 02:27:44.48 wait is it bloopers it's not bloopers it's like thoughts from jaca like no it's cool I was
02:27:44.48 --> 02:27:49.52 gonna say I don't know how many bloopers because they had a big chunk of time like hours and hours
02:27:49.52 --> 02:27:54.56 and I was like how long it's gonna take to like what we got five hours set aside and I was like
02:27:54.56 --> 02:28:00.72 okay that's a long video yeah but it didn't take that long well it was funny because I was with
02:28:00.72 --> 02:28:06.56 Pat Chapman who was the one that that film Joe he was the producer of the the piece and he's a good friend of mine
02:28:06.56 --> 02:28:13.04 he lives in LA and he said I said oh I'm doing jacco's podcast on Friday and he said oh my gosh
02:28:13.04 --> 02:28:17.36 I have to tell you he said you know I got in the car with like I guess like the grips or whatever and he said yeah
02:28:17.36 --> 02:28:21.76 you know we're doing we're doing a shoot today this guy's name's jacco and they were like are you kidding me
02:28:22.40 --> 02:28:27.52 and he's like and these you know he's like they weren't in the military so I didn't he's like I thought it was really like heavily
02:28:27.52 --> 02:28:33.20 focused on the military he's like these are like my key grips and they were like oh my god jacco they were
02:28:33.20 --> 02:28:39.12 thrilled that's awesome yeah it's really interesting the the demographics of people at
02:28:39.12 --> 02:28:44.88 listen to podcasts it's everyone yeah it's really it's really cool and you know like they find
02:28:45.84 --> 02:28:49.52 well this is a great opportunity for them to find a way to serve because everyone feels that if you let
02:28:49.52 --> 02:28:53.20 somewhere in their system yeah if you go through your life looking out for yourself
02:28:53.20 --> 02:28:59.36 without helping other people you'll look up one day and you'll say I want to help other people
02:28:59.36 --> 02:29:06.24 that's just that's just the way it is yeah so those are the ways to help to join the mission
02:29:06.24 --> 02:29:11.12 join the way you said that I kind of got I got it been it's good psychologist that you
02:29:11.12 --> 02:29:14.88 just said you said because since I hear that I'm like what oh that I've been to join it
02:29:14.88 --> 02:29:18.48 so I'm real easy when it comes to things like that you start throwing those words around
02:29:18.48 --> 02:29:22.96 and all of a sudden I'm breaking out the knives getting ready to go to battle you see that
02:29:22.96 --> 02:29:27.92 like new mission whatever you like that you know yeah yeah well that's something that I say all
02:29:27.92 --> 02:29:31.84 the time to vats like when you get done with your military service you need a new mission totally and
02:29:31.84 --> 02:29:37.92 the people that don't get a new mission they wander around not knowing what to do so here's a good
02:29:37.92 --> 02:29:44.72 way whether you're civilian whether you're military to get on board thanks Alex keep the mission

02:32:59.12 --> 02:33:01.92 it's an honor to be able to do it thank you for coming on thanks
02:33:01.92 --> 02:33:16.08 and with that Ryan Manion has left the building awesome conversation and some good advice
02:33:17.60 --> 02:33:28.72 actual pragmatic advice on what to do how to help yourself how to help yourself do those moments
02:33:28.72 --> 02:33:39.36 part of it was part of it was goals right goals with intention to keep yourself on the path
02:33:41.76 --> 02:33:47.92 going out for runs I thought that was interesting because every time how she would say how Tom
02:33:47.92 --> 02:33:53.84 or her dad would say yeah just go off or run or whatever we kind of say that about you just to a lot
02:33:53.84 --> 02:34:01.44 of time we do this go change it's true it's true I'm not going to just I mean we just talked about it
02:34:01.44 --> 02:34:08.56 where it's true but it's not like this that antidote right you know it is for some stuff you know
02:34:08.56 --> 02:34:14.56 I wish I would have thought of this it is a little bit more of an antidote than running in my opinion
02:34:14.56 --> 02:34:22.24 I think so too but just like it's like a couple measures of effectiveness because there's a
02:34:22.24 --> 02:34:28.32 mental aspect to it that completely covers all the mental aspects of running and then gives
02:34:28.32 --> 02:34:34.08 additional bonuses yeah and then I want to imagine obviously I'm not an expert but I would imagine
02:34:34.08 --> 02:34:37.92 that it would just be this very strong person a person you know some people they would maybe go
02:34:37.92 --> 02:34:42.48 live waste I remember when I was young when I'd be mad at something and keeping mine
02:34:43.44 --> 02:34:50.80 on coi mad at something so whatever I mean we are very very mild madness sessions
02:34:50.80 --> 02:34:57.12 I would want to go workout like going to workout and getting under the bench like that would
02:34:57.12 --> 02:35:02.72 help that would be very therapeutic right Annie's to run on child milk too back not
02:35:03.52 --> 02:35:08.72 you know before not anymore but I surround on the treble too same thing very therapeutic I
02:35:08.72 --> 02:35:15.84 thought the lifting was more therapeutic and then jujitsu is like magnitudes top of the therapeutic
02:35:15.84 --> 02:35:22.56 pyramid in terms of physical activity by far too like by far like more than one level like
02:35:22.56 --> 02:35:26.64 too low so you're definitely recommending jujitsu as well you're mentioning jujitsu yes for many
02:35:26.64 --> 02:35:30.96 reasons we've talked about and we're going to continue to talk about jujitsu but when you do
02:35:30.96 --> 02:35:36.96 jujitsu you will need a uniform you will again if you're doing ghee which we do recommend as always
02:35:37.52 --> 02:35:41.04 well gear you're gonna get you're gonna I have not been getting the question one geisha that
02:35:41.04 --> 02:35:44.72 get anymore I have not been getting out there the word is getting out and we're going to continue to
02:35:44.72 --> 02:35:53.28 put it out origin geese get one of our geese and by our geese I mean us all of us to group you know
02:35:53.28 --> 02:35:59.84 because because we are part of this thing we are part of this gang and we're all using
02:36:00.88 --> 02:36:07.60 we're all supporting we're all on board with the program origin made in America
02:36:07.60 --> 02:36:12.08 materials because sometimes people say they say made in America that took me to America
02:36:12.08 --> 02:36:17.76 assembled in America what they really mean yeah or you know made in America oh yeah son and
02:36:18.80 --> 02:36:24.80 manufactured grown oh we do the raw materials all Americans without compromise
02:36:24.80 --> 02:36:31.04 geese you can get geese you can get rash guards you can get t-shirts and you can get jeans
02:36:31.76 --> 02:36:39.20 that's right American general jeans made in America and babba boots oh that's right did you get
02:36:39.20 --> 02:36:44.32 yours yet how are you feeling I feel very good about here's a when are you wearing boots though
02:36:44.32 --> 02:36:49.04 I don't wear boots so all of a sudden you just have boots when are you when are you gonna wear
02:36:49.04 --> 02:36:53.44 they're good I don't know but here's the interesting thing in this goes we need to make
02:36:53.44 --> 02:36:58.88 slippers in order yeah it's a little bit lost yeah but like anything you know when you're excited
02:36:58.88 --> 02:37:02.32 about it you know I started I forgot that in the mainland you guys call them flip flops
02:37:02.32 --> 02:37:10.96 yeah you go flip flops yeah you know like when you get an exciting new piece of a peril
02:37:10.96 --> 02:37:16.000 you more you actively look for opportunities to wear them so you know these boots they're
02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:20.96 gonna get worn official I put them on of course but I'm an old actually wear them in the field
02:37:21.68 --> 02:37:26.40 whenever that means in my case you know in some capacity you're going to the grocery store
02:37:26.40 --> 02:37:33.12 but what's cool about the roots is they're they're not for wearing a grocery store I mean you
02:37:33.12 --> 02:37:41.44 can't but they're they're legit awesome work boots made in farming to make aesthetically
02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:49.52 please I don't like to wear easy wear pleasing but you like the way they look they have legitimate
02:37:49.52 --> 02:37:55.12 aesthetics to them more and more to heavy their functionality is good yes and they're not
02:37:55.12 --> 02:38:00.40 overboard aesthetically which would give them disapproved by me in fact as far as I'm concerned
02:38:00.40 --> 02:38:04.88 they are the perfect boot yeah actually when you think about it they are a boot yeah if you look
02:38:04.88 --> 02:38:10.88 in the dictionary boot you'd see a pair of origin boots like that's what you expect a pair of boots
02:38:10.88 --> 02:38:18.40 look like just why because that's how boots have been honed over centuries to get to a
02:38:18.40 --> 02:38:25.12 point where you go okay this is what a boot is yeah the most the most boot a boot can be is a boot
02:38:25.12 --> 02:38:32.40 for more of your mansion yeah you can get that also what supplements oh yeah now it's gonna say
02:38:32.40 --> 02:38:38.64 when you're on the path supplements they help they supplement the the path discourse yes 100%
02:38:39.68 --> 02:38:44.56 but yeah so it look I slipped off the train of well not the most train but
02:38:44.56 --> 02:38:52.24 because you're right on it all day all day but I had like any crap my wife made me an incredible
02:38:52.24 --> 02:38:59.52 dinner yesterday flank steak just all just good to go nice little Caesar salad these are like
02:38:59.52 --> 02:39:05.28 my two things but the flank steak was just perfect and I got done with it and I was like yeah that was
02:39:05.28 --> 02:39:11.76 so good and I was like about I want something so I just got a little I got a little scoop of
02:39:11.76 --> 02:39:18.000 half hitter yeah that's a whole deal yeah I guess so that's like a deal in a half is one scoop
02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:21.84 right or is two- one no one one scoop is it you can have a one scoop I mean you can have a two scoop
02:39:21.84 --> 02:39:27.76 hitter for sure oh yeah that's not really it's a little bit more what is one serving one scoop one
02:39:27.76 --> 02:39:33.52 one scoop right yeah yeah so milk what it is it's additional protein but you're not gonna know
02:39:33.52 --> 02:39:40.48 what you're gonna think is you just got an additional dessert yep so the joint warfare and
02:39:40.48 --> 02:39:45.44 krill oil this is important let's look off krill oil here's the thing right I didn't like forget
02:39:45.44 --> 02:39:51.84 it I ran out I forgot to get more before I ran out it's one of those situations again so and then
02:39:51.84 --> 02:40:03.20 it's weird how this is what Jade called it it's a type or typing induced tennis elbow okay I can
02:40:03.20 --> 02:40:08.16 that makes sense right beat on the computer whenever and I got tennis elbow over here wow
02:40:08.16 --> 02:40:17.04 right when I was you was maybe like a word stuff right yeah it was like fourish days after I got
02:40:17.04 --> 02:40:22.72 off the krill oil still joint warfare I'm still into that you know elbow cured by the way
02:40:23.76 --> 02:40:29.68 but yeah that's that's that's the situation I see a man as people will ask me which one
02:40:29.68 --> 02:40:34.48 A or B you know should I be on your warfare krill oil which one should it be and I'm like
02:40:34.48 --> 02:40:39.44 I hate answering that question because as far as I'm concerned it's both it's like peanut butter and jelly right
02:40:39.44 --> 02:40:42.96 you're not just gonna go peanut butter you're not just gonna go tell you going peanut butter and
02:40:42.96 --> 02:40:50.40 you're gonna go join warfare and super krill yeah that's 100% yeah and the it and I'm on like
02:40:51.20 --> 02:40:56.64 a pro the program where it's like lifting like hard in this face I'm a little bit more old school now
02:40:56.64 --> 02:41:01.36 like I'm not as young as you see me not a start technique right but oh your old not just old school but
02:41:01.36 --> 02:41:11.28 actually old you see so yeah so this it's saying a lot when I don't have the elbow thing anymore
02:41:11.28 --> 02:41:16.32 and that was a common thing when I was lifting with no joints supplements before you did your
02:41:16.32 --> 02:41:22.72 whole thing it was a big I just endured just endured everyone's in a while take like I'd be
02:41:22.72 --> 02:41:27.36 profanous something like that it got real bad not good for you but otherwise I just warm up more now
02:41:27.36 --> 02:41:34.08 no fact they're gone aside from my tennis elbow but anyway typing elbow type
02:41:34.08 --> 02:41:37.68 in these tennis those tennis I was not playing tennis unfortunately
02:41:37.68 --> 02:41:43.28 yeah um nonetheless yes so yes join warfare krill oil mok discipline
02:41:44.72 --> 02:41:51.76 so we got the we got the jockel pommur flavor which is a 50% iced tea 50% lemonade flavor
02:41:51.76 --> 02:42:00.16 it's the greatest thing ever it's so good oh yeah it's out it's out I said I said it's soon I told
02:42:00.16 --> 02:42:05.36 I told be little I'm like as soon because I had tried the you know we went through all the trials
02:42:05.36 --> 02:42:10.40 to get the right taste when we got the right taste and I was like run this make it and I said as
02:42:10.40 --> 02:42:19.60 soon as the factory gets done making it federal express it to my house yeah because it's taste so good
02:42:19.60 --> 02:42:24.96 better than trapezoid thunder you think all right like currently it's a pinion right yeah so my
02:42:24.96 --> 02:42:34.56 opinion is yes right now right now the the powdered discipline in jockel pommur flavor is my
02:42:34.56 --> 02:42:39.28 favorite flavor at this time I'm not saying I won't occasionally do a little lemon lime hitter
02:42:40.48 --> 02:42:45.20 order trapezoid thunder and don't forget that we also have the cans right this one go and that's
02:42:45.20 --> 02:42:52.64 what I say like the cans to me I like lemon lime fine but the trapex thunder is like there's
02:42:52.64 --> 02:42:57.12 no way I would ever under any circumstances grab the lemon lime one the trapex thunder is right
02:42:57.12 --> 02:43:02.96 interesting well I mean you know I think that might be from your upbringing it's possible you know
02:43:02.96 --> 02:43:11.12 yeah it's very tropical yeah I'm sure then you need to be like over there and then you got

02:44:25.36 --> 02:44:31.84 support yourself but you know get the get the whole book so you can get all the details and whatnot also
02:44:32.56 --> 02:44:38.08 jockel is a store it's called jockel store anyway that's where you can see the guy that wrote on
02:44:39.44 --> 02:44:45.36 Twitter his wife said what do you want for your birthday and he said jockel is a store it's called
02:44:45.36 --> 02:44:51.04 jockel store boom there you go you just as I'll she need you to know because everything that you
02:44:51.04 --> 02:44:55.92 can get there he's down with yeah he's like just order something from there you can order a
02:44:55.92 --> 02:45:02.96 rash guard you can order a t-shirt you can order a trucker's hat I guess if you are feeling like
02:45:02.96 --> 02:45:10.56 maybe you don't feel as cool as you want to be you can order a flex fit hat oh yeah or lightweight
02:45:10.56 --> 02:45:16.80 hoodie yeah you know ready admit it when you see people wearing the lightweight hoodie it's
02:45:16.80 --> 02:45:21.04 good you're kind of getting one over right now one over but like it's weird you're saying
02:45:21.04 --> 02:45:27.52 and I'll say probably not right now little bit though it looks good this like functional functional
02:45:27.52 --> 02:45:33.84 lightly functional and as slightly aesthetic yeah if you want to represent while you're on the path
02:45:33.84 --> 02:45:38.96 jockel store.com this way you get the stuff you can also subscribe to this podcast which is a good
02:45:38.96 --> 02:45:45.20 idea if you haven't yet which echo doesn't think you have maybe that's because echo is the type of
02:45:45.20 --> 02:45:50.40 person that is listening to something for years and doesn't hit subscribe and so he doesn't think you
02:45:50.40 --> 02:45:56.48 well you can be like echo and hit subscribe now or maybe if you're like me you already hit subscribe
02:45:57.68 --> 02:46:02.000 so we know what's interesting about that this is obviously not the first time you said that echo
02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:06.80 doesn't think that you subscribe because that's technically that's not true that's not how it
02:46:06.80 --> 02:46:13.04 went down I was not aware that I believe my own property yeah exactly so if I mean you
02:46:13.04 --> 02:46:17.68 probably just miss remembered it and then that again I could be wrong right now too and maybe I
02:46:17.68 --> 02:46:24.08 missed dinner remember correctly but what it was was I was saying you don't have to tell people to
02:46:24.08 --> 02:46:29.04 subscribe because they're either going to subscribe if they want to or not you don't be like hey
02:46:29.04 --> 02:46:32.56 subscribe and then be like oh my gosh I totally forgot to subscribe it's kind of like no
02:46:32.56 --> 02:46:38.16 obviously that that was my contention anyway so that's more accurate but additionally
02:46:38.16 --> 02:46:46.000 today you put a lot of things on me didn't well do you say that I called it the gram that whole
02:46:46.64 --> 02:46:52.88 line of the gram whatever you say echo this echo that was interesting you say I'm not taking ownership
02:46:52.88 --> 02:46:58.08 of things oh yeah that's true too yeah which is interesting yeah but I'm just I'm actually
02:46:58.08 --> 02:47:03.12 it's nothing to take ownership I'm not blaming you for calling it the gram I'm just stating that you
02:47:03.12 --> 02:47:12.40 call it the gram even though I don't yeah it's almost time for me to read some reviews
02:47:14.08 --> 02:47:19.52 allowed again done that before but yeah so leave some reviews if you leave a review that's
02:47:20.32 --> 02:47:28.64 shockingly creative and good then you know maybe I'll just retweet it or something or read it
02:47:28.64 --> 02:47:34.96 I also want to do the I also want to read YouTube comments allowed yeah we should do like what there's
02:47:34.96 --> 02:47:39.12 a show like I don't know I forget there's a bunch of shows like that yeah mean tweet me
02:47:39.12 --> 02:47:44.40 yeah yeah yeah you should do that with the with the and not necessarily mean ones because
02:47:44.40 --> 02:47:49.36 mean ones people can be lame will you I'm not gonna be like this guy said that yeah you know
02:47:50.08 --> 02:47:54.32 here's a people cry during mean tweets or I've seen some people crying when they're reading
02:47:54.32 --> 02:47:59.92 mean tweets like really crying yeah yeah like legitimate we like like you know like to show the
02:47:59.92 --> 02:48:05.92 power of internet bullying or whatever okay so they're not gonna get me there yeah but oh well I
02:48:05.92 --> 02:48:10.32 would I would wonder is obviously yeah you're not gonna start crying but if you show yeah I'm gonna
02:48:10.32 --> 02:48:15.52 read it then people would be like oh let me make a mean one and then sometimes if someone's intention
02:48:16.24 --> 02:48:21.04 I have to say if you're if you're gonna try and be mean to me through comments yeah
02:48:21.04 --> 02:48:25.76 because you're not having negative impact on me I hate to break the news to you you're not
02:48:25.76 --> 02:48:29.84 executing well because I don't care yeah actually you want to write something cool
02:48:30.64 --> 02:48:36.000 and you want me to see it and be like I'll awesome then that didn't you're being effective yes
02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:42.80 no but this though is what you're saying what it like if you if we decide for you to read
02:48:42.80 --> 02:48:52.08 mean comments uh people someone might be motivated to be like oh let me see if I can get a zinger
02:48:52.08 --> 02:48:58.40 in there and then it's just sort of whack because for a mean comment to be funny it has to be funny
02:48:58.40 --> 02:49:03.20 first then mean said here's the here's the really here's the really kind of just
02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:11.12 thing that shuts that idea down to to to read a mean like a truly mean comment it's not even
02:49:11.12 --> 02:49:16.32 it's not funny you know what I mean you make a funny comment right like the person that got a picture
02:49:16.32 --> 02:49:25.68 of me and it says uh feeling cute might like like hey man that's just funny you know full
02:49:25.68 --> 02:49:29.84 credit to that one because it's a model that was evil echo Charles that picked picture that
02:49:30.48 --> 02:49:37.68 oh yeah evil echo Charles posted that but yes so that picture was taken about three seconds
02:49:37.68 --> 02:49:42.24 before because this photographer this is a legit photographer was taking pictures of me
02:49:42.88 --> 02:49:47.36 and they're like photoshoot yeah you were muddling yeah no they were taking pictures of me
02:49:47.36 --> 02:49:52.80 oh well so anyways they're like I'm like just they're like we'll just walk around and act natural
02:49:52.80 --> 02:49:58.24 and so I'm like walk around and I'm like looking I'm looking in this in this pit right where that
02:49:58.24 --> 02:50:04.08 fences and then I I look at them and then and then they're like taking too much pictures and then they
02:50:04.08 --> 02:50:08.96 started giving me direction yeah that's modeling they're like they're like wait can you look
02:50:08.96 --> 02:50:15.04 over there and then look at us real quick give me that and then I was like no I'm not doing that this
02:50:15.04 --> 02:50:19.76 is this is not me and I'm not doing it but that picture was the one picture that they got right
02:50:19.76 --> 02:50:24.40 before they started giving me directions and I and I told them negative not happening but even that
02:50:24.40 --> 02:50:30.48 picture looks lame man that's debatable you know maybe you know it looked cute might be lead it later
02:50:30.48 --> 02:50:35.44 hey bottom line leave some reviews you know we have fun with them we appreciate cool reviews so
02:50:35.44 --> 02:50:41.84 that'd be awesome and don't forget about the Warrior Kid podcast which I know I owe more of
02:50:41.84 --> 02:50:46.80 this is starting to sound really bad yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah maybe we should release that one in the
02:50:46.80 --> 02:50:52.48 bank sure okay um yeah so Warrior Kid podcast and don't forget about the Warrior Kid soap
02:50:52.48 --> 02:51:00.40 from Irish Oaks Ranch.com where young Aiden is making soap so that you and we all can stay
02:51:00.40 --> 02:51:05.92 clean. Speaking of course also YouTube channel we have YouTube channel video version of this podcast
02:51:05.92 --> 02:51:11.76 and excerpts a lot excerpts on there let's get a little you know chopped them here's the thing
02:51:11.76 --> 02:51:19.68 about YouTube is what I heard when I learned people now people now are going to YouTube more for a
02:51:19.68 --> 02:51:24.48 little bit longer videos than before. Remember the trend was like oh yeah I'm in it and a half it's
02:51:24.48 --> 02:51:27.68 like you got to keep their attention on the internet and stuff that was kind of the thing right
02:51:27.68 --> 02:51:37.44 apparently the new emergent status is the people we like the longer forms stuff we're
02:51:37.44 --> 02:51:42.24 beginning to let you're just catching up with that over there yes isn't this like we've been
02:51:42.24 --> 02:51:49.12 making three hour podcast for years but remember we have a lot of podcasts well no no okay
02:51:49.12 --> 02:51:54.16 three-hour podcasts that's audio right we're talking audio long for okay but yes there is video
02:51:54.16 --> 02:52:00.16 you have we have a five hour and twenty five minute long podcast which on par now yes but as far as
02:52:00.16 --> 02:52:05.84 the trend goes people like it generally speaking more also people outside of the people that
02:52:05.84 --> 02:52:10.48 listen to this podcast are starting to like okay just yeah in general and so what's your point
02:52:10.48 --> 02:52:15.12 of the details of this so somebody excerpts are kind of like five minutes eight minutes
02:52:15.12 --> 02:52:19.76 so that's 12 minutes right right so the times that I was telling you can you please make an
02:52:19.76 --> 02:52:26.80 excerpt that's not 27 minutes long you're saying I was wrong well I'm not to split hairs
02:52:27.36 --> 02:52:34.16 I'm not saying you were wrong then I'm saying that no longer applies as far as like what you might want
02:52:34.88 --> 02:52:39.28 nonetheless there's some excerpts on there well for YouTube channel if you want something shorter than that
02:52:40.32 --> 02:52:46.56 you can go to psychological warfare which is available on iTunes and all MP3 platforms which is me
02:52:46.56 --> 02:52:53.60 giving some short maybe minute minute and a half maybe two minutes at the longest audio advice of
02:52:53.60 --> 02:52:59.92 how to stay on the path and it's not just advice it's actual mechanical tool that will keep you on the
02:52:59.92 --> 02:53:07.20 path very very effective too it's like you're you could go to a therapist to try and get you to
02:53:07.20 --> 02:53:13.52 not eat a donut or you could just press play yeah but there's a donut here the sugar coated lies
