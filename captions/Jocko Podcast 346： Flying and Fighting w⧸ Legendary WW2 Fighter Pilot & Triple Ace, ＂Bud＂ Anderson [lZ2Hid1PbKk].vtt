00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.96
This is Jocko podcast number 346 with Dave Burke and me Jocko willing good evening Dave. Good evening

2
00:00:08.96 --> 00:00:12.42
In an airplane the guy was a mongoose

3
00:00:14.08 --> 00:00:19.52
It's hard to believe if the only bud Anderson you ever knew was the one on the ground calm

4
00:00:20.20 --> 00:00:25.42
Gentleman Lee a grandfather funny and all around nice guy

5
00:00:25.42 --> 00:00:30.72
But once you get him in an airplane, he's vicious shot down 17

6
00:00:31.54 --> 00:00:34.10
Best fighter pilot I've ever seen

7
00:00:34.98 --> 00:00:37.26
He's also the best friend I have in the world

8
00:00:37.82 --> 00:00:40.74
We go back 47 years Andy and I

9
00:00:41.94 --> 00:00:47.82
Andy and I developed a rapport flying mustangs in England particularly after I was shot down

10
00:00:48.22 --> 00:00:52.62
Made my way back and finally got the okay to finish my tour

11
00:00:52.62 --> 00:00:56.58
We were both small-town boys who liked hunting and fishing

12
00:00:56.98 --> 00:01:02.10
We kept finding things in common and developed a tremendous mutual respect

13
00:01:02.98 --> 00:01:04.98
By the time we finished up and went home

14
00:01:05.18 --> 00:01:11.10
We were pretty damn close although making friends wasn't something either of us went out of our way to do

15
00:01:11.98 --> 00:01:13.98
It was risky in wartime

16
00:01:14.38 --> 00:01:16.58
We lost an awful lot of guys over there

17
00:01:17.90 --> 00:01:19.90
We had the same kind of eyes

18
00:01:19.90 --> 00:01:21.90
2010

19
00:01:21.94 --> 00:01:27.78
We saw everything that went on in the sky before anyone else in the squadron or even the group

20
00:01:28.94 --> 00:01:38.58
What made Andy unique was that he flew so many missions logged so many combat hours and never had a battle damage or a boarded mission

21
00:01:38.78 --> 00:01:40.78
An incredible record

22
00:01:40.82 --> 00:01:44.70
It shows what a meticulous professional he is especially in combat

23
00:01:44.70 --> 00:01:49.42
The same attention to detail is what made him a hell of a test pilot

24
00:01:49.94 --> 00:01:56.74
He had those eyes too and he developed the combat skills to take advantage of the opportunities his eyes brought him

25
00:01:57.74 --> 00:01:59.74
But luck was also a part of it

26
00:02:00.30 --> 00:02:02.98
Luck plays a big part in anything you do in combat

27
00:02:03.66 --> 00:02:07.18
Some guy you don't see can always sneak up and shoot your ass off

28
00:02:08.10 --> 00:02:12.10
No question Andy is a very very lucky guy

29
00:02:12.10 --> 00:02:14.14
Anyone who got through the war was

30
00:02:15.82 --> 00:02:19.42
Generally speaking getting killed was the least of our worries

31
00:02:20.14 --> 00:02:24.18
When it happens, you don't know anything about it anyway. So what the hell?

32
00:02:24.74 --> 00:02:27.74
That's the attitude. I think that most of us had

33
00:02:28.22 --> 00:02:30.22
Duty was paramount

34
00:02:30.38 --> 00:02:32.38
Damn it. It's your job

35
00:02:32.82 --> 00:02:37.74
The fact that you might get killed doesn't enter your mind after the first couple times

36
00:02:37.74 --> 00:02:40.78
And so those right there are words

37
00:02:41.42 --> 00:02:43.42
Written by Chuck Yeager

38
00:02:44.26 --> 00:02:48.62
Probably the most famous and legendary fighter pilot of all time

39
00:02:49.06 --> 00:02:54.74
And the words are written in the forward of a book called to fight to fly and fight

40
00:02:55.58 --> 00:03:00.98
by Colonel Clarence Bud Anderson who Chuck Yeager refers to as Andy

41
00:03:01.94 --> 00:03:04.94
Now by the way, I'm not sure if you've heard of it

42
00:03:04.94 --> 00:03:11.14
Chuck Yeager refers to as Andy now Bud Anderson was a fighter pilot pilot in World War two

43
00:03:11.70 --> 00:03:14.70
And in Vietnam he was a triple ace

44
00:03:15.82 --> 00:03:19.46
Which means he shot down more than 15 enemy aircraft

45
00:03:20.34 --> 00:03:26.06
He was a test pilot when being a test pilot meant you were the best of the best

46
00:03:27.06 --> 00:03:29.98
He ended up serving over 30 years in uniform

47
00:03:29.98 --> 00:03:37.82
And it is an honor to have him with us here tonight to discuss his experiences and lessons learned

48
00:03:38.34 --> 00:03:41.90
Sir, thank you so much for joining us. It's an honor to have you here

49
00:03:42.98 --> 00:03:49.10
Was my pleasure, Joe. That's quite the praise from General Yeager. You got there

50
00:03:50.30 --> 00:03:52.30
He wrote it

51
00:03:52.30 --> 00:04:03.22
So I guess we can jump into this I know I know you were born January 13th 1922 and

52
00:04:04.42 --> 00:04:06.42
Right now the date is

53
00:04:06.70 --> 00:04:08.70
August 3rd 2022

54
00:04:09.46 --> 00:04:14.58
Which means you got the you got the triple digits in your age up there at a hundred

55
00:04:16.70 --> 00:04:18.98
That's pretty impressive. What's the keys to your health?

56
00:04:19.70 --> 00:04:21.42
No minor vices

57
00:04:21.42 --> 00:04:23.06
There you go

58
00:04:23.06 --> 00:04:25.06
That'll do it

59
00:04:25.94 --> 00:04:29.14
You got some kind of just to get to know you a little bit

60
00:04:29.14 --> 00:04:32.58
I want to read a little section from the book here and

61
00:04:33.22 --> 00:04:42.14
It says I was the third of my father's four children born January 13th 1922 in Oakland where my mom's parents lived Friday the 13th

62
00:04:42.14 --> 00:04:49.34
It was if it's an unlucky day, you couldn't prove it by me. I've been pretty lucky. I never was superstitious

63
00:04:49.34 --> 00:04:56.98
It says Clarence a meal. Is that right a meal Anderson, Jr. On my birth certificate

64
00:04:57.70 --> 00:05:00.98
But few call me Clarence or junior and none call me a meal

65
00:05:01.66 --> 00:05:06.14
When I was young my family nicknamed me buddy, which in time became bud

66
00:05:06.82 --> 00:05:12.46
The men I flew with used Andy because all Anderson's are automatically Andy. I

67
00:05:13.14 --> 00:05:15.14
Can attest to that

68
00:05:15.14 --> 00:05:21.30
The first thing I remember is Lindbergh making it across the Atlantic when he when I was just five

69
00:05:21.30 --> 00:05:26.26
I have no idea why somebody flying from one place to another should have made such a lasting impression

70
00:05:26.74 --> 00:05:29.82
But it kindled an interest in airplanes that would last a lifetime

71
00:05:30.46 --> 00:05:37.34
When I was seven my father took me to Sacramento to a little dirt airfield with one little hangar where a fellow named

72
00:05:37.98 --> 00:05:39.98
Ingvald Fager Scott

73
00:05:39.98 --> 00:05:45.30
Made or supplemented his living by taking people up for rides in a Steerman biplane

74
00:05:45.82 --> 00:05:49.38
The airfield was an Auburn Boulevard near Watt Avenue

75
00:05:49.38 --> 00:05:53.54
I can remember being excited and a little bit frightened the incredible

76
00:05:54.06 --> 00:06:00.82
intoxicating smell of the gasoline oil and airplane dope like a new car smell and the throaty sound of the engine

77
00:06:01.06 --> 00:06:04.34
most of all I remember flying over our house and

78
00:06:04.34 --> 00:06:13.02
Circling tightly the pilot standing the plane on its side. It's a pretty awesome introduction to aviation

79
00:06:15.62 --> 00:06:22.42
The the biplane was the first thing you flew in huh? Yes, and so that's just a big giant open cockpit

80
00:06:23.18 --> 00:06:26.98
Was your dad with you or is only a two seat? Yeah, it was a three-seater

81
00:06:27.14 --> 00:06:32.06
Okay, you know the pilot in the back and then side by side seats

82
00:06:32.06 --> 00:06:34.06
Hmm. Okay in the front

83
00:06:34.58 --> 00:06:36.70
And he buzzed your house. Yeah

84
00:06:37.70 --> 00:06:43.96
So you could say your dad is partially to blame for your fascination with flying he supported my

85
00:06:44.82 --> 00:06:46.82
my

86
00:06:47.14 --> 00:06:52.46
Likes mm-hmm. So what did you what did your mom and dad do when you were growing up?

87
00:06:53.74 --> 00:06:58.82
Well, I grew up on a farm and that's what we did we farmed

88
00:06:58.82 --> 00:07:05.42
And that means you were probably working more than most people work in their lives. Yeah, I had

89
00:07:06.14 --> 00:07:08.14
Yeah pretty heavy

90
00:07:08.30 --> 00:07:10.14
chores and

91
00:07:10.14 --> 00:07:13.42
Then later on is a depression

92
00:07:16.14 --> 00:07:18.14
Hip

93
00:07:18.14 --> 00:07:20.14
My mom had to go

94
00:07:20.74 --> 00:07:22.74
Go to go back to work

95
00:07:23.54 --> 00:07:27.02
And she went and found a job in

96
00:07:27.02 --> 00:07:28.30
the

97
00:07:28.30 --> 00:07:30.30
governor's office and

98
00:07:30.90 --> 00:07:36.42
She was just a typist and everything and then worked her way up to office manager

99
00:07:37.62 --> 00:07:42.02
And then it was it was in that oldies a spoiled system

100
00:07:42.54 --> 00:07:45.98
So when a new governor came in they fired everybody

101
00:07:46.46 --> 00:07:48.50
and then

102
00:07:48.50 --> 00:07:50.50
they kept her to

103
00:07:50.50 --> 00:07:57.26
You know tie in got it and then pretty soon they they

104
00:07:58.18 --> 00:08:00.18
Dropped her salary and everything

105
00:08:01.22 --> 00:08:03.42
but suddenly soon they

106
00:08:05.66 --> 00:08:14.14
Said why don't you stay brought her salary back up and then she's went through about four governors like that

107
00:08:15.10 --> 00:08:18.06
Pretty pretty awesome. Yeah, I mean

108
00:08:18.06 --> 00:08:19.42
It

109
00:08:19.42 --> 00:08:26.26
Wait for the depression and being in a farmer during the depression. Yeah, how rough was that for for the family?

110
00:08:29.70 --> 00:08:37.90
Well at least we we didn't suffer too bad from food because we manufactured food, right?

111
00:08:39.58 --> 00:08:41.58
We raised chicken was an

112
00:08:41.58 --> 00:08:46.78
Um, good lots of vegetables and fruit of course

113
00:08:48.06 --> 00:08:51.42
so a lot of canning and

114
00:08:53.18 --> 00:08:58.22
So as a kid, I don't remember being hungry at any time. Wow

115
00:08:58.66 --> 00:09:04.18
Well, that's a definitely a good family business to have during the depression being a farmer

116
00:09:04.18 --> 00:09:11.22
And so but you still had to go to school, right? Oh, yeah, and I know you played you played sports in school. I

117
00:09:12.02 --> 00:09:13.62
was I

118
00:09:13.62 --> 00:09:19.86
Like the basketball, but I was kind of small so I could only play on the sea and the

119
00:09:20.98 --> 00:09:22.98
meetings I

120
00:09:23.06 --> 00:09:25.06
Could never go to the varsity

121
00:09:25.06 --> 00:09:34.90
But it sounds like you know in the book you talk about sounds like your dad not only encourage you with flying but he put a lot of

122
00:09:35.30 --> 00:09:37.06
He put a lot of

123
00:09:37.06 --> 00:09:40.66
It seemed like he put a lot of trust in you even as a young kid a lot of responsibility

124
00:09:40.66 --> 00:09:47.90
I know you and you know, I get asked a lot of questions about parenting and at one point you crashed your car

125
00:09:47.90 --> 00:09:52.90
How that happened oh

126
00:09:55.10 --> 00:09:57.10
Young and

127
00:09:57.54 --> 00:10:02.62
Young and scared hit the wrong pedal. Yeah. Well, yeah, well

128
00:10:04.30 --> 00:10:06.30
As you came up

129
00:10:06.62 --> 00:10:12.94
You can't see that here, but there's a double road at the front door

130
00:10:12.94 --> 00:10:17.70
and it always went on the inner inner road, you know and

131
00:10:19.26 --> 00:10:21.26
So I came around the corner

132
00:10:22.02 --> 00:10:26.22
He's an he's behind the wheel and I'm over here

133
00:10:27.22 --> 00:10:30.58
Steering and you know with the foot pedal too

134
00:10:31.62 --> 00:10:33.62
and so I come up to

135
00:10:34.82 --> 00:10:37.98
Go down the road and oh it's blocked by a car

136
00:10:37.98 --> 00:10:45.62
So I said oh I gotta gotta get over here in the left and get on my bypass and

137
00:10:46.50 --> 00:10:48.50
and a big

138
00:10:48.74 --> 00:10:56.70
Tree was coming up and I went to the middle and pushed down on accelerator and ducked my head under the

139
00:10:57.66 --> 00:11:00.86
dash I think and dad was

140
00:11:00.86 --> 00:11:08.66
It he was trying to get me to get out of there, you know, but I was I don't know

141
00:11:08.66 --> 00:11:10.66
It's just a bad bad thing

142
00:11:11.18 --> 00:11:14.62
But the interesting thing is how he kind of handled that, you know

143
00:11:14.62 --> 00:11:20.02
He kind of got you right back on the horse as they say. Oh, yeah, you know, how if you go through a

144
00:11:22.58 --> 00:11:24.58
Terrifying experience

145
00:11:24.58 --> 00:11:29.58
It's best to get them back on back online

146
00:11:31.02 --> 00:11:36.50
Now speaking of terrifying experiences for someone that has aspirations of being a pilot

147
00:11:36.50 --> 00:11:41.18
I know there was a plane crash that took place in your hometown

148
00:11:41.86 --> 00:11:46.42
How did that impact you and how did that steer you away from wanting to be a pilot?

149
00:11:46.42 --> 00:11:51.66
well, I had a buddy down there in Lumas nearby town and

150
00:11:51.66 --> 00:12:01.66
He and I were just kind of nuts about anything aviation is this Jack. Yeah, Jack Sacker and

151
00:12:02.86 --> 00:12:04.86
so

152
00:12:05.18 --> 00:12:08.42
This was something we had to investigate personally

153
00:12:09.42 --> 00:12:11.42
And it was an old Boeing

154
00:12:12.10 --> 00:12:14.42
Byplane three engine by plane

155
00:12:15.34 --> 00:12:17.34
He crashed in the

156
00:12:17.34 --> 00:12:22.74
On the side of a hill not too heavy

157
00:12:23.26 --> 00:12:31.90
Dan well, you know was the whole fuselage was there and the other parts of it got in order in the area

158
00:12:33.18 --> 00:12:35.18
and

159
00:12:35.78 --> 00:12:39.50
So we just had to we just had to see what it was like

160
00:12:40.90 --> 00:12:46.26
Yeah, and I guess in those days, there's no black box. There's no real way to tell what had even gone wrong

161
00:12:46.26 --> 00:12:47.86
No

162
00:12:47.86 --> 00:12:50.06
But you looked at that and said

163
00:12:50.90 --> 00:12:52.90
Still seems like a good

164
00:12:52.90 --> 00:12:57.50
Seems like a good job. I want well, maybe we want to fly fighters

165
00:13:02.78 --> 00:13:08.58
So I'm gonna fat and by the way, I'm gonna read some chunks of the book the book is fantastic

166
00:13:09.18 --> 00:13:13.62
Get just order the book right now. It's just an incredible book with so many details in it

167
00:13:13.62 --> 00:13:17.70
I'm gonna fast forward a little bit. You say right after graduation

168
00:13:17.74 --> 00:13:23.38
I was working out in the yard when a car came chattering into the drive a fellow climbed out

169
00:13:23.54 --> 00:13:28.42
Extended his hand showed me his teeth and started telling me in a practice salesman's pitch

170
00:13:28.62 --> 00:13:32.18
About this trade school and down down in Los Angeles or someplace

171
00:13:32.58 --> 00:13:38.70
He said they could teach me all about refrigeration a good solid career and he pulled a bunch of brochures from his bag

172
00:13:38.70 --> 00:13:44.30
I'm thinking how college would have been nice, but I've got to do something and then dad came around the corner

173
00:13:44.90 --> 00:13:47.06
We hadn't talked much about the future

174
00:13:47.06 --> 00:13:52.46
We talked more about Arthur J. Lewis the several months previous than we'd ever talked about my future

175
00:13:52.94 --> 00:13:57.42
But there and then in the yard. I learned that my dad was pretty shrewd and supportive

176
00:13:57.74 --> 00:14:05.18
Go on get out of here. He told the salesman gruffly my boy is going to college and then he's going into the Army Air Corps

177
00:14:06.38 --> 00:14:08.38
so he

178
00:14:08.38 --> 00:14:15.82
He was convinced that this is what you were going to do. Yeah, and he was fully supportive. I think was the other way around

179
00:14:20.26 --> 00:14:26.30
Fast forward a little bit you say there were three requirements for enlisting in the Army Air Corps beyond passing the physical

180
00:14:26.30 --> 00:14:31.90
You needed two years of college. I figured to complete the course in June 1941

181
00:14:31.90 --> 00:14:33.90
You had to be at least 20 years old

182
00:14:33.90 --> 00:14:38.74
Which I would be on January 13th, 1942 and you had to be single

183
00:14:39.30 --> 00:14:42.38
Which seems simple enough since I had no good prospects

184
00:14:43.90 --> 00:14:51.90
This course of study would qualify me and if it turned out I couldn't fly for some reason then at least I could fix or build airplanes

185
00:14:53.26 --> 00:14:57.70
So that's what you're thinking. You're focused on getting into the Army Air Corps. There's some

186
00:14:58.58 --> 00:15:02.02
Pretty minimal requirements really to go and enlist. I

187
00:15:02.02 --> 00:15:08.22
Mean not being married sounds like you were trying the field but hadn't turned anything out yet

188
00:15:09.10 --> 00:15:14.82
So you were all right there. Well, you're physical with something you you know your eyes

189
00:15:19.02 --> 00:15:22.78
Did you know when they gave you the physical that your eyes were awesome I

190
00:15:26.10 --> 00:15:28.10
Can't remember I think maybe

191
00:15:28.10 --> 00:15:36.10
We did go get a air dock to give me a flight physical. I don't really I

192
00:15:37.06 --> 00:15:39.06
Don't really remember

193
00:15:39.58 --> 00:15:41.30
You end up

194
00:15:41.30 --> 00:15:44.02
Taking flying lessons so you're learning how to fly

195
00:15:45.02 --> 00:15:48.70
And you say this my instructor Dale Hunter was an old guy

196
00:15:49.86 --> 00:15:55.62
24 maybe I don't remember that learning was terribly difficult on the daily rating sheets

197
00:15:55.62 --> 00:16:00.18
There were 36 descriptive words or phrases some positive some otherwise

198
00:16:00.42 --> 00:16:03.98
All or none of which the instructor could check after each lesson

199
00:16:04.58 --> 00:16:09.02
The four he marked after my first flight March 4th 1941 war

200
00:16:10.10 --> 00:16:15.18
cooperative rough on controls careful poor coordination on

201
00:16:16.42 --> 00:16:22.50
March 27th the day that I soloed he put a mark by erratic by the end of May

202
00:16:22.50 --> 00:16:29.18
After 37 hours in the cub he would check only eager to learn and consistent

203
00:16:29.18 --> 00:16:33.74
I don't remember a lot of compliments, but I soloed after the standard eight hours of instruction

204
00:16:33.90 --> 00:16:37.22
Did everything pretty much by the numbers got my license no problem

205
00:16:37.82 --> 00:16:43.50
So there you go. You're learning how to fly pretty pretty quick. It seems like yeah, I was

206
00:16:45.74 --> 00:16:47.74
What I guess

207
00:16:47.74 --> 00:16:52.14
17 or 18 yeah, it

208
00:16:54.18 --> 00:16:56.18
Was a government program

209
00:16:58.26 --> 00:17:00.58
Civilian pilot training program and

210
00:17:02.02 --> 00:17:04.02
With no commitment no

211
00:17:05.54 --> 00:17:07.54
Finance, oh, I think it was a

212
00:17:08.74 --> 00:17:12.90
insurance policy for my parents and $9.50

213
00:17:15.26 --> 00:17:16.66
and

214
00:17:16.66 --> 00:17:21.18
It was a pretty good deal. So I globed on to it while I was going to

215
00:17:22.50 --> 00:17:26.86
Junior college so so what year was that that you soloed for the first time?

216
00:17:27.62 --> 00:17:31.78
41 so that was 1941. Yeah, so spring

217
00:17:32.38 --> 00:17:38.70
So when did so when did Pearl Harbor happen? So it happened December 7th. Yeah, so you were already flying

218
00:17:38.70 --> 00:17:41.42
But you weren't old enough to enlist yet, correct

219
00:17:41.42 --> 00:17:43.42
and

220
00:17:44.58 --> 00:17:46.70
We were I went to work

221
00:17:49.62 --> 00:17:51.62
Like my college training

222
00:17:52.66 --> 00:17:59.14
Qualified me to be an aircraft mechanic. It was a technical school part of a two-year thing and

223
00:18:02.58 --> 00:18:08.42
The Sacramento Air Depot was building up as a depot and

224
00:18:08.42 --> 00:18:13.82
And they were hiring anybody that said they could turn a wrench. I think

225
00:18:14.74 --> 00:18:16.74
They hired our whole class

226
00:18:17.62 --> 00:18:19.10
man

227
00:18:19.10 --> 00:18:21.66
This was after Pearl Harbor. They hired your whole class

228
00:18:22.38 --> 00:18:28.62
Right at graduation. Oh graduation graduation six months before got it pile Harbor

229
00:18:29.30 --> 00:18:31.58
And I can remember to this day

230
00:18:31.58 --> 00:18:37.98
well every guy if we're a war two guy knows where he was December 7th and

231
00:18:39.42 --> 00:18:41.82
We were working 24-7 and

232
00:18:42.94 --> 00:18:48.14
Being the kids young guys they put us on the graveyard shift

233
00:18:48.86 --> 00:18:51.30
and I just got none days and

234
00:18:54.10 --> 00:18:56.10
And I remember Sunday

235
00:18:56.10 --> 00:19:00.46
I came around later in the day and

236
00:19:02.98 --> 00:19:04.98
Said hey you you you

237
00:19:05.66 --> 00:19:10.30
Go home and come back at midnight. Jeff's just attacked us at Pearl Harbor

238
00:19:10.98 --> 00:19:13.50
God, I didn't even know where Pearl Harbor was

239
00:19:14.46 --> 00:19:17.62
But I knew the impact of that was

240
00:19:18.46 --> 00:19:20.46
Oh, we're at war and

241
00:19:22.62 --> 00:19:24.62
I was still

242
00:19:24.62 --> 00:19:26.62
19

243
00:19:27.14 --> 00:19:28.26
And

244
00:19:28.26 --> 00:19:30.82
So I had to wait one month. I

245
00:19:31.58 --> 00:19:35.58
Went down on my birthday and a few days later. I

246
00:19:36.74 --> 00:19:39.82
Raised my right hand and I was on my way

247
00:19:42.94 --> 00:19:47.86
You say in the book on the 13th of January my 20th birthday I went in to sign up

248
00:19:47.86 --> 00:19:50.10
They had a recruiting office right there on base

249
00:19:50.10 --> 00:19:54.54
They gave me a physical and I was so keyed up with anticipation that they gave me the

250
00:19:54.78 --> 00:19:59.54
Schneider test a blood pressure and pulse check the doctor said I was borderline there might be a problem

251
00:19:59.54 --> 00:20:03.86
My heart was pounding away like a jackhammer. I was told to come back in a couple days

252
00:20:03.86 --> 00:20:05.86
They test me again after I was accepted

253
00:20:05.86 --> 00:20:07.86
I couldn't wait to tell Lloyd

254
00:20:08.46 --> 00:20:12.30
Geraldson an older guy who'd been a pilot and done some barnstorming

255
00:20:12.50 --> 00:20:15.94
He worked at the depot and we often carpool together

256
00:20:15.94 --> 00:20:23.02
I looked up to him like to listen to him talk about flying. I told him the moment he got in the car and

257
00:20:23.42 --> 00:20:27.46
He leaned back against the passengers door and stared at me silently

258
00:20:28.06 --> 00:20:33.78
Son he said after a while. Let me tell you something. You've just signed your own death warrant

259
00:20:33.78 --> 00:20:41.86
That's a heavy statement. Yeah years later

260
00:20:48.02 --> 00:20:53.14
We talked about it years later and he said he doesn't remember saying that

261
00:20:55.46 --> 00:21:01.18
He was just throwing it out there it had a little impact on me, but not much

262
00:21:01.18 --> 00:21:03.18
Hmm

263
00:21:03.26 --> 00:21:07.98
So then you start flight training. Yeah, and it was all the flight training down in San Diego

264
00:21:08.66 --> 00:21:15.06
Just my primary. Okay, so you go down there and from the book it sounds like you you already knew how to fly

265
00:21:15.82 --> 00:21:22.62
So got a private pilots license. Did that make it just a lot easier than the other people were having I?

266
00:21:23.62 --> 00:21:25.62
Don't remember having any trouble

267
00:21:26.66 --> 00:21:28.66
Going through the military

268
00:21:28.66 --> 00:21:30.66
I

269
00:21:30.66 --> 00:21:32.66
I

270
00:21:32.66 --> 00:21:34.66
I

271
00:21:34.66 --> 00:21:36.66
I

272
00:21:36.66 --> 00:21:38.66
I

273
00:21:38.66 --> 00:21:40.66
I

274
00:21:40.66 --> 00:21:42.66
I

275
00:21:42.66 --> 00:21:44.66
I

276
00:21:44.66 --> 00:21:46.66
I

277
00:21:46.66 --> 00:21:48.66
I

278
00:21:48.66 --> 00:21:50.66
I

279
00:21:50.66 --> 00:21:52.66
I

280
00:21:52.66 --> 00:21:54.66
I

281
00:21:54.66 --> 00:21:56.66
I

282
00:21:56.66 --> 00:21:58.66
I

283
00:21:58.66 --> 00:22:00.66
I

284
00:22:00.66 --> 00:22:02.66
I

285
00:22:02.66 --> 00:22:04.66
I

286
00:22:04.66 --> 00:22:06.66
I

287
00:22:06.66 --> 00:22:08.66
I

288
00:22:08.66 --> 00:22:10.66
I

289
00:22:10.66 --> 00:22:12.66
I

290
00:22:12.66 --> 00:22:14.66
I

291
00:22:14.66 --> 00:22:16.66
I

292
00:22:16.66 --> 00:22:18.66
I

293
00:22:18.66 --> 00:22:20.66
I

294
00:22:20.66 --> 00:22:22.66
I

295
00:22:22.66 --> 00:22:24.66
I

296
00:22:24.66 --> 00:22:26.66
I don't think there was too much

297
00:22:26.66 --> 00:22:28.10
of that

298
00:22:28.10 --> 00:22:30.10
Tell you the truth

299
00:22:30.50 --> 00:22:33.86
It probably just pilot maybe yeah

300
00:22:34.82 --> 00:22:40.10
So you guys were busy creating the aura that guys like Dave Burke would get to live off of

301
00:22:42.90 --> 00:22:45.30
So you get your wings do you get your wings at the end of primary?

302
00:22:46.02 --> 00:22:49.22
No, you got to go through three flight schools

303
00:22:49.22 --> 00:22:54.10
Primary basic and advanced about three months along

304
00:22:55.30 --> 00:22:59.94
And do you know that you're going to be a fighter pilot? I mean because you could be a transport pilot

305
00:23:01.22 --> 00:23:04.50
How do you how do they figure out who's going to get to be a fighter pilot especially?

306
00:23:05.78 --> 00:23:07.78
At that time when I went in

307
00:23:08.82 --> 00:23:10.82
if you

308
00:23:11.14 --> 00:23:13.14
Knew what you wanted to do

309
00:23:14.26 --> 00:23:17.14
And I could convince your instructor

310
00:23:17.14 --> 00:23:19.14
That you'd be a good fighter pilot

311
00:23:20.02 --> 00:23:23.54
Your chances were pretty good of getting what you wanted

312
00:23:24.82 --> 00:23:27.78
We needed they were trying to build up

313
00:23:29.46 --> 00:23:31.46
From

314
00:23:32.26 --> 00:23:34.02
You know a few few

315
00:23:35.06 --> 00:23:37.06
Hundreds of pilots

316
00:23:38.10 --> 00:23:41.06
To 225,000 pilots

317
00:23:42.34 --> 00:23:45.78
And don't let safety get in the way of progress

318
00:23:45.78 --> 00:23:47.78
progress

319
00:23:47.94 --> 00:23:53.78
And I'd like to I don't think this is in my book, but uh a sad

320
00:23:56.18 --> 00:23:58.34
Statistic of world war two is

321
00:23:59.30 --> 00:24:03.38
We killed more of our own pilots in training

322
00:24:04.26 --> 00:24:06.26
Than we did in combat

323
00:24:06.50 --> 00:24:08.50
Wow

324
00:24:09.46 --> 00:24:10.42
Wow

325
00:24:10.42 --> 00:24:14.02
That's uh, that's definitely a crazy statistic especially

326
00:24:14.02 --> 00:24:17.14
Like the new generation like Dave the safety was number one

327
00:24:18.42 --> 00:24:20.42
100% right

328
00:24:20.42 --> 00:24:22.42
Yeah, I mean safety is a huge thing

329
00:24:23.06 --> 00:24:25.06
You did say something I wanted to ask about though

330
00:24:26.82 --> 00:24:31.62
Didn't everybody want to be a fighter pilot or are there guys that actually wanted to fly other airplanes?

331
00:24:32.66 --> 00:24:34.66
I think there was

332
00:24:35.38 --> 00:24:39.22
An equal number of wanted to fly multi engine

333
00:24:39.22 --> 00:24:41.22
Gotcha

334
00:24:41.22 --> 00:24:46.58
Um, and I don't know where my fighter pilot thing came from actually

335
00:24:47.78 --> 00:24:49.78
I think it was watching the

336
00:24:52.10 --> 00:24:54.98
Battle of britain newsreels

337
00:24:56.74 --> 00:24:58.98
You know wow and

338
00:25:01.22 --> 00:25:03.22
Then I thought you know

339
00:25:05.06 --> 00:25:07.94
If I'm a fighter pilot in a single place

340
00:25:08.82 --> 00:25:10.82
fighter

341
00:25:10.82 --> 00:25:13.14
I'm responsible for keeping me alive

342
00:25:14.10 --> 00:25:18.26
And I'd be the pilot the navigator the radio man the gunner

343
00:25:18.74 --> 00:25:19.78
the

344
00:25:19.78 --> 00:25:22.58
bomber bombardier all of those things

345
00:25:23.78 --> 00:25:26.82
And then I would not have to depend on 10 more

346
00:25:27.86 --> 00:25:29.38
10

347
00:25:29.38 --> 00:25:31.38
crews of 10

348
00:25:32.34 --> 00:25:35.62
And besides that I thought the fighters were a little bit cooler

349
00:25:35.62 --> 00:25:40.58
Well, I mean you want to talk about the building the aura of pilots

350
00:25:40.74 --> 00:25:45.78
I mean the battle of britain if you're watching that thing happen and you're seeing those spitfires and the

351
00:25:46.02 --> 00:25:56.66
Spitfires going out there and doing their work that had to at least start the momentum going for fighter pilots becoming what we now know as fighter pilots

352
00:25:59.46 --> 00:26:02.90
So once you do get trained you go you get sent to uh,

353
00:26:02.90 --> 00:26:08.50
San Francisco and you start flying a p39 for the 328th fighter group

354
00:26:09.06 --> 00:26:11.86
Correct, and you're flying coastal defense

355
00:26:14.18 --> 00:26:16.66
Well, I think that's just because we were there

356
00:26:18.02 --> 00:26:23.70
And we were flying military airplanes and they we didn't have any coastal defense

357
00:26:24.90 --> 00:26:29.22
And so you know you grabbed what you had and said okay you were part of it

358
00:26:29.22 --> 00:26:32.26
Yeah, it sounds like a job that

359
00:26:34.10 --> 00:26:36.58
Sounds like a job they kind of need something for you to do

360
00:26:38.10 --> 00:26:42.42
And they're not sure what although Dave you threw you flew combat air patrols over

361
00:26:43.14 --> 00:26:47.86
LA after september 11th, right? May our squadron right at right at starting on 9 11. We had a

362
00:26:48.66 --> 00:26:51.78
Mission starting that morning where we were flying missions up and down the coast

363
00:26:53.14 --> 00:26:56.34
Yeah, so that's uh kind of similar right

364
00:26:56.34 --> 00:26:59.78
I imagine it came from from not knowing what was going to happen next

365
00:26:59.94 --> 00:27:05.46
You know we had none of a clue. Yeah, and we we uh stayed up all night one time

366
00:27:06.34 --> 00:27:08.34
Because there was a report of a

367
00:27:09.46 --> 00:27:11.46
Japanese fleet

368
00:27:11.78 --> 00:27:13.78
You know coming toward the coast

369
00:27:14.66 --> 00:27:16.66
And it was it was ours

370
00:27:18.26 --> 00:27:20.26
They didn't tell anybody

371
00:27:21.14 --> 00:27:23.14
Well, that's not a good side

372
00:27:23.30 --> 00:27:25.30
You ended up losing your wingman

373
00:27:25.30 --> 00:27:27.30
In that time frame

374
00:27:27.70 --> 00:27:29.70
Is that right? Oh

375
00:27:30.58 --> 00:27:33.06
Yeah, I had a wingman. We were doing a

376
00:27:34.34 --> 00:27:38.66
You know he was a brand new and so he was just getting checked out

377
00:27:41.14 --> 00:27:42.82
And I

378
00:27:42.82 --> 00:27:47.86
Had him on my wing and I'm flying on here come a couple of navy planes

379
00:27:47.86 --> 00:27:54.42
And that wasn't uncommon. You know we had a lot of navy there in the Bay Area too

380
00:27:55.46 --> 00:27:59.30
And so it wasn't unusual that we would

381
00:28:02.02 --> 00:28:04.02
Attack each other and

382
00:28:05.22 --> 00:28:07.22
Have a little dog fight

383
00:28:07.94 --> 00:28:12.58
and the two navy planes came by and came across this and

384
00:28:14.02 --> 00:28:16.02
and

385
00:28:16.02 --> 00:28:18.02
I started heading down

386
00:28:18.90 --> 00:28:20.90
towards towards us

387
00:28:21.22 --> 00:28:23.14
and

388
00:28:23.14 --> 00:28:25.14
I was wagging my wings like

389
00:28:25.62 --> 00:28:28.42
Hey, wait a minute. Don't bother me now

390
00:28:29.62 --> 00:28:33.06
But that may have maybe waving my wings, but hey

391
00:28:34.66 --> 00:28:37.14
Let's have a dog fight. You know who knows

392
00:28:38.50 --> 00:28:40.10
and so

393
00:28:40.10 --> 00:28:42.10
I made a

394
00:28:42.18 --> 00:28:44.18
Pretty steep turn into them

395
00:28:44.18 --> 00:28:51.86
And my my new wingman just just maybe his second ride in the fighter

396
00:28:53.30 --> 00:28:55.30
Got in here and stalled the thing

397
00:28:56.50 --> 00:28:58.50
And I watched him

398
00:28:58.66 --> 00:29:00.66
Go into the bay

399
00:29:03.22 --> 00:29:04.90
Yeah, um

400
00:29:04.90 --> 00:29:07.14
Reflecting on that in the book you say

401
00:29:08.10 --> 00:29:12.10
Dying was easy a piece of cake lots of people would die

402
00:29:12.10 --> 00:29:16.58
And I and so I suppose I began putting up walls

403
00:29:17.46 --> 00:29:22.02
I knew I had to concentrate on what I was doing and block out the rest

404
00:29:22.74 --> 00:29:27.30
Jager wrote about that in his book how he stayed away from people didn't want to get close

405
00:29:28.10 --> 00:29:32.82
I don't know that I consciously carried it to that extreme, but it came out the same

406
00:29:33.62 --> 00:29:40.90
If you fly airplanes drive race cars do stunts for movies or maybe walk a high wire with the flying willendas

407
00:29:40.90 --> 00:29:42.90
Anything truly hazardous

408
00:29:43.46 --> 00:29:45.46
Then losing friends goes with the territory

409
00:29:46.18 --> 00:29:49.86
We're talking serious stress here and you either cope or you don't

410
00:29:50.82 --> 00:29:55.38
Death is a thing that you have to get used to as cruel and hard as it sounds

411
00:29:56.42 --> 00:30:03.54
From that point on from that point on I resolved to control my emotions no matter how hard that might be

412
00:30:06.26 --> 00:30:08.26
And you got some other

413
00:30:08.26 --> 00:30:10.26
Um

414
00:30:10.50 --> 00:30:12.50
Some other things that you talk about

415
00:30:13.06 --> 00:30:15.06
Just about being a good fighter pilot

416
00:30:15.70 --> 00:30:18.50
Uh, you because you're you know, you're mentioning that you got to control your emotions

417
00:30:18.50 --> 00:30:23.94
You also say a fighter pilot mentality was taking firm route now living close to the edge

418
00:30:24.74 --> 00:30:26.74
Sort of went with the job

419
00:30:26.74 --> 00:30:29.54
Daring audacity creativity flare

420
00:30:29.94 --> 00:30:31.94
These things were as much a part of being a

421
00:30:31.94 --> 00:30:38.26
Good fighter pilots makeup as skill and sound judgment and were encouraged within certain parameters

422
00:30:39.22 --> 00:30:44.58
Sometimes of course we stretch those a little the rest of the time more than a little

423
00:30:46.26 --> 00:30:49.86
You measured a pilot by his formation flying as much as by dog fighting

424
00:30:49.86 --> 00:30:56.74
Some guys would weave in and out just couldn't hold it there and some the talented ones could stick to your wing like paint

425
00:30:56.74 --> 00:31:01.46
You'd bank and go down and the good ones would stay right there no closer no farther away

426
00:31:02.18 --> 00:31:05.62
This was wartime however, and there was the other kind too

427
00:31:06.02 --> 00:31:12.18
We needed pilots so there was reluctance to wash people out and even more so once they'd gotten their wings

428
00:31:12.74 --> 00:31:19.62
marginal pilots slipped through not many and almost no truly bad ones at least not in fighters

429
00:31:20.82 --> 00:31:24.10
But there were pilots that made you uncomfortable wingtip to wingtip

430
00:31:24.10 --> 00:31:29.38
Chuck Jaeger was in the first group of pilots that joined us at tonapah

431
00:31:30.10 --> 00:31:34.42
We had only six months more experience than the guys straight out of flying school

432
00:31:34.42 --> 00:31:39.22
But that was a lot we knew how to fly p 39s the new guys hadn't seen one

433
00:31:39.22 --> 00:31:42.90
Some found the transition tricky at first but not Jaeger

434
00:31:42.90 --> 00:31:48.66
Chuck became the first the yardstick by which we would measure the rest as they joined us several each month

435
00:31:49.22 --> 00:31:52.82
Jaeger could fly right from the start. He was pretty impressive

436
00:31:52.82 --> 00:31:58.18
Jaeger and Chuck McGee had been flying sergeants graduates of a program for non commissioned officers

437
00:31:58.98 --> 00:32:04.02
Then someone decided pilots had to be officers. So they made up a rank flight officer

438
00:32:04.02 --> 00:32:07.86
equivalent to a warren officer one grade below second lieutenant

439
00:32:07.86 --> 00:32:13.14
So these guys were unusual what we called blue bars after the color of their insignia

440
00:32:13.54 --> 00:32:16.18
The two lowest ranking pilots in the squadron

441
00:32:16.50 --> 00:32:19.46
He was from West Virginia and had a terrible draw

442
00:32:19.46 --> 00:32:22.58
Over the years I got the impression that he loved to use it

443
00:32:22.58 --> 00:32:25.54
Never tried to hide it practiced it for all I knew

444
00:32:26.42 --> 00:32:29.94
He had such a distinctive voice you had no trouble picking him out on the radio

445
00:32:29.94 --> 00:32:32.26
And he had those eyes hunter's eyes

446
00:32:32.26 --> 00:32:37.30
Most of the aces could pick up far off airplanes a little quicker than the rest of the men

447
00:32:37.54 --> 00:32:42.66
But as often as not it was Jaeger spotting the enemy first and announcing it over the radio

448
00:32:42.66 --> 00:32:45.22
Making it sound like the Grand Old Opry

449
00:32:45.22 --> 00:32:49.22
When it wasn't him calling them out it was usually me

450
00:32:51.14 --> 00:32:55.86
So that's a big deal to have the eagle eyes that you guys had

451
00:32:55.86 --> 00:33:01.22
Yeah it really was when you think about it we didn't have any kind of a

452
00:33:04.18 --> 00:33:09.78
Ground control you know toward you know many bandits at 12 o'clock

453
00:33:09.78 --> 00:33:13.22
You had to see him

454
00:33:16.34 --> 00:33:20.98
It was an incredibly important in combat

455
00:33:21.70 --> 00:33:23.70
Dave you got good eyes don't you?

456
00:33:23.70 --> 00:33:27.94
I was uh I was given the gift of of really good vision and so

457
00:33:27.94 --> 00:33:31.70
But it's not as important now no because you just get basically in a modern

458
00:33:31.94 --> 00:33:34.42
You just got to be able to see the screens in front of your face, right?

459
00:33:35.30 --> 00:33:36.26
Thanks

460
00:33:36.26 --> 00:33:37.46
It's

461
00:33:37.46 --> 00:33:40.26
I would not draw a comparison of what what Colonel Anderson

462
00:33:41.14 --> 00:33:44.98
Needed in terms of the vision but having good eyesight even today

463
00:33:45.78 --> 00:33:50.50
Is a huge advantage because at some point all the computers all the information

464
00:33:51.06 --> 00:33:54.26
You were talking about even someone on the ground telling you where to go and where to look

465
00:33:54.98 --> 00:33:56.98
Eventually you have to see him yourself

466
00:33:57.70 --> 00:34:02.42
And the sooner you see him the better and the better your eyes are the sooner you see him. So

467
00:34:03.06 --> 00:34:04.02
For me

468
00:34:04.02 --> 00:34:06.02
50 years later to me

469
00:34:06.02 --> 00:34:12.90
50 years later listened you describe a fighter pilot daring creative stretching limits

470
00:34:14.18 --> 00:34:17.06
It's the exact same way we think about it 50 years later

471
00:34:17.06 --> 00:34:23.54
So your explanation is is timeless for what a good fighter pilot makes so it was really cool to read that and hear that from you

472
00:34:25.78 --> 00:34:28.90
Now you get trained up and eventually you get orders to europe

473
00:34:29.54 --> 00:34:33.62
You get orders to europe and again to fast forward a little bit through the story here

474
00:34:33.62 --> 00:34:36.26
And people got to get the book to get the all the details

475
00:34:36.74 --> 00:34:38.74
But you guys ride over

476
00:34:38.74 --> 00:34:41.06
To england on on the queen elizabeth

477
00:34:41.70 --> 00:34:42.42
right

478
00:34:42.42 --> 00:34:47.22
So but I it's not exactly the luxury liner that you wanted it to be right

479
00:34:47.86 --> 00:34:50.02
They'd pack you in there with what 17 000 guys

480
00:34:51.70 --> 00:34:53.70
Yeah, it was something like that

481
00:34:54.66 --> 00:34:56.74
A division

482
00:34:56.74 --> 00:34:58.74
infantry division

483
00:34:58.74 --> 00:35:05.14
Plus the fighter group and yeah, I did something like that. Yeah, it's a big number

484
00:35:05.86 --> 00:35:12.18
The air conditioning I assume wasn't great on that on that ride over. Well, it was for our gis

485
00:35:12.90 --> 00:35:14.90
They had to ride

486
00:35:14.90 --> 00:35:19.30
24 hours on that open deck. They had plenty of air conditioning

487
00:35:20.66 --> 00:35:22.66
and then 25

488
00:35:22.82 --> 00:35:24.82
24 hours in the hole

489
00:35:25.30 --> 00:35:27.30
Yeah, but I was a captain

490
00:35:27.30 --> 00:35:30.50
So I got a honeymoon suite on the

491
00:35:32.10 --> 00:35:36.10
Fourth floor nice with 17 other guys

492
00:35:39.78 --> 00:35:45.46
Uh, and you had to be were you thinking all about like you boats like getting oh my gosh, yeah

493
00:35:46.42 --> 00:35:49.70
We had not won the battle before the Atlantic yet

494
00:35:50.42 --> 00:35:52.42
and we were taking

495
00:35:53.46 --> 00:35:55.46
Pretty good losses

496
00:35:55.46 --> 00:36:01.62
Yeah, and I figured that the queen mary and the queen elizabeth had to be primary targets

497
00:36:02.42 --> 00:36:06.82
You know that there was to be a ring of them out there off of new york

498
00:36:08.10 --> 00:36:10.42
And which we'd have to go through

499
00:36:11.86 --> 00:36:15.46
But you know, they did that the whole war and

500
00:36:16.90 --> 00:36:20.26
ours, I'm no were never damaged or anything

501
00:36:21.38 --> 00:36:23.38
They were fast

502
00:36:23.38 --> 00:36:25.38
And

503
00:36:25.46 --> 00:36:30.50
They'd change course, you know every so often

504
00:36:32.42 --> 00:36:36.98
They would take alternative routes instead of going directly across

505
00:36:37.22 --> 00:36:42.50
I remember we went down by the azores on our trip to the anglin

506
00:36:44.02 --> 00:36:46.02
and so

507
00:36:47.62 --> 00:36:49.78
Yeah thinking thinking

508
00:36:49.78 --> 00:36:55.78
About you boats was was very high on my list

509
00:36:56.74 --> 00:36:58.74
Yeah, that's gotta be scary

510
00:36:58.74 --> 00:37:03.78
And you know, they didn't have enough lifeboats for 10 or 15,000 people on that

511
00:37:03.78 --> 00:37:09.78
Oh my god, I don't know whether they did or not, but we had lifeboat drills all the time

512
00:37:09.78 --> 00:37:11.78
Wow

513
00:37:11.78 --> 00:37:15.78
Uh, you end up arriving in england

514
00:37:15.78 --> 00:37:18.82
December 4th 1943

515
00:37:18.82 --> 00:37:20.82
And

516
00:37:20.82 --> 00:37:23.46
I'm gonna get into a little section here

517
00:37:24.90 --> 00:37:28.58
You say I don't remember when or how I learned about jack

518
00:37:29.94 --> 00:37:34.18
He'd been shot down over germany on november 13th and was listed as missing

519
00:37:34.82 --> 00:37:36.82
But I don't remember how I found out

520
00:37:37.30 --> 00:37:41.30
It seems clear I had a note from my sister, but I have no memory of it

521
00:37:41.94 --> 00:37:43.94
I don't recall what my emotions were

522
00:37:44.50 --> 00:37:46.98
Though in thinking this book through I've tried

523
00:37:46.98 --> 00:37:52.02
I'm certain I wrote a letter about it to elinor saying how terribly sorry I was

524
00:37:52.90 --> 00:37:55.78
But I have no memory of what the letter contained exactly

525
00:37:57.06 --> 00:37:59.30
And and elinor was was jack's wife

526
00:38:00.34 --> 00:38:02.34
Like most men who've known combat

527
00:38:02.82 --> 00:38:09.38
I can remember the finest detail the nuances what airplanes look like in my gun sights what I felt in the swirl of battle

528
00:38:09.78 --> 00:38:14.50
What I said to people and what they said to me on certain days 40 odd years ago

529
00:38:14.50 --> 00:38:22.50
I can remember silly things the words to some glenn miller tunes the first points I ever scored in a basketball game

530
00:38:22.74 --> 00:38:26.10
These things are burned into me. I can summon them up in an instant

531
00:38:27.14 --> 00:38:32.82
But as for things in my heart on the day I found out my best friend had been shot down and possibly killed

532
00:38:33.22 --> 00:38:35.22
No clue remains

533
00:38:35.62 --> 00:38:37.62
All of that is blocked out

534
00:38:38.18 --> 00:38:40.18
The screen is blank

535
00:38:40.18 --> 00:38:46.18
Before anyone thought up computers or knew what delete buttons were I had one and I punched it

536
00:38:47.78 --> 00:38:49.78
That was how we all managed

537
00:38:50.82 --> 00:38:54.98
On December 12th, I wrote my parents. I received june's letter

538
00:38:55.46 --> 00:39:00.26
Although it had been bad news about jack. It still was swell to get my first mail here

539
00:39:00.90 --> 00:39:04.10
I can imagine how you can imagine how I feel about it

540
00:39:05.06 --> 00:39:07.54
But as long as he is just reported missing

541
00:39:07.54 --> 00:39:09.54
I won't worry about him

542
00:39:11.38 --> 00:39:17.54
Much later we would learn he'd survived the bailout from his p-38, but it died in hospital

543
00:39:18.74 --> 00:39:24.02
Jack stacker is buried in belgium in one of those sprawling white on green military cemeteries

544
00:39:24.58 --> 00:39:28.90
That we americans maintain so meticulously the cross is all in row

545
00:39:30.02 --> 00:39:34.02
He was married two weeks before he went off to war and then never came home

546
00:39:34.02 --> 00:39:39.86
Like 291,130 other american boys in that war

547
00:39:41.70 --> 00:39:43.70
It was just his fourth mission

548
00:39:49.14 --> 00:39:54.98
So this I mean this is jack the boy that you grew up with the boy that you were obsessed with airplanes with

549
00:39:55.46 --> 00:39:58.18
The kid that you both wanted to go and fly

550
00:39:58.18 --> 00:40:04.74
And here you are basically almost as soon as you arrive in england you find out that

551
00:40:05.78 --> 00:40:07.78
That he's been shot down

552
00:40:08.98 --> 00:40:10.98
Yeah, yes

553
00:40:16.42 --> 00:40:19.46
I don't know what else I can say other than what you just read

554
00:40:19.46 --> 00:40:25.78
Um, it was a blow to me

555
00:40:27.62 --> 00:40:29.62
But then it

556
00:40:30.02 --> 00:40:32.90
We knew he was in the hospital we learned that

557
00:40:34.26 --> 00:40:36.82
And so he had to been alive

558
00:40:38.66 --> 00:40:44.26
So there was some hope, you know, you know, drag along and on and on and then you find out he's killed

559
00:40:44.98 --> 00:40:47.22
it's uh

560
00:40:47.22 --> 00:40:54.10
Maybe a easy way to break him on it, but it's still a blow no matter how you slice it

561
00:40:57.46 --> 00:41:00.74
Meanwhile you guys get issued the first

562
00:41:02.26 --> 00:41:04.82
P-51s that are going to enter the war

563
00:41:06.42 --> 00:41:08.18
And

564
00:41:08.18 --> 00:41:12.02
Tell me about that p-51 the first time you got to fire that thing up

565
00:41:12.02 --> 00:41:18.42
Well, I'm going to go back further than that when we got the word

566
00:41:19.86 --> 00:41:25.54
I don't think any of us had even seen a Mustang let alone fly one

567
00:41:27.22 --> 00:41:30.10
And then after we got to fly or fly him

568
00:41:31.62 --> 00:41:33.22
Uh

569
00:41:33.22 --> 00:41:35.22
It was kind of a

570
00:41:35.54 --> 00:41:37.54
Do-it-yourself checkout

571
00:41:37.70 --> 00:41:39.70
Uh

572
00:41:39.70 --> 00:41:43.86
We would send a guy up to the port where they were assembled

573
00:41:45.46 --> 00:41:47.46
Find a crew chief

574
00:41:47.70 --> 00:41:49.70
Learn how to start it

575
00:41:50.10 --> 00:41:52.66
And bring it back and check out the next guy

576
00:41:54.42 --> 00:41:56.42
And uh

577
00:41:57.54 --> 00:42:00.90
I can hear again. I'm I'm one of these lucky guys

578
00:42:02.66 --> 00:42:07.30
About this time a group commander came by and says hey, but we're gonna

579
00:42:07.30 --> 00:42:09.30
Uh

580
00:42:09.30 --> 00:42:11.30
They call me Andy actually

581
00:42:14.02 --> 00:42:16.02
You're gonna go to the

582
00:42:17.14 --> 00:42:19.14
Royal Air Force central

583
00:42:19.86 --> 00:42:23.14
flight instructor school gunnery instructor

584
00:42:25.22 --> 00:42:26.90
And uh

585
00:42:26.90 --> 00:42:33.38
Take a p-51 and fly the course with a p-51 instead of

586
00:42:34.10 --> 00:42:35.94
a spitfire

587
00:42:35.94 --> 00:42:37.94
Which is what the course

588
00:42:38.82 --> 00:42:40.82
was taught in

589
00:42:41.14 --> 00:42:45.62
So that gave me 35 hours in the Mustang before combat

590
00:42:46.74 --> 00:42:48.74
Where other guys were lucky to get

591
00:42:50.66 --> 00:42:52.74
Uh two or three flights

592
00:42:54.42 --> 00:42:56.42
Uh

593
00:42:56.66 --> 00:42:58.66
I make that sound

594
00:42:59.86 --> 00:43:01.86
You know really bad but

595
00:43:01.86 --> 00:43:09.94
It was so much better than the p-39 and we knew it and boy we weren't gonna bitch

596
00:43:12.58 --> 00:43:17.38
But the bad thing about it was the handbooks didn't even come with the airplane

597
00:43:19.30 --> 00:43:21.86
And so we're we're making it up

598
00:43:23.70 --> 00:43:25.14
And

599
00:43:25.14 --> 00:43:30.58
And it didn't have to be that way because the pioneer Mustang group was already in

600
00:43:30.58 --> 00:43:32.58
The theater checked out

601
00:43:34.90 --> 00:43:41.46
But they just didn't have a way of passing the word to you guys well, I don't know why though

602
00:43:43.38 --> 00:43:45.62
Dave what do you want to know about the p-51 Mustang?

603
00:43:46.66 --> 00:43:50.34
I'm trying to imagine that feeling of of and I think you described it

604
00:43:50.90 --> 00:43:54.58
They didn't quote tell you where you were gonna go, but you knew where you were going

605
00:43:54.82 --> 00:43:57.22
Oh, yeah, but you left your p-39s behind

606
00:43:57.22 --> 00:44:04.02
Yes, so did you know did you have a thought that they were going to be p-51s there or was that a surprise when you found out?

607
00:44:04.50 --> 00:44:06.50
well

608
00:44:07.62 --> 00:44:09.62
When when I

609
00:44:11.78 --> 00:44:13.78
Looking back at it

610
00:44:19.70 --> 00:44:23.94
We wondered where we would go, you know with p-39s

611
00:44:23.94 --> 00:44:25.94
And

612
00:44:26.50 --> 00:44:28.50
be in North Africa or

613
00:44:29.94 --> 00:44:31.94
South Pacific where they were

614
00:44:33.14 --> 00:44:35.14
being used

615
00:44:36.02 --> 00:44:38.02
And so

616
00:44:39.70 --> 00:44:46.26
We heard at the same time we're going to go to England and we're getting the brand new p-51 Bravo

617
00:44:48.66 --> 00:44:51.62
So that one was a surprise but

618
00:44:51.62 --> 00:44:53.62
When we got there

619
00:44:54.74 --> 00:45:00.34
Not having airplanes there waiting for us was a little bit of a surprise

620
00:45:01.62 --> 00:45:08.98
And so then that's when we learned that oh, we're gonna go to the port and bring bring your own airplane home

621
00:45:09.14 --> 00:45:11.14
Oh, Jesus

622
00:45:11.14 --> 00:45:19.14
Uh, and we thought we thought once we flew the airplane

623
00:45:19.94 --> 00:45:22.26
Boy, we didn't bitch about a thing

624
00:45:23.14 --> 00:45:26.58
It was so much better than the p-39

625
00:45:28.02 --> 00:45:33.78
You know, we didn't want to get bitch bitch too much said okay guys you can go to african

626
00:45:34.42 --> 00:45:36.42
fly your old p-39

627
00:45:37.70 --> 00:45:39.70
We love that Mustang

628
00:45:39.70 --> 00:45:44.02
Ah, it was it was a great airplane and it was

629
00:45:46.34 --> 00:45:48.34
It it

630
00:45:49.14 --> 00:45:52.58
It was a perfect airplane for the european theater

631
00:45:53.54 --> 00:45:56.18
It had such long range and endurance

632
00:45:57.22 --> 00:45:59.22
highly maneuverable

633
00:46:00.10 --> 00:46:02.10
and

634
00:46:02.10 --> 00:46:09.70
Just no negative things people said oh well it was liquid cool and one bullet hole in there would

635
00:46:10.66 --> 00:46:15.38
ruin your whole day. Well, we didn't have many of those believe it or not

636
00:46:16.90 --> 00:46:18.90
and so even that didn't

637
00:46:19.54 --> 00:46:21.54
turn out to be a

638
00:46:21.78 --> 00:46:23.78
You know a big negative factor

639
00:46:25.06 --> 00:46:26.90
And I gotta say

640
00:46:26.90 --> 00:46:32.26
A thing or two here that might cannot come out clear in my book

641
00:46:35.38 --> 00:46:38.34
They arrived with a Mustang in europe

642
00:46:40.42 --> 00:46:45.06
And jimmy do little taken over the eighth air force

643
00:46:46.34 --> 00:46:54.02
Made a significant impact on the air war in europe and the eventual downfall of germany

644
00:46:54.02 --> 00:46:59.46
What was the what was what was the correlation there? Okay, let's see

645
00:47:02.82 --> 00:47:04.82
In late 43

646
00:47:05.94 --> 00:47:07.94
The eighth air force

647
00:47:08.10 --> 00:47:11.22
But their b-17s b-24s

648
00:47:13.62 --> 00:47:17.70
Had a bombing halt they stopped doing what they were doing

649
00:47:17.70 --> 00:47:24.34
And they're making you know they were supposed to kill the luft waf so we could have the invasion

650
00:47:26.02 --> 00:47:28.02
of of europe

651
00:47:28.50 --> 00:47:30.50
And you can't go without it

652
00:47:31.06 --> 00:47:33.06
you got to kill the

653
00:47:34.02 --> 00:47:36.02
enemies air

654
00:47:36.98 --> 00:47:38.74
and

655
00:47:38.74 --> 00:47:45.46
The way they were trying to do it was uh, they thought they could do it alone. They thought they could go without

656
00:47:45.46 --> 00:47:46.58
it

657
00:47:46.58 --> 00:47:48.58
fighter escort or anybody

658
00:47:50.58 --> 00:47:56.74
And they forgot to tell the luft waf of about it and they were having tremendous losses

659
00:47:58.10 --> 00:47:59.94
So they have a

660
00:47:59.94 --> 00:48:03.86
Bombing halt and said okay. We've got to have escort we

661
00:48:05.22 --> 00:48:10.98
And they said oh by the way then pioneer Mustang group is over here in europe

662
00:48:10.98 --> 00:48:18.74
In the ninth air force which was a tactical air force that was going to go with the invasion

663
00:48:20.10 --> 00:48:24.34
And they put the pioneer Mustang was signed to it the ninth air force

664
00:48:26.26 --> 00:48:32.90
Said we understand they have pretty good range and everything. Why don't we try them so they've blown the uh

665
00:48:34.34 --> 00:48:36.34
through 54th fighter group the

666
00:48:36.34 --> 00:48:39.70
uh pioneer group to the

667
00:48:40.98 --> 00:48:44.26
8th air force and they were so wildly successful

668
00:48:45.22 --> 00:48:48.82
That they air for 8th air force demanded that they get

669
00:48:49.46 --> 00:48:51.30
p-51s

670
00:48:51.30 --> 00:48:53.30
We're the next one coming

671
00:48:53.70 --> 00:48:55.54
so we go

672
00:48:55.54 --> 00:49:01.78
Almost directly to the 8th air force. We were we were assigned to the ninth for a short time

673
00:49:03.46 --> 00:49:05.30
and uh

674
00:49:05.30 --> 00:49:07.30
When we got our airplanes

675
00:49:08.58 --> 00:49:10.42
well then

676
00:49:10.42 --> 00:49:12.42
tactics

677
00:49:12.98 --> 00:49:15.14
The 8th air force was in charge

678
00:49:16.10 --> 00:49:18.10
and the 8th fighter command

679
00:49:18.74 --> 00:49:20.74
Told us how to escort

680
00:49:22.10 --> 00:49:25.78
They said we want to see you we want you close

681
00:49:25.78 --> 00:49:33.70
Uh when the enemy comes in we want just to drive it away and

682
00:49:36.58 --> 00:49:39.54
When just drive them away and then come back

683
00:49:41.70 --> 00:49:46.90
You know is this this being videoed? Yes, it is people people to be able to watch your hands

684
00:49:48.26 --> 00:49:52.42
Fighter pilots can't tell their story without using their hands

685
00:49:52.42 --> 00:49:58.50
It's impossible if I had to put my hands down here. I couldn't tell you we would just stop recording

686
00:50:00.26 --> 00:50:04.10
No, we can see you and they can see you and so uh

687
00:50:05.62 --> 00:50:08.02
So their tactic was just we actually had uh

688
00:50:09.38 --> 00:50:15.54
An altitude limit we we could take them to 18 000 feet if you haven't shot him down

689
00:50:16.42 --> 00:50:18.42
Break it off come back up

690
00:50:18.42 --> 00:50:21.86
It wasn't the way to do it as it turned out

691
00:50:22.58 --> 00:50:24.58
But we do what we're told

692
00:50:26.74 --> 00:50:29.14
And further they were um

693
00:50:30.34 --> 00:50:32.34
their ideas of um

694
00:50:33.78 --> 00:50:39.54
Oh, they have all the strategic air command was you know was their basic

695
00:50:41.14 --> 00:50:44.10
Uh thinking that the bombers could go in

696
00:50:44.10 --> 00:50:50.82
And didn't need help they could destroy the enemy's war making capability

697
00:50:51.62 --> 00:50:53.62
And the troops could just walk in

698
00:50:54.90 --> 00:50:57.94
Well, like I said, they didn't tell the Luftwaffe about it

699
00:50:59.70 --> 00:51:01.70
So um

700
00:51:02.42 --> 00:51:08.18
They were even so upset. Oh, they were bombing factories oil

701
00:51:08.18 --> 00:51:17.06
Anything to do with a production of fighters or just fighters on the ground, you know inventory

702
00:51:20.34 --> 00:51:22.34
So uh

703
00:51:22.90 --> 00:51:27.06
The the chief of staff was so upset about it. He uh

704
00:51:28.34 --> 00:51:30.34
Had given them several

705
00:51:31.54 --> 00:51:33.54
Written instructions

706
00:51:33.54 --> 00:51:36.66
You got to kill the

707
00:51:38.34 --> 00:51:40.34
Luftwaffe

708
00:51:40.74 --> 00:51:42.74
And they just weren't doing it

709
00:51:43.30 --> 00:51:45.94
So they fired the 8th Air Force commander

710
00:51:47.38 --> 00:51:49.38
And brought in Jimmy Doolittle

711
00:51:50.98 --> 00:51:53.94
Who had a personal talk with the chief of staff

712
00:51:54.90 --> 00:51:57.14
And he said Jimmy Doolittle

713
00:51:58.02 --> 00:52:01.06
The mission is to destroy the Luftwaffe

714
00:52:01.06 --> 00:52:03.06
I don't care how you do it

715
00:52:04.66 --> 00:52:06.66
And so

716
00:52:06.74 --> 00:52:10.98
He was well, you guys all know who he is and what

717
00:52:11.70 --> 00:52:13.70
Things he'd done

718
00:52:13.70 --> 00:52:18.58
Doolittle read shortly after Pearl Harbor, you know incredible stuff

719
00:52:18.98 --> 00:52:20.98
Blind flying

720
00:52:21.78 --> 00:52:23.78
And uh

721
00:52:23.78 --> 00:52:26.82
So he was more primal and uh

722
00:52:28.42 --> 00:52:30.42
He uh

723
00:52:30.42 --> 00:52:37.78
He came down to I didn't know this I read it in his book later

724
00:52:38.90 --> 00:52:42.90
He came down to visit the 8th fighter command headquarters

725
00:52:44.98 --> 00:52:46.98
I went you know

726
00:52:47.06 --> 00:52:49.06
first time

727
00:52:49.38 --> 00:52:52.58
And they walked through and they had this single visit door

728
00:52:54.02 --> 00:52:58.98
The mission of the 8th fighter command is to bring the bombers home safely

729
00:52:58.98 --> 00:53:00.98
Something like that

730
00:53:00.98 --> 00:53:02.98
He said

731
00:53:03.62 --> 00:53:06.26
Who put that who put that up there?

732
00:53:07.94 --> 00:53:12.18
And general Kepner said I don't know it was here when I got here

733
00:53:13.30 --> 00:53:15.30
And he says well tear it down

734
00:53:16.26 --> 00:53:18.82
The mission of the 8th fighter command

735
00:53:20.50 --> 00:53:23.14
Is to destroy the Luftwaffe

736
00:53:24.50 --> 00:53:26.50
No more 18,000 feet

737
00:53:26.50 --> 00:53:31.62
Now it was pursuing destroy that was of official

738
00:53:32.98 --> 00:53:37.06
Our orders were now you fighters you're turned loose

739
00:53:40.90 --> 00:53:48.10
And you know we had felt like we were my first month I guess I was old there was under those

740
00:53:48.74 --> 00:53:50.58
restrictions

741
00:53:50.58 --> 00:53:58.50
And we did have the feeling that you were tight you know you had your hands by we wanted to get into the fight

742
00:53:59.06 --> 00:54:00.50
We just

743
00:54:00.50 --> 00:54:02.50
Were also eager

744
00:54:03.78 --> 00:54:05.62
It was incredible

745
00:54:05.62 --> 00:54:09.22
And what that happened he turned that the energy loose

746
00:54:10.82 --> 00:54:12.82
And that's actually

747
00:54:12.98 --> 00:54:15.30
How we defeated the Luftwaffe

748
00:54:15.30 --> 00:54:20.18
We shot down their experience test pilots one by one

749
00:54:21.46 --> 00:54:24.34
And by spring

750
00:54:25.46 --> 00:54:27.94
Oh no that's the spring of 41

751
00:54:29.94 --> 00:54:31.94
41 yeah

752
00:54:31.94 --> 00:54:33.94
And

753
00:54:33.94 --> 00:54:35.94
The invasion was

754
00:54:36.34 --> 00:54:38.34
Was planned for

755
00:54:38.34 --> 00:54:40.34
6th June

756
00:54:40.34 --> 00:54:42.34
And

757
00:54:42.34 --> 00:54:46.82
So by the you know by May

758
00:54:49.06 --> 00:54:51.86
The Germans could not put up a mass

759
00:54:53.46 --> 00:54:55.14
Against us

760
00:54:55.14 --> 00:54:57.14
Well, we were we were putting up

761
00:54:57.70 --> 00:54:59.70
thousand bombers

762
00:54:59.70 --> 00:55:00.82
and

763
00:55:00.82 --> 00:55:08.26
Eight nine hundred fighters maybe you know that would be the maximum we go we get those kind of missions

764
00:55:09.70 --> 00:55:11.38
and

765
00:55:11.38 --> 00:55:13.62
When we were trying to do it the beginning

766
00:55:18.26 --> 00:55:22.34
The Germans would put up a big a big fuss about it

767
00:55:23.62 --> 00:55:25.62
I mean hundreds of airplanes

768
00:55:26.26 --> 00:55:27.78
and

769
00:55:27.78 --> 00:55:29.78
By they by May

770
00:55:30.34 --> 00:55:32.34
They could not do that anymore

771
00:55:33.30 --> 00:55:35.30
And that allowed the

772
00:55:37.22 --> 00:55:39.22
Invasion to start

773
00:55:39.22 --> 00:55:41.22
And led to the eventual

774
00:55:42.18 --> 00:55:44.18
downfall of

775
00:55:44.90 --> 00:55:46.90
Of Germany

776
00:55:46.98 --> 00:55:49.62
And I credit general do little

777
00:55:52.10 --> 00:55:54.10
Turning the fighter pilots loose

778
00:55:54.82 --> 00:55:56.82
his policies

779
00:55:57.06 --> 00:56:02.10
And they were able to the Mustang of having a significant impact

780
00:56:02.82 --> 00:56:04.82
on the war in Europe

781
00:56:05.14 --> 00:56:06.74
when you guys

782
00:56:06.74 --> 00:56:11.46
Took the Mustang out when you're flying it how much intel did you have

783
00:56:12.02 --> 00:56:15.54
About the enemy fighters. Did you know when you got that

784
00:56:15.86 --> 00:56:19.94
Mustang up going as fast as it could go. Did you think to yourself or did you know?

785
00:56:20.42 --> 00:56:24.66
Hey, the mischishment can only go this fast the Junker can only go that fast

786
00:56:25.06 --> 00:56:26.90
Did you did you you know nowadays?

787
00:56:26.90 --> 00:56:32.82
We kind of analyze maybe even over analyze the enemy, but we have pretty good intelligence about what their capabilities are

788
00:56:32.82 --> 00:56:37.78
When you got that Mustang did you pretty quickly realize you were going to have the upper hand?

789
00:56:38.90 --> 00:56:43.06
Pretty pretty soon. I felt I felt like I learned it real quick

790
00:56:46.18 --> 00:56:51.86
Uh, especially in altitude I learned later that um

791
00:56:53.78 --> 00:56:57.94
A measure smith in the hands of a good pilot down low

792
00:56:58.90 --> 00:57:00.90
Could give a Mustang a hard time

793
00:57:00.90 --> 00:57:04.18
Mm-hmm, but I never experienced that

794
00:57:07.30 --> 00:57:14.34
Fortunately, I guess I'd like to say a little bit about the Pacific of the

795
00:57:19.30 --> 00:57:21.30
European theater

796
00:57:22.58 --> 00:57:26.58
The airplanes in the in the European war

797
00:57:26.58 --> 00:57:31.22
We're all very close in performance

798
00:57:32.90 --> 00:57:34.90
109 190

799
00:57:36.58 --> 00:57:44.26
Uh, not the the twin engine ones. You could just forget them first guy there got the most

800
00:57:44.26 --> 00:57:48.26
Um

801
00:57:54.26 --> 00:58:00.50
Oh so compared to the zero, you know where you had to we had we had and

802
00:58:02.18 --> 00:58:04.98
We're faster and could climb higher and they were

803
00:58:05.62 --> 00:58:08.90
But don't turn with a zero, you know, it's what I

804
00:58:09.70 --> 00:58:11.70
get I never had to but I

805
00:58:11.94 --> 00:58:13.54
that's when I

806
00:58:13.54 --> 00:58:15.54
heard

807
00:58:15.62 --> 00:58:17.62
intelligence

808
00:58:17.86 --> 00:58:19.86
Reports

809
00:58:21.38 --> 00:58:24.10
Therefore I'd say in Europe

810
00:58:25.70 --> 00:58:28.42
The pilots made a lot of difference

811
00:58:29.54 --> 00:58:31.54
Whereas not so much in the

812
00:58:32.50 --> 00:58:34.34
Japanese theater

813
00:58:34.34 --> 00:58:39.38
You you you had to use tactics, you know, don't dogfight

814
00:58:39.38 --> 00:58:41.38
So

815
00:58:44.10 --> 00:58:46.82
I think that that that was a factor in the

816
00:58:48.10 --> 00:58:50.10
In the European war

817
00:58:51.14 --> 00:58:52.74
Where was I?

818
00:58:52.74 --> 00:58:56.10
No, that's it. You were just wanting to point out the differences and we it's

819
00:58:56.74 --> 00:59:00.66
We have to bring up your bird. You your bird was named old crow

820
00:59:04.26 --> 00:59:06.26
After the whiskey

821
00:59:06.26 --> 00:59:13.06
Well, I tell my Baptist friends it's named after the most intelligent bird that flies in the sky

822
00:59:15.06 --> 00:59:19.06
But my drinking buddies all know it is named after that bourbon

823
00:59:20.74 --> 00:59:27.38
And I wouldn't call it good old anymore because it's it it's down on the bottom shelf

824
00:59:28.26 --> 00:59:30.26
It was the cheapest stuff we could find

825
00:59:30.26 --> 00:59:35.78
Oh, yeah, it's great these pictures of your of your bird

826
00:59:36.26 --> 00:59:42.10
Uh, you know, you can see very prominently. It's painted old crow is on there. Everybody knew who you were

827
00:59:43.06 --> 00:59:47.62
Uh, you know just talking about these bomber escort missions a little bit you go over some of the stuff in the book

828
00:59:47.78 --> 00:59:49.78
But the the bomber crew tour

829
00:59:50.34 --> 00:59:55.14
Was 25 missions. That's something that a lot of people talk about that that if you were in a bomber crew

830
00:59:55.54 --> 00:59:57.54
You had to go and execute

831
00:59:57.54 --> 01:00:02.58
25 missions if you got through 25 missions, you were done. You could go home

832
01:00:03.46 --> 01:00:06.58
Now what's interesting is as you pull as you pull the

833
01:00:07.62 --> 01:00:09.62
The thread on that number

834
01:00:10.10 --> 01:00:12.90
Well, they expected and anticipated

835
01:00:13.78 --> 01:00:18.74
That on each one of these big bombing missions there was going to be 4 losses

836
01:00:19.70 --> 01:00:25.70
So what does that mean? You take somebody with a 4 chance of getting shot down you multiply that times 25 and you get 100

837
01:00:25.70 --> 01:00:28.34
percent chance of getting shot down is what they had these

838
01:00:28.74 --> 01:00:35.78
Bomber guys doing and what's it what's even scarier than that was that the actual life expectancy the actual

839
01:00:36.58 --> 01:00:42.50
Number that you would get shot down on it was between 12 and 14 missions. So the 4 was a low number

840
01:00:43.62 --> 01:00:44.74
now

841
01:00:44.74 --> 01:00:50.58
interestingly my great uncle who I'm named after his name was George Gretin my middle name is Gretin

842
01:00:50.58 --> 01:00:55.30
And he was a bombardier in the 306th bomb group and he he was uh

843
01:00:56.02 --> 01:00:58.02
He flew in a b-17

844
01:00:58.18 --> 01:01:01.94
Which was known as tarheel peggie

845
01:01:02.90 --> 01:01:04.90
And tarheel peggie

846
01:01:04.90 --> 01:01:11.14
Was shot down on april 24th 1944 and this was right when you were flying in that area

847
01:01:11.30 --> 01:01:16.66
I don't know if you flew on that day, but he was shot down april 24th 1944

848
01:01:16.66 --> 01:01:21.86
There was 10 crew members on board as you were talking about five were killed and five were killed

849
01:01:22.66 --> 01:01:25.62
Five were made it out parachuted down

850
01:01:26.18 --> 01:01:30.66
Became POWs that actually includes my great uncle George Gretin

851
01:01:30.66 --> 01:01:34.50
He was a POW and he survived prison camp and eventually came home

852
01:01:34.90 --> 01:01:36.90
But that job that you guys had

853
01:01:37.86 --> 01:01:42.58
To go and protect these bombers that were going in and you you mentioned a little bit of the scale

854
01:01:42.58 --> 01:01:48.90
Uh, here's the scale of some of these missions that you all were doing. There was there was this operation

855
01:01:49.54 --> 01:01:54.98
Which was called operation argument, which you refer to in the book as the big week

856
01:01:55.46 --> 01:01:57.94
That started it. So the big week

857
01:01:59.30 --> 01:02:02.58
On one of these one one mission. This is one mission happening

858
01:02:03.22 --> 01:02:07.86
417 b-17s hit one set of targets

859
01:02:07.86 --> 01:02:12.26
314 b-17s hit another set of targets

860
01:02:12.90 --> 01:02:17.22
272 b-24s hit another set of targets

861
01:02:17.86 --> 01:02:25.30
So so right there you've got what's almost a thousand bombers heading in and they were escorted by

862
01:02:26.58 --> 01:02:28.58
94 p-38s

863
01:02:29.94 --> 01:02:35.30
668 p-47s and 73 p-51 mustangs

864
01:02:35.30 --> 01:02:38.02
This this like level

865
01:02:38.58 --> 01:02:43.78
A scale of combat is something we can't my generation Dave's generation

866
01:02:44.02 --> 01:02:48.74
We can't even comprehend what it means to have a thousand aircraft Dave

867
01:02:48.82 --> 01:02:52.90
What was the most number of aircraft you had in the sky over iraq or afghanistan?

868
01:02:53.38 --> 01:02:56.98
The missions that it was probably a big one was in the 20s 24 airplanes

869
01:02:56.98 --> 01:03:00.18
That was a mission commander for 24 airplanes and that was a handful

870
01:03:00.18 --> 01:03:09.86
Yeah, so what does it look like when you're in the air with close to 1500 or 2000 aircraft?

871
01:03:10.50 --> 01:03:16.58
Well, the beast the bombers would go in they take off real early in the morning

872
01:03:17.86 --> 01:03:19.86
assemble and then

873
01:03:20.98 --> 01:03:24.98
Get get lined up and all start climbing at the same time

874
01:03:24.98 --> 01:03:32.50
And especially in the winter or cold temperatures up there

875
01:03:34.34 --> 01:03:36.34
We'd leave

876
01:03:38.02 --> 01:03:40.02
Intense

877
01:03:41.54 --> 01:03:45.62
What the hell am I trying to oh like trails contrails and

878
01:03:47.06 --> 01:03:49.06
They would last

879
01:03:49.38 --> 01:03:51.38
You know, they were long

880
01:03:51.38 --> 01:03:55.54
And last we sometimes we made our own overcasts with all these

881
01:03:58.02 --> 01:04:00.02
Then the fighters

882
01:04:00.58 --> 01:04:02.58
Join them later

883
01:04:03.46 --> 01:04:05.46
You know

884
01:04:06.26 --> 01:04:11.30
We could see them we could see them for a hundred miles, you know forget up on top of

885
01:04:12.58 --> 01:04:14.58
the last overcast and

886
01:04:16.66 --> 01:04:19.38
And so we went ahead and we had a heading

887
01:04:19.38 --> 01:04:22.50
And he'd arrive up there

888
01:04:23.46 --> 01:04:25.46
Hopefully at the proper time

889
01:04:26.82 --> 01:04:28.82
But if it wasn't

890
01:04:28.82 --> 01:04:33.14
You remember on the tails of the b-17s they put these big letters

891
01:04:34.50 --> 01:04:36.50
Square d a

892
01:04:37.78 --> 01:04:39.78
Big big letters

893
01:04:40.18 --> 01:04:42.34
We would join see what the letters were

894
01:04:43.46 --> 01:04:45.70
And then fly up and down and find ours

895
01:04:46.10 --> 01:04:47.86
God it was

896
01:04:47.86 --> 01:04:49.86
It sounds

897
01:04:52.50 --> 01:04:56.02
It sounds hard, but actually when you're doing it every day

898
01:04:56.74 --> 01:05:01.22
It wasn't so bad, you know, just kind of routine go up here. Okay. Oh

899
01:05:01.94 --> 01:05:03.62
That's not ours

900
01:05:03.62 --> 01:05:09.94
You know go up here and there go back and would you would you be assigned to one bomber or like a group of

901
01:05:10.26 --> 01:05:13.14
How many how many would you would you and your team be covering?

902
01:05:13.14 --> 01:05:22.42
Well, that's a good question. They flew in little three-shot bees

903
01:05:23.94 --> 01:05:26.26
And there'd be about 60 of those

904
01:05:27.30 --> 01:05:29.86
60 more 60 more 60 more

905
01:05:32.74 --> 01:05:34.74
And um

906
01:05:38.98 --> 01:05:40.98
We would

907
01:05:40.98 --> 01:05:42.98
God, I don't know

908
01:05:43.54 --> 01:05:48.82
You covered just justice. Well, how many how many different radio frequencies would you have?

909
01:05:50.26 --> 01:05:54.34
Four different radio frequencies and you just flip from channel to channel

910
01:05:55.70 --> 01:06:01.70
Was there a common frequency? How can you have a common frequency with a thousand or two thousand aircraft? Well, that was the

911
01:06:03.70 --> 01:06:05.70
Emergency channel got it

912
01:06:07.78 --> 01:06:09.78
Everybody and his brother was on

913
01:06:09.78 --> 01:06:15.70
That must have just been like filled with chatter the whole time. Yeah, that was really

914
01:06:16.58 --> 01:06:19.38
And then you had a bomber fighter

915
01:06:21.54 --> 01:06:23.54
Then we had our

916
01:06:24.50 --> 01:06:26.50
Our own channel

917
01:06:28.74 --> 01:06:34.98
And we used that sometimes to come home we did we'd get a steer

918
01:06:34.98 --> 01:06:43.54
We'd uh, we'd get a practice steer, you know, what's it? What do you mean by that? What's a practice steer?

919
01:06:44.90 --> 01:06:49.14
Just terminology, but what does it mean? I don't know what it means Dave. You know what it means

920
01:06:49.78 --> 01:06:51.54
I think he's talking about giving you a vector

921
01:06:51.54 --> 01:06:54.18
So so you knew which way to go to get back to where you needed to be

922
01:06:54.74 --> 01:06:59.78
And you wouldn't want to say he didn't you wouldn't want to say I really need this now

923
01:07:00.02 --> 01:07:01.62
You know it was a practice

924
01:07:01.62 --> 01:07:05.06
You don't want to admit your you need a heading so he gave me a practice steering

925
01:07:05.06 --> 01:07:10.34
They go I want you to go 180 and and that was them telling you how to get home without having to admit it

926
01:07:16.02 --> 01:07:22.02
You probably use somebody else's voice when you're asking for those practice steers so you didn't sound like yourself

927
01:07:24.98 --> 01:07:26.18
Um

928
01:07:26.18 --> 01:07:33.46
Yeah, it's just hard for us to even imagine a 2000 aircraft in the sky. What do you when you're when you're flying in

929
01:07:33.62 --> 01:07:36.98
What's your first indication? How do you know it's how do you know the enemy's coming?

930
01:07:36.98 --> 01:07:42.50
Is it the first the anti aircraft that starts to come up the ack ack? No, you got that all the time

931
01:07:43.22 --> 01:07:45.78
That's just whenever they felt flew over

932
01:07:47.54 --> 01:07:49.54
Um, we're all wrong place

933
01:07:50.74 --> 01:07:52.02
Um

934
01:07:52.02 --> 01:08:00.34
And is that just a matter of chance whether it hits you or not some the fighters we didn't we didn't worry too much about the flag

935
01:08:01.06 --> 01:08:04.18
That was that really was after the

936
01:08:05.78 --> 01:08:07.06
bombers

937
01:08:07.06 --> 01:08:09.06
But they would shoot us

938
01:08:09.38 --> 01:08:10.66
too

939
01:08:10.66 --> 01:08:15.94
You were talking one time about looking off in the distance and and it looked like little gray puffs of smoke

940
01:08:16.02 --> 01:08:20.02
You'd see hundreds of airplanes and you and I guess probably chuck yeager more than anybody

941
01:08:20.02 --> 01:08:22.02
But you could see the enemy aircraft coming

942
01:08:23.06 --> 01:08:27.14
But it didn't look like airplanes at first. I think your description was almost it looked like little clouds

943
01:08:29.70 --> 01:08:32.82
Yeah, and it used to be that was a little hundred ship

944
01:08:36.82 --> 01:08:40.58
No, that's another thing that you know that we had to get used to

945
01:08:42.10 --> 01:08:44.10
In practice

946
01:08:45.14 --> 01:08:47.14
We were lucky to um

947
01:08:47.14 --> 01:08:55.70
Sometimes get four ships up to practice formation. That was a big deal a four ship

948
01:08:57.70 --> 01:08:59.70
We did a lot of two

949
01:09:00.26 --> 01:09:02.26
for formation training

950
01:09:04.34 --> 01:09:06.34
And every day

951
01:09:08.50 --> 01:09:12.58
In england when we flew we flew with

952
01:09:12.58 --> 01:09:17.46
16 ship formation per squadron

953
01:09:18.50 --> 01:09:20.42
three squadrons

954
01:09:20.42 --> 01:09:23.06
lead one over here and one over here

955
01:09:24.50 --> 01:09:26.50
and uh

956
01:09:28.66 --> 01:09:31.86
Two spares they flew across the channel

957
01:09:32.74 --> 01:09:34.50
turn around

958
01:09:34.50 --> 01:09:36.50
if they weren't needed

959
01:09:37.14 --> 01:09:38.58
and

960
01:09:38.58 --> 01:09:40.58
flies through two or three

961
01:09:40.58 --> 01:09:42.58
layers of overcast

962
01:09:43.70 --> 01:09:45.70
Probably more likely than not

963
01:09:48.10 --> 01:09:51.94
And we had never never flew

964
01:09:53.30 --> 01:09:57.62
I don't I think I can remember flying in a group formation one time

965
01:09:58.90 --> 01:10:00.82
in training

966
01:10:00.82 --> 01:10:02.82
Were there mishaps

967
01:10:02.98 --> 01:10:03.78
with

968
01:10:03.78 --> 01:10:08.58
Fighters hitting each other and american fighters and bombers just on the way over to the target

969
01:10:08.58 --> 01:10:12.58
Did that happen or was it was it pretty well coordinated guys figured it out really fast?

970
01:10:13.62 --> 01:10:15.62
It was pretty good

971
01:10:15.70 --> 01:10:17.70
considering

972
01:10:17.70 --> 01:10:18.98
but

973
01:10:18.98 --> 01:10:21.38
My own flight. I lost a wingman

974
01:10:22.50 --> 01:10:24.50
two flights here

975
01:10:24.74 --> 01:10:26.74
and

976
01:10:26.74 --> 01:10:28.74
Climbing through

977
01:10:29.06 --> 01:10:31.54
And somehow these two guys drift together

978
01:10:33.30 --> 01:10:35.54
One of the worst ones I ever saw was

979
01:10:35.54 --> 01:10:37.06
uh

980
01:10:37.06 --> 01:10:40.98
B17s, you know how you can have days when you can

981
01:10:42.74 --> 01:10:47.22
Look down and see pretty good, but you can't see forward

982
01:10:48.90 --> 01:10:50.90
Well, there was a lot of those

983
01:10:51.70 --> 01:10:52.90
and

984
01:10:52.90 --> 01:10:55.78
We see these two columns of b17s

985
01:10:56.82 --> 01:10:58.82
We're sitting up here

986
01:10:59.78 --> 01:11:02.10
And they're going along at the same rate

987
01:11:02.10 --> 01:11:07.62
So you can see it looking down? Yeah, and they're same altitude

988
01:11:08.66 --> 01:11:10.34
And they're going

989
01:11:10.34 --> 01:11:12.50
And they got a mission recall

990
01:11:13.86 --> 01:11:15.86
Canceled the mission

991
01:11:16.26 --> 01:11:18.26
And these guys went like this

992
01:11:18.98 --> 01:11:22.02
Oh my god, you could see it coming, you know

993
01:11:23.14 --> 01:11:25.14
Nothing you can do

994
01:11:25.14 --> 01:11:28.10
You know, they lost about four guns right there

995
01:11:28.10 --> 01:11:37.06
That was a hell of a sight to see a bomber go down. I mean to us

996
01:11:39.06 --> 01:11:41.06
Oh

997
01:11:43.06 --> 01:11:45.06
You you um

998
01:11:45.70 --> 01:11:51.62
Going to the book here a little bit and when you're you're now flying you say we were fighter pilots

999
01:11:51.62 --> 01:11:59.94
Flying the damnedest fastest most lethal airplanes anyone ever dreamed up the forward line in defense

1000
01:12:00.50 --> 01:12:02.50
Of the entire free world

1001
01:12:03.06 --> 01:12:08.58
We were 22 years old give or take two years and carrying the entire war on our shoulders

1002
01:12:08.98 --> 01:12:13.86
And doing a pretty good job of it too to judge by what the new newspapers told us

1003
01:12:14.82 --> 01:12:19.30
We were winning the fight and developing egos that would make musselini look humble

1004
01:12:19.30 --> 01:12:24.26
We weren't like other people at least not in our own minds

1005
01:12:24.82 --> 01:12:28.66
We were bolder braver smarter more spirited

1006
01:12:29.54 --> 01:12:30.82
Better

1007
01:12:30.82 --> 01:12:36.66
Our eyesight was keener our reflexes quicker. We were risk takers too who worked and played hard

1008
01:12:37.70 --> 01:12:41.78
We were confident self-reliant able to stand on our own and proud of it

1009
01:12:42.90 --> 01:12:44.90
Most of all we were motivated

1010
01:12:45.46 --> 01:12:46.66
aggressive

1011
01:12:46.66 --> 01:12:54.26
Only the fittest and most competitive survived the training and then the deadly winnowing out imposed by our last and best teacher

1012
01:12:54.50 --> 01:12:56.50
the german air force

1013
01:12:56.90 --> 01:13:02.34
I was no fighter by nature at least not with my fists. I can count the fights of my youth on one hand

1014
01:13:02.98 --> 01:13:06.58
But I enjoyed competing and racing cars or dueling with airplanes

1015
01:13:06.98 --> 01:13:11.38
Was a way of compensating for my slender build and testing myself against anyone

1016
01:13:11.38 --> 01:13:17.70
I enjoyed combat which is not quite the same thing as saying that I enjoyed killing

1017
01:13:18.26 --> 01:13:19.78
Combat was exciting

1018
01:13:19.78 --> 01:13:25.94
Addictive a test of our metal and manhood a crucible in which men became a cut above the ordinary

1019
01:13:27.06 --> 01:13:34.02
We thought that we we thought we were that and we were encouraged to think it all through our training

1020
01:13:34.26 --> 01:13:37.22
Because we couldn't have done what we did without thinking it

1021
01:13:37.22 --> 01:13:41.22
Why else would they have let us fly under bridges and buzz people's houses?

1022
01:13:41.46 --> 01:13:45.22
It took a big ego to fly to Berlin with anything resembling enthusiasm

1023
01:13:45.94 --> 01:13:53.86
We were never afraid most of us anyway. I truly believe that scared sometimes you would have to be stupid not to be concerned

1024
01:13:54.74 --> 01:13:55.78
respectful

1025
01:13:55.78 --> 01:14:03.46
But never afraid the way a little kid is afraid of the dark or the way you might fear some dark alley knowing something is there waiting for you

1026
01:14:03.46 --> 01:14:08.50
Waiting for you. We were so young. I suppose we just didn't know any better

1027
01:14:09.78 --> 01:14:12.82
Combat is like a near miss in an automobile

1028
01:14:13.06 --> 01:14:17.38
It happens and you react instinctively to it and later on you might say

1029
01:14:18.26 --> 01:14:24.02
That was close and your fingers might tremble a little but while it's happening you don't pause to assess it and say

1030
01:14:24.26 --> 01:14:26.26
My god, I'm going to die here

1031
01:14:26.34 --> 01:14:29.14
There simply isn't time. You just do what you have to do

1032
01:14:29.14 --> 01:14:37.30
I never saw a man crack not in our group. I don't remember anyone standing down because he was what we called

1033
01:14:37.70 --> 01:14:39.30
Flack happy

1034
01:14:39.30 --> 01:14:43.70
There was a guy who lost a brother and wept openly every so often about it

1035
01:14:44.42 --> 01:14:46.42
But he flew he did his job

1036
01:14:47.22 --> 01:14:50.58
Nobody had to be lifted out of his cockpit frozen up staring

1037
01:14:51.38 --> 01:14:56.42
Stress at least in our corner of England wasn't what hollywood might have you believe

1038
01:14:56.42 --> 01:14:59.78
Although it was there no denying it

1039
01:15:03.30 --> 01:15:05.30
So there's the attitude

1040
01:15:05.30 --> 01:15:09.38
You know you point something else you point something else out in here. I had a violet, right?

1041
01:15:10.02 --> 01:15:11.14
sir

1042
01:15:11.14 --> 01:15:13.14
This is like I have to deal with Dave all the time on this stuff

1043
01:15:14.66 --> 01:15:17.94
The description couldn't be better. It's written perfectly

1044
01:15:19.94 --> 01:15:23.46
You also mentioned in the book and I don't think I have it marked out to read but

1045
01:15:23.46 --> 01:15:26.34
You talk about how when you look at the films that they made

1046
01:15:27.06 --> 01:15:28.58
after the war

1047
01:15:28.58 --> 01:15:32.90
All the pilots are 30 30 30 years old or 35 years old

1048
01:15:33.54 --> 01:15:36.66
You know in the in the famous world war II fighter pilots

1049
01:15:37.22 --> 01:15:41.22
And you say it was a bunch of kids that were 20 21 22 years old

1050
01:15:42.18 --> 01:15:43.86
Yeah

1051
01:15:43.86 --> 01:15:45.86
That's right

1052
01:15:46.42 --> 01:15:48.42
I'm going to go to a little combat here

1053
01:15:48.42 --> 01:15:54.74
Flying skill I've always felt meant more in Europe than it did in other theaters where the airplanes had different

1054
01:15:54.90 --> 01:15:58.18
differing strong points the p38 was successful in the pacific

1055
01:15:58.42 --> 01:16:01.54
Although it couldn't turn with the zero because it was much faster when diving

1056
01:16:02.02 --> 01:16:06.42
Its pilot could attack from above and then keep going and the zero had no chance of catching it

1057
01:16:06.90 --> 01:16:08.90
Same with the p40 earlier on

1058
01:16:09.38 --> 01:16:12.42
The fog wolves and measurements had more speed

1059
01:16:12.42 --> 01:16:18.82
The pacific tactics wouldn't work on these aircraft and the p38s was much less effective against them

1060
01:16:19.30 --> 01:16:23.62
To beat them you had to turn with them like i'm turning with this 109

1061
01:16:24.18 --> 01:16:30.90
Right now northwest of Hanover. We're flying in interlocking circles, but on differing planes

1062
01:16:31.54 --> 01:16:37.62
Descending we pass one another once twice three times at ridiculous angles

1063
01:16:38.10 --> 01:16:40.10
With neither of us in a position to fire

1064
01:16:40.10 --> 01:16:47.30
I feel like i'm gaining but not very much and i'm excited and impatient and getting terribly frustrated that I can't get a shot

1065
01:16:48.18 --> 01:16:52.74
I've worked the angle down to where our paths are crossing at 40 to 60 degrees

1066
01:16:53.46 --> 01:17:01.22
What you want ideally is zero to 10 with the enemy either moving almost directly away or coming almost straight at you

1067
01:17:01.94 --> 01:17:06.34
Anything over 30 degrees. It's almost pointless to shoot with a fixed sight

1068
01:17:06.34 --> 01:17:14.10
Of course these same numbers this same geometry problem are probably running through the mind of the meserschmitt pilot

1069
01:17:15.14 --> 01:17:22.10
I'd been considered a rather good marksman in the p39 and t6 at both our gunnery school and later at the rafs

1070
01:17:22.66 --> 01:17:30.26
Now i've flown nine missions triggered my guns only once and still have no kills, but i'm cocky enough to try something bizarre

1071
01:17:30.26 --> 01:17:36.74
I decide to pull my sights through the german keep pulling my nose up until i can't see him then fire

1072
01:17:37.06 --> 01:17:43.06
Hose him and hope against all odds that he flies through the stream. What the hell worth a try?

1073
01:17:44.10 --> 01:17:48.90
I pull up and fire off a quick stream of tracer as he disappears underneath me

1074
01:17:50.10 --> 01:17:55.86
And another for luck. I ease the stick back and he flies back into my view hot damn

1075
01:17:55.86 --> 01:18:00.42
Hot damn. He's spilling coolant back into his slipstream. I got him

1076
01:18:01.94 --> 01:18:04.26
Got a goddamn golden bb on him

1077
01:18:04.90 --> 01:18:09.14
Punctured his radiator or severed a coolant line got my first kill

1078
01:18:10.26 --> 01:18:15.86
And while i'm whooping like i just scored the touchdown that won the rolls bow rolls bowl

1079
01:18:16.34 --> 01:18:18.66
He throws the canopy off and bails out

1080
01:18:19.54 --> 01:18:21.54
His 109 goes straight in

1081
01:18:22.26 --> 01:18:24.26
exploding

1082
01:18:24.26 --> 01:18:26.26
That's your first kill right there

1083
01:18:27.14 --> 01:18:29.14
Still putting a smile on your face

1084
01:18:29.62 --> 01:18:36.42
You haven't read the rest about there. Well, yeah after this a guy sneaks up on you, but luckily it's it's another p51, right?

1085
01:18:40.42 --> 01:18:42.42
Yeah

1086
01:18:42.58 --> 01:18:45.38
Yeah, uh, what happened afterwards

1087
01:18:47.22 --> 01:18:49.22
I felt

1088
01:18:49.22 --> 01:18:56.90
Oh, you know, I got a here's a guy. He's flying close formation with me right now. He pulled right up there

1089
01:18:58.10 --> 01:19:00.10
pretty quick after the

1090
01:19:00.98 --> 01:19:02.98
the kill

1091
01:19:03.62 --> 01:19:09.70
How do you down low he had his mask off and he was grinning and he gave me something like that, you know, or

1092
01:19:10.74 --> 01:19:13.46
I don't know. I didn't and I thought wait a minute

1093
01:19:14.74 --> 01:19:17.86
Did he shoot that thing down out from under me? You know

1094
01:19:17.86 --> 01:19:23.46
And I thought I my shot had to be the luckiest shot in the world, you know

1095
01:19:24.34 --> 01:19:26.34
to be able to

1096
01:19:26.74 --> 01:19:28.74
Blindly get that lead

1097
01:19:29.54 --> 01:19:31.54
And then see him come through

1098
01:19:32.90 --> 01:19:34.90
So all the way home I

1099
01:19:36.18 --> 01:19:41.62
I convinced myself. I probably did not shoot that airplane down that he got it

1100
01:19:41.62 --> 01:19:48.66
And it was Johnny England England Air Force Base. That was the guy that the base was named for

1101
01:19:50.10 --> 01:19:53.30
And so I get home. He's in a different squadron

1102
01:19:54.90 --> 01:19:56.90
and I

1103
01:19:58.58 --> 01:20:00.58
Get home

1104
01:20:00.58 --> 01:20:02.58
I make a claim to the intelligence

1105
01:20:04.74 --> 01:20:06.74
Officer briefing

1106
01:20:06.74 --> 01:20:12.10
And then I said but just hold it. I got to go get confirmation from a

1107
01:20:13.46 --> 01:20:16.90
Guy that's obviously saw what was going on

1108
01:20:19.70 --> 01:20:21.70
So now I'm riding uh

1109
01:20:22.82 --> 01:20:28.82
Going in the jeep or to the officer's club and can you tell who the other pilot is or you just know what squadron he is

1110
01:20:29.14 --> 01:20:32.82
No, I know who he was. Oh, so you could see him. You're that close to him. You look at

1111
01:20:32.82 --> 01:20:36.42
Oh, yeah, I got his mask and I could see his

1112
01:20:37.14 --> 01:20:40.02
The name on his airplane. He already had two kills

1113
01:20:41.62 --> 01:20:43.62
and so

1114
01:20:44.02 --> 01:20:46.18
I think how am I going to bring this up?

1115
01:20:47.22 --> 01:20:50.74
You know, am I going to say hey you asshole?

1116
01:20:51.94 --> 01:20:54.82
Did oh, you could you could bleep this out

1117
01:20:55.54 --> 01:20:58.74
You're good. You're good. We're amongst friends

1118
01:20:58.74 --> 01:21:03.38
I I asked, oh, did you shoot that thing down out from under me?

1119
01:21:04.82 --> 01:21:06.42
um

1120
01:21:06.42 --> 01:21:08.82
Or you know, just how am I going to

1121
01:21:10.34 --> 01:21:12.34
Put it to him

1122
01:21:12.42 --> 01:21:16.42
So I go in the officers club and he's over here

1123
01:21:17.54 --> 01:21:20.58
He sees me and he comes running over to me

1124
01:21:21.30 --> 01:21:23.30
And he says Andy

1125
01:21:23.30 --> 01:21:28.82
He says that was the best shot I've ever seen. You got that guy out there about 60 degrees angle off

1126
01:21:29.46 --> 01:21:31.46
I said, oh Johnny

1127
01:21:32.50 --> 01:21:34.50
Lucky shot

1128
01:21:34.98 --> 01:21:41.30
And as soon as we were through I rushed to my phone and I got my first kill. There you go

1129
01:21:41.30 --> 01:21:52.02
Did you guys put the did you guys put the the swastika on your plane the little mini swastika for a kill very quickly very quickly?

1130
01:21:53.94 --> 01:21:55.94
Oh, that's awesome

1131
01:21:55.94 --> 01:21:56.82
uh

1132
01:21:56.82 --> 01:21:58.98
You got a section in here

1133
01:21:59.46 --> 01:22:01.30
um

1134
01:22:01.30 --> 01:22:06.02
That it's about another dogfight and I I believe it's probably the one you remember the best you

1135
01:22:06.82 --> 01:22:09.78
It's called the straight up encounter. Oh, yeah

1136
01:22:09.78 --> 01:22:13.22
And I've got to read this. This is just an incredible

1137
01:22:13.78 --> 01:22:15.78
um

1138
01:22:15.86 --> 01:22:17.86
Situation here and I'm going to go to the book

1139
01:22:18.82 --> 01:22:20.82
I am in this steep climb

1140
01:22:21.38 --> 01:22:25.38
Pulling the stick into my navel making it steeper steeper

1141
01:22:26.02 --> 01:22:30.42
And I'm looking back down over my shoulder at this classic gray

1142
01:22:30.98 --> 01:22:39.14
Me 109 with black crosses that is pulling up to steeper steeper the pilot trying to get his nose up just a little bit more

1143
01:22:39.14 --> 01:22:41.14
And bring me into his sights

1144
01:22:42.34 --> 01:22:45.94
There's nothing distinctive about the aircraft no fancy markings

1145
01:22:46.18 --> 01:22:52.90
Nothing to identify it is the plane of an ace as as one of the dreaded yellow noses like you see in the movie

1146
01:22:53.30 --> 01:22:56.26
Some of them did that I know but I never saw one

1147
01:22:56.82 --> 01:23:03.78
And in any event all of their aces weren't flamboyant types who splash plane on their paint on their airplanes to show who they were

1148
01:23:05.22 --> 01:23:07.86
He was someone who was trying to kill me is all

1149
01:23:07.86 --> 01:23:14.26
So I'm looking back almost straight down now and I can see this 20 millimeter

1150
01:23:14.82 --> 01:23:18.34
Canon sticking through the middle of the fighters propeller hub

1151
01:23:19.30 --> 01:23:22.10
In the theater of memory. It was enormous

1152
01:23:22.98 --> 01:23:24.98
an elephant gun

1153
01:23:25.06 --> 01:23:26.58
And that isn't far wrong

1154
01:23:26.58 --> 01:23:32.02
It is a gun designed to bring down a bomber one that fires shells as long as your hand

1155
01:23:32.42 --> 01:23:35.78
Shells that explode and tear big holes in metal

1156
01:23:35.78 --> 01:23:41.54
Is the single most frightening thing I have seen in my life then and now

1157
01:23:43.22 --> 01:23:45.22
But I'm too busy to be frightened

1158
01:23:45.78 --> 01:23:47.78
And I am extremely busy up here

1159
01:23:48.34 --> 01:23:53.78
Hanging by my propeller going almost straight up full emergency power

1160
01:23:54.10 --> 01:23:58.02
Which a Mustang could do for only so long before losing speed

1161
01:23:58.50 --> 01:23:59.54
shuttering

1162
01:23:59.54 --> 01:24:06.42
Stalling and falling back down and I am thinking that if the Mustang stalls before the Messerschmitt stalls

1163
01:24:06.98 --> 01:24:08.98
I have had it

1164
01:24:09.30 --> 01:24:10.82
I look back

1165
01:24:10.82 --> 01:24:14.34
And I can see that he's shuttering on the verge of a stall

1166
01:24:14.66 --> 01:24:21.94
He hasn't been able to get his nose up enough hasn't been able to bring that big gun to bear almost but not quite

1167
01:24:23.14 --> 01:24:25.94
I'm a fallen down dead man almost

1168
01:24:26.66 --> 01:24:28.58
but not quite

1169
01:24:28.58 --> 01:24:32.90
His nose begins dropping just as my airplane too begins shuttering

1170
01:24:33.86 --> 01:24:38.42
He stalls a second or two before I stall drops away before I do

1171
01:24:39.70 --> 01:24:41.70
Good old Mustang

1172
01:24:42.10 --> 01:24:46.50
He is falling away now and I flop the nose over and go after him hard

1173
01:24:47.22 --> 01:24:52.50
We are very high by this time six miles and then some and falling very very fast

1174
01:24:52.74 --> 01:24:57.54
The Messerschmitt had a head start plummeting out of my range, but I'm closing up quickly

1175
01:24:57.54 --> 01:25:04.90
Then he flattens out and comes around hard to the left and starts climbing again as if he wants to come at me head on

1176
01:25:05.62 --> 01:25:07.62
Suddenly we were right back where we started

1177
01:25:08.66 --> 01:25:12.90
A lot of this is just instinct now things are happening too fast to think everything out

1178
01:25:13.06 --> 01:25:15.06
You stay with your right hand and feet

1179
01:25:15.30 --> 01:25:20.74
The right hand also triggers the guns with your left you work the throttle and keep the airplane in trim

1180
01:25:20.74 --> 01:25:23.62
Which is easier to do than to describe

1181
01:25:23.62 --> 01:25:31.38
Any airplane with a single propeller produces torque the more horsepower you have the more prop will pull you off to one side

1182
01:25:32.18 --> 01:25:38.10
The Mustang I flew used a 12 cylinder Packard Merlin engine that displaced

1183
01:25:38.98 --> 01:25:40.98
1649 cubic inches

1184
01:25:42.02 --> 01:25:46.26
That's 10 times the size of the engine that powers an Indy car

1185
01:25:46.26 --> 01:25:53.62
It developed power enough that you never applied full power sitting still on the ground because it would pull the plane's tail up off the runway

1186
01:25:54.02 --> 01:25:56.18
And the propeller would chew up the concrete

1187
01:25:56.98 --> 01:26:06.26
With so much power you are continually making minor adjustments on the controls to keep the Mustang and its wing mounted guns pointed straight

1188
01:26:07.54 --> 01:26:13.30
It's a little unnerving to think about how many things you have to deal with all at once to fly combat

1189
01:26:13.30 --> 01:26:19.38
So the mischish mid is coming around again climbing hard to his left and I've had about enough of this

1190
01:26:20.18 --> 01:26:22.26
My angle is a little bit better this time

1191
01:26:22.50 --> 01:26:27.06
So I roll the dice instead of cobbling it like before and sailing on by him

1192
01:26:27.38 --> 01:26:35.86
I decide to turn hard left inside him knowing that if I lose speed and don't make it I probably won't get home

1193
01:26:37.62 --> 01:26:40.10
I pull back on the throttle slightly

1194
01:26:40.10 --> 01:26:48.34
I pull back on the throttle slightly put down 10 degrees of flaps and haul back on the stick just as hard as I can

1195
01:26:49.14 --> 01:26:51.14
The nose begins coming around

1196
01:26:51.94 --> 01:26:53.94
slowly slowly

1197
01:26:54.66 --> 01:26:59.62
Hot damn. I'm going to make it. I'm inside him pulling my sights up to him

1198
01:27:00.82 --> 01:27:02.82
And the German pilot can see this

1199
01:27:02.82 --> 01:27:10.02
This time it's the mesheshmit that breaks away and goes zooming straight up engine at maximum power without much alternative

1200
01:27:10.82 --> 01:27:15.62
I come in with full power and follow him up and the gap narrows swiftly

1201
01:27:16.42 --> 01:27:21.78
He is hanging by his prop not quite vertically and I am right there behind him

1202
01:27:21.78 --> 01:27:30.02
And it is terribly clear having tested this theory less than a minute ago that he is going to stall and fall away before I do

1203
01:27:30.02 --> 01:27:32.02
I have him

1204
01:27:32.02 --> 01:27:34.02
He must know that I have him

1205
01:27:34.02 --> 01:27:42.98
I bring my nose up he comes into my sights and from less than 300 yards I trigger a long merciless burst from my brownings

1206
01:27:44.02 --> 01:27:50.98
Every fifth bullet or so is a tracer leaving a trail of thin smoke marking the path of the bullet stream

1207
01:27:51.54 --> 01:27:58.18
The tracers race upward and find him the bullets chew at the wing root the cockpit the engine

1208
01:27:58.18 --> 01:28:00.18
making bright little flashes

1209
01:28:01.06 --> 01:28:08.90
I hose the mesheshmit down the way you'd hose down a campfire methodically from one end to the other not wanting to make a mistake

1210
01:28:09.86 --> 01:28:15.22
The 109 shakes like a retriever coming out of the water throwing off pieces

1211
01:28:16.10 --> 01:28:21.38
He slows almost stops as if parked in the sky his propeller just wind milling

1212
01:28:22.50 --> 01:28:24.50
And he begins smoking heavily

1213
01:28:24.50 --> 01:28:30.82
My momentum carries me to him. I throttle back to ease my plane alongside just off his right wing

1214
01:28:30.82 --> 01:28:34.26
Have I killed him? I do not particularly want to fight this man again

1215
01:28:35.14 --> 01:28:37.14
I'm coming up even with the cockpit

1216
01:28:37.94 --> 01:28:44.50
Cockpit and although I figure less I know about him the better. I find myself looking in spite of myself

1217
01:28:45.62 --> 01:28:49.70
There's smoke in the cockpit. I can see that and nothing more

1218
01:28:50.58 --> 01:28:52.58
Another few feet

1219
01:28:52.58 --> 01:28:58.58
And then he falls away suddenly left wing down right wing rising up obscuring my view

1220
01:28:59.22 --> 01:29:04.98
I am looking at the 109's sky blue belly the wheel wells twin radiators grease marks

1221
01:29:05.38 --> 01:29:07.70
Streaks from the guns the black crosses

1222
01:29:08.58 --> 01:29:10.58
I am close enough to make out the rivets

1223
01:29:11.54 --> 01:29:17.22
The mesheshmit is right there and then it is gone just like that rolling away and dropping its nose

1224
01:29:17.22 --> 01:29:25.14
Falling almost straight down leaking coolant and trailing flame and smoke so black and thick it has to be smoke or oil

1225
01:29:27.14 --> 01:29:33.70
It simply plunges headed straight for the deck no spin not even a wobble no parachute

1226
01:29:34.34 --> 01:29:36.34
And now I am wondering

1227
01:29:36.34 --> 01:29:38.34
His ship seems a death ship

1228
01:29:39.22 --> 01:29:41.22
But is it

1229
01:29:41.22 --> 01:29:43.70
Undecided I peel off and begin chasing him down

1230
01:29:43.70 --> 01:29:48.58
Did I squander a chance here? Have I let him escape? He's diving hard through

1231
01:29:49.38 --> 01:29:55.06
He is diving hard enough to be shedding his wings harder than anyone designed those airplanes to dive

1232
01:29:55.06 --> 01:30:01.86
500 miles an hour and more and if 109's will stall sooner then the Mustang is going straight up

1233
01:30:01.86 --> 01:30:05.70
Now I am worrying mate that maybe their wings stay on longer

1234
01:30:06.82 --> 01:30:09.62
At 25,000 feet I begin to grow nervous

1235
01:30:09.62 --> 01:30:12.58
At 25,000 feet I begin to grow nervous

1236
01:30:13.46 --> 01:30:17.70
I pull back on the throttle ease out of the dive and watch him go down

1237
01:30:18.50 --> 01:30:21.22
I have no more stomach for this kind of thing and right now

1238
01:30:21.86 --> 01:30:23.86
Not right now not with this guy

1239
01:30:25.22 --> 01:30:26.74
enough

1240
01:30:26.74 --> 01:30:28.74
Let him go and to hell with him

1241
01:30:29.78 --> 01:30:31.78
Straight down he plunges

1242
01:30:31.78 --> 01:30:33.78
From his highest 35,000 feet

1243
01:30:33.78 --> 01:30:40.18
Through this beautiful crystal clear may morning toward the green on green checkerboard fields

1244
01:30:40.18 --> 01:30:42.18
Leaving a wake of black smoke

1245
01:30:43.38 --> 01:30:47.54
From four miles straight up I watch as the mischersmith and the shadow

1246
01:30:47.54 --> 01:30:50.82
It makes on the ground rush toward one another

1247
01:30:51.78 --> 01:30:53.78
And then finally

1248
01:30:54.34 --> 01:30:56.02
Silently

1249
01:30:56.02 --> 01:31:04.02
They merge

1250
01:31:05.54 --> 01:31:09.30
I think I just found a guy for my my audio book

1251
01:31:10.82 --> 01:31:12.82
I know how you feel

1252
01:31:14.82 --> 01:31:16.82
That's just um

1253
01:31:16.82 --> 01:31:25.06
Yeah, Dave what's your breakdown of that it's give us give us a breakdown. I I'm actually just

1254
01:31:27.70 --> 01:31:31.62
I'm kind of at a loss for words and I know this sounds maybe even sounds a little arrogant

1255
01:31:31.62 --> 01:31:34.98
I can picture what he's saying. So even when he's talking about

1256
01:31:35.70 --> 01:31:37.22
He you're right here

1257
01:31:37.22 --> 01:31:42.98
Sir, even when you're when you're talking about looking down your wing lines seeing his nose come up to you and you know

1258
01:31:42.98 --> 01:31:50.10
If he's got two or three more degrees on you, which is which is kind of like a matter of inches really in an airplane

1259
01:31:50.82 --> 01:31:52.42
that he's gonna get

1260
01:31:52.42 --> 01:31:54.42
That this measurements gonna get a shot

1261
01:31:55.30 --> 01:32:02.50
And the the sinking feeling that comes with seconds later the elation of watching him shudder and you know that he can't keep his turn

1262
01:32:03.14 --> 01:32:05.14
even the angles and the fault so

1263
01:32:05.78 --> 01:32:09.94
Your ability to get another pilot to see through their eyes what you're seeing

1264
01:32:09.94 --> 01:32:17.30
Is it is it is remarkable how well it is written in a way to describe it

1265
01:32:18.50 --> 01:32:21.46
So I can feel what you're seeing not just see it

1266
01:32:21.54 --> 01:32:24.50
It is just unbelievable to listen you describe that

1267
01:32:25.06 --> 01:32:29.38
And then the shadows you know merging with the airframe and then at your altitude

1268
01:32:29.54 --> 01:32:31.54
It's probably a fireball, but you don't hear anything

1269
01:32:32.26 --> 01:32:34.26
And everything in between there is just

1270
01:32:36.10 --> 01:32:38.10
I have never seen something written

1271
01:32:38.10 --> 01:32:43.30
Well enough to see it with my own eyes as what you wrote in that dogfight

1272
01:32:44.02 --> 01:32:50.10
Um, it's it's really amazing for me to hear and I'm really grateful that you have the ability to get that on paper and capture that forever

1273
01:32:51.46 --> 01:32:53.46
We may uh

1274
01:32:54.10 --> 01:32:55.86
blame

1275
01:32:55.86 --> 01:32:57.86
Joe hamlin. Yeah, well

1276
01:32:58.90 --> 01:33:02.50
He didn't fly the airplane. I know that well the stories are all mine

1277
01:33:03.78 --> 01:33:05.78
And when it came to

1278
01:33:05.78 --> 01:33:09.54
Oh, well, we first had to get together

1279
01:33:10.82 --> 01:33:12.82
And he'd go home and write

1280
01:33:13.22 --> 01:33:15.54
A couple of chapters and then we would

1281
01:33:16.66 --> 01:33:21.70
Come back and review them and I said Joe this word isn't even in my inventory

1282
01:33:23.86 --> 01:33:25.86
You know and uh

1283
01:33:27.22 --> 01:33:30.74
We'd go on and on like to say I don't even know what that means

1284
01:33:32.98 --> 01:33:34.50
and

1285
01:33:34.50 --> 01:33:37.30
We had that and then when it came to the flying

1286
01:33:40.26 --> 01:33:42.26
He would try it and I said

1287
01:33:43.46 --> 01:33:46.34
Joe give me a yellow pad over there

1288
01:33:47.30 --> 01:33:49.78
And I'd write it all out in the long hand

1289
01:33:51.06 --> 01:33:53.06
I said don't change a word

1290
01:33:54.58 --> 01:33:58.98
And but after we got together so many times

1291
01:34:00.10 --> 01:34:02.10
He really got into my head

1292
01:34:02.10 --> 01:34:04.10
Yeah, he did a marvelous job

1293
01:34:06.10 --> 01:34:08.10
And uh and then

1294
01:34:09.86 --> 01:34:14.10
Even when I said don't change your word sometimes he'd try

1295
01:34:16.02 --> 01:34:18.02
And I might or might not

1296
01:34:18.34 --> 01:34:20.34
Leave it because he

1297
01:34:20.42 --> 01:34:22.58
He was he is a good writer

1298
01:34:23.94 --> 01:34:27.30
Absolutely, I would have taken my book and say

1299
01:34:27.30 --> 01:34:34.34
I was born on January 13th 1922 blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah you know

1300
01:34:35.06 --> 01:34:37.06
But you know the way he mixed

1301
01:34:37.94 --> 01:34:43.78
Mixed it through the book, right? I think was really good. Yeah, no, that's so that's the just for everyone that's listening

1302
01:34:43.78 --> 01:34:47.78
That's the the the co-author of the book that helped write the book

1303
01:34:48.58 --> 01:34:50.58
Joe Hamlin did a great job

1304
01:34:51.62 --> 01:34:55.70
When when you're so when you're looking over your shoulder at this measuresmith

1305
01:34:55.70 --> 01:34:57.70
And they're start he's starting to stall

1306
01:34:58.26 --> 01:35:02.58
So you can see that you can see the plane start to kind of shake I said

1307
01:35:03.70 --> 01:35:05.70
I

1308
01:35:05.70 --> 01:35:07.70
Seem shutter right but

1309
01:35:07.70 --> 01:35:13.54
I don't think you can see it shutter shutters a feel in the airplane. You know you feel

1310
01:35:13.70 --> 01:35:18.42
But there's some visual thing that's going on that you go. Oh, he's not gonna make it much

1311
01:35:18.42 --> 01:35:22.26
Sloppy he got sloppy, you know, that's the beginning of a stall

1312
01:35:22.26 --> 01:35:27.54
And that's the beginning of a stall and you can probably sense when you're about done

1313
01:35:28.18 --> 01:35:31.30
Going up too. So you knew that you were close. Oh, yeah

1314
01:35:36.26 --> 01:35:38.26
And then when you're shooting

1315
01:35:39.46 --> 01:35:41.46
That that aircraft

1316
01:35:41.62 --> 01:35:48.90
You have to make little micro adjustments with your nose to get like you're saying you hose it down like you would a campfire

1317
01:35:48.90 --> 01:35:53.94
So you're making little tiny adjustments to kind of sweep up and down on that aircraft with your

1318
01:35:54.66 --> 01:35:59.86
maneuvering. Yeah, you know maneuvering was maneuvering is just a little bit of rudder

1319
01:36:00.34 --> 01:36:02.10
Yeah

1320
01:36:02.10 --> 01:36:05.14
Small amount you had to keep it in trim

1321
01:36:06.18 --> 01:36:09.78
And I don't what I mean in trim keep the ball centered

1322
01:36:11.30 --> 01:36:13.30
If you had a ball off

1323
01:36:13.30 --> 01:36:18.34
Then you're you know, you're shooting

1324
01:36:19.62 --> 01:36:21.62
And the airplanes over here

1325
01:36:21.94 --> 01:36:24.18
You can't you gotta you can't

1326
01:36:24.98 --> 01:36:32.34
Oh, so this makes whereas normally you could get away with having trim be off a little bit because you're still just maintaining some kind of a bearing

1327
01:36:32.42 --> 01:36:37.30
But in this situation if your trim is off a little bit your guns pointed in the wrong direction might might be you know

1328
01:36:37.46 --> 01:36:40.66
And you've got you're making these constant micro adjustments and I actually

1329
01:36:40.66 --> 01:36:44.74
That's a part of the book that I didn't quite go into the

1330
01:36:45.54 --> 01:36:48.18
Level of detail that you have to do to keep that trim

1331
01:36:48.42 --> 01:36:54.74
But I failed to understand why that's so important in a gunfight when you have fixed sights

1332
01:36:55.22 --> 01:37:00.66
Because like if you're flying an aircraft, I mean I've taken off an air small airplanes before where there's a strong crosswind

1333
01:37:01.14 --> 01:37:06.66
The plane is going if you look at the heading of the plane. It's like 10 degrees off the direction you're heading

1334
01:37:06.90 --> 01:37:08.90
But you're still going in the right direction

1335
01:37:08.90 --> 01:37:12.18
So if you do that with your gun that's going to be a problem

1336
01:37:12.42 --> 01:37:14.74
So you've got to keep that thing perfectly trimmed all the time

1337
01:37:15.30 --> 01:37:18.98
Dave you didn't have to do any of that. Well, he had a computer doing all this for him, sir

1338
01:37:19.14 --> 01:37:22.02
Well, we we got the early computers

1339
01:37:23.22 --> 01:37:28.58
You had it harder than I did because in a jet moving the throttles in a jet doesn't change your trim

1340
01:37:29.30 --> 01:37:32.74
Every time you move the throttle on a propeller you change the torque

1341
01:37:33.38 --> 01:37:36.90
Every movement of a throttle and I have a little bit of propeller time

1342
01:37:36.90 --> 01:37:41.54
I learned to fly on a propeller airplane every time you move the throttle forward or back you have to adjust the rudder trim

1343
01:37:41.78 --> 01:37:44.58
So when he talks about the ball, we called it stepping on the ball

1344
01:37:44.66 --> 01:37:48.18
Which is a little literally a little gauge that has a little white

1345
01:37:48.82 --> 01:37:53.14
background in a little black floating ball that would tell you if your nose and tail are aligned

1346
01:37:53.86 --> 01:37:56.66
It'd be like pointing a gun with your wrist cocked in one direction or another

1347
01:37:57.86 --> 01:38:01.46
Every time I move the throttle on the jet the computer said we're okay. Don't worry about it

1348
01:38:01.46 --> 01:38:07.62
The ball is always centered every time in a prop prop you have to either use your feet or use the rudder trim

1349
01:38:07.62 --> 01:38:09.46
So when he's talking about

1350
01:38:09.46 --> 01:38:14.74
Moving the throttle what he's not saying is that every single movement of that throttle meant moving my feet

1351
01:38:15.06 --> 01:38:19.22
Moving with my thumb moving my hand. So the the intricacy to be able to track

1352
01:38:20.42 --> 01:38:24.18
An me 109 that's probably what 30 feet long and 30 feet wide

1353
01:38:24.18 --> 01:38:32.98
We're the the the accuracy to do that is so precise to be able to do that in a dogfight like that is so hard to do

1354
01:38:34.18 --> 01:38:38.18
I got the kernel here. It was like the humblest guy in the world saying Joe's a good writer, which I know he is

1355
01:38:38.98 --> 01:38:42.42
But he didn't track that any 109 with his p51

1356
01:38:43.06 --> 01:38:50.26
The way that you did so I still just it's remarkable that you're able to capture that and and I'm trying to do justice to how

1357
01:38:50.26 --> 01:38:54.90
How difficult that is and how intricate that physical movement is in your airplane

1358
01:38:55.94 --> 01:39:01.14
Also, the fact that you describe this one-on-one engagement that's something that I always loved as a fighter pilot

1359
01:39:01.62 --> 01:39:04.66
Was ultimately at the very end what it would come down to you and somebody else

1360
01:39:05.38 --> 01:39:09.62
But what's hard for for me to really truly grasp is that there's a war going on around you

1361
01:39:09.70 --> 01:39:12.10
You weren't the only two airplanes in the sky at that time

1362
01:39:12.18 --> 01:39:18.74
So your ability to compartmentalize and focus on this one airplane as part of a much larger thing going on is

1363
01:39:18.74 --> 01:39:21.94
To me equally as remarkable and the thing is is that

1364
01:39:22.90 --> 01:39:24.90
what we call

1365
01:39:25.14 --> 01:39:27.14
situational awareness

1366
01:39:27.86 --> 01:39:30.42
You have to do that. You have to know

1367
01:39:31.86 --> 01:39:35.94
And I've got a real good example of when we were doing a dogfight

1368
01:39:37.70 --> 01:39:39.70
I saw a shadow

1369
01:39:40.66 --> 01:39:42.66
and

1370
01:39:42.66 --> 01:39:49.14
When we were through I said hey guys, do you see anything shadow or anything? No, no, no

1371
01:39:50.10 --> 01:39:56.66
Okay, come on down get lined up here. I said I knew it was going west generally speaking and

1372
01:39:57.62 --> 01:39:59.62
So I go along here

1373
01:40:00.50 --> 01:40:02.50
Pretty soon

1374
01:40:02.58 --> 01:40:05.62
We come up and I see the shadow again

1375
01:40:06.42 --> 01:40:08.42
Before I can see the airplane

1376
01:40:08.42 --> 01:40:14.50
And that was a bright sunny day, you know, it was a green hungry

1377
01:40:16.42 --> 01:40:18.42
Camel

1378
01:40:18.50 --> 01:40:21.46
And if it'd been hazy I never would have seen him

1379
01:40:22.82 --> 01:40:27.06
And so I come up and that's a hunk of 111 K

1380
01:40:28.10 --> 01:40:29.30
Poor guy

1381
01:40:29.30 --> 01:40:31.30
all obsolete

1382
01:40:32.10 --> 01:40:34.10
Battle of Britain bomber

1383
01:40:35.06 --> 01:40:37.06
and

1384
01:40:37.06 --> 01:40:40.90
We had a gunner we silenced the gunner

1385
01:40:42.34 --> 01:40:44.34
And we got both engines spoken

1386
01:40:45.78 --> 01:40:50.42
And so I scored my I bumped back over here on the

1387
01:40:51.22 --> 01:40:53.22
From this side to that side

1388
01:40:53.94 --> 01:40:56.98
And I'm scoring them as they as they shoot

1389
01:40:58.42 --> 01:41:00.90
So that's how you get a quarter of a kill

1390
01:41:01.46 --> 01:41:03.46
share the whole thing

1391
01:41:03.46 --> 01:41:07.54
And my number four guys a new head, you know new

1392
01:41:08.26 --> 01:41:10.26
inexperienced guy and he

1393
01:41:10.50 --> 01:41:14.10
He fired every round on one pass

1394
01:41:15.70 --> 01:41:19.54
And you could imagine where the bullets were going

1395
01:41:21.06 --> 01:41:23.06
He burned the barrels out, you know

1396
01:41:24.26 --> 01:41:26.50
And we only had 30 seconds of

1397
01:41:27.30 --> 01:41:28.98
of

1398
01:41:28.98 --> 01:41:30.82
Gunfire

1399
01:41:30.82 --> 01:41:33.54
Yeah, that's not not much. I know

1400
01:41:36.90 --> 01:41:39.86
He come home a couple of times with no ammo

1401
01:41:41.30 --> 01:41:44.98
How many seconds do you fire with that mesh which made on the in the straight up encounter?

1402
01:41:46.98 --> 01:41:52.58
Three four five seconds something something like that. Yeah, that's still a lot of rounds to receive

1403
01:41:52.82 --> 01:41:55.38
I don't want to be the receiving the 50 cows

1404
01:41:55.38 --> 01:41:59.06
Uh you go on here

1405
01:42:00.98 --> 01:42:05.94
Talking about that straight up encounter you say Eddie Simpson joins up with me both wingman two

1406
01:42:06.34 --> 01:42:11.30
Simpson my old wingman and friend had gotten the one who'd climbed out. This is another aircraft

1407
01:42:12.02 --> 01:42:16.82
We bagged three or four three of the four. We were very excited. It had been a good day

1408
01:42:17.46 --> 01:42:19.70
I had lived and my opponent had died

1409
01:42:20.50 --> 01:42:22.50
But it was a near thing

1410
01:42:22.50 --> 01:42:28.58
It could have been the other way around just as easily and what probably made the difference was the airplane I flew

1411
01:42:29.70 --> 01:42:31.70
Made in America

1412
01:42:32.10 --> 01:42:37.70
I would live to see the day when people would try and tell me that the United States can't make cars like some other folks do

1413
01:42:38.10 --> 01:42:40.10
What a laugh

1414
01:42:40.18 --> 01:42:47.70
I didn't wonder if I just made a new bride a widow or if he might have kids any more than I would have wondered about a snake's

1415
01:42:47.86 --> 01:42:49.86
mate in offspring

1416
01:42:49.86 --> 01:42:55.78
I may have given some thought to how many of my friends he had killed or I might have or he might have killed in the future

1417
01:42:56.02 --> 01:42:58.74
Or how many bombers he might have shot down had he lived

1418
01:42:59.38 --> 01:43:01.38
But that's as far as it went

1419
01:43:01.46 --> 01:43:04.98
From what I could tell he hadn't been overly concerned about me

1420
01:43:06.26 --> 01:43:13.14
People ask about that all the time people usually ask it hesitantly as tactfully as they can but they ask it

1421
01:43:13.62 --> 01:43:18.26
Did I wonder and worry about the mothers and children's and wives of the men I shot down?

1422
01:43:18.26 --> 01:43:21.14
Did I carry any guilt or regret?

1423
01:43:22.90 --> 01:43:24.18
No

1424
01:43:24.18 --> 01:43:26.18
Not then and not now

1425
01:43:27.06 --> 01:43:29.46
World war two was a total thing

1426
01:43:30.18 --> 01:43:35.78
Us against them when being against them was unquestionably the right thing to be

1427
01:43:36.74 --> 01:43:41.38
I flew from my country and was proud I could help in any way that I could

1428
01:43:42.50 --> 01:43:45.46
Besides all of my opponents were trying to kill me

1429
01:43:45.46 --> 01:43:51.22
And frankly I always was elated they hadn't

1430
01:43:52.82 --> 01:43:57.30
This one had almost gotten a beat on me. He'd come as close as anyone would

1431
01:43:58.26 --> 01:43:59.94
When it was done

1432
01:43:59.94 --> 01:44:08.26
480 hours of combat flying in p-51s and another 25 missions are so in vietnam almost all of those in f-105s

1433
01:44:08.74 --> 01:44:11.94
I never once suffered a hit in air-to-air combat

1434
01:44:11.94 --> 01:44:17.94
The sum total of the damage all my aircraft absorbed amounted to one small arms round

1435
01:44:18.26 --> 01:44:22.42
That found one of my wings during a strafing run after d-day

1436
01:44:23.46 --> 01:44:26.34
It bored a hole the size of my little finger

1437
01:44:26.90 --> 01:44:30.58
It didn't even go all the way through just punctured the underside skin

1438
01:44:31.06 --> 01:44:34.90
Nobody noticed it until the next day needing a patch the size of a coin

1439
01:44:35.22 --> 01:44:38.66
That's exactly what my crew used a british shilling

1440
01:44:38.66 --> 01:44:43.86
People on the ground often shot at me flak batteries machine gunners foot soldiers with rifles and pistols

1441
01:44:44.26 --> 01:44:46.98
There may have been some who threw rocks who can say

1442
01:44:47.46 --> 01:44:54.02
But this man on that day was the only opponent who was ever behind me and he couldn't quite bring me into his sights

1443
01:44:54.26 --> 01:44:56.26
And he never did fire

1444
01:44:56.58 --> 01:45:01.38
To my knowledge I was never I never was fired upon by an airplane in combat

1445
01:45:01.94 --> 01:45:04.42
Skill had something to do with that. I suppose

1446
01:45:04.42 --> 01:45:07.78
But there was certainly something more to it than skill

1447
01:45:08.26 --> 01:45:10.26
Lots of hot pilots never came home

1448
01:45:11.06 --> 01:45:13.06
I guess I was lucky

1449
01:45:13.70 --> 01:45:15.70
or blessed

1450
01:45:18.90 --> 01:45:20.90
Yeah, that american made p-51

1451
01:45:22.74 --> 01:45:25.14
Was just next level in the sky, huh?

1452
01:45:25.14 --> 01:45:30.10
When you guys were getting that thing it must have seemed like you know a lot of times for me, you know, I grew up

1453
01:45:30.74 --> 01:45:32.74
I grew up the

1454
01:45:32.74 --> 01:45:36.26
The p-51 was like an antique right it was like an antique thing

1455
01:45:37.14 --> 01:45:39.46
But for you guys this was like a piece of

1456
01:45:40.26 --> 01:45:42.98
The newest technology imaginable

1457
01:45:46.98 --> 01:45:48.50
Just a just an incredible bird

1458
01:45:49.06 --> 01:45:50.58
I mean Dave

1459
01:45:50.58 --> 01:45:55.38
That's like you getting into an f-22 or an f-35 for the first time. It is

1460
01:45:56.42 --> 01:45:58.42
I can't imagine, you know

1461
01:45:58.74 --> 01:46:01.54
Certainly the the prominence of that air is just so much better

1462
01:46:01.54 --> 01:46:05.06
The the prominence of that airplane, but it had to feel good to know

1463
01:46:06.18 --> 01:46:09.46
And I fully appreciate and I'm so glad you wrote about it

1464
01:46:09.46 --> 01:46:13.22
What it always came down to was the man in the in the cockpit. That's the ultimate

1465
01:46:14.10 --> 01:46:16.34
Factor, but it had to feel good to know

1466
01:46:17.14 --> 01:46:19.14
You were getting into an airplane

1467
01:46:19.46 --> 01:46:20.66
That was gonna

1468
01:46:20.66 --> 01:46:25.54
Level the playing field or give you an advantage over what the Germans had so you didn't have to mitigate

1469
01:46:26.18 --> 01:46:28.90
The deficiencies of that p-39 or something else

1470
01:46:28.90 --> 01:46:32.34
It had to be a confidence builder to say if you want to go fight me one to one

1471
01:46:33.46 --> 01:46:37.62
Any in up down left right any environment this airplane will be just fine. So

1472
01:46:38.74 --> 01:46:44.66
That feeling of getting into that p-51 knowing you're going to war had to be a lot better than what you might have been flying in anything else

1473
01:46:45.54 --> 01:46:48.34
And I felt that when I got in my first fight in f-22

1474
01:46:49.22 --> 01:46:50.58
I felt like

1475
01:46:50.58 --> 01:46:54.58
I'll fight anybody anywhere. How did that happen? How did you?

1476
01:46:54.58 --> 01:47:00.02
Be a marine. How would you do that if I can steal a line from your book?

1477
01:47:01.54 --> 01:47:03.54
I was very lucky

1478
01:47:04.02 --> 01:47:10.02
Yeah, a lot of timing a lot of just good fortune a lot of things just aligned the right place right time need

1479
01:47:10.82 --> 01:47:11.54
requirements

1480
01:47:11.54 --> 01:47:17.22
Qualifications and at the end it's really hard for me to take credit for being the only marine that's gotten to do it

1481
01:47:18.18 --> 01:47:22.10
But I was very lucky. You're the only marine that got to fly the f-22 ever

1482
01:47:22.10 --> 01:47:29.86
And the f-35 those marines that fly f-32. Yeah, I was the first marine only only marine to ever fly the raptor

1483
01:47:30.18 --> 01:47:35.46
First marine to fly the f-35 be you know as operational. How'd you get how'd you get in the raptor?

1484
01:47:36.98 --> 01:47:40.50
Short version of a long story the Marine Corps was going to buy

1485
01:47:41.06 --> 01:47:44.34
F-35s is a whole new airplane. They didn't know

1486
01:47:45.14 --> 01:47:48.82
How challenging it would be to go from old to new we hadn't done it in 30 years

1487
01:47:48.82 --> 01:47:54.18
The Air Force had just introduced a new fighter called the f-22 to replace the f-15

1488
01:47:54.90 --> 01:48:00.58
And they basically sent a spy go live with the Air Force for three years and learn all the lessons that they've just learned

1489
01:48:01.14 --> 01:48:03.14
From going from the f-15 to the f-22

1490
01:48:03.54 --> 01:48:08.02
We'll take those lessons and apply it as we replace the f-18s with the f-35

1491
01:48:08.42 --> 01:48:11.54
So I got lucky to be selected for an exchange with the Air Force

1492
01:48:12.02 --> 01:48:18.42
To learn all about the f-22 all about this new generation and all about the challenges of replacing a 30 40 year old

1493
01:48:18.42 --> 01:48:22.90
airplane with the brand new airplane because the marine Corps hadn't done it since the early 80s

1494
01:48:23.62 --> 01:48:27.22
And I was the guy that got to do it and I went straight from the f-22 to the f-35

1495
01:48:28.98 --> 01:48:31.48
Lucky yeah, you two need to play the lottery

1496
01:48:33.86 --> 01:48:40.58
So look I'm I I'm not going to read the whole book. You know, you've got a bunch of other encounters in here

1497
01:48:41.94 --> 01:48:43.94
dogfights

1498
01:48:43.94 --> 01:48:51.46
Incredible detail on the combat experience. You end up with 16 kills 16 and a quarter 16 and a quarter

1499
01:48:51.54 --> 01:48:53.70
That's right. Don't let me leave off that quarter

1500
01:48:54.18 --> 01:48:58.34
What what was the quarter for was the quarter for that one that you just described? Yeah, so there you go

1501
01:48:58.34 --> 01:49:00.34
You got a little bit of that one too

1502
01:49:00.74 --> 01:49:02.74
You end up with 16

1503
01:49:02.74 --> 01:49:06.42
Kills you find you fly your last mission with Jaeger

1504
01:49:07.38 --> 01:49:09.38
You guys are out there together. Okay

1505
01:49:11.70 --> 01:49:13.06
um

1506
01:49:13.06 --> 01:49:17.46
And again people get the book. It's incredible get those details

1507
01:49:18.10 --> 01:49:20.82
But I'm gonna go back. I'm gonna skip forward a little bit here

1508
01:49:21.86 --> 01:49:23.86
and you say

1509
01:49:24.02 --> 01:49:27.30
I hadn't intended to get married. It just kind of happened

1510
01:49:27.94 --> 01:49:32.82
I landed in the states on february 1st 1945 and married my pen pal

1511
01:49:33.70 --> 01:49:38.10
the widow elinor cosby stacker 22 days later

1512
01:49:38.10 --> 01:49:45.38
It took me a few days to get from the east coast to california and I know I asked her at least a week before we got married

1513
01:49:46.66 --> 01:49:52.02
Figure it out. The courtship lasted no more than 10 days to two weeks pretty intense

1514
01:49:53.14 --> 01:49:56.26
We were married three days before chuck and glennis

1515
01:49:57.54 --> 01:50:03.06
It didn't sit all that well with our folks our moms didn't think it would last and you can understand why

1516
01:50:03.06 --> 01:50:08.42
After we've been married about 20 years with our two kids almost grown

1517
01:50:09.14 --> 01:50:15.94
My mother poured it all out to elinor. She told her I thought you'd run home to mama at the first sign of trouble

1518
01:50:16.18 --> 01:50:20.34
I couldn't have been more wrong. You're a wonderful person. They had a good cry

1519
01:50:21.06 --> 01:50:24.34
At another time el's own mother told her the same

1520
01:50:24.90 --> 01:50:31.46
Ellie had been married to jack for two weeks and had mourned 15 months people thought she was vulnerable

1521
01:50:31.46 --> 01:50:33.46
But she knew her own heart

1522
01:50:34.10 --> 01:50:39.94
After 40 plus years. We're still happily married. No question. She's the best thing that ever happened to me

1523
01:50:40.50 --> 01:50:43.30
Over the years. We've seen lots of couples break up

1524
01:50:43.94 --> 01:50:51.78
Loving a fighter pilot is like loving a cop. He leaves work in the morning and you're never entirely sure he will come home at night

1525
01:50:52.66 --> 01:50:54.66
Worse there are inescapable

1526
01:50:54.66 --> 01:51:01.54
Inescapable agonizing periods of separation where the woman has to be both father and mother to the children

1527
01:51:01.78 --> 01:51:05.78
Keep the house together manage the money and contend with the loneliness

1528
01:51:07.46 --> 01:51:09.46
And there never is much money

1529
01:51:09.54 --> 01:51:11.54
But we can look back and laugh now

1530
01:51:11.78 --> 01:51:14.90
Surviving the trials is what brings people closer

1531
01:51:17.62 --> 01:51:21.14
I ended up with 70 years

1532
01:51:21.14 --> 01:51:23.14
She passed away

1533
01:51:28.02 --> 01:51:30.02
And uh

1534
01:51:31.62 --> 01:51:33.62
That's not in the

1535
01:51:34.26 --> 01:51:36.26
That's a updated version, isn't it?

1536
01:51:37.46 --> 01:51:41.46
I'm not sure which version is. I know I have two versions here. Let me see the cover

1537
01:51:41.94 --> 01:51:43.94
The cover to this one

1538
01:51:43.94 --> 01:51:51.38
I think this is the original one. I think this is the updated one. Oh, okay. Yeah, I have both versions

1539
01:51:51.86 --> 01:51:55.46
Well, actually one of them's dave's version that he's had for 20 years or something

1540
01:51:56.42 --> 01:52:00.42
What can I say about that the storybook romance, right? Right?

1541
01:52:02.34 --> 01:52:04.34
No, it's um and then well

1542
01:52:05.06 --> 01:52:09.06
What was like coming home and you I didn't mention this. It's in the book

1543
01:52:09.06 --> 01:52:14.58
I came home for a little bit of leave in between and you got treated like the biggest hero in the history of America. Yeah

1544
01:52:16.34 --> 01:52:18.34
Which is awesome

1545
01:52:19.46 --> 01:52:21.46
But when you're now you come home again

1546
01:52:22.34 --> 01:52:25.14
For good for for good so to speak

1547
01:52:25.70 --> 01:52:29.46
Well, yeah, what you didn't know it would be for good. Maybe you would be going to japan or whatever

1548
01:52:30.10 --> 01:52:34.02
But germany surrendered while you were back in america, right and

1549
01:52:34.02 --> 01:52:38.58
So so how did that feel? Did you feel like we did it?

1550
01:52:39.86 --> 01:52:41.30
I've

1551
01:52:41.30 --> 01:52:43.30
I was pretty elated

1552
01:52:43.30 --> 01:52:44.58
mm-hmm

1553
01:52:44.58 --> 01:52:49.62
And you mentioned this in the book and I think it's definitely worth talking about so

1554
01:52:50.66 --> 01:52:52.66
The 357th

1555
01:52:52.82 --> 01:52:56.58
Who you are part of shot down 609 enemy aircraft

1556
01:52:57.78 --> 01:52:59.78
13 died in training

1557
01:52:59.78 --> 01:53:07.14
57 were killed in combat and that was from 16 accidents and then the others were killed in shot

1558
01:53:08.18 --> 01:53:10.18
And there was 71

1559
01:53:10.58 --> 01:53:12.02
POWs

1560
01:53:12.02 --> 01:53:13.86
taken

1561
01:53:13.86 --> 01:53:17.54
You had 28 original pilots in your crew in your group

1562
01:53:18.34 --> 01:53:22.42
Nine of whom were killed seven of whom were shot down and became POWs

1563
01:53:24.02 --> 01:53:26.02
Yeah 50 percent

1564
01:53:26.02 --> 01:53:28.02
Oh

1565
01:53:29.22 --> 01:53:31.62
You must have felt very lucky to be home

1566
01:53:33.62 --> 01:53:34.98
Um

1567
01:53:34.98 --> 01:53:40.42
But then it's like you're you're looking at japan, right? You had to be looking at japan like everybody else. Yeah

1568
01:53:40.98 --> 01:53:42.98
It was always there. Yeah

1569
01:53:43.14 --> 01:53:46.90
But but you ended up going to texas and did you become a flight instructor?

1570
01:53:47.86 --> 01:53:52.26
Was that your job in texas? Yeah, but I had a lot of group, you know

1571
01:53:53.46 --> 01:53:54.58
um

1572
01:53:54.58 --> 01:53:56.58
I had a group of instructors

1573
01:53:57.78 --> 01:53:59.78
and uh, I'm the I'm the

1574
01:54:00.74 --> 01:54:02.74
group commander

1575
01:54:03.06 --> 01:54:05.30
And I ride the I have to ride the

1576
01:54:06.58 --> 01:54:08.58
I go to the

1577
01:54:09.70 --> 01:54:14.82
Instructor school the central instructor school then come back

1578
01:54:16.26 --> 01:54:19.78
And they only let me write do the wash rides

1579
01:54:20.42 --> 01:54:22.42
What's a what's a wash ride?

1580
01:54:22.42 --> 01:54:24.42
Tell a guy he's not gonna

1581
01:54:25.30 --> 01:54:27.30
Make it. Oh, you're washing him out

1582
01:54:27.46 --> 01:54:29.46
guys

1583
01:54:30.42 --> 01:54:32.42
Uh, and then it's

1584
01:54:32.42 --> 01:54:37.70
Next thing happens is so you're there working as an instructor and the next thing happens is vj day

1585
01:54:38.50 --> 01:54:42.18
Yeah, and now the war is over. Yeah

1586
01:54:45.14 --> 01:54:50.18
What was it what was the uh state what was the mindset of america on vj day?

1587
01:54:50.18 --> 01:54:52.18
Uh just

1588
01:54:53.86 --> 01:54:58.50
I don't know how to explain it but uh extreme joy

1589
01:54:59.94 --> 01:55:02.44
And I don't think there's any remorse

1590
01:55:05.94 --> 01:55:13.38
From a service man that served in that time about the use of the atomic bomb

1591
01:55:15.38 --> 01:55:17.38
And I really

1592
01:55:17.46 --> 01:55:19.06
true when

1593
01:55:19.06 --> 01:55:22.02
He he did a good job. Yeah. Yeah

1594
01:55:23.14 --> 01:55:28.10
No doubt about that and especially when you hear the stories from the guys that fought in the pacific

1595
01:55:28.82 --> 01:55:33.46
On the ground against the japanese. I mean it was going to be absolutely

1596
01:55:34.66 --> 01:55:37.62
horrendous if we had to go into mainland japan

1597
01:55:38.98 --> 01:55:40.98
yeah, and

1598
01:55:41.62 --> 01:55:45.54
You know, they were we know they were training their kids

1599
01:55:45.54 --> 01:55:48.66
and the women to fight with sticks

1600
01:55:49.94 --> 01:55:51.94
and hiding caves

1601
01:55:53.06 --> 01:55:55.06
And

1602
01:55:56.26 --> 01:56:04.74
We would have just wiped them out. Yeah, we would kill more japanese and then

1603
01:56:07.06 --> 01:56:09.06
Americans, yeah

1604
01:56:10.90 --> 01:56:12.26
Um

1605
01:56:12.26 --> 01:56:17.54
So now that the war is over you you go and become a recruiter going for going recruiting duty

1606
01:56:18.34 --> 01:56:20.34
Everybody's getting out

1607
01:56:21.94 --> 01:56:22.82
Uh

1608
01:56:22.82 --> 01:56:26.82
Yeager becomes a test pilot and it seems like he eventually recruits

1609
01:56:26.98 --> 01:56:34.34
Basically recruits you to become a test pilot. Well, he allowed me to he got me a interview with the head of a flight test

1610
01:56:35.70 --> 01:56:37.22
Uh

1611
01:56:37.22 --> 01:56:42.66
You got a cool section in here during these test pilots a year test pilot years. Um

1612
01:56:44.34 --> 01:56:46.74
Scary scary and I kind of wanted to

1613
01:56:47.62 --> 01:56:52.90
Bring out the fact of what it was like being a test pilot because it was risky business back then

1614
01:56:53.86 --> 01:56:57.22
Um, this section here you say on april 24th

1615
01:56:58.82 --> 01:57:04.58
1953 we took off in rendezvous with the b29 and a couple of chase planes at 25 000 feet

1616
01:57:04.58 --> 01:57:10.58
In the chase aircraft were jake knight and bill ross the pilot scheduled to join john on the project

1617
01:57:11.06 --> 01:57:13.06
I moved in on the b29

1618
01:57:13.30 --> 01:57:19.54
Hooked onto its wingtip and again the dash panel light remained dark. No power damn

1619
01:57:20.42 --> 01:57:22.42
Thoroughly frustrated by now

1620
01:57:22.42 --> 01:57:27.62
I disconnected moved away from the mothership and davis moved in and hooked up

1621
01:57:27.62 --> 01:57:31.38
So this was what you were trying to do what what we were trying to do as a country

1622
01:57:31.38 --> 01:57:40.74
was get away to make the fighters be able to support the bombers longer and they devised some kind of system where you could actually take two fighter planes

1623
01:57:41.54 --> 01:57:48.26
And hook into the wings of a big giant bomber that has a bunch of fuel and they're they would kind of pull you along

1624
01:57:50.18 --> 01:57:52.18
Well, that that was one

1625
01:57:53.54 --> 01:57:55.54
one um

1626
01:57:57.54 --> 01:57:59.54
Concept that uh

1627
01:57:59.54 --> 01:58:01.54
People latched on to

1628
01:58:02.42 --> 01:58:04.42
but the basic program

1629
01:58:05.94 --> 01:58:11.70
Was a theory by this german engineer that we brought back from world war two

1630
01:58:14.26 --> 01:58:16.58
Uh to work work in right field

1631
01:58:19.14 --> 01:58:22.10
And he theorized that you take a

1632
01:58:23.22 --> 01:58:25.22
bomber

1633
01:58:25.22 --> 01:58:32.58
If you could put a wing extension out here just a wing extension

1634
01:58:33.14 --> 01:58:35.14
And you had some way of controlling it

1635
01:58:36.10 --> 01:58:38.10
You increase the aspect ratio

1636
01:58:39.30 --> 01:58:42.02
And that give you longer range

1637
01:58:44.18 --> 01:58:50.74
And so they wanted to do it in a wind tunnel but they didn't have the priority and all that stuff so

1638
01:58:52.26 --> 01:58:53.86
uh

1639
01:58:53.86 --> 01:58:55.86
I said well, let's

1640
01:58:56.26 --> 01:58:58.26
Let's try it with airplanes

1641
01:58:59.78 --> 01:59:02.90
Well, that was okay except we haven't done that before

1642
01:59:04.50 --> 01:59:10.74
And so that's why we developed the program with a c-47 and a little q-14

1643
01:59:12.66 --> 01:59:15.54
And with a uh simple

1644
01:59:15.54 --> 01:59:22.66
Locking mechanism like back again back again to it

1645
01:59:23.94 --> 01:59:27.30
And then the drag would hold us it was a beveled ring

1646
01:59:28.50 --> 01:59:32.66
Then we had a bevel ball with a with a dump bevel

1647
01:59:33.46 --> 01:59:35.46
with a spike

1648
01:59:35.46 --> 01:59:38.66
And it you had to go in front of it back end

1649
01:59:40.18 --> 01:59:42.18
Which made about twice as hard

1650
01:59:43.30 --> 01:59:44.98
and then

1651
01:59:44.98 --> 01:59:46.82
it was

1652
01:59:46.82 --> 01:59:48.82
locked when you pulled the throttle back

1653
01:59:50.10 --> 01:59:52.10
But then if you wanted to get out just

1654
01:59:52.82 --> 01:59:54.82
have throttle to it

1655
01:59:55.22 --> 01:59:59.38
So as you're trying to do this you're you try bringing your plane in you connect

1656
01:59:59.38 --> 02:00:01.38
But you're not getting the full connection

1657
02:00:02.02 --> 02:00:07.94
And so then i'm going back to the book autopilot coming on he radioed so this is after davis moved in and hooked up

1658
02:00:08.18 --> 02:00:12.50
This is a completely different project. Okay. Yeah, so what project is this one?

1659
02:00:12.50 --> 02:00:14.50
This was

1660
02:00:15.46 --> 02:00:22.58
Using two f-84s two airplanes one on each wing that was going to be the panel right

1661
02:00:23.86 --> 02:00:27.14
And we hadn't gone through the manual flying of it

1662
02:00:28.66 --> 02:00:30.34
and

1663
02:00:30.34 --> 02:00:33.14
Done enough to give them confidence

1664
02:00:34.42 --> 02:00:36.58
to go to an automatic pilot

1665
02:00:36.58 --> 02:00:40.74
And uh, meanwhile i'd been

1666
02:00:42.58 --> 02:00:44.58
Sorry

1667
02:00:44.58 --> 02:00:46.58
I'd been uh

1668
02:00:47.70 --> 02:00:50.34
I'd been there about five years which was

1669
02:00:51.46 --> 02:00:53.46
way more than normal

1670
02:00:53.78 --> 02:00:55.78
and uh

1671
02:00:56.50 --> 02:01:00.50
I wanted to stay there and I told him I say this project's coming up

1672
02:01:00.50 --> 02:01:08.74
Uh, the only other guy that can do it is john davis. He's been flying along but just flying

1673
02:01:08.98 --> 02:01:10.98
I flew the data ship

1674
02:01:11.30 --> 02:01:15.70
That got all the data on you know angles and speeds and

1675
02:01:16.82 --> 02:01:20.02
And john was flying another airplane manually

1676
02:01:21.14 --> 02:01:23.14
Just a standard fighter

1677
02:01:25.54 --> 02:01:27.94
And so I could never get power

1678
02:01:27.94 --> 02:01:30.74
This was something like the fifth

1679
02:01:32.02 --> 02:01:34.02
fifth time

1680
02:01:34.50 --> 02:01:36.50
and

1681
02:01:37.22 --> 02:01:43.14
Everybody was getting nervous, you know, they wanted progress

1682
02:01:45.70 --> 02:01:52.74
Look and the contractor was a low bidder on the autopilot

1683
02:01:55.22 --> 02:01:57.22
um

1684
02:01:57.22 --> 02:02:00.42
And I'm in the Pentagon now. I got a new boss

1685
02:02:01.30 --> 02:02:04.50
And he's pissed off at me because I'm going away flying

1686
02:02:05.22 --> 02:02:06.98
They ask him

1687
02:02:06.98 --> 02:02:08.74
To let me go

1688
02:02:08.74 --> 02:02:10.74
I should have told them a stick it was

1689
02:02:12.02 --> 02:02:14.02
So they didn't they didn't see much

1690
02:02:15.30 --> 02:02:20.10
Desire and keeping me there when I was when I knew this was coming up

1691
02:02:20.10 --> 02:02:27.94
But they want the most experienced guy to make the first few flights and then turn it over to

1692
02:02:29.70 --> 02:02:31.70
Check out some other guys

1693
02:02:32.50 --> 02:02:34.50
and uh

1694
02:02:35.94 --> 02:02:40.26
Now you're you're you're you're coming up on the bad part. Yeah, so

1695
02:02:41.14 --> 02:02:44.90
So basically you had gone in to try and see if you could get it to work

1696
02:02:45.38 --> 02:02:48.50
It didn't work. You didn't get the connection. You didn't get the um

1697
02:02:48.50 --> 02:02:55.14
The power that you were supposed to get when you connected up to the bomber. Yeah, and so you break off

1698
02:02:56.10 --> 02:02:59.54
and then davis comes in and he hooks up

1699
02:03:00.50 --> 02:03:06.34
And and he I'll go to the book now autopilot coming on he radioed and I knew he would be trying to

1700
02:03:06.74 --> 02:03:10.02
Set some kind of record for turning a switch on and off

1701
02:03:11.22 --> 02:03:12.82
And then his airplane

1702
02:03:12.82 --> 02:03:19.06
abruptly pitched up and over and smashed upside down onto the wing of the b29

1703
02:03:20.90 --> 02:03:27.46
I saw the explosive bolts of fire if a certain angle between the wings works was exceeded

1704
02:03:27.94 --> 02:03:32.18
They were to fire automatically blowing the connection apart, but it didn't matter

1705
02:03:33.14 --> 02:03:35.14
It all happened too fast

1706
02:03:35.22 --> 02:03:40.26
the spasm reaction of an autopilot far out of phase through the f84

1707
02:03:40.26 --> 02:03:44.58
Over onto the bomber like the cover of a book slammed shut

1708
02:03:46.34 --> 02:03:49.54
There was no time for anything not even a call on the radio

1709
02:03:50.74 --> 02:03:53.94
The outer panel of the bomber's left wing peeled upward

1710
02:03:54.42 --> 02:03:58.26
From the wingtip almost to the outboard engine and then the f

1711
02:03:58.90 --> 02:04:03.94
f84 fell against the main spar the impact sheared the jets nose away

1712
02:04:03.94 --> 02:04:09.70
Cleanly just in front of the cockpit the fighter bounced off and fell away in a glide

1713
02:04:09.94 --> 02:04:13.30
I remember yelling for john to get out, but I got no response

1714
02:04:15.06 --> 02:04:18.10
The bomber nosed over and with the most

1715
02:04:18.90 --> 02:04:21.38
With most of the wing gone fell into

1716
02:04:22.26 --> 02:04:26.18
big power spiral and augered almost straight in

1717
02:04:27.54 --> 02:04:32.34
It wouldn't have been the simplest thing in the world to get out of pointed almost straight down inspiring

1718
02:04:32.34 --> 02:04:37.86
And spiraling tightly and pressurized which would have made getting a door open even more difficult

1719
02:04:38.42 --> 02:04:44.26
Earlier flights had been flown without pressurizing the cabin guarding against exactly this sort of incident

1720
02:04:45.14 --> 02:04:47.62
But everything had gone so well flight after flight

1721
02:04:48.18 --> 02:04:53.70
That's somewhere along the line the b29 crew had decided such precautions weren't necessary

1722
02:04:53.70 --> 02:05:01.46
In the final seconds just before the bomber crashed into the bay one of the crew of five struggled free

1723
02:05:02.26 --> 02:05:07.54
But he was too low by the by then and there wasn't enough time for his parachute to come all the way open

1724
02:05:08.82 --> 02:05:13.70
Moments later the fighter burrowed into a forest throwing up a huge fireball

1725
02:05:13.70 --> 02:05:25.38
Six men were dead one a close friend because engineers programming the autopilot had erroneously assumed the b29's wing to be rigid

1726
02:05:26.02 --> 02:05:28.66
And because there wasn't an instrument to warn us of

1727
02:05:29.46 --> 02:05:32.50
To warn us how out of phase the autopilot might be

1728
02:05:33.06 --> 02:05:39.46
And because there were too many people involved in the project and because everybody was probably too much in too much of a hurry

1729
02:05:39.46 --> 02:05:46.18
And because no one had fought up computers which probably could have worked out out the settings

1730
02:05:46.50 --> 02:05:50.58
And because of Curtis LeMay had said keep working on it

1731
02:05:50.82 --> 02:05:58.58
And of course because I hadn't said it's too damn tough at a time when saying it was almost certainly would have killed the project

1732
02:06:00.58 --> 02:06:07.78
In war when death is all around a man can steal himself against it block out the heartbreak press on

1733
02:06:07.78 --> 02:06:12.18
But this wasn't wartime and maybe I'd let my guard down

1734
02:06:12.98 --> 02:06:17.94
Maybe of all the things that have happened to me in my life. This probably hit me the hardest

1735
02:06:19.22 --> 02:06:21.22
I was a long time getting over it

1736
02:06:22.02 --> 02:06:26.98
John Davis was dead and it could have been me probably should have been me

1737
02:06:26.98 --> 02:06:35.78
We never did learn why I couldn't draw power from the b29's

1738
02:06:38.90 --> 02:06:42.10
So, um horrible incident

1739
02:06:43.14 --> 02:06:45.14
Yeah, I have to say

1740
02:06:46.18 --> 02:06:48.18
that uh

1741
02:06:49.22 --> 02:06:51.22
In all of my 30 years

1742
02:06:52.66 --> 02:06:54.66
of service

1743
02:06:54.66 --> 02:06:56.82
The hardest thing I had to do

1744
02:06:58.90 --> 02:07:00.90
Was

1745
02:07:02.74 --> 02:07:05.22
Drive back into the housing section

1746
02:07:06.98 --> 02:07:08.98
and tell a

1747
02:07:09.22 --> 02:07:12.66
widow that her husband's not coming back tonight

1748
02:07:15.78 --> 02:07:17.78
I just uh

1749
02:07:17.78 --> 02:07:24.10
I had to do that so many times you'd think I would have coped with it, but

1750
02:07:25.94 --> 02:07:27.94
Somehow rather I just

1751
02:07:28.42 --> 02:07:30.42
Was very difficult for me to do

1752
02:07:32.98 --> 02:07:34.66
Well, there's uh

1753
02:07:34.66 --> 02:07:40.50
You know you talk about this in the book. There's a one point where someone comes comes. There's so many accidents happening

1754
02:07:40.98 --> 02:07:42.02
someone

1755
02:07:42.02 --> 02:07:44.02
comes to do an assessment

1756
02:07:44.26 --> 02:07:45.78
of the

1757
02:07:45.78 --> 02:07:47.62
the program

1758
02:07:47.62 --> 02:07:52.66
And they say there's no evidence of a safety program at edwards like it didn't even exist

1759
02:07:56.02 --> 02:07:59.78
And and actually david and I were talking about this you you eventually got tasked with

1760
02:08:00.26 --> 02:08:02.50
creating a the safety program there

1761
02:08:03.22 --> 02:08:08.42
And david and I were talking about the term buying the farm which everybody knows what buying the farm is

1762
02:08:08.50 --> 02:08:11.54
But I think we found the root of that in your book

1763
02:08:11.54 --> 02:08:18.02
Was that you guys used to say if you if you die then your your widow is going to get a $10,000 insurance policy

1764
02:08:18.02 --> 02:08:23.06
Which is enough to buy the farm or buy whatever you want. So that's where that from from what I know

1765
02:08:23.06 --> 02:08:26.10
That's where that term comes from exactly buying the farm

1766
02:08:26.82 --> 02:08:28.82
but you get tasked with

1767
02:08:29.38 --> 02:08:31.38
coming up with that safety program

1768
02:08:32.98 --> 02:08:34.66
And

1769
02:08:34.66 --> 02:08:42.02
You know you're you're you're at how long are you at that test pilot program for forever. It's a long time. You got

1770
02:08:42.18 --> 02:08:45.70
You got a pretty good story about about uh, yeager in here

1771
02:08:46.74 --> 02:08:48.74
I kind of got to read this one

1772
02:08:49.38 --> 02:08:53.70
Uh, you you're going to again, there's some background and I'm skipping through the book

1773
02:08:53.78 --> 02:08:58.82
So buy the book to get the details chuck was involved in the testing and on one of the flights

1774
02:08:58.82 --> 02:09:04.02
This in late 1963. I was practicing instruments in a t33

1775
02:09:04.26 --> 02:09:09.86
Just happened to be in the air listening on the radio when chucks chase plane had a problem and had to abort

1776
02:09:10.50 --> 02:09:12.50
I piped up and said hey, I'm available

1777
02:09:13.22 --> 02:09:18.26
All a chase pilot does is follow as far as he can and then pick the man up coming back

1778
02:09:18.58 --> 02:09:22.18
And stand by to help if he's needed. So you're out there just doing a normal flight

1779
02:09:22.58 --> 02:09:27.30
Chuck's doing some kind of a test flight and his the person that's supposed to be observing him

1780
02:09:27.30 --> 02:09:32.50
Something happens to his plane. Yeah, so yeah, so you say hey, I'm I'm up here. I got it

1781
02:09:33.70 --> 02:09:40.18
As I circled in the general area where the nf 104 would return to my altitude. I listened and watched

1782
02:09:40.90 --> 02:09:42.90
Chuck made a level run

1783
02:09:42.98 --> 02:09:46.26
Then lifted the 104s nose and touched off its rocket

1784
02:09:46.66 --> 02:09:50.58
Blasting almost straight up leaving a trail that could easily be seen

1785
02:09:51.46 --> 02:09:55.62
At 100,000 feet. I learned later the 104s nose pitched up

1786
02:09:55.62 --> 02:10:01.30
Which was always a danger in the starfighter when you ran out of speed and reached a certain critical angle

1787
02:10:02.02 --> 02:10:07.22
A device made the stick actually shaking your hand to warn you as you approached this angle of attack

1788
02:10:07.70 --> 02:10:13.30
And if you didn't correct then a stick pusher would move the nose down automatically

1789
02:10:14.02 --> 02:10:16.98
Instead of stalling at this angle the 104 would pitch up

1790
02:10:17.38 --> 02:10:22.34
Gyrate around and fall into a spin you could recover from if you had enough altitude

1791
02:10:22.34 --> 02:10:29.38
Only this time the air was too thin for maneuvering and the small thrusters didn't have enough power to force the nose down

1792
02:10:30.10 --> 02:10:32.90
Chuck's plane fell into what became a flat spin

1793
02:10:33.38 --> 02:10:38.74
Bellied down like a frisbee the kind of spin you can almost forget getting out of

1794
02:10:39.78 --> 02:10:42.82
He tried everything to book in the book to recover

1795
02:10:43.46 --> 02:10:48.58
He even popped the landing drag shoot trying to get the nose down with no luck

1796
02:10:48.58 --> 02:10:55.70
I followed him down from 25,000 feet circling his spinning aircraft as we reached 10,000

1797
02:10:55.86 --> 02:10:57.86
I was yelling for him to get out

1798
02:10:58.34 --> 02:11:03.86
He fired the rocket powered ejection seat and while I was calling for the chopper to fly out and get him

1799
02:11:04.34 --> 02:11:06.34
I watched his parachute billo

1800
02:11:07.46 --> 02:11:10.34
I came over low as he landed to see if he was all right

1801
02:11:11.14 --> 02:11:14.50
He was lying down and as I flew by he waved

1802
02:11:14.50 --> 02:11:20.26
The way he was lying seemed awkward, but I wrote that off to the cumbersome spacesuit

1803
02:11:21.46 --> 02:11:24.26
I came by again and he was standing up waving

1804
02:11:25.06 --> 02:11:28.66
I circled until the chopper arrived and took him off to the hospital

1805
02:11:29.78 --> 02:11:31.78
I was stunned to learn he'd been burned

1806
02:11:32.58 --> 02:11:36.90
By the time I got to the hospital his head was swollen as large as a basketball

1807
02:11:37.54 --> 02:11:41.38
As he'd ejected the seat had become fouled in his parachute lines

1808
02:11:41.38 --> 02:11:46.10
And the pull of his shoot popping open had slammed the seat into chuck

1809
02:11:47.46 --> 02:11:54.66
The still hot rocket attached to its underside hit him smack in the face splitting open his helmet his helmet's face plate

1810
02:11:54.98 --> 02:11:59.46
The spent rocket was still spitting some flame and it flashed inside his

1811
02:11:59.86 --> 02:12:07.22
Split helmet fueled by Chuck's oxygen. He managed to get the face plate open which shut off the oxygen or it might have been worse

1812
02:12:07.22 --> 02:12:11.62
As it was his glove caught fire and his face was badly seared

1813
02:12:12.18 --> 02:12:14.18
The doctors had to peel away the skin

1814
02:12:14.82 --> 02:12:21.06
Daily for weeks. It must have hurt like hell. You can still see the scars though. You have to look closely

1815
02:12:23.14 --> 02:12:27.70
So that's a day in the life of the dang fighter test pilots back then

1816
02:12:31.14 --> 02:12:34.66
Uh just kind of crazy stuff you guys were doing

1817
02:12:34.66 --> 02:12:38.10
Well the cold order was still on

1818
02:12:40.18 --> 02:12:42.34
But what he was doing was uh

1819
02:12:45.22 --> 02:12:48.26
Trying to set out a new official

1820
02:12:51.70 --> 02:12:53.70
Speed uh

1821
02:12:54.34 --> 02:12:59.86
Time to climb record and that was especially modified

1822
02:12:59.86 --> 02:13:07.46
Uh F104 that they were going to try to use in the test pilot school. He was

1823
02:13:08.58 --> 02:13:11.94
Running the test pilot school at that time. So

1824
02:13:12.98 --> 02:13:16.18
He was doing some of his own flight testing but

1825
02:13:18.10 --> 02:13:21.94
We had already flown the airplane to 100 and

1826
02:13:21.94 --> 02:13:28.58
120 something thousand feet and uh

1827
02:13:30.26 --> 02:13:35.30
What space isn't space 50,000 feet the what how how how high up is space?

1828
02:13:37.06 --> 02:13:39.54
I forget what there there is an official

1829
02:13:40.90 --> 02:13:44.90
Yeah, I think it's probably closer to 80 80,000. It's definitely above 50. I've been to 60

1830
02:13:44.90 --> 02:13:51.78
Oh, we're just kind of laughable by these standards. It's not space. Is this the scene is this the scene that they show in the in the book

1831
02:13:52.10 --> 02:13:54.26
Or in the movie the right stuff and in the book the right stuff

1832
02:13:54.82 --> 02:13:58.66
This this scene right here. Are you familiar with that movie the right stuff? Yeah

1833
02:13:59.38 --> 02:14:01.22
Is this what they when they portray?

1834
02:14:01.22 --> 02:14:04.42
Jaeger crashing and he comes walking out of the fire

1835
02:14:05.22 --> 02:14:08.82
And the guy says now, what is that? That's a man

1836
02:14:08.82 --> 02:14:13.22
I forgot that

1837
02:14:18.58 --> 02:14:20.66
So you spend this time out there

1838
02:14:21.30 --> 02:14:23.30
um eventually you get signed

1839
02:14:24.18 --> 02:14:25.54
to the

1840
02:14:25.54 --> 02:14:30.58
In like 1965 you get assigned to the 18th tactical fighter wing. This is an oka now

1841
02:14:31.94 --> 02:14:33.62
Your son meanwhile

1842
02:14:33.62 --> 02:14:35.94
Jim goes to the Air Force Academy. Yeah

1843
02:14:35.94 --> 02:14:41.22
So I guess he was he was following his father's footsteps. How'd you feel about that?

1844
02:14:42.18 --> 02:14:46.02
I was really proud of him. I am proud of him

1845
02:14:49.38 --> 02:14:51.38
He's a real good guy

1846
02:14:52.90 --> 02:14:57.78
That's uh, that's a pretty amazing story. I took him for a ride in uh

1847
02:14:59.62 --> 02:15:01.62
F105 he came to okinawa

1848
02:15:01.62 --> 02:15:07.22
Oh, okay. Wait, how old was he when he went for riding on a 105?

1849
02:15:08.98 --> 02:15:10.82
Oh

1850
02:15:10.82 --> 02:15:16.18
I forget what the academy. Oh, so he was at the academy. Yeah, he was a cadet

1851
02:15:19.70 --> 02:15:21.70
And then of course later on

1852
02:15:23.70 --> 02:15:25.70
He took me on a combat machine

1853
02:15:25.70 --> 02:15:31.62
Okay, well go ahead and tell us that story. I think we already did well. We weren't hit we hadn't hit record yet

1854
02:15:32.02 --> 02:15:34.90
And I was only catching pieces of it because I was getting set up

1855
02:15:35.54 --> 02:15:40.18
So what happened? How'd you end up doing a combat mission with your son in vietnam? Well?

1856
02:15:41.22 --> 02:15:43.70
He when he got out of flying school

1857
02:15:45.22 --> 02:15:47.22
He wanted to go to fighters

1858
02:15:49.14 --> 02:15:52.66
No, I had B 52's, you know

1859
02:15:52.66 --> 02:15:54.66
Long down

1860
02:15:54.98 --> 02:16:00.98
And so he finally decided well if I can't get fighters I might as well go to vietnam

1861
02:16:02.26 --> 02:16:05.70
So he went to a special operation squadron

1862
02:16:07.46 --> 02:16:09.46
This was on the

1863
02:16:09.78 --> 02:16:11.78
choose list

1864
02:16:12.02 --> 02:16:14.02
And flying an old two

1865
02:16:15.22 --> 02:16:17.38
Which is a push puller

1866
02:16:17.38 --> 02:16:20.90
Uh, a Cessna 337

1867
02:16:22.02 --> 02:16:24.50
standard 337 modified for

1868
02:16:26.18 --> 02:16:28.18
special operations and

1869
02:16:30.10 --> 02:16:37.14
Then shortly after he got there I got assigned to talk Lee in thailand

1870
02:16:38.66 --> 02:16:40.66
105s

1871
02:16:40.98 --> 02:16:43.22
in the sassy Asian war

1872
02:16:45.06 --> 02:16:46.90
and

1873
02:16:46.90 --> 02:16:51.54
The seventh air force was having a all commanders

1874
02:16:53.30 --> 02:16:55.30
Meeting in in Saigon

1875
02:16:57.22 --> 02:17:01.46
And so he'd live he was at benoise so right next door

1876
02:17:02.66 --> 02:17:06.90
So I called him and I said hey, maybe we could get together, you know

1877
02:17:08.10 --> 02:17:10.50
And then he comes back with

1878
02:17:12.02 --> 02:17:14.42
Hey, you want to go into combat mission with me?

1879
02:17:14.42 --> 02:17:16.42
I

1880
02:17:16.42 --> 02:17:18.42
Says you got to be kidding

1881
02:17:19.30 --> 02:17:22.66
You'll never get that permission to do that

1882
02:17:24.50 --> 02:17:28.82
And I certainly would not have permitted it in my wing

1883
02:17:30.66 --> 02:17:36.42
And uh, so he says stand by and on he's a new guy

1884
02:17:38.18 --> 02:17:40.18
And stand by

1885
02:17:40.18 --> 02:17:46.18
And he's gonna come back all it seemed like a minute later. He says it's all set

1886
02:17:48.02 --> 02:17:50.02
He says

1887
02:17:51.46 --> 02:17:53.70
You you come on down to Saigon

1888
02:17:55.54 --> 02:17:57.54
I'll pick you up the next morning

1889
02:17:58.58 --> 02:18:02.90
We'll go on a combat mission land at benoise spend the night

1890
02:18:03.70 --> 02:18:05.70
And then I'll get you back to your

1891
02:18:05.70 --> 02:18:09.54
Your baby, you know Saigon meeting

1892
02:18:10.82 --> 02:18:12.82
So sure enough

1893
02:18:14.18 --> 02:18:21.62
It happens but special operations they do all kinds of stuff and

1894
02:18:25.22 --> 02:18:28.18
So he probably picked a

1895
02:18:29.70 --> 02:18:32.74
Minimum risk kind of a project

1896
02:18:32.74 --> 02:18:35.86
We we went out the

1897
02:18:38.66 --> 02:18:40.66
The

1898
02:18:42.10 --> 02:18:45.22
The O2 had a loud speaker on it

1899
02:18:47.22 --> 02:18:50.74
And they'd go out over communist strongholds and

1900
02:18:52.98 --> 02:18:54.98
Publish a

1901
02:18:56.58 --> 02:18:58.58
Speak

1902
02:18:58.58 --> 02:19:04.18
Most stuff like oh hit him with some psyops some psychological operations. Yeah, that's what I was trying to think

1903
02:19:05.46 --> 02:19:09.30
And then we'd go back over the area and

1904
02:19:11.54 --> 02:19:15.06
Drop leaflets which gave them safe passage

1905
02:19:16.10 --> 02:19:21.86
They could go and you know go up and surrender with it and we would take them up as a

1906
02:19:23.62 --> 02:19:25.62
Personer with no

1907
02:19:25.62 --> 02:19:28.34
Would then kill them. Um

1908
02:19:31.22 --> 02:19:36.66
Well, I'm glad that that approval chain didn't go through your wife because she was not very happy

1909
02:19:38.66 --> 02:19:41.86
I I I carry this story

1910
02:19:43.62 --> 02:19:46.10
I'm a little overkill when I do it, you know

1911
02:19:47.38 --> 02:19:52.50
Oh, you know, I can't I don't have the words I can't describe

1912
02:19:52.50 --> 02:19:56.74
What it means to me to be able to fly with my

1913
02:19:57.70 --> 02:20:01.22
Son in a combat mission. I certainly wouldn't let anybody

1914
02:20:01.94 --> 02:20:03.94
Do it in my organization

1915
02:20:05.22 --> 02:20:07.22
and

1916
02:20:08.18 --> 02:20:13.62
Then I go on I say but my word my wife had a few words to say about it

1917
02:20:14.58 --> 02:20:17.94
She's damn glad she didn't know about it until it was all over

1918
02:20:17.94 --> 02:20:19.94
I

1919
02:20:20.66 --> 02:20:22.26
Um

1920
02:20:22.26 --> 02:20:26.26
Yeah, speaking of like flying with your friends and whatnot

1921
02:20:26.82 --> 02:20:28.82
Uh, you had a little reunion

1922
02:20:29.46 --> 02:20:33.14
In vietnam as well. Here's another one. You got chuck. Yeager chuck said well

1923
02:20:33.14 --> 02:20:39.70
We flew our last combat mission in world war two together. We might as well fly our first combat mission in southeast asia together

1924
02:20:40.58 --> 02:20:45.06
That morning we served as a crew for one of several bombers on a close support mission

1925
02:20:45.06 --> 02:20:49.22
Making one run after another over an endless green jungle

1926
02:20:49.78 --> 02:20:52.98
A forward air controller on the ground with a radio gave us targets

1927
02:20:53.46 --> 02:20:58.26
And we dive in 30 degrees pretty steep for a plane of that size toggle away a single bomb

1928
02:20:58.34 --> 02:21:05.06
Then fly back around and let go another over and over again ever so carefully trying to put them right where the troops wanted them

1929
02:21:05.06 --> 02:21:13.54
Again we stayed the night and partied with friends. So you got to do ops with with Yeager again in vietnam

1930
02:21:18.18 --> 02:21:20.66
Eventually you end up with um

1931
02:21:22.02 --> 02:21:27.38
Eventually you end up with the you become the commander of the 355th tactical fighter wing

1932
02:21:28.50 --> 02:21:30.74
And you're flying the f105

1933
02:21:30.74 --> 02:21:34.18
Uh funder chief which dav told me

1934
02:21:35.22 --> 02:21:37.22
Is is called the thud

1935
02:21:38.10 --> 02:21:40.10
And how'd you like that bird?

1936
02:21:40.82 --> 02:21:46.90
Well, you I don't know what thud means. Oh, okay. Dave gave me some bad intelligence. You didn't call it thud

1937
02:21:51.38 --> 02:21:53.38
Now it got that name from

1938
02:21:54.50 --> 02:21:56.02
crashes

1939
02:21:56.02 --> 02:22:01.22
In the development of the airplane got it and after

1940
02:22:01.94 --> 02:22:04.82
After it was deployed even the first few years

1941
02:22:05.94 --> 02:22:07.94
And I remember when I went to the um

1942
02:22:09.38 --> 02:22:11.38
18th wing

1943
02:22:11.38 --> 02:22:16.90
They were putting in safety pack 19 and 20 and 21

1944
02:22:18.02 --> 02:22:19.22
God

1945
02:22:19.22 --> 02:22:21.38
It had a terrible reputation, but

1946
02:22:22.82 --> 02:22:24.82
I have to say

1947
02:22:24.82 --> 02:22:26.82
About the 105

1948
02:22:28.02 --> 02:22:30.74
Once we got all the bugs worked out on it

1949
02:22:31.78 --> 02:22:34.74
It was a very reliable airplane

1950
02:22:36.02 --> 02:22:38.02
And it made a good bomber

1951
02:22:39.54 --> 02:22:43.94
You didn't want a dog fight with it except with another 105

1952
02:22:43.94 --> 02:22:52.90
Uh, they called it that fb, you know a fighter bomber

1953
02:22:54.82 --> 02:22:56.82
I flew a tour

1954
02:22:57.46 --> 02:23:00.82
Or a part of a tour in southeast asia with it

1955
02:23:01.62 --> 02:23:03.94
After we'd not quit going north

1956
02:23:03.94 --> 02:23:13.86
We were just bombing the Ho Chi Minh trail. Uh

1957
02:23:14.50 --> 02:23:17.54
You talk about that uh deployment to vietnam

1958
02:23:18.42 --> 02:23:20.42
And what that was like

1959
02:23:20.74 --> 02:23:27.62
Uh, it's I mean we had pretty good air superiority compared compared to when you were fighting the luft wafua over france

1960
02:23:27.62 --> 02:23:29.62
Hey, hell, that's for sure

1961
02:23:31.30 --> 02:23:33.14
Um

1962
02:23:33.14 --> 02:23:35.70
And and eventually your jets get sent home

1963
02:23:36.66 --> 02:23:38.26
Because you had a bad relationship

1964
02:23:38.26 --> 02:23:43.30
If something happened with the tai government because you were in tai land and something what what something went wrong there

1965
02:23:44.26 --> 02:23:46.26
Oh, no, it wasn't um

1966
02:23:47.38 --> 02:23:49.38
It was near the end of the war

1967
02:23:50.42 --> 02:23:58.34
And so they decided to to send the strike thuds, you know the ones making the bombing strikes

1968
02:23:58.34 --> 02:24:01.94
Send one of the groups home

1969
02:24:03.78 --> 02:24:07.46
And unfortunately it it was my group

1970
02:24:09.62 --> 02:24:11.62
I got in a pentagon

1971
02:24:12.74 --> 02:24:14.90
When I left okinawa, I thought

1972
02:24:16.02 --> 02:24:18.02
I'm combat ready in the airplane

1973
02:24:19.06 --> 02:24:23.78
Next logical place is to go to southeast asia, but I'm a bird colonel

1974
02:24:23.78 --> 02:24:28.50
And those assignments are more difficult good good assignments

1975
02:24:29.78 --> 02:24:31.78
Uh

1976
02:24:31.78 --> 02:24:33.78
I said no you're going to the pentagon

1977
02:24:35.78 --> 02:24:37.78
I didn't want to do that

1978
02:24:38.58 --> 02:24:40.58
And I guess my grumblings

1979
02:24:41.14 --> 02:24:44.18
Got down to the colonels assignments somewhere and so

1980
02:24:45.14 --> 02:24:48.50
I got a call he says hey we got a need for a

1981
02:24:48.50 --> 02:24:53.14
Colonel who's been a wing commander who's checked out in the equipment

1982
02:24:54.34 --> 02:24:56.82
Uh and your name flashed out

1983
02:24:58.10 --> 02:25:01.78
I said yeah, that's what I wanted to do when I left okinawa, you know

1984
02:25:03.06 --> 02:25:06.50
And I said well if you want to take it you can take it

1985
02:25:07.86 --> 02:25:09.86
I'll take it

1986
02:25:09.94 --> 02:25:11.94
and uh

1987
02:25:13.06 --> 02:25:15.06
Um

1988
02:25:15.06 --> 02:25:18.10
Then he said well I got to tell you something bad about it

1989
02:25:19.70 --> 02:25:21.94
It may close while you're there

1990
02:25:22.58 --> 02:25:24.58
Maybe shut down good

1991
02:25:25.30 --> 02:25:28.34
Send the wild weasel airplanes home

1992
02:25:29.46 --> 02:25:31.46
No keep them

1993
02:25:31.62 --> 02:25:34.90
And send the strike eagles strike

1994
02:25:35.78 --> 02:25:39.06
Not eagles the fuds strike that's home

1995
02:25:39.06 --> 02:25:49.30
So nobody knew what to do the uh state department said oh you cannot close that wing at this moment

1996
02:25:51.06 --> 02:25:56.50
And uh we went in there with a just a handshake

1997
02:25:57.86 --> 02:26:01.62
We didn't normally when you go into a foreign country

1998
02:26:02.66 --> 02:26:05.38
You have a status of forces agreement

1999
02:26:05.38 --> 02:26:13.94
where they give you example cases like uh one of your truck drivers kills a

2000
02:26:15.14 --> 02:26:17.86
A tie in an accident what do you do?

2001
02:26:20.10 --> 02:26:21.86
And we didn't have any of those

2002
02:26:22.74 --> 02:26:29.22
We went in they ties wanted us in and we we wanted in so we went in

2003
02:26:30.66 --> 02:26:32.66
Anyway, uh

2004
02:26:32.66 --> 02:26:35.78
We got all these things the ties wanted uh

2005
02:26:36.90 --> 02:26:40.26
Everything they wanted everything including the airplane

2006
02:26:42.10 --> 02:26:44.10
But uh when the time came

2007
02:26:45.46 --> 02:26:47.46
We start shutting down

2008
02:26:48.50 --> 02:26:50.50
But still with no uh

2009
02:26:51.94 --> 02:26:53.94
No, uh

2010
02:26:55.14 --> 02:27:00.98
No end date, you know when did we when did we shut down right?

2011
02:27:00.98 --> 02:27:05.14
State department was the was the problem there

2012
02:27:06.90 --> 02:27:09.46
And Christ's ties were still

2013
02:27:10.42 --> 02:27:13.14
Shipping us bombs, you know driving the

2014
02:27:14.02 --> 02:27:16.02
truckloads of bombs

2015
02:27:16.82 --> 02:27:20.66
They go through the tie gate and get the cum shaw, you know

2016
02:27:22.66 --> 02:27:26.50
And they didn't want to turn off the bombs so they're they're bringing them to us

2017
02:27:28.10 --> 02:27:30.10
We're stacking them in the road

2018
02:27:30.10 --> 02:27:32.66
You know the shelters are all filled

2019
02:27:33.22 --> 02:27:36.26
So we're stacking them in the goddamn roads in the

2020
02:27:37.30 --> 02:27:39.30
Jesus just

2021
02:27:40.10 --> 02:27:43.30
You know violation or regulation after regulation

2022
02:27:44.66 --> 02:27:46.66
And uh

2023
02:27:46.82 --> 02:27:48.82
Not having any luck at that

2024
02:27:49.46 --> 02:27:51.46
got a

2025
02:27:51.94 --> 02:27:53.94
Seven to the force

2026
02:27:54.18 --> 02:27:56.18
seventh Air Force

2027
02:27:56.18 --> 02:27:59.62
The assistance team came to visit us

2028
02:28:00.58 --> 02:28:02.58
Help us shut down

2029
02:28:03.38 --> 02:28:06.74
And so I said well, we only need one thing

2030
02:28:07.38 --> 02:28:10.18
Giving a date a shutdown operation

2031
02:28:10.90 --> 02:28:12.90
Well, we can't do that right now

2032
02:28:14.02 --> 02:28:16.58
Well, you could stop the bombs from coming in

2033
02:28:18.66 --> 02:28:21.30
The four star turns to the colonel and he says

2034
02:28:22.10 --> 02:28:24.10
Take care of that

2035
02:28:24.10 --> 02:28:26.26
And we got the bombs shut down

2036
02:28:27.62 --> 02:28:29.62
And I'm still on date

2037
02:28:31.06 --> 02:28:33.06
And uh

2038
02:28:33.86 --> 02:28:37.54
I learned I learned a few things during this period of time

2039
02:28:38.26 --> 02:28:41.38
It was I'm going home to mandatory retirement

2040
02:28:44.02 --> 02:28:46.02
And uh

2041
02:28:46.02 --> 02:28:51.54
I won't tell that story. Let's see

2042
02:28:55.46 --> 02:28:58.26
They offered you a billet and Saigon and you said, nah

2043
02:28:59.46 --> 02:29:05.78
I'm not going to sit around here. I'm a oh after yeah, yeah after they shut it down. Yeah, we're still closing the base down

2044
02:29:07.06 --> 02:29:09.62
Oh, I can tell you that. Okay. I'll tell this to you

2045
02:29:09.62 --> 02:29:11.62
Yeah

2046
02:29:15.70 --> 02:29:21.06
Yeah another meeting but I think it was the same meeting that I went down there to fly with you

2047
02:29:22.82 --> 02:29:24.82
And this

2048
02:29:24.82 --> 02:29:26.82
young brigadier general there was

2049
02:29:27.70 --> 02:29:29.70
in operations

2050
02:29:30.98 --> 02:29:34.10
Was was at this dinner and

2051
02:29:34.10 --> 02:29:39.22
Uh, something came up about me going to the headquarters

2052
02:29:40.02 --> 02:29:45.06
And he pipes up. Yeah, I've got chose you. It'll be good for your career

2053
02:29:46.26 --> 02:29:49.06
So I said in the loudest voice I could

2054
02:29:50.34 --> 02:29:52.18
Gracefully do

2055
02:29:52.18 --> 02:29:55.70
Oh, then you know, I go home to mandatory retirement

2056
02:29:57.06 --> 02:29:59.06
Yeah, really good for my career

2057
02:30:01.54 --> 02:30:03.54
God damn

2058
02:30:03.54 --> 02:30:04.90
So

2059
02:30:04.90 --> 02:30:07.38
You end up going uh, go ahead

2060
02:30:08.18 --> 02:30:09.30
I

2061
02:30:09.30 --> 02:30:11.30
On closing base

2062
02:30:11.70 --> 02:30:13.46
I said, uh

2063
02:30:13.46 --> 02:30:15.46
I took I had seven full kernels

2064
02:30:16.34 --> 02:30:18.34
I said, it's you you

2065
02:30:18.74 --> 02:30:22.34
Close you make a plan to close your function

2066
02:30:24.10 --> 02:30:27.30
You know from day one if I tell you

2067
02:30:28.42 --> 02:30:29.86
How many days?

2068
02:30:29.86 --> 02:30:31.86
weeks whatever

2069
02:30:31.86 --> 02:30:33.86
Does it take you to shut down?

2070
02:30:36.02 --> 02:30:39.70
And so I said every one of you do that and then give it to me

2071
02:30:40.90 --> 02:30:43.54
I put them all together added two months

2072
02:30:44.34 --> 02:30:46.34
and picked the date

2073
02:30:47.46 --> 02:30:49.46
And uh

2074
02:30:50.10 --> 02:30:52.98
Then I decided to put it in a telegram

2075
02:30:54.82 --> 02:30:58.66
To all ships at sea and everybody I could think of

2076
02:30:58.66 --> 02:31:02.42
And state department everybody

2077
02:31:04.18 --> 02:31:06.18
And title

2078
02:31:07.14 --> 02:31:09.14
Closure clothes of

2079
02:31:10.74 --> 02:31:14.34
Closure of tockley plan something like that

2080
02:31:16.10 --> 02:31:18.82
And I sent that thing and then sat back

2081
02:31:20.98 --> 02:31:23.78
And I had no idea what I was going to get

2082
02:31:24.90 --> 02:31:27.22
And oh, oh christ we got a plan

2083
02:31:27.22 --> 02:31:29.22
And it worked like

2084
02:31:29.78 --> 02:31:37.78
It it it like we're like magic. Yeah, we call that leading up the chain of command. We're gonna make this happen

2085
02:31:37.86 --> 02:31:39.38
Jesus christ

2086
02:31:42.26 --> 02:31:44.98
Yeah, everybody was so happy except the

2087
02:31:44.98 --> 02:31:54.98
Except the state department, but I learned a lot of things about

2088
02:32:01.06 --> 02:32:03.06
Waste in government

2089
02:32:04.66 --> 02:32:08.74
So we tried to get rid of everything we had and it

2090
02:32:09.46 --> 02:32:12.66
What didn't we could went into the trash

2091
02:32:12.66 --> 02:32:14.66
And went to the ties

2092
02:32:17.38 --> 02:32:19.38
And

2093
02:32:20.74 --> 02:32:22.74
So

2094
02:32:23.86 --> 02:32:25.54
Oh

2095
02:32:25.54 --> 02:32:29.86
One morning they came and told me hey, we got a dead tie officer in the

2096
02:32:30.82 --> 02:32:32.82
such and such building

2097
02:32:32.98 --> 02:32:34.98
It was one of the buildings we were

2098
02:32:36.02 --> 02:32:40.50
Cleaning up, but we had not turned over to the ties yet

2099
02:32:40.50 --> 02:32:42.50
But

2100
02:32:42.50 --> 02:32:45.78
And he was in there tearing out the electric wire

2101
02:32:47.22 --> 02:32:49.22
Electrocuted himself

2102
02:32:49.22 --> 02:32:51.22
They were you know selling it

2103
02:32:55.22 --> 02:32:58.74
But about about to trash so

2104
02:33:01.06 --> 02:33:03.06
Steel lockers

2105
02:33:03.06 --> 02:33:10.90
Labor intensive to tear up tear down very heavy

2106
02:33:12.82 --> 02:33:14.82
If I tore down

2107
02:33:15.54 --> 02:33:17.46
Torm down

2108
02:33:17.46 --> 02:33:21.62
Shipped him home. Nobody would have said a word, but it would have cost like hell

2109
02:33:22.82 --> 02:33:24.82
But if I put him in the dump

2110
02:33:25.30 --> 02:33:28.18
Aha government waste look at this

2111
02:33:28.18 --> 02:33:31.30
But what we did was

2112
02:33:33.94 --> 02:33:35.94
The

2113
02:33:35.94 --> 02:33:37.94
South Vietnam

2114
02:33:38.10 --> 02:33:40.66
How that created they needed them badly

2115
02:33:41.86 --> 02:33:48.10
So I said well you send somebody over here and dismantle them and get your c-130s

2116
02:33:49.22 --> 02:33:51.22
I got tons of them

2117
02:33:51.22 --> 02:33:57.38
And so we got rid of most of them that way and some of them did make it to the dump, but

2118
02:33:58.58 --> 02:34:00.58
It was a hell of a lot cheaper than

2119
02:34:00.74 --> 02:34:03.14
packing them up and sending them home

2120
02:34:03.86 --> 02:34:09.14
And nobody would complain. There you go. You got to find those solutions. Yeah

2121
02:34:10.10 --> 02:34:11.30
uh

2122
02:34:11.30 --> 02:34:13.30
So you end up

2123
02:34:13.38 --> 02:34:15.06
getting orders

2124
02:34:15.06 --> 02:34:20.02
Back to mcclellan air force base, which is which is about 90 minutes from auburn

2125
02:34:20.02 --> 02:34:22.02
Uh-huh, which is where you're from

2126
02:34:22.82 --> 02:34:27.06
Uh, this was sort of what we call. I don't know if you call in the navy. We call it a twilight tour

2127
02:34:27.78 --> 02:34:33.62
This was sort of your twilight tour. You get put in charge of maintenance. You still get to fly t33. So you're happy about that

2128
02:34:34.58 --> 02:34:37.78
But this is sort of this is where you uh end up your career

2129
02:34:38.34 --> 02:34:39.30
right

2130
02:34:39.30 --> 02:34:41.38
And I'll go to the book here

2131
02:34:42.74 --> 02:34:44.74
You say too soon

2132
02:34:45.06 --> 02:34:46.82
It was over

2133
02:34:46.82 --> 02:34:51.86
There was talk about a big ceremony, but I asked them to forget about that and just mail me my papers

2134
02:34:52.66 --> 02:34:55.38
There was a short sweet ceremony in the commander's office

2135
02:34:55.78 --> 02:34:59.22
Ellie her folks and my mother were there and that was it

2136
02:35:00.10 --> 02:35:06.10
30 years and 30 days from my day of enlistment at age 50. I was a civilian again

2137
02:35:06.74 --> 02:35:09.46
Going out in the place where it had all begun

2138
02:35:10.34 --> 02:35:12.34
My mother had actually written

2139
02:35:12.34 --> 02:35:17.86
The epitaph for my career a bit earlier when I'd flown home from tokli

2140
02:35:19.06 --> 02:35:23.06
Well, she said when I walked through the door, are you satisfied now?

2141
02:35:24.82 --> 02:35:26.82
I said sure

2142
02:35:26.82 --> 02:35:28.82
file it under white lies

2143
02:35:32.18 --> 02:35:35.54
Because that's you know, you can never be happy never be satisfied

2144
02:35:36.74 --> 02:35:37.94
um

2145
02:35:37.94 --> 02:35:39.94
And that was the end of your career

2146
02:35:39.94 --> 02:35:43.38
In the in the Air Force you ended up working for mcdonald douglas

2147
02:35:44.42 --> 02:35:46.58
Well, they mcdonald aircraft company

2148
02:35:46.98 --> 02:35:51.30
Had them later mcdonald douglas got it. They bought them out

2149
02:35:52.10 --> 02:35:53.78
uh

2150
02:35:53.78 --> 02:35:58.58
It took a few years off from flying, but then you started missing it you started flying again

2151
02:35:59.78 --> 02:36:03.46
Uh, you got some great stories in here is when you got

2152
02:36:04.34 --> 02:36:07.30
A version of old crow back in one of these

2153
02:36:07.30 --> 02:36:09.30
Uh restored

2154
02:36:09.30 --> 02:36:12.90
p-51s you got to fly that you got to fly with jager

2155
02:36:13.54 --> 02:36:15.54
Again in some of these air shows

2156
02:36:16.18 --> 02:36:17.06
um

2157
02:36:17.06 --> 02:36:24.02
Just again the stories as as the book closes out and and how it goes and the rest of the stuff you've done just

2158
02:36:25.22 --> 02:36:28.26
Great just an incredible story incredible story

2159
02:36:30.42 --> 02:36:32.34
How'd you feel that day when you retired?

2160
02:36:32.34 --> 02:36:34.34
I had mixed emotions

2161
02:36:37.06 --> 02:36:41.86
I know so in the seal teams, you know, you have we call it a drying cage, but it's basically a big locker

2162
02:36:42.10 --> 02:36:44.10
Probably the size of a prison cell

2163
02:36:44.66 --> 02:36:50.90
But you have all your gear in there all your gear in there that you collect for the years that you're in and I was in for 20 years

2164
02:36:51.70 --> 02:36:55.70
But I remember my last day. I got my van downstairs

2165
02:36:56.66 --> 02:36:59.86
And I and for me it's kind of similar in that

2166
02:36:59.86 --> 02:37:04.74
18 out of 20 years. I was stationed in Coronado in San Diego

2167
02:37:05.46 --> 02:37:07.46
All within a hundred yards

2168
02:37:07.62 --> 02:37:09.14
Seal team one

2169
02:37:09.14 --> 02:37:15.78
Seal team three seal team seven when seal team seven was was in an old building right next to seal team one

2170
02:37:16.02 --> 02:37:21.54
And then the training command they're all 100 or 200 yards apart. That's where I spent my whole adult life

2171
02:37:22.58 --> 02:37:24.02
And then one day

2172
02:37:24.02 --> 02:37:27.06
My last day I retired I went up cleaned out my locker

2173
02:37:27.06 --> 02:37:31.62
My last day I retired I went up cleaned out my locker my my gear cage

2174
02:37:32.42 --> 02:37:34.82
Through all that stuff in my van and left

2175
02:37:36.18 --> 02:37:39.70
And that was a pretty empty feeling when I left because you it's your whole life

2176
02:37:40.90 --> 02:37:44.66
Uh, so I'm sure you had some of that when you when you got done. Oh, yeah

2177
02:37:45.78 --> 02:37:47.78
um actually

2178
02:37:48.02 --> 02:37:50.02
Comment was made that by my mother

2179
02:37:51.14 --> 02:37:53.94
was made when I was retired

2180
02:37:53.94 --> 02:38:00.74
And after I was retired she said well you satisfied me up now

2181
02:38:04.02 --> 02:38:07.30
Well, tell you what this is probably a pretty good place to stop. Um

2182
02:38:08.50 --> 02:38:11.38
The book has so much more detailed information in it

2183
02:38:12.10 --> 02:38:14.58
You know, it's just an incredible life

2184
02:38:15.86 --> 02:38:19.30
Incredible hero and I got to read one more quote from the book. You said

2185
02:38:20.18 --> 02:38:22.18
You said all those years

2186
02:38:22.18 --> 02:38:24.18
They'd actually paid me to fly

2187
02:38:25.46 --> 02:38:27.46
What a deal

2188
02:38:27.86 --> 02:38:29.86
It's just uh

2189
02:38:29.94 --> 02:38:31.94
Incredible Dave you got anything else?

2190
02:38:32.90 --> 02:38:35.78
I'm sure you guys could talk for hours. I'm sure you are

2191
02:38:36.50 --> 02:38:38.50
It's this has been

2192
02:38:38.74 --> 02:38:44.34
This has probably been one of the best three hours of honestly of my entire life getting to be here and

2193
02:38:44.34 --> 02:38:53.06
You know, I'm I'm lucky. Um, I get to work with jaco. I'm on this podcast a bunch and I've gotten to meet so many veterans

2194
02:38:53.06 --> 02:38:56.34
And then and then now, you know, this movie top gun just came out again

2195
02:38:56.42 --> 02:38:59.54
And it's so prominent and and people ask me all the time

2196
02:39:00.66 --> 02:39:04.98
You know, what was the first movie like and I saw that I was 13 when the first movie came out

2197
02:39:04.98 --> 02:39:10.42
So as you know at that age when you see something at that young age you look at it and you think man, I really

2198
02:39:10.42 --> 02:39:17.22
Want to do that and a lot of times when people ask me, you know, why'd you become a pilot? I think about that movie a lot but

2199
02:39:18.34 --> 02:39:22.42
As a little kid, you know much before 13 14 I was reading books

2200
02:39:23.70 --> 02:39:25.70
And I remember as a little kid

2201
02:39:25.70 --> 02:39:32.82
Reading a book on on pappy boington and and reading a book on on the black sheep squadron. There's a tv show, you know

2202
02:39:33.94 --> 02:39:35.94
Long before top gun. I was I was already

2203
02:39:37.22 --> 02:39:39.22
I was already enamored

2204
02:39:39.22 --> 02:39:41.22
already enamored and it was it was

2205
02:39:42.82 --> 02:39:44.42
Jaeger

2206
02:39:44.42 --> 02:39:45.62
Anderson

2207
02:39:45.62 --> 02:39:50.82
Foss and boington and what I've realized in this podcast as I'm listening to you talk

2208
02:39:51.86 --> 02:39:53.86
When I was a little kid

2209
02:39:53.86 --> 02:39:55.86
What I wanted to be was you

2210
02:39:56.34 --> 02:39:58.34
I wanted to be you

2211
02:39:58.34 --> 02:40:04.82
And I can't express how much gratitude I feel and how much reflection I have now is a very little boy

2212
02:40:04.82 --> 02:40:09.46
Long before the movie top gun ever came out is what I wanted to be was what you described in this book

2213
02:40:09.86 --> 02:40:12.50
And to get to sit across from you and hear you talk about this

2214
02:40:13.54 --> 02:40:19.54
Is just an honor of of my lifetime and I can look back now and when people ask me why I wanted to be a fighter pilot

2215
02:40:20.58 --> 02:40:25.30
I can tell them that I got to meet the reason why so thank you very much. This has been awesome

2216
02:40:25.78 --> 02:40:26.98
Thank you

2217
02:40:26.98 --> 02:40:31.38
Yeah, I don't have much to say after that, Dave. Um, I got you know

2218
02:40:31.38 --> 02:40:33.38
I

2219
02:40:34.58 --> 02:40:36.58
Get asked

2220
02:40:37.70 --> 02:40:41.78
You know, what do you what do you tell kids today?

2221
02:40:43.86 --> 02:40:46.50
And what I tell kids today is

2222
02:40:48.18 --> 02:40:54.82
You know, you really can be what you want to be and there's a good example of it right there

2223
02:40:56.10 --> 02:40:58.10
If you want to be something

2224
02:40:58.74 --> 02:41:00.74
Really really bad

2225
02:41:00.74 --> 02:41:02.74
You can be it

2226
02:41:03.38 --> 02:41:05.22
and

2227
02:41:05.22 --> 02:41:08.26
I say to kids live your dreams

2228
02:41:10.50 --> 02:41:12.50
And uh

2229
02:41:13.54 --> 02:41:15.06

And to defend freedom in the world

2249
02:42:37.06 --> 02:42:39.06
You fought

You fought

2251
02:42:41.06 --> 02:42:43.06
machine against machine

2252
02:42:43.62 --> 02:42:45.62
And you fought man against man

In the ultimate test of skill

2254
02:42:48.42 --> 02:42:50.42

02:43:07.22 --> 02:43:09.86
Dave I feel like I was just turning over to you at this time

2259
02:43:09.86 --> 02:43:11.38
I don't know if that's a good idea man

2260
02:43:11.38 --> 02:43:19.38
I I need a little time to decompress and kind of contemplate that that was um, I knew that was going to be a unique experience for me, but that was

2261
02:43:20.50 --> 02:43:24.74
I don't have a lot of frame of reference to what to compare that to that was and that was unreal for me man

2262
02:43:25.38 --> 02:43:29.94
When he just stepped up you were kind of rattling off some of the thoughts that you had in your head

2263
02:43:31.14 --> 02:43:33.14
As you were thinking about this

2264
02:43:33.70 --> 02:43:35.70
And you're thinking

2265
02:43:35.70 --> 02:43:37.14
for instance

2266
02:43:37.14 --> 02:43:39.14
A thousand aircraft go out

2267
02:43:39.14 --> 02:43:41.14
and

2268
02:43:41.14 --> 02:43:43.14
whatever six hours later

2269
02:43:45.22 --> 02:43:50.42
Ten percent of those are gone a hundred aircraft crews gone

2270
02:43:53.14 --> 02:43:55.86
This is what they did day after day after day after day, yeah

2271
02:43:58.34 --> 02:44:05.30
There's like I don't know is there anything equivalent for a fighter pilot to being a world war two fighter pilot

2272
02:44:05.78 --> 02:44:08.66
Look the guys in vietnam, obviously they extremely challenging

2273
02:44:08.66 --> 02:44:10.66
Uh, you know, uh

2274
02:44:10.74 --> 02:44:13.94
horrible situations to go and go and into you know having

2275
02:44:14.82 --> 02:44:19.22
Guys like charlie plum and william reeter on on the podcast to talk about their experiences

2276
02:44:20.10 --> 02:44:22.02
you know

2277
02:44:22.02 --> 02:44:24.26
Surface to air missiles migs out there

2278
02:44:25.38 --> 02:44:27.38
Uh, those encounters were

2279
02:44:28.02 --> 02:44:30.02
relatively rare

2280
02:44:30.50 --> 02:44:35.78
Compared to you're going to bomb germany. You are 100 percent

2281
02:44:35.78 --> 02:44:43.06
100 percent gonna get into it. Yeah, this is the next level. Yeah, I don't think from scale like there's nothing

2282
02:44:44.02 --> 02:44:45.78
He's talking about

2283
02:44:45.78 --> 02:44:51.62
Was it big week? Is that what they called it big week? Yeah first mission thousand bombers 800 fighters and 16

2284
02:44:52.10 --> 02:44:56.26
160 germans come up to fight them something like that. So there's 2 000 airplanes in the sky

2285
02:44:57.14 --> 02:44:58.02
and

2286
02:44:58.02 --> 02:45:00.02
250 bombers don't come home

2287
02:45:00.02 --> 02:45:06.42
I don't think there's anything certainly in my aviation mind that's even close to the scale of that

2288
02:45:06.50 --> 02:45:12.02
It's just it's hard even for me. It's really hard to relate to what that might look like. It's kind of overwhelming

2289
02:45:12.58 --> 02:45:14.10
the heavies

2290
02:45:14.10 --> 02:45:15.14
dude

2291
02:45:15.14 --> 02:45:19.94
Hey, by the way, they just mentioned this if you want to get the book to fly and fight

2292
02:45:20.42 --> 02:45:23.94
go to go to this website. I already mentioned to fly and fight.com

2293
02:45:24.82 --> 02:45:26.82
and

2294
02:45:26.82 --> 02:45:30.02
bud is signing books so you can get a signed book

2295
02:45:30.90 --> 02:45:32.90
from that website and

2296
02:45:33.46 --> 02:45:36.18
I would recommend you do it. I mean this guy's a hundred years old right now

2297
02:45:36.26 --> 02:45:39.70
Just he the stuff that he's seen in his life lucky to be here

2298
02:45:40.34 --> 02:45:42.34
um, just awesome

2299
02:45:42.34 --> 02:45:48.42
So if you get the chance and the book by the way, I I read through two dog fights

2300
02:45:49.14 --> 02:45:54.02
So there's whatever 14 more and they all have their own little details

2301
02:45:54.02 --> 02:45:57.46
They all have their own little scenarios that are happening and and look the rest of the book

2302
02:45:57.54 --> 02:45:59.62
There's all kinds of things in there that we didn't talk about

2303
02:46:00.34 --> 02:46:02.34
So if you want to hear that story

2304
02:46:02.74 --> 02:46:06.26
Go get that book to fly and fight.com

2305
02:46:06.82 --> 02:46:09.70
We may have to like once this comes out actually when you listen to this again

2306
02:46:10.34 --> 02:46:12.58
Take notes and maybe we'll do sort of a

2307
02:46:13.22 --> 02:46:18.50
A wrap up of this and you can kind of talk through some of the stuff and maybe even bring in some stuff

2308
02:46:18.58 --> 02:46:21.46
Different stuff from the book if we didn't cover it because I mean you're talking about

2309
02:46:21.46 --> 02:46:23.46
Them shooting down German

2310
02:46:24.82 --> 02:46:30.66
German pilots that were parachuting and that was just there's a bunch of other things to talk about that we didn't cover here

2311
02:46:31.06 --> 02:46:35.86
So when you listen to this take notes and maybe we'll do another sort of a recap

2312
02:46:36.34 --> 02:46:39.14
Or an after-actions on this even if it's just like, you know

2313
02:46:39.86 --> 02:46:41.86
An hour or four or whatever

2314
02:46:42.02 --> 02:46:44.02
Right on we can go through it

2315
02:46:44.10 --> 02:46:48.58
Echo Charles you've been here the whole time, but you've been quiet. Yes because you've been uh, you didn't have a mic

2316
02:46:48.58 --> 02:46:56.50
Yes, so on purpose. What you know, let's face it. What am I gonna add to well then again? I did kind of have some there

2317
02:46:57.70 --> 02:46:59.70
That first dog fight

2318
02:46:59.78 --> 02:47:05.22
You know what wait the first one or the one the first one that you read one that he said luck you shot

2319
02:47:05.86 --> 02:47:07.86
Yeah, yeah, so I I was

2320
02:47:08.82 --> 02:47:11.94
So a lot of people say like oh you should read my audiobook or whatever

2321
02:47:12.02 --> 02:47:15.46
But that was the first time where I was like you should read this audiobook

2322
02:47:15.46 --> 02:47:21.30
You meaning him or you meaning me you okay? So because and of course the story's laid out like perfect

2323
02:47:21.54 --> 02:47:24.26
Right, especially at the end. I don't know why I like the end so much when he was like

2324
02:47:24.26 --> 02:47:25.70
Oh, I don't even know if that was my shot

2325
02:47:25.70 --> 02:47:28.50
It might have been the other guy shot, you know, and I don't even know how to approach this guy

2326
02:47:28.50 --> 02:47:30.66
And then when he found out it was his that was good

2327
02:47:33.06 --> 02:47:36.74
Yeah, you know, I didn't I actually didn't read that part so he could kind of tell the story

2328
02:47:36.74 --> 02:47:40.90
And it's a weird thing to try and figure like what do you want to read and what do you want to hear from them?

2329
02:47:40.90 --> 02:47:45.94
You know and you got about I mean in my mind. I'm always trying to think like I want to give them enough that they go

2330
02:47:45.94 --> 02:47:50.58
Oh, yeah, and they get in the zone and then they kind of fill in the deets as they say

2331
02:47:51.78 --> 02:47:56.02
But man, you know, it's such an honor to be able to have these guys on and

2332
02:47:56.74 --> 02:47:58.74
Hear their stories man. It's just

2333
02:47:59.54 --> 02:48:02.18
It's crazy and then you know, you always have to think to yourself

2334
02:48:02.90 --> 02:48:05.78
that there's almost 300,000

2335
02:48:05.78 --> 02:48:10.98
That didn't come home from this war and that didn't get to tell their story and didn't get to have kids

2336
02:48:11.62 --> 02:48:13.62
um, yeah, it's just

2337
02:48:14.26 --> 02:48:18.26
So we're so lucky to be able to to have this opportunity to do this so

2338
02:48:20.18 --> 02:48:23.86
Appreciate y'all listening and and if you want to support what we're doing here

2339
02:48:24.18 --> 02:48:27.06
And you want to support yourself too, which is a bonus. It's true

2340
02:48:27.54 --> 02:48:31.06
Some people might even prioritize supporting yourself over supporting what we're doing here

2341
02:48:31.46 --> 02:48:34.10
Either way, it's a win because if you support yourself good

2342
02:48:34.10 --> 02:48:37.46
We I want you to be stronger and smarter and faster and better

2343
02:48:37.78 --> 02:48:43.38
Yeah, it's for one of the functions of this the existence of this whole outfit. I think yeah

2344
02:48:43.62 --> 02:48:47.62
So if you want that you can go if you want to support you want to support yourself

2345
02:48:47.70 --> 02:48:52.82
You want to support america by the way you can see I kind of got a little fired up when we started talking about the p51 Mustang

2346
02:48:54.26 --> 02:48:59.78
The p51 Mustang was like the it was a game changer a game changer

2347
02:48:59.78 --> 02:49:06.58
500 miles an hour. It's just faster and stronger and better and it was american made

2348
02:49:07.22 --> 02:49:09.22
it was american made and and

2349
02:49:09.78 --> 02:49:11.78
Obviously it was american made

2350
02:49:11.94 --> 02:49:18.42
But just think of like every detail that the engineering the design the material like all that went into that and that that

2351
02:49:18.74 --> 02:49:23.78
That wasn't even an idea on december 7th 1941. That wasn't even an idea. They're just like, okay, cool

2352
02:49:23.78 --> 02:49:27.38
We have to build the bet you think well, I actually don't know the history wasn't an idea yet

2353
02:49:27.38 --> 02:49:28.82
I

2354
02:49:28.82 --> 02:49:33.46
Don't know exactly the development of it. They knew we knew we needed better airplanes

2355
02:49:33.62 --> 02:49:38.74
But I don't think anybody certainly in 1941 it could have predicted what the Mustang was going to be

2356
02:49:39.38 --> 02:49:41.22
Other than we needed something

2357
02:49:41.22 --> 02:49:45.62
Well, I was so fired up listening to talk about the Mustang that I started thinking about the Ford Mustang

2358
02:49:45.70 --> 02:49:49.06
Like I just need to get a Ford Mustang because I can't get a Mustang Mustang

2359
02:49:49.14 --> 02:49:52.02
I can't get a p51 Mustang, but I get a Ford Mustang

2360
02:49:52.34 --> 02:49:55.30
That's an american made piece of machinine legit legit

2361
02:49:55.30 --> 02:50:00.18
That's how fired up. I was getting talking about this aircraft

2362
02:50:00.98 --> 02:50:04.18
and uh, what they did with it so

2363
02:50:04.98 --> 02:50:09.94
America she wants some american made stuff well for hey jockel fuel got jockel fuel.com go get some stuff

2364
02:50:10.10 --> 02:50:13.78
Hey jockel fuel. We got all new flavors. I was pounded mine today. Were you pounding yours today, Dave?

2365
02:50:13.86 --> 02:50:16.18
How's that new orange? It's so good. Do you think your orange could be better?

2366
02:50:16.66 --> 02:50:21.70
I didn't know that it could be better. No, but I know that it's like the p51 Mustang of freaking drinks

2367
02:50:21.70 --> 02:50:26.98
It's the upgrade. It's like the new version of the Mustang. It's a little bit better. It's a little bit better

2368
02:50:27.78 --> 02:50:29.78
And echo Charles, how are you over there on the mango?

2369
02:50:30.90 --> 02:50:36.50
Actually, I got messages saying that that's their new favorite flavor. Oh, so you got people that the mango comes through more

2370
02:50:37.38 --> 02:50:42.02
So their old favorite flavor was mango and their new favorite flavors mango. Is that what you're saying?

2371
02:50:42.10 --> 02:50:45.22
Their old favorite flavor apparently was not mango

2372
02:50:45.94 --> 02:50:49.78
Just guessing what the last one was nonetheless. Yeah, they're all they're all a lot better

2373
02:50:49.78 --> 02:50:55.70
They're all a lot better. They're different. They're they're in a different category. So jockel fuel.com get yourself some milk

2374
02:50:55.70 --> 02:50:58.50
Get yourself some joint warfare some krill super krill

2375
02:50:59.30 --> 02:51:05.22
uh origin usa's look made in america is a thing and peep like you know like bud anderson said people like

2376
02:51:05.30 --> 02:51:08.58
Oh, we can't make the stuff over here. I laugh at them

2377
02:51:09.62 --> 02:51:13.86
That's what p roberts did when they said hey, you can't make gays in america. He laughed at them

2378
02:51:13.86 --> 02:51:19.54
Because guess what we can we have the capability we have the technology we have the skill set we have the will

2379
02:51:19.94 --> 02:51:21.46
To get it done

2380
02:51:21.46 --> 02:51:24.90
And look you can go buy your you can go buy your your genes. Let's say

2381
02:51:25.62 --> 02:51:28.98
From a place that is literally has slaves

2382
02:51:30.10 --> 02:51:32.74
You can that's what you can do or you can buy it from america

2383
02:51:33.54 --> 02:51:35.94
Where we're on board with freedom

2384
02:51:37.38 --> 02:51:39.78
With freedom that's what's happening

2385
02:51:39.78 --> 02:51:42.98
And they happen to be the best genes that I own

2386
02:51:44.10 --> 02:51:46.10
51 of

2387
02:51:46.26 --> 02:51:51.30
You know what I think the next the next modification the next modification or the next version of the genes

2388
02:51:51.30 --> 02:51:53.62
I don't even know what they might we might do but

2389
02:51:54.26 --> 02:51:57.30
There's going to be some p 51 things coming out. Yeah

2390
02:51:58.34 --> 02:52:00.90
And look I get it p 38 love it

2391
02:52:01.22 --> 02:52:05.78
Uh corsair love it. You probably love the corsair a lot. I do because you because that's marine core

2392
02:52:05.78 --> 02:52:10.98
Or wait, what's your is that your favorite bird world war two when I grow up happy boynton black sheep

2393
02:52:11.70 --> 02:52:16.90
Marine core corsairs win in the war in the pacific. Yes. Listen the p 51

2394
02:52:17.54 --> 02:52:22.42
Is the iconic world war two fighter and everybody knows it that doesn't mean I don't love the corsair

2395
02:52:22.58 --> 02:52:26.98
All the marines out there know what's up, but listen the p 51. That's the machine that won the war in europe

2396
02:52:26.98 --> 02:52:27.94
Everybody knows it bro

2397
02:52:27.94 --> 02:52:32.98
Sometimes the the p 51 flies like in the vicinity of my house because they'll do the coastal runs

2398
02:52:32.98 --> 02:52:36.58
And I can hear them and then you look up the the silhouette

2399
02:52:36.82 --> 02:52:38.34
Look the cool thing that's cool

2400
02:52:38.34 --> 02:52:44.42
Like it would be a little bit difficult to tell a corsair from the side profile, you know when it's out at a little distance, you know

2401
02:52:45.30 --> 02:52:48.66
But a p 51 you see that bottom air scoop you're like there it is

2402
02:52:49.62 --> 02:52:51.62
Big daddy's coming home

2403

Have you seen the pictures of the camo in the in the in the environment as they say?

2408
02:53:16.18 --> 02:53:17.86
So of course they did

2409
02:53:17.86 --> 02:53:22.66
Made a big deal out of it made a thing out of it. It was good. Oh, yeah, you made a predator quote

2410
02:53:22.66 --> 02:53:29.30
And they like that messed it up though after I really revisited it, but it was good. It passed it landed you got there

2411
02:53:29.54 --> 02:53:33.22
All right, so good. It looked good for the first. Yeah, it does. It's awesome

2412
02:53:33.86 --> 02:53:37.94
Uh, jockel fuel.com originusa.com jockelstore.com. Yeah, that's what echo made

2413
02:53:38.42 --> 02:53:43.30

They've kicked people off of platforms for what they've said

2443
02:55:53.54 --> 02:55:57.62

And I just think I just my life

2464
02:57:41.62 --> 02:57:44.18
Every podcast should just be about another section of about face

2465
02:57:45.06 --> 02:57:48.74
There's so many things in there. It's so filled with goodness

2466
02:57:49.94 --> 02:57:51.94
That you miss goodness

2467
02:57:52.10 --> 02:57:56.26
Right, it's like you walk into a buffet and maybe over in a corner. There's like some some uh

2468
02:57:56.26 --> 02:57:59.14
Uh, some little wagyu beef like

2469
02:58:00.02 --> 02:58:01.30
Nibblets, right?

2472
02:58:08.26 --> 02:58:13.38
Well, I know more room on your plate kind either that or just overwhelmed with goodness. Yeah, there's goodness everywhere

2473
02:58:13.54 --> 02:58:18.90
Maybe they got some mulk like in the containers. You ready to drink, you know, we got ready to drink mulk coming

2474
02:58:19.30 --> 02:58:21.30
R.T.D. as they said

2475
02:58:21.86 --> 02:58:25.86
I was worried not worried you you you you you you

2476
02:58:25.86 --> 02:58:31.46
You want to control your expectations, right? You want to be like look, it's going to be healthy. There's no sugar

2477
02:58:31.78 --> 02:58:35.54
Like you know, how can it it's going to be it'll be good, but how good

2478
02:58:36.58 --> 02:58:38.26
Dude, it's

2479
02:58:38.26 --> 02:58:41.70
Gtg as we say. Yes. It's good to go. E.A.E.

2480
02:58:42.26 --> 02:58:44.26
Yeah, all this

2481
02:58:44.82 --> 02:58:51.22
It's it's delicious. Yeah, I was comparing it. I will I wanted it to taste as good as a certain

2482
02:58:51.22 --> 02:58:58.10
Um, let's say known well-known brand of chocolate flavored drink. We'll say we're there

2483
02:58:59.06 --> 02:59:03.38
We're there. All right, that's good. That's good. Yeah, that's interesting. It's outstanding

2484
02:59:03.46 --> 02:59:07.38
You imagine drinking something that is completely good for you and it tastes delicious

2485
02:59:07.46 --> 02:59:12.34
I don't even have to imagine anymore. Oh, yeah, and and I said this from the beginning

2486
02:59:12.50 --> 02:59:17.78
Where my kids like the the you know, there's word kid mokkawara. They like the regular one like the best

2487
02:59:17.78 --> 02:59:23.78
They think that's like a treat and I kind of psychologically like train them to know that that's like the treat or whatever

2488
02:59:24.34 --> 02:59:27.06
But yeah, and so I know I do a guilt-free, you know

2489
02:59:28.10 --> 02:59:32.26
There's something that you can do that tastes so has so much goodness so much

2490
02:59:32.82 --> 02:59:35.70
So much immediate gratification and no downside

2491
02:59:37.22 --> 02:59:40.18
Short and long-term pain. Yeah, that's kind of a

2492
02:59:40.18 --> 02:59:47.14
I guess you could look at jocco fuel from a strategic perspective and one of the consistent

2493
02:59:48.90 --> 02:59:50.90
underlying themes of the

2494
02:59:51.70 --> 02:59:53.70
products is

2495
02:59:53.70 --> 03:00:01.14
Short-term mega gratification taste wise and long-term total goodness across the board health wise. Yeah

2496
03:00:01.62 --> 03:00:07.06
That's a thing. It's an anomaly people people don't know what's up with that. It's kind of hard to believe in a lot of ways

2497
03:00:07.06 --> 03:00:12.26
Yeah, wait a second as Dave said earlier today. What I should say is you're welcome

2498
03:00:14.50 --> 03:00:18.42
Dave's like jocco. You just need to tell people. Oh, here's my drink. You're welcome

2499
03:00:19.70 --> 03:00:24.02
Oh, here's mokk. You're welcome. He was not wrong with that. Here's joint warfare taken

2500
03:00:24.10 --> 03:00:30.26
You're gonna be able to do things you couldn't do two weeks ago. You're welcome. Oh, but then again, I don't know joint warfare is pills

2501
03:00:30.90 --> 03:00:32.90
I know but you're welcome. Yeah

2502
03:00:33.06 --> 03:00:35.94
For sure that but yeah, okay. Yeah, the short term that's it

2503
03:00:35.94 --> 03:00:38.42
That's like what do you call it? What do you call when it's like normal?

2504
03:00:38.82 --> 03:00:43.38
You know something that you don't love but it's like the standard so whatever shut it down echo. Good work

Appreciate it. Okay. Let's just end this freaking echo screwed up. What are you talking about?

2508
03:00:58.58 --> 03:01:01.86
It's all true. We're just riding this huge wave and you're like, yeah, but those are pills

2509
03:01:01.86 --> 03:01:05.62
Okay, you know what we need to do we're gonna make some chewable

2510
03:01:06.10 --> 03:01:12.10
Oh, see right now you're talking that have a really good like lemon lime sort of zing to it tasting good

2511
03:01:12.18 --> 03:01:14.18
Okay, remember back in the day old school

2512
03:01:16.74 --> 03:01:24.98
Remember those vitamin c wafer 100 things. Okay. See now we're talking this is those vitamin c wafers is is how you end up with

2513
03:01:25.94 --> 03:01:27.14
3,500

2514
03:01:27.14 --> 03:01:29.14

2517
03:01:40.02 --> 03:01:45.22
The avenue to pursue as far as pills go. I don't mean pills. You know what but let's face it

2518
03:01:45.30 --> 03:01:48.90

03:05:13.54 --> 03:05:17.54
Thank you for fighting for our freedom with a special salute to the airmen

2567

And i don't know if this is right, dave is airmen in the army navy air force and marines all those

2568
03:05:23.06 --> 03:05:25.30
What do you call people that work in the air air dales?

2569
03:05:26.66 --> 03:05:28.66
There's still marines, huh? There are marines

2570
03:05:29.14 --> 03:05:32.82
Well to all of you that own the skies

2571
03:05:34.58 --> 03:05:38.18
You all have your own aviation units inside all the service branches

2572
03:05:38.18 --> 03:05:41.78
And as much as i love the ground pounders and the doe boys and you know i do

2573
03:05:44.10 --> 03:05:46.10
It's you all

2574
03:05:46.10 --> 03:05:48.58
Up in the sky that cover for us on the ground

2575
03:05:49.06 --> 03:05:55.86
So thank you for your service and sacrifice and also thank you to our police and law enforcement firefighters paramedics

2576
03:05:55.86 --> 03:06:01.38

2577
03:06:01.38 --> 03:06:07.46
All the first responders thank you for your service and sacrifice as well and for protecting us here

2578
03:06:08.34 --> 03:06:10.34
on the home front

2579
03:06:10.34 --> 03:06:13.62
And to everyone else out there. There's a part in this book

2580
03:06:15.30 --> 03:06:21.06
Where bud is talking to his granddaughter's class and it's 40 years after the war

2581
03:06:22.34 --> 03:06:27.30
And one of the students asks something like what is the hardest thing?

2582
03:06:28.50 --> 03:06:30.50
about being a pilot

2583
03:06:30.50 --> 03:06:33.14
And without hesitation he replies

2584
03:06:34.18 --> 03:06:36.18
losing friends

2585
03:06:37.06 --> 03:06:43.30
And we get to read this book and we get to hear about the life and experiences of bud anderson

2586
03:06:43.30 --> 03:06:46.90
But as i said earlier just remember that there are

2587
03:06:47.78 --> 03:06:50.50
hundreds of thousands of stories

2588
03:06:52.02 --> 03:06:54.02
That we never heard

2589
03:06:54.50 --> 03:06:56.50
Lives that were cut short

2590
03:06:56.90 --> 03:06:58.90
In the sky on the ground

2591
03:06:58.90 --> 03:07:00.90
And at sea

2592
03:07:01.70 --> 03:07:05.30
Brave souls who sacrificed everything

2593
03:07:06.74 --> 03:07:08.74
For us

2594
03:07:09.14 --> 03:07:11.14
Let us never forget

2595
03:07:11.38 --> 03:07:13.38
those heroes

2596
03:07:13.46 --> 03:07:18.58
And let's make sure we are living lives that honor that sacrifice

2597
03:07:20.74 --> 03:07:22.74
We owe them at least

2598
03:07:24.18 --> 03:07:26.18
That much

2599
03:07:26.18 --> 03:07:31.38
And until next time this is dave and echo and jaco out
