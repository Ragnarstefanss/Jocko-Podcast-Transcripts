He knows exactly what you're getting into exactly And he gave you some good advice which we're gonna find out you did not listen to All right Uh boot camp here we were issued our new nice green uniforms and all the good stuff that comes with it underwear socks boots and blankets are new friends The drill sergeants marched us or at least we called it marching over to get our first army haircut It took about one minute, but it was free and you know what they say you get what you pay for I'd only been in the army a few days when our company was brought into one of our training buildings There was this big bad looking rainbow guy who was looking for volunteers for the green berets I didn't know a lot about the green berets, but I did know they were one of the most elite fighting units in the army This guy looked as though he could have kicked any 10 of us at once I thought if I'm going to war I want to go with the best so I raised my hand when he asked if anyone wanted to volunteer for the green berets Special forces I knew this would cost me another year of service But I figured another year is worth the price to pay to be among the army's best I guess those a poor listener when it came to my dad's advice about volunteer You know my thoughts were Okay, the good Lord is with me and with us and We're gonna be all right, but I got to do my day and whatever it takes, you know One of my biggest fears was what I freeze you know having never been in combat You know, I mean I've heard of guys that've been in combat before freezing Even guys that've been in for a long time You know, but that was a concern of mine what I'd be able to but all the old timers kept coming up to him and said don't hesitate Don't have a safety whatever you do it on hesitate was there anyone else that had no combat experience So there was four of us had never been in combat before hell and how many out of 56 four of us Never been in combat but I can tell you I am living proof that what they we trained on probably saved a bunch of lives You know and Awesome life lesson Going back to the book you said is one of the six guys assigned to guard the tactical operations And I started to see that I might miss out on some of the key training if I wanted to have a chance to get in selected for one of the assault force teams I had to train when I was not pulling guard duty Security was so tight that we didn't know who we would be rescuing or in what part of the world the mission would take place There was a lot of speculation that it might be an attempt to free prisoners in Cuba Based on the three hour flying time of the mission I had been training and pulling guard duty for about a month when I got my chance to speak up I was checking Colonel Bill's whole Simon's For access to the talk building while we were waiting for an escort to take the bull in He asked how things were going for me I knew that he was only going to pick some of us for the actual mission I think there was somewhere else you thought you might be going to replace hijacked on tarmacs around the Camorole that we thought we might be going into Rescue you know people on hijacked planes, so you have no idea what you're doing No, which and everybody you know it was we didn't know we just knew we were gonna do some type of rescue and We trained Fort and did you know that it was real? But like any kind of adventurous and this is brought just my experience like the bias I came from my experience with meeting all these guys We're gonna make a think doing all these Adventurous things, you know, where it's like you go through these crazy missions or all these crazy military experiences You come home and boom Let's switch missions into some other quote-unquote Adventurous scenario, you know and a lot of people a lot of us or not us, but a lot of people do that So like you don't have to you know not everyone's gonna come home and start a tactical shooting company You know like that's not That's not the normal thing what makes it seem normal is you know when someone owns a tactical shooting company that they were a veteran So you neutralize everybody on the way through and that was our orders and that's what we did and you know the Our way of clearing a building is quite different in the way they cleared a day We didn't worry about collateral damage, you know, you were the bad guy and that's what it was gonna be So we made sure that We neutralized and moved on to the next building Now, were you worried about where you're What did you guys plan in such a way that your bullets That were going through this building that there was no friendlies on the other side Did you guys have the whole thing kind of mapped out? and You know you learned You know all the basics of you know patroling things like that they went into a little more advanced, you know how to set up ambushes He always told us if you're gonna do anything Do your best correct That's an important one You go on to say here as the member as a member of the advanced party another one of our tasks was to build this large mock-up of buildings Using target canvas as the walls with doors with cutouts for windows we began constructing it on Thursday September 10th and it took us Several days to complete we didn't know why we were having to build it it wasn't until we did our first walk through during our initial training That I realized how it would be used Even then we had no idea it was a Dimensionally perfect replica of all the buildings and walls of the POW camp in saante North Vietnam Two by four is whatever jam two by four is near the dirt and then build little buildings Full size walk-throughs It looked like toilet paper on wrapped on a Two before so it reminded me you know, but and one of the things we finally clarified in and the book was Everybody said we used to take it down every night I'll put it in unedited into the book and I got about 40 of them and Some are one paragraph summer three or four five pages, you know, but it's their memorable moment on the raid Or about the rate or whatever might be and you know, it just gives a whole different perspective, you know from a P.O. W. standpoint to a guy flying at you know Mid midcap overs and it really It was empty At this time we started to move back to the LZ for extraction We still moved with these assumption that there could be more enemy soldiers lying in the bushes While the helicopters were and route were returning to extract us One of red wines rolls was to clear the planned LZ by cutting down certain light poles that task revealed one frustrating Surprise we had brought a chainsaw to cut down certain wooden telephone poles But sergeant first class Charles, Maston and sergeant first class Ronnie straight hand were to blow up a tall concrete light pole The moment that Maston and Strahan finished placing the four one pound packets of c4 explosive We're ready to blow and we're conforming confirming that they should activate the fuse apple one was arriving They waited until apple one had landed offloaded green leaf and departed Ensured of safety they detonated the c4 as the pole rose into the air a huge flash of light Maston and Strahan could See that this was not a light pole it had four large high tension power lines Dancing sparks were everywhere as the four huge power lines hit the rice patties the very rice patties And which our soldiers and POWs would be marching to load the returning chalpers We were going to have to find a new location where are we going to have to find a new location for the LZ Maston, Strahan and Captain Jim McClam as the marshalling area control officer immediately set about ensuring They understood the location of all the wines and whether they were hot After assessing the situation and ensuring there were no other potential hazards they began placing the bean bag lights in an area suitably distant from the power lines As everyone returned to the LZ waiting for the helicopters we had a few minutes to gather people and equipment to load on apple one and apple two You just not go into your life lessons in here Don't be a complainer the world is moving on and needs people to solve problems A value at your situation make a decision and execute any new plan without complaining and feels or for yourself Not gonna help Not gonna help the situation. yeah like dips you feel dips you feel good put but muscle ups too like when you get done with muscle ups You feel like kind of jacked all the way around Yeah, so you know when chasing gardeners at the other day that he takes a one Discipline go pill in the morning that's he I haven't tried it yet, but that seems like a good move Just to get a little a little kicker And you know That that probably Is one of the more Important messages that I think Could come out of this book because I think the training that we did saved our lives because we had I mean we had 177 rehearsals and Part of those were alternate you know like if red wine went down It was red wine alternate red wine greenly went down was alternate greenly right Um, took your first airplane ride after AIT you say I experienced my first airplane ride It took me from Fort Leonard wood to Fort Benning, Georgia Jump school as much as I expected a lot of running and push-ups and when you screwed up and morning inspections I went through jump school in August Fast forward a little bit here you said I had the good fortune going through jump school with some navy seals from team two if I recall correctly When they learned that I was headed for special forces training they decided they would adopt me into their ranks The water troughs we were we had were about a foot deep and 18 inches wide the seals stopped Up one of the troughs and filled it with water then about six of them grabbed me and dunked me in the water until I thought I was going to drown From then on they deemed me an honorary seal I guess you might say I had my first taste of water boat boarding They were actually great bunch of guys one day we were headed back to the barracks after a day training one of the seals was made to run around the platoon while we did the airborne shuffle But you know I went through basic seal training and there you get to eat and you get to eat Actually a lot most of the time you're getting three meals a day and usually one or two of them are in a Chow Hall where it's basically all you can eat and I always feel You know the Rangers that get one MRE day for whatever that is you know 85 days and you know you do things that You know I started driving a tractor I was six years old You know as you know was just I had to keep it between the bales You might have the fastest kill on enemy territory that you step off for your immediately engaging your guy That's kind of crazy to think about You go on captain Dan thanks me as we charge towards our first building I am following captain Dan with bullets blazing and men moving to their positions alternate playing green is proceeding We hear our chopper apple to loudly lift off the rice patties to wait about a mile away until they're called back in to take us home with the POWs We came to free and the back of our minds if these birds get battled damage it will be a long way back to friendly lines No time to think about that We move forward to clear our designated buildings nearest nearest to us Master Sergeant Joe Lupiak and his red wine element two which includes him Sergeant first class tyrone Adderley and Sergeant first class Billy Martin each of us knew this was going to be much more difficult than it was during training These are buildings that green leaf group would have neutralized according to the original plan and they would have had 14 of their men on this task Under alternate planned green Five of our team were now going to have to do it We'll make them pay for every foot across that Sonté for about four seconds You could have heard a pin drop Then like a cannon shot Everyone bursts out shouting, woooping, hollering, slapping each other on the back Raring like Broncos yelling, let's go get them Both tries to bring us back to Earth by explaining in no uncertain terms That he estimates each man has a 50-50 chance of returning alive from this mission He states that this is strictly a volunteer mission If any man has a reason that he should not go on this mission, he should decide now Not a single man backed out The whole meeting, including Lieutenant Colonel Sidner's portion lasted no longer than ten minutes And that right there is an excerpt from a book called Who will go into the Sonté POW camp written by Terry Buckler and is about one of the most famous Special Operations missions of all time the attempted POW rescue on the Sonté prison camp in Vietnam And the author Terry Buckler a special forces soldier green beret Was on that raid He was actually the youngest man on that mission I'm sure it's you know most kids were their terminology is like You know merch is like obviously we know what that means. I mean when you you're getting you might have been easy for you I had one of my guys worked on a dairy farm up in Minnesota and for him being in the military was easy it was a vacation I agree You know it wasn't I remember that you know we had a My DI who was a veteran Vietnam found out that I was going to jump school and There was another Palmer 17 year old Palmer and that guy got me and more trouble he was going to jump school I mean I know I know you know Adam when we're graven he wrote It was sort of like his feces when he was at the post graduate school about all the Most important special operations missions in history Yeah, that's the part you know an hour before we took off is when we knew where we were going So Let's security was for our own benefit Absolutely, so you know, I'm never questioned why they kept out of secret I was just glad they did you know, so Well, I'm glad we can hear about the secret now and thank you for joining us out here My pleasure has been a real honor to be in all the veterans out there. So Getting into some of this training you say our our training began with us walking through our positions Over and over again in daylight during the first month There were several changes to how we performed our mission each person had specific tasks to perform Not only do we have to know our own role, but we had to know the role of the man to our left and right and where they would be when the Firing started Captain Dan and I were a two-man team As the RTO for red blind security group my job as Captain Dan put it I want you at arms length for me or I will be the one to shoot you We were told to go to our barracks immediately after we finished eating and get some sleep To ensure we got some sleep lieutenant-cruel Joe Kataldo our doctor who would be going on the mission and into the compound with us Required everyone of us to take a sleeping pill as we exited the mess hall as we walked toward the barracks the old timers Explain that they had never had to do that before it was pretty clear that this would be the night I spent the rest of the afternoon walking around the compound and talking to the other raiders about what they thought was going on The time passed very slowly that afternoon by 5 p.m. everyone was awakened from our bunks and told to get to the mess hall for dinner then meet in the theater in 1800 By 1730 we started filling the theater you could tell Everyone was getting pumped for what we were about to learn And this is where you get the the speech that I opened this whole thing up with where you finally find out Where you're where you're actually going these are got no idea and that the way you write about that that reaction that everybody had Mm-hmm. He's got a Facebook page if you want to check out his Facebook page see what he's up to Facebook at Terry Buckler and Thank you once again to Terry Buckler for coming on for sharing his experiences and thanks to Terry and the rest of the Sontay Raiders The mighty special forces green braze and the other support personnel the pilots the air crew that took the risks to attempt to rescue our fellow service men And thanks all the military personnel out there right now who are willing to take risk to protect and secure freedom around the world and thanks For the work done by our police and law enforcement Firefighters paramedics EMTs dispatchers correctional officers board of patrol secret service and all first responders who sacrifice To protect and secure us and our way of life here at home and to everyone else out there Remember some of the key lessons from Terry Buckler today Add humor to your life Especially in tough situations be excellent in everything you do always train and improve Be patient but no end to be aggressive don't be a complainer don't be indispensable be thankful for those who sacrifice for our freedom and Be prepared for death Make sure the day that you meet your maker isn't the first time you've been introduced Because if you're prepared for death you are free to live life fearlessly and that Is a good plan So go out there and get after it just just whatever paper or whatever From all this training you put together life lesson three You say in your work always be training and improving during the first month of our training There were several changes made to how we approached our positions I learned a very important lesson in vest timing time and training it pays off Just like a football team trains for the big game We were training for our big game the major difference our lives depended on how well we performed Training sometimes gets boring but when the bullets start flying in both directions You're sure glad that you know what is expected of you and your team members and I and I think it really worked if you You know some of the after action reports that that came back Said that you know some of the and the mixed in him could off the ground because they were confused as Where they were coming from and you know we were dropping flares over Hanoi and while we were sneaking into backside To San Tei so all their attention was coming from the Gulf of Tauk and and There was a Sam site just south of us and any aircraft as well. But you know the impact that you all had was just incredible and Amazing to be able to sit here and and talk to you some someone from a raid that I've studied and read about for many many years And just an incredible Opportunity to be able to sit here and talk to you and and hear these stories From you for everybody out there The book is just incredible piece of history and it's it's available on Kindle if you're one of these digital people there's an audio book Traditional print You know whether you want soft cover hard cover, but just an incredible book go out and get it we just covered a fraction of the stories today It's an amazing amazing piece of history. I thought somebody was shooting you know, but it was it was Dan shooting all right, but I'm shooting the guy that that was gonna take me out so I Approaching 0228 lieutenant Colonel Sidner received notification that green leaf group is not out a commission We can hear apple one landing and are told the hold fast until green leaf elements get to their original plan positions With 22 men of green leaf team including bullseimants We are back on track within one minute green leaf has secured the guard quarters per the plan and takes over their rules that the red wine team members Have been handling for them Again, that's a comp that seems real easy and that was your attitude Eventually you sat to say you know what weathering first weathering last if it's my time it's my time I can only control so much and you know that point was really driven home last week when my wife passed away that You know No man should feel that way That's why we are going in there after them You are to let nothing nothing interfere with the operation Our mission is to rescue prisoners not to take prisoners If there's been a leak We'll know it by the time the second or third chopper sets down If we're walking into a trap if it turns out that they know we're coming Don't even dream about walking out of North Vietnam Unless you've got wings on your feet We'll be a hundred miles from Louss I placed the green dot from my Armolite single point site on the guards chest and fire three rounds He immediately falls to the ground and that instant I don't hesitate what the season warriors taught me really paid off Don't hesitate I imagine most of the warriors In your first time downrange wondering the back of your mind how you responded that moment what I freeze when I faced with the Decision to kill or be killed I had only just stepped on to the enemies ground and I had my first kill There'd be more to come as we cleared the buildings Out of the gate You know, I watch a lot of Fighting and they always talk about you know Who's got the fastest record knockout in a fight? But with bull being in charge and all the you know we saw a lot of Brass around us, you know this is the first mission ever to be in the direct control the joint chiefs of staff We didn't know that at the time either.
